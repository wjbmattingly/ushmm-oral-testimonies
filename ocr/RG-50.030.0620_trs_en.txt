discharged.  The y had t o come back, you know, because the war broke out right  after 
that.  And I went t o    from Camp Grant I went  to, I guess it was Texas    Brownwood, 

Texas and Camp Campbell, Kentucky and Indi o, CaliforniA:  I spend a whole year out 

there.  The y were preparing us to go to Africa and we got  sent to Germany.  After that we    
because we were built at Indio, California, the desert traini ng center, there was nothing 
there when we got t here.  After that we went to New York and we departed for Europe 

and we landed in Marlborough.  We were on t he Queen Mary.  We had 23,000 people on 

that ship.  We slept in shifts, more or less.  And it took us a long ti me, because the y were 
sayi ng that, be careful, you know, after the big boat, you know, Queen Mary     
Q: You mean the subs were after the boat?  
A: Yeah.  I mean, so we landed in Marlborough, England and we stayed there for a while.  
The y had the invasi on    and I think we went about three weeks, or two weeks after the 

invasion, because t he y had to make room for us to land because of the fighting there and 

stuff.  When I got t here, you could still see shi ps, their nose up, I mean.  We had to sta y 
on the landing barges for a da y or t wo before we went to shore, you know.   
Q: Yes.  Let's back up for just a lit tle bit.  How did you feel about bei ng drafted?  
A: Well, I didn't    I didn't feel so good.  Because at that ti me we had soldiers    and dogs 
weren't allowed in the taverns and (inaudible) they didn't allow us there, so, but, like I 

say, I was one of the first draftees to go.  I just     I al most had    I didn't care about it, 

because I had eight months in and who wanted, you know, the arm y?   If all of them wants 
to go and then the war broke out and I had to get    go and, you know, and then we didn't

now how long the war was going to last, whet her it was going to last a year, two years, 
five years, ten years or a hundred year war or whatever it i s.  But , that's the wa y it was.  
Q: What di d you train as, sir?  What were you    an infantryman? an armorman?   
A: No, I was a medic.  But we had basic training, because, you know, everybody had to 
take basic training.   
Q: How did you feel about being a medic?  

A: Well     
Q: Did you select it or were you assigned?  
A: No, I was assigned as a medic, because t hey were aski ng peopl e t o drive for 
(inaudible) and stuff like that.  But, I took the medics, because I t hought it was safer than 
being in the gutter or somewhere in there.  
Q: Uh huh.   

A: So, that 's what it was.  

Q: 
Do y
ou feel that your training adequately t rained you for combat?  
A: Oh, yeah.  We had t o have combat training and then     especially i n the desert with the 
tanks, maneuvers and stuff.   We had good trai ning over t here in the desert.  The heat was 

125 out there.  We actually, someti mes didn't do anything, but t o get used to the weather, 

you know.  But, I had a suntan.  I wore shorts all the ti me and you could see the white 
here and all black here.  

Interview with John Truty 
 
6 
Q: What di d you understand of the war and why it was being fought, before going to 
Europe?  
A: Well, I didn't think too much of it.  I mean i t's war.  War is a war.  I mean you have to    
nobody likes war.  I mean as far as that goes, war is hell.  But    we    you're i n there, you 

got to do t he best you can, because there was a lot of fellows that didn't like it  and 

committed sui
cide and all that but, thank G d, I held out and I come back in one piece.  

That's the main thing.   
Q: Did you know what was happening to t he Jews of Europe before you went over?  
A: No, I di dn't, no.  

Q: Do you speak any foreign languages?  
A: I used t o read and write Polish, but I forgot, I mean, it's been a long ti me, 60, 70 years 
almost.  
Q: What di d you do when you were in England?  Were you still training?  
A: Training, yeah.  We were waiting for the invasion, you know, because the y would 
send out ships (inaudible) and they were testing out the Germans there, you know, 

because the y had all the coastline all pretty well fortified and we landed in England, the y 

had    we had gas masks, because England was all set for    if they would get poisoned gas 

an
d stuff and in case the Russians    the Germans, but the y were fighti ng two fronts, in 
the back and in the front and Russians, and us, you know, so the y had double trouble 
there, and once we could go    got  along pretty good.  

Interview with John Truty 
 
7 
Q: What di d you think of England and the English?  
A: Well, I didn't think too much of them, you know, we made friends and stuff.  They're 
all right, I mean, I suppose you couldn't get used to it, but, the y had it  a little different, 

like petrol and gasoline and all that  stuff.  We had to learn English and French and 
German and Polish and America, I mean, yeah, so     
Q: When did you enter the European theatre?  D Da y plus what?  

A: How many da ys what?   

Q: How many da ys after D Day di d you land in France?  
A: D Da y was    what day was 
D Day? 
 
Q: June.   
A: Four?  I think i t was two weeks.  

Q: Oka y.  Do you recal l your first exposure to combat?  

A: Recall t he first exposure?   

Q: The first ti me you saw combat?  

A: No.  We seen shells coming over from    while we were still in England, but they had    
let me see    88's and st uff in the bunkers and t hey couldn't find them at first, you know, 
they shooti n', put 'em back in.  But  the y got it later on when they after invasion.  The y 

found out that the (inaudible) people right i n front of you, you know what I mean, but    

cause we were (inaudible) division.  We had to take care of all divisions.  Some go and 

Interview with John Truty 
 
8 
some come.  You have to be well prepared for that.  Our general got the stars from every 
time Patton got promoted, he got    Walker got  stars and stuff and so     
Q: 
Did youever meet General Wal ker? 
 
A: Walker?  Oh, yeah he was right there, our general.  I never met Patton.   

Q: Did you like General Walker?  Did you respect him?   

A: Oh, yes, he was a good general.  But Patton was kind of rough.  I mean, he was    I 
was kind of scared of him.  Every time I knew he was coming I'd stay away from 
headquarters there.   
Q: Sure.   
A: So, I di dn't  want to get a slap in the face (laughing).  No, but that's his job.  So, I 
mean, he had to do it, him with hi s 45's.  But     cause some generals they    Patton wanted 
a credit, Eisenhower wanted a credi t, MacArt hur wanted a credit, Bradley wanted a 
credit, and Churchil l wanted    I mean, the y all wanted to outdo one another, but, I guess 
they got along, so     
Q: When you got t o Europe, when you got  to France, do you remem ber the first battle 
you were engaged in?  
A: No, I don't remember.  There was shooting going on t here and stuff.  
Q: Do you remember crossing the Rhine?  
A: Yeah.  

Interview with John Truty 
 
9 
Q: Oka y.  What can you tell me about that?  
A: Well, the y build them platoons and we crossed.  
Q: Did you engage the Germans there?  Did you engage t he enemy during the crossing 
the Rhine?   
A: We didn't, t he peopl e in front of us did.  I mean, there were tanks and infantry.  There 
were troops in front of us.  We took care of the troops that, you know, invaded them.  

Cause we had our own little G1, G2, G3, G4, we had to care of officers and enli sted men, 

to give them shots and whatever the y needed.  But, we didn't go right up to the front 

because we had    Patton had his men up t here.  All he wanted was tanks, tanks, t anks, t he 
hell with t he infantry.  You see tanks all al ong the road there, and t hat was it.  
Q: Did    when you were actually in Europe     

A: Yeah?   
Q: did you    and after having served in combat did your attitudes about the war change at 
all?  
A: Well, sure it changed.  I mean, it's    glad it  was over.  I mean, we be    the y sent    I 
had 92 points, I mean, i t was enough to get a cross, but t he y sent the people, the soldiers 

in front of me, that were rookies and stuff, and the y just come after me and stuff, they 

didn't have enough points, the y send them back to USA to train them to go back t o    not 

train them, but to revitalize them to go back to Pacific, you know.  So, we had    I was 

like    they asked me first if I wanted an arm y occupation and I di dn't want that, I wanted 

Interview with John Truty 
 
10 
to get home, the heck with that.  So, they left me there anywa y.  And there is no revelling, 
no retreat, no nothi ng.  But we went horseback riding and then we could play golf, and 

nobody to, you know, bother you or stuff.  But then later on, we got t hrough in Japan, 
they dropped the atomic bomb there, so     
Q: As you were moving through Europe and advancing with the Third Army, do you 
recall coming across any concentration camps?   
A: Oh, I di dn't come across but there were a lot of them there.  The y t old us.  They had us 
scattered all around.  
Q: Did you see any of them?  

A: Well, Buchenwald.  That's the only one that  I really seen there, you know.   
Q: Tell me about experiencing Buchenwal d.  When did you arrive there?  What di d you 
see?  What did you thi nk was goi ng on?   
A: Well, I rode wit h the captain.  He was a medical officer, he got di scharged (inaudible) 
colonel later on, but , I had to with go wit h hi m, and he and I went in a jeep, and seen the 

camp.  And we seen how the soldiers    they had a flagpole    they tri ed to get out, 

because the y knew we were coming and the Germans shot them and left.  They were 

right by the flagpole there and stuff.  But    so    and then the only way we could see them 

is    the y wouldn't allow us to feed them or anyt hing like that, the y were fed 
intravenously, the ones that were ready to die anywa y, I mean, but     we got in cause we 
had m
edical     I had a van and, you know, I was with the captain, so, he was a medical

officer.  So, they let us in and we went in t he camp there, and it stunk and the tears and 
the urine and all that  stuff.  I couldn't stand it.  I went through one barracks there, that 

they had there, and t he trains were j ust lined there and the y were peei ng and stuff and it 
was just    I couldn't st and it, so, I just left after that.  
Q: Did you speak to any of the pri soners?  

A: No, I di dn't speak to them.  

Q: Did you provide any medical assistance to any of the prisoners?  
A: Not we.  But t he y took care of them, I mean, the y emptied the soldiers    the y try to 
get, you know, them out of the way first, because they were dead, but the ones that  were 

still in there, the y t ook them    I don't know where the y took them, the hospitals or 

something, and tried to rejuvenate t hem, you know, because they were all skin and bones, 

I don't think they'd live anywa y, but you try it and stuff, they were so glad to see t o us.  

Because the y had a t abl e like this, the y had lampshades made out of skin, you know, they 
took the skin and made lampshades out of them or anythi ng they could use.  And, of 
course, they had hair, I seen it, they stripped them with    the y got  shoes and stuff up 
there, and that was i t.  
Q: Did any of the prisoners try to speak to you, or sa y anyt hing t o you?  

A: No.  The y just want ed to somet hing to eat, you know, and stuff.  They couldn't speak, 
I mean, they're layi ng there like four or five of them in a l ittle space.  It was terrible.  
Q: How long were you inside the camp itself?  

Interview with John Truty 
 
12 
A: In the concentrati on camp?   
Q: Yes.   
A: Not too long.  I coul dn't stand it.  It  stink and smudge and stuff.  I don't know how 
they could survive.  
Q: Did you see any enem y inside the camp, living or dead?  

A: No.  But later on, I did see enem y soldiers after they surrendered.  The y put t heir guns 
in a big pil e and they'd hand these prisoners to the Frenchmen, you know, and the French 
took over and especiall y SSS guys.  The y hated   the Frenchmen hated SS    the
y were 
supposed to be the elite of the arm y there.  So, the y take them and march them in the 
forests and you could hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, the y got aim with t hem.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: Some of them t hat    like I sa y, mostly SS guys that the y didn't, 
they hatedand stuff 
but     
Q: Now, was that t he French unit that was marching with 20 corps?  

A: Yeah.  I don't know how the y got attached to them, I mean, but  they let them have    
the French    the German prisoners, so     
Q: Did you see the cremat oria at Buchenwald?  
A: Yeah.  

Q: You did?  Can you describe what you saw going in to that area?  

Interview with John Truty 
 
13 
A: Well, seeing these bodies right there, packed like 2 by 4s, you could see the y're all 
skin and bones.  And in the back    the crematoria, there was all ashes that they emptied 

out.  Because they had two like    two small freight cars and they put them in and they 

take them out.  I didn't see that    seen them doing it, but I seen the ovens there, you 
know.  I tri ed to take a picture, but it didn't come out.  It blurred and stuff, all black.  But 
you could still make out a little bit that it was t he freight cars, them little freighters.  
Q: After seeing Buchenwald, after seeing t he concentration camp, di d it change your 
attitudes about the war and why you were fighting it?  
A: Yeah.  Then I real ized that we had to do it, I mean, after all, otherwise it will kill 
everybody.  Especially the Polish people, because there's a lot of Jews in Poland there 
and stuff, and they first  took the Jews and then probably t he next, Poli sh    and I still got 
cousins and aunts and    living there.  
Q: Living in Poland?  
A: Yeah.  In fact, I went to see them in 1982 with my sister, because my wife didn't want 
to go, so I took m y sister there and we spent  t wo or three weeks there.  
Q: After you left the camp, did you meet any of the surrounding popul ation who lived 
around the camp.   
A: Not really, no.  There wasn't  too many left there.  It's just a woman that was    women 
and kids maybe, that's all, but the guys were in the arm y and stuff and there's healthy 

Interview with John Truty 
 
14 
guys and stuff.  But, I didn't meet any of the ol der folks, because there was none left, I 
mean, the y were starvi ng too.  
Q: How long were in t he area around Buchenwald?  

A: I don't know.  Maybe a couple of days, and we went on.   

Q: You pushed int o Austria after this?  
A: Yeah.  We wound up in Austri a with t he R ussians there.  
Q: Do you remember    did you meet up with t he Russians?  
A: No.  I didn't talk to t hem, but the guys in front of us did, you know, we stopped there 
and we come back.  
Q: How did you learn about V E Da y?  
A: How did I learn?  Well, it was in the papers and stuff.  We were glad it was over.  But, 
I know there is another war going on with Japan.  We weren't through yet, but, that was a 
piece of cake, I mean, as far as after they put t he atomic bomb and st uff. 
Q: How long were you in Europe after V E Day?  How long did you stay after?   
A: Oh, I stayed unt il the war was over in Japan, and then the y shipped me back.  They 
must have sent some Arm y of Occupation or something, earlier on, to take care of that.  

So, like I sa y, we had it made    it was a piece a cake.  We were pla ying golf    we 

couldn't play golf because we didn't have no golf balls.  But, I wanted to come home 

regardless, I mean, they could give me a milli on buck, of course, I wasn't too long 

Interview with John Truty

overseas    a year and a half oversees    but in the arm y four and a half years.  So, but    
it's still a long ti me, I mean, it's the best years of my life.  
Q: Why so?  Why do you call them the best years of your life?  
A: Well, I went in when I was 22, 23 years ol d.  And by the time I spent four years, or 
almost five years and by t he ti me you can get out and adjusted to civilian life and I got in 
business and so     
Q: What rank were you on discharge?  

A: What rank?  T/4, surgical technician.  

Q: And, did you come back to Chi cago i mmediately after the war?  Is that where you 
came?  
 
A: Not    we went t o some kind of a camp t here in    and t hen they gave me 300 bucks    I 
guess    bi g deal    for traveling expenses.  So, I saved, I mean, because we were in the 
arm y, it was $21 a month.  By the ti me you get  your cleani ng done and stuff, we had to 

wear civilian clothes and get that cleaned and, of course, we got rati ons (inaudible) all 

that free, you know.  But, still in all, you go out and have a couple of beers or something    

and of course, beer was cheap, but you didn't    I was alwa ys broke.  Getting the crap 
game, and, you know, waiting another month.  Yeah, it was rough.  
Q: When you came home to the United States, who was the first fami ly member you 
saw?  
A: First member?   

Interview with John Truty 
 
16 
Q: First family member that you saw when you returned to the United States?  
A: Well, I'll tell  you truth, we didn't have a car.  My dad didn't have a car, he was a 
foreigner.  He couldn't speak Engli sh, he was a citizen.  But I don't know how he got hi s 

citizenship.  But, I stopped    I took a train, and I stopped in the t avern I used to go to, 

because it was like a block and a half away, instead of going strai ght home, I stopped in 

the tavern, had some couple of beers, and t hey were all gl ad to see me there, seen some 
friends, and before you knew it, half a crowd    and then I went home.  The y were glad to 
see me, and m y mother had two st ars in the wi ndows, you know, she was so proud of me.  
But, that was it.  
Q: What was it like for you seeing your family again, your mother and your fami ly?  

A: It was great.  I mean, I was overjoyed, cause like I say, I didn't know how long I was 
going to be in the servi ce, in the army, because, you know, you are a long ways from 
home and, of course, we went back on a boat, on a small boat, but we didn't come back 

on a Queen Mary like    because, I don't  know why.  Well, anywa y I was sure glad to get 
home.  
Q: What di d you do after the war?  
A: After the war I got a job.  I didn't work too long, about a year and a half, and then I got 
into business.  My buddy's father had a restaurant.  He was in part nership with a guy in 

Chicago close to the Loop, and they had an argument there, so he sai d you buy me out or 

I buy you out.  So, he didn't have too much money, so he asked me if I would like to get 

Interview with John Truty 
 
17 
into business, and I didn't have any mo
ne y, my daddidn'thaveany money,so m y dad 
had to borrow mone y, he trusted me.  I don't know why    m y partner in the restaurant 
business, he kind of figured I was    you know, I could save a buck, I wasn't t oo    so, he 

said, you'll get that back in no time.  I took his word for it, and I t old m y dad, I sa ys, if 
you can borrow some mone y, and m y dad had some good friends and he borrowed 6,000 
bucks, I think it was, and he    I got in partnership with hi m.  It worked out in no ti me.  I 

paid m y dad out first, and then I was sitti ng prett y.  I bought a car, and I had a pretty good 

life after that, I mean, hey, while the sun was shining, because, you know, the y had to go 

to Wisconsin to buy    t o slaughter.  You have to get some    everyt hing was rationed    

not yet    but, before that.  And so they used to go get meat there and stuff, and I was in 

the restaurant business for 27 years.  So, it  was a cafeteria style though.  But, it's not like 
what it is now.  Now you need a cashier or a manager or a this or th at or anythi ng for 
you.  We di d have about 12, 13 employees, but we were opened up from 5:30 i n the 

morning until 2, 3:00 the next morning, you know.  But, then they st art dwindli ng down, 

the neighborhood started changing.  Event uall y we only had breakfast and dinners, 

because we used to get the crowds after bowli ng and stuff.  They didn't    the y cut that 

out, I mean, the y were afraid to deliver, the neighborhood was changing, shooting and 
stuff.  I got up here.  So, I had to give it    gave it up.  
Q: Did you talk to any friends or family about your experiences in the war?  
A: Well, I told them I didn't want to scare them.  Because, m y brother, he was in the 
navy, and he says don't  tell them    mom and dad that he's going back after they took care 

Interview with John Truty 
 
18 
of his ship.  He was anxious to get back there to kill them Japs and stuff.  So, I didn't tell 
m y mother and dad    because m y dad died when he was young, 65.  And, I was    my 

mother lived to be 100    one mont h short  of being 100.  So, she was a widower for a long 

time, but she was i n a nursing home.  And don't    I mean, after    she'd be better off dead 
than living the way she lived in a wheelchai r all the time.  We had a nursing home close 
to home in Chicago, and m y sister alwa ys used to go see her every day, feeding her, and 
fixing her hair and stuff like that.  But, that was it, I mean.   
Q: Did you have the opportunity t o see the exhibition upstairs in the museum?  
A: First ti me, today, I went.  
Q: What di d you think?  
A: Nice, gorgeous, amazing.  The y shoul d show    if the people seen it real, you see it 
yourself, it's different than telling people, you know.  But, now they see    you can see the 
pictures and stuff, that's really wonderful.  
Q: Do you think it accurately    did it accuratel y portra y your exp
erience?
