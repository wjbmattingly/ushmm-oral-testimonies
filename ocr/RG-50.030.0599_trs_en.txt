Question:  The lights are on so
 it should be working.  
This is the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Muse
um interview with?  
 
Answer:  Paul Wolff.
 
Q:  Conducted by Alda Velatis (ph) on the 
16th of October 2010 at the Kindertransport 
Association Conference in Arlingt
on, VirginiA :  Let's begin.  
 
Q: I'd like to first start off by asking you to  st
ate, again, your full name, if it's d ifferent 
now than  your name of birth, da
te of birth, parents' names, siblings, family, place, all of 
that.  
 
A: All?  
 
Q: Yes.  
 
A: Okay.  My name is Paul
 Mark John Wolff. 
 For some strange reason or other my 
parents gave me the name of three saints.  
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: I have no idea why that is.  I w as bor
n Hamburg, Germany on
 the 27th of December 
1929.  My father and mother are deceased.  
My father was Carl Wolff or referred to in 
this country as Charles Wol
ff.  My mother was Erica Wol
ff, born Abeles.  The maiden 
name was A b e l e s, Abeles.  My -- I ha
ve two -- two sisters; Susan Barbara Wolff 
living today still in New York, and Eva Berta 
Wolff who died of -- of multiple sclerosis 
in San Francisco many years ago.  My sister
 in New York 's name is Fogelstein, by th e 
way.  It's n o t Wolff anymore.  She'
s married to Henry Fogelstein.  My 
 
sister in San Francisco was Hertzfeld.  Both 
married, in cidentally.  We were just talking 
about that in the conference. 
 Somehow th ere is a connection 
of survivors.  They both 
married survivors.  What else can I tell you?
  My children, do you want that too?  
 
Q: That be great.  Sure.  
 
A: Okay.  I have three children,
 all of which are, I think, are registered as K2s.  Karen 
Wolff Kirschenbaum in New 
York , the oldest; Linda Wo l
ff Dorjee, married a fellow 
from Boughton and therefore the name Dorjee
; and my son, Charle
s Wolff, in Berkley -- 
in Berkley.  I was going to -- 
oh, interesting aside.  Interes
ting aside that all three just 
recently in the last couple months became
 German citizens.  Germany has offered 

Holocaust -- children of Holocaus
t survivors citizenship if th
ey want.  Sort of -- it was 
very weird for me to have them become Ge
rman citizen s, but they did it for specific 
reasons.  They thought if -- if education gets
 too expensive in this country -- they all 
have country -- that they want
 to be members of the Europe
an union in order to be able 
to attend any university within Europe -- 
 
Q: Great ideA:
 
A: -- which is -- you know, they  have no inte
ntion of going to  Germany but this is an 
open door to the EU -- 
 
Q: Right.
 
A: -- which makes sen se, really. 
 
Q: Wonderful.  That's a r
eally good ideA:  Great.  
 
A: Okay . 
 
Q: Let's talk, if you will, about you
r earliest memo ries in Hamburg. 
 
A: Okay.  I lived in Hamburg for the first ni
ne years of my life.  I clearly remember a 
few things about school.  I can remember
 being stoned, finally, on th e way home from 
school one day by ch ildren that
 I played with just the pr
evious week.  They were, 
obviously, put up to  this by th
eir parents, but that was sort of our -- my messag e to me 
and to my  sisters to not retu
rn to school.  So th at was my  end of my  schooling in  
Germany.  I was nine years old.  I was, I 
rememb er, being angry at
 my father for not 
allowing me to join the Hitler youth, which 
you got to go on outings
, camping trips, and 
hikes and like the Boy Scouts. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: But of course as a Jew they wouldn't  
have taken me anyway.  But I really didn't 
understand too much of that at that time.  It 
didn't become really obvious to me as a nine 
year old until Kristanant (ph) when I can cl
early rememb er them, th e Gestapo, knocking 
at the gates of our house in Hamburg to  a
rrest my father as it was co mmon on the night 
of November 9th, 1938 to arrest all male 
Jews above 13 or 14 y
ears old.  I was too 
young, but they were after my
 fath er.  My father knew he 
would be arrested, but wanted 
to go together with his brother-in-law.  So
 he went over to hi
s brother-in-law's house 
and thought they would be arrested togethe
r.  My mother greeted them at the door as 
they came in, in her housecoat.  It was 
about Midnight, full of -- the housecoat, I 

remember, was full of my -- the metals th
at my father had earned fighting fo r the 
Germans in the first w o rld war.  He was a mu
ch decorated major in
 the artillery, in the 
mounted  artillery, actu ally, and was heavily w
ounded.  And she thought somehow that 
that would exclude him from bei
ng arrested, but of course it didn't.  They  didn't really -- 

weren't interested in the meta
ls.  And they  wanted to know
 where he was and they went 
and got him.  Luckily enough, he was releas
ed about a week later, because one of the 
arresting officers actually ha
d fo ught under him in the first world war and knew  him 
personally from that.  And many people we
re kept for months some were never 
released.  B u t that finally opened his ey
es that, gee, maybe we should really do 
something, try to get out of here.  He ha
s two brothers, incidentally, who are married 
and had families.  One went th
ree years earlier to France a
nd one went two years earlier 
to London.  But my father 
-- I discussed this with him 
many times -- thought like so 
many German Jews that this guy -- this ups
tar Hitler would blow 
over.  It's a passing 
thing.  We've just got to tough it out.  Things
 will get back to normal again.  And a lot of 

-- a lot of Jews, German Jews, felt almost 
more German than Jewi
sh in that respect. 
You've probably heard that before. So he made
 -- he made moves to -- after Gustalac -- 
opened his eyes and he made m
oves to try to get out.  We had a very  distant uncle in 
New Yo rk.  You had to have -- America had 
no Open  Door Policy a
nd you had to have 
somebody vouch for you over here
 that you would not become a burden  to the States or 
-- to the state or go on the welfare rolls.  
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So we finally did get an exit visa to 
England.  And we -- and on Ap ril 20th -- I 
remember April 20th, 1
939, happened to be a 
-- that's th e date of Hitler's birthday.  We 
left for England.  Stayed two months -- tw
o months in England wa
iting fo r some kind of 
transportation to  the States.  We only had a tran
sit visa in England so  it wasn't -- wasn't 

a -- couldn't be a final destination.  He stay
ed -- my father and mo
ther stayed with his 
brother in London.  I was -- there wasn
't enough room, so I was put on a farm 
somewhere in Devonshire where 
I remember being very, very 
lonely.  Couldn't  speak a 
word  of language -- couldn't  speak a word  of
 English at the time.  H ad to point to food 
and things like that and had to -- neve
r really lived on a farm before.  
 
My sisters, incidentally, went on the Kindert
ransport a few months before we left; about 
six months before.  They bo
th were adopted by British fa
milies and they were on the 
Kindertransport.  Both sister
s.  Okay.  Then we finally 
got the -- on the SS Dinzeldike 
(ph) Dutch freighter with -- had room fo
r 30 passengers going 
from London to San 
Francisco through th e Panama Canal.  Thirty 
days on the ocean.  Very exciting for a boy 
of 9. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: Get lost on the ship a
nd go to places where you're 
not allowed.  And -- and I 
reme mb er it as a very exciting -- exciting voya
ge, except we were told we were going to 
San Fran cisco and the only thing I ever hear
d about San Francisco 
was the earthquake of 
1906.  So I figured, well, probably going to  liv
e in a cardboard shack there because they 

can't have any permanent houses.  It mu st be
 all black lava sand.  I had this weird idea 
of wh at a -- what an earthquake country  would be like --
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: -- until the day we sailed un
der the Golden Gate Bridge. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: You know, and th en of course, it was -- 
it was quite -- quite different.  But it was a 
very weird expectation of where we would go. 
 At this time, my father was the only one 
of our fami ly of five that spoke English.  
He had been to  England 
as a young man.  And 
my sisters had picked up a little 
in their couple of -- in thei
r six months in England.  I 
spoke practically none at all, because dur
ing my  time in England I wasn't there long 
enough to  go to any kind of school.  Schoolin
g or anything.  So  basically I grew up in 
San Fran cisco.  And we arrived during summe
r, so by the time school started, I pick up 
a lot of English on the streets already.  Fo
r a nine year old it's very quick.  I was 
supposed to be, by my age, in
 fifth grade.  So 
they put me in fourth grad e because I 
didn't  speak enough English.  
And then they let me
 jump from fourth to sixth later on to 
catch on with my  -- to catch 
up with my  age group.  Bu t, what else can I tell you?  
 
Q: Well -- so, this is wonderful, beca
use, you know, it gives an overview --
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -- of the time.  So if it's okay, if we ju
st go back then  and th en maybe highlight some 
of the mo ments, you know, and talk -- 
 
A: Okay . 
 
Q: -- about any -- any other memories --
 
A: Yeah, sure.
 
Q: -- related to that.  So, ag
ain, in Hamburg and th en befo
re the stoning incident, had 
you experienced anything else, had you seen
 anything else?  What was going on?  
 
A: Okay.  Well, this reminds me of, as 
you know, Germany has a policy of inviting 
Holocaust survivors back
 to their original birth city.  Right?  
 
Q: Yes.  
 
A: So several years ago -- that's b een about 
eight or nine years a
go now -- we were both 
invited back; my wife to Berlin and I was i
nvited to Hamburg.  And they show you the -

- the city.  But during
 that time w h ile I was in Hambur
g at the hotel, someone from the 
archives, much like you, came 
by to interview -- have a pers
onal interview, get the story 
of each one. 
 

Q: Right.  
 
A: Okay.  So I did that interview.  And th en  several years later I was called by a movie 
producer in Germany, Nina Ko shofer -- who was Nina Koshofer, who was in the 

process of doing a very, very ambitious projec
t of a documentary on the Jews sponsored 
by German television and French
 televisions stations.  Th
at's called -- do you speak 
German at all?  
 
Q: I don't speak German.  No.  
 
A: It's called -- in English it's The Jews, Hist
ory Of A People.  In Ge
rman it's (speaks in 
German).  And it was running for -- it's a fi
v e-hour documentary.  It was running for 
five consecutive days on television, an hour each.
  It was sort of -- it ended up sort of a 
little bit like Roots was in this country , which was the history of black slavery. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: Here you may have seen it. 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Which also ran about four or five da
ys in a row.  And it was a very thorough 
documentary.  She spent three 
and a half years traveling to Israel, Lithuania, France, 
Germany, everywhere to film
 this thing.  So sh e had some good fu nding from these 
television stations.  And believe it or not, 
she brought her whole -- whole camera crew 
over to San Luis Obispo, Calif
ornia and filmed us, and filmed the Shabbat, the evening 
meal which we had to  stage on a Sunday nigh
t, instead of Friday, 
because she happened 
to be here on Sunday --
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: -- you know.  And did quite an
 extensive interview.  So th
is -- this documentary ran.  
I have a DVD of it. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: It ran both in Europe and it has not run on 
PBS yet but it's scheduled.  It's scheduled 
to run on PBS. 
 
Q: Wonderful.  
 
A: So it really starts sort of
 with Moses and ends with  ou
r family in San Luis Obispo. 
 
Q: Wow.  
 

A: So it's really long.  It's 
interesting.  But she -- the r
eason I was picked for this is 
because of this interv
iew that I did in Hamburg.  She 
ran -- she read through all these 
archives, all these interviews --
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: -- and said, I need somebody
 who has been kicked out of
 Germany who was a hero in 
the first world war.  They really wanted to 
interview my father, but
 because he wasn't 
alive anymore, so they settled with me.  And 
one of the -- one of the episodes of my life 
that they -- they staged in th is film with somebody portrayi
ng the young kid -- nine year 
old kid portraying me, which mi
ght be interesting here, was because -- you asked me to 
go back to remember things. 
 I rememb ered very clearly the Gestapo co ming in and 
surveying all our belongings, whic
h they did.  I still have a 
list of -- a very, very detailed 
list.  So many handkerchiefs, 
so much linen, so 
many knives, forks, 
and spoons; all the 
inventory.  Most of which was confiscated.  
O n es -- we were allowed to take one knife, 
fork, and spoon per person.  For a family of fi
ve we could take five 
things with us.  And 
anything of value that they wanted too,
 any ornamentation that we had around.  
 
And we had a large vase, vase, a carved glas
s vase with a gold rim on th e top.  And I 
noticed th ey were going thro ugh getting anythi
ng -- any metals of a
ny value, silver or 
gold, or anything th at they were confiscati
ng.  So wh ile they were rummaging through 
the house -- I was watching this
 -- I took this vase and held
 it under the kitchen faucet 
under hot water and wanted to see if the ri
m would come off.  And 
tapped it, and believe 
it or not, the rim came right off. 
 So they took the rim an d they
 left us the vase.  We still 
have the vase in our living room at home no
w.  They were only interested in the -- 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: -- in the metal part.  Not 
the vase.  It's a la
rge carved glass vase
.  I thought it was 
quite handsome.  Anyway, that pa
rt they staged in this -- in 
this little film, the history of 
the Jews there, and -- and a lot of my father's
 exploits in the first world war as a major.  
 
I'm not sure what else I can tell you ex cept th
e thought of this has never -- the thought of 
our background is somehow never very far 
from -- from my -- I'v e been a Professor of 
Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and 
I've concentrated on minority populations.  
I guess -- I'm guess it's related to the background
 of minorities.  And we do talk to high 
school groups and co llege groups and various gro
ups in -- in CaliforniA:  I would like to 
do th at.  I haven't done that yet in Germany. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: It would be interesting to do that in 
Germany.  Go  ahead.  Now ask me something 
else. 
 

Q: No, no.  That's  wonderful. 
 Thanks for sharing.  If it's 
okay, can we talk about your 
sisters and the family 's deci
sion, you know, the process of
 making th e decision, what 
happened , how it happened, to 
get on the Kindertransport? 
 
A: Yeah.  I've never quite figured out.  And 
you know, it's -- it's 
interesting that after 
your parents die you think of 
all the millions of questions 
that you wish you would have 
asked them, which of course, they are not as
k-able anymore.  But I was relatively frail, 
underweight and very  skinny.  And for some
 reason or another, my  parents decided to 
keep me with them and put 
them on the Kindertransport ra
ther.  Maybe they felt I was 
too young.  My wife was six months young
er than I am when she was put on the 
Kindertransport by her mo ther, you know.  It's 
also very, very hard for me to conceive, 
as a parent, to conceive of what you mu st 
feel like to give your
 child up into the 
unknown, because you generally prefer the 
devil that you know that may be existing 
with you than the devil that you don't know 
and you have no idea 
wh at you're giving 
your child to this...  In the -- 
in the film, what is it?  The 
-- "Into The Arms of Strangers" 
there is this one very emo tional scene where a father ju
st  simply pitches his baby 
through the train window and a teenager
 catches the baby and saved its life. 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: But fo r a parent to give 
up a child into the 
unknown like that is
 verydifficult.  
 
But anyway, my  sisters both went out, I thi
nk about four months befo re we did.  
Actually, on separate Kindertransports.  And 
my oldest sister, Susan, stayed with my -- 
stayed with my father's brot
her.  My younger sister Eva 
was adopted by a Jewish cab 
driver in London with whom 
she corresponded with for many 
years after she came back 
here, and was treated very well.  Some of 
the children had mu ch worse experience, as 
you probably heard.  So me were taken ad
vantage of, some were used as domestic 
servants.  But my  wife's -- my  wife was adopt
ed by a Quaker family
 and grew up as a 
Quaker and also was treated
 very well.  A lot of Qu
akers came forward to adopt 
children.  Okay.  My 
sister in New York, for example, 
I've tried to get her into the 
Kindertransport organization or su
ch.  Well, she's listed in it, 
but she really is a denier.  
She never would want to step 
foot on Germany.  Sh e would 
never -- she hasn't told her 
kids mu ch about this.  She doe
sn't  -- she really -- and she'
s -- she wa s the oldest.  She 
was actually -- I was -- yeah.  She was 16 at  the time, so she would have a better 

memo ry than anything and she's forgotten ever
ything.  Sh e's forgotten everything.  Sh e's 
reme mb ers nothing about the v
oyage, the trip, or anything. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: So, it's very interesting.  
 

My wife just recently publishe
d a book about her experience
.  Shedding Skins.  I don't 
know if she mentioned to y
ou, but she had -- she wo rked  
very closely with a Jewish 
editor in our -- in our city th
at proofread the book and would give her pointers on it.  
And shortly after that -- her publication -- this
 editor died.  And we went to the funeral 
service and learned through the editor's daugh
ter that she was also  a "Kind" and she 
never mentioned it. 
 
Q: Really.  
 
A: She never mentioned it at all.  And you 
know, they worked together for a couple of 
years.  And my  wife was just blown away  that somebody would just totally --
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: -- you know, deny th at. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: Okay.  What else?  
 
Q: Is everything okay? 
 
A: No.  I wanted to show you something. 
 
Q: Okay .  Great.  
 
A: But -- well, go ahead.  You have
 some mo re questions probably . 
 
Q: Sure.  Absolutely.  So maybe we can 
talk a little bit about 
your time in England, 
about adjusting a little bit to lif
e there.  Any friends, any -- 
 
A: No.  I wasn 't -- I was there two months. 
 I was living on a farm.  I thought I had been 
abandoned, sort of thing, because I -- I 
couldn't speak the language, and I was -- I 
remember being very, very lonely.  An
d not speak -- and people didn't speak any 
German.  I have no idea how this family was ever picked.  But finally, when we met at 
the dockside that was my first reu n ion with my
 sister s a lso where -- in England so that 
we all -- we all finally  did get on the boat 
together.  But otherwise, I -- I remember 
relatively little, little of that 
time in England.  I remember 
in San Francisco also nearly 
being kicked  out of school because I got in a 
fight with a guy that called me a dirty Jew.  
Teacher sort of picked us up by our scruffs of our neck
s and was going to kick us out.  
But I realized that -- that you 
know, the prejudice wasn't just limited to Germany.  Why 
would -- it happened here too.  I am the keeper
 of our family passports so I still have my  
-- my  Nazi passport.  We were all given 
th e middle name of Israel, as you probably 
know.  I had hair once too.  
 

Q: Just so that -- your posterity's sake, I 
am being shown a passport.  People listening 
wouldn't be able to see it.  Oh.  
And here's your photo.  Wonderful -- 
 
A: Yeah.  Actually -- 
 
Q: -- that you have it.  
 
A: -- all except Susan's photo.  I have even  my  parents' Nazi passports.  When we went 
to Germany and -- recently --
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: -- you have to show you pa
ssport as you enter the country .  I showed  them my  -- my  
Nazi passport.
 
Q: You did.  
 
A: And the guy did not 
have mu ch of a sense of humo r. 
 He said, "You know, sir, I can 
have you arrested.  I have to confiscate
 this because it has a swastika on it.  Any 

documents with a swastika on 
it are illegal in Germany." 
 
Q: Right.  Right.  
 
A: "And so you could be arrest
ed.  And this can be confiscated
."  I said, "Okay.  Forget 
it.  Here's my American passport."  
 
Q: Right.  Right.  Thank you fo r showing those to me. 
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: And thanks for, you know -- 
 
A: I don't know wh at else.  
 
Q: We can talk about other -- you know 
wh at?  Maybe ab out your parents, if you 
wanted to talk about them.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That would be wonderful.  
 
A: Yes.  Okay.  My father was a -- star
ted a coffee firm in Ha
mburg, importing coffee 
and processing it from Guatemala, 
so that's all he really kne
w was coffee.  So when we 
came to this country  he started peddling co
ffee house -- until he found a firm here, he 
started peddling coffee house to house, selli ng co ffee by the pound from house to house, 

by foot, because he neve
r learned to drive in Germany.  
He had a chauffeur.  Over here 
he just never learned to driv e, even all the 
years he was here.  But after about, oh, I'd say 
six months approximately of 
peddling coffee he realized he
 could not support a family 

of five by selling coffee, and yet that was ab
out the extent of what he knew.  So he 
found a job on the San Francisc
o waterfront and became a stev
edore.  And for the first 
time in his life really did -- did physical 
eight to five.  He was a union memb er and 
working on the waterfront.  And told me, I re
memb er, that in many ways he preferred 
that because at 5:00 he could no longer -- he
 would no longer have
 to worry about his -- 
his business.  He was - - his time  was his own.  
He worked strictly from eight to five.  It 
was tough physical work, but 
he was free of any -- any ki
nd of other concerns and 
oblig ations.  And my  mo ther started being asaleswoman in a department store.  No.  

She started -- first of all, she started cl
eaning people's houses.  She was a domestic 
house cleaner cleaning people's house for ma
ny years and then she became a sales clerk 
in a department store.  And so we all -- we
 had pitched in.  We all had some kind of 
jobs.  There was a Jewish Co uncil of 1933 wh
ich helped us get an apartment in San 
Francisco.  It helps you get settled a little b
it.  I still spoke, always, German when  I 
came home, and English in school.  So my  sist
ers also had jobs.  I started sweeping out -
- I rememb er my  first job sweeping out a plumbing store and a grocery store for eleven 

cents an hour.  I remember th
at.  When I finally figured 
out how mu ch I was making an 
hour, I quit and got the job at 20 cents an 
hour somewhere else.  But that was -- yeah, 
that was in San Francisco.  So I never really
 had a much -- through 
junior high and high 
school, I never had an y mu ch social life at al
l because I had a job after school almo st all 
the time.  S o  we all sort of -- we all sort of
 pitched in.  I was the only one of the -- I was 
the only one in my family fortun
ate enough to go to a univer
sity.  I went to U C Berkley 
and studied architecture.  And got drafted 
into the U.S. Army 
during the Korean  War, 
which was -- they sent me to Germany, whic
h was a good place to be during the Ko rean 
War.  And it was very interesting for me, be
cause I would -- this was 1955, ten years 
after the end of the war.  And I could very ea
sily put on civies and go in to a bar and sit 
down  and have a beer and listen to everybo
dy refighting the Second World War which 
was fascinating for me, you know.  And an 
awful lot of denial 
going on.  Hitler, who 
was he?  And you know -- sort of thing.  Or
 I -- I was not a Nazi.  And I always would 
ask what time -- what point they 
jo ined  the Nazi party, because 
if they joined in the late 
-- in the -- '44, early '4 5, '
43, then they prob
ab ly weren't convinced Nazis because by 
that time th ey had to join in 
order to survive.  But those wh
o joined in the early forties, 
and even the late thirties were pretty -- pr
etty convinced of that
, you know.  So  anti-
semitism was not that -- I had no desire to -- to
 live there.  I was glad, glad to be part of 
the US Army.  That was -- 
 
Q: (Inaudible).  
 
A: Yeah.  It was very interesting.  In fa
ct, I was there during the time when the Germans 
were being asked by NA TO to rearm a
nd develop their own Army .  And I was a 
corporal.  And we had -- we st
arted getting orders that when
 we meet German officers 
we were to salute.  I co uld never bring myself
 to do that.  So I'd go down the street and a 

German officer would start approaching me. 
 And of course, the -- the lower rank is 
supposed to salute first. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And the upper rank then 
returns the salute, but with me it was -- I was -- I teased 
them to call me, but they never really did.
  Bu t I would never, never salute.  Finally, 
when the officer gets up to me, he salutes -- 
 
Q: Right.
 
A: -- you know, and then I would return the sa
lute.  Or I would not -- no.  Actually, I did 
not return the salute.  But as far as expectin
g to be called out on this, and never did.  
Never did.  They  probably su
sp ected, oh, this guy's Jewish.  He's not going to  salute me. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And it was interesting at that time.  I 
did a little research on my own and found out 
that in schools nothing was -- at that time, not
hing was being taught at all about the Nazi 

erA:  They  did -- they  do now.  They have pi
cked it up a lot, but at that time, ten years 
after the war it was just total denial. 
 
Q: Right.  Right.  Great.  
 
A: Okay .  
 
Q: If you'd like, we can definitely keep ta
lking and I could proba
bly you know keep you 
here for hours.  
 
A: Well, no.  You might want to ch eck out this -- this video. 
 
Q: Abso lutely.  
 
A: This -- that is very interesting.  And 
I think the Holo caust -- you guys either would 
have one -- have it already. 
 I don't know how you -- if you 
research other -- what other 
countries do. 
 
Q: Yes.  Yes.  We absolutely do.  
 
A: Or I have some extra c
opies.  I can send you one. 
 
Q: We will -- I will definitely ta
lk to somebody about that.  
 
A: It's available in English now and in German, and I think in French too --
 
Q: Wonderful.  
 
A: -- now.  So it's a -- it's 
a good thing to have.  Yeah.  
 

Q: And maybe if we could talk
 about your children.  And you
 talked to them about -- I 
mean, obviously , you're the keep
er of family histories and -- 
 
A: Yeah.  We 're t rying not do
 the same  mi stake that I did with my  parents by not asking 
enough questions.  And now as our children 
are -- are getting older, you know, they'r e 
what, 46, 44, and 42, so 
they're -- and they  have 
children of their own. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: So particularly my  son is very, very
 -- I took -- I took him along when  we were 
invited to Germany.  Did I -- Oh.  I'm sorry.    
 
Q: -- really quick.  No.  
Actually, we can just...  
 
A: Put this back on me. 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Well, that's -- get my handkerchief out.  I undid th at.  
 
Q: Put it on a little tighter.  Great.  Okay.  
 
A: What do you want -- you want
 me to repeat something?  
 
Q: Just, if we could just
 go back a little bit about -- 
 
A: Okay . 
 
Q: You were speaking about your son.  
 
A: Okay .  My son is probably the mo st, I'd say 
the most Jewish of th
e three of us -- three 
of my  children.  And we took him with us 
to Germany fo r this visit to Hamburg and 
Berlin.  And he's  also a me mb er of Kin 2.  
He did a stint in Israel.  He speaks fluent 
Hebrew.  He joined the Israeli defense forces 
for a short time to free -- to free natives for 
fighting -- for fighting.  They train foreigners to be sort of 
domestic part of the IDF.  He 
teaches Spanish in Berkley.  Interestingly eno
ugh, it's  part of, I th
ink, our effect on our 
children that they have all gone into prof
essions, non-entrepreneurial professions, but 
they are more -- much more
 interested in working w
ith and helping people.  
 
My daughter is a physical therapist.  My 
other daughter in New York wo rks for the 
Innocence Project with Berry Sc
heck.  She's a lawyer by 
training.  Works with the 
Innocence Project.  And Charles 
teaches Spanish.  And I've been teaching, primarily 
trying to sensitize arch itects, architecture 
students to designing fo
r disabilities, working 
with disabled people.  And mo st 20 year 
old architecture students 
feel they 're to tally 
indestructible so they don't really think abou
t accessibility within a 
build ing.  So  that's 
more or less what I'm concen
trating on, and dealing a lot w
ith just diverse populations, 
designing for diversity.  So I think it's ha
d an influence on teaching and on our value 

system and in general.  I think, you know, mo
st of the people there have gone -- in the 
conference I noticed too have 
gone into some kind of -- 
of a field in the humanities 
rather than business, which is very in
teresting sort of a side effect on it --
 
Q: Abso lutely.  
 
A: -- on what's been happening.  
 
Q: Abso lutely.  
 
A: Otherwise, we'v e tried to share things with our children, tried to answer their 
questions as mu ch as possible as what we
 remember.  We wish
 we remember more 
precisely.  That's  about it.  
 
Q: Wonderful.  Well, thank you, th ank you, thank you so much for --
 
A: Okay . 
 
Q: -- for the interview and for sharing with us today.  
 
A: I'll probably think of a lot 
of things that I didn't -- I didn
't  mention, but -- in fact, you 
know -- 
 
Q: Actually -- yeah, actually, maybe that would 
be a good idea if we can take a minute.  
I can just pause it and then if you want to ju
st sit.  I have the tim
e if you have the time 
and we can -- if you have -- 
 
A: 12:30, I guess.  Yeah. 
 
Q: If there's anything th at, 
you know, you want to just
 think about and th en -- 
 
A: Yeah.  We can go ahead -- 
 
Q: Let's just do that.  So I'm going to just 
pause it and then... Great.  So we are recording 
again after a pause with Paul to collect our 
thoughts.  And once ag
ain, we discussed you 
would like to tell us about
 your grandparents.  
 
A: Yeah.  I was unfortunate to know -- only
 one of my  grandparents was alive when  -- 
when  I was born.  And that was my mother's
 mo ther; my  grandmother, Rosa Abeles, or 
Omas (ph) as we called her.  She -- we tried 
very hard th rough th e Red Cross to try to 
get her out afterwards because she refused to 
come out with us.  She was old, elderly, 

overw eight and -- and devoted only to Germany,
 really.  Didn't have -- didn't -- would 
not leave Germany under any circumstances.
  And we tried very hard  thro ugh the 
Geneva Red Cross and finally learned at th
e end of the war that she had died in 
Theresienstadt in the concentration camps inTheresienstadt where a lot of older people 

were taken.  After doing some research at 
Yad Vashem when we went to Israel years 
later, we lo oked up the date -- the dates that 
she was there, which Germany is of course 

incredible at recordkeeping.  They keep r
ecord s of everything.  
And we found that she 
was at Theresienstadt for about six months 
period until she died, probably of starvation, 
at the -- at the same time that
 my  wife's  grandmother was also at Theresienstadt.  They  
could have possibly known  each other ye
ars and years before we ever met. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: You know, I didn't meet my
 wife until 1960.  So it's ve
ry possible that they might 
have known each other, 
as it is just one of those 
very strange coincidences.  
 
I'm often asked in talks in school what affect
 this has had on -- on my faith.  And I have 
to admit that the whole experi
ence probably  made me more Jewish than I would have 
been in Germany, because we are relatively 
secular Jews and am still -- I do -- we do 
belong to  a synagogue here as we did in Ha
mburg, but it's refo
rmed.  As you know, 
Jews have reformed conserva
tive and orthodox.  So  it's 
very mu ch  on th e liberal or 
reformed side here.  But certainly, I felt mo
re Jewish because of what's happened there.  
 
It was interesting wh en we first came to
 America -- this was almo st a couple years 
before Pearl Harbor, but only -- we arrived 
here 30 days, directly 30 days after the war 
in Europe broke out.  We arri
ved on August 1st.  The war 
started September 1, 1939.  
And we were treated as enemy aliens 
here.  We were considered German.  
 
When  the Japanese were deported from the 
west coast after Pearl Harbor, there was 
serious talk about doing the same thing with th e Germans.  They never did it because 
our skin  colo r was not so obviously  different
 from everybody else 's 
skin color, but there 
was serious talk about also doing that.  I 
reme mb er th e F B I co mi
ng into our apartment 
in San Francisco, confiscati
ng a Grundig radio that we ha
d brought over because they 
thought it might receive shortwave.  It di
dn't receive shortwave of course, but they 
confiscated it anyway.  So at this time 
the Deutsch of Bund, the German Bund was 
marching up and down the streets of New Yo
rk holding demonstrations.  So  America 
really had not a clue as to what was rea
lly happening th ere at all.  And I was very 
instrumental in our little community here.  We
 just finished building the very first LEED 
certified sy nagogue in the world.  A LEED is 
an international standard for rating energy 
efficient buildings.  It simply means Leader
sh ip in Energy and Environmental Design.  
And so I was quite instrumental in getting th
at designed and built and LEED certified.  
So I am active in that respect
.  I th ink the effect that th
is whole thing has had on me 
more is to -- is to really be very, ve
ry conscious of any type -- any types of 
discrimination.  Right now I'
m working closely with a Moslem group wh ich is getting a 
lot of prejudice in our area, and in many areas
.  Kids are being picked on in school.  
There's -- there's just a lot of -- a lot of th
e same kind of ignorant prejudice.  It comes 
really out of ignorance more than anything
 else, of not understanding and not even 
wanting to understand. 
 You know, when I went back in
 the military to Germany I was 

the first Jew that many Germans had ever met,
 or had any contact with wh atsoever, you 
know.  But when th
ey said, we had no idea of what wa
s really going on, that was very 
questionable, because they -- well, maybe 
they knew enough not
 to ask the right 
questions.  That was -- but they  did see thei
r neighbors disappearing and -- and all kinds 
of things.  One thing I left out is that af
ter I got out of the US Army, I took what was 
known at the time as a GI Bill of Rights whic
h allows you to study.
  They give you a 
small stipend.  I think it was $150 a month, 
wh ich would make it very difficult to study 
in the U.S. at a university, but
 I could do graduate work  in 
architecture in Germany.  So 
against my father's  best wish
es, I enrolled at the Academy of
 Fine Arts in Munich and 
spent a couple of years there doing graduate
 work  in architecture.  Had a very , very 
international class, a 
master's program in architecture.
  And a professor, who had fo ught 
on th e front in the -- Sep Ru f, a well known  ar
chitect in Germany, who had fought on 
the front.  And one weekend deci
ded to put us all in cars and 
take us to Dachau, which is 
just outside of Munich, you know.  And he in
sisted that I ride with him in his car.  
 
And he tried to make a strong case for the fa
ct that he was a soldier on th e front, an 
officer on th e front, and not really knowing 
what was happening back home, as far as 
the Jewish problem.  I still -- I 
still have suspicions that if 
they wanted to find out what 
was happening, not only  to the Jews at home but
 to the Jews of the countries that were -- 
that they were occupy
ing during the war, they could eas
ily find out.  Even
 an -- even an 
artillery officer could find that out, what was 
really going on.  But he took us to the 
memorial.  And explained to us all -- the memori
al at D achau had just
 been built.  It was 
a very -- it was a very emotional trip.  I was 
the only Jew in that architecture group, but 
the group was -- only included two Germans.  
The rest were from, really, all o v er the 
world.  They  had students from everywhere 
that came to gether an
d had a chan ce to 
experience that very, very powerful visit.  
And they seemed to -- beginning to really 
understand what -- what
 kind of mass hysteria had taken pl
ace there, even though this 
was just ten years after the war.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: As far as getting back to the faith issue, 
there is a -- there is a -- a Jewish saying of 
attempting to heal the world, of acting in su
ch  a way, behaving th roughout your life in 
such a way, it's tikkun olam, which means to 
heal the world.  And in some small ways 
you're supposed -- ideally, it's 
to lead a life that would help 
to do that.  So I've gotten 
very involved in, at home, wo
rking with the homeless issue,
 which is prevalent in our 
town also, and in creating a sustainable syna
gogue that does a little b
it maybe to heal the 
environment.  And it was -- by the way, it was 
the first LEED certified synagogue in the 
world.  And hopefully -- and since then 
-- this was three years ago it was -- it w as 
certified.  And since then there have been many 
others that have also been certified.  So 
if any affect it had on me, it's  made me cons
cious of individual prejudices.  Wh en my  

wife and I talk to schools we try to get this
 across to kids as to picking on.  Right now 
there's a big thing all over the news about bu
llying and what -- what harm that can do.  
Bullying because of -- you're gay, or because 
they're Moslem or beca
use you're different 
from -- from the -- so th
e idea of differences and how 
we -- how we treat differences 
and how we only seem to gravitate to our own 
kind all the time needs to be addressed.  
 
And I think very slowly it is, 
but you know, it's very danger
ous what's happening in  this 
country right now becau
se when they say that the hysteria of Naziism was only because 
the Germans are so focused on 
the fuhrer, on a leader, that
 they will follo
w the leader 
over any precipice.  Some of the things we'r
e seeing now, some of the prejudices we see 
with the mo sque being proposed
 in New York  and what have
 you, it could happen here 
just as easily I think as -- as having anything
 happen in Germany in the 1930s.  So we're 
not -- we're not above that.  There are an awfu
l lot of -- well, I won't get into politics too 
much, but -- okay. 
 
Q: That's fine.  
 
A: Okay .  
 
Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add? 
 
A: I think that's -- 
 
Q: I think th at's great.  Thank you so mu ch.  
 
A: I think th at's fine.  Thank you very mu ch .  
 
Q: Thank you so  mu ch.  And th at's it.
