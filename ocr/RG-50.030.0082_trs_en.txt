A:
 W ell , li fe was prett y good. Uh both my parents had businesses.  
 

Q:
 W hat ki nd of busi ness?  
 

A:
 My mot her had a yard good
s  
store and my father was invo lved in several busi nesses. He 
uh suppl ied meat t o the Russi an.. .to t he P oli sh garrison at t he R ussi an border. Uh I 

remember he also di d som e ex porting of uh flax  and uh oil , uh meat, and apples. I 

remember particularly the apples because he used to rent orchards and would som eti mes 

take me to...when he went t o oversee the orchards, take me along and uh one of the 

im
pressi onable things that I remember is seeing the Russ ians play their harmonicas and 
uh dance in t he evening.  
 
Q:
 How...how did the Russ ians treat t he J ews of your vil lage?

A:
 W ell , they weren't weren't reall y R ussi ans. Uh they were the what t hey call  the W hit e 
R ussi ans, t he Belaruski s. Uh but my fami ly had a prett y good relations hip wit h them 

being in bus iness. Uh we had help i n the house that were genti les. Uh my brother's 

governess was a genti le  woman. I had a J ewish girl as my governess. Uh there were 

laundr
esses that were non -J ewish. I remember there were several help in t he house. S o uh 
the relations hip t hat m y parents had wit h the comm unit y genti les may  have been a li tt le 

bit  different and m aybe I had a different i mpressi on of it  all . Uh I remember visit ing with 

some of their acquaint ances in t he vil lages, surrounding vil lages, and uh I remember 

some good ti mes li ke horseback riding and playing with t heir chil dren.  
 
Q:
 S o li fe was was prett y good?  
 
A:
 Yes.  
 

Q:
 And you had a large J ewish comm unit y there?  
 

A:
 Uh for a small  town, it  was a prett y good si z ed J ewish comm unit y. Uh I remember it as 
being about t wenty-five hundred J ewish people in the town. Uh I don't know...som e of 

the things I've read about a town, there were anywhere between four thousand...between 

twenty-five hundred and four thous and J ews in t he town.  
 

Q:
 Did li fe revolve around uh J ewish observances and J ewish hol idays for you?  
 

A:
 Oh yes. Very much so. Uh I thi nk the whole J ewis h comm unit y was st eeped in J udaism . 
The holi days were of big im portance. Uh fami ly gatherings, the shabb
at
...e
 specially in our 
fami ly. Friday noon st arted shabb
at
. P
 reparati ons were ready. The table was laid and the 
candlesti cks were on the table and thehall ahs  were placed near the candlesti cks and there 

wa
s always Friday night di nner and uh shabb
at
, of c
 ourse, no cooking was done and uh 
fami li es gathered.  
 

Q:
 S o you had a very ti ght -knit  J ewish comm unit y in your town?  
 

A:
 Very much so. 
 

Q:
 W ere you aware then as a young chil d and when li fe was st il l good, were you aware of 
any hint  of anti -S emi ti sm?  
 

A:
 I reall y can't recall  any of it. If there was som e, I guess either I was sheltered from i t or 
just  as any other chil d i nvolved in her own thi ngs.  
 

 
Q:
 You had a close relations hip, as you said, wit h som e of the the maids t hat worked in your 
house or one maid in parti cular...  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

A:
 Yes...yes.  
 

Q:
 ...who was C athol ic?  
 

A:
 Yes.  
 

Q:
 I understand that uh that she had taken you to  a C athol ic church at one tim e?  
 

A:
 
Oh yes. I knew all  the rit uals. S he used to...actually my parents from what m y mot her tell s 
me, uh had forbidden her to  take us t o church, but s he wanted to go to church and uh, 
you know, in order to uh fulfill  her own duti es of taking care of us and my brother and I, 
actually different girl but  uh they would st eal off to church and take us wit h with t hem. 

And I learned the rit ual and it probably helped saved my li fe eventually.  
 

Q:
 How how do you mean helped save your l ife?  
 

A:
 W ell , when you go to church and you observe and you know, a chil d does what 
everybody else does, so i t came naturall y to kneel and to cross yourself if if necessary.  
 

Q:
 You found that you used thos e later on when you were fighti ng for survival?  
 

A:
 Uh one particular tim e, one particular tim e specificall y.  
 

Q:
 C an you tell m e about t hat t im e?  
 

A:
 Oh that was almost  toward the end of the war. Uh we were caught by the Germans and uh 
brought t o our own hometown and uh after we were all  housed in s ome barns wit h no 

foodand chil dren went out  to t o try to scrounge food and so di d I and one of the priests  

had given the chil dren food including me and uh everybody knelt  and thanked him  and 

did t he normal observances, and I knew how do to t hem properly too.  
 

Q:
 Uh let m e ask you a li tt le bit m ore about your fami ly li fe in P oland before the occupati on. 
Uh tell  me a li tt le bit about your father. I understand he was very acti ve in t he J ewish 

comm unit y.  
 
A:
 Uh he was acti ve in t he J ewish comm unit y. He was also u h very helpful t o som e of his uh 
genti le friends. Uh whenever they were in need of money to help them through a period, 
he did buy from them and uh I guess he must  have advanced them money. It...i t st ood us 

well  in i n our escaping from the ghett o. It probably also cost m y brother's li fe.  
 

Q:
 How do you mean?  
 

A:
 W ell , my brother was uh l eft with a fami ly to uh hi de him  and we are not s ure ex actl y 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

what t ranspi red but uh he was turned over to the Germans. The story we got i s that uh t his 
particular gentl eman's mot her-
in
-law was mad at hi m and uh told t he Germans t hat he 
was hi ding a J ewish chil d. W hether that was the ex act st ory or not, I don't know. But uh, 

you know, we remembered the good thi ngs much quicker than the bad ones, and along 

the way when we escap ed from our ghett o to another ghett o, uh we were helped by 

genti le friends of my father's.  
 

Q:
 Uh how old...how old was your brother's name?  
 

A:
 My brother's name was S hlom o . 
 
Q:
 
How old was S hlom o when he was ki ll ed?  
 
A:
 Uh three years younger than I, so i n 1942 I guess he was about eight.  
 

Q:
 Did your fami ly ever find out  any of the facts or any of the rumors or or any information 
invol ving him  being turned over?  Did he go to a concentrati on camp?  Did you ever find 

out what actually happ ened?  
 

A:
 Oh no. None of the people in our hometown went t o a concentrati on camp. In uh our part 
of P oland uh there were no concentrati on camps. There was no i ndust ry. There was no 

need for labor and uh what t hey basicall y did i s they gathered the J ews an d shot  them. 

They eli mi nated everybody by the bullet and som eti mes they'll ...som e horror stories were 
they left bodi es on t op of li ve people and they just  suffocated. Uh they also...a  few people 
that I know that had managed to crawl out from under these d ead bodies at ni ght and get 

away.
 
 

Q:
 S o the the Naz is woul d do a round -up?  
 

A:
 Do a round-up and uh shoot  the people.  
 

Q:
 
Did your fami ly find out  what happened to t he fami ly who who shelt ered your brother?  
 

A:
 Uh my mot her went back after the war but uh (sigh) it 's di fficult t o get t he story straight. 
My brother's governess di d go int o town im mediately uh to find out  what happened to 

him  and the only thi ng she would t ell  my mot her when she came back is t hat she was sure 
he was shot . W hen we escaped from t he ghett o and uh on the way, we stopp ed at at her 
house and uh she hid us ...I don't remember for how long, whether it  was hours or 

overnight and she went i nto t own to find out  what happened to hi m and uh she tol d it  was 

not safe for her to keep us becauseeverybody had...knew the connecti on and she had just  

come from town inqui ring about hi m.  
 
Q:
 I know that you were a small  chil d at t hat t im e. You must  have som e im pressi ons of what 
it  was li ke. Uh how do you thi nk that your mother was able to hear this and  sti ll  go on in 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
5
 
 
her own fight for survival for herself and for you and for the fami ly?  How...how did...  
 
A:
 Uh I know from...from my own feeli ngs, the the desire to l ive and to protect som eone is 
great and I thi nk at t hat poi nt i t was a matt er of protecti n g me and gett ing me through it  

that kept her going. 
 
 

Q:
 Did it  sharpen the wil l t o li ve, knowing that that death could be so i mm inent?  
 

A:
 I thi nk the wil l t o li ve is s omething that does not  need to be sharpened. I thi nk it 's there all  
the tim e and uh I t hink what happens i s is  they...the closer one feels t hat upon one's self, 

the the stronger the fight i s. I've watched friends that had cancer and passed away and 
theirwill  to l ive was so s trong that uh one does not  beli eve that death i s around the 
corner. 
 

Q:
 How did i t affect you and your own struggle as a lit tl e girl at that ti me?  
 

A:
 I don't even know how to answer that. How it affected me?  You just  do the nex t t hing.  
 

Q:
 S o do you thi nk that...of course, looki ng back because it would be hard to recall ex actl y 
wha
t happened, but do you thi nk that you you had to di stance yourself or tuck it away in a 
part of your mind unt il  you could deal wit h it  and and jus t t ake the nex t st ep?  
 

A:
 I don't even thi nk one thi nks. I thi nk or at l east I felt  that uh when d anger is there you try 
to t o st ay...st ay ali ve, stay out of it . I know one particular circumst ance where I lost  my 

mot her, got separated in the forest. Di dn't know where I was, nobody was there. All I 

could hear was the Germans call ing and shoot ing, and at  that point ...  
 

Q:
 
C all ing and shoot ing?  
 

A:
 C all ing. Uh they knew people were around there. W e were in t he partisans at t hat t im e 
already and they were call ing out give yourself up and you will  survive, and, of course, 

spraying bull ets over the the area, and I remember going out t o the clearing. I forget...i t's 

bett er to get shot  than be lost  in t he forest, and going out t o the area and watching the 

bull ets hi t t he dirt i n front of me. It sort of makes a lit tl e puff when it  hit s the dirt. Then I 

heard my m other call ing me. It di dn't t ake me (laughter) a spl it  second to t urn away and 

run, and that I remember very clearly.  
 

Q:
 W hen you thought about that decisi on, uh being lost  and alone in the forest or givi ng 
yourself up to be shot ...  
 

A:
 No, not givi ng mys elf up. S ooner be shot  than give myself up.  
 
Q:
 S o you were going to wil li ngly walk i nto...  
 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
6
 
 
A:
 Into a bullet...yes.  
 
Q:
 And...and why?  W hy...  
 

A:
 Uh you have to understand that at t hat poi nt we were very much aware of what Germans 
did t o J ews and even th ough at t hat poi nt t here were no J ews ali ve that we knew of in any 

of the surrounding towns, knowing that I'm J ewish and knowing what await ed me, don't 

you thi nk it 's easier to t ake a bull et at random t han to have som ebody point  a gun between 

your eyes?  
 

Q:  Your fami ly...you had a father and mot her and a brother before the occupati on and uh...  
 
A:
 There were uncles and aunts and grandparents...  
 

Q:
 An ex tended fami ly....  
 

A:
 S ure.  
 

Q:
 Let m e go back chronologicall y a li tt le bit i n ti me and talk about how th ere became an 
awareness i n your comm unit y and in your fami ly that the occupati on was coming. Not 

everybody beli eved it , is t hat correct?  
 

A:
 Uh you mean the German occupati on?  W ell , once uh the Germans st arted to fight t he 
P oles, once they declared war on P oland, we knew that t he Germans would be comi ng. 

Uh you mus t understand that we were already occupied by the Russ ian forces. P oland was 

divi ded and it  wasn't a matt er of, you know, wil l t hey come. It was a questi on of when 

they will  come, how quickly they will  come. 
 

Q:
 
Did your comm unit y...the J ews in your comm unit y...you talked about t oward the end 
knowing at t hat poi nt what t hey did t o J ews, but i n the beginni ng you didn't reall y know?  
 

A:
 S tories filt ered down. Uh st ories fil tered down about t he fact t hat uh t he J ews in Germany 
were being taken out of their homes. Uh J ews from P oland had run away uh because the 

Germans were comi ng in and occupying. Uh some of them who came returned back 

because the condit ions u nder the R ussi ans were so bad too. Uh my fa mi ly especially since 

we were call ed bourgeois (ph), rich J ews or rich people period, uh we were packed and 
wait ing to be taken to S iberia. That's what t hey did wit h with t he rich people, uh resett li ng 
them. P robably would have been a blessing in di sguise.  
 

Q:
 S o you were a comm unit y knowing that your fate lay eit her in the hands of the Germans 
or the Russ ians, and at t hat poi nt, di d...was there an awareness of what would be bett er or 

what would be worse, what your...?  
 

A:
 There was an awareness of oppressi on under the Germans, but  I don't t hink anybody uh 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
7
 
 
thought of being just  shot  to death, being eli mi nated or wiped off the face of the earth. I 
don't t hink...as a chil d, ofcourse, I didn't t hink about it , but I don't t hink t he general 

comm unit y was prepared for the type of holocaust t hat t hat happened and remember 

somethi ng else...all  that did not  start unt il  a li tt le later. The concentrati on camps.. .I mean 

we had no knowledge of concentrati on camps at t hat poi nt.  
 

Q:
 But t here was a ghett oiz ati on (ph) pro cess?  
 

A:
 Ghett oiz ati on process was not  im mediately. That was oh several m onths  later. Uh the 
Germans came in in I thi nk J uly and I know it was sum mer. And the ghett o was not  

organiz ing...  
 

Q:
 W hat year do you thi nk that was?  
 

A:
 No. That was 1941, and the ghett o did not  get establi shedunti l t he winterti me, so there 
we
re several m onths , maybe not...s ix  mont hs m aybe, five months.  
 

Q:
 In the tim e between the tim e the Germans came in and occupied and the actual 
ghett oiz ati on, what was the transformation t hat took pl ace in your comm unit y?  
 

A:
 W ell , everybody became aware of the fact t hat t he J ews were not t reated well . Uh there 
were incidents of beati ngs. Uh the nex t t hing was the edict to wear the the yell ow star. No 

J ew was to u h venture out wit hout t he yell o w star. If you were  caught, t hey would get 
beaten. I don't recall  but I thi nk there were even a few inst ances where people were shot , 
J ewish people were shot . One of the thi ngs that st ands out  in m y mi nd is uh Ru ssi an 

prisoners of war that were driven thr ough the town and they were in j ust t erribl e 

condit ion, uh wit hout s hoes, wit hout proper clot hing, hungry, looki ng dil apidated and 

drawn and went begging, of course, for food and water and if somebody att empt ed to give 

them...or couldn't hand it t o them, t hrow toward them, uh anythi ng, any food and if they 

caught i t or even if they didn't, t he Germans beat t hem and even shot  several people if 

they lunged toward the crowd to receive some food, they shot  them, and that was I thi nk 

the first awareness of the brutali ty of those people.  
Q:
 W as there a systemati c att empt  to set apart and segregate and identify the J ews?  
 

A:
 Uh yes. If a J ew had to wear the yell ow star, he was set aside...he was set apart from the 
comm unit y. He was poi nted to. To me it m eans being point ed to s omeone, there is a J ew. 
Uh pr
obably there must  have been an accounti ng. Uh I recall  quit e early where som e of 
the...of our possessions  were taken, uh valuables. The Germans uh had...I guess t here was 
some sort of an organiz ati on that was uh fo rmed from t he J ews or appoint ed as a leader of 

the J ews and the the int ermediary between the German comm and and the J ewish 

comm unit y where the J ewish comm unit y was tax ed because I remember having to give 

up som e valuables to h elp wit h the wa r effort.  
 

Q:
 S o the J ewish comm unit y was organiz ed as a comm unit y and in t hat way was uh t here 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
8
 
 
was a liaison t o the Germans. Is that how it  worked?  
 
A:
 No. The J ewish comm unit y was always organiz ed. The J ewish comm unit y has always 
had it s own organiz ati on  where if help was needed uh even to t he point  of sort of li ke a 

ba
nking system, gmi lut h chesed, 
where if someone uh found themself in di re need and 
needed money to t o ti de him  over, he could go to t he J ewish comm unit y and get som e of 

it . Uh that  
establi shment had ex ist ed and uh I don't recall  whether the same person was 
head of the J ewish comm unit y when the Germans came in or whether som ebody else was 

appoint ed, but t here was a liaison.  
 

Q:
 Do you remember when the edict went out  that all  J ews h ad to wear stars?  
 

A:
 I don't remember ex actl y when but wit hin a short period afterwards, maybe withi n a 
mont h or six  weeks.  
 

Q:
 Do you remember what i t was li ke wearing the star?  
 

A:
 Very much, because that was my first feeli ng of uh being singled out and  point ed to. All  
of
 a sudden I was less, you know...livi ng in a fami ly that was qui te comfortably uh 
sit uated financially and uh feeli ng...being the upper crust to becomi ng the the lower crust. 

All of a sudden wearing the J ewish st ar made me less of a...of  an im portant person t han I 

wa
s before. 
 
 
Q:
 Did your fell ow vill agers react i n that manner to you?  
 
A:
 Uh yes. R emember it i t wasn't reall y that sm all  a vil lage. There were probably about ni ne 
thous and, ten thousand inhabitants t otal, so i f there were one -thi rd of them J ewish, t wo  

thi rds were not and in a comm unit y li ke that, of course, there are all  kinds . I remember 

very much being spi t at. I remember having to get off the sidewalk when I walked on the 

sidewalk and a non
-J ew was approaching. P art of the  the prescribed new behavior was 
that one
 had to accomm odate the non -J ewish person.  
 

Q:
 S o before thi s process, you didn't feel anti -S emi ti sm?  
 

A:
 Not as such because being withi n the fami ly and the school, uh you know, if I ventured 
out i nto t he non -J ewis h comm unit y, it  was normall y my parents' acquaint ances. Uh wit h 
my parents having busi nesses and especially my mot her had probably the largest yard  
good
s  
store in t he area, there were always non -J ewish people comi ng and going and the 
store was uh i n front of the house. It was sort of connected. 
 

Q:
 And now thi ngs were very different, now that you were set apart and identified as a J ew?  
 
A:
 Uh it s tarted actually when the Russi ans came in, because all  of a sudden we were 
identified as bourgeois. The store was closed. Our circumst ances were quit e different, so  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
9
 
 
it  was sort of a degrading of circumst ances st arting with t he R ussi an occupati on, and that 
proceeded int o the German occupati on, the condit ions constantly gett ing worse.  
 

Q:
 Let m e ask about so me of the  reli gious and cult ural observances that were comm on in 
y
our town and how you kept t hem under the occupati on. Now your father was a Zioni st, 
correct?   
 

A:
 Yes.  
 

Q:
 And how did he practi ce or promot e that Zioni sm?  
 
A:
 I know that I was taught Hebrew at an early age. I know I spoke fluent Hebrew and 
remembered enough of it t hat after li berati on, uh I met up with Isra...actually when we 
came across the border into Italy, we met the Hebrew brigade and uh I had no difficulty 

comm unicati ng.  
 

Q:
 W ere any other ways in whi ch your father observed Zioni st t eachings and...?  
 

A:
 W ell , I thi nk probably he always contribut ed to t he J ewish comm unit y and uh to Israel. I 
remember the the lit tl e box , tz edoka, the discussi ons about Israel i n the house. Uh some 

cousi n s had uh gone to what was call ed a kibbut z , preparing to go to Israel, uh ki nd of 

gett ing traini ng, mos tl y agricult ural t raini ng and li ving in communi ti es. Uh I remember 

the hall utz  (ph) movement, patriot ic songs, uh l earning about s ome of the the heroes .  
 

Q:
 
And there were also J ewish S ocialist s.  
 

A:
 I'm sure there were. I know that I had a cousi n who had uh gone to R ussi a uh in t he 
revolut ionary period. W e never heard from him . All I did was see pictures of him. I never 

actually knew him, but  that was my uh father's si ster's son.  
 

Q:
 W as it  hard to maintain J ewish observances after the Germans came and how did you do 
that specificall y?  
 

A:
 Uh much of it...t he synagogues ceased to ex ist  as they did before. Uh much of it was in 
the house. I remember a  ____ seder. I also remember wall  to wall  beds and that the table 

wa
s set up and everybody sat on the beds, because that was in t he ghett o, probably the the 
last sederin ghett o. And uh I remember that i t was conducted.  
 

Q:
 W hat do you rem ember about t hat seder?  
 

A:
 P robably for the first t im e in m y li fe, I observed the baking of the matz oh and it  was done 
at ni ght i n hidi ng. You know, couldn't remember before now that...you kind of jogged my 
memory to i t. I remember the baking of thematz oh at one of the houses where they 
uh...the ba
king was set up and I remember everythi ng being blacked out.  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

Q:
 Now you were in hi ding at t his t im e?  
 

A:
 No. That was in t he ghett o.  
 

Q:
 
OK.
 
 

A:
 I'm t alki ng about during the ghett o.  
 

Q:
 You had to hi de t he fact t hat you were observing passover?  
 
A:
 The fact...yes, that m atz oh was being baked for passover.  
 
Q:
 S o it  had been...the the observance of J ewish hol idays had been outl awed at t hat poi nt?  
 

A:
 I guess. I don't know why else it had to be done at ni gh t and in hidi ng.  
 

Q:
 And shabbot?  
 

A:
 S habbot was a a normal observance. Nobody worked on shabbot. If any J ew worked on 
shabbot, he was look ed down upon and point ed to by the rest of the comm unit y.  
 

Q:
 W ere you all owed to obs erve shabbot or was that also s omething that had to be done in 
hidi ng?  
 

A:
 I reall y don't know. I am sure that the Germans t ook all  the people to work. Uh a certain 
segment of the populati on from t he ghett o was taken to work eit her cleaning or doing 

whatever the Germans needed done...laundry or uh som e of them were shoemakers or uh 

tailors. Those fared a li tt le bett er because they were needed.  
 

Q:
 Going back to t hat passover sederfor a mi nute, uh do you remember what i t m eant t o you 
as a chil d observing how life had changed from one passover to t he other?  How it ...what 

did i t m ean to you that that J ews were gathered, not enough to eat, i n a crowded si tuation 

and and trying to m aint ain t hat t hat observance?  
 

A:
 I'm not  quit e sure, I'll  tell you the truth. I just ...you know, it's a memory of what t he seder 
was li ke, a memory of the fact t hat uh you were not wit h just  fami ly. Actually not wit h 

fami ly, only the people that l ived in the house. S ome were fami ly, som e not. Uh it  was 

more what I remember is the fact t hat i t was di fferent.  
 

Q:
 W ould you...do you thi nk that it  had special meaning then or only when you look back on 
it?
 
 

A:
 I thi nk at t his po int  only when I look back at i t. It was...i t was so l ong ago I don't reall y 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

remember what m y feeli ngs were. J ust t he fact t hat t hey were strange. It wasn't t he way it  
used 
to be. 
 

Q:
 W hat else did you remember how long a period of ti me, from the beginni ng of the 
ghett oiz ati on to t o that ti me?  
 

A:
 Uh the ghett o st arted in t he winterti me and it  was sum mer. I know it was after S hav uot 
and it  was around  May that the ghett o was li quidated, so I would say probably six  

mont hs.  
 

Q:
 OK. S o thi s was a process t hat t ook si x  mont hs. W hat happened in t hat period of ti me?  
How was twenty-five thous and people or three thous and people...  
 

A:
 Twenty-five hundred.  
 

Q:
 Twenty-five hundred...ex cuse me...li quidated?  
 

A:
 W ell , you...we had certain sm all  groups that were shot . Uh I remember stories that uh 
people were made to di g their own graves. Uh in front of the cemetery, there was a big 

pit .. .I guess a sand pit . I just  remember there was a pit and from what I heard that i s where 

the majority of the people were shot . Uh I know...I remember hearing that som e of the 

people...uh J ews had to t o throw dirt or sand or whatever over the bodies. Uh tho se 

people had been at t he edge of that pi t and had come back. Uh there were small  groups 
that were kil led and then there were what t hey call ed uh reducing the numbers, I guess.  
 
Q:
 W hat di d that...what di d that mean?  
 

A:
 They had taken away the the the uh the less able and uh the smallest and uh shot  them. It 
sort of
 was a a process t hat t hey went t hrough by eli mi nati ng people and making the 
ghett o sm all er, easier to control.  
 

Q:
 How were J ews identi fied in t he various phases to b e ex ecuted?  
 

A:
 I thi nk i t was who was avail able, who they could get hol d of and uh normally the 
strongest ones were the ones that survived because they could us e them. The Germans uh 

needed som e people to do their chores and kept up...kept out t he the most  able. Uh every 
ti me that t he people in the ghett o became aware that uh there was going to be some uh 
some cleaning out, t hat t hey were going to t o take som e of the people away, whoever 

could hi d and if one was in h idi ng, if they didn't find t hem, m anaged to s urvive. Actually 

we 
survived because we were in hi ding...hidi ng uh at t he ti me when the final phase of the 
ghett o was li quidated.  
 
Q:
 W hen...approaching the final phase, what was the the mentalit y?  W as there an awareness 
that eventually your number would be up, that eventual ly in not  too l ong a period of ti me 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
12
 
 
that that it  would be your turn to be eli mi nated and and was there fear?  W as there 
uh...was there an awareness t hat you had to get out ?  W hat was the mentali ty li ke at t he 

ti me?  
 

A:
 W ell , of course there was awareness and  there was no pl ace to go. Uh a few people did 
mana
ge to get out  and uh the reprisals were very very high and that probably kept ot her 
people from from leaving if they could get out , because the first ones that would uh be 

usedin t he reprisal would be thefami ly. I guess i t's very difficult for a person to to save 

his l
ife knowing that his  fami ly is going to t o pay for it .  
 

Q:
 W ere you scared?  You were a li tt le girl at the tim e. How much of thi s were you...did you 
know and and and how did you deal wit h it ?  W ere you frightened?  
 

A:
 Of course. Of course. Uh it's fear but it 's almost  an accepted fear at t hat poi nt. You do 
thi ngs because you have to do t hem. I remember incidents where...I'd be jum ping the gun. 

W e escaped from one ghett o and we were in another ghett o and we knew that t here was 

going to be a reducti on again and a cousi n had a studi o and the Germans had tol d him  that 

that night he was to s pend at hi s st udio and he took m e along with hi m and I wasn't 

all owed to walk wit h him . I had to foll ow at a d ist ance, and he hid m e and uh we went up 

to t he att ic of the house and watched what was going on.  
 

Q:
 W hat was going on?  
 
A:
 W ell , we saw the J ews being gathered int o one open field. W e watched them being 
separated, a grouphere, a groupthere, ex ami ning t heir papers and som e taken away and 
some returned back to t he houses.  
 

Q:
 W hat happened to t he ones that were taken away?  
 

A:
 They were shot .  
 

Q:
 Did you see thi s happen?  
 

A:
 No. I don't know whether he did or not. He survived, by the way.  
 

Q:
 Your cousi n ?  
 

A:
 Yes. He survived. He was an ex cell ent phot ographer, and the German made...the 
Germans m ade full  use of his uh talents.  
 

Q:
 As people were being reduced or eli mi nated in your ghett o, first of all , did you know 
some of the people and when did i t st art to encroach on the people that you knew, your 
neighbors, the...?  
 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
13
 
 
A:
 Actually nobody from my fami ly uh was elim inated in i n the reducti on of the ghett o. 
Everybody li ved to t he final li quidation.  
 
Q:
 Let m e ask you about when the decisi on was made by your fami ly to go int o hidi ng?  
 

A:
 It wasn't a matt er of decisi on. The ghett o was surrounded. W ord had it  that uh som ethi ng 
was going to happen. Nobody ever knew how much of what would happen, and when that 

was announced uh my fami ly had buil t a double wall  in a  uh...it  was a warehouse at one 

ti
me. Of course, it  was used for quarters at t hat poi nt. Our house som ehow was in t he 
ghett o. Uh the ghett o was around the synagogue courtyards because that was the 

concentrati on of J ews and along the street so t hat i t had s ome sort of divi sion, divi ding 
li ne, and the houses on our side of the street, all of them had uh enclosed courtyards to the 
street, so i t was easy to close off that particular part, so in t he warehouse uh there was a 

double wall .  
 

Q:
 Now when you say a do uble wall , how big a space do you mean?  
 

A:
 How big a space...probably just  a matter of a couple of...I'd say about t wo and a half, three 
feet wide. 
 

Q:
 And your fami ly hid t here?  
 

A:
 Yes. Not j ust m y fami ly...quit e a number of people. W hoever could get i n . It wasn't a 
matter of...when that was announced and when the Germans st arted to knock on the door, 

it 's it 's who could m ake it , and at a certain poi nt, t he door was closed and that was it .  
 

Q:
 S o one day the Germans came and knocked on the door and your  fami ly...?  
 

A:
 
Uh one morning, word had it  that som ethi ng was happening. I reall y can't recall  whether 
we went i n there. S ometim es we would sl eep in t here. If there was any kind of word that 

somethi ng was going to happen, we would not s pend the night i n t he house but i n thi s 

hidi ng place.  
 

Q:
 How long did you li ve or hide in t his hi ding place?  
 

A:
 At that particular tim e, I thi nk it  was about a week.  
 

Q:
 You spent a week.  
 

A:
 
About a week. 
 

Q:
 
And how many other people were there?  
 

A:
 I'm aware of my mot h er and myself and my brother, my grandmot her and som e other 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
14
 
 
people. J ust ho w many other people, I don't know because it seemed like whenever 
somebody went out , they just  didn't return. If somebody went out  to i nvesti gate...uh I 

know that m y grandmot her was  caught and of course she would not  tell. S he just  said she 

wa
s the only one and she hid and she would not poi nt out  as to where we were.  
 

Q:
 How do you remember that your grandmot her was caught?  
 

A:
 Uh I remember because that...i t was a very traumatic ti me. Parti cularly remember my 
mot her trying to t o reach for her and trying to protect us at t he same ti me.  
 

Q:
 Now your mother was in t his hi ding place?  
 

A:
 Yes.  
 

A:
 And you grandmot her went out  and and encountered German sol diers?  
 

A:
 My...no. W hat happened was is  uh we could hear quite a bit  with what was going on. W e 
c
ouldn't see. There was a lot of shooti ng going on and uh then it became quiet. W e did 
not have any more bread or water and how long can you st ay in a hiding place. Also we 

could hear voices  
and we could hear the discussi on of the the genti les. Everybody came to 
loot  and I  guess our house in parti cular. (Laughter) And uh I remember at som e point  I 

guess i t was felt  that uh it 's ti me to to get out  and and go. Uh one of the dangers was 

that...
I don't recall  ex actl y what happened but i t seemed to me that m y mot her overheard 
somebody saying that uh everythi ng is, you know, is...everybody's gone from here and it 's 

ti me to to occupy the house, to t ake the house. Then it  would be very difficult t o g et out . 

And the decisi on, I guess, was made to t ry to get out  and also t here was more than one 

hidi ng place in a house. Normally there were several so what we tried to do i s get out  

from t hat one and get i nto t he house. There was another hidi ng place in a pantry under the 

ground...under the floors and we were going there and I don't recall  whether my 

grandmot her was first or last but  I know...I remember hearing her.  
 

Q:
 Hearing her as she encountered Germans...?  
 

A:
 As she encountered...not j ust t he Germans . Uh we li ved in a sit uati on where it  wasn't j ust 
the Germans t hat were against  us. The P oles in t he comm unit y, the the genti les in t he 

comm unit y were against  us t oo. I'm not  going to say all  of them. I wouldn't be ali ve today 
if it  were all  of them, but  a  great num ber were and uh our part of the country was a very 
poor 
part of the country and I guess t he the looti ng is what uh what appealed to a lot  of 
the people, being able to uh to accumul ate somebody...you know, take over somebody 

else's wealt h and even  though by the tim e we came into t he ghett o a lot  of it was st ripped, 

but i
t was st il l som e thi ngs. W hen you talk about a comm unit y where people didn't even 
have shoes...uh m y husband st il l ki ds m e about I come from a small  town where you walk 
barefoot. Yo
u only put on your shoes when you came to the market pl ace.  
 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

Q:
 Your grandmot her left the hidi ng place, and then you knew somethi ng happened. You'd 
heard... 
 
A:
 W e knew that t he...that she was caught. W hether it  was Germans or whether genti les, we 
were..
.I I don't know, but I know that she was caught because she was carried away. S he 
was pul led away, and she was beaten and she said I don't know. I was by myself. That I 

remember very clearly.  
 

Q:
 And do you remember being with your mother at t he ti me and. ..?  
 

A:
 My mot her was with  us. S ee what happened was is  whenever somethi ng li ke thi s 
happened, the women and chil dren were the ones that were put i nto hi ding and the men, 

the big protectors were were left out . There was jus t so m uch space to hi de.  
 

Q:
 W here was your father at t his t im e?  
 

A:
 By then he was no l onger ali ve.  
 

Q:
 W as he kil led in the Holocaust?  W as he taken away or eli mi nated?  
 

A:
 I don't even remember the circumst ances. I just  know he was...he was not  with us .  
 

Q:
 But at one point  you became aware that your fami ly...?  
 

A:
 Uh the...(sigh)...I don't know how to ex plain it  to you. W hen som ethi ng li ke thi s happens, 
in t he first pl ace you're not  reall y sure of what t he circumst ances were. It's not ...it 's  not  a 

normal occurrence. All I know is t hat t he fami ly became small er. At t hat poi nt frankly it 's 

it 's jus t a nightm are. That parti cular incident i s a nightm are. The thi ngs that I remember is 

even when we were running out from t he second hidi ng place, crawling over bodies, the 

thi ngs that st and ou t i n my mi nd is that we crossed the river, which was one of the 

boundaries of the ghett o, after crawling over bodies and hidi ng in t he shadows and uh 

encountering two men wit h rifles, and my mot her had som e valuables on her and she said 

look, I I can make 
you rich. P ut  out  your hands and I'll  give it all t o you, and they did. 
They slung their rifles over their shoulder, and withi n the period of ti me that t hey put 

away their possess...our possessions I shoul d say, not t heir possessi ons, uh we managed to 

escape so i t was known that we were som eplace around and I don't know if they 
recogniz ed my mot her. They could easil y figure out where we were going to, who the 
friends were and which particular vill age we would go to. I remember hiding uh in a 

bathhous e in a 
nearby vil lage and I remember a man comi ng and telli ng us t hat 
every...they know that you're sti ll  ali ve and that you're around here som eplace. You'd 

bett er run. You bett er hide. That was after my mot her had left m y brother wit h my father's 

very good friend to hi de him . S he took m e to t his parti cular man's si ster, and by the tim e 
we got t here...remember we can only do it  at ni ght, not  during the dayti me...and don't ask 
me whether it  was the same night or the nex t ni ght. Uh by the tim e she brought m e there,  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
16
 
 
uh thi s man tol d my mot her that he had just  come back and noti ced that my father 
was...m y...sorry...my brother was caught by the Germans and that we bett er run from t his 

vil lage because we're not s afe here.  
 

Q:
 S o at t his po int , it  was jus t you and your mot her?  
 

A:
 It was jus t m y mot her and I.  
 

Q:
 And where did you run to?  
 

A:
 W ell , the nex t pl ace...well , we hid. I remember hiding in...t he wheat grows prett y high in 
our part of the country and I remember hiding in t he wheat, i n the field, and I remember 

genti les passi ng, farmers passi ng and talking about what was happening in t own, the fact 

that all  the J ews were were kil led. They reall y did a clean -up job. Uh at ni ght we managed 

to get over to m y brother's governess' house and we must  have hid t he night s omeplace 

nearby because probably the nex t ni ght we got news that m y brother was no l onger ali ve 

and ventured further.  
 

Q:
 S o that night before you had seen your brother?  
 

A:
 Yes. W e were all  three of us together unti l m y mot her left me in t his bath house a nd took 
my brother to place him  int o hidi ng. I guess she figured she'll  place him  and place me 

someplace safe and then she'll  fend for herself. Unfortunately, it  didn't work out t hat way.  
 

Q:
 S o you were left alone for a ti me.  
 

A:
 I was...yes. Actually no ...there were two other chil dren that som ehow managed to t o get 
out wit h us.  
 

Q:
 How old were you then?  
 

A:
 It's easy to figure out. It was 1942. The win...the...not...not qui te twelve. Eleven years old.  
 

Q:
 W hen your mother left you...  
 

A:
 W ait  a mi nute . It was 1943, so I was twelve years old.  
 

Q:
 W hen you were left alone for that period of ti me, what was your reacti on?  W ere you...did 
you feel t hat you were strong?  W ere you especially frightened do you remember?  
 

A:
 J ust wait ing and and hoping my mot her comes back.  
 
Q:
 W ere you not s ure that that would happen?  
 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

A:
 I don't t hink I was sure of anythi ng. I thi nk one becomes numb. You...you don't feel a 
thi ng. You just ...you jus t t ake it  as it  comes.  
 
Q:
 S o from t here after your mother and you received this  news about your brother, where did 
you go nex t?  
 

A:
 Nex t we went t o another genti le fami ly. Again m y mot her started to choose very, very 
carefully as to where to go, who she would thi nk would be the the least uh bell igerent and 

we went t o thi s woman's hous e. Uh she was a widow and my father had helped her out 

greatl y when her husband passed away and my mot her felt  that uh that was a good place 

to go, and uh when we got t here uh she wasn't hom e. Her daughter was hom e and her 
daughter must  have been just  abou t a couple of years older than I and uh the daughter 
knew us very well  too, and she hid us  and uh I remember the the center of the 

house...mos t of the houses had li ke a fireplace, an oven. Everybody had to bake bread. It 

was li ke an oven and to keep warm. It was bui lt  out of bricks and it  had sort of li ke a uh a 

a level area. A lot of the uh farmers would s leep there in t he winterti me because the oven 

would be heated up, so she put us  there and normally there was som e sort of a curtain that 

was drawn across 
it , so t hat's where she put us and that's where we stayed and uh the 
mot her came back and as in m any vil lages, the big pasti me was to get t ogether and to t alk 

and uh we were up there and thi s woman crawled up and sat down right i n front of the 

curtain and
 
talked to t he people that were sit ti ng on benches and they were discussi ng 
about what happened in t he town.  
 
Q:
 And she didn't know you were in t here?  
 
A:
 Oh, she knew we were there because when she came home her daughter had informed her 
that uh we had come and she put us ...where she put us to hi de us.  
 

Q:
 How long did you st ay there?  
 

A:
 W e stayed there probably a couple of nights, u nti l t hings qui eted down because uh thi s 
woman had sent a son...she had two sons and a daughter and we actually saw her aft er the 

war too. Uh we know she left P oland because my mot her corresponded with her and after 

a while the letters jus t came back. Uh she was actually of French ex tracti on. S he married 

her husband who was P oli sh and was li ving there, and she had talked abou t going back to 

her people anyway. S o I suppose she must  have gone back, but what she did was is  she uh 
sent us by horse and wagon, giv...givi ng us her clot hing, her documents, her daughter's 
documents, and sent her son wit h us t o take us t o another vil lage. Uh actually she scouted. 

Uh my mot her told her who she wanted...where...where the nex t st op could be for us and 

she had gott en in t ouch with t hosepeople. She went over there and jus t spok e and she 

says yes, it 's safe.  
 
Q:
 W hat would have happened to he r if it  had been found out t hat she did all  that to hi de you 
and save your life?  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
18
 
 
 
A:
 Our li ves and hers would have been ended.  
 

Q:
 W hy do you thi nk she she did t hat, t hat she risked her life...?  
 

A:
 S he was...she was a righteous person. She was a good per son. That's why I said that thank 
God that t here are som e people who did not  side wit h the Germans and who had a 

conscious and uh who had love of humanity and and wanted to help people.  
 

Q:
 W ere those people...those righteous people...were they ex traordina ry?  W ere they few?  Uh 
how did you know or did you know who would would would put t heir own li ves on t he 
li ne to help you?  
 
A:
 You didn't know. You didn't know. It was a matt er of I guess l uck.  
 

Q:
 S o these were people that you had known before...  
 

A:
 Oh ye
s.
 
 

Q:
 ...but one may turn you in and the other may save your life?  
 

A:
 C orrect.  
 
Q:
 You said t hat your mother chosevery carefully. Do you thi nk she sensed about t his on e 
woman that that thi s would be...?  
 
A:
 W ell , the circumst ances were such that she figured if anybody had any kind of a debt t o 
pay and they were...and they were good, they would do it , if they would turn us in. At t hat 

point  thi s parti cular woman had nothi ng to gain by turning us i n. Uh the nex t fami ly...  
 

Q:
 But she had a lot  to l ooseby helpi ng you?  
 

A:
 S he had a lot  to l oose. It was jus t t hat uh I remember her tell ing my mot her that uh m y 
father had come to her aid when she thought t hat l ife was over for her and she'll  do 

anythi ng she can to help us out .  
 
Q:
 There was a big reali z ati on o f informers. There were a lot  of informi ng going on which 
would help?  
 
A:
 Quite a bit . The Germans rewarded the informants.  
 

Q:
 How did t hey do that?  
 

A:
 There was an incenti ve. W ell  uh one of the thi ngs is  uh whatever the possessions t hat 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
19
 
 
remained from t he J ews, they would share in t hose, uh the houses. They...the property.  
 
Q:
 S o if you turned in a J ewish fami ly, you mi ght st and to gain som e of their wealt h?  
 

A:
 Definitely. Definitely.  
 

Q:
 It was a direct benefit?  
 

A:
 Direct benefit.  
 

Q:
 W ere you surpri sed that som e people took the incenti ve or or sided wit h the Germans, 
people you had known before the war?  
 

A:
 You know, there is no  surprise. In the first pl ace, the age that I was at, I don't t hink I knew 
enough about hum an nature to reall y reali z e any o f it. I thi nk I was more aware of what 

was happening, what i t t ook to s urvive, than what people would do. I thi nk a lot  of it...you  

know, it's the same as here. You see people who have very li tt le and yet t hey go out and 

help t he more needy and you see peo ple who are very well  off and they look t he other 

way. I thi nk it 's the same thing with t hen. It...i t was more as to h ow people perceived 

themselves. Uh som eti mes the most reli gious were the ones that uh t hat probably would 

would turn on someone quicker an d then there were som e that uh truly beli eved in i n 

saving a human life.
 
 
Q:
 Because you're not necessaril y talking about helping som ebody in need. You're talking 
about reall y a tremendous personal sacrifice to t o help som eone.  
 
A:
 W ell , it 's riski ng your li fe. Anybody...anybody saving a J ew, coll aborati ng with a J ew uh 
stood  to l oosehis l ife. If not his l ife at l east hi s healt h because a good si z ed beati ng can 

leave one maimed, uh or worse.  
 

Q:
 W hat ki nd of brutali ty during those ti mes did you witness, di d you observe?  
 

A:
 W ell , as I tol d you the the first sense of brutalit y was when the Russi an prisoners of war 
came through, were driven through the town and the treatm ent of them. It was so cruel. I 

mean people who were so hungry and thi rsty and if someone uh went for for a bit  of food 

or
 for a cup of water...I mean the J ewish people have always been taught t o help, and uh 
you see people driven through...people ran to t he house to get especially water and 

somethi ng to drink wit h, and uh the Germans j ust t ur ned on them. I don't recall  them 

turning on the ones that were trying to give them t he food. I remember them t urning 

against  the ones that went for the food, and I thi nk thi s is  probably why it  left such a 

lastin g im pressi on on me is t hat i f if a man is hu ngry and reaches for som ethi ng, he gets 

beaten and and in s ome cases shot .  
 

Q:
 W hat ot her methods  did t he Germans have keeping...to keep the J ews in l ine?  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

A:
 Most ly by retaliation. P romisi ng that nothi ng will  happen to t he J ews if they cooperate 
and uh if 
anybody uh...if they found that som ethi ng was done against  their orders, by 
retaliation. I recall  a few men who had escaped to t he forest and uh actually the first 

partisans I guess I would call  them. Uh when that became known, the first t hing they did 

is
 
gather a certain amount of people, took them out i nto t he the main area, the the open 
area was the the synagogue courtyards...all  the  synagogues were located around a large 

courtyard, and shoot  them or take them away to be shot. Uh what t hey did i s to m a ke sure 

if...I don't recall ...I thi nk they took t hem away to be shot. They may have shot  several i n 

the ghett o it self but t he majorit y of the ti me they would take more people and then have 

the...some return to t ell  the stories, to t ell  of the...of the mann er in which the the others 
ones di ed.  
 
Q:
 R ae, we're going to change tapes now and uh that's onl y going to t ake up a couple of

Q:
 R achel, I want t o ask you...going back for a mi nute, uh under the ghett oiz ati on, there were 
J ewish l eaders, there were li aisons  to t he Germans among the J ewish comm unit y and I 

understand that som e of them argued against  resis tance, against  fighti ng. Do you recall  

that?  
 

A:
 P robably so, because every ti me that t here was any kind of a stand, uh the Germans 
would uh infli ct som e deaths and inj uries, so it  was a matt er of I thi nk conscious. I was 

much closer to t hat when we were in t he second ghett o, because at t hat t im e my mot her 

h
ad made up her mind t hat she's going to t ry to uh get out  of the ghett o and joi n with t he 
partisans and uh the leader of that particular ghett o uh was a a very...I don't know how to 

put i t...uh not  reall y defiant but  som eone who who had the understanding o f what was 

happening to ot hers and a brother-
in
-law of his was a physician. My mot her felt  that if 
she, as a woman comi ng int o a group...who wants a woman...who wants a woman wit h a 

chil d that's a responsi bil it y, but i f she brought som eone with her who cou ld contribut e 

(cough)...ex cuse me...who could contribut e, that uh she would be more welcome and thi s 

particular leader's sons  also wanted to get away and uh I remember his answers. W e used 

to m eet i n his house and he had a daughter my age and he wanted his  chil dren very much 

to survive a
nd I understand one of his sons di d survive. However uh would...and possibl y 
the the daughter too, but  uh they did want t o be in t ouch with anyone because there were 

some J ewish people who had hard feeli ngs against  their fat her, but uh... 
 
Q:
 Because he had been the liaison t o the Germans?  
 
A:
 Uh yes. Because in that posit ion I guess t here were som eti mes when he knew about t hings 
and uh it  was a matt er of uh saving the majority. Uh...  
 

Q:
 S o was that t he underlying...the underlying way of thinki ng...saving...what was good for 
the greatest num ber?  
 

A:
 W hat was good for the greatest num ber. Actually, he was taken away before the second 
ghett o was uh l iqui dated. He was taken out of the ghett o with hi s whole fami ly. I don't 

know what t he circumst ances were but t he two sons defied the Germans and managed to 

run away from them. I don't know whether the the father would have been taken to 

another ghett o, whatever. It ended up that the father was ki ll ed and uh the wife...the 
mot her too
, but t he two sons and a daughter escaped, ran away from the Germans. The 
older son was shot . The younger one and the daughter were not, and they were hidi ng out 
in t he ghett o for a li tt le bit and all  the J ews there were so scared of their own well -being, 

of their own survival, they were ready to t o uh give them back to t he Germans, give them 

away, and the son did escape and uh reall y became a hero in the in the partisans, but we 

don't know for sure whether they survived or not, but  that was a very good ex a mpl e 
where what do you do for the good of the comm unit y. Uh...  
 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

Q:
 The the reason I askedthat questi on is because when we look back at t hat t im e in hi story 
in retrospect, a questi on that always comes is  why wasn't t here more resis tance. W hy 

didn't t he J ews fight?  W hat was it  at t hat t im e that all owed thi s to h appen?  
 

A:
 W ell , there were several t hings. One of them i s the fami ly unit . Uh it wasn't 
every...everybody for him self...maybe more people could have survived if they would 

have left t heir fami li es a nd gone on. Uh if you try to escape with a fami ly and with 

chil dren, it  becomes much more difficult. The men did not want t o leave their wives and 

chil dren. S ome of them did. S ome of them figured they'll  get out  and maybe they'll  bring 

theirfami li es. S ome  of them did bring their fami li es. But i t was a matt er of how do you 
put yourself in t he posi ti on of perhaps being the cause of somebody else's death. How do 
you li ve with yourself the rest of the tim e?  
 

Q:
 You menti oned that the J ewish comm unit y had been very ti ght -knit , very well -organiz ed 
and I guess t he questi on also arises, why didn't t he J ewish comm unit y organiz e against  

theiroppressors?  
 

A:
 R emember that t hey were surrounded by people who were not l ooking to help them but t o 
hinder them. There was n ot reall y any place to go. The partisans did not  reall y get 

organiz ed very well  unti l probably the fall  of '43. Uh there were li tt le groups here and 

there. They were hit  and mi ss. Uh the first parti sans, and my mot her was very much in 

touch wit h them...the re were a few of the young men who escaped to t he forest and the 
way they accumul ated a few weapons was by uh st aking out s ome roads and finding a 
lonely...a lone I shoul d say...German sol dier who would pass by that they could uh ki ll  

and take his weapons,  because that was the only way to t ake the the weapons from a 

soldi
er. Uh (laughter) I don't know whether...at t hat poi nt I thi nk it  was a matt er of kil l or 
be kil led. Uh they accumul ated a few weapons. S ome of the Russ ians...Rus sian prison o f 

wars also h ad escaped. Uh you know, when when people are treated like this , it  doesn't 

matter...li fe or death...uh t he li ne between li fe and death becomes very, very narrow, and 

uh it 's a matt er...well , do I get ki ll ed and end my suffering or do I escape and have a 

chance to l ive and uh then then it 's much easier to escape, but when you're the cause of 

the rest of your fami ly's deaths, I mean it  it 's very difficult. Als o there was no pl ace reall y 

to run. You li ved in a...amongst t he population t hat was ready and will i ng to hand you 

over to the Germans again. It was onl y under the threat of fear that t hosepeople provided 

the food to t he partisans. Once the partisans were able to get som e weapons and once they 
had made contact wit h the uh Russi ans behind t he li nes, then  it  became much easier 
be
cause at t hat poi nt t he R ussi ans had already sent...when the front was organiz ed, uh the 
R ussi ans had sent uh l eadership, amm unit ions and some supplies. Other than that, 

whatever supplies, whatever fighti ng suppl ies there were, wer e only very primi ti ve or 

what was uh t aken from t he Germans.  
 
Q:
 W as there also i n thi s...i n thi s lack of resis tance, a denial that we are, as you say, the 
upper crust, the the bourgeois?  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
23
 
 
 
A:
 I I don't see that way. I don't see that way. I...maybe...maybe I'm naive or maybe I was 
naive as a chil d. Uh I remember quite a number of people who would...wanted to get out  

of the ghett o, wanted to escape. S ome of them did. From the second ghett o, that particular 

ti me when we tried to organiz e an escape, som e of the  people were caught. It j ust s o 

ha
ppened we...we were the last wave to get out  and by then we knew we couldn't. It was 
organiz ed that that particular night, a groupwas going to l eave and som e of them got 

caught and uh this  particular leader was was taken at t hat poi nt. He was bl amed for it . He 

did not  oversee the people well  enough, and then...  
 

Q:
 W hat happened to hi m?  
 

A:
 W ell , I mentioned to you he got ki ll ed. He and his  fami ly were taken whether in 
retaliation or whatever, but his s ons fought back and uh and managed to escape. I know 

that one had died of his wounds and uh the other...the the younger son and daughter I'm 

not su re. W ord had that they escaped but he was so afraid t o to be in contact wit h any of 

the J ewish. But t here was reall y no place to go. There was no pl ace to go. You...you were 

in a uh...you were in a sit uati on that you're damned if you do and you're damned if you 

don't. You don't want t o die. You know  you're going to di e. It was jus t a questi on maybe. 

You know, hope is what keeps us all  li ving and the hope was that m aybe, maybe the the 

R ussi ans are going to regroupand uh and li berate us before the Germans have a chance to 

kil l us. And as long as the Germans could elicit s ome sort...som e sort of labor or some 

sort of uh uh valuables from the comm unit y, we were sti ll  of some use.  
 

Q:
 I'm going to ask you, R ae, to si t up a lit tl e bit  straighter. You're leaning to one side. Is 
that...how does that l ook?  OK. Uh you talk about t heir keeping hope ali ve in su ch dire 

circumst ances, when you'v e lost  your father. You've lost  your brother. You're li ving in t he 

forest. You're li ving in t he woods. You're li ving in hi ding places. How do you keep hope 

ali ve?  W hat consti tut es that hope?  
 

A:
 Gett ing through the...to the nex t day.  
 

Q:
 And and how do you  do that?  How...how do you find the strength?  
 

A:
 
You don't know any Yiddis h. I could give you a very good ex pressi on. I'll  try...I'll  try to 
translate it . You don't know how you will  react unt il  you find yourself in t he sit uati on. Uh 
look...I was what...t welve, thirteen years old. I I worked during the day in a spinni ng mi ll  
and managed to...m y mot her couldn't kni t for the life of her and the only...the only way 

you could...you could s tay in a ghett o and uh and survive there was to t o be worth 

somethi ng, s o I would knit  scarves and and socks and I hated to to kni t gloves. Those 

fingers...they were compl icated, and yet be able to read. I have learned in t he ghett o to 

knit  and to read at t he same ti me.  
 

Q:
 W ere there ti mes when you felt  or maybe even that yo u knew that your mother felt  that 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
24
 
 
thi s that t his s pare was greater than the hub?  
 
A:
 I don't know. I don't know. All I know is t hat m y mot her had pushed very hard to to 
survive and to not  just  to su rvive by herself but also to s ave me and it  it 's an obsess ion t o 

to t ry to st ay ali ve and uh she kept i n contact. S he managed to t o find acquaint anceship 

through the genti les that she knew uh who owed her favors. Actually one fami ly that had 

a lot  of our possessi ons and it  was a big risk because they would sm uggl e food to us  in 

the ghett o. They had actually smuggled a gun in t o my mot her and they helped smuggle 

us out , and that was taking a very great risk.  
 

Q:
 I want t o talk about when you were with t he partisan group. W hen did t hat happen?  How 
did you first j oi n up?  
 

A:
 Uh after...from the second ghett o, the ghett o at Glemboke,  uh that ghett o was going 
through the same process as our ghett o where it  was being consol idated. Uh people were 

taken away. Uh the the livi ng quarters were pushed in. It was ma de small er and sm all er 

and all  the signs were that uh it 's not  going to be long before that ghett o is l iqui dated too, 

and as I tol d you uh before, a cousi n was a photographer that uh t he Germans had used 

quit e a bit  and I guess t hey li ked him  too and he co uld come and go from t he ghett o at 

will . I mean he he was free. His st udio was out side of the ghett o and uh it  was known that 

uh who he was and what he was. Even though he had to return every night t o the ghett o, 

nonetheless uh t here were occasions  where t he Germans actually demanded that he stay 

outsi de of the ghett o for their purposes and uh he he was able to communi cate wit h the 
outsi de much easier and he sort of helped comm unicate so that we could escape. W e 
knew where the partisans were at t hat poi nt a nd uh took t he chance.  
 

Q:
 OK. Tell  me that...t he story of that ni ght when you made your...was it  a run to t he woods 
to...?  
 

A:
 It wasn't at night. It was in t he dayli ght. W e had uh dressed, gone outsi de the ghett o. I 
went out  to work every morning to t he spinn ing mi ll  and my mot her got dressed to go li ke 

to work too and then just  ski pped off to t he side, uh prearranged to m eet wit h a genti le 

woman who was to l ead us out  of town and I guess nobody questi oned...come to thi nk of 

it , if if my memory serves me right, we even hit ched a ride wit h the Germans on a truck, 

but i t was not ...  
 
Q:
 You hitched a ride wit h Germans?  
 
A:
 On a truck. They were going down the road. They stopp ed. W e were walki ng with t his 
woman. They askedif we wanted to ride, where we were going... 
 

Q:
 
You weren't wearing your star at t his...?  
 

A:
 Of course not. (Laughter)  No. Dressed...dressed like a peasant. Thi s woman met us and 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
25
 
 
brought us some clot hing and we quickly changed int o uh peasant clo...clot hing. I mean it  
wasn't m uch different  from what we wearing, but nonetheless uh a li tt le bit m ore...how 

shoul
d I say...to hi de our identi ty. And uh she took us  to a vill age eventually and uh from 
that vil lage...Mot her had already contacts and from thi s vi ll age uh we went on and I don't 

remember the circumst ances, but  I remember leaving that ghett o in i n broad dayli ght.  
 

Q:
 OK. S o what does it  mean to t o joi n up with a band of partisans?  W hat...what was that 
kind of li ke?  
 

A:
 W ell , it  was also a matter of being accepted. You know, you've got t o ...you've got t o have 
value again. You've got t o be able to do som ethi ng to t o have som ebody keep you, and uh 
well  Mot her had known quite a number of people and she had been in t ouch with t hem. 
They knew that uh s he had tried to get som e other people out. Of course, the doctor is t he 

one that they wanted and uh he he perished in t he ghett o and never got out . He was too 

known a personali ty and uh when we came there, there were a few J ewish m en there and 

they kind of uh eased it  for us. Mot her did the cooking and I did whatever I was tol d to 

do. Uh the
 partisan groupthat we were with were at t he edge of the forest. W e were not 
with t he main group. W hat t hey basicall y doing is uh  disrupti ng comm unicati ons, 

comm unicati ons m eaning train deliveries. Uh they would  go out and uh loosenthe bolts  

to som
e of the rail road tracks so a train could not go on. Disrupting the deli very to t he to 
the front li nes, som eti mes managing to bl ow up a couple of car loads of amm unit ion. It 

always had to be done in a manner that would  not be too suspi cious, that uh kind of could 

be
 accepted as poss ibl y even an accident because of retaliation.  
 

Q:
 How did you li ve?  In a house in t he woods or were you campi ng?  
 

A:
 In vil lages. In vil lages. S ometim es in u h house, dirt house. Som eti mes ju st und er the 
stars. It all depended on on what what happened. Remember the Germans were occupied 

at t he front li nes, so i t wasn't t hat t hey had uh you know, they had Germans l ivi ng in 

every house, in every vil lage, in every so forth. They were afraid of th ose deep forests . 

The forests  were so t hick and not onl y thi ck. Uh that area is kn own as the P olot ski Blot y. 

Uh the the marshes. You could s ink i nto t hosemarshes and never come out. They could 

not go in wit h a vehicle. You must  reali z e that t he Germans prided themselves on on their 

cleanli ness. If they got di rt on their boots , they didn't l ike it. They were not very apt t o uh 

to venture in. They would venture in every so often just  to hi t sort of an area and get out  

to di scourage the partisans  to coming to close to t o the rail road st ati ons, t o the to the 
ra
il road tracks and when they hit , we would run int o the forests  and that's when we would 
li ve, you  know, under the stars and when that would recede, uh we would come back out 
int o the vill ages. Those vil lagers...I don't know whether they reall y received the partisans 

with open arms, however they they had to go along with t he ti de too.  
 

Q:
 W hat do you mean?  
 

A:
 W ell , you know, it's it 's who puts t he highest fear into  you, and at t hat poi nt t he partisans 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
26
 
 
put t he greatest fear into t hem, t hat i f they ran to t he Germans, t hat t hey could not  return 
to t heir homes and their fami li es and then again how well  would the Germans t reat t hem. 

By then the Germans were feeli ng prett y much the uh the heat.  
 

Q:  W ere all  the partisans J ewish?  

 

A:
 Oh no. I tol d you...a lot  of...there weren't t hat m any J ews. A lot  of them...  
 

Q:
 Did they accept...t he the the partisans, did t hey accept...di d they know you were J ewish?  
 

A:
 Oh yes.  
 

Q:
 And they accepted you as part o f their band?  
 

A:
 Uh yes. As I said... 
 

Q:
 ...unified, the partisans...the J ews and...I mean I...  
 

A:
 Not unified them. P robably what uni fied them was the desire to get rid of the Germans. 
Uh should I say that the J ews were very welcome...I don't know. I d on't know. Uh there 

was qui te a bit  of anti -S emi ti sm i n the partisans too, but  it  was a matt er of who did what. 

There weren't t oo many J ewish...t oo many women. My mot her did the cooking and uh she 

was needed, so she did it . Uh I som eti mes peeled potatoes u nti l I couldn't feel m y fingers. 
S ometim es I would uh I was taught t o to t o do som e thi ngs with  the amm unit ion. I could 
take apart a rifle and clean it  probably faster than (laughter) than a sol dier could. M y li tt le 

fingers managed to t o get i nto pl aces wh ere big fingers couldn't get i n and it  was a matt er 

of what was your worth. Everybody had to t o have a certain worth.  
 

Q:
 How old was your mother at t his t im e?  
 

A:
 Mot her was born in 1906. 1943. Thirty...  
 

Q:
 Mi d -thi rties. She was a young woman at t he ti me . And when you look back on how...how 
she was able to su rvive and save you, what what ki nd of strength di d that take as a young 

woman and what ki nd of young woman was she?  
 
A:
 Uh mother was a chil d during the 1st W orld W ar. She uh she helped wit h the fami l y. S he 
went i nto bus iness rather early in l ife. Not only did s he run a busi ness but  uh she also 
helped a sis ter get i nto bus iness in a neighboring town. Uh Mother was a woman who 

ventured out i nto t he world. S he used to go to Lodz  to buy uh yard  

goods...W arsaw...Vil na was the main place, so she wasn't som ebody that came from the 

hint erlands and jus t st ayed in t he hint erlands. S he had a very good head on her shoulders. 
I can only tell you that the war ended and my mot her fell  apart.  
 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
27
 
 
Q:
 Now tell m e about t hat. S he had st ruggled so long for survival, as you said, t he one 
day...from one day to t he nex t j ust s urvivi ng, so what happens when when that is  no 
longer there?  
 

A:
 (Sigh)  A very sad story, very sad story. Uh my mot her always had thi s feeli ng that 
becaus e of who she was and what she was that she should have...she shoul d have saved 

everybody, and to t his day uh she she stil l keeps on t alki ng about what she should have 

done and what she could have done, but of course if she could have done it  she would 

have 
done it . Uh she li ves with  with t his feeli ng of inadequacy of then, not of now. S he 
never reall y adapted here. S he was never any longer what she was. S he had to s truggle to 

to earn a li veli hood. I mean si nce comi ng to t his country, I'll  tell you I've work ed...I don't 
remember ever not working. I went t o high school and worked. I went t o school...we 
moved to New York. Mot her thought t hat she was going to be able to get a job there and 

and manage bett er. The language was not  as much of a problem. W ashington reall y isn't a 

cit y where som ebody without  without  money and without  a professi on can can easil y 

survive and she did not  want t o be dependent on m y uncle and aunt. Uh we didn't find i t 

that easy in New York. Uh I hated New York. As soon as I graduated from  high 

sc
hool...i n the first pl ace I wanted to go to college and my only abil it y to go to college 
would be with m y uncle's help. I came here to W ashington and managed to get a very 

good job and go to s chool at night and uh reall y li ked thi s environment m uch  bett er than 

the N
ew York environment. S o Mot her came back with m e and and she reall y could 
never get a uh a decent j ob here, so i t was sort of a matter of just s urvivi ng.  
 
Q:
 W hat i n thos e im mediate days following the war...now now first of all , let's go back, uh 
take a step back...you're with t he partisan group. Do you know who led that groupthat 
you were with?  
 

A:
 Uh at t hat poi nt...I mean toward the end, by the tim e we came into t he partisans, they had 
a prett y much uh uh a comm and. The comm anders came  from R ussi a. Uh we were with a 

spec
ial groupso t here was jus t one comm ander over this s mall groupof people, but uh 
there was a chain of comm and that uh from from the brigade, and there were several 

brigades. The one that we were with was call ed  Medvedev, but t here were several 

brigades.  
 

Q:
 W ere...were any of the partisans ever captured?  
 
A:
 Oh yes.  
 
Q:
 W ere you ever captured?  
 

A:
 Oh we were captured during a blockade, but when partisans went out  on assi gnments uh 
to do t heir eit her demol it ion o r uh sabotage, uh many of them were captured. I remember 
one woman was captured. S he was J ewish t oo and uh she was returned in a potato sack in 
pieces and uh that that was the the lesson t he Germans were trying to t each is t hat i f you 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
28
 
 
triedto do t hat t o u s and we'll  show you what we can to do you. It never stopped anybody 
going out again.  
 

Q:
 W hat di d...what effect di d it  have on all  of you, on you in parti cular?  
 

A:
 I thi nk the effect i t had is rather than inti mi dati ng, it  became a chall enge, that I'll  go out 
a
nd I'll  do you even worse and I'll  get away with i t.  
 

Q:
 S o it  galvaniz ed you?  
 

A:
 P robably. P robably.  
 

Q:
 Uh was that t he normal fate of a partisan who was captured, som e horribl e death?  
 

A:
 Of course...som e horribl e death. Uh towards...closer to l iberati on in early 1944, uh the 
Germans t ried to rid t he forests  of the partisans because they were already in retreat and 

in order to to be able to fight t he war, they had to get rid of this m onkey on their back, 

somebody that that was infli cti ng all  kind s of uh disruptions  and they had...uh in additi on 

to t he Germans t here were som e R ussi an groups, actually it  was a Ukraini an groupin our 

part of the of the country...where a whole mi li tary unit  had turned themselves over to the 

Germans and they were fight ing on the side of the Germans and uh they were doing the 

dirty work for the Germans, and thos e people had what t hey call ed the blockade. They 

surrounded every ex it  from the forest. They kept on pus hing the partisans int o the into t he 
forest deeper and uh managed to t o capture quit e a number of us. Uh we were captured 
together with at that point  som e partisans and som e of the vil lagers because the vil lagers 

ran too. They were afraid t o st ay and also s ome of the partisans made them go with t hem 

because this was a protecti on, having, you know, blending int o int o the populati on and we  

were brought back to our home town and at t hat poi nt uh I had uh typhoid fever and I was 

shaven. My head was shaven, so dressed in boy's clothi ng, I looked very much like a boy 

an
d they were separati ng men and women. The Germans had thi s uh I don't know...phobia 
I guess, not  to keep men and women together, even boys and and and their mot hers, and 

they were going to separate me from my mot her and that was my my biggest fear and they 

were arguing...

boy, girl, boy, girl. Guess what I did?  
(Laughter)  I said I was amadchen, a girl, and uh si nce my mot her identi fied herself as 

my
 mot her, uhthey presumed that she was genti le and she was harboring a J ewish chil d.  
 
Q:
 How did t hey know you were J ewish?  
 
A:
 Because I said the word madchen. W here do I know it from?   
 

Q:
 
That's a Yiddi sh word?  
 
A:
 W ell , it 's the same. It's very sim il ar. You mus t reali z e that mos t of the genti les in t hat part 
of the country are prett y il li terate and uh did not  catch on to German.

Q:
 Oh I see. You understood the German...?  
 

A:
 I understood the German conversati on. If I understood the German and when the cards are 
down, you kind of come up with an inner strength.  
 

Q:
 
W hat effect do you thi nk it  had on your mother and yourself to know that t he key to your 
survival m eant denying being a J ew?  To vehemently...vehemently deny being a J ew. In 

fact, at that mom ent your survival depended on con vincing som eone else. 
 

A:
 
Oh that part was easy. That part was easy. S urvivi ng is what m att ered. But I'll  tell you 
somethi ng. As much as survivi ng mattered, we had very li tt le to eat and the only thi ng 

avail able was pork and I would not eat pork and neit he r would m y mot her. My mot her 

cooked it  for the partisans but we never ate it. W e'd sooner eat j ust a potato.  
 

Q:
 S o in your own ways, you kept your J ewish observances, what you could?  
 

A:
 Uh adhered to t he J ewish principl es. I wouldn't say we kept t he J ewi sh observances. W e 
adhered to J ewish principl es wherever possibl e. Uh if it  was a matt er of li fe and death, i t's 

a different st ory. P robably if somebody would have tol d me to eat pork to prove that I 

wasn't J ewish, I would eat i t. Maybe I would be sick to my stom ach later but I would eat 

it  but when there was a choice, no questi on.  
 
Q:
 Uh let m e ask you about what happened when the war ended...and how did you know?  
How did t he news reach you?  
 
A:
 W ell , what happened was is  that we...eventually we joi ned the  partisans again. W e had to. 
W
e couldn't...now long can you hide amongst a populati on of non -J ews, especially for my 
mot her where she was known throughout t he area. Eventually som ebody recogniz ed her 

and she overheard some women talking. S he thi nks t hat no body knows it . There were no 

Germans around. That was the...that was our luck. S he says nobody knows that...no...s he 

thi nks t hat t hat you can fool everybody. Mot her tried to st ay out of the way. I was...at that 

point  I was the one that had to organiz e som e  foodand I was the one that that went out  

a
nd brought news. S upposedly she was si ck and couldn't m ove, but nonetheless, you 
know, you you st ay in vi ll ages. Uh somebody sees you and uh Mot her overheard that uh 

that som ebody recogniz ed her and at t hat poi nt  there were som e people, of course, that 
we
re sympatheti c too and uh told us  where there were som e partisans beginni ng to 
organiz e again, and that's what we did. W e went and I joi ned up with t hem and uh 
actually had a very long march to t o try to t o get ou t of the way of the armies. Tried to t o 

joi n a unit  and uh at t hat poi nt, I mean there was communi cati on. There were radios, 

because they...the groupcomm unicated wit h the...actually with t he R ussi ans behind t he 

li nes.  
 

Q:
 S o before that ti me you survived for that short period of ti me actually li ving with 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

Germans...German sol diers?  
 
A:
 No. Livi ng with t he peasants. But wit h the Germans being very close by.  
 

Q:
 And you mot her was a cook?  
 

A:
 No. In the partisans, the Germans...but  when I'm...after the blocka de when we were 
caught by the Germans...t hat's when we li ved amongst t he vil lagers, before we rejoi ned 

the partisans again. But i n the...wit h the partisan group, Mot her was a cook.  
 

Q:
 Now you're with t he partisan groupand the Germans are now retreati ng a nd som ehow's 
there a sense that the end of the war is comi ng. Is that correct?  
 

A:
 Yes. S ee by...by the uh latt er part of the occupati on, uh when the Russi ans were already 
advancing, we had comm unicati on. The partisans had comm unicati on with t he with t he 

R ussi an armies.  
 

Q:
 S o you knew the war...the end of the war was coming?  
 

A:
 W e knew that t he R ussi ans were comi ng. W e knew where...which directi on they were 
comi ng from, and we were actually heading in t hat di recti on to j oin up wit h them.  
 

Q:
 OK. S o there was one day where the war ended for you. Do you remember that day?  
 

A:
 Vaguely. Very vaguely. All I remember is sl eeping...sl eeping in a house and not worrying 
about anythi ng. It was st il l very unsett led. To give you an ex ampl e, no sooner did the war 

end when we had to again be very wary because some of the population, when they 

reali z ed there were som e J ews that remained ali ve, uh tried to elim inate us.  
 

Q:
 W hy?  W hy did t hey care at t hat poi nt?  
 

A:
 Anti -S emi ti sm. Hate.  
 

Q:
 Hate that t hat...  
 

A:
 That J ews...(sigh) I don't know if any of you can possi bly understand what i t i s li ke to l ive 
in a c
omm unit y where there is s o much bell igerence, where you're so despis ed, where 
you're not wanted. I mean we read in t he papers about t he the the uprising in P oland an d 

so forth, but  you also reali z e that the same people had call ed on all  the J ews to l eave the 

country and that is  already during the the affil iation wit h Rus sia, after the war, many years  

after the war, twenty years after the war. 
 
Q:
 S o the anti -S emi ti sm  was fueled by the hardship im posed on the Pol ish people by the 
wa
r?  It was always there, but you didn't feel i t.  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

A:
 It...i t...i t was always there. It's jus t t hat probably as a chil d in a protecti ve environment, I 
didn't feel i t.  
 

Q:
 S o there was st il l a  threat.  
 

A:
 
Of course. 
 

Q:
 
I mean what what what consti tut ed safety?  W hat what...after the war was over and and 
you faced yet another threat...?  
 
A:
 After the war was over, it was a matt er now of how to get out  of where you were. Uh my 
mot her particularly 
wanted to get out  from the Russi an area and uh she was able to uh di g 
up som e valuables that were hidden and uh managed to bribe uh...was  a work...working 
train. You know, the the stations were prett y much uh destroyed, and uh the only 

movement of troops was by by rail road and uh restructuring the the statio ns and the 

rail roads was of prim ary uh need in order to move towards the front li nes, so M other 

signed on...si gned on...bribed somebody to accept us as part of the workforce and we 

were heading towardC entral P oland. Her main obj ecti ve was to get as close to t he 

li ne...we knew that t he Americans were pushi ng from the other side, so we knew that t he 

R ussi ans and the Americans were eventually to m eet, so t he idea was to get as close to 

that area as poss ib le and to go over to the American si de.  
 
Q:
 W here did t hat happen?  
 
A:
 For us, i t di dn't happen that easil y. It happened in Italy, but uh...t here was...i t was a long 
way from eastern P oland to Italy. Uh our first di recti on was toward the Balt ic Sea 

actuall y. Uh Mother thought by going straight t oward Germany...and that's where the train 

was going, however, when we came to P russia, condit ions were terrible. The P russians 

had mi ned anythi ng and everythi ng that they could. They mi ned the chandeli ers. They 

mi ned the the equipm ent i n the houses. They mi ned themselves so when the Russi ans 

went t o remove the bodies, they they kil led themselves and mi ned themselves. They were 

blown up. Uh it became very dangerous and also m y mot her ran int o a general, a J ewish 

general, and uh after a conversati on, a short conversati on, he kind of all uded to i t t hat he 

was J ewish and he said if you thi nk that the Germans were bad, wait  and see what await s 

us. He advised her to to head sout h. He heard there were som e J ews in sout hern P oland, 
and the nex t t hing was he actually arranged for...brief...we li ved in a box  car wit h another 
J ewish fami ly...for that box  car to be hooked on to a train heading that directi on.  
 

Q:
 W hat was he all uding to...await s you where?  
 

A:
 The anti -S emi ti sm an d the hardships, i f we remained in i n P oland.  
 

Q:
 In P oland. And he was...he was a general wit h the Pol ish army?

A:
 W it h the Russi an army. No more P oli sh army. No more P oli sh army.  
 

Q:
 S o your mother headed sout h to Italy. That's...?  
 

A:
 Now we headed so uth. W e found ourselves in Lubli n, which is s outhern P oland. Uh 
over...when we came to Lubli n, actually the war was st il l going on. Uh we were in 

C z echosl ovakia by the tim e we heard that t he war was coming to an end and we actually 

crossed int o Italy just  about...when we came to Italy we found out t hat uh t he war is 

ended.
 
 
Q:
 W hat was the li ke for you to receive that news that t he war had ended?  
 
A:
 I remember more comi ng int o Italy, comi ng through the Alps. Uh t he the trip was rather 
trying. Uh we stayed in Hungary for a while where P oles in general were not very much 

li ked and J ews definitely not but  at t hat poi nt uh t he Israeli s have already sent uh people 

to t o organiz e the J ews, to uh t o take charge sort of, to m ake the the trek toward Israel, 

and our 
int enti ons were not t o come to the Unit ed S tates. Our int enti ons were to reach 
Israel. That was the only haven. Uh when we came to Lubli n, uh there were already a few 

Israeli  uh people, not necessaril y Israeli -born, probably P oli sh born, but who came to 

organiz e the J ews and prepare them for the trek to Israel and uh from there we went t o 

C z echosl ovakia and then to Hungary and it  was all on on t he way to uh t o get across int o 

the occupied z ones ot her than the Russi an occupied z ones. And there are certain i n cidents 
that st and out i n my mi nd. One of the incidents t hat st ands out  in m ind i s uh comi ng 
to...so rt of gett ing across the border between Hungary and Austria and hit ti ng upon 

Britis h troops who sent us back to t he R ussi an si de because we were in t he wron g place. 

And uh at t hat t im e we already had the guides uh that were sent by Israel and we had to 

cross the Alp...t he Alps. W e went t hrough som e of the passes in t he Alps and the thing 

that st ands out  most  in m y mi nd is crossing int o Italy. W e were cold. W e  were hungry. 

W
e were froz en, not j ust cold, and I saw an Israeli  flag, the blue and white flag with t he 
J ewish st ar and I was sure I was hallucinati ng and uh, you know, all  of us sort of...do you 

see it ?  W hat do you see?  S ee blue and white flag with wit h the J ewish st ar on it. W ell , it  

was the Israeli   brigade and I didn't t ell  you how well  we were received, but not onl y that. 

Of all  the people there, everybody...where are you from?  I come from a li tt le town nobody 

heard of. And of all  the people to meet, my governess' brother. I couldn't get over it . I ran 

for my mot her. Mother met hi m. M other remembered him  when he left for Israel and uh 
he gave me and I sti ll  have it , the soldi ers had a li tt le tiny bibl e. It's about t hat bi g. 
P robably three by four inches...t hat he carried and uh he gave it  to m e, so t hat I would not 

forget m y studi es, and the fact t hat I had not s poken Hebrew since 19 probably 41, to be 

able to to communi cate, to be able to speak, to be able to get m y...my feeli ngs across and 

to understand what was being said, probably the the most  joyous t im e that I know of. I 

thi nk it  was more joyous t han comi ng to t he United St ates.  
 

Q:
 S o was your intention at that ti me to go to Israel?  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
33
 
 
 
A:
 Oh yes.  
 

Q:
 S o how...what happened?  
 

A:
 W hat happened. W e s tayed with t he brigade for about t hree days. W e were put i n trucks. 
A boat was wait ing som e place in Italy, and our truck broke down. There were quit e a  

number of J ews that were coll ected near Bologna in Italy and uh needless to s ay when a 

truck breaks do wn, you don't go any further. W e mi ssed that boat. W e mi ssed three boats. 

W e even mi ssed the Ex odus. And by then uh things became prett y clear that uh i t was 

difficult t o get i nto Israel. S omehow my mot her got si ck. Mot her was very sickly after 
that. Uh I 
would say more dead than ali ve and uh she...she developed asthm a which was 
probably psychosom ati c. At least i t was di agnosed psychosom ati c asthm a here in t he 
United St ates, but i t seemed like the sli ghtest...sl ightest ex cit ement would bring on an 

att ack, and unless I got her a shot  of adrenali n, God knows what would happen. And uh 

we were supposed to leave to t o meet t he Ex odus when she had a very bad att ack of 

asthm a and she was taken to t he hospi tal and I thought t he the world came at an end 

because we were not going to get out  of there. W e were not going to get t o Israel, and uh 

at t hat poi nt, we managed...som ehow Mother had heard about t hat you could put  in an ad 

int o the forwards and she remembered writ ing the address t o my uncle and aunt. Actually 

my aunt was my father's si ster...that it  was W ashington, DC , so som ebody saw our name 

in t he paper, happened to alert my uncle to it  and uh he wrote to the forwards who could 

forward the letter to us  and we made contact and uh he was will ing to...he wrote us n ot t o 
try to go anywhere and he would try to t o get us o ver. He made out papers but the Pol ish 
quota was full, s o we couldn't come. They were letti ng just  a trickle in and I'm sure if we 

would have wait ed for the Pol ish qu ota, I don't know when we would ha ve gott en to t he 

United St ates, but because my mot her knew, you know that we were so close to R ussi a 

and convinced the Council t hat uh s he actually was born on the R ussi an si de, that uh we 

were able to come on the R ussi an quota which was open because very few people 

im mi grated from Rus sia to t he United St ates over quite a number of years, and uh so we 

came in November 1947. November 17, 1947 we came to the Unit ed S tates.  
 

Q:
 Throughout t he war and the hiding and the freez ing and the starving, your mother 
re
mained st rong and was able to go forward. After the war, she became sick.  
 

A:
 Yes.  
 

Q:
 W hy is t hat?  
 

A:
 I guess coming to t he reali z ati on that in t he first pl ace the struggle to survive kind of 
ended and mi ssi ng everybody and as I've mentioned to you, she kind of felt  that uh she 

was a big busi ness woman and she she could do m ost anythi ng and the thing that would 
have mattered to her the most , shewasn't able to do.  
 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

 W hich was?  
 
A:
 S aving her fami ly.  
 

Q:
 Do you thi nk it  was onl y then that she all owed her self to ex perience her loss?  
 

A:
 P robably. You know, we're all  strong during bad ti mes, but we fall  apart during good 
ones, and I thi nk that's the ti me when when it  finally hit  her. I've survived, but...  
 

Q:
 W hat di d it  mean to you to come to America?  
 
A:
 I don't know whether it  reall y meant anythi ng to come to America. It's what what I've 
ex perienced in America that became to mean quit e a bit  to m e.  
 
Q:
 And what's that?  
 

A:
 Oh...going to school, freedom, uh being able to walk t he streets, being able to hol d my 
head up high, being an equal even though I wasn't an equal. I was st il l l ivi ng a  

_nightm are, but nonetheless I had all  the opportuni ty and could t ake advantage of those 

opportuni ti es. I was an equal i n respect wit h being able to do what I...th e goals t hat I had 

set for myself. 
 

Q:
 Did you return to reli gious o bservances that you weren't able to __ during the war?  
 

A:
 Oh I'm probably less observant now than I was then.  
 

Q:
 W hy is t hat?  
 

A:
 Uh I thi nk int egrati ng meant an awful l ot. Going out on a date and having to go to a 
kosher restaurant and uh not be able to go out on a Saturday night up unt il  a certain t im e, 

not being able to get a job that I needed so badly other than working on S aturday. My first 

ex perience was I went wit h a friend of mi ne  from school t o to l ook for for a job, a 

summ
er job, and every job I went for I had to work on S aturday. I had to ride on S aturday 
to get t o my job. I thi nk it 's li tt le by li tt le uh those feeli ngs uh break down. You know, 

you take...you do one thi ng and th en you're all owed to do t he nex t one. It's...unl ess you 

keep a very strict observance, there's no such thing as jus t sl ightl y strict.  
 

Q:
 Uh the adjust ment...there were good...there were many good thi ngs about being in 
America, but t he adjust ment was not  e asy?  
 

A:
 It reall y wasn't t oo difficult for me because when I came to my uncle's house, I became 
the fourth daughter. P robably being a li tt le bit resented by the others but uh my uncle was 
a a very...very smart and good natured man. The first ex ampl e...was  very im portant for 
y
oung ladies on t heir six teenth bi rthday to get t heir first fur coat. W ell  low and behold, 

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082

his daughter was made to wait  to get her first fur coat unt il  I came here and we got 
identical ones. Needless to s ay, I can understand now why my cousi n resented me a li tt le 

bit
. (laughter) 
 

Q:
 Uh what i s your life li ke today?  
 

A:
 W hat i s my li fe li ke today?  I guess t he same as any American fami ly. My chil dren went t o 
coll ege. They've got ni ce professi ons. They are devoted chil dren, to a point. W e try to l et 

them li ve their own lives, and som eti mes they thi nk we...they probably put m ore...more 

requirements on t hem t han what t hey would li ke but uh nonetheless we have a good 

relations hip wit h them.  
 

Q:
 W hy is i t i mportant for you to do t his, for you to document your ex periences?  
 

A:
 W ell , when I survived the war, probably not unt il  I fini shedschool I shoul d say...even in 
school because uh when I went t o high school uh Hebrew was offered and uh I needed a 

language requirement and that was an easy language requirement. I could get a lot of...a 

lot  of credit s by just  taking one semester and taking the regent's ex ami nati on, but I 

became very much aware of the fact of of passi ng on J udaism . Uh amaz ingly enough, 

there was a a German woman. S he was my counse lor, and she was very apprehensive at 

first when she found out...when I was assigned to her. Ms. R eef (ph) felt  li ke she had to 

set t hings st raight and probably helped me a great deal i n judging people uh on their 

merit s. S he helped me a great deal get t hr ough school and adjust  to school and uh accept I 
guess som e of the prejudi ces, I guess, i n school and deal wit h them and make me aware 
that I have som e...som ethi ng to pass on too. Uh she got m e to su bsti tut e in Hebrew class. 

If the teacher couldn't m ake it , there were very few Hebrew uh substi tut es, and I guess I 

was a bett er substi tut e than anybody they could get t o babysit  and that's sort of like 

passi ng on. I remember saying...her saying to m e, well  you know it and you can im part 

more than somebody else.  It became a matter of imparting. Uh... 
 

Q:
 
W hat i s im portant for you to i mpart t o future generati ons about t he past?  
 

A:
 Oh, our heritage. The the J ewish ex periences. I thi nk thos e ex periences repeat and repeat 
themselves. I hope they never...wil l never have to ex perience anythi ng even remot ely 

sim il ar to to what happened in Europe. I thi nk there is an underlying anti -S emi ti sm no  

matter where we are. I thi nk it  comes a lot  from jealousy. Uh I reall y feel t hat i n P oland it 
came a lot  from jealousy. The J ews  were...they were not allowed to own land. It was...i t 
wa
s by necessi ty that they became the trades people. Uh by necessi ty that uh they they 
were the merchant class. They were the middl e class. There were a lot  of poor people too, 

but t here were also a lo t of quit e well -
to
-do J ews.  
 

Q:
 There's J udaism  in passing on observances,  but  there's also...what i s the the importance 
to you to pass on your ex periences of the Holocaust t o maybe your own grandchil dren?  

W hat i s the value in that?  

USH MM Arch ives  RG-50.030*0082  
36
 
 
 
A:
 The value in that is t o beware if...if you see anythi ng leading in t hat di recti on to t ake steps 
be
fore it  happens. Uh I'm very much for B'nai B'rith (ph) because they are...they're on the 
look out  for anythi ng that may develop i nto so mething that can go further, that that c an 

become destructi ve and detrimental. Uh I thi nk...I thi nk hate comes from jealousy. Uh 

there's no questi on about i t t hat Hit ler's being able to control and uh being able to get t he 

P oles to do what t hey did against  the J ews, came from the fact t hat uh t a king...taking 

away the the focus on where the people should focus and focusing it  on hate.  
 

Q:
 Do you thi nk it  could happen again?  
 
A:
 It's happened how many ti mes before?  They say hist ory repeats i tself. I hope not i n my 
ti mes and not i n my chil dren's ti m es and my grandchil dren's ti mes. And I hope thi s 
country  conti nues to t o be watchful and that we'll  never know anythi ng li ke thi s.

 Not reall y. I'm not  sure what ki nd of photos . I thi nk he took m ostl y photos  of the

portrait  photographer. He li ves in  Israel now and uh he had two sons. Uh his  wife
