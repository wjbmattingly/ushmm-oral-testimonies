Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Esther Fol
, conducted by 
Christian
 
Url
 on Novemb er 8, 2008, in
 Alexandria, 
Virginia. Esther
, first of all, thank you very much
 for taking the time to give this 
interview to the 
United Sta tes 
Ho locaust Memo rial Museum. You were kind 
enough to fill out the questio
nnaire. Why don™t we start 
talking about the earliest 
memo ry you have of your ch ildhood. 
What™s the first 
me mory you have? 
Answer: I do Œ I can™t answer
 exactly what first because 
my memory is not Œ I Œ I 
remember a little bit here, a 
little bit there, but I canno
t put them together, and I 

cannot say which one first, and which one is
 second. But I rememb
er when I was in 
the children home, very, very young, th
e Germans came in and start shooting the 
kids. And th ey Œ that part left me
 in such a horror, so when I came to
 Israel,
 I 
would always think about a 
fox who Œ who killed the kids
 except me. And when I 
met the 
[in d ecipherable]
 here, I ask her, why they sh oot the kids? Why they  didn™t 
kill me? So she said, the kids were boys w
ho were circumcised. 
You were a girl so 
you were not circumcised, that™s wh
y. So the Germans were looking for 
circumcised boys to kill them
, an d they killed them righ
t there at th e spot. And 
luckily Œ I was wounded also, w
ith one of the shots, and I still have Œ I have a s Œ in 
my  leg, a problem with that. Both legs, yeah. 
Q: Wow. And when  was this?

A: They shot me too. That™s happened Œ I do not know the year, I mean, I was too 
young to say what year. That™s was during the war. In 
Slonim
, in 
Alberton
 Œ in
 
Alberton
 Children Home in 
Slonim.
 Bu t the name of the children home was 
Alberton.
 
Slonim , Poland
 at the time. 
Q: Yeah. Do  you have any memo ries Œ ho
w did your mo th er explain to you th e 
situation you were in? How did she explai
n to you why these things happened  to  
you? Wh at Œ 
A: My mother Œ I never knew my mo
ther, I did not know my father. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: My mother, when I was 
very, very Œ when I was si
x months old, she put Œ 
what™s happened is she put me in Œ on th
e footsteps of a home where Œ that™s was a 
nursing home. And the woman, who was a 
good friend of her, a Christian wowan Œ 
woman, her name was hern Œ 
Helena Westerly. 
And she had a plan . She gave my  
mother two identities, two pass
ports with false name, and ha
d put me in a Œ in Œ in a 
footsteps of that nursing home. My mo ther
 was behind the bushes of the nursing 
home, looking what™s happened  to  me. And 
in  the mo rning th e cook came in, and 

they saw a baby, and they said, what we 
going to do with th
is baby? And they 
decided to  put me in a children home. They Œ

she pretended she did not know who I was. And I was given a name, as

Onay
(ph) 
Vido Œ Vidomska
(ph), which is mean, the unknown.

u wh en you learned wh at had happened to you, or to 
your parents? Where was your father at 
the time your mo ther gave you to th is 
nursing home? 

A: My father? He probably was dead already. 

Q: Oh, okay. Ok ay. 
A: I was before it in a ghe
tto. My mother did escape w
ith me from the ghetto, and 
somehow we™re back in the gh etto. We escaped, we went to
 different countries, and 
some Œ I do not know why she returned  ba
ck, what™s happened
, the circumstan ces 
exactly, I was too young to 
know. And she returned , and a Œ back to  the ghetto. 
Q: So your mother wa
s able to escape Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ from the ghetto, with
 a baby, so to speak?

 area of 
Poland.
 And in 1944, she Œ she went Œ

they were raiding the partis
an, the Germans. At one poin
t I do remember that I was 
in a train, I do not know wh at™s happened 
exactly. I was on a train and th at Œ in a 
train, a lot of people were there. They 
couldn™t move, nothing. And I saw people 
jump ing off the train, escaping. And I was told
 to be quiet. And th
en the train got hit 
by a mi Œ by a mine or something they thre
w. The partisan attacked the train, and 
the train could not go any fa
rther, and I don™t have no more memory after that, 
what™s happened . This is one of the things
 I remember. And I re
me mb er I was in  th e 
woods with a man, a tall man, and he told me  to be behind the tree, to wait for him, 
he™ll going in the wo ods, not to move. I 
stood behind it Œ a wide tree so nobody can 
see me , which I waited there, and the man never came  back. So I went to look fo r 
the man, and I saw him lay on th e floor, with
 blood in  his mouth, and his eyes open. 
So I start talking to the man to take me 
with him, and why he doesn™t talk? Why he 

look at me and doesn ™t say nothing? So  suddenly a wo man come out from the 

woods, and she told me, this
 man is dead. I said, what 
does it mean dead? And she 
told me, a person that cannot talk, cannot
 breathe, and cannot speak and can do 
nothing. That™s it. And I ne Œ I 
do not know who was that man. 

Q: And this woman took 
you with her afterwards? 
A: I don™t remember n o  more. 
Q: Mm-hm.

and what was it.  
Q: Your mo ther Œ when  did you learn ab
out your mother™s fa
te? Do you know the 
circumstan ces, or Œ 

A: I learn Œ I learn in Œ after a Œ I learned in 1960 in 
Israel
, 1960 or 1962 in
 Israel
. 
But I did not know much ab
out my mother, nothing. I ju
st knew that she died, my  
parents died . 
Q: What exactly had happened to  her? 
A: That she joined the par tisan, and the Germans attacked the partisan, and sh e was 

guarding at the time th e partisans, and they
 shot her. They Œ she was fighting with 
the Germans, and she killed quite a few Germ
ans too, I was told. So it wasn™t like 
she just went and they killed her. There wa
s a big fight between the partisan and the 

Germans, and sh e got shot off. She was fi
ghting with them Œ 
against the Germans 
too, at the time. 
Q: Let™s go back to your Œ to

citizen to retu
rn back to 
Poland. 
So, he was allowed to return
 back, so he went back 
to the city. And 
Helena Westerly
 was looking for him, because they said, 
Mina 
Pajewski
(ph) did not come back from
 Pola nd  Œ
 I mean, from the war. And what™s 
going to  be with 
So nja
? My name was
 Sonja
, 
Sonja Pajewski
(ph). What™s going 
on with 
Sonja  P a jewski
(ph) is still there? And so Œ 
and th at nobody came to pick 
her up. So sh e went to  the bazaar places
 to look for somebody
 from the family, and 
one day she met my  uncle there, and sh e to
ld him that Œ that Œ wh ere I am, and he 
didn't  even know I was born. And Œ because 
he left the place in 1941, before I was 
born. And he Œ the Russian took me. They m
ove into a remo te area, that™s why. So  
meanwhile, I was born, and all that, and I Œ 
now he found out that I™m Œ that he has 
a niece there. So he went to the children 
home, and he told them that he is my 
father. So they let him to take me out, and 
he went with  me Œ he did tell me that he 
bought me a piece of Œ a bread with piece 
of butter Œ with Œ a bread with butter to 
eat, and he says, some body came and stole 
the bread from my  hands, and I cried. 
Now he did say that I had a lot of bruise
s all over my body, and I suffer from severe 
malnutrition, I looked so ba
d. And he Œ we went to 
Poland
, to 
Wars za wa ,
 
Warsaw. 
And at that time, I think 
Slonim 
became part of Œ part of 
Soviet Unio n
 
already, I think, at the time. So we Œ 
we went to rush Œ he brought me to 
Warsza wa
, to Œ and he™s staying some Jewish 
place, the Jewish 
agency helped two

of us, and there was a place they were 
Œ they helped different de Œ different 
refugees, and so  they helped me and my  uncle
. And he told me that I Œ I slept in bed 
Œ in one bed, because they 
didn™t have enough beds th
ere. And I again did wee-wee 
on th e Œ you know, pee-pee on the bed, and 
he got all wet from that. And that™s was 
my problem at that time. Then he Œ he was 
very sick, so he coul
dn™t take care of 
me, and he Œ he sent Œ he gave me to a Je
wish agency, and tha-th
at was to send me 
to 
Palestine
, at the time was
 Palestine,
 not 
Israel
 yet. So the Jewish agency took 
me an d  pu t me in  
Lódz, 
in a children home. I 
do not know where in 
Lódz,
 what city 
Œ I like to know all these particular. If you 
can find out this information, please 
allow me to know that. 
Q: Yep. 
A: All right. In
 Lódz
, I was staying sometimes ther
e, and Œ until maybe ™48, and 
then we Œ we traveled fro
m one place to another place. In the middle of the night 
the Œ they brought big truck, military truc
k came up Œ came in, pulled me out of the 
bed, put hand on my  mouth a
nd said, don™t talk, be quiet
. And th ey took me and put 
me in that truck, and th ey told  me we going to
 Palestine.
 But meanwhile, I don™t Œ I 
don™t rememb er if they took other kids 
or not with them. It Œ I™m n o t really 
remember very well. 
But they took me and they Œ we 
went to different places, I do 
not know where, what. From one place to
 another place, again traveled thro ugh

Euro pe 
again, illegally, just like I did with 
my mother when my
 mother escaped 
from the ghetto and went and traveled, and 
somehow went back to  the city, I think 
to her husband. That™s why 
she returned back, because 
she couldn™t Œ nobody help 
her there and she couldn™t do 
nothing. So she had to retu
rn back. But she Œ I was in 
Belgium
 before, and 
France
 and other countries, and so
mehow we return back to 
Poland.
 I mean, that™s when my
 mother was still alive. 
This time I was moving 
from one co untry to  another country. And 
the paper, according to the paper, they 
put me on th e ship 
Sylv ania
(ph), and they  Œ we Œ to 
Palestine.
 In the boat, I had a 
friend, the name 
Natala
(ph), and she is in 
Israel
 today. And she was in my  children 
home too, because I visited 
Israe l
 in 2004, and we see that we 
[indecipherable]
 
together, 
Na ta la
(ph) and me. And on the boat, I do 
not know Œ th e British caught us 
on the boat when we were close to 
Palestine
 Œ everybody was so happy Œ the 
British caught us and arrested 
us and put us in a prison. So, I think I was about six 
year old at that time, 
I became a prisoner of 
United Kingdom
. And I don™t know 
how long we were, but in a prison for lo
ng time. I was freezing, was not much Œ I 
remember they put fences there, a
nd we were sleeping in a tent in 
Israel
 because 
there was not enough space, and Œ and it 
was very cold and freezing, and not 
enough food over there to Œ and, 
by th e way, on the boat to Œ to 
Israel
 was not 
enough food to eat also, and every day we 
ate only fish. And I hated fish so much 

 
Interview with Esther Fol 
 
 
November 8, 2008 
 

 
 
13
because all Œ every meal was only fish, too,
 there was no other food to eat, any 
more left. And that was very tough, and 
th at boat was also Œ people were, I think, 
Turkish, Arabs, Turkish were on that boa
t, too. And they wear the red hat that 
Turk ish wear, and I think th ey were Turk ish,
 and I used to be afraid of them so 
mu ch. And somebody was saying on th e boat th
at they stealing the kids, too. So I 
always frightened from th
em. Anyway, on th e way back
 in Œ back to Œ I mean
 
Palestine, 
and then  
Israel
 was declared as a state, I wa
s taken out of the prison and 
later on they send me to a foster family in
 Israel. 
And the name of the family, 
Goldschmid t
 
[indecipherable]
 
DDR [indecipherable] 
near
 Netanya
. And I had 
foster family, and that was Œ life was not 
easy beginning because I had Œ I had to 
get used to new Œ to a fam
ily life, which I never had fa
mily before. And a home I 
had never had before. And they  were 
very tough, they were Germans from 
Germany
. And Œ Jewish Germans, and they 
were very, very tough disciplinary 
people, and they discipline me with the Œ a 
lot of hitting. I got ag
ain a lot of hitting. 
And I did, again, pee-pee in the bed. And th
ey hit me for that al
so. And so the wa Œ 
life wasn™t easy. But then first grade I di
dn™t do good because in the school, first 
grade, I used all the time to dream about 
the fox who eated the kids, except me  not. 
So I couldn™t concentrate in the cl ass, 
and I was Œ I didn™t do good in school. So 
they decided I™m going to be left over, and 
take the class first grade again. So the

foster family said no, she cannot. I™m goi
ng to sit with her 
during the summer, and 
don™t leave her, because she has friends ther e now, and she used to them. And this 
will be a crime for her to Œ 
to move to new fr Œ kids, a
nd again the same class. S o  
my foster mother sat 
with me every day, teach me ma
th and teach me to read and 
write, and believe me on th at
, by the end of the summer I 
took a test for the first 
grade, I passed it. Second grade I beca
me the best student in the class. 

Q: That™s fantastic. 
A: Yeah. And from then on I became very, 
very good student, an
d I focus on school 
very mu ch . When  I became a Œ wh en I became a Œ a 10 year old Œ so far they knew 
my  n ame was 
Esther Pajewski
(ph), but they Œ they did 
not know anything about 
my family, and they though
t everybody died during th
e war, for me. And I took 
their name, their name was
 Goldschmidt.
 The father name was 
Elie Goldschmidt, 
and the mother name was
 Sho sha nna  Go ldschmidt
. Both were from 
Berlin,
 
Germany
. They immigrated to 
Israel 
in 1939, but th
ey lost all th
eir family in 
Germany
. In 1939 they still were
 able to immigrate to 
Israel
, and that™s why they 
survived, this 
family. And in 
Israel
 they worked 
in agriculture
. 
The Œ and they  had 
a house there, and it was a nice village, I Œ the life Œ and they were very, very 
disciplinary people. Everything had to be 
ju st right. Everything on time exactly, and 
I got used to all this. If I came five minut
es late, was almost like a crime, how you 

 
Interview with Esther Fol 
 
 
November 8, 2008 
 

 
 
15
did such  a thing? You have to be
 exactly by 12 o™clock for lunch 
[indeciphera ble]
 
exactly. Well, I got used to all this, a
nd that was very nice. But then I had 
something happen at the age 10
. I got sick, and they took 
me to the hospital to take 
x-rays, something happen. And the doctor ov
er there say, you kn
ow what? There™s a 
doctor by the name Dr. 
Pajewski
(ph). Maybe he™ll relate to
 this, because my last 
name 
Pajewski
(ph) was. And they  say, well, the 
do Œ the doctor in that hospital in 
Netanya
 say, you know what? We™ll come talk to
 him, and see if he related to her. 
A Œ after Œ within short time, Dr. 
Pajewski
(ph) come with a 
Jeep
 to the village, and 
they Œ he wanted to see 
Sonja Pajewski
(ph), which is me. And he came and found 
out that we are family members. 
And then  he contacted my  uncle in
 Italy
, the 
brother of my  father was station Œ was in
 Italy
 at the time. And I think it was 1950. 
And Œ 1950, and then  I got a letter from
 Italy Œ
 they got a letter from 
Italy
, and th at 
was written in Italian. And, that he, my unc
le, and he™s happy that I™m alive, an d all 
that. And then sunny Œ one day came somebody from 
United States, 
a man, that he 
say he my  uncle Œ he Œ 
I have an  uncle here, a
nd he is Œ his name is 
Isaac 
Ma ko wski
(ph), a brother of my  mo ther, and he 
want to meet me. And he came to 
see how I am, and to meet me finally. Not 
my  uncle, but he send  somebody else to 
meet me th ere. And tha Œ to Œ to see I™m a
live, he found out that I™m alive. That™s 
happen after the accident with
 the Œ that Œ th-the Dr. 
Pajewski
(ph). So, they

discover I have family memb ers. Now b
ecame another problem. My uncle in Œ 
Isa a c  Ma ko wski
(ph), who lives in Œ who at that time liv ed in
 Brooklyn
, 
New 
York
, in
 
Un ited States, he was not happy with th
e family that I was living, because 
they were not religious Jewish. They were
 nice people, Jewish, but they were not 
Orthodox like he was. He was Hassidi
c Orthodox Jew. So he contacted 
[indecipherable]
 my  uncle, my  other uncle, and Œ 
and he ask him to sign th at my  
parents were Orthodox, and they  wanted me 
to be Orthodox. So 
my case b eca me in  
a court, in Israeli court, and it took long tim
e in Israeli court, and finally the Israeli 
court decided that I have to be re
moved fo r religious reason from Œ from 
Goldschmid t,
 from my foster family. So, after liv
ing in the house four and a half 
years, I was ordered by the court to remove, if not the ca Œ the fa-family would be 

arrested. So the family had to give me up,
 and they put me in
 a Œ in a Orthodox 
board ing school in 
Israel, 
and that was in a Œ and I™m thinking a la Œ not 
Rama t 
Gan, 
that™s was in 
Benai Brak
, very religious place, and they send me to a 
religious school there, public school, a relig
ious public school there, and to learn the 
religion. Well, my uncle aimed to bring me to 
United States, 
that was in 1953. And 
I refused to come to 
United States 
at the time because I hated him for doing wh at 
he did. So th at came another fami ly, and th
ey told me that my uncle died, and they 
wanted to  bring me to their house, to give me a home. I do not know who they

were. And that family had twins. Babies, tw
o ba Œ twins, and I do not know. I found 
out later on that Œ that my  uncle just send me
 a letter, that couldn't b e that he died. 
So, it didn™t work
 out. But then 
[indeciphera ble]
 so it didn™t work out that way. 
And then  I moved to  
Ra ma t Ga n
, that™s another relig
ious boarding school

. 
Ra ™a na na  
in
 Ra™anana
 Œ 
Ra™a nana

Kfar Batya, 
Ra ™a na na
. That™s a boarding school that I liv
ed there, a elementary school, I was 
there a few years until 19 Œ until 
my first year Œ I finished there my first year h igh 
school, and then I asked to be mo
ved to kibbutz. I went to Kibbutz 
Yavne
, that™s a 
religious school, high school, my  
second year high school in 
Israel, 
and I wasn ™t 
happy there. I didn™t like the place. So Œ ki
bbutz life, whatever it was. So I took a 
test and I got into a school, for lab t
echnician  school. That™s a high school 
combination with a profession with a lab. So
 we had fo ur year Œ four hours a day, 
five days a week laboratory, and the 
rest is a Œ mainly was concentrate on 
chemistry. That™s how I started my 
[indecipherable]
 learning chemistry. Well, it 
started in high school. I was very good in 
math and sciences. And that™s due to my  
foster family, maybe, they taught me the Œ 
when my foster moth
er was sitting with 
me every day to teach me, when I was livi
ng in their house, and that™s how I got 
good in all these areas. I now focus a lo
t on school now, no mo re Œ I didn™t have 
nothing else to focus on, so it was school. I 
was a very good stud

year in Œ in the Kibbutz 
Yavne
. And then I went to 
Ra ma t Ga n
, to another family, 
a family that was also 
Holocaust survivor from 
Hungary
, I forgot the names. And 
they had the number on their hand. Sh e wa
s one of that that made experiment on 
her, that doctor Œ 
Q: 
Mengele
? 
A: 
Mengele
, he made experiment on her so sh
e could never have children. Now, 
her sister had five children, and wh en he
r sister had the sixth one, and she bought 
some Œ a nice outfit for the baby, she used to
 tell me, this, I don™t want to leave it to 
my sis. I really want Œ I™m thinking maybe
 I could have another chi Œ maybe I could 
have a child one day. I would like to ha
ve it for my child. But, that™s how the 
reality. I felt sorry for her. 
But anyhow, I lived in the hou
se, and I went to the lab 
technician school in 
Ra ma t Ga n
 every day. And wh en I fi
nished school, two years 
was, I got a job in Œ in
 Israel
, in the 
Weizmann

there two years in 
Israel,
 and after two years Œ after two years in 
Rehovot

not know Œ they did not kn

know how they look, but 
somehow we met. I d id tell them what I™m goi
ng to wear, so they™
ll look for a gi Œ a 
girl tha-that wearing so and so clothes, 
and tha Œ this, and special for them I would 
dress up in clothes so they can reco gn
ize it, not clothes li-like other people, 
otherwise they will never know who I am 
Œ where I am, right? So we met, and th-
they Œ I went to their house. I stay in 
the house for two months, and we didn't get 
along, they were too religious, Hassidic.
 And I Œ they found out that I™m not 
religious 
[indeciphera ble]
. So  they didn™t want to see me, and Œ and th ey wanted 
me to move out of the house, and to Œ they
 will rent for me a r
oom in a family, and 
I™ll leave th em, and they™ll pay for it. And at
 that time I was already 20 year old. I 
didn™t want it, so they decided to  send me to 
Michigan
, to my uncle who was 
married to Italian woman, not Jewish, but
 she converted, she became Jewish, and it 
Œ they™re not religious, so it would 
be good for me. So I went to 
Detroit, Michigan
, 
and I went to a Œ I went to a 
midrasha 
to become Hebrew teacher while I was there 
in the house. But I didn™t ge
t along again with my uncle, 
Max Pajewski

stayed very short time with 
them, and then  I contact w
ith the Jewish
 agency, and 
they found me a woma n that wants somebod
y to have co mp anionship at night only, 
for a free room and board. I say, I™ll take th
at deal. No pay, free room and board. So 
I live with that woma

Paul Cohen
, and I met him, and we 
got married a-at the same day when 
John F. Kennedy
 was shot. Civil marriage, not 
Jewish marriage. And at the same time, th

ed I w ent to the car, and suddenly I™m 
listening to the news, and I say, oh my  God,

job, I worked as a Œ as a lab technician in

 And then  Œ but the ma

my  husband was abusive husban d, and I had to leave him quick, because he didn't 

treat me rig h t. So I Œ I 
left him, and moved to 
New York. 
From

got this information from my uncle,
 Isa a c Ma ko wski

to
 Slonim ,

ask her to write me a letter. She gave her 
address. So he, when he came back to 
United States, 
he send me a letter and he told me 
she ask ed to write her. So I start 
to correspond with her, and in
 1999, I Œ I wrote her a lett
er, I™m coming to unite Œ to 
Belarus
 to meet you. So, we Œ th
ere™s a person by the name 
Jakob Œ
 he™s living in  
United States, 
Russian, that he is Œ he Œ he clai
med that he is a president of the 
Belarusian 
jewelry Œ Jewry. The Jew Œ all right. So
 he helped a lot 
of things to do 
with the cemetery of Œ of the Jewish cemet

cemeteries and other thing. So  I got 
in touch with him, he lives in 
Brooklyn.
 I got 
in touch with him, and we arranged for me to go th ere. I went to 
Bela rus
, I said, 
when you go to 
Bela rus

Belarus
, and which 
I did, and he arranged for me to be on 
TV 
in
 Belarus

Belarus
 to meet
 Helen a  Westerly,
 that she saved my  life during the war, etcetera. 
And so we had Œ we been co
rresponding ever since, and is a Œ I remember th at 
woman when I was young, the same face, 
she was a very fat woman. Now she was 
very fat. And sh e seemed to be that her face, the Œ the features similar to what she 
was at the time, because of the fat that she 
had in her face now. And they Œ I ni Œ all 
these years, I had somebody 
in my neighborhood look like that face, and I used to 
look at her. Every time she pass by, I woul
d sen Œ and stop and ju st stare at that 
woman. And then I start to understand wh
y I did. I knew somebody by th at Œ by Œ 
that looked like her. And 
Helena Westerly
, and we became goo
d friends. I look at 
her like somebody important to me, that was important because she did visit at me, 
not every day, was too dangerous during 
the war, while it was in a children home 
there, in 
Slonim
. But, very occasionally. It was t
oo dangerous to come, otherwise, 
they will be suspicious
 that she knows me. 
Q: When  you Œ wh en you m-met Miss 
Westerly
, could she provide you with  one 
more detail Œ 
A: Oh, she did. 

Q: Œ of your background stor
y, your mo th er, your back ground, where you said, this 
is wonderful Œ 

A: She did.

Q: Œ that I could learn this Œ 
A: She did. 

Q: Œ after all. After all these years. 
A: She did tell me about Œ I spoke some
 German, I knew German from the foster 
family because they spoke 
German. And Œ but my German
 was not that good. But I 
learn Russian by myself, before I went to
 Bela rus
, because I know eastern
 Europe, 
they™re all speaking Russian, so
 what I need to learn Polish? Polish I forgot already, 
when I lived in 
Israel. 
And when I went to 
Belarus
, I found out that everybody 
there speak Russian. So I was very pleased th
at I learned Russian. I was able to read 
and write Russian, but not much
, because just Œ I learn a little bit fo r myself to get 
along, just to be able to move around, so I could 
[indecipherable] 
different thing, 
but not a lot. So with th e Ru ssian and th
e German, we were able to communicate. 
Meanwhile, there™s a Œ  was a Œ a woman there,
 a Œ a Œ a daughter of her friend, that 
she major in English in 
Belaru s
, and she became interpreter. 
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: So, that cost me plenty
 of money to do interprete
r, believe me, th ey all want 
money. They all take opportunity to do th at
. But that™s okay, it didn™t matter to me. 
I was very happy, so she to Œ I had also a 
lot of thing translated
 Œ I mean, a lot of 
thing on the tape in Polish, on the tape I ha
ve that Œ that she sp
oke. Now, she died

March 2008, unfortunately, and she never 
met my  daughter. I wanted to bring my  
daughter there, and she died, it™s too late. But Œ 
Q: Did she tell you something Œ was there Œ 
do you rememb er some things she told 
you, wh ere you said, oh, thank you s Œ 

A: She explained me certain things, yes Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ she did. Wh en I told her that the 
Œ the kids were shot and not me, and she 
explaining what™s happen. The 
kids were Jewish who were
 circumcised, that™s how 
they know that they™re 
Jewish. I was a girl 
[in d ecipherable]
. She did say I did have 
Œ I was 
[indecipherable]
 headache a lot, because I did have malnutrition. I suffered 
from very severe malnutrition, she say. I look so bad, so when  my  uncle came to 

pick me up, he Œ she say he Œ it was like 
seein g  a ghost, that™s how bad I looked. 
But basically Œ and when I was a Œ a Œ 
now, what I™m doing now, I™m semi-retired 
from my full time job, and I teach in colle
ge part time chemistry, and I have a 
daughter who is now 29 year old, from Mr. 
Fol, 
not from Mr.
 Cohen
. Mr. 
Cohen
 
did Œ never had children. Basically, that™s 
what it is. And I came to the conference 
here to meet Œ maybe to meet some people
, to see what is the conference. But I™m 
still working, teaching in college part 
time. A nd I just lost my husband, Mr. 
Fol
 a 
year ago. And so  right now I™m alone, and 
I™m Œ I lost my best friend, I Œ he was

my best friend really, my husband, 
Ralph Fol.
 He was original Œ
 Ralp h Fol,
 my  
husband, he was from 
Russia
, he was born in 
Russia
 in 1916. In 19
17, his father, 
Ike Fol, 
his name was 
Folchu k
(ph), he escaped from Ru ssian revolution in  1917, 
he came to 
United States, 
and he was unable to get a job as I Œ 
Ike  Folchuk
. So he 
cut Œ he split his name to 
Fol
, and that™s where the name become 
Fol, f-o-l.  
Q: Ah. 
A: Now you know. Because nobody wanted
 to hire somebody who come from 
Russia
 
[indecipherable]
 and they call him Russian
 communist, with the name
 
Folchu k
(ph). So that™s why he did. 
Q: That™s interesting. I had one more que
stion ab out Œ I™m just thinking about your 
being on the ship and going to  
Palestine Œ 
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: Œ back  then. So  your uncle was with

27
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And the family told me this wa
y. We have the same last name, 
Pajewski
(ph). 
But always reme mb er, you are not our da
ughter. And th ey went with me to 
Palestine
, and then, after the British arrested
 us and all that, I never saw them 
again. So  I do not know who was that fa
mily , where they went to and who they 
were, and I would be happy to find out. Wh
at I™d like to know 
from all this, I w ant 
to know who were the passengers on 
[indecipherable]
 boat, and tell me 
information about these passengers. I would 
like to know if somebody that knew 
who I was, and Œ and my  journey from 
Lo-Lódz Œ Ló dz
 to
 Palestine
, what year, or 
when did I left children home in 
Lo-Lódz Œ Lódz
 is actually 
Lódz, Lódz, Poland
, 
and Œ and how I traveled to go to 
Palestine. 
And I want to know also, I™d like to get 
also, information about th
e Œ the Œ the court order about removing me from 

Goldschmid t
, my foster family, and 
by the way, I™m still in
 touch with my  foster 
family. Their parents died, but I™m in touch with their son,
 Suri
(ph) 
Goldschmidt
, 
he is like my brother, I look at 
him as my  brother, and his sister, 
Newey
(ph)
 
Goldschmid t,
 she died about a month and a half ago. They called me up and they 

told me she died. And that™s 
basically what is told, and Œ 
Q: There was no further family, so your mo
ther was Œ apparently
 you were the only 
child. Your father died very early. 

 
Interview with Esther Fol

A: I was the only chil-child, yeah. 
Q: So there was no further fa Œ 

A: The whole family wiped out. 
Q: Yeah.  
A: The-They killed the whol
e family. There™s one Dr. 
Pajews ki
(ph). He is a 
relative, he is not very close 
family, he is a relative. I don™
t bother with the family at 
all. We had a lot of feud in the family because what™s happened, taking me from 
Goldschmid t.
 So it became a feud in the family because of that. So one side don™t 
like another side because of that. So Œ 
and I™m in between, so I™m Œ neither one 
good friend with me, and this
 is how th e family ended. 
And, unfortunately, that™s 
what™s happened. And Œ 

Q: It™s interesting, if you 
th ink of it being a child with  a strange family on a trip, 
leaving your country, going to 
Palestine
, I wa Œ 
A: I don™t know who they were. 
Q: Do you have any 
Œ any memo ry wh at the ship wa
s like, what Œ what was life on 
the ship. 
A: It was a very big ship, oh yeah. 
Q: You s Œ you said you had nothing to  eat
, it was fish. How would you prep are the 
food? Was it raw fish, was there any Œ 

 
Interview with Esther Fol

29
A: They Œ I did no
t know what Œ oh Œ 
Q: Did you have any devices to prepare the food? 
A: They Œ they pr
epared the food there, a
nd ev ery meal was only fish. 
Q: Fish, raw f Œ did you Œ 

A: And I Œ for many years I wouldn™t touch fish. 

Q: Yeah, I can imagine. 

A: For many years, if you sh owed me fish
, I would run away from it. Because fish 
is one thing, I hated that. And just the word  fish is Œ was enough to  hate, be-because 

o-of all this. But anyhow, one thing I reme
mb er on that boat was, there was a Œ like 
a Œ a big place with water, and they used to
 go and threw in the Œ with a net, some 
people to the water. And I didn™t understa
nd what ed Œ why, and wh at does it mean? 
So some people Œ now people tell me
 could be people who came from a 

concentration camp were afraid to takeshower because a Œ a Œ they were taking 

shower in the gas, and they 
got killed in concentration ca
mp. So people were afraid 
to take shower because they 
were thinking that™s what 
happen again. So maybe they 
threw them to Œ they forced 
them to wash themself, to 
throw them to the water. So, 
I do not know, I™m just telling you wh at I 
sa w. But life on the boat, I had one good 
friend on the boat, 
Na ta la
(ph). She came with me to
 Isr ael
. She was in 
[indecipherable]
 also, 
Nata la
(ph), and that™s all that I know of. But she was a little

bit older than me. And that™s how it is, but I went back  to
 Slonim
, and I went also to 
Pola nd . 
I went into the archives of the Jewi
sh History Museum, and th ey got my  
pictures in the archive, 
and on th e picture is say, 
Sonja Pajewski
(ph), in Yiddish. 
So I™m happy, I ha Œ that™s the first time 
I have pictures from Œ that I™m a Œ little. 
Q: Oh, this is fantastic. One cannot Œ I 
can™t even imagine how it must be, to be, 
you know, on a ship  in a strange 
world, being on this long trip. 
A: But I so got used to move 
from one place to another place. 
Q: To the ‚nothers, yeah. 
A: Yeah. But one thing I™m lu
cky I had the family, because when  I arrived to pa Œ 
to my foster family, how tough they we
re beginning, and I was very fortunate, 
because they Œ yeah, I was 
afraid beginning, because th
e Palestinians would come 
to Œ to the village. We lived in 
Kfar Yedidya
 next to 
Netanya.
 And they would 
come at night, the Palestinians, to the 
village and steal cows, and do all time 
sabotage in a lot of thing. So I would be 
so afraid. They would 
send me at Œ in the 
evening, purposely in  the evening, to br
ing newspaper from the neighbor, because 
at that time people didn™t have money,
 and they share a newspaper bet-between 
three, four different families. So one fam
ily read the German newspaper Œ the Œ the 
newspaper was in German. So, the all Œ 
the Œ the village were all come from 
Germany
. They all either
 Austria
 or 
Germany
, but they all were German origin 

 
Interview with Esther Fol

and they all spoke German. And I didn't
 speak German. I felt very bad that I 
couldn™t catch the language. And they trie
d to teach me and I couldn™t catch the 
language. I couldn™t learn one set from the 
a Œ Po lish language became th Œ and I 
know only 
[indecipherable]
. Language became very diffi
cult for me to learn. And 
this was my problem, language. And they  Œ 
they would send me to
 the library, th Œ 
the family had the books in 
German, and they will say, 
you have to bring a book, 
and they would teach me how to say it in 
German. And by the time I get there, and I 
said book. And I had difficulty say th-the re
st of it. So they knew that I have to 
bring a book for them, and that™s how it was.
 But I got used to all this, but when I 

came to 
Isr a el
, they have the Œ I remember I wa
s with my friends, the neighbors 
were my friends, and they we
re the same age I was, and 
they Œ the plan was, that 
time, I think, after the war of ™48, or 
whatever, I do not know
, the plans was there 
from the 
[indeciphera ble]

families in that villa

here they responded to him, th
at he had a good family in

woods.

generation, so they know th
at there was a Holocaust, whoever deny the Holo caust, 
they hate 
Israel
, and the one destru ction of 
Israel
. That the hol Œ that the Holocaust 
Œ I believe the Holo caust Œ the purpose of 
the Holo caust was to 
create the state of
 
Israel
, because that™s how the state of 
Israel  
was created. That™s what I believe.
