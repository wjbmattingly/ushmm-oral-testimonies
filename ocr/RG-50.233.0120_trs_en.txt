Interview with Charlene  Schiff  
March 2, 1993 
Alexandria, Vi rginia 
 
A: My name  is Charlene Schiff.  I was born in Horochow, Poland, December 16, 1929.   

 

Q: Can you tell me  your name  then?   

 

A: Yeah, my Hebrew name was Sulamit 
Perlmutter and my nickname was Musia. 
 

Q: Musch?  

 

A: No,Musia. 

 

Q: Oh, Musia, okay. And Horochow? 

 

A: Horochow. 

 

Q: Horochow. That™s  right outside Lvov? 

 

A: It™s  about an hour ™s  drive fr
om Lvov.  It™s a small town. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  a little bit 
about growing up in the town? 
 

A: Ye s, I can tell you all my  wonderful me mories
.  I had an idyllic childhood.  I was surrounded by 
love.  I had two wonderful parents and one older si
ster.  She was four years older than I. We  
had a very good relationship.  My parents wereboth educators.  My father was a university 

professor in Lvov. 
 

Q: What was your father ™s  name ?  

 

A: Sime on.  Si mc ha, Si me on, 
Simeon Perlmutter,Simeon. 

 

Q: And he was a university professor in Lvov? 

 

A: Yes.That was a state university. 

 

Q: What did he teach? 

 

A: Philosophy.  My mother did mot teach but both of
 them were civic leaders in town and I would 
like to bring out the fact that they were leader
s not just for the Jewish
 community but for the 
entire town as well.Wh at hurts so now in retr
ospect is that when we needed help no one 
extended a helping hand to us.  Our neighbors and 
for mer so-called friends turned against us. 
My childhood was very, very happy.  I know my 
father had five sisters and a mother who 
emigrated toAmerica and he was in I guess, in th
e process of arranging for us to join them in 
the United St ates when the war broke out.  I don™t
 know why he was the last one to emigrate but 
I understand from -- also in retrospect that it 
was because these were women, sisters, and he 
decided he would take care of them first ev
en though he was some how in the mi ddle.  I don™t 
know the actual chronologi
cal years but unfortunately we neve
r ma de it.  Ironically in 1939 he 

was offered two tickets, two invitations to theWo
rld™s Fair in NewYork and he refused.  He 
asked for four and of course they didn™t give him 
four so we never did make it or he never ma de 
it.  My childhood was very, very happy.  I reme mber a big house.  Our house was alwa ys filled 
with people.  In those days or 
at that time we™d have like meeti
ngs and concerts, 
poetry reading. 
 

Q: At your house? 

 

A: Yeah and all these ma ny students of his woul
d come  and it was a very happy house, home , and I 
think that™s what gave me strength to surv
ive in a way because  I did have  a very solid 

background of love and security. 
 

Q: When did you start going to school? 

 

A: Well, my father was a believe
r in education, obviously, and we 
had tutors from the time I was 
four years of age and that™s  when we started 
and then I guess to regul
ar school I started at 
around six. 
 

Q: You went to public school? 

 

A: Ye s, I went to public school but we still had 
private tutors for Latin and for German and piano 
music. 
 

Q: So you knew four languages then? 

 

A: No I really didn™t.  I was not a student.  I wa
s mor e  of a tomboy.  My sister was very musically 
inclined.  She played the piano, 
she played the violin beautifully
 and she continued.  I played 
the piano but I really didn™t  give
 it any of my soul  or anything.
  I liked to play and run around 
and just do the norma l things. 
 

Q: You said you were a tomboy. What did you me an by that? 

 

A: Oh I would climb trees and do that sort of stuff. 

 

Q: Around the town was there a lot of lake
s and streams and things to play with? 
 

A: No, there was a river and I reme mber once, as 
a ma tter of fac t  on my fourth birthday there was a 
party and at that time, it™s very 
hazy, but we did not live in a bi
g house on the fashionable street.  
My father and I walked along the river, on the ba
nks of the river and that
 river played a very 
important role in my life.  I l
ooked over to the other side and I 
said, Papa is thatAmerica on the 
other side and he tried to expl
ain that it was not. There was on
e river. There were two ponds 
and there was a great big, it™s not a forest -- wh
at do you call -- like a park but filled with trees 
and all and that park or on the edge of the park lived a lady who owned an awful lot of land and 

she was the, like the (I don™t know what you woul
d call it -- the word escapes me  now) but she 

was fr om nobility, Polish nobility and she was 
like a princess. And sh
e lived, she was an old 
lady at that time ; she only had some  servants an
d all who tended her. But she lived right on the 

edge of that great big park a
nd it was like a palace. And then we had like a ma yor ™s house, the 
St arosta and all these people used to come  to 
our house, the ma yor, the Polish priest and the 
Ukrainian priest because our town was partly Poli
sh and partly Ukrainian and partly Jewish.  In 
our house everyone me t on an even status and it 
was very interesting.  I mean I took it for 

granted. My friends were Polish, Ukrainian, Jewi
sh, and I really even though you™re not asking 
me, I never felt any anti-Se mitism in my childhood.There probably was so me but I never felt it 
personally. And when I think of it now it was probably no small achieveme nt that my father 

was a professor at a state university as a Jew a
nd to me  it was a given. That™s the way it went 
on.  My mot her did an awful lot of philanthr
opic work in our town and I reme mber they 
organized camps in the summer time for nee
dy children, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian and there 
was always an awful lot of activity and it wa
s a very happy home .  I me a n there were ma ny 

things. You talk about being a tomboy. I was the 
bane of my sister ™s ex
istence.  She was four 
years older and I always wanted to do what she 
did.  Of course she resented it.  One time we 
had they call it a fretepian so 
it™s not really a piano I guess but 
some thing like a piano in a salon, 
in the living room. One time I got hold of some pa
int and I painted the keys
.  I was punished for 
that but I did it so she wouldn™t be able to pl
ay. Those are the things
 I reme mber from my 
childhood. 
 

Q: How large was the town approxima tely? 

 

A: Twenty, thirty thousand, just about that. 

 

Q: So it was a good size town.  It wasn™t  a small town? 

 

A: It was a small town, yeah, but it was a very typi cal shtetl as they call it. 

 

Q: Wa s there a large Jewish community there? 

 

A: Ye s very large and very active, large, I 
don™t know probably several 
thousand Jews and there 
was a Jewish day school they called `Tarbut and th
ere was a society, I gu
ess, the Kahila that 
governed the Jewish community. There were se
veral different synagogues. There was a rabbi 
and that™s  it.  
 

Q: We re your parents religious? 

 

A: They were traditional but they were quote emancipated unquote. They were not very religious, 
they were traditional.  I knew who I was, I kne
w my identity. We  observed all the holidays and 
that™s another thing I reme mber.  Onc e  before Pa
ssover I was given a little St ar of David and a 
gold chain and I lost the St ar of
 David and there were about twen
ty people at the table and this 
is like a big dinner at Passover and everybody was 
ma de to crawl on the fl oor to find my little 
St ar of David which they found.  But I don™t 
remember going to synagogue every Saturday.  
No, we didn™t do that. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  a little b
it about -- you know as much as
 you can reme mber -- about the 
invasion of Poland by the Germans in 1939? 
 

A: We ll before the Germans invaded my  town 
the Soviet Union took over because Poland was 
partitione d in two.The eastern pa rt of Poland b
ecame the property of the Soviet Union and we 
fell into that category.  So in 1939 when the 
war started September 1, 1939, the Russians came 

in. They came in with their 
tanks and with thei r soldiers. 
 

Q: Did they come  in on the first or did they come  in a few weeks later? 

 

A: They came in ma ybe a week or so later and I 
remember long, long processions. At that time we 
lived in a big, big house on the ma in fashionable 
street. Litsa Miskawicha and I reme mber long 
hordes of refugees comi ng from the other part of
 Poland tryi ng to get away fr om the Germans 
and we didn™t understand what was going on. They
 came in with tanks a
nd with soldiers but 
very little bloodshed. There was a lot of chaos 
but pretty soon things became  again sort of 
norma l.  I personally did not realize what
 was going on. I knew there was a change of 
governme nt. The e mphasis in my life was that
 the language, the for mal language became  
Russian instead of Polish.  But again that was 
not much of a problem because in our area 

everyone was either bi or tri-lingua
l.  It was a little difficult in
 the beginning. A lot of people 
lost their jobs and all.  My father did not. Th
ey kept him on and he continued in Lvov. There 
was one change which I just realized a few days 
ago.  He used to also teach in Kracow, I don™t 
what do you call it, as a visiting professor and 
that stopped. Well it stopped obviously because 
the Germans took over.  But other than th
at our life did not change that much. 
 

Q: You stayed in the same  house? 

 

A: We  stayed in the same  house. You see we were
 not ma terialistically, we
 were not rich or we 
were not -- I guess my family was part of the in
tellect ual gr oup in the to
wn so our life has not 
changed mu ch. This went on for not quite two y
ears.  Our schools didn™t lose a beat. The only 

thing is that the official 
language changed into Russian. 
 

Q: We re you taught Russian in the schools? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And were the businesses in the to
wn nationalized, that kind of thing? 
 

A: We ll you know what was happening and again this is
 all in retrospect wh
ich I didn™t realize.  
Some  people would disappear in 
the mi ddle of the night and not 
be heard from again.And these 
were probably the people that they considered
 capitalists. These we
re business people who 
owned businesses. Ye s, I guess the businesses ch
anged hands so to speak and all of a sudden 

there was a shortage of one item, two items, thre
e items. Ye s, definitely, the whole picture of 

the town did change. 
 

Q: Can I back up just a little bit before the inva
sion?  Do you reme mber your father, your fa mily in 
general being concerned about the Germans co
mi ng to power, the Nazis comi ng to power and 
becomi ng more powerful? 
 

A: We ll, I don™t know. This was not discussed in fr
ont of me  but I know my father had a fantastic 
library in his little office in our house and now 
and again they would ha
ve meetings and they 
closed the door. A lot of people would come , a lo
t of his students and they would talk and then 
I would never see them again. And then I found th
at a lot of them e migrated in a clandestine 
way illega lly. And a lot of them ended up, ma ny 
as a ma tter of fact, ended up in what is now 
Israel and some  of the m ended up in the United 
St ates.And some  of the m we never heard of 
again.  But yes, there were ma ny di
scussions and there were concerns. 
 

Q: Now you said some thing about earlier when we
 spoke about trying to get out and go to the 
United St ates your father–.. 
 

A: Ye s,myfather–.. 
 

Q: When did he try to do this? 

 

A: We ll, it seems like all my life there was talk 
about it but I know that 
at one point, I don™t know 
exactly, I think it was 1938, we a
ll had to go toWa rsaw and be interviewed or some thing and 
this was part of the process of getting 
ready to emigrate to the United St ates. 
 

Q: But the papers just didn™t come  through before the invasion? 

 

A: I don™t know what happened but apparently so, unfortunately. 

 

Q: Wa s there anything, you know you 
talked about your life under the 
Soviets when they came in, I 
there anything else that stri
kes you about the Soviet rule 
about anything that you could 
reme mber that was very striking to you? 
 

A: We ll, I guess going to synagogue was a little more -- I mean it became less frequent.  It didn™t 
affect any of my i mme di ate friends so I am very
 hazy about it and I know that it was difficult 
and I know that they probably nationalized th
e businesses and all but 
from my own personal 
point of view I cannot re
late to it too much. 
 

Q: You ma de mention about the synagogue. Wa s 
there a conscious effort by the author ities to 
discourage religious practices? 
 

A: I don™t know, I™m sure it was but it was done in 
a very subtle way and I think my father was 
conscious of it and probably cognizant of it that
 he is not supposed to go to synagogue too 
often. 
 

Q: You said he was allowed to go to Lvov.  Do you 
reme mber if he was allowed to travel freely in 
that way back or forth? 
 

A: Yeah, he was traveling back and forth but
 I don™t think we traveled anyplace else. 

 

Q: Why don™t you tell me  a little bit about wh
en the Germans invaded the Soviet Union? 
 

A: We ll, that happened in the summer of ™41.Agai
n I guess Hitler and St alin, or Hitler decided to 
break his agreement with St alin and he st
arted pursuing his evil 
plans by occupying the 
territories first of Poland and then going on to 
Russia. The Germans came, again it™s almost 
like out of nowhere, again with ta
nks and their soldiers were mu
ch -- they were dressed sharp, 
they looked sharp. To me it was an event of change
, but in a way exciting.  
It™s  hard to say that 
but it was. They came in and we didn™t know wh
at to expect.  I know my  parents were very 
depressed but they di d not share these feelings wi
th us openly. Again we saw a lot of refugees, 
as we call them now, people going with the Ru
ssians. Why we didn™t do it, I don™t know.  I™m 
sure it™s very difficult to ma ke decisions 
like these when you have a family, when you™re on 
your own.  I want to track back and I think that my
 father was an ardent 
Zionist and I think that 
we didn™t go toAmerica for two reasons and this 
is my conjecture.  One, the authorities and the 

red tape was absolutely awful and took a long time
 and secondly my father ™s heart really didn™t 
belong there and yet being a fa mily ma n with 
two kids it was difficult for him to make a 

decision to do what he told his students to do and 
a lot of them did then. They went to Israel. 

 
Q: Do you think he was advocating for ma ny of them to leave? 

 

A: Oh, I know he did because we ma de a trip to 
Israel in 1985 (decade is unc
lear) or so and I met 
some  of his students. They organized an 
evening to honor the me mory of my parents, 

especially my father, their me ntor, and they told me  that. 
 

Q: Did they reme mber you? 

 

A: Yes, they reme mbered me as a little pain in th
e neck. Ye s, they did.And I reme mbered some  of 
them. Ye s, my father was really an ardent 
Zi onist.  I didn™t realize then, I didn™t know that. 
 

Q: Did you know much of his 
activities in that vein? 
 

A: No, I know he was preoccupied with education 
and all.  He had a numbe r of doctorates from 
different places and that was his 
life.  But the rest of it, no, I 
did not know.  He was a wonderful 
father, he wa s very stern. There was discipline.
 We  did not speak at the table until he spoke.  
But that was all right, we didn™t know any differen
t so that was okay.  I think I digressed from 
some thing that you asked. 
 

Q: No, that™s  okay. We  can get back to it.  I™ve 
got a couple of other questi
ons but I wanted to step 
back just a little bit.  I aske
d you about the invasion, the German invasion, but I wanted to step 

back just a little bit if I could.  Before when 
we talked about how your father had discussions 
with students and other people about Germans, 
the Nazis comi ng to power and that kind of 
thing. 
 
A: Ye s, I think so because ther
e were all sorts of newspapers 
and the radi os and the political 
situation was discussed constantly. 
 
Q: Do you, now this is an interesting questi on because ma ny pe ople at the time especially 
historians speculate that some  people in the Sovi
et Union ma y not have known or tried to play 
down the fact that the Ge rmans were going to invade.  Do you reme mber if your father was 

concerned about that? 
 

A: I don™t know.  I think he was always concerne
d with the world situation and they always, I 
mean at these discussi ons and these gatherings
 political  situations 
were always discussed 
whether it was a concert or 
poetry reading or so but yes 
it was always discussed. 
 

Q: When the invasion happened in June of ™41 
do you reme mbe r  how long it was after the invasion 
started that the Germans came into 
your town or arrive in the area? 
 

A: I would say within a week, 
not any longer than that. Ther
e wa s no bloodshed or anything.  
They just came in.  In the very beginning, I don™t know if it was the same  day they ma rched in 

or the next day, all the Jews, right away they 
zeroed in on the Jews, we had to meet at the 
ma rketplace and right away they started with thei
r decrees to strip us of
 all material possessions 
slowly but very systematically.The first request 
wa s for the Jews to give all the gold, maybe all 
the silver, all the radios, everything that had a
ny ma terial value, carpe
ts, Persian carpets, you 
wouldn™t imagine, furs, fur coats,
 all sorts of things we had to
 bring to the ma rketplace, or 
whatever, I think it was the ma rketplace, the Germ
ans took that. And that went on for about a 

week. Then they went around with a list of people
 which tells me that th
e local inhabitants had 
to give them that list. 
 
Q: Some body had to give them that list. 

 

A: That™s  right. They didn™t know the name s and th
ey went for specific me n.  These me n were all 
the leaders, the Jewish leaders in
 the community. And of course 
my father was one of them and 
they took him away.  Just like that. 
 

Q: And that was within the first week of them being there? 

 

A: Within the first week or ma ybe the very beginn
ing of the second week, th
at™s  it. There was so 
much chaos and so much confusion.  I don™t r
ecall but every day since the Germans came in 
was just like a nightma re in the beginning and th
at was not even the real nightma re.  But that™s  
the way I lost my father. They came  in.  He 
saw them; he tried to run out through the kitchen, 
through the back way and they were
 in the back there with the Uk
rainians and they grabbed him 
and that was that. The rumor had it that these 
people, the leaders of our community were taken 

away and sent to Dachau.  Now I find out that 
there was a big question ma rk.  Some  people told 
me  that it™s probable that they were all execute
d right there and there™
s supposed to be a ma ss 
grave which I never got to see upon my return trip in 1988.  Or some  of them did go to Dachau.  

I searched in Dachau for any sign, lists and all.  I 
could not find anything and I still to this day, I 
do not know how or when my father died. After 
they took away the leaders of our town which 
was a very organized pl an to just cause chaos 
and confusion once the leaders were gone. Then 

they, I don™t know the sequence, 
the chronological se
quence, but they bu
rnt all our synagogues 
and they gathered, we had to be ther
e to watch it, every Jewish person. 
 
Q: –was taken out to watch it. 
 

A: ..to watch it. They burned all our books of pr
ayer, ourTorahs, everything.And they did that in 
one day. Then we went home .  Everyone who was 
fourteen years or older 
was ordered to work.  
In the morning they would gather in a certain pl
ace, my sister and my mother.  I me an it was 
such a stupid, useless–.most of the work wa
s useless. My mother was digging ditches and 
things like that.  My sister at
 that point was also digging ditche
s. Then, after a little while, 
every day there were di ff erent decrees and diff
erent orders, loudspeakers.  Before the ghetto 

was organized, one day a van pulle
d up in front of our house and 
several Germans came  out and 
they came up to the house and asked where my fa
ther ™s  library was and my father had a rare 
collection of first edition books and I mean that 
was his life™s hobby (all the little money we had 
I think he spent on the rare 
books) and they knew about it.  How did they know about it?   
Somebody told them. 
 

Q: And these were Germans who came? 

 

A: Germans, yes. And they clean
ed out his library which was stac
ked.  My father ™s  library was a 
place where we had to wash our hands to go i
n. We  were not allowed to touch the books 
without his permission.  He really
 had a fantastic collection.  
But anyway they took it all, 
packed it in boxes. 
 

Q: This was after he had been taken way? 

 

A: Ye s, that was after he had been taken away.  
And they gave my mother a receipt . They thanked 
the gnaidika frau. They thanke
d her yet and they drive off. 
 
Q: At this point in time not long after the inva
sion do you reme mber if there was a differentiation 
between what we mi ght call like German soldiers
 and ma ybe Nazi troops, that kind of thing?   
Do you remember that at all? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: They were just German soldiers? 

 

A: They were just Germans to us. 

 

Q: Do you remember when the Germans actually cam
e into the town, were there people who were 
happy to see them and not just because they were
 fascists but maybe against the communists or  
that kind..? 
 

A: Oh yes, they were greeting them with flowers, yes. 

 

Q: There were a lot of people in town doing this? 

 

A: Oh yes, they were lining the 
streets with flowers and applaudi
ng, yes. Then after another few 
days there was an announcement in the mi ddle 
of the day. That day nobody went to work 
because every day my sister and my mother were told to meet at six o™ cloc k in the morning to 

go to work and they would be herded back in 
the evening. That day no work.  I don™t reme mber 

but in the morning, ma ybe ten or eleven o™
clock there were loudspeakers going around and 
announcing the fact that we have 
to meet in the marketplace with
in an hour and we can take 
with us what we want to take, what we  can carry
 with us and that™s  wh
at we did. We  grabbed 
whatever we could. 
 

Q: Do you remember what you took? 

 

A: Ye s, I reme mber what I took.  I also reme mber
 that my mothe r  had enough foresight that we 
had some  gold coins and a few rings.  I mean not
 much because we were not a family that was 
very ma terialistic.  But she sewed into our clot
hing and to each my sist
er and myself and her 
own clothing some  of the jewelry into the linings. 
 She said you never know. This is for a rainy 
day. And so we grabbed the clothing, the coat
s and whatever.  I don™t remember what else we 
grabbed but some  pillows and blankets
 and we went to the marketpl ace. 
 

Q: And that was in the center of the town? 

 

A: Ye s, and there we were ma rched into a very poo
r section of the city, of
 the little town and we 
were assigned a place to live.  Our place was one room and we shared it with three ot her 

fa milies.  Mostly there were women and older 
me n because the leaders were taken away, about 

three hundred of them or  so. And that™s th
e way the ghetto was for med. The ghetto was 
surrounded by a high fence that was finished off with
 barbed wire and there were two gates, one 
in the front and one in the back.  Everyone who 
entered had to have a written permit.  In the 
morning the people who worked were ma rched out
 and they were ma rched back in in the 
evening. The place was guarded by Ukrainian mili
tia. There were very few Ger mans in the 

ghetto. They were on the outside mo stly. That™s
 when our nightma re really began.The rations 
were very meager but if on didn™t work, there 
was no ration.  So I did 
not receive a ration and 
my mother and my sister had to share.  I mean 
they didn™t have to but they shared their rations 
with me . In the beginning people still ma naged not 
to give  all their ma terial possessions to the 
Germans so there were some opportu
nities to barter on the outsid
e and bring in some  milk and 
bread and what have you. And that™s  the way we
 survived.  My mother and a few other of the 
wome n organized a clandestine school for children like myself because we  were really left with 
no supervision and nothing to do and they ma na
ged to get some  school supplies from the 
outside by trading rings or gold 
or whatever people had.  So 
for a while we had a wonderful 
school in the evening in the ghetto. We , I mean 
kids, really looked forward to it. They read 
books and we sang songs and we colored and did all 
sorts of little stupid 
things just to occupy 
our mi nds but it was very good for us.  But it did 
not last very long. After a few months that 
sort of dissipated and it disappe
ared because people didn™t have 
any more to trade for supplies 
plus the fact that wint er set in and there was 
a lot of cold and illness and st arvation and mostly 

everyone was just concentrating on being able to 
survive.  In the ghetto we were ordered to 
wear a St ar of David, a yellow patch, on the fr ont of our clothing and on the back of our 

clothing.  Even within the ghetto you couldn™t m
ove without having that 
patch.  It was a very 
difficult thing and even as young as I was I reali
zed that we were separated from the rest of 
humankind because we were different. We were
 not as good as anybody else. And that™s a very 
demoralizing thing to live with. 
 Most of all I think we were
 preoccupied with being hungry. 
Hunger is some thing very hard to describe.  It
™s so paradoxical now.  Everyone is on diets and 
we say we mustn™t eat so much, cholesterol, what
 have you.  But real hunger is so painful.  It 
absorbs or it takes over your 
entire being.  I don™t reme mber 
what I ate yesterday but those 
years are etched in my memory. The y were inde
lible.  I reme mber I was so hungry that I would 
do anything to get some thing to eat.  So ma
ny times even though I promised my mother I 
wouldn™t do it, I would sneak out of the ghetto. 
 

Q: Did a lot of people do that? 

 

A: Many of the children did it because my age or even younger, the ones who didn™t work, there 
was nothing to do all day long and all you could 
think of is how hungry you were. And so we 
did. We  had an ingenious, as a ma tter of fact
 two places in the ghetto where we dug holes and 

camouflaged them and that was not through the ga tes so we would go out, sneak out and try and 

beg or barter for some  food and th
en we™d go back the same  way. 
 It was difficult and we were 
very obvious. We  were recognized that we we
re not the same  as the people on the outside 

because our clothi ng and we were dirty and we 
were unkempt and all that but we didn™t care, 

we were so hungry. And some  people on the outs
ide, I say the outside, the Ukrainians and the 
Poles were good to us.  Others 
were not.  If you were caught on 
the outside it was punishable by 
death.  I did it a lot of times and I was not caugh
t.  I™d bring an egg home  to share with my 
fa mily.  I would bring a slice of bread or so
me thing like that.  One time I did go out and I 

ma naged to get two eggs for a little ring and I got
 it out of my clothing and I was getting back 
and I was almost at the place where I would crawl 
in the hole and get back and this Ukrainian 
militia man caught me.  He started yelling at me
 and he searched me . I had a dress with puff 

sleeves and I put one here a
nd one in here. He found the eggs and he threw them on t he 
sidewalk and ma de me  kneel down and rub my face 
in the eggs and screamed
 at me and said get 
back where you belong and I don™t want to hear
 from you a nymore, I don™t want to see you 
anymore.  So I guess he was a gentle person because
 he could have killed me .  He didn™t.  But I 
didn™t give  away the hiding place either.  He ma rched me  to the gate and pushed me  in and that 

was it.  I had scrapes on my face and whatever 
but that didn™t  count. A few days later as a 

ma tter of fac t  a dear friend of mi ne, she was about 
eleven a little older than
 I at that point, and 
she went out and she got a loaf of bread and she 
never ma de it back to the ghetto and they shot 
her right on the spot and they 
dragged her body right into the 
ghetto and they wouldn™t allow 
the burial committee, because they ha d a commit t
ee for that, they wouldn™t allow them to bury 
her for a week. 
 
Q: As a warning? 

 

A: Ye s, there we re so ma ny not warnings but I m
ean sadistic things.  One time, I me an I could go 
on for days, one time there were three fellows who ma de their way from work, young fellows as 

a ma tter of fact, and they trie
d to escape. And they caught 
them, three young fellows, I knew 
one of them, I didn™t know the other two and they 
gathered us, the ma rket wasn™t  part of the 
ghetto, and they ma de us  watch when they hung th
em, three and then they let them ha ng there 
for several da ys. And each day the pe ople who would go out to work had to ma rch around. 
 

Q: Pass by them. 

 

A: Ye s, to watch. These guys would stand w
ith whips and if your face was down they would 
smack you s o you would look up and watch the hangings, kids, everyone. When we got to the 

ghetto my mother still continued digg
ing ditches but my sister ma naged–. 
 

Q: That was the work that sh
e was doing outside the ghetto? 
 

A: Ye s, supposedly building roads. All she wa
s doing was digging ditches, covering one ditch and 
then digging another ditch and covering the 
second ditch. That™s  all they would do. 
 
Q: They were keeping them busy, basically. 
 

A: Yeah.  But my sister ma naged to get into 
an old warehouse. These 
were mostly young wome n 
who were knitting and crocheting clothing articles 
for the soldiers on the front. That was a very 
good job because it was indoors so 
that was good.  But I reme mber one day she was not feeling 

well.  She couldn™t go to work so it was decided that
 I would take her place.  So I took her card. 
 

Q: How old we re you at this time? 

 

A: About eleven.  But people didn™t care as long as
 I had the papers. All the Jewish people knew 
but nobody would say anything.  So I 
went there and they showed me  whe r e her seat wa s, the 
bench and I don™t even reme mber what she was kn
itting.  It wasn™t  croc
heting, it was knitting, a 
scarf or a sweater.  No, it couldn™t have been a sweater because I wouldn™t  know how to do that 

but a scarf I did know and that was it.And I st
arted knitting and all of
 a sudden I felt some one 
was looking at me , watching me  and there was th
is mean looking German going around and just 
looking. And he stood behind me  for  a while and 
observed me  and apparently I wasn™t  doing it 
fast enough or whatever and he 
got very angry with me .  He started screaming dunner vetter and 
started cursing. And I didn™t answer.  I kept do
ing what I was doing.  Finally I didn™t please him 
obviously.  He grabbed the needles 
out of my hand and stuck one of
 them in my finger and this 
is what it is now.  I passed out and that was 
my experience taking my sister ™s pl ace.  In the 
beginning of the ghetto there was like a little hosp
ital. And there was stil
l one doctor left. And 
I reme mber his name , Dr. Grossfeld.  He tried to 
do his best to help people but that again didn™t 

last long.  Pretty soon there was no more hos
pital, there were no 
more supplies and he 

disappeared. That™s  another thing that was happening in the ghetto.  Every now and then at no 
specific time for no reason obviously a van would 
come  or a big truck and they would grab 
people just–. 
 

Q: Justindi scrimi nately. 

 

A: Indiscrimi nately, babies, little kids, old people,
 anybody. They would just grab them, put them 
in the truck. And you never heard from them agai
n.  Dr, Grossfeld disappeared in one of those 
actions where they would come  and just grab 
people indiscrimi nately. That™s  why there was 
also such a demoralizing feeling.  One never knew,
 I never knew if I would see my mother and 
my sister again because these actions could occur 
during work or after work or before work or 

anytime. And that uncertainty too wa s very, very difficult. 
 

Q: If you weren™t going out and trying to get food or some thing how did you spend your days in 
the ghetto while they were at work? 
 

A: Just sitting or walking with my friends and ta
lking about food. That was all we talked about.  
At that point some body a s ked me , we ll didn™t you ta
lk about your Dad.  He was taken. We ll, 
my mother was really in retrospect when I think of it a phenome nal person.  She never let us 

give up hope.  She would always talk about 
plans -- how we would celebrate when Da ddy came 
home.  I didn™t  think it was that 
unusual but she turned 
gray overnight when they took my father 
away.  Overnight.  She woke up -- she was comple
tely gray.  I guess she knew deep in her soul 
that my father never would come  back. Ye t sh
e wouldn™t let us give up 
hope.  It was a very 
difficult time.  But again when I look at it fr
om today™s perspective it wasn™t  so bad for me  
because I still had my mother and my sister. At  that point  their love  and our caring for each 

other compensated for all the physical atrocities, 
and they were atrocities. We  were cold; we 
were hungry; we were not well; we were uncerta
in of out tomorrow. It was almost as if you 
lived in suspension from day to day. And that™s
 the way we coped. It was really terrible when 
you think of comi ng from a fairly advanced civilized
 life to living in one room with three other 
fa milies, sharing the whole house, that was a big 
-- I think a three stor y house, we share one 
bathroom and one kitchen for the entire house. 
 

Q: Do you remember how ma ny peopl e were in the house? 

 

A: I would say at least a hundred. 

 

Q: And you had one bathroom and one kitchen? 

 

A: Ye s.  But anyway life went on. Wi nter came  and that was very difficult. There was no heat; 
there was no warm water. There was as a matter 
of fact very little water, even cold wa ter.  
People started dying, people disappeared in the acti
ons and in early spring
 we got a new decree. 
 

Q: This would be in 1942? 

 

A: Ye s, early spring of ™42. We  were ordered 
to move again.  Grab what you can whatever you 
have and me et in the central place. That wa
s not the ma rketplace but
 in the ghetto. What 
happened was that they decide
d our numbers had dwindled a
nd they didn™t  need such a 
spacious place as we had there and they moved us  
to a smaller ghetto and that was really one of 

the shabbiest parts of town.  
Nobody lived there for years.  
However there was one redeeming 

feature in that new ghetto.  It 
was again surrounded by high fence 
and barbed wire and all these 
goodies.  But one side of the ghetto was right ne
xt to the river and our assigned place to live 
was in the little shack right
 on the river and that was not fenced 
in.  It was really even worse and 
smaller than the place we lived before but it
 was on the river and it 
was important to us. 
 
Q: Why was that important? 

 

A: Because it was open and it wasn™t  guarded.  My 
mother was rather happy with that. When we 
moved we were again with different people and ag
ain there wa sn™t  enough room to sleep us all 
on the floor so we had to build like bunks so ther
e were three in a row stacked up. And then life 
went on again the way it was before except that there was much more chaos and people became 

more panicky and even though we had no outside knowledge of what was going on, no radio, 

no newspaper, no ma il, we were completely cut off from the  world, the people who were going 

out to work would gather some  infor mation, ru
mors from the  outside.  Some how rumors begin 
to float in the ghetto that they were going to 
kill us all soon. There we
re also visible signs.  
There were more Ukrainian militia in the ghetto and there were more Germans within the 

ghetto, too. They would just ma rch around with 
their high boots, all dressed up and spit when 

they™d see you and ma ke  you walk on the road not on the sidewalk. And then my mot her 

apparently, I don™t know if she started earlier, but 
that™s when she shared it with my sister and 
me , that she started looking for some  places wher
e we could hi de.  For a long time she said she 
couldn™t find, ma ke any connection on the outside. 
 Finally one day in the spring she came back 
and she was very excited. And she said sh
e found two places.  She couldn™t find one hiding 
place for three but she found two.  One farmer wa
s willing to take two people, obviously for 
money and another one was willing to take one.
 And there was her Solomon™s decision -- who 
will go where. Well my mother decided since my 
sister  was four years older than I she could 
manage by herself and my mother and I would go 
to the second place. The farmer who agreed 
to hide my mother and me  was known to us.  He
 was on the other side of the river and before 
the war my mother would get, ma ny times she 
would get dairy products, milk and cheese and 
butter from t his farmer ™s place and it sounded very
 logical to me .  How she did connect with 
them I don™t know but she did.  She was not happy 
but she was satisfied that she was able to 
accomplish that. And we just waited for the time 
that she would say when we should do it. And 
that time came in earlyAugust. 
 

Q: Of1942?  

 

A: Ye s.  One day in the morning or the night before
 my sister packed  her 
little bundle.  My mother 
helped her.  In the morning we said our 
goodbyes and we were ma king plans how we™ll me et 
after this horrible time was over.  I never saw my 
sister.  She went to work in the morning and 
that was the last time I saw her. 
 

Q: Wa s the plan for her to go from wor k? 

 

A: From work to the hidi ng place, yes. 

 

Q: Do you know where her hiding place was 
supposed to be where she was going to? 
 

A: I know it was right on the outside of our town 
and then the farmer was supposed to come  and 
pick her up fr om work.  It was not in Skbelk
a which was the pl ace my mot her and I were going 
to hide. 

 
Q: Now Skbelka is a different town from–. 

 

A: Skbelka is a little vi llage. 

 

Q: Across the river from your town? 

 

A: Across the river from my town, yeah.  She left. 
There were several days my mother didn™t  hear 
anything.  She was satisfied that everything went
 well. Then she said the time she™ll let me 
know when it™s time for us to go.  Meanwhile there was a lot of commoti on in the ghetto, ma ny 

more Germa ns. They were comi ng and going and it was evident that something was going on.  

So about a week, I don™t know exactly, but about a 
week after my sister left she came home  one 
day from work and we ate our meager supper and 
she told me  to put on two of everything that I 
had the best which wasn™t  that much left.  I 
reme mber I had some  high top shoes that you don™t 
wear in the summertime but she said put them on. 
 She packed a little bundle of stuff for herself 
and a bundle for me .  She kept re
peating giving me  directions of
 how to get to the farmer ™s 
place on the other si de of the river. 
 

Q: We re you going to go together or separately? 

 

A: Together. At  night when it got dark. You see 
there were no guards or anything so that was very 
good.  Otherwise we couldn™t have gotten out of th
e ghetto.  So when it got real dark she took 
my hand.We  just walked out. We  didn™t say an
ything to the other peop
le.  But everybody had 
different plans. Whoever was left was goi
ng their own way and everybody was confused.  
There was not a good relationship.  It seemed that nobody knew what to do and everybody 

wanted to survive. They tried to hang on to life 
whatever it cost. And so we left and we walked 
into the underbrush, th
e bulrushes and all. 
 

Q: Now did you have to climb out of 
your window or some thing like that? 
 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: You just walked right out and right to the river. 

 

A: Wa lked right out. That little shack was right 
on the river. I guess the Germans felt very secure.  
Where would we go?   Into the river?  And so we
 started walking towards 
the river and all of a 
sudden shots rang out.  It was so still.  It was 
very, very quiet and so we couldn™t move. The 
shots were sporadic but it lasted almo st all ni
ght. And so we were stuck.  By morning ma ny 
other people had the same  idea as we did. 
 

Q: To get down to the river. 

 

A: That™s  right, so every–. 

 

Q: You were still in the underbrush at this time? 

 

A: We  were in the river but it was it was shallow.
 We  were covered.  It was thick underbrush, these 
bulrushes I guess and all sorts of
 things where you could hide. 
 But by morning a lot of other 
people kept going into the river 
and by that time machine guns 
were going full blast all the 

time. There were these screams and shouts by the Ukrainian militiamen and this is something I 
can™t  get rid of that sound and of that phrase 
and they kept screami
ng; village ???? Meaning 
crawl out Jew, I can see you.  Most of the people cam
e out. We  didn™t. We  stayed there. That 
lasted a whole day and by night when night fe
ll the machine guns were going full blast. We  
couldn™t move. And so we stayed there.  I reme
mber my mother gave me
 that soggy bread that 
she packed and it tasted awful and she ma de me  eat 
it.  She sa id I needed the strength. We  spent 
another night in the water and the next morni
ng there was fire and there were screams and I 
heard babies crying and I guess the time  they we
re liquidating the ghetto. I can™t  say the water 
turned red but it should have because the mach
ine guns were going again 
full blast all the time 
and we stayed in that river.  I kept dozing off 
and I know we stayed in th
e river for a number of 
days but I don™t know exactly how ma ny days. 
 But one mo ment I opened my eyes and my 
mother was gone and I really became panic stricken and I tried to rationa
lize that I probably fell 
asleep and she had to make her way to the fa
rmer ™s  place and I would have to find my way 
there by myself to join her. And then all 
of a sudden everything got quiet. There was no 

move me nt, nothing. And I stayed until da rk and then I ma de my way across the river and I 

walked.  I reme mber walking, walking for so l
ong until I came to the farmer ™s place, to the 
barn.  I™m sure I must have been a sight, di
rty and wet and the dogs started barking and the 
far mer came  out.  It was just beginning to -- dayl
ight wasn™t  -- I mean it was dawn and he came 
out in his coveralls and I asked hi
m if my mother was there,  He 
said no.  I said well I™ll wait 
until she come s.  He said what do you mean you™
ll wait, you will not wa it here.  I sa id you did 
agree to keep us here for a time, I didn™t  know 
for how long.  He said well, I changed my mi nd.  
It™s too dangerous.  I said well, just  let me st
ay until my mother comes.  He said you can stay 
the day, I™ll give you some thing to eat and at 
night when it gets dark you better leave or I™ll 
report you to the authorities. And I was just be
wildered at that point
 but it was very ironic 
because I noticed he  wore my father ™s gold pocket watch with the coveralls 
 
Q: That™s what your mother probably paid him–. 
 

A: I™m sure that was part of it, I™m sure.  But hi
s wife gave me  some  soup and some  food. I wasn™t  
even hungry at that point. I stayed in the barn un
til it got dark and they gave me  some  bread and 
an apple.  I reme mber and they told me  to l
eave. And I was so I gue
ss bewildered and really 
panic stricken.  I didn™t think straight and I wa
lked on the ma in street of that village. Anybody 
could have seen me  or caught me  but I was lucky.
  God was with me  I guess if there is a God.  
And I walked all the way on the ma in street  of 
that village until I came to an open fi eld where 
we lived.  It™s agrarian, it™s the br eadba sket actu
ally of Ukraine so there were these lush wheat 
fields and I spent the next two days
 in a field just sitting there lik
e in a stupor.  By that time  the 
bread was gone and the apple was gone and I ju
st didn™t know what to do and my mi nd refused 
to give up.  I felt, I don™t know how to say it, bu
t I felt as if I had let 
my mother down, that I 
dozed off if she had to leave me  and now he™s  
looking for someplace for me  because he refused 
to give us protection.And so I decided then that 
my only way to live or to survive is to find my 
mother and I felt that I have to go and look for he
r.  Our area has ma ny forests so I decided then 
and there -- it was still early fall -- that I have to
 go fr om forest to forest  until I fi nd her. And 
that™s where my odyssey really starts. I started 
going from fore st to forest and I walked and 
walked and the illusion when you look at some
thing -- I mean my geography wasn™t  any good 

but I soon learned south and north and east and we st
. You look at a forest and it seems  it™s so 
close and you walk and you walk and it™s not there. 
 I walked all night and 
I tried to rest in the 
daytime.  But meanwhile I needed to eat, too.  So
 I would try to go to little villages in the 
outskirts and grab some thing from a  garden or so
mething and that™s the way I survived the fi rst 
months. The first months were also -- several 
things happened that were
 horribl e. In the very 

beginning I would come  across st ragglers like myse
lf from different ghettos because apparently 
Hitler liqui dated all the ghettos in our area abou
t the same time.  I would fi nd other people in 
the forests who were in similar situations. They
 were looking for their loved ones, they were 
looking for friends or whatever. And so I trie
d to get information about my fa mily.  Nobody 
knew anything and I didn™t  know anything about th
eirs.  One time we we re on the edge of a 
forest and there were se ve n of us from differ
ent places. There was a mother and a baby and two 
boys and two wome n. Anyway there were six ot
her people and we were sitting and trying to 
get information from one another. And all of
 a sudden a bunch of kids from the neighboring 
village spotted us and they st
arted yelling at us. ﬁJews, Jews.ﬂThere was remuneration for 
reporting a Jew, however small it was. And they 
ran back to the village and we realized that 

soon some body™s going to come  after us.We  were 
sitting on the edge of a forest. This was -- 
there are different kinds of forest -- this one ha
d very little underbrus
h. There was no place to 
hide except climbing up a tree which wasn™t  th
e smartest thing to do.  But there were huge 

haystacks in the field so we ran to hide in
 the haystacks and some
how for an unexplainable 

reason we all ended up in the same  haystack, all seven of us.  I don™t know what the haystack 

looked like on the outside but I™m sure it wasn™t
 very difficult for them to realize where we 

were.  Pretty soon we heard voices of the villagers and the kids and they came  back, they came 

there with pitchforks. They just ma de a game  of
 it and they kept pushing 
the pitchforks into the 
haystacks. That went on for hours it seems lik
e.  It was in the afte
rnoon, late afternoon.And 
pretty soon it was quiet and I h
eard a lot of commotion around me . 
And when it got real quiet I 
waited, I think it was the mi ddle of
 the night when I crawled out. 
 

Q: Were there people still in there with you? 

 

A: No. 

 
Q: You were alone at that point? 
 

A: I don™t know.  It was quiet; it was completely qu
iet and I crawled out an
d there were six bodies 
lined up, their clothes gone, their shoe s gone, mu
tilated; coul dn™t  recognize them except the 
baby because  of the size.  Baby was on the ches
t of the mother and I was the only one who 
survived that ma ssacre.  I don™t know why or 
how.  I don™t know, maybe I was in the mi ddle, I 
don™t know. And I stayed there for a while.  I didn™t
 even cover them with leaves or anything.  I 
just walked away. There were ma ny incident s like  
these. And this went on for three years. The 
winters were very difficult because it was not on
ly hunger and thirst, it was cold. And the snow, 
footprints would show in the snow.  Dogs would 
give you away if you go close to a village or to 

a barn.  I tried, in the winter I 
tried to go from barn to barn a
nd to keep warm or I would crawl 
in, they have these, they were not haystacks bu
t where they kept, where the peasants keep the 
potatoes.  It™s  like–. 
 

Q: Potatocellars. 

 

A: Some thing like that.  
It was just awful.  It was not only 
the hunger and the cold.  It was being 
alone and someti mes not heari
ng a huma n voice for weeks at a time.  It got so ma ny times 
where I just  didn™t even care but I 
kept getting my strength from 
the fact that I had to find my 
mother.  I never found her. And th
en apparently I got very sick a
nd I was like in a little grave 
covered with leaves in the forest and the Russi
an soldiers found me  th
ere.  I don™t know how 
long I was there and they took me  to some  hospita
ls and they nursed me  back to health.  My 
quest, my search for my mother continued and wh
en the war was over I went back to my home 

town.  I found that there was one other person who survived.  She was an older woma n. As a 
matter of fact she is here inAmerica. She lives 
in Duluth, Minnesota. An
d other than that there 
were no other survivors.  I mean there were pe
ople who ma de their way illegally during the war 
but the survivors from the ghetto were just myse
lf and this other woma n. And when I got back 
to my home t own I didn™t learn much except 
that some body denounced my  sister and they 
tortur ed her and they humiliated her. They para
ded her on the main street in the nude and then 

they murdered her. And that must have happene
d very shortly after she 
left.  I never found out 
what happened to my mo ther and I don™t know fo
r sure what happened to my father. You know 
the horrible feeling -- there is 
nothing tangible for me  to mourn. When some one dies you have 
a cemetery, you can go and put some  flowers and say a prayer.   I have nothing. And to this day 

it seems, I know it™s ridiculous but when I walk 
and when I see some one -- my father was about 
6™4ﬂ and my  mother was almost 6 foot tall --and 
when I see some one of the build and height,   
people remi nd me  of my  parents.  I have to run 
in front of them ad look back to see it™s  not 
them.   And then I made my way.  I kept 
still looking for my mother and everybody said all 
survivors or people who survived ar e going to Germany.  So illegally fr om what became the 

Soviet Union again I went through Br atislava and 
Vi enna to Germany. That™s the way all the 
survivors went.When we came to Germany there were
 lots of people, all sorts of people there.  
The ironic thing was that these people were su
rvivors like my self, the remnants. And there 
were people who were running from t he consequen
ces of their collaborating with the Ge rmans 
and so we all ended up in the same  DP camps a nd th
at was very, very difficult.  But finally they 
did separate us.And then even though we, as a su
rvivor and as an orphan 
at that point, I still 
had to wait three years. 
 

Q: You were about sixteen, seve
nteen years old at this time? 

 

A: About fifteen, yeah and I sti
ll had to wait three years to be 
able to go to the United St ates. 
 

Q: So you lived in one of th
ese camps for three years? 
 

A: I lived in different camps, yeah. And the la
st camp I lived is in Benzheim which is near 
St uutgart near Darmstadt and I ma naged to go to
 the University of Heidelberg.  How they 
accepted me  is beyond me  because I didn™t ha ve any for mal education. 
 

Q: Past when the war started, yeah. 

 

A: Yeah, but I took some  tests and I think they felt 
sorry for me  so they admitted me . And I went 
there for two reasons: one, I wanted to get so
me  education and number two, I thought I could 
get a student™s visa to get toAmerica. We ll, th
e visa that I did get, the permanent visa came  
earlier.  But it was three years that I had to wait. 
 

Q: So you came to the United St ates in ™48? 

 

A: 1948,yeah. 

 

Q: Did you have relatives?  You 
did, that™s  right, your aunts? 
 

A: Ye s, yes. There was one aunt, the one in Colum
bus, Ohio and my father ™s  sister.  She™s the only 
one who™s still alive now. And she took me  in.  I came in like on June 25
th
 and I think June 26
th
 
she sent me  to Central High.  I didn™t speak a wo
rd of English and I hated the world and I hated 

myself but it was the best thing they did, tried 
to give me  some educat
ion. And then I met my 
husband.  He was called back into the serv
ice and guess where his first assignment is? 
 
Q: Germany.  

 

A: That™s right, you™re right. And I refused to 
go until I became a citizen, anAmerican citizen.  
And then I went back and it was difficult. That
™s my life in a nutshell.  For ma ny ye ars I didn™t 
speak out.  I told my husband, I told my son but 
my fa mily, the few who were still alive didn™t 
want to hear about it. And it was difficult for me
 to talk about it so I 
didn™t .  But then in 1983 
there was a gathering here inWa shington and I we
nt to that gathering and something in me, I 
just sort of awoke and I said I™m 
ready; I have to tell my story.  
I have a ma ndate.  I felt as if I 
have a mandate to speak for all these and I 
call them martyrs not vi
ctims who never had a 
chance. And I™m their spokesperson.  I have to 
speak out and tell the story because I don™t want 
the world to forget.And yet I some time s, I have
n™t done it in recent mont hs, but I was speaking 
at the Capital Children™s Museum about a year a
go and there was a class 
of -- I think -- fourth 
graders which is quite young and you speak in not ve
ry severe terms to children that age.  But 
they came with several chaperones and one of 
the fathers who was a chaperone came over to 
me  a fter my presentation and he says Mrs. Skif
f–.I says Schiff -- yes, Mrs. Schiff come on, 
admit, it™s all a figment of your imagi nation.  So 
that™s where we are today.And I feel, I me an 
that I do have a mi ssion and I try.  It™s not gettin
g any easier for me  but I feel that I do have to 
do it.  I have to tell people what happened and 
ma ybe we™ll learn something from our past.  But 
apparently we haven™t learned very much.  Look 
what™s  going on in Bosnia.  Look what™s  going 
on in Soma lia, Sudan, the Soviet Union.  People 
are hungry for power and there™s so much hate 
in this world.  I don™t know how we can get rid of
 it -- intolerance, hate, I don™t know.  So this is 
my dilemma , what I have to live with.  Do you have any questions? 
 
Q: No, I think I™m done. Thank you. 
 

A: You™rewelcome.Thankyou. 

 

(The tape then resume d) 

 

Q: Yourfatherwas–.? 

 

A: One of six and he had five sisters w
ho ended up emigrating to the United St ates. 
 

Q: All of them emigrating? 

 

A: Yes.  I™m not sure if they married 
here or they ma rried in the old country. 

 

Q: Andmoved? 

 

A: Yes.  I think they all came either with getting 
ready to ma rry or already ma rried.  He also had a 
mother.  My grandmother on my father ™s side di
ed in 1942 I™m told litera
lly of a broken heart 
because her baby boy never ma de it out of Poland.  
I know that my father had several doctorates 
from Switzerland, from the Sorbonne and I™m not 
sure about Heidelberg but I mean I know he 
had several advanced degrees from different 
places. What was puzzling to me  then I 
understand now. None of them were from Poland. 
 In Poland apparently there was a quota and 
he had to go elsewhere to get his education.  
My mother I know was 
a teacher but she never 

actively taught. 
 
Q: She was trained as a teacher? 

 

A: Ye s but I don™t reme mbe r  her being a full-ti
me  teacher.  She was always involved in ot her 
things. 
 

Q: Do you remember how old they were in 1939 or so? 

 

A: My father would have been in his late thir
ties and my mother would 
have been in her mi d-
thirties.  I™m not sure. 
 

Q: The reason I ask is because one 
of the few parts of key informa tion that we do need for the ID is 
a picture and the date of birth. 
 

A: I™ll have that and I don™t know it. 

 

Q: We  can approxima te. We  can say circa a certain time . 

 

A: I see, yeah but they were youthful.  My mo
ther came from a village.  She was not from 
Horochow. The name  of the village was Luczyce. 
 

Q: Luczyce and that™s in Poland? 

 

A: Ye s.  It wasn™t  very far fr om Horochow appa
rently. And my grandparents on my mother ™s side 
had a huge farm and we used to go there some time s in the summer, I reme mber that. 
 

Q: Did she have brothers and sisters? 

 

A: Yes, my mot her had twobrot
hers and one sister.  I also re
member my great-grandmother on my 
mother ™s side.  Miriam was her name, Grandma Mi
riam.  She was 113 years old when she died.  
And I said she had long blond hair.  I™m sure it 
was long gray hair, but 
she still had her own 
hair, I reme mber that. 
 

Q: Do you remember where your father was born or where his family was fr om? 

 

A: I don™t know.  I think they were from that pl ace, fr om Horochow, yeah. 

 

Q: But they were definitely from Poland? 

 

A: Ye s, definitely Poland, yeah. And his father w
hom I never met, I never met my father ™s parents, 
but his father apparently died early when my 
father was young and he was a Hebrew teacher to 
the Jewish kids in Horochow. You want to he
ar some thing funny?  When I came  back in 1988 
my husband and I talked what would I find and he 
tried to warn me  not to be disappointed and 
what have you. And then it was sort of like an 
afterthought he said well whatever they did to 
the town, the ghettos were erasedapparently I don™t know I haven™t 
seen it now, but he said at 
least the river, you™ll show me  the river which 
was so important in your life.  Guess what?   
They diverted the river. When I asked I said 
I want to show my husband the river they said no 
more river, no more river. The river ™s name  
was Bezimyenna  and Bezimy enna in Polish me ans 

no name . And I mean no name  and they did away with it. 
 
Q: No place either. 

 

A: No place, that™s right, yeah. And another thing 
wa s when I told the st ory of the haystacks to my 
son and husband they didn™t say anything. Then when we drove to my hometown fr om Lvov 

all of a sudden my son gets so excited.  He says, 
oh look what is that?   I sa
id it™s  a haystack.  He 
said that™s a haystack it looks like a house. Th
ey never had the heart to ask me  because here 
haystacks are pretty small and there they do di
ffe r ent kinds but these haystacks were so huge 
they were almost like a barn, so big.  He sa
ys now I understand.  I never had the heart to ask 
you how could seven people hide in a 
haystack. That™s  about it.
