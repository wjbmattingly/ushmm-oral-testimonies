Israel Ipson 
December 3, 1995 
 
A:Okay.  My name  is Israel Ipson.  I've b
een born in Lithuanian in 1911, March 15th, 1911.  
And my father was a worker, worked in 
the brewery.  The brewery was in Slobodka.  
Why is it the brewery wa s in a place in 
Slobodka?   You know, the Lithuanians didn't 
want to have the industry, what comi ng up, to 
the Lithuanians, that they should have it.  
The Jews were not allowed to go to work 
in Kovno, which Kovno was the capital city of 
Lithuania, so we had to go to work in
 Slobodka.  Slobodka was a suburb.  In Slobodka 
lives around 10,000 Jews.  Mostly the poor.  They
 didn't have nothing to eat, and it was a 
pity.  For where I come from a very, very 
poor family.  My grandfather worked in the 
brewery with Golswolf Ingleman (ph).  My 
father worked in the brewery.  My uncle -- 
almost everybody in the poor Jews in Lithuani
an worked for the brewery.  Why?   The 
owner from the brewery was th
e Wol fs, Wolf brothers.  There were six brothers.  The 
fa mily were the Wolfs, a nd they were a very
 philanthropic family.  And t hey support the 
Jews.  How?  They build the brewery, and 
everybody almost work for the brewery.  They 
also invent a time -- used to be a time  where fu
ll of snowing.  In Lithua
nian is a lot of full 
of snow, and they used to be covered up 
and drowned in snow.  Wa s sending in with 
horses for the brewery to get the people, bri
ng them back to the place of work.  That's 
how heavy the snow it was.  And my father
 was liked by the brewme ister (ph).  The 
brewme ister was a German from Bavaria, and 
he was his helper.  A
nything -- the war got 
to be -- now my father used to do in the 
brewery, the brewmeister 
done only sit and got 
the taste of the beer, the color.
  I remember father used to 
-- I used to bring my father 
lunch every day.  My mo ther used to send me
 potato sweet herring. It would want that 
my father should be thirsty, be able to drink 
the beer and save the tune for the beer, they 
call it.  And the pilsne
r and all the name s, they funny.  
And it's the way the poor Jews in 
Slobodka, they ma ke their living.  Later onwhen Lithuania become  an independent

nation run by a school teacher, or
 the name  Smetona, he gave the Jews more right.  What 
he done, he brought the Jews away from the brewery. 
 The brewery was filled with          , 
but it opened up more industries to the Lit
huanians to ma ke him happy.  Smetona was a 
smart -- very -- was such a nice man.  Tried to 
he lp also the Jews to part icipate in the 
industry.  It shouldn't be any fi ghts between the Jews and the L
ithuanians, try to avoid it.  
But still after, there's still was plenty bad 
feeling between one and the other.  And what 
has happened, the biggest problem I think what 
it was, the Lithuanians start taking out -- 
the German took the Lithuanian out and send 
them to camps to work.  They also, the 
Russians, the communists, was being picked, 
like  the school teachers, ma nufacturers, the 
richer eleme nt of people, they 
used to be sent to Siberia,
 blaming them for the things 
which not happened.  But also the Jews didn'
t knew nothing about it, but they should be 
saying that the Jews kill their own, that take 
no other Lithuanians to Siberia.  Siberia was 
a -- the camp, a labor camp.  It is a very, ver
y, very mi serable place to be.  But mostly 90 
percent from the people who be sent to Sibe
ria been dead because they didn't seem t o 
come back alive.  
Question:  What era are you 
talking about right now?   
 
A:Siberia.  

 

Q: When you're talking about the Germans and 
the communists, what year are you talking?   
 

A:Oh, it was in 1941.  

 

Q:You're talking later?   

 

A:Right.

Q:Okay.  Let's go back a little.  And I want to as
k you a little bit more about your family life as a 
boy, your religious background.  
 
A:Oh, I see.  

 

Q:Just the lifestyle in Slobodka.   

 

A:Right.  Well, I was also came in time when we 
didn't have any telephones; we didn't  have any 
lights.  I used to go in school            
they call it.  What was the -- ever was the old person, 
knowledgeable, been pitching for pay to the boys 
to go to hayda (ph), we used to call it.  
And at the hayda we used to come  in a
nd stay there until, in wi ntertime, 7:00, 8:00 
o'clock at night until it get 
dark and bring them home.  A
nd that was our education to 
people.  Like my wife was just saying, sh
e speaks good Jewish, the Jewish language.  The 
Jewish language was a language from childhood you got it up.  And I had two rabbis, 

because one rabbi was the Hebrew language, another was Jewi sh.  And then we had in 

Slobodka a rabbinical semi nary.  The biggest ra
bbinical semi nary in the world, because 
in that time, in 1914, -17, the only thing they 
knew is to learn the bible.  The people wa s 
poor.  There was nothing to eat.  They were 
sitting there all day l
ong in the seera (ph), 
they call it, it is a rabbinical semi nary.  
And people from all over the world would be 
sending their youth to that semi
nary in Slobodka.  It was not
 only later on
 -- the later 
years grew up, it was            with th
eir also young kids been going there to teach to 
become  a rabbi.  But it is really -- the big leav
ing to be a rabbi at that time, they couldn't 
do nothing.  They couldn't  ma ke it.  But th
ey been supported by the American people, 
even in World`Wa r`I.  They already been se
nding help to the Jews in Slobodka.  The 
chief rabbis used to come  in here and in 
speeches speaking through the American Jew to 
help the Jews in Slobodka, because all it be 
these weddings used to come  between rabbis 
and -- and then the rabbi had a daughter who ha
d got to get married, used to take along 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
4 
 
with him the comment of a trip to America a
nd find -- go to the seer
a to pick a boka (ph), 
to pick a learning young ma n that they s
hould get ma rried and been supported by the 
Jews in America.  It was a tradition to 
help the orthodox.  And it 
is still right now in 
Slobodka.  The seera is in existence now in
 Israel.  They know more in Slobodka, but 
after the war they move the chief rabbi, moved him to Israel.  
 
Q:So your boyhood was very involved w
ith religious learning and --  

 

A:Right.  And then I was -- after the learning, the 
religious learning, I went
 in high`school.  It 
became the Jews decided to open up a hipper (ph)  high`sc hool.  And it became the 

Germans in 1917 they had a lot of educated peop
le in the army and they decided to stay 
in Lithuanian to teach us, and then we ha
d enough people to get a 
private school going.  
And it was like one famous teacher, Karlbah (p
h) , and he -- in his name  was created a 
high`school, and it called Karlbah           
.  And then we had also in the Russian language 
a high`school.  And we had in Lithuanian we
 had three high`schools.  And then we had 
the orthodox school was in Kovno.  And ev
erybody been happy until Hitler come  to 
being.  
 

Q:Okay.  What -- tell me a little
 bit about your family.  Did you 
have brothers and sisters?  
 

A:I have -- I had two sisters -- didn't have any 
brothers -- and they perished in the Holocaust.  
And one was ma rried, and the other one was st
ill a girl.  She was ma rried, but she was a 
fa mous -- how you call it?   Painting.  She was 
a oil painting.  She had a name .  They as k 
her to come  to Paris, and she was staying 
for three months in Paris and learning the 
painting guys.  She come  back with the fa
mous paint pieces and all that stuff.  
 

Q:Do you have me mori es of your family life together?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
5 
 
 
A:Oh, I have, yeah.  

 

Q:Nice fami ly life?   

 

A:Very nice.  We ll, we been all 
together until I ma rried.  I was st
aying home with my parents.  
And my father, he was a orthodox Jew, and ever
ything -- we used to come  to holidays.  
We took it together, like the Passover holidays, the high holidays, and we been me et 

together.  Everybody would come .  And the 
woma n -- it was orthodox fashion, the prayer 
separate.  They have a separation between
 me n a nd woma n.  But that reminds me  
different mo me nts that they -- I don't know 
what you call it.  A helper who helps the 
synagogue.  Summis (ph), is that
 how you call it?   Hell.  I'll ha
ve to skip it.  I don't know 
how to say in English.  They call them a speci
al -- used to go out on every Friday night 
and say, "Jews, you got to close the stores.  There's 
all this            comi ng around.  Don't 
do any business anymore."  So some one got to 
stop them, and they used to stop it.  But 

everythi ng was fine until 2042 when the war starte
d with Hitler and St alin and Churchill.  
I used to like to listen to the shortwave ra
dio.  And the Jews which was locked up in the 
ghetto, we used to come  to my place where I lived to hear what's going on in the fronts.  

Well, how is Hitler doing?  Well, Hitler is 
winning the war or losing the war?   And we 
was very interested in this.  They come fr
om my working place, which was the airport, 
and talking till the group, which used to come to listen to me, what's happened on the 

front, how Hitler is doing.  And they used to 
come  up.  To e xplain the truth, I was already 
scared.  They could lock me  up and find out a
bout it, because if you were a Kraut.  And I 
be begging them they shouldn't come no more, 
because -- and I -- they didn't have a place 
nowhere to go, and they still --
 I said, "Tell them it's very important."  And they were 
very interested, like they
 would be generals, they used to 
tell me.  One would sit here this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357

way and one would sit that way, and they kne
w what they were talking about and they 
been leading the war.  
 
Q:Okay.  Let's -- I don't want to get quite there 
yet.  I still want a fe
w more questionsabout 
before the wa r began; okay?   
 

A:Uh-huh.  

 

Q:Now, wer e  you -- were there all kinds of sort 
of -- I'm still trying to learn more about the life 
in Slobodka.  You got married at what time ?   
 

A:I got married in 1931.  

 

Q:And what -- I'm trying to get a sense about th
e sort of political atmosphere, the cultural 
atmosphere.  Did you have contact with 
Lithuanian people?   All of that.   
 

A:Let's see.  Well, I went -- in Lithuanian after 
I finished high`school, I went to college, and in 
college I took up law.  And I was -- liked to 
stay with law.  And 
I was doing all right.  I 
have a nice trade, because the law -- Lithua
nians who have been a
ll together in groups 
mostly going out together and discussing toge
ther, going to the -- every evening we used 
to come  to one or to the other          
 .  And until Celingus (ph) was the ringstat (ph) or  
justice that come out with the decree that 
not one Jew cannot practice law until -- not no 

Jew.  I'm sor r y.  He didn't me ntion Jew.  
He said not one young ma n who graduated from 
college in Lithuania cannot practice law before 
he got to go in court who working for five 
years.  After the five years working in the 
court, he can practice law.  I didn't have no 
choice, but I still did not have 
any choice.  I couldn't get in to
 work in the court, because 
they answer -- when I used to
 send application to 
the courts and ask them for a job in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
7 
 
court, to open it up that I should be able to be
come  a lawyer, the answer used to be all the 
time, "Sorry.  We don't  have any vacancies. 
 We  cannot help you."  And I couldn't get in 
in law.  
 

Q: What year was this?  

 

A:It was in 1932.  And then one day 
it was -- it was a lucky mo me nt with the courts.  I had to get 
a job already.  Jay was born and I got ma rrie
d, I had to ma ke a living.  My father was 
poor.  And I took a job as accountant and worked in a big concern (ph) .  And I worked 

there, and one of my buddies, my friends from
 c ollege, he recognized me  that I came  to 
the governme nt bank to pay a bill, I don't re
me mber, for the company  I work through, 
because the company as ked me to make a 
deposit and I'm paying.  That he  was a 
Lithuanian.  He worked with chief of police.  Bu
t he also went to the college.  He come to 
me  and say, "Ipson, look.  I got some thing."
  My name  was Ipson. Iposon (ph) in 
Lithuanian.  "I got some thing -- good news 
for you.  Don't tell nobody, but I can give you 
a tip now."  Lithuanian didn't have any mechan
ical business, like cars, trucks, machinery.  

It was a poor farm country, like 87 percent of
 the Lithuanians was far mer.  Then they 
didn't have nothing.  And now already the count
ries like -- like now the Balkans, already 
they are Czechoslovaki a started in their time,
 Bulgaria.  Here no one with fighting with 
all that st uff.  And Hitler's told this Czechos
lovaki an, told the League of Nations -- was in 

at that time .  Like the Unite
d Nations, it was the League of Nations.  He told the League 
of Nations that he wanted Czechoslovakia, sa
id that Czechoslovakia was his.  And that 
start already in that time beginning all the fights.
  But -- and I worked at the factory -- at 
the company as accountant.  And another one came
 to me , al so.  He say that's what me a 

good job to be is the distributor
 of Belgian-ma de motorcycles.  That was the F.N.  F.N. 
stand for           .  And I got the job for 
-- I like the motorcycles.  I went to work for the 
motorcycles, and that was lucky.  I started 
ma king money.  But it didn't last long.  I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357

started and the war started and 
Stalin got in.  They divided 
Europe in two halves: half 
Hitler and half Stalin.  And they divided that between themselves, and we didn't have 
nothing but what we had in the bank.  We  lo
st everything.  Stalin 
took away all the few 
pennies which we got it together.  And I went 
on a trip to Belgium because of the fact 
that they asked me .  The y want I should coul d come  there.  They want to talk with me  

about a new contract.  Because I am doing good 
and all that, I had to 
go to Berlin.  And I 
came in Berlin.  I have relatives.  My mother
 had a aunt living in Berlin, and she was a 
beautiful gi rl.  And the owner, her son, from the 
tobacco factor y --            who was a 
factory -- fell in love with her and they 
got ma rried, and she became a rich girl.  Then 
when my mother send he r a letter said want
 I should became a doctor and she should give 
me  a room i n her house.  We ll, and nothing coul
d be worked out with all that, with all the 

woma n.  And then in 1939, September 8th, I was in Belgium.  I was in Belgium to the 

factory.  I was making a contract for the Karm
ann Ghia.  Kristallnacht.  You heard about 
Kristallnacht?   It was the night
 of Kristallnacht.  I didn't know for nothing.  I came, and 
mother told me  and say I should take for her a
unt a kilo bada (ph) and to take some  -- a 
few cheese, and she felt sorry for you, poor rela
tives they had.  But I took it with me  and 

gave it to them, to my mother's aunt, and I 
run in not knowingly in the Holocaust in the -- 
not in the Holocaust , in the Kristallnacht.  What means -- Kristallnacht means crystal, 

breaking windows, breaking in, 
the burning stores.  Wa s a tr
emendous big store I was -- 
before the wa r I used to go there, and in hous
e father owned in Germany.  And in that 
store I used to -- anything -- they used 
to ma rk -- anybody who wants to ma ke money 
gets $5 when he come s in here -- in Israel a
nd goes to the colby (ph) store -- and go in the 
store and ask for a product and can't find it, gets
 5 ma rk.  A premium fo
r that.  That's how 
proud they were with each other.  And it was 
the next year I came there, but it was when 
it was Kristallnacht.  
All ready all over the streets "Juden    
         Traboden" (ph) for the 
Jews, the Jews not welcome.  The Jews cannotcome  no more into the store.  So we didn't 

go there no more, because they took away the ca
rs from the Jews and they took away the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
9 
 
businesses, took away the bank accounts.  Anythi ng they had, they lost it.  Then we 
stopped going.  And then Hitler 
-- I mean Churc hill used to -- on shortwav
e radio used to            
and tell Stalin, "Be careful, Stalin, you're 
going to lose your head."  And then, "Your 
good friend Stalin is getting prep
ared to fight you."  And this
 was Ribbentrop.  Stalin sent 
his secretary of state Ribbentrop and -- no, th
e Hitler sent Ribbentrop and Stalin sent 
Molitof (ph).  Molitof was for Stalin.  They 
had been getting together one against the 
other keeping -- they di dn't  know what was 
going on until Churchill got into the act and 
started World War II.  
 

Q:Let me  ask you a few personal questions here
.  You saw what was 
going on in Europe?   
 

A:Right.  

 

Q:You went back to Lithuania.  Did you have an
y sense that the life you had in Lithuania would 
change so dramatically?  
 

A:No.  We had -- We had a feeling that -- but to 
kill people, that the Lithuanians would kill Jews.  
Friends which have been with all our life, 
which I have been staying with them going 
through law school, I couldn't imagi ne that 
that should happen like that.  It was 
unbelievable, that we didn't  even -- I had 
a big opportunity to 
go, but I was already 
ma rried.  I had a little child.  Jay was four at 
that time, and I -- my hand was tied.  I still 
say, oh, it still not so bad.  It still only right now
 who is closed (ph) is
 the poor little Jews, 
and the poor little Jews used to come  to L
ithuanian to find a place of where to hide, 
where to live.  And I was in that time a young la
wyer.  I still could take cases, but I -- but 
they used to come  to me .  They open up a office 
in Vilnius.  Vilnius is the capital city of 
Poland right now, too.  And I've been working 
out with them papers 
that they should be 
able to go to Japan.  The only place that was 
open for the Jews to go in that time  was  for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
10 
 
Japan, and everybody was running.  But they had 
to get a visa, a visa from the Jewish 
Council.  And they find out about me , and, 
you know, some  of them had money to pay 
for my work and some of them didn't  have 
any money even.  There was -- or they moved 
-- or the council moved away to Latvia -- Ri ga was the capital for Latvia -- ran away 
there.  I had to go over with them to help th
em there.  It was -- it 
was rough.  But I still 
had my home.  I didn't have to worry about 
Hitler, nothing.  Only the Polish Jew had the 
problem.  That we knew through them that 
it's no good.  They came from Russia or from 
all this st uff -- the ol d timers, little towns, co
me fr om all over, run into Lithuanian to 
become a place where to live.  
 

Q:Let me  -- when you were talking a
bout getting the visas for Japan.   
 

A:Right.  

 

Q:Tell me  a little bit more about that.  Who were
 you working with?   Wa s 
that all legal or was 
that di fficult?  
 

A:No, it was not difficult, but two years ago it wasthe council who done -- what give visas.  He 
didn't have the right to give, but he give 
it the visa.  Nobody knows he gave out -- about 
5,000 visas he gave out.  It was not
 legal.  If it was legal to 
travel, it was legal to receive 
it.  But his governme nt didn't told him he s
hould give visas, but at
 the same  ti me  his 
governme nt also keep a closed eye, didn't see 
nothing what's  comi ng at all.  But that was 
a good ma n, and he decided to he
lp Jews, Jews in that --  
 

Q:Did you know hi m?   

 

A:I knew him -- right.  I knew him before the war.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
11 
 
 
Q: What was his name ?   

 

A:Oh, I can't tell you.  

 

Q: Wa s it Sugihara (ph)?   

 

A:I think some thing like that.  Why, you knew him?   You heard of him?   

 

Q:Yeah.  I was wanting to know a little more about him if you knew him personally.   

 

A:No.  I don't re me mber so much, no.  It was a lo
t of pain there, too.  I remember it was a case I 
received a visa for a tenor, 
a singer.  Schwartz was his name .  He was a terrific opera 
singer.  And he received a visa, but his na
me  was Silver.  And -- now I reme mber, the 
name  of Silver come  up a day before and t
ook away the wrong -- the visa with -- the me n 
had to get it, and he got it, the visa, and 
went to Japan.  Later on it was a little easier 
because Sout h Africa also had been gi ven some
 -- letting in some Jews and it wasn't  so 
bad.  Then -- well, one day hell broke loos
e.  Lithuanian or Kovno or Slobodka, was in 
the valley surrounded by mountains
.  Beautiful, beautiful in 
nature.  There was a little 
cabin with -- Napoleon built it, and there we
re a lot of people who was going -- all kind 
of talented people were going there in that
 little cabin painting a
nd writing.  It was a 
fa mous writer of All Mapoo (ph), and he wrote 
two books, it was about that little house.  
It was terrific.  And the univers
ity been built it there, the 
engineering departme nt.  When 
the party (ph) go and the people been livi
ng there.  And it was 
everybody were happy.  
Everybody been in its pl ace.  It was status 
quo for years.  And here, boom, Hitler didn't 

say nothing, didn't announce that they           .  In 
fact, Stalin -- Stalin was liv
ing in the           

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
12 
 
.  I was in Moscow from time of the war.  
I was the only for a month.  I had to go to get 
supplies.  Well, it's so much stuff of there to talk.  
 
Q: Wa it, I want to be clear on this.  
When the Russians took over in 1940 --  
 

A:Uh-huh.  

 

Q:-- you lost your money.  Did you continue in 
the motorcycle business or did you do some thing 
else?  
 

A:I couldn't.  The Russians confiscated ev
erything.  There was 
no private industry.  
 

Q:So what did you do?   

 

A:It was bad.  I went to work with older        
    already at the airport.  You see what's happened, 
Lithuanian didn't have a airport.  It was 
a big mud -- mud field.  When it used was to 
snow and water, they didn't have any ground.  And they had to have a airport because the 

war was going away in Moscow.  Hitler been
 pushing Stalin, that he wants to take 
Moscow and didn't have no airport.  That's  why 
they got to have a place to let the planes 
go, and that's  what he started with pushing strong.  But Moscow was saved by the 

Siberiacs (ph), they call it, small, little peopl
e.  They were me an, and they were ones who 
stopped Hitler by 15 miles from Mos c ow.  Coul
dn't move.  And that's why they start 
losing with Stalingr ad and start losing the war.

Q:Later.  Okay.   

 

A:Right.  

 

Q:All right.  So you said that 
everything changed when the German
s ca me  in; is that right?   
 

A:Right.  

 

Q:Can you tell me  what you we
re doing, what happened?   
 

A:You know, when the war broke, we all -- it wa
s on a Sunday morning.  We  all run out in the 
streets.  It was 5:00 o'clock in the morni
ng, and we  didn't know what's goi ng on.  We  was 
-- we get -- people got so lost.  They was 
running like wild.  Run into me , "What you 
going to do?"  Run into them, " What you going 
to do?   Are you going by train?   Are you 
going by boat?   How are you going to run away
?"  People got confused.  You wouldn't 
believe it.  You know, "What's happening? "  H
itler dropped two bombs.  One bomb they 
dropped right over the railroad bridge.  It's 
they wanted the bridge
 to be destroyed.  
Another one they dropped right by Slobodka.  Th
ere was a big field, that' what all the 
selection was, those who live and those who die.
  Then -- then people 
didn't  know wha t  to 
do.  And I was working in that time in the 
transportation company.  Worked with the 
transportation horse and buggies.  Ar
ound 50 horse and buggies, I don't know, got 
together, and I was their secretary, orga
nized the horse and buggy transportation 
committee, and we ma de a living from that.  It
's as long you were a tail (ph), you went in 
the system from Stalin, Stalin was happy.  Then he didn't bother us that we ma de a living.  

As soon as Stalin used to come  with the al
l kind of directions, you 
already lost.  You had 
troubles.  And then when the            in that time we had a week without a governme nt.

You see, even the Germans, the murderers, 
couldn't take it no more when they find out 
what the Germans -- the Lithuanians doing to 
the Jews.  They ma de pogroms.  You know 
what a pogrom is?   They been attacking th
em.  And if you had a street, you would go.  
You will go the long st reet, go from t he bridge going on the wa y -- there wa s a way going 
you could go to Moscow.  If you go to Moscow and you got a car and you can go fast, I 

can understand.  But here, they are going w
ith little children, pushing children's carts, 
pushing to Moscow.  But from Mos c ow -- 
from Kovno to Moscow was 1175 miles, and 
they going with horse and buggy.  And they'll 
never can reach there, because here was 
already flying the Germans airplanes dropping 
them over the walking people and killing 
people in the street.  You coul
d see here, boom, right lane al
ready send people been killed 
going to Moscow.  They couldn't go nowhere
.  You had to turn around and go back 
home .  We  had no choice.  And I had a little girl
, a little girl who was three months old.  I 
had to go with girl, and I had a horse and 
buggy, but the copper wheels they had before 
they were, and it wasn't .  I was the owner -- the 
  , not the owner.  The owner was Stalin.  
And I went there and I took him.  The r e was nobody.  "Where is the ma nager? "  The 

ma nager took also one and he run away.  Then I took that horse and buggy, and I went on 

the way to Moscow, but went until 50 miles I 
had to turn around and go back.  Then I go 

in back, Edna tells me  -- my wife tells me , "I got to have milk for the girl."  I went out to 

the farmer house and I talk with the farmer and his wife, see if they can sell me  some  

milk.  They sold me some milk.  And they 
said, "Where are you goi
ng? "   I say, "I am 
going to Kaunas."  "Don't  go," they tell me
, "Don't  go.  They'r e killing Jews, and they 

going to kill you.  You stay away from this ro
ad."  The farme r  -- I was lucky -- they told 
me .  And I told to Edna, I say, "You know, E
dna, we better go with the bad streets, 
second way road, not to go with the highway. 
 The highway we'll go, we 'll get running in 
with the people taki ng to the fortress where th
ey'r e killing Jews.  Isn't that the way -- we 
start going to the worser place.  Not to go fo
r the highway, but to go where the second -- 
second grade road.  And that saved our life. 
 And we came in Slobodka.  I see my father 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
15 
 
-- or my grandfather and Edna's father -- Edna's was the second, her mother ma rried 
twice -- going in front of us.  I say -- going 
face run into us.  I say, "What's the ma tter?"  
"Are you survived?   Gosh, you're lucky."  And 
I looked at Edna's father.  His hair is 
white.  He was a black-headed ma n, and he 
looked terrible.  I say, "What's  happened? "  
He said, "Don't ask.  There is -- they'r e still la
ying."  He said, "Las
t night they killed all 
the Jews.  They kill the blacksmith," whom 
I know, "and the printer," whom I know.  The 
man from the Zionist  organization, they kill
ed him.  They killed -- from house to house 

they been wa lking and kill now Jews            the st reet.  Killed close to a hundred people.  
And like it was terrible.  I went up in the 
attic and looked a little
.  All along the killed 
people laying in the back of the street.  And 
next day they we nt running, the Lithuanians, 
from house to house picking a group of murdered
 people, and the cemetery wasn't  too far, 
and they bury them and in probably grave.  A
nd it was terrible.  Si
nce then, I decide not 
to go out even for the street, and          
  I don't know it's interested.  I don't know.  It was 
very -- a very religious ma n ca me  to me .  Be
fore the war was a fa mous rabbi, Rabbi Itrac 
Elholan (ph).  They have here a lot of semi na
rs in that ma n's name .  He was a very, very, 
high educated, religious ma n.  
Called him Itrac Elholan.  A
nd his assistant, assistant 
rabbi, the assistant rabbi came to 
me.  I was home, and he tell me I got to help the Jews.  I 
said, "I got to help the Jews?   What are 
you talking about? "   He  said, "You got see 
Jordan.  We  got now a Gestapo lieutenant.  He
's  terrible, killing a
ll the people."  I say, 
"What you mean?   He say, "He's in charge over 
the Jews, and it's all give the right to the 
Lithuanians, do with the Jews what you want.  
Kill them.  Do them.  We want to liquidate 
the Jews people."  That's  what he say. 
 I say, "What do you want from me ?"  He say, 
"You had when you were in your younger days," he
 tells me  about this story of Esther in 

the bible.  You know, Esther.  You know Esther
.  And Esther also we
nt to Ahasuerus, to 
the king, and to Babylonians, and asked me rcy for the Jews then, and they survived.  

Haman was the murderer, the one to kill all th
e Jews, but Esther saved their life.  And it 
what he want now.  I got here in ghetto now
 such a beautiful girl and her husband, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
16 
 
she's willing to go and talk to Jordan he shoul
d save the Jews, not to kill the Jews.  And 
she don't care about her life.  They can kill 
he r.  She's going.  "What you want now? "   
"And now I want you" -- that I should go and ta
lk with Jordan, the German lieutenant that 
was in charge, and ask him for me rcy to help
 the Jews.  We ll, I say "Yeah, but the girl 
does it, and let's find out.  "Yeah," I say, "I'll 
do it."  I went, and I almost got killed right 
by his door.  You see, I open up the door.  I 
went into his office, and he say, "What you 
doing?   Wha t  you want? "  I say, "I got to speak 
to you."  And I tell (ph) him with his title, 
and -- Gestapo title, and he jump to his gun a
nd grabbed the gun and 
start shoot.  And he 
start shooting.  I run, and I took off right behi
nd the building and come  ba ck in ghetto.  I 
was lucky that that thing was cold, because 
in that time I seen -- we had a sexton in by 
the Gestapo building, what they call it?   What 
it was La Tucas (ph).  That is Ukus (ph) 
means let the Lithuanian Ukus, th crown depa
rtme nt from the Lithuanians.  And I come  
running, and they -- I see in there, they put in Je
ws  right in that La Tucas gate.  There is a 
big yard surrounded with the wire, barb
ed wire, and they put that place on 
fire.  And the            
stays and            go, and put it by the 
ma tch and blew up the pl ace.  And didn't the people 
to run out to save their life.  They didn't le
t us go, just stay and shooting them.  And they 
been catching Jews in the street and 
taking them to jail.  They call the  
           a jail.  They 
call it tomb.  They'r e packed up.  The jail full. 
 And here it was for a month in jail.  I was 
lucky to get out because I had a 
pack of cigarettes, but I have
 to give one cigarette at a 
time to certain people to see how
 to move out from the jail. 
 I got out of jail and come  
back home.   
Q:How long were you in the jail?   
 

A:A month.  

 

Q:A whole month?   Your fa mily, did they -- did you see them?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
17 
 
A:No, I didn't see them, but I didn't have no choice 
of -- I trying to go in there when I could.  But 
then it would start I si gned up for to work at
 the airport.  I work at the --  I will be 
agreeable to work at the airport, they could le
t me out from j a il.  But what's the thing, the 
Jewish people that were afraid to go to wo
rk.  And the airport was the worsest working 
place where the person can get -- how the ghetto
 exist?  The ghetto been existing from 
cabbage, what the Germans been giving the Jews
 for working for the airport.  The airport 
was a comp any, a German company, by the name of Mole (ph), Mole Company.  Mole 

Company to cover the building of fixing up th
at airport that they should have a place 
where to come  down wi th the planes.  And they used to have a rough time to get workers.  

Jews didn't want to -- wa nt to work.  They 
did not get nothing to eat and didn't get any 
place to work.  They say they'r e better one to ge t killed.  They don't want to go at airport.  

That's             what the wife tell before.  And they decide not to go to work.  So Jordan 
came hi mself one early morning and start -- and 
it was the four Jews.  They evading the 

place where not to go to work, and he kill all 
the four without even asking, nothing.  They 
didn't done a thing.  But he want to scare the Je
ws  when they gave the order to go to work 

to airport -- and at airport doesn't  me an nothing 
-- they got to go to work.  And then they 
ma de no choice, got to go to the airport.  Go
 to the airport to work was no picnic.  There 
was nothing to eat.  It's what I say.  They used
 to give us a lunch, cabbage with water.  
Once a mont h that's the little slice of meat, 
but it was horse meat.  They used to bring 
dead horses, killing them, and give them to the 
Jews for meat.  It was -- it was a terrible.  
But you didn't  have no choice.  I lost two finge
rs.  I've been staying and working -- the 
way they do it to ma ke the airport, to build th
e airport, they been br
i n gi ng gr a v e l  a n d put  
it in            full for the farmer to bring 
in so ma ny buckets of gravel, and put the gravel on 
top, and putting the 12-feet high -- no, it was 12 
-- they had 12-feet high.  No, 36.  It was 
I say 36 feet tall wooden block, and then on t
op of the gravel, and it would ma ke a hard 
surface, a hard bottom that the pl anes, the German planes, should be able to come .  And 

they stopped up to 15 miles from Mos c ow.  A
nd it was the night when I decide I better go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
18 
 
to the airport to work.  I don't want to go to work no more            brigade, we'd be 
package -- a package house.  We 'd be with 
-- all the Jews will be with me , too.  And I 
told Edna and I say, "Edna, I 
cannot -- I am going to the airpor
t."  And her father tells me , 
"I am going with you, too," and one of her brothe
rs.  Three of us, we went to work for the 
airport.  And every time  in the morning, 7:
00 o'clock in the morning, we used to come  
trucks, loading us up on trucks, and taking it
 to the airport.  And then we doing the 
all-day work until 9: 00, 10:00 o'clock at nigh
t, because they been pushing hard.  They 
needed the airport it should start functi
on.  And that what we been happy.  Happy was 
nothing to eat, but better than nothi
ng.  Airport was           .  We had a uncle, a farmer, 
and it was a rich farmer, because he had the ca
ttle and he had the horses.  And the farmer, 
a neighbor of his, he used to come  to him to his mother.  Old, old woma n.  She was in the 
80s.  Come  in to her and say, "Youngkalova (ph)
," it was her name , "
how is? "   "I'm in 
trouble, sir."  A woma n - -  the old woma n come  
a nd cry and say, "I need a cow.  We  don't 
have any milk to drink.  Nothing."  So gave
 him a cow.  "Go pick yourself out a cow and 
be happy."  Another one used to come  around, 
"We need a horse.  We  don't have a horse 
to work.  They are filled."  He'd been he
lping everyone, and they didn't forgot it.  You 
see, people nowadays             think when
 they head in the right direction, you bring -- you 
can teach him into be a murderer, and he'll become  a murderer.  You can also at the sa me  

time to teach them to be become  a rabbi, and he can be a rabbi.  It's like now we have it 

in Israel, Rabin.  Yeah, it's -- you can't blam
e everything on the murderer.  The murde r er 
been brought up ma ybe the wrong way with the      
     .  And I be saying it all the time.  
It's wrong, we been going in the wrong direction.  We ll, well, then got to -- then I am 

going and -- decide that to stay
 at the airport a lo
ng time, not so hot.  I am -- it's a very 
bad brigade.  I'll have to find me  another one.  In
 between time, then they, the           , 
decide I got to go to the Albert 
          , and ask what 
I would not succeeded.  I wouldn't  
help.  I would thinking.  But I am thinking.  I 
come  in and worked with the farmer.  He 
came in with a wagon of gravel, and I had to un
load it.  And then the girls used to take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
19 
 
them and shovel it with their father, and thei
r father would bring it up.  And it used work 
ma ybe by 50,000 people -- lots of soldiers and 
Jews -- and building the airport.  Then a 
ma n come s t o the wagon of gravel.  I ask hi
m, a Lithuanian, he's a Lithuania farmer, 
"Where are you from? "   He tells me , "I'm from       
    .  I say "           ."  The name  is 
fa miliar.  I sa y, "What you doing? "   And he sa
y, "I'm a far me r ."  "What you doing here?"  
He said, "We got a orde r from Hitler that we
 got to bring so many wagon of gravel, and 
he don't care were it be ."  I say, "75 miles away? "  
 He said what he cares.  It will take him 
a month to bring the wagon with gravel, but
 he going to have 10,000 wagon gravel to 
build airport.  That's all what he's interested
 in, that's the way he 
figure.  And I say, "Why 
-- you say           ?"  "Yes."  I say, "Could it be
 you are from           ?"  He say, "Yeah.  75 
miles from here."  I said, "Wait a mi nute. 
 Maybe you hear from the Jew by the name  of 
Itska Kolomi nski (ph)."  He opens up his ey
es.  "Yeah," and looks around, "He's a Jew."  
I say, "I know he's a Jew."  "Who is he?"  He
 say, "He's my neighbor.  Itska Kolomi nski, 
he never went in the ghetto.  He didn't  go in." I say to him, "Well, where is he now? "  He 

say, "He's in hiding.  We  hiding him.  The farmer 's already been hiding him because he  

done him so good and helped him.  They pay h
im back.  And they -- he been in hiding."  
And I say, "Can you take  a letter to him? "  He say "Sure."  And I took a piece of paper, I 

write up a letter.  I told him that his fa
mily already, he don't have nobody left, only me  

and Edna and Jay, because her parents she got into the           , they took away her family.  
So the rest of the fa mily, they only going to ta
ke it to           ; therefore, yes.  
 

Q: What period of time a r e you talking about 
now?   You're further ahead, aren't  you?   
 

A:Right.  Right.  I --  

 

Q:You're talking in 1943, now?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
20 
 
A:Right.  
 

Q:Okay.  I just wanted
 to be clear.   
 

A:Right.  Right.   

 

Q:Let you finish.   

 

A:And then I went -- we decide -- yeah, in that 
time decided take these little children, called a 
kinderatzen (ph), and they take
n and killed all the little ki ds
.  Then I told Edna, I say, 
"Well, we got to run."  She say, "What you m
ean we got to run?"  "You lost your family; 
you have nobody.  I got my fa mily, they also.  I ask, and we got to do some thing."  And 

we still organizing.  I say, "We got to go fast. 
 We cannot play.  We  got to move it.  We 
got to see to get out of that 
situation."  And she say, "Well, how are we going do that?"  I 
say -- I told her I sent  a letter to her uncle      
       and see what if come  the answer.  In a 
month, not quite a month, the farmer come  back and from her uncle a letter.  And he 

writes he's willing to.  He got to 
save the family.  It's all that's left.   Let's do something.  I 
say -- "You come  to here, and I'll try to protect
 you, to help you," the farmer said.  And 
we done it, run away from the ghetto.  
 

Q: When wa s this?   When did you leave the ghetto?   

 

A:1943.  

 

Q:Spring, fall?    

 

A:Nove mbe r .  Novembe r  26th.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
21 
 
 
Q:Now, all of this time, from the early part
 of the ghetto in the summer of 1941 until '43, you 
were working at the airport?   
 

A:Right.  

 

Q:The whole time?  

 

A:The whole time.  I think that -- it was hard 
to get in good place.  You didn't have no choice.  
You got to work.  That's all 
I got -- started up with the polic
e, and they say not to go to 
work.  They say it's terrible.  And then we 
got to go in and fight, and start fighting with 
all that me ss.  Even I have a lot of people w
ho I knew very well, with whom I went to the 
school together.  Here's  Golub.  You ma ybe 
heard.  You got it -- you talk yesterday here 
about a book he wrote about a ghetto, ghetto da
y by day, and he's become  now professor.  
 

Q: What is the name  we know hi m by?   

 

A:You'll know hi m by the name  of - -
 he wrote a book, ghetto day by day.  

 

Q:Right.  Are you talking about Avraham Tory?   

 

A:Right.  Avraham Tory.  that's it.  You me t him?
  He went to school with me  in high`school, in 
college.  He's also a lawyer.  We  we nt to all -- and 
he was -- what is the Gestapo?            .  
No, I forgot his name .  The head of the Ge
stapo.  He was his secretary.  Golub was -- 

Avraham Golub, Tory, was his helper
.  Well, and -- what I stop --  
 

Q: We ll, you were saying that you knew a lot of people,
 but you still were work
ing in the airport.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
22 
 
 
A:Right.  Right.  We ll, then, we took -- I wrote a letter
 to an uncle that we wa
nt to come to him.  
And he hired -- he got another farmer, wh
ich he helped a lot.  Marches (ph).  
 

Q:Okay.  I don't want to get on that quite yet.   

 

A:Right.  I know what you --  

 

Q:I want to ask you a lot more
 about the ghetto life.   
 

A:Right.  

 

Q:And we have a few more mi nutes on this 
tape, so should I just ask you some  --   

 

A:Yeah.   

 

Q:Okay.  When you -- when the ghetto was forme
d, you were already living in that area or you 
had to move ?   What happened?   
 

A:No.  I was living already in that area.  I forgot
 it.  What the biggest problem, it's what's should 
come up and I forgot to mention to talk, and I 
got to talk now, is the selections, left and 
right, who should live and who should di
e.  I got to go over that, too.  
 

Q:Yeah, we'll get to all of that.  But I'm just tr
yi ng -- let's go back a little bit to the summer of 
1941 and how the ghetto came about.   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
23 
 
A:Right.  Well, after the pograms and after the L
ithuanians got happy and killed the Jews, they 
decide, the Germans, to get over, and the 
Germans start get bringing more to order, 
because they find out that way, the way the Lithuanians went , they'll never accomplish 
nothing, and it would be bad for the Jews and ba
d for the Lithuanians.  They got -- they 
got to get it straight, and it's what they st
arted to straighten them up.  And t hen we 
decided to run out of ghetto.  One night I got 
Jay ready and talked to
 Edna , talk to him a 
couple time s.  But he was a kid, five years.  
I got to get him in his mi nd that he should 

listen, because we were afraid to take  a
nd do some thing.  And the only way we could 

take him out from the ghetto was to put him in -- in the small ghetto was a place where 

they run -- people been running out from the 
s ma ll ghetto to the big ghetto.  And that's  
the way they survived, together 
they run out in the part of L
ithuania in the fi elds, in the 
woods.  Oh, but Hitler decide
d he got to kill every one, 
and Himmler gave the victory 
order to get the Jews locked up and get rid of
 them, to have the Ninth Fortress, and they 
got to kill them.  The first thi
ng they done is get a order that 
the Jews not allowed to walk 
the sidewalk.  They got to use the gutter.  Th
ey walk in the gutter.  The Jews, the second 
decree -- Hitler was in Golub's book, I think, 
saying the same  thing.  The second degree 
was when the Jews got to wear the star of 
David on the front and in the back.  Why on 
both sides when the one side would be enough
?   They say, no, when they see a Jew they 
got to kill him.  That is a point where they
 set up the shotgun or the rifle to -- star of 
David, to kill him.  And a Jew doesn't  have 
the right to have a car.  They took away the 

cars from them.  A Jew don't have the right to
 ha ve a secretary, to have an accountant to 
work for him.  Nothing.  And it was rough.  But -- and the Jew -- and the ma in thing, they 

got to go to work at the airport.  And we'
ll pick them up 7:00 o'clock in the mr ning every 
day and take them to the airport to work.  A
nd it was also the airport there to work.  It's 

Jordan, he wa s the one in that time.  He wa
s Miller, the head from the Gestapo, he was 
his assistant.  And Avraham Tory wo
rked also with the same Miller.

Q:I -- unfortunately I have to stop

Q:Okay.  I just wanted to clar
ify a few points you ma de earlier. 
 You talked about trying to get 
out of Lithuania in the very beginning when
 the Germans came  in and how you were able 
to get horses and buggies and 
all of this, even though it 
didn't work.  Why is -- did 
everybody have that opportunity?   
 

A:No.  You see, when the war -- on a Sunday 
morning, the Germans were commencing to drop 
two bombs: the one on the way to the bridge 
and another one right cl
ose to the ghetto.  
And they were what scared the living out of
 ma ny people.  This special bomb must be 
such a blast that everybody not 
run out -- fall out from bed a
nd come  running out outside.  
And didn't know what to do, had the people li
ke crazy.  It ma ybe was thousand people in 
the street waiting for a solution.  Some body said 
"Help them."  Even it got so confused is 
when the younger couples who was, where they 
only had to go to the railroad station.  
The communists kept  a train at
 the train station for almost
 a full day begging everybody 
to go in the train and go to Moscow.  They wa
nt to -- they are willing to carry them to 

Moscow, and the train wa s staying there.  
And they wait and they didn't go and they 

didn't use their opportunity and th
ey got killed.  You see, ot
her ones went with horse and 
buggy.  Wh ere they got the horse and buggy?   Th
ey had a cooperative, a cooperative, to 
tell the Russian people.  They had to tell 
what all the private horse and buggy people.  
Like I got uncles, my three uncles, they were owners.  The horse and buggy they want 

only to belong to the cooperative, because they
 were afraid for the Russians.  They sa y 
who -- those who work, those who eat.  And th
ey were so scared that they don't go get 
any food, that they board a horse and buggy 
and joined up into 
the transportation 
cooperation that they should say that they got
 some  work and they been doing work.  And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
26 
 
work, what they ma de a living out of it.  
And how is me  by being educated?   And I got 
my two uncles, three uncles, right in the 
board of that cooperation.  Through their 
influence, I been accepted on the job to be 
their bookkeeper.  Then I went carrying their 
books, and I got calls, people been calling in. 
 They want to br ing -- they found each 

other, they want to bring up a safe on firs
t floor, on the second floor, all that kind of 
work.  They used to call me in.  I used to give
 it all to the dispatcher
s, and they used to do 
the work.  And then it's the way we'v e been 
working with the transpor tation.  With me, if 

you had a place like a stable, a lot stable, 
which we kept about 30 horses with wagons, 
and people were running to that place there 
for a horse and the wagon.  They go off with 
the horse and wagon.  Was going to Moscow, goi
ng to save hims elf in Moscow.  Going 
1800 miles, go over in the horse and wagon.  Th
ey didn't realize they what foolishness 
they were trying to do, but when a person is s
cared and the devil is after him and chasing 
him, they don't have no choice.  They do a lot of things what is not real for a regular 

person.  But they done it.  The Germa ns were
 on top flying over the 
heads with the little 
planes.  Lithuania only had two paper cups, I 
call it, two of them.  They di dn't have any 
more.  It was a poor nation.  That's  all they ha
d.  They had eggs plen
ty, chickens, turkey.  
That kind of items they have: food to eat.  And 
that's  what they struggle even right now, 
here right at the present time , with the    
        and all what's going on.  There the 
Lithuanians all struggle to the Russians.  Can't 
help it.  They'll have to have a war.  I don't 
know why.  I hope not, but what the way it's happened, the wa y it's going on, it's big 

troubles.  Because the Russian who been born 50 
years ago is now a ma n of 50 years.  He 
ma y be educ ated, ma ybe he's a doctor, a lawyer, and here he cannot practice no more and 

he's  got to move on.  And he say, "What, it's 
my country."  He say, "I wa s born here."  
And you see this all comi ng up.  It's all kind of problems is developing.  And the 

Lithuanians from their side was trying to do 
the best they can, a
nd they can't do it and it 
doesn't  work.  We ll, when they got in, the Ge
rmans, and the Lithuanians lose, it were the 
Lithuanians done the biggest mi stake: kill the 
Jews.  It's not kill the Jews; it's destroyi ng 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
27 
 
the Jewish nation.  The Jews done so much good 
for them.  And even right now they been 
going and asking in Israel for help, because th
ey got to go to Fr ance, they got to go to 
England, they got to go the States, seeing 
that to recognize their independence, to 
recognize them as a nation.  I one time ca me  to the German Council in Ri chmond, and I 
was right at a meeting speaking to us, and I ask him a question.  I say, "Would you tell 

me  what's  happened to Kennicksburg (ph)? "   Ke
nnicksburg is one of th
e largest cities in 
north Germany, and there was a populati
on of around 5 million German, and the 
Lithuanians took in ma ybe 5 million Germans.  It wouldn't be a Lithuani a.  And the 

problem is -- the United Nations all have 
problems how to get it st
raight again.  It's  
headaches -- Europe is in problems.  
 

Q:Right.  Okay.  But --  

 

A: We ll, then, they came.  When the Germans decided to ge t the force, the labor force, was we 
were locked up, 17,000 Jews, in Slobodka before 
the war started with Hitler and Stalin.  
And they -- I got to think.  
 

Q:Let me  -- let's go back a mi nute.  I've now learned that you were -- you had a good position in 
the transportation cooperative, because 
of your education and your uncles and your 
fa mily.  Wh y did some body in the community co
me  to you in the beginning to go talk to 
Jordan?   
 

A:Jordan was the lieutena nt.  

 

Q:Yeah.   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
28 
 
A:Because they -- that rabbi knew me  personally fr
om way before the war.  He was the President 
Smetona's good friend.  And anything -- when he
 had to write a letter or some thing or 
some thing to ask the President Sme t ona for he
lp, he used to come  to me  and ask me  I 
should write him in the Lithuania language a lett
er.  Or when he used to send a letter to 
Roosevelt right in the States, he
 used to come  also to me  and ask me  to help him to write 
in English, even when I didn't know the Engl
ish language.  He didn't took "No" for an 
answer.  I say, "Your own sister-in-law works 
for Shell," Shell company, t he gasoline.  I 
say, "Why don't you go to your own sister-in-law?   She can help you more in this case 
than I can."  But he didn't want to.  He  want 
me .  And I couldn't  help him.   To satisfy him 
I say maybe I'll -- maybe he's an ordinary person who got feelings.  I'll go.  What am I 

going to lose?   More so than th
e death, it couldn't be.  And I went.  And I went to the side 
streets.  I know to the univer
sity was right there.  Then I 
used to go every night and knew 
the places where to go.  I went, but 
I almost got my head cut off.  
 

Q:So because of your education, you were able to
 help people in ways that ma ybe some  people 
could not?   
 

A:Not, no.  I couldn't.  Everybody had -- in the gh
etto was such a life th
at everybody got to help 
themself.  You don't help yourself, y
ou lost.  And nobody could help you.   
 

Q:So after a while the education di dn't  matter?   

 

A:Didn't ma tter.  It ma tter was 
a good little corner wh
ere there is room in the living, can serve 
you a loaf of bread for a -- a 
two pair of stockings for a 
woma n.  Or earrings, with a 
golden earing.  You see, when also the German
s come  out with the decree, they want to 
have the Jewish people should gi
ve all their gold, jewelry, and 
diamonds, to turn it in into 
the central  co mmittee.  And they -- later on th
ey'll have new orders, and when they got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
29 
 
that order, and the Jews, not so dumb, were gi
ving away all their valuables for they had it 
for years.  Then some of them -- one was my
 father-in-law.  Took out a brick from the 
wall, and done such a beautiful job that you couldn'
t tell.  He put in his gold     watch, he 
putting in -- his wife had a chain, a golden 
chain around her neck that's  plain solid gold.  
He took that and put it all in the hole from 
the brick, and put it over with tape, taped it up, 
and you couldn't even tell.  And it come  up a fte
r we come  after we got liberated, we went 
and got to find the gold pieces right in the wa
ll where he put it in.  And then it was -- 
well, this is one item.  And then we went a
nd then to go to work at the airport -- no, it 
was the second time, then the Germans decide
d they got to have the airport still done, 
with the company, it was a German company, 
been building the airport.  And everybody 
had to go to work regardless.  It took a
ll the brigades and turn
 around and send all of 
them to the airport delivering 
gravel to help the airport done
.  And they done it in a hurry, 
in no time, but they work day and night.  
And one brigade I work at night, I cut my 
fingers off.  
 
Q:Let me now, let's just talk a
bout the ghetto for a while; okay?   

 

A:Okay.  

 

Q:If you don't mi nd.  You said before that after 
the Germans took over there were all kinds of 
laws, what Jews could and could not do.  Then soon after, did they decide you had to go 

live in a ghetto?   When did that happen?   
 

A:No.  They -- all of they gave that the Jews 
had the right they should 
build theirself a ghetto.  
And what they done from the Jewish people thei
rself, to pick out a large brigade, what 
they went in in the ghetto with barbed wire
 in the section with 
27,000 Jews lived in it.  
They surrounded them with barbed wire, and 
had Jewish police with helpers staying there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
30 
 
at the gate, where you going in and going out 
from the ghetto, stayi
ng there and helping 
the Germans who getting already there -- you sa
y to German soldier and just stay the 
Jewish with young me n, and all da y long stand by
 the gate to help each other how to not 
to run in any troubles.  To help there shoul
dn't be any shooting, shouldn't be any killing.  
And then that's the way they stay there and 
build the ghetto.  And not that the ghetto was 
finished.  Was in August`15, 1941, that's  when th
ey got finished, and th
ey started in June 
29th in 1941.   
 
Q:Now, did you have to m
ove into this ghetto?   
 

A:No, I didn't, because I lived there already.  My
 whole fa mily -- my fa mi ly and Edna's  fa mily, 
we all were in that  same apartment.  We ha
d been sleeping four, five people in one room 
on the floor, but we didn't  want to move awa
y.  You stay -- better stay in the one place 
and not to keep moving around.  And we -- we been there all the time .  Si nce I got 

ma rried, I was in together with them, and we 
stay all in the same  place.  And only when 
they need the help -- they used to come , 
the Germans, right on the corner where I lived, 
come  with trucks and pick them up a nd take
 them to work.  And one thing would just 
happen.  Wh en they come  with trucks to 
work, it can -- this idea was fr om the mayor 
from Kovno, from Kaunas, came with a smart id
ea.  He come to Jordan, and told Jordan 
that he got to do -- to get more people to
 do work, and the people are not comi ng.  
Some thing, they got to do to keep them movi
ng.  And they came  in one day and shot four 
people by the gate by comi ng in and going out 
to scare the Jews.  
And when they all 
come  here, they shouldn't run, they should goto work.  And it come  -- he come  up with 

the idea that he need 530 -- 500 people he n
eed first.  And he got to have young people.  
What he need them?  He need them for the 
archives, because  of the communists run away 
and left behind him so many papers, so ma ny 
archives, in the Russian language, and the 
Jews knew Russian language perfect, that th
e Jews should go and help the -- how to take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
31 
 
out the paper and check them, and then know wh
at's all about them in the paper.  And 
who was idea is?   The idea was 
themayor from Kaunas; he s
uggested it.  And they took 
five -- placed the 500 -- 534 people came .  
And all of the 534 young 
people -- boyfriends 
of mi ne, cousins of mi ne , a lot of people w
hom I knew, a lot of them I went to school 
together.  All this appeared at night and ev
erybody was there.  They kill them the sa me  
night.  Whe n they took them out 7:00 o'cloc
k in the morning, by 10:00 o'clock at night 
they all were dead.   
 
Q:Now, why didn't you have to go with them?   

 

A:That's what I don't know.  A powe r  in me  told me
 not to go.  I just unti
l this day ask -- rabbis 
ask people why I didn't -- I stayed with them.  And there was my house.  And I told it to 

my buddy next to me , I say, "You know, I kind of
 feel funny.  I don't think I'll go."  He 
say, "You're crazy.  What you going to do all day long here with the woma n.  They'll run 

you nuts.  Where my hus band, where is this and that.  Stay here.  They don't come  in time 

back, it will be murder."  But, I said, "Nope. 
 I'm sorry.  I'm not going.  You want to go 

with me , let's go."  "No," he say, "I'm going," an
d he went with them.  And I went back to 

the office from the committee.  Wh at we cal
l them?   You know, I went to the central 
committee office with Dr.`Elkes, the head ma
n was there, and Avraham Tory, his office 
was there.  I went back there 
and to find out what's going on.  I come  in there.  There is a 
good friend of mi ne and a good friend of Edna, 
worked for his brother.  He gives me  -- 
grabs me  and he want I should go with the 534. 
 And some thing in me  gets me  power  in 
me , I should get rid of him.  I say, "Now, look 
Isaaci (ph) " -- his name  wa s Isaac.  I say, 
"Don't play with me .  I come  to ask you wh
at's going on with 534?  
 What's happening to 
the young men?   What do you want me  to push there?   What's the interest you got in 

me ? "   He say, "Look, I don't want nothing.  You 
go with them."  And it ma de me  hot.  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
32 
 
had -- I had to knock him in his nose.  I didn'
t want to do him any harm, but he -- my life 
depended and he stops me.  It was three,
 four cases like this in the ghetto.  
 
Q:So nobody forced you or --  

 

A:He forced me ?   Nobody forced me, no.  No.   

 

Q:Now, all of the people who didn't 
live in the ghetto ar ea before --  
 

A:Uh-huh.  

 

Q:-- how did they come in?  I mean, how did they find places?  Was there some organization to 
help them?  
 

A:No.  It was going -- because Hitler or the Ge
stapo let them until August 15 we got to have a 
ghetto cr eated.  We got to have al so until Sept ember`15 a br idge made, and then they 

went to -- we  went to work.  The people who didn't live in the ghetto who went to work 

and helped build the ghetto, because  they find out
 that is safer, because they say they've 
been guarded by the German, guarded by the Jews , and we don't have to worry about it so 

much at night when you go to sleep that some body will wake you up and take you out 

and beat you and kill you and all, what they
 call it, selections.  
The 534 was a selection.  
They picked out the young me n, and it is th
e cream of the crop for ma ny reasons.  Not 
only for the paperwork, but they were a power. 
 It was an underground it was in the 534.  
It what the ghetto needed, and the young peopl
e understood it, but they 
were not ready.  It 
wasn't  so simple to do.  But the ma in reas
on was that they should 
be organized to get 
some thing to fight the Ge rman befor e  they go in the ghetto.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
33 
 
Q:Okay.  But all of the people who ma ybe lived 
not in Slobodka before the war, they had to 
come to the ghetto al so?  
 
A:Right.  

 

Q:Did anyone help them or did they just 
sort of come  over there and find places?  
 

A:No.  It was like one went to the other neighbor or a friend whom he knew or a friend who 
came in and swapped the houses, swapped room
s.  It been swapping.  "Here you take 
mi ne in the corners, and I'll take you what
 you outside out by the field."  They been 
swapping between theirself, and nobody helped
 them and nobody bothered them.  It was 
a big mi stake and it was a big mess.  Ever
ybody was running, doing anything they can to 

help theirself or help the other one.  It didn't 
work.  Then they stop it.  St arted -- and they 
find out that they don't have enough space.  Th
ey got to have a bigger, larger ghetto.  

They had one large ghetto and they had one small ghetto.  The small ghetto was 5,000 

Jews, and the large ghetto was 27,000 Jews.  And to go in the small one, they didn't have 

enough mor e  room, since a lot of Jews were -- because Germany decided to send Jews 

from Austria, to send Jews from other countri
es, to Lithuania, to 
Kaunas, to the Ninth 
Fortress, that killed the Jews, and it was the 
selection.  And they build a bridge from one 
ghetto to the other, from the small one to the 
big one.  And in the bi
g one they still have 
room to put in, but in the small ghetto they 
didn't have no mo re.  And I -- what they done, 
they told everybody, all small and 
big, say, "Go out in the large 
field."  It was where they 
were building the airport.  It's  where they ha
ve the -- what they call it?  Rockstaten (ph) , 
the work places.  And they all been sent ther
e.  But there they got a select, and the name 
-- a German soldier by the name 
of Rauca -- Jay got his pictur
e of a writeup with him.  
He was the head of the selection.  And he had 
the help of the Lithuanians.  They helped 
to guard so the Jews shouldn't run.  And th
ey was directing the Selection A and B, big 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
34 
 
ghetto and small ghetto, who should live and wh
o should die.  And then after everybody 
come around and stay there all morning.  I w
ill never forget.  From 5:00 o'clock in the 
morning until 10:00 o'clock at night without 
food, without water, without nothing.  Andit 
was little children, sick people, unbathed.  It 
was a terrible picture,
 seeing the way they 
been mi streating.  Mistreating 
-- the people wanted they should
 be shot, but they didn't -- 
surrounded them with machine guns around the 
all -- around the ghetto, and they kept 
them all day.  And then Rauca come  around with
 a little stick, like you would play music, 
play an orchestra, directing all what
 to do, and asked everybody's occupation, 
everybody's name .  And then after a while, we
 seen a German on a motorcycle come 
running and told Rauca someth
ing.  And Rauca gave the or
der, "Everybody home .  We 
don't need it.  Go home ."  We ll, they were 
trying to, the Germans, to find out how mu ch 
time and what kind of power it will take to cont
rol a situation like this, because they we re 
afraid for the balance of the Jews.  Afte
r all, about 40,000 or even 30,000 Jews, it's a lot 
of people.  They cannot take and 40,000 and 
shoot them out.  Some body will get ahold of 

guns and some body will get ahold of machine gu
ns, and in worse cases like that it's not 
so shameful.  We ll, then they send everybody 
back.  And wha t  the religious Jews was 
say, they were saying, "Here is 
a God" -- I mean "the hand of God.  God s a ved the Jews."  
And they all -- they all go and -- and we all Je
ws start praying, and God is the one.  Jews, 
you listen, and all that.  The orthodox, and they 
were so happy.  "You see, we still have a 

God.  God s a ved us."  And I reme mb er it lik
e today they been saying.  And they send us 
back home.  And this was the small ghetto 
was liquidated, but they had a bridge ma de.  
The bridge to bring in the Je
ws fr om the small ghetto to the large ghetto, all the same 
time fr om the large one to the small one, 
and started Selection Number`2.  The big 
selection, which was October`28th, 1941.  That's
 when they had the big selection.  And, 
again, comes the case, I am with all my famil
y, with my fa mily and with Edna's  fa mi l y, 
all together.  That the way they had it, in
 groups.  They want, they pick out -- every 
groups they pick out a head an who is the ta
lker, who can talk with
 the Germans, but not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
35 
 
everybody should go come  and complain of say th
is and that.  And I was selected by the 
Germans that I should be the speaker fo
r my group.  In my gr oup it was around 30 -- 30, 
35 people.  And he asked me  my oc cupation.  And I -- the power in me  tells me I 
shouldn't say a word that I am a lawyer.  I should only me ntion about my  occupation.  

What occupation I had when it's all I know is, 
all I learn, it's all my occupation?   But the 
power still tells me , don't say a word.  A
nd then he start hollering, "I asked you your 
occupation."  He hollers a little           
.  We ll, power tells me  I should say I'm an auto 
mechanic.  And I say, "I am an automobile me c hanic."  And when I say "automobile 

mechanic," he holler, "Right.  All groups go to
 the right."  They say this, "To the right 
should leave, and the left die."  And all the 
left people, the 5,000 that night, been killed, 
every one of them.  My uncles and I have lo
ts family, and everybody been dead, killed.  
The children, the cousins, raped and all. 
 It was terrible.  And that's  it.   
 

Q:So your whole family stayed?   

 

A:They stayed.  

 

Q:At that time ?   

 

A:Right.  

 

Q:Now, in this big selecti
on, where did it take place?   
 

A:Vonugas (ph), a large country fiel
d.  It was a big farm, a lot of far m, a lot of acres of land, and 
there they brought us all up.  It used to be 
the horse ma rket and all ki nd of place, all kind 
of business places.  
Q.    How di d people get there?  We r e  th
ey told in advance what was happening?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
36 
 
 
A:They don't care.  They say, "You got to be there  

7:00 o'clock in the morning.  How you get there is 
your headache."  They say they don't have to 

worry about it.  

 

Q:So at that time everybody went?   

 

A:Right.  

 

Q:Nobody thought about stayi
ng home  and hiding?   
 

A:Right.  Nobody was staying home as sick.  They 
killed them right in bed.  They did stayed 
home , but they killed them.  The Ges t apo camein, the Germans in there, and killed them.  

They also killed some  of them they called got to be in
           .  It 
was like a bath, they take 
a bath.  And they say, "Oh, you need a bath.  Go in there."  And they go in there, and 

Gestapo kill them.  That kind of problems they
 had.  We ll, this was the worsest.  After 
this is over, it got a little re
laxed after they killed out over ha
lf and start all over.  And it 
still stays in front of my eyes.  I can see the 
way they passed.  I was 
right at the corner.  
They going mostly by alphabet.  The letter "I" 
wa s right in the mi ddle.  I could see my -- 
the rabbi fr om my temple, they bring the president fr om the temple, a lot of older people 

mostly.  They bring older, the old ones, they
 killed out.  The young 
ones they still kept 
because they need them.   
 

Q:So you saw them actually leaving?   

 

A:They going from the big ghetto to the small ghetto.  The small ghetto was empty.  And there in 
the small ghetto it was not so easy -- in the be
ginning not so easy to get in.  You had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
37 
 
have            , a round number.  You were
n't no more after death.  
The selection, after that, 
they didn't have no more when the person, whether he had Number 10, Number 50, 
Number 57, Number 80, that kind.  And since Iregister myself as automo bile me chanic, 

one morning, I assume it was the two days la
ter, a German come running with Number 
570.  It was me.  He said "Come report to th
e gate."  The Jewish bodies had to deliver 
right away.  And they come  right away runni
ng and told me  I got to go to work at the 
airport.  Well, they took me.  I had to go to
 work, because I'm a mechanic.  Because there 

I came, and they told me  what to do.  And I wa
s also lucky.  It's a luck.  I'm standing with 

the forema n on a truck, it was a German.  A Ger man army soldier come  into the forema n 

with a pickup truck.  And he say he has trouble
.  The truck isn't running right.  He talks to 
the German, the forema n, can we help him.  The fore ma n called me  up, " Come here.  

Talk with him and ask him what he wants."  I go
 to him, ask what he wants.  He tells me  
he has trouble with his truck, it 
doesn't  run.  I've got do some th
ing about it.  I said, "Well, 
let me see."  He start it up.  I didn't hear 
nothing.  I said, "Tell you 
what I'll do.  I can to 
lay down on the floor and you drive slow a
nd over me , and I'll see what is knocking 
there."  I heard a knock.  We hear it.  He say okay.  And he say when will I be able to 

have ready.  I say a couple days.  He say, 
"Oh, no.  Can you do it earlier?   I'll give you a 

good loaf of bread.  I mean, you can do it?   I have
 a farm not far from here, and I want to 
run up to see what's going on home ."  "I'll do my  best," I tell him.  And I do.  And I lay 

down, and I seen a big pipe with the universal jo
int with the dr ive shaft is loose, and I use 
my head.  I say, "What I am doing -- I moved it.  It wasn't  the newer kind of car; it was 

the old late model Ford.  And I took it out with
 my hand.  It was loose.  And I go into the 
German, and I tell them I need a universal joint,
 and they bring me  th
e part in stock.  And 
he sa, "Look, I can't  understand.  Te ll me , how do you took off a drive shaft with -- so 

long with so little bolts 
with a big tools.  I gave you a sc
rewdriver with a pipe wrench.  I 
told him, I say -- you see, you all the time you got to be 
in your            .  And I told him, 
"Well, I had it here, it was so loose, the pipe
, that I didn't have to have any wrenches.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
38 
 
With my fingers I took it off and it got loos
e," and that's  what I wanted.  "Oh, I can 
understand now."  He understood.  He gave me  
the parts, and I became the best mechanic 
in the Gestapo.  
 
Q:I need to take you back cause I have a fe
w mo re questionsabout
 that big action.   
 

A:Uh-huh.  

 

Q:Did -- you had a Jewish government in pl ace a
nd you had Jewish police in the ghetto.  What 
was their involveme nt in these actions?    
 

A:The Jews?    

 

Q:The Jew -- the Judenrought (ph).  Those people 
and the people on the Jewish police force, did 
they have any involveme
nt in this action?   
 

A:Not.  

 

Q:Did they help?   Did they try to help Jewi
sh people?   Did they help the Germans?   
 

A:I don't think -- I don't think it was in -- it wa
s rumors was comi ng around that the Jewish 
police knew where children hiding places were
, and they reported it to the Gestapo, and 
-- because to save their own skin that there, th
at's all they had.  They didn't want to get 
involved or some thing.  They just point th
e place where you can see Jewish kids been 
laying in hiding and been killed.  That's th
e kind of rumors I had -- I heard, but I don't 
know.  I cannot verify, I can't  say nothing because I don't know.   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357

Q: We re they present at the select
ion, the leaders of the Jewish 
Council?   Were they present?  
 
A:Before.  The leaders of the council, there wa
sn't too ma ny.  The only one was Tory, and it was 
Dr.`Elkes, and Tory had a secr
etary woman.  It's  all it was. 
 That was the council.  And 
one was by the door, the Isaac, who di dn't let me  in to ask him find out what's going on.  

About five, six people.  
 

Q:So were they there at th
e time  of t he big action?   
 

A:Yeah, yes.  

 

Q: What were they doing?   

 

A:Nothing.  They didn't done nothing.  They -- th
ey didn't bother the police.  The police saying 
at first they had to have a working permit,
 and to get a working permit was hard.  It 
wasn't  so easy.  They been paying -- buying wo
rking permits, because they been told the 

person with a working permit his life is secu
red.  They don't go do nothing to them; he'll 
survive.  And they been giving us a worki
ng permit Number 537, and 537 is Israel Ipson.  
And it was been already 537 in the           
, in that departme nt.  
They been making it for -- 
in a mi nute for you.  They had the special prin
ting ma terial and they be printing up 537.  
They ma de 721 and they ma de --  and it the 
way it went.  They had it ma de.  And then 
everybody was trying to go to the police because the city police don't bother.  They ha ve 

enough troubles the way the average person ha
s it.  But nobody can go into the police.  
They didn't took it.  They want me .  Why they
 want me ?   First thing, I was born there in 
that pl ace, raised in the place. 
 I knew every little corner, ever
y little hole.  They need me , 
but I say, "No, huh-uh.  You don't go get me .  I don't 
want it.  I'd rather go to the airport."  
But then, that's my help me too, by not going in
to the airport.  Some
 of them say, " Well, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
40 
 
we cannot keep Ipson so long.  He been so ma
ny years already here. 
 We  got to give him 
a better job.  It's not fair.  We got to recr
uit all the work on his shoulder.  We got more 
Jews got to go to the airport.  We  swap it."  
We ll, but that when I decided on to my uncle.  
 
Q:Okay.  We still -- I have a lot mo
re questions about the ghetto.   
 

A:Sure.  Go ahead.  

 

Q:All right.  So do you -- is th
ere anything more that you can 
tell me about these horrible 
actions, the -- what happened with the small 
ghetto or what happened with the big action 

at the end of October?   Is 
there anything else?   Could you 
see the people as they were 
actually leaving, leavi
ng the ghetto, walking out towards th
e forts?   Wa s that -- could you 
see that happening?   
 

A:A walk in the           , no.  I didn't see it
 happening.  It would be ve
ry, very rough.  And that's  
funny.  The Germans -- at the end of the 
Germans taking, there was a me mber by the 
name  of Lipzer.  Lipzer was a head -- a 
right ma n for the Gestapo.  It was a Jewish 
person.  I -- he became -- he was a nothing.  He 
was a television salesma n before the war.  
I knew him personally ve ry well.  And he b
ecame a big shot  because he wanted -- he 
want to go -- when some one been locked 
up by the Gestapo and going to Lipzer, Lipzer 

used to bring him out.  How he been doing 
it, nobody knows.  Had he been paid off, I 
don't know.  Used to save you some thing to the 
Gestapo, to Miller, for him for his wife a 
present, and take it out and    
  three.  But it was the ma in thing.  In my ca se, I felt a little 
better, but I didn't bother with him.  I stayed 
away from hi m.  I didn't want no part.  Like 
when they put in Edna in jail, and I don't know why she got involved with it with her 

mother.      ot in jail my sister, and they 
put him in jail by the ghetto.  It's a time -- and I 
had arranged to take him out from ghetto to 
run with him to keep the pl ace where to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
41 
 
work, but it didn't worked out.  I got
 another very, very,        
    terrible what happened.  
The worsest part of what happened with me  in 
ghetto.  I even don't want to talk about it.  
I had a cousin who worked for me .  He's  a 
very smooth operator by the gate.  He wasn't  
afraid for nothing.  He had been supplying 
to the ghetto population anything they want.  
A young kid.  He was around 19 or 18.  And he helped me  to go to the gate with Jay, 
because hi s house was also by the gate.  And he
 helped me  also to get to my far mer 
whom my uncle sent  to pick me up with Edna
, because they want to bring me  home .  And 
I see one day my -- it wa s a couple months later,
 my cousin is in my hiding place.  He 
came.  How he came, I find out; but where he 
get the idea, I didn't know.  I didn't want to 
have nothing to do with him.  Everything when 
he done for me, I paid him.  I just didn't -- 
wasn't  in me to have to do it, all this sm
oke-miray (ph), they call it.  But this time he 
come to me and ask me, "I need a favor." 
 He wants a favor from me .  I say, "What do 
you want?   I paid you for my favor to take me
 to the gate."  "Yeah, you pay me .  I don't 

want that."  I say, "When you want some body" -- 
he say he want to br
ing his brother also 
in my place where I am staying.  I'll agree wi
th that provided you can bring my mother 
with the si ster, with the ol
der sister.  You can bring th
em from ghetto to me , I 'll do 
anything you want."  He say "Okay."  I 
say, "But you reme mb er, you got to bring my 
mother," and I repeat him three time s.  A
nd I say, "Marches" -- who is the gentile who 
come  to pick us up.  I say, "Look, Marches, you see he should take my mother and 

sister."  "I don't know who they are."  I sa
y, "You'll find out."  He didn't.  He come  on 
board his other brother with his wife, bring 
her to me .  And I come  to the ghetto and I 

say, "Who a r e -- what you brought them for?   
Who the woman?"  "This is my wife," he 
say.  "But who give you the permission to bring 
them in here?   I didn't ask you to come ."  
It was the best hiding place.  It was mi ne.  W
hy?   It was in a safe.  The Gestapo wouldn't  
dream to fnd somebody.  A gentile should work
 so much to bring people out of ghetto, 
but he done it.  We ll, I got hot.  I said, "Now
, look.  I don't want no mor e  part of you.  I 
told you a bunch.  I don't want -- I want my
 fa mi l y.  I didn't have nothing do with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
42 
 
strangers.  Your wife, fine.  I don't have not
hing.  I'm not ma rried to your wife."  Didn't 
listen again.  And he come  with his less br
other and his wife.  
And something got him 
when they came  to a little town they had to go through to come to me .  It was Zezmer, 

Zezmer.  And go in three soldiers.  And th
at to them come s a wagon, and the wagon was 
my aunt -- the boy's mot her -- and his wife.  F
our already been with him;  two more came .  
And I'm seeing the soldiers, and they were th
inking that the soldie
rs go enough that they 
want to arrest him.  And 
they start running, about -- my aunt and my cousin, and the 
soldiers didn't  know what's  happening.  There we
re a big pile of hay.  It was the fall of 
the year.  And they got in the pile of hay, 
they were hiding in the hay, and the soldiers 

then come  around, took him out of t he hay, and s
hot him.  Killed him.  Took him not the 

same  day, next day.  Mother and son, pardon me .  Took him.  I can't  forget.  This is 

almost a fault of mi ne, when I would insist
 -- maybe they would be more easier, but I 
insist to bring my mother.  I wanted   
    to have some body.  M a ny, ma ny nights I don't 
sleep because  of that -- because of that.   
 

Q:Now, I want to go back to 
the ghetto a little bit.   
 

A:Okay.  

 

Q:Is that okay?   

 

A:Okay.  

 

Q: What -- you said that, you know, you worked in th
e airport outside of the ghetto.  Was there -- 
were ther e al so workers inside the ghetto?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
43 
 
A:Yes.  They had another.  There was a very inte
resting things outside of 
the ghetto inside of the 
ghetto.  It happened I had to go 
and bring the beer for the Ge
rman soldiers, but since my 
father worked in the brewery, my gr andfat
her worked in the brewery, they had the 
connections.  They knew each other, even 
in the ghetto.  There was the workers who 
worked with my father, came to hi m and it's 
what I -- it's terrible.  And he had only one 
suit.  He had a suit on hims elf.  One worker 
from the brewery, a gentile, he want he 
should come  to him and say, "Braetka (ph)" 
-- they call my father
 his name  Braetka -- 
"how's about selling me  your suit?"  He say, 
"We ll, I'll sell you my suit.  I'll buy me some 
cheaper suit.  I don't need" -- it 
was a cloth (ph) suit.  "Oka
y.  What how much you want 
to pay me ? "   He say, "I don't know."  He 
say, "Okay.  Tell you what you'll do.  I'll buy it 
for you.  I'll give you the suit, and you'll pay me
 for it."  "Oka
y.  What do you want?"  He 
say, "I want that loaf of br
ead with a half a pound butter for 
the kids."  "All right."  He 
comes in, he gives him a packet, and he goes aw
ay.  And wha t  they gave him?   A brick.  
A paper wrapped around a piece of br ick, and 
took away the suit.  And it was worker 
worked with him all his life.  He could fix hi
m, and I told him,  I say, "Don't bother.  I'll 
buy you another suit in ghetto, and don't bother 
with him.  Have nothing do with him. "  
That kind of people he been working with.  
 
Q: What was the -- was there an advantage to work
ing outside of the ghetto 
instead of inside the 
ghetto?  Which was the better job?   
 

A:Better -- naturally, it's better 
in the ghetto providing you have 
some thing to support yourself.  
Inside of the ghetto was the ma in thing, the 
ma lin (ph) what they call it, the working 
groups.  Vachstaten (ph).  The work 
places.  There was around 5,000 Jews working, 
because the Germans needed them very bad.  
They needed them to make loafs and to 
ma ke ears.  And they used to catch -- bring 
cats and dogs and killing them, and taking the 

ear covers and ma king ear covers from their sk
ins.  And they were bringing them in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
44 
 
places where they have been hauling the ca
ts and dogs was in synagogues, bringing them 
full synagogues dogs and killing them.  And 
there was already sitting sewi ng ma chines, 
ma king ear covers for their ears from the dogs. 
 And one day I come  to work -- I come  to 
work with my cousin.  I was the head of th
e brigade comi ng into the airport.  A German 
come  to us, and he tell me , he say, "Look, I wa
nt you to take me  to the ghetto."  I say, 
"What do you mean you want me  to take you to 
the ghetto?  I have nothing to do with it.  
Leave me  alone.  Stay away."  Next time he say, "You got to help me .  I can't get any 

beer.  I'm short of bottles."  And the German
s couldn't get any beer when they didn't have 
empty bottles.  "Well, I'll arrange that," I said, since I knew the people who knew my 

father.  And I told him, I said, "I need bottles,"
 and they arranged it to give me  three, four 
cases empty bottles, but for my boss to have beer           .  And one day, I seen the 
Gestapo ma n come  looking for me .  I got scar
ed to death.  I say, "Oh, this is the end.  
This time I no get out."  And who it was?   
It's funny.  The brewmeister from the brewery 
who it was before the war, who worked together
 with my father before the war, and now 
he became a big Gestapo ma n.  One of the bi
g, big ones.  And he was trying to find out 
his boss.  He want to see the Wolf brothers
.  The Wolf brothers, the six brothers, who 

helped build the brewery, and Ingleman, they was 
still --  two were still alive.  The rest of 

them were dead already.  And he came to bri
ng a package, the Gestapo ma n, that I should 
take over a package to one of his bosses. 
 And he was a philanthropic ma n, a nice ma n.  
And I took over a package, put it in ghetto, and 
I save it.  And if they going to catch me, I 
told them I got -- he give me  his card.  He
 say, "Don't worry.  When they going to catch 
you, give them this by the ghetto gate.  They'r e going to let you in.  Don't worry.  And 

they'll see in this card and know it was       
    ."  And then Mr.`Wolf ca me.  He came  
through friends of my father.  I told him, 
I say, "Look, help me .  Have your son bring me  
a package I got from Wolf, a package for me
."  And I had to deliver packages.  The 
Gestapo ma n used to bring packages for the 
Wol fs until the bi g selection.  That's when 
they killed him.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
45 
 
 
Q:You were saying that it was bette
r to work inside the ghetto?   
 

A:Yes.  

 

Q: Why is that?   

 

A:You didn't have to put up with guys -- at the gates with
 the guard, with the police. 
           with 
butter, with water,            you had not
hing to do with them.  When you worked inside the 
ghetto, you go from your ghetto place to your ho
me or from home to the ghetto pl ace.  
And for that -- the only thing when you had a sewing machine or another -- toaster, 

helped to trade it in by the gentiles.  Items lik
e that, they used to grab it and give you a 

good price, and they had money to buy it.  I 
had from one of my competitors when I 
wandered out of one of the buildings it was,
 a cigarette box mi xed from gold.  Asked me  
to trade it in for food.  It was from M r .`Frumpki
n (ph).  And I'll take it.  I'll try to do it, 
but I took it but I wasn't  capable to make a de
al and I brought it back. 
 He didn't -- if they 
would have caught, they would have caught me , 
not him.  It's  not interested.  It's not 
involved in it.  I was the one 
involved by tooking the transact
ion.  My life was in danger, 
but not theirs.  And --  
 

Q: We ll, but now, isn't it possible that if you wo
rked outside the ghetto you had more of an 
opportunity to do business or to get ex
tra food or that kind of thing?   
 

A:Yes.  They right, they live.  
But I don't know that life is worth it so much to do it.  Well, 
mostly Edna she was mo re for that.  I didn't go fo
r that.  Didn't want to risk    her life.  I 
had been looking for her twice.  And now 
when I run away from the ghetto, I run no 
more from the ghetto, but I had a new working 
place already.  They gave me rifemeister 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
46 
 
(ph).  What I really been doing, taki ng old 
guns, rifles, cleaning it, fixing it up, oiling it, 
and putting back in stock.  
 

Q:Is that outside or inside the ghetto?  

 

A:That was inside.  They took a few people.  Th
ey didn't took anybody.  They were afraid.  For 
me  they weren't afraid.  They say when I'd say it wouldn't happen, it wouldn't do -- I 

wouldn't done it.  
 

Q:Could -- how did people get chosen
 for certain job assignments?   
 

A:How did they get what?    

 

Q:How did people get chosen fo
r certain job assignme nts?   

 

A:Had to have pull.  You know wha t  pull, what 
I mean?   "P," protecti
on.  Without protection you 
didn't get nothing.  It just even don't dream a
bout it.  To get it, you wouldn't.  But it was 

Avraham Tory.  You had to have him when you 
need to get a good job.  It was Dr.`Geslin 
(ph), you had to have him to get a good job.  He was the labor departme nt chief.  He 

couldn't get without him a good job.  I couldn'
t get a good job.  I didn't get it.  My 
brother-in-law was a no-good.  It was every little thing he wants to be paid with mone y.  I 

wasn't  for that.  But I didn't  spoke to him again, a
nd           .  People had to have him to 
get -- to be able to get a job.   
 

Q:So the admi nistration 
in the ghetto was --  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
47 
 
A: Wa sn't  too hot.  Wa sn't  too hot.  The reputatio
n of theirs and the name  was terrible.  They 
were drunks.  They used to go out five, si
x, big shots -- I wouldn'
t call them -- going out 
in the city, encounters, looking arou
nd to get some thing for nothing.   
 
Q:They weren't that helpful to the population?   

 

A:No, no.  Nothing.  They weren't helpful.  They would help -- trying to help themself.  But in 
the end, the Germans killed them.  
 

Q: What about Tory?   Was he -- was 
he helpful?   Was he a good ma n?   
 

A:I don't know.  I cannot tell you.  I don't want to th
at he should get angry and ma ybe  some ti me s 
he run into me  and say, "What you done to me
? "   Well, I don't get along with him.  He 
right here, because I met him a couple of times in Israel.  I've been many times there.  

And I've been meeting him -- and, well, I don't know.   
Q:They were all a little bit --   

 

A:Yeah.  He didn't done any harm to me , but the book of his he been writing, it had all of it been 
translated, because he wa s a smart cookie. You know, I'd sa y one thing.  Well, it's not the 

Lithuanians.  You didn't know
 that Professor Belodski 
(ph) -- you heard of him?   
Professor Belodski was a professor of the Univ
ersity of Lithuania, 
a pr ofessor for civil 
law.  Professor Belodski -- Tory worked fo
r him,  a secretary.  And Professor Belodski 
lost his mi nd in ghetto, and they put him in a little home, locked him up, and left him.  

And he looked like a little dog would be locked 
up.  And I pass by and I seen it.  I pass by 
in the ghetto in that  corner, that  mo ment I was 
-- it was terrible.  And I told Tory.  I say, 
"Couldn't you be -- so big shots, couldn't you help that ma n? "  He could help.  "Why 

don't you do?   Why haven't you done it? "   He 
didn't  say nothing.  When you need him, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
48 
 
you need him, and            .  But he he
lped some  of them, too.  Without his help, what 
would good would he be?   But why would he ha
d to protect the Soviets or blue-mortgage 
(ph) or all those people wit
hout having benefit of mi nd to. 
 He had a second wife.  His 
first wife, he was ma rried to a girl whom he
 knew a lot of.  The boys from high school, in 
the fraternities, that I was along with them.  
We  mi ngled together; we knew each othe r.  
But some of them was nice and some of them 
wa s bad.  Some  of them pai d for it after the 
liberation.  
 
Q: What about Dr.`Elkes?   Wa s he a good ma n?   

 

A:Yeah.  Oh, a terrific ma n.  He already wr
ite a book.  You didn't 
read it, did you?    
 

Q: We ll, tell me  about him.   

 

A: We ll, I don't know.  He wrote a letter, Dr.`El kes,
 to his children.  He got a boy and a girl.  And 
he told them the direction of
 life, how they should behave
, how they should live.  In 
Tory's  book is it, and it breaks your heart.  
And one paragraph is worth -- oh, what he had 
it in that book.  But I'll have to get my 
book.  I got him in English.  In Hebrew he 
translated, because Israel couldn't use a book.  
It wasn't  good for him.  And I'll have to 
find out from my cousin.  
 

Q:But he was a good ma n?   

 

A:Yeah, he was a good ma n.  He wa sn't  --  

 

Q:And he tried to help the people?

A:He tried -- he could help more
, but he helped.  And I told him that, too.  I say -- we me t one 
time and we talk.  He helped.  He didn't 
done nothing wrong.  He could do ma ybe mo re, 
but he done as much as he could with wh
at's the name , with Gestapo ma n Miller.  
 
Q:Let's change.  We  need to change the tape.

Q:You were talking about the f
act that the Jewish governme nt, 
the police, the Judenrat (ph), 
really weren't that helpful.   
 

A:No.  

 

Q: Why -- why do you think it is that they seem to ha
ve a better reputation than in most ghettos?  
 

A:Because the people around those ghettos, and the people around the ages from the ghettos was 
me ntioned, they tried to help.  Here 
was Robovski (ph).  Robovski was a young, good 

Jew, who worked at the gate all day long fo
r three years.  And he done so much good by 
helping poor people get through -- he knew lik
e a sewing ma c hine going out.  In going 
out I saw him, I seen him from the ghetto to
 sell it some  bread, butter.  Robovski knew 
about it because the me n who got to take it out 
used to talk to Robovs
ki to see -- to get it 
German to tumult (ph) you know, that he s
hould know what he's  doing, take him awa y on 

the side at that mo ment that we were seen. 
 I carried one sewing machine, and it is a job 
to get it out.  I think Edna or else some body sol d
 it, a machine, and I had to carry it out.  
It was my height, and we  put it on the front le
gs right in here and 
the rear legs in the 
back, and you walk with a sewing ma chine.  We ll, but there you had to have help.  On 

some ti me s a person like that get caught, a
nd then he's in trouble and some body got to 
help him to get him out.  But some of them 
got feeling and some of
 the m not.  Some  of 
them say, "Oh, he got it for money."  He not 
got it for money; got it for food, for hunger.  
It all depend on the person, t
oo.  I don't know.  That's  why 
I build myself up a reputation 
in the beginning.  They begged me  I should jo
in the police.  I say, "Not me.  I would 
never do it.  I can't  do it.  How can I be a 
policeman when I with
 the boy who was from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
51 
 
Vensico (ph)" -- Robovski -- "been going to sc
hool, been to Hayda together.  How could 
I see that he's getting harmed and I stand 
by and not doing nothing.  Huh-uh.  That's  not -- 
wrong ma n."  I didn't.   
 
Q:How did people get food in the ghetto?    

 

A:Oh, this is no -- there was plenty.  It was st
ole.  It was one of my
 cousin, probably around 19, 
oh, you order to him a cow, he bring you a cow.
  You order to him flowers or anything 
you want.  You could get anything.  The best 
liquor you could get.  People had money to 
buy cognac.  They buy and drinking cognac.  And 
here is people working to death to get 
it going, and they having a good time.  But   
         controlled that stuff.  
 

Q:In the ghetto?  

 

A:In the ghetto.  

 

Q:But the Germans didn't know about this?  

 

A:No, huh-uh.  That was Atakata Pramovich (ph), fa m
ous lawyer.  And he got with -- he became  
one of the -- got in oven.   
 

Q:Now wha t  about the people who didn't have 
the money to buy the f
ood or the liquor?   
 

A:They had to eat kraut, cabbage with horse meat
.  You see, horse meat you had plenty.  That's 
what the Germans been sending to the Jews, 
horse meat and cabbage.  That's all they 

been getting.  They didn't -- nobody coul
d help, and they had no choice.   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
52 
 
Q:But your sense is people didn't go hungry?   
 

A:No, they didn't go hungry, because it's not the L
ithuanian's element on the job.  It's not the 
element like the Lithua nian Jews.  It is a 
person entirely another, ma de from another 
dough.  Right.  Even right now, you take -- when you go in any business, you go with the 

Lithuanian Jew, you have no worry.  It's  perf
ect.  But you go with the Polish Jew, he in 
troubles, because it's a element of the i rs is 
different.  Before they
 started, I could cheat 
you.   
 

Q: What else was going on in the ghetto?   Wa s ther
e any semblance of a norma l life?   Were there 
activities?   Were there schools?   
 

A:Yeah, there was activities, for sure.  There 
was a schools.  There wa
s a Zionist organization 
working.  There was the communist organization 
working in the ghetto.  It was all kind of 
activities working.  But --  
 

Q:Did you get involved in any of that?   

 

A:Not, no, huh-uh.   

 

Q: What about culture?   

 

A:Some , not much.  Yeah, it was after the liberation I 
got involved; but       mi gration, this I was 
very much involved.  
 

Q:But that's later.  In the period of th
e ghetto, were there cultur al activities?   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
53 
 
A:Yes.  
 

Q: We re people dating?   
Were people getting ma rried?   Wa s there --  
 

A:No, no.  This is all stopped.  I don't know, ma ybe
 in other ghettos.  Maybe some  other ghetto, 
but in Kovno ghetto  nothing, no mo re.  Only was the partisans worked hard, worked 

good, and they wouldn't killed Hyme  Yearling (p
h).  You heard about Hyme  Yearling?    
Q:A little.   

 

A:A little.  And they wouldn't kill hi m in the ghett
o, what survive.  And I'm a personal fr iend to 
his brother, May Yearling.  He
's  now in -- Yearling is in Israel.  And I went with May 
Yearling in high school.  We  gr
aduated the same  year.  A
nd I knew Hyme  Yearling, too.  
Then I didn't knew that Hyme  Yearling was so 
capable and so brave.  He killed hims elf 
with a razor blade.  He run 
out of ammunition.  He couldn't 
fight.  Took a razor blade, cut 
his veins.  And Kovno there is a place Cochen 
(ph).  Cochen's a building, and there was a 
fight going on in that building.  
 

Q: We ll, what else can you tell me  about the ghe
tto life?   Did you continue to celebrate Jewish 
holidays?  Was there any --  
 

A:No.  You know, you going out from ghetto.  Here 
I went out from ghet t o with what?   With 
nothing.  I lost a mother, a father, tw
o sisters.  It was         
   me .  And I was thinking, here 
I had an opportunity.  Maybe I had the opportuni
ty to save them, and people cheated me  
of my fa mily, and I don't think I can never 
forget.  I didn't know -- I didn't know -- I got 
now a woma n who what is my cousin's  wi
fe who lives in Florida, and she's got 
everythi ng she wanted, but she took away my sist
er's place.  And I tell her it straight in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
54 
 
her face.  I say, "If not you, my sister woul
d be alive."  Or ma ybe not.  Maybe not, but 
right the way it stays, I didn'
t have no choice.  Well --  
 
Q:Is there anything else you can tell me  
about the daily life in the ghetto?   
 

A: We ll, I don't know the -- there was some thing, the music, you know, the Gestapo, the Himmler 
group, they liked music.  And the Kovno ghetto 
had musicians in the ghetto, the stupors 
(ph), and the windmill (ph).  And all the musi
cians they had to once a week come in the 
building from the semi nary -- Was a larg
e building.  That bui
lding hold about 1500 
people -- and play music for the ghetto people. 
 It's  the way they got it in their head.  
They had to go.  Who the heck was thinking with music?   But they had to go.  They 

forced you to go.   
 

Q:Did ORT (ph) go in
to the ghetto?   
 

A:ORT, no.  

 

Q:ORT?   

 

A:ORT Gar denia (ph).  ORT orga
nized the regstaten (ph).  ORT 
put in all of the -- Yakovaleski 
(ph) was the ma n.  Yakovaleski was the one 
who organized it.  Yakovaleski is the one 
who created ORT.  Yakovaleski,
 he was -- he came  here and he survived.  He came here 
after the war.  And he died in -- in Te l Aviv, and cal
led a part of the cemetery in           .  
And a lot of them still have an occupation 
now and working now with trade with kept 
(ph) ma king.  That was a big deal.  And poor 
Leski.  He trained them with kids.  He 
learned them.  He ma de  me  as a ORT me mb
er.  He came aft e r the war to Edna.  The 
ORT girls, ORT woma n.  They invited him to 
come to speak from Israel.  And he come 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
55 
 
here, and he spoke.  And he knew Edna from
 the ghetto time and before the ghetto.  And 
he likes her cooking.  Yakovaleski is a country
 (ph) within.  He's  dead.  Nice ma n.  
Lovely man.   
 
Q:How muc h information at the time did you ha
ve about what was going on with the wa r and 
what was going on with the concentration camps?   
 

A:I knew everything what it was on 
the radio.  I used to jump out at night when I worked the 
night brigade, or even in day
time.  I worked -- the brigade was rifemeister, they'r e called.  
And there was a group of around 30 people w
ith two woma n.  The woma n used to 
prepare a kitchen for us to eat.  The capt
ain was a nice ma n.  He was a vermacht (ph) 
person from the army, and he was in charge of
 our group of the rifeme istery.  And he see 
to it that we should be fed right, we shoul
d be treated right.  He was a nice ma n.  
Something he was from the German s oldier, not 
bad.  And he used to go to eat in the city.  
Slobodka is a suburb, but to go to have a good meal for the Ge stapo was they got to go to 

his headquarters to --  
 

Q:Kovno.   

 

A:To Kovno.  And the captain used to go away 
for two hours, and there'd be no way to figure 
and no one knew how long he was gone and all that
.  And I used to go in in the office and 
the captain turn on the shortwave radio.  Ev
erybody watching me , what's  on the news.  
Everything I knew what's was 
going on.  To England, mostly. 
 The piece of Canterbury is 
there a big religious ma n.  He been appealing to
 the Pope, and we asking the Pope to help 
the Jews, they killing all the Jews.  And th
e Pope didn't care.  He didn't -- now John is 

different, because he is more a
ssociated with the Polish Jews .  It was his friends.  But the 
other one, well --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
56 
 
 
Q:Let me -- well, let's stop for a mi nute.  Let's 
just try to finish up on 
this ghetto chapter --  
 

A:Uh-huh.  

 

Q:-- and sort of how you felt day to
 day while you were living in the ghetto.  You went to work.  
Your fa mily all went in differe
nt directions in the daytime.
  Was there a fear during the 
day that you mi ght be hurt 
or that when you came  home  from work somet hing mi ght be 
wrong with your fa mily?   
 

A:Right.  Oh, this was all the time.  We were 
afraid ma ybe one of the family wouldn't  come  
back.  And go in the morning to work, we didn't know you'll be back.  Maybe not.  

Maybe you'll be reported by somebody.  Maybe so mebody will be hot and go to the 

Gestapo and say, "Hey, take a look.  He me
ssed it up."  It's good -- it's enough to get 
killed -- he re           .  Every day Hi
tler used to send burgess (
ph) with all metal pieces, 
filling it up, bringing in ceme nt for they need 
it for the airpor t for the runways.  And 
taking our back steel -- old 
cars, old tanks, all that, bri
nging it back.  And who had to 

unload?   Me, as they elected.  I was a mech
anic and top quality mechanic already, they 
send me  there to help unload the cement and he
lp to load up the stee
l.  And it was a tough 
job, because it was raining and I didn't  have any 
shoes.  I had a cut-up tire, with a knife  to 
cut it up on, and tied it up around with wires 
that I shouldn't slip.  And here I'm going 
with a me tal on my shoulder and bring it in to th
e bars to drop it in th
at it should be filled 
up.  I don't know how many tongues they had to
 have.  And when I'm going with the 
wornout tires sole, I slipped.  
And when I slipped, and I had 
still a piece of metal on my 
shoulder, I dropped the metal and I start fall
ing.  And I grab myself on the wood and the 
board, but it was going like a litt
le bridge from top down to th
is piece of me tal.  And I 
pulled myself up not to fall in.  Woul d I fa
ll in, I don't know how I would got out.  Maybe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
57 
 
I would be dead, because of this old br oken 
up steel for the rest of the other boys been 
dropping it in.  And the Germans se en it.  
He come  running to me , without even saying 
nothing, and start beating me  with a stick.  Ri
ght here on my shoulder.  And I -- I couldn't 
forget.  I told the German, "You shut up.  Y
ou better stop.  I'll break your neck."  And I 
knew the German will react right away.  I am 
a nothing.  I am a dog in that time.  And he 
pulled out a pistol and start laying into me
.  And the boys who knows me , I walked with 
me together in the same spot, told me, 
"Ipson, run, run.  He going to kill you.  Take a 
look.  He's got to pull the gun.  You better 
go."  And all of a sudden I hear shimm, 
shimm, shimm, shi mm.  And also I been 
saved.  I don't know how I got saved.  I been 
running right behind the old cars,
 the old trucks, and he lost
 his aim right.  But in the 
beginning he as going to kill me in a mi nute.  
And here is a case here I went to work, I 

wouldn't even dreamed about it was going to 
happen, and get killed.  It's  what's  
happening in the life every day, every hour, every mi nute.  
 

Q:Did you teach your son -- he was a -- was your daught
er still alive at this point?   Your little 
girl, was she still with you?   
 

A:Yeah.  No, she wasn't  there.  She was dead already.  

 

Q:Before -- how did she die?   

 

A: We  didn't  -- she died from poison, poisoned milk. 
 That's  what the doctor said.  The doctor.  
Who knows ?   Edna says she needs for the girl milk.  She was young; she was three 

months.  And I went to the farmer asking fo
r milk, and she gave me  the milk.  And s he 
told me to be careful.  She say, "The milk is
 ma ybe sour," but she didn't -- she didn't want 
I -- to spill out.  She want to give some 
of the Jews a piece and buy one to drink for the 
child.  And that way I got her the m
ilk, and she died a month later.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
58 
 
 
Q:This was at the very beginning of the ghetto?  

 

A:Right.  Very beginning.  It was after the pogro
ms.  I went to the numbe r two highway, not the 
number one.  The numbe r one highway a lot of Jews been comi ng back and they been -- 

got stopped and killed.  They be
 killed by the Lithuanians.  
 

Q:So was your daughter, did she go into the 
ghetto with you or this was all before?   
 

A:Before.  

 

Q:Okay.  So you had your son.  Did you teach him how
 to protect hi ms elf in the ghetto?   How to 
hide or anything?   
 

A:Right.  We had to.  

 

Q: What did you teach him?   

 

A:I would teach him to be quiet, not to say a wo
rd, nothing.  When he's  i n the dark, be careful, 
look around every step,            the good 
light.  And he should be
 careful to move around 
from one ghetto to small ghetto.  Wh en we are escaped, why I had to have him a place 

where to keep him.  Gentiles wouldn't ta
ke him, and I didn't want nobody should know 
too much about it.  And I had to take him 
over fr om the big ghetto to the small one.  
Where I took him over to the small ghetto and to
ld him, I said be quiet.  He shouldn't say 
a word until -- wait until we come  back and we'
ll bring him.  And here is a kid like five 
months -- no, no, not five months
.  Five -- five weeks.   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
59 
 
Q:Five years.   
 

A:Right.  No, I been laying -- he was laying, not 
move.  And he had a German soldier, guard, 
and going around with his boot.  And he was close to him, and he say, "Oh," and I train 

him.  
 

Q:It must have been difficult to have 
a such a young child at that time .   
 

A:I didn't have no choice.  When you have no 
choice, you be surprised at what you do.  You do 
anything when some thing bad is chasing you, 
pushing you, and telling 
you what to do.  
You don't become  no more that all-quie
t person, don't say nothing and do nothing and 
interested in nothing.  You can't  do it.  It's
 another force forces you to do things which 
you never thought done it in your normal life.  
 

Q:But did you ever think of trying to get him to 
safety or to ma ybe to stay with some  of the 
Lithuanian people without you so that 
you could move about more freely?   
 

A:No.  I didn't trust the Lithua
nians.  Nothing.  The Lithuani
ans was this worser than the 
Germans.  The Germans, when you speak a 
good German, you still could save yourself, 
but not with the Lithuanians.  Like I came in
 Berlin, I run from the Russians.  I run from 
them, too.  I run from the  Germans.  I  run from 
the Russians.  I got to 
run -- keep running.  
I come  in Berlin and --  
 

Q:This is --  let's wait for that; okay?   

 

A:Okay.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
60 
 
Q:I don't mean to stop you, but I know that come s later.   
 

A:All right.  

 

Q: We re you aware of any underground or re
sistance activity inside the ghetto?   

 

A:Oh, yeah.  

 

Q:How did you know about it?  

 

A:I know May Yearling, boyfriend of
 mi ne, and he used to come  once in a while, get together, 
he and his wi fe, and we been talking.  
And his brother was Hy me , Hyme  Yearling, and 
Hyme  Yearling was tough.  But I want now-- well, I don't know.  One case I don't know.  

I can't  tell you.  I don't know who sue some , a
nd I don't want to get Meyer (ph) involved.  
Meyer a good boy.  
 

Q: We ll, did you ever think of getting involved with them?   

 

A:Oh, no, no.  I send him every once in a while a check
  to help him.  He  sends me  -- he writes a 
book.  He sends me  a book; I send him a check.  He knows I got already fixed customer.  

And he writes about the ghetto.  It's  
all he writes about, the ghetto life.  
 

Q:No, no, I'm talking about then.  At the time  --   

 

A:No.  

 

Q:-- did you know what was goi
ng on with the underground?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
61 
 
 
A:No.  I didn't want to know.  I didn't want to 
get involved, because they had problems with the 
underground by the gate.  The shootout was 
between the underground and Gestapo at the 
gate of Florence (ph).  Florence was a soap
 factory, and there was a corner covered by 

Hol mes Higher Buildings (ph).  It was a hi
ding place ther e.  And there they went out 
from the ghetto.  It was going already to the underground group to the woods.  They been 

already             and checked it, and it
 was right by the factory of Florence.  The truck 
driver who had been taking them ove r took money from nothing, and he spilled the 

beans.  He told the Gestapo that the group Je
ws are running out from
 the  ghetto, and they 
been waiting already for them and they star
t shooting each other.  We ll, and everybody 
survived, but they killed the so
fa (ph) and got rid of the truc
k.  But that ma n is buried in 
the cemetery from Richmond.  He c a me  to me  a
nd I helped him.  And he decide to settle 
with what they done, with the lights laid 
out, and they caught th
em with their handgun by 
the gate and Lipzer took him out.  
 

Q:So toward the end of your stay in the ghetto, 
you had heard about children being taken away.  
You decided you had to get out, and that's
 when you contacted your wife's uncle?   
 

A:Right.  

 

Q:Now, at that point, who was still livi
ng with you before you 
left the ghetto?   
 

A:My father and mother and sisters.  I had a br
ot he r - i n- la w, who I  wi s h  
I would never had had.  
He -- my sister was his wife, and he lost her.  
But he's been a big shot.  He was a tough.      
-fuhrer, they call it.  And he was living with
 -- in ghetto, and he was thinking he's bigger 
than anybody.  And, you know, because of him I lost my sister, and --  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
62 
 
Q:And your wife's  fa mily?   
 

A:No.  She lost everybody -- in five mi nutes, she 
lost them.  They come  and ask for Riga, who 
was the I -- the selection for Riga.  Riga, 
Jews for Rigaburg (ph).  The reason was the 
Germans weren't careful, and they st or ed all th
e Jews in Riga.  Killed them all.  Didn't 
have any work force where they could get th
em for nothing.  And then they had to get 
people for -- new people for Riga.  They took it
 from the ghetto of Kaunas and send it to 
Riga, and there went my wife's  fa
mily.  There went her family.  
 

Q:But they -- when they took your wife
's fa mily, how did that come  about?   
 

A:Oh, it            for one right now.  They tr
uck away my father-in-law,
 Edna's  stepfather, great 
big hand.  He must see me staying for the last 
time  that he waved, and I stayed in front of 
my eyes all the time.  They appears by his hous
e, as he was a very, 
nice, nice, nice ma n.  
But he went to the ghetto from the first da
y to the last.  And 
the police came -- I don't 
know.  Maybe it's my fa ult, too.  I don't know. 
 They need five people -- they need people 

for Riga to come  and get them.  There were
 five.  It was a father and mother, two 
brothers, and a sister.  It was five people. 
 They come  and ask for them.  But she be 
around -- I don't know where she was in that mo
ment -- she wouldn't let him take it.  And 
she wasn't  there, and she blame right now in fi
ve mi nutes I lost a family, and cries all, all 
the time .  Be cause it was very, very painful fo
r her.  And I still had my fa mily, but I lost 
them in the big selection.  And that's quite 
in the big election.  No, no, it was bad.  There 
was a brigade was Monkas Melina (ph).  M
onk.  And that ma n had build himself a place 

to hide that it was unbelieva
ble.  You couldn't find it anyw
ay you want to look.  And he 
was in the ghetto.  And my sister was with 
him in his me lina.  And when they tried -- 
after the war, I run right away I was there.
  August the 1st the communists took Kaunas.  
I was the first -- in the evening, I was there. 
 And I came with the trucks from the Russian 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
63 
 
soldiers, find the Jews already, jump ed with
 them in the truck, and came to Kaunas and 
run right away through the ghetto.  And I runni
ng into the ghetto and going from cor ner 
to corner at the bottom looking.  Nothing.  It
 was so clean, and I never seen like it.  I 
couldn't find nothing.  The only thing I seen Li
thuanians, which was in Pavoretto (ph) 
what were the pieces of a woma n.  Lithuanian
 woman with a long stick with a big metal 
digging in the ground, trying to find some body b
odies, ma ybe.  She could find others, be 
able to get some  stuff.  I t  was unbelievable.
  And there the gentile who had lived next 
door th cemetery seen me.  I used to go a
nd listen to the shortwave radio, what's  going 
on.  And he told me  he seen that there is
 too that there was Segersom (ph).  No 
Mendleson (ph).  Mendleson was a ma n who wa s 
in the br igada with me, and in a year 
after the war, and he run in in
 the place where we been working.  He work with me  there 
in the brigade.  And hiding himself, Mendleson. 
 And one of our soldiers, this -- and the 
German ar my was going back already all the wa
y back to Tulsic (ph).  And one of the 
head like a Gestapo decided to go in there wh
ere it was working, the sergeant, and what's  
his name  wa sn't  too careful, and he seen Mendl
eson.  He took his pistol and killed him in 
the day of the liberation.  And 
it was they killed Mendleson.  
 

Q:Okay.  Why don't you tell me  a little bit a
bout how you left the ghett
o.  How you and Jay and 
Edna left the ghetto to go into hiding.  
You told me that you had ma de arrangeme nts 
through her uncle.  Would you 
prefer to stop now?   
 

A:It's -- I would stop, yeah.  

 

Q:Okay.  Why don't we do that.   

 

A:Okay?    

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
64 
 
Q:Okay.  So how is it that you got ou
t of the ghetto to 
go into hiding?   
 
A: We ll, after we got 
out of the ghetto --  
 

Q:How did you get out?  

 

A: We ll, how I got out to the ghetto, as I had to get 
at night to -- I cut the ba
rbed wire with a pair 
of pliers, opened up a big hole, and crawled 
through that hole.  Across the street  was 
ma ybe by 200 feet was already houses.  It
 was a small ghetto who was -- that was 
liquidated.  That is their houses where they li
ved, the people.  And from t here already a 
far mer, my uncle send to us, was waiting outs
ide of the territory was a hundred and -- 
close to a hundred miles.  And there we got 
together again there.  Jay, me , and Edna and 
the farmer.  And he put in Jay in the wagon, 
which was full of straw, covered him up, so 
it shouldn't be nobody should see him.  And I 
was walking with that wagon, because to 
the danger pl aces I didn't want to run and to 
ma ke some  noises, should be as quiet as 

could be.  I even asked the farmer to take 
the shoe of the horse, to put the shoe with 

rubber pads we shouldn't hear him go around or 
do anything, we be quiet.  The same  is 
what's  very important for us, the German, they had these boots there with nails.  You 

could hear it for a mile.  And that's the 
way we moved.  I seen one stopped us with a 
wagon, " Where are you going?   Wha t  you got? "   Th
ey got -- they thinking he the farmer.  
"You got anything for sale? "   "I don't have a
nything for sale," and they didn't bother.  
 

Q:And your wife was wa lking, also?   

 

A:She was walking as much as she can.  We  all 
walked -- wa lk as much as we can.  We had a 
wagon to take us in and go as fast and all we
 want, but we didn't  walk that way.  You 
were so scared every little noise.  A rabbit 
goes by, you jump, scared to death.  Who is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
65 
 
that with that noise?  And then we were successful.  Thank God.  My cousin when he 
went to me , he went on a bicycle. 
 It was a long, long worn out trip.  
 

Q:How far did you have to travel?   

 

A:60 -- about 75 miles.  

 

Q:So now, did you go with this one farmer the whole time ?   

 

A:That farmer, the younger, he's  brave, smart.  He
 didn't fit in for a farmer.  When I could bring 
him here, I would have done anything for him, 
as good as he is.  And they work, as I say, 
everything fit together.  I 
tell you, not like a farmer, but 
like a professor, you know, 
everything right.  He told us ahead of time -- 
when we came in the ghetto -- I mean out of 
the ghetto, he brought us in in his house, and 
he didn't hear nothing.  The poor farmer, his 
house was a smokehouse  -- what they call?  A 
smokehouse.  Like the smoking ham or it's 
-- he had the oven without the chimney.  And 
he get two little boys, very noisy, and for 
the boys are more worried -- scared more for 
them than I was scared for the big ones.  
But first place he told the 
boys they should put us on the top of the oven.  The oven is 
almost as big as half of that room, and it 
was nice and warm a nd comfortable, because it 

was cold, ice and snow, and he put us right und
er there.  And we were asleep, and it was 
enjoyable sleep I ever had.  But here come s 
in the farmer, and he start snooping.  And he 
say, "Wait a mi nute.  Who is here?"  He aske
d the children if he knew whom to ask.  The 
children they would tell him.  The rest, we
 wouldn't tell him.  "Who lives here?   Who 
moved in here recently," he asked the kids a
nd asked the farmer 's wife.  They say -- his 
wife ask him, " Why are you asking?  What doe
s that have to do with your business?"  
"No, here is city folks moved in.  I smell. 
 The smell is a city smell.  And somebody, 
stranger, mo ved in.  Wh o could move in? "   He
 started figuring the 
people telling to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
66 
 
room and whom you think could be?  "It must be
 city lawyer.  That's  all.  The lawyer 
come  here."  And it was me .  You see, "The 
lawyer with It ska (ph)
", Itska was her uncle, 
"they are the one moved up right here.  They 
in that house," he tells the woma n.  We ll, 
she send the kids right away to come  home , his   
        .  And he came, and she told them 
both the ma n's na me  or was here and what he 
said.  He said, "We in trouble.  We got to 
get out immediately," the farmer 
said, "for mi ne house.  And let's take them to his sister's 
home ."  And that's  what we did.  And we
 going halfway, the sister, the bugs, the dogs 
start barking, carrying on.  He says, "It's 
no good.  The farmer  was going with us to the 
people we were going.  He told Edna, "We 'll 
have to go to the Paskavitz (ph), to the 
people Paskavitzes."  And they the only one in 
this situation they could help -- can help 

us, because the Gestapo wouldn't bother with th
em because their son- in-law the chief of 
police of Volitus (ph), a city.  A small city, 
not a big one.  And they -- and he's very 
tough, tough chief of police.  And then they
 have to worry when people are find out, 
they'll go everywhere until hi s house, until -- to 
that chief they don't want to start it.  
Well, everyone in this time was not kosher.
  Everybody will be taking it to the tabl e, 
taking           , steali
ng, covering, all kind of mi smatchof business was going on.  But up 
to the chief of police.  And then the fa rmer
 told Edna, "When you can go in in the house 

and tell the old lady who you are, then they'll do it.  She'll do for you because of your 

mother."  And her mother was already dead.  
Then he told the boys to watch out, not to 
go home , never go with him.  The farmer
 took him around and let the boys go on around 
because it would ma ybe be caught and can be me ssed up.  He was smart.  And then every 

5 -- every 10 mi nutes, the farmer used to la
y down on the ground with
 the ears, and knew 
the move me nt from the Gestapo.  The Gest
apo was already looking 
for us.  And when 
they -- they knew exactly where the Gesta
po were, because the noise, the walk, when 
they been wa lking.  It wa s wintertime and co
ld, and the snow was ice, and we go with 
boots on ice it's ma kes a noise which you can h
ear far away.  And every half hour we 
used to lay down.  We  go into woods, and they say "Let's  go.  It's  good.  The dogs are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
67 
 
there," and they be giving us the plans on m
oving with us where the dogs are.  The dogs 
were making the noise because the new strange people came in.  They think the strange 
people they were after them
.  And it was not one, it was a bunch of police looking, 
because I was the dangerous one.  Dangerous 
than the partisans, because partisans was 
living right there too in those woods
, in the woods.  It was thick woods and good           , 
and it what the partisans need.  They live in 
there.  And it's the way we mo ved up to the 
Paskavitzes.  Edna knocks in the window, and "Who's  there?"  And Edna say -- 

mentioned her mother's name.  "Don't  know her."  The old ma n comes up to the door, 

opens it a crack, and say, "Who you? "  And she tells him she is Esther's -- Esther's 

daughter, and she want to talk with him. 
 "Esther's daughter?  Which Esther are you 
talking about? "  Say "Esther from Slobodka, fr
om Lithuania, that is my mother.  And I 
am Hikki (ph)," they call it, 
yeah, "I am Hikki's daughter." "Oh, Hikki's daughter."  They 
know who it is.  They let us in home, she 
and her husband.  Her son, second son died.  

They had a daughter and a son.  The son did no
t investigated what goes on in the village, 
because they knew each other.  Every moveme nt
.  Anything in a little village they knew.  
Then he went out that night to report the 
mother and father what's happening in the 
village.  And they come  back the next da
y and reported that the 
Gestapo was looking for 
-- spent two hours check
ing, searching around the lake, a
lthough they had a round lake, 
and couldn't find them.  Couldn't find nobody.  A
nd they dissolve it.  They decided to 
move in another time.  They didn't         
  .  Two days they come  again.  And this time , 
they were very close to us, closer here, but
 there was not time even to get if you were 
laying right in the attic, laying 
the cover it up with all junk, w
ith all hay and all that.  But 
we -- he didn't  even let us stay there no more.  The 
farmer 's brother-in-law took us            
from the attic.  Edna and me  and Jay, all three,
 out.  He don't want even to have us close 
by.  He's  afr a id that when we get caught, he'
ll be shot by the Gestapo.  And they let out 
rumors mor e  and more they were killing.  
It was true.  They been -- the Ge rmans around 
there caught a lot of undergr
ound people in those woods.  An
d the only thing -- the only 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
68 
 
salvation people had, the German
s were scared to death for the woods.  For woods they 
were afraid, because they know with the 
underground is no pl ace to play.  They when 
they do a job, they do it.  They blew up five trai
n loads with soldiers ri ght in this section.  
It was a very worthwhile section for the underground, that even Moscow had been 
sending the partisans by plane in
 those sections.  Well, and 
when we came to them, we 
could stay only three weeks and we had to m
ove  out again.  Had it rough.  That movi ng is 
terrible.  Wh y we had to move?   It was righ
t before Christma s, and before Christma s all 
the families had got together for the holidays,
 and the people were layi ng there in a big 
bottom covered up in straw and hay, and we were 
afraid that the kids, that two small kids 
were came also, that they'll start getting noisy, and going up in the            in daytime, they 
can find us.  Then Paskefski -- Paskofski, I 
got ahold of Edna's uncle, and told him, I 
said, "Take us out of there.  He's afraid to 
keep us."  Because we could been -- all could 

get in dangers.  We  had to move out agai
n from this place and go looking for another 
place.  The only place we decide -- which I 
decided with Edna's  uncle, it would be -- 
there was Paskavitzes was the first one, but th
is  was Paskofski.  This was two separate 
fa milies.  Another one, Paskofski.  Paskofski was a very, very, very poor farmer, a very 

religious ma n.  Nice ma n.  And he done it anyt
hing for a reason.  He didn't took from me  
-- didn't even want to take from me.  I o
ffered him money.  I had a few gold pieces.  I 
say, "Take it to him only at least one for me mo
ry for me."  He took one.  We used to sit 
down outside  at night.  The only conversation wi
th each ot her.  At 1:00 o'clock at night, 
and talking about the things, what's going 
on, what's  happening in the world, with the 

fight, what with all the traveling, with the pr
edicting when can we be liberated.  Here we 
already have the war in St alingrad.  In St
alingrad with the Russians took the overhead, 
and they been already stopped.  The Germ
an ar my to go forward and start already 
pushing them back.  And I tell them the war.  
When we came then to Paskofski, we were 
a little happier.  Why poor -- and nobody was looking for a poor farmer.  Everybody -- 

the partisans came, they look for a partis
an with money.  A partisan with good -- buy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
69 
 
ammunition.  And where they would find the 
ammunition?   Right by the far mers.  The 
far mers used to sell the ammunition.  They us
ed to come in, and -- 
the partisans, and to 
the farmers, and have the name s and have
 everything they already knew also their 

investigation, through their i
nvestigation, what's happening.  But Paskofski had two 
potato peats.  And a potato -- you know what a 
potato peat?   Ninety 
percent of the people 
don't know, never heard of it, they don't know what
 it is.  But a potato peat, there we used 
to lay.  I was one cuple days in the barn sleepi
ng there.  I wasn't  safe.  I couldn't sleep.  I 
was scared all the time.  Maybe somebody's co
ming in.  And then I mostly staying right 

there.  And then Paskofski also have a Germ
an shepherd, a dog, smart like a -- called him 
Vilgas (ph).  I gave him a name  Vilgas.  V
ilgas means wol f.  And I been talking to him 
and eating together from one plate, bring 
him up and hand the bones, for the farmer had 
bones left over.  Why, s o me times I went out with him to get soliciting help, soliciting 

food from the farmers.  I used to go with 
Edna's  uncle.  He knew everybody.  He knew 
where to go in and where to stay away from; which house there was a friend, and if there 

was an enemy right there; to know where to go,
 to watch their step and not to go.  That's 
why we succeed, because Edna's uncle knew everything.  Every step we do he say, "Don't 

worry.  Come back."  We used to come  in
 the morning, he say, "You go and do your job."  
I say, "What's your job?   He say, "Ki
ll the lice."  I hate fo
r --             shower for months, 
and they were covered up with all this stuff. 
 But then the only thing early in the morning 
a little sign of sun, a fe w rays came in, we st
ay in there and clean 
it up ourself that we 
should be able to wear another day.  And but 
then -- and the rest of them, the uncle, all 

my cousins, we were 14 people in the two peat
s.  And how I done the peats, one of them 
were apart from the other, like from this wa
ll until here, it was a tunnel.  A tunnel that 
used to be able to go in and out.  To 
go to the tunnel, you had to -- on your belly, 
particularly for kids, you had to crawl up to the exit.  And it wasn't  such a easy job 

because we had five, three, five -- six kids, a
nd they been for them it was there to play.  
For Jay he was at that time five, he would 
crawl in there and crawl in he re, who was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
70 
 
crawling fast er.  But I was scared to death 
that it could collapse
.  I didn't have any 
support.  I put in a few branches, but that's 
all.  And I said the ground could -- the sand 
could fell and killed the kids.  And then I woul
d be in trouble; they 
would be all over us 
dead.  It was rough.  And Edna, when you say that Jay listen to me . 
 He had to listen.  
And I told them, every one of them, that I am
 the boss.  That they should know not play 
around, not to run around, because our lives depend on it.  Finally the kids, after they 
understood I was right, they already been c
ontrolling theirself.  When somebody been 
talking a little louder, the ot
her kids would say, "You shut up. 
 You keep quiet."  And at 
night we used to go out and get some  bread.  And then when in day, in daytime, well, the 

woma n got to go out after all, say person cannot
 be all the time, we have empty stoma c h.  
And then we had to a fix up for that, too.  A 
big bucket with all that
 outside and cover it 
up with potatoes, rotten, rotten potatoes.  I ma
de it that way that the rotten potatoes was 
high, and I'd been pulling with a string to 
opens it up a little openi
ng, and all the rotten 
potatoes fills up the hole that you couldn't s
ee the entrance  And people been comi ng.  
First thing, the dog used to take care of a lot 
of things.  Never did let nobody to come  in 
close by.  I've been training him so that I 
didn't give him the bones unless he go and fix it 
up, get himself a place -- I did a job.  I had some
 fun.  And it worked.  I've been talking to 
him like to a person, and he believes me .  A
nd I'm staying one evening, and I used to go 
out to fix the peats.  It wa s around 10:00 o'
clock at time and all the farmers are asleep, 
and I shouldn't  get in any troubles by stay
ing and digging.  I wasn't  careful enough, and it 
collapse on me.  The sand from the    peats 
got together in one spot and got wrapped to 
here in sand.  It was terrible.  I couldn't  
move.  The first time I understood what it means 
being covered up with sand that is unable to
 move away nothing.  I was staying in one 
spot.  I couldn't even move a hand.  Nothing. 
 I couldn't even breathe, getting harder and 
harder to breathe.  Vilgas was right with me . 
 And I told Vilgas, "I'm in troubles.  Go and 
bring me  Paskofski.  Go and bring me  Paskofski."  And I showed him a bone, and it 

cooked.  And he come  to get for a bone.  I took the bone.  "You go and bring him and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
71 
 
then I go give it to you."  I been talking to 
him like I talk to a person.  Anytime after I 
have a lesson with a dog, the dog takes off.  
Where he goes, I don't know.  I told him, I 
said, "Go to the old ma n," the owner, the farm
er.  I said, "Wa ke him up."  But he didn't.  
What's happened, the farmer had a son, Stasook (ph).  His name 's Stacese (ph).  That's he 
used to go -- every weekend go in the farm places, the music with ghettos, and go in there 

to dance and carry on.  And passing by every time , automa tically he used to pass by the 

peat.  See how the dog didn't bother him.  He knew hi m very well.  And the dog seen 

Stasook Stacese comi ng up, and he jumped right
 on him and start pushi
ng him.  His paw 
back, and should go front, and said go to the peat.  And Stacese understood some thing in 

trouble.  "Who's in trouble?   Tell me ," he
 asked the dog.  And the dog grabbed him fr om 
his coat, the coat, the side, and pulled me  up 
to the hole to the peats where I been laying, 
and he dug me  out.  And I could move.  I was a 
feeling like I got from 
dea d to alive.  It 
was a terrific.  And I got out.  Then he say, "Well, they'll ma ke a meal."  "Okay.  We  

make a meal .  I'll pay for it."  We got a pig, 
and we had to smoke some  for Jay.  He loved 

Jay, give him some thing to eat.  And that's th
e way we got out for a while.  Now, the war 

came to Vilnius, and Vilnius from the place where the army, the Russian army was 

around 75 miles.  And a week later, I seen th
e oldier.  The soldier going clear up without 
a           , with holes, with all that.  A
nd Paskofski tell me , he say, "It's a Russian solder.  
It's not a German.  A Ge rman wouldn't  go sloppy the way he's going."  I say, "Wait a 

mi nute."  I look a mi nute.  I say, "Yeah, it's a 
German -- I mean Russian."  I holler in the 
Russian language to him.  He responds and come up to me .  I ask him, "What you doing 

here?   The Germans wi ll kill you."  "No, th
ey wouldn't kill me ."  I say "What do you 
mean? "   He say, "My army some where around 
here.  They full now here around.  Don't 

worry.  Nothing going to happen to you, too."  
He knew right away.  I told him how I got 
up there, and I sounded potato pe
ats and all that stuff.  A
nd I say, "Now I got to find -- 
tell me , whe r e is your captain?   I want to ta
lk to a captain, to a
nybody."  He say, "Let me  
first find him."  I don't know about the Russian
 army.  They go fight with the Germans 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
72 
 
and they don't know one from each other.  Bu
t finally they come  up, and he was one of 
the Jewish captain.  And I told him who I am
, how I come  here, and what's is here, and 
who's Paskofki.  And to be sure, he asked me
 a certain prayer, a Jewish prayer.  I sa id, 
say, it's a song, it's -- the captain, 
Russian captain say, "I repeat 
it."  I say, "All right.  You 
okay.  Now I know you'r e  not the enemy.  I am 
not afraid for you.  You're not do me  a ny 
harm."  And he say, "Where are you going? "   
And I tell him I want to
 go -- the first thing 
to go to the ghetto to see ma ybe so
mebody from my fa mily is alive.  
 
Q:Can I stop you here?   

 

A:Uh-huh.  

 

Q:I want to ask you some more questions about 
this time you were in hiding before you go back 
to your ghetto.

and ma ke fl our out of it.  And then we put 
it right in the oven and make bread.  We  had 
plenty to eat.  It was no problem as 
long as we could go 
out and bring in.  
 

Q:And so you went out at night?  

 

A:At night.  

 

Q: Where was this oven?  You mean in the farmer's house?   

 

A:Yeah, farmer 's house.  

 

Q:So you had water and you had food and --   

 

A: We  had -- we had everything.  We  didn't -- 
about food was no problem.  It was no problem 
even in hiding, because -- but you got to be care
ful.  You couldn't be reckless.  I couldn't 
stay there.  The farmer was tired also not
 doing nothing.  I was ti
red not doing nothing.  
Then the farmer, I seen here now the same  th
ing, got two long sticks.  And I got one, he 
got one, and we work hand in hand.  It 
was very, very, inte
resting, and it's a good 
exercise.  He  sworn over the coal.  I was 
the one -- and then we cutting the wheat and 
knocking it out and getting out th
e little -- what they call it in 
English?   What they fill -- 
the cover is filled with it.  The wheat
 is filled.  The weights.  Well --  
 

Q:Chap?   

 

A:Yeah, right.  

 

Q: What did you all -- okay.  What did you do during the daytime?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
75 
 
 
A:Sleep.  And Edna and I couldn't do nothing.  And it's enough hard work.  My uncle will neve r 
forget.  He used to tell me , "You see, take 
a look at how bad people we are.  The huma n 
being is terrible.  You take and you beat
 up a horse.  You don't go fast enough or you 
don't pull strong enough, and then you get whipped and kicked and all that.  Move, move, 

up the hill.  We got enough -- a big          
holler at him to get up the hill.  We didn't go 
about it.  We didn't -- we complained to the horse and we whip him with the whip.  "And 

now we are the horses.  You are the horse a
nd I am the horse.  And now how is it?   How 
it feels?"  He  asked -- he been asking me  
how it feel being a horse.  I say, "Yeah, I'll 
never forget it being th
at horse."  Yeah.  
 

Q: We  need to change the type right now.  Okay?

Q:You had me ntioned that there were partisans 
in this same  area, and I was wondering whether 
you had contact with any of them.  But before 
-- I just want to clarify, where was this 
area exactly?   
 

A:Zezmer.  Zezmer.  It is a little town.  It was on
e street, people living in 
one street.  And there it 
was between Vilnius and Kaunas.  And there is
 a lot of woods, and it's the only place we 
had to pick, because the Germans wa s afraid
 for the woods.  The woods is a trap for 
them.  They were scared to death.  When th
ey already were in the woods and you seen a 
German group, even a battalion, could be 500, you don't have to worry about it.  They 

don't go fight.  They scared.  They look for another place for to run.  And it's what 

happened also with them.  And we were -- ev
ery time we heard -- we heard a shot, we 
were jumping for joy, because we seen here is
 Hitler getting beat and here we -- our time 
to be free is so close that you just touch it. 
 And he already seen the Russians plane right 
over our head.  You see that Paskofski had a 
lake, there's a lake on his land.  And we 
went there to swim and to lay in the sun.  It 
was foolish of us, too.  We  could get shot.  A 
German plane could seen here we'r e having 
a good time laying in the sun, and here we 
got to still fight a war.  
It they can shoot us.   
Q:You did this while yo
u were in hiding?   
 

A:In hiding.  It done like a fool
, didn't know what to do.  I just was worried.  And I told Eejicka 
(ph), I say, "Why are you in there? "  He was 
heading there on teaching the children.  You 
see, he didn't had nothing to do, and the kids he
 want to get educated.  He  didn't have any 

books.  They didn't know the alphabet.  Nothing.  He only worked from t he prayer book 

it's what they had.  He teach these boys how to read the alphabet.  And what he done, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
77 
 
they been sitting under a little 
hole, and there was a ray to -- a ray from the sun comi ng 
down, and it's  a wide clear place, and there 
he was sitting with these two boys, and he 
was teaching the bibl e.  And I tell him, "I am goi ng to take a swim."  He say, "Don't need 
a swim."  Well, but I done it.  
I done to the lake.  The next da
y I was smarter.  I talk to 
Paskofski, and I told him, " Would you ma ke me
 a bath?"  And he done.  He laugh a little.  
I say,           .  What he done, he took
 rocks he had, he put the rocks with wood, special 
wood in with the rocks, which red hot from the heat
, and there he been            and giving 
me  -- we us ed to say a shoulder, a cold s
houlder ma ke warm.  And 
it was just the best, 
best mo me nt in my life.  Many people ask me  wh
at I felt and what I 
want and what I used 
to at that mome nt.  I say the hottest and enj
oyable and best thing that happened to me  is 
getting the bath by Paskofski.  It give me -- it was terrific.  And then one day, I am sitting 

there.  I am walking in my office, and I take
 a look at farme r 's wife crying, carrying on.  I 
say, "What's  the ma tter, Mrs. Paskofski? "  
She say they locked up her husband.  I say, 
"Who locked up?"  She say, "The Russian comma nder.  They locked him up.  They say 

he don't want to go in the army."  I say, "T
ell him he's crazy."  Paskofski was a ma n 
already in the 70s, don't want to go in the ar
my.  I say, "Let's go.  We 'll take him out.  
Don't worry.  Don't cry.  I'll get him back."  
I took and I had a jee
p, put her in the jeep, 
and I went back to the place where we  were in hiding.  And I got in Zezmer, in one of the 

places between Vilnius.  And I told them, I sa
y -- I tell them who I am, and I came in here 
to get Paskofski out.  I say, "Why ar e you taki
ng and arresting a ma
n who is already 70, 
time already to die, and you lock him up because they find out a hidi ng pl ace?"  The ma n 

say that -- that captain, I don'
t know what, the major.  He say, "Well, you know what he 
done?"  I say, "He didn't done nothing."  He
 say, "What do you mean done nothing?   He  
took a bunch of drunks," and he say, "put them in a hole that they shouldn't  go.  They had 

to go register for the army.  They didn't  went 
to register for the army; they went to drink 
right there in the peats where -- what you bui
ld.  And the first thing I don't know is you 
done it."  I say, "Why ar e you doing?"  I say, 
"Ask my question.  How it looks and what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
78 
 
you want to know.  I ain't going to let you know fro
m the peat, if the peat is right or is a 
wrong peat."  We ll, and this gave me  -- I say, "All 
right.  Tell me  what 
if -- what is in that 
place and what is that place."  I ha d to ma ke a plan, and hey let him out.  And then I got 
Paskofski out.  I say, "Don't go out.  I'll take 
you back."  And it's 50 miles almost.  I took 
him back.  And anyway, I got Paskofski.  No
w Stasook, his son, he's the one that start the 
troubles.  He told the neighbor
s that is the refugees runni
ng and hiding in here.  They 
been there and they me ssed it up and he get bl
amed.  But they took him in the army.   
 

Q: We ll, I was asking you if when you were in hiding before the liberation you had contact with 
any of the partisans in the area.
  Did you ever run across them?   
 

A:Yeah, run across them, but it wasn't  much.  The y
 -- they -- in that area, they used to come  
regular  rout ine to get food.  And they been 
telling -- fi nd out there's a rich farmer, he got 

lot of meat, a lot of butter and all that stuff,
 they been asking.  They told him they go pay 
when you want to go pay, but you got to have 
food to eat and they 
got a lot of children, 
and it was a lot of groups, big groups.  And then 
the farmer wasn't  so anxious to give, and 
he told him a couple times, I say, "They don't 
wa nt any monkey business.  They want 
food.  They're not -- they'll take it alone.  Wh
en they'll take, they'll take everything that 
goes."  And they settled and they gave them f
ood to eat.  And it wasn't  such terrible.  But 

they were ready to fight with 
what killed a lot of them.  Th
e -- not the Lithuanians -- not 
the Germans, but the Lithuanians.  The Lithuanians say, "Woods doesn't  me an nothing, 

because they live in the woods.  The German
s di dn't go.  And the me n -- there was five 
explosions that let the railroad go, 
breaking the rail and been blown up.  
 

Q:So this was all going on around you?   

 

A:Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
79 
 
 
Q:Did it give you hope?   Wa s it encouraging?   

 

A:Yeah, that give me  hope.  I was encouraged
 already before, because the shooting was going 
around already so close, but beyond there, what
 -- what's  happened?   The Germans ha d 
that part of            occupied, and 
they been there having all kind of whiskey.  Wa s a 
distillery from vodka, and they big drunkards.  And when they came to that place, the 

Russians, they start drinking, 
and been drinking for three days, and got so drunk they 
were laying like dead.  And they didn't  
know wha t  was going on at that time.  The 
Germans come back and they really give them 
some  blows and they lost a lot of soldiers, 
the Russians.  And this me ssed up -- me ssed up 
the ghetto, because they were so close to 

get to Kovno.  Everybody was so anxious.  And 
Golub also, Tory, talk with the Miller 
from the Gestapo, and beg them and offer th
em a big amount of money, and told him to 
help see that his life will be protected, that
 nobody will touc h them.  But Miller di dn't go.  
Didn't took it.   
 

Q:Okay.  Let's -- now we can -- unless you ha
ve more to say about
 the hiding period.   
 

A:No, it's most of the hiding period.  

 

Q:Did you pray a lot or no?   

 

A:I didn't have from wha t  to pray.  I di
dn't have no books.  I prayed.  I did pray.  
 

Q:You thought God would help you out?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
80 
 
A:Right.  It was a nice,
 young ma n.  He remi nds  me  of what 
is it?  Christ.  Tall, nice looking 
young ma n was with me  in the working spot 
right by the place where the German ar my 
been moving out from Lithuania already back 
to Germany.  The army all been pulling.  It 
was a nice size, not too big, but it was a nice 
size.  And they pass by this part where we 
worked with the young ma n, his name  was Settl
eson (ph), and myself.  We were there 
around 30 people.  Our work was to rifeme ister. 
 Rife me ister.  I'd been a place of fixing 
ammunition.  
 
Q:Yeah.   

 

A:And we been staying and cleaning them.  And 
he knew the place.  And the boy -- and when he 
had -- ma de that a pl ace to hide, dugged out the hole and stayed there, and he was already 

lucky.  The army had been going passing by, the German ar my.  And the German sol dier, 

who was one of our workers, who worked with 
us to Gilligan's (ph)
 place, knew -- got in 
in the pl ace.  Maybe want to get a drink 
of water, ma ybe was looking for Mendleson.  I 
don't want what it was.  But Wilson, the neighbor, told me  that.  And he shot him in the 

back and killed him the last mi nute of the liberation.  And he was a tall, nice young ma n.  

And no luck, and finished.   
 

Q: When you went -- you told me  that the Russ
ians came in, you me t them, and your first thought 
was you wanted to go back to Kovno.   
 

A:Uh-huh, the ghetto.  

 

Q:So after you -- after the Ru
ssians liberated you, you went back to Kovno with them?   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
81 
 
A:No.  I went by myself.  I didn't need nobody.  I 
ran; I didn't walk.  Everybody was too slow for 
me .  I was flying.  
 
Q:By yourself?   

 

A:By myself to the ghetto.  People saying, "Wha
t's the matter, man?   What's you running?"  I 
told Mr.`Wilson, it was a ma n who let me  stay
 in his house, oh, a couple nights before I 

got settled in Kaunas.  But in the meantime, 
I went -- I went there by myself and I run in 
the ghetto.  I knew I had to see a picture.  Isee it, and it was terribl e st age for my eyes.  

Here is laying a hiding place with the man 
Monke y (ph), Monk's hiding place.  The name  
-- they call the nickname  Monk.  And he had th
e best possibility to ma ke a hiding place, 
because they had a money, they had the ma terial, and he done it.  And you couldn't find 

the place nowhere to search.  That's where he 
was.  My mother, she still was in his hole 
too, because they told me in ghetto ye t that my mother, "Don't worry about your mother.  

She got the best place.  She got the Monk's Meli
na," they call it.  And it was too hard to 
find it.  Nothing.  I went brick by brick, pi
ece by piece, looking around inside, in the peat.  

Couldn't find nothing.  I had to leave.  I 
had to ask the people, ma ybe the neighbors, 

ma ybe they know.  They say, well, they don't know what's  ha ppened.  Could be it was a 

lot of fire going on.  Wh en they used to find out the place that people didn't  report to go 

by train back to Germany, they used to put th
em on fire, burn them up.  And here is one.  
Another one was Vinetrop (ph), was anothe
r hi ding place.  And they say it's only a 
question of mi nutes they'll be liberated.  They were all full of hope that they'll be 

released, but it didn't work that way.  And th
ere was ma ybe about 10 people, they laying 
outside of the ghetto.  They al
so been put the place in the hiding on fire, but they start 
running and been shot and been killed and be
 laying.  There was a young girl, a friend of 

mi ne -- her father was a friend of mi ne, laying 
in front.  His father and mother all burned.  
And here going around -- and then people,
 funny, going around.  A woman with a big 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
82 
 
stick, with a long piece of me tal at th
e end, and digging in the groundlooking.  I say, 
"What you doing? "  He say, "I'm looking for 
the Jews' gold," it was the answer.  We ll, 
and come  ba ck.   
 
Q:The fi res were still going?   

 

A:Some  of t hem was glowing underneath, yeah.  Not -- 
it was all burned up.  It was nothing left.  
But some  of them were still.  And one -- one
 was lucky.  They did now.  Hoop (ph) was a 
rabbi, and the elf (ph) people,
 two handyme ns (ph) been hiding under a brick and under 
cement blocks.  A home s built on cement hard bl
ocks.  And they were -- they'r e laying in 
the baseme nt.  And also hided entrance 
that nobody -- or some body will come  and see 
and say, "No way to go in here.  Nobody's ther
e."  But the building 
collapsed, and all of 
them survived by mi racles.  They were holle
ring and hollering from the outside.  There 
was one rock keep the people up, don't let them to be squished.  And they got out.  

Some body helped them.  I was in there at that 
time, too.  Yeah.  It was awful.  Then I 
came back looking for my sister's furniture.  
My sister just got 
ma rried and she bought 
beautiful veneer, a bedroom se
t and a living room.  And ther
e was a Lithuanians, and she 
gave it to them to hold it.  Who'll come fi rst.  
If she'll come first, she'll take it back or I'll 
take it back or I'll buy it.  It was beautiful fu
rniture.  But I come  up to the building.  It was 
just a brand new building being built by a prof
essor from Lithuania, from the university.  
And it was a old woma n left.  They all disa
ppeared, the people who lived in that house, 
but I had to fi nd the furniture .  You could s
ee the table was st ai ned.  The coffee was still 

steaming, still going like steam.  And ham a
nd eggs and good -- a good me al.  They ate 

and left it half eaten, didn't  have time to finish
 to eat and they run o
ff.  And they run away 
and stay away for three months.  Finally, ge
t them back.  Wa s no use for me  to keep 
there, so I could go and buy me  a home.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
83 
 
Q:So you went -- did you then go back and get Edna and Jay?   
 

A:Yeah, right.  They still were in the far m th
ere by her uncle.  I went back and got them, brought 
them.  And I  went to work to my job.  Y
ou see, I was the second time under the Russians 
in that time.  I got my job as a dispatcher
.  And then I was the Jewish Council working 
for the different kind of trials with the co
mmunists and the people.  And I had problem 
with the survivors.  A lot of
 girls came  back, I think -- di
d I told you that?   See it was 
concentration camp come back, people to 
Lithuania, to Kovno, to Slobodka, come  
looking for their parents, for their relatives.  
And it wasn't  a job that was easy to find, but 
finally we got them together.  I was in char
ge of candy factories. 
 I was in charge of 
cakes.  All this stuff, I was in charge of it. 
 I had special groups in room, and we used to 
bake it and make it and sell it.  And when th
e Russian people used to get cards, card 
system.  They getting for cards so ma ny pounds of sugar, or for so ma ny pounds of sugar 

you getting so ma ny pounds of candy.  And that's
 the way I used to divide that everybody 

should get it.  Come s a holiday, I used to work
 it out that they should have some  sweet s 
for the holidays.  But then they start fi ghti
ng with each other.  Wo
ma n fight with each 
other.  It's a job, and I am in the mi ddle. 
 And what I done, I took 
-- I had to separate -- 
separate.  You a Jewish lady, you stay in that 
part of the table or that room, and you work 
in that room, and don't let them fight with each ot her.  
 

Q:You're talking about the Jewish pe
ople and the Lithua
nian people --  
 

A:Right.  

 

Q:-- that  were working for you?  

 

A:Right.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
84 
 
 
Q:Okay.   

 

A:But I kept them separated.  They couldn't have 
been fighting with each other.  They were -- in 
a way I can't  blamed them.  They we re hungry.  They had been eating the raw dough.  I 

could see they'r e eating it.  I say, "You'll ge
t sick."  No.  They were -- anyhow, they 
reported, and in come  -- the year, the Gestapo, they go and in come  -- in come  the 

criminal police.  And they called me  in and 
give me  a warning.  I say one more time and I 
go get caught, I'll -- they send me Siberia.
  And I have no business to mi ngle in 
governme nt business.  They were right, but 
I didn't  have no choice.  They were --  
 

Q:Now, why did they think -- 
what were you doing wrong?    
 

A: We ll, I didn't have the right to give away the s
ugar and give away the candies when they got to 
give for Russians by the Russian government.  
The Russian been giving it out.  It comes 
-- some body  come  with tickets, and ticket
s like here we have in the cards.  
 

Q:Uh-huh.   

 

A:Well --  

 

Q:How did you get this job?    

 

A:From --  

 

Q: When you came back, how did you get hired for this job?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
85 
 
A:I had the job already in 1940 before the wa
r.  Be fore the war was the Russians, the 
communists, together with the Germans togeth
er divided Lithuanian 
in half.  Half of 
Lithuanian Poland belonged to
 the Russians and half --  
 
Q:I thought then you were working fo
r a transportation cooperative?   
 

A:Right.  That was already later.  This was befo
re.  But later they were
 the cooperativ
e with the 
horse and buggy.  I worked for them, and they helped me  to get my job.  
 

Q:Oh, they helped you to get your job after the wa r?   

 

A:Right, after the war.  

 

Q:I see.  Now, let me  just ask you a question:  Wh en you went back to Kovno, did you -- did you 
ever think maybe I don't want to go back there?   
 

A: Where?   

 

Q:After the war --   

 

A:Right.  

 

Q:-- did you think ma ybe I should not go back to 
Kovno, things were very bad when I left?    
 

A:This doesn't  bother me.  I had a good job.  Ididn't -- and I didn't want to go.  I want to go 
back.  I want to find out what's  happened to 
my family, where was closest my fa mily.  I 
was so anxious.  And the people used to come
 and tease me  and teasing Edna saying, "I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
86 
 
me t you mot her back in Kennicksburg.  I me t your
 sister."  We were thinking it's true.  I 
say, "Well, we'r e going in Kovno and we go find out."  I came in Kovno and I see the 
Jewish girl go around to the 
Gestapo ma n.  It was  the captain from the brigade -- from 
Sunsulaga (ph) there.  They had a laga, what
 they call it?  A place of work that was a 
factory, and they been working at the factor
y.  And I don't remember the -- how it was in 
the details.  I had to give up.  
 

Q:But you didn't find your fa mily.  Were the 
Lithuanians -- when you came back, did the 
Lithuanians treat you okay?   
 

A:Yeah.  I think I had no troubles.  They wouldn'
t treat me, I wouldn't get a job.  I got a job.  I 
didn't have any problems at all.  But the Lithua
nians with the Jewish girls been fighting.  
And then I got five drums of gasoline came in.  I said, "What is that for?"  He say they 

don't know.  I got to take it.  I've been allo
cated fi ve drums of benzine for the trafay 
(ph)," which means the           .  And I 
need to go and find a ma chine or anything to get in 
Germany for home.  I said have enough gasoline,
 trucks are no problem
.  I said get it and 
bring it back.  They call it a trafay.  And th
at's the way it was with me.  I came home.  I 
start looking for fa mily.  I couldn't find nobody.  Decide to move on.  And then I had 

problem.  I say, no place for me  to stay.  I came to Munich.  And in Munich I --  
 

Q:Was it easy to get to Munich?  

 

A:It wasn't  easy.  I worked to move to Munich.  It wasn't  easy.  

 

Q:Tell me  about the journe
y.  How did you get out?   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
87 
 
A:I get out -- when I got a job, went to the Russi
an.  I stayed there and 
worked with them enough 
till the girls start fighting, a
nd I decide I go separate them.  One group here and one go 
there and there be peace.  And 
I put on a big sign, "No vacancie
s."  I don't have any work.  
They shouldn't  bother me, so let me  work. 
 And they reported, and they come  -- the 
Russian city police, and they come  and run 
to me  and they say, "Who give you the right" 
-- and I didn't  like that -- "to say who should live" -- I mean, "who should be the boss 
over the factory and who not.  You do what th
e governme nt tells you to do.  Don't do any 
wrong.  Here is you got to know is a Russian 
system, a communist system.  It's not a 
capitalistic way of doing it."  And they lay me
 out and put me  in jail.  And here I am 
laying there.  My luck was that the office was 
-- the office girl was a sister of one of my 
bosses for the Russians whom I was  working, an
d she went and called up her brother and 
told him that I am locked up.  And here my boss was a Russian captain, come  up.  He  

say, "What you doing here?   What's  happened? "  I say, "I don't know.  They locked me  

up."  "For what? "   I say, "They say I bought -- 
for gas, I bought a truck.  I had to have a 
truck.  What good is for me  four drums of gasoline when I don't have any truck?"  And 

this is the wa y the system works for  the Russians.  And they say, "Wait a mi nute.  They 

cannot tell you what to do, buy or not buy."  
And it was a general came up and he needs 
the gas, and you got the truck, and you got a me
rchandise he wants.  "I need your gas to 

swap you for a truck," and I got a opal (ph) car
 -- I mean an opal truck, a ton and a-half 
ton, for two drums of gasoline.  Then I had transportation 
around           , got two             
and a mechanic.  And everybody were work
ing.  Nobody was looking for jobs, and I 
gave them jobs.  But a girl report me , wh
at I was doing.  I told
 her -- I told them 
everybody, I say, "Come s the holidays, I'll 
give everybody candy.  Everybody have a kilo 
of candy.  But they should live in peace.  Th
ey shouldn't fight with each other."  And it 
didn't help.  And my bos s come  around one 
night, he say, "You know, you better run."  A 
communist tells me  I should run.  I say, "What yo
u mean?"  He say, "          , you run 
from here.  They'r e going to take you in Sibe
ria tonight.  You watch.  They'll come  a fter 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357

you."  And I -- then I had a truc
k, and I ran off.  Come  to Munich, me  and Edna and Jay.  
I didn't stay no more home.  I was a fraid.  And I told Edna, I say, "We are in a certain 
place.  We got to run away from the Russians.
"  They come t o -- they come to -- they 
came to me , and they got me  a job right ther
e working for J.D.C., American Jewish Joint 
Distribution Committee.  
 

Q:Okay.  Well, let me  ask you a couple of questions about Kovno after the war, if you don't 
mi nd.  Did the Jewish community th
ere start to rebuild itself?   
 

A:After the war?    

 

Q:Yeah.  When you were worki
ng there under the Russians.   
 

A:In Vilnius or in --    

 

Q:In Kovno.   

 

A:Yeah, that's  long.  It wasn't  -- there wasn't  so
 many.  They all come  in two and three at a time 
from Dachau, from Aus c hwitz, come  into Kauna
s.  And it was with 
nobody all in terrible 
shape, all broken up, all in pain, everybody cryin
g.  It was -- it was terrible.  And they 
couldn't build themself up, so they got to 
forget for a while.  I been discussing with 
doctors what I do when I have certain problems,
 and they told me, th
is will take a little 
while.  Let them cool off.  Don't worr y a
bout it.  They'll straighten themselves up.  
They'll stop fighting, because it
 be livelihood involved.  But 
it took a little while when 
they start to strai
ghten theirself out.  
 

Q:So you got to Munich --   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
89 
 
 
A:And from Munich --   

 

Q:-- and you got a job with the Joint Distribu
tion Committee.  What were you doing for them?   
A.    Transportation officer.  I was in charge ove
r the trucks and cars.  And see, it was so ma ny 
cars and trucks left over in Eur
ope, that Eisenhower decided to l
eave it in Europe.  He don't need 
them in the States.  Cost him more money to transf
er them over than to get rid of them.  And he 
say, "Here, you can take the trucks," and he gave
 the American Joint Dist ribution Committee.  I 
had 30 trucks together with jeeps.  And when 
speakers used to come  from the States talking 
about the future for humanity and all that, and I us
ed to get -- take my ow
n jeep, send the speaker 
to Landsberg, to Feldafing, to all of the German cities.  And they been gradually build 

themselves these communities.  I also came in 
at Munich here, they didn't have a synagogue.  
And I decided got to do it, to build a synagogue for 
the kids to go to school.  And I went to the 
head man of the -- of where my American Jo
int Distribution Committee 
sexton works.  Told 
him, "How can we be without synagogue, without
 a school?   I need a sc
hool and synagogue."  
They say, "Go to the governor.  The governor wi
ll give it to you."  I say, "Are you joking?"  
They say, "I'm not joking.  Go ahead."  I went to
 the governor, and I didn't 
know what's  all about.  
I knocked on the door.  I open up the door, and here
 I seen a big, heavy set ma n with a cigar 
sitting there, and also a German 
girl sitting next to him, and he
 asked the girl, he say, "Ask him 
what he wants."  And she asked me  what I want.  
I said, "I need a permit
 to build a synagogue in 
the English garden."  "Is ther
e a section?"  "A beautiful se
ction," I say.  "There is a place for the           
, and I would like it to get a permit."  Then the 
governor -- the person to send the ma n, I said, 
"You should go with me  in the P.X. and get cards and come  wi th me  to buy $500 P.X. and build 

a synagogue."  And I told the girl, I say, "Tel
l him it's not enough, 500.  I need more money."  
He looked at me .  "Look," he say, "I not a banke
r.  I don't have any money to give away, and 
don't bother me .  I gave you $500.  You want now
 -- I give you for a synagogue.  Now you want 
a synagogue and a school."  We ll, and I say, "Well,
 tell the girl, tell her $1,000 a piece"  And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
90 
 
build my -- for the kids a school.  And it was I ma rried off two of them who was working for me , 
and that is the way life.  Life 
started to get in
teresting back.  
 

Q:So you worked with -- did you work with some of the D.P. camps around there?  

 

A:Sure, with --  

 

Q: With Landsberg?    

 

A:-- Landsberg.  Landsberg, Feldafing.  Well, I got all those places.  

 

Q:What was the situation?  Were th
ey pretty well organized or --  
 

A:Yeah.  

 

Q:Landsberg, some  of these camps?  

 

A:Yes, sure, with the help fr om the United`States
.  The United`States used to send up speakers, 
teachers.  Yeah, they used to send up help.  They been organizing good.  Then to the 

ma jority was going to Israel.  And --  
 

Q:But now this was before 1948; so
 how did they get to Israel?   
 

A:No, it was after '48.  

 

Q:It was after '48?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
91 
 
A:Right.  Before -- before 1948 
there was -- there was not --  
 
Q:I know, but when you were there, it was before 1948.   

 

A:Oh, yeah, right.    

 

Q: We re people able to go to
 Israel at that time?  
 

A:Illegal.  

 

Q:Did you have any involvement with that?   

 

A:I was -- as I said, I was in charge of           .   
          means to break
ing in.  I was in charge of it 
because I had the trucks.  I used to get them out a Triptic (ph) , and ride into go into 

Berchtesgaden.  And this was there that docum
ent.  They didn't have nothing.  And then 
when they caught them, the person, they didn't caught them so easy.  It wa s once I been 

caught, arrested, got out.  Why?  
 Because they told the M.P. th
at they got lost.  They were 
going to Landsberg, and the way to La ndsberg 
was wind up to Feldafing or the going to 
-- what is the other one?  St
utthof.  And they wind up to Constance (ph).  That was the 
place.  And that's the way they got a lot of Je
ws came  into Israel, because of me .  I gave 
-- they didn't know that I would be bringing th
em up      , paying them, and taking them 
out, bringing them to Munich.  
 

Q:So you were using money from the Joint Distribution Committee to --  

 

A:To build --  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
92 
 
Q:-- to help them get --  
 

A:To help -- to help.  From the Joint Distribu
tion Committee, I couldn't.  It was belong to the 
governme nt, and it been given to me  in P.X. 
 P.X. was special dollars.  It wasn't  the 
regular dollar bills like we  have.  The sold
iers in the army got a P.X. was a place for 
dollar bill.   
 

Q:And I'm just a little confused.  

      I understand that you were providing trucks --   

 

A:Right.  

 

Q:-- so that they could travel.  And you understood 
their plans and their rout
es and all of that?   
 

A:Right.  I used to bring -- mostly they went to Constance.  Constance was in Austria, a port 
city, and an illegal moveme nt 
was going right from Constan
ce.  They only had to bring 
the people right there.  You bring them ther
e, from there no more problem because along 
them both, they going.  After they been stra
ighten out between the payments, it was my 
business.  This is organizations been handli
ng the how to get it food, 
how to get it all paid 
for it.  It was their job.  
 

Q:Did -- did the Joint Distribution Co mmittee or th
e U.S. military governme
nt, did any of these 
people know what was going on and they just let it happen?  
 

A:Sure, they know.  Some of them ke ep their ey
es closed, didn't  watch.  The only thing I had, 
yeah.  In Munich they come  to me , a nd th
ey say that the ma yor and the governor for 
Munich find out.  I'll tell you how he find out. 
 I belong to Naborite (p
h) at that time .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
93 
 
Naborite is also a Jewish or
ganization that helps the poor, and they were active.  And 
they came to me  and they say, "Look, we got
 a job.  We  need three trucks very bad, 
because I got to transpor t Jews to go to Israel
, and we got to have the trucks."  Well, I 
told them, " Why don't  you go to Schwartz," 
George Schwartz, was the head ma n from 
Paris.  "Go to Schwartz and talk with him." 
 He say, "I've been already to Schwartz, and 
Schwartz tell me , he say, go and talk to Ipson.  And don't come  to me , a nd please don't 
me ntion my name ."  He was scared to d
eath.  He say, "Ipson already went in the 
concentration camp.  He's not afraid, but I'm af
raid.  I don't want that."  Well, and jeep 
come , takes me  to the governor.  I didn't know where it was.  Takes me  to the governor 

who I was before.  And I told him, I said, 
"Governor, you put me  in trouble."  He say, "I 
put you in trouble? "  He say, "What kind of trou
bles I did? "  I say, "Now, look.  Now, my 
M.P. want I should give him jeeps with         
    , with the roof," because a jeep -- an army 
jeep was open.  And I say, "I got to have it wi
th the roof.  And, "I don't have any."  I say, 
"I don't have any either.  From where I want, 
you can get it.  I tell you what I'll do.  I got 

three trucks.  Each truck, a jeep.  Each j
eep you put me  a roof, you get your truck back."  
And that's what I done.  I put in
 three roofs; I got three trucks
 back.  And then he tells me  
-- in Muni ch.  This was I came in Israel, a
nd I became the chairman of the Naborite.  
They come  and want to elect there is a ma n fr
om Florida.  They say they don't want me .  
I am            and belong in Richmond.  I 
have nothing to do with Florida.  And we went to 
the election, got to be elected.  We ll, I mea
n, when I start talking 
about my -- what I done 
and I'd like to get a job as district 
commissioner, and then screwed up.  I say, 
"Mr.`President -- Mr.`Chairman, I know that ma n.  He was from the one of the Naborite 

people."  He say, "You know me ?   I don'tknow you."  I say, "Yes, I know you.  You 

don't know me ."  He sa y, "Well, what do you want
 me  to do?"  "Nothing.  I want that you 
should let me speak to the people to talk a
bout him."  We ll, he sa
y, "All right.  Tell you 
what I'll do.  After I'll finish, then you come  in
 and speak and talk to
 the people as long as 
you want."  It come s -- he starts speaking a
nd he spoke for me.  I didn't even speak to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
94 
 
them and I got elected.  But when he -- before
 he start, I say, "Wait a mi nute.  Don't -- I 
can let you speak, but first explain to the pe
ople from where you know 
me , what I done to 
you."  And I start telling them 
about all the trucks and all the jobs and what I -- with 
emigration, with all that me ss, and I got elec
ted.  He came to Edna, he say "I got to 
congratulate you.  Your husband won the election.  He say, "You bet your wife got 
excited."  He  was the governor from Munich. 
 A big job.  I didn't even know about it.  I 
didn't know what a governor got to do withit.  And then when they heard it was the 

governor from Munich, it was fi
nished.  I won it.  Yeah.  
 

Q:How long did you stay in Munich?   

 

A:Two years.  

 

Q:Three years.  And now, did I 
understand that you also were in 
Nuremb erg, that you went --  
 

A:Yeah, right.  Right.  

 

Q: What -- why did you go there?  What --   

 

A: We ll, Benger Young (ph) -- you know Benger Young was?  Benger Young used to come  each 
time, and he used to go to Basel, to the congress.  He 
used to stop at Munich to see the            
like that, the survivors.  And there have been
 talking with all kind of dreams , what he 
could do and what Israel got.  And like it's hi

trial in Nuremberg.  We ll, very interested, 
so for some  reason he
 wants to learn, know

.  He'll give you already a good car, and you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357

say, "Okay."  I had a 
old Jewish taxi.  I 
had a taxi.  I was staying there by the airport a
ll the time.  I say -- and he can't forget.  I 
say, "Alta (ph)" -- Alta wa s his name , "I got 
a job for you."  He say, "What is that? "   And 
I say, "A job to take this gentlema n, Mr
.`Benger Young, and take him to Nuremberg.  
You'll go and Karken (ph)," and Karken was 
the man from the storage room, "he'll give 
three canisters benzine. 
 They should last, and Mr. Benger Young and you into 
Nuremberg."  They go.  Then, that's try to 
-- Alta, looked him over, you had to see, exam 
him from one end to the other, Benger Young. 
 And he say, "I am sorry.  I don't go with 
that snower (ph)."  You know

Huh-uh.  You get some body else.  I don't want it
."  From anytime that I get it with 
some body with American Jew gives me  a jeep, th
at snower, I got to give him a jeep.  He 
don't have nothing.  I felt terrible, you know
, doing that first to Benger Young.  He don't 
know who Benger Young was.  Anyway, I explained to Benger Young.  He was hot.  
And I say, "Well, tell you what you do.  I'll go 
by myself when I take you to Nuremb erg."  
He say, "You would?  The big boss by himsel

"No.  What I am doing, tomorrow morning you get 
ready.  I'll tell me  wife  that I'm goi ng 
away for Nuremberg and I'll be away for two 
days, and I'll come back and then I will be 
with them," and fine.  And I went by myse

within Nuremberg, and I told Benger Young, I said, "Look, we ma ke a deal.  I am taking 

you to Nuremberg and take you back to Munich, but you got to know one thing.  We  got 

to do it in one day, and -- number one.  And numb

And Benger Young come out, ask me  to go in with him.  The y had to open up the door.  

The M.P.s was very happy.  Okay.  Trial is

And I told Benger Young, " We  got to move.  
We cannot stay.  We  got to go home.  It's
 getting dark."  Be

I got to have transportation."  He say, 
"We 'll sleep in the jeep."  "You think it's 
summertime now?   What do you want, to die?   
Uh-huh, no going in the jeep."  We ll, fina

And I told them, I say, "Look, I need a room w
ith two beds.  And when you go give me , I

floor, and it's the only one you can get.  I don't 
have another one."  I say, "Wait a mi nute.  
Let me  take a look."  I run up upstairs, took 
a look.  I say, "Well, we can sleep.  That

 a flag is imnay sip dice (ph)", 
anywhere the dice.  And that's when he doe
s when it's in emigration we couldn't get a 
bed, just anyplace is good.  And I gave him th

murderers, the faces.  Goring and 
Frick and all the rest of them.  
It's very, very, very -- I would say you seen 
the murderers in front 
of you.  You see where 
they killed so ma ny people.  It's -- it was 
unbelievable.  I couldn't believe it.  Benger

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
97 
 
Q: When you were working in Munich, were you 
working -- did you have to do business with a 
lot of Germa n people?   
 
A:Only ones who fix the -- build the temple, syna
gogue.  That's  only with them.  And i f you got 
a couple buildings, they claim the buildings.  Th
en I had a repair shop to repair the cars 
and trucks, and then I had Germans doing that.  
 

Q:But it's no problem?   

 

A:No, it was no -- with me  it was no problem.  They
 knew they had cigarettes they could get.  
They had the opportunity -- I had to have a door. 
 Pack of cigarettes I got me  a door.  The 
Germans knew everything, where it lays, everyt
hing, where -- the longer, whose it is.   
 

Q:So you stayed in Munich for two years?   

 

A:Right.  

 

Q:Now, did you -- had you tried to get 
out or where did you want to go?   
 

A:I want to go in Israel.  It was my plane -- my 
plan was to go to Israel.  And because I was in 
brought up in that atmos phere.  I went in high
`school, so I we nt every day and all that.  I 
was in Israel a few times, and I loved Israel. 
 And the way to go in legally, I want.  I 
didn't want to go in illegally, because, well, w
ith a small child.  And I decide anything I'll 
do to go to Israel.  We ll, England gave out 
1500 certificates for the legal emigration, not 
the illegal, and been divided 
with all of the organization, wi
th Musraki (ph), the Zionists, 
and the labor, and the Epsonists 
(ph), all the groups.  All of th
em want me to go to Israel.  
Because I ma de a deal, I talk with Benger 
Young, and we'r e going to Israel to open up a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
98 
 
transportation office in American style.  We  
buy trucks and all that me ss.  And the plan 
would work when I could have a little help.  
And I came to -- to go 
to Israel, they took 
away one certificate if
 you worked all over less two.  If it weren't for Jay; it weren't for 
my wife.  And I come  back home after work and I told Edna, I'm not excited.  I say, 
"Now, look, we'r e going to Israel next week."
  I say, "What you mean?"  I say, "Here I 
got the certificate.  Got from England, got legal --
 legally."  I say, "    
       , where the 
third one? "  She got hot and got
 into Goldma n (ph).  He's the big ma n in that time  from 
the Jewish agency.  She got into the Jewi sh agency and start carrying on, and she say 

"Hitler didn't separate us; you don't go separate 
us."  You don't ever dare -- nerve to 
separate me  and her after the war.  Hitle
r couldn't do it, and she say you want to do.  
Forget it.  I am going to America.  You don't wa
nt to take us there, just forget it then.  
She took us -- she didn't even told me .  The 
girls that was working there in Munich and 
they helped her.  And they 
had asked her she hold out her 
application.  She had a uncle 
and aunt with the Pepsi-Cola plant here 
in Richmond belong to him.  And he was a 
supporter for the Senator Byrd.  And Senator Byrd came to -- he called him up, and he 

say, "Look, I help you, but I'm not a wealthy ma n now, but you got to help me  at this 

time the way I want.  I got a nephew.  He's now
 i n Munich.  He wants to come .  So we 
got to have a certificate, a vi
sa for them."  He didn't  know
 how ma ny want, and he wrote 
to Byrd.  And Byrd went to for to Yonkers 
and got three visas -- I mean two visas, not 

three.  And we didn't answer -- or enter with
 only -- what can we do 
with only two?   We 
need the third one.  Well, until 
the war to end, it came from the States.  It came in a visa 
for me  and for Edna and for Jay.  And it was t
oo late.  And I was so upset.  I want to go 
there and I wind up here.  And upset, and th
e way it went.  So me time, you know, it's not 
up to you.

guy -- young ma n, comes into New`York with th
e bruke (ph) sack on his shoulders and 
looks around the big buildings.  And he say, "l
e gullis, le gullis (ph) ."  He  say for one 
gullis -- you know what a gullis is?  I don't 
know if I got -- if I got it ba d language.  
 

Q:Sorry.   

 

A:Well, it's all right.  Gullis and --  aspera (ph) . 
 From the aspera to the aspera.  And then it's 
another one.  Here he goes in
 with the same  bruke sack.  He come s in New`York free -- I 
mean in Israel free, because a big shot, a
nd he say, "From as pera to freedom."  And it 
ma kes a difference between one and the other.  
 

Q:And that's  what how you felt wh
en you arrived in New`York?   

 

A:Right.  Right.  Right.

Q:You felt that you were still in the --  

 

A:I feel even right here.  It
 is good.  It's  cold,            fine
, beautiful, terr
ific, but I still mi ss it.  It 
is a still going on there what -- it
's all strained now.  To ever
y nation got to deal with all 
their problems.  And you know, the problem 
what's happened, it's happened everywhere.  
And not a place in the world where they don't fi
ght.  If it weren't we fighting, for land.  
It's all they fighting for, because of land.  
And soon they'll get all land and stop fighting.  
There wouldn't  be no mo re fight.  And they'll 
have it.  They'll get together.  The Jewish 
people are smart people, no dummies.  They 
know what they doing.  And they not trying 
to take from nobody nothing.  And after they go 
settle, they'll buy from them a piece of 
land fr om            and they will 
pay the other one and get it straight.   
 

Q: What were the -- what was the hardest pa
rt about adapting to being in America?   
 

A:Hardest part adopting?   

 

Q:To adapt, to adjust  to the new life here.   

 

A:First thing is language.
  It is the very first one.  And 
the second one is the education, the 
economy.  Well, I really don't kno
w.  I am not a politician.  
 

Q:But for you personally, was it hard to adjust?   

 

A:For me , no.  No.  I wasn't  afraid for work, 
nothing bother me.  I went through so hell.  So 
many places were only hell.  And I get in through, and I was nothing.  Wh en I came in 

this country, you know what 
I done?   I open up a gasoline 
station.  You know what a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
101 
 
gasoline station is?   I 
opened it up, run a servi
ce station.  And I'll never forget there were 
about two gentleme n -- one is a lawyer and one
 a judge -- to my se
rvice station on Kerry 
(ph) Street in Richmond.  A
nd talking and arguing in English.  And I say -- that the 
lawyer asked the judge about a question he don'
t know what to answer him.  And I told 
him in Latin the question what he's asking.  He look at me .  I say,           , and justice, 
power, governme nt, and all that.  And I look ar
ound, and the judge took a look at me .  He 
say, "Look, what you doing here?"  
I say, "I run the station." 
 He say, "Wa it a mi nute.  
You don't run that station.  Come to me tomorro
w I'll give you a job."  The judge told me .  
And the lawyer -- Istovatz (ph), and I forgot 
the lawyer's na me.  I say, "No, I can't.  I 
don't go ma ke -- I got to make 
a living."  He say, "I go pay you good."  I say, "Still not 
enough.  When I would go away to go, I would 
go into my own trade."  He say, "What's 
your trade? "  I say, "Law.  I would become  a la
wyer.  I would want to
 do that, but I can't 
do that here, my handicap."  "What do you 
mean your handicap?"  What I know, I don't 
know the language.  I don't know what to do.  I 
would get lost.  Huh-uh.  I don't want it."

Q:This ma y sound like ki nd of a strange question, 
because I think there were different points at 
which your life became more and more difficult.
  But is there one mo ment when what we 
say "the Holocaust," when that really be
gan for you, when you realized how serious the 
situation was?  
 

A:In what year?   

 

Q: We ll, you tell me .  At what point did you realize th
at this wa sn't  just a short war or that things 
were really very, very, horrible for the Jewi
sh people?   When did that begin for you?   
 

A:It begin as soon as we got in into the ghetto. 
 It was you take a human being and lock him up.  
Lock me  up, but I wasn't  -- wasn't  ready to be
 locked up.  I was still 
in my prime life.  I 
was 39 years of age, and they'r e going to lock me  up.  And then the pagrom.  What I 

couldn't take it is the Lithuanians.  I had Lit
huanians lawyers, fr iends.  They used to -- 
like for Passover, for example.  I used to ta
ke five, six judges comi ng with me  and we 
having the Passover services.  I was so close.  Stenitis (ph).  They had told me two           .  
One was Stenitis, was a good friend of mi ne, 
Stenitis.  His brother.  And say, oh, I 
mi ngled with them, friendly.  I know I'm alive because they -- when the city pa grom was 

going out -- going around, they come up to my 
house and stopped.  Why?  I am positive 
sure that one of my friends was Hollincare 
(ph), say, "You don't go to Ipson.  Skip that 
house," because I have a feeling that they were 
going next to me .  Bu
t I still, st ill here.  
Some body stopped.  We ll, that what was a difficult 
life.  And then the nice people, Edna's  
fa mily, losing Edna's fa mily in -- in two 
mi nutes.  And I was hot and angered at the 
Jewish police.  They didn't  have to be involve
d in that kind of thing.  I lost twice people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
103 
 
because of bi g shots.  I could be a police any time.
  They all life is wh
at's difficult.  It was 
not what's  not difficult.  And like with here, 
a life not concern it does.  When I came  in 
this country, I went to work for Edna's 
uncle, who was an uncle the Pepsi-Cola owner 
from Pepsi-Cola in Munich -- in Richmond.  An
d I worked hard for her uncle.  I wouldn't 
even let me smoke a cigarette.  One day he co
me s in and he stop where I stay at night and 
working, and he tells me , I say, "Well, what
 you going to do next? "   I say, "I don't know 
yet."  I say, "Well, I got a job for you," her uncle
 tells me .  I say, "What is it? "   I say, "To 
run my bottle machines.  I have troubles with
 the machines, and the mechanic there is a 
drunk.  Every day he's  drunk, and I'm in troubles.
  I got to have my equipment working.  I 

can't  make any money.  I can't  make a living 
the machines staying still."  I say, "What 
you want from me ? "   "I want to give you a better job you got."  The job I'm talking, 1947, 

he been paying me  $65 a week.  I say, "Well,
 I'm not interested in doing nothing."  He 
say, "I give you $100 week."  I say, "Give me
 $100 a week?   What I going to do with 
$100?"  Well, "Tell me why you won't.  What
 is your reason," he say, "when you were 
able to do yourself better."  He was a smar
t man, the old man.  I asked him the queston.  I 
told him, I say, "Look, America is a country of
 wheels.  Everything goes on wheels.  You 
go stay and look.  Go take a look, how ma
ny whe e ls pass by in the mi nutes we'r e 
standing and talking to each ot
her.  Everything goes on wheels,
 and I want to roll with 
them.  I don't want you to stop me  fr om rolling.  I -- what good is for me  your job?   I'm 

not too much interested."  And here I 
tell you another mi stake 
you ma de.  You know, you 
got to be -- in life you got to be careful.  
Here come s Serret (ph).  Serret -- you reme mber 

Serret?  Serret was the foreign mi nister fr
om Israel who was before in Benger Young's 
times.  And he deliver a speech in Richmond. 
 I was at his speech ma king.  After he 
finish speaking, I come  with
 the uncle and I introduce hi
m in Hebrew, introduce him 
Serret.  And he tells to Se rret,
 "You know, I want to build a plan
t of Pepsi-Cola in Israel.  
Can I do it?"  I say, "Sure, you can do it.  No
 question about it.  But it will be certain 
requireme nt.  You know, one thing that -- 
Israel got enough grapes, got enough food, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
104 
 
they can ma ke the syrup, they ma ke from all that stuff from our ingredients."  He say, 
"Well, but you know, I want to build for my gr
andchildren," Edna's uncle tells Serret.  I 
say, "Well," he say, "I build for them a future."  Then it made me  hot.  I say, "You want 

me ," I say, "go to Israel, vote for you to secu
re the life for your grandchildren, and my 

grandchildren shall work for you?   No, 
I'm not going.  I don't want that."   
 

Q: What do you think it was about
 your background that ma deyou strong, that got you through 
all of this the way you did?   
 

A:Made you strong?    

 

Q:That gave you the strength to 
survive all of this. 
 Was it something a
bout your background?   
 

A:Right.  Right.  

 

Q: What?   

 

A: Without my education, I wouldn't be able to 
accomplish nothing.  Everyt
hing education helped 
me .  It was not hard for me .  When I t
ook the job, I knew the language.  I knew the 
history of the people.  I knew what to sa
y and what to do.  And -- what I should say 
"Yes" and not say "No."  The only trouble I --
 rema ined after the war me  and Edna, but 
no more closer people.  We couldn't help it.  
Only want to have a little happiness.  More 
happiness here right now.  I got a good busin
ess.  Everything all right, but still not 
fulfilled.   
 

Q:It's still not fulfilled?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
105 
 
A:Huh-uh.  Still not fulfilled.  
 

Q:After the war when you came ove r to the United
`States, did you talk -- did -- at least among 
your fa mily, did you talk 
about your experiences?   
 

A:They knew.   

 

Q:I know they knew, but did you talk about it together?  

 

A:Yes.  I talked, and they didn't like 
to hear it, to be honest with you.  Th
ey didn't -- back           , 
I think we are talking.  A lot of them they thi
nk that I telling a lie, th
at I am not telling the 
truth, because they figure that a pe rson couldn't survive, coul dn't  go through life with that 

kind of a problems all day after day.  And they
 didn't want to listen.  They didn't want to 
listen.  They didn't want me  to speak no more.  And not only me , all the survivors.  Don't 

talk.  It was a rough time  un
til lately, yeah, the museum he
lps a little.  But until the 
museum come, they don't want -- nobody want 
to listen.  I say, "The American people 
don't listen to us anyhow.  They'r e used to talkin
g.  They are used to doing.  It's  a waste 
of time."  
 

Q: We re you able to put it behind you then?   

 

A:I did.  Right now a lot of thing here.  When I 
came in this country           , I got a 
brother-in-law here liv
ing with me  this month, Edna's sister's husband.  And I told him, 
"Milton, you know, let's go ma ke 
-- I got a good business for us 
both together.  Let's go in 
partners.  I got two businesses.  One business,
" I say, "you can pick auto parts.  Open up a 
business auto parts.  You be the salesman.  
I 'll tell you what to sell, you go and sell it, 
only sell it.  Or a paper clip 
factory.  Why?   Why a paper c
lip?  A paper clip factory, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
106 
 
can run it by yourself.  You don't need any he
lp.  The machinery runs it, and you ma ke a 
living.  Only thing you need is to go on out a
nd sell it, to go to the wholesaler -- paper 
wholesaler and sell it."  And I say, "You w
ould be perfect for me , because you know the 
language, and you just got back from the army, and you the right ma n."  "No," he say, 
"take it easy.  I don't want that kind of busine
ss.  I don't want it."  He is nothing, have 
nothing.  He's a big nothing.  What I beg him to
 be a me mber -- a partner with me, and I 
have anything I want.  I got an apartment.  I sa
y I can get him $200,000 and from            
fingers.  I got a machine shop.  I got one piece of machinery just $250, the cranks and 

grinder.  I have the best machinists in Ri
chmond working for me .  We ll, and now with 
Jay in the business, and Jay already working 
on his little one, he s
hould be -- yeah.  And 
first thing he come s in he runs 
into the computer and types.   
 

Q: What sort of -- how do you feel that your ex
periences during the war, during the Holocaust, 
affected the way you live your life now or 
the way you lived your life for the last 40 
years or so?   Do you think it ha
d a lasting impact that ma de
 you do things differently or 
value certain things differ
ently than you mi ght have?   
 

A:I tell you, I know -- I'm sure I had to do it.  I'm 
sure I done it.  While in my business I felt out 
that you cannot leave it out a community.  You got to be a community person.  You got 

to see to help, to be active           , to be
 active.  And I am.  I got more awards -- I say, so 
ma ny sticker.  But I got a Distinguished Co
mmunity Service Award.  I got a Christian 
Jews Conference.  I got a Naborite Service Awa
rd.  I got a Naborite top lot president -- I 
got plenty.  And it's not because I got pushing 
it out.  No, the way it comes itself.  I feel 
because I went through life so different 
variations, move me nts, that now everybody -- 
everybody.  I say everybody.  A lot of people co
me  to me  as k advices.  Why do they ask 
for advices?   For my experience.
  I we nt through hell.  I give
 my advice.  I say, "What's 
the ma tter?   You going to tell me  I don't know
 what I'm talking about or you don't know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
107 
 
what you talking about?   You don't know what
 you want.  You know what you want.  But 
you got to make up my mi nd."  People want to
 go and want to have it done for nothing.  
You can't  get nothing for nothing.  Well --  
 
Q:Is there anything today that frightens you, that
 takes you right back to that bad period?   
 

A:Right.  Didn't I me ntion to you?   Funny how we 
talk sometimes.  I can't  reme mber with whom 
I spoke.   
 

Q:Tell me.   

 

A:That now the governme nt repeat, 
it repeats itself.  Particularly
 Europe.  They -- the Balkans, 
what's  going on in the Balkans is terrible. 
 And who go have the -- we go expect a war 
with the Lithuanians and Poles.  I don't know
.  I  have a feeling like that, because they 
going the same  way as they went in 1947, '48.  
 

Q:And that frightens you?   

 

A:That frightens me .  Who wants to have it?  
We  had enough.  We  don't  need any wars no more.  
And the way it's going now, you never know what
's  going to happen.  They still cannot 
settle between theirselves the arguments.  
The politicians, they 
are a bunch of no-goods.  
 

Q:Is there anything, just the ordi
nary life in the United States, 
that frightens -- that ma kes you 
think of the past and --  
 

A:Yeah, there was a easier life.  Now we going 
-- we going over a new period of life which we 
can't  compar e.  Now the computer price -- th
e computer life, I mea
n.  The  computer life, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
108 
 
it's a new way of life, and it is changed the hum
an being.  In the next 10 years, we don't  
go recognize ourself.  
 
Q:But I may be -- I'm not explai
ning my question very well.  
      What I'm trying to ask you is, if in just 
the daily life today there ar
e certain things, certain 
sounds, certain things you see orthink about, that all 
of a sudden ma ke you reme mbe r  some thing 
50 years ago and are very disturbi
ng that bring it back to you?  
 

A:The street life.  It is terribl
e.  The murders, mu rdering, suin
g each other, children problems.  
The cancer problems, cancer sickness.  They w
ould kill this cancer 
when they would put 
their mi nd in it.  I don't believe it, it's not th
at it couldn't be conque
red.  But every other 
thing,            all kind of items, and th
e making the life mi serable 
for their own self in 
place of ma king it beautiful, beautiful life.  Bu
t they don't straighten out, it will be rough, 
because I can see a lot of -- a lot of
 fights here going on.  And, well --  
 

Q: What me ssage should we learn from all of this
?   From everything you've told me , what should 
some body who's listening to this take away
 from it, the most important thing?   
 

A: What people should learn from this?    

 

Q:Yeah.   

 

A:They should learn a new life, because a life is 
now come  to a dead point.  And mo stly land is 
controls the people's life.  La
nd and girls, and all the fights with one with each other, 
killing each other.  Here it's not as bad as in 
little Richmond.  It is a village.  It's not a 

night for two, three killings.  Blacks, whites. 
 Mostly blacks.  Whites is not so bad.  But 
still a human being, I don't care who it is.  A
nd some thing life itself, when itself without 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
109 
 
help and change.  Life need help.  It needs to
 get out from their assist ance.  We need to 
help the economy got to have a boost.  A
nd, well, too much inner fighting between one 
and the other.  Very, very hard.  They still talking?    
 
Q:Yeah.  Do you think in the world, is
 religion really that important?   
 

A:No.  No.  I don't care about relig
ion.  Religion brings no -- we got
 to be mi xed in between one 
and another.  It's rough.  And it started in Ira
n.  It were the biggest problems .  And then 
there's Lebanon -- the Middle East, another war should come  up.   
 

Q:But you are a practicing Jew?   

 

A:Yes.  

 

Q:Religion is important to you?   

 

A:Right.  Because -- well, it is religion like 
here.  Listen two week
s ago was a rabbi in 
Richmond.  He been talking.  And he say the on
ly thing what he want
s is to conservative, 
conservative Jew.  And he say there, what
 we got to do every day, we got to put on 
chilum (ph).  You know what chilum is?   Y
ou know up around there.  And we got to see 
to help and to do and to pray.  And it woul
dn't give me  nothing.  All this, what's we get 
for the huma n being.  Right now we still 
don't see nothing.  We say -- I didn't see yet 
after 50 years to get rid of Hitler would star
t comi ng back, everything.  Here I've been 

talking 50 years ago to the same  far mer, Pa
skofski, living outside and talking to Mr. 
Paskofski, "What do you think about life?"  That
's what we be talking.  I'd be asking him 
right there by the door from the Holocaust. 
 And he say, "You know, you so right.  You 

so right."   That I say, "Let's -- I can tell you 
one thing.  We still going to have a beautiful 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
110 
 
life in front of us.  I don't see it 
yet."  I talk to         
  .  I know him.  He came to 
Richmond, a nd I talked with him.  I say, "T
ell me some thing.  I cannot understand how 
come  until this day nothi ng didn't been done about the Holocaust."  He say, "Such a 

tragedy happen to the Jewish people, what
 have you done about it?  You should know 
what to talk.  It's  you should know how to an
swer the questions.  Where are you?   What 
you doing?   You're telling me             ,"
 it's a little story where they mean nothing.  He 
say, "Let me  tell you some thing.  History is 
not written in a day.  History doesn't  been 

written in a month.  History takes years to wr
ite.  The Holocaust will take 50 years before 
the hist orian will start doing anythi ng."  Right
.  Smart.  I say, "You right.  I agree with 
you on that."  But don't wait until 200 years; 50 
years is enough.  We  lived the 50 years, 
and now give us what we need.  Give  us 
peace.  It's enough.  I was with him for a good 

while.  He's a smart man.  Some of t hem didn't  
like him, but I liked him.  He is one of the 

prophets.  Ve ry interesting.  
 

Q:Is there anything else you want 
to -- I don't have any more ques
tions.  Is there anything else 
you want to say?   
 

A:I don't know.  The ma in thing what I want to sa y was to get ready of thought of Holocaust.  
We should never -- not have any Holocaustproblems .  We should be out of the books.  

We should get ready world, all the dopes (ph) 
and all the sickne sses and all the killings.  
It's unbelievable to be seen a person toda
y, a young person start dying because of nothing 

been done about it.  A week ago a man, a good friend of ours, he's  only 56 years of age.  

Cancer.  All why?   Well, his time comes, he 
got to go, they say.  That is their answer.  

That's  not the answer.  The answer is we
'r e not doing enough.  I reme mbe r  when my 

grandfather died at what, 56.  He was alrea
dy old ma n.  He died, and he was 56 years of 
age, but he can still live another 30.  We
ll, well, some times you done a lot of wrong 
things to yourself.  You can be smart e
nough.  You need help and other people too to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0357  
111 
 
advise you.  Life is not a life of one ma n.  We
 ha ve certain people think they are.  Get 
along, they're not.   
 

Q:Okay.   

 

A:Right.  Well, there -- Jay wouldn't -- well, I 
were thinking Ja y will be tomorrow.  What you 
doing tonight?
