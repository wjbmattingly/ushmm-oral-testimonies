ELISABETH MODEL 
September 11, 1990 
 
Q: Okay. The camera is on. Would you tell me  your name  please? 
 

A: Elizabeth Model. Dickman Model. 
Di ckma n was my ma iden ma iden na me. 
 

Q: And where and when were you born? 

 

A: I was born in Bayreuth in Bavaria in the 
as they say. That had a great influence on my  
early youth only when Mother was Latvian at th
e. There was always singers comi ng and staying 
in our house and things like that, and started 
later to resent  it terribl y much because I 
hated...started to hate. Couldn't be helped. I hadone little episode when I 
was a little girl. I met 
this fabulous old gentlema n who l
ooked like Wa gner. I feel into hi
s arm when I was 12 years old. 
He was a poet and a writer, and he wa s a Latvian and so far he was a friend of Wa gners and 

came to rehearsals in Bayreuth, and so I me t him 
and he went off to Munich, sent me  tickets. He 
was wonderful. And one day he called me  in the st
reet and said I have to
 come . I said why. He 
said, "I have to talk to you.ﬂ So I run. Ther
e was this old ma n pacing up and down and he said, 
"When I die, all these things, they'll die with me
.ﬂ I said, "What? " He said, "About Wh en I heard, 
I said, "I don't want to heari
ng anything about Wagners. But he 
said you have because with me  
he dies. And he's  die I don't want to have anythi
ng to do with the Wa gners. so far that I just 
didn't want to have anything about them. That 's
 strange but...but what can you do when you're 16 
you know. 

 

Q: Tell me ...tell me  about your ch
ildhood. You had an unusual one. 
 

A: I was...I was a–We  were the fifth, fourth 
and fifth children of 
my mother. We had a 
wonderful, wonderful. All of them. Very happy fa mily life. Absolutely. In Bayreuth. My mother 

was absolutely . My father was mor e  of poet.   Very nice. And then when I went to Munch I fell 

for that because my father had taken the drawings
 of a child to a Profe
ssor  and he said, "Ah, 
she's very gifted. Why don't you send her?  So I 
had the first permission when I was 16. When 
they called me  back, I was too young and I could 
go again. But Munich was very important. But 
the second time , I was in Munch...I reme mber th
e first time feces on the wall  and Jews. That 
was the start of Hitler. And he...it was terrif
ying. But we didn't–crazy people. They thought it 
was crazy people, but it wasn't . And it went on. 
And then in my studio where I worked as a 
pupil...there was a young girl, beauti
ful girl and she came one day with a hack and cross, with a 
swastika. I said, "What are you going...ﬂ She said, 
"Oh, one of my boyfriends gave it to me .ﬂ I 
said, " You better don't wear it because the  has this
 hack and cross.ﬂ So for me  she kept it back, 
but then she wear it again, and 
that was the beginning. Hack and 
Cross. Swastika. All over. And 
it took away the joy. And then I 
got anonymous telephone 
calls. I should go to this place far out 
of Munich and these were the people I had refuse
d to meet and be friends
 with, and they took...  
 

A: Explain. I don't understand.

Q: Well, I...I got a telephone ca
ll for example, "Be at 9 O'clock at Corner, Munich at 9 
o'clock. And then telephone thing. 
I didn't go of course. And the next
 thing is I got a letter that 
my father died and I should go imme diately to Ba
yreuth. I knew also that wouldn't be true. This 
was the revenge of certain young punks because Irefused to walk and go out with them you 
know. So that it was the beginning that I knew I 
was...I was on the list you know. But...and I was 
on their list. But of course, I didn'
t bother.   knew that I ma rried 
and went to Holland and I forgot 
about. But I couldn't forget about, because I thi
nk I me ntioned that I ma rried in 1922 and in 23 
we visited Bayreuth. And in Beareth, there'
s a beautiful old Beareth opera house which got 
Wagner to Beareth.  offered him that house, 
but, of course, it was 
not big enough...to Doctor 
Wagner. But it was gorgeous...Beareth....and I loved 
it and I showed it to my husband and then 
down that opera...little opera hill came down a troop...a troop of singing boys with the old flag.  

and everything. And my husband had 
a terrible temper and he want
ed to go over and tear that 
flag down. But my father kept 
him back, said, "Don't. These  ar
e only stupid boys.ﬂ My husband 
was very prophetic. It wa s 1923. He said, "How can
 you say that? In 10 years these boys will be 
your judges, will be your teachers, will be your...
whatever it is.ﬂ And he was right. Te n years 
afterwards. 23 to 33. He knew it. He said it to my
 father.  But we knew and I knew it. Married to 

him, I mean I knew. He was polit
ically inclined, which he proved 
later too and I learned a lot of 
things and I got intere
sted in...in politics. 

 

Q: So in 1923? 

 

A: That was in 1923 when my husband said to my father, "In 10 years you will see those 

boys.ﬂ And that was right. They are your 
judges and they are the...that's it. Yeah. 
 

Q: Where did you go after Beareth?  Af
ter 1923, after that visit, tell us?   
 
A:I was...I was ma rried in Amsterdam. It 
was wonderful. The most
 ma rvelous life anybody 
could have. My children were born there. Lots of
 friends. It wa s a ma rvelous life there. And I 
could paint and I could draw. I di
dn't star t at  that time fi rst, but later I did. And it was just 
ma rvelous. I took to Holland like as if I was born 
there. And I felt I always talked the language 
without an accent. It was my...I forced myse
lf to listen you know. And nobody thought that I 
would not be born in Holland. That was wonderful
. I loved it. And then, of course, a tragedy 
came. And my husband knew it before hand. He 
said, "They come . They will come.ﬂ And I 
knew they will come .  
 

Q: Excuse me . I want to pause and stop the ta
pe  for a mo ment please. Okay, we are back on 
tape. Huh...You had a...you had starte
d to talk about the year 1933. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: During Amsterdam. Wh at happened in 1933. 

 

A: You know that was that terrible....the be
ginning in Germany. And of course, we were 
terribly not only touched 
but all the refuge comi ng and we tried very much to do for them, the 
ones who came and we...it was just a restless time.
 And my husband knew 
imme diately. He said, 
"This is the beginning.ﬂ And my mother said th
e same  thing. We knew it. And then I became  ill 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163

and had fever, and I was sent away for a fe
w months. And...uh...it was alright and I came back 
and it was very much better and then came 38. That 
was Kristallnacht. Wa sn't  it. And my mother 
was still in Beareth because she didn't  want to
 leave. She was very proud. She had no money in 
Holland. She had her money in Germany of course so she didn't want to leave. And the Gestapo 
came and the same night I went to Germany i
mmediately. I had my Dutch passport. I could do 
that. I went to Beareth and star
ted a fight of 7 days with the 
the , with these people because I 
wanted my mother out. And before they gave a 
exit reason that she coul d leave, they ha d of 
course a hundred thousand things 
to day. I was every day for 7 days there and fought with those 
people, and told them what I thought about th
em. I did! I told some body...one ma n that...one of 
the  that I know you. Your father was a fine 
ma n. He was really a noble ma n. I said, "Oh you 
seem so...and why do you ma ke a effort to besm
e a r my whole  fa mily?"  "Oh, no, we don't know. 
We don't .ﬂ But he did. But in any case, after 7 da
ys I got the permission to go to the bank and get 
my mother's  fortune go to the Nazis. The ba
nk director know me  as a little child. He said, 
"Listen, I know you, but it's bette
r that you go. Your mother couldn't come out. I'm sorry we 
have to take the money.ﬂ So they took my moth
er's whole fortune. That's why she didn't come  to 
Holland. I we nt to them opposite in that old palace
 which was once a palace and then was a Nazi 
place and got a visa for my mother to exit. But we say I didn't  get it, but it was there. And then I 

said, "Okay, I will go.ﬂ But when I came into
 the house...I forgot to tell you, my...the 
pictures...the pictures of my 
youth. You know, I had so ma ny. Th
e beautiful portraits of my 
ancestors, they were hacked to pieces in that
 Kristallnacht. My mother's  apartment looked 
unbelievable and the beautiful picture. I didn't mi
nd my picturers, my dr awings of my  youth but 
the picture of my beautiful grandmother.   And so
 I left and my mother followed in a few days. I 

purposely did that and when she came without tr
ouble. She could come
 over, but she left 
everything and came like that to Ams t erdam and 
I was...we were happy to have here. But the 
Kristallnacht was some thing which has to be tho
ught of you know. I was there. I saw it. I saw the 
destruction. It's sad. Terrible. I had a friend 
who came to me , not a Jewish friend, and she 
belonged to the aristocracy there and she said, 
"You know we  are so desperate.ﬂ Her father in 
law was a very high, you know, very religious. A
nd she said, "Believe me , we are not all like 
that. Believe me . We  think it's terrible.ﬂ But of
 course, they couldn't do anything. There were the 
Nazis and they have the power and in Beareth 
they had especially power because there was a 
teacher who helped Hitler before and the Wa gne
rs, of course. I didn't even talk about the 
Wagners yet. Huh?  Would you like to know about the Wa gners and my family?  Now my...I only 

reme mber that we always had singers comi ng and 
staying in my father's
 house who were singing 
for . With their little children, th
ey always talked about  and gr
andma, but it was  who was the 
power of course behind the throne
.  And I reme mber there was  in white and between  and the 

youngest daughter and her husband , he was the great
est anti-Se mite, the Englishman. So we saw 
them walk all the time. Beautiful old ladies,smiling, angelic, but the de
vil as we all know.  
 

Q: You saw them?  

 

A: Yes, of course we saw them. And my  fath
er knew Seigfrid and when I was graduating 
Seigfried gave me  per mi ssion to play the piano, 
his piano, in our...I know th
at when I left school 
I played  by Greek on the piano, on Seigfried Wagne
r's piano. Yeah, he was nice. It was she who 
was the bad one. But Seigfried was very nice. Wh
enever he saw me , he waved to me . You know 
that's...that's passe, of course. And so I left. My 
mother left and that was all about Germany and I 
didn't want to hear about Germany a nymore.

Q: So this happened in 1938.  

 

A: Yes, that was in 1938 and we settled her 
down and then, of course, ﬂŁwe knew what was 
comi ng. And then I got...I went to Switzerland. I worked in the....No it's very important. I had 

fever and the doctor said I must go away, get away
 from Amsterdam, from that fever place so to 
say and I went to Arosa.  And I me t a friend and he
 said, "Go to this hotel outside of Arosa. I was 
there and my husband left me  and on the first ev
ening I went down, consoled myself by putting 
on  a long gown, evening dress which I loved, and I'm called to the telephone. And my husband 

called me . I had just arrived you know, and he sai
d, "You have to come  back.ﬂ I said, "What?"  
"There is the invasion of Vienna
.ﬂ I think it was...not yet, I m
ean the Nazis went to Vienna. I 
forgot. In any case, I said, "I can't . I have 
high fever.ﬂ He said, "T
hen I'll call you tomorrow.ﬂ 
And I come  out and there stand two elegant Germans. They said, "Ah, . We observed you are so 

beautiful. Will you come  out? "   I sa
id, "I am not accustomed to go out with strangers.ﬂ They said 
you must speak a very educated ta
lk. I said, "Oh," I said, "You lis
tened?  "If you listened," I said, 
"then I tell you that I just hear
d that you invaded Austria.ﬂ "Tha
t couldn't be," he said. This 
gentleme n is the  of some paper. I said, "But it 
is true.ﬂ And I let them stand there. But I knew 
that I was on their list so I had 
letters. That was before Arosa.  
That was in . And I had bags...my 
husband wrote me  every day.  And I went to my ba
g to look for them in the bag. The letters had 

disappeared. So I knew...the chambermaids. They
'r e all German chambermaids. They had taken 
my letters, and the next day it was brought back. And 
so I said, "I cannot stay
 here in that hotel 
with those.ﬂ So I went down to th
e gentleme n and said, "I will not stay here in the hotel.ﬂ He 
said, "Why not? "   I said, "Your guests. I don't 
like your guests.ﬂ And I  wonderful chance. One 

of the skiers saw me  from Holland. He came. He 
said, "You know this lady is here in the hotel. 
Don't you know here? "   I said, "Y
es.ﬂ I called her up. I said I have got to get me  a room. That 
was the lady from Holland. She said, "I will.ﬂ 
So she got me  a room. I took a sleigh and left 
everything in the hotel and I knew I was on their 
list and that was true. That was the beginning. 
But they...but I was on the list. They had stolen 
my letters from my husband and so on. And that 
was now 39 I think. So that was...we knew we
 were... how could I say... not only my husband, 
but I was too on the list. And there it was. And then, you know, the invasion and we knew it. I 

said to my little housemaid when we went on va
cation for a fe w days in August. I said, "Stay 
here.ﬂ She said, "Why.ﬂ "I said, "Best. The Nazis 
come .ﬂ She said, "It couldn't be.ﬂ I said, Yes.ﬂ 
We were on vacation and after the second...on the 
second day the ma id come s in and while we 
were having dinner and said that
 three gentleme n are outside. They come  and then a screaming 
starts. My children never forgot it. There was 
these three Gestapo peopl
e there and two Dutch 
policeman and they wanted to have Mr. Model 
into prison. Yeah. And they screame d. That was 
the worse thing. And I went up to him. I was so
 furious. Said, "Why do you do that.ﬂ He said, 
"He's in our books 6 years.ﬂ "What for? "  "S
muggled dollars.ﬂ I said, "My husband smuggled 
dollars? "   "Yes, Ma'a m.  American Bank.ﬂ He didn't
 really do it.   So I immediately dumped into 
a train, left my children there, went to Amst
erdam and came to my house  and the ma id said, 

"You know, they were here with Mr. Model. They  opened every drawer and looked and left my 

in pieces and everything. They looked for papers 
and, of course, they couldn't find it, so that was 
the beginning of the prison. At th
e same  night at 11 o'clock at night, my maid come s...that little 
ma id...a very patriotic Dutch girl and she said, "T
here's a gentleme n...I had sent away...there's a 

gentlema n and he's one of those who was here 
with Mr. Model when he came with the Nazis," 
she said, "and he said he insists 
that he has to talk to you. I said, 
"Okay, if he insists. Put him in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163

your room.ﬂ  So I went there and it wa s one of 
the Dutch officers. You know I told you there 
were the Gestapo and then two Dutch officers. A
nd he said, "Please, Mrs. Model, trust me .ﬂ I 
said, "Why should I trust you?"  He said, "I am the 
other international law that we are forced to 
be with the Nazis when they do something with
 Dutch citizens you know.ﬂ And then he took out 
a little ma tch box and in that ma tchbox inside 
he had what he only 
could written. He had 
written...he had 9 people I should warn. And I warn
ed them of course. He said, "Please trust 
me .ﬂ I said, "But why should I trust you?"  He sa
id, "I tell you a stor
y. Last year...two years 
ago...I don't know...we had caught a young German w
ho came due, he said, who ca me  over with 
5 and the police called your husband because when they asked him, " What do you do with the– 

He said he delivered some thing to Mr. Model 
. Now he said...the policeman said latter...We 
knew Mr. Model had a perfect name . He wouldn't smuggle . So they called my husba nd. My 

husband said, "I can't  come . Come  t o me .ﬂ So
 they came. Three policeman with this young 
German Jew and my hus band said, "Do you know me
? "   "No.ﬂ My husband said, "I have never 
seen that boy.ﬂ But he said, "Let me  be alone wi
th him.ﬂ So the police left , went the other room. 
They were very polite and my ...my husband sa
id, "How did you get my name ? "   He said, "I 
bought it.ﬂ So he said, "What?"  "Yeah, there is an
 exchange in Berlin and your name  was on the 
highest list. I paid 800 ma rks for your name  as 
the one who helps everybo
dy.ﬂ I swear it this was 
the truth what I tell you. So he
 had my husband's name  and ga ve the police  knew he wasn't  
smuggling. So my husband said the police that th
ey should not put him back to German...send 
him back to Germany. And he vouched for him a
nd he gave him money that he could go in 
that...ﬂ which at that time was only a detention 
camp and not a...later became that terrible camp. 
So my husband got it done that that boy who got
 him into difficulties was not put back to 
Germany. And this was the policema n. He said, 
"And I was there when your husband pleaded 
not to put that boy back. And I said to myself if
 I ever can do some thing for that ma n will. And 
now was my  opportunity because when I came th
ere I knew I will help.ﬂ And he said, My 
colleague...colleague I don't know.ﬂ
 But the funniest thing is that
 next day in the afternoon, the 
colleague called me  and said, "Ah, he so wonderful.
 We got him something to eat in the morning 
before he went to the Gestapo 
headquarters.ﬂ Imagine. They'r e all heart that because they saw 
how wonderful he was. In prison...the prison...they
 said, "He's so wonderful...he had...he  gives 
courage to everybody. He said to them when they walked in the prison yard, he said, "Don't 

worry. They will not last out here. Then will not last 10 years," to the pe ople you know. That was 

him you know.  

 

Q: Before I ask you more about your husband, I'
d like you to put your purse on the floor. It's  
a little distracting. You s
hould try not to touch th
e mi ke up here. Okay?   
 

A: DidI?  

 

Q: Tell me  about your husband and how did he 
get involved in helping people. My husband 
as a young ma n already was involved. When he
 was 18, he was already a leader for young 
people. And when I me t him he had...was always
 in politics but agains
t everything....against the 
common ma n you know. So I knew that and I was happy and I became just like he was. I helped 

everybody as far as I could, but I wasn't  as powerful as he. Everybody could come  to him and 

they did. They did. I told you the Nazis told me
. They knew since  years that he was helping 
everybody and told me  themselves. And I said, "What did you say to me?"  Now isn't that stupid. 

I got so ma d. I was alone. He was ﬂKarloffŁ. Th
e name  of the Nazi hunter who took my husband 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163  
6 
 
was Inspector Karloff. Never will I forget the na
me. And he said, "I  think he's a wonderful man 
myself.ﬂ And I said, "And you keep him in prison ye
t? "  "But he's our enemy? "  I said, "What do 
you expect?"  You know he's too naive. Can you imagine?  And so they kept him and kept him 
and kept him.  And he could...he...
he didn't get my letters. I got hi
s letters which were desperate. 
He never got a letter and I wrote 
every day. I sent some body t o the 
prison. (Sigh)  He didn't...and 
they didn't give it to him. And he was tortured
 because there were bombings from the English at 
that time. But they were lost and then I get 
an anonymous telephone call from The Hague when 

he was about 4 weeks in prison. And he...there
 was a German speaking and said, "You don't 
know me  but I know about you and I know about your 
husband. I would like to see him.ﬂ I said, 
"He's not here.ﬂ "Where is he? "   I said, "In 
prison," and bang the telephone went down. I should 
not say in prison. He was in prison. And that was 
it. A week after that, the same  thing. "Can I 
talk to Mr. Model? "  I said, "He'
s in prison.ﬂ "Wait a mo ment," he
 said, "I come .ﬂ So there came 
a tall, nice, portly German who said, "I did not pu
t my car in front of your house, which was nice 

with the Gestapo of course. But I have to te
ll you that I am not your enemy. I'm your fri e nd 
because Mr. Model did some thing so fabulous on
ce for me . You know he always did things. I 
want to help him.ﬂ I said, "You only can help 
him when you get him out
 of prison.ﬂ And he 
disappeared, you know, and that was it. And then I 
didn't hear anything and then one day I get a 
telephone call Saturday morning and the same  voice sa
id, "I see clear. I talk
ed to that Karlo. And 
that was it. And then in the af
ternoon at 2 o'clock a taxi come
s and my husband was home. But 
that wasn't  the end of it. Every week one of th
e Gestapo people came to the bank and got him to 
The Hague or to Rotterdam, and he never told 
me  what happened there. He never told me . But 
every week twice, three time s, they 
called him again. Cat and mouse you know. H
  
 
 

Q: What was the excuse first for putting him in prison.  

 

A: Oh, he was the collector of 
the...of the dollars all over Europe
, which wasn't  true at all of 
course. It was...it was actually the...uh...you know...t
hen...yeah...then I wa s at the Gestapo for the 
eighth time. I never came...I always went to 
the Gestapo and he interrogated me , and on the 
eighth time, he said, "Something terrible has ha
ppened while I was away.ﬂ I said, "What has 
happened? "  He left...left the other man go and I 
was alone with him. And he said, "Some people 
have...I had forgotten about this even..."Some
 pe ople have offered money for Mr. Model's 
release.ﬂ I said, "What?"  "Do
llars," he said. I said, "We ha
ve no dollars. My husband has no 
dollars.ﬂ We  delivered it to the Dutch. We  
were supposed to deliver it. "No, no, no. 4 thousand 
dollars or 8 thousand dollars.ﬂ I don't reme mber. 
In any case, suddenly I
...he said...he me ntioned 
a name , Mrs. Levy. This Mrs. Levy, she was at my
 door, but I didn't receive her. He said, "Yes, 
but she was not Jewish.ﬂ She had the name ....she 
was a German who worked together with the 

Mexican Consul to get money out 
of the people. And he said...whe
n I was in prison...I forgot to 
tell you that me n ca me  in...a banker and said, "O
utside is a lady. She 
can help to get your 
husband out of prison." And i mme di
ately I knew. Impossible! I knew that wouldn't be possible. 
So I said, "I don't believe you.ﬂ "Oh," he said, "Y
es.ﬂ I said, "Oh, it cost
s money.ﬂ "Yes, it costs 
money, but what is money for the release of Mr
. Model? "  I said, "It's nothing, but for me  it's 
some thing because I don't  have any dollars.ﬂ "And 
anyway," I said, "I can't . "Who's the lady?"  
He said, "This is a Mrs. Levy."
 So I knew the name  you know. And whe n I was there he said, 
"Mrs. Levy came to hi m and offered the Gestapo.
..ima gine, he said, 4 thousand or 6...8 thousand 
dollars...I don't know...for the releas
e of . Of course, he couldn't do that. I said, "No, you couldn't 
do it, of course.ﬂ That was the beginning andI knew darn well that they had...they wanted...we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163

would have paid...they would have 
paid 4 thousand dollars and thenthey would have come  to us 
and give us 8 thousand dollars because that's wha t  they di d. But I didn't do it. I knew my husband 
would hate it, and he said later he wa s so glad fo
r that I didn't believe them and didn't let...I didn't 
see Mrs. Levy ever. But she interfered with my
 life because she wanted money. Later after the 
war, I heard, she was take n into pr ison by the Dutch with the Mexican Consul because she 

cheated and got money. I know people who paid 
her the money. But very nice people, Cohen, 
from Amsterdam. I heard that they paid the money. 
I didn't because first of all, I didn't  have it. 
Anyway, that was...that was the beginning you know. 
And then we get a telephone call from the 
American Consul, knew my husband, of course, my husband works for an American bank. And 

he said, "Mrs. Model, you have to get him out of
 the country.ﬂ I said, "D
on't I know that?  Don't I 
know that? "   And before the Nazi
s came , on the day before the Germans ma rched in...I forgot to 
tell you...I had in my living room about 13 people 
who all wanted to leave the country with my 
husband because they knew where he is there 
is action and they can do some thing. But my 
husband said, "I cannot leave. I have 40 people 
who depend on me .ﬂ But I will he lp you and we 
got in touch with other people. And there was a c
ousin of mi ne. He said, "I am a crimi nal but I 
don't go.ﬂ He said, "I cannot go if he doesn't  go.ﬂ 
I said, "I cannot go if he doesn't  go. I stay, of 

course.ﬂ It was...ah...I never can 
forget that afternoon and they were all there and the Belgium 
Consul even offered us that we could go, and he said he wouldn't go because some  40 people are 

depending on him. He cannot go. And he looked 
at me  and I said...funnily enough I had...he said 
to me later, "Why did you not sa
y anything.ﬂ I said, "I had a fee
ling we would get out anyway.ﬂ 
Real funny thing. I have a 
feeling we'll get out.  
 

Q: What did your husband mean '40 pe ople ar
e depending on him.ﬂ He had a bank and 40 
people were depending on him. He couldn't let th
em from one  day to the other without money, 
without anything. That wa s him. He s a id, "I canno
t.ﬂ My mother was one of them. You see. He 
said, "I couldn't do that. 40 people. I...I cannot go
.ﬂ And when he said that, I said, "We will go.ﬂ 
I...I had absolutely the feeling we will go some
where. We  could do it. It was my...it was not 
ma de up. I felt we could leave. And if so, he fi
nished everything and when the American Consul 
said try get out and then a few other people ca
lled and the Underground called us and we were 
twice put...it was the mo st awfu
l thing. Twice we were put on 
a list...an exit visa...visa, which 
was the mos t  important from the Nazis. But we
 couldn't no visa. We  had nothing. Let me  think 

back. Then that's another time when the....when th
e  was a friend there officially they gave the 

visa...we gave the permi t ...permit, but it was not th
e business of course. And  called me  and said 
we have another...we had another visa...exit 
visa...visa...exit for you. I said, "But we have 
no...have no visa for...from where should you go.ﬂ Bu
t then the American Consul said, "Mr. 
Model, try to get in touch with the American
 Consuls.ﬂ How it really happened, I don't  know. 
But the time  went and the exit visa wa s gone a
nd we get another call and they said, "If you don't 
leave now, you will never leave.ﬂ That's th
e Underground. So my husband again went to 
Rotterdam where the American Consul was, and he 
said to him, "It's desp
erate. I will be killed 
and we all will be  killed if you don't  give us 
the–"I can't  do it.ﬂ But...then my husband said, "I 
would...you would be responsible to
 Beareth because my hus band worked for the bank where 
Beareth was...something. He got a little frighten
ed and he said, "Okay. Let your wife come  on 
the...ﬂ And I came. And he...he took our notes, but 
this was it. But then in the meantime it was 
Friday and Sa turday morning my hus band went...on Monday, we were supposed to go to that 

transpor t. I had to tell my mother that  we leav
e. I had to pack two bags. And my sons had 40 
degree fever or some thing. Any case he said, "You  have to come  i mmediately.ﬂ He called me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163

fr om Rotterdam. I was not permitted to take a taxi  
but I di d, jumped into the trai n and arrive, and 
there he stands and he smiles a little bit. And he said, "I  think we will make it.ﬂ So he had told 
me  that while he was talking to the Consul he re
me mbered his other Spanish visa. He  went to the 
Spanish Consulate and there was one
 girl left. And she 
said, "I can't  do anyt
hing.ﬂ He said, "Here 
are...I don't know how much mone y he gave her
...Dutch mo ney. Please. To your favorite charity, 
but please put a Spanish visa and she did. She 
did. That was our savior...that unknown girl put a 
Spanish visa in our passport. And then he went ba
ck to the Americans Consulate and said to hi m, 
"Here, I have a Spanish visa.ﬂ Then, of course, I.
..I had to sign different 
things and at 3 O'clock 
on that Saturday afternoon, here come s out a ve
ry looking ma n. I forgot his name , thank God. He 
gave me  my  passport, gave me  his hand and 
said, "Here is your pass
port.ﬂ For you, I miss my 
golf. I swear it. That's what he says. And I sa
id, "But you saved our lives.ﬂ He said, "For you, I 
mi ssed my golf.ﬂ And then we went to Amsterdam 
and I had to tell my mother that we will leave 
and we didn't...and my sisters after me  died wh
en my husband was prison, and then I.... It was 

terrible, of course. You couldn't tell people, but
 I had to tell my moth
er and my brother.  
 

Q: You had to leave 
without your mother?   
 

A: Of course. We couldn't take her. And the
n. I must think back. Then that was Saturday. 
And on Sunday, my hus band went to see my mo ther
. He was so wonderful to her. And while he 
was gone, I get a telephone call from that ma
n with whom my husband worked Underground 
whom I knew very well. I mean my husband didn't
 tell me , but I knew. I knew the work of that 
friend of ours. And he said...it was 3 o'cl
ock in the afternoon, 
Sunday afternoon. Monday 
morning,  we had to be at 7 o'clock with our 
two bags on the Grand Ce
ntral Station. We would 
be smuggled into a transport. And that ...and he sa
id, "I'm sor r y. He has to be 8 o'clock...he has to 
go to Grand Central St ation. Don't as k any questi
ons he said. So when my  husband come  in, I 
said, "You have to be at 8 o'
clock at Grand Central Station. 
Di dn't know what...but he said, "I 
will be go.ﬂ So you can imagine, I died a thousan
d deaths you know when he went at 8 o'clock. 
He came ba ck at ll o'clock at night. And th
is is when he had to me morize the undersea port 
stations in  which the English bombed...the ones 
with the Nazis...when the Germans wanted him 
to bomb. And this was the list from  t hat was 
the head of the Underg
round in The Hague who 
had a blueprint and said my husband has to me mo
rize that bl ueprint where  where the U-boats 
are really built. And that he had to do. He had 
to me morize. You can imagine. In 2 hours! And 
then the me n from The Hague, who was the he
ad of The Ha gue put...put his paper again and 
said, "Good luck," and left with 
the blueprints and they were in my husba nd's mi nd. He didn't tell 
me  what he had done, of course. I heard it only 
then in...in Spain because he was so desperate 
that he could lose the memory of that. Imagine, 
in  they will be delivered–But he said the ma n 
from The Hague said, "We waited for you. We  had 
to have some body with me mory and brains.ﬂ 
So that...so that was the last th
ing, and then the next morning we  went to the station. It was 
horrible. My mother was standing 
in a corner. My brother was sta
nding in a corner, and then we 
went into a train. That is it.
 And that was goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye
. It was horrible. And then 
we went the train. Halfway on the way to Brusse
ls the door opens and out come s a very tall, 
good-looking German officer. I think his name  
was Mr. ﬂVon Hagen, Colonel von HagenŁ or 
some thing. He bowed to me  and he said, "Mrs. 
Model, I have to borrow your husband.ﬂ And he 
was a German officer. He said, "Don't be afraid. 
I would like to talk to him.ﬂ My husband had to 
go. I was sitting in that train. My children got fr
ightened. You can't  imagi ne how awful that was. 

After 20 mi nutes, he came again and that was the 
ma n who had just heard the name  Model. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163

had heard about my husband, and he always want
ed to know whether we are a family of a 
German General from Model. And my husband sa
id...I am not s family...we knew who we were, 
of course... I am not, and now and please let me
 go back to my wife. She will di e a thousand 
deaths because she went through quite a lot. So he
 said, "Mr. Model, I only wanted to say you we 
heard so mu ch about you and I am glad I met 
you," and he let him go. Now that same  Mayor or 
whatever he was kept his hand about
 me because I had a little bask
et. The kids called it  because 
it was a little basket which we had from our boat in
to which I put three litt
le  on this side. The 
books I had  from my husband, and a few drawings
 I had ma de of my husband and my mother 
and a friend. There were in that little basket 
which the kids called  you 
know because I carried it 
myself. So wherever we  stopped in
 Paris...in...first in Brussels...in 
Paris and we had to go out and 
walk a little bit, this Gesta
po ma n who was with that .... with that German officer came  over to 
me  and said, "Open that basket.ﬂ And every time  
he said it, that officer came  said, "Leave her 
alone.ﬂ That went on four times. Four times he
 kept his hand over me . He  said, "Leave her 
alone.ﬂ But in  when he said goodbye, he cam
e over. He said, "I kept my hand...hand over you 
Mrs. Model. What is in that basket? "  I sai
d, "You could have opened it. There are books, . But I 
didn't...I was glad he di dn't , because when we opened on the boat these books because friends 
wanted to see it again, out fall drawings which 
a friend from Paris had ma de about Hitler and 
poems. I ma gine that! That was my luck that he 
didn't force me  to open that...that basket. That 
was a wonderful ma n. I wish I had...I could than
k him. Yeah. So then we were in Lisbon...in 
Madrid. In Madrid, you know we could only me t 
because.... Yeah, I forgot. When we arrive d in 
Sandebastian, we were led to a hotel, and ha
rdly had we entered that hotel when a young 
Dutchman c o me  over and said, "Mr. Model, the 
Embassy from Madrid has already called three 
times. You have to call back. They have to 
talk to you imme diately.ﬂ
 So my husband called 
back. It was the Embassy, and the Ambassador sa
id, "I was told that 
you bring news. Please, 
tomorrow, you...you come  to Madrid.ﬂ My husband 
said, "I cannot do that. I cannot just leave 
her.  I have no visa. They knew th
at we had to. "But you will get 
it.ﬂ So next day came the Dutch 
Consul from Optowa. I'll never forget it. They
'r e lovely old people there who had no visa. Of 
course, my husband said you have to get them a 
visa to Spain too. And he came , and it took 4 
days until we got permission from the...from th
e Spanish ﬂthingŁ to travel through Spain to 
Madrid. And then we were in Lubrick, and he dump
ed us in the , and he said, "You sit here. If I 
come  back after 2 hours,"...He ha
d a funny feeling...I couldn't get
...get rid of my knowledge. "If 
I'm stay a longer it's fine, but you have patience,
 and he dumped us in . The kids run around the  
of course, and I was sitting at  with these ot
her people also. And he 
came after 2 hours, looked 
terrible and said, "I couldn't talk to him.ﬂ When I enter he came  over to me , "Ah how wonderful 

the ... He said, "Ah, you know that I play golf wi
th the German ambassador all the time . He 's 
such a nice ma n.ﬂ When my husba
nd heard that, he said, "For God'
s sake," so he didn't tell them 
about the , but he had knowledge of a few other 
things and he told them that. And the officer 
said, "Yes, but have told that bring out the mo
st important news about
 Underground. No? "   Max 
said, "That must have been an 
error," you know. And he came to me
 and he said, "My God, if the 
ma n is Lisbon is the same  caliber, I have to call America with my knowl e dge and then it's too 

late. But the ma n in Lisbon was wonderful. My 
husband spend the whole week with  who was 
the Under Secretary and when we were on the 
boat he heard on the radio then...on the ship's  
radio...that the Dutch replaced  and the  from
  became the Ambassador. That was...he never 
knew....that baron never knew that 
it was the little Jew from Amsterda m who cost him his post. 
Yeah?  Isn't that?  The...the turn of events is
 just mi raculous in 
a way, you know?  It's  just...you 
can't  believe it some time s. Yeah. And then we la
nded in Lisbon. It was nice to be there. You 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163

could breathe again. The kids liked it, and he worked with the Embassy every day. Yeah. And 
then friends...they learned the boat wa s , whic
h was a boat for 150 people where there were 500 
on the boat, you know, all refugees. 
All refugees, of course, some  
spies too. We  were five in a 
cabin. We  paid three thousand dollars which was sent from America. My sister-in-law sent the 

money for the boat to pay for. We  paid. Some  
didn't you know. There was a whole bottom of the 
boat was full with...with...uh...young immi grants fromall over and they, of course...they didn't 

pay a penny, but we were...we could pay so ther
efore we pay. Huh?  And there was guy ﬂŁon the 
boat behaved very badly. His wife at least. He 
didn't. And the Rabbi from Luxe mbourg, we were 
elite there, we were first class because we 
paid. But this couple who had money with no 
refugees, the son-in-law of the conductor, , and 
lovely wife and son and I think  and then, of 
course, it spoke around immediatel
y that my husband does bring  from th e bottom of the bunk, 
and a Dutchman. Everyday the kids...he organize
d those kids so they put the food which were 
above the table and put them 
down because they didn't get 
any food you know. The people down 
there was organized. Every day the ki
ds went down and...and did that.  
 

Q: Your husband told them to do that?   

 

A: Yeah. We  got more...we  got food...more food, 
but our food too to divide too. But then 
one day that young ma n came, that Dutchman came and said a baby was born. And it's terrible 

amongst these ma ny people. It's terrible...the wi
fe ...the young wife of a young Russian or Polish 
violinist...I cannot forget it. "We must have a 
room. We  must have a 
room.ﬂ So my husband 
started and we go to  because they ha d a living room on the boat. They ha d a saloon on the boat. 

He said, Mr. , you have to give up your saloon. Sh
e said, "I can't.ﬂ He said, "Why can't  you? "  "I 
have to receive people.ﬂ My husband said, "W
hom do you receive?  I won't come  anyway.ﬂ Do 
you receive the Rabbi of Luxembour g, and Mr. andMrs. something on the ?"  No, she couldn't 

give her room. So that was number one. Then, he 
went to the Luxembour g Ra
bbi and he  said, "I 
can't  give it this room. A friend of my wife is 
living there.ﬂ Then he we
nt...of course, the people 
who had no living room and wanted 
out of first class...our friends wa
nted to give their bathroom, 
everything. But you couldn't then. Then the purser came to my husband who had observed my 

husband of course, and said, "You know, Mr. Model.
 I gi ve him...give them my room because I 
saw how tough it is.ﬂ So that young of wife then cam
e to the purser's room. I give you these little 
sketches. Everything is the purest tr
uth what I tell you, not that I want
 to make up, but it's true. It 
is true. So that young baby was looke
d after in the purser's room on t
op of the ship and not in the 
bottom of the ship. Yeah. So that was....I was so ha ppy when  was permitted in the radi o room 

than  the  room of ﬂSandamŁ. 
And  Madrid was replaced by that
 one  he had ma de. So he was 
very happy and he became ....ﬂ   Ł be came the Am
bassador. No?  That's  a
nother story. Huh?   
 

Q: On the ship can you...On the ship can 
you tell us about Shigall himself.   
 

A: No, I mean...I he was...he had nothing to
 say. Bella was everything you know. Bella was 
the ruler and she...she was standing on the bottom on the...on the rung. I wa s sick. I wasn't  up 

very much. She said, "My daughter, my daughter, 
My daughter.ﬂ "What 
about your daughter?"  
"Eva is still in Paris.ﬂ Of course, Eva is a very nice person. I later me t her. I helped her when she 

was in New York. Very nice woma n.  And she was 
ma rried at that time and couldn't get, but she 
came out and that was he r whole complaint. Only
 that Eva come s out. But he didn't say much I 
mean. She r un around with a book on her back so my husband said, "Why do you run around 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163  
11 
 
with that book?"  Do you think some  people 
can buy....ﬂ You know he was...he had a...he had, 
but Bella, Be lla and later we saw them in Ne
w York a few time s and he was always very 
apologetic you know, and I liked me eting him. 
The daughter came and I liked her very much. 
She was a few times in my house and her husband was selling.  Bags full of sketch, not sketch, 

but were etchings and she went 
from rich people to rich. So
metime she came to me to have 
lunch. She's a wonderful daughter, and she sewedfor him the m at that time. You can imagine 

later it was different by that 
time. Just had to get money. He
 was brought over by the Cultural 
Mission or some thing but they...of course they pa
id for his apartment I'm s ure but...so she sold 

these books which she got. She's a wonderful dau
ghter. Really. Really wonderful. He was a–He 
couldn't say anything. He  was rude by here. And 
then one day I see him in the street and he 
cried. She had died, and he was desperate. Then
 shortly afterwards he
 fell in with a young 
English girl. It wasn't  so terrible you know. Bu
t he was a nice ma n. He wa s just a weak ma n you 
know. I had nothing against him. And Eva was w
onderful. I saw her later when she married . 
Very nice. Had two boys, so she was very very ni
ce woma n. Eda. She was very rich, but she also 
gives. She was not like her father was, stingy. Sh
e gives. She gives pictures here and there. I 
admi re her very much. Very nice, very nice. 

 

Q: So you were...back on the boat. Are there other stories about the boat trip that you would 

like to tell? 

 

A: Oh, yes. One day I was bed. I had high feve
r, and I heard singing and I we nt down. There 
were a few Viennese young boys with ﬂLeaderŁ a
nd I went up to one and I said, "Aren't you 
ashame d?  You sing a song of Vienna. There your 
grandfather cleaning thei
r streets.ﬂ He looked 
at me . He said, "So I sang But two young girls ca
me  down and said, "Oh excuse us because it 
was so rude and stupid of that man and I was pe
rfectly ri ght and she will see that  I don't  sing 

any–That's what he sang all the time with his 
guitar. So that was another thing, but he didn't 
sing it anymore. Yeah. About...about...because you 
asked me  about the boat. Yeah. Otherwise, 
the kids had a lovely time and somebody tried to 
teach them the...the national anthem and they 
had a good time  and my son, my older son, who ha
d so much tears when his father wa s in...in 
prison and later in Paris when he had to go away. 
He cried and cried but then he come s to me  and 

there was my old, smiling lovely boy who was hi
s old self. He had...it was a mi racle. There 

was...his father was there. He didn't have to be 
afraid that they come  and take his father.  
 

Q: Let's back up. Excuse me. Explain about comi ng into New York. 

 

A: Yeah. I forgot. I have to 
tell you that of course. We la
nded in Staten Island, and there 
were...my si ster in law and some  friends, and he 
had taken an apartment in Fifth Avenue so we 
could go there and the kids started imme diatel
y to...it's wonderful for 
them. You know, the high 
skyscrapers and everything. They loved it. And, 
of course, it was terrib
ly hot but nothing was 
bad. It was so wonderful to be in America you 
know. That was it. My husband got imme diately a 
job, and that was also wonderful and so we stay ed for a few week and a month in that Fifth 

Avenue apartment and then I looked around and found....and then we had to go up Riverside 

Drive at night to see some body who asked him to 
see...I don't know who it was...and we stepped 
out of Riverside Drive on Seventy Second street, 
and I look around and I said, "It's lovely here.ﬂ 
And I see...on the other side, I se
e some thing that looked like an 
apartment to...rent. I went over 
and this was the apar tment I rent ed. Just like that
. First one, and I rented it the next day. That 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163  
12 
 
was...yeah...and I'm still there. Yeah. Now asked me  
some questions. I talk and talk because but 
please. 
 

Q: Yeah. What is it like
...uh...for you...uh...a young artist young ar
tist with a husband and 
children fi rst seei ng the United Stat es?  

 

A: Well, as an artist, I me a n
 I thought nothing but these two l
ittle things, but I wanted my 
children to get out of New York. I wanted themt o learn English without 
an accent because I had 
seen in Holland when the children lived with thei r 
parents, they had an ac
cent. They learned it. 
But then a fri end of ours...I said I have to get them in a school outside of New York until a fr iend 

of ours she got us the addresses. And one af
ternoon when the kids...I put them in a camp....you 
know we had friends who had told us about a cam
p, so the kids were in a camp already after a 
week. Just gave me  tips you know. There...You ha
ve to have a friend, you know–was one of 
them then you know, and I went then...we got a 
telephone call. A young ma n ca me  a nd said and 
said we should come  out on Sunday. And I said, 
"We will do that of course.ﬂ And it was very 
chancy little ma n. He wa s–He was sent....I said, 
"Yeah. Sent to look us over.ﬂ He said, Yes.ﬂ 
And he stumbled over a table 
where some  photographs...the only
 thing I could take were 
photographs and the photograph fell
 down. He said, "Who di d that?" 
 I said, "I did.ﬂ He said, 
"Oh, Mrs. Model, your children are in because our 
chairma n ﬂŁis one of the big publishers and he  
loved children of artists. So it was. I came ther
e and they immediately got accepted. Of course, 
my older one imme diately was...in spite of he di
dn't know English he was in short time on top of 
his class. It's  just fabulous. Peter always was 
was very intelligent, but
 immediately on top and 
loved and adored by the others. And ﬂ was...he's  like that. So that was from the beginning and I 

had a wonderful time in the boardi
ng school outside of New York.   
 

Q: What was the adjustme nt like for you
 and your husband in the first year.  
 

A: We got a scholarship, by the way. That's
 what I wanted to tell you. I was adjusted 
imme diately. I didn't have any trouble whatsoever. 
I felt at home. I spoke 
English, of course, and 
my husband spoke English and we were imme diat
ely...we...we imme diately felt that's where we 
wanted to be. We  had some  American friends 
and that was wonderful. And it was no trouble. I 
mean I...just wonderful, so we took–And that's 
it. I can't  say anything 
but perfect results.  
 

Q: What work did your husband do? 

 

A: My husband was in the banking brokering bus
iness. But he had a...was a specialist. He 
was something very special also in that because
 after his work and somebody come to me in 
America and said, "You know I ma
de a study of your husband's brain and I saw there were only 
18 people in America who could do what he did," 
but I never knew what he did. So that was a 
little exaggerated, but it was su
rely truth. And he could work
 immediately, and it was very 
important. And people were awfully nice, Ameri
cans...the Americans we knew, but for one.  
 

Q: Turn back. When you talked that the FB
I had called your husband at some  point. Could 
you explain about that? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0163  
13 
 
A: Yes. That was very strange. He gets a te
lephone call. I must not forget to say some thing. 
When we were in St aten Island and that immi gra
tion officer interrogated us didn't want to let us 
in because  we had no hotel. We  had only , whic
h was address of my husband's office business. 
And he said nobody lives on .   My husband said, 
"I know. My fa mily and my friends are down 
there. They will tell us where we 
live. I can't  lie to you," he said. 
"I can't  tell you I live in that 
hotel where we were before, but I have no address.
 This is business.ﬂ And he was very nice. But 
then finally my husband took out 
his Dutch career papers and he
 said, "Why didn't you tell me  
before? "   He said, "I didn't  need to. I have a pe
rfectly valid passport with a perfectly valid vi sa," 
which was true. And he didn't want to do it, but
 then he had to do it.
 And so that was the 
reception. And then we were boat...the boat left us to Manhattan skyline and we saw it was 
beautiful, Staten Island. Not Ellis 
Island. It was Staten Island. Yea
h. It was beautiful . We  were at 
home . The kids were at home
 immediately. There is no doubt
.  My youngest son said to 
me ...a fter a week, he said to me , "Mamma, can you 
believe...if I tell my friends in Holland that I 
am accustomed to skyscrapers, they wouldn't believe
 it.ﬂ I'll never can forget he said that. It's 
true.  

 

Q: Tell me  about the FBI.  

 

A: Oh, yes, so the FBI knew of course then 
through this immi gration thing that he was a 
Dutch career you see. So they approached him and sa
id they trust him. Could they use him to be 
their...when they need...when they need some thi
ng to know about Holland and all that.ﬂ So that 
was when they called him, very often. And about people whom they had, you know...and my 

husband, of course, never said anything negative a
bout the people. Then, afterall, we didn't know 
them. We  only know one friend and we said he's a very rick and wonderful ma n. But this is way 

asked.  He never told me  really what they asked hi
m, but he went constantly. In the first year, he 
was constantly called to help them because th
ey trusted him. He was a Dutch career. They 
believed. And they saw the papers you know. So that was very good, of course. And I...when we 

suddenly became citizen, he was...you know I talk a lo
t, and then he said But my husband always 
warned her, "Mina, you get yourself in deep wate
r. Don't do that." Mr. Roosevelt was in there 
too, but he was a leftist organi
zation. Don't forget you must te
ll these interrogation officers for 
the citizenship, you must tell them that you were 
a me mber of these things. He was so asked me , 
"Did you belong to any organizations.ﬂ
 "Yes," I said, I belonged to 
that but I left after 2 years. 
That was true. They knew everything. And he kne
w that. Through the FBI, he knew. They would 
ask everything. So I was safe. I wouldn't have t
hought about it, that I was a me mber once. But 
that was the truth and I was so happy. And they 
were very nice because I was not a member any 
more. All these little 
things come  ba ck now when you ask it you know. 
 

Q: Is there anything else you woul
d like to add to your story?  
 

A: Tothat? 

 

Q: To any of it. 

 

A: I don't know what you want to know a
bout...about my...my life. Didn't you say...

Q: Anything. Yes...What...what I'm interested in 
is are there...is thereany more stories that 
you want to tell about the Nazis 
and your involveme nt with them.  
 

A: I really don't...I don't want to reme mber so 
much about that now. We  wer e  free of them 
and, of course, I left my fa mily and all of them. That was tragic and terrible.  

 

Q: How did you lose your mother?   

 

A: In the conc entration camp. She was there. 
And my brother was sent away and the kids 
were sent away. This is my book 
then, in this book. It was terrify
ing. It was terrible, of course, 
and my husband's sister died in–That was 
the other thing, and..uh...after the war....ah...you 
know, it's really...we should...we started a new life, 
and we were very happy here. The kids were 
happy here. My husband was happy here too. It's onl
y terribly that I had to lose him so early.  
But otherwise, it was a wonderful life. We  had 
nice friends, and I had my...my work. You asked 
me  about my work.  

 

Q: Please describe for us. 

 

A: We had a wonderful...I had 
imme di ately nice friends. I became a me mbe r  of the wome n's 
association, and I exhibited there an I got a gold 
me dal. I told you that. And I could work and I 
had a one-man show, which was very nicely then
. I had...they were very good to me . I me an I 
was really...they liked what I did let's say. 
And...uh...I was happy. That's it. America was good to 
us and is good to us. So what more do you want? 

 

Q: Can you think of anything else?  Thank you very much. 

 
A: Is that really what you wanted to know?   
 

Q: Oh, yes. Oh yes.  

 

A: I...I...I was so afraid I would not be 
able to tell what you wanted to know. 
 

Q: You are ma rvelous. You ar
e absolutely ma rvelous.  

 

A: I talk. I talk. 

 

Q: Ah, but the way you talk.
