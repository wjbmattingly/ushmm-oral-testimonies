ye
ars bef ore Hitlerannexed Austriaand Czechoslovakia in 1938 and, of  course,I know you  
were so young, so you really are recounting what you've learnedf rom  yourfam ily andothers.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Right. W ell, inm y book there is a photo of m
y sister and m e at 
thebeach. W e went to north of  France,facing England. Andall I know is that the water was 
so cold.  It wasf reezing.  I was af raid of the sea. But otherwise all I know is f rom m y parents 
who kept a journalf or m y sister and me and later onf orm y brother. She wrote regularly in the 
journal. Otherwise I have no recollectionuntilW orldW ar II. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwere your parents' nationalities?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My father wasDutch. They had been Dutchfor centuries
.   M y 
father cam ef rom a town called Angouleme. On the Perm anent Exhibition on the wall there is 

the town with all the Jews that were m urdered.  So he was Dutch.  He never became 
naturalized French.  
 
 
I was born
 
--
 
I was born in Paris.  So was my sister.
  
And Ithought Iwas French, but 
actually the French governm entdidn't accept us as Frenchuntil 1947.  Something If oundout 
ju st re ce ntly.  
 
 
Andm y m other wasf rom  Hamburg, Germany.  T hey had been theref or centuries as 
well.  I'm  not sure if  you're going to see thatphoto, butm y grandm other and great 

grandm other, and great
,  
great grandm other,were from Hamburg as well.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How large was your extendedf am ily? 
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  It was large onm y f ather's side,noton m y mother's side who 
was an only child.  My father, yes.  And som ething that m y niece, Jessica, m y brother's 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

daughter,f ound out in great detail is that we have over 200m embers of  m y Dutchf am ily that 
were m urdered.
 
>> Bill Benson:  200 that were m urdered. W hat was your f ather'sbusiness during those earl y 

years of  your lif e? 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My father came toParis in1926.  Hewas 21 years old.  A high 

schoolf riendof  his in Holland, in Am sterdam, toldhim that there was anopening.  My f ather 
had d
one some training in a bank, so he joined hisf riend in hisbusiness.  He was nota 
m erchant, he was a businessman im porting and exportingf ood, specialty foods,usually.  
Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And do you know what their lif e was like in those years before the war? W as 

it a comf ortable life?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  It was a m iddle class Jewish fam ily, in the suburbs justonthe 
edge of Paris,on the southeast.  Very close to the zoo.  I remember I loved going to the zoo
, 
w
hich, of course, with the war I was not allowed.  I loved the m onkeys especially.  T hat I 
r e m em be r .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter Hitler annexedAustriaand Czechoslovakia, your parents left Paris with 
you and your sister for a short time.  T ell us what you can about that and about the eve
nts that 
occurredbef ore the war actually began with Germ any's invasion of  Poland in September
 
193 9 .  
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Every tim e there was a danger, and especially with the 

declaration of war, Germ any invaded Poland,m y parents lef t with us, l
ef t  Pa ris .   A c tu a lly,  we  
left Paris I think three tim esbefore thef inal leaving.

W hen Germ any invaded Poland, because France andEngland hadan alliance with 
Poland
 
they were obligated to, by thetreaties, to invade Poland.  But nothing happened.  And 
t
hat's what was called in English the phony war, phony,f unny, and in French if anybody 
speaks French, [Speaking French]
, 
the funny war. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was theperiod between whenGermany invaded Poland and the 
Low 
Countries
 
were invaded in May.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hat was later,in 39.  And there was an alliance between 
Germ any andtheSoviet Union. T hey divided Poland. It was already pretty horrible for the 
Jews there.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heycalled it thefunny or phony war because nothing was really happening.  

Righ t ?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Right. T he French soldiers were m obilized but nothing was 

happening.
  
Som y parents left and then came back.  But then Hitler was not satisf ied and 
decided to invade, in 1940
, 
Luxemburg.  If you see am ap of Europe, Luxemburg, Belgium , 
Ho lla n d
, t
hose countries were supposedly neutral.  And then France
 i
n June
 
1940.  Andthat 
was the big exodus. W eleft.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we com e to thebig exodus when you lef tforthatthird tim e, in 
J u l y of  
1939, Ithink your grandfather died in Holland.  Yourf ather was notable to attend hisfuneral, if  
I recall. W hy was that?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  No.  He was able, but he went alone.T here was a big 
depression inAmerica.  There was abig depression,econom ic depression, in France, too. 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

And I suppose it was because there was really not enoughm oney for thefour of usto go.So 
m y f ather wentalone.  And in m y journal it says how sad he was,f irst of all because hisf ather 
died
 
--
 h
i s  nam e
 
was Em manuel 
Mandels 
--
 b
ut also because the rest of  thefam ily couldn't join 
him . So collecting that f rom the journal and in m y bookI say it was a blessing thatm y 

grandfather died because he didn'thave to suff er what happenedto his wif e,m y grandm ot
her, 
who was m urdered. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedthat you ended up leaving Paris about three tim es.  And,of 
course, the last tim eduring the exodus. W e'll talk about that inamom ent. Do you know wh y 
your parents, like af terwar broke out in Septe
m ber
 
1939, why they lef t Paris but would return?  
W hy would they return?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Becausem y father had tom ake a living.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Go back to his job.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And once Germ any invaded 
the 
Low Countries
 
and invaded France in 
Ma y
 
1940, full
-
blown war is on in France atthat point. So youand yourf am ily joined literally 
m illions of French and Parisians particularly i n exiting Paris andheading south.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> 
Bill Benson: W hatdo 
you 
r em em be r  of  tha t ?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  I remember that I hadm y doll.  Andmy sister had her doll. I 
know f rom  the journal thatmy father had histypewriter andm y m other had her sewing 
m achine. Andm y parents wrote inmy journal, well, with those two instrumentsof  work, we 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

can always m akea livi ng som ewhere. 
 
 
Som y f ather was ableto get a little vanf rom his business. W e were very lucky that 
we drove I don't know how m any hours, enough gasoline.  But there is another survi vor, who is 
French
 
--
 
I don't know if he's in the audience today.  He just told me the otherday that he was 
in the exodus
 
--
 h
e's about two years younger thanI am
 
--
 a
nd that his whole f am ily was 
bombed andhe lost a large part of hisfam ily. W e were not hit by bom bs. One of them any, 
m any m iracles.
 
 
My f atherm ust have taken little side roads. And then it was evening.  He knocked at 
thedoor. Said could we spendthe night. And thosepeople were so wonderf ul.  And they 
gave us their dining room and another room ,and we ended up spending three weeks there.  
And then we went back to Paris. W hy? Becausem y father said
 
--
 
well, they had just closed 
thedoorof  theapartment in Paris andm y father said, 
ﬁ
I have tom ake a living.
ﬂ  
 
  
And on the way
 
back, m y father saw the northern part of France was occupied,of  
course. That was theArm istice between Hitler
 
and Petain.  Andm y father wrote in m y journal 
or in an interview later on thathe saw a contingent of Senegal
en
 
soldiers being beaten by 
G e rm a
n soldiers.  Andm y f ather wrote that ithad given him thef ull tasteof  what was going to 
happen to us.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Seeing the Germ ans beating the 
Senegalen soldiers.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atone point I think your parents considered leaving for a Dutch colony but 

they didn'tdo so. W hy was that? 
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  By the time they m adeup theirm ind, it was
 
--
 
what was the other 
colony? W ell, men were notallowed to leave France. My f ather at that time said
, "
W
e are 
either going to live togetheror dietogether."
 
>> Bill Benson:  So hekepteverybody together.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  But another thing.  I have that inm y book; that myf ather wrote to 
his cousin who had moved to Palestine atthat tim e
; t
hat he was going to join the Dutchf ree 
f o rc
es inEngland.  Hewrote tohis cousin ona postcard, which Ihave, saying
 
--
 
and I don't 
know what Ellen, m y mother, is going to do wi th the two little girls.  But he f elt it was his duty.  
And then he couldn'tbecause with the war he couldn't get out. Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So once the Germ ans attacked Paris
 
--
 
I think youand your sisteractually 
rem em ber som eof  that.  Ithink you rem em ber going down into shelters.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Oh, yes.  Andthe Germ ans were there, too, right next to us. And 

m y f ather
 
--
 
said, " D
on't be af raid
 
--
 i
t 's like  a  st o rm .   
ﬁ
Don't be af raid of  that big noise."  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Describe for us a little bit sowe all understand what Vichy, France, was. W hat 

that dem a
rcation linem eant so that when youf led Paris andheaded towards Vichy, France
, 
what did thatactually m ean? 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W ell,f rom  theJews it m eant that wewere not allowed to cross 

again the north
 
--
 
the occupied zone where the Germ ans were inf ull force andthe south which 
I always sa y was the so
-
called unoccupied zone or the so
-
calledf ree zone, settled in Vichy, 
which is a lovel y town but that's wherethe governm ent
 
--
 
thef ree France government was.  
Th
e re
 
were not exactly strict m easuresagainst the Jews yet.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

12
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yet. 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  So thatArm istice was signed.  It didn't last very long.  Butfor the 
m om ent, that's where it was.  But Jews were notallowed to crossthe dem arcation line.  You 
needed a vis
a.  Jews, of  course, were not allowed to get
 
--
 
we were  notallowed to live, period
, 
a
nd certainly notto get a perm it to leave Paris and that area and go into the so
-
called f ree 
zone.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would rem ain in Paris until, I believe, the summer
 
of  19 42 .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's when your parents arrangedfor thef our of you to leave Paris for Vichy, 

France. Tell us what the events were, to theextent you know, that led up to their decisionin 
J u ly
 
1942 that we now really have to leave Paris.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My parents'f riends kepton telling them
 
--
 
f irst the y to ld  m y 
parents
 w
hy don't you get baptized and becom e Catholic, which was totally irrelevant because 
m y parents, grandparents, great
 
--
 
every
body was Jewish.  T hat was senseless.  
 
 
W hat it was is there were measures against the Jews right af ter 1940, right in 1940 
when theGermans were in Paris.
  
Firstof  all,Jews are to register as Jews
 
at
 
t h e Cit y Ha ll.   
Andm any years af ter the war France 
said:  W hy did 
you 
register? Andm y father said
 w
e're 
going to obey the law and they're going to leave us alone. So wewere f ully registered. My 

parents didn't have false paper on their I.D. card that everybody had to have. T here was abig 
stamp in
 
ca p
ita l le tte rs
, i
n red saying " J
EW S
."
 
>> Bill Benson:  " J
EW S
"  stamped on the I.D. card.

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  And there was a lotof  police. The French police was 
cooperating very nicely with the Germ ans. T hey could askfor your papers. If m y fathe
r o r 
m other had given papers, that would have been theend of us. W echildren didn'thave I.D. 
cards.  I guess we wer e too young.  But we couldn't go tothe zoo. W ecouldn't go to the park.  
W ecouldn't rideour bikes.  My sister startedto take swim m ing
 
lessons
;  
she couldn't. All kinds 
of  m easures.  
 

 
Paris hasthose littleparks called square. T he Jews could only go shopping at the 
endof  theday when there was nofood lef tbecauseall thef ood
 
--
 
Idon't know if  you know that 
all thefood was sentto
 
Germany
 f
or the soldiers,f or the families
; h
usbands or children or sons 
orf athers were in the war
.  S
o there was ver y little f ood right in thebeginning.  But the 
m erchants in ourneighborhood knew m y parents.  From 5:00
 
t o 7 : 00
 
m y parents were allowed 
to go. There was always a little food lef tf or us.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywould save a littlef or you.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah.  And in the school they gave us powderedm ilk.  It tasted 

terrible.  I can still taste it.  Andat recess, we hadtodrink it. So I had todrink it. SoI drank it.  
It wa s fo o d.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely. W hathappened to yourf ather's business? 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Oh. That wasanother law. T hat Jews were not allowed
 
--
 
they 
were not allowed to be doctors
, to be dentists, to be working f or the governm ent
 
--
 
what you
 
call in Am erica federal em ployees
 
--
 a
nd then in 1941, businessmen.
 
 
Som y f atherhad to give up his business
; i
nother words, no income.  His associate 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

was a ver y nice m an. And m y father used
 
to  g o
 
--
 
I believe he wentby bicycle.  Although he 
was not allowed touse a bicycle, but taking the Metro was very dangerous.  Jews were in the 
last car in the Metro.  And thepolice could com e atany time.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And just round people up.
 
>> J
acqueline Mendels Birn:  Right.  And whenever there was a ring of the bell
 
--
 
a ring at the 
door,heused tohide in the back
; a
nother m iracle,
 
likem any.  Nobody cam e whenhe was 
there. And he was sort of  supervising what was going on. He was given a li
ttle  mo ne y.  B ut 
we were ver y short of m oney.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In Novem ber
 
1941, Ibelieve,your m other received a farewell letterf rom  her 
m other, your grandm other. T ellus about that. 
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah. T hat's very diff icultfor me.  My m other received a letter 
despite the censorship.  Andm y grandm other, m y grandmotherf rom Ham burg, was saying 
farewell.  Shenever used the word suicide, but, indeed, she comm itted suicide.  She received

her f riends, her apartment had been taken.  
She was what's calleda " Jew house" not a ghetto, but the Jews wer e

roundedup there, waiting to be deported. And she realized that it was happening.  So she 
took an overdose.
 
 
My daughter went

bizarre c
all f rom  som eone at the German E
mbassy asking her to meet with them . W ould 
you 
m ind saying a little bitabout that?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. I know very l ittle, but m y motherm entioned that there w
a s 
a goodperson at the Germ an Em bassy who wanted to meet her. Andm y m other was so 

af raid tom eet him , butshe went. And m y father went sort of in another caf e.  Hehad money 
f rom  m y grandm other and the ring
,  
which m y sister hasnow.  So that was strange, but that 
was som em oney thatprobably helpedus toescape afterwards.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And som ehow your grandm other hadbeen able toget that through the
 
Germ an Em bassy to get to you.  Am azing.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Som e thingsare so strange.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about your dadbuying a cheap radio.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. It was the law that Jews couldnot keep their radio because 

the rum or was that Jews could understand all kinds off oreign languages and would tell about 
what was happening to the Germanarm ies. So all Jews had to give  their radio to City
 
Ha ll.   
Som y f atherbought acheap radio, gave it tothe City Hall, and kept, for them om ent, our good 

radio.  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas very clever.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W ell,m y f ather was ver y sm art. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the spring of 1942, Jews began, were ordered, to start wearing the Jewish 
star. T ell us how your m other handled that.

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah.  Right here.  On a Sunday morning.  My m other

it  wa s  
the law
; 
every Je w had to buy three Jewish stars with our ticke
t s, o ur clo t h in g t icke t s.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith your clothing ration, you had tobuy the stars.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Right.  So shesewed it on.  My ref lection was a little bizarre 
m aybe to hear today.  I said," Oh, it's sopretty, this yellow star
 
on m y green sweater."  And 
som ebody
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were a little girl.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Somebody that I interviewed recently in that project 
ﬁR
em em b e r
 
Me ﬂ 
said, 
ﬁO
h, I rem em berthat Sunday morning.  I was wearing a red dress.  I told m y mother, 
it's so pretty, yello w on m y red dress.
ﬂ
  
SoI was not the only one to m ake that ref lection.  
Yeah. 
 
 
And I didn't
 
--
 
ok. Andm y sister, though, 20m onthsolder, was called to the hea
d of  
her class andthe teacher said to the class you have to be very nice to this little girl because 
she's living in ver y difficult times. And m y sister rem embers. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter a m assive roundup inParis of  Jews in 1942, in the summer of 1942 is 

when your parents made the decision to leave f or the f inal
 
tim e. T ell us about that roundup.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hat roundup is called the 
V e l™ d ™Hiv
.  It was anarena on a sm all 
sort of  west side of Paris.  It's called by that tim ebecausethat was that infam ous roundupof  
m ostly foreign Jews.  And we
 
were foreign Jews.  And m ostlyf romthe center of Paris.  Itwas 
an order em anatingf rom  Germ any but done by the Frenchpolice.They wanted to round up 

27,000 Jews.  Andactually they rounded up17. And that's because there was
 g
ood police 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
17
 
who warned thepeople.  And I have somef riendsm y age who saidthat's whenmy parents 
andm y m otherand m y father didn't sleep intheir apartmentthat night.  They went to som e 
ver y good neighbors,and that saved them.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Otherwise the police came to the
ir hom e to get them .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. They forgot us. T hey f orgot to ring our bellalthough we 
were registered.  They went all over our neighborhood. And they cam etwo weeks af ter we 
f led. They didn't com e that day. T hose two days.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Another m iracle,as you say.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So wit h that, your parents are going to get you outof  Paris.  You toldm e that 

they plannedthe departure andhandled it very quietl y.  T ell usabout that.
 
>> J
acqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah. W ell,f irst of all, we hadGermans living upstairsf rom us.  
And that was not very good.  But upstairsf rom  the Germ ans was awonderful lady, Madam  
Dene
u x,  
who hatedthe Germ ans because her husband diedf rom  them ustard gas 
in the First 
W orldW ar. She wanted to help us, which was very dangerous because you were not allowed 

to help Jews.  Im ean,this was
 
--
 
she could have been put in prison.  It's strange
;  
tod a y I'm 
wearing this scarf  which she gave m efor m ywedding.  T hat comesa long, long way.
 
 
So anyway, m y parents at nightbroughtthings that were valuable to them
:  
s om e  
paintings, some things f rom m y grandm other. I don't know, that ringthatI wear which is f rom  

m y grandm other,I don't know 
if  sh e  left  it  with t h a t la
d y,  M
adam  Deneux
.  A
nd her son, 
P
ierre, 
a great help.  He andhis f riend, they were 15years old and they wer e working in the

underground. They were doing
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  15 years old inthe underground.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hey were doing ver y dangerous things.  He boughttrain tickets 
for us. And he bought
 
--
 
he took m y parents'backpacks.  Im agine,m y parents' livelihoodwas 
in two backpacks. T hey were not used to carrying backpacks.
 
 
Anyway, so we were not caught on that roundup.  My f atherhad secured two
 
--
 
you 
call them  sm ugglers these days.  In French it's passeur. T hey hadto trustthem .T hey didn't 

have any other choice.  They were about 20 years old.  My f atherhad topay them. I don't 
know exactl y 
if  it  
was them oney f rom m y grandmother.  I have no idea.
  
So it was arranged 
that we were going tom eet at the demarcation line. 
 
 
And we spent the lastnight at those wonderfulf riends whoalso risked their lives 
because they were helping Jews.  I remember playing pillo w f ights with
 
t he  lit t le  girl,  wh o  is  s t ill 
alive. W e see them  every time we go to Paris.
 
 
And Madam  Paris, was her name, was a very Catholic wom an, gave us,m y sister 
and m e and m y m other
 
--
 
I don't know m y father
 
--
 
a Catholic medal. T his is not
 
--
 
I don't 
know
 
--
 
t h is  is  
Notre Dam e de Lourdes.  Lourdes was a place inthe19th Century, and she 
said this will m aybe help you.  And to this dayI have m y medal. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Onceyou leave Paris, youf ind your way to Le Got.  Tell us how you got there. 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hat was quitean adventureto getthere because we tookthe 
Metro early in the morning.  There was no police.  Another m iracle.
  
W e got to the train and m y 
parents retrieved their backpacks and their ticketsf rom  that young man andhisf r
i e nd .   W e go t  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
19
 
on the train. Butthe train wouldn't leave andwouldn't leave.  And I remember thatand m y 
father was f rantic
, a
s you can imagine. And he went tothe head. T he wom an said
:  O
h yeah, 
they are rounding up Jews on the other sideof  the tracks. T hey m ust have had their quota of  

Jews that morning.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they didn't get to your car.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hat's right.  And the train lef t.  And we had to change trains 
Angoulem e.W e had to change trains.  My si sterf ell. And
 
tothis day she rem em bers how it 
hurt, you know, on thecem entor whatever the ground is in between two trains.  Shedidn'tget 

a concussion.  Another miracle. Because if  we had hadto go to ahospital with her, Jewis h 
papers
,  
that would have beenthe en
d.
 
 
So we m adethe othertrain and we got tothat little town which was at the border 
between the occupied and the non
-
occupied. T wo smugglers cam e.  They were 20 years old.  
T hey say
:  W
e can't take you.  Andm y parents f oundout
 
--
 
I don't know either i
t wa s to o 
dangerous or they wer e taking another Jewishf am ily.  But we got an appointment. T his was 
the last July, the lastday of  July
 
1942. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you're right on the border, the line
 
--
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. W echecked into a hotel. And the next day we walked and 
walked.  And it was hot.  It was the lastof  July or the 1st of August.And I remem ber resting 
under a tree. W e got to the cem etery behindthe church where we had an appointm ent.  And 
they were there.
  
So we started walking.  T hey were f rom  thatarea so they knew the area very, 
ve r y we l l .

Am  I speaking too much? 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  No. That's the wholepoint. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  So we were really on our knees. I rem em ber
 
--
 
the 
Ge rma ns  
were, like, there.  And we were there. And I rem ember seeing the tips of  their cigarettes. And 
m y f ather wrote later that actually there was am otorcycle.  Butanother miracle
; t
hey didn't 
have dogs.  And if I tell you to this day that Ihate German S
hepherds
, I'm  so rry, b u t the y 
f righten me.  But they didn't have those dogs.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you were able to pass undetected.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W ell, at one tim ethey were ver y clos e. T he two smugglers said, 

"G
odown on your knees!"   At that time,m y sister say, " Ihave todopeepee." It soundsfunny, 
but if they had heardus.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  So then, one of those two sm ugglers went ahead with his 

bicycle.  He had a signal with m y f ather, whistling, I guess, saying it's ok, you can go. Andthe 
otherone tookm y sister and me on the bicycle.  Because we couldn't walk f ast enough. And 
m y parents were running behind. And we m ade itacross the line.
 
 
T hen there was a contingent of French soldiers.  It was the Arm istice. There was a 
certain am ount, certain quantity of  French soldiers that were still allowed to
 
--
 
I don't know if  
they were baring arm sor were just there until later on when there were nom ore French

21
 
soldiers. T hey were there.  Andthey took usto the barracks. W e slept.  I think it was likeyou 
usefor cam ping that we slept.
  
And thenextm orning the comm ander said
:  C
an't keep you.  
T hey took us to
 
--
 
here in this country you have states and youhave
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Counties. 
 
>>
 
Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  The capital of the stateand thenthe sub capital.  Whatdo 
yo u  
call that?
 
>> Bill Benson: T he counties?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  No. W ell, anywa y.  It was not theprincip
le
 
town.  They lef tus 
there.W e had to go to a hotel.  In a hotel, you had to register.  My parentshad had their card 
saying " J
EW S
" and we went into the room because we were ver y tir ed. 
 
 
At 8:00
 
a knock at thedoor,"
P
olice."  And we were under arrest.  I don't rem em ber if  
m y sister and I stayed in the room ,but m y parents were interrogated
o
neaf ter the other
.  A
nd  I  
have the papersf rom  the archives
; f
r om  8 : 00
 
to 8:15and mother 8:15 to 8:30 saying that they 
were the Jewish race,were illegal, had never been arrested.  My f ather said that he was Dutch 
and that
 
he was
 
--
 
he had a job in 
P a ris
;  
th a t 
he had to leave.  He was always proud to say that 
he gothis driver's license in 1929.  I don't know if  he show
ed
 
it
 
thatday, but we were not 
refugees. But m y mother saidthat she was born in Hamburg
; s
h e  wa
s Dutch by m arriage.  It 
was ver y dangerous to say that she wasf rom Ham burg because Germ an Jews were 

im mediately put inone of  those cam ps, like
 
--
 
like other cam ps, becausethey were, according 
t o  Hit le r
 
--
 
I mean, becauseof  the laws of the Germans, she
 
was supposed to be sent to a 
cam p in Germ any and, of course, im mediately put todeath.
  
But the fact that she was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
naturalized Dutch probably saved her lif e.
 
 
So we were kept under surveillancef or onemonth in the capitalof  that state. Andm y 
parents had to report ever y day.  But they didn't put us in the campat that tim e.  Becausem y 
parents were reporting, they knew exactly wh ere we were.
  
I remember eating in those soup 
kitchens
, t h
e long table.  I didn't rem ember com plaining about thefood. I don't
 
rem ember that 
thefood was terribly bad.
 
 
And the head
 
of  that is called
 
[Speaking French]
.  
It was the law.  T he [Speaking 
French]
a
s stipulated had the right and theprivile ge to send us 
to  
a cam p, an internment cam p, 
or let us goto the country.  Andm aybe because we were not ref ugee
s 
and we were Dutchthat 
they let us. T hey said after onemonth
:  J
ustgo get lost in the countrys ide.  Andm y fatherwas 
able tof ind a little, little villa ge, 30 houses. And he askedperm ission. T hey said ok. It was 

le
ss than 100
 
k i l om et er s ,  6 0
 
m iles, f rom  the capital.
  
Of  course, wewere registered all thewa y 
to Vichy. T hey could com e and getus any day.  And we went to that little village.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas Le Got where youended up.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you were then now livin g in LeGot in this little vil lage.  InAugust
 
1943 your 
mo
ther gave birth to your brother,
 
Franklin.  And that was a very diff icult timef or your parents.  
T ell us about his birth and whatthat meantfor your parentsandf or you and your sister.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. It's a very long story.  My m other became pregnant. She 

didn't lose thepregnancy.  She was m iserable.  She stayed inone of those two room sm ost of  
the tim e.  My sister and I
 
actually went to thelittle school. T hem ayor, who was a wonderf ul

m an whosef am ily I hope will get a m edal of the righteous gentilesat the end of this year
 
--
 
anywa y, he advisedmy parents to send the two little gir ls, us, tothe school, which was 
e xt r
em ely dangerous
b
ecause the Gestapo 
c
ould come at any time.  
 
 
You m entionedthe date, 1943.  Let's notforget that November
 
11,1942, Hitler was 
sof urious af ter the Americans landed in Morocco.  Said,ok, I'm  invading France. There was 
no m ore dem arcati
on. The Germ ans were all over.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he entire country's occupied now.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Right.  So we were there in danger of our lif eor death every day.  
My f ather spent m ost of  his time
 
--
 
well, you don't have the photo there.  But he was in the 
underground. Thefarm erm ostprobably brought him som efood. He also gave us eggs. 

T here was not muchfood.  There were chestnuts.  My m otherm adebread with chestnuts, 
puree, anything with chestnuts. Apparently they're ver y healthy.
 
[Laughter]
 
So there was not much food.
  
Andonce ina while aroundthe house there was like som e trees 
and in season strawberries, wi ld strawberries. W edidn't get poisoned. W eatethe 

strawberries.  T hey we re good. 
 
 
Yeah,m y m other becam epregnant.  Shehad a terriblepregnancy.  I have little 
letters that I wrote, " I hopetom orrow you will f eel better."   And she was about to give birth that 
night.  It was August
 
1943. W e hearda little noise. My sister and Ishareda bed. T he 
neighbor downstairs
 
--
 
I should talk aboutthat neighbor,by the way
; s
uch a wonderf ulm an

s
aid, " gobackto sleep."  Andm y m otherhadto be transported. She was losing blood. She 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

hada very rare type, which Ihave, AB

plus. She was transported to
 
--
 
I don't know how m any
 
kilom eters, to where there was a clinic and where thedoctor was treating the Germ an soldiers 
--
 
you know, the German soldiers, hada cold or whatever they had,they were treated.  And on 
theother side there was a Jewish wom an.
 
 
My m other gave birth to a
 
l i t t l e b o y.  W e kn ew
 
--
 
in the spring m y parents toldus, you 
know, we have no money; you will not get a gif t, but there will be som ething or som eone that 

wi ll stay with us for the rest of our lives.  Andm y sister guessedthat it was going to be a baby. 
 
Andm y parents even told us the nam es.  If itwas a girl
,  
it would beMarianne, the sym bolof  
France
. And if  it was a boy,
 
it would be Franklin.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So not exactly a French name, Franklin.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Not atall.  Andwh y?  Because probably som e of  you realize that 

Franklin Roosevelt, at that tim e, was theonly hope of survi val f orm y parents. So they named 
m y brother
 
--
 
ye s .  
 
 
W hat I want to say and I didn'tm ention.  Youprobably know
 
--
 
that the neighbor 
downstairs was working for the railroad
 a
ndhe was denounced. And the Gestapo cam e. Five 
cars around that little house. T he whole village said, oh, that'sfor the 
M
e n de l s ,  c om i n g t o 
roundthem up.  No. It was f or him  because he had that word, the code
 
word. T he Gestap
o 
had
 
--
 
andthe collaborationists had the gun there. They were going to shoot him.  He should 
have said, couldhavesaid,m ight have said:  
l
e t  me  live
; w
h y don't you go upstairs and getthe 
Jewish f am ily.  He never said it. He was taken toa prison.  H
e s a i d
, 
when we m et him  af ter 
the war, that the torture was not that bad
.  B
ut henever, never said a word against us.  Never 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

25
 
said there was a Jewish fam ily upstairs.  Andthat, in itself, to save his lif e
 
--
 
he was young, 
m arriedhad a little baby girl him self.  Henever said it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And beyond what he did, you're in this small villa ge, presumably everybo dy in 
that village knew you were Jews.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy do 
you 
think you were not denounced and youwere able to continue 
living in Le Gotf oralmost two years?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W ell, a lotof  people had suffered terribly inWorldW arI. And a 
lot of people, most probably, disliked very m uch the Germ ans in general.
  
I was insultedonly 
once as 
a Jewish girl.  W ell, it's inm y book.  Idon'teven have to say the words.  It was
 
--
 
I ran 
home crying to m y m other, of course.  Otherwise nobody denounced us.
 
 
But when we interviewed thefam ily, thef a
rme rs
 
--
 
after the war, they said, you know, 
a ll of
 
us were scared and you never knew if  your neighbor was going to denounce you. And 
then the Germ ans came and they stole theeggs and whateverf ood there was and took itfor 

them selves.  So they were very scared, but they said, of course, you were m ore sca
red than 
anybody else.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  And, yes, you're right
; t
hey didn't denounce us
, t
he 30 houses.  
And we spenta lotof  tim e in the woods hiding.  Andm y f ather spenta lotof  time in that cellar 

where he couldn't
 
stand, couldn't lie.  He hadto crouch.
 
 
I remember oncehehad been hidingfor afew days.  He cam ehome.  Hehad a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

beard with white hair. And I couldn't recognize him.  He looked so old.  Andhe was really a 
young m an.  So it was a shockf orm e.  Of  course.  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about them ayor that youm entioned.T ell usabout him .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  He spoke to my f ather a lot. They trustedeach other.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was the m ayor of the villa ge, right?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes, them ayor of  the village.  He warnedus every tim e that 
there was extrem e danger because the troops, the Germ an troops, were going to go through 
the village.
  
At onetime m y parents thought it was too dangerousfor us to stay with them.  
T h e y w
anted toput usin a convent inthenext town.  And we were so happy.  Heprepareda 
little bag with things.  He came,or som ebody cam e, and saiddon't go.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Don't go to the convent.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W hich was a very good thing, we found outaf terwards, because 
the convent was raided.  Andthey would havef ound two little Jewis h girls there. W ould have 
been the endfor us.  Yeah.  Another m iracle.
 
 
And then som ething

if  you seem y bookaf terwards, you'll see that thef irst is

>> Bill Benson:  Prepared touse if needbe.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Idon't know if she was inf luenced by her mother's suicideor 

what it was.  I took it f or granted. I told m y littlef riend at school
:  O

m other said? And m y sister said it to her little girlf riend. And m y sister and I justf orgot.W e 

erasedthe whole thing.  But when we went back tothe village 14 years ago, and that manwho 
was m y age, of cour

D

b a ck.  

>> Bill Benson:  He rem em bered you telling them that you hadthese pills.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. And the girl Sim one remembered with m y sister also.  

Anybody a psychologist here, you realize we j ust erased it.  Strange.  No? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  No,I'm  not surprised. 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  No?  Ok.

a b ou t  c om i n g ba c k  t o ge t  h i s f am i l y.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W ell, atf irst after the landing it was evenmoredangerous
 
b
ecause theGermanswere retreated. T heywere burning ever y vill age. T here was one 
vil lage, m y f ather wrote
 
--
 
to this day it's amem orial. T hey put thewom en, children inthe 
ch

entirely

it was ver y cl ose to our village.  For som e reason they went throughour village.  I 
rem em ber looking out the window andm y m other telling me,"

because they couldhave shot me. So it was ver y dangerous.
 
 
But f inally, yeah, on August
 
28, 1944, Paris was liberated.  At f irst my f ather
 
--
 
m y 
parents didn't dare do anything.  Butf inally in Novem ber
 
1944, he said, well, I'm  going to go 
b a ck.   
And the trains were not working.  I don't know
 
--
 
he probably went by bicyc le.  I'm not 
sure. T hesedays it takes three hours to go. I don't know how long i t took him.  He wentback.  
 
 
And theapartment, our apartm ent,had beenvacated by the Germ ans.  
Of  co u rse 
they f ledaf ter the liberationof  Paris.  And the apartm ent was em pty.  And the concierge said, 

well, go to the City Hall and you'll seem aybesom e of  yourfurniture is there.  Indeed,m yf ather 
found our bed,a dresser, a few things which he put
 
back. And he claim ed our apartment, 
which was ver y 
wi s e
 
because any ref ugee which was alive was claim ing anempty apartment. 
T here was a great shortage of  apartm ents inParis.  And he went back.  And at the endof

father getting papers without " J

the m edal, 
you know, housed us until we could go backtoour apartm ent.
 
 
My m other wrote inm y journal that I was so sad thatI hadnom ore toys.  But she 
said, 
ﬁW
ell, you're abig gi rl now, you'll get more important things.
ﬂ  
 
W e got a four
-
year scholarship,m y sister and I, in a wonderf ul private school.  The 
head of the school was a hero in theundergroundherself .  She andher brother savedanother 

fam ily.  She didn't help us because itdidn'thappen that way f or us. But four years
 s
o we could 
catch up.  And I ha
d my f irst lessons in Englis h when I was 10.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Let's go backf or a m inute.  Iwant you to tellus about yourfather when hef irst 
learned the news that there hadbeenan invasion by
 t
he allies of Norm andy.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  He was
 
not inhiding that morning.  He was in a tree.  It was 
June.  It was the season for cherries.  So hewanted to get cherriesso we would have some 
food.  He was in thetree. And thenheheard, " Am erica!"   Hef ellf rom  the tree outof  joy. By 
th a t tim e m y
 
sister and I were wr iting in our journal.  I knew how to spell D
-
Day.  I rem em ber 
spelling the war.  I remem ber writing in m y jo urnal
,  
which I donatedto the Museum  now, 
saying I hoped that the war wil l end soon.
 
 
And then som ething so sad.  I said that I
 
want to seem y grandm other andm y uncle 
andm y aunt. Littledid I know that they were all m urdered. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to ask youa bit more about that inam om ent.  You toldme thatonce 

you were back in Paris and trying to re
-
establish your lives that you
 
took upm usic with a

passion. 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  
I n 
your introduction it's clearthatthat rem ainstoday. T ell usabout that time, 
this passionfor music that youhad.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. W ell,as I m entioned, there was nom oney.  My parents put 
whatever je welr y at the pawnshop, the national pawnshop. T here was really no money.  But I 
hada littlebicycle that had remained in the cellar where we lived.  I startedpiano. I was ver y 
bad.  And then m y mother said, well, how about the cello?  I had no idea.  You can im agine, I 
hadn't been toa concert or anything.  My sister had started the violin there
 w
hen we got back.  
So the teacher, the violin teacher, introducedm eto the cello teacher.  I had
 
a 3/4 size atthat 
tim e. I came home with m y mother.  I satdown.  And I played open string.  I just loved it. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And continue to pursuethat.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes, to this day.  Right.  And then, of course, I neededaf ull 
s iz
ed.  My cello teacher found a cello inanattic hadbeen completely ref urbished. Beautiful 
cello.  My parents soldm y bicycle, 100
 
f r an c s
, 
and got the cello.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkthat was a good swap. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
Of course, when you were back in Paris in Novem ber of 1944, the war was 
continuing elsewhere until May of  
‚
45. 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Exactly.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know, were your parentsor othersf earf ul that the Germansm ight

com e back because the war was still going on? 
 
>> J a c
queline Mendels Birn:  I can't answer that. Maybe they did. Butm ostly my father was 
concernedabouthis Dutchfam ily.  Becausehe said, well, we survi ved;probably they are in 
hiding and survived, too.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At what pointdid
 
you 
learn about the magnitude of the losses in yourf am ily?  
As you said,over 200of  your Dutchfam ily were killed during theholocaust.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Murdered. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W erem urdered.W hen didthefull brunt of that becom e known to you?
 
>> J a c qu
eline Mendels Birn: W ell, atf irstm y father got in touch with the 
I
nternational Red 
Cross, m aybealso with the Dutch Red Cross.  And thenhefoundout that his mother andhis 
brotherand his sister and the in
-
laws and thecousins.  The initial list was about 18 persons
 
t
hat had been murdered
; m
ostly f rom  Holland, roundedup in Am sterdam and othertowns, 
roundedup in a vestibule.  
 
 
In them useum , inthe third floor, which like inFrance
 
--
 
in Holland itwas vestibule.  
T hat's where they ended up. I even
 
have a letterf rom a great auntsaying that they wanted 
this or that.T here was a little19
-
month
-
old little Miriam  who was just learning to walk and she 
needed som e toys. 
 
 
So I rem ember com ing hom ef rom  school, that private school.  Andm y sister and I
 
were arguing.  You know, children, 10 and12 argue som etimes.  Andm y m other said b
e qu i e t
.
  
W esaw the telegram  on the dresser.  And that was the announcement thatmy uncleand aunt 
hadbeen deported.  It didn't say, I don't think, that they were m urdered.  But we knew to a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

32
 
cam p like it, there'snot m uch chance that you come back. 
 
 
Sof rom  18m urderedpeople, Auschwitz and other cam ps, we stated that. And well, 
rather recent,I did a lot of  research in Google andf ound out that among the in
-
la ws, th e  fa
m ily,  
in Dutch, that they had been deported, too.  But still that didn'tamount to maybe more than 50, 
60 people. That was big enough. And then very recently m y brother's daughter, Jessica, who 
wa s  m y 
e
ditor
-
in
-c
hief on m y book, found out
 
--
 
she dida lot of  research, that over 
200 
m em bers.  Ihave the list 
here
. 
 
IthinkI only have about 70 or75of  the closest.  My father 
c a m e f r om  a  la r ge  f am i l y
; o
ver 200 m em bers. Over whelm ing. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It's incom prehensible.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.  Nobody cam e back.  Nobody cam eback. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jacqueline, you just told me,I think, just this week, just a few weeks ago here 

in thism useum was a conferenceof  theInternationalT racing Service and youm eta professor 
f r om  F r an c e .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about the signif icanceof  that.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. Theprof essor, Ifound out ina list ofprofessorsf rom  all 

over the world thatthat prof essor was com ing.  I said I wanted to meet him. So 
I cam e that 
T uesday morning.  Imet him .  He's doing research on thatarea where we were hiding.  I said, 
you know, to thisday
 
--
 
although we were declared as Dutch Jews, in February
 
1943 all the 
Dutch Jews with the Germ an Jews andthe Czech Jews and the Rom anian Jews, they wer e all 

on the list to be deported. And the Dutch were on the list.  And wewere not on the list. And I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
33
 
askedhim  why.  Andhe said at that particular tim e, this was February
 
--
 
I th in k it's 
February
 
23,1943, they exem pted Dutch Jewish wom en that were pregnant.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dutch Jewish wom en who were pregnant.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. And how did the authorities, theFrench police, know that 
m y m other was pregnant?  Either shehad tobe declared by them ayor becausea 
pregna nt  
wom an who I guess was getting more [Speaking French]
, y
ou know, f ood tickets, or because 
m y m other went to see a doctor. I know because Ihave an envelopef rom
 
--
 
I can't really see 
the stamp. She musthave gone to see adoctor atone time. And
 
the doctor m aybe had to 
declare.
 
 
Anyway, he's doingf urther research inthat. But thefact isthat we were not deported 
that day. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  But atany other tim e you would have been deported.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: That day we wouldhave b
een on the list. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthat particularm om ent you were exem pted
.   Ma
ybe af ew weeks later that 
wouldn't have happened.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hat's right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  One last question before weclosef or theday.  I'm going to turnback to you to 

close the program .
  
You've just published your book.W hathasthism eant to you to publish? 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W ell, seven years ago I was still work ing and I had to leavem y 

job because of serious illness.  And I was terribly depressedaf terwa rds.  My son
-
in
-
l a w,  
Nikolai, Russian, wonderful man, said, 
ﬁ
Jacqueline, why don't you start writing your m emoir?

And seven years agom y granddaughter was 7. W ell, she's 13 1/2.W hat was itf or you atthat 
age?  I said
,  ﬁ
I don't know
 
how to start.
ﬂ
  
He said, 
ﬁO
ne sentence at a time.
ﬂ  And 
I d i d . 
 
I had written, because I was work ing at the Foreign Service Institute and I had spoken about 

our years, but that's when I started intensiveresearch,until 1:00
 
in them orning. It tookm e si
x 
years. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Six ye ars.  If irstm et you in 2008, six years ago
.  Y
ou had a working 
m anuscript that you shared with m e.
 
 
I'm  going to close our 
program  in a mom ent.  In fact, 
Jacqueline will  close our 
program .
  
I want tothank all of you for beinghere with us. I appreciate it very m uch. W e'll

com e back.  If not, look for ourprogram  if  you com e toW ashington, D.C. in 2015 and the 
Museum 's website will have inf ormation about that.
 
 
W edidn'thave an opportunity for questions and answers with Jacqueline. I 
apologize for that. I think you can see we could have spentthe restof  the afternoon and 
beyond hearing morefrom  Jacqueline. W e just got a glim pse.
  
Of course, her book hasm ore 
detail in it thanthat. 
 
 
I'm  going toturn to Jacqueline to closeour program . W hen she's done, she's going 
to step off the stage here and go up tothe top where you all came inbecause she'll be signing 

copiesof  her book there.  That's where you'llfind Jacqueline after the program . 
 
 
It's our tradition at

u all to stand because our photographer, Joel, is going to com eon stage, takea picture

--
 
you probably have 
not yet visited the Museum
 a
nd learned a lotm oreaboutthis horrif ic story of the Holocaustand 
about them onster that Hitler was.  Shouldn'thave been a monster,should have been apainter 
buthe was ref used ina school of painting.  If you readhis biography, you will see that.
 
 
In any case, what I want to say
 
--
 
and I speak to a lotof  people, young people, andI 
end m y
 
--
 
the story of m y survi val by tellin g them that eventhough there are genocides,and 
we know that, on thisplanetthey have to try
 
--
 
and maybe you havechildren, grandchildren 
around. They have totry and choosea job or a profession.  It doesn't have tobeam agnif icent 
job.  It can be a very sm all job.
  
It can be nurses.  It can be policemen,policewom en.  Butwhat 
I tell them is do good
, t
ry and im prove
 t
hisplanet. Otherwise we'll have to move toanother 
planet
 b
ecause thisone seem s to be rotten these days.  I'm  sorry to use that word but there 
are 
toom any bad things.  And we would like to try to im prove things, to improve conditions.  I 
would like you to carry thatm essage with you home andtell it to your children
, y
our 
grandchildren, or yourselves.
