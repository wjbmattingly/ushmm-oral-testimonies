MARTIN GAUDIAN 
February 16, 2011 
   
Question:  This is the United States Holo
caust Memorial Museum interview conducted 
with Mr. Martin Gaudian on February 16th,
 2011 conducted by Ena Nasadoskis (ph) at 
the United States Holocaust Memorial Muse
um. And we will begin our interview, Mr. 
Gaudian, first of all, b y  th
anking you for ag reeing to meet 
with us, for coming all this 
way from Milwaukee to see us today, and I 
would like to start it 
pretty much at the 
beginning.  We're going to
 be talking about your service in
 the U.S. military, but to get to 
that point, I would like to know a little bit 
about you. So could 
you tell me where you 
were born, when  you were born? 

Answer:  Okay. 

Q:  And we'll go from there. 

A:   I was born in Paullina, Iowa, a small 
town of about 900 pe
ople, on October 27th, 
1922. 

Q:   Do you have brothers and sisters? 

A:   Yes.  I have two brothers and one sist
er. Two brothers -- one br
other is 90, the other 
one is 86 now, and my sister is 76. 

Q:   So she's the baby of the family? 

A:   Right. 
Q:   Okay. 
A:   I was 12, I think, when she was born. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
4 
Q:   So are you the second youngest? 
A:   I'm the second, right. 
Q:   Okay.  And your mother and yo
ur father, what are their names? 
A:   My father was Albert H. Gaudian an d my mother was Dora Wilhelmina Gaudian.  
And he was born in Germany an
d he came over to the Un ited States when  he was nine 
years old, and when  he was, I believe, 32 he
 was in the Army in 
Wo rld War I and went 
over to Germany, yes. 

Q:   And what Œ 

A:   He was a bugler in France. 
Q:   Do you know what part
 of Germany he came from? 
A:   It's PomeraniA: 
Q:   Ah, yes, Pommern. 

A:   Right.  I think that's where it was,
 right.  My mo ther was born in Chicago. 
Q:   Uh-h um. 

A:   Right. 

Q:   So you're actually first genera
tion American on your father's side? 
A:   That's right. 

Q:   And did he still speak German? 

A:   Yes, he did.  In fact, we went to a German church.  I also 
learned to speak German 
because he had a brother living 
with us who sp oke German and 
I sort of learned as I went 
along. 

Q:   Did you?  

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
5 
A:   And I took three years in college and 
it worked out very well 
for me, because I knew 
a lot of vocabulary. 
Q:   At home did your mo ther know German? 
A:   Yes. 

Q:   So did they speak German at home? 

A:   They  did at the beginning. 
Q:   They  did at the beginning? 
A:   And then, of course, when the '30s came,
 when the thing happen
ed over there, they 
didn't  like that in the United States, you know,
 so they cut out the 
German service.  But 
originally when I went to our church, Lu
theran church, they 
had German, they had 
English for a few years, ri
ght, in the 20s, I imagine. 
Q:   Did you see yourself as -- I mean, 
it may sound like a strange
 question but did you 
see yourself as German, German-American, or 
just an American who had some sort of 
roots in Germany? 

A:   That's what I wo uld say, American, ri
ght, right.  I don't know -- I imagine we -- he 
still had relatives over there, I'm sure. 
 About nine children came over here. 
Q:   Wow. 

A:   It was a big family. 

Q:   And why did th ey do that
?  Why did he come over here? 
A:   Well, I think they just wanted to get th
e good life over here, I 
think, you know.  They 
wanted to  give -- and some of the children di
ed of that flu that came around, I guess. 

Q:   Oh, in 1918? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
6 
A:   Right.  They  didn't make it.  They lost
 several, two or three, I'm sure.  Uh-hum. 
Q:   And did they all settle in Iowa? 
A:   Yes.  My father, I believe, he was a carp
enter, most of his life, but his father farmed. 
In fact, his father passed away 
wh en I was about three or four years old, and at that time 
when  someone died, they had them in your 
parlor, in your own home, and I had never 
seen him. 

Q:   So your grandparents we
re also there?  It wasn't ju
st your father who had left? 
A:   No.  My grandparents, right, and he st
arted the farm, and then my father moved to 
this small town and became a 
carpenter, contractor.  He onl
y had about a fourth grade 
education, but he lear
ned it all by himself. 
Q:   Was he a good carpenter? 
A:   Yes, he was.  I w o rked for him for year
s before I went into the army after I graduated 
from high school for years -- for one year, 
I guess, and we built many farm buildings:  
Barns and corn cribs and hog houses. 

Q:   Things like that? 

A:   Right.  Uh-hum. 
Q:   So you grew up in -- can yo
u tell me the town's name again? 
A:   PaullinA: 
Q:   PaullinA: 
A:   P-A-U-L-L-I-N-A, right, PaullinA: 
Q:   PaullinA: 

A:   I guess it was named maybe after a Paul and a Lina, probably . 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
7 
Q:   It could very  well be. 
A:   Right. 
Q:   I have an aunt named PaullinA: 
A:   My mother's name is unusual, 
WilhelminA: A good German name, I guess. 
Q:   That's right. 

A:   So we both were in the war.  He was in
 World War I.  I had a picture taken with me 
with my uniform and him.  I wish I wo
uld have brought that and showed  that. 
Q:   How interesting.  Did he talk
 about his service in World War I? 
A:   Not -- well, he mentioned that in the tr
enches he did get some of that experience and 
he was a bugler.  I mean, he talked about that
.  He still played the 
bugle.  When he was 
home, he would entertain us with that once in a while. 

Q:   Did he ever talk about it feeling a little 
strange or did it feel st
range to him that, you 
know, he came from Germany and he was 
fighting on th e American side against 
Germany? 

A:   You know, I never heard anything abou
t that.  I think of that now, but never, not 
really. 
Q:   Okay. 
A:   No.  They didn't  mention that  at all, that they were fighting... 

Q:   Do you know what year
 he came to the United States? 
A:   Yes.  It was -- let's see.  I thi
nk it was about 19 -- 1906 maybe, somewhere right 
around.  He came th
rough Ellis Island. 
Q:   He did? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
8 
A:   Right.  Uh-hum. 
Q:   I'm sure you could find him on the ship
 lists up there because they have a wonderful 
mu seu m. 

A:   Right, right.  I gave them a donation once
 and I guess my  name is there somewhere, 
too, now. 

Q:   And your mother, tell us 
a little bit abou
t your mo ther. 
A:   Well, she was born in Chicago, and then
 she was one of these a farmer -- let's see, 
how was that?  Her mo ther wasn't married at 
the time.  I guess he le
ft them or something 
and so sh e wanted a husband, and that's a tim
e when they used to write letters to Iowa, 
and there was a man there who 
had accepted -- you know, wanted
 her to come and be his 
wife, and that's what she did. 

Q:   Her mother? 

A:   Her mother.  And then sh
e came with her, of course, and 
so she was a half sister to 
four other full sisters.  And that was a big fa
mily, also.  I think there were eight of them. 
Q:   Oh, my. 

A:   Yeah.  It's 
a real large family. 
Q:   Did you know your aunts and 
your gran dparents on her side? 
A:   Well, I only got to see the father, grandp
A:  The mother was gone.  I can 't remember 
her, no, I cannot. Then my mother went to
 a German school in
 German to wn  was th e 
name of a town where she was, but it was a 
farming community.  Very small, but it had a 
church, a Lutheran chur
ch, in German.  They spoke Germ
an there for a while.  But then 
when she came to Paullina,
 then it switched over. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
9 
Q:   And how did your parents 
meet?  Did they ever tell you? 
A:   No, they  didn't.  Well, he had a brothe
r, I guess, and th ey both found the two sisters, I 
guess, and th at's how it happened , uh-hum. 
Q:   What year did your parents marry? 

A:   They were married -- let'
s see, they were married in 19
 -- what was it?  1 9 20, I think 
it was, or '1 9.  Right after he came back from 
that. He was a little older, too.  He was 32, I 
believe, and she was about 20 or 21.  Sh e 
lived to be 92. He lived to be 99 -- 
Q:   Wow. 

A:   -- my father. 
Q:   Wow.  Those are ripe old ages. 
A:   He had a brother who was 99 also.  An
d the other sisters all 
made it into their 90s 
except one, I guess. 

Q:   Tell me a little bit about the town.  Did 
your mother stay home?  Was her job raising 
the kids? 

A:   Yes.  She was a homemaker, v ery good
 cook, and she sold 
and had clothing clubs 
and that was about it, I guess, right.  She 
was a real homemaker.  She taught me how to 
make cakes and bread and how 
to make ___+.  I appreciate it now, because my  wife 

teaches piano and so  once in a 
while I make the meals n o w. 
Q:   She must appreciate that. 
A:   Yeah, right.  And her coffeecake was super. 
Q:   Tell me a little bit about the towns. 
 You mentioned before they were small and 
people was it? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
10 
A:   Right, about 900 to 1,000.  Maybe to
day it might be just a shade over, but it was -- 
well, let's see, they had one or two grocery st
ores is all and th en one bank, and mo st of 
them were farmers.  They wo
uld come in on Saturday  nights,
 that was a great night in a 
small town.  You know, the band played.  
I played in th e band in high school, and we 
would be on the center of the town , you kn
ow, playing, and people were walking th e 
streets.  And Saturday night was 
a real get-together for everybody. 
Q:   Could you say that you 
knew everybody 
in the town? 
A:   Almost everyone, right.  Yes, just about.
 You did, yeah.  And they're all gone now.  
Almo st everyone that I knew,
 I think, they 're all gone. 
Q:   So we'l l keep on going.  Hang on a minut
e. In the town were th
ere -- was it mostly a 
Lutheran town?  Was it mostly pe
ople who were German immigrants? 
A:   I would say it was very heav y on German 
immigrants.  Very heavy, I believe.  Yes, it 
would be, uh-hum. 
Q:   And were there any other denominations? 
A:   Although there were -- yes.  T h ere 
were Methodists, Presbyterian.  We had 

Norwegian. 
Q:   Norwegian? 
A:   Uh-hum.  Those four.  You had Presby
terian, Norwegian, Meth odist, Lutheran, uh-
hum. 
Q:   Any Catholics? 
A:   No, no Catholic
s.  Not in
 ou r to wn . 
Q:   Okay. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
11 
A:   There's one nearby, though, I guess, in 
Primghar, I think it was. 
 Uh-hum, that's right. 
There was none, no Catholic ch
urch.  No, not in our town. 
Q:   Any Jews? 
A:   What? 

Q:   Any Jews? 

A:   Maybe one or two.  I think so.  I don't rememb er.  Possibly. 
Q:   Possibly? 
A:   Irish.  A few Irish.  But let's see.  What 
else?  Let me think.  That's about it.  It was 

strong on the German side, right, uh-hum. 
Q:   But I would take it that there wasn't a 
synagogue or a Catholic
 church  or something 
like that? 
A:   No, no. 

Q:   So no larger
 communities there? 
A:   No. 

Q:   So mainly farmers, mainly Germ
an, not entirely, Norweigian as well? 
A:   Right, and small businesses like the 
lumberyard and painters and carpenters, 
whatever, several besides my father. And, we
ll, we had a small high school. Now it's  a 
consolidated.  They took three 
towns and put them together, I guess.  I graduated in 1941. 
Q:   You graduated and so you were 17, 18 years old in 1941? 
A:   Right.  I was a little older.  I was 18, I believe. 
Q:   You were 18? 

A:   Yeah. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
12 
Q:   What did you do after that? 
A:   Well, then I worked for my father 
about two years carpen
tering and then I was 
drafted. 

Q:   When were you drafted? 

A:   I went in in 1943, April of '43.  I sp
ent three years and one mo nth altogether, I think, 
in the Army. 
Q:   Can you tell me ab out -- you have an olde
r brother and an older sister; is that right? 
A:   My older brother, he was in the Co as
t Guard.  He rode a horse along th e North 
Carolina shores watching fo r bodies that wa
shed up when the Germ
an submarines were 
out close to our coast. 
Q:   And did he find th
em?  Were there bodies? 
A:   Once in a while he would find a body co
ming in and he had to 
report things like that. 
Q:   Well, how ab out -- and explain to me 
more if there was a German submarine along 
the coast, does that mean if 
there was someone walking along the beach that they would 
shoot them? 

A:   Possible.  It could be.  Yes, he did carry a gun. 
Q:   He did carry a gun? 
A:   Yes, he did. 

Q:   But where did the bodies co
me from?  From the submarine? 
A:   From the ships that were sunk. 

Q:   I see. 

A:   Right. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
13 
Q:   I see. 
A:   And even when I shippe
d out from Boston, we had the same scare.  We went out too 
far on a big convoy ship , they spotted a German
 sub ev en in '43 quite
 close, and we had 
cruisers going around our Liberty Ship and they
 did drop some depth charges later, but I 
don't know if they ever got the sub or not. 
Q:   So your brother, wh en he entered th
e Co ast Guard, did he volunteer for the Coast 
Guard? 

A:   Yes, he did volunteer, right. 

Q:   Okay. 
A:   And then my  other younger brother was al
so -- he ended up in Be
lgium.  In fact, one 
time we were very close together, I guess, but didn't know it. 
Q:   So you had three sons
 [sic] in the U.S. military? 
A:   Right. 
Q:   One in the Coast 
Guard, two in the Army? 
A:   My daughter -- other daughter was in 
the Air Force as a nurse.  So two, yeah. 
Q:   By three sons, I meant your father's  sons. 

A:   All three of us boys were in the service, right. 
Q:   Your elder brother, t
hough, he signed up before 1943? 
A:   Yes, he did.  I think it was '42.  He wa
s one year ahead of me, right.  He's three years 
older than I am. 

Q:   What about the other boys in your
 class? Were most of them drafted? 
A:   Yes.  Two of them shipped out with me
 when  I went in and I ended up in Kearns, 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
14 
Utah, and they went on to CaliforniA:  So  
I was chosen for the Air Force first and they 
went to the Infantry, I guess, in CaliforniA: 
Q:   And wh en you were drafted, wa
s that the first time you left Iowa? 
A:   For any long it was -- for trips is all I ha
d taken, Des Moines, the capitol, our senior 
class went there, and that's about it, right. 
Q:   Your senior class went, too, but 
did you go out of state someplace before? 
A:   Oh, yes.  We went to South Dakota on
ce. There was a radio station there that my 
mo ther liked in Yankton, South Dakota, and sh
e used to listen to th
e broadcast from there 
and she wanted to go th ere. 
Q:   So you did? 
A:   Yeah, right.  Never made it to  Chicago, 
though.  I didn't.  That was it though, really. 
Q:   That was it? 

A:   Uh-h um. 
Q:   Well, you said earlier that in the '30s, 
when things started happen ing in Germany, 
something changed in  the atmo sphere and so 
your folk s didn't  speak German at home as 
much or -- 

A:   Right. 
Q:   -- there wasn't a service in German anymore? 

A:   Right. 
Q:   Do you have any memori
es of how that happened, becau
se if the town was heavily 
German background Œ 
A:   Well, let's see.  It was just -- I guess 
they were afraid of what other people were 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
15 
thinking.  That was it.  Now, some people 
probably were turned 
off by that, you know, 
that we still had a -- I don't think they riot
ed  or anything or had posters on the street 
corners but that would have happ
en ed  p e rh aps in  
a larger city. 
Q:   Did you have news of what was going on in Germany?  How mu ch intern ational 
news did you get? 

A:   Well, not very much, really.  Well, 
we had the Des Moin es Register, which was a 
good paper but it -- oh, yes, we did have it there, yes. 

Q:   And were your main news sour
ces that newspaper or other sources? 
A:   Yeah.  The Des Moines Register, we had 
the Sioux City Journal, and, of co urse, our 
local, but they printed occasi
onal articles from what the World News would say, but, you 
know, other than that, no. 

Q:   What about radio? 

A:   Oh, yes, radio was strong.  Right.  
Yeah, we would sit ther
e and listen to those 
programs, Andy Gu mp  and all of those old 
on e.  A mo s  'n ' A n dy
, that was a favorite, 
right. 

Q:   I'm trying Œ 
A:   And music, we liked -- she liked
 the music from th ere.  Lawrence Welk. 
Q:   Oh, yes. 
A:   In fact, he came to  our town. 
Q:   That must ha
ve been an event. 
A:   He played in ou
r town  wh en he had about six or seven people. 
Q:   Oh, my goodness. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
16 
A:   Lawrence Welk, right.  In that little town of Paullina he became famous, right. 
Q:   I'm sure. 
A:   He became a millionaire, billionaire, ri
ght.  And that was a Saturday, I remember 
that, and he was there. 
Q:   When you were drafted, the war ha
d started but the Unite
d States hadn't been 
involved yet? 
A:   Right. 
Q:   And you were drafted befo
re Pearl Harbor; is that right? 
A:   No.  After. 
Q:   Excuse me.  You were after -- 
A:   After Pearl Harbor. 

Q:   You were drafte
d in June of '43? 
A:   I was probably -- I was signed up already 
right away .  You know, we had to sign up 
at 18, I think it was, or whatever it was. 

Q:   Excuse me, so I co nfused it.  Yo
u graduated probab ly befo re Pearl Harbor? 
A:   Right, so they held off 
two years before they called me
. I'm surprised in a way that 
they called all three of us from one family
.  Today they  probably wouldn't  do that 
anymore. 

Q:   That's right. 
A:   But we were all th ree.  And my
 mother had three stars on the window. 
Q:   She mu st have been pretty
 scared, too. Proud and scared. 
A:   She was, right. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
17 
Q:   Can you tell me, d o  you remember news of Pearl Harbor? 
A:   Yes.  I remember
 exactly where I was. 
Q:   Where were you? 

A:   I was coming out of a movie theater in 
our town , it had been a western or something, 
and I get to the middle of the street and so
meone yells out, "we've been attacked."  I 
know exactly where I was on that 
street.  I can put an X there. 
Q:   Really? 

A:   Yes. 

Q:   And so it really stuck in your memo ry? 
A:   Yes, right. 
Q:   In what way?  What did y
ou feel when that that happened? 
A:   Well, the trouble was we weren't fo
llowing th e news close enough wh at was going 
on.  We should have almost known that some
thing was going to happ
en, but in this little 
town  I don't think many people there either got
 -- really got it, put it together, so it was a 
shock, yes, it was. 

Q:   Yeah. 
A:   And then, of course, they said, ut-oh,
 that means you'll probably be going soon, and 
people were talking. 
Q:   Were there -- oh, go ahead. 
 You wanted to say something? 
A:   We left from a -- when I left, we le
ft from a small town about 10 miles from our 
home town on a bus to Des Moines, go ther
e early in the mo rning, about 4:00 or 
something, and we had to 
take a test right away. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
18 
Q:   And how many people left on
 that bus?  Was it a sp ecial bus? 
A:   There were about six of us going for th
e Army  and there were other people on th ere 
just going to  Des Moines. 
Q:   So it was a regular public bus? 

A:   Uh-hum.  Right. 

Q:   So you said good bye to
 your folks at the bus stop? 
A:   Well, my father came.  I said  good by
e to my mother, and that was something.  And 
we got -- we stayed there about two days before
 they assigned us, to put
 us on the trains.  
Quite an experience for a young person, you 
know, leaving like that, but at that age I 
don't think that we gave it as much th
ought as we should have, you know, but... 

Q:   Do you reme mb er any of your thou
ghts going through you
r mind at that time? 
A:   Not a whole lot, but when we left, it so
rt of had gotten away from me, but I know the 
test was early in the mo rning and we were
 tired, but I must have scored quite well 
because they picked me for the Air Force, and I figured -- 
Q:   That's a pretty good place. 

A:   -- that's a little boost, right.  I guess I had enough left.  And I did graduate.  I won th e 
allegiant award for the person who was sup
posed to be successful in the class.  
Q:   So tell us a little bit about th at?  So you
 took the test in Des 
Moines, and then what 
h a pp en ed  after th at?  

A:   I went to Kearns, Utah, and stopped th er
e. We stopped along as we dropped them off 
all alongthe way, but I was the first 
one dropped off, I guess, at Kearns. 
Q:   By bus? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
19 
A:   On train. 
Q:   By train? 
A:   Right.  That was a train -- it w as an old 
base that they changed into a training base 
for the Air Corps.  And then they
 sent me to school in Colora
do, Fort Collins.  I went to a 
six-week school there and I worked for -- I me
an, the airplane supply when I went to Fort 
Dix, New Jersey, and that's where I was stationed for two years. 
Q:   So let me retrace these steps. Do you 
remember th e day you were -- not drafted but 
the day you left home to start your Ar
my service?  What month was that? 
A:   April. 

Q:   That was April, 1943? 
A:   Right. 

Q:   And so you're in Des Moines for tw
o days and then  you're in Kearns, Utah? 
A:   Kearns, Utah. 
Q:   And stayed for how long? 
A:   Probably six weeks, eight weeks. 

Q:   How large was Kearns, Utah?  How large was the base? 
A:   Oh, it was a big base.  I would imagine 
 there was over 20,000 th
ere probably.  It was 
quite  large.  And each of us was assigned 
a drill master, you know
, for a group in our 
barracks. 

Q:   Did people already assume that the U.
S. is going to go to  
war with Germany in 
Europe, or were you thinking mo re or less 
you would be shipped out somewhere in the 
Pacific? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
20 
A:   Yeah, I think so .  I think the Pacific wa
s mo re in the minds of people.  I think it was 
Being (?marry?) and all in that part, but 
then so metimes they 
would ship you from 
California to go  the other way, from the other 
direction to go that way, that was hard to 
figure out sometimes. 
Q:   You're in the Army now? 

A:   Right.  And then  wh en the bombs came
 -- I don't know if you want me to tell you 
about it now. 

Q:   Oh, I do, but I'm going to get there. 

A:   Oh, okay. 
Q:   I'm going to  get there. I want to get a se
nse of -- I want to get a sense of what various 
stops you were on in your Army
 service, on your military serv
ice.  So we're starting with 
the Air Force and you went from Kearns, Utah Œ 
A:   To Fort Collins,
 Colorado, by train again, and ha
d about a two-mont
h course there. 
Q:   On what? 

A:   An Army course
 for the Air Corps. 
Q:   For the Air Corps? 
A:   For working in a maintenance area wh
ere you supplied the supplies for B-17s.  Yes, 
it was a B-17 base, and then I 
worked there two years.  I 
got my  promotions in one 
month, three months in row.  
It starts out PFC and then corp
oral and sergeant, right up th e 
ladder. 
Q:   Well, pretty fast? 

A:   It was quick. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
21 
Q:   Yeah. 
A:   And then I went over there. 
Q:   So you went from Fort Co
llins then you go to Fort Dix? 
A:   No.  Fort Collins -- yes, 
yes, that's right.  First I went
 to Mitchel Field up in Long 
Island. 
Q:   What's that? 
A:   That was an air base there. 
Q:   Okay. 

A:   But then I was only there a few days. Th
ey needed  someone in 
Fort Dix, New Jersey, 
so they shipped me back down  there, but I 
did get to go up th ere an
d see -- long train ride 
up to  Long Island. 

Q:   And at Fort Dix, 
that was still Air Force? 
A:   Yes, that was an Air Force base for B-17. 
Q:   For B-17s? 
A:   It also had Army there, too, I guess.  It
 was divided so rt of ha
lf and half.  They had 
this big airfield there. 
Q:   So if you were there for two years,
 how did you sp end your time?  What was a 
typical day like? 
A:   Well, it was a lot of drilling we did at tim
es.  We h ad to keep our
 physical -- keep in 
shape.  And then I work
ed in the supply center it was. 
 We had to  organize all of the 
equipment, and  wh en  a plane came in and needed a part, we had to get it and deliver it to 

them.  So that was ma
inly what I was doing, the technical supplies. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
22 
Q:   And that was two years? 
A:   Yes, two years about.  Maybe a little s
hort of two but -- because I spent a little over a 
year in Germany. 

Q:   So it was from April of '43, April '44, 
and then was it from Fort Dix that you left for 
Germany, that you left for Europe? 

A:   No.  Then I went to Texas.  They ga
ve me another six-week refresher on more like 
infantry training, you know, in case 
we would have to join the infantry. 
Q:   But you were still Air Force at that point? 

A:   Right.  More or less, right.  Uh-hum. 
Right.  And then they
 assigned me -- well, 
when the (?bomb?) came, then th
ey assigned me to the engineer battalion, 15th Engineer 
Battalion, right. 

Q:   So that's where the sw
itch came from Air Force to Army? 
A:   Right. 
Q:   Okay , and that's wh
en you were in Texas? 
A:   Right. 
Q:   Okay, and th
en  wh at h a pp ened ? 
A:   You see then -- well, then I get the 
order, I guess, I get to go home on a little 
vacation, or furlough they call 
it, and th en it's over to Boston, I guess, and we shipped out 

on Liberty Ship . 
Q:   Was that the first time you were in a big city? 
A:   Yes, it was. 

Q:   What kind of -- 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
23 
A:   Trenton.  Trenton was, 
I guess, yeah, would have been 
the biggest one.  I went there 
every weekend.  Oh , and th e fortunate thing, there the minister of our church th ere, 
Lutheran church, he was a classmate of my br
other in our high scho
ol, so I stayed with 
them once in a while on weekends. 
Q:   In Trenton? 

A:   Yes. 
Q:   Okay. 
A:   That was nice.  Imagine having so
meone from your hometow
n, you know, right 
there. Oh, and I had another experience.  Walk
ing the street -- this is unusual.  Walking 
the street one Saturd ay  night I passed the tave
rn and out of the tave
rn comes this man.  
I'm walking by, I'm going to hi
s house, the pastor's house, a
nd he says, "Hello, Marty," a 
man from my  hometown, and he's being shipped 
over to Germany real 
fast.  They had to 
leave immediately.  They all came out of that
 tavern and he said, "We've gotta go, we'r e 
leaving," and he ended up getting burned  -- he
 was a cook, and he 
got burned all over his 
face and his arms. 
Q:   Did he survive? 
A:   He carried the scars with him.  Right, 
uh-hum, yes, in PaullinA:  He worked in the 
grocery store.  But just seeing him, that wa
s unusual. That was one in a thousand maybe. 
Q:   And this was 
still in Trenton? 
A:   Yes. 
Q:   This was still in Trenton? 

A:   Right. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
24 
Q:   So from Texas you get shipped -- yo
u know that you're going over to Europe? 
A:   Right. 
Q:   You have a furlough to  say good bye.  Do
 you remember what that was like, being at 
home? 
A:   That was just -- oh, guess what?  I had to
 walk home.  It was in December.  I had to 
walk home in the middle of a snowstorm, a
nd I started walking from where I ended up on 
a train in a small town or something and here I'm walking in this cold  weather and here 

comes a sn owplow, and he recognized me fro
m Paullina, so he picked me up on the 
snowplow and brought me home,
 and that was wonderful. 
Q:   And your brother wasn't there? 

A:   No. 

Q:   Your older brother -- 

A:   No.  Brothers were gone.  You know, 
he was in Carolina and the other boy was -- the 
other boy probably hadn't quite gone
 yet.  He left after -- he was younger, so he probably  
went in the next year, maybe after I did so
... Let's see, w h ere are we?  Okay, then Œ 
Q:   We're at your parents and 
you're at home and it's before
 you leave for Europe, and do 
you have any memo ry of that good-bye trip? 

A:   Well, I  reme mb er my  mo th er mad e me my  
 special banana pie.  It was very touching.  
I mean, they took it quite well, I g u ess.  They
 said, "Well, the Lord
 will take care of 
things," you know, so -- right. 
Then I went to Boston, I told
 you, that's where we shipped 
out on th e Liberty Ship .  We actually loaded
 at night and when  we woke up the next 
morning, here we are out in
 the Atlantic Ocean with a 
hundred ship s, I would guess, 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
25 
around us, Liberty Ship s, all 
kinds of ships, a big marada -- what do they call it? 
Q:   Armada? 
A:   Armada of ships, yes, and then all of
 these cruisers going around, and th en we knew 
there was some problem, and then our captain 
told us, yes, they had sighted a submarine 
and they 're making sure that everything is se
cure.  So we could ha
ve been hit I suppose. 
Q:   Now, in Boston, y
ou were there for just -- 
A:   Just -- right.  It was so 
quick.  At night we loaded -- 
Q:   And then you were gone? 
A:   -- and then we were gone.  We were out. 
Q:   And do you rememb er the first time you saw European soil? 
A:   Yes.  It was -- here again I was sleepi
ng, and when  I woke up after the end of the 
journey, here we are in the middle of the E
nglish Channel and the bells they have out in 
the water was ringing, and that was the most 
beautiful sound even  though the war was not 
over yet, you know, not quite, and here we 
are sitting there and waiting to go ashore. 
Q:   Where did you land? 

A:   Lahar.  They  put us on a truck and then  
we  went to this first stopping point, some 
little town.  I remember we ended up th ere in 
a train -- first we took a train across French 
-- that's rig h t.  A___+. 

Q:   So wh en  did you -- do you rememb er the date you landed? 
A:   Yeah.  I've got it on my  record s, but let'
s see.  Oh, boy.  I think it was -- I think it was 
April again, somewhere around that time, April. 
Q:   April '45? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
26 
A:   Yeah.  Well Œ 
Q:   Or was it -- 
A:   I think it was April '45, yes. 
Q:   Because -- 

A:   It was very close.  I was close to it,
 but it was over when I got over there, right. 
Q:   So Ap ril of '45 you take a train across? 
A:   We were crossing France. 
Q:   And then wh at happened? 

A:   Then  they put us on a truck, an Army  tr
uck at some point, and then we went to this 
small town in Germany first, but
 we didn't stay there very  long.  Then we went to another 
little town for a while, Furstenfeldbruck or something and 
then we ended up going to 
Dachau. 

Q:   You were going to tell me so
mething about Battle of the Bulge. 
A:   Well, that's when they 
-- that's when I actually went, 
was drafted, you know.  Like, it 
switched over to the Ar
my from the Air Corps. 
Q:   Because of that battle? 
A:   Because of the Bulge. 
Q:   Because of the Bulge? 

 A:   That's why.  They n
eeded extra reserves 
just in case because that was a ser i ous 
point, so they were building up 
the forces to make sure that... 

Q:   Did it matter to you? 

A:   Not so mu ch, no.  I just took in struc tions -- I guess I was young enough to  take it in 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
27 
stride.  Now I think about it, 
you should have been
 a little bit afraid  maybe. Not really.  
Well, that's a normal thought, isn't it? 
Q:   Yes, it's very normal. 
A:   And I knew that a lot of my friends
 already -- one of my
 -- the fullback on my 
football team had been killed over in Germany.  He started out in Alaska, but he wanted 

to get into th e fighting, so they switched hi
m over to Germany, and he died th ere in the 
Bulge, I believe. 

Q:   Can you tell me, d o  you know how many 
boys from Paullina were drafted in the end, 
how many served in the ar
my  during World War II? 
A:   How many? 

Q:   Uh-h um. 

A:   From my class or -- 

Q:   From the town. 
A:   Oh, boy, let's see.  I w
ould bet there would be -- there were a lot of them.  I would 
say 20 or mo re.  20 or 
30 probab ly, right, yes. 
Q:   That's quite a 
lot for a small town? 
A:   Right, it was a lot.  Because I see the 
names now, you know, on 
the list that died, the 
Veterans, and there's a lot of them. 
Q:   And was he the only one y
ou know of who didn't survive? 
A:   Well, let's see now.  Yeah.  All the ot
hers were eith er killed in the war or they're 
gone.  In fact, you won't believe this, on 
my  football team, I'm the only one left. 
Q:   Oh, my.  Oh, my. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
28 
A:   And I was a center for the team, and everybody's gone. 
Q:   Well, tell me a little bit about some 
of the others that we
re killed in the war. 
A:   Well, this one was a fu
llback on our team. His fath er ra
n a grocery store in the town. 
And the other one was one of my  
best friends that played with
 us when we were children. 
Q:   What was his name? 
A:   He was in the infantry.  He was kille
d over there, too, somewhere.  I don't know 
exactly where. 

Q:   What was his name? 

A:   Wayne Poreman.  And then --well, th
ere was another one, Martin Poreman, another 
one, same thing, but he died late
r, though.  He survived the war. 
Q:   Okay. 

A:   Okay. 

Q:   I'm looking at those who died in battle or died in th e war. 
A:   There's another 
one on our team -- no, he didn't  di
e in the battle.  I would say there 
were just two that I remember, actually. 
Q:   Okay. 
A:   The rest, they made it b
ack.  My brother made it back, too.  My  younger brother from 
Belgium, he made it b ack. 
Q:   When  you had landed in France, do you
 remember y our first impressions of what 
you were seeing? 

A:   Gee.  Well, I remember when we were 
on th e train we were go
ing along and this one 
mu st have been a farmer, somebody, he waved 
at us and there, the people along the way 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
29 
were waving at us.  We had the big door open
, you know, so we could look out. And then 
the big experience is when we
 came through Munich.  And I think I mentioned in my  
letter that it had bombed, the ra
ilroad station there, and ther
e were hundred s of mailbags -
- did I tell you th at -- on the ground? 
Q:   Tell me now. 

A:   Hundreds of mail bags, you know, the hug
e -- and the letters were strewn all over.  I 
wish I had brought some of those letters with
 me, but ma ybe that wouldn't  have been the 
right thing to do, either.  But 
I did look at a few that were 
torn open.  It was from German 
mo thers sending pictures of their children 
to their husbands out 
on th e Ru ssian front. 
Q:   So you could read German and you
 could know what they were saying? 
A:   A little.  I got a few things out of there, 
right, that I could underst
and, that they were 
expressing their thoughts. 

Q:   What did you feel when you saw those? 
A:   That made a very -- not a hateful fee
ling and yet, you know, in between there that, 
yes, these are mothers that ar
e -- they may not have had anyt
hing to do with this mess 
here, you know, of Hitler and his...but that Œ 

Q:   What did you know about Adolph Hitle
r, because I'm trying to get a sense of how 
mu ch people knew in  the Un ited States, how
 much the guys in
 the Army knew? 
A:   Well, you know, they woul
d always talk about it and they
 would say a joke about it.  
They  would say, "Go get that guy."  And they
 gave him a name.  I can 't remember what it 
was.  It wasn't a good name.  "Go get him," that
's what they would say.  That's  about all I 
can remember. People will tell you, they didn
't follow it close enough either, you know, 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
30 
that it was going to  happen.  I 
don't think anyone really Œ 
Q:   Did you see during the time -- if you we
nt over in April of '45 and you're going 
through Fran ce and you end up in one sm
all German town and an other and then  
eventually through, did you see any battle?  
Did you see any corpses, did you see any -- 
A:   When  we went by this one bridge ther
e, there were bodies hanging over the railing. 
Q:   Was this in Munich? 
A:   As we passed through Mu
nich going on, there were bo
dies hanging over, and I saw 
one man standing on the bridge
, and he mu st have had co nvu
lsions or something because 
just imagine from that distan
ce I could see how he was cough
ing and spitting 
up blood or 
something, and it was just -- I 
remember that.  That must ha
ve made an impression on me 
seeing him there, but these bodies are Œ 
Q:   Were those the first bodies that you saw? 

A:   Yes, those are the first ones there -- 
Q:   Okay. 
 A:   -- hanging over.  And then -- but those 
mailbags, though, th at hangs with you.  You 
don't forget that, because, ooh, I 
wonder whatever happen ed to 
those, if they picked them 
up and... 

Q:   If they ever got delivered? 

A:   That's what I wonder.  It would have 
been  nice to have a couple of them, really, I 
could have given them to here. 
Q:   So you were passing th rough Munich? 

A:   Right. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
31 
Q:   And then where did you go? 
A:   All of these little towns.  First Wasse
rburg was another one, 
Furstenfeldbruck, and 
then we were in a wo
oded area somewhere, I don't know wh
ere that -- that was in Bavaria 
somewhere. And then one of th
e singers from America came over to entertain, one of the 
famous singers from the band, wh en they  had 
the bands, and I remember that. But then 
there was this little to wn.  I was -- at night I 
had to go to this little
 office andmake the 
roll call for the morning and things. 

Q:   That was going to be my  next que
stion. What was your job when you -- 
A:   That's what I did.  I was the mornin
g clerk, more or less, because there was no 
engineering work  to do yet, so they kept me
 over there.  And one night I was going there 
walking on the sidewalk and a 
big flowerpot fell about that 
far ahead of me, and I don't 
know if it was an accident, bu
t they did check it out the ne
xt day and they
 never found 
out anything about it. But otherwise I noticed
 this one young girl 
that lived across the 
street from where we were staying and she'
d always look out the window at us, you 
know, and she was kind of -- one day I saw 
her walking on the street, and I just said, 
"Hello Fräulein."  We weren't associated w
ith them, but she was so
 scared.  She just 
walked by real fast.  And th
ey were afraid to come out 
in a way in the daytime even 
though we wouldn't have done anything. 
Q:   So you felt a certain kind
 of distrust, a fear of you? 
A:   Right.  At times, right.  Otherwise th
e older folks many times, they'd  just ___+, but 
we didn't see too many of them, either.  Th
ey didn't usually -- not that many of them. 
Q:   So -- 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
32 
A:   Then I got to go see Ki
ng Lutheran's  Castle one week en
d.  That was a nice trip we 
took. 
Q:   In all of this, when do you eventually 
get to Dachau? 
A:   That was probably after Wasserburg and we
 loaded  up, and 20 of 
us, I think, were on 
this truck.  Or two trucks.  I th
ink there were five in each side. 
Q:   Do you know what 
you were supposed to do? 
A:   No. 
Q:   You were just told to -- 

A:   They didn't tell us anything, really.  
And here -- I think back
 on it now, here I am 
going in this peaceful countrysid
e of Bavaria and suddenly I'm 
going to be dropped off at 
a place where the most inhu
mane things happened. 
Q:   Tell us what happened.  Tell us what yo
u saw wh en you went there.  You're in these 
two trucks, about 20 guys. 
A:   Yeah.  Okay , we pull in there, at firs
t I don't see -- it looks like a peaceful city, you 
know.  Here we are on the ground area and I ge
t out -- we get out to stretch our legs, but 
the minute I turn, I'm facing that way and I see 
this boy, eight to ten years old, and he's 
talking to a soldier, and he has something in
 his hand, and I go -- na
turally I wanted to 
see what's going on there, and so I go over th
ere and I see the furnace immediately with 
the door open. 

Q:   So you're insi
de the camp already? 
A:   Yes, and th is was up by th e building 
where we were finally housed.  And he's 
showing these pictures, and he had them all 
-- in all stag es of 
being gassed and piled 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
33 
bodies and being brou
ght to the furnace. 
Q:   So they  were photographs of people? 
A:   Actual photographs. 
Q:   I wonder where he got them. 

A:   And wh ere he got those -- I wish he had 
-- and that boy disappeared that very day, I 
don't know -- when we were ca
lled to go ch eck in for our 
baggage and our housing, he 
was gone and ne
ver found him. 
Q:   Do you remember wh
at he looked like, how he was dressed?  What -- 
A:   He just had on regular pants and a shir
t and he was about -- a
nd that soldier bought 
these from him, the pictures.  I w o nder wh
ere he got them.  I think about it so many 
times, where did he get those pictures, but they were -- 

Q:   Did he look like he was a local 
boy from the town  who had come there? 
A:   That's what I'm -- I'm 
thinking he was either from Dach
au or he was from that thing 
that I called  the hospital.  Now, I'm not sure 
if that was the hospita
l back there, because 
on th e map that I was sent, it showed the ho
spital in a mo re area where there were all 
buildings around it, but that wasn 't the case w h ere I landed there. 
Q:   Well, tell me -- 
A:   Oh, by the way, that furn
ace door was open and I could se
e hair all over.  It was just 
filled. Big clumps. 
Q:   Did you -- so this was the first time 
you see what was going on in  Dachau , and what 
did you think? 
A:   Oh...I had read about it and heard, you kn
ow.  I said, well, here, look, I'm looking at 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
34 
where it actually happened here, you know, here 
it is.  I could see ashes in the furnace. 
Q:   Do you rememb
er the hair color? 
A:   What? 
Q:   Do you remember 
the color of the hair? 
A:   Gray.  Lots of gray hair.  And some we
re kind of black, you know
, but they were big, 
and the door was open.  And th
en I turned around
 the other way and there was the water 
tower, and it wasn't a typical water tower wh
ere you would get drinki
ng water from.  I'm 
sure it wasn't.  I'm sure it was a collecti
ng tower for water where they could perform 
those experiments that I read about, you know. 
Q:   Well, tell me what you had read, beca
use I was trying to get a sense of how mu ch 
you knew what you were going to see, and it se
ems that you didn't k
now that there were 
some things that were going on. 
A:   Yes. 
Q:   So wh en  was the first time you heard 
of what might have 
been  going on there? 
A:   That was months before I read in
 the paper and people talked about it. 
Q:   In the United States? 

A:   Yes.  We got -- well, we just heard ab
out it over there even. 
 We knew that it was 
going on, right. And that water tower, it had no top 
on it, either.  That made me think, oh, 
this is where they performed thos
e -- you know what they did, right? 
Q:   Well, I want you to tell me. 
A:   Okay. 

Q:   I would like for you to tell me what Œ 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
35 
A:   I read where they actually
 took them, the bodies, and put 
them in there alive to test 
how  long th ey could surviv e in the cold water. 
Q:   And how high was that water tower? 
A:   It wasn't -- well, it was probably -- th
e stands were probably ab out 8 feet and then it 

was maybe 10 feet tall, I would guess. 

Q:   So it wasn 't one of those water towers that's way up high? 
A:   No.  No.  It was one where there's pl
enty of water in there that would freeze and 
collect water from the rain and everything el
se, and I'm just sure that -- and I could 
visualize this area was perfect for this set up,
 because when I went to  the big -- then the 
other building th at was there, the huge warehous
e, I wish I knew th e whole history of that 
thing there, but when I first went there, ther
e's this entryway, and th
e first thing I see is 
these shelves filled with the 
jars, you know, with all the human
 parts of the body.  And I 
said -- 
Q:   Were they labeled? 
A:   What?  No, but I c
ould tell what they were. 
Q:   You could tell what they were? 
A:   You want me to name them? 
Q:   Yes. 

A:   Hands, complete hand, fingers, ears, eyes
, breast, a penis, liver, kidneys, intestines -- 
everything.  It sticks.  You'
re not going to forget that. 
Q:   Of course not. 

A:   I saw that and then I knew -- I says ri
ght away, well, this would be the spot maybe 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
36 
where -- this house where we'r e going to be st
aying, maybe there were doctors in there, 
you know, with a few SS troops because they 
had the angora hutch es there, two hutches 
with rabbits.  And I also read 
that they used that fur for th
e colors for their uniforms in 
there. And I don't know who fed those ra
bbits.  I never saw anyone feed them. 
Q:   And there were still live rabbits there? 
A:   Yes, there were rabbits in them.  And 
then  the big -- that bui
lding was so huge.  I 
think it was longer than a football field. 

Q:   Which building was this? 

A:   As you went thro ugh th e entryway  into
 a big warehouse behind it.  There was a big 
opening door and you go in  th
ere and that's where the tables were with all of these 

instruments that were manufactured, and I believe Œ 

Q:   What kind of -- I'm sorry, did I interrupt you? 

A:   I think the Holo caust victims might ha
ve made those.  But I saw no machinery in 
there at the time because we didn't get to st
ay there long enough.  We only saw the first 
table, but I'll bet there were 
a hundred tables in there. 

Q:   But tell me what kind of in
struments are you talking ab out? 
A:   Oh, there was compa
sses, plie rs.  Excuse me.  
Q:   That's okay. 

A:   Pliers, compasses, wren
ches, all kinds of drafting material.  Beautiful, beautiful 
things they were. And I wish
 I could have gone in -- an
d you know what happened the 
next day?  We never went in there agai
n, so I think the th
ing was locked up. 
Q:   Well, tell me -- let'
s step back a little bit. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
37 
A:   All right. 
Q:   What was the name of
 the town that you were in
 before -- Wasser something? 
A:   I think it was Wasserburg. 

Q:   Wasserburg, okay.  So 
wh en you're going from Wasser
burg and you're on a truck and 
you're being told you're 
going to go so meplace but you
'r e not being told wh ere? 
A:   Not really. 
Q:   Not really? 
A:   Uh-h um. 

Q:   Okay, and you're not told why, either -- 
A:   No. 
Q:   -- what you're
 going to  be doing? 

A:   No. 

Q:   And so your first impression is when 
you see this little boy and he's showing these 
photographs? 

 A:   Right. 

Q:   And wh en he shows the photographs, 
by that point do you know that you're in 
Dachau Concen
tration Camp? 
A:   Oh, definitely, yes.  We knew that. Right. 

Q:   And that's inside the camp.  So your tr
uck mu st have gone into
 some kind of fenced 
enclosure? 

A:   Yes.  It was -- well, it 
wasn't .  Then  did I tell you ab ou
t the wo men in that stockade 
that I mentioned. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
38 
Q:   I would like -- let's bring th at -- we'l l get to that, but I would like to get a sense of 
what you saw when  you got into
 the camp  and you're  on the road  and th en all of a 
sudden you're  so
mewhere else, and what was it that 
--  y ou know  wh
at did you see? 
A:   Well, first the boy, you know. 

Q:   Were there walls? 

A:   Oh, there, okay.  We were fenced in. 
 We got the building there and then there are 
trees. All around us there's tr
ees, so you don't see mu ch ot
her than the building that I 
mentioned and the water tower.  We're hemmed
 in.  And the Danube was right behind 
our build ing. 
Q:   So, in other wo rds, you've driven into  an
 enclosure?  The trucks have gone into an 
enclosed area? 
A:   More or less with the trees, if yo
u count the trees.  There was no fences. 
Q:   There were no fences? 
A:   No. 
Q:   Okay. 

A:   I wish I could spot it on that map, but I just can't find the location. 
Q:   That's okay.  That's okay.  And you get 
off of the truck and you see that there is this 
kid talking to one of the soldiers and 
th e soldier buys the photos from him?  
A:   Right. 

Q:   And then wh en you look arou
nd, you see -- what else do you see? 
A:   The tower.  I start tying ev erything togeth
er, and then that building with the annex to 
it with the shelves and all of the Œ 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
39 
Q:   There's no sign that says Dachau Concen tration Camp ? 
A:   No, no. 
Q:   By that point does somebody come to 
you and say why you'r e th
ere?  Do you figure 
out why you're supposed to be there? 
A:   Not even yet, no.  It took a few days 
and then finally one mo rn
ing the lieutenant said 
we're going to dig out here.  He put me in 
charge and we started digging so me holes for 
the posts. 

Q:   For posts? 

A:   Posts for a little stockade, I guess, we 
were going to build.  For whom I don't know.  
They didn't tell us that, either. 
Q:   So you're digging 
and there are 20 of you? 
A:   Right, about 20. 

Q:   And you're the one who is responsible for 
them to make sure th
at they dig properly? 
A:   Right, I was supposed to make sure th
at they did the digging.  I did some of the 
digging and the lieutenant said, "You don't have to do that, you're in charge of th is," but I 

kept digging anyway.  I like to work.  But th
en about two or three days later is when I 
saw that stockade in the other direction, an
d then all of a sudden all of these women 
appear looking through the fence, but you ca
n't see many build ings because of the trees 

again.  But then on this side you could see a 
little part of a building 
there, so maybe they 
were in that building the day befo re. 

Q:   Do you know who they were? 

A:   No. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
40 
Q:   Were they prisoners? 
A:   They were prisoners.  They were all dr
essed in these brown skirts and brown blouses. 
Q:   Did they look well fed? 

A:   Not real well, no.  They looked a little ha
ggard, but they had been
 fed, I'm sure, yes. 
They weren't -- nothing like th e Holocaust victims, I'm sure
.  I bet they were political 

prisoners or something. 
Q:   So they still had been  prisoners of the Germans? 
A:   Yes. 

Q:   It wasn't Germans who became prisoners? 
A:   No.  Evidently they were from diffe
rent countries becaus
e they looked a little 
different, not all alike. 
Q:   I see. 

A:   I wish I knew who they were, but then we
 lost track of them.  They were gone again 
after a while.  Maybe they left at night or so
mething. That camp was weird in a way that 
there were ghosts there.  There was no traffic 
in or out after we came
.  I can 't remember a 
single truck or anything coming in. And th e peop
le at that hospital, that I call a hospital, 
about a hundred yards down 
the line from our building, all I saw there -- we weren 't 
supposed to go there either -- were nurses 
evidently because they 
had the wh ite unifo rms 
on, and I felt, well, ma ybe they 're nursing so
me of these Holo caust victims who couldn't  
move or be transferred. 

Q:   Did you see -- but you saw -- you saw -- you saw former concentration camp inmates 

as well? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
41 
A:   Yeah. 
Q:   Where did you see those, those people? 
A:   No.  They were down 
there.  Sometimes you would s
ee one come out, I think.  I'm 
sure they were because we couldn't tell fr
om a distance, but I assumed they were. 
Q:   I guess part of me is a little co nfused 
because I always pictured that Dachau as a 

concen tration camp had to be en closed 
because otherwise people would escape. 
A:   Oh.  Hum. 

Q:   But that 's not what you saw? 

A:   Not our area, no. 
Q:   Okay. 
A:   Unless the Army  removed it, you know, 
but I doubt that.  But they had removed all 
of the bed and th ings, I'm sure, from all the tr
ains and everything.  
We didn't see any of 

that. 
Q:   What date was it that you entered? 
A:   This was a little later.  I think we came 
there in June and then 
we stayed into July.  
So it was over a month after they had been cl
eared. But that's what 
I figured was going on 
down there at that hospital, that
 th ey were treating survivors. 
Q:   They were treating su rvivors? 

A:   Yeah, and that would fit in perfectly there. 
Q:   Now, had you -- but you didn't 
meet any survivors?  You didn't -- 
A:   No.  No. 
Q:   No? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
42 
A:   No.  You didn't see an
ybody except we were the only
 ones there.  No German, 
nothing.  It was weird in a way.  Th
at boy, that 's about the only one. 
Q:   What did he look like?  Was he blonde? Was he -- 
A:   He was sort of brown, a mix in a little 
blondish, if I can remember correctly.  And I 
did know a little German, so I th
ink I said, "Vater and Mutter," 
and then he been pointed, 
you know, I think, is how I go
t that message that he -- but 
I wonder what happened to 
him. 

Q:   Did he -- 

A:   Well, they wanted us to
 get organized in  our place wher
e we were going to stay, so 
they took us away.  And th
e same thing happened from the 
big building.  We didn't go 
back there again, either. That 
was locked up.  Mayb
e they didn't want us to see in there 
anymore. 

Q:   What was the place where 
you stayed?  What was that? 
A:   It was a brick building. 

Q:   It was a brick building? 

A:   With individual rooms, with a cafete
riA: You know, I don 't even remember eating a 
meal there, but look at all I 
remember about the first day. 
Q:   Of course. 

A:   I don't remember eating a single meal th ere. 
Q:   But you had to have eaten? 
A:   I can 't  remember sitting down
 to eat. Nothing.  It's  all go
ne, but that first day is right 
there 100 percent.  And even  the second and th
ird day.  Well, that one weekend we went 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
43 
to the Danube, wading and swimming in th e wa
ter.  These girls -- I 
told you about that. 
Q:   Tell me again. 
A:   They came from D
achau, I think, and at the time I gue
ss they were 17, 18 years old, 
so I -- they would put on th eir bathing suits and 
stand there and kind of wave at us, but all 
of a sudden we would wave or something an
d then th ey would go 
back and have their 
coats on quick.  They  did that two or three 
times.  They would switch back and forth and 
then they  were gone, and we just
 wadded in  the water there.  
It was kind of -- cool off in 
July. 
Q:   It was hot. 
A:   But I assumed that before Hitler that 
that was their place wher
e they could come on 
the weekend and go in the water. 
Q:   So you think th ese 
were local town girls? 
A:   Yes. 
Q:   From the 
town of Dachau? 
A:   From Dachau. 
Q:   From Dachau town? 
A:   I'm sure there were about eight of them
, I think.  They hid behind th e brush.  There 
were narrow bushes there and they sort of -- 
Q:   So it sounds kind of isolated.  Like
 you 20 guys were kind of isolated there. 
A:   We were.  Yes, w e were.  Well, we were setting up home there for a while.  It was 

weird. It really was. 

Q:   And somebody told  you to go dig those holes. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
44 
A:   Right. 
Q:   So did you meet other U.S. m
ilitary people in the camp at the time? 
A:   No.  We were the only ones. 

Q:   Who was it that told you to dig this stuff? 

A:   The lieutenant, our lieutenant. 

Q:   Who had come with you on the trucks? 
A:   Right.  He's in charge.  He was in ch
arge of setting everything up.  The cook was 
there and we had the cook, and it was really
 something. But those ladies, too, on th e 
camp, I don't know wh at happened to them.  
They  took them out at night and th ey moved 
them because we never saw them again, bu
t it was like ghosts were there in a way. 
Q:   How did you feel that? 

A:   What? 

Q:   In what way did you feel like it was ghosts? 
A:   Well, that's why I think 
I buried those tools, by the way. 
Q:   Tell me about the tools that you found. 
A:   Yeah.  I found those and there were abou
t four of them, pliers and co mp ass and a few 
other thin gs. 

Q:   Excuse me that I'm interrupting,
 but where did you find them?  Tell us. 
A:   They were out on the groun
d.  They were sort of laying 
in a rag thing in plastic, and I 
picked th em up, and I don't know why I didn't -- 
when I was a kid, I always buried things.  
And I do it now with  our kids.  We buried th
e box in our garden .  
We still haven't dug it 
up ag ain.  So  I think that's why I did it, was to 
sort of put this whole thing to rest, as if I'm 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
45 
burying what happened here.  I think I did that
 maybe.  And if I coul
d be there, I possibly 
could find it.  I don't know, though.  Those tr
ees were awful large then already, and I 
didn't  bury very deep
.  About that deep. 
Q:   Where do you rememb er having 
buried them? Was it under a tree? 
A:   Yes, it was by the tree.  About that fa
r away from the tree.  
And the ground was a 
little hard, but I got them cove
red up about that high maybe. 
Q:   By "that high," you're talking about 
how many?  About a foot, about 8 inch es? 
A:   Yeah, about 
8 inch es probably . 
Q:   About 8 inches. 
A:   And I leveled it off sort of nice.  I 
don't think any of the ot
her guys knew that I 
buried them. 
Q:   Did other guys find th ings? 

A:   I don't know.  One man -- I don't think they
 did.  No, I don't th
ink they did, because 
none of th em ever told me anything about that. 

Q:   Did you guys talk amongst one another ab out wh at you saw? 

A:   Not much of that either, no. 
Q:   Really? 
A:   No.  Well, I mean, this one man, when 
I went up there, we talked about -- we were 
shaking our heads and we were getting nerv ous and we couldn't believe this boy, that 
young boy there, but that was te
rrible, but then we were told
 not to go -- oh
, yeah, not to 
go over to those ladies over there.  One guy 
wanted to go over there 
and go and talk to 
them, oh, no, no, you better not, you'll get in 
trouble. I don't know wh
y we couldn't  go to 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
46 
that hospital down there. 
Q:   So you were just told
 to stay away
 from things? 
A:   Uh-h um. 

Q:   And the building where you went wh ere yo
u found the jars with all the human parts, 
did you go there again? 

A:   I would have.  I would have loved to
 go way in deep  ther
e, but it was closed 
evidently because we never went in there ag
ain, and I know I would have gone in, and I 
don't remember -- because
 I know we couldn't go in there again. 

Q:   Who would have closed it?  Your lieutenant? 
A:   Probably the lieutenant maybe got orders
 or someone from the other area there at the 
hospital ma ybe was in charge or so mething. 
 I don't know.  I wonder where all of those 
tools ended up. That just bothers me somethi
ng terrible.  What happened to th at?  Why -- 
and who was feeding the rabbits
?  It was just a puzzle. 
Q:   And you never saw any corpses? 
A:   No. 

Q:   By that time in June th
ere were no more corpses or -- 
A:   No.  Everything was -- but that furn
ace showed me enough
, though, about what 
happened  th ere.  And why there was only one 
furnace, that would be
 perfect, though, for 
experimentation, wouldn't it?  They only 
needed one because they would take an 
individual -- they even  inoculated some of th
em with bad diseases an
d then th ey disposed 
of the bodies, I would 
imagine, right there. 
Q:   When you had read this 
stuff back still in the states th
at there were things like this 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
47 
going on, do you reme mb er how you reacted? 
 Was it kind of like disbelief or was it Œ 
A:   I think it was more disb
elief than anything.  Who coul
d do that, you know?  I mean, 
you start hearing about enough 
of it, you know, and you say, 
well, how can our people be 
doing that? Here we have the ancestry
 sort of and, you know, how can... 
Q:   You asked yourselves
 these kinds of questions? 
A:   What? 
Q:   Did you ask yourselve
s those kind of questions? 
A:   Sort of, yes.  And th
en, you know, the people they sa
y there in Daubner, they said 
they didn't know this was going on, but that
's impossible.  They had to know th is was 
going on. The smoke was in the... 
Q:   Did it smell funny when  you were there? 

A:   No.  That seemed to be 
quite gone, but I'm just sure -- 
I read about that also, how th e 
smoke was drifting terrible.  I'
m sure it's in all those places
. But I can say that there was 
no fence around us but these trees hemmed us 
in.  We were hemmed in and we just never 
-- and why we were given a pass to get out of 
there, I don't think that anybody ever left 

the camp other than the Danube River th
ere a little bit.  Where would you go? 
Q:   Exactly. 

A:   Where would I go?  I don't want to go
 to Dachau.  Who knows?  There might be a 
sniper there. 
Q:   I turned it off because I sneezed. You're saying it was weird, huh. 
A:   That really was.  We didn't really
 go -- want to go anywhe
re.  I don't know where 
you would go. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
48 
Q:   It is strange.  So y
ou're there, you're isolated, 
and you're there for how lo ng? 
A:   I would guess it's probably  
three weeks at least.  I th ink so. 
Q:   And your job was to build a stockade? 
A:   Yeah, right.  And then all of a sudden
 after we just leave it unfinished, too.  I 
remember that:  It wasn't finished. 

Q:   Well, what did it look 
like?  How mu ch had you built? 
A:   We just had some posts in there.  A
nd the holes took a long time to dig, you know, 
because it was all by hand and shovel.  We didn
't  have the equipment,
 you know.  That's 
all we did.  I think we had ab out three or 
four of those holes dug, and, oh, we'r e going. 
Q:   And that was it? 

A:   That was it.  On that map, though, it has 
to be one of the corner
s up in  that map there, 
I think is wh ere it is, where the river goes along, and th at has to be the spot. 

Q:   Tell me how did that -- did it change? Di
d you feel like it changed you when  you saw 
this stuff? 

A:   Yeah, I think so .  I mean, I can't imagin
e people doing -- it's ju
st -- I mean, you pray 
to the Lord about 
it, you know, how could this happen. 
Q:   And did you wh ile you were there? 

A:   Oh, yes, a lot.  I p ray today that it 
never happen again.  Humanity to man, it's 
something -- even though I was 
young, I mean, you had that -- 
it's even more
 now.  Now 
you realize, you know, what it was really.  It
 builds on you. It builds up th e older you get. 
Q:   Do you think having seen something firs
thand it brought it home to you in  a way th at 
if you'd only read about it, it
 would have been  different? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
49 
A:   I think so, oh, yes.  When  I saw that 
furnace, you know, and that door open with that 
hair, and that boy, those pictur
es, then you knew what you kn
ew, that that was Dachau.  I 
mean, that was -- I think 
that 's w hy during that
 -- the more I think about it now, I'm glad I 
did that.  I sort of buried the inhumane things
 I did there in that hole.  That's the feeling 
that I have. 
Q:   Those instruments that you burie
d, you said there were four pieces? 
A:   About four.  Four or five. 
Q:   Do you rememb
er what they were? 
A:   Yeah.  Well, I told you. 
 One was a compass sort of - - 
Q:   Oh, that's right. 

A:   -- a protractor and a wrench
, I think, and pliers maybe and... 
Q:   And do you think those were things
 that prisoners mi ght have made or -- 
A:   I really  do.  I think so.  I mean , I th
ink they  were made by -- I'm sure they would 
unless this was a staging area where they bro ught all the tools.  Bu
t why would they bring 
them there and then  ship them out or -- I don't 
know.  It just doesn 't seem right, but it was 
a huge warehouse so it could be 
used for something like that. 
Q:   So instead of the first day when you sa
w the warehouse and it had all kinds of tables 
and tools on it and items and things like that
, it was similar to wh
at you saw in that 
warehouse, those four th
ings that you buried? 
A:   Yes, yes, oh, yes, plus a lot of others
 probably  if I could have gone in th ere and 
looked at the other hundred tables.  Oh, 
there was -- you could see all the shiny -- you 
know, every table was filled, just filled.  An
d that was -- it was as lo ng as a football field 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
50 
I know. 
Q:   Did you meet anybody Jewish while
 you were in Muni
ch  o r  in  D a ch au ? 
A:   Let's see.  I think in 
that one town, maybe, one little 
town where we were up in a 
room and there is a boy -- a couple of boys 
that always came down, I think th ey were 
Jewish.  They always came down. 

Q:   What time was this? 
A:   Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Fu rstenfeldbruck 
maybe or one of those.  He'd  come up to -- 
this one man had met them before we got th
ere, and the boys would come up there and I 
would ask them about school a
nd things, and he spoke a little E
nglish, too.  They talked 
in English, I guess, a lot of them.  That's th
e only time, though, th at I think that I really 
came in contact. 
Q:   So when  you guys were taken out from 
there, you still didn't talk  about it much with 
one another, those Œ 
A:   No.  I can 't remember.  I'll b et we did. I 
ju st can 't r ememb er.  I 'm 
just sure we did, or 
unless we tried to put it all out of our minds, 
but I don't think so.  I think we talked about 
it, yeah.  I'm sure we did, yeah. 

Q:   Where did you go from there? 
A:   Then  I ended up in another wooded area, 
I think it was, where we had just barracks.  
There was no real head quarters or anything.
  It was just in the woods, because I 
remember spending a lot of days just s
itting on a log in the woods and I remember 
thinking, well, where am I 
going to  be 50 years from now. 
Q:   Really? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
51 
A:   I remember I thought that, saying here  I am in Germany, the war is over now and I 
wonder what's going to happen now,
 what my life will be, you know. 
Q:   Can you tell me w h ere -- do you rememb
er the mo ment you heard that the war had 
ended? 
A:   Well, let's see.  Oh, yes, yes.  Where were we?  Oh, boy, that was -- we were 

counting -- I'll tell you, I can't exactly.  It's unbelievable. 
Q:   But when you landed in Fran
ce, the war wasn't over yet, was it? 
A:   No.  Well, we must have heard.  It must
 have been th e real ha
ppy mo ment right then.  
It had to be, but I don't know.  I just
 can 't put my finger right on it exactly. 
Q:   Did you ever -- from the time you landed 
in Europe, the bells that you heard in the 
water and th en in Le Havre wh
ere you landed, did you ev er fe
el like you were in danger? 
A:   Yes, I did.  When we were on the trai
n there even we heard some sniper shots, rifle 
shots coming over, and we can still Œ 

Q:   Okay, so the 
war wasn't over then? 
A:   No.  No.  They said, "Oh, boy, there'
s snipers out there, you keep  moving."  So we 
kind of got inside the car a 
little more, you know.  I was ev
en a little scared in Munich 
when  I got out of there on the tracks there, you know. 
Q:   And you saw ___+. 

A:   Right.  A little bit.  Well, it's an 18
-, 20-year-old fear, I guess.  I guess we'r e a little 
brave at that time, in some ways we are, but 
you do have a feeling.  And then  I think back 
now when I walked in  some of
 those woods there, what if 
they hadn 't  cleared all the 
mines up?  I never thought about them but now I do. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
52 
Q:   Exactly. 
A:   You know, and even at Dachau .  And 
I often think with Dachau, I wonder if I'm 
standing on ground where people spen
t the last moment of their lives. 
Q:   Very possibly. 

A:   That's what I was -- that bothers me a 
lot.  I'm thinking my  
feet stood right there 
where someone maybe was spending their last fi
ve minutes on this earth.  And I was even 
thinking wh en we were digging
 there what if they had been
 buried there, but no sign of 
anything. 

Q:   Did any of your superior 
officers engage in conversations
 or explanations as to what 
Dachau was?  Anybody 
from U.S. military afterwards or dur
ing talk with a
ll of you guys 
who were there? 

A:   Not really.  No, they di
dn't.  They  didn't express any -- 
too much -- a lot of this -- you 
know, it's gone.  I don't want to say that they 
didn't  because that woul
d be very important.  
I'm sure we did. 

Q:   But it sounds like so mu
ch of what was going on a
nd from the memories, it was a 
vacuum of information. 
A:   It was.  Well, they don't tell y ou a whol
e lot, that's true.  We
 did not know what we 
were going to do there for a while, no.  And th
ey didn't  tell us about -- well, I guess they 
assume we all knew wh at happened, but he di
dn't warn us or anythi
ng, you know, to be 
careful.  I can't remember him telling us to be
 careful.  But those th
ings bother me. I wish 
I could have even have gone to that hosp
ital there, you know, talked  to people there. 
There I bet I would have met 
some survivors.  I'm sure.

Beginning of File Two 
A:   And they didn't tell them about -- I 
guess we assume d we all 
knew what happened, 
but he didn't warn us or anyt
hing, you know, to be careful. 
 I can 't remember him telling 
us to be careful.  But those things bother me.  
I wish I could have even
 have gone to th at 
hospital there, you know, talked
 to people there.  There I bet I would have met some 
survivors. 
Q:   Yes. 

A:   I'm sure.  But we just never got the 
opportunity to  do that. And going in  the big 
warehouse again, I would have 
loved to have gone in ther
e and see if there were any 
machines in there, the 
back part of it, where they could 
have been wo rking, you know, to  
produce those, because I'm sure 
they did use a lot of the Holo
caust people to -- you know, 
they did work, made them work. 
Q:   Were you -- afterwards, in kind of retr ospect, were you su rprise
d that you were sent 
to  D ach au ? 
A:   Yeah, I mean, it w as -- right, it hit me
 rig h t away, you know, and I knew what had 
happened there, yes, right, and we rea
lly didn't do a whole lot there, did we? 
Q:   A couple of posts? 

A:   But look what we saw.  Enough to make
 you get the full impact. 
 I almost got the full 
impact of what happened.  I 
can visualize now what was going
 on in the rest of the camp, 
you know, where they  really ha
d all of those -- one place th
ey said they had a hundred  
rabbit hutches, I guess.  They mu st have gone Œ 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
54 
Q:   Do you remember
 about how many rabbits 
there were in there? 
A:   Here at my place is about fo ur is all, but inside on the map it sh owed  these hutch es.  
Man, they had them all built together or th
ey must have had a lot going on with them.  
And that's where most of the people were, 
I guess, the victims, weren 't they, in the 
barracks and a huge section in the middle, 
and parts there were no barracks around our 
area either other than that one 
I showed you. You know, that 's 
all we could see is part of 
it, and there may have been some beyond that but the trees hid everything. 
Q:   Well, the brick building 
that you were staying in, do 
you know what that was used 
for before during the time th ere was a concentration camp? 
A:   I assumed it might have been  used ev en 
by the SS or the doctors.  It was a perfect 
setup for that. 
Q:   For medical experiments? 

A:   Right, I would say so.  There were se
parate rooms, you kn
ow, where they  had -- 
where they put them.  And then
 the cafeteria, there was a little 
place for an eating areA:  I 
would say it was a perfect setup, everything, 
and with the water tower and the display on 
the end, everything tied in together. 
Q:   When you went back -- skipping ahead 
here a little bit, when
 you went back to 
Paullina, did you tell people about what you saw? 
A:   You know, I didn't say too much.  Now 
I'm telling mo re, and now they're all asking 
me when they found out, you 
know, that I went on that H
onor Flight, now they 're saying, 
"You mean you were there," but they say most 
people don't talk -- they
 didn't  t alk about 
their World War II experience. That's why they
're doing these other _, I guess, people are 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
55 
opening up a little more now. 
Q:   Tell us about your Honor Flight because
 I think people wouldn'
t know about it.  Tell 
us what that is. 

A:   Well, they want to get everyone ther
e befo re they're gone, you know, and passing 
away. Wh at is it, a thousand a day or mo re? 

Q:   You mean Œ 
A:   The World War II Veterans. 
Q:   Who wants to -- and what are 
the Honor Flights?  What are they? 
A:   It's a group -- one man -- actually, the ra
dio station announcer, he
 got people to give 
money fo r this and someone organized it is th
e president of the gro
up now, and he gets 
the money, collects it, and when  they have en ough, th ey se
nd another group, and th ey're 
almo st through in our area now. 

Q:   And they send them where? 
A:   To Washington here. 
Q:   To Washington? 

A:   To see the monument, mainly the Wo
rld War II and the other mo numents, all of 
them, right. 

Q:   So little by little all World War II vets can 
come to Washington to
 be able to see -- 
A:   You know what they should
 include in that is this muse
um right here.  I wish they 
would do that. 

Q:   So when you were on the trip here, yo
u started telling some of the people you were 

with about Dachau? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
56 
A:   Oh, yes, a lot.  In our
 co ngregation, I brought it up at Sunday  school.  At Bible class 
meeting I brought it up and told  them.  Yes, 
I mentioned it.  Anothe
r friend of mine, he 
wants to get together with me
, he wants me to tell him.  
Q:   What about your folks, your parents, your
 brothers, your sister; did you talk about it 
when you got home? 

A:   My brother said, too, "I didn't know a
ll that," he says, "Why didn't you tell?"  But 
they just say we haven't talked about enough 
things, even what happ
ened in the war, you 
know.  Right, that 's w hy we'r
e doing these Ho nor Flights.  
I mean, you're gettingpeople 
to open up. And they  
even asked these questions there 
wh en we were in Washington in  
May.  You know, "Where were 
you, wh at did you 
do"?  Now they 'r e starting to open up 
more, and that's what
 we need, isn't it? 

Q:   Of course. 

A:   But how anyone can deny it is beyond me
. Like Iran, is that one of them denying it? 
Q:   Yes, that's right. 

A:   Unbelievable.  So I'll be doing a lot 
of talking now, I think.
  I'm going to  tell my  
pastor about it and get him to express it to
 the people. I know he mentioned it in his 
sermon already, too, about what
 the nation has gone through. 

Q:   Tell me, after you had left Dachau, wh
at were -- how much longer were you in 
Germany? 
A:   Well, let's see, after Da
chau, okay, let's see.  Okay, Ju
ly -- man, I was there another 
five, six, seven -- about seven months after that. 
Q:   In one place or Œ 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
57 
A:   A couple of different places.  Like th
ose wooded -- where we would just shift from 
one to another there sort of. 
Q:   And what were the things -- what did you do? 
A:   There wasn't a whole lot to do, believe 
me.  It was kind of a bad time.  You know, 
you were waiting for your points to p
ile up so you could go home, you know. 
Q:   What does points mean? 
A:   It went on the point system.  You had 
to have 35 I th ink -- y
ou got so many for each 
month in  the service. 
Q:   Okay. 
A:   And that all entered in.  When you went 
in, you had to  have three years, I think, so I 
hit that mark, and then
 when I went over it, I guess then
 they put me up -- as we were 
going -- going home, another one was coming th
e other way, occu pation forces, they 
passed us.  But wh en  we were going to France
, too, another one went the other way, they  

were coming home already.  
Even though the wa
r wasn't  over, they  were going back. 
Q:   I see. 

A:   They  may have been woun
ded, you know, wounded soldier. 
Q:   So did you stay ar
ound southern Germany? 
A:   It was all Bavaria, right, 
and I shipped off from Bremerhaven. 
Q:   Which is pretty far north? 
A:   Right, way up north, on a 
South American ship they 
borrowed from South AmericA: 
Q:   Did you have any kind of co ntact 
with the Germans while
 you were there? 
A:   I tried to talk to one of them once,
 but he couldn't understand my  German.  I said, 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
58 
"Wie heist dieser stadt." 
Q:   That sounds pretty clear. 
A:   Not too bad, was it? 
Q:   That's right. 

A:   Okay , and he didn't know -- by the way, 
that's a time when  we were staying in a little 
house.  I didn't mention that.  We were in so
me German  house.  We took over someone's 
house, I guess.  I don't know where they were
, they weren't there.  A  little plane landed, a 
Piper cub landed right in the field behind th
eir house, and they came -- I don't know who 
that was, either, but that's the house where 
I was outside on the ground, I found this nice 
picture of that SS that you have, I found th
at laying there, so I picked that up. 
Q:   And you sent us a picture of Œ 

A:   You got one of those, yes.  It's  a beauty
. I hate to say it -- well, it's a clear picture of 
the SS sniper, I think it was.  It's in there.  I think you have it. 
Q:   All right. 
A:   It's a sniper, I believe. 

Q:   Well, I'll take a look later.  I don't recall if it Œ 
A:   Oh, there's a map. 
Q:   There's a map. 

A:   Let me see.  I had the corner spotted, 
I think.  Let's see.  Where was that river now? 
Let's see.  I sure had it spotted 
one -- let's see. This?  No.  Th
is isn't the river up here, is 
it? 

Q:   I don't think so. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
59 
A:   No. 
Q:   It looks too straight a line to me. 
A:   No.  Let's see.  Beng -- no, that wouldn 't
 be it, either, then.  
But I know it was on one 
of the corners, I'm sure.  It was o n  one of the corners.  It was on one of the corners, I 
know.  I would say somewhere up in 
that areA:  You see all this h ere? 

Q:   Yes, that looks Œ 
A:   We weren 't anywhere near this.  We had trees, trees. 
Q:   So when you talk about 
Dachau, do you mean 
the town of Dachau 
or do you mean Œ
A:   The camp. 
Q:   -- the camp?  You mean the camp? 
A:   Oh, yeah. 

Q:   Even if 
it's still trees? 
A:   It's the camp, right.  Uh-hum.  Yup. 
 We were right on -- uh-hum, on the corner.  I 
don't know how big the town  of Dachau is.  I 
don't know exactly.  It's not huge.  It's not 
large.  It's 
just a little... 

Q:   It's now a suburb of Mu
nich.  Munich has in the deca
des after the war grew enough 
that it may not be exactly part of
 the city, but it's so close to 
it, considered so close to it. 
A:   Didn 't they make all the people go to Da
chau to see?  I think they went along to  pass 
through there, I think. 
Q:   I know Boek enbon had that. 
A:   I think I heard something 
about that, that 
they did that. 

Q:   So after that you stayed in sout
hern  Germany and when
 did you sh ip out? 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
60 
A:   I think it was April. 
Q:   April '46? 
A:   '46, and then I ended up in  New Jersey
 again somewhere, and then train to Fort 
McCoy, Wisconsin, where we'r e living now in 
Wisconsin.  I didn't think we would be 
living th ere, but we moved from Iowa, and th en
 I got discharged ther
e in probably about 
a week and... 

Q:   And you went home? 
A:   Discharged home, right.  I took th e trai
n and they  picked me up about 20 miles from 
home.  I could onl
y get within 20 miles because our 
train didn't run anymore in our little 
town. 

Q:   I see. 

A:   I used to deliver papers from ther e, from the train, but they closed it up. 

Q:   So your folks 
came to pick you up? 
A:   Right, came to pick me up, an
d that was a joyous mo ment there. 
Q:   I can imagine. 

A:   We all made it home, all three of us. 
Q:   And your parents, did they  ask you
 about your impressions of Germany? 
A:   Yeah.  They said, "Well, where we
re you?" you know.  They  hadn't had the 
education that we had, you know, so they 
were a little behind on
 that, but they knew 
enough ab out it.  And my  father says, "We
ll, I was way up th ere and you didn't get up 
there," he said, and I said, "Yeah, but I 
shipped out from Bremerhaven," and he knew 
about that. 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
61 
Q:   He knew wh ere Bremerhaven was? 
A:   Yes.  And he had all his brothers came 
from there.  You know, two -- oh, one of his 
brothers was even a soldier in -- who was 
it that Germany had before Hitler?  W as it 
king, was it? 

Q:   Oh, no, it was a ch ancellor. 

A:   Chancellor, yeah.  He wa
s in his army .  He had his wh
ole uniform with that point on 
the top. 

Q:   Oh, really? 

A:   With that old, blue uniform
.  He was in that army, I guess. 
Q:   Well, the Prussian king, Kaiser Wilhelm. 

A:   That's it I'll bet.  It was Wilhelm, yeah
. He was in that uniform, but he didn't -- well, 
he was older.  He didn't go into 
World War II then. My father... 
Q:   In general, in what way do you thin
k your Army  experience -- did it change you?  
Did it shape you in some way? 

A:   Well, in a way I always say to myself 
it was a great experien
ce for me, in a way it 
was, to grow up, you know. 
Q:   You felt like you grew up in the Army ? 
A:   More about the world, right, what people
 are like.  R ead, write.  I often say, well, it 
was kind of tough at times, but I wouldn't want 
to give it up.  It was a valuable thing.  It 
really was. Learning to live under cert
ain conditions and the 
way you had to eat 
sometimes and training was ev
en dangerous at night.  Wh
en it rained and poured in 
Texas, then our tent blew over, our pop-up
 tent blew away, and we didn't  know what 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
62 
would happen. We got soaked, you know.  Wake
 up in the mo rning and they  served you 
some oatmeal and it's  raining an d, I'll tell 
you, it was -- and then  you had to crawl under 
the wire fence during the m
achine gun shooting over you. 
Q:   Is this during training? 
A:   Yes, during training.  Th
e only mission -- well, they were 
pretty close.  They tried to 
make it realistic and you had to keep low, 
keep your head down. Well, I really hope I 
answered a lot of your things. 

Q:   I think so.  I think so.  I appreciate Œ 

A:   There's a lot of things that I wish 
I just knew mo re about, you know, like what 
happened  to  that boy Œ 

Q:   That's right. 

A:   -- where he came from, and those tools,
 what happened to all that and who made 
them, and why didn't we fini
sh that what we started. 
Q:   A lot of unanswered questions. 

A:   Right, and what happened 
to  those wo men over there in that prison, why didn't we 
see them stockade -- or when 
did they come, why didn't we 
know more about that?  Huh. 
Q:   I think those are terrific questions.  I me
an, it's  sort of like you see something and it 
stays a mystery until you ha
ve an answer for it. 
A:   Right. 
Q:   And here you were in a place for about
 six or seven weeks and there was no one who 
answered all of these mysterious Œ 

A:   Right.  But I've put it all together my se
lf now and I'm so sure
 that's what was going 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
63 
on there.  It was a perfect setup for that. 
Q:   For the medical ex periments? 
A:   Right.  When  I looked at those jars, you 
don't have parts like that on display if you're 
just a hospital or something.  I wonder why they
 left them there.  I was surprised at that. 
Q:   Were there like hundreds of jars? 
A:   Oh, there were at least 20 or more, 30.  
I would say at least three shelves.  I can just 
see them as if I'm looking at them right now.  And you wouldn't have that on display 

unless it was something unusual, like, why did th
ey leave them there?  Maybe that's why 
they locked the building. Mayb
e somebody came through.  I don't know.  I wonder if this 
area where I was if it even is a vis
itor's place now.  I wonder if it is. 
Q:   Have you ev er been  back ? 

A:   No. 

Q:   You've never been back to Dachau? 
A:   No.  Never went back.  That would be so
rt of interesting, but my age and my health 
isn't quite up to that anymore.  I would start digging if I was there. 
Q:   Maybe you would recognize where 
you were in relationship to the camp ? 
A:   Right.  I think if the furnace was still 
there, I can spot the place, I believe.  I know 
just about where I went from there. 

Q:   It sounds like Dachau was one of t
hose mo ments that stays in your memo ry like 
where you were when  Pearl Harbor was attacked? 

A:   Right.  Well, it did, because I told you I 
don't remember what I ate.  I can 't picture a 
single meal.  I don't know when  I went to bed, ho
w I slept.  It's  all gone.  And mo st of the 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
64 
days are just a blank, but that first day and th
at other day when  I saw that other thing, the 
wire enclosure, those things stuck.  And th en
 the girls at the rive
r, you know, because the 
first time I saw anyhuma
ns other than us.  Bu t I think there were only about 20 of us, that 
was it. 
Q:   Have you kept in touch with  a
ny of those others w
ho were with you? 
A:   No.  We never got addresses.  We sh
ould have done that. 
 A lot of groups get 
together. They do.  They're pr
obably all gone now, though. If 
they were a year older, they 

might have -- I shouldn't laugh ab out that -- I di
dn't  laugh, but there aren't many of them 
around an ymore.  I don't think so. 
Q:   Well, I appreciate that you have shar
ed your th oughts and your memo ries with us 
today. Is there anything else
 that you would like to add? 
A:   Well, I think I've covered it pretty well, 
I think.  I just wish we could have talked 
with mo re people though, you know Œ 
Q:   I can imagine. 
A:   -- the victims.  Never got to.  Never di
d. The ones that survived
 were gone from us.  
They  were gone, taken care of 
evidently. And I didn't know ab ou
t that march, either, that 
they had from Dachau where th
ey took -- we never heard ab
out that, anything like that. 
Q:   It sounds like there was -- that there 
was very little information that you got while 
you were in Germany. 
A:   Right.  The officers didn't tell us mu ch 
about anything like that, never.  No pe.  They 
should have maybe, shouldn't 
they?  But my guess -- yeah, bu
t someday if I ever find out 
where I was, I'll have to write you and tell you. 
 I've got the maps at home yet, so I'll try 

Interview with Martin Gaudian  
65 
to spot it. I'll try to. 
Q:   Thank you.  Thank you.  In that case,
 I will say thank you fo r your time, for your 
memories, and this concludes the United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Mr. Martin Gaudian on February 16th, 2011. 

A:   Thank you for listening to me.
