>> Frank Lieberm ann: My pleasure.  
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
Let's start, we have justanhour,m uchf or you to share with us.  Youtoldm e 
that your earliestm emories start in 1934 when you were 5.  Youalso saidat that time that, all 
in all, it was good,a good tim efor your parents. T ell us, to your best knowledge, why that was 
so and what you can about your fam ily and their lif eand yours in Gleiwitz in those early years 
of  your life.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann:W ell,m y father was asurgeon andhepracticed inGleiwit z. W e were 

about within anhour's drive of both of m y grandparents, who we f requently visited on 
weekends. Inour recently acquired sm all convertible, which I loved.  Normally, it wasn't 
necessary, because my father's off ice was on the Main Street, with the streetcar that went to 
thehospital and it waseasy transportationf orm ostof his patients.  So the car was a luxury,  
which I thoroughly enjoyed.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Frank, your f am ily hadbeen in the Gleiwitz area for a very long tim e, hadn't it?  
 
>> 
Frank Lieberm ann: My m other's parents had af am ily businessof leather wholesale, 
leather wholesalers and had a tannery, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1933. W hen

the Nazis came to power and m y grandf atherwas convinced that this wil l blow over, they 
survi ved the starvation of W orldW ar Iand they didn't want to move.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Frank, tell usabout your extendedf am ily.  How large was your extended 
f a m ily?   
 
>>
 
Frank Lieberm ann: My m other hadthreebrothers, and obviously I had a number of 
cousins,anaunt anduncle who m yf ather's brother was aneconom istf or the governm entand 
was f ired in1933,and unf ortunately im m igrated to Austria.  My m other's brothers were in the 
fam ily business, the older ones,buther younger brother was like my older brother.  He was 11 
years old and was still in school.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedthat you hada convertible. Having a car wasn't typical in 

those days.  Some of your mother's brothers drove m otorcycles as I rem em ber.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann:  My grandm other sleptf rom  that time on.  
 
[Laughter]
 
Especially when oneof them  tookm e on the backseat, because I loved to take a ride as a little 

g u y.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your
 
fam ily was f ond of hunting m ushroom s.  I remem ber you telling me this.  
T ell us a little about that.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: One of them ain excursions of m y mother's side was they would, in 

season, go into theforest and therearem any m ore mushroom sthan what you get in the 
grocery store.  T hey were pretty savvy in wha t topick and what not to pick. Butattheend, 
they always had a meeting, and all them ushroom s were putona table, andanyonethat didn't

look goodandm ight be poisonous, anyone couldobjectto it and itwould be thrown out. In 
other words, them ajority did not rule.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Everybody had veto power.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann:W enever got sickf rom  them . They're delicious in cooking, especially 
with  m e a ts.  
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  Frank, you started school in1935, attending apublic school.  You said tom e 
that recess was the most dangeroustim ef oryou. W ill you say a little bitabout that?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann:W ehad to leave the building, and atthat time the playground was 
separatedbetween boys and girls. W e were basically guarded by teachers along in between, 
because otherwise the danger of being attacked was substantial. W e were alwa ys glad when 
it was over.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember the stress of  that, asa youngster?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann:W ebasically knew 
--
 
we got ref lexes on how to deal with it, and we 
m ade our decisions accordingly. W hile we did get outf ive m inutesearly f rom school, so that 
we could saf ely runhom e before the rest of the school gotout.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So it gave you like af ive
-
m inutehead start?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yeah.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas 1935. Thenext year, 1936, circum stancesf or your parentsturned 

m oreom inous and becam e more diff icult, if not dangerous. W hat changed in 1936, and what 
did thatm eanfor your fam ily and you?

>> Frank Lieberm ann: After the CrimeanW ar, which happenedaf terW orld W ar II 
--
 
a f te r  
W orldW ar I, when Poland was created, m inorities were protected on both sides of the borde
r 
of  Poland. W e lived about f ive m iles, well, less thanf ive m ilesf rom the Polish border. Sothat 
the Germanshad reason not to put some of their laws in place inorder to alsoprotect the 
Nationalson thePolish side. Sothat treaty gave protectionfor 15 years,f rom  1921.  
 
 
So 1936, in July, the treaty was over, and then Der Sturm er,the very anti
-
S e m it ic  
caricaturem agazine,was at every street corner, behind glass soever ybody could read it. W e 
weren't able to use public facilities, like parks and
 
swim m ing pools.  My f ather's off ice had an 
SA, Hitler Brown Shirt guard, and he lost hishospital privileges.  T hat's how we got early 

warning that things were going to be more serious thanm y grandfather had anticipated.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So, in effect,
 
with this law expiring, it becam e, in asense, open season on 
m inority populations, because thesehad theprotection of the law that justexpired?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Correct.  T hef irst thing Hitler did in 1936 was to eliminate civil ri ghts.  

T h a t  we
nt to the area that I cam efrom  in 1936. W ehad a three
-
year reprieve.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Also in 1936, your m othermadea trip to Israel thathad a very specif ic 

purpose. Tell us about her trip. 
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann:W ell, whenm y father realized that
 
his practice was going to go, was 
going rapidly downhill, we started looking forplaces to go,andm y m other investigatedIsrael 
and came back with aver y negative report that at that tim ethere was one doctorf orevery 100 
people.  That basically, doctor
s were becom ing
 
--
 
go to kibbutz to be chicken farm ers and any 
other labor,that it would be almost im possible to practicem edicine.

>> Bill Benson:  In a sense, closing that avenue,as apracticalm atterfor yourf ather? 
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yes.  
 
>
> Bill Benson:  You just m entioned the downhill slide of  thebusiness.  Your grandparents,I 
think the leather business that they had you've actually seen theevi dence of the downhill slide 
f inancially.  Share that with us.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: After
 
--
 
m y grandparents hadan accountant, who saved the records.  
He was not Jewish.  After the war he sentm y m other
 
--
 
m y mother contacted him, he sentm y 
parents the records.  
 
 
Of course, there wereno reparations because Gleiwitz, where they were, became 
Po
lish. So landand property had no value, but they kept those records, and that in term s of  
volum e of business,the Holocaust Museum  has the records. T hey went down from about 

100,000 marks to20 by 1938,becauseof  boycotts.  
 
 
On Kristallnacht, that was
 
the night after we lef t, thebusiness was conf iscated, was 
taken over.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather,of  course, losthis ability to continue practicing m edicine, being a 
surgeon. W hat happened tohis practice, hisoff ice?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: It wen
t, pe rio d .  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Atthat tim e, with your parents thinking that they've got to getoutof  Germany, 
start to makeplans, one of the things thatthey said is you neededto learn to swim . T ell us 
about that.

>> Frank Lieberm ann:W ell, this was
 
in, I think, January 1936.  My parents said, look, you've 
got to take swim m ing lessons, because we may take an ocean voyage andthe swimm ing pool 
is going to be closedas of  July.  And I remember, Idon't know exactl y when, m y grandf ather, 
af ter I had learnedenough, took me to the swim m ing pool, said," I'm not going home until you 
pass a test of  swim m ing 20 m inutes without stopping, which makes you a swimmer."  
 
>> Bill Benson:  On an ocean liner later?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Exactly.  I still like to sw
im .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Frank, your f am ily didn't keep a kosher kitchen. Yet, you only bought kosher 

m eat in Gleiwit z at that time. W hy was that?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Gleiwit z had apopulation of about 1,000 Jews, and the onetem ple 

accommodated both l
iberal and very ritualistic fam iliesunder one rabbi, andeverybody wa s 
accommodatedtoparticipateasm uch as they needed to. T here were daily services, and 

ever ybody could participate.  But inorder to have a kosher butcher,he hadtohave enough 
c lie n t
ele in order tom ake a living.  So it was requested that everybody buys f rom the kosher 
butcher sohe can stay in business. Inotherwords, the comm unitypulledtogether.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Frank, during that tim e with yourf atherhaving lost his livel iho
od, he's no 
longer abletopractice, how did thefam ily m ake endsm eet at that tim e?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Basically, f rom  whatever savings we had.W e were looking elsewhere 

anywa y, and we lived ver y f rugally.  But we survi ved to the extent that when we
 
lef t, m y 
grandfather,m y f ather's father, didn't want tobe a burden, sohe signedhimself  into an 

assisted living place. Whatever was lef t went to support him .  
 

11

>> Bill Benson:  And also, living f rugally, I think thefam ily rented a garden space. Tell
 
u s  a 
little bit about that.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: I'm  sorry, I have to correct som ething.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  OK.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: In 1936 when we couldn't use playgrounds,ourf am ily, about 10 
fam ilies who knew each other, rented what was known a
s a garden that is a space at the edge 
of  town where you could rentplotsof  landtoplant. W eused thatasa playground. W ealso 
hada cherry tree, a pear tree,and used thatas aplaceto go to.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you couldn't go to the public parks, thisbecam e your playground?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Exactly.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Frank, in January 1938 yourfatherm adea trip to the United Statesthatmade 
it possiblef or him  later that year, in June,to leavef or the US. Tell us abouthis trip
 
in January, 
andthen the events that led up tohis departure in June of 1938.

week, and please help m e out."   
 

>> Bill Benson:  He needs it for a week? 
 
>>
 
Frank Lieberm ann: It turned out that he used thatto go to the UnitedStates. Itbrought the 
business close to bankruptcy, but they made it.  But they survi ved, and nobody talkedabout it, 
butm y grandf ather told m yf ather that if he looks him up, if  he

--
 
an aff idavit was a guarantee that whoever com es or imm igrates to the 
United States will not be unwealthyf or a year.  
 
 
T he United States was in depression, ina depression in 1938. T hat was a second d
i p 
of  the Great Depression.  So he visited him, this m an hadto show his income tax.  He was a 

vice presidentof  Bendix Aviation with a salary of  $38,000 a year in1938, which was 
enorm ous.  Hedid getthe affidavit, and we imm ediately appliedf or im m igration tothe United 
States, and we were gi ven a num ber when he came back.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he num ber was part of a quota,tobeableto getto the United States?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yes.  It was a quota,Ibelieve, of 25,000.  Now, it's 
--
 
the quota laws for 
the UnitedStates at that time were aproportion of the populationf rom  every country which 

occupied, so that it was reasonablef or Germany.  It did not existf or Poland nor a lot of the 
other countries, which were also in peril.  
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
During that time your father now has to waitf or hisnum ber to com eup. 
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Aspart of  that you told me aboutan incident, as you know I'm going toask 

a b ou t, with  the
 
--
  
>> Frank Lieberm ann: I know you're going to ask about it.  Corruption was ram pant.  In other 

words, visas were being sold by consuls withoutauthorization.  People were then deprived of  
entry, like thefam ous, or inf am ous, St.
 
Louis in Cuba, which had I think 900 refugees without 
authorization
. T he ship was off  the Florida coastfor about 10 days.  It finally went back to 

Europe, where it landed in Holland,and redeposited the people in Europe.

In our case, when nothing happenedm y father called thef riend inBerlin and said, 
" No t h in g is  ha
ppening.  I'm  really getting anxi ous."  
 
 
"W ell,the consul has a secretary, FrauleinSchm idt. W hydon't youget a nice big box of  
candy?"   
 
 
Som y f ather,being very prom pt, went to Berlin and bought FrauleinSchm idt a nicebig 
box of f ancy candy.  Am onth later still nothing had happened, so he called the f riendagain, 
askedhim , and he said, "W ell,didn't you put100m arks inside?"   
 
 
He prom ptly did that,and thenext week we got requesttohave aphysical in Berlin, and 
that led to our visa.  This was
 
not an isolatedcase.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. Had he notdone that,who knows what would have happened?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Exactly.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter yourf ather gotthe visas, everything is set, he canceled the leaseonhis 
of f i c e ,  a nd  t ha
t triggered, I think if  I rem em bercorrectly, a visit f rom the Gestapo.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: There was 
--
 
a lease in Germ any was generally done by the tenant 
gi ving the landlordamortgage.  That was a big loan.  In order to com pensate him .W henyou 
br
oke the lease, you got them ortgage back. So when he was ready to leave, he canceledhis 
leaseandhad them oney turnedover f rom  the landlord's bank to his bank, and I have to 

m entionthat all bankaccounts were f rozen in 1936.  
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  All Jewish bank accounts?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yes, all Jewish bankaccounts.  So that you couldn't take out any more 
than living e xpenses. Also, you couldn'ttake any m oney outof  Germ any. T he lim it was $2.50

per person when leaving.  And when them ortgage was transferred,som ebody f rom  the 
landlord'sbank called the Gestapoand saida large deposit went out f rom Dr.
 
Lieberm ann.  So 
they basically cam e in and said," You're under arrest.  You just withdrew a large am ountof  

m oney, and that'sforbidden."  He said, " Excuse me, it was transferred to m y bank, to the 
f rozen account."   
 
 
He calledthebank president, who was nice enough to answer the phone, and 
conf irmed that the money was redeposited and that it was in hispossession, his bank
's  
possession. So they lef t.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Frank, with thebank accountsf rozen and the inability to take cashout, as 

you said lim ited to $2.50 perperson, when yourf ather 
--
 
it was tim e to leavef or the US in June 
of  1938, how was he able to do thatf inancially as well as f or you and your mother to have 

m oney to live until youwere able to go?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann:W e were pretty close to the Czech border, and took f requent tripsto 

the giant mountains, the Sudaten Mountains,which you m ay have heard at the timeof  Munich.  
T hose were the Czech m ountains which were in the underbelly of Germ any, which 
Chamberlainand Daladier gave awa y to theGerm ans in Munich in1938.  
 
 
T hey sewed sm all am ountsof bills each tim e into their coats and various pockets, and 
gradually built up a small bank account in Czechoslovakia.  
 
 
Also, if  you tooka Germ an boat to the United States, you gotaf airly general spending 
allowance.  If you tookf irst class.  So ineachcase,m y father, then latermy m other, booke

the storm , which we had later. But we lived under
 
--
 
you could withdraw the spending 
allowance, and we live d on thatfor abouthalf a year.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat also supported your father, potentially, when he cam e to the US?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yeah.  He had a room, he lived inafurnished room for $5 a day, while 
he was studying for state boards.

Fortunately, that happened that December.

what was called the lift, which was a big container like a shipping, cargo ship.

I was 9 years old, but we developed certain 
instincts. I had fallen and brokem y arm . I knew it hurt.  Iproceeded to takem y bicycle, hold

idea. I would not have called911.  Ididm anage to gethom e.  My m other immediately called 
an orthopedistf rom Gleiwitz, who told her he's sorry, he can'thandle it, becausehe doesn't

was m y f ather's hom etown, who instructedher to take a taxi to the C
atholic orphanage and go 
in the back door, and thathe wouldm ake it his business to be thereand setmy arm  and give 
instructionstoour pediatrician, who would take careof  itf rom then on.  
 
 
So he put the cast on,andm y pediatrician did the restof  it, and didsuch a good job that 
m y lef t arm extendsf urther thanm y right arm .  
 
[Laughter]
 
It was the left onethat was broken.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  All of that was done surreptitiously?  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy did it takef our monthsfor you and your m other tof ollow your father? 
 

>> Frank Lieberm ann: The visa at that timewas 120 days.  So it was prudent to save m oney 
in the United States.  That's why m y f ather was studying, buthedoesn't have any additional 
expenses.  W e went
 
in October.  Infact, we arrived on October 20, 1938, and were m et by m y 
father and imm ediately taken to Cleveland, where he was studying at the time. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we turn toarrivin g in the US, Frank, when your m otherm adethe 
preparations, 
shearrangedf or thetrip on a ship, when you got to the port in Brem erhaven, you 
hada scary incident there.  
 
>>
 
Frank Lieberm ann:W ell, I mentioned Munich, which in order to underlinethe threat of war 
f rom  Hitler he called back all Germ an shipsat sea.  So the Europa on which we were booked 

was called back. By the way, m y f uture wif ewas on that ship.  
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  On that ship?

>> Frank Lieberm ann: Yes.  They were called back toBremenandlost three days in the 
harbor. Obviously, it was running behind schedule. W hen we got to Bremerhaven there was 
no ship, andpropaganda was so com plete, the censorship was so com plete you couldn't listen 
tof oreign radio,all press was nationalized,and infact listening toaforeign station was cause 
for im prisonmentor concentration camps.  
 
 
So that when Munichwas happening, m yf ather sent cables," Get an earlier s
h ip.  Ge t 
an earlier ship."   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Munich was a conference? 
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: The Munich Conference, where Czechoslovakia was sold down the 
ri ver.  For peace in our tim e, that's af am ousquotation of Neville Cham berlain, theprim e 
m in is t e
rof  England. That lasted exactly a ye ar.  
 
 
So anyway, we were told that the ship wouldbe com ing in thenextday, and we did the

we m ade up the f inal tim e, because it couldm ake it in six days on thepassage, well, a

W e had gotten a one

Dayton we got a letter f rom  thebicycle store,said they shouldbe very caref ul opening upm y

ownership.  In other words, nobody was allowed to own any gold. And they should keepthem 
for them for later delivery.  
 
 
My f atherturned red, blue and orange. Thatanybody would endanger our lives f or a 
few lousy gold coins, which by now are owned by m y children.  In other words, ever yone got 
one, and also Marianne.  After the war they requested the ref rigerator, he should sell them and

I knew something wasn't right, but that was the longest hour I can rem ember until m y 
parents cam eback.They answered the phone andadvised thatmy m other's brothers were

Som y f ather'snext step, even though it was bef ore the stateboards, was to take a

In other words, thefamily got too close to thatevent, and that was it

Now it's eventually

t hey were never able to get out, because we had no way of  giving 
an affidavit to guarantee that they wouldn't need help.

If you don'tm ind sharing that with us, I wish you would.  
 
>> Frank Lieberm ann: All right.  Im entioned thathe chose Dayton because there was no 
Jewish ear, nose, throat, ENT  specialist in Dayton.  As soon ashegot settled he appliedfor 
AMA membership, which was a licenseto legitim acy at that tim e, because if you belongedto 
the AMA you had to show that you went to an accreditedm edical school,that you had a good 
reputation, that you got theproper background, and it was a requirem ent f or getting hospital

Aaronand his sister, to the Czech Republic,Slovakia, and southernPoland.  Among other 
things, we went back to the town where I was f rom , which is now in Poland. W henever I think 
of  thator hear of  it, I kind of pinchm y cheek to think that I could have possibly li ved there, 
because with all of thethings which we discussed about the Holocaust, was gi ven the chance 
to live the American dream, which I would have never doneelsewhere.  I'm  gratefulf or that.  
 
 
I go onef urther. I've m ade peace. W hen Ivolunteer here at them useum , I have abig
