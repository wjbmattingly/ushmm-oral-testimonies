Milton Green, 5/14/1996 
 

 
Q: –..name, date of birth. 
 
A: Milton Green, and I™m 82 years old and I was born in Lowell, 
Massachusetts but we moved to Lowell when I was about five years old 

to Brookline, Mass . And we went to temple, I went to Temple Israel in 

Boston sinc e I was about five years old till even now. 
 

Q: –growing up, family, religious background. 
 
A: Yes, I moved to, to Br ookline in 
1925 and I have a twin sister and a 
brother and another sister. And we 
lived in Brookline and I went to 
Temple Israel which is  a Reform temple and the head of that temple 

was Rabbi Levy, was a well known r
abbi in those days and it™s a 
Reform temple. And my parents 
were quite religious and I was 
actually bar mitzvahed at a temple
 in Brookline and also went to 
Temple Israel. 
 
 And we observed all the holiday
s or most of the holidays but 
specifically we weren™t really terrib
ly religious. We didn™t, we didn™t 
have kosher set up and all but we 
always went at diff erent holidays, 
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and we still do. But our religious 
training was, was moderate. And I we
nt to school at Brookline and it 
was a grammar school called Edward Devotion School and us that™s 

when I star ted to be interested in track and I was captain of the 
grammar school track team. 
 
 And the principal of the school wa
s named Charles Taylor and he was 
very interested in my athletic acti
vities and he really encouraged me 
especially in track. ‚Cause in thos e days I held a record in high jump 
when I was eleven years old. And he 
was sort of sponsoring me in all 
activities. And then I went to high school and I was captain of the 

track team there. And held quite a few records in the interscholastic 
meets and that was in 1932. 
 
 And then I went Exeter Academy for 
one year in preparation to go to 
Harvard and while I was at Harvar
d, I, well I was at a summer camp 
rather in 1932. I met this Norman 
Carnis who eventually became my 
roommate and he was an outstanding track athlete too. He was a 

hammer thrower and also a hundred yard dash runner. 
 

 And in 1935 there was a Harvard-Ya
le track team that competed in 
London against Oxford-Cambridge 
and Norman Carnis was a hammer 
thrower mostly at that time. And they didn™t have the hammer throw 
in the Oxford-Cambridge meet so he trained in the 100, 220 and made 
the team in the hundred and the 220 which was an unusual 
combination, a hammer thrower an
d a hundred year dash. And I was 
in the, in three events. At
 the Oxford-Cambridge meet. 
 

 That was in 1935 in the high hurdles, the low hurdles, and the running 
broad jump. It was called broad jump th
at  time but it™s called the long 
jump now. And I won two events at
 the Oxford-Cambridge meet. And 
we, I™ve been always thinking and wanting to be in the Olympics. And 
of course that was my hope to be
 in the Olympics but in 1936 in the 
Harvard-Yale game, the Harvard-Yale
 track meet, Carnis and myself 
had won six of, six gold medals between us . 
 
 And there was quite a bit of public
ity about it and about our Olympic 
plans and whether we were going to 
the Olympics or  whether we could 
qualify. And I had qualified for the final tryouts in Randall Island. And 
I got a certificate from  Avery Brundage and I think I had submitted to 
your group the certificate from Av
ery Bru ndage saying that I had 
qualified for the final tryouts. 
 

Q: –withoutmentioningthe 
museum, got the certificate. 
 

A: Yes, I had, I received a cert
ificate from the American Olympic 
committee. Avery Brundage. And it st
ated that I had qualified through 
all the preliminary tryouts for the final tryouts at Randall Island. And 
about at that time, there was some publicit y in the Boston papers 

about my roommate and me, Norman
 Carnis and myself. There was a 
picture of us winning six gold medals. 
 
 And some of the executives or the committee members at Temple 
Israel and Rabbi Levy had seen the 
publicity and knew
 that we were 
potential Olympic candidates. An
d one of the committee members 
called me and said he would like, congratulated me for our 
performance at the Harvard-Yale track meet. And said that Rabbi 
Levy would like to talk to us about the Olympics and the potential 
there. And could we meet with him.
 And we met with him. At Temple 
Israel. 
 
 And they explained to us what 
was happening in Germany at that 
time. The terrible things that were going on and all the activities 
against the Jews and people in Ge
rmany. And we, we sort of knew 

something about the problem of (    
 ) but not in any great details. And 
were really quite taken aback with information that they gave to us. 
And then he, and at that time it wa
s suggested that it might be a good 
idea for us not to go to the Olympics. Because of all this, thes e 

problems that sort of register our ob
jections  and sort of boycotting the 
Olympics. 
 
 And we were quite taken aback about
 that thought. They tried to 
explain to us that we would never regret if we did take that action, to 
boycott the Olympics and they suggest
ed that we talk  it over and let 
them know  what, what our thoughts were, if we wanted any further 

discussion. And we, Norman Carnis an
d I went back and talked it over 
and thought we had discussed it  wi
th our parents as we had great 
respect for their judgment. 
 
  
  And after talking it over with ou
r parents, they also called Rabbi Levy 
to see what his thoughts were again. To get an explanation from him. 

And my father told me that he was satisfied and had confidence in 
Rabbi Levy™s judgment and that we wo
uldn™t regret it if we did boycott 
the Olympics. Of cour se the problem was, not the problem but the 

question was we, you know how i
mminent our selection onto the 
Olympic team would be. 
 

 And I held the world™s record in the high hurdles and also the Harvard-
Yale record in the broad jump. Andat that time and the Harvard-Yale 

broad jump event which I held the record in was over 24 feet, 11 
inches. And I had been running in three events at that  track meet and 
the coach said not to take too many jumps because I had to save myself 

for the other events. 
 

 And on the first try on the broad jump I had fouled the take of f, 
stepped over the mark. And he said to
 be very careful on the next jump 
because he didn™t want me to take
 all my full jumps. So on the next 
jump I was very careful and took  off about a foot behind the take off 

board and I did 24 feet 11, so I was cl
ose to 26 feet in the actual jump. 
 
 And they thought that I could, had a good chance of qualifying for the 
Olympics in the long jump. Wher e I had the potential to go clos e to 26 

feet. And in the high hurdles, whic
h was the other event that I was, 
had qualified for, I had been runnin
g aroun d  14, 9, 15 seconds in the 
high hurdles and the qualifying ti
mes were in the 14 second, pr obably 
14, 2, or 3, but I was improving in the high hurdles and I practiced 
timing event, timing in the high
 hurdle practice rounds and I was 

getting closer to the 14, 5, 14, 4. 
And they felt that there was a good 
chance that I could make the team in maybe two events. But at any 
rate, after the discussion with Rabbi Levy and my parents and this 
whole situation about boycotting, both Carnis and I decided that we 
would boycott the Olympics and we di
dn™t go into the finial tryouts. 
 

 And although I was disappointed I fe
lt that that was the thing to do 
and that™s what basically happened, 
as far as boycotting the Olympics 
[were] conc erned because that time I was a senior at Harvard and I 

was interested in getting into busi
ness and whether to go into business 
right away, after graduation which was in 1936 or to go to graduate 

school. And now I decided to go to Harvard Business School and then 
go into the real estate business. 
 
 So I was interested in looking, I was always interested in athletics. 

And I knew that I was a pretty good athlete and as I say I was captain 
of all the track teams since I was 
in grammar school. But my focus 
after getting out of college was not, had nothing to do really with 

athletics, although I was interest
ed in all athletics and tennis and 
skiing and all the other activities . But I decided to go to the Harvard 

Business Sc hool and then to go into business in the real estate 
business. 

 
And that™s what happened and I was interested in, you know, finding a 
nice gal and getting married too. So
 that™s the basic course that I 
followed. And after I got out of the 
business school I participated in 
tennis. And I was ranked number six in New England in the super 
senior category so I was always intere
sted in athletics but that™s really 
the basic story about what happened in the situation.  
 
Q: –elaborate on some of those poin
ts–came from a Jewish background,  
 identified as a Jewish boy. 
 
A: That™s right, absolutely. My mother
 and father as say were Reform at 
that time. When I moved to Brooklin
e in 1925. But their parents were 
very religious, my mother™s parents 
particularly because my father™s 
parents weren™t around at that ti
me. But my mother
™s parents, the 
name was Waburn and they
 were very religious and we used to go over 
to their home, to their apartment and celebrate all the Jewish 
holidays. And as I say they were ve
ry religious and my parents were 
religious but they were Reform. 
 

Q: What about your friends, were yo
ur friend s mixed or  did you really 
grow up in a more Jewish environment? 

 
A: I™d say that I grew up basically in
 a mixed environment. After we lived 
in Brookline, in 1929 we moved to Ne
wton. And I went to Newton High 
School. In those days it wasn™t too 
integrated. And my friends, I™ d say 
were 50/50 Jewish and non-
Jewish and so our upper     was [difficult to 
figure out what was missing here], 
was mixed but our social activities 
were mostly Jewish ac tivities. 
 

Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitis
m from your classmates or people 
when you were growing up? 
 
A: Not particularly. High school, never noticed any. I knew it was around 
and there were situations but in co
llege, at Harvard we lived Carnis 
and I lived in Lowell House. And th
ey had common room eating and we 
mixed with all of the, everyone 
there and we, we never noticed any 
particular anti-Semitism. But we knew it existed. But we were never 

particularly subjected to it. 
 

Q: Do you think that sports in your 
early athletic career provided a good 
opportunity for you to fit into the main stream and move beyond your 

Jewish environment. 
 
A: I never particularly thought of it in
 that way. But it was the focus that 
you know put us in contact with all the– 
 
Q: –start the sentence by saying spor
ts or athletics was 
the focus so that 
you say the subject in the sentence– 
 
A: Oh yeah, I see. You know spor ts an
d athletics were a focus. Because as 
I say I was captain of the team so I was, did pretty well in all the 
events. While it was a focus and I 
enjoyed it, it wasn™t 100 percent 
focus. But I trained carefully and did all the training that the coaches 

had suggested but I would say it 
was a focus but not 100 percent so. 
 

Q: And you mentioned that you had worked toward going to the Olympics. 
Was that a real serious possibility in your mind? 
 

A: Yes, it was.  Going to the Olympi
cs was a very serious focus at that 
time and it was a focus on training and doing extra training and 

exercises too and I was watching the 
performances all over the world, 
in my particular events, particular
ly. And yes it was something that I 
was always  thinking about when I 
was training and I had hoped to 
make the Olympic team. 
 

Q: So it must have been somewhat 
disappointing when, even though it 
was your choice, you weren™t going to participate. 
 
A: It was my boycotting the Olympics through the meetings I had with 
Rabbi Levy, yes I was, I 
was disappointed. And felt
 that that focus that 
I had had all these years was going to materialize but somehow or 
another I felt that it was the right thing to do and I never had any 
regrets about it one way or another. 
 
Q: What gave  you that moral grounding? 
 
A: Well I don™t think the moral grounding in relation to that was not 
really a basic factor. I don™t think 
it had anything to do with moral 
grounding. It was just a realization that was something that should be 
done and I had great respect for 
Rabbi Levy because prior to our 
meeting with him, although I had heard about the problems in 
Germany and what was going on, I 
didn™t really have a detailed 
understanding of the problems ther
e and that meeting was really a 
shocker to both Carnis and myself. An
d it struck home to me that that 
was something I wanted to do af ter they explained the situation. 
 
Q: You talk about this meeting. Can you go into more detail about what 
they said to you and what helped  you make this choice? 
 

A: Well the meeting with Rabbi Le vy was at the Temple Israel executive 
boardroom. And we weren™t sure what he was going to tell us about 

what was happening in Germany. But the several board members of 
the men™s committee and the rabbi went
 into pretty good detail. But I 
don™t remember all the items that they discussed particularly, but they 
told us about the terrible things that were going on in Germany and 
the Nazi regime. And it was a shocke
r to me and Norman Carnis and it 
just struck home that it was someth
ing that we should do or consider 
doing. But I don™t remember particularly all the gory details that  they 
went into. 
 

Q: Do you remember any of the details? 

 
A: Not really. Something about book burning and taking away the rights 
of the Jews and putting them in ghettos and I suppose it was Œ I don™t 

remember it was that time or af
terwards, but they mentioned about 
the killing of Jews. And then all thos
e details were pretty repulsive to 

us. 
 

Q: Were there at that point to your 
knowledge, press statements or public 
statements about boycotting and about Germany? 
 
A: Yes there were. There was publicity about the boycotting and 
discussions between the Olympic Committee and there were some 

other groups that were, had mentione
d in the press about they should 
boycott the Olympics. And there were other groups that said they 

shouldn™t boycott the Olympics so 
I was just aware that there was a 
discussion going on about boycotting but I wasn™t aware of all the 
details involved. 
 

Q: Were you aware of other athletes who were considering boycotting? 
 
A: Not particularly. I did, I wasn™t 
aware of any other athletes that I 
knew of  and I wouldn™t be in contact with them other than through 
publicity in the papers. But I remember something about Stoller and 
those track athletes that were ques
tioning about going to the Olympics 
but I don™t particularly remember the time frame in connection with 

that but I do remember the discussion about it. 
 

Q: Did the press and some
 of these organizations 
who were talk ing about 
boycotting influence you or–. 
 

A: No, I didn™t think the press or th
e publicity influenced me one way or 
the other because I wasn™t aware at that time in any great detail of the 

problems going on in Germany and the Nazis with the Jews. I knew 
there were problems and it was seri
ous but I wasn™t aware of all the 
details. 
 

Q: When you decided to boycott was th
is primarily to take a stand or was 
there any concern about your safety in going over there? 
 
A: No, I wasn™t worried at all about safety but the reason I boycotted it 
was entirely a result of the meet
ing with Rabbi Levy. That was the 
essential dominant factor involved. 
 
Q: Did you consider this a substant ial sacrifice on your part? I mean you 
had been working for this for a long time. 
 
A: Well boycotting the Olympics was a sacrific e because I had always 
wanted to be in the Olympics but I di
dn™t consider it as, once we made 
up our mind and I was aware of whatwas going on there, I didn™t look 
at it particularly as a sacrifice, althou
gh it was. But I didn™t consider it 
a terrible blow. 

 
Q: Once you made the decision to bo
ycott, were you asked to or did you 
make any public statements in an 
effort to influence other people? 
 
A: No. We never made any public statements or indicated what steps we 
had taken. 
 
Q: When you were in a pr etty high 
profile position. You were captain of 
varsity track in Harvard, I™m surprised that someone didn™t come to 
you and say will you speak out for this boycott. 
 

A: Well after we boycotted the Olympics
, no one came to speak to us or 
ask us if we™d make any statement 
about it and I don™t think anyone 
knew partic ularly that we did boyc
ott it. Cause there was no publicity 
about it one way or the other. The 
only publicity we had was when I 
spoke to the track coac h at Harvard. His name was Yacko Macola. He 

was the assistant coach but he was the Œ in 1936 he was the track 
coach, and we told him about our intention and he tried to persuade us 
not to do it. He said he didn™t thin
k we™d do much good and we should 
try to go to the final tryouts and tr
y to make the team. But we didn™t 
want to do that. And that was the 
only conversation we really had 
about it, publicity wise. 
 

Q: –ask you about where you were 
during the games and–.[tape ended 
and new tape began with the followi
ng.] When we stopped you were 
telling me that you and Norman Carnis, your roommate went and told 
your Harvard track coach of your decision. 
 

A: That™sright. 

 
Q: Can you e xpand upon that a little? 
 
A: We, I went to see the track coach, Norman Carnis didn™t. 
 
Q: Let me rephrase that. 
 

A: Allright. 
 
Q: You went and told your coach 
who you had been working with at 
Harvard of your decision. 
 
A: Yes, I told Yacko Macola. I went 
to see him and told him that we had 
decided not to go into the final tryouts. 
 

Q: –saythatagain–  
 
A: Well I went  to see, to tell my tr
ack coach at Harvard, Yacko Macola, 
that we weren™t going to go into 
the final tryouts and told him the 
reason that we had spoken to our religious leader, Rabbi Levy, and 
that we had decided because of the situation that we were told about 
that we weren™t going to go to the final tryouts and he was quite 
disturbed Œ not distur bed but felt that we should really go ahead and 

we™ve always wanted to be in the Olympics and he thought we had, 
that I had a great chance to qualify 
in two events. And that we, that I 
should really try to change my mind about going to the final tryouts 

but he didn™t persuade us, persuade me rather. And that was the 
extent of the discussion wi
th Yacko Macola, the coach. 
 

Q: Did other colleagues of yours on the track team at Harvard go the 
Olympics or  go to at least the final tryouts? 
 

A: None that I know of . There was no
 one else that had qualified for the 
final tryouts from Harvard, except me. And I had no discussion with 

them at that time.  We were, I think, having final exams and 
graduation around June 10
th
 or 12
th
 and I had no discussion with 
anyone about the final tryouts. 
 

Q: You were focused on sports; you we
re focused on your scholarship. You 
really weren™t at that  point Œ it doesn™t sound like that focused on being 

Jewish. And yet this meeting at your Temple was very compelling to 
you. 
 

A: Well, no, I was focused on being Je
wish. I was focused on being Jewish 
because I felt loyal and loyalty to Judaism and I had no, we had 
contact with non-Jews in college and everything but that wasn™t a 
problem as far as I was concerned. 
 

Q: Let me ask you where you were at the time of the games? 
 
A: At the time of the Olympic games I was working at a summer camp as 
a counselor  up in Maine, up in Wa
terville, Maine. It was called Cedar 
Crest Camp. And I don™t think they had 
television at that time or  they 
didn™t have it at the camp. But I 
remember of course eagerly reading 
the papers on the results and figuring out the times that they were 

winning the events in and the dist
ances in the long jump. So I was 
following it  very carefully but I di
dn™t, I don™t remember seeing them 
actually on TV, but I did later on, on the re-runs. 
 

Q: What about newsreels in the movie houses, anything like that? 
 
A: Well we didn™t go to the movies at camp. 
 
Q: Theradio? 
 
A: Yeah, I think we had, I think there was a radio we were listening to> I 
don™t remember what the time fact
or was between the events and the 
time zone in Waterville, Maine. 
 
Q: Do you remember how you felt as you were following the Olympics? 
Wistful? 
 
A: Yeah, I was, I was thinking about ho
w it would have been to have been 
running in those events and now whether I could have been a medal 
winner and I was thinking in those terms but I didn™t focus as far as 
actually winning the event at that time. 
 

Q: Were you sorry you weren™t there? 
 
A: I suppose in a way I was because as I say I had been thinking about it 
for all those years, so I was in a wa
y feeling that if I could have made 
the team and I thought I could that I would have liked  to have been in 

that Olympic setting. 
 

Q: Isn™t the Olympics a real dream? What does  it mean to you? 
 
A: Well now that™s the peak of traini
ng or one of the peaks, one of the 
objectives to be in the Olympics as I™
ve gone to a lot of the Olympics to 
see it myself. In Los Angeles an
d in Korea and I™m going to the 
Olympics in Atlanta this summer with my grandchildren and I always 
watch those track events with great interest. 
 

Q: Did you feel any resentment about the other athletes who chose to 
compete, es pecially the Jewish ones? 
 

A: No, I had no feelings about the Jewi
sh athletes that competed. I didn™t 
know them number one, but I had no
 feelings one way or the other 
about their competing, I mean that was up to them and I had no 
resentment  at all about those that did go. 
 

Q: Do you think the American government should have made more of a 
stand? 
 

A: In retrospect, I certainly do. I think they should have definitely 
boycotted. 
 
Q: I need you to say the American governme nt. 
 
A: Well as far as the boycott is concerned, I think the Am erican 
government definitely should have 
boycotted the Olympics in Berlin 
just like they boycotted the Russian Olympics and now they would 

have all the more of  the facts than I ever had and I think it was 
definitely a mistake that they didn
™t boycott the Olympics in 1936. 
 

Q: Do you think it would have made a diff erence? 
 
A: Yes, I think it would have made
 a great difference to have the 
American government show their opposition to what  was going on over 
there in the Nazi regime. I think they made a serious mistake not to 
boycott it and I know that ther e was 
a lot of talk pro and against the, 
boycotting the Olympics. But I think this is  a result more in retrospect 

rather than at the time. But as I thin
k of  it now, I definitely think it 
was a mistake not to boycott it. 
 
Q: Did you feel at all alone in your decision, as you were following the 
games? 
 

A: Well I had no recollection particularly of what my feelings were at that 
time in 1936. But it wasn™t any great feeling that I had cause once I 

made up my mind and felt that it sh
ould be that I should go or try for 
the final tryouts, I didn™t lose any sleep over that decision. 
 

Q: It™s really hard for me to imagine 
that you had been training, that this 
was a real dream of yours and you ma
de this decision for all of the 
right reasons but that  you weren™t a little bit torn apart by it. 
 

A: No, I don™t, as I remember it
, I didn™t, I don™t remember being 
particularly torn apart. No, I had a longing and a desire to have been 

in it, but I didn™t have as I look  
back on it, I don™t remember having 
any terrible regrets for having made the decision. 
 

Q: Never a second thought? 
 
A: Never a second thought on it. 
 
Q: Now let me ask you a sort of  a different question. I think you made a 
pretty bold and moral decision, howeve
r you want to phrase it in 1936. 

Do you think as you look back on the times since then, do you think 
that that decision impacted the way 
you live your life or taught you an 
important lesson or really me
ant something very special? 
 
A: Well my decision not to partic ipate in the final tryouts, I don™t think 
had any great impact on my future one way or the other. I mean I 

participate in athletics and as I 
said, I was pretty lucky to be 
performing and held the world™s record and Harvard records and was 
in the Harvard Hall of Fame for at
hletes and it had no particular 
impact one way or the other. 
 
Q: Did it encourage you when there we
re other tough decisions to take the 
high road. Did you learn anythi ng from it? 
 
A: Well no, I don™t think, I mean I felt good that I made the decision. But I 
don™t, as I said I don™t think it  ha
d any impact as far as my future 
activities or  living or philosophies 
were concerned. It had no great 
impact one way or the other. 
 

Q: It™s a long time ago. Do you ever
 think back on that period and what 
you went through at the time? 
 

A: Yeah, I think back on making that decision and whether I would have 
on or not Œ silver or gold or some so
rt of a medal and every time I go to 
the Olympics, I™ve been to three of them and I watch,  I particularly 
watch the high hurdles and the lo
ng jump and I pictur e myself as 
maybe having won a medal on it, an 
Olympic medal. But I participated 
in the Senior Olympics in 1983 in Fl
orida. Florida Senior Olympics and 
I won ten medals at that but that 
was not the real Olympics, that was 
the Senior Olympics. So I, you know 
I™ve won medals in Olympic senior 
competition. 
 
Q: Since that time you™ve heard and read a lot about the 1936 Olympics 
and the extent of the pageantry and the celebration and the 

propaganda and all of  this. Do you 
think  that s p or ts  c an be s e par ate 
from politics or that they™re just 
inextricably linked in situations like 
that? 
 
A: Well I think spor ts can be separa
ted from politics. In a way they 
should be but it depends on what th
e separation is. I mean interference 
by the government, particularly in 
spor ts, I wouldn™t like to see that 
but this is  a, the boycotting is diffe
rent, I don™t consider that a mixing 
of spor ts and politics or a separation. I mean I think that™s a moral 

ground and I just think that they sh
ould have been boycotted; the U.S. 

should have boycotted it, not becauseit™s Œ there™s separation of those 
activities. But I just think they shou
ld have just the way they did in 
the Russian Olympics. 
 
Q: Germany certainly didn™t separate sports and politics in 1936. 
 
A: Well I imagine they didn™t. 
 

Q: Thank you. I think that™s all my 
questions but I just want to make 
sure. Tell me about how this meeting came about. Who was there, why 

they called you in, what the atmosp
here was like and what you did. 
 

A: Well I remember after the Harvard/
Yale track meet, which Carnis and 
I won six gold medals there was 
quite a bit of publicity in the 
newspapers and there was a picture of
 Carnis and myself in the sport 
page. I forget which paper it was, 
and saying how we™d won six gold 
medals and I think they called us 
Damon and Pythias because we were 
such good friends.  
 
About three or four days after the track meet, I got a phone call. I 
forget what the fellow™s name was 
but he said he was calling at the 
request of Rabbi Levy. And he was 
on the men™s council of the Temple 
and he had read about what we di
d at the Harvard/Yale track meet. 
And that he understood we were contenders for the Olympics and he 
had some important information that he™d like to talk  to us  about at 
the request of Rabbi Levy and as I had mentioned, Rabbi Levy was the 
head of Temple Israel in Boston, a Reform Temple, and he was well-
respected all over the United States. And I was conf irmed at Temple 
Israel and naturally when they as
ked us  to come, or asked me and 
Norman Carnis, we agreed to come 
and I think  it w as  s e t f or  two or  
three days later. 

 
Q: What was going on in your mi
nd, why they had called you over? 
 
A: He said something about he wanted to talk  to us  about the Olympics 
and so I wasn™t partic ularly prep ar
ed, I didn™t know  what they were 
going to talk about. Except that something about the Olympics and we 

went to the boardroom at the Temple Israel on Commonwealth Avenue 
in Boston, that™s wher e the Temp le was at that time. 
 

 And we went there and they explained about the reas on they wanted 
to talk to us  was in connection with what was going on in Germany. 

And they explained the problems that were going on there with the 

Nazis and the terrible things that were happening to the Jews there  

and I don™t remember the exact details of exactly what items they were 
talking about but it was a terrible picture as I remember it and they 
discussed it fully and we told th
em that, I told them that I was 
preparing to go to the final tryouts. And that I™d qualified and had to 

get prepared for it and train again and they explained to me that again 
it was a terrible situation there in Germany and they suggested that 
they thought it would be a very good
 idea to boycott the Olympics and 
they were quite sure that I™d neve
r regret it. Even though I had  my 
heard set on being in the Olympics and they suggested that you know 

it was up to me and Carnis decided wh
at we wanted to do and so I told 
them that we™d talk  it over and let them know what we wanted to do 

and that was the basic situation as far as that meeting is concerned. 
 

Q: And they really left it
 up to you that decision? 
 
A: that™s right, they left the decision 
entirely up to us. They didn™t say you 
had to or they indicated, they re
commended strongly that it was the 
right thing to do and we would never regret making the decision. 
 

Q: Why was all this so compelling? You were excited, you were ready to go 
to the tryouts, the finals and that meeting really turned you around. 
 

A: Yes, that meeting really turned us
 around because we were horrified at 
what the terrible things that were going on in Germany and we just 

felt it was the right thing to do and ma
de up our mind to do it af ter as I 
say we, I talked it over with my parents. 
 
Q: After the meeting did you go immediately home? Did you consult with 
your parents, or your friends? What took place next? 
 

A: Well I was living at the Lowell Ho
use at Harvard at the time with 
Norm Carnis and we went back and talked  it over and decided that I™d 

go home and talk things over with 
my parents, they lived in Newton. 
And I went home and talked it over with them and as I explained, my 

father called Rabbi Levy to find
 out if I had the right report. 
 
 And after his discussion with Rabbi Levy, he felt that the rabbi had a 
complete understanding of the whole si
tuation and he could rely on his 
judgment and that I should rely on 
his judgment and he said that you 
know left it up to me but he strongly recommended that I go along with 

the suggestion from the rabbi andthe men™s committee. I think the 
head of the Men™s committee I think 
it was a fellow named Kimler or 
something close to it, or Kimmel or 
Kemla, it™s some name like that. 
 

Q: Did you follow the trials at Randalls Island? 
 
A: Yes, I followed it to see what they were doing and– 
 
Q: Begin that  sentence–. 
 
A: Yeah, I followed the trials at Randalls Island cause I was you know 
very much interested but as I say, I had no regrets after deciding not to 
go into the final tryouts. 
 

Q: When you were following those tr
youts, how were your times compared 
to the times that qualified people? Would you have probably gone? 
 
A: I don™t remember the details of the times at that time. As I recollect 
now I think I could have made the team at two events Œ the long jump 
and the high hurdles. I™m pretty sure I could have done it in the long 
jump, I™m not that certain about the 
high hurdles. Because it depended 
on how much I improved at my timing there and really concentrating 

on that event, but I don™t remember the details partic ularly. 
 

Q: Go back for a second. When you received the certificate from Brundage 
saying you had qualified for the fina
ls, what was it like getting that 
letter? 
 
A: I was very pleased but I knew that I had qualified because I won the 
preliminary events and knew that the winning of those preliminary 

events would get me into the finial tryouts but I liked the certificate 
and I was you know very pleased to have
 it and I fram ed it and kept it.  
 
Q: When you followed the games fr
om the camp in Maine, did your  
campers follow them with you and did 
they know that you were in this 
world class– 
 

A: Yeah, they knew I was. 
 
Q: Can you say my campers? 

 
A: Yeah, when I was a Cedar Crest ca
mp during the Olympics in 1936, 
most of  the campers knew I was a 
good athlete and was material for 
the Olympics and the year before I was in the Oxford-Cambridge meet 
and there was quite a bit of publicit
y and they talked  about it when I 
came back to camp. So yes, there was quite a bit of talk about the 
Olympics and whether I could have gotten a medal or not. 
 

Q: A more personal way to follow the games. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: After ‚36 you went on to graduate school. 
 
A: Yes I did. 
 

Q: Did you, during the war were you in the Ar my or– 
 
A: Yeah, I was. I enlisted  in the Navy aviation and I was in 1943 I 
volunteered for the Navy aviation and I was in a naval squadron which 

at that time was a scouting squa
dron. It was Scouting Squadron 31 
and I came in as a lieutenant junior grade which is the equivalent to a 

first lieutenant. And I came out in 1945 as a lieutenant commander 

and our– 
 

Q: Overseas and all? 
 
A: Our squadron was an anti-submarine squadron and we were patrolling 
for and es corting ships out of  Boston harbor and Portland, Maine 

harbor. And after the VE Day we were sent  to Norf olk, Virginia and 

our squadron was being prepared to go
 out to the Pacific. And I wasn™t 
a part of it but I was what they ca
ll an air combat intelligence officer. 
And then the war ended, while I wa
s in Norfolk and about a year, six 
months later I guess it was.  So I 
was in the service in the Navy from 
™42 I guess to ™46. 
 

Q: At what point did you,  after ‚36, 
at what point did you start, when did 
you start learning about what was unfolding in Europe? 
 

A: Well I followed the war very care
fully, of the campaigns in North 
Africa and all the different campaigns and was watching it very 

carefully. But I wasn™t particular ly 
aware of any more activities in 
Nazi Germany at that particular  time ot her than what  was going on in 

the papers. 
 
Q: Did you know about Kristallnac ht? 
 
A: Yeah, I remember reading about that and all the terrible things that 
were happening there and that revolted me tremendously. 
 
Q: Did you feel vindicated in your decision? 

 

A: I never looked at it in that vein; I never looked at it in the idea I was 
vindicated or not vindicated. Because 
I felt it was the right thing to do 
when I made that decision. I didn™t think it was in any other terms. 
 
THE END
