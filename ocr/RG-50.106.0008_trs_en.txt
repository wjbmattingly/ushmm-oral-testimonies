Interview with Henry Kolber

busin ess and he employed some of the 
inhabitants of this particular town . 
Q: Was your family a 
very religious family? 
A: No.  My father was not very religious but
 we attend services in the next small town 
because the town wher
e I was born and where we lived 
later, it was composed only of 
two other Jewish family. 
Q: So both towns were
 not primarily Jewish. 
A: No, they were not. 

Q: How large was the town that y ou first lived in, approximately? 

A: Well, approximately it was ma ybe hundre
d or 115 inhabitants but they were all 
Roman Catholic. 
Q: And when did you move 
to the next town?  Do 
you remember what year? 
A: I -- 

Q: Or how old you were? 
A: From the time when I was born, apparen
tly -- I do not reme mb er when  we moved.  
Apparently, I was very young -- 
Q: You were still young. 
A: -- because my brother, who was born two 
years later, was born already in the next 
town. 
Q: I see.  D id you live -- what was 
the next town that you were -- 
A: __________  (so
unds like Parcheetza). 
Q: And is that in the same general location? 

A: That is the same general location.  It's
 only like three kilomete
rs away from the town 

Interview with Henry Kolber

where I was born. 
Q: And you had said that there were also onl
y two other families that
 were Jewish in the 
town. 

A: That is correct. 

Q: Uh-huh.  And did you grow up ri
ght in the center of the town? 

A: Yes.  I grew up in the center of the town
 and when  -- and I attended public school 
there.  And at age of 11 or ten, my father 
hired a tutor who taught 
us the -- prepared for 
the bar mitzvah, me and my  brother.  And we 
had this man -- or different me n living with  
us.  So he was tutoring me, my brother, an
d later my sisters in relig ious observance. 
Q: Let's talk about your experiences with n
on-Jews when you were a young ch ild because 
you mu st have had many of them because
 there were only two other families. 
A: Well, in my case, I have to say that the 
neighbors treated us quite well.  We did not 
experience like in other area b
ecause my  father employed quite a large numb er of the 
villagers.  So they had to be 
quite decent with us.  As a matter of fact, I went to school 
with one of the fellows, who later, I feel 
that he saved my  life because he came to 
Auschwitz much earlier th
an me and he had, by th e time I arrived in Auschwitz, he was a 
__________ (sounds like schriebe
r) on the block.  That's  a qu
ite high position.  And he 
helped me quite a lot with the food and 
protect me from the atrocities which were 
occurring in Auschwitz. 
Q: Okay.  We'll talk about th
at a little later.  When you we
re young, what about your 
playmates generally?  Did you experience 
any antisemitism among your play mates? 
A: Very little.  Very little.  Because, as 
I explained previously
, those people were 

Interview with Henry Kolber

depending on th e livelihood from my  father. 
Q: And the teachers -- 
A: The teachers -- 
Q: -- did not give you any problem? 

A: The teachers never gave me
 any problem, because, as -- it 
was a village.  It was not a 
town.  And those teachers used
 to be involved with my 
mother because 
she was more 
intelligent than the 
normal villagers.  So they came and sometimes socialized together. 
Q: Were you in 
any youth groups? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No. 

Q: Did you do any sports? 

A: Not really.  Not organized sports.  I play
ed soccer, which was very popular in Poland, 
but nothing organized. 

Q: Okay .  When  did you first notice a change
?  What is the first thing that became 
apparent? 
A: Well, in 1939, when the Germans start to
 occupy Po land, some of the inhabitants 
became Volksdeutsche.  That 
means that they were claiming that their ancestor were 
from German descent.  And they
 got some positions of importance.  And then  there were 
like -- they felt they 're 
much, they are mu
ch better and that -- but actually they did not -- 
maybe there was overt antisemitism.  Did not
, I didn't feel any repercussion from them 
except they did not socialize or
 have anything to do with us. 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
7 
Q: You were 16 years old when  
the war began in Po land.  Do
 you remember that actual 
moment when they  ca
me to your village? 
A: Oh, I do remember this becau
se we -- my father felt, the 
day the war broke, that was 
September 1st, 19 -- 
Q: '39. 

A: --'39, that we were not very secure in th
is village.  So we packed our belongings on a 
horse and wagon -- actually, we 
didn't have no cars -- and went to the next town  to be 
between Jews, where the town was, Stary Sacz
 (please check).  And I would say it was at 

least 100 to 150 Jewish family live in there. 
Q: What was the name of the town? 
A: Stary Sacz. 

Q: And then you stayed there. 

A: We were there for about two days.  And ther
e was some incident at this first encounter 
with the Germans.  They order all Jews to
 assemb le on the marketplace.  And they 
selected, I don't remember exact
ly, ten or 15 of the people, 
ordering them, and they shot 
them there.  Then -- 
Q: This is someth
ing you witnessed. 
A: Yes, I witnessed.  That was my first 
part, encounter with 
the Germans.  And -- 
Q: You were 16 years old at the time. 

A: Yes, I was 16. 
Q: What were your feelings, then, wh
en you saw that 
as a young man? 
A: Well, my feeling was that, here I am, witn
esses finally what I had for few years, what 

Interview with Henry Kolber

the Germans are capable of do to the Jews.  Af
ter the execution of thos
e people, they also 
selected a h u ndred of people and locked th
em up in a school build ing overnight.  My 
father was between those.  And that was quite
 big shock to the family because we did not 
know what will happen with those hostages.  
Next morning, though, 
they were released 
and after, oh, I don't know, three, four hour
s, we packed  our belo
ngings and went back 
home. 
Q: And the next experience? 
A: Well, the next experience was just that 
from time to time we were inducted in the 
work groups.  In Poland the 
road s are not paved like we ha
ve paved here.  They were, 
like, dirt roads.  So we were, during the su
mmer and fall, we built th
e roads.  We chopped 
the stones that the roads are always ready for 
the transport of their heavy equipment and -
- the German equipment.  And in winter we 
shoveled snow because 
the climate in Poland 
was much more severe than we have it here.  And we were -- the roads have to be clear 
for the army to be moved. 
Q: Are we talking ab out summer and fall of 1940 or -- 

A: We are speaking -- no, of winter of 1939. 
Q: Oh. 
A: And the spring and fall and then -- 

Q: 1940. 
A: -- the winter in '40. 
Q: In '40.  And wh at was the name 
of the town that 
you were in then? 
A: __________ (Parcheetza).  
I lived -- I came back -- 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
9 
Q: Oh, th at was back to your town. 
A: Yes. 
Q: I see. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Oh, I see.  Okay.  So you were building roads. 

A: Building road s and cleaning 
roads of the snow.  Of course
 we, as I previously said, 
there were only two other Jewish family so th
e wo rkfo rce consisted of
 much more.  They 
brought Jews from adjacent villages and they 
were always ready to, we were ready to 
work on -- 
Q: Were you living at home at the time? 
A: Yes.  I was living at hom
e.  And those conditions were
 to about 1941, when the 
__________ (sounds like youthenlaut) in Stary Sacz was ordered to  select about 100 

young people from __________ (s
ounds like Ermitz) and to be
 sent to Rabka, R-A-P-K-
A: The time when we were told
 that we will go to this plac
e, we did not know what the 
function of our work will be. 

Q: What part of 1941 
was this, approximately? 
A: May. 

Q: In May.  Okay.  And you we
re one of these hundred  people. 
A: Yes, I was one of those people. 
Q: Are these all men? 
A: All men.  We arrived there sometimes in May. 

Q: Were you the only memb er of your family? 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
10 
A: I was the only member of my family becau
se -- well, maybe that's
 the best time to 
explain.  My  father was chosen by th
e man who was the _
_________ (sounds like 
guylighter) for this lumberyard
 as a necessary operator of th
is -- the German needed the 
lumber and the wheat, which -- 
so my father with my you
nger brother were working 
there.  So that's why they we
re not selected for any ordered 
transport.  But I went with 
this hundred  people to Rabka. 
Q: How far away was that? 
A: Oh, 40 kilometers. 

Q: How did you get there?   
A: On a train.  We got tickets. 
Q: So it was a passenger train? 

A: Passenger, passenger train. 

Q: Were you very  frightened? 
A: No, I was not frightened becau
se we did not know exactly 
what -- we thought that in 
this part of the country, th
ey need  young men for the same
 purpose as we were work ing 
previously because it was quite 
natural that they selected fro
m one part people to go to 
another part.  We were on their mercy.  Th
ey --  So when we a
rrived there on Monday 
morning, we found that this was an SS sc
hool to train young volunteer Ukraines to 
become SS.  The commandant of this school, 
by the name of Rosenbaum, greeted us with 
selecting one tenth of the transp
ort, ten people, and he shot in front of us the ten young 
healthy men.  It was -- this time it really, 
we realize that the Ge
rman mean what they 
were saying, that they have to
 destroy the Jews.  We lived 
there in Rabka.  The Jewish 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
11 
community of this Rabka was assigned to prov
ide food and sh elter for us.  And we lived 
there and went to the school.  That was a ve
ry short walk, maybe ten minutes' walk, every 
morning.  We walked there in the beginning.
  We built a shooting gallery, digging in the 
mountain and preparing the war fo r -- a shooti
ng gallery they built there to train the new 
recruits how is the most efficient way to sh
oot.  But after about four weeks spending th e 
time there, the adjacent town
, ghettos, were to be liqui
dated and the people were 
transported to Rabka.  And Ro senbaum had a 
couple actions.  And th
en we really knew 
what were our duty were there.
  We were gravediggers a
nd we bury all people which 
were killed. 
Q: They had these 
actions in Rabka. 
A: In Rabka in this particular mountai
ns earlier where the school was there. 
Q: And you said you were a gravedigger. 
A: Yes.  The other 90, 90 young men, because
 there were 90 in the beginning, but later 
on, seven of us, of the group escaped.  An
d to punish the rema in of us, he took 21 and 
hang.  So there were only left
 about 65 or maybe 70. Life th
ere was, I find that the first 
came in Rabka gave mu
ch deeper impression on us than 
the large camps or were much 
more people killed in Auschwitz but more 
vivid things I remember from Rabka because 

this comma ndant spent time.  We have seen
 him every minute of the day and sometimes 
if he felt lik e, he came to the camp, woke 
us up, and direct us running all around the 
place.  And his specialty, he had a reitpeitsch
e, that's a w h ip, and if he didn't like 
someone, he hit them from the back.  He cu
t his eye or -- and by th e next action, you 
were marked that you will be shot.  So it was 
quite hard for a young 
man to live with this 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
12 
hanging all the time. 
Q: You had said that the Jewish comm
unity was giving you fo od and shelter. 
A: Yes. 

Q: So were you living at the camp , 
though?  You had said you were -- 
A: Well, the school was about ten minutes away from the -- 

Q: Town? 
A: From the quarters where we lived. 
Q: So you didn't  live with
 other Jewish families. 
A: No.  It was made as a small camp, only we
 had guards on the gate where we lived.  It 
was three small buildings. 

Q: Uh-huh.  You slept in barracks? 

A: No, no, we slept in the -- 
originally there were Jewish 
buildings, maybe two family in 
each.  So there were, let's say, eight rooms in  each quarters.  So 
put 24 people in each 
room.  Slept on the floor, slept on the beds. 
 But that was a sma
ll, very small camp, 
consisting of 70, 65 people. 

Q: And what about the food situation? 
A: The food situation?  The Jewish communi
ty had to  provide it.  There was somebody 
who cooked and when we came 
-- in the mo rning we got a ration of bread and a coffee.  
And in th e evening when we came b
ack to our quarters, we got a soup. 
Q: Nothing in the middle of the day? 
A: No, nothing in the middle of the day. 

Q: And what were you wear
ing?  Your own clothes? 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
13 
A: We wear our own clothes, which we brou
ght from home.  Every four weeks or so, we 
got a pass to go home, ten each. 
 Each week on a Saturday he
 permit us to go home, ten 
of us.  Then we waited for our turn.  And Su
nday afternoon we came back.  It was a short 
ride on a train from time -- from 
the place where we were living. 
Q: Did you have to wear any iden tif
ying signs showing you were Jewish? 
A: We -- the clothes were only painted yellow 
stripes.  In the beginning, it was not -- oh, 
yeah, we had the, every Jew 
had to wear the Mogen David 
on the white with the blue 
thing.  But otherwise, in the beginning, it 
was not required in th
e small camps, work 
camps, to be any way else identified. Well, 
this lasted for about 
two months or th ree 
months.  And we heard that the ghetto in St
ary Sacz, because eventu ally my  parents were 
also moved from the village wher
e we lived to a ghetto, Stary 
Sacz, that the ghetto going 
to be liquidated and everybody 
going to go -- be sent. So on 
this particular week, we all 
got the permit from R o senbaum to 
go home to say goodbye to 
our families.  I don't really 
know if our parents knew ex
actly the condition because we 
did not share every brutality 
as what happened to us and wh
at we have seen to the pare
nts, at least I will speak for 
myself.  I felt that there's no 
point to burden the parents what
 is going on with us.  They  
had en ough problems of their own.  So I di
d not share too much.  I went with general 
ideas, what's going on, 
that -- but I did not inform them. 
 They knewthat
 they killed ten 
of us because ten never came home.  But what 
we were doing, that we were gravediggers 
and we buried people, I did not share this with
 them.  But there was a general feeling that 
more or less they knew that 
they will go to so me camp.  An
d Sunday, when 
we had to go 
back home, my father took 
the group, because we still ha
d a couple horses, from the 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
14 
ghetto to  the train station.  It was not a long 
ride but it was mu ch better to give us a ride 
than we should walk because there was no othe
r way to get there.  So he came there to 
say goodbye to us.  And I said 
goodbye to him already and went 
back almost to the train.  
And in th e last minute, I decide to go back
 and I jump ed over the fence, because by the 
train station there was a fence, to say anothe
r goodbye to my fathe
r.  And the SS guard 
saw me and started beating me.  And it's not
 the pain of my  -- what hurt me but the 
feeling of my  father, who was he
lpless, that he could not help
 anything to his son.  That 
was more painful. Buteventually we got away.  And a fe
w weeks later we found out that 
the ghetto from Stary Sacz was sent to Trebli
nka.  We knew very well what Treblinka 
was.  Treblinka was just a camp where people went to be killed, gassed. Meanwhile, 
those actions in Rabka continue in mu ch bigge
r pace than originally because apparently 
they felt that this part of 
Poland has to ____________ (yout
henlate) -- euthanized (please 
check) and they will have 
to kill more.  So then
 it was almost every day that he created an 
action. Rosenbaum, when the grav es were re
ady, dug, we dug almo st from the mo rning 
into like 4:00, then he 
inspected all those, if they're larg
e enough.  Then 
we went to the 
quarters, where we lived.  We had some food
.  And we were ordered in the evening to 
come back and watch the actions
.  He grouped the people by th
e graves.  They  had to be 
disrobed, put the clothes on the side, and stay  by
 the ditch.  He generally gave the SS men 
some whiskey and -- oop, sorry -- gave an order 
to shoot.  Take this away?  No.  After the 
graves were filled, we had to throw the dirt
 with some disinfecta
nt.  And next morning 
we cut the -- make like sod from further away
 and brought cover, that there was no, any 
evidence that there were graves there. 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
15 
Q: Were there men and wo men together? 
A: To be killed? 
Q: To be killed? 
A: Yes.  Men and women together and children 
that were killed.  On
 one action he killed 
a fami ly which lived  in Rabka by the name of
 Rosenbaum.  He found out that the people 
beared the same name as him.  Then he wa
s -- he felt that it was -- the son had his name 
so he tried to kill them.  Of course --  

Q: What was the commandant's
 first name?  Do you know? 
A: Some place I have the -- 
Q: Okay . 
A: In those -- 

Q: Okay.  It's all right. 

A: -- newspaper clipping because 
-- all right.  Yeah, that, I will 
have to come.  After three 
or four months, I was sent from Rabka to Krak
ow.  Krakow at this particular time was 
still a ghetto.  We lived in gh
etto for about four weeks. 
Q: Are you talking about the fall of '41 or -- 
A: That was in fall '41, yeah, or early wi
nter.  Lived there for about four weeks. 
Q: How did you get there? 

A: I was transported.  He got -- Rosenbaum se
nt two trucks filled up, with us on top.  
Krakow from Rabka was very, a short distance. 

Q: Did you go with a whol
e group of young men? 

A: Yes.  Part -- half of the camp from Rabka wa
s sent to Krakow.  Bu t I would like to go 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
16 
back to Rosenbaum.  In 1968, he came back
 home to Hamburg and he told th e German 
authority that he's  back from 
the war, he was in the Wehrmach
t, that's the army, and he 
likes to get a pension from the German govern
ment.  When I arrived to United States, I 
register for Wiedergutmachung to the -- from 
German and I got all the -- I gave this 
organization all the information, which cam
ps I spent and what the name of the 
commandant were there.  So they contac
ted the German -- the German authority 
contacted, apparently, the Jewi
sh organization and they  got 
my  name.  And they send me, 
first, the prosecutor from the 
trial sent me a telegram if 
I am willing to come and first 
recognize -- they show me pictures of him a
nd I recognize him, if 
I am willing to go to 
Hamburg to testify to his tria
l. In the beginning, I was quite
 hesitant because it was only 
'68.  I started -- I was married.  I had two 
young children.  And to renew the wo unds was 
quite hard for me.  But after discussion with
 my  wife, we decide that it's my  duty, 
because there was really, there were only th
ree left from the whole group who were in 
Rabka who could testify as witnesses to his atrocities.  S o  we went to Hamburg and 

testified.  I had my  wife and my  two ch ildren,
 then I had only tw o, right now I have three 
children, to Germany and I, I testified for, I thi
nk, three days there to his trial.  And, I 
don't know, I had a feeling when  I was in camp
 with him that he was a big statue, big, 
heavy-built man.  After I met hi
m on the witness stand, he was just a normal, small -- so 

apparently  his authority of life and death, wh
ich he had make in our mind, the statue so 
big.  And he got convicted and he got life in pr
ison.  I don't know.  I didn't follow th is up, 
if he's  still alive or he's out of his -- but at 
least that was a satisfaction, that, after all, he 
killed enough Jews but he did not kill everyb
ody.  There were some who could witness 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
17 
his -- and give witness to the future generatio
ns.  And he was punished.  Of course I don't 
feel that the punishment was -- met the crime but
 here at least he was punished.  And then 
I -- with the Germans, 
the young people, I have to say th
at at this time when we were 
there, we were treated quite nice.  And the Ge
rmans had, at the time when we were there, 
some also guilt feeling because they, I presum
e they had to ask the fathers where were 
your grandfathers at this pa
rticular time, what didyoudo 
during th e war.  So there was 
some, I don't know, maybe I'm not -- I had some symp athy with them. 
Q: Let's go back to when you were 
-- you were sent to Krakow, you said. 
A: Yeah.  We're going
 to go b
ack, yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

A: We were sent to Krakow because appare
ntly the authorities there, knowing that we 
already experience for months how to build th
e quarters for -- because first we had to 
build a couple barracks for the SS there.  So
 they decided they're 
going to build a camp , a 
war camp near Krakow by the name of Plaszo
w.  For about two or three weeks, we 
walked ev ery day, a group of us, from Krak
ow and then there was another detachment 
from the ghetto to Plaszow to 
prepare for the camp because 
that's w h ere -- their way to 
build  the camp.  They had -- apparently, they 
wanted to eventually 
evacuate the Krakow 
ghetto and the people who lived 
in the ghetto will be sent
 to the camp.  Krakow -- 
Plaszow, rather, at those days had anot
her commandant than this __________ (sounds 
like get) who was portrayed in Schindler's Li
st because that is th e same camp as is 
portrayed in Schindler's List.  Well, thos
e days we knew there are many different 
industrialists who were renting the Jewish 
labor from the camp of Krakow, Plaszow, but 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
18 
we did not pay too much attention about Schi
ndler.  We knew he had -- that there were 
some people who wo rked in his part.  There we
re parts in the pants factory.  Bu t later on 
when it was already close to evacuate Krakow
 and Schindler tried to organize a larger 
group, we knew that people who, either who liv
ed in ghetto or prev iously  who had some 
means to get on the list, I never -- in Krakow 
I was quite already, wh at did you call this 
then, Muselmann.  In other words, I was not ve
ry healthy.  I just wo rk.  Because the work 
was very, very hard.  I --  By the end, after a 
year and a half work ing 
just with the digging 
ditches and building barracks, I w as transfer
red to a carpenter's  factory because a man 
who was in charge of the carpenter's factory 
was acquain tance of my  father.  And after he 
found out that I'm there in
 Krakow, he took me in. 
Q: What were your living conditions like in Krakow? 
A: In Krakow they were very, very poor 
because there were very -- we built these 
barracks quite quickly.  And we slept there th
ree rows high, like you have here in this 
mu seum, how th e sleeping, we slept on wo od three story high. 

Q: This is in Krakow or Plaszow? 

A: Plaszow, Plaszow. 
Q: No, no.  But wh en  you were living 
in Krakow, what we
re the conditions? 
A: Well, that was a very short time and we spent very little time -- 
Q: In the ghetto. 
A: -- in the ghetto.   
Q: You went right to Plaszow. 

A: We -- that was the purpose of bringing 
us to Krakow ghetto, to build , to show th e

19 
people how to build  a camp.  Because 
we were the experienced carpenters. 
Q: So you're sleeping in the barrack s in Plaszow. 
A: After we built two or three barracks, we did no
t go no more to ghetto
.  We slept there.  
We built a kitchen.  And one of the -- was se
lected to cook.  He was never any, had 
knowledge of cooking but, you know, you learn 
quickly.  In Krakow, I spent about two 
years.  In 1944, (inaudible) '44, one mo rni
ng -- I worked on the ni
ght shift because they 
work ed, people who wo rked  day and night.  There were two -- 
Q: This is in the carpentry? 

A: In the carpentry, right. 
Q: Were you getting enough food? 
A: The food were almost, in every camp they
 were the same.  You 
got, in the morning, 
four ounces of black bread a
nd a pint of coffee.  And in  
the evening you got a pint of 
watery soup.  If you have any means, like 
people who lived in Krakow previo usly, who 
brought from the ghetto something, because it 
was possible to smuggle stuff, then they 
had, for money or gold or diamonds, there were  a way to buy.  But as
 I previously stated, 

I was quite down in my 
life in Krakow.  So -- 
Q: Were you wearing, still wearin g your own -- 

A: Still wearing civilian clothe
s and still just yellow paint. 
Q: A stripe on your clothes. 
A: A stripe on th e clothes.  And no mo re, 
even, no more, because this was a camp, no 
more white -- 
Q: Star? 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
20 
A: -- arm bands.  You see, through the whole 
thing, I feel somehow 
that was luck.  If I 
say that I was sent from Krakow to Au schwit
z was luck, it was, to me, because we -- oh, 
I skipped.  When we were rea
dy to go to the barr
acks on this one particular morning -- 
Q: This is in Plaszow. 
A: In Plaszow -- the guards took us on the 
appellplatz and we di
dn't know what, what 
was wrong.  We were not permitted to go 
to our barracks no more.  We were put in 
different barracks and the guards were all ar
ound.  Rumors came.  I mean, we heard from 

the Jewish inmates who were in the police, Je
wish police, that we 
will go to Auschwitz.  
But we heard already what Ausc
hwitz was and we were prepared
 for the worst.  We told -
- 

Q: How had you heard? 

A: Well, people who were living in Krakow-Pla
szow, they were working on certain, with 
certain groups, went outside, out of town
, of the camp, and wo
rked with the Polish 
civilians, who were masons, carpenters, or 
other -- so it came through th e grapevine that 
Auschwitz was a camp where people mo stly go to  be gassed.   

And the condition of our health
 was such that we already were resigned, well, you're 
gonna die, you're gonna die, what else ca
n you do.  There's nothi
ng else you could do.  
After two days spent there in this barrack, fi
nally we were, one evening we were put on a 
train and the -- 

Q: How many people were with you? 
A: It was 225. 

Q: And this was when?  This was -- 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
21 
A: Late in '43. 
Q: You were put on a train.  What kind of train? 
A: Cattle train. 
Q: Cattle train. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you said your health was not good. 
A: Not good.  I was very weak already.  A
nd when we came to Krakow -- to Auschwitz -
- 
Q: How long did it take? 
A: It took maybe two, three hours.  That's al
l.  That's short distance.  Also, Auschwitz 
was on a Polish territory and originally 
Auschwitz was built to accommodate Polish 
political prisoners. To my knowledge, after I wa
s liberated, I tried to research, I could not 
find any other transport which came directly to
 the central, to the center of the camp.  

Generally, all the transports ca
me to Birkenau, where there we
re selection made to go to  
work  or to go to  the gas chamber.  This pa
rticular transport of 225 from Krakow came 
directly to the central camp, where there we
re 20 blocks.  There 
were two-story brick 
build ings.  On 16 blocks people
 lived who were sent to do 
outside work .  Every mo rning 
they came back to wo
rk .  One block had a hospital.  
One block was a bunker wh ere all 
prisoners who tried to escape 
and they were caught, they we
re put there.  And one block 
was the experimental b lock. So 
we came there to Auschwitz -- 
Q: What happened when
 the train stopped? 
A: When  the train stopped, the 
SS opened th e gates of the --  

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
22 
Q: The doors?  
A: Doors of the train and let us out.  We 
were met there immediately  by the inmates who 
were in Auschwitz for a longer time with th
e blue and wh ite stripe
s and numbers on their 
-- 

Q: Jacket? 

A: -- jackets with the different
 angles because the political, th
ey wore red.  And the Jews 
had a red and yellow star.  And there were al
so with the green Ge
rman that -- well, I 
mean, should we go over this?  That 
is well k n own, what they were.   
And they told us that we are in Auschwitz.  
Shaved our heads.  We took a shower and get 
tattooed and put the tattoo on
 the arm.  We spent -- 
Q: Do you remember wh
at you felt like at th at point, your thoughts? 

A: Well, the condition after that was alrea
dy three years I went thro ugh from one to 
another.  You were so conditioned, that what
ever will happen, will 
happen.  You did not 
dwell too mu ch wh at you gonna do.  You start 
to believe in fate already.  There's nothing 
mu ch you can do.  You better don't think too mu
ch.  Just watch yourself.  Not to be too 
close to somebody who gonna hit 
you or beat you or whatever. 
 You just try to be in the 
background and maybe. I had a very strong urge
 then when I arrived 
in Auschwitz that if 
there's any chance to su rvive, after what I went 
through, I'll have to survive.  And, I don't 
know -- a good thing, th ough, th at we were 
there on the quarantine.  Each transport who 
come, was, I think, the whole week  we didn 't
 do anything.  We could not get out from the 

block.  We got fo od like normal, four ounces 
of black bread, coffee, black coffee, and in 
the evening you got a so
up. But it was known to the rest of
 the inmates that the transport 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
23 
from Krakow came here.  So there were some
 people who were already longer in the 
camp who were interested always to find maybe 
their brothers or whoever is family.  So 
they came and tried to ascertain who -- the 
names and everything else. So after a while, 
someone somehow to ld the friend of mine who I 
lived  and went to scho
ol with that I am 
here, you know.  So  he came visit me and br
ought me more food. 
 And then after the 
quarantine, in the beginning, he arranged a 
good work group for me.  I work far.  We 
walked ev ery today.  Bu t it was indoors. 
Q: What block number 
were you living in ? 
A: 18A.  And ev ery so often, he 
came, visit me, and helped me out. 
Q: What kind of wo rk
 were you doing? 
A: I was working in  a steam producing -- my  
duty was they had a bi
g, big oven and that 
was a factory for cabinets and they brought pi
eces of wood and I threw in the -- to create 

steam.  It w as very easy work and warm.  No
 elements o f cold weather go through and 
everything.  So if I wouldn't  have lived ther
e -- I mean through this
 period of, I think I 
was in Auschwitz four, five months, that's w h ere I came  to mo re strength, because when  

Auschwitz was liquidated in 19 -- 
Q: Liberated. 
A: Liquidated.  Before -- the Russians were ve
ry close so they want
ed to send everyone 
who was in camp away.  I was almost on the la
st transport.  It was already middle of 
December, in winter.  And they did not, they 
could not spare any truc
ks or wagons.  So 
we marched for two days and two nights.  If 
I wouldn't have the strength in Auschwitz, I 
could not surviv e the march.  For two days a
nd tw o nights we walk thro ugh the snow and 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
24 
there were, I would imagine it was maybe 
one tenth of the marchers survived.  
Everybody else who could not
 keep up with  them going was shot by the guard s, who 
were riding on the mo to rcycles. 

Q: Were you with -- was it just men on your march? 

A: Yes, there was on the particular march was 
men.  And this particular -- in Auschwitz, 
on th e barracks -- I mean on the blocks, it wa
s only men.  In Au schwitz, in the central 
lager, there were only women who were secretarie
s but they did not live 
in this particular 
camp.  But a very strange thing, what I still 
cannot have answered 
to what happened on 
this march, sometimes 
during the march, there was an E
nglish military plane going quite 
low over our heads.  And the 
Germans, the guard s got panicky and started to run away  
from us.  And how we were cond
itioned through th is four years, we could not decide for 
ourselves what to do.  So we
 followed them.  We knew very 
well that there is no way to 
escape because we were with this blue and wh
ite stripes.  It's winter.  You could not 
disrobe yourself.  And you could not go to 
a German house.  But it is just that the 
conditioning thro ugh so many ye
ars, you did not function by you
rself.  You had to get an 
order.  We didn't  get the order to go aw ay 
-- go turn right; we followed the guards.  And 
it is quite puzzling to  me how a human being 
can be conditioned to do th ings against their 
will.  So finally -- 
Q: How many were in your group?  
How many people were
 on your march? 
A: Well, it's very hard for me
 to determine how many people.  It was a long, long line of 
people wh en we started.  Only  the histor
ian can decide that the march started in 
Auschwitz and how many people 
came here and there becaus
e it's -- you know, it was 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
25 
quite -- I mean, I don't know if this is a ni
ce way to talk about ou
r way but everyone was 
only concerned ab out himself.  You did not care 
what's going on there in the front.  You 
didn't  care what's going on on
 the left side.  Y ou were onl
y hoping that you will survive, 
so. But that was the condition. 
 And you had to appa
rently adjust to 
the condition, what 
they were.  And maybe it 's, l ike today, it 's
 not too good to dwell too much what -- how 
we behaved because, I mean, I don't know -- fi
nally we arrived in 
a small town in, on 
some border of Poland and Germany a
nd th ey gave us a big farmhouse. 
Q: Were any of the German soldiers w
ith you or was it just the survivors? 
A: No, no.  There were all German  -- I m
ean the guards -- afte
r the, after the --  
Q: You were still with the guards. 

A: After the plane left and they came back 
and we marched again.  So after we -- they 
give us a rest for overnight.  We rest there, 
slept there in this barn, and next morning we 
were loaded  on some trains.  And, well,
 we didn't know where 
we were going but we 
arrived in Buchenwald.  In
 Buchenwald, we were placed
 on this block for young 
children.  I mean, at least I 
was placed there.  And in 19
45, in Buchenwa
ld, in this 
particular camp, in the old camp, we were not 
required to do any work
.  Just they brought 
us there to be stored if th
ey need someplace else.   
End of File One 
Beginning File Two 
Q: You were talking about how you
 had arrived in Bu chenwald?  

A: Yes.  We arrived in Buchenwald    at
 those times, already 1945, or might be '44, 

December, and Buchenwald was already in di
sarray.  There were many people brought 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
26 
there because the place was still more or le
ss secure from the allie
s.  I was put on the 
young man's block an d this block became qu
ite famous by Elie Wiesel's book, "The 
Night" wh ere he speaks about Gustav, who was 
the blockalteste.  I lived there and during 
the day we were not required to go to any work
.  It is just that onc
e in a while food got 
more scarce.  Instead of ever
y day the rations what we were
 supposed to get, we got 
every second day.  But they to
ld us, if you volunteer on a
ny transport to another camp, 
you might get more food.  But somehow, I decide
 that I will stay there, at least I know 
what's going on here, I don't want to volunt
eer for any unknown situation.  So time was 
very hard to pass, because we 
did not do anything, and as I 
said previously, the food got 
scarce, but we tried to live from day to 
day.  Close by end of March     
Q: Did you have any contact with th
is Gustav, whom you mentioned?  
A: Well, he was my  blockalteste.  He was in ch
arge of th e block and he    the Jewry (ph), 
the book about what Elie Wiesel w as not 
very    he    but    ok      
Q: You described your experiences with him?  

A: My experience I felt that th
e man did the best he could 
under those circumstances.  
You cannot please everybody all the time.  T h e 
man tried to do good 
for the majority.  If 
he hurt someone sometimes then I feel    
beca use I thought about 
this quite many years 
now.  How we surviv ors someti
mes handle the people who got th e jobs of a kapo to be in 
charge.  Not always they did the best in my
 opinion what in their position required.  The 
one who criticize, let him put himself someti
mes in a position of the other one.  You 
know    they were required 
to do certain things by the Ge
rman authorities 
there and they 
had to do, otherwise they would be puni
shed.  And    so in April     

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
27 
Q: In April? 
A: In April, the English and the American
 Army  was quite close, we could hear 
sometimes at night when there was quiet, quiet
, the explosion of high    the bomb s or 
whatever it was.  

Q: Up to  that point you said you really 
didn't do anything you just waited around?  
A: Yes, just waited around, yes.   
Q: And your health was ok at that point?  
A: Considering the situation we 
didn't have to wo rk th e health 
was pretty good.  But     
Q: In Ap ril you heard bomb s?  
A: We heard bombs.  The rumors started going 
that the army    th
e allies are very close 
and soon they're going to come
 to Buch enwald.  And we we
re informed that the camp 
going to be evacuated.  For about 
a week before we were liberated we didn't g et any food.  
So you    it was early spring, so we ate wh
atever we could find on the outside because 
there were quite grassy molds 
(ph) there so we took the grass and ate and sometimes we 
took some water with the grass and cooked 
look a soup.  You had to somehow surviv e 
because there was    yes, they
 tried to induce people to leav
e and they say that if you are 
going to  go out from the camp, you are going to get more rations.  
Q: Who tried to induce you, the Germans?  

A: The German authorities.  
Q: Tried to encourage you to leave?  

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
28 
A: Tried to encourage you to 
leave, and later we found out 
that all those people who fell 
for that, they were taken to 
next town and were shot ther
e, where they were prepared 
already for    well I mean, I    
Q: But you decided to  stay?  

A: I decided to stay.  But I still cannot underst
and.  They had the powe
r if they wanted to 
do th is, to come and say a thousand of you come
 with us and we woul
d have to go.  So  I 
mean it is not my personal knowledge that th
at would have happened, but that's what we 
were told.  Anyway, one morni
ng we heard those shots very loud and a few minutes later 
we had seen  the American Army  came to the camp .  In the first group it was a young 
chaplain, Rabbi Schacter, who wh
en he saw what's going on there, it didn't take him long, 
he organized a transport of young people wh o th
eir health was not very good.  Half    the 
first transport when to France.  On this pa
rticular transport Elie Wiesel was sent to 
France.  The next transport he organized to
 Switzerland through th
e world Red Cross and 
I went to Switzerland.  
Q: When you were in the camp did you 
know Elie Wiese l, had you met him?   

A: I'm sure I met him, but I didn't know    
we were not formal, we never told the second 
name. Maybe I met him as Elie who was sleepi
ng above me, no, I don't know.  When  I    
I just have seen him last Su
nday, he spoke in th
e temple where my daughter lives, and I 
spent quite a few minutes with him to talking about
 different things    it's not the first time 
I talk to him, but you know    who knew.  

Q: So generally when survivor
s spoke in the camps they did 
not give their last names?  
A: Well, if I met you, let's say you
 were inmate with me     

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
29 
Q: No.  I meant during the time of 
the war, I meant during the war?   
A: Yes, why? 
Q: You just said your first names? 
A: Yeah.  People didn't know each other by 
second name.  I mean
, if you looked for 
somebody th en something else but it's just casual     

Q: A new person?  
A: Casually if you sleep next to somebody
, I don't know the second name.  It wasn't 
important, I mean, besides in Au schwitz that was comp letely different.  The names didn™t 
mean anything. The numbers. We were called by 
the numbers and we did not    the same  
thing in Buchenwald.  I had my    there we
re numbers printed here.  There were numbers. 
The Germans communicate to us 
by th e name if they want    by the number, not by the 
names. The names were registered there but the numb ers were the important thing.  So  if 

you did not reme mb er your nu
mber, you were dead.  If they 
called your number and you 
did not respond immediat
ely, you got punished .  
Q: Do you reme mb er your number?  

A: Auschwitz was 1740609.  As a matter of 
fact, I mean, I don 't know how important it 
is, but it's just curious because now we hear about this    that th
ese young mengonna get 
flagging    when I marched to the camp, 
to Auschwitz from my  work , one day somebody 
gave me two eggs because we carried those ca
nteens with soup. So I had two eggs.  Eggs 
were very valuable in camp.  I would have
 gotten something in cam
p for that.  So the 
guard  randomly looked, he said, "open it."  He
 looked in my  canteen
 and started stirring 
with his stick and he fo und the eggs so I 
was selected on a side.  My number was taken 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
30 
and I would have gotten 25 lashes.  But fortunately fo r me the camp was liquidated and 
they didn't have enough time 
to do this.  So you know it
's very hard to condense 
everything.  You know, I'm just going with at
 th e mo me n t  wh at comes to  my  h ead  I find  

important.  

Q: You were then taken to Switzerland, you said?  

A: Yeah.  Well, we were sent to Switzerland.  
Q: Because of Rabbi Schacter?  
A: Rabbi Schacter organized a transport, yes.
  Rabbi Schacter I me
t a few times here, he 
spoke to us many times.  He lives in Brooklyn.  
Q: What's  his first name?  
A: Herschel Schacter.  

Q: And what were you thoughts when 
you were on your way to Switzerland?  
A: Well, finally we were liberated.  I lived on
ly in Germany for, I th
ink, in June, by the 
end of June, so that's  only two, three months
.  But befo re I gonna go to the thoughts of 
the German    the American Army after have 
seen what happened to  us there they went to 
next town, that's Weimar and they confiscate
d    first they brought wagons with water, 
because we didn't have no more water.  We 
didn't take no showers, we didn't take no 
baths, so they gave us baths.  We walked 
fo r, I think, two days without clothes, naked, 
everything, because that was more sanitary th
an wearing those old, 
lousy clothes.  They 
burnt everything wh at we were wearing.   
Q: This is while you 
were in Buchenwald?  
A: Yes. 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
31 
Q: After liberation? 
A: Liberation, yes.  They 
went outside to Weimar and 
they brought so
me food, the 
American Army.  They confiscated pigs and 
chicken and everything else and they came 
and they  start cooking and they  gave us -- 
and that was not very 
good th ing because we 
didn't  eat for so many weeks and now we got 
the food and many of us got really sick, 
diarrhea and type of illness from overeating.  So 
then they got the rati
ons of soldiers that 
also donated chocolate, the choc
olate helped us.  But, see, 
those soldiers did not expect 
the condition what occurred th
ere, and they were just
 trying to help us.  
Q: What language di
d you speak then?  
A: What language?  German.  To Rabbi Schacter we spoke Yiddish.  

Q: Growing up wh at did you sp eak in your house? 

A: Polish.  So that was also
 a good thing that I knew a little
 Yiddish.  And Yiddish was -- 
and I went to school to Gymnasium that 
was a little (inaudible) learn a little German, 
because the guards at the commandant gave orde
rs in German, and if
 you did not respond 
to the order that was not in favor either.  So
 you had to quick ly   
 you had to  learn the 
German.  That's why the transport that ca
me to Auschwitz from Greece, those Jews 
suffered greatly because at l
east the European Jews unders
tand a little bit Yiddish and 
they could respond after a while to the orde
rs.  But the Greek had 
a very hard time to 
understand the language and they 
were very quickly killed.   
Q: So you were on yo
ur way to Switzerland after the     
A: After the transport organized, Rabbi Scha
cter came with us to Switzerland.  We 
arrived at some Red Cross quarters in Be
rn and then the Je
wish community of 

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
32 
Switzerland were helping us.  Some Jewish
 organization, the Zi
onist organization, 
because originally we went to
 Switzerland just for a little he
alth and then go to Israel, 
because that's the only place we 
could go.  We did no
t want to go back
 home to Poland, 
because we heard about the seven who escape
d, escaped the Germans.  They came home 
and they didn't live lo ng because 
there is one who survived who is in Israel told us    
because I met him th ere to the trial    he 
was the one who escaped,
 six, the poles came 
with hatchet and killed them.  So we did no
t want to go back to 
Poland and there was no 
other place to go, so we decided to go to 
Switzerland and then go to Israel.  B u t 
unfortunately England ha
d a blockade to Israel and Sw itzer
land did not permit    we could 
have gone on our own through 
the borders of Italy, but th
at's whole thing was illegally 
and we felt    at least the whole group 
who was in Switzerland from Buchenwald, we 
decided that we had enough smuggled th
en, whatever will be 
when there will be 
permitted to go here or there we will go.  So 
friends of my parents    my name    our 
names were published in Jewish papers in   
 I suppose, through th e whole wo rld but here 
we speak about in Un
ited States.  And one day I recei
ved a letter from friends of my 
parents who came here much earlier to United 
States, if I am willin g to come to United 
States they will send me papers.  I decided   
 I grabbed the opportunity and I came to the 
United States in 1947.  
Q: 1947?  So you were in 
Switzerland up to that point? 
A: Two years, yes. 

Q: Two years in Switzerland.  Then where 
did you come when  you
 got to the Unites 
States?   

Interview with Henry Kolber 
 
33 
A: I came to Irvingt
on, New Jersey?  
Q: And when did you get married?  
A: 1950.  
Q: And you stayed in Ne
w Jersey ever since?  

A: All    ever since in New Jersey, yes.  

Q: Is your wife a survivor also?  
A: No.  My wife's  born here, she was born in Brooklyn. 
Q: Can we talk about some general questions 
now about your thoughts and your feelings 
and your experiences?  How do you 
think the war influenced you?  
A: The war influenced me very, 
very negatively.  My    I'm still looking fo r answers to 
the questions.  Where was the world?  Wher
e was the Je wish comm
unity  of the United 
States where we were there?  Today we kno
w that was well known in 1942 that what 
Hitler was doing with the Jews.  
It is known also that when
 Eichmann came to Hungary, 
because Hungary was the last bastion of Je
ws, the Jewish community in Hungary saved 
about 10,000 Jews for money.
  And they were paid and wh en they  were asked United 
States government or United St
ates Jewish community were 
asked to donate mo re money 
for some reason, somehow, it was not forthcom
ing.  So su re the blame lies directly on 
those people who helped Hitle
r or Germany, but the num
bness of the world, of the 
demograp hic committee in United States, I s
till cannot understand.  A ship of German 
refugee came here to this shores and 
was turned around and sent back.   
Q: Uh huh.   

Interview with Henry Kolber

A: When we were in Auschwitz, it's only a 
very short distance 
where there are Buna 
workers -- that was industrial
 area for a military purpose 
where (inaudible).  It was 
bombed.  Why they  never threw at least one
 or two bomb s at the trains which were 
coming to Auschwitz with the people who di
ed?  We were reali
zed the people would 
have been killed, but 
they were killed anyway
.  But the crematoriums or the trains would 
be wrecked for a couple of days or weeks 
and at least the destru
ction would not have 
occurred as occurred.  
So Hitler did not hear really any 
opposition from no one.  So he 
continued to do wh at his goal was.  I get 
man y  questions, why the Jew resisted.   My 
answer to them is I resisted for every day,
 because his aim was to
 kill me and I am still 
alive.  So what resistan t would it be, I me
an I am speaking about my personal thing, 
would it have been better if I would escaped
 and hide someplace a
nd be killed later by a 
Pole and I knew from right from the beginnin
g we were told in Rabka, that you are 
responsib le for your neighbor, fo r your 
person who you are liv
ing or who you are 
working, if he escapes you be killed.  I ne
ver, never through the whole    my living in 
camps had any time, notion, of taking a life 
of somebody else on my  conscience.  There 
are different types of people.  I'm just sp
eaking fo r my self.  And I cannot, and I'm not 
sorry that I did not know
, that I did not do.  The next thing 
what happened in 
Buchenwald    
after the lib eration, the young army soldiers 
grabbed few of us who were near, and they  
immediately, after the marching they took
 the commandant, previous commandant from 
the camp, the Germans, with the guards, and put them there closed 
in the bunk.  They 

came to us and said, come with us, we show 
you something.  They to ok us to the bunker 
there and sh owed us SS lying 
there on the floor and said, ﬁyou want a gun, you want a

stick, do whatever you want.ﬂ  Yeah, very tr
ue, there were many of my inmates there who 
took their advantage, but I felt, 
an d that bothers me today, some
times, did I act the right    
I couldn't make my self to happ
en. Because I felt if I would do
 this to him, I would lower 
my self to this position of what he did to 
me.  So I don't know.
  An d  so metime s I 'm 
ashamed to tell this, that I was a coward.   
Q: How do you feel about be
ing Jewish, did it change be
cause of your experience?  
A: No.  It didn't change much.  As I previous
ly said I was never very religious and I am 
not today.  There were questions when  I wa
s much younger, where 
was G d, where this 
happened .  But I cannot blame this on G d or 
religion or whatever.  I accepted what had 
happened and I feel that maybe it always    
of suffering of some    something different 

comes.  I strongly feel 
that if the Holocaust did not exist, 
Israel would not exist either.  So 
I feel that maybe the world    to do so methi
ng, that it did not do du
ring the Holocaust, so 
gave us a country of our own.  
Q: How do you feel about
 getting war reparations? 
A: Reparations? 
Q: Yes. 
A: Despite what some people feel, I feel what
ever they    they ca
nnot pay me enough for 
what I went through and I will get anything they are willing to pay.  
Q: Have you communicated to your children 
about your experiences 
in the Holocaust?  
A: Well, that is also    just a few days be
fore I spoke with my  son who is now 42, he does 
not want too mu ch to hear to my  story.  He re
ads.  He looks for all the information, but he 
does not listen to me about the story.  He 
never    I sometimes 
volunteer    in the 

Interview with Henry Kolber

beginning, I did not want to speak my self, but 
later, a few years pass, I decide that I    
whoever wants to listen I'll speak.  And I sp
eak with schools, I 
speak with Hebrew 
schools, and congreg ations, I go to public sc
hools, and whatever.  
But my  daughter, yes 
she    I have one son who is
 42 and one son who is 25.  Th
e boys, for some reason don™t 
want it    when I start talking about some Ho
locaust, when  we have comp any they walked  
out.  So  the son told  me that he cannot sta
nd to listen what I went through, cause it hurts 
him, so that's  why. But the 
daughter for somehow, I can comm
unicate with her, I can talk 
to her.  
Q: Does the war still affect you any wa
y besides for what you already said?  
A: Well, yes it affects me    I mean for so 
many years I would like to go back  to Po land, 
to time where I was born and maybe next ye
ar I go because I also going to go to  

Buchenwald because 50 years wh
en I was liberated.  I feel th
at I have to complete the 
circle, the cycle has to be closed.  I resisted
 to go to Poland just 
purely that I will spend 
my  good money to give to the Po
les.  But there is something mo
re to it.  I have to see the 
place where I was born, how it is, and then put a 
lilt salt in their face th
at I survived.  So 
I'm going with my  brother in law and my  sister
 in law.  I asked my younger son to go, he 
doesn 't want to go.  He belongs to th e Hash
omer Hatzair, Jewish organizations which go 
every year    the young 
children go    he never 
wanted to go, but     
Q: When  did you hear about the memb ers of 
your family, about wh at happened  to  them?  
A: In Rabka.  Right in the beginning.  Right in
 the beginning, I knew, I knew.  I heard.  I 
did not have any factual evidence.  And 
many, many people don't  have no factual 
evidence.  That's  where 
they were burned, that's where th
e ashes are.  I mean, after all I

knew that after I was liberated in 1945 an
d five, ten years pass, and my  names were 
published all over.  I never heard anybody, w
ho from my  family, who knew something.  
So I had to face facts, a
nd it's already 
50 years.  
Q: Is there anything else you wanted to add?  
A: No, no, it's ok.   

Q: Well, thank you very mu ch
 for this interview.   
A: Thank you.
