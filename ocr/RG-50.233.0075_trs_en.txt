June 5, 1992 
Wa shington, DC 
 

A: My name  isArlette De Long.  I was born June
 15, 1937 in Brocourt, Fr ance.  My father was 
born in Romania.  Hr came  to Paris to study me di
cine.  My mother was born in Siberia.  She 

came also to Paris to study me dicine. That™s 
where they me t and ma rried. After me di cal --- 
 

Q: Could you please give their name s and --? 

 

A: My father ™s  name  is JosephVa l man,April 19, 1913.  My mot her is Fanny Fooks and she was 
bornAugust 28, 1910. They ma rried in Paris after 
they finished school and they were looking 
for a place to practice me dicine  because both of 
them were poor. They chose a village  in the 
north of France. When they arrived there, it 
was 1935 and there was something in the air. They 

felt that it wa s not very safe to announce they were Jews. 
 

Q: Can you explain, did they tell you what th
e ‚something in the air ™ , what it was ---? 
 

A: No, I think they were ---. We ll, my moth
er especially had been in Russia in Shetow______ 
during the revolution.  He r parents we re wealt
hy me rchants and when the revolution, they had 
to run abandoning property, seve
ral property in Shetow.  Just
 run with my grandmother ™s 
jewelry.  I think she felt fr om that time a lot of 
fear and was extremely suspicious of people.  I 
assume  that when she started hearing about what
 was going on in Germany, that she started to 
fear that it mi ght spread and kept
 being Jewish a secret.  She wa
s not religious. To her I think, 
being Jewish didn™t mean very much.  I have no 
idea what my  father thought.  But I know that 

they did not have any record that we were Jews. 
When I was born in ™37, the priest, I think they 
told the priest -- he gave us a fu
ll certificat e of baptism.  I went to chur ch fr om the time I went 
to school, I think.  From the age of five or so
 until at least ---, th
roughout the whole war and 
ma ybe after.  I don™t think they ev
er really thought 
about being Jews. 
 

Q: So you didn™t know when you were growing up that you were Jewish? 

 

A: I don™t know.  No, I was going to church.  I don™
t -- even I -- I think I ma y have known we were 
Jews because I suspect my parents talked about it around me .  Because -- I don™t know.  I 

suspect I ma y have had some  no
tion but I don™t know that it m
eant very much to me, what 
being a Jew is except it™s dangerous
.  But that --  yeah, I went to
 church.  I went to Catholic 
church and that was my religion. That™s what th
e God I  believed in there. That™s  how I grew 
up. 
 

Q: But were your pare
nts churchgoers also? 
 

A: No, they never went to church.  It 
was not terribly unusual for the village. 
 

Q: So you were two in 1939 and you were three in 1940. You don™t have any me mories of being -- 
German ---? 
 
A: Oh, yes.  Oh yes, because  the Germans lived with
 us in our village. We  were occupied.  I have 
a me mo here of singing OhTa nnenbaum to the Ge
rmans. The fi rst thing they did when they 
came to the village -- we lived in a sort of 
-- we had a big house, ____ big ,made of brick.  It 
was attached to another house, similar, to the 
left.  So we were -- we had those two houses 
touching each other.  In the hous
e to the left, lived an old la
dy.  I think after a while, the 
Germans took her house and ma de her go away.  I don™t know where.  I reme mber she had a 

garden with flowers and we had a 
vegetable garden, not muc h flowers.  She had all flowers.  So 
that I was close to the Germans, of c ourse, beca
use they were in the same  yard.  I mean we 
shared the yard. There was no wall.  I reme mber
 my mother telling me not to eat the candies 
they gave me  because they mi ght be poisoned.  Of
 course, to me it didn™t make much sense.  I 
guess, none of it ma de very much sense.  I don™
t reme mber being afraid
 especially of the 
Germans -- I reme mber the uniforms.  Eventually, 
they also took our house. They threw us out 

of the house and ma de us --.  So we moved in w
ith an old -- with a widow who had a big house.  
We  spent, I don™t know how long -- but until the war was over. 
 

Q: Do you remember being thrown out of your house? 

 

A: No, I don™t reme mber.   Nor do I reme mber comi
ng back.  I have me mories of not having -- we 
had enough food.  Nobody ever lacked food because
 we were a village and there were cows, 

there were chickens, there was everything you™d n
eed for basics.  But we didn™t have wool, we 
didn™t have shoes and I reme mber one time anAmer
ican soldier in a parachute fell down.  He 
was caught in the trees and he died.  People in 
the village got the parach
ute and I think I saw it 
because I reme mber blood on the white silk.  My
 mother gathered the thread and she had 
some one knit me  a sweater and it was horrible. 
 I hated that sweater with a vengeance.  I 

reme mber one day some body brought us oranges.  I don™t know where they came  from.  I had 

never seen an orange before and sardines.  
Also I reme mber when theAmericans came to 
liberate us, we -- they threw us chewing gum to 
the kids. They chewed the same  piece, I think, 
for weeks because it was a novelty. 
 

Q: All the Germans had left? 

 

A: No, the Germans were ma de prisone
rs. They stayed in the village. 
 

Q: On the spot? 

 

A: Ye s, there we re two tanks. Two tanks and th
e Germans were in the mi ddle and they threw their 
arms up in the air and threw th
eir weapons down.  My father pi
cked a great big revolver which 
he still has from that time. 
 

Q: Do you know the date that you we
re liberated by theAmericans? 
 

A: I don™t reme mber now. 

 

Q: When did you find out that you were Jewish? 

 

A: That™s a big problem for me .  I do not have 
very ma ny me mo ries.  I cannot -- I don™t know. The 

one thing I reme mber, I assume my parents told 
me  some thi ng, what I reme mber is being after 
the war we moved to Paris.  I was more than
 eleven years old.  I reme mb er the synagogue 
where my parents took me .  My father, especially
, had me  go.  I had to go, I didn™t have any 
choice.  I very much hated it. 
 

Q: You hated it? 

 

A: Oh,yeah. 

 

Q: You™re eleven, so that would be about 1948? 

 

A: ™48,™49. 

 

Q: You said your parents moved to Paris in ™49? 

 

A: Ye s.  No, I moved in ™47, they followed a year
 later in ™48. And then
 they joined a synagogue 
and led a more Jewish life. 
 

Q: You observed Sabbath and --? 

 

A: No, no. The y just went to th
e shul.  I think for the holidays or
 some thing like that. They were 
not observant at all. 
 

Q: You didn™t go to Jewish school? 

 

A: No.  But we observed the holidays and we fa
sted onYo m Kippur.  MostlyYo m Kippur, it seems 
like and the Passover. Those are the two holidays. 
 

Q: So there was never any sudden revelation 
to you after the war that you were Jewish 
______________? 
 

A: You know s o me thing must have happened but I cannot reme mber. 

 

Q: You don™t know why they left the village? 

 

A: Ostensibly, it was because the village had onl
y one small school where all the children were 
together from the age of seven to the age of f
ourteen. Of course my e
ducation in there was not 
excellent and my mother was worried that I coul
dn™t stay there if I wanted -- if I was going to 
college .  But this is not the true reason becau
se I could have gone to ________which was close 

and spent a week there and come  back home  fo
r the weekends. The real reason was that my 

mother really disliked the village very much.  She felt lost  in it.  She came -- she di dn™t  like the 

people.  She didn™t like to
 practice me dicine and --. 
 

Q: Why didn™t she like the people?  Just  because 
their background was so different from her own? 
 

A: Ye s.  She felt they were peasants and she ha
d nothing in common.  My fa ther, on the other side, 
very much liked it.  Liked it there, liked to be
 a doctor.  He was oneof these old fashioned 

doctors who go around.  He went aro
und by bicycle at first, then on a 
mo torcycle, then in a car.  
He taught me how to drive the car. When I was 
seven years old, he let me use the wheel.  He 

liked it there but he moved pr
etty mu ch against his will. 
 
Q: So your father was driving a car during the war? 

 

A: Oh, yes. Yeah, we had a car.  Even in the begi
nning of the -- there mi ght 
be a picture of it.  It 
was a big Maitron.  It was called 
a great big coach.  I reme mb er vi
vidly.  It was gray and it had 
the black on the side of it.  It had the black
 stepping place you know with
 rubber with lines like 
that.  It was a great big car. 
 

Q: And he could take that on his rounds? 

 

A: Ye s.  My mother took that car when we left
, just before the Ge rmans ca me, I guess.  Pe ople 
were just leaving, running away from the German
s.  So she went down south towards Brittany, 
towards San _______. Then there were a lot of bom
bings apparently.  I don™t  recall much about 
it at all.  But my first me mory is being unde
r a table with my grandmother holding on to my 
sleeve.  I wanted to run out and she wa s hanging on to me . 
 

Q: That was in Brittany?  

 

A: Ye s. That was during the evacuation. 

 

Q: Oh, so your village was evacuated 
when the German ar my first came in? 
 

A: I don™t think the village, I think some  people left. 

 

Q: Who could get away? 
 
A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And you we nt with your grandparents? 

 

A: And my  mother. 

 

Q: Your grandparents were
 your mother ™s  parents? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: They joined her from Russia? 

 

A: Ye s, they came  in ™36. After --they were no lo
nger in Russia.They left at the Revolution and 
went to Harbin where there was a large Ru
ssian population. Then my gra ndmother --- 
 

Q: Is that  in France? 

 

A: Harbin?  No, it™s in China. 

 

Q: Habeen? 

 

A: Ye s,H-a-r- b-i-n. 

 
Q: Is that near Shanghai?   Because 
I know a lot of Jews were there (?) 
 

A: A lot of Jews went to Harbin.  It™s  some wh
ere near -- I don™t know exact
ly where it is. I saw it 
on the ma p, yeah. 
 

Q: Okay,right. 

 

A: But it was a large Russian colony. Then the --
 I think my grandmother opened a restaurant.  
They survived as well as they
 could.  But then, I think, th
e Japanese, you know there was 
trouble with the Japanese at that 
time.  So my mot her told them 
to come  t o France, asked them 
to come  and they did.  So they arrived just before I was born. 
 

Q: So your grandparents help
ed to take care of you? 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Did your mo ther leave 
the house for her practice? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: She was helping _____. 

 

A: In the house, yes.  My father was the only one. 

 

Q: Do you have any me mories of patients comi ng to the house? 
 
A: Oh, yes, oh yes.  Because the office was in the house. You know in a small village, everybody 
knows everybody.  I have me mories of going on 
rounds with my father and being impressed 
how special he was. You know people would lo
ok forward to him comi ng and they would 
always greet him by Monsieur Do
ctor and offer him coffee a nd schnapps. You know coffee and 
_______.  He joked with them.  He was a very pleasant guy. 
 

Q: Even in that continued du
ring the war, the relationships? 
 

A: This was also the war, yes. He was not allowe
d to practice because he was a foreigner.  So he 
practiced anyway but another doc
tor signed his papers for him. 
 

Q: No one suspected that he, you said he came from Roma nia? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And no one suspected that he mi ght be a Roma ni an Jew? 

 

A: And he spoke German. This was his ---.  Oh, I as
ked.   I have  kept in touc h with one fa mily in 
the village. The mother Francoise has known me  sin
ce I was six or so.  I™m very close to her.  
She™s sick.  So I asked her husband one time. 
You know how -- that it was surprising that 
nobody knew that we were Jews.  He  laughed an
d he said, what do you mean, nobody knew?   
Everybody knew.  So I asked him how come  nobody turn
ed us in.  He really struck me  when he 

said, we™re not animals, we don™t do that. 
 
Q: So I didn™t realize how very closely knit, --- 
the photos ---. Was it because, did your father 
probably and mother probably had foreign accents? 
 

A: Oh, yes.  Everybody had foreign accents.  Even 
me  when I was little because my first language 
was Russian. 
 

Q: We ll, I know that a lot of Jews were hidden by 
French who knew that they were Jewi sh. They 
__________. 
 

A: We  didn™t blame hi m.  

 

Q: You stood out. 

 

A: Ye s, oh yes. 

 

Q: Did you ever get the feeling or did your pa
rents tell you after the war when you had grown up 
that they lived in fear that they would be
 discovered?  That the Germans mi ght _____ . 
 

A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: What did they say? 

 

A: My father told a very strange story.  He said
 that one time, one ma n ca me  to him and said hey 
do you reme mber me ?  Apparently this was a 
man from J______ where my father was born and 
who knew him. My father was very frightened 
because he thought he had turned hi m in or 
blackma il or some thing. Then a few 
days later, this ma n was killed. 
 

Q: By -- in what circumstances? 

 

A: By a bomb or ---. 

 

Q: Oh.  I mean in a way it was ri
sky to live in an occupied town? 
 

A: It was very risky. 

 

Q: They didn™t have the freedom to go to some  other place ______. 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: They didn™t -- did you ever know why the decision 
wasn™t  made just to stay further south after 
they evacuated?   Did _________ 
 

A: Ye s.  I don™t know why they decided to stick it 
out.  My parents are very bold in ma ny ways.  I 
guess they _____.  Even though they must have worried
 a lot, they still ch
ose to hide in this 
fashion which was quite risky.  
 

Q: Your mother and your father ™s 
family, did they have siblings? 

 
A: My mother had no siblings.  She had cous
ins but she had no relati
onships with anybody. 
 

Q: So she didn™t communic a te with any of the people that ________? 

 

A: Right.  My father had --.  He has a brother 
whom I met once, who lives
 now in Munich and who 
was taken prisoner.  His mother 
came to visit right after I was bor
n and then died of cancer. He 
has -- my father, I believe -- has an older sister w
ho is in Israel and an older brother.  But I don™t 
know anything about them.  He never kept in to
uch with anybody.  Except his brother Otto who 
lives in Munich. When I  was 18, he came to 
visit. That was the only time  I saw him.  
 

Q: But you don™t know where Otto spent the war? 

 

A: He was in a camp, I don™t know. 

 

Q: ________. 

 

A: My grandfather ma y have been killed by the 
Germans.  He was a me rchant in J______ but I 
know nothing about him. What ki
nd of things he had or what. 
 

Q: So is there anything else
 you can think of, stories ______? 
 

A: I reme mber there was a --. Well we were home. 
We  all had a very bad time  be fore the end of 
the war.  But that was not because we were Jews
.  It was because some one killed a couple of 
Germans -- soldiers. We ha
d a little resistance.  
 
Q: Youdid? 
 

A: Ye s. And my father was part of it. 

 

Q: Oh, that™s  important.  Do
 you know anything about that? 
 

A: No.All I know is that the me n had a n agreement 
that they would -- if they were to be captured, 
they would all run away in the 
woods and resist.  So I think so
me  of the resistance ki lled two 
Germans and there was fighting at
 the end of the war. You know, the Germans were defeated 

then with treaty.  So that one morning, I 
was woken up by my grandmother who shook me  and 
said quick, quick, we have to run.  She grabbe
d me  by the hand and we went and hid in the 
outside with the chicken. The Ger mans had come
.  I don™t know -- I  have very few memories 
of it -- what I felt.  I don™t know if I knew that
 they had come  to ev
erybody or was only my 
fa mily, thought they had come  just for us.  But as we were running, my grandmother and I were 

hidden but the Germans saw us and they s
hot towa rds us but didn™t wound anybody.  My 
mother stayed in the house with 
the papers.  I think she was tryi
ng to hide papers.  My father 
and grandfather run away towards the woods to 
meet the other men.The Germans shot towards 
them too but mi ssed.  So that no one run away. 
They came back. The lady who lived in the 
house just stood there.  I reme mber she stood ther
e outside and she was screaming. After that 
they took us and they put us in front of the 
Marie and the wome n were -- they separated me n, 
women and children who were with a teacher. They
 were going to take us all to Germany in 
trucks.  But apparently the pr
iest  talked them out of it. 
 

Q: You don™t know -- that was in 1945? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: But it was before the war ended, close to liberation ______? 

 

A: Veryclose. 

 

Q: Would you say, a couple of weeks ______? 

 

A: I would say ma ybe less than that. 

 

Q: And you reme mber standing in front of the _______? 

 

A: Yeah,yeah. 

 

Q: And they had separated you into ___________? 

 

A: Ye s.  I reme mber seeing older kids cry so I cried too. 

 

Q: Naturally. 

 

A: I reme mber seeing Francoise walking by and sh
e was very pregnant.  
That was a frightening 
time.  But again it was not directly personal.  I have no recollection of anti-Semitism for 

instance. 
 
Q: Youdon™t? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Nothing?   Even any comments, I me an ____________? 

 

A: Sure there were, there wa s.  But I think I was too young.  Or either too young or I forgot, I don™t 
know. 
 

Q: We re people in the village, _______, were they 
aware of all the horrible things that were 
happening?   I mean, was there any percepti
on of the roundup of Jews in Paris?  Any 
deportations? 
 

A: I don™t reme mber anything, myself.  I don™t thin
k I knew anything in particular.  I ma y have 
overheard things and then tried to
 put them together in a child™
s way.  But personally I was not 
aware. Whe n I grew up I did not want to be.  It
 took me  -- it™s really -- it™s when my daughter 
was seventeen that she wanted 
to know about concentration camps, about what happened.  I 
told her I didn™t know, I didn™t want her to
 know.  She _______ need to know because she 
didn™t have to live through it.  
You know she was here inAmerica, she was fine.  But she didn™t 
believe me  -- I mean she wanted to know.  So
 she started reading books.  I started to have 
nightma res. Then I felt I didn™t want to leave he
r alone ma ybe with all this information.  Or I 
felt it was cowardly of my part not to learn wh
en she learned and she was quite young.  So then 

I started very cautiously to inform myself 
a little more.  By now, now I™ve caught up. 

 
Q: When was that? 

 

A: She™s 24 so ----. 

 

Q: We ll, ma ybe  when you talk to your father th
e next time you™re around him, you could ask him if 
he has any details ___________? 
 

A: We ll, it was a very small village. You know, so I think --. 

 

Q: But you were never aware of strangers passing th
rough there or anything, that they were helping 
or -- ________? 
 

A: I think theAmerican soldier, you know with th
e parachute -- I don™t know. 
 I think he died but 
I™m not sure.  I reme mbe r  there was talk about an
American soldier that was helped and hid.  I 

don™t know if he was that one or another one.  
Now who could have passed in my house, people 
came all the time because patients were there 
all the time  so I would not know who is who. 
 

Q: How did the -- did the peasants usually pay your 
father and mother in ki
nd or did they have 
cash? 
 

A: No, they -----. Yeah, I think they paid in m
oney, they paid in goods. Those who couldn™t pay, 
didn™t pay. 
 

Q: But they were able to make a living in this 
little village or did pe
ople come from a larger 
surrounding area? 
 

A: From the larger surroundings. The village 
and --.  Because there was one doctor in ______ 
which was seven kilome ters away. That™s the docto
r that signed the papers. And then -- that™s  

it.  I think there was just those 
two for quite a large amount of people.  Of course people didn™t 
have transportation, you know, in those days.They ha
d bicycles but cars were very rare.   So 
my father went on all rounds, he was gone most
 of the day seeing peopl
e.  He also spoke 
German so he spoke with the German
s. They also treated Germans. 
 

Q: Theydid? 

 

A: Oh,yeah. 

 

Q: How ma ny Germans we re 
actually occupying ______? 
 

A: They weren™t near us, of course, because of
 the house, you know.  Feels like there were Œ I 
couldn™t give you a number. 
 

Q: What did they actually do _______? 

 

A: All this what I™m telling you is the me mory 
of the child and never thought about so what I 
would say to you, they just satthere and were given things. They didn™t work. They didn™t 

work like the rest of the 
people.  I think they literally did pret
ty much just did that. They were 
occupying us and I™m sure living off the land. 

 
Q: Do you remember any of them as be ing mean or kind or ----? 

 

A: I reme mber playing with them, playing with some 
of them.  I have a feelin
g that they sort of --
were more or less I guess like the rest of us. 
We  didn™t have SS. I think we had young me n who 
mi ght have been just as unhappy to be in Fr
ance as we were unhappy to have them there. 
 

Q: So you didn™t get the sense that peop
le were particularly bitter about --? 
 

A: Oh, everybody hated the Boche, you know.  I think compared to the stories I hear of what 
happened in Paris where literally 
you saw people shot in the street 
or treated very inhuma nely, I 
think we hated the Boche because they were there, because they were the enemy.  But  I don™t 

think there were any inci
dents in our village. 
 

Q: No one died during the war _______? 

 

A: I think, the day they took us, I reme mber my
 father was walking around with the Red Cross on 
his arm.  He  took care of some body who was 
wounded, I know that.  But I don™t know anything 
else. 
 

Q: But you said that you were released 
pretty quickly all of a sudden ______? 
 

A: To me  it felt all of a sudden.  I don™t know what people knew.  I reme mbe r  my parents listening 
to the radio. You know, we covered all the window
s because there were lots of planes going by. 
Now not very far from us, there were bloc
khouse you know where they were sendingV- 2™s to 
England?   So they were trying to bomb those 
out, theAllies.  But in our village, ther e was 
nothing. 
 

Q: So you heard planes going over, ___________? 

 

A: Oh, yes. And shooting.  I don™t know exactly wh
ere.  Or maybe it was th
at one incident.  But 
for a very long time, if I heard gun shot, I would r
eally jump out of my sk
in but not any more.  
Eventually -- or planes in the night.  
 

Q: Do you remember anything about this ________ 
priest _?   So he lived in a house? 
 

A: Yeah, we had the church.And he was in the c
hurch, for all I know.  I tell you that™s where he 
lived, I don™t know. 
 

Q: So you were brought to him to be baptized? 

 

A: My parents say no. That he just gave us some  
papers.  I™m not sure I w
ould trust that.  I think I 
ma y well have been baptized. 
 

Q: We ll, you™ve got several coverage protection! 

 

A: I™m good either way. 

 

Q: Let™s see.   Is there anythi
ng else you want to say about __________? 

 
A: I am very grateful because since that time I™v
e heard so ma ny stories. Wh at happened to so 
ma ny peopl e that grew up that way. That ther
e was more than just the darkness because you 
have to be living it.  I need to 
keep a view of the world as not 
entirely dangerous or evil. The 
fact that we were saved, I thi
nk, to me ma kes a big difference. 
 I™m here.  But also not only 
because I survived physically bu
t I think because it allowed me 
to survive psychologically and 
to want to do the work I do. I™m ___________, to me
, it™s very important to help other people 
and to help them survive. 
 

Q: Are you Œ do you see survivors _______? 

 

A: No, I never have because  I see pe ople who have
 been trauma tized but in other ways.  I have 
tried to distance myself.  For a long time, I didn™
t ma rry a Jew, I never went to the synagogue.  I 
think I tried not to be a Jew because it was so 
dangerous to me .  Now I joined a group of hidden 

children and so that has made a big difference. 
 

Q: InWa shington? 

 

A: Yes.  It™s all overAmerica. 

 

Q: Ye s, I have talked to ______.  She was a Catholic nun and she _____. 

 

A: Ye s.  Once we lived in the suburbs I went to
 school.  I spent a year
 in London.  I was going to 
be an interpreter because I spoke Russian and I spoke some  English at the time. 
 

Q: I forgot to ask you what language you spoke in your house? 
 
A: I spoke Russian and French, mostly Russian.  French with my father. 

 

Q: Oh. That must have distinguished y
ou very muc h. We re you perfectly bilingual? 
 

A: Not in the beginning, afterwards, yes. The ki
ds used to call me  Russian Rabbit which I didn™t 
like. Then they would ma ke fun of me  saying 
I was a Russian rabbit. You know there is a kind 
of white rabbit with white eyes that™s called a Ru
ssian rabbit.  So they would call me  that and 
they would say I have white eyes. 
 

Q: Maybe they thought you were just Russian
 emigrants?  ________? . That wa s probably 
___________ 
 

A: Yes.  I remember in Paris I joined the -- it wa
sn™t in Paris, it was the suburbs so it was like a 
little town, like Bethesda.  I joined the Cub Sc
out, oop Œ Girl Scout.  My mother instructed me  
at this point to tell it was run 
by a priest, to tell him that I wa
s an Orthodox Russian.  He asked 
me  what do Orthodox Russian do?   I said I 
don™t know.  I was 12 years old and I went by 

myself.  I was 13.  So he got very angry at me
 and told me  not to lie. That it was evil. 
 

Q: Did you have a lot of conflict because you didn™
t really have a religi
ous identity or --? 
 

A: Ye s, very much, very much, yeah. Because then I ended up in the Girl 
Scout troop, a Protestant 
girl.  So I have never been able to identify with
 a religious gr oup because when I was a child. --- 

you know you have a child.  I don™t know
 whether you are Jewish or Œ 
 
Q: Well, I™m Œ I™m --. 

 

A: When I was a child, I liked the church a lo
t.  Perhaps the priest
 was good or perhaps the 
schoolteacher was religious and took us but it al
ways presented me .  I mean my two -- I was 
growing up with this guy with his big beard of
 course and sitting on the clouds and ____ was 
rather stern.  But then there was 
Jesus who loved little children a
nd took care of all of us. All 
we needed to do was to be good. That was simple enough and Jesus was very forging and 

understanding. There was theVi rgin Mary and it was a statue and she was so beautiful and she 

was wearing this blue cape and her hands were
 around, with such a sweet expression, that I was 
very attached to that aspect of the church.  I fe
lt safe.  I always felt I would go to Heaven.  I was 
pretty good little girl.  But one time , I think in
 front of my mot her, I 
crossed myself, she was 
furious.  Because, of course, I can™t understand he
r but it was difficult for me to accept what she 
stood for because it ma de no sense to me . I reme
mber sitting in the synagogue and there was -- 
we were sitting up on top -- because it was a conser
vative -- and so I was looking at the head of 
the me n.  I was looking at this 
rabbi who was short and had a b
eard and kept moving back and 
forth and kept talking and ta
lking and talking an
d talking and ________.Then the wome n in my 
days, were nothing. The wife of the rabbi was 
shaved. She had no hair. I knew she had no hair 
but she was wearing a wi g.  So I never saw what
 she looked like without
 her wig but it felt to 
me  like it was a terrible thing. The only othe
r person I ever knew who wa s shaved, her head 
was shaved, was the lady across the st reet who was a spinst er. She me t some  nice German 

soldier.  I didn™t know exactly what she did but
 obviously she had an affair with a German 
soldier. After the liberation, they 
shaved her like a billiard ball. 
 

Q: Did they shave much? 
 
A: They shaved her head. 

 

Q: Oh, oh, yes, of course. 

 

A: Because she had slept with a German. 

 

Q: And you reme mber that? 

 

A: Oh, yes.  It was a terr
ible story. You know everybody 
was saying _______ was her name , how 
awful what she did.  I was eight years old so 
you know, to me  it was --. 
 I just knew it was 
terrible because people said it was terrible.  She 
looked terrible with that thin hair. Then this, 
wife of the rabbi, also has no hair. 
 

Q: So you ma ke this connection?  That™s  
great.   So you were slightly confused? 
 

A: Yeah.  Because to me , it really didn™t mean ---. And then there wasYom Kippur and you had to 
be afraid because God ma y or
 ma y not grant you another ye
ar. You know, without much 
understanding of the Jewish religion, you have 
this 12 year old child, who wasn™t  given any 
explanation very much, comi ng from
 a religion that is much warmer and soft er; it seemed to me 
much more tolerant of children.  
In this religion, there was just 
this fierce God who didn™t seem 
to care, you know, who killed pe
ople right and left in the Bi
ble and was looking at me and 
saying ma ybe you™ll live another y
ear or not.  I never felt safe. 

 
Q: That™s  interesting.  Is there 
anything else that you want to 
tell?  You told me  about _______? 
 

A: I reme mber the store, Francoise had the stor
e and she was selling everything. You know, cloths, 
candy, buttons, ma rgarine, we had no butter, what
ever, she sold it in her store.  I reme mber 
looking and there was glass in front of ---.  She 
kept things behind the counter and then there 
was glass like that.  She had two children t
oo.  I would go to her house every day and I would 
look at the chocolate behind the glass with su
ch longing.  She said I would like to give you 
some  but I can™t  because everythi ng was ratione d.  So I was thinking of this chocol ate so near 

and so forbidden. 
 

Q: That would be a ----.
  So, in Paris ---. 
 

A: In Paris, so I went to church.  No, I did not 
go to church.  I wished I would go to church.  I was 
the only Jew in my class. All my friends went
 to church and then they had First Communion. 
 

Q: What kind of a school did you --? 

 

A: B.C. ??  You know it was First Communion or 
Second Communion and they had those beautiful 
dresses, all in white with veils.  
Oh God. And I wanted so much to be part of that. To have a 
dress like that, to be beautiful but, of
 course, I couldn™t.  I finished school. 
 

Q: Do you remember any anti-Semitism at that time _______? 

 

A: You know, I have a feeling that I wasn™t  about to
 deal with that --- I ha
ve no me mory.  It seems 
unreal that I have such a ---. 
 

Q: Did people know you we
re Jewish at _________? 
 

A: I think so, yeah.  Suddenly I didn™t go to church
.  Suddenly I couldn™t -- I never wanted to say I 
was an Orthodox.  I think my moth
er wanted me to -- maybe I di
dn™t talk about it but I didn™t 
have any religion to replace it.  I had no idea wh
at the Orthodox Russian did, I™d never been in 
on of those churches so it didn™t -- you know 
I couldn™t carry that. The girl scouts we re 
Protestant. I liked that too, it was 
nice.  I went to church with th
e Protestants.  If they went, I 
went.  By that time , it didn™t ma tter. When I fi
nished my bacc alaureate, I came  to London for a 
year, came back to France, moved out, lived in 
Paris till I was 23. Then I came toAme r ica for 
six weeks vacation.  But I didn™t go back.  I t
hought I would learn more English because my 
accent was terribl e then.  It™s st
ill sizeable now but then it wa
s rema rkable.  No one could 
understand me  pretty much.  So I stayed as an au pair with a fa mily in Cambridge, 

Massachusetts. Then I went to summer school in 
St anford to see the country and study. Then I 

decided I was going to be a psychologist becau
se in my fr ee time when I was living in 
Ca mbridge, I had the whole day free.  So I ma rche
d myself to Harvard and just sat and listened 
to the  courses and found my  
                                           (End of SideA)  

 I me t my husband.  I was about to go back to 
France and I me t hi m bec a us
e he was driving back 
to Boston.  He was going to school and I needed 
a ride.  So some body introduced us and we got 
ma rried.  It was six weeks later, he asked me  to 
ma rry hi m and I said yes.  So we got ma rried.  
Not really because we ha d two children. And we lasted ten years considering we were strangers 

in ma ny wa ys. 

 
Q: We ll De Long, that™s  a French name.  So he was French? 

 

A: No, he wasAmerican from Iowa. And his family came -- they were Huguenots that came  to 
Iowa very many years ago. So he was a little more
 French than me .  He ma y have had droplets 
of French blood. 
 

Q: You were both me mbers of persecuted religions? 

 

A: That™s right. 

 

Q: Theconnection. 

 

A: And we had two children whom we 
did not bring up in a religious way. 
 

Q: Where were you living? 

 

A: We  lived in Ca mbridge for six years. My husba
nd was going to Harvard and I went to B.U. and 
got a degree. Then we came over here. We  had 
t wo small children then.  He came to an age 
during theVi etnamWa r so he wouldn™t be drafte
d.Then we divorced in ™78.  I stayed for ma ny 
reasons. The ma in reason was not to separate th
e children from their fa
ther and not to break 
their life completely apart by st arting not only w
ith anot her father. We stayed close -- we 
always stayed close. With another father, 
a new country and a new language, I thought it™s bad 
enough for kids.  So we had an agreement who 
would stay around and we did. We  rema ined 
put until last year.  Last year, my ex-husband mo
ved toAtlanta.  I stayed around inWa shington.  
I started a private pr actic
e after I divorced which was not ---.As I grow older, I feel more and 
more Jewish.  My daughter consid
ers herself Jewish.   My son, not.  She™s working inTucson 
with Russian refugees. You know, the Jewish refugees.  She™s learned 
to speak Russian on her 
own.  My son --.  So she does pretty much the 
work of a social worker or a psychologist, a 
mother.  My son has studied industrial psychology. 
 He™s now working with a firm with -- in the 
area of handicapped but in a 
-- how big firms deal with handicapped people -- with sexual 
harassment.  I guess I am still struggling with 
where I belong but it seems like more and more I 
feel that I -- I feel a Jewish id
entity but not religion .I am less a
nd less a believer.  I don™t think I 
believe in God any more .  Unfortunately, I can™t
 believe in Christ any mo re which ma kes me  
sad but he wa s too much of a chil
dhood.  It™s  like a fairy 
tale now.  It™s  a ma n, not a boy but it™s  
a fairy tale and one day we have to give him up. 
 

Q: We ll, why -- what do you think _______? 

 

A: They were with Jewish.  I always had my Ch
ristma s tree.  Good question.  It™s  more internal. 
 

Q: Events happen in the Middle East interest you 
very much, for example?  What happens to the 
fate of ________? 
 

A: Oh, yes. To me , it feels -- it is heartbreaking.  
I have never been to Isra
el but it™s  heartbreaking 
that they are now killing. They were some ti me s killing children. There is a good deal of 

brutality -- that the people in 
the Middle East were -- lost th
eir land. Ye t, on the other hand, 
where are the Jews to go?  They need their country
. They need a place. We  need a place in case 
some thing happens, we need a home .  So how th
is is going to end, I don™t know but it™s ---.  I™m 

afraid it will end very badly for Israel.  I don™
t know, to me it feels lik
e it™s something that I 
cannot avoid.  It™s  where I was born, who I am.  
Maybe just wisdom that you™re better off just 
being more what you are rather than fighting it.  
As I get older. It™s  not a terrible source of 
comfort to me  unfortunately, but there are no ot
hers that I know, that would be any better. 
 
Q: Right. We ll, is there anything else?
