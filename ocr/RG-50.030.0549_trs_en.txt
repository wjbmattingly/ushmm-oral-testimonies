Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with
 
Sonja DuBois,
 conducted by 
Ina Navazelski s, 
on Novemb er 10
th
, 2008, in 
Washington, D.C., 
at the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum. First of all, 
thank you 
Sonja
 fo r agreeing to  talk with us today.  
Answer: My pleasure. 
Q: And as we do with all of our intervie
ws, we™re going to begin at the beginning. 
A: Right. 

Q: We™d like to hear Œ we™d like to lay 
the groundwo rk, and th
at means where you 
were born, when  you were born, your 
family, who was your family. So, short 
descriptions of your father and your mo th
er, if you had any siblings, their name s. 
And before we start with that, there™s some
thing I see that™s very unusual, with mo  
Œ from most of the interviews that we
™ve conducted, in that today you are 
Sonja 
DuBois
, and on the day you were born you were 
Clara van Tyne
(ph). That™s quite 
a different name. 

A: Isn™t it? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Right. 

Q: So, ex Œ 
A: And I™ve had a name in between.

Q: So, it™s all a Œ you know, here it is Œ 
A: All right. Yes, I was Œ 

Q: Explain it to us. 
A: Yes, I was born October 1994
 Œ ™90 Œ 1940, of course, in 
Rotterdam, The 
Netherlands
, or 
Holland
, wh ichever way you want to 
put that, to a young Jewish 
couple named
 Mo sh e
 and 
Sophie van Tyne
(ph). They  were Œ had been married in 
1939, and I was born in 1940, and their liv
es ended in 1942, and I was their only 
child. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: And Œ 
Q: Is 
van Tyne
(ph) a Œ a Dutch Jewish name? 
A: Yes, it™s a Œ 
Q: So you Œ 

A: Œ it™s a dut Œ Dutch Jewish name, but
 I never knew what my name was until 
quite a few Œ few years later. To get to the en  Œ to the initial part of the story, which 

will Œ you will want to Œ will want to come 
back to, is in 1938, a cousin got out of 
The Netherlands
 on the last ship, 
Hospel
(ph). Her name Œ her Œ her new husband 
and her, and her baby girl, went to 
Australia
, cause 
United Sta tes 
wasn™t accepting 
any mo re refugees. And th ese people figu
red back  into my  
life mu ch later.

Q: What are their names? 
A: Oh boy. 
Bev Schulster
(ph) is the daughter of Aunt
 Alice.
 Aunt
 Alice van 
Hilder
(ph). 
Q: 
Van Hild er
(ph). 
A: Yeah, 
g-e-l
, yeah. She and her young husband; he
 used to travel 
abroad, and kind 
of saw the handwriting on the wall. And he
 and his wife and little baby girl, and his 
parents came over. Who turned back up in life way later. 
Q: Okay, okay. So, when you were born in
 1940, where were you born Œ were you 
still with Œ yeah, of course you were with
 your mother, but were your parents in 
their own home? We
re they both Œ 
A: You know, I th Œ I think I might have 
been born right after their initial home was 
bombed. They lived in the old city in 
Rotterdam
 and I understand that was bomb ed 
early on by the Nazi. So, they either
 lived there or another place in 
Rotterdam
, and 
I know Œ I know that address. The 
initial address is, you 
know, no longer. 
Q: Did you ever see photos of them? 

A: I have one precious photo of them. And I didn™t get that until I was 60 years old. 

Q: Oh my. 
A: Which is a long time 
ago, too, you know. 
Q: No.

A: But I™ll tell you how it Œ 
Q: It™s a lo ng time Œ 

A: Yeah, it™s a long time to wonder what yo
ur mo ther looked like, what she smelled 
like, you know, the intimacy that
 you Œ that surely kids Œ 
Q: Yes. 

A: Œ I presume. 

Q: Yes. 
A: You know, all this I presume they de
velop with their mo ther, because I was 21 
months old when  they  were deported to
 Westerbork. 
And Œ 
Q: By th at time you were in hiding? That mo  Œ by that time you had been taken 

away from them, or they had Œ 
A: No, th e day they  got on the Œ 
on the train, on the transport to
 Westerbork,
 I was 
handed over, they hand
ed me over to a friend of thei
rs. And, you know, I will never 
know if Œ if this was a Œ of course it wa
s agonizing Œ if it was a decision that they  
had made prior to that, or if it was just 
because, as I heard it later, D addy™s friend 
said, you don™t want to take this child with
 you. I sort of thin
k of the earlier, you 
know, that they had agonized over it and de
cided that they  didn™t really know wh ere 
they were going yet in ™42, except, you 
know, you haven™t worked  in awhile, and 

they promised people jobs, too, so Œ

Q: Well, what Œ what Œ do you know wh
at he had been  doing, what his job had 
been? 
A: Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, after 
the war, I have a few precious papers, and one 
of these was his dismissal letter, w h ich wa
s typed in 1941, just a paragraph. An d it 

said that they were very 
sorry, due to circumstances, 
they had to let him go, but 
would recommend him to anyone. So wh en I Œ 
and he Œ he work ed in a Œ he chaired 
a linguist department like Œ it was an export comp any, so I guess he knew 
languages. 
Q: Oh, so it was an export company th
at had a department of Œ of Œ of many 
multilingual people. 
A: Probably, yeah, yeah. 
Q: And he was the head of that department. 

A: And so he, you know, he hadn™t worked  at 
Œ in awhile, and I trie
d to look up that 
comp any many years later when I si Œ finally
 started researching 
and found out they 
were a Jewish company too, and of cour
se, had been  bought fo r pennies on the 
dollar, or 
guilden
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Long time before that. So he Œ

Q: At 21 Œ at 21 months old,
 I would be very surprised to
 think that you™d have any 
memories of that time.  
A: No, I™m Œ 
Q: What are your earliest memories? 
A: It™s really strange. An earl Œ earliest me
mory that I have didn™t flash in Œ see, my 
life™s floating puzzle pieces, didn 't flash in
 until maybe a dozen years ago, when my 
husband and I were in 
Saint Thomas
 and they have these little boats that go 
between hotels and port. And ther
e was this Œ they look like little 
Thomas
 the train 
trains. And I said to 
Ron, 
I said, I™ve been on one of 
those before. And smells are 
always the strongest memo ry for me. And I 
smell that I™ve been 
on that boat before. 
Well, the person I was given to , after we went 
[indecipherable] 
and that was a 
temporary situation, when Mom came to 
pick me up, she tells me, she went one 
way, like my tram probably, and came 
back another way, which was across the 
Mass 
river, you know, not to be traced. An
d I remember sitting down on a little 
bench, smelling that smoke go over me, 
and oh, it™s so strange that, you know, 
things like that still happen. And put Œ 

Q: The little flashes. 
A: Yeah, they just Œ they ™re just little flashes.

Q: So, what happened to y Œ wh at happened
 to you before your earliest memories 
kick in, that you were told later, of your
 road? Your parents are there until they™re 
deported to
 Westerbork
. At the time of their depo
rtation, they hand you to 
somebody. 

A: Right, to Mr. 
Do lf Henkes,
 who became quite a well known artist in 
Europe
. 
And that™s an important connection, cause
 until like the 80s, I couldn™t figure out 

why I was given to one person and not to 
another. He was a friend of Daddy™s, and I 
did find out later that they
 were both artists. Daddy™s 
an art Œ was an artist.  
Q: Your father in Œ when you say 
daddy, you mean your birth father? 
A: Yeah, right. 
Q: Okay . 
A: There are Mother and 
Daddy, and Mo m and Pop. 
Q: Okay. That™s how th
ey™re distinguished. 
A: Right. 
Q: Okay . And Mom and Pop are 
the people who raised you? 
A: Right, right. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So, I was given to Mr. 
Henkes
, he was a single man, al
ways was, and had Œ took 
me home Œ well, first he took me to farm co
untry, wh ere a lot of kids were hidden, 

 
Interv iew with So nja DuBo is

but he found Œ the co nditions
 he™d found were atrocious
. It was behind a chicken 
coup, there was a family there. And I th
ink it was a mu tual decision, they didn™t 
want me, cause I cried a lot, you k
now, I would have given them away. 
Q: You™re a baby. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You™re a baby. 

A: I™m probably missing my  mommy . So he
 took me home, and then through the 
underground, nobody™ll ever know where, 
who, wh at, because I™ve tried to find out. 
Just within the last two ye
ars I was rejected to have them named as Righteous 
Gentiles, cause we couldn™t 
find Œ one of the reasons 
was we couldn™t find enough 
witnesses. 

Q: We can talk Œ 

A: Okay . 

Q: We can talk ab
out that later. 
A: Yeah, okay. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Fine. Enough witnesses. So he took 
me h ome, Mo m a n d  P op  are Œ  Mo m came to  
pick me up. And I think the reason my  
birthday was celebrated in August, nobody 
knew a thing about me, was that they got 
me in August, you 
know. I know when 

 
Interv iew with So nja DuBo is

Moth er and Daddy went to 
Westerbork
, that was like the 27
th
 or something, July. 
Figure they 
futzed
 aro u nd a little bit, finally found 
somebody. So in August, it was, 
you know, a new beginning fo r me. And th ey 
couldn™t have children, so you know, 
I was an answer to their prayers as well. 
Q: And where did Œ where were they Œ w
ho are Œ what are their names, and where 
were they from? 

A: They™re Œ were 
Elizabeth
 and wille Œ 
William van der Kaden
. 
Q: 
Van der Kagan
(ph)? 
A: 
Kaden. 
Q: 
Kaden
. 
A: Which is of the dike, in 
Holland. 

Q: Okay , 
van der Kaden. 
A: And they  had always lived in
 Scheidam
, which is a city right next to 
Rotterdam.
 And he Œ he was active, Pop was 
active in the underground, and Mom 
used to volunteer the Red Cross, so 
it™s Œ you know. I™m sure they had Œ 
Q: How old were they? Were they
 older than  your own parents? 
A: No, th ey were Œ Mom was born in the 
same year, 1913, ju
st like Mother and 
Daddy were, and Pop was maybe
 about five years older. 
Q: Okay .

12
A: So Œ but I didn™t look like an ybody, 
you know, when  Œ it™s amazing how many 
people Œ it really did take a village to br
ing up this child, beca
use they weren™t the 
only Œ you know, they took 
the biggest risk, but there was the pediatrician they 
found to examine me, who guessed at my
 age. Yeah, August sounds good, you 
know. Two years old, fine. You know, it™s 
two or three months. There was the food 
stamp office that gave me a s Œ a stamp so I could eat. 
Q: Eat. So you™d have food rations. 
A: Yeah, I had food rations. Let™s see, wh
at else? Oh, there were people that Mom 
knew Œ oh, one friend of theirs
 was a policeman, and from an old coat of his, I got 
this wonderful navy cape that she sewed.
 I must have look Œ you know, and it had a 
lining, I remember a p laid lining. So I 
mu st have, you know, wo rn . And the Œ the 
first picture I had was with a little knitted 
dress that was pulled Œ you know, it was 
warm. Nobody else had anything either. So, 
they pull that thing on and started over, 
and made this pretty dress for this little girl. 

Q: And you Œ you had no br
others and sisters in that fami ly, or did you? 
A: None. No, I had Œ you know, I was firs
t ch ild of my natural family and they 
never had ch ildren either. So, as Mom used
 to call me when 
she aged, and could 

remember my name, she™d say, oh, here 
comes my  only one. So , you know, we all Œ 
always meant a lot to each other.

Q: Then let™s go back  to your Œ your Œ yo
u™ve been Œ you e
nd up with them, and 
your earliest memories th
en, with them. Do you ha
 Œ can you pull those Œ 
A: Oh yes, yes, yes. As a matter o f fact
, I wrote a story about this, because it keeps 
flashing in front of my eyes. 
And that is the first time I 
saw a parade, or I thought I 
saw a parade. We u Œ we lived three differe
nt places during four
 years, by the way. 
Q: You were with th
em for four years? 
A: No, I was with them
 all my life, but Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ you know, communication was mu ch slower than it was Œ 

Q: That™s right. 
A: Œ so when people in one end of town st
arted making Œ posing questions that they 
couldn™t or wouldn™t answer, we™d just 
move across town. Well, you know, that 
doesn ™t ma ke any sense now, but it did then . 
Q: Of course, of course. 
A: So, th e second place we lived was on th e second floor, and in 
Holland
 you had 
these little spy windows at Œ at the front 
of the window, so you could see who was 
at the front door. Well, I was not Œ never 
ne Œ knew why, I was 
never allowed near 
the window anyhow. Strange 
rule, I thought, but Œ 
Q: You weren™t allowed, yeah. 

 
Interv iew with So nja DuBo is

A: Not allowed near the window. Well, wh
at do you do when  you™re
 told you™re not 
Œ told you™re not allowed? 
Q: Go to  the window. 
A: Well, you go to the window. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So, I don™t know how old I was, but I kn
ow it was at dusk. It was a rainy Œ it was 

that nasty rain they have in 
Holland
, just kind of slithers down and co Œ 
Q: Cold and clammy. 
A: Yeah. And there is a Œ a parade of men,
 and I could count, I could count to 10, I 
think. And there were five men across, a
nd then a row back, and I don™t know how 
many there were. And they were Œ there wa
s a drum in front of them, one drummer. 
And these people had strange costumes, to
 a child™s eye. They were all kind of 
brown and gray and black. But it wasn™t a 
happy parade. Just ki
nd of strange, but I 
thought it was a parade, because I had ne
ver seen a parade, probably. And some 
wore hats, and some that Œ 
I can remember the glistening
 of their hair, those that 
weren't Œ weren™t wearing hats
. They all had carried a roll 
of some sort, which later 
on I figured out were blankets. Where we 
lived, just around the block was a train 
station.  

Q: Oh. 

 
Interv iew with So nja DuBo is  
 
November 10, 2008 
 

 
 
15
A: And so, they were having their last wa
lk in their city, b
ecause you know, when 
they went to the train station and the door closed Œ 
Q: So these were not soldiers, th
ese were just ordinary people? 
A: These were Œ these were men that were
 found, they™re bei
ng deported. And of 
course, you know, I was being protected fro
m whatever nasty wa
s going on. I didn™t 
know it was nasty. I couldn™t figure it out. 
Why would you have a parade on a rainy 
day, why didn't they cancel it? I knew 
that much. And there wasn™t any happy 
mu sic. 

Q: And there was a drummer. That™s so strange. 

A: Yeah, it was just a Œ a single drummer. 
And then of course
, it was much later 
when I figured out that their fa
te was probably sealed when Œ 
Q: They were found. 

A: Œ they sealed the doors of the train. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: And Œ but, you know, Mo
m and Pop always, always wo
rk ed hard at protecting 
me from Œ from my other life. I Œ my life ki
nd of became a conspiracy of silence. 
There is good and th ere is bad in that, I™m afraid. 

Q: Did you play with other 
kids during the war years? 

 
Interv iew with So nja DuBo is

16
A: No, I belonged to Œ th
ey tried to make life as normal as possible for me. I 
reme mb er going to  a pre-school or ki
nderg arten, or something like that.  
Q: Did they look very different than you? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Your parents Œ I mean, your Œyour adopted parents? They  did? 

A: Oh yeah. Pop was red hair
ed, kind of bald already, 
and Mo m was a dark blonde. 
So Œ but there were questions all the time, 
and Œ and in  another 
group of people who 
Œ who could have Œ who became part of the 
Œ the extended family were the teachers 
and the parents that used to pick the kids
 up. Where™d this litt
le girl come from? 
How come, you know, she doesn ™t look like 
any of us? I have a 
picture, you know, 
class picture, of me. I was short, I was 
sitting on the bench in 
the front row, and 
there™s like a row behind me and a teach
er on each side. It™s one redhead, all 
towheads and me, you know, so 
you know, my hair is still bl
ack. And that had to be 
very telling, and it was years, year s, years later that my girlfriend
 Welly
(ph), who I 
still correspond with in
 Holland
, told me, we were all sw orn to silence. The reason 
was given that it would just hurt me. It w
ould, you know, upset 
me to know that I 
didn™t belong 
[indecipherable]
. Well, of course, kids have
 that instinct where they 
know that, or I did, anyhow. By th e time 
I was about five years old I figured out 
that Œ 

 
Interv iew with So nja DuBo is

17
Q: Something™s different. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: How™d you figure that out? 
A: Well, it™s hard to tell. There again, snippets. 
Q: Well, let™s have them, snippets. 

A: The most obvious was that
 towards the end of the wa
r, we used to Œ you know, 
people walk there all the time. I u sed
 to walk around th e city and meet 
acquaintances and friends. And 
I™d be standing here holding 
[indecipherable],
 and 
the conversation was always the same. 
Well, who have y
ou heard from, did 
anybody come back? When Œ 
when™s anybody co ming back
? That Œ and the answer 
was always negative, no, we don™t kn
ow. And I™m standing right there. So 
eventually I figure out, they™re talk
ing about Mother and Daddy. And Œ 

Q: Did you always know Œ 

A: Œ I felt Œ I felt Œ I felt Œ I think I fe
lt cheated, cause nobody ever told me 
anything. I was spoken about Œ it™s like, 
even when  I was older, but I was never 
spoken to . I wasn™t given the fact that 
I had an intelligence, that I had ears, you 

know, that I could hear. People don™t adop
t kids that way, not that I was ever 
adopted, but they don™t ha
ndle situations like that. 
Course, during the war they 
didn™t have mu ch choice.

Q: Yeah. Were you tol Œ do
 you reme mb er ever being 
Œ did you Œ when  you came 
to them, were they your mo ther and fath
er? Fo r all intents and purposes, you had no 
Œ no other mo ther and father, or did y
ou always know that you had another one, 
another set of parents?  
A: At that point where we™re
 putting things toge
ther, I knew. I wasn™t told until six 
years later. 

Q: So you were only told when
 you were like 11 years old. 
A: Almost 12, right. 

Q: Almo st 12. But at that point is when  
you started suspecting that you had a Œ there 
was something Œ 
A: M-More. 
Q: Mm-hm. Because of that conversation, always the same. 

A: Yeah. You know, I was Œ 

Q: Did you ask them, and they  
just deflected your answers? 
A: No, I didn™t Œ you know, 
I didn™t begin to ask until after to Œ they told me, 
because instinctively I think I knew it would 
hurt their feelings, or I wouldn™t be a 
good girl, and we were all trying 
to be very good
, and you know.

A: Œ it was kind of cowardly, I guess, you 
look at it now, but I was a little girl, you 
know? 
Q: Oh, it™s not cowardly at all, it™s nor
mal. And it™s also Œ wh at a Œ what we™v e 
found in Œ is that there™s a 
lot of people who had silences 
in their lives, in their early 
lives. And mo st of the reasons Œ and so me
times they don™t know those reasons, you 
can only kind of assume, but those who i-im
pose the silences, let™

Œ your Œ 
A: Mom and Pop. 

Q: Œ adopted parents Œ  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. Didn™t want to traumatize the ch
ild. They  Œ th ey Œ they  didn™t know Œ 
A: I think th ey didn™t know how to  begin. 

Q: That™s right. They didn™t 
know what to Œ how would th
ey handle this, and they 
didn't  know what effect it could have on you. Or Œ I mean, I™m assuming too. I 

don™t know.

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ you Œ well. Let™s talk a 
little bit how I was kept alive. 
Q: Yes, please. 
A: These Œ these people Œ you know, everybody in  
Holland
 was hungry, too. It was

Q: So how were you kept alive? 

A: There one Œ one day Œ one 
meal a day, a hot meal, was the meal of the day. I 
used to go Œ in 
Holland
 we have a lot of aunts and uncles, just everybody™s an aunt 
and uncle. They  found an aunt and uncle 
for me who gave me hot meal a day. 
Nobody asked where they got 
the food, or you know, that 
type of thing. But I went 
to these folks, my little cap
e on. And it must have been
 just a couple of blocks, 
cause I went by myself. And Œ 
Q: Why didn™t you eat at home?
 Didn™t they have the food? 
A: Well, they were getting to the s Œ goin
g to the soup kitche
n and getting this, you 
know, two slices of bread
 and this thin soup. 
Q: No, no, I™m Œ what I Œ 
where my curiosity comes fro
m is that you had a ration 
card; somebody had colluded 
and given you a ration card. 
A: Yeah, but that food was pretty yuk for a three year old.

A: Œ it wasn™t nourishing. Couldn™t get a
ny milk. I have another story ab out how I 
got milk. Bu t, you know, to get a regular, 
substantial meal, I was told I was a little 
waif already by the time I came to them
. Which is likely because I wasn™t getting 
enough to  eat, you know, at Mother and Œ and Daddy™s.  
Q: And so you went to this
 aunt and uncle who were 
probably not their relations 
either, but just Œ 
A: No, no, they weren™t. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And, you know, it was sort of shady, I™m

they got their food. 
And Œ but I had a nice, hot meal, and it was so sweet. I would co me home and I

come to me , and Œ and Pop would have the

somebody had warned us. Pop

were to go there as well. And it was 
a Œ mu st have been summer, because I 
reme mb er the cobbles Œ I had bare feet, a

were slick, but not ice co

something like that, and her Œ sh e said

ought. And she told

And it™s the black boots that frightened

 either Œ when 
you come in at a certain age, you don™t au tomatically become a citizen, you have to

Shifra

Q: Well, it sounds like that™s one of the th
ing Œ the real strong threads that has run 
through, is that you owe them gratitude. A
nd in the normal sense 
of, when a child is 
born, you don™t ask to be born. So, even

 then. Like, I didn't know who else died, 
and that all, you know, 
[indecipherable]
 open ed up. 
Q: So sh e fu Œ so sh e did some 
of the research into the family? 
A: Right. 
Q: Did she re-contact those maid
en aunts? Did she talk to Œ 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. And it™s mainly becau

visit?

A: You go home and you leave 
it on th e back burner again, cause you™re very  busy 
and you have children to brin
g up, and this was an episode
 that you don™t deal with, 
and I didn™t deal with it until 2000. I had a Œ 
Q: What happened th en ? 
A: I had a telephone call Œ thank God fo
r answ ering machines. We weren™t home, 

second time we weren™t home, third time 
was a charm. Telephone call said, my  
name is
 Bev,
 I think we may be cousin s. One 
of those tremors went through me 
again. And when we connected
, yes we are cousin s. She is the younger daughter of 
the family that left in ™
38. And of course she came 
over the following weekend and 
we sat up and talked , and Œ 
Q: And did they live in
 New Jersey
? 
A: They live in
 Israel.  
Q: They live in 
Israel? 
A: Right. 
Q: So how did you con Œ

A: So th e next year we went to
 Israel
, and it was so funny. I see 
Jocelyn, 
wh ose oh, 
that™s the one who™s been wearing my clothe
s. Because they used
 to Œ after the war, 
I got all these wonderful car
e packages, I was the best dressed kid in elementary 
school because th
ey used to send
 Jossy™s
(ph) outgrown, hardly  wo rn dresses to
 
Sonja
. And they used to hear, le
t™s put this in the box for
 Sonja
. Who™s 
Sonja
, you 
know. But Mom was keeping in
 touch with them, they we
re writing letters back and 
forth. So the package comes and I™m wear
ing these pretty clothes from my  cousin. 
Q: And you never knew  wh at Œ  
A: Right. 

Q: And you never knew . 
A: Never knew it until, you know, until 
Bev
 tells me all Œ all th
is stuff that™s going 
on. And that her grandfather 
van Helger
(ph) was our sponsor. And it™s Œ is it 
confusing? 
Q: Well, it™s perplexing.  
A: Okay , may Œ 
Q: It™s extraordinarily Œ 
no, no, no, not confusing as far as who was who Œ 
A: Who fits where.  
Q: But it is perplexing in its intensity. 
A: It™s a good job, and Œ

Q: To keeping this from you, in th e name 
of protecting you, and it certainly doesn™t 
sound like that. I mean, I can only imagine 
Œ I don™t Œ as I™ve mentioned before, our 
job is to kind of be
 neutral and let you 
[indecipherable]
 talk Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ and Œ and so, but the fee
ling that I get is if it had 
been me, I would have been 
livid to the sky that somebody Œ 

A: Good girls don™t get mad. They don™t 
slam doors, they don™
t say anything rude. 
They don™t even go to 
their rooms to sulk.  
Q: When  did Mo m and Pop die? 

A: Mom died last August two years ago. 
Q: So, very recently? 
A: Yes. And Pop died about 
seven years befo re that. And I brought her to an Œ a 
nursing home close to  where we
 lived so I could go see her. 
Q: Be with her. 
A: Yeah. Bu t it™s some thing we could never 
talk about, and she went to her grave 
thinking that I didn™t care about my  birt
h family, because by th e time 2000 - 2002 
came around, she wasn™t all that cognizant,
 so I didn™t have to answer for my 
actions.  

Q: But it™s all so Œ how could someone no
t know that that™s important to you?

A: I don™t know. M-May Œ you know, early 
psychology didn™t think that kids had Œ 
you know, when  I™ve been to
 th e Œ the hidden children c
onference, and we all say 
the same thing, we heard, 
oh, you were too young to kn
ow anything. So it didn™t 
happen? They didn™t believe in 
the subconscious at the time.  
Q: Well, it sounds Œ even if you don™t 
have memo ries of th
e time, you do have 
memories of feeling different. And of hear
ing these voi Œ these conversations, over-
overh earing them when  you™re walking down  
the street and they  say to you, or you 
hear the grownups talking, did they come 
back, no they didn™t 
come back. Or that 
you™re different at school. I mean, that™s
 conscious. That™s where questions could 
start arising, and a child would want to 
know, why are these quest Œ why is this 
situation there? 
A: Well, they were very  Œ they  were
 suppressed, yeah, very, very mu ch. 
Q: When  you Œ wh en 
you got that call from
 Bev,
 and she said I think we™re cousins, 
to me it sounds like these Œ you know, 
the past has broken
 thro ugh, finally. 
A: Right. And it™s amazing that she got 
my  telephone numb er, cause she got it from 
Mom. Now, Mom didn't know who was calli
ng, I don™t imagine, because that™s 
when the yarn started to unwind. We went to 
Israel
, and I spoke to
 
Aunt
 Alice
, her 
mother, who is the only person I™ve spok
en  to who knew Daddy as a person. 
Q: So what did she tell you about him? 

 
Interv iew with So nja DuBo is

61
A: Well, she used to tell me 
what they used to 
do, they used to 
go on bike trips 
together. And I Œ again, put a little piece of
 the puzzle together, rightly or wrongly, 
they used to go to 
Seders
 together at Grandpa
 Abe™s
. You know, they had th e 
common grandfather. And she said, we were 
so bored, we didn™t understand a word  
they were saying. Was a large family, we ki
ds used to sit on the end. Well, he was 
conducting it in Hebrew. He wo re a hat ove
r his yarmulke. That also is either 
Conservative Œ probably Conservative. So
, makes you wonder how far did the apple 
fall from th e tree? When Daddy picked
 Shifra
 as my  name, did he just like it, or did 
he know the Bible, the Old Testament? 
Did he attend Torah readings? You know, 

was he part of a minyan? All those things
 that I don™t think sh e would have known, 
but the Œ but all the other people that 
crossed my  path could have asked me 
questions that I didn™t know I had until I was too late.  

Q: It sounds like also, and fo rgiv e me, I don™
t want to put words in your mouth, but 
you had mentioned something ab
out this before, is that yo
u regain ed a part of who 
you are. You talked before about having di
fferent selves. Is that
 what happened  in 
2000? Is that some Œ 

A: Oh definitely. 
Q: Œ mo ral you have integrated?

A: I allowed integration. There™s not much 
of it. You know, every year or so I learn 
some Œ I come to the hidden children c
onferen ce, I might find another distant 
cousin. I did the last Œ two years ago. 
Q: You did? 
A: When we were in
 Detroit
, and
 Elise
(ph), our youngest daughter came Œ came 
with me, I asked her to  attend as a second 
generation. And sh e went to a worksh op 
and explained why she as there, and sh e sa
id, you know, this is Œ I™m the daughter 
of Œ and she mentioned my  name and the man in the corn er there jump ed out of a 

chair, ran up to her and said, oh, yeah, I ha
ve that name in my
 family, you know, a-
and so, you know, he™s anothe
r distant, distant cousin. But we see Œ we saw each 
other this weekend 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: I™ve come to the point in the interview 
where I ask, is there anything that we 
haven™t talked about that
 you think is important? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . 
A: I™m very intent on seeing that my gr
andchildren have a mu ch smoother Œ become 
knowledgeable about the Ho lo
caust through me, about th
e family, not necessarily 
the horrors of the Holocaust,
 in a much more gradual an
d open way. And Œ and I™ve

started that with my Œ our
 16 year old granddaughter. 
Emily 
is doing a school 
project where she™s using Œ 
Q: Your story. 
A: Œ my story as an example, and I™ve Œ 
Elise
(ph) has been very active in getting 
me involved in the school system where she 
is. And th e first time I spoke to class, 
where my eldest grandson is, those chills 
went through me again. And there I am 
speaking to children. The 
kid who shouldn™t be ther
e and his younger brother 
Seth 
is the one I really Œ it sudden ly happened. 
I used to go and take care of him while 
his mom worked. I™d see hi
m every now and again. A
nd even by th e time he was 
two years old, he was such a clinger. He ju
st loved his mo mmy  and he Œ she used to 
have to sn eak out the door fo
r me to take care of him. 
And I suddenly realized what 
Œ what a sacrifice that must have been. 
I didn™t get it until I was a g randparent. 
What a sacrifice that must ha
ve been to turn 
your ch ild and give
 Œ and give it life 
that way. Cause 
[indecipherable]
 to that extent, but Œ 
Q: But yes. 

A: Œ yeah , she tried to Œ 

Q: She took it.

A: Yeah, but she took 
it. I mean, that™s amazing. And 
so now, you know, I speak to 
schools not just to tell my story, but to sa
y that everybody can ta
ke a stand, and they 
need to take 
it for the good. 
Q: Did you talk Œ did you sh
are with your daughters, as 
you were going thro ugh the 
[indecipherable]
 steps? 
A: I had Mom and Pop tell them. They knew
 nothing until they were about 10 and 
13 years old, and I said to Mo m, givi
ng th em another opportunity to open up, 
actually, and it was pretty much the same wa
y, a very Œ a snippet Œ you know, well, 
we took care of your mo mmy , she™s our 
daughter, during the war Œ her parents 
didn™t come back from concentrati
on camp. That was about it. So when
 Elise
(ph) 
and I went to 
Detroit
 and we went to the Œ to  the 
Ho locaust mu seum at the end of 
the Œ the session, I went for a book. I said, 
I™m gonna Œ will you be
 all right if I got 
this for 
Riley
(ph)? And she was Œ her oldest 
son Œ and she was rightly very 
concerned, and said, you mean you™re gonn
a hand him a book and tell him about his 
heritage? I said, oh no, this is to help me 
ma ture him into it. An Œ and I™ve been  to 
the gift shop at the museum and I™m con
tinuing th at with Œ as the children grow 
older, so they can take pride in their Œ 
Q: Yes, of course. I™m Œ I™m speechless. 
Thank you. Thank you 
very much. I think 
you™ve had such a tough row to hoe, beca
use the shadows that you have were so

invisible. You know, wh en you talk thro
ugh the Ho locaust, you k
now that there™s a 
concen tration camp. You know that there™s 
a horro r. You know th at there™s Œ but all 
of these other things were invisibl
e, to try and pull away those veils. 
A: You know, in th Œ and th e Jewish co
mmu nity does not recognize that hidden 
children have this emotional invisible burde
n, that most of us are carrying for one 
reason or the other. If you don™t have a num
ber on your arm, you™re in a different 
classification. And I think that™s probably  
going to change as the older folk s, you 
know, pass away, it™s the hidden
 children that are going to
 carry on, and perhaps our 
children will carry on the tr
adition of Œ of teaching. 
Q: Well
 Shifra
, thank you very, very mu ch. 
A: Well, you™re welcome. You we
re easy to talk to, thank you. 
Q: Thank you, but not
 a very easy topic. 
A: No, no it isn™t, and it doesn™t get easi
er sometimes. S o metimes I don™t lose it, 
like today.
