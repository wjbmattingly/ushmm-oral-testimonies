Q: Okay . 
A: And then that helped us
 to be able to attend go
od school, to have all the 
necessary material for it. And we were ve

how the fami ly should lo Œ love and live 
together.

on my married  life la
ter. My ambition was 
to have a family unit like my  parents had. That was my  ambition. 
Q: It™s wonderful to 
have such a model.

A: Well, as the oldest boy, there was a 
Œ my father, as a matter of fact, last 
Christmas before the war, I 
still remember my father 
took me, put it on his knees, 
and maybe he had some premonition what
 was gonna happen. And he told me, 
Adam
, in case there™s a such a th
ing that I won™t be able to take care of my family, 
you™re the one that™s gonna take over, and 
it will be your responsibility to take care

show my  Œ my  classmates how well I could 
throw a rocks. And I did throw it at the 
tree. I wanted to hit the stem Œ trunk of this
 Œ of the pine tree. I mi ssed, but I didn™t 
miss the window that was behi

window, and everybody pointe
d Œ pointed to me, all the

About halfway there, the crank loosened
 up. The crank that the chain was Œ 
Q: Right.

now how it happened  that he es
cape, but he did escape from 
Russia
 and Œ 
Q: Did you Œ did he ever 
say where Œ where he was from,  was he born there, or 
something? 
A: No, or if he did, I don™t remember. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But I remember him as a very good, very, very honest, hard-working man. 

Q: Okay . And what other kind 
of news did you hear abou
t what was going on in the 
Soviet Unio n
? 
A: Not really much more, b
ecause they were very, very Œ not publicizing at that 
time, what was happening, and there was no 
contacts with any of the people. There 
were no contacts at all. As a matter of 
fact, my  mo ther and my  grandmother had 

very little contact with their 
own family in Œ in Œ in 
Russia
.

Q: Did people know about th
e famine that was in the 
Ukraine
? 
A: Where Œ at that time, I did not. Of c
ourse, I knew later, but at that time I didn™t 
know about it. Don™t Œ 
Q: This Œ yeah. One of the reasons I ask this 
is that Œ is just it™s, in today™s world, 
when we™re talking in 2015, 
it sounds almo st inconceivable, that with our means of 
information and communication, that we
 wouldn™t know what™s going on in a 
country that™s next to our own,
 because you find out so quickly. 
A: Well, Russians, who had a clamp on ev
erything, on Œ on Œ on wh atever was 
happening, the government had a clamp on 
it. The propaganda came right from the 
main Œ from 
Moscow
. There people are not allowed to
 listen to radio. Of Œ what 
they were reading in the papers was wr
itten by the government. There was no free 
speech, there was no free publicity of any 
that kind. So there was very little 
knowledge of wh at was happening coming out, out of 
Russia
. 
Q: Yeah. Were there different political parties in 
Nowogródek
? 
A: Oh yes, of course. That™s Œ Poles are kno
wn for it. There is Œ as a matter of fact, 
I remember saying that it-it Œ that if they 
Œ you have three Pole
s together, you have 
at least three different parties, political parties. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Poles are known for that. Ever
ybody is Œ has his own opinion.

Q: Did your parents have a particular bent
, or a particular political point of view 
within Poli
sh politics? 

A: I guess so. Well, to m Œ to us, whatever Marshall 
Pilsudski
 said, that was a Œ 
that was it. 

Q: Okay . 

A: It was a ru-ru-rule that has to be
 good, because he was a great man. 
Q: So he was the authority. 
A: He was the authority and to, he was Œ he
 died in ™35, and we cried. I remember 
we cried wh en he died. 

Q: When you said your fath
er served in his legion Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Is that correct? How did 
he Œ I want to get a sense of, was he close to him 

personally? 

A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No, he was Œ he was just his leader. 

Q: Okay . 
A: He was his leader. 
Q: Okay . So Œ 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

A: He Œ he Œ at Œ at one time, he was prac
tically a dictator. That™s how strong a rule 
he had over 
Poland
. But he was one of the good e 
Œ good dictators, which done 
very Œ done a lot of good th ings for 
Poland
 at that time. 
Q: In the late 30s, of course, as you say,
 th ere was talk of war. Do you remember 
what the summer of 1939 was 
like, what you were doing? 
A: Well, yes, the international situation wa
s very on the edge, ve
ry s Œ on the edge, 
as you Œ Germans were pressi
ng mo re and mo re for that 
territory, and threatening, 
and 
Poland
 had a problem, because for practically 150 years, 
Poland
 as a nation, as 
a country in 
Europe
 did not exist. It was not on th e map of 
Euro pe
. It was divided 
into three parts. Parts of 
Russia
, parts of 
Germany
, parts of 
Austria
. Those 
countries tr Œ took advantage of 
Poland™s 
production, they Œ they milked 
Poland 
to 
death, taking advantage of everything. So
, from 1920 to 1939, 
it wasn™t even 20 
years that 
Poland
 was a free country, taking care of
 its own. So  we didn™t Œ we 

were not prepared for any 
kind of war. We were Œ 
Poland 
was building schools, 
road, bridges, railroads. We were not pr
epared  for the war, and it Œ but war was on 
the Œ on the horizon. 

Q: That summer, did you Œ were you at 
home, were you on Œ in vacation, wh ere Œ 
what were you doing right 
before the war started?

A: Well, w-wer Œ we Œ it was just ove
r the summer holidays.
 S-Sc-S chool was 
started over in 1939, w-we just starte
d to school wh en the war started.  
Q: Were you in school when  it started?  
A: Well Œ 
Q: Do you remember
 where you were? 
A: Œ no, we were Œ we were at home. 
As a matter of fact, wa Œ was Œ what I 
remember distinctly, we had two beautif
ul German Shepherd
 dogs. They were 
young dogs, they™re guard dogs. And from 
the early morning, they were howling. 
They were howling, and we didn™t know 
what happened until we
 heard on the radio 
that 
Germany
 attacked 
Poland
. And that wa Œ so, very 
early in the mo rning on th e 
19 Œ 

Q: September first, yeah. 

A: Th-Th Œ oh Œ that was September, right? 

Q: Mm-hm, September first. 
A: First, that 
Germany
 attacked 
Poland
. Within the next day, my  father got his 
orders to report to th e town  of 
Zh e s t
(ph), where there was a big 
Polish
 army unit. 
Q: And where is 
Zh e s t
(ph)? 
A: 
Zh e s t
(ph) was the ep Œ west of Œ west of 
Nowogródek
. It divides Œ it™s right on 
the river, and it™s Œ it was like a fortress in
 the years past, and there was a thi Œ 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

45
that™s where my father was assigned to. He
 was reporting Œ had to  report to his unit 
over there. I reme mb er he li Œ leaving the 
town. We cried. I remember he went to 
his bedroom, and on the wall there was a picture of Ho ly 
Mary
, and he cried. 
Q: He cried. 
A: Because he had to leave his family. 
And I hold his Œ I was 
holding his hand, and 
I wa Œ cried with him. And he Œ we to
ok him to the bus, he took a bus to 
Zh e s t
(ph). 
Q: Hm. It™s interesting. What do 
you th ink the dogs were howling at? 
A: I don™t know how, they had a feeli
ng that some Œ some Œ something was 
happening. And I Œ it was scar
y. It was really scary. 
Q: What happened after that? 
A: Well, lotta Œ lotta young people were dr
afted right aw ay. They  had to report to 
his Œ to their military units. And within
 a few days, there was a Œ there were a 
couple instances where Ge
rman planes flew over 
No wog ródek
, but they Œ they 
didn™t drop a single bomb . 

Q: So, did you contin
ue going to school? 
A: Yes, we continued going to school. With
in about 10 days, my father came back. 
Let™s face it, my father was in his lates Œ 
late 40s. There were, 
in the unit that my 
father was assigned to, there were a lot 
of young officers that were very well 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

prepared. My father was an 
old man already, considered in those times. So he was 
put on a standby and came home, in the uniform, and Œ 
Q: That must have been a relief. 
A: Well, for us it was a Œ oh God, it was a 
real wonderful surprise
. But it didn™t last 
long because on the 17
th
 of September, Russians march into 
Poland
. Of course, we 
didn™t know at that time that they
 Œ what they had 
the agreement with 
Germany
, 
that as soon as 
Germany
 attacks 
Poland
 from the west, Russians will attack 
Poland
 from the east. Our forces were fighting 
as hard as they could to keep ra Œ 
Germans from marching far into 
Poland
, but eventually they 
did get all the way to 
Warsaw
, to capital. But in the meantime, R u ssi
ans took over the whole eastern part 
of 
Poland
. 
Q: So, if they attacked, or marched in on September 17
th
, they must have reached 
Nowogródek
 within an hour. 
A: They were second day. They were
 second day they  were in pol Œ in 
Nowogródek
. We couldn™t Œ we couldn™t underst
and some Belarussians and Jews 
were greeting them. They were gree
ting Russian soldiers marching into 
Nowogródek
, and they were Œ the orang Œ Russian army was pitiful. 
Q: What do you mean Œ wh at do Œ why do you say that? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
47
A: Neglected Œ neglected only Œ th e ones 
on the horses, the horses were Œ some of 
them were like skeletons. People were dirt
y in the Œ I could Œ it™s hard to explain. 
We had to c-compare what we
 were comparing to our sold
iers that were really, you 
know, sharp looking. This was misery. But th
ey were in power, so what can we do? 
And within a Œ one 
day of getting into 
No wog r ódek
, the terror s-st a rted. Russians, 
with the help of the local communist
s were arresting policemen, government 
people, any military, teachers, priests, they were arresting.  Pretty soon the local jail 
was full of our lo cal best Œ our local people. Of course Œ 
Q: Did you know anybody Œ 

A: Pardon? 
Q: Do you Œ do you kn
ow Œ did you pers Œ 
A: Most of Œ most of our friends™ fathers 
were in there. And of course, the second 
say, my father was arrested. And the I Œ 
they arrested him in
 town, but in the 
afternoon he came home. They Œ they qu
estioned him and released him, and I 
reme mb er hearing my parents whispering, talking. My  mo ther insisted that he 
leaves 
Nowogródek 
and goes over to the German si
de, to the town where he is 
from, where his family was, 
and my  father didn™t want to go because he wa Œ didn™t 
want to leave the family alone. Well, he Œ 
he Œ they didn™t have to make a decision, 

because that night we were already in bed,
 some of us, some of them were going to 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

bed. There was a Œ rifle butts
 against the doors, banging 
on th e doors. Local Jews Œ 
Jew, with a red band just 
[indecipherable]
 that he was a Œ one of the commissars 
that became communist commissar, led three or four, I don™t remember now, 
Russian soldiers with the rifl
es wi th bayonets. They took 
my father, they
 put the br 
Œ put him 
[indeciphera ble]
 and marched him, and that was the last time we seen 
him. 
Q: Really? 
A: We haven™t seen him since. For Œ for quite
 a while, it got to be
 known that if the 
jail would allow us to be Œ to give some f
ood parcel or clothes parcel to the people 
in jail, that meant that the 
person was still in jail. Afte
r about two or three weeks, 
they stopped taking parcels. That was indi
cation that my father was not in local jail 
any more. Where, or how, we don™t know
. We could never, during the war, after the 
war, we could never find out 
what happened  to him. 
Q: Did you know Œ 

A: And du Œ du Œ his main si
n was that he was active in a community life, that he 
fought at least Russians in 
1920. Russians and Germans pr
acticed the same th ing. If 
you eliminate leaders of the 
community, it™s going to  be that
 much easier to run the 
community. Well, that was my father™s pr
oblem. He was active of the Œ in his 
community life, so they had to get rid of him.

Q: Well, when they came into th
e house, did they give a reason? 
A: No, no. 
Q: No. 
A: They searched, of course, they
 searched the house, and Œ and Œ 
Q: You say there was a local Jewish person who Œ 
A: There was a local Jewish person that Œ 

Q: Did you know him, did you recognize him?  
A: I Œ I didn™t know him personally, my si
ster  insists that  she knew who he was. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And Œ and Œ but it turn out 
there were a lot of Jews in 
Poland
 that were 
communists, and there were some Œ there were some 
[in d ecipherable]
 people that 
were communists. And they, of course, right
 away worked for Ru
ssians, worked for 
communists.  

Q: Were there Œ was there a Polish communist party? 
A: There Œ not legal. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Before the war, all the communist party in 
Poland
 was not legal. 
Q: Were there any Œ any 
Poles who were members of this illegal party? 
A: Of course, of course, of course. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

Q: Okay . What a te
rror for your family. 
A: Oh God, it was terrible. On top of it,
 within a couple weeks of arresting my  
father, Russians authorities came,
 lived on the edge of the 
town Œ and like I said, we 
had a big house, we had a big barn , they 
wanted our property, because they wanted 
to Œ for Russian people to ta
ke to live in there. My mo
ther insisted that we will 
move if they give us a house to move in. 
And that™s why we did 
Œ we were not very 
surprised wh en on th e 10
th
 of February, 1940, again a Ru
ssian officer with a Œ some 
soldiers, at night Œ they always done all 
those arresting and depo
rting at night. They  
Œ it was the middle of the winter, cold, about 
a foot or so of snow. They marched to 
our house and to ld us to get 
ready, pick Œ get ready, pi
ck  up whatev er you can carry, 
because you™re getting deported. 
Q: Was this the same house, or had you moved? 

A: No, it™s the same h ouse. But we were 
Œ we were thought that we were being 
deported from our house to the other house.
 We were Œ we went Œ we didn™t know 
we were being deported to 
Russia
, to 
Siberia
. So it was quite a shock. 
Q: Oh my. Let™s talk a little bit about the mo
nths in between. Did you ever go to the 
prison where your father was, to bring food? 
A: My mother used to. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
51
A: My mother used to, at 
least few times a week. Sh Œ 
Q: Had you ever b
een to this place? 
A: Jail? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: No. 

Q: So you didn™t know
 what it looked like? 
A: No, no, I didn™t. I went by it. 
Q: Okay . 
A: You know, from the st
reet, I seen the entran
ce to it, was big Œ 
Q: Was it Œ was it a city jail, or something? 
A: It was a city jail, yes. 
Q: And how long was it that your fath
er was held there, you think? 
A: Well, we™re Œ as a matter of fact, we we
re pretty sure that, although they  were 
not taking parcels to him, th
at he was still there, beca
use there was my sister™s 
friend, my gir Œ her girlfriend, when she wa
sn™t a Œ she wasn™t deported, so she was 

there, and she, after the war, she told us
 that she saw my  father about a month Œ 
month or so after we were deported, he 
was being led to the railroad by Œ with a 
group of other prisoners, and she knew my  
father well. And, as a matter of fact, 
supposed ly my  father asked her, cause wh
en he spotted her, where are we? What 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
52
happened  to  his family. And of course sh
e said that she told him that we were 
already deported to 
Russia
. And that™s what happened. 
After the war she told us. 
That™s when 
she told us. 
Q: Let™s Œ let™s talk about this a little b
it more. You say you never found out what 
happened to your fath
er. That is, in Œ where Œ what 
his destiny was, where he was 
taken, or anything. Is that Œ that so? 
A: That™s correct, yes. We tried, through 
Red Cross, we Œ all kinds of institutions 
that had lists of Œ of our people that were murdered, in 
Ka tyn
 forest, in other areas. 
We Œ n-none of those lists 
have my father™s name.  

Q: So this Œ 
A: But then, of course, they were Œ lot 
of our people, lot of men and women were 
mu rdered in  the small town s and buried right 
there, close to it. 
An d so me ce me teries 
were never found out, never opened , never found out where, who was. 
Q: Yeah. And did you ever go back  to 
No wogró d ek
 after the war? 
A: I did not. My brother and my  sister did. As
 a matter of fact, they went to there, to 
our house, our Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ orig inal house. And peop
le were afraid. They  thought
 that they  were coming to 
take over, because there were people living there. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
53
Q: Yeah. What years did they go, or
 what year did they go there? 
A: Oh, th is mu st be about
 Œ at least 10 years ago. 
Q: So would be like 2005? 
A: Yeah, something like that, yeah. 
Q: Yeah, so would have been, oh man, 65 years after Œ 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Œ afterwards. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And in 2005 if they 
were there, then it was 
Belarus
. 
A: 
Belarus
, yes. They flew from 
Warsaw
 to 
Linz
, and then they  took a Œ I think a 
car, and drove to 
No wogródek
. 
Q: And was it feasible, or was it already,
 you know, no ho Œ no hope that there 
might be some information in th e municipal records about your father? 

A: Noth ing, nothing, nothing could be found. 
Q: They looked? Or they tried? 
A: They Œ they s Œ th ey tried, yes. Noth
ing could be found of 
wh at happened to  my  
father, which is so painful that we s
till don™t know what happened  to him. 
Q: About Œ did Œ was there ever any story ab
out, or any research done on any of the 
prisoners, or of the Œ the fact that they were
 held in this city 
jail for Œ you know, the 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
54
ja Œ as you said, the jails f
illed up so quickly after the 
Soviets marched in, and what 
happened  to  mo st of the people there. 

A: Well, si Œ you see, the Ru ssians, probabl
y some of the lists of
 people that they 
were arrested, and some of the people that 
they murdered, it j Œ 
it just happens that 

Belarussians do also have lists of people that
 they arrested. They
 were arrested in 
that territory. 

Q: Right. 
A: And th-they were Œ for so
me stupid reason, they will not release that list. So 
there is possibility that my fa
ther could be on that list, 
but th-th Œ the Œ the existing 
government of 
Belarus
 will not Œ not release that list. 
Q: Won™t Œ so that™s Œ that™s Œ yeah, I un
derstand. I understand. Before we go to 
that night where you thought
 you were being taken to 
your second home in Œ or 
another house, and it turned out not to be 
the case, tell me a little bit about those 
months in between, about October, Nove
mb er, Decemb er. How did life progress? 
What was going on with your mo
ther, your Œ your businesses? 
Q: Well, well, the business they took over 
right away. Within a week they took over 
the busin ess, and my  mo ther work ed fo r th
em. She had to work 
for them, and so it 
wasn™t our business any more. As far as the 
life, right away there were shortages of 
just about everything. Even 
the Œ such a thing as salt, 
y-you had to queue Œ line up 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
55
for hours sometime to  get some salt. Sugar 
was hardly ever in 
the stores. Meat. The 
only thing th at we could get pretty easy
 was bread, but otherwise, there were 
shortages of everything. 
Q: How do you explain that? 
A: Well, Russians were exportin
g Œ taking everything into  
Russia
. There were 
trains being loaded an
d taken into the deep 
Russia
. 
Q: And of course, supply lines were Œ were cut. 
A: Acor Œ of course. So Œ 
and of course the Œ the life was mi serable. Everybody Œ 
the fear Œ this is the way they run the 
country, fear. One person ag ainst the other. 
And they , right away  that Œ did that f
ear took over the whole town. People were 
afraid, they were li Œ would Œ before th
ey wo uld say anything, they would lo ok 
around if there was anybody listening. Becau
se all you had to do was say something 
about that you were not pleased what was 
happening, you can wind up in jail right 
away. 

Q: Did th is extend to  school, as well? 
A: Well, of course, the teachers were our ol
d teachers, but at least o n ce a week we 
would have to have special classes, where 
they would try to convince us of what a 
wonderful country, what a free country 
Russia 
is, how Œ how advanced, how Œ of 
course, we knew better, even 
though we were children. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

56
Q: So, what Œ what happened to  that
 gentleman, you said his name was 
Alex
, or 
Alexi
, who was work ing with you 
Œ wo rking fo r your father? 
A: Well, he Œ he left us. As soon as Russian
s came in, he left. He ma  Œ he was there 
maybe a couple days and he 
left. I don™t know wh at Œ wh at happened. Maybe he 
was afraid that they would 
put him in jail, too, because
 he escaped from there. But 
h-he left and ru Œ I don™t recall ever 
seeing him, or hearing of him again. 
Q: Okay. Now I™d like to Œ I™d
 like to broach  a subject that is a Œ a painful one, and 
a very sensitive one, but you Œ you mentione
d that it was a loca
l Jewish communist 
who came in when Œ when th
ey arrested your father, 
and took him away. Ho w Œ 
how did people Œ did people 
say, uh-huh, the Jews have
 betrayed us? Was that a 
sentiment? 
A: Exactly. That was the feeling. That wa
s Œ there were Œ I wouldn™t say they were 
all Œ all of them were communists, but th
ere was quite a few of them, and the ones 
that did it, right away  took Œ took over 
some th Œ importan
t position in local 
government. They Œ they 
Œ quite a few of them. 

Q: And Œ 

A: But not all of them. 
Q: Were there any people who, let™s say were Jewish and well-to-do, who were also 
arrested? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

57
A: Not Œ no Œ not that I know of. 
Q: I see. 

A: At that time, I di Œ did not Œ not that 
Œ not that I know of. C
ould be Œ could be Œ 
Q: Or deported, for example? 

A: Not at that time. L ater on I was told 
that they were, later on, just before 
Germany
 attacked 
Russia
, there were some  Russians 
Œ some jer Œ Jews were 
arrested and deported into the deep 
Russia
. 
Q: Before the war, how were relations Œ I 
mean, many Jewish people say that Poles 
are very anti-Semitic, or that 
anti-Semitism was rampant in 
Poland
. 
A: Well, a lot of it is true, a lot of it is tr
ue. But, at the same time, if you know th e 
real life in all the 
European countries, 
Poland
 was pretty free 
[indecipherable]
 as 
far as the religion is concerned. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So, whoever Œ whatever religion you we
re, you were free to practice it. Befo re, 
in the first Œ 30s, where Nazis took over 
Germ any
, they deported a lot of Jews to 
Poland
, or a lot of Jews came into 
Poland
 for escape from 
Germany
 to 
Poland
, 
and they  were doing pretty good. But you ha
ve to realize that most of the industry, 
most of the business in 
Poland
 was in Jews™ hands. Jew Œ Jews had a saying that 
was very popular, you have the streets, but
 we have the build ings on them. Which

meant that they Œ they
 were in control of quite a bit 
of industry, quite a bit of Œ bit 
of business. Now, there Œ they were known 
for being bankers, for Œ for doing lot of 
trading an d that. And sorry to say, but 
our average people don™t like rich, rich 
people. And they were Œ they represented 
the rich people. So lot of common people 
were, of course, hateful of them. Wa Œ bu
t we didn™t have any Œ with Russians were 
doing those pogroms and th at, we de Œ we 
didn™t have anything like that. But fact 
was, we didn™t like them, yes. 

Q: Were there any Jewish kids
 in your classes at school? 
A: Of course, of course. But there were so
me good Jews, and I have an example. I 
was going to  tell you that later. I will tell you later. 

Q: Okay, okay. I know th
at this is a very Œ 
A: Touchy

 subject. 
Q: Œ touchy Œ touchy sensi Œ it™s very sensitiv
e subject, but in Œ particularly in the 
areas of the 
kressi
(ph), where there were so many different occupations and 
occupations by Œ by different forces, armi
es and Œ and so on. 
It was one of the 
reasons why I was asking you 
too, wha-what was the make
-up of the towns, and the 
people, and so on.

A: Well, yes, like the Œ in 
Nowogródek 
there was a Œ quite a good sized population 
of Jews, but then there was also Belarussian
 
and th e Po les. It was pretty Œ I would 
say it was evenly  divided. 
Q: Okay . Well, we™ll break

 a photograph. Tell me who is 
in the photograph? 
A: They™re my family. My fa

other, my  older sister and 
me when I was one year old, practically one year old. 
Q: So that means it w as taken in 1928. 

A: ‚29. 
Q: Oh, 1929. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how is it that you came to have this photograph? 
A: My parents send it to our relatives in 
Poland
 at that time, and when we were 
visiting them after the war, we found it and th
ey made a copy of it, and they  Œ here 
it is. To me, it™s a relic. It™s
 Œ it™s something that I cheris
h, because that™s the only 
picture of our childhood with ou
r Œ babyhood, not just childhood. 
Q: Is it the only photo yo
u have of your father? 
A: No, I have some others. 

Q: You have some others.

Q: Okay. Thank you. Thank y
ou very mu ch , we can put it to the side now. Okay , 
before the break, we kind of stopped 
at the point where in February 10
th
, 1940, 
soldiers came to your home again and in th
e middle of the night, knocked on the 
door and told you y
ou are going to have to leave. 
Can you rememb er how lo ng you 
had to put your things together? 
A: They gave us about a half an hour, they  to
ld us that we have half an hour to  pack 
whatever we can carry. And of course, I 
was Œ we were bein
g deported from our 
house. And Œ now th is is the middle of th
e severe Polish kind of
 winter, about 25 
degrees belo w zero, but at least a foot 
of snow on the ground. And middle of the 
night, we Œ my  grandmother 
and my  brother and my  sist
er, were put on this sled, 
horse-drawn sled and my mother, my olde
r sister and me, we walked. We walked, 
and we were taken to the government build ing, not far from railroad station, and th e 

build ing was pretty soon bein
g filled up with a family li 
Œ just like ours. All the 
people from 
Nowogródek
, mo st of them women and children, because mo st of the 
men were either in jail, or Œ or gone somewh
ere. So, this is Œ this is the first day, 
first night of our experience, when they we
re being de Œ we were
 being deported to 
Russia
. 
Q: What did you manage to take with you? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
62
A: Well, most of we Œ what we tried, wa
s we took clothing, some clothes, because 
of the fact that it was so cold, winter, a
nd with that, there was hardly anything we 
could carry. There were a few things that we
re put on the sled, but otherwise we had 
to carry everything. So 
mo st of it we Œ we took 
with us was clothes. 
Q: Okay . I-In that government building, yo
u said there were families like your own. 
Did you recognize any of them? 

A: Of course, most of them were friends of
 our parents, and of 
us children. And so 
we knew just about Œ at least 90 percent of
 people, they  were either acquaintances, 
or friends of ours. 

Q: Then what happened? 
A: The next mo rning Œ the next mo rning th ey
 packed us Œ they to
ld us we have to 
march to the railroad station. When we go
t there, there was a whole line of freight 
cars that were prepared for transporting 
mass people. The way it was built, on each 
end of the Œ the freight car, there were sh
elves, two shelves on each end, wh ere they 
packed us, about 40 people to each car, wh
ich meant that we were to lay down like 
sardines, you know, one Œ you 
know, next to each other, 
on th e mi Œ in the middle 
of the Œ th-the wa Œ th e wagon, there was 
a coal Œ there was a cast iro n  stove, to 
provide heat. And th en on th e 
side there was a hole in the 
floor of the car, as a Œ to 
serve as a toilet.

Q: And that was it. 
A: And that was it. 

Q: Were there Œ was there anybody who didn
™t have Œ who didn
™t fit on those two 
platforms, who was in the middle of the car? 

A: No, they were Œ they were Œ they were just managed. 

Q: Okay . 

A: We just managed to be either sitting do wn , or laying down  
on those platforms. 
On this Œ on the top sides on each side ther
e were small windows, with the crates Œ 
with the crates so, you know, nobody could get out. 

Q: With grates, mm-h m. 
A: And the Œ of course, the whole train 
was surrounded by Russi
an soldiers with 
rifles, so there was no way to get in or get 
on of the train. We were totally captive. 
Q: Did an ybody at any point official, tell
 you why you had been  arrested, or where 
you were going? 

A: Not Œ not at all, not at all. Nothing, 
nothing th ere Œ there Œ they  wouldn™t ask us, 
they wouldn™t tell us, they
 were just giving us 
orders, do this, do that.  
Q: And the orders were, I take it, in Russian, yes? 

A: Of course, ti Œ only Russian. 
Q: Could Œ could you understa
nd what they  were saying? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

A: Well, most of it, but if not, my mother would translate it to us. 
Q: I see. 

A: There were a lot of people that did not understand Russian, but like I say, lucky 
there were a few people that would translate it. 
Q: Okay . 

A: There were no Polish, or Jewish, or Bela
russian civilians invo
lved in this. This 
was strict ly Russian soldiers that were guards. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And tha Œ and that was it. 

Q: Okay. Did that little Œ what place di
d you have? Di Œ were you in a bottom 
platform, or a top platform? 

A: No, we were on th e very top, on
 the Œ on the Œ on th e second level. 
Q: And were you able to see out a window, or Œ 

A: Yes, we Œ we would Œ we would, you know
, if we Œ if you were next to th e side 
of the Œ the wagon, or the car, then
 you could lock 
out Œ look out. 
Q: And was the win Œ did the 
window have glass, or not? 
A: Yes Œ 
Q: It did.

A: Œ it had glass. It was so cold, and w
ith some of the mois
ture in the air from 
breathing, all the metal parts eventu
ally were covered with a Œ ice. 
Q: Really? 
A: So that™s how
 cold it was. 
Q: So th at stove didn™t do mu ch  good. 
A: Well, if you were next to it, yes. So
 we Œ we had ev erything that we brought 
with us, we Œ were dressed in it. Later, 
when the doors were 
closed completely, it 
wi Œ it did warm up to the extent that 
we could take some of the clothes off. 
Q: Did you have any fo od with  you? 

A: We brought si Œ very little, ve
ry little, but we did bring some. 
Q: Were you fed on the train? 

A: On the train, once a day, sometime even
 twice they would br
ing a bucket of hot 
water, and a bucket of what they  called soup 
Œ that™s what they called it, it was a Œ 
loo-looked like a dishwasher water, and a lo
af Œ couple loaves of bread for the 40 
people. That was it. 

Q: Oh my . And Œ and th en, wh en  did the train start moving? 

A: Very next day. Very ne
xt day you started moving th
rough the Œ we
-went through 
the Œ 
Baranowice
, which was a big railroad center first. It was close to Russian

border. And then next day we cr
ossed the Œ the border between 
Russia
 and 
Poland
, 
all border. 
Q: How did you know when  you got to 
the border that you were crossing it? 
A: Well, we would Œ we would read the si
gns. We could read the signs only Œ also, 
we would see the miserable view of peopl
e. People were dressed in a shabby 
clothes, in a padded Œ women an d men in
 the same, with the padded  pants and 
coats, mi serable looking people, moving 
around like robots. And we Œ you could 
tell that it was not 
Poland
 any more. 
Q: Did Œ did you have a sense of wh
at your final destination would be? 

A: Well, by that time they did ha Œ it di
d come Œ I don™t know how it Œ it was told 
us that Œ we were told we™re being deported to 
Siberia
, but where 
Siberia
, we 
didn™t have the slightest idea. 

Q: Mm-hm. Did people get sick on the train journey? 

A: Well, not so much physically, but emo
tionally. There was a lot of crying. There 
was lot of Œ mo st of it was, I would sa
y crying and sobbing from all the mo thers 
that were there with all the small children. 
It was Œ the feeling was terrible, terrible. 
Q: Did you know th e other peop
le who were in your wagon? 
A: Ninety  percent of them we knew. 

Q: Okay , so in this wagon you weren™t 
Œ you weren™t with strangers, you were Œ 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

67
A: No, no, they were Œ they
 were Œ they were Œ most of them were at least 
acquaintances. Not frie
nds, but acquaintances. 
Q: Yeah. What kind Œ was ther
e any conversation going on? 
A: Oh, all the time, all the 
time. C o mparing notes, com Œ talking about parts of Œ 
people of the families that were
 not with us, like, you know 
[indecipherable]
 my  
father, that were arrested, and some othe
r men that were arrested. There were Œ 
there was a lot of talk about it,
 between the women, especially. 
Q: Were there any men on the 
Œ on the Œ in  your wagon? 
A: There might have been, out of 40, ther
e mu st have been about two men, maybe. 
Most of them were older men. 

Q: Mm-hm. So that does present a very sad picture. 
A: Very sad, very sad. 

Q: Did Œ did Œ so, but did everybody make 
it, that is, to the final destination? 
A: Well, everybody made it.
 Our Œ we were gone from 
Poland
, we were moving 
straight east for about a week. 

Q: Okay . 

A: You have to realize that we were not 
a priority, so the train sometime would stop 
for the longest time on the sidings, and th
en  we™d contin ue going. And even tually 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

we arrived in 
Moscow
. The reason we knew, because we could see the signs, 
Moscow
 on the Œ on Œ in the stati on. 
Q: Did you see anything of the city? 
A: No, absolutely not. 
Q: Through the Œ through 
the wi Œ little window? No? 
A: No, absolutely nothing. 
Especially it was winter, everything was covered in  
snow, and f-from that time on, from 
Moscow
 our destination changed. We were 
moving straight north. 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Before we were going east, 
now we were going straight north . 
Q: And how co
uld you tell? 
A: Well, we could tell by s
un, by Œ mo st of it sun, you
 know, that™s we Œ we 
changed the direction. And of course the 
Œ the Œ the country side that we wo uld see 
through those windows was ch
anging gradually too. There 
were more snow, more Œ 
it was getting colder, and there were more
 and more forests. And we traveled 
another two Œ after 
Mo sco w
, we traveled another two weeks, directly north. 
Q: Oh wow. So, it took a long time actually. 
A: Totally it took us three weeks on the train.
 By the time we got to  our destination, 
which we didn™t know it was our
 destination, but the Œ the name of the town  was

Vowogda
(ph), wh ich was a big railroad center. 
And up there we were told to get 
out of the train, and they  put us on a sl
ow horse-drawn sleds. And again, the grown-
ups and older children had to 
walk. Only the smaller and 
old were riding i-in the 
sled. And for three days we traveled to 
our final destination, staying at night, 
staying at the local schools. And few of them, we could see there was somebody 
spending nights up there before, mo st likel
y people just like us, the deportees, that 
they were spending night
s up there. And thi Œ 
Q: How wa Œ how was your moth
er holding out in all of this? 

A: My mo th er was a trooper. Sh e was so 
strong. She was so Œ how shall I put it? 
She Œ she could practically do miracles. 
She would, if she had the chance, she 
would warm up some water for us so we
 could drink s Œ warm water. She would 
divide pieces of bread into few pieces so
 every few hours we would have a few 
bites of bread. She was unbelievably strong. 

Q: Did Œ did Œ did she cry during the trip? 
A: Not that I seen here. She was Œ she wa 
Œ she wouldn™t allow herself to see us that 
she cried. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: She had to keep up
 the morale, so I never, never seen her cry. 
Q: So Œ and your brothers and Œ 
and your brother and sisters? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

A: Well, we™re Œ 
Q: All four of you 
were deported, yes? 
A: All four of us, oh my  Œ my  sister was 
Œ by this time she was practically 15. I was 
already 12, younger sister was 
10, and the brother was eight. 
Q: So your family was a little
 bit older, in the sense that
 there were no infants. 
A: No, th ere were no in fants, but on th e Œ in
 the train, in the car, there were some 
small babies, yes. 
Q: Yeah. And were you amongst thos
e who had to walk  beside the Œ 
A: Yes, yes Œ 
Q: Œ the sleigh? 
A: Œ yes. Each Œ every time, I was already 
12 years old, so I was considered that I 
could si Œ take it, take care of it. 
Q: And, were you thinking of wh
at your father had said before? 
A: Well, not at that time, but after that, 
when I grew up, many a 
times it came to my 
mind wh at Œ wh at he meant.  

Q: Because at that time it sounds like your
 mother was taking the burden s on her 
shoulders. 
A: She Œ totally, totally. She was 
in charge. She was in charge.

Q: When  you Œ wh en did yo
u Œ where did you end up be
ing your Œ what ended up 
being your final destination? 
A: Well, on the third day we arrived wh at
 Œ which was a logging camp. There were 
about five bar Œ wooden, log barra Œ barra
cks, designed for the people that would 
work f-falling timber Œ logging. And Œ 

Q: What was the name of this place? 

A: The Œ the name was 
Rzhavka
(ph), which took the name 
from th e small river that 
flow through it. The ri Œ the name of the river was 
Rzhavka
(ph), which means 
rusty. And the Œ the reason it was rusty Œ 
called rusty, because the water in it w as 
colored of Œ 
Q: Of rust? 
A: Œ rust, yes. From the vegetation that 
it flowed, the Œ most of the area were 
marshes, an d the Œ our camp was on the 
lower hill, among marshes, right in the 
middle of virgin forests. 
Q: That sounds very pretty, actually. 
A: It Œ it wasn Œ part of it was beautiful, 
not just pretty, it was beautiful. The nature 
can be that way, but it Œ they Œ also can be
 cruel, because of the cold, because of the 
terrain and whatever.  

Q: So your Œ the Œ the Œ se
ttlemen t that you go to is 
Rzhavka
(ph), yeah? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

72
A: Yes. 
Q: And they  Œ it™s ma de of Œ it™s comp rised of five log cabins? 

A: That™s right. 
Q: So it™s a rather small place Œ 
A: It™s not a cabin, it™s a big building. 

Q: Oh, big build ings, okay. 

A: Big build ing, well, I would say the lengt
h of my  Œ this, my  house, and there be 
anywhere 30 to 40 pe
ople in each building. 
Q: So it was like a barracks? 

A: It was a barrack, yes. And in Œ each si
de had a couple windows in it, and a big 
stove, and brick stove for heat, and for 
you Œ there was some
 cooking you could 
cook up there, but it was a big stove. 

Q: So di Œ were Œ was ever
ybody responsib le for their own fo od, their own co oking 
at this place? 
A: Well, there was Œ we didn™t have t Œ anything to cook, first of all. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So we were rely Œ we had to rely on 
what was in the camp. There was a bakery, 
and there was a, what they called restaura
nt, where, if you ha
d money, and you had 
a coupon, you could buy some soup, and of
 course, you could buy your allowance

of bread. Everybody, every pe
rson, child and old people
 were assigned 200 grams 
of bread, black bread, which amounted  some
time to a couple of slices. We were 
assigned that mu ch a day, and we could buy
 it. That Œ no more, no less, but that was 
what we could buy. 
Q: So, in  other word s, you weren™t given fo od. 

A: No, we had to buy it. 

Q: And in th e beginning, how did 
you buy it, if yo
u had no money? 
A: Well, we had some money with us. 

Q: I see. 

A: We brought some money because at that time in Œ in 
Nowogródek
, the Œ the 
currency already was Russian dru Œ ruble. 

Q: Okay, let me go back for that, I didn™t th
ink of this before. Your family had been 
well-to-do, and when  the Soviets took ove
r, then they nationali
zed and took away 
your businesses. But wer Œ were
 you given any comp en sation? 
A: No, no, I don™t know, but 
my  mo ther would get paid Œ 
Q: I see. 
A: Œ for her work. 
Q: And so that™s where she had the rubles from. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

74
A: Well, we also had Œ it turned out my
 mo th er has quite a bit of money. We, 
among other things we had a beau tiful hor
se. And the young man that worked  for 
us, and he still lived with us
 when Russians came 
in, told my mother that he heard, 
among men, that they were goin Œ the Russi
ans were going to  take our horse away. 
But he su ggested that he Œ he even had 
the person that was w
illing to buy our horse, 
somebody connected to the Ru
ssians, that he would buy 
our horse. And my  mo ther 
sold that horse, and she got quite a bit of money for it. 
Q: And she took that one you left. 
A: And sh Œ and it turned out, that
 was the money that saved us in 
Russia
. 
Q: That™s an interesting point. I wanted
 to Œ to get a sense of when  you had Œ 
A: Yes, we Œ 

Q: Œ wh en you took clothes and no 
food, then you were in a Œ in Œ 
A: Œ yeah , I Œ I Œ w-we never seen the money, my  mo ther never showed it to us. But 

I know that for a fact, that she sold the 
horse, and I didn™t know how mu ch she got. 
Of course, I got to know it later, when we were outside 
Russia
. 
Q: Mm-hm. So when you firs
t got there, she had a way of
 being ab le to buy fo od for 
you. 
A: Well, it was Œ you know, whatever was 
assigned to  us. And of
 course, she got Œ 
she was one of the first that she got a job.
 Her job was to bring water from the river, 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

75
that was farther on, not wer Œ next to ou
r camp, there was a ar
ea about a couple 
kilometers from there, wher
e there was a spri ng. And sh
e would bring clear water. 
Sh Œ what she would have to do is fill 
the wooden barrels, which were on this wood 
Œ on this horse-drawn sled. She would have 
to go to the Œ chop th
e ice, fill ti Œ with 
the bucket, walk up and fill up the barrels, 
and then take it to the bakery, take the 
water there. Again, dip the water out of th
e barrels and take it to the barrels inside 
the bakery . She would do th at all day l
ong. It wou Œ believe me, I helped her 
sometime, it was a back blake Œ breaking jo
b. And especially, she used to wear a 
sack in front of her as a apron. From sp lashing water and freezing, she sounded like 
she was a Œ she was ar mor, 
th-the Œ the ice so Œ 
Q: It would freeze, huh? 

A: Œ freeze, it would freeze. She Œ but she 
never gave up, she 
worked, because she 
had six mouths to feed. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Your grandmother too. 
A: Well, that™s right. Well, a
ll of us, were si-six of us. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So, she work
ed very hard. 
Q: Was your sister put to work ? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
76
A: When my sister turned 
16, I believe Œ anybody over th
e age of 16 had to wo rk. 
And lucky for Œ for her, she got a job in th
e local nursery, so she took care of little 
children. At least she didn™t have to wo rk 
in  Œ because the Œ all the other Œ and the 
other industry was logging. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And eventually my
 mo ther work ed there too. Wh at the de Œ wo men would do, 
when the men felled the trees, the women 
would chop the branches, and clear the 
snow so the Œ the horse-drawn drivers w
ould haul the logs up to main drag, and 

then big, huge sleds, pulled by the tractor
s, would dr-d raw Œ wo
uld draw those logs 
to the river, which ag ain in the spring woul
d be floated to the destination wh ate Œ 
whatever it was.  

Q: I want to go back to on
e point, just to make it clea
r, and it™s about the food. That 
is, you were able to buy food fo r yourselves
 if you had the money, but not as mu ch 
as you wanted to. 
A: Only  one bre Œ specially the bread, that was assigned to you. 
Q: So in other words, it was ra
tioned, but it wasn™t handed out. 
A: Exactly. 
Q: It was rationed in the sense that
 you could only get 
a certain portion. 
A: That™s right.

Q: And you had to pay for it. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Okay . And th at was with all food? 
A: Exactly. 
Q: Okay . 

A: The Œ the only thing is, all the time we 
were there, we never had any Œ even  the 
smallest amount of sugar. The 
Œ n-no butter, no meat. I nev Œ 
Q: So what did you have, what did you eat? 

A: Bread. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Moi Œ mainly bread. Some
time later, in Œ when we were already a couple years 
in 
Russia
, in there Œ well, maybe a year, they 
allowed f Œ us to receive parcels from 
Poland
. And sometime Œ my  grandmother, sometime some friends Œ as a matter of 
fact, we received a package of 
food from one of the Jews of 
Nowogródek
 that owed 
my  father some money. And he Œ he look
ed into it and found 
our address where we 
were at, and send us lifesavi
ng food that we™re Œ I™m still grateful for it. So, like I 
said before, there were Jews, and there were Jews.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Just like there are Poles and there are Poles. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

78
Q: Thank you fo r that. Thank you for sh
aring that. Oh, do you remember what it 
was that was in that package? 
A: I think it Œ mo st of it was pork belly
, wh ich is, to us, was Œ God, it was Œ 
Q: There™s a lot you can
 do with 
pork belly. 
A: Exactly. Especially
 when you™re starving, a little bit of fat Œ 
Q: That™s right. 

A: Œ is Œ it™s a treasure. 
Q: Yeah. So , did anyone get sick here? 
A: Lot of people. Within a, I would say six 
months of being in  that camp , we started 
losing so me infants, some babies. There 
was no Œ wo men didn™t have enough milk 
to feed the babies, there was no milk to be 
had. The babies were starving, they were 
dying. Pretty soon, about a kilometer behind
 our camp, on a little hill, started appear 
wood crosses. And after children, little ch
ildren, the older pe
ople started dying. 
Within a year, we must have lost oh, at
 least 50 people, older people. Our camp 
consisted of people from two different parts of 
Poland
. Half of us were from 
Nowogródek
, and half were from the southern  pa
rt of where Œ what was Œ what is 
now 
Ukrain e
, close to the 
Lwów
. So there were people from two Œ tw o different 
parts of 
Poland
. 
Q: In Œ how large was th
e camp, population-wise. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
79
A: It was about, I would say, close to 500 people. 
Q: Oh, that™s a lot. 

A: Quite a few. There were, as far as 
Russians, there was one man, commander Œ 
commandant, we called him commandant. And th ere was one 
KGB
 man, and one 
bakers with his family. And there was one 
Russian i-in th Œ a woman, which wer Œ 
she was in charge of the restaurant. 

Q: That™s an important position. 
A: Very important. The rest
 of it was Polish people. 
Q: And Œ how Œ what was th
eir manner towards you, how did they behave towards 
you? 
A: Well, of course, the Œ the commandant wasn™t bad man, but the Œ but the 
KGB
, 
he was typical commu nist. To him, the only thing th at mattered was his party, his 
nation, and he tried to convince us that 
we should be grateful 
that we wound up in 

Russia
. Within about six months, they op
en ed  a school, wi-with one teacher, 
Russian, of course. And everybody, all the ch
ildren, until 16 years, 
they had to go to 
school. And of course, we didn™t mind subjects like math and arc Œ physics, 

chemistry, or whatever. But of
 course they also tried to
 convince us again of the 
advantages of commu nist system, whic
h didn™t work with us at all. 
Q: So how did it Œ did children just 
stay silent when this sort of Œ 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
80
A: Well, we Œ we learn how to  go along with them. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Just to get a ga Œ got along th em. They
 Œ I Œ I was already twel Œ like I said, I 
was 12 years old, and what happened to 
me once, sometime we would sit on the 
bench, couple of our boys, and we sing ou
r Polish national songs. And they  through 
Œ we were trying to get our teacher mad. 
And one day he called 
me in and he told  
me if I keep it up, nothing may happen to 
me, but my  mo ther wi Œ may wind up in Œ 
in jail. So of course, we stopped doing that, too. 

Q: What kind of interac
tion was there with the 
KGB
 men? Like wh at Œ wh at was 
his Œ wh at was his function? Ho w did he Œ 
how did he Œ what was his role in your 
life? Did he come and just ta
lk to people, or did he Œ 
A: Well, he wanted Œ he wanted to 
make sure we were afraid of him. 
Q: So how did he ensure that? 

A: Well, his manner, first of all, his manne
r. He would march into
 to the room, told 
the kids, sit down. You know, his voice, 
his manner, and h-he wo uld really rough 
kind of a talk, let us know th at he wa
s in a cha Œ in charge, he was the boss. 
Q: Was there informing going on? 
A: Very Œ if there was, it must have be
en very little, because we were Œ pe-people 
were very, very well in touch with anot
her. If there was, I never heard of any. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
81
Q: Okay. So it wasn™t the same so rt of s
ituation as even back
 home, where people 
started being afraid of what th
ey  would say in  Œ in public. 
A: No, in  the camp Œ in the camp, wa-wa-wa Œ it was w-w-wa Œ solidarity was a 
main thing. 
Q: And, where did these offici
als live? How did they live? 

A: They had their own quarters. There was 
special barrack. In this special barrack 
they Œ th e baker has his couple rooms in th
ere, next to the bake
ry, and so the Œ the 
woman that™s in charge of restaurant, and the 
KGB
 and Œ and the commander was Œ 

they had th-their own Œ their own building. 

Q: And you said the commandant
 was not such  a bad guy. 
A: No, he Œ he Œ he was authority, but
 he didn™t over Œ didn™t abuse it. 
Q: Okay . 
A: He Œ maybe he felt sorry for us, of anything. 

Q: Okay . And so  it was mo stly what he didn™t do, rather than wh at he did. 
A: Exactly, exactly. 
Q: Mm-hm. So, you Œ it took half a year for y
ou to  be in school af
ter you arrived, so 
what did you do in that half year? 
A: Noth ing. Absolu te
ly nothing. Abso lutely nothing
. In the winter, there wasn™t 
much you could do really, beca
use eventually there were eith
er four or five feet of

snow sometime. And in the Œ you were so
metimes so cold that you couldn™t even  
breathe in the cold air, because it was Œ wh en you Œ if you didn™t have anything in 
front of your mouth, you c
ould feel like knives, okay, cutting into  your lu ngs. So 
you always had to have something 
in you Œ in front of your face. 
Q: And your mo ther would wo rk 
in this sort of situation? 

A: Yes, she did. Unless it got to be about 
Œ below 40 degrees, 
then nobody worked. 
But if it was warmer th an that, then ev
erybody had to go work , and men w-work ed 
falling trees, and wo men doing the rest of it. 

Q: Here™s a part I don™t understand. I un
derstand that she goes to a spring to  get 
water in the summertime, to haul it back up
, but in the winter there™s all this snow 
outside.  

A: Well, di Œ di Œ you had 
to sh ovel Œ you have to sh
ovel the snow wherever you 
could. So metime it was like a tunnel between 
the Œ on the each side there be about 
five feet of snow, and you just go. And 
the roads, with the passing of the sleds, 
eventually , you know, it was a 
track that you could go by. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And of course, the snow lasted abou
t Ma-May Œ May sometime, middle of May, 
before the snows would start to melt. 

Q: That™s a long time. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
83
A: That™s a long time. By June, it wer 
Œ snow was gone and th en summer right 
away would start.
 
Q: Would it be hot in su mmer?  
A: Well, I wouldn™t say hot, but it was 
nice and warm, and it™s Œ the beauty of 
nature up there at that time,
 everything explodes. Everyt
hing grows so fast, I never 
seen anything grow that fast in that humid
, warm air. And as a matter of fact, if it 
wasn™t for nature, I don™t know if we woul
d have survived. As 
soon as it got warm, 
some Œ a different kind of mu shrooms wo
uld appear in the forest. And children Œ 
and I was among th em, we would spend at leas
t half a day, every 
other day, picking 
mu shrooms. And later on, all kinds of 
berries: blackberries, 
raspberry Œ wild 
raspberries. And like I said before, if it wasn
™t for nature, I don™t know if we would 
have surv ived. The problem was, we could 
not preserve any of it for wintertime, so 
we had to  consume it right there. So
metime we would bring a bucketful of 
mu shrooms, cook it and eat it for next coup
le meals. And that was my  job, pick ing 
mu shrooms, picking berries. 
Q: Had you done that at home? 

A: Mush rooms, yes, and berries of course
, too. But I do Œ I done it for different 
reasons. 
Q: For pleasure. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
84
A: For pleasure. Here, it was to survive. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m. And  th at was th e su mmerti me.  

A: S u mmer Œ 
Q: So the Œ so there was no Œ like a fence around this settlement. You were allowed 
to go into Œ 

A: We were allowed, but there were hun
dred s and hundreds of kilometers of 
nothing but virgin fo rest. And we were not 
in touch with any Œ 
eight kilometer from 
our camp was the Œ what Russians call was 
baza
, which is like a center, gog Œ 
government™s center, where th
ey control all the activities 
in the neighborhood, for Œ 
where were Œ they just deci
ded where the loggi
ng would be. It wa
s all run by Œ by 
Russians, of course. And about 20 some kilo meters farther, there were a couple of 

Russian villages, which at time, w e were
 given permission Œ we were given th e 
pass, that we could go to those villages and 
trade, barter for some of the clothes that 
we brought with us from 
Poland
 fo r some food. 
Q: And did you? 

A: Oh yes, I would go with my  mo ther 
and carry a sack, maybe oh, 20 Œ 20 some 
pounds of flour, or some Œ some wa Œ wh
atever else we could. That helped, of 
course, sur Œ to survive. 

Q: But other than that, you didn™t ha
ve any contact with any local people. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
85
A: The Œ the only other person that I reme
mb er, there was a young woman. She was 
about 18 years old. She was a mail girl
, she used to bring our mail from the 
baza
 to 
our camp, and sh e would carry that, pass it on to every barrack. And she was a Œ a 
think when we got there,
 she was a hundred  percent communist. She would t Œ 
always tell how mu ch she hated us, and for 
all different reasons that she would give. 
But be Œ by the time we were leaving camp, she was our best friend. She would 
come and pray with us, as a matter of fact. 
Q: How did that happen? 
A: I don™t know how it happened, but she 
finally came to conclu
sion that we were 
the ones who were suffering, and we were
 the ones that were penalized for no 
reason at all. 

Q: And that was without you telling her so? 

A: Well, she became a Œ one of the friends. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And I Œ I Œ it was like a miracle. She 
ta Œ changed her feelings comp letely. Her 
name was 
Lisa
. 
Q: 
Lisa
. 
A: 
Lisa
. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
86
A: And we Œ just happened that in our 
camp was a nun. She was a sister of my 
father™s friend. And Russians didn™t know 
she was a nun. If she Œ if they did, mo st 
likely she would wind up in
 jail somewhere. But she would have classes, religion 
classes with us. Boys would stand guard arou
nd the barracks, in 
all corners, and she 
would talk to children, small 
children, about religion, about 
Christ
 and th at. And 
why we were watching, making su
re that nobody would spot us. 
Q: And nobody did? 
A: And nobody did. As a matter of fact
, she w as saved. She wa Œ she was Œ she 
went back  to 
Poland
, and sh e even Œ she was in charge of monastery later, in one of 
the Polish to wn s, and sh e visited my  gran
dmother wh en my  Œ my  grandmother went 
back to 
Poland
 from 
India
. 
Q: Oh my  goodness. Oh my  goodness. 
A: Yes. We called her sister wi Œ not so much sister, as 
ciocia
, wh ich means aunt. 
Q: What was her name? 
A: Sh Œ God. Last name was 
Petrowski
(ph). 
Q: 
Petrowski
(ph). 
A: 
Petrowski
(ph), but i Œ I don™t rememb er he
r Œ her monastery™s name. I don™t 
remember that. 
Q: It™s okay. So summertime w as a reprieve from the cold. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
87
A: Oh God, it was. But you have to reali
ze, our clothes, my first year, were in 
shreds. I Œ my  older sister and I had one pair of shoes Œ 

Q: Between you. 
A: Œ betw een us. W-Walking in the wood
s barefoot, is sometime even dangerous. 
My Œ my  whole everything, pants, jacket, 
everything was in shreds. We happened 
to receive a parcel from 
Poland
. I don™t remember who it was from, but whoever 
sent it, wrapped it in a piece of
 cloth. My grandmother says, 
Adam
, I™m going to 
make you a pair of pants from it. And 
she did. Sh e sewed it by hand, can you 
imagine that? And sh e made me a pair of
 pants. There was one problem with it. 

Q: What was that? 
A: On my seat, there was a permanent marke
r™s address. I Œ I had la Œ I had to  su-
sur-survive lot of ho Œ laughs Œ 
Q: Teasing. 

A: Œ lot of kidding from the other kids, 
because I had a address right on my  Œ 
Q: On your seat. 
A: Œ my butt. 

Q: Oh man, I just had another question a
bout this, and Œ let me think. Clothes Œ 
hygiene. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
88
A: Oh God, it was Œ there™s such a thing as
 Russian bath, where th
ey not only bathe, 
it™s a steam room, and next to it is the place 
where they put all thei
r clothes that they 
take off, and it™s so pr Œ it™s so hot up there, that it™s supposed  to kill all the lice Œ 
Q: Did it? 
A: Œ because, let™s face it, 
in the conditions that we we
re in, no soap, no soap, you 
just wash with water. The pi Œ oh Œ onl
y laundry you could do was in the water 
without any soap, an d lack of clothes bree
ds all kinds of filth, lice among th em. So 
my  mo ther had a routine. Every co uple da
ys we had to  strip, and we would look 
through our clothes, killing 
all whatever was moving. 
Q: Oh my. Oh my. 
A: It™s terri Œ yo-you don™t Œ people that
 didn™t go thro ugh it, don™t realize what a 
hell it is. 
Q: Not to be able to do something as
 si mple a s have some soap, and wash. 

A: Exactly, exactly. 
Q: And Œ but i Œ was this called a 
banya
(ph)? These Œ these Œ 
A: 
Banya
(ph), yes, yes. 
Q: Mm-hm, so it™s so mething like a sauna. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
89
A: Ec Œ exactly, exactly. And the Russians ar
e very proud of it. To th em, it™s a part 
of civilization. And they were sa
ying that, what kind of civilized 
Poland
 it was that 
they did eve Œ da Œ didn™t even ha
ve the lice Œ lice killing equipment. 
Q: Well, yeah. 
A: So we™re not civilized to them. 

Q: No lice, no equipment. 

A: No equipment. 
Q: I talked about Œ so we ta
lked about hyg Œ wh
at about, in the forest, were there 
ever any little animals? 
A: This was a part of it that still, you kn
ow, I still Œ when I re
member it, comes to 
my  mind. Normally you would expect to 
have some wolves, bears. There were 
none. There were totally none. The Œ the sm
allest Œ the animals that I seen were 
weasels. And of course, you 
couldn™t even  co me close to
, they were so fast. T h e 
only other thing th Œ as a kid,
 I would try to  do some fishing, and sometime with the 
success, which meant that we had a feast. 

Q: That evening, yeah. 

A: That evening, I would catch a catfish a
bout this size, and God, that was a feast. 
Q: That™s like about 18 in
ches, 20 inch long catfish. 
A: Yes, it was, yeah. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

Q: Yeah, even two feet. 
A: And I caught it few times. 

Q: And how Œ with out a fishing rod? 
A: Well, we would Œ we
 would take a sack 
[indeciphera ble]
 sack, put it on the 
sticks, make it like a n etting of it, and w-w 
Œ drag it around bushes
 or whatever in 
the water, and try to chase it. And sometim
e we were lucky enough that the fish 
would j Œ flow in to it. 

Q: Into the sack, okay. 
A: Into the sack, yes. 

Q: Were there ever official meetin gs that
 were held for the entire settlement, th at 
you had to go to , or anything? 

A: No, no, never Œ never had one. 

Q: Okay . 

A: But the Œ the Œ th e only time 
would be individual barracks Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ that will be a Œ you know, the Œ the Œ especially the 
KGB 
man . 
Q: So he would come in and hold
 a meeting for the whole barracks? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And what would he usually talk about? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
91
A: Well, about the success and Œ and li Œ of 
Soviet Unio n
, of communism, of the 
future is only with them, 
and all that kind of stuff. 
Q: Was there a radio in the camp? 
A: No. 
Q: Were there newspapers that were ever delivered? 

A: No, we-we Œ yes, but very few, becaus
e Russians would use the newspaper to st 
Œ to roll their cigarettes with. 
Q: Oh really. 
A: Yeah, that™s what they used. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So, but so metime we would get maybe, yo
u know, week old newspaper, or some 
Œ 
Q: How often would there be visits to th
e settlement from the outside? Like the post 
girl, would she come once a week, or Œ 
A: She would co Œ sh e would be 
about couple times a week, yes. 
Q: Couple of ti Œ was this about the onl
y co mmunication that there would be with 
somebody? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
92
A: Well, except the Œ some of th
e people worked 
in the Œ that 
baza 
place, they 
would be in touch with some
 Russians up there, but otherw
ise, there were very few 
Russians that would come to the camp. 
Q: So it Œ it really gets 
Œ it sounds like you were very
 remo te, and quite isolated. 
A: Totally Œ totally remote. 
Totally remote. And even to 
Œ the only place we could 
go without permission, which were 
Œ without the pass, was to the 
baza
. And farther 
on, to the villages, we would 
have to have a stri Œ slip 
of paper, pass, that we could 
go, and th -the signing when  we have to le
ave, and wh en  we have to come back . 
And Ru ssian people Œ excuse me, the olde
r people, when they
 made sure that 
nobody is listening, they  would made the si
gn of cross, and tell 
us how they believe 
in God, and how they feel sorry for us. 
But the young people, 
they were telling us 
that w-we deserve wherever we get in.  
Q: Really? 

A: The communists was Œ they were
 through and th rough communists. 
Q: Isn™t that interestin g, that an older 
generation saw thro ugh th
at, wasn™t convinced 
of it.  

A: Abso lutely. And ee Œ the Œ some of th
em even had th e holy pictures hidden 
somewhere. And when Œ agai
n, when nobody wa
s looking, they 
would show it to 
us.

Q: This would be wh en you would be goi
ng to trade, or something like that? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Would you like some water? 
A: Maybe a little while. 
Q: Let™s Œ let™s cut then, yeah. 
[break]
. Okay, so tell me, is th
ere anything else that 
I haven™t asked about, about life in the settle
ment, life in the camp, that you think is 
important for people to know about? 
A: Well, yo Œ in this situation 
[indecipherable]
 that it™s really gets to you, the 
helplessness, and the Œ it gets to not just gr
own-ups, but also to ch
ildren, that we are 
dependent on th at one guy 
up there in th Œ that 
KGB
 man, whoever, that we don™t 
count, whatever we think, 
whatever we feel doesn™t count, it™s Œ we are helpless, 
totally helpless and hopeless. And eventua
lly brings in depression, and so metime, 
you know, it affects people di
fferent way. Some bec Œ become where they pick 
fights, aggressive. Some were totally cu
t off from the rest of the population. 
Q: They retreat in themselves. 

A: They 
[indecipherable]
 themselves. And it™s a very sa
d situation, very sad. And 
the hunger is a terp Œ terrible feeling. It™s 
Œ it gets to you to the extent that you think 
of eating, you dream of eating, your ho  Œ your whole concentration is on getting 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

some food. And believe me, in all Œ mo st of 
that time we were there, that™s what our 
main interest, and ma Œ our Œ our main 
effort was, to get some to eat.  
Q: So people changed? 
A: Oh, totally, totally, totally
, totally. And the family beco
mes unit, and if you work  
together, you su rviv e. If you don™t, you d
on™t have mu ch choice but give up. A lo t 
of people did give up,
 and pretty soon, there were 
the Œ the crosses on that hill 
multiply again. 

Q: So were there people who were deport
ed without their families, fo r example. 
A: There were a few, yes, there were a few people. 
Q: And th Œ so if you were 
alone, you had far less chance. 
A: Exactly. Because family held together, helped to stay 
Œ you know, had your 
mind set out to s Œ on su rviv al. 

Q: So you went thro ugh th e 
winter of 1940, the summer of 1940 and the winter of 
1941. And, was that second winter
 pretty similar to the first? 
A: Well, winter itself was similar, but as 
far as we were conc
erned, we were in 
much worse shape, physically. 

Q: Okay, ec Œ describe it. 
A: Mainly Œ 
Q: Yeah.

A: Œ mainly physically. We were Œ we were starving, you know, eating just bread, 
and very little of it, doesn™t bi-build up 
any strength, any Œ you Œ you are hungry 
most of the time. 
Q: So you were weaker with Œ 
A: You were weaker Œ weaker physically
, and sometime, like I said before, people 
got to the point where 
they were giving up. 
Q: So did th ey
 commit suicide? 
A: No. 

Q: They just died. 

A: They didn™t have to, they
 didn™t have to, they just
 laid down and died. And it 
happened , a lot of people happen
ed, and Œ to a lot of people. 
Q: Were there any other transports that came after you? 

A: No, no. No mo re people. 
We™re di Œ we™re Œ a Œ eventually, we know now that 
there were other transports, but at that tim
e, at our place, we didn™t have a idea. 
Q: Okay , you would have
 been the only ones. 
A: We were Œ we were getting some mail fro m 
Poland
, but when ever people tried 
to tell us something, it was cut out by censo
rship. We would get the letters with the 
parts of it cut out. 

Q: I see. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

A: Yes. 
Q: I see. So the second winter wa
s a lot harder than the first one? 
A: Positively, positively, positively. Our 
clothes were already in shreds, and we 
were very, very bad shape 
physically. Wit Œ what™s happened , second su mmer, the 
authorities told us that we 
can try to have a gardens. 
Q: Oh, you were allo
wed to have ga Œ 
A: We were allowed to Œ to have a garden
s. So we Œ they  divided some of the open 
area in the camp into plots, and it Œ we drew  lots, and it just happ
ened that we Œ our 
part Œ our lot was very far in the Œ practic
ally in the woods. Wh
at turned out that 
nobody drew a lot which was right in front
 of our barrack. So 
my  mo th er wen t  to  
the Œ the ca Œ ca Œ our commander, and ask hi
m if she could cha Œ trade the Œ the Œ 
and she did. So we had a Œ about, I woul
d say 50 by 50 feet pl
ot of land that we 
could Œ we could Œ 

Q: Plant. 
A: Œ plan t. It just happened, this is a st
ory in itself. Second su mmer, my  mo ther and 
I, we went to the village, which is located 
about 28 kilometers, to
 trade, I think it 
was my father™s jacket or something, fo
r some 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes. The 
problem was that we™d had no means of br
inging those potatoes to the camp. So we 
told the Russians people to k
eep it for us, and we will come
 back for it in the winter. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

It just again happened that
 my mother was sick. She 
lifted something heavy while 
she was working in the woods, and hurt he
r back, she couldn™t get up. She was in 
bed. And th Œ we were really starving. 
We had a family get 
togeth er, and decided 
that we have t Œ my  brother, who was that 
time just eig h t years old Œ no, I™m sorry, 
he was practically nine already. No, he 
was eight years old. And I was practically 
13 Œ no, I was 13 years old. So, th at were 
two of us, right in the middle of winter, 
we have to  go and get those potatoes. Twen
ty-eight kilometers in the winter, 30 
below zero. 
Q: Oh my  gosh. 

A: I, previous summer, I work Œ I made a 
sled , I built a s Œ myself a sled. We were 
gonna use that sled to bring those potatoes.
 So , my  mo ther gave me and my  brother 
slice of bread. That had to last us two 
days. And early in the mo rning we marched 
with dragging th at sled. We went to, a 13 a
nd a eight, practically 
nine year old boys, 
28 kilometers to bring the 60 
or 80 pounds of potatoes. 
Q: Potatoes. And you did? 

A: We walked all day. When I close my ey
es now, I still see when
 we got out of the 
woods, there was a small hill, and on top of
 the hill there were some hats Œ hats, 
with the chimneys, and the smoke coming 
from the chi Œ it looked like picture from 
heaven , after walking all day. I found the 
hats, with my  Œ wh ere the potatoes were. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
98
We got in hat Œ the room was full of people.
 T u rn ed  ou t th
ere were people that were 
going, men mostly, that were going to go 
to our camp with ho
rses and Œ to help 
working in the woods,
 in the logging. I still rememb
er th e smell of the sweat, 
bodies, and the cigars, or smo Œ I mean, 
s Œ pipes and smoking. We slept all on the 
grou Œ on the floor. Woke up in  next 
mo rning about five, six o™clock in the 
morning. I went outside. Turn
ed out during the night, about 
12 inches of snow fell.  
Q: Oh my  goodness. You were saved. You 
were saved, cause it 
could have fallen on 
you. 

A: But this was Œ going thro
ugh the virgin  forest was ju
st a, you know, path cu t out 
through the Œ through th e wo ods. I hadthe idea. I started going to  every man, 
asking if they will allow us to tie our sl
ed to their horse Œ 
horse drawn sled, you 
know, to help us. 
Q: Right. 

A: None of them would allow it. 
Q: Really? 
A: Finally, there was a woman with  a young 
girl, most likely my age. And I ask her. 
First she refuse, and then she change her mind. Sh e says, all right, you can do it on 
one co ndition, that you lead my  horse. Of 
course, I agreed to it.
 So we put our bag 
of potatoes on the sled, covered it with th
e blanket and some straw. My son Œ my  

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

brother would sit on it, and the Œ the sled wa
s full of about five feet high with hay 
for the horses that would be
 fed on the Œ in  our camp. And th e two women climbed 
on th e top of that sled hay, 
and I would lead it. We were
 about the last ones of the 
whole caravan of those sleds. E-Everyt
hing was fine, until we
 got to about the 
middle of the distance to our camp. Ther
e was a steep hill, downwards went the 
road, and on the bottom there 
was a stream, which of cour
se was fr ozen solid now. 
And there the pass Œ the road turned left. 
Well, we were coming down th-the sleds 
that went ahead of us, cleaned the road pr
etty well, so when we were coming, it was 
pretty slick going. I kept holding th e horse 
as mu ch as I could, but the Œ gradually 
horse start to galloping, faster and faster. 
Finally I couldn™t keep 
up with him, so I 
let go. The sled with the Œ went all the wa
y down to the hill, a
nd made the turn. As 
it made the turn to the left
, it slid sideways, hit the 
embankment of snow, and the 
two wo men were catapult out of the top of th
e sled, into the big 
pile of snow. All I 
could see is two pair of legs sticking out.
 Of course, my  brother turn  over too. 
Q: What happened to  the potatoes? 

A: Well, they were Œ they we
re turned over too, 
into  the snow. It took us about half 
an hour to straighten out the sled, a
nd put back the potato
es on Œ on th e sled 
[indecipherable]
 with my little sled, my brother on
 it. By the end of the day, we 
were at our camp.

Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: Next day I was walking, and I seen th
at woman splitting logs for her fireplace. 
She wasn ™t much good at it, but I was. For 
next hour or so I split all the wood that 
she had. That was my  thank you to her fo
r being so  good and 
help us, because I 
don™t know how we would have made it back that night, to the camp. So  she was 

good to me, and I repaid it by Œ 

Q: Splitting her logs. 
A: Œ splitting her woods for her. 
Q: Amazing. 

A: Amazing. 
Q: Amazing. 
A: And when I think about it now, my 
brother wasn™t even nine years old. 

Q: And the potatoes, did they help? 

A: Oh, God. Wa Œ there were Œ there were
 Œ that Œ I don™t reme mb er how long ago 
we went to sleep with our 
bellies full. The potatoes tasted
 better than any before and 
any time after, when th ey did. And for next
 month or so, and wh en Œ when  we got 
the plot of land, wh en  my  mo ther would 
peel the potatoes, her Œ she Œ wh en there 
was a eye, with the possibility of growing, 
she would make a big, deep cut and save

it. So we planted those pieces, and next
 year we had a Œ so
me Œ our own fresh 
potatoes growing. 
Q: Wow. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Wow. 

A: That was part of the good story. 

Q: It is. It is, but what a difficult Œ what
 a difficult thing to do. And for little boys, I 
mean, as you were starting to tell this, I wa
s thinking, my  goodness, those potatoes 
will freeze on that Œ on that journey. 

A: Well, it was like I said, we covered with 
Œ with the straw, with the blanket, and 
my brother was sitting on Œ 

Q: Sitting on top of it, like a chicken on some eggs. 

A: Exactly, yes. 

Q: So, by this time, let™s say, the second 
winter goes by, and that™s the winter of 
1941, and then the summer is
 when you plant, or Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ yes, you plant those Œ 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Now, in June 1941 is when 
Germany
 attacked the 
Soviet Union
. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
102
A: Yes. 
Q: Did your lives change after that? 

A: Well, the irony of it, that we, that year
 we got what Ru ssians call the amnesty. 
To have Œ to have am
nesty, you have to commit some thing, right? 
Q: Right. 

A: Well, I don™t know what we committed. 

Q: But you got amnesty anyway . 
A: But we got amnesty anyway . 
And who do we thank for that? 
Q: Who? 
A: 
Hitler
. So, is it the irony that we have 
Hitler
 to thank for our freedom. Now, the 
way it worked, Russians at that time, when 
Germany
 attacked 
Russia
, were in such 
a bad shap e, within a few months, 
Germany
 was right into th
e Russian territory. 
They  went through the eastern 
Poland
, into German aut
hority. Russians were 
looking for help, for a
llies. At that time, 
Russi a
 held about a quarter of a million 
Polish sold iers in it Œ prison of war camp
s. Russians wanted to use those men to 
defend 
Russia
. They tr Œ to Œ got in 
touch with Polish governmen
t in exile in ri Œ in 
London
, to form Polish army in 
Russia
. They agreed Œ Polis
h government agreed 
on one condition. That they w
ill release rest of the people
, too. That included us. So 
that™s what the amnesty was about. And we 
were officially told
 by Œ by officials.

Q: By th e commandant, or Œ 
A: By th e commandant. 

Q: Not th e 
KGB
 man . 
A: No, no, commandant, that we are free peopl
e. We were given passes, legi Œ le Œ 
legitimacy.  

Q: Legitimization. 

A: That™s right. That we could travel in 
Russia
, that we can get supply of bread 
when ever w Œ it was available. But we were 
Œ main thing, we were free to leave the 
camp. 

Q: And when did th is Œ wh en did 
this come? When 
did this happen? 
A: This was fall of ™41. 

Q: So, it was several months after 
Germany
 attacked. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: So in the fall of ™41, when you fi
nally have some potatoes of your own. 
A: That™s right. That™s true, that™s very true. 

Q: Your ha Œ you™re told
 that you are free to go. 
A: We were free to go, but go fra Œ where? 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
104
A: We were told that there™s a Polish 
army  being organized in the southern  
Russia
, 
in the Œ in the 
Ka za khsta n
, in the 
Uzbekistan
. We were told that there™s Œ that™s 
where the Po lish army  is being organized. 
But how do we get there? This is 3,000 
kilometers from where we are. Now, it was 
due south wi Œ by this time the German 
armies were already approaching 
Moscow
, so there was no way we could go 
straight south. A lot of people were he
sitating, didn™t want to leave the camp 
because after all, there was 
some security here, and if 
we leave camp, who Œ then 
what?
 
My mother was a different Œ of differe
nt opinion. She says she won™t stay 
here any mo re, we have to leave. And sure
 enough, we Œ my  sister went to a Œ the 
village, which was about 20 some mi Œ 
kilometers to, fro m Œ from our camp, and 
next thing we know, she came back couple 
days later with the horse-drawn sled, 
with the farmer, and that we can leave the camp Œ 
Q: With him? 

A: Œ and he will take us to the Œ that 
village, and from there there was only few 
kilometers to the railroad station Œ railroa
d that was being built. It Œ it wasn™t built 
yet, they were just building the railroad. So
 we packed whatever 
we still had, things, 
and traveled over for a day and a ha
lf, we traveled to that village. 
Q: So you left fairly soon afterwards? 

A: We Œ we left, it was Œ was winter of ™42.

105
Q: Two. 
A: I think it was January Œ January somethi
ng, beginning of Janua
ry, I think we left 
the camp. We got to that town, that v illage, and it turned out it was about 10 
kilometers to the railroad sta 
Œ railroad. Not station, but 
railroad. Again, my  mo ther 
bribed  some of the people ove
r there with some tobacco. 
And they told us that we 
can load in, into 
the Œ get into one of the freight 
cars that was bringing supplies, 
railroad supplies, and we traveled abou
t three days. They closed the doors 

completely because they di
dn™t want anybody know what we Œ we were in the car. 
It was freezing. We had to walk most 
of the time to Œ to Œ not to freeze. 
Q: To keep warm. 

A: To keep warm. Finally we got to the to
wn that we were originally dropped off Œ 
Q: Oh, where you had walked Œ 
A: Œ where we were brought. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: We got Œ turns out ther
e were thousand people just like us out there, from 
different camps all over ye Œ 
Russia
, that part of 
Russia
. And with in a few days the 
conditions were terrible, unbelievably terrible. 

Q: Were you all at the railroad station? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
106
A: The railroad station. Finally is Œ weŒ so mehow we found out that there was a 
train preparing to go south, 
wh ich had some of those cars prepared fo r traveling, for 
deporting 
[indeciphera ble]
 people. So we got on the train. 
Q: And was it also like freight trains, or was Œ 

A: It wa Œ well, there were
 some empty cars, but just 
about everybody that was on 
that station, got on that train. Of course
 Po lish people. Three months we traveled on 
that train. 
Q: Oh my  gosh. 
A: Three months we traveled on that train. 
We lost more people on
 that train than in 
the camp. 
Q: Oh my  gosh. 
A: The worst Œ the worst was when somebo
dy got lost from the train, we never Œ 
we never found them. It just happened that
 my mo ther got lost. What would happen, 
we would get to the station, and people, 
some people from each car would run to  the 
center of the town to see if they could buy, steal or whatever some food. And 

sometime when they were th
ere, the train would go Œ 
would start going, and leave 
them behind. And like I said, mo st of 
the time, when trai
n would leave those 
people, we never seen them again. 

Q: So what happened
 with your mother? 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel  
 
January 25, 2015 
 

 
 
107
A: My mo th er was one of the people that 
went to get some food. In the meantime, 
they took our train and just moved it to
 different siding. When  my  mo ther came 
back to th e original spot, who Œ the Œ whoe
ver was in charge told her that our train 
left. She jumped on the next train and trav
eled for about three da
ys, without sign of 
our train. So  she decided that she mu st ha
ve missed it, and sh e started coming back. 
And would you know, she found us. Not on
ly did she fo und us, but she brought 
about two loaves of bread with her. 
Q: What a miracle. 
A: Was a miracle. We were desperate. We
 were four ch ildren, and their grandma. 

Q: Oh my. 
A: Four children and their grandma. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 

A: My dear, we were creatures from hell. 
Dirty. All through those three months, we 
never change clothes, we never washed
. There was enough water for drinking, 
never mind washing or Œ or Œ our clothe
s or washing yourself. Can you imagine the 
stink? Forty people in the car. We were in
 one of the towns, I don™t remember the 
name now, big town . And all of a sudden, all through th e train went the news that 
on a different siding, there™s a train just like 
ours, and in that train, there™s a priest 
that™s gonna say a ma ss. Believe me, everyb
ody, whoever could stand on their feet, 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

108
we run to  that siding, and sure enough, ther
e was in one of the cars, the gate Œ door 
was open, there was a table, and a young 
priest was sayi ng a mass. He was in a 
shreds of clothes just like we were. Dirty,
 filthy, but you could tell he was a God™s 
man. We were kneeling on the snow, we
 were praying. We
 were singing Po lish 
songs. At the end of it we usually sing a so
ng wh ich says, God, let us Œ give us Œ 
give us a chance to get to freed
om, get to pola Œ get back to 
Poland
, to our cri Œ our 
country. 
Q: I can™t imagine what that 
scen e must have been like. 
A: It gaved us spirit. It gave us a reason 
to live again. Believe me, it was one of the 
miracles that makes human do things that
 sometime you don™t think you can do it. 
Well, our luck was with us
 anyway. We got through 
Kaza kh sta n
 Œ just one Œ I 
wrote it in my life story. Wh
en we were going through 
Kaza khstan
, the Œ the 
scenery was totally flat steppe. 
Q: The steppes. 
A: Steppes, yes. And I was looking thro ugh
 that small window, and what do I see? 
Right along the railroad tracks, on the snow
, there™s a fox, a red fox. Was running 
parallel to a train, but at least he knew 
Œ you could tell he kne
w  ex actly  w h ere h e  
was going, and we didn™t have the s
lightest idea where we were going. 
Q: Oh my. Yeah. 

 
Interview with Adam Szymel

109
A: It™s stuck in my mind now. Anyway, fina
lly we got to the end Œ to bekist Œ paki 
Œ not 
Pakistan
, it was 
Bekistan
(ph). And there they told us
 to unload at one of the 
stations, I don™t remember now which one. 
Q: Was it 
Tashkent
? 
A: No, no, it wasn™t 
Tashkent
. But not far from it. And we 
Œ 
there were Œ they put 
is in the 
ko lkho z
. You know what 
ko lkho z
 is? 
Q: Explain, please. 

A: 
Ko lkhoz
 is a government farm. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Where people don™t own anything, they  ju
st work for a government farm. A farm 
was Œ they were raising cotton. 
This is main there, that™s wh
at they grow in that part 
of 
Uzbekistan
. Well, they assign us to the Uzbek 
family. They gave us a little room 
with a dirt floor, and my mother and my 
young Œ my  older sister worked  in the 

fields, and I worked 
in the smith shop. 
Q: Was this Polish authoritie
s, or Russian authorities? 
A: Russian authorities. Bu
t turned out that there 
were already some Polish 
authorities in the area, too. Finally we c
ontacted them. And they
 kept us Œ kept 
telling us to sit tight, they™ll notify us wher
e and when  we have to go. We spend, I 
don™t know, about four months up there,
 and work ing pretty hard. Finally, my

mother again, she has enough. With the last thing that she still had Œ there were two 
more Polish families in the area. They br
ibed drivers that were going Œ what we 
heard was town about hundre
d kilometers fro m where we 
were at, where there was 
already Po lish army  post. So
, one day we load ed up on 
the Œ on th e truck, open 
truck, and for next 24 hours Œ it took th
em 24 hours to drive us that hundred  
kilometers. Every 20 some k
ilometers, they had to chan
ge the tires on th e truck. 
Q: Really? It was that bad. 
A: That good. Finally, at night, we arrive
d on that station, where we™re su Œ we 
were told that there™s a Polish outpost. Su
re enough, we unloade
d at night, and we 
were sit Œ by this time it was nice and 
warm up there. This is south of 
Russia
. So, I 
think it was some time in March or April 
already, and we were
 sitting against the 
wall on the Œ on the station. It started gettin
g light, and we could hear men™s walk is 
with the military boots on the Œ on the pl
atform. My mother jumped up and there 
was a Œ one sergeant and tw o soldiers comi
ng towards us. My mo th
er looked at him 
and run to  him and started hugging 
him. He was a policeman from the 
Vorudek
(ph). 
Q: No kidding. 

A: He was Œ the man was a Œ the sergeant was a policeman from the 
Vo rudek

that knew my  parents very well.

Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: From that time on our lives changed. Tu
rn ed out that a quartermaster of the 22
nd
 
regiment, that was stationed in the place Œ place was called 
Karmana
. And he was 
a buddy of my father™s. Quartermaster. He
 made my mother seamst r ess, she Œ she 
put Œ he put her to work . My
 older sister wer Œ couldn™t go an ywhere, because she 
suffered Œ she infect Œ got infected with
 typhoid. But my you
nger sister was Œ 
joined the girls Œ yo-young 
girls™ camp . My brother and I, we went to the boys™ 
camp. And also turned out Œ 
turned out that one day, wh
ile I was in the camp, I was 
told that I have to report to the 
colonel that was in charge of 22
nd
 regiment. I got 
scared. I didn™t do an ything wrong, I Œ I sa
luted everybody, and here I am told to 
report Œ 

Q: Report. 

A: Œ to the colonel, of Œ of all the people
. Turn ed out he knew my  father when  they 

were young officers in the 1
920. When he seen my name, 
he wanted  to know if we 
know what happened to
 father. So that™s what he wa nted me to report to him. But 
like I said, from that time on,
 our lives changed. Mother 
was secure, thi Œ we were 
secured.

A: Oh God. First time I was taken to the m
ilitary mess, they get me
 vast pool of rice 
and r Œ and raisins. I ate about quarter of 
it and I couldn™t eat no mo re. I could not. I 
sat there and I cried because I can™t Œ couldn™t swallow any mo re. 
Q: You were full? 
A: I guess my  stomach shrunk so that it Œ there was no room for it already. But 

eventually, that went by. On
 the middle of August, 1942,
