ani mals?

it, but Œ 

Q: What col or Œ 

A: Œ underneath there was a concrete floor, and with gutters, so you could wash out 

Œ wash the area where t he animals were livi ng. And of course, you know, th-there

when he was born,he mov
ed int o thi s Œ it was called a colony really, you 

know. Like the Œ 
Q: It was a colony. 
A: Colony. 
Kolonia
, in Polish. But it was a straight street, very straight street, and 

houses on both sides of Œ of the street. And there was a church, there was a 

blacksmith there, who was very busy all t he time. I Œ I spent some ti me watching 

how the y were putting shoes on the horses. So, it was interesting to watch.

A: And then there were Œ there was Œ well, there were Œ I Œ I Œ 
a 
carpenter. There 
was a big place where t he owner was the carpenter, he built furniture and all Œ all 

sorts of things. So that Œ that it™s Œ that™s about all I can recollect. 

Q: Well, that™s a lot . That™s a lot. Did Œ 

A: Yes, and I remember there was a pond at  Œ at the end of this colony. I spend 
some
 ti mes cat-catching the frogs in that pond. 
Q: Did your family have land near t he house? You kept Œ you kept farm animals, 
you kept cows and horses. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And what were t he y used for? The cows, I can i magine, for mil k. 

A: Well, the horses were used to t oi Œ to work on the farm. 

Q: So, in other words, you lived on a farm Œ 
A: On Œ on a farm Œ no, the farm was attached, or the house was built on 
a 
farm, 
because every owner had a lot behind the house, let™s say, you know, a lot of area, 

where the y would raise grain, and Œ and cabbage and potat oes.  

Q: You know, one of the reasons I focus on this, is because it™s Œ it i s in some wa ys 

unusual for people to Œ it doesn™t sound like you lived in the middle of an 

agricultural pla
ce, insofar as you had a street, you had both houses on the side of the

street, and Œ  and it l  Œ sounds almost like a small residenti al area, but not a place 
that™s a farm area. And Œ and Œ  

A: Yes, some of those habitants, or the people who lived there, were of German 

extraction. 

Q: Oh, really? 
A: Yes, so it Œ it Œ it was even referred like a German col ony. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes, because there were Polish people, and some German people were living in 

there, so the buildings I can recollect , were bri ck buildings, and pretty substantial, 

let™s sa y, you know, there™s Œ they not dilapidated or anyt hing like that, it was Œ I 

think it was a fairly new colony. 

Q: Oka y. Let™s turn now a little bit to your family. Did you have brothers and 
sisters?  
A: Yes, there were four of us, and two sisters. 

Q: Oka y.

Poland
, because there were huge far Œ farms, owned by 

counts Œ

area for, you know, a lot of land. You know, for a piece of land. 

A: Yes, I t hink it was j ust average.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: F-Four, five hectares. 
Q: Could you feed a family from the four or five hectares? 

A: Oh yes, yes. So Œ 

Q: So how many hectares did he buy in eastern 
Poland
?

were gi ven land. But my father did not get, 

he bought it. 

Q: He bought it. 

A: He bought it, yes. 

Q: But tell Œ 
tell me 
Œ 
A: Because he was a brickla yer, and a builder.  

Q: Oka y, tell me this. Seven hectares, compared to four is not that much more. I 

mean, it is double.

Poland
 Œ 

A: Right. 

 
Interview with Anthony Chudzik  
 
January 24, 2015

Q: Œ for that. What was the motivation? Because it was seven hectares, rather than 
four?

you 
Œ you Œ part of the 
Ukraine

the 
Europe
, for 
Europe
. 
Q: Was the breadbasket of 
Euro pe
.  
A: Breadbasket for 
Europe
, and I Œ I don™t know why he didn™t buy more, but 
actually, that was Œ that was it. But, as I sa y, his farming was a part-
time actually.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Cause his main income was from Œ 

Q: Construction. 

A: Œ being a builder. 
Q: Yeah. So did he Œ did he build that Œ was there already a house on that land 
when you moved there, or did he build it? What did that place look li ke? 

A: Well, that was anot her example where t he land was being divided because it was 

owned by

Flossi k
(ph).

road was above, river underneath, and there were these benches, specially built for 
the women to wash their clothes i n. And t hen t hey would put up, and I took some 

dirt from the road and t hrew it on. And then one Œ 

Q: Would they catch you? 

A: Œ one lady started running after me. It was about two kilometers to the forest, or 

a little forest, so I barely reached that thing while she was still running after me, but 

I hid in the bushes and Œ 
Q: She didn™t fin
d you.
 
A: Œ a-and Œ and then I had to avoi d her, as much as I could, because I Œ I knew that 
Œ

conscientious, and that the y did everybo Œ

yt hing that  the y could to help

A: The y were afraid that Œ first of all, S-
Se
ptember, let™s sa y, first, to September 
17
th

Germans would come close to us, because 
Germany
 took over t he Œ the western 
part of 
Poland
. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Invaded the ve Œ western part, and Œ

Q: So Œ 

A: So I remember t hem ki Œ coming in on tanks. 

Q: Tell me about that. What did you see, and when did you see i t? 
A: Well, first the village didn™t have very good roads, they were li ke dirt roads. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And the y ca Œ came in tanks, so the y would raise a lot of dust, and everything 

like that. And some people, because the popul ation was mixed, some were ra Œ of 

Russian descent, let™s say, or Ukrainian, and some Poles. So those Russian people 

would welcome them, with flowers, and t he y would throw flowers at  the soldiers. 

And the y were happy, waving, things like that. We were not happy. We were Œ we 
knew that t he y are not our friends, the y are our enemies. So that™s Œ 
Q: Was it expected that Œ I mean, did you expect to see Russian soldiers in Œ 
or was 

it just something people were waiti ng to happen? 

A: No, no, no, it was sudden, came in because there was no like, radio programs 

with news on a regular basis. So no, we only saw them when the y came in to the Œ 

the village.

A: It was a complet e surprise, and t he y came on tanks, on dirt roads, i nstead of 
ma ybe just armored cars on tires, you know. No, it was horrible, it was terrible. And 
we™re scared, we absolutely Œ wel l, we di Œ di dn™t know what to do, but everybody 

was interested to see what Œ wha Œ what™s going on. And right away, the local 

people, those Ukrainians, formed like mil itia. Militia?  
Q: Oka y. 
A: And the y declared t hemselves friends of the Russians. 

Q: So pe Œ  are these people you act ually knew? 

A: Yes, and we knew, we went to s Œ 

Q: The y were your nei ghbors. 

A: Œ school together, they™re our nei ghbors, and m y friends that I pla yed with. But 

ethnic background was different. So we were scared, and i t was really bad, cause 
we didn™t Œ  Ukraini ans killed a lot of people then.

Q: The y needed him. 

A: Œ needed, right. Who wa Œ whatever the y needed, he was there t o do it. And yet, 

they were very turn Œ t urned Œ completely turned against us. It™s Œ I still can™t 
understand that, because I think that they Œ they li ved in Œ peacefully until the very 
end when Œ  when t he R ussians came in. So everybody was friendly and everythi ng 
else, helpful. But when the Russians came in, they already put armbands, those 

local Œ local Ukrainians, and they started cooperating, collaborating with the 

Russians. But it wasn™t  wrong, because the Russians then arrested those people Œ 

Q: Really? Oka y. 

A: Œ

February, and Œ and Œ and February we were taken a-awa y from Œ from t here, from 

our place. 
Q: Did you go to school? 
A: I was going to school all the time, yes.  

Q: Did school change? Did the school Œ 

A: Oh well , yes, yes, because first of all, right , the y forbid us to say prayers, 

because we used to, before lessons started, we used to say short prayers, in the 

school. But when this t ook place, when the Russians came in, the y forbade pra ying 

in school. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: So that was the first indication, you know, t hat Œ

nothing substantial to me. Nothing substantial took place. We carried on with t h Œ 

with the schooling and we could sa y pra yers and sing Polish songs, and everythi ng. 

No Œ no problem.

Ukrainians, who then welcomed the Sovi et forces Œ 

A: Right.

A: Well, early in the morning, on the 10
th
 of February, I think Sat urday, the y came 
in. It was still dark outside, maybe five o™cl ock, something like Œ we all asleep. So 

they started banging on the doors, open up, open up. So, I think Œ I don™t know who 

was the first, Father, Mother, got up, went  to t he door, opened the door, the y came 
in. There were about five Russian soldiers wit h guns Œ no rifles, with rifles and 
bayonets. And first of all, they said, do you have any weapon? 
Imet™ oruzhiye
. 

That™s in R ussian.  

Q: 
Imet™ oruzhiye
? 

A: 
Oruzhiye
. Do you have weapons? My fat her says no, I don™t have any weapon. 
Although, he did have a rifle hidden somewhere, but that was useless, you know. 

He didn™t even sa y not hing, because he couldn™t get to it, or even if he could, he 
couldn™t do anythi ng, because there™s lo Œ many of them, t hese R ussian soldiers, 
well-armed. So they say, pack up. Start packing up because we are Œ you are going 

to be taken awa y from here. And sa ys, 
you 
Œ you do not belong Œ you do not bel ong 
to here. He sa ys, Father, what? This is m y land. No, it™s not yours. We are taking 

over. It™s no more Œ  
no longerit™s yours, you 
Œ  you have nothing, just pack up 
whatever you can, food and some clothing. Because the y came wit h those vehicles, 

carriages.

what you can, take some warm clot hing and some food. So Œ and the y were well, 

like I sa y, armed. You had to obe y th
eirorders.I mean, Mother was resisting
. 

Whatever Father and sisters, maybe even I put  on, on thi s vehicle, she would throw 
off. She was very unreasonable, you know, wha Œ with them. She Œ she Œ she di dn™t 
Œ she couldn™t comprehend this, you know, what™s 
going on. Why 
Œ 
why are you 
taking us awa y? What was Œ where are we goi ng? We don™t know, but you have t o 

mov e.  We
™ll  Œ we™ll  take you awa y from here. So she was throwing t hings off. And 
the soldiers would put some food, let™s sa y, food or clothing, or Œ back on the 

vehicle, she would throw it back. The y threaten her, if you will continue like this, 

we™ll shoot you. This is what Œ what the soldiers said. And m y brother-in-law 
started talki ng to m y mother, and sa ys, 
you 
have to do what they tell you to do, 
because otherwise, you know, it ma y end tragically. That™s what he said.

drove us awa y from our home. 

Q: How much Œ how much ti me had the y given you to do this? 

A: Oh, it Œ  ma ybe hour and a half, it was something like t hat. No Œ no more than

tell you why, took us to the local school, because there was room, you know, in t he 
school, classes and everyt hing, there was assembly hall. So the y put all these people 

together in this school, and I remember that I had a violin at home. So I sneaked out 

from the school, went back to our house, whi ch wasn™t far, maybe half a mile. So 

when I entered the house, the soldiers were already cooking eggs, you know, and 
bacon, and everythi ng else, smell nice, you know, they having a good time in our 
dining room. So, I took the violin. I could have run awa y somewhere, you know, to 

Œ 

Q: Right.

some neighbors
 or something like that, but I didn™t. I took the violin, and I 

went back to my parents, which were held in t hat school. But I saw this 

[indecipherable]
 when  they already having good time on the food and everything. 
So i magine, I Œ 
I see 
Œ really terrible thing to even i magine how t hese people felt, 

that they had to leave everything behind, for what, why? Why do Œ 
why are you 

taking, what™s Œ no compensation, no reason, no nothing. Just Œ  

Q: You were never told Œ you were never told why you Œ 

A: No, you never t old. You Œ he sa ys, thi s doesn™t belong to you any more. State is 

taking over. State means 
Russia
, Soviet 
Russi a
. The state is taking over your Œ 
your possessions and everything, and they forced us out, by taking us to this school.

a ma 
Œ a Russian guy, would come and stamp these

Q: So all of this was, let™s say, from human energy, no machines at all. 

A: There were machi nes at a saw mill. 
Q: I see. 
A: Because what happened, they cut the wood, timber, and they put them in the 

river. And they would float those l ogs on the ri ver Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ to a place where t hey had 
saw mills.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And there were machinery with hooks, met al hooks, that would constantly rotate 
like this, you know, big chains, maybe 12, 14 feet long. And they Œ thi s chain would 
go into the river. And t here were men who were guiding the logs towards this 

machine. 

Q: I see. 

A: And the hooks came, brought the logs on the shore, and there were people who 

took the logs again, in human strength, human force, and cut them into shorter

A: Because there was schools for the Russian people there. So, until I was 14 years 
old, which,  only few months, then I could stop going to school, and go to work. 
And this i s what I did, cause I didn™t want to go to school there, so I started working

So  
re Œ those local Russians who lived there for Œ for many years, they were born 

there and everything, they were free, right? So they had goats. Each family had one

1934 when Œ when 
Stalin
 deliberately starved a lot of people, or send them to 
Siberia

buildings. Nobody livedthere,
 but it was quite a large area ma ybe, I don™t know, 
like few blocks of our, maybe five, 10 blocks, completely empty, only ruins. And 

mostly what Œ what was standing were chi mneys, because the y were made of brick, 

and the fireplaces. Because in that old ti me, there were just  fireplaces, and not like

. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: There was a government in exile. And we were allied with 
France

Russia
, we became ally 
Œ

out. I mean, from June ™41, di Œ the news didn™t travel too fast. 

A: No, it™s fa Œ it travel ed very fast. 

Q: Oh, it did? 

A: Except nobody took any action. We knew t hat 
Germany
 is at war with 
Russia
, 
we knew that. And the Russian told us ri ght away. It happened in June, but in Œ in si 

Œ August Œ in August, the Polish government i n exile already had an agreement 

with the Russian government. 

Q: How did this affect you in

Q: Oka y. 
A: And Œ certificates that we can travel anywhere we want, because before, we 

couldn™t leave the area. But then we Œ everybody got the certificate, like a travel 

document or something like that, and peopl e would leave. Some left ri ght away, but 

we sta yed there unti l June Œ no, June? No, no, January. Until January ™42. On the 
new year, the first of January, ™42, my family finally decided to leave 
Russia
.  
Q: And why did it  take that extra number of months to make this decision? 
A: Because they di dn™t know what to do, t he y didn™t know where to go. You 

couldn™t go back to 
Poland
, because Germans overrun 
Pol and
, you know, the y 
were at war with 
Russia
. So Œ and where were Œ people were asking, what are we 

going to do? Said well, ma ybe we should move, maybe we should go south. And 

there Œ then, most of them did go south. But that was later. 
Q: And did you st ill continue working under t he same conditions after you were

fo
rest, but the y were treated differentl y. The y were free citizens. We were free. So 
we had something to say, and we had some rights, let™s sa y, at that ti me. Because 
we already had the Polish government in 
England
, who was looking after our 
interests. So the y were talking to t he Russian government, and the Russian Œ 
Russian all owed more freedom, and better Œ better conditions and better pa y, and 
everything else. The y started treating us differently. 

Q: So their behavior was different. 

A: Absolutely, right. They changed. And l ike I sa y, me Œ a lot of people left earlier. 

Like m y brother 
Frank
, the second from t he top, he left in August. 
Q: Right away. 

A: He left right awa y. Went to south, 
Uzbekistan
, and we decided, I don™t know 
why, but m y mother and m y father were not  ready, or didn™t know what to do. So 
we sta yed until the first of January, ™42. 

Q: Oka y. Your brother 
Jusef
(ph).  
A: Yes. 

Q: Washe deported wi th you?

A: And that™s where we Œ most of the people decided to l eave

, go sout h. 

And after we reached 
Uzbekistan
, the arm y sort of extended their protection of 
Russia
, and the y t ook care of us, and 
[indeci pherable]

A: It Œ there wasn™t much problem, because when we reached 
Uzbekistan
 in 

February Œ it took two months to get from north to Œ to t he sout h. That I remember,

came to

to leave 
Russia
, t o 
Persia

or taken care of, he says Œ he said, Mother, you leave with my sister, you go, and go 
to 
Persia
, and I wil l take care of

all right. 
Q: And what about  your father? 

A: Oh, m y father di ed i n 
Russia
, we didn™t say anything about t hat. 

Q: No, let™s talk about t hat. But first tell me about this, let™s finish this, then Œ 
you 
Œ 
so you 
Œ 
did you 
Œ is that what happened, t hat your brother 
Roman
 st ayed with 
you?
 
A: Yes, yes. And he says that he t old Mother to go, that we Œ 
we will followlater 

on, because at that time it was this time on a lot of people were leaving, Polish 

people were leaving 
Russia
 under General 
Anders
. I don™t know whether it™s 
familiar to you. He was in charge of the Polish arm y, which was being organized in 

the south of 
Russia
. He was in charge of everyt hing, civilians, and the military. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Anthony Chudzik

A: So from then on we Œ we were really taken care of, because Briti sh were already 
helping to take care of the Pole Œ civilians. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: Yes. So Mother and Sister left for 
Persia 
in March, and I sta yed behind Œ 

Q: With 
Roman
. 
A: Œ and took me t o a hospital, and I spent there for two weeks in a hospital. And 

when I got well, I was released from the hospital and joined a Pol ish young soldiers.

17. 

Q: And you were then about how old?

A: He was safe, and he joined the army and then left 
Russia
 
early.And my mother 
and sister al so left in March, while I sta yed behind until August . 

Q: Oh, that™s quite a while then. 

A: Yes, quite a whi le, because then the y st opped the transpor Œ t ransports. I don™t 

know whose decisi on it was, but only a few thousand people left during the march Œ 
exodus I cal l it, let™s say exodus. And then, until August, nobody left 
Russia
. B
ut in 
August they resumed leaving Œ 
Q: I see. 

A: Œ 
because General 
Anders
 was then in charge of the arm y and everybody that 
was there, and he negotiated with t he Russian people, wit h the Russian authorities. 

So, in August they resumed, and the y moved about hundred thousand people at that 

time. 
Q: Huge number. 
A: Huge number, but it  was all concentrated. August Œ and mai nly August, yeah, a 

lot of people left.

Russia
.

Q: Also left at the same ti me? 
A: Œ yes, right, yes. 

Q: So let™s go back now, and talk about what happened to your father. The last you 

mentioned is he rebuilt this beautiful house. 

A: Yes, for the administrator there, t he main them Œ  
Q: Right. 

A: Œ boss of that area
. An
d then he started get ting sick. And on Œ on t he first, like I 

mentioned, on the first of January, we le Œ we decided to l eave. And he was already 

very sick, very sick. But, we started the journey. And on the 17
th
 da y of the journe y, 
he passed awa y, during the journe y. And i t was 
Perm
, 
a place near 
Ural 
mountains. 
He Œ he died, and I Œ I was, up to the last moment with him. We were talking, and 

he was sa ying goodbye, and you know, that Œ and he just gave up. And we left hi m 
on a platform, because when the train sto Œ I said, Mother Œ it was about one 

o™clock in t he morning, I said, Father just passed awa y. Well, so t he first ti me Œ the 

first thing, the train stopped at the station, I remember, the 
Perm
 stat ion, you know. 
The y took his body out, and put it  on a rail road platform, you know, like there are 

tracks on large stations, so there are platforms between the tracks. So there were 

already about ma ybe 50 corpses on the platform, so we just took hi m. My Œ 

Roman
, because we traveled toget her, and m yself, and we just l eft him on the 

 
Interview with Anthony Chudzik  
 
January 24, 2015 
 
 
 
131
 
railroad platform, without Œ without funeral. We Œ we tried to get  some kind of 
arrangement, but it was impossibl e, you know, there Œ it™s impossible, just leave 

here, and a-as I say, t here were already large heap of corpses there. So we just put 

some wrapping around him, left the corpse there. You know, it™s Œ that was the 

Perm
 railroad station, because in 
Russia
, there was just t ru Œ you know, 
communication, 
rai ls. That 
Œ 
that wasthe mai n 
Œ main system of moving around, 
either freight train or passenger trai n, but passenger trains very, very rare. 

Q: Was 
Œ you said he was saying goodbye to everybody i n Œ as you were talking to 
h im?
 
A: No, he was Œ we were Œ I was talking to hi m and sa yi ng goodbye. But after he 

gave up, then I Œ 
I w
oke my mother.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: I didn™t know when he is going to have the last breath. I didn™t know that. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But it happened duri ng the night, and I Œ I knew when it happens, and then I 

woke my mother,and 
Œ and I said, the first thing we stopped at t he st ation, the y put 

hi m on the platform, and Œ and he was left there, with others. But the death was t he 

normal way there, you know. Inhuman, terrible to talk about. Nobody can 

understand that. We 
were treated Œ I can™t even sa y. Worse than ani mals, 
by t
he

Russians. The y di dn™t care. Because it Œ that  was 
Stalin™s
 polic y. You are here until 
you die, but in our case, we were Œ I mean, blessed that it Œ that we di d get out of 

that hell. It was pure hell. People don™t realize like Œ 
you know,
 no Œ no clinic, no 
doctor, no help. No, it Œ the y Œ the y didn™t care. We die here or there, toda y, 

tomorrow. Nobody cared. Only you family cared, nobody else. The main thing was 
to get some food. That was the mai n thing and then I think that was 
Stalin™s 
pol ic y, 
you know, starve t he people so they cannot do anything else but think about how to 

survive. 

Q: Like you said, everybody left Œ 

A: I Œ I don™t know, I don™t know. I don™t know how to continue, because this is Œ 

this is the worst. Worst moment of the life. 

Q: Do you  want us to stop for a little bit?  
A: Oh, I don™t know. Maybe a lit tle, how about Œ  

Q: Oka y, we can Œ 
we can 
Œ  
A: Œ getting some water, or Œ  

Q: Yeah.

A: Œ the Germans were Œ were leadi ng some prisoners along the road, from one 
place to another because the y were, let™s say, t aken to do Œ do some work 

somewhere. Like dig di tches, or something like that, and t h-they were going home, 

and there was a farmer bringing some potatoes. And some potatoes fell. A raw 

potato fell on the ground, and this guy grabbed this potat o, and started Œ 
Q: To eat it . 
A: Œ eating a si Œ a raw potato. But the German pri Œ g-guard, when saw it, he shot 

hi m. And he was still eating when he was Œ  

Q: Falling.  

A: Œ falling, he was stil l eating that  bre Œ that Œ 

Q: Raw potato. 

A: Who 
Œ who wo uld believe something like that, that one man can do to another? 
Why 
Œ 
why 
Œ why did we have thi s concentration camp? Why the y™re so Œ you 
know, mean to each other? Why? 

Q: Is that a question that you were asking yourself? 

A: I want answer, why people fall for all, that t hey forget t hat the y are human being, 

that they have soul, and responsi bility. We Œ we are not vegetable. We are people 

with feelings, with soul. Those who believe, I don™t know, some people don™t 

believe that,  but I Œ I believe. I Œ I™m a religious person. So I cannot imagine how 

 
Interview with Anthony Chudzik  
 
January 24, 2015 
 
 
 
134
 
another human being could be so mean, you know, to his fellow man. But I Œ I 
don™t know. I™ve seen a lot in my life. 

Q: Did you Œ did you ever question while Œ when you were there, did you ever 
question your belief? Did you ever think t here Œ there can be no God, because a Œ 

what I™m seeing is so terrible? 
A: No, thi s Œ then the Œ no, it did not occur to me like that, but I did question, you 
know, how can these people be saved, or something like that, you know how Œ 

ma ybe there isn™t. But, if somebody commits such a cri me against another human 

being, he has to pa y for it. It woul d be unfair if these peopl e who were so sav Œ 

savages to another people, went free. I Œ I cannot imagine that. So I t hink that t here 

is Œ there must be some justice, oh, some justice that peopl e will pa y somehow, one 

way or the other. B ut ma ybe there isn™t a way. Well, on the other hand, you know, 
this is probably not for social discussion. 
Q: Well, actually, these are the ke y questions. 

A: Question. 

Q: Someti mes Œ t he-these are the key ones.  

A: Question that I have chance to raise with you, for instance, you know. 

Q: Well, I™m glad. 

A: But we discuss these things, we™re friends, I mean, you know.

Q: Yeah. You know, these are the sort of Œ like, these things that happened, and t he 
people went through, they go to t he basic questions of living, and of life. And the 

questions t hat you™re raising, are the kind t hat we wish we could find answers for. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: We wish we could know.  
A: Right. 
Q: Because how else do you Œ how do you explain such cruelty? How do you 

explain such things? 

A: Sure, yeah. 

Q: You know? 

A: Yeah. Well, I Œ I tal ked about i t a lot, because 
m y 
Œ m y daughter is married to a 
American Œ not nati ve American, but an American of so many, many years, let™s 
say. So they Œ the y often want to hear somethi ng of what I have to tell them, and 

someti mes, you know, I wonder if they ever get th-the real feeling what I have to Œ 

Q: Share. 

A: Œ 
share, yeah.
 

Q: Yeah. It™s very hard for Œ for people in soci eties that haven™t experienced 

something si milar 
Œ individual people wil l be able to understand i t, but the society

they haven™t  gone through the same kind of historical trauma. 

A: No, no, no, of course not.

A: I guess, yeah. Ma ybe Œ 
h e y,
 people said that the y woul d Œ and a lot  Œ and lack of 
water, that was very bad thing, because before got on that tank, we had these littl e 
canteens, so filled with water, ma ybe 
sa y 
a quart of water in there, and it Œ it Œ 

journe y took three year Œ three da ys. So, t hat water didn™t last long, and there was 

no water to get on t he ship. 
Q: Oh, wow. 
A: So it was real Œ that was real bad, but we knew that we are getting towards 

freedom, we are leaving 
Russia
, so everyt hing was Œ 

Q: You Œ you bore it Œ 
A: Œ 
bearable.
 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: We

know? Oh, I Œ I listen to you. Yes, and the y are one in 
Chicago
, and one other is in 

Minneapolis
. B oth very bright young ladies. 

Q: And do they understand? Do you feel that t hey understand?  
A: Yeah, I Œ I feel that the y understand, yes. They underst and, and I say Œ I was

how you 
were talking, you know, about your experiences, and Œ and the y were interested, 
and still are, you know.  
Q: Here™s ano Œ here™s a question I don™t often ask, but what would you want the 

young people of their generation, who live in 
Russia
, to understand about what you 
went through? Because the y won™t  hear about it yet from history books. They ma y 

at some point. 

 
Interview with Anthony Chudzik

158
 
A: Yes.  
Q: But what woul d you want them to understand about this experience, these years 

that you spent there? 

A: I don™t expect them to really understand, but I would like them to know how 

fragile is the human character, or something, t hat you know, people can change 
from being very nice, to being really like an ani mal to one another. Which I thi nk 
you have to be conscious of it and be careful, because you never know what these 

people are capable of doing to one another. This is, unfortunately, m y experience. 

And I Œ I hope that this will never happen t o anybody, the wa y it  happened to me. 

But the y should be aware of the human frailty, or human Œ I don™t  know what it Œ 
what it is really Œ t hat i s capable of changing t he character of a Œ of a person. 

Q: That we have it in us, and even if we don™t know we do.  
A: I do not understand. I do not understand how can people be so mean to each 
other. They can be a fri end and they so mean. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It Œ it™s Œ to me, it™s against the human nature. People should be friendly to each 

other, helpful. Extend your hand, if you can
. Don™t 
Œ don™t push away the extended 
hand, or be friendly. There Œ there i s no friendliness among people. And that Œ

that™s very disappointing. Very disappoint ing. I Œ even now I says, why do people 
fight each o-other, all over? 

Q: And these are the things Œ 

A: There Œ there are some bad, bad people, like the Œ you know, those terrorists and 

everything sa y,
 but  they are bad, the y are crim inals. But I™m talki ng about the 
average person. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: You know, average person. He can be so ni ce to you, and you can be friend, and 

everything. Somet hing ma y happen.
 
Q: Well 
Œ 
A: And the y Œ they destroy each other, or t h-they are mean to each other. Then t hat 

hurts me. The meanness of some people. I think I am very friendly to everybody. I 
am. I™m sure of it. 
Q: Thank you for shari ng all this with us today, despite t he cost, and I know there is 

a cost to it. And I appreciate that openness, and that generosity. 

A: I™m very Œ
