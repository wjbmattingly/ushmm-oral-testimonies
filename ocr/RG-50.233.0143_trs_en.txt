Abstract 
 

Eva Miodelska Young was born on October 
27, 1926 in Lipsko, Poland, a town of 10,000 
people, with several hundred Jews.  When wa
r started in 1939, the Germans began shooting 
Jews, beginning with the most religious fa milies. German established a ghetto and a curfew for 

Jews. In 1942, Eva was taken to the concentratio
n camp at Skarzysko-Kami enna to work in the 
ammunition factory.  She thinks her parents were 
sent to Tr eblinka. She never saw them again.   
 

Her parents had told her that they would l
eave valuables for her with a neighbor who had 
promised to care for her. Eva ran away fr
om the camp and went home but the neighbor 
abandoned her in the woods. Germans found her, beat
 her, and eventually 
sent her to Majdanek 
for ten weeks. She said that of some  15,000 pe
ople, only 150 survived. She was sent back to 
Skarzysko-Ka mi enna. She worked at ovens, wher
e the heat reached 200 degrees, and applied 
lacquer to bullets. She and other inmates were be
aten daily. When guards saw one male speaking 
with a fema l e , the guards forced them to have se
x in front of the other inma tes. He was later 

beaten to death. Eva had a diamond in her toot
h, and had it pulled without anesthesia, so she 
could sell it. She used the money as a brib
e for a better job, working in the kitchen. 
 

In 1944, she was sent to Krups factory in Leipzi
g, to work with ammunition.  In April 1945, she 
was sent on a death ma rch.  She escaped after about
 ten days and ma de he r way to the home  of a 
German ma n who hid three other Jewish girls. 
While working in fields, they came upon Russian 
soldiers who wanted to kill them, thinking the gi rl s were spies, and then tried to rape them. Eva 

yelled ‚Sh'ma Israel™, and a Ru
ssian Jewish soldier told his 
comr ades to stop, and leave. 
 

After liberation, she went first to Holland, and 
was among the first survivors there. She began 
working with 
Berihah
 to organize survivors for passage to 
Palestine. They sent her to France.  
 

She decided to go to Palestine, where English so
ldiers incarcerated her and her shipmates in a 
camp for ten days in March 1946. She says she wa s 
pressured strongly to wo
rk secretly, building 
Molotov cocktails for the 1948 war. She ma rried 
and had two children. The 
fa mily emi grated to 
the United St ates and settled in Brooklyn in 1959
.  Her husband died and 
later she remarried.

Side A 
 
My name  is Eva Miodelska from birth; now 
from ma rriage, Eva Young.  I was born in Poland, 
Lipsko---(3), K---.  I was born on October 27, 
1926.  I had a sister, whose name  was Tina 
Miodelska, and two brothers, Moshe, Vanhil.  My
 father's name  was Israel Miodelska and my 
mother's name  was Zelda Miodelska.  My fath
er was a businessman and my mother was a 
housewife. 
 

What kind of business wa
s he involved with? 
 

Well, we had leather goods and some kind of a 
factory.  We  bought wood in the forest and we 
made like thin, like sheets, thin sheets--- 

 
Like kindling or some thing? 
 

Thin sheets from wood.  They were used for shoe
s.  In 1942, there was 
a ghetto in Lipsko.  It 
was a small town.  I was taken to a concentration 
camp in 1942.  I was taken by force, of course.  
They came in with big cars and they threw us in like cattle.  They took us to the concentration 

camp at Skarzysko-Kamienna which is near Radom.
  It was an ammunition factory.  They were 
bringing people from Wa rsaw a
nd places nearby.  We worked th
ere in very, very terrible 
conditions.  There were about
 1500, or between 1200 and 1500 people in one room which was 
called ﬁ
augrin
ﬂ (21).  There was a lot of typhus, a lot of
 terrible things going on and every time  
they came and they put us in the line in the roll
 count, they took out people to kill.  Nobody knew 

if he would survive the following day.  But they pi
cked us out.  Certain people went to work for 
all kind of factories, all kind of parts in the f
actory™s sections.  I was working, but I ran away 
fr om there.  That time I went back to my little
 town, my hometown, because my father had told 
me  that we had a neighbor, a Polish fa mily, w
ho would help me .  They pr obably would be gone; 

they were talking that they would be evacuated 
and taken to concentratio
n camps or killed.  I 
should be aware of the fact that 
they left money, gold, quilts, linen, 
for me.   In case I survive, I 
should have where to go and the neighbor would ta
ke care of me  because it was a close friend of 
his.  So it wa s constantly on my mi nd that I ha
d where to go, in case my parents would be--with 

the brother and sister--would be evacuated.  So 
one day, I ran away from there and I went back 
to my homet own after the evacuatio
n of my parents.  I didn't hear from them.  But whe n I was in 
Skarzysko, we saw people in the ra
ilroads, on the trains, taking th
em to Treblinka.  From this 
part of Poland, they took them to Treblinka.  
We  saw them when we were crying, they were 

crying and we were--we knew that they were goi
ng some how to the gas chambers.  But after we 
saw the transport, that was in Se
ptember, close to September, I didn't hear from my parents any 
more.  I knew that they probably went to Treblin
ka with the transports 
we saw them bringing--
passing by with the trains.  I ran away from th
e concentration camp, from Skarzysko and I went 
back home. 
 
How did you arrange that? 

 
I just walked out. 

 
Just walked out? 

3
 
I was a child; I walked out.  It was toward th
e evening and I wa lked.  I had some  money with 
me because--. 
 
Was it a camp that was h
eavily guarded?   Or--? 
 
It was guarded but not as heavily, not as heavily guarded.  I had some  money because my 

brother, my younger brother--he was at that time
, ten years old.  His name  was Moshe.  When 
the war broke out, there were bombs.  In the city, 
they threw bombs, the Germans.  They ruined, 
there were a lot of broken houses.  So it was a fire; 
the whole city was like in
 fire.  He was, after 
that, the following day was quiet, or a few days 
later, I don't recall exactly the dates but it was 
approxima tely that time.  He cleaned up the bric
ks and put them together and put them like--

stored them.  Later on, the peopl
e--he was sitting and doing that instead of playing and running 
around, he was doing this kind of a thing.  When 
it quieted down, people started to build their 
houses from the ruins, so he sold
 them the bricks.  He was in 
business being ten years old.  He 
was a very smart boy.  When they took me  to th
e concentration camp, he was running after me .  
He said, ﬁHere is my money from the bricks 
I sold.  Maybe this money would help you to 
survive.ﬂ  I didn't want to take it
 but he insisted that I should ta
ke it and he threw it in the car 
where I was.  He was a child; they did not take 
him but they beat him up and he went home .  So 
I had some  money from him and I decided to go
 home  to look for the Polish guy which my 
father wrote and told me  would guard me  and be like my fa mi l y. 
 
This was after you left the concentration camp? 
 
I had it constantly in my mi nd.  So I left the 
concentration camp, escaped, with the money to my 
little town.  When I got there, my parents were no
t ther e, but I went to this Polish family which 
was right next to us.  He kissed me  and he hugge
d me  and they said, ﬁOh my child, I will take 
care.  There's no problem, I promised your father
 I will take care of you.ﬂ  I was very happy--
they gave me  food to eat, they put me  to sleep. 
 I did not tell them wher
e I came from but I just--
here I am.  The following day, he said in the even
ing he's going to take me  some pla c e, so I was 

very happy.  I didn't care where he was going to
 take me  as long as I knew some body was going 
to take care of me .  In the evening, he put me
 in a buggy, a horse and buggy and he took me  to a 
forest.  He went in a little bit, ma ybe 10, 15 mi nute
s deep to the forest.  He
 left me  t here.  He 
said, ﬁMy child, you sit here.  I have to go some place. 
 I will be back in about
 half hour or so.ﬂ  
He never came  back.  I was traveling; I was 
walking through the forest at night until the 
morning.  It was like six, seven o'clock in the 
morning, I found myself on a road.  The German 
buses were passing by, loaded with German sol diers
.  [Male voice: in truc
ks].  In trucks, big 
trucks, open trucks, like for the military.  One, 
they stopped, one car st opped and they went on 
and they said to me , ﬁ What ar
e you doing here; are you Jewish?ﬂ  I 
said, ﬁNo, I'm not  Jewish.ﬂ  I 
was speaking fluent Polish so th
ere was no sign that I am Jewish. 
 But one said, ﬁI think she's 
Jewish,ﬂ and they started beating me  up.  One Ge
rman said, ﬁWell, don't beat her up.  Take her 
with us and we™ll bring her over 
to the people from the Warsaw ghetto
 resistance.ﬂ  That time  I 
went with them.  They st arted to joke around but
 I ma de believe that I didn't  understand what 

they were saying.  When we got there, to a con
centration place, where they concentrate all these 

people from Warsaw ghetto, that was in April, pr
obably in the beginning, 
must be the tenth of 
April or the--must be before
, about the 8th or the 9th- 

4
 
Sometime in April then? 
 
That's right because the 15th of April, I found my
self in Majdanek with the transpor t.  There 
where I was in Majdanek for ten weeks. 

 

Do you remember, just to go back just a little bi
t--.  When you left the concentration camp and 
you went to this person's house, you left for the fo
rest.  Do you reme mber about what time  that 
was? What year? 
 
Well, I do reme mber because in 
the concentration camp, I me an in Majdanek, I went in '43 in 
April.  That was probably--[September '42]--by 
the end of '4 2. (unclear whether April 1943 or 
September 1942.) 
 
The end of '42, you were in that --- (93)? 
 

They were taking, in September, they were taking the parents.  That was before Rosh Hashonah, 

before the Jewish holidays.  That time--I'm still lighting a candle in the memory of my parents 

before Rosh Hashonah because that was the time
 when I saw them taking them on the railroad 
with the trains.  The railroad was right next to 
the camp at Skarzysko.  We could see the faces; it 
wasn't  that far.  We  had a gate, we couldn't go 
over the other side; it was 
on the other side of the 
gate.  But right behind the gate, there was the trai
n, the railroad.  That time I was in Majdanek 
for ten weeks.  They started to select us every 
day.  There was, of course, waiting for the dead 
because they were putting us on a count-row (102). 
 Every day they were counting us; this day 
we'r e out every fifth one; the following day, people we
re afraid to st ay in the fifth place because 
ma ybe they would take you.  But we knew that th
e one who was going to be the fifth would be 
dead.  Then they picked the seventh or the ei
ghth.  One never knew when would be his time to 
get killed.  We were at that 
time , about 15,000 people, survived
 by 150.  From my particular 
camp, place, there were more people.  But our peopl e, they started se lecting us and taking us to 

all kinds of camps, all kinds of differ e nt concentr
ation camps.  I was lucky.  They sent me  to 
Skarzysko; they sent me  back to Skarzysko.  That time I fell into a very difficult job.  I had a 

very difficult job.  I was working at ovens wher
e they used to lacquer the capsules from the 
bullets.  The reason they lacquered them was because they used to ma ke the capsules from 

aluminum, from copper.  But they ran out of c
opper--they couldn't get an
y more copper so they 
started doing it with aluminum.  In
 order not to get rusted or wet 
from the rain or from the snow, 
they had to lacquer them to pr
event them from getting rusted. 
 
From corroding, yes. 
 
That's right.  I was working by the ovens--it 
was a very tough job and a very difficult job 
because it wa s constant ly staying eight hours in one spot, taking off the capsules.  We  had to 

pick them up like in a comb, a big, long comb.  
They were falling down.  They were ma de like 
a board which they folded down.  Every capsule folded down this way and we had to pick 

them up.  They had to be full.  In order not to 
do any sabotage, not to eras
e the little teeth, they 
had to be all picked up at the same  time.  That
 was about--over 200 degrees.  We  had to stay 
there and face the heat.  In the begi nning, in the 
morning they used to give us gloves in order, 

5
not to protect our hands, but to protect the waffe
n (128), to protect the capsules.  But they got 
burned in no time so we still ha
d to work without anything, with 
hot hands.  Even today, I can 
take fire in my hand and it wouldn't burn me  be cau
se I'm so used to the hot things.  It was a 
very terrible thing to work there. 
 
Can I ask you a question?   Can we go back just a little bit? 
 
Sure. 
 

When you were on the train to Majdanek, did you go by train to Majdanek? 

 
No, they throw us in --. 

 

They threw you in the trucks; that's  right. 
 
In the trucks, they threw us in 
the trucks.  They took out horses or
 cattle and they threw us in 
there.  And straw, there was straw on the floor. 
 We were sitting on the straw, one on the other, 
on top of the other because there were hundredsof people in a wagon, in one wagon like that.  

[Male voice: No, it was a railroad 
car.] Railroad?   [No, it was not a 
truck, it was a railroad car].  
The railroad cars.  They took us in
 the railroad cars.  
It's  like a train, right.  They took the horses 
out and the cattle--like a freight
 truck.  Like the freight, that
's right, the fr eight trucks. 
 
Can you tell me  your first impressions of seeing 
Majdanek when you got off the train, what was 
happening? 
 

We were so confused that we were happy to get 
out from there.  Being there for a few hours or a 
day, we were cramped up, one against the other.  
When we got out, that was April, we s melled 
the fresh air.  We  didn't know what
 to do.  We  only thought that they
'r e going to take us to better 
places if they let us out.  But they star
ted selecting.  Put us all in one barrack. 

 
That selection happened right 
after you got off the train? 
 
Well, the following day. 
  
The following day? 
 
The following day, yeah.  They gave each of us a piece of bread and the following day, they 

told us to stay on the roll call and they started se
lecting people right away
 to the crematorium.  
They gave us work to do.  The ones who were
 not selected, they had to clean up, to carry 
stones from one place to another.  St on
es from this place to another pl ace. 
 
To keep them busy? 
 
To keep us busy, right, right.  And to clean, to 
work and ma neuver to work in anything.  They 
didn't know what to do with us.  They were be
ating us.  The people--we were very happy that 
we could do some thing--not to stay and wait for the dead.  A few days later, it didn't take too 

6
long to find out that we were there to face th
e gas chamber.  Like every da y, every hour, 
whoever was close to each other, we ma de friends with strangers.  We  didn't know each other 
but we became , in no time, we became like one fa
mily.  We were kissing each other; we'll be 

alive tomorrow, maybe we'll see you tomorrow 
ma ybe not.  If not, go and pray for us, 
whatever. 

 
Can you describe to me  a little 
bit about Majdanek?   About how 
it was guarded?   Was it a large 
camp, how it was situated? 
 

It was a large camp because there were hundreds, thousands of people there.  Yes.  It wa s very 

heavily guarded, very heavily guarded.  There we
re two barracks, two sm
all barracks; with the 
barracks was the crematorium.  First they said to
 the people that you going in to take a shower.  
They didn't tell them they'r e going to gas them.  
You had to leave the cl
othes here.  I wasn't  
inside because if I would be inside , I wouldn't come  out.  So I don't know how it was inside.  

The people who were inside never came  out.  We
 just assumed that th
at was going on.  We  had 
witnesses.  I had witnesses in different camps wh
en we went in.  In Leipzig, for example, they 
said we should go in, take a shower and leave 
everything here.  When we finished taking the 
shower, they told us to go out one other door.  
When we got out from the  other door, we had to 
pick the striped clothing with a number on usto go in and register and get a number on the 

sleeve.  My number was 804 in Leipzig, which I ca
lled out.  We never went back and we never 
had anything.  That's  all we had because seve
ral people had hidden gold, money whatever they 
brought from home .  But we couldn't  get back, 
we came out  from a diffe rent door and we got 
different clothes.  We  never saw the same  door. 
 That was -- in Majdanek, was heavily guarded, 

very heavily guarded.  When they
 took us, they said that they 
would bring us--transfer us to a 
different camp, they could only--.  Everybody was 
very happy because it coul
d only be better.  It 
couldn't be any worse.  Here we were sitting a
nd waiting to die and over there, either  they will 
take you there and die right away or we'll surviv
e.  There was only one question.  Either they 
will kill us the same  day, there will be  no pain any more so we were happy, we were very happy 

that they took us out from there.  Where 
we went, we didn't know.  But later on, we fi nd 
ourselves in Skarzysko, where we saw 
a lot of people.  It was a big camp. 
 
They took you there by train? 
 
Yes, that's  right, by train. 
 

Were you working there?   Is th
at why they took you, for labor? 
 
That's right, the labor, sure.  
It was a very, very tough job.  My
 boss was a Volks German.  His 
name  was Maiefski (190). 

 

He was Polish though? 
 

Polish, a German; he used to live in Poland.  He 
beat us up to death.  
He was beating us, blood 
was pouring from us every day.  No reason, just no reason.  He  came in and he knew that he 

had to do his job.  We  had a very hard job. 

 

7
This is the pl ace where you working at the lacquer, the ovens? 
 
That's right, in Skarzysko where I was working. 
 They call the place Lacquerna (195).  I was 
on Work R, Work A.  Be cause there were 
three works, three camps, three camps.  In 
Skarzysko, there were three camps.  One was A, 
the second B, and C.  C was the worst.  C, 
people were working in a nicoti
ne or quas (200) like acid, wher
e people got yellow and green.  
There was no way of surviving.  It happened that
 this winter I was in
 a--get-together from 
Skarzysko and I found over there two me n, who said 
they were in Work C.  I looked at them 
and I started crying.  I said, ﬁI 
don't believe you.ﬂ  He said, ﬁYea
h, I was there.ﬂ  I said, ﬁHow 
did you survive?   How did you get out alive? ﬂ 
 He  said, ﬁWell nobody believes it but we are 

alive.ﬂ  I went over to the 
wives and I said to them, ﬁY
ou don't even know what your 
husband's been through because I was in the conc entration camp and I saw them passing every 

day to work.ﬂ  I was crying constantly, that 
time I was crying.  When we got together, looking 
just at the two me n.  Everyone 
has a differentŠwe were hard at
 work.  I had a diamond in my 

tooth.  I took out the diamond and I sold it to 
a lady who was, her name  was Plachowska. She 
used to work with me  in the lacquer room.  Sh
e was sitting there, and she got paid.  She was 
an outside r because there were Polish people-- 
 
This was at Skarzysko?  

 
At Skarzysko-Kami enna.  She was from Skarzysko.  She was working for a Jewish family and 

she had a sentiment--they left her everything.  
But she came into work, she got paid.  This 
lady, I told her, she was the only person I couldhave talked to and trusted to get me  some  

money for the diamond, was her.  I had no wa
y, access to anybody.  I was talking to her and I 

said I have a diamond in my tooth and I know I'm going to die here because I was beaten 

constantly.  Throwing the empty shells on my f
ace, because I fell asleep
 because the hot, the 
heat from the oven staying for twelve hours work
ing.  I fell asleep while I was standing.  They 

couldn't work because if I didn't 
pick up the shells, they couldn't  put it in to come  down.  So 
the machine got broken.  They got punished so th
ey threw this, the empty shells in my head; 
they were sharp to wake me  up.  I wa s bleeding 
constantly, every day li
ke that.  I had a lady 
there.  She sa id, ﬁYou know what?   I will work 
here for you on two machines.ﬂ  Later on she 
married my uncle because she said she liked me so
 much, she wanted to be in the family.  She 
wanted to adopt me  as her child.  She died of 
cancer.  She helped me  a lot, at least five 
mi nutes, ten mi nutes, to relieve me to go a
nd wash my face from the blood.  That was going 
on for a long time until one day I decided there's 
no use to keep a diamond in the tooth.  I will 
have to sell it.  Who's goi ng to sell it for me ?  
 Wh at am I going to do with the money?   Where 
am I going to go?   I found out, nobody told me  but 
I just was thinking that the best place for 
me  would be the kitchen.  In
 the kitchen I would have food, 
I would work twice a day, two 
shifts, for the day shifts to cook and then for 
the evening shift to cook.  But at least it would 

keep me  alive.  I don't know if they wouldn't k
ill me but I would have something to eat.  The 
lady, I told her, there was a doctor from Pieotr
okow a dentist.  He took, pulled my tooth out.  
Of course, it was out without anesthesia, w
ithout anything.  He  t
ook out the diamond and I 
sold it.  I got 1500 zlotys the lady gave me  fo
r the tooth.  There were two sisters. I was 
washing clothing for them.  They we re working in the kitchen.  They were dressmakers and 

they were doing the dress-- 
 

8
They weren't part of the camp, were they? 
 

They were a part of the camp. 

 

They were a part of the camp?  

 
But they worked in the kitchen.  They knew 
from hometown, they came from Wi erzbinek, a 
little small town.  These two sister s were sewing
, clothing for the wife of their Germa n boss.  
He was an SA, he wasn't  an SS; he was SA.  They told her that they have a cousin and they 

would like very much that I should work with th
em.  But they got the money; the girls got the 
money from me .  She said okay, I like  you ve
ry much because you're two nice girls so you 
bring your cousin in.  I went in.  They told 
me  that some thing is going to be worked out.  
When I sold the diamond, I got the money, I gave 
the girls the money and they said that I can 
come  in to work in the kitchen.  But the boss fro
m the kitchen said that I have to have a permit 
to come; that he's releasing me from the la
cquer room.  The other guy said why, Eva?   She 
must pay you off.  That 's  what he was thinking. 
 He was very much afraid.  He didn't want to 
ask for me , he didn't want; he wouldn't  want to le
t me  go.  I said either way, one or the other, I 
will die.  I pi cked myself up and I came into work one day to the kitchen.  I left  the lacquer 

room and the boss was searching, looking for 
me.  The first day, he didn't know what 
happened to me .  He thought I got killed.  They 
put some body else in my place.  The following 
day, he found out that I was there because he 
requested to check.  He knew which barrack I 
was in.  They said I was there.  He came in and 
I start crying and I told him, ﬁThat's all I have 
is these two cousins and I want to
 be with them.  I know I'm goi
ng to die sooner or later.ﬂ  The 
boss said, ﬁDon't worry; she's not going to survive.
  You don't have to worry; they will die, 
sooner or later.ﬂ  I went in and I started worki
ng in the kitchen.  That was very good.  At least 
I had food.  I worked twice a day.  In the morn
ing we had to cook, like I said before, for the 
daily shift and in the evening, 
for the night shift but I was ve
ry happy.  I was there, working 
very hard.  I helped a lot of people with 
food, with this, with that.  But in 1944, they 
transferred us to Leipzig. 

 
So you were in Skarzysko--? 

 
From Skarzysko-Kami e nna to Leipzig. 

 
So you were there for almost--well in
to the--you said you went to-? 
 

Yeah, I was in--. They brought us, I don't know what time --. 

 

You said you went to Majdanek in April, April 15. Then you--? 

 
Of 1943. In 1944, they transferred us to Ge
rmany, to Leipzig. Krups factories. 
  
I know the name, yeah. 
 
So I worked in Krups factory.  A few friends of 
mi ne survived.  Then from Krups fa ctory, that 
was in April again.  Beginning of April, they took---. 

9
What did you do in the factory? 
 
Working by ammunition.  Controlling anti-aircr
aft, for anti-aircraft.  In 1943, 1944, I was 
working there in very difficult conditions, because
 we had to get up at four o'clock in the 
morning, some ti me s barefoot, to walk to wo
rk for two hours and two hours back.  It was 
winter, snow, rain, shine, we walked.  During 
the night, they bombed 
Leipzig.  England and 
the Americans, they bombed.  We  were constan
tly running back and forth the whole night and 
four o'clock in the morning we had to go to work.  At work, we had to constantly be aware, in 
the wake of everything.  We didn't 
have food; they gave us very little when we got back from 
work in the barracks.  There was no time of re
sting whatever.  Like a constant machine, 
working back and forth.  Then on the 15th Apr
il, yeah, April 15, everything happened on April 
the 15th, it looks like.  They put us together a
nd they said we had to run.  In Poland, in Ch---
(302), there were, the people from Skarzysko, th
ey emptied out the camps, Skarzysko, they 
closed up the camp.  I was the last one.  They 
sent me  to Leipzig because we were cooking for 
the people who were working with the transport,
 transferring the machinery to Germany.  We  
were the last ones, but the whole camp, everyone
 went to Czestochowa (?) (307). They were 
liber ated in January in Poland. 

 

In 1944?  
 
Or 1945.  We, in Leipzig, they put us
 on the death ma rch.  In April 1945, 15th. 
 
That was April 15th of 1944? 

 
It was the 14th because ten days was the deat
h march and I was liberated in 1924, I me an in 
April of 1945, April 24, 1945. 
 

Oh, so you were evacuated from--you were 
sent on a death ma rch in April of 1945? 
 

April 1945 I was on the death ma rch.  They took 
us about April 14 because ten days was the 
death ma rch on the Elba. 

 

Where did you go? 

 
Just from one place to another one. 

 
People were dying-- 

 
You were always ma rching or were you--? 
 
Always ma rching, without food, without anythin
g.  We  had--I don't know where they got food 
but some how ten days without 
food, you can™t survive walking.  But people were dying and 
they were throwing them in the valleys. There we
re valleys where we were going by the forest.  

They were pushing in the valleys like throwing 
them down.  I was--my fe et were swollen and I 
was young.  I could walk.  But my fe et were 
swollen and blood was from rubbing one foot 
against the other.  There was bleeding and I coul
dn't even walk.  I decided, we were resting in 

10
a forest--.  The Germans, there were very, very
 ma ny German people, they ran away too.  So 
we were very much under strict control.  They 
were watching us, very much so.  The German 
wome n took off, when they saw probably the 
news and they heard what wa s going on, they 
took off their dresses and they put on them, lik
e ma ke-believe, they are the ones that come  
from the concentration camp. They t hrew away their 
clothing in the forest. 
 I said to a friend of 
mi ne who was standing right next to me , I said, ﬁI'm not going any further.  I'm staying in the 
forest resting.  When everybody will leave, I will 
stay there.  Either th
ey will kill me because 
either way, I'm not surviving.  It doesn't ma ke 
any difference to me .ﬂ She said, ﬁI'm st aying 
with you.ﬂ  We were staying for a few hours 
by ourselves until everybody left for the ma rch 
again by the Elba (340).  There was a death 
ma rch going, back and forth, all around.  They 
didn't have any specific pl ace where to take us
.  Just walk without any reason, without any 
place to go.  That time, when we we re left in
 the forest and everybody left , I said, ﬁNow we 

are free.  Not exactly free but at least not on th
e march.ﬂ  There was a li
ttle river.  I couldn't 
swim.  My friend could swim so she  jumped in 
the river, pulled me  by my hair and she pulled 
me  over to the other side.  In the water, sh
e said, ﬁYou hold on to me .ﬂ  That was Clara 
(K349).  I got out on the other side.  My dress wa
s full with water and it wa s a heavy dress so I 

had to wrinkle it out from the water and it was Ap
ril, it was very cold.  We  were shivering, we 
had nothing underneath, just the dres
s. But we survived; it looks lik
e we survived.  I am here.  
We went there; we were walk
ing and we got into a little village.  We  came  upon a German 
fa mily.  We  asked for pity, ma ybe they could 
help us.  We  escaped.  We  didn't say we are 
Jewish, that we just escaped from concentr
ation camp. Beca use we had the dresses on, we 
couldn™t say that we didn™t come  from the concentration camp. 
 
You speak German or--? 
 

We speak German good, yes.  Not as fluently as
 Polish but we  spoke.  We said that we  know 
Jewish, but we are Polish.  By the way, we ma de th
e sign of the cross, we crossed ourselves. We  
ma de the prayers and said God sent us to you an
d you should save us.  In German, he said, ﬁWell 
children, it's okay. Don't be afraid.  I have some more people upstairs in my attic.  Go upstairs 

and you will find some  more people like you.ﬂ  
We ca me  up and we found over there three 
Jewish girls. They were Ruth 
Charlon (368) and her two sisters,
 who later went to Belgium.  
 
He was hiding all of them, yeah. 

 
He was hiding them.  No, he wasn't  hiding them 
all the time .  They had run away too, because 

they were in the concentration camp too.  Some how, 
we were five already.  He said that we will 
go to work--.  But they had run away a few days
 earlier because they'd been going to work, to 

the field, to work with the Germans.  He gave
 them sandwiches and they were happy.  In the 

evening, he gave them food.  We got in the same
 category like the three other girls.  In the 
morning, he gave us a sandwich a
nd he sent us; we went with them to work on the field.  They 
must have given us different clot hing because 
we couldn't go with the sa me clothi ng with the 
stripes.  I don't re me mbe r  what happened but I 
must have gotten clothing from the m.  She must 
have given me  a dress or whatever and my fr
iend, too.  Anyhow, now we were free, not exactly 
free but we were free.  We ha
d no striped clothing on and we we
re working in the field.  But 
when we heard an airplane, we ran away.  We  we
re so scared because in Leipzig, all the time , 
the planes, they were bombing.  There was no day, 
they shouldn't bomb and we shouldn't--.  In 

11
the evening, most of it was in the evening time when
 we were scared.  In the factories, we didn't 
hear so much because they were running with us 
together.  That time , we worked a few days in 
the field. One day, as we were going home  from
 work towards the evening, Russian soldiers 
came across us.  A friend of ours, one of the 
girls, was running away.  She knew Russian 
because she was from Kovel™ (Ukraine) (394), a
nd she spoke Russian very well.  She started 
talking to the Russians.  They
 thought that she was a spy, a Ru
ssian spy in Germany so they 
wanted to kill her.  I started screaming, ﬁ We are 
Jewish.  We  j ust took off the striped dresses.ﬂ  
She happened to know a little bit 
of Russian, but we were in th
e concentration camp.  They 
believed me  more than her.  They felt sorry and 
asked if there were more Jewish people.  I said, 
ﬁYes, there are three more.ﬂ  They came with 
us.  They wanted to rape us but we started 
screaming.  There was one Jewish boy.  I said ‚S
h'ma  Israel™ (402) or whatever.  He was one 
Jewish ma n, soldier and he said, ﬁLeave them 
alone.  Leave them alone and let's go someplace 

else.ﬂ  They left us.  The follo
wing day or two, we were afraid to go in the field any more.  He 
didn't let us because when we got back there 
were white flags on his house hanging outside.  So 
we said, ﬁWe are safe.  Now we are saved.ﬂ  He
 said that the guy, the German guy told us that 
he heard, ma ybe he had a radio or whatever, 
that in Leipzi g, they are concentrating the 
survivors.  They would send them to different 
parts of the world, whoever wants to go, wherever 

they want to go.  We  we nt there, we walked. 
 I don't know how ma ny hour
s we walked there.  
We got to the camp.  We  registered ourselves.
  Over there in the camp, there were already 
American soldiers.  They registered us and they
 asked us where we wanted to go.  I was thinking 
of going to Argentina because my father was, be fore the war, in Argentina, in Buenos Aires.  I 

didn't want to go back to Poland.  I was afraid. 
 It was still in my 
mi nd that the guy who had 
brought me  to forest, left me  there, I would find 
him if I went to the c
ity. I was afraid to go 
there. I was afraid to go back 
to Poland.  I didn't trust the Po
lish people because they were 
working together with the Germans.  I came from
 a small town and they all --  the whol e town, 
was working with the Ge rman people. I wasn't  going back.  I figured I had an uncle in 
Argentina.  My father had been there and he 
came back before the war. I reme mbered his 
address and I wrote him a letter.  Because I reme mb
ered my father used to
 send us letters so I 
had the address, I reme mbered the address.  I wrot e him a letter and he answered me.  But in the 
meanti me , I started working.  It was a few days 
later when I was liberate
d, the 24th of April and 
I went to register in Germany, in Leipzig, two days
 later, they asked me  where I wanted to go.  I 
said that I didn't want to go to Poland and I didn'
t want to go to Russia.  They said there was a 
transport with soldiers with pris
oners of war going back to Holla
nd, if I wanted to go to Holland.  
Two other girls and I said yes, we wanted to 
go to Holland.  Three of us came to Holland.  May 
the 1st, we arrived in Rotterdam, Holland.  The 
Queen Wilhelmi na ca me  to greet us.  Not us, 

they came to greet the soldiers but we  happene
d to be in the same  bus.  We were the first 
survivors in Holland.  They looked at us; they ha
d posters ma de up of the three of us. Put on the 
walls all over.  Over there I was a year.  One ye
ar, and then I started wo
rking with the brigade, 
with the 
Berihah
 (450).  This was the Jewish brigade, 
the soldiers from England.  They were 
working, the Jewish soldiers, the 
Berihah
, and I started working with them.  They sent me  in 
different places.  I was in a kibbutz like, se
nding people through th
e organized groups and 
sending them to Israel.  I was working with
 children, getting together the children- 
 
This was all in Holland, right? 

 
No, that was--in Holland I was a year working with 
them but they sent me  out later to France.  I 

12
was in a kibbutz in Ville-Seger near the Pyrenees. 
 
Oh, in southern France? 

 
In southern France, near Spain over there.  
We  had our concentration, kibbutzim from the 
people because it wasn't far from Toulouse (463), 
from Marseille.  There were transports from 
the people concentrated over there, sending them 
through Marseille with the boats to Israel.  
That was with the children too. 
 A lot of children we sent to
 Nahalal Kibbutz.  Nahalal 
accepted a lot of children.  I was working that time w
ith them.  Then I decided to go to Israel.  
I changed my mi nd; I didn™t want to go anymore to 
Argentina.  I wrote my 
uncle a letter that I 
belonged in Israel and I wanted to
 go to Israel.  I suffered so mu
ch as a Jew and I didn't  want 
to go any place else.  I was working with them in 194-.  Wa s liberated in 1945 and that was 

1946, in March, beginning of March.  I came with
 the boat to Haifa, 
right after Exodus, the 
first boat after Exodus.  The Eng
lish soldiers picked us up.  On
 the boat they caught us, and 
they-- in orde r to subt ract affidavits for us b
ecause there was a quota, they put us in a camp in 
Alit (484) near Haifa.  We were there ten da ys
.  Later on, everyone who had a family wherever 
they wanted to go, to a kibbutz, they were transf
erred.  But England captured us for ten days in 
the concentration--like it's a camp. 
 
The English? 

 
The Englishmen.  The English soldiers, the Engl
ish government, whatever.  They probably got 
orders from the governme nt.  They didn't do it on their own. 

 
At that time, they were in control of Palestine? 

 
That's exactly.  There was Palestine.  There wa
s not the mandate.  There was a mandate, it was 
Palestine.  It wasn't  Israel yet. 

 
So you arrived in Israel in 1946 in March? 

 
In March, I arrived to Israel, in 1946. 

 
Spent ten days in a camp? 

 

In Alit, near Haifa, in a camp.  I thought, here
 I am again in a camp.  I just got out from a 
camp and I am again in a camp.  In Israel I was working--. 

 
After the ten days, they let you out though? 

 
They let us out.  Then I met there, I met a ge
ntlema n and I married.  I 
had two children.  That 
was in Haifa.  I stayed in Ha
ifa but in 1948, the war broke out. 
 I was working with my child.  
I had only my oldest son, who was nine mont
hs old.  He was born in 1947 in May.  I was 

working and I me t two men.  They looking at me  a
nd they said, ﬁOh, that was in Haifa.  I used 
to live in K ____ (512).  They said, ﬁEva, we
'r e looking for you.  Where have you been?ﬂ  I 
said, ﬁWhy are you looking for me , 
what did I do? ﬂ   I didn't r
ecognize them.  They were in 

13
their uniforms and here they were in civilian cl
othes so they looked different to me .  I got 
scared.  They said, ﬁWe need you because we 
are desperate for people like you.  We  have to 
work with ammunition and we don't have peopl
e like you.  We need people like you.ﬂ  They 
almost forced me  to go to work and I was worki
ng in the factory Vulcan (522) in Israel.  That 
was the war in 1948.  There was, that time ther
e was a kibbutz Yagur (? ) (525) who used to 
produce, ma nufacturing weapons.  But some bod
y, it was a Jewish guy from Czechoslovakia 
who told the English government or whoever wa
s in charge  that there was a factory with 
ammunition.  He got paid a lot of mo ney a
nd they took over everything and they broke 
everything.  So they did not have
 any weapons to work with, to 
fight with.  I was that time  
working in Wulcan, by Molotov bottles in the whiskeys. 
 
Molotov cocktails. 

 

Cocktail bottles, right. 
 I was working there.  I made the 
forms for the casting.  With sand, with 
the sand imported from Belgium.  It was lik
e silky sand, special sand.  I was working ma king 
350 pieces a day and I was teaching how to do it.  Th
at time I was very much involved in it.  It 
was very--.  I had people bringing me  home  
and picking me  up.  Nobody knew what I was doing 
because we were very much afraid. 

 
In secret? 

 
In secret, was very secret.  I was trusted with
 a lot of things.  Later on when the war was 
finished, thank God, we won the war, so 
I stopped working.  I was a housewife.   
 
When did you come  to this country? 

 
To this country, I came  in 1959, October 2nd. 
 
And you settled in New York?   You lived in New York? 
 
I settled in Brooklyn.  I mean in Ne w York, ri
ght, I'm sorry, in New York and my husband 
passed away.  He passed away, then I rema rried.  
Twelve years later, I remarried.  I ma rried Mr. 
Young.  He 's a nice gentlema n and a happy person.  
He survived too from a concentration camp 
in Russia.  My husband has two children so we 
have four altogether.  
My oldest son is an 
engineer by profession but he is 
in business, he is not practi
cing that.  My youngest son Bruce 
(569) is a doctor, an M.D.  My daughter-in-law is
 here.  He's practicing 
in Maryland; he has a 
practice.  My husband's daughter, she's a director
 of research in adve
rtising and the son is 
working with the customs.  A custom broker, yes.  He is ma rried, has a family.  The only one 

who is not ma rried is the daughter but we hope
 soon she's going to get married because she's 
going out with some body. 
 

Very nice.   

 

We live in Manhattan and it's one happy fa mily.  That's  the story of my life. 

 
Let me --can I ask you?   I know that you just st
arted off and you got goi
ng and I couldn't  stop 

14
you. 
 
I'm sorry. 
 
No, it's not your fault.  That's fine, it's perfect
.  But I want to ask you a few questions about 
your childhood.  Can we go back to that part? 
 
Sure. 
 
You said--you talked about your br
others and sisters.  You talk
ed about your parents.  Can 
you tell me a little bit ab
out the town that you grew up in?   What it was like and where it was 
situated? 
 
Yes, sure.  The town was Lipsko.   My mother ca
me from Zwolen.  It's a bigger town.  Lipsko.  
(594). Lipsko, my father came from– 
 
Can you--I wanted to have you spell these out for me
 so I can find them on the ma p, if that's--if 
we can do that. 
 
L-a-p-s-k-o. 
 
[You said L-a] 
 

L-i, I'm 
sorry
. 
 
Okay, Lipsko. 
 
That's where your father was from?  
 

That's right.  Yes, my fat her was from Lipsko 
and my mother was from Zwolen.  Z-v-o-I-e-n.  
Poland.  It wa s–  

 
Side B 
 

–that it was my fault that some thing was wrong 
with me.  When I start telling some people 
what I've been through, they didn't believe me . 
 They said, ﬁHow can a young child like that 
ma ke up a story like this? ﬂ   Nobody believed me
, so I stopped talking about it.  As years 
passed, I had nightma res and I just didn't want to ta
lk about it at all.  I ma de up my mi nd that I 
wanted to forget the past.  I don't want to thi
nk about it, I don't want 
to talk about it, I don't 
want to me ntion.  Even today, I don't go--I cannot see a movie which involves concentration 

camps, Ger man soldiers, German uniforms or an
ything what has to do with the war, with the 
Germans.  I can still not face it 
and I will never watch a movie.  I said my children should 
watch it; my  children should know it.  I don't have
 to go and torture myself to see it again and 
again to br ing back the me mories.  The children,
 the grandchildren who have never seen that 
and they don't know what, all about it, just r
eading it and they'r e lear
ning now; I would like 
them very much to see and to know about it.  
But recently, I don't know what got to me , that I 

15
decided to br ing it out--to tell the st or y because  as the time  goes by and I'm getting older, I 
don't know how long I will be living.  When I am
 gone, I would like very much for them to 
know; not only them.  In general, people shoul
d know what children could go through.  But 
children growing up without parent
s and being alone in the world 
and suffering so much--.  By 
the way, when I went to Holland, after the war, I 
went to high school.  Wh
en I got to Israel, I 
went to graduate semi nar.  When I came to Am
erica, I went for business admi nistration even 
though I had the two children.  I constantly, 
I was hungry for knowledge and for education.  
But now I stopped.  I'm already in my sixties 
and I don't know how long I will be  here so I 
decided to tell my story.  In the begi nning, I wanted to write a book because I had more 

information, I reme mbered more--the German, the 
name s and the places and every little thing.  

But every day I reme mbe r  less and less and less. 
 I am very happy that I can bring out what I 
still reme mb er.  It's not too much
 but whatever it is, it's important. 
 
Let me  ask you about your town where you grew up? 
  
It's Lipsko. 
  
Lipsko, your father was born there and you 
were also born there, in Li psko? 
 
I was born in Lipsko.  My father was born in Lipsko.  My mother was born in Zwolen. 

  
L-i-p-s-k-o. 

  
What area of Poland was Lipsko? 
  
Lipsko was near Radom, Wa rsaw, around. 
  
Around there. 
  
So it was in central Poland? 
  

Center, what I said, center Poland.  
They called it congress (32) Poland.  
 
Can you tell me  a little bit abou
t the town?   How big it was? 
  

Yeah, the town was a little--a small town.  It wa
s a historical town.  It
 was a very interesting 
town.  It was located, th
e little town, it was like a--there were
 mountains, forest, and the water.  
It was a historic town because in Poland, was once a bottle which the name  was Kashimirtz 

(36).   The king was Kashmi r.  He married a Jewish woma n by the name  of Esther.  The crown 

is still there in Kashimirtz, in the synagogue, ti
ll today.  That he was fighting in Lipsko, it was 
a historic city.  A very 
little tiny city but a hist
orical city and a very b
eautiful city.  There were 
about 10,000, not even, I don't think 10,000 people, 
but there were a few thousand Jews.  The 
Jews were located like in a--I would say, a ghetto.  
They were living all together in one place.  
They were not spread out there and here but ju
st living in the center of
 the city.  A lot of 
people were, most of the people were business 
people.  The city, in general, the business 
people, the rich people, were poor
 too.  If they owned a house, 
a little house and they could 

16
survive every day and they had mone y to ma rry
 off a daughter, which you have to pay a dowry 
and prepare her clothing and ev
erything else, so--he was alre
ady rich.  There was just 
elementary school.  There was no high school 
but most of the child
ren attended Jewish 
schools, like private Jewish schools.  A 
cheder; they used 
to call it a cheder. 
  
Cheders are usually for ma les? 

  
The cheders were for ma l e s but there were fo
r girls, Beit Yaacov, the House of Jacob.  In 
Zwolen, I went to school in Zwolen as I grew a li
ttle older, when my father was in Argentina. 
My mother went from Lipsko to li
ve in Zwolen with her parents. 
 

When did your father go to Argentina? 

 
He came ba ck a year before the war broke
 out, 1938.  He was two years there, 1936. 
 
So he left in 1936?   Di
d he go there on business? 
 

He went there actually it was business.  He went, 
a sister--his sister died. 
 He was in charge of 
the money.  She left $100,000.  There were sist
ers and brothers, the governme nt took some  

money, a lawyer took some  money 
and he went there to settle. 
 When he came back, he brought 
$10,000.  Before the war, $10,000 was like a capitalist Œ was very rich.  So we were not that 

poor.  We  were quite comfortable.
  But people were not talking a
bout it.  People were afraid to 
say anything, whatever it is. 

 

You said you had a brother Œ 

 
I had two brothers and one sister, right. 
 

Were you the oldest? 

 

I was the oldest.  At that time, I was 14 years ol
d, my sister wa s 12, my br other was 10, and my 
younger one was 8.  They were two years apart fr om each other. 

 

You said that your father had a leat
her business and al
so the factory? 
 

A factory from wood. 

 

They were separate?   They weren™t together? 

 

Yeah, because in the factory from the  wood, to 
make the little cork, I 
would say, right, there 
were gentile people working there.  They were 
cutting the trees and doing
 it.  We bought it all 
from somebody and that was alread
y a running business; not in a big 
scale, in a small scale.  But 
it brought in some  income.  Later on 
this was legal, but the leather wasn™t legal.  We  had to give 
up the leather thing. 
 

Oh, later on when the war star ted? 

17
When the war, during the war, the leathe
r was not legal but 
the wood was legal. 
 
Did your mo ther help also with the business? 

 

No, she didn't help.  She was a housewife, having four children. 

 

That's  plenty of work in itself. 

 

There were no ma ids, they couldn't--maybe we 
could afford it but we were not supposed to 

have anybody working for us.  We  used to li
ve in one room.  There was everything, the 
bedroom and everything was in one room.  When
 we were in Lipsko, when we got back from 
Zwolen, our house was burned (---?)(79). 

 

Let's see, you lived in Lipsko until--? 

 

Until 1938. 

 

Then you moved to Zwolen? 

 

Then in 1939, when the war broke out, we went back to Lipsko because the house was burned in 

Zwolen. 

 

Oh, I see. 

 

Over there, we had a house.  My father was there. 
 My aunt, my father's s i
ster, used to live in our 
house. 
 
So you moved in 1938--? 

 

We moved in with them.  They took us in. 

 

So in 1938, you moved to Zwolen and then when the war broke out--? 

 

We got back. 

 

You went back to Lipsko? 

 

That's  right. 

 

Okay.  And you moved in with relatives? 

 

Right.  With my aunt.  That was 
our house but she occupied the house. 
 

I see.  The house in Lipsko, do you reme mber what
 street it was on?   Do you reme mber the name 
of the street? 

 

18
The number was 12.  I think it was Ka shmi rzka (87), if I'm not mi staken.  Kashmi rzka 12. 
 

Were you involved in any youth organizations or
 that kind of thing when you were younger? 

 

Well, I was, as a child.  As a ma
tter of fact I was involved in Beta
r.  It's like Girl Scouts.  I 
went to Hebrew School, by the wa
y, to Tarboot (92) and I went to Beit Yaacob.  We ll, I was 
still young so it didn't mean anything to me .  It was a scout thing. 

 

Can you tell me  a little bit abou
t when the war broke out in 1939?   What you did and what your 
fa mily did when--and what happened? 

 
Well, when the war broke out, there was nothi
ng to do.  The Germans came in right away, a 
few days later, the Germans came in.  First they 
started out with the Jewish people.  They are 
not supposed to have this, they were beating us
 up, going into stores, 
emptying out the stores, 
looting the st ores, taking away everything, comi ng in
to Jewish fa milies. Then they said this is 
a-–you are not supposed to go out---a curfew.  
That's right, it's a curfew.  You're not 
supposed to go out after a certain
 hour; you're not supposed to go out.  Not supposed to cross 

the bridge, not supposed to go there, not suppos
ed to go here and they started looting and 
comi ng into the houses and taking out, beating.  
They took the nicest, and they said, ﬁWho are 
the most religious people in the city?ﬂ  They took them, they put them 
against--in the center of 

the city; they put against a wall and they s
hot them all.  Rabbis 
and the children, whole 
fa milies, they shot.  Not women and children, just  the men fi rst.  Then they started shooting 

other people, killing other people, 
taking others to transport.  It
 didn't take too long, they were 
beating up and---.  There was a ghetto.  There 
was no access, you couldn™t go in and out.  So 
whatever we had, we had to live 

on. 
. 
 
So the ghetto was sealed, and there was no access? 
 
It wasn't  sealed; it was an open ghetto but it was--t
here were the guards, there were guards there 
watching. 

 
Was it a large ghetto? 

 

Well, the whole town was small so it wasn't ---. 
 They didn't have to say anything, they just 
said from this part of the city up to this street a
nd this side of the city---.  They just gave us the 
streets which we could go up to.  They didn't have to ma ke any bars around, nothing. 

 
Was the ghetto there that they set up basica
lly the Jewish part of the town anyway? 
 
Just for the Jewish people, yes.  They took out th
e Jewish people from other places and they put 
them in there. There were no gentile people mi xed 
in, in the ghetto.  Because people who used to 
live a little farther, they 
had to leave their houses a
nd come  in to live there. 
  

Did--do you reme mber when the ghetto was se
t up in the town?   A
bout how long after the 

19
invasion? 
 
I would say, the war broke out in Sept
ember 1939, was it so, yes, September 1939.   
  
September 1st was when the war broke out. 
  
That's right.  Of 1939, that's what I know, Septem
ber, I remember that.  Therefore, I set the 
candle for Se ptember. Maybe the ghetto they started doing about two or three months later.  I 

would say about 1940. So difficult to
 reme mber all these dates. 
 

I know.  Do you reme mb er how long you were in 
the ghetto?   How long you rema ined there? 
  

Well, about two years. 
  
You stayed there until 1942, until you were sent--? 
  
Until I was taken to the concentration camp, right. 
  
That first concentration camp that
 you talked about, that you said
 that you walked away from? 
Yeah, I ran away from. 

 
Was Skarzysko. 

 
That was Skarzysko and then they ended up sending you back there? 
  
That's  right. 
  
Do you remember when you were originally sent to that camp? 
  

Which camp? 

  
To Skarzysko. 
  

That was in July–that was in July of 1942. 
 I know we had vacation.  There was no school. 
 

I meant to ask you to spell this be
fore, but can you spell Skarzysko? 
 
Yes.  S-k-a-r-z-y-s-k-o. 
 
Great, thank you. 

 
You're welcome. 
  
Now--and then you were sent--you walked away 
from there in some ti me  early April in 1943. 
  
That's  right. 

20
  
So you stayed in Skarzysko for about a year?   You said you came  in July, almost a year, ma ybe 

about ten months? 
  

Right, right. 
  

Can you describe Skarzysko for me  a little bit? The camp and how it was? 
  
The camp wasn't  too big.  But where we went to the camp, it wasn't  huge, no, it wasn't .  But we 

were walking to the factory.  The factories were
 quite--we walked to the 
factories about a half 
hour walk or ma ybe longer.  There we re different 
factories.  The factories were huge, they were 
very big.  But the camp by itself was not 
too big.  There was a gate around the camp. 
  
So basically, it was a labor camp and then th
ey took you out from there to go to work? 
  
Every day in the morning and then when we walked back, they counted us. 
  
To ma ke sure you were all there? 
  

That's right. They counted us going out and they
 counted us going bac
k.  There was one--the 
people lost weight, they got sk
inny.  So one ma n was working in a factory by bush and they 
(158) they call it, I don't know what
 it is in German, in Polish was a ---.  So he took off a belt, 
a little belt and he ma de it on his pa nt s because  
they kept falling down, since he had lost a lot 
of weight.  The following day the Germans came and they saw the belt was mi ssing.  They 

took him and they hanged him in front of us. 
 Everybody had to go--the
y called us an appel 
and everybody had to–they called us on a roll-count and– 
  
Yeah, I know what an appel is. 
 
You know what an appe l is.  They st
ood--eve rybody had to face the guy and-- 
  

Had to watch? 
  
They had to watch him, how they hanging him 
because he took off this piece of leathe r to 
ma ke the belt.  There were all kinds of different incidents.  They found a ma n talking to a 

woma n, to a girl, and the Germans–ma de perfor
m sex in front of everyone.  Anyway they 
beat him;  later on they beat him to death.  We  
were children, and we had to stay and to watch 

it, everyone.  We  had the killing, the beating, th
ere was no limit, whatever.  We  never knew if 
we went to work if we would come  back.  We  never knew that. 
  

What kind of work was--what kind of fact
ory was there that you were working in? 
  

Ammunition. 

  

Ammunition?  

  

21
Strictly ammunition, strictly ammunition. 
  
I think that's all the questions I have.  If you want
 to say anything else before I turn it off--. 
  
I cannot remember. 
  
Okay, good. 

  
Thank you very much. 

  
You're welcome. 
  
Go ahead. 
  

I wrote this poem when I was in 
Majdanek in '43.  It says __ __ (180).  (Continues in Polish) 
This, I wrote when I was 14 years old. 
 
Sounds beautiful. 

 
Thank you.
