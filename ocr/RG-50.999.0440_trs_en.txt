today. W e're really glad tohave you here.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e're going to start right away. W e have just an hour, and you have so much 
to share with us.
  
So we'll begin.  You told m e that Kristallnacht, Night of the Broken Glass or 
broken glass, was thecatalyst for the decisions and direction that yourfamily's lif e tookfor the 

balance of the Holocaust and the war itself.  You were ver y young at that time, 9 yearsold.  
But bef ore we turn to Kristallnachtand the events that ledupto thatand what yourfam ily did 
right af ter that,tell us, first, about your lif e, yourf am ily, your com m unity in your early years 
bef ore the war actually began, even bef ore 
Kristallnacht.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Well, bef ore Kristallnacht we were li ving about 17
 
m iles outof  Cologne.

W eled a very quiet, norm al lif e.W e hadf riends that we played with.  My parents were in 
business in the town.  My family was f rom the area,as
 
far back as1670.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So yourfam ily li ved therefor essentially 300 years.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Generations.  My parents hadf riends in the non
-
jewish comm unity. W e 
were part of  the community.  But that all changed in 1933 when Hitler came
 
to power.  T here 
were the new rules. And am ongst them  wasthat Jewish children had to goto school, but the 
teachers didnot teach them . They were af raid toteach the Jewish children. Sothey were 
ignored. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you experienced that.
 
>> 
Inge Katzenstein: Yes.  And m y parents tookm eoutof  the school and sent me to a 
Je wish  
--
 
parochial, Jewish school.  But there was none in m y town,so when I was 7 yearsold 
I had to leave home and go and live with a gr andm other where there was a Jewish
 
school. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How far was thatf rom  yourfam ily? 
 

>> Inge Katzenstein: At that tim e, I would think it was m aybeanhour by car.  I really don't 
know them ileage. And during the school year I lived there.  At theendof  the year,m y 
grandm oth
er,m y auntand unclemoved to Holland.  Ihad to goback hom e,but I still had to go 
to school. Then I hadto travel as an 8
-
year
-
old, 7, 8
-
year
-
old, all alone,by bus to a Jewish 
school in Cologne.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At least anhour away.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: At least an hour.  Yeah.  I went by m yself . And I did thatuntil 

Kristallnacht.  On Kristallnacht

>> Bill Benson:  Before we turn toKristallnacht, am ong them any rules that were im posedon 
Jews, the restrictions of many kinds, oneof  them  was that you were notallowed to keep 
kosher any longer. 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And yet yourf am ily was a religious fam ily, as I recall.  So yourfam ily got 

around those rules asbest they could. T ell us a littlebit about that. 
 
>> I n g
e Katzenstein: W ell, we had
 
--
 
there were three ritual slaughterers in ourf am ily.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e should m ention I think yourf ather was in the cattle business.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: My father was in the cattlebusiness. T hreeof  his cousinshad ab
utcher 

store. And they weren' t allowed to kill kosheranimals anym ore.  Soasf ar as them eat was 
concerned,the way they
 
d id  it
 
was to slaughter the kosher way and then use the gun 
im mediately to shoot the animal in theheadso that if anybody would come
 
to inspect it, they 
would see thattheanim al hadbeen shotand not slaughtered.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And neighbors could hear the gunf ire.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Yes.  Yes.  And you could see the bullet hole.  Asfar as chickens were 
concerned,they took the chickens to the attic and slaughtered them there, ritually, andhid the 
knives in the chimneys. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the chim neys.  So if any Nazis cam e to inspect the house
 
--
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: T hey wouldn'tf ind them .
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time after Hitler cam e to power in 1933,what happened to your 
father's business during that tim e?

>> Inge Katzenstein:  It was non
-
existentanym ore. T he laws cam ethat in 1933 that Jews 
were not allowed to do business anymore and gentiles couldnotdo busi
ne ss with  th em . 
 
 
Until 1937,m y fam ily, of course, hadf riendsand co
-
wo rk e rs .  
T here was a righteousfam ily thathelpedus.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Anon
-
je wis h  f am ily?
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: A non
-
jewish f am ily, ri ghteous gentile who does allm y father's busine
ss 
andhanded over every single penny to him
 a
fterwards. W ehave been back to see thisfam ily
, 
h
is childrenand his children's children.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ihope m aybe later we can get a chance to talk a little bit about that.  So 
during that periodf rom 1937 on things got increasingly m ore diff icult.  Restrictionsbecam e 
greater.  Yourf ather'sability to earnan incom e was greatly im paired except you mentioned he 
hadat least thisf ellow who helped out.
 
 
In Novem ber
 
1938, Novem ber
 
9and 10, what we call 
K
ristallnachtnow, was a series of vicious attacks against Jews all over Germany. T hat had a 
prof oundeffect on your fam ily.  I think at thattim e you were away at school, in Cologne. T ell 

us about Kristallnacht, what that was and how it affected you and 
yo u r  f a m i l y.  
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Well, I wentbackon Novem ber10. I went toschool. It was aT hursday.  

I went to schoolas usual.  And when I cam eto school
 
--
 
notelevision no radio.  People didn't 
know what was going on. I went to school and infrontof  schoolthere was theSR, the b
rown 

shirts, were standing in
 
f rontof  schooloneach sideof  thedoor, each one holding a German 
Shepherd with amuzzl e.  From  the outside, our school was right next to the synagogue.  And

f rom  theoutside whenyou lookedup, we could see that the roof  of the synagogue hadburned 
out. And the policemen there said, 
ﬁC
hildren, you can't go to schooltoday
.  G
o home.
ﬂ
  
So we 
turned aroundand went home.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hich for you, of course,m eantanhouraway.
 
>> I n
ge Katzenstein: An hour away.  Instead of  thebus I decided to takethe train back. Made 
m y own decisions at 8years old.  And I took the train.  I passedby our house. And m y mother 
saw m e atthe window.   And when I gothom e, she said, 
ﬁW
hydid you com
e hom e?
ﬂ
  
I said, 
ﬁW
ell, there's no school today. T hey sent ushome.
ﬂ
  
 
 
And then we started to be concerned. W e still didn't know what 
was going on.  Later thatm orning af riendof m y uncle's who worked in 
Cit y H
all, whom he 

went to school with
 
--
 
also 
a  ve r y 
--
 
ver y ri ghteous gentile, cameover and saidtous, 
"W
hatever you hear today, whatever you see, donot leave your house."  
 
 
W ell, theadults in thefam ily startedto call each other. They 
said som ething is going on, we don't know what it is.  And m y grandm other
 
--
 
I hada very
 
astute grandm other who said, "We'renot staying here. W e're leaving now."  
  
 
E
xcu se  m e.  
 
 
My f ather calleda taxi
 a
ndput m y grandparents and my sister 
andI in the car
 
an
d told the mantodrive us to Cologne. My grandm other hadher leg ina 
cast.  She put us on the f loorboards of  the car and put her cast
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You and Jill.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Yeah.  Andput her cast onm e because they didn't wantus look
in g
 
out

the window.  And they didn't wantanybody tosee who was in the car.  And as we were dri vi ng 
away, we hear thisf iresirens.  And that meant that the synagogue was burning.  All them en 
ra n
 
--
 
would run towards the synagogue.  But m y uncleandf ather did not because the m an 
said don't goanywher e.  But they got in a car, andthey lef t.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your uncle and yourf ather.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: My uncle, father,m other. T here were three cousins in another town.  

T hey used two cars. And all went to Cologne.  My m otherhad an aunt and threeuncl
e s l i vi n g  
in Cologne ina two
-
bedroom  apartment
,  
and about eight, 10 people went there and took 
shelter there.  And that was the lasttim e I had been to m y hom e or what was thenm y home 
until 1996, when I saw it again.  But it wasn'tm y home anym ore. 
 
 
W e 
lived in Cologne. My fatherand uncle and a cousindid not 
go anywhere f or three, four days.  They drove night and day andnever stopped just to take 
gas.  Becauseas long as they were dri ving, t hey weren't being picked up. If they had been 
picked up, th
ey would have been taken toa concentration cam p.
  
 
 
T hey went illegall y acr oss the border to Holland. Therethey 
were m et by Dutch Nazis who were goin g tosendthem back. And that would have been sure 
death. 
  
SoI hadanuncle that lived in Holland who
 
knew someone in the community that had 
access to the port. And through thisaccessm y uncle obtained a letter signedby the 
Q
ueen of 
Holland at thattim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Queen Julianna?
 
>> Inge Katzenstein:  
W ilh e l min a
.  T hat said that these people cou
ld not be sent back unless 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

they had written perm ission and theborder guards did not have writ tenpermission sothese 
threepeople could stay in Holland but they were interned in a convent.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In Holland. 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein:  In Holland.  Andthey were theref rom  November 1938to May
 
1939, 
u n t il 
th e y lef t.
 

>> Bill Benson:  And you and Jill, your sister,and yourm om ,and your grandparentsand your 
aunts, you're still, of course, all in Cologne now.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: And in that sm all apa
rtm e nt. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And during thatperiod, Novem ber
 
9 through 10, throughout Germ any, 
hundredsof  synagogues were burned, thousandsand thousandsof Jewish m en were 

im prisoned, Jewish stores were destroyed in the thousands.  Do you know if  yourm other or 
your parents knew the full extentof  thatat that tim e, what was going on?
 
>> Inge Katzenstein:  I believe so. I believe by t wo or threedays later everyone knew wha t 

was going on.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know what happened to your hom e?
 
>> Inge Katzenstein:  It was vandalized, totally.  17 room s, threef loors
, t
here wasn'ta saucer 
or a cup lef t whole. T he linens were found on the compost heap. T he Persian rugs were on 

the compostheap.T he prayer books were thrown f rom the thirdf loor.  Thebathtub and the 
sink were pulled outofthe walls andfoundon the street.  It was justsheer vandalism . Andtwo 
or three days later,the Germans issueda law that the Jews had to repair andputtheir hom es 
back inthe sam e
 
--

>> Bill Benson:  And their businesses, right? 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: T he businesses were gone.  But thehom eshadtobeputback into good 
condition. And m y mother had to do thatbecausem y father wasn'tthere.  And every day that 
she went back to do this, they would com eand question heras to where her husband was.  
And she says, " I don't know.
  
I don't know wh ere he is.  Hedisappeared."   But they would 
question her constantly.  But she never told.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And not only was she and Jews who lost their homes all over as well as
 
t he  
vandalism  to stores, Jews were f orced to pay for all of that. 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Wehad topayf or all of that. And not only that, because we were lucky 
enough to go to Af rica, m y mother boughteverything knew.  T here was a Jewish exit tax that 
h
adtobepaid. So inorder to be perm itted to pack to gooverseas, you had topresent the bills 
to the governm ent and pay the governmentexactl y what you paid the stores.  And then a 

supervisor would com e and watch and checkoff  every item  to makesure that you paidfor it 
bef ore you could close thepacking boxes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So if  your mother purchasedsom ething to takef or,we'll sa y, an equivalent 
of
 
$100, you had to pay the Nazi go vernm ent
 
$100 fee on top of  that. 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: By that tim em oney didn't matter anymore.  You couldn't take it with you 

a n ywa y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we continuef rom  there, so yourfather and other malem em bers ofthe 

fam ily are interned in Holland. It's now Decem ber, moving into January
 
1939.  You would 
le
ave Germ any in June of  1939. So six months later.T ell usaboutthatperiod of tim e.  Your

m om , grandparents, you're trying to manage.  Tell us what lif e was like without yourf ather 
there in trying to m anage and yourm other and the restof  yourf am ily f iguring out where we're 
going to gof rom here.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein:  It was chaotic. There were som any people intheapartment. I was 

happy to go to school.  I continued to go to school. I didn'thave totravel anym ore. School 
was in Cologne.  And I had a lot off reetime on m y hands. BecauseI didn't go hom e after 
school.
  
My m other didn't have the tim e or the ability to watch us constantly because shehad 
to work on the em igration.  I roam ed Colognefor a lot of that tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your sister said you becam esort of a 
--
 
both a street person of sorts,and she 
described you as very def iant
 t
owards the Nazis.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you're a little girl.  T ellus aboutanexam ple of your def iance.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Oh, two things. Once when I got off the bus,a little boy calledm ea 
" dirty Jew."   He did that almost every day of the year
 
--
 
of  the week. As if  he was waiting f or 
thebus to do this.  One time Ihad enoughof it.  And I gave him  abloody nose. 
 
[Laugh
te r ]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your sister Jill was ver y proud of  youfor that. 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: And af terthat I ran away.  Andtheother times in Germany, coffee was
 
--
 
a shortage of  coffee. You couldonly buy it by a quarter pound. And a lot of the stores had a 

sign in the window, " Jews 
N
o t 
W
anted."   Andpeople were standing in linefor coffee.  And I 
was on every line f or coffee.

>> Bill Benson:  You just got in line.  And youwere able to get the coffeeto your grandm other.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein:  I came home with a pound sometimes. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hile you were doing thatand having tim ebecause your mother was so busy 
tryin g tof igure out how you're going to get out of  Germ any
 
--
 
and I think it's im portant f or the 
audience to keep inm ind that war did
 
notbegin until Septemberof  that year, September
 
1939
, 
so this is still just a little before theactual war began.
  
So how did your m om andf am ily m ake 
arrangem entsfor you to leave Germ any? 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Wehad a cousin thatm arried into thefam ily who had a cousin thatwent 
to England. And this cousinhada younger brother who cam e toEngland and studied tobe an 
attorney and then gota position inKenya.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Kenya was part of the British 
E
m p ire.   Righ t ?
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Kenya was a British colony.  Andhe, throughhis law off ice, andbecause 
we had smuggled outm oney in 1933
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ihave to interrupta second. You had told me earlier that was another 

exam pleof  your very s trong
-
willed, alm ost prescient grandmother who in1933, when Hitler 
cam e topower, said we're not using the banks anym ore.  Right?
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Shef igured out how to sm uggle m oney

>> Inge Katzenstein: T o Holland.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So 
you 
would have som e

grandparents,m y other grandm other,three auntsand three children.  My sister and I were 
separated. W e went by train f rom  Cologne to Genoa,Italy.  It was an overnight trip by train.  
Andm y sister and Iand the cousin were separated because m yf am ily was afraid that we 
would talk orf ight. And we were not allowedtom ove. W e were not allowed to leave the 
com partment. W e just had to sit
 u

You can expect children to blabber.  So they separated us.  And we couldn't f ight.  And we 
couldn't say anything
 u
ntil we went across the Swiss border.  And then we hadf reedom . And 
then we went to Genoa and went on aGerman ship.

Nazis on the ship that were going to 
T anganyika
.  
>> B ill B e n s

>> Inge Katzenstein: A German colony. T hey were accompaniedby carrier pigeons. T he 

British became very, very leery about the Jews going to Kenya. And when the war brokeout, 
the British consideredus enem y aliens. 
 
>> B i

>> Inge Katzenstein: Because we were Germ an.  No, we weren't Germ an. Theminute you 
stepped on the boat, you were stateless.

an 
enem y alien.
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Even though you were escaping the Nazis, you wer e considered an enemy

to sing asa little girl, was overheard singing and the captain of the ship told your m otherhe'd

kosherfood.  A Germ an ship.  How did you get your grandf ather togo on that ship?

>> Bill Benson:  You got him
 
off the  sh ip .
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you're in Kenya.  It's a coupleof m onthsbefore the war breaks out. And 
then, of course in Septem ber 1, war breaks out when Germ any attacks Poland andBritain 
declares war on Germany.  W hat was your life like in those early stages of  living and becom ing 
vie wed as enem y aliens? 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein: We were interned.  By then m y parents had

not quite then.  My 
parents had boughtabig cattle ranch inKenya
, t
ogether with the three cousins. 
 
There were 
f ive  f am ilie s

leave thefarm, we had to ask perm ission, perm ission in writing
,  
to leave thefarm .  In the 
beginning we didn't leave m uch,but later, again, we hadto
 
go to school and we had to leave 
the farm .  
 
 
So if  I remember right, we got perm ission to do this without 
having to go there every day.  But we left Germ any as stateless, lived in Kenyaf oreight years 

as stateless,and cam e to America just on a stateless visa. W ebecam e citizens afterf ive

>> Inge Katzenstein: Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdid thatm eanfor your father and your uncles? 
 
>> Inge Katzenstein:  It meant that they had to supervise.  They wer e lucky.  My f ather could 
go to his supervision on a bicycle.  Andm y uncle managed af arm  right next to us. Butthey 
hadto take care of theBritishf arm s. T hat was their war job, but we were still considere

of  course we had to be

didn't work. W e didn'ttreat the tutors too well .  So then m y m other m oved off the farm  with us 
to town and we attended British governmentschools. They were ve ry good, very strict.  And 
m o s t  of  
the students in the schools in Kenyawere boarding students. T hey were boarding 
sch

theboarding schoolsdid not have kosherfood.  It was really a hardship f or my m otherand

And we spoke it very well.  But I've f orgotten itall.

of  course, the war beginning in September,did you have news of the rest of yourf am ily in
