program , we will have an opportunityf or you to ask Sam  afew questions. W ehave prepared, 
now, a brief  slide presentationtohelp with his introduction. 
 
 
W ebegin with theportrait of  Sam Ponczak and his sister Giseletak
en in 1946. 
 
 
Sam was born in1937in W arsaw, the capitalof  Poland. W arsaw is indicated hereon 
this mapof  Poland. 
 
 
Sam 's father
,  
Jacob
,  
was a tailor and hism other
,  
Sa r a
,  
was a seamstress.  Here we 
see Sam 'smother and father in portraits taken in 194
0.  
 
 
Germ any invaded Poland in Septem ber
 
1939startingW orldW ar II. W hen the war 
broke out,Sam 'sfather escaped to the Soviet Union while Sam  andhis m other Sara rem ained 

inW arsaw.  In thisphoto we see German troops parading throughW arsaw after the s
urrender 
of  Poland. 
 
 
In October
 
1940, theGerm ans were closing off the ghetto inW arsaw and decreedthat 
all Jewish residentsmove into the ghetto. T he building where Sam andhis family already lived 

was in them iddle of the ghetto.  In November of  1940,
 
Sam 'smother decided to escapethe 
ghetto with Sam . Inthis photo we see a section of the wall that separated the restof  the city 

f r om  th e  ghe t t o.  
 
 
Eventually Sam and his m other were able to reunite with hisf ather. T hey were soon 
sent to a labor camp
 
in Siberia,then to atown called Syktyvkar in the Autonom ous R
egion of  
Kom i.  Finally in 1944 they were sent tothe town of  Kherson in the Ukraine where Sam 's sister 

Gisele was born.T hefam ily rem ained in Khersonf or the remainderof  the war.  Here we 
have 
a portrait of thef am ily taken in 1946af ter thefam ily returned toPoland.

Af term any morem oves Sam  cam eto the United States in1964.  He m arried Frieda in 
1965 and hadthree children.  His daughter Raquel is in the audience with us today andhis
 
grandson Jake. So if they wouldn't m ind standing to say hello.
 
[Applause]
 
T hey're joinedas well by som eother closef riendsof  thefam ily in thefront row.
 
 
Sam retired in 2009at 72f rom  NorthropGrum man.  And among many other things 
that he does, he n
ow volunteers here at them useum .
 
 
W ith that setof backgrounds, I would like you to join me in welcom ing our
 
F i rs t  
Person
, Sam  Ponczak.
 
 
[Applause]
 
 
So
,  
we have som uch to cover in this short am ountof  tim ebutf irstwe want to just say 
thank you, Sam . T hanks for being wil ling to do it and talk with us today about your 
experiences.
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  It'sm y pleasure. T hank you. 
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  Thef irst question we're going to go to
 
--
 
even thoughthe war began 
with Germ any's invasion of Poland in
 
1939, you were not yet 2 years old. Before we talk about 
the war years and theHolocaust and what itm eantfor you, let'sbegin with you telling usa bit 
about yourf am ily andyour com munity before the war began. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: W ell, as Gretchen said,
 
m y father was a tailor, m other was a seam stress.  
T hey cam ef rom  smalltowns in eastern Poland
; m
otherf rom  the town M
edzice,
 
and father 
f r om  
W ie l u n
. W hen they were teenagers, they m oved toW arsaw becausethat's where they 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

could learn a trade.  It was easier than basically sta ying in a sm all town where there was not 
too m uch of a future f or them .
 
 
My f atherhadf our brothers.  My m other hadthree brothers.  Of m yfather'sfam ily, two 
of  his brothers
 
--
 
m y father was the youngest.  T wo of his older brother
s 
i m m i gr a t ed
 
t o 
Argentina in 1930s during the 
econom ic
 
crisis in the world.  Of course, they survi ved there. My 
unclesonm y m other's side allperished.  My grandparents all perished.  W ell,that's with the 
f a m ilie s .  
 
T he only person that is related to me
 
that survived is a cousin who lives in New York.  
She'sabout12 years older than Iam .  Of course, we are in close touch.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  W ith the Germ ans' attack onW arsaw, it was  a series 
of  de va s t a t i ng 
bombings.  You
 
quickly m ade
 
the decision t
o a t t em pt  to f l e e
 
to Russia, but your mother 
decided not to go.  Can you tell us aboutthat decision and what itmeant f or you and your 
m other? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Yeah.  I was trying to putm yself  in their shoes. My m other was 28. My 

father was 29 when the war broke out and they had this 2
-
year
-
oldkid ontheir hands.  Com e 
September
 
1,W arsaw is bombed by the German Air Force.T herewas nof ightsf rom  the 
Polish Air Force, etc.  The city was at themercy of  the bombing and what have you.  In about 
three weeks
,  
f rom  what I read,about 20,000people got killed inW arsaw.  T hey were buried in 
squares and parks, wherever there was a piece of  greenery.  And suddenly there was a 

shortage of water,f ood, hunger and sim ply bedlam . T he Polish governm ent escaped. 
 
A f te r  
threedays the governm ent was gone. They all m oved to London som ehow.
 
 
I'm  trying tof igure out what m y parents and others were thinking.  It's simply: W hatdo 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
you do?W heredo you go?  People did not know what to do.
 
 
Now, m y f ather, I can say he was a lef tistandhe always liked the idea of the Soviet 
Union,etc., so he tried to convince m y mother to runaway to theeast.  And the reason I'm 
saying this, because when the war started,Germ any attacked Polandf rom the west.  And 
within two plus weeks the Russians attackedfrom  theeast. T hey met at the river, bec
am e the 
borderbetween the Nazi
-
occupied Poland and the Soviet 
-
occupied Poland.  So he wanted to 
cross that border to the Soviet
-
occupied Poland.
  
W ell,I guesshe was more determ ined. M
y 
m other didn't want to go becausef am ily ties to brothers,etc. So she stayed. 
 
 
It was sim ply a caseof complete disarray.  People were justat a loss and there were 
heavy casualties all over.  So that was the mood inW arsaw.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  Do you know how he got there?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  My father?
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  Uh
-
huh.
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  No.  I don't know.  I guessthey m ade their way towards the east by truck or 

train or onfoot.  Idon't know exactly at which pointhe crossedto the other side. And Idon't 
know exactl y the date,but I suppose that itmay have taken him afew weeks.  Most likely he 
visited the town thathe was f rom ,m aybe said goodbye to his brothers or parents. Most likely 
by sm uggling across the river; that's what it 
wa s .
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  They were able to stay in touch a littlebit, you think,af terhe was 

gone?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Asfar as I know, thedealbetween Stalinand Hitler, that this was not by 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
7
 
accident; there was adealm adebetweenthese two about attacking Poland.  And it was of a 
deal where they prom ised not to attackeachother. And part of thedeal was that the two parts 
of  Poland were able to m aintainpostal com munications between the two sides.  Of course they 
didn'thave telephones or cell phones or whatever.  But PostalService, to my knowledge,was 
running.
  
And, of  course, there was alsopeople going back andforth.  If  you knew som ebody, 
carried am essage. T his was m essengers onfootor by train or whathave you.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  So you and your mother arethen intheW arsaw Ghetto.  Can you talk 
about what we know about life thereand what was diff icult? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: W ell, of course Idon't remem ber.  Everything I know is what my m other told 

m e years later.  I know that part of the building that I was born in was destroyed. She toldm e 
thatafam ily perished there. It was partof  the same building.
 
 
Of course, the Germ ans im posedalmost im mediately I think racial laws.  Jews were 
obliged to wear thearm  bands with the Starof  David so thatthey wouldbe recognized as 
Je ws.
  
Like I said earlier, there were shortages of food, water, electricit y.  You nam e it, the city 
was not com pletely destroyed butthef acilities, the services were very damaged.
 
 
T here's an excellentfilm  by Mr.
 J
ulianBryan 
who was an Am ericanf ilmmaker.  He 
happensto come to Poland right af ter
 
--
 
m aybe thenext day when the war started.  Hef igured 
he was in Europe, hadextra f ootage, and hem ade af ilm of  thef irstweek, I believe, of the 
bombing of W arsaw.  It's an excellentf ilm  that you canprobably buy here thatdescribes the 
absolute slaughter of civi lians by
 
the Air Force. T hey were straf ing them in thef ields.
 
Hunger came upon right away.  Many people used to goto thef ields around Warsaw to dig 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
8
 
potatoe
s.  And theAir Force just killedthe people in thef ields.  So it was destruction and lack 
of  governm ent. Thatdidn't help. It got worse and worse for the Jews because the Germans 
soon af ter decided they want
ed
 
to move all the Jews, concentrate them , in
 
the W arsa w Ghe tto .  
T hat was either in their long
-
term  plans
;  
it was easier to execute these long
-
term plans.  At that 
tim e I don't think they hada def inite long
-
term  plan,not yet.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  And we putthe website and talkedabout itbef ore. T here's probably 

informationthere. T here is inf ormation thereon theW arsaw Ghetto.  I think som eof his 
footage is on the website, too.T hat's a good thing to do after.
 
 
Your m other m ade an extraordinary decision then to escape f rom  the ghetto with 
you, 
with her 3
-
year
-
old son at thatpoint.  Tell uswhat you can about how she m anaged to make 
thatescapeand reunite with your f ather.
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  I suppose m y motherf inally sa w the light and realized that there won'tbe 
m uch f uture for her and me
. Everything I'm  telling you is what she told me. I don't know how 
shem ade it to the train.  Now, you're talking about late 1940. Asfaras I know, Jews were not 
allowed to travel anymore
 
by
 
train.
 
 
She tells me thatonce she got in a wagon that the pr
iest planted himself in
 
f r on t  of  
her, told her totake off thearm band. Basically he stood inf ront of us, she says
 
--
 a
nd 
whenever the arm ory was walking b y to
 
--
 
whenthey walk by, the priest would say the wom an 
with the kid isf rom m y parish.  I don't
 
know who this priest was.  I don't know his name. I don't 
thinkm y m other knew.  If  she knew, she didn't tell me. But I am  convinced that that was the 

m an who saved m y life.  If it weren'tfor him , Iwouldn't betalking to you. Inm y m ind there is 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
no doubt about it.
  
SoI can say that I owe m y lifeto this unknown Polish priest.
 
 
Most likely she traveled east towardsm aybeher town,m aybe spent some time there 
with f am ily.  I know that she came to the edge of  that river that separated the Nazi
-
occupied 
Polandf rom  theother side, which was the Soviet
-
occupied part of Poland.
 
 
Now, I don't know whether anybody broughther
 
by cart or by horse or whatever, but 
she tells m e that she crossed the river with m e, carrying m e, at night when the river was 
f rozen. 
 
Itm ust have been late, either late Novem ber or whatever. She could walk.  It was 
apparently a cold winter.  She could walk.
 
 
Later I realized that we couldhave been shoteither by the Germ ansor by the 
Russians.  You see som ebody walking at night through the river. 
 

>> GretchenSkidmore:  I can only im agine the concern she had going across. W hat do you 
think her biggest f earwas then
 
with a 3
-
year
-
old?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Her biggest fear was being shot.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  But it was the noiseyou were m aking? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Oh, yeah, yeah.W ell, what was happening, she tells me that she was 

slipping on the ice andfalling down.  And to me it was funny.  So I was laughing out loud.
 
[Laughter]
 
At night the voice carried, and she was desperate;didn't know what to do with m e.  She gave 
m epicturesthat she carried with her, pictures of  thefam ily, I suppose, hoping that I'll just look 
at them and keepm y m outh shut.  Iendedup tearing them  all apart.  Ifeel guilty to m y sister
,  
tom yself  because I don't have any pictures of m yf am ily, m y parents f rombefore the war. So 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
that was the priceof  getting through the river .
 
 
I know that we got caught on theother side. She was telling about the dogs and 
guards and we got caught.  W e were kept in som e place som ewhere.  I do not know thedetails 
how, buteventually we  got reunited with m yfather. So whether it was a week later orm onths 
later
, 
I just don't know.
  
I regret to say I wasn't m atureenough to spend tim e with them in trying 
tof ind out all thede
ta ils .   I t ' s  lik e a lwa ys  b u s y  wit h  lif e
; f
orgetting the im portant things.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  W hat are some of those early recollectionsof  seeing your father then 
in that time period? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: W ell, I guessm y f irst self
-
awareness of m yself  wa
s 
--
 
we were sen
t to th is 
labor cam p.  It's in western Siberia, about 1,500
 
m iles I thinknortheast of Moscow.  I 
rem em ber that cam p because I rem em ber seeing m y father working as a lumberjack. Hewas 

nota tailor. He was a lum berjack there. Andhe was cutting trees.  T hat region is very rich
.
  
T hey had lots of trees.  I'm  not sure whether that was already when the war between the Nazi 

Germ any andSovietsbegan orbefore that. Anyhow, I rem em ber that camp,my father cutting 
the trees,and m yf ather up to his neck inthe river pushing the logs down the river.
 
 
Oneof  the things
 
--
 
we ll, I don't rem em ber being constantly under guard, you know, 
being af raid that I'll be shot. I didn't seem any of  the guards because it's in them iddle. There 
was nowhere to
 
run.  If you run, you will probably never m ake it anywhere.
 
 
I do remember seeing people who seem ed to m e very strange.  I wa s a young kid, a 
boy, butI rem em berthat strangenessfor many years.  Many, m any years later I was 
discussing this with m y father
 
and said
 w
hatwas it with these people
.
  
Never m ind thatthey 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
were unhappy; they were strange
-
lo o
king people. He toldm e they were Jews and Pols and all 
kinds of people in that labor camp.
 
 
T here were shortages.  First of  all,there was hunger. Som eof  them, lots of people, 
starved and what have you.  But there were problem s with people,for example, who usedto 
sm oke. W ell, there were no cigarettes. Andyou know how a sm oker when hedoesn'thave 
cigarettes, he becom es strange
-
looking.
  
T hey used to sm okem oss. W hatever they could 
m ake believe is tobacco, that's what they used to sm oke.  
 
 
Some people likedtodrink. W ell,there was no vodka,no wine.  Butfor strange 
reasonsthere was cologne.  Andthose people would drink anything that had som e alcohol in 

it.  I'm surethat it had some ill eff ects on their nervous system and brains. 
 
 
A lot of people were also physically exhausted because they were not used to heavy 
labor
; t
hedoctors, lawyers, people whodid not physicall y work bef ore the war. T his
 
wa s  a 
demanding kind of work.  He was telling m e that was probably the reasonf or seeing a large 

group of people that not only were unhappy,they were ill and they just couldn't, well, takethe 
conditions of that camp.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  And as if  those conditions aren't rough enough, then the next place 

thatthey sent you was across the continent to Siberia. Right? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: W ell, no.  Syktyvkar was a little bit north. It was the actual capital of that 

Autonom ous Republic.  And there they engagedm y f atherto work in a big clothingfactory.  
Andm y m otheralso worked inthat because that's where they were m aking unif orm s and coats 
for the m ilitary. T hey needed, you know
 
--
 
m ost of  the Russianm en were on thef ront, I guess 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
f ighting.  So they
 
could useany laborforce that they could getto support the war effort. That's 
what I remember. I rem em ber thef actory where m yf ather worked andm y m other worked. 
T he conditions were rough. W e got coupons, ration coupons,f orfood; I remember.  So t
hat 
basically was thebeginning of m y m ore self
-
awareness.
 
 
Sykt yvkar also brings sadness to m y memory because I rememberm y two t win 
brothers were born there and then they died about two m onths later. I don't know the 

circum stances. I don't rem em ber if  Iasked my m other. She never talkedabout it.  So I know 
she took
 
it
 
very, ver y bad. 
 
 
T hat's where we were there throughthe wartim e. T he things I remem berbeing in 
som e sortof  kindergarten. There was aP.A.system . T hrough theP.A. system  I rem em ber
 
hearing how the glorious Soviet Arm y was ret reating. T hey didn't call it retreating. T hey called 

it something else.  From  the Germ ans. And thenI rem em bertheannouncement of the big 
bat
tle of Stalingrad.  And from  that on when the Germ ans were retreating, of course, the 
glorious Soviet Arm y was advancing, etc. 
  
So you know, I was f rom  early onf ully aware of the 
war.  T hat's aboutthat.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  This was thebulkof  the tim e that you spent. W hy did youend up in 

the Ukraine? W hy didthey m ove you at thatpoint?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: T alking to myf ather, it's known that the Sovietswere tr ying to convince 

these ref ugees that if  they wanted to, they wo uld give them passports and make them  Soviet 
citizens if  they wanted to rem ain in Soviet Russia.  It rem indsm ea little bitaboutthe present 
situation in Ukraine.  You know, we'll gi ve you  passports,m ake youa Russian, and now we'll 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

13
 
have a causetof ree Ukraine or something like that. 
 
 
My parents obviously didn't choose to get Soviet citizenship oranything like that.  
T heir m ain goal was to get backto Poland andf ind out
 
--
 
f indtheirfam ily because they did not 
know what was going on. There was noT V.W edidnot know anything about what was going 
on in Poland
f
or the longest time.
 
 
So when the Germansretreatedf rom  theterritory of  what usedtobethe Soviet
 
--
 
there was apart of theSoviet, they moved usto Ukraine just to, I suppose
, 
to stage eventual 
re t u rn  f rom  U k ra i ne
,  
Poland because it was closer, what have you. W eendedupbeing 
put  i n  
a settlementoutsideof this town Kherson where m yf ather andthree other Jewishf am ilies, all 
tailors, got back to wor king as tailors.  Don't ask m e who gave them the work or how.  I just 
don't remember. I wasn't interested.  But I do rem em ber that in the room we had
 
--
 
we had a 
large room
.  W
e had sewing m achines andall theother toolsthat were needed to do some 
sewing.  And that's where the sewing was happening. 
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  And you got go to school there.  Right?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  I went to f irst class
t
o the Russian school.
  
Actually, Russian becamemy 
f irst language because while I was a 2

ol d or 3

old kid in Poland, I know m y parents 
--
 
even thoughthey knew Polish butthey talked with each other in Yiddish,a Jewish lang

.  
S

knew

I learneda little bit of thenative language which was T ata or Mongolian origin in Kom i.  
But right now I know m aybe two, three words.

that you were Jewish and thatall of these things happened in connection to that?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  I sort of  becam eaware of  m y Jewishness.  Mindyou, m y parents were not 

practicing religion even though they were rais ed as Jews andm y father went tothe schoolfor 
theboys, etc. He knew how to pray and m y m other as well, write and read Yiddish. But they 
were not practicing. 
 
 
Now, one day I rem ember I went with m y parents to af lea market in Kherson. I saw 
strange

looking people. T hey were invalids, m ostly without legs orwithout a hand.  I 
rem em ber one of them, he was on som e sortof  a little cart, started to yell at us,atm y parents 

andm e, " Jews, how the hell"
 
--
 
pardon m e

" survi ve?"   It was off ensive.  M y f ather,every 
Je w
ish m an was called Adam  and every Je wi sh wom an was calledSara
h  
even though m y 
m other happens to be
 
--
 
her nam e isSara.  He was insulting us as Jews, Jews, etc., how the 
heck you survive.  I looked at m yf atherand he said, "W ell, you area Jew.  So that's why you 

hear that."  Som y awareness

I wasn't aware that I was Jewish wh en I was in Kom i because 
if  I was with other kids, I was like any other kid.  W e wouldplay

h atever it is that we did.  But 
there was no you area Jew or a Pol, whatever.  So that was m y awa reness,my ethnic

T he eventthat sticks in m y mem ory ver y strongl y was that
 
--
 
Idon't know whe
th e r it 
was Septem ber or October.  In the fall of 
‚
45, m y f ather takes me to a
 
--
 
to a place in town.  I 
did not know where we were going.  I didn'task so many questions. My f ather says let's go
, 
I 
go .
  
So we com eto this large room , and I see lots of young m en inm ilitary uniform s. I 
watched them. T hey sort of stay standing. They m ove like that.T hey chant.  Andm ostof all 

they were cr ying.  I couldn'tunderstand it
; y

Many, m any years later
 
I rem ember the episode. I askedm y father
w
hat was it about 
this place
.
  
He also rem em bered it well.  Sohe says, you know, this is where the Jewish 
m em bers of  theSoviet Arm y

the Jewish soldiers of the Soviet Army

the war was over a nd 
they were cr ying.  It wa s Yom  Kippur. They were crying becauseof what they saw in Poland 

and in Germ any. T hey went through the concentration cam ps and they could see pilesof  
dead bodies,destruction, horror. T hey knew what was happening. So that was a tim e to cr
y.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  Did you rem em beranything thenabout leaving and going to Poland, 

that part of  the trip?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Yeah.  I remember it well. I guess the Soviets organized whole trainloads 
of  people to move to Poland. W e traveled ina cattle car trainf ull ofpeople in February

about three weeks

Reichenbach.  It was a G
e rma n
 
town.  
 
 
Of course, Ididn't understand the politics but as part of the agreementbetweenthe 
Soviets, between Stalin and Roosevelt and Churchill, there was a realignment of borders in 
Europe.  Part of Pre
-
war Eastern Germ any was given to Poland.  And the Soviets took 
them selves partof  Eastern Polandf or them selves, which was part of Ukraine at the tim e. As a 

result, there was am
assive  
m igration of  people.  For exam ple, at that timeW arsaw was 
com pletely destroyed. W e weref rom W arsaw.  T here was no point m oving people toW arsaw.  

On the otherhand,Polish governm entat thetim e hada whole pieceof  land on the western 
side which was basically not destroyed. It was all German, little all
-
Germ an towns called 
Lower Silesia.  And that's where we were
 
se ttle d
, a
 
whole trainload of  people that cam e with 
u s.  
 
Af ter af ew weeks in som e com monarea wewere gi ven an apartment.  I never seen 
anything as beautiful as this apartm ent. T here was still an old Jewis h
 
--
 
pardon m e, an old 
Germ an lady who lived th
ere.  And the town changed f rom Germ an Reichenbach to Polish 
Dzier zonio w.  It was a cute little town.  It still is.  It was largely unaffectedby the war.  And at 
theend of the war it was inhabited by mostly elderly Germ an people.  
 
 
And within afew m onths, maybe two months or so,the German lady who was the 
owner of that apartm ent, likem any other Germ ans, was asked to leave
.  S
o you could call it 
m aybe in some ways ethnic cleansing because all the Germ ans were asked to move on.  

Many of  them  m oved on to
 
Germany, either the western part or eastern part;I don't know. 
 
W e ended up having this nice apartm ent.

m any things I rem em ber because atthat time I was old enough.  I 
rem em ber going with m y f atherabouttwice a week to thetrain station because we knew that 
the trainsf rom  theeast were com ing intotown. W alking with him  into the cattle car wagons, 
he would look aroundand see if he knew anybody, etc.  On one occasionhe walked inand 
recognized af riend ofhis from his town, f rom his little town bef ore the war.  He said,

So that was

that's also where I started

Idon't remember, second, third grade of

didn't know a word of Polish at the tim e. My father, being a tailor with other tailors, organized a

I think now

was to f ind 
f a m ily a n
df indf riends.  That was the onemost im portant thing for all of  thesepeople who 
survi ved, of  course. 
 
 
You probably know, many of you, when 9/11happened in New York , you remember 
the second day therewas on the walls outside the ground zero were pieces
 
of  paper, "
H
a ve  
you seenm y uncle?," m y sister, whatever, my child.  AndI have seen the same scene in1946, 
47,48 in Dzier zoniow.  There was abuilding that was given to the Jewish community.  They 
hadtheir comm unity authorities, com m ittees, whatever. 
 
I happened to walk by and I've seen 
the same kind of  little papers,handwritten
, 
"have you seen
."  
ﬁHave you seenm y f riend?ﬂ  I
t 
was al ways som ebody lookingf or som ebody.  Strangepeople,f riends, became realf am ily.  
T hef am ily thatm y father found in that cattle car became m y uncle,m y aunt, and the children 
m y co u sin s 
s
t ill t od a y.   
 
 
Som y parents weref riendly.  My m other
 
--
 
people used to com efor dinner or what 
have you.  It was all the talkaround the kitchen table was always the same
, i
n Yiddish.  
A nd  
they were saying ho w they survi ved.  How did you survi ve?  Have yo u seen such and such?  

T hat was the conversation. 
 
 
I  wa s
 
--
 
I understood Yiddish even though I couldn't write or read but I understood it 
well becausem y parents talked all day am ong them selves and whathave you. 
 
O ne  of  t he  
things that I vividl y rem em ber isf rom  peoplewho survi ved the concentration cam ps. W hyit's 

im portant, because it's a bearing what I am  doing now.  These people would come. W e would

Thetongue would loosen up, and the tears wouldf low.  T hese

people who survi ved concentration cam ps were describing how they sa w thoseunfortunate 
ones who were ledto their deathsbecause Jews were taken in groups to the gas chambers.  
T hey knew where they were going.  T hey wer e not unaware. T hey knew because they had 
seen before them .
 
 
Oneof  the sayings early on in the early days of  Auschwitz was the only way out of  this 
place is through that chim ney.  And they were showing them  that chim ney. 
  
So the
se people 
who were condemnedknew where they were going. 
 
 
Now, it seem s that they always repeated thesam e thing to theseother ones that 
stayed behind.  Rem em ber us.  Don'tforget. Tell us
 
--
 
tell people, tell the world what 
happened
.  D
on't f orget us. 
 
It just stuck inm y m ind.  So this was the m ost
 
--
 
the only wish they 
had.  Because they knew.  They justdidn't want to beforgotten.  And tome that's very 

s ign if ic a n t.  
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  Sam , you're in Polandf or really a lot of  schooling, many mo
re ye a rs ,  

until the late 1950s.  Can you talk about what it's like to grow up in Soviet
-
controlled Poland, 
going to Catholic school? W hat are your recollectionsf rom that envi ronment? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Yeah.  In 1946, I suppose inf all, the school year had started andm y father 
sentm etoa Polish school. Atthat time inPoland the schools were run by the Catholic church.  
W hen I came in, I was shocked because it was thef irst time I saw Jesus on the cross inf ront 
of m y desk.  I didnot know what it was,
 
who it was.  T he other thingwas that there were 
classes of catechism.  There were afew Jewi sh kids. W e were asked to go to the playground 

andplay.  And so we did.  Unfortunately af terthe class the kids,for som e reason, were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

20
 
chasing us. It wasn't one of m y happiest periods. 
 
 
Later on in 
‚
48
 
--
 
well, af ew things happened while I lived in Dzier zoniow that are 
signif icant tom e.  In 
‚
48 m yf ather tookm eto W arsaw.  I did not know wh y, but he tookm eto 
the train. W e wenttoWarsaw.  And I rem ember, well, I was at the opening cerem ony of  the 
unveiling of  themonum ent f orthe Holocaust ghetto,f or theW arsaw Ghetto Uprising.  Itwas 
theonly arm ed uprising against the Germans in Germ an
-
occupied Europethat was of 
signif icance. T here were m any uprisings of  minor scalebutthis was onethat took the 

Germ ans alm ost months to beat with Air Force and artillery, etc.,against a bunchof  Jews 
arm ed with Molotov cocktails and pistols.
 
 
So I was there. And thatm onument is still there.  It is standing inf ront
 
of  t he  
about
-
to
-
be openedmuseum  of Jewish history there.  So I was there atthe event. David
 
Be n
-
Gurion
, I don't know whether he was already a prime m inister of Israel, but he gave a speech 

to this crowd of afew thousand, 2,000 maybe, Jewish people.  I
 
have a f riend here who is a 
w ri t e r,  He n ry 
G
reenberg, who says he was in the crowd, too. But I didn't know, of  course. 
 
Af ter the speechesand what have you,m y father walked with me through thatportion of the 
town.  At some pointhe stopped and said," I
 
think this isthe building that you were born in."   
T here were no signs.The ghetto was completely leveled.  If  you can im agine a city of about a 

m illion orm orepeople being destroyed tothetune of 95%.  So I remem ber climbing the ruins 
and just seeing
 
ruins as far asI could see. So this isone of thesem om ents.
 
 
Lateron we hadm oved to a larger town.  It used to be called Bresl
au  
before the war in 
Germ any.  My f ather moved theref or reasons of  work.  I went to anon
-
religious school.  I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

21
 
probably had
 
oneof my best years in that school.  I hadm any Jewish and Polish
 
--
 
Ch ris t ia n  
Polish and Jewish f riends.  Eventoday when I travel to Poland, I visit with them .  Ienjoy being 
with them .T hat's where I finishedm y high school
, D
ip loma .
 
 
In 1957, becaus
e  
again of  an anti
-
Sem iticevents,the Polish governm ent decided to 
allow Je ws to leave Poland. They gave us passports, one way out. Andm y passport lost its 
validit y 90 days af ter issuance.  I still have it. And we lef t.  Originally we were going to go
 
t o 
Israel like m ost of  the people, but because of the state of health of  m y m other m any f riends 

told us don't com e becauseSally is not going tom ake it there.W edecided to take a chance to 
go to Israel via transit visas through France hoping that if  we
 
get offthe train and we get som e 
peoplem aybe help usto rem ain in France. That's how we endedup livin g f or about two and a 

half  years in France. 
 
And,again,a new language.  Yeah.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  And that'sfollowed by Argentina,f ollowed by the United States. 
 
 
So given the tim ethat we have rem aining, I know that it'sm aybetrue that you guys 
have some questionsfor Sam . W e wanted to leave afew m inutesf or that.  And at the endwe

>> GretchenSkidmore:  Perfect. There'sanother gentlem an right there.  Striped shirt. 
 
>> I'm  som ewhat surprised that your parentsstayed so long in Poland after the war.  I think 
this was probably the exception thanthe rule?
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Letm etell you.  At the end of  the war, say May
 
8 or 9 of 1945and afew 
years later
,  
there were about 300,000 Jews that rem ained inPoland.  Most of them were those 
who escaped earlier to Soviet Russia and survi ved and returned. Som e survived on the Aryan

23
 
side underfalsedocum ents. Som e survi ved the ghettos and the concentration camps. Som e 
survi ved in theforests, what have you. 
 
T he f irst immi
gration, large
-
scale, went about 150,000 
o r so  Je ws lef t .  
 
 
Maybe not toom any people know, but af ter the war, when the war was over, about 
1,500 Jews were m urdered inPoland. It'sone of the biggest
 
--
 
it happened on 4th of  
J u ly
 
1946, whereabout 40
-
s om e
 
Jews, m en,wom en, and children, I think, werem urdered 
because 
of som ethingknown as a libel, B
l oo d 
L
ibel, crim e. Thehistory is that apparently a 
Polish young boy disappeared,and there was a rum or that the Jews grabbedhim and used 
him  to sacrif icehim
 
tom ake Matzah. And asa result,a group of Polish people wentahead 
and m urdered 40
-
some  Je ws.  
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  So this is them yth as part of an anti
-
Sem itic traditional thinking.
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:  Correct.  T heseevents
 
--
 
this one standsout, but there were sm all events 
on a smaller scale in little towns. T he reasonfor many of  these events were purely 
m aterialistic.  As Jews were li quidated
 
--
 
that m eans m urdered, taken out
 
--
 
the ghettos were 
em ptiedand the Jews were killed either in concentration camps or shot, cemeteries, etc. They 

l
eft behind som e real property: hom es, shops, etc. Thepolicy of Germ ans was notonly kill the 
Jews but elim inate all traces of  Jewish lif e.  And one way of doing this is to have Pols occupy 

their homes sothat
 
there wouldn't be apart of town that is justempty hom es. So they 
encouraged people to take over thesehom es, etc. 
 
 
Now, som e of these Jews sur vi ved
, 
either theowners or the relatives of  theowners.  
And they had the, quote/unquote, audacity tocom e and try to claim  their home.  Maybe they 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
24
 
even didn't claim .  Maybe their presence just in the little town was a threat that som ebody 
would take away theirhome. There were elem ent
s 
of  a nt i
-
S em it ic
 
in the Polish population.  
T hey took care of that by killin g thesepeople.  In the town, the little town thatm y father isf rom , 

there weref ive people anda boy that was shot in thehouse that one of these people owned 
butapparently thef am ily that lived there gave them  a room . And in that room thesepeople 
we r
e shot.  So about 1,500. T hat created atrem endous stressf orpeople to leave.
 
 
Now, m y parents alsoattem ptedto leave butit wasn't easy to leave.  You had to leave 
to go som ewhere. They didn't have any relatives in the UnitedStates, etc. Mostof  the
 
people 
were counting on relatives sending them  invitations, 
v
isa s,  e t c.  
 
 
Now, they, I suppose
 
--
 
m y f ather was lef tist.  Maybe hedragged his feet.  But 
eventually he toldm ehe did get a visa to goto Argentina,butthat's when the iron curtain 

cam e down. So during thef irst wave of  im m igration, likeI said,m aybe about 150,000, 
200,000 Jews left justfor fearof  being killed.
 
 
Now, the next one is the one thatI lef t in. And that was about50,000
-
so me  Je ws.   
T hese were mostly tailors, shoem akers, you
 
know, these kindsof  professions. T hey left. And 
m ostof them  went to Israel. T hat was a tough timef orthem because in Israel you don't need 

20,000 shoe makers. And they had ahardtim ethere.  So that was the second wave.
 
 
T he last wave happened in 1968 where the President of Polandaccused Jews of 
being spiesfor Israel.  And that's another 20,000, 30,000 lef t.
 
 
And today there'sm aybe 8,000,10,000people who consider them selves Jews in 
Poland.  So that's the situation.

day, about 2
 
m illion people spilled into 
T
i me  
S
quare in New York.  And,of course, those 
people went crazy.  T his was the day of  victory.  T hey hugged, kissed, kissed, hugged.  I could 
see thatover the span of time the8thof  Mayof  2014 became alm ost a non

event for m any 
people. And that's what worries m e.  History tends to justm ove into some recesses of 

m em ory where they're hard tof ind. Andf rom m y pointof
 
view, this m useum  is a teaching 
m useum .  It's teaching the history of  what happened.  Andhistory is not just dates and nam es 

andplaces.  It'sthe ideas.
 
 
T hem ost im portant thing I want you to thinkabout is thatthis Holocaust that 
destroyed m y fam ily 
andm any other people's fam iliesbegan with words, with words and 
sentences.  It was not just because they hadexterm ination groups,etc.  It's simple words. And 

I wish that you all becom eteachers,parents and teachers. T eachthe kids that words are 
im p
ortant. T hey needto know what happened.  If you don't know, God help us, itmay repeat 
itself.  History tends to do that.
