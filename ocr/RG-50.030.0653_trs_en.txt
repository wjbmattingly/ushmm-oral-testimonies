Q .So Leni, can you tell me , where and when you were born, please?
 
A. I was born in Bamber g, Germany on August 25, 1930.
 
Q. Okay. So can you tell me  your name  at birth?
 
A. My na me  at birth was Caroline Leni Eckmann.
 
Q .Can you tell me  your father™s and mother™s name s, please?
 
A.My father™s name  was  Ludwig Eckmann, and 
my mother™s name was Sami  Eckmann Stern.
 
Q. And wha t  years where they born?
 
A. Just a second.
 
Q. Hello. My father was born on October 
6, 1889, and my mother was born June 13, 1887.
 
Q. Now, were they both born in Germany?
 
 A. Yes they were born in Germany.
 
Q. And do you know whether your 
grandparents had been immi gran
ts or were they born in 
Germany too?
 
A. They were born in Germany as we ll.
 
Q. We re you an only child?
 
A.Yes, I was.
 
Q. What language did you speak at home ?  
I am supposing German, but was there any 2
nd
 
language?
 
A. No. Just German.
 
Q. So would this mean that your 
parents did not know Yiddish at all?
 
A. No.
 
Q. So can you describe the apartment where 
you lived?  How ma ny rooms , of what kind of 
furniture?
 
A. We  lived in a small town, the house was over 1
00 years old. It actually belonged to my great 
grandfather; it was               a typi
cal small town structure. How ma ny rooms, it had two 
bedrooms upstairs, living room, dining room
, kitchen, no indoor plumbing. It did have 
electricity.
 
Q. How common was it to have elec
tricity in your town in 1930?
 
A. I think most everybody had electricity inmy town in 1930, not plumbing, but electricity. 
 
Q. So this was a house, not an apartment.
 

A. It was a house.
 
 Q. So was there an outhouse in the garden?
 
 A. There was an outhouse.
 
 Q.  Did your fa mily keep any ma ids?
 
A. Not in my time. They had ma ids before 
I was born. My mother was a professional dress 
ma ker. And she always had 2 apprentices in th
e house. But there was no other help. A ma iden 
aunt lived with us.
 
 Q. Your mo ther worked out of the home . So 
the apprentices, they we
re learning her craft?  
 
 A. My mother worked out of the home .   A
nd they were learning the craft. My mother was 
actually a teacher.
 
Q. Wa s she selling her clothes?
 
 A. Yes, she was selling them, she ha d a thrivi
ng business. In those days
 people didn™t go to a 
store to buy clothes, especially 
not in a small town. Clothes were
 ma de to order. That was her 
business.
 
Q. Now, were these clothes ma de for a spec
ial occasion, or  were they every day clothes?
 
A. No, these were everyday clothe s.
 
 A. The fact that your mo ther worked. Did you feel like that she did that 
to bring income, or was 
it assume d that she would work?  
 
A. That was her profession. She trained for years in
 that field. I supposed she certainly helped to 
learn how to do that. My father was a cattle trader
. We  had a farm with a couple of cows and that 
is what he did. And he tended the fields. And sh
e was at home , that was her business. That is 
what she chose to do.
 
Q. Was the farm spatially located in a different 
pl ace than the house, in a 
separate place from the 
house?
 
A. Yes, in Germany the farms were on the out
lying areas, and all the 
houses were in town.
 
Q. So I a m guessing he wasn™t the only farmer in the village.
 
A. Oh no, it was a farmi ng community. It was a very small town. There were ma ybe 300 people. 

There were more cows than people there.
 
Q. I see. Wa s your father the one to go into the business of farming?
 
A. Oh no. That farm belonged to my  great-gra
ndfather and maybe beyond that. That farm 
belonged to my mother™s fa mily. He came into it from another communit y.
 
Q. I see. Wh en he came into it, did you know if
 he already had training 
in agricultural activity?  
Or was that new to him?
 

A. I really don™t know much about my father™s 
family. I would imagine because he also came  
from a neighboring small town, also a far ming community. So I would assume  that yes.  But I 
really don™tknow much about that 
side of the family at all. 
 
Q. Okay. Where both your parents Jewish?
 
A. Yes, Orthodox.
 
Q. Orthodox, where there any other Jews in this town?
 
A. There was one other fa mily. Yes. I don™t reme mb
er their last name. It was a very complicated 
thing. They were a rather strange family. They
 had no children. These people living there. There 

was an old mother and a son and 
a daughter. Ne ither one of them 
was married. So I did not have 
much contact with them.
 
Q. So would they go to so me  sort
 of place where they had a mi nyan?
 
A. Yes, in a neighboring town, there was a 
synagogue about twenty mi nute walk. About 10 
Jewish fa milies lived ther e. So that  was where the two fa milies in my town would go to worship.
 
Q. Do you recall the name  of this town?
 
A. Yes it was Hofhei m.
 
Q. Ok. Hofheim. So I a m assumi ng that your 
family kept Kosher. They kept the Sabbath?
 
A. Oh yes, strictly Kosher. They were ultra-orthodox.
 
Q. Ultra-orthodox?
 
A. Yes, ultra-orthodox, and I didn™t like it.
 
Q. Can you describe what you mean by ultra-ort
hodox?   Wh at kind of rituals did they keep?
 
A. They kept every ritual. They kept Kosher. 
My father went to synagogue Friday night and 
Saturday, every holiday was kept. They prayed 
3 times a day. My father put on tefillin every 
morning. Strictly- orthodox.
 
Q. Your father would have si
de curls then, is that right?
 
A. Pardon me?
 
Q. He woul d have worn side curls?
 
A. No. He did not. And my mother did not wear a wig.
 
Q.  So they did not have a 
special wa y of dressing, then?
 
A. No. They were not Hassidic. 
I think that the German orthodox 
Jews were different from the 
Polish orthodox Jews.
 
Q. Right, right.
 

A. I am assumi ng that the village 
knew that your fa mily was Jewish.
 
A. Yes, they did.
 
Q. Did you feel that you were treat
ed differently because of this?
 
A. Well, I felt different because first of all 
when I was a youngster, school was 6 days a week 
and I could not go to school on Saturdays. Also 
on Thursday afternoons, I had to go to Hofhei m 
for Hebrew lessons, so I was taken out of class.
 And also the fact th
at I could not eat at 
anybody™s house, and the fact that we did not ce
lebrate Christma s or Easter. So yes, I felt 
different, and I resented it, and I made up my mi nd
 at a very early age that were two things I 
would never do, to live in a small town 
and be orthodox.  And I kept to that.
 
Q. You kept it. Okay. So when you said that you 
could not eat at other™s people house, did this 
mean that you were invited to other pe
ople™s houses, that you were friends?
 
A. Yes. I had friends at school and they woul
d say, ﬁCome over for lunch,ﬂ but I couldn™t eat 
there. And I felt excluded, no question about 
it. But once, you know whe n Hitler came into 
power, the whole thing changed. 
That was another story. But be
fore that you know, I felt I had 
friends and I had no problem socially, and my pa
r e nts certainly didn™t. They were part of 
community. My grandfather was one of the grand ol
d gentlemen there. He was very influential in 
the community and he wa s very well respected.
 
Q. So you fe el like  your fa mily 
was integrated in the community?
 
A. Oh definitely they were.  They were Germans fi
rst. The fact that they were Jews, that was like 
being Catholic or Protestant.
 
Q. Did your grandfather or anyone
 in your fa mily hold any infl
uential position, like in the 
ma yor™s, office, or the civil service?
 
A. No, not officially. But he wa
s certainly infl uential in the community in his time. And I didn™t 
fi nd that out until later, when I went back to
 Germany and the townspeopl e told me that. 
 
Q. Can you tell me  his name  please?
 
A. His na me  was Ulius Stern. He died in July 
1930, the same  year that
 I was born, in August. 
The townspeople told me that when he died, th
ere was a formal procession from our house to the 
Jewish ceremony, which was quite a distance. Ev
erybody was dressed in for mal clothes and top 
hats. And my teacher  who was the most anti- Semitic person in the town in my ti me , he led the 

procession. I mean, I was absolutely fl
abbergasted when I heard that story.
 
Q. Do you have any way of ma king sense of that?
 
A. No, I don™t, but this wa s before Hitler came in 
to power when the attitude towards the Jews in 
Germany was very cordial. Jews held high positions
 in every field, me dicine at universities. The 
attitude only changed when he cam
e into power. My fa mily lived th
at area for at least 300 years, 
and they were totally integrated into the community until that time. Hitler™ s power began in 

Bavaria, and that is where I lived, and the attitude  changed overnight 
 

A. Now, would most of t he villagers 
have been Ca tholics. Or was it a mi x?
 
Q. No. Most of the villagers were Prot estant, there were 2 Catholic fa milies. They were 
some what ostracized as well. I th
ink they would have been next. 
 
Q. Now you had the feeling they had been ostr
acized. Do you recall anything in particular that 
ma de you reme mber it that way?
 
A. We ll I think what I reme mber is that they 
also had problems with 
neighbors and attitudes, 
nothing like the Jews suffered of 
course. Definitely, I think if I 
reme mber it was a long time ago, 
and I was just 9 years old. 
 
Q. Would this have been people talking behind 
their back?  Was there 
anything specific that 
gave you the sense that there was hostility towards them?
 
A.No, that just seemed to be the 
talk. I cannot recall anything specific.
 
Q. Were there any Catholic
 children in your school?
 
A. We ll I am sure these people had children. I d
on™t reme mber their name s or specifically who 
they were. 
 
Q. So you don™t have any me mory of the ch
ildren being treated differently in school?
 
A. No, I don™t.
 
Q. So you said that your teacher was the most vo
cal anti-Semite in your town. Was this person a 
gentlema n or a lady?
 
A. No, it was a ma n.
 
Q. Did this ma n ever say anythi
ng in school or outside of school?
 
A. Absolutely, he was Gestapo, he wore the unif
orm, and he was the one who threw me  out of 
school. There was a big       portrait of H
itler hanging in the school. It was a one room 
schoolhouse. Grades one to eight.
 
Q. So, all the children were in the same room, 
and they were all taught by the same teacher?
 
A. Yes, they were all taught by the same  man. 
 And as he entered the room every mor ning, we 
had to salute this portrait, not me  but th
e children had to salute this portrait. 
 
Q. Of Hitler?
 
A. I was not allowed to do that.
 
Q. What year was this?
 
A. This was 1937 or 1938 was the year that it star
ted.  Actually it stated earlier 1937, they started 
harassing the Jews, breaking window, and 
they started to make life mi serable.
 
Q. So you™re saying, they started, was 
this your village or
 in the region?
 

A. This was Germany in general. That was a ye
ar before Kristallnacht, 
which was in November 
1938.
 
Q. Did anything like that
 happen in your village?
 
A. We ll yes, they broke windows on Kristallnacht
 in Hofheim. In the adjoining town the 
synagogue was destroyed, Jewish 
businesses were ruined. They never ma de it to us, because 
supposedly they got tired out. So we did not suffe
r any destruction during th
at time, but it started 
earlier.
 
Q. That was what I was going to
 ask. How early did it start?   
 
A. I  would think if I reme mber correctly, 1937, mi d-1937.
 
Q. And had you started sc
hool at age 6 or earlier.
 
A. No, 6.
 
Q. So, from first grade on, this was the same teacher the whole time.
 
A. Yes, he was there for years.
 
Q. And from the first day, the ch
ildren were supposed to salute. 
Is that right?  But you were the 
only one who was told not to?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And do you reme mber the teacher
 singling you out in other ways?
 
A. Yes he was constantly harassing me , and of 
course the Hitler youth wa s very active in this 
town. He was the one who was in charge of it a
nd of course, I could not
 join. He poisoned the 
whole atmosphere. There is no question about that. 
 The ultimate outcome  was that he threw me  
out of class, in front of everybody. And I have 
never forgotten it. That was such a trauma tic 
experience in my life. 
 
Q. Do you reme mber the date when he threw you out?
 
A. It was 1938; I don™t reme mber the exact date. 
 
Q. Do you reme mber his name ?
 
A. Pardon me?  No, I should reme mb er his name , but I don™t.
 
Q. Now you said his actions poisoned the enviro
nment but at the same time you said you were 
invited over to your classmates™ houses and familie
s. So were there certain classmates that 
weren™t part of this environmen
t. Can you explain that to me ?  
 
A. We ll. This didn™t happen until the latter part
 of 1937, so I am talking about friends from when 
I was a little girl, from prior to going
 to school until the latter part of 1937.
 
Q. And then did things change for you significantly socially? 
 

A. Yes, because I think pe ople were afraid to be
 friends with me  at that point. Because  I think 
that the town in general became very anti-Semitic.
 
Q. Do you reme mber anyone in the to
wn doing or saying anything in public?
 
A. Not really, except the teacher, w
ho humiliated me at every opportunity.
 
Q. Do you know what kind of things he said?  
 
A. Just that the Jews were not welcome, a
nd I could not be part of the Hitler youth, and I 
couldn™t salute, not that I wa
nted to.  I just could not 
be part of the community.
 
Q. Did he make you sit in a special pl ace in the classroom?
 
A. No. There was really no special place. It was one room.
 
Q. Do you recall your pa rents di scussing the situation worsening?  Do you reme mbe r  them being 
worried or scared?
 
A. Yes of course, that is why they sent me  to Belgium.
 
Q. So when do you first reme mber them starting to get worried?
 
A. They first started to get worried when th
ey broke all of our wi
ndows, imprisoned all the 
German Jewish ma les. Also, I don™t reme mber if it was 1937 or 1938 when they imprisoned all 

the German Jewish males.
 
That would have been Kr istallnacht. 
 
A. No, it was before Kristallnacht. It was... I 
keep forgetting... A Jew was accused of killing a 
German and that was the excuse to imprison al
l German Jewish ma les. And my father was 
imprisoned.
 
Q. How was he was taken away?
 
A. They came to the house and took him away.
 
Q. Wa s it a local policeman, some one you knew?
 
A. Or they had to meet at a certain place, I don™t really reme mber.
 
Q. So your father was impr
isoned and taken to jail?
 
Q. How long was he imprisoned?
 
A. A couple of months.
 
Q. Do you recall your mother™s actions or feelings at this time ?
 
A. She was very scared. We vis
ited my father in jail, and he
 was bruised and his head was 
shaven. We  used to bring food, a basket of f
ood. I reme mber my mother had brought a chocolate 
bar. Chocolate was a luxury in those years: 
one of the big European chocolate bars. And I 
wanted to give it to my father as a gift. But th
e guard did not let me . He wanted to take it from 

me . But I wouldn™t give it to him and I ran away 
with the chocolate bar. And then he came home 
shortly ther eaft er.
 
Q. Do you reme mber when he came home -what month this was?
 
A. No, I don™t 
 
Q. Would this have been early 1939?
 
A. No it was earlier than that
, it was before Kristallnacht 
 
So your father was in jail before Kristallnacht?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. So your father gets out of jail, what did he do after that?
 
A. He resumed his norma l life He tended to the fi
elds and the animals. He lived as norma lly as 
possible.
 
Q. Did he know why he  had been arrested?
 
A. Oh yes, of course, everybody knew, it was well advertised.
 
Q. Did you know where the jail 
was, was it in your town?
 
A. No it was in Hofheim.
 
Q. Does that mean that the other Je wish
 males fr om the community were there? 
 
A. Yes, every Jewish ma le was in there.
 
Q. Do you know if the other Jewish me n had bee n
 set free at the time  you
r father had been set 
free?
 
A. I don™t know.
 
Q. So your father resume d his work. I 
am guessing some where in the mi ddle of 1938?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did anything happen before Kris tallnacht that you can reme mber?
 
A. No, nothing aside from that.
 
Q. So then, tell me  how you reme mb er Kristall
nacht, or how you reme mb er hearing about it. 
What was the first thing you heard about it?
 
A. Well, the fi rst thing I heard about it, is fr om
 my parents™ friends who lived in Hofheim, and 
who had businesses. And we went to visit and we  saw the destruction. I reme mber it so clearly. 
One of the families had a shoe stor e.  
 
Q. These were Jewish families.
 

A. These were all Jewish fa milies. Most of them in Hofheim had businesses. A shoe stor e, a 
furniture store, I think a linen store. They had 
small stores. And I reme mber the shoe store so 
specifically.  Where all the shoe
s were thrown all over the place and boxes, and furniture was 
hacked to pieces and of course the synagogue wa
s totally destroyed. They burned it. I reme mber 

that very clearly. And then we were told that thereason that they didn™t get to us is because they 

were tired out. That was the reason given.
 
Q. And this was the first information you had about it. So basically th
e night that it happened, 
your fa mily was unaware that 
it had happened. Is that right?
 
A. Well we didn™t hear until after it had happene
d. Because it happened the same night all over 
Germany. 
 
Q. Did your parents have siblings?
 
A. Had what?
 
Q. Siblings?
 
A. Yes. My mother- there were six in the famil
y. My father, I am sorry to say, I only know of 
one brother, that I used to vis
it as a child. I don™t know how ma ny 
siblings he had.  If I reme mbe r  
correctly. I don™t know if it was actual true inform
ation or not.  I heard that there were two 
ma rriages and that it was a mi xed fa mily. But I 
don™t really know anythi
ng about it. I don™t know 
anything about them. I don™t know that either.
 
Q. So your mother had quite ma ny siblings?
 
A. Yes, everybody lived in Germany, but 
they all moved away from the town.
 
Q. The only person who rema ined was my moth
er and the eldest daughter who was totally, 
profoundly deaf. She was unmarried, and she lived 
with us.  My mother took care of her. I 
reme mber she had a stroke. It was 1937. Just before
 the trouble started that
 is how I reme mber it 
was 1937. I had gone shopping with my mother and 
she was lying on the fl oor bleeding from her 
mouth and nose. She had had a stroke. My mother 
took care of her until she 
died at home . But all 
the other siblings moved away. One aunt lived in
 Frankfurt, one aunt lived in Bayreuth, one 
uncle lived in Loire and another uncle lived in
 Saarbrucken, and my mo
ther was the only one 
who rema ined in the South. 
 
Q. If I reme mber correctly, your mother was 
born in 1887. Is that right ? And you we re born in 
1930.  

She was 42 when you were born. Is there a reason 
that you we re born that late? Apparently from 
the stories I heard from family, she was marri
ed for about 10 or 15 years, and obviously she 
couldn™t conceive, and they neve
r thought that she could have 
children, so everyone was shocked 
when I was born
 
A. Ok, so there are other fa mily me mbers th
roughout Germany, and then you see what happened 
in the neighboring town during Kristallnacht. Wo ul
d this have been a few days after?  That you 
were in that town?
 

A. No the next day, yes, yes, the very next day. 
 
Q. So how do you reme mber your parents™ reactions, what were they saying?
 
A. We ll, they were very scared, that is when th
ey started proceedings to
 get me  out of Germany.
 
Q. We re they in contact with your mother™s siblings?
 
A. My uncle, my mother™s younger brother, had 
immigrated to the United States from Germany 
in 1936.
 
Q. Do you know why he  decided to do this?
 
A. For the sa me  reason. His wife was a very intelligent woman, and she sa w the writing on the 
wall. They had a very profitable business in the 
Saar territory which was once under French rule, 
and then became  Germa n. And they were very we ll off, and she knew to get out.
 
Q. My other uncle, his children immigrated to Palestine in 1933. And they emigrated in 1935, 
my uncle and his wife.
 
A. My mother made arrangements for my e m
igration to Belgium with the Kindertransport 
through my uncle. My uncle ma de the arrangeme nts 
in the United States with some  organization.
 
Q. Can you tell me  your uncle™s name?
 
A. My uncle™s name  was  Jacob Stern. 
 
Q. And his wife?
 
A. His wife was Helena Stern.
 
Q. And do you know what kind of busi
ness they had in the Saar region?
 
A. They had a clothing departme nt store: ch
ildren™s clothing, me n™s cl
othing, ladies™ clothing.
 
Q. We re they able to find this type of work in the United States in 1936? 
 
A. No, when they got to the United States, my
 uncle bought a chocolate factory, and he worked 
there, and when the war broke out
, it was diffi cult to get sugar a
nd flour, so he sold it. So he 
when he was in his 40s, he learned to be a diam
ond cutter.  And that is the business he was in.
 
Q. Do you know whether your uncle 
and his wife were able to take any assets with them when 
they left?
 
A. Yes they took their money and when they got to the U.S. they invested the money, a nd they 

took their furniture and silver and china and other stuff. Because they got out early enough, in 

1936.
 
Q. So he wa s the one who ma de arrangeme nts for your emigration?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Do you know whether this was your mother™s idea or his idea?
 

A. I am not sure how it came about, but I think  wh
at happened is that my father™s brother, whom 
we were friends with and in  touch with, they ha
d a son who was a year older than I and they also 
had fa mily in New York. And I think that is how
 it actually started. My mother heard it from 
them and contacted my uncle in New York, and then he took care of it.
 
Q. You don™t know the details of it of what he had to do to take care of it?
 
A. There was some  kind of organization, Jewi
sh organization, I really don™t know who. The 
Jewish Committee, I guess. Because they were the 
one who were supposed to take care of us in 
Belgium.
 
Q. Do you know whether he had to pay to get you on a list?
 
A. To pay?  Oh sure, defini
tely there was money involved.
 
Q. Do you know whether your mother 
needed to send any funds with you?
 
A. I don™t know who pa id for it, whether my unclepaid for it, whether my parents paid for it, I 

don™t know those details.
 
Q. Now, how did your mother explain to you 
what was going to happen, or your father?
 
A. Some how I understood, I knew that I had to 
get out. The day that I was dismissed from 
school, I knew that I could not 
stay there, even though I was only 8 years old. And then my 
mother told me  that this was going to happen.
 
Q. How did she tell you, how 
did she explain it to you?  
 
A. Well she just told me that the situation was ge
tting worse, and that I ha
d to leave in order to 
save me  they had to send me  away. That is the on
ly time emotionally that  I 
didn™t even cry. I just 
some how, I just instinctively knew, so me how I s
till reme mber the feeling until this day. I left  on 

the last Kindertranspor
t which was in July, 1939. Wa r broke 
out in September. Of course, the 
borders were closed, and I went to Belgium.
 
A. Where did the Kindertransport leave from?
 
Q. It left from Frankfurt, my aunt lived in Fr
ankfurt, and my mother and I went to Frankfurt.
 
A. So your mother was the person who accompa nied you?
 
Q. So you had to say ﬁgoodbyeﬂ to your father at home?
 
A. Yes at home. And I reme mber he gave me  a 
ring, a little gold ring as a going away gift, and I 
had a chain with a ﬁchaiﬂ me dallion on it and on the 
train to Belgium, the German soldiers came 
around and collected all th
e valuable gold and silver that th
e children were wearing and it was 
summertime  so the window on the train was open a 
bit, so I took off my chain and I took off my 
ring and I threw it out. I did 
not want them to have it. 
 
Q. You wer e  a very headstrong nine year old. That™s amazing.
 
A. Yes.
 

Q. How ma ny children on the train?
 
A. The train was full of 
kids, I don™t know how many.
 
Q. I want to hear about the train but 
before, can you tell me  what you packed?
 
A. My mother packed. I had a va
lise that I carried but then sh
e packed a huge, I don™t even know 
what to call it in English. It was like a basket
, but it was luggage. I don™
t know if you have ever 
seen this, but in those years wh
en people ma de trans-Atlant ic crossings on ships they carried 
these huge trunks ma de out of basket ma terial and 
it had leather straps and it was full of clothes, 
beautiful clothes, and my mother ma de all new dr
esses. In the meanti me  that thing got lost, I 
never got it. So I went well equipped.
 
Q. Did you take clothes for all seasons?  
 
A. For all seasons.
 
Q. Did you take clothes for summer a nd winter?
 
A. Yes, winter coats and sweaters and summer st
uff.  Of cour se, I went in the summer time.
 
Q. What did she say to you about when she would see you again?
 
A. She said she was hoping that we would be re
united, but I don™t know whet
her. What actually 
happened is that my parents could have immi
grated to the United States. My uncle ma de 
umpteen affidavits. But they didn™t believe 
what was happening to them. They could not 
understand. They were citizens of th
at country, they were abiding ci
tizens, they were part of the 
community. And then some one come s along and tells th
em that they are not. And they just could 
not believe it. That is the reason they neve
r got out. And then in 1942, my uncle ma de 
arrangements for them to go to Cuba, but th
ey wouldn™t go because th
e Belgian authorities 
wouldn™t release me , and they wouldn™t go on their own.
 
Q. Do you know what ship they would have gone to Cuba on?  
 
A. I don™t know. All I know was in 1942, before th
ey were deported.  And then one other point 
finally in 1942, when they decided they should ge
t out, and then the embassies closed. There was 
no other way to get to the United States at th
at point.  And so it was just not to be. 
 
Q. So you get to Frankfurt, and you get to the 
train station. Do you reme mber a lot of children?
 
A. Yes lots of children. And I also reme mber 
my mother had made me
 a sandwich, and it was a 
smoked beef sandwich. And I kept rehearsing in my
 head, when I was waiting at the station on 
the train, that if a Germa n soldier came  along a
nd asked me  what I was eating, I would tell him it 
was ham. Because it looked something like ham. 
Yes, of course, the train was full of children.
 
Q. Now I find it amazing that you have these ideas 
and this independent sp
irit. Did your mother 
give you any tips or coaching on how to behave
?  These ideas were comi ng from you yourself?
 
A. No, that is just the way I am. And I am 81 
years old and I am still the same. I don™t listen a 
lot. I™m very emotionally independent. Not 
so mu ch physically, my husband takes very good 

care of me , but I am e motionally independent. I alwa
ys had to be that way. If I weren™t, I would 
have ended up in some  psych ward. Th
at is just a personality trait. 
 
Q. So let™s get back to the train sta
tion. Do you reme mber leaving your mother?
 
A. Yes, I reme mber leaving my mother and not cr
ying, and I cry very easily even to this day and 
that is the only time there was real  drama in
 my life, and I didn™t even shed a tear.
 
Q. What about your mother?
 
A. I don™t reme mber that she cried. I don™t think 
she would have. She was kind of stoic, a stoic 
person. I think.
 
Q. Did she give you any rules to abide by?  Any 
indications of things that you should follow, 
principles, suggestions? 
 
A. Well, I just think she said
 to be a good girl. To listen, to
 follow rules. I don™t reme mber 
anything specific, she was giving advice that 
a mother gives to a child, I would imagine.
 
Q. Do you reme mber if the child
ren around you were rather unruly?
 
A. No
 
Q. They were silent, they were well behaved. 
 
A. Everybody was scared to death. They wouldn™t 
dare do anything. The German soldiers were 
parading up and down the trai
n, throughout the 
whole trip.
 
Q. Where there any adults on the train that were 
coordinating the trip that
 would not have been 
soldiers?
 
A. Yes, certainly there were chaperones, people,
 and adults taking us to where we are going. We  
were going to a specific place, to
 a Je wish home in Brussels.
 
Q. All the children in the trai n station?
 
A. Well I can™t say all th
e children, but a good part.
 
Q. So you knew where you were going?
 
A. Yes, I knew where I was going, and my pare
nts knew where I was going, and my uncle knew 
where I was going.
 
Q. Okay.  So you get on the train and how 
ma ny children are sitting with you in one 
compart ment?
 
A. I don™t know, it was a regular train, I 
don™t know how ma ny ch
ildren were in the 
compart ment. There was some body s itting next to 
me , and there were two people facing me , but 
I couldn™t tell you the number.
 
Q. So did the Germans s ucceed in taking anythi ng from you?  
 

A. No, I had only those two things
, a little ring with a red stone I 
reme mber I had the chain with 
the ﬁchaiﬂ on it.  And I just took them off and th
rew them out, so they didn™t get anything from 
me, because that is all I had. I don™
t reme mber that we had any money. 
 
Q. Do you reme mber how long it took to cross the border?
 
A. No, I don™t reme mber  that either. I reme mber
 we stopped in Aachen, which is a border town 
between Germany and Belgium. I reme mber that 
we stopped there for some  ti me  but I couldn™t 
tell you how long the whole journey took.
 
A. Do you reme mber feeling different
 once you were outside of Ger many?
 
Q. Not really.
 
A. What wa s going on in your mi nd th
roughout this trip? Do you reme mber?
 
Q. Well I was scared, I was going to mi ss my pa re
nts and my life, wondering what life was going 
to be like in this strange–Don™t forget we ha
d to learn a new language. 
We didn™t speak French 
or Flemish. We had to learn French.
 
A. So what was your destination in Belgium?
 
Q. We  were going to Zune(? ). There were two 
Jewish homes, the one for boys and the one for 
girls. The one for girls wa s in Zune(?), which 
was a suburb of Brussels and the boys were going 
to a home in a different part of Brussels.
 
Q. And this was a Jewish organization?
 
A. Yes. And my cousin he went before I went. I 
went on the last transpor
t, and he we nt before. 
And he was in the boys™ home .
 
Q. Do you reme mber his name ?
 
A. His na me  was Gerard Eckmann.
 
Q. And how much older was he?
 
A. He was a year older, and he was an only child also.
 
Q. So you get to Belgium and what happens next?
 
A. Well we get to Belgium and we get taken to this home and we have to settle in dormitories 

(they settled us) and we put 
our luggage and clothes away.
 
Q. How ma ny children were in this home , 
in the room that you were sheltered in?
 
A. I don™t reme mber how many and I don™t re
member how many in the home either.
 
Q. Now all of the children spoke Germa
n, so you could speak among yourselves.
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did any of the adults speak German?
 

A. No, everybody that was there spoke German; th
e adults spoke Germa n 
because they had to 
communicate with us. But then we went to scho
ol right away and we learned French very 
quickly. And then I was only in that Jewish 
home for two months. In September, 1939, they 
transferred me  and a fe w other girls to a non-Je
wish home i n Middelkerke that was on the coast 
in Belgium. Why they did that, I have never been 
sure. They said it was for health reasons. And I 
was fortunate I was there. 
 
Q. This was September 1939?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did you reme mber hearing about the war breaking out?
 
A. I was fortunate I was there because the two Jewish homes, on May 10, 1940 when war was 

declar ed in Belgium, all the Jewish children we
re evacuated to Nice, France and ma ny of them 

did not survive including my cousin. So we were ve
ry fortunate that we were transferred to this 
non-Jewish home , and the Jewish committee who 
was responsible for these children totally 

abandoned us, they just forgot that we  were th
ere and we were very ups
et, because we did not 
want to be there, we wanted to be with the Jewish kids.
 
Q. Of cours e .
 
A. And they totally abandoned us and this hom
e called the Foyer des Orphelins, they took care 
of us. Nobody paid for us, nobody acknowledged our presence, and that™s how I survived.
 
Q. Was it a state institution or a religious inst itution?
 
A. No, It was a private institution 
supported by voluntary cont ributions.
 
Q. Any religious denomination?
 
A. No, everybody was Catholic in Belgium, so of 
course the children we re Catholic.  This was 
an annex of the ma in orphanage which was situated in Molenbeek [I think she is referring to the 
location of the Brussels orphanage], and they ha
d 5 separate campuses. So that at the beginning 
of the war, on May 10, 1940 when they started to 
bomb the sea coast, th
at home  closed on the 
seashore and we were evacuated to Brussels. That 
is where I spent the war year s. I actually spent 
the war years in Brussels in this or phanage.
 
Q. So you were sent by mi stake from the Jewish
 orphanage to the Foyer des Orphelins, but you 
were not the only one, there were 
a couple of other girls with you.
 
A. There were about 10 Jewish kids there.
 
Q. And did the 10 Jewish kids also
 get sent to Brussels with you?
 
A. Yes, everybody got sent to Brussels, and they
 took care of us all t
hose years, without any 
compensation or acknowledgeme nt by the Jewish community that we were even there.
 
Q. Did the institution or  the adults know that you were Jewish?
 

A. Yes, absolutely.
 
Q. This would have been on your paperwork.
 
A. We  couldn™t go to school during the war. 
The older children... At th
e age of 15, everybody in 
Belgium at that time had to carry an identity car
d. And the kids who were older than myself who 
were 15 and more, on their identity card was big a 
red stamp that sa idﬂ Juifﬂ, which is ﬁJewﬂ in 
French and they had to carry that, consequently, they didn™t go out very much, because if they go 
on the street car or are stopped on 
the street, that would be it. 
 
Q. So you and the ten other Jewish children ar
e sent to Brussels in 1940. Is that right?
 
A. 1940, May 10, 1940, when the war broke out in Belgium.
 
Q. Can you describe what life 
was like during that time  wh
at  did you do during the day. You 
couldn™t go to school. What did you do?
 
A. We  went to school until 1942. Fr om 1942-1944, 
the liberation, September 1944 we did not go 
to school. For three years, we did not go to school.
 
Q. In the two years that you went to sc
hool, was this state school you went to?
 
A. A public school.
 
Q. Did the pupils or teacher
s know that you were Jewish?
 
A. I don™t think so. I don™t
 know, I don™t think so.
 
Q. Did you ma ke any fri e nds
 during those two years?
 
A. Oh sure, the kids from the orphanage. We  were all friends.
 
Q. But not the kids at the sc
hool from outside the orphanage?
 
A. No, not the outside kids. There was no opport
unity. We  couldn™t go outside the orphanage and 
meet with friends. We  were pretty much confined to the orphanage. We  c ouldn™t go out on our 

own. 
 
Q. We re you able to pick up French in those two years?
 
A.  I spoke French, I picked up French imme diatel
y. I mean, by that time we were fluent. I forgot 
German by t hat time . You know, children learn languages very quickly.
 
Q. The adults around you then were not speak
ing German to you anymor e. There were no 
chaperones who spoke German.
 
A. Everyone was speaking French.  French or Flemish. The language spoken at the orphanage 

was French. 
 
Q. Did you speak any Flemish?
 
A. No, I never picked
 up that language.
 

Q. So those two years that you spent in school, 
do you reme mber which grades they were, which 
classes you were in, which grade?
 
A. I was nine, I guess four and five.
 
Q. O.k. so you go to school for two years, 
you don™t get to go out much. Do you remember 
anything else about that time?
 
A. I reme mb er that it was actually a happy time. 
We were treated extremely well, we were taken 
care of, we had shelter, we had clothes, we had 
food, and we did not suffer the sense that a lot of 
other people suffered.
 
Q. We re you aware of other people suffering?
 
A. There were shortages of food. People had pr
oblems  buying food. Certainly we were aware. It 
was war time.
 
Q. We re there any shortages at the orphana
ge?  Were there foods that you didn™t get?
 
A. No, the food wasn™t plentiful, but it was cer
tainly enough, we didn™t starve. During the war 
we ate mostly potatoes, and carrots and rutabaga 
and those root vegetables. We  had very little 
meat, or eggs, some  kids got eggs if they were
 needy me dically. We  had milk that turned sour 
most of the time  because there was no refrig
eration. We  had bread. I don™t know how really on 
earth we even ate it. They were not allowed to 
bake white bread, not that
 white bread is good for 
you. It had to be bread baked with I don™t know 
what kind of flour, but I reme mber when you 

broke it , there would be string
s, and we did not have butter, 
we had this God awful ma rgarine 
stuff, and so also there we re mi ce so there would 
be holes in the bread. But we never starved so it 
wasn™t the problem.
 
Q. How ma ny children were
 at this orphanage?
 
A. 60.
 
Q. Did you get to know most of them?
 
A. Yes, we knew all of them. The ages ranged 
from about 2-18, once they turned 18 they had to 
move to another facility.
 
Q. We re there other war refugees such as yourse
lf and the other Jewish children, or were these 
mostly children whose parents had 
either abandoned them or died?
 
A. No, either parents had died. My best friend, he
r mother had died and her father was recruited 
into the army. So he placed hi
s children into this 
orphanage. And they rema ined there for the 
duration of the war. The others most of them were really orphan childre
n, the parents had died, 
one parent or two parents. To my
 knowledge, they were not abandoned.
 
Q. After you left Germany were you ab
le to correspond with your parents?
 
A. I was able to correspond with my  parents 
until 1942. April 1942 was the last letter I received 
from my mother. Initshe told 
me  that they had to leave. Wh ere to she didn™t know. And that 

was it then I found out from myself from a woma
n who was the librarian in the high school in 
the neighboring town, the daughter 
of a Lutheran mi nister, who t
ook it upon herself to assemble 
a history of the Jews of that whole area. I find 
out through her that my parents were gassed in a 
truck in Poland some where. Accordin
g to her, they didn™t even get 
to a camp. That is how I went 
back to Germany actually, it was through her. Sh
e had incredible informa tion that she had 
amassed. She had done this all on her own. She had e
xhibits in the different town. She wanted to 
educate young people and to remi nd old people of 
what happened. And that is how I originally 
got back to Germany. She had placed an ad in 
the Afbau, which is a German ne wspaper in New 
York, and she was looking for me . And my cousin™s
 aunt saw the ad, gave it to my uncle, who 
forwarded it to me , and I wrote to her, no my 
uncle had already passed away, my cousin™s aunt 
forwarded it to my cousin and my cousin forwar
ded it to me here , and I wrote to her and that 
year my hus band and I were going to Israel, my
 husband is a dentist and there was a dental 
convention there  and we went to
 Israel and her name  is Kordul
a Kapner, and we me t Kordula in 
Ber Sheva, and she told us about what she doe
s, and invited me  to come  and be a keynote 
speaker at one of her exhibits
 that October or November I 
forget exactly when, and I was 
working at the time, and I got a week off, and I we
nt to Germany and I spoke  at her exhibit. And 
that is when I found out a lot of stuff, and sh
e gave me  a lot of infor mation and she has an 
incredible amount of information about that whol
e era, she has lists, deportation lists, it is 
unbelievable what she has amassed. And then subse
quently I went again. She had another exhibit 
in my town i n my school, where I went to school,
 and I went again and I spoke there, and I me t 
lots of people, younger people, older people, 
a lot of the older pe
ople were gone already 
naturally, and I am still in touch with a couple, th
ey are both physicians, and they just erected a 
me morial stone to all the Jews of the town from the 20
th
 century. I am just in correspondence 
now via ema il, and so I learned a lot from her.
 And we are still in touch. Though not as often.  
And then I went back to Germany a gain and 
I took my daughter and my grandson. We just 
visited. I just wanted them to see where 
I came fr om and learn something first hand.
 
Q. Sure. Now you said you were able to correspond with your parents from 1939-1942, was 

there a sense in thei r letter s that
 the situation was deteri orating.
 
A. Yes, absolutely. 
 
Q. So they were quite open about it?
 
A. My mother said that they took away her sewi
ng machine so she couldn™t work anymore. They 
had put them in a poorhouse; they took away a
ll their possessions. They
 confiscated their land. 
My father couldn™t work and then the last one 
was that they were going, but they didn™t know 
where they were going. Yes, I thought 
definitely that it 
was deteriorating.
 
Q. So in this time were you able 
to correspond with Jacob, your uncle?
 
A. No I couldn™t correspond with the Unite
d States. There was no correspondence between 
Europe and the United States. There was no corre
spondence with anybody af
ter my parents were 
gone.  There was no correspondence between the Un
ited States and Europe at this time or 
Europe and Palestine at the time. My other half 
of the family was in Palestine. Not that  I was 
close to them as I was with my unc le in New York.
 

Q. What wa s your cousin™s name ?  Was it Gerhardt?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. We re you able to connect w
ith him during that first year?
 
A. No, I never connected with him. We were not
 in touch with the boys™ home . Then I was away 
fr om Brussels, I went to the coast, so th
ere was no way to be in touch with him.
 
Q. When di d you go to the coast?
 
A. In September, 1939
 
Q. I thought you had left Brussels a second time, 
because you were in Brussels during the war. 
Right?
 
A. We ll I first went to Br ussels, and then from Br
ussels I went to the co
ast, and then fr om the 
coast I went  back to Brussels.
 
Q. So you are in school from 1940-1942, so who ma
kes the decision that you can™t go to school 
anymore, who tells you?
 
A. We ll the Germans de creed that Jews couldn™t go 
to school. So the authorities of the orphanage 
abide by those rules and told us th
at we couldn™t go to school anymore.
 
Q. So how do your days look, in 1942 w
ithout school?  How do you keep yourself busy?  
 
A. We  spent most of our days pasting ration 
stamps. You can™t imagine how ma ny ration stamps. 
There were 4 or 5 homes with 60 kids in each ho me
. That™s a lot of kids, 
that™s a lot of ration 
stamps. That is what we did. We  
sat there all day pasting stamps.
 
Q. So I a m not familiar with the ration stam
ps, what did have to you paste the stamps on?
 
A. They had these huge books, where you had to pa
ste the ration stamps, I suppose they had to 
present them to buy food and that 
is what you pasted the stamps 
on. That took days and days.  I 
mean we didn™t do it all day, we had to clea
n, keep the home clean, between the cleaning, the 
cooking. No the cooking was central, but we ha
d to do the dishes. We  kept busy. And sewing, 
we had to do me nding. In those days you didn™t 
throw things out, you me nded them. A lot of 
me nding for  60 kids. We  had to take care of th
e youngest children.  
I guess you could call it 
babysit. We  kept busy, we were not bored. 
 
Q. And the non-Jewish children were still going to school?
 
A. Yes. Everyone was still going to sc hool.
 
Q. Wa s there any hostility from th
e non-Jewish children at this time?
 
A. No there was no hostility, no open hostility. But 
later I found out, muc h la
ter on that some  of 
the girls were angry because they treated us bette
r than they treated their own, the Belgian kids.
 
Q. In which way was this visible?
 

A. They took us out, they took us to a movie occasionally, and some ti me s they took us to visit 
their own fa milies.  They just showed fa vor.  
 
Q. Why do you think this was?
 
A. I don™t know, I guess they liked us better
. (Laughing) Later on, I didn™t know when I was 
there, but later my friend, who I was very close 
to, she told me, because I went back to Belgium 
when we had reunions. She told me  that this is wh
at they said, they were very resentful of the 
fact that they fe lt that  we were tr
eated better.  And in fact we were. 
 
Q. And the adults never told you why they were treating you differently?
 
A. I don™t know, ma ybe  they felt sorry for us. 
 
Q. And there was absolutely no hostility on the part of the adults?
 
A. No. None , whatsoever. We ll, I shouldn™t say 
that. There was no actual 
hostility, but the staff 
at the home at the seashore; they we
ren™t particularly fond of the Jews. 
 
Q. How was this known?
 
A. We ll, I guess their attitude that also came out la
ter. We  were too young to sort of be aware of 
that. That sort of came out when were olde
r and understood more of wha t  was going on. And 
those were good times, I hated it there, I was under
 a lot of stress, I became physically ill, I used 
to throw up all the time and they 
used to ma ke me eat the vomit.
 
Q. Oh my God, really?
 
A. And they used to humiliate the ki ds, not just me . When they kids wet their beds, they would 

parade them out and put their bed sheets on th
eir heads. They were very mean. Those two 
ma trons, whatever you want to call them, they we
re extremely mean people. They were almost 
like sadists.  But we didn™t have that
 experience once we got to Brussels. 
 
Q. How much time did you spend 
on the shore, how ma ny months?
 
A. From Se ptember to May. How ma ny months is that 5, 7 months?
 
Q. Too ma ny.
 
A.  And we hated it. Every day of it. We hated 
the Jewish committee for leaving us there. Every 
day we planned to run away. Except we didn™t know where to run.
 
Q. And you don™t know why they sent you there?
 
A. I don™t know. Supposedly for health reas
ons are what they 
said, but I don™t know.
 
Q. You have no me mory of being sick.
 
A. No I wasn™t sick. I wa s small, but I was alwa
ys small. I am still small today. I can™t see any 
logical reason to be honest with you that I could 
see today.  It was just 
luck. Had we not been 
there, I wouldn™t be here today.
 

Q. So let™s go back to 1942, you™re all keep
ing busy. By the way, the other children, the non-
Jewish children who still get to
 go to school: did they have to 
do chores similar to you, all the 
sewing and cleaning that you all had to do?
 
A. We ll yes to a certain point. Of course they we
ren™t there so they didn™t have to do as much. 
But sewing for sure.  There was a sewi ng sessi
on every week, we all sat around a table and had 
to me nd the clothes. That was a jo
int effort, that wasn™t just  us.
 
Q. What kind of holidays did you observe?
 
A. Holidays, you mean Jewish holidays?
 
Q. Did you observe Jewi sh holidays?
 
A. No, we never knew when they were. We  observed Christian holidays.
 
Q. So you wouldn™t have done anything to observe the Sabbath?
 
A. No
 
Q. And you weren™t keeping Kosher?
 
A. No, certainly not.
 
Q. And was that a conscious deci
sion, or was it 
just practical?
 
A. No, well there was no opportunity. That was not
 in their schedule. (L
aughing) The kids went 
to school, we nt to church on Sundays, and there wa
s no opportunity for that at all. Don™t forget, 
Jews didn™t live openly in 
Brussels at that time, mo
st of them were hidden.
 
Q. Sure. But you were not hidden, you were in this orphanage.
 
A. We ll, we were hidden in a way.
 
Q. In which way?
 
A. In the way that they didn™t 
advertise that we were there.
 
Q. I™m sorry?
 
A. They didn™t openly advertise that we were ther
e. They didn™t go to the authorities and say we 
hadﬂ xﬂ number of Jewish kids here.
 
Q. But the other children who were non-Jewish kn
ew that you were Jews and so it wasn™t a 
secret, and you weren™t hidden in a baseme nt or attic.
 
A. No, nothing like that. However, from what 
I understand ,although I don™t have concrete proof 
that, the authorities, there were some  inquiries
, actually, the Germans  came to the home a couple 
of time but they didn™t some how bother us. And they
 were also stationed 
a couple of blocks for 
where we were and they would 
go back and forth all the time.
 
A. Stationed. Wa s it a garrison or a police station?  
 

Q.  No, it was built as was a home fo r the aged, and they took it over and turned it into a military 
hospital. So they were going back and forth 
all the time. From what
 I understand, although as I 
have said, I don™t have concrete
 proof the authorities did have some  problems and they did 
protect us. How I don™t know, but the fact is th
at we survived and we were never bothered. 
 
Q. We re you in any way required to go to
 church, to any Christian services?
 
A. No. If you wanted to you c
ould go, we were never forced. 
 
Q. Do you reme mber being aware of Nazi for
ces occupying Be lgium?  Do you recall starting to 
see Nazi officers on the st reet?
 
A. Oh sure, they were everywhere. Oh yes.
 
Q. What wa s going through your mi nd when you saw them?
 
A. We  really did not know what was going on. We
 weren™t aware of the camps until much later, 
At first they didn™t round up the Jews, that
 di dn™t come  until 1942-1943, and then we were 
aware, especially the older children, they did not
 go out unnecessarily, they 
did not  go out on the 
streetcars, which is where they rounded up the people.
 
Q. So what ma de you be come  aware, was it your
 mi nders, chaperones who gave you instructions 
or how did you become  a ware that it was dangerous?  
 
A. Yes, they told us. They didn™t keep it a s
ecret. As a ma tter of fact
 there was one young girl, 
she was older than we were. She lived in Belg
ium. She wasn™t a native Belgian, she was fr om 
some where in Eastern Europe, and her parents pl
aced her in the orphanage, under the guise of 
Christian, and they rent ed an apartment across the 
street from the orphanage, so that they could 
keep an eye on her. And so on her way to school
, she could stop by to visit them, and a friend 
and myself happened to be by the window when 
the Germans came and threw their furniture out 
the window, and took them a way.  We didn™t know
 that she was Jewish. We  suspected she was 
Jewish but we didn™t really know, because she we
nt to school and she acted as a Christian.
 
Q. What ma de you suspect
 that she was Jewish?
 
A. She looked it. She had very Semitic features
. And we were suspicious from the beginning 
because it didn™t look normal somehow. She wasn™t 
like the rest of us, and she was an extremely 

bright young girl, she was a geni
us. She was going to one of the top schools there. And so of 
course at that point, we knew. And they were ta
ken to the place where they took the Jews, before 
they were taken to Germany, a town called Maline
s. And this happened shortly before liberation. 
They took them on the train, her mother hanged hersel
f, and the father survived. So then she left 
the orphanage, and went back to the fa mily. That
 was the only incident that a Jewish child was 
actually hidden. People were not sup
posed to know that she wa s Jewish.
 
Q. So her parents were taken away in plain si
ght of the people at the 
orphanage. Did she start 
acting differently?  How did she react?
 
A. Not really, she continued going to school, I gu
ess she didn™t really, she was I guess she was 
hoping that no one would know. It must have been
 late 1943 or early 1944, 
because shortly after 

that we were liberated in September 1944, so shor
tly after that, so she wasn™t actually in the 
home  for that long. No, she just continued. And th
en after the liberation, when her father came  
back, she went back to him. After that, I don™
t know what happened.  She never became friends 
with us, she really kept to herself.
 
Q. And so I am supposing this was an all-girl environment?
 
A. The home?  No. 
 
Q. There were boys too?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. So how were the boys and girls separated?
 
A. Just different dormitories, not in the dining 
room or playing.  We were mi xed together. The 
sleeping arrangeme nts were different. They 
had boy dormitories and girl dormitories.
 
Q. So were there any romances at this time? 
 
A. No, because when the kids turned 18, they went to anot he r facility.
 
Q. But I am supposing the boys and girls mi ght ha
ve fancied each other 
before the age of 18?
 
A. No, I don™t think so.
 
Q. Okay. So we were talking about how things
 changed in 1942. Do you recall if there were 
different phases as you get into 1943-1944, or on
ce you were out of school it was basically the 
same daily routine until the end of the war.
 
A. Yes, it was fairly the same. 
 
Q. So nothing deteriorated
 at the end of the war?
 
A. No.
 
Q. There was no hiding at any time ?
 
A. We ll, there was no hiding in the sense that we liv
ed in an attic or a ba
seme nt but certainly our 
move me nt was restricted. You couldn™t go wherev
er you felt like going. I had more fl exibility 
because I was blonde and blue eyed, and I was sm
all and because I was under 15 so I didn™t have 
to carry an identity card. But the olde r girls,
 the older people, and ch
ildren they were more 
restricted, could not go out, they
 could not go out on the street 
car, and we had to wear the 
Jewish star for a while.
 
Q. Yourself included?
 
A. Yes, all the Jewish kids. Until they realized
 what it was for, and then they took it off.
 
Q. How did they realize what it was for?
 
A. Because that is how they herded up all the Jews.
 

Q. How long did it take before you were required to
 put it on and when they realized what it was 
for?
 
A. It didn™t take very long.
 
Q. Do you recall having it on your clothes?
 
A. I reme mb er sewing it on myself.
 
Q. How did you feel about sewing it on?
 
A. At that time we didn™t think so much about it
 but once we realized what it me ant, we didn™t 
feel so comf ortabl e with it. I am sorry to this da
y that I threw it out, I am sorry that I didn™t keep 
it. 
 
Q. Do you reme mber being out
 on the street
 with it on?
 
A. Yes, because we used to go on long walks every weekend. Because it was sewn on our outer 
garment. I also reme mbe r  sort of hiding it as much as I could.
 
Q. So that means that you were
 aware that it was not a good thing?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. We re you getting into trouble?  Were you being 
harassed verbally or given any looks out on 
the street, any violence?
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Nothing at all?
 
A. Not personally . Nobody knew that I was Jewis
h, aside from the star, as I said we didn™t 
wear it for ve ry long. I don™t have Semitic features. When I was a young child, I was bl onde, I 

had long braids, I have blue eyes. I looked 
like everybody else. So why couldn™t I be like 
everybody else?  I never had any problems , no.
 
Q. So the phase when you had to wear the 
star was very short, was it a few months?
 
A. No, it was a couple of weeks. It wa s very sh
or t, because once they realized what was going 
on, they told us to take it off.
 
Q. Who was ﬁtheyﬂ, the people who we
re in charge of the orphanage?
 
A. Because they were very protective
 of us, they really and trul y were.
 
Q. Do you reme mber anybody™s name  who wor ked there?
 
A. The head of my home , we used to call themﬁTanteﬂ, aunt .  The head of my home  was Tante 

Denise, 
Vandenbroucke 
was her last name . And she was tota
lly devoted to the children and 
totally devoted to us particularly, it wa s strange, 
but that was the fact. And when I went back to 
Belgium, on several occasions when she was aliv
e, and I used to correspond with her regularly. 
One was name d Lucianne and, Gabriella, some thi
ng, I forget, there were three, no four.  The 

children were divided according to
 age, there were three age groups
 and each one took care of a 
group and one was in charge of the boys, and each one had different responsibilities, and Tante 
Denise was the head of the staff, and she was a wonderful, wonderful woma n. 
 
Q. And I think I mi ght have asked you this  
you, regarding orphanage on the shore, this 
orphanage in Brussels these wome n were civil serv
ants , their salaries we re paid by  donations,  
how did the survive?  
 
A. Whoever supported this institu
tion, that is who paid their sa
laries.  This was a very big 
enterprise; they had a board of directors.  
The Foyer des Orphelins was a very well-known 
institution, they mi ght have had some st
ate funding, but they al
so received voluntary 
contributions because they had functions to rais
e funds. But where they got
 all their money from, 
I couldn™t tell you. 
 
Q. And the institution wa s called what?
 
A. Foyer des Orphelins.
 
Q. 1944, do you reme mb er of anything 
of consequence before liberation?
 
A. We ll no, life was pretty much the same  until September 4, 1944 when the Brits came in and 

we went down and we watched them. And th
at was a change  of life that very day.
 
Q. Did you hear anything a
bout D-Day during the summer?
 
A. Oh yes, the head mi stress had a radio, and 
we weren™t allowed to listen to the BBC, but 

some how she ma naged to get that frequency, and we
 used to listen to it. And the big scare came 
during The Battle of The Bulge, we were sure 
the Germans were comi ng back.  So we were 
totally aware of what was happening.
 
Q. And this radio was in English or French?
 
A. No, in French.
 
Q. And who would listen to it? 
 
A. We used to sitaround 
and listen to it.  A group of us, and sh
e would invite some  of us to listen 
in her room, Tante Denise. We  used to sit around and listen to it in her room.  
 
Q. Did you know that you were not supposed to do this?
 
A. Yes, she told us. 
 
Q. She told you not to talk about it. But it is inte
resting that she trusted you not to talk about it.
 
A. She was a very rema rkable person; she was 
really an exceptional human being. We knew we 
were all in this together. We  were
 totally aware of what was happening. 
 
Q. The other children who were listening to this we re Jewish or was it a mi x?
 

A. It was a mi x; it was the older 
children, not the little ones. She c
hose who could listen to it or 
who couldn™t. Not the whole clan was there. Sh
e had her favorites, there was no question about 
that. 
 
Q. So did you hear about D-Day as it 
was happening or right after it happened?
 
A. I don™t know how many days afte
r we heard. We  just heard that the Allies had landed on the 
French coast.
 
Q. Wa s there a sensation that some thing was goi
ng to be different?  Wa s there hopes we re there 
fears?
 
A. There was always hope that the war would e
nd and the allies would win, but it wa s never sure 
until it actually happened.
 
Q. How ope nly did the older children and st
aff talks about it with the children?
 
A. It was a frequent topic of 
conversation that is what was ha
ppening during those years, that 
was the news, so to speak. I mean you didn™t ha
ve a 24 hour news cycle 
that we have now, but 
we certainly knew what was going on.
 
Q. So you said that you were listening intently 
during the Battle of the Bulge. What happened 
after that?
 
A. The allies drove the Germans back. My husba nd wa
s in the Battle of the Bulge. I think it was 
December 1943. (Asks Burt Œhusband ﬁ When was th
e Battle of the Bulge?ﬂ) Oh yeah it was 
December 1944, Christma s Day, 1944.
 
Q. So how does the war end for you?
 What is the series of events?
 
A. We were already liberated.  
We  were liberated in Septembe
r. We were scared that the 
Germans we re comi ng back, but the Allies dr ove them back. The war ende d in May 1945.
 
Q. How did you know that you we
re liberated by the British?
 
A. We  saw t hem, we we nt out on th
e street, we saw them comi ng in.
 
Q. We re you let out on the street?
 
A. Yes, we went to the ma in avenue wher
e they came in, everybody was lining up. The people 
took us there. It was very exciting.
 
Q. How do you reme mb er that day?
 
A. It was jubilant. It was unbelievable. Then th
ings progressed from there, we went back to 
school and life nor ma lized. And the war ended. Then
 a very close friend of mi ne, her father had 
immi grated to the United States in 1940, and he
 was the only one, they could only get one visa. 
She heads a me ntally handicapped brother, and 
her and her brother went to Belgium a nd her 
mother went to Auschwitz and survived.  Ihappened to be outside 
one day and into the 
orphanage, through the gates walks this woma n. My
 friend™s name  was Hilda Strauss. And she 

asked me in German where she could find her 
daughter Hilda Strauss. Some how I understood it, 
and she was not in the same  building that I was 
in.  I took her over ther
e, and it was the most 
incredible reunion between mother and daught
er. And her wrist had obviously been broken, 
because the bone stuck out and the ha nd was downwar
d. She told us she was hit on the wrist with 
the butt of a rifle: obviously the wrist was never set. She survived. Then she joined her husband 

and they lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and th
en Hilda joined them. But that was really the 
fi rst remarkable thing after the war.
 
Q. When wa s that?
 
A. The war ended in May, so it was s
hortly after, ma ybe June or July.
 
Q. Did Hilda™s mother talk about what had happened
 to her, aside from the 
rifle butt, did she talk 
about how it happened?
 
A. No, because that was the only contact that I ha d w
ith her. She left for the states right after that 
Hilda didn™t go to the states in February 1946, I 
left in April, 1946, Hilda left in February 1946, 
but her mother went before. So that was 
the only contact that
 I had with her. 
 
Q. So during this time , were the orphanage auth
orities trying to find out
 whether your parents 
were still alive? 
 
A. We ll, the Jewish kids all went back. Anothe
r friend of mi ne her mother had immi gr ated to 
England, to London.  Her brother had been in the 
boy™s home, and had been sent to the Nice and 
put on a train to a concentration camp, and jump ed 
off that train and tried to join the Maquis, 
which was the underground in France.  When they
 found out he was 15 years old, they threw him 
out , so he joined the Foreign Legion, and he sp
ent the war years in what is now Vietnam, in 
Indo-China. And after the war he 
came  back, he went to join hi
s mother in England, and so did 
his sister, they were twins, and there were a coup
le of boys, they were also twins, their mother 
was in Scotland, and they went to join their mother
 in Scotland. Hilda went 
to join her parents in 
Bridgeport, Conn. and I went to my uncle in New York.
 
Q. When di d you get to the United St ates?
 
A. April, 1946.
 
Q. When di d you arrive in New York?
 
A. April 29, 1946
 
Q. So you were about 16?
 
A. No, 15. 
 
Q. What we re your first impr
essions of New York City?  
 
A. I was really looking forward to it, we had seen 
all the pictures  and the skyscrapers, and I was 

one of the first ones to go. And I came over on th
e freighter. The voyage took two weeks, it was 
horribl e.  And the ship docked in Br ooklyn-a real
 slummy place. And my first question in my 
broken German was, ﬁWhere are the skyscrapers?  
This is not what I expected.ﬂ However I was 

very impressed when we came into the harbor and 
I saw the Statue of Liberty, I was sick for two 
weeks, it was a very rough voyage and I had a ve
ry difficult time because my aunt and myself, 
we did not get along, and so it was very difficult. 
And my older cousin had 
just been discharged 
from the army the day before I arrived, so there wa
s such turmoil in that fa mily, and I felt that I 
did not fit in. And my younger c
ousin, the older cousin™s brothe
r, who was a senior in high 
school, he wa s a rebellious kid, and he had problem
s in school, and so there were problems with 
that. And it was a two bedroom apartment. So 
I had to sleep in the living room on the couch. 
 
Q. Where was this in New York?
 
A. It was in Washington Height
s. The population at that time  
was almost 100% Jewish-Germa n. 
It was very uncomfortable, and I 
didn™t like it, and I was very
 unhappy. I went to school right 
away. They put me  in junior high school in grade 
eight. Of course, I didn™t
 speak English, and in 
those days they didn™t have E.S.L 
classes, like they do today. And 
so they just stuck you there, 
and you either learned or you didn™t.
 
Q. Now were there other German
-Jewish kids in that class?
 
A. No, not recent immi grants.  Of course ther
e were. Because it was in Washington Heights, 
most of the population was from
 a Jewish-German background.
 
Q. We re they bilingual?
 
A. Of cours e  they were, but I couldn™t speak 
German, I just spoke French. I could understand 
German but I could not converse in Ge rman. A
nd that was the first year. During the summer, 
some how my aunt ma naged to get me  a babysitti
ng job. I was 16.   So, I was taking care of an 
infant. To this day I am wondering how this wo
ma n trusted this baby to me , what did I know 
about babies?  So I wasn™t very happy with that. Th
en in the Fall I went back
 to school, I went to 
high school.
 
Q. How long did it take you to learn to speak English?
 
A. I learned English very quickl
y, because it is so isolating, y
ou can™t talk to anybody. I would 
say I learned to speak English in three months. Th
en I went to high school for a year. Then when 
I was 17 my  uncle said to me  ﬁYou have to go to 
work,ﬂ so I went to work, and I finished high 
school at night.
 
Q. What kind of job did you have?
 
A. My first job was babysitting, and then I worked
 in Mount Sinai hospital dealing with me dical 
records.
 
Q. So that was an admi nistrative position?
 
A. Yes. We l l  you know, way down on the labor 
scale. I was a clerk. 
I wasn™t trained for 
anything. After I fini shed high school, I went 
to secretarial school, and I became a me dical 
secretary.
 
Q. So that was your choice?
 

A. Yes. I worked in the hospital-that is what I wa
s fa miliar with I and liked it ,and so that is what  
I did until I got ma rried, even afte
r I got married, and I worked in
 a doctor™s office until I had a 
child.
 
Q. Now in these imme diate post-war years, what 
kind of effor t s did your fa mily ma ke to track 
down your parents and the 
rest of your fa mily?
 
A. Not really, nobody made any effort. I rea
lly didn™t know anything until I me t Kordula.
 
Q. What year was that?
 
A. In 1987.
 
Q. Was there an immedi ate assu
mption they had not survived?
 
A. Yes, we knew that, that much we  kne
w. I don™t know how we knew, but we knew it.
 
Q. When di d you first start hearing about what
 happened in Jewish communities in Europe?
 
A. What happened in Germany?
 
Q. Or in the rest of Europe, th
at the destruction was systematic.
 
A. We  heard that when we were in Belgium 
towards the end, once they started really rounding 
up the Jews in 1942-1943.
 
Q. Wa s there any knowledge of camps?  
 
A. What they said is that is that  they were take
n to labor camps, it was never said that they were 
extermination camps.
 
Q. When di d you first learn that 
they were extermination camps?
 
A. We fi rst learnedthat after 
the war, when Hilda™s mother came. By then for sure we knew 
what had happened. Before we ma y have susp
ected what was going on, because people came 
back and started telling us about what had happened. 
 
Q. So already by 1945-1946, you had heard what happened?
 
A. For sure.
 
Q. So, let™s jump back to New York. Did you ha
ve any social relations
hips with any other 
refugees?
 
A. Yes I did. I didn™t me et anybody when I was in
 school during the day.  But when I went to 
evening school, I did, because everybody was in 
the same  situation. When you were 17 or 18 you 
had to work to survive. I didn™t ha ve to, b
ecause I lived with my 
uncle, but the other young 
wome n and me n had to work to help support th
e fa mily. Whe n you are a refugee you have to 
work to survive, you didn™t come  with anything 
except the clothes on your back. At that point we 
were all working and going to school at night, 
I developed a good network of friends. Then we 
joined the Jewish organizations.
 

Q. We re they Zionist organizations?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Which one did you join?
 
A. ﬁHabi ma? ﬂ I don™t even reme mbe r . I wasn™t ve
ry keen on it, I was never good at that kind of 
stuff, and I wasn™t good at organizations. I™m still not good at it.
 
Q. But you weren™t very keen on it.
 
A. I went for the social aspect, but I never real
ly liked or ganization becau
se of the politics, and I 
don™t like it. To this day I 
don™t like it, and I am not i
nvolved in any organizations.
 
Q. So the idea of Palestine or la
ter Israel never 
appealed to you?
 
A. No. I a m certainly pro- Israel, and I have a 
lot of fa mily there, but
 I never called myself a 
Zionist because I did not wa
nt to live in Israel.
 
Q. Did you want to live in the United States?
 
A. Yes, definitely, that 
was where I wanted to live.
 
Q. And how did you me et your husband?
 
A. I was working in the Bronx Hospital as a me dical
 secretary and he came
 for an interview as 
an intern ther e, and that is
 how we met, in the library. 
 
Q. What year was that?
 
A. 1950.
 
Q. When di d you get married?
 
A. 1951.
 
Q. Did you ever decide to go back and keep any Je
wish holidays or religious
 aspects or was that 
was just a thing of the past?
 
A. That was a thing of past. I kept the Jewish 
holidays, nominally, but wa
s never really seriously 
into it. My husband didn™t come  from a religious
 fa mily. His grandfather was religious, but his 
parents weren™t.  And my  fa mily wasn™t relig
ious, my fa mily in New York.  I knew I never 
would go back to it.
 
Q. When di d you first visit Europe again?
 
A. 1987.
 
Q. So you hadn™t gone back even to Belgium before 1987?
 
A. I am just trying to think when I we
nt back for the fi rst time to Belgium.
 

Q. It must have been before 1987. It must have 
been the late 1970s. I went to Israel in 1975, the 
first time  I took my son, and I think I went to Eur
ope, to Belgium a couple 
of years later. I think 
it was the late 1970s. I have pictures downstairs, 
I can refer to them. That was the first time I 
went back to Belgium. I didn™t go back to Germany until 1987.
 
Q. Had you been in contact with anyone from the orphanage?
 
A. Now?
 
Q. From the ‚40s until the ‚70s.
 
A. I was in touch with everybody. I was in touch 
with Tante Denise, I was in touch with my 
friend Mariette, and I was in touch with the Jewish kids. 
 
Q. And all the correspondence was in French,
 
A. The correspondence was in French.
 
Q. So you never lost your French?
 
A. For sure, I am not fluent anymore, but at 
that time  I was fl uent, 
for t he fi rst  few years.
 
Q. Did you get to see them in to Belgium during the late 1970s?
 
A. Yes, we used to have reunions, then in th
e late 1970s. And then my fr iend Mariette, she came 
here. And she came here to Canada to visit me , and I went back quite a few times.
 
Q. What did it feel like to 
go to Germany, to your town?
 
A. We ll. Very interesting. Everybody. I shouldn™
t say everybody–.Most people chided me  for 
going back. My husband said, ﬁHow can you go b
ack? ﬂ  He would never set foot in Germany. 
And my friends and everybody. So I 
didn™t have any support. But, I felt I had to go back. I had to 
show them t hat they didn™t kill everybody, that I 
survived. And that I was there to represent the 
people who didn™t survive. So I felt very good about it,
 
Q. So did you see anybody that you reme mbered in Germany from your childhood?
 
A. Yes, I did reme mber them. I didn™t remember
 the names exactly, but I reme mbered some of 
the people.
 
Q. Did you meet the m again in ™87?
 
A. Oh yes. The gentiles. The Jews were all gone.
 Sure, I me t classmates, kids I went to school 
with.
 
Q. What was that like?
 
A. Well it was very interesting in
 that...I took a lot of pictures
 and brought them back and my 
friends said, ﬁThey all look worse than you do.ﬂ It 
was very nice to see them. They were all very 
friendly and hospitable. It was very
 ni ce to see them. I really had 
no ill feelings. When I gave the 
talk to the town, I said,ﬂ U
nder the circumstances, I don™t know 
what I would have done. Would 

I have saved people, would I have harbored so
me one, would I have put my life in danger for 
some body else?  I don™t know.ﬂ I felt it was ve
ry therapeutic. And it 
was just a positive 
experience for me. So I didn™t put any blame. So 
I went with open feelings, and I was willing to 
listen to people. And it was therapeutic in a sense.
 
Q. What changed because of that experience? 
 
A. I felt that there was so me  closure; I was able
 to go back and to face the people and in a way 
confront them, and the fact th
at they were very responsive.
 And it was a just a positive 
experience, it was not a negative experience for 
me, and people ma y not u
nderstand that, but that 
is the way I felt. 
 
Q. Now is there anything that we haven™t t
ouched upon or talked about that you would still 
would like to me ntion?  That you thi
nk is important that we left out?
 
A. Well the one thing that I woul
d like to me ntion is that neith
er one of my children married 
Jewish partne rs, and that in one generation, it is
 all gone, and that is ki nd of upsetting, and it not 
that we objected to them ma rrying their ma tes 
or whatever...But it is 
sad that in just one 
generation it is all gone, and my son who went to Israel, who worked in my fa mily™s kibbutz for 

10 years every  Summer, that is 
what he did and yet it didn™t do
 anything. And that saddens me . 
Otherwise, I have been very fortunate, both my 
husband and I are healthy, both my children and 
grandchildren, and great-grandchi
ldren are well, both my children are doctors and doing well in 
their profession.  But there is no sense of Jewishne
ss. When t hey celebrate their ma tes™ holidays, 
when they celebrate Chri stmas and whatever el se. But my son is in touch with the family in 

Israel, and he has strong feelingsfor Israel. But not for Jewish lif
e or Jewi sh people in general. 
 
Q. It is very touching and 
also very curious to me  
that this is how you feel.
 
A. In a sense we were responsible?
 
Q. Can you elaborate on that?
 
A. Because we didn™t instill Jewish life in our
 children. Because we didn™
t practice it ourselves.
 
Q. And that was a conscious decision on your part.
 
A. And that was a conscious decision; I just didn
™t know the outcome at that time . I don™t think I 
would have done it anyhow. It just wa sn™t in me  
either and certainly not in my husband. So, in a 
way, we are certainly responsible. We  never insisted
 that they date Jewish people, well they did 
join Jewish organizations, but that didn™t work
 out for them. And that™s, you know, pretty much 
it.
 
Q. Leni, I™d like to thank you for this amazing oppor
tunity to listen to your life story. I am going 
to stop the recording right now,
 
A. You know this is my daughter
™s doing, that she contacted you. 
 
Q. The interview is your daughter™s doing?
 

A. That she insist ed that I do this interview. 
I woul dn™t ha ve done it on my own. Because I feel 
that my story is not really that compelling, certain
ly not as compelling   as peoples™ who were in 
concentration camps, who were hidd
en in attics, or forests or  
horrible places. That I did not 
suffer in that sense. I always feel kind of, not 
guilty, but I don™t think that 
my story deserves that 
much attention. Let™s put it that way. But 
she insisted that I do it, and I agreed.
 
Q. Wonderful, thank you, we are glad that you agreed.
 
A. We ll thank you, it was really a great experience.
 
Q. Thanks, I am going to stop recording now.
