HEDWIG ROSE 
 July 14, 2005 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Hedy. 
Answer: Hi. 

Q: It™s really lovely to see you 
after all these ye
ars, we me t -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- ma ybe what?  10 years ago, I think. 

A: Right. I think you™re right. 

Q: So it™s -- it™s really lovely. 
Hedy, what was your name  -- what 
is your name  now?  Tell us your 
name  now. 

A: Well, sort  of formally and legally, it™s -- it™s
 Hedwig C. Rose. On my passport it™s Hedwig 
Cohen Rose. I do have another mi ddle name , it sort of got dropped along the way, which is 

Hella. So I was Hedwig Hella Cohen, and 
then became Rose after I was married. 
Q: So, at birth you were Hedwig Hella -- 

A: Right. 

Q: Cohen.  

A: Right. 

Q: Right. And when were you born?  

A: February eighth, 1936.  

Q: And whe r e? 

A: In Amsterdam, in The Netherlands.

Q: Right. Now, I -- I have no idea whether it™s po
ssible to do this, but 
as we™re speaking, since 
you were such a young person, if there™s a way for 
you to distinguish what you really reme mber 
-- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- as that kid, versus what you 
were told later, if there™s a wa
y of doing that as we speak -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- it would be -- it would be very helpful. 

A: I think so. Of course, it™s anybody™s
 guess how accurate I am about that. 

Q: Right. 

A: But it™s -- it™s certainly true
 that I am able to at least co
mment about what I think are later 
deductions as opposed to early me mo ri
es, mm-hm. Be glad to do that.  
Q: Let™s talk a little bi
t about your family, your -- let™s talk
 first about your father, who has one 
of those longest name s that I™ve ever heard in my life. Can you give us his full name ?  
A: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl Cohen.Did I leave out one? Oh, Frederick -- 
Q: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl -- 

A: I ma y ha ve left out -- 

Q: Frederick. 

A: Frederick, right, Cohen. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right. 

Q: Where do all these name
s come from, do you know?   
A: I don™t know because my paternal grandparents had already died when I was old enough to 

reme mber anything as a toddler. So
 I have no idea where they came from. It ma y also have been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
3 
 
the fashion at the time to give people more than
 -- although that™s not re
ally true because my 
uncle who was born in Vi enna, only had one name
. So ma ybe it had to do with Sephardic as 
opposed to Ashkenazic Jews. Maybe it had to do 
with Holland versus Aust
ria. Maybe it had to 
do with whatever the background of my father™s
 parents was, which I 
don™t know. I don™t know 
what their occupation was or anything. 
Q: Do you reme mber if he was called Jac
que?  Was he known by his first name , or -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: He was? 

A: He was. 

Q: And wha t  did he do? 

A: He actually was a baker, but a baker in Amer
ican parlance has sort of -- sort of a vague 
meaning, but the kind of baker he was, was one 
of these European bakers who did all these 
specialty desserts. And he -- I only
 recently learned from my sister, 
my older si ster, that he was a 
baker on the Holland-America line. And apparently 
before he was ma rried, he -- that™s what he 
did. And at some  point, I don™t exactly know whe r e 
in -- in the yearly chronology, he decided he 
wasn™t going to do this any more. And they pr
evailed on him to do it once more, and do it once 
more, and I guess he did it, he did -- went one more
 trip and they said we want you to take one 
more trip, and I -- I guess he put
 his foot down and said, I™m not
 doing it any more. And the -- 
that voyage, that ship that he said no to appare
ntly was detonated by some  torpedo that was left 
over from World War 
1
. So that whatever it was, fate, wh
atever, saved him when he decided no, 
he wasn™t going to do this any more. But that™s 
what he did. And he had 
a bakery in Amsterdam,  
but I was never there, and we had alr
eady moved from there when I was born. 
Q: So when you were born, did he have the bakery? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
4 
 
A: I think he still owned the bake
ry, but he didn™t work at it. A
nd I -- I know that he left the 
house every day, but I™m not really sure where he went. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the only baking that I was familiar with
 was what he did on Sunday mornings. It was 
traditional that he baked a pound cake. And so the 
house was always filled 
with this wonderful 
smell of baked goods, and his pound cake was incomparable. 

Q: Really? 

A: I have spent my life trying to find one
 like it, but it is impossible, it seems. 
Q: Is that one of your earliest me mories -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- of your father, is -- is
 baking at -- the pound cake? 
A: Well actually, the more prevalent and early me
mory is probably one of -- of him pla ying 
game s with me . Being left at the dinner or break
fast tabl e with my father is an early me mory, 
because I didn™t eat. And they used
 to say I lived off the air. I just was not a child who ate a lot, 
and I -- or at all, and so he was the one elected 
to amuse me  a nd tell me  stories. And he would 
pull out the contents of his pocke
ts and ma ke up stories, and th
en occasionally try to slide a 
spoonful of something or other in
 my mouth. And that -- that™s so
rt of my  earlies
t recollection, it 
-- it™s one of the very early ones. 

Q: Huh. You took walks with your
 father also. Was -- was that
 after the occupation, or do you 
reme mber [i ndecipherabl e] 

A: I very much reme mb er it before also. 

Q: Also. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
5 
 
A: It was sort of our special tim
e of day together, and he would co
me home from -- as I say from 
wherever, I don™t know from where. And -- and then 
he and I would go for a walk just the two of 
us, and we would walk in the neighborhood, around 
the block or whatever, and it -- it was both 
before the occupation and 
for a short time after. 
Q: Did he also walk with your sister, or
 was this very special for you?  Do you know? 
A: If he walked with my  sister I don™t know 
about it, but he may have been one of these 
wonderful parents who knew how to ma ke each child feel very special and -- and he pr obably 
did some thing with her, or ma ybe a walk or so
mething else with her. I-I don™t know, I actually 
never asked her. But there was always this little 
bit of time for us, and it 
wa s generally -- I don™t 
reme mber if it was after or befo
re supper, but it was either very
 late in the af
ternoon, or early 
evening. 

Q: And you™d have conversations? 

A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
Q: And would you tell -- would he ask you what 
your day was like, was that the -- or was it 
different?  
A: I don™t think he asked me  what  my day was like. My sort of 
recollection, and as I say here, 
I™m not really sure this is a recollection or whet
her I imagined this, that we talked at  a child™s 
level about some thing very present. There wasn
™t stuff about what di
d you do, or what are you 
going to do, but more -- more about do you hear that
 bird singing, or s-some thing rooted in the 
present that a -- a -- rooted in the experien
ce we were having toge
ther at that time.  
Q: Wa s his way of behaving with you, it -- as 
-- from what you can reme mber, different from 
other fathers?  It doesn™t sound like 
the usual story of a father bei
ng so concerned about the kids.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496

A: I -- if I say this is unusual, it come s from
 a -- a long backwards and adult perspective and 
certainly not a child™s memory because I had no id
ea what another father mi ght have been like. 
But I would say yes. I would say for several re
asons. Numbe r  one, he was an extreme l y gentle 
and patient ma n, which is the reason he took -- 
took all the stuff out of his pocket forever and 
ever and ever, and in fact one of those things 
sort of backfired, because I knew that among the 
treasur es he  had in his pocket wa
s a small pair of scissors. And one
 time he and I were sitting in 
the living room of our house, and we had very h
eavy oak, dark, dark oak furniture, sort of dark, 
dark -- you know that heavy European furniture. A
nd over the big, big table 
in the mi ddle of this 
living room -- w-why this living room had this gr
eat big table sort of like -- more like a dining 

room table, I don™t know, but that™s the wa
y it was set up. And the 
table had these heavy 
crosspieces underneath. And there 
was a plush tableclot h, if you can imagine, it™s more the kind 
of thing you can imagine over a piano, but it was ove
r the table, and it had long fringes on it, and 
it was over the table in such a way that the points
 of the cloth were on th
e ends and so forth. And 
it was great place for me , I always had my little hi de
out there, it was a little 
-- like a little house, 
and I asked to borrow the scissors one day, and 
I climbed under there and 
I gave the tablecloth a 
haircut. Not fun at the time. But was he different
? I think he was also different because I think 
my mother was probably an early femi nist 
in ma ny ways, although I don™t think she called 
herself that at the time. She was the working part
ner in the hou -- in the 
home at the time that I 
reme mber, anyway, and she had, apparently, a very unusual and important job for a woma n in 

some  kind of financial activity. Just exactly what
 it was, I never really knew or understood, and -
- so she was out of my circle for much of the 
day. She was also not the one who was either as 
patient  or as fun loving as I re-reme mber my fath
er being. Not that my father was necessarily fun 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
7 
 
loving, but he was -- h-he smiled readily, as opposed
 to ma ybe yelling at me , which is more what  
I  r e me mb e r  fr o m my  mo t h e r . 
Q: Uh-huh. So she was the disciplinarian. 

A: Probably, although from my poi
nt of view it wasn™t -- you know
, it was never fair, and it was 
never -- 

Q: Right. So who took care of you during the day 
then, if you -- both of 
your parents are out -- 
you don™t know what your father™s doing, but
 your mother™s certainly working. 

A: Right. Well, it wasn™t unusual fo
r people of even modest means to
 have help in those days. I 
mean, this is now the 30™s we™re 
talking. And we did have what was known as a me isje, or a girl, 

who -- who worked for us, and -- and in fact I 
reme mber -- I -- I reme mb er s -- being served, 
when I was still in my crib, I remember her br in
ging me  breakfast in the 
crib, and the breakfast 
consisted of these things called Dutch rusk. I don™
t know if you know wha t  those are, but it™s sort 
of a light and airy kind of toasty
 thing of about a half an inch
 thick. And she always had them 
drenched in honey. And so she would bring me  th
ese things in the crib, and the honey would be 
all over the place, and I hated it. I just despised
 it, and everything was st -- then sticky and 
drippy, and you know, and you can imagine a toddler 
in the crib, and the honey. So yes, I think 
she was probably one that took care of us. 

Q: So how old do you think you were when you were 
in the crib?  Two, three?
 Ye -- ye -- I mean, 
that™s a clear me mory for  you. 

A: It™s a very clear me mory, and since it was a 
crib, I must have been two or so. Couldn™t -- 
couldn™t leave that sticky me mory behind. 

Q: And your sist -- tell me 
what your mother -- what -- wh
at was your mother™s name? 
A: Rosa, Rosa Schwarz. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
8 
 
Q: And was there difference in your parent™s 
age, do you know?  Or were they pretty close 
together?  
A: I-I™m not  really sure. It™s
 possibl e that my mot her was maybe a year older or so. 

Q: I see. 

A: Or maybe more. I-I don™t really
 know. I know my mother was a very -- with me was a very 
late parent  -- mother. I mean, there are eight
 years difference between my s i ster and me . 
Q: Right. 

A: And I think that she ma rried 
rather late, as well, so I™m -- 
yeah, I™m -- I™m sort of guessing 
that she was in her 40™s when I was born. 

Q: Right. Hm. Wa s pretty late then. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And your sister Betsy was ei
ght years older than you. And do you 
have a recollection as a kid, 
of this older sister? 
A: Oh yes, very clearly, because 
I -- in addition to -- to a meisje
 who was taking care of us, she 
obviously as the big sister was often put in char
ge, and I always resented that terribly. And I 
think my poor sist er suffered horribly because of
 that, because  I would probably always giver her 
a hard time . I guess I was fairly headstrong. 
I™m not above throwing 
a temper tantrum and 
screaming, yelling and crying, and my poor sister ha
d to put up with all that. So -- yeah, and -- 
and basically, I think my sister and I are -- are 
-- are some what differentpersonalities to begin 
with. So I don™t think that was 
an easy thing for her, and -- 
and it wasn™t fun for me , you know, 
and there was -- it created this si
ster sibling sort of irritation. I 
because I didn™t want to be told 
that I couldn™t do something, and she because I 
didn™t want to do what she said I had to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496

Q: Right, right. What wa s the house like where 
you lived?  Did you 
live in an apartme nt, did you 
live in a house? 
A: No, actually we lived in -- we lived in this
 very, very -- I guess bourgeois is probably the 
English equivalent word for it, but in a -- a very, 
very nice residential area, not too far from the 
Rijksmuseum, on the Pieter de Hooch Straat. 
And it was all residential, so there was no 
commercial activity going on there at all, which 
ma kes the presence of what was going on in our 
house even more puzzling, because my mother work
ed in the house, in -- in two rooms of our 
house was this contore or -- or office, as sh
e would call it. And in Holland as you -- well, 
certainly in Amsterdam,  all the 
houses are built so that they 
are smack up against each other. 
And there is no sort of stand alone housing. A
nd it goes all the way around the four sides of a 
block that way. And what you have is people livi
ng on the ground floor, people living on the first 
floor, and another couple second, and another on 
the third. And then the house part, what we 
called ground floor, or caw -- or house, has access 
to the backyards. And the backyards are all 
pretty private, all su
rrounded by wooden fences, both in th
e mi ddle and on the sides. So you 
really have a-again, a -- a greater European sens
e of privacy, while at the same  ti me  you can see 

into those yards from the  first, second and thir d floor, not only of your building, but the one next 

to you on either side, and the one behind you from 
the other street. So th
ere™s -- yes, there is 
privacy, and no there isn™t privacy
 in -- in some  way. And this 
house that we had was brick, as 
most houses were, and there is not the front lawn
 kind of thing, and there™s not the -- the curb 
lawn and so forth as we know it here, but -- but a 
city street, really, alt
hough it was residential. 
And we had -- that was unusual too, we had th
e ground floor, the house part
 and the first floor. 
But the first f -- two rooms of the ground floor we
re this office. But there was nothing on the 
front door, there was no ma rk of a
ny kind, or title, or -- or  -- or  
whatever. So I™m still a little bit 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
10 
 
at a loss as to what this outf
it was, I™m only learning now from my sister who were the name -- 
what were the name s of some  of the -- well, I 
did know one of the name s, th-the boss was Mr. 
Halle. And I know that my mother disappeared 
in these two rooms for much of the day, but 
that™s about the extent of it. 
Q: So sh -- you don™t know if she was an accountan
t, or she was a -- noth -- you have no idea? 

A: N-No. My sister mi ght 
actually know that better. 
Q: She mi ght. Uh-huh. But she didn™t come
 out, for the most part, during those -- 
A: No, she mi ght come  out, you know, for -- briefl
y for a couple of mi nut es during the day. At 
least that™s my me mory. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: You know, I don™t know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- actually if --  
Q: Right. 
A: -- if it™s accurate. For all 
I know she spent considerable time
 outside of it with me, only I 
don™t reme mber it. 

Q: You don™t reme mber it. But you weren™t as co
mfortable with your mother as you we re with 
your father at all, were you? 

A: Mm- mm, mm- mm. No, I th -- I think partly
 because -- I mean later on becomi ng a working 
woma n mys e lf, I had a little more sympathy forthat. Because you ma y have limited time, you™re 

trying to spend it with your chil
d, the child doesn™t understand th
at urgency of the mo me nt. You 
want him or her to do x, y and z before you go back
 to the office, and th
ey™re not doing it. It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
11 
 
creates a lot of stress an
d strain. And I always had the sense 
some how that my mother was very 
nervous, that she was anxious, that she was tens
e. And I never had that with my father.  
Q: With your father. 
A: Now, as I say, that ma y all be -- I mean, the 
older I got the more appr
eciation I had of all of 
the difficulties that these adults
 were going through, right throughout. 
Q: Yeah, right throughout the period. W- We re there kids aro
und in the neighborhood so you had 
friends?  

A: We ll, the only child I reme mber being around wa
s the child next door. And this child lived I -

- it was either the second or th
e third story apartment next door
. But because as I explained you 
can look into these yards, very often I would run 
into the yard and call up to her and she would 
come  running out to the veranda, and so forth, 
and then she™d say, oh I will come  over, or 
whatever. And she™d come  over and play in our yard because  we had the yard and they didn™t, 

they only had the veranda. And -- and of course 
one of my very earliest hurtful and -- and 
shocking me mories is of me  doi
ng exactly that, running out one da
y, as I did so ma ny days and 
calling up to her to come  out and play and she came  to the edge of the veranda and she yelled 

dirty Jew at me  and spat on me  
from the veranda. And I think it 
was the fi rst really sort of 
crushing childhood blow for -- for what that 
means when some one does that to you. And 
some thing that we sort of underestimate always 
in terms of i t s impact when we, for example, 
deal with kids in school and their interactions
 and the bullying that takes place and the yelling 
and the -- y-you know, the sticks 
and stones line doesn™t hold. 
Q: Right. 

A: Words can and do hurt.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
12 
 
Q: That particular scene betw
een you and -- and your friend, wa
s that -- that™s after the 
occupation of 1940, that you reme mber
 [indecipherable] happened -- 
A: The thing that I have trouble with
 of course, is the chronology here. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, sure. 
A: I™m not sure. 

Q: Cause you would have been four years old. Du
ring the occupation you would have been four, 
right? 

A: Yeah, right. So my guess is it was some  -- it w
ould have to be after. It would have had to be 

after, I™m guessing. Wha t  I don™t remember is ex
actly when and where th
is happened in relation 
to my starting school, which was mor e  of a -- what
 do you call that, sort of a ma rker, y -- a time , 
chronology ma rker for me . I just have the recollection 
of that incident, and -- and it™s sort of a -- 
a little bit -- perhaps out 
of sequence ma ybe now. 
Q: But it doesn™t matter, it doesn
™t ma tter. You started s -- so 
y-your -- y-you don™t have a clear 
perception of the occupation, begi
nning of the occupation, or do you? 
A: I have a clear recollection of 
the beginning of this sort of -- 
what I later understood as a really 
sort of ma niacal way of building up the fear in 
the population. So the first time that I was aware 

that there wa s a ma jor difference going on outside
 my home was the fact
 that I had started 
school, and then I had stopped school. So that wa
s probably the first, although it mi ght have been 
preceded by taking one of these walks with my dad, and the same  wonderful walks that we used 

to take, and going down the street, I reme mber 
the -- there was a school 
opposite our house. It 
wasn™t the school that I went t
o, but it was some  other school, a
nd again there was no lawn in the 
front, but they did have these so
rt of both orname ntal and -- a
nd physical heavy iron chains. And 
I used to love to sit on those and swing on them. 
But I wasn't  doing that with my father, we were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
13 
 
-- we were going out for a walk and going down 
the block and turning right as we did, and I 
reme mber there on the opposite, diag
onally opposite side of the street used to be an empty lot. 
And all of a sudden this particular day we 
went there, and it was 
all surrounded in wooden 
fencing, but not your attractive fenci
ng or whatever, but in these -- it™s
 the stuff that they used to 
have around baseball -- corner 
lot baseball thing -- I mean, I 
don™t know -- exactly know how to 
say it, but you couldn™t -- there we
re these vertical planks next
 to each other and you couldn™t 
look through them. And so all of a sudden there 
is no empty lot except for this wooden fencing 
all around, and all of a sudden there is an opening 
in the fence, a door and 
a -- and a Nazi soldier 
walks out. And he is striding down the street and 
he come s towards my fa ther and he asks him 
for a light for his ci garette. And I -- I reme mber al
most as if it was yesterday, that my father, this 
patient , gentle man, really tensed, and lit the soldie
r™s cigarette. And the soldier very politely said 
thank you and walked on. And my 
father swore under his breath. A
nd I could sense this man™s 
behavior was so out of character from how Iknew hi m, that I knew that there was some thing 
amiss, but I, again had no -- no -- certainly no kn
owledge at the time what that meant. And what 
he said under his breath was Rot mof. Rot mof being 
the -- mof being the derogatory term used for 
the Nazis, and the rot meaning 
rotten. You know, so he was saying 
basically, rotten Nazi. And I 
didn™t know what Nazi meant, a
nd I couldn™t understand why he w
ould be saying this. I -- when 
I saw this soldier comi ng out I 
didn™t know s -- I didn™t know from
 soldiers, I really didn™t 
understand anything. If you™re 
asking me  what was my childhood me mory, I knew he was a 
soldier, that  was -- 
Q: That was it. 

A: -- that was it. And I only knew he was called 
a Rotmof, because that™s what my father said. 
Q: Did you know at the time that it 
was a swearword, or -- or was it -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
14 
 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Y-You did. 

A: Well, hard to say, I -- I kne
w that it was some thing that 
was probably not good because he 
didn™t say it out loud. And I knew 
that it was probably some thing that I wasn™t supposed to copy, 
because he di dn™t say it out law -- loud. I don™
t think -- I don™t reme mb
er, but I don™t think I 
asked him what he said. 

Q: But you re -- but you do reme mbe r  it. 

A: Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

Q: Is it possible that you felt his anger, possibly 
even fear, and you were very hesitant to say 
what -- 

A: I™m sure. 

Q: [indecipherable] felt some thing. 

A: I™m sure I must have felt something, because it 
wasn™t like  me  not to either question, or to -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- I -- I -- I™m sure I must have absorbed so
mething that was of that
 nature. It was probably 
anger at that point, and not fear. I don™t reme mbe r
 -- I do remember the anger. And I c -- I sensed 
that he ha d suppressed anger. And it was a whole 
new e motion for me  because that was not what 
he ever displayed.  

Q: And you, when you went to school, were y -- ar
e you five years old or six years old at -- 
A: Six. 

Q: Oh, six. There™s no ki -- 

A: Th-There was no public kindergarten, no.  

Q: So you were -- it™s 1942 when you go to school. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
15 
 
A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
Q: So you were only able to go for a couple of weeks? 

A: Right, right. 

Q: And as I understand it, that was really upset
ting to you, because you very much wanted to go 
to school, yes? 

A: Yeah. Well, in talking -- in referring back to
 this tension between my s i ster and me , I mean 
here she was not only this big girl who had all th
is responsibility and this
 power over me , and she 
was a schoolgirl and she had time set aside for 
doing home work and it was very much respected 
what she did, and -- and actually she was in th
e -- a student in the gymnasium, which is the 
Dutch so -- college preparatory, and the heavy 
duty curriculum of history and geography and 
algebra and geometry and German a nd French 
and English and Greek and Latin. And here she 
was partaking of these mysterious disciplines and 
this must have some thing to do with the fact 
that she had the responsibility for me . So I thoug
ht, well if I can access that also, then she won™t 
have to do this any more, ma ybe. So I was very excited about starting school. I thought this was 

just going to be, you know, this was -- this wa
s my way to heaven. And -- and -- and I couldn™t 
wait, I really couldn™t wait, I wa
s so excited. And I don™t think I re ally had more than a couple of 
weeks when I was no longer allowed to go to school. 

Q: We  have to change the tape now.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Hedy, do you have any recollection whether 
your sister was as unhappy about school 
stopping?  Ca use obviously she couldn™t go to school either. 
A: Right. I don™t have any 
real recollection, but havi
ng just visited her, as we are always wont to 
do, we tend to try to spend some  ti me both remi
niscing and sort of corroborating me mories. And 

we™ve tried to make that a little 
bit more formal project, but that
 hasn™t worked too well because  
of our individual lives sort of diverging and so on. But she shared with me , and I actually have it, 

I haven™t had a chance to look at 
it, a book that was written about wh
at happened at that time, to 
her school and her schoolmates. And -- and hersel
f for that ma tter. What -- what happened was 
that before the stopping of school
, what -- what was done was one of these ma ny decrees that 
was offered. And the decree was that no -- that al
l the Jewish children had to go to the Jewish 
school -- to a Jewish school, or 
a school that was set aside as 
a Jewish school. Now, why they 
didn™t do that with the elementary school kids, 
I don™t know, and for all I know they did, except 
perhaps it was too far, or it -- my folks didn™
t think it was important, 
I don™t know. But for the 
high school, they did set aside some thing wa -- 
which they called the j
oodse -- I think it was 
called the joodse lyceum. And so -- so all the Jewi sh
 kids were sort of pulled out of their s -- 
respective schools and told to go to this one school
. And then they were tol -- and then were told 
there wasn™t going to be any more school at all fo
r the Jewish kids. And th
en, what I just learned, 
which I didn™t know, was that apparently ma ny of
 the teachers continued to try to teach these 
kids, and that the kids were meeti
ng at respective parent™s home s, 
as ma ny of -- of them as could. 
And this book that she s
howed me  was a book that was written 
by her -- one of her teachers from 
the gymnasium, who ca me  with these kids and -- 
and taught them. I think I have this correct. 
And the book is basically not only a story of 
how this unfolded, and how they moved from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
17 
 
whose home  to which home  and where it was 
located, and what happened when a particular 
student wasn™t there, and ever
yone knew what had happened, whic
h was that that family had 
been called up and deported. So ther
e was this constant threat th
at ran through the me etings for 
however long they were able to -- to -- to ca
rry on, about people disa
ppearing, and the students 
being quite aware of this, and the teachers being ve
ry aware of this. And yet, trying to continue 
to keep going and to keep going, and then as Isay, I have not had a chance to look at this book, 
but the book has since -- she was 
also interviewed for that. And one of the appendices in the 
book has the lists of all the students by the year that
 they should have been in -- in this school, 
and basically tells you what, to the 
best of this ma n™s a-ability, happe
ned to each of these, and -- 
and how -- how this all just came to pass. And it™
s -- it™s all there docum
ented and the -- and the 
diffi culties of meeting in the homes, and the -- and 
the effort on people to try to create some 
sense of norma lcy for these kids, who were clea
rly much, mu ch, much more aware of what was 
happening than I certainly was. I me an, I had not a 
clue that she was even doing this at the time. 
Q: Right, and she would have, at your -- when you™re five, sh
e™s what? Thirt -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 - 11 -- 13 - 14. 

A: Right. 

Q: 13 or 14 years old. So she™s much -- she™s clear
ly much older. Do you not have any schooling 
then?  The school stops, there™
s no tutoring, there™s nothing? 
A: Nothing. But then again, it wasn™t ve
ry long until -- until it stopped for everybody. 
Q: Yes. 

A: For my si ster, as well. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
18 
 
Q: Right, right. Now, I -- as I understand it, you
r father is pi cked up on a number of occasions 
and then come s back. Do you have r
ecollections of his being taken? 
A: Yes. 

Q: We re you in the house and saw it? 

A: Yes. I do reme mber seeing it, I do reme mber 
being aware of it. I had, for example a very -- I 
have still, to this day, very clear me mories of 
not being able to move about without wearing a 
jacket that ha d the Jewish star 
on it. And I can™t reme mber in the 
order of things when this came , 
but I do dist inctly reme mber that -- th-that our 
walks had to stop because we  weren't allowed -- 
after dark we  weren™t allowed to come  out -- s -- go outside. And I do reme mber him being 

taken, and I reme mber the anxiety and the tens
ion. And I do reme mber him comi ng back, and 

this imme  -- enormous relief when he came b
ack. And this happened se
veral times, and it™s -- 
again in -- in reflecting about th
is time, and thinking about it 
over these ma ny, many years, I™m 
just struck by another psychological ma nipula
tion of the population, you 
know, th-this constant 
instilling of some  activity that would raise th
e level of anxiety, certainly among the Jews. 
Q: Do you reme mber learning later where your fath
er went?  I-I™m sure they didn™t say anything 
to you when he came back, but do you have any idea where he was taken? 

A: I have no idea where he was taken except I 
reme mber being told or hearing -- overhearing 
them say that he was being taken away for questioning. And I have no idea why they took my 

father, I have no idea what they were questio
ning him about. I don™t know whether my sister 
knows that, or whether this conceivably wa
s now coinciding with the beginning of the 
deportation of the eastern European
 Jews who had fled to Holland 
in an effort to escape  what 
was going on on the eastern front. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
19 
 
A: And -- and so ma ny of these people were orig
inally housed at We ster
bork and -- cause there 
was no place to keep them. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so they, in a sense, were sort of sitting ducks for being the fi rst de -- deportees. And -- 

and that then later became  a kind 
of holding camp, really. It™s possibl
e that they were trying to do 
this kind of random que stioning in order to ma ke 
sure that the rest of 
the Jews didn™t flee. I 

mean, Holland being what it is, a
nd where it is, there wasn™t really
 a lot we could do on -- as was 
the unfortunate fate of those who fled to Ho
lland. It™s a tiny country, 
about the size of New 
Jersey, I think, flat as a pancak
e, a lot of it reclaimed land from
 the sea. You know, you can kind 
of look -- stand in one pl ace and look to the beac
h and the shore and so forth. There were no hills 
and mountain caves or thick forests where people 
could flee or hide. So you were in a s -- in a 
sense a captive, you know, with your back against 
the sea. And I know that
 all these countries 
ma de a desperate ef -- or at leas
t the Jews in those countries ma de
 a desperate effort to get across 
the channel, get across the sea a
nd -- and -- and go someplace else. But unfortunately that didn™t 
work for a lot of people. 

Q: D-Do you reme mber that you didn™t have very 
much food during this 
-- this is -- I™m -- I™m 
now asking before your father is act
ually arrested and you don™t see -- 
A: No, I have no me mory of not having enough food at that time. 

Q: You don™t. 

A: No. Of c ourse not -- not bei
ng a big eater, I mi ght not have re
gist er ed that. But I -- I re -- 
don™t have any recollection of 
not having food at that time. 
Q: So you rema ined not a very good eater, whic
h -- which ended up, I suppose, being fortunate. 
A: Perhaps. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
20 
 
Q: In the e -- 
A: Perhaps. 

Q: In the end. 

A: Yeah, I think that a -- in fact, I have an 
early me mory -- I have ear
ly me mories and they 
probably were beforehand, before occupation -- 
ma ybe not -- of going to the ma rket with my 
mother, but then again, that was one of the thi
ngs that became  forbidden. We couldn™t go to the 
public market, but I remember going at some point 
in this time with my mother, and I always 
loved animals, and I always wanted to pet the ho
rses. I mean, the -- the ma
rket consisted of all 
these horse drawn carriages lined up and -- and peopl
e peddled their wares fr
om the -- from these 
carts. And she was always, forever pulling me  away
 from the horses, and I -- that was not where 
I wanted to be. But I -- I always wanted to talk
 to the animals and pet 
the animals and so forth. 
Q: Did you have an animal?  

A: No. 
Q: You didn™t. Did you wa
nt one in your house? 
A: At -- I think at that time I was so young that 
I didn™t know that that 
mi ght be a possibility. 
Q: I see. 
A: Also I™m not sure whether -- whether that was 
frequently the possibility
 in the city. Certainl y 
would have been very happy to have one, but I 
don™t -- I don™t know. My -- my li mited world at 
that time did not make that something I wa
nted, cause I didn™t know it wa s possible. 
Q: Do you reme mber being bored, 
or did you -- did you have all so
rts of things that you were 
doing in the course of the day, so 
not going to school wasn™t too bad? 
A: You me a n, when I could no longer go to school? 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
21 
 
A: That time I think was fairly short, between th
e time that we had to go 
into hiding, and the time  
that I was out of school. I -- 
I think there was a brief peri
od I mi ght have been bored.  
Q: Uh-huh, not so -- 
A: But I don™t reme mber  it too well. 

Q: Right. 

A: I reme mb er a little bit sort of rummaging ar
ound the garden and sort of finding things to do. I-
I don™t reme mber toys at this time  at all, no recoll
ection of -- of things that were mi ne, I only had 
recollections of things in the hous
e, or things in the yard. I reme
mber there must not have been 
good and adequate refrigeration space because
 my parents kept limburger cheese in the 
coalhouse in the backyard, you know, 
the house that contained the coal for the heating and so on. 
And so it must be that that was because it was 
cold. Or ma ybe it was because it was smelly, I 
don™t know. Or both? 

Q: Right. 
A: So -- and no, I -- actually it must have b
een refrigeration because I have  this va gue 
recollection some ti me s of 
a pitcher of milk -- 
Q: Being put there. 
A: -- also going back there. 

Q: Uh-huh. Do you remember any relig
ious observance in your house? 
A: None. 

Q: None. 

A: None. I -- I have actually no 
recollection of anything that I 
would tie to -- to a remotely 
religious thing except that possibl
y there was a -- a large dinner 
with a lot of people, and that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
22 
 
mi ght have been a holiday, or a Passover Seder or 
some thing, but I didn™t re
gister that way in my 
mi nd. 
Q: Did you know you were Jewish? 

A: N-No, I don™t think I did. I reme mber once 
going to some  -- some  kind of Sunda y school 
assembly hall or some thing, and I -- I -- I sort of 
think that my  folks mi ght have been sort of 
exploring the possibility of havi
ng me go there. And I didn™t really
 like it, it was very chaotic, 
and th -- and there wasn™t any fun as far as I 
could tell. I mean, it was nothing that I reme mber 

with any positive or negative feeli
ng, but I remember this sort of one time trip there, and then 
that was more or less it. There was no -- there 
was no discuss -- no -- no keeping the Sabbath, n -
- as far as I know. No candle lighting, no -- if th
ere was, I don™t know it, 
and I don™t reme mber it. 
It mi ght have been part of th
e every day world, and -- but I don™
t recall it. I had no idea what it 
meant to be Jewish, none. And wa -- and I thinkwhen this child called me  a dirty Jew, I -- 

Q: Cause I was just going to ask you 
that. Did it mean anything to you? 
A: Nothing. It was by the fact that she spat 
on me , and the ma nner in which she threw these 
words at me  that I understood it was some thing nega
tive. But I had no sense of what that meant, 
none. 

Q: Did you ask your father, or your mother?  Di
d you go in the house and say why did she say 
this?  Do you reme mber? 

A: I don™t have any recollection of
 it. It would seem strange th
at I would not have, because I 
reme mber being very upset. It™s possible th
at there was no one around at the mo ment and I 
couldn™t talk to 
anyone about it. 
Q: Right. 

A: It™s possible that I was given some
 answer by some body but it didn™t register. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
23 
 
Q: What registered was what
 the -- what -- what -- 
A: What regi stered was -- 
Q: What the kid did. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. When you have to put on -- when you put
 on your jacket and it ha
d a Jewish star on it, 
did this mean anything to you, or was just well
, this is what I have to do. Do you remember? 
A: It was th -- well, this is what I have to do, a
nd it was also a way in which I began to put pieces 
of the puzzle together in a way, in the sense that
 I did realize there was 
some  connection between 
what the girl said to me -- what this child sp
at at me , and the word on the jacket. There was a 
connection and I did realize that 
there was -- that I basically was 
now being labeled, that I was, 
you know, that I was Jew, and that that was -- that
 that was a way of ma king sure that everyone 
else knew I was a Jew. And th-that left a kind of 
-- what™s the word I want?  Sort of an unclear, 
but an -- a -- a -- it left a feeling of understa
nding what was happening, 
but not -- there was no 
understanding of why a nd how come and who was ma
king us do that. I d -- I just began to sense 

that there wa s a connection between what was on th e jacket, and what the ch
ild had said, and that 
there was some  reason that people needed to be 
able to recognize me  a
nd knew that -- and know 
that I was a Jew. And why, or
 how come , or what was it a
bout being a Jew that needed 
dema rcation labeling, I had no idea.  

Q: So, when you™re given the jacket 
with the Jew -- you -- it says Jood? 
A: Jo -- J-o-o-d. 

Q: J-o-o -- yeah -- on it, 
nobody explains this to you? 
A: If they did, I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
24 
 
A: I don™t reme mber. 
Q: Do you reme mber seeing other people wearing it? 

A: I reme mb er my -- yes, I think I did, actually. 
I certainly reme mber my 
fa mily wearing it, and I 
think that the -- there we
re -- I -- we were not actually livi
ng in a Jewish area, in a pronounced, 
predominantly Jewish area, so I didn™t real
ly know about the whole Jewish section of 
Amsterdam until I was an adult and went back to 
Amsterdam and -- and actually tour ed that ar ea 
and saw the synagogues and was in the Jewish mu
seum and s a w the statue comme morating the 
uprising and the strike and so fo
rth. I -- I knew nothing of that as 
a child, so that ma y account in 
part for why I didn™t see more of that. And it wa
sn™t really until I was an adult and I s-studied 
lots of stuff, including the whole psychological ph
enomena of -- of labeling and what that me ans. 

And -- and I™m sure you™re familiar with a very, 
very powerful piece that was done right after 
Martin Luther King died, by the te
acher in Riceville, Iowa, which ﬁFrontlineﬂ featured on PBS, 
and I have since used with my students a good 
ma ny times, which is just basically having the 
children experience what happens when you do -- 
do label and stigmatize people. Some times it™s 
called -- the program is called, ﬁBlue Eyes, Brown Ey
es.ﬂ There™s another ve
rsion of it that also 
takes this wo ma n into prisons and other areas of 
-- in -- of human interaction where she tries the 

same  thing with adults, and it works almost mo
re successfully even. And -- and that™s called, 
ﬁThe Eye of the Storm.ﬂ I™ve forgotten which one come s first, but -- and then she also has 

another -- she has a reunion with th
at  fi rst cl ass with whom she tr
ies it, and it is incr edible how 
positive the influence on these people this early 
exercise  was, where, you know, she -- she ma kes 

the attempt to have the children understand what
 it™s like when you do that
 to people. And she 
separates them according to the color of their 
eyes. And then she says to the children, you know, 
I understand that -- first 
she tries it with whatever, blue eyes
, and she says, I understand that you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
25 
 
-- I -- I have just learned that -- that blue eyed 
people are just not as smart as brown eyed people. 
And then later in the day she says, you know, they
™re not even as attentiv
e, and they™re not as 
good as -- you know, she goes on and on with this. 
And then she said, you know wha t , we should 
label these people so that we can mor e  easily 
recognize them, and then 
we don™t have to choose 
them on the team, and we don™t have to play with them, because they™re not as smart as we are. 
And so why don™t we put collars 
on them. And then you see this whole effect of what this 
labeling does to these third or f
ourth graders. And -- and i-i-it™s
 -- it™s an eye opener. It™s 
shocking. 

Q: Do you think that that™s -- that happened to 
you, that -- that having th
is star on you ma de you 

feel inferior, or you -- because you describe 
it as not really knowing what™s going on. 
A: I -- not for me , but I was six years old. 

Q: Right. 

A: Now, when kids are nine, th
ere™s a whole different ball game
. And when you™re
 an adult it™s 
different, and when you™re 14 like my 
sister, it™s altoge
ther different.  
Q: Right. [indecipherable] right. 

A: And of c ourse the -- the thi
ngs that you associate with the la
bel also have some thing to do 
with it. If you put the collars on and you tell pe
ople they™re smarter, then you get the reverse 
effect. 

Q: Right. 

A: And you do, you do. You tell the kids 
they™re smarter, they behave, 
th -- I mean that this is -- 
a lot of educational research is 
out there. You tell the kids they
™re smarter, they perform better. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
26 
 
A: But -- but that  was not the intention here by th
e Nazis, clearly. And actua
lly this is the kind of 
thing that -- that when I was ta
lking to you earlier about sharing r
ecollections of the war year, the 
pre-war years with my Dutch friend, who becam
e  the professor of religion at Smith, he 
reme mbers when this was being -- this was going
 on in the town where he grew up, I think it was 
Breda. And he said all of a sudden the kids, his 
buddies at school took this as forma l  approval of 
doing stuff like yelling epithets at people who were 
wearing the star. I -- I mean, th-they took this 
as open season, essentially, so that there was a yi 
-- and he -- he recalled -- I reme mbe r  this very 
clearly, he recalled when we were doing our join
t recollections, walking home from school with 
a bunch of his friends, and there was an old ma
n who was we aring the star and was clearly 
elderly and so forth and so on, and that the boys 
who the day before had been perfectly polite and 
passed this ma n without any even
ts happening at all, started to
 stone him. Now, you know, here 
you have this kind of institutional approval be
cause as -- you now say to everybody, we™ve 
labeled these people as unterme nschen, as dirt, 
as people that you can do anything you like with. 
I mean, it™s unfortunately a little 
bit of I think what we did in Vietnam is we socialized the 
soldiers to be willing to do unh
eard of, inhuma n things. I mean, what these guys did in My Lai 
didn™t come about because someone wanted to ha
ve a heyday. So -- so the dehumanizing effect 
that you can create, that you can 
program essentially, you can socia
lize people to participate in, 
even though their teachings and everything else 
would have you believe th
at they wouldn™t and 
shouldn™t. And happily there were people who di
dn™t, and who stood up. But then -- then you see 
then the Nazis come  in and they ma nipulate that, 
so they arrest the people who were protecting 
Jews, or they have a shooting in the square to
 basically call a
ttention to anyone who was trying 
to live up to his or her Protesta
nt or Ca tholic teachings, and no
t do this to their fellow huma n 
beings. But it™s -- it™s -- it ma kes you think abou
t how incredibly thin th
e layer of civilization 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
27 
 
really is. And when the chips are down, you 
know, the scapegoating, 
the stereotyping, the 
labeling all play one against, another against, but
 with the other, to --
 to create -- I don™t know 
what it is about us that we alwa
ys have to feel better than some
body, and in order to feel better 
we have to put some one else down. And that
™s what they were successfully doing. 
Q: Do -- do you reme mb er any other instance 
before you go into hiding where some body calls 
you a dirty Jew, or uses an epithet, or -- or 
is that the one incide
nt that you recol -- 
A: No, it™s really the one incident that I do 
reme mber. I d-don™t know whether my sister had 
more. It™s the only incident I reme mber before 
the war. The next one that I reme mber actually 
came after I came to America and went to elementa
ry school, and I was -- I was always a bit of 
an activist I guess, and I was anxious
 to fit in and blend in and do all the things that  all the ot her 
kids do, and lose my accent and learn to play base
ball and all those kinds of things. But I was on 
the safety patrol, and so I was -- my job was to 
see that the little kids got on the bus first and 
weren™t trampled by the big kids
, and all that stuff on the school
 bus. And -- and I reme mber I 
was in sixth grade by then, andthere was a boy who was trying to
 sneak into line and get on the 
bus and I yanked him out and said 
he couldn™t do this, or whatever
, whatever, he had to let the 
little kids go first. And he tu
rned around and he called me  a di
rty Jew. He was a classmate of 
mi ne. That was my first experience with it in America. 

Q: Did you respond? 

A: I don™t reme mber. I don™t really reme mber. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And of c ourse, then you get in -- then you ge
t caught up into some thing else which is by the 
time you™re 12 years old and you get the me ssage th
at you don™t want to 
be a squealer and you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496

don™t want to this and that and 
the other. And I don™
t think I responded, and 
I don™t think I told 
anybody. But I don™t remember. 
Q: Mm-hm. Right. Your father 
is arrested and doesn™t come  
back. And it™s 1942, so you™re now 
six -- 

A: It™s -- n-n-n-no, it™s not 1932 -- 

Q: It™s not -- it™s not th -- 

A: -- it™s 1942, it™s -- 

Q: 1942, no? 

A: W -- did you say? 

Q: ™42, I thought. 

A: F -- ™42, yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: It™s 1942.  
Q: Do you reme mber? 
A: I do remember because I reme mber it so di stin
ctly, and at first I thought that it was maybe in 
my me mory that had been clouded over or colore
d by the nature of the events. But that was in 
fact not the case because it™s been corroborated th
at in fact it was twilight . It was early evening, 
and again that™s sort of not a time  when you expect people to come  to the door. A-Again, I -- I 

some ti me s think about these things much -- muc h 
-- I mean way after the f
act in the sense that 
when I first reme mbered that -- th
 -- or any of these experiences, 
I didn™t reme mber them with all 
of the stuff that I bring to it now, which is to say,
 lord, just think about the mi nds that devised all 
these schemes. So usually by the time you thi
nk you™re -- you know, you™re
 in the evening, and 
unless you™re expecting company you sort of thi
nk you™re safe inside your house. Well -- and I

think this wa s the first time that he was called up
 by these Ge stapo that was in the evening. The -
- the other time s had all been daylight. So th
ey came  in the evening and they knocked on the 
door, and I reme mber -- I think I was some where 
not far behind, watching the scene. And they 
asked for my father very politely, and they said 
to my mother, ﬁ We™ll be back for you later.ﬂ And 
to this day, I think and think of -- about this, and 
I keep asking myself, were these soldiers trying 
to give my mother the high sign?  We re they tr
ying to give her an opportunity to do some thing?  
Were they ineffective and inefficient Nazis a
nd slipped, and shouldn™t ha
ve said that? You know, 
what -- what was going on here in the mi nds of these guys?   

Q: Right. 

A: I™ll never know. 

Q: I™m going to continue asking you about this, but
 we have to change 
the tape, unfortunately. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Are -- were you surmising that these were Na
zis, or they were Dutch soldiers who came?  
A: Oh, definitely not Dutch soldiers. 
Q: They were def -- they were definitely -- 

A: There were no s -- to my knowledge there were
 no soldiers in Dutch uniform around at this 
time. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The -- the capitulization -- capi
tulization of the Dutch to the N
azis, as I understood it -- and 
I™ve only just recently begun to look 
at this, because for so many year
s, I felt this was not an area 
I wanted to study, this was not an area I wanted 
to look at as a scholar and so forth. Now, I™m 
beginning to have a little differe
nt sense, and -- and actually for 
a number of reasons. But a -- as I 
understood it, it was some where around this time  th
at -- that the Dutch governme nt basically was 
a sort of government under the aeg
is of a Dutch -- a -- no, I thi
nk it was a Dutch Nazi general 
some  -- some sort of person like that, name d Se
yss-Inquart, who was basi
cally put in charge, 
where the -- whereas the queen -- I 
guess the queen and the -- and 
the royalty wasn™t  exactly the 
ruling figure anyway, given the Dutch combina
tion of a constitutional monarchy, and so on. But 
the queen left for England and the prince and prin
cess and their children left for Canada. And -- 
and actually later on I-I reme mber hearing some  
broadcasts of the queen speaking to us from 
England and so on. But so this -- this -- putting 
this person in charge again, was -- was one of 

these pi eces that I didn™t -- I wasn
't  aware of at the time. I me
an, what does a little kid know 
about governme nt and how it operates?  I didn™t 
know where the rules were comi ng from that 
were being asked -- well, were being laid down. 
I knew that there was something about the fact 
that we were not any longer having lots of red, 
white and blue flags out, and orange streamers on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
31 
 
the flag poles, which all represented Holland an
d the House of Orange. I don™t reme mber seeing 
Nazi flags either, but I didn™t s
ee the Dutch flags. And -- and it 
was again one of these ways of 
ma king things seem like they were normal. So there was a governme nt and it was issuing 
decrees, and this was a Dutch, presumably -- th
-there was a fair amount of collusion among the 
Dutch. Something that only has come  to my kno
wledge somewhat from t he experiences I had, 
but much more -- more real when I became an adu
lt and read a little bit mo
re, and heard a little 
bit more, because I™d always grown up thinki
ng, you know, the Dutch were so wonderful, and 

the Dutch basically saved me , and my
 sister and my mother. And they did that also to some  other 
Jews. But there was also a lot of collusion goi
ng on. The NSB was -- the NSB was known as the 
party that was in collusion with 
the Nazis. And it was -- i-it wa
s probably a way in which -- in 
which all politics and occupation works, and 
which uncomfortably I™m aware of, the United 
States does likewise, which is
 you find your way in to some  
society by a group of people with 
whom you a ssociate and with whom you vision a 
common goal and you infiltrate, basi cally. And 
so the -- the amount of c ollusion 
there was rather shockingly high, 
from my perspective. Not one 
I™m tremendously proud of. Holland, on the other 
hand, has had a long, hist
orical tradition of 
religious fr eedom, going back to William of Oran
ge, and was probably al so one of the reasons 
that the Jews found receptive gr ound and recepti
ve society, because they fled from so many 
places of persecution, including Spain. So -- and ac
tually my -- my grandparents, my father™s 

parents came -- now I don™t 
know if they directly or their parents came  up from Spain, but then 
actually that™s something that I™m
 hoping at some point to get 
back to The Netherlands and do 
some  of that research, because Holland and all ot
her countries besides the U.S. have, of course, 
this incredible record keeping 
and docume nts, archive stuff going back to the Middle Ages, and 
so I™m hoping to do some of that research myself. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496

Q: Right. Now, when -- when you reme mber back to
 that twilight when your father wa s taken, y-
yi -- do you -- you reme mber these soldiers as bei
ng, or gestap -- we don™t know what they are, 
you don™t th -- what th-they are. 
A: I think they were Gestapo, yeah. 

Q: You think they were Gestapo. They were polit
e with your father, so 
they weren™t rough with 
him?  

A: They very -- with -- these me n, in my recoll
ection were polite, theywere soft-spoken, they 
were not m -- you know th -- a -- I don™t reme mbe r  
at that particular ti
me  whether there was a 
heil Hitler associated with
 the interaction. I don™t 
reme mber if it was German or Dutc h at that 
time. I do reme mber at other times that it wa
s German. And I do reme mbe r  at other time s -- a-
and this is some thing now again, I can™t swear 
to. I don™t remember now 
whether I really heard 
this, or whether my current knowledge fills in th
e heil Hitler, I don™t know, but I am pretty sure 
that some of those other times when he was arre
sted, I did hear it. I don™t reme mber it the night 
that he was arrest ed this time.  

Q: Did he say goodbye to you when he was arrested, do you reme mber? 

A: I don™t think so. O-Or if he
 did it was probably -- again, I don™
t know if this was because he, 
as a parent he was trying not to create greater 
anxiety, or because he r
eally thought he mi ght be 
comi ng back again, the way he always had in
 these past times. But I don™t reme mber it. 
Q: But -- so does he leave with anything, or
 he simply leaves 
-- he just goes out? 
A: He just goes out. 

Q: He just goes out. So the door closes, and your
 mother now ma kes a very radical decision. And 
what is that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
33 
 
A: Well, in retrospect, I don™t 
know how radical it was, but she 
basically grabbed a bag, and I 
still reme mb er the looks of the bag, it was so
rt of a yucky brown, n-no -- not an attractive bag, 
but some  sort of satchel [indeciph
erable] satchel of some  sort of 
plastic or leather, or some thing, 
and throws in a hairbr ush, and a toothbrush and -- for each of us, grabs our jackets, take s us by 
the hand and walks out the door, literally walks out
 the door and closes the door behind her. And 
we walked -- a -- a -- and we -- she -- we had to
 come  down steps, it 
was up a couple steps, and 
we came down s -- and walked into the street and 
I reme mbe r  being aware of
 the fact that it was 
curfew, because Jews were not allowe d on the str
eet, because there was a curfew. They were not 
allowed on the trolleys, they were not allowed in
 the librar ies, they were not allowed in the 
parks. Alla -- aya -- they we
re not allowed in school. And -- 
and these decrees, by the way, were 
not given all at once, they were
 -- this is why I keep remi nding 
m- myself and others about the 
mi nd that was operating to keep upping the ante, to
 keep this level of norma lcy, but just enough 
fear and enough intrusion into th
e way of life that it was clear who was in charge. So one decree 
would be about you can™t use the libraries, and 
you -- so you say to yourself, well, alright, we 
can get along without the libra
ry. Next time it™s the park. We ll, you know, we™ll play in the 
backyard, we  go -- we won™t take walks. So it 
-- always it™s al so so
me how to contain the 
population you™re affecting, by ma king them adjust
 all the time . And -- 
and that adjustme nt, 
which is again some thing that if I -- if I can I 
may come back to later,
 but it™s -- on the one hand, 
it™s a peculiar character
istic of us huma ns, that we can adju
st to an incredible amount of stuff 
before we say stop. And in one sense we should ha
ve said stop right ther
e, and we should have 
risen up and we should have said we won™t take 
this. And of course there were efforts at doing 
that, sporadically here and there. But by and large, 
the effect of this layering is to keep the people 
from not boiling the waters, and doing what I th
ink Jewish populations have done since time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
34 
 
imme morial as guests in new societies, which is
 to say, well, you know, if we do what they ask, 
if we just comply with what people are asking 
us to do, then they™ll l
eave us alone. But they 
didn™t leave us alone. And so that
™s -- that al ways is somethi
ng that come s to my mi nd when 
things happen, and I say, well should we accept this, 
or should we stand up and fight right here? 
And it a -- and one of these things happened in 
my town in Massachusetts where the question 
came should we ma ke a noise about this or should
 we not. And -- and the general feeling of the 
Jewish community was led by the rabbi, which wa
s, w-w-well, you know, we™ll just let this go 

by kind of thing. And mine, s -- muc h to my su
rprise, cause I™m not n
ecessarily a person who 
ma kes wave s, but I said this is wrong. It™s not 
right, and we should be --
 here in America we 
should be calling attention to the 
fact that this is wrong. But anyw
ay, the effect of this layering, 
as I say, was -- w-was t-to keep people in comp
liance, and to, at the same time instill this 
modicum of fear and anxiety. A
nd -- and I -- I -- I don™t know what
 my father™s feeling was at 
that point when he was taken away. I don™t know wh
ether he himself had an 
inkling that this was 
different, or whether he really 
did think he was comi ng back, or
 -- I -- I -- I re
ally don™t know 
what they thought, and whether this
 is a question of radical beha
vior on my mother™s part, yes 
and no, and it™s pr obabl y a dual answer because as
 we walked across the city, and I longingly 
looking at the trolleys, I reme mber that cause I wa s 
little kid and I was tire
d and I wanted to ride. 
And the trolleys, I reme mber this eerie feeling 
as the trolleys were going by and I was -- they 
were totally empty. There would be one person sitt
ing in the trolleys, beca
use -- not that -- that  
the non-Jews  weren™t allowed on the trolleys, but 
the general tenor in the -- in the country was 

beginning to be much more concerned and so 
people weren™t out going to the theater and doing 
stuff. And I reme mber us walking through the ar
chway of the Rijksmuseum, which is a gorgeous 

Victorian building with all its towers and spires 
and so forth and part of
 it is arched over a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
35 
 
roadway which at that time still had the old fash
ioned heavy cobblestones that were like little 
mi niature hills, each one of them
. And our steps were re-echoing in
 that archway as we walked 
through, and I reme mber feeling a certain amount of
 fear. Cause I knew we were not supposed to 
be out. And I knew that my mother was afraid a
nd that she was anxious and we had to hurry and 
we had to be quiet. And I knew th
at we couldn™t help ourselves, 
there was this cl atter of the 
footsteps. And so the sense that somebody mi ght
 be comi ng for us, or comi ng after us was 
definitely there, in -- in my h
ead at that time , be cause I reme
mber the feeling. I didn™t know why, 
but I had the feeling. I knew that 
we were leaving and that we  we
re going some place else and we 
-- we -- the -- where we lived was called Amst
erdam South, it was the southern part of the 
country, and -- o-of the city, a
nd we went to Ams t erdam We st
, which was across town, through 
the western part, which was a 
much more commercial area. 
Q: So that™s a big walk? 

A: It™s a big walk. We ll, for a 
little girl it was a big walk. I™m
 not sure it™s a horrendous walk 
now. I -- I don™t exactly know how far it is. 

Q: So you™ve never retraced it? 

A: I™ve never exactly retraced it, no. I™ve been 
to both neighborhoods again, but I don™t think I 
ever walked it again.  

Q: Did your mother, when she was packing th
is bag, say, we™re leaving? An-And do you recall 
that it happened very quickly
 once the door was closed? 

A: It happened very quickly once the -- 

Q: It did. 

A: -- door was closed. I sort of almost reme mber 
her giving us the jackets,
 and the fact that we 
were leaving. How she did that, I don™t know, but 
I think I knew we were leaving right away. I-I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
36 
 
don™t think we even stopped to 
go to the bathroom. I [indeciphera
ble] you always do what little 
kids are told to do before you go out. But it was ju
st -- my recollection is there was no time to be 
lost. I mean, ma ybe she knew what these soldiers
 were trying to do. Maybe they were really 
good people and trying to give he
r the high sign. I don™t know.  
Q: But clearly, she probably had never heard the 
words, we™ll come  back for you later. Whatever 
they were doing. Either they were really goi
ng to come  back, or they were warning her. 
A: Right. 

Q: Or they were just inco
mpetent, who knows?  But she ma
y not have ever heard it. 
A: And -- that™s right. 
I don™t think they ever said it at any 
other time . I think any other time it 
was a much more kind of belliger ent, we™re comi ng to take you to -- down to the st ation for 

questioning, stuff. And questioning I -- I -- wi -- I 
have to ask my sister, but I have no idea what 
this questioni ng was about. 

Q: Questioning was about.  
A: I didn™t -- 
Q: We ll, you also don™t know who your father wa s. 

A: Y-You mean -- 

Q: A-As a -- 

A: -- what else he mi ght have been up to? 

Q: If -- as a -- [indecipherable] yeah. 

A: That™s true. We ll, that™s true
, and of course there was this 
whole other activity that was going 
on, that I only learned about later,
 which was -- we ll, some  of wh
ich I n -- I was aware of, which 
is that everybody had to have identity cards, and 
the Jewish ones had a big J stamped on it. And I 
also knew, and I -- this was before, I believe be
fore my father was taken, that a friend of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
37 
 
family, who was a mi nister, actually provided 
us with fake baptism papers. Because -- I-I 
reme mber that at the time, and I remember sort 
of hearing about it, and 
perhaps even be -- being 
given one of those t-to have on my person. And of 
course, initially it was, 
I think as I mentioned, 
first when they started doing the calling up of Jews 
-- fi rst of all, they also
 instituted another one 
of their pieces of ma dness. Th
ey started this thing called Jo
ods Raad, which was basically 
translated as the Jewish councils. They -- th
ey took various l-leaders within the Jewish 
community and created a kind of a 
self governance piece, so that e
ssentially they gave them the 
orders of what they wanted done, and they ma de
 them responsible for 
carrying it out. So now 
what you™re doing is you™re creating this horrendo
us thing between people of the same  ma rked, 
steri -- stigmatized group
 and saying, you do the dirty work, y
ou choose who™s going to be called 
up next. You are the ones thatpromulgates the decrees of n-not
 -- no access of the schools and 
this and that and the other. So the Jewish counc
ils were having to do this to their own people. 
And the -- the -- the tendency to first of all cond
emn these people roundly, I think is very great, 
because you™re sayi ng, you know, what the hell were
 you doing tell -- sending us off to the -- be 
slaughtered. By the same  token, I 
don™t think they were 
all doing it from that 
perspective. I think 
some  of them were doing it because, as I said befo
re, they thought that well, if we just comply 
with that they™re asking, and ma ybe I can help to k
eep my people sort of 
understanding that if we 
just keep calm and do what they ask, we can get 
through this all right. I th
ink they were doing it 
from that perspective, some of
 the m. I think others probably we
re doing it to save their own 
skins, sort of either realizi
ng whatever was happening it wasn
™t good, but if they volunteered to 
do this, then ma ybe they
 would not have to go. And I have to say that, comi ng through this 
experience, I don™t think any of us
 is ever able to say what we
 would or would not do under any 
circumstances such as these. I don™t think you 
know what you™re capable of doing, I don™t think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
38 
 
you know what you™re capable of tolerating, I don™t 
think you™re cap -- yo-you have any sense of 
the reality of w-what you mi ght do if you or your fa
mily me mbers were under 
siege or in peril of 
losing their lives. I just
 think it™s impossible. 
Q: D-Do you reme mber the ce
rtificate?  W- We re you -- 
A: Vaguely, I -- I -- 
Q: -- actually carry -- you 
think you were carrying it? 
A: I don™t know if I was carrying 
it or whether my parents had th
em, to be able to produce them. 
But the reason for these certificates also was that in
itially -- oh, I guess I lost
 track of the flow of 
this, initially they called up the refugees fr om eas
tern Europe and deported 
those, and ma de nice 
space available in We sterbork and so forth, and 
then they bega n to deport various among the 
Jews. Now who they were and why these people 
were chosen, I don™t know. And I don™t know if 
perhaps my father was instrume ntal in perhaps 
helping other people get pa
pers or something like 
that, I don™t know. This went -- 
first they started calling up th
e people who were full blooded 
Jews. And then, when there were no more of 
those -- and of course, you say, or you mi ght say, 
how did they know who those people were?  We ll, th
is is where this incredible record keeping. 
All they had to do was go to the municipal offices
 and get the birth record
s and the this and the 
that and the other. And -- and they did that. They
 did an incredible amount of this kind of spade 
work. So they would s -- first call up the ones w
ho were hundred percent Jewish, and then they 
would call up the people who were 75 percent Je
wish. And then they would call up the people 
who were 50 percent Jewish. And then they would call up the people who had -- the one ha-half 

of a couple who had intermarried, and they would l
eave the others. And this 
-- this is what gave 
rise to the papers. Could you show that you had 
not -- no -- were no longer
 Jewish?  But it didn™t 
help, because after awhile they said it didn™t c
ount, that -- you know, at firs
t, yes, they™d leave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
39 
 
you alone, cause now you were not Jewish. But then they would say, anybody who was born 
Jewish. I mean they just -- 

Q: But yo -- but your parents had 
a certain kind of foresight -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- about the situation -- 

A: I -- 

Q: -- that you didn™t know, at th -- certainly 
didn™t know at the time, because you just -- 
A: Ah, I certainly di d not know at the time. I didn™t know, for example, until much, mu ch later, 

that my uncle, my mother™s brother had come  fr
om Vienna, and had fled Vienna and come  to 
Amsterdam in order to take the boat to go to Am
erica. And this is the story I heard from hi m 
once we came to the United States, that he talked 
to my fol ks and urged them to leave, and urged 

them to drop everything and just 
come, and they didn™t want to go. 
Q: And this was before the Nazi occupation? 
A: This would have had to be before -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- because he couldn™t have 
gotten out, nor could they have gotten out. And apparently it was 
my mother who didn™t want to go, at
 least that™s my recollection of
 the way this was told. And I -
- I could be wrong about that, bu
t -- and I often thought about this
 afterwards, and I thought, why 
would she not want to go when this was on th
e horizon?  And I think it was just such an 
incredible disbelief that this would ever. I mea
n, it™s like so ma ny things
 that face us, and you 
kind of think, no, I mea n it™s -- it
™s probably just in human natu
re that you ke -- you have to 
either get your head in the wave rolling over you,
 or you have to be enormously courageous, or 
maybe a little bit cr azy, or even stupid by some 
people™s judg me nt, to drop everythi ng, to drop 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
40 
 
this good job that she had, to
 leave this lovely hous
e and all the -- the materi
al things and take off 
for no ma n™s la -- I mean, America?  [indecipherab
le] not that it was no ma n™s land, in fact she 
had an uncle I know who came back and brought her 
s -- her brother some  gifts and brought her 
some  things from the United States and so on. 
So she knew about the United States. But she 
apparently said no, but then my father -- so the story goes, my father who took my uncle to the 

boat, apparently said to him, 
if anyt hing ever happens to us, 
will you see to my children? And, 
you know, I™ve heard this story repe
ated from my uncle, and then 
also from my sister, but I 
didn™t know about it. So if there 
was some thing pre-thought, or pr
edicted, or anticipated, it must 
have come  from both the news and reading wh
at happened around Europe and this was comi ng 
closer and closer, and then actua
lly having my father arrested. S
o, between my brother fleeing -- 
my -- her brother, my mother™s brother fl
eeing, and saying to his 
sister, why don™t you drop 
everything and come , and the actual
 things that happened after he 
left, they must have done some  
things, including the fact that when we finally
 ended up at the home where we -- where we were 
hidden for the war, and led into the baseme nt, 
there in the baseme nt were two beds that I 
recognized as having come from 
my home, and a quilt and some bl
ankets that I knew were from 
home. So -- 
Q: So you haven™t noticed that 
they were not in your house? 
A: No, I didn™t notice that 
they were mi ssing at all. 
Q: Oh. 

A: Had not registered this at all. We ll, one of 
them was a trundle, and it
 was the bottom part of 
the piece that would have gone under some thing. So
 that mi ght be easy to mi ss. I™m not sure 
where the other bed came from. I did not ever mi ss 
it, I didn™t see it going 
out of the house. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
41 
 
that must have been some doing cause it came  off the first floor of the house, it had had to go 
down the stairs, it had to be trucke
d. I-I don™t know when that happened. 
Q: Right. I think that™s what I mean when I say 
that™s a kind of radical move, because while your 

mother was not willing to leave to go to Americ
a, she saw some thing as soon as your father -- 
that was a real arrest . 

A: Yeah, I think so. 

Q: And she knew she had to leave, and -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- they -- she didn™t leav
e for nowhere. She knew ex
actly where she was going. 
A: Where she was going. And she 
mu st have done some thing to prepare for that eventuality. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I have no idea when those beds we
nt there, because I never saw them go. 
Q: Right. 
A: I don™t know whether they were there right afte
r my uncle left for America, when they could 
still move stuff without alerting anybody. 
Q: Right. 

A: Whether they were clandestin
ely moved in the mi ddle of the ni
ght and I was asleep. No idea. 
None. And the interesting thing a
bout those things that were there also, was -- I mean there was 
no question that this quilt was from our house, and -- then of course th
ere were three of us 
sharing these two beds then. There was some thing 
else there that I recognized. Upstairs in the 
lower shelves of the buffet were 
not only some  staples that had b
een put there, which apparently 
my folks had been responsible for putting there, th
ere was also my mother™s best china. It was a 
beautiful set of china that I adored. It was sort 
of an ivory colored Rose
nthal china with little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
42 
 
roses on it. And I thought it was simply beautiful.
 And here my mother has chosen, of all the 
ma terial things, to bring 
that china. Not with her 
when we fled there -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- but obviously at some  point beforehand. 

Q: And again, you hadn™t noticed that that china was not in your house, or at least ma ybe she had 

some  pieces, so you wouldn't be confused. 

A: It™s not some thing we used 
every day, it was only sort of -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- for those special couple of 
big dinners that I reme mber.  
Q: Wa s this walking, do you reme mb er, was it an 
a -- I mean, could you even think about that?  
Was it an hour, was it two hour
s?  A half hour?  Do you -- 
A: No sense. 

Q: No sense, right. 
A: It seemed an -- 
Q: Interminable -- 

A: It seemed an eternity. 

Q: -- yes. 

A: It seemed interminable. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was much longer than I wanted to be wa
lking. It was dark, it was clearly not any longer 
twilight , it was really dark, ther e were st -- there 
were the lights of the tram that I reme mber. I™m 

thinking to myself how ghostly it wa s 
because they were all so empty. 
Q: And you were holding onto 
your mother™s hand, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
43 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- your mother was holding both of the kids. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And also carrying th
is little bag. You -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- neither one of you were carryin
g anything, as far as you reme mber? 
A: Not in -- that I recollect. Not that I re
m -- m- maybe my sister was, but I don™t know.  

Q: We re you walking fast? 

A: Yes, you -- we were walking fast. Ve
ry -- it was very business-like -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- very quickly. A-And that probably also gave 
rise to my feeling of ur
gency, the fact that -- I 
never thought about that, actuall
y, til you asked that. But yes, we-well we were not sort of 
ambling, by any means. We were very purposeful. 
And I think she was walking as quickly as she 
could make me walk. 

Q: And she knew, obviously -- y-you didn™t know this, but she knew exactly where she was 

going. 

A: Yes, no question. 

Q: She ma y have known the shor
test route to get there. 
A: She ma y well have. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean, for all I know, there was only one, bu
t she -- a-and ma ybe it 
wasn™t the shortest, 
ma ybe it™s the one that mi ght be 
le-least causing some body t o see us. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
44 
 
A: I don™t know. I-I -- I don™t know. 
Q: And this noise that you were
 hearing, was this only around the 
Rijksmuseum, or we re -- there 
are a lot of cobblesto
nes in Amsterdam. 
A: Ah, you™re right. I think it was only because
 the cobblestone -- walking in the archway, re-

echoed in that enclosed space. 

Q: Uh-huh, right, right. 

A: So I was aware of both the sound as well 
as the echo of the s
ound, which I didn™t hear 
elsewhere. 

Q: We ll, we™re going to stop the tape and then 
we™ll start with your goi
ng into this house. So 
let™s stop the tape. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape Three

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Hedy, did your mother ever carry you in this tr
ip, or you just -- you wa lked and ran to get to 
this house?  
A: I-I don™t reme mber her carrying me at all, no, if 
my recollection is right, h-he -- I am six years 
old. 

Q: Right. 

A: So probably a little bit big for carrying. And 
I do have a recollection, ac
tually, of my mother 
and my sister carrying me  in some  previous year
 when we we re on vacation in what I think was 
Scheveningen, which is the beach resort town not too far from Amsterdam. And for some  reason 

my dad wasn™t either with us, or wasn™t on this 
walk with us or whatev
er. And I got a thorn or 
some thing stuck in my foot, and I was complain
ing and ma king lots of unpleasant noises, I™m 
sure. And my sister and mother ma de a little 
seat for me  by crossing their hands like this, you 

know, in four -- with four ways around, and carried 
me . So I™ m sure that if I felt the need to be 
carried, I would have said some thing. And 
I have no recollection of her carrying me . 
Q: Of carrying you. 

A: Or the two of them ca rrying me . 

Q: Do you reme mber when you came to the house, where you were going to go in? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you know what happened?  Reme mber? 

A: I -- I do reme mber comi ng -- all three of us so
rt of huddling into this -- when we came to the 
street, the Jan Evertsenstraat, which I was not 
familiar with, I d-don™t th
ink I™d ever been to 
before. And this s-street was diffe
rent from my street, in that 
it was clearly a some what  later 
period when it was built, because the housing was 
very much the same in the sense that the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
46 
 
houses were up tight against each othe r, there wa
s not space in between. And it -- they went all 
the way around the block, and it was a house floor a
nd first, second and third apartment. But the 
house floor in this case, was the store, was th
e commercial establishment. And it had a store 
window. And so there wa s a portico between two st
ores, and in that port
ico, you had first of all 
the -- on the left side the store 
entrance, then you had 
another entrance that went to the three 
apartments upstairs, and then you had another apar
tment entrance for the thr
ee apartments in this 
side, and another st ore door that went into this
 place, which we now entered. And the store was a 
liquor store. And it turned out that my mo m a
nd my sister, which I now know, knew this person 
who opened the door. 
Q: Your sister knew th
e person [indecipherable] 
A: My sister also knew her, but I don™t think sh
e knew of these preparatio
ns. I don™t think so. In 
any case, we were basically whisked inside and --
 a-and shown to -- throu
gh the stor e, into the 
back of the store, which was sort of -- these peopl
e were of very modest means, they we re people 
who were living in back of the store, which 
was not usually what people did. They had an 
apartment someplace else in town, or  perhaps upst
airs above the stor e, but they tended not to 
have as their permanent residenc
e, the little bitty living spaces in
 the back of th
e ha -- of the 
store. And when we came to the back of the stor e,
 and went out of the actu
al store pa rt, there was 
a little, small sort of in-between room, and in 
one end of the wall there 
was -- it™s -- it™s often 
spoken of as a typical Dutch arrangeme nt with th
e bed inside the wall. And in that recessed bed 
was a much elderly man, and much older than
 the woma n, and it was her husband, and he was 
also ailing in some way, I don™t remember exac
tly what. And -- and his name  was Uncle John, I 
mean he wa s referred to as onc -- ome -- ome -- 
Oome  Sjon. And then w-we were shown another 
door, and the door led down into the baseme nt. A
nd we went down the stairs in the baseme nt, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
47 
 
and there was a baseme nt that ran all the way fr
om underneath the storefro
nt, all the way to the 
backyard. And in the part underneath the storef
ront, this is how modestly, if not poor these 
people were, their only son had a curtained off area 
that was his room, his place. And there were 
very few ma terial things there, 
or  anyplace else in the house. And 
then we turned to go towards 
the part that was closest to the backyard, and to
 these two sort of rece
ssed, if you will, windows. 
I mean, it was sort of like -- I guess it™s what 
you call a bulkhead, out in 
the yard. And instead of 
a door there were these glass windows. But it meant 
that there was a sort of sunken well with -- 
with -- with some  iron bars acro
ss the top where people st epped i-
in the yard. And -- and the only 
way to get any light or air would 
be to open those. And of course, it rains a lot in Holland as it 
did then, and these wells would fill up with water,
 up to the top practically, and we had to -- I 
reme mber we took turns trying to
 siphon that out, by 
mouth, literally, to get the water out of 
those things so that we could open them and have
 some  air. But anyway, when we came into this 
cellar and we nt towards the yard part, that™s wher
e I saw two beds covered in quilts and blankets, 
or a quilt and -- and blanket that 
I reme mbered from my home. So th
at™s when it first regi stered 
on me , even at that young age, that some how this
 was part of what the grown-ups had in mi nd, 
some thing that they™d already planned. And that fi
rst night we just went to bed, that I reme mber. 
Q: Did -- did this woma n ex -- do you think your mother called her before you left?  Cause she 

clearly was not surprised when you came.  

A: No -- 

Q: Cause you just -- 

A: -- she wasn™t surprised. I don™t 
know. I really -- I have no reco
llection and I have also very 
little recollection of th
e use of the telephone th
e way we have it today. 
Well, never mi nd today, 
but even some  years ago, it just -- y -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
48 
 
Q: But you had one? 
A: I don™t even know that. 

Q: Ah. 

A: I don™t even know that. 

Q: And who knows if this person had it, so I don™t -- 

A: Likely not. Likely not. I don™t remember any us
e of the telephone in either family at any time, 
so it™s very possible there wasn
™t one. And -- and I -- I do rememb
er that there was no qu -- I -- I 
can™t say that we were expected, but it was sort 
of -- y -- she opened the door very quickly, and 
sort of very quickly saw us insi
de and closed the door. And then 
in the next few days, we were 
down in the baseme nt and we were -- the stor
e was still operating, so the store was open and 
there were people comi ng and going and so on. A
nd -- and the -- the woma n of the house, whose 
name  was Katoos Koolhaas Revers, who we calle
d Tante Toos, or cut -- 
it™s a short form of 
Katoos, and tante, of course, 
is aunt. And she took care of th
e infirm husband, and the young son, 
who was a few years older than my sister, so a 
teenager, and -- and the st
ore, as long as it ran. 
And we were in the baseme nt and then for a fairly short period of time, we were, every few days 

or so, were allowed to kind of come  up in the yard
 and sit and have a cup of tea or some thing, for  
a short while, as if to say to the neighbors who mi
ght have been looking in from three sides of 
this bloc k, if you reme mber how I spaced this out, who mi ght have been wondering who were 

these people that were suddenly over there. So we
 looked like visitors, or
 we were trying to act 
like visitors. And during this period there were st
ill lots of people on this commercial street. 
Every day the stores would open, and of c
ourse you had your butcher
 and baker and gr-
greengrocer, and stationary store. I mean, you didn™t
 go to the ma rket there, th -- you we nt to the 

individual stores, and you didn™t 
have supermarkets, certainly, 
or grocery stores. And -- well, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
49 
 
you, yes you had grocery stores, but they only dea
lt with, let™s say, dry good and so on. So at 
first it was decided that -- th
at it was okay for me  to go out and meet -- mi x and mi ngle with the 
crowd because I -- and this is when I heard it sa
id, that I looked the least Jewish. Now, what did 
that mean?  Uh-huh, and my guess is that since my 
sister is some what darker haired than I am, 

and also older, and mi ght have been less comfor
table pretending to be some one she wasn™t, they 
thought it was okay for me  to get out there and play
 and then just pretend that I was visiting an 
aunt, in case I was stopped. And this was also 
when I was supposed to be some body other than 
Hedy Cohen, which was, of course, my ma iden name
, and in -- and I was drilled, actually, before 
being allowed out, to say that my name  was 
Hedy Vermeulen, and that I lived at, you know, 
some  other place, but that I was visiting my a
unt over here. That stopped fairly soon, that I 
wasn™t allowed to go out any more. 

Q: Weeks, months, days?  Do
 you have any recollection? 
A: I think weeks, but I certainly 
don™t think it was months. In -- 
Q: It was very dangerous for these people to keep you in the house. 
A: Oh, extremely dangerous, and there was a l-lot 
of -- and I didn™t notice at the time, but having 

talked to my  sister  about this in the meantime,
 there apparently was a lot of fa mily dissension 
about the fact that she had agreed to do this. 
And she apparently had a brother who was openly 

and outspokenly against it, and told her that 
she should just, you know, turn us in, that she 
couldn™t do this and shouldn™t do this and 
so on. And some how she prevailed. And -- and 
actually, when you asked before -- or ma ybe you di
dn™t ask, but I said some
thing about this -- the 
business of the yards, and people be
ing able to see. At this time
 the Nazis were doing some thing 
else which is actually pretty well docume
nted in -- in what™s his name , Wyma n™s book. 
Q: David Wyma n? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
50 
 
A: David Wyma n™s book where he ac
tually has photographs of th
ese -- these broadsides that 
would be appearing on corner kiosks and so 
forth, of which there were ma ny, and it would 
announce things like rewards for a
ny tips that would lead to th
e arrest of some one who was 
either harboring Jews, or who was seen consor
ting with Jews, or who knew of Jews who were 
some place or other. So the business of being see
n, and the business of being in the yard, and the 
bi -- i-it -- it was a tremendous 
danger not just for us, but for the fa mily who was sheltering us. 
And so this proved to be an enormous burden 
for -- for -- not only for 
the people who were doing 
the hiding but the people who were being hidden, to
 the point that  ther e is a lot of evidence of 
people who apparently couldn™t to
lerate putting this kind of dange
r on the people they loved, and 
they would get themselves arrest
ed. They would either run out dur
ing a search, a
nd run into the 
street some where far away from the house that they
 had been in. And they were usually shot, or 
rounded up, or brought in or what
ever. But that was not an in
frequent phenomenon, because it 
was so terrible to -- everybody knew what was going 
to happen. And then the rewards were such 
that, I mean, when you think of the pettiness of, 
you know, some thing the equivalent of a dollar, 
or five dollars, would be the reward if you could 
give the Nazis a tip that would lead to some  
arrests or other. And people were out doing this. 
They were out trying to 
collect these rewards. 
And you didn™t know who would and who wouldn™t. 
So -- and in some  cases I know it happened 
within families where -- and this mi ght have been
 the case here, but it wasn™t, where the brother 
was so opposed to having his sister do 
this. But, to our knowledge he never --  
Q: He never did anything. 
A: He never did a
nything about it. 
Q: Once you are not allowed outside, because they
 were concerned, that meant you were inside 

for a few ye ars. Couple years. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
51 
 
A: Right. 
Q: Right?  

A: Well, was all told about th-t hree and a half. 

Q: Three -- three and a ha lf years. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Wh- Wha t was Tante Toos like?   

A: Well -- 

Q: Can you -- can you distinguish the -- the time when
 th -- that first year, cause unfortunately 
your mother dies in 1944. So you™re there for almo
st two years. And what is it like in the house 
with all of you?  The elderly father, Hans, the 
teenage boy, your sister, who is a teenager, your 
mother and this other woma n. And the other wo
man is younger than your mother?  Or about the 
same?  

A: Yes. No, she™s younger.  
Q: She™s younger? 
A: She™s younger. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Well, some of it actually is to be expected, 
in the sense that ma ny pe
ople have the experience 
as parents of doing some thing together with othe
r parents and there is 
a -- a disagreement about 
what youngsters can be allowed to do or not to do
. So there wa s some  of t his tension between the 
two mothers. A-About what, I don™t reme mber, do 
I have an example, no. I just knew it was 
there. And because there was such a spread in ag
es, it was also difficult. There was s -- at least 
then, before my mother died, there wa s this. Th
ere was also a kind of 
o-obvious -- and I -- and I 
have to confess that this is a thought that came  long after and not 
before. I knew there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
52 
 
tension between the two parents as mothers, and kids
 have an intuition about that stuff. But there 
was some thing else and that had to do with th
e fact that clearly my 
mo t h e r  - -  my  mo t h e r ™ s  
freedom as a  mother and a parent, and her freedom as far as objecting to and disagreements, and 
-- I mean to -- to the kinds of disagreements, wa
s severely limited because of the nature of this 
relationship. We  were totally a
nd completely dependent on this fa
mily. So my mother must have, 
ma ny, many times, been severely pressed for pati
ence and understanding and compromi se and so 
on. There was nothing she could do. I mean, basically her only alternative was to be quiet and 

acquiesce, or  to leave. And -- and clearly she surely didn™t want to do that, because there were 

the two of us also. I don™t know what she wouldhave done if it was just herself. So there was 

probably no real outlet for all that 
kind of frustration. Plus the f
act that we were getting -- we 
were getting some letters fr om my father, and th
ey c -- apparently came  from different camps as 
he was being transported from one to the other, to 
the other, and then eventually the last l-letters 
came from Auschwitz. And the letters were alwa
ys censored. They were alway -- they had 
heavy, heavy black lines drawn through writing, a
nd there was no way -- I reme mber my mother 

holding them up to the light and putting them ove
r a bright light and on -- so forth and so on. 
They could not see what was -- what was under th
at. And they came to us via a very roundabout 
route, having to do with some  of Tante Toos™s
 family. I don™t know if it was brother or brother-
in-law, or how we got some  of these 
things, but we did get these letters. 

Q: Because your father couldn't ha
ve sent them t o you directly. 
A: Exactly. 

Q: Right?  They would have had to have been se
nt -- so obviously, there are a number of people 

who know where you are. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
53 
 
Q: There™s -- there™s some  syste m going on. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And your parents must have been
 in touch not just with this 
woma n, but within a context of a 
system, no? 

A: Within context of the system, I think that  my 
mother or parents were only in touch with Tante 
Toos. I think that sh
e then did the -- 
Q: Did the rest, I see. 

A: -- next steps and so on. 

Q: I don™t know this for positive, but I sort of th
ink so. I-I -- I know that my sister has mentioned 
it several times, something of the family dyna mi
c between the brothers 
and Tante Toos and -- 
and how often there was friction because of the fact
 that they were not wa
nting the sister to do 
this and so on. Then there was another dynami c th
at took place here in 
this confined quarter. 
First of all there was probably this --  this little
 kid who was always sort of -- sort of in-between 
and in the wa y and what have you. There was 
another dynami c going on between my sister and 
the young boy, after a fairly short 
time . And every time I think about
 this whole experience, and 
as I then moved on in my life later and work
ed with young people and studied young people and 
everything else, I am always caught by the uniquene
ss of that ad-adolescent 
era that each of us 
has, but which in my sister™s case was so totally 
rent asunder, so that just
 at the point when life 
opens up for you and you™re no longer quite a ch
ild and you™re now movi ng into domains of 
knowledge and you™re beginning to have some  fe e
ling of what the world™s about, and when you 

start thinking about future and ma king plans 
and having relationships, and having groups of 
friends, and beginning to pull away 
from your -- your parental u-unit 
as the kids used to say. And 
this must have been so hard for her to have this
 cut off. Yes, I was disappointed I couldn™t go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
54 
 
school and so on, but the -- to compare that to wh
at must have happened to my sister, it must 
have been so awful, to have everything just ki
nd of collapsed, to have 
everything just sort of 
literally having the rug pulled out from under you and 
now you are in this sort
 of prison, sort of 
confinement , really. And then the knowledge that
 our very lives and futures depended on being 
able to s -- to ma ke the most of wha t  we have he
re, and to be able to get along, and to be able to 
ma ke it work. And -- and some  of this has been
 written quite beautiful
ly by Anne Frank, and -- 
where she talks about some  of these dynami cs be
tween the rescuer and the protectors, and the 
fa mily and the internal stuff. And ye
ah, there was a lot of that going on. 
Q: So was there a kind of roma nce be
tween Hans and Betsy, your sister? 
A: Yeah, I think so -- 
Q: Or the beginnings of one, yeah. 

A: -- it -- certainly the beginnings
 of one, and I think 
certainly by the time the three and a half 
years ended, there was more of it, and I think then, 
for that one year that we
 were still there after 
the war, I think there was more of it, and then 
some  knowledge of -- of 
some  new people her age 
that she -- his good friend and so forth. I th -- 
I think that this was re
ally tough. A-And I think 
there were expectations on her pa
rt when we came to America th
at this mi ght continue and it 
didn™t and she had sort of no place to go with her f
eelings. So that -- that was terribly difficult. 
Terribly difficult. And I think that the -- the sense 
on the part of Tante Toos was very -- I me an, I 
think she really -- she cared, if not imme diately, 
she certainly came  to care for us very deeply. 
And -- a-and again, as they say, afterwards, wh
en my mother died, there was a new set of 

tangents, because she felt, I think in a very real se
nse, that it was her role as the adult ma ternal 
figure, to be the caretaker and ca
regiver. I think my sister felt, 
as the person clos
est to me , and 
now the older, responsible adult, that she should be
 the one to basically kind of take the initiative 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
55 
 
about what I should do or not do a
nd what things I mi ght be critic
ized for or not, as the case ma y 
be. So there™s the tension between those two. 
Q: Between those two. 

A: During much of this time when we  were in hi
ding, again my poor sister was put to the task of 
teaching me , because here I had two weeks of sc
hool and no schooling again, 
so it was her job to 
teach me basic arithmetic and reading and writing and -- and so forth. We  -- and she di d a great 

job with that, and I™m not sure 
I could have equaled doing that, cau
se I mu st have been a real 
pain in the neck to --  to --  to deal  wi
th. And there was no television and no VCR and no 
computer, and no Ga me boy and no, you know, record pl
ayer, n-no radios, we weren™t allowed to 
have radi os, al-although we did have a radio, 
it was not permitted. Now again, really another 
example of - -  of this ma dness and planning. He
re you have a -- an occupied population and you 

cut off all their means of getting news from the outsi
de. You tell them they have to turn in all the 
radios. So this -- this clandes
tine radio virus was already a firs
t move of r e jection of these 
decrees that our host family was part of, because 
there was -- no one was allowed radios, not just  
Jews, no one. And initially there 
were -- there were beginning to
 be food shortages after the 
beginning of this time  when we were -- we 
-- we literally ducked under -- the Dutch word 
onderduiken is -- is to duck under, and that™s 
literally what we were
 doing. And -- and -- 
Q: What does that mean? 

A: Onderduiken means to duck under. 

Q: Wha -- wa -- duck under, but wa -- what
 are you ducking under?  You me an, bu -- by hiding, 
you -- 

A: We  were -- we -- we™re saying 
onderherduiken, which is we we
nt into hiding, this is how you 
would translate it -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
56 
 
Q: I see. 
A: -- but literally translated it is -- 

Q: [indecipherable] under. 

A: -- we ducked under. You know
, not necessarily what -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but the fact is that we di
d that. And initially there were ra
tion cards handed out for available 
food. And of course, instead of three people ther
e were now six people in this house. And so it 
fell to Hans to -- the young boy, to go out a
nd scour up -- I don™t know how, black market, 
whatever, to go find more ration poi
nts, and -- cards. And so he did that reasonably successfully 
until there wasn™t any more food that was hande
d out, and -- and little by 
little the shops all 
closed, one after the other, after the other, and 
had heavy wooden shutters to protect them from 

vandalism a nd people growing quite desperate fo
r food. And then for awhile they had set up 
soup kitchens, where you could come  with your ra
tion points and get potat
o peel soup and that 
came back with Hans and he would -- we would a
ll share that, of course. 
And -- and even the -- 
the liquor store now was closing, cause there was nothing, there was -- there was no more liquor 

left for the population and so th
at -- those doors closed. And there 
were bottles of colored water 
that were in the display window and so on. But 
he would go and -- and occasiona lly try to dig up 

some thing and apparently came back once with a smoked eel, one eel. And Holland™s specialty 

of course, is all versions of 
fish, of al l kinds. Smoked and pickled and you name  it. And the one 
eel was divided among s i x people. And the piece th
at I got was the one that had the head. And 
what I didn™t realize is that ther
e was a h-hook in the head, and tryi
ng to get every last morsel of 
edible food out of this thing, I got the fis
hhook stuck in my tongue. And we are now in the 
baseme nt, right, and I knew some how, don™t ask me
 how, that I shouldn™t ma ke a noise, that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
57 
 
shouldn™t scream, that I -- and ev
en that spontaneous reaction th
at you think I would have had, 
was suppressed. Which probably cam
e from by now having lots of 
times being told, don™t make 
any noise, you™ve got to keep qui
et, you can only whisper, and so on. Because for the first part of 
our hiding, the -- there wa s activity going on upsta
irs and there were people in and out of the 
store. And so we couldn™t really talk, we coul
dn't really ma ke any noises. And -- and some how I 
reme mbered this, and my mother came over and sh
e worked the fishhook out
 of my mouth and -- 
and that was that. But that -- again, how did 
I know how -- how did I c
ontrol that impulse?  I 
don™t know, I just did. You sort of wonder often a
bout how it is that you do those things as a 
small child, or a big child. I mean, 
big child I think it™s mo -- it™s a 
little easier to fi gure it out. 
When you™re a small child, you kind of say, how did that work, you know?  What was in my 
head?  And I don™t know what was in my head. I 
think I just felt it, just felt the whole 
atmosphere, the whole -- whole sense of -- ev
erything was dangerous, ev
erything about life was 
dangerous. And so you -- you kept a 
low profile and you didn™t talk
 loud and you didn™t scream 
and -- awful really, when you think about 
the effect of that on a small kid.  
Q: We  have to change the -- 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Hedy, was there a special time when your 
sister was doing home  -- essentially home 
schooling? Would she do it in the morning, or th
e afternoon, or the evening, or wasn™t there a 
particular time?  
A: I don™t have a -- any recollec
tion that there wa s a particular 
time . I don™t even remember what 
actually transpired in those sessi
ons. I don™t think that they lasted 
all of the time that we were in 
hiding, but they lasted long enough to get me  to 
be able to read. And -- and I™m sure she did 
some  -- s-see again, we ha -- we had nothing, we 
ha -- we even had no paper. You couldn™t get 
anything any more. You couldn™t get crayons, you 
couldn™t get colored -- well, we didn™t really 
have crayons like they ha ve Crayolas here. We
 had colored pe ncils and we had a few because 

when the newspapers were still being published 
-- which also stopped, but while they were being 
published we  didn™t have the comi c section lik
e you do here, but we did have one which I 
recognized later was a political 
cartoon and -- and it was on the back of the front page of De 
Telegraaf, which was the sort of -- s-sa -- probab
ly right of center newspaper. And I would cut 
out -- after people had gotten through 
with the paper, I would cut out 
this little two or three frame 
thing and -- and color it with a few colored pencil
s that we had and that™s one way I kept busy. 
And I loved these characte
rs, I thought they were just so mu
ch fun, but again, I was an animal 
lover. And this was tom poes, which was tomcat
, and Ollie B. Bommel. 
And Ollie B. Bommel 
was a bear, and he was a pretty dumb bear. And so
 it was always the smart cat who was rescuing 
him out of a wkward situations or correcting hi
s erroneous thinking. And 
so the political stuff 
kind of came through that. And th
is was my p-precious possession 
from - -  from all of those 
years, and it™s one of the few things that I had 
at the end of the war, cau
se I collected all these 
things until they stopped publishing, 
and I took them with me to Amer
ica, and I kept them in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
59 
 
attic and so forth and so on, and then at some  
later date ma ny years later when I me t my husband 
and he came to visit at the house and so forth, an
d I told him a bout this. And he said, ﬁOh,ﬂ he 
said, ﬁdo you have those around? ﬂ  
I said oh yeah, and so I brought them down from t he attic, and 
he opened the box and he grabbed them and the firs
t thing he did was flip
 them over on the other 
side, because there were the headlines of wh
at was going on during thos
e early years. And I 
haven™t tried to piece those head
lines together, but I have starte
d to do some  research now on -- 
actually on the original newspapers, to see what 
was the context within which all of my personal 
experience was taking pl ace. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Because now, as an adult, I™m interested in
 knowing -- a-and not onl
y interested in knowing, 
but I™m so appalled at some  of the things that
 you keep seeing repeated and repeated and 

repeated in history. Not the leas
t of which was these kinds of le
ft, right and so forth debates 
about how to interpret what the Nazis were doing, 
and so I actually have been looking at some  of 
the newspapers on the left, and some  of th
em on t he right and some  of the underground 
newspapers which were being publ
ished. And some  of that has pr
oven to be very interesting -- 
very interesting to read. 

Q: We re you bored? 

A: During these years? 

Q: Yeah. Or antsy, or -- 

A: Well, I -- 

Q: You know what I me an, I mean -- 

A: It -- it™s a very hard question to answer 
because on the one hand I must have been, but on the 
other hand I don™t reme mber it. Now one thing that
 I reme mber doing, I -- I know that because of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
60 
 
the severely confined circumstances in which 
we were, and if you reme mber, I me ntioned the 
fact that these people were not very we ll off in 
this little daytime place for -- for the proprietors 
of the -- of the shop, th -- but the shop was part
 of the Chrispijn liquor 
store chain. It was a big, 
well-known company, and -- and Tante Toos was the 
proprietress of this -- 
this particular one 
store. But part of what -- what was also very
 difficult is that because it was only meant for 
daytime habitation, there was only 
a little half bathroom. Ther e 
was only a toilet with a little 
teeny sink, just enough to wash your hands, as mo
st toilet rooms are in -- in Europe. An-And 
there was no shower, and there was no bathtub. So
 ma tters of hygiene had to be taken care of 
rather differently, in basins a
nd lots of hand washing and so 
on. And lots of washing, I mean. 
And also, I think what was -- I mean, this actua
lly took time, I mean you had to carry water in 
basins and bring it downstairs and so on. And I 
reme mber my mother i-
in very short order, 
decided I had to cut my -- or she was going to cu
t my long hair, cause I had long pigtails. And I 
reme mber not being very happy about that, but ther
e wasn™t any question, it wasn™t do we have 
to, it was just  -- it was done. Because she saw no 
way to keep washing hair in this difficult, 
confined situation. The other thing that happened 
during this time is when I learned to read, I 
found that Hans, our gentle, young ma n in the ho
use, probably the only thing the guy owned was 
a set of books that was in his part of the cellar, which had been curtained off, and it was on a 
shelf in his part of the cellar.
 It was a series of books about the American Indians, about the 
Apaches in particular. And it was a series writte
n by what I understand is
 an Austrian author, 
who apparently never set foot
 in the States, and I unders
tand has done amazingly accurate 
writings and portraits of wh
at went on among the  Apaches. And I devoured those books, 
probably -- 

Q: This is Ka rl May, I think, yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
61 
 
A: Yes -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Exactly, Karl May, and -- and the -- the im
age in my mi nd was always of this proud, 
courageous American Indian, of course, the Ap
ache. And I just read those books over and over 
and over again. There wasn™t anything else, ther
e was no paper, there were no ma gazines. There 
was not a collection of children™s books in the h
ouse. There was not -- there were very few books  
of any kind around the house. So this series, this
 whole series was just
, you know, very precious 
to me, and -- and I spent a lot of time reading that. 

Q: So you learned to read
 very quickly, though, right? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Cause you -- you s -- in ™42, you were six. 

A: Right.  

Q: So by the time the war ends you™re only nine anyway. 
A: Right. 
Q: So when you™re seven or eigh
t, you™re reading Karl May? 
A: Yeah. Probably seven. 

Q: Probably seven. 

A: Right. And they were bi
g, thick, wonderful books. Yeah. 
Q: Did -- did you have to stay downstairs in thecellar all day and all night, or could you come  

upstairs in the evening, what -- 

A: In the beginning, I-I think I me ntioned we coul
d go outside a little bit and that -- but that 
stopped within weeks. And then we had to stay 
downstairs certainly all day. And in the evening 
when it was really good and dark, we would come  
upstairs and spend some  time upstairs, usually 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
62 
 
huddled around this clandestine radi
o, or a s -- in fact, I seem to reme mbe r  that we did not eat 
upstairs, so -- and -- and speaking of the eating 
as -- I think I was tel
ling you about the potato 
peel soup. You know, after that -- after that 
stopped, there was nothing. There was absolutely 
nothing, and everything was shutte
red and everything was a ghost 
town, all the stores were 
completely shuttered down with wooden protec
tion shutters and so on. And -- and we heard 
stories about people doing all kinds of desp
erate things, you know, hunting down pets that 
belonged to some body [indecipherable] or some thing, 
in the streets, and --
 and going out to the 
country to try to find rabbits and so on. And a
nother element of my parent™s planning for this 
possible eventuality came in the sense that aside 
fr om the beds that I saw there, and the quilts 
that I saw there, when I came upstairs one day and 
saw also this set of dishes that I mentioned 
before, there were, next to the set of dishes we
re bags, large bags of 
staples. Just the way you 
find them in a natural food store, they were s
acks of raw beans and peas and -- and barley and 
rice and -- I don™t remember specifically which ones,
 but ther -- there were
 all these staples, 
which really saved all of our liv
es, because I was fr -- I-I was qu
ite stunned, actually, to read in 
one of the papers I had been looking at, that 
they figured that some  -- some thing between 1700 
and 2500 people died simply of star
vation in the city. And we were 
just very fortunate to have 
had this that we could then share with our fa
mily. Which -- which certainly saved us. But then 
that ran out, and that was still -- the wa r was st
ill on. Also my - -  my mother was a bit of a -- 
probably natural food type vitami n person and she 
had had -- also saved 
and put aside vitami ns 
and -- and especially calcium pills, which -- I -- I 
-- I -- I™ve had rather tr
oubles with teeth, which 
are thought to have had some  basis in the war depr
ivation. But that -- that 
was part of what was 
there, and then when that ran out, then also 
electricity was out, gas was out, so you had nothing 
to cook on, you had n-no lights. There was -- for 
awhile there was wood 
for the woodstove, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
63 
 
coal stove, i -- of course, coal was long gone -- in
 the living room, but then Hans would go out to 
the countryside and -- and dig peat, blocks of peat
 that he would really, lit
erally drag back to -- 
u-undercover at night. And then after that, a-a
nd there was no more food, he went out in the 
fields and dug up sugar beets and tulip bulbs, 
which we basically ground into some  kind of 
mush, and tried to cook, as long as we  had a
nything to cook on. And -- and that™s how we 
survived during -- during this time . It was ho
rrible stuff, but it was 
what kept us going. 
Q: There™s no kitchen in the baseme nt.  
A: There is no kitchen 
in the baseme nt, right. 
Q: So did your mother cook for 
you upstairs, did Tante Toos -- 
A: No, I believe Tante Toos did. 

Q: She cooked for everybody. 

A: At some  -- 

Q: And you ate downstairs, I think. 
A: I believe we ate downstairs most of the time.
 Certainly in the begi
nning and I think later on 
when the stor e was actually closed, and if we ate 
later we were upstairs, gen -- it was dark. Now, 
the store, I have to also indicate to you, the 
store™s display window wa
s maybe at, you know, this 
chair height.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And ran in sort of a semi -circle from let™s sa
y the length of this room wall, and extended back 
ma ybe three feet or so. And then starting at th
e height of the displa
y window were mirrors 
embedded into a wooden screening. In other word
s, it was wood to the house side, and it was m-

mi rror to the street side, so that all these bot
tles were mi rrored in -- and when you walked by you 
saw this profusion of bottles and so on. But this wa ll of mi rrors only came up to about fi ve feet, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
64 
 
so you could look over it and see people, and see in
to the living quarters in
 the back. So there 
was never any move me nt above that
 height, or in the back of the house during the daytime. And 
at night it wa s only by -- by being lower than those 
things in the back or having the lights off -- 
once the lights were off anyway because there wa s 
no electricity, it was a little bit easier for us to 
move around. But that™s also when we were ha
ving these terrible str
eet searches and house 
searches, where these Gestapo would be patrolling and -- at random, or based on some  word that 
they got from some body, would actually go an
d do a house search. You know, tear the place 

apart, and -- 

Q: Wa s your house ever searched, th
e house where you were staying?  
A: Several time s, actually, and when the worry about 
this became  so great that we were afraid to 
be in the cellar -- again, I don™t know whose 
idea it was, I don™t know how the grown-ups 
planned this and talked about it,
 but it was decided that we 
should hide unde
r this display 
window in this three foot wide stretch that 
was under -- that -- that was, you know, probably 
three feet off the ground and three feet wide, 
but ma ybe 10 or  18 feet long. I don™t know how 
long, 18 feet ma ybe. And there was a 
little door in the store side to 
this, and the little door could 
open up and then they usu -- usually they kept case
s of e mpty bottles there, or beer -- extra beer 
supplies, or whatever. So what they did is they
 took those bottles and crates out of there, we 
would go in there at night and they
 would put the empty crates back
 behind us and then close the 
door. So the three of us would be 
in there, and on the street side
 it was just a -- you saw brick up 
until the leve l of the display window, and there were two little gr ates where you could get some  

air in this part, and my recollection wa s always 
that we were either hunched over, or some how in 

some , you know, very uncomfortable position, cause 
there we re three of us in this tiny space. 
And that one of us was always sort of on the al
ert that no one else woul
d ma ke noise. I know my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
65 
 
guess is that my mother was always on the aler
t. Because the noises, the br eathi ng, the sneezing, 
what have you, the snoring, could be heard through these vents outside. And you never knew if 
somebody was actually patrolling the streets, or wa
s out on the street and be ing silent because 
they were wa iting to catch you, or waiting to have
 -- to be able to observe one mi sstep, based on 
some , you know, intuition they mi ght have had. 
So you never knew whom to trust, you never 

knew what was going on, you never had -- you always ha
d this sense of watchfulness, of -- and -
- and I™m sure that that was part of the anxi
ety, was probably watchfulness that I was feeling on 
the part of the adults. And -- and we spent a lot 
of time in there, and it was a good thing because 
some  of those searches did, in f
act, th -- the soldiers went into the basement. It was a logical 
thing, there was a door. I mean, 
you know, they would have been 
stupid not to open that door. 
Q: I don™t even know if you know the answer to th
is question, but how would they account for 
the fact that there is this
 bed there?  These two beds? 
A: I don™t know, because I don™t reme mber -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- if they did anything about
 those beds when we weren™t in
 them. Whether they had some  
explanation, like you know, so -- if --
 if Hans™s friends stayed over -- 

Q: Friends come  over, right. 

A: -- I -- I have no idea. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: No, I can™t answer that. 

Q: We re you more frightened by having to go into 
this little crawl space than you were -- I mean, 
did you become  more -- did you beco
me  more anxiety pr one because of that, or was it all just 
sort of nerve-wracking in some  way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
66 
 
A: Ah. M m-hm. I don™t reme mber. I -- I don™t really know how to reme mber it, because -- 
Q: But you reme mber going in there? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, and I reme mber having to 
duck down so that we wouldn™t be seen, and of 
course we had to go into the store proper,
 and walk from the back of -- of --  
Q: Oh. 

A: -- of the store, which you could see when -- 
because you could look over
 this mi rrored thing -
- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- and get to that  little entryway which was 
right below the mi rrors. So we basically had to 

kind of keep -- duck out of 
sight and get in there. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So I do reme mber that very distinctly. And I al
so reme mber that -- that several things then 
happen as the war got worse and worse. And I 
reme mber sitting in the dark and huddled around 
the -- the radio, and sitting by 
moonlight, and -- and I reme mb er listening to the BBC, and I 
reme mber, you know, occasionally hearing some thing from the queen, and then hearing 

some thing from Churchill. And I also began to 
recognize, even as a child, that some how I ma de 
the deduction that if you heard the words C
hurchill and Montgomery and Eisenhower and 
Roosevelt that things 
were going better, and the adults se
eme d some what less anxious. And if 
you heard Hitler and Himmler and Goebbels and -- I 
could always -- I knew that they were going 
to be tense and upset. And -- and we did h
ear, actually, a fair amount of bombing, although 
Amsterdam was not flattened the way Rotterdam wa
s. There were certainly constantly air raids 
and sirens  and planes flying overhead and some  
areas were bombed becau
se the -- I know some 
part of the hospital was bombed, and I know 
the hospital had -- and the reason I know that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
67 
 
because after the war I became very ill, and I had 
to go to that hospital. But -- but during this 
time, there is that well docume nted difference in
 the way the allied planes sounded from the way 
the axis planes sounded, that -- 
the Nazi planes. And I reme mber
 the first time going to some 
film that had that in it, that 
-- that sort of unnerved me  because
 there it was, there were those 
sounds that I reme mbered. 
Q: What was the difference, do you reme mber? 

A: The -- the German planes were all sort of 
loud and sputtering and the motor sounds, probably 
without any mufflers and things li
ke that. And also the nature of 
whatever the ma ke wa s. And the 
Messerschmitts I think were some of those fi ghter 
planes that were always very noisy. And allied 
planes had a sort of low, humming sound. Now th
is ma y have had to do both with the motor 
design and also with the altitude at which th
ey flew, I don™t know. But boy, did we know it. But 
the end result often was the same  in that you had 
to go into air -- air raid
 shelters, which we, of 
course, didn™t. But the sirens woul
d go off for that [indecipherable] 
Q: Where -- when you were sitti
ng and listening to the radio, you sa
id you were sitting at -- and 
there was moonlight? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: We re you sitting in the back 
of the house near the courtyard? 
A: Not in the courtyard, and proba
bly not within view of any of 
the windows. I reme mber sort of 
-- the one side of the room had th
is little stove, so it™s 
not likely we were si
tting there, and it was 
some where in the wall area, or near the wall area 
that separated the kitche
n from the living area 
some how -- it was not in full view of that courtyard, no. 

Q: Could you use the bathroom during the day?  Di
d you have to be careful of any sound so that 
nobody could think there were 
six people in the house? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
68 
 
A: Right. I don™t reme mber about the bathroom. 
I really don™t reme mber about the bathroom. I 
just don™t reme mber. 
Q: When you got older, did you 
ask your sister about getting he
r period when she was there? 
A: I never asked her. 

Q: You never asked her. 

A: I never asked her. I di dn™t think about it, 
actually, until many, many years after that. But then 
some how it™s not come  up in the several times th
at we™ve -- but yeah, there were those -- 
Q: Because I imagine it would be tho -- 

A: I thought about it. I thought about it -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- what it must have been like, yeah. 

Q: Cause it must have been very uncomfortable
, I would think. Unless be
cause you had so little 
food, she didn™t get her period very much. 
A: We ll, that mi ght have been true, I 
-- I just -- again, I dr
aw a total blank. 
Q: A total -- right. 
A: A total blank. Yeah, the -- and the hygiene involv
ed in all that must have been exceedingly 
difficult, exceeding -- I -- I do have some  vague
 recollection of my mother cooking big pots of 
water on the stove, as long as we had the gas go
ing, and washing clothes 
in the -- and bringing 
that hot water downstair
s and washing clothes. 
Q: Huh. And she would bring it downstairs? 

A: That™s what I reme mber, but I don™t know if I 
actually saw that, or if I just surmised that. 
Q: Cause it would seem to be difficult -- 

A: Very difficult. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
69 
 
Q: -- to do it. 
A: I mean, s he wouldn™t bring this whole big 
pot down, but she would br
ing some  s m all basin 
down -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- of it. And -- and I™m sure we had the same
 routine for bathing. I me an, we basically -- 
Q: And whe r e would you hang clothes? 

A: In the basement -- 

Q: In the baseme nt. 

A: If anything was hung it was it was in the baseme nt. 

Q: Right. 

A: And far away from those front windows -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- because you could look down there. 
Q: Did you get along with Hans? 
A: Yes, oh yes. 

Q: You did? Wa s he nice to you? 

A: Oh, he was very nice. He was -- y-you know, I wa
s this little kid, and he
 always knew how to 
humor a little kid, and -- so I was probably a bi
t pest-y between those tw
o and -- but -- but yeah, 
I did l -- I did like him. I  did like him. 

Q: It seems like he was very helpful sort of a young ma n. 

A: He very much was, yeah, and I -- I guess one of
 the big, enormous differ
ences of course in -- 
in these situations, you -- you sort 
of think of your -- you know, sort 
of average teenager in -- in 
America, in this land of -- of plenty and mo
re than plenty, and you think about kids who, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
70 
 
know, don™t really seem to behave in a very ma ture
 way. And how is that these kids did?  We ll, I 
think one big difference is the fact that this wa
s for real. This wasn™t any fun and game s. And I 
think that kids grow up very fast under dema nd of
 -- of survival. And I th
ink that -- I -- I think 
that you, on the one hand, have to have  some  ability to be resi lient, but at the same  time, you 

have to have some  judgme nt about what need
s to be done in these situations, and being 
irresponsible just doesn™t have 
a place here, although I have to say, I reme mber being -- having -- 
comi ng down with a cold or some thing like that, a
nd -- and my sister bringing me  a cup of tea, 
and I -- and a thermo meter, and te
lling me  to take my tempera t ur
e, and I thought, oh this is hot 
tea, it mi ght be fun to see what the temperature 
of the tea is. I stuck the thermo meter in the tea 
and it pr omptly expl oded, the mercury all ove
r the place, and I was, you know, not in anybody™s 
good graces, cause there were no stores where yo
u could get a new one, so that was it, the 
thermo me ter was gone. Had I thought it would expl
ode I™m sure I wouldn™t have done it, but I 
didn™t know. And I thought, I w
onder how hot the tea is. 
Q: And it was a little dangerous, although you woul
dn™t have known that, for the me rcury to be 
rolling around. Not that there™s 
that much, but it™s dangerous. 
A: Certainly didn™t know that. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I certainly didn™t know that. You know, so that 
was a -- those were all 
very big issues, which 
some how in the overall scheme  of thi ngs have eith
er been suppressed or lost in my mi nd because 
they didn™t register, or -- some
how. And it™s kind of interesti
ng to ask yourself, why did this 
experience register versus some  other experience. 
And it™s been very intere
sting in talking about 
this too, is what suddenly triggers
 another bunch of me mories, you know? 
Q: Right, right, right. It™s hard to know the answer to that question, isn™t it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
71 
 
A: Exactly. 
Q: Yeah. Why don™t we change the tape.

Q: Okay. Hedy, do you reme mber the letters coming 
from your father?  Do you reme mber s-see -
- j -- 
A: Seeing them? 

Q: Seeing them?  Does your mother read them
 to you, or read parts of them to you? 
A: I don™t reme mber exactly. I don™t know whether 
she did initially and th
en stopped, or whether 
she kind of summarized the letter
, or gave -- and I don™t know if sh
e read some  to my s i ster, and 
some to me. I don™t remember.  

Q: Do you get closer to your mo
ther during this period than 
you were bef -- before, since you 
seemed to be much closer to your father?  Does this intima te setting and being thrown together 

this way create a different relationship? 

A: I -- I™m sure it did. I- I don™
t remember being conscious of a 
shift in relationship, but -- but 
then again, you know, even under natural circumstances, as you get older and change your 
behavior and so forth, your relati
onship with your parent changes. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I™m sure that the proximity added a good deal 
to it. And I didn™t mean 
to paint some of the 
early years as necessari
ly negative, cause I have other r-
recollections of, 
you know, of be -- 
being -- pl aying out in a field with her or some th
ing, or -- in fact, I have some little pi ctures of 
me  as a toddler playing in the Vondelpar
k, you know, the big park in Amsterdam.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I -- I guess as a small child the negatives out
weighed the positives because perhaps I took for 
granted all the positives and only reme mbered thos
e things that she said no, I couldn™t touch the 
horse, and you know, don™t get close to the horse cau
se he mi ght kick you and so forth. And so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
73 
 
that was where my will was being thwarted in a sense, and so ma ybe that™s why I remember that. 
No, I reme mber -- and I reme mber -- I reme mber
 her death, unfortunately, very, very well, 
because I shared the bed with her, and she died in her sleep. 

Q: She died in her sl eep? So she wasn™t sick? 

A: She wasn™t sick, and I reme mber that what I wa s told, or what ma ybe others were told or 

others talked about, they kept 
saying that she dri -- died of 
a broken heart, given what was 
happening to my father and so on. But what I™m 
surmising now is that she probably died of a 
stroke. 

Q: So y -- you wake up, and she™s dead? That mu st have been awful for you. 

A: It was awful. It was awful.  

Q: Did you scream?  No. 

A: I don™t reme mber what 
I did. I -- I really don™t reme mber what I did. 
Q: Do you reme mber knowing that she -- that sh 
-- sh-she wa -- did you try to wake her, do you 
think?  

A: I don™t think so. I-I have 
no recollection of what I did 
immediately upon sensing -- upon 
waking and sensing that she was not in 
her natural state. I don™t reme mber . 
Q: But you knew that it was some thing extr
emely different. And she was ma ybe what, 50 
some thing years old, or less? 

A: I™m guessing that she was in her early 50™s, on
ly because  I was eight by then, and I think she 
had me  in her late 40™s -- 

Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
74 
 
A: -- but, like, you know, if she was -- well, mi
d-40™s, so -- I -- I 
-- I don™t know. I should 
actually figure that out because I -- I looked up he
r birthdate at some  point, she was in August. I 
don™t know how old she was. 
Q: Do you now know -- 

A: She was ol -- she was -- must have been bor
n in 1896 now that I thi
nk about it, because my 
uncle was born in 1900, and she was the oldest, a
nd then I think he was the mi ddle, and then 
there was another sister. And the 
other sister, in fact, I found all 
this material after -- after my 
aunt died. I found a trunk of ma te
rial in the garage, which was a
ll of the correspondence that they 
had had, and my uncle particularly had had over 
-- since he came  to Ame r ica, first of all, 
apparently trying to get his parents out of Vi
enna and appealing to the em -- embassy about 
getting his parents out of danger, and writing to 
them about the fact that he had come  in 1930 
whatever, and he was now able to take care ofhims elf and hi s -- hi wa
 -- had brought his wife 
over and had a good job and so forth, and that he
 would vouch for them a nd take care of them, 
that they would not be a burden on the welfare 
system and so forth. A
nd that letter that  came 
back was a letter from some state department 
person saying -- it was almos t  -- it was almost a 
little sharp, maybe wasn't  meant th
at way, but it was sort of like 
we™re glad that you -- that you 
are a-able to take care of yourse
lf, and -- and self-sufficient andso forth and so on, but that does 
not give you any special privileges. It does not 
push you ahead of the lin
e of getting people into 
the country. And then there were letters from ha
 -- my other aunt, who had apparently hoped to 
get to -- I think to South Amer
ica and ended up in -- in Cuba, I think in Havana for awhile, 
before she was able to get to America. And my au
nt -- and letters that my 
uncle and aunt sent to 
each other when she was still in Vienna and she 
st ayed behi nd because she was trying to get 

visas f -- to get her parents and he
r s -- older sister out 
to Australia, and all -- and also a me isje, a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
75 
 
young woman who worked for them and who had b
een like their governess 
and so on. And she 
succeeded in doing that, and some  of the stories 
she told about how she did this, how she stood 
in line day after day after day to
 try to convince the authorities 
that they should give her these 
visa for her parents. How she 
-- she told the stories about so
me  young guy who was really very 
sweet on her, but she didn™t care about him, and he
 turned out to be one of the soldiers guarding 
the line of people standing in line for these 
visas, and how she kind of ma neuvered her way 
towards the front of the line in terms of th
is guy, who was now a Nazi, and who ma de  no bones 
about it. But still was kind of interested in he
r, and I guess allowed her a couple of notches up the 
line. And she described to me  a couple of times, 
unfortunately I never got it down, as to what it 
was like when she went into this enor mous room where this Nazi commandant was, and where 

she had to plead for these visa and exit permits
 and so forth. And imme diately she was addressed 
as a Jewess, and -- and in German she  quoted to me
 what he said to her, you know, what -- what 
does this Jewish -- Jewess want, kind of thi
ng, and -- she was an amazing woma n, just a gutsy 
lady with -- with, you know, just a so
rt of indomitable spirit that I 
hope all of us can have a piece 
of, but -- 

Q: And so th -- 

A: -- and she was -- then -- then she got them out
. Her brother, who had been in me dical school -
- in fact, she had wanted to go to me dical school
, but her father, who had once been quite well-
to-do, apparently had lost a lot of mo ney and when she, who was older, started me dical school, 

and then her brother came along, he said I™m so
rry, I only have money for one person to go to 
me dical school, and he yanked her 
out and he put him in. But she 
loved this brother, she -- she 
would do anything for this brother. In fact, she 
used to tell me  how -- how she got him to play 
the -- the moonlights -- Beethoven™s ﬁMoonlight S
onataﬂ by promising him a little money when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
76 
 
he was a student and he had no money. And then 
she went -- she became
 a clothes designer and 
seamstress, and she had this apparently lovely 
atelier in Vienna, where 
she designed clothing for 
the opera, and for the stage and so on. And a
nyway, her f -- her brother ma rried a young Dutch 
woma n who turned out to have been the daughter
 of the leading communist in Holland. So he 
emigrated to Russia. And when they got to Russia, he was promptly jailed because he was a Jew, 
and she was jailed because she was foreigner. So 
they were shipped off to Siberia, because they 
were both doctors, me dical doctors and they need
ed them. So they were saved because of -- of 
being doctors, and they were paid 
in bags of potatoes, basically, fo
r their services. And he was in 
-- h-he was imprisoned and everythin
g, he was ter -- a terr ible life. Terrible li --  I mean, those are 
all the side pi eces of th
e main pieces that -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- that happened here. Wa s just incredible. 
And -- and I reme mber my
 aunt telling me the 
story of how she -- she had gotten her fa mily out 
and then she had an elderly uncle that she was 
taking care of, and he was really in terminal illne
ss at this point in time. I think in -- but he had 
been a single uncle who had gone to America, 
and had come  back and brought them things and 
so forth, and she -- very much loved in the fam
ily and she didn™t want to abandon him,  so she 
took care of him until he died. And this was either 
a year and a half or two years later, so was 

much harder for her to get out. And she took the last
 -- she used to tell th
e story of going home  to 
her apartment and boiling some  potatoes and her 
girlfriend said to her, you know, if I had a 
husband waiting for me  in the United States, I w
ouldn™t wait for the potato
es to boil. And she 
grabbed her purse, and she said she walked out th
e door, and she got on the -- what turned out to 
be the last train going to the 
border between Germany and Holland. And they had to get off the 
train, and she said, and the sold
iers were directly behind them
. And she said she w-w-walked 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
77 
 
very quickly to where the railroad fencing was,
 and she said and then the Dutch people were 
there, and they literally pulled her under the fence 
so the -- the soldiers couldn™t get her. And she 
said then they were ther e with -- with hot coff
ee and -- and stuff, and helped people. And then 
she got to Amsterda m and so forth, and saw my 
folks and saw me , I guess, when I was two and a 
half or some thing, and -- ma ybe a little older. A
nd then she we nt to America, and then my uncle, 
who was -- who was both a physicist and an electrical
 and mechanical engineer, had gone to -- to 
America, wasn™t allowed to take any money out
, was apparently, so the story goes, in Grand 
Central, and pulled a -- an old New York Time s out
 of the wastebasket cause he didn™t have any 
money, and saw that there were j
obs for physicists and optical engi
neers and so on in Rochester, 
New York. So then apparently wrote, and so fort
h and so on, was interviewed and got a job and -
- and that™s how he move o -- th
at™s how he came to Rochester. 
Q: And that™s your mother™s brother? 
A: That™s my mother™s brother. 
Q: Right. 
A: And he was -- I believe that he was the mi ddle child, so -- and he was born in 1900, so that 

ma kes -- I think my mother was four years older than he. So -- 

Q: So your mother was -- was in her -- close to 50 when she passed. 

A: Right. 

Q: So w-what did they -- they can™t 
do a burial, I mean what did they do? 
A: We ll, this is -- a-again, I -- 
a-a-actually it™s the second time 
-- I™ll have to tell you about the 
first time -- it™s the second time that the -- th
at the adults -- and I don™
t know whether anybody in 
the family knew him, but they took this person, th
is other Dutch person into their confidence and 
told him what happened, and it was a doctor. And 
I don™t know if it was the fa mily doctor, or if it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
78 
 
was a doctor who was referred to them, or wh
ether Tante Toos™s brothers knew somebody who 
would do this. In any case, this doctor came so
me time in the evening or in the mi ddle of the 
night and took my mother™s body ou
t of the house and saw to it that she wa s buried. And in fact, 
at some  point in time  when I was back in Holland, I went to see him, he 
was still in practice at 
the time , and I -- I wanted to express to him 
our thanks for not only doing that, but for not 
turning us in. And he -- he acknowledged my th
anks, but he seemed very uncomfortable and 
didn™t -- seemed sort of aloof, a
nd I don™t know if he didn™t want to
 remember this awful time, or 
whether he in fact suffered because of it. I -- I 
-- I don™t know what the reason was, but he was -- 
he -- he kept very much apart from -- you know, 
it was the very, sort of professional demeanor 
that he showed. That was the second time , as 
I said. The first time  we took some body i n our 
confidence was as the wa r wore on, and the Germans 
were beginning to realiz
e it -- that their lot 
was going to likely be up, and they made their la
st ditch efforts. They were running short of 
soldiers, so they took all the 
soldiers who were doing the dome
stic duties in these occupied 
countries and put them in the front, i-i-in the war front, and they replaced them by drafting the 

Dutch boys. And now, our Hans is, of course, draf
t bait. So it became a matter of hiding him as 

well. And so four of us couldn™t get into this
 little -- under the displa
y window thing. And so 
now -- I don™t know in my descri
ption if I ma de it clear, but we
 had, between the room where 
this alcove bed was, and the kitchen, was a little teeny hallway, and there was a hallway on one 

side and on the other side was the half-bath. A
nd over this hallway and half bath was a low 
ceiling. But it f -- that low ceiling 
formed a kind of alcove in the kitchen area. And the kitchen 
ceiling was very high and kind of 
extended over that alcove. So wh
at they did is they brought 
some body i n, a carpenter, who ma de a false wall for 
this whole upper alcove area. And he did it 
with -- with wooden battens, so that it looked 
like it was part of a -- an existing wall. And one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
79 
 
square with battens was left out, 
so that that provided the entran
ce, so we would get on a ladder 
at night and crawl in there, all of use includi
ng Hans, and we would leave this square off until 
some body gave us the high sign that we better pu
t it on. But here there were -- there was no air 
intake at all, th -- if
 we put that thing there, w-we were
 totally without any -- never mi nd air 
flow, but -- but would have -- woul
d have died of suffocation had we had to spend any long time 
there. And -- and so we spent all 
the rest of our nights in the -- in
 the -- in the last parts -- year s 
of the war, there. 

Q: And that included your 
mother for -- for a time. 
A: Initially, yeah. 

Q: Initially it did. 

A: Exactly. 

Q: Did you ever find the -- where they buried your mother? 

A: Yes, I went -- I went back to see the grave. 
Q: So there™s a real place? 
A: There is a real grave. 

Q: And she™s identified? 

A: Yes. Now, I don™t know if my a unt and uncle 
took care of that part. 
I don™t know if they had 
her reburied, I don™t know if she was originally 
buried right there but not ma rked. I don™t know. I 
know that they gave money for her care, for the car
e of the grave in perpetuity because they did 
tell me that at some point. 

Q: Right. Di -- this is a question 
I don™t think you can answer, caus
e I don™t even know if there is 
an answer to the question, but when you™re --
 when -- do you have any idea when your mother 
received ma il from your father when he was 
in Auschwitz?  I™m just wondering, and ma ybe you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
80 
 
can investigate it at some point, 
is there some connection between 
getting that letter, and her f -- 
realizing what Auschwitz was, which you w
ouldn™t have known, but ma ybe she did. And -- 
A: I can™t believe that she di
dn™t know what Auschwitz -- whic
h -- what  Auschwitz meant then. 
Q: Right, no, I™m s -- I™m assumi ng she did. 
A: She did, and I think what you™re sort of impl
ying is was this finally her real confrontation 
with the meaning and what this meant for her hu
sband, which is very possible, and -- and -- and 
then the reason it may be possible is because the 
-- the -- when she died and -- and the adults, the 
remaining adults in the family said she died 
of a broken heart. Y-You ma y be onto some thing, 
that that™s in fact -- di d create some kind of
 emoti onal stress, physical reaction, I-I don™t know. 
Q: But you could not, a-as a kid, have detected
 for a mo me nt. And it could have been -- 
A: I-I know that she was very, very di stressed with
 the last -- I don™t know if it was a letter or 

letters. But -- but it was very cl
ear to me that there was a progre
ssion of news that got worse each 
time. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And I don™t know if it was actually what was in
 the letter, or whether 
it was the postmarks on 
the letter, because I don™t think 
they let anything stay in the 
letter that was of any use. 
Q: Yeah, right. 

A: Or -- or any news. And the other thing that 
-- I -- I know that even papers, radio, whatever 
notwithstanding, I know that there 
wa s a lot information that we got by word of mouth that was 
being -- for example the fact that
 after we went into hiding an
d the round-ups continued, we -- I 
know that we got word of the fact that all my
 father™s family was wiped out. He had five 
brothers, each of whom had fa milies and children and wives, and we got word of the fa ct that  

they had all been deported, and everybody knew -- seem
ed to know wha t  that me ant. I didn™t, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
81 
 
I knew that they knew. They got word of the f
act that my grandmother, her husband had died 
before we went into hiding, and I reme mber my
 grandmother at our house, sitting Shiva in a 
black -- black dress and -- and 
on a wooden bench and -- and so forth. So I knew what that meant 
long before I knew any connection to Judaism or
 anything. But I knew that she was in mourning. 
And I spoke a little German for those early years, 
I must have been three years old at the time. 
But then she was in a nursing home when we went into hiding. And the word came back to us 
that -- th-that there had 
been a round-up of that 
nursing home, that the trucks had just pulled up 
in front, that they threw people out the doors 
and out the verandas like so ma ny chickens going 
to slaughter. I know we heard 
that, cause I heard that then. 
Q: You heard it then? 

A: And so I -- I n -- I-I don™t thi
nk that ther e was -- that  --  that™s why it™s so hard to listen to 
people saying that they didn™
t know what was going on in that time. I th -- I think you -- you 
couldn™t help but know what was going on. And -- a
nd some  of the p -- some  of the writers who 
have written about these experi
ences also -- partly you knew 
what was going on because there 
was -- there was the knowledge that happened in
 the east. You knew a
bout the -- you know, they 
-- they pr -- they were first perhaps not exte
rmination camps, but you knew that people were put 
to death. And th -- and this -- th
is came  up in this film about Dachau for example, what people 
said, th-the resident s said, well this was not --  this was not an extermination camp. Well the -- 

some  of the first efforts of extermination we
re done in Dachau. A
nd I -- I™d -- I know there 
wasn™t television and so fort
h, but th -- but people knew, 
people knew. And -- and America 
knew. Amer ica knew. And -- and again, in Davi
d Wy ma n™s book, that™s all documented line by 
line, what they knew. That just wasn™t expedient 
to get involved. Just wa
sn™t where they wanted 
to go at that time. But it™s -- 
it™s -- I don™t -- I-I -- I 
don™t know -- I don™t know what you do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
82 
 
about that, you know, I didn™t -- 
I -- I mean here and now -- an
d this -- when you see these 
parallels of which is so horrible when you see th
e European nations apologizing to the Bosnians 
about the fact that they didn™t act when they
 should have to stop that bloodshed. W- W-Why 
don™t we do that?  Why do we -- why don™t we take 
action about values that are right and wrong 
instead of well, you know, you have to play the po
litical game, and I -- I think I used to be a 
whole lot more optimistic than I am now, but I th
ink when the whole Bosnian crisis broke, I just 
-- I -- I felt as if the bottom had g-gone out from
 under my stomach, and I just kind of felt -- w-
w-we just aren™t going anywhere. I mean, how 
these families that could -- that  intermarried, 
these families that were neighbors and friends. Y
ou get the right manipulator  out there doing the 
right PR stuff, and everybody loses everything that
 they supposedly claim is -- is what they 
believe. It™s very hard. It™s very
 hard to accept that. And -- and I th
ink the -- I think when I first 
came here, of course, people asked me  all kinds of
 questions. I was still a little kid when I came, 
I mean whe n ha -- when the war ended, of course, 
there was such a sense of -- a-again, what did I 
as a child know?  It™s very difficult to know. I 
knew that we were being liberated. I knew that 
freedom was once again back in Holland, and I kn
ew what it meant for me. I knew that I could 
run in the street, I knew I could 
open the door, I knew I could talk 
in a regular voice. I knew that 
I could find friends to play with on the street, an
d I did. There was a child across the street who -
- whose father was also a baker, but an only ch
ild who was a year older than I, and we -- we 
neither of us knew about each other for -- for ne
arly three and a half years here. And -- and I 
went to school, and she and I walked to school, and I had that life that had been on hold, that I 
had been waiting for as a small child. And then a
bout December, I got very sick. I had bronchitis, 
I had pneumonia, I had whooping cough. I ha
d -- I™ve forgotten, some thing else. 
Q: All together? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
83 
 
A: All together at the same time. I was really ve
ry sick and they finally took me  and put me  in 
the hospital. And I was on a ward, a huge room that 
was just  filled with cribs, mostly infants and 
toddlers, I wa s the ol dest child by far on that floor, because most kids my age, I guess, wouldn™t 
have gotten whooping cough. And it™s kind of 
funny because I don™t know whether I mi ssed 

getting vaccinated or whether that™s not a hundr
ed percent foolproof. But I was so sick they 
weren't sure I was going to ma ke it. And I certain
ly wasn™t sure I was going to ma ke it, although 
I don™t know what that meant in my  child™s 
mi nd. But every night there would be children 
carried -- dead children carried 
out of these cribs and I would s
ee this around me  all day long and 
all night long. I mean, that was a huge ward just --
 just lined up crib afte
r crib after crib. And you 
would hear these babies convulsing 
and coughing, as I was also. And then not be able to breathe, 

and die. And I was in the hospital about three mo nt
hs, or at least I was sick for a very long time. 
And during this time there was some -- some effort
 ma de at -- at ca -- well, actually the effort 
ma de to contact us ha-happened be -- prior to 
the time I got sick. But during -- but backtracking a 
little bit to the -- to the fr eedom
 thing, I reme mb er the feeling of
 freedom. I reme mber being able 
to throw open the door and running down the street 
to this street we we
re trying to find, the 
Hooftweg, which means basicall
y, the headway. And running along 
with every citizen who could 

walk or crawl, to line those streets to welcome the allied troops. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And you know, the joy, it -- it™s 
-- on one of the pages of that
 newspaper e -- edition that I 
gave you, everybody who was anybody, as I say, who c
ould get there, was there on the street. 
And the -- and the soldiers, mostly actually 
Canadian and British, not too ma ny U.S., t hrew 
candy in the crowds and stockings for the girl
s and the cheering went on and on and on, and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496

don™t know if I knew what I was doing and exactly what
 it meant to me at that time, except this 
incredible sense of freedom, just
 -- just physically feeling it. 
Q: We ll sure, because physically, whatever you 
knew about the politics, or didn™t know, was 
irrelevant in a way, because you were st
uck. And now you weren™t stuck any more. 
A: True, true, but that I could re
ally feel that and participate 
in this --  it was incredible. 
Q: Mm. We ™re going to have
 to change the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: Hedy, when your mo ther di es, are you and Betsy afraid that Tante Toos will not keep you 
there, or do you have no fear? 

A: I don™t reme mber fear as an emotion at all dur
ing this time , other than
 this constant anxiety 
kind of thing that some thing is going to happe
n and I don™t know what that some thing is, which 
is why we have to be quiet and so forth, and th
at™s why we can™t be seen. I hadn™t -- I don™t -- 
don™t think, at least I do
n™t reme mbe r , personally thinking about
 what™s going to happen to us 
now. I didn™t -- I don™t know 
if I was just so young it didn™t occu
r to me that this mi ght be an 
issue. Whether my sister thought some thing else, I don™t know.  

Q: Right. 

A: And there was certainly some  change and sh
ift in the dynamic now, because now Tante Toos 
feels even more responsible for -- for us -- for bot
h of us, and for me  in particular, I think, and 
my sister felt that she needed to rise to th
e occasion, because she was 
the -- the -- the next, the 
closest relative. 

Q: Right. 

A: And therefore she felt she n
eeded to act in this ma ture, re
sponsible way and -- and set the 
limits for me and do all those kinds of things. 
And some ti mes they clashed, and I was aware of 
that. And I think this was very hard for both. I™m 
sure it was difficult for this adult who had done 
all this for us and -- and so on, and -- and then 
therefore probably had occasional mi xed feelings. 
And that was very hard for my sister, who must ha
ve had to wa lk a thin line between also being a 
child, but also being the one that 
felt dutifully responsible for me
, and -- and how to behave in a 
way that was not ungrateful, and yet tr
y to put her perspe
ctive out there. 
Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
86 
 
A: A-And I -- and this must have been extremel
y diffi cult. I-I certainly 
was aware of it, but I 
don™t reme mber specifics. 
Q: Do you reme mber any -- anything that w
ould be like a mourning period?  I mean, do you 
reme mber your sister being depressed because your mother is gone, or do you reme mber a 

change in the -- in the house because th
is happened? Or is it all a blur  now? 
A: I s -- it™s pretty much a blur
. I don™t reme mber  -- as I say, the 
-- when you™re asking me  about 
me mory, I don™t reme mber there being a mourni
ng period. I don™t remember there being a time 
that was different from another time except my 
mother wasn™t present. I-I don™t reme mber any 
ma rkers, or any things that I 
can hitch any kind of response to. 
Q: Right. 

A: Just don™t know. 

Q: Do things get physically -- the winter of 1944 is
 -- or is it ™45 that™s
 particularly bad in 
Holland, I can™t reme mb er now. Is it -- do th
ings get worse physically for you all? 
A: We ll, the things get worse in the sense that
 we now have, as they say, we™ve gone through all 
of the food, all of our supplies, 
there is nothing H-Hans can™t really go out in the country any 
more, because th -- he runs the danger -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- of getting picked up, so yeah, I think I 
was a total of -- I™ve forgotten how ma ny pounds, 
but I was one very skinny little kid at the e
nd of the war, and I suppose probably when you ask 
me  did the fish hook thing cause an infection, it™s
 probably quite a mi racle that it didn™t. But I 
sort of ma de  up for it by being so very sick at that time. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
87 
 
A: And -- and my sister, who was trying to run 
around and -- and take care of the bureaucracy 
stuff while I was in the hospital, and getting pass
ports, and papers signed, and so forth, broke out 
into the -- first of all, she had terrible, terr ible
 stomach problems right afte
r the war, and I™m sure 
that they had to do with -- well, I™m not sure, bu
t I think they had to do with all this suppressed 
anxiety and fear, and trying to wa
lk this delicate line between 
things. And she had -- I reme mber 
having terrible, she had terrible, 
terrible cramp attacks, and I re
me mber being dispatched to go 
down to the Hooftweg, to this [indecipherable] 
and -- and trying to find the open -- the only one 
pharmacy that was still open, and get her Valeri
an, I reme mbe r  Valerian drops. Valerian I guess 
is still occasionally used, but it™s some  kind of
 -- it has some  sort of sedative reaction on the 
muscles of the stomach and so on. And I reme mb er 
when I got so sick and sh -- and I was in the 
hospital -- in fact, I had my 10
th
 birthday in the hospita
l, I reme mber this. And I reme mber this 
new little friend I had made from across the street, I reme mbe r  her not being allowed into the 
ward, and there were some  glass 
doors at one side at sort of r
oughly the same  level where I was, 
except I was way into the center of the ward. A
nd she was -- this is February now, she™s looking 
at -- and her face pressed agai
nst the door, holding up a sign, 
happy birthday, and so forth, 
comi ng to see me . But my sister had these terrib
le, what probably were staph infections, just 
these running sores and one terrib
le one on her -- on the top of he
r foot and she couldn™t get a 
shoe on, and she had to keep going and she had 
the shoema ker cut out some  hunk of the shoe 
leather for her, so that she could continue to
 -- to go about her business and so on. Because by 
this time in that -- imme diatel y after the war, the 
fi rst thing that --that  we got right after the war, 
after we had this incredible jubilation on the 
Hooftweg, was that everybody hauled out their 
clandestine radios and their record players 
and their hidden Dutch flags, and the orange 

streamers for the House of Orange, and o -- sudden
ly this stuff ca me  out of nowhere, and we had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
88 
 
three day block parties, essentially, the whole 
city that I reme mber, everywhere there were 
loudspeakers running, music, and there was dancing 
in the street and there was just unbridled 
joy. And the only people who were not unbridled in 
their joy were those --
 especially the woma n 
who were known to have consorted with the Nazi
 soldiers. And they were rounded up and shorn 
in public and ended up having to wear scarves ove
r their heads to hide their shame, and so on. 
That was pretty awful. 

Q: Did you see that? 

A: Yeah, I did see it. I did see that. But there was 
this just -- this incr edible, you know, there™s -- 
there™s n -- there are no words to
 describe this sense of freedom
 and this jubilation that took 
place during this liberation time. And of course 
now we were seeing army uniforms and -- and -- 
and the allied soldiers who were
 headquartered wherever they we
re, and -- and the soldiers were 
-- were walking the streets and my
 girlfriend and I had a little 
tiny pad each, because there was 
still not stuff in the st ores, they were still ba
sically shuttered. And the 
two words of English -- 
actually, I knew three by the time  I came to this
 country, but the first tw
o words I learned were 
signature please. And it -- we inve
nted this activity, we would go to a soldier and hand him this 
pad an-and little stubby pencil and ask for his si
gnature. And I still have those too, some place. 
Q: You do? 

A: Little pad of signatures, even some X™s wher
e they didn™t -- couldn™
t obviously write. And 
again, mostly British and Canadians. And I reme
mber that the other one was candy and please. 
So we would give them, we™d ask for their si gnature and then we would ask for candy, please. 

Because, of course, they had thrown the stuff from the -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
89 
 
A: -- trucks as they came through, on the tanks 
and so on. And -- and there was this great loving, 
and -- and -- and rejoicing and -- 
and great love for the American
s and British and everyone. And 
then w-we had -- we had these block parties, but 
we had them -- we -- I seem to re me mber that 
we had three big ones in -- in fa
irly rapid succession, like with -- 
within two or th
ree weeks there 
was another one, and then there was another one.
 And what I think was happening is that th -- 
that they were celebrating diffe
rent things happening as the wa
r was really, completely ending. 
And -- and then I -- I started sc
hool, there was a -- a neighbor
hood school, and I went -- walked 
with my girlfriend and she and I became  great buddi
es and spent lots of time  together. And after 
the war she asked if I mi ght -- would like to co
me on vacation with her and her parent s, they 
were going to a farm. And I was so excited, and 
I just loved going, and I was allowed to go, and 
it was a week. And I fell in love with the rooster™s 
feathers, those sort of 
blue green feathers. And 
the whole chicken yard was covere
d with these feathers, and I co
llected them. And I came back -
- this was my great, you know, souvenir from this 
trip, which I just ador
ed. I loved being on the 
far m with the animals and everything, and I had th
is great bag of feathers
 which I took with me , 
which I also brought to America, which then go
t eaten by the moths somewheres along the way 
and had to get tossed. 

Q: They allowed you to bring these in? 

A: Yes, yes. How, I don™t know, but they did. We ll, 
I™ll tell you how in a --
 in -- in a mi nute, but 
the -- that -- the happy days of this
 thing were then also ma de happi
er by the fact that we got air 
lifts from the Swedish Red Cross, we got air 
lifts of bread, and -- primarily bread, and then 
powdered milk were among the first 
things that came . And that was the first time  that I tasted 
this sort of soft, whitish bread. I don™t know why 
they -- ma ybe it was because it kept well, so 
that that™s why they -- cause it rea
lly wasn™t bread I was fa miliar with. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
90 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And then we™d began receiving parcels from
 both an -- my aunt, the other aunt, who was -- 
had meanwhile come to America, and my uncle a
nd aunt. And they sent packages with clothing 

and food and peanut butter. 

Q: How did they know where you were? 

A: That I™m not sure of, but I know that they co
ntacted -- initially they 
contacted the American, 
what™s now I guess called the American Jewish Jo
int Distribution Committ
ee. I think then it was 
called the American Joint Distribution Committee. 
And they conti -- tacted them because that 
organization was in -- was somehow infiltrated with
 the troops, in fact they traveled --  thei r 
workers traveled in American un
iforms . And they appa
rently did a lot of-- of rounding up of 
refugees in all the countries, a
nd were the -- the -- the agency th
at you got in touch with if you 
wanted to know if your relatives 
were still alive, and they -- 
they located us, and found us, and 
gave -- and to serve as the intermediary and so fo
rth. And then they helped to arrange for us to 
go to America. 

Q: Did you want to go? 

A: No, no, I didn™t want to go. I mean, if you can 
imagine how eager I had been before the war 
started, to go to school, to have a life and so fo
rth and so on, and now I come  through this period 
of intense confinement a nd containment and -- 
and life picks up again, and I can wave the flag 
and I can put the picture of Qu
een Wilhemina over my bed -- which I also brought to America 
and also had over my be d in Rochester, New Yo
rk. And I could do the things that I had looked 
forward to doing, you know, and I loved school, and I did very we -- I did very well in 

everything in school except handwerken. And handw
erken is embroidery and knitting and that 
kind of stuff, and I always either flunked it or
 was borderline. I could some how never get my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
91 
 
hands to do what they were supposed to do. And I reme mber -- I reme mb er my teacher, 
[indecipherable] and I reme mber having school trip
s to the Rembrandt house and to the museum 
and seeing the night watch for the first time, and 
all these things were ve
ry exciting to me . And 
now, all of a sudden we should stop again, and --
 and go somewhere where -- all I knew about 
were the Apaches, and that was sort of a savi
ng grace, but I didn™t -- I
-I didn™t know this aunt  
and uncle or if -- if they had seen 
me as a baby, I didn™t remember them. 
Q: Right. 

A: I was very happy with Tante Toos and living 
where I was, and I had this girlfriend and I 
played at her house and she had toys and I went on 
vacation with her family 
and I didn™t want to 
go at all. And I was finally sort of convinced 
of the fact that ma ybe it mi ght be worth going 
because I was told that in America people were so
 wealthy that if you had a hole in your socks, 
they just  threw out the socks, whereas I had to le
arn how to darn socks, cause we hadn™t had very 
ma ny socks and you just had to ma ke it last, so -- 
Q: And who told you this tale?  Do you know?  But wa --  
A: I don™t know. 

Q: -- what was it like for Tante 
Toos, I mean here she was -- 
A: Very hard. 

Q: -- taking you with her -- 

A: Very hard. 

Q: -- for what? F -- three years? 

A: Three and a half years,
 three and a half years. 
Q: Three and a half years, and two years -- no -- 
almost two years, she™s essentially your mother. 
A: Really for two years, cause I was s
till living there after the war, so -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
92 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: It was terrible, and I was aw
are that it was terrible. And 
she was very unhappy. I don™t think 
sh -- to my knowledge, she didn™t try to stop this, but
 I am pretty sure that she offered to foster 
us. 

Q: She did. 

A: To have us become  part of her fam
ily. And I don™t know with
 whom she™d had any 
deliberations about this, but I am pretty sure 
that that took place. And she was very unhappy 
about the whole thing. I -- I don™t
 know how my sister felt at 
that time, anyway. And -- and I 
think it fell to my sister to try 
to sort of ease that difficulty and 
-- and so on. And I don™t -- I think 
she knew my aunt and uncle, but certainly not 
we ll, because they only passed through the -- you 
know, they never spent any -- I th
ink he -- be -- spent a week th
ere, in Amsterda m on his way 
through, but -- 

Q: But she wouldn™t have known them. 
A: Oh, yes, she knew -- 
Q: Oh, your sister? 

A: Y -- my s i ster. 

Q: Your sister. 

A: Wa s my sister, not Ta nte Toos. 

Q: As oppo -- not to too 
-- not to too -- yes. 
A: And -- and it w -- I knew -- I was very well aware of
 the fact that sh -- that this was hard for 
her. I think at  this point in time, I thi
nk certain things began to register on me . 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And that was one of them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
93 
 
Q: And was it difficult for Hans, or you don™t know? 
A: I don™t know, partly because for him also, liber
ation meant liberation, and he later on became  
a photojournalist. I 
don™t know exactly what were the goi
ngs on between him and my sister. I 
know they were very close, and then there was a 
very close friend of his with whom the two of 
them were very close, so it was kind of a tre --
 a threesome. I -- I -- I think it was very hard on 

my sister for a variety of reas
ons, not the least of which was l
eaving what now had become  her -- 
her -- ma ybe more than just a very close relationship. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And -- and that was very hard, and -- and 
then the -- the JDC, the Joint Distri bution 
Committee also funneled food and cl
othing and so forth. And then th
ey sent a representative in 
uniform wh ose name  was Mrs. Roosevelt, if you can
 believe it. And I f-fell in love with her, I 
thought she was just a lovely, l
ovely person, you know. Rich, dark ha
ir and -- and this wonderful 
American uniform. I me an, this American un
iform was -- I-I -- I don™t know how to say how 
hard it was for me  during the anti-Vietnam times
, when I took a strong an
ti-Vietnam stand. And I 
was a girl scout leader at the 
time , and we were invited to ma
rch in the Memorial Day parade, 
and I had such a difficult time.And I actually sat the -- the kidsdown and explained to them that 

they had been invited, and this is what Memori
al Day was all about, and 
so forth and so on, and 
that I myself owed something to the American soldie
rs, but at -- at this par
ticul ar time, this al so 
meant some thing that I did not want to share, th
at I didn™t believe in, a
nd that I felt was wrong. 
And I wanted them to have two things out of th
at. One was, not a disrespect for Memo rial Day, 
in fact, understanding that
 I owed my life to these me n, and th
at I recognized that, and that I was 
very torn up about this dilemma. And I also wa
nted them to understand that if you believe that 
these values are important, then you have to do what this means for you, but you don™t impose it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
94 
 
on some one else. So I ma de it clear to the 10 to 13 
year old kids there that if it was important to 
show your respect, and you did not ha
ve a reason not to do that, that they should go ahead and do 
that. That just because I wasn™t marching, I 
wasn™t telling them that they shouldn™t. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And I think it was a lesson that went home to 
a number of them. But it was very upsetting to 
me. It was very upsetting to me, and I™ve ofte
n thought of Memorial Day times during these 
difficult times, and now here we ar
e back again in a situation that 
is just so horrible to me , so 
horrible to me , and I don™t know what to sa
y because every day you see not only all these 
Americans -- all these young Americans and old Am
ericans being killed, a
nd thousands of Iraqis 
being killed, and each of these, like me , has a fami ly, has a mother, a father, has children, some  

of them, brothers and sisters, and we just 
wipe them out, like so ma ny ants, you know?  And the 
farther away we can do our destru
ction, it seems, the easier it is
. We  don™t have to look these 
people in the eye, we can just 
drop a bomb. And -- and I just can™t
 over that. I ju
st cannot get 
over that.  

Q: So what was it like to see this M-Ms. Ro
sa - Roosevelt?  I don™t 
know if she™s in -- 
A: Yeah, I think she was probably Miss, I™m not su
re, but in any case, it was wonderful, I mean, 
it ma de an almost -- and she was that kind of 
person anyway, but it ma de an instant connection 
for us, and for me. 

Q: And the uniform mattered? 

A: And the uniform mattered. And a
pparently this is -- this un
iform travel for these refugee 
workers was done on purpose so that they would ha
ve more fr eedom of moveme nt and so on. So 
she gathered us up and made arrangeme nts 
for us  to go by train to Paris, and -- 
Q: Do you reme mber leaving Tante Toos? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
95 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Was that awful? Th
at particular mome nt? 
A: I don™t reme mber it being awful, but I do reme mber the hugging and the kissing the tears and 

the goodbyes. 

Q: There was crying, yes.  

A: And then I reme mber us going to Paris on the 
train, and I was very excited to be on a train, 
and -- and she -- ar -- I don™t know where this al
l came from, and how wonderful it was that it 
happened, but we were in Paris for a fe
w days and she took us around Paris -- 
Q: Really? 

A: And she took us to the amuse ment park outside 
of Paris, or wherever it was, and -- and it was 
wonderful. And I™m sur e  especially
 wonderful to my sister, who 
had studied French and studied 
about France and on -- so forth. And then she took 
us on the train from Pa ris to Marseille, and in 
Marseille we were put under the aegis of a 
French orphan group, whose name  I can™t quite 
reme mber, but was initials, OCS or something lik
e that, I don™t reme mber what it was. And they 
put all the children -- I mean, we were the only 
two, as far as I know, who didn™t belong to that 
French group, but there were hundreds of -- hundreds 
of children of all ages, and they put them 
all in the hold of this ship on 
these layers of canvas and gave ev
ery child a dirty blanket and said 
that you™re a number so and so on the thing. And 
I didn™t speak French, but every other child did, 
and my sister did and so on. And all I reme mber
 is seeing this big opening on -- big s -- huge 
square opening and seeing the sky from the hold of
 this ship, which had been originally a Greek 
troop sh -- a Greek freighter, which had been ta 
-- taken over and converted
 into a troop ship, and 
was now converted into a passenger liner. So the pa
ssengers, the other passengers were really all 
adults, and the kids were all in the hold. A-
And I don™t know if there was any other cargo. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
96 
 
we go across the waters of the Atla
ntic and sail, and the -- part -- pa
rtway into this trip I get si ck 
again, and I get this pneumonia and the br
onchitis and the stuff all over again. 
Q: So it comes back? 
A: Some  sort of resmi -- respirator y st uff come
s back, bronchitis, which I had fairly often after 
that. And my sister, in the best of efforts, t
ook me  to the ship™s dispensary, which had a Greek 
doctor, who was kind of -- I -- I don
™t know where his training was fr
om, but what they did to me  
there was cupping. And I don™t know 
if you™ve ever heard of or 
read about cupping, but cupping 
is taking some thing the equivalent of ma ybe a s
hot glass -- no, a little bigger, whatever, cocktail 
glass or something, and you create a vacuum in 
the glass by lighting a ma
tch into it, and you use 
up the air and the oxygen, and before you have a chan
ce to fill that back in again, you press it 
down on the back. And they put rows  and rows of these glasses on my ba ck. And then, of course, 

because there™s a -- a vacuum in the gl ass, the 
glass pulls the skin and everything with the skin 
into the glass. And then you yank 
these glasses off. So this provi
des -- what I decided the -- the 
reason for this was, to make you focus on some  
other pain, of such in
tensity that you forgot 
about what you really came  for. But it probably
 came from the me dieval notion that if you get 
the blood moving, that you could get the ill humor
s out, or some thing. And I was in huge pain, 
terrible pain, and I sat on a -- some  -- some  chai
r or other, some  corner of the deck, swathed in 

blankets and the tears st reaming down my face, fo
r days. And the sa -- the -- the sailors kind of 
took pity on me , and they would bring me  an occas
ional piece of fruit or
 so -- the food on this 
boat was all spoiled. The only thing that was edib
le was some  of the fr
uit. I -- I didn™t eat 
anything except the fruit that th
ey brought. And meanwhile I wasn™t getting any better, so I had 
to report back to the dispensary and they would 
do it again and again. And I cried so bitterly and 
pleaded with them to stop doing it, that they fina
lly stopped doing it, but th
en they did some thing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
97 
 
some what similar which is -- which is, if you can 
imagine plaster that is like an emery board on 
the other side, is like sandpaper. And they 
put this plaster on you with the sandpaper side 
towards the skin, and then they rip it off in 
rapid succession. So you have again, a similar thing 
going on, but it™s just horrendously painful. At leas
t it wasn™t as bad as
 the cupping. So partway 
across the ocean, one of the engine s dies, and then 
I became sort of aware of
 the fact there were 
all these adults on the boat, because then there was 
a lot of chaos, and a lot of crying, and a lot of 
people who were certain we were never going to 
ma ke it, and I saw how upset these people were. 
And I don™t think it registered on me  what it mean
t that one of the motors died and you couldn™t 
do anything. We ll, we did ma ke it over that o
cean and we did get to New York, and when we 
arrived in Ne w York there was a dock strike. So
 now we™re on this boat,
 twirling around in the 
harbor day after day after day with
 this dock strike going on, and -- 
Q: Are you any better? 
A: N -- I mu st have been because I didn™t -- don™
t reme mber any more of these treatme nts, and I 
reme mber comi ng into the harbor and I reme mb
e r  seeing the -- that bi
g neon sign, that horse 
with -- the winged red horse
, I don™t know if it was Te
xaco or Mobil or s -- 
Q: Texaco, I think. 

A: Texaco? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I reme mber a huge, lit-up sign for Lorna 
Doone cookies, and all th
e city all lit up and 
these skyscrapers looming up the air and so on. Anyway, finally, apparently the health 

departme nt stepped in and decide
d that this was a very bad situ
ation, have all these children in 
the hold of the ship. So they took just the ch
ildren off on -- on one of these sightseeing water 
boats, or several decker boat thi
ngs. And ki -- when we came into
 Ellis Island and unloaded, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
98 
 
my aunt and uncle had both come  to New York, 
but my uncle had had to go back, because of the 
dock strike, he couldn™t take off from work so 
long. So we came into this enormous processing 
hall of some  sort or other, and walked in ther
e, and I reme mb er my sister had her arm around me , 
and she was carrying whatever litt
le baggage we had. And as we cam
e in at either side of the -- 
this enor mo us doorway, were wome n standing with 
a stack of presents, and each child was given 
this beautifully wrapped box. Now, 
what™s in this box?  A set of 
three handkerchiefs, and some  
white handkerchiefs for the -- for the boys. We ll, 
not everybody -- ther--there wasn™t the sort of 
universal prevalence of Kleenex, I mean yes they
 were on the ma rket, but not the way they are 
now, and wome n -- proper wome n carried handkerc
hiefs. And although these were not elegantly 
embroidered, they were -- they were beautifully 
stamped with pretty flowers and so forth and so 
on. And I thought how wonderful that I™m coming to
 this new country, and they don™t even know 
me , and they™re here to say welcome with a gift
?  This ma de an indelible impression on me , that 
they would think enough to -- to
 -- to welcome me to the coun
try. I don™t know who the agency 
was, I don™t know who inspired that idea because 
it was both useful as well as a kind of a luxury. 
Q: Right. 
A: And it was just a lovely, lovely thing, you know?  
And it™s rema ined with me  in my mi nd ever 
since. 

Q: Obviously. 

A: Ever since. 

Q: We  have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Seven  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Who got the china? 
A: Tante Toos. 

Q: Did you leave that with her? 

A: Yes, yes.  

Q: And did you and Betsy discuss this
, or did -- do you -- do you reme mber? 
A: I-I ce rtainly didn™t have anything to do in the di
scussi on that I reme mber. And I™m sure that it 
was -- I -- I -- I™m not sure how much my sister ca
red about the china, but 
I -- I think it was mi  -- 
y-you know, it would have been improper some how,to take some thing like that, which clearly 

would have been a lovely thing for Ta nte Toos, 
who couldn™t have afforded to have had it -- to 
go out and buy it or whatever. And I -- and how do you ever thank some one for having done 

what she did?  I-I -- I know my sister has entered her papers
 and story and background and 
everything in the Yad Vashem Righteous Gentil
e history and archives and so on. But you know, 
first of all, this is comi ng along after the fact, 
and -- and sh-she is now 
gone, although I was able 
to go back to Holland and meet with he
r and introduce her to my husband and -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- two small children. 
And I -- I -- oh, I had such
 trepidations about this meeting, but it went 
just flawlessly, even though she 
doesn™t speak a -- didn™t speak a 
word of English. But she™s now 
gone also, and whatever honors and so forth, and so 
on -- which is not what she did this for in the 
first place, but -- but how do you rev -- repay some
one for that kind of gift, for that kind of 
sacrifice?  It™s impossible. I c -- I couldn't even 
begin to brainstorm ideas about anything. And the 
older I get, the more I understand it, and the mo
re I admi re here. She was not a complicated 
woma n, she was not well educated. She, as I sa
y, worked for my father in the bakery as a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
100 
 
salesgirl, and they must have some how kept in touch because  even when she was -- m- my sister 
did indicate that there was -- that
 they had kept in touch and so
 forth. I don™t know if there was 
any socializing back and forth. 
But that™s -- y-you know
, I -- I -- why did she do this, did she do 
it because there was money to be had?  I™m sure 
that wasn™t an issue. Did she do it -- there may 
have well passed money, but I™m sure this was no
t the reason. Did she do 
it for religious reasons? 
I don™t think so. I don™t reme mber them being very
 religious -- I mean, I reme mber -- I reme mber 
the neighbors after the war, I reme mber that 
the neighbors who ran the embroidery store next 
door were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who 
then seemed elderly to me , they probably 
weren™t, and -- and they were ve
ry religious, and they asked if 
I would like to go to Catholic 
ma ss with them the following whatever, whatever, and -- and I was a child who really kept away 

from religion. Now why?  It™s not so easy to sa
y. People ma ke an easy assumption that it™s 
because of my -- my experiences. I™m not sure. 
Somehow these experiences are in a separate 
category. Whereas I was never a child who had great
 notions of -- of God and -- and so forth, I 
had -- religion ma de me  uncomfortab
le, and I just wasn™t very k
een on it. But -- but I don™t think 
that that was the motivating factor w-w-wh-why 
would she respond so diffe
rently than the other 
siblings with whom she was raised? So I think so
me  of that had to do, perhaps, with the personal 
relationship that she had with my
 father. He had been very go
od to her, I understand, and ma ybe 
-- m- ma ybe that™s sort of what I always preach ab
out, which is that when -- when people get to 
know each other, when pe ople rub elbows together
, when you see that -- that, you know, this 

person is not some  stereotypic, stigma tized 
non -- untouchable kind of 
person -- I-I don™t know, 
m- ma ybe she had a crush on my father when 
she was young. I -- I -- I have no idea why she did 
it. Did she do it as wi -- what you 
said earlier, that she perhaps wasn
™t wild about Jews, but this is 
a Jew she knew personally and she felt that she --
 that he didn™t deserve, and his family didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
101 
 
deserve this. I -- I don™t know, and 
I™ll never know. She never, to my knowledge, talked about, 
either  then or  later.  
Q: And you never -- you didn™t say, why did 
you do this?  Maybe she doesn™t even know. 
A: That wa -- mi ght well be the case. And I -- 
I -- whether it was a spontaneous action on her 
part, I think it mi ght well have been, but she st
ayed with it, and she, you know, could easily have 
sort of changed her mi nd along the way, a
nywhere along the way, and -- and didn™t. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then when her own son was in danger as 
well, I mean, it was th-the -- the dangers just  
intensified. 

Q: Right. 

A: It -- it was -- it was tough, and -- 

Q: What the -- when liberation came, and peopl
e realized that you a
nd Betsy -- I don™t know 
what they thought about your mother, whether they
 even had any idea that your mother had been 
there -- were there and you were
n™t related to Tante Toos, did 
they say, who are these people, 
where -- where™d they come from, 
were there questions? Do you know? 
A: That would seem logical, but 
-- but I-I- think on the whole -- I™
m sort of generalizing, but it 
certainly was true at  that time; at that time, cer
tainly, Europeans tended to
 be much more private 
and keep mu ch more to themselves. So even if th
ey felt this, I don™t think 
they -- that they would 
go to her and say this. And there was little, if a
ny, social interaction between the neighbors and 
this family. And I think that that
 was fairly typical, I don™t think 
that people -- the other thing is 
that social life and friendships, 
at least at that time, and to so
me degree still, were among people 
who were much closer. There wasn™t -- there isn™
t this level of sort 
of almost superficial 
friendship and socializing that you have
 in -- in America. In fact, one  of the things I always try to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
102 
 
-- to talk to foreign students about when they co
me to America to study is
 the fact that people 
will say, how are you, but they don™t really want 
to know how you are. That™s -- it™s a greeting, 
it™s not an -- an inquir
y. And -- and some  of our students di
d wonderful little take-offs on this, 
you know. How -- how am I?  We ll, my knee hurts, 
and I wasn™t able to get the laundry done 
yesterday, and so forth and so on, Meanwhile the ot
her student™s out the door
. At this -- in -- in 
the same way, they sometimes end up very disappointed because they say --  the st udents will 
say, well, call me  up some  ti me , or we™ll get 
together, but nobody ever follows it up with a 
distinct invitation. And those ar
e the same  kinds of cultural di
fferences even more so, that 
operated there. People kept to thems e lves, they had 
their little yards, they 
had the fences. If they 
observed things, they didn™t social
ize about those things. So if 
some  of that took place, I don™t 
know about it.  

Q: So w -- you weren't identified as Jewish af
ter the war, and that was not an issue -- 
A: Oh, I™m sure I was. 
Q: You were, uh-huh. 
A: I™m sure I was. 

Q: Yes. 

A: But I didn™t have
 to wear a star. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I was back to my n -- regular name . 

Q: Right. 

A: I mean, I was called Hedy in Dutch. I-I was 
called Hady by my fa mily, Hady, or Hedy being 
the short form of Hedwig, but I di
dn™t have to be Hedy Ver meulen -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
103 
 
A: -- which was the equivalent of Jane Doe, 
or John Smith. I could -- 
I could be Hedy Cohen. 
Q: What happened to your 
original house, do you know? 
A: We ll, that™s a good question. Init
ially, it apparently was used by 
the Nazis as a some kind of -- 
I don™t know if it was an office or headquarters or
 some thing, or -- or officer™s quarters. I -- 
actually when I was back in Holland at one time , 
tried to find out what happened to this house. 
It™s not clear to me  that we actually owned it, it
™s possible that we rented
 it and I don™t know that. 
But I tried to get hold of the -- of the documents
 that would indicate what the story was, and 
there is basically a large, blank space. 
Q: Right. 

A: And at some  point or other, the city of Am
sterdam took it over, and for a brief period of time 
they had orphans living there after 
the war. And then I think it was 
sold to a private party, and -- 
which ma y well have been the one that I 
stopped to ask if I c
ould see the place. 
Q: Uh-huh. So you never got anything back fr
om your -- your old thi
ngs as a kid, right? 
A: Nothing from the house, nothing fr om a
ll the stuff that we closed the door on. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Paintings, and rugs, and -- and beautiful furn
iture and so forth. Nothing, nothing. Holland as a 
-- a country did finally ma ke so
me  blanket payment of a coupl
e thousand dollars to everyone 
who was caught up in this war, w
ith the understanding that you then 
didn™t try to sue them, or get 
anything back. But there was no quid pro quo for specifics. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Wh- Whe ther you had a house or not have a house. But it wa s very difficult to find out 

anything. And again, it was because of the exposé of 
some journalist that it came to light that the 
number of Dutch banks apparently had in their v-
vaults and safe deposit box, all kinds of jewelry 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
104 
 
and antiques and silver, and so forth and so on, 
that had been deposited there by Jews, which 
they claime d they didn™t have. And apparently 
the -- these banks had hidden this stuff in the 
attics of some houses on the canals and so forth, 
in Amsterdam. And some bright-eyed journalist 
exposed this whole me ss , which is how this 
payment came about, how this sort of blanket 
payment wa s ma de. But you know -- I mean, f-for some
 people it™s too late
, it™s -- a payment was 
too late for my aunt. She died in ™97, and I wa
s in Vienna, and I learned when I was in Vienna 
that Austria, at some  brief mo me nt in time wa
s shamed into ma king some kind of compensation, 
and that they -- it was so shame fully small, a
pparently, that there was 
a big -- I don™t reme mber 
this, but a big hullabaloo about it. And they stopp
ed this small payment, and then they started 
again, made it a little bit bigger.
 But they kept the time period 
within which you could apply for 
that so narrow, and that the announcing of this
 worldwide so closed, 
that nobody knew about it. I 
mean, here my aunt reads and talks German, an
d so forth, reads the papers. Her brot her was -- 
came back from Russia to live in Vienna, they didn™t know about it. I talked to my -- my aunt™s 
sister-in-law, who is now in a home for the aged
 in Vienna, and I asked her if she knew anything 
about this and she said no. She doesn™t know anyt
hing about this. And when 
I went to f -- inquire 
about this and so forth, they in-- practically didn™t say anything, 
but imme diately said to me , it™s 
not for heirs, it™s only for that person. We ll -- or 
-- or persons. So they ma de it very clear that 
they weren't about to do anything. But the N
th
 degree of this is how do you repay anybody?  How 
do you put a figure on what happened? 
Q: You don™t.  

A: But there are ma ny, ma ny peopl e, and I feel my
self a very fortunate exception, but there are 
ma ny, many people living in povert
y, living with very little m
eans, elderly, who should have 
that, and nobody should be asking them to have to
 go Vienna to rattle the cage there, and say -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
105 
 
you know, this is just so terrible. Or -- or wh
at happened with the Swiss banks?  My family 
apparently put some  mo ney in Swiss banks, which we
 have not been able to get out. We have not 
been able to locate it, we have not been able to 
pr ovide them adequate pr oof of the fact that  this 
was done. What am I s upposed to do, get my pa re
nts back from the grave?
 It -- it™s just very 
hard. And -- and the Swiss in their, you know, gr
eat neutrality, have profited enormously from 
this neutrality, financially. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And every other way. 

Q: After you got the hankies on Ellis Island, did you ha
ve to stay in Ellis Island for a day or two, 
or would -- were you imme diatel
y able to see your aunt? 

A: N-No, we were immediately through the -- 
we  processe d through, and my aunt was waiting 
for us in -- be hind some  whatever, whatever . And she used to tell me  how she will ne ver, ever  --  

w-would never get out of her me mory, out of her 
visual mi nd™s eye, the -- this 18 year old with 
her hand around her little sister --
 her arm around her little sister, 
carrying this little satchel in 
these clothes that didn™t exactly 
fit and so forth and so on. And by 
then I had pigtails again, and -
- and i-i -- th-there is this sc
hool picture of me  which shows how
 I -- I looked at
 the time. And 
my farewell present from my dear friend across 
the street was this bi
g, big ribbon, and the proper 
pin to put those big ribbons in on top of your hea
d, because that was the fashion of the kids at 

that time, and I didn™t have those. And she gave 
me  one of hers, and it was a farewell present. 
And so I wore that for my first day of school 
in Rochester, but it was not appreciated by my 
peers, and so I quickly put it in a drawer. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
106 
 
Q: Di -- had -- had your aunt a
nd uncle sent you pictures of them so you c ould recognize them, 
or you didn™t know what even they looked like? A
nd she is the ma rried wife of your  mother™s 
brother. 
A: Correct. 

Q: Right. So it isn™t even the blood rela
tive that you see at that mo me nt. 
A: Right. 

Q: But she knew what you folks looked like? She had seen pictures? 

A: Oh yes, she had seen us as litt
le -- little -- and as -- as a lot younger 
Q: But you were now so much older. 

A: Right, right. 

Q: But she recognized you, or so -- 

A: Apparently. 

Q: So me ho w. 
A: Apparently. I think probably my s i ster didn™t 
change that much. I suspect I did, quite a lot. 
Q: Wa s that okay to see -- wh
at was that like, seeing her? 
A: It was sort of -- I™m not sure you can assign a
ny -- any -- sort of anythi ng to that, because I-I -
- I guess for me it was, well this was the person 
who was my aunt. I mean, it was sort of like 
putting it out there, and saying, well this is -- 
because I didn™t reme mber her comi ng through, I 
had no idea what she looked like. And I guess I sa
y I was -- wasn™t thrill 
-- actually, my sister 
may have sent them the passport 
pictures that we had taken. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And my passport ticsh -- pict
ure was taken in the hospital 
when I was recovering, and I™m 
sitting on one of these Victor
ian settees type things -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
107 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- that was out in the -- the lawn area or some th
ing, and there is this litt
le tiny face, with little, 
skinny pigtails, which is swathe
d in this enormous Navy surplus, U.S. Navy surplus sweater. 
And right here in the mi ddle is U.S. on the sweater
, and this is the pictur
eof me  on my  passport. 
And she ma y well have sent -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- copies of these picture to them. Never thought about it, but she ma y have done that. 

Q: Did they have kids?  So you became their children. 

A: Absolutely. So imagine suddenly having an 18
 and a 10 year old -- or
 almost 11 year old. 
They -- I™m sure they were
 full of trepidation -- 

Q: I bet they were. 

A: -- I™m sure they were. And I -- 
I -- well, you know, I just marvel 
at them when I think about it, 
and I think about the -- the differenc
e in needs for an 18 years old and a 10 year old or an 11 year 
old, and -- and I reme mb er comi ng into -- into 
New York and -- and going to -- to the hotel, 

where I had this incred
ible bath, which I hadn™t had since 
God knows when. And I reme mber in 
whatever hotel we were, at the Hotel York or 
Hotel New York, or whatever, and my aunt is 
scrubbing my hair back, or what
ever, whatever, and the -- on the other side of the window are 
some  working me n, who are e
ither working on another buil
ding or washing windows or 
whatever, starting to whistle at the scene in this
 -- and there was no comment from her that I can 
reme mber, but I rememb er thinking something a l
ittle strange. And -- and then I reme mber she 
had one or two good friends who lived in New York
 who had also immi grated earlier, before 

things all shut down. And the next day they came 
to meet us, one of them came, then the other 
couple came, and so I quickly got to know thes
e were their friends. And we went to have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
108 
 
breakfast at one of these automa ts, and I thought
 this was just wonderful, this thing where you 
could keep moving stuff around -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and find -- and choose what you wanted, and I was very excited about that, and I reme mber 

being struck by the amount of food that was 
thrown out. Wa tching what people left on their 
trays, and it got tossed. Right fr
om day one when I arrived, that
 ma de an indelible impression. 
And then I reme mber liking very much we -- inthe display counter where -- where you paid the 

bill or  whatever -- it was either  ther e or at some 
other restaurant. Once place had a v -- a soft  sort 
of stuffed toy that was a -- a kitt
y, and it was sort of almost real 
fur, maybe it was, and I fell in 
love with it, and one of my a
unts friends bought that for me . And 
then in the other place I liked 
very much, it was a little red shoulder bag for 
-- for a young child, and I lo
ved it, and the other 
one bought that for me . So immediat
ely I was -- I ha -- I had these two very meaningful gifts, 
which I still have someplace. And then I reme mber
 being just so overwhelmed and excited about 
the fact that there were these fruit st ands on the 
streets, and bananas, which I loved bananas and I 
had not had them since before the war. And orange
s. And oranges used to be very special, and -- 
from Spain, and here were just this -- just enormo
us supply, and I still to this day will walk into 
these incredible supermarkets we have he
re, where you have these enormous amounts of 
everything, as much as you want. 
It -- if you only have the money 
to buy it, you can have it from 
all over the world. I --  it still 
blows my mi nd when I see it, and 
I -- it goes back to these carts on 
the street  corner havi ng all these things that 
I had not had. And I wanted bananas, bananas and 
bananas, and my aunt said, you™re going 
to burst if you keep on eating like this. 

Q: So you went from New York to Rochester. 

A: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
109 
 
Q: We re they fairly comfortable financially? 
A: Well, I th -- they lived very carefully, they liv
ed very carefully and I -- and in retrospect when 
I think about it, I think they st --
 they started literally
 with nothing, and they had very few things 
that they were able to bring, and 
very little money and they lived fi
rst in a apartment. Then I later 
on saw pictures of them buying, you know, their furn
iture bit by bit and so forth and so on. And 
my aunt took in some  sewing, did work for so
me  other seams t er -- a --a person who had a 
clothing -- very fine clothing store in Rochester,
 and she would do hems  and shorten things for 
them, I me a n, it was sort of me nial stu
ff for some one who had done designer -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- apparel and so on. In fact, I -- I learned to
 do hems , and I  used to get 35 cents a hem if I 
helped her out, and -- to do that. And we immediat
ely were sort of integrated into the household, 
and we each were given chores a
nd responsibility in the house. A
nd my sister and I always did 
the dishes after dinner. And we took turns doing ba
throom cleaning and each of us had to learn 
to cook certain things and once 
a week I had to bake some thing for everyone. So there was a 
kind of sense of pulling together, and -- and stuff. 
But I reme mber imme diately that it was a very 
warm and supportive environment. There was a 
lot of laughter, there was the -- and I had 
pictures -- I-I reme mber I used to love to 
sit on my uncle™s knees, a
nd he would sing little 
rhymes of --  of being a rider on a horse kind of 
thing. And then I would -- 
I saw pictures of me  
with a spri nkler in the backyard, and I think that
 they were -- they didn
™t have much money, and 
everything was budgeted. But they were
 -- they could take care of 
themselves, and they could put 
food on the table, and -- good food, and -- there were
n™t luxuries. They di
dn™t have a car, they 
didn™t have a television, they didn™t
 have a radio, they didn™t -- or
 a big radio, or a record player. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
110 
 
In fact, I reme mber when each of
 these things came into our lives, what a big occasion that was, 
and how special that was. 
Q: Wow. Did your uncle remi nd you 
of your mother in some  way? 
A: Don™t think so.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: If it was, it was at  a level that  I wasn™t aware of. 

Q: Aware of. Did they ask you a
bout what happened in -- in -- 
in the situation you were in. I 
don™t mean just about your mother, but -- 

A: My guess is that more of that was done with 
my sister, if it was done 
at all. Maybe they felt 
they should let us -- I-I don™t 
know. I don™t -- I don™t reme mbe r  being -- I do reme mber very 
much responding in a very negative way when thei
r friends or other adul
ts, or anybody for that 
matter, tended to ask me. Because I always had the sense that they were looking at me like 

some thing ri -- strange, some  -- some body that they 
couldn't relate to when I would start to tell 
things, so I™d stop telling them thi
ngs. I just didn™t -- I -- I would 
sort of politely -- literally work 
my way out of the situation. And -- and it was year
s like that, that I didn™t talk about the war. 
Years, years. 

Q: Is that because people responded as if 
you were some  strange creature, or what -- 

A: That™s at least what I reme mb
er fe eling, and sort of -- I began 
to feel like I don™t want to be 
this odd creature that they™re goi
ng to be staring at for the next
 hour while we tal -- while they 
ask me more  questions. So I didn™t want to do th
is. And -- and that was one feeling, and the other 
feeling that  I™ m sure played into that, was that I wa
nted to get on with my l i fe, I wanted to be like 

everybody else, and don™t forget, this was not in
 the days of cultural dive rsity, multicultural 
education, or anything remotely re
sembling that. You were going to 
be an American as fast as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
111 
 
possible. You were going to lose your accents
, and your strange ways, and you were going to 
confor m to what was the way of the world in this
 country. And being at an age now getting ready 
to move into adolescent, that was sort of partly
 what I wanted to do, too. I wanted to be  accepted, 
I didn™t want to be looked at as
 odd, I -- I -- it was hard
 enough to be the little girl from Holland, 
I was one of ma ybe six Jewish kids in an en
tire elementary school of 600. And it was not a 
Jewish neighborhood, I did not want 
to explain why I didn™t have bl
onde hair and blue eyes and 
why I didn™t have wooden shoes. I didn™t -- I wanted
 to desperately learn to hit a ball, for -- so 
that when we went out for recess and played baseba
ll, I wasn™t al ways the last ki d left  there alone 
because nobody wanted me  on their team. So that to me  was a  great da y when I, you know, hit 
that ball, and after that, boy, th
ey vied for me  on the teams. 
Q: Right. 

A: But it was -- it was hard, I was different on so 
ma ny levels. So I just wanted, I guess, to -- to l-
lose my accent, and learn to speak English, and pa
rticipate in American lif
e. I -- I me an, now I 
was here, it wasn™t sort of like,
 well, do you want to go home again. I didn™t want -- I mean, ad -- 
not that I had any choice in the ma tter, and I kne
w that, but I was now wa n
ting to -- and I -- I -- I 
can only say I was ma de to feel -- I-I have no 
negative recollections of 
comi ng to my aunt and 
uncle™s home. 

Q: You don™t. 

A: I think it was much harder for my sister 
on the other hand, because here she had been an 

adult, she had acted as an adult, 
she had been responsible
 as an adult, she ha
d taken care of us -- 
a young child. And now suddenly she was again a -- 
an older child in the home , and my folks 
had a lot of -- they -- they tried very hard, th
ey -- they went to the high school guidance people, 
and they asked what should they do, after all my
 sister had this terrific education from the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
112 
 
gymnasium,  and should she apply to college a
nd so on. And basically they recommended that 
ma ybe she take her senior year, so that she™d 
have and -- a more even grounding from which to 
move into the college. And she 
did that, but it wa s hard, you know, 
the kids were not geared to 
taking in some body like her, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- she was so much more serious, and -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- I mean, sh -- what she went 
through, they couldn™t even fathom. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So yeah, her way was much more difficult, mu ch. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I mean, in spite of the fact that I didn™t sp
eak a word of English, and she did, because she had 
studied it. But it was heavily accented, and she wa
s clearly older and more ma ture, and clearly a 
very good student, which doesn™t always 
endear you to other high school peers. 
Q: No, mm- mm.  

A: It was tough. 

Q: And wha t  language did you speak with your aunt and uncle? 

A: German.  

Q: German?  

A: German. They didn™t speak Dutch. 

Q: They didn™t speak Dutch. 

A: No. 

Q: I didn™t think so, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
113 
 
A: So my sister and I spoke Dutch w
ith each other, German with them -- 
Q: German with them. 
A: -- and English in school -- 

Q: Wo w. 

A: -- and on the outside. 

Q: We  need to change th
e tape. I think we™ll do -- 
End of Tape Eight

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: What was your aunt
 and uncle™s name ?  
A: Alfred and Anne. 
Q: Alfred and Anne. Did they adopt you guys? 

A: Yes. 

Q: They did. Wa s that soon 
after you came, or later -- 
A: N-No, offi cially it actually came much later. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But I -- I think that this ma
y have been out of a certain re
spect of understanding that we 
needed to kind of grow and develop our relations
hip and -- and so forth, th
at I-I -- maybe they 
felt this was not a -- a good thing emo
tionally to do. I-I don™t know exactly why. 
Q: But they seem like 
very sensitive people. 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. They were, and -- and they al
so were very old world people in the sense 
that they had trouble sort of understanding high school
 life as it existed here
. And so I think that 
created a lot of problems  for my sister. And also 
what I pointed out earlie
r is that she was so 
much older, and had had so much
 freedoms, and now suddenly -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- you know, you have to be in by x hour and -- and whatever. And -- and there was some  

tension even later when she went through collegeat the University of Rochester and she would 

bring home, or some  boy would come calling for 
her, and he happened to be German. And they 
apparently gave her the business about that. I 
don™t re-reme mber too much about it except she 
was pretty unhappy about it. They basically so
rt of said to her, how can you -- how can you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
115 
 
consider going with this boy when, you know, you™ve 
lost your entire family. And -- I me an that 
-- that whole issue is a very tough one anyway. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: But I think at that  time, it just was -- it -- I 
think it was extremely diffi cult --  it was extremely 
di ffi cul t  for her. 

Q: And less so for you. 

A: And less so for me . And again, 
par-partly the age, and partly 
the type of person. I me an, if 
they were critical of her, and my -- my uncle wa
s -- tended to be super-
critical, he was a very 
dema nding father figure, a -- he was very 
bright, he couldn™t understand why you didn™t 
understand your ma th. And when I would bring a 
report card home  and it would have all 
excellents and one satisfactory, he would sa
y, what happened here?  Why didn™t you get -- you 
know, it wa-was never isn™t this a wonderful report car
d, but rather -- 

Q: What™s wrong. 
A: What™s the pe -- he would always see the pi
ece that was lacking. By the same  token they both 
were very strongly committed to the importance of education, and that was not some thing you 
took lightly. And long decades afterwards, I underst
ood from the story that he lived, that they 

lived, how important that was. They would have
 been in the poorhouse otherwise, if he hadn™t 
been able to -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: An-And they always impressed on us the importa
nce of education is some
thing -- part of it is 
the fact that it™s not some thing 
anyone can take away from you. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
116 
 
A: And I -- it was long after, when I was doing my
 doctoral dissertation and I finally got to the 
point where I was writing the -- the dedication, 
that I acknowledged that early teaching, because 
it hadn™t actually registered on me
, but I realized I had sort of 
come  slowly to a point where I 
understood that they were in part responsible for 
my continuing to -- to go there, go that route. 
Q: We re they religious? 

A: N -- I wouldn™t say they were -- I think my aunt
 was less religious than my uncle. I think that 
they believed in the importance of maintain
ing certain traditions. They believed in the 
importance of supporting the Jewish people as 
a people. They became founding me mbers of the 
synagogue in We stport, actually, and 
helped to -- to -- to
 set that up. They insisted that I go to 
Sunday school, and I guess when I was an absolute
, mi serable person -- child, when I was little, 
and -- and given to tantrums, I guess that™s the bi
ggest one I ever threw, was when they said I 
had to go to Sunday school. I ins
tinctively didn™t want Sunday sc
hool, I instinctively didn™t want 
part of that , I instinctively reject
ed any notion of religio
sity and religious stuff and all the rest of 
it, and I probably also rejected any other entr
apment for being different again. I don™t know how 
cognizant I was of that, but 
I think intuitively I was. 
Q: So you™re not a religious person at all, do 
you think?  I -- I don™t mean
 in a traditional way, 
even in some  me taphysical way, believing that
 there is a higher 
power of some  kind. 
A: I™m not an agnostic -- I mean, I™m not an at
heist, but I™m probably an
 agnostic, if -- if you 
have to pigeonhole me  at all. But I -- 

Q: I don™t wa nt to if I don™t have to. 

A: I mean in -- in one sense, I have fe lt that 
the things that have been done in the name of 
religion are so reprehensible th
roughout history, with 
no religion left outside
 of that blanket 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
117 
 
indictme nt, that I think it has not done good, it ha
s done bad. And I -- it™s only continuing that 
way. 
Q: And whe n you went to Sunday school, was it terrible for you? 

A: We ll, it wasn™t terrible, it wa
s sort of ineffectual as far as
 I was concerned, it was, you know, I 
couldn™t sleep late on Sunday and I had to go ther
e, and blah, blah, blah, and I hated it, and I 
went. And I got -- I made some friends, and 
most  of the Jewish kids didn™t live in our 
neighborhood, so any friendships I ma de were di
fficult to follow up on because they were in 

other parts of Rochester. And they themselves we
re me mbers of the Conservative Temple in -- in 
Rochester, but they felt okay with me  going to the Refor med s ynagogue, which was interesting. 

But when it came to the high holidays, they walk
ed, and they celebrated them, and they wanted 
me  to do likewise, and I was supposed to go to services with them, and walk to Temple, and not 

being a great lover of walking from the days 
I went through the alley 
at the -- at the wax 
museum, I always sort of resented that, and I 
thought that the whole idea was crazy and foolish 
and you know, it just seemed to me  s ort of -- a
nd then of course I was out of school on those 
days, and I didn™t like that, and I had to go back
 and explain why wasn™t I in school. And those 
were not the days when you were given to be ex
cused because it was religious absence and stuff, 
so that was always a pain. On the other hand, by 
the time  I got to about the eighth grade, I had a 
very good teacher, and we  had some  real history, 
and the history of the Jewish people. And I 
ended up actually valuing that be
cause I did learn some thing he
re, and because I always found 
myself in the position of being the only Jewish
 kid in a large gathering of non-Jews. And so I 
was always the spokesperson, a not particularly w
illingl -- willingly, but pe
ople put me  there. So 
I would have  to answer questions about what do 
Jews believe and -- and why did they kill Chri st, 
and all these kinds of things. And it ma de me
 rather unhappy, but I felt better having had the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
118 
 
class, so that I could in fact 
answer some  questions. And so actually I stayed on, and stayed in 
the Confirmation year, which was yet another year, 
and then I learn even more about what Jews 
believe and why they do what they do. And then 
I was Confirme d and I went on and stayed in -- 
I-I was -- I sang in the choir in 
the synagogue and then I st ayed on and did two more years of 
what was called post-Confirma tion class. And we
 did comparative religion, and we did study of 

the Torah and so forth, wi-with Rabbi Philip Bernstein who™d been a --  a chapel --  chaplain at  --  

during the second war. And I think 
that there wa s a lot that I bega
n to appreciate about what then 
became something more meaningful. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And as my life continued, it was 
always in this vein of being, 
for example, out of 1800 in the 
high school, there were proba
bly 10 or fewer Jewish kids at th
at particular high school. S -- and 
then I was -- I was very active in the girl scouts,
 and I was selected to represent New York state 
at a national encampment, and I was back in th
e same  pool of, you know, well tell us about Jews. 
Now they didn™t ask me  stuff about the war yet, 
and -- and -- or -- well, some  people did, but I 
sort of kept that still pretty much closed. Bu
t I did appreciate that, 
and I -- but I had such a 
commit me nt  to trying to improve the whole 
Sunday school experience 
for children that I 
volunteered to teach Sunday school. 
I -- I had this presumptuous se
nse that I could do it better 
than these other people. 

Q: We re you right? 

A: And I think I did. 

Q: Yes. You did? 

A: Yeah, well was a little bit -- li
ttle bit difficult. I mean, on the 
first year I was teaching, a -- one 
of the little kids of -- first or -- kindergarte
n, first grade or some thing, came up to me  and said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
119 
 
ﬁYou know, Mrs. Cohen, I saw God on television last
 night.ﬂ And the -- thi
ngs like that were a 
little difficult to cope with, but th
ere was definitely a sense on my 
part that I felt a -- a -- a -- a 
reason to be a teacher, to -- to teach kids somethi
ng, and to not disperse or
 dispel any notions of 
God, or the existence of God, which I would neve
r do, but to bring in wh
at is important about 
religions, and beliefs and values. Wh-What -- what 
is there that ™s really 
worth fighting for here? 
And I think that that really was 
the sort of connecting thread to 
most of what I did all my life. 
Going into education with a strong belief in -- in the value of education for teaching, and for 
opening up horizons and for having people learn to liv
e with each other and so forth. I was a -- a 
one world candidate, and in high school I was,
 you know, preaching -- or  not preaching, but I 
was s-supporting those kinds of
 organizations. I reme mber some  very narrow- mi nded high 
school teachers with whom I challenged their view
points and so forth. I was 
never afraid to stand 
up or to speak out, and as turns out, neither are 
my kids. But I didn™t need to be pigeonholed, and 
I didn™t want to be pigeonholed, and -- a-and it 
was -- it was -- it was a very much longer time  
before I began talking about the war, and as I sa
id earlier, I -- I never t
hought of myself as a 
survivor. I thought only those peop
le who had survived the camps,
 the people -- th-th-the -- the 
displaced persons, the people who had the numbe rs 
carved on their arms. I didn™t have that, and I 
was alive, and I was -- I was with a family, a
nd I guess I was hidden, but -- so -- and -- and I 
reme mber the fi rst time, the very fi rst time that I saw any movie that  related to anythi ng having 

to do with the war. I-It was -- it --  it packed
 an enormous e motional wallop, and it was, ﬁThe 
Pawnbroker.ﬂ And I don™t know 
if you reme mber the film. 
Q: I do, yeah. 

A: But this -- and this whole 
struggle of this poor ma n, who hims
elf had been a displaced person, 
and you get that message as you see his arm and 
so forth. And he suspects this young, black guy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
120 
 
of stealing from hi m. And then th
e struggle within himself about 
not wanting to stereotype and 
not wanting to ma ke assumptions because this ki
d™s black. And then his head running over with 
the re -- me mories of the camps, and -- and then
 having this interspersed with the actual 
newsreels of that period of the -- of the camps. 
I went home, I was wiped out. I had se -- Peter 
had told me  some  months before, I don™t think y
ou want to see that, but I went to see it anyway. 
And by then I had one or two kids and we were at
 Smith, and I had a babysitter and wanted to go 
to the movies on the campus. And I came back and this babysitter opened the door, and she 
didn™t see the fact that I was really still speech
less. And she sort of bubbled over and said, ﬁOh 
hi, Mrs. Rose, how™d you enjoy the movie?ﬂ And 
I was just stunned by he r use of the word 

enjoy, and I -- she di dn™t see my face, didn™t no
tice anythi ng, and I said, ﬁWell, I don™t think 
enjoy is the word you want to use with that
 film.ﬂ And she said, ﬁWell, y-you know, my 
roomma te a nd I kind of th-thought about going to see it, but then we figured it was so much 

Hollywood ma ke-believe.ﬂ And thisis in the early 60™s and that™s when I had one my  early, sort 
of comeuppances about the fact th
at I have to speak, I can™t rema
in silent if people are thinking 
that. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And another time  the same  thing happened wi
th when I was driving between Syracuse and 

Rochester, or wherever, or Ithaca, and I was 
listening to a -- it mus -- mus t  have been around 
Passover time, and I was looking for some  station on the dial and twisting the dial and I heard 

this rabbi speaking, and I -- some thing either ma de me  stop -- ma ybe I put my hand on the 

wheel, and the rabbi said some thing like, some day we™re going to have the story of the Holocaust 

between the covers of a little 
book, and we will ha ve a holiday to comme morate that it happened, 
and everyone re -- will read what it says in 
the book and they™ll say, th
is couldn™t possibly have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
121 
 
happened. And all of a sudden I ma de the connec
tion between the Hagadah and the story of the 
plagues and the exodus of -- from Egypt, and my
 own reaction at the table at home where I 
thought, oh this could never have happened. I™m thinking, oh my God. Y- You know, he™s 
absolutely right. And this was long before we ha
d the holiday and long before we set aside this 

time, and -- and so forth, and I t
hought -- and that -- these two inci
dents, I think, sort of propelled 
me  to get over my reluctance to speak, and when th
is girl -- this babysitte
r said to me -- she™s 
finally re-registered some thing of my  face -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and she said, would I be willing to come  
and speak to them in the dorm?  And I said of 
course, and that was sort 
of the beginning of it. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then I was asked in classes and assemblie
s and so on. So then ma ny years followed of 
that. But -- 
Q: And was this before you got your degree? 
A: Before I got my doctorate, yes -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yes. It started before then. 

Q: And you ma rried Peter when you were a sophomore in college? 

A: Right. 

Q: So you were a young person. 

A: A very young bride. 

Q: Young person. 

A: A very young bride. Yeah, I me t him in between
 my junior and senior
 year in high school. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
122 
 
Q: And was he in high school also, 
or was he a little bit older? 
A: No, he was between junior and 
senior year in college, so -- 
Q: Ah, wow. 
A: -- he was all bi -- already about fe
d up with college and all its stuff -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and then -- then here was th
is -- his girlfriend, a
nd here I -- I was very active in school, and 
I had a lot of responsibilitiesand commit me nts and had a wonderf
ul -- wonderful principal and 
so on. Then I -- I gave up some  of those things
 once we started going toge
ther, but it was hard 
for him to get into this scene -- 

Q: Yes, I would imagine, right. 

A: -- the high school scene,
 after the college scene. 
Q: Did he find out very quickly ab
out your war years, or did it take
 you a few years to be able to 
tell him as well? 
A: I think it was more gradual with him. I 
think things came out pieceme al over time and 
discussion and as we grew to know each other more
, and so forth. And it was a -- after all, it was 
three years before we were ma rried, but yeah, 
it -- it -- well, it did 
not all come  at once. 
Q: Right. 
A: And -- and it was not -- and it was not a public 
thing, either, it was very
 much more private. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So it doesn™t become pub
lic for you until the 60™s, until these -- 
A: Exactly.  

Q: [indecipherable] first time. 

A: It does not become  public. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
123 
 
A: Right. And -- 
Q: Do you now consider yourself a survivor? 

A: I do now, and I also realize that more and more
 of us are gone. And th
at er -- that the -- the 
littlest bit that I can do to bear testimony to this
 event is probably the only thing I can do to 
justify that I am a mong the living, and so ma ny 
a r e among the dead. And if I™m not willing to do 
that, then I™m really doing a grave di sservice, 
both to humankind and to those who died, because 
no one was there to speak for them if it™s not 
comi ng from us. And the -- the dilemma about not 
only studying this whole huma n element to -- to 
realize -- well, I made 
me ntion for example of 
the -- of ﬁThe Eye of the Storm,ﬂ or the -- the, 
ﬁBlue Eyes, Brown Eyes,ﬂ and all of those. Yes, 
we can isolate those particular behaviors and 
we can call them by na me s and we can study them. 
Stanley Milgrim, a social psychologist at Yale 
did these studies that are probably more telling 
about what happened and why people and how people 
were able to do these 
terrible things. If 
you know the -- I™m -- I™m sure you do, but he -- he 
basically put some body in a white coat in a 
lab with a one way mi rror, and he brought people in
 off the street, and said we™re running this 
experime nt. We™re going to see how much pain
 these -- how much shock these subj ects are 

willing to endure. And below the one way mi rro
r was a group of actors 
in a studio. And there 
was a fake set of dials and people turned up 
the electricity. Up and up and up. And it didn™t 
ma tter that the actors were writhing on the floor
 and screami ng and calling and saying stop, stop. 
It apparently did not affect most of the people, not every single one. And now you couldn™t do 

that ki nd of experime nt any more because of
 the upset to the people who -- who came to 
recognize what they were capable of doing. But 
if we™re capable of doing that, and we keep 
doing it, and we keep doing it, and we  keep turning our backs to what™s going on in areas where 

other people are doing it, we
™re not advancing at all. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
124 
 
Q: So what good is it to talk about, do you think? 
A: We ll, I think that if ther
e are enough people who hear it, and if there are enough people who 
are struck by the fact that this 
kind of behavior can lead to this 
kind of event, the Holocaust, that 
ma ybe it behooves them to do some thing before we ge
t there. Maybe. I -- I think th -- I only -- I 
have to continue to believe that
, because otherwise I can™t conti
nue to go on. And this is also 
back to what I said earlier a
bout the fact you never know what you
™re able to sustain, you never 
know what you are able to do, or what you™d be 
willing to do in a situation where your life 
depends on it, or the lifes of your loved ones. Bu
t the bottom l i ne is that we  should perhaps not 
be so adaptable. We  should not be able to do 
what these Jews  did for so long, throughout history, 
which is to adjust to the behavior that  was 
impos ed on them, and the restrictions imposed on 
them, and the tortures imposed on them. What 
can you do?  You can™t stand up and fight. I know 
that they -- they were helpless, they had no w
eapons, they had no allies, they had nothing. So the 
question about why didn™t they stand up and fi
ght become s a -- a moot question, really. But 
when you find yourself in a situation where we 
really must stop, I don™t know why we , as a 
nation, aren™t in the streets, and I consider myself equally guilty, because I don™t know what to 

do. But why are not in the street 
dema nding that we stop killing?  
How far have we come  if we 
can™t sit around the table and 
try to work things out. Why 
ca n™t we -- I took training in 
me diation. Much of my  work has been in -- in 
law in education, and first amendment rights. And 
those liberties and freedoms that 
we have fought for in this co
untry, since time i mme morial as 
far as the history of this country, why are we
 suddenly ma king different rules for different 

people?  I -- I don™t know how to adju
st to that, it -- it -- it™s -- 
I think when people used to ask 
me , you know, do you wa -- well, how do you fe el about
 this country and so forth, and I always 
had felt this is the country where people can ta
lk, where people can argue, where you can have a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
125 
 
dialog, where we have an open press. And yet things keep comi ng out, and keep comi ng out and 
keep comi ng out. In the papers every day, in th
e -- the gene ral news. I don™t have access to any 
private news any more than anybody else. But finally 
it™s getting to people in the streets that this 
president lied to us, and for whatever personal re
asons went to war, kil
ling not only Americans, 
but also Iraqis, or Afghanis, a
nd the -- and the justification fo
r af -- Afghanist
an, I think, is 
certainly greater than Iraq. But there were no w
eapons of ma s s destruction. Why do we  support a 
world organization?  Wh y do we say other countries 
have to adhere to the 
decisions of the world 
organization, but we™re outside the law. This doe
sn™t ma ke any sense. That doesn™t mo ve us 
forward. It doesn™t put us in the situation of 
-- of ma king unacceptabl e certain ways of warfare 
and torture and behavior. We  -- we ti -- we say 
Amnesty International is wr ong. They come  in -- 

the Red Cross is bamboozled, just as they were
 by the Nazis. The Nazis came into the camps, 
into some  of those camps, and there is data that I 
have just seen this spring, actually, at Hoover, 
indicating what the me n were told, what the soldie
rs were told, in order to dress up the camp so 
that the Red Cross could come  in and be im
pressed. How they had casual music groups, how 
they had cafés set up, they shipped ha lf of the 
camp population off to another camp because they 
-- the -- otherwise the Red Cross would say 
you have too ma ny people per square bed, or 
whatever. Well, such as you mi ght call it. It™s un
believable what these people did. And here, first 
person accounts that I am now finding in the or
iginal languages about what the Nazis did in 
order to bamboozle the Red Cross. But we are 
in similar situations, uncomfortably similar 
situations. And I can™t live with this, I am findi
ng this nightmarish. My daughter and I talk on the 
phone and we™re either in tears, or we™re so ups
et every phone call that I 
finally said to her, 
we™ve got to put this off limits, we can™t do this. 
I c -- I can™t -- I can™t do this. But I am -- I am 
just as bad as everybody else. I haven™t done an
ything except signing petitions and trying to get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
126 
 
people to listen and read. But I 
haven™t gone off in the street 
and demonstrated. I ha -- I don™t 
know what to do. And of course
 this -- this public
 relations campaign about ma king every 
difference of opinion seem like an unpatriotic act 
has a very fa miliar ring to me . I heard this 
before. And there -- here we are 
celebrating 60 years t
il the end of the war. Where are we now?  
That was the war to end all 
wars. So it tastes very bad. 
Q: The taste for you after the war, is a very bad one.  
A: We ll, it™s only bad because as
 I say, this -- this 
was -- this was our hope for the future. We  
were not going to as a world, let 
this kind of thin
g happen again. 
Q: But that™s not true. 

A: And I don™t see it as true, and I s-see such --
 so ma ny simi lar me ans. Yes, not all. You know, 
there -- there aren™t extermina
tion camps, but we™re doing ma ny of the things in very similar 
ways, that have to me  a ring of danger. And I ne
ver thought that I would feel this way in this 
country, because -- and this is why I™m such 
a strong believer in an absolutely free and 
independent press. Because the pr
ess is the -- is the -- the only gui
de we have through darkness. 
And we depend on the press to l
ead us there so that we can ask the question and say to the 
admi nistration, how can you explain this?  How ca
n you explain that?  And as long as there is 
light on the subject, then you can stop it. 
But if you force peop
le underground, you don™t know 
what in God™s name  they™re doing undergr
ound. You don™t know what the Ku Klux Klan is 
doing, what the neo-Nazis are doi
ng, what the terrorists are do
ing if you force them underground. 
And if you -- if you contain the press and -- and se
ver its freedom, and -- or make it shut up and 
make it become an ar m of the government PR, th
en you can no longer trust the press to do that 

for you. 

Q: Wo w.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
127 
 
A: I™m not sure if you were particularly interested 
in this last, but this is why I™m feeling so -- I -- 
I don™t know what to do with my feelings about 
this. And -- and yet my commit ment  all through 
my professional life has been to support Constitu
tional liberties, the Bill 
of Rights, to teach my 
students, both elementary teachers and high school student s, the importance of listening and 
respecting the opinions of the child
ren in their classes, whether they abide by them or not. But 
that the essence of a free society is to listen and respect. 

Q: Right. 

A: And you stop your respect at a certain point of 
course, if that other side is preaching your 
death, or some body else™s death, then you say, th
at™s it. I don™t have
 any compunction about 
saying at a certain point that you have to restra
in that freedom if that person or group is 
preaching that doctrine that certain people should 
be killed. But ne-nearly up to that point, I™m 
saying you -- this -- this is the only guide we ha
ve to remain a -- a count
ry with the ideals that 
presumably we have led the world in and -- and 
ha ve tried to teach others. I mean, wha t  good is 
it to talk about democracy and then go in a
nd behave the way we™re 
doing and besides which 
there™s another piece of this teaching de
mocracy, which right now I don™t think this 
admi nistration has -- has reckoned w
ith, and that is that if you 
really preach democracy, you ma y 
end up getting an election some place with people 
that you don™t really want. But if you believe  
in democracy, if that™s what those people 
want, that™s -- you have
 to respect that. 
Q: Right. 

A: But we -- we™re not ready fo
r that. Can™t deal with that.  
Q: We  have to stop the tape.

Beginning Ta pe 10 
Q: I have a couple of questions, one is a small one
, one is a -- a some what  larger one. You have 
two children? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Two girls, boy and a girl? 

A: Boy and a girl. Girl and a boy, 
actually, in that order. Elizabet
h Anne, and Daniel Eric. And -- 
terrific kids. 

Q: Are they? 

A: Mm. 

Q: I imagine. 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: I™m going to ask you given what
 you -- what you™ve just been ta
lking about and talk about at 
various points in the 
interview, about what™s going on, wh
at -- how you see the world now, you 
talk particularly a-about this 
admi nistration, but of course in 
your lifetime, there was Ca mbodia, 
there was Rwanda -- 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: -- there was Bosnia and Kosovo, and ti -- East 
Timor, and now Darfore, I mean it goes on and 
on. When you think about it, do you think more a
bout Tante Toos and what
 she did?  That she 
took a very particular kind of action. She didn™t 
save the world, but she engaged in such a way 
that she risked her life, and her family
™s life to try to sa
ve three people.  
A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

Q: I mean does -- does -- do you think more a
bout how d -- how difficult it must have been? 
A: No -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
129 
 
Q: Nobody knocked on your door yet -- 
A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

Q: -- to say take me  in. 

A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. No, th
ere™s -- there™s no question about 
that, I -- I do th
ink about that 
enormously. I -- I think all the ti 
-- and -- and also actua
lly all the years that I was getting older 
and so forth, I kept thinking about 
what it must have been like fo
r my mo ther -- when I was 45 or 
some thing. You know, I would think, oh my God,my mother was such and such and age, and 

this is what was happening, and what would I do, 
and so forth. And I was also -- and I think I 
had very strong, not only values, but ideas, and also
 at the same  ti me , I think, wanted very much 
for my children to have as norma l -- whatever th
at really means, but as normal a childhood as 
possible. And so I -- I know I™m veering off your
 question a little bit, but I felt on the one hand 

that they needed to learn what I could express ab
out this from a learning point of view. So we did 
very little by way of Jewish tradition in the home,
 partly because I didn™t 
like the pulling apart of 
some  me mbers of the Jewish community and I di
dn™t like the sort of ex
clusiveness that one 
particular rabbi had -- had communicated. So we di
dn™t really want our kids exposed to that, so 
ours was by contrast a much more inclusive home, a
nd ther e was -- it wa -- it™s really interesting 
because l-Leas, my daughter has often said, you 
know, this community, or that community, or 
this group of people is -- is really the example of
 t he kind of values that you and Dad taught us. 
And so clearly there was a -- a -- a very clear und
erstanding of what those values were. And so 
we neither  the kids likes this exclusiveness that
 so me  communities will -- will --  will send out, 
will radiat e. And at the same time, I didn™t want
 them to have the burden that so ma ny children 
of survivors seem to carry. And I got to know 
about that, because as I was speaking around, so 
ma ny of the people came to me  and said, oh now 
I understand what my pa rents didn™t want to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
130 
 
tell me , or now I understand why it™s so difficu
lt to talk about the second World Wa r, or 
whatever, whatever, whatever. And likewise in Europe, where I™ve spoken in a number of places, 
including Austria, to hi gh school teachers, who sa id, we cannot speak to our parent s, they will 

not answer questions, they will not tell us where 
they were, and so on, or what they did. And at 
the same time I see that this pres
ents a special kind of burden, and 
I didn™t want to have our kids 
have that. Now this commit me nt to norma lcy, is that
 sort of -- that™s pr
obably not that unusual, I 
imagine any parent wants only the happiest and the 
best f-for their kids, and it™s not always the 
happy situations that build character, necessarily, but
 at the same ti me I made sure that the kids 
had a sense of -- of inclusiveness, of one world 
ideas about respect for other people. So much so 
that the kids were actually quite
 -- took on an activist role in sc
hool on behalf of other kids. Not 
Jewish kids, necessarily, but I -- you know, speak
ing up on behalf of some
one that the teacher 
was picking on. The teacher proba
bly didn™t even know he was 
doing it, and so on. And then 
also, I think, reflecting on the pr
esent role of Israel, vis-à-vis th
e Palestinians, taking classes in 
Israeli-Arab dispute. Tr ying to be informed a
nd to not be afraid to express an opinion in 

opposition to the Israeli government. Sometimes putti
ng themselves at -- on the outs with other 
Jews, perhaps. But I felt that that was terr ib
ly, terribly important. Now the same  goes for putting 
yourself out for some  of these peop
le. And so far, I have not been 
able to do that in a personal 
sense -- back to your original question, other than
 in the monetary sense. And w-we have as a 
fa mily, and as -- and my husband and I personally, have ma de big commi t me nts to IRC, the 

International Rescue Committee, which seems in a 
ma jor way to be helping refugees without any 
respect to what thei r country or their nationa -- 
their nationality or thei
r religion is, but going to 
those places in the world where people are desp
erate, where pe ople are suffering because of 
what™s going on, whether it™s intern
al or external strife, and so 
on. So we have done as much as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
131 
 
we could, maybe not as much as we can do, but stil
l hope to be able to continue to do, in those 
terms, which -- which are important. And my husb
and, especially, I think in a professional way, 
has brought the plight of the refugees to students,
 involved students in th
e work that™s necessary 
to save these people around the world. To do even
 small things, like volunteer to teach English 
as a second language in the local church or school,
 wherever the classes are being held. To -- one 
of -- one of -- wo -- actually she 
wasn™t a student of mi ne at Hamp
shire, but a -- a na -- a student, 
who became a student  of Peter™s, and worked in
 the refugee camps and extended herself to the 
point of taking a small inheritance that she 
had fr om her grandmother, and bringing three 
Ca mbodian wome n back, who had been raped an
d tortured and so forth. And adopting them, 
bringing them back, getting them settled, getti
ng them set up. Yeah, we™re not saving the world, 
but we are trying, and -- and I think sometimes when
 I have this great urgent sense of why a m I 
sitting here in a classroom, I think, well, some
body has to sit in the classroom and try to keep 
part of the mi ssion going that -- th
at we have got to change, and how do we do that. And that not 
everybody can run in the field, and do the me di
cal stuff, or do the actual whatever. And 
some how I™ve often felt that in my s mall way, give
n the values that  I think I™ve been able to 
communicate, even at the level of simply teachi
ng teachers to have respect for the child, which 
sounds as if it should be nothi
ng anyone would argue about. But if you watch clearly, you see 
that not every adult, and not every person who™s t
eaching, has that respect fo
r that child. Even if 
they are church-going and religi
on loving, and anti-abortion and so 
forth. Respect for that other 
life, and the fact that that life has a will and some
 sense and justification for some  freedom is not 
there a -- often, in spite of the espousal of these ot
her, so-called values. So I feel sometimes that 
ma ybe this is a rationalization, bu
t it is some thing I do believe I could do, and I could do it quite 
well. And so I felt that to throw in the towel was 
not the right thing for me  
to do, at least at tho -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
132 
 
in those years of my lif
e. I would like very much to be out
 in the field now, and -- and now is 
probably not a good time, having since had cancer and 
so forth. And I have to say that when I 
was first diagnosed with the cancer, a friend 
of mi ne said, oh Hedy, you™re a survivor, you™re 
going to ma ke it. And I have to say, although I 
understood perfectly where she was comi ng from, 
I quietly said to myself, why do I have to keep
 proving it all the time ?  But I -- I feel now 
some what medically compromi sed about going out in
 the field, but it is 
something that I thought 
about. I thought seriously about joining the Peace
 Corps after my kids were grown. And -- and I 
still reme mb er the horrible, hor
rible feeling I had during the Ko
sovo time, and when there was 
talk about the draft and my sonwas draft age, and I thought to 
myself -- and I didn™t say it out 
loud, but I just was devastated w
ith the thought that I lost the 
fa mily behind me , and now I was 
going to lose the family in front of me. It wa
s some thing I could barely
 confront mys e lf. And 
now I™m looking at my grandson. And if this conti
nues, he will be draft age. Jordy and Robert 
are the two sons of my son. And I-I just -- I can™t f
ace that. I just can™t face 
that. I just  can™t face 
that.  

Q: I hope you don™t have to. 

A: So do I. 

Q: So don™t throw in the towel, cause the towel 
is ma de up of ma ny differ
ent things, there™s not 
one towel. And I just wa nt to thank you very mu c
h. It™s been a long wait, 10 years, but it™s been 
more than worth it. And I thank you very much for spending the time  with us. 

A: You™re welcome. 

Q: Hedy, what is this picture here? 

A: We ll that is my very proud, as you can see, sc
hool picture, of that one
 year that I spent in 
elementary school after the war. And I™m growing 
my hair again, and so 
I™ve got the beginnings 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
133 
 
of some  skinny pigtails, and I™m wearing a dress 
that came over in a package mailed from m- my 
aunt and uncle from the States, in the classroom
, at a desk. And behind me is probably a ma p of 
the world, and on my head is one of those great big ribbons -- 
Q: Oh yeah. 

A: -- that I was describing to you, with a special 
pin that allowed it to 
-- you didn™t actually tie 
the ribbon around the hair, you just created the bow 
effect, and then put th
is very special pin 
around it, you see, and then you clipped it to your 
hair. So that was my -- my -- my dressing up 
for this -- this school picture.  

Q: Huh. 

A: And -- and tha -- it was a happy tim
e, and you can see there was -- 
Q: I can see it. Okay. Then -- 

A: And that picture is one of 
the first probably informal snap
shots of my husband-to-be and 
myself, whe n I was working as a counselor in th
 -- in the camp that hi
s parents owned at the 
time, and which we then ran later on, and -- and di
rected for ma ny years. At the time  I think he 
was a senior -- going into his se
nior year in high sc
hool and I was going -- no, I™m sorry, he was 
the senior in college, and I was a senior in 
high school. Or it could ha
ve been the following 
summer, which would have had us 
-- would have had him in gra
duate school, beginning graduate 

school, and have me  beginning college. I don™t reme
mber which of the two summers  that mi ght 
have been, but we were together -- now almost 
50 years. I mean, 50 years we™ve been together, 
but next year is our 50
th
 anniv -- wedding anniversary. And th
at is a picture -- and I don™t know 
who took these, by the way, either of these tw
o, but they -- we were 
given copies of the 
snapshots and the lower one was in my husband™
s wallet for ma ny, many y
ears, and my daughter 
now has put in a special request for a copy. The 
one above is probably th
e same  year or well, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
134 
 
probably not actually, cause I see that
 I had long hair, sort 
of pigtail like in the bottom picture, so 
it was probably still that first su
mmer. The upper one my hair is short, and I™m thinking this is 
probably around 1960, and we now have been marri
ed a couple of years. I™m running the camp 
along with Pe ter, and I think I have one child at 
that time . Tho -- this is just a casual snapshot, 
sitting on the lawn at the camp in one of those 
Adirondack chairs. And that
 picture is struggling 
with the bags, it looks like to me . I think we were
 comi ng from an extended stay in Italy at the 
Bellagio St udy Center, hence all those bags, b
ecause we usually don™t have that ma ny bags. 
Q: It says Norway. 
A: I think that™s not correct -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- but we were also in Norway for some  
period of time. Pet e r was teaching the Ame r ican 

studies program up in Norway, and that would ha
ve been sort of 90 s 
-- 1971, but I don™t think 
this is fr om Norway, I think this wa
s comi ng from Bellagio in -- in Italy. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And it was hot and humi d, and I was -- it™s 
one of ma ny, ma ny, many tr
avels that we™ve done 
together, and also that we ™ve done with the kids
, both of whom have an enormous appreciation 
of o-other people and other lands, and othe
r ways of living and behaving and so on. 
Q: And how -- wh-what y
ear do you think this is? 
A: I think this is more like early
 80™s, but I -- I could be wrong, it 
could b -- it could be late 70™s. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The reason I think it™s early 80™s is because
 I think my daughter had already gr adua ted and 
was living in Ital y at this time,
 but I™m not positive. But I do th
ink that wa s mi slabeled. And I 
hope it wasn™t in a book, therefore. But yeah, no, 
thi -- I™m sorry about the passport picture, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
135 
 
because had I been able to -- to br ing that, I w
ould have loved to have had you see that. And it™s 
not enormously different from this happy face here 
in the school picture. This picture by the way, 
is also at the Springfield Holocaust Museum. Bu
t -- but it is a wan little
, skinny little face -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and the smile is not quite as full. And there 
is this little tiny face, as
 I say, just swathed in 
this enormo us U.S. Navy surplus sweater, and 
-- I mean, there was th -- there was nothing in 
Amsterdam when the war ended, you know, th-the
re was nothing for thos
e stores, there was no 
clothing, there was -- I don™t even
 know how the hospitals operat
ed. And here, clearly there are 
th-the U.S. arme d services had come  to the 
hospital™s aid because I 
got the sweater in the 
hospital. 

Q: Uh-huh, right, right. 

A: So I must  have been gi ven the sweater -- and not for keeps, but because I was allowed 

outside, and -- and Holland is generally -- 
Q: Chilly. 
A: -- chilly.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And of c ourse, having just been so sick, th
ey weren™t a-about to ta
ke chances, but I was 
allowed to get in the air, and I was so weak th
at I was on this -- this
 settee thing. And I don™t 
even know who it was who ca me  to the hos
pital to take that
 passport picture. 
Q: Right. 

A: But -- but they did, and I -- I™m
 so happy that I have that pict
ure, because again, that -- that 
meant to me  this enormo us sense of gratefulness to
 this U.S. surplus stuff, this wonderful, warm, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0496  
136 
 
wooly sweater that I could have. And it was cold
 during the war, we had no heat, and I -- all 
those me mo ries were very close to that
 time  that passport picture was taken. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And -- and this picture as we
ll. I don™t know what the book is 
that I have opened on the desk, 

but it™s -- it™s kind of fun to look at myself w
ith that expression on my 
fac e , and it sort of like 
all™s well with the world again, you know, it™s so
rt of like, now here I am where I™ve been 
wanting to be all this time. 

Q: You™ve got a sparkle in your eyes. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah, they do sparkle. 

A: Yeah. And that™s -- an
d that -- the -- and the picture that -- 
a-again, I don™t have it, but I have 
a picture of my sister and me  toge
ther at this time as well, and th
ere is not a sparkl e in her eye, 
but there is a kind of gentle bei
ng at peace kind of thing. It is not 
a distressing face, but it™s not a 
sparkle, ne cessarily. But there is a sense of -- I --
 I -- I -- to me again, th
ere™s a sense of some -- 
some thing having come  to rest in a way, in her 
probably more than me , looking forward to the -- 
to going to the United States. 

Q: Right.
