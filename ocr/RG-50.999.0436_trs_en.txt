>> Michel Margosis:  W ell, IthinkI was like any other kid.  I wentto school.  I learnedabouthistory 
and geography and the language,how to speak French and Flem ish, and since Ididn't have m uch 
supervision, becausem y parents were tryin g tom ake a living in a new country, I was ableto roam  
through the city and got to know the city quitewell.  Even trying to sneak into theback of movies.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You became quiteam ovie buff ,didn't you?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  I becam eam ovie buff. I just love movies.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hodid you see in thosedays?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  I saw Tom Mix, if  anybody

a cowboy of  the 1930s, Am erican cowboy. W e 
didn'thave cowboys in Europe.  
 
[Laughter]
 
Ken Maynard.  In evening, Margaret T aylor.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Laurel and Hardy?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  T hey were all speaking French. W henI cam ehere, I was surprised to see 
Spencer T
racy speaking English.  
 
[Laughter]
 
It was natural growing up likeanybody else.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littleabout yourf ather.  He hadbeena policem an,now he's a 

newspaperman.  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  W ell, he was sent toSiberia, which I believe was Kazakhstan. Then he 

escaped. He arranged for 500 to escape, hewas one of 50 who survi ved.  Outof  500.  Hewalked 
through,all the way back to

actually, went to Palestine, through Persia, which is now a different

country, sam e place, different na
m e.  Very hospitable then. Today it is unm entionable.  But 
som ebody helped him to becom ea Persian citizen.  
 
 
Bef ore I was born, I was a Persian citizen already.  That seem s strange.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat becomes im portant later on. 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  T hatbecom es im portant, right.  Because of m y sister's problem s,m edical 
problem s, we thought
 
--
 
he thought it would be better to have care in Belgium . They seem ed tohave 
good medicine, especially around the coast. T hat's where we were, then he decided to settle there.  

Startedf rom  scratch.  He had nothing.  Managed to getf irsta little shop selling cigarettes and other 
things, thenhe became a newspaperm an.  As a newspaperman,he reported, he wasf irm ly against 
thefascism , com munism  and thenew r
is in g o f  Hit le r.  
 
 
He reported,he wrotestrongly against it. W hen war cam e, hef elt that he hada priceonhis 
head, andespecially being Jewish, andhe read the" Mein Kampf
,
"  the bookby Hitler.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henGerm any invaded, you rem em ber tha
t day?  
 

>> Michel Margosis:  Yes. W e were shopping, with m y m other, trying to buy me shoes. Bells were 
ringing. W ar is com ing.  W ell, Germ any invaded Poland. The next day, France and England gave 
Germ any a day to respond to their ultim atum. The ultim atum  was rejected, and September3,m y 
birthday gif t, France and England declared war on Germ any.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  On your birthday?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  On m y birthday.  I remem ber the Britishand the French troops com ing into 
B ru sse ls.   T he  B rit ish  w
ere singing " T iperari."  Rem em ber that song?  Andthe French were singing 
"W ho is going to washthe laundry onthe

T hat was the equivalent of the linethe French had. The Germanswent right through it. Also, around 
it, because Belgium  was there, so Belgium was in the way.  So France attacked Belgium.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatcan you tell us about the circum stances thatyou found yourself  and your f am ily 

and your comm unity f ound yourselves in when Germ any invadedBelgium  in May of 1940,and
 
what 
led, and you said a little about it with your f ather being both Jewish andan outspoken newspaper 

editor, the circum stances that led tof leeing Belgium ?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  My f atherdidn't havem uch choice, he didn'tthink.  He hadescaped 

c o m m un
ism once.  Heknew what that couldhave been liked. He had read about the plansHitler had 
for Jews.  As soonasBelgium was invaded,within a ver y short tim e we packedasm uch as we could 

on our back, walked to the railroad station, and we tried to get tickets, but the station was mobbed. 
W et r i ed  t o t a ke
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: W ith people trying to f lee? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  W ith people trying tof lee. I rem em ber sleeping on a suitcase. Thetrain we 
were going to take initially to the coastto go to England was too crowded.  We couldn't get on.T he 
ship we were going to take was sunkbefore itwas even leaving port.  
 
 
So we waited until wecould takethe next train, which went south, to a city called Morse, about 
half
-
hourf rom Brussels. W hen we got
 
there, the city was f lattened,com pletely bom bed out. W e 
were delayed, because two nuns were arrested. They were dressed asnuns, but they we re German 
paratroopers, soldiers.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dressed as nuns?

>> Michel Margosis:  D ressed as nuns. Thetrain kept going, seven days, seven nights, through 
France. People threw us food threw the window. W e were bom bedandm achine
-
gu nn e d a f e w 
tim es.W ef inally got to a sm all place calledCaz
e
res Sur Garonne.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout
 
that,tell usm oreabout thetrain trip.  You said youwere 
m achine
-
gunned. You were 
stra fe d
 
by planes?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Most don't know what thatm eans.W e were hit, som ebombings. My f ather 
pushedm eunder the seat.  Thought I wouldbe safe to not get hit by ricochet. Gotbackonthe train, 
it kept going.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember if  it was a terrif ying tim e as a11
-
year
-
old child?  It had to befor 
your parents?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  I didn'taskm y parents. As an 11
-
year
-
old, I don
't th in k an yth in g is terrif ying.  It 
was just an adventure.  W hathappens latertoo, I was justf ollowing m y fam ily.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  From there,af tera seven
-
day train trip, you end upin a sm all town.  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Sm all town, 70 kilom eters, roughly 45 m iles south of 
T oulouse
, which is now a 
b ig c it y.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Are you pretty well into France by this time? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Oh, way down.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  OK.  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  I had noproblem  communicating, because sam e language, southern French is 

just a little different f rom northern French, which is a littlediff erent from Belgian French. But it's like 
Am erican and English, the same language.

>> Bill Benson:  Doesa good job of explaining that. So what was your life 
like in t ha t  lit t le t o wn ?   
W as it f illed with other refugees?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  It was a sm all town. W e had afew ref ugees.  Idon't remember who took care 
of  it,butthe adm inistration sat us in the em pty house with afew bunk beds, with straw beds,
 co t s,  
nothing else. W ehadcom pany there, like anim als, little rats orm ice. We didn'tm ind them , as long 

as they didn't takeour food.

Michel Margosis:  W orld W ar I. W ell, I got acquainted with him later, when I was in the arm y.  He 
becam ethe chief of  state,and with his prim e m inisterI believe was Pierre Laveur, who was af ascist 

to start with.  I began that program ,butm yf ather thought going there we m ight get papersfor us. He 
had his own passport, but the passport m y mother had, had expired.  
 
 
W egottogether, andhe couldn't, so hefelt that we had to leave France as soon as we could, 
andhe wentto Portugal.  
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
He left at thatpoint?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  H e lef tus at thatpoint.

W eappreciated whatwe could get on thatfarm .  
 
 
T hen af ter a while

was your father gone which this tim e?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  H e went toPortugal. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was go

>> Michel Margosis:  H e was in Lisbon, trying to get papersf or us there.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W as he traveling underan Iranian or Persian passport?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  H e had a Persian passport.  My m other hadaPersianpassport, but it expired.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now your mom, your brothers and sister and you. 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  R ight.  From thefarm inFontenilles, m y mother decided we can't stay there. He 
said maybe there was a diplom at delegation in Marseilles, the biggest port in France, big city, and 
probably the second largest city in France. Then we 
would
 
enter Marseilles.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you went to Marseilles, Michel, at som epoint you were put into adetention 

c a m p.   
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Oh, yes.  
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: T ell us 
about 
th a t.   
 
>> Michel Margosis:  
W e ll ,  w

T oulouse
 
to connect with the train. We were advised 
there was adetentioncam p there the French had. W e were received there. W e werefed,andthey

assigned us som ebunks.  The place was m ore like anarm y squadron, the kind that can 
accommodate over 20people.  
 
 
Ever ything was f ine,but in them iddle of thenight m y m otherdidn'tfeel safe. She had som e 
angst, so she got everybody up. W e lif ted the tarpthat com prised the wall of  the tent, and we 
sneaked out.  
 
 
Lateron,through thework I do here, Ifoundout that most of the people that were there, 
possibly all of  them , were shipped to

were collected by thepoliceand shipped to Germ any.  
Probably to Auschwitz.   That was another escape we had. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm om  hadthe presence of m indto sneak youand your siblings out? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  She didn'tfeel right about it. It seem ed too easy.  
 
 
Also, I wanted tom ention thatonthe day thatBelgium  was
 
attacked, May 10, the Belgian 
governm ent sentout 10,000 refugeesf rom  Germ any, Austria,on the same day, toa concentration 

cam p in southern France.  I couldn't believe it.  Ifound this out too,because Ihad af riendwho was 
there.  He retired f rom  the
 
American arm y asa colonel. But heescapedf rom that cam p insouthern 
France.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So if  you hadn't lef t Brussels, you m ay have endedup someplace like that 
yourselves?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Oh, absolutely.

>> Bill Benson: T hatwas ri ght af ter you left, right?  
 

>> Michel Margosis:  T he birthday af ter I left. I lef t May 1940.T hatwas Septem ber1941. 
 
 
So I got to Marseilles
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  How were you able t
o travel f rom  
Toulouse
 
to Marseilles?  
 
>> Michel Margosis:  T ravels was still availabl e atthat time. You needed special pass, later on,f rom  
thepolice to travel anyplace in France. W hether totake abusf rom onetown toanother,or 
particularly train,
 
but to have a saf e conduct.  W hen we went to Marseilles, we didn'tneed it.  
 
 
W egotto Marseillesand we f ounda littleplace near the railroad station, but we considered 
slum s. The slum s were a good place,a safeplacefor people like us to be thereb
ecause the police 
were af raidto get in there. T he police were not safe inthose slum s.  The slum s was a very diverse 
comm unity, including opium
-
sm oking Chinese. We had,of  course,Arm enians, Arabs, Corsicans, 
ever ything you can imagine in thatneighborhood.  Exceptfor the police.  They were not there.  So we

Michel Margosis:  It m eant anally of  Hitler.  Many countries had right wing or ganizations.  In 
Belgium  we had the equivalent of afascist inFrance, in Belgium  wehadLeon

m oreactive with Germany than most of the other countries. But every country had theirown Germ an 
sym pathizers.

these people, several thousands, were picked upby the Frenchm ilitia and turned over to the 

Germ ans and sentthem  to Auschwitz.  T hatwas done by the French police, the Frenchm ilitia.  That's 
when he escaped and joined the French underground.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us m ore about your lif e during the period in Marseilles, and particularly tell us 
about your mother, who sounds like she wasan am azingly resourceful person.

my sister is f our years older, but

In Marseilles, asf oodbecam ediff icultto get, rationing cam e in, we
 
had a paper that we're

we had to survi ve on whatever we could. Tobe able tofeedourselves, to getf ood, m y mother

I was also able to goto the section where he lived, which was right by the oldport,and lotsof

help you. T hey'd pick up everybody.  T hey did that, I guess,all over the country.  I remember those, 
I escaped one in Marseilles becauseI knew how to sneakfrom  one how to the other without going

Michel Margosis:  N ovem ber1942, theAmerican allies invaded North Af rica, Algeria, Morocco and 
thefollowing day the Germ an troops were inMarseilles.  It's a pretty deafening sound to hear those 
boots in Marseilles. That was scary.  
 
 
W e im mediately pa

forged papers,telling us that m y sister, because of herm edical problems

neededm ountain air, and 
the Pyrenees offered goodm ountainair. T he Pyrenees,about 6,000 or 7,000f eethigh.
  
A i r  wa s  
pure. So we managed to go there with the papers, and we got ontoa train that was loaded with 

Germ an soldiers.  
 
 
Now, I hadnoproblem with m y siblings, m y brother and sister. W eall spoke French, like any 
native.  Butm y m other could speak only Russian and Yiddish.  Atone point, we decided to take a risk 
and started signing.  She didn't know how tosign, but shem adebelieve she was signing.  W etook 
her up on it, and we responded in kind.  So we were able to go through the several

W egotto theborder, stoppedatan inn, thenwe had after dinner two gendarmes, two 
policemenasking if we wanted to go into Spain.  Of course, we didn't. W e were French.W hy would 

we want to go to Spain?  Eventually, she relented, and tookuptheoffer to take usacross the border

So IdecidedbecauseI could speak Russian,I could help in the ColdW ar.  The arm y, the Russian 
m ay notbe goodenough, butthey'd sendm e to school to learn how to read and write.  I was 
disappointed they didn't needm eanym ore.  
 
 
So I looked at m y MOS, m y m ilitary expertise, anddecided thatalready I was already an 
interpreter, why send him  to Russian school? 
 
 
So everybody went toKorea, I stayed behind.  If inally got m y orders, then the first ship that 
went out went to Europe.  I didn't m ind going to Europe.  Instead, they sent me toGermany.  As soon 

as I got to Germ any, Isaid getm e thehell out of here, because I don't know what's going to happen. 
So they sentm e to France.  Crossed theborder.  France was still having Am erican troops. T hey put 
m eonone jobtranslating with a count, who was organizing a party for theAmericantroops.  So I was 
helping with that.
  
As soonas that wasf inished, they didn'tneedm eanym oreas an interpreter. They 
looked atm y records,see well, you have a degree in chem istry.  The chemical corps. That's a good 

place. SoI went to the chem ical corps.  I learnedhow tom ove the gas

how to move the sm oke grenadesf rom  thereto here.
