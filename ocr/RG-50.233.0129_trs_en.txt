Abstract 
 
Harold Charles Spear (Szpiro)
 
was born in Danzig, and confronted anti-Semitism by the time he was 
six and a half years old, in 
1924-1925. His schoolteacher forced him to sit down on spilled ink one 
day, and threatened to make him sit on a hundred t
humbtacks the next day.  Charles ran out of the 
school and refused to return. His parents sent him 
to live with his grandmother in the predominantly 
Jewish town of Pluzga, Pola
nd on the border with Germany.  
 
Later, he went to Lodz, and eventually biked all the way to Warsaw. He had tried to get a passport to 
leave the country, but was refused because he was draft age. 
 

He was sent to various camps. The head of a tran
sfer camp in Lublin shot anyone who looked him in 
the eyes. Harold ma naged to get himself and a friend 
sent back to their respective parents. But when 
Harold™s father told him Jews were not allowed to 
use sidewalks, Harold deci
ded to go into hiding in 
Chisava, 20 kilome ters away. He stayed with
 a farmer and then moved into the forest. 

 
His parents and little brother were pu
t into a ghetto in Pluzga. Harold 
wanted to take his brother into 
hiding, but hi s parent s refused because they thought
 Harold ha d a better chance of surviving on his 
own. They were taken eventually
 to an extermination camp. 
 
When Harold was taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, th
e first thing he saw was a corpse hanging on an 
electrified barbed wire fence.  Harold, a tool an
d die ma ker, worked in a machine shop. A kapo gave 
him 50 lashes with an electrical cord for helping 
a fellow prisoner. Harold became very close with a 
ma n so strong he could bend me tal rods. The ma n, Moka K, saved Harold when he was trampled in a 
cattle car going to Mauthausen. 
Its head SS ma n refused to take
 the prisoners, and suggested 
shooting all of them. Instead, they were ma rc
hed to Rodhausen, where Harold worked on V-1 
rockets. 
 
As the Russians approached, prisoners were load
ed onto barges and then were ma rched about 7 
kilome ters to the North Sea, where they were pu
t onto boats for a Germa n 
prisoner-of-war exchange 
with British forces. After the war, he returned to Germany, wher
e he found a cousin who was soon 
killed in a truck-train 
collision. Harold was tr
eated for ma ny months fo
r a painful neurological 
condition, but was eventually cured. He e migrated to 
the U.S. He did not like the fast pace of New 
York City so he moved to the St. Paul, Minnesota 
area, where he joined a friend. Harold ma rried and 
was about to celebrate his 40
th
 wedding anniversary at the time of the interview.

Today's dateisMay16, 1992 (in Golden Valley, MN).
 
I guess I'd liketo

out 
with--we're going to backtracka littlebitfr om allthis 
th at 
you've beentellingme . I 'd 
liketoknow a little bitabout 
your 
family, what kind of a lifeyou ledbefore the 
war, what 
your 
parents did, what lifewas lik
e at your house, things like 
tha t. 
If you 
want tostartwithwhereyouwere bornand justtakeit 
fro m t h e re.
 
 
Answer: Iwas born in a cityby thename  Danzig on the Baltic Sea. 
My 
father was a 
gra i n me rchant  and Danzigwas on the Balt ic. 
He 
conducted a lotofbusiness, 
shipping grain from Danzig to East 
Prussia and toGermany.Ireme mb ergood 
things aboutmy 
early 
years until Istartedgoingtoschooland Istarted feeling 
that 
I'm inthe wrong place. Some howdisplaced, Ididn't ha ve 
anyone who 
would 
take my side when I went to school. I f
ound my selfstanding up and the teacher told 
me  sitdown.  Iwas only six and a half y
ears oldandIsaidIcouldnotsitdown 
because 
someone 
spilled ink on my seat. Youbette
r sit down or el
se I'll come 
over 
and 
help you.ﬂ So Ihad to sit down andme ss up my  clothes.  When 
I 
ca me  homeand I 
told myparentswhat happened,theysaidma ybe 
it's 
anisolated case andwe'll see, 
maybe it will never repeat 
itself.  
The  next day, I cameand Ifound myselfinmyseat 
were 
thumbtacks 
one next to another where Iwa s supposed to sit. Again the 
same 
thing, Iwasstandingupandthete
acher said ﬁ s itdown.ﬂ  I said 
I 
cannot sit down on 
a hundredthumbtacks.ﬁ You be
tter sit down.ﬂ A nd Itold 
him I 'mnotgoingtosit 
down on thumbtacks.  He said ﬁ
I'l l 
c o me  over and help you.ﬂ Iran out the school 
and Iwent homeand Itold my parents, I'll never go back 
ther e.
 
 
Question: Youknewwhy?  
 
Answer: It was already under the German occ
upation. That was after t h e  1933plebiscite 
andthatwas thecount,who theywant to 
be 
under.  The ma jority supposedly 
voted to be under the Germans.  
I 
s t arted feelingtheGermans in1933already 
when thefirst 
ugly 
faces started to show up in th
e____andall thoseother hordes 
that 
ca me  marching down on that city.After that last episode, 
my 
parents 
decided that I'll haveto go and livewith my 
grandmother 
in the city of Pluzga 
(46) which was on the German border 
in 
Poland. Theyhada schoolthatwas 
just for Jewish kids.  
Pl uzga 
had apopulation of 5,000andthema jorityof the 
occupants 
were 
Jewish. It was probably 65 percent Jewish people. They were 
swarmi ng intothat citybecauseitwasonthe 
border  
and they could c onduct 
business. Thatwas beforethewar. 
Pluzga d
idn™t experience any problems in the 
thirties until 1939. They could freely go acro
ss the bordersbyhaving acertain pass. 
Theyconductedbusinessthereandma ny ofthe mwere doingtremendously 
well.
 
 
Question:  Just backtrack a littlebi
ttalking about--. You were 13 when 
you 
said---.  Sixteen is 
that what you said? Because Ithought 
you 
saidsix and a half,butthenyousaid 
1933 and I wasn't --and Iknow that 
you 
had to be older than that 
so--.
 
 

Answer: Yeah.ThatwaslongbeforeandImu
st stand corrected.  That's true. Bynot 
looking intowhat Iwrote,
 it gets all confusing. 
It 
was longbeforetheGermanseven 
walked intothatcity; 
they 
already had their ugly faces. Theywere all pro-German. 
Even 
it 
was a city that  wa s Polish and German.  The Poles had thei r 
ow n 
rules and 
regulations. We  livedin aGermanneighborhood and 
th e 
street was 
Jundergasser 
(74) and that's  where we  lived.  Yeah, 
I 
startedschool over thereandthatmusthave 
been probably in 1924 when I started 
school.
 
 
Question: Whenthosethingshappen
edtoyou?  Wa s thataround 1924or 
wa s 
that 
later?
 
 
Answer: Yes, '24, '25. Ican't  betoo specificabout it butthat's  when 
it 
happened and that's  
when Ihad to leave my parents and my 
younger 
brothersand go livewith my 
grandparents in Pluzga.  Lucky for 
me 
that Ihadagood school,rightacrossthe 
street from 
my 
grandmother's house. Iwas fortunatetomeetsome people, 
three 
sisters by the name  ofLandorf (88). Theywe re graduates of 
a 
se mi nary, Idon't 
know if that's how we called it, a 
teacher s ' 
college. Buttheycouldn'tgetworkin 
Poland becausethey 
were 
Jewishand theydidn't hireJe wishteachers. Theonlyplace 
where 
theydid hire them was ina Jewi
sh school. Like Pluzga, we had 
all 
Jewish 
teachers thereandIwasoneoftheirstudentsandthe 
other 
one  was another young 
lady bythename  Lipcha (98)Boglen. 
They 
ar e from________. Thosearethe 
two, 
they didn't do it  formoney, t heywere well-off because 
their 
fat her went 
to the UnitedStates.  Hewas a graduate 
engineer and hegotwork and hewasin 
Texas. He was doing very, verywell and he helped them out.  From what I 
reme mber, Iusedtogoup 
to 
their apartment. I reme mber an elderly lady always 
standing 
nea r 
the stove. The three girlsdressedvery, verynicelyand they 
were 
all 
tryingtohelpout.Theyonlytookonkids w h o  --andI 
don't 
know howmyna me  
cameup Œ maybe mygra ndmotherpassed the 
word thatshewould likeIshouldget 
same  help in preparing 
me 
for school because I was broughtupwith theGerman 
language and I wasn't  quite prepared 
to take onaPolish school. Polish was 
the 
domi nant 
language.
 
 
Question: Butitwas aJewish school?  Wa s it--? 
 
Answer: ThecurriculumwasPolis
h inaccordancewith allother 
schools. 
They ha d the same  
curriculum.
 
 

Question: Theonly difference was thatthe st udents 
were--?
 
 

Answer: Religion, which was    compulsory.     One       
 religion, 
Mosaic, Moses theycalledoverthere, 
the religion of Moses.    
 We 
learned the Bible, our Bible.
 And there was another school 
that 
the 
Poles attended and they 
had 
their own religion that they 
were 
taught. 
Polanddid notseparate state fromreligion. 
You 
hadtoattend areligious school. That 
school was, to me it was 
a 
Godsend, when Iwent inthere. 
 
I w a s  supposed to go in 
there 
right  
a fter I arrived over there but Iwasn't  prepared. Icouldn't 
speak 
the language 
properly.    I knew a few words but that wasn't
 enough not to be ridiculed by other kids.    

Those Landorf sisters 
prep ared  
me  to such an extent that
    I was above the first 

grade. 
 
The 
principal said,ﬁIcannotputhi
mintofirst grade because he 
knows 
so 
much more.Hewould be sleep
ing, he would have nothing 
to 
learn. So we'll start 
him out with the second grade.ﬂ And the same
 with that other girl, that Li pa–She 
also went into the third gr ade because she 
was a year older.  My
 recollections from 
that schoolwere all good. Ime t my  life-long friend by the name  Edek Z  (140). He 
was froma 
Jewish 
fa mi ly. They owned a largefarm,far mingcommunity, 
everything, 
lock, stock and barrel.  They had 2 0 - some  home s  in that 
area 
and ma ny 
acres of land. Mr. Zwas a gentlema n far m
er and theycalled himallkind ofna me s 
like lordship becausehewas 
one 
of the richest men in that city.  He controlled so 
much businessthat they didn't know how 
to address him. After Imet my friend 
Edek, Ist arted going totheirhome. Itwasanelabor ate home 
with 
ma ny, many rooms. 
They had things that norma lly other people didn't have likeagrandpianothattook 

up half aroom and all 
the 
kids got lessons in music, di
fferent--. Myfriendwasnot,did 
not 
_______ to music and he wanted to be free like a 
bi r d.
 
 
Question: So you we re friends in schoo
l? We re you friends
 in sc hool  a nd--? 
 
Answer: Yes,that's wherewemetandwearefr
iends s t i l l  today. HeusedtoliveinLondon, 
England. Now 
hi s 
residence isinSpainontheMe
diterranean. Thenhegotahome 
also on the west coast of England,where theweather is 
more 
t o his liking.He suffers 
from arthritisandhecannot stand 
th e 
weather in 
London.
 
 
Question: I want to talk to you a little bit more, justabout school 
and--. 
Did you stay in school, 
in Pluzga andyou went all the way 
through 
high 
school?
 
 
Answer: Yeah. 
 
Question: So you stayed there? 
 
Answer: Istayedthereunt ilIfini
shed theseventhgrade. The schools 
over 
there were seven 
grades.  Our curriculum was broader 
than 
nor ma l inotherschools. Welearnedso 
much thatitwas almost like high school 
equivalency.  
 
(Tape is paused).
 
 

Question: Youwere talking aboutschooland about--. Iaskedyou ifyou 
we nt  
through high 
school and you were sayingyou'd gotten to 
the 
seventh grade andweretalking 
about--.
 
 
Answer: Theschoolgaveusanedu
cation equivalenttoa highschool. 
When 
I finished public 
school, grade school,and I came to Lodz 
to 
continue 
--.
 
 
Question: Soyou were really young when you went to--when you started 
in 
Lodz?
 
 

Answer: Yeah. 
Seventh gradeis 
about 
13 or 14years old.  We didn't have a high school in 
Pl uzga. 
It's not like the United Stat es that any small community would 
have 
a high 
school or forthat ma tter, a college. Youhave togo to 
th e 
capital city to attend a 
college.  We  are not as pr ogressi ve 
as 
other countries. Russia,they had higher 
education in 
s maller 
communities. If Iwanted toattendanotherschool, Ihadto go 
out 
of town. The same  happenedtomyfriendEdek.He wentto 
coll ege 
and heattended 
a school, a trade schoolover therewhere he 
took pre-engineering courses. Iattendeda 
school that I felt would help me  if I ever s
hould come  to the United States, I'll be able 
to get t h e  same kind ofa job and beabletosupport myself.  It wasaschoolthatwas 
teaching peoplehowtomakenylonstockings. Atthattime , itwasinitsinfancy. They 
just started ma king 
them 
and itwasoneofthemost lucrativeprofessionsthatif 
some one 
wa nted to get into a good-paying job,to bea nylon ma ker, he had it  ma de. 
The school forthatwas pa id forby an 
American 
organization bythename  
ORT.  
My uncle's brother-in-law, rather sister
-i n-law, was the president of the ORT. 
Through her, I got a scholarship and I 
was able to attend because living in
 
another 
city and payingforschooling, eventhough my parents 
were 
not poor but itwas 
beyond theirmeans. Forme, itwas like 
a 
Godsend Iwasabletoattendthat 
school.  Also, in the evening, 
I 
went toclasseswhich Ilearnedthingsthat,ofhigher 
education, 
before college, likea juni orcollegeor somethingofthat 
sort. 
My time 
was quite taken upwith school
, trade school until about 
2 
o'c l ock.  Then from 4  
o'clock u n t il 7 o'clock, Iwas in 
a 
junior high school, not
 juniorhigh,junior 
college. 
Ialso went twice aweek to H ebrew 
education.
 
 
Question: Thiswas all inLodz. Howma nyyearsdidyouspendthere? 

 

A n s w e r :   I l i v e d o v e r th e r e  until t h e G e r ma n s ma r c h e d i n .  I fe l t t h at P l u z g a  d i d n ' t  
offer me  mu ch.  Itwas toosmallofacommunity. Iused 
to 
go backfor 
vacations.  I spent a few months and then I had to go back.  I sa w my 

parentsonce or twice a 
yea r.
 
 
Question: Howdidyourpa
rents feelaboutthat? 
 
Answer: I lived there with a family and theyrented a room tome. I 
ate 
over there, boarded. 
Itwasn't  an easy life but I feltif I 
wa nt 
to succeed inlife, I'll
 have to sacrifice 
something; that 
was 
playtime. Ihadmanyfriendsa
nd the only timewe could go out 
and havea good timewa s overtheweekend likeSaturday andSunday. 
We 
met and 
we used to go toa movie or some other placeof 
recreation u
ntil thewar br okeoutand 
that ruined everything. As a ma tterof fact
, in between time, my relatives in the 
United States sent 
me 
some pa pers to come to theUnit ed St atesasa st udent.I 
had everything ready, the only thing that I needed was a 
Polish 
passport. Wouldn't  
you know, thePolesrefused togive me  
a 
passport to go out of the 
country.
 
 

(A pausein 
tape)  
 
Question: Ijustwonderedwhyyoucouldn'tgetapassport?
 

 
Answer:  Everyone at the age of 15 
was consideredeligible forthe 
dr a ft . 
Consequently, Iwas 
in thatage bracketandtheyrefused to give 
me 
a passport. They said, ﬁYou cannotgo 
awaynow, our country isin 
mo rt al  
danger of being overrun by theGermans andwe 
need every 
able-
bodied person.ﬂ Theyrefused tolet 
me  go. Ihired an attorneyand I 
told them thearmy is goingto
 exist without Harold  Spear.
Th e y  
don't  need me, it 
didn't help.Ihadto 
st a y.
 
 
Question: 
Wherewereyou going togointheUnited 
States?
 
 
Answer:  ToNewYorkCity. Ihadrelativeswhowerequitewell-off. 
They 
had a fa ctory for 
me n'sclothing and _______.
 
The gentlema n w h o startedthe factorywas my 
grandmother's 
brother.When I w e n t  over therefinally,he was already dead 
and 
th e 
children had control over itandes
pecially one son,Nor manCohen,w h o  
wasrunning thatfactory. Hewase mpowered by his father™s Will.  N o r m a n  C o h e n  
promisedtogivemea job and educate me 
and teach me everythingandadvanceme in 
the business. Butthat was only 
on 
paper and that's as far as it went.Idon't know if 
I'm jumping ahead of myself. Inorder to cl arifythat,when I fi nally came 
to 
the 
UnitedStates, a letterwaswaiting forme that Ihavea job 
waiting.
 
 
Question: Thesame jobthatwaspromisedbeforehand? 
 
Answer: Yes,thejobthatIenvi sioned--hi sfather's 
Wil l 
specified there was a jobthatwould 
advance me  in that business. Every three months, I would go to a different place or 

they would put 
me 
into different areas of the busin
essso Icould learnit from 
the 
bottom up.  When I started to work in accordance with 
the 
provision, Iwas 
supposedtobeadvancedeverythreemonths. Itturned out I was working as a -- 

cutting clothforthecutterstocut 
it 
down for jackets or coats.  We  had to unroll 
it and cut it 
into 
certain sizes. Iwasthere fourmonthsandnothing happened. 
At 
onetime,afellow bythename Jacoby, a 
dista nt 
relative, cameover and said to me, 
ﬁYou know, I feel sorry for you.ﬂ  I said ﬁWhy? ﬂ He said, ﬁ Youknow you are 

starting outthesame wa y Istarted out 
in 
that business.   At that time  Nor man's 
father was running 
the  
business.  He toldme a l sothat he'sgoingtodothisand that 
and he never lived upto it. The same thingis going to happen to 
you. W
hat  I ™ mdoing 
now, this is my job.ﬂ He showed me  a broom. He said, ﬁYou'll wind up doing the same thing. 

Wh en they have no use fo
r you, they'll give you a br
oom in your hand and yo
u'll have to sweep the 
floors. You're 
young, run awayf r o m  h e r e . ﬂ  
This 
ismy  beginning comi ng tothe United 
St at es
.
 
 
(Pause in 
tape) 
 
Question:  Okay. You left off with--
you hadjustfinished talkingabout 
your 
schooling andyou 
finished describingwhat happened toyou up 
until 
the beginning of thewa r, ofbeing 
in school and all of that.  Your sc
ript startswithyourbicyclingto 
Warsaw.
 
 

Answer: I see. I biked all the way to Wa rsaw. Is it down?  Oh, 
oka y. 
When I arrived in 
Warsaw with the bike , Ihad a reception c o m m
i t t e e  ofGerman SSpeople, w h o  
stopped 
everyone 
from comi ng into the city. They
 diverted all the people to a 
city 
by 
the 
name
_____. Itwas a largecityand there was a German outpost that screened 
everyone w h o  came 
over 
there. Me being in theage thatthey thought ma ybe I 
would 
ha ve 
been a Polish soldier, I disguised myself as a 
civilian. 
Actually they 
didn't care, alltheywanted waspeopletogoto 
work 
for them and clean up all of the 
work thathadto bedone in 
the 
far ms.  Because all the able-bodied people were in 
the war. 
I'rn 
not sure if I brought this 
up.
 
 
Question:  It's  okay.  Go on.  
 
Answer: We ll, when we w e n t  overther
e, they sent us bycattle car and 
the 
citywa sSt          
(398). We wereassignedtoacamp,itwas 
all 
built with tent s and they putusupin 
tents.  Therewereabout 
150 
people assigned to each tent . The lodgingwas,we 
were lying 
on 
theground with a little bitofstra w 
as a ma ttress and one blanket for each 
person. At that time , itwas already fall and the 
we athe r 
got very, very chilly at night 
and being thatwe were near 
the 
Bal tic S ea,wefelt it very, verybadly. We had to 
ma ke the best of it.  I had a friend andwe joinedteams.  Hewas a 
barber 
by trade 
anddid barbering in the tent. S i ncemoney had 
no 
value forusbecausewe 
couldn't buy a n y t hing for it, he 
was 
bartering ahaircutorashaveforeither 
bread orablanket.Eventually,wewound 
up having enough blankets thatwe didn't 
feel 
the chill at night. Food wasme agerbutwe ma de it last. We  
got 
along justfine 
until oneday Swiss Red Cross people saw us 
in 
t hose tents. Theygavethema 
bawling out, ﬁ H ow can you do 
tha t, 
keeping those people in tents when you are 
freezing insidea 
house 
ifyou haven't got heat. That madethem do doublework 
and 
th ey 
put  up barracks and we moved into the barracksaroundDece mber. Itwas 
quite a difference from theway you lived in the tents. 
The  
tents, incidentally, h a d  no 
sanitary conditions. We  had to 
go 
out into a latrine that was in the open.  T hat's 
what 
reall y  
stirredthem up.Theysaidapersoncould freeze bythetime 
he  
goes 
anddoeshis physiologicalduty. Thebarrackswere putupat
 
a very fastpace andwe 
moved into them, only to find out 
a 
month laterthatwew e regoingtobeshipped 
back to 
Po la n d .
 
 
Question:  Wherewas the placewher
e you were,wereyou stayed?  Wereyou 
in 
Germany?
 
 
Answer: In Germany, yeah.  That was near Ste
tten (465).Polandclaime dthatthosearethe 
occupied terr itoriesthat theyused toown 
at 
one time. They followed allthe 
directions of Himmler on howto 
get  
rid of theJewish people. They putusup in 
rows and they 
ma d e  
everyJew come  forward. The gentileswere not touched, they 
toldthem to go back into the barracks. We we re putupon trainsandshipped to 
Poland. Wewoundupinacitybythename
 Lublin and itwasami serable camp. 
The SS fuhrerof thecampdidn't 
like any
one to look himintheeyes. Thatwasadeath 
sentence.  If some one looked him in th
eeyes,hetookoutagun and shot him 
on 
the 
spot. When I heard aboutit, I said I betterst aya mile 
away 
fr om hi m. Istarted 

lookingaroundand when I ca me  to the 
office, 
Inoticeda guy who looked familiar. I 
went overto himand Isaid ﬁare you by 
chance Zweig (497)Silverberg?ﬂ Hesaid, 
ﬁYes howdo 
you 
know me ? ﬂ   I said, ﬁYou ca me  once to our Betar (494)group in 
Pl uzga 
andyou ma de a speech and that'showIreme mberyou.ﬂ  ﬁ Oh,ﬂhe 
said, ﬁ
in 
that case, you deserve some thing special. Doyou 
want 
to go backtoyour parents?ﬂ I 
said, ﬁOf course I would like 
that.ﬂ 
He said, ﬁ I 'llwork outthepapers foryou and 
you can go back 
in 
two 
da ys.ﬂ
 
 
Question: Wereyou inawork camp inLublin? 
 
Answer: That was a transitcamp where theykept
 on shipping p e o p l e  i n  different directions. 
IfIwould have toldthem that I 
don't 
have parents, thatIdon't haveanyonetogoto, 
Iwould have been shipped to a camp, a steady camp to stay there.  But as long 
I 
insisted Iwanted togoback tomy parents, theyma de out 
th e 
papers for me . 
Before Ilefthisoffice,hesaid,ﬁYouknow
,looking at the listing here, Isee thereis 
another person here from 
your 
hometown by the name  Josef U        (529).ﬂ  I said, 
ﬁOh myG-d, 
I 
know him very well.ﬂ The ma n s a id, ﬁI'm going to ma ke out the 
paper for you and him and you'll both go the same time.ﬂ Sure enough, two days 
later 
they putuson a horse and buggy 
and took us to the station.  
They 
told us to take 
off theyellow starsbecausewewould ha
ve beenharassedeverywherewewould 
havegone. Wewenton that train and four 
hours later wewere at ourdestination. 
The areawhere 
we 
stoppedwas never usedfora stopexcept ifsomeonewanted to 
get  
offat that place,othe rwise itwasgoingthroughwith that 
area. 
We  got off in there, 
nobody else.  Iwas hoping that we mi ght be 
ableto find someonegoingthesame  
direction to hitch a ride but luck wasn't with us. At thattime, goingat nightwas ano-

no. If 
they 
caught some body walking at night, they didn't ask 
questions, 
they just  
shot them. We  tookagreat riskandwewalked 
11 
kilometers tothecityof 
Pluzga and luck was with us that we 
didn't 
seeasingleperson.We  w e n t  toour 
destinations; hewent to 
hi s 
house, Iwent tomy house. Iknockedonthedoor 
and my father cameto the door and saidﬁWho is it?ﬂ  Isaid, ﬁIt's me,Harold.ﬂ  ﬁ
Oh 
my G-d,ﬂ he yelled out.  ﬁ You wouldn't believeit, our son is 
here!ﬂ 
He opened up 
the door and it was one o'clock and we  spend ma ybe four hours o v e r n i g h t  

remi niscing a b ou t  what h a d  happened.  We talked a lot and finallyin the early 

morning, Iwent 
to 
sleep. I sl ept u n til about 8o'clock in themorning. T
hey 
told me 
that in themorning, every 
able-bodied personhadtogo 
out 
and do somework for 
the Germans. They kept a closewatch 
on 
everybody andif thatpersondidn't 
come  out, theywanted to 
ma k e  
sure that he's not skippingtown ortrying to get 
away 
fromworking. My fathertoldme , ﬁ Y ou better goandbewith 
the 
group.ﬂ SinceIwasnewinthatc
ity, they ask me what kind of 
work 
I could do.  I had 
a background in tool and die ma king. Itold
them that Itook it upintradeschool. 
They said ﬁ O h, a guy 
like 
you, we could use.ﬂ They assignedme to organizea 
group of peoplewho have some  knowledge a
bout how tofixtheir stuffthatgets 
da ma ged. 
They said, ﬁWe can giveyou a lotofworkandyou'll bebusy. 
You're 
going 
to have a betterquality of living than all theothers 
have 
because you'll be working for 
the German army.ﬂ That didn't 
impress 
mea bit. From theday I w e n t  overthere, 

when Iwent outin 
the 
st reet, myfather said,ﬁYou'renot allowedtowalkon the 
si de wa l k. 
You havetowalk inthegutter.ﬂ 
 
Tape I ,  SideB
 
 
Answer: Whenhetoldme that,Ifeellikesome onewouldhavejabbed 
me 
straight inmy 
heart. ﬁ Whatdoyoumean? ﬂ Isaid.ﬁ Whycan't I 
walk 
onthesidewalk?ﬂ  ﬁThat™s 
the law. Go and argue with them.ﬂ So 
when 
I heard that, all the promises they made 
to me , t h a t  I'mgoing to 
ha ve 
good e a ting and good lodgingandwhatever else, 
as I said, 
didn't 
i mpress meatall.  Istartedto
 lookaround and see if I can find a 
placewhere Ican hide out and be surethat Icanma ybe 
live 
through the war. I 
me t a fellow w h o  was working nearby where Iwasandhesaid,ﬁI havethesame  

idea, Iwould like to get away 
fr o m  
t he city.ﬂ Sure enough a fewdayslater,we 
packed a few 
things 
tha t we had and we went 20kilome ters from thecity. Itwas 
an 
area bythe name Chisava 
(16).
 
 
Question: Didyourparentsknowthatyouwere 
going?
 
 
Answer:  Yes.   I told my parents. They tried to talk me out of it but 
the y 
felt if Ican help 
myself and hopefullysurvive,theysaid by 
all 
means. ﬁWe aretoo old tostarta 
lifestyle likethat,notto 
know 
where we are going to sleeptomorrow,whereyou'll be 
the next 
day.  B u t
 if you feel you can do it, by all means go ahead.ﬂ I 
went 
with 
the fellow onenight andwewound upthere one earlymorning.  We  wenttoseesome  

people who used to live there before thewar, by the 
name 
Boldratt (26) . They 
r e c o m m e n d e d stayi ng wit h a n elder ly pe rson wh
o was handica pped a nd us ed a crut c h. Boldratt 
saidyoumay have tohelphim outmany time sbecause some times
 he  
cannot get 
off the bedbut oncehed o e s getofft h e b e
d  andyou putthecrut
ch underhisarm, 
then he'sall right. We stayed with 
the m , 
with that farmer. Of course,we hadto pay 
him and sinc ewe 
didn't 
have money t o pay him and hedidn't want no money ____. He 
said, ﬁI  
can't 
buy nothingwith themoney that
 you'll give me .   I nee d 
some 
provisions, somethingthatIcoul
d useinthehouse. Ifyou 
can 
give me somethi ng 
like meator sugaror someother foods, 
that will be  greatly appr eciated.ﬂ So we 
bartered with him for 
the 
lodging andwe stayed a few monthswith hi m.  Untilone 
day, 
whe n 
we wentout, wesaw asignfromtheGermans t h a t  saidanyone who could 
help deliver aJew tothemwould get fivek
ilos o f  sugar. Iknew t h e n  that our stay 
over therewould be limited, but we 
didn't 
giveup. We went andmoved intothe 
forest, dug in there; 
we 
made a  tent, improvisedfrom some trees. We started 
housekeeping inthe 
fore st.
 
 
Question: Itwasstillwinter
 whenyou started,wasn't  
it?
 
 
Answer: Yes,whatwe  did is,we dug anareathatwasma ybe fouror 
five 
feet into the 
ground. Itwasn't  easy becauseeverywhere we put 
a 
shovel in,therewas atree in 
theway there. We  hadto chop 
it 
outandwe didn'thavetools,proper tools. But 
in order 
to 
feelwarm, we felt thatwe™ve got to go underthe ground so that 
w i ll 
protect us. That'showwema naged to 
build some  kind of l odging that we could 

stayinthereand feelthat theelements are 
not  
going tobeagainst us. Istarted 
going toa citybythe 
na me  
Bi (64) whichwasalsoabout25kilome tersfrom 
Chisava. 
That area was called bythe German
s, itwasnotanintegrated 
area 
that 
 they 
claime d was their possession. Chisava was 
their 
possession, Bi      they claim isa 
protectorate.  Theywanted 
to 
make the people vote forthem incaseitwill ever 
come to a 
vote 
to showthat theyarewilling tostaywith them. That's 
why 
they'r ecalled protectorate.   Germans  werehopingthateventually 
the 
publ ic w a s 
going to be voting for them to re main over there.              
 
I 
went overtothatcityandIhadmy father's cousinbythe 
na me 
Rus s ik (76) and 
we were told that sugar is in abundance over 
ther e. 
Youcan get asmuch asyou want. 
We figured out that I'm going togo, that my 
friend Bro (80)willst ayintheplace,just 
in 
casesome thing, a me ssage orsome thing else , some onewill have 
to 
bethere.  The 
fi rst tripwehadtocrossaborder and it was 
uneventful . 
It didn't bother us at all, we 
justslippedthroughtheborderandtheRussiks were very niceandthey 
accommodat e d me and helped 
me 
alsotofindthesugarthatIneeded.  Ispentmaybe 
three or 
four 
daysover there justtogetalittlerest and then Istartedon the 
way 
back.
 
The way backwas a little harder. We had to hire 
some body who 
would transport 
the sugarandmake surethatthat t h e  sugarw a
s 
not going to be seen.   
  
He put some  
sheepin thewagon and hid the sugar 
unde r 
that double floor. 
 
We  couldnot gowith him 
because wewere Jewsandhewas aPole, a n d  transporting 
Jews 
would have 
c a used him problems
. 
I went by myself and a number of other people who would 
try to cross the border with some one w
ho knew the area and also knew when the 
guards were changing.  We ma de it across the border and I me t up with that ma n who 

was carrying that stuff.  He was recommended by Mr. Russik, who knew hi m from 

before the wa r.  He said ﬁHe is beyond 
reproach, you don't have to worry.  When you 
get there, he'll wait for you and he'll have it for you.ﬂ  Sure enough, when I went back 

to Chisava, he told me  where he™s going to
 be.  There was only one beer joint. He 
said, ﬁ I 'mgoing tobe inthat 
beer  
joint.ﬂIwent overtohimand hehad that stuff 
for me . 
 
I paid him and Imade arrangements that I'm going to use him again 
next 
time.   Myfr iendBro and I pickeditupand 
we 
took it over. Peoplewerealready 
waiting forit. 
 
Of course, not for mo ney but bart
ering forotherfoods.What 
we 
wanted ma i nly w a s baconand ham.Those arethe items thatwe 
are 
l acking, 
everybody was lacking.  But the farmers had 
 it in abundance.  They'r e putting it away 
and hoarding it.  For the sugar, we got all that stuff that we needed.  I took off that 

stuff that we got and we hid it.  A few days later, I had a me ssage that my  

grandmother was very sick and she was not ex
pected to live another day. I f i l l e d  a 
knapsack with a number  of provisions. My
 
father and mygr andmother were very 
religious and theywouldn't  
eat 
it .But the rabbi told themthat  if it  isa 
life -
threatening 
situation you are allowed to 
eat haza (pig).
 Ibroughtit 
ove r 
and my 
grandmother, it was like she waited for me.    She was still 
aliv e  b u t 
she didn't last the 
next night. She justfellasleepand 
ne ver 
woke 
 
up.   
W e w e nt to the fune ral and my 
parents had some provisions.  My fa ther woul
dn't eat any of that ham or bacon.  My 
mother and my little brother ha
d it. I didn't w a nt to s ta y 
long because every so ofte n 
the Germans used to come and see who is 
alive and who is dead, to keep track of 

how many people are still le ft. 
 I was afra id that if they 
run into me, I'd be in bad 

shape because no young people we
re there, only elderly pe
ople.  I slipped away the 
following night and I went b
ack.  Before I le ft him, my fa ther told me news wa s 
spreading that they™re going to
 liquidate the ghetto. ﬁIt'
s only a matt er of maybe a 
week, two weeks. I'll let you
 know. There are always so
me people that go over 
there and I'll le t you know
 in plenty of time.ﬂ 
 
Question: Was this in Pluzga?  A ghetto
 in Pluzga?  I didn't realize that. 
 
Answer: Yeah,yeah. They putthem upin barns. Mygrandmother hadto 
move 
out o f  her 
house that sheoccupied ma ybe f o r  50years.
 H e r children werebornthere. Shewasin 
verypoorhealth. There was onlyonething 
that 
they allowed her totakeand itwas--
the Germansaid, ﬁ I 'mgoing 
to 
turn my back. Y ou carry the bed out for the old 
woman.ﬂ 
He  
called heraverydemeaningname . 
 ﬁ
Take thebedoutbut Iwo
n't 
see it.ﬁ
 
She lived in a barnwith all the other Je
wish people. Therewere ma ybe ten barns 
on onestreet.M
y 
parents, mygrandmother anda few 
otherpeopleoccupied one barn. 
Justlike my father had said, they let 
us know that the ghetto will be liquidated. 
They would like very muchto seeme  beforet heygo. AgainIwentthroughthe 

night and metwith 
the m . 
The followingmorning, justa s scheduled,thehorsesand 
buggies were lined up for all the people to be taken away.        I wa nted to 
be  
with them as 
long asI 
could. 
The guy who carried my 
parents, 
I knew him from befor e  but he 
pretended hedidn't know me  so Iwouldn'taskhi mforanyfavors. 
 
I didn't need any 
favors fro m 
hi m. 
I justsat on that buggyof his. 
 He said, ﬁIdon'tknow that you 
are 
there 
and Idon't wanttogetintoanytrouble.Ifyousee 
a 
German comi ng, jump 
off.ﬂ  I only wanted to get closer to 
that 
village, ChisavasoIwouldn'thaveto 
walk so 
much. 
Iwentbackto say goodbye to my parents and Iwent backto 
Chisava only 
to 
f i ndout that theyw e re expectingtobe overrunby the 
German
s
. 
Apparently,thefivekilos o f  sugarwe
re tootempting tothePoles s o  they 
gave usupand toldthemwherewe w e rehiding. 
The 
following morning,the 
Germans ca mewiththedogs.
 
We  he ard 
th e 
dogs  fromadistance s o  wehadachance 
to 
hi de . 
We hada 
couple 
of guns, a mmunition and some  other things. 
 
We buried 
it at 
a 
distance soasnottobefoundwithitbecausethatwould 
ha ve 
me a n t  a  
death sentence. They took us also by horse
 and buggy to a city nearby, where people 

fro m all  
th e  
ghettos intheareawerebrought.When Iw e n t  
ove r 
there, a fellow I 
knew said,ﬁYouknow, I  justsawyourmo mand dad andyour little brother.Isaw 

them over 
there. 
Ifyou gowhere I point, to a group of people,you'll see 
your  
fat her and 
mother a r e  over therewithyour little 
br ot her .ﬂ
 I 
went 
over a nd I hada premonition 
thatthis would be the last that Iwill 
ever 
see 
the m .
 
 
Question: Didyouknowwheretheyweregoingtobegoing 
then?  
 

Answer: 
I knew. 
 
Where we were living wewas abletoget newspapers. 
 Ther e 
was a little 
underground move me nt.
 
We gotsome information through our radios that they'r e 
trying liqui date 
ever yt hi ng 
and they already told us,thePo
les, that theyare going to use 
ga s 
to exterminate the Jewish people. Isaid,ﬁMyG-d, how could 
anyone 
do something 
likethat?ﬂ Well, that'swhat they'r e planning to 
do. 
The firstthingthatwe foundout 
is that  they were crude.
 
They 
were taking inpeople intotrucksand theyhad the 

exhaust 
pipe 
going into the truck s o  carbonmonoxide theykilled them 
in 
the truck. 
M y  pa r e nt swe r e  t a ke nt o a cit yby t h ena me  
Helno 
(240).      I didn't find out until I 
went to Israeland met a 
guy 
from that city where they 
brought
 all of them over 
there 
and 
shipped themtodifferent extermination camps. Hesaid,ﬁ I worked 
in 
that 
camp and Isaw 
them. 
There wasnothing Icoul d dobecause about four p e o p l e  
w a t c h e d  everyJew, sotheyshouldn'tdoanythingthatmi ght 
jeopardize -- 
might 
rescue some body.ﬂ He said, ﬁ I can
giveyou theexact date when 
th e y  
were 
killed.ﬂHesaid itwasRoshHashanah, the firstdayof 
Rosh 
Hashanah whenthey 
killed them.
 
When Isawmyparent s, I 
be gge d  
them to let me take my little 
brother.He had so muc h to live 
for 
and I felt he was so bright, if he would have 
lived, he was 
a 
wizard inarithmetic, math. 
 
Hecould multiply something and give 
me the answer before Icouldevenwrite 
it 
down. 
I 
felt itwoul d besuch awaste to 
let somebody like that  fall 
into  
the filthy hands of theGermans. My parents said, 
ﬁYou by 
yourself 
have abetter chance thanwith 
him. 
Besides, he's tooyoung, 
he 
needs parents.ﬂ
 
I didn't  want to tell them wha t  Iknew. It 
would 
have only put 
fear into 
them.
 
I left  with that and said 
goodbye. 
I was loaded up on a truck and we 
went tothe city of Lodz and 
my 
parents    were  taken 
 
away  to  that  city 
 
of   
 
Helno, 
 
that 
 
was 
an 
extermination camp. When Icame to
 the city of Lodz, I told the 
guy who 
was recruiting the people, afellow bythename  Beeboff 
(284), that 
I hada 
background intoolanddiema king.
 
He was 
 
the head of the ghetto in Lodz.
 
He 
said, ﬁ
I could 
use 
somebody with your experience.ﬂ 
  I went with a number of 
ot her  
people and 
we went 
into that ghetto.The fi rst stopwas 
the 
administration 
office for the people who were    shipped   into       
 the 
ghetto.    They put d o w n e veryone™s 
names,   where they came from, the age, pr
ofession, or what they can do. While I was 
looking atthe 
people who 
cameout o f  thatoffice, Inoticed myuncle,Morris 
Frelich 
(298). Itried tomo tion tohim buthewas busywriting but 
finally 
he 
noticed me  and I went over to him. He said, ﬁOh no, you're 
not 
goi ng 
anywhere. 
 
You're comi ng toour house and you're going 
to 
work inhere.ﬂItold 
him that Ipromised to 
work 
for ametal shop. 
 
He said,ﬁDon't worry, aslong as I'm 
here you can stay in here.  This job is much 
easier than to go and work in a factory,   a 
metal fabrication factor y.ﬂ I was th
ere with him probably two months. 
 

Question: Two months  before th
ey liquidated- -before the deportations st arted, is that  it? 
 

Answer: No, the ghetto was not liquidated. The ghe
tto was still in existence I think for about 
eight months. 
 
Question: But before they started taking the ___(316)? 
 
Answer: Yeah,somyjobwastounpackthesuitcasesofanyonew hocame 
in. 
I didn't 
have anything, I didn't have to put anyt
hing down.  But there were some  people 

w h o  ca melikefromVienna,from 
Rolland, 
from manyother cities w h e r e  
they h a d  livedanorma l life.They 
were 
not persecutedaswewere. They 
came with suitcasesjammed 
with 
all kinds of stuf f. I couldn't believe it, so much 
st uf f.    
The 
Germans were standi ng there,tryingtomakesurethatweare 
not  
going toswipeanything. 
 
They told us that if they catch anyone trying 
to 
take 

something from those suitcases and put it in his 
possession, th
ey'll shoothim 
on the spot.   It was so tempting and I knew if 
I 
could get my hands on some thing 
like that, Icould probably live u n
til 
the end ofthewar bybartering that for 
food.  
 
One ti me Ihad 
a 
chance, Itookoutsomeea
rrings andsome othergems 
and I 
stuffed 
it in a crack of the table.     Then, when we were done with the 
work, 
I 
took itoutandtookitinto 
the office and hid itthere. 
I 
thought whati f  
some one finds it.  Well, luckily it 
was a good hiding place. It was there 
when we finally gotour papers that 
we wer
edonewith thework over there 
because nobody was shipped into that ghetto anymore andtheywere starting 
liquidation of 
the 
ghetto.   I went to that office, took it out, put it in my 
pocket 
and walked home. 
 
Ididn't say anything tomyuncle. 
 
He was 
very 
fearsome  a nd he told me  ti me  and time again,ﬁDon't 
do 
anything thatcould 
jeopardize yourlife.I'm 
responsible 
for you so listen to 
me. ﬂ 
But Ifelt 
differently and I thought if I'm going to be
 able to take some thing like that, it 
will 
prolong my life. I hid it at th
eir house w h e r e nobody could find 
it 
and itwas 
there for amonth.I star ted to work in that  
metal 
fabricating 
shop. 
The shop 
was justashell,therewasnothing 
in 
there because the machinery had been 
pilfered bytheGermans.They 
took 
it out and shipped it to Germany. But  since they 
wanted tohave 
us  
work forthem,theybroughtin 
new machinery.   We had to 
mount 
that machinery back on the __. I was called in by a fellow by 
the 
na me  
Pl _
__   
 
(374)  who  
was thehead ofthat departme nt. 
We 
started mounting eachof 
the machines. 
 
Because ofthatmounting, 
I 
went down underground 
 
 because in 
order tohave 
those 
machines sit stable and not move, we had topour 
foundations, 
ce ment foundations. 
 
Isaw that theplace could beaterr ific 
place 
to 
hide out inthe future. 
 
I was only going around and 
thinking about 
how t o  
evade them?  H ow t o  get away from the m without falling into their 
tr a p ?
 
Whenever Isawsome thing,Ima dea 
mental 
note of it, to go back into that place. 
 
We finished mounting 
 
that machine 
 
and
 
then
 they    transferred me  
to
 
a 
different 
departme nt thatwasmo rethethingthatIusedtodo. 
We 
were trying toma ke 
bottles fortheGermansbutthebottles 
that 
they were having ma de had      
to go through five or six 
different 
processes.  It took a long time and ma ny 
ma n-hours andtheygave 
us an 
assi gnment tomakebottlesfortheGermansthat 
could be 
mad e  
in two operations.
 
Sure enough, weworked outadesign whereby 
we 
took along pieceofwire andwithtwohands,webent that 
wir e 
and we 
made thatinsert inth
e mi ddle tobuckle on the 
letter. 
They were very 
satisfied withthat -- likeIcaredalot. 
 
We  ma de 
a 
good i m p r e s s i o n  o n  
them. W he never they came,they said, ﬁ W hat you did; 
we 
are smart butyou 
are smarter thanwe are.Youknew how todo 
it 
in such ashort time.ﬂIt tickl ed 
me .   

 Iworked in that 
department 
for a few months.    When I we nt to work one day, 
I noticed 
so m e  
signs t h a t  s a i d  theghetto w a sgoingtobeliquidated 
and 
anyone w howantstogetareal 
good job,theearlierhegoes, 
the 
better the job 
prospect w o u l d  be.Forme , thatwas 
no 
inducement.  I felt thatas longas I 
can stayhere, I'mgoing 
to 
stay. If Ican stayuntil thewarisover, that will bebetter 
ye t. 
One day, our director from that factory came inand saidwe 
are 
going tostop 
work atthreeo'clockbecausewe havetogot o 
be 
presentata publichanging.  I 

startedtoinquire, a s k i n g  ﬁ W hat 
is 
that public hanging? ﬂ They
 toldme therew a sa 
fel l o w fro m 
acr oss 
the street. They were making forthe 
hor se s-- .
 
 
Question: Bridles? 
 
Answer: Yeah, 
whatever.
 Theyused togeta lotof leathersotheycouldma ke things for 
them. One guy w h o  didn't have shoelaces cut 
a 
piece thatfell off, so he triedto 
ma k e  a  
shoelace.
 Theysawhim 
and 
thatwas good enoughreasonforthemtohanghim 
for t h at . 
 
We  
went 
to a place in the ghetto where it was sparsely occupied because 
it 
was only landandit was calledMarishein(470).Allthegoodsfortheghetto 
were 
shippe d in there. 
 
I always kept 
my 
eyes open.   I wanted to find a place where I 
can hide that 
nobody 
will be ableto fi ndme. 
 
I saw over there they had some  
warehouses w h e r e  a personcouldhideand probablylivethrough 
the 
end of the 
war. 
We  kne w the war is comi ng to an end butwe 
didn't 
know howlongit's going 
to last.It o l d a fellowfr om 
our 
factory, ﬁYou see this placeover there. 
 
It'll be 
an 
ideal place tohideout.ﬂ The firstthing heasked me , ﬁ W here 
are 
you goingtoget 
the food 
fro m ? ﬂ
 
 
I said,ﬁWell, that's something 
we™ve 
got towork 
out.ﬂ 
 
He said, 
ﬁ H ow™reyou going towork it out?ﬂ
 
I 
didn't 
want totell him that Ihavesome jewelry 
that I could barter, because 
you 
didn't know who you can 
trust.
 Idecided that it's not 
going 
to 
work out forthesimplereasonthat
 you j ust cannot get food. Itwas 
a 
bad      time 
to barter because everyone was thinking a
bout being shipped out and they didn'twant 
to becaughtwith jewelrybecause rightaway
 they would ask themwheretheygotit. 
Nobodywanted to buyitatthat timeor
 barteritfor food so that fell 
through. 
Whe n  
we r e t u r n e d  thefollowingdaytothe 
fa ct or y, 
that fellow that I helpedtomount 
machinery 
ca me 
to me . He said, ﬁYou know
 we got anorder to 
dis ma n tl e 
the 
machinery. They told ustwoweeks is all we are going to 
get. ﬂ 
I said,ﬁ You must be 
crazy, two weeks.   The machines weighed 
tons,  
how canyou--it's 
impossible.ﬂ 
He 
said, ﬁ T hat'swhattheytold 
me. 
We started todi smantle smaller andlarge 
machines. 
By the time 
we 
got 
ha lfw a y ,  
the twoweekswere over. 
 
The Germa n came in 
and 
startedswearing andhesaid, ﬁI'mgoingtoshootyouall.ﬂ Iknew 
he 
wouldn't do 
itbecause he couldn™tget anyone else todo it. 
He 
begged  the Germans, that

(

  he says, ﬁGive us another two weeks. He said, ﬁYou must be 
crazy.  I'll shoot 
you 
first before I'll giveyou twow
eeks.ﬂ  We started working at 
a 
little f a s ter  pace than before. Two weeks we
nt by and we still didn't  have that  
done.  Another two weeks and we didn't ha
ve everything dismounted.  That Mr. P  
came begging us, ﬁPlease, please. They threatened me  with execution if I don™t force 
you to work at a pace that will ge t everythi ng out of here within a fewdays.ﬂ Iknew 

that bycooperatingwiththem, thes o o n e r  
we 
get done, the s o o n e r  I'll have to go to a 
concentration camp. 
I 
feltif I can prolong itforanot
herweek or twoweeks or a 
month, 
that would be much better forme
 than goinginto theconcentration 
camp.
 
 
Question: Hadyouheard,intheghetto,hadyouheardaboutwhatthe 
ca mps 
were like?  You 
did 
know?
 
 
Answer: Yes,thePolesbroughtinso
me  news. They were not the best 
sour c e a
bout anything 
that was adversetotheJewish people. T hey tried 
to 
shove it down our throat.ﬁ They 

are ki lling them by the 
thousand, 
by the millions,ﬂ they said. We didn't  know 
whether we could believe it or not but it wa
s the truth. They told us about a camp 
that I was going to be shipped to. They
 are gassingthem bythe thousands every 
day. 
OnedayI noticed that Ihadtogothrougha square,whereall 
the 
people were going 
to beassi gnedtoacamp. T heydi dn't 
tell 
us we w e re going to a concentration 
camp.  The y just said we 
are 
going to a war camp.   I noticed there was 
information on 
th e 
bulletin board thatR___ (599)w a sgoingwith this 
transport 
today. Anyone who would liketo beassigned tothis same  
transport 
and be 
sure that  they can getthe 
same  luxuryashegets, 
let 
them enroll. The fact ofthe 
matterwas they didn't give him a
ny 
time at all. They puthim rightawayinto the gas 
chamber, himand hiswife.  Ioutlived him. Istayedthere Ithinkforanother 
tw o 
weeks.  Finally, they stopped giving us the rations.  They 
said, ﬁO
kay, you don't 
want to goto the transport, youwon't get 
any 
food. That was -- (End of   Side B,

Question:   And so? 
 
Answer: Ifeltthatsome onewaslooking 
atme and Iturned myheadand I 
saw 
a blondeyoung 
woma n with a littleboynext
 to her. Iwas sure, 
at 
first,that she must bea German.  
She didn't havea trace of 
Jew 
in her,blonde, blue eyes. She cametoward me and 
she said, 
th e  
first question, ﬁ A re you going with this transport? ﬂ I said 
yes. 
Then 
she introduced herself and said h e r  name  w a sLessman (

and this w a s h e r  little 
brother.ﬁThis guy is 
impulsive. 
Hedoesn't  listen and going toacampwhere his lifeis

a 
sudden, Iwas appointed a 
guardian of a little boy. 
 
Question:The boy's name ?  
 
Answer: Lessman, I can't  reme mber his first name.  I don't recall.  
She 
said, ﬁI'l l be 
eternallythankful ifyou could justma ke sure 
that 
he 's not running off, that he's not 
doing things that he 
shouldn't 
be doing.  I give permission to give him a kick in 
the 
pants if hedoes it.ﬂ  She said goodbyeand said she™s 
working 
for a tailoring factory.  
They'r e going to beanother three 
weeks 
in the ghetto and then itwill be liquidated. 
Theirs will 
be 
liquidatedtoo. (Two ghettos?) The boy and I arrived the following 
morning at a camp. The first thing I saw 
was a human body st retched over the barbed 
wires. One of his hands was spread out lik
e he was trying to c
onquer the wire gate. 
 
Question: Wherewasthis,whereareyou 
now?
 
 
Answer: InAuschwitz-Birkenau. 
On the frontof the campwasa

The  
following morningwecame outin
frontof the barrack.  It 
was 
a tent 
actually
–
 
 
Question: Isthatwhereyoustayedthenight 
before?
 
 
Answer:  Yeah. 
 
A tent, half-round tentandth
ere were people sleeping on 
the  
ground fromone 
side and the other side,ma ybe a hundred 
pe opl e 
in each tent. Wewere assigned 
toone ofthem and they 
star te d 
shouting ﬁ R ouse,rouse.ﬂ (52)tocome out,a 
selection.  They want 
to 
select who should liveandwho 
shoulddie. Theywere doing 
thejob of G-d. You learn fastwhen you are in a situation likethat. 
I 
noticed that the 
little boywas putontheleftside. We were 
told 
that the left  side is theside that goes 
straight intothe 
fr ying 
pan. I motion to him that he should crawl over to my 
side. 
He 
started moving and they hit him over the head but hedidn't 
give 
up. Whenthe 
SS ma n turned around,heran totheothersi de. 
Then 
later he said, ﬁ I toldyou to stay 
over there.ﬂ I  s a i d ,  ﬁ T hi s is 
my 
brother, Ican't lethimbewithoutme ,I™vegotto 
watch over 
hi m.ﬂ  
Okay, okay.Hehithimoverthe 
head, he hit me  over the head 
but 
he  le t us  s t a y.  I  t ol d  hi m a f te r 
that incident, ﬁWe™
ve  got  t o e nroll 
to go out to work, not to be in
 this camp beca
use any day, you 
escape today but you wo
n't escape tomorrow or  
the next day. I said 
we™ve got to go ou
t and work into a satellite campwhere 
th e y  
haven't 
got extermination.He said,ﬁOkayif 
I 
see some thing that's going on, I'llcome and 
let you know to 
go 
ove r there.ﬂ Hekept on look
ing all day and the following 
morning, 
when Iwasgoingtobetattooed,
 therewas alineand Inoticed 
a 
truck 
standing not farfromoverthere.
 
They were taking 
onl y 
people that hadthe tattoo 
soIwent overtothat truckdriver and 
I ask him if he needs some  people. He 
said ﬁ Y es, Ineed 
some 
people, carpenters,mechanics,
 all the peoplethat could 
repair stuff that goes wrong in some of those m i n e s  wher e you dig 
the  
coal.ﬂ
 
He said, ﬁWe have a big camp, a number of camps 
in 
that area andwe are all working 
for that mi ne. Ifyou 
can 
do thework thatyou clai
m you can,you canhave agood 
position 
there.ﬂ He told me  right afte
r Igetthetattoo, Icancome  
over. 
I started 
looking forthatLessma n boy, b u t  h e  w a s  nowhere tobe found.I
 
begged the   driver, ﬁCould you 
wait another half an hour?  He promised he 's  going to come  
here.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo way, i t ' s  
getting 
d a r k  a n d  I  h a v e  t o  b e  o n my way.ﬂ I got separated 
from hi m.  I went to a camp by the name  Fersengruber  (lO 4) and when I arrived, I 
found out that I had a cousin 
in that camp. and then a second cousin who was a kapo.  
I tried to look up my cousin 
and 
hisna me was Kott, DaveKott. (109)Helooked 
just terrible 
like 
he's  not going to last  a week, his cheeks sunken and he had 
a 
yellowish complexion.Isaid, ﬁWhat  are they doing to you? ﬂ He 
said, ﬁT
hey're 
killing me daybyday. 
 
I justcannot be inthat 
mine. 
It's  too much for me.ﬂ 
 
I 
promised himI 'llseewhatIcandoif 
I 
get assigned to one of 
those placesthatare 
going toma ke 
repairs 
for themi ne. I'llseema
ybe Icanpushyou ininto 
that. 
I 
also promised myself I'm going to seethat 
kapo. 
His name  
was 
Ya nek Koltz. 
(121).  
 
I didn't wait long. 
 
Isaw him marching 
down. 
I said, ﬁ Yanek.ﬂ 
 
He said, 
with hisarrogant expression and 
filthy 
language, hesaid,ﬁ Y ouso-and-so,what 

do you want from me ? ﬂ  I told him we are related and he said, ﬁ We are related?  
C o m e on over here, let 
me 
give you ahug.ﬂ
 
He lifted uphis foot
 andgave itto 
me, oh 
boy! 
Knocked me down cold on the ground.    He said, ﬁIf you ever come  
close 
to me , I'll finish the jobonyou. Norelatives, 
nothing. 
I
don't  know you, you don't 
know 
me.
 Just get lost.ﬂ So Iknew Ihad
 
to keep adistance from hi m. 
 
A day or 
two days later, they called myna mea
ndsaid Ishould come thisandthishour. 
They'r e going totake metoashop t h a t ™ s  not finished 
yet 
but we have to start 
working on 
it.
  We have some work to be 
done 
forthemi ne.Iwent over there and 
there was another fellow 
by 
the na me  Adash Karp (141)and hewas selected to 
be the 
foreman. 
Iintroduced mys e lf to him and he said,ﬁIfyou claim that you 
know 
all of that work that you sa
id you do,we are going tobe 
good 
friends. ﬁ
Hedidn't know toomuch butwhathedidn't know, he 
mad e 
up with his mouth. 
 
The 
first job was an elevator shaft that had to 
be 
repaired.  One of  the ge ars was 
strippedandweeither h a d  to 
buy 
another gear, which was not available 
because 
 
they quit 
making 
those. A ll ofthefactories were geared forproduction for 
the 
war. 
So,wehad to improvise and putintwogears, teeth we called 
it. 
We  had 
totake out those two thatwere stri pped and file them 
down 
and putintwoint h e i r  
place.  Since we didn't have a nything to 
weld 
it,we had todrill ahole into that gear 
and then set it up with so me  
screws 
soitwillwork forthetime  being.Then that 
other 
Karp came over and said, ﬁBoy-oh-boy.  You really 
surprised
 me. I don'™
  
 
 
know where you learned 
 
it  but whatever 
you
 
did, 
it 's terr ific.ﬂ  They put it 
up and itworked and 
 I
 didn't hear complaints for quite a while.       W e  could weld 
t o  itand repairing it was no problem.The shop took shape. E ach 
and
 every one had 
an assigned area that heworked from with the 
tools
 assigned to him. I  tried to 
get my cousin to come in and 
I
 talked to that ot her Karp. 
 
I 
said 
the guyis 
dying  
 by 
inc hes, couldn't 
you 
find 
s o me thing to do for him?  He said, ﬁIf Itake him 
in and he 
does n't 
know the basics, you arenot goingto
 behurt, I'mgoingto be hurt. 
I don't 
 
want to 
 
jeopardize my    life 
for 
s o me body Idon'tevenknow.ﬁ
  That was the 
end of 
that.
 
I 
worked inthereforanumberof 
mo n t h s .  
 
Oneday,afellow who worked 
across from me  was bulging. I said, ﬁW
hat 
haveyou gotin there? ﬂ He said,ﬁ I went to 
an Italian prisoner-of-warcamp whic h was adjoining and they gave me  some  

potatoes.ﬂ I  said, ﬁEmpty out everything a
nd put it in here in my workshop.ﬂ I thought 
that ma ybe I will be immune, but him, they would probably ki ll. Sure enough, a 

mi nute later the head kapo came in and sai
d, ﬁWhere is that Jew who just took some  
potatoes from the prison-of-war? ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁI don't know.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou don't know?  I 
can point him out to you. I have been watchi
ng him.ﬂ So he went to him a nd started 

kicking him and beating him, and asking wher
e are the potatoes?  He said, ﬁI haven't 
got them.ﬂ It was true, he didn't have them. He ha d him on the ground, kicking him 

me rcilessly. Finally, I went over to him and 
said he brought them over and he dumped 

them in my workshop. He said to come with
 him and he took me  to his place. It was a 
tiny booth and some body was holding my head. 
He kept on hitting my back with an 
electric cord. I felt the fi rst ten, but then I 
didn't feel any more. Either I was numb or--
he gave me  50 times in the back. He said, 
ﬁLet it be a lesson to you. Don't  help anyone 
out. If you want to be a good Sa ma ritan, 
you will wind up dead. The next Saturday, 
we went to take a shower and when I exposed
 my  back to the water, it's like a million 
pins kept on hurting me . All of a sudden, the SS me n, the lagerfuhrer came in. He 

noticed the bruised back. He came over 
and asked who did it to you. I said, ﬁNobody 
did it to me , I had an accident.  I fell a
nd that's  what happene
d.ﬂ He said, ﬁI can 
tell, this is not a fall, some one must have 
hit you.ﬂ I said no. If I would have told him 
the truth, he would have gotten off scot fr
ee. He would have done nothing because he 
was the head of the kapos and I would be pr
obably the one that could be dispensable. 
He could dispense with me  but he couldn't di
spense of him. So I figured I'll stick to 
the lie and I stuck to it. He said, ﬁWe
ll, have it your way.  And for all your 
information I want to tell you, I'm her e  to 
dish out justice.ﬂ Justice! He said, ﬁIf 
some one be ats you up like that, you come  to me
 and I'll see to it that it won't happen 
again.ﬂ Go to him, to an SS ma n and seek 
justice.  Well, that was in October, the 
month of Oc tober. During the night, we ha
d been hearing from 
a distance thunder-like 
sounds and we knew that the Russians were co
ming close.  We were told that they are 
going to liquidate the camp and we 'll have
 to relocate somewhere else but it di dn't 
happen until December. One night, they woke 
us up. We  couldn't even dress ourselves 
properly and we had to ma rch about 30 kilo
me ters. That wasn't  a ma rch, that was a 
jogging, we kept on running like someone woul
d be chasing us. We  came to a city by 
the name  Glivitz  (263) that was German
 territory and it was a railroad hub where 
all the trains kept on comi ng from Poland, 
from Germany, from Czechoslovakia,they 
all ca me  there.   On the way to Glivit
z, I noticed a guy where I was walking and 

mi nding my own business that he looked fa miliar. I went over to him and I asked, 

ﬁAre you Myron Mak?  (275). He looked at
 me  and said, ﬁOh my God, yes , I am 
Myron Mak  and you are Szpiro.ﬂ I said yes,
 I am. He looked like he's not going to 

last an hour. He was suffering from dyse
ntery. He couldn't keep anything inside 
him, it kept on running out from hi m.   I 
told him, ﬁ Lean against me  and I'll try 
to walk with you.ﬂ But he was much taller 
than I was and he slowed me  down because 
he hims elf couldn't walk fast. Finally, we 
came to the end of the line. There was an SS 
ma n by the name  of De browalski (289) and he
 claime d he was from Roma nia. He s a id 

to me , ﬁYou schwartza Juda (290), you black
 Jew; if you are not going to move up, I'll 
shoot you and him together because once you co
me close to me, I have an order to 

shoot.ﬂI tried to get Mak to cooperate, ﬁPle
ase let's walk a little faster.ﬂ But I couldn't 
carry him, that was impossible. Fi nally, it
 got to a point where the SS ma n with his 
gun came to me and to him and said, ﬁAll I ha
ve to do is pull the trigger and you'll be 
both dead. I'm giving you notice, move up.ﬂ Whe n Mak heard that, some thing came 

over him, he started running toward the 
SS ma n and the SS man started shooting at 
him. The SS ma n grabbed a hold of him and 
threw him into the ditch. He told me , You 
better get lost from here because I have 
an eye on you. You'll be next.ﬂ I heard his 
advice and I got up into the mi ddle of the 
line. I ran up close to my good friend, Moka 
K  (317) while I was (almost?) trampled
 on the trip from Glivitz to Prague, 
Czechoslovakia. He said, ﬁYou stay with me , 
wa lk the same  pace I'm walking and  if 
you get tired, I'll help you out.ﬂ Coming back to that Moka K, the way I got 

acquainted with him. He was a man of i m
me nse  power. He could take a bar, bend 
it and ma ke  a flower out ofit, a heavy ba
r, an iron bar. He entertained SS people by 
showing them what he can do. Some how, I c
ouldn't  believe it but they wanted to 
preserve him.  One day, one SS ma n came 
into our shop and said, ﬁYou know that 
Jew that bends the bar? We would like him 
to come  and work here.ﬂ So that other 
Karp said the only place that we are goi
ng to have available is when we get a 

blacksmith. If we get a blacksmith, he could work with the blacksmith and hit the iron 
while it's  still hot. It took us a few days and we ran across some body, a J e wish ma n 

who was a blacksmith from years ago from 
a city in Gloslavik (349) in Poland. He 
knew his trade and from that time on, the blacksmith and he got to be 

inseparable. I befriended him because when
 he didn't have much to do, he came over 
and talked to me  and we got to be very, ve
ry close. He impressed me ; I had never seen 
anyone that could do things like he did. Th
e guy took a bar between
 his teeth and two 
people on each side were hanging from the 
bar. Didn't bother him. Comi ng back to 
that -- I walked with him until we got to Gliv
itz and when we arri ved over ther e, they 
assigned us into open wagons. It was Decembe
r; it was very, very cold. We started 
out; they assigned, I think, a
bout 100 people to animal wa
gons, the owners shipped 
animals with it. When they put us in, there was no room to turn around. We were 

packed like sardines. A few hours later, we
 started to notice that people had been 
trampled because if someone couldn't breath
e properly, the mere fact that he was 
squeezed so tightly with others, robbed 
him of hi s breath.  People kept on falling 
down.  When a person fell down, the peopl
e kept on moving forward because the 
vacuum, they pushed one against the other. He was trampled, that person.  There was 

no way to help anyone because you couldn't go and move ten or 20 people from the 

area, to get to the bottom of that guy. 
Toward morning, we came  to Prague, 
Czechoslovakia. I said to my friend, M
oka K, ﬁYou know, how often will I be in 
Prague?  I'll take a look at what's  going on, 
how the other half are living. I couldn't 
believe it. There were hundreds of Czech
s near that area where the train stopped. 
They kept on encouraging us to jump off the train and they'r e going to help us. It was 

sheer nonsense because every wagon had two SS me n with machine guns on an 

elevation to watch that nobody jump s. They 
were even shooting at people who kept on 
throwing down a cup to catch some  snow because everyone was dehydrated. They 

were shooting at the people who tried to get 
a little snow.  I kept watching them but I 
said ﬁIt's a noble gest ure but it's not feasib
le. In my condition, I couldn't even run ten 
feet. How can I outdist ance a bullet?ﬂWhile 
I was thinking about it, I felt enormous 
desire to fall asleep. I felt
 I kept on sinking and sinking. All of a sudden, I felt that I'm 
being trampled. I felt that some one was wa
lking on my head, on my throat, on my 
body. I couldn't help my self; I figured well this
 is it. The next thing I knew I woke up 
and I was laying next to that Moka K. He 
made room for me to lay next to me. He 
pushed everybody from the whole-
-he threw them to get to the bottom, to get me  out. 
He knew where I was; I pointed out to hi
m when I came to the end of the wagon. I 
said, ﬁI'm going to be right hereﬂ and he
 knew exactly where.  When he saw people 
trampling on somebody, he kept on pushing th
em and throwing aside to pull me  out. 
When I came to, he said, ﬁYou're a sight
 to behold. G-d almi ghty, you are swollen, 
your head is twice the size and your face is one
 gr eat bi g bruise. Just stick close to me 
and I'll make sure that you'll get over it.
ﬂ We  we nt to a concentration camp by the 
name  Mauthausen. Our SS ma n, that lagerf
uhrer, the head of our camp, he was a 
shrewd fe llow. He knew if he gives up that 
position to be lage rfuhrer, he will have to 
go to the Russian front. He tried in the worst 
way to keep us intact. He tried to ma ke a 
deal with that Mauthausen la
gerfuhrer to take us in and 
give him a position there. That 
lagerfuhrer told him, ﬁMy advice to you is ta
ke them into the forest and shoot them. 
So he said ﬁNo, this I'm not going to do.ﬂ We
 started from ove r there and we went to a 

camp by the name  Rodhausen (481). Finall
y, he got what he 
wanted and that 
lagerfuhrer took us in and he tried to be very
 close to the group that he brought over.  
One day, he came to me and said ﬁThere is
 a position available.  They are ma king the 
V-1 rockets here. I know that you were ve
ry good over there. Would you like to try 

it? ﬂ  I said, ﬁIf you think I can do it, why not
? ﬂ  He  recommended me  to go and work 
with a German civilian. Every morning at si
x o'clock, that German civilian came  and 
picked me  up in his Volkswagen, a small, a temp lewagon (503) with three wheels. He 

picked me  up and took me  over into the mount
ains. They had thousands of feet of -- 

where they had been establishing an assemb
ly in the mountains.  They called it  
ﬁStchoneﬂ (513). I started to work over ther
e and the work was so diversified that 
nobody knew what others were working on. Each
 person had a different assignment so 
that nobody would know to give out the secr
et. I had one assignme nt; I did wheels, 
had to calibrate them and make sure that they were to one thousandth of a millimeter 

tolerance. That didn't last long because at
 that time , the Rus s ians kept on comi ng 
closer and the southern ar
my kept on moving up. They decided they were going to 
ship us to a different place. They packed 
us one morning on barges that normally carry 
grain. It's not meant for huma n occupancy. We
 were traveling a night and a day on the 

Elbe River. One morning, they opened the 
doors, I couldn't get used to it, I was 
blinded by the light -- I hadn't seen any 
daylight. When I looked around, I saw dead 

bodies. People who were just
 dropping dead from -- they suffocated. We  stopped at a 
city by the name  Liebeck (559). We  got out
, whoever was still alive. One of the SS 
me n said to the guy who was running the boa
t, ﬁAt least you are 
not going empty, you 
are going to have dead cargo on the way back. 
A cruel joke but--.  We  started walking 
from Liebeck until we came to an area S  (573). It surprised me, this was an 

intersection in the mi ddle of
 nowhere. There was one big building, a barn and a house. 
I asked what is going on?  One of the Ukrain
ian SS me n said ﬁThis is the house where 
Schmidt, our SS fuhrer lives with his parents.
 He put us up in the barn because it was 
getting dark already. It's  the only night 
I enjoyed a good night's sleep. I was sleeping 
with Moka K next to me. When I got up, I 
noticed a fellow who  looked like one of 
the Goldrans brothers from (603) and I sai
d, ﬁYurek, what's  the ma tter with you?  You 
don't look the same to me?ﬂ He said, ﬁI'm so sick, I don't think I'll make it another 

day.ﬂ He had dysentery. I said, ﬁCome on, 
get up because if you are not going to go 
and walk, they will shoot you in here.ﬂ  ﬁNo,ﬂ 
he said, ﬁI gi ve up. I had it. This is the 
end of my line.ﬂ Sure enough, a few mi nutes la
ter, they started shooting everyone that-

We walked seven kilometers to the North S
ea. It bothered me that I couldn't figure out 
what they want, are they going to push us 
into the sea?  One of the Ukrainian SS men 
said, ﬁYou need a little r
ecreation. You had a hard time, we are going to put you on a 
sea boat.ﬂ Then another one came and sa
id, ﬁWe are going to exchange you for 
German prisoners-of-war with the English.ﬂ
 Nobody knew what was going to happen. 
We saw three ships in the distance. The biggest  one we could see was the 
Capacorna
 
(14). Next to it from the right-hand side was the 
Athens
 and the one behindthe 

Capacorna 
we couldn't see the name because the 
Capacorna
 was the biggest and we  
couldn't see what kind of a ship it was. They
 took us and loaded us on those ships.  
They counted 100 people and we just -- I was 
separated at that poi
nt from that Moka 
K. I went to the 
Athens
, Moka K went to the 
Capacorna
. We were ma ybe 350 people 
in that ship, on the lowest deck. It was fa
r from luxury. We were fed a very poor diet, 
you couldn't even, it was mostly water. We  had be en smelling the food that they had 

been ma king in their kitchen, the fresh br
ead and everything. That was only for them. 
The following morning, we heard airplanes 
flying over our ship and coming very 
close to it. The captain of the ship de
cided quickly. He said, ﬁYou guys from down 
below, whoever speaks German, come  on up he
re to the upper deck.ﬂ I went up and a 
number of other guys went up. We were w
earing those striped uniforms. He said, 
ﬁDuring the day, you have to be on the top deck. When the planes go by, they will se e 

that there are no soldiers on the deck and 
they won't bomb it.ﬂ He was smart. The 
Capacorna
 was not as smart and the next morning, when the English came , they 

started bombing the 
Capacorna
 and we could see from a distance, the ship was 
engulfed in fire. I don't know what happene
d to Moka K -- either he succumbed in 
there--.  I had also a frie
nd that I knew from the camp by the name Blockman (51). 

He came out  with scars all over his back fr
om the  fire. He saved himself by jumping 
into the salt water, which scarred him for lif
e. It didn't take long, a day at most, when 
we came up to the upper deck, we didn't  
see an SS ma n. I started looking around to 
ma ke an excuse (? ) and there was nobody in 
sight. I went into 
the kitchen and there 
was fresh bread being baked. Like a fool, 
I grabbed a piece of half-baked bread, hot, 
and I stuffed it. I got very sick, it didn't
 agree with me . But the English came on the 
boat and they said in German and Polish 
and English, ﬁBe patient, we are going to 
bring boats and load you all up and take 
you off.ﬂ That took them maybe an hour, at 
the most two hours. They came with larg
e boats and took us down. They were not 
organized because they were not prepared 
for what they saw. There were hundreds of 
people shabbily dressed in t
hose uniforms. They said, ﬁFra
nkly, we are not prepared 
for what we saw. We  give you authority to 
go into any house (where? )
 that is deserted. 
If nobody's t here, take it over. We 'll suppor
t you, if someone comes and claims it, you 
just tell them to go to the authority.ﬂ I just
 didn't believe that this can be true. I didn't 
want to go to a house that ma ybe some  
SS ma n was occupying. I went to a barracks 
and I found a quiet corner and I went to 
sleep. It was a barracks for ma rines and I 
found a uniform, a ma rine uniform. I put it on 
just to get off from that striped cloth. 
The next mo rning, I went out and I star
t to look around to see what is going on.  
I me t a fellow by the name  K (89) who was 
ma rried to a girl from our city. He was 
wearing a practically new suit.
 I said, ﬁ Where did you get th
at suit? ﬂ He said, ﬁI found 
it in the house I occupied.ﬂ The suit didn't f
it him. He was a  tailor and I saw he had 
improvised -- shortened it and cut it down
 in width but it was still a fa irly new 
garment. He said, ﬁIf you want, you can come
 and occupy the place with me .ﬂ I just 
couldn't take it. I was still afraid that 
any mi nute the Germans were going to overrun 
the place and take us back. I went into the city and I met some civilians that the 

English brought over to take
 over, to ma ke a camp for 
all the people that were 
liberated. He  said, ﬁThese barracks here 
are going to be designated for all of you, 
where you are going to be  put up. We 'll try in 
the future to find out if any of you will 
be able to emigrate to different countries. In the meanti me , the UNRRA which was 

our body of the world organization, the Un
ited Nations, will be helping you out, 
you're going to get food. Any one of you w
ho is undernourished will go to a hospital 
and we'll build you up.ﬂ It started to look 
like it would be a long-range project and I 
started to feel a little better. After a 
fe w months, I ran across a guy who came from 
Italy. I talked to him and asked him about a c
ousin of mi ne. He said, ﬁI did run across 
your cousin.ﬂ He was from a neighboring town
 and he knew him. He said, ﬁI saw him 
in Bari, where there was an Israeli legion. 
He was there with th
e Israeli legion.ﬂ I 
decided that I was going to l
ook for him. A day or two days later, I was hitchhiking on 
the trains going down south until I came to 
Austria. From Austria, there were no 
trains going to the Alps and we had to 
go mountain-climbing to go across the border. 
I came to Rome and then from over there I hi
t c he d a  r i de  t o  Ba r i , 
only to find out that 
he had been there and he left a short time  ear
lier. They told me most likely he went to 
Ts (139), which was another side of the pe
ninsula. That was an area where Jewish 
people were training future sa
ilors. Was Palestine but th
ey had long-range plans and 
Ts  was the place where future sailors were 
trained over there. He wanted to go to 
Israel and when I came to Ts, they told me  that yes, the guy was there. They said he 
wanted to go to Israel but ﬁwe cannot sh
ip anyone to Israel. We ourselves have 
problems if we want to go back because th
e English are blockading the whole sea over 
there, the Mediterranean Sea. They won't 
let any boats go to Israel.ﬂ I decided to go 
back to Germany and I wound up in a camp 
Ber gen-Belsen. Most of the liberated 
people from that area were situated there. 
I ran across some  friends I knew from ca mp.  
We four boys occupied a one-room apartment.
 We started ma king plans about what to 
do with our lives. One fellow by the name  Al
ex Epstein (161) befriended a nice young 
lady, Sophia Levy. He got ma rried over there.
 Blockman, I mentioned him before, had 
a friend in Sweden. The friend had been sent 
to Sweden because she was very sick and 
was taken there to be built up. Blockman decided he wanted to go to Sweden to ma rry 

her. I was left with one other guy --Fogel, K
ubat Fogel. We decided 
at that point that 
since he wanted to go to Australia and I wa
nted to go to the United States and they 
didn't have a consulate over in Bergen-Belse
n, so I'd have to move to Munich, where 
there was a consulate. About two weeks late
r, I found mys e lf in Munich. I started to 
look around where ma ny Jewish people c
ongregated. There was a cafe by the name  
Grunwald and I started asking if they had s
een my cousin. They said, ﬁAs a ma tter of 

fact, he was here a little wh
ile ago. If you stay here long 
enough or return tomorrow, 
you'll find him, for sure.ﬂ Sure enough, 
I ran across him the following day. We  
decided to move to a smaller community a
nd it was about 10 kilome ters from Munich. 
I me ntioned (188) and we  took a nice apar
tment and we lived in there for ma ybe 
seven, eight months. During that time, my c
ousin found out that he has a brother in 
Engleberg, Sweden. He had been sent to Sweden because the Swedes took in people 

who were undernourished or were too young 
to be on their own. The brother was a 
youngster so Sweden took him in and sent hi
m to a little camp, a school established to 

teach young people. Whe n we found out, we wa
nted in the worst way to go and visit 
him. But we couldn't get a permit to cross th
e border, so we notified him that we were 
going to be at the border crossing. He  came to see us. We  spe nt a day with him. He 
had to go back to be in the school. About four
 or five months later, he got a permit to 
go to the United States. My unc
le that lived in Ne w York, and he worked out some  
papers to bring him over. In between time,
 when he left, I went by train back to 

Bergen-Belse n ma inly to do a little business 
because we lived privately and we were
not supported by the UNRRA. We 
had to support ourselves.   
 

I got very sick one night and I had excr
uciating pain. Kubat Fogel said, ﬁYou know 
that the only thing -- the best thing I can suggest is to take
 you to the hospital.ﬂ I went 
to the hospital, I was limping I didn't know 
what happened to me . They di agnosed that 
I have sciatica. They treated me  like a 
guinea pig. They kept on shooting me  with 
novocaine and more novocaine but I didn't f
eel any relief. For a few mi nutes, while 
the novocaine was working, I was all right, but
 then the pain started to come  back. 
While I was in the hospi tal, I got a message 
that my cousin was killed in an accident  
in Munich. He was hitchhiking a ride from 
M -- (230) to Munich. The truck that he 
hitchhiked on tried to cross train tracks
 ahead of an oncoming train. There was no 
barricade to stop him. The train hit the tr
uck and killed him in
stantly. They wouldn't 
release me but I told the doctor I'm willing 
to pay a nurse to go with me  to Munich. 
I said I would like to be at
 the funeral. They assigned 
a nurse and I took a train and I 
went to Munich only to find 
out that I mi ssed the funera
l by six hours. Wh en I went 
back to our apartment, I couldn't believe 
my eyes. Some one had pilfered the whole 
place. I didn't  even have a pair of shor ts
 to change into. I 
asked the landlady, ﬁ Who

did this?ﬂ She said the Yiddisha Gemi nda
, the Jewish people assigned.  They 
organized a group of Jewish people and they 
ma de them (do it?), one said he is a 
rabbi. The other said he is going to be th
e president, they appointed themselves!  
When they found out my  cousin had been 
killed, they came over and they said ﬁWe 
are taking possession of everythi
ng.  We are going to give it back to them when they 
come.ﬂ She said that the Szpi
ro was going to come  and he had to have the stuff. He 

said they can come  to us and we'll give it 
to him. Only to find out that nobody claime d 
that they had it. They hid it -- each on
e took something and I had to go out and buy 
everything from top to bottom to get dresse
d. I didn't have anything to change into. 

In the meantime, I had to have that nurse because every few hours, she had to give me  

novocaine. I begged her to stay with me
 a little while longer so I could have 
some thing to change into.  

 

The second day, I checked into the Munich 
Nerve Clinic. They considered that a 
nerve disease, some thing to do with the 
nervous system, was causing the pain. They 
started treating me  in an entirely di ff er
ent ma nner than I was treated before. I was 

there six mo nths and I didn't ma ke any progr
ess. The doctor that was assigned to me  
said the only thing he could suggest was 
Badhaden (282), Baden-Ba
den?  which treats 
people who have rheuma tism, arthritis and al
so sciatica.  Mud baths could help.  I 
went there and they gave me  th
at treatments and I started to feel better every day, to a 
point that I didn't limp a ny more. After three 
months, I was able to get discharged and 
go back to Munich.  When I went back 
to Munich, I found out that I had papers 
already to go to the United States.  Six 
weeks later, I was already on my way to 
Bremerhaven, where I boarded a ship and I we
nt to the United States.  My uncle and 
my cousin came  to greet me .  I stayed with my uncle for about three months. After 

that, I decided that I was sick
 and tired of New York. It di
d not impress me too muc h.   
In the morning at six o'clock, I had to be on 
the subway in order to ma ke it to work 
that st arted eight o'clock.  I didn't get home
 until about six o'clock.  I could barely eat 

the food and I had to go to school. It was a pace 
that I just couldn't take it.  I started to 
look around and see if I could se
ttle some place that is not so hectic. I found a friend 

who lived in St. Paul and I contacted him.  
He told me  you come , be my guest.  If you 
like it, you can stay.  If you don't like it,
 you can always go back.  I took him up on 
that. I came on a We dnesday, and on a Thursday, I already had a job. They hired me  

to work for Burt's Shoe Stores.  I was with
 them over a year.  In the meantime, I met 
my wife and we got ma rried in 1952, 
August 24, 1952.  Soon, we™ll have our 40
th
 
wedding anniversary.
