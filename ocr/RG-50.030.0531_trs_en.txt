Question: Œ and interview with Mr. 
Tracy Strong , Jr
., conducted by 
Peggy 
Frankston
 of the 
United Sta tes
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
, for the 
Rivesaltes 
Internment Camp  Memo rial Museum on July  Œ on June 11
th
, 2009, in 
Washington
, 
D.C.
 Thank you for coming today Mr. 
Strong
. 
Answer: You™re welcome. 
Q: Could you in troduce yo
urself and tell us a little about yourself please? 
A: Okay. I™m tra Œ 
Tracy Strong
, born in 
Seattle
,
 Washington
, September 4
th
, 
1915, and grew up th ere. My father had moved to 
Seattle
 in 1910 to
 join the 
Seattle 
YMCA 
as a Boys™ Worker. So we spent the first 12 years at Œ in 
Seattle
 on
 Queen 
Anne Hill
. Eventually moved up 
on the boulevard in 
Queen Anne Hill
 and built a 
house looking out over Lake 
Union
. My bra Œ I have a older brother 
Robbins
, and a 
younger sister 
Ruth
, and we enjoyed a very  pleasan
t gro Œ time at growing up in 
Seattle
; it wasn™t quite as crowded as it is 
now. The house we built is Œ in fact, I 
just heard from the lady who lives there, sh
e bought it from my father in 1923, and 
has lived in it ever since. So the hou
se remained the same. We had a normal 
childhood, my father 
was always off to a 
YMCA
 camp. And summers we™d join 
him in the camp, so we sp
ent a very pleasant time in 
Seattle
. Then in 1923 my

father was appointed to the Boys
™ Work secretary for the world™s 
YMCA 
in 
Geneva
, 
Switzerland
, so the family all packed up. 
I was five, my sister was se ven 
or eight, and my  brother was 10 or 11. And 
my  father indicated that if we™re going 
to work in a world™s 
organization, he should
 see something of the 
Orient
. So we 
sailed out of 
Seattle
 in November 1923 on
 the Œ one of the princess ships, and went, 
actually, practically all the way around the 
wo rld in six months. As I think back on 
that, mu st Œ and have traveled with my
 own children, here were three young 
children and my  mo ther taking care of us 
all the way around the world. We went 
first to 
Japan
, and got there just after the big earthquake in 
Japan
 in 1923. Then 
M-Moncton
(ph), 
Manchuria
, 
China
,
 Ho ng  Kong
. Then arou
nd through 
India
, up 
through the 
Suez Canal
, went over to 
Palestine
, and eventually to 
Venice
, an-and 
arrived in 
Geneva 
in April 1924. Which was quite
 a trip. So we settled into 
Geneva
, which was then a much smaller town
 that it is now, but also a very 
international town, b
ecause a lot of international orga
nizations were there, including 
the international Red Cross, and then ma
ny of the other youth-
serving or people-
serving organizations.  
Q: Where did you go to school? 
A: Oh, we started out in the 
public school, across the street 
[indecipherable] 
wh ere 
we had to learn French in a hurry if we
 wanted to play . We children picked  up

French very  quickly, my  folks never did,
 so we asked them not to speak Fren ch  
when we were, cause their accent was so p
oor. Anyway, they went
 there, went to 
international school for a year or so, and ev
entually came  back to this country  for 
two ye Œ my  father thought I should learn En
glish, so I came back
 for two years to a 
high school in 
Bainbrid ge Islands
,
 Washington
, and finished high school there. 
Then I was 16, at which time I felt I was 
a little too young for college, and as he and 
my mother were traveling a gr
eat deal for the y Œ world™s 
YMCA
, I went to school 
in 
Germany
, 
Deutsche Jugend Œ Jugend hof
, which was 1932. And if you 
remember your history well, that was the time that 
Hitler
 came to power, in 1933. 
So I went through th at whole time of th
e change in regime and cha Œ and heard 
Hitler
 speak twice, big rallies. And then at
 the end of the year, went back to 
Ohio
 Œ 
Oberlin
 College, 
Ohio
, wh ere I spent four years and got my  bachelor™s degree, 
1937. At that time I w asn™t quite sure what
 I wanted to do, a ch
ance of wo rking in 
the 
YMCA
, or in the church. So I went to 
Yale Divinity School
 for three years in 
New Haven
, 
Connecticut
. In 19 grad Œ got my  da Œ my  
master™s degree indivinity 
and it was in 1940, first war had already started in 
Europe
, and my  father had 
headed  up the war Œ war prisoner™s aid of the 
YMCA
, which was approved in the 
Geneva 
Convention, that international Red 
Cross took care of the physical 
problems of the prisoners on ev-every country, and the 
YMCA
 took care of their

spiritual and intellectual problems, physical problems. So, my father was the head 
of this organization, but 
he Œ with headquarters in 
Geneva
, although Œ and 
Geneva
 
was still open then. 1940, of course, the Œ 
France 
fell. In just a few weeks, 
blitzkrieg 
[indeciphera ble]
 Germans. I did Œ 
Q: When  did Œ did you go back to 
Germany
? 
A: I went back to Œ actua
lly to ge Œ headed for 
Geneva
. Had to take a boat from 
New York
 to 
Lisbon
, then across 
Spain
 where we got Œ just at the time 
France 
had 
fallen, so everything was closed down , so we were stuck in 
Barcelona
 for several 
weeks. And then even
tually the group went across southern 
France
 and up th e 
Rhone Valley
 to 
Geneva
. And went originally to work
 with the European Student 
Relief fund, which was an organization 
made up of the three student serving 
organizations. The World Student Chris
tian Federation, the Protestants. The 
Pax 
Romana
, the Catholics, 
NISS
, a neutral organization. And our job was to do for stu 
Œ university students what the 
YMCA
 was doing fo r the general population. So we 
singled out students in camp s in
 every country. I did go to  
Germany
 for about six 
months, to work  in the prisoner of war ca
mp , and visited Stalag 16, I think it was, 
and 17, one section of 
Germany
. The ma Œ most of the prisoners were either 
French or British, Polish. 
A few ru Œ quite a few Russi
ans eventually, which now

because 
Russia
 did not sign the 
Geneva  
Co nvention, we coul
d not get into the 
camps to visit them. 
Q: What were some of your activities in
 the camps with the prisoners of war? 
A: Mainly with the 
YMCA 
and the Œ and the European Student Relief Fund, the 
ESRF
, it™s called, for them I was ju Œ iden tify students, and try and get books, 
material to them, so 
they continue their studies. See,
 in the camps, particularly the 
officers™ camps, the officers were not a
llowed to work . They had nothing to do 
except organize activities. So the 
YMCA
 brought in books,
 sporting material, 
violins, anything to keep  them occupied  
during their imprisonmen
t. So I™d go the Œ 
there were about, I suppose,
 15 camps that I visited o
ff and on in the fall of 1941. 
Eventually Œ course, 
America 
wasn™t in the war yet, but 
in 1941 I went back to 
Geneva
. The Germans would not let me go in 
the camps any more, they thought I 
had helped  a prisoner escape, which was th
e last thing in the world I would have 
done. So  the Germans went and 
closed the camp
s to me. So Œ 
Q: So you went back  to 
Geneva
. 
A: So I went back to 
Geneva
. 
[interruption] 
So I went in the Œ mu st have been 
about March I left 
Germany
, went to 
Geneva
, where headquarters were for the 
ASRF
, and Œ and by this time there were camps set up in southern 
France
. See, 
when  the Germans took 
France
, everybody in northern 
France 
went to the south,

to get away the rapid advance. The Germ
ans kind ofoverran 
everybody, but then, 
as you recall, it divided 
France 
into occupied and unoccupied 
France
, with the 
occupied being headquarters in 
Marseilles
 and 
Vichy
. The 
Vichy
 government was 
set up in Œ in  
Vichy
 under General 
Pétain
, 
Laval,
 wh ich put the Germans very 
much in control. But at leas
t they didn™t Œ were not inte
rfering in southern Œ in  oro Œ 
unoccupied 
France
. 
Q: Tell me, who sent you to  
France
? Did 
Donald Lowrie
? 
A: No, 
Donald Lowrie
 was the head of the 
YMCA
 organization in southern  
France
. 
Q: He was based where? 
A: He was based in 
Marseilles [indecipherable]
 and Œ and the Œ our Œ our student 
organization wo rked  with the 
YMCA
, or under the 
YMCA
 because they had access 
to the camps. 
Q: So did he ask you do come from 
Geneva
 to Œ 
A: Well, it wasn™t so much 
his asking, he Œ he was in 
France
, and we were Œ and 
the Œ my  or Œ organization, the European
 Student Relief Fund wanted somebody to 
coordinate things for students only, in southern 
France
, so I Œ and the entry was 
through the 
YMCA
. So  I went, being sent by the 
European Student Relief Fund, be 
working with the 
YMCA
.

Q: You s Œ mentioned traveling with 
Everett Melby
, was he part of the European 
Student Relief Fund too? 
A: Yes, he was one of the secretaries. 
Q: Who was person who decided what 
your mission was? Was ther e someone 
above you? 
A: Yes, there is. 
A-André de Bionay 
was the head of the organization, was hired 
by th e three religious groups, or student grou
ps that had formed the organization. So  
I was responsible to him, but my activities w e
re pretty much up to me, what I could 
do with Œ to help students in southern
 France
. 
Q: Who funded you? 
A: The European  Student Relief Fund. 
Q: Because you seem to have a lot of
 tra Œ you seemed to travel a lot. 
A: I did. That was part of my  job, to  tr
avel from camp to camp
 and help set up the 
[indecipherable] 
or the 
bibliothèques
, in the various camps. 
Q: And your specific mission was intellect
ual support, and something else too? 
A: Spiritual, phy Œ whatever physical s
upport we could give. 
You know, I™m sure 
mainly, my main job was to identify students 
and see what we could do to either get 
them out of the camps, or to get them mate
rial to study with. Wasn™t too happy with 
students staying in the camps, cause c
onditions were hardly conducive towards

intellectual study. Andthere 
were all students that either started on a career in their 
home country, whether it was 
Poland
 or 
Germ any
, 
Romania
,
 Lith uania
. 
Q: Did you become friendl
y with some of them? 
A: Oh, very much so, and Œ 
Q: Can  y ou reme mb er so
me of their names? 
A: Well, the one I remember the best wa-was 
Hans Solomon
, who Œ we stayed 
friends, so I still co
rrespond with him. 
Edgar
 
Druenhoot
(ph), 
Ha n s May e r
(ph). 
Q: 
Palos
(ph)? 
A: 
Palos
(ph), and Œ 
Q: And what about some of the artists? 
You mentioned providing equipment for the 
artists. 

A: Right. 

Q: Do you remember so
me of their names? 

A: I don™t remember any of their names, but
 I still have one or
 two paintings that 
they did. 

Q: Did you purchase them? 

A: We purchased them in a way that Œ or 
they were donated. 
So Œ and we set up 
exhibitions for them so
 they could be sold.

Q: And what about some of the other artis
tic activities, they pl
ay Œ did they  play  
mu sical in s t ru men t s? 
A: Yes, well, we were able to provide vio
lins, cellos, guitars. Usually had a piano in  
the camp. So they would set up small mu
sical groups, depending on the activities, 
and depending on the in
terest, depending on the health
, because the condition in the 
camps weren™t really conducive to any intellectual work. 

Q: You mentioned the Russian choir in y
our diary? Do  you rememb er meeting a 
group of Russians? 

A: I remember very vaguely that a gro
up of Ru ssians Œ they were mainly though 
Russians who™d left 
Russia
 during the revolution. So 
they were what you call the 
white Russians, who had settled in 
Paris
, with a large colony of them in 
Paris
, and 
with the rest of the French
 they  left the north and came south. So  my  wo rk was 
primarily centered in 
Marseilles
, I lived at the Hotel 
Terminus
, and then we™d 
travel regularly to different camps. 
Q: You mentioned traveling with 
Donald  Lowrie
, can you talk a little about 
Lowrie
? He sounded as if he we
re an interesting person. 
A: Very interesting, very active, 
one of these what do you call it? 
A
-type persons. 
Very outgoing, charming wife, 
who did all the driving fo r 
Do na ld
. And 
Do na ld 
had 
work ed in  
Czechoslovakia
 with the Czec
hs, the Czech 
YMCA
, and

[indecipherable]
 Czech, and so  had a very  special place in his heart for the Czechs. 
Any Czech student came by, 
always got some help. But 
Do n
 was also the head of 
what they called the 
Nîmes 
committee, which was a committee of all the various 
private organizations: the Red 
Cross; Unitarian; Quakers; 
OSE
, Jewish 
organization. And th ey met once a month in 
Nîmes
, so it became known as the 
Nîmes
 committee, to coordinate their effo
rts, and then to intervene. And 
Do n
 would 
go to 
Vichy
 to talk to the representa
tives of the government in 
Vichy 
ab ou t 
permission to do certain things. 
Q: For example? 

A: Well, one thing th at happened  was be ab
le to get the refugees out of the camps, 
if they could support 
themselves, so that 
Vichy
 government did finally approve that. 
Whereas if an organization would provide fo
r them so the state didn™t pay anything, 
they could get them out of the camp s, or
 a prisoner of private means could get out 

of the camps.  
Q: Do you reme mb er going to  
Vichy 
with  him? 
A: I didn™t go to 
Vichy
, I went to 
Nîmes
 regularly, to the 
Nîmes 
co mmit t ee.  
Q: Did you actively participate in the 
Nîmes
 committee? 
A: Yes, I was representing the student relie
f fund and Œ but the c-committee wa Œ it 
was a very 
[indecipherable]
 very worthwhile, very in teresting committee, because

people of various interests Œ the Red Cro
ss, of course, was mainly interested in 
providing fo od, and the Swiss Red Cross par
ticularly, took care of a lot of children, 
whereas some of the other organizations were
 providing just inte
llectual or spiritual 
help. 
Q: Do you reme mb er some of the people
 from the Jewish organizations? Did you 
reme mb er 
Raoul Œ Ra ymond-Ra oul La mbert
? 
A: No, I can™t say that I do remember th
em. I met them all, of course, and knew 
them, but that™s a long time ago. 

Q: At one point you mention that the 
Vichy
 govern ment creates a Œ an official state 
organization for all Jewish organizations, 
Ugeef
(ph), 
u-g-i-f
. And Œ and you 
mention in your diary that 
Raymond-Raoul Lambert
 was supposed to be the 
general secretary and he refused. Do
 you have any reco
llection of that? 
A: Not really in any detail. 

Q: And you also speak
 about meeting Dr. 
Markeen
(ph) on a Œ on a train. He was a 
docto r wh o with 
OSE
. Do you rememb er him?  
A: A Swiss doctor, I think. I just by chan
ce met him because I travel a good deal, 
and meet a lot of people.  
Q: And do you remember some of
 the memor able sessio n s of the 
Nîmes
 
committee? Were there certain ti
mes when it became animated? 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
14
A: Oh, it always was animated, because ev
erybody there was an intellectual when Œ 
very di-different interests, but they all 
[indecipherable]
 in their own interests, and Œ 
but willing to cooperate. I rememb
er especially one session where 
Lowrie
 asked for 
a criticism of the committee, 
or recommendation, what we could do to improve, and 
it was very open, everybody put in their 
two cents worth, but
 very Œ very open 
discussion. Praise for 
Lowrie 
as president, because his 
was a difficult job to  bring 
them together, and get them to work
 together and go in one voice to 
Vichy
. 
Vichy  
was not too cooperative. I think 
Vichy
 was not thought of very
 much by the French 
themselves. They knew it was under the control of the Germans, that 
Pétain
, 
La va l
 
had very little of independence.
 
Q: You worked with  other organizations like the 
Cimade
, and Œ 
A: Met 
[indecipherable]
 
Cimade
. 
Q: Right. Can you tell me a little bit about the 
Cimade
? 
A: Well, the 
Cimade 
was set up by th e French, what they call a fede Œ 
Fédéra tion 
des étudiants
, a Protestant organization under 
Marc Boegner
, who was head of the 
Protestant church  in 
France
, which is, of course, very 
much a minority in f Œ in 
France
. And 
Cimade
 
[speaks French]
. 
Q: And who was Œ 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
15
A: And Mada Œ Madame 
Baro
(ph), a very active lady who Œ sh e was probably in 
her 30s and was the head of it 
[indecipherable] Vesfal
(ph),
 Duma s
, some of the 
names of people. And they would put 
students into the camps to set up a 
foyer
 with 
the 
YMCA
 and with  the European  Studen t Relie
f Fund. So they  had it in mo st of 
the camps, not all of them, but 
Gurs
 and 
Rivesaltes
, 
Les Milles
,
 
 
they had students living in the camp s, running th e 
foyer 
and organizing various 
activities fo r the internees. 
Q: Who is the person who was living in 
Rivesaltes
? 
A: 
Andre Dumas
 was one, Madame 
[indecipherable]
 was another. And th ey 
changed from 
time to time. 
Q: What about Œ w
ho was Mademo iselle 
Ugand
(ph), and Mademo iselle 
Sen
(ph)? 
Were they in with the 
Cimade
, or were they with another organization? 
A: I think they were with Swiss Red Cr
oss, wh ich was a big or-org anization. 
Q: At one point you ta
lk about traveling with
 Lowrie
 and getting a l Œ a lot done, 
and you reflect on the fact that you seem 
to get mo re done in a week  with Mr. 
Lowrie
 than the five months that
 preceded. And why was that? 
A: Well, he Œ well, he was a very ac
tive person, and had connections all over 
southern
 France
, and had lived  in 
France
, of course, before, so he knew the 
French. He was able to get the 
functionaires
(ph) to  listen to him and do wh at he 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
16
wanted. But he had that knack
 of approachin g them and not Œ not challenging them 
really, but getting them to listen to him, an
d then he never asked fo r mo re than he 
thought he could get, in 
getting permissions from the ca
mps. And he couldn™t do 
anything really to change the camp s, but 
he could call to atten
tion any discrepancies 
or any errors, or anything th at were happ
ening in the camp s. And he had a very  
persuasive approach to the pe
ople, and very friendly always. 
Q: I noticed that you had all sort
s of authorization forms, travel, 
lai sser-passer
, you 
had Œ had driver™s licen
se, you had all sorts of identity cards, and Œ 
A: Also had all kind of food cards
. See, ev-everything was rationed. 

Q: Who ga Œ who issued  your food cards? 
A: Who would what? 
Q: Who gave them to you, was it Œ 

A: The government. Everybody in 
France
 had to have coupons for bread, or for 
meat. For instance, we got, I think enough
 meat for a month to make one good 
hamburger. So, was very little meat. 
There™s a big difference between 
Germany
 
and 
France
, and of co urse 
Germany
 was taking all the fo
od, except the fruits.
 
France 
was a very rich agricultural country , of 
course, especially in the south, a lot 
of fruits and vegetables, so 
we survived pr
etty much on 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ 
[indecipherable]
 and asparagus. But you had to have
 coupons for those. As I recall

one Œ one of the wives who 
[indecipherable]
 committee, Madame 
Lagalle
(ph) 
went to spend four hours at the ma rket, and just got one 
[indecipherable]
 wh ich  
was not a great deal, but it was better than no
thing. So the Œ it seemed that food was 
very much the central part 
of our lives. And we were 
much better off, of course, 
than those in the camps who were getting 
very little food. But y
ou could always eat 
well and Œ depending what part of 
France 
you were in. When I went to 
[indecipherable]
 wh ich is another story, and there there was plenty of food. 
Q: Or when you went back to 
Switzerland
. 
A: And I Œ and I went back to 
Switze rland
 regularly. I would gain  Œ go back to 
Switzerland
, gain five pounds and lose it the next time I went to 
France
. 
Q: You also worked 
with the Quakers. 
A: Yes, 
Ross McClellan
. 
Q: Tell me about 
Ross McClellan
, a little. 
A: Very pleasant person, very
 outgoing. Both he and his 
wife were very dedicated 
people, good Qu akers. A big Œ big fella, he
 was very imposing, which helped  him a 
great deal. 

Q: You speak in the beginning of your diar
y in the year 1941 about your arrival, 
and a couple days after your arrival in 
Marseilles
, you witnessed something that the 
Quak ers were doing, and it was food distribution.

A: Oh, I think th ere was food th at was be
ing brought in by a ship , and th e Qu akers 
were distributing it. Mainly milk and flour. 
Q: How Œ how did th at work ?  
A: As long as food Œ the ships came in, 
it worked very well, 
but then the Germans 
stopped it. There weren™t any mo re food being sent in from abroad , so Œ 
Q: Who was entitled to the Œ 
the food they
 brought? 
A: Any children. It was mainly a-an attemp
t to improve the diet
 of the children in 
France
, not just refugees, but all Œ all child
rens. So distributio
n was throughout all 
of southern
 France
. 
Q: I remember you talking about setting up the 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Rivesaltes
, and 
apparently there was a theater th
ere, and you mentioned about Œ 
A: Well Œ well, we had built a Œ in the 
foyer
, one end of the 
foyer
, a stage, which 
became the theater, and Œ 

Q: And did you put on shows there? 
A: Put on sh ows, plays, or mu si
cal events. Held church there. 
Q: Did you go for services regularly, at Œ 
A: On Sundays, yes. Were 
very in teresting groups, caus
e there™d be maybe six or 
seven Germans, I mean, five or six Span ish, 
a couple of Poles. Three or four French 
people. So it™s conducted either
 in German or Œ or French.

Q: Did you preach? 
A: Once in awhile. 

Q: In wh at language? 
A: In French.  
Q: How did that go? 

A: Oh, it depends on the Sunday. Went o
ff pretty well, because half the people 
could understand French, most of them 
could understand a little French, but the 
audience was very mixed. So preaching or ta
lking to them is Œ any distraction wa Œ 
and anything di-d ifferent that was 
going on was Œ I mean, in a Œ not only 

interrupted the service, but I remember one
 time when I was preaching, I don™t have 
no id ea what it was on, and this Sp anish la
dy down in  the front had her baby with 
her. About halfway th rough she began to nu
rse him, which for a young, 25 year old 
was Œ it was surprise.  

Q: It distracted you. 
A: Some distraction, yeah. 
Q: You also mentioned Bible study groups. 

A: Right. The 
Cimade
 was very big on Bible studies. It was very much a 
intellectual approach to the 
Bible. And of co urse, everybody was invited to come, 
not Œ not just the refugees, but any other 
French people who we
re there. That was

one way of keeping the organi
zation central in their beliefs and in their ideas, and a 
ch-chance for exchange it 
as personal ideas, too.  
Q: You mentioned the fact that the French 
seemed very Œ their priorities seemed  to 
be evangelization and theoretical Protesta
ntism and ideas, whereas you wanted to 
do so cial work. Could you elab
orate on that a little, please? 
A: Oh, I think the difference between our tw
o cultures, I mean th
e Œ the church  in 
the 
United States
 is a Œ at least th e mainline church
es have always had a very  social 
gospel impact, where they felt that more than  just religious idea s, but they should 
also do something for people. Wh ether it wa
s healthcare, or whether improve foods, 
or take care of people in prisons, whereas
 the French were much more intellectual 
in their approach, and Œ and th
e French loved to discuss, 
and to talk, a-argue Œ very 
pleasantly, but also very intellectually, a
nd I find Œ I found that they were way 
ahead of us as far Œ intellectually as diffe
rent ideas, which, even though I™d had 
theological training, I was not ready to  di
scuss in such detail 
as the French were. 
Q: Was it stimulating for you? 

A: Very stimulating. And after awhile it 
got little Œ not boring, 
but it got Œ because 
they never seemed to finish
 their discussion. They ™d go
 on and stop in the middle of 
a sentence, and everybody knew what they were thinking, so
 you didn™t have to say 
anything, wh ich was a very typical French 
approach to it. I en
joy Œ had very good

relations with all the memb Œ we have, ev
ery six months maybe, 
a big retreat of all 
the workers, in Œ in the

 in the

Go up fo r just three or four days 
of just relaxation and discussions. 
Q: Skiing too? 
A: And skiing. 

Q: Did you try skiing th ere? 

A: Oh, I started skiing as a boy in 
Switzerland
 wh en I was 10 years old, so I loved 
to ski. Given it up now though, 
I haven™t skied for 30 years. 

Q: There was a man you mentioned who was in 
Rivesaltes
, and then  he was 
transferred to 
[indecipherable]
. His name was Mr. 
Kaufman
. Do you remember? 
He was about 63, and Œ 

A: I reme mber he was trying to  get out, like mo
st refugees to Œ to the west, either to 
America
 or 
South America
 or anyplace out of 
France
. 
Q: Do you Œ 
A: And I don™t remember whether Œ I think he probably  eventually  made it, 
although our Œ our job Œ there was certain 
organizations that were specializing, like 
the Unitarians, and the Jewish organization 
specialized in immigr
ation, both  Œ I wi 
Œ I can say it now, both legal 
and illegal. If th ey could 
get the permits to leave 
France
, they had to have
 
permits to get into
 Spa in
. And if they couldn™t get them, 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

22
they would have studen ts who™d ta
ke them over the border, over the 
Pyrenees
, or 
into 
Switze rland
. We had a number of students who were able to get into
 
Switzerland
, like 
Hans Solomon
 and his five friends ma de it once into 
Switzerland
, got into the 
Valais
, which is southern  part of 
Switzerland
, and were 
stopped at the Swiss border by the Swi
ss guards who were from that area, given a 
nice, big bowl of soup, and then  sent back in to
 France
, cause 
Switzerland 
said 
they just can™t take every
body who wants to come to 
Switzerland
. 
Q: So what happened ? 
A: Eventually Œ eventua
lly they got back into 
Rivesaltes
, and then we arranged for 
them to ge Œ try again, and not to go in to the 
Vala is
, which was much stricter th an Œ 
than say 
Gen e va
 or 
Va ud
. And ev entu ally made it across, and we had visas Œ visas 
for them, so that this time there™s no problem. 

Q: To go from 
France
 into 
Switzerland
? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you arranged fo r that? 
A: We did, through th
e organization, yes. 
Q: The European Œ 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
23
A: Eur-European  student, or through the 
Cimade
. 
Cimade 
was very good at that, it 
was one of their jobs, and th ey had you
ng students who were acting as guides across 
the mountains, so Œ 
Q: Was Œ were you in contact with 
Garel
, the 
Garel 
rescue network? They were 
work ing with the Jewish organization 
OS E
. They also bro
ught children into 
Switzerland
. Were you in contact with them? 
A: Very vaguely. Not Œ I™d say we were
 not specializing in
 immigration Œ or 
emigration, but you couldn™t 
help get invo
lved in it. 
Q: You mentioned that many of the students 
come to see you, and some of them are 
violinists, or they want to study medici
ne. And in your diary you seem to advise 
them to learn a trade, a handicraft, so 
they can make a living, and they seem 
reluctant to do so. Do you remember anythi
ng Œ what you were thinking at that 
point about Œ 

A: I think it was mo re of a practical approa
ch to know that they
 Œ you wanted them 
to continue their studies, but that took a 
[indecipherable]
, a place to live and steady 
income, which we co Œ we could not pr
ovide, I mean, we couldn™t provide. We 
gave out very little mo ney, as far as help, ju
st in emergencies. And that was true of 
mo st of the organizations, they  tried not to  
just hand out money. 
But I thought, so if 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
24
I recommend that they learn a trade, at leas
t they can earn a living. What we did Œ 
the story of the 
Chambon
 is another, different story. 
Q: Could you tell us about that? 
A: Yeah, in ni Œ at the end of ™41, we fi 
Œ figure that the students Œ we wanted to do 
something for the students, a
nd there was a committee o f the 
ESRF
 in 
France
 with 
Professor 
Lagalle
(ph) from Œ from 
Montpellier
, who was the head of the 
committee Œ French committee. 
A nd we figured we had to 
get the students into an 
atmosphere where they could really continue
 their studies. We looked over southern 
France
, and a Mr. 
Guillome
(ph) who was a Œ wo rked  for the Œ a Frenchman who 
w o rk ed  fo r th e 
YMCA
, been mayor of a little town 
Chambon-sur-Lignon 
[indecipherable] 
and so we went up to see 
Chambon
, which is very up in the 
mountains, and a very  rural area, and fo und
 out that they  had a treme Œ there are 
two pastors there, Pastor 
Truckmay
(ph) and Pastor try Œ 
Tise
(ph), who are very 
much the leaders of the 
community, and they had already had a numb er of 
ma iso n  
d™enfants 
open at the Swiss Red Cross, that a 
couple may Œ wh ere they could bring 
children and take care of them during thatŒ in that manner. And th e main difference 
between 
Chambo n et Œ
 the whole area, the platea
u and gau Œ and southern 
France
 
on the coast, was there was plenty of food 
there. For the first ti
me in I don™t know 
how many months, I found butter. That sh Œ 
one ra Œ th ing th at struck me, I would 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

say made the decision that we shoul
d try and settle a Œ a home there was, 
Melby
 
and I were looking for a hotel, or for a pl
ace where we could Œ fo r a place we could 
rent to put students into . We Œ and we 
[indecipherable]
 the hotel overn ight, went 
out in th e mo rning. And th e people next to us had had 
[indeciphera ble]
 breakfast 
sent up, and they put it out 
in the hall, and there were
 two pound Œ tw o patés of 
butter left on the plate, so 
Melby 
and I immediately scooped it up and decided this 
is where we wanted to be. So we did find a 
Maison des Roches, 
which the hotel, 
we were able to rent it and then had to 
staff it with a director and so mebody could 
run the place. 
Q: And who did you finally find? 
A: There was a miss Œ miss Œ Madame 
Pon-Pontay
(ph), I think the names were. 
And then eventually 
Da niel
 
Truckmay
(ph), the nephew of one of the pastors took 
over. And over the year which we were in 
operation, there were
 about 75 different 
students who were able to take advantage 
of Œ mo st of them would Œ would come 

settle down, or they would decide to try to go to 
Switzerland
, or disappear into the 
Maquis
, the resi Œ resistance. So it was, fro
m that point of view, very successful, 
and we were able to, as I say, get about 75 
students out of the ca
mps, because this is 
one thing the go-government, or the 
Nîmes 
committee h ad pushed for was 
Vichy
,
 
get people out of the camps, and into a mo re or less normal living.

Q: 
Chambon
 is also a Protestant village. 
A: 
Chambon
 was very definitely a Protestant village. 
Q: And that may have influenced your choice? 
A: I think that 
[indecipherable]
 was a Protestant village, the whole area was 
Protestant, had been since the seven Œ 15
th
, 16
th
 century, with the Hu guenots. But 
the fact that there were the two pastors he
re who were very su
pportive of our work, 
and are able to supervise the Œ the 
Maison des Roches
. 
Q: I want to go back to 
Rivesaltes
 a little. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Do you reme mb er the commander Œ 
commander of the camp, Commandant 
Hubert
(ph), did you ever meet with him? 

A: I did, but not a great deal, I didn™t have 
that mu ch to do with him. I Œ I know o Œ 
I meet all the commanders, cause you had to 
call, and then wh en you first went to 
the camp, then you go in and ju
st let them know you™re here. 
Q: Every time you went to a camp, did you 
have to have an authorization by the 
prefect? 

A: Right. 
Q: For every trip? 
A: Every trip. 
[indecipherable]
 stopping the prefectur
e and getting a permit.

Q: At one point you seemed to say, oh, the secretary™s 
signature will do. Didn™t you 
get to be a little more cavalier as time went on? 
A: I suppose after you™ve been th ro ugh the same thing and asked fo r the same kind 
of paper, you get s Œ y
ou get accepted, and Œ 
Q: Who was Mr. 
Froenial
(ph)? You mentioned a messie Œ Mr. 
Froenial
(ph) and he 
seems to be co
nnected to the 
[indecipherable]
. Was he a deputy director? 
A: I don™t Œ I don™t recall. That™s a long time ago. 

Q: I know. At one point you come back to 
Rivesaltes
, and in your diary you 
mention that you are appalled by th e state, th
e health of the Œ of the people. Could 
you elaborate on that a little, please? 

A: I Œ I re Œ of course, the conditions 
in the camp were always very mini Œ 
minimu m, and I think this wa
s towards the end of Œ or in
 ™42, where the conditions 
Œ the camp, you know, was on a beach, 
and the conditions around it weren™t too 
great. Cold and windy and th
is particular time when  I come back, I go and visit 
people in the c Œ in the 
[indecipherable]
 or in the barracks. And Œ and th-this time I 
went to the barracks, cause you could Œ th
ey had a real black 
market going on in 
every barrack, where if you wanted some
thing special and you had money, you 
could get it. In other wo rds chocolate, or 
extra bread or something. But this time I 
came back and people just 
looked worn  out and tired and hungry, of course. And 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
28
they™d Œ and they™d lost any desire to 
do any we Œ or activities were very minimum 
because nobody had the strength to
 go to the foyer or read, 
or to play an instrument. 
And the men, particularly, were just st
arving away. And there was not a thing we 
could do except just encourag
e them to try and make some plans, which was very 
difficult, I mean, plan what 
their life, I mean, have a goal of some kind. And they 
would ju st kind of pull the blankets up over
 them and just lie there. S o  those are 
conditions that, I don™t know what anybo
dy could have done
 to improve them 
[indecipherable]
 cause the food was 
[indecipherable]
, vegetables, nothing very  
substantial, it™s one piece of bread, which 
made a very de Œ very  depressing visit. 
Q: Sometimes you stayed several days in the camp. 

A: I Œ usually I™d try and sp end Œ 
Q: You had a bag to sleep in? 

A: Yes, I slept Œ well, the 
Cimade
 personnel were sleeping in  Œ in one of the 
barracks, had their own rooms, so I had a guest room I could Œ could stay wh en I 
was there. 
Q: Can you describe it, what
 they looked
 like inside? 
A: Small, little cupboard, not much 
of anything. They 
were not fancy. 
Q: Was it Œ what were the conditions Œ 

A: No Œ no ra Œ 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

29
Q: Œ cold, hot? 
A: Both. One or the other. It™s either very
 cold, or else the wind was blowing and it 
was Œ there was a breeze, and it was a hot wind.
 But the Œ no ru Œ 
no running water. 
The toilet facilities were all 
army centered, built on the Œ 
up above the ground, and 
two holes in the ground. We did have our 
own Œ we had a key to
 one of th-their 
facilities th at were lined up, about six or 
seven holes, and entrance to each one, and 
we had a key to one of the place we could use. 
Q: Was it reserved for the 
Cimade
 personnel? 
A: Cima Œ 
Cimade
, all the personnel, whether Red Cr
oss or others. So conditions in 
camps Œ 
Rivesaltes
 was particularly depressing beca
use of the heat, and the Œ not 
sand, but kind of rock  Œ rocky soil. And 
overcrowded, of c
ourse. And then you 
never knew when  there™s gonna be another 
exodus, or Œ th en the Germans insisted 
that the Germans Œ the Germans in
 the camp  be sent back to 
Germany
. It was kind 
of an interesting way in wh ich Œ I suppos
e about a hundred thousand Germans were 
sent to 
France
, cause 
Hitler 
gave the Œ the gauleiter, that is the heads of certain 
sections of 
Germany 
permission to just do wh at they 
wanted besides just get rid of 
the Jews. So the one near the 
French border in southwestern 
Germany
, so it™s 
simple, we™ll just send them to 
France
. So they shipped them all down to 
France
, 
to 
Gurs
,
 Rivesaltes
, other camp s. And then  a year or so later they wanted them

back. That™s when the convoys
 started. Those pictures you saw were of a convoy 
being prepared, which was always a ve
ry dramatic time, because Œ well, 
Andre 
Dumas
, who was one of the head  
Cimade
 people in th e camps, got to know the 
directors and the soldiers all much better 
than I did. And fo r one convoy he sat in 
with the director and decided wh o would 
Œ I mean, not who wo
uld go, but whether 
there was a discrep Œ whether families bei
ng separated. And he™d argue with the 
man, no you can™t send her, because her hu
sband™s here, or vice-a-versa. And he 
tried Œ 

Q: Did th at work ? 
 
A: What? 
Q: Did that wor Œ su cceed? 
A: It worked Œ it Œ it Œ it wo
rked in that he was able 
to keep several families 
together, but also it took su ch a toll on him, 
cause if he took out one person, another 
person had to take
 their place. And 
Andre 
went oh Œ decided he
 just couldn™t 
morally do this any more.  

Q: It seems you Œ you reflect
 in your diary ab out the ab
surdity of th
e situation. 
Sometimes a woman™s husband is 60, so he
™s excluded from a Œ a transport. And 
then she™s 50 and Œ and she Œ she™ll be 
on it, because she™s too young to  be

31
excluded. And if she was actually 
Ro manian, but she was born on the 
Czechoslo vakian bord er or something like that. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did Œ did you try to find wa
ys of getting around these Œ 
A: You try anything, but then
 you also run into the mo ral dilemma , di Œ wh at right 
do you have to decide that th
is person should go on this 
[indeciphera ble]
. The 
refugees didn™t know fo r sure where they 
were going, I suppose 
they had some idea. 
But we™d already by then learned about 
Auschwitz
, so the dilemma was, can we 
really decide that this person should not go
, or should go? Now the director of the 
camp had to make the choice, but that was his job. 
End of Tape One 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

Beginning Tape Two 
Q: Going back to Œ to our discussion abou
t the state you found pe
ople in Œ in Œ in 
Rivesaltes
, and the fact that when 
they™re physically so weak
 and sick, that morally 
and intellectually, they 
have no Œ no desire Œ 
A: They have Œ they  no Œ not only no de
sire, but no goal. As long as they had a 
goal, whether it was ju st to live another da
y or so, and they could see some hope in 
the future, I think that would encourage th
em to try and do something. But when 
they just kind of give up and see no fu ture 
at all, then that™s very depressing, not 
only for themselves, but for everybody else
. Because there™s real
ly nothing you can 
do, you can™t give them what they really 
need, is mo re food, because you don™t have 
it. 

Q: At one point you talk about one 
of the meetings of the Committee de 
Nîmes
, and 
Dr. 
Vay
(ph) gave his report. Do  you rememb
er? He was mentioning about, he was 
talking about the dire state of people in 
the camp s, and in your
 diary you reflect on 
that, and you Œ because he said that peopl
e were Œ they tried 
helping them by giving 
them mo re food, or giving them shots, 
and they  were too far gone. And th at Œ 
A: I think a s Œ I think a person reaches a 
point where they™ve lost interest. Either 
they™ve lost a mate, or
 they™ve just seen other people 
go re Œ go downhill, you might 
say. And once that happens, it™s awfully ha
rd to get them back. And you can™t do it 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
33
with just food, you have to give them 
some reason for living. And it™s true they 
have no reason for living, if th
ey™re gonna be sent off to 
Auschwitz
. Why bo ther? 
Q: Did you question your be
liefs, your religious faith, because of that? Did that 
make you reflect on wh at yo
u had been studying, or Œ 
A: Well, it makes you Œ well, it certainly 
makes you reflect on wh at you™re doing, 
whether there™s anything else you can do. 
You can™t give up hope on them, because 
then you™ve also gotten in th
e same situation that they
™re in. So it™s a matter o f 
maintaining your own spiritual feelings a
nd beliefs, that there™s gotta be a better 
place, and a better time. But you Œ if
 you can™t see any future, I mean, 
France
 was 
in a very sad situation, economically a
nd e-every way. And I think I found that 
particularly true right Œ right after the big 
debacle, the French co
uldn™t realize what 
happened to them. They
 knew they had the bi
ggest army in Œ in 
Europe
, and it just 
disappeared , dissolved . 

Q: You also mentioned that you were worri
ed about the capacity 
to adapt of people 
who had been immigrating and moved 
around from place to place, and Œ 
A: This was the difficulty, you would Œ 
ev erybody wanted to get out, and not 
everybody would put in a request for an  exit visa, or for a visa from Œ and 
everybody had friends. Like there was one 
Œ one person who was di
f Œ different Œ di 
Œ whose rel Œ relative work ed 
in the church office in 
New York
, Dr. 
Forell
(ph). 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
34
And of co urse, he took a personal interest in
 this relative, and wrote to us about his 
relatives in the camp. I said, well, if you 
can get him a visa, that the best thing you 
could do. Well, even with a
ll his connections, he couldn™t get a visa for her. So you 
had to tell a person, well, not now, but keep  on hoping, keep Œ so it was not 
surprising th at people would 
try and walk out of the camp
 and head for the frontier. 
Q: Do you reme mb er if 
any of th em were caught? 
A: Oh, some were caught, I mean the Œ 
I don™t know how ma
ny hundred s had tried 
to get across. But Œ well, even, for instan ce, a person with an American passport, 

and a visa like 
Ronald
 
Elliot
, who was one of the leaders of the World Student 
Christian Federation, came to visit. This was before 
America
 was in the war, of 
course. And he had an exit permit, a
nd wi Œ so he came down  to visit 
Rivesaltes
, 
which is fairly near to th
e border. And we™d showed 
him around and spend the day 
or so with him showing him different part
s of the camp and situation. Then he got 

on th e train to go to  
Cerbere

Spa in
, and was turned down  
for some reason, they didn™t
 accept his exit visa. So he™d come back and we spent 
another day with him, put him on the train ag
ain, about three times
 before he finally 
got across. And he had all the papers he n
eeded, but s-some folk
s in there along the 
way decided well, why should I let him go? So  Œ

Q: You mentioned that sometime s the guard
s gave you trouble, 
going from one part 
of the camp to the other because perhaps 
they didn™t recognize you, or they had 
orders, or other times they let you go right thro ugh. 
A: Well the camps were not run in very 
fashionable, very military way, and the 
thing that Œ oh, I think I mentioned that Madame 
Jurano
(ph), who was a Swiss 
lady, a very good friend from 
Switze rland 
down visiting, and she got so mad when 
the Œ she went into the camp and there wa
s the guard smoking, and talking to  her 
with cigarette in his mouth. And being the 
good Swiss, she felt that  was disgusting. 
But that was typical of the camps, I mean, 
s-sol Œ soldiers were not Œ they were 
civilian guards, or soldiers, they just had no
 discipline at all. So
 you could Œ in one 
way it was very easy to  get in and out of
 th e camp , another way you never knew 

when  they  were gonna crack down  and make it mo re difficult. 

Q: At one point you Œ you 
mention even organizing activities for them because they 
seem to be bored . 
A: Oh, they were. I mean, who likes to sta
nd at a gate for eight, 10 hours? It didn™t 
work out too well, cause they™d come one
 time and then not show up fo r another 
month or so. 
Q: At one point you mentioned looking fo r the 
Madagascarians
, or the people 
from 
Madagasca r
.

A: 
Madagascar
. 
Q: And could you tell me a little about them? 
A: Well see, this was a mil Œ originally a 
military camp, and it was set up for troops 
in north
 Africa
. The beginning of the war, they™d co
me and stay there, then go up to 
the fr Œ to the front lines. 
And evidently these were 
Madagascarans
 who were in Œ 
recruited to fight and then the war was ove
r, so they didn™t come
. Eventually they 
came to work in the Œ to work
 in the work camps. See, 
the Germans, or the French 
and Germans tried to put ever
ybody Œ every male,  into wo
rk camp, cause there were 
so many soldiers who were still p risoners in euro Œ in 
Germa ny
, and they needed a 
lot of workers. In fact, some of our students were sent over to 
Brest
, which was a 
big submarine base for the Germans, and 
worked in the found
ations there for a 
while, until some colonel, German colonel 
found out they were Jewish and sent 
them back. 
Q: You mentioned in 
Marseilles
 somebody comes in and 
wants some workers from 
Rivesaltes
. 

A: Yes. 

Q: What did he want them to do? 
A: Probably  labor. 
Q: He heard that you had ch eap labor? 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
37
A: Labor, maybe a farm, maybe work. It™s
 amazing when you take out a whole 
army  of young men, how qui Œ ha
rd it is to get anything done. 
Q: You mentioned you rememb er when 
United States
 enters the war after 
Pearl 
Harbor
, and you write in your diary on th
e ninth of December, 1941 that we™ve 
entered the war. And that is the beginn
ing of a period of uncertainty  for you, 
because you don™t know if you™ll be 
able to continue your activities. 
A: Well, we knew th at the Germans were in contro l at 
Vichy
, although not openly, 
and I™m sure they are not happy to see
 America
 come into the war, or the Œ or in th 
Œ in fact, for a while, as I recall, w e, after 
Pearl Harbor
, 
Japa n
 declared war on us, 
and we declared war on 
Japan
, but not on 
Germa ny
 for about a week or so. So Œ 
Q: You mentioned that you went into 
Les Milles
 and somebody told  you that they 
had a Œ a secret radio. 
A: Yeah. I suppose every camp had some secret radios like that
. They try and hide 

and so th ey get news long be
fore we would. But that Œ 
Q: What was your feeli
ng when  you heard that 
United States
 had en tered the war? 
A: I suppose like everybody else, kind of
 shocked. And then, course I started 
thinking whether we should re
ally get out, or we could Œ 
Lo wrie
, I know at one 
time, wanted to leave right 
away  and go back to the 
States
, he wanted to get 
involved in the war effort. An
d I guess he found out it wasn™t
 that easy to get out as

quickly. Eventually he went to 
Switzerland
, along with, I think, most of the other 
Americans who were work ing in one of th
e various organizations. But at the time 
we didn™t know whether we™re gonna be take
n, put into camps, 
as the Americans in 
Germany
 were, of course were. But there they
 had the protection of the consulate, 
we had no protection at all.
 And we could have joined  the people in the camp s. 
Q: That was a serious consideration. 
A: It was, very definitely, whether we 
should try and leave while we still could. 
Q: And you decided to stay on? 

A: We decided to stay on, th
at we had a responsibility to
 work. And there was no, at 
the time there was no outward 
expression from the Germans 
[indecipherable]
 still 
unoccupied. I think the thing that took it 
off was the French navy was down in Œ in 
the 
Mediterranean
. 
Q: 
Toulon
? 
A: In 
To ulo n
. And the Œ eventually, the German
s wanted the navy and the Œ the 
French scuttled the ships, which was a big 
blow to the Germans.
 I think the German 
after that were Œ were much more strict. 
And eventually they di
d just take over all 
of 
France
. 
Q: And what happened at that point? 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
39
A: At that point we were Œ had either gone to 
Switzerland
 or went Œ actually, I 
think I talked to 
one of the young 
Cimade
 fellows who had helped  smuggle people 
into 
Switze rland
. He showed me how to
 get across the barbed 
wire. Take your coat 
off, throw the coat over, then
 jump oh Œ jump over, but 
I didn™t have to do that, 
fortunately. 
Q: Let™s go back a little. There was a poi nt where the French were inspecting the 

camps. They had a man named 
Andre Jonfur
(ph), who was from 
Vichy
, and he 
was doing a report on the camps. Do you re
member ev er being 
present when there 
were 
Vichy
 officials visiting the camps? 
A: Oh, I must have been th
ere at times, I don™t recall any mention with them, or 
meeting them. 

Q: There was also a point where the German general 
Danika
(ph) started visiting th e 
camps. It w as in July 1942. You Œ do y
ou have Œ rememb er hearing ab out that? 
A: I remember hearing the Ge
rmans were coming to visit. 
Q: But you weren™t present? 
A: No, I wasn™t present. 

Q: Was anyone you 
know present, like 
Dumas
 or 
Lowrie
? 
A: Oh, I Œ 
Lo wrie Œ  Lo wrie 
didn™t go into  the camp s too mu ch. He Œ that was the 
functionaries of the higher 
govern ment. No, I don™t reme
mber. Those are the things

he kind of just took for granted. He kne
w th e Germans could come in any time, and 
there were Germans stationed in 
Marseilles
, but the French wanted very little to do 
with them. 
Q: 
Rivesaltes
 kept changing its dis
position. Apparently they
 kept moving people 
from one 
ilo
(ph) and barracks to another. And you
 mention that you had to change 
your barrack s and your 
foyer
. How Œ do you know wh -why that happened? 
A: I think what Œ th e reason th
ey moved the internees from one 
ilo
(ph) to  the other, 
they had certain 
ilos
(ph) that they were getting ready 
to  ship people out in, and they 
wanted to get them into a barracks all together. 
Q: Did you know th at? 
A: Oh, I knew that was the reason for their shifting them. 
Q: But you shifted your 
foyer 
with them? 

A: We didn™t shi Œ we didn™t 
Œ I don™t think we shifted the 
foyer
 at all. 
Q: Did you see any changes in the camp, 
was more barbed wire, or more Œ or Œ 
A: Not mo re barbed wire, but you coul
d tell when a convoy was being organized, 
because everybody was more or less on thei
r Œ on edge and ne
rvous about who was 
going, who wasn™t going. 
Q: How did that work ? Were you Œ you we
re present when they were starting to 
prepare the convoys? 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
41
A: Well, we were present that we were doing 
our job in th e camp s, in trying to keep 
as normal a situation as possible. 
Q: You were still bringing 
in paper and paints and Œ 
A: Penci Œ pencil Œ 

Q: Œ and mu sical instruments. 

A: Right. We were trying to keep things
 going as simp ly as possible, but always 
behind, you know, in  the background ther
e was always this uncertainty about who 
was going to  show up. And 
once they got
 into the 
ilo
(ph) that was being evacuated 
or sent out, then 
they Œ that was Œ 
Q: Do you remember which
 ilo
(ph) it was? 
A: I don™t recall which one. 

Q: Do you remember who put the 
list together, it was the comman Œ 

A: The commandant Œ well, the Germans 
would ask for say, 150 Jews, and the 
commandant would have to pick  out 150 people to go. 
Q: Were there times w h en you actually we
nt and said Œ you Œ you to ld me you 
didn™t want to be involved in th e choice,
 but did you plead for somebody at one 
point? 

A: I Œ I didn™t, cause I was in a little diffe
rent situation. The French could do it, 
because they were talking to
 Frenchmen. But I didn™t 
feel it was my job as an

American to get involved in it. And th
en the French even
tually Œ and the 
Cimade
 
eventually, as 
I said before, 
Andre Dumas
 found out he just couldn™t do it morally 
any more. 
Q: Do you Œ you have a camera with you, and Œ 
A: Had a what? 

Q: Œ You have a camera with you at Œ at some point. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Because there are pictures that 
were with your collection in Œ in 
France
, and 
they were pictures of the Œ what we th
ink are the deportation convoys. Do you 
reme mb er how that was set up? You got 
up in the morning and all of a sudden 
people Œ 
A: Well, you knew something was coming 
up, because people getting very nervous 

and uncertain. So when
 they actually started assemb
ling people, get ready for th e 
trucks, I think we all were in a very Œ 
very near there with
 an open window. We 
couldn™t go over to the ke Œ to the convoy,
 of course, because the Œ there were 
soldiers Œ there were not a lot of soldiers
 around, there were so
ldiers around, but Œ 
so that™s when I took the 
pictures, from inside of the Œ a window, about a hundred 
yards away.

Q: What was your mo tivation in  taking the pi
ctures? As some sort of proof that this 
was going on? 
A: I think just it was another event in th
e camp. Always a sad one, and discouraging 
one, but Œ 

Q: Did people Œ 

A: Œ I happened to have my camera. 

Q: How did Œ how did people prepare for it?
 Were they allowed to take something 
with them? 

A: Oh th ey Œ they were 
told to pack a su
itcase, th-they have to carry it. 
Q: Were there children? 
A: Not many children, no, mo
stly adults. But there were 
families. Alth
ough by then 
I think mo st of the small children had be
en taken out by the Swiss Red Cross, or 
[indecipherable]
 
enfant
. 
Q: How long did this go on, the prepar
ation and th e gathering of th e people 
together? 
A: Oh, oh, the whole thing 
culminated in one day. 
Q: They Œ 
A: Where th ey did bring th e people out, a
nd th ey were standing th ere, of course. 
Their friends were standing around saying goodbye. And then th e Œ the

[indecipherable]
 all the trucks showed up, and they  
put them into the trucks to take 
them to the railway station. 
Q: They were open trucks? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And they  went Œ 

A: Those were big, coal burning
 trucks that smelled terrible. 
Q: Did th e people Œ were the people given 
anything to eat or dr
ink while they were 
waiting? 

A: I don™t think so. I don™t think th ey were fed Œ 

Q: They waited all day without anything? 
A: I™ll say it didn™t take too long, once th
ey  got them assemb led, and just brought 
the trucks in and took them out. 
Q: And Œ 

A: Not a very pleasant time, but th-th Œ 
you always wo nder well Œ well, should we 
have done something, but then  what Œ 
what could you have done? You certainly 
could not revolt, or start a revolution. 

Q: Were there people 
who Œ who were saying
 goodbye and didn™t Œ 
A: Oh yeah, because th-the
se were their friends. Most of the people had come 
together from 
Germany
, and had shipped down here
 and known  each other in 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

Germany
 for years, maybe. And then for so
me reason one group was sent off Œ 
sent back to 
Germany
, and others was kept in the camp. And ev entually th e camp 
was Œ I assume was completely liquidated. 
Q: You™re just talking about 
Rivesaltes
? 
A: Yes, but that was after Œ after I™d left, and after 
America
 was in the war. Now, 
the Spaniards were still there, had been th
ere for oh, probably four or five years. 
Could I take a quick break and stre
tch my  Œ my  leg going to  sleep. 
[break]
 You 
want to talk more about deportation? 
Q: Do you remember we were talking 
about how people were saying goodbye and 
they were Œ were there Œ was there ev
er a mo ment where somebody was on th e 
truck, or ready to get on the 
truck and then  they didn™t go? 
A: Yeah, there were times 
like that, when people Œ 
Q: Can you describe that? 

A: Well, it™s always dramatic, because nor
mally they tried to run things very 
smoothly, ju st put people on 
the truck and drive away. And 
then if at the last minute 
there™s a change in people, 
like if somebody in
tervened , or if somebody else had 
called
 Vichy
 with a name of a person they 
wanted to take off, or Œ and 
Vichy
 would 
respond to th e camp, they™d have
 to take them off the truck. 
Q: And what could be some of the reasons
 that the person wo
uld be taken off? 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
46
A: Oh, who knows? Hard to sa
y. They had enough influenc
e to Œ to get through to a 
min ister in  
Vichy
. It would take quite Œ quite a deal
 of influence, but then many of 
these Œ ma ny of the Germans had been 
functionaires
, had been important people in 
Berlin
 or in 
Germany
, and may have known the Fren ch deputies, or some Œ I 
mean, I Œ I don™t know what it was, but
 it could be any one Œ any reason. 
Q: And when the person actually
 had to get off the truck? 
A: Truck. Then  there™d be somebody else
 who™d be put in their place, which was 
real dramatic cause they™d
 Œ they™d say they cut 
[indecipherable]
 150 people and 
stop there, the next 10 people in line would 
be sent back to the barracks, or be kept 
there until the trucks left, if they didn™t ha
ve to change. So it™s Œ it was dra Œ always 
dramatic an d tragic time, cause you hate 
to see anybody Œ anybody be taken aw ay. 
Q: Did you know ex actly wh
ere they were going? You 
knew they  would go to the 
Rivesaltes 
train station, but did you know wh
ere they were headed after that? 
A: Up to  
Paris
, I think it™s in 
Drancy
 where the camp was, 
and they™d probab ly 
spend some time there, a
nd then they go back to
 Œ then  they™d go to  
Germany
. 
Where they Œ which camp they went to, 
Buchenwald
 or 
Auschwitz
, wherever they 
Œ or in so me cases they were Œ if they
 were young enough, 
they go back to 
Germany
 and they  put them under work camp s. Because 
Germany
 needed a Œ 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
47
needed a lot of workers too 
with th e whole army  out of 
the country . So you couldn™t 
Œ you couldn™t say for sure or not. 
Q: At the end of the day, what 
was the atmo sphere around th e camp? 
A: Very somber. Very quiet. Nobody rea
lly felt like doing anything, because you™d 
been pretty well drained just wa
tching them leave. So what Œ 
Q: Was your religion 
any consolation?  
A: They what? 
Q: Was the Bible or religion any consolation?  
A: I don™t think so. I suppo Œ I think th ere ma y have been  a service of some kind, 

but not necessarily. No, it was more or less 
just a complete let 
down wh en you work  
with people for a number of months, and 
then some of them disappeared. I guess 
fortunately, we didn™t know fo
r sure where they
 were going. 
Q: How Œ did you Œ you we
re present at several of these events, of these 
deportations? 
A: I think only a couple.
 
 
Q: Were you ever present in other camp s 
when people were being sent on to  this 
type of action? 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong  
 
June 11, 2009 
 

 
 
48
A: No, I Œ they more or le
ss transfer one camp to the 
other, and the camps are all 
different.
 Gurs
 and 
Rivesaltes
 were probably the two big camps for German Œ 
German refugees. 
Vern et 
was more of a political Œ political prisoners. 
Q: You also went to 
No é
 and 
Recebedou
? 
A: 
Recebedou
 yes, I do rememb er those two well. 
Q: And 
Les Milles
? 
A: 
Les Milles
 was right next to  
Marseilles
 and Œ and that was a mo re hopeful 
camp, cause that™s where they were Œ thos
e who had their first 
papers in order and 
had to get mo re papers would ca Œ go to 
Les Milles
 cau se then they go into 
Marseilles
, see the consulates and work  on ge
tting their final papers together, so 
that was a Œ much more of a transient cam
p,  even though very
 active with artists 
and Œ and a library. 
Q: When  you knew that the Œ you Œ you we
re present at two of these convoys, did 
you find out when others
 were going to  occu r? 
A: I don™t recall, I don™t 
think so, no way. I don™t th
ink an ybody knew because the 
germ Œ Germans would make the decisi
on, we need 150 or 200 or 300. 
Q: But every time you went back , you were
n™t sure the people you knew would still 
be there. 

A: That™s right, you™re never sure.

Andre Salamon

Liese

(ph)? 
A: Yeah, I Œ I knew the workers, I don™t 
recall them at all particular. I knew they 
had a good Œ 

Q: You did see them? 

A: I did see them, and knew they  had a go
od organization going. 
And th ey were Œ I 
think they were mainly inte
rested in trying to get th
ese wer Œ young people into  
some kind of a job work
, or training fo r jobs. 
Q: And also the children. 

A: Children, yeah. 
Q: Maybe we™ll take a break here. 
A: You want to Œ 

Q: Is that okay? 
[break] 
I want to go back to 
Rivesaltes
 again. 
A: Good. 
Q: And I want to talk a little bit about your
 contact with other groups, not just the 
students from 
Germany
. Do  you rememb er meeting the Span ish? 
A: Very much so, cause the Spaniards had b
een there for about th ree years, three or 
four years, since the end of 
the Spanish revolution, and th
ey™d pretty much settled in 
and made their own position there in the camp . 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

50
Q: Did th ey have mo re freedom than the others? 
A: I™d say they did because
 they™d been th
ere longer, and th
ey knew the way 
around. And th-they had no place to go 
either, they were Œ they weren™t too 
welcome in 
France
, but there Œ on the other hand, 
they took care of them, the 
French. 

Q: Did th ey have the same rations as 
the rest of the people in the camp? 
A: They must have had 
more, because they did th
eir own cooking. I think I 
mentioned once that they invited me over to
 dinner, and they c
ooked Spanish rice 
on an  open fire out in the middle of th
e camp. And served a very good dinner, 
which I appreciated. Food was pretty mu ch
 a central thought in ev erybody™s mind 
all the time. But Œ so when
 you had a good meal, th
en the Œ made a lot of 
difference. 

Q: Did you speak Spanish? 

A: No, I just 
como estsa
, that™s about it. 
Q: You communicated in French? 

A: French, yeah. They™d lear
ned en ough French by then  to
 get by. But they Œ they 
weren™t really internees so much as just reside nts in 
the camp, because I say,  
they had no place Œ they
 couldn™t go back to 
Spain
. 
Q: Did th ey make Œ were they
 part of the work brigades?

A: They were part of the leftist government. 
Q: But in Œ in 
Rivesa ltes Œ 
A: Oh. 
Q: Œ were they sent out to work ? 
A: No, as I recall, I don™t think so.  

Q: Did th ey come to your 
foyer
 to partake in artistic activ ities? 
A: They did, but not as thoroughly as we 
would have liked. They
 Œ they had pretty 
mu ch their own life, and th ey pretty Œ and 
they were pretty well, so well established 
that they had a family life.  

Q: Did they need Œ 
A: Having lo ts of children, and Œ 
Q: Did th ey need instruments, or Œ 

A: Some, yes, not Œ one or two of each. Yo
u™d find a violinist or a guitar player 
among th e Span iards. But I say, th-they alre
ady Œ they ™d been  there so long that 
they were Œ pretty much had a 
routine to their own life going. 
Q: Did th ey par Œ did they participate in
 some of the shows that were put on? 
A: Oh yeah, they would come to those. 
Q: And did they Œ did 
they perform in them? 
A: Once in a while, not Œ 
not a great deal, they Œ 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

52
Q: What kind of things did they do? 
A: Well, as I recall, the Spanish dances. 
They had more energy 
than the Germans, 
because they had, I suppose, better food that th
ey prepared themse
lves. But, course 
they wanted Œ they didn™t 
want to get too settled in 
France
, because they wanted to 
go back to  
Spain
 eventually after 
Franco
 left. But tha Œ they 
didn™t see any future, 
because they c Œ they knew
 they couldn™t go back to 
France
 Œ to 
Spa in 
w i th ou t 
being put in prison or shot. 
Q: Were you in contact with any of
 the other populations? There were 
Roma
 in the 
camps. 
A: Not too mu ch, they had their own life pr
etty much, so Œ and again, they were Œ 
di-didn™t have to stay, they could move out 
if they wanted. But ag
ain, they™d have to 
earn Œ earn the living someplace, and like in 
mo st countries, they were never fully 
integrated into th
e population. They had their own Œ own 
[indecipherable]
 and own 
Œ own life pretty much settled. It was a 
really mixture of people from all over, 
actually, 
Mediterranean 
area. 

Q: Did you know Œ it seemed in your Œ th
e diary that you mention mo re the people 
you knew in 
Rivesaltes
, it seems like you spen t mo re 
time there, or that you were 
able to Œ to creat
e more activities in 
Rivesaltes
. 
A: Than anyplace else?

Q: 
Gurs Œ 
A: No Œ 
Gurs Œ Gurs
 was very active, except 
Gurs 
Œ  my  ma Œ  main  memo r y  o f  
Gurs
 was the mud. It rained a lot up there, 
and once it rained there was no drainage 
in the camp, so you were wading in thro ugh
 mud. But that Œ that™s what deterred 
everything happening in 
Gurs
. 
Q: When  you brought things
 into the camps, whether it 
be paper or paints, or 
instruments or books, did you have to us
e ration tickets, was there Œ how Œ how did 
you go ab out buying th i Œ this Œ 
A: Oh, you could buy 
paper, pencils, pens. 
Q: And books? 
A: Books, if you could find books, or they
 were donated books. Instruments, I™m 
not sure where they came from, b u
t we were glad to have them. 
Q: But you had a budget for that? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It was from 
Geneva
, or from 
Marseilles
? 
A: Oh, no, well, the budget was for 
Marseilles
, for 
France
, but the money all came 
eventually from 
Geneva

Q: When  you had to  go about interviewing
 students to eventu ally you wanted  to 
take to 
Chambon
, how did Œ how did that process 
go about? Did you set up shop in 
Œ in one of the barracks and sa
y come in and talk to me? 
A: No, th ere are people you knew, having 
been there, and then the local French 
committees also would recommen d  students. 
Once in awhile there™d be a French 

student that needed help, 
or needed to get out, get 
away. So the 
local committee 
would do Œ run across students 
who needed  help. Cause see,
 we were there to work 
with all students, not just internees or refugees. 

Q: People who were living outside the camps. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And needed ma Œ they
 needed material help. 
A: And they  need ed a boost 
up at this time, because j
obs weren™t too plentiful in 
France
. 
Q: Was there an age limit for Œ for bringing students to 
Le Chambon
? 
A: Probably more a lower age limit. We 
needed Œ we weren™t looking for high 
school students, but there were
n™t too many of them anyway . 
Q: You Œ 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

55
A: 
[indecipherable]
 the top age limit, I don™t think th ere was any stated limit but by 
the fact that there weren™t too many olde
r Œ older students, sa
y over 40. There were, 
I think a couple older men, by that they™re in their 40s. 
Q: So when you finally got a list together of
 
say five boys that you would like to 
take to 
La Maison des Roches
, how did you go ab out Œ c
oncretely, what was the Œ 
what were the steps? 
A: Well, first you had to  get the releas
e from the camp , which means you had to 
prove that there was a place for them to go,
 and th at they would be Œ not beco me a 
charge to the state. 

Q: And who could give 
you that release? The 
co mmanda nt du camp
? 
A: Co mman d er 
du camp
. And then you had to get pe
rmission from the Œ for travel, 
of course, and then pe
rmission to settle in 
Chambon
 at the prefecture there. 
Q: So you needed  to go
 to the prefecture in

Q: And once you got those au
thorizations, you could Œ y
ou could take them out of 
the camp. 
A: Take them out, or they Œ they  could come on th eir own, like the five students I 
knew best just made their own arrangements. 
They ™d already had a Œ a border trip to 
Switzerland
, so they knew Œ well, 
mo st of them knew, pretty mu ch, how to get 
around. And the train service 
wasn™t too bad, it was slow
, so they arrived pretty 
much on their own. 

Q: And the first Œ the first 
students that you took in to 
Les Roches
 was Œ that was 
probably  around February ™42? 
A: I think Œ yeah, that™s when th e bulk of 
students seemed to 
have come, but there 
had been some there a little
 earlier, once the camp ha
d opened. Was a matter of 
getting not the camp, but getting 
La  Ro che
 opened. Main thi
ng was getting heating 
Œ heat for it, cause 
Chambon
 was cold weather and th ey  were coming out of the 
warm 
Mediterranean 
weather. So until you get it heated 
[indecipherable]
. 
Fortunately it was well furnis
hed. There were beds and blankets and everything else 
over there. 

Q: How m Œ what was the capacity at 
La
 
Maiso n  d e s Ro ch es
? 
A: Probably about 
20 at any one time.

llection that you left in Œ in 
Paris
 that you spen t a 
lot of time at 
La Chambon

A: No, I was just interested in getting 
it going, keeping it going, and Œ and it was 
our big wa Œ a big project for th
e European Student Relief Fund. 
Mel-Melby
 came 
down a couple times from 
Geneva

 not too far from 
Geneva
. 
Q: Were there any girls in the Œ in the house? 
A: No, I Œ I™m just trying to  think. I neve
r thought of that befo
re, probably not. I 
don™t know why, wh ether we never ran across 
girl students. Hard to say. No, I never 
thought of that before, th
at there were no girls. 
Q: When  did 
Daniel Truckmay
(ph) take over? You said there was a couple there 
and then  
Da niel 
took over. 
A: They stayed about 
a year as I recall, from January 
or February to  the beginning 
of ™42. And then 
Truckmay

Daniel Truckma y
(ph) was taken when  the Gestapo raided the camp  Œ raided  the Œ

when  were your last activities in 
France
? 
When  did you finally decide to leave 
France
, and who decided it? Was it your own 
decision? 
A: It was my decision to go back to 
Geneva
. That™s when the Germans 
[indecipherable]
 the Germans going to take over all of 
France
. So, as I recall, I 
went Œ mu st have been Novemb er or so. 
Q: And you took a trai n? 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: You have official papers? 

A: Noth ing special, I had just had to buy 
a ticket and Œ and Œ an
d of course I had 
American passport, which always he
lps. And I didn™t Œ I had a permit 
de ce jour
 for 
Geneva
, so I could always get back into 
Geneva
.  
Q: Who took over some of the work th
at you were doing in 
the camps when you 
left? 
A: Well, the 
Cimade
 was still there, you see.
 Cimade
 were all French. And Œ 
Q: 
Andre Dumas
? 
A: 
Andre Dumas
, 
Per
(ph)
 Griese

Q: Perhaps they were from 
Switze rland
. 
A: I imagine from 
Switze rland
. 
Q: So when you got back to 
Geneva
, what did you do? 
A: Oh ma-main work there was, well, 
of course there were refugees in 
Switzerland
, 
helping them get settled. Bu
t our main work was with pr
isoners of war, to identify 
students in the prisoner of 
war camps, particularly in 
Germany
, cause we were in 
Switzerland
. But we were doing the same in  
Canada
 with German prisoners, and Œ 
although I had nothing to do
 with the wo
rk in se Œ 
America
. But we were sending 
books and identifying, putting th
em in touch with their co
lleges, when we found out 
where they Œ where they had 
gone to college, and whether 
Œ I was glad to run across 
one who went to 
Ya le
 or 
Oberlin
.

Q: So from Œ 
A: So th at Œ so that Œ and I did that 
pretty much. Then  I had another activity, you 
see, there were a lot of American
 aviators who were interned in 
Swit zerla n d
, cause 
their plane was shot up and they  couldn™t get back to 
England
, so they pulled into 
Zu rich
, and of course, the Swiss interned th
em. But interned th
em up Œ then  the 
Swiss tourism office w as very dull in 
Switzerland
 there. Two Germans come in, 
but nobody else, so the hotels were empty, 
so the Swiss put them up in a nice big 
hotel up in Œ oh, wh at™s it called? Up in
 the mountains. So the av iators, once they 
got over the shock of be
ing shot down settled into kind 
of a touristy Œ touristy life. 
They could ski, and they had Œ they we
re getting paid still by the embassy, or 
getting it by the arm Œ air force. 

Q: And your official role was Œ were you a chaplain? 

A: Chaplain. 

Q: A Protestant chaplain. 
A: Protestant chaplain. 
Q: And did you hold  services? 

A: Regular services 
[in d ecipherable]
. And then any time pray
 if they were dead 
[indecipherable]
 we Œ Americans had a open cemetery in 
Münsingen
 outside of 
Bern
, so we™d hold a serv
ice for them there.

Q: At Œ at any point did you think about en
-enlisting to fight in the American armed 
services? 
A: I did in ™44. 
Q: And Œ 
A: After Œ and I did en list and went Œ actually
 th-the American aviators couldn™t get 
out of 
Switzerland
 until American troops had arri
ved on Swiss border. And then 
they stayed 
[indecipherable]
 wanted to get rid of them, we get a Œ and they  wanted 
to get back to 
England
. So they  brought in two Œ several planes, mu st have been 
two or 300. And I went out with th em, went to 
England
 with them, flew out with 
them. 
Q: And that™s when you enlisted? 
A: Enlisted then. 

Q: Did you go through some sort
 of training, 
or did you Œ 
A: Oh yeah, I went through basic training in 
England 
and in 
France
 and ended up 
in 
Germany
 in Œ well, let™s see, I-I was on my first leave in 
Paris 
on May 10
th
 
when  the war was Œ the

Q: Infantry. Infantry. And 
what were you doing in 
Germany
? You were sent with 
the second armo red division, or Œ 

A: No, I was Œ actually I was sent to Œ first to 
Marburg 
and a redevelopment camp  
or re Œ re-deployment camp, and I was ther
e for, I guess four or five months. They 
arrived there and they  found out I could sp
eak German, so they put me on the staff Œ 
or not staff, I mean, transferred me to 
their Œ they wanted 
somebody around to 
speak German. But then Œ 

Q: What did your duties consist of? 
A: Just being a sold ier. Not mu ch of anything, we Œ 
Q: But, interacting w
ith local population Œ 
A: Œ we Œ oh, we had Œ we had Œ no, as 
a re-deployment camp, 
the soldiers would 
come in from all over 
Germany
, being shipped home. 
And way Œ they spend 
maybe five or six days there before they were sent home, off to 
Brem en
, or take a 
ship back . And then
 my transfer to 
Berlin

education department in the German yout
h Œ the German youth activities sectio n.

became the head of the youth activities se
ctio n for American zone Œ American Œ 
American section of 
Berlin
. 
Q: But you were still in the army? 
A: Yes. Not ru Œ well, I was for a while, th
en I went back and demobilized and flew 
back in as a civilian, which was quite a 
switch. I remember I came back on a troop 
ship. 
Q: You went back to  the 
United States
 to demobilize? 
A: Right. 

Q: After the armistice? 

A: After, oh yeah , so it was Œ mu st have be
en ™45, end of ™45. Cause I remember I 
came Œ there was a freeze on hiri
ng, so I had Œ couldn™t get 
[indecipherable]
 right 

back. And eventually 
I had to come to 
Washington
, and wait for transportation 
through the 
Azores
. A nd I remember going out to the 
airport in my civilian clothes, 
and all these colonels and captains are on 
the same flight, and they  all stood around 
and waited for me to go on. Here I was, 
I™d been a buck sergeant, and I couldn™t 
figure out what this, after you sir. They  didn™
t know what my civ
ilian rank was, so 
that was an interesting time. 

Q: So you went back  to Œ to

Beginning Tape Three 
Q: So you decided to  go back to  the 
United States
 in 1949. Wh at made you decide 
to go back to the 
United States
? 
A: Well, I™d been out of the 
States
 for 10 years, I figured time I got back, and I was 
interested in getting into education, so I came back to 
Sta n fo rd
 for a year and got 
my teaching credential. 
Q: What made you want to go into  teac
hing? You were Œ it seemed that you might 
have been destined to be a 
minister or a pastor in Œ 
when  you went to divinity 
school. 

A: Oh, I was Œ I think I wanted something a little broader than just a minister, and a 
Œ and wo rking in th e educational branch  in 
Germany
, where Œ re-educating the 
German youth, I figure that education was 
the field I wanted to 
work in. So I came 
back and my wife and small ba
by and a German Sh epherd dog Œ 
Q: So you had Œ your family
 was your wife, your Œ y
our baby and the German 
Shepherd  at that point? 
A: Right. 

Q: In 1949. Wha-Wh at made you choose 
California
 and 
Stanfo rd
? 
A: My wife was from 
California
, and I had an uncle who was a superintendent of 
schools in 
Palo  Alto  
or 
Menlo Park
. And they  had a house we could use for a year

or so, wh ile I was go Œ while I was going to  
Stanfo rd
, that™s why Œ one reason I 
picked 
Stanford
. It™s a good school. 
Q: A very good school. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you feel a lot of cha
nge wh en you got back to the 
United States
? You™d 
been living in 
Euro pe
 for 10 years. 
A: Pretty much so. Not as
 much as I thought, cause
 I™d been in touch with 
Americans all along, and I™d been in the 
army long en ough to  realize that what I 
miss were all the little things
 that you forget about. 
Q: For example? 
A: Oh, ab out 
TVs
. We didn™t have a 
TV 
for a couple of years, so Œ for a number of 
years. And of course, driv
ing was no problem, but Œ 
Q: Why was it mo re of a problem, 
there was more traffic in the 
United States
? 
A: There was more tra
ffic than Œ than in 
Euro pe
, although I did have a car in
 
Euro pe
, but particularly around the big citie
s, traffic was heavy. Freeways were 
something new, alth
ough I™d been on the 
a u to ba hns 
in 
Germany
 which were 
enough of a problem. 

Q: So you finished your ma
ster™s degree in education? 
A: Right.

Q: And what was your next step? 
A: Looking for a job, a
nd I finally found one in 
[indecipherable] Coalinga
 in 
California
, which is in the 
Fresno Œ
 central part of 
California
, teaching world 
history to a bunch of kids 
who were growing up on farms 
in that area and were not 
interested in wo rld history, particular
ly, although a bunch of good students. 

Q: And did you teach 
any other subjects? 

A: French, a-and social studies. 
Q: Did you stay in the same
 school system for your Œ 
A: For three years, then went to 
Beirut
,
 Lebanon
, where I spent five years there at 
the international college. And th
en after five years in the 
Middle East
, I came b ack 
to southern 
California
, to  
Gard en Grove
 in Œ which is in 
Orange 
County, right 
next to 
Disneyland
, and stayed  there 25 years. Beca
me  principal of a high school. 
California 
was growing so fast in those days that
 first time I went there, there was 
one high school in 
Gard en Gro ve
, within 10 years there were seven high schools, 
with all the feeding schools. So I 
was principal for 10 years in southern
 California
. 
Q: Did you remain in contact with any of
 the people with whom you were friendly 
during th e war? 
Andre Dumas
, or 
Lowrie
? 
A: 
Andre Dumas
, I stayed in, 
Lo wrie
 I s Œ I stayed in t
ouch, mainly through 
Christmas letters. But I lost track of some of them.

Q: Is the time that you were working w
ith the European Student Relief Fund, and 
your activities in the camps, did that give you some sort of Œ some sort of skills, 
negotiating skills, or skills to Œ to 
Œ to learn to get things done?  
A: I think it gave me a greater appreciati
on of people, understanding of people. I™m 
not sure it gave me any special skills, exce
pt I think I found that Americans are not 
very much interested in 
Europe
. Right after the war, they™d
 had en ough of the war, 
and Œ and 
[indeciphera ble]
 so, in matter of teaching, you 
tried to bring in the things 
that had happened an d their influence on 
their lives, but most people were much 
mo re interested in getting jobs and buying cars and living.  

Q: At one point in your diary you are at a me eting of the 
Committee
 
de Nîmes
, and 
you™ve heard one of the dire reports that Dr. 
Vay
(ph) gave about 
malnutrition and Œ 
and you ha Œ you reflect upo
n what Œ that you thought 
man was intrinsically good, 
but maybe the cruelty and the absurdity th
at you saw around 
you shook you. And 
you seemed to talk about perhap s we are in
 the grips of demonic forces. Seems that 
you were Œ 

A: I don™t know if I went 
so f Œ well, maybe I have 
[indecipherable]
 demonic 
forces, but a Œ I certainly realized that th
e world was not a peaceful place, and that 
in some ways there was very little you co
uld do to make any 
changes. You could 
change individuals, and that™s why I conc
en trated on individuals and work ing with 

 
Interview with Tracy Strong

69
them, whereas major changes 
were something that it was really very difficult. You 
realize there™s gonna be 
crises around the world. 
[indecipherable] 
I was talking to a 
group of Œ actually at a Holocaust mu seum in 
Philadelphia
 and Œ where 
Ha ns 
Solo mon
(ph) was Œ lives. And one of
 the questions after this 
[indecipherable]
 
group of students who said, well, can the 
Holocaust ever happen
 again? The only 
thing I can say wi Œ look, there™s enough 
Œ enough Œ enough problems already, wa Œ 
like dur Œ like all in the middle Œ in the 
Middle Ea st
 and 
Serbia
, crises like that, in 
north  
Africa
. And I™m not sure we settled all thos
e yet. I ju-just hope that it never 
can happen again on such a schedu Œ scale. 
Q: When  you mentioned being able to pe
rhaps not change ev
erything, but wo rk 
with individuals, there™s a sense of Œ of hope and satisfaction wh en  you finally get 

some of those students out of 
Rivesaltes
 to the 
Chambon
. And that was an 
example maybe of as an individual. 

A: Well, that was Œ that was a big step, cau
se we work ed so long
 and hard we Œ for 
it, and then failed the first ti
me to get the nod and then  we
nt back a second time. But 
I think when  you see people ac
tually in the situation wh
ere they™re changing their 
lives, which it was, cause they could just 
as well have been on a convoy. Except 
they were all young, they would probably 
not go on to  a camp, they™d go on to a 
work camp someplace. But ther
e™s some satisfaction to kno w that you helped a few

people like that. It was a mu
ch mo re critical situation th an today, and change came 
about so quickly, too. 
Q: It gave you the co ur
age to keep  going on. 
A: They what? 

Q: If you Œ it gave you the courag e Œ it s
eemed to give you th e courage to keep 
trying. 

A: Yeah, it gi Œ gives you Œ you have to ha
ve some results, and some Œ I don™t want 
to say victories, but some positive results
, otherwise it becomes a pretty dreary 

world. 

Q: You remained in contact with 
Hans Solomon
(ph), or did you find that you 
connect with him again in 
Chambon-sur-Lignon
 in 2004? 
A: I saw him then and then I 
saw him earlier this year in 
Philadelphia
. So it was 
kind of pleasant to get back
 there and talk with him. 
Q: Is there something th at you would like to
 add ab out your experien ces in Œ during 
the war and what you accomplished,
 wh at you didn™t accomplish? 
A: I think as I reflect back 
on it, I realize the very ex
traordinary times. That I was 
very fortunate to be able to be in a s
ituation wh ere I could do some Œ some good, 
not very much. But it gave me an apprec
iation of difficulties people have and that 
you can do something, even t
hough very smal l, just by 
giving a person a book, or

crayons, or artists. At least give them te
mporary relief from their situation. That 
we™re not gonna solv e all the problems right away. 
Q: When  you started writing y
our diary and it seemed mo stly
 destined to Œ for your 
parents, sometimes you even  write to your
 mo ther and dad. Were you conscious 

that you were living in extr
aordin ary times and that you 
had to get it down, because 
you were actually in the mids
t of something exceptional? 
A: Well, I felt Œ first, my letters to my 
parents, we™ve always corresponded. And I 
felt if I could at least o p en up with some
body, and give them some sense of my  
feelings and my beliefs, that 
would help Œ help to go on 
to continue with the work. 
And the diary I just felt 
[indecipherable]
 this is a special time, and Œ 

Q: You mentioned that sometime s you felt 
lonely , and that you would like to come 
back and have somebody 
to talk to at night. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And you realized that to
 accomplish something you needed
 to be part of a group. 
You mentioned the feelings 
of camaraderie you had at 
Yale
. 
A: Yeah, I Œ I think everybody™s looking fo r 
somebody to  express Œ to be able to sit 

down and talk with, or just relate 
to, especially wh en you™re 25 or 26. 
Q: You mentioned Œ

A: And th-the 
Cimade
 was a very good group from that point of view , and a Œ they 
would meet with them regularly. 
Q: You mentioned coming in to 
one of the camp s, for example
 Gurs
, and talking 
with a student who Œ his name was 
Max
, and he was so appreciative of the fact that 
you took time to talk to him. He was work
ing in the kitchen. So you were aware of 
that, you wrote it down, that every hu
man being needs to be recognized.  
A: Yeah, I think you begin to realize that 
people want to share, and always need  
somebody th ey can open up to, and can talk 
to, and felt that through education there 
was a possibility of helping people realize wh
at they want to do. It becomes a very 
personal thing after a while, looking fo r a warm contact with people.  

Q: You must have established it with your 
students, if you stay
ed on and Œ for 25 
years in one school, and Œ and probabl
y th ere was an exchange there. 
A: Yeah, I still have friends among the stude
nts that I knew. But also realize that a 
lot of the work in education is very tem
porary, and that you don™t Œ I mean, every 
day is not a major day. A lot of days are ve
ry routine an d that you have to get used 
to it. You try and break out of th e routin
e and make a difference in people™s lives. 
Q: Would you like to  add anything? 

A: I appreciate the chance to be here and to
 talk with you about this, cause I felt ri Œ 
was looking over my diary, I realize that 
Œ what extraordinary times they were. And

you mentioned you might even  think of pub
lishing it, well I Œ I have trouble getting 
thoughts down now. I mean, as
 I say, my children want me
 to write memoirs, which 
takes me time to get going on it; my computer
 skills are not too great. So, glad to be 
able to share this with you, and Œ 
Q: We™re very grateful, and the 
Rivesaltes
 Internment Camp Memorial especially is 
very grateful for you havi
ng come all the way from 
Boise
,
 Idaho
, and having made 
the effort to remember some 
of these times that were sometimes painful. And I want 
to thank you from the botto m of my  heart. 

A: Well, thank you very mu ch
. I appreciate being here.
