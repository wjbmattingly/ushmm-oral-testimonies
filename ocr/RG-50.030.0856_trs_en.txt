K arl May

A: He is a Œ a German writer. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And he wrote books about American Indians, though he had never been in

About 
[indecipherable]
 one of the Œ he gl orified American Indian
s. And 
Œ  
Q: So he was translated into Lithuanian? 

A: He was translated into Lithuani an, he was quite popular, and I read the books, I 

remember. Weused to pla y Indians.
 
Q: Did you? Well, it™s interesting, because a whole generati on of people Œ I have 
heard him mentioned before by some of the people I™ve interviewed who are from 
Germany
, and the y would remember 
Karl May
, reading hi m as the y were growing 
up, as well. And we never heard of Œ here in t he 
United States
, it was not part of 

our childhood, not  part of the books that we would remember, you know. Let™s t urn 

a little bit now to your father and your mot her. You say your father was Œ was 

fighting in the 1918 war for independence, i s t hat right?

Q: Your Œ your father™s family?  
A: Yeah, yeah.

A: The y weren™t Œ t he y weren™t marching anywhere, but t he y certainly Œ  

Q: How would you des
c 
Œ you know, when someone sa ys someone is nationalist ic, 
different images come to mind.  

A: What i mages Œ 

Q: How would it express itself? 
A: Oka y. The y liked the fact that there were Lithuanian schools, that their children 
were taught Lithuanian reading and writing, because rem Œ I don™t know if you 

know it, but under the t sar™s occupation, it was forbidden to print books in 

Lithuanian.  

Q: And the y all remembered this, t hen? 

A: I remember the stories about it, I mean Œ  
Q: Yeah.

A: Œ it was before my t ime, but I remember people talking about Œ the stories about 
it, that you had. And we were even t aught it, explained to us that the y used to print 

books in Lithuanian, across the border in 
Prussia
, and smuggle them into 

Lithuania
. And that™s how the y had books, Lithuanian books in their villages. 

Q: I see. 
A: And you could be punished very severely by the tsar™s agents if they found out 
that you had Lithuanian books. But Œ so, there was this feeling t hat now the y cannot 

tell us. We have our own books, our own government. I don™t thi nk anybody was 

too interested in how the government ran, or what was happening. They Œ their li ves 

concentrated on their farm, on their families, on the weat her. 

Q: Cause this Œ it affects the farm. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: That™s it. But, as I say, the y would not  have Œ they would never have welp Œ 

welcomed any foreign country taki ng 
Lithuania
 over.  
Q: Well, some people will call that patriot ic, not necessarily nati onal ist. That 

definition of it, that people find themselves to be patriots of their own country, and 

willing to defend it. 

A: Well, defend it Œ  it™s interesting how it happened, from what I remember.

A: Two. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: I-I in Œ i n 1918, 
Lithuania
 became separat e. The Russian Œ t he tsars were 

defeated. The Œ now I™m talking because I learned about it, not because Œ it was 

much discussed in my fami ly, beca use that was wa y before. 

Q: Got it. 

A: Nobody would sit down and Œ we didn™t have 
TV
 or radios. We did have a radi o. 

Nobody li stened t o it so much, except operas. But what I learned l ater on, after the 
communists took over 
Russia
 government, and then stopped a war, Lithuanians 
declared independence. 
Q: We™re talking 1917 - 1918.

to her friends about it. And Œ someti mes Œ and Œ and that™s how I heard about it. 

Q: Did they argue? 

A: Yes, the y argued. What did the y argue about? Money. I think m y father probably 

had a relationship with somebody, and my mot her just simply did not have much 
respect for my father. 
Q: Ooh. 

A: The y just Œ it j Œ it j ust was not a happy couple. 

Q: Where 
Œ was the at mosphere t hen, much different in your home Œ

your grandmother and uncle™s Œ

A: The y do not abuse each other openly, or in front of us, and was not  much 

arguing. But the y j ust was Œ I thi nk in some ways, m y father loved my mother, but 

he just never measured up to her expectations. 

Q: Now, you described what she thought of him, what di d Œ how would you 

characterize your parents™ personalities?

A: He was Œ 
m y fa
ther was easygoing, I would sa y. And I think h
ereall y loved my 
mother. It™s just that she did not really love hi m, and he could just not measure up to 
what she expected of hi m. 

Q: That™s pretty harsh. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: That™s pretty harsh. 
A: Yeah. So it was not Œ it was not a happy m arriage. And they were both very 

caring, as far as we were concerned, the chil dren. But Œ 

Q: Were you closer to one, or to t he other? 

A: I think as a little girl, I probably leaned more Œ more towards m y mother, but  not 

really, because they were wise enough to never, in front of us, bring their troubles, 

bring their dis-disputes, and try to tell us, oh, he is not good, or she i s not good. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: The y never did t hat. 

Q: Oka y. So it would be what you had overheard, and just the general sense Œ 

A: That™s what I were Œ that™s what I overhear, that he is not ambitious enough, that 

he is not really supporti ng his family the way he should, t hat he is not working hard 

enough. Mostly that was coming from m y mother. I never, ever heard my father 

talking agai nst my mot her, never.

A: Well, m y father was much more open and l oving and fun, where I don™t 

remember my mother playing wit h us much. I mean, she made sure that we looked 

as good as possibl e. When you see that photograph, we are wearing beautiful, red 

velvet outfits, with m y brother. I remember the Œ the y would Œ expected me to do 

well in school, when I started going to school. But I would sa y my mother was not 
very affectionate, whereas my father was. My Œ m y father would not Œ would Œ was 
not much of a disciplinary person, and he was not much of a Œ he was very 
easygoing.

A: And I-I think so, because I would take t hem out whatever I Œ whenever I deci ded 
to go and browse around. So that was m y 
[indecipherabl e]

would ask m y mother t o give me 10 cents, and I would go to the Jewish bakery, and 

buy a sweet. 

Q: Oh. What ki Œ do you had Œ did you have a favorite sweet?  

A: I know exactly what kind of a sweet. It™s a Œ made from what we call now 

gingerbre Œ bread. But it was made in a shape of a mushroom, and it had icing on 
top. And t hat™s what I will get. That was m y sweet. And i t was Œ you know, it was 
very eas

Q: Was in Œ in Œ i n your rented places, did you have runni ng water and electricity, 
and so on? I want t o get a sense of how modern the town was. 

A: There was electricity.  

Q: You had a radio you told me, yes? 

A: We had a radio. There were telephones. There was a train station. 
Q: Did you have telephone in your home? 
A: Yes, mm-
hm.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: There was Œ at least for a while, we did. And we hardly ever but  Œ ever used it. I 

couldn™t call anybody, I think. The farms did not have tel ephones. Post office, 

police office, a-and to me the poli ce seemed t o be Œ chief of police seemed to be 

much bigger shot t han my father. I don™t know why. I t hink maybe t hey lived 
somewhat better than Œ than m y family. I don™t think they had any chi ldren. The 
townspeople basically had their friendships in their own social class. The y had their 

jobs. There were no demonstrations of any kind. 

Q: No poli tical demonstrations. 

A: No. Except on Œ 
on the

A: That there woul d be a parade, m y father would be dressed in his uniform, and 
ma ybe even carry the s-sword. I don™t remember, but it was definitely Œ  the schools 
would be cl osed, and t here would be sp Œ speeches, and very often cold, and 

miserable. 

Q: Yes. 
A: But that was about all. And then, people also were connected to their churches. 
Q: Did your family go to church? Your father and mother?  

A: We went  someti mes. 

Q: Got it. 

A: We were not a very religious family. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Someti mes Œ all the children were baptized. I was prepared to go to communi on, 
first communion, and I remember m y mother had a very pretty whi te dress made for 
me, but no sleeves. Just  little straps, flowers. And Œ but there was no celebration at  

home at all for that. And m y father did not  live with us any more. 

Q: Oh, so did your fa Œ parents sep Œ 

A: My father, at one point, I can™t quite remember, got a job somewhere else. That 

must have been when t he Russians came, or ma ybe even before that . But he moved 

out into an 
ad
-adjoining town, and had a job t here. And he would come and visit us.

But m y mother was basically in charge of the family, and pretty much probably, of 
family finances. So he did go into 
[indeciphera ble]
 some wa y, 
I unders
 Œ 
m y 
understandi ng was. And Œ 

Q: It sounds like a separation. 

A: Yeah, kind of. And then, as far as the town goes, there were no cars. Everybody 
would come and went t here with sl eighs, horses and sleighs. And we kids woul d 
love to run after the sleighs, get hold of the back of the sleigh and go for a ride, 

which was very dangerous, because you could fall down and be trampled by other 

horses, so you had Œ you were not allowed to do it, you had to sneak out to do it. 

And was very safe. I mean, I was never afraid that somebody will steal something 

from me, or beat me up, or what Œ 

Q: Did people talk about political things? Did the y talk about what was go Œ 
A: I am sure that some of them did. Nobody talked in m y family much about 
political thi ngs. 

Q: What was your father™s job at t he Œ when he was border police? What did that  

involve?  

A: That involved, as all  borders have, patrols. At least at t hat time, I™m sure the y do 

now. And he was i n charge of that Œ of a stretch of 
a 
border, in charge of the patrols. 

I guess he would ri de out. He had a beautiful horse, I remember that.

name. And he woul d ri de out there and check on the patrols, I suppose. I think now 
and then, ma ybe every six months, or once a year, some kind of a superiors would 

arrive, and he had pri son documents. I remember it because my mother would fill 

these documents out for him at the last minute, so everything looked oka y. That™s 

what I understood. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: But he didn™t have t o be out there anywhere Œ or every da y, all day, or what. 

Q: Did he have an office? 

A: No, he didn™t have any office. 

Q: Oka y, so there was no place Œ there wasn™t a place he had to go to every day t o 

go to work. 

A: No, no.  
Q: Oka y. 
A: No. 

Q: So before he found a job in another town, he hung around the house? 

A: Mm-hm. Or he was awa y, inspecting the borders.

 doing that?

A: Horses. Someone from the farm would come and pick us up.  

Q: Mm-hm. And t hen bring you there. 

A: That™s t he way they picked us up. When my mother Œ I mean, m y father came to 
Jai malas
(ph), showed up in 
Jaimalas
(ph) because, from what I hear, there were 
rumors that he™s run Œ ran awa y, and he was afraid that the y will Œ

punished, so he showed up. And then there were rumors going on that things are not

things change, and how did things change? That is, here you live i n independent 

Lithuania
. By 1938, you™re already a nine ye ar old girl. And August  7

were born, i n 1938, you™d be nine and August  7
th
, 1939, you™d be 10. And in late 
August of ™39 is when 
Hitler
 and 
Stalin
 signed the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop 
Pact.
 
A: Right, right, ri ght. 
Q: And I™m sure that nobody Œ but I™m leading you here, ma ybe it™s t rue that people 

did know about it, but from what I have heard, most people didn™t know about t his 
pact that the y had si gned. 
A: I have no idea because, as I sa y, we di d not discuss family Œ in my family, 

politics or Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ I think in Œ in Œ I Œ I™m sure that some people who followed, knew about that, 

but we did not list en to the radio. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: We had no information, and I never heard about anything. I just knew that the 
Russians t ook over 
Lithuania
, and that our President 
Smetona
 ran away. And t here 

was some kind of Œ some gossip going around, no fight, nothing, he just left. Which 

was a disgrace. 

Q: Oka y. So Œ 

A: There Œ there were even some Œ some little songs 
[indecipherable]
 made about 
Smetona
 
running awa y.

Q: Do you remember any of them? 
A: No, I don™t remember that. I remember another one, but I don™t remember that 

one. I remember about both German and R ussian Œ 

Q: Tell me. 

A: 
[speaks Lithuanian] 
Q: One is ye Œ black as the devil. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: One is red like a dog. I don™t need any 
Berlin

Moscow

right?  

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. So that was something t hat was Œ  

A: That was already when the Germans came in. 
Q: I see. Oka y Œ 
A: But first we have to deal with t he Russians. So what I heard about Russian 

occupation, I had not Œ in 
Jai malas
(ph), I haven™t seen any police, or Œ 
I mean, 

soldiers coming in, or anyt hing. The library was running l ike it di d before, no 

change. 

Q: What about school? 

A: Huh?  

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis

Q: What about school? 
A: School s were runni ng, however the y brought in an organization called 

[indecipherable]
 pioneers. 

Q: Oka y. So the Œ did your teachers change? Did new teachers come in? 

A: No, the same teachers. And I think there could have been classes about 
communism, and how the common man was Œ there wer
e 
Œ there were probably 
some peopl e in town who liked the idea that it was Œ everybody™s goi ng to be equal 
t ype of a thing, but  I don™t know. I do know that the farmers were very concerned, 

because the y were required by the gub Œ by the government now, to deliver so much 

food, grains of all kinds, ma ybe even animals to their government . For which they 

got paid, but very little. So slowly Œ you know, depending how much l and you had, 

it looked li ke slowly you will have to sell i t Œ t o leave it, because 
you wi
ll not able 
to Œ to have enough to deliver to t he government. And after that, t hey would start 

building 
kolhauses
(ph). 
Kolhauses
(ph) i s a farm that the land belongs to the state, 

and everybody works there, for the state. So t hat was goi ng along, and Œ but 
as far 

as m y life, or I would say, my mother™s life, di d not change. She still worked in t he 

library. I sti ll went to school. 

Q: Your father still  did his job? 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis

53
 
A: My father just was nowhere to be seen. He ha Œ I don™t even know if he had a 
job of any sort. 

Q: He just wasn™t there. 

A: He wasn™t there. I do remember that once he showed up to Œ j ust t o make sure 

that everybody saw hi m, that he was still  alive, and there, and Œ and then di Œ 
disappeared again. And then just before the deport Œ huge deportation was staged, 
he came home, and I have a feeling that the people knew, or sensed, or heard 

something, that something is going to happen. So, my father or my m other, I™m not 

sure who, got in touch with m y Œ m y uncles, and they came, and they picked us 

three up.  

Q: The chil dren. 

A: All the children, all three of us. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And took us out int o the farm. And Œ 

Q: Oka y, before we get  there though, before we get there, when the occupation 

happens Œ 

A: Uh-huh.

Q: Œ it comes in stages. August ™39, right after your birthda y, is when the pact is 
signed. Later on in the fall, the first Soviet troops are stationed in 
Lithuania
. That 

might be going in different places, not in 
Jaimalas
(ph). 

A: That™s going on somewhere Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ but it™s just never regi Œ 
as far
 as I™m concerned, a chil d in that smal l town, I 
did not hear people talking much about it, or you know, the change Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ from one to another. It seemed to me that  people just  Œ I just knew Œ what I 

knew of it was that 
Smetona
, the president left, and that now I Œ it™s t he Russian 
government . 

Q: Oka y. 
A: The Œ the communist Œ 
Q: Government. 

A: Œ are here.

Q: But different things happened, and I want t o find out Œ as I™m sa ying these 
things, I™m wanting to find out if any of this triggers anyt hing for 
Jaimalas
(ph). 

And that is Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Œ after the Œ the army has its soldiers based, then Œ then you tal ked about the 
requisitioning, and the taxes that t he farmers had to pa y. 
A: I don™t even remem ber seeing any arm y. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: In 
Jai malas
(ph). 

Q: Was there a change in the police chief, a change in the mayor Œ 

A: I don™t Œ I Œ I Œ there must have been. 

Q: Was there anybody who lost t heir business, let™s say a l ittle store, or that it no 
longer ran Œ  
A: Not that  I knew of. 

Q: O
k a y.
 
A: Not that I knew of. I don™t think the y had market da ys any more.

Q: Do you remember t he following summer? Not even a year had gone by, but I 

think it was June or July, the new communist government  voted t o be included in 

the

. 
A: No. 

Q: So none of that was something Œ  

A: No. 
Q: Œ that affected you in

A: If somet hing happened, happened, but it was just Œ

A: And nobody in m y fami ly read any of them. And there no changes in town, as 
such. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So for us, no matter who sat there in the na Œ 

Q: 
[indeci pherable]
 di fference. 
A: Œ in Œ i n Œ yes. There was Œ there was a pat riotic feeling that, you know, the y 

went that Œ bu-but that was straight from t he beginning, I think. It was right from 

the beginning, as soon as 
Smetona
 left. 

Q: What was the patriotic feeling? 

A: Wat 
Œ independence. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Don™t Œ  do not want  the Russians here, or anybody. Want to be independent. 
And Œ and people felt sad there was na Œ it Œ it  was as far Œ what I have heard 

talking, and what m y mother talked about , at  Œ we™re unhappy that i t Œ 
Lithuania
 

was no longer independent.

A: The Œ actually, you know, the communists, there must have been some 
communists in town, as there were communists everywhere at that p Œ ti me in 

Lithuania
, and they probably were ha-happy, but there were no flag raisings, or big 

parades, or you know, hurray, we are now part of
 Soviet Union
 or not, it Œ none of 
them happened. None of it. 
Q: So here you are, just  over a year and a half later, you know, August Œ 
I mean, 
excuse me, September 30,or 
Œ the fall of ™39 is when the troops are st age, July of 
1940 is when there™s the annexation into the 
Soviet Union
, and almost a full year 

before this time that  you™re talking about, of people feeling like something™s goi ng 

to happen. And your uncles come Œ I™m just putting a date to this Œ your uncles 
come and take you Œ 
A: The y come Œ it was just before the deportat ions started. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: That™s when I-I-
I mean 
Œ I personally, nobody told me anything about it. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And did not discuss anything, or talked in front of me about it. But I was told 

later on that  m y family felt something is going to happen, that something Œ and that 

other people felt Œ knew that something is going to happen, so m y mother decided 

to send us out.

A: And she did not want to go herself, because she did not want to leave the

did not sleep at home any more. 

Q: Really? And why would she be frightened t hat she shou Œ she coul dn™t sleep at

Q: Oka y, so even t hough life really hadn't changed much Œ  
A: No. Yeah. 

Q: Œ and things went on, there was a sense of Œ of insecurity. 

A: Now, because the y also felt that the war will be coming. There were rumors 

about the war comi ng. I believe there were al so rumors t hat Œ I mean, the Russians, 
or the Œ the Soviets started demanding more and more from the farmers. They 
probably demanded somet hing from the stores Œ store owners, or other people. It 

just Œ obviously that the population was feeling uneasy.

Q: Do you remember l eaving

hat do you remember from that? 
A: Leaving? The y cam e from the farm wit h the horse and buggy, and a cart, and 

just said you are going Œ you know, m y mother said, you are going to go to the 
farms. Which was not so unusual for us because we went every summ er Œ 

practically every summer there anyway. 

Q: And thi s was Œ  

A: So we did. 

Q: Yeah, so this was li ke in late Ma y, early June, something Œ 
A: June.

A: The week later, t he war started, yes. So we were taken out to t he farms, and I ha 

Œ so the Œ I think t he population felt that some Œ there were rumors, there were

will be pushed out , an-and the Germans wi ll come and push the germ Œ the Soviets 

out, and everybody felt ve Œ I think most people probably felt oh well, that™s good.

Let™s get rid of the Soviets. At least the Germans are religi ous. So that was it. So 
when the y t ook us to the farm, I did not thi nk anything of it. Now, I tell you the one 

thing. Once I Œ once we got there, after stayi ng with m y uncles for about a week, w
e 

were taken awa y from m y uncles, our uncles distributed the three of us to different 

farmers around. 
Q: Family members, or not? 
A: No, not even family members. I don™t know where m y brother was, or my sister. 

I know that  I was with some peopl e who I could have met , but the y were not family 
members, and I just stayed there, and I did not  know why. I thought maybe because 

the war was coming, because at one point, the family had even a Œ a kind of earth 

tunnel buil t, or somethi ng, that you could go i n, if the bombs start falling, if they 

start shooti ng around. 
Q: Do you remember anyt hing about this fami ly t hat you were with?  
A: No, don™t remember. I don™t even remember their name. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But, you know, they were kind t o me, they were good to me. They did not Œ 
th ey 

did not tell  me what was going on, the y j ust said, you know, m y brother was 

somewhere else. I wanted to be with my brother and sister, mainly m y brother. 

Q: Yeah.

A: And I Œ  I-I just didn™t.  
Q: So that was the one unusual thi ng. It was not unusual that you would go with 

your uncles to the farms, but it was unusual that you™d be split up. 

A: That we were taken from m y uncles, to the different farms. 

Q: So Œ 
A: And then, at one point, when the Germans came, we were taken to another farm, 
another uncle. And finall y, we were Œ all three of us got to gi Œ t ogether again.  

Q: Do you ni Œ remember about how long a ti me span that was? 

A: No. I Œ I mean, i t Œ i t Œ the same summer.  

Q: The same summer. 

A: Yeah, in a few weeks, probably. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Or at the most, a month. 
Q: Oka y. That™s Œ

What happened wit h them? 

A: Wherever m y father was, from what I understand he had joined a Lithuanian 

partisans, and fought the Russians leaving 
Lithuania
. Chased them 
Œ  helped them 
chase them out. My mother was deported. That™s why we were Œ t hat™s why the y 
thought that something was going on, goi ng to happen, 
andthat™s why the y 
Œ we 
were sent to the farms. We were Œ and after she was deported, we were sent to 
different farmers. And then, after Russians left, and the Germans cam e, they found 

my fam
il Œ  m y uncles found out t hat my mother was deported. And how I found out 
Œ 

Q: Tell me. 

A: Œ 
m y 
Œ m y aunt, and my godmunt Œ godmother, my father™s oldest sister,
 
Ona
(ph), we were going to some adjacent farm, where I ha Œ I had l eft something 
there, or some Œ for some reason we were wal king. We were walki ng little paths 

through their farmland, and someone was working on the land. I don™t know, my 

aunt knew him, and they start to talk, and t he y start to talk and the man said, I hear 

that

because my baby was sick, and I couldn™t sta y out there. I had to go then Œ 
to m y 
Œ 
to the apartment. So, this is what my sist ers tol d me, she said, when she got off Œ 

out of the plane, we somehow, all of us recognized her. B ut we al so knew that once 

she was able to fl y out of 
Russia
, and fl y to 
Switzerland
, that when she got to 

Switzerland
, we knew she was safe. So that™s Œ what she told about t he camps, she 
said actually, first she was kept in prison, and was interrogated, and was badly 
beaten up, and the y wanted to get names of other partisans, partisans that were 

involved. Andshe said shedi
dn™t t ell them anything. So she then ended in camps 

way out the 
Altai
 mountains. And it was very difficult. She had had, at one point, 

some training as a nurse. So for a while, she actually helped out in one camp, as a 

nurse, and she caught 
TB
. She al most died. And then the y Œ they worked in the 
fields, and she said somet i mes the peasant s from the area would l eave packages of 
food in the fields for them, for the prisoners, because they knew the y were starving. 
She said by that time, a cat appeared in the camp. We knew that we lived much 

better, because nobody ate the cat. 

Q: I can™t imagine what that must have been li ke, for you, for her. 

A: Hm?  

Q: I said, I can™t imagi ne what that must have been like Œ

about her family. And t hen she served 15 years, as she was required apparently, her 
punishment was t o serve 15 years, so she did. And then they said, the authorities 
told her that she can stay if she wants to, and work as an Œ a nurse, or so Œ and t he y 

will pay her. But she said no, she wanted to go back home. And so she Œ she went 

back ho Œ back to 
Lithuania
. 
Q: So that Œ if she w Œ was there for 15 years, that means it woul d have been 1956 

that she would have been released from her servitude. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And Œ and went  back to 
Lithuania
 in the mi d-50s, or right after t hat.

A: No, nothing. 

Q: So, was it like getting a stranger Œ  

A: A complete stranger, mm-
hm. An
d very unhappy woman. Very unhappy 

woman. No matter what you did for her, and how it went, nothing really pleased 
her. 
Q: Do you recognize any of that from growing up, or was the mother you knew, as 

hard as she was, not like that? 

A: No, no, I don™t, I don™t remember that. I don™t remember that. I knew that she 

was ni Œ not a happy women when she Œ when I was growing up, but partly was Œ 

that was sort of that she and Father did not get along. But no, you know, I really 

don™t remember m y m other laughi ng, smile, or really meeting anybody with great 
joy. It just Œ 
there was 
something in her character that Œ of course the deportation, 
and the Œ the arrests and all that, were difficult, but some of that inner sadness was 

alwa ys there, and I don™t know what for. Now m y father was very different. 

Q: I don™t know what Œ 

A: So she Œ she died in 
Kansas
, where in she Œ m y brother called me, it was right at 

New Year™s, I don™t  remember how many years ago, but he called me and he said 

that Mother had to go i nto the hospital. And I called her and talked with her in t he 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis

hospital, and she said, oh, I am feeling Œ I don™t feel bad. So that was oka y. There is 
somebody here who can speak Œ her English was not good, not very good, but she 

says somebody here can speak Polish. And she knew Pol ish, and of course she 

knew Russian. And so she said was very good. And she died next  da y. 

Q: How many years di d she event ually live here in the 
United States
? 
A: Ma ybe 10, I thi nk. She was 80 when she died, I know that. 

Q: Do you remember her birth date? 

A: No.

A: I flew out to 
Kansas

mother is dead, the y are both Œ and m y brother is dead, and all three of them are 

buried in

A: Very good resti ng place, very quiet. Very good resting place, yeah. 

Q: Well,it also 
Œ it  sounds like when you went awa y in that wagon with your

Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
74
 
Q: Yeah. Thank you for sharing this. I thi nk we™ll take a break now. 
[brea k] 
 
All right. So, before the break, we were talki ng about what had happened your Œ 
with your mother, what her destiny was, and one thing that I want ed to see if we 

could bring some clarity t o, woul d have been, what was t he reason for her 

deportation? Why woul d she have been taken? Can you supply any explanation for 
that?  
A: I do not  have any specific informations. What I heard people talki ng about, that 

there were more people Œ she was not the only one from the town that was taken, 

there were more people taken from that town. I think the ma yor of the town, and his 

family. And i-if it Œ it™s strange Œ strange coincidence, one of the daughters, small  

daughter of that family, was staying with her grandparents in the village, and she 

was left. 
Q: I see. 
A: So everybody was t aken in the family, but her. And she grew up and actually 

came to 
United States
. And from the people t here was a feeling that they were 

trying to pick up better educated people, and probably people that mi ght have been 

a problem. I had never heard anythi ng said that m y mother woul d have been picked 

up because of my father. I haven™t heard that at all. 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
75
 
Q: Why would she then, have been picked up? If not because of your father, what 
would be the Œ 
the reason?
 

A: But I think it™s nobody was given any reason. The y just showed up and said you 

are going, period. That is m y understandi ng. There were all these people, the y™re 

taken from Œ from this town, and it was a massive deportation all across the 
country. People were taken from other cities, t oo, and shi pped straight out to Œ to Œ 
to 
Soviet Union
. And much later on, one of m y uncles and his fami ly were 

deported. That was during the 40s. 

Q: After the war? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yes
. Whenthe Russiansstayed in 
Lithua ni a
. 
Q:Oka y. Sothere was no 
Œ your mother had a feeling Œ 
A: There was no Œ there was no specific charge. It was not like somebody showed 

up and said oka y, you™ve wrote thi s pamphlet, or your bel ong to this group, and 

that™s why you wil l have to go. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y Œ from what happened to m y mother probably happened to very many 

people. Very often I heard those st ories that they separated small chil dren from their 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
76
 
parents, and some of these very tiny children were given awa y to Russian families 
to raise. 

Q: Oh really? 

A: I don™t know if that is true. I really don™t know. And as far as I was concerned, 

the wa y I found out , I t old you how I found out about it, nobody ever explained to 
me why she was taken. He just said there were a pla Œ 
many other peopletaken.
 
Q: Do you remember mi ssing her? 
A: Oh, I miss her terribly. The Œ 
everyb o dy 
Œ 
I 
mean, my sister was ti ny still, she 
was seven years Œ she™s seven years younger. So my sister, she said that Œ she told 

me much later, now act ually, that for a long ti me she thought maybe she did 

something, that™s why the mother was gone. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And it™s just one of these things that happened. And, in a strange way though, 
now of course, I would question i t Œ if anything that Œ like that would happen, or 

si milar, I would be questioning everywhere. But at that ti me I was small, the war 

was going on, and nobody Œ and never asked any questions. I never asked any 

questions, andnobody explainedt o me.
 
Q: So, your Œ at t hat Œ even up unt il the ti me your mother was taken, you had never 

seen any Soviet soldiers? 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
77
 
A: No. 
Q: No. But soon after t hat, there was a German attack, a Nazi attack on the 
Soviet 

Union
, and now 
Lithuania
 was a part of the 
Soviet Union
. How did that Œ how did 
you ex 
Œ do you remember that happening?  

A: I was then not staying with m y fa Œ with any of m y family. We were separated, 
the three chi ldren, and I was staying with some other people. And then eventually 
heard that the Russians left, and the Germans came, and as far as I was concerned, 

and the people around me were glad to see Germans, because the Russians were 

beginning to confiscate the farms, and impose all kinds of restricti ons like that. And 

the ti mes i n the country became more difficult. So they thought well, occupation Œ 

at least some of them would say, well, at least the y believe in God. 

Q: I see. I see. 
A: So. 
Q: You remember hearing that? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Di Œ

A: No. No. 
Q: Cause it™s quite dist ance Œ I mean, it™s quite far across the count ry. 

A: Yes, yes. And he was not working at Œ  wel l, in my mind, I assumed that we have 

a Lithuanian government now. 

Q: That was your assumption at t he time?  
A: Yes. That the Russi ans have left. And so the Germans were there, but then Œ in 
the country, but the y were there to kind of protect us from Russi ans. And I Œ if I 

don™t re Œ I don™t remember why, but I do think there was some quasi-Lithuanian 

government . How real, how unreal, or am I imagining it, I don™t remember. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I remember my school that I li ked. The chi ldren were friendly. I also remember 

that there was a Œ a Polish population in town. 
Q: Uh-huh. And was this somethi ng new for you? 
A: That was something new to me. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But there was a Poli sh population in school also, and at  one point, I think there 

were classes in school, were given i n Polish. 

Q: Did you ever go to any of those classes? 

A: No.

Q: No. 
A: The y were Œ the y were discontinued. Everyt hing was in Lithuanian. What ha Œ 

say 
Œ what Œ if you know Lithuanian history, t hat part of 
Lithuania
, 
Vilnius
 and all 
around there, at one point it was i n Polish hands. After 1918, the Pol es, the y Œ 
t h e y 

were there, and the Lithuanians could not  get the land back. So only when the Œ first 
the Russians, the communists came to 
Lithuania
, they brought this country, these 
parts of 
Lithuani a
, back to the Lit huanian Republic then. And the Germans also 

had it all in the Lit huanian Republic. Actually, when m y father was working in 

−v en

, we have gone to 
Vilnius
, excuse me, to visit with some priest that m y 
sis Œ m y aunt knew.  

Q: Mm-hm. Was that t he first time you were in 
Vilnius
 ever?  
A: Yes. 
Q: And do you remember any i mpressions from that visi t?  
A: Churches, basically. 

Q: There are a lot of churches there. 

A: Yes. And knowing my aunt, yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: We went to churches.

Q: Oka y. So Œ so withi n a number of months, actually one could sa y rather quickly, 
your life really turns upside-down, but then gets resettled halfway across th
e 

country. 

A: You know, in Œ agai n, if I think about it now, it™s very unsettl ing. However, I 

was small, I was st ill very young, and I wasn™t the only one who was being resett led 
everywhere, up and down. It was Œ the whole country was being resettled up Œ up 
and down. There Œ t here was no Œ it was not unusual to have to move, and start 

somewhere else, and I really didn™t have a place, some 
[i ndecipherable]
. 
My 
mother was taken, so i n 
Jaimalas
(ph) there was nothing for me, anybody else. And 

Œ well, the farms, my uncles™ farms were oka y, but I had t o go to school, so I will 

not have sta yed in t he village anywa y. And I had never been there in winter, so Œ so 

moving to another city, and a Œ 
anothertown, andanother apart ment wasn™t 
something that was dra-dramatic for a Œ that si  Œ the Œ the har Œ hurtful thing was 
that m y motherwasn™t there.
 
Q: You mi ssed her. 
A: That was difficult. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And though I l iked m y aunt, I never Œ somehow I Œ in m y sil ly, lit tle mind, I Œ I 

felt that m y mother was more worldly, more sophisticated.

Q: Was she, in actualit y? 
A:Yes, yes, yes.
 

Q: So Œ 

A: That m y aunt was this very religious, count ry woman, and though she was ki nd 

enough Œ she was a good woman.  
Q: Yes, but she wasn™t your mother. 
A: Yeah. I was Œ somehow I Œ I had 
warmer memoriesof mygrandmother. We 

reallyliked my gra 
Œ were very close to m y grandmother. 

Q: Yeah. Your father would Œ di d he have an office that he went t o? 

A: No. Yes, he had an office.  

Q: He had an office. Did you ever visit hi m there? 

A: No. I ne ver went there. I never went there, I never saw any Germans around, 
soldiers. I Œ I Œ we knew very few people i n town. Actually, when I t hink of it, I 
don™t remember see anybody that we knew, except people through 

[indecipherable]
 from my aunt, that in Œ at the church. And I remem ber that the 

priest tha-that parish priest would give huge, very elaborate Easter breakfast at that 

parish, and invite some people. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And I went to church a great deal , and was involved with the church ceremonies.

Q: Did you get communion, first communion? Oh, that was before already. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you get confirmed? 

A: Yes, in 
Vilnius
. 
Q: In
 Vilnius
, you got confirmation in 
Vil nius
. 
A: Mm-
hm, mm
-
hm, mm
-
hm.
 
Q: Oka y. Now, was the Œ in some wa ys what you™re descri bing to me sounds not 
unusual, because up until the Œ those changes, in 1939, to 1941, this was 
Poland
, 
this was not 
Lithuania
.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: So it was a new ni Œ  it was new territory for a Lithuani an admi nist ration. Were 

there other Lithuanians in 
 
, or was Œ 
werethe y a minority?
 
A: Everybody spoke Li thuanian. We Œ if you went to the store, or if you went t o a 

restaurant, which we somet imes di d, everybody spoke Lit huanian. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And whoever Œ in school, whoever was in school with me, spoke Lithuanian. 

Q: Now, you said though that you did know that there were Polish children in your 

school, and for a little while there were classes in Polish. 

A: Not after we came.

Q: Oh, I see. 
A: Before. 

Q: Before. 

A: Before we came, t hey spoke Œ they had Polish, but when we came there, when 

the Lithuanians had hold of these parts, and then the school was only Lithuanian. 
Q: Did Polish chi ldren, however, attend it? 
A: I don™t know if they were Polish or not . They all spoke Lithuanian. 

Q: I see. 

A: I did not meet anybod y in school that spoke Polish. 

Q: I see. One of the reasons I ask is because in 
Poland
 i tself, German Œ during 

German occupation, education was severely restricted for Poles. Severel y. In some 

ways, outri de forbidden. 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: And some places, onl y up unti l certain grades. So maybe children went to school 

who were Œ  Polish chil dren went to school, and were able t o continue school, but 

only if they did it i n Lithuanian. 

A: Probably, because t he por Œ as far Œ from what I know, our education was not 

restricted in any wa y. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
91
 
A: But then, again, there was this Œ Germans, from talks around, had something 
against the Slavs. And Poles were Slavs, and t he Lithuani ans were not. So I think 

we might have gotten some preferential treat m ent. 

Q: I see. 

A: It™s possible. Again, I just heard it as hi  Œ as gossips, someti mes, a-among some 
ad
-adults. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: But when we came there, didn™t know anybody. 

Q: Oka y. Now Œ 

A: And we just moved into the apart ment. I was taking pi ano lessons. 

Q: From whom? 

A: I do know that as ti me went on, things became more difficult. For example, food 
became scarce. You could not get  meat, or you got very l ittle meat. But we had 
rabbits, we kept rabbits, and hens, and I thi nk even geese. And a Œ I ne Œ I don™t 

remember ever going t o the store t o shop. Whatever was bought, m y Aunt 
Oda
(ph) 
probably went and shopped. 

Q: So in some wa ys it sounds like you were quite sheltered, you know, as children. 

A: Yeah.

92
 
Q: You didn™t Œ it  was Œ would that be true, that you were kind of sheltered from 
the chores of everyday Œ 

A: Yes. I never was asked to do anything. I did not have t o make beds, I did not 

have to Œ to help in the kitchen. 

Q: And you were the oldest, so Œ 
A: And I was the oldest, yes. No.  
Q: Was your father still  as easygoing as he had been before? 

A: There were times when he would disappear for a couple da ys or so. There were 

times that he woul d be drunk. 

Q: Oh really? Had you ever seen hi m drunk before? 

A: No. There were tim es Œ well, if he was drunk, he was loud, he tal ked loud. He 

never talked politics of any sort. 
Q: Did you Œ did his manner change, to you, or to the others? 
A: Towards us? No. No. 

Q: Did he Œ 

A: He was alwa ys very gentle wit h us, and in some wa ys I felt he was unusually 

proud of me, because he thought I was very smart, and he thought that to the very 

end of his life, which is interesting. 

Q: It™s important for a child. 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: It™s very i mport ant for a child to feel that from their parent. 

A: So to Œ  
Rita
, 
m y sister
 Œ
 
Gerda
(ph) my sister was considered very pretty. I was 
definitely the smart one. 

Q: I see. 
A: And there wasn™t much shoppi ng of any kind. I think whatever cl othes we had, 
they were made over, changed. But Œ 

Q: Did you make any new friends in 

? 
A: I did. I had Œ 
especi ally one 
Œ one girl who lived out of town, and she would 
someti mes after school  come to my house and sta y with me, and we would play. 

Q: And she was somebody you had met from school? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Do you remember her name? 
A: I don™t remember her name. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That was also j ust for a short while. When I think of it now, and knowing the 

history of my father there, I can see t hat some people probably were avoiding us. I 

mean, that™s what I read into it now. At t hat ti me, I had no idea. We were in a place 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015

where I was not familiar. I did not know the pl ace, I did not know the people, I was 
in a new school. I did pretty well in school . 

Q: Well, you menti oned knowing now about Œ about the Œ  such things. When di d 
you find out, and what did you find out? 

A: 
Rita™s
 book. 
Q: So, your daughter recently wrote a book. 
A: Yes. 

Q: That was published less than three Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ months ago Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ in September 2015. 
A: 
Yeah, yes
. 
Q: And before then, what had you known about your father™s work? We™ll talk 

about what you learned, but I want  to find out what you knew. 

A: Yeah, what I knew about hi m. Oka y, there Œ let™s see, how long a time was it 

that the Germans were there, and then the Russians came back? 

Q: I think i t was from ™41 to ™44. 

A: Three years.

Q: At least
, mm
-
hm
. 
A: Three years. Oka y, so when Œ at one point, I remember that my father was Œ l et™s 
see 
Œ yes. We left 

, and moved to Œ where did it Œ 
Kupishkis
. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Because m y father was arrested. I was on the farms. I and m y brother were on 
the farms with our uncl es, and my grandmother was in the apart ment in 
 
, and m y uncles went and picked her up. I think also i n that period, that 

summer, at one point, before our uncles, before I went to our farms, we were taken 

out of town. Now who took us, I don™t remember. And we were pl aced somewhere 

in a very wooded place, somewhere in the woods, by some family, for a few weeks 

or a month or so. I™m not sure how long. But t hen we all come together Œ 
I™m 

talking chil dren Œ and we all left for m y uncles™ farms. And then, whi le there, at the 
end of the summer, time came to go to school, and my uncles rent ed an apart ment  
for my aunt  and the three of us in 
Kupishkis
, so that we could go to school. 
Q: So it was anot her new school? 

A: That was another new school. And I haven™t lived in 
Kupishkis
 before. I didn™t 
even Œ 
was not 
[indecipherable]
. So I went to school there, and when I were Œ were 
Œ when we were in 
Kupishkis
, we heard that m y father was in prison. No, we Œ 
before we came to 
K upishkis
, we were still at my uncles™ farms, we heard that m y

father was arrested. He was in pri son in 
Vilnius
. And so my uncles found out about 
it. How, I don™t know. I remember thinking that it was so unfair. The Russians took 
m y mo
ther, and the Germans put my father in jail. And t he school started, we 
moved to shi Œ to 
Kupishkis
, and there was a break in the fall, there was some kind 
of a holiday, and m y aunt was ready to go to 
Vilnius
, vi sit her father, and I was 
going to go with her. And just before we left, we received i nformat ion that he was 
released. 

Q: I see. So Œ 

A: So he was released, he came to 
Kupishkis 
t o see us, and then went  to 
Panev
¡
, where he was employed agai n. 
Q: So he never went back to 

? 

A: No. 
Q: I see. 
A: Never went Œ 

Q: And do you Œ 

A: Œ back t o 

. 

Q: Œ 
do youremember what month 
Œ 
oh, what time 
Œ what year it was that he was 
arrested?

A: The only wa y Œ I think after two Œ 
we mu 
Œ  I must have spent two years in a 
school in 
 
. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And it would have happened in t he summer bef Œ after that. 

Q: So it would be the summer of ™43? 
A: Probably, yeah. 
Q: Oka y. Now, when you moved t o 

,  yo
u mentioned that there was Œ it 
eh Œ first of all, it was part of 
Poland
.There were many Polish people.
 

A: I did not really even know that. 

Q: I know, I know. 

A: Yeah. I j ust knew that there were Poles l iving there. 

Q: Did you see Œ 
A: And I know from the history Œ by then I knew that there Œ because I le-learned 
some history and geography, that 
Vilnius
, and the part around 
Vilnius
, after 1918 
was left for the Poles. But as soon as the first communist occupat ion took place, that 

part of 
Lithuani a
 was put back to 
Lithuania
. 
Q: So some could sa y that was something that was advantageous Œ 

A: Yes 
[indecipherable]
 Œ 

Q: Œ for

A: Œ advant ageous, you know. Yes, everybody Œ Lithuanians felt good. We have 
our land back. 

Q: Mm-hm. I see. Now, from what  I understand about 
 
, it had not only a 
Polish population, but also a Jewish population before the war. When you went 

there, when you lived t here, do you remember any Jewish shops, do you remember 
any Jewish people? Do you remember seei ng anything on the streets, anybody on 
the streets?  

A: No. And if Œ I mean, if they Œ unless they were dressed differently, or went t o s Œ 

if they Œ I don™t remember seeing a synagogue. I did not remember hearing any 

Jews in the stores. Just on di Œ didn™t see any Jews. No Œ no Jews ever came to our 

house, and I don™t remember seeing any Jewish children in school. But then t hat™s 

not surprising because when I was in Œ in 
−v en

, I did not know if there 
were any Jewish children in my school. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y would not necessarily would have announced themselves as Jewish, or try 

to stand out. 

Q: Did you Œ did you, as children, know what  was happening to the Jews of the 

country? 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
99
 
A: No. No. I don™t  know, it might have been discussed among m y Œ m y family, like 
m y unclesand m y au 
Œ  m y grandmother, or even my aunt who lived with us. B ut 
they never tried to tell us anything about it Œ about the fate of the Jews, or did we 

ask?  Now, why di dn™t we ask? Perhaps we were scared. 

Q: Why would you be scared? 
A: If people are being arrested, you are scared. If you are small, and people are 
being arrested, especial l y if they were people that you knew Œ though I did not 

know any Jews Œ I knew Jews in Œ in 
Jai malas
(ph), as st ore owners. But in 

 
, when we moved int o 
 
, I did not  meet any Jews. And I Œ I 
mean, I know what happened, but by the Œ when we arrived there, I would now 

think that by then the Jews must have been rounded up and moved out of town. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Because I know that Germans required t hat they wear Œ wore a yellow star. Now 
where did I find that out? Was it there, or much later? Probably st ill i n
 Lithuania
, 

but I never saw anybody wearing it .  

Q: Did you ever see somebody wearing ri bbons? 

A: A what?  

Q: Ribbon s of some ki nd. 

A: No.

Q: No. 
A: No. 

Q: That would mark them as Jewi sh? No. 

A: No. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: I really don™t thi nk I met any Jews there, or knew what ha Œ was happening to 
the Jews. 

Q: Would you have ever thought at that ti me t hat your father might have had 

something to do with it? 

A: No. I had Œ 
m y 
Œ thi s is Œ sounds very stupid, but I had no i Œ not really knew 
what m y father™s job involved. 

Q: That™s not stupid, you were a child. 
A: It™s Œ yeah, well, it was security police, or Œ there were plenty of reasons to Œ  to 
want to be secure. I do remember an incident, because it was so talked about that, 
very much, at that ti me. That there was a Œ an incident where a Germ an Œ two 

Germans were in car, driving 
somewhere, not to
o far from 
 
 somewhere. 
And the y had a translator, a woman. I assume she was a Lithuanian woman. And 

she was connected wit h the partisans. We knew there were partisans in the woods. 

And she asked the Germans to st op the car because she needed to go to the woods 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
101
 
to relieve herself. The y stopped the car, and the partisans shot them. And then she 
was arrested. The Germans picked her up, and I remember that there was Œ that 

there were some Germ an nat Œ 
Wehrmacht
, with the brown shi rts, had appeared in 
town, ka Œ even were i n our house, talking to Œ to my father, and I remember m y 
father making a remark to somebody that she would be better off dead. And I 
remember then heari ng something that people were Œ were shocked because of this. 
I remember t hat the y picked ma ybe that inci dent, or some other i ncident, the 

Germans picked up some Œ a couple men t hat  Œ the y were not Jews, I think the y 

were Poles, ma ybe Lithuanians, and shot t hem on Œ the y t ook them to Jewish 

cemetery and shot them t here, though they were not Jewish. And I remember I was 

v ery 
Œ I was afraid. But then I don™t know where the y were buried, or not buried, or 

what Œ or what they were shot for, but I was afraid. And t hen the Germans kind of 
disappeared again. There was not Œ I did not feel a strong German presence in thi s Œ 
in 
 
, because if you wal ked to school, if you walked to town, you didn™t 
see them. 

Q: Now, did you feel safe? 

A: Huh?  

Q: Did you feel safe? Given what you™re describing to me, that doesn™t sound Œ  

A: No.

102
 
Q: Œ like an easy thing to answer. 
A: No. You didn™t . When this Œ things Œ things go like that, you don™t feel safe. You 

don™t feel safe anywhere. So there were times i n m y very young life, where I was Œ 

I mean, just  the fact that m y father was then arrested Œ 

Q: Did you ever find out what for? 
A: No. One did not ask. I mean, these things were Œ people were arrested. So, t he 
government , whoever they are at that point, has something against you, so they 

arrested you. Why? Who knows? The whole system of justice was non-existent. It 

was on on the whi m of the government that  was, at that ti me, in power. That™s it. 

The y did not have t o gi ve any excuses or explanations. You could have been picked 

up walking down t he st reet, and hauled off. 

Q: Mm-hm. So Œ 
A: Because it happened. Look, when m y mot her was taken awa y, there were 
thousands of people taken awa y. So Œ 

Q: So it wouldn™t  have occurred to ask why. Is that what you™re sa yi ng? 

A: No. Didn™t even occur to ask me why. 

Q: Oka y. Well, now Œ 

A: You know what? And also then, whatever was happening to t he Jews at that 

time, had I even known about it, that they were being arrested and hauled off, it

would be just anot her t hing happening. C an you Œ another crazy t hing happening. 
Scary. It™s a very hard life. Very difficult time. It™s interest ing when I think about it, 

heck, here I am. Wonder of wonders. I don™t even lock m y door. I did for a long 

time, in m y life. I did not feel safe. And then, you know, then we Œ we were in 
DP
 
camps. 
Q: We™ll tal k about this. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But I want to Œ I want to still sta y wit h this 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Sta y wi th th Œ with t his Œ with this period i n our life.  

Q: Yeah. Now, at this point, I™ll i nterject t his Œ how it even is that we come to speak 

with you t oda y. And that™s by mentioning the book that your daughter wrote, your 

daughter 
Rita Gabis
 wrote a book that was published two, three mont hs ago, called 
ﬁ
Guest at the Shooter™s Banquet
.ﬂ And in it she describes her journey to find out 
more about what your father™s role had been during World War II. In a wa y, to find 

out who he was. More of who he was. And I™ve read the book, and in it I also read 

that you di d not want to know until it was finished. You were going t o read it, but 

not until it  was finished, as to what  her progress was. Have I Œ am I accurate in 

sayi ng that, or were you involved in her research work? 

A: About what, the book? 

 
Interview with Danguolè Gabis  
 
December 10, 2015 
 
 
 
104
 
Q: About t he book, about what she was doing, about her Œ 
A: No, I was not at  all involved. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: No. The only Œ she came here once, with her husband, and my sist er was here, 

and we had one conversation where I think she wa Œ she was in the process of 
getting the book going. About our life in 

, and what do we remember of 
the war, and that period. And she did not  feel that we gave her a very satisfactory 

answers, that we knew enough about it. And it ™s true, you know. When you think of 

this Œ if this Œ something like that started happening here, you would be up in arms. 

But I was this young child, the country was up and down, first one i nvasion, then 

the other invasion. There was no stable government of any sort. Nobody even 

taught us about any government, stable or otherwise. So you just kind of stay with 
your family, and mind your business, and you don™t need to ask any questions. The 
rest was not up to us. The only thing I can sa y is, what you hear, what  you 

overheard. 

Q: Now, since then Œ you™ve read the book, is that correct?

A: I thought she did a very good job writing the book. I thought she Œ not only she 
wrote a beautiful book Œ she™s a very good wri ter Œ but also, she did as much 
research as was needed, and she wrote about things that I am Œ 
truly believe 

happened. 

Q: So Œ and these things involve some very bit ter and very tough Œ  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ and one could sa y brutal Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ events. 

A: And I can under Œ I expect her Œ I won™t say i nterpretat ion, because it™s not 
interpretation, it™s a fact Œ 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ that was going on. And now, knowing my father, as a grown person, though I 
alwa ys have been his favorite child, and I love hi m dearly, I know that he was a 

vain man.I don™tthink he wasa mean man, or a 
Œ a cruel man. But  I t hink he was 
vain, and I t hink he could have easily fallen int o a place where he wi ll  do things to 

promote himself. Now, how far he will go wit h that Œ as t he book sa ys, he went 

pretty far. Just about as far as you can go. But then, none of that was ever discussed

chief of security would do, because I never heard of that title. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Never met anybody who was a chief of police Œ of security poli ce. 

Q: But as Œ as 
Rita
 wri tes, it did i nvolve sending out orders to round up Jews. It  did 
involve makin
g sure they were brought to certain places. 
A: And, you know, if I had stayed, let™s sa y, in 
Jaimalas
(ph), where I knew that 

Jews lived there, and where the y lived, now, if th Œ I was Œ had I sta yed there, and 

know that they disappeared, I woul d have been more curi ous. Then I would have 

known that somet hing is happening, and what is happening. 

Q: Someone was there, and now they™re gone. 

A: Yeah, yeah, that they were arrest ed or taken away. The Œ the talk would be right 
there about it. I was in Œ in a city and town that was larger. I had never been there. I 
never knew there were any Jews t here. 

Q: And the only t hing you see from your father is that sometimes he gets drunk, that 

he didn™t before. 

A: Yeah, but then t hat™s also Œ m y father l iked to drink now and then. He never was 

the Œ a man who would sit down and get drunk by himself. But he would love Œ he 

loved company, and he would go Œ they woul d go out and the y would drink at

A: Mm-hm.

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ she interviewed some of the relatives of the Poles who were shot , as a reprisal 

Œ 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ for the killing of these two Germans. Did she present  to you a man who was a 

stranger to you, as a father, or was it someone you knew, but you didn™t know t hese 

things about him? 
A: I obviously did not know what ™s going on. I did not know what was going on 
with the Jews, and I did not know what my father™s part was in it . After everything 

was over, and I was learning history later on, and I was learning what happened, 

and thinki ng of my father in his Œ his place there, I can easily understand that she 

could Œ that that could have happened. It di d not take me by oh no, my daddy would

A: I think m y father was a bit Œ kind of the Œ he would have loved to have me marry 
a Lithuanian. I mean, t hat was his choice. If it was not Lithuanian, I don™t think he 

cared.
 
Q: I see. 

A: And 
Sta nley 
had no religious traditions. Hi s mother had no religious traditions, 
and I did not have any Christian traditions beside Œ I did have a Christmas tree up, 
but that was about it. And so, it di d not even occur to me t hat there is something 

strangethat I marry aJew.
 

Q: Did he Œ did you ever have any disagreements with your father because of it? 

A: No, no.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: He was very Œ as I say, he Œ he would have preferred me that I married a 
Lithuanian. The language, the hist ory, the traditions. That he was a Jew, and he was 
not a Lithuanian. He was so American, that I knew more about Jewish customs than 

he did, really. So, t here was never any Œ nei ther at his mother™s house, or that 

Stanley

Chicago
. My sist er moved to 
Chi cago 
al so. I had some Lithuanian friends. I was 

going to Œ to a universit y t here, and I was, for a while, very friendly with an Arab. I

A: No. 

Q: Is that what you™re saying? Oka y. Well, there are a lot of people who have tol d 

me, that after the war was over, t he y just didn™t talk about what they had gone

A: Œ you don™t real ly Œ it™s Œ it™s l ike Œ it™s not a happy ti me in your life. It™s such a

office somewhere, and he had Œ he did not  wear any uniforms, and he had a small 

apartment i n

. And I remember going over and spendi ng a da y or two 

there. I had t aken a trai n from

A: No, I di dn™t know. 

Q: Œ with police, or anyt hing. 

A: No, I wasn™t sure. I knew he was not working in a store, selling something. I 

knew he™d have to do something more likely with the Œ maybe t he police, ma ybe 

the arm y, or government, ma ybe? Do not know. And meanwhile, in 
Kupishkis
, 
things were going on a very even keel. Nothing i mportant was happening. It was 
difficult, there were shortages. And I remember for some crazy reason, I wanted to 
get a little goat. I set my heart on getting a littl e goat. So guess what? My 

grandmother, or m y aunt were able to get a pound of bacon. And for t hat pound of 

bacon, I got myself a goat. 

Q:Oh m y goodness.

Q: So, near 
Klaipeda
? 
Pala
ng a

A: It™s Œ no, no, it  was farther south. Some litt le Œ actually, some farmers that had a 

farm and had a house and had a place way i n the woods, and m y father was there, 
and we stayed there for several months, I t hink. And I remember they Œ m y father 
would go hunting to get a deer, and m y brother and I would go in the woods wit h 

hi m, and we would Œ woods are separated in squares, I think. Anyway, t here is a 

path in between, 
and my brotherwo
uld go in t he woods, and would go, making a lot 

of noise, to chase t he deer out to Œ towards my father. And one da y when we were 

out there, we found thi s package dropped, like a fairly large thing, lyi ng in the 

woods. 
Q: A package wrapped? 
A: Which l ooked like it  had a parachute on i t. So we called m y father, we picked 

this thing up, brought it  to the farm, and m y father opened i t up wi th t he farmer. 

There was a lot of money t here. Deutschmarks. 

Q: Really? 

A: And apparently what it was, pr obably it was a drop for Russians partisans, that 

must have been hiding in the woods. I was scared. I really was scared then, in that

really were ri ght on our tails. 

Q: Were there many peopleonthe roads?
 
A: There were Œ after we crossed, there were a lot of people going. We had Œ 

actually we had a bit  of a problem crossing the bridge, because by then Œ we called

A: No. 
Q: Œ as the y were growing up. No?

was Œ the Germans went. I knew t hat. What m y father™s role was in this, I had no

 s
ecurity police, well, I did not know t hat was the German 
position. I hardly ever saw Germans around.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: I didn™t even see many Germans around in t own. Very few. And when we got to 

Germany
 Œ oh, I tell you one thing, that probably be interesting. When we first 
moved to 
Germany
 and got to 
G erma ny
, in t he south, and we were t here in the s Œ 
first we were in mul Œ was it 
Mulba
(ph)?  We stayed in some little hotel. And we 
had these 
[indecipherable]
 cards, and we coul d buy food in the restaurant there, but 
they Œ all they served you, there was just watery soup basically, that™s it. And so m y 

brother and I, we take our marks, and would march out i nto the villages outside, and 

we learned Œ  we wanted to buy bread. We would say 
bro t ka ufen
. 
Brot kaufen
. It 
was late fall, and I remembered the ground would be covered wit h beautiful pears 
that just dropped off the trees. And the farmers will come out and bri ng big half 
loafs of this beautiful bread, and someti mes even Œ even some smoked meat. And 

we could take as many pears as we wanted, and we woul d want t o pay with our 

stupid marks, and the y all said, no, no. They wouldn™t take any money from us. But 

that was something that I learned, being in 
Germany
. 
Q: Why do you think that was? Why do you think the y didn™t want to take mone y 

from you?

A: I think t he y just saw two bedraggled Œ 
Q: Children. 

A: Yeah. Asking for bread. They did not know if we had 
deutschemarks
, or did not 
have, how much it was, what were they worth, if anything, by then. So Œ 

Q: Mrs. 
Danga
(ph), we™ve talked a lot today. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: We™ve covered a lot  of territory. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is there anything else you™d like to add to what you™ve said? 

A: That I would li ke to say? 
[technical interruption] 

Q: I was asking, was there anything you woul d like to add? 

A: Well 
Œ 
[pho ne ring ing

break

It sounds Œ when I tell you that , it sounds Œ i t™s 
such a remarkable, big story. Actually, very ordinary. In t he li Œ i n the ti mes that I 

lived, it™s nothing unusual. In the places that I lived. In the places t hat  I came from, 

and the times that I lived. There are hundreds of s Œ of stories like mi ne. I don™t 

know how it all ended up for them, but I t hink most of us ended up somewhere in 

the west. And did good Œ had good lives. And for m yself, when I t hink, I had a very 

good life. I mean, I had some hardships, and so on. When you are young, things are 

easy. Fortunately, I did not have any serious il lnesses, and we were never wealthy,

but we were never poor -poor. And the fact that  I cannot see that much now, but I 
live here, and I have a great deal of help. 

Q: And has this 
early 
Œ all these early years that are not filled with happy things, 

and that Œ why would one want to remember and recall them, have they Œ did they 

influence the rest of your life in any way? 
A: Perhaps. I think all our past influence our presents, to some extent. I don™t think 
of it. Now and then if I am Œ if I Œ m y brot her i s dead now, but when my brother 
was alive, we woul d remember. And now and then, when I™m wit h my sister, we 

someti mes talk about things. But  then again, t here is a seven year difference. But 

now and then we can speak about the ti me in 
Germany
, and how it was. Or how it 
was when we first came here, to 
United States
. That was an interesting thing, t oo. I 

mean, came here and no language. 
Gloria
.  
Q: 
Gloria
, yeah.
 
A:And m y sister went toh
igh school here, she finished high school here. But I 

don™t think of my life as something extraordinary, or something great ly difficult, or 

tragic in any sense. It just what it was. I consi der myself very lucky that I am here Œ 

the heat is coming on Œ that I have this house, that I am able to take care of this 

house. And that I know good people around me, and that 
Lithuania
 i s free. I know 
that they probably are fighting about the government all the ti me, but Œ

think the y will marry this spring, coming year. She changed her name to re Œ to 

Rachel

Rachel

dark, curly hair, and now it™s blonde and straight, very fashionable. She is nowhere 
as curious or interested, or searching as 
Rita
 is. 
David
 i s doing okay, he works for a 
univers Œ 
Boston
 University. He™s saving his mone y so he could retire and come 
live on the island. 

Q: It™s a nice thought. 

A: Yeah. And I really, in many things that happened to me, I could have ended, oh 

God knows where. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But there was a great deal of luck. I was 
able 
Œ we were able to get out of 
Lithuania
 when we got out, and we were l ucky enough t o come t o this country 

when we did. I had a good marriage, and endi ng up on t his island, in this house, is 

not bad.
