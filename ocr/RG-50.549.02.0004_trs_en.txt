Interview with Drexel Sprecher 
September 28, 1998 
Beginning Tape One, Side A 
Question: United States Holocaust Memo ri
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Drexel Sprech
er, conducted by Margaret West, on September 
the 28th, 1998, in Chevy Chase, Maryland. 
This is a follow up interview to a USHMM 
videotaped interview, conducted with Drex
el Sprecher on June the 18th, 1990. The 
United States Holocaust Memo rial Muse
um gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby 
Herr for making this interview possible. Th
is is tape number one, side A. If you™d -- 

would identify yourself. 

Answer: I™m Drexel A. Sprecher. I was a 
prosecutor at Nuremb erg, and I™ve been 
writing a book on Nuremb erg called, ﬁInside 
the Nuremb erg Trial, A Prosecutor™s 
Comp rehensive Account.ﬂ I™ve been worki
ng on it for nearly 10 years. It™ll be 
published in late Novemb er or Decemb er of
 this year, by the University Press of 
America. 

Q: I wonder if you™d talk next about your
 mo tivations in becoming a Nuremb erg 
prosecutor? 

A: Yes. I™d been with -- I™d written a seni
or paper during my last year in college, 
concerning the structure of national socialism,
 as we knew it at that time. And I read a 

few books, particularly by professors from 
the University of Chicago. And the book 
got a triple A, or the article got a tripi A -- tr
iple A rating, and so I had an early interest

in the Nazi regime, way back in 1933 and 
‚34. Then I went off to the London School 
of Economics for a year and there were a number of refugees there, refugees from 
Hitler, who -- with whom I became friends a
nd went out to dinner with and parties and 
so on. So I got to form some friendships th
at way. Then, of course, came the war and I 
was overseas for nearly [phone ri
nging]. Well, what was I saying? 
Q: Oh you™d -- were at the London School of Economics. 

A: Oh, and I -- as I di -- was about to say, 
I traveled around Europe a bit and twice into 
Nazi Germany. I saw the wedding of Herm
an Goering and Emma Sonamen on April 

10, 1935. I traveled into the -- the ruh r, because I™d met a German young man in 

London, who offered to show me the good hoff
noseeter and to stay overnight in their 
house and so on. He did this knowing that I 
was anti-Nazi, but his family was rather 
re-reserved, because I don™t think they wanted
 to -- they didn™t want to take a chance 
of exposing themselves too mu ch. Anyway
, I also went out one evening with -- 
somewhere near Frankfurt, with the Reve
rend Stuart Herman, H-e-r-m-a-n, who later 

became the American pastor in Berlin. He ra -- He later wrote the book, ﬁIt™s Your 

Souls We Want.ﬂ And Stu Herman a
nd I became lifelong friends, we™re still 
corresponding. After I came back from London,
 I went to school with -- I went to 
Harvard Law School for three years and my
 club won the moot court arguments, and 
the case was based on a -- a -- a labor case. So when I went down to Washington, I 

went to the Labor Board and they hired me in
 a half an hour, based on the fact that I™d 
contributed to this brief, which was on a 
point that was being argued before the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004

Supreme Court. So that started four years of 
trial work. They used me as a trial lawyer. 
Then came the war and in 1942, I enlisted 
and within a month was again back in 
England, as a sergeant and later a warrant 
officer. I was in England for six months 
until the -- after the invasion of Africa by the a
llies. I then went to Iran, Algeria, as 
administrative officer to the 
Inspector General. In that 
capacity we traveled all over 
North  Africa, inspecting American army inst
allations. I then -- An old friend of mine, 
Gerhard VanArkel, who was the deputy head of
 the German labor branch of the Office 
of Strategic Services, OSS, came to Iran 
and asked me to come up and become the 
training officer for the labor desk in Algi
ers. I had a hard time getting away from my  

boss, but I finally managed and for some
 six months I trained Germans who had 
fought on the -- for the Loyalists in Spain. 
And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being 
trained to do parachute jump ing, to do signa
ls -- signal work so they could send out 
messages after they™d jumped
 into Germany, and so forth. Then I got a call from 
Washington to come and become the training 
officer at the central desk of OSS -- a 
central desk for labor and German operatives
. And while I was there, Jack Ohly, O-h-
l-y, whom I™d known in Harvard Law School
, saw me with my  parachute wings and 
said, ﬁYou ha -- should come to work for the 
labor branch, helping us settle strikes and 
gathering labor for the short supply labor i
ndustries in the midwest.ﬂ And I said, ﬁI 
don™t think the OSS will release me.ﬂ Hi
s boss was Colonel Brennan, who later 
became a Supreme Court Justice. Colonel 
Brennan called Arthur Goldberg, who was 
my  top boss and later a memb er of the Supr
eme Court and convinced him that I should 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
5
 
 
 
perform this service. So, while that went on,
 the war finally came to an end and I came 
back to Washington with the idea of getting 
out of the army and returning to trial law 

for the labor board. At that time, s -- r -- Ju
stice Robert H. Jackson had been appointed 
to be the US Chief of Council for war crimes. He made a statement which was 

released to the press on June second, 1945.
 I was so struck by it™s -- not only it™s 
understanding of the w -- the way Hitler had co
me to power, but of it™s determination 
to see that the Nazi regime was exposed 
from beginning to end that it™s top leaders 
were brought to justice and to an explan
ation of why they had committed the evils 
they had committed. I didn™t know how to ge
t with Justice Jackson™s group, because I 
didn™t know him at the time. So I went ba
ck to OSS and my  old fraternity brother, 
Robert Thrun, T-h-r-u-n, was one of the th
ree assistants to Wild Bill Donovan, the 
head of OSS. General Wild Bill Donovan. 
And I had told him my dilemma, and he 
says, ﬁWell, we can take care of that.ﬂ So
 we went down to see the general council of 
OSS, who is another Donovan, a James D
onovan. And Jim Donovan hired me within a 
half hour and for the next month or so, I 
busily engaged in studying in detail, the OSS 
reports on Nazi Germany, and they were 
terrific and very well done. And a professor 
by the name of Noiman had written a 
book on Nazi Germany -- just a second -- 
Noiman had written a book called, ﬁBehemothﬂ 
and I studied that in some detail and 
then went in to see him. And I told him of my  background and he said, ﬁWell, I -- Of 

course you™re interested in the destructi
on of the trade unions by the Nazis.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁYes.ﬂ He reached back and pulled 
out a German book that had been obtained by 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
6
 
 
 
OSS through Switzerland. And, an appendix 
in that German book contained the order 
of Robert Ley, L-e-y, the later defendant
 at Nuremberg who committed suicide. And 
Robert Ley had written this order on how 
the SA -- the Storm Troopers and the SS 
were to take over the trade unions. Well, this
 gave me the basis for not only a brief and 
for a -- an eventual presentation to the tribuna
l, it also gave me leads to labor leader 
with whom OSS was in touch, both in London and some of them in Germany. So I 

flew to London, Paris and then went into 
Germany to visit some of these trade union 
leaders. And I got affidavits from all of th em and those affidavits were all introduced 

in the Nuremberg -- first Nuremberg trial.
 Neither one of the affiants was cross-
examined by the defense, they didn™t questi
on at all the -- the horrors that surrounded 
that particular aspect of the Nazi regi
me. The result was that that made some 

impression on Justice Jackson and later on others and the main deputy to Jackson, 

Colonel Robert G. Storey, who later became 
head of the American Bar Association, he 
was quite impressed by this work and said, 
ﬁYou mu st make some -- a presentation to 

the tribunal,ﬂ which of course delighted me. And he assigned me the case of a Baldur 

von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader, who la
ter became the Gauleiter of Vienna. 
Q: Let me interrupt to ask a question. Do
 you think that had you not sort of pushed 
yourself forward, you would ever have been 
approached to play a role? You s -- You 
were peculiarly fitted, I think, but I wondere
d if it™s because you were aware of that fit 
and felt at once, very strongly, that this 
was something you wanted to be involved in? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
7
 
 
 
A: Yes, as soon as I heard Justice Jack -- 
read Justice Jackson™s report, I knew there 
was where Sprecher should next go. And so I™d
 determined to get there one way or the 
other, and it turned out to be a relatively easy path.  

Q: I also want to go back to what we talk
ed about before, really, your mo tivations, but 
in becoming involved, did you feel that 
you had something personal you wanted to 
achieve? I don™t mean for the sake of your 
personal ego or career, but did you feel 
passionately about what this pr
osecution was going to achieve? 

A: I felt passionately about what 
the prosecution could achieve. 
Q: And then, what did -- what do you feel the Nuremb erg trial -- what do you feel the 

effect was on you later? The -- Y-Your own 
writings bear testimony 
to what happened, 
but if we move forward, how do you look 
back on it and do you feel that it™s been 
evolving over many years, the impact? 

A: The impact of the Nuremberg trial on 
American public opinion was considerable 
for approximately one year. And then, with 
the coming of the -- after the war, with the 
coming of the Cold War, American opinion and 
the journalists and so on, turned very 
rapidly toward discussions of the Cold Wa
r and the Nazis and the Nuremberg trials 

were very mu ch played down and not talked 
up for some time. I turned away to other 
things here in America, and then got invol
ved in some business affairs and then got 
into Behavioral Science and teaching at Ge
orge Washington University in Behavioral 
Science, which is a new field for me, but I r
eally worked hard to get there and a couple 
of professors were kind of pushing me to do th
at. And then I began to get interested in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
8
 
 
 
Nuremb erg again, particularly after I th -- mo re or less retired, although I -- I didn™t 
comp letely retire from training and consulting.
 But I slowed down a lot and I started to 
first work on Baldur von Schirach, the usel
 -- the youth leader, who -- wh-whom I had 

particularly prosecuted, I™d made the principal presentation against him. Then I 

decided I™d switch to something which was 
talked mo re about and that was Julius 
Streicher, the top Jew baiter of all time. But 
then, a lot was written about him, and so I 
started to move toward the idea of seeing 
if I couldn™t contribute something different 
by writing the mo st elaborate book, the mo
st comp rehensive book on the Nuremb erg 
trials, one which would agree with mo st of
 the conclusions that many other writers 
have made, but which would go beyond that, 
into the depth of the evidence, and 
particularly quotations from the contempor
aneous documents and from the testimony 

of the 20 -- of the 22 defendants who we
re at Nuremb erg -- 21 defendants. The 
consequence was that I finally developed 
a huge book, far too long for publication. It 
was rejected by a number of commercial presses as being financially unbearable with 

it™s length, and I think it was, especially for a commercial press. I then started 

approaching university presses and they all insisted that the book should be reduced 

somewhat in size, so it™d fit into two volum
es, rather than thre
e. And so I spent a 
couple of years doing the difficult task of c
ondensing. And finally, the university press 
of America, based on all the commendations
 that I had and their own scholarly 
research, decided that the book did have a spec
ial role to play and so I™m -- was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
9
 
 
 
glad to sign a contract with them and my
 book will be published in late December -- or 
late No-November or early December. 
Q: And of course the length publishers wa
nt has nothing to do with the value of 

something to posterity. You know, your material and work is there to be handed on, in 

full length. 

A: Yes, that™s what distinguishes the 
book mainly. I don™t attemp t to be the final 
preacher about the Nazi regime, but I mean to
 make the account of the trial available, 
so that many scholars and a lot of others 
that are r-really interested and willing to 
spend some time, can really delve in
to the contemporaneous documents and 
particularly into the motivations of the defe
ndants. It™s so false for people to think of 
the Nuremb erg in terms of defendants sayi
ng, ﬁI was following superior orders.ﬂ 
These defendants worked for years for the Na
zis and superior orders defense applies 
mainly to lower people in the 
-- at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are told to go and 
shoot somebody or to commit some atrocious 
crime. The people at the top give their 
loyalties to a regime over a period of time, 
and they do it for many different reasons. It 
has little to do with, I was ordered to do this by somebody. Most of the enthusiastically 

worked for the Nazi regime. So
me of them, of course, had great reservations and some 
of them wept as they gave their tes
timony, being very sorry indeed, for having 
associated themselves with such
 an evil course of conduct.  
Q: When you talked of Nuremb erg and the fa
ct that it was only for a year that it was 

extensively covered in the American press, I -- I™d like you to say mo re about that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
10
 
 
 
because I™m sure you feel that the very
 holding of the tribunal was immensely 
important in documenting what had gone on. 
I -- I was just reading about Benjamin 
Firense a-as just one small example of so
mebody gathering evidence. But I™m sure we 
gained immensely through -- in manyways, through holding the tribunal. 
A: Yes, Professor Firense came to Nuremb
erg and when he find -- found out about the 
Einsatzgruppen, he immediately started to make some proposals to General Telford 

Taylor about his leading that -- the ca
se against the main leaders of the 
Einsatzgruppen, the special task forces 
which killed millions -- a couple million Jews. 
And he did this with great ability and aplomb
 and he presented the case almost entirely 
with documents in an -- less than a day a
nd one half. The case went on for months 
after that, by the defense, but the prosecutions
 case, in the shortest Nuremberg case of 

all -- the short -- the shortest case of 
the prosecution, was the one conducted by 
Firense. I became the head of several divi
sions, the subsequent 
proceedings division, 
economics division, chief of the I. G. Farben
 trial team, and later, deputy chief council 
in charge of the official publications. At -- 
Firense had been offered the job, by Telford 

Taylor, of being director of 
publications. He turned it down in order to become head of 
the Jewish successor restitution organization 
and he recovered from German firms tha 
-- who had employed slave labor and who™d 
taken property from Jews, he recovered 
vast quantities of money for the people invol
ved at -- the survivors of the -- of the 
people that were involved or the -- some of
 the people who still survived. And to this 
day, he™s one of my  best friends.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
11
 
 
 
Q: What -- You™re in touch with a number 
of people whose experience was somewhat 
simu  -- similar. You mentioned for instance, a -- as a good friend. Have you talked 
with these colleagues about the impact or th
e effect of Nuremb erg on your lives, and is 
there any similarity, sort of commonality of experience? 

A: I™ve talked to almost all 
the survivors, in fact, I was 
the chairman of the executive 
committee that put on three Nuremb erg re
unions, beginning in 1979, nine -- then 
another 1991 and one in 1996 at the -- mo re or
 less at the 50th anniversary of the end 
of the first Nuremberg trial. And I™m in touch with almo st all these prosecutors. I™ve 

sent them chapters from my forthcoming book.
 I™ve asked for their criticisms and their 
comments. I don™t think anybody surviving know
s as mu ch about the people who were 

in Nuremb erg than -- than I do. I don™t think so, because of my  continued work on this 

subject. I have constantly wanted to be in touch with them. 

Q: And what do you think the impact has b
een? Has it colored everything that you™ve 
done subsequently? 

A: Oh yes, I -- You don™t do anything as signi
ficant as the Nuremb erg trial was, in 
reviewing a modern dictatorship, without th
at having a tremendous effect emotionally, 
on you. I think the importance of the trial is 
mu ch mo re on what it revealed than in the 
fact that it punished 19 defendants, and acquitte
d three. The effect of the trial later on, 
was very mixed. For some years, it had very
 little effect, and then as war crimes were 
committed in ce-central Europe, particularly 
in Yugoslavia, and then later in Rwanda, 
world attention turned much mo
re to what international law was, that international law 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
12
 
 
 
was being violated, and that there was no es
tablished structure to deal with these 
crimes, and that no court was available wh
ich was -- had jurisdiction to handle these 
matters. So then you started to get the f
oundation laid and an international treaty 
signed to create the Yugoslav war crimes tri
bunal, and later on the United Nations also 
created the Rwanda tribunal. The Rwa
nda tribunal has had a great number of 
difficulties. It was poorly staffed, poorly fi
nanced and was not well taken -- it was not 
well administrated. On the contrary, I thi
nk the -- the beginnings of the Yugoslav war 
crimes tribunal are very promising. They 
do not have the number of contemporaneous 
documents or the great amount of contempor
aneous documents which we had in the 
Nuremberg trial. This means they have to
 rely mu ch mo re on investigations and 
interrogating witnesses and that™s a mu ch 
mo re difficult job to do when you don™t have 
all the knowledge that we had about the 
detailed operation of the Nazi regime. 
Q: What are the main shortcomings of these later tribunals? 

A: International opinion does not regard them 
as essential to scoring the up events and 
il-illuminating the background and the nature wh
at went on in the Balkans that led to 
some of these things. They ar
en™t international opinion on the whole, is not in the same 
position of knowledge with respect to what
™s going on. And you don™t have the same 
push, the same public demand. And the 
tremendous number of countries are so 
troubled by their own internal problems that
 they have not pushed the United Nations 
or the established tribunal to do mo re, mo re 
quickly, and they haven™t given it as mu ch 
funding and -- as they should. There are some 
very able people that have gone into the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
13
 
 
 
leadership of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and I wish them well. I think that they 
are going to make a -- a big contribution in the long run. 

Q: I wonder if you™d talk about areas of invol
vement in your life later, that you see as 
having a direct involvement w
ith your Nuremb erg experience. 
A: I was asked to make a number of speeche
s at conferences of one kind and another 
and of course I was instrumental with he
alth and my  wife and others in putting on 

these three Nuremb erg reunions. And this took up a lot of time and -- it meant that, 

however, that we were able to call back my
 former associates in Nuremberg and keep 
in touch with them. Nuremb erg is not someth
ing that wears out of your life with time. 
It -- It becomes a -- an area where you thi
nk about it at night and you think about it in 
the mo rning and you wonder what can the world do, what can --  how can public 

opinion be advanced so that they™re willing 
to reduce the rights of national sovereignty 
to a greater extent and to make the in
ternational law really international and 
enforceable by international 
agency. There are a tremendous
 number of isolationists 
and people who raise their hands and say, ﬁWe don™t want any foreigners in a position 

where they can possibly judge Americans.ﬂ Ther
e™s a certain appeal in that for citizens 
who are not too well informed, and it™s regrettable. 

Q: Do you think there are grounds for optim
ism though? Do you feel things are getting 
better or getting worse? 

A: No, I think things are getting somewhat 
better. I don™t think the pace is nearly as 
great as it should be and certainly not 
as great as I would like to have it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
14
 
 
 
Q: And how can we change people™s attitudes?  
A: By mo re education in international affairs at a younger age, for younger people. By 

having more of the -- the books that have 
been written on Nuremberg circulated more 
widely, building up interest in -- in a broade
r public education, so that people are mo re 

aware of -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Drexel Sprecher. This is tape numbe
r one, side B. Do you think your trips that 

you made as a young man to Germany, I thi
nk it was 1929 - 1934, was that a part of 
the forming of your own internationalism, if you like? 

A: Oh yes indeed. The fact that I studi
ed in London and I met many refugees from 
Hitler, that I traveled into Germany while
 Hitler was in -- in power, in 1934 and 1935, 
the fact that I worked with 
anti-Nazi Germans in the Office of Strategic Service, just 
left an -- an indelible imprint on my -- my whole life.  

Q: What about the imprint left by your pa rent™s values? What you had absorbed from 

them or been taught by them? 

A: It had very little influence. I came from a middle class, lower upper class, small 

town family. My father was a banker. He™d
 been president of the Wisconsin Bar 
Association and I don™t think he paid very 
much attention to the Nazi regime until I 

began to become active in my  thinking about
 the Nazi regime and told him something 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
15
 
 
 
about it. He was certainly never symp athetic 
to the Nazi regime that I know of, but he 
was not active with respect to international affairs. 
Q: Now, he did have -- your parents did ha
ve religious views, so would you not have 
perhaps had a strong mo ral sense that
 you would have absorbed from them? 
A: Well, you touch on a very important point, 
not so mu ch because of the mo ral values 
that my  parents had, but they sent me to a small college my  first year, North Central 

College, and there I met a minister by the 
name of Ralph Marion Holdiman, who was 

a very active Christian Socialist and his ethi
cal values were very stretched into the 
political area and by the time I was done with th
at first year away at college, I was -- I 
was beginning to see the roots of Fascism in 
Germany and of course then, when I went 
to the University of Wisconsin, Hitler cam
e to power during my junior year, and a 

number of professors played this up as one
 might expect, because it was certainly a 
tremendously forbidding development in intern
ational affairs. One of my  professors 
was Selac Perlman, who was the chief historia
n of labor developments in this country. 

And I can rememb er one day in a seminar that he burst into tears as someone 

mentioned what was happening in Nazi Ge
rmany. And it was a very moving mo ment 

and I can still remember it very well. Max Ca
rl Otto was a -- an American of German 
descent who was very anti-Nazi and he was also
 one of my  heroes at the University of 
Wisconsin. I was asked to run the conference  on war at the University of Wisconsin, 

shortly after Hitler came to power, and we
 gathered leaders, including people from 
military academies and professors from both 
Wisconsin and other universities, some 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
16
 
 
 
ministers, like Re-Reverend Alf da -- Alfred 
W. Swan and others and they made talks 
and there was questions by the students and 
there were some demonstrations about 
how important the whole thing was, by some 
of the students. And that put me on the 
bandwagon. 

Q: And it does seem as if the early years have those strands, if you like, that become a 

theme throughout your life. I™m thinking of  the group you were involved in as a 

student, Coinose? 

A: Coinose. 

Q: Oh then, I wonder if you™d tell the story 
too, of Beverly, that you mentioned once. 
A: Oh it -- I -- I made a number of f-friends 
at the University of Wisconsin, who had 
strong ethical feelings. Catholics, Protes
tants and Jews. And a number of us got 
together and got the idea that if we held a number of meetings, it might help make a 

contribution to fighting this -- this racism 
and contribute to the 
broader education of 
students. One of them was Beverly Rabi
noff, who was a Badger Beauty. She was one 
of the five women elected to that nobl
e category because of her good looks. There 
were an -- a number of other people, Geor
ge Dugger, Bill Blaiser, who were Aryans 
who were very active in this movement 
and we called it, ﬁIn Common,ﬂ which was 
from the Greek word meaning in common -- 
coinose. We held meetings. We didn™t 
allow people to join Coinose unless they ha
d at least a B average and unless they™d 
done something on the campus. Well that ma
de it kind of a distinct group and people 
kind of looked at us in a different way  
than if we™d just said, ﬁHey, everybody can 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
17
 
 
 
join Coinose.ﬂ And it turned out to be a very
 useful thing, they got a ver -- very great 
amount attention, including by the president of the university.  
Q: But you -- What it was -- after, I rememb
er you talking aboutincluding Beverly in 
a -- I think it was a fraternity dance. 

A: Oh yes. There was quite a bit of segr
egation at the universities back in the 1930™s 
and there were Jewish fraternities a
nd non-Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish 

sororities and so on. And the -- there was ve
ry little mixing of -- inside the frater -- the 
sorority or fraternity houses of Jews a
nd Gentiles. So Beverly Rabinoff, being a good 
friend of mine, I said to her one day, ﬁBev
erly, I™ve been asked to go to the Tri-Delt 
House,ﬂ -- the -- one of the sororities, ﬁf
or a party. And I™m wondering if you would 
like to be my guest?ﬂ And she said, ﬁOh, that
™ll upset things a great deal.ﬂ And I said, 
ﬁWell, why not? After all, you™re a Badger Be
auty, and if you go in there, we™ll cause 
-- with me -- we™ll cause quite a sensation.ﬂ 
So we ap -- walked in
to the sorority house 
at the time of that party and people™s 
jaws dropped. However, within minutes, 
everybody wanted to dance with Beverly Rabi
noff. All the men wanted to dance with 
her and I was left alone throughout mo st of
 the evening while other people danced 
with Beverly Rabinoff. So that was a small contribution to integration. 

Q: Do you have a lot of other examples like that? 

A: Well, in my fraternity, which had no Je
ws, Phi Gamma Delta, I got el -- Edward 
Ellsworth Ross, who was a former Phi Gam to
 come and talk and I urged him to talk 
about the segregation problem and things lik
e that, which he did. And so there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
18
 
 
 
some things like that. The dean of students,
 a fellow by the name of Holt, H-o-l-t, his 
son was in our fraternity. We went to hi s house and -- and the overall dean was Scott 
Goodenite. Bill Blaiser, who was the head of
 the student union, and I, went up to see 

him and told him that we were about to tr
y something, that we wanted him to know 
what it was. Some Jews had gone onto the pi
er that stuck out into Lake Mindoda, of 
one of the fraternity houses -- I forget th
e name of it right now. And a fellow by the 
name of Max Knecht, K-n-e-c-h-t, who wa
s the boxing champion of the big 10, went 
out with a couple of his fraternity brothers 
and threw these Jews in the lake. And this, 
of course, made a lot of newspaper publicity
. Blaiser -- Bill Blaiser and I didn™t want it 
to die at that point, so we went to Goode nite and said, ﬁWe™re going down to see --ﬂ 

Blaiser was over six feet tall and so was I, a
nd together we weren™t too afraid of Max 
Knecht. So we went down to the fraternity 
and asked to see him 
and he blustered out 
and said, ﬁWhat are you liberals doing here?ﬂ We said, ﬁWe™ve come to tell you that if 

you were to repeat what you did before, we 
can give you the straight word that you™d 
be ostracized from the university and that
 we would gather a group of people and 

throw you in the lake just to show that we 
wouldn™t take this kind of thing any mo re.ﬂ 
And he said, ﬁRrrr,ﬂ and turned around, banged the door and left. But Max Knecht 

never threw any more Jews in the lake. 

Q: Now, you said that he was calling 
you a liberal, but what was your family 
background, liberal or very conservative? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
19
 
 
 
A: Very conservative. And -- But they didn™
t have any strong pred -- prejudices about 
race, as far as I know. We only had two Jewish
 families in the little town I lived in and 
both of them patronized my  father™s bank. 
And I bought my  shoes there and things like 
that. 
Q: What about your own politics and the way in which your Nuremberg experience 

might have colored that? 

A: Well, I became very active in politics afte
r I returned from Nure
mberg. Up to that 
time, I had been an active De
mo crat in the sense of making a few contributions to the 
Democratic party and congre
ssional campaign committees and so on, but I hadn™t been 
very active. But when I ca
me back from Nuremberg, my
 wife was also an active 
Democrat and I settled out in Potomac, Mary
land area, which is largely an area of 
relatively wealthy people. And a lot of brai
ny people, a lot of intellectuals who had 
done well. So we formed -- I became precinc
t chairman and we also formed a -- a 
group out there, which was calculated to 
give talks about -- in the churches and 

otherwise, about anti-Semitism and -- and so 
forth and the local pastors were all for 
this. Reverend Gloid Alice in the Methodist church was one of our great supporters 

and so forth. So, yes, this did have an e-e
ffect and I went down to the hill with the idea 
of becoming an assistant to somebody that wa
s helping on small business affairs, since 
I was running a couple of small businesse
s. A land development comp any and a 
construction comp any out in Potomac. A
nd I met Senator Sparkman, head of the 

Senate small business committee, and Rite
 Patman, the head of the House small 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
20
 
 
 
business committee. I went in to s -- Th
ey said I should go see Paul Butler, the 
national chairman of the Democratic part
y and I did and he established the small 
business division of the Democrat national 
committee, which was composed of me and 
my secretary, no more. And we develope
d a lot of literature, which was broadly 
circulated to the state parties, county 
and local people, concerning small business 
issues. So that was my first move, actively 
into politics. About a year later, after the 
1956 election, I was back to doing what I ha d been doing before, someone said -- Paul 

Butler, the national chairman, was forming 
a new s-structures to the Democratic 
national committee, which was going to pull 
together the political organization and 
build up mo re precincts and ex-extend the am
ount of public relations that the national 
committee was going to have with the local or
ganizations between elections. So I went 
in to see Paul Butler and he immediately said
, ﬁWell, I™d like to hire you, but I have to 
consult with the advisory committee on po
litical organization.ﬂ So I flew out to 
Michigan to see former congressman, Neal 
Staebler, S-t-a-e-b-l-e-r, who was the state 
chairman of the Demo cratic party in Michig
an. And he introduced me to the Michigan 
leaders, and we sat down and had a dinner t
ogether and they queried me and they came 
back with the recommendation that I be 
made deputy chairman of the national 
committee -- deputy chairman for political orga
nization. And we then hired a total of 
six regional representatives, each one of whom
 had six to eight states, and he -- they 
traveled around, building up ideas of better De
mo cratic organization, and not trying to 
be pushy, but ta -- get mo re people involved,
 hold mo re meetings and they would be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
21
 
 
 
available to see what was happening in another 
state, to help -- still a different state, ye 
-- other notions and ideas and try new 
things out and things like that.  
Q: Now what would the group have grille d you about, when they met with you over 
dinner, do you rememb er? 

A: Not particularly. It was a very friendl
y discussion between active Demo crats. And 
of course, they were interested in the fact 
that I™d been a prosecutor at Nuremb erg and 
that I had edited the official volumes on the 
later 12 trials, the so-called Green series 
and I think they were kind of glad to have me come aboard. 

Q: No, I just wondered what role Nuremb
erg might have had in -- in that, and you 
answered. 

A: I don™t think it -- I don™t think it had mu ch 
direct role, it -- Nuremb erg exposures of 
things that were against demo cracy and th e dictatorship, of course, contributed to 

demo cracy and I often mentioned the Fascist 
dictatorship in my  discussions, naturally, 
because they™d been
 such a big part of my life, earlier. 
Q: Mm-hm. Your years as deputy ch
air, wh-what do you look back on as your 
accomplishments in that role? 

A: Well, we were asked to come to the 
Demo cratic National Convention and to make 
a presentation to the whole convention. So 
Paul Butler introduced me and I said, fac -- 
many of you people here, that are active at th
e state level, know what has been done by 
the political organization wing of the Democr
atic National Committee. Well, I want to 
just -- just tell you a few things that we ha
ve done and will be doing and to ha -- allow 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
22
 
 
 
you to ask questions, encourag
e your questions and then I want to have each of the 
regional representatives talk to you and so 
on. So, up here, in a little book that contains 
the proceedings of the Democratic Na
tional Committee convention in 1959, you™ll 

find about 10 pages where we spoke for pe
rhaps altogether, up to nearly an hour. 
Q: What were the most important issues th
en? You were in that role from -- Was that 
1957 to 1960? 

A: Yes. Do you know, I -- I have a hard time now, figuring out what the roles were 

that we mo st talked about. I think they 
generally involved the idea of mo re social 
reform that would benefeet-fit people. We 
had a -- a senior citizens group as well and 
we had an agriculture group, a farmer™s gr
oup. We had a labor group, and they were 
available to help push demo cratic ideas 
through the demo cratic digest and through 
special releases and through the many sp
eeches that we helped influence.  
Q: What about Nuremberg and your -- your pos
t-Nuremberg sort of sensitivity in the 

decades after that? I™m thinking of major 
events, the Civil Rights Movement or the 
McCarthy era or the Feminist movement. I 
think you would have been a person with 
sort of strong views on -- at all these times, 
a clear sense of what was right and wrong. 
A: Well, yes, but I -- I think it™s rather di
fficult for me to go into all the ethical and 
political implications of that time back ther
e, three years before 1960. We helped elect 
President Kennedy and we were delighted with
 that. I can still remember when he was 
leaving the platform in -- at the 1960 
convention and somepoor photographer had 
gotten off to the side and -- and had misse
d him, so I flagged him down as he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
23
 
 
 
walking across the exit ramp , and he stopped 
and waved and this fellow took a picture. 
Well, little things like that are those that 
stick out in your mind as you look back. The 
fact that you -- we had a big conference in
 Colorado and -- and there was a head table 
of about 17. The head of the party in Co
lorado had the central seat and Kennedy sat 
next to him, in the middle. I sat in seat 
17, on the very end and I said nothing, because 
I wasn™t called on to say anything. We
™d -- We weren™t -- We didn™t -- The 
[indecipherable] organization side of the 
Democratic National Committee encouraged 
other people to be active and talking a
nd doing things. We were not the public 
relations side of the committee, which 
created speeches and things like that. 
Q: But it would be hugely important. 

A: Yes, it -- some people have said that™s
 -- without our work, that Kennedy wouldn™t 
have been elected. Well, I think that™s pr
oblematical, but in all events, we were 
certainly a large contribution.  

Q: Did you talk, you know, in these -- a-at 
these times? Would your experiences at 
Nuremb erg had been something that you™d -- 
would often -- would it often come up in 
conversation? 

A: No, no. 

Q: You have a chapter in your book on the le
gacy of Nuremb erg, but I™d wonder if 
you™d talk about that in general terms? 

A: Well, aft -- right after the first trial, the general assembly of the United Nations, 

enacted a declaration on international law a
nd affirming the principles of Nuremb erg. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
24
 
 
 
I™m not sure that that made a tremendous efe -- had a tremendous effect on the -- large 
numbers of people, but it did contribut
e to those who were concerned with 

international law and with strengthening the 
United Nations and international law. The 
Nuremberg trial set a precedent for trials held immediately after the first trial. In 

Nuremb erg there were 12 other trials, a to
tal of about 190 other people were tried. 

Then there were trials in the British war z
one. There were trials in the French war 

zone. We didn™t hear about any trials in th
e Soviet zone. The Soviet representative at 
the first Nuremb erg trial, left Nuremb erg the -- just after th-the tribunal made it™s 

decision in the first trial and they never associ
ated with the later trials, at their election. 
However, they did allow our representatives 
to carry on investigations in the Soviet 
zone and they were cooperative in that re
spect. About two years later, during the later 
trials, a press contingent of Soviet journa
lists, did come to Nuremb erg for one or two 

days and I recall sitting in with General Taylor as he was asked questions by them. 

And of course, we tried to turn it around and 
ask them a few questions as to why there 
were -- had been some trials that we knew 
about in the eastern zone of Germany, and 
they were rather embarrassed by that. Towa
rd the end of the trials, the Genocide 
Convention was enacted as a treaty and it is of
 course, since been ratified by almo st all 
nations. it took the United States quite some 
time to recognize it, because again some 

people, raising the banner of
 sovereignty were worried 
that the Genocide Convention 
would give other people the right to l
ook into what was happening in the United 
States. The declaration of -- of  human rights by the General Assemb ly was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
25
 
 
 
[indecipherable] related to the rights we 
ex -- expounded at Nuremb erg. And Eleanor 
Roosevelt at that time, said, ﬁThis is a fi
ne declaration on human rights, but without 
some legal obligations, will governments be 
inspired to see that these rights are 
enforced?ﬂ And of course, that was a 
very incisive comment. The -- As I™ve 
mentioned, the international law committee 
of the United Nations did reaffirm the 
Nuremb erg principles and this led -- after we
 left Germany, this helped lead to a 
tremendous number of trials of Germans, 
by the German courts. This is something 
mo st people don™t know anything about. Th
ere™s a whole book on it by a gentleman by 
the name of Rukerle, who was -- who was in  charge of keeping track of these war 
crimes trials. And there™s been a treme
ndous number of books pub
lished in Germany, 
which deal with the Nazi regime and an
 American photographer by the name of Ray 
Daddario, has cooperated with the Germ
an authorities in publishing a number of 
photographs concerning the Nazi regime and th
e Nuremb erg trial, and these have sold 
very well. In Berlin there are at least two 
striking exhibitions that refer back to the 

Nazi period. One is in the old Reichstag 
building, and there they have a photographic 
exhibit that mu st be a half block long, 
where you walk along and you get pictures of 
the development of the Nazi regime, in
cluding it™s horrors. A little ways away from 
that, there is a -- what™s called a Platzen
zae memo-memorial. And that™s a very 

striking memorial. It has a -- a marble wall 
which says, in German, ﬁTo the victims of 
Fascism.ﬂ A little ways away, there™s a circular statue -- there™s a statue with a -- a 

base which is circular and it has arrows 
which point in the direction of various 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
26
 
 
 
concentration camps, Auschwitz, Flossenbürg,
 Buchenwald. And it™s very striking, 
you can™t think as you walk by that, wit
hout realizing that in each of these 
concentration camps, hundreds of
 thousands and in the case
 of Auschwitz, millions of 
people were killed. The German Minister
 of Justice has spoken out about the 
significance of the Nuremb erg trials. There™s been a tremendous turnaround in 
German thinking, partly as a result of the 
Nuremb erg trials. Course, one of the striking 
things about the Vietnam war is that a coupl e of our officers also went on a binge of 

killing Vietnamese citizens, the kind of thi
ng that can happen when an ideologically 
motivated person is not constrained and is 
willing to kill people, certainly outside the 
law. This led to the conviction of Lieute
nant William Calley, C-a-l-l-e-y, a junior 

officer in the US army. So this is one ca
se where we™ve applied international law to 
one of our own officers, which is a good thi ng. The greatest thing that™s happened by 

way of specific action, took place under the administration of President George Bush, 

after Saddam Hussein and forces
 of Iraq had invaded Kuwait --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Drexel Sprecher. This is tape number 
two, side A. You were just talking about 
the Gulf War. 
A: Yes, in 1990, after Saddam Hussein invade
d Iraq, George Bush -- President George 
Bush, after consultation with a number of 
people that were leaders in the United 
Nations and the Secretary General of NATO, 
he ordered military forces of the United 
States to take measures to push back the 
for -- forces of Iraq. This was done in a 

magnificent fashion, by a -- special troops. Th
e trouble is that an agreement was made 
with Saddam Hussein, which didn™t provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and 

which didn™t provide for any war crimes tria
ls, and which allowed him, over time, to 
re-institute a dictatorship of the first wa
ter. Now, that is utterly different than 

Nuremberg, where we -- the allies that oc
cupied the country, they not only conducted 

war crimes trials, but they assisted the democratic elements, which were latent in 

Germany, to slowly develop and to come out
. We did not have the wisdom to do that, 
as a country, and -- in connection with the Un
ited Nations at the time, which is a mo st 
regrettable thing, and yet it does deal with 
the thing that started out very well. An 
inconclusive truce. I suppose the next thi
ng would be what happe
ned in Yugoslavia, 
and -- beginning in 1991, when military forces
 of Serbia invaded Bosnia and Croatia, 

there were atrocities committed on a huge scal
e and the fact that there had been a 
Nuremberg trial certainly did help, with re
spect to the creation of the international 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
28
 
 
 
criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The war crimes are being studied on a 
great -- a greatly improved scale, by a num
ber of universities. The -- At American 
College of Law, here in Washington, it™
s a part of the American University, a 
professor by the name of Diane F. Orentliche
r, O-r-e-n-t-l-i-c-h-e-r, is the director of 
the war crimes research office, and she ha
s led a group which has helped investigate 
the details of what happened in Yugosla via and passed them on to the tribunal, 

because the tribunal didn™t have an adequate
 staff to do as good a job as it might. And 
that very creditable work has been apprec
iated by several of the top prosecutors, 
including Louise Arbour, A-r-b-o-u-r, and a c
onference was held at the Washington 
College of Law School -- the Wa-Washington 
College of Law, and several of these 
representatives, the very top ones, from the International War Crimes Tribunal in The 

Hague, came and participated in that 
trial, which got fairly good publicity. 
Q: And you were involved in that? 

A: Yes, in a minor way. I -- I made one 
little talk and so forth, but thank goodness she 
had trained and gotten a lot of people 
who are presently active. And so my 
contribution was very limited, 
and should have been very limited, because they were 
all sa -- the top people there were all fam
iliar with what had happened at Nuremberg 
and what I might say would be
 redundant and not too useful. 
Q: Are we moving quickly enough, do you thi
nk? I mean, we™re -- I™m -- I™m thinking 
of the year 2000 and really this is a ne
w area of -- of law that™s evolving. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
29
 
 
 
A: Well, what™s evolving is not so mu ch th
e law itself, because I think that™s relatively 
clear. It™s acceptance by many of the sovere
ign nations that™s still not appropriate, 
number one, and number two, we don™t have
 an international structure that™s 
sufficiently powerful. The enactment of the International War Crimes Tribunal Treaty 

earlier this year at Rome, the Rome treaty, is
 a big step in the right direction, but look 
what year it is. It™s the year 1998 and that™s 
still -- that treaty still has to be ratified by 
a number of leading nations, including the United 
States. So th-the -- these is -- this is 
a very unpleasant area for someone like me, 
who would like to see that moving mu ch 
mo re rapidly. 

Q: How do you think we can change, mo st
 quickly, mankind™s viewpoint on this? I 

mean, you went through a particular experi
ence in your life, but how can that 
education you had, that sensitivity
 be spread to more people? 
A: Well, it isn™t just a question of spread
ing sensitivity to more people. If people are 
poor, if people are struggling to stay alive,
 they tend to be willing to follow a person 
who has simp le answers and who claims to ha
ve an enemy, particularly a neighbor or 

a group or a race. And he drums up agitati
on about that and these poor, relatively 
uneducated people throng to his support. So 
the question of war crimes really gets 
down partly to the world™s ability to feed 
more people, on the one hand, and to curb 
population growth on the other, so we don™t 
have these tremendous cases of people 
struggling to stay alive, in terms of lim
ited resources. And the 
question of educating 
people who are struggling and fighting among themselves and having great 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
30
 
 
 
difficulties, to sit back and think and le
arn, is certainly a central difficulty. 
Q: Do you have great concern over the incr
easing discrepancy i -- within the United 
States, of wealth? 
A: Yes, indeed, yes indeed. How many peopl
e are living just above the standard of 
living or just below it? And here we are, 
supposedly in a very prosperous ca -- time, 
and yet there are just tremendous numbers
 of people who are ill-educated and don™t 
have the opportunity to forge ahead. The 
-- The remaining unequal treatment -- the 
continuing unequal treatment of women, is 
certainly a significant area where more 
people have got to become concerned and to do something. What -- I™m -- I -- My 

main worry is -- is places like Africa, where you have civil wars on every other 

country going on, and undoubtedly 
war crimes or civilian crimes that are at such a 
broad rate that they have to be classifi
ed as something of -- as violations of 
international law as well. These things have
 got to be addressed and mo re people have 
got to get to work educating more 
people, who will do something about it. 
Q: When you refer to women, were you thi nking of women within the United States, 

or really women worldwide in the -- the ha
ves and have-nots of -- you know, the lot of 

women in the developing world? 

A: Well, I think Marian Wright Edelman, 
who™s -- heads the Children™s Defense Fund, 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton and a number of
 other people are trying to do something 
to a-advance the treatment and education of
 children, as well as to involve mo re 
women in the economic affairs and the politic
al affairs of this nation. And, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
31
 
 
 
mo re power to them, but it™s a long way to go. So many people are struggling from 
day to day that they don™t have time to 
really sit down and think things through. 
Q: I wonder if I could ask, I™m -- I™m thinki
ng of today as just one example of a day 
and with each day™s news, I would suppose th
at you have an interesting viewpoint on 
it. And a -- I was thinking today of the elec
tion of a new political leader in Germany, 

and w-within the United States, I™m -- I™m 
thinking of the Lewinsky case. There may 
be other things you want to comment on, 
but a -- I just think that your own life 
experiences give you sort of informed views on things. 

A: No, I don™t care to become a great commentator at the age of 85 years, concerning 

all kinds of domestic affairs. I think o-others 
can do a lot better job of that than I can. I 
think that the election in Germany, of the ne
w Prime Minister is a -- an indication that 
there is still more attention being paid in Eu
rope to international affairs. His election I 
think, like the election of Tony Blair in Grea
t Britain, is la -- is mo re encouraging, 
because I think it will strengthen NATO and st
rengthen adherence to international law 
and treaties. I think it will lead to more
 crossing the boundaries with respect to 
reaching people who violate international 
law and commit atrocities. As I think I 
pointed out before, the -- under Cole, as -- as well as I think under the new Premier, 

Germany will not be in the background, 
with respect to taking the lead on 
strengthening interna
tional law and NATO. 
Q: How do you think your own views have changed with time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 
 
32
 
 
 
A: Nuremberg was an extension in intern
ational affairs of some of the ethical 
principles that had been ground into me for 
many years before that. So I didn™t feel I 
was moving into new territory with respect 
to decency and ethics, etcetera. I knew I 
was moving in -- into new territory with re
spect to getting international structures 
made, which could begin to deal with some 
of the things which were -- which need to 
be handled on an international basis. 

Q: What are you proudest of? 

A: Well, I™m of course proudest of having se
rved in Nuremb erg for four years, and for 
having been editor in chief of the 15 Green volumes, called, ﬁTrials of War 

Criminals,ﬂ before the Nuremberg military 
tribunals. I suppose that™s what I™m most 
proud of. I hope I™ll similarly be proud of th
is book, but we have to see about that. 
Q: Well, that™s part -- that™s in a sense 
a natural progression. But did you have a sense 
that -- that your parents were immensel
y proud of you and what
 you™d accomplished? 
Did they understand the -- the significance, do you feel, at the time of their deaths? 

A: I think my parents were very proud of th
e fact that I received some recognition for 
my work at Nuremberg, and that I had 
become a supergrade and a Deputy Chief 
Council, but we didn™t talk too mu ch about 
those kinds of things. We talked about m-
many mo re local things that were of importa
nce in Wisconsin and my  father and I took 

fishing trips in Canada, and we played golf together and enjoyed each other, but we 

didn™t engage in a tremendous na -- amount
 of discussion about my  past. They 
obviously were proud of some of the things 
I™d done, but we didn™t talk mu ch about it.
