RALPH CODIKOW 
April 20, 1990 
 
Q: Would you tell me  your name  please? 
 

A: My name  is Ralph Codikow. 

 

Q: Where and when were you born? 

 

A: I was born April 9th, 1930, in Kovno, Lithuani
a and lived in Panemon, Lithuania all my 
life until I was 11 years old. 
 

Q: Where is Panemon in relation to Kovno? 

 

A: Panemon is on the outskirts of Kovno. 

 

Q: Ralph, would you tell me about 
your parents and about your family? 
 

A: Well, we were an average fa mily in L
ithuania before the war and...uh...my father, mo ther 
and a brother. I had a brother who was 7 years 
older than I was. And my father was in the 
–lumber business and lived there with his fa
ther, grandfather that I know oflived in 

Lithuania. Before that I don't know. 
 

Q: Okay. What was your childhood like growing up? 

 
A: Well, it was a pretty happy childhood. I went 
to eider when I was a
bout 6 years old, then 
at 7 I went to Hebrew gymnasium which 
is a high schoot until about–until I was about 
10 years old. And then in 1940... 
 
Q: Hold it one second. Before we get to 1940, 
tell me a little bit about...uh...the friends you 
had, the things you did duri
ng the day as a child. 
 

A: Well, it was...it was an average life. We 
had a...we lived in a nice town. Panemon was a 
small community. It consisted of one long 
street with a few alleys. And it was the 
gateway to which were...were summer ho
me t3 B for the people who lived in Kovno. 
They used to come  over to spend their weeke
nds in the woods and th
e forests where they 
had built summer home s. Also 
was real close by and it was beautiful beach and we used 
to spend our weekends there and it was real 
nice before the war. And then in 1940, when 
the Russians took over Lithuania..*uh...we didn'
t have any more Hebrew schools and we 
had to go to Yiddish schools and that's  wh
en we s t arted g ~ learning Yiddish. I think 
Hebrew was outlawed or some thing. And I studi
ed there for 1 year in a different school 

until the Germans ca me  i n. And...well...uh...we c
ould talk a little bit...uh...about that one 
year.

Q: Ya. Tell us about that.  Well, uh my  father
 had to leave his business because uh    you 
couldn't be a businessman under the      Russi
an regime , and he tried to get a job several 
times and had difficulties because he didn't belong to any party, and he was not involved 
in politics. And being...having been
 in business before the wa r, it was a little difficult to 
get a job. So we kind of struggled through that
 year, but it wasn't  too bad. We ma de it. 
And...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took ove
r, that's  when all Hell broke loose, 
so to speak. Uh...First of all, I reme mber 
like it was yesterday. It was on a Sunday 
morning. And I had sat up until 4: 00 in th
e morning making some names for my...for 
my...for the uniforms of my 
basketball team. I wa s about 
14years and I was...at 4:00 in 
the morning when I was extremely tired I went
 to bed. And at 6:00 
in the morning, I was 
woken and told that the Germany invaded Russi
a and they'r e going to be in our town any 
day, the German ar my, a nd we have to leave because that ma y save our lives. So we had 

a horse and wagon.  My father...uh...got it all 
together and we packed some of our 
belongings and took all...took 
my ...well, my whole fa mily which consisted of my 
brother, my mother and my father and also
 my grandfather from my
 mother's side. And 
we just started toward Russia.  Uh...We...I
 don't reme mber exactly how long it took us...a 

day or so to get to a small 
town. I believe that town was where my father was born and I 
think it was name d–I 'm not really very sure
. And that is when the Germans me t us and 
the border was closed, and there was no need to
 go any further. So we walked into the 
first abandoned home we found, probably was 
a Jewish home, other people who ran 
away, and we decided to stay overnight and 
see what happens the next day. And in the 
meanti me, I reme mber...uh...a few hours late
r, we  heard some  knocks on the doors, 

vicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they we
re looking for Jewish people I believe. 
They were ye lling ther e were any Jews hidi
ng here and naturally, we admitted that we 

were Jewish. So I reme mber they were
 kind of...a little vul
gar and then they 
asked...uh...what time it was. One incident, and 
my brother kind of being proud of his Bar 
Mitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch 
and told him what time  it was.  They 
said, "Well, give me  that watch immediately."
 And my brother kind of resisted, so when 
the Germans start pulling up his rifle, my 
mother went over grabbed his wa tch...grabbed 
my brother's watch and just handed it over real
 fast. And this was our first introduction to 
the German army Then the next day, I beli
eve, we  saw that there was no use to hang 
around. There was no use to stay in that l
ittle town. We  still ha d our horse, our wagon 
and some  of our belongings and we headed back home  back to Panemon, through Kovno. 

On the road, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where 

they intercepted all the refugees who had tr
ied to leave and tried and kept them...stopped 
all of us and told us to move over to that particul ar, big huge pl ace it was on the road. 

And they just kept us there for no reason at 
all. We...we spent a few nights there I believe 
outside on the ground, sky. It wasn't  too bad. 
It wasn't  cold...cold. It was summertime. 
And no...no one knew what the future's  going to
 bring. But after that I reme mber...I 
believe that they took us to the Seventh or
 drove us to the Seventh the whole family. 
Exactly I don't re me mbe r  how it happened, but
 I reme mber that our next stop was the 
Seventh Fort in Lithuanian.  
 

Q: Tell us about the Seventh Fort. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299

A: Well, the Seventh port was, I believe, an ar
my base before the war. It ma y have been 
some kind of a military defense area or something like that, but it was pr etty       
green...pretty and they separated imme diatel
y the me n and the wome n. Uh...I reme mber 
that my brother was 7 years older than I wa
s, and when my grandfather we nt with my 
father on my  one side, and my mother and I
...they took us in another area of the Seventh 
Fort. I was 11 years old at that time. And 
we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of 
days...I don't reme mber how ma ny days we spent there, but I...I reme mber that right 

before they took us to the Ninth Fort, a
nd the Ninth Fort was a similar place as the 
Seventh Fort in Lithuania, they had 
given them an order to some  of the 
younger...uh...younger people who were with the 
meant to...to go to the wo men's side, 
and I...some one told you...that I think the orde
r was that all the child
ren up to about 15 or 
16 could go to the wome n's side and my 
brother tried to go over. I don't know, he 
probably thought ma ybe it is safer and 
my father ma y have told him to do 
60.And...uh...they didn't let hi m through because they
 said he looked older. Actually, he 
was 18. And he looked older, and they 
didn't let him in...let him go to–to–uh...his 
mother. And...and right after that we heard a
nd knew that everyone was shot over there. 
All the me n were shot, but my father was not 
there. This is anothe
r long story. My father 
was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army. I be
lieve when Lithuania in 1916 or some thing 
like that, he volunteered in th
e Lithuanian army to defend the...the country.  And while 
Lithuania was independent between 1916 and 
I believe1940, these volunteers took a in 
certain prominent Close Lithuanian life. Th
ey were ...and they were honored ma ny times. 
My father had me dals of it, and we were pr
etty proud of it. Uh...So 
before they told all 
the youngsters or after to go to another side
, to the wome n's side, they also announced 
that everyone who was...they 
called themselves and those 
are volunteers. Every ma n who 
was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to 
present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh., 
soldiers who probably did the ma ssacre afterwar
ds, and that they would take them out of 
there. And indeed, they did. They took th
em to a different place, which was called 
the...the Yellow Prison. They called it the 
Yellow Prison in Kovno. And I know that my 
father was there. So at that time  my father
 was not shot. It was 
only my brother and my 
grandfather. Then the–and....uh...my  father 
was...uh...in that prison I remember. And 
later on when we were released from th
e Ninth Fort, after be
ing there...uh...and...uh...my 
father came home  one day and...uh...he...we asked 
him how he did that. He was in prison. 
And he said he had promised the guard offi
cers uniform and boots if he would let him go 
to see his family. He said, "Well, I'll let 
you go, but you better be b
ack."And my father 
came to visit us.  He spent a few hours with 
us and my mother begged him, I reme mbe r  

that. She begged him not to go back because
 it's not going to be there very good place. 
We knew about that.  And...uh...he did go bac
k, and...uh...they were shot over there also. 
They were shot. We  hea r d all kinds of stor
ies.  Who knows why?  But, we really don't 
know why. We really hoped and thought that 
being...being Xo the volunteers they were 
and respected before the war, the Lithuani
an army who really directed mo st of 
these...uh...I don't know how to      call 
it...uh...would...would really let them free, but 
they didn't. Uh...well, after...after th
is, we...uh...went to the ghetto. They...when the 
orders came , they told the Jews have to 
leave their towns...their towns and home s and 

belongings. Well, not all the belongings, 
but...uh...that you couldn't 
take with you and 
move to that designated area around Kovno wh
ich was called the ghetto. And my mother 
and I...we just took the things that we had. 
Couldn't ...tried to exchange our home with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
4 
 
some  Lithuanians, but I guess we just we
re not successful. So me  people did. Some  
people gave up big ma ns ions for little hom
es, and...uh...they moved in there, but there 
was not enough room for everyone so they...pe
ople who had those homes took in their 
fa milies, thei r fr iends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing. I and my mother, we 
shared a room with a neighbor of ours 
who...uh–was...we were close before the war 
and...uh...that lady had also lost her son and 
her husband, and her daughter, who was my 
brother's age and I think they were frie
nds...uh...had a room that they acquired some how 

from some  r e latives or friends in one of t
hose houses, and they took us in and we...shared 
one room, the four of us. 
 

Q: Can you...can you go back. You had told me  befo
re that while your father was in prison 
your mother had taken his papers and tried to do some thing? 
 

A: Yes. We ll...well, my mo ther alwayscher
ished papers, a being the, that volunteers–and 
his me dals. And that was...we tell that was a 
precious thing because most of the...most of 
our encounter all the mi sfortunes that 
we had until then were always cause d by 
Lithuanian soldiers. And we didn't see th
at ma ny Germans around at the beginning. I'm 
sure they gave all the orders. They were
 involved. But I we didn't see them. So we 

felt...she felt especially that those papers
 and medals may come in handy someday. She 
always kept them on her. Uh...We ll
...there's  so much to talk about– 
 

Q:  You had gone ahead and you are in the ghetto now? 

 

A: Yes, I'm in the ghetto now. But...uh...there 
was another incident that if I ma y I should 
back up a little but that's always stuck with
 me  too is when...when the Russians came  in, 
although we were not in great shape financia
lly either, but my fa
ther since he was a 
volunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some –for the Lithuanian 

Ar my...for the Lithuanian army before
 the war. And he was friendly with 

some ...uh...people in high command. And he find 
out where we lived there a general who 
was I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuani
an army and when the Russians came in they 
sent him to Siberia.  And...and he had left 
his wife  and children in our town, and my 
father knew them.  And I  reme mber that wh
enever he could, he used to take some  
packages over there or even lumber to heat
 the ho mes because in Lithuania most of the 

home s were heated by lumber, good lumber. 
And he...he was quite friendly with them 
and tried to help that particular year. A
nd right after the Germans occupied Lithuania 
right before the ghetto, we were
 sitting in this lady's house,
 Mrs. Mudrick was her name , 
and...uh...just talking about the future in the ghe
tto and things like that, where we'r e going 
to move home s or what ever and I...I looke
d  through the window. 
It, it was about two 
houses away from ours in Panemon, and I 
looked through the window and here was the 
General walking with his wife and was going back to their home  in the...on the–They 

lived...they had a home in the 
outskirts of Panemon. And I 
kind of felt a great feeling 
because I felt this is one ma n who probably 
could help release my father from that 

Yellow prison that he wa s in. And I pointed 
her out to my mother
, "Look who's walking 
by here. Wh y don't you go out and talk to him really quickly. I'm sure he knows us. 

Especially–she knows us, and ma ybe they can 
do some thing," my mother went out real 
quick.  I was with her and I reme mbe r  that 
for a mi nute they acted like...like–they didn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
5 
 
even know us or pretended anyway. And...uh...she told them who we were and they 
nodded and she begged them to see if they
™ll–can do some thing about releasing my 
father. But needless to t say, not
hing happened.  That is one inci
dent that stayed with me . 
Uh...Alright, I guess now the ne
xt thing is the ghetto. 
 

Q: Tell us again which ghetto you were
 in and how did you get there?   
 

A: Well, from what I remember it was quite 
simple. We  just walked or...or took a bus or 
something. I really don't reme mber exactly 
how we got there. Maybe on a wagon?  No, I 
cannot. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I know th
at we were there in 1941, and I was11 years 

old with my mother and she had arranged to li
ve in that room with Mrs. Wi drick and her 
daughter, Rita. 
 

Q: You are not in Ka
unas. You are in Kovno. 
 

A: Well, Kaunas and Kovno is the same  thing. Ka
unas is in Lithuania. Uh, well, from the 
beginning, I reme mber there was Aktions. Th
ey called for 500 people, and they called 
four thousand people to work, 
and they called for all kinds of things. And some  ca me  
back, some people didn't come back, but thos
e things did...did not affect me  personally 
because, as I said, you know, being young, you...you don't 
understand a lot of things. I      
12 know...my...my mother used to go to work 
every day in a brigad
e. I don't re me mbe r  
exactly what she was doing and, but then we
 tried...we tried our 
best to survive. 
 

Q: Did you see any of the roundups? 

 

A: Uh...Not, not exactly. I seen a 
lot of roundups. I seen a     
 lot of brigades going in and 
out, but...uh...there      we ren't...I could not
 distinguish between the ones who went and 
came back and the ones who went and didn't come back.  Uh   I was a go-for when I was 

about 12, 13 years old, I became a go-for fo
r the admi nistration in the ghetto–running 
around with papers, back and forth to o
ffices–And...uh...I thought ma ybe...I really don't 
reme mber what I was thinking. I...I was 
just doing what I was told to do,  
After–and–and that's it.  When I was about 14 
I believe, I started to work in a...in a 
clay factory where weQ 5 * 2 used to ma nuf
acture pottery, clay...out of clay. And that 
factory was run by afami l y of qenerations of
...of pottery ma kers, and they were very 
experienced and dida ve
ry beautiful job.;5 ft 
 

Q: Okay. Let's just pause. We need
 to change tapes.AtZ < e Xtal  
 

Q: Tell us about your >**ning.- < > Qvlve I t(a ew13 

 

A: Well...uh...so, I was doing some  running for that place,      running around, delivering to 
the pottery, and also trying      to help out with
 the clay, kneading clay and so on and so      
t     forth. A   a very important uh    part of
 my life happened      in that factory. When I 
worked there, I'm sure that's whenX the... 
F st of the people know about the children's 
aktionSwhich was the selecti
on of the young children whomt hey...they picked out from 
the ghetto and took to the Ninthb ffi rt
 and killed them all over there.

As...as...uh...weheard, I was...the day they hAd that
 selection, I was at
 thepottery, at the 
ceramic factory. And I guess the boss orthe leader
 of that factory had heard that there's 
ata selection...they're rounding up all the children. We ll, hewas kind of concerned about 
me ...uh...and he said, "Well, wegonna...since 
they'r e rounding up children we'r e going 
to;:ao put you to work and ma ke you look impor
tant. So let's seeif...what we can do about 

it." I don't know...I don't  knowif I understood wh
at was happening, what our destiny 
was,but he all of a sudden put me  ne xt to hi
s old uncle who wast 9 
@t the best pottery 
ma ker, a real artist, and he put me  rightnext
 to him to knead...knead the clay to prepare 
the clay ..for him to put on that machine and he was ma king the pots and vases and things 

likethat. And I reme mbe r  two~3 ;6tUkrainian
 soldiers walked in. They looked around. 
They didn't see any children untilthey spotted me . And they walked up to me  and they 

said, "How old are you?" And 1      14 be
lieve I said, "I was a
bout 14." Maybe I was 15. 
Maybe I was 14." And onesaid to me , "Come with
 us." Wellt Ir3 ;au di dn't move that fast. 
I just kept on working, and the other one l
ooked at me  andsaid, "Aw, let him stay." "Oh 
no." "Let him go. Let him go. Come  on. Come  
on." AndWz Ssthen the...the boss, Ske 
name  i~ Nic holas, and he intervened      o  
   and said, "Well, this is a real good worker 
and we need him            here. n And he said, 
"Okay, let's leave him here. wJ And the            
second one insisted that I stay, a
nd they walked away and      t     this is how I rema ined 
that timt and   uh    this was an0 4 60i
mportant...uh...event, that clay factory. I think 
stayed in the clay factory untilthe evacuati
on to the concentration camps in Germany. But 
I think before that...beforethe clay fact
ory, we had a very importantO<ab Aktion...an 
incident happened. And that was what they 
called the big Aktion, th
ebig selection where 
this particular day the German commandant
 selected 10,000 peopleO4 4b and they were 

all exterminated in one day in the Ni nth Kort
. And this is quite a story.Uh...They told us 
to present ourselves at 6:00 in the morn
ing at a certain place intheghetto. The 
whole...everyone...whoever would stay behind 
..O $ tt would be shot, and naturally 
everybody showed up. They...they put everybody in thegates...and some  type of Jewish 

police and...uh...and the leaders of th
e ghetto triedto keep some  ki
nd of order, so as to try 
to present us in Io S ;=b guess a better light, 
and so not to upset the Germans, you      15 
know, when...when we walked in front of them. I reme
mber            walking up in front of 
the German Gestapo me n with my mother         
   1 ox c 1t      06  
  s ~\1. and he asked my 
mother questions, says , "No            me n? " And my mother said, "No." And he says, 

Well, he            pointed to the right. 
And as he pointed to th
e right, Iog 61D knew right 
then and there that was death. That wa s the 
end      of us. And...uh...I reme mber we 
started crying and we      started worryi
ng. And...uh...my mot her told me  in the      
convoys, "Don't worry. We 'll be back. We  r 
re not going toU D go anywhere." And I 
thought she's really out of her mi nd. And...uh..~
because that wasunheard of. Once they 
decided some thing, there's no co
mi ng back. And...uh...she toldme ,# 
 she said...we 
had...we had a friend...and this is another story. We had a friend,Lithuanian, before the 

war who was a German-Jew, a refugee from 
Germany. And he usedto come  over to our 
house and be friendly with us, with my 
parents. And he in 1940,was = out by the 
Russians as a O8 ; 4 olitical prisoner. He 
escaped, came back toLithuanian, and had some  
papers as if..if he was some political pris
oner and againstcommunism. And he was in 
ghetto. We  knew that.o7 aO We  us ed to see h
im. And she told me , " We 're going to me et 
him on this side, andtogether with his papers
 and our papers, we'r e going to come  back." 
My father'sme dals...what I was talking about. 
"We 're going to come  back." And again, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299

I...Ididn't...I didn't know what to      a    
 think. I thought my mother
 had lost her sind right 
there.      4;rS; oF ll \ tt~i~lL h. To
 find him on the wrong side since he was, 
poFtiswbartywas I think a single person. I don'tthink he had his familyO g a anymore. 
Well, to shorten it, they took us down about, 
oh, 50 yards or 100 yards ina different place 
after we were selected on the right si
de which was the wrong sideand...uh...they were 
waiting for more people to come  and when th
ey had a certainamount...on that side they 
usedot:2~ to...they took us into
 the little ghetto. And that is
 different...altogetherdifferent 
story about the little ghetto. We ll, as we were
 standing ther e and waitingto be taken to the 
little ghetto, I spotted that ma n standingt 
about 10 yards from us and said to my mother, 
"Here he is just like you 8aid." And shesays, 
"Run over to him and tell him to come  over 
and stay with us." And I did. Andhe kind of wo
rked his way to us. My mother asked him, 
"How did you get over here? " We
ll, I tried to save a lot 
of people,O 9'6~ children, 
and...and the commandant wouldn't even listen 
to me . He just put us on thewrong side 
and here we are." And he was just as scared
 and just as weak as I was.My motherW) S 
4t«Oq Lao said, "Let's stay together. Wsw'
ra going with UL,J~ We ll, we went to the 
littleghetto which was empty, which was...whi
ch was exterminated before and as we 
camethere...uh...there...uh...10,000 people were there 
at night.t5,+t Ten thourand people 
were selected. And some  thought that they ma y 
just separate usfrom the big ghetto and let 
us stay there and ma ybe live or do other things. 
So sone      17 people tried to get their 
home s and get some  beds to be ableD 9 to sl
eep on or whatever was left from the people 
who were there before. And my mothersai
d, "We're not looking for no houses. We  a r e 
not going to look for any furniture.We don't need anything. We want to come  back to the 

ghetto. n¢: ao Because she doesntt like the s
ituation here. So as she saidwe picked one 
house right...right by the gate. I reme mber   
   \>;«d~S ~ that we found some  berrivie 
room and there was an oldmattress...ma ttre
ss on which Mr. h was his name , Mr. R*6tu~ 
and I laid down and sleptand my mother sat 
in aqD lounge chair all 
night long and I thin 
S tt8>, M# ,r Jke aOlr some thing. And ever
ytime I woke up I coul
d see her sitting, not 
sleeping at all. At 6:00 in
 the morning,5:00,Xl~O-D 6:00 in the morning, we heard bang 
g r~yelling, screaming, insults, dragging 
people.We ran out and we saw already 
some ...uh...r ows of humanity being taken I thlnk 
in theXl aj) directi
on of the Ninth Fort 
which we knew...which street led to the Ninth 
Fort. Andas we were in the line in front, 
almost by the gate, my mother decided, she said,"We ll, now      ttr. X h we'r e goinq to try 

to come  back." She said, "Ba , give/{ 4t me  your papers." And she took the me dals and 

my father's .. paper and she ran up to oneL
ithuanian officer and told him that...pretended 
that Mr. Raston was her husband an
dsaid that he was a political 
prisoner, that he was a , a 
volunteer before the war,that he did some  
good things forXD Lithuania«, and would he 
help us in...in sending us back to      i8
 the big ghetto. We ll, one...one said, "Well, don't 
worry wherever you'regoing you're going to be working. You're...you're just going to 

change places. Itwon't be/; ;UD muc h differe
nt." And she went to another one. Another 
one wouldn't even listen toher. The third one
 said I could not do anything about it, until 
Mr. iesCcn and I kindof gave up and told herl "Let
's ...let's  go where everyone else goes."      
/ ;   And  uh    she said, "One more." She sa
w     she spotted thislieutenant, Lithuanian 
lieutenant, and she walked up to hima nd she kind
 of with her last breath tried to explain 
the} 3 ' 6
 situation. And he said to her, "Look, 
I cannot do anything ab
out it, but...but 
theGerma n commandant is going to come  over 
in a few mi nutes and rsached...he took us 
andhe put us on the sidewalk, rather than in
 the streets. And he said, ~You stay here

andwhen the German commandant come s, we'r e 
going to present to him these papers and 
seewhat he can do} 3 aU3 about it." And that fe
lt very tood at that mo me nt except that 
about a mi nute later,some  soldier walked up, L
ithuanian soldier, and he saw us standing 
on...on thesidewalk, not where everyone else wa
s standing. And he had, 3: q O a club in 
his hand and without any question he smacked
 Mr. ..9*6ten on his ear and split hi s ear 
and...uh...my mother on her back, black and blue
ma rks on he r back, and told us to get 
back in the row with all the other people. A
tthat time # ffi that officer noticed it and he 
came over and he said to him, "Look, Itold them to st
ay here and I want them to stay here      
19 and don't touch them." A mi nute later the 
German appeared, the Germancommandant. 
And the way it was situated was like/  4 ag3 th
is. The gate of the small ghetto was the end 
of one street. The whole thinghappened...the
 way it happened was like a interception 
from which four or fivestreet
s...streets branched out. The German comma ndant wastX 4O 
standing in the mi ddle of th
e interception. The gate was 
on one street. About 90degrees 
of that gate was the fence of the big ghetto 
from which we had come . No gate.3ust barbed 
wire fence with Germa n guards and the Jewi
sh policea ff n an the other side of it, 
pretending to watch what'shappening or to guard
 or whatever they were doing there. a»a 
Xs      Probably seeing what was happ
ening. knothes German was J b SLt standing 
there,the lieutenant ran ove
r quickly, took the me dal the papers, and walked over to 
theGerma n commandant and he talked to hi
w. What he said I don't know, but I heard 
theGerma n yell, "Where are those Jews?  Wh
ere are those Jews? "  So he ran...he came 
overquickly and got us and...uh...my mother wa
lked up to him quickly and told...ff 4O 
repeated her story, and he said, "Back in th
e ghetto." And we coul
d see...before I gotto 
the fence, I could see the 3ewish police...the
re wa s no entrance, but the Jewishpolice16; 
65r who were on the other side tore the barbed
 wi re with their hands and their feet,tore 
apart...made a hole, and we just cr
awled back in. And...uh...that day 10,000people 
died.sUD One of the nen who vent was a cousin 
who we really hadn't      20 seen, but we 
learned afterwards that she was there. A
nd...uh...this is, Iguess, how we survived that 
one.g q p But...uh...it just worked out exactly the 
same  way my  mother      ~1,ß,~8 zr ~ 
predicted. - ~ . Probably one in a million. From
 what I understand is thatthere ma y have 
been a few othersIn C~) who hid in attics or
 some other pl aces that day inst ead of going 
to the Ninth Fort,and I think when some body to
ld me  afterwards...whe
n the Jewish police 
and the fireme nca me i io check they found some
 people hidden and later got them out of 
there. Theybrought over uniforms and they dr
essed n a>Dthem up as policemen and they 
just gotthem back in. I      FaP S>
ftdon't think there was very ma ny, but I know 
that...uh...thatAo*WenQwe came ba ck, we were the only ones.O  
 

Q: Where did you go?  What happened to you? 

 

A: Well, we went back to our place, to
 our...where we lived 
in the ghetto and we 
continuedthe ghetto life and actually the  
    Ats ktt ß e atD children's aktion 
and...uh...was after...after tWz nd they would go 
outcontinue living in the ghetto until the 
evacuation. 
 

Q: And did you see the children?  The children aktion th
at you had described earlier? >      }

A: Yes. And    uh   the ghetto kept on shrinking a
ll the time ,21            less and less people. 
And even the area was reduced and I            believe in 44 when the Russian army got 
closer to Lithuania,      X     for s
one reason and just evacuated us and took us to 
theconcentration camp. But before that ha
ppened...uh...peoplewere trying...trying to build 
some  bunke rs~ They werecalled bunkers, whic
h were hiding pl*ces
. They kind of5 C1D 
expected that some  day when the war was ove
r that theGermans would not leave a trace 
of U8. SO they builtbunkersX And in that cerami c factorA there was a bunker.And 

actually I...I forgot to me n
tionXmy mother was hidden in; 
q that bunker in the cerami c 
factory. And...uh...from what Iunderstand Gb*Ae 
was later that...when they evacuated 
theghetto and some  of the people stayed in th
e bunker, they;4 D just put the whole...they 
just put a fire to the ghetto andthey burn
ed everything and everyone in there. And I 
don'tknow if any people survived that day. 
But I know there wassome  pe ople hidden in 
this bunker. They had it prepareda ~: r real 
well. They pretended they were building a 

furnace...afurnace...0 oven for the ceramic because you had to take it      utsst Dv 15 iZq 

and burn it. And that was the ; fEceceee l1ve
 in-the big bunker. AndI think I know...I 
think I heard that one of my           
 aunts also was in one of those bunkers and she 
disappeared      ffi
   right afterw~>~ 
 

Q: What was life likeAfor you in the ghetto?22 

 

A: Well, it all depends. It all depends. It was 
different for all people. For me 7 We ll,when I 
was working...running a ^ so around and working, it wasn't  that bad. Matteroffact...uh...I 

even had a chance to pl ay soccer in the tc~_ a l 6mb ghetto. I had a Pt5Bt.I had some  

friends. We  for med a soccer team. We
 played there among ours Qlvesand...uh...and 
...uh...as a matter of fact, I had a good friend w
ho was the captain of our team. He was 
studying at that time ...incidently, we had a...I
 believe an arts school in a o . a O the 
ghetto. And that arts school 
consisted of about four or 
five students, one or Mwo 
\teachers. And...uh...they were0 iC OC c .1 < 9 0 (o o ~ ag=wsug some  veedbeSteatA 
training. And one of the friend of ~ine heard th
at we were studying in
 this arts school and 
IQ l qb reme mber waiting for me  and rushing him to get out of school so we  could have a 

little more time  to play and...uh...later on this 
arts school played another big part in my 

life. Uh...Otherwise I really 
don't reme mber too much. It was>;L ~nb just routine every 
day. I reme mber one incident when my mother
 went to work and she took me  with...with 
her because she got a chance to go to home
 ~ in Panemon because the brigade was 
working there for...I don't  know who...theQ;
 g D military or so mebody. And I reme mb ert 
we went and came to our hometown and we walked into the barracks, the military 

barracks which was situated behind a home acr
oss the street from our house. And the 
people across the street from ouraa +~ house we
re Lithuanians, very good friends of ours. 
They had      23 a restaurant and I 
reme mber walking through...uh...I think she had 
ma de...Ithink Oer mothe r  ~w walkeda 3 crD through several time s and there was a board 

in the fence that was loose, especially ma de
 I think for my mother
 to go over the board 
and walk through to their backyard and into
 their home. And I reme mber those people 
real well. Weofl v se>4 M *v R» s aUL walked through there and we walked up nnd 

otood boforc this restaurant and I reme mber that
 lady was there, Mrs. , friends before the 
war. They were very nice to me . Andused to 
be our friends before the war, her sons, and 
even made one time at iaSi~ r;*S forme, ams
ttk , a very small one. It was very cold. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299

they poured water, used toa3 q b freeze them
 within an hour. And they were good friends 
of ours. And I reme mber that they kind of 
helped us a little bit with some  food. I 
reme mber when my mother used to come back
 from that job, I reme mber we ate pretty 
good. This was      Q     a ma id sharing this food. I reme mber during my     during my  stay 
in the ghetto, in the concentr
ation camp, most of thetime I 
spent thinking about this food 
more than anythingelse. I don't think I wa6 that
 scared to die or anythingaW No else, just 
tried to get some  food just to feel better..T
hat...that I reme mb er. Is
 there anything else. 
After this... 
 

Q: You are back in the ghetto. What happened to you? 24ad: 5 t 

 

A: Well. To me ?  Nothing that...nothi
ng that I can reme mberl XtAte c
J^
V~c- 't s MoR 
r      
. The big aktionQ I believe I ~\; J 13 was 
12 years old. i~_S*«S, I even had my Bar 
Mitzvah in the ghetto. Ye s. I reme mber that . We  had (laughing) we had some  other 

friends who were also Ge rman refugees who 
came  to tSo; & live in Panemon in B~ d 

right before the Germans occupied. 
 

Q: Let's hold it a mi nute. They need to change tapes.      j 3CX5 3rn  

 

Q: Would you tell us about your 
fa mily«?  g 0w_ xt5<~1 t7  
 

A: Prom what I reme mber was this. There were no 
schools in the      sc
hool in the ghetto. If 
there were any, I didn't know      about it. Uh...We had some  friends as I said who came      

from...who a l so were German-Jewish refugees who came to live      ol ; l in Panemon and 

my parents became friends of theirs. And     
 they were religious people, very religious 
people,      and...uh...tbere were all the Jewish 
traditions and so      Ol~ q O forth. They 
also ma de it to the ghetto. And I reme mber  
    when I was about 12, 12 and a half, my 
mother...uh...said      that this 
gentlema n...I forgot his name ...would te
ach me  the            
Sa orah and everything that one needs to know to 
have a Bar      o     Mitzvah. So every 
day he used to come  over. I used to go      
      over to his place and we would study4*F1 I 
don't re me mber how long, but...uh...but by the time
 the day of the Bar Mitzvah came , I 
reme mber there was a house and there were25D z ; D quite a fe w people, 10, 20 and I 

reme mber the wome n being in d,~ the back
 and...uh...they were styihq their Saturday 

prayerd g ust like in th
e normal time s, and when it came to my paronks I reme mber that I 
think I did fairly well with myuL ~<      
~ . And one thing I can reme mber that day, I had 
neverO)'457 seen my mo ther cry so hard a
nd that day, it was...it was I remember it was 
impossible to stop her. Although> @; a after
...after the Bar Mitzvah, they had a little 
party.Whoever had anything brought over, and we
 ma naged to03 a 3 celebrate. That was 
one incident I reme mber clearly.And...uh.*.in 
the ghetto every day life, work and we 
heard, of course, all kind of incidents. If I we
re to go to very day life, there was a hanging 
in the ghetto that I reme
mbero 3;%5 clearly because...uh...uh...one...they...they claime d 
they found in fact, one of the inma tes with a 
revolver or a pistol 
trying to smuggle into 
the ghetto.      &     And  uh    natura}ly the 
Gestapo apprehended him            and  uh we 
were ordered everyone was orde
red to appear in one place. And the gallows were all 
prepared ~ They brought him back. I reme mber having seen him comi ng out of the = all 

beaten up, swollen, hardly recognizable, and I ..  
    O     reme mber the hanging incident. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
11 
 
was ma ybe 12, 13 watching through a window b
ecause...uh...they had  him $4; a pistol or 
something. And I believe because of that...the 
# +O ghetto ha d to sacrifice a lot of people 
for him beca use they wanted to punish US and 
took some  innocent people and just      
26Wt g t3 did kill them Xe=roTth of that in
cident . It was not...it was not pleasant. You 
had to move from place to place. As they were
 shrinking the ghetto, we had to move fr om 
place to place. And...uh...tried to do the best...mak
e the best of it. I am sure that there 
were a lot of other incidents th
att6 '2 thappened. I'll probably th
ink of them later, but right 
now I cannot think of them. 
 
Q: What happened then?  Do you reme mber?  90 

 

A: Well, when...when they evacuated us. We  were
 one of the last ones to be evacuated, to 
Germany, to the concentration camps. They took 
us in a train. We traveled to Germany. I  
don't know. I don't reme mber how long it was. But I reme mb er comi ng to Stutthof and     

uh   and they separated the wome n fr om the me n and...uh...kept the wome n in the 

Stuffhof camp some place around Stutthof and the me n they took to Landsberg. 

Landsberg was a...was the first stop in      
t     Germany. That was a concentration camp. 
A s mall one I            believe not far from M
unich and not far from Dachau. And I            
reme mber being separated with my mother 
already and I justO G qocontinued with the 
trains to deeper into Germany. And that    
  is the last time I heard of my mother until 
after the war.      I had some  people who were wi
th her and told me  that she      died in the 
last days of the war. The exact details th
ey      O 5 CDnever told me , but...uh...probably 
for some  reason probably            27 not 
to upset me  or other things, but the exact way I 
don't know, but I know she...she died in the 
last days. And...uh...I came to Landsberg, and 
there were a lot of me n, young me n and older me
n. And we stayed there not too long, and 

they ordered all the children up to 17 year
s old to q O assembl e  and...uh...and they took 
us away. They took us away to...to Dachau. We  were about 131 I believe, and we stayed 
in Dachau for 1 week and then they shippe
d us out to Birkenau, Auschwitz, Birkenau. 
And...uh...when we came to Birkenau.... 
 

Q: Tell us about that ride.Ot  

 

A: Well, the ride to Birkenau. We  were...we were
 put in three      wagons, three railroad 
wagons, train wagons, 131 of us and      D   
  we   we were stopping someplace. The only 
thing I really reme mber from that ride is th
at we came to a place in a train station where 
some  Russian prisoners were able to walkup 
to our train and there were some  port holes 
in our cattleOq # 513 trains and warned U5 to
 see and try to...try to
 escape if we could 
because...uh...they said if you are Jewish and you are ..      going to Auschwitz or 

Birkenau, that's  where they kill them Oq » D 
all. So if you have a chance, just run away. 
And some  of us couldn't . And it...it took quite
 a while to get there. And one incident I 
reme mber was that since we>q # O were all 
Lithuanian children th
at none of us spoke 
Polish so      28 to try to escape was usele
ss or we wouldn't know to talk or how to talk. 
Butin my...i n my wagon, there were two boys who 
did speak Polish, a little or a lot I don't 
know. I knew they knew some thing about it. And 
they told us that a they were going to 
jump and escape. Now, we had a big      dilemma because if they escaped and we knew 

from the ghetto      I b Qd if one did anythi
ng wrong, all of us would be done. So we      

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
12 
 
had a plan ma de up with them thst they...we 
would try      to...t
here were two older 
German gua rds in that train, and      we w
ould try to distract them to try...there were 
ma ybe 60      q O of us or 50 of US on th
at train, and we would 
try...there      was 
only...the wa s only ma de of about we were ma
ybe about 5 or 10 kids
 involved in that. 
And...uh...we said like this, that they'r e going to go
 through that port hole,      tnD try to 
climb down the step of the train and stay th
ere for awhile until ma
ybe the mome nt that 
the train sl ows down a little bit...I believe 
the train was going about ma ybe 40 miles an 
hour, 50 miles an hour, and when the train slow
 down and ma ybe in a brushy area where 
it would be softer...softer to land, they would 
try to jump. And to protect us because out 
of 50 kids some one had to see that they were
 jumping out and not to tell the Germans that 
would have been the end of every one of us. 
So we decided with them that they'r e going 
to jump and in about a couple of hours 
later, we would pretend...we would be 
about...and...100 miles away...l20 mi les away from 
that area...a couple 
of hours later, we 
would pretend that we just saw the kids jum
p, and we would tell the German guards that 
here two kids have jumped out and here they
 are. They'r e laying right here watching us. 
And...uh...maybe that would save 
us and...uh...in the meantime, Seli 
thit      w ^l; ;D - , 
they wouldn't ...they wouldn't even look fo
r them that far away and...uh...maybe they 
would. So we did itZ; q D that way. We...we t
ook four...four of us, starting talking to the 
Germans. They were kind of older and they were not from t he SS. They were from t he 
Wehr macht, so...so you could speak to them once in awhile. They would...I reme mbe r  

some one wa s talking to them about knives, a
bout other/3 61) things. I don't reme mber the 
conversation. About we were watching the hom
e s  or the greenery while the train was 
going by. We just talked to them and kept 
them busy. And all of a sudden, like we said, 
about two hours later, one kid ran up to us and started to pretend that he's  telling me  a?  

bao secret~ And they got excited and they 
asked whatts happened. We  sa id, "Go look 
quick. Quick. Through that window, the port hole, two kids just jumped out." First, they 
didn't believe it and then they kinda looked 
and then3 AO they said, "Well, it took you 
too long. They were right there." And thirdl
y, they started to ca
ll the officer some how 
and made some signs that we s
hould stop the train      reco+
blc and to recount them 
because if they took them to , we/ # 6lD we
re mi ssing. Now that took a little while. And 
they30stopped the train. They took us all out 
and they counted us three time s, and two 
were mi ssing. SO they...they asked us,Where di
d it happened. And they said, "About five 

mi nutes# dD ago, they all jumped out, and 
we reported it, we  saw it."And okay, from 
what I understand they did call 
the localpolice in that town, 
but that ma y have had been 
10towns...those kids were about 10 towns 
behind us...andthey...they were looking for 
them. What happened?  We don't know. But from 
what I heard lately, I think one...ne of/4 
4O them did survive. Some one told me  a story that one kid whenthey were transported 

from...uh...fr o m...uh...we  were goingto Buchenwald to
 Birkenau jumped the train. One of 
theLithuanian kids jumped the train, and he's
 some where iny 5 ; > 
Israel right now. And 
I'm trying to see if we can ma kecontact a
nd meet him. And...uh...that I learned recently 
ayear...maybe a few mo nths ago. So we then 
we came toAus c hwitz,- Birkenau. We  were 

led in. We  were kept for3 about 3 days 
in quarantine, and we didn't know why in 

abarrack with straw, not even a shower. 
Very little food.And we could see a lot of 
concerned inmates, old timers whoused to come 
in and out, in and out, talk to us, and ask 
usZ S q t questions. And we found out...out late
r, the reason westayed
 there about four 
days before letting us into thecamps is because this is the first transpor t of children 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
13 
 
whowere let into Birkenau alive. There were some  childrenyC CnD before who came  
with their father or families. When I say      31 children, 13, 14, 15. And we were the 

first...it was late in the wa r andthings had star
ted to change a little bit. So what happened, 
we don't really know.But they told us U aO 
later that...uh...they were
 very surprised and 
happy that wewere the first ones 
let in, and we were in quarantine in i      a...in a camp 
which was called A-lager, A-lager. WciL~ 
we /6 qO didn't doanything fr om...just looked 
for food. Tr y see what...uh...we could do.b...That's allwe thought about. There were hot 

days and cold days and all kinds of days.J
7;6t And I reme mbe r  after quarantiner they 
took us to a children's barrack in the...theD
-Lager, which was a working lager, working 

camp. They were a lot of kommandos,people wh
o used to go to work every day and come  
back. And we had those appells whereyou had 
to get up early in the morning, stand in 
that pl ace being counted day andnight, twice a da
y to ma ke sure that everyone of US was 
there. And at the beginningI didn't do anythi
ng there either. There was notn 4 D too much 

work for us, I believe. But there was one brig
ade that used to...tha
t usedto come  out of 
this barrack. And they were some  child
ren whopushed...uh...some...they called q K it a 
roll wagon....it looked like a...
like abuggy or like a horse a
nd buggy, without a horse and 
iVet collected garbage in some places in the 
camps and the crematoriums and things like 
that. That was not a bad jObcause when you 
u6ed to goI t aUDto some  of those places 
and being a child or young me n, you used to
 meet some  womenand older people who 
used to give      32d.%you some _share withatheir
 rations or bread or wh
atever they v      
had. But...uh...that was hard to 4 ve into unt
il one day, I%;~ O reme mber it was pouring 
rain, mud to your knees, and you hadto go and pu
sh that wagon. We ll, some of the kids 
who wereworking there before kind of hid 
or didn't  show up,/ 4 t6D and...uh...half way 
volunteering and half way being picked Igot 
into that job. And as I said before, ma ny 
days thathelped me  because people used to 
hand Fe some  things, foodand things like to 

eat, which wa s the most important thing/ 5 ;O 
in that time . We stayed there not very long, 
ma ybe a fe wmonths. The...the crematorium 
had quiet2 down...quietedD down from what 

I understand. They...they didn't exterminatepeople 
in those days as much as they did in 
the earlier daysuntil one day we woke up a
nd we did see all kind of fla mes going through 
those chimneys and we knew that's what's
 goingon. We  knew that they were burning 

people over there, but» 5 that
 day they...someone told us...I don't know how therumors 
started. They had rounded up about 3,000gypsie
s...gypsies and just took them to the 
crematorium andjust gassed them and burne
d them like they did...they did»D Q O the 
Jewish people. And that was...uh...kind of scar
ed.      ..Needless to say, also...now it's 
comi ng back to me ...uh.. Hthose A and D lagers, we we
re...we were...there were            » 
~ QO selections too. I almost forgot about thos
e. 9 e day we      4     were on the 
appellSplaNK where we were supposed to stand   
         every morning and evening and 

th- Ke--an K0 ~n~aNt KdR- b33      and he looked over. We ...I was in a children's 

barrack anda 1 ;n he looked us over, and...uh...I
 think that was before thatGypsy incident 
and he looked us over. He asked us our ag
es.And...uh...I reme mber I think I was about 14 
at that...atthat time , and ...uh...the 
kid next to me , he asked him hisa I aD age, and he told 
them 14. THet ma rked down his number.Uh...I 
had felt that was not a good sign, so when 
he walkedup to me , I told him I was 15. I tr
ied to lie about a year
.D He looked at me  
twice and just walked by me
. We ll, thatafternoon they came to pick up all the kids 
who[*...whosenumber they had written down. I never 
heard from them      @     again g

instrume nt, measuring device      7     like a 
    a square. And we 
had to walk under it. And 
Ireme mber you never knew whether to be tall is 
better or tobe short is 
better or to older or 
to be younger. You neveraw R O knew. There was a lot of deception, a lot of lies, 
andconfused us completely. And this I think, 
also, wasa; Q D instrume ntal in..in some  of 
us not being as resistant as weshould have been because we were completely lied 

to,deceived and mi shandled and by the time some of us woke up, ..            Q    it was 

almost too late. This measuring device I reme mb er  
               walking through it and I 
barely touched that bar-SSacross             
    and my number was 
not taken that da H Some  
of the shorter      =*         ones I reme
mber was taken. But you really never knew what      
S          was the right wayX They had you confused completelyg And      34 after that...I 

believe after Birkenau, we went...they evacuat
ed us or theytook us out to...uh...what they 
called...we went to Auschwitz for one day, a
nd theydid...and then Auschwitz, that was 
the big concentration;3 %~ camp ne ar Birken
au. And then they took us to which was 
called farm. And that farm wascalled _ Birken
au again. There were different name s. They 
separated a lot of us, andI wound up in that 
ofaq~ y Birkenau where I was very sick. Ha d 
pneumonia and stayed in...there was aHungari
an-Jewish doctor took 
care of the little 
hospital. He had a few bedsand...uh...he took care    
        of me with some  me dicines. I 
was there for quite a few      X     weeks I 
reme mb er and just barely got better or well by 
the            time they took us to Bu
chenwald. And that was quite aa 4 q O ma rch. Also 
I...another incident happened. I forgot to   
   tAo94(0talk about th
at one...in Birkenau 
when we got the needles.w      I don't know, 5, 
10 of us got the neelles and we were just a 
G (tlaying in whatthey call 
a hospital and the ma in docto
r who took care of us was a 
French-Jewishdoctor. He was extremely kind, un
derstanding and tried to help us. Matter 
;ao offact, he saved our lives th
ere. I reme mber before ..evacu
ation day, we had to be sick 
about 21 days in order to be declared notcontagi
ous and...uh...I think that day we      ;     
were about 17 days in the hospital and we re
me mber himr unning back and forth trying to 
doctor all kinds of peoplein charge and what we
 reme mber, he signed some thing or      35 
declared us well enough, we were not...we were
 not contagious anym
ore. Itwas touch and 
go until he  was ableX 1D to declare us not
 contagious and...and they were able to 
evacuate us with everyoneelse. 
In that of Birkenau ....(Pause)
 we were...we were mo st of 
us were working atW +¢r on;6 6 Z S thc tincv I don't re me mb er. I didn't work at the time. 
When I was there, I was sickand I didn't 
do too much.aL q O And...uh...if not for that 

Hungarian doctor, I woul dn't have survived th
ere either.Because I must have been well 
enough to make that long trip to Buchenwal
d. Wewere...we were(b about 6 days I believe 
and 6 nights. We  were walking for many, 
ma ny, ma ny days...for many hours and I think 
at night we stopped just for a little sleep a 
few hours. Andthen I think we were on trains. 
They put us on trains right before9D we got
 to Buchenwald. And it was wintertime and it 
was open wagons and you...wegot...uh...one of my eyes was very infected and...uh...I 

lived with that throughBuchenw
alda N qOmost of the time. Some days it was better, 
some days it was worse. But I don't thinkt
hat I had any treatment for that. Uh...In 
Buchenwald we were again in a children
'sbarrack, ina S n quarantine for 66. They 
brought 66 I believe in the back of the camp. In that barrack,there were a lot of 

Hungarians, Slovakians, German, Pol i sh Jewi
sh children and some of us, Lithuanians. 
And...uh...we didn't do any work because we; 3 
were in quarantine. And we...when you 
were in quarantine, they didn't ma ke you work. Theday...36
