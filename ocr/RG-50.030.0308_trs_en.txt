A. ___________________________, there was supremacy, so called Germa n supremacy.  
That was the idea.  My struggle, Hitler wrote th
ere was mostly his -- Alfred Rosenberg, I think 
he was Jewish.  He's  a philosophical and political
 advisor he wrote in this book, my accounts, my 
struggle, and then he designed what he was going 
to do to destroy the Jews
 to make socialism or 
whatever.  Usually __________________ what was taught 
in his time, if you want to deceive 
your enemy tell him the truth because any way 
he doesn't  believe you.  So, the people didn't 
believe  what Hitler thought.  I know ma ny Jews 
i n Germany, they were more German than 
Germans themselves, but they didn't believe what
 Hitler was going to do.  That was the problem.

dn't  think it wa s going to be a problem?  
A. Oh, yes, we thought.  Not only did we  have
 problems with Yugosla

three people as advisors.  Prince Paul and from

il 6, Hitler was already declaring wa r.  While 
we were talking he was 
thinking war declaration. 
Q. Was the country unanimous in opposing Hitler? 

A. Oh, yes.  Some  people, for example, when Pr
ince Paul --- his brother son to become  king.  
He was in contact with the Italians and there was in following of Hitler.  He told his son to avoid 

the war, to si gn the papers _______________ British and st uff like that. 

Q. So, you're saying that the people weren'
t unanimo us?   Some  people wanted to --- 
A. No, that was political, 
politicians not the people. 
Q. How did the population react? 

A. They did not like Germans at all.  I reme
mber in World Wa r I, part of Yugoslavia was 

occupied by Greeks.  I reme mber the 
cruelty of what the Germans did.

Q. But there probably were different a
ttitudes among the people from Croatia? 
A. The Cratons most of all, they come  to the Yugoslavians after World Wa r I.  They 
betrayed Austria, they betrayed Yugoslavia too.

in Austria.  But they were good friends.

Germans in Yugoslavia.  Cultural joins, they were all pr eparing for Hitler to ma rch in, so the air 

field, the military air field we had to 
_________________, but then we bought this air plane 
from Ger ma ny.  There was already _________ and we
 wanted to escape the occupation.  We  
ma rched to Greece and ____________ was the last facility
 to escape to go with the British army.  
But the British only took ma jor and up but not the

the British  that took the Yugosla

the communists were good friends so they had 
contact with Hitler.  The communists told us

way we tried to avoid any invitation but we coul
dn't avoid many communists 
that infiltrated this 
group, all the gestapo. 

Q. What were your responsibilities?

ust ma ny people.  The Germans we didn't 
have -- we had a meeting or conference, we didn't never.

the ma rxists, he did not like Hitler.  
It was '43 he committed suicide when he was called to
 Berlin.  So, he sent me  to Dachau, illegal.  
I was sentenced in the books for 
the gestapo I was executed, but he
 sent me  to a concentration 
camp so I had that pena lty.  But I was ma d because

 stopped the British, stop the trains.  
_________________, and stuff. 

Q. What st uff? 

A. War ma terial like ammu nition and grenades.  
That was the ma in business.  To stop them 
not to come  a time when you spring the railroad track
 they come  to take some  time to repair, to 
come  forward or you blow the train.  It's not so
 easy to go forward.  But they had so called

Q. What other specific actsdid you do for the resistance? 

A. _________________.  We first organized and t

organize companies to organize units.  To provi
de information, front information and stuff like 
that.  We  had ________________ that's been illegal newspaper for information about front and 

situation and such stuff.  It was meetings. 
 You organized and everybody knows what they'r e 

doing and what they get to do. 

Q. How did you get information? 

A. We had radios, we had stuff.  We  listened to
 the BBC.  It wa s not the voice of America, it 
was a different kind.  So, we got from Switzerland. 

Q. Was there a central meeting place? 

A. No, some  places we had to everybody with 
a radio with short waves and the radio was

A. There is not much to remember now. 
 I was only a year or so with them.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0308  
11 
 
A. If you walk through there you can be attacked 
by the communists.  You have to live like 
a rabbit.  To watch everything.  It was, you get us
ed to it and it's no big deal.  You're young and 
you know what you want.  You have to take precautions. 
Q. What kind of precautions? 

A. Precautions not to ma ke mi stake.  You can't  
talk to -- we had special code words to talk 
like usually the organization is to talk, 
-- you can't  talk to family or anybody.   
Q. Did you see your fa mily during this time?  

A. Notmuch. 

Q. Were you ever, other than that one time , we
re you ever caught or close to being caught? 
A. Sometimes yes, I don't know what happened 
but the Germans went and blocked all the 
city and then everybody tried to get the military 
barracks and someti me some see ms to me that 

they try us through the window, by passing the wi
ndows of the building. 
 Then some body with 
newspapers with holes, some body was watchi ng us but ma ybe I was lucky enough to be 

recognized or you get in trouble. For example, in 
Vienna, the gestapo didn't  read the paper, and 
the guy sent me  to the gestapo building.  I went over
 there and I read this 
direction and I went out 
and didn't say anything.   

Q. Were you afraid? 

A. What can you be afraid?   There is not much 
fear.  If you are afraid you cannot think.  You 
cannot be afraid.  If you are afra
id you stay home.  That is th
e rule.  You don't do it if you are 
afraid.  Fear cannot be mi xed with what you're
 doing.  Some how in split second you get, but you 
try to overcome  and to survey
 the situation to take proper 
handling.  Stuff you have to do. 
Q. Did you ever have cont
act with the communists? 
A. No, we'd kill each ot her, but I didn't have. 

Q. I've done some  reading and that's why I wa
nt to ask you this.  Is my sense that the 
communists and the resistance army had di
fferent me thods and had different goals? 
A. Yes.  We  had two _______________ and the one I think was the rank.  One was 

communists, the second one was ______________.  The 
communists were almost trying to tell 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0308  
12 
 
the tales of the Soviet Union and everything and th
ey tried to do much as 
possible in killing the 
German soldiers to force the people to join them
 to create terror.  For them there was something 
bigger so _______________ and so on and from the communists army this was terrible.  They 
were worse than the Germans in ma ny places.  
They were robbing from the people and take 
everything, money and food.  The people mostly we
re afraid fr om the communists more than 

from the Germans in ma ny places.   

Q. Now, you fi gured out that it 
would be better to go to Dach
au than to stay in prison? 
A. Stay in prison, the penalty to be ex
ecuted is better than to go to Dachau. 
Q. So, what happened.  Tell me  about your going to Dachau? 

A. Nothing.  You were transported over there.
  You come  before  camp, you c o me  to this 

quarantined barracks, blocks.  A
nd then after a couple weeks or 40 days you get registered.  No, 
before you come  there, you are staying in the sn
ow and the rain and they give you the number.  
The transports bring in the ___________ and they es
tablish the carts and 
then after this you go 
and are distributed to the blocks
.  In Dachau there were mos
tly after professionals and so, 
distribution.  I come  to an Austrian 
guy _____________, in block 16 and from that I was 

working with a Slovanian couple.  We went
 to the ______________ , to the train on the railroad 
station.  The couple was -- it was 
not -- with a black train.  They 
were stealing the civilian -- as 
you go to work outside the camp in Mauthassen, in
 Dachau they give yo
u civilian red paint and 
then later on I was working potato 
cell to peel the potatoes to sort
 them and to peel them.  The 
guards, it was mostly this ____________ from Pola
nd.  They called a lot of Pollocks, the 
Germans, they so called ________________ where you put 
the core and you could fry the potato 
to eat.  They didn't care too much.  They took 
for themselves the potatoes.  So, it was not 
some thing, not bad.  Then in some  walking across th
e street to plantation stuff, and ma ny went to 
Sauxenhausen which was also a branch of Dach
au.  Then, there was one time I was no more 
drove outside camp.  We  were cl
eaning inside and then I don't know what for reason but 600 or 
so were transferred to Mauthaussen.

and we come to Mauthaussen.  
I cannot reme mb er the route. 
Q. What was your impression of Dachau? 

A. Organized pure political, best
 organized.  I me t many Austrians over there in block 4.  
The Czechs were kitchen personnel.  It was not 
bad.  Then you have to wash before you come  -- 
same  as Mauthaussen -- when you come  to your bloc
k you have to wash first in your foot locker, 
and you have your meal or supper already.  To your
 place, but you have to wash.  You have to 
do, so it wasn't  much to eat but discipline and 
not much terror from th
e SS inside the camp. 
Q. The guards were okay? 

A. Outside the guards were we had kapos to be
 the guards.  The guards were washing us, so 
some how we did it and not allowed to talk to 
us.  The guard was differe
nt SS, not in camp, the 
block -- we had more difficulty with our kapos, 
with the person from he prison area in the camp. 
Q. Whymoredifficulty? 

A. Well, they were beating you.  They were 
stealing your food.  They
 were kicking you out 
to the work place.  They didn't let you stay.  
You had to work outside camp, too.  They keep you 
busy.

Q. These were German criminal prisoners? 
A. Yes, as a political pr isoner you could not 
get any position if you wanted.  It was mostly 
criminal. 

Q. Were there Jewish prisoners there? 

A. In Dachau there was only one small guy that was cleaning the shoes for the SS.  I don't 

know what happened to him later.  First time Je
ws in Mauthaussen, Jews come  2,000 some .  It 
was the last  transpor t for the Jews and then in '45 they come  from Auschwitz.  As a Je w in 

Dachau and communist you could not survive.  As
 a Jew or communist in Dachau they send you 
to Auschwitz or kill you there. 

Q. While you were there, this happened? 

A. Oh, yes.   It was ma ybe some  in the _________________ in the countr

they send them to Auschwitz
 or destroyed over there. 
Q. When you were working or had your appells 
in your barracks were you mi xed with other 
prisoners or were you with 
only political prisoners?

them were political or maybe the blue. 

Q. I'mconfused? 

A. Blue triangle for the bible, so called gyps
ies or the Spanish.  
Spanish had good position, 
they were kitchen personnel.

and the political pris
oners were the same ?

Q. We were talking about the 
different kinds of prisoners at
 Dachau and I'm wondering were 
you separated according to your type  or did you work
 with people with di
fferent classifications. 
A. With people who were French, I mean nobody your number and your name put you in the 
working group and you went to work.   

Q. Did the political pr isoners work with the POWs? 

A. No.  The POW was a different kind.  It wasn
't  Geneva Convention, they were entitled to 
work but different procedure. 

Q. Were some  prisoners treate
d better than other prisoners? 
A. I don't think so.  I did not see.  Maybe the 
homosexuals were treated 
better but the normal 
people, everybody the same . 

Q. Did you come  in contact with a 
lot of the homos exual prisoners? 
A. No.  It was not like it in the camp so they 
were isolated.  They 
had all the good positions 
too.  They were mostly musicians and stuff like this. 

Q. Do you think the political prisoners were tr
eated better than some  
of the other people? 
A. No, this was wars.  It was not different, we 
were all political  except the camp personnel.  
It was from the instructions of the political depa
rtme nt or gestapo.  Many of them they get to go 
to the city.  That was also diffe
rent.  In Germany I think the se
ntence required more than five 
years imprisonme nt they were executed, the death 
penalty it wa s.  It was mostly, my kapo was a 
guy that stole a parcel in the post office.  He wa
s upstairs so that this should happening it me ans 
the end of the war.  They were after the war to serve. 

Q. Now, I reme mber reading that when you 
went to Dachau you were a clerk, in the 
admi nistration? 

A. No.  I was not a clerk.  A guy _____________, he 
was original in camp, a clerk and he 
saved my life.  If I say I was an officer I co
uld be executed.  He said
 are you stupid.  You say 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0308  
17 
 
you are an employee.  He changed my card.  He saved my life .  He was later on in the 
______________, of Cz echoslovakian decent.  He saved 
my life.  I was never in the office. 

Q. What was an average day like? 

A. You'd have t o get up at 5:00 to wash, to ge
t the coffee, not really coffee.  It was from 

grain.  If you are fast you get 
warm, if you're slow you get cold.  That wa s morning.  You had to 
go to roll call to get counted.  Then, group 
formation.  If you are attached to a working 
commander you have to join your kapo and then wa
lk out.  If you are not attached, they put you 
there and write your number and 
you work and you work until 6:00, 7:00, it depends, and then 
come  back.  We 'd ma rch, __________________.  That was -- we had in Dachau Sunday was off 

and everybody was sitting some where preparing 
their stuff.  You get wood down and in two 
weeks they were gone.  ______________________, 
that was the daily life. 
Q. When you came back fr om the fields, wher
ever you were working at 6:00 then what 
happened?  

A. You had to wash yourself to get the sh
eets washed.  They watched you shower, if you 
washed your face and head proper and you went inside
 to ge t your supper.  It was in Mauthausen 
too.  You had your food locker and it was alre
ady there you we re sitting some where to eat. 

Q. What did you eat? 

A. You got this ________________ military bread, dry so
 it can stay ten years.  Two pieces 
and they give you some  ma rgarine or some  stuff. 
 That was all, and some  coffee.  That was -- 
lunch you get some  soup, some  cabbage or beets or
 I don't know.  It was mostly vegetable soup.  

You had to eat fast.  You didn't have one hour or 
half hour.  You had to eat and go to work.  It 
was terrible.  We  stand under the tree, the slope,
 eating your soup.  You cannot choose.  I wasn't  
a big eater, so I'd save my lard so some  pe
ople would have a piece of bread -- when they 
distributed the soup they left some  of this
 in ________________ and you had 
to run to get this 
_______________ extra.  Mostly the stuff they distri
buted they hit you with this spoon, it was 
not the kind of huma n.  You see di
fferent kinds of people.  What you learn in this civilization is 
the whole situation disappears, you are as you are bor
n, animal.  You see the animal behavior.  It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0308  
18 
 
was terrible.  For example, if you are the last
 and some body fell down, you 
pick up the people in 
the front took care of him.  They kill them on the way because they'r e hit and they didn't want to 
carry them because sometime you are weak too.  They kill him before they brought them in the 

camp, so it was terrible.  You see it was not 
too ma ny relations because everybody wanted to 
save hims elf.  Like _____________ says
 ________________________. It was not human.  You 
tried to avoid everything and some  people you 
can talk or communicated or you're thinking 
about past  families and stuff.  It was sad. 

Q. Did you ma ke any friend there?  Did you have
 ma ybe a partner that you could help each 

other? 

A. No, it was impossible because tomo rrow you 
are taken to another commander or anot her 

barrack or the block.  Not the kind you can deal with.  I tried to be human with the people but not 

special relation. 

Q. Did you have your own bed in the barracks? 

A. We had three floors of bed.  First, down th
ere four, two heads are here and two heads are 
there.  Second floor, the same .  Third floor was  
three only.  Two on one side and one.  That was 
the beds.  In Dachau, it was two peoples each bu
t it depends on if there co mes a new transpor t, 
the put in like sardines.  This
 is you cannot change the positions
.  But anyway you are tired and 
sleep.  Some times they were stealing their shoes.
   You cannot imagine.  I read a book before I 
come to Dachau it was in the wester n something 
new, it was for the World War I.  I forgot who 

wrote the book, in World Wa r I.  And the guy that 
escaped from Dachau went to Switzerland and 
he wrote about the concentration camp and it was 
some thing new, and there was a description of 
a Dachau book about concentrati
on camp in Germany, and I could 
not imagine at all before I 
come  in, you understand. 

Q. Were there a lot of new transports comi ng in? 

A. In Dachau they not come much, eve r y thre
e or four months.  But Dachau keeps certain 
amounts of prisoners.  I think they had 42,300some  and all the group, one group they said 

42,000 sent to Mauthausen a  year later, so they
 have -- I don't know how much they had to have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0308  
19 
 
and never exceed.  I think it was before the SS d
ecided to put the regime  to work in the war 
industry and they took the ability 
in Austria, the industry facility, 
needed prisoners.  The SS used 
them before they destroyed them.  Da chau was 
only to work for the needs of the camp, industry 
stuff.  We  had to plant our own vegetables 
and take care of all th
e cleaning and stuff.  
Mauthaussen was the center.  80,000 prisoners ca
me  to Mauthaussen under different branches.  
Going to Mauthaussen wa s a different story. Mauthaussen was discipline too, so you get your 
food but you didn't stay long in Mauthaussen.  I came  in Nove mber I think.  I was already in 

Christma s transport to _____________.  That was the 
camp, the camp and four barracks.  It was 
a small one.  The guy, the ________________, the SS ma
n was announced all officers and all 
dignity and he did it with orde
r.  The kapos couldn't bother you 
in camp.  Outside okay, but gave 
us order.  It came, I was surprise
d it was Christmas.  He ordered th
e kitchen to give tea with rum.  
I fainted, almost, you are weak.  It was dumb.  Th
en he distributed the ci
garettes himself.  Not 
____________, not nobody.  So, it was some how huma n.  We  had good music, good theater.  

One guy came and said in Germany the 
potatoes are good, but in Dachau they 
_________________.  Music was okay.  He come  with his da
ughter to listen to the bands.  It was 
some how, the SS kitchen was the same  in ca mp.  So, I me t fr iends, I went to high school and 

such.  _________ Joseph.  I didn't know it was German, but a German office and he wa s afraid 

when he saw me .  He s a id don't talk, and later 
on he saw me and said 
I cannot talk but I can 
inform your parents that you are here.  So, when he
 went to eat the lunch 
he went to my barrack, 
went to my bed, asked me where I sleep a
nd left his food.  I didn't see him anymore. 
Q. How long were you in Mauthaussen, the ma in camp?  

A. Mauthaussen, not long, one month two months
, not long.  They didn't keep you.  You get 
the number and there were three or four central
 camps.  Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthaussen and 
Auschwitz and Birkenau, where you get the number.  So, when you get to Mauthaussen and get 

the number, they send you then -- in 
Mauthaussen it was 16, it was _______________ one, two 
and three, and then _________________ industry, 
steel industry.  Then it was

was very difficult.  You had to load the sand 
for the cement.  In Mauthaussen, we had logger 
police.  Special criminals brought and then we 
had down there in the working place we had so

were eating -- some  fugi tive from the front come  into and got wrong way and come  into the 

camp, the SS was scared and put into us they have horses and then at night the prisoners killed 

the horse and they tried to eat him up.  You ca
nnot imagine how terrible it was to fight for the 
bread.  Whe n the Americans came it was not so fast
 to bring the food.  There was killing in camp 
for the kapos that -- the poor and they were cook
ed in the kitchen.  They cooked them alive and

so was the killings.  I could not
 work.  I couldn't do anything. 
 There was prisoners looking for 
the SS people.  They were already long 
gone.  There was _____________ in the population.  I 
cannot imagine the hasidic didn't know what wa
s going on upstairs.  The Americans brought to 
demonstrate but the American did not give us food for one day because one general was killed. 
Q. The Americans punished you? 

A. Punished us all time they didn't give us to 
eat because you cannot let this stuff to justice.  
So, mostly Russians they were, but at that time
 mostly they were robbing the population there 
some  guy took the sauerkraut and he was dead.   Th
ey did this stuff.  It was in this ________ cell 

or tent there was hospital and the 
American nurse let me  box of milk chocolates.  I could not eat.  

I tried but it was so -- I give it to 
_____________ next to me  was a Polish guy ___________.  He 
at it all.  He ate all of it 
and two days later he was dead.  A young fellow.  He died.   
Q. Can you think of anything that you did in th
ese camps out of desperation that you can't 
even imagine you've done? 

A. No, you cannot think.  You are like u
nder hypnosis.  You have no proper thinking 
because __________ you just count today how long you'll stay alive.  There was no political or 

philosophical thought.  You are not normal.  It 
is impossible to do anything because I cannot 
walk ten feet or twenty feet and not fall down. 
 I had to sleep on the third floor because if you 
sleep down there on first floor on the second 
there was a Polish or Czech guy so called 
_____________ he'd kill you to get your food.  There was killing from _______________.  They 

were killing the people at night
 they were watching the room.  So, you are thinking how to 
escape to sleep, to lie down.  I was lucky I did not 
have to go to toilet so often so I was some time  
all day long.  I did not move from my place. 

Q. Anything that just  had to do because  his wasn't  norma l? 

A. Nothing, you tried to get your little coffee to 
get the peel of potatoes to eat and to get 
through small piece of bread. 
 That was the daily --. 
Q. How about me dical experime nts? 

A. What?

Q. Did you know anything either in Dachau 
or in Mauthassan camps about me dical 
experime nts? 
A. In Mauthaussen behind the 
crematorium there was experiments.  I don't know what they 

did, but there were Yugoslav doctor.  Doctor
 ____________ was working but I didn't talk.  He 
said stay away.  Many pe ople who get good co
ndition they were commanded by the kapo to 
work in the crematorium and after two months al
l the people working there were dead so they 
can't  tell what is going on.  It wa
s not far, the next city to me  so
 some ti me  he talked to me .  He 
did not tell what they were doing. 

Q. Did you notice anything in Dachau? 

A. In Dachau I didn't notice anything.  There were
 no such facilities.  In Mauthaussen it was 

already and  I think some body told me  it star
ted in Auschwitz too, but not in Dachau. 
Q. But you didn't  know anybody who had been treated? 

A. No.  I didn't know. 

Q. Were there many suicides? 

A. Not intentionally.  Some body run and get ki
lled by the SS or so.  You are weak, there 
was no way to kill yourself.  You come  so far 
and you wait for what happen to you.  You are not 
able to ma ke any decision.  The beginning okay, th
e first time you come  over there you think it is 
best dead and so what is process in time go 
forwa r d you lose everything, proper feeling proper 
thinking.  You already ha ve writte
n yourself off.  At the same time I didn't  believe I am still 
alive.   

Q. Any efforts for people to try to escape? 

A. Oh, yes there were a couple escapes r
eally and I think a couple come  through from 
Dachau.  So, it was as I said I think in '45 in 
Mauthaussen was a snow storm and there was like a 
small ___________________ and it was the snow and some  
tried to escape but they were all 
killed.  All of them dead.  Only one that I reme mber that people tried to escape.  From 

_____________ you couldn't. Every where was the SS leaving the barracks.  You could not go
