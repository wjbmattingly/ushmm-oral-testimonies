, Drohobycz was a pretty little town of about40,000people 
equally di vided between Polishnationality people, Ukrainian,and Jews.  So there was 
about 14,000 Jews.  Each of these groups had their own cultural venues. They had 

sports clubs. T here were soccerteam s, Jewi sh soccer team s.They were playing 

against Polish and Ukrainian soccer team s. Oneof m y uncles was a star inone of 

t h e se so cce r te am s.
 
T here were theaters.There were all kindsof activities for the people.  Poland 
--
 
when 
Hit le r go t  t o  
power in 1933, there were somewhere 
--
 
som e inf luence on his Nazi 
philosophy in Poland. Some organizations inPoland em bracedthat 
--
 
his theories.  
And there were persecution of  Jews.  T herewere things called numerous classes that 

Jews could not attendcertain universities or there was a quota to whenthey could 

attend. Ania'sf ather studied medicine in Switzerland.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because of the num erous classes?
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Becauseof  thenum erous classes.  Jews could not serve as 
of f ic e rs  in  
thePolishArm y.  Those that did were theones that were professionals and 

they were, you know, conscripted.
 
But we 
--
 
with the neighbors and with other people, we really got well, we had a good 
--
 
we were happy people.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littlebit about your parents.

Andm y m other was the oldest of

and so forth.

th
, the
 
Russians came andoccupied Drohobycz.  
Once you were underRussian occupationduring thosef irstfew period of the war, 

what was lif e like under the Russians?W hatchanged?
 
>> Marcel Drim er: W ell individually, our f am ily was treated just likeever ybody 
e lse 's 
fam ily.  But the Russians tried to im pose theSoviet econom ical and political system  

on us. T hey have 
--
 
they have taken away private businesses. They have sent a lot 
of  pe o p l e 
--
 
people that they considered enem ies of the state, they sent to Sibe
ri a .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Likethe intelligencia? 
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Like the intelligencia.  Asa matterof fact,Ania'sparents were 
deportedtoSiberia where she was born during the war.  
 
I would also like tom ention something.  Today, 10

the cutting

m assacre and cutting.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Massm urder? 
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Yeah. W henthe Russians came to Poland in Septem ber, they 
took POW several thousand soldiers, Polishsoldiers and officers. T hey releasedthe 

pr

--
 
>> Bill Benson: T ook the officer class, right?
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  And took the officers andsenior NCOs. And they killed them all.  
22,000.  22,000 of the Polish off icers and senior NCOs were m urdered on thatday in

1940.  So
 
this is the 74th anniversary today.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Marcel, since you were under the comm unist system  at that point, 
som e of  yourfam ily mem bers joined the Com munistParty? 
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Yes.  Som e of m y auntswere m embers of the comm unist party 
fr
om before the war.  They were idealistic, and it sounded quite nice to them.
 
You know?  Everybody contributesaccordingto hisabilities andeverybody else 
--
 
and 
ever ybody gets according to their needs. Sounds very good. W e know that itdoesn't 
work all
 
the tim e.  But they were young, and they joined.T hey would 
--
 
m y fa the r's 
aunts would go dem onstrating on May
 
1st,f or exam ple, in the m iddle of the road.  
Andfather would walk on the side of the road.  And, when thepolice cam e on horses, 

m y f ather would run into the crowd m arching crowd and took his sisters out.
 
W eknew in Drohobycz we know what was goi ng on in westernPoland inW arsaw.  
W arsaw ghetto was established in1940. Germ ans already startedtheir extermination 

of  the Polish Jews.  Som e of  the Jews m anaged to escape and come tothe Russian 

territories.  So, when the Germ ans attackedPoland, when theGerm ans attacked 

Russia in the Barbarossa Operation.  It was the biggest operation in the history of  

warf are.  It took 
--
 
theGerm ans attacked Rus
s ia  in  
--
 
on the June
 
22
nd
.   A nd  on  
June
 
30th, they were already in Drohobycz.
 
B u t  m y 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T his was 1941? 
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  This was 1941, right.  Most of m y uncles were taken to the Russian 
Arm y, conscripted to the Russian Arm y.  Andsom e
 
of m y aunts were married to these 
uncles or

they joined theSoviet Arm y in their retreat, andthey went to the

Russia.  Because they knew what was going on inthe 
--
 
on the western part of  
Poland.  Germans were on the river, so theyonly had 200
 
k i l om et e rs  t o  c om e to  
Drohobycz.  T he Russians were not prepared tof ight theGermans.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So som e of your uncles andfam ilies going to Russia, but you stayed 
in Drohobycz? 
 
>> Marcel Drim er: W e stayed in Drohobycz because m yf ather at that time was 
--
 
I 
was only f ive years old, and m y sister was three years old.  No,Im ixed up thedates.  
But I was ver y young, and m y sister was even younger.
 
And two of theseuncles were killed on thef ront. Soviet soldiers. But all the others, 
m y aunts and
 
uncles that went to Russia, they sur vi ved.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So here you, though, yourfam ily is still in Drohobycz.  And now you're 
under the Nazi control.  W hathappenedonce they were there?

--
 
the Germans started im posing their rules of  occupation.  
T he Jews were not allowed to

a rm s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Evenbicycles? 
 

>> Marcel Drim er:  Even bicycles.  Everything they wanted totake,they would take.
 
T hey would 
--
 
the Jews were supposed to wear an arm  band, childrenf rom 8 up, arm  
band with theStar of David.  Andthey im posed rationing of food. T he Jewish kids 

couldnot goto school.  They closedall the Jewish schools. T he Aryans were allowed 

to go to school 1

slaves needto know how to readand write.  T he Jews were destined tobemurdered, 

so there was noneed to teach the children reading and writing.  T hese were the rules

of  the ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
And the Germ ans started doing what we call a
k t i o ns
. T ell us what 
th a t is.
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  There were two kinds of aktions. T here were 
loot
ing, and there 
were m urder aktions.The Germ ans would com e with their localhelpers, and they 
would take whatever they wantedto take f rom our houses and apartm ents. And they 

would 
--
 
and oneof  these 
--
 
m y m other was holding m y sister in herarm s. And the 
Germ ans were takingsom efurniture out. And m y sister was cryin g.  And the Germ an 

of f i c e r  s a ys ,  "W hat  a be a
utiful Aryan lookingchild."
 
Shehad blue eyes and she was blonde.  "Too bad that she's Jewish.  But don't cry, 
little girl.  T oday we just comefor your things.W edidn't com efor you."
 
B u t 
--
 
and then there were aktions when they were reall y just killing people on the spot 
and whenthey were taking people tothe exterm ination cam p.  
 
I would like totalk about the aktion in 1942. T his isbefore the ghetto was established. 
In our small apartm ent, there were nine people. T here weref ourof us. T here wa
s 

this grandf atherthat you can see here, a grandm other whosehusband was killed by 

the Germans. Andm aybe I'll go back and talk aboutm y f irstfew days of  the 

Germ ans.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Please do.
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Okay.  I'll go back afew days.  T hef irstfew days  of  the Germans 
occupation, they 
--
 
when the Russians retreated,they killed groupsof  nationalist 
Ukrainians. T hey considered them  enem ies. And they lef t thedeadpeople in the 

m iddle of town.  And they spread a rumor
 
--
 
Idon't know who spread the rumor 
--
 
th a t

the Jews killed these Ukrainians. SotheGerm ans gave the Ukrainians af reehand. 
T hey could kill and rob the Jews, you know, without any responsibilities.  So they 
--
 
in  
Drohobycz, they cam e 
--
 
there were some farm ers f rom  nearby v
illa ges.  They came 
to m y grandfather's house, m y m other's father. And they beat him  up.  T hey didn't 

have accesstohospitals or to doctors.  So m y grandf ather died within 10 days.  But, 

when they took som e things outf rom m y grandparent's apartm ent, they
 
took album s 
of  photos. T hey took these album s,and they shook them out in them ud and inthe 

yard and took thealbum s away.  A neighbor,name Mr. Kutskoff, a neighbor picked up 

the pictures
 
--
 
there were about50of  them
 
--
 
and kept them  in hishouse.  A
fte r the  
war m y f ather went there and to look what was lef tf rom m y grandparents' house.  And 

there was nothing lef t.  Butthe neighbor came out andhanded m yfather these 50 

pictures. Som eof the pictures you have seen here, like thepicture ofme andm y
 
m other was partof  that batch. All these pictures arenow in the Holocaust Museum .  

And I donatedthese pictures to the Holocaust 
M
useum .  
 
My f atherat that time was invol ved
 
--
 
he was  sentthere tothe university f or some 
courses. I don't know exactly
 
what.  Maybe build the nation. T his iswhat the 
Russians were like.
 
>> Bill Benson:  what the Russians 
--
 

>> Marcel Drim er:  Right. So when the Russians attacked,m y father wanted to com e 
home andbe with hisfam ily.  Butthe peopleat the university sa
id ,  we ll,  t h is  is  wa r 

that's going to bef ought som ewhere else. W e will keep going to school.   You know, 

you don'thave to worr y about it.  Of  course,seven days later, theGerm ans were 

invol ved.

And

but the situation was quite bad in thisapartment. T here was overcro wding.  
T here was ninepeople in a place whereaboutf ourpeople should have li ved.  
 
Andm y nanny cam e to the apartment.  She would come oncea week and bring milk 
andfood andplay with  m e.  Sheoff eredm y m other that she wouldtakem eto her 
apartm ent because Ididn't look good, obviously.  And she wouldf eed me up and give 

m ea bath, and then she would bring m e back.  So she took me to her apartm ent.  Or 

house.  Andaf ter two, threedays, m y sister Irena started bothering my m other saying, 

" I want to get Marcel back.  I wanttoplay wit h Marcel."
 
Som other said, "Okay, we'll go and get him  back." She took off her arm band, whic
h 
wa s

the Germans would know that it was punishable by death.  Anything was 
punishableby death. Any excuse to kill Jews was okay.  
 
So she took her arm band and took her andm y sister with her andcam e tothe 
nanny's house. W henshe cam e there, I was
 
sitting in the corner crying and Jancia 
was in labor.  She was pregnant and giving bi rth, and there was nobody else there.  

Andm y m other,of  course helpedher, did what she could do to help her. And the 

baby was stillborn.  But that tim e it got tobedark.  And Jancia asked us to stay with 

her in her apartment,which we did.  Andnext morning, herhusband cam ef rom  work.  

He was work ing night shift. And he said thatthere isanaktion in Drohobycz going on 

thatthe Germ ans are killing people thatthey are taking them away and, if they would

hiding Jews, helping Jews was also punishable by death.  And he said you have to go 
tom y m other and ask

there is a wheat f ield in f ront of  the house.  T here's a little 
road,a wheatf ield. And behindthat thereare some woods. And hegave my mother

As we crossed the road and cam e into the wheatf ie

this was August.  So wheat 
was already ripe.  My m other hada raincoatthat was the color of  the wheat.  And, as 

we looked

we did.  
 
And soon af ter that,the

we could hear dogs barking, Germ ans scream ing " Rous! 
Rous!"   
 
People begging in shouts and scream s of pain.  And it got quietforanother few 
m inutes,15,20m inutes.  And it started all over again. This was like a light motif  in 

the sym phony, over and over.

7:00 in theevening.  But quiet.W

andtook usacross the road. As we cam e to the road, looked around, there was no 

cars, obviously, at thattime. It was a sm all road. But there was a Germ an soldier 

with a dog staring atus.  He looked atus,and we lookedathim .  And it lasted maybe 

15

20 seconds. But itseemed likef orever. W ethought this is going to bethe end of

T h is  
--
 
the only reasonthatI could see 
--
 
well,  several reasons m ight be 
th a t 
contributedto that.  Norm ally, when the Germans went huntingfor Jews, they would 
go in pairs. Because they knew that somebody could have a humane, you know, idea 

to letthe Jew live.  But, if they were together,theother one would tell on eachoth
e r.   
So this isone reason.  
 
T he other reason is maybe the Germ ans were so well
-
organized that they gave 
them selves quotas.  Maybe hehad his quotas of  kills.  Anyway, he just walked 

around.  
 
And we cam eto Jancia's house. And it wasquite dark,and we 
stayed there for 
another night.  
 
Next m orning m yf ather cam e topick usup. Father was working at that lumber factory 
where Jews who did not have fam ilies lived and worked. They haddorm itories where 

they worked.
 
Sof ather survi ved that pogrom .  He came

as we cam e tothe house, the door was broken in. Thefeathers weref lying all over

th e
 
road. You stay here.  Hide in thebushes. You stay here. You'rea man. And I'll 
take m om  and Irena and then com e back for you."   
 
So he tookm other and Irena.  And I got very panicky.  I was nom an.  I was eight 
years old.  And scared and hungry.  And I heard stories of people abandoning children 

and, you know, and trying to save their lives.  Anyway, I was terribly scared. SoI ran 

af terfather.  And the guards noticedf ather.He says, " You can't be here. It's illegal."  

Anyway, f ather gave him  a ja
cket off  his neck and bought another tim e to live.  
 
W e were hiding inthat shackfor drying wood.  Father would bring

at night he would 
bring som efood andtake waste down, away.  Andthis was like it lasted two or three 

we e ks.

lum beryard.  And in the lumberyard where he works, he has constructeda hiding 

placeamong the drying racks f orthe wood. Sof or several weeks his fam ily, his wife 

andhis two children, are hidden inside the lum berfactory.  T hat's pretty am azing.
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Yes.  But the way he

yo u know, atnight he would deliver f ood to

som ething and saw m y father at night with the cans,food. And she conf ided to 

another young lady saying I think Drim er

in Polish Drim er, she said, "I think Drim er 
is hiding someone here.  AndI have tom ake sure that is thetruth. And, when I'm

Som y f ather was absolutely f labbergasted. Terribly upset. W hat todo.  There's 
nowhere tohide, nowhere to go.  But he hada very goodf riend who was a doctor, 

physician, who studied in Viennaand was ver y f luent in German. They cam eup with

on leave f rom thef ront and that he he had sexual encounter with this Theresca and 

she infected him  with a venereal disease.
 
(Laughter.)
 
T hink about the doctor's Hippocraticoath.  Doctor.  Hehad todo it. Anyway, next day, 
the two SS men came and took Theresca away and tookher to the little clinic where 

thedoctor was in charge.  I don't know thedetails, but I know that she was put away 

until the endof  the war.  She could not

Sawinski said, " I

and it was easy to recognize a Jewish boy

" then we all die. 
W e will all die, and I can't do it. So I'll takeIrena andLaura."  My f ather agreed.  He

she looked very sem itic, the girl.  Curly hair.  She looked 
J e wi s

girl took him  to her Mom m y.  Andthen he told

this wom an's name was T ushia

" Look, you are endangering ever ybody by letting this girl run around."
 
And they started seeing each other. She thought herhusband was oneof  those taken 
by the Russian constricted. And she som ehow f ound outhe was taken prisoner of 

war.  M y uncle was wi dower, obviously.  So they startedbeing together.  Andthen he 

brought her to the Sawinskis.  Her and the little girl.

weren't you?

tim e that we could get out and breathe som efresh air.  Becauseeverybody was 
hiding.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So everybody is in hiding for thebom b, and you com eout to getf resh 
air?

go t o u t, I

during
 
the nine m onths we were

as Im entioned bef ore, we were either 
in the lying down position or sitting position. And we arenot supposed to talk loud.  I 

--
 
m y leg m uscles were atrophied.  I couldn'treally keep m y body straight.  And, of 
course, I couldn'ttalk loud.  I couldonly whis per.  And we didn't have anything to 

wear. W e did not have anything toeat. W e did not have a place to go because our 

apartm ent was taken over by Uk rainians or Poles. W e just don't know.  
 
Anyway, but all the Jews who survi ved that together centerof  town, in a certainplace, 
there was all togetherabout 450of  us.  Drohobycz had 12,000 Jews.  450 survived.  

Another 400 camef rom  Russiaandf rom  the POW cam ps. And among those that 

cam ef rom  cam ps was Tushia'shusband who

here was a tragedy f rom  a f am ily

But m y f ather

when the Germ ans 
cam e, they calledm y father to theKGBand said, " You survived.  90% of  the Jews 

were killed.  You must have been a collaborator."  Andm yf ather said, "I survived 

because I survi ved.  I did not denounce anybody."   He gat
hered som e people, m aybe 
thedoctor that helped him  or somebody. T hey went to testif y thatmy f ather was nota 

collaborator.  Being alive, they considered that you could have been a collaborator 

with the Germ ans.

the Holocaust was just

First of all,m y parents hadto tell their siblings who was killed and when and where 
andhow.  And I listened to all these stories. T here no television.  Iknow all these 

detailsf rom  whatm y parents were telling their siblings. W e left Drohobycz in 

December
 
1945 because this Drohobycz becam e part of the SovietUnion andpartof
 
Germ any.  Eastern part of Germany is the Yalta agreem ent becam epart of Poland.

>> Marcel Drim er:  I was 10 years old. And Iwas ill iterate,and I had to go to school.  
So they decided not to gi ve

put me in thef irst grade. They putm e in the second 
grade.  Because Ididn't reador write, but that's okay.  I was not quite normal.  I did 
not run around with the kids.  Ididnottalk. Iwas sitting quiet.  And, you know, the 

teacher com plainedto m y m other that your son is not norm al.  He's not playing
 
wi t h  
other children. And so forth.  Butm other said look, give him  another few months and 

he'll beperf ectly normal.  I tried very hard tobe normal.

you do, till us aboutthe advice yourf ather gave you about anoccupation.
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Right.  Right. I graduatedhigh school in 1953.  Both my sister and 
I were ver y good students.  I caught up.  I was three yearsbehind because of the 

Holocaust.  But I caught up two years. And Iwas still 19 when I graduated.  Very, very 

good, with ver y good results. And the tim e com es toapply to the universit y.  I was 

interested innice things of  lif e.  I liked good music.  I liked reading a lot. And 

philosophy.  And I suggested to m yf ather that maybe I will go to thehumanities.  And

the entire af ternoon and bey
ond to dig just even a little deeper.  Unfortunately, we 
can't do that.  I'd like to thank all of youf orbeing here. W e really appreciate it.  I'm  

going to turnback to Marcel in justam om entto close ourprogram . Butfirst I'd like to 

rem ind you that we wil l  have First Person program s eachW ednesday andT hursday 

until them iddle of August.  You can get inf orm ation on ourW eb site.  
 
It's our tradition that our f irst person gets the last word.  So, bef ore I turn to Marcelf or 
the last word, I want to m ention two things.  One, because we didn't have a chancefor 

question andanswers, Marcel when he'sf inished will step off the stage over here.  

So, if  you want to come and m eet him , shake his hand, aska question,please do so. 

Don't be inhibited atall.

>> Bill Benson:  It isnew.  It is brand
-
n e w.
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  I'm  talking to you andothers who want to listen to m e because 
thereare people andorganizations who claim  that Holocaust is a hoax that it never 

happened,that the Jews m ade itup to getmoneyf rom the Germ ans.  I am a witness 

that it didhappen. By listening tothe storiesof m y childhood, you become witnesses 

also.  Our goodf riend,the late Charlene Schiff  said that we all have to fight thefour 

evil Is:  Intolerance, injustice, ignoranceand indiff erence. T hese are the roots of  

m en's moral corruption that allowed Hitler and his master race helpers to com e to 

power and tortureandm urder m illionsof  people he considered underm entioned,not 

worth li ving.  Not only Jews but people with disabilities, gypsies, hom osexuals,and 

m any other groups.  Changing these behaviors is the path topreventing Holocaust 

and genocides.  Andthis is what the Holocaust Museum  isall about. 
 
And I would like to read a quotef rom  
Pastor
 
Martin Niem ollerabout not getting 
invol ved.  " First they cam e f or the socialists,andI did not speak out becauseI was not 

a socialist. Then they cam efor thetrade unionist,and I did not speak out because I 

was not a tradeunionist.  Then they camefor the Jews, andI did not speak out 

because I was not a Jew.  T hen they cam ef or m e, and there was noone lef t to speak 

f o r me . "
