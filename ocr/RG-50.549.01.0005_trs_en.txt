Ta pe  1 , Si de  A 
 
Questi on:   I 'm j ust  going t o have you 
say your name and wh
en you we re bor n. 
Ans wer:  Thomas Bue r gent hal , bor n inCzec hos lova kia -- Luboc hni a, Cze choslovaki a. 
Today it 's Sl ova kia .  
Q: I 'm going t o spe ak wit h
 you today mo stly about th
e peri od after t he war and 
liberation, but I do have one 
question about the time that
 you spent in concentration 
camp, which is this: at the 
period when you were still wi
th your mother and father , 
did they e v er sit you down and, i n  essen
ce, s o rt of give y
ou advic e on how to 
survive, try to teac
h you a sur vival  strate gy, or  di
d they themselv
es know what  
actually might workin
 that sit uati on?  
A: Well , I -- not reall y in any sort of form
al sense, at least, I don't rememb er it. Of 
cour se, as a child, you pr oba bly l earn mu ch
 mo re fr om observi
ng than you do fr om 
being tol d things . But I do 
re me mb er my  fath er sa yin g 
-- whe n  we wer e  -- wh en h e  
and I were l eft al one -- that the one t hing 
that was critical was not
 to eat  food t hat 
wa s dirt y or cont a mina t e d. That 's t he onl y so
rt of t hing I rememb
er because a lot o f 
people woul d try to eat t hings out of garb
age c a ns , and t hen of cours e  get s i ck. He  
always war n ed me about  that . 
Ot her wise, I reall y can't t h
ink of them so
rt of telling 
me ﬁYou shoul d do t his or that ,ﬂ
 but one of cours e sa w a lot 
of t hings that one had t o  
do. I obs erved my fat her , who's  gr eat  streng
t h wa s that , t hat you c ould see  that he  
always thought thi ngs out be fore he did it,
 and he would not be 
sort  of c o we d i nto

running but he would ma ke his decis i on a nd 
then stick by it and 
that was something 
I noti ced, that a lot of pe ople 
got  kill ed or  were c aught beca us e the y act ed too fast .  
They di dn't sort of take 
account of the environment and 
then act. That 's somethi ng  
he did;  he was a  ma ster a t  that .  
Q: The r e wa s a  poi nt wh ere  
you had be en s epar ate d fr om 
your mother  and you were  
able t o see your mother brie
fly, in a concentra
tion ca mp. Did s he s a
y anything at that  
poi nt, gi ve you any advic e?  
A:  No, but, you know, I thi n k 
bot h my fa ther and mot her sort 
of knew that I -- I had sort 
of grown up in the camp. An d 
they probably knew that ther
e  wa sn't a ny a dvic e that 
they c oul d give me that I sort of, tha t  
I hadn't alr eady bee n doing. Reall y  the onl y  
advi ce or t h e onl y goal of our li fe, t he lo
ng-t er m goal , was  to stay a live, and the  
short-term goal was to have something to 
eat t hat day. And t hat was -- so sur vival 
was the long-ter m goal . But I real l y can't re
member that they said it, or fo r that 
matt er that t hey had t o say 
it. I think they prob
a bl y kne w that I kne w what  had t o be  
done. 
Q: In list eni ng t o your  test i mony that y
ou ga ve on video tape, I wa s str uc k by how you 
were able to be in a situa
tion and make t he best of it, 
for inst ance, by becoming an 
errand boy to one of t he Ge r man soldi ers
 or t o a Ka po; or later, ri ght around 
liberati on, you beca me a  ma scot t o a  grou
p of Polish s oldi ers, and e ver y ti me t here  
you ar e i n t h ose  sit uations. How di
d you end up in 
thos e s ituat i ons?

A: You know, i t 's har d t o sa y. I 've ne ver  thou
ght  about it , but  as  I  sai d, I 'd grown up i n  
the camp and it seemed that sort
 of t h e -- that t her e were cer
tain things yo
u had to do 
in or der t o be a ble t o s urvi ve, and i n 
or der t o be in t he posi tion where you c oul d 
survi ve , a nd thos e t hings sort of ca me  nat u
rall y. I don't  know, I must  s ay I 've neve r  
thought about it. The mascot pa
rt -- this was after liberati
on -- there that was really 
not pl anned at all orŠbe caus e what happe n
ed was that I was liberated and we me t  
these Polish soldiers and 
they knew that I spoke Polish, and they thought I was  
Poli sh, a nd t hey took me  wit h 
the m. And t he n s ort of the ma
scot part came  naturally. 
So I can't clai m any credit
 for  ha vi ng known what I  
wa s doi ng, a t  that  st age .  
Q: You sa y that  you gre w up in the ca mps, 
a nd cert a inly, when your li fe was disrupte d,  
you were about fi ve I  bel i eve 
--  and t hen, you wer e about t en I  belie ve --  a nd c orre ct  
me i f I ' m wr ong, whe n the la
st pla ce you were wa s  liber
ate d. How did you grow up,  
what happened to you, who wa
s the little boy when
 your life was disrupted, and who 
wa s that boy or boy adult wh
en t he camps were liberated?  
A: We ll, we , of cour se, we r e  alrea dy on 
the run from 1939 on, 
and I r e me mb er v e ry  
little from that period. I was 
born in 1934, so in 
'39 I was fi ve years old. I was a 
scared little boy, that's all 
I reme mb er. I remember our 
crossing the border from 
Cze chosl ova kia i nto Pol a nd a nd worr ying that
 s o met hing would ha ppen t o my fat her  
and knowing my fat her  and 
mother  were very worried
 about what wa s  goi ng t o 
happe n; being fas cinated by 
some  of the ne w la ngua ges  
I hea r d -- Yi ddi s h for  the

first time in my life in Pola
nd. Re all y, I di dn't st art sort
 of facing t he real ity of the 
war and what it meant, and so
rt of the reality of trying 
to survive, until probabl y  
1943, be cause in t he ghetto 
still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they, 
when they di ssol ved t he gh
etto and sent most of 
the people to Treblinka. 
Q:  Thi s is i n Ki elce?  
A: This is in Kielce, in Pola
nd. I was still very much sort 
of part - -  I woul d do what my  
pare nts wa nt ed me t o do and 
I  would be the c hild t hat di
d what had t o be done. And  
in '43 I sort of began to be
 aware that I had to -- even 
though I was still with my  
pare nts -- that I ha d t o do cert ain t hi ngs on
 my own in order to 
survi ve. And t hen, of 
cour se, whe n I  was  le ft  - -   
Q:  Such as? 

A: Such as, well, for example, when we  we
r e  in 1 94 3, we wer e  i n a wor k ca mp , a nd  
when that camp wa
s dissolved, the initial thing was that
 I had to hide in order not to 
be s ee n by t he Ge sta po beca use  they were 
t aki ng all of t he ch
ildren away. An d the n  
what ha ppe ned, I act uall y survi ved t hi s: they s a w me of c ourse , we wer e all  lined up 

on one of these fiel ds in Kiel ce, and t hey
 st art pul ling me , and my fat her pulled me  
back. And then my father took
 me to the chief of the Ge
sta po, who was sta ndi ng in  
fr ont of eve r ybody, a nd s aid to hi m, " Thi s 
is my s on." And t hi s
 ma n looke d at me, 

and I sai d to hi m, in Ger ma n, "I ca n wo
rk." And, you know, it just ca me out of me.  
How do you say i t in Ge r ma n?  ﬁIch kann
 ar beite nﬂ?  And his  response i n  Ger ma n

wa s "Na , das  wolle n wir mal se he nﬂ - -  ﬁLet™s se eﬂ  -- and he let  me live . Thi s was -- I  
wa s the onl y one of the  child
r e n fr o m t h at  -- fro m Ki el
c e who s urvi ve d that way. 
The r e were two other s who hi d in the  hous e wher e they took a ll of the chil dren. And  
that wa s sort of the beginning of my awaken
ing to the fact t hat  I was goi ng to have  
to save my  own life . 
Q: And i n t hat c ase, ins t ea d of runni ng a wa y
 or tryi ng not t o be notice d, you we nt ri ght  
into the belly of the beast. You went
 ri ght  face -to- face wit h t he  danger . 
A: We ll, that, in part, that
 was really my fath
er 's doi ng, who, who, who had s ort of 
anal yze d the  Ger ma ns a n d knew t hat you ha d 
to ofte n confr ont  th
e m in cer t ain ways  
and t hat t he y ha d gr eat, sort of, di ffi culty
 wit h t h eir own propaganda a nd wit h the  
reality. Here was a kid wh
o spoke German 
the way their ow
n children spoke 
Ger ma n , who didn't l ook as Je wis h  as they pe rceive d Je ws to look fr om 
De r  
Stür mer
,  wh ich wa s t he Ger ma n sort  o f pro p
a ga nda  ne wspa per. And s u dde nly to  
have this kid talk to them, it personalized 
it. And I think this wa
s my father's -- he 
sort of contr i bute d t o my  do
ing what I di d. He must ha ve
 said himself, "You have 
to." M aybe he -- I don't re me mber, ma ybe 
he s a id, " Y ou have to tell t he m you can 
work." It c o uld well be , but 
it worke d. And a ft er  that, i n 
Auschwitz again, the fi rst 
ti me , when I worked for the Kapo that
, the Ka po wa s so mebody my father ha d 
known be for e, beca use it  wa s 
a ma n who had be e n in t he gh
etto with us in Kielce 
and was s hipped out of the ghett o to Ausc hw
itz two years be fore we did. So, by th e

time  we came to Auschwitz, 
he was a  Ka po --  qui t e a br utal one. But he tr eated his  
fri ends well , and he s ort of took me  i n. It 
was a t errible sort of 
soci ety, to live. But  
that helped. I also -- in Ki
elce still, I worked as an er
rand boy for the man who ran 
that work camp, and I must -- I don't k
now how that came 
about. But what I 
remember -- I don't k
now whether I told it on tape, I 
pr obably did -- I used to sit  
outsi de his offi ce a nd he would liste n to th
e radi o and I woul d listen, a nd woul d sort 
of report to my par ents on 
the news because we had no ne ws, of course. 
So I became  
the one who tried t o memorize 
all the news t hat I hear d on t he Ger man r adio, and  

report it to my father 
and mother and I supp
ose t hrough the m , to the other  people in  
the camp. I even reported on
 the fac t  that M us solini ha d bee n ca pture d a nd t hey  
didn't  bel ieve me  -- of cour
se  they thought t his  ki
d is imaginin
g things.  
Q: At t hat poi nt , a young bo
y, you mi ght  ha ve fel t  a n gry or
 even intense 
hatred for the 
Ger ma ns . What wa s it li ke t o wor k for o n
e , one- on- one  as an erra nd boy, and how  
did you cope wi th that?  
A:  You know, I  didn't  ha ve t o c ope  at al l, th
at 's t he curious thi ng. 
He was a ver y, he wa s  
very nice to me . He never mi streat e d me. 
But he was quit e brutal . He woul d bea t  
people if he saw them not 
worki ng. And so I fi gured out
 he would do that and s o  
when he ma de his i ns pe ction t our s, I  would 
j ust really s ort of run ahea d a nd ma ke  
certai n moti ons . He had a hat wit h a fe at
he r and I  would moti on to pe opl e  that the  

feather was coming so everyb
ody started to work, so -- b
ecause I had se
en hi m beat

a lot of people if he caught 
the m not working. But he wasn
't, he wasn't, never abused 
me , ne ver mistreate d me. That 's stra nge, you 
know, as a child I reme mber he used to  
have a visit fr om some  offi
cer  of t h e SS who woul d ar rive
 wit h a  bi cyc l e, and he  
would hand me t he bic yc l e, to ta ke the 
bicycle and put it in 
the bicycle sta nd. And  
belie ve it  or  not , in all  thi s envir onme nt in
 whi ch we  live d, I l earne d t o ri de the  bi ke  
with this SS ma n's bicycl e. 
You know, a child is a child.  
Q: And you we ren't  a fr aid t o 
do that that they 
mi ght  co me  o ut o f  th
e tent and see you 
playing with the bike? 
A: I mu st say, I thought about it, but then I 
fi gur ed when he tol d 
me to take it and as  
long as  I didn't bre ak i t , I  was a ll ri ght . You 
know, the fear  fact or 
was not -- the fear  
factor was one of survi val a
nd not of s ort of what c oul d happe n in bet wee n for doi ng 
this or doing that. Because 
I r eall y, when I thi nk bac k, I wa s not a fra id and not  
beca use I 'm not a per son who's not a fra id, 
but because it just di
dn't seem t here was 
any reason to 
be afraid. There were ma ny
 reasons in the camp to
 be a fr ai d, but  not t o  
these  s ort of epis ode s. I wa s descri bi ng t o my
 cla ss --  they as ked me t he  other da y --  
I remember breaking in
 wit h a frie nd  o f mi
ne i n Ausc hwitz a nd i n the kit che n of t he  
SS a nd st eali ng milk, whi c h was the fi rst mi l k
 I ha d drunk, we had a c up of milk in  
two yea r s. And i f we had be en
 c aught we woul d ha ve been
 beaten to death, but it 
sort of: there was the milk
 a nd we ha d t o drink it . 
Q: We re you e v er a fr aid that
 you yours el f  would j ust  arb
itrar ily ge t be aten, or perhaps

be chose n to go into t he cre mat orium?  After all , you s a w this  happen oft e n, every 
day. Di d you i magi ne  that  ha ppeni ng t o you?  
A: We ll, first of all, beat
en. You know, one got beaten 
be caus e one pus he d in t he  
food line, and then they swung the stick 
and I wa s beate n on my bac k, but nothi ng  
really ve ry s erious. No, t he 
fact t hat  one  thought , that  I 
t hought I woul d di e in the re, 
that was a reality. And it happened quite a 
number  of ti me s, wh
ere the risk existed 
and I kne w e xactl y what wa s goi ng to happen. 
As a matt er of fact, I was in situati ons 
where I  thought I  was fi nishe
d, t her e wa s no wa y out . No, th
at fear, and th
at  fear was 
tre mendous . Unt il, you know, 
once I hit a mo me nt
 when I real ized ther e was not hing 
more to do, I  coul dn't es c ape a nymore , 
and suddenly a tremen
dous pea ce ca me ove r  
me , I thought I was goi ng to di e. I had do
ne everythi ng pos sible not to get caught  
and ther e was no escape, and I 
s ort of ma de pea ce wit h myse
l f and wi th dea t h at t hat  
poi nt. But  it didn't  last  ve ry 
long. You know, the 
s urvi val inst i nct come s ri ght  ba ck. 
Q: Let 's move on now to t he poi nt at li bera
ti on, and if you c an, ju
st situate us. Where 
wer e you, how old wer e you, a nd wha t  
ki nd of phys ical s t ate  wer e you in?  
A: I was at liberation, in the concentrati
on ca mp of Sac hse nhaus en whic h is about 20  
kilometers outside of Berli
n. And by that ti me I had su
r vived the death march but 
lost -- I had fr ost bite, a n d wa s ope rat ed actually, in an infir ma r y of Sa chs e nha use n. 
They had sort of a hospital set up, b
ecause it was one of 
these model camps ,  
de monstr ation ca mps , where the y would kee p
 people and could show that they were

actually treating people well
, but at the sa me ti me woul d e xec ute pe opl e and do 
ever ythi ng el se. But it wa s a mo del ca mp, an
d I wa s there . I had two toes a mputat ed. 
And then when the wa
r was comi ng t o  a close , the Ger ma ns de cide d to e va cuate t he  
ca mp. But  t hos e of us who 
couldn't really walk very 
much, and some  pe ople  were  
much sicker than I , we were
 left behind in the hospital. 
And t h e assumpti on was t hat  
they were going to come and 
shoot all of us; t hi s was s ort
 of, we all expected t hat  
wa s going t o  happe n. I was a ble t o move . I 
ha d a crutc h or a c ane or s o met hing, so I  
think I was  operat ed maybe three wee ks be fo
r e, or so. It wa s strange ,  after the  
evac uati on of t he ca mp, it was very strang
e but i t  wa s very 
quiet . And t hen you 
begin to hear artillery fire coming closer
. And I think I went 
to sleep, evacuation 
must ha ve been t he  da y be for e. The next  
mor ning I got  up a nd i t  was  ve ry, ver y  
quiet  except for t he shoot i ng comi ng closer
. I  cra wle d out , went
 out and l ooked up 
and saw i n t he entrance of th
e camp, over the ent rance on 
the inside -- they always 
had a machine gun mounted wi
th SS guards sitting on, and 
there was nobody there, 
the machine gu n was empty. I came back
 a n d tol d pe opl e. Of c our s e, nobody 
belie ved that  this  was  ha ppe ning. And t hen
 we just waited an
d t he shooti ng ca me  
close r . The n  we began hearing s mall  ar ms 
fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in  
the earl y a ft ernoon -- we heard t he gong, t h
e ca mp had a bi g bell in the  mi ddle of  
this fiel d, and a Rus sian soldi er had drive n 
in with a jeep and 
was ri ngi ng the bell  
sayi ng, ﬁ Y ou're  fre e.ﬂ

Q:  In what l anguage? 
A: I don't really know. It
 must have bee n in Russian
, but Russia n a nd Poli sh i s  
relatively close. And the instructions were 
that we were fr ee, 
we c oul d go anyplace  
we wa nte d e xce pt n ot thi s 
way because that 's where the 
Ger mans sti ll wer e, so you 
go the ot her wa y. And th
e fir st thi ng t hat we di d was to
 st or m t he place wit h the SS 
kept their supplie s. And people
, of course , thes e were all peopl e who we re quite si ck  
and eve r ybody dra gge d t he msel ve s t o the  
supply plac e and peopl
e bega n to eat . It  
wa s ver y luc ky for me t h at I coul dn't  eat
. I re me mber finding a pic kle. The r e was  
brea d and everythi ng e l se  and all I could eat
 wa s a pickl e. It proba bly s ave d my li fe  
beca use a l ot of pe opl e ate and not ha vi
ng e aten for a long ti me , j ust gorged 
the mse lve s and got qui t e sick a nd ma ny of
 the m died. I didn't . I just  coul dn't  
swallow. And t hen sort of a 
da y lat er, ther e wa s 
a  young Pole , must ha ve been in his  
early 20s and IŠwe --  decide
d we  were goi ng to leave . So
 we  just  went  o ut o n t he  
road a nd sta r ted moving, the n we were jo
ined by some other 
people , there were  
some wome n, als o fr om -- I don't  know 
wher e they came, bu
t Polish women. An d 
we -- the hous es -- this was the city of
 wher e the camp is, Sachsenhausen, i s  
Oranienberg, and we mu st have
 been i n the area of that
, mo ving away from Berlin. 
The  Ger ma n  house s wer e sta ndi ng e mpty 
because the Germans 
had fled, and often 
time s the tables were still se
t, dirty dishes were sitting,
 and you could just occupy a 
house and we just moved fr om
 one  house t o t h e other, 
until these Po
lish soldiers

came and started talking, they
 talked to the wome
n, of course . And 
then they sa w me  
and they sai d, " Where ar e you 
going?" I said that
 I  di dn't know wh
er e I  was going, I  
wa s tryi ng t o find my parent s. And they 
sai d, " We ll whe r e they woul d be? "  And I  
said, "They wo uld probably be in Poland
," and s o they to
ok me  wi th the m.  
Q: Let 's go bac k a  couple st eps . I ' m c uri ous
 about what else the 
Russia n sai d , what wa s 
that scene, li ke when t he 
Ru ssian soldier gonged the be
ll. Di d people c o me  out a n d  
stand ar ound, then di
d you guys hug each ot
her? Was t here a fee
ling t hat you were  
really liberated at that
 point, or did that 
come a little bit later? 
A: Yo u know wh en I see pictures of peopl
e who ar e liberated by 
Ameri can troops, by 
British troops, they were 
liberate d. We wer e none of 
t hese scenes as far as I  
re me mber. The Russi ans just tol d us, " You
 can go." The r e wa s no e ffor t  ma de to 
help us in a ny way, to provide a ny me
dical s ervices, a nd th
e r e was no hugging. I  
don't re me mber, I me an we felt a gr eat se ns
e of relief because we
 expected to be 
shot , but  none of that  -- it  was proba bl y to
o, in retrospect, it wa
s al most t oo much. It  
wa s har d to belie ve tha t  we were fr ee  after al l this  and tha t  not hing ha d happened t o  

us. No, I don't re me mbe r  these sce n es of 
li berati on. I reall y don't re me mber e ven 
realizing that I was liberated until the 
war was over because everybody started  
shooting int o  the air, and i t came, sort of
, on my bir t hda y. But I didn't have a ny se nse  
of t he tr e me ndous  joy t h at ot
her pe ople must have  experi
enced. I was alone in ma ny 
wa ys . I  thi nk that  i f my parent s had be en
 t here  it  woul d have be en di ffer ent .

Q: And whe n you ha d hooked up with th
e young Poli sh boy a
nd you were  mo vin g  
around in the town outs i de 
of Sac hs e nha use n, di d you feel fri ghte ne d t hat  Ger ma ns 
coul d c o me up a nd r eca pture you, perha ps?  
Wh at wa s the mood like, or were you 
just sitting back with your 
feet up on the table in th
ese homes and having a nice 
time?  
A: We ll, where we were afraid, of course, 
was when we were still
 in the camp because 
we  di dn't know what happen
ed to the Germans, whether they would come back and 
whether it was really true that they had le
ft. But once we were  out, I don't r e me mbe r  
worryi ng a b out it. It s ee me d 
that it was over, and the fact
 t h at the Ger mans had just 
disappeared wit hout a trace, t h
e s oldi ers, must ha ve had t h
at i mpact . But I  just don't  
re me mb er t h at may be  as
 a chil d you'r e liberat
ed, you're fr ee. No, 
I  had no s ense  that 
there was a n y da nger fr om t h
e Germans at that point. Of course, I then ende d up, 
when I was a ma scot, in
 the battle of Berli

-- there was a reall y  
al most  hand- t o-ha nd c o mbat and t here  it wa s quit e danger ous .

you  met so me  sol dier s  fr o m t h

that. Ho w did you me et them
 and t he n what ha ppene d?  
A: We ll, they came to one of

's hard for me to sort of 
remember very cl early
, how it came about that they took me  with them. But they

think -- I don't know whethe

of shoes, but I actually 
obs erve d how you ma ke  shoe s and I helped 
a nd I  probabl y at one point could ha ve

Q: So here you are, you're
 a little boy, probably less than
 six weeks ago you had been 
on a  de ath mar ch out  of Ausc hwitz  and all 
of a sudden you're 
dre sse d, you have a  
uni for m, a nd you're r i di ng a  mini atur
e  pony wit h Polis
h army  division. 
A: It 's - - when you t hink 
about it, it reads lik
e, sounds like, a 
novel  from García  
Márquez ,

 but it's true. And it, the 
strange thing is that the so
rt of, the absurdity of it, 
the c o mic as pect of it ne ver occur r ed to 
me as a child. Its -- you know, a t  the sa me  
time , all of this I thought wa
s going to lead to my  bein
g re unit ed with my pare nts , 
and I never even thought that
 thi s wasn't going t o ha ppe n, t h is wa s all part of a  
proc ess . In t he meanti me  I could eat a nd I 
no l onger had to be afr aid a nd I had fun. I  
had a horse. Actually, on the 
fo od, I should tell you that I, since I had no appetite and 
the Pol es were quite concerned t hat I  couldn'
t eat, they started givi
ng me, at first, a 
hal f a s poon of vodka , t h en a 
spoon of vodka, and 
that  sti mulat ed my
 appetite at the  
poi nt wher e I coul d re all y ke ep up with th
em to drinking vodk
a because i t  was my  
me dici ne. That was sort  of t he onl y li ngeri
ng thing t hat ha d s u
rvived from the camp.

all of that myself. I don™t 
even r e member ever being ta

liberat ed.  
Q: Tell us more about the eating. Wh at 
coul d you eat, and how di d that graduall y 
change? Was there some
 fo od t hat w a s more c o mfo r tin
g tha n others, or when you 
were able to be around la

s with the Poles, the Polish 
ar my divisi on, wer e the r e  some
 t ypes of foods that  you be ga
n t o reall y wa nt to ha ve  
an appetite for? 
A:  No.

e Pol e s woul d drink a l ot  of 
vodka, e at brea d and s moke d 
bac on wi th i t . And t hat™ s  the  s ort of fo
od I  remember eati ngŠ
a lot of bread, and 
bread, of course, I could eat, 
although I really didn™t ha
ve much appetite. But with  
the vodka , I  ate a nd dra n k what
ever t hey di d, an
d I re me mber a lot  of ba con, t hat  the  
pole s us uall y drink thi s with 
vodka. But ther e must  have be
en other food, I j ust don't  
have any memory. The only th
i ng I remember is t hat when
 we stor med that place in 
Sachsenhausen, still, that all 
I could eat was a pickle, and 
I hadn't eaten a pickle for a

long, long time. 
Q: Did it bot he r you t hat you had bee n  depr
i ve d of food for s o 
long?  You must have  
fa nta size d a bout food or  talked a bout it, 
and then you c oul d fi nally e at more fre ely, 
and you were
n't hungry?  
A:  No, t hat never occ urre d t o me. I t  oc curs 
to me now wh en I know
 I shouldn't eat and I 
have what I -- so now it 's much more real . 
No w so often I think, 
oh here's all this 
food that I coul d eat and as a child I wa s 
st arvi ng and c oul dn't  eat it a nd now I ' m not  
allowe d t o e at it or shoul dn't 
eat it. But no, I didn'
t, and I think it has 
a lot to do with 
havi ng, bei n g a child a n d taking a lot of 
these thi ngs for gra n
ted. This was life and 
this is what happened. One 
da y you don't have a nyt hing
 to eat and the next day 
there's suddenly fo od. But I reme mber t
hough, for  years a fter war ds , woul d always  
think that you shoul d al ways ea t be for e 
you di d anythi ng of i m porta nce bec ause you 
never kne w when you were
 goi ng to eat a gai n. 
Q:  Did  y ou fi nd  wh en
 you were younge r, that you ate 
quic kly, a s i f  some one  mi ght ta ke  
the food away fr om you? 
A: That could be because I 
still eat quickly, probably too 
quickly. I don't 
know whether 
it's related to that or not. There were cer
tai n foods  that, you know, bre ad of  cours e, 
to thi s day good br ead is  so
mething that I -- I al ways 
use the example t hat when I  
hear  the  wor d brea d i n Ger ma n  or  Poli sh, 
I  can smell  it. It has 
sort of an emotion 
attached t o i t , wher eas t he Engl ish word fo
r br e ad is a word that
 I learned, it's an

 all the emotion tied up with

 in German, which was all of the things that I was  
depri ve d of and t hat I ne ede d the most. 
The one thing that I 
t hought I would neve r  
eat agai n would be t urni p s because we used 
to get turnip soup in
 Ausc hwit z, wit h a 
little piece of bread whic
h was often the only meal we ha
d. But now I find that even 
well done turn
ip quite good. 
Q:  Ca n t he s mel l of it or t he  t aste of 
it, does it bring back
 me mor y flashe s?  
A: Not anymore. But go
od bread still br
ings back sort of fe elin
g of how wonderfu l it is 
to be a ble t o  ha ve t his , which I didn't  have
 because we really l i
ved on bread. It was 
the most i m porta nt t hing, a nd t o t his  da y, 
I really ca n't ge t myself to throw away 
brea d. Stal e brea d is s o mething t hat I fi nd a
ll kinds of excuses to
 let somebody else 
throw it away. 
Q:  That 's i ntere sting. So inst ead of r ese nt i
ng or hati ng the bre ad be caus e it 's all you ha d, 
you a ctuall y sort of cheris h it . 
A:  Oh, ye s, ver y much 
so. The turnips I hated.  
Q: Does your famil y recogni ze that about  you
, the kind of attac h ment to br ead, and will  
they tease you about it or ev
en get a little frustrated wi
t h you: ﬁ Why are  you hol din g

A: No. The pr oble m is t hat , of
 course, t h ey know t hat  for so
me re a son, it must be poetic  
justice, that bread ha
s the worst wei ght- gaining effect
 on me , and so I ' m not re ally 
supposed t o eat it. I eat hardly any br ead
 except for when I ' m in Eur ope where my  
discipline goes. And th
ey know that. Actual
ly bread and sa usages
, which, of course, 
I can't eat because I had a byp
ass a few years ago. All of t h
e t h ings t hat I missed as a 
child I can't  eat now. It 's a sm
al l price  to pa y for  survival .  
Q: Ca n you tel l  us now about being a you
ng boy j ust l i berat e d fr om Sac hse nhause n a n d  
you have hooke d up wit h this gr oup of Poli sh
 s ol diers?  War is not over and you are  
with them and you go essent
ially into military situations
 with them. Te
ll us about 
that. 
A:  We ll, the fi rst real militar
y situation I got into was, I he
lped liberate Berlin. We came 
into Berlin while the battle 
for Berlin was still raging a
nd we were ca mped in the 
park near where the rocket artillery that th
e Russians had. We 're 
shooting over at the 
Ger ma ns  and the  Ger m ans we re s h ooti ng bac k. And I  sle p t in a n ar mored car  
beca use ther e was still fi ghti ng going on, and as we dr ove int o Berli n, you coul d see 

there  were  Russia n sol d iers, 
dead soldiers on one si de, 
Germans on the ot her. The 
battle was still raging for about two da
ys. But then of c
ourse, the Germans 
surre ndered and we actually took Ge r ma n pr is
oners at the end of t he -- when Ber lin  
fell. But during the battle, you know, peop
le got killed. That was a danger that  
some body c oul d get kil l ed. Actuall y s o
me people fr om ou
r compa ny who had

vent ure d out  on t he stree t  in the  tr uck, 
t he ha nd gr ena de wa s t hrown --  be c ause  th e  
Germans were still occupying 
the houses -- but 
nothing happened 
to me. I didn't 
partici pate  in any of the fi ghti ng, I didn't 
shoot  either. But we were c ounting beca us e  
these r ocket- propelled gr enades that the 
Russi ans had, the Kos cius ko woul d shoot  
out , sort of, six or 12 a t  the sa me t i me ,
 and they were s uppos ed to be  mo ving 
because you can very easily 
locate t h em. And we were co
nce r ned. I re me mber the 
Polish saying that they r
eally s hould be movi ng beca use t he Ger ma ns c o uld find 
wh ere they were and then st
art bombarding us a
nd them. But the Ge
rmans, at  that 
point, German artillery was 
no longer very effectiv
e and nothing 
happened.  
Q: We re you fri ghte ne d at that poi nt an
d you wis he d that you had not hooked up with  
these Polish soldiers? 
A: Oh , no, I didn't wish that
 I hadn't hooked up, but I 'm s ure I  was  fri ght ene d, natur ally, 
yea h. It 's a l ong ti me ago, whe n you think t h
is is  in 1945, lat e April, begi nni ng of  
May of 1945; it's a long ti
me.  B ut I  re me mb er 
the concer ns t hat 
we  all had about 
German artillery hitting us. 
Q: Wh at was it like for you to see the Ge
r ma n sol diers br ought into cust ody, take n  
prisoner s?  What wer e your f
eelings toward them? Did y
ou fe el like you wa nte d to  
go up a nd sa y s o met hing to t he m abou
t what  you had experie nc ed yourse l f?  
A: We ll, I was delighted obvio
usly, that they were
 pr isoners of war and we were bei ng 
guarded. I don't reme mb er, fi rs
t of all, I don't reme mb er 
any of the Po
les attacking

any of the German pr
isoners, and I don't reme mb er ha
vi ng t h at feeli ng. I  re me mber 
havi ng t hat feeling ve ry much
 when I came back and I wa
s reunited with my mother  
in Ger many and se eing --  we ha d a ba lcony 
in that town, my mo
ther's home town in 
Ger ma n y, i n  Got tingen - -  and sitting 
on t he balc ony on a Sunda y and se eing t he  
German families taking a walk 
and my father hadn't come 
back. And at 
that point ,  
you know, the desire of sort of seeing -- 
when I fir st came ba
c k I woul d love to 
mount the machi ne gun on that
 balcony and shoot all of th
em. But if I think back in 
Berli n of t he  Ger ma n pr i soners we t o ok, I 
didn't have that feel ing for some  strange 
reason. It ma y have bee n too di stant or– I re me mber ther e we re negotiati ons goi ng  
on for t he surrender of the 
Ger mans , a nd at one  poi nt 
it looked there was some 
danger because t here was a wh
o l e fo rest full o f Ger ma ns as we wer e  mo vin g ba c k  

and our company was quite 
exposed but the Ger mans wa
nted to surrender. And 
these negoti ations we nt on all ni ght and I 
slept through the whol
e thi ng and when I 
woke up i n t he mor nin
g, most of the Ger man offi cers 
had merely negotiated in order  
to be able to escape. That 's al
so I re member fro
m t hat episode. 
Q: Did you tal k  at all about 
what you ha d just we
nt t hrough or di d yo
u pl unge yoursel f  
into this new life? Did anyone say, "What was it like for 
you to be in one of the se  
concentr ation ca mps? " Wa s an
ybody talki ng t o you about t h
at at that point or di d 
you fe el a  ne ed, a  de sire  t o tal k about  i t ? 
A: No, actually I don't th
i n k anybody wa s tal king about 
it because, of course, these

people  ha d come  out of a Russi an c onc en
tration camp, they ha
d gone through the 
entire war , t hey knew what it was all  about.
 I f pe ople ta lke d a bout anythi ng it woul d 
be al wa ys to say, ﬁ Wher e are you fr om?  
ﬁ Where  are your pa rents?  ﬁ Wha t did you  
do? ﬂ Ther e I al wa ys ha d to be
 very care ful bec ause  I didn'
t want -- first of all, I 
wa sn't sure it  was a good idea to s ay t hat I wa s Je wis h, a nd se cond I didn't  think tha t  
it was a good idea t o say I was bor n in Czech
osl o vaki a, s o the y just a ssumed that I  
wa s Polis h. And s o I sort  of 
structure d my own st ory that
 I came fr om Kielce, whi ch  
wa s the ghet to wher e we  had bee n, a nd t hat 
I e x pecte d to find my pare nt s bac k i n 
Kiel ce. That  was sort of th
e extent of that conversati
on, but I must say, I don't  
re me mb er v e ry mu c h o f  that  
period. It 's  strange;  I have 
memories, sort of epi sodi c  
me mory, but  not c h
ronol ogic al me mory. So t hat  I, if
 you say, "Well 
what did you do 
then a nd what di d yo
u do the n,"  it 's often t hat  
I j ust  si mp ly  d on 't  re me mb er .  
Q: Actually something you just said raises
 a questi on. Did you feel J e wish and i f s o, 
how so?  I mean, had you been able to in 
any wa y affir m your identit y as a Jew i n  
this peri od or were  
you really too little to have be
e n give n t hat  by your  par e nts?  
A: No , I felt ver y muc h tha t  I wa s Je wis h  but
 it 's stra n ge, my  fa mi
ly was not a religious  
fa mi ly at all .  I had no re li gious educat ion at all . Re ligion and Judais m beca me part of  

survi val  for  me  and I  thi nk t hat was part 
o f w hat  my father , my  fa mil y b r ou ght me  
up. The Ger ma ns wa nte d to kill us because we
 were Je ws and we wer e goi ng t o wi n 
this battle with them as Jews
 a nd we wer e  goi ng t o surviv
e. And so the Judaism that 

Thomas Buergenthal 
22 
November  28, 1995 
Page 22 
 

 
 
was instilled in me was the Ju
daism that said that we 
were going to win over the  
Germans, we're not going to let them kill us
 and we were going to be proud of th e 
fact that we can sur vive. I 
re me mb er my  fat her al wa ys 
s ayi ng, " We are goi ng t o be  
alive long after they are six fe
e t  unde r." So in t ha t  sens e,
 Judaism, the 
fact  that we 
wer e di ffere nt, wa s part  of the t hing that
 hel pe d us li ve . That was ver y strongl y 
instilled in me. But never reli
gious, never fro m a religio
us point of view. But my 
fat her was very much, very st
r ong as a beli ever t he fact 
that he was a Jew, but not a 
religi ous  Je w at
 all, neither was my mother. 
Q: Wh at happens after the Po
lish army  division 
pulls back fr om th
e battle of Berlin? 
What  ha ppe ns t o you?
 What  is going on
 at t hat  point? 
A: We ll, we pul l  out of Berl in, e vent uall y
 we are put  on trai ns, a gain on trai ns, end u p  
in an army camp in Poland
, in a town called Siedlce, 
sort of a military garrison 
wh ere I stay, I don't know really how lon
g, it must have bee n a fe w wee ks. But one  
of the Je wish sol dier s fr
om that company, wh
o  kne w t hat I  wa s Je wis h  and wit h  
whom I spoke, the n take s me t o a Je wi sh
 or pha na ge in Ot wock, near Wars a w, which 
shows you t hat I hid my Juda
is m one wa y but as  far as t h
e Jewish soldi er and I were 
concerned, I kne w t hat I wa s Je wis h a nd he 
kne w t hat I wa s Je wis h. And he took me  
to this orphanage where 
I stayed for a good year 
until I found my mother. 
Q:  We re you sa d t o be t ake n 
a way fr om t he ar my ga rr ison?  
A: Oh, in so me ways
, yes, because I have 
this sort of wonderful
 military life. Yes and

no. I -- agai n, you know, the stra
nge thing is, i s you a sk t h
ese que stions . Part of my  
life or the way I used to think was that th
ese t hings ha ppe ne d - -  
and you di dn't spend 
much time thinking about 
them, very little intr
ospection about ev
ents. You -- like, 
it's sort of like swimmi ng. You're downstrea m,
 this is part of what
 has to be done. It 
never occurred t o me that I 
shouldn't leave. He said it 
wa s a  good idea t o go t o t h e  
orphanage  a nd I we nt with hi
m. The  or pha na ge wa s a c tual
ly, a lot of it was quite  
nice . Or pha nages  s ound t errible  but t his on
e wa s wh ere  we were 
treated quite well. 
That poi nt is  whe n I began to think t hat
 I would fi nd my pare
nts. Again you know, 
as a child there was a strong belief 
t hat  I woul d fi nd my par ent s.  
Q: De scribe arri ving at the orpha na ge. Wh
at did it look like? Wh
at did you look like?  
We re you in your littl
e military uniform 
at that point? 
A: You know, I should 
have brought a picture. I still 
have a picture of my military  
uni form with this Polish sold
ier who eventually I think we
nt to Israel. I must have 
beca use  I ha d nothi ng els e, s o I must have 
arri ved that wa y. I don't r eall y r e me mbe r  
the arrival part but I do remember that I wa
s sort of -- and that 
made it easier. I was 
the onl y one  ther e who had bee n in t he c a m
ps. All the  ot her kids  ha d bee n hi dden  
some pl ace or had 
come from Russi a or so
me pl ace. So I was sort of an oddit y and 
there wa s a lot of people asking questio
ns , how was t his . And the treat me nt was  
wonderful. I was still very th
in and underweight

An d,  there were the real orphans,  and I 
was considered one of
 t he re al orphans,  
without a mother and a father
, a nd we were  the  tough ki ds
. Th en t here  wer e  what  we  
considered t he weakli ngs becau
se t hey had one parent but  
for some r eason t hey were 
there . And, I  wa s the younge st of t hat  gr

And agai n, sort of, unt hinki ng

Q: Whe n you descri be your sel f being i n  
the group of t he t ough orpha ns , it sounds li ke  
when you were young, 
when you were ten and j ust co
ming out of the concentration 
camp, ther e was al most a certain
 amount of pride,
 that you ha d surv
ived and 
that you 
coul d handle  yoursel f in t hese situations. 
Al mo st kind of the fe elings of a young ma n 
and after all you were
 still a li
ttle boy. 
A:  No, I thi nk t hat was very true. I thi nk that
 wa s in part be cause  
I saw, and because of 
my parents, I saw the 
fact that I  survived 
as a victory, t hat we
 ha d won over the m.  
They wanted to kill us and we
 made it; we 
didn't give them the 
joy of killing us. So 
there was a t remendous sense 
of satisfaction, that of surv
ival, unli ke wha t  one r eads

had that  feel ing and ne it her 
did my mother  be ca use my mo
ther sur vi ved. I mean we 
fel t very bad that , for exampl
e, my fat her didn't  survive. 
He di ed j ust  shortl y be for e  
the end of the war. But we ne
ver felt that guilty about the 
fa ct of surviving, on the  
contr ary. We  were, it was  a s ens e of s atis f
acti on that we had su
rvived. Really it was 
a se nse  of vi ctory, t hat  we di dn't l et t h e m kil l us. 
Q:  That 's  a n i nt eresti ng thought , I ' m not
 sure I 've r eall y hear d t hat  befor e. 
A:  I've never heard 
it. All I read about is people f
eeling guilty that 
they survived. I 
mean I  can underst and t hat, 
I ca n under sta nd it  in s o me wa ys, ot her wa ys I can't  
underst and t hat. I f you s urvi ve, hone stly t h
er e 's  no re ason you shoul d feel guilt y a nd 
we c ertai nly didn't . And r eally t he pe ople 
tha t  I know fr om the 
ca mps ne ver  had that  
fe eling. 
Q: You s aid t h at you playe d ga me s at  t he 
or phana g e. What kind of ga me s, and what  
was that like for you? After all you'd been
 wor king, you'd be en
 an erra nd boy, you'd  
bee n a  mas c ot t o a n a r my di visi on. What  
was t hat li ke  for  you
 to have  your da y 
fill ed with ea ting a l ot  of food a nd pl aying?  
A: It wa s wonderful. You know the strange 
thing is when I think 
back, here I  had my 
toes amputat ed and I played soccer. I pl
ayed a l ot of soccer , and I had the great 
advantage because of my
 amputati on I could al so shoot 
wit h  my l e ft foot , so I was 
one of the fe w kids wh
o could shoot left  and 
right. It -- the trans
ition wasn't difficult 
at all. It was an easy tr an
siti on. It would ha ve bee n 
muc h harder the other wa y

around. That  is, I thin
k, an i mporta nt  thing. That  I, i f
 you were my a ge ,  the post  
survi val peri od a nd the adjust me nt and t h
e sur vival peri od was all mu ch easi er  
because in t he camp I never thought  like 
other peopl e must have, my pa rents , how  
wonderful it was to eat
 a good meal or anyt hing of th
at sort . And missi ng a ll of t h e  
conve nience s that one ha d, I couldn't take it 
today. I 've ofte n thought that I  couldn't  
survi ve toda y. But as a c hild, fr om my poi nt
 of vi ew, things got bad but t hen they 
got so muc h better . And, I ne
ver t hought bac k t hat  there  was a ny --  it ca me  nat urall y 
and I didn't think about it. 
Q: How much did pe opl e a sk 
you about what  your  life had 
been like, fo r instance, in 
Ausc hwitz, and did you have a 
fe eling that they were tryi
ng to find out information 
perhaps for l ater, for war cri me trial s or pe
r ha ps j ust to comfo rt you, t o se e if you'd 
experienced any trauma? 
A: Well, i n the orphanage, 
since I was t he only one there 
who had been i n t he camps, 
the people fr om newspapers
 a nd ne wsreels  would come , 
and I was sort of a minor 
celebr ity. Whenever  people wo
ul d c o me t o the orpha na ge 
I would be  trotted out t o  
ask questions. But not because 
they wanted to comfort me 
or anyt hing, i t  was j ust  
somebody -- if they wanted to talk ab
out t he  or pha na ge, this  was  a n e xa mple.  
Act uall y, you probabl y know that there was a book writt en, a diary i n the camp, the 

ma n who wr ote t hat  di ar y a nd 
the excerpt s fr om the diar y, 
the parts that  deal  with 
me , he asked a lot of those qu
esti ons. And whe n he de scri
bes interviewing me in the

hospital about Auschwitz, he wa
s struck by the fa ct that it 
was all sort of reported in 
the matt er of fact way. I - - it
's still like this to this day, 
I t hink in part beca us e of my  
age or maybe I'm just totally insensitive to
 the experience but not very introspective 
about it. 
Q: You wer e s p eaki ng about  the Nor we g ian 
Odd Na nsen. Act uall y he descri bed you as  
a very bea ut i ful young boyŠﬁpr e- Ra pha elit
eﬂ is how he des c ribed you --  and he 
said t hat the  only way he sa w any a nxiet y 
was i n your hands and t hat you had t he  
hands of an old man. 
A: And now I do. No -- a n d he des cribed th
e m as very ner vous ha nds and I suppose  
they still are probably to so
me extent. No, 
he was the onl
y one in the camp that I 
re me mber as king me a bout thi ngs. And I wa
s even -- I sort of 
thought, how strange 
that s o mebody would as k me ab
out t hese t hings s i nce we wer e all livi ng it  and t her e  
wa s not hing very unusua l  about  it. 
Q: And in fact, he wa
s living it also but what struck 
him was that you 
were such a little 
boy a nd that you mi ght  have  
walked wit h a canist er of
 gas to t he cremat ori u m. 
A: Ye s, of c our se, to me t ha t  was not hing 
ver y unus ual or e xtraordina r y, and to hi m i t  
was ver y di ffer ent . He was a wonder ful man 
and one of the fe w diaries written in the  
ca mp on a day-to-da y ba sis.
 I met hi m after the war. I found hi m after the war and 
we stayed in touch until he 
died. He actually sa
ved my life in 
many ways. And I' m 
still in touch, whenever I'm 
in Norway, his son 
and I get together. 
Actually we were

toget her  last  year . 
Q: You sa y that  oft en you descri be thi ngs 
in a matter-of-fact way.
 I wonder t h ough that  
kind of being around death all the time -- you've just described a little bit ago about 
seeing the Russian sol diers and the Ger man
 s oldie rs and you must ha ve s een many 
bodies in the camps. Is that
 s o met hin g  that  b eca me  ma
tter of fa ct fo r you also? 
A:  Yes. Without necessarily 
saying that it 
was matt er-of-fact i n  
a wa y that you just  
don't notice it. It wa s -- the de ath a n d s
eei ng dea t h in the c a mp and seei ng pe ople  
dyi ng c oul d not but a ffect one in t he ca mp. 
But agai n as part of
 the self-defense 
me cha nis m,  you  tr
ie d not to t hink a b out it , you t r
ied not t o s ee it. Although, you 
know, it 's  str ange, I ca n t alk a bout my e xpe
rience in t he camp, I 
can write about it. I  
can't see mo vies about it. I can't read. A lo
t of things they aff
ect me tremendously, 
increa singly so. And I  thi nk in part  be caus
e I  must  ha ve sort  of suppr ess ed a lot  of 
things t hat c o me out now. 
But I 'm struck by t he fact 
how mu ch more, how di ffic ult  
certai n thi ngs are for  me today 
t han they wer e even 20 year
s ago. I, when I just  even 
see a sni ppet of a movie, 
sa y Schi ndler 's List , they
 would show some thing on 
televi sion, I  woul d brea k down. De spite th
e fac t  that I  gi ve  the i mpre ss i on t hat  
not hing pha s e s me , t hat  I  just
 si mply can't 
ta ke . For e xa mple  certai n J e wis h music , 
religi ous music, bri ngs back 
memories of t he camp that ar
e very di fficult for me , for  
example, a ceremo ny  at th
e Holocaust  Museum, to st
ay without breaking down.

Q:   Have  you e ver bee n t o t he Holocaust  Museum?  
A:  We ll, act uall y I 've not be en able . I ha ven't ha d the  coura ge to wal k through. I 've be en  
there , I 've gi ven a tal k, I ' ve been in t h e au
ditorium, but I haven't be
en able to do it. I 
probabl y wil l  one of t hes e da ys  a nd I  want
 to take my childre
n. But I just, I don't  
have the courage. It took me
, well I didn't go back
 to Auschwitz until 
'92, fi rst time I 
went to Auschwitz. Actually, it worked ou
t it was much easier than I thought it 
would be. It wa s much harder
 going back to Ki el ce where I had been in t he ghetto. 
I 'll ha ve to go the Holocaust M us eum, obvi
ously, but I'm afraid of it. That's the 
sa me, I ha ve n't bee n in the Ya d Vas he m e ve n
 though I was i n I srael a nd I c oul d ha ve  
gone, e motionally I ' m j ust  a frai d. 
Q: Ca n you tell us what it was 
like to go back t o Ki el ce, th
at is, where you were in the 
work camp and then there wa
s t he massacre? That
 wa s whe r e you we re i n t he ghett o 
and then ther e was the massacr
e t hat you sur vived t here. 
A: We ll, the strange thing is th
at what we did, my 
wi fe and I, deci ded t o s ort of go ba c k  
to my r oots  and we actually went ba ck t o
 t he pla c e where I wa s bor n a n d we  dr ove  
around. And she  would reco
r d, she would as k me  ques
ti ons and I would tell her  
about things. As we were dr
iving int o Kiel ce, I suddenl y
 re me mb ere d the a ddre ss o f  
the house and the st reet  wher e we wer e 
in the ghett o. I ha dn't

years, I coul dn't rememb er it. It sudden
l y ca me bac k to me . And we dr ove i nto 
Kiel ce, and I  sort of directed her , and I 'm 
a pers on who get s los t  any pla ce. I  get lost  
in Was hingt on, DC, i f I don't
 se e the Was hingt on monume
nt and her e I sort of  
direct ed her wit hin t w o blocks of whe r e we
 were in the ghetto 
and found the house .  
The i nter esti ng thi ng i s - -  you know how c hildre n are -- I ke pt telling he r , "It 's t his  
big house, I don't know, it must
 be si x or se ve n st ories hig
h." Wh en we got to it, it 
wa s a t hree- s t ory buil di ng. It wa s just as dil api date d, j ust 
as terrible as it was when I 
remembered it. And t he faces
 of the people, there wa
s a tr emendous amount o f  
antise mitism in Poland, a
nd in Kielce particularly it wa
s quite bad. We
 were always 
afr aid that if you trie d to escape fr om
 the c a mp you would be ha nde d over to the  
Ger mans. The faces of the people and th
e lack of the fact that ther e was no  
monument any place in the ghet
to to say this wa s the ghet
to. All I could think about 
wa s, I  want  t o get out of here . I j ust c oul
dn't ta ke i t . Thi nki ng t hat my pare nts li ve d 
in this one room in 
t his  house . M y mother  had j ust di
ed and I couldn't 
wait to leave. 
It was  luncht i me  a nd we wer e goi ng t o st op 
and have lunch, I  said
, "I don't want to 
do a nyt hi ng, I just want t o  get 
out of t h is pla ce." I 'd spe nt fo
ur ye ars of my li f e ther e. 
But it was exactly, I mean the 
part of the ghett o, that whol e area -- and the lack of 
any reme mbering, any effort
 mad e  to  re me mb er t h at 
20,000 peopl e ha d lived here  
who had die d. I did go --  we di d go t o 
a museum. We tried to
 fi nd a muse um and I  
aske d for a  book on t he J e wish c o mmun
ity of Ki elce;  eventually they foun d

somet hing that ha d been i ssu
e d, ther e had bee n s o me exhi
bit  I don't know how long 
ago, but t he r e was not hi ng i n t he muse um 
that you coul d s ee. 
This was the city  
museum of Kiel ce, and t her
e was not hing about 
t he warti me  e xperi enc e. A book t hat  
I eventually got -- it's sort of small 
little book about the Jewish community which  
must have been i ssued duri
ng the Communist period. It 
wa s s hoc king t o me , well , 
fir st t he way that  nothi ng ha d c ha nge d, but t hen 
it was sort of totall
y, it's  as if all o f 
this that ha d happe ned t h ere ha d no i mpact 
on the people a nd they di dn't eve n want  
to remember it, wher
eas it was quite different in Au
schwitz. In Auschwitz, I had 
co me in , we we nt fir st.  I wa s in  Birk e nau  
in the ni ce camp i n Au
sc hwitz, s o we went  
in there first .  And I was very
 c oncer ne d how it  would go. 
As  we walk ed in we  sa w a  
sign t hat s a i d, ﬁ A RCHI V ES,ﬂ a nd my wi fe 
sai d , " Why don't  you go i n and intr oduce  
yoursel f? " I  wa s at  thi s poi nt t hinki ng I  s h
ould be writing down
 my  experiences. 
And I sai d, " No, I want t o be a touris t, I d
on't wa nt to bother wit h any of t hat." And 

she i nsi sted, so s he us uall y pr evail s. I we nt
 i n, i ntr oduce d mys elf, a nd the y  took me  
to the di rect or a nd he t h en i ntroduce d me
 to the archivist, and they were  a whole 
group of people who c a me in. 
They wer e at t hat  poi nt actual ly wor king on a st ud y 
on chil dre n in the ca mp. So they wanted
 to know, wher e wer e  you and everythi ng  
else. And then I ha d the m c h

had a ll of t h e -- the y ha d the docu me nt, t h

Q: Thi s was --  you're ta lki ng a bout the 
tattoo that  you got when you di d arrive i n  
Auschwitz. 
A: Right . And what happened then as a re
sult of this activity, the whole thing for me  
became an academic exercise
, so t h en we had a car and t hey put a gui de at my 
disposa l and we went t o Bir ke nau, but 
it was no longer the Auschwitz. So the 
transition was made mu
c h e asier  beca use  of all  the se que stions . 
Q: I wa nt to go bac k to the point whereyou are i n the orphanag

reconne cted wit h your mother a nd a n y detail

A: That 's a wonder f ul st or y bec a us e my
 mother believed that
 I was alive when 
ever ybody t old her t hat i t  c
oul dn't be, but she beli eve d 
it and she insisted. Matter of 
fact, my mo ther walked ba

far from Regensburg -- she 
wal ke d ba ck to Pola nd, t o Kielce , l o
oki ng for me. Ther e we re pe opl e who had -- 
beca use s he  and my fat her ha d sort  of di

 where t hey were

some people  had see n me  at this poi nt or at 
that point. They all to
ld her, " He can't be 
alive , forget  it," you know. 
She ins i sted. Well , my unc le
, who live d here in the  

Uni ted St ates -- my mot her t hen went back
 t o he r  ho me to wn  i n Ger ma ny , wa s ve ry

various s ear ch burea us of Re d Cros s and ot

orphanage a nd in t he or pha na ge -- t he or pha na ge wa s run by Je wis h Communi sts,  
so-called the Bund party, 
wh o wa nte d Je ws t o st ay 
in Poland an
d become  good 
Communists. But the or
phanage had been infiltrated 
by a Zionist organization and 
one of our c ounsel ors was 
a young woma n, a Zi onist 
wo man from the Ha-Shome r 
Ha- Za™ir  move me nt, whi ch i s a  Zi onist 
l abor move me nt . And t he y dec i ded tha t  
thos e of us who wanted to go t o Pale stine 
t hen -- this was i n 1946 - -  we shoul d run  
away fr om t he or phanage and 
we would be pi cke d up by 
the people fr om that group 
and then taken to a kibbutz in Poland and 
then eventuall y be 
shipped illegally to 
Pale stine. And s o, t he pr oce dure wa s  that 
every wee k or so, one
 kid who wa nted t o

wa nte d to go, put our na me s, 
tell them that we wanted to
 run away, so  they ma de a 
list with our names. Bu
t I wa s tol d t h at since I ha d be

away t hat woul d real ly draw 
attention to the whole thing, 
s o I  had to be t h e last one  
to run away. But the list with names was se

it was sent to the  
Jewish agency in Pal esti ne an

in Germany and then to the British zone in Germany wh
ere my mother was. That 
wa s in De cemb er of 1946, so
 i ma gine, I  was  se pa rated 
from my mother  i n 1944. 
Q: Do  y ou  re me mber  th e mo ment  t hat  so me o ne ca me  a nd  tol d  yo u,  " Y our  mot her 's  
alive , s he 's  i n t his pla ce a nd we
 a re going to take you to her? "  
A: Well, that was actually very di fferent . 
I recei ved a letter in Po
lish supposedly fr om 
my mother, written in 
handwriting, curious 
enough I could not 
really read, but I 
kne w my mother 's  ha ndwriti ng, a nd I kne w th
at my  mot her  d i dn 't
 write Polish. And  
I thought it was a tric
k beca use eve r y so ofte n people
 tried to adopt us fr om the 
orphanage so t his l etter  came
 supposedly fr om my mother
, de lighte d that  s he found  
me a nd s he wa s goi ng to get me
 out of there. And I was sure that wasn't my mother. 
It wasn't unt il I recei ved a le
tter from my mot her in Ger m
an t hat I knew it  was my  
mother . You see , we c oul dn't tal k on 
the telephone. No ne 
of that existed. 
Q:  So it was your mothe r. 

A: It was my mother but she 
had some body el se writ
e the letter in Poli
sh t hinki ng t hat I 
had forgotten my  Germa n or si
nc e it  wa s goi ng to Pola nd. 
Q:  And what  di d t hat l etter  s ay?  

A: We ll, I really don't reme mb
er what it  said. I wis h  I had 
kept it. Actually the letter 
wa s wri tten by a ma n who was 
i n the ca mp wit h  us who 
l ater became 
my mother's 
second husband, a wonderfu
l ma n, a doct or. The onl y survi vi ng doct or fr om -- who 

then died unfortunatel y i n '4

 I knew my  mo ther couldn't

Q: So the orphanage said, "F

d now I'd like to know a little 
more detail about getting smugg

should have  been eas y for you to be  re

agai n i n t hese dangerous situati ons. 
A: We ll, nothi n g wa s eas y a fte r the war . I had no pa pers for one t hing, no pa s sport s -- 
you would have had t o  have visas  and

and I was s u ppose d to follow he

this, the revolvi ng door wa s so methi ng I ha
d ne ver see n be fore. We ll, we  stayed i n  
Pra gue for a  fe w days and the n again we t o

there wa s a not her gr oup of bor der  s muggler s fr om a Je wi sh or ga nizat ion c alle d

 she couldn't wait -- in  
anot her t o wn. We ll -- a n d the n you know, the n 
I j ust c oul dn't belie ve it at t hat point , 
that 's when t he r

Q:  So , resume , how did yo

A: I don't know how she recognized me , 
but I recognized her

Q: Do  you reme mb er some  of the first th

thing. 
Q: So  then your mo
ther took you home. Had you ever
 been to where 
she was li ving 
be for e ?  
A:  No, because actually, 
even though my grandpare
nt's house s
till stood, my 
grandparent 's were forced to 
sell it and my 
mother lived in an 
apart ment in a nice  
house  in town a nd li fe  s u dde nly beca me
 normal after all of those years. 
Q: And, in a  se nse , it  ha dn't  bee n that  
long since you hadn't  se e n
 your mo ther but i n  
anot her s ens e you ha d become esse ntially 
a ma n who fi gure d  out
 how to ma ke his  
way in the mi ddle of thi s wa
r . How did she react  to that
? You must have been very 
independent by that
 point, not her 
little boy anymo re. 
A: I don't know whether that's true. I reve
rted to being her little 
boy in many 
ways. But 
it 's i ntere sting be ca use I  s pent  -- we had t o 
think of school and a
ll of this -- and I had  
a year, a little more than a y
ear of private tutoring from
 a retired German teacher, 
and he said that he couldn't ge
t over the fact that I would 
be a little child in one sense  
and a gr own ma n i n a not her when we dis c
us se d t hings a nd I i m
agine that was the 
sa me wit h my mot her . Al tho ug h, wit h  my 
mother , we dis cus se d -- t here wa s a l ot of 
re mi nis cing about t he ca mp, you know --  
wh ere wa s th is,  wh at 
ha ppene d. But I  was  
a chil d, I pla yed, I di d e v erythi
ng. I wasn't at t hat poi nt 
-- this wa s in 1946, 1947 --  
how old wa s  I?  14, 13 ye ars ol
d. I c o uldn't spe ak Ger ma n t oo well . Again, this wa s  
sort of the interesti
ng part; it took me a while to get 
bac k int o Ger man bec ause I had

spoke n muc h mor e Polis h tha n Ger m an, and 
it took me sort of a 
month or  two to be  
fl uent  again in Ger ma n e ven t hough a t  ho
me  we used t o s pea k Ger ma n a nd Poli sh. I  
spoke Ger m an with my mother  and fat her 
when we were together and Polish with 
my fat her  when we were alone. 
Q: An d so  th ere  was a kin d 
of --  let 's cat ch up and what
 ha ppe ne d t o you. Where  you  
did sort of sit down 
and j ust r eall y de brie f with ea ch other?  
A: Ye s. And t hi ngs  would c o me bac k a n d y
ou woul d talk about t his
 or that a n d anot her  
thing that is so interesting, people often th
ink that when people get together from a  
camp, all we'd  talk ab
out were all  these terribl e t hings
 t hat happene d. The trut h of  
the matter is that we ofte
n laughed about things in re
trospect, about things that 
happe ned t h at wer e funny, a bout this  or 
that happened. So the human spi rit -- you 
couldn't take all this if it 
wer e onl y re mi nisc enc es about all the terrible t hings. So my 
wi fe often sort of marveled 
about t he fact t hat even in 
recent years when my mother 
and I woul d get toget her we 
woul d tal k about t hes e things
 and talk about them often 
and  re me mb er thi s  fun ny  thi ng,  a nd  r e me mbe r  th i s . It  was n 't  o nly re me mb ering  th e 

terrible things that had ha
ppened. I imagine it was pr
obably when I was little we 
talked more abou
t those things. 
Q:  Bec ause a fte r all li fe  does  ha ppen. 

A:  Of course . 
Q: At that point what did 
you know about the fate of you
r father? Wa s it still a my stery,

and i f you di d know a nyt hi
ng, how did you know it? 
A: No, at that poi nt my mo
ther alr eady kne w that  my fat her had not sur vive d. It 's  
strange because I had al ways be
lieve d that my fat her would 
survive. It 's strange, my 
mother was not well, my moth
er had thyroid condition so 
I assumed that
 if one or 
the other  of t he m wa s goi ng t o s urvi v e it 
was going to be my 
father who was goin g 
to survi ve because he was al
so, he was very st
r ong and ver y healthy. But he was 
executed three days before t he war su
ppos edly ende d, in a not her  ca mp, i n  
Flossenburg, wher e t hey execut
e d a  lot of pe opl e j ust be fore  the e nd of the  war .  
Q: So that was a situati on where perhaps th
e Ger ma n s were goi ng to surrender  or leave  
and they just emptied out 
the camps by killing people? 
A: I unde rsta nd that he was  in the group, the r e wer e order s given appare ntl y to not let  
any of t he pr isoners -- most of the c a mps 
fall int o  -- be liberat ed. And whe r e he wa s 
the order was executed, i n fact. 
Q: Ho w di d y o u fin d th at 
out?  Di d pe ople tell you tha t  
who wer e there or di d you 
research it later in life?  
A:  No, I didn't  find it out , my mo
ther  at  t hat poi nt already knew. 
Q: So was t her e a point -- t h en fi nall y you 
kne w about your father
 -- where you stepped 
bac k and took a sort of ti
me  t o mourn hi m in any 
wa y, you a nd your  mother  
toget her?  I ' m not s ure  how. 
A: Yo u know it's strange but
 li fe wa s s o unordi nar y i f yo
u wa nt, that you didn't mourn

in the  sa me  wa y. It  was a los s, you know, 
we lost  so ma ny pe ople . It wa s a terrible  
thing that my father hadn't 
survived. It was so mething 
that I still fe el today but 
mour ning wasn't s o met h ing 
one did i n the wa y one doe s 
for example, i f somebody 
dies and one goes thr ough this peri od. It 
was a reality one si mp
ly accepted, added to 
all the  ot her  things t hat had ha ppe ne d. 
But one didn't mour n the  way we do i n  
ordi nar y, e v eryday li fe. That  si mply didn'
t ha ppen. I ' m s ure wh
en my mother first  
found out, it must ha ve been e xtre mel y di ff
icult. But by the time 
I was r eu ni t ed with  
my mother I think I -- I don't know when
 or if ever, on the one hand I always  
belie ved I was goi ng to f i nd my par e nts, but 
at t h e sa me  ti me  I must  h a ve  at s o me 
poi nt in the orphanage a l ready concl u ded t hat
 I woul dn't be re unite d, t hat neither of 
the m l i ve d. 
Q: Whe n you t hink bac k to
 when you finally got t o  Ge
r ma ny a nd you're with your  
mother , thos e fir st fe w days , 
and you're looking ar ound a
nd all  of a sudde n your li fe  
is beginning to look a li
ttle more normal, do you, I 
mean, was ther
e one moment 
when you s ort of re me mber
 l ooking ar ound, maybe goin
g t o a ma rke t  wit h your  
mother  a nd s aying, " Oka y, this  is  pr et
ty normal, my life
 is normal now?" 
A: No, you know. I t hink I ass u me d that 
my li fe  had be en no
r mal fr om the very 
begi nni ng. The fact that it  wa sn't nor m al wa
s part of it bei ng nor ma
l, this was all part  
of the li fe t h at I ha d li ve d. I me an you wo
uld t hink tha t  going bac k to Ger ma ny for  
exa mple, woul d be di ffi cult. It wa s di ffic u
lt. It was very diffic
ult initially for my

mother but t his was the onl y place she real
l y could go bac k to. M y mother always  
told t he stor y with a ver y ba d c onsci ous
, very guilty, bec ause  
she was sta ndi ng on 
the street  cor ner i n her home
 town and an old lady came  
up to her and asked her to 
help her across the street and my mot her 
sai d, " N obody hel pe d my mot her  acros s the  
street in this town." This was right afte
r she came  back. Then
 for year s she would 
talk about it and say 
how terri ble it  was t hat she  had 
acted that way.
 So  you know, 
we had all of those feelings. 
But then I went there to school initially but at first the 
thought to go with these 
kids whose fathers had kille
d my father. But then you 
realize that these are people you don't know 
whether they killed yo
ur father, most of 
the m proba b ly di dn't , a n d you make fri ends.  And you fi nd for  exa mple , we live d i n 
the house wi th s o mebody, who 
was, a Catholic family that
 ha d act uall y he lped the  
Je ws i n t o wn, ha d bee n in danger the mselv
es . And so that  s ort 
of abstr a ct hatred 
becomes transformed into the 
fact t h at they're 
huma n bei ngs  regar dles s of whet her  
they're Germans or no
t Germans and not ever
y German was guilty. 
Q: Wh en you fi rst got ther
e  and you ha d to brush up on
 your Ger man and you had a  
Ger ma n t ut o r, how did you f
eel about that? I mean you we
re after all lear ning this 
langua ge tha t  you must , a t  th
at point , you mi ght have a sso
ciate d wit h the ca mps a nd 
kind of negative things. 
A: But reme mber, it was al
so the language of 
my  mo ther. I've never made that 
associati on. I al ways ha d terri ble  tr ouble
 seei ng Ger mans i n  uni for m but not  the

langua ge. And it wa sn't a prob
le m t h en. But of c o urse the di ffi culty wa s that one di d 
someti me s see t ype s on the st
reet  that remi nded
 one  of the SS a nd other s , s o t he y 
probabl y we re. M y mother would e v ery s o
 often look at some
 woma n walking by 
and say that  she must have been a ca
mp gua rd. And you kn
ow, those me morie s  
would i nva ri ably c o me back or peopl e 
would ma ke some r e ma
rks or people would 
see her number. She al ways wo
r e short slee ve s a nd people woul d sa y to her, " Don't  
you thi nk you s hould have t his tatt oo re
moved? " And she would sa y, "Thi s is a  
badge of honor , I woul d never re move t his."
 You know, a nd she  ha d a  lot of t he --

Ta pe  2 , Si de  B 
 

-- lived in Italy, starting I th ink in 1953 until she died. Ev
ery so often if she would  
see a Ger ma n tour guide, she woul d ma ke s o me s ort of re mar k but at the sa me ti me  

she was very forgiv
ing in ma ny wa ys. 
Q:  Did you ever consider
 re movi ng your  tatoo?  
A: No. But I think it 's, it 's -- and nobody to
ld me to, that it would be a good idea if I 
re moved i t . But  I t hink you'd
 tell it to -- she was a ve
ry pre tty woma n and so I  
suppose it was a nat ural thing to s ay, "S
houl dn't you r e move it? " But no, she was  
very wonderful, she was a ve
ry little person. She was less th
an five feet tall, very

Q: Whe n you wer e begi nning to int egr ate 
yourself into this Ge
r ma n  to wn , h o w o p e n  
wer e you a bout be ing Je wish
, a bout be ing a s urvi vor of t he ca mps a nd wa s it  
something that people talk
ed about or were people 
sayi ng, " Some  of that 's  
exaggeration, it didn't really 
happe n" ?  Wh at was  goi ng on
 then in terms of your  
experience? 
A: First of a ll, we were ver y pr oud of be
ing Je ws  a nd being s ur v
ivors. And of c ours e  
you know, my mother 's  
fa mil y wa s known. Thi s  was a s m
all  town, thi s is  a fa mous  
uni versit y town, it had 
50,000 inhabi tants but
 my  mothe r  gre w u p
 in that town and  
we wer e  kn own. I wa s the o nly J e wis h ch
il d i n the sc hool  and the Ge r ma n ki ds  
would s o met i me s look at  me and sa y, "You
 don't look the ways
 Jews ar e supposed  
to look"  be c ause  thei r only noti on of Je ws
 were these cart oons t hat t hey had seen.  
The kids, you know children
 are children. I never expe
rienced any antisemitism in 
the school , never  ha d any se nse . I 've e xpe
rienced antisemitism mo
re in ma ny other  
place s, but never in school i n Ger m any. 
People said t he y di dn't know. The only

incident real ly that I r e memb
er in school was, of cour se
, the t eachers tri ed to avoi d 
spea king a b out t he war altogethe r . It  wa s 
ne ver me ntione d i n his t or y cla ss. Hi stor y 
wa s ta ught. You s poke a bou
t the German myth
ol ogy and t he 17t h, 18t h c e ntur y but  
never a bout the 20t h ce ntury.
 That  was neve r ta ken up. 
But in one class, I don't 
know whet her it wa s e ve n a hist ory c lass, bu
t t he issue came up 
of the bombing of 
Dre sde n and Ha mburg a nd t he  teac her was  sa ying how t erribl e tha t  was  a nd I  rai sed  

my  hand and I said, " Well, if you're going 
to talk about that, w
hy don't you also talk 
about all the  other ter ribl e things that 
you pe ople did," and all 
hell br oke loose . The  
teacher got very huffy initiall
y and then, of cour se, worri
ed because t his was right  
aft er t he war  and t hey had to
 go t hrough de nazi fi c ation a nd all  of t he se t hi ngs . Then 
he ca me at s o me point t o  our house a nd 
a pol ogiz e d. But t hat wa s the onl y incide nt 
whi ch t his matter eve r  ca me up. Of c ours e, th
ey tried to never talk
 about it . The ki ds  
would some t i me s as k, ﬁ What 's this number?
ﬂ and ﬁHow bad wa s 
it?ﬂ Because t hese 
are kids my age. 
Q:  What  would you tell  
t he m, would you be honest?  
A: Oh, yes , I woul d tell t he m 
this is what ha ppened, and then they would tell me that 
their father was -- you know, so
me of the kids' fa thers were
 prisoners of war. But it 
wa s cur i osi t y mor e tha n, but I ne ver had t he 
sense of any sort of
 antisemitic feeling  
or a ny se nse  of, " O h, it 's  a pity that y
ou weren't–" Yo u know, 
the usual thing that  
one e xpects is, " How c o me you sur v ived a
nd why did you survive ,
 what a pity t hat

you–"  None of that ever . 
Q: Did you eve r  have a ny fe ar that i f you 
were very open a bout who you were  about a s  
a Je w, or  c onfronte d a ny aut horit y, that
 so mehow the r ug coul d get pulle d out from 
under you again, that
 you coul d be  per secut ed for  being Je wi sh?  
A: No, ne ver . You know t he  st
range thing is that when you 
enter  a class, I learned very 
early beca us e I learne d it in the or pha nage, 
too; in the orphanage, I was the kid who  
wa s se nt to get the mail fr om
 the pos t  office , thi s  was 
i n Pol a nd. Beca use  a lot of 
kids, the Poles would throw st
ones at and attack them an
d yell antise mitic slogans at 
the m. I woul d go a nd pic k up the mai l  and 
nobody wo uld yell at
 me. For one thing I 
didn't look Je wish. But  I re
me mbe r once c onf ronti ng 
somebody and who said  
somet hing a bout me  a n
d the first reaction wa
s  to just  sl ug hi m, a nd I l ea rned very  
early that with all of that, 
the best way was to j u st be ext r e m ely aggre ssi ve and i f 
somebody said something like 
this, you just whopped the m
 one but you didn't act a s 
if you wer e afr aid. And t hat 
was also very effective in 
s chool i n Ger ma ny when you 
enter t he class. I  was qui te
 strong. And so yo
u took on, not becau
se of antisemitis m 
or anythi ng else, but when 
you ca me into a ne w envir onment you had to asser t  
yoursel f a nd so you took on th
e fe llow who was s uppos ed to
 be the strongest. An d I 
remember I was very 
good in arm wrestling 
and I could beat an
ybody so we would 
prove ourselves, you know the 
usua l, al most l ike monke ys a ssert t heir  superiority. 
But I never had a ny proble ms i n school . I

A: Ye s, I was e xtre mel y he a lth

I love d sport s. It wa s all of 
the things that Germ

Q:  Did your mother ha ve a s t rategy for k
eepi ng you healthy in te

a ki nd of concentrated effort? 
A: No, I ne ver had t he se ns e that -- s he let me
 do, ea t what I wanted and at that poi nt in  
the be ginning it wa sn't a l wa ys ea sy t o 
get food a fte r the war  but we al ways had  
relatively good food. 
Of cour se, a ny food we woul
d have ha d wa s good fr om my 
poi nt of view at the ti me but I don't  re

State s you c oul d trade that 
and you c oul d live for a wee k 
on the food that you could

Wa s that  something you were  
following or we

A: We ll, it's interesting you should ask th
at because I reme mber  the Nuremb erg trial s  
onl y to the  exte nt t hat  I re

e this letter to him asking  
wh ether he mi ght know the man who was so

course the mail was  
terrible i n those days . Nothing ha ppe ned for 
a whil e. Then one day t he door bell rings  
and there's a big Norwegian 
military truck outside and th

she s aid, " Gi ve it to me," and t he y sai d, " N o, 
no, no, it 's much t oo hea vy, we ha ve t o

why t he book was de dicated t o me , a mong 
others, because he thought that I hadn't su

actuall y took me  to Nor wa y t o spe n d si

And appare ntly they

Q: Wh en you began to have those thoughts
,  what  wa s y our  mot h er

A: We ll, my mother just thoug
ht that I would go to the Unite

wit h my unc l e and come  back
 and she thought that it wa
s a good experie nce that  I  
should go to Americ a. Am
eri ca was what we i ma gine
d, it was  heave n and you had 
to se e it , it wa s wonde r f ul, but  
she didn't think th
at I would st ay. It
 was hard for her 
when I di dn't , but I tried t o c o me bac k  as 
often as I  could. But  
I think she recognized 
that it wa s the best 
thing for me  to do. 
Q: Tell us about  your unc le, his na me  firs t

A: No, I  ca me  on a boat , on a Li berty boat , t he SS 
Greeley

Gen er al Gre eley

. 
It was one of these, you kn
ow, the tubs that were built 
for a troop transport. It 
was a long trip, I think we were
 at least a week i f not l ong

number of refugees; it was 
immigrants coming. All na
tionalities, all languages. 
We ll, what can I tell you abou
t it? It was actuall
y quite  an int eresti ng tri p beca use  I  
realized agai n the survi v al in
stinct that we talked about.
 People had to wo rk on the

have the newspaper that we
 published on the last day 
on t he arri va l in Ne w York. It
 wa s a very wonder ful gr oup 
of people fr om all over 
including a Kalnick (ph) fa

Russia. I still have some

to pi ck me up from the sh

Je wish wel fa r e ser vice or gani zation who t ook 
me to a house, like
 a sort of halfwa y 
house in the Bronx where  I st

funny t hing that happene d ther e, I a r rived

, "You wa nt to see New

on the subway and the doors 
opened up and they got out
 at  one  st op and I didn't

A:  We ll I had Polish,
 Ger ma n, and Fre nc h, whic h I 've  
ba sicall y l os t  on le arni ng  
Spa nis h; it 's  very di fficult  for  me  now. 
Q: And just to clari fy, the boat t hat you 
ca me over  on, t his wa s for merl y a  group of 
refugees  who wer e give n per mi ssi on t o 
come  over and you 
ca me as  a  gr oup?  
A: Ye s. We ll, what happened 
was t his: t here was a sort of --
 instead of Ellis Island they  
had established a camp
, the U.S. authorities had establ
ished a camp in
 Bremerhaven  
in Ger ma ny, where people who had di ffere nt 
visas to come to the United States as 
refugees were first  brought 
into t hese camps, t heir  pape

ever y fe w weeks  the y woul d have  a ship re

these ships as a refuge e ship, an
d that wa s one  of t hos e s hips. 
Q: Wh at was your first view of the United 
States, literally? Wa s it 
of Ellis Island and 
the Stat ue  of Li bert y?  
A: No , but  it wa s o f the  St at

morning and so we could see th
e Statue of Liberty all lit up
. As a matter of fact in  
the newspaper article that each of us wr ote 
in a di fferent language. I wr ote mi ne in 
German. I noted the lights of 
t he Stat ue of Li bert y and t h
e li g hts o f Ne w Yo rk Cit y,  
which made a tre mendous impression on
 me. I reflected on
 Auschwitz and the  
cremat ory and t he li ght. So 
it was a tremendous mo me nt. 
Q:  So you di d fl ashbac k on Ausc hwitz. 
A: Very mu ch so. I reread it the ot her da
y and I was st ruc k by
 how much I -- t hese 
flashbacks come to me, for ex
ampl e t hey came t o me in 
El Salvador, they come all 

the time. One really 
ca n't ha ve gone thr ough t h at 
experi ence and 
when you s ee  
somet hing si milar, that brings
 it back, of course. I t doesn
't bri ng it back necessarily 
in a negative way. But I saw 
it in connection with the El
 Mozote massacre in El  
Salvador or the killing of
 the Jesuits. These things
 came right ba
ck to me. 
Q: What di d you decide to study whe n  
you we nt t o colle ge?  As we 've pointe d out

college in We st Virginia 
on a s chol ars hip. Whe n di d 
your i ntere st s begi n t o t a ke sha pe?  
A: We ll, it's  strange. Initially
 I thought I wanted 
to be a journalist 
but then I decided 
very early that I wouldn't make  much of a jo
urna l i st in the  langua
ge t hat wasn't my  
langua ge. When I we nt t o Be
thany, I already, I think th
e first year  in Bethany I  
already de ci ded I was going to be a lawyer  and I wa s goi ng to do somet hing relating 
to international things, I didn't have it ve

the science ability or

really the lawyer

ever  at one point  thi nk you mi ght  be  a  tria

A: No, ne ver. I  al ways t ho
ught I wanted to do somethin
g with law and international  
relations of some s ort. But you know, in la
w school -- at least in your first years in 
law school, at least in the days that I went
 t o la w school -- you coul dn't even get a  
cour se in international law in your  firs
t or sec o nd year . It wa s us uall y you got 
electives onl y in t he thir d year so I had my 
first international law 
course in my third 
year of la w school . It wasn't unti l  I we nt
 onto graduate law that I specialized and 
could specialize in inte

yoursel f int e rested i n? 
A:  We ll, in college I was very
 much interested in 
hist ory, partic ul arly
 American history. 
That fasci nation sort of ca
me out of high school, I ha
d a very fine hi gh sc hool 
history course, and th
en political science, internationa
l relations was always there.  
And li terat ure -- I act ua
ll y maj ore d --  I mi nore d i n Eng
lish in college of all things.  
The n i n la w school I wanted t o st udy inte
rnational things but I 
really had only one 
cour se as I me ntione d before , the n I  decide
d t o go on to gra duat e sc hool . I did my  
law school at NYU a nd I we nt on t o Ha
rvard for a masters and eventually for  a 
doctorate in international law. Wh at wa
s interesting, struck
 me, I reread my 
appli cati on t o Har vard what I want ed t o 
do, and in my applic
ation I said that I 
wa nte d to st udy inte rnati onal courts a mong 
ot her t hings, and then I e nded up ser ving 
12 year s on an i nter nati o nal c ourt wit hout kn
owi n g it. It was sort
 of a strange thing, 
but t hat 's what I wa nte d to do. But I 
di d work at Harvard on int e rnational  
orga niza tions I was part icularl y inter est
ed i n. The Eur ope an common ma rket was  
just be ginni ng and I wa s int erest ed in how
 t hat court  functi one
d. The n I di d my  
doct orat e actually on a subject t h at ev
erybody is surprise
d out , I did it on  
international air law. But in
 bet wee n I got  very much in
terested in human rights and  
I wrote one of my  first 
articles on human rights. 
Q: What was appeali ng to y

your teet h i n to it a nd you're s tudyi ng it ev

it. What wer e your reacti ons 
t o it? What di d you l i ke ab
out it , what di d you disli ke  
about it?  
A: We ll, if we're just talkin
g la w sc hool  in ge neral , I  disl
iked al most everyt hing about 
it. I just hated my first y
ear in l a w sc hool. I t hought 
it was much too technical and  
very lacking in -- at least 
the way it was 
taught in those days
 -- very little policy  
orient ation a nd there was  sort of vari ous te
chnical, dry case analysis that didn't , to  
my mi nd at t he ti me , di dn't fo
cus on what I tho
ught were important 
issues. It wasn't 
really until I was able to
 s t u dy wh at I wa s  really  
interested in, which was 
international law. I got intere
ste d, I be gan t o e njoy law r ea
lly in my thir
d ye ar in la w  
school , and t hen i nter nati onal l aw bec ause I sa
w it  as an i nstr u me nt of bei n g able t o 
deal wit h some of the pr oble ms  tha t  I ha
d mysel f  expe rienced. 
And I wa nt ed to s e e  
to what e xte nt la w could play
 a r ole i n pr eve nti ng some  of the se thi ngs. And I ' m not  
sayi ng this i n any sort of philosophi c al se
nse, but I thought I 
had a ba ckground i n, a 
langua ge ba ckgr ound a n d wa s sort of nat u
rally drawn to things international. I 
there fore t hought it woul d be i ntere sti ng to 
see t o what extent various organizati ons 
like the UN, the European Co mmon Market, th
e  Council of Europe
; to what extent 
they're doing something that in
 fact might pr event the reo
ccurrence of t he things t hat  
I ha d e xperi ence d. And onc e I 
got into it, that was the th
ing that really captivated  
me .  
Q: Wh at was the atmosphere at
 that time  -- the sort of attitude about international law -- 

Thomas Buergenthal

was there a fe eling that it 
wa s a n e ffective  tool, or wh
e n you wer e st udyi ng it wa s  
there a di ffer ent feeli ng? 
A: We ll, it depends a little bit where -- when I got to Ha
rvard I had some wonderfu l 
professors of internationa
l law, probably among the best in the world. An d they 
demonstr ated the i mport ance of it and sort
 of opened a comple
tely new different 
world for me. But of c o urse , all the people 
ar ound us, that is to say not in the la w  
school but t he worl d around us 
belie ved t hat all of this r eall y  didn't e xist ,  that the r e  
was no such thing as interna
tional law and that it was to
tall y i rrelevant . And so you 
always had t he se nse t hat  you wer e sort of
 an ac ade mi c who was studyi ng s o methi n g  
that ha d no releva nce t o anyt hing tha t  happened i n the real world. I never  believed  
this, I always thought that 
it wa s much mor e rele vant t han pe ople t hought , tha n the  
avera ge pers on thought , and much more re
le va nt than most 
Ameri ca ns thought . I  
thought Americans pr obably 
ha d a much l ess of a n unde
r sta nding of the i m porta nce

 al most a schi zophr enic aspect when you

" Well, what  are you st udyin

"Does it really exist?" Then

partic ularl y huma n right s and i nter n ationa

70s I real ly worked -- in the 70s I bega

 in human rights matters, then I en
de d up on t he Inte rAmer i ca n Court of 
Huma n Ri ghts where we  dea
lt wit h some very na sty ca ses li ke disa ppeara nces and 
other things. And now I'm 
on the UN Human Rights Comm
ittee, and we'r e doing th e 
sa me. I wa s on the Tr uth Commi ssi on of El 
Sal v ador , all t he ti me while c onti nui ng 
to teac h. So t hat, t o me, i n te
rnational law was never just an
 academic subjec t. I also -
- I have lived it almost all of
 the year s since I be
ga n teac hing. I ' ve als o pr act i ced it i n  
a way, not i n  as a l a w fir m la
wyer but as a international la
wyer working in the fi eld.  
Q: Whe n woul d you say you be gan t o deve
l op a phi losophy of human ri ght s law a nd  
that you saw that e merge in 
your ideals in the kinds of 
choices  you were ma king and 
the case s you wer e bringing?  And wh
at is  your  phi losophy, I suppose?  
A: We ll you know, I 've ne ver brought a  huma
n ri ghts case . I 've always t hought that I  
coul d be much more e ffe ctiv
e i n the human rights area by 
not being an activist in the  
sense of being a lawyer f
iling cases, but an academic 
who could be 
perceived t o  
have a legit i ma cy whe n  he spoke on huma n ri ghts is sue t hat wasn't driven by 
political considerations. It wa
sn't driven by ot
her considerations
 and that had no 
political agenda other than co
ncern for huma n rights. And that ha
s been enabled me,

in fa ct, to be on a human right
s court and be put in positions
 of being able, I think, to 
do a great  deal i n t he human 
rights area, and t o be ta
ke n s eriously in t he huma n  
rights area without being viewed
 as somebody who has a po
litical agenda. I think it's 
very i mport ant for NGOs
9
 and acti vist or ga niz ations to
 do the wor k t hat they're 
doing, but it
's also i mportant for pe
ople to be seen 
as committed to 
human rights and  
committed to the advancement 
of human right
s who aren't political
 activists in the 
fie l d. And I ' ve al wa ys t h ought t hat I coul
d d o  mu ch mor e  b y  
doi ng t hat, by sta ying 
above the sort of political fo ray, and that was partic
ularly important in Latin 
Ameri ca, where from t he beginning i f 
you spoke  about human
 rights  you wer e  
percei ve d t o  be a Communis
t. As a matter of fa ct, I 
founded the  Int e rAmer i ca n 
Institute of Hu ma n Rights in
 Costa  Ri ca, pre ci sely in or
der to legitimate just a  
disc ussi on of huma n rights
,  whic h wh en  I fir s t  ca me  
I wa s invol ve d wit h Latin  
Ameri ca i n t he late 70s, t he di scussi on of 
huma n r i ghts was n 't  a legiti ma te subj ect, it  
just became aggressive political
 discourse between the right
 and the left
. And so my  
sens e has  al wa ys bee n t hat some  of us , 
at  a ny rate, ca n c o ntribute mu ch more  
through teac hing and through s ervi ng as i m
partial arbiters in this fi eld. In the  
teachi ng area, I -- my for mer pr ofessor at
 Har var d and I -- di d the fi rst Ameri can 
case book in international hu
ma n rights. We e sta bl ishe d th
e teaching of international 
huma n ri ght s in t he American la w s chool

be for e t hen onl y t hre e  of us  taught the s u
bject. It's  now tau
ght  in al
most all 
American law sch
ools. And, you know, 
I have a little book fo
r students on the 
teachi ng of - -  on i nternati ona
l human right s, whi ch actuall
y the subj ect has suddenl y  
taken on a life of it's  own 
not onl y i n l aw sc hools but e ver
y pla c e else , which it di dn't 
have when I first started in th
is fi eld in the late 60s. No
body was interested in thi s  
field and i n the int ernati onal -- t he Ameri can
 Societ y of I nt ernati onal --  didn't even 
consider human rights to be a 
s ubje ct of int erna t ional  -- so 
I worked i n bo
th of these 
areas a nd I t hought it wa s always ver y i mpo
rtant. Phil os ophy - -  
that's the philosophy  
I sup po se . T o my mi nd t he mo st i mp ortant thi
ng i n this field i s  not t o let yoursel f be  
politicized; that's the bigges
t danger that I see. Peopl
e who promote human rights,  
when they politicize the subject
, do a great deal of harm 
to the victims 
because they 
then debil ita te the ms elve s in bei ng a b le to prot ect victi ms . Als o I 've lear ne d a great  
deal of patience in thi s fi el
d. It ta kes a fe w li fe
times to be able to achieve anything. 
But , you know, t he mos t
 grati f yi ng t hing is  to --  it 's  oft en oc curre d t o me whe n I  
worked in Zepuan (ph) sitting on the cas
e or when i
nvestigating human rights 
violat ions in El Salvador or now at  
the UN -- to think th
at  some body who had  
survived Auschwitz is given th
e opportunity to be working 
in this field now. It's a 
wonder ful  --  it 's a  gi ft , it 's a bles sing wh
en you t hink about  it , 
you know, that I 've  
bee n gi ve n t his opport unity. It
's e xciti ng and t hat 's what s o
rt of makes this all for me.  
Every time I sit on something that sort of 
bri ngs back t he memory
, it seems to me to

say t hat it 's al most as i f 
there was somet hing wr
itten that I'm supp
osed to be doing 
this. The irony, the poetic ju
stice  of my doi ng 
this, comes back so
 often. It came  
back particul arly i n El Sal vador where so 
many things that I saw reminded me of the 
camps, fr om the massacr es to 
the executions. But to think,
 you know, to 
think of the 
cold Polish winters and the tr
opic s of El Salvador, yet th
e sa me crue lty, and for me 
to be able to be involv
ed in this, it boggles 
the mi nd in ma ny ways. 
Q: I 'm not sur e  most  pe ople woul d ma
ke t hat connecti on unle ss t he y  had your  
experience i n the camps, that 
ther e was a kind of si milar,
 I guess, br utalit y goi ng on 
bet wee n tre a t me nt of pe ople in t he ca mps 
a nd what ha ppe ne d duri ng t he worst of the 
civil war i n El Sal va dor .  
A: We ll, you know, it str uc k me long a go whe n I read Solzhenit syn
10
 books a bout the  
gulag, t hat t he uni maginative cr uelt y, it
's al ways  the sa me . You know, when you  
read what  happened i n t he 
gula gs , you say, "Ge e, t his  is exa ctly what ha ppe ne d in  
the camps."  And t hen i n El 
Sal va d or for exa m ple, whe n
 the only survivor there 
descr i be d t h e mass acre . Whe n s he bega n tal k

her. I was st ruck by the fa
ct that I c oul d ha ve c onti
nue d a b out what ha ppe ne d. It 's  
the sa me , I me an th
is br utalit y and the sa

ere is no -- evil has 
sort of a monot one t o it. I don
't know, that is t he t hing that al wa ys stri ke s me , that I  
just can't  get  over .

Q: Ho w do you think your
 per sonal experi ences shap
e -- how do you 
t hink your  
pers ona l experienc es s ha pe what you actuall y 
de c i de to do in certa
in situations with 
a case? Perhaps when y
ou're sitting on a court -- or mayb
e the link is not that direct. 
A:  The  link i s proba bly ther e and it 's not  ther
e. I n other wor ds , it doe
sn't a nd i t shoul dn't  
shape t he outcome of t h
e deci sion. What it  does, it 's 
you have a  muc h 
better sense of 
the reality in which an event 
happened. It's as if, you k
now, if I were 
a judge sitting 
on a commercial case and I'd 
been prior to that a la
wyer practicing in the 
commer cial law area, I woul d have a much be
tter sens e of dea l ing 
with this material 
than so mebody who came out of
 some other environment. 
Well, it's a little the same 
for me when I deal with 
a human rights case. This is
 a reality. Wh en I hear  
some body descri be a c er t ain sit uati on, the r e 
is an underst anding of what c o uld have  
happe ned a nd als o doubts raise when
 s o mebody tells you somethi ng, you sa y 
whenever t h at doesn't sound right. And 
you ca n ma ke t hose, 
you ca n ha ve those  
doubts  only if you've  lived t h
rough something similar. So 
to that extent there is a  
connecti on, and to that extent
 it's very useful. But it shoul
dn't  a f fe ct your decisi on-
ma king pr ocess . But of cours e, there 
is the empathy that
 comes out of the 
experience, i s there. And I think people sh
oul dn't  be in huma n right s i f they don't  
have some empathy for wh at it is to be 
subjected to violations. But I don't know, 
someti me s you wonder a nd 
you s ay to your sel f , you 
know, something at the UN

now where  it 's di fferent  from being on 
the court. You someti
mes go very fast 
through a lot of mate
ri al  and you sa y, " Ge e , we  have
 140 countries, 80 countries 
fr om which we  ca n re cei ve re ports, i ndi vidu

, you s it on t his  
and what in-roads do you rea
lly make? But it's only a very
 -- I have that in very few 
mo ment s w h en t he  g o
ing gets  tough. 
Q: Do you e ver  have mome nts 
when you think, "I'm tired of 
this, I'm just tired of this. 
I've in a sense been looking at this kind 
of stuff my whole li
fe , since I was a little  
boy, and t hat  I woul d li ke  
to be  looki ng at  s hipping 
contrac ts or somet hingﬂ?  
A: Oh , yes . Act ually  I d o th
at some time s. Matter of fa ct, this year I was involved in a 
commer cial arbitrati on as an ar bitrat or. No
, you have to get a -- 
you can't -- first of 
all I 've ne ver  -- there are some pe opl e  who so
rt of live wit h t heir concentrat ion camp  
experience; i t 's beco me an ob
ses sion. I think I would go cr
az y i f I did. The one good  
thing, I 've a l wa ys been a ble 
to rel ax, wit h -- I don't need
 ver y muc h ti me . B ut i f I  
have these meetings and t hey 
go on for three weeks,
 if we can then ta
ke off for just a 
fe w days, I don't car ry it  with
 me. And this is survivor in
sti nc t . No, you have to get 
away. I get away 
fr om it in my writings, really, my
 academic writing
s. Even though 
I deal a lot wit h human right
s issues, but it 's ver y  academ
i c and it 's somet hing else. 
And I've tried to write at l
east one or t wo arti cles or a 
book a year so t hat keeps me  
obs ess ed in other  wa ys.

Q:  Ha ve you ever writ ten a b out your per son
al experi ence , whet he r it woul d be  for some  
sort of publi cation, or  e v en 
maybe perhaps for your fa mily? 
A: We ll, after my  bypass op
erati on in '93 I deci ded -- my 
kids have been pressing me  
for a long time -- I decided to
 begin writing. I've
 written about three or four chapters. 
But I've come to the conclusion that I n
eed -- I can't do it by myself. I'm much too 
much a lawyer when I  
write. It doesn't  -- I describe t h
ings r ather t ha n --  and I 've  
actuall y dis c usse d it wit h  somebody, that 
she mi ght work with 
me. Bec aus e what I 
write  sort of come s ou
t wooden i n ma ny wa
ys. And I don't  deal --  I 'm particul arly  
bad i n des cr i bing e moti o ns. But it 's obvio
us that one needs to write it down and 
things come  back that have
 long be en for gott en. I was str uc k by the fac t  that just 
sitting behind the computer and thinking of
 a certain event, a 
lot of things come 
bac k, na me s  come  bac k that I  t hought I 'd 
forgotte n a nd 50 ye ar
s later suddenly the 
na me of a ca mp comma n dant c o me s bac k to 
me , or the na me of a stre et. That 's the  
wonderful thing about doing that and I'll c
ont inue  doing that . The proble m is that 
academic books come in
 bet ween t hem, and t hen other  
assignments t hat
 sort of -- I  
have about t hree of four cha p
ters . And I di d write  actuall y i n Bet hany c oll ege , I di d 
write one story and th
ey had a publicat ion. 
Q:  Fiction or nonfiction? 

A: No, a st or y about the de ath marc h ac tually, 
that I reread i n order to give t he tal k at  
the Hol ocaust Museum on 
the Ausc hwitz --  on the 50th anniversa ry of t he

Hol ocaust , of t he deat h mar ch. And I had to 
sort  of go back in or der t o even r ecall  
some  things. No, it shoul
d be writt en down. I 've gi ven s o me i nt ervie ws . 
Q: You s aid, "I t 's obvious t h
at it shoul d be writt en down." 
You said that just a while 
ago. Then you just 
said, "It should be 
written down." Wh y? 
A: We ll, first of all, it should be sort of
 written down for the fa
mily. Wh at strikes me 
about this whole thing is that
 when my kids were little they
 had no interest at all. I 
mean, t hey sort of knew, and 
as they got older , 
they're now in their 
late 20s and earl y  
30s , the y now sa y, " Writ e it down." And th
ey would sa y, " We ll, why didn't you t ell  
me  tha t  be fore? "  You know, t h
is stor y or  that st or y. But at
 the ti me  real
ly when the y  
wer e young they had no intere st what soe ver, at le ast none that  I could per c eive . But  
now they really are very intere sted and they want  t o know 
this and that. So that's one 
reason. I t hi nk t he other reason i s that th
es e things shoul d not be
 forgotte n and those 
of us who have survived
 and who have the ability 
to recollect and express 
themselves about that have an
 obligation to put it 
down. It 's t h e kind of thi ng t hat i f  
nothing else, hopefully it will 
have an impact on the future
, at least in making people 
think a bout how you can pre v
ent those things. An d also, 
you know, this not ion about  
some of the  Holoc aust deni ers , her e  is an
 answer at least that
 this happened. The  
further away we get  from it, 
suppos edly, more  of t his de ni
al  is goi ng to come  a bout. 
Q: It seems that that's been a struggle fr om
 day one, that the Alli
ed forces act ually took 
Ger mans and showed them the camp s at a 
certai n poi nt. Have you
 ever in your own

personal experience come acr
oss s o meone who's  de nie d t hat it ha ppe ned, or the  
exte nt of it , a nd you've  
be en able  to s a y, 
"Hey just listen 
to this storyﬂ? 
A: No , I haven't. I've ofte
n thought that it would be wond
er ful i f  one of t he s e people  
would act ual l y call  me a  liar s o one c oul d ma
ybe bring a li bel suit 
to try to establish  
the truth of what actually 
happened. No , I've never had 
it . For many years  I thought  
it wasn't worthwhile  ta ki ng t hes e pe ople  
seri ous  and I t hought , you know, j ust a 
bunch of kooks . But it 's surp
rising how some of these pe
ople  have gai ned a certai n  
legitimacy and that's 
why it 's i mport ant to de al wit h it. Bec ause , of course, behi nd  
this Holocaust denial, 
it's not so much that
 the y a r e de nyi ng it  just for it 's own s ake  
but I think they'r e denying it in
 order to reestablish the ty
pe of political organizations 
that made this thing po
ssible in the first plac e. So it'
s part of the Ne ofascist, Ne onazi-
type  move ment, a nd i f you can
 deny that , t hat  it happened, t h en it  str engt hens your 
political mo vement and 
that's dangerous. 
Q:  Are you an 
Ameri can cit izen? 
A: Yes, I am. I became an Am
eri can cit i zen i n '57. As a 
matter of fact, it was -- I think  
I'm one of the fe w pe
ople who became an Am
erican citizen with 
the help of the FBI 
beca use I ha d won the nominat ion for the Rh
odes schola r shi p fr om West Vir ginia  
fr om Bethany and then fr om th
e state of West Virginia, a
nd I wasn't a citizen yet an d 
in order to compete in the fi nals I had to 
be a citizen. A 
lawyer in West Virginia who  
had be en an FBI a gent a nd who was also 
a for me r  Rhodes  sc holar  moved all ki nd s

of things to get me my citi
zenshi p, get me cl eared very fa
st so that I could get it. I 
had bee n i n the c ountry long e nough but 
i t  woul d ha ve t ake n much l onger. But I  
ma na ged t o get it and I ma na ged not  to get 
the Rhodes sc hol a r ship bec aus e I coul dn't  
expl ain in t h e fi nals why I wante d to go 
to England when I had just gotten to the 
Uni t ed State s, whic h wa s  ver y di ffic ul
t to explai n, and I r eall y was l ost. 
Q:  The y as ked t hat spe ci fic  que stion?  
A: They asked me a lot of ot
her things and all of that se
emed to be goi
ng well until they 
said, " Well , you've just b
ecome a US citizen, why do yo
u want to go to England? "  
And I re ally didn't  ha ve  a  go
od a ns we r  and so I t hi nk th
at  was  one  of the r e asons. 
Q: After you beca me a citi zen, what was 
it like for  you -- and this would have be en  
more rece ntl y, whe n ther e were very openNa zi rallies in thi s  countr y?  What were 

your thoughts about it?  
A: We ll, I reall y think that t he reacti on t o 
the Nazi rallies her e have been wrong ones. I  
think that one shoul d 
let the people march,
 one  s hould do what
 the Norwegians did  
wh en I wa s in Oslo . At one 
poi nt, when t he y ha d a Na zi de monstr ation, t he pe ople  
all came out led by the bishop of Oslo and 
when the marchers wa
lked by, all of the  
people in the street turned th
eir backs to them in silent de
monstration, which to me is  
the wa y the y shoul d be  handle d. I f  you star
t fi ghts and everythi
ng, t ha t 's e xactl y  
what they want. And first of all, I thi
nk in this country we have e n ough ot her  
mechanisms  to deal with it that we don't 
need to prohibit thos

Q: I realize d you menti one d your sons a nd 
we shoul d just cla ri fy a little bit about your  
fa mi ly. M aybe you can j ust
 t ell us  who's i n your  
family, how ma ny people. 
A: I have thre e sons, a ste pdaughter a nd 
a stepson, a n d the y 'r e all over t he wor l d now. 
I 'm marrie d and it 's my s econd marr ia ge. M y 
wife is originally fr

the same sort of mixture th
at I am. She's a Peruvian, It

met in Costa Rica. My ol dest son is 
in Poland right no
w working for t he 
Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, and he
 will actually be dealing  
with the elections in Bosnia 
for t he agency. So t h at, I th
ought it was interesting that 
at least one of us in the fa

here in Wa shington, lives in

Mi a mi a nd my st eps on li ves  in Costa Ri ca.  
We  have four gra ndchil dr en

Q:  The son who is
 i n Pola nd, does  he  s pe ak Polish?  
A: No, unfort u natel y not, I think he r egr

unfortunatel y, ha ve prett y muc h forgotten mu

he just got there.  
He i s a la wyer by trai ni ng but he worke d for AID

Q:  Whic h la nguages  do you spea k now?  
A: We ll I spea k Englis h a nd Ger ma n. I can get al ong i n Polis h and I s pea k Spani sh  
quite  well , r eally, beca us e I ha d t o work 
in Spanish. But I learned Spanish when I 
fir st was elected t o the court 
and I learned it by, not formally
, I learned it by listening 
to the interpretation with one ear and to the or
iginal in the other. In the process I lost  
both my Italian 
and my French. I can s
till get along in French. 
Q: Go back to when 
your sons were
 little, when they were about
 five or si
x or seven, 
ma ybe eight . What wer e  your t houghts?  
Woul d you l ook at the m, t hey wer e little 
boys li ke you were , di d it sur p
rise  you the things they 
did, did it ma ke you think 
about what you wer e like, an
d how much -- pr obabl y the y wer e too young t hen but 
as they got older, how much
 did you tell them about what
 had happe ned to you, an d 
have you t o ld the m e ve r ythi ng?  Or  doe
s a per son who's  hear d the Holoc aust  
Muse um video ta pe, do they per haps know
 a fe w more details
 about what you  
experienced in t he camps than
 t he y do, at  thi s poi nt ? 
A: I think if you saw th
e  Holoc aus t vide o ta pe , they mi ght know more  than my 
childr en. Alt hough my c hildre n mi ght know 
a l ot of ot her det a ils
 that they wouldn't 
know. Did I tell them? 
I suppose on different occasi
ons, different little snippets,

particularly when my mother used to 
come  and visit we woul d re mi nis ce. But  
probabl y not  as much e i t her a s I c oul d ha ve
 or a s I shoul d ha ve but  at the s a me ti me  
you re ally a s  a parent , you know, you can't  just tr y to drum t h ings i nto ki ds™ hea ds 
and i f  they don't wa nt t o as k, t her e 's nothi ng much
 to tell. I think 
their interest is  
gradual , has really c o me more rece nt. 
But maybe , you know, I never know, beca use  
it ma y well be that they were
 a frai d to as k, t hat t hey t hought it woul d be painful,  
although it never has been because in our family we always talked about these  
things. But  ma ybe t hey didn't  wa
nt  t o ask for a variety of 
rea sons. They c ertainl y, I 
don't  thi nk, can reall y i magin
e what  it was and t hey never  
really asked that kind of 
thing. There  wa s s o met h ing else
 you asked me  t hat I 've  for g otten, t he fir st part . It  
will  come back.  
Q:  For instance, ha
ve you ever --  
A: Oh, ye s, I re me mber wha t
 you a ske d me , about when I lo
oked at my c hil dr en, how I  
wo uld react. Well, you know, 
every so often when children 
were sort of
 my  a g e,  I  
would l ook at the m a nd I woul
d t hink, could they s urvi ve this?  You know, t his is the  
age and look, t hey are such children and 
this was the age that
 I was when t his  
happe ned. Then you s o me how 
think, ye s, they could ha
ve. Wh en you see street  
children in Latin America, 
how stre et-s mart  the y are  a nd how they sur vive , yo u 
realize  ki ds have that 
in them. I've se en this
 in Brazil, I've seen 
it in other places, in 
Guatemal a. These ki ds have th
at survival instinct. But when
 you look at s or t  of, our

childr en you say, ﬁ No, they could never ma ke 
it.ﬂ But the fact is 
they c oul d. There 's  
tremendous resilience that 
children have, some childre
n. Some children may be  
more se nsiti ve tha n othe rs but I think child
ren ar e blessed wi th this resili ence that  
enables them to surv
i ve better t ha n gr own- ups  ca n sur vive i n many sit uati ons. 
Q: Obviousl y you l ost your
 childhood in ma ny ways . Is it 
s o methi ng you got back lat er  
on? An example wo uld be, when
 you're that young 
you still wa nt to be held a lot. 
Did anybody ever hol d you wh
en you were a little boy in 
the camps or is that  
somet hing you just  l ost?  
A: No, nobody held me
 except my mot h er and fat her . Bu
t it's interestin
g, whe n I ca me 
bac k whe n I found my mother
, I thi nk the first year I just s t uck t o her as i f, you  
know, I ki ss ed her all the  ti me . It was sort
 of all comi ng bac k. Bu
t of course I mi sse d 
a lot. At the same ti
me , you know, it 's  sort of curi ous but I think -- I did eight year s  
of school i n  one ye ar of private t utoring a nd it t urns out I have dysle xia  whic h I  
never reali ze d I ha d. One of my c hildr en ha
s that proble m and he suffere d quite a lot  
because it appeared i n fir st 
gr ade and second gr ade; it wa
s a problem.  I didn't know I  
had it until he was tested and 
the doctor tested me and it 
turned out that my case was 
just as serious a s his but bec ause I starte
d so much later, I just learned how t o  
compensate for it. So there are a lot of thin
gs that, there wer e  al
so be ne fit s. Just to 
think of all the eight years of school one 
could have skippe d wi thout suppos edly a ny 
great l oss of learni ng. Al though I ha ve alwa
ys kidded by t he fact that I never reall y

learned the alphabet properly
. I never learned the ABC an
d stuff, all of these little  
things that  you lear ned i n  gr
a de  sc hool I ne
ver learned.  
Q:  No, you j ust  have a  doct orate degr
ee in international 
law from Harvard. 
A: Ye s. It shows you that it 's 
not t hat di ffic ult , that  it must 
be that all you have to do is 
just ski p enough cl asses. 
Q: It is a mazi ng, a nd I thought this a b
out a n hour  and hal f
 a go, how mu ch we 'r e 
laughing i n t his dis cus sion. 
A: We ll, this is what I try to tell you, th
at those of us who we nt through it all went  
through it because we we
re lucky in everything
 else. But also in a 
sense, and I'm still  
able to tal k  about it today, is bec a
use we we ren't j ust weighed down by the  
terribleness of it, that we didn't let it aff
ect our whole li fe. One 
ha s to be abl e to 
laugh about  t hings, get r a ving 
ma d. And some  t hings
 are funny, some  
t hings  are  sa d.  
Q: Some  st udi e s ha ve bee n
 done on children of Holoca
ust sur vi vors  and some  ha ve  
chara cteri sti cs, a nd one is de pres sion, is 
that somet hing t hat  has occ urre d in your  
fa mi ly and do you see 
a li nk ther e 
if it has? 
A: Fort unatel y, not at al l, no
. It ma y be  because I  ha ve ne ver  be en ver y i ntrospective  s o  
it hasn't affected my
 chi ldren. No, not at all. Th
ey areŠno, I don't think it has 
affected t hem at all , at least not i n any ne
gati ve way t hat I can 
think of. M a ybe i f the 
Hol oc aust s urvi vor™ s husba nd a nd wife -- 
t hat might be. But, you know, my wi fe

ma y ma ke a di ffere nce , a lthough I 'm not e v
e n s ur e. I t hink it depe nds on the fa mily , 
it depends on the a
ttitude of people.  
Q: Wh at about religion? Wh
en you brought your
 children up, not just religi o n, Je wi sh  
cultur e -- how did you c onvey 
that to them as they were
 growing up?  Did you mak e  
sort of a spe cific e ffort
 to do t hat
 and how so?  
A: We ll, I wanted the children to grow up 
Je wish a n d so the y we nt to Sunday School , 
they wer e Bar Mitzvahe d, a nd 
all of this. But they were 
not in a Jewish home in a 
sens e t hat I ' m not  reli gious at  all . I t h ink 
my chil dren are more 
religious, at least two 
of my  sons often drag me to
 a temple on the Hi
gh Holi da ys a nd chi de me  if I don't  
go. I t hink what I try to do which i s s ort of nat ural , that I try t o  bring t he m up in t he  
Je wish sense  fr om a cult ural poi nt of vie w, 
t hat they shoul d ha ve his t oric al sens e of 
wh at J uda is m me an s a n
d the contribution of Judaism to
 cult ure. And 
they shouldn't 
be ashamed of it, that it
's somet hing li ke any othe
r  cultur e, to be  pr oud of. 
Q:  Where  di d you rais e t he m pri ma r ily?  
A: First in Buff alo. I live d i n, I taught , exce pt
 for the first year I taught one year at the 
University of Pennsylvania 
law school and then I taught 
for 13 yea r s i n Buffalo at  
the Stat e Universit y of New Yor k. And t hen 
I taught at the Univer
sity of Texas, in 
Austin. The n I ca me to Wa shi ngt on, I wa
s dean at the American Uni ver sity Law  
School. Th en I left  Wa shington and worked
 with President Cart er at the Carter 
Ce nter  and t aught at Emory, t he Em

Q: Ho w often do you think ab
out being in the ca mps? Is th
at something that happens a 
lot? 
A: No, not  reall y. It  ha ppens  onl y i f  ther e  
wa s s o me r eason t hat woul d bri ng it  out . Not 
very much at all, only
 if there is some sort
 of specific event th
at triggers something, 
but  ot her wis e I don't  t hink a bout it  at  all. 
Q: Are there sounds that will really bring it 
out, or something that 
will just bring back a 
memory? We tal ked earli er about t he smell 
of bre a d. What a bout 
sounds or smells? 
A: Not really, mo re events. Y
ou know i f you re ad a bout or  
if you se e, for example, if 
you see t he people behi nd the bar bed wire i n
 Bos nia, t hat brings it back, t h ose t ype s  
of things. But not anymore.
 Ma ybe  some t hings you re
a d a b out and s o me Ger ma n  
words or s o met hing, tha t  mi
ght t r igger s o met hi ng. But re al ly pr obabl y  there be  
mont hs wi ll go by t hat I  don't
 think about it at
 all, it doesn't co
me  back at  a ll. 
Q:  What  about  being 
on a  tr ain, just goi ng on a r e
gular American 
Amtrack train? 
A: You know, I haven't be en on a n Ameri c
an Amtrack tr ain f or a 
long time but I've 
bee n on tr ai ns i n Eur ope. No, i t  doesn't
, you know the trains
 are so comfortable 
compared t o  the train I  was 
on, the trains I wa s on. No
 that doesn't. It does 
sometimes when I 
see one of those railroad cars, thos
e sort of open cattle cars, that 
brings bac k fla shbac ks . Or I  might e ven 
say, you know, "This 
looks almost like the 
car I was in." But no
, not as much as 
one wo uld think.

A: Alt hough you know, let me tell you s o meth
i ng t h at strike s me . I think I me ntioned it  
be for e. I a m  mu ch more  sensit ive t o some 
of the s e issues a s I  get ol der a n d I don't 
know why t hat is , it bot hers me  
in a sense because I 've been
 able t o sort of -- I've 
always pr ide d mysel f of being able t o just 
put it out of my mind. 
In the sort of last  
ten years its, I fi nd it hard
er  to do and I don't  know
 why that is. Yo u know, 
sometimes people when th
e y get very old t h ey su
ddenl y  only re me mber the 
language they spoke when th
ey were little. I don't know what
 it is but it's strange, I 
so meti me s feel I ' m goi ng  so ft  
beca use  I 've bee n able just 
t o put  things ver y much out  
of my mind all my life . I fi
nd I'm much more sensitive no
w. Certain things bother 
me  more you know. 
Q:  Such as? 

A: No, I fi nd t he death of my
 mot her affected me tremen
dousl y and si nce then, I 've  
found that things relating to 
the camp are much har der for 
me to take than they were 
be for e. I haven't bee n abl e yet, I 've be en 
thi nki ng a  lot about why 
that shoul d be t h a t  
this connection, 
but it's there. 
It's had quite an impact 
on me in terms of those 
me morie s. Not onl y, obvi ousl y a
nyone who's mo ther dies is
 affected by it but it's  
affected me in terms of th
e past , much more t h an I wo
uld have thought. Or it 's  
simply old age,
 I don't know. 
Q:  Wh en did your mo ther die? 
A:  In '9 3, no I'm sorry, '9 2.

Q: That 's wh at I want ed to
 ask you. Are there some things you'd like t o say tha t  I  
haven't touched on? 
A: No, you've bee n ver y good i n getti ng mo
re out  of me tha n  usua l, no. J ust thi nk
