then, I grew up like every ch

Q: Were you the youngest?  
A: I was the youngest. I had friends, I was 
going to school, I was going to Hebrew 
school. Never have time too mu ch to be 
outside like running ar
ound or whatever,

 that we should get whatev

Q: Was he himself educated?

Q: I wanted to know where is 
Rozwadow

Galicia
 belonged to 
Austria

Œ

Q: What was life like at home? Was it Œ

the boys to be very 
religious and have a 
good education, as far as he 
could afforded to pay for it. 
Q: And your mother, what was she Œ 

A: My moth er was 
[indecipherable]
 she raised the childre
n, she made whatever 
she could clothes. She was sewing clothes 
for myself, not for my brothers, just for 
me. She had a sister-in -law, which was a 
terrific dressmaker, so
 she used to cut 
material, an d my mother used to sew it.
 So I always had nice clothes to go to 
school, or to go to friends, or as you coul
d see from the picture, I was dressed like a 
middle class person, like a middle class child actually. 

Q: Was a middle class child in 
Poland

the 
United States

A: The town  Œ we had Œ the 
town was not big, but it wa
s a 90 percent Jewish town, 
with a lot of youth. We had our own 
Bürg ermeister
, which means the mayor was a 
Jew, a very rich Jew. And we had a city 
hall, we had a jail. No hospitals, we had 
docto rs, we had pharmacists, and of
 course a lot of merchants. 
Q: So, it was a large Jewish community. 
A: A large Jewish community, yes. 

Q: Within a small town, would that Œ or was it a city? 
A: Well, the town was not big, but yo
u cannot consider a very small town . 
Q: Okay . 

A: We had three shuls. 
Q: Okay . 
A: In the three, we had a Œ the very Or
thodox shul; we had the Conservative, more 
or less, shul; and we had Œ and the rabbis,

were four rabbis in our town. There were
 two brothers, and they had their own

A: Well, mostly like fam
ilies know Œ knew each other, 
because the families stu ck 
together, like my mother™s fa
mily was quite a large family
, and my father™s family 
was quite a large family. I mean
, they were not so large, 
like there were six, and in 
my mother™s family there were six. And 
they  all had children there Œ not married, 
they were still all young before the war. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I mean, married age came during the war. 
Q: That™s right.  
A: But before the war they 
were still all like 16 - 15 - 
14 years old. So mostly Œ 
especially you Œ you 
knew very much your neighbors,
 because we were like close 
knit and living very close to each other. So  Œ 

Q: Which parent were you closer to? 

A: Which grandparents? 

Q: Parent. Parent. Your mother or your
 father, who did you feel closer to? 
A: I think there were times when I was ve
ry close with my mo

father didn™t have time for anything, 
cause he was always, always working Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ in order to provide fo r the family. And then Œ well,
 this was before the war.

Q: Uh-huh, okay. I-Is that 
it changed during the war? 
A: I-It Œ it changed Œ in 1938 my fath
er was drafted to the Polish army. 
Q: Yes. 

A: And everybody was very stunned becaus
e already he Œ that time he was in the 
40s, and he was like the only Jew who was 
drafted to the Polish army , and nobody 
could understand why. So of course it was 
very hard for my mo
ther with the three 
of us to make a living, or support us. We
 went to my grandfather, to my father™s 
father. He had a big house, he
 had room for us, and he told
 us to come there. S o  we 
lived together until the war. 
Q: I see. 
A: And we didn™t hear from 
my father if he™s alive or
 not, where he is. He was 
fighting. Wh en the war started, he had to
 fight with the Polish army, the Germans. 
Q: That was Œ mu st have been very  frighten ing. 
A: It was very frightening and when they 
start to bomb the city, we all escaped like 
to a village, not far from 
Rozwadow
, and then  we came back. And we never went 
home again. And my mother 
stayed with us, w
ith my  grandfather, my  grandmother 
had died just before, a few years. We stay
ed, and also my  aunt and uncle. And their

children all stayed at the same 
house until the Germans march into 
Poland
, to our 
city. 
Q: I want to stop th ere. I still want to talk a little bit about pre-war. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you have an earliest memo ry? 

A: Excuse me? 

Q: Do you have an earliest memo ry? Do 
you have, you know, as a child growing 
up, one of your Œ th e earliest th
ings that Œ that you can rememb er? 
A: I could Œ I could remember th at anti-
Semitism started. I felt Œ not only I, the 
whole family, that short before the war, the 
antemitism
(ph) got much mo re Œ 
Q: Strong? 

A: Œ intensiv e, you know, and it was scary to
 go out, especially at night, especially 
before a Christmas holiday, my father neve
r let us out in the street, because the 

Polish people, they are very
, very  susceptible to drinking. And whoever they saw 
they could have beat up or something, 
and it was scary to go out. So this I 
remember very well when I got older a little
 bit, not when I wa
s very young. When 
I was very young, I was like very free to 
roam around, not the city, but near the 
house. We had the little park, you know, we
 had swings. So it wasn™t like I had to

go far away that™s my mother couldn™t call me
 in when she felt it™s time to get into 
the house. So Œ 
Q: So Œ 
A: Œ I was Œ I was a happy child. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And had very good friends. 

Q: Can we stop for a minute? I™d Œ 
[break] 
A: So Œ 

Q: You were talking about some ve
ry close friends that you had. 

A: Yeah, I had friends, we Œ we were ve
ry happy, you know. I remember I had a 
friend, she was rich, and they had the te
lephone in the house, and also a doll Œ a 
doll and a carriage. We all got together 
and play with her 
dolls and with the 
carriage. It was like, even for a person w
ho didn™t make a living for the family, but 
you couldn™t afforded those th
ings. So if somebody was able
 to afford it, well, they 
had the beer factory, that friend of
 mine. She didn™t survive the war. 
Q: What was her name? 

A: Excuse me? 
Q: What was her name?

longer she will survive. I sp

d we were close, we went 
always together, skating, to school, to Œ 
to public school, to Hebrew  school. We 
were like three of us always, always toge

we got to the other side. On the other side we had a small village, but it was

So instead of keeping the pr

took over. All the people who registeredto go home, they got them together from

 was on a Friday night, I remember like 
now. My  mo ther had co oked  something fo r Sh abbas. The Russians came in,

I was the youngest of

Ralph Herzog
 was the chief rabbi of 
Palestine
. He came 
to 
Poland
 and gathered 600 young children, a

certificates to be able to bring to 
Isr a e l

rabbi, later on, of 
Israel

Israel 
later Œ later

Israel 
was established. And he to ok 600 children from the 
Mizrachi

 and

Czechoslovakia
. Supposedly in 
Czechoslovakia
, he is supposed to  get the 
certificates for the 
kids to go in to 
Palestine
, that time 
Palestine

This was 1946. 
But certificates never came. We came to

 which is now part of Œ 
not part of 
Czechoslovakia
, and we stayed there over Sh abbas because he didn™t 
travel Shabbas. The people there brought 
us food. They  divided us in different 
hotels. We stayed over Shabbas, Sh abbas night we went to 
Prague
. In 
Prague
 
there was a camp for the child

Prague
, which was 
called 
Jablitz
(ph). 
Q: 
Jablitz

 that time, to request why he didn™t get 
the promised cer Œ 

Q: Certificates. 
A: Œ you know, affidavits or certificat

They left us in 
Jablitz

Aliyah [indeciphera ble] 
took over,
 
another 
Jewish organization, and th en divided 
us into two groups, which were the 
Mizr achi
 
and 
Aguda

Czechoslovakia

Strasbourg
 in

Ma d ra f eme

stayed in

from 1946 to 1948.

 because they had family

he registered for 
America
. He didn™t have any papers. Because we were on th e 
American zone, they had to let you go 
wh ere you wanted, because supposedly you

e here, we got the green card right away, 
and the minute we got off the bus Œ the 
ship Œ the ship was 
coming here was like 
half dead. We came here on military ships.
 I remember the name of the ship was 
General 
Blatchford

1950, in December Œ 1950, just
 a day before Christmas.

Q: I have a couple of questions still. 
A: All right. No problem. 

Q: When it all started, when all of this 
started, so unexpectedly
 for you, you were 
nine years old. 

A: Close to 10. 

Q: Close to 10. And wh en the war ende
d, you were already 15 - 16 years? 
A: 16, yeah. 
Q: How did you chan ge, what happened ? Were you the same person? 
A: I grew up too fast. I didn™t have teenag
e years, so I didn™t kn
ow what it means to 
be young, because between ™39 and ™45, 
it was like a period yo
u didn™t know where 
it went. Was very hard times, especially th
e winter times. When 
you were healthy, 
then it was like you appreciated that because you were healthy. In the teenage 

years, when  you were the teenage years, 
you always had to do something to help 
the family, you know. So I learned in 
France
 how to sew, when I got married. We 
didn™t have anything, I just went to wo rk
 right away. I was sewing clothes. We had 
the little factory in the camp
. And then, because I knew 
a little Hebrew, and I was a 
little bit ed ucated, I was work
ing in the kinderg
arten with kids, and for a while, 
until we emigrated to 
America
.

we were the lucky ones, we
 weren™t shot to death.
