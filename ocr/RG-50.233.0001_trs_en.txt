Interview with Miru Alca na 
        August 30, 1992 

   Los Angeles, California 

 

 

Q: Okay let™s begin by -- if you can tell me  your na me . 

 

A: Yes.  My name  is Miru Alcana.  I wa
s born in the island of Rhodes in 1915 and I 
was deported in 1944, July 23, 1944.  From Rhodes, we spent three days in one 

building and after they took us to different 
couple of boats to take us to Pireo and 
from Pireo we went to Athens.  In At
hens was a camp of c oncentration and the 
name was Haidari.  We s pent over there 
three days in Haidar
i and three of our 
fa mily, relative, they pass away because 
was thirsty and they couldn™t survive.  
The name  of this people who pass away
 was Moselton Hasson, is cousin of my 
mother.  Also Allegra Buroff and her mother.  I don™t reme mber her name .  After 

three days we was in Athens, in Haidari,
 they put us in wagon like animals with 
no water, no food.  Only they put some  br
ead, very, very hard.  They put boxes of 
little onion, white onions.  Also boxes of
 honey and also some thing else.  We  
couldn™t eat because the bread was very ha
rd, we can™t chew and besides that no 
water; how can we eat the 
honey?   How can we  eat th
e onions without water?   
How we would dump the bread with no water?
  So we arrive in Auschwitz after 
three weeks, traveli
ng through the night.  Daytime we
 was hiding different places 
but we didn™t know where it was.  Finally 
we arrive in Auschwitz but during the 
trip, three men, they pass away in Serb
ia.  One was Rahami m Galanti, another 
Alchadef, Yomt ov and the other was Yehuda
 Notrica.  Those three me ns, they 
died because  they was thirsty.  Without wa
ter, they couldn™t survive.  Finally we 
arrive Auschwitz.   In Auschwitz, they sepa
rated from our parents.  They told us 
we would see every ni ght but you young people, you will go to work.  Then every 

night, you will meet your parents.  So -- wa
s not like that.  The only thing, when 
we arrive, they choose us for work and they
 put us in line.  In the meantime, we 
was hungry and thirsty and finally we  smelle
d the meat.  Smelled the meat and we 

said I hope those SS they should choke 
because they having barbecue,  They 
having broiled steak with 
music but we didn™t know 
what was going on.  The only 
thing the other people, the French people w
ho was in line with us, they said, when 
did you arrive?   We  say a few hours ago.  So
 there are your parents, are cremated.  
Cremated, what mean?   We don™t know that
 word, cremated.  In our country, we 

never heard that.  They say those people 
who doesn™t -- that are not too strong to 
work, they put in the ovens.  You can imagin
e how we feel to hear that.  To smell 
they are burning our parents with the music.
  Because not to hear the screaming.  
We start to cry, screaming, nothing we can 
do. After they start to count and they 
send us to take shower.  After they pu
t in our block, in every -- number 20 the 
first time .  Four o™clock or 
before, they start to call ﬁsel appel, sel appelﬂ  That 

means they have to count.  That is the story of Auschwitz 
and our life.  I don™t 
know what to say else.  The only thing when we was working, they choose us to 

work in the factory.  I wa s working in
 gleeov but I don™t know how to explain 
what means gleeov.  The only thing was big 
trunk to put pieces
 of material to 

 
 
2
make machi ne gun; to some electricity to 
ma ke very, very hard.  Just like in one 
little room where there are 500 
kilowatts for twenty mi nutes.  Then after, we have 
to take out and bring to the other girls to 
work.  Then put the other box over there.  
That was all the work in Auschwitz.  In 
the meantime, we didn™t have nothing.  
On Sunday, ﬁkein arbeit kein
 brotﬂ.  They don™t give 
us anything to eat.  But 
every 12 hours, we was working.  They us
ed to give a little soup and one tiny 
piece of bread.  We  have to keep for the next day to work.  In the meantime, there 

was people who they steal your bread 
and nothing you can talk because we 
couldn™t talk German and we can™t defend 
ourselves in Yiddish.  Really, we have 
very, very hard life.  That 
is the history of our life. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  what you reme mber about
 when the war first broke out?   Do you 
have any recollections about wh
at was happening at that time? 
 

A: When I was working? 

 

Q: Yeah, what were you doing then when 
you first heard that the war had broken 
out?  
 

A: In Auschwitz I used to go to bring bric
ks or Œ in Auschwitz also the barracks, the 
food for us.  But in Auschwitz we have bitt
er experience.  We  used to accept three 
slice of tiny bread to buy a panty, a brief,
 a panty.  When we washed and we was 
waiting for a little bit sun.  Sun, we never 
saw in Auschwitz and we tried to put -- 
to be in the air.  The Polish, the grabbe
d the panty and they go to the blockkova to 
say, look the Italian, they stole my panty.  
Wa s not true, we can™t talk and then the 
blockkova came .  They punish us and they 
beat us without no reason because we 
didn™t know the language.  We  didn™t know
 Yiddish and we suffered worst than 
the Hitler.  In Germany when I was in Bu
chenwald, working in the factory, I used 

to help the ot her gi rls.  Because they 
couldn™t do their own job so when I have 20 
mi nutes to rest until the trunk was in the ove
n; so I used to help some  girls to do 
their own job.  I tried to save the gi rls.  Ot
herwise, they will be killed, they will be 

cremated.  So thank God, they are alive. When I was liberated in Theresienstadt I 

went to Prague.  From Pr ague, I took the 
train.  I went to B
udapest to look for 
medicines for the gi rls because they have 
dysentery.  They ga ve me  but before I 
had problem with -- in the office because 
they don™t want to give me  anything.  
They say bring your sist er here and we will 
help.  I say they ar
e in the hospital.  
The Russian, they don™t have nothing to he
lp them. I saved them and I want to 
take home back with me .  I spoke with the ma nager and I say, listen, I came  from 

Prague.  I spent three nights and two days
 and a half in the trains.  Now I need 
help from you.  I want to save my sister. 
 I say here is my name s.  My na me  is 
Miru Alcana and they say, what is this.  D
eanna Galanti, the other.  I say they are 
my sister, my father passed away, my  mo
ther got ma rried.  So they are Galanti, 
the other sister, half
-sisters.  Finally they gave me
 me dicine and also gave me  
1,200 me rango (130) for each one.  I came back
 to Prague, not to Prague .  I find 
they was in Rattot.  I came  back.  I l
ooked where the Rattot to see where is the 
camp to me e t  them again.  Finally I ha
ve hard time.  I don™t know how many 

 
 
3
kilometers I walk and fi nally we was t
ogether until we came back to Bologna, 
Italy altogether.  I accomplished some thing 
in my life.  They recognized what I 
did for them and we are in touch with them.  They call me  often, one, she live in 

Vancouver, Washington.  The 
other live in Miami.  Th
e other live between -- the 
other si ster she live be tween Switzerland and France.  But when they come  to see 

the sist er, we meet each other.  Wh
at else?  Another 
girl, she live in 
Johannesburg. She write me  and once  in a 
while, she send something, present. At 
least they recognize what I di
d for them.  I™ m satisfied, not what they send me  but 

at least they recognize and they
 never forget of me.  That is all my life.  Maybe I 
got some thing else but right now I don™treme mber.  Don™t forget, I™m old lady. 
 

             

 

Q: Let™s go back now to before you went to Auschwitz. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: At the very beginning of the war.  Y
ou can tell me what you reme mber about that 
time and what you were doing at that time? 
 

A: In that time, I was at the hospital stud
y to be mi dwife but I couldn™t because with 
the situation of the Jews.  They were not
 allowed to continue to study so I was 
nurse.  Nurse, I used to do shots for so 
ma ny people and I used to do tests of the 
urine for diabetes and albumi n.  Also I 
had store one of the best of Rhodes.  
Perfumeria Rosa di Rodi they used to ca
ll.  Wa s a store of classic perfume.  For 
ma ny years, I was very pleased to ma nage 
that  stor e  But until the Germans -- fi rst 
of all, when I was -- before that I 
was working with the governme nt, the manu 
foreste.  But I couldn™t work over there, th
ey say, because I was Jewish so I lost  
the job.  After I went to work in that 
store where they sell 
the perfumery.  From 
there I used to go to the hospital to finish
 the course.  In the meanti me , I used to 
ma ke good money for the shots I used to give 
to people.  Also with --.  I used to 
ma ke good money.  One of the best worker  or salelady or employee you can tell 

was myself because I used to ma ke 
good, good, good money.  After we start with 
the problem of the Germans so until we fini
sh to be in the hands of the Nazis.  
Now when I  hear still the Nazis is gr
owing up, really I™m getting nervous.  I™m 
sick.  But nothing you can do.  People, th
ey are cruel, people they don™t know 
what they want.  It is just
 that they are envy and mean. 
 

Q: Sharon told me  that before the war,
 you were involved in Ort, O-R-T? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: I wrote down O-R-T.  ORT.  Is that -- 
she said before the war, can you talk about 
that? 
 

A: I don™t reme mber what you --.  Let me  see. 

 
 
4
 
Q: Can you talk about that a 
little bit, into the tape? 

 

A: I hope she will change something.  She will not copy everythi ng. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: Huh? 

 

Q: Yes.  They™ll summarize. 

 

A: Because so ma ny things --. 

 

Q: It™sokay. 

 

A: After -- did you open?   After I came b
ack from c oncentration camp, I used to 
work.  I used to be in the Jewish 
community in Bologna, Via Gombruti Nove, 
nine.  I used to help all those girls to 
cook and to be together because I thought it 
was my duty to help them because they wa
s orphans, no parents.  But I was also 
without parents but I 
tried to help them.  In the 
meantime, I used to go to the 
hospital to see the people 
who came back from c oncentration camp was in very 
bad shape.  I used to bring some thing to
 them every single day.  I used to go to 

Instituto Rizzoli and also to Santa Orsola
di to hospital to help them.  In the 
meanti me , we used to have La Wi zo like 
Hadassah over here, Wi
zo.  We used to -
- I was very active,  I was me mber and I used
 to ma ke cookies to have tea, to give 
tea and then to ma ke mo ney to send to Er
etz Israel.  Because Israel -- I was very 
Zionist in my country because my brot
her was president of the Macabee.  My 
grandparents -- my grandfather died in Je
rusalem;  my grandmother, also.  They 

were very, very Zionist.  Also I continue
d to be Zi onist and I was revisionist in 
my country in Rhodes.  So when I was af
ter the concentration camp, I used to be 
running from one place to the ot her to bri
ng cassette, how do you say it?  I used to 
go from one  house to the other to bring the keren ami box, the blue box to receive 

some, to get some money to send to Er etz 
Israel.  Also in this country, I do the 
same  thing.  Twice yearly, I have to bri
ng the cassette, the bo
xes of -- the blue 
box to the Jewish Fund for Israel.  I think 
for today, I don™t have else what to say.  
Maybe --. 
 

Q: Okay, let™s talk a little bit about what 
it was like to grow up in Rhodes.  When you 
were a child --? 
 

A: InRhodes? 

 

Q: Yeah, can you tell me  like about --
 like the neighborhood where you lived and 
what life was like there? 
 

 
 
5
A: The life in Rhodes was beautiful, beautiful. 
 We had wonderful lif
e.  First of all, 
we went to school.  Our pare
nts they was very religious
 and they was --.  They 
gave lots of advice.  They teach us how to be human being, to be generous, to be 
unselfish.  At the school, I used to do 
good work and after the school I used to 
work.  After the school, I used to work.  
After I finish the school, I went to the 
hospital to learn mi dwife but unfortunately, 
like I will repeat, I didn™t have luck to 
finish because on account of the religion -- of
 the Nazis.  From there I st ar ted to 
work, to ma ke living, to help our parents. 
 

Q: Can you talk about whatit was like at the school? 

 

A: The school -- we used to have --.  This
 school was Jewish school.  We  have  part 
Italian, they have teachers in Italian, 
teacher in Hebrew and also teacher in 
French.  But most important, the more clas
ses we had, was Italian subject.  Then 
French, and after Hebrew.  Hebrew we ha
ve three times weekly for one hour.  In 
fact when I go to Israel, I have no pr
oblem with my language because when I 
studied the dikduk in Hebrew, the only thi
ng I learned with point.  I didn™t learn 

without.  But they teach us for little is
land of Rhodes, no ma tter how ma ny they 

used to before teach the boys.  The boys th
ey used to send to the chabra or to 
college , Hebrew college, but the gi rls, they
 were not allowed.  Only the boys they 
should.  But later they start to teach us, 
the girls, three hours weekly.  Wa s not so 
bad.  At least we learned some thing.  Th
e most important what we learned, to 
respect the pe ople, to respect our pa re
nts and to know the Ten Commandments, 
what is very, very important. At the school
, they used to teach us Hebrew history 
and so we continue to keep that in ou
r mi nd.  No ma tter what we went through in 
our life, still we keep what we learn fr
om our parents and from the school.  That 
was wonderful experience in our life. 
 

Q: Okay.  As a child growing up, also, can 
you talk about what ot
her sorts of things 
you did?   Like did you learn any mu
sic or did you have any hobbies? 
 

A: Not hobbies, no hobbies.  The only thing is 
to study and to be
 --to work in the 
house, to help the parents.  To my mo ther, 
to help in the family, in the house.  But 
no hobby, only we had gymnastic, we have 
exercise with the school, you know, 
like boy scout.  That is all, we didn™t ha
ve too mu ch like over here.  We  was more 
conservative.  We  didn™t have too mu ch liberty, no. 
 

Q: Can you describe what the nei
ghborhood was like, what it looked like? 
 

A: Oh, wonderful neighborhood we have.  Ev
eryone very friendly like one family.  
No ma tter how ma ny ne ighbors we have, everyone
 is just like fa mily..  In fact, we 

used to say Auntie Rosa, Auntie Straya
, Auntie Re becca, but we didn™t know if 
they were relative or not.  Because ou
r parent s they say, say hello to Auntie 
Rebecca or sa y hello to Auntie Rifka.  To 
everyone we have to say Auntie.  So for 
us all the neighbors was family. 
 

 
 
6
Q: So the neighborhood was all Jewish then, right? 
 

A: Yes, everyone.  We  didn™t have no strangers. 

 

Q: Okay.  Can you talk about your brothers and your sister some ? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: Can you talk about your 
brothers and your sister? 
 

A: My brother was good, good shoema ke
r.  He ma ke boots, boots. 

 

Q: Which brother are we --? 

 

A: Josef, Josef.  He -- very expensive.  Al so Nissim was mechanic.  He used to work 
with engineer, Lanarie.  Ita
lian fellow.  He was with hi
m.  My sister, Miriam, she 
had three children.  Two gi
rls and one boy, beautiful children, very smart.  
Unfortunately they weren™t in -- they was 
killed by the Nazis, they put in the 
ovens.  My brother-in-law
 was wonderful, wonderful fellow.  He respected 
everyone of us.  Really we was in good 
harmony, the whole fa mily.  I had -- my 
father had another two brothers, another 
sister.  The brothers was very, very 
wealthy.  One, he had ten children, five 
boys and five girls.  Everyone, they was 
ma rried except two young boys.  They escaped during the capitulation of 

Mussolini.  He went with Abe Lindberg in Turkey and they are saved in Israel.  

But the others, the big family, everyone 
was killed by the Nazis.  My aunt, 
wonderful, she had five children.  The 
girl was ma rried with one baby.  My 
brother Nissim, he was ma rried and he had 
little girl a year 
and a half.  No one 
they came back. 
 

Q: Just one more thing about growing 
up.  Can you just -- what language did you 
speak, like at home?   You™ve 
me ntioned so ma ny languages --. 
 

A: Yeah, but the most i mportant is the Spanish, Ladino, you know, because it is my 
mother tongue -- lingua, language.  Because in the house, we speak Spanish, 

Ladino.  Also at this school, Italian and 
French.  Hebrew we 
learn at this school 
and also Greek with some French and a 
little bit Turkish.  We
 did -- milkma n who 
is to bring us every day milk and yoghur
t so we learned Turkish.  The woma n 
who come  to help for the washing the clot
hes, she used to speak Turkish.  You 
know, when you are young, is easy to cat
ch the language..  But the most 
important what I talk is Italian, Ladino, a
nd French.  That is it -- I think is enough.  

And also now Hebrew, I can ma nage very good and Greek also. 
 

Q: That™s a lot of languages.  Can you talk
 about what it was like being a Greek Jew 
growing up --.  
 

 
 
7
A: Very important, the best.  No matter, after my experience traveling all over the 
world, I find out is no religion better than
 ours, the religion, the Jews because I 
used to live in Italy with the Italians. 
 Wonderful, wonderful people.  Very nice, I 
respect them but it is not like us.  Now he
re with the Mexicans who hate the Jews 
and the Protestant, so many people who I 
me t over here, when I find out how they 
are mean and they hate the Jews, I find out the be st is ours.  Because we don™t 
hate no one.  Only we respect and so that 
is the most important .  We try to help 
everyone with no interest but the other relig
ion is just --.  They do for interest.  
Otherwise they don™t do nothing for nothing. 
  I respect my religion and I will die 
the way I am, this was the best. 
 

Q: Can you describe what it was like bei
ng Jewish when -- before the war though, in 
Rhodes? 
 

A: We was very religious.  We used to 
light the candles on Shabbat and we never 
warm up on Shabbat.  We didn™t open gas, 
we didn™t --. We  had, we used to keep 
warm the food from Friday night for Satu
rday.  We used to read, stay in the 
house.  In the morning, they used to go to  the temple.  Then when they used to 

come , we had breakfa st and lunchtime.  They used to go in the morning tefilla; 

and lunch, they used to say the berakhot
.  Saturday, for instance, the Havdalah, 
every Saturday night, the Havdalah and when
 was Shabbat, we used to light the 
candle and say the Kiddush.  But in our 
house, in every house in Rhodes, it was 
the same  thing.  Four o™clock, 5 o™cloc
k, no lights, no nothing.  Everything was 
ready for Shabbat.  We waited for th
e guys, the men who come from the shop, 
take a shower and then ready for the Kiddush and to be on the tables. 
 
Q: Did you find that it was difficult to be
 Jewish?   You me ntioned how you couldn™t 
keep certain jobs because you were Jewish. 
 
A: Yeah, over here, over here, yes.  When 
I applied to the Bank of America; they 
told me  to write down.  When I write 
down, I™m Jewish, they say we will call you 
back.  They never called me .  I applied in Safeway for a job.  When they saw 

Jewish, they didn™t ga ve me  job.   In ma ny places, I applied and they didn™t give  

me .  
 

Q: But you had me ntioned how beforethe war, you had that problem also? 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: I thought you said you ---. 

 

A: No, not in Rhodes.  Never, never, ne
ver.  We didn™t have no problem with the 
Italians.  The only thing -- the Greeks were anti-Semitic, was against us but we 

didn™t ha ve nothing in co mmon with them. 
 Now, they are very anti-Semitic --

how did you say?   They can™t stand the Je
ws.  They don™t like it.  It™s written on 
the wall, no Jews, no Americans.  That is in my country. 

 
 
8
 
Q: Okay, let me turn the tape over.  

 

(End of Side A, Tape 1) 

 

A: And I hope with the st rengt
h of God will be with us a
nd they will be safe, Eretz 
Israel.  Because without Israel all the Jews, 
they will be kaput.  They will be lost.  
Today we should work hard to keep that Eretz Israel and I hope some day we will 

have shalom, we will have p
eace in Eretz Israel.  Thank you. 
 

Q: I have some  more things if that™s all right. 

 

A: What? 

 

Q: Some  more questions.  If we can go to th
e Œ back to the beginning of the war, can 
you tell me  what you reme mber when the Germans -- what happened when the 

Germans invaded?   Wh at it was like then ---? 
 

A: –onthis? 

 

Q: No, it™s on.  The tape is on. 

 

A: Ison? 

 

Q: Yes.  Do you understand my question? 

 
A: Yes.  I supposed to do before.  Whe n I start to talk. 
 

Q: But I™m talking now about
 specifically when --. 
 

A: The Germans, they came? 

 

Q: Yes, specifically when they came. 

 

A: Okay.  The Germans, they came to Rhodes.  They was allied with the Italians.  
After Mussolini fe ll down, so the German
s they said, now we are the boss and 

you will do whatever we say.  When they cam
e to the Jewish quarter, they say we 
have to bring the me n; they have to come
 with the licenses of their job and then 
they have to work for us.  Every night 
they will come  back.  So everyone they 

took the license of their job.  They went 
there to that building and they didn™t 
came out.  After three days they spoke 
out again.  They came, they say, the 
wome ns and the children, they have to  co
me  -- they have to go to that building.  
In case they don™t go, all the me
ns they will be killed.  And they say they ha ve to 
bring all what you have, gold, money, silv
er, anything what you got in the house 
because you will be concentrated in one
 village.  With 
your money, you will eat 
and you will be safe.  Everyone, they t
ook all the -- what -- all the jewelry, 

 
 
9
whatever they had, they brought with them
.  We  went there and they came  out 
with two big boutava --. 
 
 [backgroundvoice] 

 

 Not boutava, no, no. 

 

 [male voice in background] 

 

A: They came out with big tray and weput the money, we put the gold, we put the 
silver, everything what we 
had and we gave it to them.  So ma ny peopl e, they 
didn™t want to give the money so they put
 it in the bathroom and they flushed the 
waters.  The building where we went
 was a commando, how you say, a building 
for the pilots, the offi cer, pilots, offi cers
.  You can imagine how ma ny toilets they 
have.  Everything was full of money, full of gold.  From there, the Germans, they 

took everything what we had and they used 
to beat us if they don™t give whatever 
they had.  After the, like I say, they put us 
in -- they gave the alarm and we start to 

walk to the port, you know, to the -- to take
 the boat.  Like that they took us to 
Pireo, took three days or five days to take
 to Pi reo.  You can imagine, was the, the 

23 of July; we arrived the August 16.  The 12
th
 was from Rhodes to Athens; from 
Athens to Auschwitz, the 23
rd
 and we arrived the 16
th
 in Auschwitz.  To Haidari 
was in July 23
rd
. 
 

Q: How much t i me  was there between the time when the Germans invaded and the 
time you we re deported? 
 
A: How ma ny hours? 
 

Q: How long was it?  How much time?   Wa s it hours, days, weeks? 

 

A: Only they gave us three days to be in the building and then after they took us they 
gave the alarm and we walked, walked, 
walked, so ma ny people.  They have 
pillows, they have blanke ts, they have  clothe s, you know, to change.  We  walking 

like a caravan to the depot to take th
e boat.  So how ma ny, I don™t know, they 
gave the alarm -- not to see us. 
 

Q: Were there any, were there any specific
 events that happened that you would be 
able to talk about that might stand out in
 your mi nd?   Some thing that you -- things 
that ma ybe you saw that had a very strong impact? 
 

A: The only thing I saw the three wome n who pa
ss away in Haidari.  Really was a --.  
I saw the Nazis how they beat the big shot
s in Athens without they --.  They call 
the me ns downstairs, down from the  buildi
ng.  Be fore they start to walk to the 
wagons, they have stones in the floor lik
e point.  Every time they took out the 
shoes and they led them to 
walk in the stones who was 
tall, how did you say?  like 
pieces of stone, like ma rble, pieces, in point.

Q: Likepebbles? 

 

A: You can put -- if you put your feet, y
ou will get bl ood.  You should see the blood 
running from the feet.  That ma ke me  sick
 to see those innocent people die from 
the -- how you say -- from thirsty because 
they ask one drop of water.  The me ns 
who was beaten from the Nazis with the wh
ipping and walk in there, in the --.  
That was very bad impression.  I sa y what 
will be the end of us?   What will be 
when we will be in their hands?  In f
act what happened was like that.  We  
suffered mo re from the Polish.  The Jews, the wome n of Pol a nd and from 

Hungarian.  They used to beat us, they used
 to steal our blanket, they used to steal 
our clothes, our panty, our bread.  Those pe
ople they do very hard to us.  Even if 
they want to save their own life, but they 
shouldn™t do that what they did it to us.  
Then not only that, they steal and they s
hould go to the blockova, the head of the 
block to say, the Italian they stole us.  Th
ey stole this, the Italian, they do that, the 
Italian.  We  didn™t know the language, we didn™t know Yiddish, we didn™t know 

German. We  didn™t know how to defend ourselv
es so that was very bad.  In fact, 
one Magda, she get me  one punch in my teet
h and she broke four 
teeth to me.  But 
I™m glad she died in Bergen-Belsen.  Otherw
ise, I would look for her.  Yesterday I 
find lady, no Friday, I me t lady.  She said
 do you mi nd shall I sit over here in the 
bus?  I say yes.  I say you got foreign 
accent like me.  From where are you?  She 
say, wait a fe w mi nutes. After she say, 
from Aust ria, Vienna, I say, Frau 
Ober_____; I start to talk German.  I sa
y you are not from Austria, German.You 
are____. I say how long you been here.  Do you have a nice apartment in the 

____.  She said no, we got nice house, nice house.  Little house, not too big.  But I 

like Brazil.  I say, oh very Schoen.  I st
art to talk in German. _______.  Brazil, 
Rio de Janeiro.  Oh, ya, ya.  I say, you 
are Nazis!  Your husband is one of the 
Nazis who left Germany to go to Brazil.
  And now from Br
azil, they would 
recognize him and he came over here in the Spanish because he speaks Spanish.  

How do you like that? 
 

Q: What did she say? 

 

A: She say, no, no.  Do you have children?  
 She say no.  Why you are going to now 
five o™clock, two o™clock, you going to dow
ntown.  I told in Spanish to pick up 
your husband because they will recognize hi
m.  You™re going to pick up him and 

to go home.  Not to be alone.  But I wi
sh to go with you to recognize him and I 
will choke hi m.  Because he Nazis.  Lookhow clever, they went there.  They will 

recognize.  They spent so much and after 
they change the --. They went back to 
Vienna, they fi nd out they will recognize them and so they come to Los Angeles.  

If I had time, I will go to see where sh
e will st op and where she will go back.  I 
will hide my self but I di dn™t have time.  I didn™t want to aggravate it myself.  

Look the Nazi.  Did you hear on the televisi
on?   The Nazis now what they want?   

Me, no Nazi, me  no.  You are not, your husband, yes. 
 

 
 
11
Q: Okay.  If we  can -- we ended up jumpi
ng around a little bit but 
if we can go back 
to when you were in Auschwitz?   No, you were in more than one camp, is that 
correct? 
 

A: No,Auschwitz. 

 

Q: That was the only one? 

 

A: Only Auschwitz, yeah.  From Auschwitz
, they send us to Buchenwald, Villest adt 
to work in factory.  We  didn™t have no tim
e.  We didn™t know if it was daytime or 
nighttime .  We were underground. 
 

Q: We would like to have, as much as possible ---. 

 

A: What? 

 

Q: Do you want me  to stop for a mi nute? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: Do you need me  to stop for a mi nute? 

 

A: What you mean?  [Other voi
ce in background]  Go ahead. 
 

Q: They would like to have as ma ny, as 
much eyewitness testimony as possible about 
what -- things that you saw in the camp.  
So if there is anything else you can talk 
about that you saw while you were in the camp? 
 

A: What?   I said so ma ny t hings.  What th
e witnesse s.  I can 
tell all the girls who 
were with me 
 

Q: That™s not what I meant.  Just if th
ere™s any more things that happened that you 
haven™t me ntioned yet. 
 

A: The only thing what happened in Villes
tadt where I was working; one lady, her 
name  was Margot from Berlin.  She m
oved where she was, she jumped in the 
river and she disappeared.  The oberau _____ th
e chief of the soldiers, they say if 
she not comi ng back, ten of you, they will be
 killed. For one, ten.  She pick up so 
many and one of us, Matilda Israel, was one
 with them.  [More conversation with 
other person Œ not in English].  Thatwas very important.  For 24 hours, we was 

trembling, shaking, what would be from us.  Why they would kill them, the ten 

for one.  Finally they put the reflectors, the 
lights, boats, airplanes, they find her.  

They brought and then they put in Œ on the 
floor and everyone, they have to step 
on her.  They have to kick her. We  have to do the whipping.  We  have to whip to 

her, to that woma n. 
 

 
 
12
Q: They ma de you do that? 
 

A: We did it because they gave us.  She 
was crying and crying and crying.  She used 
to talk in German because she was from 
Berlin.  She used to say, I will ne ver do 
again.  I will never do again.  Please forg
ive me , forgive me .  She used to cry, all 
the lady I feel sorry for Margot.  I reme mb
er that -- was very emotional.  We was 

very depressed for that case.  That wa s 
very important too.  When I was working, 
my nail, the nail went down and then wa
s broken.  They say I do purposely and so 
they punish me  for no reason.  You know, it 
not the right way what I did it.  I 
don™t think so.  Maybe she will change and she will put di fferent way? 
 

Q: Oh,Sharon? 

 

A: Eh?  

 

Q: YoumeanSharon? 

 

A: I say because when I start, for inst ance,
 my na me  is Miru and so, I was in the 
island of Rhodes and they pick me  up from the Nazis and I spoke over here how 

ma ny days I  was in that building.  But I 
should do before -- when I start in the 
beginning, no? 
 

Q: Well we went a little bit out of orde
r because when you started, I didn™t want to 
interrupt you. 
 

A: Yes, I know.  Wa
s not the writer. 
 

Q: They can rearrange. 

 

A: So how will she do? 

 

Q: Okay, well ma ybe if you just want to 
right now, just go over 
briefly the order in 
which things happened to ma ke it easier so
 that --.  You know what I™m saying?   
 

A: Because when I start the beginning, I s
hould tell about the building where we was 
for three days and before they called th
e mens and after the wo mens.  We brought 
all the mone y, everything, we should star
t, step by step.  I don™t know why I 
didn™t.  The last time, I did it but t
oday I don™t know what happened to me . 
 

Q: That™sokay. 

 

A: I should do. 

 

Q: That™s partly my fault too. 

 

 
 
13
A: No, no.  Because the begi nning I should --.  When I start to say I™m from the 
island of Rhodes, Greece now.  In 194 _, since July, 1913, they called the 
Germans camp to the Jewish quarter and th
ey ask the me n they should come  with 
their license to be present in that build
ing.  That building was the headquarter of 
the pilots, the officer, the aviation.  I s
hould do that before.  Then the me n they 

went there for three days.  After three da
ys, they start to ask all the wome n and 
the children, they should come  too and to
 bring all the possession they had, the 
silver, the money, the gold to bring in toge
ther.  Then they would stay all day long 
there, they would stay long in -- they w
ould be in one building, in one village.  
Your money, you will support yourselves.  I should start like this.  From there 

they took us after three days, they gave 
the alarm and we went to walking like a 
caravan like you see in the movie, they 
walking with all th
e belonging together 
like bl ankets, pillows, all the clot hes, wh
atever they had.  Luggage, together and 
we went to the boat and after five days 
we arrive in Pireo and from Pireo they 
took us to At hens where the camp wa s ther
e waiting for the train, for the wagons.  
We stayed in that pl ace, that camp they 
call Haidari.  We stayed three days there 
in the Haidari and after they put us inthe wagons.  In the wagons, during the three 

days in Athens, three wome n they pass away because they wa s thirsty.  After we 

went to in the wagons.  When we reach in Serbia, three me ns pass away.  Manos 

S______.The three me n pass away because was 
thirsty and they died.  They throw 
in one hole over there.  After we start --
 they hided us for ma ny days.  During the 
day, we was hiding.  At night
 time , we was in the train walking.  We  didn™t know 
what was the destiny of us.  Finally we 
arrive  in Auschwitz.  Auschwitz was the 
end of the life of our parents.  I should start like this. 
 

Q: Okay.  So now you did.  Your brothers a
nd sisters as well, were they with you at 
that time? 
 

A: Yes, in the train we was with all my fa
mily; my father, my mother.  My father, he 
used to read the perck, not th
e perck, the -- some  part of 
the tehillin (psalms).  He 
used to read continuously, continuously, 
continuously until 
we arrived.  My 
mother, she was sitting there.  We  didn™t 
have room to move.  We didn™t have no 
toilets.  We  didn™t have nothing.  My brot
hers, my sister, my brother-in-law, even 
we want to ma ke our necessity and we sa
y, turn your face.  In the same  train, in 
the same people, in the same where we 
were sitting because they didn™t ha ve no 
room.  My t hree nephews, my sister-in-law, she was very young, twenty-five 

years old.  He r little girl was a year and 
a half.  My brother at that time  was 28 
years, I don™t know.  My father was 71, 
my mother 60, 61 when they arrive in 
Auschwitz.  They promise us we will s
ee ever y night. During the day, they will go 
to work.  But was not like that.  Only we heard by the French when we smell the 

meat, barbecue.  They used to look like th
ey have steak in th e -- steak barbecue.  
We say, look they eating barbecue with th
e music and the  French people what 

was over there before us, they say no.  They
 are your parent s, they are cremated.  
At that time, we didn™t know what mean 
cremated.  Because in our country, in our 
little island, we was very naïve.  We  kne
w what means cre mation because in our 
Bible they say cremated, cremation is 
against the law  We  never thought they 

 
 
14
would cremated those people.  My brother,
 they took my brothers and my brother-
in-law, they choose to work and also my self.  But my brother Josef went to 
Mauthausen, Nissim wa s in Dachau, my br
other-in-law was in Rideltow and those 
things I find out because I wrote to Re d Cross.  They answered me  and they told 

me  where they was dead.  That is the r
eason I know where I lost my brothers.  
Myself, I was working in Villest adt before for two months, years.  I was working 

in Auschwitz bringing barrels of food to th
e kitchen or bring water to the kitchen.  
After breaks, after they send us to Villest
adt.  Wa s factory of munition.  My job 
was gleeov.  I can™t translate what me an
 gleeov.  The only thing I know was a big 
trunk.  I put pieces of me tal.  The mach
ine gun I don™t know. Put 
it there and then 
put it in the Œ in one place, 500 mil kilo
watt to ma ke hard.  Every 20 mi nute, I 
have to change the trunk and put the othe
r.  In the meantime, the 20 mi nute until 
they would be cool off.  I used to help 
the other girls who they couldn™t make it.  
We worked 12 hours daily for one week.  One night, 12 hours.  Tachi and Nachi 

they used to call.  But we never saw 
when was daytime. Whe n was nighttime  
because we was working under tunnel.  We  never saw sunshine.  We  never saw 

the time , what time , wha t  day.  We  di
dn™t know nothing.  We  was working like 
slave until the Russian they start to come and they move us in other pl ace to work 

in pieces of assembly of ai
rplane.  We stayed there thre
e, four days or one week.  
From there they took us another place.  They put in the wagons, almost the end I 

think.  They left us in wagons, closed of Villestadt, no Theresienstadt .  They 

closed the wagons for five days.  How ma
ny girls was dead and we didn™t have no 
toilet, no air, only they wa s lucky with 
chan.  After five days over there, you 
should see the cholera they have, the chol
era.  The Russian camp, they liberated 
us.  They say to us, ﬁkein arbeit, kein brotﬂ; if you don™t work for you, you can™t 

have bread.  The strong girls,
 they have to go to work.  You have to go.  To me , 
they pick up myself to work in -- to 
ma ke bread.  Another also to ma ke bread.  
The other in the kitchen to cook so we 
worked just for us.  Some  a fternoon, we 
used to go to the Russian commander to 
clean the rooms and to cook for them.  
Every time when I used to go there, I used
 to steal one knife, knife, one fork and 
one time I stole a little cushion.  Until th
ey sent us to Prague.  From Prague I 
escaped twice.  I went to Budapest to as
k help for my friends who was very sick 
with this dysentery.  We started all over. 
 

Q: Where were you at the 
time  of the liberation? 
 

A: The liberation in Theresienstadt.  I was liberated in Theresienstadt, in May 13, 
1945 
 

Q: Can you describe those events? 

 

A: There I was working like I told you, work
ing in the -- to ma ke bread; the factory 
to ma ke bread.  Afternoon, I had to work
 in the commando of the -- the Russians™ 
commando, to clean the rooms and to prepare food for them, to cook foods for 

them.  After we used to go to our barr
ack.  For a little bit,
 I don™t know for how 
long. After they sent us to Prague.  From 
Prague we went to the Italian consul.  

 
 
15
The Italian to help -- they help us.  Th
ey gave nice, nice place to live like --how 
do you say -- like a academy school.  A school because the kids was on vacation 
and they gave us the bed.  Then they gave us money and we can go for shopping 

or to see.  We  didn™t pay the carfare b
ecause when we showed the number of our 
arm, they didn™t say nothing.  We  us ed to run from one bus to the other, free.  

Free rides we had.  Then after --. 
 

Q: How long --? 

 

A: I don™t know how long. 

 

Q: You don™t know how long you were there? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber, I can™t recall.  The onl
y thing they took us like before I say to 
Rattotine, Hungaria, but I went myse lf to 
Budapest to pick up me dicine.  Sha____ 
for the girls who had dysentery, yeah. 
 Also they gave me , 1,200 me rangos, 
money.  I bought apples, sugar, some thing to
 give nutrition to the girls.  When I 
came back after three days and a half a
nd two nights, by train because the station 
was tall, I arrived and I couldn™t find them.  
After they told me  where they are.  I 
walked so many kilome ters and I don™t 
know.  I can™t describe how I arrive.  
Finally I me t them.  I gave the medicines. 
 I gave what I brought so like that I did 

my best to save human being.  But thos
e girls they reme mber me .  When is 
Mother™s Day, when is Rosh Hashanah or
 Pesach, anyway they call me  often.  I 
call them because one she live in Vanc
ouver, Wa shington; the other live in 
Miami, the other live in other part of 
Miami, one live in Johannesburg, the other 
between Switzerland and France.  I am in 
contact with them, once in a while we 
see each ot her.  We meet  each other, we ta
lk.  That is pa rt of what I went through 
with those Ge rmans.  How we should forget them.  How they can deny that didn™t 

exist Auschwitz, no Birkenau.  Who put our numbers on our arm.  My number is 

____. That I have to learn by me mory because
 I didn™t know before.  They used to 
with the whipping; they gave me  so ma ny 
Œ they whipped so many ti mes to me.  I 
have to learn.  We  say no mo
re Nazis, no more but the 
Nazis still they are around.  
We have here in California, so ma ny.  In fact, a couple of days ago I me t 

some body.  You think it™s enough? 
 

Q: Yeah, I™m just looking.  Okay.  Can 
you tell, after you were in Italy, where did 
you go from there, did you say? 
 

A: After ma ny months, we was in -- so
 March, just a mi nute, May 30, we was 
liberated and we arrive in August, the 
end of August to Italy.  We  went to 

Bologna, Italy to the Jewi sh communit
y.  We are gombrudi number nine.  
Because over there is Milan, they di dn™t 
have room for us.  Modena they di dn™t 
have room for us.  I say the only pl ace we
 should go to Bologna to see if we will 

find any place to stay there.  Wa s -- th
e building was destroyed but they didn™t 
have no windows; they didn™t have doors.  We  us ed to sleep in the hallway, we 

was 52 between boys and girls sleeping in th
e floor.  The Jewish community, they 

 
 
16
gave us blankets and also they gave few 
ma ttresses and they used to give us three 
liras to go to eat once -- to 
hot kitchen.  They call hot ki
tchen and we used to cook 
ourselves.  They used to give few dollars
, few liras to cook in our place, in our 
community.  Like that until everyone they st
art to be settled.  So me they went to 
South Africa and some  they went to C
ongo Belgium, some  they went to United 
States and so me  they stay in
 Milan.  Some  they went to 
Buenos Airs but we are in 
touch with everyone and some  they are in Israel. 
 
Q: From there where did you go? 

 

A: Myself I came to the United States. 

 

Q: Do you know what year that was? 

 

A: But I had hard time because I didn™t 
know the language and I couldn™t find job.  I 
had hard, very hard time .  Beside withmy fa mily I was not so happy.  They didn™t 

-- we came -- I didn™t get along with them 
because their me ntality was different of 
mi ne.  I decided to take  one room in some  place and I used to pay $40 monthly.  

In the meantime, I wrote to Italy to se
nd me money to fr iend of mi ne until I will 
find job. 
 

Q: Do you remember what year it was when you came here? 

 

A: Here I came in 1950; July 18, 1950. 

 

Q: What type of work did you plan on______? 
 
A: From New York -- First of all I was, 
before to come to the United States I 
supposed to come  with DP, displaced person from Ger many.  Because only I was 

Italian but Rhodes,
 the island of Rhodes.  .  .  . 
 

[End of Tape 1] 

 

Q: Okay.  You were saying displaced persons --? 

 

A: I had Italian passport bu
t Rhodes passed to the Greece 
in 1948.  I didn™t want to 
be Greek.  I pick up, I choose to be DP, 
displaced person to come  to the United 
States.  I have to go to Bremen in Germ
any be cause the American, they used to 
send soldiers to Germany and the boats empty.  The boats, the navy, they used to 

come  back and bring refugees from Germ
any.  I was in Germany again for three 
weeks to see those lousy face of Germans.  But I never came out from there, from 

my room.  I never going to eat out because 
I don™t want to hear the steps of the 
Germans and I don™t want to hear their vo
ice.  I came -- when the time c ame we 
went to the boat, to the navy and so I cam
e to United States, to New York.  From 
New York, I came to Los Angeles, three nights and two days by train.  I came  to 

Chicago, the train -- I mi ssed the train.  I 
have to stay another 24 hours there with 

 
 
17
no food, no nothing.  Because I didn™t know 
the language.  I didn™t know what to 
ask to say give me  tuna sandwich or 
cheese sandwich; I didn™t know until I 
arrived to Los Angeles.  When I arrive
d to Los Angeles, my  aunt she say, you 
know, I was in the depot.  She came to pi
ck me  up.  She say, the first thing, you 
know, now you are in America.  Your name  
is no Miru any more.  We have to go 
and change to Mary.  I say I™m very sorry; my parents they gave me  Miru, I want 
to keep Miru.  If you don™t like Miru, ca
ll Mary.  First of al
l I say, Aunt, I got 
your mother™s name .  I™m the only survive who got your mo ther™s name .  We  had 

four Mirus in the family.  I™m the only survive, why you don™t like?   I say okay, 

you call me  anything you want and I did like this because I was exhausted from 

the trains with no food.  I came and you start 
to give me  lecture, to say not Miru, 
Mary!  I stay a few months over there, se
ven mo nths with my aunt.  I didn™t get 

along.  I went -- I took one room with somebody.  In the meantime, I didn™t have 

no money.  I brought with me  $500 but was eas
y to spend.  I wrote to Italy.  I say 
when I will work, I will pay you.  They se
nd me every month $100.  Like that.  I 
can pay $40 and the $60 I can eat and take 
the carfare.  I had more hard time in 

United States than in Germany.   Bec a
use in Germany I know I was obligated, 
with no choice.  But over here, I couldn™
t speak the language, I couldn™t find job 
and I didn™t have no place to stay.  I ha
d very bad life.  For one year I was 
desperat e until I deci de to go back to Ital y.  I say I wish to fi nd a job to make my 

ticket and to go back.  A friend of mi ne, 
my cousin who I saved from Ausc hwitz, 
who got diarrhea, she say come  to Seattl
e and I will find job for you.  I went to 
Seattle; I start to work but I had hard 
time because I didn™t know the language.  I 

was working in _______but very hard to explain to me .  I took time from the 

other people to teach me, to tell me what
 to do and my time also. They fire me .  
Finally I look in the telephone book, Italia
n family, Italian place and I find Euro-
city st ore and I star t to work in Euro-c
ity store.  After five years, I became 
American citizen.  I say, goodbye everyone. 
 I™m going to Europe to see where 
will be my destiny.  I was going to Israel a
nd in Israel they have war after war.  I 
say not for me .  When I went to Italy, I fi
nd out the life was very
 hard to find job.  
I say, I will come  back to United Stat es. 
 I will work more.  When I will have 
more money, I™ll go back to Israel.  That is what I did.  Now in the meantime, my 

health is no good.  My health
 is very deteriorated. 
 

Q: Is there anything else you can 
think of that you™d like to add? 
 

A: Eh?  

 

Q: Is there anything else that you can think 
of that you would like to add before we 
fi ni sh?  
 

A: I don™t know what to say. 

 

Q: Okay, then I™ll just say that this in
terview is recorded on August 30, 1992 in Los 
Angeles, California. 
 

 
 
18
A: Yes. 
 

Q: That™s it.
