T hank
sfor being our guest today.
 
You have so much to cover forusin a short hour, so we'll  
get started imm ediately.  
 

 
W orldW ar II began, of course
,  
in September
 
1939 when Nazi Germany invaded 
Poland.  The following May, May
 
1940, Germany attacked France.You were nearly 2 years 
old when thathappened.  Bef ore we turn to the war years and what it meantf or youand your 
fam ily, tell usf irsta little bitabout your parents and their lif e, what itwas like before the war 
began andfor you and your siblings. 
 
>
> Albert Garih: W ell, m y parents were born in Constantinople, which is now Istanbul, in 
T urkey.  At that tim e it was part of  theempire, it was the turn of the century. T hey were born in 

1901 and 1903. They lived there until 1923.
 
 
Af t e r th e F i rs t W orl d
 
W ar, the em pirem ade the wrong decision, thebaddecision, of 
siding with Germany. So after the FirstW orldW arthere was a conference in Versailles, near 
Paris.  And theVersailles treaty dism antled the em pire. Theem pirewas coverin g what is 
today Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine. T here was no Israel atthat time. Saudi Arabia,all of  
these areas.
  
W ell, after the Versailles treaty, all of  these parts given to, you know, different 
countries
, m
ostly Britain and France.  Franceinherited LebanonandSyria.  And Britain 
inherited Egypt, Jordan, and related Palestine.

A t tha t tim e ,T u rke y
 
--
 
the em pire was dism antled.  And the only thing that couldbe 
salvage
d f rom  that was
 
--
 
that's when S
trong
 M
an cam e topower in Turkey, Mustaf a
 
A t at ur k
, 
also known asf ather ofmodern Turkey.  Andat that tim ethe Jews there were a bit worried 
about theirf ate, what was in storef or them ,because they had seen the genocide of the 
Arm eniansat thebeginning of the century, 1905, I think.
 
 
W hen Mustaf a cam e to power, the Greeks, the strong Greek community living, they 
we r e
 
--
 
they f ledback to Greece. The Jews were, you know, uncomfortable. T hey didn't know 
what to expectf rom that nationalist movem ent. And a lot of them f led.
 
 
My parents had been educated
 
--
 
c r e at e d 
in 1860. T hey started opening schoolsall 
over the em pire whereeducation was provided in French. Som y parents were absolutely 

f luent in French. Their French was absolutely perf ect.
  
So France, whenthey decided to leave 
T urkey, France was a naturaldestinationfor them.  Ok?  So they m oved to France
 
--
 
a c t ua lly,  
they
 
--
 
they didn't know each other. T hey met in Paris. T hey arri ved inParis in 1923. They 
got m arried in 1927.  1928.  Andm y sisters were born in 1930
 a
nd1933.  And I was born in 
1938.
 
>
> Bill Benson:  So you were the little brother.
 
>> Albert Garih: I was thebaby of thef am ily.  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described yourf atheras ver y sm art but self
-
edu c a t e
d
.  T e ll u s  a lit t le b it .
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  My father, hisfam ily was very poor.  At theage of 10 he hadto work 
to providefor hisf am ily, f or hisparents.  Hisfather was rather old. My mother'sf ather
 
--
 
father's m other was asecond marriage tom y grandf ather. So, youknow, advancedage 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

already when m y father was born.  So m yf ather had to work.  Butthatdidn't stop himf rom  
being educated. Andhis French was justasgood asm y m other's,actually. 
 
 
So when they decidedto go to France, France was thenatural destinationf or them . 
T hat's where they m et.  And they started working.
  
My m other's French was so goodthat she 
was hired in a company, in a sm all company. She was a secretary. She was typing letters.  
Once shem adenota typo, butam istake.  She had to write a letterto 
Haussm ann
,  t h e o ne 
who createdthe wide avenues inParis. And m y m other hadnever heardof any other Osm an 
than 
O -s-m -a -n
,of  theem pire, but this shenever heard so she wrote instead of 
H-a -u -s-s-m -a -
n -
n, she wrote O
-s-m -a -
n.  Andthe colleagues made fun of her.  But it was her boss whocam e 
to
 
her defense and said when you speak another language the way she speaks French, you 
can laugh ather. 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parents, because they hadm ovedf rom Turkey to Paris, there were 

issues about their citizenship status. Tell usabout 
th a t . 
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  That'sone of thef irstexperiences. Particularly I gotf rom m yf ather, 

actually.  They were im m igrants in France. Of course they lost theirT urkish citizenship. T hey 
were stateless. So in the 
‚
30s, after af ew years of living in France,they appliedf or citizenship.  
But at thattim e,f or whatever reason, there was a
lready som e anti
-
Se m it ism  in  
France.  You 
hadthe movem ent in1933 that was created in France called 
F i re  C
ross, which was af ar right 
m ovement,f ascists.  For whatever reason they froze all the applicationsfor naturalization at 

th a t tim e.
  
Som y parents had to wait until after the war, until 1948,25 years after imm igrated 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

to France to get French citizenship.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So inpractical term s thatm eant
 
--
 
you used thephrase 
ﬁst a te le ss. ﬂ
  
That 
m eant they had no citizenship
 a
nywhere.
 
>> Albert Garih:  No. As stateless, they hadto report every si x m onths or something like that 
to the imm igrationoff ice in Paris. T he lower
-
r anking off icials there. My f ather was very pro ud.  
He suffered very m uch from  that.  He never really adjusted to France.  My mother was m ore 

f lexible. She adjusted.  She was happy in France
 b
ut not m y father.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  sorr y, go ahead.
 
>> Albert Garih:  No, no.
 
>> B ill B e
nson:  As you mentioned, you were born in 1938.  And 1938 was, of  course, a pivotal 
year to the power of  Nazi Germ any and a time thatfor your parentsm ust
 
--
 
you described for 
your parents it was an om inous tim e. W hy was that? 
 
>> Albert Garih: 1938 was
 
a ver y glorious year.  It started with theannexationof Austriaby 
Germ any.  You know that Hitler was not even a Germ an.  He was born in Austria. Ok? The 

f irst territory that he wanted toabsorb into theReich was Austria. And in March1938, there 
wa s
 
the annexationof Austria by Germ any.
 
 
At that tim e, the German troops whenthey entered into Vienna, they were acclaim ed.  
Ok? T hat wasf irst event thathappened in 1938. The second one was a Munich conf erence.  
Munich is a city in the south of Germany
 
in Bavaria.  And Hitler had conveneda conf erence in 
Munich where he invited Mussolini
,  
was hisf riend, the dictatorf rom  Italy, f ascist, the French 
p
rim e m in is t e r, a nd  t he B rit is h  P rim e M
inister Nevil le Chamberlain.  And he prom ised to 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

Chamberlain that i
f  
[ N o A u d i o]
.  
The British prim em inister was ver y n aive, went back to 
England saying, ok, well, we're going to have peace inour tim e. 
 
 
T hat was in September
 
1938.  September
 
1,1939, the German troops marched into 
Poland.  Anywa y, the French prim e m ini
sterwas not sonaive, but he still went along.  I don't 
know f or what reason. He had no choice.  He signed the Munich treaty.  That was treason, 
actually.  That was thesecond eventthat happened in1938. 
 
 
T he third one was Kristallnacht.  Kristallnach
t or the Night of  Broken Glass. 
  
There 
was a young Germ anJew was living in Paris whose parents hadbeenm oved
 
--
 
they were 
living in Germ any. T hey had been moved close to the Polish border.  He was ver y upset
 a
nd 
ver y worried about the fate of  his paren
ts.  Som ehow he decided to take action intohis own 
hands.  He killed a junior diplom atf rom the Germ an Em bassy in Paris.  That's all it tookfor 
Hitler to launchhis henchm en into a rampagethatbecame known as Kristallnacht, the night of  
9 of  Novem ber
 
19
38. I think it was 9.  I'm  notsure.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he night of  the9ththroughthe 10th.
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  I think so.  And during that night they destroyed synagogues. They 
killed 91 people.  T hey arrested hundreds of people and sent them  to 
concentration camps.  At 
thattim e we were not talking about death cam ps. It was concentration camps. T hef irst ones 

were created inGermany
: 
 
Mauthausen, Bergen
-
Belsen. They started arresting Jews, you  
know.  
 

 
W hen Hitler cam etopower in 1933, in Jan
uar y
 
1933, soon af ter his arrival to power 
the Reich
 
--
 
the Reichwas the equivalent of the capital here. It was set ablaze supposedly by 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
a Swedish Com munist
s
.  But apparently theSS blew onthef lam estom ake it bigger.  That 
was also an excuse. Hitler was ver y good at 
m
aking excusesto goon a rampage. That's 
when he askedfor special powers, which hegot f rom  Hindenburg, an old
 
--
 
a h e r of r om  t he 
FirstW orldW ar, the Germ an Arm y, President of  Germ any at that time.  Andheobtainedf ull 
powers f rom  him
.  
 
 
And when 
H
i nd e nb
u
rgdied in 1934,one year later, he 
ap
pointed 
--
 
Hit le r
 
appointed 
h isse lf  f u
hrer
 
and tookfull powers.  That was a total dictatorship. T hey started enacting the 
Nurem berg Laws thatdeprives the Jews of most of their basic rights.  Lawyers were debarred.  

Doctors were notallowed to practicem edicine. T eachers were notallowed
 
--
 
were kicked out 
of  public schools and so were children. It was ver y bad. And that was the backdropagainst 

which we were li vin g in Francebecause France was also threatened. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And as you said,he,of  course, a year after theagreement that Chamberlain 

went back and said we'll have peacef orever,a year later hem arches into Poland,and then 
about sevenm onths later invades theLow Countries
: 
 
Luxemburg, Belgium , and France, in 
Ma y
 
1940. And asonce the invasion of France began and the Germans began advancing on 
Paris, there was am ass exodus of people thatf ledParis, perhaps as m any as 80% of the 
population.  You said to me that yourfam ily
 
--
 
this is your words.  
ﬁ
Itall began with the exodus 
f rom  Pa ri s .
ﬂ  
>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  That was thef irstexperience we had. W hen the war broke out
 
--
 
when Germ any m arched into Poland, the Germ anArm y m arched into Poland, France and 

Britain declared
 
war on Germany because they had broken their prom ise not to gofurther,the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
Munich conf erence
,  
so they declared war.  But between Septem berand May
 
--
 
Septem ber
‚
39 
and May
 
1940, it was what was called thephony war
, w
hich m eansthatthe Germ ans were 
unde
r  S i e gf r i ed  l a n guage was 
a fort side
 
lineon the German side ofthebor
der and 
the French 
on the French side of the border. Nothing happened. T here was no m ovement atthat time.
 
 
1940, Hitler launched a massive invasion wit h bom bardm ents starting in Norw
a y,  
Denmark, Holland, Belgium , Luxemburg andFrance.  France was invaded
 
--
 
half  of  France 
was invaded.  Francewas divided into two zones.  You hadthe occupied zone and the 
so -
calledf ree zone. And you hadthedem arcation line. 
 
 
T he French governm ent capitulatedat that tim e.  They signed a separate Arm istice 
andtheyf orm ed a new governm ent, which wa s a collaborationist governmentheaded by 
Petain 
who was a hero, the hero called,f rom  the FirstW orldW ar. There was a big battleand 
he was in chargeof
 
that. Sohe was a national hero in France.  Sohe was appointedhead of  
state.  He im mediately started collaborating wi th the Germ an governm ent. There was actually 
a meeting between Hitler and he I think ina place
 
--
 
they f orm ed a collaborationist gove
rnm ent 
which settled inVichy.  Vichy was just southof the dem arcation line in the f ree zone. 
 
 
Andat thattime the collaborationist governm ent started, you know, in the 1940 or 
1941. T hey enactedastatute of the Jews whi ch was based on the Nuremberg Laws deprivi ng 

the Jews of m ost of their basic rights.  Ok? 
 
 
So when France was invaded in May
 
1940, the people of Paris, not only the Jews, 
ever yone,f led south.  W e followed the crowd. W e went on atrain with m y mother andm y 
sisters.  My f ather stayed behind.  He had towork.  He didn't want to leave his work.  Sohe 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
stayed behind.  Butm y m otherand m y sisters and me, we went along with a crowd. W e went 
south
, d
own to the Loire River, f am ousfor itsbeautiful chateau
xs
 
allover.  T hey're m ost 
m agnif ic
ent, actually.
 
 
My m other
 
--
 
that Idon't rem ember.  I was 2 years old.  My m other told m e that we 
slept ina chateau
x
.  Itwa s n o t e xa ctly
 
--
 
we were not sleeping, you know, in comf ortor 
anything. W e were sleeping onthef loor, on straw.  Andm y m other 
had nothing to feed m e.  
As a baby, I was cryin g.  I was hungry.
  
M y m other toldm e that at thattim e there was a soldier 
am ong the people who hadf led, a French soldier.  I was disturbing people trying to sleep. I 
was cr ying.  So the soldier gave m y m other som e Schnapps and said
, 
ﬁG
ive him  some 
Schnapps
.  T
hat will c alm  him down.
ﬂ 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
It did.  Apparently it did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Albert, you used
 
the words afew m oments ago, "Wef ollowed the crowd." But 
the im age Ihave and Ithink that you've shared with m e isone that thoseofus who are 

younger have seen inm ovies
:  l
iterally hundreds of thousandsof people getting out their bikes, 
carts, horses, occasionally a car.  It was chaos.  And while you're f leeing, you're being strafed 

by f ighter planesand bom bed.  And, inf act, Ithink during that, you lost somefam ily m embers.
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes, actually.  My grandm other, an uncle andanauntand two cousinsf led by 

car. W e were straf ed. W e don't know whether it was by the Germ an Air Forceor the Italian 
A i r F o rc e
 b
ecause it was called a stab in theback. The story goes thatapparently it was the 
ItalianAir Force that strafedpeople likethat. Must have been a combination of both. Abom b

fell onthe car where my uncle, m y grandmother, m y aunt,and two cousins were. T hey we re 
all killed by thebom b that fell on their car. 
T
hey were just crossing the river when the bomb 
fell onthe car. So that was m y m other lost her m other, sister and a brother.  T hat was 
t h e 
f i rs t  
tragedy that hit usduring that war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you would, after getting to the chateau
x
, at som epoint went back to 
P a ri s .
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would rem ain in Paris inyour apartmentf or another two years until 
June
 
1942. Tell us what you can about those two years back in Paris and the eventsthat led 
your parents
 
to
 
decidethey needed to leave their apartment in 1942.
 
>> Albert Garih: Actually, it was not their decision.  My father
 
--
 
we were poor. W e were not 
rich at all.  Myf ather hadm anaged to obtain
 
--
 
he was workin g in agarm ent factory.  His boss 
was also a Jew.  His boss allowed us to live in the janitor's apartment in the garm entf actory.  
So I guess we saved on the rent or som ething like that. My f atherwas running two jobs at the 
s
am e time.  He had three children.  My m other was not working because I was too young. So 
she hadto take care of children. So m yf ather was running two jobs.  He was working at the 
garm entfactory, doing thepayroll.  He was an accountant. And in the evening we would go to 
a movie theater.  He was doing that in the evening.  He was working
 
--
 
so he was a very 
courageous manand very hard
-
work ing, taking care of hisfam ily. 
 
 
As I said, Ithink it was in 1941 that the Vichy governm ent enactedthe statute 
of  th e 
Jews which was based literally on the Nuremberg Laws.  So we wer e not allowed to go into 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
14
 
public transit. W e were not allowed to practice som eprof essions. And we were not allowed in 
theaters or places like that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you're living in this apartm ent while all of  theserestrictions arebeing 
im posedon yourf am ily.  Inf act, if  you don'tm ind, share what you told me about an incident
 
--
 
with a lot of bitter irony to it where your mother handed youtoone of your neighbors over the 

ra i
l of your apartm ent.
 
>> Albert Garih: That was later.  That was later.  During that period,when theVichy 

governm ent enactedthe Nurem berg Laws, you know, the Nurem berg Laws
 
--
 
when a 
com pany was owned by a Jew, it was 
conf iscated
. 
 
It was gi ven to
 
an  A r
yan, non
-Je wish ,  
m anager.  Meanwhile, m y f ather
™s
 
bosshadtof lee and go into hiding.  He came back after the 
war and he survi ved, but he was dispossessed of his com pany.  Of  course, they f orced usto 

vacate the janitor's apartm ent.W e had tof ind an apartment in no tim e.  And that was in 
J u ly
 
1942.  
 
 
And in July
 
1942 is a som ber period becausethat's when
 
--
 
you know, the roundups in 
Paris started in1941. T hey would arrest theJews, send them  to transit camp
s 
n o r t h of P ar i s.  
And f rom  there they would
 
sendthem onthis cattle car trainsto Auschwit z.  So it was always 
ver y dangerous.
 
 
So we m oved intoa tiny apartm ent,two rooms.  Not two bedroom s,two room s, 
period
; a
 
tiny kitchen and onetoilet. T hat was it.  Nobathroom ,nothing like that.  No show
e rs .   
No hot water.  No hotwater.  T hat was where we lived during thatperiod. 
 
 
In 1942 m y parents saw this.  T hey were rounding uppeople all the tim eand they 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
15
 
were very concerned about that. Sothey sent m y sisters andm e toaf arm  outside of Paris.  
T hey didn't tell the ladies
 
--
 
it was two ladies.  I suppose them en must have been enrolled in 
the Arm y andmaybe takenprisonersby theGerm ans. I don't know.  I never saw any m an in 

thatfarm.  I saw two wom en, two sisters. Madame Achtouise, I remem be
r  t he  na m e  of  t he 
lady.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your sisters are with you.  Right?
 

>> Albert Garih:  My sisters were with m e.  Andm y sisters, you know, in 
‚
42 they were 9 and 
12. Sothey were going to school. T hey wer e going to the local school there. And I w
a s 
staying with the ladies.  I was only 4 years old.  I was staying with the ladies.  Ididn't go to 
school. I rem em ber the ladies, they were rais ing pigs and rabbits. Iwas f ascinated by these 
animals.  I was always watching them .  
 
 
And I was a very social little guy, you know 4
 
years old.  And I was talking to these 
ladies. At onepoint in the conversationI toldthem  that we were Jewish.  And that'sall it took 
these ladiesto send us right back to ourparents. That was som etim eduring the spring o
f 
1943.  Ok? W ehad to go back to our parents, to their apartm ent.
 
 
In September
 
1943, my f ather was summ oned toa slave labor camp in the Channel 
Islands. T he ChannelIslands, small islandsoff  the coastof  Norm andy.  My f ather was inthe 

c a m p.  T he y we
re building what was called the Atlantic wall. T hey were supposed to build 
bunkers to stopthe invasionf rom the allies. Som y f ather was sentto that camp. And m y 

m otherfound herself  alone with three young children, terrif ied at the idea that at any m
oment 
there couldbea knock at thedoor to takeusaway.

>> Bill Benson:  And just toemphasize thatpoint
, y
ou toldm efor your sisters, because they 
were older, andf or your m other, it was justa tim e of total terror because of the roundupsand 
your f ather's now gone.
 
>> Albert Garih: Exactly.  I was too young tobe af raid. I didn't realize that. I was old enough 

f rom  theage of 4f rom 1942 onwards,old enough to rem em ber everything but I was too young 
to realize and to be afraid.  I didn't have any nightm aresor anything like that.
 
 
My sisters and m y mother were terrif ied because they were aware of the danger.  It 
was a real danger. W e had som e people inour building who were taken 
away 
and were 
deported.  One of them  cam e back af ter thewar and he w
a s  lik e  a livin g s k e le t o n .
 
>> Bill Benson:  In one roundupalone,am I correct, thatas many as 17,000 French Jews were 
roundedup in one roundup alone?
 
>> Albert Garih:  13,000.  Yes, it was abig roundup. It was a stadium  where there 
were 

cyclin g ra ce s 
on thetrack. T he Germ ans had askedfor 20,000 men only. T hey wantedm en.  
And they round up 13,000 m en, wom en, children,elderly
 
people, ever ything.  So when the 
Chief  of Staff of the prime m inister asked theprim em inister whatare we going to do with 
the 

children and with all ofthese people
, s
end them  with theirfathers. 
 
 
So they roundedup intwo days
,  
16 and 17 of July
 
1942, they rounded up 13,000 
people which were parked inthe stadiumf orseveral days.  And you have to realize it was i n 
Ju ly.  It
 
was ver y
 
hot.  It was the summ er.  There was no such thing as air
-
conditioning or 
anything like that.  Even the toilets were ver y soonout of order andcould notbeused. T hese 

people were kept there.  They had whateverfoodthey had taken
 
--
 
because they didn't know 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
17
 
where they were going.  So they went out packing.  T hey were only allowed a small suitcase 
per person
,  
so they had am inim um  of food with them .  It was soonexhausted.  So they had no 
food, no water.  And itwas hot.  And they stayed there in
 
tha t 
f ilt h in t h a t s t ad iu m
 
f or several 
days.  I couldn'ttell you
 
--
 
it m ust have beenabout a week I som ething like that.
 
 
Eventually, they separated the menf rom thewom en and the children. T he women 
and children were sent to transit cam ps south of  Paris in two camps
, a
lso along the river.  After 
af ew days they were sent to another cam p and then toAuschwitz.  4,051, if I have the correct 

number, was sent to Auschwitz.  None of  them  cam e back. 
 
 
So m y parents had good reasons to be af raid and to be terrif ied.  That's when my 
father was takenaway.  My m other, one day shem etthis lady in them arket and som ehow, 
you know, they m ust have been talking. Thelady was com m iserating with my mother.  My 
m other started crying and said I'm  af raid thatat any m oment they can com eand take usawa y 
and take m y 
childrenawa y.  And this lady, M
adam
e  
Galop, went back hom e to her husband.  
In the evening she told what m y m other hadtold her. T he next day Mr.
 
Galop came with a 
cart.  In thosedays we  were pulling carts.
  
T here was no horses.
 
>> Bill Benson:  A wooden cart.
 
>> Albert Garih: A wooden cart. Justa strap, and he was pulling that. We took whatever 
personal effects we could take with us. Andwe went to live with the Galops. And we spent 
about six, seven months with them . That was tom e, the happiest tim eduring that som ber 
periodbecausethe Galops had two little girls, two daughters. I was 5.  It was in 
‚
43. I was 5.  
T hey had two daughters who were 4 and3. So I was playing.  
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
18
 
 
A n d  Mr.
 
Galop was a sc
ulptor
.  He was sculpting som e setsfor movie studios. And 
they had abig warehouse behind the housewhere they were storing all of these sets. And we 
had great hide and seek parties there, games, you know, with the two little girls.
  
Needless to 
s a y,  m y
 
m other, whenever there would be aknock at the door, shewould take us and I 
rem em ber that. She would takeus to the back room and say, 
ﬁ S h hh
, don't say a word.
ﬂ
  
A nd  
som ehow I learnedm y lesson.  Because I told the ladies in thatfarm  that I was Jewish.
  
That 
tim e I stayedputand didn't say a word.  But Irem em ber hearing som e voices inthe next room.
 
 
Actually, what Mr. Galop told us 
--
 
a great am ateur of art. At one point he visited the 
m ovie studios where Mr.
 
Galop was working.  W e were really in 
ha
rm™ s
 
wa y. W e were living 
less than a m ileaway f rom  theuniversity.  T here were big dorm s where the students whowere 

studying in Paris are staying.  And thathad beentaken over by theGerm ans. And therewere 
antiaircraf t, batteries, right on topof  the
 
r oof .
  
I remember at the endof  the war seeing a rocket 
thatm ust have been aV
-
1 or V
-
2, I don't know, that was lyin g on the groundthere. 
 
 
So we were ver y e xposed. W e were ina small street. It was about 10houses.  
Mostly artists, painters, sculptors,and peoplelike that.  And one of them , a painter, his wif e 

was a sym pathizer of  the Reich.  Andone day she told M
ad am e  Gal o p
 
--
 
though she likedm e.  
I remember Ihad conversations with her.  I was 
a  
kid, but apparently I spoke nicely f or 5 years 
old.
  
She said
 
--
 
she was always gi ving com plim ents tome.  Butone day she told 
M ad am e
 
Galop, 
ﬁW
henare yougoing to get rid of thatscum ?
ﬂ 
 
W e were the scum . 
 
S o a tth at tim e , 
Madam
e  
Galopandmy m otherdecided that it m ight be saferfor us to go back hom e, 
ac tu ally.   
And that's what we did.

>> Albert Garih: To our apartm ent. W e wentthere. It was in the spring of 1944.  It was close 
to  D
-
Day, actually.  Sure enough, just around D
-
Day, m aybe afew days bef ore,
 
a few days  
later
 
--
 
I cannot tell you exactly. We hada visi t of  two police inspectors.  Early in them orning, 
8:00. T hey alwa ys would com e in them iddle of  thenight or early in themorning.  8:00
 
in the 
m orning. A knock on the door. It was June
 
1944
.  
ﬁ
Ma d
am e 
Garih?
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
Ye s .
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
W e c am e  t o  
take you away.
ﬂ
  
 
 
I was sleeping.  I wasstill in m y bed.  It was8:00.  My m other wouldn't send me to 
school. My sisters had no choice. T hey were
 
--
 
at that tim ethey wer e 11 and 14. They had to 
go to school. Ok? I was not even6.  So m y m other would keepm e hom ebecause 

som etimes, you know, they would go to school, takethe children away, and the parents would 
never hear of them
 a
nym ore.
  
So m y motherwould rather keep m ehome at that tim e with her.  
So I was 
s t ill in  be d .  
 
 
I remember being awakened by the com motion
, t
hese two inspectors saying to m y 
m other thatthey cam eto take us away.  M y m other started shaking, of  course. They said:  

L
ook, we're going to report that we didn'tf indyou but youm ust not sleep in your apartm ent 
tonight
 b
ecause we are going to report that we didn'tf ind you but they are going to
 
--
 
m aybe 
they're going to send the Gestapoor the m ilitia, whatever.  And then these people if  they f ind 
you, they wil l take you away.
 
 
So you can imaginemy m other was com pletely desperate. W hat am  I going to do?  
Shedressed me very quickly. W e wentout. She wentto seea social worker that she knew.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

And sheexplainedthesituation. T he social worker said
:  L
ook, I'm  going to dom y best butI 
c
annotf ind a place
 
--
 
a hiding placef orall of you overnight. So inthe meantim e, try to seeif 
you can stay with your next doorneighbors.You m ust not go back to your apartm ent.
 
 
So that's what we did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your next door neighbor who takes you infor thatnight, like the Galops, 
they did this at great risk.  Right?
 
>> Albert Garih: Absolutely.  That was them ilitary.  It was a couple. They were Com m unists, 

m em be r
s 
of  the Communist party.  He had been summ onedby theGerm ans to go on 
m andatory labor servic e in Germ any.  And he had not shown up. So he was also wanted. For 

them  it was a great risk.  They had a little daughter who was m y age, a couple of months 
younger than m e. 
 
 
So they said you stay with us.  It was ver y convenient because they were working on 
n igh t sh if ts. M
onsieur 
Galop was an artist,making rod ironhappened rails.  Hem adetheone 
in Paris.  He was ver y proudof his work, actually.  And he was worki ng on that, that trade. 
And she was working i n a print shop, working at night where they were printing newspapers.  I 
don't know what they were printing.  But shewas in the night shif t.
  
So we would sleep in their 
bedduring the night. And in them orning when they would come backf rom  work, we would 

gi ve them the bedandthey would go to sleep.  So we stayed likethatf or af ew days.  
 
 
Andm y sisters, in the m eantim e,they stayed downstairs with the lodge
 
keeper
,  a 
wom an. Also the husband was not there. He m ust have been taken prisoner. Am other with 
three children,two boys and a girl.  They wer e about the sam eageas m y sister and I. T he

21
 
two boys were about 14 and 12. And the little girl was about5.  Madam e Papayon. She was 
the 
lodge keeper. My sisters were sleeping at the lodge keeper™s
 
apartm ent.  W e were 
s
leeping atthe neighbor's. T hat lastedfor afew days.  I couldn't tell you how m any days.
 
 
Eventually, the social worker cam e back tom y m other and said," I founda placef or 
eachone of you."  Som y m other was placed as a governess in afam ily near the 
Eiffe l T owe r, 

af am ily with eight or 10 children.  And we were placed ina Catholicboarding school, in a 
suburbeast of Paris called Mont
f
ermeil, which was m adef am ous by oneof  the" Les 
Mi s e
rables 
"  
--
 w
hen JeanValjeanm eets Cosette in the woods.W e were playing in these 
woods, actually.  And I rem em ber once that we had been takenoutto the woods. And there 
was an air raid. W eheard sirens blasting. W e had to runbackto the school.  Andthe next 
m orning we heard thatthere was abig crater in the clearing where we were.  W here we wer e 
playing, actually.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So we all sort of get thispicture
:  
here it is, June
 
1 944 ,  af t e r  D
-
Day.  T he allies 
have landed in France.  They're m arching into France.T heGermans are on the def ensive.  
And yet
 
they still are looking for Jews all over France andParis along with their French 
collaborators still hunting you down af ter D
-
Day as theend is com ing for them .
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes.  Yes.  They didn't stop. They were desperate to send as many Jews as 
they couldto their death, actually.  You know, altogether, objectively we have to acknowledge 
that France was not as bad as countries likePoland,for instance,or Hungary. W hen you think 
that in Hungary they managedtodeport 440,000 Jews in a matter of
 
months, two or three 
m onths,that's m indboggling.  Right?  T herewas Eichm ann, despite the efforts of Ra

W
all e nb

rg to save asm any Jews as he could.  But in France, somehow only 76,000 Jews 
were deported and lost their lives outof  a Jewish population of about 300,000. So about25%.  
B u t  it ' s  s t ill
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  76,000 people. 
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  76,000 people, yeah. So it was still bad. But there were good 
reasonsform y m other to be terrif ied. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Paris
 
--
 
af ter that, Paris is liberated in August
 
1944.As you said, you're6.  
You rem em ber when thathappened.  Right? Tell us about it. 
 
>> Albert Garih: I remember.  I was not in Paris when Paris was liberated, but I was in that 

subu
rb. W em ust have been liberated 
a  f e w 
days later because we were east. T he troops 
were m oving, the allies were m oving east.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you're inthe Catholic school still at thistim e.
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes. I was the baby.  I was6 years old at that tim e.  I was sort of the prodig
y 

of  the head m istress, I think. She was alwa ys  holdingm y hand.  She m ust have been the only 
one
, 
maybe with thepriest
,  
knew about me, that I was Jewish and Iwas in hiding.  Theother 
children didn't know.  I didn't say anything at that tim e. 
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  You learnedf rom that earlier experience. 
 
>> Albert Garih: I learned.  I learned.  I learned. That stayed with m efor many years af ter the 

war.  I was af raidto say that I was Jewish.
 
 
Paris was liberatedAugust
 
25,1944. My m other was on thef ront row.  She saw all 
thef ights in the streets betweenthe GermanArm y and the resistance.  Actually, Paris was

lib e r
ated by the French.  General Leclerc

the goal was in London at thattim e. He asked Eisenhower andBradley, he said
:  
I 
tookanoath and I said I was going to liberate Paris and Strasburg.  I don't know why Paris and 
S tr

, butthat was his goal to liberateParis and Strasb

and said please allow m

ivision to liberate Paris.  T hey rolled into Parison their 
tanks. A lot of peoplewere killed.  
 
 
In Paris youhave plaques allover, on the streets,onthe buildings. Here a youngm an 
by the ageof  24,22 was killed,f ighting the Germ ans.
 
 
So Paris was liberatedin August
 
24. You have to realize thatParis
 
--
 
when Paris was 
liberated, it was m ore or less exactly the time when Anne Frank in Holland was takenaway.  

She was arrested August
 
1944.  And shedied in March 1945 inBergen
-
Belsen, 
t wo  m on t hs  
bef ore the liberation of the camp and two months bef orethe end of the war.
  
So in a way we 
were pri vileged to beon thef ront row of  them ovementof  troops. W e were liberatedbefore. 
 
 
Oneday I was in the boarding school
 
--
 
whenever there was
 
analert, the sirens, we 
would go into the shelters.  It was underground in the school.  One of our hobbies, whenthe 
alert was over, was to go back to the playgroundand pick up someshrapnel.  Ihad a whole 
collectionof  shrapnel at hom ethat Ibroughthom e with m e whenm y m other cam e topick me 
up.
 
 
So when Paris was liberated afew days later, the train service was restored.  My 
m other,of  course, was on thef irsttrain. Shehas no way to comm unicate with us when she 
was working.  She was taking care of  eightor10 children in thatf am ily.  She had no news 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
24
 
about her children.  She knew where we were.  But she could not com municate with us. So 
thef irsttrain she was on the train.
 
 
Bef ore that, let me tell you about the liberation.  Oneof  the kids
 
--
 
this boarding 
school
 
--
 
in France we have two kinds of boarding schools. You have boarding schools f orrich 
kids where they were pam pered and they have the best education, like the private schools. 

And youhave the public schools where they keep children
 
who have been kicked out of public 
schoolbecause they were hopeless
.  S
o there were som e tough guys there.  Andone of them 
ran away one day.  And everybody was up inarm s because it was the war.  It was ver y 
dangerous. W e werewondering what happenedt
o him .  He cam e bac
k thenext m orning.  He 
said, "Theallies are com ing!  The allies are com ing!"  
 
 
W hetherhe was punished for having run away, I don't know.  But anywa y.  That's how 
we got the news that we were liberated.  So we all went on the 
m
ain 
s
tr
eet. And then we saw 
the jeeps, the tanks, the soldiers with the helm et which was not theGerm an helmet that was 
so  sca ry f o ru s.  
 
These people weref riendly. T hey had sm iles. They were gi vin g chewing 
gum , chocolate, even cigarettes.  Not to me but.
 
[L a
ughter]
 
T hey were gi ving ci gar ettes.  It was atotal
 
--
 
it was som ething newfor us.  
 
 
And I remem ber that it was 
the 
f irst time Iever heard of theAmericans.  I knew 
ever ything about the Germ ans, the Russians,the Italians, the English, the French. The
 

Am ericans? W here are thesepeoplef rom ?  I never heard of them .

>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  My mother was able

in the cam p, it was on the ChannelIslands. 
 
He  
was lucky not to be sent to a camp in theeast because if  he had been sent to Auschwitz o r 

oneof  these cam ps, chances arehe wouldnot have come back.  He was in a slave labor 
cam p.  He was building bunkers there.  
 
 
Actually, hehad an accident whenhe was there.  He was walking on a scaffolding.

was som e danger

also, the allies were doing ever ything they could tom ake believe the 
Germ ans, that the invasion would take place in the 
S
traits of  Dover, the sho
rtest distance 
between France andBritain.  So they were bom barding constantly there and destroying all of  
the fortif ications.
 
 
So at one pointthe Germ ansm oved
 
--
 
or evacuated the prisoners f rom  the island and 
sent them  to [Inaudible].  I rem ember because som ehow
 
--
 
I have no clueaboutm y father.  But 
I rememberm y m other at one point saying they were bombard
in g
 
and she was ver y nervo us 
about that.  Im ade the connection much later.
 
 
Anyway. W henthe Germ ans were retreating, at onepoint they putm y f at
her and 
other inmates with him ona trainboundf or Germ any. W hether they were going to sendthem  
to afactory to beusedas slave laborm aybe to adeath camp, Idon't know.  The train was 
traveling through Belgium , its northernBelgium ,actually, and the
 
train was stopped by Belgian 
Resistance whohad blown up the railroad track. T here was a battle.  Inthe confusion the 

Germ ans released their prisoners.  
 
 
T hat was som e tim earound August
 
1944.  My f ather walked backf rom northern 
Belgium  to Paris,abou
t  2 00
 
m iles.  It took him  a couple of weeks. He arrived home the 
m orning of Rosh Hashanah.  My m other was dressing m eupfor theoccasion. W e were going 

to synagoguef or thef irst tim e sincebefore the war.  Actually
, a
 
knock on thedoor in the 
m orning. 
 
My m other saw like a ghost, you know. W e were living at theend of a dark corridor.  
Shedidn't realize im mediately.  T hen when she realized that it was her husband who was 
there,but he was in bad shape
; y
ou know, he had suffered the injury onhis head

cliff plus thebad treatm ents in the slave labor cam p.  He was like aghost.  But he recovered.  
He was ver y strong.  IfI had been subm itted to the sam etreatm ent,I wouldn't have lasteda 
week.  Butm y father was stronger.
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
Inf act, just to jum pforward, late in his lif ehe was honored by the governm ent 
for longevity in his job. Right? 
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  My father workedf or43 years with the same em ployer
, w
it h  h is  
Jewish em ployer in that garm entf actory.  And he go
t a certif icate for that that was equivalent
 
--
 
andam edal that wasequivalent of  thehonor in France, 40 years of service.
 
>> Bill Benson:  If I rem em ber correctly, his death was broughtonby seizures that were 

probably related to his fall.
 
>> A l b e r t  G a
rih:  He died 50 years later. I strongly suspect that hisdeath was connected to his 
a ccid e nt off the  cliff .
  
Towards the end of  his
 
life, he would pass out.  He would b
e at the bus 
stopand all of a sudden he would f all, collapse.  Andpeoplehad topick
 
him  up.  He died 
of  
seizures.  He didn't have epilepsy, but it wasver y sim ilar seizures.  
 
 
W hen he died,actually, I didn't have a chance to seehim .  He wasbrain dead when I 
saw him .  I was calledby m y sisters, com e tosee yourf ather. I saw him .  He was brain dead.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the little bit of time we have lef t
t
wo other questions of  you.  One,of  course, 
as you mentioned earlier, you're liberated inAugust.  Yourfath
er's back in Septem ber or 
there
abouts. But thewar continued until May
 1
945.  How did your fam ily go about just sort of  
re
-
establishing som e sem blance of norm alcy?  And whendid they realize the extent of losses 
in your own extendedfam ily?

>> Albert Garih: W ell, m y m other had lost som e cousins who were takenaway, deported 
and 
sent to Auschwitz
 
wh
o didn't come back.
  
W hen we were liberated and we were back home, 
the wholefam ily, life resum ed alm ost imm ediately.  October
 
1 was back to school day.  I was 
eager.  I was 6 years old.  I was eager to go to schoolf orf irsttim e. 
 
I went to kindergarten 
occasionally, ver y occasionally becauseas Isaid m y mother was ve ry af raid to sendm ethere.  

So October
 
1, I was 6years old.  I was eager.  Im ust say that I was so eager thatI was a very 
good student.  At least in the f irst f ew
 
years. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did your parentsm anage tokind of pull their lives back together? Of  course, 

your f ather workedfor all of  those years.
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yeah.  W estill had som e restrictions atthat tim e.W e were having tickets to
 

buy food, everything was rationed.  It was rationed tickets.  It was ration ticketsf or bread,f or 
butter.  An egg was a luxur y item . Anegg.  Now we buy several dozens,dozen anda half , 
threedozens. At that tim e oneegg was a luxury item .  Yeah. W e had very little to eat.
 
 
One thing that happened

I'm a translator so I'm very sensiti ve to that.T here was a 
m istake by one French translator when placing an order. T hey wanted wheatf lourfor bread.  
T hey wanted to im portthat f rom the states. And inEnglish wheat iscorn.  Corn here is ma
is .
  
So they placed ahugeorderf or corn. Andf or about six m onths we had yellow bread. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In France, huh?
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes.  That I remember.
