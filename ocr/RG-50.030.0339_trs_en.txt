Q: Joseph, as we  begin talking about the period af
ter the liberation, I just want to ma ke sure 
that we covered everything that you wanted to before.  
 
A: There was one episode that I meant to cite a
nd I will do it now.  In those fi rst fe w days of 
September of 1942, whe n the ma ss deportation st
arted, my mother had been taken away.  
My father and my sister had to leave our
 dwelling because the Germans who were 
shrinking and shrinking the size of
 the Ghetto.  It was hot.  
It was summer and there was 
no roof over their head anymore so we lived in
 the street for about 
three days and three 
nights on the paveme nt.  When I finally obtaine
d my father's permission to leave him for 
a few mi nutes because  I wanted to look up my
 buddies from the resistance moveme nt , 

some thing which he opposed for two or three hours, because he didn't want to lose sight 
of me  in case we don't fi nd each other again 
or  that one of us will be swept up by yet 
another Razzia.  I, walking down the street, I 
ran into one of the two fellows who a year 
and a half before recruited me  for the resist
ance move me nt Hashomer Hatzair.  This was 
Richard, we called him Rishak.  He had the l
ook of an insane pers
on rushing about, and I 
asked him well where are the leaders and wher
e is our cell and he finally gave me  an 
address where I could find our comp any comma nder, a girl about 17.  The word being 
Gdud, and when I asked him where Simon was, 
the taller of us three who also with him 
recruited me  into the resistance moveme nt, he to
ld me  that several days before the two of 
them were caught by the curfew.  They had ma na ged to work their way homesby a few 

mi nutes.  The streets were deserted.  The puni
shme nt for violating 
the curfew was oft e n

instant execution in the street . 
 So, the two of them darted into a store front and were flat 
against the wall when the German gendarme 
went by.  German gendarme, who paroled 
the Ghetto most of the time  in addition to 
the SS who used to come  in for forays, for 
selection, but ma inly after 9:
00 in the evening it was the 
gendarme s, you mi
ght call it the 
military policemen.  They discovere d them and as Richie had time  to tell me  in those fe w 
words with the commotion in the st reet a
nd throngs of hundreds of people milling about 
not knowing where to go what to do with them
selves, waiting yet another selection.  He  
said when the German ge ndarme approached them and asked them what they were doing 

in German, the gendarme turned to the taller
 Si mon who was always the more comba tive 
one, the more bellicose one of us three.  He always felt that when the time  come s, the 

sooner the better that we should fight with what
ever we had at our disposal.  The German 
gendarme turned to him and called him "D
u verfluchter Juedischer Schwein_, which 
means you Godda mn Jewish pig.  Richard said
 Simon shot back and said you Goddamn 
German pig, at which point the gendarme  shot
 him between the eyes.  That's  how we lost 
our closest friend, and at that point Ri chard, 
with his half insane 
look on hi s face said I 
got to go.  I got to look for my father.  I don'
t know where my  father is.  So, I went back 
to join my father and my sister  in the street.  
 

Q: Let me  ask you one question.  The years af
ter that when hiding 
you were a catholic boy 
when you converted, did you have any informa
tion or contact with
 Jewish people?   
 

A: Since I jump ed out of the train on the way to
 Treblinka in the first few days of Septembe r 
of '42, other than sneak
ing into two more Ghettos, in 
the provincial small towns, which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339

lasted a few weeks before the deportations
 there started also. 
 Once I was on my own 
again, and later with the priest and working 
for the Polish peasants, as of Nove mber '43 
going to east Prussia with new Polish documen
ts and Polish catholic until the end of the 
war, I had absolutely no contact with the Jewish people.  I ha d no idea what became of 
them except that common talk had it that they 
were all either having 
been exterminated or 
they'r e in the concentration camps, and that 
there is a countrywide hunt for the Jews.  I 
did not know about the crematoria obviously 
at that point, but I had the foreboding based 
on tidbits that they'r e either all extermin
ated  or about to be exterminated.  
 

Q: What about   

 

A: There was no time to stop and think and delib
erate as to what it f
eels like.  The entire 
focus second by second, mi nute by mi nute, day 
by day was on self preservation and that 
meant watching my facial expressions, my 
13:08:13  gesticulations, my "true story" 
where I came from, my i dentity obviously ch
anged as to my background, my schooling, 
who my parents were, wa tching my speech.  B
ecause one could give one self away with 
one word.  Even though we were quite Polani
zed, comi ng from a certain environment one 
accrues a lexicon of words that one doesn'
t even think about.  Whether one be an 
Irishma n or a Jew or an Italian, every now and then you use a certain word which under 

normal circumstances it is accepted and is part of
 the mosaic of life especially when there 
are some mi norities in the c
ountry.  You don't think of that
, but when you try to play 
another role as it were and pose for some one el
se, one could give one's self away with a 
word.  I'll never forget by the time  I gotto East Prussia and my German was already 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
4 
 
so-so because of exposure and because of 
my childhood where my father taught me  a 
little bit German and I was speaking German pas sably and I'll never forget when I spoke 
to a German and I used the word for bread 
Broit.  Broit is the 
Yiddish, Brot is the 
German.  Well, inadvertently trying to acquire
 as much Ger man as I coul d in order to 
speak to the Germans, I used that word Bro
it and the German looked at me  and corrected 
me  and said it's not Broit, it's Brot.  And I 
said yes, of course, but I almos t  collapsed 

within me because I felt that 
I would give myself away with
 that one word.  Fortunately 
the German was not aware of that, but one ha
d to be on a constant alert every second of 
the day first speaking to the 
Polish population for whom out in the country I was the 
"educated city boy."  So, when they comm
ented how good my  Polish is, we ll he's from 
the city.  But also with the priest , Father 
Farkowski we had a number of sessions where 
he would pluck out a word from my daily 13:
12:  lingo and then coach me not to use this 
word, not to use that word, and taught me  a new me lody of s peech.  In other words, a 
pygma leon, he was rema king me  right down to how to hold my lips toge ther because he  
felt that Jews by and large were more sens
uous people and their lip
s were by and large 
thicker.  Many Poles so he felt had a thinner line of lips, so then he coached me  that when 

I'm not actually speaking to hold my  lips together
 like this.  In order to project a thinner 
lip line.  So, I was -- ever si
nce those days when he starte
d rema king my i dentity as it 
were, for years and years after the war as I s
ee it now, I have been gr
oomed to play a role, 
and that lasted for years and years after 
the war, until not too long ago, ma ybe ten or 

fifteen years ago when I began to search for what is my own s e lf.

Q: I want to get to that a little bit later.  
Let's pick up from when you were liberated.  If you 
can reme mb er that for me.  
 
A: Well, the day after the liberation by the Amer
ican troops and this was Patton's third army 
in Erfurt, Thuringen, which I was liberated th
e day after President Roosevelt di ed, which 

I believe was April 13, 1945.  A couple of the 
Polish fellows with whom I lived courtesy 
of my boss, where he found a small room for fi
ve, six of us Polish civilian workers so we 
would not have to stay in a labor camp.  One of
 the two Polish fe llows sa id to me to go to 
the ma in railroad station, Erfurt, because that
's where there were a lot of Americans.  So, 
we walked over there ma ybe a half an hour or
 so, and there across the street from the 
main railroad station in Erfurt, ther e were a lo
t of G.I.s.  In front 
of the hotel across the 
street from the station there was a lot ofmove me nt of G.I.s so obviously it's hard to 

describe how it felt.  A  mi xture of enthusiasm
 that one actually not fully believed yet that 
this was liberation, but it must have been 
because there were Am
erican soldiers all 
around.  It wa s warm and ma ny of the soldiers were in a very friendly mood so I trying to 

invoke my English of which I had had two 
years in the underground high school courses 
in the Wa rsaw Ghetto, and I knew a fair amount of English because I liked the language 

from the beginning more so than French a
nd I started conversing 
with the American 
soldiers.  One word led to the other and they gi
ve us as usually after liberation -- skip it.  
They give us chocolate and ciga
rettes and things of that nature
 and we were very grateful 
and they said to come  back in the evening and 
they'll have some thing mo re for us to eat.  
When I went back there the second day, one 
of the soldiers introduced me  to a first 
lieutenant Preston.  That lieutenant asked me , 
he looked like by the way one of the British 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339

stars, David Niven, with the moustache, slim, 
tall very presentable,
 asked me whether I 
knew Ger man.  I said Ye s, I do.  Do I know Polish, yes of course, I'm Polish, I know 
some  Russian.  He said come  on in and help us interpret because they've had a number of 

refugees and foreign nationals and also
 Germans whom they were interrogating 
apparently.  So, I studied inte
rpreting.  I was then 17, for the American G.I.s.  He asked 
me  to come  back the next day and after some  
two or three days, they gave me  a shirt and 
the trousers of a G.I. unifor m without an insigni
a so that within three or four days after 
the liberation I was already dressed as an Amer
ican soldier.  My job there was ostensibly 
as an interpreter and 
all around helper.  I suppose some  pe
ople call guys like me  in those 
days a ma scot or just a kid who fell in with
 the American troops.  Within about a week 
later after I helped interpret for a huge num
ber of displaced pe rsons, Poles, Ukrainians, 
Russians, goodness knows who else who woul
d stop by that hotel simply because the 
Americans were ther e.  Help me with this
 and help me  with that.  It was a whole 
move me nt of nations.  Occasiona lly, they 
would bring in Germans and as  I found out 

later some got pretty rough treatment.  Th
ey were moving out.  This American unit and 
they asked me  if I wanted to go with them
.  We ll, you mi ght as well of put me  on the 
moon of my dreams because of c
ourse I would want to go with them.  By that time  I was 
eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the wa r time  diet.  

There was candy and ciga rettes and everythi ng 
else.  It wasn't until a few weeks later 
when my English started getti
ng better and so on that I found 
out what that unit what.  To 
me  they were just American soldiers.  They 
were CIC.  Counter Intelligence Corp of the 
United States Army, and as it turned out this
 was detachme nt 220 of the 20th Corp which 
was part of the 3rd Army , Patton's.  So, I travel
ed with that unit.  There were at the most 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
7 
 
ten of them in that detachme nt headed by 
Major Lobb who I was told by one of the CIC 
me n a New Yorker or a Jewish fellow said 
that son of a gun, he was the judge who once 
found me guilty when I had a traffic ticket in
 New York.  Major Loeb who was a prince 
of a fellow in contrast with one of his lieuten
ants who within I woul
d say two weeks or so 
ma de approaches to me , homosexual approach
es that I frankly didn't know how to cope 
with.  In the best English I could offer him 
when he came into my room in the evening, 
because wherever we went they comma ndeer
ed the German hotel, I told him I was a 
catholic and as best as I could that we don'
t do things like these.  Because up until that 
time I had never had any sexual encounter at 
age 17 since during the war in East Prussia 
at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or 
women to be with.  A foreign national, Pole 
or any other non-German was under severe pe
nalty to have any intimate relationships 
with a German girl, which was unthinkable.  Some who had and found a German girl I 

suppose consenting were taken to concentrati
on camp or severely beaten by the Gestapo.  
That was to preserve  the purity of the Ge
rman race.  So, I had had absolutely no 
experience with a man or a woman.  Within 
a few days after I was liberated and I was 
with these American G.I.s in a hotel 13:22:30 
 where they were stationed.  One of the m 
asked me  if I could play piano and I said yes 
a little bit and I sat 
down to play piano.  I 
had short pants.  It was April and he sidled 
up to me  and he put his hand inside my pants 
and started fondling me  as I was playing pia
no.  This was a few da
ys after liberation.  
That was before I found out that they were CIC.
  To me they were just normal American 
soldiers.  Within a couple of 
weeks two of the m had ma de advances to me .  That was part 
of my exposure to my great liberators and 
it wasn't  until years, years later when I had 
gone to Yale and acquired a littl
e bit more street wisdom and 
exposure to the world that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339

learned that  as the sayi ng goes the intelligen
ce community not to me ntion the diplomatic 
community is disportionately staffed by homo
sexuals.  My experience in the American 
counter intelligence, that's  the people who 
liberated me  within two weeks two of the m 
had ma de advances vis-a-vis me  and I was 17. 
 As we drove with my liberators -- and the 
advances stopped by the way soon enough because
 I had made it clear that I didn't want 
them.  The CIC detachme nt followed the fr
ont line troops throughout Bavaria and into 
Austria almost to reach Linz.  As soon as th
e American troops occupied a city, the CI C 
was there within hours and some ti mes even ah
ead of them.  Once we were caught in the 
cross fire because we had ma rchi
ng orders to reach the next city
 and it turned out that that 
had not yet been freed by front line troops.  Wh
e r ever we reached the city and it went - - 
we had 13:25:  gone through Augsburg and a numb
er of southern German cities and into 
Austria, and I reme mber we were stationed 
for a while in Ried, in Innkreis me aning the 
district of Inn and the town was Reid.  As soon as we reached the town that was liberated, 
we had four or five jeeps and in teams of 
two we had addresses to pluck out the Nazis 
who had been on the list.  So, this was basically
 the job of the CIC, that was to arrest the 
more promi nent Nazis, and I interpreted when 
I could.  I have not seen any bad treatment 
except one that who was detached from th
e first French army, a native Alsatian 
Frenchma n who despised the Germans and when
ever he was interroga
ting them he beat 
them up very badly.  Since I didn't have to interp
ret I never wanted to be
 part of that but I 
would hear from another room and he  would 
break chairs over their heads and so on and 
a number of the Hitler Jugend or the SS me n 
caught were beaten up pretty badly when 
they didn't want to answer questions.  
Eventually, by the time  that our unit was 
commandeered back into Germany from Aust
ria, the CIC unit I believe wa s being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
9 
 
transferred or sent home so that I was taken by 
one of the officers to an MP unit, Military 
Police, and that was in Augsburg, Germany, w
ith the recommendation that the MPs could 
use an interpreter.  By that 
time , my English became  14:02:  
 more proficient.  I was with 
that unit of the MPs being houses and fed and of
 course living with them and having a GI 
uniform without insignia, for ma ny weeks. 
 This was when I gradually emboldened by 
my liberation began to confide 
in one or two soldiers abou
t my true background.  That I 
was Polish but I was also Jewish.  Although 
by and large the GIs and MPs with whom I 
was living and working were a ma gnificent 
lot of young people.  They were mostly 
draftees.  They couldn't wait to count their poi
nt s to be repatriated 
and to be released 
from the army.  To them I was a kid, 17 and Po
lish and anxious to help them and grateful.  
They treated me  ma gnificently.  But, as the wo
rd got out that I was 
also Jewish, I started 
experiencing a few incidents of anti- semitism.  
 
Q: It was a noticeable change?  
 

A: Significantly, I reme mb er standing in line fo
r chow, the 14:04:  army me al, in Augsburg 
where we were quartered.  One MP sergeant with whom I only had a passing 

acquaintance was in the line ne
arby and he started calling me  the Jew boy.  As it turned 
out he was of Polish ethnic background from Chi cago.  Then, a time came  soon after 

when I was ordered to undergo house arrest.  The lieutenant De mpsey I reme mber his 

name  a strapping, huge giant of a ma n from Kent ucky who behaved towards me  like an 

older brother with no hint of homos e xuality 
whatsoever, always protected me  and liked 
me.  He told me that the major of the MP
s, the provost ma rshall of that division, didn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
10 
 
like Jews and ordered me  house arrest for me
.  Lieutenant Dempsey the southerner who 
loathed negroes, blacks, so much so t hat
 whenever I went out on the inspection tou 
throughout the city, as an MP, an officer of the MPs, he was checking IDs and whether 
they had a pass, and whenever he me t up 
with black soldiers, he treated them 
abominably,someti mes would lock them up.  I 
a s ked him why he would he do that and he 
said because I hate the blacks because  they
 are garbage and they
 are the scum of 
huma nity, and I said but Lieutenant, as much 
as I was able to express myself, but isn't 
America for all?   This was my drea m of Am
erica, equality, justic
e from outside looking 
in.  He said, yes, except for the blacks.  A
nd strangely enough, this was an MP lieutenant 
who was ma gnificent toward me  eve n though he 
already began to find out that I was of 
Jewish background.  But his superior officer, Ma
jor, also from the deep south, hated the 
Jews, and after a while, when Lieutenant Demps e y come  sneaking into my room and 

bringing me something to eat, and I even n
eeded permission to go the bathroom, because 
the ma jor the provost ma rshall put me  in a hous
e arrest for as long as he would deliberate 
what to do with me  next.  
 
Q: What was the basis for house arrest?  

 

A: That he didn't  want a Jew boy to be an interpreter any more and he was trying to ma ke up 
his mi nd what to do with me  next, and Lieute
nant De mpsy would come  in an sharing his 
outrage but saying this was his 
superior officer.  I can't  14:
07:30  do anything about.  And 
strangely enough, a ma n who became a friend of mi
ne for yea r s later in the United States, 
an attorney in Wa tertown, Massachusetts, an
 Irish ma n, John Corbot, who befriended me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
11 
 
also because he was one of the MPs.  St
rangely enough, he looked 
me  up later when I 
was in the hospital and would bring me  thi
ngs to the hospital and when I came to the 
United States we became friends for years to
 come.  So, that's  another face of an 
American soldier.  But, I never lost  faith 
in the ideals of America and I wanted to go 
there, although I have already 
seen some of the shady sides 
of the face of the American 
people as exemplified by some  of the soldie
rs.  Meaning, some  homosexuals, some  Jew 
hating soldiers, and eventually
 I was taken to a DP ca mp in Augsburg which was a Polish 
displaced persons camp.  
 
Q: Let me  interrupt you for a second.  How 
you experienced this, did it ma ke you question 
whether you should rema in cathol
ic or admit your Judaism?   
 

A: So, when I got to the DP camp in Augsbur
g, at the time when the population of the camp 
had to be registered, mo st had 
lost their i.d. cards and whatev
er.  I then had a talk with 
myself because there was no one I could trus
t or knew what name  I should use.  My 
official name was then Kutrzeba, which was the assume d na me  under which I got the 

Polish identity card under the German occupatio
n.  When the time came to regist er at the 
Polish DP camp, I was wavering what name  I should use and despite the couple of 

incident s of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I 

was interpreting because of the ma jor and one 
of the sargeants were anti-semites, I still 
felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I.
s that I me t were just great and friendly 

people, and I felt that I should re
vert back to my original na
me .  Pride in my fa mily and 
my background, so I had given the name  Fajwiszy
s, the original family name , but as the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
12 
 
weeks went by into August, September of 1945 a
nd as I lived in the DP camp with one of 
the American MPs, the one who became  a 
friend of mi ne, stopping by occasionally and 
bringing me  cigarettes and candy and all that
, I began to experience ma nifestations of 
anti-semitism a mong my fellow Poles.  It seems that whenever they talked about Jews it 
was denigrating and Jew boys and I 
wish they got rid of all of 
them and worse.  So, here I 
was 14:11:30  in a DP camp with Polish popul
ation listening to a lot of anti-semitic 
comments, time and again, with most of them or a ll of them not knowing that I was also 

Jewish.  This is no time  and place, and I'm not
 a historian in order to make a case wher e 
there was anti-semitism i n almost any countr
y, including the United States, and there was 
some anti-semitism in Poland before the war, 
and the fact that there was six years of 
constant  barrage on the average uneducated 
Pole by the German occupying authorities 
ridiculing Jews showing in th
e press caricatures of the Je
w with the hook nose who is out 
to rob everybody and cheat everybody and for a 
case can be ma de, but this is no time and 
place for me to raise that.  The fact is is that I bega n to experience almost daily 

anti-semitic conversations.  That didn't  ma
ke it easy, and when I was asked about the 
origin of the name  of Fajwiszys which to
 those who know origin of name s, mi ght 

recognize that it is a Jewish name , I would sa
y that it was a Lithuani an name , because a 
great ma ny of Lithuanian name s end is i-s.  S
o, I said yes, it's an old family name from 
Lithuania.  Then, when word reached me  th
at a Polish gymnasium was being formed in 
Munich that one could go on with one's  studi
es, I got permission to leave that camp and 
repaired to Munich where I was accepted
 into the gymnasium.  There was a Polish 

gymnasium also in the DP camp specifically 
in the for mer SS Kaserne outside of Munich 

where very large Polish dp camp had been 
forme d.  The Jews had another camp a fe w 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
13 
 
miles away and I had nothing to do with 
that and I have no reason to look up anybody 
because I was convinced that everybody I knew 
had perished.  As I was exposed to some  
anti-semitism in the American army and in the DP camp I reached the conclusion by 
myself that the persecution is going to start ove
r again.  It's just a matter of time.  I could 
not imagine that a country that was known to
 be the most civilized in Europe, Germa ny, 
at least 14:15  by some , la
unching a genocide with the w
hole world standing by without 
that it would start all over again.  It was ju
st a matter of time, and I didn't want to go 
through this again, now that I had obtained th
rough some  very difficult rambulations.  My 
new identity I thought I would s
tick with it except 
in the way that my mi nd for med itself 
then, by then almost age 18, I felt that I should
 be proud of my original fa mily name  and 
some how fake the answers to the origination 
of the name .  In the DP camp in Munich, I 
eventually gr aduated from the Lyceum in 1947 an accelerated course with excellent 

ma rks, and the question was what's next.  I st
ill bore my original name Fajwiszys.  But 
when I got to -- I'm going to start with some thing else now.  
 

Q: I just want to ask you a questi
on.  I just want to a little bit 
about the conditions or the life 
in the DP camp.  
 

A: The DP camp in Munich was the former SS 
barracks but barracks is not quite appropriate 
because Kaserne actually means a center, a military center.  This was permanent brick 

houses with long halls and large rooms where 
there were double bunks.  Life was fairly 
mi serable meaning extremely ski mpy food ra
tions, watery soup, barely enough to sustain 

a person.  As children meaning high school st
udents, we would supposedly get a little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339

more, but I was convinced that there was so
 muc h corruption and stealing including the 
organs the international organs that we
re channelling the food to us, which was 
prominently UNRRA, United Nations Relief a
nd Rehabilitation Agency.  I reme mber 
when I broke my front tooth so that I was t
oothless in the front for about two or three 
years on crackers sent to us supposedly by Am
erican donors to the dps that were so hard 
they were almost imposs i ble to bite.  That's
 how I cracked one tooth.  It was always a 
struggle for food.  Eventually UNRRA was tu
rned 14:19:  into IRO, International 
Refugee Organization, but all th
e scuttlebutt and all the a
ppearances we heard and saw 
was that there was an enormous corruption, 
an enormous black ma rket of food supplies 
collected from ma ny countries of the world, including I'm sure a great ma ny well 

meaning people in the United States with a gr
eat deal of it being 
stolen or ending up on 
the black ma rket and some  of the officials gett
ing very rich in the process.  About a year 
after I entered the gymna sium in Munich th
e entire high school w
ith our teachers was 
sent to a punishment camp by 
the American authorities.  By 1946, the Soviets were 
exerting great political pressure to repatriate
 all displaced persons.  Many of us Polish 
Nationals hearing that things
 were very unsettled in Poland didn't  want to go yet, 
including the Polish forces who fought w
ith the Allies at Tobruk, Monte Cassino and 
those who helped liberated Holland and Belgium and the Polish air force fighting for the 

battle of Britain.  Eschewal repa triation becau
se of word that the Soviets were entrenched 
with the Apparatchiks and so on, so that ma
ny of us didn't want to go back there until 

there was an assurance of 
free elections in Poland which as we know had not 
materialized.  The pressure
 on the refugee organizations and the American zone 
authorities was so strong by the Soviets that 
there was a constant pr
opaganda to return to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
15 
 
one's home  country, Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Ukraine, Russia, what have you.  The high 
school with our teachers was considered the 
hot bed of patriotism and nationalism simply 
because we were the more educated by comp
arison with the average uneducated inmate 
of the displaced person's camp, and because 
the school in ____?? ______as a unit refused 
to be repatriated together with our profe
ssors who were prewar Polish teachers who 
found thems e lves in one way or another in Ge
rmany after the war, we were sent to a 
punishme nt camp in a place called Altenstadt ne ar Garmisch Partenki rchen, wooden 
barracks.  As it turned out, very cold and ha
rdly heated in winter 
in order to break our 
spirit so that we would go to Poland, help 
solve the refugee probl
em for the American 
authorities and diplomatically help the We
stern allies who had millions of refugees on 
their hands in Germany further pr essured by the Germans themselves who were telling 

them how ca n we rebuild our country with millions of refugees who don't  want to go 

home.  Wha t 's going to become of t hem.  
America and Australia and Canada and New 
Zealand, playing the waiting game , hoping that
 we all would go back home that they 

wouldn't have to admit us as emigrants.  Th
is waiting game  went on in my case for five 
years.  But in Altenstadt when we were 
herded on a train, we Refugees, displaced 

persons, me mbers of the nations which fought 
on the Allied side in Germany, we were 
now being sent to a punishment camp because we  refused repatriation under the 

communist regime .  On t he way to Altens
tadt, we were stopped and searched by the 
American constabulary who was evoking in us an
 echo of being transported by the Nazis.  
Here we are a bunch of helpless civilians, Po
lish Nationals including mostly students of 
high school age with their prof
essors guarded by the American
 constabulary which was a 
form of military police.  So
me  of the MP units on occupa
tion Germany ca lled themselves

constabulary.  At one point, a train wa s stoppe
d.  It was warm summer, every one of us 
refugees of Nazis was searched by the Amer
ican constabulary and anything that was 
found in our possession fork, knife, old spoon for which we had no receipts of purchase 

was thrown on a heap and taken away from us.  These were the measures employed by a 

combination of refugee author
ities, the American consta
bulary and as we found out 
nearby a detachme nt of CIC where the head of
 it was a communist, an American officer.  
He also tried to force what he thought Polish na tionalist to go back to Poland, because he 

ma y have be en under orders to solve the re
fugee problem.  Now, if you think of the 

ignominy of asking refugees to produce a re
ceipt that we had purchased it during and 
after the war where one simply grabbed a fork 14:26:  and a knife whenever one could, 
but here the American constabulary penalizi
ng us refugees, us Allies to pr oduce what 
would be under normal conditions in America.
  If you have some thing, produce a receipt 
of purchase.  It was an unforgettabl e e
xperience to me  and the shady side of the 
American occupation that one had liberate
d me  a nd on the other hand showed me  the 
ugly side of America.  Still in 
all, my  faith in the United Stat es never falter ed because I 
felt that these were only people and the c
ountry as such is built upon Jeffersonian 
principles and liberty and just
ice for all and so on. And then
 as I prepared to enter the 
University of Munich as a pauper student 
after graduation, the f
ood was scandalous, the 
little rations by that time.  I had joined the 
Polish student home in Munich and our entire 
support was a carton of cigarettes sent by th
e Polish exile government in London to us, 
one carton a month.  That was the entire s
upport.  So, those of us who s moke had the 
excruciating choice, to smoke half and sell 
the other half on the black ma rket where you 
buy some  food.  By that time I applied and join
ed the Polish forces which were assisting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339

the American army and occupation.  Polish 
forces put together from ex POWs  and 
refugees and all kinds of young me n who had 
been me mbers of the Polish Ar me d forces 
before the wa r.  There we re all together 
I believe 60,000 of them in the American and 
British Zones of Occupation.  All wore the Am
erican or British uniforms with Poland on 
the shoulde r until the cold war started in '
48 and the Soviets were launchi ng propaganda 
that the Americans and the Brit
ish are cultivating Polish forces
 to liberate Poland.  End of

A: So, when I started attendi
ng the university of Munich on 
food rations that one can only 
imagine, no money no tuition to be sure, I have 
fr iends in New York to this day there are 
three of them that are my buddies, Polish student
s and to this day shar
e a great friendship.  
We would share a slice of bread and a potato.  Th
is is '47 and '48, two years after the war.  
We were almost completely destitute, no s
ource of income , no way to earn the money 
and no place to go except starting to attend lect
ures because  every one of us wanted to 
ma ke some  t hing of ourselves.  I then deci
ded that in order to survive and get some  

decent food I would join the Polish forces.  O
fficially they became to be known as Polish 
guard, but we  where in the service of the American army not arme d because the sovi ets 

launched a huge propaganda that we were out 
to liberate Poland that the Americans and 
the British were cultivating this force in 
order to ma rch on Poland 
but we were guarding 
American depots and performi ng a s e mi  poli
ce duty for the American army.  By that 
time, it was very difficult to get in on that force because there were three square meals a 

day and lodging and so on.  Still, I resolved
 that I would try a
nd what happened was a 
quirk of fate.  When I appeared before the 
company commander who as it turned out was 
the prewar Polish army professional wa
rrant officer called ______________, in Polish.  
But I had been sufficiently exposed to anti-s
emitic mo ments that I resolved at the first 
opportunity I would have I would revert back to my assume d name , Polish name  

Kutrzeba, but how to do it.  The best way to 
do it when I was about to join that Polish 
force even though I continued to study at th
e university whenever
 I could, attended 
lectures, and that 15:04:  was the time  to
 obtain a new identity under my old name .  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
19 
 
appeared before the company commander and 
had a long interview.  I showed him my 
graduation papers from the Polish gymnasium, 
but I told him my real
 name  was Kutrzeba 
and this is how I wanted to be known from
 now on.  He asked me  why a nd I had to 
concoct a new story in order to as by that 
time I pledged to myself remain Polish and 
catholic and ma ke an absolutely clean br
eak with Jews, and eventually hoping to 
immi grate to America into yet another lions de
n and I say it advisedly just as went into 
East Prussia with fake Polish documents hoping 
that in Germany I would be less apt to be 
found out a Jew than by fellow Polish nationals. 
 This time I felt I would go to America 
as a Polish catholic and as long as I keep 
away from certain people, nobody would care, 
nobody would even bothe r because I had been to
ld that in American as long as you do 
your job well, nobody cares who you are.  We ll, we'll get to that.  So, when I appeared 
15:06:  before the captain and told him that Fajwiszys was a na me  that I took on because 
I didn't want to go back to Poland in the even
t that I was forced to go under my original 
name  Kutrzeba.  The name  Kutrzeba has pr
oduced two fa mo us persons in Poland.  One 
was a revered history professor at the Jagelo
nian University in Krakow well known to all 
the academi cs and the other was General Kutrzeb
a after which my father name d me .  He 
asked me whether I was related, the captain that
 is, to General Kutrzeba, and I said no not 
really.  Within one week I was accepted to enro
ll and I started within weeks as a corporal, 
later went to a sergeant and eventually b
ecame a second lieutenant with my main duties 
being teaching English to Polish troops as mo
st of them were hoping to emigrate to an 
English speaking country, America, Canada, Australia, what have you.  But I also 

performe d the duties of the officer of the day 
every sixth day or so.  It wa s months later 
that I found out from one of the me mbers of 
that company that Capt
ain Voiski told him 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
20 
 
that he knew General Kutrzeba, that I looked like him.  He wa s c
onvinced that I was his 
son except that I was denying it preferring not 
to ask for extra favors and that was the 
reason that he hired me  even though it was 
extremely difficult to 
be hired since the 
American Army put a quota on how ma ny could be
 hired.  So, then I spent two years as 
an officer for the Polish guard force working 
directly for the American Army and in the 
end we received preferential treatme nt for im
mi gr ation to the U.S. as we served the 
American army.  
 
Q: Can I ask a question.  In all this time, di
d you feel alone, without family?   Did you think 
about that?   
 

A: Being alone and lonely became a fixture, so
rt of like a lamp 15:09:  or the sky or a 
hurricane.  At times an excruciating experi
ence, a tortuous experience, worse yet because 
you have no one to confide in, no one to consult.
  I have ma de errors
 that in retrospect 
that if I had a kindly older pers
on to consult or advise me  le
t alone having the kinship and 
the warmth of the fa mily.  Now, I was alone. 
 I was fr iendly with a few of the soldiers 

there.  I became  friendly with two or thr
ee of my fellow Polish students, but strangely 
enough, at the Polish student home in Munich, no
 one spoke of his war time  experiences, 

and we were so touchy and respectful of one 
another that no one asked the other -- well, 
we mi ght ask where you're from originally -- no one asked how did you survive, and I'm 

talking about non-Jews.  Some  Po
les were taken into labor camp
s.  Some participated in 
the Wa rsaw uprising, taken prisoner.  It wa
s almost an unspoken concordat where no one 
spoke of his war time experiences.  You don't ha
ve to be Jewish to suppress the tortuous 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
21 
 
and tragic events in your life if
 they are so close to you as we
 learned as we got older, 30, 
40, 50 years later.  It took that ma ny years fo
r some  people to start 
confronting the torture 
of the war time  experiences.  At that time,
 '48, '49, '50, in Munich, the emphasis and the 
focus was on surviving.  What's tomorrow.  Wha t  am I going to do tomorrow and as we 
and some  of my fellow students whose age ra
nge from -- I was the youngest.  The rest of 
them were prewar students whose studies 
were either  interrupted by war in the POW 
camps or what have you and some were 26 a
nd 30 years old.  So, I was the youngest, and 
our ma in foc us after all being young and not 
being able to help ourselves and some  
whose fa milies they had not heard fro m or 
who were also executed.  Poland also had 
three million citizens executed in addition to 
three million Polish Jews.  Our main fo cus 
was on what are we going to eat tomorrow 
and smoke and where are we going to find 
young girls to sleep with in addition to studying. 
 That was the ma in focus.  I in addition 

who had no fa mily left, no one of my original
 background left , and I then began to play 
my role to the fullest of Polish catholic.  
 

Q: Did you enjoy yourself at all. 
 Did you start a 
social life?   
 

A: Oh, sure, ma ny times "you enjoyed yourself," 
especially when I star
ted receiving income  
from serving in the Polish guard and still ma intaining a tiny room in the student home.  

Of course I went to lectures. Of course 
I milled around with the Germans, but never got 
close to a single German.  I reme mb er one or
 two students took a liki
ng to me  and wanted 
to find out more about me , and 
wanted to invite me  home to
 dinner and I turned it down.  
I didn't want to have anything to do with 
the Germans, although there was no other place 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
22 
 
to study except at a German university.  We  
were given preferential treatment, I me a n 
displaced persons.  The average young German 
had to perform physical labor for a year 
or two or three to clear rubbles and ruins of
 the bo mbed city until hi s turn came to attend 
a university, because millions of Germans who 
had not been killed in the war came back 
and they all wanted to study.  We  displaced 
15:14:  persons, as long as our credentials 
academically were sound, were accepted inst an
tly, but the rest of 
the time there was no 
money, but if you could get a date with a Ge
rman girl, sure why not.  There was nothing 
else.  You were a young ma n and blood was 
boiling so of course you would go to the 
park and go by the river and enjoy yourself
 in the sense where travel was almost 
impossible, passes were hardly obtainable, 
money was not there and I was lucky because 
I was getting three square meals a day and 
whatever I could I shared with my buddies 
who tried to scrounge of
 food some place else.  
 
Q: But you never got too close to people?   
 

A: No.  I could not get close to anybody becau
se then the questions would follow about 
fa mily about school and I had enough of my ro
le intact to answer the basic questions, 
such as my family was killed.  I went to sc
hool such and such before the wa r, gammer 
school, who cared and the rest 
of it was being suppressed.  
 

Q: Did you feel like an imposter or 
that this was just the new you?   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
23 
 
A: It shifted.  There was a degree of self loat
hi ng at times.  There was a feeling that I was 
dishonest toward my ne wly acquired friends ot
he r student s, because one day they find out 
who I really am they would say to me , you 
were lying to us all along.  Anybody else who 
would come  even remotely close to my orig
inal background, I imme
diately stayed away 
from.  This is how I came to America because 
in the Polish guard forces there were only 
six, seven officers, a company of about 120, and 
two of them as I learned gradually were 
anti-semites and both of them were suspect
ing me  of being Jewish with little 
innuenendos.  Whenever an innuendo like that 
was directed towards me , I felt as if my 
whole world collapsed within.  I would be 
n utter depression for 
days, but not knowing 
what to do with myself and having to put a 
face out to the world so I would not betray 
myself.  My mi nd was made up.  Sooner or later 
there is going to be another Holocaust.  
There is going to be anot her genocide  becau
se it was unthinkable that the world would 

not try it all over the again, since Je
ws are reputed to be the killer of Christ, at least that is 
what I knew up to that time .  My mi nd was ma
de up that I wasn't  going to go through this 
again, that if I had a new identity and a r
easonable speech and deportment that I'm going 
to preserve that.  So, even though I could have
 stayed on in Germany for another year or 

two or three, because at that time  I was both a st udent and earning some  decent money 

where I could take girls out on dates and go 
to the opera and so on and had an imposing 
uniform and being an 15:18:  officer, the 
Germans respected more than anything else, 
Herr Leutnant, they woul d flatten themselves because if it's a military rank the Germans 

would respect that, no matter who that is.  If
 you don't have it, they'll step on you as fast 
on as a cockroach, but their respect for military uniform and authorities.  So, I had a fairly 

decent life in addition to attending university and teaching English and performi ng officer 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
24 
 
of the day every sixth day 24 hours, but I knew 
that that would not la
st.  That could not 
last, and that I wanted to go away as far 
as possi ble with my newly confirmed identity 
Polish catholic.  So, when everybody else, at 
least a great ma ny applied for immi gration 
so did I.  One day my number came up.  I had 
no affidavit. I had no 
relatives that I knew 
of or wanted to contact.  Eventually I lear
ned that my father's br
other lived in America 
for 40 some  years, and eventually I got to 
him.  But I put my name on the list and it 
turned out that this was a contingent provi
ded with blank affidavits by the Connecticut 
Tobacco Growers.  Connecticut had been gr
owing cigar tobacco for years and years, 
shaded fields, very hard labor.  We ll, 
a Mr. McCormick from near Bradleyfield 
Connecticut who wanted to get cheap la
bor, nothing wrong with that, American 
capitalist, you know, ma ke money where 15:20
:  you can, had some  Ja ma i can blacks but 
he wanted to have some  nicer white 
boys from Europe.  And through the NCWC, 
National Catholic We lfare Conference, Conf
erence of American  Bishops who were 
acting as the Jewish organizations were and 
others, to provide blank affidavits for young 
Polish refugees who had no place to turn.  So, I came  under that quota with $10 in my  

pocket flown by the Flying Tiger Company in 1950 from Munich via Kefl avik and 

Gander, New Foundland, because jets coul d not ma
ke the transatlantic trip yet, was taken 
to LaGuardia, and driven right to a tobaccofarm where we started the next morning at 

6:00.  I and some  twenty other Polish young men with no place to go 
were grateful that 
we were able to obtain American visa 
and the time was April 1950.  We came on the 

tobacco farm and were shown our lodgings
 which were the for mer CCC barracks, 
Civilian Conservation Corp under Roosevelt, 
clapped together with wooden boards, a 
barrack of maybe 30, 40 persons double bunks ha
lf of the m black Jama ican negroes and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
25 
 
half of us young Polish people.  Work was b
ack breaking under the shades, there were 
nets hung to protect the cigar t
obacco in case of rain so th
at the leaves would not be 
destroyed by rain or hail.  So, I was worki
ng 90 degrees in that heat under the nets which 
were back breaking and humi d 
beyond description.  75 cents an hour, half of the weekly 
income  was deducted for our food and room me a ning barracks and the food was ma de by 
Jama ican cooks.  To go to the nearest city, 
Hartford over the weekend we would probably 
spend the entire weekly wage whatever was left
 of it after taxes and deductions for food.  
This was my  beginning in the United States. 
 Wa r in Korea broke out six weeks after I 
came to this country, and when I weighed in
 my mi nd what to do next, am I going to 
finish university studies whic
h were almost out of the la
nd of fantasy, and income  and 
job, I had gone to the post office in Hartford 
Connecticut to voluntee
r for the airforce.  I 
was by that time  22.  I was in reasonably 
good condition, and I wanted to become  a pilot 
and when I think now what motivated me  to vol
unteer for the U.S. air force, I think there 
are at least three elements and in what proportio
n I'm not able to say.  One was that in my 
own view of romantic idealism still in all despite some individual inci dent s in Germany 

after the liberation, I was alive because so ma ny Americans di ed to conquer Hitler's 

machine.  I was liberated by the American 
army.  I was given entry into the  United 
States.  Now, as I saw it in my fairly naive 
roma ntic mi nd this country is in trouble.  It's  
being attacked by an enemy, that's  the North 
Koreans, so I would volunteer.  Secondly, I 
would feel proud to wear a legitimate Ameri
can uniform.  Now, I'm fully legitimate 
finally.  Thirdly, I felt that I would not ha
ve to work on a --by that time I know longer 
worked on a tobacco farm because I got a job in
 a factory in East Hartford I believe.  
Very, very difficult job where I threw 
up many times because there was no air 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
26 
 
conditioning, hot in the summer, wor king ona machine having to do a quota, also 75 
cents an hour and my stomach started acti
ng up and I started throwing up because I was 
not used to the combination of milk shakes
 on one hand which I couldn't digest properly 

and the humidity on the other hand.  So, by that
 time I already worked in a factory and I 
realized that if I volunteer fo
r the army I'll have rom and boa
rd after all and ma ybe, just 
ma ybe I 'll be able to continue my studies be
cause I knew by that time  what the G.I. bill 
had been.  What I didn't know was that it w
ould take a long time  
before Congress would 
award the Korean veterans that sa me  as 
World War II veterans because of political 
reasons the war in Korea was cal
led police action and not war. 
 But, in any event I then 
got caught in an incredible bur
eaucratic catch 22.  The Air Fo
rce told me  that I couldn't  
be accepted as a volunteer until I had my first 
papers.  First pa pers meant the declaration 
of intention to become  a U.S. citizen.  It w
ould take months before it would be processed 
bureaucratically and until then 
they couldn't accept me  into the arme d forces.  So, I was 
willing to wait and one day when I came back 
-- I was rent ing a room for I think $6 a 
week in We st Hartford in Beacon Street, tw
o elderly ladies who housed me.  One day I 
came in and my land lady said you 15:27:30ha
ve "greetings" and I said from whom?   
And she said from the United States, and I found 
out that that meant a draft notice.  It was 
called greetings. I said they can't  draft me  b
ecause I already volunteered to the air force 
and I ran to the captain and he then told me  
that was the catch 22.  As a resident of the 
United States, one could be drafted at any tim
e even a foreign student residing in this 
country could be drafted under the draft la
w, but to volunteer you have to have the 
declaration of intention to become  a U.S. c
itizen which takes months.  In any event, the 
army got me  and I ended up in I think one of 
the most abomi nable divisions I think as far 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
27 
 
as treatment is concerned the 44th division 
part of Oklahoma Nati
onal Guard where the 
cadre was what we called Oakies.  There were
 policemen and all kinds of other me n who 
felt that there would never be another war 
after World War II ther
efore they would get 
the income  drink beer over the weekend and get some  money for being in the National 
Guard.  All of a sudden war in Korea broke 
out, they were federalized and there was 
some thing like 3,000 of them cadre and they had to find 10,000 cannon fodder meaning 

northern boys to become  privates and all of
 them were upgraded and this as I found out 
they were taking out on us nor
therners still the ve ngefulness 
of the civil war.  You know, 
the oakies finally have a chance to get Yank
ees and to tell them what to do.  I went 
through some pretty hard times there.  On
ce I was sent on shit detail for two weeks 
because I defended blacks in the di vi sion.  Wh
en I was drafted into the U.S. Ar my in 
Nove mber of 1950, after very intensive basic 
training we had gone to Japan to train on 
the island of Hokaido.  The Stars and Stripes wrot
e that in the entire 
history of the United 
States Army there hadn't been as intensive an 
infantry training as 
our division because in 
the wake of the initial American defeats when
 the war in Korea broke out, when it turned 
out that the average American 
soldier was unprepared and unf
it physically to negotiate all 
the hills up and down, and up and down the te
rrain with backpacks, the Ar my was 
resolved on giving two divisions the 45th 
infantry Oklahoma  National Guard and the 
40th called the Sunburst of California to give 
them the most intens
ive training.  And it 
was one step from hell, the training.  I then re
solved that if I'm going to fight the war for 
this country I mi ght as well fight it and not 
get all the chicken feed from the tobacco 
chewing oakies as we called them and I volunteered for the front line service in Korea.  

Call it suicide instinct, whatever you wish, but
 I call it differently but that's for another 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
28 
 
time.  Eventually in Korea one year in the 
battle zone, there was some  tough times.  In 
fact there was a time  with Oklahoma  divisi
on on training where I se
riously considered 
suicide because I just could not take the 
vicious handling by the 
southern non-coms who 
treated us northern gun fodder with utter contempt.  This 
is also when I found out one 
more facet of true America when in Ok
lahoma National Guard sergeant once came into 
our barracks and started -- drunken, started a wh
ole tirade against blacks and there were 
some  blacks that served in our divisions but tr
oops were then still 
separated, and I opened 
my big mouth and I said well sergeant I'm 
serving this wonderful country because I 
believe in it's principle of equality and ju
stice and so on.  We ll, my punishment was two 
weeks on the shed detail, you know, diggingditches and so on.  So, I began to 

accumulate my treasury of the ma ny facets of 
America by that time .  And when I served 
my time and came to this country and applied 
for Yale, I had to wait about nine months 
or so before the next school year, but I 
was accepted and eventually I had gone to the 
Yale Drama School on three scholarships, the G.
I. bill, small scholarship from the Polish 

National Home  in Hartford, and after the firs
t semester, a half tuit
ion scholarship from 
Yale itself.  Plus, waiting on tables at  the la
w school, the likes of Bill Linc oln and George 
Bush [? ] had gone there probably just before 
me  or certainlyafte
r me.  Two hours a day 
to earn my three meals.  Washing windows dur
ing Easter vacation wh
en my rich friends 
went off snowboarding or skiing or whatever
, and driving a Good Humor ice cream truck 
in the summer to earn my keep for the next academic year.  Eventually I ma rried a local 

New Haven woma n, with whom I have a grow
n daughter, Ka ren.  I lived with her for 
three years, and she still 
didn't know my background.  She thought I was Polish catholic, 
because everything else I was suppressing.  
Nobody at Yale knew who I really was.

Once I almost had a nervous breakdown becau
se it seems that when I got close to 
someone I couldn't take even a small rejecti
on.  I thought I fell in love with a fellow 
student, but I think it was like 
a puppy love, and things functi
oned all right as long as I 
was like some one compared to driving a bi
ke, as long as you're moving and you work 
and you strive, you're okay.  The mi nute the bike  stops, you fall off.  So, that when some  

feelings started developing toward the young wo
ma n I felt that if she didn't  respond as 
much as I would want to emotionally, my whole world collapsed because  I could not take 

what I thought was emotional rejection.  No
 fa mily, no friends, no one close, so that 
became very difficult to handle and it became a 
recurring pattern later 
on as well.  In any 
event, when I got to New York after gra
duation some thing like A mi nus I guess, you call 
it with honors, I tried to get a job with CBS b
ecause the stage jobs that were availabl e to 
me  were not enough to support a wife and 
a young child.  Among others I had gone to 
CBS because at that time CBS was developing 
a lot of good drama, whi c h is now almost 
gone practically gone.  St udio One, etc.  The foll
owing incident I think is rather poignant.  
There was one ma n in the CBS television by th
e name  of Ji m Levinthal who interviewe d 
me .  As I was hoping to get an entry while be
ing a page at NBC working the Steve Allen, 
the Tonight Show and so on, I think  $44 a w
eek as a uniform paid for by NBC.  I had 
gone to see  Jim Levinthal at CBS two more 
times and at one point he said  to me -- 
and he was in charge of hi
ring production assistants to
 become stage managers and 
directors, like John Frankheimer for example 
who had gone through that
 route.  He asked 
me where did you say you came from and I said
 I came from Germany.  He burst out and 
he said to me, "I'll be goddamn if I 'm goi
ng to hire for the CBS program departme nt, 
someone who came from Germany."  And that
 was that.  Jim Levinthal obviously an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
30 
 
American Jew and I was a Polish Jew and he turned me down because I had come from 
Germany.  I n this sense I suppose he reaffirm
ed his glorious American Jewish identity 
where he wouldn't hire someone who had come 
from Ger ma ny.  So muc h for that scene, 

and that route was cut off.  Eventually I got
 in through another door.  Whi l e I was at CBS 
the first few years of course everybody knew me  
as a Polish catholic and that as that.  My 
ma rriage was breaking up, and in '59 I was di
vorced and I was still with CBS.  About the 
time before the marriage was broke up after 
three years, I was driving from Hartford 
Connecticut to Mt. Vernon New Yor k, where I lived with my  then family, and a 

passenger was a mi ddle aged woman from Israel.  She impressed me as having being 

ma de of an entirely different cloth.  Tough 
and hard nosed and courageous and speaking 
of the new Israeli pioneer sp
irit although she introduced hers
elf Polish Jewish.  At one 
point she sat in the back, my wife ne xt to
 me  she fired a point blank question.  Are you 
Jewish?   I said yes.  Then I surprised myself
.  It was some thing in her demeanor, in her 
deportment that apparently got through to me . 
 She then spent the night with us and one 
word led to another and it opened up a w
hole past life for my then wife who knew 
nothing about it.  It was that woma n from Is
rael who began to insist whether I had any 

relatives in the world, and I said that I unders
tood that my father's brother who had come  

to this country in the 20s 
that he was here some where.  She wanted to know why I 
wouldn't look him up and I said of course not. Fi rst of all, he wouldn't understand me .  

He would condemn me.  Secondly, 
I have nothing to do with hi
m.  I never met him, and I 
have some  questions to him if I me t him wh
ich I don't want to, what was he doing when 
we were being 'geharget" as they say in Yi
ddish, or exterminated and I don't want to go 
through the whole war time  history with hi
m because he would want it.  She had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
31 
 
undertaken upon herself to try to trace my unc
le, my father's younger brother, and when 
she had ma de contact, she prev
ailed on me  to me et him using 
every kind of appeal for me  
to consent.  When I finally did, we made 
a date because my uncle lived in Brooklyn and 
we lived in Mt. Vernon.  We  ma de a date to 
meet at Rockefeller Center, 30 Rock Plaza, 
as you walk in through the ma in door, I reme
mb er, in the ma in lobby, he described how 
he would look and Mrs. Bergma
n, the woman from Israel acc
ompanied me.  At once we 
saw a little ma n, sli m with an elderly woma n 
apparently his wife.  She approached him 
and confirmed his identity.  He walked up to
 me -- that is my uncle, my closest living 
relative, 1959, which is 14 years after the wa
r.  He pulled me  to the side, walked over 
toward the very corner of the ma rble wall ther
e, and said to me  are you Joe, Yossl?   I said 
yes.  He looked to me  turned towards the wall and started crying like a little baby.  He 

couldn't say another word.  It was I who had 
to gently pat him on the back and say Uncle 
Sa m, all right, calm down now.  I had to ca
lm him down.  Well, eventually I started 
visiting him and my marriage broke up, but s
hortly before it did, my wife started to 
persuade me  to try to find out who I really 
am because I was between and betwixt.  All of 

a sudden when that Pandora's box had been 
tapped I had no idea of who I was anymor e, 
how I should act, what I should aim for and what
 my identity was etc.  So, that my uncle 
-- through a ruse I found 
later, but through a ruse, ma de 
an appointment with me and a 
16:14:  Rabbi in New Rochelle, who then was th
e presiding Rabbi of Ne w York City.  It's  
a rotating function.  Rabbi David Golemvenski, now deceased.  Through a ruse because if 

my uncle would have asked me  to see a Rabbi
 I would have turned him down.  I would 
say I have nothing to do with a Rabbi.  I didn'
t even know one before the war in a Jewi sh 
fa mily which was traditional but not very relig
ious.  But he used a 
rouse together with a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
32 
 
rabbi I was told that the Jewish Center needed
 a director to direct 
a play.  That was the 
rouse.  I said sure, okay.  When I went ther
e little by little, he  wa
s a rabbi in the U.S. 
Marine Corp and advisor in Jewish Affairs am
ong others to President Roosevelt.  A ma n 
very accomplished and very bright .  Well, one wo
rd led to another and he started a series 
of conversations with me  and once I opened up I 
started letting him have it.  I said where 
were all the rabbis when we were being surr
ounded.  Where were the rabbis when we had 
to reaffi rm our national identity in the spir
it of resistance they instead urged us not to 
offer any resistance because a good Jew doesn't
 she blood and so on.  Wh ere were all the 
rabbis that for two thousand y
ears taught us passivity instead
 of reaffir mation of huma n 
dignity through resistance and so 
on.  By the time that I started these conversations after I 
had me t the rabbi once only I decided to seek out Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, who was a 
national fi gure, like Reverend Robertson today or Billy Graham.  Fulton Sheen as a 

bishop had a half hour show on t.v. nationwideand was an incredible speaker.  So, I 
thought I would repair to him and seek his a
dvice.  I was in his home  on Muray Hill a 
number of times, and we  had ma ny c onversations
 and it was then that my uncle Sam said 
to me  well, you're a rational ma n.  You went to Yale.  Certainly why shouldn't you listen 

to the other side.  I said sure it ma kes sens
e.  And I started seeing Rabbi Golovensky.  In 

the fi nal anal ysis it di dn't solve many of my problems of identity and the really point of 

explosion occurred when my uncle in about 1960 
or so finally one day laid it on the table 
and said to honor my par e nts and to honor 
Jewish people in my heritage and so on, he 
says I had been baptized under duress as he ca
lled it and I called it not.  I said it was of 
my own volition.  He said well, what did you know you were 15 years old.  You were 

frightened, you were terrified to death and 
the ma n was kind to you and told you there is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
33 
 
another god who is more  valid and so on and 
in the name  of that god Jews had been 
murdered for centuries and in the name  of Chri
st allegedly as Christ
 killers, the biggest 
lie in history.  So, my uncle 
ma de me  an ultima tum, in fact wrote me  a letter which I 
believe I have to this day 
saying that I ought to publicly renounce catholicism and 
reconvert to be a Jew, possibly some  
kind of a mu mbo jumbo ceremony.  I said 
absolutely not.  Whatever happened, ha
ppened, and it happene d because a ma gnificent 
young ma n, a priest, in the name  of his god, but 
his god must be our god if we believe in 
unideism, or else nothing ma kes sense. In th
e name  of the higher postulates of religion 
and human morality he  risked hi s life because he 16:19:  believes that  love  thy neighbor 
is the basic tenet.  A ma n who did that for me
 in the name  of his religion or call it is 
liturgy cannot be wrong, must be a worthy person and I am not going to spit him in the 

face and walk out on everything he  taught me
 only because you who did nothing to save 
me  want me  to.  We  had a few very explosiv
e conversations and it sent me into a long 
bout of depression.  I believe 
at that point CBS has layoffs
 so the people with least 
seniority had to be laid off. 
 As it turned out several months
 later they rehired me , but I 
already had a job with the U.N. then, and I wa
s in the most abysma l state of depression.  
Again deserted, again alienated from ever
ybody, again feeling myself deserted by my 
next of kin who said that if I don't reconve
rt he will condemn me and doesn't  want to 
have anything to do with me .  In one of 
the conversations I reme mber was rather 
explosive in his home and I asked him point 
blank, telling him that a decent Pole, a 
Christian with the help of a few other priest
s saved my life, riski
ng it every mi nute of the 
day and I asked him at one point, what did you 
do Uncle Sam to save your own fa mi ly at 
the time when strangers were
 saving Jews lives?  What 
did you do?   And he started 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
34 
 
giving me what I call etcha petcha metcha
, which means well you know there was some 
anti-semitism and there were the German Bund 
here and it wasn't  so easy, and I said did 
you chain yourself to the gate of the White 
House as a prot est because your brother and 
you fa mily was being exterminated.  If you didn'
t you have no right to tell me  how to live 
my life, and what friend to honor, and whom to
 be loyal to.  So, the following period, if I 
reme mber, about two years where I had nothing 
to do with him or his wife.  And I was 
told in retrospect that he c
ouldn't sleep nights.  That he 
was crying and so on, but what I 
felt all along would happen that 
sooner or later if not my unc
le then some one else would 
condemn me a traitor to the Jewish race b
ecause I was baptized.  Along in about 1962, by 
pure chance I had walked into Yivo, the Je
wish Historical Institute because Rabbi 
Golvensky felt and insisted that I ought 
to go.  There ma y be a photograph or ma ybe 
something of my family of my
 past because I had nothing to 
reestablish the link with my 
past and to his credit he insi
sted and pressed me .  So, I di
d, and when I walked into Yivo, 
and said who I was, my original name , there still was on the st aff the few survivors who 

of course knew music and culture in Pola
nd, and a ma n by the name  of Finklestein 
imme diately popped and said of course I knew your
 father.  I said to myself, yes, a lot of 

people say they know my father like a lot 
of people know the pope, or Lenny Bernstein 
but does he know everyone.  I was used to that by the way.  When I was a child 

everybody said I know your father and it turned
 out my father didn't even know the man.  
So, within mi nutes he called from upstairs, 
as it turned out a re
vered, gentlema n by the 
name  of Jonas Turkow, a fa mous Polish actor 
and director before World War II, who as it 
turned out was a friend a my father was w
ith my father in the committee for underground 
in the Wa rsaw Ghetto.  His wife was the 
famous Diana Blumenthal, a chanteuse for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
35 
 
whom my fa ther wrote songs at one time
, and he came down when I was introduced.  
Finklestein said this is Joseph 
Fajwiszys, he said you are little
 Joe?   I said, yes I guess so.  
Well, that's when the next chapter in my long track to reestablish my roots so to speak 
had begun.  Because Ilu Turkow then had me  in this home and with his wi fe Diana 

Blumenthal showed me  a handwritten song my
 father wrote once for his wife which he 
buried in a can in the Warsaw Ghetto ruins be
fore he ma naged to scale the wall posing as 
a Polish railroad ma n and found it after the war.
  He gave me  and I 
still have it, and a 
long, long conversation started w
ith a ma n whose daughter, hers
elf, had been given over 
to Christians and when he survived the wa
r his daughter who by then
 was eight or nine 
was saying oh those goddamn Jews, was inbued 
with anti-semitism by the very people to 
whom Turkoff entrusted his own daughter.  So, 
his daughter also had a very difficult road 
back but at least had the origin
al father and mother and so on,
 and still I unde
rstand as of  
a few years ago, she's not in very good shape me ntally.  We ll, Turkoff as if he had found 
his own son.  This went on for a number of mo nths.  I came to respect him and regard 
him highly because he had no religious ax to grind.  He was just a ma n of culture.  A man 

of tradition but progressive and so on.  And 
one day, he told me  that a man had visited 

him who wa s in the Wa rsaw Ghetto uprisi
ng and that he would like to start an 
organization that had some thing to do with t
hose who were in the resistance move me nt in 
the Wa rsaw Ghetto and wanted me  to be part of
 it.  I had grave scruples.  I didn't want to 
do anything about it, but more a
nd more he appealed to my conscience and the rest is 
history, because the few of us that's Jack Eisner, Jonas Stutkoff, Bob Bjorn and Joe 

Tulesky, Latka Meed and myself, formed an 
organization that we didn't know for we eks 
how to call it.  Finally I came up with the 
acronym WAGRO, Wa rsaw Ghetto Resi stance 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
36 
 
Organization and I threw myself 
into that work, even though I was with CBS at the same  
time.  We wanted to among other things, th
e objectives we discussed but then I wrote 
them the final version and they'r e still everyd
ay at Madison Square Garden it's all there, 
it's all my language among other things is to 
build a me morial to Wa rsaw Ghetto heroes 
in New York.  And we started raising funds
 for it with $1 little coupon contributions.  I 
sold them to anybody, from Walter Cronkite, to Mike Wallace, you name it, hundreds.  
Then it turned out from the treasur er I coul
dn't get an accounting of how much mone y we 
took in.  
 

Q: How did this impact you psychologically when 
you had to all of sudden start dealing with 
a past that you had put very mu
ch in the back of your mi nd?   
16:27   
A: Well, both consciously and unc
onsciously I think that I felt that I fi nally no matter what 
the religious scruples were and no matter whic
h church or synagogue I chose to pray in 
that it's my own da mn business but at least I 
am who I am and I am the son of my father 
and I am the product of a certain tradition.  
The conflicts came  with
 what I call the low 
class people, the Yiddishists, not that every 
Yiddishist is low class.  Don't mi sunderstand 
me .  There are some  ma rvelous writers and poets
, but Yiddishist in this
 context I call low 
class people who even before the war didn'
t know the language of the country but only 
spoke Yiddish and now wanted to rema ke histor
y in the ima ge of their particular social 

class.  And people who wore their congre
ssional me dal honor which I called their 
concentration camp star, as a congressional me
dal of honor.  In other words, any Jew who 
had not been to a concentration camp can only be
 relegated to secondary
 or tertiary role 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
37 
 
because they were the front line troops.  
If you were not in a concentration camp, you 
don't count.  Your voice is not important.  Y
ou were too assimilated.  If you know Polish 
literature if you want to speak
 your mother tongue, which wa
s Polish in my case, and the 
case of Anielewicz, that's  secondary.  Yiddish
 is our language, concentration camp is our 
passport and that's  that.  They would not 
admit any dissenting voices.  My clean break 
with them came after a year and a half wher
e I was the only American educated member 
with everyone asking me  to do things from
 the composition to board of directors and 
getting a non profit status and tax exempt st
atus and doing the firs
t two comme morations 
including one at Carnegie Ha
ll organizing the whole thing ar
tistically and managerially 
and all I asked for is that we run ourselves
 according to the Amer
ican principles of 
legality and democracy.  So, when it came to
 elections, and I had no ambi tion to be a 
president but only to elect some one else, th
ere we re two slates and they quashed down 
the second slate with big arms  and strong pushy 
elbows and at that time , I left.  So once 
more I left my people.  
 End of Tape 2

Tape 3   
 

A: Ever since I began to acknowledge my roots 
which goes back to '59 and '6 2, it's been now 
over 30 years of intermittent, at time  tortuous
, inne r life, except that I no longer am 
hiding -- parts of me are stil
l hiding, but by and large I'm not.  A cynic mi ght say it come s 
with age because the closer we 
are to the end of our life we 
care less about when it mi ght 
start all over again and from history we know th
at the ways of persecution of Jews and 
we see in the world today where other mi norities are occasionally being exterminated by 

others.  You don't have to be Jewish to be
 a Biafran, Nigerian, Bosnian and Serbian, and 
so on and so on, but you begin to care less and 
less about survival at any cost.  Now it 
ma tters, survival with integrity.  As I was 
construing my integrity way back then, I felt 
that and I've been throughout my childhood th
at any Jew who would 
convert is a traitor 
to the nation, and I believed it because what 
else was I to believe 
except everythi ng I was 
taught.  Eventually through the shock of the se
lections and the extermination phase when 
I was desperate and destitute a
nd a young priest put hi
s life on the line for me , but also 
taught me a great many things which I had not 
been taught in my ch
ildhood.  I was taught 
a few prayers, just mu mbling them i n order to
 satisfy one class in 
school and that was the 
end of it.  I had been to synagogue ma ybe 
two t hree times a year
 on the high holidays 
because my father felt that he ought to put
 in an appearance and occasiona lly he 
conducted a 12 voice choir or played the philharm
onia which was sort of like an organ.  
But it had been inbuted in me  
that throughout that a Jew who is baptized and is converted 

is a traitor to his nation.  He does it only 
for self advancement or for other commercial 
reasons.  That is why I fe lt that when I was 
baptized by the priest and I reme mber once he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
39 
 
told me  that it would be inte
resting to know if I would hold 
faith with the truth as he 
taught me  in addition to love thy neighbor of 
which he was the best exemplified tenet, but 
also about Christ and so on.  He said at one point it would 
be interesting to know that 
when the war was over if I would keep fait
h, because he says throughout centuries Jews  
converted in order to survive when it was 
more convenient and when the threat was no 
longer there they reconverted as 
he said a Jew will always be a Jew.  I was determined to 
prove to him as I construed my integrity that 
that was not so, that 
I would be faithful to 
the faith as he taught me .  That I woul
d not change 180 degrees the mi nute it was 
convenient to me  and the mi nute that was 
over that I could get help from Jewish 
organizations.  In fact I had never gone to
 a Jewish organization.  I came to America on 
my own, worked on a tobacco farm but I woul
d not go to a Je wish organi zation because 
then I would have to go through the third degr
ee and say oh but I baptized, I'm very sorry 
now could you help me  with money.  I woul
d not do that.  So, throughout all this I felt 
that I've lost everything, but my integrity 
as a huma n being, and as a huma n being I ought 
to keep faith with the pr iest that saved my lif
e.  That was my contract, that's it's okay to 
convert when you saw the true light or 
human kindness or me rcy as exemplified by 
another religion, but it's not 
okay to reconvert because then
 you have no values left.  
 

Q: Is religion a contract 
or is simply a belief?   

 

A: Being in cont act with Father Furkosksy for the last 50 years, I was guilty of not 
answering hi s letters some ti me s for a year or  
longer, but he never got
 angry.  He always 
wrote again and again with love and compa
ssion and understanding until
 we had our first 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
40 
 
reunion and second and then later on in Israel
 when he was decorated and so on.  But 
there were long periods when I didn't see co
ntact with 17:07:30  him bec a use I felt I 
would have to live up to what he expected me
, and I found that I progressively could not.  
I could not live a chaste life.  As I told 
him once that without a 
love of a woma n, I don't 
want to live in this world.  He said he 
could understand that, that
 I had to get to the 
bottom of the few reasons for the persecution of Jews as he had implanted in me .  That 
resulted eventually in a film that I was 
prevailed upon to do, name ly Children in the 
Holocaust that nearly devastated me .  I just 
couldn't  sleep nights and so on and going to 
ten countries and listening to stories of some  of
 t he survivors that I couldn't  even ima gine 
that such plight existed in other cases.  A
nd throughout it all I had to 
find myself.  Myself 
meaning that at one point I read all the 
four epistles from begi nning to end and I 
immersed myself in books on the sources of anti-semitism and by omission and 

commission and by hiding by running away by 
struggling over ma ny years, I have finally 
reached what I believe is going to st ay with me
 and stick with me and that's me.  That's 
only in the last few recent years.  What is me , 
fi rst of all.  I am w
ho I a m in terms of my 
birth, my roots, my heritage.  There's no getting away from that.  I am proud of it as much 

as an Irishman is proud to be Irish and a Pole
 is proud to be Polish.  No more and no less.  
I condemn and have so done in articles and speeches that I have ma de.  Pe ople no ma tter 

what their ethnic grouping is, Jews or non Je
ws who look for a scape goat.  Anti-semi tes 
look for Jews as scapegoats when the economy is down and they say it's  all the faults of 

the Jews.  Jews when they feel empowered fi
nd a scapegoat in others.  Whether they be 
certain degrees of second citizenship among 
Palestinians, and I'm not a utopian and I 
know the reality and self pr
eservation, or for ma ny years claimi ng that all Poles are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
41 
 
anti-semites, which is equally untrue.  Becau
se according to Yad va Shem 37 percent of 
all righteous Christians honor
ed were Poles.  There are 
Jewish circles who condemn 
Poles for anti- semitism simply because it is
 now more convenient because  there are now 
until at least recently they were more helpless than the Germans.  The same Jews who go 

to visit Germany or receive pension checks fr
om Ger many do not attack Germans en bloc 
but they do attack Poles en bloc, meaning that 
there are some  absolutely undeniable facts.  

The undeniable facts are the holocaust, the Na
zi extermination and their collaborators.  
That is absolutely undeniable.  It is also 
undeniable that among ot
her nations there were 
victims who were tortured because of the na
tionalism, because they saved others, a few 
hundred Polish priests and nuns were executed 
because they sheltered the Jews.  That 

cannot be shoved under the rug either.  We  Je
ws do not have the license to righteousness 
only or to suffering.  We  must continuously
 also honor those who were tortured by 
dictatorship and Nazism and continuously uphol
d as role models those who risked their 
lives to save ma ny of us.  So, who am I?   I'm a J e w and a Pole.  I'm also an American 

citizen and I hope a very loyal one.  But 
anybody who would want to press further be 
they a scientist or a common Yente would 
want the question between diverse would 

always be no, so who are you?   So, do you go to church or do you believe in Jesus 

Christ?   My first answer is non of your goddamn
 business.  What I do in private is my 
own self -- my own bus iness as
 long as I don't deny who I 
am and whether I am more 
comfortable to walk into c
hurch or synagogue, that's  my own business.  Now, for 
posterity and for the sake of
 bearing witness and making a 
record, do I believe in Jesus 
Christ because it all comes down 
to that right, sooner or late
r, right.  Either you do or you 
don't.  Either you go right or you go left, said 
Mengele, right?  First 
of all, I don't agree 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
42 
 
with that kind of a Nazi theory that 
I owe it to anybody, to anybody in the world, to 
publicly identify myself with th
is or with that.  Having said
 that, my personal belief to 
this day is do I believe in God?   Some ti me s 
 yes, some ti me s not.  I believe that if he's 
omnipotent, he must have been on vacation for 
a very long time.  I th
ink I'm fa miliar with 
almost every dogmatic or church, dogmatic 
possible answer to th
e 17:15:  question.  
Well, God had simply set these things in mechanism but he gave us fr ee will and so on.  I 
am fa miliar with every one of these postulat es because I've been taught and I discussed it 

with my priest and with others.  Recently with
 a father professor of 
the catholic university 
in Lublin who was here.  We  had hours of conversation.  So, do I believe in God?   

Some times I do and sometimes I don't.  Do I believe in Jesus Christ?   From every 

historical bit if evidence, there was such a 
ma n who lived and such ma n must have been a 

role model along with several others throughout
 the ages for huma nity to pursue possibly 
never to attain, because  who'
s willing to just abscond everything and just  put on a sack 
and eschew all the riches of 
the world etc, etc.  Si nce such me n lived, and expounded all 
the goodness and all the me rcy, this to me  along with some  other some what antiquated 

wise sayings fr om the bible and the koran and whatever  constitutes the essence of human 

ethics and morality but advanced one or 
two steps more.  Meaning, that goodness and 
love they neighbor is no longer the province 
of Jews toward fellow Jews but anyone is 
my neighbor, anyone is.  If that had not been 
taken seriously by my 
savior, my priest, and 
thousands of others like him, I woul dn't be here
 to talk to you, and 
the last vestiges of 
morality and ethics expounded by the three ma jor religions would be gone, even though 

they collapsed long ago in Europe which has 
fought catholic and protes
tant one another.  
So, that if Jesus Christ e
xpounded these ideals in the name
 of which people are willing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
43 
 
risk their lives to serve their 
neighbor, a stranger, 
these are some  of th
e highest ideals in 
the world.  Now, to go to one step further to the ultimate leve l, do you be lieve  he was a 
god?   We ll, there are theologians to this day 
who are not sure, protes
tant and catholic.  I 
read all 17:18:  four epistles 
cover to cover to this day, a
nd I don't see anywhere Christ 
saying I am God.  He said I am the son of G
od, but in the next chap
ter, another evangelist 
or he himself says, we are all children of
 God, so to claim the deity of God, the 
immaculate conception of Virgin Mary which 
some  protestant rej
ect also can go on and 
go on.  In the final analysis who do I pray to
?   None of your goddamn bus iness.  I pray 
when I pray to God whenever I have hopes that 
he exists and not that he owes me  a lot, 
but I think he owes all of us a lot in orde
r to justify the innocent slaughter of children, 
millions of them in the world, to this day.  But if there is some kind of a mechanism that I 

don't understand, then I'm willing to say well I 
don't understand that and in times when I 
must clutch onto some thing, and if I believe th
at there is a god, yes, some times I pray to 
him.  What I say to him is between him 
and me .  I own no accounting to anyone else, 
possibly to the ma n who saved my life, but 
then he and I we have our own way of 
communicating.  We  understand each other.  
 

Q: Is it possible for with your experiences to 
live with no acknowledgeme nt of religion?  
 

A: Well, the same question can be posed to millions of other Americans who --  

 

Q: Yes, but I'm talking about you.  Is
 religion important to you today?   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
44 
 
A: Well, if I reached the end of my struggle ma
ybe I'll be able to phrase it better for you.  
I'm still struggling day by day.  I very seldom go to church or synagogue.  When I do, 
some ti me s I'm very comfortable in church and at time s when I  get the goose pimples 

thinking that in the name  of this or that
 my ancestors were being murdered by the 

thousands.  When I go to a synagogue I don't 
really feel very much because it's been 
dulled by what I think has been
 the exclusiveness 
of the Jewish religion as we know it 

today.  That I no longer feel having been w
ith ma ny non Jews in situation of extreme 
danger and in combat and in living in suffe
ring with non-Jews as 
well and seeing that 
they have the same  humanity as I do.  They
 also suffer and cry and shake when there is 
fear, and often would do anything for me  as 
I have few friends like this, like these 
non-Jews, I refuse to acknowledge that I am so
mehow the chosen smarter, more talented, 
better and more adept than my fellow citizens, or  good friends, non-Jews.  I refuse to.  I 

excel in one way and they excel in some thing el
se.  I cannot be part of
 an official religion 
that claims we are the chosen people and c
ontinue to be chosen because that is an 
invitation to exclusivity and to snobbish.  Y
ou mi ght say survival also, but it's not our 
fault that the world had st olen the reformed 
Judaism from us because
 I call Jesus Christ 
the reformed Judaism.  From every availabl
e fact, he simply tried to reform the ongoing 
corruption that sooner or later seeps into ev
erything, into government into any organized 
religion.  He tried to reform that and any
time you try to reform an establishment you're 
going to be condemned.  This goes on in the U.
S. air force or Jewish religion everywhere 
else.  I simply cannot be part of a segment,
 17:24:  religious or 
otherwise that claims 
exclusivity and some how a leve
l above everyone else that ma
y have existed at one time , 
but I don't think it should any longer and 
I am all for people organizing and having 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
45 
 
cultural groups and so on.  If you want to go 
to synagogue that's  fine, but if you ask me , I 
have been back and forth to hell and back 
so ma ny times that I only --it's nice when I can 
speak Polish or when I'm with a few people who were born in the same  Jewish section as 
I was in Lodz, but the rest of the time I 
seek the few who are imbued with value of 
huma nity because unfortunately as time and again when push come s to shove it's the 

small mi nority that  come s to the top when th
ey have a chance, the gangsters and others, 
give the mafia half a chance and they'll ru
le, permeate Italian gove
rnme nt, you name  it.  
The bulk of the people care about only what 
they'r e going to do and eat the next day and 
how they'r e going to dress their children.  For that sake, 
they'r e willing to swallow 
anything and they will not do much and they
 will not risk their neck and a small 
percentage of what I call elite of humanity ar
e the noblest and the finest.  They'r e seldom 
rich.  They're seldom on top of the worl
d.  They'r e seldom occupying the highest 

positions, but I only seek out those people.  
 

Q: I'm thinking that to some extent you dism
issed religion as a cont
ract, I'm wondering what 
it is that ma de you have a need to find your 
roots?   What is important about religion?  
 

A: Whichreligion?  

 

Q: Any religion and yours that ma de you need to see him again?  

 

A: I have not sought the Jewish religion if
 you mean by organized re
ligion.  I think that 
some of the abuses in the world have been 
committed in the name  of religion.  I have not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
46 
 
come  back to my roots to seek the Jewish religi
on, not at all.  I've come  back to my roots 
first of all to make peace with myself not to 
cont inue living with self
 denial.  Secondly, to 
honor the memory of my father and my mother 
and my sister.  They were who they were 
and they were innocently slaughtered and I ha
ve no right to deny th
em.  Everything else 
in terms of my public identification with ma
ny of the ma nife stations of what we call 
religious life, I see so much intellectual co
rruption and twisting and revision wherever I 
turn, be it the Jewish organized
 life or  catholic organized lif
e, so I didn't seek to be 
admitted to the bosom of the Jewish religion.  It doesn't mean a thing to me.  I don't seek 
to be an official me mber of the catholic chur ch either.  
 

Q: I think what I'm asking is, is the Jewish 
religion for you?   I'm not saying going to the 
synagogue every Friday night, but does it embody
 a sense of history 
a sense of tradition, 
a sense of culture.  
 

A: History, tradition, culture, yes.  

 

Q: It's  part of you?   

 

A: As far as the widening of the ethical and mo
ral concept of the Jewi
sh bible onto the rest 
of humanity, I think that this is what 
Christianity accomplished although it has been 
guilty of ma ny lies such as expropriating the reform Judaism as I call Jesus Christ as a 

rabbi, expr opriating and in the name  of 
accepting his tene ts of love thy neighbor, 

murdering Jews which is the most advanced li
e and bigotry in the world.  But I do believe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
47 
 
that the way of ma king ethics 
and mo rality avai lable to all humanity is the way that I 
believe  18:01:  it.  Call it what you will.  
If anybody would ask me  the catch all question 
as to what have been the after effects and the consequences of all these experiences, well 
it's like trying to reduce Homer's odyssey 
down to one paragraph.  One can do it only 

with sufficient distance, and I think now af
ter some 50 years I think I have achieved 
sufficient distance.  In my case first of all fo
r ma ny years I had to play ma ny roles.  It's 
like the seven ages of man from Shakespear
e.  Until and only recently I stopped playing 
roles.  In other words, I would bend my beha
vior to what I felt I should sound like, speak 
like, behave and what my attitudes shoul
d be to one person versus another person 
depending on who they were, Americans, Poles, 
Jews, etc.  So, I played various roles.  
That eventually resulted in not
 only dichotomy, but in some  self
 loathing as to who I am.  
That has been the easier part.  More difficult 
part that caused me  incessant inner torture 

and suffering and 18:03:  struggling has been th
e alienation for most of my life from most 
people.  So, with the result th
at I don't trust mos t  people anyway, and the few instances 
that some one appeals to me , I tend to go ove
rboard, meaning that I try to ma ke up for 
what I lost in growing up, in the love  of fath
er, mother, sister, relatives, teachers, peers 
and so on, and become  periodically over 
enthusiastic and overtrusting until I get 
disappointed but that began tolevel itself off with age.  So, I am absolutely convinced 

that my one great regret is th
at if I didn't  have these cr
ippling problems of r unning away, 
of alienation of avoiding deeper relationships, that I could 
have achieved much more than 
I have, and to some  degr ee I have achieved 
what I was able to do, but in spite of my 
problems and diffi culties.  Three university dipl omas and a stint on broadway, starting 

my own theater, etc. et c, the rest  is in 
Who's Who in America, but I'm still extremely 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
48 
 
dissatisfied with myself because
 I think I could ha ve and should have achi eved more.  
When I would go on vacation for example with my second wife who told me  that I was 
the biggest pa in in the neck when I was on 
vacation because within
 a day or two I was 
already restless and wanting to get back to st
art another project or get back to work.  I 
simply could not enjoy vacation because I th
ink deep down I felt that I had no right to 
just be me rry and mi rthful and enjoy myself 
while all my people had been exterminated.  
It's a sense of guilt that every day that I get up that I don't further the cause of either 

bearing witness or creating yet another project 
and justify my survival.  Whatever I have 
accomplished which by some measure is little, and by other point of view may be I 

suppose of note, has happened despite great ma ny personal problems in relating to 

people.  For example, when I was with CBS 
and c a se in point when I worked with Don 
Hewitt who is now a big celebrity, creator of 60 
mi nutes etc., this is just  a case in point, 
not to appear on Entertainment Tonight, but I kn
ow that I could have 
easily been one of 
the producers or directors on 60 mi nutes or so
ap operas or whatever and I have worked 
against mys e lf a critic mi ght say in that when
 I felt for example that on a soap opera that 
the values were trite, that they were munda ne, that they were exploitive, I had such 

contempt for the people who in view of everyt
hing that has happened to this world and to 
me  personally and to holocaust and all of that, 
that these people could 
still deal with these 
trite and superficial problems 
instead of delving deeper into
 the human conditions for the 
edification of themselves and others, that I li
terally had contempt for those values and I'm 
sure that I've shown it and said so a number 
of times.  Well, that's why I'm not a producer 
or a director on a soap opera making a quarter
 million dollars a year today, but it doesn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
49 
 
matter to me  because I would spitting in my
 face if I build my 
life around these trite 
values.  
 
Q: Do you have the right
 to enjoy yourself?   

 

A: To me  enjoyment is even with no holocaust 
but simply responding to my education in the 
European condition in my field which has 
been theater and lately expanded into 
television ma ybe film, that simply is being 
faithful to my profession.  A doctor considers 
his calling, if he's a good doctor, to treat ot
hers and prevent suffering and pain.  We ll, 
being in the theater fr om which I have  emer
ged professionally, my calling is to examine 
the human condition, some ti me s through laughter
, often seriously.  But 18:09:  the 
triteness and the superficiality that I fi nd in 
the commercial field to me  is repugnant.  It's  
a violation of every - - it's the same way that
 a doctor would work only to push as mu ch 
penicillin or aspirin as he possibly can 
only to enrich hims elf, you know just push 
prescriptions.  
 

Q: Can you enjoy a walk on the beach?  

 

A: Oh yes of course I can. But.. 

 

Q: Simplepleasures?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
50 
 
A: Yes.  But to go off on va cation for more than 
a few days, I feel guilty and I feel that I am 
not doing some thing worthwhile.  You don't have 
to be Jewish to enjoy Jewish rights.  
You don't have to live through the Holocaust to
 be committed to some  deeper values and 
the calling of the profession.  But I think it'
s only been exacerbated by my  experiences 
because I think that I ought to do something m
eaningful all the time to justify my survival 
and in that sense I'm not the ideal person to
 live with and only th
ink of what fun to 
dedicate my self to after working hours.  
And for ma ny, many years having lost my 
fa mily, having lived in so much fear and 
terror, having felt myself abandoned by my 
fa mily, by Jews, by the rest of the world, it
 was probably inevitable that in personal 
relationships for ma ny years, I would construe
 a small slight as a rejection and then 
respond in kind by either more forceful repart
ee or by running away.  In other words, 
terminating a relationship, and this has haunt
ed me for many, many years.  Until by the 
time I was able to gain an insightful look into 
it, I was getting older.  So, that's  been the 
other after affect but it's like saying some one wh
at is it like giving birth to a child.  You 
can understand it intellectually, but unless you've gone thr
ough all the trepidations and 
the enormous pain, you don't really understand 
it.  So, you can talk 18:12:  about these 
things, but to have lived through 
the constant terror first to 
survive, and then to protect 
what you construed was your integrity
 but in fact was a false iden
tity and live in terror of 
being unmasked.  Because  if I was unmasked th
en I had no place to turn.  I had no place 
to turn.  There was no going back and thee wa
s no going forward, so I had to protect that 
carefully constructed false identity and I think th
is has been the greatest curse of the after 
affects. [PAUSE]   Well, there is, as
 you probably know a f
ilm made by a Kibbutz 
Lokhame i Hagettaoth in Israel some  20 years 
ago called the 29th blow or 49th Blow or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
51 
 
some thing.  That is some what a dramatic of my
 a pproach, the conclusion of that film.  In 
other words, there was a survivor who so
me how lived through some  27 bl ows being 
whipped by SS or by the Gestapo.  But the worst, the 28th blow was after the war when 
he had found out that the world was so little inte
rested in what he had to say.  I reme mber 
when we establishe d the Wa rsaw Ghetto Re
sistance Organization in
 1962 and wanted to 
come  out wi th the first comme moration ever
 of the Wa rsaw Ghetto heroes that we 

couldn't find one Jewish community group or
 one synagogue in the greater New York 
would give us a hall free of
 charge in which to hold the  comme moration.  This was 

before it became  fashionable to attache your
self in more ways than one, socially, 
economically, financially, status wise to th
e word holocaust.  And sooner or later of 
course it is fall into the hands of the esta
blishment or people who have either economic 
ax to grind or want  to enrich themselves 
by publishing this or that.  And that hurts but I 
suppose that is inevitabl e, and so we are the last dying breed because when the war broke 
out I was 11 which means I was old e
nough to reme mber what was going and young 
enough to attain my present age and talk about 
it.  But with my generation when we begin 
dying out that is the end of those who will bear  
witness, and then what hurts is that  it will 
fall into the 18:16:  hands of the interpreters
, the revisionists, even
 the honest revisionists 
who are going to place this or that emphasis be
cause they will have th
eir own ax to grind.  
When you watch a play or a film called Rash
omon when a woma n was violated and there 
were three or four different 
versions of those who were pr
esent.  Each had a different 
version, then you begin to take 
the so called holy scriptures, including the epistles, with a 
grain of salt because unless every word had be
en guided by the spirit of God and that has 
to be proven as I know the scientific for mul
a for approving the spirits.  Whether to what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
52 
 
degree we can trust what will be the witness th
at will be borne, we have fortunately ways 
of recording testimonies which we didn't 
have 2,000 years ago or more, and ma ybe for 
that reason it will be some what better preserve
d.  But what hurts more than anything is 
that what happened to our generation will not be properly understood or  acted upon and 
what hurts even more so is that from what
 I see the world has not learned and the same 

thing 18:18:   is liable to occur again and again.  I don't 
know what else to say. I don't 
want to say empty phrases.  This is a pict
ure about six months old 1927 in Lodz, Poland 
of Joseph Kutrzeba born as Josef Arye Fajwiszy
s about six months old on a bear skin as 
was then a habit of placing infants on.  This
 is my father Professor Israel  Fajwiszys 
approxima tely 1921 in Lwow pre- war Poland, now Ukraine, born in 1887 in Yampol  

which was extreme eastern Poland prior to 1939 
but at the time of his birth was Russia.  
Well, left to right, a chart whose identity I 
don't know because I got these pi ctur es after 

the war, next to him I believe is my father's mother or my grandmother whom I never 
met.  Standing next to her is my mother Ma
lka Fajwiszys, maiden name Hakman, born in 
Czer.....?  Poland.  It was Russia, I believe it wa
s 1902.  Standing next to her is my father 
Professor Israel Fajwiszys and then in the woman's lap is my sister  Perl a age two which 
was about two years before I was planned and next to her I believe was my mother's  

sister or cousin, I'm not sure.  
 

Q: When was this 
picture taken?   
 

A: This picture would have to have been ta
ken in 1925 because my sister was born in 1923 
and she looks about two years old here.  This 
is the foursome  fa mily picture 1937 in Lodz 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
53 
 
Poland, left to right, mys e lf, age about nine
.  Next my sister Pe
rla called by everyone 
Rella, for short.  My mother 
Malka and my father Israel 
Fajwiszys, composer conductor 
among others the best known song all over th
e world, called MIkhol Massada? _-.  I was 
extremely unhappy that day.  I had been cryi
ng for about an hour prior to the picture 
being taken I reme mber, and finally my fath
er had to quiet me down because prior to 
going to the photographer I had been saving m
oney in my little savings box for about a 
year and my parents decided that I needed 
a new sweater and they 
decided to spend all 
my savings on that and I thought it was very unf
air.  This is my elementary school private 
class part of the Jewish gymnasium i n Lodz
, fourth grade if I re
me mb e r  w i t h  t h e  me n  
standing in the back Grevitz, who taught us
 geography and the sign in the back says 
___________, which me ans Silesia in Polish.  Appare
ntly that week he was teaching us 
about ________________, and that's  me  in the cen
ter age about nine.  About 1936, '3 7.  
This was as you can see the lower figures te
n two forty-five, which means the 10th of 
February 1945 almost exactly two months befo
re liberation when I had to go in the city 
of Erfurt_ in Germany to obtain a new identi
ty pa ss because  my old one was stolen and I 
had to go to the Gestapo, actually SD (Sicherh
eitsdienst), which was the security officer 
of the Gestapo to have a new picture taken 
with a number as a Polish catholic ci vilian 
laborer in Ge rmany, age not quite 17 I thi
nk.  A few weeks after my liberation by the 
American troops I was an interpreter with the CIC detachme nt number 220 part of 

Patton's third army already wearing an Americ
an uniform a ge still about 17.  This would 

have been May of 1945.  I am on the extreme right standing by the way.  This was a 

group of us gymnasium kids in the Polish dp 
camp in Altenstadt, summer of 1946 I was 
well 18 I think and myse lf on the extreme right
.  The time is 1948 in Munich in front of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0339  
54 
 
the BMW, yes the people who ma ke the cars
.  The building which was requisitioned by 
the American occupying authorities to hous
e the Polish guard company which was an 
auxiliary military unit which served the U.S. Ar
my in occupation, and this is a revi ew of 
the Polish troops by two American officers, a
nd on the extreme left whic h is the Polish 
commander captain, and I was his adjudant, seco
nd lieutenant.  I'm the next behind him 
in full uniform and white helmet.  This was 
in 1933 the 20th year of
 the activity of my 
father as a conductor was a very festive concer
t in Lodz Philharmonic of my father which 
I believe I ma y have attended.  In fact, I think 
I reme mber that I was 
at age about six.  It 
was a very festive occasion and this is the or
iginal document, the program of that concert 
which has the left side are excerpts of two Or
atoria and then Jewish folk songs all in 
Polish and the right side is in
 Yiddish.  They story very briefly about how the original 
came into my hands was that the Yivo Institut
e, or  the Institute of Jewish culture in 
Eastern Europe had been established in 
the 1920s in Wilno, Poland.  The original 
me mbers of the board wa s Freud and Einstein 
and the inst itute started collecting various 
programs and notices and reviews of Jewish 
culture throughout Poland and the adjacent 
countries.  When the Germans ca me, the contents of the mu seum was confiscated by 
Alfred Rosenberg, who despite the name  was 
a Nazi, not Jew.  He was mi nister of 
occupied territories.  This was taken to a 
Frankfurt, not destroyed for some reason, and 
the American Ar my found it, was perplexed as
 to what to do with it and passed it on to 
the Yivo Jewish Institute in New York and I found this among other papers and reviews 

of my father's concerts 20
 years after the war.
