A: In theAmerican standard, it was a very simp
le house.  Many people were living there because 
after my grandfather -- after re
tiring, everything went.  He had 
businesses, he transferred to 
apartments so ma ny people were living there. Tw
o sisters of my father were living there, one 
with family. We  were living there, my grandf
ather was living there with
 another daughter and 
even many other people. They were small, these were already small apartments.  However, we 

got to about where thes
e people were living ______. 
 

Q: This was like a city building with different apartments? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And your family lived in one of these apartments? 

 
A: Ye s,yes. 
 

Q: So you just ate with your fa mily?  You didn™t

A: I knew everybody because everybody -- as a child I was in the yard always.  It was a bi g yard 
with a garden. 
 

Q: What would you do back in the garden?  Pl ay back there? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber.  Just played with other ch
ildren and so on.  It was nothing special. These 
things are not so interesting.  I was twelve 
years old; then we we
nt to the downtown area 
because it was outside the city, very close to the cemetery. 
 

Q: Your old house was? 

 

A: This old house of grandfather.  His business ne
eded every territory. Therefore it was outside of 
the city.  He used to have horses and wagons 
to transport the beer. This ______ was not in 
boxes.This _____ was in glasses.  It was heavy. 
 

Q: That™s  interesting. Then you moved when you 
were twelve.  So that would be about ---? 
 

A: In downtown Budapest. That was a very nice
 apartment already ..Then, first my father was 
only employee in this pharmacy. Then when the 
owner died, that he wa
s the caret aker  of the 

pharmacy.  Later the widow of the ow
ner saw that it is much better for her if she gives as a lease 
and my father should create a lease and we more 
independent as before. With the help of the 
fa mily, because she was asking a big sum as depos
it for the lease. The whole family helped my 
father to collect this big depos
it, uncles and everybody. Also 
friends, because it was a relatively 
big sum.  It was 40,000 pancs that was in the early thirties. Thirty-four 
or -- because we didn™t 
move until he  had so ma ny debts. When the debts were already, not every single se ttled, but a 

large sum was settled, then we moved. 
 

Q: So he was very excited about --? 

 

A: My mother wanted to move because as I™ve to
ld you this house was a very simple house.  Our 
apartment was rather small and simp le too. Then we moved. 
 

Q: So you lived near the pharmacy whe r e you --? 

 

A: Ye s, yes in downtown.  Ujpest is not a big to
wn.  Even now, it is a subu
rb of Budapest and we 
went -- it was close to the pha
rmacy, yes. Wa lking distance. 
 

Q: Your mother and father continued to work 
in the pharmacy and you and your brother went back 
to school. Di d you walk to school nearby? 
 

A: Ye s, I walked. At that time , everybody walked 
to school.  Now it is a big distance but at that 
time.  My brother had to go back with the stre
etcar because it was in Budapest, it was far away. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther worry about him going so far? 

 
A: No, we had to accept this.  If the fami ly wanted
 him to have a better education, then he had to 
go. 
 
Q: Wa s he a good student? 

 

A: Ye s, yes.  He liked to read too.  I reme mber
 we had to learn and I was reading in on room and 
he was reading in the ot he r and so we couldn™t 
se e each other. We  didn™t want to.  He was a 
rather good student, yes. 
 

Q: Did you get along with him?  

 

A: Yes, I don™t reme mber. 

 

Q: What did he like to do in his fr
ee time, when he wasn™t  studying? 

 

A: He was a boy.  He had a bike.  I had a bike t
oo but he was more concerned with the bike.  He 
had friends and played with the fr
iends.  His best friend, he used to
 live very close to us. They 
went to school together. They went to this hi
gh school in Budapest together because he was a 
Jewish boy too.  He wasn™t  accepted either.  So they were good friends and they were --. 
 

Q: What was his friend™s name ?  

 

A: Ya nnos John Ray R-e-y-i-c-h-e-
r- d.  He was killed too.  I know even the circumstances, I will 

tell you. 
 
Q: You all moved to this house about 
™35 or ™36. It was a new apartment? 

 

A: Ye s,yes. 

 

Q: A larger apartment? 

 

A: A larger apar tment.And then we --. 

 

Q: You had your own room there or di
d you share a room with your brother? 
 

A: When we moved there, then he
 slept in the room of
 my parents and I had a room for myself.  
Then he was older, growing and then he went 
to this room, the children™s room, which was for 
the children.  I was sleeping in the living room on the sofa. 
 

Q: And this apartment had modern conveniences, 
a modern building.  It ha
d electricity and running 
water? 
 

A: Ye s, electricity was in 
the other too but running water

 with your father about your books, would your 
mother listen to your lessons, or --? What would she do in the evenings? 
 

A: Ye s, she was very busy because she he lped my fat her. Then the housekeeping. We  had 
some body who was working in the housekeeping, w
ho was the helping her, but she was busy.  
It was a nice fa mily life.  List
ening to the radio and we had --. 
 

Q: You did have a radio? 

 

A: Ye s, of course. 

 

Q: You followed the news.  Did you get news of 
wha t  was happening in Germany in the thirties? 
 

A: Ye s,yes. 

 

Q: Do you remember that? 

 

A: My father used to listen to the English 
radio every evening. That was very common i n 
Hungary.  People used to listen to it.  I reme mb
e r  once we too listened to the Russian radio and 
they spoke aboutAuschwitz and th
ings like that. That was in th
e early forties already.  My 
father who was a great huma nist thought
 he can™t  believe it.  It is --. 
 

Q: Your father was a communist? 

 

A: No, he was a humanist, 
 
Q: Oh, a huma nist. 

 

A: He thought he can™t  believe it, 
that such a thing as these camps
 can exist. We  are in the 20
th
 
century. 
 

Q: What camps  did he hear about?   I™m sorry I didn™t --? 

 

Aﬂ It wasAuschwitz about what 
we heard in the Russian radio. 
 

Q: It was on the radio? 

 

A: In the Russian broadcasting, it was. The 
Russians knew everything aboutAuschwitz. They 
knew it perfectly. When they bombe dAuschwitz, they bombed the SS largenren, not where the 

Jews were.  I reme mber --. 
 

Q: That was much later. 

 

A: That was later, that was when I was there al
ready. That was in ™44, ™45, ™44 in December. 
 

Q: But when you were in Ujpest in the late 
thirties, say 1938, 1939; ther
e was a new right-wing 
prime mi nister who came  to power in Hungary
. That was later, I told you, these radio 
broadcasts what we heard. That was in th
e fort ies, I t hi nk it  
was in ™42 or ™43. 
 

Q: What was there anything going on in the late 1930™
s, in the other countries
?  After Kristallnacht, 
the atmosphere really deteriorated very rapidl
y. You did not have Kristallnacht in Hungary. 
 

A: No, in Hungary was nothing. There were these re
strictions but they were not so bad. You could 
live with these rest rictions. 
 

Q: What sort of restrictions? 

 

A: What I me nt ioned already. That you can™t  enter a university and you can™t -- my father couldn™t 
buy a pharmacy.  It was not allowed for a Jew to buy a pharmacy.  He could only lease a 

pharmacy and the owner knew it very well and ever
y year he asked more and more for the --. 
 

Q: That was a very old law.  I 
think that that dated from the 1920™s,
 that law about the professions. 
It wasn™t  some thing th
at just happened --. 
 

A: It was more restrictions came.  Like the time
, the old law was not so very, the old law allowed 
6% for the university, 6% Jews can enter the unive
rsity, as I reme mber, or even more. The old 
law -- there were restrictions but 
they were not so strict. At l
east every Jewish law, it became -- 
[Male voice: ﬁThere wasn™t  no law against Jews in th
e twenties.  Just they hate the Jews so that 
no ma tter _____ work but there was no opposition, not 
in the Parliame nt. This was the first in 
™39 when they brought this law.ﬂ] 
 

Q: The second anti-Jewish law? 

 

A: [ ﬁThe first anti-Jewish law.ﬂ] 
 

Q: There were two laws? 

 

A: [ﬁYe s, in ™39 and on May 14
th
, the second.  But one thing what
 they speak up in the twenties 
here, there was no law against the Je wsﬂ]. 
 

Q: Oh, it was just a policy? 

 

A: [ﬁ Just a policy, just a policyﬂ]. 

 

Q: So it got much harder with these new anti-J
ewish laws to enter the university?  A lot of 
Hungarians went to other --Vi enna or? 
 

A: Jews?   Not toVi enna, it was very difficult. Th
ey went to Italy or to 
Czechoslovakia.  In Bruno 
it was a German university and ma ny Hungarian engineers 
started there. 
 

Q: There were also laws rest ric
ting what Jews could sell? Like ce
rtai n items that they coul dn™t sell 
any more?  Did that have impact on --? 
 

A: No, that was later.  In the thirties, such a thing di dn™t  exist. 

 

Q: There was just -- that your father couldn™t buy 
the store which was probably a very big thing for 
him, that he probably referred to. 
 

Q: Not just this pharmacy, any store. Any pharm
acies, not stor es, pharmacy.  It is a different 
categor y. 
 

Q: It™s like a professional categor
y.  But there were no other rest
rictions that you can reme mber 
that affected your lives? 
 

A: No, no, as children. 

 

Q: So then you graduated from high school in 1942?  
You said you went to a girls™ high school.  It 
wasn™t  a Jewish high school? 
 

A: No, it was a state-owned high school. 

 

Q: So you had non-Jewish friends? 

 

A: In this class, we graduated 
twenty-six. Among the tw
enty-six girls, five 
or six were Jewish. 
From the six, three gr aduated excellent. 
 

Q: So, in 1942, you graduated and you went to work in the pharmacy?  

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And you helped your parents in the pharmacy
?  And then your life continued until 1941? 
 

A: Ye s,yes. 
 

Q: Do you want to talk about that? 

 

A: I worked.  I liked this work very mu ch.  I had a 
very full life. We  went to concerts, to theaters 
with my fr iends. That was a regular life then. 
 

Q: Did you have boy friends? 

 

A: Oh, he was in the labor camp. When -- in th
is forced labor camp and -- but we hoped that he 
will survive. 
 

Q: When did he go into the forced labor camp?  

 

A: In ™40 but he was around in Hungary and he ca
me often home.  He could come home for a short 
visit and so on but he was there. Then it was 
in ™42, September, when he had to go to Russia 
with this forced labor camp.  He disappeared
 when at ______ nesh when the Hungarian army 
was destroyed by the Russians.  It wa s ™42, Janu
ary.  He disappeared then and we don™t know 
anything about him but it was still a hope that
 he will survive ma ybe, somehow in Russia. 
 

Q: There were a lot of young me n w
ho s e nt to forced labor in 1940? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: That was the period when 
there was a general call up? 
 
A: Ye s,yes. 
 

Q: Men between the ages of 18 and 42, I think? 

 

A: Ye s, that was that period.  Many Hungarian, 
the Christian went to the army and the Jewish 
people went to the forced labor camp. 
 

Q: In May of 1944, the Germans invaded ___. 

 

A: Not May, that was March, March. 

 

Q: March 19, right?  We re there Germans in Ujpest? 

 

A: Everywhere there were Germans, in the w
hole country. They invaded the whole country. 
 

Q: What do you reme mber of the invasion? 

 

A: It was a Sunday when they came. We  were
 frightened, very frightened, yes.  From that 
mome nt, every day and every week, 
the life was getting harder a
nd harder until this deportation 
started. 
 

Q: Te ll me  wha t  happened leading up to the deportation. We re you moved fr om your house? 

 

A: Ye s, we had to leave this apartment. We  went to
 live to the house of this
 friend of my brother.  
They were a _______ from her house and it was a fa m
ily house.  First we were forced to live 
there two-family; then more and more fa milie
s. At the end, before the de portation, I don™t 
know we we re living there ma ybe twenty or twenty
- four people were already living in this one 
apartment.  It was a fami ly house. 
 
Q: Why were you forced to move in there? 

 

A: To gave up --. They thought that this --. In 
our apartment they moved in the old Jewish people.  
It became  Œ it was complicated, the whole situatio
n. We  passed by in Budapest later, there were 
houses ma rked with David St ar. The house where we used to live was un over these ma rked 

houses.  It seemed more  better ever the choice to
 go to live with these fr
iends in this family 
house as to live in this
 relatively big house. 
 

Q: Wa s your friend™s house ma rked also? 

 

A: Ye s, it was ma rked also. Then the marked 
houses were getting fewer and fewer and we were 
collecting people with more and more deaths. 
 I don™t know exactly how ma ny people were in 
these relatively small fam
ily houses at the end. 
 

Q: When you were able to leave the 
house during the daytime to go out --? 
 

A: Only, at first we were able, then it was restri
cted for three hours at th
e end and so on, then to 
ma ke some  shopping, I don™t know what.  In the 
last three days, you c
ouldn™t leave the house 
anymore. 
 
Q: Do you want to talk about that?  Wh at
 it was like for the 
people in the house? 
 
A: I thought I ha d life because -- not even one fa mily had a room in this house. We  were sleeping 
with different people. I ate a
ll the marmalades which my mot her _______ had with us.  I was 
never so fat in my life as beforeAuschwitz.  Maybe that was my chance. 
 

Q: So you were there with your mother, your father and your brother? 

 

A: The family was there. 

 

Q: What about the grandparents, 
your grandfather, wa s he there? 
 

A: I told you, he was dead when I was seven years old.

A: Ye s, they were all friends. 

 

Q: Did you have any idea what was going to happen to you? 

 

A: No, these letters came  fr omVa lsay because we knew that from the countryside. They started 
with sn_____.  From the  countryside, the Jews were taken away. That we heard for the end.  

Then they came  --. 

 
Q: You said the letter came  from your mother ™s --? 

 

A: No, no. We  heard that some  people wrote letters 
to relatives. We  didn™t get any like that.  But 
some  people got letters from relatives who were 
taken away and they have written that we are 
here inVa lsay and we are working.  But you neve
r heard this name  ofVa l say?   Because that 
wasAuschwitz already. The people we
re forced to write these letters. 
 

Q: They wrote that 
from Auschwitz?    
 

A: They wrote, yes. They were fo
rced.  It was not letter
s, it was cards.  It wa
s cards and they were 
forced to write to friends and relatives who 
are still in Budapest or some where in the 
countryside, that we are here a
nd we are working and everything is
 okay with us. These letters, 
I™ve heard it about these postcards. That was 
the only thing what we knew.  Later, in 
Auschwitz, I heard --. 
 

Q: Ta lk about leaving your building. 

 

A: Then, it was just before the birt
hday of my mother.  It was the 28
th
 of June that, do you know 
what this Hungarian junta (??)
 mean, have you ever heard it? 
 

Q: Hungarian--? 

 

A: Hungarian junta.  Before every Jewish ho
liday, before every ma rked house was standing a 
gendarme that you couldn™t  leave and nobody could 
enter the house. Three days they were 
standing there in the streets of 
_______ and after --. We  told that
 we should prepare for leaving 
the house and we can take with us only a veryfew things.  Some  clothi
ng and nothing special, 
no jewel, no food. 
 

Q: Nofood?  

 

A: Ve ry, very -- just a small some thing to eat but 
not too much. After three days we had to leave; 
we had to leave, we had to go. They collected 
all the Jewish people from Ujpest and from the 
suburbs of Budapest because Budapest was enco
untered with small suburbs. They took all the 
Jews from the suburbs.All the Jews were collected 
in a brick factory just 
outside of Budapest or 
very close to Budapest. Budakalow.
 That™s the name  of the village.  It belongs to Budapest 
now. No, it exists even today.  Everybody 
was collected in this brick factory. 
 

Q: How were you taken there?  
We re you driven in trucks? 
 

A: By the train. We  had to go to the st
ation of Ujpest which is a very small one. 
 

Q: Did you walk there? 

 

A: Wa lked.We  saw the luggages through the whole 
town.  It is a very long road which was called 
after the war, Marketopoola because of this 
ma rch. As I know the Hungarian people, they 

changed it. 
 

Q: How long was it? A kilome ter or --? 

 
A: Some thing like that. Th
e street of the Marchers. 

 

Q: So your fa mily was still all together. 
All four of you were still all together? 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Your father had not; he was 
too old for forced labor, or --? 
 

A: He was not too old but he  was exempt.  He 
got an exemption because Hungary had, not Ujpest 
had, the chief physician of the town who was re
sponsible for the town, he was a very good ma n 
and a leftist.  He told that every pharmacist mu
st be exempt.  So my father came back from the 
labor camp.  Because the pharmacy must be open, he told that, become  ________, the 

pharmacist. 
 

 

Q: How long was he in the labor camp? 

 

A: Maybesixweeks. 

 

Q: Do you know the name  of the camp th
at he went to or where it was at? 
 

A: It was just very close to the town, very clos
e to Ujpest and to Buda
pest.  Never mi nd. I don™t 
r e me mb e r.  
 

Q: What did he do there? 
 
A: Nothing.  It was just a camp for collecting people. 

 

Q: He didn™t work? 

 

A: I don™t think so.  Probably he
 was only four weeks there. 
 

Q: In1940? 

 

A: In 1940.  No, later, later. Th
at was later.  It was 1941 or so
me thing like that. Then he was 
exempt. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther run the pharmacy while he was gone? 

 

A: No, no. We  had help in the pharmacy.  My mothe r  couldn™t run a pharmacy because she had no 
degree. We  had some body, an empl oyee.  Later 
this employee had to go to the army and then 
father was alone. 
 

Q: So, you™re going to the railroad station to go to the brickyard? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: How long were you on this train? 

 
A: That was only some  hours. That was very clos
e to Budapest.  It takes twenty mi nutes to go 
there. We were several hours ther e but it is so 
close to Budapest. Then we went there and we 

stayed there for a week. That was the hell of ev
erything, this brick factor y, because we were in 
the open air, nothing was there, no facilities, not
hing.  One or two wells 
for water, that was 
drinking water and everything. You couldn™t wash
 yourself, you had to sleep on the earth.  If 
you had some blanket, then you were lucky. As
 I reme mber, we had some blankets but it was 
summer and it was no rain, but that 
was the hell of everything. Th
en they started to make the 
convoys, or how to call it, the groups to
Auschwitz. The Germans ca me  - - . 
 

Q: TheywereGermans?  

 

A: They were Germans, together 
with the Hungarians.  Germans. 
 

Q: TheSS? 

 

A: Ye s, I think so. Then they put people in these wagons. 

 

Q: We re you and all your family still toge ther? 

 

A: Ye s, yes. We  were in the la
st group who left this and it was the 
last transport. We  lasted three 
or four days. This one bucket, it was two buc
kets.  One bucket for water, one bucket for the 
_____. You could empty ma ybe two or three time s, 
these buckets; we were all cramped in. As 
it was the last transport,
 it was not so crowded, these wagons, 
as usual, because there we re not 
so ma ny people -- already dead. We  were only 
70 or 80, not more but that was much too.  I 

reme mber that my father told me during the firs
t night, we were sitting 
so, that I never thought 
that your first journe y abroad will be  like this.  
Because that was my first journe y abroad.  I was 
in my twenties. 
 

Q: We re you all still well when you were on the ca
rs or were you sick or were you still we ll? 
 

A: No, I was still well. 

 

Q: And your parents were still well? 

 

A: Ye s, everybody was. 

 

Q: You had some  food to eat? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber.  Maybe we had some thing to 
eat.  I reme mber that we got some thing to eat 
through this week; that a neighbor brought us 
some thing to eat.  From Budapest, some body 
brought some food for us. 
 

Q: Really, to the brickyard? 

 

A: To the brickyard.  He was not allowe
d to come  in but some how he got in. 
 

Q: AChristian? 

 

A: A Christian, yes.  For us and for the Reyicherds. 
We  were together with this family, a friend of 
my brother and with his parents untilAuschwitz. 
 But his parents were older, more older; he 
was a late child. They were sick people; they 
were fat and sick. They never entered the camp.  
He entered so they were, you know how it was. 
 
Q: Do you want to talk any mo
re about the train or --? 
 

A: The train was awful, as I told you.  Maybe, even
 at Kasha.  Of course, at that time  it was 
Hungary but after the Fi rstWorld, it was Slovakia 
and it is Slovakia even today. A Hungarian 
gendarme came to the wagon and told we should gi
ve everything we have 
then, I think it was a 
private business that we should give everything 
which we have from Ladaad or if we have 
anything, wa ter, some body had nothing. Anyhow, the German will take everythi ng from us and 

we should give it to him. That was 
the last Hungarian I have spoken with. 
 

Q: Did you give him anything? 

 

A: No, we had nothing. 

 

Q: Where did you get the photos?   How did you save the photos? 

 

A: From friends or from relatives.  It wa
s not with us -- I got it from relatives. 
 

Q: You had nothing with you? 

 

A: Nothing with us. We  had some  baskets w
ith us.  Everybody had a small luggage.  Nothing 
interesting. 
 

Q: No books or --? 

 

A: No. They didn™t allow to take.  In this ap
artment in Ujpest, they 
checked everything what you 
take.   If it was a better thing, or some thi
ng, you are just not allowed to take it with you.  
 

Q: So you arrived atAuschwitz.  Did you know you were inAuschwitz? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Wa s there a sign or anything? 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: You didn™t know where you were when you stopped? 

 

A: No, no. We  learned it very soon where we are.
  But the name  didn™t tell us anything yet.  
Because Jewish people were working at the train as
 well. Then it was this selection.  My whole 
fa mily went into the -- father, brother were toge
ther and I was together with my mother. We  
entered camp.  
 

Q: None of you were selected out? 

 

A: We  were not selected out. 
 

Q: But there were a lot of people, the older ones 
and the babies we re imme diately selected.They 
never entered the camp? 
 

A: They never entered.  I have to tell you that was 
my first, that is even today, one of my worst 
me mories. That we were all already -- Everybody ha
d to bathe, to take a 
bath, that it was worth 
that or it was the gas.  Everybody had to take ev
erything off and even the hair was cut. We  

were already without anything. Then the German 
people were there; they
 realized that there 
was a girl with an orthopedic shoe.  So one leg 
was shorter than the other. They took and they 

realized when she was naked. They took the naked girl out and took her away, naked as she 

was, because of the foot.  Now, I know, later I kn
ow that she was taken to the other room to be 
killed.  Because they realized
 that only when she was naked. 
 

Q: Did you know this girl? 

 

A: No, no.  Only I reme mbe r  the whole story.  I ha
ve seen the whole story. At that time, I didn™t 
understand, of course, what was happening.  But I 
have the whole picture in my eyes.  She was 
taken naked and killed. 
 

Q: She was, how old? 

 

A: Eighteen. A nice young girl. At th
at time, I used to have very b
eautiful hair.  It was more light 
than now; it was a very ni ce color.  Now, it is ge
tting dark with age but you saw ---.  It was fair 
and a bit reddish.  My mother was very proud of 
it and when they cut my hair, she just thought, 
oh your beautiful hair!  I reme mber. Then we ente
red this thing and then we me t the girls from 
Czechoslovakia who were there already three years.
  Only a few of the m rema ined alive after 
three years and they were the ka
pos, not kapo, lageraltester. They
 were who ruled the barrack.  
Lageraltester that  was the 
end of the whole lager. 
 

Q: They were Jewish? 

 

A: They were Jewish.  Every barrack had a head. 
 La geraltester, that was the German na me . They 
were these Czechoslovakian girls. They were
 telling us just at the beginning, do you see the 
smoke there?  That is your relati
ves, your parents.  I didn™t wa nt 
to believe it.  I was a huma nist 
like my father.  I reme mbered that we  had a dead person in our wagon already when we arrived 

toAuschwitz.  I told my moth
er, they are so, I™m sure ma ny people were dead during this long 
journey. Therefore the crematorium is running becau
se they have to get rid of the dead people.  
I didn™t believe that they were killing the peopl
e.  But later on, very soon, I knew they were 
right. 
 

Q: Your father and brother had gone 
into a different part of the camp?  
 

A: Ye s, because  me n were separated and wome n we
re separated.  So I was together with my 
mother. 
 

Q: Did you see your brothe
r and father again? 
 

A: I have seen my father once with some  others. 
What we did with this lager where we go. That 

was, in Birkenau,Auschwitz is the main lager 
and we can now six kilome ters away. When the 
Hungarian people came, these last transports
 of this brick factory, it was called the 

sigarnalaager, gypsy lager. The number of the la
ger was called 32C.  Later, I learned that the 
gypsy people were living there with fa mily.  It was 
a family lager. They killed them before the 
Hungarian Jews were brought there because they 
needed the place. Ve ry few gypsies who were 
inAuschwitz survivedAuschwitz.  Most of them 
were killed at that  time. We came there and 
the second day or the third day, we were newcomer
s. We  were very stupid. We  didn™t know the 
regulations.  For instance, we got some  bread.  
Then people were comi ng and telling if you give 
me  a piece of bread, I give you this pot and you 
can eat from this pot.  One of my friends 
bought a pot to have a pot from barrack.  Later on
 came, not the Germans, Port, ‚toot™ and then 
came another one and took it away because it was 
not allowed to have the pot. The pots were 
distributed before getting the food and then it was collected again. You couldn™t own a pot and 

the people who sold the pot for 
bread knew it but she was hungry. 
 Morika, that was Morika.  
We  were stupid and I don™t know, some how, they
 arranged a transport fromYa ngers and we 
were standing there and one 
person was mi ssing.  I think on
e person was running away from 
this transport and they needed some body. We  we
re standing there with mother and they just 
took me  and pushed me  in this transport and we we
re separated.  If I were not so stupid, some  
days later, I would run away again but I didn™
t run away. That was the transport, I was 
separated from mother. Then they took us to th
e next lager, took we to be which had only the 
wire, which was separated with this el ectrica l wi
re from the other one where mother rema ined.  
I was there.  I sleep and I heard 
they wanted to send for work, thes
e transports.  But it turned out 
that some body had scarlet.  Scarlet fe ver from
 these transports.  So
 they stopped all the 
transports and we had to rema in there.  So moth
er was here and I was there.  I could speak to 
her.  It was not so easy but I have spoken to 
her every day, but in the very early morning 

because there were these towers inAuschwitz an
d in every tower was a German, an SS.  If he 
thought that at the wire, there are 
too ma ny peopl e, he shot.  I have seen with my eye s  two girls 
who were shot.  One was speaking with her si
ster who was on the other side and one was 
speaking with her mother.  I have seen two girls who were shot. 
 

Q: It was risky? 

 

A: It was ri sky.  So I told mother, I will come 
only in the very early morning when he is still 
sleeping and not awake.We  spoke every day.  In
 this ____, to me  it was better because this was 
people whom they wanted to go to work. The circ
umstances were better here than with mother 
and I had more to eat and I could give to mother some thing to eat. 
 

Q: What was your mother doing? 

 

A: Nothing, very few people were working. We  didn™t

ma de the cleaning. They were big barracks as
 restrooms.  I don™t know how _______ sees that, 
not sees, look, pause. Clean the la

everything of the block, 
that was a job for me .  
If some body is ill, because in these -- there wa

should take her to the doctor 
and so on. I got some  medication. 
 It was ma inly aspirin.  If 
some body needs aspirin, I should give her.  I got 
from this doctor, some thing. They liked me  
very much, these doctors.  I reme mbe r  that.  I real
ized that if I give aspi

will sell it for bread. Then I told he r if you need
 aspirin, br ing a glass of water or  something 
and you have to take it before me .  I would have 
give anything for bread,

on.  But they didn™t succeed.  I have seen it 
because it was so that; there were
 pe ople in the block who had to

crematorium. They were so, it was so unexpected
 that they were just 
taken aback in running, do 
you understand me ?  
 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: It turned out that this 
was the revolution of the Sonderkommando. They could recollect

erybody, including the girl.

_____ communication, how to tell it. ______.The girl 

was taken and she was killed too and nobody could es
cape. That™s  it, what

how to tell it, that when they 
brought new transport with the train, then it wa
s blockspera, it means that you couldn™t leave 
the barrack where you were. You had to stay ther

reme mber when they brought new people.  For inst
ance, from Slovakia, they first, as I™ve told 
you, only the girls were taken away. 
The unma rried girls.  For inst
ance, one, a cousin of mi ne 
who used to live there wa s taken because she wa
s unmarried but two others who were ma rried 
could stay there. They were taken later on 
in September from Slovakia toAuschwitz.  I 
reme mber when they brought this transport,
 when the transport was coming and how few 
people could enter the lager.  Maybe, I don™t kn
ow how ma ny they brought
. After my mother, 
because a sister of my mother us
ed to live inYe etro and the whol
e family.  I told mother that 
they were brought, I have spoken to people who en
tered the lager and so I knew that they were 

taken and that nobody among them, entered the lager. 
 I remember that I told mother that your 
sister came and her fami ly, her two daughter
s and husbands, and grandchildren and nobody 
entered the lager.

later people. Then in autumn, I don™t know wh
en they began to emptyAuschwitz. They 
wanted to evacuate. They destroyed in the 
late -- that was later, they destroyed the 
crematoriums.  Only one is left.  In the men™s la
ger in the fall.  Because in Birkenu there were 

four crematoriums. The y were not enough. They 
destroyed all the four crematoriums  but that 
was later.  But they began to evacuate.  In Octo
ber, they took my mother from this ____lager.  I 
reme mber it was this blocksperen this closed th
ing but I was so nervous because of the mother 
and I wanted to know what happens because
 it wa s a big selection. Who were found good 
enough, they were taken away and I was told that
 they will bring them to ___lager but that 
wasn™t  true. Who were not heal
thy enough, they were killed.  I re
me mb er it was October, it was 
Nocterine; the day was not yet cold, it was a nice da
y.  I was sitting in a hole all the day.  From 
there I could see what happens in the C-lager where the mother was. 
 

Q: You were hiding in a hole? 
 
 

A: Ye s, because  I was so anxious to see what will happen to my mother.  I wanted to see what 
happens.  I couldn™t see much but 
it was a better feeling to sit in
 this hole. Then they took 
mother and she was taken to Bergen-Belsen that I knew. 
 

Q: How did you know that? 

 

A: She was not there any more.  Maybe I have s
poken to some body who knew her but I knew that.  
Before she was taken away, I have forgotten to te
ll you that it was a trans
port and all my friends 
went with this transport from our block, ev
erybody was taken to work.  Some  back to 
Czechoslovakia, I learned later. 
 I was starting with them, I went
, every transport was the same  -
- that you had to go to the ma in scrag of the lage
r and then they selected you and from then you 
were taken away.  I went with them to this place. 
Then I felt that I can™t go away; the mother is 
here.  I can give her food, I can
 see her, I can™t leave my mo th
er here and I just escaped and 
went back.  I didn™t went to the transport. Th
en I was smart then, at that time I was smart 

enough, I knew that nothi ng will happen. When the number is filled, they will take the 

transpor t and finished. 
 
Q: They won™t mi ss you?  

 

A: They won™t mi ss me .  In the evening, I told my mother I couldn™t go away.  I rema in here.  
Somebody was with my  mother and other mother 
who had three daughters in the group.  She 

ask me  do you know anything about my
 three girls?   I told her yes,  they went.  She said, oh they 
left me  here. To tell the truth, they were smart.
  Later it turned out, when I was at home , it was 
years and years after, I met a girl
, I met a girl with whom I slept 
under one blanket.  She told me  
that this transport was already 
good. They went to a small town some where in Czechoslovakia.  
They worked in a factory. The work itself was not too hard. The people in these small towns 

were very helpful. They gave them food when
e ver they could.  Only one person died. It was 
six hundred people and only one died, one of them
 with natural -- some thing happened to her.  
That was not a bad trip. All the others came back. 
 

Q: Do you know what they were ma king in the factory? 

 

A: I don™t know exactly.  I was not so
 interested in that kind of fact
ory.  It was ma ybe a textile or 
some thing.  She worked inTunsaran.  She was from Budapest but she worked inTunsaran and 

so she was as the sister of your friend..  So she 
was taken away.  It was 
not allowed to commute, 
the Jewish people couldn™t  commute . They were exempt, they saw they are exempt and they 

worked inTunsaran and they used to leav
e that. Then the German took everybody who was 
working inTunsaran. Tunsaran is a big factor
y which exists even now in Hungary. The bulbs, 
they are ma king bulbs and --. 
 

Q: Oh, light bulbs. 
 
A: Ye s and it wa s a very important thing and th
e first Jewish people who worked there were 
exempt. They can stay there and work. 
 

Q: This was in Budapest? 

 

A: It was Ujpest, the suburb.  So that is that.  It
 is one of the biggest f
actories in Hungary.  So I 
couldn™t go away and some  weeks later, mother 
was taken away.  I told myself, now it is no 
reason to stay here any more and I go away with
 the next transport.Th
e next transpor t where I 
went, which was chosen, went from one part of th
e lager to the other part. That was the whole 
transport.  It was the oldest part and all 
the circumstances were much wor se.  It was 
Ausenkommando, I told you, we had to work. We  
had to dig potatoes in the pun ____. We  had 
to put potatoes  in heaps and cover with eart
h.  It was raining, ev
erythi ng was wet; all the 
potatoes got rotten.  One day we were -- and it 
was a very heavy work because you had to carry 

it across; it was a hard work. Y
ou had to carry the potatoes.  On
e day it was put there, the other 
day we had to remove them from there.  It was 
silly work only it was very, very difficult, very 
hard work.  In this potato, I got ill very s
oon.  I was not so strong any more.  I never was a 

strong person and I got ill.  In the me antime, 
the evacuation of the camp was continued and we 
were taken fr om this old part of this lager back 
to where I used to be, back to this relatively new 
part, this B2B where I have known 
all the physicians. Them I felt i
ll and I was ill and I sent to 
these physicians whom I  knew and they put me
 in this rever _____, you know what a rever ___ 

is, it was a small hospital where ill people could stay
 as long as they were 
not selected. At that 
time, the selection was not as bad any more. Af
ter they knew the crematorium didn™t work.  I 

hoped that ma ybe if I c a n regain force and if 
I go to the rev ___ that was in the rev ___ you 
didn™t have to stay this active (?
) because that was awful, to stay and stay and it was cold and it 
was dark in the evening. What happened to 
me  during this potato work --one day we had 
blocksperesh where we had to stay in the barrack. 
We had to come back from the potato field to 
stay in the barrack.  I had one only ____ to slee
p, underwear.  I hated it,
 you can imagine.  I 
hated it, it was so --.  I have worn it day and 
day and day after this on
e only thing. We  were 
there and I thought -- I washed it 
and it was wet. We  went to 
sleep and the wet underwear was 
some where there.  It was stole
n.  So it was November and I ha
d to stay the opel and I had no 
underwear.  Even today, I am very sensitive.  I 
got cold, you notice, the weather and even today 
I suffer with it. Then, it was some da ys I was 
walking without this underw
ear and then we went 
some where there was a bath, where there was wa
rm water and you could take a bath, there and 
some how there, we ma nages to buy for me , I was w
ith a friend together -- I always looked for a 
friend to have some body, not to be alone -- and 
this was a very good friend of mi ne. We  went 
there and we bought for a bread because we had, in 
this work, in this potato work, we got more 
bread than usual. We  ha d bread and we bought for me  underwear, warm underwear for one 

bread. We  put together our -- and then I had it. I reme mber it was such a cold, I got such a bad 

cold, because to stay out as long without underw
ear, that I had diarrhea and I had to urinate 
always, I was really ill.  It wa
s while we were standing in the 
opel and I found that I must go up.  
I told Markget, I™ll sit down and 
I™ll ma nage my work.  She began to cry, Eva don™t do it.  If the 
German will see you, what you are doing, she 
will kill you.  She will hi
t you, beat you until you 
are dead.  I told her, I can™t help, I must.  I ha
d the chance, I was not seen
.  It was dark already 
and so I coul d manage it.  I felt that I must do it because ot herwise -- it was stupidity because 

standing is possible --but I 
hated it. To get dirty. 
 

Q: It sounds horrible. Y
ou stayed inAuschwitz --? 
 
A: Yes, then I -- I mi ssed the schedule because th
at was during this potato work, all these things 
that we bought for me  t he underwear and that we 
had to stand. What I thought then, decided to 
ever ___ this old part of the lager and we went back to this B2B which was one of the best parts 
of the lager. Then the physicians who knew me  t
ook me  to the revier, to 
the small hospital.  But 
I mi ssed you a very important -- I mi ssed a very im
portant detail of the po
tato.  In this potato 
field, we worked together, Ukrainian girls who 
we re from the countryside, who were big and 

strong and for whom this work was nothing special. We  used to live in the same  block together 

with them. They were very, very rude with us
.  In the morning they took -- inAuschwitz you 
are not allowed to drink water, there is no drin
king there, ma ny people died because they drank 

this water and typhus, I don™t know 
what and died in diarrhea.  
They took the -- in the morning 
they brought tea.  It was not tea but it was some th
ing but it was boiled water.They took this hot 

water and they washed themselves in it. We  
rema ined, we didn™t get anything to drink in the 
morning, so they were so rude. We  had to go to 
the kitchen and steal tea which is a stupidity to 

steal boiled water but we  had to drink some thing.  
If the German see us, that we are stealing the 
tea from the kitchen, it would be a bad story.  
We  had to do it because we knew we have to 
drink and we  are not allowed to drink the water. 
That was our drink for the whole day. Then 
they carried a big -- thes
e Ukrainian girls , they were strong 
-- and they carried ma ny potatoes.  
We  can™t  keep up with potatoes in this carriage.
  She told the German 
officer, look, the Jew has 
so few potatoes and I am carrying so much. We
 managed to escape somehow from the German 
that she couldn™t observe that we
 are carrying a few, only on the 
bottom of this thing.  But she 
told the German, look what they are doing. Then 
we got hit. We  were beaten, They were 

really very, very -- [ﬁSo they were not Jewish
ﬂ] No, no. The y were from the countryside.  I 

can™t  help but these are my me mories from the Uk
rainian girls.  
They were even worse than the 

Germans wi th us.That was the end of my work
ing career inAuschwitz, when I got to this 
revier.  I don™t  know why, I could do 
eel and eel.  I couldn™t recall why. 
 
Q: It™s  still 1944?   

 

A: That was 1944, that was Nove mber, late Novemb
er already.  InAusc
hwitz, there were two 
reviers for ill people, not two pa
rts, two sections.  One was the 
E section for wome n, it was only 
one and F section for me n.  In the small revier, 
in B2B, they couldn™t help me  and if you are 

more serious ill, you had to be taken to this E s
ection.  I was taken to th
is E section and later I 
me t one girl of Ujpest, of my town, saw me  when
 I was taken to the E section -- not alone, with 
several people.  She told me later in Ujpest, I wa
s sure that you are taken to be killed.  I never 
thought that we will again meet 
each other here in our town because I was so upset and I was 
sure that you were taken away to be killed [ﬁ Wh
o? ﬂ] I tell you later. 
I don™t  know only the name  
but several times I have met her in Ujpest.  I 
was taken to this E sect
or and that was ma ybe 
December already.  In January, 18
th
 of January, and I was bad, and I had malaria because I had 
temperature; the temperature rose suddenly disapp
eared.  I had four or fi
ve of these and I was 
again without a temperature.  I was there with many 
other people.  It is January.  It was told that 
everybody who can run, who can walk have to go a
nd to leave the camp. A transport will go 
and it was told that there are no trains, you ha
ve to walk. All my clothing was ___ wrong, it 
was greenish, some thing green and the ve
ry same one and a pair of shoes. 
 

Q: That™s  all you had? 

 

A: That™s all what I had. 

 

Q: A dress and a pair of shoes? 
 
A: When you get ill, they
 take all your dresses. 
 

Q: Oh, so you just had the gown, the nightshirt? 

 

A: Nightshirt and a pair of shoes.  But then 
we ma naged some  and everybody in the revier had 
clothing.  But some how, we ma naged to get clothes. 
Then it was not the strict order anymore.  
My friends brought me  some  clothes.  It was a co
at and a Jacket.  I got some  clothes. Then it 
was a full day, everybody got a lo
af of bread and it was told th
at everybody who can walk must 
go. Then we were some  young girls and we deci
ded not to go. We  thought we are not strong 
enough, we cannot walk. They will kill us if we can™t  walk. The only chance to survive is to 

stay here and to see what will ha ppen. That™s th
e only chance.  If we go, we are sure that we 
will be killed. We were maybe fi ve girls. We d
ecided to stay and we will see at that time, we 
had the clothes ___ and we will s
ee what will happen.  I remember it was a girl there from the 
first group whom I knew from the first group when I was first time in the B™s, 2B, and she was 

rather ill.  She wanted to go and she decided to
 go.  I told he r but you are ill, you can™t walk.  
But I want to be alive -- that 
was her answer.  It wa s so funny
, I didn™t answer anything but it 
was that I wa nt to be alive as well. Therefore,
 I want to stay here a
nd she went.  I don™t  know 
what happened to her but it was so striking to me , I 
want to be alive. That was her answer. We  
stayed there and we were there more than one week alone. 
 

Q: Just the five of you? 

 

A: No, two thousand, seven hundred, I don™t know how ma ny, ill people.  Everybody was ill and 
sick.  Of course, there were other people who had 
the same  idea then.  It was a big battle,  very 
close toAuschwitz, a big battle, where Res ___ is, very
 close. At the river, was a big battle.  It 
lasted two days.  It was on the 27
th
, we have seen and we have h
eard the battle. That was our 
chance. We  had no electricity 
in the camp and we had no water.  It was ____  ____ in the case 
of fire, this water, because th
ere was running water in the cam
p.  It was not anymore running.  
We  had fuel, we had coal to heat, we could he
at the barrack.  Many peopl
e died during these ten 
days.  Because all of them were ill pe ople w
ho stayed ther e; so me  of them were well. 
 
Q: You didn™t have very much to eat? 

 

A: We  had this bread and then some how, people ma
naged to get from the storage, some  food.  I 
reme mber we got beans and we cooked it 24 hours in th
is fire.  It never got soft, but we ate it.  It 
was so old that it -- we just wa
nted to cook it in water. We  
had some thing to eat. ______ was a 
big thing.  On the 27
th
 when the cannon, in the morning ever
ything it was silence, stopped, the 
cannon stopped and everything stopped. At noon, the 
first Russian soldiers arrived to the camp.  
They were wearing this white gow
n, it was winter. At twelve o™cl
ock, I went to bring some  coal 
to heat this, because it was a long, long oven along 
the whole barrack which could be  heated.  It 
was not warm but it was not ice co
ld in the barrack and we could 
heat it some  of. We  went to 
bring fuel and then we have s
een the first two soldiers who we
re comi ng. That was the first 
camp where they found living people.  People w
ho were alive. They passed already, the 
Russian army, passed alreadyTr eblinka and Majd
anek and nobody was there alive.  It turned 
our thatAuschwitz was undermanned too but I ha
d no time anymore to do anything.They just 

run away, theWehr macht army never came to th
e camp who were fighting back. The SS run 
away and theWe hr macht didn™t come. In the 
afternoon came a high rank
ing officer, a Russian 
officer, early afternoon.  He went 
in every barrack, it was only two parts of Birkenau.  He told 
us that this is a surprise for them; that they 
can find here people who are living. They are not 
prepared for that. They can™t  give  to eat anyt hi
ng else but tea and sweet. That they br ing as 
much as we want and he will promise that in fi ve 
days we will have everything to eat. That was 
our chance.  Because these ill pe
ople who were starved, that they couldn™t eat anyt hing else but 
tea and sweet, that was the best
 solution for them. American a
nd English soldiers ma de a big 
fault when, for instance in Bergen-Belsen, the 
English people gave food, rich food for these 
people. We  know it because a cousin of his was 
there and many people died because of the rich 
food.  Here inAuschwitz everybody 
had to eat because they had not
hing.   But in two days, we 
got food already, not in five, in two days they could give us food. Then they took everybody 

fr om Birkenau to the main lager wher e the barr
acks were bleak.  It was an old soldier camp 
from the Polish army, the main ca mp  inAusc
hwitz.  Everybody was taken there from these 
wooden barracks/  Everybody was -- it was a military
 hospital for at least ill people.  Sorry to 
say, there were ma ny people who died later on becau
se they were so ill, that they coul dn™t be 
cured.  I must say that ma ybe they had not the be
st and the most up-to-dat
e me dication, but they 
were very, very careful.  I got the best treatme
nt, the best care.  I thought and I am -- and then 
afterwards I went down. You were elevated. Th
ey didn™t have to keep me  anymore and I was 
very, very ill. When I went in my -- four people 
were very Ill afterwards and I was one of them.  

I was 27 kilos that was the lowest we ight becau
se I couldn™t eat. I got mo re to eat and better 
there than anybody else. They couldn™t eat it. I 
got every day an egg and milk, it didn™t  help 
me. What was the most important, I got a weight
 gain.  Some body had to sit beside me , beside 
my bed all the night and to tell the physician if
 I don™t feel well.  Some body helped me, to call 
the physician.  One night, I was really very ill. 
 I reme mber the physician was standing beside 
me .  I don™t reme mber when I lost consciousness
 but I reme mber that the physician stood beside 

me  and was feeling,my pulse and asking me  do you f
eel better now?   I told her yes, now I feel 
better.  Because in the 
evening, I told the person who had to sit beside me , he was a ma n.That I 
feel very bad today. I had a very bad day toda
y.  I don™t know when I lost my consciousness but 
the doctor was there.  In the morning came, it was called in Russian, a Stiab.  It is a German 

name that it was a military staff and the head 
was a physician and he was a colonel and he knew 
everybody. That was in the night and at 8 o™cloc
k in the morning, he was at my bed and asked 
me  what happened to you, in the daytime you we
re not so ill.  I ha
ve seen you at noon and 
everything was okay with you and what happened to
 you in the night that you were so ill?  He 
knew everybody and he visited and from that time
, I re me mber, that several times at mi dnight, I 
awake that he is standing at my bed and fee
ling my pulse, my heart 
rate.  He knew everybody, 
he was an excellent person. 
 

Q: You didn™t have any contact with
 your father, your brother there? 
 

A: They were taken away in September, fromAusc hwitz.  I was there.  I am the only person who 
rema ined inAuschwitz. They were taken to Mierdoff.  It is in Southern Germany, Bavaria, 

Southern Bavaria.  I know because I got everyt
hing.  My father was dead in December, my 

brother survived him and my brot
her died in March, three weeks 
before they could liberate his 
camp. Actually he fell asleep during the night.  
That™s a typical test of
 the starvation. He fell 
asleep.  I know that his heart 
was very -- because of the star
vation and everything -- his heart 
was not good. 
 

Q: Your father and brother leftAuschwitz 
in September. Wa s this for labor or --? 

 

A: It was another camp. I don™t know -- don™t ask 
logic. There was no logic, one camp was like 
the other. They don™t wanted you to work; they 
wanted you to die.  In these big camps, there 
was very few work.  It was, then it was like this _____. 
 

Q: Some one fr om Budapest told you later about
 what happened to your -- some  survivors? 
 

A: Ye s. Actually, a cousin who ca me  fromTr an
sylvania and who found my 
brother dead in this 
camp by cha nce.  He was in _____ camp and he could move. That is a good feeling, he was not 

alone and this cousin could give 
some  food for him.  He wa s very 
happy, the cousin told me  that 
he is not alone and he had some body.  So this 
was not so bad. The physicians who were there, 

they have no wonder that he will di e,
 he is so ill that he will die. 
 

Q: Your father was also ill? 
 Did you know anything about  --? 
 

A: I don™t know how.  In my opinion, I told you my father was a humanist.  He died because of 
illness, that™s my theory, but because that was such a great disappointment for him in mankind, 

that such a thing could happen, th
at people can treat pe
ople like that, that this disappointment, 
because of this, he gave up. 
 

Q: You never saw your brother or your 
fa ther after you enteredAuschwitz? 
 

A: I told it at the beginning, I ha
ve seen once my father.  I told 
you that was this komma ndo, this 
garbage kommando that people, this cart was driven by people.  It was at the pl ace where they 

collected garbage.  My father was not in th
is garbage komma ndo but somehow he arranged that 
he could go out from the  lager with this garbage. 
The garbage of our lager was taken there.  He 

told this kapo who was from our lager that 
she should bring me .What ha ppened because the 
number.  If you leave, not the person was impor ta
nt, but the number. Te
n people are driving the 
cart, they can go, eleven not, but ten can go.  I wa
s told go to the garbage kommando; they will 
take you out and you can meet your father.  I me t 
my father.  Unfortunately, with the previous 
transport, my brother was there t
oo, but then I was not there.  I c
ould see my father and I hardly 
recognized my father because he looked like, be
foreAuschwitz like on this photo, he looked so 
young, not white hair or nothing. Then he was white
 and very, very old. Therefore, I tell you 
that was a disappointme nt in the whole ma nkind 
which took him away and not any of this.  I 
met him in the garbage. 
 
Q: How long did you talk to him?  

 

A: Five mi nutes. You had to br
ing the garbage and to take it. 
 

Q: You just exchanged news a
bout your mother and brother? 

 

A: Ye s, yes.  Five mi nutes. ThisAuschwitz number is 8-13160. 

 

Q: Is there anything else that you want to tell
 about your experiences 
before the liberation? 
 

A: The story with my illness.  I told you that I wa
s one of the four most ill persons. This Russian 
military hospital was dissolved in ™45, Septembe
r.  In ™45 September, I was certified (??) 
tubercul osis already and they took me  to Krakow 
because I couldn™t walk yet. They took me  to 

Krakow, the university clinic. Te n more months, I 
had to st ay there.  I was there and I returned 
to Hungary ™46, the 1
st
 ofAugust.  It was very difficult for me  to come  back, I had no 
documents, only one small paper which I got from
 the Polish Red Cross that I was this number 
and with my  name , that I was liberated inAuschwitz by the Russian army.  It was written on 

this paper that everybody is as
ked to help me  get home .   
In ™46, everybody was at home  
already, or everybody died, and I had to walk 
to Ka____ to the Red Cross and they couldn™t 
arrange me  to go home , the permission to go hom
e.  I went to the c
ouncil, to a high- ranking 
officer in Ka___ I know who he was.  I was told 
if I give him sum, I can leave the camp.  He 
will give me  document and I can go wherever I want
 but I ha ve no mone y.  He told me  if I go, 

that the paper that you have is 
nothing.  If I go to the Russian 
people, I can get the same  paper 
from the m.  It is nothing like you have.  I was ve
ry angry.  I decided that I will go to the St ate 
Departme nt in Russian.  I have to find some
body who will believe me , that I am Hungarian and 
a Jew and I have to go home .  From Ka___, the Red Cross gave me  fare, the _____, to go to 

Russia.  I we nt to the State Department and 
I went and I found some body who was responsible 
for the east European countries.  I told him th
at I am an Hungarian and he answered me 
Hungarian.  It turned out that 
during the war he was in Hungary
 and he had a Hungarian wife. 
He spoke Hungarian and then he told me  that
 he will arrange me .  
He began to call everybody 
and he told me that he will arrange for me perm
ission to leave the country.  I will get it fr om 
him but I have to come  back in ten days because
 he tried to arrange it at once but it doesn™t 
work.  He needs time  and I should return in ten 
days.  I went back to Ka____ I was living there 
at the Red Cr oss. They had such a house there.
  In ten days, I went 
again to Russia and I got 
this paper. Then I had to go to this country of
ficial again that he shou
ld give me  the stamp on 
this. Then he was very nice and he told me , 
I told you that you need a good document and that 

is a good docume nt wha t  you have now. Now you can
 leave the country.  So he was very polite 

and very nice with me .  I could come  home , not
 so easily.  It was funny because it was a group 
of Hungarian people. The most stupid story you 
have ever heard.  It was a fa mily with two 

children and I don™t know, with somebody else 
with two other people who had the same  
document what I had. A couple, it turned out th
at he was a Jew and she was a Christian and he 
was one of the me n who hadn™t got a Hungarian 
citizenship but he ha
d a Polish citizenship. 
These people from Hungary were taken away in ™
41 to some where, to Ukraine. They all were 
killed by the Germans there.  Some how, because 
the wife told that I don™t leave hi m to go alone 
and I go with him, some how, this very simple Ch
ristian woma n, she could save his life. They 
came back from Ukraine with the same paper th
at they got some how, the same  paper what I 
had.  I came home  with this group. At the frontie r, it was ™46, the Russian officer didn™t like us 
to enter the country. They say 
they will have to check who we 
are. We  had to stay at the 
border; it was joined there already, this Jewish
 organization from here, from the state. They 

gave us food, they gave us where to sleep. We
 had to wait there. That was on the Hungarian 
border.  I knew, some how, these 
are Hungarian- speaking people who 
are living in this village.  
I spoke to some body bec a use in this village used 
to live the brother-in-law of this boy with his 
sister. They used to live in 
this village. What do you know about Mr. Mueller, 
this boyfriend 
who disappeared in Russia. I asked the people, 
do you know Mr. Mueller? They told yes, he™s  
living, the wi fe is dead but he™s still living.  He 
is in the Hungarian part of the city which is 
called Est___.  I asked, how can I contact him, I 
asked this man.  He told go to the riverside, 
that is the Da nube, _____ everybody knows him in Est___, asked the smugglers. The smuggler 

will take with pleasure your letter to Mueller be
cause he is a rich man and he will gi ve them 
money.  If you write that you are here, he 
will ma nage some how that you could cross the 

border.  I did it and it happened that next day 
came  some body from the other side and looked 
for me  in the joint.  I told him that the check 
____ I™m not allowed to know that he came  to take 
me  over.  I should insist that I want to go a
nd they will allow me  without the permission but 

they will allow me  to go. They will tell that 
they don™t let me  back if I can™t cross the border 
but I should insist. The Hungarian 
said he will ma nage that I can
 enter the country.  He came , I 
don™t know.We  told the wife that he came here.  
It happened like that, that I crossed the border 
and that the Hungarian say that 
I was accepted..  He waited for me  already for me  at the border.  
That is how I came home.  In ™48 
it turned out that I have -- I ha
d relatives, and in ™48 it turned 
out --.  I alwa ys had some pain here and in ™48, 
it turned out that it 
isTB.  It was rather 
neglected as I walked with it two years long and 
I had to go to sanatorium and to lay for two 
years.  Because I had it in the backbone and th
at was the ____ treatment, now they have more 
medication. After comi ng home, I entered the 
university in ™46.  I had two years in the 
university. Then I gained a break because of this illness. That  was four years and then I 

finished, in ™55, I finished th
e university.  I got excellence. 
 

Q:ﬂ Nothing happened to your brain? 

 

A: When I was standing in the ____ valley inAusc
