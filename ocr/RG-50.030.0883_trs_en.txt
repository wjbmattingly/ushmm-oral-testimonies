was a small  congregation, of course. And the y were un Œ t he village was unable, or 
the Jews were unable t o hire a
ny
 rabbi, so the men took turns conduct ing services. 
Q: Oh, I see. And do you remember going to t he synagogue? 

A: I have a vague mem ory of it. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And apparently, there was a mi kveh, and t he cemetery right outsi de the buil ding. 
Q: About how many Jewish famil ies do you think were there, of the 500, or 600 or 

so, inhabitants? 

A: From what I have gathered from the internet, ma ybe 15 families. Ma ybe 15.

A: I been trying to find the house on the i nternet, going onto 
Google 
search. I™ve 
not been successful, but I do have a memory of it. 

Q: Please de Œ what is in your memory of the house? 

A: Well, let  me expl ain that, closer to this ti me, m y da
ughter, my eldestdaughter
, 

and her husband, who was serving in 
Germany
 Œ he was with t he n Œ 
ASA
.  
Q: The 
ASA
? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Whatis the 
ASA
? 
A: The es Œ  the Œ out of 
Fort Meade
.  

Q: Oh, so he™s with the American military? 

A: No, not the military. 

Q: Oka y, so 
A Œ 
I don™t know what 
ASA
 is.  
A: It™s a security Œ 

Q: Oka y, okay. 
A: At Œ at one point, we decided to visit them, but I was reluctant to go at first, but 

we did go. And the y took us all over, showing us places. At one point  the y asked 

whether I wanted to go back to 
Rohrba ch
, and I said no. Until j ust t he da y before 
we were to come back to the 
States
. It was too late. But, at a later time, maybe a 

year or so later, my younger daughter and her husband visited t he elder daughter

and her husband. And I described the house that we had lived in, and the y decided 
to go. 

Q: And look for it. 

A: And the y found it. 

Q: Did they? 
A: And the y told t he story of how the y walked around looking at the building from 
different angles, taki ng pictures. And a woman who Œ came out
, and wantedto 

know what  the y were doing there. And she explained that this the house their father 

and family had lived in. And she said, I often wondered what happened to those 

boys. My folks told us about it. She invited them into the house and served t
h em 

tea, coffee, refreshment s, and the y looked throughout the house. The house itself 

was very unusual, because my father had it  built. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And it was the first house in the village that had runni ng water, and a running 

toilet. 

Q: Well, you know, that™s what Œ you anti cipat ed some of the questions that I have. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Because I always ask people, what kind of modern conveniences did you have in 

your 
Œ 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
11
 
A: It was Œ  it was t he first building, or first house in 
Rohrba ch
 that had a pull chain 
for the toilet, and the villagers would come in t o experience this phenomenon. 

Q: You have a museum piece there. 

A: I been trying to find that house on the i nternet, I™ve not  been successful. But I 

understand that the synagoguehas changed handsseveral ti mes. And
 I think at one 
time it was a bakery, and a grocery. I have no idea what i t is now.  
Q: So the building remained, but i t no longer was a place of worship. 

A: No. 

Q: Oka y. What is t he address of the house that your father built? 

A: That™s what I™ve been trying to determi ne. As close as I can come to it, it™s at  the 

corner of 
Herm
(ph) 
gassen
 and 
Bunder
(ph) 
gassen
. 
Q: So 
Herm
(ph) 
gassen
 and 
Bunder
(ph) 
gassen
. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. And was it in the center of town, or was it on t he outskirts? 

A: That I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. In your mind™s e ye, can you paint a picture for me of what did 

the house l ook like? Was it two st ory, one story? 

A: I™d say, I think t hree story. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016

A: It was a very big house, on a very large l ot. There was a side yard, there was a 
backyard, which was a garden. And Œ 

Q: Was it stone? 

A: Yeah, brick buil ding, yes. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And the family had 
a farm 
Œ let™s say a garden, full of planted vegetables and 
such. 
Q: When you sa y you had running water, does that also mean you had a bathroom 

with a bathtub in it? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yes. 
Q: And did you have el ectricity? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how did you heat the home?  

A: I don™t recall. 

Q: What
 Œ do you think it might have been coal? 

A: It could have been. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
13
 
Q: Would you have coal ovens? You know there™s these very someti mes, ornate and 
glazed type of tile. Does that ring a bell in your memory? 

A: No. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: No. As I sa y, I was very young. 
Q: Oka y. And was it the nicest looking house in 
Ro hrbach
 
by 
Bietingen
?  
A: I think I™m prej udiced. I really don™t know whether the Œ probably Œ it was 
probably the most modern house, at the ti me. 

Q: Does that mean that  your father was wel l-
to
-do?  
A: I wouldn™t sa y that he was rich by any means, but the family was confortable. 

Q: Oka y. Did you have an automobile? 

A: No, no. That™s interesting. The first aut omobile that I saw, was when a cousi n, 
who had just gotten married, she and her husband drove i nto the village on their 
hone ymoon. And I remember vaguely, a ni ght trip we took to visit an au Œ an au Œ 

aunt in, oh, in bent  Œ 
Benshei m
.  
Q: 
Benshei m
, mm
-
hm.
 
A: Yes. And I don™t even know where 
Bensheim
 is in 
Germa ny
.  
Q: Al Œ it™s near 
Ro hrba ch
 
by
 Bietingen
. I don™t know either. 
A: No. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
14
 
Q: So, it was a rari ty to see an automobile Œ  
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ in the village. 

A: Very unusual. 

Q: Oka y. So what was the mode of transportat ion for most people, aside from thei r 
feet?
 
A: I™d say probably horse cart, that type. 
Q: Oka y. Was there a railwa y stati on? 

A: Not that I know of, no, but the Œ  

Q: And was the travel between towns in, let™s sa y, to 
Frankfurt
, which is a large 
city, were there buses? 

A: No. In fact, one of the things I read is t hat if youngsters wanted to go beyond an 
eighth grade, which was the only education in 
Rohrbach
, a one school Œ one room 
schoolhouse Œ but if they wanted t o go be yond eighth grade, the y had to go to 
Bietingen
, and the only wa y the y could go is to walk, bic ycle, horseback Œ 

Q: I see. 

A: Œ or a cart. 

Q: Oka y. So, it was Œ it was isolated, in some ways? 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
15
 
A: Yes. The y esti mated the Œ I say, the information I have gotten from the internet 
is that it was about  a one hour walk Œ 

Q: The eight kilometers, yeah.  

A: Œ to Œ t o 
Bietingen
.  

Q: Yeah. Was it an agri cultural community, in general? 
A: I would say yes. 
Q: Oka y. And tell me a little bit about your parents™ personalities, as you remember 

them, being a small chi ld. 

A: Well, we saw very l ittle of my father, for the most part, because he did a lot of 

traveling. His main job is to buy cattle for the butcher shop, and he would have to 

go from village to village, and to market to market to buy the cattle.  

Q: So, 
a 
horse and cart. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Oka y. You had a horse at home? 

A: I don™t recall one, no. 

Q: Oka y. Oka y, so he would Œ that Œ it wasn™t that he was standi ng in the butcher 

shop, and Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
16
 
A: That was his brother. His brother was t he butcher, and at one point  m y father 
became an apprentice butcher, which he later used once, after emigrating. 

Q: Oka y. Did the y have any other employees?  

A: Not that I know of. 

Q: So it was really a family Œ small famil
y business.
 
A: Right. 

Q: And did your mother have any help at home, or was she running t he household 

entirely? 

A: She was running the household. 

Q: And you said your father was from the vill age. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And he had one older brother. Did he have any other siblings? 
A: Yes, he did, but I don™t know where the y were. I Œ I know there was a brother by 
the name of 
Joseph 
Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ who also emi grated. 

Q: Oka y. And did you know your grandparent s? 

A: Just vaguely. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
17
 
A: I remember Œ I don™t remember my grandfather, but I have a sl Œ 
sl ight memory 
of m y grandmother, because she li ved wit h the aunt that we visited at 
Bensheim
.  
Q: I see. I see. And did your mother have relat ives that were nearby, t hat you knew? 

A: Well, it™s a strange family mixt ure. 

Q: O
k a y.
 
A: So it™s hard to sa y 
ye 
Œ for me t o sa y yes or no, because we Œ the 
Morgenstern
 
branch of the family int ermarried with the 
Stern
 
family.
 
Q: So this was not the only 
Morgenstern
-
Stern 
marriage? 
A: Oh no, no. 
Wil liam Morgenstern
, who was responsible for bringing us to 

America
, was origi nall y married to 
Elsie Stern
, who was the si ster of m y father. 
Q: So, he had a sister, too. 

A: Yeah. Now, she died at a young age, and t hen 
Bill
 
remarried. So, there™sthat one 
connection. Trying to think of the other connections, cause it gets confusing. When 
Siegfried
 married 
Bill
™
s
 sister,
 Res
he
(ph), 
Rachel
 Œ  
Q: So that™s your father. 

A: My father. 

Q: Oka y.  

A: Married the 
Morgenstern Œ Res
he
(ph)
 Morgenstern
. So that is Œ 
Q: Another connect ion. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
18
 
A: Œ another connection. We can go even furt her, the Œ there™s another inter-
marriage wit h the 
Moritz
 family. Another family that was brought over to the 

States
. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: It just goes on and on, and Œ 
Q: Are they all from about the same place, t he same area in 
Germany
? 
A: I™m 
not sure.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: But the y have t o be nearby, because travel was a bit difficult. 

Q: And, aside from 
William Morgenstern 
and 
Elsie
, where there others who had 

come to the 
United States
 before? 

A: Yes. 
Bill
 ha-had a brother, 
Saul Morgenstern
, and at one poi nt 
William Œ Bill
 
and 
Sa ul
 were prospect ing in the west. 
Q: In the 19
th
 century? 
A: Yes. Apparently they came over as young men. Don™t ask me when, but they 

were young. Eventually 
William 
moved to 
Newport News
,
 Virginia
. 
Saul
 st a yed 
out west, in 
Texas
, and he opened several busi nesses, but  he ended up in 
Borger
, 

Texas
, running a clothi ng store.  

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016

Q: Oka y. And back in 
Germany
, the 
Morgenstern 
family, was it also involved in 
businesses, as far as you know? 
A: I Œ I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: A lot of  history, unfortunately, has disappeared because our parents never tu Œ 
discussed things like that. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The y real ly didn™t tell us about the family, and what we have been able to gather 

is memories from different members of the family. And it™s all 
hearsay, actually.
 
Q: I understand. Sometimes that hearsa y is unbelievably accurate, and someti mes 

it™s not, but you need more verification to det ermine whet her it is, you know. And 

that™s someti mes not so easy to come by. 
A: Right. And that™s one reason I™ve been going on the internet, getting information. 
In fact, I utilized the local Mormon church to get on the internet. And I was able to 

retrieve the manifest of the ship that we came over on. 

Q: And what was t hat man Œ 
ma 
Œ  ship name? 
A: The 
SS Manhattan
. 

Q: Oka y. We™ll come to that part. 

A: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
20
 
Q: But, by asking you questions about your larger family, I have many purposes in 
mind. I guess the pri mary purpose is, still  through the e yes of a young child, to kind 

of get a Œ a sense and a picture of what Œ how large was your world, and how many 

people populated it, you know. 

A: Very small, but Œ 
Q: And so, you don™t have a memory of aunts and uncles coming through, and Œ 
and sort of being t here for family celebrations, or things like that? 

A: No. The only memory like that is s-sa y when a cousin, cousin 
Ruth Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ and her husband drove into town on their honeymoon. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The only other t hing is the ti me, once or twice, that we visited m y aunt in 
Bensheim
, cause I have a memory of that. We used to tease our cousin, cousin
 
Ruth
. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The y had a piano, and they had a stool, which rotated. And both 
Walter
 
and I 
used to irritate cousin 
Ruth
 by sitting on that stool, and just turning and turning. 
Q: Well, that™s fun. 

A: It was fun for us Œ 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
21
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ but not for her. That™s one memory I have. 

Q: Oka y. So cousi n
 Ruth
 sounds like she was rather comfortable, t oo. 

A: Oh yes.  

Q: If you have a piano, and you have a car Œ 
A: Oh yes.  
Q: Do you know how t hat came about? 

A: No, I don™t. 

Q: Oka y. Do 
you have any picture of 
Benshei m
 
i n your mind?
 
A: No. 

Q: Oka y. Tell me Œ you sa y your father was away a lot Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ you know, so was it that your m Œ 
your m 
Œ your mother, the person that Œ the 
adult that was the one who was t he most significant, that you would see daily Œ 
A: Oh yes.  

Q: Oka y. Tell me about her, a little bit. 

A: What can I sa y? 

Q: What ki nd of person was she? Was she shy, was she outgoing? Did she have Œ 

A: She was Œ she was rather shy. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
22
 
Q: Was she? 
A: Yes. 

Q: A quieter type of person. 

A: Very much so. In those da ys, especially in 
Germany
, women didn™t speak up 
very much.
 
Q: Oka y. Does that  mean that, even though he was absent , your father was the 
dominant i nfluence at home? 

A: Oh yes.  

Q: Oka y. Did the y get on? Did they get on? 

A: As a lot of marri ages do, yeah. The y tolerat ed each other. 

Q: Oka y. Was it an arranged marriage? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Oh, oka y. 
A: Which i s why t here was so much intermarriage in the families.  

Q: And who would have done the arranging? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: Oka y. Do you 
have any earliest memories of your ownlife?Likeglimpses, or 
episodes, or things like that, while you™re still there? 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016

A: Well, our house was on a corner lot. If you go be yond that Œ if you take a right 
turn at the corner, there was a bakery, a comm unity bake-house, where all the 

women gat hered, to bake the bread for the week. And beyond that is where 

Ludwig
, the brother, had his home. That was the family estate, where the butcher 
shop was 
[indeci pherable]
 
Q: So 
Ludwig
 was the elder brother? 

A: Yes. Now, I remember Œ one thing I do remember as a youngster. Turning ri ght

Q: Why?
 
A: And m y recollection of it was being awakened, and someone wit h face paint, as 

Halloween, gruesome paint, shone a flashlight on his face, and woke me up. 
Q: Oh m y goodness. That is terrifyi ng for a lit tle child. 
A: Yeah. That was t he idea. 

Q: Did they loot, when the y broke into the house?

Q: That™s ri ght. I understand. 
A: We just saw the beginning of it.

A: Mm-hm, right. 
Q: And one of the Œ you know, what were the first steps that were taken, that people 
experi
enced.
 
A: Yeah, well, harassing the Jews.

A: The y sai d, that™s what™s going on. And shortly thereafter, my mother decided it 
was time to leave, at the prompting of 
Bill Morgenstern
, who was aware of what 

was going on, and suggested that we all get out. 

Q: Oka y. So this must have been 1935 or 1936. 

A: Right. Well, late ™35, cause we emigrated in February of 1936. 

Q: Oka y. What about your father and your uncle™s butcher shop? Was that affected, 

at the time? 
A: I had no recollection of it, but it had t o have some effect. My father was reluctant 
to leave. 

Q: Why?
 
A: Like so many other Jews in 
Germany
, this will pass. You know, how the y 
thought.

Q:Yeah. Well,I mean I 
Œ wer Œ there 
areseveral mothers inthis room

A: Oka y. 
Q: And I can™t i magine, but Œ but I know how difficult it would be for me to hear, 

when my six year old would come home, and have somet hing to sa y like that, you 

know, and children are so vulnerable. And that ™s the Œ the first thi ng you want to do 

is Œ is safeguard them from that. 

A: Mm-hm.

Q: Do you remember your journe y out of 
Rohrbach

LaHavre
, 
France
. 
Q: Were your parent s able to take any of their assets out of 
Germany
? 
A: Nothing to speak of. 
Q: Oka y. Some people reported that they were able to send their furni ture abroad,

Œ they bought jewelry, and the y took the jewelry with them. 
A: I know nothing like that.

on the boat?  

A: Not that I know of. 
Q: Oka y. Did any of the other passengers make an impression on you? 
A: No. 

Q: When you were t old to leave school, by that German teacher, how did that affect 

you?
 
A: I was just bewildered. I didn™t know what t o think, or what to do. This was an 

auth Œ authority figure, sa ys go, don™t come back. What does a six and a half year 

old boy do to that? 
Q: Yeah. So, i Œ you™re more Œ you™re, you know, sort of like you lost your 
moorings. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your brother and

Q: Vaguely, okay. And do you remember meeting hi m? 

A: Oh, I remember t hat , yes. 

Q: Can you describe that for me?

j Œ walking down the gangplank, and meeting him there.  

Q: What di d he look li ke? 

A: 
Bill Morgenstern

Somebody had to take care of it, so I guess 
Roselyn

Q: Oka y. And remi nd me again, he had come over with his brother? 

A: Not wit h his brother, but they had come over as young pe Œ young men.

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: When di d you stop speaking German? 

A: Almost  i mmediately. That was one rule that

A: Somewhat, yes. 

Q: He™s a relative, after all. 

A: Oh yes, a very important relative that Œ and he had a nice house, small house, 

that we lived in for a while. One bedroom, one bathroom Œ not one bedroom, a one 

bathroom house, that took care of his family, and ours, and Œ and others as well, 

eventually. 
Q: Well then, tell us about what that Œ as I asked you to paint a pi cture of your 
house in 
[indecipherable]
 can you paint one for me, in words, of thi s house? 

A: All right, that I ma y be able to do. I know t he house was on 
61st Street
, near 

Virginia
 Œ  just off 
Virginia Avenue
, the second house off 
Virginia Avenue
. And 

across the highway was a big structure, which was a water tower for the area. The 

house itself was wood. It was the Œ coal heated. And I remember many times 
Bill

would go down in the basement and stroked t he furnace. And the coal truck would 
empty the coal down the chute, to t he basement. 

Q: Two story house, three story? 

A: Two story. 

Q:Oka y. Abouthow many bedrooms?
 
A: Either two or three, I don™t recall  exactly. 

Q: And so you say Œ so, it was modest house. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And his own family, you sa y it was 
Rosalie

children?  

A: 
Rosely n

Roselyn

Q: And what kind of impression did they make on you, when you first arrived? You 
were European kids, and the y™re American. Was there Œ di d you sense any 

difference? 

A: No, no
. Wegot along.
 

Q: So didn™t Œ that Œ that was seamless?  
A: Right. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: I guess youngsters find it much easier t o integrate. 

Q: Youngsters can pla y when the y don™t speak each other™s languages. 

A: Right. 

Q: It™s amazing. How l ong did you sta y with him in the Œ in this wa y? 

A: Less than six months. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: I remember we moved into the shipyard apart ments, which as I recall, were three 

separate buil dings, large buildings. Rothe Œ roas Œ roach i nfested buil dings. I mean, 

big. 

Q: The southern ki nd.

A: I remember that. And before long, we moved to a house on 
26
th
 
Street
, just off 
Huntingto
n Avenue
. 
Q: Did you Œ did any Œ did your family get any help from any agenc y? 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: Oka y. So this sounds like entirely a private enterprise. Nothing that would have 
involved a community agency, a Jewish agency, a government agency.  
A: Not that I know of. Remember, in order to bring i mmigrants into the country, the 

sponsor had to sign a paper, the y would be responsible. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The government  didn™t want Œ couldn™t  do anything, th Œ the government at the 

time, was handicapped. We were in a depression. 

Q: That™s true. 
A: And in addition to t hat, you had the Ameri can firsters Œ isolationi sts. They didn™t 
want to get involved wi th other people. And of course Œ and before Father 

Coughli n
, and so on, t hey were quite influent ial, at the time. 
So ,
 what could the 
government  do? The politicians were scared, they wanted to sta y in power. As we 

have right now. 

Q: Politicians have always wanted to stay in power. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
39
 
A: Right. So it was up t o individuals, and 
Bill
 and 
Roselyn
(ph) were granted 
permission to support 125 people.  
Q: That™s amazing. 

A: And when the y filled that quot a, they persuaded other people to sponsor 

immigrant s. 
Q: Well, this i Œ this is not inconsequential , you know. Can you t ell me a little bit 
about your memori es of who Œ what the y were like, what were thei r personalities? 

Like I asked about your father and your mother, what can you tell me about them? 

A: Well,
 Roselyn
(ph) was a beautiful lady. She was out going, and j ust friendl y with 

everybody. 
Bill 
was a doer. He served many terms as president of the congregation, 
Rodef Sholom
. As a businessman, he was friendly to everybody.  
Q: Washe particularly well
-off? 
A: No, far from it. In fact, 
Ernie Œ
 
Ernestine
, his daughter, tells the story of 
coming downstairs one morning, and found her father with his head i n his hands, on 
the table, worried that he didn™t have money t o buy food that da y. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: We were coming out of the depression at the time. How many pieces of china 

and gifts were Œ were being bought at the t ime? 

Q: Not many, cause that™s not a necessity. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
40
 
A: That™s ri ght. So, he was struggling. 
Q: But that just underscores the unusual part of the story. 

A: Right. 

Q: That despite that Œ did he talk about his own family in 
Germany
, did he talk 
about 
Germany
, did he talk about getting people out, di d he Œ 
A: No, not Œ not to me, no, not that I™m aware of. 

Q: Oka y. Were you the first ones that came over? 

A: We were the first that the y brought over.  

Q: Oka y. And so, how did your father get on his feet financiall y, and your mother?  

A: My father took a job, the only job he could get, I assume, in a warehouse, at five 

dollars a week. My mother would bake cakes, that she would sell  on order, from 

people in the communi ty. In addit ion to that, she became the janitor of 
Rodef 
Sho lom
 
temple. And many is
 the ti me, after a rain, she had to go down to the 
temple and bail water out of the basement.  
Q: That™s not easy. 

A: No. 

Q: Did they find it  hard to adjust here? 

A: My father did, yeah. My mother, not too much. But eventually Œ  

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
41
 
Q: What was Œ excuse me for interrupting, but what was hard for him, in the 
adjust ment? 

A: He was used to the German way, what he had been doing. He was his own boss 

all those years, and suddenly he was worki ng for someone in a warehouse in a Œ 
a 
business he knew nothi ng about. 
Q: Had the y Œ had he had higher education, your father? 
A: I don™t think so. 

Q: And your mother? 

A: I doubt it. I don™t think women at the ti me, or girls at ti me Œ 

Q: It was unusual. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: It was unusual. 
A: But I would sa y within a year or so, he opened up a grocery, again on 
26
th
 
Street
, just a half a block up from where we were living. And if I remember 
correctly, the store was opened after sundown on s Œ on Saturda y, first da y. And 

Bill Morgenstern
 came to the house afterwards, and sai d, how did Œ asked how he 

did, and the answer was, we took in eight  dollars. And 
Bill
 said, that™s great. I 

remember that much, because we were comi ng out of a rep Œ depression. Eight 

dollars was a lot of money then. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
42
 
Q: Yeah, particularly if it was five dollars a week that he was earni ng Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ you know, in the warehouse. 
A: Right. 

Q: And did Œ did that become a family affair? 
A: Yes. When lud Œ
 Ludwig
 and his fami ly were brought over, he entered the 
business. He wa Œ he was the butcher in the family anywa y. 

Q: Ok
a y.
 
A: Again, m y father di d more of the physical work of going to the sl aughterhouse, 

and bringing sides of beef into the business, and so on. 

Q: Oka y, so he went back to what he knew. 

A: Yes. 
Q: But now, instead of just a butcher shop, it was a grocery store. 
A: Right, small grocery, neighborhood. 

Q: Did you help out in it? 

A: When the y bought a vehicle, which was a quarter ton panel truck Œ they don™t 

make them anymore Œ I became the driver. And I had to drive my fat her to the 

slaughterhouse and back, and so on. 

Q: So this would have been in the 40s, already.

43
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Oka y. And how many years was your mot her the janitor at the temple? 

A: I™d say a couple of years. 

Q: Oka y. Did this have strains at home, this adjust ment? You know, the crossing 

over from Œ from 
E urope
, you know, gett ing on your feet here, and so on? 
A: Well, a certain amount of strains adjusting, and of course, earni ng a living, so 

yes.Butwe managed. The y managed. 
Walter
 and I, besides selli ng newspapers Œ 
delivering newspapers, when, while were still in the shipyard apart ments Œ 
Q: With the roaches. 

A: Hm?  

Q: With the roaches. 

A: Yes. Farmers would bring their trucks by with their produce. He and I would 
take stuff, and run up and down the stairs, hawking 
[indecipherable]
 a penny. And 
we used to sell extras, t hose da ys t here were a lot of extras. Saturda y nights, after 

football games, the papers would put out an extra with the scores. And somehow 

m y brotherfound what wascalled,

school. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Which was just a stone™s throw from t he high school. We ki Œ finished 
elementary school, whi ch was through the seventh grade, and then we entered high 
school. We didn™t have a middle school or junior high in those days, we only went 

11 years, and not 12. 

Q: Oh really?

Walter 
became edi tor of the school paper. 
He won a prize, I forget whether it was the American Legion, or the 
VFW
, city-
wide contest, essay contest. And he graduated with honors from high school. I took 

a different tack in high school. I joined too many organizat ions. Now, I can realize 

that. Glee club, chorus, newspaper, athletics, t hose things. I graduated with honors. 
Q: Also with honors. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So why would that be somethi ng where you™d sa y it was too much? 

A: I joined too many organizations, I spread myself out too thin. Couldn™t 

concentrate on anything. 

Q: But nevertheless, you graduated with honors. 

A: Yeah, oh yeah. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: So, school went wel l. He Œ

A: The y were concerned, especially about t he family. 

Q: Well, that was a question: who was left behind? 

A: Excuse me. 
Q: Sure, no problem. 
A: I have what I call a running nose, an Olym pic nose. 

Q: Me too.  

A: The only one that was left in 
Germany
 was Mother™s sister, 
Rosa
, and her 
husband, and their mother. 

Q: So, your grandmother. 

A: Yes. The y had a chance to leave 
Germany
, but they refused, be cause the 
grandmother had diabetes, and she could not enter the 
United States
. So the y 

stayed, to take care of her. 

Q: Would t he 
Morgensterns
 have brought them over? 

A: Yes.

also brought over, 
Max
,
 Max Loeb
(ph), or 
Li eb
(ph), served in the army, and he 
was in intelligence. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And when the war ended, he sta yed over, and he looked for his fa Œ parents. 
Couldn™t find them. 
Q: Oh dear. So the y just vanished? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Vanished from t he horizon. Tell me a lit tle bit more about the other people that  

were brought over. 

A: Well,I™ve mentioned 
Ludwig
,
 Emma
, and 
Ruth
, cousins. 
Q: All by 
Morgenstern
. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And there was 
Ruth

A: Well, they started Œ 
Q: That™s where the y started.  

A: There was 
Paul Morge

,
 Bill

s 
brother, and he set them up i n a similar 
business, i n neighboring 
Hilton Village
. 

Q: Si milar to his own? 
A: Yes. Just three, four mi les from 
Newport News
, down the road, on route 60. He 
didn™t like it, so he and his wife and daughter 
Edith
, they moved to Œ I think it was 
Brooklyn
. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And he got a job in a silversmi th company, I can™t think, it was 
Gorham
(ph), or 
somebody up here. And he became quite well-to-do. There was a 
Max Loeb
(ph), as 
I mentioned. There was 
Ludwig Moritz
(ph), who had married a 
Stern 
sister, and 
their daught ers, 
Margo
(ph) and 
Beatrice

Joseph

and his wife 
Tilly
(ph), and 
Joe Œ Joseph
, who I remember, whenever you met hi m, 
as a kid, he alwa ys reached in his pocket and brought out a piece of candy he 

offered you. He opened up a small hardware business in 
Newport News
. 
Q: And thi s sounds phenom Œ for somebody who is not well-to-do, who himself had 

the worry of how do I put food on the table, t he more you menti on names, the more 

I think, what an amazing person he must have been.

A: Right. 

Q: Was 
Œ did he ever have any help from anybody? Did t he congregat ion help? 
A: Not that I know of as, you know, handing him money, no. Not that I™m Œ 

Q: Or taking peopl e in, let™s sa y, letting them Œ letting them Œ 

A: I™m sure Œ I™m sure there were people that did, not that I can tell you who the y 
were, or anything like t hat. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: I mean, he was quit e influential in the congregation. 

Q: Was there a large Jewish community in 
Newport News
? 

A: A decent size community. At that ti me, the shipbuilding industry, t h Œ 
because of 

the war, brought in a lot of people. And, of course, the arm y and t he air f Œ corps Œ 

we™re near

just since we moved here, I met a family, and they were stationed in t he area, and he 
worked at 
Fort Eustis
, and when I said 
Fort Useless
, he laughed. 

Q: He knew what you were talking about. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. Was it all extended family members? Were there others? 
A: Probably others as well, because while I™m familiar with the family members 
that were brought over, he had gott en other people to sponsor ot her i mmigrants, and 

I™m not familiar who they would have been. Either the sponsors, or the i mmigrants. 

Q: Did Œ did you maint ain sort of like, social relations wi th hi m? Did you visit hi m 

at his home often, or when s Œ once your famil y left, was it a rare t hing that you saw 

them? 

A: The Œ we mixed qui te a bit. And there was another family, anot her member of 
the 
Stern
 family lived in 
Newport News
. She had married 
Ike Spiegel

A: Yes. And after Œ right after that, and when I graduated, I was inducted into the 

arm y 
Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And when I was discharged from the army, I went to 
Fairmont
,
 West Virginia

Q: Got it. 

A: So, at t hat point, my associations in 
Newport News
 were extremel y li mited.

Q: When di d you learn of what had really happened to the Jews of 
Germany
, and 
the Jews of 
Europe
?  
A: Well,as we 
Œ we followed the war, you couldn™t help but be aware of what was 
goingon. My mo
ther constantly talked about it. In fact, at one poi nt,
 William
 
cautioned her not to be so public Œ public about it. 
Q: Why?
 
A: Because the influences of 
Henry Ford
, Father
 Coughlin
, and so on, were also 
felt in 
Newport News
, and didn™t want to bring anything to bear on the Jewish fa Œ 
congregation. 

Q: Let™s tal k about this a little bit. Did you have a social l ife outside of a Jewish 

community? 

A: Not really. 
Q:Oka y. Anddid you experienceany kind of 
Œ I mean, the common word woul d be 
anti-Semiti sm, but Œ 
A: Oh, yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: Oh yes.  

Q: How did it express i tself? 

A: Well, when you™re called a kike, Christ kill er, you know what™s going on.

Q: Was thi s at school, or is this i n the streets? 
A: Yeah, it was in school. 

Q: It was i n school. 

A: I™ll mention a coupl e of things. I pla yed football. At one assembly in high 

school, the coach was passing out the lett ers and so on, and I remember hi m sa yi ng, 
I knew we would have a winning season, because I have a Jew on the team. 
Q: And how™d you take that comment? 

A: Pass it over. 

Q: So this is the second time someone Œ it™s not a kid, it™s someone in authority. 

A: Mm-hm. And yet, probably at the ti me, the most successful basket ball coach in 

Virginia
 was 
Jul ie Kahn
(ph). As we call ed him, Madman 
Julie
. During games he 
would get so worked up, he woul d actually froth at the mouth. But he was athleti c 
director, as Œ was basketball and track coach. 
Q: Did your father experience this in his business, as far as you know? 

A: He never mentioned it. 

Q: Oka y. But 
William Morge
nstern
 tells your mother, don™t talk so much?  
A: Right. It™s not unusual. We have Œ I™ve experienced a few incidents. For 

instance, when we first  moved int o 
Vantage House
 Œ 

Q: Here, where you™re living now. 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
55
 
A: Yeah. I was asked whether I would conduct some services, and I started. And at 
one point one of the residents, a Jewish, said we don™t want so many services. We 

don™t want to call at tention to ourselves. 

Q: Still. 

A: I can recal l back i n 
Fairmont
, I was conducting a campaign Œ I think it was for 
Israel 
bonds. It was either 
Israel 
bonds, or 
JNF
. I forget which, cause I did both. 

But the person that  had been runni ng the campaign, was approached by the fellow 

that came from 
Pittsburgh
 to oversee the campaign, to have a public event. He said 

no, I won™t  do it. Well, I was presi dent of 
B™nai Brith
 at the ti me, and he asked me 
to do it. So I said, okay. And we set up a dinner meeting i n a hotel. 

Q: This is 
West Virginia
, mm
-hm. 
A: And, in addition to t he Jewish people, I invited the presidents of the local banks, 
cause we were trying to sell Œ it was bonds, now that I remember put ting it together, 
we were approaching t he banks to buy bonds. And we had a young man pla ying the 

guitar and singing, as entertainment. So he did his shtick, and he start ed to talk, and 

the most i nfluential Œ one of the most influential people in the community, a Jewi sh 

doctor, got up and came to table; I was sitt ing with a friend. And he said, stop hi m. 

And m y friend got up, and went up to the entertainment, said, no pitch. And the 

reason was, he didn™t want to make a big deal of Jews. And after that, when I met 

 
Interview with Henry Stern  
 
June 8, 2016 
 
 
 
56
 
with the Œ the represent ative of the campaign, I said, this will never happen again. 
And we had open campaigns throughout, afterwards. Not only for 
JNF
, but also for 

Israel
 bonds. And we invited Œ members of the family brought members of the 

family to all the events. 

Q: These last two incidences that you ment ion to me, sound like internalized 
responses, rather than an external Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ manifestation. 

A: Haven™t you her Œ haven™t you heard of the camp Œ in the current campaign, we 

don™t want 
Sa nders
 as president, because he™ll  think that anything goes wrong, i t™ll 
fall back, they™ll accuse the Jews? I™ve heard it many ti mes. There is a certain 

insecurity that manifests itself at times. 
Q: How do you react to that? 
A: I said forget it. Let™s go on. We have services twice a month here now, and it ™s 

publicized, well publici zed. Every ti me we have a service, it ™s in the newsletter. It™s 

in a sign in the elevators, when we have services. We have the afternoon group of 

the 
NCJW
 meeting here. 
Q: Going back to your younger years in 
Newport News
, many people from 

Euro pe
, refugees, would say that when they came over, before the war, and the y

ended up in the south, t hey were taken aback 
by whatthey sawas racial 
discrimination, when t hey would arrive and see that there are different facilities for 
white Americans and African Americans. Di d things li ke that exist i n 
Newport 

News
 that collided, let™s sa y, with your life, with your world down there? 

A: There was definitel y segregation, there was discri mination, and it got to the 
point, especially the further south Œ 
well, we 
Œ there were reports, when th-the civil 
rights movement was going on, that Jews didn™t want the 
young people 
Œ Jewish  
young people coming down. We have to li ve here, the y would sa y. I™m sure you™re 
aware of that. 

Q: The community that  you lived in, the na Œ 
t he com 
Œ the neighborhood or so, 

was it a homogenous neighborhood, or was it gentile as well as Jewish? 

A: Mostly gentile.  
Q: Mostly gentile. And mostly white? 
A: Yes, all white. 

Q: All whi te. 

A: We were in the south. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: For instance, I mentioned that t he Œ the grammar school was ri ght down from the 

high school. There were separate high schools. There was 
New port News
 high

school, and I forget what they call i t, but t he blacks had their own. And the days 
were separate but equal Œ so called. 

Q: Did you e Œ did you ever go back to your Œ you mentioned earlier, a trip that 

sounds more recent, but before then, did you ever go back to 
Euro pe
, after having 
moved here to the 
States
? 
A: Well, we went t o 
Paris
 once, and 
London
.  
Q: Oka y. But not 
Germany
? 
A: No. 

Q: And the first time you set foot in 
Germany
 again, was in what year? 
A: Actual year, I don™t recall the actual year, but it had to be in the 70s, 80s. 

Q: Oh, I see, so that far back?  

A: Yes. 
Q: So Œ but is that when you Œ you went with your daughter, or is that more recent? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh, you went with your daughter in t he 70s or 80s? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. And Œ and then later, she went back, or another child went back Œ

there?  

A: Not that I know of. 

Q:Oka y. Did you af 
Œ did you see the pict ures of the house? 
A: I have seen pictures of the house, yes. 

Q: Oka y. But you yourself, after the 70s or 80s, never went back? 

A: No. I had decided I was going back, very recently. 
Rita
 and I had planned a ri ver 

cruise from 
Fra nkfurt 
to 
Amsterdam
. We had our tickets, everyt hing was planned. 
And I had contacted a person from the tourist bureau in 
Frankfurt
. And I™m Œ told 

what I was thinking about, and I would li ke to go back to see 
Rohrbach
. And asked 
hi m whether there was transportati on available, of any kind. Repl ied that he woul d 
meet me, and he would drive me. He was very friendly, very solicitous. But 
unfortunately, somethi ng happened, and I had to cancel the trip. 

Q: Oh. 

A: So that™s gone.  

Q: When you 
Œ so you™ve been back one ti me to

A: Well,
 I t hink, about a week. 
Q: Oka y. Did you feel Œ did you feel comfortable, or uncomfortable? Not in your 

environment? I want to get a sense of what was it like for you when you did go 

back. 

A: It was all right unt Œ except for one incident . We had put up one ni ght, I forget 
where, in a Œ I guess you would call it, al most  a bed and breakfast type of affair, an 
apartment building. And I had con Œ talked to the man about paying t he next da y 

with my credit card, and he said, fine. So the next morning, when I went to pay pare 

Œ and I talked to hi s wife to take my credit card, he said oh, no, no, no, we can™t 

take it, you ha Œ you have to do that in advance. And so quickly I sprouted some 

German
. Where it came from, I don™t know. She said oka y, oka y. She took it. 
Q: So you re Œ you still  could recall it? 
A: Yes. 
Q: You sti ll could recall German. 

A: Some, I Œ I can recall words at times. 

Q: Oka y. Is there anyt hing else that you could tell me about Mr.

A: Directly across the street from our house in 
Rohrbach
, was t he synagogue. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: From t he information I™ve gotten on the internet, there were three tourists, the y 

disappeared. The building was sol d at auction for around 500 marks Œ 560 marks, I 
think it said. 
Q: When?
 
A: It was a forced sale, and there are no records of that mone y ever having been 

paid. I thought that  was interesting. 

Q: It is int eresting.  It is interesting. So thi s was clearly in the 1930s.

any that ma y haveemi grated.
 
Q: Who would be the rightful owner? Which legal body would be the rightful 
owner of that synagogue? 

A: Well, depending on Œ I see there you™re get ting to a legal matter Œ 
depending on 
the validity of the auction sale, who Œ who bought it Œ t here™s no record of who the 

buyer was. As far as any Jews Œ well, the Jewi sh congregation Œ 

Q: Yeah, that™s what I mean Œ 
I meant.

63
 
A: Well, the people in 
Rohrbach
 now, have no recollection of this. 
They re 
Œ they 
weren™t born then. But the y have Œ the community has a history, their parents or 
grandparent s, the y share in a responsibility for what happened. The y can say if they 

want to, that they didn™t know, but God, who do the y think they™re ki dding? The y 

had to know. Just as the Poles sa y they di dn™t know that we had concentration 
camps around the corner. The y had to know. 
Q: Well, they were i n them, too. There were mil lions of Poles in those 

concentration camps as well. 

A: Yes. 

Q: How did Mr.

st
 
Street
 house, the y bought another house, 
overlooking the 
James 
river, which was just a mi le or so awa y. Was a nice, smal l 
house, well  taken care of. And he used to sit out on his back lawn, looking at the 

sunset, as it disappeared Œ the sun disappeared over the 
James
 river bridge, and so 

on. He died, I think, in ™56, or ™57. He had retired. His son 
Jules
 had taken over the 
business. 

Q: Did the kids know of all of his activities, and what he had done?
