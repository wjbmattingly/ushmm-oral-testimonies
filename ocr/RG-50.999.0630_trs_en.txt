sold in the store.
 
 
In 1940, the Soviet Arm y m arched into Vascauti anddraf ted youngm en, including 
Rita's father, into the Arm y.W hen axis troopsinvaded the Soviet Union the next year,

Rom anian soldiers entered Vascauti and toldall the Jews to prepare to leave within 24 hours. 
 
 
Rita's fam ily was able to bribe Romanian soldiers who took thefam ily to a ghetto in 
T ransnistria.T he area known asT ransnistria is show

took Rita'sfam ily in. Rita was abletoattenda sm all classbut duringthe three years thefam ily

Af t e r  t

Person
 
today but to be our closing 
F
i rs t  
P
erson as we end our 2017 year.
 
W e're going to start 
right awa y because we have a short periodand you have a great deal to share with us. So 
we ' ll ge t  righ t  in t o  it .  
 
 
Although W orld W ar II began with Ger
many and the Soviet Union invading Poland in 
September
 
1939, war didn't come directly toyour com munity in Rom ania until 1940. Before we 
turn to your life during the war andduring theHolocaust, tell us a little bitabout yourf am ily and 

your ver y earl y lif e before the war began.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Of course, I have to go back 76 ye
a r s . Tha t ' s  a 
lot of years.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you were ver y young.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. I have f ragm ented pieces of mem ory. But them em ories that I have 
were good, in the
 
beginning very good. 
 
 
I camef rom a loving f am ily. M y m other was the eldest.T wo of her siblings died at an 
early age so she was one of six. She was theeldest in thefam ily, the f irstto getm arried
. A nd , 
of  course, I was the 
f irst grandchild. And you k
now what that's like.
 
My grandparents lived in a 
sm all village nearby. We would go to visit ve ry of ten. And in thosedays my grandm otherdid 

ever ything herself . I rem ember her churningbutter.T hey had an orchard. W e would visit quite 

of ten. She would s
ew
 
dressesfor me. It was wonderful. Andm y parents lived in a two
-
f a m il y  
home, which was shared with m y father's sister and hertwo children as well as her 

m other
-
in
-
law. Andm y grandmother lived with us. 
 
 
And thanks to m y grandm other, m yf irst language or mother tonguewas Yiddish 
becausem any of them iddle class Jews in that area spoke Germanto their childrenand she 

said, no, I want m y granddaughter to learn
 
Yiddish.And that was thefirst languagethat I 
spoke. 
 
 
Of course, Inever went to school in Rom aniabecause of the war.
 
I had toys, f riends, 
doll carriage. My f ather used totake me to services at a young age. I do remem ber that.W e 

celebrated in thef all. He had a lovef or it. I think asa result, I love attending services. He used 

to read services
 
and had a beautiful voice.
 
Unf ortunately I didn't get to know him  very well 
because
 
--
 
I ' ll t e llm y t a le .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
He was a respectedm em ber of the comm unity.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Very m uch respected. My firsttrip toIsrael I metsom e of hisf riend
s  and  
fam ily m em bers and they told me what a charitableperson he was. He was loved by ever yone, 

a dapper dresser.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W esaw him  in his bow tie earlier.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes, that's right. He had lots off riends, played chess. He was a good
 
businessm an.W e lived in a house where we had electricity, m odern bathroom .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You had indoor plum bing. Right? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
W e had a well, actually.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But you had a modern home for the times.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Righ t .  W
edidnot have washing machines or dryers but we did have a 
radio.T he year I was born in they had already heard Hitler's speeches. That'sthe reason I'm  

an only child. They didnothave anym ore. I was 4
 
1/2. Don'tthinkayounger child would have 
s u r vi ve d
 
that period of  tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How large was your extended fam ily? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
You mean anum ber?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yeah.Lotsof  aunts and uncles?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Aunts and uncles.
 

 
4
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Cousins? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
I'd say at
 
least30. It waswonderful. As youm entioned before, m yf ather 
wa s
 
--
 
they had a textil e
 
business
.They would weave native costumesf or the Ukrainians. 
T
hey hada dry goodsstore in f rontof  thehouse. Our porch was not evenf inished. Therewas 
a  lit t le  b
alcony which was not enclosed yet. I rem ember happy timesthere
, p
la yin g wit h  m y 
cousins.Butthat unf ortunately was ver y short.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And wi th Germ any and the Soviet Union attacking Poland in September
 
193 9 ,  
beginningW orldW arII, it was som e months af ter that,however, bef ore the war actually 
directly affected you and yourf am ily when the Soviets occupied your hometown of  Vascauti. 

And that was in 1940.
 
Although you were notyet 4 years old at the tim e, tell us what you can 
about the circum stances and what yourf am ily's lif e was like under that time of  theSoviet 

occupation.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
W ell, it was hard.They sent the wealthy Jews to sigh
 
Siberia. They started 
conscripting
 
the young m en to the Arm y. T hey conscriptedm y father. So at that tim e when 
they did, they were therefor aperiod of tim e,about a half a year. I was 4
 
1/2.W hen we said 
goodbye tohim , little did I know that that was the last time I would see him. T hat's why I don't 

have vi vid m emories of him . 
 
 
But his sisters, who em igrated to the UnitedStates, whenm y grandm other becam e 
a widow inW orldW ar I, they were in the United Statesand they toldus wonderf ul stories. He 

was an only son. He had three sisters.T heycam e toAmerica when they were only 16 and 18 

tom ake it easy on m ygrandm other who was a widow. T hey went tothe golden land,a land of  

opportunity, where they said there was gold in the streets but they worked ver y hard in 

sweatshops as that'swhat this country is known f or, imm igration, and our doors opento 

ever ybody. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W henyour f ather was draf ted and taken into theSoviet Arm y, at the time did 
your m other or anybody know where he hadgone? Did they know anything?
 

>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
No.W ehad no idea.But m y uncle,for som e reason, they didno
t ta ke h im . 
Andone very f rightening incident
 
was when they 
had a m arch, and they m arched past
 
the 
Russians, pasttheir house. My cousin who was seven years older thanI, he climbed up to the 

attic and looked out and all of a sudden we heard banging onthe
 
doors, open up. And there 
wa s
 
--
 
" T here isa spyhere."  He was a 10
-
year
-
old spy?W e were so f rightened.W e hid under 
the bed. T hey cam e up to m y parents' bedroom  and m y m other begged them . She said, 
ﬁN
o , 
there isno spy here. My husband is serving in you
r A rm y.
ﬂ 
T hey went throughall the things. 
But thank God they we re satisf ied.T hey saw m y little cousin. And they lef t us alone.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
For little kids thatm ust have been terrif ying.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. It was atraumatic experience.T hat was
 
m y f irsttaste of what was to 
c o m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ith yourf ather gone, who was lef t in your household with you at that time?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
W ell, m y uncle, m yf ather's sister, of  course,and herfam ily, andm y 
grandm other
a
nd m y m other.
 
>> B ill B
enson:
 
And your aunt is your Aunt Bella.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Oh, yeah.T hat was her lucky
 
--
 
thank you ver y m uch.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usabout her.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
She worked in atax off ice for the Russians at the time. She was with us. 
W hen s he  wa n t
ed to go hom e tom y grandparents', the trains were no longer going and that 
was her lucky break. Because they m et with horrible death, which I'llgo into later.
 

 
5
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That circum stancem eant she had to stay.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. She had to stay. She cam e to be with us because there were more 
job opportunities. She was seven years younger thanm y m other.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
During the tim eof  the Soviets, do you know what happened to your parents' 
business and their ability to continueto support y
ou? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
T hey had to close the business. Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know if  that's
 
--
 
because of that, econom icswere obviously m ore 
diff icult,feeding thefam ily, do you know anything about thattime?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Som ehow we m anaged. I don't really rem em ber exactly. I couldn't say. But 
it was better than when the Rom anians came back.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And let's turn to that. June
 
22, 1941, Germany and its allies turnedon the 
Soviet Unionand Romanian troops, who were allies of the Nazis, occupied your town of  
Vascauti. T he threats on you and your fam ily were im m ediate. T ell us what that m eant for you 

and your fam ily.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
W ell, the Romanians c
am e m arching into the streets. The f
irst th in g the y 
did was they took20 Jews at random and shot them. One of them em bers who were shotwas 

som ebody who worked in the sam eoff ice, anengineer,as m y aunt.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So just 20at random  just to terrori ze.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
T his is what it is. And September or October of 1941,
 
an announcem ent 
was m adetoall Jews, you're going to have to leave your home;be ready to leave in 24 hours. 

Can you imagine?W hat can you take with you? 24 hours
,  
whatprecious things do we take? 
 
 
My m other dressedm e in layers of  clothing. Ihada backpack. I guess sheput 
clothing in there.They tookpillows. T hey hadsuitcases. My m other tookm y f ather'sprayer 

shawl 
and about seven of  his suits thinking that he would return. And we had tobe ready to 
leave everything behind.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
S o  a ll c
arried by hand.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. And m y grandm other, m ay she rest inpeace, she tookm oney and 
had it sewn in herundergarments. And I said, "W hyare you doing this, Grandma?"
 
And she 
said, "W e'llnever know. T his m ight save our lives."  And shehad
 
goodforesight because that, 
indeed, helped us.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf am ily also, I believe, hid some things in the house.T ellus about it. 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. My m other went into theattic.She hadm oney andphotos.Because 
m any of  m y f riends who 
are survi vors, they are soenvious that I still have some photographs.
 
First of all, we didhave fam ily and we usedtosendphotographs tothem , in the United States. 

My husband,f or example, he didn'thave one single photo andhe was told he was just a 

be
autif ul baby and the wom en used to throw flowers in his carriage
 
because he had curly hair 
and h
azel eyes but henever saw one picture. So he said
,  ﬁY
ou're so lucky you have pictures of  
yourself  as ababy.
ﬂ 
So m y m other hadforesight, too.She hidheralbu
m  of  pictures. That's 
how I came to have those.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In your attic.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Very precious. Yes. Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sonow you're told you have 24 hours. You've packed everything.W hat 
happened to you then? 
 

>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ok. 
W e were all gathered
,  
f rom what I recall, 
in  
a very bi g hall. 
[Indiscernible] it was noisy. It was terrible.W e were supposed tobe senttoa death cam p.W e 

hadbeen on the trains.
 

 
6
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They put you on the trains?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Oh, ye a h . M
y unclefound out, you know, speaking to other people,other 
im m igra n t s
 
--
 
well, others who hadto leave their hom es, andfoundout that som e soldiers 
couldbe bribedand they would take usover across the river to theUkraine, a ghetto which 
was a concentration of Jews in oneplace.W e were only allowed tobe inone area.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That was Ukraine,onthe other side of the river.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. There was also a labor cam pnearby. So,of  course, we took a 
chance. And when he heard that, at 
night wesnuck away. And that's where m y grandm other's 
m oney cam e in handy.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To pay thebribe to these soldiers.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Correct. So we went on barges. As we were onbarges, we were escorted 
by the Rom anian soldiers. And a Romanian soldier held m y hand. I guess hem ust have 

looked intom y m other's faceand she had ananguished look, was scared to death. Because 

m any children were thrown into the river and they drowned.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothesoldiers deliberately threw them .
 
>> R i
ta Rubinstein:
 
Oh, yeah.T hey took the money but they threw the children in. And when 
he saw m y m other'sface, he said, " Don't worry. I have a little girl."  At the time I was 1. He said, 

" I have a little girl the same age. I will not harm  your daughter." So that was thef irst tim e that I 

was saved.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sof rom  therenow you're goi ng into the ghetto.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
W hich was a very, ver y prim itive village. Here we cam ef rom am odern 
town. But we were ver y fortunate. A Jewish fam ily was f orcedtotake us in. Many peopledidn't 

have a roof over their heads, where to go.T hey were af am ily off our. T he thing that heat
ed  
their 
house was apotbelly stove. T here were no bathroomf acilities.T here was a pail. It was 
alwa ys cold. But they were very kind to let nine of us
 
--
 
there were nine of  us.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To go in with theirf our.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
T his was a one bedroom  andone huge room  which was
 
--
 
which serve d as 
a  kit ch en
,  
dining room , whatever. So there were 13people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 I
n that little house.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Little house.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And I think you told me
 
--
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Not h in g lik e  a  Mc
M
ansion today.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I thinkyou toldm e it 
had 
c la y wa lls .  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Clay walls, bitter cold. Hunger. My aunt, who was very handy. She would 
knit things.T here was a blackm arket. So occasionally we had bread, which was a luxur y. And 

for dinner we hadthe potatof loating in water. 
 
 
My aunt was also picked up every day. Soldiers came andpickedher up i
n t he  
m orning to take her to labor camp. My m other,f or som e reason, was notforced to go. She 

stayed behindme andthat was really m y savi ng grace. I was never separatedf rom m y 

m other. Had Ibeen separated at that youngage, I don'tthinkI could have survived or wo uld 

have survi ved. 
 

 
My aunt and uncle and m other
-
in
-
law, they only stayed f or one yearwith us because 
their son was gro wing and kept on begging f or foodand they didn'thave much to give him . 

And at one time
 
--
 
I had never seenm y aunt angry
.  S
he got angry and said, 
ﬁW
hy can't you be 
like other children and steal?
ﬂ 
He said, 
ﬁ
I will n o t  s te a l.
ﬂ 
He wouldn't do that. So they lef t us so 
that we would have enough to sustain ourselves and they went to a diff erent labor cam p.
 

 
7
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They lef
t S
hargorot entirely?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. My uncle had listeria. There were no antibiotics. It was am azing that 
people still allowed usstay there.Butthank God he survived. T hey lef t. 
 
 
W hat kept us alive, too, and disease
-
f ree, was cleanliness. My mother would take 
the laundry tobe washed,abouta m ile and ahalf  down to the river. Oneday my cousinand I 
accompaniedher because we wanted
 
--
 
we had a rag dollf ora toy and little stones that we 
used.W hen we accompanied her to washour doll clothes, suddenly m y cousin said, "Oh, 
A
unt 
T ina, there's a little girl in the river." W ell, I hadf allen in.And m y mother didn't swim . And I 

didn't swim . But she thought very quickl y and she threw a sheet in.And I grabbed hold of it. 

But it was such a traum aticexperiencefor me that I couldn't speakfor at least three orf our 

days. T hey had got
 a  
witch. T here was som e wom an that cam e,anolder wom an, she cracked 
an egg open.This I rem em ber.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yo u  do r e m em be r  t hi s? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
I t  wa s  lik
e an abracadabra and suddenly I spoke. So it worked.T he trick 
worked. Andthe cleanliness.
 
 
T here wasn't an off icial kindergarten. It was awom an who cam ef rom  our town and 
she decided the children, you know
 
--
 
as I said, death in the streets, starvation,
 
dogs running 
af ter you.To thisday I'm  f rightenedof  Germ an Shepherds. My f riend has a German Shepherd
. 

W henever she invitedus to dinner, she knew sh
e had to put her dog awa y because I just felt 

ver y ill at ease. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You mentioned you saw people who were dead.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
This ispeople who had starved todeath.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
T hey starved to death, absolutely. Infact,therewas a nephew of m y 
uncle's who cam ebutwe didn't have room .W ecouldn't take him  i
n.W e fed him  whatever we 
had.
 
 
Just to give an exam ple of  when I was in thatlittle preschool class so to speak. W e 
were taught ourf irstalphabet in Hebrew.W ehada show and tell. Iwas thrilled when I was 

able to say today I had a piece of bread. 
 
And 
children played in the streets. 
 
 
Another traumatic experience was m y grandm other died while we were there. Since 
I was the only grandchildren with her therebecausethe others lef t, and she had some white 

garm entsthat she hadthem  sohefor her. And I sa
id ,  "W hat  
is  th is ,  G
randm a?"  She said, 
"W ell, when I die, this is how
ﬂ 
--
 
we wear whit e shrouds.She had a little sackof  sand. I said, 
"W hat isthis?"  She said, "This is soilf rom  Israel." Becausethe Jewish practice, we're 

supposed to be buried with soil
 
and these undergarm ents. 
 
 
And what was very dif f icult, everything was in one room . She's theonly one I have a 
gra vesite f or. She also told m e, she said, 
ﬁ
I want you to light the candle when Idie.
ﬂ 
And she 
knew. T wo daughterswere in Am erica, whom  she hadn't seen again. One daughter left.She 

hadthef eeling m y father would never come back. Ibelieve shehadstomach cancerbutthere 

were no doctors or anything there. I rem em ber when she died, which was very dif f icult
, t
he 
ritual com m ittee came and took careof  her body right in front ofm e. Butat thetim e they didn't 

believe in taking children to the cem etery so I didn't seethef inal steps. That was ver y diff icult.

You lived inthese circum stances you describedforus, and you're just to
uc h i n g 
the surface,f or three years in this setting with  alm ost nof oodtoeatmostof thetime as you 

described. Im arvel that despiteall of  that there was an attem pt to keep your education going. 

Having a little classroom .T hat's just incredible tom e, 
under those circum stances.

[Laughter]

Soaf ter three years in these circum stances inShargorot, theSoviets returned, 
only this tim e they came back as liberators.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell uswhat you can about the arrival of the Russians and then what that 
m eantfor your mother, your aunt, and you. Now you're under the 
Russians
a
nd their authority.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Right.W ell, in 1944, the sounds of war cam e very close. And tothis day I 
hate loud noises orbanging. A landlord
,  
soto speak, them an who took us in
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Intheir little hom e.
 
>> Rit a  Ru b in
stein:
 
Yes.W e understood that the f ront was com ing. So he took us to a 
neighbor who had a cellar, to be safef rom  the bom bing. It was like asub
-
basement. W e f elt 
saf e there. But there was a youngm an who couldn't stand itany longer. You know, the sounds
 
were louder and louder.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Theartiller y and thebom bings and all of that.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. Yes. He had to getout. He wanted to see what was happening. He 
wanted to investigate. And everybody was af raid thathe would be shotor bea 
victim  to the  

bombing but he cam eback allexcited
, s
aidthe Russian soldiers are in the streetsdrinking. 
Andeverybody thought he was hallucinating.Indeed, when we walk ed out, we saw
 
--
 
we al l 
cried tearsof  joy. And,of course, now where should we go?
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
You said tom ethat when they cam e inand they we re celebrating, essentially 
you were f reeto go, whatever thatm eant. You were f ree to go.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes.W e weref ree to go. W ecried tears of  joy but we started preparing for 
a  jo
urney home. My mother wanted to see if her parents survi ved. W e wanted to see if my 
father cam eback.W eknew we weren't wanted.T he anti
-
S em it is mwa s  s t ill t h e re .  B ut  we  
wanted to see ourhome.
 
 
W hen we got there, we could not get into ourhouse. It was usedby the Russians as 
a sort of a silo.T hey had grain stored there. Inf act,m y m other had to beg them  to lether in. 

She said," All I wantare photographs that I hid." And " My husbandfought in your Arm y
. P
lease 
let me." And they did.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Th
ankGod thephotos were still there.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
T he photos were still there.T hat's how I cam e by the photos. Since we 
couldn't get in there, som ebody intervened.My great grandparents had ahouse, which was 

occupied by the soldiers, f orced them to let us in and have a house there.
 
 
Also, m y aunt
 
--
 
therewas another righteousgentile.T here were righteous gentiles,

thank God.T hat's why quite afew of us did survi ve. I wish there were m ore.T henm illions 
would not have perished andbeenm urdered.
 
 
So we tookam ilitary tr ain back home to Czer nowitz. And Bella,m om 's sister, she 
went out to scoutoutVascautiandf ound a wom an who hadbeen ateacher in her small town. 

She was the daughterof  apriest andher husband was a Ukrainiannational evader. 
So he 

helped us get on themilitary train and helpedus get back to Vascauti. He's the one thatforced 

them  to provide shelter for us, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know, once you had shelter,how your auntand your mother were able 
to start tom ake endsm eet so you could at least eat? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How did they do thosethings?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
My aunt started working in abank. Ihad m yf irst taste of  school. It was a 
Ukrainian school, which was about a m ileand ahalf away. I had tolearn Ukrainian. Inf act, 

they didn't celebrate Christm asas such but they called it [Indiscernible], which is Father 

Christm as.They had a big tree in the class, in the school. Ihad to recite apoem  in Ukrainian. I 

learned it. But I was scared to death. You know, the atm osphere was
 
not great.W e were 
indoctrinat
ed to love Stalin. Stalin's picture was all over theplace. He was our savior
,  
so to 
speak.W e had to kisshim  and give, you know
 
--
 
it was not a good tim e to stay there.W ehad 
a f eeling 
that the IronCurtain would set in and they wouldn't let usout.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
At that tim e, at Christm as time, Decem ber
 
1944,of  coursefor you in thatarea 
the war is over but the war, of  course, would continue elsewhere until May. Do you know if  the 

a
dults knew what was going on with the war elsewhere and didthey know what hadhappened 
to Jews all over Europe? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Unfortunately, yes, we f oundout. Andm y father
 
--
 
a f riend cam e back 
home.That'show we k now the exactdate when he was killed. He told us when he was shot. 

But at least Ihave theknowledge of  knowing thatm yf ather was in them ilitary f ighting against 

the Germans.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And was killed in come combat.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Killed in combat. And unfortunately m et with m y grandparents' neighbors. 
My grandfather was aver y 
p
ious m an, very gentle. They alsohad adry goods store. Andhe 
would gi ve his customers credit,especially at Christm astim e when they neededproduceand 

things.W ell, the sam e neighbors andf riends
, 
so to speak
 
--
 
there was a special exhibit 
outside
 
--
 
right here on thisf loor. Neighbors aref riends. I subm itteda picture of my f atherwith 
a his custom ers inthe Ukrainian costumes. 
 
 
T hey were f riends.T hey appreciated all
 
--
 
and the same thing with
 
m y grandf ather. 
And these sam ef riends
,  
so to speak,they turned onm y father
 
--
 
I mean grandf ather and his 
fam ily. Theneighbor gave a blow
-
by
-
blo w description to m y mother. My grandparentsm etwith 
their death.T hey usedfarm  im plem ents.They let m y grandfather witness how they killed his 

wif e andf our children. It was a horrible
 
--
 
here m y mother was in her 20's. She learned she 
becam ea widow. Shehad only six wonderfulyears with m y father. She lost herparents. She 

hadone surviving sister. It was horrible.W hen she heard thenews, she just torethe earrings 

outof  her ears. She was a very strong wom an to withstandall of  that. She was always wor r ied 

about losing m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And we may turn to that a little bit later when we com eto the United
 
S t at es .
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soasyou said, now you're under Stalin,the Iron Curtain is closing. So you, 

 
10
 
your m other, your aunt and you, were abletoescapef rom  Com munist Romania. You were 
able to leave andended up going to adisplaced persons camp inGerm any. T ell us how you 

escaped the Comm unists and were ableto get away and what happened once you lef t 

Rom ania andhow you left Rom ania.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
W ell, we hadfalsif ied papers saying that we were citizens of  Poland, that 
we were born inPoland.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And do you have any idea how you were even able to getf alse papers?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
I have no idea.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your motherand aunt?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
I think there was a Jewish underground.I have no idea, really. Too young. 
T hey didn't share it with me.
 
 
My m other after the war, you know, some people just couldn't talk about it. Infact, 
she was againstm y telling m y children aboutm y story. I thought it was very im portant to tell. 

Some survivors to this
 
day can't speakof  the unspeakable becausethey were in the terrible 
concentration cam ps.My stor y is pretty tough alsobut nothing compared to the concentration 

cam ps thatm y f riendswere in.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Rita , I th in k tha t, if I rem em be r righ t, you t
old m e that your m other and your 
aunt were actually advised to leave to try to get out.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ye s .  Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They were told you needto leave here.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Aswe were leaving, we were on the train
 
--
 
this is another won
derful 
righteous gentile. A soldier who was in charge of  the train knew us because hism other was a 

m idwif e tom y grandmotherand helped todeliver som e of m y aunts. Buthedidn't say a word. 

W hen he lookedat our docum ents,he knew we were Rom anian, right. And we were on the 

train about to leave, and m y aunt was still notin sight becausethey held her in the bank. They 

did not want to lether go. At the last m inute, like 10m inutesbeforewe were to leave, they 

f inally let her go and she arrived and we wer e on the train. And that was a long, long journey. 

T hat I remember.
 
W ewent out illegally, really. W e traveled.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Of  course you did. You were leaving with f alse papers.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. The journey took usabout threem onths.W e had to cross borders. 
W e po s ed
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
This was your m otherand aunt really doing all of this. 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. Yes. And m y other aunt,m yf ather's sisterandherfam ily. It was very, 
ver y hard to journey.Wehad todo it atnight.W e hoppedon coal trains because we didn't 

have tickets.W edidn't have money.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Am I correct, though,that inall of  thatterrible circum stancesand horribleness 
a goodthing happened to your Aunt Bella on the train?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ye s .  Ye s .  W h
en we were in one holding place, in hiding, she mether 
wonderful husband there, yes. He was the sole survi vor. He camef rom Lithuania. He was in 

Auschwitz, too. He was a sole survi vor in his fam ily exceptf orone cousin who was in the 

partisan m ovem ent. A
nd shem ethim there.And they married. Hewas like a surrogatef ather 
tom e, sucha good man. He was wonderf ul.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Did you all go together to thedisplaced persons camp?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Actually, they went to a differentone.T he displaced persons camps were 
not plush camps, either. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They were 
r ef u ge e c am p s .
 

 
11
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Right. But at least we finally had schools.T hose of  you whoare students, 
they wonder. I loved going to school.I had athirstf or knowledge.
 
>> B i
ll Benson:
 
And becam e a teacher and principal.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
T ha t ' s  r i gh t
. T
o this day Ijust love children. I always have loved children. 
T hank GodI'm blessed with children andblessed with eight grandchildren. Because I've lost 
m y childhood, essen
tially, I loved playing with m y daughtersand with m y grandchildren 
especially
, especially d
o lls
. 
I would sitfor hours playing Barbies. BecauseI was lacking that. I 
was a kid atheart. Even atm y age I stillf eel a kid atheart. Can't say how old am  I. 
O k? 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hileyou were in the displaced persons camp, several things happened.One 
is you got quite sick.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Yes. Ok.W ell, thedisplaced persons camp, I just want to say, was like l if e 
reborn.Babies were born. In Bergen
-
Belsen
, for instance, there were 2,000 babies born.There 
were a lot of  weddings. There were special events.There were shows in the school
.  
I loved 
being on sage. I was singing. I didn'thave training butI had a pretty good voice. 
 
 
So while I was on stage
 
--
 
I just want to relate this story. My m othersat next to a 
lady and while I was singing the wom an said, " Oh, I wonder if this child's mother is still alive."  

Andm y m other turnedto her and she said, " Iam , thank God."  She said, 
ﬁI
 
ha d a  lit t le  girl ju s t  
li
ke her and she was killed.
ﬂ  
 
 
And whenIm etm any of m y f riends, som e of m y f riends who were in hiding by Pols 
and some convents, they could not speaka word of  Yiddish. So inorder f ormeto 

comm unicate with them , I learned Polish. And m y mother used to 
meet people in the streets 

and they started speaking Polish to her. She said, 
ﬁ
I don't speak Polish.
ﬂ ﬁ
How com e your 
daughter speaks?
ﬂ 
But as a child, you grasp languages and learn them  very quickl y. But as 
quickl y as I learned it Iforgottenall of  it.
 
 I  
f ormed some wonderful friendships. AndIf oundtwo f riendsf rom  DP campshere in 
the UnitedStates.That was quite a reunion.W ehad a special experience. I will never f orget
 
--
 
oh, yeah, back to your question. Many of  us,of  course, becauseof  the wonder
ful nutrition we 
had, we cam e down wi th m any diseases.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 T
uberculosis in your case.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
I had tuberculosis andmy m other was not inf orm ed right away so it gr own. 
I was sent to a sanitarium  and I spent nine months
 
--
 
>> B ill B e
nson:
 
Away f rom  your mom.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
I was 10 years old,away from m y m om  ina pretty anti
-
S e m it ic  s an it a rium  
where nurses would give m e
 
--
 
they saidthiswould hurt.They did all kinds of testing to see if  
things would work. I needed Streptom ycin
 
that at thetim e they only gave to patients who 
s uf f e r ed  f r om  TB of  t h e b o ne .
 
My m other didwrite to f am ily m em bers and they f inally did send 
Streptom ycin. But at that time I was on the operating table already where they collapsed one 

lung.W e were scared
 
when we would em igrate because they didn'thave [Indiscernible].They 
would exam ine you, gave you a full healthexam ,bef ore you even went on the ship. But we'll 

touch on that later. It was very dif f icult. Yes. Ionly saw m y m other once a week. She tooka
 

train.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I can't im aginehow awf ul thatm usthave beenf or both of  youand your m other 
to be away f or thatperiod of time.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Itwas. M y m other said she wished she had savedm y letters becauseI 
consoled her. I was in quarantine. She didn'tknow that. First tim e she cam e to visit she was 

lookingf or me amongst the children and they said, no, she's in quarantine. So Ihad apretty 

 
12
 
advanced caseof  it.
 
But there was one very gentle doctor.She was Danish.She told m y 
m other not
 
to worry; sh e had hadTB
. S
hehad afam ily, got married. She consoledher so to 
speak. But, yes, it was quite diff icult.
 
 
But inGermany, the school also
 
--
 
what I wanted to say, we lived in the barracks, the 
sam e barracks where the SS soldiers were trained.W e hadone room  but it was plush.W e 
had canned goodsf rom  the UnitedStates. And thedistributions helpeda lot. Ialso had som e 

social workers who cam e to visit m e in the hospital.And they broughtm e embroidery. That 

was so nice.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I s
m iled because you shared with m e that you would get the canned goods 
f rom  the United Statesso you would get canned spam. And then what would you do with it?
 

>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
My stepfather took the spam , and the canned tunaf ish
; h
e would barter. 
He would go out. He didn't go on theblackmarket like som e other people made money but at 

least we had f ood. So he got f resh chicken.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
T raded spam  f or f resh chicken. 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Right. Right. Tunaf ish in a can, we just never heard of it.So we didn't 
to u ch tha t. 
 
 
He wasn't president then but General Eisenhower cam e to our camp. I was 
unf ortunately in the 
sanitarium
 
then but m y good f riend who played p
iano said, ﬁ
I played for 
GeneralEisenhower when he visited our camp.
ﬂ 
>>
 
Bill Benson:
 
W ow. I didn't know that. Andwhile you were in thedisplacedpersons cam p, 
Israel got its independence. You rem em berthat.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Oh, m y gosh.T hat was the mostm em orable experience.W hen we 
children heard
 
--
 
th o s e of  u s,  t he  r em
nantsof the Holocaust who survi ved, where do you go? 
Like the song, "T ell m e where shall I go," every door was closed to us, to the lef t to the right. 

T here was noplacefor m e. It was true.W e had no place.Israel was not independent. It was 

Palestine then. So in 1948, May
 
15, when we heard the news that we were f inally had a 
country to go to
 
--
 
becausethe other countries did not wantus. Nobody wanted us. Infact, 
there was the 
--
Saint
 
Louis who tried to save people who had a lotof money, cam etoall t
he  
ports.T hey were turned away. T hey were even turned away by the United States. But thank 

God, you know, that's in the past. So it was awonderful newsf or our school.W
e ha d  a
 
b onf i r e .  
I remember staying up all night long.W e were dancing and singing for joy that wef inally had a 

country. But, of course, I hadfam ily in the United States.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You would come many years before.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
My m ot h e r's on ly sist e r
 
--
 
we had a quota system
 
--
 
cam e up f irst. So she 
left. Shedidn't even see me in the s
anitarium  b
ecause she left shortly af ter. I was in the DP 
c a m p f r om  
`
46 to 
`4
9.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Three years.
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Even thoughm y desire was to goto Israel but I'm  glad
 
--
 
she said, no, 
you're m y only child; we are going to the United States. I was very glad to make the choice 

a n ywa y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatwas it like to com e here, 1949, to the UnitedStates? 
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Oh, I didn't tell you about m y horrible journey. Oh,m y God. It was nota 
cruise ship, let m e tell you
 
that. It was an Army [Indiscernible]. By coincidence, whenm y 
husband was drafted into theArm y
 
--
 
he was only 16 buthis parents wrote him four years 
older. He was on the sam e ship. It was during the Korean crisis wh en they sent him to 

 
13
 
Germ any, the General Haan. So I shared
 
--
 
itwas m eant tobe. But the journey was awf ul.W e 
were with them achines. There were bunkbeds. My m other saidtake the top bunkbed. It's a 
good thing she did because we were sick theentire two weeks.T heocean was very rough in 

S
eptember. I don't think m y m other andI went toa dining room once. Som ebody brought us 
som e grapef ruit.
 
 
But landing, right before landing in New York,  to see that wonderf ulStatue of Liberty. 
W e wentupondeck.Irem ember standing there. I still get emotional when I think about it.W e 

were f inally f ree to practice our religion. It's aplace where we received thehum blem asses 

yearning to bef ree.W e were f inally f ree.
 
I'mnot saying that
 
--
 
I didn't experience 
anti
-
Sem itism. I know there was some here,too. But com ing to New York with a majority of 
people being Jewish
, a
nd, of  course, a lot of  non
-
Jews, notprejudice or anything, or 
anti
-
S em it ic
, i
t was a wonderfulf eeling. I don't think I'll ever get thatfeeling again.
 
Of course it 
was wonderf ul when we
 
became parents andgrandparents, but thiswas just so different. Af ter 
all the suffering, that the country opened its doors tous. It's really the land of opportunity. W e 

don't know how lucky we are but
 
--
 
we can criticize.W e arefree to critici ze.W edo
 
have our 
f reedom s here. T hat's wh y ever ybody wants to com e
 r
ea lly.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Rita, your mother was protective of  you.And when you cam e tothe United 
States, after all youhad beenthrough shebecam e in your words, really over protective.
 
>> Rit a  Ru
binstein:
 
Yes. She becam e very over protective. Shedidn't want m e to go ice 
skating. Of  course I didn't know how to rideabike because Ididn't have one. I didn't know how 

to swim .W hat was good for me was when Iattended Brooklyn College
 
--
 
there's anot
her thing. 
It's the land of opportunity.W e hadnothing.W equalif ied to go onwelfare but it was sh
un
ned, 

m eaning it was a shame so youdid not do that. So we worked hard.My
 
--
 
in Germ any, an 
Auschwitz sur vi vor wh o losthis wif e and sonin Auschwitz, bec
ame a house painter. And m y 
m other worked briefly in a 
candy 
f a ct
ory, like where you see Lucille ball. [Laughter] So we 
m anaged.W e wouldn't take any m oney.
 
 A
nd,of  course, sincewe didn't havem oney, even though
 
--
 
oh, what I wanted to 
say, how hard it was as an im m igrant. I didn't speak a word of English. Housing was very 

diff icult. My Aunt Bella who had hadherdaughter was born in 
`
48, she tookus in.There were 
three of  us. She had a one
-
bedroom apartm ent. She lived in the Midwood sectionof Brooklyn 
which 
I  
thought was a rich section at the timebecause people owned hom es then in m y class. 
And they put me ina special class.W hy they did, Idon't know. T hey didn't know how sm art I 

was. But it was sink orswim . I didn'topen upm y m outhfor threem onth
s
, u
ntil I spoke English. 
And they gave m e an I.Q. test. Hedidn't know a shoem akerf rom a tailor and it was very 

f rustrating.
 
 
T he reasonI'm  relating this story, when I was in high school, the principal calledme 
into the off ice
. A
nd I knew I was a good
 
student. I couldn't im agine.Andhe said tom e,I don't 
understand how anybody's I.Q. would go up so much.I said, listen, Isaid, you gave an I.Q.

If

>> Rita Rubinstein:
 
Ok. First of  all,I'd liketo thankGod that we survi ved oneof  thedarkest 
periods in history. I'm  grateful tothe United Statesfor opening its doors to us. It's really the 

greatest country in theworld.W e shouldappreciatethef reedom s that we have and the 

opportunities. I'm  proud tobea U.S. citizen. I'm  very patriotic, asm y kids know. I still get lum ps 

i n  m y t
hroat every tim e I see the flag and star
-
spangledbanner.I thank God. And I thankour 
m en and wom en in the m ilitary f or the sacrif ices that they have made in protecting our 

f reedom s we shouldall be gratefulf orthat.
 
 
W emust remem ber the past. Find courage in thefuture.W edon't wantour past to 
be our children'sf uture. I hope I never see starvation or war, and none of  youdo. You should 

never stand silent. Allspeakup when you witness bullying and prejudicism .W eare all God's 

people. It doesn't matter what color or what religion. Always take astand. Do the right thing. 
 

Hate is never right. And love is never wrong. W hen you save oneperson's life, it'sas though 

you've saved the world's.
 
 
I'm  dedicating today's program  to, of course,m y f am ily andthe 11
 
m illio n
 
--
 
it wa sn 't 
just Jews who perished in the Holocaust
 
--
 
who were brutally m urdered, not killed.
 
I  will 

 
15
 
continue to tell m y story. I hope that you will tell your children that you meta real life survivor 
and it
 
did happen. Because there are a
 
lotof deniersof  the Holocaust who say this didn't 
happen. It sure did happen. I lost a lot off am ily m em bers. Im issed having grandparents.And 

that's why I bend over backwards. I think I'm a pretty good grandmother. I have two 

grandchildren here. I lov
e m y grandchildren to pieces. And Ihave been blessed, truly blessed
, 
t
hatI've survi ved the Holocaust.
 
Of course, Iquestion why did I survive. Som etim es we have 
gu ilt  f ee lin gs .  
 

 
I do wantto thank m ywonderfulf acilitator. Ialwa ys ask for Bill Benson. 
He's been 
wonder
ful. And everybody here, Em ily Potter. It's very im portant. I've been doing thisfor 
alm ost 10 years. Atf irst I was toobusy but it's ver y re warding. I read. It's very diff icult. I 

translate documents and diaries. Some of the storiesare horrible but Ifeel it's m y duty 

because we want topass it ontofuture generations.
 
 
I have hope in thefuture. I seeall of  you young people. Just tell them  the story. It 
really happened. And it should never happen in any country. T here are still Holocau
s t s go i ng 

on inthe world now. Breaks m y heart when Isee pictures of children in Syria and what 

happened in Rwanda.It's all over the world. Andanti
-
S em it ism  unf o rt u n at e ly is  s t ill o n  t he ris e .
