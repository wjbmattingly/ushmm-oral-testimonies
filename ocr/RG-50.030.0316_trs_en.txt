JACK BRAUNS and AVRAHAM TORY 
September 27, 1991 
 
B:My father is an apprentice to 
shoema ker.  That gave him the ri
ght to go to high school, and my 
father went to high school and he was an excelle
nt student.  And the director of that high 
school was my father's protege.  And he 
was en...always encouraged my father to 
continue higher education.  My father fini
shed the high school with
 the highest in...in 
Dorpet with the highest ma rks, and had a 
really new problem....a Jewish problem which 
was to enter a university.  He wanted to st
udy me dicine.  He want
ed to study me dicine 
and for a Jew to enter Dorpet university wa
s one of the most di
ffi cult things.  More 
difficult it was for me  or anybody else to ente
r in the modern time in a me dical school.  
And at that time  my gran
dfather had a cousin who was one of the one who was 
kidnapped on the street, and was a Russian so
ldier for 25 years, enlisted.  He had no 
children and he, the cousin of my
 grandfather, had a legal righ
t to enroll his children to a 
Russian university.  But he was not the father 
of my father.  Therefore, it was worth my 
grandfather who was the Rabbi...Rabbi in the li
ttle town of Velendi did some thing which 
is really...I consider thinki
ng about it, very humiliating for him.  He had to declare 
himself me ntally insane, not able to take car
e of his son, and legally transferred the right 
to his cousin to adopt him and take care of 
him.  My grandfather who was a very learned 
ma n and a very sharp ma n did it for my father.  As a re
sult my father succeeded in enter            
university as a faculty of me dicine.  Uh...After
 a year or 2 at the university of Tarto, my 
father succeeded to be accepted to Cologne
, the Cologne University in Germany, where 

he completed me dicine and...uh...had a excellent 
education.  He ma rried my mother was 
was from Ri ga, and they both settled in Ka
unas in 1940 and my ...excuse me ...my father 
became...uh...interested in contagious diseases, 
and was in charge of the hospital, in the 
Jewish hospital of the contagious disease departme nt.  In 1940, approxima tely 6 weeks 

before the World Wa r II started, a epidemic of
 typhus developed in the city of Vilnos.

And my father was dispatched to be in 
charge of the epidemic in Vilnos where 
he...uh...directed the treatm
ent of the thousands of people who got sick.  On the day of 
the war in...in...he...on a Sunday when the war br
oke up, that was the day when he came  
to Kaunas.  And when he tr
aveled in the train he stil
l did...didn't know that the war 
started.  Wh en the war started...uh...he again wa
s in charge of the 
contagious disease 
hospital in...in the ghetto.  In...in...I'm sorry, 
in...in...in Kaunas.  And in August when the 
Germans ha ve ordered the...uh...the Germans ha
ve ordered the move me nt of the Jews 
into the ghetto...uh...my father had the task in 
organizing the contagious disease hospital 
in the ghetto.  Now, Avr a ham, as you know at that time , and you were the Secretary of 
the Judenrat, you probably know... 
 

T:There was no Judenrat.  There was 
an Altestenrat, a Jewish Council. 
 

B:I'm sorry.  A Jewish Council.   

 

T:In Vilna, there was a Jude
nrat.  In Kovno, there was not. 
 

B:Okay.  In the Altestenrat,  how was the mech
anism and what role my father pl ayed in the 
beginning in the ghetto, a
nd later in the ghetto? 
 

T:Yes.  Uh...I me ntioned in ma ny...in ma ny occas
ions, the important  role that...uh...your father, 
Dr. Moses Brauns, played in the ghettofrom its very beginning because...uh...30,000 

Jews were ordered to mo ve in the sma
ll area of the suburb of Slobodka, which was 

inhabited about 8 thousand norma lly, and now
 30 thousand Jews had to...to be squeezed 
in an un...impossible density, and this crea
ted the first...the fi
rst big problem of 
contagious diseases because Slobodka was 
a very fa mous...uh...a very famous suburb 
from the point of view of                   
           big scholars were world fa mo us.  But it wa s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316

one of the most neglected suburbs.  There 
was no...no sewage, no water, not any of the 
military installations and that's why there wa
s no, for instances, toilets.  There was not 
such houses....houses were small ones.  One...one story... story houses of wooden.  There 
were in...in all of Slobodka, were appr
oxima tely two or three big...uh...houses of...of 
...three story houses with bricks.  Others we
re mostly wooden of...of one story or two 
stories.  So this in itself brought about 
it that ma ny Jews were...fled from Kovno to the 
ghetto, didn't find there housing.  And th
e housing departme nt was...was...uh...was 
in...was not able to ...to ...l
ocate houses.  When I talk about houses, we speak about a 
room.  We s peak about a part of a room, a 
dwelling.  And this too was there were so 
ma ny thousands were in the streets under the 
sky.  And others...we used to... we used to 
house them the...the roofless we used to house them in previous
 synagogues or Yeshivites                    
but they were packed to capacity and you           to a for mer school as I did with the head 
of the            departme nt.  At that time  
         , we were looking for a place where we 
could install a hospital, a general hospital.  So
 not only in the...in the rooms, the family 
sleep but only in the staircase.  Only in the...in 
the...the toilets.  In the ...in the... in the...in 
the upper floor where it was only for storage, 
there also lived people.
  And this created 
imme diately danger for contagious diseases.  Th
e...the Lithuanian san
itary departme nt of 
Kovno was searching where they were spying in
 the ghetto just to 
look and pick up one 
case of a contagious diseases.  It was typhus
 or some thing we've had.  And there were 
such, because it was impossible, but also in
 this we called them reservats  where 
hundreds of fa milies lived in one place, a 
formal Shivot or formal synagogue.  And 
when...the...happened such a thing, there was no po
ssibility to...to isolate the sick one, so 
Doctor Brauns was the one who had two tasks in
 one time.  First of all, to help give 
me dical care to the contagious sick person.  
Second to isolate him fr
om the rest of the 
people in the reservat, which was full packed, 
and where to put him...put him at a bed that 
there was no such a bed even on the...on the 
ground, but to isolate him fr om the others.  
Second, he was the one who served as addres
s for those Lithuanians, municipal spies I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316

say, me dical spies or sanitary spies who came 
to Dr. Brauns, and they asked him how the 
situation...where are your contagious diseases. So he said, "We don't  have any."  And he 

was duty bound as head of the...of the...the Depa
rtme nt for Contagious 
Diseases to report 
to the municipality in Kovno, to the health 
departme nt of Kovno, and they would have 
come .  In addition German Police, the Gestapo, 
on their own initiative, used to come  to 
the ghetto and search.  On the spot they used 
to go into the reservot.  They used to go 
in...in...uh...they used to go in the... 
 

B:The houses? 

 

T:Private dwellings.  Houses.  Dwellings.  Corridors.
  Court yards.  They were packed.  But Dr. 
Brauns used to take out of 
such places the diseases and found some  other places in a 
very...in a small hut, and it was much like as if it
 is just a hut, but inside the court yard, he 
used to...he built with them, and this separated 
them from the others.  Always the night, 
he was the buffer, I could say to...he was to 
rebuff...to rebuff the attacks of the Germans, 
of the Lithuanians, not less than the 
Germans from spying...from spying where the 
contagious ill people are.  This was...this wa
s supposed to be the motive to liquidate all 
the ghetto because if there is a contagious 
diseases in the ghetto, we wind on the other 
side of the...of the...of the 
free...free part of the barbed 
wire, there was a Lithuanian 
population, also in the...in the very same  s m
all suburb.  So they...excuse that they would 
be a danger to the Lithuanian population.  Th
ey would even be a danger for the German 
soldiers passing by.  And he stood firm.  
First of all it was a very big morale 
responsibility to cure.  There 
were excellent physicians in 
the ghetto.  Surgery...and in out 
this is and out this is, and whatever not a very
 specialist in me dicine.  But not one of them 
was ready to take over the risk 
and deal with, cure this dis
eases of typhus and so on.  The 
only who took it over and did hisself the very great, not only respect, 
but the trust of the 
Jewish Committee, the Council.  Dr. Elkes, the 
head of the Jewish Council.  We 'r e  great 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316  
5 
 
friends.  They wrote for long years.
  It was a long standing, long year 
standing...uh...uh...friendship.  And that's  why they
 trusted him fully.  He was the...the 
ma n, the doctor who was the only one whom 
the Jewish Council relied upon to protect 
the ghetto inmates from first of
 all contagious diseases in...
in themselves a danger, and 
for the other one to stand courageous...cour
ageous and steady right to...to reject and 
to...to buff back all these questions, some times
 cynical questions, some ti mes provocative 

questions, some  provocative unexpected visits
.  And when Dr. Brauns was...went in the 
ghetto and he me t on...on the streets of this    
      and he recognized...and he recognized 
the Lithuanian physicians who came and 
they knew what they came for.  And 
imme diately just interfered, they told them, "Please, wher
e are you.  What are you doing?   
Please come .  You ought to see my hospital.  Please and so on."  But he knew them.  

They wanted some ti me s to a avoid meeting with him, and to reach 

exactly...uh...the...the...uh...the            itsel f, the sick ma n who was sick with typhus.  And 
this is a task that will be written always 
in the annals of the 
three years of the Kovno 

Ghetto.  I don't know of a
ny other such person, physician, who took upon hims elf the 
daily risk of life, his own life, in fi
ght from...from both parts.  This, you know, 
the..uh...the Czars emblem was a two...two heads...uh...two h
eads of a...of a                  . 
 

B:Eagle. 

 

T:Eagle.  Two of the m.  And Dr. Brauns, I coul
d say he had...he had two parts of Dr. Brauns.  
One part they wrote it to his fellow inmates 
in the ghetto.  Protect them from the very 
diseases.  He's  a doctor, a physician.  And 
on the part, the second Dr. Brauns who stood 
on the outlook everyday against the Germans, spie
s, against the warnings, the threats that 
they used to say Dr. Brauns, "You are the pe
rson who are responsible 
to report to us and 
if you will not report you bear responsibil
ity yourself."  And you know what it means 
responsibility?   This me ans just death.  No comp romi se.  
And I'm not exaggerating.  So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316  
6 
 
this is the wa y you, Dr. Brauns, in the ghett
o...he knew very well because on the...he used 
to come  to the very...very urgent cases, the very
 especially hard cases.  When four or five 
got sick with contagious diseases at one time,
 we used to find imme diately to take them 
out from where they been and bring themin certain places we didn't know where.  

Because we didn't have such hotels or  some wher e to bring them there.  But then we used 

to take even a hut or some thing like that, 
take out the dwelling...t
he...the citizens, the 
inma tes and put in these...uh...under very strong and some ti mes we used to put on the 

outlook on this...on this hiding... hiding hospital 
you see, uh...the outlook, two or three 
policemen...Jewish policemen on the outlook soif some body come s close, near to it.  

This I how I knew Dr. Brauns and I cannot but 
end this...uh...this characte
ristic that in the 
course of the years I knew Dr. Brauns from the   
          from the Kovno Ghetto?   He wa s 
the President, but            the French
 was really...uh...really was 
developed in the ghetto 
and it was only nature that after the liberation 
when I was already in Israel and I got word 
that...uh...this Jew came to...we were in Dachau, 
we were in concentration camp, and then 
we were in Italy.  We  we re...we were together in the 1945, 1947.  You stayed there until 

later I...I ma de my           October 47.  So that you came to...to America, you succeeded 
to...to...to study me dicine and es
tablish yourself as a well known physician in the United 
States and then to learn from you when you vi
sited Israel, you came 
to me and told me 
that your father and mother were rescued.  
They survived and they are in... in Soviet 
Union and you are trying to bring them out 
and what can I do for you in this case?  I 
while in Italy I was the Secretar
y of the clandestine Aleia to 
Palestine.  But we at that 
time already used to send our me ssenge
rs inside Russia to take out from 
there...uh...Zionist...forme r Zionist leaders and bring 
them to Italy and then to Israel.  So I 
had all the connections how to take out from Ru
s s ia to Palestine...to 
Palestine...to Israel.  
And it was a fact that I was the only one in Isra
el that dealt with it and when they used to 
come  to...to...uh...we used to come  to the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs for help, they told 

them go to Avraham Tory, the lawyer,  and th
ey thought they have to come  to Tory and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316

obey me .  See and so on, I never took a penny for that.  And mi nd you, the President of 
the State of Israel, Heil Weitzma n, had a sister
 that rema ined in th
e Soviet Union.  And 
then Vera Weitzma n, who was a very you know
 a lady and she was with the all the 
Ambassadors over there, so she spoke with 
the Russian Ambassador, they'r e bringing 
in...in Wa shington and she was here and she 
spoke with the French Ambassador there 
and here.  And they asked.  Nothing came out.  So then I don't know some way they got 

word that Avraham Tory is dealing with bri
ng the...the...the Jews from Soviet Union to 
Israel.  I was the first one to bring Pnina's fa
ther who was in Siberia,
 exiled, to bring him 
the first one in 52.  To bring him in...from...fro
m Siberia to Israel.  
And I had there...when 
I...when I got word that  he's already in Mo
scow, I...I spoke to th
e Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and they called the Embassy in Moscow
 they shouldn't beat him because he is 70 
years old ma n.  Anyhow, so the...one of the fa m
ily of the President came to my office and 
asked me  could I do anything about this?   A
nd I told them...gave them one advice.  If 
they want me to deal with to bring th
e sister of the President, Heim Weitzman, 
to Israel,                
they should not me ntion a word about the Pres
ident, about Heim Weitzma n, about Israel.  
Nothing!  A plain         
 woma n comes...comes is...is in Ru
ssia.  She has a sister.  It's  
me ntion because               in...in Israel.    
       Only the sister should apply.  And in their 
name  I applied for a exit visa for this woma n, 
and the...after 6 months she came to Israel.  
And then I got a very nice letter, nice but it so 
          .  But when your father came to 
Israel, came to...to...came to Russia, I told
 you the same  thing.  You cannot get your 
father out of the Soviet Union 
and bring him straight from the Soviet Union to America.  
I suggest to you you formerly be...live in Isra
el.  And I took your car
d and I put it on my 
private home as if you lived together with me  in Israel.  A
nd they gave you the ...the...the 

aerograms...Israeli post office and you used to
 write the aerograms and send them in a 
closed envelope to me , and I used to put it in
 the...in the post office in Tele Aviv.  And 
the same  thing your parents used to write 
the letters to you, but send it to...to Jacob 
Brauns, Tele Aviv, 17 Aldair St
reet, Tele Aviv, Israel.  And 
I used to send it to you.  And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316  
8 
 
by so doing I succeeded to get 
the permit for your parents to come  to Israel.  And it 
happens so that when my wife went to Be
rkeley where our olde
st daughter was studying 
at University and she was...was to give birt
h to a...to a child, that
 wife was visiting you 
and you were host, and you took her to Los Vegas and I don't know where.  And that date 
I got...I went to the airport of Lud to meet 
your fa ther and mother and took them to my 
home .  They were speaking very slow because they shouldn't hear...somebody wouldn't 

hear this way...how they...they way they were 
frightened to talk to some body.  And, of 
course, after several months or so th
ere, you...you...you took them over to the United 
States.  And this is the happy end of Dr. Moses 
Brauns with his father
 and with his father, 
and of course the...the friendship continued w
ith Dr. Brauns and his wife when they were 
here in Los Angeles, and this friendship 
grows on with you, and with your fa mily.  
 

B:I want to add some thing.  Being...we have two t
opics.  We  have topic of the ghetto, and topic 
of getting my parents out.  I like to add an in
teresting story to that.  When Mrs. Kruschev 

happened to be in the United States, I 
was lucky enough to be introduced to Vice 
President Nixon.  I wrote a very passionate 
letter to Mrs. Nixon.  I compared two 
mothers.  She is a mother who has two sons and lost her son and my mother who 

unfortunate lost my brother, one of her sons
.  And this passionate letter wa s given by 
President Nixon to Mrs. Krushe
v, and within one week we got a permit.  However, what 
you have done, we have really together deceiv
ed and covered because my father always 
said when the ma il ma n used to come , he used to scream loud on the staircase, "Dr. 

Brauns, I have a letter from your son from Israel."  
So the          , the KBG, at that time  
has not... 
 

T:Had no idea. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316

B:Had no idea the big deception.  But the morale of
 the story is with your help, with Pr esident 
Nixon's help, with Mrs. Krushev's generosity 
and interest we succeeded it, in this big 
project to get my parents out.  Going back 
to the ghetto thing, I am recollecting a few 
things about the ghetto which was about about
...about the period you sa
id.  First of all, 
my father was heart broken when he had to ta
ke the patients from the contagious di sease 
hospital and bring them t o the 
ghetto.  They were transporte
d on open trucks.  They were 
sick people with high temperatur
e and they were dumped on the 
street.  It was at that time 
when my fat her had helped to organize or
 I mean help...with the help of the people 
because he made a smal l hospital of 50 beds
 which was called the contagious disease 
hospital.  The people everyone was very generous in the ghetto.  They had nothing, but 
each found a little sheet, 
a little pillow, an extra bed to
 fill a 50 bed hospital, which I 
personally was working in the hospital.  And I.
..the hospital become  a symbol of security 
for the people.  The people when the hospita
l felt that they feel secure.  And you know 
better Dr. Elkes got a warning about three days 
before the tragedy in the...in the hospital 
that they'r e planning to do some thing with the 
hospital.  My father went to the hospital 
and tried to discharge everybody. 
 And fort...I mean unfortunate...fortunately, the people 
in the hospital were not very sick.  They used 
it mostly as a shelter 
not to go to work.  But 
nobody wanted to leave the hospital.  And 
you described what happened on October 4th, 
1941, with this hospital which was one of the 
big tragedies.  My own life was and my  
father's life was saved by the fact there 
was a bridge to cross to the hospital. 
 

T:Up a bridge. 

 

B:An upper bridge I recall went 
over the highway, over the street 
or highway which was not part 
of the ghetto.  And for some  reason my fath
er never know who it was, there was a ma n 
who stopped him.  And my father... 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316  
10 
 
T:On his way to the...near
 the...near the bridge? 
 
B:Near the bridge.  And delayed 
us by 5 mi nutes.  That was the 
5 mi nutes that gave my father 
and me  life.  Why don't  you describe wh
at happened that tim
e at the hospital? 
 

T:We ll, I told already...spoke about it all I want.  
But what happened that Dr
. Brauns usually at 6 
o'clock, he was already walked to the ghetto, to
 the...to his hospital.  And they when they 
came to the...when they came  to this day at this 4th of October 1941, he came  to pass the 

bridge, they was already cl
osed.  Nobody come s into this small ghetto and nobody goes 
out.  In the small ghetto was the...the contag
ious disease hospital headed by Dr. Brauns 
and they didn't  let him in.   He says, "I am the doctor of the...of the hospital.  I must be 

there.  The pe ople are waiting."  Not nothing.  And you accompanied him.  You were at 

the age of 14 at time. 
 

...16. 

 

...Pardon. 

 

...16.  We ll, I thought you were younger.  A
nyhow, it doesn't  ma ke really...uh...so...uh...both of 
you and your father was in great distress.  To l
eave a hospital that he is heading just to the 
fate of the people.  And...and very short after 
6 the...the hospital was put on fire with the 
patient s, with the doctors, with admi nisteri
ng personnel and also with the adjacent home  
of orphans of about 400, 300 orphans registered to the 
          .  And the ghetto...the       
was on fire.  The...uh...people...the children were 
taken to the ninth fo
rtress together with 
another thousand of the small ghetto and 
the ghetto, small ghetto, was liquidated.

B:At that time my father made a solemn commitm
ent that the word of contagious diseases did 
not exist in the vocabulary.  And that what le
d in the clandestine treatment of things.  
There were two people, as far as I kn
ow, you and...and ...uh...and Elkes that knew about 
it.  I happened to know about it too, and 
I tell you a little about what happened.  
Uh...The...it's a very interesting thing and my father described it in his me moirs.  For 
some  reason that we don't know ma ny of th
e contagious diseases, like dysentery 
completed disappeared from the ghetto, inspite 
of the terrible sanitary conditions.  My 
father's nightmare at that time was the excr
ement that were used...the winter was very 
cold.  It was the...the coldest winter in th
e history, actually since Napoleon time, and my 
father was always saying, "What will happen in
 the spring when all this excrements will 
start melting?"  But in spite of this, dysentery di sappeared.  Di phtheria.  Di phtheria is a 

disease that is curable provide
d you use serum in the proper ti
me .  As you are aware, we 
didn't have diphtheria serum.  And i f we
 succeeded by clandestine methods...my father 

succeeded or  you succeeded in the...from the 
ghetto, you...Altestenrat to ge t serum, it was 
always given too late.  In spite of that, in a
ll the records that  my fa
ther kept, there was not 
one child that died of diphtheria and other di
seases.  But the really tragedy in the ghetto, 
for my father, was in 1942.  When the German
s were defeated in Moscow, there were a 
lot of Spanish troops who didn't have proper cl
othes.  The blue brigade.  There were 
Germans who didn't have clothes and they we
re amputees sick and by train they were 
sent by the Red Cross train of...Germa n Red 
Cross train, they were sent to...back to 
Germany.  However, the German...being this
 people, full of life because the hy...hygienic 
conditions were worse in the German army of 
that part than it wa
s in the ghetto.  And 
being them full lice and having typhus          
   which is a little different type is from the 
typhus of the            , which is typhus of the           is translated through life.  So in 
Kaunas, they established an               , which me ans they delice. 
 

T:Delousing.

B:Delousing.  So the train would arrive and the 
patient would be taken out from the train, taken 
off, stripped from the clothes, shaven their ha
ir and their clothes were disinfected, and the 
train was disinfected.  Ther
e were two teams wor king.  There was the Jewish team 
working on the dirty side and there was a Lith
uanian team working 
on the clean side.  I 
don't know i f was by providence or whatev
er happened, the Lithuanian side...people 

workers there developed typhus. 
 

T:I don't know.  I know it. 

 

B:No.  We ll, developed a epidemic, and ma ny Lit
huanians died.  As a result, the Lithuanian 
health departme nt i mme diately flooded the 
ghetto, and it is in your book written the dates 
they came and flooded because they justifiabl
e looked for the...for the cause of the...of 
the disease.  But in the... on the Jewish side, 
they were 74 cases of typhus      that my 
father treated them, hid them, and he got
 fr om the Altestenrat extra soap, extra 
consideration in moving the patient to certain
 parts, but he succeeded in...in treating the 
patients.  Now if you take an American textbook,
        , which is a top text book and you 
write...look up the page on typhus           
 , you will find that the morality rate on people 
who are not treated with any me dicine is 60 pl
us percent.  My fath
er in the 74 patient s 
had only 3 deaths, and the only 
three people were people who 
begged him to die.  They 
said they would like...love to di
e in a bed.  They are too tired 
to continue their life.  And 
the Godless in medicine that 
I practiced for 40 years, I lear
ned that when a patient does 
not...when a patient does not have...uh... the will to live, he doesn't live. 
 

T:That's right. 

 

B:This was the job of my  father.  Now I would like
 to me ntion a few recollections of my father's.

T:Too late.  It's  too late. 

 

B:A few recollections... 

 

Q:You're fine.  You have 10 mi nutes. 

 

B:Of my father.  What the reco
llection.  What do I reme mbe r  of
 my father?   I reme mber my 
fa ther teaching me  the morality of life, wh
ich the logic in life morality which I greatly 
appreciate.  I also reme mber of few things of
 my father.  My father practiced me dicine 

for 40 years, like myself, and never sent a bi
ll to a patient.  And I always was wondering 
how he survived.  But he did survive.  And he 
always told me that the last...that the last 
bill he got paid was the heaviest  payment he got.  And the...I have to mention it because 

it's very important.  That was...there was 
a patient in 1938 a woma n was brought to the 
Jewish hospital.  She was very poor.  The 
husband was working as a clean...horse cleaner 

in the Jewish brewer in Lithuanian, which ha
ppened to be a Jewish brewery.  My father 
took care of her in 38.  My mother put packag
es of clothes for her, and I reme mber the 
house calls that my fathe r  used to ma ke and take me  because it was in           and I love d 
to go.  I loved to go for a ride.  In 
1939, as you recall...uh... th
e Germans took away 
the...uh...the port of Clipedell.  The Lithuani
ans got very upset.  They took all the 
Lithuanians of Ger man descent to...uh..and 
send them to...uh...Germa ny.  This ma n knew 
only to clean horses, and in 1944 when my father and I and 
Dr.           , and Dr.              
and...and           got to...lager...Dachau, lage
r 2, this ma n was the chief of command of t he 

SS.  He recognized my father and he extend th
e most unbelievable courtesy.  In fact, he 
risked his life to help us.  One of the thi
ngs he did outside of he
lping us in food and I 
have to me ntion later a few things, bu
t basically he...uh...when 
my...when the first 
patient... person died in lager 2, I 
wrote in the report 'Died of starvation.'  Well, to ma ke a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0316

long story short, this... this report we nt 
to Dachau...to Berlin, to send the Commission, 
and the chief doctor of Dachau who later wa
s hung in the Nuremberg trial was looking 
for my father to kill hi m because he wrote a re
port and a commission came to investigate.  
At that time the German SS were stealing food, 
and they were invest
igating exactly that 
problem.  This SS ma n of my father's friend t
ook my father out, and my father lived for 6 
week in his house til the storm was over. 
 And...uh...I...I...after the 
war, letters were 
written by Dr. Nobliski and Dr. Pepsico to sa
ve this man from the gallow because he 
helped.  The other thing I want
 to tell to tell I was in Israel one day and I went into a 
fa mous bakery kaposki.  And I didn't know
 about it, but I re
cognized...he recognized 
me ...Kaposki, the son.  And he imme diately 
called his father and he kissed me  and 
hugged me  a nd said, "You don't know what your fath
er did for me."  At that time, the son 
was dying.  He had no meat, no protein and needed me at.  My father asked this ma n to 

provide meat.  He didn't...and the German ob
liged him.  He brought me at for Kaposki's 
son to save him.  But I was a muscl e ma n myse
lf and I didn't have meat, and my father did 
not worry about me because I was not in the medical condition...medical physical 

condition that he...so this is the 
character of my father.  That 
one of the dramatic things of 
my father which took me  ma ny years to understand is when my...when the Russian left 

Lithuanian and the Germans advanced to Lithuanian. 
 

T:I cannot wait.  I must go. 

 

B:Please.  Please.  When the ma n waited for...uh...they postponed it.  But let me  finish it please.  
A sentence.  It's  a courtesy.  Okay?   
When the man...uh...when the...the Russia...the 
Lithuanian governme nt....the Russian Lithua
nian governme nt send a car to pick up my 
father and it was 12 steps or 
15 steps from the second floor 
to go down, my father refused 
to...to leave and run to Russia where his life a
nd my whole fa mily's  
he would have saved 
because he fe lt he cannot abandoned his patient 
in the hospital.  Uh...I have ...I cannot...I

feel that my father...his morality, hi s philosophy,
 he lived by it and he taught me the way 
of life.  Sometimes I listened to him.  Sometimes
 I deviated a little from it, but I am very 
grateful to hi s being hi m and teaching 
me the things that I...I taught.   
 
...Thank you.
