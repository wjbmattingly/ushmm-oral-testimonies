United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Frank Liebermann
, conducted by 
Gail Schwartz
, o n  
September 24
th
, 2003 in 
Bethesda, Maryland. 
This interview is part of the 
museum™s project to interview Holocaus
t survivors and witnesses who are also 
volunteers with the mu seum. This is tape numb er one, side
 A. 
Wh at is your full 
name? 
Answer: 
Frank Nathan Liebermann. 
Q: And what was your name at birth? 
A: 
Franz Natan Liebermann
. 
Q: And where and when were you born? 
A: January 19
th
, 1929, in 
Gleiwitz
, on the main street, 
Wi lhelmstrasse Funf. 
Q: Let™s first talk a little bit about your
 family, about your parents. L -- can you 
tell me their names first? 

A: My father was Dr. 
Hans Liebermann, 
an ear, nose, throat specialist who 
practiced medicine in
 Gleiwitz
, and we had an office atta
ched to our apartment on 
the main street. 
Q: And -- and your mother™s name ? 
A: Yeah. My mother was born 
Lo tta Flora Olgala 
in 
Opin
 and married my  fa --

was introduced to my father
 at a -- a fraternity  dan
ce wh en  she was only 16 and 
they were married four years 
later in 1928, February 28. 
Q: How far back can you trace you
r family i-in that part of 
Germany
? 
A: Back to about 
1650. The family 
Olgala 
and 
Bloch
 were in 
Lanendorf
, 
apparently  having emigrated from
 Alsace-Lorraine
 during various pogroms there 
and settled in 
Opin
. In fact, one of -- one of
 our foremothers married 
Michael 
Gratz
, who eventually -- whose -- 
I think granddaughter became 
Rebecca Gratz
 
in 
Philadelphia
. And my  grandfather was very pr
oud. He made a family tree, 
which we have, which showed th
e family and that branch.  
Q: What kind of a neighbo
rhood did you live in, and 
was it a  mixe d neighborhood 
of Jews and non-Jews? 
A: Well, 
Gleiwitz 
was a town of little bit over a hun
dred thousand people, with 
probably about a thousand Je
ws, primarily merchants, pr
ofessional, and of course 
also others. We lived, and as I said my fath
er had his office on the main street with 
a connected apartment. I cons
idered my self very middle cl
ass, in the respect that a 
-- my mother had for the time a n u rsemaid 
for me who stayed almost until we left, 
and was act ive in the comm
unity. They had bil -- were
 quite active before 1935 
also, in the general community
, but that changed drastica
lly with the coming of the 
Nazis, to be limited rea
lly, to Jewish activities.

Q: How religious was your family? 
A: My father came from an Orthodox 
home, my mother came from a barely 

religious home. My grandfather was koshe
r, my  parents did not keep  a kosher 
home, except wh en my grandfather move
d in after my  grandmother died. He 
moved to  
Gleiwitz 
from my father™s birthplace, which was in 
Boyton, 
about 20 
miles away from 
Gleiwitz.
 At th at time we went to -- we had a kosher home and 
my  grandfather, even though he had a separa
te apartment, usually came to us for 
meals, really until we left.  
Q: Did you celebra
te any holidays? 
A: Yes. I mean, we celebrated all holidays.
 I also remember -- rather my father 
was fairly observant in that I n -- I reme
mb er him taking me to
 the service for the 
first born, I think at six o™clock in the 
mo rning, I guess when  I was about seven or 
eight years old. I only have one memo ry of
 doing it, but that 
stays i n  my memory 
bank. 
Q: Any other holiday s that you can talk 
about, that you have memo ries of as a 
young ch ild? 

A: Well, we always -- oh, by th e way, our 
-- oh, we lived about one block from the 
Temple -- rather, the synagogue. I partic
ularly always remembered -- sh -- oh --

Q: Su -- 
A: Where the old age home, which was ri
ght next to th e Temp le, always had a 
Sukko r
 and a had sweets for the kids, and that
 was of particular interest. We al-
also always had, obviously Passover, 
Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur. 
I remember 
the Temple. The women sat in a balcon
y, but it wasn™t closed. There was no 
curtain. It also had music in terms of
 the boy™s choir, co
nducted -- and I still 
reme mb er h i m, b y  
Lira  Fleischer
, who is also the head  of the Jewish school, 
because the public school becam
e closed in 1933, befo re I started, and th e Jewish 
community had four classrooms within th
e school, where the instruction took 
place. The main negative I remember, and 
this was after 1936, was we had to 
leave the school grounds -- or not the sc
hool grounds, but the classrooms during 
lunch period. And we mo re or less had 
to draw a fine line of being in the 
schoolyard, between the boys and the girl
s which were separated, because there 
were fights and so forth and it became mo
re and more danger
ous to be in the

schoolyard. Toward 19
37 - ™38, we were dismissed five
 minutes earlier so that we 
could be aw ay from the grounds by th e time 
school was open, so that we could get 
home safely.  
Q: Let™s talk a little bit about that. How di
d you feel about that? Is it something 
that you would confide in yo
ur parents? Did y
ou have any fears about this kind of 
situation? You were very young, of course , but what can you remember about that 
different treatment that you as a Jewish child got? 
A: I just realized I had to be careful. I 
was given quite a bit of independence. I was 
able to ride my bicycle wherever it 
was in town. In fact , when the public 
swimming pools were closed in 1936, at 
that time I was seven, there was an old 
rock quarry which had water in
 it, kind of a small lake, which became the Jewish 

pool probably about three, four miles out
 of the city. And friends of mine and I 
used to regularly bicycle out there and as
 long as we weren™t in groups, we didn™t 
feel particularly vulnerable. 
Q: What about the teachers in your sc
hool? Wa-a-a -- were any of them Jewish? 
A: They were all Jewish. In other word
s, we had no contact with the regular 
school teachers. I rememb er my  first gir 
-- first -- I went through first, second and 
third grades, and it was strictly -- it was 
a German curriculum, 
but we had our own 
school within the school. 
Upper Silesia
 had been protected 
by a treaty covering

minorities when parts of the area were given to 
Poland, 
and therefore, during the 
transition minorities were protected, th
e German minorities were protected in 
Poland
 and any other minorities we
re also protected in 
Germany
. So that the 
effects of t h e Nazi government 
really starte d in 1936 when 
Der Stürmer
 was at 
every street corner. 
Der Stürmer
 was the anti-Semitic p aper published by 
Goebbels
 and th ey had them behind glass 
for the public to read, virtually 
everywhere. I also recall that in beginnin
g of 1936, my  parent
s insisted that I 
immediately take swimming 
lessons and be able to pass a swimming test of 20 
minutes, because it may be n
ecessary to take an ocean 
voyage. When I was afraid 
of the test at the time, I remember my gr
andfather went with me and said, I™m n o t 
leaving until you do it, because 
the pool is going to be cl
osed very  soon and I want 
you to be a competent swi
mmer. And that was bef -- before the summer of ™36. 
During th e time when the treaty was over, everybody was afraid of riots and there 

were some broken windows 
and similar things. My parents had the foresight to 
take a vacation in 
Bornholm, 
which is an island in the n -- nor -- the 
Baltic Sea
, 
whi -- during these times, a
nd when we returned the at
mo sphere changed pretty 
substantially. In other words, the so-c
alled treaty expired and the community 
caught up with 
the rest of the countr
y in a few weeks.

Q: Were you a very fearful child at this
 time? Were -- how aware were you of the 
growing threat? 
A: I was pretty aware. I was never particularly fearful. I think I have very good 
nerves and that goes back to those days
, I just learned to kind of mind my  own 
business and do whatever I wanted to. I 
had no real limitations except what I 
mentioned for school. In 1937, afte
r my mother had taken a trip to 
Israel
 in -- 
actually, I think late ™35, and determined 
that a doctor had no chan ce of making a 
living in 
Israel
, my parents decided I™d better take
 English lessons and I remember 
I had an English teacher and I did this
 probably about once or twice a week. 
Q: This was a private English teacher that came to the house? 

A: It was not a -- it was not taught in school.  
Q: What language did you speak at home? 

A: German. 
Upper Silesia
 was strictly a German area
. We did not -- people here 
were surprised that we did not speak an
y Yiddish, because Yiddish is really 
medieval German which comb
ined with the local dialects. And since the language 
of our area was German, there was no -- it didn™t stay stagnant and didn™t get 

mixed with any other language
, so that it wasn™t used. 
Q: Did you feel very German?

A: Yes. In other wo rds, the philosophy of 
my parents was that they were Germans, 
but happened to be Jewish
. Like we™re Americans, but
 religiously we™re Jewish. 
Q: Did you feel very Jewish?  
A: Not particularly. In other words, exce
pt that I did go to  a Jewish school and 
after 1936, we couldn™t go to movies or
 other children™s activities, and it -- were 
restricted to certain areas. I reme mb er among the safer playgrounds was an 
organization wh ich was the non-zia -- the 
co-community was pretty mu ch divided 
between Zionists and non-
Zionists. The non-Zionits
-nists being called the 
Schild, 
or Shield Organization. And there was an
 old -- there was a mansion pretty close 
to the middle of town , which served as our playground, and th at was a nice place 
to meet and of course, at that point we 
only played with Jewish kids. My parents 
also shared what was called a 
Schrebergarten, 
which is a piece of land set aside a 
little bit at the ed -- kind of at the edge 
of town, into garden 
plots, where we had 
fruit trees and 
[indecipherable]
. It was shared by about 10
 families. And that was 
a place where we could safely congregateand that was actually a private parcel, 
which was our other playground in summer. In winter the 
Schild
 building was a 
place where we could go insi
de. The Temple really wa
s just for worshipping. 
There was no Sunday 
school, as such. 
Q: So did you get religious tr
aining at the school itself?

A: Wi -- a -- a little bit of Hebrew. Not ve
ry much because I was -- it was too early 
to prepare for 
Bar Mitzvah. 
I was nine years old when I left, and -- 
Q: Wh-W hen you played with your friends
 -- and I -- I realize you™re quite young 
at the time, did you talk about the diffi
cult times with them, or were you just 
children that played regul
ar childhood games?  
A: We did pretty much -- we knew what
 -- what our limitations were, but within 
that -- I don™t think I was, as I said, pa
rticularly either worried, scared in an 
everyday way and we just continued to do
 what was pretty much what we wanted. 
But there were limitations of th ings. We knew what not to do. 
Q: You had mentioned that 
you learned how to swim. We
re there any other sports 
that you got involved in  as a young child? 

A: Oh, ev erybody played kind of sandl
ot soccer. That was probably th e main 
game. That was about the only one because 
anything that would be mo re formal 

was really prohibited because 
you couldn't  go to parks, 
you couldn™t go to places 
where that existed.  

Q: So you did not ha
ve any contact with non-Jewish peers? 
A: Very, very little. 
Q: What about the non-Jewi
sh neighbors of yours? 
A: Just no contact. We minded 
our business and that was it.

Q: Were any of them pleasant to you? 
A: I don™t really remember any contac
t with neighbors because living in an 
apartment building, we were in the first 
floor. Therefore -- the f -- no, wait a mo -- 
fir -- it was actually the second floor. Ther
e were stores on the bottom. The first 

floor is what the Europeans call the f -- 
one flight up. And I didn™t pass anybody 
except wh en  I went out. So we had th
e whole floor. Ou r apartment had four 
bedrooms plus an office, so that I™d 
have people over, we stopped using the 
playground area in the apartm
ent, because was considered
 a good idea. But there 
were enough things to
 do th at I didn™t consid
er myself d eprived.  
Q: Did you have a lot of toys a
nd games, and did you read books? 
A: Yes, yes. I had -- I felt I had just 
about ev erything th at -- I wasn™t missing 
anything. 
Q: What were your favorite games to play? 

A: Probably  trains. I had my  -- I had mode
l trains from as long as I can remember, 
and in fact, when we were ready to leave 
Germany
, my  grandfather gave me two 
presents. One was an 
HO 
gauge, which was new at that
 time. That was the small 
gauge mo del train, which could be set up 
on a table, that in case we were in a 
small apartment, it would fit on our dining
 room table. The other thing I got was a 
golden watch for my  
Bar Mitzvah
 when  I would have it, wherever we were.

Q: Did you have any or -- or -- brothers or sisters? 
A: No, no. My mo ther had a couple of
 miscarriages and I was an only child. 

Q: Le -- I -- again, I realize you were ve
ry young at the time. Were you -- do you 
have any memo ries, being a four year old, 
of the boycott, or any stories about the a 
-- the April 1
st
, 1933 boycott. Family stories. 
A: We were not affected by that. In other words, due to the treaty, what the 

boycott was in the rest of 
Germany
, 1936 was in -- 
was when it hit 
Upper Silesia
. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: As far as memories is concerned, the only thing I -- I do remember my father™s 

parents had a small hardware store, agai
n on the main square, and I remember 
their house, which was above the store and 
I realize they did no
t have -- they only 
had one area in the kitchen with runni
ng water, and for washing th ey still took a 
basin with a jug for the hot water. So this
 must have been  around 1934, because 
my  grandmother died  of a stroke in 1935, after which my  grandfather closed up 
the store and moved to 
Gleiwitz
 to be near my parents. 
Q: So at the time, let™s say, of the 
Nuremburg 
rally in 1935, your parents didn™t 
talk about th
is with you. 
A: It was -- it didn™t affect us, therefore a 
lot of -- a-also, my father didn™t lose his 
hospital privileges until 1936. 
Many other physicians left

1933 and 1934, because afte
r the boycott, they saw th
e handwriting on th e wall. It 
didn™t show up til much later in 
Silesia
, so that it also had the fact that fewer 
people really saw the urgency of leaving.  
Q: So when were the first restrictions
, besides the school, that you rememb er? 
A: Mainly that we couldn't go into certai
n stores and that we mo re or less were 
given maps of what we could and what 
we couldn™t do. But it didn™t stop our 
movement, but rather, there are just ce
rtain things wh ich 
one doesn ™t do.  
Q: Did -- 
A: And we took it in that sense, that 
same as parents said you don™t -- you don™t 

cross the main street. 
Q: Did you ever question any 
of this to your parents? 
A: Just that as si -- that it 
wasn 't safe and that there ar
e en-enough things for me to 
do without it. 
Q: When  did you see your first swastika? 
A: Probably quite early, because it was on every stamp, it was on every 
government -- government building, but it 
was taken as something th at -- that 
existed, but didn™t have 
the same conno
tations -- 
Q: Same connotations of wh at? 

A: -- that we see now, of -- that it was a 
serio u s threat. And, in fact, most people

felt it would blow over and wouldn™t last, pa
rticularly my mother™s parents, who 
had celebrated the hundredth anniversary 
of a wholesale leather business with a 
tannery in 1933, and surviv
ed in very good
 shape through the hunger of World 
War I, when they could always barter leat
her for food at the 
local -- from the local 
farmers. And felt they were pretty mu
ch immune from anything that would 
happen. They really didn™t appreciate
 what ha -- what was going on until 
Kristallnacht.

Q: This is a continuation of the

Frank Liebermann
. This is tape number one, 
side
 B. 
When did you first he
ar about a man called 
Adolf Hitler
? 
A: Probably  around 1935, because one did 
listen to speeches and the fact that h e 
was able to arouse almost riotous reactions
, and people started talking about what 
was going to happen next. Again, wa -- how political 
is a five year old, and I 
couldn™t really absorb what was going on
 in the same way as my parents, who 
obviously were quite concer
ned, as I sa id, whether it™s a  ocean voyage, learning 
English and so forth. That became pretty 
clear even before the end of the treaty,

and I™d say around 1935. By  the time I st
arted school, which was in 1935, it was 
already fully segregated and I just 
thought that™s the way it had to be. 
Q: Now, 1935 is wh en you 
said your mother went to 
Palestine. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Were your parents already Zionists? 

A: No. No, it™s -- they were 
always su -- very supportive
 of Zionism, mainly as a 
refuge, and especially after the conclusi
on that a doctor couldn't ma ke a living, 
they eliminated the th
ought of moving to 
Palestine
 as o n e of the possibilities, 
pretty early.  

Q: As things moved on, what about food
? Were your -- were you able to get 
enough fo od? No  -- any problems with that? 

A: No, there were no problems with food 
except there were certain regulations, 

that on certain days -- I believe it was 
Friday or Thursd ays, you had to do 
everything in one part in order to conser
ve fuel and I really don™t know if these 
were restricted -- restrictive laws for th
e Jewish community, or
 for everybody. Oh, 
one other comment, which I think it inte
rest i ng. The synagogue covered all 
degrees of religious activities, fro m what 
we would say very 
Orthodox to quite 
Reform. And th ere was only one synagogue.
 However, virtually all of the families 
bought from the kosher butcher, because 
he couldn™t make 
a living on only the

15
people wh o were kosher. Conseque
ntly, we ate kosher food as a 
mitzvah
 for the 
rest of the community. 
Q: Did you observe 
Sha bba t
 every week? 
A: We drove and I had my  -- I once got caught with my  scooter, and -- by my  

Sunday school teacher, who objected, but I 
wasn™t punished for it. And it™s really a 

question of what is work  in 
Biblical times, co mpared to 
what is work  today, so I 
have no strong feelings on the subject.  
Q: Did you have a family Friday night dinner? 
A: Yes, in fact for many years while my  grandparents were still in 
Boyton
, we 
always went there for Friday night. My fa
ther had bought a car in 1933, wh ich was 
a major luxury at that time, wa
s a convertible. Something like a 
VW 
convertible, 
except smaller. And ev ery Frid ay night we would go to 
Boyton, 
which is -- as I 
said, it™s about 20 miles away, and be at 
my  grandmother™s for dinner. And one of 
the foods wh ich I happened 
to have liked, which my  ki
ds could never understand, 
was a liver soup. But she 
made a very good one.  
Q: Were -- did you have any childhood so
ngs that you rememb er, that -- were you 
musical? Was that something 
that gave you comfort? 
A: I would say mo st of the ones we had 
we learned from the 
maids, which were

mo  -- almo st semi-Nazi songs. Bu  -- rather
 war -- not Nazi, generally, but warlike, 
about a comrade and things like this and 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Ca -- can you sing any?  
A: Huh? 
Q: Can you sing any of it? 

A: Yes. I had a comrade -- I mean, I™m tr
anslating it -- we marched together in 

step. Then a bullet came flying, I didn™t k
now if it -- w ould it be meant for me or 
for him? It was meant for him. He was tr
 -- h e was shot down, he™s lying on my 
feet. I mean these ca -- and all kinds of 
militaristic th-things about the German 
forests and tha -- the songs 
were very nationalistic. Like
 -- almost like the army 
songs that we learned here from the aca
demies. Over hill, over dale, at -- and 

etcetera. 

Q: How did your parents feel 
about you learning those songs? 
A: I don™t know wh at they knew or did an
ything else, but that was -- that™s also 
what you heard on the radio. So that was 
almost pop culture. And I still rememb er 
quite a few of them. 

Q: Can you sing one or two lines from some of them? 
A: Like over hill, over dale, what was it? Just a second.

world. Kind of suggesting the world is our
 oyster. And th e re -- what you heard on 
the radio was mo re and mo re that as it progr
essed. But I di -- again, as a six year 
old, I didn™t understand the 
significance, except that 
I still rememb er some of 
them. 
Q: All right, let™s follow through now. Wh
en did you realize you were leaving, or 
what did your parents first seriously begin to do? 

A: First of all, my  grandfather was a ge
nealogist and wh en he -- when my  father 
were thinking of the 
United Sta tes
, he looked up relatives. There were a couple of 
other relatives who had left and he gave em 
-- as I said before, he traced the family 
back to pretty early 
times. During my father™s
 trip finally to the 
United States
 to 
try to find affidavits for the family  a
nd the affidavit being to guarantee that 
whoever comes over will not be on welfare,
 and would be
 supported for a year, he 
fou -- he sent my father to 
Philadelphia
 to check the 
grates
 records. 
Unfortunately -- 
Q: What year was this? 
A: This was January, 1938. Af
ter correspondence, he took th
e trip an -- as a visitor 
and it happens that 
Rebecca™s 
brother married a non-Jewish wo man and emigrated 
-- rather, and went west to 
Louisville
. There™s some corre
spondence with the 
brother, but only for the first generation, 
and then the family 
records were lost.

never had any children, so that the fami ly tree kind of 
stopped there. 
Q: Your -- your father did 
not have difficulty getting passa
ge and a -- and a visa to 
visit the 
United States
 in 1938? 
A: He could pay for it with German mark
s. The big problem was that you co uld 
only spend German money, you couldn™t 
take anything out. And visitor™s visas 
were granted. That isn™t the 
same -- like you can go to 
Switzerland
, but God 
forbid you should liv
e there. At that point there was also a brother-in-law of my  
grandfather™s father. No, wait a mi nute, it was a brother-in-law -- in-law of my  

grandfather. Borrowed a substantial amount
 of money for a week and disappeared 
to the 
United States
 in 1935, almo st causing -- causing a major business crisis, but 
they averted bankruptcy. He found out that he was in 
New York
 and had a very  
good job. In fact, he was vice president of
 Bendix 
av iation in  1938. And my  father 
got a vi -- an affidavit from him, on wh ich we came over that July. 
Q: What was his relative™s name? 
A: 
Charlie Marcus. 
Q: Was he willing to give your father
 the affidavit without any problem? 
A: He gave my -- my father got the affi
davit and immediately left. I mean, he got 
the affidavit in January. It took awhile 
for it to come through. We got a number

and in fact I don™t know if it™s in the 
other reco rds. No thing was happening and 
everybody was getting kind of anxious. So 
a friend of theirs said look, what you 
have to do is to get a box of candy for 
Fräulein Schmidt, 
who™s the secretary of 
the consul in 
Berlin
. My father dutifully went to 
Berlin
, got a box of candy and 
about four weeks later nothing happened. 
And he called his friend again and wh at 
can I do? And he said, well, 
what did you put into the 
box of candy? And he said 
nothing. I said, that was your first mistak
e. You have to  put in a hu-hundred mark 
bill, and then you™ll get action. 
Q: Now, this is from the American consulate? 

A: American consul. That was minor corru
ption comp ared to some of the smaller 
countries, who took huge payouts and then
 very often issued fraudulent visas as 
happened with the 
Saint Louis
 in 
Cuba . 
Virtually all the smaller countries made 
major businesses of giving visas with brib
es. Some were legitimate and some were 
not. 
Q: Now, were you aware at the time that 
your parents were making this effort to 
leave? 
A: Oh, definitely. I was awar
e that when I had to lear
n how to swim, that we™ll 
probably  take an ocean voyage.

Q: And how did you feel that -- where you
 said you felt German, what were your 
thoughts before you left, about leaving 
Germany
? 
A: If that™s -- if that™s what we ha

Q: But you would be -- 

A:

at th at age, the roots are with 
the parents, not with  the community. You

the thoughts of a teenager -- 
Q: Say you -- 
A: -- who doesn™t want to lose his frie

playmates. I had no -- I had no hesitation. 
Q: What did you know about 
America
 at that time? 
A: Just that it was a fabulous co untry. 
Q: How did you know it? 

A: That™s what my parents told me. I 
really  knew very little, but that they had 
friends there and they  -- who™ve gone befo
re, and that they™re sure I™d like it.  
Q: Did you have a large extended family in 
Germany
 and therefore you™d be 
leaving them? 
A: Primarily my mother -- my fa

Austria

emigrated to 
Austria
. My mother™s family was pa

some in 
Breslau
 and some in 
Berlin.
 The ones in 
Berlin
 were making plans to 
leave and another aunt was staying, and finally got to 
England
 around 1940. 
That™s about it -- that was ab
out it of the content. The ca -- those were the majo r 
contacts that we had.  
Q: So your father comes ba
ck and then applie s for the visa with the candy and the 

-- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- and the money and then wh at happened ? 
A: It finally came throu
gh, we had to go to 
Berlin
 for a physical in June, 1938 and 
then we -- my father went 
on the next ship and left
 my mother to close the 
household, because the visa was good 
for 120 days, so it was good through 
October. And we therefore booked  in Octobe
r, in order to pack what had -- d-deci 
-- my  mo ther had to decide what belongings
 to take along. At that time we could 
still pack what was called the lift, which is
 a container which, providing a tax was 
paid for th e hundred percent value of wh at
ever you™re taking out. So  that we did 
take most of our furniture that was p
ack-able, most of my father™s office 
equipment. We also -- he also bought the 
latest equipment that -- for state of the 
art an d  I als o  rememb e r  my  mo th
er bought the laser -- latest 
Singer
 sewing 
machine, so that in case she had to se

quite good at being -- that was a way of 
even tu ally making money and su rviv ing, 
because of course one couldn't tak e any 
money out, except the small amounts that 
they were ab le to smuggle out by going to  
Czechoslovakia
 regularly and sending 
it forward. But that was necessary  but 
quite dangerous and th at was for bare 
subsistence. Also, we went first class on 
the ship because you could pay for it in 
German money and first cl
ass pa -- allowed -- allowed you amount of spending 
money per person. So that 
spending money was our subsis
tence, because we used 
it and convert it in the -- in -- into
 dollars when we arrived here. 
Q: Why did your father 
go before you? Why didn™t
 you th ree go to gether? 
A: Because he had to ta -- he had to st
udy for the state b o ards, and he rented a 
room for five dollars a week and signed up
 for the state b o ards in December, so 

that -- and had to be a resident of 
Ohio
 in order to be eligible. If we w -- he would 
have arrived in October, he would have lost
 six month. As it was, he signed up in 

January on -- while a visitor and then took
 it in December. So for all appearances 
he was a resident for almost a ye
ar, and he passed his state board. 
Ohio
 passed 50 
percent of those people taking it, a
nd he passed it on the first try. And --

A: In English. He had taken Fren ch an

course medical terminology has quite a 
bit of Latin roots, which made that 
somewhat easier. 
Q: So you and your mo
ther were left in 
Germany
 to get ready to leave. 
A: That™s correct. In other 
words, my mother basically 
sold the car, so
ld whatever 
she could, had ev erything packed  and in f
act, we had an  incident during that time, 
that on the way -- that a -- while playing at the 
Schild 
area, I -- we were playing 
tag and I broke my  arm. And when my  mo
ther called the hospital, a colleague of 
my father, with whom they had -- not so
cialized, but with whom they  had had 
dinner at various times in the early 30™
s, said I™m sorry, I don™t treat Jewish 
children, I can™t help you. And she starte
d making calls to have it set and found a 
doctor in my father™s hometown of 
Boyton
, who agreed to meet us at the back 
door of a Catholic orphanag e in 
Boyton
. My mother took a taxi there, he set it and 
put it in a cast, and I -- this must have 
been in July and I -- 
by the time we left I 
was out of the cast and it had pretty well healed. 
Q: We-Were there no Jewish doctors who would set it?  

A: Not in gli -- in

was a pretty small co mmunity. So --

Q: And then , o-on your way out of the 
country, how did you -- wh at was your 
journey from 
Gleiwitz
? 
A: From
 Gleiwitz, 
first we went to 
Opin
 to say goodbye to my
 grandparents, who, 
by the way were quite -- I w
on™t say angry, but were not happy with my  father 
taking th eir only daughter to this strange country wh ere we may not see them 
again. My  mo ther™s brother -- one a -- one of the brothers, went with us. And I 

reme mb er we had to  stop in 
Berlin 
to get our passport stamped with a 
J
. I think I 
gave that passport to the Holocaust Muse
um. We had to  stand in line about four 
hours in the police station in  
Berlin
 before going on to  -- to 
Bremerhaven
 from 
where we left. 
Q: Did your parents have those middl
e names that were assigned to Jews, 
Sarah 
and 
Israel
 on th eir papers? 
A: That -- no, that -- that was after -- I believe that was after Crystal Night. Oh, 
one other incident. During th
e month of September, we got cable after cable from 
my father to go on 
an earlier ship. We re
ally didn™t know why, because there was 
almost complete censorship 
on what was going on at 
Munich
, and that 
Hitler
 had 
called back the 
Europa
, on which we were 
scheduled to sail from 
C h erbourg,
 as 
a wharf rat. And when we finally arri -- 
ar -- my mother coul
dn™t get an earlier 
sailing because it was -- it wa -- it was booke

ship in order to take money out and to be
 ab le to pay in  German money. When  we 
arrived in 
Bremen
 there was no ship. It was then th
at we found out that it was -- it 
lost, originally, two days, of which it had 
made up one, due to being called back. 
And the next day it arrived an
d we left one day late. And that was the first time I 
saw my uncles cry, because he took us to
 the ship. That was 
my mother™s brother, 
Walter. 
We had a pretty rough sailing, it wa
s hurricane season and I was pretty 
much alone on the sh ip, most times, watc
hing the bow go under the wav -- go into 
the waves. But my  mother I think, had pa
rtly a breakdown from all the strain and 
partly was seasick. We had a couple of ot
her rather scary incidents. In the packing 
-- quote unquote friends said they wanted 
to  help by packing my  bicycle in a box 
and preparing it to use the least possible sp
ace. And they deliver
ed the bicycle to 
us and it was packed, and -- 
with all the other things. 
And th ey had -- when we 
packed  our bags, they  had a 
customs inspector check all of
 the luggage to see that 
nothing illegal went in and 
put a seal on it. When we 
arrived on the ship, all the 
seals were broken open by 
the Gestapo, to check on th
e customs officials, because 
the customs official said yes, I™m going 
out for lunch now, d
on™t touch anything. 
And -- but my  mo ther didn™t take any ch ances and left things 
copacetta.  
Q: Wha-What was it like for you to
 see people in Gestapo uniforms?

A: By that time they were pretty scary 
and you just kept out
 of their way. My  
father had quite an incident with an  ar
med Gestapo coming in to his office. As a 
result of the -- there™s a tra 
-- the way that you have a lo
ng term lease in -- or had a 
long term lease in 
Germany
, you gave a mo rtgage to th
e landlord, so it™s basically 
you lent him money. And for that it was 
a long term lease. When we decided to  
leave, he -- the landlord had to pay back  
the mo rtgage. And that was tra -- ordered 
transferred to my father™s bank acco
unt from the landlord™s bank account. 
Somebody at the landlord™s bank called the 
Gestapo that a large sum of mo ney is 
being transferred to Dr.
 Liebermann
, and consequently the 
two agents came in  -- 
into the office while somebody 
was there and said we™re here to arrest you. And he 
said, for what cause? You withdrew a larg
e amount of money. I said, excuse me, 
this was transferred to my account at 
such and such bank, 
which is frozen. I 
suggest you call the bank. It™s daytime. 
And fortunately the president of the bank 
who knew him answered and 
said that they money is on deposit, and th ey left.

 A,

. 
Q: Did it have any meaning to you wh en
 you got off th e boat and stepped on 
American soil? 
A: Well, it looked gigantic. I 
had come from a small city, and 
New York
 is an 
overw helming sight. On e of the Americans on the ship sh owed me the Statue of

it -- th -- most of the time there were 
maybe -- between 10 and 20 peop
le in the ma -- in the dini

the first class section wasn™t that big, bu
t we had a lot of room to walk around on 
the promenade deck. So I spen
t mo st of the time just being in terest -- of course, I

other words, I was about the only one who 
wasn™t sitting on it. But I accepted that. 
Q: So th en you -- you come to 
New York
 and your -- was your father at the dock? 
A: My father was at th e dock. He splurged -- we had a room at the 
Hotel Taft 
for 
three days, and then  took th e 
New York Central
 to 
Cleveland
. 
Q: What was the reunion like between you
r mo ther and your father and you? 
A: Oh great, great. And in th -- 
Cleveland
 he rented one room -- one bedroom 
apartment near 
Cain  Park
 where I slept in the 
Murp hy 
bed. That was my  
introduction to the 
United States
. And on the first Thursday we had a feast. We 
bought -- there was a deli downstairs and he
 bought a corned be
ef sandwich and a 
loaf of bread. And th at was the first 
notaful
 American meal -- th-th -- the 
American meal that I got. 
We had one other funny in
cident, we had a German

English and terrible German, saying in  ot
her word s something

the faucet and th -- who answered

. In other words, I™ll fix 
it for you, in other word s sil -- and I reme
mb er my  mo ther saying gee, I hope we™ll 
be able to learn at least one lang -- to 
speak one language well. They -- my  parents 
went out the first time, I remember -- I be
lieve it was a S aturday
, they went out to 
a movie, and I believe it was -- it was a night of 
Kristallnacht
, or rather the -- at 
three o™clock in the mo rning on -- and 
they  had left somebody in the next 
apartment to look after -- t-to look in
 on me. And I know -- and I remember 
getting a call, a desperate call from my  grandpa
rents to talk to my  mo ther, that the 
two brothers had been  arrested and I th
ink everything was -- and I just took 
messages, who theoperator 
was, and when they came ba
ck, the world changed. So 
that was -- I said -- they 
got through to them and from that time on there was a -- 
first of a -- the primary objective was still,
 the state boards were in December. And 
right after the state boards, after he got 
notice that he passed, which was, I think 
the end of December, he 
had arranged 
to go to 
Philadelphia
. Somebody had been 
recommended, a professor at 
Hanneman.
 He wanted to learn American meth -- 
methods. That was a fraternity brother. He
 said, why don™t you go there, and he 
did that -- he wa -- he was at the pe -- their house, and he was particularly nice. 
And as he was leaving, he said, by th
e way, you mentioned that this Dr.
 
Seiderman
 recommen d ed me and I really don™t 
know, who is he? So it turned out 

 
 
Interv iew with F r

31
that this colleague of his,
 a fraternity brother, basically wanted to get him out of 
Cleveland
 because he shared
 an office with an ear, nos
e, throat surgeon. So he 
made the suggestion that 
Dayton
 would be a good spot. 
And even  though it wasn™t 
well meant, it turned 
out to be a very, ve
ry good recommendation, because it was -
- there was no -- the reason he went there 
was that there was no Jewish ear, nose, 
throat doctor in
 Day t on
, but 
[indecipherable]
 he built up a very successful 
practice, partly with the help of the me
dical society in vetoing his admission by 
passing an 
expos facto 
law on a Friday night, someti
me i -- after he made the 
application requiring citizen
ship. Somebody leak
ed that to the newspaper and th e 
Dayton Herald
, to which he was eternally grateful, had a Sunday editorial on 
freedom of opportunity in the 
United States
. And the following Monday he had 
11 new patients. So that was -- what do th
ey generally say -- so
 anyway, the next 
Monday he had 11 new patients 
and that really establishe
d his practice. And oddly 
enough, his main practice was not Jewish. In
 other words, he was fair -- a fairly 
brusque individual and -- who said what he
 wanted and didn™t have the be-bed side 
manners for Jewish pa -- that some Jewish
 patients preferred. By the way, another 
side. After the war, he was the recipient of the 75
th
 anniversary award for 
international 
HIAS
, for his resettlement effo rts. He gave over a hundred affidavits

personally, to sponsor people after World 
War II. He received th
at together with 
President 
Truma n
, and I think three others. 
Q: This is the Hebrew immigrant aid society award. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Let -- let™s go back a little
 bit to when your parents heard the news about 
Kristallnacht
. Did they take any actions? After that you said they called the 
family. 
A: Well, when he went to 
Philadelphia,
 before going to 
Philadelphia -- 
oh, first 
of all, they fi -- they all wa
nted to leave at that point. In
 other words, they realized 
that it was much more serious
 than they had believed at first. And he -- they made 
every effort to try to 
get help. On the way to 
Philadelphia
 he stopped to see
 
Charlie Marcus. 
And by the way, we had bought hi
m a large crystal ass -- ashtray 
as a matter of thanks wh en we arrived. Bu
t on his second visit he said he can™t take 
any more responsibility and it was my pare
nt™s belief that this was a little bit too 
close. In other words, my father was 
once removed. My grandfather -- now it™s -- 
they had -- he may want repayment for th
e debt, and he said he can™t take any 
more responsibility. This was, by the way, a 
man who filed, with the affidavit, his 
income tax return of 1938 of 
38,000 dollars. So I just sa
y that for perspective. You 
know wh at 38,000 dollars was in 1938. They did --

A: They did manage to get som -- my  fath
er™s father, who had signed him into an 
old age home in -- or what woul
d be called assisted living in  
Breslau
, figuring that 
he didn't want to be a burden. He was ab
le to get an exit visa for him and he got 
sick on the way to th e ship, and 
was taken directly to te -- 
Theresienstadt
 and 
never got out. My mother™s brothers were fin ally booked in 1940
 on an Italian ship 
to 
Shanghai
, which left, I think on the day of the breakthrough of the 
Maginot
 
Line
, wh ich caused 
Italy 
to declare war on 
Brita in 
and 
France
, and the ship had 
to turn back b
ecause it didn™t get through the 
Suez
 
Canal
. And th at was the 
brother that took us to th e ship an d my  
mother™s other -- his twin, and his wife and 
four year old daughter. My mo ther also
 had a younger brot
her, who was 11 years 
younger, who was running constantly to 
Berlin
 to try to get every embassy for 
visas. And at the age of something like 
19, unfortunately was not successful. We 
never knew whether it was a question of ag
e or just that they were hitting their 
heads against a wall. B u t the next thing 
we heard that they were t-taken to 
Theresienstadt
, I believe in 1941. And 
they had been married by 
Leo
 
Ba eck
, who 
was a ra -- the rabbi in 
Opin
 before he moved to
 Berlin

contacted him when he visited 
Cincinnati. 
And he confirmed that they had been  
sent to 
Auschwitz
 in 1944.

 apparent and nobody did anything. 
Q: So even after the 
anschluss
 in spring of ™38, your -- your extended family did 
not make an effort to leave, it was only after
 Kristallnacht? 
A: It was really only after 
Kristallnacht. 
In fact, my grandfather offered my father 
that if he moved to
 Breslau
, there was enough of a Je
wish community that he 
could continue to practice me

 couldn™t make a living, he could open  a 
leather business and get credit. And he just
 felt that he would be able to survive

A: Look, every time we were -- every tim
e the mailman came, you looked if there 
was any news. Because once they were in 
Theresienstadt
, there was no free mail, 
it could only go thro ugh the Red Cross, 
and as the war progressed, it beca -- it 
came -- it b ecame more and mo
re convincing that things 
looked bleak. They were 
very active -- my f -- d u ring that time and fo
r the rest of his life he was head of the 
professional 
UJA
. They also went to 
France
 under the -- on an inquiry, for 
example, when the 
Algeria
 -- during th e Algerian 
times, when the Jewish 
community was in severe trouble, for the 
UJA
, finding out that the French were of 
very little help, and they went -- as I sa

Israel
 
regularly. In other words, th

office on 
Valentine™s Day. 
Q: This is 1939? 
A: 1939. And -- 
Q: What was it like to ope
n the box and see your bike? 
A: That was quite an experience, because 
shortly after we arrived, we got a letter 
from the bicycle dealer saying 
that they should 
be very careful in unpacking the 
bicycle and they should look inside the fra
me, that there are so
me very valuable 
gold pieces inside the frame and they sh
ould keep it for th
em. My father was 
furious, because that was 
a capital offense and my moth
er and I could have been 
sent to a concentration camp for it. And he kept those gold  pieces. After the war 

they wanted a refrigerator from the 
United States
, which he sent them pre-paid 
and my  kids and my  wife and I each have
 the gold pieces, which are of a Kaiser 
who only  served 90 days, and th erefore 
very few were minted. And th-that™s one 
of the family heirlooms. But it came at 
a very, potentially high price. And those 
are the people -- those pe
ople then escaped to 
Israel
. 
Q: So you™ve moved to 
Dayton

think a Dr. 
Hallas, 
who is Chief of Staff of 
Good Samaritan Hospital
 came to  
see him and offered him privileges due to
 the circumstances. And he basically 
served in 
Dayton
. He volunteered for the army, but 
was rejected at that point -- 
this was in 1941, because 
Dayton
 became a very critical industrial area with a 
shortage of docto rs. They had 
a major influx of workers from 
Kentucky 
and 
Tennessee
 for various war plant -- 
Dayton 
was both a 
Chry sler
 and 
Genera l 
Moto rs 
town. And we went through the war in -- in 
Dayton
, and as I said, he 
became very active -- he became the co
nduit for all immigrants coming in, 
because he had his connections
 in the Jewish community 
as well as being able to 
relate to the immigrants. And he was head
 of the Jewish Family Service, which 
was a volun -- as a volunteer, and my  
mother™s chief endeavors were in 
Hadassah 
and ch ild welfare. Pra -- I would say ag
ain, thinking -- she thought of adopting a 
war orphan, but then  decided that she 
probably  was not in a men -- mental 
condition to really do it well, and wa
s in char -- was 
mainly active in 
Hadassah 
child welfare. 
Q: Uh-huh. Let™s talk a little bit abou

did you feel -- I assume you 
started school right away -- 
did you feel different than 
the other young students?

A: I started  in 
Cleveland
 being put back to -- a year. I started a -- I was put back 
in the third grade, as wh
en I was 10 years old. But as soon as we moved to
 
Dayton
, I was moved up a year and th en ag ain I skipped the fifth grade, so that I 
was -- got back to myse -- to my level pr
etty quickly . I didn™t have any problem 
with friends, both Jewish and non-Jewish. 
I had an interesting experience in our 
Temp le, since you asked 
about being religio us. In
 Dayton
 the only te
m -- the only 
synagogue which had Sunday schools, had a Sunday school and a fu ll time 
English speaking rabbi -- was a R eform 
Temple, which at that time was ultra-
Reform. And I remember the first time we went -- I went to Sunday school, we 

had an assembly which was -- they ran ou
t of money during the Depression so that 
the assembly hall was made into the Te
mple, a dual purpose with a -- with an 
everlasting light. And I did 
-- having been used to ha
ving something on my  head, 
when I went into the Temple
, I kept my baseball cap on and I remember -- I fo rget 
his first now m -- his name -- name was 
Shapiro
 and he became a rabbi, said to 
me, 
Franz
, it™s impolite to wear a hat inside th
 -- rather, inside the Temple. So -- 
but he became very -- my father beca
me very active in the Temple and was 
probably  pushing toward th
e more traditional side, because it was pretty much 
realized that it had gone too far. I was never 
Bar Mitzvahed
, because the Temp le 
didn™t have 
Bar Mitzvahs 
in those days. Confirmation were thought to be a mo re

appropriate age, especially since most ki
ds stopped going to  Su nday school after 
Bar Mitzvah.
 And this was a way of continuing 
the education through at least the 
11
th
 grade, or the end of the 10
th
 grade. 
Q: Did you talk about your life in 
Germany
 with your American friends? 
A: In the beginning I was asked to talk a 
little bit, but my parents really -- I think 
after one or two, tried to reduce that b
ecause item number one, they  didn't  want to 
get into any subjects which were controve
rsial. Which was part of how we had 
been brought up. And any r
eal f -- thoughts were only 
self-centered on what one 
should say and shouldn™t say.

that we had before out of the picture. I -- we -- I learned to play 
one o™ cat
, which 
was the su -- the game in -- in those days 
of playing baseball with half a team. We 
didn™t have Little Leagues, or anything 
like that. I had to learn what football was 
because nobody here pl
ayed soccer. And I 
became a -- an avid 
Cincinnati Reds
 
fan. And I really didn™t -- I didn™t even know that I had an accent til I got to 
college, because was j u st igno

Q: Were you still
 Franz

A: Yes. I didn™t really change my
 name until I got into business. 
Q: What was December 7
th

A: We were -- we had gone out that morn
ing and I rememb er after lunch, I think 
my  parents took a nap or went in  the be
droom, tur -- we turned
 on the radio, and 
all 
[tape break] 
again, we had a -- we had a radio in th e bedroom, and I guess it 

mu st have been about two o™clock that 
we heard the announcement, it was a state 
of disbelief. And of course 
I still vividly remember the 
speech of a day that wi-will 
live in infamy. And that of course almo
st totally preven ted any further contact 
with the family, because the only 
mail that co uld go out was through 
Spa in
, or th -
- through 
Portugal
, up to that tor -- while 
Germany
 was ada -- rather, before 
December seventh. After that, all communi
cation except the Red Cross, stopped.

So those -- that started a period of no 
co mmunications that I really don™t know 
how my mother survived it.
 But I guess both parents were pretty strong people. 
Q: What was her state of mind? You said
 she was wearing black at that time. 
A: And she was just keeping 
busy. That™s why I say, with volunteer organizations, 

she decided to help in the office and it wa s pretty close to wher
e we lived, so that 
when  I came home -- she always had lunch for me and came home after school. 

And we really adapted ve
ry quickly to life in 
Dayton
. In 1941 -- first of all in 
1940 I felt very privileged, we got a car, 
which was up to that point my father 
could -- did -- commu ted to the hospital 
by bus, because again, every dollar was 
extremely precious. I reme mb er getting th e car, getting the first glimpse of the 
country, and we took our first vacation in the 
Smokies
 that August. I was a boy 
scout and did all the basic activities that 
one is supposed to do and I felt very 
comfortable, and had no problems 
getting used to the community.  
Q: Did an ybody mistake you fo r just bein
g German and not being a German Jew, 

and did you experience
 any discrimination? 
A: The one thing wh ich we were laughi
ng about is that I went to camp, I 
developed hay fever, and when
 I -- I went to camp when I was 11 and I was able 
to take my folding camera. When I was 
12, I became an enem
y alien and we had 
to register as enemy aliens. And technica

country -- get out of the -- 
Montgomery  
county, which was 
Dayton, Ohio™s
 
county, without permission 
from the authorities. And ba
sically we were laughing 
about it. In other words, I as an 11 year 
old was free to travel, 
my  parents weren™t. 
But -- 
Q: Oh see -- you were not considered an enemy alien? 

A: Not until I turned 12. 

Q: Oh, oh, oh.  
A: That was in 1940 -- 1942 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did th at make you angry? 
A: We were laughing about it, because 
there was no place to go an yway. There 
were travel restrictions, gasoline rationi
ng. So what™s the di
fference? But these 
other -- you -- you have to -- you have 
to laugh at anything th at™s funny. 
Otherwise, of course everybody -- we went  through all the things which were done 

during World War II. We were encouraged to
 ge -- to get jo -- when we were in 
high school we were encouraged  to get 
jobs to replace people. I worked in a 
clothing store for 35 cents an hour. But 
it -- there were such shortages and they 
didn't  -- I mean, my 
mother packed a lunch which 
was probably  worth about two 
hours -- two or three hours wo rk. 
But it gave everybody a sense of 
accomplishment, and my father regularly vo

physicals, I think

 and every -- everybody pitched in and 
World War II was unique that it was -- got

moral war that everybody su pported. 
Q: Did you follow the -- 
A: The news? 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: The news of the war, and how did you do that? 

A: Radio. In other words, I remember 
Lowell Thomas, H.V. Kaltenborn

Edwa rd R. Murro w 
and his reports, 
Willia m Shire
 at first from 
B erlin
, then 
elsewhere. I still na -- I still know all th
e reporters, and you basically pu -- could 
put everything together and it looked pr
etty bleak for awhile, but I think we 
q u i ck ly  ab so rb ed  A m
erican optimism.  
Q: What about being aware of wh
at was happening to the Jews? 
A: We knew it was bad, but there was a 
sense of helplessness. I re member th e 
episode with the 
Sa int Louis
, which was absolutely u
nbelievable, that -- we 
worshipped 
Roosevelt,
 who at the same time was such
 a political animal that he 
would do anything to -- ba

litically expedient. And of 
course, it™s easy to say that in retrospect

A: Well, we knew ab out
 Da cha u
 very er -- early on.
 Dachau
 was established 
before 1938. I was absolutely flabbergastedwhen I looked at th
e map, to see  how 
close 
Auschwitz
 was to 
Gleiwitz
, and when we were back there, I took that one 
day trip into the area from 
czechsla --
 from the 
Czech Republic
, and when I 
looked at the map I was flabbergasted. In 
fact, I had a very interesting -- got a very 
interesting letter from the 
Holocaust Museum last week
, forwarding a letter that 
they received from
 Gleiwitz
 that in -- the local organization in 
Gleiwitz
 has -- I 
forgot the exact name, someth
ing for international relati
ons, is going to dedicate a 
memorial to the Jewish comm
unity, at the site of the sy
nagogue. When I was there 
seven years ago, it was a rundown playground with asphalt and not a plaque, 
nothing. And th e Jewish old ag e home became
 a police station. After that visit, 
everything else was pretty mu ch unchanged,
 but I couldn™t wait to get out and they 
-- I now got notice that they™re dedicating a 
memo rial on the site of the synagogue 
and that the dedication is
 going to be on the 28
th
 and 29
th
 of October. And my wife 
and I and my  three kids, and 
Joe
 and his family are going there for the dedication. 
Also visiting 
Berlin

want to show the kids our roots, and I also want to show the people who are doing 

this that it™s about time. That™s

. In fact, when I wrote the letter 
of acceptance that we™re all comin g , and I 
mentioned the European titles, that all

my children are being doctors and lawyers,
 all have the European titles as doctors, 
that we™re coming and that I hope th
e visit will be a very productive and 

memo rable experience for all of us and th
em. And that™s the reason I feel strongly 
about going. I si -- it still 
hasn™t been determined whet
her they™re financing it, but 
I™m willing to finance it, because I think 
it is for a good cau
se, even though a 
couple of my  kids disagree. 

Q: Will you be speaking to any groups over there? 
A: Apparently yes. I don™t know what the 
language barrier is going to be. Bu t the 
head of the organization writes perfect E
nglish, so knowing th at mo st schools are 
bilingual, we should 
be able to communicate to so
me extent, although when we 
were there seven years ago in 
Opin
, that™s the town wher
e my  mo th er was b o r n, 
where I found the apartment where the bus
iness was and also where the Temple 
was, which is now a Russian style offi
ce building, I couldn™t communicate in 
either English or German. And when we went
 to a restaurant, we finally pointed to 
the table next to us, where they had so
up and a sandwich, and that™s how we ate 

lunch. So  it should be an interesting experience. 

Q: Let™s get back to the war. Any other men

Q: -- from the family, and -- and your pa

busy, was functioning and they  were doing
 worthwhile projects and so forth? 
A: They were definitely no
t only functioning, but became extremely active in any 
kind of relief efforts. And as I said
, it went to other causes after that. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Because that was their way of making 
up for the family th
at was lost, that 
philosophically our feeling 
is, you can™t replace what™s
 lost, but you can better 
what can be replaced. 

Q: Were you speaking to y
our family still in German? 
A: No. We stopped speaking German prob
ab ly within six months. But of course 
we all spoke with an accent, 
and I do not have very -- I am

graphic and picture person and I do no t have very mu ch  language talent. 

Therefore, I never heard the difference. 
And that™s the only way I can explain the 
fact that I reta -- I retain my accent after 65 years. 

Q: Then it™s the end of the war, and what
 was that like for you and your family? 
A: Well, that™s when everyt
hing unfolded and the rea

could be traced. In other words, it was finalized by

obvious that my  uncles never made -- never made it back to wh ere they came

energy positively and that was the family 

phi -- philosophy.  
Q: So you became a high schoo

 high school, and have 
a lot of interests? 
A: Very -- a lot of interests, yes. I c
onsider my self a reasonably good student. I 
participated in various clubs, a lot -- mo
stly political. And I 
guess it shaped me 
also in a fairly liberal philosophy that 
Jews have always pr
ospered in any fu  -- 
liberal society, and it™s important that ev
erybody has the rights that they™re entitled 
to because it rubs off. And I still thi -- I trav
el a lot, being that it™s my business, but 
I still kiss the ground every time we come
 home, whether I agr

not. 

Q: And then  you completed high school
, graduated from high school, and then  
what?

Western Reserve University
 and during my  sophomore year

ou feel that you would be a different 
person today if you hadn™t 
had the childhood and the experience that you went 
through? 

A: I™ve been -- let me answer
 it in a different way. I™ve met a fairly  substantial 
number of Germans and I confront the hi
story. I feel that the Holocaust is 

probably almost as much pa
rt of th e German psyche as it is the Jewish psyche. 
I™ve also noticed that the -- by the numbers
 that come to the Holocaust Museum. I 
feel I™ve had a much, mu
ch richer life in the 
United States
 than I ever would have 
had in 
Gleiwitz
, even if it hadn™t -- there hadn™t 
been a war or Ho locaust. So I 
sometimes use a statement in 
speaking to Germans, the be
st revenge is living well. 
And I believe in that philosophy and I 
think our children re
flect it, th at the 
opportunities, I™m talk ing 
about cultural and otherwis
e, that we™ve had in 
New 
York 
and 
Washin gton
 are far greater than anything 
we could have experienced in 
Upper Silesia
 in the best of times.  
Q: Ho-H ow did you co nvey  your relig
ious feelings to your ch ildren? 
A: We sent them to Sunday school. I™m
 a great believer that the two most 
important things you give yo
ur children are roots and wings. And they all not only 
went thro ugh Confirmation cl
ass, but they  all went thro ugh post-Confirmation

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Frank Liebermann
. This is tape number 
three, side
 A.
 When  did you change your name to 
Frank
? 
A: When I started working for a commercia
l firm. First th-there were two things 
which I had to do. One is sound American
, and change my  signatu re that nobody 
could read it, because at the time we were 
doing export business, the first customer 
I di -- I did correspondence with was 
M.B. Herrairi 
in 
Baghdad
. And when I 
wrote a letter and signed my  name, my  bo
ss said, this is some
thing you have to 
change immediately. And he signed just 
initials and ma ke a scribble and you never 
put any name, just initials, 
that we can tell w hom -- who you are, and then I just -- 
it was easier to be
 Frank
 because it™s a common name, people rememb er it better, 
and I had no trouble doing it. 
Q: How did your parents feel 
about your changing your name? 
A: No objection. Although my  father kept his name 
Hans,
 and he kept the second
 
N, 
because he said, I don™t want to be -- 
I don™t want to live with any kind of 
pretense. This is who I am and I don™t want to change it. My wife has adopted  that 
philo sophy and insists on th e two 
N™s
. She sa -- wh-when my kids went to camp 
and the comp any made mistake on the na
metags, she sent them back once,

because she™s very firm on it an
d my kids also retained the 
Liebermann 
with two 
N™s. 
Q: Did your children have a -- become a 
Bar 
and 
Bat Mitzvah
? 
A: Oh definitely. Again, we 
believe in -- we believe in studying and in the Jewish 
philo sophy that you really -- in o -- in or
der to defend yourself, you have to know 
who you are. And probably  the people who 
fared least well in the Holocaust were 
those who really didn™t know who they 
were. In other words, even the ones who 
converted were considered Jews. And they
 didn™t have the background to deal 
with it. And I would say this is one of 
the things I learned from the Holocaust.  
Q: Well, you were very young when  you
 went through what
 you did. When  your 
children were that age, did it bring, you kno
w, seven, eight, nine
 and so forth, did 
that -- did it bring back that part of y
our ch ildhood to  you, when  they were the 
same age? 
A: No, not really at that ag
e, but I know that my  children persuaded my  mo ther to 
write her autobiography, because they
 wanted their sense of history. 
Unfortunately, it was fairly late an d we
 had to do a lot of editing because she 
wrote a lot of notes originally. And I want
 to thank my  daught
er-in-law, who did a 
wonderful job on the computer
 in putting her various stor
ies together in a logical

way, which became difficult at the time sh
e did it, which was probably in her mid-
80™s. 
Q: What happens to you wh en you see a 
swastika now? What 
runs through your 
head? 

A: Since I -- I an -- I w ould say I have 
come to grips with
 it. I woul -- I™m 
saddened wh en I see it. I™m beyond angry. Ba
si -- as I say, I confront Germans at 
various times and I feel you can™t undo hist
ory, but you have to ta -- you have to 
learn from it. This is one reason why -- my 
wife managed to get me tickets for the 
consecration of the Holocaust Museum on th
at rainy, cold, miserable day, wh en  
there wasn™t a seat to be had in the part
 that was roped off for people who wanted 
to bear witness, while in front, the part that was left for the dignitaries was half 

empty. It™s also wa -- why, when I ha
d a chance, I volunteered at the museum, 
because I feel I can convey a message and 
I™m glad to be doing it. My kids are 
very much aware of their roots, and that
™s a reason wh y they are going on th e trip 
next month, because I said we be -- as 
a family believe in roots and wings.  
Q: Are you angry that you had to leave 
Germany
 and your family had to go 
through what it did, and you had the losse
s that you had, and 
other people didn™t? 
Let™s say Je ws here in the 
United States
?

A: Not at all. Look, we made the best of 
a bad situation. We were very fortunate. 
My father™s good fortune wa
s that he lost his living relatively early in 1936, and 
that he had the foresight to leav
e. My father-in-law, who left 
Vienna
, said you 
know, his good luck  was that he was not
 too old or too rich. Either of those 
circumstances made many people victims. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And early on it™s a very, very trauma
tic experience to move. I know it from 
New York
, or fro-from 
Great Neck 
to 
Washington
 that it wasn™t easy. Moving to  
a strange country is extremely hard. Bu t onc
e you do it and su cceed, I feel I could 
not have had the life that I™ve had, if 
we had stayed, forgetting about the politics 
and ev erything else that occurred. So, I™m 
certainly not angry, but I™m trying to be 
constructive. 

Q: How old were your childre
n wh en you told  them abou
t the loss of their -- their 
relatives? 
A: I don™t remember, b u t we made no secrets of it. No, it -- we™ve always been 
open. I™ve -- I™m not smart enough to keep  
secrets, because then you always have 
to rememb er what you s -- whom you said 
wh at to, and we kept
 various pictures. 
We still have albums of family that are --
 particularly my granddaughter has used 
for some of her art projects, and that™s pa
rt of our heritage, that we™re survivors.

Q: What does it mean to
 you to be a survivor? 
A: I™m happy to  have made the best of the situation. I™ve probably  become very  
family conscious on how important it is, 
and I think I™m try -- I™m trying to pass 
that on to  my  children and gran dchildren, 
with whom we try to travel and give 
them as many benefits as 
we can f -- as we can find, or as they™re willing to 
accept. That™s -- that™s all I can say. 

Q: Let™s talk about some of your political
 views. You -- you did allude to that 
before -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- because of what you went through. 
You want to le -- elaborate a little more? 
A: Well, I -- I would say I™m -- I -- I™ve be
come a student of history, Biblical and 
otherwise. And if you do th
at, you realize that the Jewish community has always 
done well in a free society. And therefor
e, I think there™s a reason why Jews tend 
to be liberal in their own self interest. 
And some of the trends we have th -- do 
worry me, because we don™t 
seem to be getting our mess
age across as well as we 
did in former years. In other words,
 I™m not -- when -- 
ev en  w h en  Sen a to r 
Lieberman
 mentions God too often, I don™t thin
k that™s -- that belongs in politics. 
Now, one of the things that made thin
gs so easy for the Ge
rmans is that the 
church es and synagogues were fun-funded by
 the state. In other words, you gave a

58
certain part of your taxes to go to th e ch
urch of your choice. And th erefore, they 
had complete records of what everybody 
was and thought, whether they were with 
them inic -- or against them. And I theref
ore don™t like some of the trends that we 
see now in fighting terrorism, of invading 
civil liberties. I mean
, I certainly don™t 
mind giving my name, but some of the ille
gal searches and so  
forth, scare me.  
Q: Does that remind you of 
Germ any
 in  the 30™s? 
A: That™s what I™m talking 
about. And being specific, Mr. 
Ashcroft, 
who I think is 
going over the line. So it has 
shaped my political views. 
Q: What are your thoughts about the State of 
Israel
? 
A: Well, I am very sad that the middle 
in the world is lo
sing power. In other 
word s, the extra -- you only hear from the 
extremes, in other word s, the right wing 
or the left wing. The only way that that 
conflict will ever be solved is through 
some fairly  tough compromises on bothsides. And the further we go to the 
extremes, the harder it™s going to
 be to come to
 terms with it. 
Q: What are your thoughts about the necessity for a State of 
Israel
? 
A: Look, it™s -- it certainly 
-- I™m very much for the st
ate, even though I wasn ™t 
always. I didn™t want a nationalistic -- I di
dn™t want to be iden
tified with policies 
with whi-which I disagree. At this point I 
believe it™s here to stay, it™s -- when the 
whole wo rld closed, if we had had a State of 
Israel
, that wouldn™t have happened.

Philoso phically
, I think the 
Likud
 policy of trying to pr
esser -- of the occupied 
territories is contrary to Jewish la -- to Je
wish law and contrary to Jewish interests, 
because they™re trying to create a 
South Africa
, where we have -- you can™t be a 
religious state where some people are more 
equal than others. And there is merit in 
-- if you want to have a Jewish state, it ha
s to be pretty mu ch limited to the Jewish 

population and you can™t be Im
perialist. Because strictly on basis of the increased 
birthrate, if they carry 
it on the way it was done in 
Lebanon
, where it used to be 
50-50, and then you had a ru
ling minority, that is poison 
for stability. So I™m -- 
I™m thinking of it again from a philosophical
 rather than a political point of view. 
Q: And you are concerned about 
the stability of the State of 
Israel
? 
A: Certainly as an occu pying powe
r, it can™t work in  the long run. 
Q: Did you have -- or
 did you follow th e 
Eichmann
 trial, and wh at were your 
thoughts when th
at was going on? 
A: Look, he was a mo nster. I had -- I don™
t think that he c
ould get justice, no 
matter what happened. And I suppose it wa
s expedient to get rid of him, even 
though a -- I think they were successful 
in not making him a ma
rtyr, but there was 
a danger of that. Sometimes a 
MacArthur
 idea of old soldiers, sometimes if th ey 
could have faded away, it probably would have
 been ju st as good. In other word s, 
I™m not a revenge person, but I™m not always
 sure that that™s 
for the best in the

same way that eye for an eye, tooth 
for a tooth, wh ich they are doing in 
Israel
, 
because it just creates more unrest a
nd more anger. On the other hand, I 
understand that you can™t let yourself beco
me a victim without reacting. It™s a 
dilemma.  
Q: Do you feel Germ
an in any way now? 
A: No. In fact, my -- I am 
much more sensitive, though, 
to German characteristics, 
which probably wouldn't bother somebody
 else, they do bother me. I™m talking 
about the pushine
ss that I™ve -- I™ve gone through 
Germ any
 in part. In a store, if 
they have the sale, they go with elbows
. That probably both
ers me more than it 
would bother somebody else. Or the very 
rigid bureaucrats. So I™m sensitive to 
those characteristics, b u t I try to avoid them. 

Q: So you have no emotional 
attachment in the sense of
 the place you were born. 
A: None at all. None at all. In fact, I 
once got in a conversati
on with a tra -- when 
we were on a ferry in 
New Zealand
. I got on fairly early  and I got a very good 
seat and opposite me sat -- someb o dy came 
in later and said in German to the 
neighbor, I wonder where I can get somethin
g to eat. And I gave him directions in 
German. So he looked at me and said
, how come you speak such good German? 
And I gave him the answer, translated, 
I was once German. And he said, how can 
you say that, it™s your Fatherland. I said, 
not for me. And I got into a discussion

with him. His father was a minister and he hadn™t really come to grips a fact th at 
he didn™t speak up. And I think I had him 
in tears during that trip. He was a tour 
leader for 
Budget Tour
. We were going on a f -- in a 
fairly comfortable way. And 
that™s where I originally started using the 
term, the best revenge is living well. And 

I™ve used it several times since, but that 
really  brought it up. And that sums up my 
-- my German feelings.  

Q: Let™s talk a little bit now about the 
Holocaust Museum. Y
ou did mention that 
your wife arranged for tickets for the open
ing ceremonies, but wh at was your first 
encounter with the museum?  

A: Well, at the opening, I had to take 
a woman from the Temp le sisterhood on the 
condition that I take her out for lunch. Wh
ich I dutifully did and I went through it 
and of course I heard the protest of six m
illion lies right across the street. It was a 
very emotional mo rning. And then  I just 
felt I wanted to bear
 witness. But after 
September 11
th
, when the travel business really 
collapsed, and for a month we did 
nothing but give credits and retur -- arrange
 for refunds for the 
days that nobody 
could travel, I was ask ed to work three da
ys a week, and I took the course at the 
mu seum, and I started to volunteer. Now my
 -- my agency asked 
me to  co me b ack  
in January , and I told  her look, once they™v
e invested their time, I feel I have an

oblig ation. And ever since I™ve been doing 
that Thursd ay morni
ng, then I work the 
rest of the time. I get th -- I get to the office by ab out two o™clock. 
Q: So you™ve been working at 
the mu seum since January  2002? 
A: Actually, yeah, si
nce the fall of 2001. 
Q: Right, after September 11
th
, and then you took -- 
A: Yeah, it™s almost two years.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: It™ll be two years fing -- December first. 
Q: In between the time of the open
ing in ™93, and -- and September 11
th
, 2001, 
what was your contact with the museum? 
A: Just that I had gone a couple of times
. I decided to donate my  grandparent™s 
busin ess papers, which my  mo ther kept w
ith all kinds of correspondence, and th e 
bookkeep er had preserved 
them, and whatever other letters we had in our 
collection, because I felt my kids can™t 
read German, I can barely read German 
because the grammar is so 
cumbersome that I may as 
w ell give it to somebody 
who can -- who can use it. So I™ve had that
 relationship with them, and I had gone 
a couple of times, and of course, I™d recommended it.

whom I gave tickets to, ab
out how moved they were. 
Q: What kind of wo rk

A: I™m just information, 
you know. Greeting, elevators, tickets, information -- 
Q: So you™re in vi -- yo

A: Visitor services, exactly. And frankly,
 I enjoy th e once a week, invigorating 
experience of going to the 
mall area and interesting pe
ople that we meet at the 
mu seu m. 

Q: Has working there affected your 
me mo ries of your early childhood? 
A: Not really. No, I have no -- I am -- I 
am past the point of being emotionally 
repressive or -- in other words, I -- I ha
ndle it in an unemotional way now. Even 
though when  I gave th e lecture and put it 
all together, at the end I was tearful. 
Q: Wh-W hen you gave a lecture --

Q: When  you™re at the mu seum and you™ve
 gone thro ugh th e exhibit in the fifth 
floor, in the 1930™s in 
Germany

A: The one that really got me -- 
oh, sh -- one second, I turn it off 
[tape break] 
-- 
not re -- the one that I got -- probably wa
s mo st emotional about was the present 
exhibit on th e children. 
Q: This is the hidd en children exhibit. 

A: Yes. And the last ti -- wa -- ag
ain, when I was emotional is in 
ﬁSchindler™s 
List
ﬂ when they lead the child
ren away. That™s somethi
ng that I can™t come to 
terms with, and I think of my cousin, who 
when we left she was three years old. 
Q: And who did not survive. 

A: Who did not surv ive. I mean
, none of the children su rvived . 
Q: Mm-hm. Do you identify 
with the child
ren yourself? 
A: No, no, no. I mean, I identify as what
 happened to -- ch
ildren were totally 
helpless and -- and I would sa -- it™s probabl

trauma. But by being represen
ted as somebody who is auth
entic, I think it adds to 
the experien ce of people at th
e mu seum, and I do get asked.  
Q: You get asked wh at? 
A: Whether I was a survivor. And I say ye
s, even though I don™t believe it my self. 
In other words, the category of survivor
 is somebody who really went through 
some of the hell which happ
ened after Crystal Night. 
Q: What are your feelings wh en  you walk into  the building? 

A: I think it™s a fabulous piece of arch
itecture. In other words, the somewhat 
disjointed lo ok is, I think, a marvelous  achievement. People often ask me, you 
know, about the map that they
 give out. And I said, it re
ally doesn ™t help because 
people didn™t know from one mo ment to th
e next wh at™s going to happen. So  you 
can™t put that in a map. That™s my standard comment. 

Q: Do you feel like you belong there? Th
ere™s a connection to  the mu seum for 

you? 
A: Yes. In other words, I feel that 
somewhere I can contribute more than I 
probably could elsewhere. 
Q: But I meant an emotional 
connection when you walk in. 
A: Ah, I do not tend to be that emotio nal. In other words, I appreciate the 

happenings and I -- I try to ra -- I try to 
believe in reason over emotion. Not that I

don™t get emotional, but this is not -- I don™
t have the connection that way, except I 
think that it -- that it™s an important pa
rt of education and I have taken -- I™ve 
invited -- for instance, I™ve invited my kids
 and grandchildren to
 the celebration of 
survivors, November first. And I think 
that™s important. But from an educational 
point of view , rather than a st
rict emotional point of view. 
Q: What are your thoughts about th
e non-Jewish staff and volunteers? 
A: They again -- it depends wh ich ones. So me
 of them are strictly business, others 
are really devoted. And also
 in th -- among the volunteers are some  non-Jewish 
volunteers. You don™t know wh at reasons people have for reacting. So-S ome of 
them take it strictly they
™ve had experience in mu seums and it™s a museum job. 
Others do it because they f
eel it -- it™s particularly 
important. And both kinds of 
people are useful. No other comments.  

Q: Do you go to  many of th
e lectures and presentations? 
A: I don™t have time, b ecause I leave ther
e and go directly to work. If they have 
something in  the even ing, preferably on 
weekends, it™s much 
easier than during 
the week. Course I -- I get home around quar
ter to six. By the time I have dinner 
during th e week, that™s -- that ma kes for a long day -- we -- and we go to  the

Q: You had said that the hidden children 
exhibit was particularly me aningful for 
you. Are there any other exhibits in the 
permanent collection that -- or any other 
temporary exhibits that really were very
 memorable, or are very memorable for 
you? 
A: Again, they have all 
been very  educational, whether it™s bringing up th e book 
burning and the intellectual philoso phy of race superiority and so forth, which was 

popular in -- throughout the wo
rld, it was just taking th at to an extreme. And I say 
one of the -- one of th e things that™s unbe
lievable about the Nazi movement is the 
high emotional pitch that it could get to. 
And that™s such a danger sign that it still 
hasn™t been explained to me. In other 
words, how the political rallies can be so 
devastating. On so -- so-called educated pe
ople. That™s the reason I tr -- I try to be 
unemo tional.  
Q: Because it™s dangerous
 to be emotional. 
A: Yes. You said it in different words. 
Q: Has the world learned lessons 
from the Holocaust, do you think? 
A: I wish it really had, but the fact that
 it™s recognized hopefu
lly will be helpful. 
We probab ly won™t know fo r a
nother two or three generations. 
Q: In closing, do you have any messa
ge to those two or three generations?

A: Unless you lear -- unless you study histor
y, you can repeat mistak es. That™s the 
reason I™ve been -- i -- the Holo
caust really has made me  look at history, including 
by th e way, the re-religious history of th
e New Testament, or rather the -- the 
Christian Bible, to be correct. That
 in making it the national religion of 
Rome, 
Constantine 
basically had to absolve the Romans. 
And therefore, it was easiest to 
blame the Jews. And that is not an uncomm
on way of interpreting 
history, that it™s 
always written by the victors, about the peop
le who can™t answer, after the fact. So 
the study of accurate history is extremel
y imp o rtant and history is generally not 
taught very well, as to what the real i
ssues are. I think that™s the end of my  
thought. 
Q: Anything else you™d like to add befo re we close? 
A: I don™t think so. Anyway , th
ank you for a nice interview. 
Q: Thank you very much for doing 
the interview. This concludes the

States

seum interview with
