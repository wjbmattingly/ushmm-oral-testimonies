Q: OK. I'd like to begin by asking you your complete name . 

 

A: It's uh Frederic L. Bernard. 

 

Q: And where and when were you born?  

 

A: I was born on August the 7th, 1912 in Czernow
itz, the capital of Bukovina. It was, until 
1918, part of the old Austrian-Hungarian m
onarchy. In 1918, it was uh given to to ...by the 
powers to Roma nia; and in 1940 it was occ
u...on uh June the 28th, 1940, it was occupied by 
the Soviets as compensation for twenty years of Roma nian occupation of Bessarabia. It 

hadn't been for over two hundred years part of
 any Russian empire. It...I would say it was 
occupied as a result of the Stalin-Hitler pact, 
and uh the same criteria should apply to it as 
they applied today to the Baltic States. Uh in 
these forty years, the Russians have been able 
to change demographically the population of C
zernowitz. Interesting is the fact that they 
have attracted a large group of Russian Jews to Czernowitz... 
 

Q: OK. We'll come to some of these stories. I would like to ask you to describe your childhood 
before World Wa r II, when you were growing up. 
 

A: Uh, I uh...as I told you I was born in Czernowitz
. The name  of the street in Roma nia was 
Marshal Fosh number 9. Uh it...my father was uh 
the chief clerk in a large lawyer's office, 
Dr. Hodrover. He had the title of solicitator, whic
h is not the same as a solicitor in the United 
States. It uh...he was uh...he did not speak Ro
ma nian. He spoke only German, and so 
naturally when the Romanian entered in 1918 
he lost uh his qualifications, not knowing the 
Romanian language. As a solicitator, he had to write even not being a lawyer to plead in 

lower courts, mi nor cases, uh breach of contr
act for one. And his anti-Romanian attitude 
probably reflected itself also in our attitude 
in the beginning. Later going to high school, the 
lyc√©e, in uh...in Czernowitz he spoke ___(ph). I 
had one sister uh uh who uh studied later 
with me at the University in Prague. She st
udied pharmacy. I studied medicine. I uh took the 
baccalaureate--or the uh matura--in 1930 and uh 
uh my sister and I went to Prague, 
Czechoslovakia, to matriculate at the German University in Prague. In that time, 

Pra...Czechoslovakia, Prague had two uh unive
rsities. Two me dical...a German and and a uh 
Czech. We...we matriculated at the German
 university. She went to the uh pharmacy 
department. I went to the medical school. It wa
s the Karls (ph) University in Prague. It 

doesn't  exist today anymore. Today there is only one, Czech.  
 

Q: And your mother. Could you tell me a little about your mother? 

 

A: My mother came from the southern part 
of Bukovina. Cimpulung, she uh they were ma rried. 
My mother had uh studied the piano in Vienna
. She uh she uh finished the conservatory I

think at the age of eighteen. She was a fine pi
anist, excellent uh uh accompanist. As a matter 
of fact, she accompanied uh uh a well-known singe
r by the name of Selma Kurtz in Vienna 
uh as an accompanist. She had a fine technique but uh marrying my father, this uh really 
brought an end to her music career. She played fo
r us and uh instilled in us the the love for 
music, especially since her specialty was 
uh uh lied[er]. You know, I was familiar with 
lied[er] as a small child. 
 

Q: Could you describe the life for Jews at that time in your childhood?  

 

A: Czernowitz had a very active uh uh Jewish co
mmunity, culturally. Uh the Jewish community 
had produced quite a few remarkable people in
 Jewish uh uh cultural, in Jewish cultural 
history. Itzic Manger (ph)  is one of the uh 
these figures and the well-known and famous, uh 
fablist (ph) is this could be the term which I could use...he was uh...I just mi ssed the 

name...uh, well I'll come back. Eliezer Steinbe...S
teinberg (ph). Eliezer Steinberg wrote 
beautiful fables fables in Yiddish. It uh...C
zernowitz had a permanent Yiddish theater, uh 
Goldfaden_ Theater. It had a permanent uh German and Romanian theater, national theater 

they called it, which was a replica of the uh 
of the opera from Vienna. Beautiful building. 
Excellent acoustics and uh uh there were uh so
-called part-time German, uh Ukrainian and 
and uh Polish uh cultural organizations. Uh in...a
s soon as Hitler came to power in Germany, 
things changed. The Germans...we had a large German population in...out in the suburbs, 

especially which were uh uh...not Schwabian...I
 don't know from where they uh really 
came...and uh their political uh attitude changed. 
Hitler and his propaganda mi nistry were 
quite active and the same happened in the ot
her German colonies in Romania. Romania 
had...in Bessarabia there were Schwabian coloni
es which were for a long time already that 
they came to Bessarabia under Katherine the 
Second. Uh then Transylvania had uh Saxon, 
especially in the southern part Fagaras-Brasov. Uh the Banat had also Schwab Germans and 

uh naturally as their attitude toward Jews and uh and uh as apparent of the new National 

Socialist inclination of the German people, uh 
uh fell on a very fertile ground. Uh in the late 
'30's the uh Romanian government fell under th
e influence of the Iron Guard, first Cuza-
Goga, then governme nt, then the Iron...then the 
Iron Guard had a tremendous influence. It 
was very anti-Semitic. It was a chauvinistic
 movement which aligned itself uh intimately 
with Hitler under Marshall Antonescu to a degr
ee where they took part in the anti-Soviet 
campaign with uh two armi es. So did the 
Hungarians and uh voluntary uh the voluntary uh 
divisions from Spain and from France, 
does not ma tter (ph), and from Belgium. 
 

Q: And from the time you graduated me dical school in  1930?  

 

A: No, no, no, no. 1936. Thirt...I started me dical school in 1930. I left Prague in 1933. I was for 
three years there, a student at the German 
University. I uh...the uh students at the German 
University were between seventy and eighty percent Nazis and uh their attitude toward the 

Jews was well known. I went from
 there to Strasbourg , France, but uh not being...uh France 
having a different system of studies which 
was completely different fr om the German 
system...the French medical studies were ther
e yearly studies and you have to pass every 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
3
 
 
year an exam in order to be admitted to th
e next year. The German University had a a uh 
different ____(ph). You had three riguroza (ph) 
of which every five seme sters you have to 
finish, so uh they didn't recognize my third year. In order not to loose it I went later via Basel 
uh Swiss, Switzerland to Italy because I found 
out that Italy had had reciprocity with 
England. Reciprocity lasted until 1940. The uh the uh Italian system...uh well you had to 

pass a special exam in order to be admitted 
to the to the British Medical Council. Eur...uh 
Europe in that time was full of people who want
ed to leave Europe because of Hitler. Many 
succeeded. Many did not. I was admitted to the 
British Medical Council. I secured a landing 
permit for Australia and in the end I ended up in spite of everything in Poland.  
 

Q: Tell me what happened to you at that time, once the Nazis came?  

 

A: In uh in uh...I found myself...the Nazis a
ttacked Russia on uh June the 22nd, 1941. Uh I was 
uh in that time working under the Russians...oh 
yes...I forgot to tell you that in 1940 I uh, 
June the 22nd...I...23rd, 1940...I ma rried Gusti Klier,
 also born uh also living in Czernowitz 
and I had returned from the Transylvania from
 Cluj to Czernowitz to get married. I uh was 
an assis...a voluntary assistant at that time at the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of the 

University in Cluj and I was supposed to come
 back. My uh then father-in-law asked me to 
stay with him after the marri
age for a week. I uh...and this was Sunday, the 23rd. On Friday, 
the 28th the Russian tanks entered uh Czernow
itz and my return could not take place 
anymore. I worked as a uh ear, nose and throat 
man in the First City 
Hospital in Czernowitz 
and at the Second Polyclinic, also in  Czernow
itz. I had two, two and a 
half jobs as they 
called staukas (ph). Uh still not enough to make a good...a living. Conditions were tight, very 

lousy in Russia and uh and uh one really had a ha
rd time. My wife also worked in that time 
as the head of a cooperative and uh with her and my salaries we could barely uh make ends 

meet. At the...as soon as Hitler attacked Ru
ssia uh on June the 22nd, 1941, three months later 
I found myself in the uh western part of the 
Ukrainia uh uh east of Kame nets Podolski and I 
tried to ma ke my way back to to uh...and we 
ended up in Kame nets Podolski in the western 
Ukraine. There we me t...uh we were a group of
 three physicians. Uh Gabriel Zinreich, my 
friend and his wife and his fa
ther-in-law. Uh Frank uh uh...I think his first name  was 
Solomom Frank and from Brasov both his...wer
e from Transylvania whose uh native tongue 

was Hungarian. In Kame nets Podolski we found 
Hungarian uh troops and again one of these 
uh uh seldom happened really a mi racle.
 Uh I uh...in 1936...and I'm comi ng back, uh going 

back...in 1936 after I graduated I returned to Czer
nowitz and went from there to Bucharest to 
take the license in Bucharest. My parents liv
ed in Czernowitz. My mother was still alive. I 
wasn't  married in that time and uh I passed the 
uh the exam which was not quite easy. It is 
the...they called it the notification (ph) and I got
 an off...an offer to have a locum tenence 
(ph) near the Hungarian border in Transylvania
 and uh uh I earned quite a lot. I wasn't  uh I 
wasn't  ma rried and I ate in the house of a Hunga
rian priest whose wife came  from uh uh the 
northern part of Transylvania. And while 
being in Kame nets Podolski...now I'm comi ng 
back...now again '41...we me t some body who was from...a sergeant picked us up from the 

Hungarian army and he happened to be from Sa
lonta, Szatmar area from Transylvania. He 

uh he apparently knew about what's going to ha
ppen to the Jews in in uh in the Ukrainia 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
4
 
 
because uh when I established that I knew some body 
from from       Salonta where he was 
from...it turned out that the mother-in-law of th
e priest in whose house I ate in in a little town 
in Transylvania by the name  of uh of uh Beiu
s, Ujlak...uh he said this is no place for you to 
be. You have to go to Hungary. Jews in Hunga
ry in that time, 1941, were still alright. We 
had...Gabriel Zinreich, my friend, 
had a Hungarian-speaking wife and he put us on a truck to 
Munkacs. But in order to get to Munkacs we had to pass through Poland, through the 

General Government, and it happens that when 
we passed the bridge uh over the Dniester in 

Horodienka we got picked up by Hungarian 
gendarmerie, uh beaten and uh we ended up 

later in the ghetto, in a little ghetto in Poland. And here started our Polish episode which had 

to...which turned out to last the whole war 
and ended up in 1944 where I joined the Polish 
army.  
 

Q: Tell me about the time in the ghetto. 

 

A: The ghetto where we ended...where we lived wa
s a little town. It, it was fascinating to me. I 
had never seen a uh a uh an establishment like Ko
rolovka (ph). It was a small town. It had no 
railroad station. It had no sanitation. It had 
no water supply. It had no electricity. It uh...you 
had a wasser treiger (ph) who had to bring 
the water to the people who paid him. You 
uh...you uh...there were approximately sixteen to 
eighteen hundred Jews in that little ghetto. 
It was a natural ghetto. It was like a stetl fr om
 the time of, which Shalom Alehem described. 
I have never been in such a stetl and uh for me it was really fascinating to to to to study it. It 

uh...one doctor. One Jewish doctor. One Jewish de
ntist. The doctor was Dr. Teibers (ph) and 
everyone had a sufix in Yiddish. Dr. Teib
ers was called Tiberhazel. The dentist was 
called...his name was Gunie Wi esenthal...was ca
lled Gunie Pipick (ph) because he was uh 
heavy. Uh the Jews lived around a remi ck (ph), th
e ring platz (ph) in the center of which was 
a pharmacy. Magister Schwartz was the the pharmacist. These were attached houses but the 

the Germans didn't really need to establish a 
ghetto. There was a natural ghetto right there. 
They just established that no gentile had...be permitted to come into that area and no Jew is 

permitted to go out. It was difficult to reinforce 
this because the borders of that ghetto were 
quite uh loose, so it happened that these Jews 
were able to communicate with the farmers. 
Having done comme rce and business with them fo
r so ma ny years, they knew each other and 
uh life was naturally easier than in the bigger cities. Uh we had problems with food. I saw 

immediately that uh uh I have to to do somethi
ng to uh to establish a 
source of food and uh I 
went to that Dr. Teibers if he could direct to 
me his uh overflow. He  said there is really no 
overflow at this time, and you know, uh in that
 time you didn't pay for a visit. You, you...the 

farmers or the people who came for me dical consultation paid in uh in food. So...but he 

said...and he gave this advice. If you get the permission to practice outside the ghetto in the 

little community, because there are no doc
tors around here, uh we...you you could uh you 
could survive. I would like to mention here the 
attitude of the Jews in that little ghetto. When 

I came in, the Russian had left. The Russian 
had been there, in Korolovka, since the 
seventeenth of uh September of uh 1939 when th
ey entered the eastern part of Poland, and 
there was...the attitude of the Jews was not 
uh friendly towards the Soviets. Many Jews had 
been deported. So were ma ny Ukrainian who ha
d been deported, especially Ukrainians who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
5
 
 
belonged to the National uh Nationalistic orga
nization. Ukrainians were very uh very 
nationalistic in their political aspiration and as 
soon as Hitler attacked Russia, the area was 
flooded with uh leaflets in which uh they uh we
re proclaiming that the time had come to 
establish the uh Volna Ukraina (ph), that means the free Ukraine. The leaflets were signed by 
a Ukrainian uh uh uh leader by the name  of St
ephan Bandera  who established a group of 
people later who uh carried his name and they were called Banderovitsis (ph). Very anti-

Semitic and very anti-Soviet. They said the tim
e has come to proclaim the fr ee Ukraina, to 
kill the Jews and the Communists. The uh...I
 didn't know how to go about getting the 
permission and I was directed to 
what the chief of the Judenrat , the Judenaltester who was a 
ma n by the name  of Max Glickstern, Glickster
n. Max Glickstern was married to a uh woman 

from the Bukovina by the name  of Hilda, Hild
a uh Zinreich and was a cousin of the, my 
friend Gabriel Zinreich, so I had access to him.
 He was a businessman who never did very 
well, but when he came to the ghetto he was 
already nominated to be the elder of the 
Judenrat . Uh he uh lived like a king really. 
He had power. Also, being a small community 
but the powers uh con...uh con...confer power to 
a human being and his attitude changes 
completely and uh it did on uh Max too. While I w
ould have to say that in many instances he 
behaved very honestly, still people who had money 
to bribe and the Judenrat was bribable to 

a very, very large degree. So was everybody. 
Uh there's...uh belonging to their admi ni....to 
the so-called Jewish admi nistration uh he gave
 me a uh a...he got for me letter signed by a 
priest in a small community uh outside Koro
lovka by the name  of Bicewslote (ph). He 
directed me. He sent letters to the uh lecaspoiut
ove (ph) which was the Kr
eisars (ph)  of the 
of the Ukrainian physician who was in charge 
of the area, and he gave me permission to 
the...uh to practice there. The letter from the priest was signed by a priest by the name of 

Stamosese (ph) who was the leader of the Uk
rainian organization. And we were brought by a 
uh uh ma n whose family later survived the war by the name  of Sturme r who was a person 

who had intimate contact with the farmers around Korolovka. He still managed to keep a 

couple of horses hidden in someplace outside th
e ghetto and he brought us to Benceslote 

(ph) and now started for me a a very interes
ting uh uh practice. It lasted no more than six 
months because the area was later declared in
 May uh '42 Judenrein . When we came there 
uh he brought us to the house of the ma n by the 
name  of Samy Reinstein who had a who had 
a dwelling where he had what they call it propinatzia. He sold liquor, schnaps and uh small 

uh items to the farmers. Right now he didn't have 
any more that store and he was able to rent 
us a few uh a couple of rooms. Uh the next day 
he he told me I should go to introduce myself 
to the priest being the leader of the comm
unity. Father Shamosheshin (ph) spoke some 
German. He was a lean mean in his early fi
fties or late forties. He uh uh was very non-
committal. He said for twenty-five years I had asked the Polish government uh to send a 

physician here. Uh the Germans had to come finally to make it possible for Benceslote to 

have a physician. Benceslote was also known that 
it had a large estate belong to an absentee 

land-lord by the name  of Count Sapira (ph). The count...the estate had been uh taken over by 

the Soviets and transformed into a state farm 
and the Germans left  it the same  way. A week 
later an event occurred which uh which was 
important. Some body knocked at the window of 
our of our room and uh when...Mr. Reinstei
n, Samy Reinstein opened the door, he said 
Doctor, it's for you. They want you to come  imme di
ately to the priest. The wife of the priest 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
6
 
 
is sick. I, having his assurances that this, th
e call was genuine because I was afraid to go in 
the mi ddle of the night, I uh...the
 ma n who who had come  for me  was a militant (ph) from 
the militia, Ukrainian militia. I found the uh the wife
 of the priest in severe upper abdominal 
pain. She had a gall bladder attack, gall stones.
 She said she had it for many years. She was 
in agony. She was perspired, begging to help he
r and so was her husband, uh the priest. I had 
one ampule (ph) of a synthetic morphine opi
um (ph) preparation, ______, which I gave her 
and uh she promptly vomited as soon as I  gave it 
to her, even before I thought it. But she fell 
asleep and uh I left her for a couple of hours 
and I came next morning. I found her in uh in 
uh the kitchen cooking, full of enthusiasm. Doct
or, you cured me. I said what do you mean. I 
was told the only cure for me was an operation a
nd here I am free. I feel fine. It is possible 
that the injection had relieved the spasm and the stones had passed into the small intestine 
and uh and uh  I really cured her. (laughter)  As a result of it next Sunday as Samy Reinstein 

told me, the priest in church in his sermon 
to the community said you can do what you want 
with our local Jews...there were twelve or fift
een Jewish families still in Benceslote (ph) but 
the Romanian doctor you shouldn't touch. And the term Romanian doctor remained with us 

for the whole time while I was in Poland. Uh 
a week later we were honored with a fat 
roasted duck sent by the priest with his thanks. 
Interesting. And a week later when I came to 
visit his wife, he was very friendly. Took me  
into the uh into the basement uh and said I 
would like to show you some thing. He showed
 me  a book published many years before. It 
was called Zolotaknina Hatmana Skoropatzkoro (ph), the Golden Book of the Hatman 

Skoropatzki. Skoropatzki was one of the  ha
tmans who had fought in the early twenties 
during the civil war against the new Soviet 
power. The the group...the soldiers of hatman 
Skoropatzki were known to have performe d, to have quite killed ma ny Jews. Among the 

pictures in that book, he showed me a pict
ure...he said that's me. Wa s a young ma n in 
military uniform with a C C on his uh collar. C C 
is S S...it's the...but it has nothing to be the 
German SS. He said it it it is Sichobeitselie Kovetz (ph). Sich (ph) was the national fighting 

organization of the Ukrainian uh uh Nationalis
t uh moveme nt and uh Father Shamosheshin 
was the leader in his community. His word mean
t law there. Whatever Father Shamosheshin 
said, went. Naturally, we were now some how 
under the protection of Father Shamosheshin. 
A month later an event took place which really
 uh was a lucky incident. One night some body 
rang the bell uh...rang the bell...knocked on 
my door...no bell...knocked on the window. It 
was, as it turned out, a Polish refugee who ha
d...from Wa rsaw who had tried in 1939 to to go 
by car to Roma nia. We  were not far from 
the Roma nian border, some  hundred and fifty 
kilometers, and his car broke down near Bielce 
(ph) and he couldn't...and before he could 
repair the car the Soviets had uh marched i
n, had closed the border, and his name  was 

Zarenski or Zarubski. He was a young engineer
 from Wa rsaw. He said please come . My 
wife is dying. I came to his house and I found her almost bled out. She had a vaginal 

bleeding. She had an incomplete abortion and 
what she needed was a little scraping. She was 
almost in coma. She she had a pulse of
 over 200. She...,there was no uh uh her blood 
pressure was extremely low. I I told him to ge
t immediate some transportation to take her to 
the hospital. In Borosow (ph) it was the nearest 
hospital, but there was also a railroad station. 
I knew a couple of doctors...one Doctor un Rabi
nowitz (ph) and Dr. Ro
senblatt (ph) who uh 
they are able to perform a uh 
a uh D&C. As soon as we brought her in they did the D&C. Uh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
7
 
 
she stopped bleeding. They kept her for three or
 four days in the hospital and uh I want you 
to know this was a time there weren't knowi
ng the transfusions. There were no even 
transfusions. That operating room had no 
oxygen. Nothing. No suction. Nothing, but it 
functioned. It was 19 uh 41, '42 now. It uh...he br
ought her home and a week later he showed 
up in uh where I worked, embraced me  and 
said Doctor, I don't know, I don't have the 
money to or how to pay you, but reme mber if 
the time will...I know you have a hard time...if 
circumstances will come that you will need help, come to me. I took it as a uh as an empty 
uh uh thank you and didn't pay too much attention, 
but it stayed, stayed in the back of my 
mi nd and really later it it uh uh was a lucky inci
dent. When the area was declared Judenrein 
we returned to the ghetto. Do you want to ask me  some thing?    
 

Q: No. It's  fine. 

 

A: It's alright?   We returned to the ghetto a
nd now a very hard life. Uh food. Food and during 
the summe r of '42  we heard that this was 
the rumor that the _______ of the Gestapo from 
Stanislow (ph) is around in the area liquidating 
ghettos. That means aktion. We established a 

uh guard every house. In that time I stayed in 
the house of a certain Aaron Spotheim, in the 
ghetto. Aaron Spotheim had a ______ of 
______. ______, that me ans how much. That 
means he was a bad ma n. He was really a
...not a very friendly uh person. Uh the whole 
ghetto real...uh really didn't like him very much but
 he he uh let us in and so we were happy 

there and with his help when the aktion star...i
n the area started, we we decided to build our 
own bunker or our own front. Being uh wh
at he was, ____ ________, he said nobody should 
know it. I don't want anybody to come in to th
at, in to that uh hiding place from our 
neighbors. So nobody really knew about our hidi
ng place. I thought in that time that our 
hiding place was a good hiding place. We  ha
d...you know, the houses in the ghetto, around 

the _____ were attached houses. The house attached to Mr. uh to Mr. Spotheim's house had a 

smaller uh roof. We decided to took the border between two houses to separate and create 

between the attics as a hiding place. Later I
...when I compared our hiding place with the 
others, I felt it was probably the flimsiest hi
ding place or bunker which existed. It had only 
one positive thing. Nobody knew about it. I wa
s witnessing...looking out from when the 
aktion took place and seeing in what ways they 
collected the people in to what they called 
the Umshagplatz (ph) there in the ghetto, because because they had to take them, to take the 

Jews by large lorries to ____, uh to Borszczow to
 to transport them by train to uh...our area 
went to the annihilation camp in...oh my goodne
ss, this gives me...I don't remember it 

so...(pause)...anyway uh the way how they did it convinced me  that...until then I was not 

really convinced that people were uh gassed. We heard about it. There were rumors but 

nobody knew for sure. It really didn't ma ke sense. The whole plan of th
e annihilation of the 
Jews was conceived in such a diabolic way...ha
ving a Jewish Judenrat to collaborate, to 
fulfill the orders of the Germans because they had no way, no different way, no way out. 

Having installed the Jewish police and here is 
an element which I would like to mention. To 
a large degree the Jewish police was formed by former lawyers. They were so brutal. Their 

language was so crude. The way...how they uh how
 they behaved toward the population was 
so revolting that many times we asked ourselves, how come these educated people...and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
8
 
 
they...you had to consider them educated people to
 a large degree in comparison to the other 
people in the ghetto who who were not educat
ed, who didn't have any university schooling. 
It uh behaved in such a way...the circumstances created it. Example. During the summer of 
'42, seeing that I really had nobody to rely on...I
'm a stranger...I'm a foreigner...who is going 
to help me?   I had...we had no money. I starte
d to explore the area around Korulovka. In one 
of these explorations I got into another ghetto 
by the name  of Czortkow (ph). It was a bigger 
ghetto. It had five thousand Jews there and the 
leader, the Judenaltester, was a lawyer by the 
name  of Dr. Ebner (ph). You know in the ol
d Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, every lawyer 
was called Herr doctor. I wanted what they ca
lled a psheapuska (ph). Pshepuska in Polish 
means a passirchein (ph), a permit, because I 
wanted to ma ke my way or to find a way 
toward the border. The border was Zaleszcz
yki. It uh...when I uh sent a militia man in 
ann...to say if Dr. Ebner can receive me , I don'
t know what the militia if he understood very 
well, but I ended up really in front of Dr. 
Ebner who said, who are you?   What do you want?  
Very hostile. I said, look. I'm a physician 
from Czernowitz, you know, Czernowitz. As a 

matter of fact I was trying to...Czernowitz had 
a a deputy by the name  of Meyer Ebner...I 
say...the same last name...I said you probably must
 be related. He said, sure I'm related. What 
do you want?   His attitude was...he called the 
militia man in and told him in Polish uh 
Czortkow. That means search him. I didn't know 
what...and he said uh see if he had, if he has 
grini papirna (ph). That means dollars. I didn't have any. He says what do you want?   I say I 

would like a _____, a pshapuska (ph). He sai
d, look doctor. I have no time. You are 

bothering me. You take my time away. I have...I 
have my people to take care of. Get out of 
my ghetto or I'll give you over to the Gestapo myself. I was really amazed at that hostile 

reaction and I was very depressed. I left that 
ghetto because he said in ten mi nutes you have 
to disappear from my ghetto. Alright. Czortkow 
was a city which looked or is a city which 
looked like a fortress. It had bi
g uh tall uh uh walls. It was one of the eastern cities of the old 
Austrian-Hungarian monarchy and probably for pr
otection against invasions from the east, 
but it was a a frightening city. I 
left the city in a hurry. I was disappointed. I was angry. I was 
hungry, tired, and I came and throwing me out 
of the ghetto, Dr. Ebner saved my life. 
Outside the ghetto, I was exhausted. I looked 
for a place, a _____, and I fell asleep. Until in 
the morning I heard uh I heard engine uh noise
. I looked out and I saw trucks filled with 
police, German police, Ukrainian police. They
 were liquidating the ghetto in that day. By 
throwing me  out of the ghetto, he had uh really 
saved my life. To ma ke a long story short uh 
at the end of September, beginning of Oct
ober, finally the aktion took place in _______. It 
was preceded by a request from the Gestapo to
 Max Glickstern, the Judenrateltester, to 
furnish two hundred fifty Jews. The rumors said
 that the two hundred fifty Jews were me ant 
to go for schmeltz (ph) what that means ? . That means for destruction. And I happened to 

witness a discussion in the Judenrat which t
ook place to form a list 
of the two hundred and 
fifty Jews, and it it was a...the
 discussion which took place...he said look, you have an old uh 
father up there who is really...why don't you give 
your father. He said my father. You have 
an uncle and you have this...why don't you gi
ve...and everybody was pointing fingers to 
somebody else. It came to a point where Max G
lickstern, he had to really...and I I admi red 

him in that time...had tears in his eyes a
nd said look, fellows. I grew up, I know everyone 
of...I grew up in this community. I know every one of you here. I am not going to ma ke a list

of two hundred and fifty Jews. I am going to sa
y to the community hide. Whomever it will, it 
will hit it will hit but I'm not going to make. And he left the meeting. So now everybody was 
finishing or starting to to to uh because ever
ybody knew it is it is...the end is near and uh the 
result of that aktion was really disastrous. It
 wasn't  two hundred and fifty. It ended up around 
fourteen hundred were taken and it explains to 
a large degree what has been discussed so 
many times in the last years. Was it correct or was it right or was it fair fr om the Judenrat or 

the Judeneltester...I just read the book about 
Rumkovski, the chief of the Lodz ghetto, you 
know, to give out in order to save the co
mmunity a certain number of Jews. Here Max 
Glickstein had re...had refused to give out two 
hundred fifty and later we asked ourselves the 
question...if he would have given the two 
hundred and fifty, you know, there would have 
remained uh fourteen hundred still there. But 
it was a a a question which nobody really could 
uh answer satisfactorily. Uh some  two hundr
ed, hundred eighty or two hundred Jews who 
whose hiding place were not f
ound, were uh were uh survived. I witnessed one scene where 
a uh a tailor by the name  of Singer whom 
I had known in the ghetto uh was on his knee 
before a German and said, herr Gestapo, ________________. He looked at him... 
 

Q: Translatethat. 

 

A: ...uh Mr. Gestapo. Give me  back
 my wife and my child, to which the ma n looked at him and 
said bring me  a thousand Juden. Bring me  t
housand Jews. And then he brought a thousand 
Jews. He knew the hiding place of every...of a 
lot of people. I'll tell you why. Many people, 
especially the one who had uh still money...they'
re paying people to to to dig their bunkers. 
In this way there were people who knew about
 the bunker of neighbors or other people, and 
he brought them. When I, we left the ghetto, 
Gusti and I...Gusti was the name  of my first 
wife...uh Mr. Singer was was still there and the Germans had...he had his wife and his child. 

How long he survived I don't know. Uh summe r 19...before the aktion took place, an 

incident...an even...a a an episode which mi ght be
 interesting. One day I got in...I think it was 
July or August '42...I don't remember exactly...I 
get a call from the, from Dr. Teibers to 
come, to come to him. Since I have seen uh 
in the end of 1941 he hadn't uh shown too much 
interest in me. And I came there.
 I I was a little suspicious of his call and I said uh...he starts 
questioning...how hungry are you doctor?   I was impre
ssion first he ma ke fun of me , but then 
I thought...I say why do you ask me  that question?
  Sure. We have no food. He said I'll tell 
you why. There is a community around Korolovka 
by the name  of Oxenetz. The story of 
Oxenetz, O - X - E - N - E - T 
- Z, it is a a a uh...how do they called it....it would be called a a 
uh hotbed of Ukrainian nationalism. Why is it im
portant to mention it?  In Oxenetz, they 
were around twenty or twenty-five Jewish fam
ilies. Before the German authorities or the 
Ukrainian authorities were able to take over the new admi nistration after the Soviets left , the 

local popu...uh population, the local Ukrainians had k
illed all the Jewish families in Oxenetz. 
He said there is a call to be made, a medical call in Oxenetz for the grandchild of the wogt 

(ph). Wogt is the Polish name  or the Ukrainian name for uh the ma yor. The word comes 

from the German vogt. It is a uh a Ukrainiani
zation of it, colonization of the word. The 
_____, and he'll pay whatever...there is no docto
r in the whole place. I say why don't you 
take the call?  He said I wouldn't even if th
ey would pay uh gold I wouldn't go there. He says 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021

these are murderers. Well, he said, there is
 a man outside the ghetto who waits with a 
carriage or the _____, you know, to take whoever
...if you want to go. He'll pay you whatever 
you want. I went back and I told Gusti this w
ill be the only way to get some food. I didn't tell 
her that it is to Oxenetz because why should...s
he heard later while I was away. I knew that 
in the area was an epidemic of diphtheria and 
when I came out the...the outside the ghetto, I 
found a militia, a Ukrainian militia man with the ca
p of where they have the emblem of the 
Ukrainian uh organization. The Ukrainian Nationalist organization had the, was OUM, for 
uh Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Organizationa Ukreinski Nationalistiv (ph) in 

Ukrainian, and their militia men had an embl
em...they call it the trizub (ph). Trizub is a 
trident . It looked like a trident and they have 
it on top of their cap. He had a trident thing and 
he had a I thought it was a fris
ky horse. There were two uh wheels in the front, two in the 

back and something...and we had to sit sideways on it because there was no...there were no 

sides walls on it. Anyway I said before we 
leave I would like to pass by a...what we called 
the convent. There were two Polish nuns 
who uh who provided the population with uh 
sporadically this drugs, medications and I 
passed by...I knew the nuns because one of the 
nuns a throat infection. Being an ear, nose and th
roat man, Dr. Teibers a year before had told 
me, had sent me there to see them because the nuns, you had to to to treat for free and Dr. 

Teibers was not very much interested to treat
 for free and this was the reason why he was 
called over _______. Anyway I...they gave me  a serum, two ampules of serum I think 

around ten cc's each, large ampules, and uh whose da
te of expiration was...as a matter of fact 
I don't remember it...there was a date of e
xpiration. I took these two ampules and we not 
knowing if I'm going to use it. We ...after four, 
five hours we arrived in Oxenetz and entering 
I saw empty houses that the wind was was 
was uh uh...the empty wi
ndows without glass 
panes were uh uh and he shout...the ma n shouted 
and said in Ukrainian to me...used a  very 
derogatory word. He says ___________________. Here 
our Jews lived. Our Jews. But he 
used the term jide (ph). It is a a term which th
e Ukrainian applied in general to Jews and uh I 
came to the house of the wogt. He greeted me  
in this way, with the hand up. Not the uh the 
uh...it was a greeting...I don't don't think it was the 
Nazi's Nazi...and showed me  the way into 
the house. I came in. I found a tw
o and a half or three year old boy breathing very heavily, 
almost uh, you know... ______, ______, he had that 
_______ ...I looked in his throat and 
there was no (cough) uh everybody who had seen once the so-called pseudo-me mbranes of 

of diphtheria patients, it was no problem for me to make the diagnosis. I told the ____ I have 

to to uh give him an injection. He said you 
do what you have to do. The only thing is there 
were some fifteen, sixteen people in that little
 room, you know, the the air was heavy. I said I 
want everybody out, so only four or five peopl
e remained. There was a grandmother. Uh I 
found out that this was the only male grandchild
 of the wogt and he he he was tremendously 

uh uh eager and concerned about the health. I ga
ve the child...the child was very toxic. His 
his temperature was low. He didn't even have
 a high temperature. He was pale. He had 
trouble breathing. I checked his heart to see if 
he had any complications. No. His heartbeat 
was alright. His lungs uh I couldn't make out because of that ________ but I gave him the 

injection and uh I said we'll see. He said alri
ght. You see, you're going to sleep in the next 
room. I said what do you mean sleep in the ne
xt room. He says well, you're going to stay 
here until the child will recover. I had...I was 
under the impression that this is going to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
11
 
 
just a medical call and I will leave. I realized immediately if that if that child is not going to 
recover I don't think I'll recover or I'll survive 
it. But to make a long story short, I was hungry 
so I said look, I didn't eat the whole day. O
h, he said, food...no problem. He called his wife. 
He said why don't you ma ke the doctor...and he sa
id pane doctor. That means herr doctor. So 
I uh said make me a a uh uh five eggs, this slan
ina, this bacon and they put a bottle of vodka. 
I had three drinks. I ate it. I felt good and I 
fell asleep. When I woke up uh some  ten or 
twelve hours later and now it was morning, next da
y, ten o'clock. I went in to see my patient. 
He was breathing slightly better. He still still 
had some  ________ but we were able to force a 
little water or cold milk in his throat. I uh di
dn't know, I didn't have what to do so meantime 
somebody else came and said doctor, could you see 
my wife. So my fee in that time was two 
chickens for a cold, so I asked 
the wogt if he'd give me  permission. He said sure, why not. 
Anyway in the evening, at the end of the sec
ond day I I was a a lucky uh uh proprietor of six 
chickens. I had three. I slept the second. I ate 
and drank well and the third day they...the child 
was breathing now much better. It was...it...t
he the serum had...I was very worried. The 
serum at that time was not a very concentrated 
serum and uh there were a lot of reactions, the 
reaction what we called serum disease. It...you c
ould have really serious uh uh side reaction, 

sometimes even fatal. Anyway, that child had 
absolutely no no side effects. He recovered. 
The fourth day he was fine. He asked fo
r food. He had now a little
 bit of a...still around 
hundred, hundred and two, being that, you know, th
e European thermometers were from 
thirty-six degrees Celsius so...centigrade...s
o uh I said, I asked the wogt how do you uh...do 
you think I could leave. He says oh yes. Ne
ver said thank you. The only uh person who came 

forward was the wife, his wife. Not the mother 
of the...the mother of the child didn't leave 
the child but the grandmother, the wife of th
e wogt. She came out, took my hand and said in 
Ukrainian, doctor, thank you very much. You 
are a good ma n. You saved my grandchild and 
the wogt said, the car...here is the ma
n who brought you. I said...oops, I'm sorry...he 
said...I'm sorry ______...he uh said uh...I had asked for what they call a koretz (ph) 

of..._____ is hundred kilo, two hundred pounds of uh 
wheat, kernels. He said no problem. I 
found the hundred kilos on the carriage...on the br
iska. Meantime I had twelve chickens. The 
moth...the grandmother of, the wife of the wogt 
had told me  she's going to take care of and 
really everything was on the carriage and I as
ked the man when he finally arrived at 

Korulovka at the ghetto...this was ______. That 
means the aktion...I am I am comi ng back. 
Aktion had not taken place yet. In no time 
the whole ghetto, you know, uh knew that the 
Romanian doctor is with a whole...meantime 
the rumor that I am bringing a tremendous 
amount of kernels back. To ma ke a long story 
short, we had wheat only twenty kilos, not 
twenty I don't know. Twenty pounds of that kernels 
we were able to turn into into flour and 
to bake it. The rest got lost during the insp
ection of a uh agricultural, German agricultural 
inspectors. They inspected the ghetto and this was really to to get the food out of the ghetto.

I had decided to form for myself a boivka

woma n and her husband by the name  of Padover. Why did I...it was an energetic woma n in 

her late thirties or beginning forties who was, 
who grew up in the area. She knew every area 
in the...and when she talked to me about it, I 
knew that she really was very familiar with it. 
She had, she had uh uh contacts with farmers.
 She knew farmers. She had contact with 
farmers who were uh her friends from before and I felt it was a good...she introduced me  also

to a very tall, six foot two, young, eighteen year
 old Jewish fellow whom I recruited also 
because they were survivors of what had happe
ned in the ghetto and I had decided to go into 
the woods. Uh to ma ke a long story short, when
 we met in the woods at our hiding place, it 
turned out to be a complete fiasco. Mr. Padover had decided meantime...he showed up at our 

meeting place with an eighteen year old kid. I 
said where is your wife, because the reason 
why I had recruited him was his wife, not he. 
And he said ah she's too old for me . The young 
ma n who had said he's going to bring a brothe
r brought a fourteen y
ear old kid...thin...I don't 
know if he was uh ma ybe ninety-fiv
e pounds...thin...you know, every uh wind uh draft 
would would...my whole fighting group turned 
out to be really nothing. Anyway we 
found...we had ma de an appointme nt with the 
Ukrainian fellow who took us to a place uh 
where he fed us really and uh hid us and two week
s or ten days later, there was an alarm. We 
had to run. During running there was panic. We  
ran in different directions. We lost each 
other and Gusti and I ended up together out 
in the woods. Meantime it was cold. We didn't 
have where to go. I'm remi nded now the promis
e which Mr. Zarevski, the husband that Pole 
had told me ...it took me  one and a haLf days to
 get. He was in a little town...I think Smikow 
(ph), I don't remember exactly. He lived in a 
hut outside...I knew where he lived because he 
had brought me to see his wife th
ere and uh was hard to get there. It was outside...he he tried 

to keep a very low profile, being Polish and 
I...then later I understood why. Because it turned 
out he was a me mber of the underground, 
the Polish underground. When I knocked on his 
window it must have been four o'clock in 
the morning. Uh I heard some body moving inside. 
Finally he opened and then I told through th
e window who it is. I uh...he opened and let us 
in. We  were exhausted. He gave us some  food. 
He let us sleep there and then he said, look, 
uh uh this is a bad place for you to stay. I di
dn't understand why. To me it looked like a very 
good place. But he said this is...I have to find a hiding place for you. A week later or six days 

later, he said I found some body. He took us on a 
tour which lasted probably three hours, way 
into the woods, and he, on the way there, he 
said the furster (ph)...furster is a a uh uh 
Polanization or Ukrainization of the German
 word ______. It means a 
ma n who takes care of 
the woods, of uh uh...he's a representative of the 
of the county, in the woods. He sort of uh 
uh surveys the cutting of trees wh
ere they ma...where they collect wood for the winter. He he 
uh sells or gives the wood out to certain peopl
e in certain communities. He's an official 

person. We met him there and he again sai
d...we came there. The first thing we ate 
something after these three and a half hours of
 walk and uh he was very respectful toward 
Mr. Zaresvki, as if he would be his superi
or. I didn't understand why. Whatever he...and that 
he knew about us already and he said yes, 
I have a place for you, but not here where he 
lived...he he was with his wife there. He wa
s a rep...he spoke Polish with Mr. Zarevski. He 

had certain loyalties toward the previous admi nistration because he was the official 

representative of the Polish uh community there. 
He was an employee of the State, not of the 
county, and...but he was very respectful toward Mr
. Zarevski, and they brought us to a barn 
some  four kilome ters far in the woods, an em
pty building - hay with an at...so-called attic, 
you know, and uh we...in the attic there was so
me thing which looked like a bed as if 
some body had slept. I understood why he brought 
us there. That me ans if  some body would 
find out that Jews are there, he could say he
 didn't know anything about it. He said he will 
visit us every week. He gave us a couple of
 uh blankets and he gave us some  food. ______

he said he's going once a week to visit us, 
night time, and really uh it happened. For three 
weeks he came every week, brought us f
ood. One day I saw around six o'clock...it was 
already slightly dark...two figures comi ng. It
 turned out to be Zarevski and Janek. _______ 
was the name  of the person, and uh uh uh Zarevski
 or Zaremski, said I want to talk to you 

personally. My wife...so _______, the first thing, 
my wife uh sepa...stayed aside and he 
talked to me , he said to me  uh, you know, you 
come from Romania, right?   How well do you 
speak Romanian?   I said perfect, I said. He 
said well, do you think you would like to join a 
fighting organization?   Join a fighting...?   Cert
ainly, why not. Which is it?   He said it's out 
near Armi a Kraiowa. We are under the the 
uh governme nt of the in the, the Polish 

government. He said I'll come in a week back. I 
am going to discuss with my superiors. I told 
him about you, and I gave...I have a plan. He sa
ys I'm not going to talk to you yet about my 
plan. He came back uh came back the next week
 and said, well, my plan seems to be a good 
one. It still has to be approved by the Center (
ph). My next question was, if I join you, will I 
be armed?   He said everybody in this orga
nization has a gun. _____. He said I trust you. Uh 
then he left. He walked some  three, four hundr
ed feet, then he turned around and came back, 

took out a pistol, a German luge
r, and said here, you have this. Keep it. It had a full mag...I 
checked...it had a full magazine. It was a 
9 milimeter. They called it the German 
Parabellum______. It was a a uh a fine gun with 
a long. Anyway, he came back a week later 
and he said, look, uh...oh yes, meantime we
 were...it was December, beginning of 
January...we were '42-'43. The...apparently the fu
rster had a radio because he heard BBC. He 
told us about the Battle of Stalingrad which 
takes place and the Russians are beating the hell 
out of of the Germans and the Germans...in th
at time he said, he told me about Marshall 
Paulus who wants to uh to uh to...was picked 
up by by BBC. He he gets, asks the permission 
of Hitler to to uh to give up and Hitler says
 no, until the last man so our mood was...right 
now I was going to be a me mber of a fighting organization. I had a gun. You don't know 

what a gun in that time meant for a Jew. To ha
ve a gun, to be able to protect yourself. You 
couldn't...it it was worth its own weight in
 gold and here I got
 it without...I had you 
know...and the news about the Battle of St
alingrad...it was good news. Our morale 
was...anyway it didn't last for a long time. Now...he
 told me now about his plan. He said I'm 
going to be a courier for them (ph). He said
 the contacts of the army of _____ takes place 

only through Sweden and it is very hard because 
they have to go to Gdansk, from Gdansk to 
smuggle, to...by boat, to Sweden and from ther
e to...and from Sweden they have no problem 
getting to England but because the Polish governme
nt in exile is direct organization from 

England and the contacts through through Swed
en is bad. He still is waiting but his 
immediate superior in Lamberg (ph), in in...had said it's a wonderful idea. He should take me 

in so...and I speaking Romanian because Romani
a had a large group of refugees from Poland 
who had run away, military people, civilians, and there was an active Polish organization 

direct in charge of the Polish refugees in
 Roma nia. That means he had a a good in for 
Roma nia to get in touch with with England wa
s much easier. Uh Romania at that time had 
contacts with Turkey and through Turkey they 
could they could get...so he felt I was the 
ideal uh person to make the contact. It...a week later with _____ the furster came also. 

Almost two weeks later...it was the beginning I th
ink of February or the end of February and 
he came back in panic. You have to leav
e immediately. Next day a Ukrainian police

is...militia is comi ng there. He doesn't  know w
hy they are comi ng but he heard one militia 
ma n who had a a Polish mother, you know, who 
had still...had told him about it, and uh 
apparently also uh ____ was on the run. Some th
ing had happened. He didn't tell me what 
and I have to give him back the gun. I thought th
at the whole thing is...he's going to bring me 
to some body else he had spoke. He brought me
...we walked, we walked I think the whole 
night. I think he couldn't have brought us fa
rther to a place which looked very good for me, 
for...uh to me. It was...it's a hiding place under a 
stable. Unfortunately, that stable had...the 
floor of the stable were boards and the board
s had spaces between them, small spaces. There 
was a cow there, and when the weather was bad 
the cow didn't want to go out or wasn't  taken 
outside, so when the cow had to urinate or to 
defecate there, especially to urinate, it came 
down like a, like a shower and you had to r
un to the side. Still you ended up getting some 
sprinkles of that urine and that urine had a 
smell and it impregnated what our clothes and 
after two or three weeks, it
...we start to smell badly. You know, we hated ourselves. As a 
matter of fact a few weeks later Gusti broke out
 in general furuncolosys , furunculs uh small 

infections of the skin. She was so depressed. It
 hurt. She couldn't scratch it. It was itchy. It 
was infected. It took me  probably...slowly, sl
owly by treating each infection infection 
separately, to clean it up, it took maybe two months. Meantime you had to go out night time 

and you couldn't get out night and every night to 
to uh to try to get rid, to take off the the 
clothes and you couldn't...and it was cold...you couldn'
t take off the clothes. You were cold. 
But you have still to air these clothes in order th
ey should get dry to loose, because we ended 
up smelling terrible. Uh two months...it had 
one good thing. We  had a built-in supply of 

milk. I learned to milk the cow. I had to be 
careful because whenever she milked the cow, 
she gave us half a cup of milk each, but 
it wasn't  enough, so I learned to try...Gusti was 
holding the cow and stroking her neck which the cow really liked very much and she got 

accustomed to Gusti stroking and I was milking 
her. In the beginning I tried...I didn't have a 

receptacle, you know, so I was trying to dr
ink directly. You know, when you are hungry you 
do many things. But this was the built-in uh m
ilk supply of that hiding place. The couple 
were under apparently Pole-friendly, Polish uh 
friendly to the Poles because the Furster 
never showed up again. I don't really know what 
had happened to him. Neither Zarevski nor 
the Polish Furster. They had brought us, but th
ey were friendly to a degree. The husband was 
Ukrainian. The wife was a mi xture of Polish. She spoke well Polish...Maria...no...Anka (ph) 

was her name. Anka had...Gusti told her in order to
 give her...that she's a fine knitter. She's a 
good knitter. She saw her wearing an old pull-
over she has. You know...let me  have that 
pull-over. I'm going to take it apart. I'm going 
to wash the wool and knit for you a new one. 
She made her a new pull-over in three, two or three days and she was, Anka was delighted 

and she started to bring her more and more. 
Apparently she made it a business because she 
sold it for something or she exchanged it. She 
bartered it because uh Gusti was a very fast 
knitter. She was able to finish a pull-over in 
one and a half days working eight to ten hours 
and there was nothing else to do. You know, we 
could go out only in the...and so it happens 
that in the spring or April or May, walking around by myself to air, to get a little fresh air 

and to get rid of that smell, that I happened and probably having strayed a little too far 

because I had strayed once too far and I got n
ear a house and a dog started to bark. In small 
communities if one dog starts to bark, all the 
dogs in the whole community...and I started to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
16
 
 
run away because I had ma ybe fifty or 
sixty dogs start a whole...you know, naturally 
immediately their owners will come out to 
investigate what's going on, so this was bad 
because we could be found out a
nd uh uh the stricter interdiction by our hosts were not to go 
too far, to stay...and I had impression while I wa
lked...this must have been in April...it was 
already, or May uh that uh...oh yes...meantime becau
se of that knitting business, the attitude 
of our hosts had had started to improve. It wa
s only bad when they got drunk or had a fight, 
and usually then they uh then they had uh...the
y drank and they got a little high. They started 
to have a fight. It had to do with Polish-Ukrainian or I don't know because I didn't hear but 

there were times when he hit her and then 
she was yelling, but these were not good uh omens 
for us because uh if some body would have found 
out that he was hiding Jews, he would, he 
could have been shot. Anyway, comi ng b
ack, walking outside, I had the impression 
some body is following me , and I went in circles,
 walking a little farther than usually, and I 
heard uh...really I was sure now some body followed me  because I heard...he must have 

stepped on on a on dry branches. I heard them
 uh the noise of uh branches until fi nally 
some body told me  from behind, hands up, 
_______, and...in Russian, and went through my 
pockets. I had a knife with me . They took my
 knife away and...he took my knife and not 
they. He took my knife away. Told me  to 
lie down with my face down and started to 
inter...who I am and so I told him look, 
uh Romanian...now I told immediately I'm a 
Romanian physician, you know, and he said uh...he used the term evrei (ph) Evrei (ph) is a 

Russian term for Jews, but not derogatory. Uh it uh it means you are a Jew, but it's not a 

derogatory term. It's uh it's the way how in th
eir, in the Russian passports you are being uh 
uh indicate your nationality. He wanted to know with who I am, where I am, how long I 

have been there, how uh...well, he said, uh I want
 to see...in next week I'm going to be here. I 
saw immediately he doesn't  belong to the lo
cal Ukraine. I was afraid he mi ght be a 

Banderovtzi (ph) fr om the Ukrainian uh orga
nization which killed Jews. He was not. He 
didn't have the trizub. He uh he uh he had 
a a German uh uh sub-machine gun, a Schmeisser 
and uh didn't tell me...I asked him...he didn't answer
. He says I would like to talk to, to see 

your wife. I want to see if it's correct. Alright. A 
week later or ten days later..we had made an 
appointment. I brought Gusti there. What coul
d I do. Yes, he said, no word to your house 
about me. I don't trust them. I don't know them
. No word. And I came the uh first thing, 
when I came with Gusti to meet him, also night 
time, he looked at her, as much as he could 
see her in the dark. He said do you follow my or
ders. I didn't know what he meant. I said not 

to tell your host anything...orders, he said. So it was a military term, you know, and I didn't 

know...now he told us who he was. He said his na
me was Vasia. He is a part of an organ....of 

a parachute group which were uh parachuted n
ear Tarnopol and they have to prepare the 

terrain for a large group. He said...I said how large. He said close to a thousand people. A 

thousand people parachuting... didn't sound to me
 very, very uh...yes he said. He me ntioned 

a General Kovpak, K - O - V - P -A - K. He's  
their leader and he will come with the big 
group. He has to, orders to prepare and he says they have to fulfill an order, he says, but 

nobody in our...only a few people know our task, what
 we have to perform. Later I found out 
the whole group is supposed to destroy the indus
trial triangle in northwestern Galitzia , three 
________ in Borsczow. There were mi nes. Ther
e were oil, you know, and two weeks later 
he came. He was very short. Yes. At our 
meeting when he me t Gusti, as a sign of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
17
 
 
friendliness he brought us a kolbasa. Kolbasa is 
the Russian term for salami , for kilbasi (ph), 
you know, and he brought a piece of bread and 
uh...terrific delicacy for us. The second time 
when he came he brought us some  uh salted uh 
lard. Salted lard was one of the preferred 
things for us, because if you spread...a little pi
ece would keep you the whole...it was rich in 
calories. It could keep you a whole day, 
you know, your stomach. Again he inter...I 
started...now again he says, do you speak Roma nian?   No, this was later. A week later he 
asked me  this. The week later he came. He was very de...it was now July. July '43. He said 

we had fulfilled our task. The large group had 
arrived. We had destroyed...the triangle went 
up in flame. I don't know how muc
h. I can rely only what uh he told me , and he said uh...the 
second time when he he had asked me  again uh 
would you like to join our group, I said sure, 
why not. _____, what did I have. Uh, but he had to
ld me he doesn't  like our hiding place. He 
has to find for us another hiding place and he
 really did. He found 
for us a hiding place 
again. It was a Ukrainian couple who apparently
 were very pro-Soviet and very...apparently 
who were not very well regarded by the Ukrain
ian Nationalist Organization because of some 
job they had had during the occupation of Gala
tia by the Russians, and apparently he was a 
contact of theirs and so on. Meantime...as 
soon...why, when I asked him why do you look so 
uh shattered, he said, oh we fought very hard. The Germans attacked us. As soon as they 

destroyed that triangle, the Germans brought a 
whole division, I think of Ukrainian SS. The 
Ukrainian formed I think two SS divisions and 
uh he says they destroyed everything. As a 
matter of fact he says our group is now in th
e mountains, in the Carpetian (ph) mountains. 
They pushed us back and the higher and higher 
we go...and he says and I have a task for you. 
Yes...meantime he had brought me also a 
gun. He had brought me  a gun...a big twelve 
shooter. A Belgium FN. He called it FN enca (
ph). FN stands for Fabrique  Nationale, 
because I could read the inscription on this. It's
 a big gun. It has...it's a nine millimeter gun. It 
has a big uh twelve uh bullet magazine. It 
pulled my pants down, (laughter) you know, but a 

gun was some thing which uh...uh so by August he came back to us. Yes...we were me antime 

transferred to that couple. Again, we were in a barn, a much smaller but there was no...(long 

pause/blank in tape)...didn't have any more of
 that uh that uh uh contact with the nipping, 
with Anka, the previous hostess and uh they sai
d...one day he came, he said next day I have 
your...meantime he had inquired about Romania,
 how well I know the northern part of 
Bukovina and so on and he said I'm going to be 
a courier to a person who is in Romania, in 
the northern part of Bukovina. He gave me  th
e name . The name  was, I think, Petre Hreniuk. 
Petre Hreniuk. H - R - E - N - I 
- U - K. Petre Hreniuk lived near the Zastavna (ph). Now my 
sister was the uh in charge of a pharmacy in 
Zastavna and I knew the area. I had...I knew the 
area from Czernowitz, how to travel to Za
stavna, but I never had done from _____ and 

Zastavna was not far from from uh the bor
der. All those parts...you could reach it by uh 
walking. He said you have to meet Petre Hreni
uk and uh try to to uh...he 
should hide fifty of 
our fighters. I said alright. You have to leav
e tomorrow. He told the couple, the woma n of 
the...uh he went to the woma n. She came over and he said you have to prepare for me  uh 

food I should take from, for a week, ten days. 
He felt, he figured out...took me  much longer 
because I did the biggest stupidity of my lif
e while I was ______. It was...he told that he 
is...the woma n knew the area and she gave me  a 
contact where I could...I had to uh to cross 
the Dniester. The Dniester is the border betw
een...the river Dniester is the border between 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
18
 
 
Poland and uh the General Government in th
e northern part of Bukovina. Meantime the 
Bukovina had nearly occupied by the Roma nian and was a Roma nian admi nistration there. 
I...there...the crossing of the Dniester was 
no problem. It was a dr
ought. The Niestra was 
very uh very uh shallow and I am a swimmer. I...so it didn't uh affect. I came to Petre 

Hreniuk who...uh when I gave him uh...there was 
a uh a...I had to tell him who sent me, 
everything. Finally he he knew about it. I thi
nk somebody else mi ght have told him because 
he knew about the group. The group had had uh uh 
parachuted near Tarnapol (ph), between 
Tarnapol and Chotkow (ph) near 
Skalat (ph). They had first, while they had parachuted they 
had immediately a a uh a run-in with the 
Ukrainian police which brought Germans from 
Borszczow, from Czortkow and from from uh 
________, to help them fight. And this is how 

the...but they they proceeded slowly, slowly toward _______ which that triangle and finally 

they destroyed it. But meantime all the way they had to fi ght the Germans and the 

Ukrainians. It uh...I wanted to tell you somethi
ng else. Yes...in that time before I left, uh 
Vasia  had told me  that the group which had 
parachuted had formed a Jewish echelon. They 
called it I think Third (ph) Echelon, formed by 
Jewish refugees whom they had picked up. 
But he said you are not going to to join them
. You will have a special task. You'll be a 
courier. Here I was again...uh uh uh engaged to be a courier by a different group uh similar 

to do almost a similar task like for the 
Polish uh underground. They...I came to Hreniuk. 
Hreniuk when I told him fifty people he laughed. 
He said uh it, it's impossible. He said the 
only thing what I could hide, the only people,
 five...maybe six peopl
e. He says...how should 
I feed them. They...uh in...not far from him 
there was a little town where ___ Romanian 
gendarmerie post. He says you cannot hide fi
fty people easily in this here. You you need 
food. You know these are fifty human beings
 who who eat, drink. If you...he says five 
people I could make. While I was there eating and drinking...he he served me food and really 

he was very friendly. Uh the only thing is this is what he can do. Not more. Suddenly it came 

in my mi nd...here I am not far from Czernowitz
. Why can't  I go to Czernowitz?    I forgot 
completely, and I I grew up there. That there 
is the River Prut which...who has a bridge over 
it which, when you come  from the north...I have
 completely forgotten. And I decided to go 
on a Sunday to Czernowitz knowing that the 
market in Czernowitz takes place on Monday 
always. And there will be farmers who go to 
ma rket. Suddenly I...on the road I pick....I was 
picked, I picked up a couple who were on a 
little...who were taking food to Czernowitz to 
see at the market and they gave me a ride and I was sitting with them, talking with them. It 

was early...four, five o'clock in 
the morning and suddenly we arrived at the bridge and at the 

bridge there were Romanian uh soldiers. It was 
not the...the real bridge had been destroyed 
and there was a pontoon bridge. I c
ouldn't go back anymore. I had told this couple that I have 
an appointment with the school uh revisor in 
Czernowitz. I looked like a farmer but I spoke 
quite a Romanian and uh these were Ukrain
ian uh farmers, Ruthenians, and they...the 
soldiers didn't ask any questions. They...he asked the farmer in the...who was sitting in the 

front with uh guiding the horses...he said uh, ma
rket?   He said, yeah. He let us pass. 
Anyway, I I was ready to uh to to collapse uhso emotional. Anyway
 I found myself on the 
other side. I went, knowing Czernowitz quite 
well, I went through side...uh you have to go 
uh uh _____ street, Banhofstrasse which is a very
 uh steep uh street that the tramway goes 
up toward the  center of the city. I'm in side 
street, Morariu strasse, and I came to my street 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
19
 
 
where I was born and to tell you the truth, when I saw the house, Marshall Fosh number 9, I I 
looked at it. I looked at it and yes...and on the 
way there I had seen a few people with the 

Juden star (ph). They didn't have what we ha
d in Poland, that uh uh white band with the blue 
star. They had the yellow star here and uh I tried 
to pass, uh to keep a low profile as much as 
possible. While I was in my street I saw comi ng 
a former girlfriend of mi ne with a Roma nian 
officer, arm in arm, and uh didn't even uh spent 
one look at me. I was dressed like a farmer. I 
recognized her. She didn't even look at me a
nd then I decided I did enough stupidity comi ng 
in to the city and uh I still have to go back and...oh yes...what was very important, Vasia had 

told me  my wife is going to stay in Poland. 
He said it's the...if I let Gusti go with you you'll 
never come back and he was right. And yes...I 
had to leave my gun there. He said you cannot 
take the gun of course. It mi ght uh, it mi ght indu
ce you to be, to start a fight or something not 
good. Better if you don't have a gun. And he was probably right. 
 

Q: Were your parents still alive at that time? 

 

A: No. My father and my sister, I found out 
later that they, you know, generally from the 
community of around a hundred thousand Jews, 
around eighty-five thousand were deported 
to Transnistria Moghilev and the centers 
in Transnistia. The area uh uh...Hitler gave the 
Romanian an area beyond the Dniester between th
e Dniester  and the Bugr rivers, which the 
Romanians called Transnistria, where hey 
deported a few hundred thousand Jews and uh 
from Czernowitz they took eighty-five thousand.My sister was declared uh...eight uh fifteen 

thousand Jews rema ined in Czernowitz which 
were declared uh important for the economy 
of the city, as a former (ph) city, and she got
 a permit to remain in the city. She remained 
with my father. I didn't know who lived in 
the house. I didn't dare to go in not knowing 
who...it happens that my father and Melane (ph) 
stayed in that house where I was in front of 
that house looking at it. I didn't realize it. I di
dn't ask anybody. I tried to to to to sneak by and 
finally decided...oh yes...I had asked the, that 
couple with the horse who had brought me to 
Czernowitz when they returned and they said  ah between two and three o'clock. I said do 

you have...but he said we have no 
watch. Neither did I. So I figured out more or less...I went 
back to what the Prut, toward the river where I fell asleep for a couple of hours because 

meantime it was only ten o'clock, and around twelve 
o'clock or twelve thirty I was back at 
the place where we had decided where we meet
. They were already there waiting. They had 
sold what they had to sell, and they were wa
it...they were ready to leave even without me, 
but since I came earlier I still found them. 
We  crossed the pontoon bridge again. Nobody 
asked any questions, and I...when I came back 
to north toward the border I decided to go 
back to Hreniuk and to rest a little bit for a day, which I did, and this time he was quite 

hostile. He wasn't  very...he said what are you 
doing here?  I told him I was in Czernowitz 
and he said you went to Czernowitz?   Aren't  
you afraid?   I didn't te
ll him how stupid I was 
doing it, but uh I couldn't resist. I had comple
tely...it was an emotional reaction which I 
couldn't explain. Comi ng back to Poland I uh 
told him...I found him in terrible shape, 
terrible. He had a wound on his his...two feet...he
 had walked probably a lot. He said he's 
trying to ma ke...he came to say goodbye to us. He 
left me  the gun. He told me  the order of 
the day, of General Kovpak is every soldier got 
fifty bullets. He says since I had a Belgium 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
20
 
 
gun, they didn't have...I got only what was in
 the ma gazine. He says you have twelve. 
Remember - the order of the day is forty-ni
ne bullets for the Germans, one for yourself. 
Don't give up. That means for you it's only elev
en for the Germans and one for you. I never 
got a chance to shoot it. But it uh...I mean to 
use it. He left me the gun, took...he embraced us 
both. He says I don't know if we'll ever see 
again. He was very...he was in terrible shape 
because he had to walk hundred plus kilome ters. He told us that the front was now between 
Harkov and Kiev . Kiev...I think Kiev was lib
erated already. It was between Kiev and 
Kamenets Podolski, and the Germans are retreati
ng but he said keep a low profile. Wa tch out 
for the Ukrainian, for the Banderoski, he said for the Nationalistic organization. The time 

were...the winter of '43-44 was a hard winter. 
We stayed with that couple. We had terrible 
problems. Problems mostly of food. Food wa
s a a major item. The people had...I don't 
know...the nearer the front came to us, the frie
ndlier the woman was but the more hostile the 
ma n was. I don't know why. Uh we dec...we decide
d quite a few times to leave, but we didn't 
have a place where to hide. The area wa
s hostile. The pop...population was hostile. So we 
stayed for them. Anyway when the...in in uh at
 the end of February the uh we saw already 
forerunners of the Red army and here our hos
ts suddenly got extremely friendly. They came 
out. They gave us a couple of new...for me  a pa
ir of new pants. They 
gave my wife a pair 
shoes. We  took...uh say goodbye to them. They...a
nd we started to ma ke our way back 
toward Czernowitz. In the summe r of '44 I d
ecided to join the Polish army and uh I was 

brought by the Russian, uh one Russian _______ to
 what Poland...where the front was now 

in uh...Lublin (ph) was free. The suburb of Wa
rsaw was Prague (ph)...not the Czech Praga 
but Praga of Poland is a suburb of Wa rsaw
, was uh uh burning. There was an uprising, the 
Polish uprising, not the Jewish. Jewish t
ook place in '43. The Polish uprising under uh 
General Bor Komorowski, which had failed. The 
German uh destroyed the city and we were 
looking at Warsaw burning. To tell you the tr
uth, we didn't mi nd Wa rsaw burning. There 
was a feeling of...in spite of the hotilit...of the f
act that I was now a Polish officer - in that 
time I was uh I was a Lieutenant, ear, nose and 
throat ma n. I uh...I forgot to me ntion when 
we to _____ (ph), he...I...uh again one of these lu
cky incidents. I found that the person in 
charge of organizing the medical corps of 
the 2nd Army uh Army, Druga Army of Polska, 
the 1st Polish Army was formed in Russia.
 The 2nd Polish Army was formed on Polish 
territory. There was a man by the name of Lole
k Cherzoff (ph), a former friend of mi ne, a 
Communist, who was a doctor who had studied in 
Prague. The only thing not in the...in in in 
uh German university but in the Czech universit
y. It happened that I had met him in Prague, 
him and his wife. She was Anka Silvershatz from 
Lodz (ph). She wasn't  there. He said she is 
un...still under the Germans. He knows only that she is
 alive and he is going to try her, try to 
get her out through the Polish underground but 
not the Armi a Kraiowa. There were two 
Polish underground, the Armi a Ludowa. That means the people's army, which was leftist. 

Here I was in, working in uh ______. I was clothed 
in the Polish uniform. I was an officer. I 
had found a friend who said where would you 
like to go, but they put into a group, an 
independent group, an ear, nose and throat a
nd ophthalmology group with my own couple of 
trucks, with a group of four soldiers, four f
our nurses. We were...the Russians called this 
group gypsy outfit, Tziganski Outriat (ph), because that group was sent from hospital to 

hospital to operate the wounded and as soon as they
 finished their task. I was assigned in that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0021 
21
 
 
time to a uh a city by...small city by the name 
of Shedlitz. Shedlitz is eighty kilometers 
south-east of Warsaw where the hospital 
to which I was assigned was called the 22nd 
Hospital for Light Wounded. The _____ ___________, in
 Polish. And here I stayed until 
January, until the front...Warsaw was liberated and we went west. Uh... 
 
Q: Tell me about liberation. 

 

A: It is...you know, we asked ourselves ma ny times...f
rom...we at one point Gusti said to me...I 
think in '43...you know Fritz (ph), we probably 
are the only Jews around here. And it was a 
very frightening...and we started 
to discuss how come we are still alive, and in eight, uh in 
'44 when we were liberated, we we...I thought 
about it. I had no money. We were strangers. 

We  were foreigners in Poland. Didn't know th
e language too well. I didn't know Ukrainian 
too well. I didn't know Polish too well. The only 
thing I was a physician and I came back to 
the term which they had called us always...the Romanian physician. Number one I was a 

physician. I was helpful to the population and I reme
mbered what the priest in Belce, Father 
______ had said in his sermon - with the uh lo
cal Jews you can do whatever you want. They 
regarded us as...yes, we were Jews but we were 
foreign Jews and we were
 helpful. I got, as a 
doctor as a matter of fact, a very good reputation 
as an obstetrician. I was not qualified to be 

an obstetrician. I got once a call to a delivery wh
ere the woman had been in labor three days, 
and I was very...I wanted...I was reluctant to 
go there because I felt I'm not qualified. When I 
came there I checked the woma n. You know, you have to do some thing, and I ma de the 

diagnosis that the child had what they call in 
this country in obstetrics a rim (ph) of the 
cervix around the head. It was...that means it 
was almost fully dilated and while I was 
checking her she had one good contraction 
and out came a baby boy, yelling. The whole 
excitement with the delivery, number one it was a baby boy. It was a luck to be a crying 

baby, you know, and the doctor had just...they gave 
me the credit. I was just an innocent by-
stander there but I got the reputation as a as 
a fine, good obstetrician. Undeserved I have to 
say, but I got that reputation and I certainly wa
sn't  going to refuse the food which they gave 

me for that call, because we needed it very 
badly, so uh comi ng back why we survived. No 
money, no language, foreigners, but I was a doctor 
and this had helped. It had helped. Luck. 
I would say 99.9% the element of
 luck helped us in our survival. Who has the...basically, 
you needed only a couple of people or one pers
on to find who is friendly toward you. I me t 
Mr. Zarevski from the Polish underground. He 
was going to use me  for his purpose as a 
courier, you know, to Roma nia, but I had 
some body who stood, who who who trusted me . 
Some body who wanted to help. True, I should 
do things for them, but who, where in the 
world do you find such a a uh lucky person. Numb
er two, Vasia_. He picked me  up. I didn't 
look, I didn't know him, and again, how we
ll do you know Russian?   How well do you know 

the northern part of Bukovina, because from th
ere we were to get to the border with no 
problem, you know. You could. They, they had contact with people, but beyond they...you 

know, they needed some body...here there was some body who who could ma nage and I felt 

in that time I could manage and then I was 
young, was in pretty good shape. I was always a 
sportsma n. Uh I wouldn't say I was adventurous
, but I was daring to a certain degree. Why 
was I daring?   Because I had to. I had to. How ma ny times in our, in our uh uh ______ in the

woods, I came to a point, it's right and left. Th
ere is no sign where it says where to go. There 
were no people there to ask where to go. Luc
k. Luck, again, again. Many times when I went 
to uh wrong I had to go back and go, you know, because it uh that part led me into a little 
community and we tried to stay away fr
om communities. The population was hostile. You 
needed only one or two persons who were fr
iendly, who were able to...or not able...willing. 
99.9% luck. That if they caught us, there was 
no question. We  had left our friends. Doctor 
Gabriel Zinreich still in Korolovka and they 
hoped, they felt that what I'm doing and Gusti 
is, has no chance. I knew that my chances were 
uh small, but my point of view was I'm going 
to try. At least try. To give in without tr
ying, I wasn't  going to do it. No. And uh as uh you 
know, it's the results which count and uh comi ng to 
this country, I tried, we tried to push that 

experience aside. Very very uh uh convinced that
 we...in order to grow roots in this country, 

we have to put our experience and not to 
think about it. Many things have to be 
accomplished. Very eagerly a family, and when
 we found...Gusti had seven pregnancies and 
she, in these seven pregnancies...she had 
no problem getting pregnant. She had problems 
carrying the baby. She...the first baby uh was six 
months, then five and a half months, four 
and a half months...but we are talking not 
about the times today where you have a well-
equipped pre uh uh...a baby with a premature nursery. In that time they didn't have premature 

nursery. We  had one baby alive in 1971, and 
the baby...the chief of the anesthesia 
departme nt came to me  and said Fred, we
 know your history. Uh you lost so ma ny...uh the 
baby was two and a half pounds. It...a two and a 
half pound baby in that time...I recessitated 
the baby myself. As an anesthesiologist I am
 equipped to do it and it was a baby with a good 
sucking reflex and some  and I wanted to kee
p...if I could have kept that baby even in my 
hospital, it was a hospital in Brooklyn, St. John'
s Street and, or St. John's Avenue, and uh it 
uh it ma y have survived. He convinced me  to send the baby to Baby's hospital. He said this 

Presbyterian hospital, the fi nest hospital in New 
York, and there in order to to feed the baby 
they _____ the baby. They put a tube and, but ag
ain, here we are in 1951. The tube was not 
uh...it was a polyethylene tube and in that time 
they may have been short of polyethylene 
tubes because they they uh uh sterilized it, 
by changing every second or third day, by boiling 
it. Polyethylene uh in that time when you boil it, 
it gets stiff like a board. And in their uh in 
their uh procedures they perforated the stomac
h of the baby, and while they were feeding the 
baby the the belly of the baby got bigger and bi
gger and one day I get a call from the chief 
resident. He was a Swedish uh re
sident. He said Dr. Bernard, we'll have to operate on the 

baby. I say why do you have to operate...it was five da
ys later, or six days later. She said we 
took an x-ray. We  put some  uh some  uh radio-
opaque ma terial, and we found the tube was 
not in the stomach but was in the abdominal
 cavity. That means you have a perforated 
stomach. They operated on the baby, and was 
a healthy, fighting baby, and uh but small, 
premature, and uh the baby survived surgery for two days and died of generalized ______.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

A: I would like to mention a uh an event whic
h occurred to me in 1943, which really didn't 
make sense to me uh in that time but it cam
e so spontaneous. Gusti and I were standing 
outside our uh our uh hiding pl
ace, uh some  two hundred, three hundred feet away from it, 
and there was a  (ph) in front of, to the right, to
 the left of the trees, and on that  (ph) there 
was a shepherd with...I don't know if they were sheep. It ma y have been uh goats, but it was 

such a pastoral scene that I started to sing...I 
started to sing a song by Schubert (ph), Shafer's 
klage lied (ph)_. This is uh uh the shepherd
's  uh song, but he's  complaining, you know. And 
I knew the words from a child, that ___________ _______, and so on and so on, and I was 

singing it. Gusti turned around. She looked at
 me  and said, I don't know...we are not only 
refugees. We  are so much of zurah (ph). 
We  have nothing to eat. We  don't know what's 
going...and here you are standing and singing Sc
hubert's ______  uh Shafer's klage lied. I 
said it it it brought back something here which I 
cannot explain but to be in the mi ddle of of 
that woods...without Jews, you know, where the the 
area is Juden rein (ph) and to start 
singing a Schubert song...there must be an emoti
onal uh substrata which which had its effect. 
Uh I would like to come back to the element of
 evaluation of the attitude of the Red Army. It 
is some thing which we found, and we discusse
d it in the Pole...while in the Polish Army 
among ourselves...we were a group of Jewish physicians there and uh when the Ger...the Red 

Army went back in 1941 under the uh German pounding, they...it was an army... 
 

Q: Mr. Bernard, we'r e going to run out of so much
 time...we'd want to discuss the liberation and 
your comi ng to America. 
 

A: I see. Alright. 

 

Q: Sorry to do that... 

 

A: Alright. Uh...coming to the United States as 
uh we came in the winter of '49-'50. It was a 
cold winter for us. We were new in this count
ry. We had to learn a language. I had to prepare 
myself to to to pass an English exam, which I 
did after three months, and I had to submit my 
credentials to the Department of Education in 
Albany. I was admitted to the to take the exam 
uh without an internship because I had gradua
ted before 1940 and I could show that I had a 
residency of two and a half years in uh ear,
 nose and throat and _____ surgery. Uh I took the 
exam. I was lucky to pass the first time and uh after a year only in this country I found 

myself to have the license to practice medicine
 but I felt I would like to go into an American 
hospital to take an internship, and during the inte
rnship I really fell into anethethsia which in 

that time was a new specialty uh with all the challenges and uh since I liked challenges in life 

always I felt I mi ght find, I may find in this  specialty uh more satisfaction. I spent the last 

forty years or thirty-nine years in this count
ry in the operating room. I uh...my work has been 
found to be quite satisfactory. I was lucky to be uh to be uh nominated director of a

department since 1961. I uh...when I retired in
 1985, uh from the from the practice of 
medicine, having arrived at the age of seve
nty-three and uh at Saint uh Saint uh Saint 
Joseph's Hospital in Queens uh the depart...the hospital admi nistration was very appreciative 
of my of my uh, not of my retirement but of 
my actions. They gave me a very as every 
retiree,  a golden watch and uh they uh rented, 
uh the staff rented a uh yacht, the Riveranda 

(ph). Invited the whole staff of the hosp
ital and we traveled, you know, around Manhattan, 

so it was really a very appreciative gesture. Uh
 I had the...I invited...my family was invited to 
that retirement party and uh I really cherished that thought. During these thirty-nine years, I 

would say I uh performe d probably close to 
over twenty thousand procedures. Uh I uh 
handled probably seventy percent of our sta
ff, doctors, families...we had a staff of around 
four hundred physicians and uh unfortunately in 1970 
I lost my first wife to uh cancer of the 
breast. Adele (ph) happened to be a neighbor 
of ours and our children grew up together. She 
had two sons, has two sons and my two a
dopted children, Robert and Linda, grew up 

together with her children. We found ourselves
 uh, you know, being thrown together in '74 

and uh got married in '77. Adele retired from 
her work. She was a college professor. She 
taught education and early childhood at City University in New York, _____ College. 
 

Q: Thank you very much. I think you've covered everything. 

 

A: Thank you for telling the story and bringing a 
little town, Korolovka, into the history of the 
Holocaust. I still think it was necessary. 
 

Q: Thank you for sharing it with us. 

 

A: Thankyou.
