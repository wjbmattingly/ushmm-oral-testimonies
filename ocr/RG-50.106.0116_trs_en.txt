Question: This is the 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Reg i na  Spieg el
, conducted by 
Margaret Garrett
 on May 11, 1999 in
 Silver 
Spring, Ma ryla nd.
 This is a follow up in
terview that will focus
 
on
 Regina 
Spiegel™s
 post-Holocaust experiences. In prep
aration for this interview, I watched 
the videotape of the interview you conduc
ted with the Holocaus
t eyewitness project 
of 
Wash ington, D.C. 
in 1989, and listened to part of the audiotap e interview you 
conducted with the 
Jewish Community Council of Greater
 Washington
 on March 
5
th
, 1985. I will not ask you to repeat ev
erything you said in those interviews. 
Instead, I will use this interv
iew as an opportunity to fo
llow up on those interviews 
and fo cus on your post-Holocaust experi
ences. This is tape number one, side
 A.
 
What was your name at birth? 
Answer: At birth, 
Regina Œ Regina  Gutman.

Q: Œ how that happened? 
A: Yeah, okay. In Œ as I spoke previous
ly, from the other tape
 you probably heard 
that on th e last part of our journey, so to 
speak, we found ourselves in Œ closed up in 
cattle trains. They were shipping us, 
to where we don™t exactly know, but 
supposedly, from what we™ve heard after th
e war, that our journey was taking us to 
Dach au. 
Q: And you had been where? 
A: In 
Elsnig
 by 
Torgau. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It was our last camp Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ that we were in. 

Q: And we is who? 

A: The group, you know, th
e whole Œ you know, we were like about 3,000 wo men. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So the group, when I speak we, I refer 
to the Œ to the whole 
camp, so to speak. 
Q: Okay . 
A: They put us on these cattle trains
 and we were traveling. And in 
Germany
, all of 
a sudden we had to stop. And why di
d we have to stop? Because in 
Germany
 the

railroad tracks were bombed. This was alrea
dy 1945, you see, mo st of the time, to 
tell you the truth, didn™t know exactly when , what time it was. But later we found 
out that the war was getting Œ was almo st of
 the brink of being finished, except we 
didn™t realize. But when we stopped at ou
r Œ in our train because th e railroad tracks 
were bombed, we couldn™t go 
Œ excuse me Œ much farthe
r. So wh at had happen ed, 
while we were waiting there for repairs, the 
SS
 had this speech to us, he said hey, 
you ought to be very happy,
 because this is April 20
th
, 1945, it™s 
Hitler™s
 birthday. 
And we, we were thinking why in th
e hell should we be happy that it™s 
Hitler™s
 
birthday? But of course he said we will give
 you an extra piece of bread to celebrate 

it. And no so oner did he finish as the whol
e sky became black and we were actually 
bombed. Our trains were hit by the allies. No
t direct, but next to it. And actually, we 
were like about 3,000 women, probab Œ 
[coughs] 
excuse me Œ probab Œ 
Q: You want a cough drop? 

A: No, I Œ I am using a Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Probably a thousand of us
 got killed by the bombs, and 
the rest of us, when this 
train split open, and we saw like an opening,
 the ones who were able to, we just ran 
into the woods. We hid out. We couldn™t stay
 there too long, beca
use after all, they 
didn™t give us that extra piece of bread, 
so we couldn™t do a Œ hide out too mu ch ,

and we finally came out and we spotted th
is Ru ssian Œ he was like a Œ probably like 
a colonel in the army. And we ran over to
 him and he said, do
n™t worry, you are 
free. And that™s how we actually were lib
erated, which was already like not exactly 
April 20
th
, because it took us lik
e two days longer. But a
pparently, the Russians 
were already there. I always say, had the Ge
rmans left u s in that
 camp, we probably 
would have been liberated by th e Americ
ans, because I think wh ere we were 
liberated was almost very n
ear where the Americans and 
the Russians met, near the 
Elbe 
river. 
Q: Excuse me, that ma kes a sound. 
A: Oh yes? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Okay . So  anyhow, that was mi ne liber
ation. So  wh at do 
you do after you were 
liberated? You know, we had thru Œ in a 
way, we had a ch ance, because we could 
have Œ and the Russians were encouraging 
us to go on a ramp
age, you know. The 
Germans killed us, you go out
, you have a chance now, 
kill the Germans. But you 
know what? We decided this wasn™t our way. 

Q: Wh-When they were telling yo
u to do this, how did they Œ 
A: The Russians? 

Q: Yeah, did you have weapons to Œ 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999

A: No, we didn™t have weapons, but we 
could have gotten Œ they  would have been 
delighted  to give us a Œ one of their guns. 
Q: The Russians would have? 
A: Yeah, they would have, but Œ 
Q: So th ey would have helped you? 

A: Definitely. But we decided ourselves th
at™s no way to go, and we just figured 
because we didn™t like what 
they were doing to us, we w
ould turn around doing the 
same thing to them. After a
ll, the German that I would 
have picked  up, I probably 
would have never Œ ha
d never seen him before. It woul
d have been ju st picking up a 
German because he was German. And it Œ th
is wasn™t our way. And the next thing 
what we started doing is let™s go home. Let™s try to get home. 

Q: N-Now when  you say we, were Œ who 
Œ where Œ did you have special friends 
that you were with? 

A: We kind of got Œ wh en we were liberat
ed, because we were so used to always 
being in groups, like I didn't
 know how to be by my self.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I-It Œ so like about 15 girls, we got toge
ther and we like di 
Œ did things together. 
If we wanted to get some bread Œ because 
we didn™t have like what the Americans 

did on th e American zone, a displaced pe
rsons camp where they  fed you. With the 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

Russians you didn't have anything like this
. The only thing what
 they did for you, 
we would go to them and say take Œ let™s 
go to a German bakery with us. And th ey 
would go with us and th ey
 would requisition from the ba
ker, bread for us. So we Œ 
and we, our type of eating wa
s very crude. Bread and wa
ter, that™s all we needed, 
you know, to keep us alive. 
So that™s what we got, we got mostly bread and water. 
Because even when we got into  a German 
house, even if we saw some food there, 
you know, because what was 
happening after the war, a lot of German households 
became empty. Why? Because the Germans 
were afraid of the Russians and they 
were running to ward s the Amer
ican zone. So they left a 
lot of their homes with no 
one there. So when  we woul
d go in, we would find maybe
 some food over there. I 
remember in one place, they
 had to spe Œ th ese beautiful, you know, like fruits, 
apples and cherries put in in jars, like
 we put away sometimes fruits. We were 
afraid to eat them because 
we thought that maybe they 
poisoned it. So we wouldn™t 
even touch this. But we would have th
e bread from the baker and th e water and 
that™s how we contin ued going towards 
Poland
. 
Q: Now, you would ask a Russian
 to requisition bread for you? 
A: Yeah, a Russian soldier. 
Q: Yeah. Were all the Russian so
ldiers helpful to you, or Œ

A: Mos-Mo st of the time yes. You see, th
ey didn™t have this type o-of gan Œ 
organization like they had with the Œ th
e Americans had. You know, what the 
Americans did, they  found the surv ivors, 
they put them in in
to a camp and they 
supplied food and you had a place where to
 put down your head
. With the Russians 
you had nothing like that.  
Q: But some Russians in some
 places were abusive to Œ 
A: To women. 
Q: To wo men, and Œ 
A: Definitely. 

Q: Œ did you enco unter any of that? 
A: A Œ well, we learned to Œ 
to  kind of counteract that. Le
t™s put it this way. During 
the day, ess Œ you know, I told you, we were
 15 girls of us. As a matter of fact, we 
took out from one of these homes, a horse 
and one of those Œ it was like a coach Œ 
not a co Œ you know, a horse and buggy? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But it™s not a b Œ it wasn™t a buggy, it wa
s like the most beautiful
 si Œ here at the 
Smithsonia n
 I walked in one time, in front wa
s sitting this coach, you know, it was 
the mo st gorgeous thing if I would have ke
pt it and would Œ wouldn™t have to had to 
worry about any finances becau
se it probably was worth at 
Œ a fortune. But we were 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999

traveling in this horse and buggy a little bit.
 During the day, let™s say where we Œ if 
we were in a certain town 
during the day, we would sp
lit up a little bit and go into 
different places to sleep. Like we would 
sleep where the horses would sleep in Œ in 
some kind of Œ wh at do they call them, the 
barns, like. Or the pigs, or some others, 
because we were actually very much afraid
 of Œ of raping, because during the war, 
you see, i-in 
Germany
, I never worried about bein
g raped by a German, because 
this was something that they were not a
llowed to do. If Œ if 
a German got caught 
raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble. So
 they usually stayed away from us. They 
probably  were raping 
more German women. 
Q: What Œ what was that abou
t, that they were not allo
wed to rape Jewish women? 
A: Oh, that™s was the 
Œ what they called the 
rassenschande
. 
Rassen
, the race, 
schande 
is the Œ a Œ you know, shame. 
Q: Shame. 
A: The Œ the Œ the race shame, you know, 
otherwise you Œ you like committed the 
worst sin. I mean, you commit a sin wh en y
ou rape anybody, but this, th Œ it wasn™t 
the raping that they were wo
rried. So after the war we did have to Œ the women, and 
I don™t Œ we got away  Œ we got aw ay kind 
of lucky, but a lot of women weren™t that 
lucky. 

Q: It sounds as though you also were careful. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
11
A: Very, very, as I say. You see, when I 
was liberated in ™45, I was already almost 
like 19 years old. You know, 
through the war years, you be
came very adep t, let™s 
put it this way, and like self preservation. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So mo st of us were really looking out 
for these things. When  
we notice in a town  
that there were Russian soldiers, too many 
Russian soldiers, that
 they might go out 
on Œ you know, at night, look
ing for women, we didn't  st
ay in that town. We would 
march on. We Œ like I said, we had this 
horse and buggy, so 
we could move on a 
little bit more. And also, we met some Italia
n  guys who must have been working in 
Germany
. You know, they came to 
Germany
 to work. And they were also lik e 
trying to  get back. So  sometimes, you see, 
the Russians, if they saw you with a Œ 

with another man, they would 
just stay away from you.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So we, during the day, 
we would like, if we were 
visible, we would go with 
them. 

Q: The Italian guys. 

A: Mm-hm. And then we just
 lost them. Came to anot
her town , we looked  around 
what was bat Œ we were very much aware,
 and I™m really  surprised Œ you probably 
heard from other people because you the fi
rst one ever asking me really, that 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
12
question, how Œ because we we
re Œ were a lot afraid of
 being raped by the Russian 
soldiers. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So an yhow, after Œ to tell you th e truth,
 how long it took us to get to the Polish 
border, I really don™t know, but I figure that
 it must have taken us like about three 
weeks. First of all, when we were liber
ated, there was one friend that was very Œ 

from the bombs, she was a little
 bit more in Œ and sh-she 
Œ you know, like she lost a 
couple fingers and she was mo re troubled th an mo st of us. You know, like I had a 

little bit of a i-injury, you 
know, like a shrapnel? A piece 
of shrapnel got into my 
hand, but it wasn™t Œ you know, I never fe
lt it. You know, it wasn™t dangerous for 
me. But with her, we had to put her in in a hospital. So she actu
ally stayed in the 
hospital. We couldn™t, you see, we couldn™t
 keep on staying in
 the same town for 
too long because we were actually afraid of 
this. So we actually 
had to leave her in 
the hospital, but there was another friend th
at she met th at stay
ed with her. So she 
was like more or less taken care of. But 
we kept on going an
d probably took us 
probably like about three weeks til we got
 to the Polish border. And when I got 
there Œ and you know, as you 
were walking Œ you see, when we were liberated, 
would you believe that most 
of us didn™t realize that most of our families were 
murdered? We still were hopi
ng that maybe somebody™s gonna be alive because I 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
13
will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, 
because that™s what kept us thro ugh all 
the other times, kept us going, because if not  we probably  at one time or another, 
we would have given up. Bu t that was, in
 a way, kept us Œ 
hey, you stay alive 
because you promised that we™re gonn
a meet at home. You know, like my 
boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, 
when they were sepa
rate Œ when they 
separated us in 
Auschwitz
 he said to me, if we stay 
alive, just remember, meet me 
in mine hometown. Bu t also, he didn't  know 
that my mother told
 me this, when we 
were, you know, it was just practically in 
the beginning of the war when  she got us 
all together and she said, just remember, 
if God forbid we sh
ould get separated Œ 
you see, never thinking that wh at™s going 
to happen, that it™s 
going to be this mass 
killing, but just separated. If we go, maybe
 I was someplace else or something, she 
says, reme mb er, after the war, we™ll me et 
in our place, you know
, in our home. So 
naturally, the first thing what I wanted to 
do is get back home. So  I did. That™s how 

Œ and mo st of us Œ 
Q: Back to
 Radom
? 
A: Back to 
Radom
, but by the time when I hit th
e Polish border, it was the city
 
Pozna

. That was like on germ Œ Po lish German border. I don™t know wh ether Œ 
you know, I think it™s not any more 
Pozna

, I think they call it now 
Wroclaw,
 
because this became part of 
Germany
, you know, ne Œ I th
ink so  they call it 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
14
Wroclaw, 
I™m almost sure. Or maybe it™s still 
there, I haven™t looked at the map. 
Maybe after I finish this intervie
w I will take a look at the map. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But we got to this town
 Pozna

, 
and when I got to 
Pozna

, the trains in 
Poland 
were running already. Because you see, 
Poland
 was actually liberated in ™44, 
towards the end of ™44, th Œ it Œ the beginn
ing of ™45. So their 
trains were already 
running. They weren™t ma
ybe bomb ed as mu ch, because they weren't bombed by 
the allies, the allies 
[in d ecipherable]
 had lots of bombs. And I dropped Œ I will 
never forg et this, I drove Œ I Œ I didn™t driv
e, how do you call it ? 
I brought this horse 
and buggy on th e station and left it there ju
st like that because actually, we were 15 
girls, no one wanted to go near the horse. 
I said to them, you 
went through such a 
war. You™re afraid of a little horse? I mean
, he was that Œ he probably w-wa Œ I 
wish all through the war I would have ha
d the dealing with the horse and Œ other 
than with the people. I said, and you™re afra
id? So they were afra
id to go near the 
horse, so I was the one that fed the horse, 
I was the one that took him in Œ now I 
probably  wouldn™t know how to  deal with 
it, but at the time, you know, wh en  your 
life is at stake, or wh atever it is that 
you have, I came to the 
conclu sion that human 
nature, you would do what you 
have to do for survival. 
Q: And had you had any experi
ence with a horse before? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
15
A: Never, never. 
Q: So you didn™t know anything about Œ 

A: I was a Œ I wa Œ I was a city girl. 
Q: Œ handle Œ so you didn™t know
 anything about handling a horse? 
A: Never. Never in my life Œ 

Q: But you learned fast. 

A: Œ did Œ did I go close to a horse, but I 
didn't know Œ you see, now I know a horse 
can kick you or something.
 I didn™t even know a horse 
can do that 
to you. But I 
knew that it was the only way that 
if we wanted to get back to 
Poland
, rather than 
walking step by step. And that was also a l
it Œ a little bit in our way, that we had this 
mobility a little bit, that when we realized that this town 
isn™t so safe for us. I mean, 
not with our lives, but with 
our Œ you know, virginity. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So we figured  we better keep on using it.
 And that™s what I did, so I left in 
Pozna

,
 somebody had a very good 
deal on me, left in 
Pozn an
 this gorgeous, 
gorgeous thing, with  the horse. And of cour
se, then we start Œ got on that train, no 
tickets. I don™t know wh ere 
[indecipherable]
 going 
[indecipherable]
 going to th e 
trains, you know, on the outsid
e, because we had no money. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
16
Q: Did th ey require that you had ticket 
Œ have a ticket if you were a returning 
refugee? 
A: They might have. You want to know 
something but Œ there were so many people 
in the trains that probably 
the co nducto r could never manage to get them that Œ to 
go and ask him for anything because you ju
st got on th e train 
and you hopped off 
wherever it stopped. And th en how we st
opped in one place, and somebody passes 
me by, and he actually had walked away 
already and came running back. He said 
Reginka
(ph) to me. He recognized me, we were
 in one of the camp s together in 
Pionki
, you know, that was Œ we were the only camp  where men and wo men 
work ed to gether, but I was. And he says hey,
 you know th at your 
boyfriend is alive? 
That™s when I found out that 
Sam
 was alive. So I already felt a little bit better 
because I felt I Œ it™s true, I™m going back into
 my city and I™m going to look for my 
family, but at least my boyfriend is a
live. Because by the time we w ere getting to
 
Poland,
 the closer we were getting, we realize more and more that our families 
were dead, but we s
till couldn™t accept it. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: In a way it reminds me a lots of times
 when God fo rbid , you have a very si Œ 
terrible sick spouse, and you 
know he™s gonna die, or sh
e™s gonna die, i Œ you just 
don™t want to accept it. And I think that 
was with us, you know, now that I™m Œ I 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
17
never thought of it then, but hi-i Œ but now
 that I™m older, I put Œ I can think a little 
bit differently than I did in those years. A
nd I think mo st of us didn™t want to accept 
the idea that everybody was d
ead. So you clung to it. But at lea st, a s  I say in my 
case, at least I knew my boyfriend, if he be
haves himself and if he is waiting for me, 

and if he thinks of me as mu ch as I th
ink of him, maybe we™ll be able to get 
together. So finally I got to my city, 
Ra do m.
 To tell you the truth,
 when I got there, 
I don™t know exactly, but Œ 
have you ever been to 
Europe
? 
Q: Yes. Not to 
Poland
, but other parts. 
A: Yeah, but you know like other, like bel Œ 

Q: 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary. 
A: 
Œ 
bel Œ it would be the same thing. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: You know how before you 
walk in into the places wh
ere you actually lived, you 
walk into  a big gate? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah, and th en you go into  the courtyar
d. Well, I did that. I came to my place 
where I used to live, it was called
 Jerome Skakel
(ph) 21. This street was 
Jerome 
Skakel
(ph), he was a Polish writer, the name of
 the street, was actu ally the main 

street of the city and the number of the bu
ilding was 21, and a Œ I walked in. And no 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
18
sooner did I go in, I haven™t even Œ becau
se we lived a little b
it farther into the 
place, and I had this idea that I was going 
to walk in into my
 place, knock on the 
door, because by then I really knew already 
that most of our Œ 
my family was dead. 
And I Œ but I figured I will kn
ock at the door and just 
ask it. Tell them who I am. 
Maybe if somebody else from 
my  family comes and ask Œ tell him that the sister is 
alive. And I was also going to  ask him, yo
u know wh at? I lost all my  pictures in 
Auschwitz
, and it always bothered me that here
 I lived through it and I don™t even 
have a picture to look at it. You know, 
it™s Œ it seems so funny, because when  you 
have access to it, i-it really isn™t that im
portant, but I hear more and more people 
when their homes are on fire or somethin
g they run back. Fo r what do they  run 
back? For their pictures. And the same thi
ng I thought maybe when we left for the 
ghetto. My  mo ther couldn™t take everything
. I™m sure she took some pictures, but 
she prob Œ maybe she left some pictures 
and maybe these people would have those 
pictures. That wouldn™t mean anything. But 
no so oner did I walk in into that place, 
you know, walked th ro ugh this back 
gate, somebody caught me and said 
Reginka
(ph). 
Reginka
(ph), by the way, is a name for Œ like
 Regina
. It™s Œ in Polish 
you use it like a diminutive, yeah. Say hey
, Reginka
(ph), what are you doing here? 
They just shot
 Gudsztat
(ph), otherwise a neighbor of 
ours, came back. He came 
back maybe a month before. They used to 
have a jewelry store before the war, and

he took back the jewelry store. 
I mean, the Russians weren™t yet in 
Poland
 like later 
on they came in. As it was, later on 
it didn™t make any difference because the 
Russians took away from it. Bu
t he took back the jewelry store that belonged to his 
family. Somebody came, knocked at the door, th
at same  time that I 
came in into our 
city, and killed him. And th is girl grabbed me, she says, let Œ g Œ ru n. And she and 
me started running. And wh ere do we run?
 There™s no place where to run. We run 
into where the ghetto used to be in
 Radom.
 They had Œ they 
made like out of a 
warehouse, they made like almost like 
a Œ a Œ what they call a Œ a community 
center, you know, so wh en Œ because so 
many people were coming back into  the 
city and they  had no place where to go. So
 at least you should be ab le to put down 
your head  and what we used to do, in a pl
ace like this, we woul
d Œ they would have 
like sheets of paper on the wa
lls, and you would put
 in your name. So at least I felt 
like Œ so I put down  my  name, and Œ 
Regina Gutman
, am Œ you know, so maybe if 
somebody will look thro
ugh, they will find me or if they know 
[indecipherable]
 of 
course, nobody found me except my  boyfrie
nd by then already heard that I got back 

to
 Ra do m
 and I Œ 
Q: He Œ your b
oyfriend heard Œ 
A: Y-Yeah. 

Q: Œ that you had gotten back? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
20
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

A: You know true, I always say it™s amazi
ng. We didn™t have telephones, we didn™t 
Œ but through th e way Œ thro ugh the grapev
ine, you know. People were walking. 
The people were walking, i-it was like 
the ma rch of the masses. People were 
walking from
 Radom
 to  
Germany
. People were coming from 
Germany
 into 
Radom.
 So as you were walking, you met 
some people, and we had a way to 
identify ourselves, to Œ to as
k you, let™s say if I pass by 
somebody that I thought th at 
looked a little bit familiar but I wasn™t 
too sure, I would just address him as 
amho
(ph). You know, just go by 
amho
(ph). And this was almo st like our password. 
It™s a Hebrew wo rd for Œ like folks. You know, a country  Œ 
Q: Folk s? 

A: Yes. A Œ maybe I™ll ask 
Sam
 a Œ a better definition of, because he speaks 
Hebrew much better, but
 amho
(ph). So if Œ if he heard the word 
amho
(ph), he 
realize that I™m Jewish too. 
Do  you know Œ of course, we 
were plenty identifiable in 
the beginning an yhow. I Œ all right, I didn™t wear any more mine suit what I had 

what Œ when I was liberated, 
my striped suit, because this I got rid of at the first 
thing. The minute I got in into a German
 house Œ I told you I wouldn™t touch th e 
food, but I looked around in their clothing and wh atever the clothing was, I got rid 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
21
of that because I just couldn™t seem myse
lf walking through in this striped suit. 
Because if you saw somebody in that stripe
d suit, you knew, more or less that they 
were Jewish. But this what we had, you 
know, in order to id
entify ourselves. So 
people, you started and the minute you knew 
th at he was Jewish too, you stopped it. 
Where you coming from? I am fro m here. Di
d you see a n ybody? And that™s how we 
got a little bit, you know, like 
information. Like this, and 
Sa m
 probably found out 
through this way that also that I was aliv
e. And as a matter of fact, I didn™t even 
stay, that same night I was going to  spend 
the night in that center, but I found a 
cousin of mines who actually was alrea
dy there. She just came down to see who 

else was co ming, because she actually was 
able to take back her apartment. She 
came back with a stepmo ther
 and she, when she saw me
, she said, don™t stay here, 
you can come and stay with us in our 
apartment. So I went with her in the 
apartment. Was a little bit Œ mu
ch more comfortable to stay
 there, and that™s what it 
was. And then of course, 
Sam
 and Œ
 Sam 
found out that I was aliv e, he sent for me. 
He got somebody with
 a horse and a buggy, because that™s what it wa-was basically 
the mode of transportation, you can s
till see it over there. And I went to 
Kozienice
. 
Q: Now how far was that from
 Radom
? 
A: It probably was maybe, 
at the mo st I would say like maybe 30 - 40 kilometers. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
22
A: Which isn™t really that mu ch. If Œ if we had to we co uld have almo st walked 
there, but we didn™t. But we did have to 
walk a little bit because if the horse needed 
go up on a hill, we had to 
go down and push the hor Œ pu
sh the whole thing because 
Œ help th e horse along. 

Q: So what was that like fo
r you to be in the horse an
d buggy on your way to meet 
Sam
? 
A: I-It was Œ I would tell yo 
Œ you know what? It was so 
natural, you know, like I 
didn't  even think about it that it w as a Œ I 
was just hoping, because I hadn™t seen him 
yet, that he hadn™t lost the Œ the love
 for me, so to speak. But i-it was like 
adventurous in a way, you know. 
Q: Because you didn™t know what
 he would be like, and what Œ 
A: Exactly. 

Q: Œ it would be like. 

A: And I Œ it was Œ e Œ e Œ I met him in 1942, in Œ in that camp , and this was 
already 1945, so you know, th
ree years you haven™t seen each other. Of course, you 
know, you didn™t grow too mu ch in  camps
, you know, because they didn™t Œ so I 
was about the same size, you know, what I 
was. I mean the height I was about the 
same size. I was still pretty
 skinny, but it™s amazing. I 
Œ you know, when
 I survived, 
I weighed 69 pounds. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

23
Q: And how tall are you? 
A: Well, now I™m probably 
five three or five two. 
Q: And then , at the 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I was Œ when I came to the 
United States, 
the papers, on my  papers, they said 
that I was five four, but I don™t thi
nk I was ever five four, it probab Œ 
Q: And you weighed 69 pounds? 

A: 69 pounds. I was always a pretty tall 
girl for Œ you know, for European s. Y-Y Œ 
most Polish people aren™t very tall, 
so I was always considered a pretty 
[indecipherable]
 and I was pretty skinny, but it™
s Œ was amazing how even ju st on 
that diet of bread and wate
r and of course once I got to
 Radom
 I had already some 
soup too because they had 
a soup kitchen Œ you know, ho
w fast your body fills up. 
It™s amazin g . 

Q: We have to turn over the tape Œ 

A: Oh su re.

Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Reg i na  Spieg el
, tape number one, side
 B.
 Will 
you repeat what you just told me? 
A: Yeah Œ yes. I-It™s a lots of times when
 my husband and I, we
 would talk to one 
another, e-even with other su
rviv ors, we just can™t figure out how we even managed 
to survive even after the war, because we
 had no money. You know, we lived like 
homeless people. Really, when  you Œ when
 you th ink Œ except our brain wo rked 
pretty good, that was t h e on
ly thing. But really, how we
 managed to get through day 
after day with nothing, really, til o f c
ourse when I finally caught up with 
Sa m
, he 
ordered the head Œ we we
re like a little business in 
Poland
. 
Q: You and
 Sam? 
A: Yeah. Not me, he did, b
ecause when I came, he alrea
dy had it. He put
 a Œ but he 
will probably tell you, he put 
a mill that belonged to a friend of th eirs, a flour mill 
into working. And he started using that 
mill as making flour. And the Polish people 
would bring in the Œ the wh eat to make 
flour from it and all of a sudden when  I 
came there to 
Kozienice
, I didn™t have to go to requ
isition bread because all of a 
sudden I had money to
 go out and buy a brea
d. But really til then, I can™t figure out, 
because it took us at leas
t, by the time I caught up with
 him, it was like, I would 
say, almo st like towards the end of May. For a month to six weeks, we lived from 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

day to day, whatever came along. It was 
like an Œ struggling from day to day. Bu t 
then we decided one day th
at we couldn™t stay in 
Poland
, because it was really very 
dangerous, you know. I don™t know wh ethe
r you Jewish or not, you know, I never 
ask people, but it™s very hard for me to
 even tell this, because I-I feel almost 
ashamed. And mind you, what I went throu
gh, believe me there were plenty times 
where they  tried to ma ke me to be ashamed of being Jewish, or whatnot. Bu t I 
almost feel ashamed that I lived in a 
culture where coming back after such a 
horrible, horrible war, that our neighbors tr
uly didn™t want us. No t only didn™t they 
want us, they were really willing to almost
 go out and kill us. So
 my boyfriend and I 
decided one day, what the heck, w-we can™
t stay here, they g
onna kill us. We have 
to get out. And we Œ he Œ we got up one 
mo rning, like maybe five o™clock in  the 
mo rning, he went Œ he knew this man in 
Kozienice
 that gave you like almo st by 
then you had to have really a piece of 
paper to get on th e train. And we were 
supposed ly going to  the settle in the we
stern part, or the eastern part of 
Germany
, 
which the Poles were hoping to  sort of settle 
with Polish people, that
 in case if there 
ever was a question, whether th
ey should have it,
 if they should have a vote, wh ich 
they used to call the 
plebicid
(ph), they should have Po lis
h citizens. So we s-se n Œ 
went and gave them a piece of paper, the ma
n in the magistrate, 
and they Œ and they 
Œ you know, like Œ like Œ 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

26
Q: Sit Œ 
A: Œ the mayor. The city Œ 

Q: Like city hall. 
A: City hall, okay. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Which is the same thing. I-In ti Œ in city
 hall, gave us a piece of paper that sh Œ 
we should be able to get on the train. And 
when we got from this 
train to take us off 
Œ out of 
Poland
, th e train stopped and we didn™t 
even know where we were going, 
we just knew we had to get out of there.
 And when  the train stopped and there was 
another train next to us, and it was still 
summertime, so the windows were open, I 
hear somebody is talking and I turn ed around to
 Sam
, I said
 Sam,
 you know what? 
The other train, people speak, it sounds lik
e Polish, but it isn™t Polish. Maybe we™re 
in 
Czechoslovakia
. And you know wh at we did? 
We didn™t think too mu ch . We 
had this little, little suitcase, we to ok this 
little suitcase, we got 
out from this train, 
climbed underneath the trucks, through the ot
her train, walked in  and in to the other 

train, sat down. The train Œ the next tim
e the train stopped, we were in Œ in
 Prague, 
Czechoslovakia
. So we were breathing already a 
little bit lighter. As a matter of 
fact, I loved 
Czechoslovakia
. I wanted to stay there in. 
Q: Wa Œ why did 
you love it?  

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
27
A: You know what? When we were th
ere, their president came back from
 Russia
. 
Apparently during the war he escape to
 Russia
, and he came back. And I watched, 
for the first time in my lif
e, I watched the people of
 Prague
, the way they were 
greeting their president. They were hangin
g out from their windows and they were Œ 
with such  love and I figured , if people can 
have so much love for their president, 
that™s how much I knew about
 Œ you know, it somehow Œ I 
always say, with g Œ all 
going through all that war, I still, wh
en I was liberated I was still this 
Pollyanna
, 
what they used to call me wh
en I was a kid, that I coul
d never see any bad in  other 
people. So here, I looked here at these 
people greeting the president and I turn ed  
around to  say, they must be wonderful people. I never knew about 
Czechoslovakia
 
except wh at I learned in the history books. I 
mean, after all, when the war broke out, 

I was 13 years old, how mu ch did I lear
n about other countries, you know? But I 
always was Œ loved, you know, geograp hy and history. So I knew a little bit about 

them, but I didn't  know about them, but I di
dn't know ab out nature of people. But 
when I saw them greet like 
this, I said you know, we 
should stay here. But you 
know why we didn™t? We probably wouldn
™t mind. Because we heard that you had 
to be born there in order to
 become a citizen Œ to be 
a citizen. Otherwise, if you 
weren™t born there, you never become a 
citizen. So we were 
worried. What if it 
comes in something changes, we™re the first 
ones to be shipped 
out like they did in 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
28
Germany
, to a lot of Jews in 
Germany
, because if they weren™t from 
Germany
, 
they shipped them out. And by then , little
 by little we found out that the Americans 
were there. And also they Œ we got co Œ 
some people contacted us. You know, they 
picked us up, we were wondering how do
 they recognize, but it was easy to 
recognize us. 
Q: Well, who were the peop
le who picked  you out? 
A: It was people that work ed
 for the Jewish Distributio
n Committee, which is called 
the 
Joint. 
And a lot of them were work
ing also for what was then
 Palestine
, and 
they were trying to get together the re
fugees, you know. And 
then they took us 
actually on a Œ on a bus, it was an Ameri
can bus, a transport Œ er, later on Œ what 
I™ve heard lately, that because people were coming back 
and they gave Œ you know, 

like to 
Truman
, you know, when 
Truman
 became president, 
that they gave him 
news that for the Jews in 
Poland
 it™s so bad that s-somet h
ing has to be done, that 
they should be able to get 
out of there. So I Œ I understand that he actually saw to it 
that some of the borders were opened. You 
know here, right, we thought that we did 
such a act that we were able to smuggle our
selves into the other country  so easy, but 
it Œ apparently this was maybe already as 
a fact. And we were taken from there, we 
were taken on a bus into  
Germany
. 
Q: From
 Prague
 into 
Germany
? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
29
A: From Œ no, we were
 already by then in
 Pilzen
. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: 
Pilzen
, which was not too far from 
Prague. 
They  took us from 
Pilzen
 to 
Germany
, which was near mun Œ 
Q: Now this was the 
Joint
 that took you to  
Germany
? 
A: The 
Joint 
that was working with the 
American army because Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ because we were on an  American bus
. We didn™t ask any questions. You to ok 
it Œ you take us Œ we can™t Œ we™re getti
ng out, we don™t care. They said they™re 
taking us to 
Germany
, we™re going to 
Germany
, no matter where, because we 
were hoping that maybe from ther
e we will be able to go to 
Palestine
, because 
that™s was our idea that what
ever do Œ we do, we don™t wa
nt to stay in any other 
country, except go to 
Palestine
, because we already had bein
g in other countries. So 
that™s what we wanted to do, and the ne
xt thing we knew, we came into this, like 
what they called it later, displ
aced persons camp. It was called 
Foeh renwald
, which 
was near 
Wolfratshausen. 
It was like about 15 kilometers from 
Munich
. And it™s 
very interesting because later on I found out that 
Dach au
 was near 
Munich
 and 
actually my last transport they were ta
king us Œ we were supposed  to get to 
Dach au
. So I said, here I came on my 
free will, practically Œ not to 
Dach au
 but 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
30
almost, but I came differently. 
So we spent that time in 
Foehrenwald. Sam
 actually 
got a job, he was working in the office. It was run by the 
UNRRA
. Have you ever 
heard of
 UNRRA
? 
Q: Oh yes. 
A: You probably  did. 

Q: Sure. 

A: Yeah, okay. So he was wo
rking in the office, I got a 
job doing something and we 
got a house to Œ where we stayed, and whoe
ver came to that camp that was Œ that 

we knew, or was with Œ from my family or 
Sam™s
 family, they all came and they Œ 
we all stayed together in that house. So
 we wind up that my 
former brother-in-law 
came with his brother, and they  Œ 

Q: This is your sister™s husband? 

A: Yeah, my mun Œ 

Q: Your sister the dentist? 
A: Yeah, the one got Œ was kille
d. He survived and he came
 there, and he Œ he had a 
younger brother that surviv ed also, and 
he came and stayed with us, and then  
Sa m
 
had three, actually two cous
ins and then a young woman 
that was, I t h ink she was 
his cousin, but stayed all Œ we stayed all t
ogether in this house, and we cooked  and 
we Œ we did things, you know, together. So  
this wasn™t already 
too bad, because we 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
31
were able to have enough food Œ as a 
matter of fact, we we
re already getting too 
mu ch food, that you started 
worrying you might be
 getting too fat, because basically 
the food Œ and a lot of the fo
od we weren™t used to it, th
at Œ but like they gave us 
tuna fish, we never knew what tuna fish 
was, we™d Œ when  Œ 
we™ve never seen it. 
They  gave us powd ered milk, we never 
saw it. But later on, it™s amazing how you 
learn. I found out that if you mix the po
wdered milk, you Œ y
ou know, the powder 
with water, it becomes like milk
. So we made cheeses out of it. It™s amazing. We 
used to make delicious cheese.
 I wish I could get it now.  
Q: In your other interviews, you said that 
you were raised in an Orthodox religious 
home. 

A: Yeah, mm-hm 
Q: And before the war, c
ould you say something about 
what your religion was for 
you and what about after the war Œ 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Œ like wh en you were in this 
house with  all these other people. 
A: Mm-hm. Well, I will tell you, I was actual
ly Œ I was actually Œ I was raised in a 
fairly religious home. Everybody was al
most Orthodox in 
my city, but I was 
probably the most Orthodox 
in my family. I wouldn™t go to
 s Œ wh en I went to sleep 
I would leave in the f Œ in front of my 
bed a Œ a Œ a little pan with a Œ with water, 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
32
because when I got up the firs
t thing in the morn
ing when my eyes
 opened, I would 
wash my  hands and say a prayer th anking 
God for making me get up tha Œ to be 
able to be alive. So Œ 
Q: Did your parents encourag e that? 
A: Well they Œ they must ha
ve because they sent me to
 a Œ a religious type of 
school. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But I myself, I was very, ve
ry much into the religion. First of all, I had a teacher 
that was a Œ I was absolutely crazy about
 her and she happened to  be from that 
school. So I would like follow her. She infl
uenced me a lot. But of course, during 
the war a Œ you know, we™re keeping,
 you know, with  
Jews you keep 
ka shrut
, you 
know, it™s very important. And I will never fo
rget the first time 
when I came to live 
with my sister, and my sister knew how relig ious I was, she wanted to get me used 

to Œ a little bit to a Œ not to be so picky,
 you know, like it™s alri
ght to eat something 
else if you don™t have 
everything that it™s kosher. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And she tried to give me a piece of sala
mi, which I™m to this day a salami freak. 
I don™t eat it because I™m afraid of my c
holesterol, but I could live on salami. A nd 
when  I ate it, and all of a sudden I asked 
her, I said, how did Œ 
how did you get it? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
33
Did Œ I thought because in 
the city where she lived, I knew she couldn™t get it. I 
said, did you get it from home? Did my  pare
nts send it to you? Because she used to 
always get somebody to  get in touch with my
 parents and she was able to manage to 
do th is. And she said Œ I could see the mi
nute she started explaining to me, because 
she figured it™s time to get 
me used to it, when she sa
w how much I enjoyed it. She 
says, well, in Œ nota Œ the mi
nute she Œ she didn™t even  Œ 
Q: Did you know what it was 
when she gave it to you? 
A: No. 
Q: You didn™t. 

A: I didn™t, because at that time I p robably 
would have still would 
refuse to have it. 
But she wanted to show me that you can stay 
alive even if you eat it. I used to think 
if you eat something non-kosher that you di
e. So the minute she says we-ell, I said 
oh-oh. And no sooner did she say it, like 
everything came out of me, you know, I 
started throwing up. But of course, little 
by little I got used to what they fed me, 
believe me. That didn™t make 
any difference. So Œ but one
 thing I must say, I am, 
even to this day, I am not as religious as I used to be. I believe in God. I believe I 

am Œ I like to go to shul, 
we work for the s
ynagogue, you know, I believe very 
much in Jewish education 
for the children and you know
, for everybody. I worked 
at 
[indecipherable]
 for Œ I was instrumental in rais
ing quite a bit of money fo r the 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
34
Jewish Theo logical Seminary of 
America
 in
 New York
, because I was always 
interested in Jewish education. However, I 
am not as religious or adherent to the 
ka shrut,
 to being kosher as much as I was 
then. Because I found out that you can 
live and it doesn ™t have to be everythi
ng ex actly kosher. And Œ and besides, I 
my self Œ had maybe my  parents lived thro
ugh, I would have 
kept it on fo r them, 
because somehow older people stick much more
 to it. Even the survivors, the older 
survivors. But a lot of peop le like me that went throu
gh th e war, are not as Œ they  
believe in God, but they don™t believe that
 the Œ the meat has to be slaughtered a 
certain way in order to be a good Jew or
 something like this. 
So no, this they 
definitely changed me this way. But as fa
r, th ey couldn™t kill the spark for Judaism 
and I don™t know why it™s whether becauseI was so young that it really Œ like it, 
like went above me. I-It didn™t touch me as
 much. I always say, when you were a 
young kid, you don™t 
have the Œ the bonds with  your fami ly are not yet so comp lete 
that you can cope with Œ with these thi
ng a little bit better than let™s say, older 
people. I always say that had my  sister 
survived, let™s say you
 know, my sist er 
actually had a choice, you know
, she didn™t have to go w
ith her baby. They actually 
wanted her to say that this baby isn™t mine
. Because you see, they
 needed her in the 
Œ in the camp. They lik ed to staff the camp with the 
doctor, a dentist. By then, when 
they were taking my sister out, they ha
d killed off most of the doctors and the

dentists and whatnot. So th
ey  had to go lo ok for somebo
dy. So th ey actually didn™t 
want her to leave. They actually encouraged
 her to say no, this 
is not my  baby. But 
of course she wouldn™t do it. And you can 
imagine, if she woul
d survive a-and she 
had to live with something 
like this. I mean, you can™t do
 that. So as far as I w as 
concerned, it™s true I was raised very, 
you know, in a way you would have been  
Orthodox, but not to th e po
int where, like I have some
 Orthodox neighbors here. 
You know, they walk  around
 with their hats, and thei
r Œ you know, th-they call 
them the 
payos 
in Œ in Jewish, I don™t know Œ 
Q: Dreadlocks? 
A: What are they? 
Q: Dreadlocks? 
A: I don™t know whether it is the dreadlo
cks, but th-the kids, you know and th eir 
garment has these little things
 outside. And my father ne
ver wore anything like this, 
and Œ he used to wear a ha
t, but nothing id entifying hi
m as a Œ as being a Jew, 
because he could have 
wear only a hat, like anybody else, you know. 
Poland
 was 
pretty cold, so mo st of the time you had to 
wear a hat. But Œ and my  mo ther didn™t 
shave her head, she had her own hair. So we 
weren™t that strictly Orthodox, we were 
a fairly Orthodox. Like here, you wo
uld have considered us Orthodox. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
36
A: But now Œ but I was Orthodox, but I will 
tell you, th at™s Œ as I say, the only thing 
they killed in me, about the 
ka shrut
, but the rest of me, being Jewish and loving 
Judaism, this they couldn™t kill. 
Q: Tell me about loving Judaism. 
A: Tell you. You know what? I often think th
at if I had a choice, 
if they would have 
approached me Œ of course, I shouldn™t say 
this because it™s my thinking, you know, 

because I was never approached, but had 
I been approached to Œ that somebody 
would want to take me out an
d that™s all I had to do is 
take over another religion, I 
don™t think I would have
 done it. Now, I don™t say Œ I couldn™t swear to it, because I 
was never asked. Bu t I always felt very 
strong about being Je
wish. Even while I 
was in camp. You know, we had a incident in
 ones of the camps. It was right after 
Auschwitz
, I was in this camp, 
Bomlitz, 
maybe you find Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Now see, you know more 
about me than I do. I-In 
Bomlitz
 that Œ we were under 
Œ not under the 
SS, 
we were under the 
Wehrmacht, 
which is the military. And one 
day Œ and believe me, we didn™t know wh at 
holiday it was, but the same thing, they 
had this speech to us. We 
know that you have a big holiday today. It was Yom 
Kippur, where you fast, you don™t eat. And gu
ess what he told us? In the mo rning 
we used to get a portion of br
ead, he would say to us, you don™t have Œ if any of you 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
37
want to fast, you don™t have to take the pi
ece of bread now. We will give it to you in 
the evenin g. And we figured , you know we
 never trusted them. We figured  that 

they™ll probably never give us
 the bread. Bu t you want to
 know so mething? It was 
amazing, I would say th at 95 percent of the 
inmates in that camp
 chose not to take 
that piece of bread, once we knew that it 
was Yom Kippur. If th
ey had given it to 
us, we didn™t know that it was Yom Kipp
ur, but once we knew it Œ so you see, I 
think it wasn™t only me. I think most of us
 had this spirit. And I don™t know whether 
it was our Œ like self preservation or we felt 
like, you th ink so  great, look wh at you 
doing to  us. What am I gonna become, like you?
 I don™t want to be like you. So ee Œ 

I Œ ee Œ ing Œ I n Œ I would never, during the war, I never gave it through without 
mu ch thought, you know, I never thought of 
it, because I w Œ you know what I say? 
That only  free people have the luxury of th
inking. People that are enslaved the way 
we were actually enslaved, I don™t think 
sit around thinking about these things. 
Mostly what you th ought is about food. Gi
ve me some food, you
 know, to fill my 
stomach. So this is another 
thing. So I don™t know wh
ether I answered what you 
wanted to  Œ 
Q: Mm-hm, yes, you did. 
A: Œ to know or something. 
Q: Are Œ we™re skipping around here, but
 are mo st of your friends survivors? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
38
A: I would say probably  a large core of 
them, but I also have s Œ non-survivor 
friends. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: Because first of all it, I think a lots of
 times has to do with
 where you lived. We 
came to the 
United States
 and we came almost right away to 
Wa shington. 
Washin gton 
in those years, would you believe it, they wouldn™t let too many 
survivors even co
me then here. 
Q: To 
Washington? 
A: Yeah, because Œ as a matter of fact, 
my husband has this wo
nderful story. When 
we were in 
New York, 
they took him in Œ took us in an
d they were trying to talk to 
us. Why don™t you go to  the south? 
Q: No, who was this th
at took Œ took you in ? 
A: Yo Œ we came Œ th-the 
Joint. 
The
 HIAS
? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: 
HIAS
 and 
Joint. 
Q: Okay . 
A: There were, you know Œ 
Q: So th ey brought 
Œ helped you get from 
Foehrenwald 
to  Œ 
A: Well, we Œ w-we actually Œ

39
Q: Œ 
New York
? 
A: Œ yes. We Œ they  helped 
us, but we actually had papers
 to come to this country . 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Because Œ let me Œ  
Q: From 
Sam™s 
uncle, or Œ 
A: No, mine. 

Q: Your uncle. 
A: What had happened, when I came to 
Foehrenwald
, you know, all through the 
war, I never got sick, whether for whatever 
reason, I was never sick and I always do 
attribute my survival because I was such
 a healthy kid. But guess what? When I 
stopped running and wh en we came back to 
Foeh renwald
 to that displaced persons 
camp, I became very sick. Yeah, I don™
t know, I had something like a blood 
disorder. Something Œ as a matter of fact
, the only thing I reme mb er is begging 
them, cut off my arms, because my arms 
were just like burning up. They  gave me 
some kind of medicine that 
mu st have had some kind of
 reaction. And th is docto r 
came, too, who was in this Œ actually 
he was with the American army and the 
C.I.A.
 and Œ but he was a Œ a doctor from 
Germany
. You know, he was Œ his Œ his 
birth was from 
Germany
. So  he was going around to  ho
spitals, he was a very fine 
man and di Œ to visit the pa
tients. So he came  Œ wh en 
he came near my  bed, he 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

handed me a Œ a candy bar. I said no. He 
said you don™t want? Can I do anything fo r 
you, he asked me in German. I said yes, 
you could, you could 
find me Œ I have an 
uncle that lives in 
New York,
 which I called
 Nev York
, in ma-my Œ I remember my 
mother used to always talk 
about her brother who lived  in 
New York.
 So I said, if 
you could find him for me, that
 would be great. So he 
got the name and would you 
believe that this guy put an ad in the 
Forwards,
 in the Jewish paper and looking Œ 
telling that a niece is looking for a Mr. Sa --
 Ze i s m a n n
(ph) 
Kreps
(ph). Well, my 
uncle never read the 
Forwards
, because he read the 
ﬁWall Street Journal.ﬂ
 Bu t 
there was somebody here in 
Washington
 that knew my mother, she was also from
 
Radom
, that came here before the war. She 
knew ma-my mother and sh e knew my 
uncle and she called him to 
New York
 to say, did you see a niece is looking fo r 
you? And he was the one that send me pape
rs to come, and my papers were made 

out not only for me, they were made out 
wh oever is with me, because my  uncle 
figured that if I survived, maybe there 
was somebody else that survived. But of 
course, nobody else survived , so I Œ I alwa ys tell him, you know, when I talk to the 

kids, they get a bang out of this, I tell 
them, y ou know, I tu
rned  around to  my  
boyfriend, I said, if you marry me, 
you know you have
 a ticket to the 
United States
 
and never Œ nobody ever refuses that. And 
they think that™s very funny, but that 
wasn™t it, but you know, I had the 
papers and I was able to bring 
Sam
 with me. So 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
41
we c-came, actually, from the pape
rs that my  uncle sent, but the 
HIAS 
really took 
care of us. They saw to it that we got in li
ne to get to the ship
, you know, because it 
was very terrible that time, you know, 
they  only allowed a certain amount of 
people. The Œ the immi gration laws were very
, very strict in this country. You had 
to go through Œ I mean, like your health
 and everything. If you were running a little 
bit, a grade over, one grade over a fever, 
one point over what they  thought it™s 
supposed to be, you were sent back
. And nobody wanted to stay in 
Germany
. I was 
sitting in 
Germany
 just waiting and Œ and the little su
itcase what I had, just didn™t 
want to even unpack. I Œ I was just ready 
to go because I star
ted telling you, we 
were hoping to go to
 Palestine
, but in those years Œ you still have time? 
Q: Yes. 

A: In those years you couldn™t go in to 
Palestine
 because they had the Œ the British 
put up a blockade so you coul
dn™t bring in the refugees, the only ones they had to 
smuggle them through. So once I got married, they figured we are already taken 
care of, you know, the Œ the Œ the people from 
Palestine
 that were taking care, they 
tried to take in the kids that had nobody, 
that they were single.
 So to  give them a 
life. So Œ and since we were married and 
of course by then we had already the 
papers to come to the 
United States
, so they let us alone and they  said no, we can™t

go, so we figured we™ll come to the 
United States
. Anything to get out from Œ from 
Germany
. 
Q: Let™s um Œ  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ stop here.

United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Reg i na  Spieg el
, tape two, side
 A. 
When  did you 
and 
Sam 
get married? 
A: We got married actually in May 21
st
, 1946.  
Q: And when did you come to the 
United States
? 
A: We came in Œ to the 
United States
 in November of 1947. 
Q: So you™d been  married a year and a half. 
A: Mm-hm, yeah. 

Q: Now prev iously you said that you and 
Sam
 wanted to go to 
Palestine. 
How did 
you feel that it was working out more easily
 and practically that
 you come to the 
United States
? 

A: Because, you know, you learn to compromi
se. We really wanted
 to come to Œ to 
go to
 Palestine
, because like I told you before, 
we figured we™ve had enough of 
different countries where i-if they decide 
they don™t like us, they can say go. So  we 
figured we™ll go to 
Palestine
, but since it became very difficult for us to go, they 
absolutely told us
 no way that we will be able to 
go because first of all, we were 
getting already, little by little, as time went
 on, we were getting older. We™d gotten 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

marry Œ we were married. We Œ they tried 
to take care of people more that were 
single. Single people, mo st of the time, 
unless you had family maybe, and if Œ 
Q: So they were not making 
it so easy for you, but how 
did you feel not to get to 
Palestine
? 
A: I-In the beginning we 
felt very badly. We Œ in the be
ginning. But once, I will tell 
you, once we knew that we™re coming 
here, as long as we were leaving 
Germ any
, 
that was our way to say we™re 
[indecipherable].
 And once we came to this country  
and I-I will tell you, I fell in love with this
 country . From the first minute I stepped 
off, I take my foot off the boat, th Œ it Œ 
most people were very kind, and we came 
to 
Wash ington
 almost right away. 
Q: Now, did 
HIAS
 encourage you to come to 
Wa sh ingto n
 and help you arrange 
that? 
A: No, because origina
lly, I start to tell you Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ orig inally no, they  didn't want to, bu
t my uncle suggested th
at we should go to  
Washin gton. 
And besides, you see, I had 
a brother that I Œ lived in 
Washin gton. 
Q: When  did you first learn that you had a brother in 
Washington? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
45
A: It Œ we™ll, when Œ when we were star
ted to work  Œ after, when we got back to 
Germany
, in the end of 1945. See, my  brothe
r was in the ar Œ in the American 
army, and Œ 
Q: Oh, he had come over a long time before. 
A: He came Œ he smuggled  himself into 
this country in 1939. And when  the 
United 
States
 declared war, he became Œ he fought in
 the American army. So after the war, 
they shipped him back to the 
United States
. But he found out that one of his sisters 
was alive, he didn™t know wh ich one, and he
 came back. He had e-enlisted back into 
the army as a translator becau se by Œ he spoke German a
nd by then he already knew 
English. So they shipped him back to 
Germany
, and that™s when he came back. We 
actually would have gotten ma
rried a little bit before, but 
when I heard that he was 
coming back to 
Germany
, I said I wanted to have my
 brother at my wedding. And 
we actually have a picture of my  brothe
r at our wedding. But he has passed away 

since then. He passed away a
bout 10 years ago. He was my  oldest brother. So  I did 
find out, and he lived  at 
[indecipherable]
 in Œ in the 
Wa sh ing t on
 area. So when Œ 
it was actually the 
Joint
 and the
 HIAS
 wanted to send us south, and wh en th ey 
informed 
Sa m
 th at they sending us south, he 
said, I™m n o t going south. I came to 
live in the 
America
, I™m not going south. He thought it was 
South America
 or 
something like this. So we ju
st, on our own, we left th-the

tell us to go there, but we decided Œ he pick ed  himself up, he came to 
Wash ington
, 
got in touch with so mebody, also through the 
Joint
 here, di Œ like Jewish Social 
Services, and they took him someplace. He
 got a job right away, came back, picked 
me up, and we came to 
Washington
 and he already was Œ ha
d a job, work ing. He Œ 
we came in Œ w-we weren™t here three da
ys, he had a job alr
eady, was making 40 
dollars a week, so we were 
Œ were in good shape.  
Q: So, did he speak E
nglish when  you came? 
A: No, no. He got a job with so mebody 
that was from the Italian German border, 
and the guy spoke a little b
it German, so they were ab
le to understand each other. 
Q: And did you speak English? 
A: No. 
Q: So what was that like
 for you, a young bride Œ  
A: In the beginning we started going to
 Americanization school. In th e beginning 

was very hard, but I will tell you th at you 
always used to find either some people 
that they spoke Jewish, you sp
eak Yiddish, so the Œ and Œ 
Q: You speak Yiddish? 

A: Yeah, mm-hm, and so does my  husband. 
And he speaks Œ actually he speaks a 
little bit Hebrew, much better than I. And di
 Œ I don™t speak Hebrew, I know how to 
read Hebrew  because I was taught Hebrew
 like for a Œ for praying. But we came 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
47
here and we got even  a room with a Germ
an family, a Jewish German family . So 
right away we were able to converse with
 them in German. So Œ because at that 
time we still spoke a little bit German, now 
our Œ my German is very rusty. I still 
speak a little bit, but in those years we were
 still much better at it. So we were able 
to converse with her and sh e would tell us
 where to go to the grocery to shop or 
something like this. So we manage a
nd little by little you Œ you know what? What 
happens to you wh en  you Œ 
wh en you Œ wh en you have 
to. I think almost within 
three months, I started speaking English, 
so to  make my self understood. I mean, I 
didn™t speak like I speak now,
 but I was able to make my
self understand, and so did 
Sam
. 
Q: What language do you and 
Sam 
speak together now? 
A: Together, English. 
Q: English? 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: When  did you make that switch? 
A: I don™t know, it came so naturally. It 
came because when we started going to 
school Œ you see, and that™s what I star
ted telling you before
 when  you ask me 
whether most of my friends are survivors 
a-and Œ you see, it all depends wh ere you 
live. If you lived in 
na Œ an area like 
New York
, where there were a lot of 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
48
survivors, you didn™t have to learn to sp
eak English, because yo
u could get along on 
Yiddish Œ on Jewish, because mo-most of th
e people that had the little businesses or 
whatever, you got a job, they
 were speaking Jewish. And 
the survivors that you met 
together, you Œ they  were speaking Jewish
 or Polish. So  we really didn™t Œ they 
didn™t need it. But here in 
Washington, 
because we had very few survivors in this 
area that™s came from Œ spoke Po
lish, you know, so we di 
Œ really, we™re like forced 
to Œ to Œ y-you have to lear
n or Œ or sink. And we did.
 A-And we didn™t like Œ I bet 
you it didn™t take us less than six months
 that we were able to make ourselves 
understood. And mo st people, that™s why I 
always say that the American people are 
so wonderful, you know, esp
ecially in those years. I will tell you i-i Œ later on I was 
thinking to my self how Œ you know, my  E
nglish was so bad and yet they tried so 
hard. They wouldn™t 
[indeciphera ble]
 from me or anything like that, a-and they 

tried so hard to like stop and listen to me 
what I had to tell them or something, you 
know. So i-it Œ it really  was a pretty Œ as far as I was concerned, a very pleasant 
experience. You see, you have to  realize, 
it™s one thing wh en you come to a country 
when  you leave your family at home. You 
miss them, let™s face it. If I would have 
had my  whole family in powl Œ 
Poland
, and I would have come
 here, I was a young 
woman an d so was my  husband, I would have
 found it, very probab ly, disturbing. 
But coming from where we ca
me, with nobody, I had nothi
ng to look back to.  

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
49
Q: Did you think a lot abou
t wh at you had come from?  
A: All the time. And you want
 to know something Œ but 
it was interesting to hear 
once my kids telling me the same thing, wh
at I always thought it™s Œ you know, the 
minute the war was over, I almost became b ack like this little gi
rl, except minus the 
ka shrut
, this little girl that left home Œ that
 was taken from home, that I was forced 
out of from home. I-It was always, whatever 
I did, it was always as if my parents, 
especially my mother, as if
 she was standing in the back of me and like guiding me. 
And saying no, you Œ you shou
ldn™t do that, or yes, you could do that. And it was 
interesting, so help me, I™m not making th
is up, but my  daughter, I have three girls 
and my middle one was always like a little b it of a rebel. And she had gone to
 
Israel
 for Œ you know, like for a summer pack
age deal for five weeks. And she 
came back and you know, I started asking
 her question, what did you do or 
something, but she says, Mother, you don™
t have to worry, it was always Œ while I 
was in 
Israel
, it was always as if you 
were standing right in the back of me, so help 
me. And I said to my  Œ you know, I don™
t know, is that™s how life goes on, the 
cycle? I said, you know what? That™s how 
I was thinking when
 I was without my 
parents. I was thinking that th
ey were in the back of me. 
Q: So what kinds of things was your mo ther telling you? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
50
A: It wasn™t a question what she was te
lling me, It was a question what you were 
learning from Œ from them, what they were
 doing. You always knew  that you 
shouldn™t harm anybody, that
 you Œ you should be kind to
 other people. You always 
knew that cert Œ certain things you just didn
™t do. Sh e didn't have to spell it out to 
me. I mean, I knew what was expected of me
. She didn™t just sit me down on my Œ 
on my  Œ wh ich, I used to sit on her lap a 
lot because I was the youngest one in my  
family, so Œ a-and sh e used to like how a 
Œ I was 13 years old, I rememb er she used 
to keep me Œ wh en she hold me on her lap like Œ like I do so metimes with my  
grandson who is three or five years old. 
One five, and one three. I™m just saying. 
But she kept me like Œ almost like a ba
by, you know. But I al
way s rememb er my  
mo ther as being the kindest person that
 ever lived. And y
ou want kn-kn-know 

something? If I should have any legacy, even
 to my  children, I always think of it, 

my  children should rememb er me the way I 
reme mb er my  mo th e
r. But of course I 
lived much longer, so
 they probably might not, you kn
ow, because Œ you know, as a 
child you Œ I mean, how much
 harm could I do? But I-I had certain values that I 
knew that I mu stn™t overstep. A Œ in Œ like 
a Œ a living with a Œ with a boyfriend, I 
knew that was wrong and 
you just don™t do it.  
Q: So, was that hard for you when you only had 
Sa m 
and you didn™t have anyone 
else?

Œ you know, even befo
re we got legally 
married, we did get Œ like, because we we
re togeth er, we did get Œ I Œ finally I 
admitted it to my children, 
you know, because we did ge
t together, but you see, 
when  we were in his hometown, 
Kozienice
, there was no rabbi, there were only a 
couple Jewish families. We to
ok them together and we to
ld it to them that we are 
getting like married in our own way, not with
 any ceremonies or anything like that, 
but they knew that we Œ 
Q: So you had witnesses? 
A: Yes, okay, witnesses.  

Q: You had witnesses for your commitment.  
A: Exactly, exactly, that™s what 
[indeciphera ble]
 thank you. Next time when I™m 
asked this question, I™ll be able to say th
at, because I could never figure out what I 
should call that. But they Œ as a matter of 
fact, one of his cousins who later on went 
to
 Belgium
 was one of them, you know, she and 
her husband. That was Œ and Œ and 
there was another couple. And, you know, w
ith the Jews you need to have at least 
10 people, you know, but we
 didn™t have. So we, like you said, they were our 
witnesses for a two hour 
commitment. And then Œ 
Q: Did you have any kind 
of prayer associated with meeting with them?

A: Not Œ n-not Œ not at that time, not at th
at time, but later on, wh en we decided to 
do get married in 
[indecipherable]
 in the displaced persons camp Œ because you 
see, while we™re struggling around still in 
Poland, 
it was very hard to do that 
because we were constantly 
thinking that we™re not going 
to stay there, definitely, 
because if not 
[indecipherable] Sam 
definitely would have 
gotten killed, because 
we even heard that somebody was trying 
to do th at. Somebodywarned us, and we 
knew we had to get aw ay from th
ere. And then, when we got to
 Germany, 
but then  
heard that my brother was coming, so I 
told my husband Œ b
ecause I could have 
gotten Œ we had plenty w
itnesses in the Œ in the 
Foehrenwald
, in the displaced 
persons camp , but I said 
Sam
, how can I get married? I-I have only one brother. I 
have to wait for him. So that™s why we 
waited a little bit longe
r, but we could have 
gotten, actually, in a way Œ I always tell my 
kids, i-i-it Œ it took years til I told them 
that that™s what we did, b
ecause after all, we were trav
eling together and we Œ we 
didn™t get hote Œ different hotel rooms, yo
u know, so to speak. Bu t yes, I did have 
my values I took from my fam
ily, and all these things that 
til this day, all the things 
that we worked for, like Je
wish education, because it was very important in our 
family. Any kind of education, but especial
ly Jewish. And the charity. We were not 
rich people, but my Œ I re
member my mother always saying, there™s always 
somebody th at has less than you, so therefor
e we have to  save something to give it

to them, too. And always was that, always st
ressed, be Œ be nice to other people, be 
kind to other people. Try to
 do the best with wh at you™ve got. And of course I 
always used to say, I never knew I was 
poor because nobody ever told me.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It™s Œ a matter of fact, i-in school wh en
 I went to school, I was one of the kids 
that used to be dressed very nicely, a
nd you know why? Becaus
e we were uni Œ we 
were used to wearing uniforms, little like t
ype of Œ like type of 
th-things and like an 
apron, you know. And my  mo ther used 
to make it for me. She was a wonderful 
seamstress. So I had really th
ings that were nicer even than maybe some Œ a lot of 
rich kids, you know. But I always used to sa
y that a Œ a Œ nobody 
ever told me I was 
poor, so I never knew it. 

Q: Tell me what it was like 
for you to have ch ildren. 
A: It was wonderful. It really was w
onderful. I Œ it took me a little while, not 
because Œ first of all, I knew I didn
't want to have any children in 
Germany
, so I 
waited til I came to the 
United States
. And then Œ by then, 
I wanted to learn to 
speak English, to be able to, you know, talk
 to my kids. So then
 I Œ when  I had th Œ 
I finally had Œ my  oldest daughter 
was born in Œ in August of ™51. 
Q: So you™d been  here how long? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
54
A: I was here almo st four years, you know
, in Au gust ™51 and I was actually four 
years here. I wa Œ  
Q: Did you work  before your daughter was born? 
A: Yes, uh-huh, I wo r Œ or wo rk ed as a se
amstress. I knew how to
 sew enough to do 
work in Œ not in 
that camp, not in 
Foeh renwald
. Later on, when we left the Œ the 
displaced persons camp, after we got marri
ed and my br Œ wh
en my brother was 
there, he got a girlfrien d from
 Stuttgart
 and it was too hard for him to come Œ to go 
to 
Stuttgart
 and to go to visit me. So he was to
rn between. So  we decided to leave 
the displaced persons 
camp and we 
moved to 
Stuttgart
. And while in 
Stuttgart
 
they had the Œ what it™s called Œ it™s a 
very worthwhile organization, it™s called
 
ORT. 
They teach you how to make a living. 
They teach you how to use skills. It™s 
really wonderful. It Œ actually 
ORT
 is doing this kind of
 wo rk now all over the 
world, not just for Jews because now Jews
 go to colleges and th
ey Œ they™re what Œ 
Q: So it™s like a trade school. 

A: Exactly. And I learned really to sew ov
er there. I mean, I always knew how to 
sew because I told you, my
 mother was a seamstress and we always ar Œ had a 
machine, a sewing machine at home, and I 
always say ar Œ I used to be br Œ I 
probably got born 
with a needle in my  hand, becaus
e I always liked to sew, and so 
when  I came over to this country  and I wanted
 to get a job, naturally I Œ as a ma tter

of fact when I came to 
New York
 and I met my  uncle, and it™s interesting, because 
when  my  uncle came to pick us up and 
he was looking around, 
you know, we were 
Œ wh en we got off the ship an
d we were in Œ in this big 
hall with Œ there must have 
been thousands of people, I 
picked out my uncle. I ne
ver saw him alive. The man 
looked ex actly around his eyes like my  mo
ther. I said, that must be him. I never 
even saw a picture of him Œ I didn™t rememb
er. I™m sure I must ha
ve seen it, but you 
know, a kid looks at a picture 
of some uncle that lives in 
New York
 that she never 
saw, didn™t pay any attention.
 But I picked him out. I walk
ed over to him, and sure 
enough it was my  uncle. But my  uncle was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in  
Manhattan
. Had one of the finest tailor shops in 
Ma nha ttan
, he and a partner. 
They used to make clothing for 
J. Edgar Hoover
. I mean, in those years when we 
came over to this country, my
 uncle™s suits used to cost
 like about f Œ between 500 
and seven - 800 dollars. I mean, unbelievabl
e. Everything was handmade. So wh en 
I came Œ and of course I found my  uncle, 
he sh owed me how to use an electric 
sewing machine, I never used it. So when I came to 
Washington,
 I already knew 
how to use an electric sewing machine, so 
I knew, so I actually got a job right away 
at that place here, and then I switched to 
another place and I worked til my daughter 
was almo st born.

Q: Do you know the book
 by th e daughter of a ref
ugee from a survivor from 
Czechoslovakia
 and the daughter Œ it came o u t a co
uple of years ago Œ the daughter 
wanted to trace her ancestors in 
Czechoslovakia
 and trace them through her 
mother™s clients. 
A: Did Œ did she just recently write this book, or Œ 

Q: Yes. 

A: Is that by 
Helen
 Œ 
Q: Yes, 
Helen 
somebody. 
A: Œ 
Helen Epstein
? 
Q: Yes, that™s the one. 
A: Okay , okay, I will tell you. I ha
ve a little bit an argument with 
Helen Epstein
, I 
should 
[indecipherable]
. I mean I Œ I argue with her in
 my  heart, not in a Œ when 
her first book came out, I really felt ve Œ offended. 
Q: I Œ I Œ I heard her sp eak about the book I mention Œ 
A: Lately, lately Œ 
Q: Yeah, what was the ba Œ I Œ 

A: This other book Œ 
Q: Œ wh at was the first book ab out, I can™t Œ don™t rememb er. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

A: The book Œ the first b
ook what she wrote, she 
wrote something about how 
children of survivors are messed up kids. 
Q: Oh. 
A: You know, they really Œ 
Q: Yeah, I remember. 

A: Œ they  have big problems. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: They Œ you know, and I wa
s thinking to my self Œ by then I was already older. 
My kids, thanks God I have 
three daughters that weren™
t messed up. All right, so 
maybe somebody needs a little 
bit of a psychiatrist, who 
doesn ™t? I Œ I have friends 
that were American born and they have pr
oblems with children. I mean, you Œ you 
can™t put that he Œ I hate when people lik
e put me in a Œ in a category. I figured I 
had it already. You know, I went throug
h the category. I was Jewish, I was a 
woman, I wasn™t old enough to
 go in into Œ into the ca
mp , I had to  have different 
papers, my Œ I mean, I Œ I was already put 
into so many categories, I didn 't like to 
be. So I wer Œ resented her. But because I 
felt like, if you want 
to write about your 
own life, it™s fine. Maybe you have a pr
oblem with your mother, or whatever, 
you™re entitled to it. But don™t say that a
ll the survivors™ kids Œ because when you 
look around, it™s just t h e oppo
site, to the contrary. I thin
k survivors™ kids are very 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
58
well adjusted kids. They Œ they ™ve done wo
nders. Or okay, maybe we helped  them 
a little bit, but you can™t help a kid unless th
ey can help themselv
es. They all Œ most 
of them are professionals, or if th ey are 
not, they do so mething, th ey™re really very 
worthwhile citizens. A nd the way she put in 
that book Œ but this
 book that she went 
on th is journey, I think she mu st have come to terms with her mo ther or whatev er, 
because she went to find from where she 
came and she found out that her mother 
wasn™t such a horrible person, and she made
 that up, that she was, in her mind she 
assumed that because her mother, you know,
 maybe didn™t do certain things for her, 
that she figured all the kids of surviv
ors are no good. So I had a little bit of a 
problem, but no, I Œ as a matter of fact, I 
would love to  get ahold of that book. They  
Œ they had a write-up about this bo
ok in one of the Œ I think maybe 
ﬁNewsweekﬂ
 
magazine or in one of them. And I read it,
 but there wasn™t so much written, but I 
always wanted to get this book out and 
read ab out it, because for the only reason 
that I wanted to read it, because I 
wanted to change my mind about this 
Helen 
Epstein
. So this Œ I had my own little beef w
ith her, that I felt like, don™t put all 
survivors there, just like I™m not going to  put
 that all su rvivors get a ba Œ as a matter 
of fact, I think th e survivors™ kids tried so mu ch hard er. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
59
A: Because they knew 
like we went through a lot, so 
they tried to make our life a 
little bit easier. I mean, I find it so Œ I Œ I 
used to re-resent th
is kind of thing. 
Q: Do you find that a lot, that
 you are put into a category? 
A: Not any mo re, but we Œ in a way, we 
used to be. You know, I never Œ you see, 
here again, I thi
nk because I lived in
 Wa sh ingto n
 and because I had different 
friends, I was exposed to different friends 
and I Œ also I will tell you, I have two 
cousins here. Well, one passed away. Bu t I 
had two wonderful cousins. My mo ther, 
apparently , this brother that lived in
 New York
, had another brother who lived  in 
Washin gton.
 And he passed away, but he left o
ffsprings. So he 
had tw o daughters 
and three boys. It d Œ th e 
others lived in Œ one in 
Baltimore
, in different places and 
with the boys I never got that close, only on
e. But with the two 
women, the cousins, 
I became very friendly, we became like a 
family. As a matter of fact, I have my 
cousin™s daughter, who is my  second cousin
, is like the best c
ousin I™ve ever ha Œ 
you know, really, she™s just 
wonderful. And we keep so 
much, so maybe my family, 
in a way, were very nice to us. I think 
some survivors experien
ce a little bit like this, 
oh you went through wh at yo
u went through, maybe it was a lot your fault. You 
know, it Œ some people lo
oked at it that way Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
60
A: Œ in the beginning Œ I™m not saying now,
 before people found out wh at had gone 
Œ was going on. And Œ but my  family was ve
ry nice to us. They  accepted us the way 
we were, with our broken English, and ma
ybe that helped me 
a little bit look on 
things with a little b
it rosier glasses. And I had wo
nderful friends. Not only the 
survivors, the others. I-I had some very in
telligent friends. As a matter of fact one 
just left for 
Hungary
 and Œ and she lives in
 Austin, Texas
 now and sh e just left for 
Czechoslovakia
 an d
 Hungary.
 And she called me before sh
e left, she wanted me to 
know, because she knew that I 
will enjoy hearing from her, th
at she is going to visit 
these two countries that had 
such also tragedy, you know , with the Jewish people. 
And some others, very inter Œ I used to al
ways like oh, I had one friend, she Œ they 
live now in 
Florida.
 And I used to always say, oh 
Mildred
, I wish I was intelligent 
as you are, as educated. She says, 
Regina
, you™ve got mo re education, in a way, 
that any of us could ever ge
t. You have life education. 
You we Œ I Œ I listen to you 
sometimes when you talk
. I like to hear and I like to take your 
[indecipherable]
 
advice, because you Œ we always know that
 you won™t steer us 
the wrong way. So 
don™t look at it that way. Th
ink of yourself that you ar
e very important. So th ey 
always try to build me up, but it wa Œ so 
maybe that™s why I always had a little bit a 
Œ a better outlook on th ings, because I thi
nk when you being, you know, all right, 
we were kicked around plenty ee Œ oh Œ in 
Europe,
 over there. But when I came 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
61
here and I wasn™t kept on be
ing kicked around, I kind 
of like Œ it was almost like 
my  healing process. So I figured hey, I be
long back to the human
 race, or something 
like this. 
Q: How do you take 
the situation over in 
Yugoslavia
 currently? 
A: Mm-hm, well, it™s Œ for aw
hile there, you know, I th
ought oh my 
goodness, the 
world just sitting back and doing nothing.
 But I will tell you, the way I look at it 
now, I Œ that the world has learned a little b
it from us. It™s true that we paid a very, 
very big price, because let™s 
face it, nobody, nobody gave us
 a hand or anything. It™s 
a matter of fact, not only didn™t they give
 us a hand, they  put stumbling blocks, you 
know, in our way. No Œ a Œ I told you we were Œ we we
re rescued by Œ by railroad 
tracks that were broken . They could 
have done that, the same thing in 
Auschwitz
. 
Like we used to sit in 
Auschwitz
 and think of it when we would see a plane fly by, 
we would say, why can™t they send a pl
ane and ju st drop a couple bombs? Not on 
us, we didn™t want to get killed, but just 
on the railroad tracks, 
to slow them down. 
Just slow them down. But never happened. So  I feel that the world, in a way, has 
learned a little bit 
[indecipherable]
. But it also, as bad as it is, and believe me, no 
matter what child gets killed, for whatever
 reason, it doesn™t ma
ke any different, it™s 
still somebody™s child that it™
s killed and it Œ no reason
. But you know, in Œ in 
Yugoslavia
 it was a co mpletely different story. 
People wanted terr
itory. They wa Œ 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
62
they wanted Œ but with us 
they didn™t gain that they 
have Œ if they killed those 
people they will gain something. With us, th
ey Œ they wi Œ had no
 gain with us. The 
only gain  they got that maybe they Œ they  
stole some pictures or some art or some 
money or something like this. But basically
 by Œ by displacing us, 
or killing us, they 
didn™t gain anything by it, 
it was just for the sake of k
illing. But of course, I don™t Œ 
you know, I don™t like to s
ee what it™s going on th ere. 
Q: Just Œ do you think more about what 
happened to you during this period? Wh at 
everything Œ 
A: Well, when I Œ when I 
see in the paper I always Œ I kind of compare how 
everybody™s aware what™s going  on there, as compared 
to those years that nobody 
supposed ly knew wh at was going on ex cept 
in the high hierarc
hy, you know. But 
the ee Œ ee Œ I™m always concerned what wa
s go Œ what™s going on in this world. I 
think it™s Œ it™s Œ i Œ the minute it affects a
ny human being, it affects me too, to a 
certain degree. But as far as do I remember
 mo re what had happ
ened to me when I 
see this? N o , because I always 
Œ they don™t have Œ they do
n™t have to do that mussel 
Œ wh at™s his name? The guy Œ 

Q: 
Milosevic.
 
A: 
Milosevic
 doesn™t have to do it for me to 
remind me, because I remember what 
go Œ went on with 
us all the time. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

Q: All the time? 
A: All the time. 

Q: So it™s always somewhere in your mind. 
A: Oh, there™s no question about that. 
I can be, you know, dancing away and 
something and all of a sudden my  
[indecipherable]
 I will think, wouldn™t that be 
wonderful if our parents coul
d be here. Or in, you know Œ 
Q: Wouldn™t it be wonderful if what? 

A: If our parents could be here. 
Q: Oh. 

A: You know, just to see,
 you know, like when  we have a Œ when  my  kids got 
wedding Œ were getting married a
nd when  my  grandchildren had 
Ba r 
or 
Ba t 
Mitzvahs
, you know? Would have been so wo nd
erful but for the gr
andparent to be 
able to come to
 their child™s 
Bar Mitzvah
 or 
Bat Mitzvah
. My sister actually Œ you 
know wh en Œ wh en she knew th at she was pregnant, she made up her mind that is 
she is going to have a little boy Œ you know, 
in those years they didn™t know ahead 
of time. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: She was not going to  circumcise
 him, because circumcision was in 
Poland
 was 
mainly done by Jews. Not Œ the Polish ki
ds were not circumcised. But you know 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

64
what, wh en the baby was born, she couldn™t
 bring herself to do that. That™s when 
you ask me how did you th ink,
 you know. Look my  sister and she was older and sh e 
might have known th at we™re into mu ch mo
re trouble than I did. Sh Œ wh en I saw 
what she Œ she is preparing 
to have the baby circumcise
, I said you said you Œ if 
we™re gonna Œ if you™re go
nna have a little b oy that you™re not gonna do it. She 
says, I can™t do it. She Œ it™s for Œ it was my
 parents™ first grandchild. She says, I 
can™t to it. And they couldn™t 
even come to the city becaus
e they were already in the 
ghetto in  
Ra do m
 and they couldn™t come. But she 
still couldn™t bri
ng herself to do 
something against my parents™ wishes. I 
don™t say look, I-I-I™m not going to say had 
she known what™s going to ha
ppen really that she had Œ 
wouldn™t have done it, but 
at the time, she knew maybe that it™s gon
na be dangerous, but she figured  she™s 
gotta cope with it.

Spiegel,
 I changed the subject when you star
ted to talk abou
t your children and 
what it was like for you to have ch ildren an d grandchildren. 
A: Mm-hm, well to have my children, it wa
s really a wonderful feeling. All of a 
sudden I realize that w h at
 he started out to do, 
Hitler
, he wanted to really eliminate 
the Jews, and here were two 
survivors, we have three wonderful daughters, they™re 

married and we have eight gran dchildren. A
nd this is our really immortal less Œ like 
our revenge to 
Hitler
. You wanted to do away  w
ith us. Look, we™re here. And 
they™re all going into Œ you know, let™s put 
it this way, I™m very proud of my  kids. 
They are going in the footst
eps, so to speak, of thei
r forefathers. You know, like 
they™re all very active in organizational wo
rk, do a lot of Œ for their synagogues. My 
son-in-law and my daughter practically
 built their synagogue on their own in 
Columbia, Maryland
. My daughter in 
Tucson, Arizona
 is very active with her 
husband in her synagogue, and a lot of ot
her organizations. So th is Œ regardless 
what I have done, wh en I see my  kids ar
e doing th at, I figure I can take it easy. So 
in a way, by watching us through the year
s, they Œ you know, 
they picked up our 
lead and they doing that Œ this. And I my
self, you know, I work at Œ as a volunteer 
at the museum and I™ve been asked lots 
of times, how Œ how can you work  here? I 
mean, especially what you have gone thro
ugh, to sit here? And I said, you know 
what? This museum was really not built fo
r me, because I carry
 the museum with 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
66
me all the time. It was built, really, for ot
her people to learn what had gone Œ what 
had gone on, and hopefully that they gonn
a learn something from it. And as far as 
I™m concerned, I always say when  they as
k me how can you work there, I said, how 
can I not? To me it™s almost my life. I wo
rk for the museum, I give money to the 
museum. I mean, it™s very important for me to
 Œ the mu seum should 
be in existence.  
Q: When  did you begin work ing at the mu seum? 
A: I started  working for the museum way 
before the museum was built, when it was 
still Œ the offices they had on 
Ell
(ph) Street, I used to go 
whenever they had some 
people that wanted to learn a little bit mo
re about it and to raise, which in the 
beginning was really mo stly raising mone
y, because how do you put up this 
build ing? By  raising money because they go
t the land for the Œ for the to Œ the land 
where to put it on, but to put 
it on cost a lot of money.  
Q: So you were activ
e in raising money? 
A: Abso lutely. It™s a Œ  it™s Œ matter of fact
, my little co usin that I told you, she and I 
had a, in my home, right here, a Œ a what 
they called it, a parlor meeting, wh ere you 
invite a lot of friends and relatives and 
of course, you ask them for money. And we 
raised money through this way.

museum. So we worked for 
the mu seum way, way befo re the mu seum was even in 
existence. 
Q: And how did you and th
e mu seum know about each other befo re it was in 
existence so that you got started Œ 

A: You know, it™s Œ it™s only work them out. 
First of all, I™m also active in the 
Jewish Œ the Jewish Holocaust Su
rvivors and Friends of Greater
 Washington.
 We 
have an organization here and as a matter 
of fact when the mu seum was opened, I 
was president of that organization. Now I™m 
an officer, but we have a group th at we 
keep up th is organization, and 
th -they Œ if you™re interested
 and if you know that we 
can help you out a little bit, 
you find us. And th-they fou
nd us. They Œ they Œ they 
knew about us and th ey got in touch with 
us and so we spoke on their behalf. And 
to this day I still do and that Œ as yo
u know, my job is w
ith the development 
department. I still raise money.  

Q: Now what do you do now with
 the development department? 
A: Yeah, development department is Œ I Œ I am on the for me mb ership and 

donation. I sit at the desk and hopefully Œ 

Q: This is the desk on 
the fir Œ ground floor. 
A: On th e ground floor next to the Œ the 
visitors Œ you know, wh ere people ask the 
information. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So i-if you come to the desk what a Œ 
you Œ I try to tell you a little bit about it, to 
let you know wh at the mu seum does. And most
 of the time if you come to the desk 
we™ll hope that you gonna leave us some mo
ney. And we try to Œ you know, to help 
you along to understand why you should le
ave some mo ney, why it™s so important 
for the museum to stay open. 

Q: And how often do yo
u wo rk  at the desk? 
A: Well, you see that Œ okay, I work at the desk one Œ one day a week . 

Q: A full day or a half day? 

A: Yes, a full day.  
Q: A full day. 
A: I come in 10 o™clock and I li Œ leave ab
out four. But I also 
work in Œ with the 
communications department, which is th
e educational department. Let™s say Œ 

Q: Is that another day that you go in? 
A: Oh, of course. I-I don™t particular go in th
ere. Let™s say I went to  someplace in Œ 
in 
New Jersey 
to a school, who Œ a teacher who 
to ok Œ was with the mu seum on 
this Œ they have the bulf --
 Balfour
 scholarship that they bring teachers, 
Balfour
 
fellow, and the Œ oh, what™s this Œ I don™t wa
nt, I can™t think of it, of the name right 
now, but it was actually in 
New Jersey
 that I went, somebody, one of the teachers 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999

that was at this conference and sh e called 
[indecipherable]
 and wanted to have a 
survivor to come and talk 
to her class. And I went, as a matter of fact with 
John  
Minnick
 about two weeks ago, per Œ le-left on a Monday, we came back Tuesday. 
So you see, it™s two days. I don™t always 
particular do it in the museum. However, 
when they have the Œ these th
ings with the teachers, the 
Balfour
 and what™s the 
other one? It™s Œ I™m embarrassed  I can™t th
ink of the m Œ maybe it will come to me. 
It™s a fellowship, you know, th
at they get th-the teachers 
to come to Œ and they teach 
them how to teach the Holo caust in other sc
hools. And I speak to them lots of times 
as a survivor. They like it. As a matter of
 fact, if we had time I could show you 
some letters that I have gotten from some 
of these teachers, how they express how 
it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s so wonderful that what th
ey  have learned, and wh at the mu seum, 
how it™s wonderful, but however, just listening to a survivor makes it all to them so 
real that they put a Œ a very big empha
sis on having a survivor. This one tea-
teachers™ conf Œ conference did sp ecify that
, said that they sh
ould use this more 
often. 

Q: So you Œ is this the Œ one of the pr
imary things you do with co mmunications, 
going to  the schools and sp eaking Œ 
A: Y-Yes, we speaking as a Œ 
Q: Œ to the students. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
70
A: Œ yeah . Students and also to teachers, yes. All Œ 
Q: So you sp eak to 
groups of teachers Œ 
A: Yeah, mm-hm, yes Œ yeah  Œ 
Q: Œ on how to teach, or Œ 
A: Not so much 
how to teach Œ 
Q: Œ or ju st Œ 

A: Œ wh at was going on. 
Q: Œ the same kind of testimony Œ 
A: They sh Œ yes, th
ey should learn, because I Œ I am
 not equipped to tell them how 
to teach. 
Q: Okay. So, it™s similar to Œ 
A: Œ exactly. 

Q: Œ speaking to  the students. 

A: Exactly, exactly. Yes, yeah, but we Œ 
she doesn ™t tell me here that it™s the 
Balfour Œ Balfour
 the Œ what™s that, it™s such an
 easy name to remember. No, like 
this, we were just a Œ in 
New Jersey
 and one of the teachers wrote me a wer Œ you 
know, send me pictures, you know, I don™t 
like the pictures, but she send them to 
me.  
Q: So you do a l Œ an d have done a lot of speaking? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
71
A: A l Œ a lot of speaking. I do a lot of speaking and th at takes up a lot of my  time, 
too. 

Q: Mm-hm.  
A: I-I go to schools, I go from the museum
 and I also go from my own, where I Œ 
before the mu Œ museum wa
s even in existence, we used to have, from our 
organization, a speakers bureau wh ere s Œ 
Q: From the Greater
 Washington 
Su rvivors organization? 
A: Yes, mm-hm, yes, and they  would di 
Œ call us and we woul
d go, we would send 
out some people. We had some particular 
people that we knew th at they are pretty, 
you know, they are co Œ they don™t mind 
speaking. Because a lots of times some 
survivors don™t like to talk ab
out it. So we Œ we Œ we did 
that even before, so I have 
still a lot of schools that do that. They call me
 back year after year that Œ to come 
back to Œ to this school.  
Q: Do students always ask the same questions or do you get some different 
questions? 
A: No, different Œ different que
stions all the time, it™s a Œ 
Q: What kinds of things 
do the students ask you? 
A: Well, almo st Œ one thing one of the kids
 wanted to know whether Œ after the war, 
how my thoughts were after the war, whet
her I otherwise Œ whether a Œ I Œ I was 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
72
still thinking as if I was in the camp, or I 
started thinking like a free person. It™s a Œ 
it™s Œ it™s interesting to listen to them. 
Q: How old was that child? 
A: That child was already 
a little bit older, she was 17. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But I have had kids tell me Œ a 13 year
 old kid told  me once that while she was 
listening to me she was thinking how luck
y she was, that her children might not 
have a chance to listen to a survivor. And 
when I Œ when she fi
nished telling me, I 
said how old are you? And she Œ when  she 
told me she was 13, I almost flipped. I 

couldn™t believe it that a kid at 13 would 
have such insight in
 somebody™s Œ you 
know, to even think about it.
 And this she thought about 
it while I was talking, so Œ 
Q: Do you reme mb er any other e
xperiences with these students? 
A: With the students? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: All the time. Like when  you ask me 
about, you know, how I felt when I had the 
kids, but one school Œ I was Œ it Œ as a matte
r of fact it was the American university, 
it was a university. And when I came back 
Œ you see, in 1975 my  husband an d I 
went with  a 
UJA
 mission to  Œ back to 
Auschwit z
. And to, you know, kind of 
confront it. And wh en I came back, one Œ 
when  I was talking, one of the students 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
73
ask me Œ he said, Mrs. 
Spiegel
, you were Œ you were telli
ng us that you had such a 
Œ you went through such  a terrible period 
of your life, and no
w you™re telling me 
you™re married and you have three children Œ at
 that time I had only my three girls, I 
didn™t have yet grandchildren. He said, how
 come you brought in
 children into this 
world? And I stopped and thought about 
it and I said, you know what? I never 
thought about it. I-I-It was a natural Œ I got 
married, we wanted to have a family. I-
It was like a natural thing to 
do. But now that you ask me,I will tell you why. I said, 
what you actual expected me to do is 
really, I wouldhave
 given victory to 
Hitler
, 
because that™s what he started out to do
, and then, after I wo
uld have died, we 
wouldn™t have left anybody. So what Œ 
you wa Œ I would be helping him out. I 

mean, not that I thought abou
t it when I was having child
ren, but now that you ask 
me, I™m thinking about it. And he said, 
you know wh at? I can see your point. I 
never thought about it. It always bothe
red me. Because he apparently was from 
New York
 and he knew  a lot of survivors, 
and he was always wo ndering wh y are 
those people having children. He said, it 
always bothered me, why would you bring 

in children into this worl
d. But now he said, thank you for explaining it to me, 
because you™re right, I never thought of it.  
Q: What age group is your favorite to speak to? 
A: To speak to? 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
74
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Actually, you know what? Sometimes 
it™s junior high, because they  asks 
questions without stop. Bu t I have one gr
oup who is really Œ fifth graders and Œ 
because I usually don™t like to
 speak to such young kids. 
Of course, I use it a little 
bit different. I always say, I make lif
e beautiful, you know
, like this movie, 
ﬁLife is 
Beautiful?ﬂ 
I make it a little bit it sh
ouldn™t be so hard on th
e young kids. But this 
teacher also was taking a course how to 
s Œ teach the Holocaust
. And I spoke to the 
teachers and she called me to come to sp
eak to her kids. And 
I said how Œ what 
grade are they in? She says fifth graders. 
I said fifth graders, I™m sorry. I would 

rather not speak to them because I think 
th ey™re too young. Call me  when  they get 
into high s Œ you know, junior high sc
hool. She said, I will tell you what, Mrs. 
Spiegel
, I™ll make a deal with you. You come 
to me one time and if you won™t agree 
with that these kids are ready, then ne
xt time when  I call you, you may hang up on 
me. I Œ I w ent to her this last March I went to her, that™s already the fifth time. 
Because she really does. She has learned 
a lot about the Holoca
ust Œ the teacher, 
and she really prepares those kids so beau
tifully that they ask questions, I want to 
tell you that for an hour, she leaves a spec
ial hour just for questions and an swers. 
These kids Œ I can™t leave ti Œ they follow me
. I spoke just at this school, a Catholic 
school, they 
[indecipherable]
 and th ey gave me a 
[indecipherable]
, excuse me.

is looking fo r something. 
[tape 
break] 
Œ is back talking about Œ Mrs. 
Spiegel 
is back talking about what she was 
looking for. 
A: In Œ except I couldn™t find it. Must be 
in the washing machine 
Œ in the Œ in the Œ 
in the dishwasher. A Œ I went to th
is Catholic school. I understand that
 Caroline 
Kennedy 
went to that school. It Œ it™s a Œ a beautiful school. These kids, there mu st 
have been like about 300 kids. I want to 
tell you th at they asked questions that was 
unbelievable. When I was leaving, they 
were following me. I said to them, you 
know, I feel like the Pied Piper, you kn
ow, with the kids following me around, 
except I was really in a hurry because 
I had to get to the museum, it was on a 

Wednesday, so I wanted to get to th e mu seum for work, so I didn™t
 want to spend so 
much time. I said, you will have to make it 
an other time. But they  do ask very good 
questions, I™m always very 
pleased. No w I realize I™m not stupid enough to think 
that I can change everybody™s mind, but I re
alize that it does Œ it does Œ if I change 
even one kid a little bit to th
ink a little bit differently abou
t bigotry and hatred, then 
I always feel like may b e my work is paying
 off. In this one Œ another school was the 
Good Co unsel, the high school. That was 
also Œ Our Lady of 
Good Counsel, that™s 
the one on 
Georgia
 Av enue. Very  Œ also wonderful class. Some are Œ as a ma tter of

Georgetown Prep
, for the last like 
Œ I think last time when I went there I th
ink he introduced me as coming there eight 
year, you know, so 
I do speak a lot. 
Q: Now you have a certificate here, Woma
n of Achiev ement and you s Œ to ld me 
that you™d received other awards. 
A: Yes Œ 
Q: Do you want Œ can 
you talk about them? 
A: Well, I received an award of Œ from th
e United Jewish Appeal, because when we 
went with this group to the Œ to the Œ to 
Auschwitz
 and they really kind of 
appreciated what we did for them that 
Œ because it™s very hard, wh en you go to  
these camp s to visit, it™s very hard, it™s 
very helpfu l when they have a survivor 
there. See somebody, that somebody came
 out alive, because when you go there 
you think ev erybody is dead. So  that™s Œ 
Q: Now, who was on th is trip? 
A: There were Œ there were people from all o v er the 
United States
. 
Q: So it Œ y Œ were you the only Œ you and 
Sam 
the only survivors?

A: Œ yeah , yeah. So  we got from them an achievement award and of course from the 
Jewish Theological Seminary, because I™v
e worked for them the last 30 years, 
through the synagogue raised Œ also raised
 money. And Œ I also Œ my  husband and I 
go on the March of the Living. You know, 
this is a Œ we take a Œ a group of 
children, especia
lly through the

It™s the Œ the

 Youth

 get the Œ the young peop
le, between ag es 16 and 18 
and they  take him to 
Poland 
and th en 
Israel
. And we™v e been going on it since 19 Œ 
since 1994. We™ve gone ™94 - ™96 - ™97 - 
™98 and they  called us already fo r year 
2000. And I told them, can™t 
promise for sure. If our health
 is gonna be okay, we™re 
gonna go up with th
em. They take like about Œ altogether there are about six to 
7,000 kids. Six to 7,000 kids, 
but Œ six to 7,000 ki
ds but we Œ or not
 Œ on Œ with us 
Œ with the

Q: So 
Regina Œ
 let Œ let 
Regina
 describe them. 
A: Yeah. Oh. This Œ this was one of the pi
ctures from the March of the Living. This 
was one Œ 
Q: Can you describe the picture? 
A: The picture is Œ this is a group from my  bu
s, which they are, some of them Œ this 
is me and there™s Œ someplace is sa Œ
 Sam 
is here, and these are the leaders from the 
group. They are le Œ what they call 
Madrachim
 from the Œ from the group, from 
the 
B™nai B™rith
. This was the year, I think this was actu ally ™94. The Œ the four 
them Œ thi Œ was April fourth Œ 7
th
, ™94 that we went on this Œ this was our first trip 
and we had Œ they were a marvelous experi
ence and the things we get back from the 
kids Œ as a matter of fact, just recently I went, during the 
Yom Ha Sho ah
, one of the 
kids from one of these trips attends
 Georgetown
 Univ ersity here. And sh e had 
prepared a program 
for commemoration of 
the Holocaust for
 Georgetown
 
University and she asked me to come be the speaker there, and the kids were just 
absolutely wonderful. 
I mean, they are not such kids, they  are already college kids, 
they™re probably  19 - 20 years old, but th
e Œ I guess they felt so
 like I was that age 
almost when I came out. And this is one
 that I was just also spoke at the 
Aberdeen
 
Proving Grounds, you know, w
ith the soldiers. And I think 
I told you I 
happen ed to 
be there April 20
th
, and the soldiers gave me an ov
ation because it was the day when 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
79
I actually was almost like liber
ated, that was it. And this 
was in Œ in Œ oh, this is 
from Œ for the 
United States
 Army Material Command to Œ that I was a speaker on 
April, 1993. You know, all these things 
[indecipherable]
. Here is o n e that Œ oh, on 
the 
Woo dbridg e 
campus at the University of
 Virginia
, I was just recently a 
speaker. I go there, it™s probably already the 
fourth of fifth year that I go there. I 
happen to know this professo
r that works there and she ca
lls me every year. So I go. 
So as I say, I do a lot of this kind of wo
rk where in the eveni
ng lo ts of times, so 
that™s the on Œ that™s the reason I only do 
it once a week in the 
mu seum, because if I 
work ed lo ng Œ mo re time, I wouldn™t have a
ny time to do this and I feel like this is 
also very important to do this and Œ 
oh, and this is Œ this we got from 
Miles 
Lehrman
, an appreciation certificate for, you 
know, because for our work. And this 
is also that I was president of the 
[indecipherable]
 yeah, of the survivors Œ 
Holocaust survivors, when 
I stepped down  as president, because after being so 
many years, you can™t keep on 
being th e president counc Œ 
Q: How many years were you th e president? 
A: Probably  Œ was it like about three or f
our years? You know, at least three years. 
But you see, the reason I don™t remember
 ex actly, because even when I stepped 
down, I was doing just 
as much work, cause Œ 
Q: That can happen. 

 
Interview with Regina Spiegel  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
 
 
80
A: Yeah, so it didn™t make any difference, 
it just Œ except we sw
itched the ranks, so 
to speak because I Œ basically
 we have a nucleus of cert
ain people that do the work 
and we feel like we can™t be Œ somebody else
 doesn™t want to step in, so we feel 
like, between us, we™ll do it. So we take
 every time somebody else™s job so it 
shouldn™t be constantly in the same job. 
Q: Well, you™ve certainly told us a lot. 
What else would you like to say, or what 
have I not asked you? 
A: No, you have asked me qu
ite a bit. The only thing what
 I do want to say, that I 
do Œ I always like to finish with
 a Œ that I am really gratef
ul to this country, that no 
matter what they did before, they could 
have done mu ch mo re, but once it was over 
that I™m really grateful tothis country that they did le
t us come into this place, 
because I love the 
United States
. I really do. I feel like Œ I feel like Œ like I™ve never 
been born in 
Poland
, except Œ this is my country. 
I feel much mo
re towards the 
United States
 than towards the country that I wa
s born in. And I™m grateful. I have 
a very good life here and my  husband ma
de a very good living and we raised a 
wonderful family and wonderful kids and we™re
 really very gratef
ul t-to God and to 
this country for letting us in to Œ to do the work and we 
hope to be able to do the 

work as long as we Œ we can go on. That™s
 the main thing. And we appreciate you 
coming and listening to me, too.
