Question:  This is a United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Sara 
Sherman on May 16, 2014 in 
Washington, D.C.  Thank you, Mrs. Sh erman, for agreeing 
to speak with us today.  I really appreciate 
it. I'm going to start 
the interview from the 
very beginning, so we'll talk
 a little bit about your child
hood and the circumstances in 
which you spent your childhood. 
 And then we'll take it fro
m there.  So I'm going to  
begin with asking you when  you 
were born, the date you were
 born, where, and what was 
your name at birth.      
 
Answer:  Okay.      
 
Q: So when were you born?      
 
A: I was born on Au gust -- August 8 -- in 1938.      
 
Q: 1938.  Where?      
 
A: In Kamenets-Podolsk  in Ukraine, in Russia.      
 
Q: And what was your mo ther and father's names?      
 
A: My mother was Batia, and my father -- 
my birth father -- his name was Greesha 
Grechko.      
 
Q: Greesha?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Greesha Grechko.      
 
A: Yes.  Or Hersh in Yiddish. 
 
Q: Or Hersh.  Tell me, was Grechko also y
our maiden name?  The name you were born 
with?      
 
A: I assume -- yeah.
 
Q: Okay .  So  it would have 
been Sara Grechko.      
 
A: Sonya Grechko.      
 
Q: Sonya Grechko.      
 
A: In Russia, they called me Sonya --      
 
Q: Uh-huh.      
 

A: -- Grechko.      
 
Q: I see.      
 
A: And then  I heard that Grechko is a 
well-known personality.  In Russia, he was 
something in the politics or army
.  He was a cousin of my fa
ther or something -- my birth 
father.      
 
Q: Do you have brothers
 and siste rs?      
 
A: I would have, but unfortuna
tely, my younger brother -- th
ree years younger -- he died 
in the war.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: He had scarlet fever.      
 
Q: What was his name?      
 
A: Mishal.      
 
Q: Mishal.      
 
A: Or Mendel.      
 
Q: So you were born in 1938 in
 Kamenets-Podolsk --      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: -- which is in Ukraine.      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: And, in '38, there was no war yet, but 
it was almo st going to happen.  Do you have 
any memo ries of Kamenets-Podolsk?  Do yo
u rememb er what it looks like?      
 
A: I remember very little.  I know there were 
a lot of bridges.  Because, whenever we 
walked or drove, it was bridges there.  I re
me mb er when I opened the door, my  apartment 
-- or I don't know, it was a house -- I stood ther
e and the build ings looked  so huge, like 
never-ending, very tall buildings.  And I don'
t remember the others, or whatever, but it 
was in the middle of the city.      
 
Q: So Kamenets-Podolsk was a city.      
 
A: City -- a big city, yes.      
 
Q: And it wasn't a to wn or village; it was an 
actual city.  And your
 mother lived in the 
middle of it? That is, you lived  in the middle of the city?      
 
A: I don't know in th e middle, but she always to
ld me I was born in Kamenets-Podolsk.      
 

Q: Okay.      
 
A: That was the year -- I think it was not a farm
 or a little city, becau se she told me it was 
--      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: I should plan to go and 
visit her.  I have. It's a very nice city.      
 
Q: So you mention before that 
your birth father -- so does 
that mean you didn't know him 
very well?  What happened with your father?      
 
A: Well, the war started.  They
 took him to the army.      
 
Q: Who did?      
 
A: The Russian.  He was in the Russian army
.  He was a Russian citizen.  I think he was 
also born in Kamenets-Podolsk.  And th at's it. 
 And I don't remember his face.  S ee, they 
took him, and then my mother
 got a letter or message th at he was killed.  So I don't 
remember very good 
his face.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Do you have any early early 
memories from being a little girl?      
 
A: My mother was very protec
tive me.  She didn't  let me go by myself, be by my self -- or 
whatever.  I don't remember I we
nt to a nursery or kindergarten, because the war started.  
And my mother took me and my little brothe
r -- he was younger maybe -- a year and a 
half from me.  And then we went to her mo
ther.  She lived also
 in Kamenets-Podolsk 
there.  And we went there to be together, 
because she didn't want to be by herself, you 
know?      
 
Q: Did you reme mb er going th ere?  Do 
you have a memory 
of going to your 
grandmother's house?      
 
A: I know sh e rushed us to come
 and we went there.      
 
Q: Do you have a memo ry
 of your grandmother?
 
A: I don't remember h er.  The only thing I re
member th at we were -- we were there, and 
my mother's younger sister was th ere.  She wa
s not married yet.  And then th e older sister 
-- my  mo ther had two sisters -- and the older si
ster s, she was also two girls, and I and my 
brother.  And th e youngest sister, sh
e wasn't  married yet.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  But you reme mb er this -- you rememb er being there in that house?      
 
A: Yeah, I reme mb er and the names my  mo ther
 used to tell me about them, you know?  
My grandmother from my mother, 
her name was Soshe.      
 
Q: Sosh a.  And her last name?      
 

A: Her last name was -- [pause] -- Reide
r, Reider, R-E-I-D-E-R.  Reider.      
 
Q: Reider.  How long did 
you stay in your grandm
other's house?      
 
A: I don't know time, but it wasn
't seem very long because then we left.  I don 't know 
where my mother used 
to tell me always that, when she 
took us both  and run out, there 
was bombs.  They  started to thro w bombs, the Germans.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And she run fast.  And there were some bom
bs that didn't  exploded.  And there were 
some places that they were 
bombing, they exploded, and pe
ople were killed. It was a 
terrible thing.  My mo th er was wounded from a piece of -- I think steel or something that 
flew but -- and she went to grab  a piece 
of wh ite linen, put on th e hand.  And some 
people rushed her and said, "T
ake it off, because you are seen
 by the planes -- whatever.  
Take it off."      
 
Q: So they would see it.  They said 
the plan es would see her hand?      
 
A: Yes.  Somehow we run away
.  And I don't know who took 
us there, or whatev er, but 
we ended up at that time in Chelyabinsk.      
 
Q: Chelyabinsk --      
 
A: Chelyabinsk -- that's Siberia.      
 
Q: That's far away.  So, fro
m Kamenets-Podolsk, you end up 
in Chelyabinsk.      
 
A: Chelyabinsk.      
 
Q: Do you reme mber how you got
 there?  Was it by train, or was it by truck, or?      
 
A: It's -- it's like a dream.  Very cl
ouded.  Very clouded.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: But I know th at in Chelyabinsk, my  mo ther 
worked  in a factory of ammunition.      
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And she looked -- she used 
to  leave me and my  brother with her younger sister when 
she wasn't  working. Wh
en she was working, sh
e was work ing as a telephonist operator in 
a station -- a telephone station.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  So that meant that
 -- that was the younger siste r 
who wasn't mar ried.      
 
A: Wasn't  married.  H er name was Hannah.      
 
Q: Hannah.  And wh at was your grandmother?      
 

A: My grandmother was Soshe.      
 
Q: No, but where was she -- wa
s she with you?      
 
A: No.  I think she died, because she didn't  
run with us.  She died
.  She was killed or 
something.  And then all the 
aunt -- all the -- which was Feig
e, her name -- my  mother's 
sister Feige.  I always heard -- my mother used
 to tell me  -- that she had two girls, but one 
girl was killed when a bomb fell in or exploded
 nearby or something.  So sh e was left 
with one daughter.      
 
Q: That's y ou.      
 
A: No, no -- not me.  My 
mother's sister.      
 
Q: Oh, your mother's  sister
 -- excuse me.      
 
A: Yes.  She had two daughters, but one wa
s killed right away.  
You know, my mother 
used to tell me, but we were a kid and this
.  My -- I was born th
inking, "Where am I 
going to  play?"  You know?  But anyway, in 
Chelyabinsk, we were live there, how long I 
don't remember, but I know that
 was a lot of snow.  And I don't rememb er that I started 
school.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: It's too early.  And then from there -- I h
ear d somebody say "it's 
fire, it's war."  We 
wanted to  Uzbekistan.  And my  mo ther brought in
 a farm.  She was collectin g tomatoes.      
 
Q: Harvesting tomatoes.      
 
A: Yeah, yeah.  But I remember it was a fri
g h tening experience, because you know at 
that time w as already -- right before this 
my  brother got sick before we went to 
Uzbekistan.  He got sick -- I don't remember sh
e had a ch ance to take
 him to the hospital, 
no?  Maybe she took him to the hospital, but 
he stayed there for a very short time.  He 
died.  After he died, I got rheumatic fever.      
 
Q: You got rheumatic fever?      
 
A: Yeah.  They took me to th
e hospital.  When I was the la
st one, they put me in.  It 
secluded -- seclusion, because it was very contag
ious, and they didn't give us antibiotic.  
They  didn't have at that time.  So they put 
me on th e second, third floor where they were.  
They didn't let in my mother 
to go in.  And I was standing 
on the steps to
 talking down 
from the window and talking sign language 
with my mother.  One thing I remember 
something was my mother -- th
e nurses came  in and gave me
 a plate with a beautiful 
tangerines -- mandarinos or something -- which 
in Russia, it was very unusual -- the war, 
winter especially -- they said, "That's from y our  mother -- you eat it." 
 So this I remember 
was long time, over 40 days th
at I stayed there.      
 

Q: Fourteen?      
 
A: Forty -- four, zero.      
 
Q: So over a month.  Ov er a month 
you were in this hospital.      
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah.  She used
 to say to me that she'
s so sorr y she couldn't se
e me, you know?      
 
Q: That they don 't let her in.      
 
A: They don't let her in -- y
eah.  This was in Siberia in the Chelyabinsk.      
 
Q: What language did you speak with your mo ther?      
 
A: Yiddish.      
 
Q: You spoke Yiddish with her.      
 
A: Yeah.  And then, after my 
brother died, we decided to go 
to  Uzbekistan.  We went to 
Uzbekistan.  She was work ing for an Uzbek. 
 His whole head was bald, but the only thing 
that I reme mb er is a beautiful braid -- a l
ong, long braid.  And he had a very big 
mustache, but thehead
 was bald.      
 
Q: So a bald head  with a braid.
 
A: Yeah -- one braid -- a long braid from the ce
nter.  And he had a 
mu stache, you know?  
He had -- so she was work ing in the field,
 and I was running around. And [laughing] it 
was -- I did a mischief.  I came over. I grabbed a beautiful tomato, a
nd I bite the end.  
And that guy, Uzbek, came with
 a piece of wood, and he warn ed me, if I do it again, he 
will beat me up.  He scared me. This face -- 
his face I remember.  T h at I remember.  So 
we stay about -- and then we went back to Chelyabinsk.      
 
Q: Oh, really?      
 
A: Yeah, we were in Chelyabinsk.  And my
 -- at that time, it was war, but somehow, 
which was now my stepfather, 
they came from Polish Ukraine, 
from Sdolbuno, Rovno.      
 
Q: From Rovno.      
 
A: I don't know they  -- they get -- they passe
d the borders.  I don't know how they  did it.  
He and his brother.  His name was Moishe.      
 
Q: Your stepfather's name.      
 
A: Yeah -- yeah.  And I think it was two year
s after my  mo th er k n e
w that my father's  
dead, whatever.  So he 
met my mother.      
 
Q: In Chelyabinsk?      
 

A: In Chelyabinsk.  And my -- he came with
 a brother.  His name was Israel.  Israel.
 
Q: Israel.      
 
A: Yeah.  His name was Moishe.  And he me
t my mother.  My mo
ther's sister -- the 
youngest sister -- yeah.  A
nd th en my  mo ther got married
.  One day -- where I don't 
know, but I remember she got
 married two years after my
 father died.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And my aunts, that she was the youngest 
-- yes -- she married for his brother, Israel -- 
yes.      
 
Q: So Moishe married your mother, --      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: -- and Israel married your aunt.      
 
A: Hannah, yeah.      
 
Q: What was your stepfather
's last name?      
 
A: Lumdan [?].      
 
Q: Lumdan.      
 
A: Yeah.  He was from a little
 town in Polish -- in Ukrain
e, Poland -- Poland.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: And they were family of -- Lumdan in He
brew is 'learner'.  And they were from a 
family of learners and rabbis, and -- very
, you know, in the Jewish religion very 
important.      
 
Q: So they were relig
ious people.      
 
A: Yeah.  Lumdan is the name.  And he
 married her. I became, instead of Sonya 
Grechko, I became Sonya 
Lumdan.  And we continued to 
live in the same barrack -- we 
lived in barracks.  Every peopl
e, they shared barracks with
 -- you know what's  a barrack; 
it's a little hou -- a little build
ing built from wood.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: It's like when  you see in 
the pictures or something -- like, if you see little buildings 
that -- little -- like, you build for 
children in the back.      
 
Q: That's right.      
 
A: You know.      
 

Q: Like a little shed.      
 
A: Shed -- there was a shed.  Yeah.      
 
Q: And why was it that you lived
 in such places? 
In such a place?  Was there no other 
room anywhere?      
 
A: No -- there was no room.  We were lucky th
at we had room.  And my mother back to 
the board , and my  aunt Hannah, she also got ba
ck there.  I think we
 lived in the same 
barrack, you know?  Part of the barrack was 
ours. Part was half.  Every few families in 
the barrack was divided.  And we lived there.
  The most that I re
me mb er was t h e sn ow 
was so high.  A lot of snow.  
My mother used to 
walk me -- snow come up to here.  It's 
very very co ld and very
 snow there.      
 
Q: Was there enough to eat?
 
A: I know th at my  mo ther used to bring 
some, but it was not regular food.  You know, 
she -- they gave her for work
, you know?  So  she brought for me, because my  brother 
died earlier.  And he survived me.      
 
Q: How long did you stay there?      
 
A: I know in 1945 they say that the Polish c
itizens are allowed to leave Russia.      
 
Q: So it was until '45 that you we
re in Chelyabinsk?      
 
A: Yes.  So my stepfather was allowed to le
ave, and he took me 
an d my  mo th er, an d  we 
left.  And also his brother took my  mo ther's si
ster, and she left childre
n there.  Yeah.  But 
I forgot to tell this -- my moth
er had a younger brother.  And I think he was -- he was sent 
to the army  when  he was 17. 
 And th en  my  mo th
er, wh en I was Chelyabinsk, that he 
survived, but he's wounded.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And they told her -- my aunt
 -- that he's in one of the 
hospitals.  So they  went and 
walked from hospital to hospital,
 and they  found him.  He lo
st his right hand.  They  let 
him go.  It was still war, but they let him go.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And then he came.  He stayed with us 
for a while.  And then, 
when he was still in 
Chelyabinsk.  Then he -- he met a Polish wo
man.  She was a widow, but she had a boy.  
She had a boy -- she had a boy two years youn
ger than I was -- I wa
s two or three years 
older. And he got married with her.  So th
at's the family that I knew.      
 
Q: And so they -- you all left to go ba
ck to Poland; is that it?      
 

A: So yes, my father -- my 
stepfather was a Polish citizen, and the wife of my uncle, 
Mishal, was also Polish citizen.  And then that
's the way we could leave Russia.  So we 
left Russia.      
 
Q: By train?      
 
A: I think it was train.  And we we
nt to Bratslav in Poland.      
 
Q: And this is after the war.      
 
A: After the war.  And they let out th
e Russian -- the army let.      
 
Q: Do you reme mb er anything ab
out that trip, or about what Br
atslav looked like?      
 
A: It was buildings there.  And they were -- 
some of they were in
jured.  They were, I 
think, bomb s or something -- I don't know it 
was what.  Anyway , we
 settled there for 
awhile.  So my  uncle Mishal (indecipherabl
e).  And th en -- and he had a boy from his 
wife, you know?  Settled there.  And we stayed
 there for a while.  A
nd we had to decide 
what we're going to do. So we were really 
seeking to go to  Palestine, because nobody 
wanted to stay --      
 
Q: -- in Poland?      
 
A: -- in Poland, yeah.      
 
Q: So your stepfather went ba
ck to Rovno.  Did he ever go 
back there to see what it was 
like?      
 
A: No.  He didn't  go back.  He
 went to Bratslav.      
 
Q: Okay -- Bratslav.      
 
A: Yeah.  And they said that
 there are camps for people -- 
what they called the DP camps 
--      
 
Q: DP camps --      
 
A: -- in Germany.      
 
Q: And what are DP camps mean ?      
 
A: People that were -- what's it called? Dispensed from their houses, from their place, 
from their -- from the (indecipherable) born or whatever.  And they went there, because 
they heard that from ther
e, it's easier to go to
 Palestine.      
 
Q: So you were in su
ch a camp?      
 
A: So we left Poland, and we
 went to Germany.      
 

Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And we were ended up in Po
cking, which I was told is -- 
the biggest camp was there.  
The biggest camp.      
 
Q: Can you tell me the name again?
 
A: Pocking.      
 
Q: Pocking?      
 
A: Yeah.  Pocking.      
 
Q: Uh-huh.      
 
A: P-O-C-K-I-N-G.  It's a big camp -- was a bi
g camp.  So I and my stepfather and my 
mother, they lived 
there.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And we also -- also they -- my  aunt Hannah, she left later than
 we left.  We left first.  
The Pocking.      
 
Q: So you were at that 
point seven years old or ei
ght years old?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Did you ever go to  school
 when you were --      
 
A: Yeah, in Pocking I started to go.  They
 established -- it was a camp -- estab lished 
some Hebrew schools.  And my stepfather, 
he was a learned -- he knew Hebrew .  He 
knew -- he was teaching Hebrew, when he was even in
 Poland before he came
 to Russia.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Was a learned man.  And he tried to teach
 me Hebrew.  I know he want to teach me 
Hebrew, so I'll understand and learn Hebrew .  So yeah , they sent me.  I remember I 
learned something from there.  And th en -- y
eah, and my  uncle that was wounded in th e 
right hand, --
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: -- he also joined when he 
came to Poland.  So we decide
d to go to Germany, and we 
stayed in Po cking. Bu t my  aunt, Hannah -- she 
stayed.  She was left 
in Poland for a while.  
I don't know wh at was the reason.  I think her 
husband started the war there or something.  
So she said, "You go.  
I will join you later."  So we were  in Pocking.  And I know their 
desire was, because every Friday
 they used to get together a
nd were singing and dancing.  
So my mother and father heard 
that there is a group that ca
me from Palestine.  And they 

are trying to arrange a group of people that th
ey want to go to Palestine.  So we -- we 
joined th e group.  We signed up. No t ever
ybody was accepted.  But they were making a 
big, big group 
of people to form the ship to show 
the world against whom are the British 
fighting?  Because the British didn't let the Jewish
 people to come to 
Palestine.  And they 
were supporting the Arabs.  They tried to pr
event the Jewish people
 to come, but they 
didn't  want to let them take over the land.  So --      
 
Q: And where -- if you were in a DP camp in
 Germany, how do you get to a boat?  How 
did that happen?      
 
A: I don't know who took us -- the train or so
mething -- but I heard, they say that in 
Marseille is going to get together the people th
at they decided to go to
 Palestine.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And we applied.  And at that time my  mo ther was pregnant.  So we applied.  And they 

accepted us.  And then my uncle
, he was wounded.  He applied also.  He was accepted.  

So we decided we went to Ma
rseille.  How we went, I really don't remember.  But I know 
I think that -- my mother told 
me that we were lucky that we were accepted.  So he went 
to Marseille.      
 
Q: Do you have any memo
ries of what Marseille looked like?      
 
A: I think we came at night that
 time and they told us that 
we had to  -- at night in the 
evening we had to one day go to
 the boat and -- what I rememb
er is the bo at was staying 
not far from the beach in Marseille. And they ma
de like -- like, like a rub.  How to say?  
We put holes.  It was a wooden --      
 
Q: A plank?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: A plank with a rope?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And they say that everybody has to walk on 
this in order to get to
 the ship.  It was a 
big ship  there I saw, but we have to  walk.  
And my  cousin -- my  unc
le that she married -- 
and the woman, she had a boy.  So  he walk ed
 -- I mean, my mother 
walked.  My father 
walked. My uncle walked.  And 
we walked the first, I think.
  And the boy, his name is 
also Moishe.  He walked before me. And he
 showed  that he was courag eous, because I 
was afraid to walk on there. 
 And he walked .  And I was look
 -- he told me not to look 
down to the ocean, not to
 look to the sides.  Just to lo
ok at the person 
-- follow my eyes 
the person that walking.  So I was looking at
 my cousin.  He was walk straight.  And so, 

he showed himself, you know, courageous.  So
 I -- walked after him. It looked like -- it 
passed like a whole month -- you know, be
cause it was very scary.      
 
Q: When you're little and there'
s water on both sides.      
 
A: Not to  look down, just
 to look sides.      
 
Q: And so, you got on 
the boat?      
 
A: Yes.  But I forgot to tell that my sister 
-- step-sister -- was born 
in Bratslav.  And she 
was little that time I think -- two years or some
thing.  So he was walking, and he had a 
bag, you know?  Bag with 
stripes. And this was tied 
potty for a child, you know? 
[laughing]  It's my cousin -- 
his name is Moishe.  He used
 to call "Moishe with the little 
potty."  That's the name th
at was till he was the adult.
 
Q: Really?  Oh, he must have hated that name.      
 
A: The funny th ing is I was watching him walki
ng with this.  I used to laugh to myself.  
That is my memory of this.  
And I walked.  I finally got to 
the ship.  The sh
ip was so big 
and crowded -- very crowded.  And they put 
like shelves -- shelves, this, no mo re place. 
Everybody said, "Go in  the shelf and lay 
down."  You know there was room.  Many 
people, they have to squeeze in
. But my mother had belly so 
big, she couldn't go in.  She 
didn't  have room to slide in.      
 
Q: That's right.      
 
A: So th ey let us sit on the floor near where you 
have to step off to the shelves.  So I went 
-- entered the ship and we went there.  W
hoever was lucky could have slide in -- could 
have laid down -- but we were sitting there.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: And they  started to give out chocolate mi
nt for the children, big pots.  And every time 
that they went near us thus far -- I mean, 
not every time, but it happened many times that 
they slide or something and all chocolate fell --      
 
Q: Spills.      
 
A: Funny things that I remember.  I think I 
don't want to reme mb er the bad th ings what 
happens.
 
Q: Yeah.  What was the na
me of the ship?      
 
A: The ship was Exodus.      
 
Q: So it was the Exodus ship?      
 
A: Yes.      
 

Q: Wow.      
 
A: I didn't know that it was 
such an important name, but a
nyway, we were on the ship I 
remember.  They accepted special
 families that there were 
pregnant women. A lot of 
pregnant wo men.  A lot of orphans, they su
rvived the war, and they
 were -- their parents 
and everybody was killed.  So there was 
a woman, she gave birth on th e ship, but 
something got wrong.  I don't 
know exactly what happened, but
 what I remember is a big 
piece of wood, and they put it near the edges of 
the ship.  And she was laying on this.      
 
Q: She died?      
 
A: She died.  And th ey slide her down.  An
d I said, "Oh my God -- 
my  mo th er is also  
pregnant."  Since then, I had a horrible feeli
ng that my  mother is going to  die also, and 
they will slide her down.  Than
k God when the ship arrived -- 
but then they didn't let us 
in.  The British -- the British.      
 
Q: They didn't?      
 
A: The British surrounded the sh
ip the minute she left th e port of Marseille, and they 
followed her.  And that was the biggest ship 
th at was supposed  to (indecipherable), you 
know?  But they attack
ed the ship and corner
 of the ship was brok
en down, but they got 
the ship inside.  It was a bi
g strong ship.  And it was almo
st four and a half thousand 
people -- something like this. 
 But anyway.  The ship did 
not drown.  The ship  didn't 
drown.      
 
Q: It didn't sink.      
 
A: Didn't  sink.  And we came in.  There 
was few wounded.  There were young people 
that they were fighting in the 
building.  They were throwing fish or -- different cans of 
this.  And they were fighting the British.  
And the British were throwing tear gas and 
using tear gas, smoke, and smoke -- yes -- and different things.      
 
Q: On to the ship.      
 
A: Yeah.  On th e sh
ip -- yeah.      
 
Q: Did they realize that these were just people there -- regular civilians?      
 
A: Yeah, but they didn't want 
to let us in.  They didn't  wa
nt to enlarge the population of 
Jewish in Palestine.  A nd I remember they brought -- what they ca ll it when you lay down 
a sick person?  The stretcher?      
 
Q: That's right.  They brou
ght a stretcher?      
 
A: So my mother was on the stretcher.  And 
my father was walking near the stretcher.  
And I couldn't walk there, because there was a lo
t of water in the ship. Ship started to get 

water.  It w ent up here, here, here, here. 
 And [chuckling].  For me it was too deep, 
because I could have drowned.  So I rememb er
 two people with uniforms.  I think it was 
the British people -- soldiers -- one of them to
ok me on his arm, holding me. We were in 

Germany.  They  gave us portions, and they  ga
ve also cigarettes.  And my mother told me 
she had -- cigarettes is a good th
ing to bring to  Palestine, because she can sell it and make 

some money.  I have very good coat.  Nice coat.  And I had a lot of pockets.  And my  

pockets were full of cigarettes she put.  So sh
e said because the suitcases -- whatever we 
have -- they say to throw over 
the ship, and they will be pi
cked up from ot
her ships and 
will be taken to Cypress.  But she said, "The
y won't throw me in th e ocean -- on the port 
on th e ground."      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: When one of the soldiers picked me up 
somehow a pack of cigarettes start to fall 
down  and then another one.  And th ey were j
oking saying, "Look at this girl."      
 
Q: All the cigarettes.      
 
A: She may sell cigarettes or something.  
It was a funny moment, although I saw my 
mother's legs, she was in labor.
 
Q: Oh.      
 
A: She was in very bad pain crying.  It was 
the time.  A nd also the smoke that was on the 
ship and the noise, this caused her maybe ear
lier -- the beginning of the ninth month or 
something.  So it was scary, and it was fu
nny, because I didn't 
know that my mother 
putted pockets in the 
lining --      
 
Q: Yes.      
 
A: -- to be able to --      
 
Q: -- have some cigarettes.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: But tell me, how did the British soldiers e
nd up on the ship?  
Did they -- did they 
attack and board  it?      
 
A: They boarded to the ship 
-- yeah.  They boarded the sh ip
.  They board ed to  preven t 
every single --      
 
Q: Person.      
 
A: -- yeah to get to the grou
nd of Haifa.  Because they we
re on the way, and they will 
settle there.  They didn't want 
to let them in in Palestine. 
 They made up their minds.  But 
there were cases they had to, because some 
youngsters were wounde
d so bad that they 

gave imme diate help.  And my  mo ther was this.  She was in labor.  And she was sinking 
in the water.  I assume that 
the lower floors were full of wa
ter.  Because I know they took 
me -- I didn't want it, but they lift me up in th
e arm and they took me to take me out.  So 
yes.  So they brought us to
 the Rambam Hospital.  Rambam
 Hospital -- I believe I know 
it's a nice b ig hospital.  But.      
 
Q: And it was where?  Where is the --      
 
A: In Haifa.      
 
Q: In Haifa.  Okay.      
 
A: They let us in at Haifa, because they coul
dn't take us right away back to --      
 
Q: -- Marseille.      
 
A: Yeah.  And they left us, and left a few -- tens
 of youngsters.  They were wounded.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: I know so me were dead later on I heard. 
 But -- and they brough
t us to the hospital -- 
Rambam Hospital.      
 
Q: And did your mo ther give birth there?      
 
A: She gave birth.  It was a boy.  And he su
rv ived  maybe one day or two and he died.  He 
was poisoned with the smoke and all the gases th
at they said they -- 
they put gas I heard 
it.  In Germany, the concentration camp, they
 took people to the ga
s chambers.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: I thought that my mother -- 
she was horrible. I was afraid 
that they would throw her in 
the ocean like the other woman.
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: She was in labor.  But, you
 know, good thing that she su
rvived.  But there were other 
women th at they gave birth on the ship an
d was fine.  So we were in the Rambam 
Hosp ital a while.  And she gave birth, but the 
baby died.  At the tim
e that my mother was 
in the ship. And we were in th
e ship.  And they  let us out, but
 they put us in the camp in 
Atlit.  It was a camp.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And, when I was visiting Atlit, I saw it 
was like a prisoner's cam
p with high tile that 
you cannot go out.  So we are pr
isoners.  They put our fingers, 
and they took pictures left, 
right, profiles and everything. And they sent us
 in Atlit.  In Atlit, we were -- I don't know 
-- a few mo nths, whatever.  But, being in Atlit, 
we were listening to the radio.  And they 

announce that they 
decided to establish a Jewish stat
e.  But when I was in Atlit -- we 
were in Atlit -- I saw many peopl
e started to dance and clap and everything.  And it was a 
happy occasion.  And, you know
, the people were unbelievable. That was the same year 
that we arrived.  I don't know -- we arrive
d, I think, in the su
mmer.  You know, it was 
summer.      
 
Q: 194 -- ?      
 
A: Seven.  It was called the Exodus.  And in
 Hebrew, it was the Sea of Teropa[?],  leaving 
Europe like sea of Mizraim where the people le
ft Egypt.  Therefore they called it Exodus.  
So an yway, they were dancing 
there in the camp.  It was 
such a happy occasion when  
they went.  And we stayed there 
-- and, I don't know -- it was the end of -- the end of --      
 
Q: Okay.  Sorry for the interrup
tion.  So you were dancing in  
the streets because -- ?      
 
A: Yeah, I walked out, see everybody's danci
ng in  the street.  It was -- you know, for me 
the politics in that age didn't  impr
ess me, but impress me they were 
dancing in the streets.      
 
Q: Of course.      
 
A: Yeah, in the camp when I was.  Because my
 stepfather, he was a teacher in Poland for 
Hebrew.  So  he taught me, and I was in school there in the camp  and learned Hebrew and 
everything.  He prepared me.  And I was quite a good student.      
 
Q: Was -- were you close to him?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: So he was a good father.      
 
A: Yes.  And you know wh at?  Especially my
 mother, my father, we
 went to the hospital; 
I thought I'm going to have a brother or sister
.  And I remember a fe
w months before this 
I started to call him tatsy.  It mean s 'father'. 
 It's funny like, "I say -- Okay, I'm g o ing to 
have a brother, sister, he's going to  be my  fath
er." Start to call him tatsy.  My kids don't 
tell the story that he is my stepfather.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: But I loved him very mu ch, because he wa
s very dedicated.  He was a very good 
person.  He had a wo nde
rful character.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: I --      
 
Q: What kind of a person -- was he a very -- wa
s he somebody easy to be close to?      
 
A: Yes.      
 

Q: Uh-huh.      
 
A: And he had stories from the Old World.  An
d he used to love to teach and to show.  
He was working as a teacher.  Wherever he had 
a chance, he was working as a teacher.      
 
Q: So, in this camp, what did 
your parents do while he was 
teaching you?  Did they have 
to work, or did they just 
wait until they'd  be allowed 
in the country?      
 
A: They gave us some food -- 
whatever.  And my  uncle that was wounded, they  started to 
deal, to buy -- I don't k n ow, some stuff.  They
 went to the -- when we were in Pocking.
 
Q: Uh-huh.      
 
A: Oh, you're talking when  
we were in the --      
 
Q: In Israel already -- in Haifa.      
 
A: Oh, in Israel -- I forgot, when
 we were in Pocking --      
 
Q: Yeah?      
 
A: -- my father used to buy and sell to the 
farmers there, concentrated food,whatever 
they gave us. The udra they gave us.      
 
Q: They gave you food.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: They gave you rations.      
 
A: Rations -- whatever we didn't  use, we so
ld it. My uncle, they go to the farms and 
exchanging it for other stuff 
that's, you know?      
 
Q: That you might need .      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So my stepfather and my 
uncle, he was very young when
 he was wounded in the war, 
you know?  So they  were like going out to
 the farms and exchanging food and buying 
and selling and whatever.  And I 
-- even then I started to go to
 Hebrew school.  It was a 
school.      
 
Q: Yeah?      
 
A: And he was going to  -- to come in also some
 time as a teacher -- this and that.  But 
okay.  So I told you that they
 got to the ship.  Th
ey came, but they to
ok us -- even though 

my  mo ther was in labor and everything, and 
then they took us in 
the hospital, and sh e 
gave birth and th e baby died.      
 
Q: Yes.      
 
A: Baby died.  Some time they se
nt us in the camp Atlit.      
 
Q: Yes.  In Atlit -- what did your parents do in Atlit?      
 
A: They were prisoners.  Th
ey didn't do much.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: My father was volunteer to
 -- to work with ch
ildren, to teach them Hebrew a little.  
When you come into a new country, he wanted them to know 
the language. He was 
teaching me.  He was teaching a year.  And th
ere was a synagogue.  He had a wonderful 
voice also.      
 
Q: Was he a cantor?      
 
A: He was a cantor -- yes.  Before the war, 
yeah, he was -- in his hometown, Sdolbuno, 
Rovno.      
 
Q: In Sdolbuno.      
 
A: Yeah.  It's a little to wn in
 Rovno -- near Rovno.      
 
Q: Aside from himself  and his brother, was 
there anybody else from your famil y  who 
survived?
 
A: No, just them -- the two brothers -- be
cause they run away 
from Poland.      
 
Q: I see.      
 
A: And they came in the Russian border.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: They go to the Russian border.  They  took 
him in.  And they put 
him in also working 
as a [pause] -- labor work -- like a pr
isoner; they let him work.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So then they gave 
him freedom, because I know that he
 say that he had to work.  And 
he -- he was freed. But that was al ready I think in 1945.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: Yeah.  So anyway, I'm going
 back and forth.

Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So anyway, we went to visit them a lot,
 because it was my mother's sister.  And we 
never went to visit -- he was seeing his brothe
r.  So here and there.  And then, he invited 
me one time to very group of friends.  Then  
we started to go out.  It was -- when I met 
him, I was 16.5, almo st 17.  I met him.  And 
we started to go out, and I went to high 
school that time.  And few times he took 
me to high school.  But anyway, wh en his 
brother moved out, we moved in.  So we 
lived  near my  uncle and aunt.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Which is, my uncle was my father's brother, 
and my  aunt was my  mo ther's sister.      
 

Q: Close.      
 
A: Yes.  And my  aunt had -- I had cous
ins who was a boy named David.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Yes, and he died -- I think last year of 
cancer.  And his sister Leah -- Leah, yes -- she 
is also a teacher.  She is a teacher
 for Hebrew.  But anyway.      
 
Q: So you met when y
ou were 16?      
 
A: Almost 17.      
 
Q: Almost 17?      
 
A: Yeah, I was invited to an  event with him, so we st
arted to go out.      
 
Q: When did you marry?      
 
A: We married -- we wanted to get married 
-- I graduated high school, and I was planning 
to go to the -- to college.  A
nd, when I graduated high school, it was -- what year was it?  
1947?  '56 or '57 -- something like this -- yeah
.  And I signed up for the University.  We 
went out already, it was almost two years.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So Ezra say to me, "Let's  
get married."  But at that time 
started the Sinai War.  Before 
this was problems.  We postpone, postpon
e, postpone till it was December 25th.  Funny 
thing that I didn't  know it was Decemb er 25th.  
For me, it didn't say a lot, because I lived 
in Israel.  A nd I was going to the university
. And, when  we got 
married in Haifa in 
Windsor -- in Windso
r Hotel.      
 
Q: Windsor Hotel.      
 
A: Yeah.  When  we came out of the cere
mony and ev erything -- the wedding was a very 
nice wedding -- the ships of port Haifa started to
 blow their horn.  And it was.  I said to 
my  husband, "I don't know -- [laughing] are they celebrating our wedding?"      
 
Q: Exactly.      
 
A: It's funny, you know?  Because I know those 
things started -- if I don't want to be -- if 
I don't want to be negative, I have to reme mb er the happy occasions and the funny things, 

right?  So I said, "What are they --      
 
Q: Celebrating your wedding -- yeah.      
 
A: So we married in December 25th.  Peopl
e ask me, "You didn 't know that it's 
Christmas?"      
 

Q: [laughing].      
 
A: I said, "Sorry, I didn't know."  I didn 't know.      
 
Q: So your wedding anniversar
y is every year --      
 
A: -- on Christmastime.      
 
Q: -- on Christmastime.      
 
A: Yeah.  I'm celebrating Christmastime.  Se
e? Although I'm Jewish, but I'm celebrating 
and it's very nice.  But the thing is I'm going 
back.  When my mother gave birth -- yes?  
When she was in the sh
ip, in the hospital, I was expec
ting -- I was expecting to have a 
brother or sister, but my dream fell apart.  So
 I remember that when
 we finally settled in 
Israel, I said to my mother, "I would like 
to have a brother or sister."      
 
Q: And what did she say?      
 
A: She said to me, "I'll see.  Maybe."  It didn't happen.      
 
Q: Did your mo ther tell you stories a
bout her childhood in  Ru ssia?  About what 
Kamenets-Podolsk was like?  About the early da
ys when  you were little?  Did that ever 
happen?      
 
A: Well, we were in Russia.  I tell you, it's
 -- it's like a blank I have.  I don't know why.  
Because I didn't have enough time to --      
 
Q: Well, you were very little.  You're very littl
e.  But did -- afterwar
ds when life settled 
down  somewhat, did she th
en tell things?      
 
A: In Israel.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: She would from time to time sa
y that, you know, it wasn't ea
sy life.  It was n o t easy 
the life.  A nd it was some 70's in there.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And, when she left Russia, she was still
 a young woman -- yes. 
 So she was open for 
her new life, for her new beginning,
 you know, the Ex
odus.      
 
Q: How long did she -- when  did your mo th er pass?      
 
A: When we lived in Israel --      
 
Q: Uh-huh.      
 

A: -- some people that from my
 husband's hometown came to 
visit us and to  say to us, 
"Come to visit America."  And one of them 
was my  husband's neighbor. And th ey -- so 
we went to -- and they  came to visit us. And th en we decided to go to  America -- left the 
three children with my parents.      
 
Q: Oh, with your parents.      
 
A: Yes, in Israel.  And I went -- I think it was '68.  1968.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And I went to America.  We went to vi
sit here. We stood here
 for two months.  And 
one family, they convin
ced us -- they were my
 husband's neighbors before the war.  And 
they start to convince us, "C ome stay -- come to America 
stay.  If you live here, you'll 
feel better -- this and that."  Although my
 husband told  to me, he was very active in 
fighting for Israel.  He was in Palma, this an
d that.  He said, "Okay.  I gave enough of 
my self.  Maybe I'll do it."  And he convin
ced me to go to America.  Which it was 
difficult for me, because I didn't w ant to leav
e my parents.  But then he said, "Don't 
worry -- we'll come and be established here." 
 So we agreed.  And that what happened.  
We came to America. First to Long Island.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: He had a friend.  We lived there.  And th
en I remember it was like a year later when 
we came, and I told my parents that I want th
em to come.  It was the Passover Seder, and 
they came.  And my father 
conducted the Seder.  And my 
house, it was so many people -- 
friends and neighbors -- and th
ey really had a wonderful tim
e.  My father chose in 
Philadelphia.  I remember I bought a huge tabl
e, many chairs and everything, to be able 
to celebrate the Passover.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So my parents came, and th
ey stayed with us. And then. 
 Somehow I don't  know what 
happened.  I think they were -- they had an apartment, an d 
they left everything.  They  
came to visit.  Then they said
 they want to go and give 
it up and do whatever.  And they  
went back  to Israel to give it up.  And I reme mb er that time my  daughter Hessy was in 
Israel.  She convinced 
them to come back to
 America.      
 
Q: Ah.      
 
A: You brought them th
ere back.  "You brought th
em back."      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: She brought them back after a few mont
hs.  Then they stay
ed here.      
 

Q: Did you and your husband ev er return to 
Europe to visit those places where you grew 
up and he grew up, or anything like that?      
 
A: He went back with a friend from Israel.  My
 children were little when
 he went, --      
 
Q: Uh-huh.      
 
A: -- so I couldn't leav e them.  So he went.  I'
m still planning to go. 
 We'll see.  That time 
the kids were little; now my 
husband says he's too old. 
 
Q: [laughing]  Never the right time.  That's right.      
 
A: There's no happy medium, you know, between
 this and th is.  My kids grew up, and 
then the grandchildren came.  An
d I always said to him, "I will go if you want to come."  
He says he will not remember it.  But you kno
w what?  He told me 
that this little town 
didn't  change mu ch.  Never did told me.  Now, 
I didn't see my town that I was born.  That 
I would like to see it -- yes.      
 
Q: When it quiets down ther
e a little bit.      
 
A: Yes.  Anyway, th at's  the 
funny thing th at we always plan -- not always it comes out.  
Anyway, my parents stay with us.      
 
Q: Uh-huh.      
 
A: And my mother died in 1998, which was 
-- she was 80 years old 
when she died.  She 
got Parkinson's, and she started 
to be in bad shape, so she 
died.  And my father lived till 
2005 --      
 
Q: Wow.      
 
A: -- seven years later than her.  Beside that he wa
s older than her at least 10, 12 years.      
 
Q: So he was almo st 100 years old?      
 
A: Yes -- he was 97.5.  But it's funny.  Hi
s voice was unbelievable.  He had a wonderful 
voice.  And wherever there was 
a chance, he used to sing. (i
ndecipherable).  But that was 
such a happy occasion. He used to sing, 
and everybody started to dance.      
 
Q: Oh.      
 
A: People long in Phil
adelphia.  Su rvivors group. It's called the New American Ho locaust 
Surv ivors -- yes. (indecipherable).  Some body was invited a few times there and 
whatever and was occasionally started to si
ng and everybody clapped.  He was a happy 
person.      
 
Q: When I was talking with
 your husband, --      
 

A: Yes.      
 
Q: -- it was clear that h e didn't speak about what 
he went through for many, ma ny years.      
 
A: He didn't want to tell 
me and all the children. He
 couldn't talk.      
 
Q: And so, he didn't tell you de
tails of what it's like?      
 
A: Lately he started to say "When I was in th
e forest."  It's not like -- like a history thing 
that you tell this and this year -- a progressi
ve.  He remembers some
body told you that 
they decided to talk now.      
 
Q: Well, not just now -- before -- a little bit 
earlier.  But it had took many years.  It was 
not something that --      
 
A: Yes.  They couldn't talk
.  They could not.      
 
Q: What about you?  Did you 
tell your kids what your life was like until you got --      
 
A: I told them I was in  the Exodus and that's  
it. I didn't talk much ab
out it.  But Exodus -- 
I mean, Exodus was well-known ship.      
 
Q: Yeah.  And there are, you know --      
 
A: And I -- I start to tell them I was in Exo
dus. And then th ey thro
w that woman that was 
pregnant.  She gave birth to a ba
by.  She died.  Yes.      
 
Q: And you saw them bury her at sea.      
 
A: Yeah, it was scary.      
 
Q: It was scary -- sad and scary.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Is there some --      
 
A: My mother tells me that 
the people, some people that 
were from the Exodus and there 
were some women that they -- af
ter they left the Exodus that 
they gave birth, and this.  
So, when they saw this
, they say to her, "So how are yo
u doing after you have such a 
trauma?"  She said, "I'm tryi
ng to survive."  Becau
se they had their children with them.  
They  gave birth after.  She wa
s -- my  mo ther started in nine month.  Never happened 
with her.  Anyway , that is the story of Ex
odus.  Yeah.  I don't know how mu ch  in new 
mu seum.  Did they  have really -- did they  have
 really places that th
ey took pictures from 
the boat or something?  I don't know.  I wanted to see that.      
 
Q: I don't know.  There might be.  But the pos
t-war part of the story -- the post-war part 
of events is something that is
 not the main focus.  The ma
in focus is, of course, what 

happens during the war and the Ho locaust during 
the war.  Is there anything you'd like to 
add today that I didn't 
ask you about?      
 
A: What I want to add is that now I unders
tand that the -- that th e ship that was very 
crowded and my parents, I mean, they're very
 uncomfortable sitting on the floor for the 
whole trip.  I mean, you couldn't  stretch -- wh
atever -- it was there.  But, after she came 
to Palestine, then we ca
me Israel.  She became a sy
mbol of fight
ing the British 
government.  Although above her declaration wa
s to give a sta te to 
the Jewish people, but 
it seems that the British ignored it.  It's funny,
 because (indecipherable) was the first that 
came out, now th e Jewish people have to have a state of their own.      
 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.      
 
A: And didn't -- didn't -- there's 
a lot to -- that the ship woul
d be drowned.  I know it was 
in water. When I came down the ship, they carried me out.  Y
eah. But that's the politics.  
Yeah.      
 
Q: What would you want -- what would y
ou want your grandkids 
and th eir kids and 
future generations to understand about your life,
 about the people of Israel who survived  -
- many who were survivors 
and who had co me from World War II -- what would you 
want them to understand ab
out their lives?      
 
A: Noth ing comes easy.  Life is a battle, you k
now?  It's a struggle.  When  you succeeded 
this -- you succeed like they pr
ove the whole world th at the Jewish people are very 
stubborn and won't give 
up.  Although, the British are very
 bad.  I know that we lived 
there -- my mother sa
id that that was attack from th
e Arabs.  Was fiery I think -- 
something.  And they -- ther
e was an action -- something.
  And that was the time the 
Jewish people --      
 
Q: Stop.      
 
A: Yes.  And also there were a lot of crimes, a lo
t of -- that the people suffered a lot also.      
 
Q: Fight for the freedom.      
 
A: Yeah, oh -- the fight for th
e freedom, everything, yes.  I rememb er that we came -- we 
came and we lived at Haifa among the -- in the h
ouses that the Arab s left; they run away .  
But at nighttime, although the 
Arabs -- they had leaders -- and 
at nighttime they started to 
dissel [?], and th ey got together and tried to
 do different things to harm the Jewish 
settlers.  It wasn't easy .
 
Q: So there wasn't secur
ity even there.      
 
A: No, there wasn 't security.  It was 
-- every day was a struggle --      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 

A: -- but you know.      
 
Q: But you had three children --      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: -- who had their own children.  So now you 
have a family that survived and thrived, it 
sounds like, you know?      
 
A: My poor mo ther -- she lost two boys.  One 
younger than me a little bit and one, he was 
a baby.  She paid a lot.  She used to call me
, " Y ou are my only eye in
 my head."  I said, 
"Why?  You have two eyes."  And she said, "No."      
 
Q: Oh.      
 
A: It's a shame.      
 
Q: Well, she did pay a price.      
 
A: Yeah.  She did pay a price.  But she -- she 
died in 1998.  So Ju
stin, you were already 
how old?  Six.      >>   
   Justin:  Grandmother made 
it to my bar mitzvah.      
 
A: And how was he?  How was it; do you reme
mber? H uh?  Perfect.  He was such a 
happy person.  He was the center of a party --
 always.  That's what I remember. And my 
mo ther also had beautiful voice -- soprano -- 
which I remember.  And then our Seder was 
very nice.  Our getting together
 and everything.  I have a g
ood memory from that.  That's 
what it is.  Thank God -- yes.      
 
Q: Broken?      
 
A: Yes.  And although I have 
no brothers and sisters, but we
 had a nice life.  And now we 
have a nice life -- the children 
and their children.      
 
Q: Well, thank you.      
 
A: I hope they will not have to struggle like me, you know?  They  will have their lives 
easy-going.      
 
Q: Well, without such --
 without such challenges 
and threats.      
 
A: Yeah -- oh yeah.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: My husband also I told you
 about, he had a lot. He star
ted as young boy and a long 
time to struggle.      
 
Q: So --      
 

A: I hope peace will be in the world.  That will be
 the most thing that we can accomplish.      
 
Q: Okay.  Thank you.      
 
A: Thank you very much.      
 
Q: Thank you very much.      
 
A: Yes.  You know, I didn't  want to talk, be
cause I didn't see that I have all the picture 
straight, you know?  It was for me a little b
it there, a little here, but it came.      
 
Q: It came.      
 
A: It came to me.      
 
Q: Thank you very much for what you shared. 
 I mean, and it came well.  We got a sense, 
and we got a picture of your lif
e and your Exodus an
d your odyssey to Is
rael and beyond.  
So thank you.      
 
A: You're welcome, and I ap
preciate you gave me those pi
ctures.  You developed the 
history.  You got a view of the hist
ory.  That's very nice.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: Thank you, ev erybody.      
 
Q: You're welcome.  You're 
welcome.  And this concludes 
the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Sara 
Sherman on May 16, 2
014.  Thank you very 
much.      
 
A: Thank you.
