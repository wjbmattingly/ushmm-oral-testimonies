W ehave prepareda brief slidepresentation to help with his introduction.
 
 
T his isa 1946 portrait of  MartinW eiss. Martin was born in 
Polana, Czechoslovakia, in1929. In1939, Germ any occupied onehalf  of Czechoslovakia and 
Hungary the other half.  After the Germ an invasionof  the Soviet Union in 1941, conditions in

Polana worsened.  By 1944 Martin'sfam ily was transported to theMunkacs ghetto. In May 
they were deported toAuschwitz
-
Bi rkenau killing center where Martin, hisfather, brother,and 
two uncles were selected forf orced labor.  Later Martin andhisf ather were sent to 

Mauthausen concentration cam p in Austri
a . 
 
 
Here we see adocument recently uncovered in the IT Sarchive.  
T hisdocum ent isa Prisoner Registration Card which ref lects Martin's transferf rom Auschwitz

[Applause]
 
 
I think we have so much to cover
 
today. W ewanted to start by 
asking you, Marty, to talk a littlebit about your lif eas a young boy in Czechoslovakia bef ore 
the war, about what life was like in your town and with your f am ily and your com munity.

>> MartinW eiss:  I grew up in a part of Czechoslovakia.  I'll explain a little bit. It'snot 
Czechoslovakia now.  You only have the Czech Republic.  Bef ore there was Czech, Slovakia, 
and 
R
use, they call
ed
 
it
.
  
Mostof  thepopulation was Russian speaking.  However, not like 
Russia, like deeper Russia, this was like European Russian
; l
ike m ost of  the people there were 
Russian. 
 
 
T he reasonI'm explaining, then the war cam e. W e were 
occupied by Hungary.  So it was Hungary f rom  1939 to1945. And then in 1945, actually it was 
part of Russia,underRussia.  Andnow it's Ukraine.  So if  I lived there allof  this time, I would 
have lived in all of  those countries
;  
however, i t would bethe sameplace. 
 
 
Life,as I rem em ber it when I was gro wing up, was ver y nice.  
Czechoslovakia was a democracy.  There 
wa s
 
--
 
a f ew democracies in Europe at the time.  
Poland 
w
as a dictatorship.  Hungary had adictatorship of  som e sense. W efelt very, ver y 
fortunate.  
 
 
I remember even when I was in grade school,we knew the 
value of  democracy.
  
One thing I rem em ber they would teach usaboutdem ocracy, in third 
grade we elected apresidentof  the class justto show us how it was done. Those little things 

don't sound very im portant, but to usat the tim e it was very, ver y
 
--
 
I remember as a kid, it 
m eant a lot.
 
 
My f ather was inbusiness.  W ealso did ourown f arm ing. W e 
hadafarm . I hadolder brothers.T hey didall the work, consequently.  As they got older, my 

father didn't pay them so they went to the city to lookf or jobs to getpaid.

In the m eantim e, I had one old
erbrother lef thom e.  I was 
gro wing up, so I was about
 
--
 
let's see, whenthe Hungarians cam e,I was about 10. W henI 
was 11, 12, m y older brother andI did most of thef arm ing. W e plowed with horses, the old 
wa y
, l
ike you see in the picture.  And we didall kinds of work.  Also, it was a business. W e did 
th a t, too .
 

>> GretchenSkidmore:  How big was your f am ily?
 
>> MartinW eiss: T here was nine of us
:  
f ourboys andf ive girls.  Might as well say it now
, w
e 
went to cam p, actually m y two younger sisters and m y mother died im mediately in Auschwitz
, 
a
s soon as we got there.  I had an older sister.  She died towards the end of  the war, the very 
endof  the war.  My f ather was with m e.  Hedied where I was in a working camp.  Andm y 

older brother,he was a ver y healthy, strong guy.  Believe it or not, supposedly he was 
liberated, but he disappeared. W enever heard of  him . Som ethinghappened to him . There 
are rumors what happened to him
, t
hatanotherf ellow, inm ate, killed him . But Idon't know for 
a f act.  
 

 
So basically that's what happened tom yf am ily.  T he rest of 
them  did survi ve.
  
I had one sister,by the way, that was ver y sm art.  She was workin g on 
papers to go to the United States. In1939, just abouttwo weeks before the occupation, she 
wa s lu cky 
enough shegot out.  She got thepapers. She got out. She went to the United 
S ta te s
 
all by herself .  You have to rem em be
r 
we had no money.  She didn't have any m oney.  I 
don't know how she did it. But somehow
 
--
 
and by the way, other people were waiting
 
f or a 
visa f or the United States forf ive, six years and couldn't get it.  Somehow she did it in a very 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
short tim e.
  
 
 
T he reasonI mention this, because lateron,af ter the war was 
over, she was instrumental of  getting us aff idavits f orm y sister andI and were ableto come to 
the UnitedStates rather quickl y af ter the war.  I just wanted to cover that.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  So you and yourf amily f elt like you hadfull rights in your town and in 

your com munity.  Younever hadany sense of any diff erence
s?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  No. Wefelt we were citizen s.  Period.  Nobody pushedus around or 

anything.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  And how did life change, then, whenthe occupation, Hungarian, 

occupied your part of  Czechoslovakia?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Lif e changed 
almost im mediately.  Even 10 years old, we knew right away 
things were not good.  One of  the reasons it changed, the wholef orm  of government
 
--
 
first of 
all, they used to havea mayor was voted by thepeople. All of a sudden now the mayor was 

appointed by som ebody.  Usually you had tobe sortof a Nazi
 
sym pathizer.  And then, of  
course, came out the laws, conf iscated all Jewish
-
o wned businesses.  If peoplehad a job,like 
let's say they were a teacher or whatever, they lost it.  My sister was going to sch
oo l,  lik e  
college.  She was sent hom e. She couldn't continue. And soon.  So we were affected 
im mediately.
 
 
My f ather was old enough, served inW orldW ar Iunder the 
Hungarian 
E
m pireat the tim e. He says, well, the Hungariansare anti
-
Sem iticbut they're not 
so bad, you could getalong with them . W ell, it turned out,as tim ewent on, they came out and 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
7
 
they were ver y, ver y nasty. W hat they were doing is copying what the Germans were doing in 
Germ any.  They were doing it in Hungary.
  
In
 
Germany they passed a law.  They also passed 
the same law.  
 

 
And this continued
 
--
 
around 1940, 1941, they had a 
m obilization. All the Jewish m enm ilitary age, which was f rom  about20 to 45, were inducted 

into the Arm y.  Not theArm y, because we wer e politically undesirable.  Ok?  So they putthem  
in t o
 
--
 
they wore ci vil ian clothes. They calledit working battalion. W hat they used themf or, 
they wanted them  off the street so they couldn't organize to be an underground or som ething 

like that.  So they tookall of  those men,had them under Arm y jurisdiction. T hey usedthem for 
cutting down thef orest.  They went to work and usedthem . Like
, 
my t wo brothersended up in 
the Ukraine, on the Russian f ront.  
 
 
Andover there thingswere terrible
 n
ot only for
 
them  but even f or 
the Germans,evenf orthe Hungarians. The conditions were not good.  But they were under 

ve r y,  very
 
--
 
how do 
I pu t it
 
--
 
had no rights of any kind.  My brothers, they used themf or 
picking m inef ields or burying the dead, doing those ki
nds of  chores. 
 
I of ten wondered
: 
 
wh y  
didn't they escape? They hada chance toescapebecausethey were not locked up. Like in a 
concentration cam p you couldn't
, b
ut over there.  
 
 
And the reason was very sim ple.  They cam ef rom a culture, our 
upbringin
g 
--
 
excuse me
 
--
 t
hat you can't be responsiblefor som ebody else's death. So what 
the Hungarians were doing, they copied againf rom  the Germ ans
.  I
f  somebody escaped, they 
would take the company ofm en, line them up on af ield,and just count up to 10 an
d sh oot

ever y 10th person. 
 S
o becauseof  that, they didn'tescape becausethey were af raid of being 
responsiblef or someone else's death.  Excuse me. 
 
 
As time went on, the conditions got worse and worse.  It was 
ver y, very se vere.  Oddly enough, like
 
I 
s
aid,thepopulation were Russian. They didn't like the 
Hungarians any
 
m ore than we did.  Politically we were on the sam eside. W e were against 
them .  However, people are very f unny at certain times. A certain am ount of  people
 
--
 
I'm n o t 
going to say ever ybody.  T here were good people.  You gotalongwith them, lived alongside of 
them  just like in the United States
:  t
heIrish,Spanish, whatever, don't care.  And we were 
basically the sam e.  However, there was always a few thatfor the slightest little ad
vantage 

they would go and squeal on you or give you up to the police, something like that.  
 
 
T here were people you try to gi ve them  help. Believe it or not, 
we had to be so careful thatm y m otherused to take m y two younger sisters to carry a bag of  
sand
wiches, like on the other side of town but that nobody should get suspicious. You would 
never know who would gi ve us up.  And thepunishm ent was ver y severe.  So we had to be 
ver y, very caref ul. This was just one of the things of how lif e went on.
 
 
I ' ll 
jum paheadto1944.  Inthe meantime, we kepthearing all the 
atrocities taking place in Polandand Ukraine. Andby the way, we li ved
, 
i t  ju s t  s o h ap p en ed,  
only about 25, 30
-
kilom eters away f rom thePolish border. So theRussians, at thattim e they 
had split Poland in half.  Russiahad one half of  Poland and Germ any had the other half . So 
the Russians were close tous. Som any m en would escape to theRussian side to goand 
join. W hat happened is, as this was going on
,  
they were ver y strict in watching what people 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

were doing because they f igured som ebody was
 
--
 
how can I put it
 
--
 
aiding andabetting these 
people. All somebody had todo was whisper that youdid something and you were arrested 
and given the thirddegree. T his isthe way l ife was.
 
 
Jum pi
ng aheadnow, this went on all the way up through1944.  
1944, like I say, we kept hearing atrocitiesbut
,  
more signif icantly, kept hearing atrocitiesthat 
were alm ost unbelievable.  Eventhough I was ver y young, I rem ember m yf ather talking about 

it, to  o
ther people.  And m yself , eventhoughI was young, you understood. How could the 
Germ ans do that?  You have to rem em ber,Germ any was in science, medicine
, m
usic.  They 
were ahead of the rest of the world.  How could they do this? 
  
So we heard these stori
es
, v
e r y 
descriptive stories.  But we could not quiteunderstand thatGermans coulddothis. Ok?  You 

believed it, but we could not believe it.  I know it sounds contradictory.
 
 
T hen we heard specif ic stories likef rom  theW arsaw Ghetto, that 
they were taking people and putting them  into theArm y truck with acanvas over it and then 
they would drive around with the truck, put the exhaust into the back of  the truck, anddrive 
around until the people were gassed todeath. W eheard those stories. Then we heard of 
m assacres, big massacres.  T hey had a group called Einzatsgruppen
.  T
he ir jo b
 
went into 
Russian, Ukraine, Eastern Europe. T hey were going
 
--
 
they had what
 
--
 
that's what they called 
a 
B
lit zk r
i
eg.  T he Russians couldn't standup to them . T hey would
 
sli ce right through it. T hey 
had this Einzatsgruppen
 
--
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  The English words for thatarem obile killing unit. So there were four 
different units thatfollowed the arm edf orces.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
>> MartinW eiss: T hem obile killing units were l
iteral
ly f ollowing like a sweeper, would come to 
sweep up. They would go intoevery sin gle town and village.  It didn't matter, som e villages 
believe it or not,had like f ive Jewish f am ilies
, s
om e had 105
o
r som e had 20,000. They would 
just go and literally, like a sweeper, just sweep up all the people, take them toaf ield and just 

k ill t h e m
; l
ike that.T his went on for years.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  W as there an involvem ent of your neighbor in one of those?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Yeah.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  Can y
o
utalk about that? 
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Yeah.  Ihad oneneighbor, he was not anicem an even as it was.  Butwe 
did som ebusiness with him because we neededhim , again,because we were doing business 
selling stuff  to the Army.  And we were not allowed to 
because
 
--
 
itwas politically undesirable.  
So we used him asa partner. W edidall thework, but we shared the profits.
  
Anyway, he 
joinedtheArm y, the Hungarian Arm y.  And he was up inthe Ukraine.  
 
 
As Im entioned,the Germans were doing thisas the 
Hungarian 
troops. And like I say, a lotof  people that were there 
in
 
the working battalions
.  
I hada cousin, 
a second cousinactually, he was there andhe recognized him.  Hewas there.  He was a 

sergeant.  He was one of  those com m itting atrocities. T hey were thr owing women and 
children into the river.  There was a river.  And this river hadbodiesf loating every single day, 
hundredsand hundreds of people every day.  They threw them in. Sometimes the guards ona 
bridge would have nothing to do, sof or 
fun they would go
 
--
 
andby the way, they took a lotof  
Jews at that timef rom  different areas and they brought them out,f ixed them up, but they didn't 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
have the cam ps yet. Auschwitz didn't exist ye t. T hat was the earlierpart. So they let them  
loose 
in
 
the Ukraine. And it was a very 
inhospitable
 
place.  It was ver y cold.  Most of the 
people were ver y poor.  They didn't have any decent shoesor clothing.  They didn't have 

any
 
--
 
they hadm ostly sheets.  They threw som ething in apillowcase or sheets. T hey had 
buttonson their shoulders. T hat's all they had with them . The climate inW orldW ar II was 

extrem ely cold.  And that part of the world, 30below zero was notuncommon.  It was just very, 
ver y cold.  And they were coldunder those conditions anywa
y.
 
 
Getting back to thisbridge, they would standthere.T he stories 
we got actually f rom  this cousinof m ine. T hey would go and round
 
--
 
get these people and 
gi ve them ahard tim e.  They would take the child, tear it out of their m other's arm s, andbash
 

the child againstthe rock.  And while them other was pleading, andonly then, would they 
throw the m other in.  
So when you hear stories like this,all of a sudden you becom ea believer.  
Bef ore we couldn't rationalize it
, b
ut now we realize things are really happening. 
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  So given those stories that were com ing back, did yourf am ily
 
--
 
did 
you and yourfam ily ever thinkabout going into hiding?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Yes.  W ethoughtof  going intohiding, def initely becausemy father was t
hat 
type.  But problem was we had no place to go. W e didn't have the meansto do it.  Not like in 

the UnitedStates youcould go to work, get in a car, get on atrain. Over there,f irstof all, if  
you hadthe means, where were you going to go?  You couldn't even trust
 
--
 
like I say, the 
population where we lived were against the governm ent, yet we couldn't even trust them . W e 

didn't know whom  to trust.

Inf act, we were thinking of  leaving m y sisters with som e 
neighbors. And the neighbors would have readily taken them . But then we were worried that 
oneof  theother neighbors would point them out to thepolice andthen they would be left alone 
andthey would pick them upby them selves.  So we had to make choices.  So we decidedto 
st ick t o ge t he r
.  
 
Of c
ourse, in spite what we heard
 
--
 
we never heardof  
Auschwitz, by the wa y,  at all.W e heardof massacre. So whathappened
 
--
 
I could goon, but 
I ' ll ju s t  s k ip .  
 
 
In 1944,f inally, we wer e like mostof  the Jews  f rom the other 
part, like Poland, Lithuania, 
all those parts ofthe world
; 
they took them outtothat part and 
killed them enm asse.  But our part they lef tf or later.  Because atf irst the Hungarian 
governm ent said we were citizens and they didn't want to give us up
, b
ut then, even though 
they didn't like usand they m istreatedus, howe ver they f eltthat we still belonged there.
 
So about 1944 they m ade a deal. And whenthe Germans came toaskf or the Jews again, this 
tim e they said,oh, you want them ? Sure.  
 
 
So the governm ent
 
--
 
by the way, they had a change in 
governm ent,too.  Andthe governm ent went to work and two months, wasn't theGermansbut 
the Hungarians,picked up150,000 people, intwo m onths. They shipped them out to 
Auschwitz.  Later we found out it was Auschwit z.  So outof those,believe it or not, I would 
dare say that 80% of them never cam eback.  That gives you an idea
,  yo
u know, of what 
happened.
  
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
 
So we were picked up, sent to the ghetto.  From there we were 
sent to Auschwitz.  Now we were wor ried
 b
ecause we were putona 
train.
  
By the way, there 
were boxcars.  You took a tour. W e were going 125, 135 people per box car. T his is women 
and children, nof acilities no water, nothing. Locked in there.
  
Now, of  course, all we had was 
fear.  Nothing else.  By the tim e we came to Auschwitz, quite af ew people onthe cars died 

because they were old, they suffocated, or the children were cryin g,  screaming, were hungry.
 
 
W ecame to Auschwit z.  It was atnight, about 12:00.W e pulled 
into cam p.  Again, Im ust emphasize we never  hea
r d of A u s ch wi t z.   W e he a r d of
, 
lik e  I  sa id
,  
a ll 
the killings and stuff.  So we should have expected anything. W eknew we cam e into Poland 

we got worried because we heardof all the things that were happening there. 
 
 
T hey hadus disem bark.  As soonas we 
disem barked f rom  the 
train, there were guys there with uniform sand big sticks, like broom sticks, and just strapping 
u s,  
ﬁS
chnell
! ﬂ  ﬁG
et offthe train.
ﬂ
  
So we got off.  Everybody was holding up because it was like 
bedlam . If  there's such a thing ashell, it's the only picture I could think of. T hism ust be it. W e 

were surrounded with flood lights. Like I say, it was at night.  Andall of a sudden we had 
guards with the rif les,finger on the trigger, surrounding us.  
 
 
Until this day Idon't understand
 
why they needed it.  Because, 
numberone, Auschwitz was surrounded, every section of  the camp, barbed wire, electric 
barbed wire.  So you couldn't go anyplace.  Besides, we were scared out of our wits.  But still 
they had guards with nasty police dogs, really nasty dogs.  Everybody was holding outto their 
children andfam ily tr ying to stick together.

As soon as we got off,they separated menf rom the women.  
And then we had to go through
 
--
 
there was an off icer standing with shiny boots, sharp

just like you see inthe movies.  Theonething, they were alwa ys sharp looking.  As 
you passed through, would go like this or likethis. T he lef t would go to the gas cham ber. T he 
right would go to work.  Very sim ple.T hat meansthat
 
--
 
I was, believe it or not, actually 
youngestf rom m y whole town that cam eback. T here were four orf ive other boys.  They were 

actually a year older,technically.  Som ehow we al ways f elt we were  the same age.  And the 
only reason I think I survived, because I wasnot that big, we knew they were going to ask to 
work.  I put on about two or three jackets sowhen I passedthrough, I lookedbigger.  AndI 
think
 
--
 
because most of  m y f riends
 
--
 
not most, all of them  cremated in Auschwitz the f irst 
night out.  But like I say, the otherf our were about m y size, too. W e survi ved
.  S
o it just shows 
you they had lots of people to pickf rom. T hey didn't want too young becausethey wantedyou 
to work in hard labor.
 
 
Luckily, hindsight
 
--
 
oh, they separated us.  Iwent through the 
li
ne and Ipassed. SoI went with m y brotherandm y father, a couple of uncles.  W e wereon 
one side. All of a suddenm y brother was separated.  He was a good, strong,healthy guy.  
T hat's theone that never came back.
  
In them eantim e, while we were standing there, there 
was a little space betweenus andthe groupof  wom en likef rom  here tothat wall over there
, a
 
ver y sm all space.  But it was em pty.  And I noticedm y m other andmy younger sisters.  So I 
said to m y mother

to m y fa the r
:   ﬁY

I'm going to dashacross that space 
and join them  because I'll be able to getfoodor whatever.

able to do that.  So m y father says ok. So I tried to makea dash
a
cro ss t he  spa ce .  A nd  t h is 
fellow, one of thefellows with the uniform , the stick I m entioned
 
--
 
Ifound out later he was 
called a 
K
apoand hewas doing the work, what theGermansasked him todo, to get people 
m oving.  He just grabbed a hold of me, like the back of m y neck,and threw m e back.  "
Y
ou  
can't 
go there!"  Very m ean andnasty.  Ifound outhe was anotherprisoner. Saidtom y father, 
ﬁCan you im agine, another prisoner sonasty?
ﬂ
  
 
 
W ell, guess what.  Next morning If ound out whathedid.  He 
literally sa ved m y lif e.  Had I gone, I would have stayed in Auschwit z that night. At that rate, I 
didn'tnotice, of course, at thetim e, but thenext thing we went into ashower.  They tookaway 
all of  our clothes. They shaved ever ybody's body hair off, all thehair
, e s
pecially older people.  
W eca m e  ou t  on
 
theother side. T hey gave us those striped clothes.  Now we 
be
c am e  r ea l  
Auschwitz prisoners.  T hey marched us up to a barrack, notfar, afew hundred yardsf rom  
where we were. W e cam e to the barracks.  It was like dawn.  It was m iserably cold.  Mind you
, 
this was theend of  May, I think.  It was cold,m iserable, rainy
, s
omuch so it went right through 
you.  And those clothes that they gave us we re like pajam as literally. T hey took away our 

shoes. T hey gave uswooden shoes.
 
 
Anyway, we cam eto our barracks.  Notfar awa y, a few hundred 
yards awa y, there was a big, bigf ire under the pinetrees. Actually, they have a picture of it up 
in the museum  in oneof  the places. And thef lam es were like a long f lame
, l
ike you see in 
Arizona, thesef ires going through. It was similar to that. But a long strip of f ire, thef lam es 

going up.  So we were informedby other prisoners, 
ﬁ
those are your fam ilies.

crem atorium s
 
--
 
by the wa y, we also found out there were crem atorium s.W e never heardof  
the word crematorium .  It didn't exist.  So they had thesebig chim neys with black sm oke. And 
thefunny thing, you could actually sm ell thef lesh burning, the sootwas just falling down, the 
ashes, justfalling down.  It was so cold, and thisf ire, som ebody told u
s ,  th e  c r em at o r i um s  
couldn't handle the volum e so they were burning them in pits on adaily fashion
 
--
 
I m ean, a 
daily basis. 
 

 
T his wenton constantly.  And then lateron,because I've 
researched here inthe m useum , If ound out that they were so m eticulousabout what they did, 

they evenf igured outhow m any bodies they couldburn in 24 hours,countedthe bodies, the 
f lamm ab le  f lu i
ds they were using.  Mind you, they had everything researched anddone 
m ethodically.  
 
 
Until this day, I couldnever understandthat another nation was 
capable of doing this.
  
And this is very im portant to know.  Oneof  the reasons, it shows you in 
t h is  w
orld, just when you think you are safe,m odern,better.  You have to be very caref ul it 
shouldn't happen again.  Andthis is a lesson learned.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  You were theref or10 days?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Yeah.  A very short tim e. I couldtell you 
a lot m ore about it, but f or the sake 

of  time I'll go ahead.
 
 
Anyway, one day we got orders to goona transport.T hey put 
us on a train. W e went westward this time. The reason we knew
 
--
 
otherwise we wouldn't 
have known, but the reason we knew where we
 
were going is because we came on a delu
g
e

and saw Vienna notf ar off.  Even as a kidI recognized it hadtobeVienna, f rom  pictures, 
whatever. 
 
W e continued onfarther.W e came alongside thisbig, huge m ountain. The train 
stopped. W e disembarked. T hey hadusm arch up to the topof  the m ountain.  Like I say, a 

big m ountain.  
 
 
In them eantim e, we were scared out of our 
wi t s
.   I ' ll t e ll yo u  
wh y.  Ever y single tim e the train stopped, something happened.  You f igured, this is where 
they're going to kill us. W eheard somuch ofthe killing. T hen yourbrain works f unny ways.  I 
rem em ber thinking that way.  T hen wef igured, well, if  they wanted to do that they could have 
done it there.W hy would they bring us here?  You argue with yourself.
 
 
Anyway, we cam eoutat the topof  the m ountain, Mauthausen.  
It turnedout Mauthausen was built on a stone quarry.  T hat's very im portant why I say this.  All 
the walls of  Mauthausen were like f rom  Henry V or som ething, theold castles, the big thick, 
stone walls.  T hey
 
wer e m ining the stone.  The prisoners would bring them up.  And they would 
build this hugefortress of a cam p. Mauthausen was also very sim il ar to Auschwitz, ver y, ver y 

big, ver y big.  T hey didn't gas people like they did inAuschwitz, on that level, but
 
nevertheles
s 
they had gas cham bers.  If they were weak or whatever, they would  send themto the gas 

chamber. 
 
 
T hey also had
 
--
 
Mauthausen, likeI said, it was ahuge cam p.  
But they had a lot of sub
 
cam ps. For a long tim e, I knew it even f rom  the Museum
, there were 
40 sub cam ps.  It turned out because of moreresearch,they were up to about 80.  Up until 

ver y recently they told m e they had only 40.

Anyway, again, I could tell you the story butfor the sakeof  tim e 
I'm  going tom ove. They shippedus to 
one of  the sub
 
cam ps.T hecam p I went to was Melk.  
Some otherpeople went som eplaceelse.
 
 
Now, at that time they hada lot of prisonersf rom  Hungary 
especially.  The Hungarian contingent was, like I say, all done in a very short tim e. Soa lotof  
the n
ew prisoners of Mauthausen were Hungarian. W hat happened is, Mauthausen was also 
a m ixed cam p.  SofarI was talking about Jews, ok?  I want you tounderstand the cam pswere 
f ille d wit h  n o n

Russian POW s. T hey were not supposed tobethere. T here were lots of 
Greeks, Italians.  Ok? Until this day, Idon't know.  T hey m ay havebeen Jewish, but I don't 
know because we couldn't speaktoeach other.  So all the tim e wewere there, we had no 
idea. I don't know if they were Jewish or not. Many of them may have been.  Nevertheless, 
there were a lotf rom  different countries. 
 
 
Needle
s
sto say, the guards
 
--
 
and this is som ething that Im ust 
em phasize.  It always botheredm e.  Most of thepeople that I experienced, whenever I was, 
they notonly did the dirty job, but they were enjoying it.  I can'texplain it.  You could see iton 
theirf aces.  You would thinkm ost of these peoplehadfam ilies, children, or something. 
 
A nd  
som ehow they really enjoyed their work.  Ok?  And this is something that bothers theheckout 

of m e. Infact, I'm going to get you sidetracked a little bit. 
 
 
T he Museum does a lot of  research.  And notlong ago they 
found af ilm  that som ebody took

T hey were doing the work, killing peopleevery day, ever y day, sm elled that stink of burning 
f lesh. They would go home,have thef anciest china they obviously took away f rom the Jews, 
with nice caraf eof  wine. They would have anice dinner
.  T
heir children nicely dressed, with 
the short pants,W agner playing.  T he sam eperson wouldbea loving father, whatever, 

husband, but he was killing thousands of children that day.  Ok? This is something
 -- 
I  s a w 
thatf ilm . I could notbelieve it.  This is how they separatedthem selves.  T hey didn't look at us 

as people. T hey didn't call us people. They called us 
gefangene
, which is a specialnam efor 
a prisoner. 
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  How did that viewpoi nt that they had, how did that translateto the 

conditions you lived under at Melk? W hat was it like there?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Ok. I'll gi ve you a little illustration. That'sa good point. The working camp 

was ver y sim ple.  We worked like three shif ts.  Itdepends on whenyou went to work.  If  you 
went to work 5:00
 
in the morning, you cam e hom e about 2:00,3:00, in the afternoon.  And you 
worked hard. W e worked building tunnels. So it was all hard labor,pic
k
s and shovels. W e 
had to dig the tunnels
. Unlike today.  Useddynam ite and stuff toblast, butotherwise we had 
to do shovel the limestoneand everything by hand.  A conveyor beltwould take some of the 

sandout.  But we had to m ix the cem ent, youknow, concrete, gravel  for

what do 
you 
ca ll it
 
--
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  The wall.  It was a tunnel, right?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  It was a tunnel. T hey hadplatf orm s.  Youhad totake theheavy pails, move 
them  up. Shovel the concretef or thenext level and soon.  It was very hard to do. 
 
T hen we 
wo r
ked with the jackham mers.  I was like 15 years old.  I was not that big.  Plus we didn't eat.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

W e were starving.  Som etim es we had to dothis.  Not like today, alum inum, they had stainless 
steel so they were ver y heavy, above your head,and drill for 10 ho
urs.   Ju st p ict u re .  
 
 
So these things
 
--
 
so people were dying.  The death rate, just to 
gi ve you an example, the cam p I was in was 12,000or sopeople
 i
nthe camp. And every 
single m onth they hadreplaced
 
--
 
3,000people died. T hey replaced them  with 3,0
00 new 
onesthat gives you an ideaof  what thedeath rate was.
 
 
I readanarticle about that,too. T hey had itf igured out. T hey 
wanted to get rid of everybody.  But they wanted some labor out of youf irst.  Sothey had it 
f iguredout that an inmate will
 
only last like two, three years
, w
hatever.  Idon't remember 
the 
exact tim e.  But it was 
a 
very short tim ef ram e of  your life
 
th
at you would succumb.  And this is 
the way they had itf igured.  Now they're ableto get the work outof you, butthey would als
o k ill 
you at the sam e time.  
 
 
And as f ar as food, they would gi ve us in the m orning
 
--
 
t h is  is  
when tim es were good
 
--
 a  
chunk of bread, which was m ostly sawdust.  Im ean literally.  And a 
cup of
 
--
 
it was like a brothf rom  sugarbeadsthat youusefor cattle. So that was like a tea.  
T hat wasf or breakf ast.  At noon they would bring out to thef ield, wherever you worked, they 

would have like garbage can, like 
kettle s
,they would bring it out.  It was called 
Verarbeitungserzeugnissen
. It was a horrible, horrible
-
tasting, dehydrated vegetables, stew, or 
whatever you want to call it.  It was sohorrid. T he sm ell was so offensive.  I rem em ber you 
couldn't even pass the sm ell to eat it. But guess what? W e ate it.  Ok? 
 
 
I remember, I was sm arter than som epeople.  Som epeopleate

21
 
thebread atone time.  I would sort of save apieceof  itfor later in the day.  And that was very 
sm art, hindsight.  
 
 
But anywa y, this was the good times. W edidn't know it was the 
good times. Because later on it got worst.
  
By the way, conditions, again, were so brutal.  And 
ever y single thing that they were able to make worse for you they woulddo
.  T
o give 
illu s t ra t io n
, w
e worked with cem ent
; w
e had cem entbags.  During the winter, you had to stand 
on a platform to waitfor a train that was high up on thef ield. So the wind was blo wing ri gh t 
through you. The clothes were pajam as.T hey were not even clothes. W e could not get close 
to each oth
er. W e had to stand at attention. So som e men would take thosebags and put 
them  undertheir jacket, under their shirt, even though they were f ullof  cement,and they would 

itch and all of that.  But to act like a wind breaker.  
 
 
And you wouldn't believe it.  I remem ber com ing backf rom  the 
m idnight shif t, likeabout 1:00, 2:00
 
in the morning. W hether going outf rom the cam por leave 
the camp, they would count usnotonce butf ive, six tim es each way tom ake surenobody was 

m issing. T hey were ve ry caref ul about that. Anyway, som etimes the Lager com ing down, the 
big shot,he would come and 1:00, 2:00
 
in them orning standat the gate,have the guards 
check, random  checkpeople thathad thesebags.  And guess what he would do. Give them  

25 lashes.  Ok?  
He wouldn't do it.  He would have a special trained group.  Somehow they 
were Spaniards.  Don't ask me why.  T hey we re theonly ones who had a very good life. They 

had tailor made
 
--
 
same prisoner uniform s we had, but they were tailor
-
m ade, pressed, sharp
.  
T hey hada nice hat. They looked like they cam eoutof am ovie, like outof  a picture. They 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

22
 
were trained to do nothing but give these lashes. W ell, Idon't have to tell you, whenthey got 
f inished with us, man, believe m e, it wasn't [Inaudible]of  th
is  wo rld .
  
This is just oneof  the 
things
 
--
 
som ehow you ask yourself  what kind of  people were they? T his is whathappened.
 
 
Anyway, I'll jum p aheadfor the sakeof  tim e. Next we went to 
the Russians
 
--
 
the Russians and theAmericans were closing inf rom
 
all sides. W e were 
evacuated back to Mauthausen.
 
 
Andby the way, in Melk, like I say, it was people of all different 
nationalities
, l
ikeI say, f rom every country.  Ok?  And we were all treat
ed
 
the sam ebasically.  
W eall lived anddiedthe sam e way.  But they took us back to Mauthausen.W e cam eto 

Mauthausen. This time they took us
 
--
 
they cam e in to them ain cam pand they separated out 
all the Jews, separate. They putus on the side of the mountain which was like a neglected 

area, thorny bushes and stuff like that you couldn't evenf inda place to sit down.  At thattime 
we were really, reall y like zombies.  It was just plain starved. T henwe realized the reason they 
separated us
 
--
 
why would they dothat? Obviousl y they want to kill us. They're n
ot going to 
kill ever ybody, but they're going to kill us.  Sowe were resigned to that. Butby thattim e you 

were so outof  it,
 
that it didn'tmatter. You knew you were going to die anyway.
 
 
Lo andbehold,af ter we were therea short tim e
 
--
 
I don't 
re m e
m ber exactly how long.  We got the
 
orders we were going on a m arch.  Later on they 
coined it theforcedm arch. T his happenedatalm ost every cam p people were in. W herever 

they were, they m arched them  som eplaceelse
 a
nd usually west wa rd. W hy? Believe it
 
or not, 
the soldiers were af raid tobe capturedby the Russians so they m oved everybody west war d so

23
 
they were captured by the Americans ortheEnglish.
 
 
Anyway, we went on aforced march.  Somebody fell down.  
T hey would just shoot them there just like a dog.  Infact,onthe march, justto give you one 
lit t le  in c id e nt
, 
I remember we were going on a country road. Therewas a potatoon the 
ground. Thisf ellow saw the potato.  He leapedfor it.  Another guy saw the sam epotato. He 

jum pedfor it as well.  Well, guess what. T hey startedf ighting over the potato. And oneof the 
guards
 
--
 
by the way, they were not SS. T hese were regular Arm y.  They were supposed to be 
the good guys.  Ok? Ihate to seethe bad guys.  Just took out his rifle and shot the guy
 
right in 
theface, in thef ront. I'm  not going to give you the details.  You seethis.  Another guy
 
--
 
we  
were going on a country road. T here was Alpha or something growi ng.  It was just a matter of  

jum ping off likef rom here tothere.  You know, handf ulof  it. T he guards saw him .  He shot him  
right there
 b
ecause hewent outof  line.
 
 
W ereached a place called Gunskirchenaf ter af ew days. W e 
cam e toGunskirchen. Andby now we were r eally
 
--
 
I say each time really, but, you know, we 
were reall y, reall
y 
--
 
so m eof  us were barely alive.  But as luck would have it
 
--
 
and it shows  
you I was lucky, in m any ways.  As soonas Icam e to 
G u n skirche n  
--
 
by the way, this was a 
fairly new cam p.  It was also ina pineforest. There was a lot of water, puddlesonthe ground.  

W hen I got there, whodo
 
--
 
oh. W hile I was in Melk, I was with a cousin of m ine. The same 
barrack. W hen we wer e evacuated, he wentto adiff erent placeandI went toa different place.  

I came to this cam p,to Gunskirchen,and who do 
you 
th
ink I run intobuthis brother.  He was a 
Hungarian labor battalion. The Hungarians were losing. T hey tooka lot of  those peopleand 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
24
 
brought them  into Austria.  They didn't know what to do with them . T hey didn't want to letthem  
loose so they brought them in andput them  into this camp. And when I came there, I run into 
this cousin of m ine.  He was about 20, 23 years old.  He hadabouttwo
 
--
 
a couple of  f riends 
his age. T hey were in fairly good shape yet. T hey had their own clothes, boots. They wer e
, 

com pared tous, terrific.  But because of him , it helpedm e.  All of a sudden I had som ebody to 
lean on
 i
f  you will.  It just shows you how God works in m ysterious ways.  I lef this brother,out 
of  13,000population, I run into him as soon as I got there
.  
 

 
Andby the way, the cam phad only afew barracks.  At night 
ever ybody had to go
 
--
 
during the day, we had to stay outside nomatter the weather.  At night 
you hadto go inthe barracks.  5,000m en ina barrack.  Can you im agine?  Like anArm y 
barrack
,  
5,000 people. The only wa y you wer e able to stand, like sardines pressed, but 
standing rather than laying.  And I was younger thanm ost, so I whittled down, would spend m y 

night just crouched down.  So Idid betterthan som epeople.
  
In the m orning, ther
e were a 
bunch of bodies always.  You had to take them .  
 
 
Andherethings were so bad 
already;
 
even that bread was not 
bread. T he bread was 
--
 
when they tried to give you a pieceof  bread if  you were in lineearlier
, 
th
ey couldn't cut it.  It was a little crum ble. The problem  is, you held out your hand likethis.  
T he problem  was, when you looked at it, it was full of m ildew, blue and white, big chunks of 

m ildew.  And guess what?  You ate it. And like I say, I can'temphasize how bad things were.  
By that tim e,noneof  us expected to come out alive.  You knew they were going to shoot us 
bef ore. W e just knew they were not going to let us go.

So what happened,there were puddles of water. Som em en 
would inadvertently wa lk into this puddle.  It wouldbe alm ost like walking blind. T hey would 
fall down.  I remember them  reaching out likethisf or help. You know something?  You didn't 
bother helping them .Not because we were m ean or we didn't care
, b
ut we f iguredhe's 
already thatf ar gone, let him  die, he'll beoutof  hism isery. W ethought we were doing him a 

favor because they we re thatf ar gone.
 
 
Andback to the shooting part. All of a sudden one day we 
noticed the guards were gone
, b
ut they were not gone.  There weresom e guards,butthey 
were 
diff erent guards. So we heard the Am ericans are here
,  
so it seem s that one of the 
off icers that was lef t behind,to watchover us, the captain went to work.  He took a couple of  
eldersf rom  the camp.  He went out tom eet the Am ericans. W efound that out 
late r. I d idn 't 
know it at the tim e.  When hem et the Am ericans,he told them , look, I have wr itten orders to 
kill ever ybody but I chose not to.  Ok?  So you see,our im aginationwasn't exactly wrong.  
 
 
So he actually
 
--
 
thenwe f oundout we were l iberat
ed.  So a lot 
of  people were leaving the camp. W eheardof  the different incidents that happened bef ore 

thatthey would makebelieve you could goand then kill you outside with m achine guns. So 
we decided to stay anextra night. W e were af raid to leave.
  
Sothe next day we f inally lef t the 
c a m p.   
 
 
First thing we were doing is lookedforfood.  I could go into 
m oredetail, but I'll jumpf or the sakeof  tim e.
 
W e wen t
 
--
 
we came to af ield. W e saw this truck 
in a ditch. It was like in af ield. W e looked
 
inside the cab. There was abig tubof  lard
, a

basin.  And one of  the guys
 
--
 
like I say, they were in good shape. He took hisf ist
, w
ent right 
through the glass. All the glass went into the lard.  But we wantedthe lard because ithas 
som ething to
 
do with food.  So we went on the grass, scooped out the g
l
ass with the lard, 
threw it awa y but saved the

T hen we went to thebackof  the truck and got really excit ed.  
W efounda bunchof hides, ref ined, ready touse. W e got really, really excited.  Oh, we're 
going to take it to a 
s
ho e
maker. Believe it ornot, shoemakers knew how to make shoesf rom  
scratch. Ok? So wef igured we will need shoes.  Not going tof ind shoes.  So each of us got a 

bunch of hides. W e couldn't carry m uch, whatever. W hatever we could carry, we rolled them  
u p .  W ek e pt  on

we saw a farm house not far away.  So we cam eto thefarm house.
 
 
You have to remember, if there was sucha thing as hate
 
--
 
I 
speakform yself ,but we had hate.  After all,the Germ ans did this to us. 
 
W e hated.  I m ean 
there was no such thing as a good German. Ever y Germ an was a Nazi and every Na zi was a 

Germ an to usat thetim e.  Just that simple.Nothing com plicated.And guess what.  Instead of 
behaving like brutes
 
--
 
and to be honest, I started s
peaking here
, f
oryears I forgot about this 
story.  Now I like to include it.  About three,four years af ter I started speaking I sort of 

rem em bered it.
  
I came tothef arm house.  And guess what we did. There was a lady in the 
house.  She was obviously hom ealone. W eknocked on herdoor. Sheopened the door a 

crack.  She askeduswhat we wanted. Oneof  thefellows asks herforf lour, eggs, and water.  
She wentback in the kitchenand brought it to thedoor.  
W
e went 
--
 
never went in the house.  
Never pushed in. One of  the guys m ixed it all up. She hada barn. T here was one of those 

kettles like you see in the m ovies the cowboys used touse

eat up water

wood underneath, make a f ireand heat it up. So we went to thebarn
, m
ade a f ir
e.  W e m ade 
ourf irst mealof  dum plings. W ehad the ingredients. W e hadthe eggs, lard.  It was ourf irst 
m eal.
  
After we were r eally satisf ied with ourselves.  T hef irst tim ewe hadf ood.  Im ean really.  
Yet we had a certain instinct not to overdo it. 
 
Onefellow overrate and he died aday or two 
later
,  
so it just shows you. We were so delicate we couldnot tolerate anyf ood.
 
 
Af ter it was all over, we ate.  Oneof  thefellows suggested
:  y
ou 
know som ething?  Each one of us should take a couple of the leather hides and give it to the 
lady.  And you know? W edid exactly that.  Nobody questioned it, anything.  Took itover and 
said thank youand walked away.  
 
 
T hat bothered me. W hy were we so nice? 
 
Like I say,f or years I 
forgot aboutthat all together. Until thisday I couldnever understand thatdespite
 
--
 
we didn't 
feel likehum an beings.  
T
akem y word f or it. Anything we f elt like, def initely didn't lookor act 
like a humanbeing
, y
et
 
we behaved likea hum an being.  This is why I alwa ys like to include 
this towards the end
b
ecause ourupbringing was such that even though we were diff erent, 
f rom  diff erent fam ilies
,  
that we hada certain value system.  Not oneof  us questions. T he 
G e rm a
ns, why gi ve hides? T hey were untitled to it
;  
go into the kitchen and ra
ns
ack the whole 
place if  we wanted.  Ok?  We didn'tdo it. W e didn't even step intothehouse.  And this is 

som ething I couldnever, never understand. Yet if  somebody would have sai
d here's a gun, 
shoot this guy
, h e
's Germ an, I don't know ifI would have done itbut If elt like I could. Ok?  
 
 
It just shows you how differently we behaved.  In spiteof our 
predicam ent, how we were, we still behaved
 
--
 
to put it simply, I discovered one thing. W e

were hum an after all. 
 
 
I'll sto p  righ t the re . 
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  So Marty, we have beenactually so blessed and so honored to have 
you tell about your experiences,to tell aboutyour insights today. W e
 
are at the end of  the 
program , although Marty will be around totalk with peopleand to say helloaf terwards.
 
 
I will thank everybody for com ing and let youknow thathe's 
going to beoutside inthe lobby af terwards, also signing som e books.
 
 
So I think, 
Marty, it wo uld be good if we m ake sure
 
--
 
I ' ll t u rn 
back to you one last tim e to see if  there'sanything that you would like to say to close the 

program .  It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
that our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
has the last word.
 
>> MartinW eiss:  I haven't thought about this.  I would like to closeone thing. W e have a lot of 

young people here.  The only thing, when I speak inf ront of young people, I always tell them  
one thing
,  
thateach one of them  is im portant. No matterhow m uchsom ebody belittles 
yo u ,  
don'tbelieve it.  You have the right the sam eas som ebody elsedoes. W e have to always l ook 

out for our next door
;  
if it's a school,a bully pushes somebody around, you can'tallow them  to 
do that.  You have to stand upf or them . Sooner or later your turn will come.  And if  we protect 

eachother, we have less to worry about it. I think especially f or young people that'sa good 
thing to know.  
 
 
And with all the stink I hear every so of ten,bullying in school 
and stuff, it's very im portant to know that a bully wi ll pick whoever is the weakestor next to 

him . And if  you let him do it, he'll just keep on doing it to som ebodyelse.  T he same thingwith

f  you're pushedaround, if you letyourself  be pushed
.  Y
ou shouldnot allow it
, 
w
hether it's you orf oryour neighbor.  If you protect eachother, we have a right to call 
ourselves civil i zed.  That's the only thing I could say.
 
>> GretchenSkidmore:  Thank you somuch,Marty.  T hank you.
