Interv iew with 
Guta Weintraub 
August 18, 1999 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Answer: Okay, mm-hm, my name is Guta Bla
ss Weintraub. I was born in Poland, in th e 
city of Lódz, the second largest city of Po
land, and I lived there all the time, until the 
beginning of the war. My family consisted 
of four people all together, my self, my  
brother, my mother, my father. We were a 
mi ddle class family, maybe slightly upper 
middle. And life was good. That -- that™s all 
I remember at that time, is little by little it 
started getting worse. To -- to -- to ki
nd of jump  from one to another, okay. 
Question: Well, can you tell me the na
mes of your parents and brother? 
A: Uh-huh. My parents name is Noah Bla
ss, my father. Then 
my  mo th er was Blu ma 
Blass. Her maiden name was Go
ldvasser, and what -- what else? 

Q: Your brother™s name? 
A: Oh, my  brother™s. My brother™s name was 
Moshe Ben Blass. It™ s Hebrew names, and 
they were translated in
t-into Monyek Blass. 
Q: And was he younger or older than you? 
A: He was a year and a half younger than I am
, and he died unfortunately, in a camp  near 
Auschwitz, a camp for men, Brunow. He was th
ere with my father, and after the war I 
found out that they both 
died there. That™s about all I heard about them. 
Q: Were you a particularly religious family? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060

A: Comp aring to religious -- being religious he
re, and being religious in Europe was that 
the -- medium. I mean , just observant Jew, when 
they came to the States, seemed to be as 
religious as the Orthodox ones, practically, b
ecause we took our re
ligion very seriously, 
whether we observed to the po
int where it was fanatic. S o , of
 course, we observed it, but 
not to th e point a Hassidim did. So when  
we came here, I felt myself being quite 
religious. And we belonged to a synagogue he
re, and -- I lived in Charleston, and -- by 
the way. I moved right after I came to the St
ates, I moved to Ch arleston, South Carolina, 
and we made our life over there. And of co ur
se we -- th e first thing where we did, we 
belonged to a synagogue, and it was the Or
thodox synagogue of -- of Charleston.  
Q: But back when 
you were a child, your family wasn™t particularly -- 
A: Oh well, I -- we were observant, quite obse
rvant. We did not do anything that wasn™t 
supposed to, but the -- the diffe
rence may be -- the visible difference was that my father 
wore just regular clothes that everybody is 
wearing, where the Hassi
dim, the Orthodox -- 
ultra Orthodox were wearing their, you know, religious habits, and wha -- whatever. So 
that was the only -- you -- you 
could distinguish a extremel
y religious Jew from just a 
religious Jew. And of course there were Jewi
sh people who were not 
observant at all, but 
they -- everybody knew, and th
ey consider themself being 
Jewish, but they were not 
observant as we were.  
Q: Can you talk about your relationship with 
your parents? Were you very  close to them? 
A: Well, like I said, my life was wonderful 
when  I was growing up. We had a very close 
relationship, very much so wi
th my mother, and my father. 
I admired my father a great

4 
deal. He -- he was el -- actually living, du
ring World War Two in 
Germany. He spoke -- 
spoke eng -- I mean, G -German very well. A
nd I learned to speak German from him, and 
-- and -- well, my brother was too small to --to learn German, but -- and then when the 

war broke out, of course, I was frighten ed be
cause I -- everything th
at was happening was 
so scary and unfamiliar to me th
at I -- I really didn™t know ho
w to look at it. So I remem -
- remember my father always telling me, ﬁDon
™t worry, the German are -- are not going 
to hurt anybody. They are in
tellig ent, educated people, a
nd they will not harm anybod-
body.ﬂ The intelligence and educ
ation might apply to
 them, but the fact of the way they 
behaved like animals, like you know, like -- li
ke -- that remind me ac
tually when -- when 
there was a hunt --  you know, rabbit hunt, or 
deer hunt, or whatever it is in the English 
way, where they let all the dogs run after them
, that just remind me 
of the situation in -- 
in Germany. 
Q: Can you talk about life in 
the -- and I might be pronouncing th is wrong, th e wear -- 
vearts -- 
A: Yeah, it is a small town. 
Q: Ghetto, yeah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: How long were you there, a
nd -- and what was it like there? 
A: Okay, I like to describe th
e town. This was a small town
 with quite a large Jewish 
population. When the war brok
e out, they  were supposed to
 -- or they were, actually, 
making a ghetto in -- in Lódz. And of course 
my -- my father, that was his decision, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
5 
we ga -- went along with it, decided that 
we would move to the small town , maybe the 
Germans will not get there as fast as they get 
first to the large cities,
 which was really the 
fact. And also the reason we went to Vear
shmeek was because my  mo ther was born in 
Vearshmeek, and she still had rel-relatives over 
there, sisters and -- 
yeah, sisters mainly, 
and so on. So we mo ved to 
Vearshmeek, and in the beginning it sim -- seemed to be 
okay, but the fact was that -- that our life 
changed because of not having proper living 
conditions and quarters and so on. So it wa
s difficult, and of course my father™s 

livelihood ceased to exist, becau
se he couldn™t do what he did at home. And at home my 
father had a factory of military uniforms. In 
other words, it was Boy 
Scouts, tha -- I mean 
that led to it, Boy Scout, prepartor -- preparat
ory military, and then he also branched out 
to have sp orts goods like skiing outfits, and 
so on. So  we were doing well, and I don™t 
think he had accumulated a fort
une anywhere, or anything, 
unless I don™t know. But we 
had to leave everything, and just move there.
 My father organized fo r a wagon drawn by 
two horses, and we to ok wh at we could, and th
e -- just went, and of course we were very 
lucky, because somehow we were not distur
b along the -- the way 
to -- you know, cause 
it could have been easily that
 the Germans would stop us and -- and suspect us of doing 
something wrong and so on. So we were 
not stopped, and we 
went straight to 
Vearshmeek. 

Q: What were the living qu
arters like there for you? 
A: In Vearshmeek? 
Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
6 
A: Well, we just occu -- well, first of all,
 the places in Vearshme
ek -- it™s a small town 
comparing to -- to the large c
ity, where you have -- we didn™
t have skyscraper-scrapers, 
but we had build ings three, 
four, five story tall, and -- and in -- in Vearshmeek, the 
majority of the build ings were wooden buildings
, short, you know, one 
story, or whatever 
it is. So, no water in -- in the house, no bathr
ooms, and so on, so of course, it was quite a 
difference. But it would have been  all been go
od if i -- if it had not end the way it ended. 
And also, it was difficult to make ends meet
. When -- during that 
time in Vearshmeek, I 
was 14 years old or so, I -- with a friend of
 mine, we decided to make -- organize a 
kindergarten, which we did in -- in my apartm
ent. My apartment consisted of a kitchen, 
and a larger room where the beds were, a
nd table, whatev er, just -- but we managed 
somewhat, and we had a kinderg
arten, and people were very happy to -- to bring the 
children, because they were ab
le to do other things, althou
gh their businesses a nd so on 
did not -- did not -- almost didn™t exist. But 
still, they were glad to have the children 
away, so I was earning some money. It was 
not a great deal, but it was enough to -- to 
buy food, which was the mo st important thing at that time. [indecipherable] 
Q: An-A nd so you did have enough food. 
And what was sanitation like i-in the -- 
A: Sanitation, well, like I said, there were
 no bathrooms, there were no -- there™s no 
water, but with all this, you get used to it. Wh
en the water was brought in, we used our s -
- the sanitation was basically almo st like before, 
but the fact was that it was a little harder 
to obtain it, you know, to -- 
to work  at it, cause water had to be brought in, and -- and 
they had outies on -- in the backyard and wh at
ever it is. S o  that™s the way -- that™s the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
7 
only way. If we were left alone in peace, we 
would have actually ad
apted to it, but every 
day they  had different regulatio
ns, and finally they formed a 
ghetto, where at this -- to 
this point, there was no ghetto
 in the city, and 
then they made a 
ghetto. Luck -- lucky 
enough where we lived. And this area was going 
to be part of the ghetto, so we didn™t 
have to move. But many other 
people had to move, and what happened then , they made 
them move with us. In other words, we had 
the kitchen, and th -- the bedroom, which was 
a little bit larger than --
 than normally, so we had to sh ar
e this with another family, it was 
a fami ly of a mo ther and daughter, and a hu
sband, and a grandmothe
r, and they all were 
together with us. And th ings begin 
to -- begin to be quite difficult. 
Q: You were doing some teaching at the kindergarten? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: You were doing some teaching w -- at the kinderg arten? 
A: Yes, yes, yes.  
Q: What about your own education? 

A: I started a w -- I had half a year of high 
school. I started -- I finished the -- you know, 
public school, and th en I went to a pu -- to a 
private school. And -- but I always wanted to  
learn, and I always -- and my  parents especi
ally, were very partic
ular, as far as our 
education is concerned. So  I know -- I had a teacher, a -- a group, in group studies where 
I was taking French . I tried to improve on Ge
rman, I was taking Latin
. I wa -- anything, 
anything just cause I was so hungry for kno
wledge. And we also, like I said, we took 
Hebrew, because my -- 
my father wanted my brother to 
-- to learn Hebrew, so we were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
8 
a man was coming for a half an hour, whatev er it is, and was teaching us Hebrew, and -- 
my -- my brother and myself. So -- actually --
 and then I was teaching myself a lot of 
things, cause I was alw ays curious, and so
 -- so that -- that was my education. 
Q: How long did you stay
 in -- in this ghetto? 
A: In this town, we were until 19 -- ninet -- 
beginning of 19 
four -- four -- well, maybe a 
little -- in 1942, beginning of 19
42. And at that time, they ev
idently wanted to -- to get 
everybody out, sent the majority of people to
 -- to concentration camp, and they  had two 

factories over there in Vearshmeek. One wa
s a woodwork  factory,
 which unbelievably 
belonged to my  first cousin. 
A big plant, you know, I don™
t know how many acres of 
land, with wood, and -- and so 
on.  And they  have a -- a tremendous hall where they had 
machinery to cut and polish, 
and whatever it is. And that 
woodwo rk factory was taken 
over by th e Germans to -- and tran sferred to
 produce articles and you know, for the war. 
Like, for example, they manufactured ammun
ition boxes, stretchers, and stuff like that. 

So they took it over completely. Of course, 
my cousin and his family were shot during 
that time. And of co urse, I don™t know if they 
had any heirs to -- to claim it or whatever it 
is, but that was the situation. And of course
 then, like at the end of -- I may wrong as far 
as timing is concerned, but it might have been
 the end of ™43, or 
maybe early beginning 
of ™44, where they dissolved
 the camp where we were. We were working there, and l-
living there, and whatever it is. They arra
nged a area where we were living, like for 
example men in one tremendous room, you kn
ow, in bunk beds, and 
wo men in the other 
one. So it was like a barrack, mostly. And -- 
and we also received one meal a day of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
9 
cooked -- cooked food, 
and then  the rest of it we had 
to  organize ourselves, so some 
people who were from the city 
had brought in money, an d th
ey, since they 
knew the non-
Jewish people on the outside, they were el
bo -- able to communicate with them, and get -- 
get them to bring mo ney for -- bring fo od 
for money, so for th
em it was easier.  For 
myself and my family it was harder, but we survived.  
Q: How long were you in the village all to
taled, before you went
 to the work camp? 
A: Well, we -- we got there the very end of 
1939, you know. That -- 
that would have been  
because they said 
they were going to close th
e ghetto in Lódz in 1940.
 So we just took off 
before the closing of the ghetto, because we 
knew -- or we had an idea that once we are 
closed in the ghetto, we wouldn™t be able
 to get out. So that
™s what happened.  
Q: I want to go back  and ask you -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- one other question about your -- 
A: Sure. 

Q: -- family environment. W-Were y -- were your parents, or was the fami ly particularly 
political in any way, or -- 
what were your politics? 
A: It was -- i-in those days, it was not -- 
there was no possibility from my point of view, 
and for what I remember, for any Jewish pe
rson to be political We just did what we 
supposed to do, what we were oud -- allowed 
to do, and th-there was -- and if there -- we 
were political, it would have been in the area of
 -- of Judaism, and speaking of Palestine 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
10
at that time, and -- and so on. 
But other than  that, we had no 
-- not much to say as far as 
the politics of the country were concerned. 
Q: I™m going to jump ahead
 here, because we™re cove
ring some old ground -- 
A: Fine. 

Q: -- and your -- your doing a very wo nderful job of -- 
A: I am? I -- 
Q: -- cleaning it up [indecipherable] 

A: -- that™s all I remember. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You ask me about it in a 
year, mo st probablywon™t. 

Q: One of the things that -- that we wanted
 to clarify was when you got to -- I™m -- and 
I™m probably pronouncing -- 
A: Vearshmeek. 
Q: No, mosh a -- Moshakow. 

A: Yeah? Myoufka. Oh, that was 
-- okay, first of all I want to
 make it clear. In -- before 
they expelled us, before those, you know, how it -- I --  

Q: Deported? 

A: Yeah, how do you say they 
-- evacuation, okay. No w, before the ev-evacuation from 
Vearshmeek, we had -- Vearshme
ek was a -- it was like a twin
 city. It -- one part was 
Vearshmeek, and the other part was called 
Starachowice. Starachowice were -- was when 

-- where they had a sealed factory. I don™t kn
ow wh at they did befo
re the war in it, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
11
evidently things for economy
, for a -- you know, wh atever 
it is, from -- for Poland. Bu t 
when the Germans came 
in, they transferred that factor
y it -- into doing I don™t know, 
maybe bullets, maybe this, maybe that, I have 
no idea. So this is one place, okay. You 
speaking of Myoufka, it was just
 a place high up on a -- on 
a big hill in the city of 
Starachowice, where they arrang
e for some reason, which is amazin g because I -- I really 
don™t know how they  could have done it so fa
st, unless this area was used for something 
else --  they had little cabins -- cabins there 
and la -- in areas, and they put all of us, 
during the evacuation of Vearshmeek
, they put part of us there,
 and then a part of us in 
another, similar place where they
 had barracks built. They eviden
tly had an idea that this 
is what they were going to do
, because they had to
 work from the beginn
ing to be able to 
-- to have all this done.  

Q: One of the things that we wanted to ha
ve you go over was the attack of the guard , a 
fellow named Shrot. 
A: Oh, well that was about th
e same ti me wh en  
they evacuated us -- us from our -- the 
place in Polish was named Tartuck. In German
, it was called Zagaverker. It all means a f 
-- a wood -- wood factory, okay? When  they  e
xpelled us from over there, they put us all -
- there was a market, like ever
y small city in Europe, and 
even the larger cities had 
marketplaces, and they -- you kn
ow, chased us all through th
e marketplace, put us in 
rows and so on, and a -- did something the same what they did later on in concentration 

camp, like making a selection. This one here, th
is one there, wi -- which meant -- later o n  
we found out, the younger people
 were left to work in the places that were still available, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
12
and they  were producing goods for the Germ
an -- for the Germans, and the older ones 
were moved straight on the trains, and 
they  moved them to Au schwitz and other 
concen tration camps. Okay , well I was among 
them, and of course, we were lucky 
so mew h at. W h en  th ey  to
ok me and my  brother, and -- on 
one side, they put my parents 
on th e other side, I knew wh at was happening.
 I mean, you just -- it was a instinct that 
told me what was happening.
 So, when they we
re running among -- there were hundreds 
and thousands of people, actually, because ther
e was a great number of people that they 
send from other cities to our -- to -- to 
Vearshmeek, because they did it very 
systematically. Not just come 
to every city, and try to dig 
out to -- whatev
er number of 
Jews was there. But they concentrated all 
the Jews from surrounding 
areas, and villages, 
and little towns, into one whic
h was little larg est -- larger. 
And then from over there they 
made the selection and shippe
d the number of people to -- to a concen tration camp , the 
remaining number they situated in different 
areas for work. And prior to it, you know, 
during that selection, I was lucky because 
somehow -- I-I was very brave when I -- when 
I was young, I didn™t feel like anybody coul
d destroy me. You know,
 when  you -- you are 
young, you just -- so I grabbed my  parents 
from the lo -- line nearby, and pulled them in 
front of me, and lucky enough nobody repla -- 
placed them back in the same place, and 
we survived for awhile 
in this camp for -- I think we we
re there for almost two years.  
Q: Can you tell about that attack on the 
guard? A guard  named -- is it Shrot? 

A: Shro t, yes. 

Q: Can you tell me? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
13
A: Yes, well you see, when  we -- when  they 
-- that was after the -- 
after they evacuated 
us, after the time we lived already on -- on a 
ta -- on the Tartuck, 
wh ere the -- you know, 
where we work, after that
 they decided to evacuate us, a
nd put us in concentration camp s. 
So they  one day, with out any 
warning, with out anything, they
 -- they arrived wi -- with 
buses, trucks that were covered with -- with 
canopy or whatever it is, and they just took 
us. They  didn™t even  allow us to take anythi
ng that we wanted, which is a normal reaction 
of anyone that wants to take their things w
ith them. W -- and pack
ed  us on the wagons, 
and we had no idea where we were going. So -- ba
ck -- what they did, they could not take 
us right away to the -- to the wagon -- to the trains to be send away, so they temporarily, 
for two, three days, put -- put us in this 
little area where they had the barracks built, and 
left us over there. And wh -- we waited for th
e train. When we got there, they had a big 
area which was like a yard, you 
know, and then the barracks we
re on the side. And when 
we got there, the area that was supposed  to 
be the yard had two gr
eat, long ditches dug on 
-- like between, you know, six or so yard
s between each other. And we couldn™t 
understand what it was, but quickly we -- we 
find out -- found out what
 it was, cause they 
told us right away the man shou
ld stand on one side of one ditch, the women on the other 
side of that ditch. And then this man th
at I was speaking about shouted who was -- he 
was actually a -- from Ukraine, and -- and th
ey -- in the beginning of the war the 
Germans solicited the -- the Ukraines and give
 them -- you know, to -- to belong -- to do 

the dirty wo rk, you know, and 
have sort of identifying clothes like a -- to make -- make 
us understand th at they belong to th e German
 army . Well these people did all the dirty 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
14
work, so they were, at that tim
e, g o ing to be the ones that 
were going to execute what the 
Germans told them to do. So
, when we were standing on both sides, the German here, 
this Shrot, started speaking 
in German, and said, ﬁYou have
 one minute to -- to be -- to 
say your prayers, and yo
u going to  be shot.ﬂ Just plainly,
 like that. Naturally, you can just 
imagine what happens to -- to a person wh en 
you hear something like that. We were all 
like paralyzed. I mean, I -- I c
ouldn™t even move. The only 
thing was that my  brain was 
work ing. And when  I looked  at
 my mother, I -- and I saw her -- her -- her face was white 
like a sheet of paper, and her heart was 
-- you c -- you could see it was, you know, 
beating so hard I could almo st hear it. A
nd I guess prompted me to do so mething th at 
maybe normally I wouldn™t do. I was so fright
ened fo r her and -- and th ey were the only 
ones that I had. So I -- when he finished 
talking, I simply, wit
hout even thinking any 
more, I jumped out, and he wa
s standing us -- oh, in front 
of me, in front of the -- 
between the two graves, and I jumped, and I 
jump ed on his back, and grabbed him by his 
neck, and I-I always had long fingernails, and 
I -- you know, pressed as hard as I could. 
I™m sure th at I have wounded 
him in some areas. And I rea
lized that if I -- I -- I didn™t 
know wh at else to do, I had no gun or a
nything. And th e only thing I -- I -- at that 
moment, my instinct told me ju
st to cling on his back li -- on 
his back like that, that at -- 
at a point like this, he will not be able to do
 anything to me. Which 
proved to be actually 
correct, because the Germans st
a -- or the Ukraines starte
d screaming, ﬁShoot her, shoot 
her.ﬂ But of course, if they shot me, they wo
uld have sh -shot him, too, so tho -- they 
didn™t do it. In the meantime, 
as I was lying there -- as I wa
s al -- still clinging to  him, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
15
finally we both fell down, and they -- they 
came an d  th ey  pu lled  h im away  fro m me . As 
they pulled him away, I 
realized that, as far as my life 
was concerned is -- it was finished. 
But it took all the situ
ation, and all the development, to
ok  so  mu ch  time, th at i t was 
getting dark outsir -- outside al
ready. And then , wh
en they  pulled him away, they decided 
to shoot me. So they  came to 
him, they told  him shoot the 
beast, you know. In German is, 
sheeza de bestia, mean s shoot the be -- beast.
 And he said I -- and I heard it, m-my 
English was good, and I could 
understand every word  he was saying, and he said, ﬁNo, I 
will not shoot her yet. She must,ﬂ -- the word
 was edwastonsin, must perform, or dance, 
or -- what he meant by it is I -- he wanted 
me to -- to beg for ou
r life and you know, go 
crazy and kiss his feet, or whatever he plan
ned. So he said, ﬁShe must dance a little 
before I shoot her.ﬂ Finally -- and as I fell, 
I -- I decided I was not going to move no 
matter what happens, that I™m not going to  
budge. So they check
ed  me, checked my  
pulse, checked this, and it was -- stupid idiot c
ouldn™t even find a pulse, so they decided 
that I was dead. And what happened -- 
Q: Well, had they shot you at that point? 
A: Not yet, not yet. But then, one person,
 who became my  sister-in-law later -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
A: But then one person, who became my  sist
er-in-law later, a lady, she started crying, 
you know, because people 
didn™t know how to react. They 
didn™t know what was good to 
say, and wh at was bad to say. So she started 
crying, ﬁPlease help her, she mu st have just

fainted.ﬂ And you know, when I heard her sa
y that -- I still rememb
er it to this -- you 
know, you remember every reaction, every -- 
what-whatever I felt. And she -- and I said 
to m-m -- was thinking
 to my self, ﬁMy God, please don™t say anything, I don™t want them 
to know that I am alive.ﬂ A
nd then when they fi
nally pulled me away, they marched all 
the people into the empty barra
cks that they had, you know
, left, you know, unoccupied. 
And -- and there were two barr
acks, and they filled the two 
barracks, you know, they had 
bunkbeds over there. The amount of people 
from our camp  was about 300, so it wasn™t 
such a great number. And they put us in 
the barracks. I was s
till lying down on the 
ground, and suddenly the -- it was 
dark already, and we heard 
American planes -- or were 
-- they were Russian planes
, actually. They  were cruising around an d -- and dropping 
bombs. So we -- we knew about it, and we we
re quite aware of it. 
So they didn™t do 
anything, and th ey had searchlights that they st
opped using, because th
ey were afraid that 
they were going to bomb  -- bomb us. And la
ter, when the bombing stopped, they turned  

on th e searchlight, and they were going roun
d and round, wh ich would put lights on me, 
too, on the area where I was ly
ing down. Anyhow, at that time,
 I realized, and I got used 
to the dark, and I saw the barracks, I had no 
idea that the people were marched into the 
barracks at that time. B u t I was thinking, and 
I se -- and they were on stilts. So I had no 
other place where I could crawl to hide, and I 
just thought that if I do that, maybe that 
will help, and I did that. And as I crawled und
er the barrack,  I heard people walk, and I 
heard voices, even. And I recogn
ized Polish, and Jewish, and I 
-- I -- I realized that these 
were the people that I came with. Because at 
first I thought maybe they were other Jews 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
17
from some other places, and -- and so on. An
d so anyhow, I still was sitting under the 
barrack, and -- and I felt every time I was br
eathing, I felt I -- I was picking the whole 
barrack on my back, you 
know. And nothing was happ
ening after, you know, until 
morning. At dusk in -- I realized -- and I wa
s evidently not far fro
m the little stairs, from 
the you know, barrack. And I saw people walk
ing down, and I saw they were having, you 
know, all shoes, and you know, clogs, and this
 and that, which did not indicate that they 
were s -- people that came from other places, 
that they were inma
tes from the -- from a 
camp. And as I saw this, I decided I will step
 out, and -- I couldn™t sit there underneath 
the ba -- the barrack forever. So  I stepped 
out, and as I came out from undern eath the 
barrack, here were stairs, and where I cameout of the barrack, there was my father, my 
mother, my brother, all in tears, an d terrifi
ed. Because, what happen
ed -- evidently they 
were comm unicating at night, 
and realizing that I -- my  body was not in the same place 
where they shot me. Did I me
ntion about the shoo
ting befo re? No, I did not, you see, 
that™s what happens wh en you don™t -- don™t 
have a -- a schedule. An yhow, after they put 
the people in the barracks, yo
u know, after they marched th
em there, the guy came over 
and shot me. And my head was like this. No
w you most probably 
can still see a scar. I 
can see it. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I can see it. It was right here. But you kno
w, so many years, an
d whatever. So when -- 
he shot me, and since my face was only halfwa
y exposed, and the other half was -- was, 
you know, flush to the ground, 
he -- when he shot me, the bu
llet grazed my  forehead, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
18
I came from one point, out through th e other. So
 I wasn™t hurt greatly, or anything and -- 
and it didn™t even hurt for some reason, I do
n™t know why. Maybe I was too excited. And 
-- 
Q: Was this the f -- who was the person who shot you? 

A: Shro t. 
Q: Shro t? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how close a range was he? 
A: Well, he was standing over me , that™s how
 close, and -- and he missed it. Because it 
could have been obviou
s that when he™s going to shoot 
me, he will shoot me right -- you 
know, I -- right in my head a
ll -- my temple, and be finish
ed with  it, but he did not. 
Maybe he was scared for his own life 
because they we -- started bombing. 
Q: And was he the only one around at that point? 
A: Wh-W ho? 

Q: Just he and you, you 
were lying there, and -- 
A: Y -- no, they -- there were the other -- no
, the other ones, the other Ukrainians, that 
they were  packing everybody 
in the barracks. Now, there might have been a co uple other 
ones with  him. I don™t know, I™m sure there we
re, because since I wasn™t killed yet, you 
know, they thou
ght maybe I™ll jump up again. So -- an
d then they all left. But when the 
bombings stopped, they  eviden tly, like I 
said, communicated among th em, and they 
realized that my body was miss
ing. So, what they assumed th at the Jewish people took 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
19
me, and hid me. And the Jewish people wh en  th
ey found out -- they al
so found out that I 
wasn™t there, because they came and aske
d them where I am, and I was still under the 
barrack. So they said they di
dn™t know. So they 
didn™t -- so the Jews
 thought that the 
Germans took me, that, you know, I was dead
 and the Germans took me, and wanted to 
cover up -- because basically what we later fo
und out, that they di
d not have a order to 
shoot all the people. And this 
is what they wanted to do. 
Without the order they would 
have shot all of us, have -- has -- h a -- it wasn
™t for the incident and the situation that I 
somewhat created not -- not knowing they  woul
d have shot all of us. But since the time 
lapsed, and it got dark, and the bomb ing star
ted, they were worry
ing about their own 
lives, and therefore, all this stopped. And they
 didn™t want to leave us on the grounds, 
because with a mass of people 
like that, you never know what 
they may do. So they were 
afraid of a riot, that they wouldn™t be able
 to control us. So they
 put the people in the 
barracks. And then -- of course, in the mo
rning when I got out 
from the -- under the 
barrack, I was shot. My face -- my face was 
somewhat bloody, but I 
scraped off the mo -- 
most of it, because I was curious what it was,
 and since I had one free hand to be able to 
move, so I -- I touched it, and I realized that
 I wasn™t hurt badly, and I -- and I am still 
alive. So when I c-came out, my parents were a
ll in tears, and shock, and then  wh en they  
realize -- they all realize that 
I am alive, their first instinct
 was to -- to get rid of me 
somewhat. I mean, not that they
 wanted to kill me or anythi
ng like that, but to hide me. 
And they  decided to hide me under a ma ttress.
 It was not a mattress, but it was straw -- to 
hide me under the straw that -- you know. An
d the barrack  was a lo
ng building, on both 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
20
side were bunkbeds. And here in the middl
e was like an alley, you know, all the way 
down. So they marched me, a
nd they -- they put me under 
the straw . And -- all it was a 
few minutes later, or it seemed lik e a few 
min u tes later, this Shrot came, and he was 
entering the barrack from wa -- from one end,
 and walk ing with a gun in  his hand, and 
screaming, ﬁWo ist da bestia?ﬂ Where is 
the beast. If you don™t produce her right -- 
immediate l y, I™m going to shoot everybody else
. So I heard it, and I just knew it was bad, 
and I didn™t want anything to happen to anyb
ody else, and my  parents and my  brother. So  
I stepped out from it, and I knew that was the e
nd of it, and I just simp ly decided that I 
am not going to  be scared, that I am going to 
be proud, and I steppe
d out, and I said in 
German, ﬁHere I am.ﬂ And then he grabbed 
me. Didn™t shoot me. Evid ently he had -- he 
had orders from the German that
 was in charge of all the ba
rracks, of all the Jews in 
Vearshmeek. So  he definitely had the orders
 not to sh oot me. And so he grabbed me by 

my hand, pulled me out and the -- the area -- 
the camp  was wired all around with, I think, 
electric wires, if I™m n o t mistaken. And they 
-- he pulled me out and took me beyond the 
wires, you know, and pushed me in -- into a ca
b -- small cabin wh ere they ke -- had wood 
for fire and coal and so  on. Was just a barely -- a place that I barely could -- could fit, 
because it was loaded w
ith wood and lumb er. And here I wa
s, and then when he closed 
the -- the -- locked the 
-- the cabin, he started shooting in
 the air, bang, bang, bang, you 
know. And the people in con -- 
in the camp had said okay, th
is is the end of me because 
he shot me. Well, that did 
not happen. A few minutes late
r, they send over the -- the 
commander of the whole area, and he came in
 in his big, shiny boots, and guns, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
21
everything, and he started speaking to me be
cause he couldn™t understand wh at happened  
to me. He saw a -- a wound right here, and 
he cou -- he says, ﬁWh-What happened to 
you?ﬂ So I says I -- an d I tried to kind of
 minimize the whole thing and make it into 
something else, that -- not that
 I jumped him, that I wanted 
to play -- pray for my safety, 
and -- and he should leave me. As -- so I ki
nd of did not say anyt
hing, I said I don™t 
know. Then he went to the back  of my  head
, because he wanted to see if the bullet came 
out through there. I had a wound over there, 
but the -- the wound was from the butt of the 
rifle, you know, wh ere they hit me before he 
shot me. So he couldn ™t understand, and he 
says, ﬁWell, how did the bullet come?ﬂ And he
 spoke to me German. ﬁHow did the bullet 
come here, and then -- and -- and you are still
 here?ﬂ I -- I still to
ld him that I didn™t 
know. But anyhow, at that point
, when he finished talking to
 me, questioning me and so 
on, he took me out, and of all 
the things, he took me near the barracks where they had a 
first aid station, you know, yo
u know, kind of a improvised -- just anything. And he took 
me over there and had the people clean out
 -- clean up the woun
d, and put iodine, 
whatever they did, and -- and bandage, and 
that™s all. And then 
they put me in the 
barracks, okay? That was one ph
ase. And then while I wa -- 
I was in the barracks, we -- 
we were waiting, actually, for the -- for the 
trains to come. Th-The train -- the tra -- 
railroad tracks were outside the camp, and 
we were waiting for the trains to come. 
Whatever -- what actually happened, sinc
e the bombing, some of the tracks were 
destroyed, and they  could not come, so they 
had to do it the next day. So th ey came, 
everybody was gathering around, we ha -- an
d they th ought it was a miracle, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
22
how Jewish people always think of a miracl
e. I mean, mo st probably other people, of 
other religion and so  on will -- will kind of asso
ciate  so mething like that with a miracle. 
So he -- everybody was coming to me. I reme
mber distinctly, now that -- a -- a man -- I 
mean, to me, he looked like a older man, he mu
st have been in his early thir -- 30™s, came  
to me, and by th e way he was asking me questi
ons, what happened and so  on, I realized 
that he most probably is a writer. And ch
 -- not changing the story, but -- but getting 
finished with this, after the wa
r I found this man, he lived 
in Israel. I found a book -- no-
not I, but my  brother-in-law found it, cause he
 was working in a -- in -- in a library. He 
found a book written by a guy na
med Moshe Porrot. And he was the one that wrote about 
this incident and everything. Of course, he 
elaborated on it, and 
-- and stretched it, and 
wrote every detail of it. And after the wa
r, when -- when I already had children and 
everything, my oldest 
son decided that this book, since 
it was written after the war, that it 
was supposed to be registered at th e Librar
y of Congress, and soon. And we looked fo r 
it. We found the names, we found all kind 
of things, but we di
d not find the book. 
Anyhow, but it™s still there, so
mewh ere, with my  n ame a n d  
whatever it is on it. So -- 
Q: I™d like to jump 
ahead a little b it -- 
A: Sure. 

Q: -- because we™re still filling in some of the details. 
A: [indecipherable] back and forth. 
Q: When  we haven™t ev en gotten to  the -- 

A: Maybe you will make sense of it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
23
Q: How was it that -- that your mother in Au
schwitz was able to keep her clothing, her -- 
her shoes, and scarf, and even her hair? 
A: How? 

Q: How was it that she was able to keep herclothing, and her shoes,
 and scarf, and garter 

belt, and even her hair? 
A: I didn™t say anything about
 keeping her clothing, we -- in
 Auschwitz we were given -- 
all -- whatever we wore, we had to -- they st
ripped us, yeah. I would like to say that with 
-- you know, with the beginning of wh en they
 took us to Auschwitz, because there is a 
awful lot to it. But nobody 
had any -- their own clothing in Au schwitz, they took 
everything away. 
Q: Oh, I thought it -- after your mo ther had 
died that you had taken some of her -- 
A: No, my mother died
 not in Auschwitz. She died in Ra
vensbrück. So later, she surviv ed 
some time in Auschwitz, and th
en  w h en  th ey  tran sferred  u s
 to Auschwitz, she got sick 
and when we were in viet -- in
 -- in Ravensbrück, she died 
over there after a few weeks. 
She had a stroke, and she died 
over there. It w as cold, it wa
s February, of 19 -- 1945, I 
think. And she -- she died, but
 she survived 
until -- until just about -- I would say about 
two months or so before they saved us. Th
e Swedes came and took a number of Jewish 
people and others -- a -- other people from the camp out, and to safety. 
Q: How long after you went from Auschwitz
 to the next place, did your mo m -- 
A: Ravensbrück. 
Q: Ravensbrück. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
24
A: Ravensbrück is the name in English, I think. 
Q: How long bef -- was it before your mother -- 
A: When we got there, we got there j -- janu 
-- no, it was the end of ™44 -- ™44. And th en, 
actually, it was already ™45, January ™45, caus
e my  birthday was then, and they put us -- 
first of all, we ha -- we were put on a marc
h, and this march was very famous, they called 
it the Death March. Not only because ou -- of 
our group, but they  
were marching people 
from different camps. I -- I don™t know exactly 
wh ere they were marching them, but since 
it was February already -- January, February, I mean, th e march actually occur -- 

occurred in January, okay? So 
they were marching all these people, and it was snowing, 
and freezing, and -- and winters in Poland are ve
ry bad, as bad almost as in -- in some 
areas in Russia. So people were starving, and 
dying, and they were 
also dying of bullets, 
and through -- by th e time we arrived an yone 
-- anyone to our destination, there was 
hardly  anybody left. So we were -- I don™
t -- my  mo ther and I were walking from 
Auschwitz on the middle of a big road, every body -- and through villages or little towns, 
German towns, but everybody 
disappeared, and th ey were hi
dden in their houses, and we 
could even  see them trying to peek out th
rough the windows, becaus
e they evidently had 
strict orders not to be around.
 So -- and nobody was able to he
lp us. Some people tried to 
escape, and -- but the ones who escape we
re  anyhow killed later. S o  that™s what 
happened . 
Q: And how soon after you left 
Auschwitz did your mo ther die? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
25
A: Okay, we -- we went to -- we finally 
arrived in Ravensbrück, wh ich was also a 
concen tration camp, a big one. At
 that time, they didn™t ha
ve all of it -- all the ba -- 
barracks occupied. It was a 
tremendous concentration camp.
 Evidently they send those 
people to -- to a crematoria in [indecipherabl
e] so on, but they got rid of them, whatever 
way it was. So when we got there, it wasn™t 
-- it wasn™t all occupied
, and we were put in 
some barracks, and that was -- th at was alre
ady end of -- end of January. Yeah , exactly, 
yes, that was the end -- end of Janu
ary. Am I saying anything different? 
Q: I -- I was just trying to clarify something 
that -- that Arwin had wa
nted to know about, 
which was ho -- 

A: Well, I knew it was January when we were
 transferred, and we were on a platform 
train, you know, all of us, I don™t know ho
w many people they put on a platform, and it 
was dangerous too, because we could have 
just fallen off while the train was moving. 
Q: Arwin was wondering -- I th -- I™m looking fo r a place in the -- in the video interview, 

where I guess, after your mo ther had died, you had taken -- 

A: She died in Ravensbrück. 
Q: And you had taken her -- some  of her cl
othing and her hair, and I guess Arwin was 
wondering how she had all t
hose things, the scarf, the garter belt, an d her hair. 
A: No, no sh e didn™t. Sh e didn™t have anythi
ng. Maybe you are talking about a spoon, and 

a comb, and this and that, those things, okay
. These things everyb
ody had, because once 
we were put in a concentration camp, they le
t us keep a spoon, and a -- and -- and -- and a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
26
comb, and a little piece of soap. 
These things we had. And th
e clothing that we had were 
awkward clothing th at were given to us by 
the Germans after they took our clothes away. 
Q: What about her hair? Cause 
I think you had said that you cut a little piece of her hair. 
A: Oh well, that was later, when she passed 
away. Well, I -- I would 
like to tell the -- the 
whole story, because that way it is 
-- doesn™t even have a connection. 
Q: N-No that -- we -- it -- it -- 
A: I cut it o -- I cut it away. 

Q: Yeah, it™s not nec -- necessary, because you™
ve already told th e story in  the video. 
A: I know, okay, but so 
why do you need it here? 
Q: W -- just -- we were seeking a clarification on some things -- 
A: Uh-huh, oh, okay. 

Q: -- that -- that Arwin 
had wanted  to know ab out. 
A: Oh, I see, she wanted, okay. 

Q: That™s all. 

A: When I came to the -- I -- wh en they -- when sh
e died, she w -- she had a stroke wh ile 
we were standing outside on a roll call. A
nd it was freezing, and she had evid ently a 
stroke, and she died. So  they made me, and a 
friend of mine carry her to a barrack where 
they called it like a -- they -- 
hospital thing. It was not. They called it revere, which 
evidently in German it means hos
pital. So they asked me to take her over there. We took 
her over there, and put her on a -- on a bunkbe
d, and sh e actually was still alive, and -- 
but they  would not let me attend to her. I do
n™t know what I could have done, but they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
27
chased me out. So that evening, we were 
given -- once a day we we
re ga -- given food, 
you know, soup made out of ol
d, unpeeled potatoes, and wh at
ever stuff it was. So when I 
received that, I took it to -- to this revere, to
 make sh -- make sure that maybe she would 
e-eat something. When I got in
to the place, there were so
me wo men  th at were su ppo sed  
to be nurses, or whatever it is. And when 
s -- they saw me -- and they were Jewish, 
actually -- so one came to me, ﬁOh, you came to
 see your mother, your mother died.ﬂ It 
was a terrible shock to me, I cannot even describe
 it. So I ran -- no, I fainted, actually. At 
that point when they told 
me this, I fainted, and the 
little container with soup and 
everything spilled. Then when 
I came to, I went to her, and -- and all I could do is close 
her eyes, and -- and then they told me I mu
st leave. So you know, I wanted to have 

something from her. I have
 the hair here. And -- 
Q: The necklace is hers? 
A: Beg your pardon? 
Q: The necklace is hers? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Locket. 
A: Yes. So -- what -- the only thing th at I t ook was a pair of shoes that she was wearing. 

How I saved them I™ll never know, but I had th
e whole pair of shoes. They  took pictures 
of the shoes over there, don™t they have evid en ce? 

Q: I didn™t see the [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
28
A: You didn™t see the pictures, but anyhow, th
ey had -- took a picture of the spoon, the 
comb, the soap, and a scarf, and the shoes. Ok
ay, I had two shoes, both of them. And I -- 
later on, when they released 
-- they saved us, the Swedes ca
me and saved us, I was able 
to take it out, although I wasn
™t supposed to because they  we
re afraid of diseases. And 
you know, we were under quaran
tine for a month or five week
s, or so. So I ha-had the 
shoes in a box. I donated one shoe when I we
nt to Israel, and one I still have here. And I 
wanted to  donate it to a mu seum here, but I didn™t want them to throw it on a pile with 
anything else, but they did not want to, or 
couldn™t accommodate me when I wanted them 
to -- to place it all individual as a -- as a 
group, the comb, and the scarf, and the spoon, 
and the sh oes to -- and to put a name on it. It
 meant a awful lot to 
me, an d  it me an t almo st 
as much as having a -- a -- a burial place for 
my mother, a place where -- where there is 
evidence that she existed. Where -- to this day, actually, I 
am s -- very sentimental about 
the idea of having it recorded  anywhere. Like 
for example, unfortunately it™s a sad story. 
I lost my  son -- my  oldest son was sick and 
he died like about 12 years ago, and when I 

put a -- his stone -- when they erected his st one, that tombstone, I also made sure that 
there™ll be evidence of -- of his past, so I wr
ote down th at he was son of survivors, and 
grandson and -- and uncle of Ho locaust victims.
 And I put my  parents name at the end to 
-- to at least have evidence, and have my  pa
rent™s name, my  brother™s name anywhere on 
-- you know, for people -- people will not kno
w anyhow, but the fact that it is there 
makes me feel better. I™m going to do the sa
me thing evide -- I already have written my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
29
epitaph, this -- it most pr
obably sounds awful, but this is
 -- and I wanted also my parents 
name on it, and evidence that they were 
Holocaust victims, and so on. So -- 
Q: You™ve written it already? 
Have you written it already? 
A: I wrote it already, yes. I wrote it, but -- and I give it to my son-in-law, because my 

children didn™t want to hear of it. It was t
oo disturbing taw -- to them. But I am no -- I -- 
I™m sure it™s going to be th
at way written, and I also even
 demanded of my son-in-law 
that should they 
not have enough room on the stone
, to -- to add -- get an additional 
stone, and put -- 
Q: Can -- can you remember what it says? 
A: I have it written here. 

Q: You have it there? 

A: Yeah, but I s -- rig h t there, but it™s scribbled.  
Q: Could we see it later? 
A: Huh? 

Q: Would you mind showing it to me later? 
A: Yeah. I™ll show. I can tell you actually wh
at I wrote. I wrote my  name, you know, 
when  time comes, and the date of birth. I do
n™t know when I™m going
 to die, so they™ll 
have to put it themselv es, and -- and I -- I 
wrote a -- a Holocaust survivor, daughter, 
granddaughter, and sister of Holo caust victim s, and -- and I wrote down , at this resting 
place together -- I mean, I -- I worded it bette
r. To -- to -- for [indecipherable] get it. 
Q: Okay , okay.

A: I scribbled, but I want to, you know, w-w-
wait a second. It is mo rbid, I know it, but 
this is life. If I -- I don™t know when I™m going
 to die, and I am not looking fo rward to it, 
but when I do, I want to make sure that it™
s w ritten only the way I want it. Okay. I says, 
Holo caust survivor, devoted  wi
fe and mo th er, and date and 
whatever. Daughter, sister 
and granddaughter of Holo caust 
vics -- victims. And I got the names of my  parents, Noah 
and Bluma, and Moshe Bear Blass. Israel a
nd Luba Blass, which are my  grandparents, 
and sharin g this resting place -- what did I sa
y here? Fo r everlasting love and eternal pl -- 
peace. And on -- well I still did not get it. Actua
lly, what I said here
, in honor -- honored 
and loving memo ry, or reme mb rance. 
Well, I -- I have to finish it.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: Obviously being a Holo caust survivor is -- 
has mu ch to do with your -- who you are, 
your identity.  
A: Have I what? 

Q: Being a Holocaust survivor
 has a -- much to do with 
who you are, and your identity, 
and how you want to be remembered. 

A: Well, it -- it evidently is so, 
because they say your past is
 -- is dominating, or shaping 
your presents. So, evidently I wo uld havebeen  somebody else. Maybe not emotionally, 
or so on, cause I don™t think that has change
d mu ch, but as -- as a person, I would have 
been somebody else. I always 
wanted to become a physician,
 a doctor and so  on, but so -- 
but i-it did have a influe
nce I -- I would say.  
Q: Do you think about the 
ways that it shaped you, a
nd your p -- and your future 
[indecipherable] 
A: Well, I -- the way did -- yeah -- in a 
way I™m glad the way it made me, in a way, 
because -- but then, you cannot
, everybody™s satisfied with 
-- with what they are, not 
thinking wh at they would be, 
and -- and if they would be ha
ppy, or whatever it is, I don™t 
know that. But it -- I have no 
comp laints about who I am. Of course, I would have liked  
to be smarter, I would la -- I would have liked 
to -- to write a -- a -- write my own story 
properly, and I would like many other things, 
but I evidently am not -- I™m not made for 
that. 

Q: You said you were happy the way 
it made you. H-Ho w did it make you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
32
A: Well, but you see, I -- I do not have any --
 I do not have my -- myself the other way, I 
cannot compare. So, what
ever I am now, this evidently I wa
s -- I was -- I am -- I consider 
my self a good person. I consider my self very 
emotional and -- and caring, and I -- I love 
my  children, and that means mo re than -- than
 you can tell about many people here in this 
country, unfortunately. So I 
don™t think I would be -- want to be another person. Of 
course, if I did not have this
 horrible memory, maybe it would 
be a little bit different. But 
it mase -- makes me more humble, and -- and 
understanding of other 
people™s problems, 
and -- and for one thing, in all my life, a
nd -- and during the time that I was raising my  
children, I have never discrimina
ted against anybody™s religion. 
As a matter of fact, I -- I 
am full of a -- a special respect for people of 
different religion. And I am also interested 
about knowing about different reli gion and so on,
 and always -- as a ma
tter of fact, they 
just had on television something about relig
ion, and -- and I read, and I write, and I -- 
about it. I mean, not write anything that wo
uld be of -- for anybo
dy to read, but for 
myself.  
Q: Looking for my pen. There it is. 
A: What are you looking fo r? 
Q: So, in -- in some ways do 
you think that your experien ce
 made you a mo re tolerant 
person? 
A: Well, yes. I -- I am tolerant, because on 
many occasions there are 
things that happens 
to a person during her lifetime, and so on
, and  so meho w, co mp arin g  to  wh at was 
happening to me, I dismiss the presents that it
 isn™t so bad, and always make it look, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
33
make myself feel better about 
it, and -- than  I normally would 
feel comparing to -- to the 
past, like you know -- so -- 
Q: So you always have that to co
mpare it to, as a reference point. 
A: Well, you cannot help it. Y
ou cannot help it, because how 
do you think of 
anything, or 
say anything tha -- we do ev erything by compar
ison in our life. And how do we know we 
did good? We know that we did better than th e other person, then  we did good, okay. But 

then another person will come and do better 
than us, so how do y
ou go -- y-you cannot 
establish unless you comp are 
with everything like that. 
Q: How did the experience affect your sp
irituality? You hear people say, you know, 
experiencing such a horror made -- made th
em wonder, you know, 
how can there be a 
just God. How did it affect your spirituality? 

A: Oh, as far as re
ligion is concerned? 
Q: Religion, spirituality. 

A: Well, I am still a Jew, a
nd I always will be. I have no
 intention of changing my 
religion. I may not be able to 
be as observant as I should be
, and I realize that, but those 
things somehow don™t -- don™t mean that mu ch
 to me. I don™t know how mu ch you know 
about Jewish religion, do you? 

Q: Some. A little bit. 
A: Some. Well, for example, observant Jew w
ill -- will have a dietary -- observe dietary 
laws -- not that he will eat anything else. No
w, we don™t eat pork, we don™t eat certain -- 

like fish without scales, and so
 on, whatever it is. And we 
don™t eat milk when we eat 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
34
meat. Our animals, cattle or -- or -- or chicke
n, has to be slaughtered in a very merciful 
way. In other words, to a poin
t where it™s almost not -- that 
they don™t feel, you know, the 
-- the act of killing, in other words. And if 
a animal is slaughtered not -- we don™t use 
guns to slaughter the animal. 
It has to be comp letely painless, and totally sudden. Other 
than that, the -- the meat is 
considered un -- unclean to eat
, because the animal suffered, 
and so on. Well, this is as much I understa
nd about it, okay? So -- but I don™t eat meat 
anyhow, so it doesn™t make any difference. 
Q: Well, I -- I wanted to go back and -- an
d pick up the story from wh en the Red Cross 
came in and you were liberated. Can you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- pick the story up from there? 

A: It is such a pity that I cannot speak a
bout everything from the beginning of my  -- be -- 
just before the war started 
[indecipherable] the time would be so important. Then also, 
from that point on, until the end, it would 
have made the most fascinating writing all 
together, and -- and I am upset about it, becaus
e I have it written in -- in parts like this 
situation with this Shrot. So, unfortunately
, maybe someday somebody™s going to make 
su -- sense of all the writings, and the tapes th
at I will have, and put together something. 
Q: You did tell mu ch of the story in the vide
o, leading up to liber
ation. Could you pick 
the story up from  there, and talk about what
 happened once you were liberated from the 
camp? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
35
A: Oh, you want me to, that
 way? Okay . Well, okay, and 
now I have to speak of my  
mother™s death at -- at that time, 
and from then on. 
Now, with my -- 
Q: Well you -- you -- I™m sorry, you have 
talked ab out your mo th er™s death -- 
A: Yes, I -- 
Q: -- in -- in -- in the other interview. 
A: -- I know, but I™ll have to pick up from that point. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Okay . 
Q: Good. 
A: So, when my mother 
died, a week later, they have send 
informati -- or told us that we 
are eligible to be saved, taken out of the 
camp . They  didn™t say by whom, and how, they  
only said that we were going to  be rescued, a
nd allowed to be free, all we have to do is 
come to the office, whatever 
-- wherever the office was, or
 wherever it was. That -- and 
to give our name, and all th
e information, and when the 
time comes, to -- we™ll be 
shipped out. Well, I -- I didn™t believe it, I re
ally didn™t because they did it on so many 
occasions that way, where they were promis
ing the person that you going to -- you -- you 
coming on, like for example in 
the camp where I was in  Vearshmeek, at one time they 
came and they told everybody, is there anyb
ody that™s got relatives in Israel? Well, 
naturally some people did. So  they  found on
e la -- they -- the one 
lady that somehow was 
not afraid to say it, and they
 to ld her, ﬁPack up all your th
ings, whatever you have, and 
we will -- we are going to send you to Israel
.ﬂ Well, it was not true, because what they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
36
did, wh en  she came out of the camp , all her th
ings -- and she was a lady that lived in this 
town , so she had many things with her that sh
e was able to -- to take, and they  shot her, 
and that was all. So of course that -- that 
memory stayed 
with me, and I didn™t believe 
anything they -- they were doing.
 So when I heard this, I said
 oh yes, sure. But then I was 
thinking, I says, I lost my parents, lost 
my  brother, I™m by my self, where am I going to  
go? And I -- I really didn™t want
 to, I had no desire to live,
 because I was hungry all the 
time. I was miserable, I had no 
place to -- to be comfortable for minute, or anything. So  it 
was very, very distressful and painful for me. So I really di
dn™t care to live any more. So 
I says, well, that™s a god -- a 
good way out, I am just going
 to go, and let them do 
whatever they want to with me. And I sign
ed up. And I had two fri
ends from before the 
war yet, that we happened to 
be together as school girls, and I made them do the same, 
because they -- they relied on 
what I wanted to do. So th
ey came too, and sure enough 
two days later, they -- three -- three or four la
rge buses, t h ey looked
 like -- like streetcars, 
you know, they remo ved all the j
unk, or wh atever it is, for people to be able to be there, 
and they  put us on there. They came with -- w
ith some provision, fo od and stuff like that, 
and they took us in -- they took 
us to Swed en. We had to  go by -- 
Q: I™m sorry, wh at was it that you signed up fo r? 

A: To -- to g -- get on the tran sport to -- they should
 not kill me, that I 
-- I™m -- they am -- 
they going to -- m -- a 
-- how do you say it, I don™t know.
 That I was going to survive the 
camp, and they were going to take me out to a
nother country, or to it -- that I am going to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
37
be free. And that was very hard to understand,
 we just didn™t believe it. So, what they did 
-- 
Q: This is before libera -- this
 is before the liberation.  

A: Oh yeah, you see, I was 
liberated when I wa
s in Sweden already. So the Swedish 
trucks came, and they had food -- canned food
, and stuff, whatever they could. And they 
gave us food, and -- and we we
re driving -- riding thro ugh -- by land, Denmark, and then  
to Swed en. From Denmark we had to go by -- 
by boat, I think. Isn™t it bal -- Baltic Sea? 
Anyhow, yes, so then th
ey took us to -- we were in Co
penhagen fo r awhile, on the trains, 
because they transferred us on trains, after 
the buses, and we stayed
 there, and do -- we 
actually slept there, and they gave us food, 
because they were afraid of getting diseases. 
So -- and then from the trains, we were taking
 on a ship . And the ship  took us to a port in 
Sweden. It was -- forgot the name of it, it 
was Checkenhaven, that™s how you pronounced  
it in Swedish, it was a port in 
Sweden where we arrive. From
 there they took us to a 
special places, because they 
expected us, and they paid 
-- paid for us actually, with 

coffee, penicillin, and aspirin. Those -- the Ge rmans needed it, so 
they release I don™t 
know how many people, three, 400 people of 
different religion, Polish, an-and -- and 
Jewish, and whatever it is, it did not make a
ny difference at that time, but only the ones 
that signed up for it. So they -- those were 
the people that they 
-- that they we-were 
saved, and we were under quarantine togeth
er, and I was there with my  belongings, with  
my mother™s things, and they
 didn™t take it away. And we were there for a month, and 
they dis -- they distributed us, or send us to
 different places, where they were going to  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
38
accept us to work. Like, I was ta
ken to a hotel in Oopsalla. It™s a most historic c -- c -- 
city in s -- i -- in Sweden, and also  the -- th
e oldest college -- university cities in Europe. 
So I was there, and I worked there, and then
 later on I found out about my -- not relatives, 
but I found out about my  frie
nd whom I knew before the war -- not before the war, but 
actually during the war, before the concentra
tion camp . And he fo und me, and he wrote a 
letter, and this is how I came -- and he was in
 Germany at that time,
 so from Sweden they 
allowed me to go to Germany, they pol -- 
paid my  transportation, and from  -- no, 
basically it wasn™t that way. They send me to
 Poland because they could not send me to a 
foreign country, because they 
had -- they were sending me to
 my native country, so they 
send me to Poland. And in Po
land, m- my  friend, he was -- he became my  husband later 
on -- knew where I was, and he send so mebody to
 take me to Germany, and this is how 

we got together, and we got married.  
Q: What -- what -- 
A: Would you like to  have something to drink? 

Q: Do you want to take a little break? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I-Is this goi
ng to be on it? 
Q: No, no, we™ll stop it. 

A: Going to have to er
ase a awful lot when -- 
Q: No, we™ll jus -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
39
A: -- what [indecipherable] 
Q: Mm-hm. Now, during th is period when  you
 were going from Copenhagen to  Poland to 
Germany, was -- 
A: No, first we went from Copenhagen to Sweden. 

Q: Was the war over at this point? 
A: Not yet, not yet.
 The war ended May 10
th
, and we were -- we left February. 
Q: So who was it that wa
s transporting you around? 
A: Well, first of all, we were transported by
 buses, and a very young Swedish man, as a 
matter of fact, my age at that time, althou
gh so me were Jewish that volunteered. You 
know how it is, you know, just like the people
 that volunteer now to go to Greece, and so 
on, to go to Turkey. So
 they volunteered, and they were
 driving. There was one attendant, 
and one driver, or maybe both
 of them and they were ch
anging, you know, places. And 
they took us to Cope
nhagen, okay? From over there, we 
went by train -- no, by sea to 
Sweden. And from -- from Swed
en -- no, we -- I lived in Sw
eden for about eight, nine 
months, and then wh en all this has develope
d that you could hear from different people, 
and about different people, it can correspond 
and so  on, and th at was the time when my  
husband wrote a letter to the es -- ac-actually, 
it wasn™t my husband that wrote the letter, 

it was my  brother-in-law that wrote a letter 
looking fo r his sister-in-law, and I was n-not 
even close to being a sister-in-law or anything,
 but they  eviden tly give priority to  people 
that were related, you know, and looking fo r 
them. So the letter came to me from him, 
and once we established our places, and were 
able to correspond, then we -- my husband 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
40
arranged what I told you before, that I had 
to come to Poland, fro
m Poland I went to 
Berlin, because that™s where he was. He 
had to wait because he found his father 
somewhere, and he had to wait for his father to
 come to Berlin. So, we
 all came to Berlin, 
from Berlin we went to a camp, a -- oh my Go
d, what was it? Buch -- no, I forgot already 
the name of the camp. Anyhow
 -- Bergen-Belsen, okay, it was camp  of Bergen-Belsen. 
And of co urse, the concentration camp  was co
mp letely flattened, burned and everything. 
There was no sign of concen tration camp . Af
ter the war, you know, and th-there was so 
mu ch typhus and ev erything. So  it was burne
d down, and I am not sure if that was the 
only reason that they burned  
it down, they just wanted to burn the eviden
ce. And -- but 
nearby, like a couple miles away from the ca
mp, was a camp  where the Germans were -- 
I don™t know exactly what it 
was there bef-before the war, but it did not look like it was 
especially built for them or anything, there we
re brick duplexes built,
 and th-the Germans 
occupied it, the ones that overseed the concen
tration camp and so on. So they  occupied 
the camp. Well, after the war, th
ey put -- the Germans left, na
turally, and they put all the 
people from concentration camps, mo st of them
 were sick and so  on, and he -- they put 
them into all their apartm
ents and the houses, whatev
er. And they immediately  
established -- they were doctors that came 
there from the States, and -- and from Canada, 
and they establish, you know, just like a 
little -- tiny, little comple
x -- living complex like 
-- it wasn™t big enough to be a village, but it 
was like a camp, and they
 assisted the Jews, 
and there were all kind of newcomers that
 would come from concen tration camp s all 
over. They had no place to go, and 
they found out that this wa
s the point of gathering on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
41
this -- you know. So th ey woul
d come over there, and that™s
 where we lived. We lived 
there for several months, and -- and that™s wh
ere we got married, too. And when -- after 
that, we had to go to Stuttgart. In Stuttgart,
 evidently, we were able
 to organize transport 
to [indecipherable] the United 
States. By then we already -- my  husband established 
where his brother was living, and he was livi
ng in  -- in Chicago. I discovered purely by 
accident, through a man that wa
s in the army from Canada -- 
he lived -- cause when he 
was telling me that his family was from Vearsh
meek, and so on. So I got all excited, and 
I told him -- and I told him ab
out my family, that
 my -- my grandmot
her lived in -- in 
Toronto. So , through him I found out my  rela
tives, and then I found the aunt, and -- and -
- and -- in Charleston. And -- and that™s how
 I came to Charleston.
 You know, it™s so 
confusing to remember about all these pl
aces, when you went, 
and when you came. 
Anyhow, this is -- through him, purely by 
accident, I found out -- 
I had no in formation, 
but I found all this from him, and I was able to
 get in touch with my relatives in Canada, I 

visited them later, a
nd then whatever.  
Q: Was there any romance between Leon and you
 in -- in -- before the -- during the war? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, th -- not before the 
war. That was a funny in cident, too. When  we 
lived already where I -- where 
I told you the place, before th
ey took us to this camp in 
Vearshmeek, and at that time they were ac
tually concentrating all the people from 
different towns, no -- small villag es and town
s, in ve -- in Vearshmeek. And my father 
borro wed a sewing machine, that was before I 
-- I had kinderg arten. 
And he decided to -- 
to sew things. He didn™t know how to sew, bu
t he -- he knew how to  cut, and prepare the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
42
material, an d I knew how to se
w. So we did many things for 
people, like most of them -- 
people were coming, and th ey wanted like 
a one piece suit, and 
you know, pockets, and 
this, and my  husband-to -be came
 to our place, and he wanted
 my father to make a suit 
with different hidden pockets here, and here, 
and here, and whatev er 
it is. So my father 
was doing it for him, and I was the one that wa
s sewing it. And that was the time I met -- 
met him. H e was sitting in our room with -- 
as big as this here, here, and a couch, and 
bed, and wh atever it is. And -- and I rememb er
 when he came, he had money, he saved 
money. He was -- they were very rich, and 
we went through a -- a time where my father 
left everything, and the money was not availa
ble, because either it was in a bank, or 
whatever it was. So whatever he brought w
ith them back to Vear
shmeek was not that 
much to -- but Leon had all this
, as a matter of fact, he had it 
hidden in a shoe -- in a heel 
of a shoe. And so -- anyhow -- so the reason
 I am saying it, because he came with a 
maybe five or 10 pound bag of apples, and 
he was sitting on the couch, and eating one 
apple after the other, which st
ruck me funny. And we were not able to buy that, and 

maybe bought three, four apples for everybody.
 One -- and so this is
 how I remember him 
the first time. And th en, when we were in 
-- you are tired already, huh? And th en wh en 
we were moved to the camp, he was moved to
 Myoufka at that time, okay? And I already 
lived in this camp, and -- but they couldn™t esta
blish themself to -- to
 the point wh ere they 
were useful to do anything, they didn™t do 
anything, they were just in a camp, living 
there. So he -- and there was a doctor ther
e that was from my hus band™s hometown, so 
they were friends. So they
, somehow, somewh at made arrangement, my  husband had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
43
diamonds, and money saved, an
d whatever. So evid
en tly he bribed  somebody, and it™s 
awful wo rd to use, isn™t it, but it happened. So  th
at they were able to 
transfer him. So they 
trans -- tran sferred him, let™s say this is th
e camp where I was, nearby was a camp which 
was producing electricity, and they  need ed people, so my  husband and this doctor were 
transferred here, okay? So we 
were nearby, and th en I was able to see him, and not once, 
twice, or whatever it is. Then
 they combined all -- the both 
camps into one, cause they 
needed people where we were
. So my husband came, and th
e doctor, and he had a -- a -- 
he was working, they -- a -- oc
cupied him to be the main person to  see to people that got 
wounded during the work, and 
so on. So that™s how I met 
my  husband, and very casual 
and so on. But somehow, we kne
w each other, evidently he thou
ght more of it than I did, 
because he took, you kn
ow, all the pain to find me afte
r the war, you know. And when he 
found me, and when I -- and when
 they wrote, I was glad in a way, cause it was the only 
person that was looking for me. So I -- I ca
me to Poland, and I came to Germany, and 
then we went to Bergen-Belse
n, and we lived there until we were able to go to -- to 
Hamburg and wait for the ship to
 come to the 
-- to America. 
Q: And what year were you married? 

A: We got married in s -- 50 -- May ™55. No, wait a sec, six -- ™56. No, w-was it -- was it 

-- no, sic -- 40. My  God, yes, ™46, May ™46. 
The war ended in ™45, in -- in May, and -- 
and I meanwhile was in Sw eden  and came ba
ck, and whatever it -- 
yeah, that™s when it 
was. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
44
Q: When  and where -- what year
 did you find out, or wh at 
-- when did you find out and 
how, about the fate of yo
ur father and brother? 
A: Well, I found out -- first of all, I was l
ooking, and I couldn™t find them. And they were 
very efficient because we were writing to 
different Jewish organizations who were 
occupying themself, and making a point of 
finding people, and they  did not find. But 
then, later on, I found from the people who were
 in the same camp and whatever it is, or 
whatever, bits and pieces of information that
 he was sick, and that was in Brunow, a 
camp near Auschwitz. It was a ca
mp for -- for men, and that 
one person was sure that my  
brother died, because he saw him in a very bad 
state, an d then my fa
ther most probably ti 
-- dead, too. And if he did not, then the -- th
e -- at time w h en they went on this march 
camp, which was the same time th at we we
nt, he might have not survived  the camp , 
either, because I was never able to find him. 
That was all evidence 
and information I got. 
Q: And you found th at out pre
tty soon after the war ended? 
A: More about after they ended, because I go
t pictures, and -- from people that -- that had 

bits of pieces of -- from either -- I don™t kn
ow how they had it, don™t ask me h o w, but 
they -- they somehow obtained some little pictur
es here and there. Because we -- we were 
not able to bring pictures 
or anything, cause you know, wh en -- wh en  I arrived in 
Auschwitz, and they were taking us to -- they 
said to showers, and this and that, when 
they stripped our clothes, we -- w e thought th
at they were taking us to cremato rium. But 
of course, it did not happen, it happened  differe
nt. So when they took 
us there, I had with  
me some pictures, and money -- little money,
 which mean -- meant nothing. And they --

that was the only pictures I had, and th e Ge
rmans would not let us take anything when  
they -- when we went in the showers, and we
 -- we thought we were
 going to be gassed. 
And so they told us only to 
take the soap, and whatever. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
A: -- meant nothing, and they -- that was the 
only pictures I had, and the Germans would 
not let us take anything when  they -- when we
 went in the showers, and we -- we thought 
we were going to be gassed. And so  they to ld 
us only to take the so
ap, and whatever it is 
in. But we came out the other way of the -- of 
the room, and we didn™t have anything. So  
they -- we were given some clothes, and some 
didn™t fit, and of course in -- in a way we 
were able to trade it with the people that got
 too large clothes, to get it smaller, and 
whatever it is. And the clothes 
consisted only of -- of overdre
ss, and clogs, and that™s all. 
We didn™t have any underg arment
s or any, and that™s -- that™s
 all we were given. So  we 
just really didn™t have anything. 

Q: Tell me about coming to America, what 
that was like, and wh at your impressions 
were. 

A: Yes, I would like to speak about that, becau
se it made -- first of all, a -- I was looking 

every -- everywhere if I was not going to be
 oppressed, and -- and 
brutalized, and -- and 
hurt, and wh atever, just -- I didn™t know wh at
 to expect. And I was amazed, I was amazed 
that actually there was kindness that I c
ould notice in people™s eyes, and behavior, 

whatever it is. Of course, I did not need anyt
hing, because I was alre
ady going to be taken 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
46
care, and helped by my relatives that waite
d for me. Ellis Island -- I think at that time 
Ellis Island was still in operatio
n, 50 - 55 years ago, don™t you 
think so? So -- so I didn™t 
need any specific help or anything, but -- a
nd when  I came to Charleston, I didn™t need 
that either, because my aunt 
helped us find a little apartmen
t, and we lived very, very 
limited. I mean, basically poorly
 on -- comparing to 
how I lived in Euro
pe before the war, 
but everything was good because
 of the fact that we we
re no oppressed, and -- and 
discriminated against, and so on. And I was 
amazed, I couldn™t believe it. Then, I mean, I 
-- f-for example, I went to a doctor, you k
now, like in the proce
ss of -- of living in 
Charleston, I -- I had to find a doctor for di
fferent -- you know, you 
get -- all of a sudden 
you get illnesses when you didn
™t even feel anything before. And I found a doctor who 
was not Jewish, and I didn™t even think anythi
ng about it. And he wa
s so kind that -- that 
when I -- when I thinkabout him to this day, I -- I have to cry, because that™s how kind 
he was to me. So, really, all 
these things like that, putting t
ogether, contributed to -- to -- 
in a way to my  recovery , and believing in 
human goodness, and so on. So I was very, 
very happy to see that, and ve
ry amazed. I mean, I -- I -- th
ings did not cease to amaze 
me, as it -- as it came alon
g. Like, for example, why -- 
I don™t know whether I should 
mention that, but I was not aware in those 
days of the situati
on between blacks and 
whites. Because all I knew is from movies, a
nd I -- I could not find anything basically 

bad and discriminating, you know, that whites 
did to blacks. But then , for example, on -- 
in Charleston you -- it was obvious that blacks 
were supposed to sit 
to the back of the 
bus, and they were announcing, actually, for 
-- you know, people to vacate to the -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
47
front area, and whatever it is. So, it -- it ups
ets me -- it u p set me a lot, but there was 
nothing I could do. Then another thing that I 
noticed, for example, black people in -- in 
Charleston were very kind. I -- I™m not talk
ing about young people 
-- very young people, 
because they were either very
 young people, or kids, so yo
u don™t expect of them to 
behave differently. But people sort of a little
 b it older, you know, where I walked -- when 
I walked the streets, or someth
ing, I noticed that they were 
taking off their hat, and they  
were greeting me. And I couldn
™t understand why -- why -- why. I came to my aunt once, 
and I asked her, ﬁWhy do people greet me 
here all the time?ﬂ I says, ﬁI don™t know 
them.ﬂ So she said it was a -- a custom fo
r them to do that. So, I -- I thought it was 
remarkable, and felt very sorry about it when
 I, later on, understood what was going on. 
That™s all. 

Q: Did you speak English when  
you first came to America? 
A: I have a very good background of Latin
, and in German also. And I was able to 
translate things, but only th
e reading -- when I was read
ing it. When people were 
speaking to me, it all sounded
 like, you know, jumble bumb
le, whatever it is. A nd I had 
difficulties, but I made my point to learn how 
to speak. I -- my first book was, ﬁThe Good 
Earth.ﬂ Can you imagine to try to un -- the re
ason I picked, ﬁThe Go od Earth,ﬂ because I 
read it in Polish, and therefore I -- if I didn™t understand it all, I wo
uld j -- kind of make 
believe that I do, and whatever it is
. And that was the first book I read. 
Q: What did your husband do fo
r work  to support yourself? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
48
A: Yes, well my  husband, when  we came -- a
nd I told  you that my  aunt and my uncle 
were the ones that sponsored us, and they help
ed us a little bit. A
nd my -- my uncle had a 
-- a supermarket, but the supermarket was not 
what -- what you call a supermarket now, it 
was a grocery store, a large grocery store,and people were picking their own stuff, and 
then coming to the register, 
so it was like a supermarket. So, since my  husband learned -- 
my  husband was actually a businessman before
 the war, and he was like about nine years 
older than I am, so he was already a young ma
n, able to work and -- and sustain himself. 
And -- and in -- in Charleston, he evidently, 
since he did not have 
anything else that he 
could understand well, he w-was work ing in 
the busin ess of grocery. And a year and a 
half later, h e was able to buy a grocery st
ore, a supermarket from a person -- of course, 
we didn™t have any money to b
uy it, but he was paying for it 
monthly as -- as it went, and 
then we had a supermarket that we -- we move
d to another part of town , and -- so he was 
doing th is, and then  I was helping him. And th
en later on, he went in the business of 
wrecking. Wrecking was very prominent in 
a way that everybody was -- was wrecking. 
They had houses from before 
the Civil War, and whatever it 
is. And they had, in -- in 
those days they were building 
houses with old English brick, and those are the original 
bricks that were sent by ship from Englan
d, they were larger. And -- and the wrecking 

was -- was very lucrative, be
cause they were saving -- af
ter wrecking it, they were 
cleaning the bricks, and they we
re reselling them, and they were a big -- it was important, 
it was a novelty, it was -- it was history. So th ey
 saved the brick, and people were able to 
make lots of money. So  then he was worki
ng -- of course, he was only superv ising th em, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
49
and how he knew about it, I™ll 
never know. He was supervisi
ng, and e-employing people, 
and paying them. He wasn™t doi
ng the origin al wrecking by 
himself. And this is how -- 
and he did well. We did well, a
nd we were thrifty. Oh yes, 
there™s something else I would 
like to speak about. When my 
children were born and of sc
hool age, I -- what™s that? 
Q: A siren. 
A: Yeah? It sounded like voic
es, scared me. Anyh
ow, when the childre
n beco -- became 
of school age, since I was very well taken care 
of as a child and schooled properly -- i-in 
other wo rds I went to a kin-kindergarten, a 
private, Jewish owned kinderg arten, it™s not 
that a -- a Jewish was -- they did not have any 
other kin-kinderg arten. So I had to go to a -
- a Jewish kindergarten. It™s not -- I would -- 
the reason I™m trying to mention it to you, it 
was not because it was Jewish or not Jewish. 
But then I was in school, and then -- and 
schools in Poland were divide
d, Jewish people, and non-Jewi
sh. So, we went to school 
Sunday, and the non-Jewish children went to 
their school on Saturday, so that was the 
different. And also, when I finished sixth grad
e, and of course I could have gone to the 
seventh grade, but since fortunately I was agood student, and I -- I also studied with -- 

with help , so I was advanced, and I was able
 to go to high school. And th e high school 
used to call in -- in European
, we used to call you gimn asiu
m. Which translates evidently 
gymnasium here, but -- but that™s not what it 
was. Gimn asium was the higher education, 
like high school. And so  I went to a private hi
gh school, and of course I wasn™t there long 
enough, cause the war started, and the German
s occupied our schools, and we were not 
able to be there any mo re, because my schoo
l was only girls school. So we were not able 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
50
to be there, because young so
ldiers and everything. And ther
e were horrible things that 
were going on, they  were raping, and ev erythi
ng. So we were -- we
 -- they closed the 
school. So th at was it, but s-schooling for my
 parents meant awful lot, education and so 
on. And yeah, e -- speaking of education, my 
z -- my  brother went to a school that was 
basically Hebrew, but of course, Polish was le
arned, and just like if he went to  a day 
school where, you know. And so 
we were really very carefully taken care of, as far as 
education is concerned. So  naturally, when  
I became a mo ther, and my  children started 
going to school, I felt like I -- I -- I was th
inking th e same way, 
and -- although schools 
were different, and better, and -- in Charlest
on, schools were segregated, you know, so 
you -- it™s not that it was better or worse, bu
t -- but they  had good schools, so -- but I 
didn™t care about it. My sons went to a m
ilitary school, like childre
n™s military, the -- you 
know, the grade school. And th
ey were wearing uniforms, a
nd everything, just like -- like 
regular military, but children. An d my  daughter went to a -- a s-school, and it was 
famous, it still is famo us. It™s called Ashleigh
 Hall, where it -- it was just for girls, and 
there were a -- it was a board ing school too, 
if somebody needed it. 
So my -- my children 
were very good ta-taking care of, and 
all of them, I™m v ery proud of them. 

Q: You have two sons, I -- 

A: I had -- I had four sons. 
Q: Four sons? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And their names? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
51
A: Norman. Norman Joseph was my  oldest s
on. Maurice Howard  is my  second son, he 
lives in Charleston now. Then I have Richard 
Ivan , and Stanley Paul, 
and well, my  oldest 
daughter is Blanche Do rothy, an d my  youngest 
daughter is Sherry Lisa Weintraub. They  

all -- actually, most of them 
lived here, except for my son no
w that is practicin g dentistry 
in Charleston. 
Q: How did they get to know about 
your story as a Holocaust survivor? 
A: Well, it actually took a long
 time, because people did not talk. And I had a -- actually, 
no intention to tell them, because it was too 
sad, and young children, I didn™t want to 
occupy th eir minds with this. And -- and -- on 
the other hand yet too, I thought that it was 
bad that I was a priva -- prisoner, and that ma
ybe I did something bad, and I did not want 
to -- to tell the children,
 cause they wouldn™t understand, so I did not. And th erefore, I did 
not. But then, later on, I remember on a couple 
occasions, when I used 
to come to pick up 
my  daughter from school, her -- the principal ca
me to me and -- and asked me if I could 
teach the children French. And I 
told her, I -- I don™t speak French
, I speak just a little bit, 
I have learned a little b it, but that is not en
ough to teach anybody. 
And I told her I could 
maybe as -- instruct them 
in German, but they did not 
have German. But anyhow, the 
point is that they -- that they couldn™t make
 me out wh at I am, and who I am, and they did 
not -- could not make a connection at that ti
me, what was the Holocaust, and what the 
Holo caust did to us. You see, people were co
mpletely ig-ignorant. 
They  knew 
the -- the 
war was bad, but they -- I -- 
they did not know how -- ho
w it reduced us to become 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
52
prisoners, and not -- nobodies, comparing to what we were be fore, and so on. So that™s 
the way it was. 
Q: So how was it that you -- how di
d you tell your -- your children? 
A: Later on, when people started reading a
bout it, and talking about
 it, and -- and writing 
about it. They -- people would come to me
, they ask me to -- to do a interview on 
television, and I did several of them. Then they
 ask me to write some
 things. They didn™t 
-- they ask me to do different things, and spea
k to -- to schools, and -- and educate young 
schoolchildren, and tell them ideas. And -- and 
I was able to do that, and I wanted to do 
it, not only that I was able. And I did my  be
st, and I was pretty busy all the time, and I 

work ed, too. I had my own business that I --
 I was a clothes designer, and I opened up my  

own shop in  a shopping center, and I had to  support my  children later on, wh en my  

husband died, and he died in -- in ™73, which 
is a long time ago. So I still was busy, I had 
articles in the newspaper, and they would in te
rview me, and have me tell them stories, 
and this is how everything came to light. And later on -- in the small cities, actually 

people were talking freely about it, better. 
W h ere in the big cities, like New York, 
Chicago, pe -- people did not crawl out fro
m the woodwork
 until much later. I don™t 
know why. Maybe because there were mo re peop
le in the larger citi
es, where in our -- in 
Charleston, we had maybe five or
 six family of survivors. So
 that™s the way it is, and now 
my  grandchildren know a lot ab
out it, too. On e of my  granddaughters wrote a story about 
me, and they had a little combination of storie
s in a -- in a book, where in high school, 
they had to each come 
out with a story, and -- and it wa
s published in a book. And it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
53
published only if it was good, and they we
re giving -- given a grad e for it. So my  
daughter -- my granddaughter did that, and I was 
very proud of it, prou
d of the fact that 
she was interested to know, and so on. And 
they still do, nowadays
 too, I have very 
young grandchildren still, that 
are interested in, and they ma
ke me come to their school, 
and -- and s -- talk to them. Of course, you ha
ve to have a very special approach  for 
children once you are a mo ther yourself, then you
 are able to apply it in a way where they  
will understand it, and it will not be so -- so dr
astic, and shocking to 
them. So that™s the 
way I did it. 

Q: Why did you decided to send
 you sons to military school? 
A: Well, it was not because of 
military in a way, but -- but
 because it was a -- a p rivate 
school. That was the only private school in -- in
 Charleston. And of th
e fact that -- that i-
it was a good school, and the only -- they were 
disciplined in a way,
 but not that they 
needed discipline, cause
 my children were -- were very 
well behave -- behaved, but they 
did have some military  little things that they
 were doing. Like, for 
example, they had a 
roll call in the morning before th
ey entered classes,  they stay
ed on attention when things 
were happen ing, and they were
 dressed military. So it was -- 
it was like a boost to their 
personality, cause they felt like th
ey were somebodies. And -- an
d this is what I felt that 
should be instilled u
pon them, because I, during the wa
r, lost all this. You know, the 
importance, and the -- the assurance, and -- a
nd whatever. So -- and 
then it was a private 
school that -- that I was in favor of, and therefore I did it. 

Q: Did you feel patriotic, and did 
you feel like you were an American? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
54
A: Oh, I am still patriotic. I still feel that wa
y. I -- I felt to -- I™m 
still getting choked up -- 
I felt that w ay, and I feel that way all the tim
e when it comes to -- to 
different things, like, 
for example, if you see on television different 
things that we are doing, or this, like for 
example, they send people now 
to -- to Turkey
 to a -- assist them in saving the people 
from the ra -- from the earthquake. I feel choked
 up, and I feel like crying, and I am very 
proud of it. And then, one day I was, for ex
ample, in a s-store, where the clerk was a 
young Jewish boy, a Ru ssian. Well, I didn™t kn
ow if he was Jewish, or not Jewish, or 
whatever it is. And I said something, not conn
ecting, or referring to -- to his English, and 
-- because it was obviously with
 a Russian accent, and I can 
detect it immediately. So it 
was not the reason for that, but I said somethi
ng, and he said to me, ﬁThis is America.ﬂ 
You know, like proudly, see, because they ju
st escaped from the -- from Russia. There is 
lots of people here from Russia. And when 
I found out, I says, ﬁWhy do you say that?ﬂ 
He says, ﬁWell, I™m h appy to be
 here.ﬂ And he told me he™s
 going to  college already, and 
so on. And then, in the 
process of -- of t-talking, he told  me he was Jewish, because we 

were talking. I says, ﬁWell, how -- how are yo
u able to be -- go to  college already? Your 
English is,ﬂ -- and I didn™t want to insu
lt him, ﬁis good, but is it good enough for 
college?ﬂ He says, ﬁYes. Besides,ﬂ he says, ﬁI
 am Jew ish, and Jewish people are smart.ﬂ 
Because -- you know, because wh
atever, I don™t know, I was proud of what he said. It™s 
not that I necessarily feel that way. I™m pr
oud of my self, and I™m 
proud of being Jewish, 
and proud of wh atever it is you have to. So  -- 
but this is the -- and it struck me. I says, 
ﬁMy God, isn™t that wonderful?ﬂ And -- and 
-- and I always feel that way about the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
55
United States, feel about it to 
the point wh ere I -- where I can sit and cry because of the 
way I™m being treated here, and because of wh 
-- of the way I was able to grow up he -- 
here, and -- and establish my  life, and -- 
and feel good about it, it™s very important. 
Q: I™ll just change th -- 
[break] Well let me ask you th
is; have you, and do you recall 
experiencing much anti-Semitis m in -- in this country? 
A: I am very upset with it, I™m
 very upset with it. I -- as --
 personally did not feel it, and 
if it was so me -- someb
ody anti-Semitic that was in contac
t with me, or a -- they did not 
show any evidence tha -- 
how he felt. But of cou -- of co ur
se I am very upset when they 
still do it. But to be honest, unf
ortunately, not that it mak es me
 feel better, we are not the 
only group that -- that they are anti -- you know
. There are a -- I see the same thing th ey 
feel about Chin ese people, about, still, Africa
n people, or still Indian people. Whatever it 
is, they -- they feel that way.
 So not that it -- I feel better 
being in  a crowd, but I realize 
that I™m not the only one that is that way.
 And then I have great belief, and strong 

appreciation for -- for the Jewish people that
 establish their life here in America, and 
what they  contributed. Makes me proud. So -- 
Q: Tell me about the trip that
 you took to Germany to be 
a witness. How -- how did this 
come about? 
A: Oh, the first trip was incredible. 
Q: What year was that? 
A: Hm? 

Q: What year was that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
56
A: ™69. I -- I -- evidently some people
 that knew me from Vearshmeek, because 
incredibly enough, most of the people, all th
e 300 of -- other people that -- that were 
saved by me -- I mean, I -- that 
was not my idea that -- th at I developed, and realized that, 
but the people were telling me that I saved 
them, because most of 
them live in New York, 
and -- and in Israel. When I came to Israel 
once for a visit, there was a gr-group of people 
that was present when all this happened, an
d they invited me with a purpose. I didn™t 
know that, I just thought I was going to  vis
it them, that -- you 
know, just to -- to 
remember them, because I was not a -- born in
 Vearshmeek, I was just a newcomer, but 
they knew  me enough from hearing about me
, or little, you know, in touch with -- with 
me here, and there for a reason. So when I ca
me to visit them, they
 surprised me to a 
point where I really was sitting and crying fo r half an hour. Becaus
e they had the little get 
together, invited everybody who knew me, a
nd when I came in, they s-screamed, ﬁOur 
hero is here.ﬂ And then they made me believe
 that I was the one that
 was instrumental in 
saving th em. And then , wh en I started thinking ab out it, it really was so, because -- not 
that I planned it that way, because I didn™
t plan it that way. But it happened though, 
because I -- I kind of messed up their timing,and it was dark, and then the planes were 

flying, and they couldn™t finish what they wa
nted to do, and th e next day it was already 

known to  the -- to the commander, and he didn™t
 want that way. He says, ﬁWhy should I 
kill them here, let them go to -- to Auschwitz,
 let them do whatever 
they want to.ﬂ So, 
therefore, they -- they did 
not kill us. So he 
didn™t want anybody, and besides it, the 
Germans themself were angry wh
en the people f -- the U k rain
e people did things without 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
57
their specific instructi
on. They felt like they 
are the masters, and they are -- they are the 
ones to tell them what to do, and whatev er it is, so -- what -- what was the -- 
Q: That your trip to Germany as a -- as a witness. 

A: Oh yeah. So anyhow -- I got sidetracked
, right? I always do that. Anyhow, where -- 
when  people found out, they started being in
terested in the Jewish -- people started 
interest -- b e-become interest
ed about the crimes, and -- a
nd you know, an
d so on. And 
when they found someb
ody that was guilty of crimes ag
ainst the Jewish people, they -- 
they made a trial, okay? The Germans them
s -- themselves wanted
 to. So, wh
en  th ey  
found out that I was a very st
rong witness against this guy,
 because I had something to 
show myself for, and I was a w
itness when they -- from the camp
 where I was, I told you, 
in Vearshmeek, and where my
 husband was already there. And th e docto r -- there was 
outbreak of typhus, and there 
were seven people who were sick. And the seven people, 
they just didn™t want to cure them and do an
ything, although they  would have surviv ed. 
They  made us put them on stretchers -- you 
know, the stretchers that we produced, and 
take them to the cemeter -- cemetery. And on
 this cemetery, they had a big grave dug, 
and they  made those people kneel down -- th
ere were seven only, 
seven or eight -- and 
shoot them. So I was a witness 
of that, which was absolutely
 -- I mean he killed s-single-
handedly, seven people. And that
™s enough to be con-convicted if you kill one, right? S -- 
and then he wanted to k
ill me, an d didn™t su-succeed. 
Q: This was -- this was the fellow Sch -- Shrot. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060

A: Shrot. But there was another one that didthis killing. You know, that was not the same 
one, but -- 
Q: Oh, two -- two men named Sh rot? 

A: No, no, no. He was the one 
-- the one that killed the child
ren was another one. But he 
was brought to trial at the same
 time with the other one, with
 Shrot. So I -- I was witness 
to wh at he did to me, and I witn ess to the 
other things. And, of course, we came -- the 
German government actually paid for the tr
ip, because I would have never spent money 
ke -- I didn™t have it. And I would have not done it to see that the -- the Germans that -- 
that did such horrible atrocities -- I was scared . The first time we finally arrived in 
Hamburg, and we were steppi
ng down, I -- I felt like I w as 
absolutely going to have a 
heart attack to -- to -- to put my  feet on the 
German soil, to feel -- you know, that they did 
all this and so on. It was a terrible experien
ce, I -- I didn™t want to, but I -- I had to. And I 
think my husband was with me 
at that time, too,because I 
didn™t want to go by my self. 
So it -- it was aw-awful experience. 

Q: Were the men themselves there, on trial? 
A: He was there, yes, he was there. And he 
remembered , because I told him that he shot 
me, which he did, and he intended to shoot 
everybody else, which he
 did. And then he 
told -- told that 
I jumped him, which was true, and I didn™t object to it any more, because 
it was true. He was there, but they -- the -- he was coming -- 
End of Tape Two, Side B

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
A: -- this was true, he was there, but they 
-- the -- he was coming to the trial ev ery day 
with a suitcase, and documents and everythi
ng, like a big businessman. He was not in 
jail. He was coming on his own, and they  
didn™t do an ything to him, because he was 
jailed in Russia, right after the war, I think. 
Either he remained in
 Russia where they -- 
when -- when they were in Ru
ssia, you know, trying to  -- to beat the Russians, or he 
actually escaped Germany, and 
-- and Poland, because of the 
fact that he was doing all 
these awful things, and -- and he went to Ru
ssia, or maybe there were -- he did some 
things for the -- to the -- agai nst the Russian people, and th
at™s why they got him in -- 
jailed in Russia. So, because of the fact th
at h e was in -- in jail for two years, or 
something like that, they didn™t want -- they 
didn™t do an ything to him. In other word s, 
the fact that he killed so 
many people just didn™t meke
 -- make any difference.  
Q: What was that like facing him, so -- 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: What was that like facing him so many years later? 
A: It was terrible, it was disgusting, cause he
 was dressed beau tiful, he was acting like he 
was a important person. He had his special 
b ooth where he was s
itting down nec -- nec -- 
on both sides of him here was a translator, wh
atever it was, Polish, or -- or whoever was, 
from another country . And he sat like a very
 important person over there. And that 
reminds me , I don™t know if you were aware, 
that was the trial of Demjanjuk. Have you 
heard of him, that they 
took to -- to Israel -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
60
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: -- and tried him, because he was the -- th
e guy that was in a concentration camp, and 
killing Jews. You her -- you heard of that. 
Q: Sure. 

A: I was -- I happened to be 
at the same time in Israel, a
nd I took my -- my special -- 
special trip to go to 
Jerusalem to be -- to atten d  the tria
l, and I did. And the way -- he was 
-- he learned a little bit of Hebrew, he came -- 
when he came out to his special area where 
he was supposed  to sit, you know, to his sp ecial booth, he came , and he said shalom to 
everybody in Hebrew , and he -- and he al
so was saying [indecipherable] all kind of 
papers, and documents. And he was answering 
questions; there were a number of Israeli 
Holo caust survivors that were witnesses, a
nd were with him, and -- and talked  -- spoke 
against him. Didn™t bother him at all. They
 s -- [phone ringing] Is that my phone? 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- not to -- to the ones that -- th at knew th
em, because I didn™t want to brag , but just 
because you don™t know it,
 am -- I™m saying it. 
Q: Well -- well, can we go back to  the 
-- the trial that you are the witness on -- 
A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: -- and -- and tell me what the ou
tcome was of this fellow Shrot. 
A: Okay, okay. Well he was not -- he was not
 given any sentence any mo re, because that 

he already, you -- you know, 
was doing time. And that™s all, I don™t know wh at happened  
to him later. I -- I had no contro l over it, and all the people that spoke against him, he -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
61
we just didn™t have any control. The fact that
 they did the trial, a
nd went thro ugh th e -- to 
the problems of getting people from -- beca
use there were people from Canada, there 
were people from Australia, there were people
 from all o v er, because after the war, all the 
survivors kind of scattered everywhere. They  
had n -- knew somebody
, that™s where they 
went. Maybe I would have gone
 to Israel, maybe I would have gone anywhere else, but 
why -- why go anywhere else when I had relativ
es here? My aunt -- my mother™s sister 
lived in Charleston, and all my  -- her brothers 
and sister s lived in -- 
the rest of them in 

Toronto. So  that was the reason, and my  husba
nd™s brother lives in Chicago, so -- but it 
was no ch oice. 

Q: What happened to  the other fellow 
who was on trial, the other man who -- 

A: The other one, you know, he was -- first of
 all, he became prominent after the war, he 
wa -- became prominent, he was a mayor of -- 
of a city. I don™t know -- I don™t remember 
which one. And he became pr
ominent, you know, and evid
ently his past was either 
hidden, or unknown, or whatever
 it is, and so I don™t know wh at they did to him. I think 
they jailed him for some time
, because he -- he had obvi
ously killed many, many more 
people, and there were many witnesses. So th
at™s why they -- they 
didn™t -- they didn™t 
execute him, they didn™t 
kill him like they did Eich
mann and the other ones. 
Q: Do you reme mb er his name? 
A: Yes, Becker. B-e-c-k-e-r. Yeah. Of course
, I remember, I™ll rememb
er it til the day I 
die. I just hope I don™t lose my  mi nd before 
th en, I™m so scared of Alzheimer™s disease, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
62
you know, for some reason, I r
eally do -- you notice that I 
ha -- I was forgetting certain 
word s or names. 
Q: I think you™re doing just fine. 

A: Yeah, mm. 

Q: What was his first name? 
A: Becker? Hm, now that I don™t remember, r
eally. I don™t know. Might have been Otto , 
or some -- I don™t remember. 
Q: What about scr -- 
A: William. 
Q: William Becker? 

A: William Shrot was the other one. 

Q: Ah, William Shrot. 
A: Yeah. And it™s spelled S-h-r-o-t-h or t, on
ly t, Shrot. So an -- it was wil -- W ilhelm, 
the way he pronounced it. 
Q: Can you tell me about your 
visit back to Lódz in 1988? 
A: How do you know th at? 

Q: You had mentioned it in the video. 

A: I did? Oh, that was a -- I was already in -- 
oh, that was a be -- rig h t after the war, okay, 
yes. When I came to Poland
, because I -- a few years ago I was in Poland, too. 
Q: Right, I -- that™s what I was referring to, the visit in 1988. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
63
A: Really, I -- you don™t have any mention of
 it here. The Poland was when I came from 
Swed en to Poland. Okay, th-this -- yo 
-- wh ich one you want me to tell you? 
Q: Well, you can tell me about that as we
ll, but I was referring to the 1988 visit. 
A: Oh yes, maybe you™re right. That -- that wa
 -- ya -- then I did mention it, because that 
-- that was after my son died. And I went -- in
 ™88, okay, I went in ™88 to Poland, to 
different cities, and I was in Sweden also, I 
made a sentimental journey to Swed en, and -- 
and yeah, whatever else. 
Q: What was that like going back?  
A: Okay . 
Q: Didn™t you go to
 your childhood home? 
A: To -- the first time? From right after the war? 

Q: No, in ™88. 
A: In ™88. I was with friends, and I was al
ready well rooted, and 
well establish ed, and 
feeling -- feeling American, that -- and I came, 
and I have seen what I have seen. I -- I did 
not feel sentimental ab out the 
Polish people, because they  we
re denouncing us, and they  
were destroying us, and they were stealing 
and taking from us all the time. There was a 
number of Poles that were assisting Jewish
 people and helping th em, there™s no doubt 
about it. But the greater majority was actua
lly waiting to take it away. G -- I™ll tell you a 
little s -- something that will indicate how it 
was. After the war, people were -- late -- 
later after the war, many people would travel to
 Poland to seek thei
r roots, and find out -- 
well, there are some people from Israel that we
nt there, and they went to a -- a -- a city 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
64
where their parents used to liv
e, grandparents and so on. An
d of co urse, they didn™t find 
anybody over there, because th
ey were all gone, and there 
was a little cemetery where 
they could maybe identify with
, or a remnant of a synagogu
e or so on. But they  were 
talking with people living in -- in
 very nice houses, they belo
ng to Jews. Not that it -- the 
Jews were privileged and ha
d th ose houses, but jewis -- Jewish people were wo rking 
hard, and they were a -- a -- improving their 
lives, and their existence, and everything, 
and they  were very particular about it, so th
ey had better houses, and better places to live 
in, they lived better. So 
they were asking this particular fa
mily or person that lived in this 
house, oh, you have a nice house. So they  we
re telling them yes, the Jews had it, now we 
got it. So the person they wanted  was interv
iewed, and I was aski
ng him how and what 
and whatever it is, and they were telling them
 -- which was very, very degrading for -- for 
me to listen, how they were talking about th
e Jewish people that 
were killed, murdered, 
or wh atever it is, and left the house for them, 
they felt lucky that they  had everything, all 
their belongings, and everything. Now, for ex
ample, they -- there was also a in cident 
where they were interviewing children in 
schools. You want a pillow for your back? 
Q: No, that™s okay. 
A: That would be nice interview, hi -- I don™
t really -- I -- I don™t even care any mo re. 
Anyhow, so when th
ey ask children, five year old child
ren, six year old children, do you 
know what a Jew is? N o . You 
know how they look
. So  one kid says, ﬁOh yes, I know, 
they have big ears, and big noses, and they  go
t big teeth, and they  are scary.ﬂ This is how 
children were able to describe Jew ish peop
le, and it™s not li-like that. Of course, in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
65
Europe, Jewish children, I -- I mean Jewish 
people were branded having big noses Here, 
you got everybody, Arabs, the -- the Greeks, 
the -- there -- whatever it is, everybody™s got 
big noses, and it was not especially a trait of 
Jewish people. So, that™s how they described 
the Jewish people over there. And it was upsetting. 
Q: Did you go to your childhood su mmer 
home on that trip in 1988, in Lódz? 
A: Y -- y -- to my summer home? Yes. It was 
not my own, it was where we rented. Yes, 
we went there. There was one lady in Lódz 
that took me -- her husband was driving, and -
- course I was able to pi -- pay them, and I 
brought things for them, because how I found 
out about the person is also a whole, big 
story. But purely by ac
cident, I was writing by 
the name to the person, and the -- the lette
r was received by th ese people of th e same 

name, and whatever it is. And they were not 
Jewish. I was writing to a Jewish friend that 
was supposed to live in -- in Ló
dz, and they received it, and 
as I started writing to them, I 
felt obligated to -- so I was writing, I was al
ways putting money in the -- in the letter, 
because th -- she sounded kind, 
and nice, and whatever it is, a
nd I knew that they were in 
-- lived poorly. So then
 when I came to Lódz, I got in 
touch with -- with her, and of 
course I stayed in a hotel, I didn™t need anythi
ng from them, but they did offer to  take me 
where I wanted to go by car. An d since it wa
s like about I would say two hours away 
from Lódz, they took me over there. And of 
course, I was -- it wa
s on a [indecipherable]. 
So, I cannot even describe how I felt. I -- I 
felt like -- like -- like I could touch everything, 
and -- and it would be the same, and ev ery -- c
ourse, the area -- this was where we used 
to come for vacation, and father
 used to come. That
 -- they took me to the train station, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
66
and I rememb er comi ng and waiting fo r Daddy 
to  come from Lódz, because Daddy used  
to come for the weekend, yo
u know, like Frid ay, and then 
leaving Monday mo rning, an d 
you know, everything was just 
-- just like I could touch it. So I lingered quite a little 
while over there, and she doesn™t know -- sh
e didn™t know wh at I was looking at. And I 
was looking, and I was touching, and I was do
ing things and -- that™s all you can do, there 
is no way you can possibly recove
r anything th at you have lost, 
that™s all. So it was a very 
-- a very touching and emotional mo ment. A
nd of course, it did not look the same 
because they have rebuilt the areas, it™s -- so
 I did not find the house where I was living, 
but the train station looked somewhat similar 
to what -- what I reme
mber. And then when 
we want -- went to the area, they had it re
done, rebuilt, and streets, and ev erything, I -- 
basically I didn™t recognize it. But it was a incr
edible time. And then, of course, the way -

- in Poland, you wouldn™t believe
 it. Like, for example, I w --  
Q: That™s okay, I™m just stretching. 

A: I -- I looked at streets, you know, the main
 streets where there was lots of business, 
where they  had lots of stores, and I know 
fo rtunately, or unfortunate, or some wartby 
whatever it is, those buildings and -- and houses, and -- and businesses belonged to 

Jewish people. So they had signs, for exam
ple, dressmaking, or this, hanging on th e 
entrance of the -- of the air -- 
you know, the -- the areas in Eu
rope had, like for example, 
this was a big courty ard, and the houses were 
bi -- th -- were around, and there was a gate 
here, where you entered, cause that™s how most
 of the houses were, with a -- a -- cl -- 
enclosed in courtyard for everybody. So, 
like on -- at the entrance of the -- of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
67
courty ard, they had different
 signs saying who is doing bu
siness of any kind, like for 
example shoemaker, this and that, whatever. And 
then, in the front of 
the street, they had 
stores, and the stores were saying, like here, 
whatever the store was selling, whatever it 
is. So they still had the same
 size and everything there, 
all -- and of course now, 
restaurants, they still had the 
Jewish restaurants with the sa
me sign. Like, for example, a 
Jewish delicacy is, lik e for example, ha
ve you ever heard of gefilte fish? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Did you really? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Huh. Well, okay. I-It w -- Jewish people 
eat it -- not -- they can eat it any time they 
want to, but it was a custom that for Satu
rday -- Friday and Sa
turday, you made it, 
because we did not have refrige
rations and so on, and it was -- 
we were able to keep it in 
a cold place for a couple days 
to eat, because we were not 
allowed to -- to cook, or do 
anything. So we ate that, and we still do, so 
it™s a very popular dish  for Jews. So anyhow, 
what made me laugh is I saw a restaurant, an
d it says, of course in Po lish, ﬁWe serve 
Jewish gefilte fish.ﬂ N o w, that was in Polish,
 but I™m translating it. And I said, ﬁMy God, 
they didn™t even know how 
to make it.ﬂ You know, if th
ey were not specifically  
instructed to do it. And they 
had busin esses, and Jewish people
 go there. And they -- they 
-- I went there too, cause I -- I had no way -- no 
other way to -- to go to eat. I wasn™t very 
fond of -- of them, and bec -- I was hurt. I 
still had the feeling of -- of the way they 
treated us, still had the taste of it. So I co
uld not warm up in such
 a short time toward 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
68
them. Of course, now, it™s a different generati
on, and it™s different, so I feel differently 
about it. I feel different, I -- differently about 
the Germans, okay? Because first of all, the 
German society is mixed, also, of different groups, of ethnic groups, in different 
countries, and different thing. If Hitler we -- w e
re to be alive, and if he saw his -- his 
cities in Germany, he most 
probably would commit suicide 
becau -- because he wa -- 
wanted -- he was striving to  destroy everybody
 that did not belong in Germany, and he 
wanted a clean Germany, only of typical, et
hnic Germans, and no mixtures whatsoever. 
And like I said, I said oh my God, here I came to
 -- to Frankfurt, to the airport, and they 
had groups of Indians from India, okay? Groups
 of people from different, other countries, 
from the Middle East, from here, from that, a
n d  th en  in  th e stre
ets y ou saw Chinese 
people, Chin ese restaurants and ev erything, 
and I looked, and I said, ﬁMy God, it feels 
like I™m in the States.ﬂ And then
 I said t -- th e same thing th at I told you about Hitler, I 
said, ﬁIf Hitler saw this, he would drop dead
 immediately,ﬂ you know. So -- so I don™t 
feel -- I cannot say -- I -- I -- I feel something,
 but I would not say that I feel about every 
German the same way, because it™s a different
 generation. And the time when I went to 
Germany -- Germany, if I saw so mebody that 
was my  age then, I would know that he was 
somebody in  the German army , somebody that
 oppressed the Jewish people, and -- and 

whatever it is, so I would feel very badly. 
But now it™s entirely a different -- different ge-
generation, but of course, you 
still have the an ti-Jewish, yo
u know, anti-Semitic groups 
and so on. Like for example, the group he
re that was supposed to  -- you know -- you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
69
know, go around -- what do you
 call it? They -- an-anti-Nazi
 -- anti-Jews -- Jewish group 
that was supposed to be here last -- last week. 
Q: Oh, th e Ku Klux Klan? 

A: Yeah, yeah, whatever ot -- I 
thought they were just strictly
 anti -- Nazis. O n  a -- they 
are a -- a combination of Ku Klux Klan, an
d whatever, okay. And, you know wh at 
surprises me? That they came,
 and they asked for a permit, and the government gave 
them a permit. Now how could it be? Knowing 
th at these are that kind of people, and 
who -- why doesn™t somebody that belongs here, 
really, and is -- is a true American, a -- 
no matter what religion, whatever it is, do th
ings like that to -- to a -- you know, not 
demonstrate, but to -- to -- to just announce th
at they are here, that we are here, we are -- 
and we are Americans, although we are from 
there, and from where, whatever it is. But 
why allow them to -- to demonstrate, like they 
demonstrated already, twice in Chicago, in 
Skokie, I know. I mean -- and there were fight
s, and there were disturbances. Why -- why 
invite something like that? That™s what surprises me, that we are too lenient here, and too 

-- too mu ch allowing. It shouldn™t be like that, 
there should be a strict -- I -- I don™t want 
to put ideas in anybody™
s head, but there should be c-certain raw -- laws to make sure that 
things like that are not going to  happen. 
Q: That there should be laws to prevent the ma-marches? 
A: Definitely, definitely. Al -- the -- any -- 
any ethnic group, and an
y group could march, 
fine, but not to be idealistic about something 
aga -- which is going to  -- to be ag ainst our -
- our American society. Why should they be 
allowed to -- to be lik
e that, for them to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
70
speak against somebody? If they are not Americ ans, let them get the hell out of there, 
that™s all. F o rgive me for saying [indecipherable] 
Q: That™s okay. It -- it must be frightening to you -- 

A: It was frightening to me -- 

Q: [indecipherable] your experiences. 
A: -- but I -- I almost wish, after I heard wh
at was going on, I almost wish that they -- 
that they were there to demonstrate, beca
use they had several different groups, large 
groups. You know, Jews are not supposed  to 
actually demonstrate or do anything public 
on th e Sabbath, and that was on Saturday . And 
they organized a group -- a Jewish group 
resistance, I don™t know in wh
at ways. I don™t think th-they had arms, or anything, but -- 
but it was a -- a -- a contra -- a acting group, 
and different other gr
oups, you know, that 
they -- but there were lots of blacks because 
the Ku  Kluck-ux Klan  
is against the blacks, 
and -- and this and that. So th
ere were several large groups 
that were -- would overcome, 
no matter how -- and they said they were goi
ng to  have 300 people
 only, and four only 
showed up, right? Flor -- four of the Ku  Klux 
Klan showed up, and th
en they dispersed. 
So I don™t know. But -- so if 
-- if they would have a -- a aw
ful come down to reality, you 
know, or because they would realize that 
there™s no place for anything like that to 
happen, th ere™s no place for them to de -- de
monstrate, and they -- you know. But I don™t 

know. Listen, as long as -- as
 people exist, there is alwa
ys somebody that will come up 
with something somewhere.  
Q: Can you tell me you -- in th
at 1988 visit to Po land -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
71
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- you went to Au schwitz. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Can you tell me about that? And you 
were looking for some photographs? 

A: Yes, yes. You see, I did speak about it. 
Yes. I found -- not photograph. Th-The reason 
I was looking fo r photographs, okay, when  they 
were taking us to -- in Au schwitz, where 
they were taking us to -- to
 the shower, I mentioned to yo
u that I only had photographs 
and things with me. They took
 those away from us. Not that 
they personally came to me 
and took it away, but I had to leave it. So I ha
d -- I was  hoping that they would have the 
photographs in Auschwitz. And they have 
set up a whole place, you know, like a whole 
office in one of the barracks where, you know
, where they were keeping the photographs, 
because they  had a tremendo
us amount of phot
ographs, because everybody was taking 
photographs to the -- to -- to the -- to the camp with them. Th
at -- that was the only th ing 

that was important for us. So, they found a 
awful lot of photograp
hs, millions of them, 
mo st probably, from people that were brought 
into Auschwitz. And so 
they kept it, they 
put them all in one barrack, or two barrack
s, and then they --they segregated the 
photographs, and placed them if they could in
to all cities, if it was evidence that it was 
from this, or another city. And that™s where 
I went. I found my name, Blass, in several 
other cities. I found -- but I did not find an
y photographs that I could un -- I -- read, 
unless they were photographs, 
but you see, I was a very you
ng gi -- I was still a teenager 

when  the war broke out. So 
I couldn™t know th at mu ch, 
and remember. I remembered

72
only that hit me -- that hit close to home, 
and so on. And people 
that I remember were 
only sort of relatives, and maybe some friends
 from school, and so  on. So , I did not know 
very much, but when I saw a name, I could te
ll. I went to the cemetery -- cemetery in 
Warsaw, also, at the trip when 
I was -- that w as when I was in
 Poland, and I made sure th 
-- and I -- I looked, and I found many names, 
Weintraub, and I found names Blass, but I 
do not -- I -- I do not remember of any relativ
e. Course, Weintraub was not my family, it 
was my husband™s family, so he most probab
ly  would have been ab le to distinguish 
better, but I was not able. 
Q: So did you not find the phot
ographs you were looking for? 
A: No, no. I was very disappoi
nted . The photographs that I brought in there, I would have 
found, maybe, if they still were, b u t maybe I wa
sn™t looking in the -- in the right place, 
because like I told y
ou, each barrack had upstairs, and 
downstairs. The first barracks, 
actually, they were made out of brick, and 
concrete. Later on, the other barracks were 
made out of wood. But those, for some reaso n
, I don™t know wh at they were planning to  
do with it, or those were little brick houses.
 So, evidently, they 
planned to have the 
photographs in there, because
 they put them right away. 
But maybe they didn™t -- you 
know, when  you have photographs from people th
at were from different areas, and put in 
one camp, and how -- you cannot 
tell which city, whatever it is. So maybe they were not 
put on -- put away in perspective that I 
could find them. So, I didn™t find anything. 
Q: What was that like emotionally, fo
r you to go back
 to Auschwitz? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
73
A: Emotionally, everything was terrible, terrible. This was not the same emotion as -- as I 
felt being in -- in this small village where I 
used to spend my vacation time. This was an 
entirely different emotion. That was a goo
d feeling, everything was good, like -- like 
touching things that -- that I touched befo
re, or somebody else, my parents, and my 
friends, and whatever touched. This was a bad fe
eling, of -- of what they did, and it just -- 

everything I looked at was -- was taken by forc
e, and whatever, so it was a very horrible 
feeling. 
Q: Was there some healing there, or some use for it? Was it a usef
ul thing, or do you 
wish you hadn™t done it?  
A: No, healing -- there™ll be never healing, in
 my opinion. I never will be healed of it. I 
just get accustomed to it, that™s
 all. I just get a -- to the point where I can talk about it, 
where if you got me here at -- 10 or 15 years a
go, I wouldn™t be able to sit like that and 
talk to you, but now I -- I want really -- a
nd you can notice it mo st probably -- I want to 
get as mu ch as I can out, you k
now, to talk about it. But I -- 
I couldn™t do it before, so as 
be -- as far as being used to it, e -- I-I™m ne
ver used to it. I™m just
 accepting that it was 
that way, not accepting that you don -- y -- I do
n™t know if you understand what I mil -- 
that this was my past, and this is how it was.
 Not that™s the way it was supposed to be, or 
whatever it is. So, I am just bearing no special feelings, because I can -- cannot do 
anything. I cannot change it.  
Q: Can you tell me about your tatt
oo? Did you get that at Auschwitz? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
74
A: Mm-hm, yeah. A140
28. My mother was A0
 -- I mean 29. I remember when I we-went 
to do the tattoo. It was on a -- a late summer 
afternoon. All this tr
ansported came at the 
same time. We were ta -- bei
ng tattooed, of course, wo men se
parate, and we didn™t even 
know what it was. But then w-we saw that 
girl was doing something, I told mother, I 
said, ﬁLet me go first.ﬂ And at that time we di
dn™t have any understa
nding of what was to 
come, yet. I mean, we didn™t expect anythi
ng -- anything like that, at
 all. And I was the 
first one to have that 28, mother had 29. And -- 
Q: Ho -- do you look at it often? 
A: I -- har -- I cannot escape it. Not -- I 
look at it, and I don™t even  -- I don™t -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
A: I -- har -- I cannot escape it. Not -- I look 
at it, and I don™t even  -- I don™t look at it 
with the way you would look at it. You see, I lo
ok at it, I™m used to
 it, it™s part of my 
body, that™s all. And I look at it -- now, I have
 made -- when I was in -- in Florida, I had a 
friend who was a painter, a artist, and the 
Ho lo cau st mo nu men t  in
 Florida is -- is 
remarkable, by a very  known artist. And it does not -- it -- it shows, for example, a hand 
of a person like this, a arm, and he is poin
ting his fingers to the skies like -- like -- not 
praying, but reaching for the sk
y. And here is his number, and this is tr -- a tremendous 
statue, and arm, an-and this is also very  big, 
you know, as tall as th
is room. And so  wh en 
I was there, this artist that 
I know -- knew -- he was a painter, he did for me this -- a 
portrait of the arm, exactly as it w as there, 
and he ro -- and in stead of having another 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
75
number, which evidently the artist put either 
a person™s number that he knew, or maybe 
he was a Holocaust survivor himself, and he
 put his name, so he put my  number on it, 
and then  he wrote down  on the -- over the po
rtrait, Guta Blass Wein
traub, survivor, and 
then it was also my mother™s 
name , and the numb er -- her numbe
r on the arm. S o  I give it 
to one of my  sons, but it could 
be duplicated, you know, taken 
a photo of it to d -- to have 
somebody else have it. I™m very sentimenta
l when it comes to -- 
to reme mb ering, and 
doing so mething in favor of something, and so if -- 
Q: How was it that your mother was able to ke
ep possession of the lo
cket that you have, 
throughout all the things she went through? 

A: That -- that -- that is not -- this is not 
from -- from the concentration camp. I had a lock 
of hair that I took with me
, and -- when  I took the shoes and ev erything. Then  when  I 
came to -- to this country, 
I was able to put the hair in a locket. I was not -- 
Q: Oh, I™m sorry, I thought 
it was the locket itself. 
A: No. 

Q: You have your mo the
r™s hair in the locket. 
A: I -- I would be rich, I would be
 able to -- to buy a piece of 
bread for it, if I h ad gold in 
there. No, we had nothing. 
Q: But you -- you put a lock of
 your mother™s hair in that
 locket, and you carry it around 
with you? 

A: Yes. I still have a whole 
bunch put away, because this 
is destroyed almost, cause I 
don™t even take it off. I use it in the shower, 
and whatever it -- I just be -- don™t take off 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
76
this. And here, my -- the hair is already a 
little clamped up, but y
ou know, I would never 
throw it away, because in Jewish
 religion, you™re not suppos
ed to throw away anything 
that was on a body -- n-not a foreign th ing, 
but something that bel
onged to the body, it 
was growing on the body. You 
are not supposed to throw it 
away, you bury it. Like, for 
example they do in -- in a ho
spital when they have -- make 
autopsies, and everything like 
that, so they -- they pu
t everything in -- in one bag, wh at
™s left over, and they bury it, 
cause at least they have proper burial. So, 
I -- I couldn™t destroy it and throw it away. 
Q: Are there smells, or mu sic, or anything th
at -- that make you thin
k of your experience 
during the Holocaust? 
A: Definitely. You know, there was one so
ng that they were singing, they were 
occupying Jewish mu sicians, 
you know they had a -- a treme
ndous amount of talent in 
concen tration camp. People -- singers, and mu sici
ans, and you name it. And at that time, I 
already -- are you familiar with -- with the so
ng, ﬁBeer Barrel Polka
?ﬂ Yes, da dan dan, 
da dan dan da da ha a -- I -- I am not a si
nger. But anyhow, it was very famous at that 
time, and evidently either it ca
me  from the States, and they adopted  it over there, or vice-
a versa. It was ﬁBeer Ba-Barrel Polka,ﬂ 
and it was a ve ry know
n -- you know, song, 
mu sic. And it was happy mu sic, you know, jolly, 
just like having to do -- beer, you know, 

like -- like it was bursting with 
happiness. Well, this song, 
they were -- so they had a 
Jewish band, they su pplied th
em with to -- instruments, 
and they  had no difficulty 
supplying wa -- with instrument
s, because when somebody wa
s playing a instrument, that 
was one of the most important things that th
ey had, so they  took it to concen tration camp 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
77
with them. So they  had plenty 
of instruments, so they were
 supplying the -- the orchestra 
with instruments, they had violins and -- an
d everything, you know. And they  made them 
play this song when they were
 taking the -- the people to -- 
to the ovens, and wherever 
they were going, whatever th
ey were doing, whatever atro
cities were -- were happening 
at the time, they always played that song. An
d that made me sick, ter -- it still does, you 
know. When I came here later -- a few years la
ter, there was a show on television, I don™t 
remember exactly who it was that
 used to -- th-they were adve
rtising that whoever have -
- has a favorite song, or savorite -- favorite stor
y, not song, to write it, and to -- that was a 
contest for -- for some reason. And I wrote -- I 
still have it, actually, but I would have to 
dig, I don™t know, hundred days 
to dig it out, everything. Is 
-- I wrote a -- a letter to this 
comp any that was soliciting for stories, you know,
 and to d -- it was like something to  tell 
them what -- what was the most important thing 
that influenced the lif
e, or whatever it is, 
I don™t know, with -- with a connection of a 
product that they were selling. Anyhow, I 
wrote a story about the song, and I -- and 
I told  wh at it was connected  with and 
everything, so they accepted it, bu
t they didn™t want to print it.
 They did not want to print 
it that I was the winner of a -- of a story 
like that, because it woul
d be a -- too negative 
for other ethnic groups, n-namely Germans, or wh
atever it is, and after all, there is a great 
population of German people here in
 America. And they did not do it. 
Q: Do you still -- 
do you have dreams a
bout the Holocaust? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
78
A: Yes, yes, yes. I have terrible dreams, a
nd I wake up pe-perspired, and -- and anxious, 
and -- and hurt, and for a while I am so diso
riented that I don™t know where I am, until I 
finally slowly but surely realize. Yes,
 that™s unfortunate, 
but I do that.   
Q: What are the dreams of? 
A: What? Oh, s -- yeah. I have 
seen things in this small to
wn where I was. They were 
punishing people for doing certa
in things, for this and that, like for exampl
e, I thought 
that™s a sil -- sa -- simp le way -- comparis
on. Like they will pan 
-- punish you because 
you are using too mu ch  water, or watering th
e lawn. But in -- in 
Germany they had all 
kind of punishments, too. No
n-Jewish people, and Jewish people. As it happened, some 

non-Jewish people did somethi
ng, and it was five or six pe
ople, and they hung them on 
the market, the same market ba -- that I wa
s telling you, where -- wh
ere they, during the 
evacuation that they put us on. And we -- an d the Jewish people were ordered to  come, 
and -- and -- and watch it. They were forced 
to watch it. So here is a -- you know, a -- 
they built a special -- what -- 
what do you call it, scaffold? 
Okay, where they -- and they 
hung the people, and we had 
to wait until they tu
rned blue, you know
, from the pressure 
of the blood, or wh atever it is. And we wa
tched it, it was the most horrible thing you 
ever, ever saw. Young people -- there was 
older people, and s -- a couple young people, 
right in front of us. And they pulled the thing, 
and that™s what it was. So, of course, I have 

seen later on, in different forms, not exactly
 hanging. I saw shooting, and this and that. 
When they took us to
 this camp in Vearshmeek, you k
now, and when th
ey took us from 
the marketplace into the camp, 
they put men separately and 
women separately, and then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
79
they were searching us, because
 they knew that we had valu
ables, money, because we did 
not come -- of course, ourselves, we didn™t ha
ve mu ch, but people th
at came st -- still 
straight from their home had thin
gs, so they -- and th
ey told people -- 
us ahead, if they 
find any money, if they find any jewelry, we
™ll be shot. And sure enough, th ey searched 
us, and th ey found somebody ha
d some money, wh ich didn™t
 mean anything, you know, 
paper money. And th ey found so me jewelry, 
maybe a -- a wedding ring, or th is or that, 
and they  shot the people in front of me. We
 w ere -- we were standing there, a woman 
here, and a woman here, and th
ey  shot them right here. 

Q: And these are the things that you dream 
about? These are the th
ings that you dream 
about? 
A: Yes. About shooting, about killing, about 
-- terrible. Yeah, of course, it™s -- I -- I 
dream about things that I never even  -- that 
I have never even seen, that -- that after I 
realized what I am dreaming about, what it™
s -- it™s supposed to 
tell me, that it is 
associated with the Holocaust. So
 I -- you know, I™m aware of it. 
Q: Do you have friends, or keep in 
touch with fellow Holocaust survivors? 
A: Yes, I do. No t many, not here, but I had those, you know, out of the seven -- seven or 

s -- eight families over there they
 were survivors. But then I 
have friends in other cities 
and countries. Like I told you, friends in 
Israel, of course, little by little, they are dying 
because they were not young, I was one of th e youngest ones, so they are all either my 

age, or a little older. So they 
are not able to survive. How 
much longer can you survive? 
And in New York and Chicago, and -- yeah, I 
had all over, wherever I came, I w -- used 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
80
to visit my family in Chicago, and I 
used to meet survivors, and -- and I™m 
corresponding, and I had fr -- friend survivors in
 -- in Toronto, Canada, and so  on, yeah. 
But the only ones that I was ab
le to get in touch with cons
tantly, or -- were the ones in 
Charleston, but since I live here, it™s -- I am 
n o t seeking them for some reason, because I 
don™t know them, and just to -- to seek them 
out fo r -- for the purpose of talking about it, 
it™s no sense. 

Q: You came to Rockfeld 12 years ago? 

A: To Auschwitz -- 
Q: No, to Rockfe
ld, to live here. 
A: To Rockfeld, yes.  
Q: Yeah. And -- and can you tell me why it is that you came to Rockfeld? 

A: Why I came, because of my children, because of all -- most of my children lived here, 
and that™s why -- actually, all my  remaining ch
ildren lived here, except for my -- all the 
son that s-stayed behind in Ch arleston, he di
dn™t want to move. A-And th e rest lived here. 
And the one that lives in Charle
ston, he was not well, he had 
diabetes. So he was not able 
-- it™s not like -- anyhow, the children that 
-- that live here, want
ed me to come. My 
oldest daughter insisted I come here, my othe
r children. That™s why 
I came. And I™m still 
sorry, because it was like be
ing uprooted. That™s -- 
Q: You miss Charleston? 
A: Yes. I just came back from Charleston.
 I told you, remember, I wa -- we were 
supposed  to have the meeting in June, and 
I went away . You rememb er, you originally  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
81
made a date with me in June, and you were no
t able to keep it, and I told you I was going 
to be out of town. 
Q: What do you miss mo
st about Charleston? 
A: Everything. Everything. There is nothing th
at I didn™t have in Ch arleston that I have 
here, and -- but I had mo re in Charleston than
 I have here, so -- I k n ow -- I -- I miss my 
friends, I miss everything. Knowing Ch arleston,
 and going places. Life was completely 
easier. Yeah, a small town life is con -- really
 very different from a big town here. Over 
there, wherever I wanted to 
go, I had no problem with park
ing, I didn™t have to wo rk 
streets -- w alk streets to find a parking pl
ace, and then  go ba
ck, and -- and so on. 
Everything was accessible, 
and ka -- it was en tirely different life. It was somewhat still to 
-- to the way it used to be for 
me in -- in Europe, except that
, like I said, we didn™t have 
cars, and that was probably in whole city of
 -- of Lódz, there -- there were maybe 25 cars, 
and not always I would see them on the 
street that I was walking. And so  i -- 
Q: When  did you finally retire from your work ? 

A: From my work, I retired in -- in ™62. 
Q: And what was it that you were doing? 
A: No, no wait a second, no, it wa
sn™t ™62. Sic -- I retired the year I came h -- yeah, wh ich 
-- 
Q: The year you came to Rockfeld? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
82
A: No, no, no, I came here 12 years ago, okay, 
what year was it? 80 -- ™85. Okay, in ™85, I 
retired ™85. I -- I just closed up my store, 
that was my retirement, 
and that™s all -- and 
decided th at I didn™t want to wo rk any mo re.  
Q: And it was a -- a clothing, design store. 

A: Design. I was designing clothes. We -- I wa
s making, of course, and my staff, we were 
making -- like, for example, clothes for a 
whole party, let™s 
say a wedding party, 
bridesmaid™s dresses, and some
 wedding gowns, to a certain 
extent. And other things, and 
whatever. 
Q: How long did you have that business? 
A: 25 years over there. 20 -- 25 years I worked
 in there. Of course, I wasn™t -- I wasn™t 
doing a tremendous business, because when
 you wo rk with your hands, you cannot 

accomplish very much, you know? But, I also 
-- de -- could not -- I could work full time, 
because I had children, and I had 
to attend to them, and make su
re that they were all right 
before I was able to sit there. So, like -- I 
mad e a living, you know, like th -- ends -- end 
to end, and -- and wh atever. But i-it was sati
sfying because it was 
something I liked to 
do, and -- and I did it, and -- and also the fact
 that people were grateful, because whatever 
I did for them, they were gratef -- grateful, 
and -- and praised me and so on. And that was 
a boost. So -- 
Q: What was the name  of the business? 
A: Gusta Blass designing, alterations and 
so on. Was -- I have pictures of it.  

Q: Well, Mrs. Weintraub, we™ve been going for -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060
  
 
 
 
 
83
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- you know, three or four hours here, I th ink I™ll -- 
A: Please don™t forg et sending me the tape, oka
y? I would like that, cause I -- I want this 
to be some evidence for my ch
ildren, and in fo rmation, because I know th at sooner or 
later, they will decide to put the story 
together and -- and -- and do something. 
Q: It™s very important for you to -- to carry on your -- 
A: It™s important for me, a
nd it™s important for them, too. An -And I know th at, but how 
can they do it if all -- 
they will not have information and 
so on. So, this is -- what were 
these notice -- note -- notices that you ate -- made?
