Bef ore we turn to your lif e during the war andthe Holocaust, let's start f irst with you

Sh ilo
:  My fam ily, they all camef rom  a small littletown which was then in 
Poland bef ore 
W or l d W ar 
I  
--
 
was in Austria
.  A
f ter wordW orldW ar I was in Poland,today is in 
the Ukraine
;  
whatever is lef t of that town is in the Ukraine. 
 
 
Roughly, the town had1/3 Jews.  T he town was about 10,000 people.  About 1/3 
were Jews, 1/3 were Pols, and 1/3 were Ukrainian. And the Jewishcommunity, whoever le f t 

bef oreW orldW ar II survived and went toW estern Europe, etc., and whoever did not leave 
perished
, including m y grandparents a
nd m y father's youngest brother.
 
T h i s  i s  t he  c om m u ni ty.   
 
 
Something I discovered very recently.  I have relatives in Israel whowent on a kindof  
pilgrim age af ew years ago.  Oneof  them  sent me abook of herm em ories that she wrote
.  
No
w it's f ashionable now to write your m em ories
.  A
nd at the endof thebook there is a picture 
of  a  l
ittle mem orial monument in m em ory of  the Jews who were m urdered in Dolina.  Ididn't 
know about thatm onum ent. It's in the last pages I saw a picture of that monument.  I just 
discovered that af ew weeks ago.
 
 
My parents, m yf atherfoughtW orldW ar I in the Austrian Arm y.  Then he went to

France, wentback to his little town.  24, hemarried hism other.  Hecam e back to France. My 
sister was born in 26.  T hey still were Pols
.  I
n 28 they all becam e French citizens.  I was born 
in 33, already a French citi
zen.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know anything about your f ather's service besidesbeing part of the 
Austrian Arm y in World W ar I? 
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Idon't know m uch. I know that he was two years in the Russian 
f ront. He was two year s in the Italia
n f ront. W orldW ar I the Italians were with allies
;  
rem em ber that.  He was two years in the Italianf ront. 
 
Hehad a very dangerous task.  He was 
a telephonist. He had to repair telephone line, to spread telephone line underf ire.  He said 
there were many, many casualties.  He, him self, was wounded; notver y seriously. W ell,he 
survi ved.
 
 
One curious thing is my f ather, oneday somebody toldhim , you know, we arrested a 
deserter.  My f ather said, ok.  Put him  inthe little jail.  He goes tothejail.  It
 
was a relative of 
h is
, a
 
young boy.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about yourm other.

besides m y m other
.  
 
 M
y m other was theelder of  thedaughters. The son, thebrother, was theoldest.
 
My m other was trained as a Hebrew teacher. Shedidnot work as aHebrew teacher. She

By the way, I went back to Strasbourg af ew years ago. Thehouse is still there.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he one that you lived in is still there?
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
: T he one we lived. T he house is still there.  I couldbarely, vaguely
 
--
 
not barely, 
vaguely recognize it.  13,[Speaking French]
  
T he house is here.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other, I believe, was diagnosed with cancer
a
t an early age f or you.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Breast cancer. She passed away in 41. By that time I was maybe 7, 
7 1/2, som ething like that.
 
>> Bill Benson: W emay talk a littlebit moreabout that in afew m inutes.
  
W orld W ar II began 
with Nazi Germ any's invasion of  Poland on Septem ber
 
1, 1939.  T wo days later on 
September
 
3, France and Britain declared war on Germany
,  
but f or France the full im pact of 
the war really wasn'tf elt until May
 
1940 whenGerm any attacked France.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  April, May.  T hey surprised the French.  Prepared, of course, the last 
war.  T hey prepared the defense, the line of def ense,
 
which ranalong the Germ an border
.  
T
he Germ ans trickedthem.  They went through Holland andBelgium . They just bypassed and 
invaded France
.  
I think in am atter of
 
six wee ks it was the endof  it
. 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou m entioned that between that period when war began on 
September
 
1939 andwhen Germ any actually attacked France, people ref erred to that period 
as the phony war. W hat did thatm ean? 
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
: T hefunny.  Funny war.  [Speaking French]
 
Because there was no 
f igh t in g
.  E
v
erybody was waiting.
 
 
I know that m yf atherwas
 
--
 
I didn't mentionthat.  My f ather was mobilized in the

French Arm y, butbecause of ageandhaving two children he justpassed the lim it of  
m obilization. He was demobilized.  He came back.W hen he went to
 
I s s ou d un
,  
he came 
b a ck.  

>> Bill Benson:  You were living in an apartmentat the tim e in Paris and yourfather had 
prepaid re
n
tfor several years.  Do you know wh y he did that?
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Not exactly prepaid.  W hen we lef t Paris, that was
 
--
 
how do youcall 
it?  Ahousing project.It belongedthen to theT own Hall of Paris.  My f ather went on paying 
the rent until 1943 when the apartm ent was
 
--
 
they put a seal on it. They took away all the 
furniture, whatever wa s in was taken away.  Som y father stoppedpaying.  But until I think 

August
 
43, something like that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So hehad paidthat rent. But in 1940 you left Paris andf led south. Tell us 

where you went once you left Paris.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  My fa th e r 
w
as a traveling
 
salesm an. He had two or three 
m anuf acturers which he represented ina sm all town called Issoudun.  Issoudun was in the 
f ree zone
 
--
 
you'll rem em berthe map, in the south
,  
in thef ree zone. So that was thef irst place 
we went.  And then later on we went 
t o  V illef ran c he
-
de
-
Rouergue wherem y m other's uncle 
was theref ordecades, hasbeen there. Andwe went to that town.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Can you tell us anything about your time in Issoudun before you went to 

Villef ranche?  Do youknow anything about that?
 
>

Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Idon't rem em ber much to tell you thetruth. W hatI rem em ber isthat 
we went to school with m y cousin, with another cousin, a wom an, Helen. And we

went to the same school. Of course,everybody was telling all thebad things 
thatothers were telling, were doing at school. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Being kids.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedf ree France. For our audience,explain,for those who m ight 
not know, what Vichy France m ea
nt
;  
which is, of  course, where you went when you lef tParis 
af ter the Germans attacked.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
: 
 
W hat we called thef ree France 
--
 
actually i t's incorrect to sayf ree 
France. It's non
-
occupied
,  
notoccupied France. The Germ an occupiedabout 2/3of  the 
territory.  You see the m ap. T here was a bigline going like this because the Germ ans 
occupied everything as south aspossible along the coast. They wanted the whole coast.  But 
beside that, what was on theeastand on thesouth of that li
ne
, 
was under the governm entof  
Vichy.  Now, Vichy collaborated with the Germ ans, obvious
ly
 
collaborated with the Germans. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Butmany French,of  course,f led to Vichy, France, to be away f rom direct 
Germ an occupation.
 
 
S o  afte r yo u  left Iss
oudun,af ter several m onths, your parents, as you said,decided to 
go further south to Villef ranche, to the town of Villef ranche, where you would stay until theend 
of  the war.  Tell us why they chose Villef ranche and then tell us what lif e was like there for you.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
: W e chose Villef ranche becausem y m other's uncle
 
--
 
but there was 
notm uch difference between the generations.  He was af ew years older.  He was theref or 
years became bef oreW orldW ar I in France, as a young m an
 
--
 
a young boy, 15 or something.

He arrived in Paris.  He didn't know French. He didn't have a penny.  He heard som e people 
speaking Yiddish on the platform.  Hetoldthem  thathe wouldhelpthem to carry their luggage 
if  they would pay him  som ething. So they paid him. T hey later adoptedhim , but the war, 
W orldW ar I, then started andhefoundhim self an Austrian national in enemy territory so there 
was no wa y he could have gone back toAustria then.
  
So the French authorities assigned him  
t o  live  n e a r V illef ra
n c he
-
de
-
Rouergue.  And this is where he learned alsothe butch
e ry
.  
>> Bill Benson:  He becam e pretty wel l

known.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  As abutcher andfur
 
--
 
he had afur business.  He went to 
Villef ranche nearby.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ere there any other
 
relatives in Villef ranche whenyou went there?
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Asf ar as I know, no. W hen I say Max, it was Max andfam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Max and hisfam ily.  Right.
 
 
So when you got to Villefranche, you were able to live relatively openly w
hile you 
were there. W hat was your lif e like in the beginning in Villef ranche? 
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  One thing I have tosay before that. W hen we cam e to Villef ranche, 
m y Uncle Max had already lost a son inW orldW ar II. T hat son,Armand, was killed fighting 

the Germans somewhere in May or June
 
1940.  He was a young officer in the French Arm y
.  
H
e was killed f ighting the Germ ans. That was before we arrived. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you got there.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Asf ar as I rem em ber, we hadam oreor less norm al lif e.  Now, 
rem em ber, he was a kid then. Many things maybe they didn't tellm e.

>> Bill Benson:  So itfelt norm al to you.

Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo
:  Itf eltnorm al tom e. I went to school every day.  But I rem em ber that 
once we spentaf ew nights, our science teacher,m y sister andm espent afew nights atm y 
science teacher
™s
. W hat was the imm ediate reason Idon't remember.  I don't know.  But I 
rem em ber that very vi vidly.  T hey had cartoon books, which I rem ember, andall of  th
a t.  Afe w 

nights.
 
 
Now, during the summer we used to go to a sm all Ham let, som e three,fourmiles 
south of Villef ranche. If we went there only f or vacation or if  we went there for other goals, I 
don't know.  Nobody told m e that. I was happy enough to go
 
there
;  to
 
eat good f arm er's f ood 
andto goattendto the ducksand tothe sheep.  But whether therewas another reason Idon't 

know.  T hey didn'ttell me.
 
 
W e ha d a  f e w
 
--
 
the town where we were wer e not hostile. They knew that we were 
Jewish.  T here was
 
in the town som e 20 to30 Jewish f am ilies.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And everybody knew you we re Jewish.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Everybody knew.  The police was even kind enough to letus know 
oneor two days in advance
, 
tom y parents' generation
,  
just go intohidingf or a couple of days 
because we have instructionsto run you up. 
 
 
One caseapplied.  I have to make researchhere at the HolocaustMuseum .  In an 
apartm ent just across the street there was aPolish
-
Jewish f am ily, Stucky.  I remember their 
name.  The
 
f i r s t  n am e of one  
of  
them  now a few weeks ago.

Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Just got that.  Herbert.  They had threeboys.  T hey were ver y poor.  
Andone day they vani shed. W e guesstheywere arrested and shipped somewhere.  
T he  
irony is that thefather was to have said that at leastm y children will have something to eat.  
So today we know that it was not exactly that.  But the meaning so strong was the deception at 
thattim e. T hey were the only ones. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy d
o you 
think they went? 
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
:  Ithinkthey were Pols.  W eare French. And maybe the police had 
obligation to roundthe Pols or som ething.  And alsobecauseat thever y beginning they didn't 

know where they were going
;  
that could be als
o
. 
 
Ihave to make research now.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this is thefam ily that your father, as I recall, helped them out.
 
>> 
Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo
: T hey were poor.  My father used to raisem oney am ong the other 
Jewish f am ilies to help them .

You lost your m other in May
 
1941 when you were 8. W ould youm ind telling

m y m other used to wake herupat nighttoask for help when she was in pain.  Andone night 
she didn't call. W hen m y tante woke up, m ym other was gone.  
 
 
I remember these days quite vi vidl y.

to

few hours later.  I rem em berI saw the casket.  The casket was taken to the train. The train

Denmark when I was
 
a student.  Im ust have been 23, 24, something like that. I went through 
Germ any to Denm arkhitchhiking.  So Itraveledf irst to Ham burg.  Ham burg, I want to takethe 
train to Copenhagen. I was in the train station, had nothing to do.  And here inf ront
 
of  m e wa s  
drinking a beer, was a Germ an guy.  He drank his beer, askedm e where I'm f rom. I said I'm  

f rom  France. He saidhe
 
had goodm em ories of  being a POW in France,especially the good 
wines and goodf ood
.  H

ﬁY
ou know wh at? I'll take you
. ﬂ 
 H

if  you know, in Ham burg, it's a closed area with all the 
prostitutes. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
Ok?  Hetook me there just asa curiosity

I guess it's also atouristtrap.

So he took m e there
. He broughtm e back.  T hen I took the train. T hen I 
we n t to
 
Denmark.

went to Denmark.  
 
 
And then on the way back I hitchhiked again. I cam eto 
La nd k

or 5:00
 
in  
them orning.  I hada backpack.  I was in thestreets. And two young policem

doing there
.
  
They were just doing their job. I have zero com plaint. But I saw the hat 
andI saw the color of the hat.T he color
 
--
 
it's green

gray.  It's the sam e color of copper when 
the copper is rusted. It gave m e goose
bum ps.
 
 
I don't know if  Ianswered the question,but, yeah.

of  young Germ an students.  They cam e.T hey were ver y respectful.  They listened exactly to 
what I said
.  A
s always  a guide should be, very neutral not give his im pression. At some point 
they played the Germ an anthem . I said,"
T
oday you sing the third part."  In Nazi ti
m e t he y 
sang
 
thef irst part. T he music by J

n.  At som epoint they correctedm e.  It was a 
picture of a young girl.  AndI saw

I have very strong ties.  I lookat the 
Middle East, 150,000 people killed inSyria, Lebanon in turm oil. Egypt,
 
Idon't know what will 
happenthere.  Allhope f or thebest.  Israel is only haven of peaceand we are vilif ied
.  W

Israel is. W eare vilified in the world.  
 
 
150,000 people killed in Syria but when Israel builds40,50apartm ents ineastern 
Jerusalem
, it'sa crim eagainst humanity
.  W
e are accused of  using 
di s p

when we react.  If  youare in war, there is nosuch thing as disproportionate.  D

Day, some 
150,000

115,000 went to Normandy.  Ithink they had inf rontof  them m aybe5,000

W ould you call it disproportionate? 
 
This is war. W e are at war.  You use whatever force you 
have to.T hat's all.  T here is no disproportionate.
 
The propaganda is
 
--
 
vi lif ie s  u s .  
 
 
Disproportionate. W hat does itm ean? 
 
You can kill som ebody with a stone.  Israelis 
were killed with stones.  W hen you throw a big stoneona car andthe car breaks
,  
the 
windshield
,  
and the car turns andfalls from  acliff and the people inside can be killed. Justthe 
s a m e.
  
 
 
Many of the so

o staged.  But once the harm is done, theharm  
is done.  You cantry to explain this andthat. It goes on af lash, on the f lash news.  Andto 
correct it two weeks later, too late.
 
 
Anyway. W e'll survi ve.  No problem
.  N

about that. W e will sur vi ve.
