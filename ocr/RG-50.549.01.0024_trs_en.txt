Q: Let's begin if  you wo
uld with your libera
t i on fr om t he cam p s.
 
A: If we, if we
 st art with the liberation was, 
I was liberated on
 August, on April, 
pardon me, on Apr
il 30th, 1945, in Da
chau, actually in 
the side camp of  
________________.  An
d because the side camp where 
most of the Jews  were. 
Dac h au had at t hat t i me, most ly  Chr i st ia
ns,  polit ic a l pr is oners.  And t h e J ewis h  
pris oners, who had co
me from all part of, of Europe
, mostly eastern Europe, they 
were sent into th
e side camps and we
 were in the area
 of Landsberg and 
Kahlfring(ph) etcetera
, in ______________ 
we were building underground 
munitions f act or ies f or  the G erm ans and fo
r the V2, they were
 being built righ t  
outside, in those areas 
and there were _____________ sa
tellite camps, I don't 
know how many, but quit e a f e
w,  I was in one of them.  
We c am e t here fr om, f rom  
Warsaw.  I was in 
Warsaw and yes, __
__________ the uprising
, from Birkenau, 
War saw, Dac h au.   And on Apr i l 30th, we 
were in, well on Apr
il 24th, or 20, 20, 
som e wheres the week  bef or e, 10 days bef o
re, we were in one 
of t hos e s at e llit e 
cam p s and we wer e marc
hed out.  An d, I don't know if 
it's in the pr ev ious t ape, we  
were marched out and we marc
hed for several days and we we
re told at that point, 
aft er we were half way t hrough
, one night t h er e' d be, t he 
Germ ans told us this, ha d 
instr u ct ions  that t h e war is ov er and 
he hav e to t a ke all 
thes e pr iso n er s to 
Switzerland and the Re
d Cross has taken over  and Red Cr oss was 
taking us all t o  
Switzerland.  In retr
ospect, was a lie, that
 was only to keep us
 calm ed down and to 
make us subdued and they 
could handle us, so, but th
ey marched us two more 
days and we were ba
ck, we were behind the wire in
 Da chau.  So 
that was the 
eas i est  way  to k e ep us toget he
r, not to have us
 escape.  Anyhow 
t he, the Am er ica n  
army liberated us early in 
t h e morning and t h is m or n ing,
 interestingly enough, I got 
a picture from a ma
n whom I met a year ago.
  His, he lives in 
Mill Valley, across the 
Golden Gate br idge.  He was 
one of t h e s o ldier s t h at lib
erated the camp that I was 
liber at ed, t hat mor n ing and by
 pure accident, th
e reason we found 
eac h ot her ,  we 
gav e, we honor e d liberat ors  last year as
 a Yah Meshua(ph), 50
th anniversary and 
we, our staff had a Jewish
, a ______________ , send off ads and le
tters and they 
found 120 liber at or s in t h is
 area, up and down the co
ast, almost close to Los 
Angeles and int o Or egon.  One of  thes e m
en, during the dinner, that night we gav e  
a dinner for, I was the chairman of it a
nd dur i ng t h e dinner, he
 said to me, he saw 
the pic t ur e,  that f am ous pic t ur e being, wh
ic
h wa s being used in, for all these years 
at, at the m us e um, our  mus e um, he s ay s, " T ha
t is not Dac h au. "  It ' s a pict ur e that 
you have seen on the,
 ______________ 
Dachau liberation.
  It really was 

Allac h( ph).   He s a id,  "T hat ' s Allac h. "  
I said, "How do you know?"  He said,  
"Because I know it as Alla ch."
  So he twist it back and 
by God we met again, surely  
I said and he, he s
howed me, "It is Alla
ch(ph), I can tell you."   And it was 
Allach(ph).  So I have the pi
ctur e here, so I ' m in the pi
ctur e.  And since t h en he ,  
well he's very active in the 42nd division, 
the Rainbow division, whic h is the divisio n  
we wer e liber ated, who liber at ed Dac h au and
 our c am p and this 
m or n ing, I lunc hed 
with about two weeks ago, thre

g he sent me
 a picture, 
whic h I want to giv e t o  the,
 t o t he mus e um in Was h ington
, I don't know if they hav e  
this, it's a picture of
 the American soldiers
 killing quite a few of 
the Germans.  The y  
lined them up, they 
lined them up on the wall 
and they k i lled them, until an 
Am eric an general came ther
e and saw this happening and 
he we nt almost berserk, 
this general, I'm going to me
et with him in a very, ve
ry, in the next couple of 
months, he' s st ill aliv e.  He
 was s o  ups et t hat they did 
this, he kicked, the machin e 
gun, he kic ked t h e s o ldier  and stopped t h em us ing t he 
machine gun.  
And they had 
killed about 17 of the guar

me that 
again t h is mor n ing wit h t h e pic t ur es.   And I  
didn't, I realized that
 I saw that happen, 
but that c a me back only t o da
y to me.  Anyhow, 
we were liberated 
and with my luck, 
a Dutch Red Cr oss came im
mediately., for some reas
on there was a connection 
about, ther e wer e s ev er al hundr e d Dut ch Ch

whoever , if  they  got  y o u, if  
you're not with them

.  And this  appear 
from the Dutch underground

Dutch Red Cr oss came 
immediately, within 10 da

Bernardi(ph), then husband 
of the then Pr incess, who's 
now,  who's now the Q u een

with t h em.  And t hey 
picked us up and 
they dr ov e us  all the way  fr
om Dachau back to
 Holland on those 
trucks, took about 
six, five, six days, the 
bridges were out, you know
 and _______________
_ stuff.  I 
remember we stopped in 
Frankfurt for some reas
on and __________
______, Iggy 
Farben(ph) fact ory, which wa s a big cafeteria 
________________ 
and they kept us 
there for one or  t wo night s
, one night and we we nt ba
ck to Holland
 and at th e 
border, we,  we wer e ask ed wher e we wer e
 fr om and I was not 
a Dutc h citiz en, I  
had no documentat
ion, all I could say, I was 
from _______________
____.  But I'd 
only, I
' d only liv e d t h er e s inc e I was  10 y e
ar s old,  we c am e t h ere 19 36, we went  
ov er t h e bor der  from  Germ any into Holl
and, only about 25 m
iles.  Wasn't far 
enough obviously because they
 killed all my family.  A
nd the Red Cross took me 
back to Holland, to, to
,  to Ber culo( ph) fr om t h e, fr om
 t h e,  that, t h er e was a t o wn on 
the bor der,  Sav i na( ph) , wher e t hey, it was  
k i nd of an ar my, army  t o wn and t h at' s  
wher e t h ey  held t h em for a 
day or two and, and as s i gn
ed us wher e we want ed t o  
go.  And we were, I was in a,
 in a, in a pair of black 
pant s, which were s om e pa nt s  
I'd tak en off  a s o ldier, an 
SS I' d k illed and a t oothbr us h 
f r om t h e s a me SS m a n I 'd 
killed.  And the, and the shir
ts.  We had no cl
othes except the striped things, whic h 

we couldn't get out fast enoug
h and they were very
 filthy.  So I was 
in some beat up 
Germ an' s uniform.  And then they  gave us 
ot her c lot hes at the bor d er and as muc h  
______________, that's 
because Holland wa
s in very bad sh
ape in  1945, the 
Germans had plundered it.  An
d they took me ba
ck to my, what  I call my hometown 
and they took me to the city hall, there 
wa s no place for me to
 go.  The house was 
occupied that we lived in, it
 was occupied by people, I h
ad no idea who they were. 
And.. .
 
Q: You remembered the town, wa
s it still familiar to you?
 
A: Oh sure, oh I we nt to school
 there, oh sure, went to 
school there, I mean like my 
fat her had a busines s  ther e, 
m y fat her had a text ile st or
e ther e.  And t h er e wer e,  
there had been 42 
Jewish families 
and it was known in 
Holland as the most 
religious Jewish town.  Re
ligious meaning what we ca
ll Conservative here. 
Ev erybody _____________ on Sh abbat, everybody 
eat kosher, nobo
dy smoked o n  
Shabbat and nobody drove 
his bicycle or car on Shabbat. 
 Very traditional, went to 
Temple three times a day 
on Shabbat and during the we
ek twic e a day.  And 
everybody had their diff
erent busin esses, 
from cattle  dealers to bu
tchers to textile t o  
scrap, you know, typical Jewish trades. 
 And we had a, a rabbi and we had a 
mikba( ph) of cour se.    And 
t her e was a wonderfu
l Jewish life there 
befor e t h e war,  
literary things, my father was quite active
 in the communi
ty and so was my mother 
and they, but there 
was no one left when 
I came there, exce
pt the mayor says 
yeah, there's somebody
 came back 
that was hidden 
and was a man by
 the name of 
May er( ph) and his childr en wer e
 all, all killed, so was hi
s wif e, he s urv
ived and was 
hidden in  some farmhou
se.  And another coup
le survived, there we
re no children. 
And then, they didn't
, they couldn't handle 
m e bec a us e they had no plac e t o liv e  
themselv es, they lived somewheres in, 
I forgot where they  _____________
, weren't 
back in t heir hom es y e t.  And 
our neighbor, Cat holic, was  
a Catholic town, to some 
extent, maybe 50-50 
and our neighbor 
c am e ov er,  they hear
d about this, a small 
town , there was 7,000 people and
 they said, "He's staying wi
th us," so I lived with 
our neighbors.  They _____
___________ , they had
 a room in t
he back, near the 
stables, ________________ people ha
ve the cows in the, in
 the winter they stayed, 
not in the house, but 
in the back of the hou
se there's stab
les.  So I slept there and 
they m a de a bed f or me and 
I stayed with my neighbors, 
I couldn't, I wouldn't eat 
pork things, so I usua
lly pot atoes and br eads  and sala
ds , but I c ouldn't , I did not  eat  
the, t he pork product s .   Whic
h, t hat was t h e only t h ing 
they had in me
at in thos e 
days, because they had their own, they ra
ise their own pigs.  And I stayed with 
them f or, and t he may or of t h e t o wn k new 
my parents quite we ll
, gave me 
a j ob in 
the city hall, to work some clerk, was 
awful, pencil pushing,
 y ou k now, what ev er  
that's called and but I had 
a job because I had no money.
 
Q: How old were yo
u at this point?
 

A: I was 18.  In April I was, 
in April '45, I was not 19 ye
t, I was 18.  And it was ver y  
strange because number one, 
there was no one left, a few 
here stray people, Jews, 
were hidden.  No one came 
back from the camps, I wa
s the only one there who 
had c om e back fr om t he cam p
s.  And ther e were Jews 
in those towns in Holland, 
ev er y town had J e ws and, and  they had wonderf u l lives t h
ere.  We, we
 never knew 
about anti-Semit ism.  We k
new it  from Germany, my fa
mily and I did,
 but native 
Dutch Jews did not know about 
anti-Semitism, it didn't ex
ist, as far as I remember. 
And s i nc e I was, I  was not  a Dutch c it i z
en because we were st
ateless, til Hitler 
made the Nuremberg laws, said
 we ar e stat eless,  I nev e
r became a Dutch citizen, 
________________ firs
t I was citizen was 
when I came to this
 country, became 
Am eric an in 1954.  An
yhow, so I stayed with the nei
ghbors, then a
bout a month or 
two and I found my un
c l es.   M y mot her  had two br
others who were in the camps 
and I f ound them in a c am p in Holland
, in Westerbork.  
And I went there...
 
Q: How did you go 
about finding them?
 
A: By wor d of m out h.
 
Q: Was that common, was th
at going on ar ound y ou?
 
A: Yeah, t h er e wer e, y ou k n
ow, people made phone calls,
 people knew my uncles 
for some reason.  I knew that
 they were in West
erbork when I went
 to Auschwitz.  
They stayed there.  But 
I didn't know it
 because the ______
__________ that my 
parent s were t h er e, t w o of my
 sist ers,  t hey went t o Au
schwitz, my uncles allegedly 
stayed with _____________
___ , I didn't know that, bu
t they did stay and they, I 
don't know how I found them
, I don't know how 
they found me, bu
t we found eac h  
ot her.   I f or got who t o ld us how it  was do
ne.   And then, but th
ey couldn't come to 
the ________________   
to Berculo(ph), ____________
___, there wa s no place I 
could, I could put them.  So finally  they ca
me anyhow.  But before
 that, let me ste p  
back  a bit.  Aft er m a ybe a m o nt
h or t w o, aft e r I cam e  back,  I'm  c a lled t o t h is, t o  the 
mayor's office, in the town and he says, "Y
ou k now, your gr andm other' s here. "  My  
mot her ' s mot her, who had liv e d wit h us, c
ause she also came ov
er the border f rom  
Germ any, she was  a widow, and s h e had 
liv e d wit h us  for,  f r om 30, fr om  
Kr istallnacht on.  Was also shipped to, 
to Westerbork and 
wound up too, in  
Ther es ienst adt.  And s he s ur v iv ed.  So t hey
 brought her back an
d they put her in a 
Red Cr os s van and t h ey,  s h e r e mem ber ed Be
rculo(ph), the name
, so that the Red 
Cr oss, I don't know how she, ________
________  she got in
.  ________________ 
I thin k it was about the sa
me _______________, I ca
me in from over
 the border. 
They flew her back by
 plane and she's sitting in the 
middle of town and the t o wn' s  
all have a square, you 
know, wit h a c h ur ch in the m i dd
le.  T h er e is t h is Red Cr os s  
van with my gr andmother in it.
 
Q: Alone?  Wer e t here ot her s wit h her?
 

A: No, just herself, no one
 else.  And said, 
"You have to take
 your grandmother 
________________ ."
  So I had no place to
 put her.  So
 was this one Jewish family 
who were colleagues of my
 parents, c om petitor s r
eally but, you know, sam e  
bus i ness.  And we weren't 
c l ose t o them , but we k new
 each other quite we ll 
bec aus e the T em p le and t h e Shul.  He, t h ey
 said, br ing her in.  T h ey had gott en  
their house back. So they 
took her in, just took he
r in ______________
_.  They 
als o took in the t hree c h ildr en of t he r a bb
i, who wer e found by 
Christian, they were  
hidden by, in, by Ch rist
ian families, they took
 the three, three ch
ildren in, they were 
found.  The parents we
re killed, the rabbi 
and his wife were k
illed, but they found 
the three children, how, I can,
 I cannot tell you how they
 found them.  They were 
hidden in farmhouses, so
me as far away as 50
 mile s.  So they 
all of a sudden had 
a big f am i ly  and s o  my  gr andmot her st ay ed 
t here.   And then my
 uncle's got out of 
the c am p and t h ey  had no 
plac e t o liv e , so they went , c am e t o t o wn,  they  
________________ .  Th
e only place whic h had al
most a ________
_______.  So 
my two uncles, they were st
ill single in those 
days, and they were
 born, they were 
at that point in their 40's al
r e ady, bec a us e t he war, in ' 3 8,
 it cam e ov er th e bor d er  in 
'38 fr om G erm any and they wer e s i ngle
.  They wer e  bor n 
in 1901 and 1902, 
somewhere in those years, 
they were two year
s apart.  And we 
put t h em in th e 
mikba(ph), that's wh ere they
 lived.  No money, nothin g, 
nothing, nothing, nothing. 
And they had been quit e well  
off in Germany, they were
 people of great means, my 
mot her ' s s i de.  And s o  I was wor k ing and m y
 unc l es wer e c att le 
dealers and I think I 
should have it in  the story th
at gives you an, I think I take
 great credit fo
r that.  The 
farmers, one day I got a ca
ll, I mean not by 
phone, but they fo
und me and about 
four farmers came, they said
, "Look, we, your father al
ways sold us text iles.  W e  
liked your par ent s ver y  much,  they wer e so
 good to us. 
 Needed credit, got credit, 
we didn't have money.
.."  That 's how my, my mot her 
was always active 
in this kind 
of work.  "And we have
 decided that we took a 
piece of land, ________________ 
and we bought 12 cows in 
the pas t ur e and here they ar e 
for your uncles.  Now, my 
unc l es had nev er liv ed ther e, t h ey had ne
ver lived there, they
 knew my mother. 
And they said, "Here 
t hey  ar e,  y o u go an
d trade with them and when you make 
money, you pay us  bac k
."   W e ll m y unc l es  took that
 of cour se, it was very, very 
emotional.  They did 
and they became extremely su
ccessful cattle 
dealers, to a 
point
 that ther e was anot her
 t wo men, t w o J e wis h m e n 
who also had surviv ed, who 
were friend, old friends of theirs and th e four of them, they
 were the largest 
exporters of cattle to Isr
ael.  They had boatloads go
ing out  of  Rott erdam ever y  
thr ee m ont hs.   And t h ey  devel
oped in Israel, the dairy indu
stry.  They, they supplied 
the Israeli's with th
e dair y c o ws, whic h c am e f r om 
Holland, y o u k now t he blac k  and 
whites?  The Holsteins?  And 
t h ey wer e experts, m y unc l
es and their two friends.  
So my unc l es bec am e quit e succ e
ssful again, in 
their businesses.

A: O k ay, let me t e ll y o u abou
t the liberation.  When, we 
were liberated 
early in the 
mor n ing, s a w the tanks  com i ng ov er the, ov er
 the hill.  And we had to scream to the  
soldier, t he Am er ic an s o ldier bec a us e t h e wi
r es wer e all high t e ns ion wir e and they  
had to bring in  the engineers fi
rst.  The next day or so, or
 maybe a day, within this, 
there we re about half  a dozen 
of us, we could still walk, 
we  we re in f a ir ly go o d  
shape.   W e m ov e d out of t h e c am p im
m ediat ely and moved int o one of t h e SS 
barracks.  Why, I don't know and I was 
the youngest of the whole gang, there wa s 
one other kid from Paris 
was younger.  And, and we
 decided we, because the 
Am eric ans immediately closed 
the camp, it was full of 
Typhoid, there was Typhoid 
and you nam e it , all 
the diseases, so we didn't wa nt
 to be behind the    wires 
because it took, they couldn
't get out any 
more.  They were, th
ey were liberate d 
and t h ey wer e st ill bac k, they
 went back in the concentrat
ion camp.  The first troops 
were very good, but 
the second troops th
ey, very protective 
of the surroundin g  
Germans, for wh atev
er reason.  ___________
____.  And we wen
t, I remember, the 
only time I went  to, to town of Dachau, we
 went in t h e t o wn an
d we took a pushcart 
and we c l eaned out  on
e hous e wit h c l ot hes and wit h 
food.  And what I remember...
 
Q: How did you go about do
ing that, where were t
he people that lived there?
 
A: There we re people, we just pi
c k ed a house, I r em em ber, it  was 
________________  h
ouse and we went in and took
 as much clothes as we 
needed and, four of us, beca
use we had found next to 
us in the camp, another 
small camp with about 40 so
me odd women, young girls,
 Jewish women, who were 
from Lithuania and from 
Czechoslovakia  and Hungary
.  All eastern, eastern 
Europeans.  And we b
ought things back for 
them, they were in 
terrible, terrible 
shape, those girls.  And 
we took _____________
___ , one of the 
Germans in the 
house ________________ 
 trie d to get fancy wi
th us.  Well, we didn't kill him, but 

we put him in a corner
, we took care of hi
m that he didn't, he co
uldn't fight us any 
longer.
 
Q: What do you m e an?
 
A: Well we , we beat him up.  Because 
he was, he called us
, he was nasty, he 
wasn't, we did what we
 s h ouldn't  hav e done, but we di
d it bec a us e at t h at t i me it  
was allowable.  In my opinion 
it still it.  They, bu
t I've told this ma
ny times, I'm very 
pr oud of  one t h ing.  That  in
 as much as the 
Jews were liberated
, us, be it anger 
beyond any measure, 
we had seen k
illings hourly, not daily
, hourly, morning til 
night, over a period 
of years.  I don't k
now one Jew, one Jew 
who killed a German. 
I'm not talking about sold
iers, SS, but not a Germ
an civilian, wh ich no one 
appr eciat es ,  the G erm ans nev er appr eciat ed 
that.  But the Jews 
that were left out 
of the camp and I've
 checked this with 
other friends, so-ca lled colleagues, that 
when they came ou
t of the camps they did not kill Ge
rman civilians.  That gives me 
the pr ide as a J e w and as a hu
man being, of that 
we were still
 civilized after having 
lived in the mud and the mu
rders and the gas chambers, 
etcetera, our Jews were 
still, still civilized. 
 And that gives me, and that alwa
ys will give me 
great deal of 
pr ide.  
 
Q: Why do you t h ink you yourself were  able t o hold on to that dignity ?
 
A: We weren't brought up 
like, lo ok, the people 
I know ________________  my 
families and the to
wn I lived in and othe
r towns I used to visi
t, we were brought up 
in a, in a, in a civilizati on which we didn't, we had neve
r seen this kind of thin g 
________________ , 
no one had.  But t
he Germans and Goldha
rgen(ph) says it 
very clea rly in his b
ook, in as much they didn't, they
 weren't r ac i st mur der er s, but 
they let it happen.  So, 
and it was consent, the cons
ent of the Germans, th e 
consent of the Du
tch, the consent of al
l the Europeans, 
the entire Chri
stian world. 
And I will maintain, as lo
ng as I live and I said
 it in my own, my 
own book too, that 
when history will be wr
itten, I hope that so
me of these stories, 
writers will 
say, that 
during a Christian 
era, six million Jews were
 killed.  It wasn
't a Arab era,
 it wasn't a 
Chinese era, it wasn't a Buddhist era, it 
was an era in time, in
 Eu rope wh ich was a 
Christian world, Catholics 
and Protestants and 
that's when they killed six million 
Jews.  They can't hide, they can't wa lk away from tha
t.  It wasn't done by people 
who wer en' t religious.  The maj or ity of th
e people, I would say the majority were 
church going people.  I know
 in my town they
 were.  I we nt to Catholic school.
 
Q: Do y o u, hav e y o u over t h e y
ears developed a thought of why?
 
A: W h y?   Why ?  Be c au s e 
there was deep down 
anti-Semit ism.  I mean go, you go 
back  in his t ory,  the J e ws  
in Europe, they were only permitted to come to towns, 
they we re invited, if
 they we re invited.

communities there, befo

 gray stone, whic h 
we can go in later, 
gray stone rubbing in  
the town  I was born, 
going back to 1530, 
of my families names.  So 
I lived there longer than some
 of the other
, non-Jews. 
Some have lived ther e too t hat
 long, but, but why did the Ch

A: Well, we weren't sl

 The feeling, how did you feel?  Well, I said 
earlier, when we were told
 that t h e G erm ans  told us 
on a m arc h fr om the out ly ing

de 1 of tape 1]
 
Q: So let's go back and ta
lk about  that phot o gr aph.
 
A: Well all  I know, that the, that the 
American army came in 
and we  were standing 
on a br idge, on a tower, on
 t h e st airs of  the watc
h tower and I remember, I 
rem ember ed all t hes e year s that
 t hey t ook a pict ur e.  And I also r e mem ber t h at th e 
Am er ic an army put me in a room, I'm sure 
they  did it  wit h ot
her s als o and I was 
interviewed and I remember 
a s o ldier  s itt ing t here and 
typing, typing for hours and 
hour s to int erv iew m e.   And I 
can't find, I would 
love to find that interview.  Some 
person took, archiv es of t
he Un ited St ates Army, wher
e I don't know.  I have to 
mak e t im e one of thes e day s to f i nd it.  I don' t
 know how to find it. 
 I know it's there, 
I don't know what divisi
on it would be in.  Coul
d be a 42nd, I doubt it.
 
Q: Try and remember some of th
e questions he was asking you?
 

A:  I have no idea, probably 
the same like you're as king
 me, how did you feel and 
what happened and I would lik
e to hear myself or read 
what I said 
then, becaus e 
we wer e num b, bec a us e t he night of t h e li
beration, went throu
gh a bombardment. 
The G erm ans had t a ken the an
ti-air craft batteries and bom
barded the camp.  They 
killed hundreds of them 
that night.  29th or 
the night of the, the 
night of the, no, th e 
29th r at her .  And they took t he aircr aft 
batt er ies, t he guns, instead of s h ootin g  
where they shot those airp
lanes, they shot them stra
ight out.  ________________ 
and they killed quite a few 
of our people.  Because t
here were probably 30,00 0  
people there, a lot.  
And so, I don't re
member, I do not remem
ber how I got in to the 
Dutch transfer, because I wa
s the only Jew that I knew
, there may have been 
ot her s, who was  on this  Re
d Cros s tr ansf er bac k t o  
Holland.  I k
now that, I 
remember seeing Pr in ce Bern
ard, that was made a deep im
pression on me.  I don't 
rem ember  who t he people wer e
 I was with, they were all 
Christians and they were 
________________  I ha
d known before, __
______________  
in the camps with.
 
Q: How had they realized th
at y o u wer e fr om
 Holland, how was that communicated 
to...?
 
A: Yo u know there's always 
the word of mouth and then,
 and t h en,  what do the y  
call, t h e, t h e gr apev ine or t h e, I don't  k now
, I found out somewher e that the, the,  the 
Dutch were being picke
d up by the Re d Cr oss and I 
got my s elf on that,  on that 
transport, pure accident I'm sure because I 
don't know, I 
don't know if  there were 
ot her  Dut c h Jews wit h m e or not, I don'
t think so, because I 
would know, I would 
have stayed in  co
ntact with them.  Ther e we
re none that  I remember.
 
Q: Did you, for a moment w
hen you were out of the ca
mp, even though you'd seen 
your parents going to the ga
s chamber, seeing your family
, at all had, were you at  
all seiz ed with this feeling of 
wanting to go se
arch for them?
 
A: Ye s.  Well I knew we had
 agreed to back to
 Ber c ulo( ph), but I went als o wit h in 
months, I went to the town in Germany we 
wer e bor n.    I t  was 
only, I got somebody 
to take me there.
 
Q: How?
 
A:  So mebody had a car, somebo
dy in the, in the town h
ad a car, I don't know how 
he had a car, but 
he had a c ar, it was m ay b e s i x m o nt
hs after liberati
on and he to ok 
me to that town, I think 
I took, went by car, I do
n't remember, 
________________ , 
I don't remember, yet 
I stayed, you know, he didn't have
 a c ar, didn't, t hat was the 
second t im e.  I  went ther e 
and I stayed with our neighb
or s, t her e wa
s one neighbor 
who talked to us, stay
ed, had some 
connection with us, up to
 as lo ng as he could 
and when I  went ther e I k n
ocked at the door and when 
they saw me, I said, they 
as ked me what  are y ou, y o u k now, we t a lk
ed, I said, "I'm look
ing for my parents 

and my  s i ster  and my gr andf at her,  m y
 grandmother."  
And, and, not my 
grandmother, sh
e was, she had come ba
ck to Holland.  My 
grandfather though, 
didn't, my father's fa
ther.  And I think I stayed ov
ernight with them, I vaguely 
remember and ____
___________, but they sa
id, "No, your pare
nts have not been 
here. "  And that was  
the answer.  They said , "There 
ar e no J e ws  left here. "  They 
told  me that.  I we nt to a 
synagogue and it was 
burned down, they 
burned it in '38 
and it was ________________
  there.  Now it 's a park
ing lot, except this woman, 
this  neighbor, she put a little
 st atue t h er e f or the Jews 
and there's flowers there all 
the time, it 's a very religious
 Catholic lady and I corres
pond with her.  She came to 
vis it us her e.  T h at was  about
 1 99 3,  I t h in k ,  it  wa s a vi
sit with her, yeah.  For a 
different reason I was in Ge
rmany with the United St ates
 army.  In Ho
lland, rather, 
Holland, Belgium and France. 
 And I stopped in
 Germany to see 
my grandfather's 
grave and that's when I saw 
her for the first time again.
  I will not go back to 
Germany now, I'll never go ba
ck, they insult ed 
me.  And, and that
's it, as far as 
Germany's concerned, __________
______ went there.  My 
feelings, I don't know, I 
went back to Holland, I lived 
with this neighbors, I went
 dancing ever
y night, I can 
tell y ou t hat .  Holland was c e lebr at ing f o
r a year, t he Dutc h and the, danc es ev er y  
ot her night,  ev er y night .   I went t o ev er y danc e.
 
Q: And did you dance?
 
A: I danced, I danced a lot, I 
j ust didn't want t o  think.
 
Q: Who were y o u danc ing wit h ?
 
A: And girl I could, was willing
 to dance with me, 
short or tall.  No
, I remember that 
dist inct ly because t
here wer e alway s danc es  ther e,
 there wa s, it
's not done any 
more today, but af
ter the war they danced, everybod
y was c e lebr at ing, c e lebrating, 
celebrating,  not dr ink i ng, 
there wasn't, you know it's
 not like we, par ty ing here,  
wher e you hav e to dr ink, t h e Dut ch don't do
 that.  Maybe, ther
e was n 't e v en beer I  
thin k in those days.  And obvi
ous l y I didn't dr ink, t h en.  
And I went danc ing a lot ,  a 
lot, dance, dance,
 not to think.
 
Q: Did it help?
 
A: I don't know, didn't hur
t.  I don't know, it must ha
ve helped because I didn't even 
hav e to f or ce m ys e lf.  That 's all t here wa
s to do and you work
ed and t here was, I 
mean t h ey didn't tak e you, y o u 
didn't hav e to go t o high sc
hool to do what I had to 
do t h ere.  I  was just s i tting there behind
 the counter and handi
ng out the coupons 
for the, for the rationing.  An d I did this 
for about six, eight mont
hs.  Then I decided, 
may b e s i x months, t hen I dec i ded to go bac k
 in business in my father 's business.  
 
Q: Text ile business?
 

A:  Text ile.  I didn't have a 
stor e,  s o I  got  m ys e lf a bi
cycle and two suit cases an d 
through connections
 my father had, that they 
helped, they helped me and I had 
als o a f irst cous in of m y mot h er had s urv
ived.  They helped me
, they gave me, got 
me merchandise, was very, ve
ry hard because you had 
to have con
nections and 
you had to hav e a st or e and I didn't hav e
 anything so I got me
rchandise and then I 
went ever y  mor ning, fiv e day s a week , 
I went by bicyc le fr om  farm hous e t o  
farmhouse, I wa s 19 years old,
 and to sell textiles.  And 
then when I sold out I went 
back t o t he sourc e s and t h ey gave m e m o
re, they were, they
 always helped me, 
people were always ve
ry nice to me.
 
Q: Tell me what was in
 the suit cases on your  bicycle,
 what were you, what did you  
have to sell?
 
A: I sold underwear, I so
ld yardage goods, 
mostly yardage goods
 so they could 
sew their own.  Holland, wo
m a n in Holland are v ery t a lent ed wit h that and s o cks ,  
shirt s, y ar d age and I s o ld 
that.  And stockings and, and
 whatever I made, I could 
buy mor e.  I nev er had a st or e and t h en af
t er about a year, in
 1946, obv i ous ly I  
was n 't mak i ng any m o ney and 
this was no future and I 
couldn't get  the st or e bac k  
bec aus e s om e Naz is  had it.  And the t o wn
 wa s, it was n 't fo r me.  Th er e wa s  
nothing for me to do, I was 
the only Jewish young person th
ere.  And I dec i ded  t ha t  
point that I was going 
to remain a Jew, I di
dn't  think so when 
I was first 
liberated.
 
Q: Just say more about
 that, please?   
 
A: Well I, I, I survived, you 
know, I had my doubt
s,  I had a f i ght  wit h  God,  wit h  
myself and God about if ther
e's a God, how can 
He let that happen
?  And we were 
brought up religious as
 I said earlier and 
I had some, not long, 
it  was a very short 
period after  the war t h at I thought  may b e it
 be better to just 
throw up any sign of 
religion, just live as a human 
being, period.  And that didn'
t, t h at didn't 
sit well with 
me after a few days bec
ause I had too much 
tradition in me, thin
king, then I thought 
about my mot her , she would 
be totally disagreeing with 
that and my gr andm ot her  
and my grandfather, my
 grandparents for that matter, th
ey would disagree with that 
and they wouldn't tolerate that
 if th ey wer e a l iv e.  A n
d I'm thinking of back from 
befor e t he war end.  And I had v e ry good 
educ at ion, I s t udied not only Tanak h,  the 
Bible, but also the Gemara 
and,  and the ot her m a ny  bo
oks, we studied every night 
in Ho lland when we were
 children, ________________ Sa
turday and Sunday, the 
Mishna.  So I had lear ned a 
lot in my short li
fe.  When I was 
14 I could read 
Ros h i( ph) , the c omm ent ator  on t he, on t h
e Torah and the miss
ion, so we were  
highly educated in the Jewish wa
ys.  And that, tha
t, that left somethin
g in my veins, 
in my blood.  So I, I we nt
 back and then my 
uncles and my grandm
other were alive, 
so I t h ink I 'm a Jew, I'm a 
J ew.   That, t hat went by 
t he way s i de real f a st, jus t  
________________ 
of becoming a nobody.
 

Q: When you were in
 t he c am ps, did y ou pr ay 
and did you co
nnect to God?
 
A: Well, yes, I always
 pr ay ed, I hav e a short  pr ay er 
t h at  I s ay  ev en no w, t h e s am e  
pr ay er I said t hen.
 
Q: Will you say it ?
 
A: It's the Shema, with a 
f e w ot her sent enc es, and...
 
Q: Do you, will you add that?
 
A: Huh ?
 
Q: Can you say that for the tape?
 
A: Sur e, I alway s s ay  Shem a, t he whole S
hema, t h e f irs t thr e e, four  sent e nc es and 
then I s ay a s ent enc e  at the end of a pr ayer
, which is usually said in the, in the 
religious community at Temple
s at the end of the service 
and I'll give you the last 
line of it.  And t hat ' s,  that 's  s a d,  my mo
ther taught me that 
when I  was a child.

I trust in God, I have

and at night I, I

I said it a, I said it a lot 
when I was in

I'm not that deeply, I'm relig

  On the other ha

Q: Well, you live 
in San Francisco.
 
A: I live in San Francisco a
nd where I wa s brought up they
 nev er, I never heard of  
it, so that wasn't, they  never could tell me 
I couldn't eat it.  Pork
 they could tell me, 
they t a ught  me plent y,  but 
crab, I never heard

liv e d inland, ther e was no r efr ig

that doesn't 
bother m e for some r eas on.   Anyhow, t h
e Jewishness st uck t o m e, t h ank G od, it  
really stuck  to m e and it didn
't go away.  And I must say 
that there's a 
large majority 
of the sur v ivor s have maintain
ed  their Jewishness.  Th er
e ar e v er y few, ver y  fe w 
that I know, survivors and 
I think some of this, _______
_________  so close to us 
and ________________  came
 out of the camps, but the

has, who really ha
s said, "I'm now a

e, because I 
thought about it 
ver y oft en in t he last, last

let's face it, we k
now when t h ey marc h int o the

Q: Before, I've a few questions right at th
e time when you were
 leaving the camps 
and going back  to Holland, do 
you r ecall m u sic t h at you h

A: Music?  Like what ?
 
Q: I don't know, were
 people in the camps singing, 
were the Am eric
ans singing, 
was t h er e mus i c on a radio?
 
A: There was no, ther
e was no music.  Ther e was no music, ther e was no singing.  

I don't r em e mber, t he liberat ion if
 there was any si

Q: Did you know, did you ha

 what was going 
on with the war?
 
A: W e sm e l le d s om e th in g.  We  sme l le d 
something that there 
was,  we  s a w, t h e  
reason that  we heard it mo

'40, we left, we came 
out of Warsaw in '4
4 and the reason we 
had to leave Warsaw, whic h is in 
the, in  the _______
_________ because the 
Russians poked through.
  And t h ey m ar c hed us  for  t w
o weeks.  An d you know, yo u 
might hav e  hear d that  we ha
d 3600 Jews in Wars aw.  In the ghett o, this was  no t  
the ghetto ________________  the ghetto,
 but when the fighting, so-calle d, 
stopped, the uprising, they took 300 peopl
e from Birkenau to 
Warsaw, to burn 
bodies and to dy nam it e the g
het to.   I was one of those. 
 Unfortunately  the museum 
has n't  m ade an ef fort  and I  
have to do somethin g about it
, that should be
 wr itt en  u p  
mor e, t h at stor y.  Bec aus e we went t o W a
rsaw and built a camp
 within the ghetto. 
And they build it  up, they 
bought us all the Hu
ngar i ans  then,  in ' 4
3, the end of '43 
and in ' 44, June of ' 4 4,  ther e wer e  3600 
people aliv e.  300 coul
dn't work any more, 
they killed them, 300 stayed 
to dynamite the ghetto and 
they killed them and 3,000 
marched out of Warsaw and 
240 got out of the boxcars 
in Dachau.  I'm one of 
those.  The rest were killed 
on the road.  And that's the 
story.  We w
ent through a 
river, t h ey dr owned a lot of
 our people, a lot.  An d se
e, I always had luck, I was 
always in t h e fr ont  c o lumn or t he bac k 
column, never in the

Q: Do you have a theory of why you 
have that luck, 
do you have a...
 

A: Theory?  No, you know, th

self f a br ic at ed t heory .  I  
happen t o believe t h at , as m u ch as G o d di
dn't pay much attent

days , that he want ed that s o
m e of t hem s urv iv e because I  believe t hat God, ther e is

c a us e no one c an tell y ou t
hat they we re smart enough  
to save t hemself  fr om
 the Holoc a ust,  t her e is  no s uc h
 thing.  It was 
pure,  pur e luc k. 
Be in  the right place at the

the wr ong time.  There is no lu ck, th
ere's no ________________ 
, no knowledge, it 
was pur e, pure luc k.  Look, 
I was the first tran
sf err ed out of Holl
and in, in ov er a 
year they kept anyone aliv e.
  There were 3,000
 people on the trains
 and they kept a 
couple hundred aliv e, I wa s one of 
those.  The rest were all gassed 
________________ within 
hours after they got 
to Birkenau.  First 
transport in over 
a y e ar.  Pur e luck , r ight ? 
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So who can s a y?  Pure lu

But it was lu ck to meet

Q: I want to, before 
we go beyond the ca
mps also, would you te
ll me about killin g  
the SS off i c er ?
 
A: Oh yes, kill him, we kill
 him wit h some ston
es or som e two by fours, som et h in g .  
You k now, we wer e angry at t h at point a
nd we we re hungry, we hadn't had food in 
days, four or five days we
 hadn't had food and they 
were bombin g 
all night and 
there were people laying all over
.  Hundreds died 
the last night of the...  They kne w  
they 'r e liberat ed but t hey died wit h in hour
s or dur i ng t he liber at ion at night, they  
were bombing and we  didn'
t k now whet her the Amer ic
ans were bom bing or the 
Germ ans were bom b ing.   W e heard t h e, 
t he, the, t h e, t he, the bomber s going 
overhead, bombing Germ
an in stallations.  But they
 didn't, but the Am eric ans and 
the Br it ish did not bomb the camps. 
 They could have 
________________ the 
trains to Auschwitz, you know they talk 
about the famous, all 
those lines about why 
didn't they bomb the railroad
 tracks to Auschwitz?  Well
 they were bombing down 
the street s, the chem ic al fa
ctor ies and m is s ed them.  So who k nows ?  Their exc us e  
was that we would have kille
d Jews.  They were killed an
yhow.  And it would hav e  
saved some Jews maybe. 
 _______________, 
but I cannot tell you how I felt.  I 
came to Holland, 
was very lonesome, we clung to 
each other, the few Jews.  We 
really clung to each other 
and I used to travel all ov
er  the countr y and I had a 
chance, after, w
hen I got into this  
textile business, if 
I ________________
 to spend 
the weekends through, th

where they  had, ________
________ store, they had a 
dance in Amsterdam, 

________________  to
 the major cities, wh
ere some Jews  came
 back.  And about, 
I think 20,000 Jews came ba
ck in Holland.  Excu
se me.  So we fo
und each other. 
And t hen of  c our s e, I,  aft er, 
in 1946, your arm is going to
 get tired, le
t me hold that 
for you.
 
Q: No, it 's okay, I 
just ________________ .
 
A: In 1946, I decided that maybe that
 leads in to ____________
____  question, that 
I had t o get  out of m y own, 
oh, I didn't t e ll y o u t hat we
 finally found 
a house.  There 
was a house whic h was occupied
 by some Nazi in the city
 government, mayor, t he y  
got rid of him.  Was a Jewish home, wa
s a Jewish house, belonged to Jews from 

before the war.  And 
they, they ga
ve the house to 
us, to rent the house to my two 
uncles, my grandmother and
 me and my uncle, one of
 his closest friends, his 
widow, he was killed and she 
survived, she had 
no place to go 
either and she 
moved in, was our housekeeper
 and we were fr iends f or m a ny  y e ars.   She didn' t  
marr y my unc l e, s h e m arr ied a fr iend of an
other friend, my uncl
e m ar r ied s omebody 
else, it 's another story.
  Wait a minute, I th
ink she has to talk to me for a minute, my 
secretary, hold on. (
pause) ...together, we had
 a house and, yeah, 
I can do it later.
 
Q: Okay, go ahead.
 
A: ...and he says, well so and
 so, two sister s surviv ed, they  live in Utrecht(ph) and 
thos e t w o gir ls ,  one of t hem, was my s o-c a
lled, she was destiny 
and so I was I, that 
we would marry someday, when 
we were children.  Neve
r happened, bu
t we were 
alwa ys together, she was my
 same age, her name was 
Ruth and we found each 
ot her.  She and her s i ster hav e c om e bac k
 from Ausc hwitz and 
t h ey went t hr oug h 

hell, t h os e t w o gir l s, jus t  lik e 
we all did, but they 
more so.  And so then I went to visit 
them.
 
Q: Wait, now where were 
the girls, I'm sorry?
 
A: In Utrecht(ph), in 
Holland, in Utrecht(ph) is a maj or provinci
al town in the center 
of Holland.  It's like Ch icago here _
_______________ the railro
ads, you know.  And 
they wer e liv i ng wit h t heir m ot h er 's brot
her, who also surviv
ed and his wife, who 
was the daughter of 
a fam o us  r a bbi and s h e was  a 
physician.  And 
when I visit 
them, this man fascin
ated me no end and I, I must have
 done so to hi
m, he hired 
me.  He hir ed m e and he s a id, 
"I want y ou t o  go t o work fo
r me."  I said
, "But I want  
to get out of this small town
."  So they were in the sp
ic es bus i ness,  pepper s, pepp er  
and all this different 
and they had this  busi
ness before the 
war, he and his brother, 
his brother was killed, pa
rents were killed.  And 
I went to work for him 
________________  five
 days a week, from to
wn to town by trai
n in Holland.  But 
the condition of my hireme
nt, I had to live wi
th them because 
of a very, very 
religious, kosher.  
Now when I tell very 
religious, they dress 
like you and I, they 

weren't with the black 
hats, this we don't, 
we  didn't know that in
 Holland.  This was 
just people wh o lived very re
ligious.  An d did everything
 else, very sophisticated 
________________  
but they very religio
us, whic h you see here
 too, but when we  
talk  about religions or an
ything, it's all 
_______________, whic h is
 not the case, 
Holland didn't have th
at.  We never, I neve
r heard Yiddish in my 
life until I went t o  
the camp.  In Holland
 Yiddish wa s not known.  We 
didn't know, I ne
ver knew there 
was s u ch a thing.  We had 
Hebrew, we didn't u
nderstand all of i
t, but we studied all 
the time, we translated
.  But we never knew Yiddish, 
I learned it in the camps. 
Anyhow, so I had to live 
wit h t h em and s i nc e t h ey 
were so relig
ious, food was 
awfully abominable, bec
ause she was a terrible cook .  
Wonderful lady, but a terrible  
cook .  And,  and, s o I last

no good for me, I we nt and 
while I wa s there I ma

were in the camps 
toget her and we...
 
Q: You had known him before

A: Vaguely.  My sister knew him be

knew him becaus e 
________________  
an orphanage and the, we went

 love with he

Am eric an army chaplain, a Jewish chaplain, 
married t hem, right on
 site there.  The 
rush wa s okay, it worked
 out.  Sh e couldn't have 
children, they had done 
exper im ent s on her.  But s h e was lik e m y 
sister.   To a point,  
I can tell you when, 
after the war, I lived with them for, used to
 visit with them, I di
dn't live with them all 
the time, I used to 
visit, we slept on one
 m attr ess.  She was 
in, she was in the 
middle and we we
r e on each of t he, s he was lik e my
 sister, we were
 that close. 
They both dead now 
and he died v ery s adly.  Two y
ears ago he visited me and he 
had a heart attack he

 the wa y back.  He 
had been here 15 
times, lived in Rhodesia, Sa
lisbury, in Zimbabwe(ph).  I we nt to Americ a and he 
went t o Z i mbabwe( ph) because his c o us in 
gav e him a big job t h

Aus chwit z too.  And he us ed to have a 
kosher delicatessen.  And 
he became a big wheel in  th
e Dutc h, so- c alled blac k  

market, he did, you could do
 everything after the war,
 cause that's how people 
surviv ed, that's how people 
got food and coupons and th
at was an accepted thin g, 
because he didn't steal
 from  anybody, he was j ust  tr
ading.  But he was 
doing it on a 
very good sized 
scale.  An d maybe I should tell
 this story abou
t him because I 
admired him so much.  He 
survived, his wife and two 
children were killed and by 
pure accident he fo
und and I don't kn
ow again, know how, th
rough the Red Cr oss I 
thin k again.  Be cause in 
Holland, published 
names of people w

the Red Cr os s k ept on publis

at t hose lists, t hat ' s how a 
cous in of  ours f ound my gr andm ot her.
  He read that she was safe in 
Ther es ienst adt.
 
Q: Where were the lists publis hed?
 
A: In the Jewish press, 
there's a Jewish press, ve
ry ________________ 
.  So my 
friend found his sister's da
ughter in Poland, he had come
 from Poland as a young 
boy and he went, this guy c
ould mov e m ount a ins, and he 
went t o Poland and f o un d 
this  girl, brought her back 
to Holland in 1946 
and she had no place to
 live, he had a 
house, she moved in with
 him.  She wa s 18, 16, 
18, ________________  18 by 
now.   And t hey f e ll in lov e
 and he want to marry
 her, except in 
Holland you can't do 
that, t hat ' s against  the law.
  And s o he made a r equest  
to Queen Wilhemina, is  the 
only one who can do this
, only the Queen and she ca
n give you permission,  
what ever that' s, t hat ' s c a ll
ed.  And she wr ote him back t
here's no way I can do that, 
we don't do this 
and denied.  So 
he, when he cam e  bac k fr
om the c a mps,  he c a me 
back on a stretcher and on 
t h at hos p ital wher e he was  
brought in over the border, 
the Pr incess Julianna(ph), she visits ho
spitals, ________________
 like to visit 
hospitals _______________, wonderful family. 
 And she visit that hospital and he 
was laying in the bed
, he had come back 
out of Auschwitz and 
they took a picture 
of her standing at his bed.  
An d she said to him, "If ther
e's ever anythi
ng I can do 
for you, feel free, yo
u can call m e ."  W h ic
h is , wh ic h is  like g i
ving you a check you 
can cash when you need it, 
you know.  So he
, so he wrote a le
tter after the Queen 
turned him down, to the Pr incess,  said, "I want
 you to talk to your  mother , I want to 
marry my niece."  An
d the Pr inc es s wr ot e him a le
tter back, t hese ar e all t r ue 
stor ies.  "I can't give you 
permission, my mot her
 doesn't waiv e, no
 she said so as 
you well know, but if 
someday in the fu
ture, it will all, things
 work out 
normal, I will 
be Queen, I'm in su
ccession and then 
you try again."  1948, two years later, 
Wilhemin a abdicated her thr
one to her daughter, he didn
't wait three weeks, he 
wr it es a lett er to t h e Queen, then,  "Rem em
ber me?  Here's t he 
pict ur e."  She gav e  
permission and they married. 
 And they had two 
wonderful girls, th
ey all live in 
Israel except he died on 
a trip in, he dropp
ed dead in  a __
______________ at an 
airport.  But before 
that, when I was in 
Switzerland, Emil was 
in contact, he called 
me one day, he says, Em il was making d
eals, Am erican dolla
rs, gold, you know 
and he says, "I 'm coming in such and
 such a date next 
week and I'm in a 

wheelchair and you have to get 
m e off t he plane in Z ur i ch. "
  I knew this was all a 
scam, I knew right away that
 he wasn't in a wheelchair,
 but he sat in  a wheelchair 
and what he had, he had, he
 wa s sitting on a wheelchai
r,  on a c us h ion wh ic h was, 
which had maybe, in today's 
dollar, in those do
llars, maybe three 
million dollars in 
Belg ium and Indonesia n and Du
tch government bo
nd, who were tota
lly worthless. 
Wort hles s bec aus e the Dut c h gover nm ent ma
de an edict in '45,
 about within a 
month or two aft er the lib
er at ion, that ever y one 
who had dollar s, I m ean 
gildens(ph), in Holland
, had to turn them in and ever
y person aliv e in Holland got 10 
gildens(ph) that day.  Ev er
y st ock cert if icat e 
had t o be tur ned in and t h ey forced 
every corporatio n 
or government _
_______________ to
 is sue all new ones, 
bec aus e the Germ ans had f a ls if
ied s o many .  They had em
pt ied all the 
safe depos i t  
box, depos i t boxes of t he 
J e ws and ot hers.  So no 
one knew who was what and 
who owned what.  So Dutch 
________________  made 
a cutoff day in
 '45, that no 
one was worth more than
 10 dollars.  The phony 
money, the ________________ 
money, you went to the banks
, later on, every we
ek you could get, 
release some of  
it because they couldn't gi
ve it to you _______
_________ , they had 
to print it and 
finally everybody got dolla
r f o r dollar and the Dutc
h, what ev er t h ey  did 
economically.  So he now,  so
 now it 's 1948, ab
out  t hat  tim e and 
he ran into a guy 
who says, " Y ou k now, I  found in the bac ky ar d
 of my uncle , a whole box full of thes e 
bonds, they're worthless."  So
 my friend is sm art, he sa
ys, "Well, " he says, "maybe I  
can do something with that."
  So he gave the guy, he
 says, "I'll give you 5, 00 0 
dollars for it , as a fri
end,", this man say, "but you have 
to deliv er it in 
New York."  So 
I had friends in New York, 
but ________________ Am
erican army, sold
iers I met. 
And I arranged that I deposit 
some money in, it's a compli
cated situatio
n, but I got

York,  thr o ugh t he Swiss,  
thr o ugh a Swis s bank .  
________________  
but I had access to, to
 the business.  An d 
he put up 2500, I 
put up 2500.  So now we ow
n all these shares 
and he comes to Zu
rich, I take him 
off t h e plane and he's  got a 
whole big suit case sitting on
 him and a pillow.  And I 
have no way what to do with
 it, I' v e nev er done t h is bef or
e.  I was leav ing t he nex t  
day for Lougano(ph), where 
we  also had a little office and
 I stayed in th
is  hotel for a 
couple of years and 
I got to know the owner and 
I thought they ar
e very nice 
people.  So that night, 
I had dinner wi
th them _
_______________  th
e hotel and 
then I  tell t hem, t he biggest par t of t he part of t h is st ory ,
 he says, "I know who can 
help y o u, I can help y o u," he sa
ys,  "but the m an you t alk to 
is a lawyer in Zurich."  I 
said, "I j ust cam e fr om Zur i
ch."  He said, "Oh, you got 
t o  go bac k."  So I went bac k  
to Zurich and I met this lawyer, I gave him 
a sample.  From that, within three days I 
was followed by two  plainclo
thesmen.  I was followed fo
r two weeks.  Two weeks, 
it wa s in 1 9 ,  in A u gu st ' 49 ,  s umme r of ' 4 9. 
 And finally I got so 
scared, I said there's 
nothing I can do, they keep on
 following me and I don't know
 if t he y were
 police or  
they were gangsters.  
I thought about police. 
 So I walk ed up to 
t hem , they 'r e sitt ing 
on a s i dewalk c af e and I sat, I s at  down next 
to them, right on the 
table, I said, "Ar e  

you f o llowing me?"  T here 
was a younger man and
 an older man, 
they said, "No, 
I'm not."  I said, "Well, yo
u ar e.  Last week  was s o
mebody els e, but ther e wa s  
________________  two pe
ople following me."  So I fi
gured I got to
 have an 
emotional confrontation here, 
so I said, "Look, I know wh
at you wa nt, but I'm scared 
and I don't know how to handle this," 
_______________, show t
hem a number on 
my arm.  I said, "Look, I'm not a g
angster, I'm a surviv or ________________  the 
camps, ________________  
I'm not a thief, I haven't do
ne anything wr
ong."  An d 
this man says to me, "You di
d something wrong,
 you're peddling 
illegal documents, 
I mean stocks, bonds and th
at 's  not done in this c o
untry," he says.  " A nd we'r e 
going to put you in ja
il becaus e you're trying to sell
 t h at ."  And y
ou, and we, and I 
didn't know if  it was that, wh
ic h, t hat' s what  he t o ld me
, but I'd also been buying u p  
gold and I was smuggling it ou
t of Switzerland to
 Holland, gold coins.
  But you, and 
in Holland I could, could ma
ke a huge profit  every ti
me I and I us
ed packs of 
cigarettes, you know 
and things like that to smuggl
e them over th
e border.  And 
________________  ma
ybe and I thought that 
could be also it .  
So he says, "Kno w 
what y ou'r e  doing, y ou' re s e lling t h ings." 
 So he says, I said, 
" H ow c a n I, how can I  
stop this?"  Says,  "I 'll t e ll
 you what we 'll do,"  He 
was an older ma
n and he became 
ver y sym pathet ic.  He says, "S
ee my c ar t h er e?"  " Yeah. "  
I was in Zurich.  He said, 
"We ar e going t o t h e air por
t right now and I'm going to
 dr op you of f there and yo u 
get out of t h is country and nev er com e back
."  I says, "Okay."  
What was I going t o  
do ?  A l l m y  s u its wer e in t h
e hot el r oom, all my c l ot hes.
  Ne ver went back to the 
hotel,  he wouldn't let me
 and to the airport. 
 Put me on a plane.  
I walk in my bosse s  
off ic e in Amster dam and I say,
 "I quit. "  He said, "W hy?" 
 I say, "I hate you."  I 
couldn't tell him wh y I was 
quit, I was doing on his time
, all this black market 
bus i ness.  So I never went bac k t o Swit
z er l and for a long t i
me, until maybe 1980, 
the middle 80' s wit h m y fam i ly.  Bec a us e 
now I had an Am eric an
 passport you see, 
they couldn't do anything
.  But that's, that's my
 friend, ________________ .  I 
mean, great stor
ies, as far as I'
m concerned, so.  
I still have a suit 
somewhere's in a 
hotel r o om in Z ur i ch.
 
Q: Now, what happened
 to him and wh at 
happened to the...
 
A: She went, he dropped that, t
hey had moved to Los An geles.
 
Q: But bef ore t hat
, with bonds?
 
A: Nothin g.  Oh.  I couldn't
 have them, I coul
dn't have a safe depo
sit in Switzerland 
after he gave them to 
me, so I gave this to a girlfriend
 I was dating, th
is girl I told 
you about whose moth
er wa sn't Jewish?
 
Q: Cecile?
 
A: Cecile.  You want
 to hear this now?
 

Q: Okay.
 
A: Cecile, so we were goin
g st eady, k i nd of, we wer e v e
ry c l os e and gr eat fr iends  
with a beautif ul girl.  She 
was younger, she was about two 
years younger than I am.  
And I left Switz er l and, went 
back to Holland in August 
of ' 4 9 and in Dec e mber I  
came to Americ a.  I, 
and then in '53, in '
52, we kept on 
corresponding.  In '52, early 
'52, we dec i ded s he would c ome here.   And no
w it goes in the middl
e t o t h e, in th e, 
in the end of '52 and 
she had worked all the, 
for a number of year
s, in a children's 
home,  where t h ey had c h ild
ren from England, wh ich 
was c omm on in Eur o pe, 
________________  
took children in moun
tain s in Swit zerland wh o had TB.  And 
for s om e reas on in those days, t h e air in 
Swit zerland, and the re
st, could cure them, 
today y ou hav e m edic i ne.  So s he work ed t here.  And the reas on she wor k ed t h er e 
is, she didn't have to fin
ancia lly because her family 
had enough, she 
wanted learn 
English language and figured 
that would be the easiest 
because she was going to 
Am er ic a.  She wor k ed t h ere and, when 
she we nt to her vi
sa, to the Am erican 
cons ul,  they had,  s h e had to 
have an X-ray taken, it 's  
the law in thos
e days.  And 
she had TB.  Poor girl, she had contracted 
TB from being around
 those children. 
And they wouldn't
 let her in this coun
try, they wouldn't le
t her in.  And it was 
devastating for her and
 for me too, it wa
s disappointing becaus
e, and t h at was t he 
end of ' 52, it goes into '53 
and all of a s u dden I'm draft e d in the ar my, Kor ean war .  
________________  the 
Korean war here. 
 So I'm go in the army
,  I said there's no 
way I can bring this  girl 
over here.  I mean
 ________________ I can, I was makin g  
72 buc ks  a month in t h e army, 
I had no money,
 I had nothing.
 
Q: And how old are you at this point?
 
A: Now I'm 25, 25, yeah it wa
s 19, let me see, 25
, 26.  And so I wr
it e h er a lett er, I  
said I 'm sorry.  I  couldn't te
ll her that I didn't  want 
her to come, I 
couldn't tell 
bec aus e I wouldn' t  marry if she had T B, 
I was sc ar ed, in thos e days , y ou didn ' t  

know t h at T B was c u rable, 
in t h e ear ly 50' s, it was a 
ver y ser i ous m att er, I was 
scared to death.  So what
 did I, I said __
______________ some ot
her girl here, 
that's how terrible _____________
___ , I lied, there was no 
such thin g.  And then 
she wr ot e me one more lett er
 back, whic h I  nev e
r want ed t o r ead again, I  thr e w it  
away real fast because it wa
s, it was horr ible.  Anyhow
, so I had to contact here 
before that though, 
because all those bonds
, she had in her sa
fe deposit box an d 
my friend ___________
_____ , he went there 
and met her.  He me
t her I think once 
before with me and he picke
d them up so that's the 
end of that story and h e  
dropped it, my friend.  I don'
t know wh at happened 
to this girl.  I ca
n't find out and I 
shouldn't find out, 
I'm married now.
 
Q: Did in part you, did in pa
rt that feeling like I surviv
ed the camp, I mean the first 
thought that comes to my mi
nd is, y o u s urv iv ed  W or l d W ar 2, y ou s urv ived t he 
camps, you didn't want to
 get  T B at that point.
 

A: Well, let me tell you what
 happened to me af
ter the war, that 
I haven't said that 
too often, hardly ever
, I don't think I ever told  my fa
mily.  When I got out of the 
camp, I knew I was sick.  I k
new I was sick.  I went t hr o
ugh ev ery doc t or I c ould ge t  
in.  First our family
 doctor, small town, 
I said, "I have TB."  Why?  Becaus e 
everybody else come
s out of the camps 
has TB, ________________ 
.  Do ctor said,  
"No, you don't have TB."  Six months I went ba
ck t o  t he doct or, "I'm  sick,  I have 
TB."  I didn't feel si
ck, I had it in my he
ad t h at I was, t h at I 
was s i c k.  T h en I went  
from Ber culo(ph)  t o Utrec ht(
ph), I went three 
___ t o t he univ ers i ty, f o ur or fiv e  
doct ors in a row, "I have TB
."  And they kept on saying
, "You don't have
 it, we can't 
find it. "  I went to Swit zer l
and and the s ame thin
g.  I had t h is c onstant fear, t hat I  
would end up having TB, beca
use there was no 
medicine.  I know that my 
colleagues, a lot of th
em had TB that I knew
  and were living with
 t h is  an d dy ing o f  
it.  And I thought 
I had TB.  I didn't 
have TB, I wouldn'
t be s itt ing her e.
 
Q: But s h e had T B and she was wantin
g to come to America with it.
 
A: T his stor y I nev er t o ld her  of  c o urs e. 
 No, she didn't know, 
she was coming here 
then she f o und out s h e had T B 
when she had to t ak e an 
X-ray.  The doct or s found 
it, t h e Amer ic an c o ns ulat e.  So t
hat's kind of a sad story because...
 
Q: Very sad.
 
A: ... she was a, s he wa
s a beautif ul girl, a terrif ic  girl
 and we liked eac
h ot her a lot, I  
remember that, but 
________________ , but a pa
st love affair, everyone has ha d 
thos e.  And not, it' s not ma
k e an exc ept ion wit h me.  So
 that, I tell you all my 
bubbameisers(ph) here.  You know wh at bu
bbameis ers(ph) are?  
I tell you all my 
bubbameisers(ph) here.  Cause 
they come to me while I'm sitting here thinking.  I  
must  tell y ou, t hat  I start e d say i ng ear lie
r,  my book start s wi
t h a line that  I' v e  
________________  heard.  It 
takes 40 years to reme
mber if  something bad 
happens to you, that's in
 the, ________________
  in one of th
e books of our 
religion.  In another __
______________ mishna
, it  says that 
at one of the 
________________ , 
one of the rabbis said it takes 
40 years for a 
human being to 
rem ember som et h ing bad, if
 s o met h ing bad happens  to him t h at the y c a n talk  
about, takes 40 years to clea
r out your mind.   And I must say, the man said it 
maybe a thousand years 
ago or 800 years ago, I agree
 with that.  
I didn't think 
about other things, I didn't 
think about the camps,  you know, you think about  it.  Not 
the way I think about it today.  I took s
howers all thos e y e ars, 
didn't bother me, now 
when I take a shower in th
e m or n ing, I'm f eeling my ba
ck cause I have 
scar s.  Now 
I feel it ev er y day.  I don't f
eel, I've never felt it.  Smell.
  I can't st and chlor i ne sm ell,  
bec aus e that' s all we smelled 
in the camps.  This, this, 
they spread chlo
rine on, a l l 
ov er.  I sm ell it mor e now t han I  ev er di
d.  Just in general
, t h oughts about  my  
childhood.  People have, peopl
e have said that you reme
mber.  I'm, I feel I'm 
com i ng out of a hy pnos is finally, aft er 50 y ear s .
 

Q: Why do you thin k that's happening?
 
A: I t ' s bec a us e t h at 's  what  t he r a bbi s a id, 
it  takes 40 years to, to, to remember if  
something sad happened to y
ou, like you don't want to
 remember and it had to 
com e out of  your system maybe.  I t 's no
t, it's not, ther
e's no im pact on my life.
 
Q: It's a safe e
nough distance?
 
A: Oh yeah, I can live with 
it, because I have to live with
 it  and I have
 enough other 
things which attract me
, m y work  and I lik e 
to work, I really  enjo
y my work, I love to 
work.  An d my family a
nd my grandchildren.  So 
I have ___________
_____  being 
pulled away, ________________ and I 
do a lot of things that
 I enjoy, various things.
 
Q: Let me have you 
go back and that...
 
A: My mother's br other left 
in the, in the 30's, to Un
it ed St ates.   His  wif e  had 
relativ es here.  And t hey liv e
d her e  in San Fr anc i sc o, t
hey mov e d here.  And, whe n  
the war was ov er, I c o nt act e d 
him and my, and his 
and  the t w o uncles, I t a lk e d t o  
in the c am p, I said br ot her.  
And I finally we nt here, my un
cles didn't want to go to 
Am er ic a, t h ey wer e too old 
by t h en, they t h ought and c
ouldn't m a ke a liv i ng here,  
the language.  So I went and
 he had two children.  My 
uncle and aunt died in th e 
meantim e.  My uncle _____
___________  left, he 
died in 1951, so
 I only saw him 
for a little  over a year.  My
 aunt died later, she had be
come a very g
ood friend of 
my wife's.  They beca
me v ery c lose, t h os e t w o.  A ve
r y beaut if u l wom an.   And the y  
hav e t w o c h ildr en, a boy  and a 
girl.  The girl lives
 in New York, I'm 
very clos e to, we 
talk to each other almost ev
ery week.  My cousin, the 
boy, we never talk.   We 
talk ed last  year or  t wo y ear
s ago, but he, he has got a ha
ng up with Jews.  So he's 
married to a non-Jew, whic h is
 his business.  But 
he, he is, he
's anti-Sem it ic almost.  
It bot hers me no end.   He's  got
 a terrible anti, he
's anti-Israel and he
 doesn't talk  t o  
his sister hardly either.  His 
sister Phyllis, who 
is n ot in v o lv e d in 
the Jewish world as 
such, ev en though s h e is mar r ied t o 
a J e w and m arr ied t o a ter r if ic guy.
 
Q: Why do you t h ink he?
 
A: I have no idea, 
I have no idea why he is, he's so
 anti anything 
Jewish, he makes 
very nasty remarks abou
t it and he knows how I feel, he 
knows how his sister feels. 
And his aunts, who ar e dead now, his c ous ins.
  He has very
 little cont
act with the 
family.  He was sales mana
ger  f or Lev i- Str auss , he' s not an inc o mpetent  human 
being.  He, he was in southe
rn California, the bi
g territory for Levi
-Strauss.  Levi's 
________________  and he
's retired now, I think.  
He ran for ma
yor of Sant a 
Barbara , he's no slouc
h, but I will, I don't wa
nt to talk  to him. 
 I don't thin
k he wants 
to talk to me either. 
 It's a mutual thing.
 
Q: Would you repeat about...
 

A: He doesn't talk  to his 
own child, he has a 
daughter, who lives 
up here and my 
daughter, they talk  to each
 other, but he do
esn't talk to his 
own daughter, so  
________________  
see there's somethin
g wrong with him.
 
Q: The, about how you re
membered the address.
 
A: I don't  know, I remember more things 
from my childhood at 
times, like 
addresses 
than I remember what happened 
yesterday.  I forget who, 
I forgot who I have lunch 
with, see I got to think.  
But I do remember  things wa
y back.  They com e back now,  
they open part of me, they open up now. 
 A psychologist would have a heyday wit h 
me, a psychiatrist would 
have a heyday with 
me.  I wa s offered by
 a psychiatrist, he 
wanted to do, really go th
rough sessions and se
ssions with me and I said, "Not a 
chance, I don't 
need that."  
 
Q: But y o u were s ay i ng t hat y ou,  
you had hear d the addres s of y o ur ...
 
A: W e ll, my  mother us ed t o wr it e them al
l t he tim e, y o u k now and f or  som e reas on I  
thought, I remember my gr
andmother's phone number.
 
Q: What was it?
 
A: Number 2.  Sh e lived 
in a town, there were abou
t 3,000 people at the most, 
maybe even 1500, I don'
t know.  They were the only Jews in that town, my mother 's 
mot her , the one who went t o T h er es ienst a
dt.  An d there were two phones in the 
town, one was at city  hall and t he s ec o
nd one was m y, my f am ily bec a us e they  
could afford it, the re
st...  I told you, we 
were in good shape. 
 I know my parents 
phone number, 270.  I 
don't know, why woul
d I remember them, 
________________ .  
I don't remember numbers I've
 had in here, in
 this city.
 
Q: But the most...
 
A: T h at I remem ber .  I do not r e mem ber 
my phone numbers I 
had before we got 
marr ied, say, or the off i ce 
num ber,  I wor ked in an off ic e 
for 18 y e ars until we s o ld it,  
I have no idea.  I 
remember the street
 address, but 
I don't remember the phone 
number.  I should, right
?  Logically I should.
 
Q: It's not logic.
 
A: No, it 's ___________
_____ , but I re
member my parents ph
one number and my, 
look, there were 7,
000 people in that town, mayb
e, it was 270, 
wonder why I 
remember t hat.
 
Q: Do you remember songs
 from your childhood?
 
A: No, not really, 
no.  I don't remember. 
 That's a good
 question, no one ever asked 
me t hat .  O h, c h ildr en' s s o ngs, whic h ar e,
 m ay b e, t h ings lik e t hey s i ng,  s i ng now.
 

Q: Such as?  ____
____________  sing a little bi
t of it if you could?
 
A: I don't remember
.  But every __________
______  I hear chil
dren sing this, we 
used to sing t
he same melody.
 
Q: Do y o u r em ember y our mother ev er, or 
your f ather ev er s i
nging you lullabies?
 
A: My mot her must have, my f at her was 
very mus ic a l,  he lik e d to, he play ed the 
harmonica.  He loved that.  T
hey couldn't afford 
violins, things li
ke that, but they 
weren't on that lev e l.   
None of,  none of t he J ews
 in wher e I  was bor n an d 
________________  I ever went 
to college, they didn't, mo
st of them, I don't thin k 
that, I don't kn
ow how many went to high school 
ev en.   That wasn't   d o ne, nobod y  
went  on, t h ey didn't have t h os e t h ings.  T h
ey went to elementary
 school eight years 
and ________________ , that was 
enough and that's all they
 had to, to
 be.  And 
except m y  mot her had one
 c o us in who was a phys ic
ian, the rest were all 
merchants. 
 
Q: Well let's go back to yo
u telling the man that you 
hated working 
for him in 
Ams t er d am .
 
A: Oh, you mean when I quit?
 
Q: Mm-hm, then what happened?
 
A: T h en I c a lled my unc l e in
 San Francisco, that wa s in
 August, end of Augu st o f  
'49, called my uncle here in
 San Francisco, I said, "I 
want  y o u t o send m e  th e 
paper s."  He j ust  k e pt on 
wr it ing me all t h e t im e, com e  ov er her e, com e over  here 
and I didn't want, I didn't know. 
 I wasn't r e ady yet  
and I wasn't ready to
 go to Israel. 
For  s om e r eas on that had no f e
eling for me at
 that time.
 
Q: Why do you t h ink t h at was?
 
A: Bec a us e I was in t h e wr ong m
ilieu, most likely.  I didn't, lu
ckily I think, that I didn't 
get into the DP camps, wh
ic h happened to most
 of them.  Most of the eastern 
European Jews really 
couldn't go back behind the 
Iron Curtain, but Ho lland and 
Belg ium and France, they
 all went back to their countrie
s.  An d why didn't I want to 
go to, I don't know, I 
just  wasn't  ready yet.  I was, it
 wasn't, I wasn't ready, eve n  
though my unc l e want ed m e t o c om e her e.  
So I, I got a hold of 
my uncle and I say, 
"I want to c om e now."  And by the end of 
August he t h ink s that 
he has set things in 
motion and the fifth of 
December, I left Ho lland
.  You couldn't get 
on the boats, this  
was a v ery  ser i ous pr oblem and thr ough, th
rough another friend 
I go t on the boat 
bec aus e t h is was  a big steel c o mpany wit h  
offices in, in Holland
, in New York, in 
England and they had guaran
teed seats on these ship
s leavin g Holland because 
for the c om m erc e, br ing the c o
m m erc e back  and they gav e m e one of t h eir s eats .  
It's a mutual friend and he
 arranged it and that's how
 I got ________
________  to 

New York.  And I spen
t about three weeks tr
aveling, sitting in 
New York with my 
unc l e' s wif e , my aunt, her s i
ster and I we nt to Ph iladel
phia to see a friend who ha d 
sur v ived, I was in the cam p s 
wit h  and t hen I went t o Ch
icago to see another friend 
of mine and then I went to 
San Francisco, by train.
 
Q: What were you thinki
ng on the boat over?
 
A: I was very excited to, to get to Am er ica,
 we had this huge dr
eam of  Amer ica,  it' s  
a garden of Eden 
and all this.  I knew my cabin, ther
e ar e four people in t he cabin, it  
was very packed.  But it  wa
s ov er whelm i ng.  We went t o
 Berm uda,  went  f irst  fr om  
Holland to England, to Sout hampt on, t
hen they stopped and
 they st opped i n  
Bermuda, it wa s beautiful, Inever seen this kind of 
tropics and this kind of 
env ir onment.  And t h en New Yo
r k,  St at ue of  Liber ty.   And,
 but it was al
l, you know, 
it 's so overwhelming
, people, people thin k they rememb
er details, I 
don't remember, 
it gets overwhelming, things of
 im portance.  You f or g et the 
em ot ions I t h ink, y ears.  
We act and look an
d then observe.
 
Q: Did you speak any En
glish at that point?
 
A: Very little, hardly anythi
ng.   I' ll give y o u an exam ple 
how much Englis
h I spoke. 
After I'd been here for a fe
w, a  f e w we e ks,  I h ad a t e
rrible st y on 
my eye,  so 
someone says, "Well go
 to the Mount Zion clinic," 
whic h as you know, the Jewis h  
hospital here was then.  So I went to th
e doc t or and he says, I rem em ber, I don't  
know why I remember that.  He said, "Does it
 hurt?"  And I said, 
"It's ver y painless. " 
So he says, "Painless?  Yo
u m e an painful?"  I s a id, " N o,
 painles s."  No wher e' d I  
get the word painless?  When 
I used to be on 
the bus to go to work, there was an 
advertis ing dentist, he was called painless 
Parker.  So I thoug
ht, pain, painless, 
painf u l, what' s t h e, s o  I t e ll
 him no, it 's very painless, 
he says painful.  That's how 
much English I spoke, now 
you know.  But I le arned fast, I went to school every 
night.
 
Q: Wher e?
 
A:  ___ high school in, 
four high schools.  Washin
gton High, Ba lboa High, 
Comm erc e  High and Miss ion High.   Ev er
y night  t h at Englis h class, t h ey  had 
diff erent nights, M o nday, T u es day, W ednes d
ay, Thursdays.  We

high school from seven to 
nine and I liv e d in a boar d in
g house, in a boar ding hous e 
on W a shingt on Str e et,  right n
ear t he Jewis h comm unity cent er, I us ed t o go t h er e.  
________________  
night time before, 
I usually worked, I 
worked quit e a bit.
 
Q: What... [end of si
de 1 of tape 2]
   Okay, so...
 
A: ________________  
do you have to close that?
 
Q: Thank you.
 

A: Will it 
work without?
 
Q: Y ea h, it ' l l wor k, but  it ju st k e e ps t h e d u
st  out, it k eeps it m ore pr otect ed.  So,  
what work were you doi
ng when you cam e her e?
 
A: The same, real estate.
 
Q: Immediately?
 
A: But, well I was hired by 
this  man, because when I ca
me here my 
uncle had got 
me a job wit h in a week or 
two to sell to the rest aur
ants and apart
ment houses, 
deodorants and disinfectants 
and soaps and toilet paper, 
you know, those janitorial 
supplie s.  It was awful,  it  
was terrible  and they didn't pa
y me.  And so 
then I heard, 
hav i ng m et  by now s o me people,  that t h e 
Jewish family and ch
ildren's servic e had 
an employment committe
e and I went there and I met th
is wonderful lady, her name 
was Paula Shirnholtz(ph), I'll 
never forget that. 
 An  elderly person, she worked there 
as a c as e work er and I told 
her that I needed a job and 
she says, "Well we ha ve a 
committee and I will take y
our case to the co
mmittee tomorrow ni
ght and then you'll 
hear fr om me."  W e ll, the next m or ning, or
 the, the morning after, she says, "Here, 
go see Mr. Alberton at 157 Sutter and 
he, he' s a member of t h e c omm itt e e, he 
want s t o s e e y o u."  So I went
 in t h er e, ther e's  anot her 
m an s itt ing t h er e wait ing and 
he int er v iewed me and he s a id, "You k now 
what the real estate
 means?"  "No, I 
don't know."  He hired me
, at, and his partner, there we
re two partne
rs, a younger 
partner, his partner says,
 "____ the guy c
an't speak Englis h, what do yo u 
________________ ,"
 you know, somebody
 _______________
___________ 
when he was in his late
 60's, early 70's
, very compassionate,  
v er y f i ne pers on an d 
he hired me.  So I ha
d to put up s i gns and c o llect r e nt. I  didn't hav e to be a sc ient ist  
for that, right?  So that wa
s in 1915, and then
 I st arted slowly 
making leases and 
making sales and then, then 
the army came, had 
to be in  the ar
my for two years.
 
Q: Now, why did you have
 t o be in the ar my ?
 
A: I was dr aft ed.
 
Q: But had you, when di
d you get citizenship?
 
A: I n t he ar my.
 
Q: You wer e draft e d bef ore y ou had c it iz e ns hip?
 
A: Yeah.  That wa s th
e law then.  I was dr
afted and then 
I went to the draft boar d  
and I t o ld t hem my sad st or y.  I didn't, m y
 boss did.   So the dr
aft board says, "Well, 
we can handle, we  ca
n change that, why doesn't he go and join
 the reserve unit  
and go into the ________________
 , the army base here on
ce a month and he can 
do it for  a num ber of y ears and he
 does n't hav e t o go in the ar my. "
 

Q: Now when you say, I 
told t hem my s a d st or
y, what do you m e an?
 
A: Well I told  them I alread
y was in a war.  And I don't
, I didn't go 
into details 
bec aus e ther e was s o me lady s itt in
g there, she wouldn't have known.
 
Q: Did you tell them yo
u were in t h e c am ps ?
 
A: Yeah, I told them I was in
 t h e cam p s and I was in the, 
in t he, in the, an d t hat ,  
because I said I didn't want
 to go in any more wars. 
 But it didn't m a ke an y  
difference to them, that's just
 a book and they fo
llowed the book.  
They didn't have 
anything in the book that 
you can't take guys with my 
back gr ound.  So t h ey said ,  
"Well, I want to be,"  she 
want to be nic e t o me, r eally
 nic e, and s h e s a id, "W ell g o  
to t he ___ and j o in t h e r es erv e unit, y o u go
 onc e a m o nt h on T
uesday nights and, 
and, and you don't hav
e to be dr aft ed. "  I did t h at, bu
t they dr aft e d t h e unit,  they 
took t h e whole damn unit aft er six mo
nths going throug
h, through this 
________________  thin g.
  And ended up in  Fort 
Worth, 16 weeks of basic 
training, I was t he oldest m
an in the plat oon.  He c a ll
ed m e Pop, c au s e it was all 
young kids, they we re 19 and 
20 year olds and I was 26. 
 And then, then I went to 
For t  Lewis,  they  wer e going t o
 send me to Germ any, I refused to go to Germ any.  
They said, "You got 
________________ ."  
I said, "I don't care, 
but I'm not going to 
Germ any. "  So I went up to 
Fort Lewis on the wa
y to Korea and they 
kept me ther e.  
I became a supply sergeant. 
 I came out as 
a sergeant, whic h is
 pretty good.
 
Q: How did you f e el, being in t h e ar my?
 
A: I hated it  but I lik
ed it  als o bec a us e,  in retr os
pect  mor e so,  I,
 I never knew 
Am er ic ans.  In San Francisco, the Jewish 
commun it y center, I go
 to the Temple, I  
go, made a few Jewish fr
iends there, met over 
________________  and some 
fam i ly,  my aunt and unc l e.  
And I never knew the Am eric an
s.   So being in t he arm y  
I met the Poles, from  Chicago and t h en 
t h e Blac ks fr om the s o ut h and t h e, an d 
they, and t he Jews fr om Brook
ly n, I met ev ery Am er ic an t h er e is.   Indians.  And ,  
whic h amazed me the most
 was when I was the suppl
y sergeant this
 young man 
us ed to c o me down and s ay, 
" Can y o u read me t he lett er
 from my mot h
er?"  They 
couldn't read and wr it e ye
t, people who had come in 
the army coul
dn't read an d 
write, they were so 
illiterate.  And mo
stly out of Tennessee and
 Indians out from the 
reservations.  And I was t
heir interpreter and I wr ot
e letters for those kids. 
 
Q: You, wh o wa s just learning Englis h yourself?
 
A: Myself, yeah, but , but I, I 
could wr it e them a lett er to 
their, to their parents, a nd 
they, they all, excuse
 me, they were very, 
v ery good k i ds and 
then they brought a 
lot of M orm ons in fr om  Utah, who were ve
ry dis c iplined and v er y
 st raight and, and 
ot her s, but. ..
 

Q: Do you remember the 
content of any letter yo
u wr ot e f or s om e body ?
 
A: Not, these ________
_______.  Dear Ma
ma, I'm fine, how are 
you?  Yeah.  Hop e  
you're fine and goodbye.  
We went, we had in
spection yesterday, or we took a 
marc h.  T h es e kids wer en't college mat er i al
.  But the, the Indi
ans were very good, 
they made very good sharps
hooters.  But then I met Bl
acks, whic h I'd never met 
before.  I met people fr
om all over the, diff
erent nationalities a
nd background, so, so 
in retrospect, I still correspo
nd with, with 
s ev er al of t hem, from t he army .  Boy s who,  
boys , boys,  they 'r e not  boy s, 
t hey' r e now in t hei
r 60's, who are in
 Montana, one in 
Wyomin g, one in  Ne w York, on
e in Seattle.   Christmas ti
me we send, we
 send eac h  
ot her Chr i st mas cards.
 
Q: Now one thin g I notice 
about you, you keep ev
erybody in your life.
 
A: Not really.  I can give yo
u a longer list from people I 
don't want to talk to any 
more.
 
Q: Yeah, but there's an
 awful lot of people you keep tr
ack of and y ou st ay in t ouc h 
with.
 
A: Well, well, yes, not a lot any mo
re, it 's, because 
________________  people 
who hav e not s h own loy a lty to
 me and if they don't show
, t h en I dr op them, t h en I  
can't handle it.  But people over the years,
 we stay in touch.
  Now this army 
sit u at ion goes bac k, it' s  only
 onc e a y e ar, Christmas t im e
 and, and f r om t he c a mps,  
the only friend I had really from the camps is
 the one wh o dropped 
dead in the, just 
two y ear s ago, my fr iend Hans, we wer e v e
ry, very close.  Another fellow I was in 
the camps with lives in Paris.
  I met him twic e in Israel
, it so happened,
 because we 
hav e a m ut ual fr iend 
now.  I'm in, in, 
in, in touch with his mutu
al friend I met when I 
was on the board of 
governors of  the Jewish agenc
y and we have 
become ver y  
good friends, the four 
of us.   But this  other boy wa s 
in the camp
, we had no
thing to 
talk about to him.  He s
peaks very hard Englis h be
c ause he's a F r e nc hm an f r om 
Reeon(ph) and we met twic
e and I thought maybe should 
get together more, but 
there was nothing to talk about.
 
Q: While you were 
in the army, were you 
telling, or in Americ
a, did you tell people 
about what  you' d been thr
ough, did you t e ll 
them about  the cam p s  and W or ld War  
2?
 
A: Unt i l a f e w y ear s a go ,  ma yb e  no w it 's 
10 y ears, 12 years, not  more t h an 15 ,  
nobody knew that I'd be
en in the camps,
 I never talk ed about it, 
I didn't tell anybody.  
People maybe, maybe people knew, people didn't
 ask me, I didn't tell them.  People 
didn't know.  I got involv
ed, through the Jewish family, _________
______, called 
me one day and I wa s 
active in the federation in 
'55 or, I mean every campaign 
since 1955.   But ear l y Rob c a lled me, he 
s ay s, " L ook, t h er e was an inc i dent with 

the Na zis in the sunset dist
rict and we  have to organize 
the survivors here.  I know 
you're one," and we knew each 
other fairly well. 
 He said, "And I want  you to help 
me, becaus e the s ur v iv ors ar e going bonk ers ,  
I need to arr est one, one f at her an d 
son who hav e bur ned a Nazi book st ore and 
you're going to get 
involv ed."  They 
weren't organized, so I got 
involved and from there and 
then we had this
 group, that 
I'v e c hair ed most of t h es e y e ars ,  I can't 
find a, a substitute, 
nobody wants it.  And 
they won't let me go.  An
d immediately _______________, 
every year now.   The n  
we built the, the memori
al, you know, that Holoca
ust memorial, and which 
________________  Gold man 
________________ and 
I chaired and others, but 
we wer e t h er e.  She was t h e c hair m an, I was,  I was t he f undr a
is ing chairman.  She 
was the artistic c
hairman, ________________  I was th
e overall chairman.  And 
then we, we build the...
 
Q: You're talk ing about the Ho loca
ust memorial in San Francis co?
 
A: And then the, t he George
 Segal( ph) piece.  And t h en 
we built,  bef or e that  ev en,  
we built the Holocaust library
 and research cent
er here.  And t hat
 was done while I 
was presid ent of the Bureau 
of Jewish Educ at ion, about 
that time.  But that was 
spearheaded by Max 
Garcia(ph), a Dutch Jew, a Sep
hardic Jew, is one of the few 
Sephar d ic Jews aliv e here f r om
 Holland.  My 
wife is Sephar dic ,  her fat h er' s f a mily . 
Originally, great-grandfather
 came from Ba g
hdad(ph), through En
gland, to Hon g  
Kong.  My wife was born in
 the Orient, all Sephardim. 
 
Q: Now when y o u say no
 one k new y ou wer e  a s urv ivor
, what about yo
ur  wife and  
your childr e n?
 
A: My wife knew a li
ttle, yeah we talked,
 but  she nev er as ked 
m e, she didn't want  
me to talk , cause she 
didn't want me to thin
k about it  and talk  
about it  and she tried 
not to have me see anything 
on television if  she could 
help it.  My children kne w 
because they did it  behind my
 back, they never asked me
 and one day, when they 
were in their middle teens, I remember it 
very vividly, I decided
 that I better tell 
thes e k i ds mor e than just what t hey hea
r, what t h ey read an
d what t h ey hav e  
extracted from me.  So I took them individu
ally, first one, then th
e other, in the car 
and we  drove up to the Sonom
a and I said, "Look, we  go
ing to, today we going to 
talk about,  I 'm going t o 
tell you a few things."  And they, 
unless, it felt  like, they said 
both and I didn't tell one fr
om the other, they 
both said independent
ly , they we ren't 
together, that I brought them 
s eparat e, "W e don't want to 
talk about it, we know all 
about it, we know, 
y o u don't hav e t o tell us any m or e
."  So they di
dn't wa nt and I  
think that was because my wife
 must have instilled that in 
them, they didn't want me 
to feel hurt and to think about it or 
talk about it, think 
about it, whatever.
 
Q: Relive it?
 

A: Huh ?
 
Q: To relive it?
 
A: Yes, they said, "We know, we, 
we checked everything out, I mean 
_______________, we've re
ad about it, but yo
u don't have to ta
lk about it."  So 
obviously now they're 36 and 
38 and we never ta
lk  about this.  My best friend, the 
one, m y friend Hans, who I 
t o ld you, he and I wer e in
 Auschwit z together and we 
were in W a rsaw t o gether an
d Dac hau t o get her, he would nev
er talk about it.  I tried 
to talk about it 
to him, is bec a us e I  want ed to pr ep
ar e my self f or my book.  I want ed,  
he would never, he says, "No 
reason talk  about it any mo
re."  He  would never talk 
about it, he would ne
v e r ta lk a b out  it.
 
Q: Did he hav e a 
family as well?
 
A: He never had children, s
he couldn't hav e c h ildr en, s
he had, they did experiments 
on her.  She di
ed bef ore he did. 
 
Q: How did you feel when th
ey said, we don't want to
 talk about it, when your 
childr en,  y o u were r ead
y to open up 
and they didn't 
want  to hear ?
 
A: I was a little disappointed 
and then I also felt that they
 were very pr
otective of 
me, so I dropped 
it.  They knew 
and they can read 
and they know.
 
Q: Would you do it the 
same over again, if
 you knew now that...
 
A: Yeah, probably.  Ye ah, I c
ouldn't change tha
t.  An d that's the reason I want, I'm 
wr it ing t h is book, s o they hav e
, so they can read 
it, but t hey, of c ourse if t h ey want  
to ask me, they 
could ask me, they neve
r ask me and th
at's  only  bec aus e t h ey want  
to pr ot ect me.  And m y gr andchildr en, who 
ar e s i x and eight, by 
t h e time t h ey hav e,  
by the time can co
mprehend life a litt
le bitter, better, 
_______________, I may not 
be her e.  So t hat
' s wh y  I wa nt t o p ut it in wr it in g.
 
Q: Well what about, what abou
t the interview that you 
did with the Holo caust 
mus e um, hav e t h ey seen that ?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Or read that?
 
A: No.
 
Q: You mean I know more about yo
ur life than your children do?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And your wife?
 

A: I don't know if  you know 
more, but they didn't read 
it.  I'm putting all, I'm 
com b in in g it a l l in t h er e, in my b o ok, n o
t, there's separa
te documents.  I had a oral 
hist or y tak e n bec aus e it's t h e 
cust om here in San Fr anc i sc
o t hat  the p ast pr es idents  
of the federation have
 their oral history taken.  An
d the one who took mine wa s the 
________________ for the fede
ration.  It's not finished 
yet, it 's finis
hed, but they 
haven't _____________
___ yet.  And they'll come out 
the next couple 
of months. 
They haven't read it, 
they haven't read
, I didn't want them 
to read the manuscript, 
not of the book, because I wa
nt to finish that, but they
 have not and 
the one from 
Washington, I must tell you, 
I have it in video 
and in wr it ing.  I 
don't even know why 
they wa nt, yeah I think 
I have it, I know wh ere it is now
.  I think it 's 
not so good and I 
thin k that _______________, almost thin
k it 's boring, 
but that's me.
 
Q: It's not boring.
 
A: It's not boring, I t
hought it  was very poor
ly done.  You've got 
more out of me than 
they have, I think, righ
t?  Smart.  Very smart.
 
Q: Well tell me this, 
how do you think it a
ffect ed you as a father, es pec i a l ly t h at you 
weren't telling them abo
ut it.  Ho w do you think hav
ing what you we nt through...
 
A: Well t h er e' s a r e as on f or t h is  and I' m go
ing to tell you the re
ason.  When I came 
to San Fr anc i sc o, I st ay ed 
with my aunt for a 
week, my aunt and un
cle, then I said, 
"I need an apartment."  How 
much, I had no money.  So 
I got a room in a basement 
on 25th and Anz a( p h) , whic
h cost eight dollars a m
onth and I had a bunk bed, 
whatever it 's called, a mattr
ess and a curtain and
 that was my si
de of the garage 
and t h e ot her side was  a car,
 left ev er y m orning at  s ev en.
  I don't even know who's 
it was, lived upstairs somewhere.  Bu
t I, I, I saved enough af
ter I got, I bought 
mys e lf a r adio f or fiv e dolla
rs. So I listened only to s
peaking, never 
to music.  
Anything speakin g to listen 
to the language, nigh
t after night, way in to the night. 
Damn flowers.  And so that
's how I learned the language a 
little bit and I wanted to 
be an Am er ic an.  I didn't want 
to live with my
 aunt's here and her 
sist ers.  They st ill 
spoke German and all thei
r friends.  I can speak Ge
rman, to continue that.
 
Q: This was, you were out 
of the village now, you w
anted to be somewhere else.
 
A: I want t o  get out of t her
e and I went t o t he 
Jewish community center and I joined. 
Was  12 dollars  a y e ar, but I c o
uldn't pay them 12 bucks, so
 I  wor k ed a deal with the 
gir l on t h e c ount er, I 
pay one dollar  a m o nth,  a month. 
 One dollar when I could pay, 
but I couldn't pay more.  So
 I want ed t o be an Am er ican, 
I looked up to this whole 
country and I still do, as 
much as I'm now complain
ing more than 
I did then, 
bec aus e of  our da
mn polit ic ians.
 
Q: But that's being Am eric an.
 

A: That's being Am erican.  So
 I,  I went to t he c ent er, 
aft er the f ir st y e ar being i n  
there, going to school, on we
ek ends went t o the cent er, 
then I went t o the c e nt er  
almost every night.  And wh
en y ou as k me about why  did he j oin the M as o n s, I  
want to be an Am er
ic an.  I went in To
astmasters Inte
rnational, I went, I joined, 
which was very hard 
for me, but I join
ed Toastmasters Internat
ional, later on, after 
55, I was in the j unior  cham ber
.  I wanted to be 
like, and I'm saying this over, is I 
want t o be lik e ev ery body else, I want t o 
have that, that part 
of life had to sto p  
bec aus e I couldn't f unction if I liv ed t h at life
.   I didn't want to 
think about it.  And I 
want ed to hav e my c h ildr en a normal 
lif e,  an Amer ican, s o c a lled Am er ic an, 
meaning a normal lif e.   I ' d be
en watching some of my fr
iends who were survivors, 
who m es s e d up their childr en 
no end, mess ed t h em up, psy chic,  psy c hiatr ic ally.  
That's all they ta

funct i on, t h os e k i ds.  T hey 're  not kids any m o

to be like
 that.  I 
wanted to be like same ____
____________ guy, like this la
dy is here, I wa nted to 
be an Am erican and I didn't 
want  my childr e n t o be aff e
cted by that. 
 Pardon my 
language, I shouldn't
 have used that
 word, but that's how I fe
lt about it, 
I was angry 
that t hey would, t h at t hey m es s e d up thei
r children and I didn't
 want that and I'm 
still, I still feel this  today.  
I still talk about t
oday and I watc
hed this.  They're either 
estranged from the children... 
 I have a couple I 
ran into recently 
that I hadn't seen 
for awhile, they mo
ved out of town.  I said , "How are 
your kids?"  "I 
don't know."  I 
said, "W hat  ar e y o u t a lking about ?"  T h es e 
were people in the ca
mps, I said, oh no, 
first I said, "You have
 grandc hildr e n?"  That 's  how 
I st art e d out, bec a us e you know,  
I lov e my grandc hildr e n, I hav e a gr eat t i
me with them.  They 
said,  "Oh, we never  
see our grandchildren."  I said, I said, "How
 c an you t a lk  lik e th
at Helga?"  I said, 
"What about your son?"  "We 
never see him."  I haven't,
 I talk ed about it  for one 
week to my wife, I said, "I
 can't belie ve them."  And 
these ar e nice pe ople, t h es e 
ar e not s l obs, t h es e are nic e
, decent, good citize

cc es sf ul, they 'r e 
ret ir ed.   And t h ey mes sed up t heir c h ildr en
.  And I was right, I di
dn't wa

that, I smelled it, I sa
w it in Holland right aft er t he war.
  I s a w the c liques and t hey s it  
there and ________________
  about how it  was in Au

Birkenau.  I said, I knew it
 already.  Now a lot of, so
me of the mo
re intelligent 
sur v iv or s didn't t a lk t o  ea
ch other about it and when 
t h e c o nv er sation c om e up ,  
there was nothing to, there 
was nothing to r em ember a
nd nothin g to commiserat e 
at t he m is e ry, bec aus e it would only perp
et uated, I want ed t o 
be lik e ev er y b ody  
else and I will tell
 you today, I succeeded 
to the point that my 
children are very, ver y  

normal, very successful, very smart, they
 have everything. 
 They're college

Q: And what did t hey  think 
when y o u st art ed gett ing in
volved with the Holocaust 
memorial here
 and the Ho locaust Museum nationally
 and that part of your life 
started expressing
 it s elf mor e ?
 
A: G o od quest ion.
 
Q: So...
 
A: Did m y c h ildr en, did my c h
ildr en and my wif e enc o ur age th
at ?  F ir st of all I didn't  
as k them.  Sec o nd of all, 
if I had as ked t h em , they 
would have said, "What do you 
need that  for?"  My wife more so than my
 children, most likel
y.  Most  likely I  
shouldn't say, because I know. 
 I did it anyhow because I, 
I wa s asked, I felt I owe 
and it  had to be done by 
someone who, who wa s willing 
to do it and, and, and had 
the connections nationally, was 
polit ic ally involv ed.  And ju
st as a matter of, I thin k 
that I couldn't walk away fr
om t his , sinc e I was as k ed. 
 And I was as ked loc a lly was  
mine, it was easy.  Nationa
lly it was much, much more, more a bigger commit ment. 
They were very prou
d of me.  They alwa
ys applauded it, my ch
ildren and 
my wife, 
but if I, if they had to 
make a decision for 
me, they would have
 says no, enough is  
enough.   Whic h I  t hink wa
s normal and I would have 
done the same in their 
pos it i on, becaus e t hey' r e v ery 
prot ect i ve of m e.  So that' s why I didn't as k them.  I  
didn't know that.  No w,  did they
 go to the openi
ng, of c ours e.
 
Q: And what happened that 
night and that week in
 your family 's life?
 
A: In the opening?  Well, I tell you, sinc
e Susan works with me here, she saw more 
what's going on and, but 
Da vid really, really took to this
, to a point t h at I c ould s ee it  
on his f a ce.   His wif e also we
nt of course and his wife and
 I are very close, she's a 
wonderful, wonderful gi
rl.  They unde
rstood it even better, 
they were 
very proud 
that they could see their fath
er 's name on the wall ther e,
 as one of the mar k ers, yo u 
know.  And, and maybe they didn't
 understand when 
I wa s ________________ 
there twic e a month for many years.  
________________ all 
about, caus
e was hard 
to understand fo
r anyone.  But when th
ey saw that, and 
Fern had been 
with me in 
Was h ington of cour s e , not of
ten, but you know, a few times.  On the way to Israel 
we stopped over th
ere, so she wa s 
with me.  And of course 
they, they unde
rstand it  
fully.  It was not that ther
e was any remorse or
 regret that they had not stopped me, 
to t h e contr ary,  it' s j us t  no
t discussed.  That's what he w
ant s t o do, t h at' s what he 
has to do, that's what he shoul
d do.  Oh yeah, and 
the kishkas(ph) in 
the, in the, in 
_______________, they know th
at it has to be done. 
 They're very, very, my 
daughter is more of a street 
person, like me.  Da vid is, ther
e's no gray with him, it 's 
white or blac k.  An
d he' s a ver y, v ery succ es sf ul
 s u rgeon, he' s  an ort h opedic  

surgeon here.  Very, he's a, 
he's a real star.  I can say 
that because people tell me 
that daily.  So he's on his 
own and so there's 
nothing, in retros
pect it's good and I 
know t h ey 'r e v er y pr oud of t h
at.  That's all but, did he ag
ree with me at times, no. 
Not that he said it, bu
t I could feel it.  My
 wife says, "God, yo
u're killing yourself, 
you're killing yourself, schleppi
ng(ph) there all the time," 
you know, flyi
ng back and 
forth.  What can I tell you?
 
Q: I have about five quest
ions at onc e her e.  F irst of al
l, how, did they ev er s ee yo ur  
tattoo growing up?
 
A: The children?  Yeah.
 
Q: What did they, how did you explain that to them?
 
A: Well, the early days I couldn't 
explain it  _______
_________ .  Ev en my 
granddaughter aske
d me not to long 
ago, what is that
?  Oh she said, "Is that your 
phone number?"  
Something like th
at, the little one, you se
e and I couldn't explain 
this t o a f i v e y e ar old, four y ear old, f iv e
 y e ar  old t h en m ay b e.  I s a id, "I ' l l tell y ou 
one of these days."  
My children?  Fern to
ld them, my wife told
 them, I'm posit iv e, 
because they didn't 
press the issue 
and I've never heard them
 say, that's, like, 
things like my father had 
a num b er on his arm, y ou s e
e, I nev er hear d t h em  say 
that.  Bec a us e it ' s pr iv at e.  
I tried to, I tried to
 wear long sleeves 
most  of the time, 
whic h I not i ce a lot of sur v iv or s do.  You 
don't want to,  exc e pt when I 'm in Ha wa i i  
where we go on the beach, or
 on the pool here, swim  ever
y morning, that you can't 
help it.  People are ve
ry respectful of it, to
 me at least  and the 
ones who as k ,  I wil l  
explain.  Non-Jews don't under
s t and, s om e  of t h em r eally
 don't know what it is. 
And then I explain it.  And Jews, if they
 have to ask me, t
hen there's somethin g 
wr ong with them, they should 
know.  And do I, I tried to 
play it down, that's why I 
don't wear short s l eev e shirt s in t he s umm
er  or in t h e winter. 
 So and the children 
never, they never made
 an issue of it.  I'm sure thei
r  m ot her  explained it  t o t h em  
because that's the protecti
on ________________ 
 they had.
 
Q: How did you m e et y our wife?
 
A: T h e m a n who hired m e also intr oduced me
 t o  my wif e.  That's Mr.  Albertson.  
They lived in the same bu
ilding together, they were
 friends, family friends.
 
Q: Here in...?
 
A: Here in San Francisco.
  He and my wi
fe's family, they
 were friends.
 
Q: Where was she while yo
u wer e in  th e ca mps ?
 
A: At, in San Fr anc is c o .  She went  to Lowe
ll High Sc hool and s
he went to St anford, 
when I was in the camps, kind of, you know
, she, s h e was bor n in t he Or ient, c am e  

to this, came back here before the war, par
ent s divorc ed.  She wa
s rais ed by aunts, 
two aunts, who were like paren
ts to me, she had two wond
erful aunts.  They also 
born in t h e Orient, t hey  spok
e Chinese fluently.  They we re
 born ther e, s o was t heir  
fat her.   T hey were 
Sephardic Jews who we re in bus
iness in Hong Ko
ng.  And my 
wif e was bor n t her e, so s h
e wa s here during the war, 
so was her fat h er, he h ad 
come back here
.  And they  wer e  in t h e im port
-export business in San Francisco, 
the offices in Hong Kong, Toky
o, Manilla.  So they didn't
 know much about, first of 
all, t h ey were Sephar dic J e
ws so they had no
, no relationship wi
th any Ashkenazim 
in Europe, so nobo
dy was killed, except 
my wife's, two of he
r aunts died in the  
Japanese concentration
 camps in Hong Ko
ng, because the Japane
se interned the 
Br it is h, they all had Brit ish 
passports.  So they  
died in the 
camp.  Not fo
r, not like  
the Germans, they di
ed t her e of, I don't k now if 
it was malnutrition or some 
dis e as es, but it was differ ent .  That' s t he 
only relat ionship they
 had with the war, 
caus e t h ey were Britis h subj ect s.
 
Q: Wer e you afraid f or her to 
find out when you 
first met her?  An
ything about your 
past ?
 
A: No, that didn't both
er me.  No, but I didn't make 
an is sue of it, I didn't make a n  
issue of it  because, like I said
 earlier, I didn't want
 to be like, 
I don't like to be around 
sur v iv or s.  They'r e v er y narr o w m i nded, at
 least  the gr oup her e
 in San Francisco, 
ot her s I k now in other  part s of t h e wor l d, 
ov er the y e ar s, but her e in San Fr anc i sc o 
it 's so, it 's not a, 
I don't enjoy this group at all, th
at's between us, 
maybe I shouldn't 
put it on tape.
 
Q: That's to be stricken from the record.
 
A: Yeah, but their ni
ce people and I, we go ou
t with some of t
hem, every so often 
we have t h em ov er, t h ey go 
to their house, to keep this 
relationship, but no, they're 
not, they don't think like I do
, meaning I don't want
 to live that life 
any more.  I want  
to live like th
e rest of, like everybod
y else in this town
, like 740,000 people.
 
Q: One t h ing y o u' re say ing that  k i nd of
 amazes me is that you say you go 
swim ming.
 
A: Ev er y m or nin g.
 
Q: Fr om the first interview, you said that
 you didn't, as  a c h ild
 you we ren't allowed 
to lear n t o s w im, bec ause of being a J e w.
 
A: Ah, and I lived in
 Germ any.  They took the kids
 swimming, you know, not every 
day, but y o u k now, once a m o nth, onc e a 
week, I forget.  Beca
us e I was t h e on l y  
Jewish c hild in t h e ent ire s c hool
 of  800 childr e n and t here's 
a, t here was a c it y poo l  
they us ed, on t h e out s kirts of town and I was ,
 I went in that pool 
once, I think it was 

in first grade, was in
 1932, or thereabouts
, in '33, then I coul
d never go in there 
again, they  let m e, I had t o s it on t h e s i
de, while, while all t
he other kids were 
swim ming.  And I was  the onl
y Jew there.  Couldn't hav
e really mess
ed up too 
badly, but there's an
ti-Semit ism.  And the head of 
the school wa s an anti-Semit e, 
my teacher was not, bu
t head of the school a was a Na zi
, so no, I never learned to 
swim until, until I was in th
e army.   I nev er had les sons, 
I just  taught my
self.  Now I 
can swim .

A: ...nobody else ever, no
body else ever asked me.
 
Q: Well, thank you 
for saying that.
 
A: You should just use your own judgment.
 
Q: W ell,  one t h ing,  as I 'm listening to y o u,
 talk  about being, how
 did you make your 
political decisions, wh en di
d you become polit ic al and 
how did you choose what 
political party to, 
oh wait.  How did you choose
 your polit ic al affiliation?
 
A: Well, as you know
 my wife will, will ta
ke, she would love to
 sit here
 now and 
explain it to you.  She keep
s on, my wife was a Republic
an when I met 
her.  I can't 
explain why, but she was.  
When I met her I wa
s a regist er, r egis t er ed Dem ocr at.  
Why?  Because the Jews in San Fr ancisco
 ar e all Democr at s, s o t hat  y o u know,  
you as k ar ound,  y o u r egist er, s o y ou r egist er 
like all the rest  of  the Jews, Democrat. 
Until, until, I think was ar
ound the Nixon, Nixon era, 
or there about and I became 
more conservative and definit
ely when the Reagan, I really
 did not get in volved in, 
in, in overt politics until Re
agan, national politic
s.  For some reas
on I got involved 
with the Reagan camp
aign here and I used to go
 and travel with Reagan in 
southern California to intr
oduce him to Jewish 
audiences, B'nai Br ith lodges and 
Temples and all this. 
 Bec a us e  mut ual f r iend was v e
r y c l os e t o hi

he as ked m e t o f l y down t h er

ry hard, I was 
a chairman for 
Reagan in San Francisco, 
________________  Jews
.  And I'm very conservativ e  
and apropos, the majo

sur v ivor s, now 
ev er ybody  thinks  t hey ' r e a s urv iv or, bu
t camp surv iv ors, ar e Republicans, ar e 
conservative.  It surprise
s ________________ 
 because the big
gest surpri
se when 
you talk to ______________
__ so-called, they say, "H
ow can you, how can you, a 
guy was in the camps, how can you be a Re
public an or be so co
nservative?"  It 
blows people's minds, I'm talking about Je ws, it blows their mind, cause I'm 
supposed to be a real bleedi
ng heart li beral,  you know, 
who gives everybody else' s  
money away, exc ept  their 
own.   And y ou see I 'm pr
ejudiced, r i ght ?  And I'm  
cons er v at iv e, bec a us e I had t o mak e it, I di
d.  When I was in t h e army, I m a de 72  
dollars and that's all I had and I bought a 
war bond of 18 dolla
rs and 75 cents, 
ev er y m ont h f or t w o y ears.  Did I hav e m o
ney left ov er ?  No,  be
cause I didn't have 
enough money because you k
now, I have to get, certain 
necessary things you have 
to buy.  I worked at nigh
t as a waiter on top of i
t, every night an
d Saturday and 
Sunday,  c a us e I 'm cons er vat i v e and I,  I be
liev e t h at y o u do it y ourself,  y o u help,  
obviously you know my life a little bit, pe
ople that need you, hel
p t h em.  T hat' s  why  
I'm involved so much wi
t h a l l th e  in st it ut io n s  her e.  B ut,  but, t h is, t h is lib er a lis m  to 
me, is pulling the country in
 the direct ion Rus s ia went .  
 Rus s i a is  a bask et c as e,  
they can never get out of this
, Russia is gone.  Th
ey can't pull out of this.  And, and 

I see, I see how we  _____
___________  the deter
ioration which starts with the 
economics and then it  goes in
t o the ment ality of people and 
t h e cr im e, it ' s  a l l p a r t o f  
this, this, this ultra- liber alism and I cannot
 stom ach this, I can't

wr ong,  y o u need t o be mor e cons ervat i v e, 
the liberalism is  not goi

t muc h and t heirs is wor k ing di
ff er ent ly, it ' s wor k ing bett er  
than ours.
 
Q: Why do you t h
in k t h at is ?
 
A: Cause they're contro
lling it differently, they don't 
let it get out of
 hand and t he 
gov er nment contr o ls it , so 
they don't let, they
, the s p ec ial int er est s  groups ,  who  
direct things without really having knowledg
e, for instance this, 
this, this thing thi s  
week about the trees up
 in, up north, a t
housand people demonstra
ted.  Two-thirds 
hav e nev er  been up ther e, t h
ey don't know anyt
hing about it, they
 saw dead trees 
and I think that sometimes yo
u hav e to help nat ur e.  T h
ey weren't destroying the 
whole thing.  Plus the fact, 
how many people are out of jo
bs there?   There's, the 
unemployment is unbelievable ther
e in that area.  Because th
at's all they had to live 
off, that industry.  Destroy it
?  They're destroying, they'r
e destroying  an industry, 
very simple .  Ca use, it's the eagle.  Th
ey don't care about thos
e God damn 
trees.  
Sure, I'm saying they should 
take all the trees down, but 
in an orderly fashion you 
can handle that, but no by 
saying, not negotiab
le.  The people on
 welfare becaus e 
of this.  And there must be
 a middle path.  You don't 
hav e t o  be on welfar e, 
everybody.  Healthy,
 workable people.  But there's no 
ot her industry  up t h er e.  I t  
happens constantly. 
 I can tell you that closing up th
e situation was chairman of the, 
he built  a wing, t h e new
 wing on the Jewish ho
me, he lost, we  had, 
________________  
certain glass, from PPG, larges
t company in the country.  We 
found out after we wer e wait
ing for deliv ery t hat the f act
ory c los ed up bec a us e, it  
was closed up because of, h
appened to be 
the union closed up th
at factory and we  
had to go t o Spain and buy 
that, that whole town was un
employed.  There's got to 
be a m i ddle pat h.  You 
see t h is, it goes too f a r.  No
w as a dictatorsh
ip, my side, no 
it 's no dictatorship.  Bu
t some people need, 
some people need 
guidance, but not 
the guidance of saying, we 'll wo
rry about you, just
 get out of bed in
 the morning, if  
you don't want to get up, we'l
l pay you anyhow.  That's wh
y, my kid's think I'm, my 
daughter is  a Democrat, my son 
is a Democrat, they think I'
m  At illa the Hu n.  They 
think I'm too far to the 
right, but I don't care.
 
Q: So what lies ah
ead for you, what do yo
u s e e ahead for  your self ?
 
A: For me?  Not much any 
more, you k now, I had s om e medic a l pr oblem s and t h is ,  
I'm going t hr ough t hat , s lowly I'm  gett ing 
much better, I'm almo
st back t o
 normal, 

but I, I  hav e a pac em ak er and I had s om e 
heart  pr oblems  and I,  I think I 'm ok ay  
with that.
 
Q: Is that part of what motivated you to wr it e the book?
 
A: No, but, no, no, what mo
tivated me was basically becaus e I was thinking about it 
mor e and I want m y gr andch
ildren to know where they ca
m e from, what t h ey, what  
they, who t heir  gr andf at her wa
s.  One of my ser i ous pr ob
lems I have 
and I thought 
about it yesterday, I don't k
n o w wh y it c am e to  my mind,
 that most people can go to 
a grandfather 
or to a relative and say, "What 
happened when 
I was a child?"  And 
I've no one to ask. 
 I don't know, I'd like
 to know more about 
my grandparents.  I 
know that I knew them, I know
 they lived there. 
 My father's sist
er, she disappeared, 
she died in Auschwit z, we don't know wher
e, how, what date.  My grandf at her die d ,  
was kill ed in Sobibór.  Bu
t I've no one to ask.  So
meone, any one y o u s e e ha s  
som eone t hey can as k, t her e's s om e r elat i
v e and I hav e no one.  That bot her s m e  
at times and it 's, it 's the link 
that I cannot repair.  So  at le
ast I feel that
 I got to pick 
up where I  remember .  I have no unc l es 
to ask, my cousins 
all young, I'm the 
oldest, so they don't 
know.  And I had one 
aunt and a first cous
in on my father's 
was still alive, she li ves in upstate 
New York.  And _______
_________ , I talk t o  
them regular, I'm very close to
 her children.  But 
I we nt to see, I ma
de a special trip, 
I took my tape recorder wi
th me, I said, "Sophi
e," her name is Sophi
e, Aunt Sophie, 
she's 97.  So
 I tried to get some
 out of her, I couldn't, she 
was too old.  Was too old, 
I went too late.  Becaus

And t hen, and I hav e 
a pict ur e of my fat h er, whic h is
 not a very go
od pictur e and I  
have only one picture of my
 sister and I found by ac
cident, the neighbors had it  
when she was maybe 10 
years old, I don't think she was 
12, I don't know.  So that' s  
the only pic t ur e I  have of m y 
sist er .  And t h at link I m i ss,  
that I can't, 
I have no one 
to ask.  
 

Q: I know, I think abou
t  that f or y o u, of all t hos
e events you've
 lived through.
 
A: I think, I think about it very often, 
that my mother, would she enjoy seeing my 
childr en,  m y grandc h ildr en.   Of cour se lif e
, life stops even in
 normal times, but 
wouldn't she like to see my success?  Yo
u k now, c ould s he ev er dr eam that I would 
be what I am?  I' m k nown wor l dwide, I don
' t  mean t o impr es s y o u, I m ean I  hav e 
friends all ov er t h e wor ld be
c ause of m y J e wis h act i v it i es and, not s o m uc h  the  
museum, that too, in this country.  My su
ccess, I have no need 
for money, I've got it 
all, two houses.  What else
 c an a guy ask f o r?  I got a gr eat f am i ly .  An d I, and I  
thin k of very often, 
my father and mother, if they co
uld only see th
is, cause they, 
they wer e ver y em ot ional, es pecially my
 mot her and s o was my gr and m ot her . 
They cried when somebody ha
d a baby t h ey  cr ied, t h ey
 crie d for everything, you  
know how the Jews ____________
____ ?  But that would be
, that would be a great 
thing which, under normal c
onditions that wouldn't have 
been alive with my great 
grandchildren are, c
hances are because they
, they died in 1943, 
they were killed in 
43 when they  were 46 years  old.  
 So,  tak e  y our  numbers  I mean,  
________________  the 
chances they would know 
more than grandchildren, 
minimum, they were 
in their late 20's. 
 ________________ my wife
 and I married, I 
was 31, I was 31, she was 
30.  So, that luck only
 ________________  people who 
marry very young and 
stay together, right?
 
Q: The odds of that are slim.
 
A: Oh yeah, chances ar
e.  But I would have, 
I think about it
 frequently, no
t often, but 
frequently.  _____
____________, my mother could only see.
 
Q: It's ir onic that being Jewish
 br ought  y o u t h e wors t par t s 
of your life and the best 
parts of your lif e.
 
A: Yeah.  I don't think it 
was J e wis h, c o uld be yeah, be
c a us e of the cam p s, but th e 
Chr ist ians went t o t he cam ps t oo, a few.  
And look what it did 
to the Russians.  I 
saw thousands of Russians bei
ng k illed, in fr ont of us
 in Ausc hwitz and ot her  
camps.  They killed them.  Pu
t them in ic e water, big pool
s of ice water.  It wa sn't 
only the, it was the Jews or the Gy
psie s, they did it to the Gypsie s.
