Manny Mandel was  born to a religious  J ewis h family on May
 
8th, 1936 in Riga, 
Latvia.  Manny was  jus t 3 when World War II started in 1939.  Although he was  born in 

Riga, Latvia, Manny's family were Hungarian J ews .  They had moved briefly to Latvia 

2  
bec aus e of his  father's  work.  Here we see a portrait of Manny's  parents , Yehuda and Ella 
Mandel holding their infant s on Manny.
 
Shortly after Manny's  birth his  father ac c ept add pos t as  a c hief c antor in 
Budapes t and the family returned to hungry where they liv ed in 1933.  Hungary is  

highlighted on this  map and Budapes t is  highlighted in y ellow.  Manny father was  bas ed it 

at the renowned Rombac h Synagogue.  In this pic ture we s ee Manny and his  father on a 

s treet in Budapes t.  The Hungarian government pass ed anti
-Je
wish laws  beginning in 
1938.  In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis  Alliance and in 1941 Hungarian troops  joined in 

the inv as ion of the Soviet Union.  The war, an inc reas ing res tric tions , made for lives  in 

J ews  in Hungary inc reas ingly difficult.  The photo on the left shows Manny outside his 

apartment on his  firs t day of s c hool in 1942 in Budapes t.  On the right, we s ee a 
c ontemporary photo of Manny s tanding outs ide the s ame apartment.
 
German forc es oc c upied Hungary in Marc h, 1944.  Manny and his  mother Ella 
wer
e fortunate to be inc luded in a program in whic h Jews  would be trans ported to 
Pales tine in exchange for truc k s .  Within months , they were trans ported by the Nazis  to 

the Bergen
-
Belsen c oncentration c amp near Hannover, Germany in preparation for the 
ev ent ac tual departure from Europe.  This  is  a historical photo of Bergen
-
Bels en.
 
Negotiations  for their trans port to Pales tine broke down and in Dec ember
 
1944, 
about s ix months  before the end of the war, Manny and his  mother were releas ed from the 
Bergen
-
Belsen 
c amp and trans ported to s afety in neutral Switzerland.  There they s tayed 
at the Heiden Children's Home pic tured here where Ella work ed as  a teac her.  Manny is  
ly ing down in the front on your left and his  mother Ella is  s tanding in the bac k  in the 

middle.
 
After the war, Manny and his  mother reunited with his  father in Is rael.  They 
s ubsequently immigrated to the United
 
States  and lived in Philadelphia.  Manny is  a 
graduate of Temple Univers ity and did his graduate work  at the Univ ers ity of 

Pennsylvania.  He
 
is  a c linic al s oc ial worker.  He met his future wife Adrienne in 
Philadelphia and they were married in 1958.  They hav e been married 58
 
years .
 
After work ing for the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization in Cleveland and in 
Mic higan, Manny and Adrienne moved to Washington, D.C. where Manny became the 

national program direc tor for B'nai B'rith Youth Organization.  He would later go to work  for 
the Peac e Corps  before beginning his  own psychotherapy prac tic e in 1980.  Manny retired 
from his prac tic e in 2014.  Adrienne's  many ac c omplis hments  inc lude hav ing s erved in the 

Maryland Legis lature as an elec ted member of the Hous e of Delegates .  She is  the 

immediate past

pres ident of theWas hington s uburban san a tear c ommis s ion, the nation's  
eighth larges t water and was tewater utility.  Adrienne retired from the water authority jus t 

in 2014.
 
I might als o mention Adrienne for many years  on the board of direc tors  for the

Person" Mr.
 
Manny Mandel.
 
(applaus e) 
 
>> Bill Bens on: Manny, thank s  s o muc h
 -- 
thank s  s o muc h for joining us and for being 
willing to be our "Firs t Pers on" today.  I k now y ou hav e got a busy week.  You're s peaking 
again here at the mus eum tomorrow, I unders tand.  You hav e s o much to s hare with us  
and a limited time, s o we'll get right to it.
 
You were born in Riga, Latvia, as  I mentioned earlier, in 1936 but your family 
s tayed there and c ertainly yours was  a s hort one before you moved to Budapes t.  War 
beg
an in Europe when Germany inv aded Poland in September
 
1939 when you were jus t 
3 
years  old.
 
Let's  s tart first with you telling us  a little bit about your family, your parents , and 
your life before the war, before the Holoc aus t began.
 
>> Manny Mandel: You need to k now that there is  s omething unique about Hungary, not 
us , but Hungary and the Nazi government.  You need to k now if you don't k now that only 

two c ountries  in Europe, bas ic ally, were in a different s ituation than all the others .  

Spec ific ally Hungary
 
was  an Ally was  Germany.  As  a c ons equenc e, the Jewis h 
c ommunity of Hungary had a different experienc e than the J ewis h c ommunity of Poland, a 

very s ignific ant differenc e in that we did not have any oc c upation by Germans .  The 

Germans  don't arrive in Hungary, in pres enc e, in pers on, until 1944.  And you k now how 

late in the war that is  bec aus e the war ends  in 1945.
 
So for the firs t years  of the war, from 1938, '39
 
through the early '40s , our 
diffic ulties  c ome not s o much from the Nazis  but from the war its elf.  Bombings  every time.  

Other k inds  of things .  And c ertain res tric tions  that the government, in fac t, was  able to 

manipulate.  We were under the rule of the Hungarian Naz i Party but that's  different than 
being under the rule of the German Nazi party.  So our ex perienc e is  war related more s o 
than Holoc aus t related.
 
>> Bill Bens on: But in that s hort period beginning in Marc h
 
1944, it was  an extraordinarily 
horrific  time.  And we'll turn to that.
 
So your family life and your family before the war, you told me a s ignificant s tory 
that your mother s hared with you along the lines of s omeone s aying one day, well, today 

you now s peak  Yugos lavian.  What was  s ignific ant about that?
 

>> Manny Mandel: That's  before my time.  That's  really after the Firs t World War. 
 
After 
the Firs t World War, Hungary is  trunc ated and some of it bec omes  Yugos lavia, s ome of it 

bec omes  Czec hos lovakia.  My mother was raised in the Hungarian part.  She was a 

s c hool k id, maybe 10
 
y ears  old or third grade.  And that's  when the war ended, Fi
rst World 
War, 1919 or s o.  And one day the teac her c omes  in and s ays , when you c ome bac k  to 
s c hool next Monday, we're going to switc h language.  We have been teac hing y ou in 
Hungarian to Serbo
-
Croatian.  It has  as  muc h in c ommon as  the moon and earth.  Bu
t 

4  
they were bilingual.  There was  no problem in that situation.  But Yugos lav ia was  c reated 
s o let's  us e the Yugos lav language which was  Serbo
-
Croatian.  My mother's  family, 

brothers  and s is ters  and parents , maintained Hungarian in the home.  But in s c hool
, it 
was , in fac t, in Serbo
-
Croatian whic h I don't s peak .  I probably k now s ix words .  At one 

time I may have k nown 20.
 
>> Bill Bens on: Manny, your father was  an important c antor in Budapes t.  Tell us  how he 

got to that pos ition.
 
>> Manny Mandel: My father
 -- 
well, the s horter vers ion is  the fact that my father at s ome 
point after s erving in the Czec h Army, he was  drafted bec aus e this  is  not Czec hos lovak ia.  

He was  able to get to Vienna.  My father was  able to get in a c antor s c hool which was  

world renowned
 
at the time in Vienna.  When he graduated from that s chool, he wanted to 
have a job in Hungary with his  hopes  being a cantor in Budapes t.  For thos e of you who 

don't k now, the c antor in the J ewis h c ommunity is  one who leads  the s ervices  and there's  

lots  of mus ic involv es  and c hoirs  involved and s o forth.
 
My father wanted to, in fac t, be in Budapes t whic h is  to him the New
 York 
Yank ees  of The Metropolitan opera of the c antores .  He was  unable to get work ing papers  

in Budapes t bec aus e he had been a Cz ec h c itizen having s erv ed in the Czech Army.  Not 

by his  own c hoice.
 
So he look ed around Europe and he was  able to find a very interes ting and v ery 
important pos ition in Riga.  We have no Latvian c onnec tion or family.  We k now nobody in 

Latvia.  At leas t I didn't .  And they were then ready to c ome bac k  to Budapes t bec aus e he 

did get an appointment in Budapes t in 1936.  They waited for me to arriv e.  As  s oon as I 

arriv ed, within week s , we moved to Budapes t.  I can tell you that my father
 -- 
s ome years  
ago when my f
ather was  s till alive, my wife and I went to Riga for a week end vis it to s ee it.  
It's  a nic e plac e.  My father s aid to me, look  up "pos t iela s eı i."  That's  Pos t Street 6.  That 

was  their addres s .  That was  the only Latvian he k new.  We vis ited the buildi ng, and it was  

and enjoyable weekend.
 
>> Bill Bens on: His  father in his  journey to coming the c antor in Budapes t, there were 

s ome important dec is ion points  that he had earlier in his  life.  One of them was  when he 

was  in the Army, the Army wanted him to s i
ng for them.
 
>> Manny Mandel: One of my favorite kind of warm, k ind of fuzz y s tories , my father 
drafted into the Czec h Army.  Now, the Cz ec h Army, as  many Armies , don't have various 
mus ic al k ind of things .  It was  s ome k ind of annivers ary of the Czec h s omething.  So they 

put on an opera.  For thos e of you k now anything about the Bohemian c ompos er, Bedric h 

Smetana, he wrote the opera c alled Prodaná Neves ta, The Bartered Bride.  They wanted 
my father to s ing the lead.  My father c ould not read mus ic .  He had nev er s een an opera.  
He was  able to be c oached lik e a trained ape of sorts , and he did reas onably well.
 
Based on that ex perienc e, the c ommanding mus ic ian of the whatever sugges ted 
that they have a deal for him.  The deal is, after his  Army s ervice, which they will c ut a little 
s hort if he is  ac c eptable and if it's ac c eptable to him to s end him to Prague to a 
c ons ervatory to s tudy mus ic  and to s tudy voice to become an opera s inger.  My father 

didn't k now what to do.
 
He c ouldn't approac h his  father with this
 
k ind of a ques tion.  He was  reluc tant.  
So he c alled on his  unc le, my grandmother's  brother who was  a lawy er.  And he c alled the 

unc le who was  k ind of the c onc iliatory of the family to talk  to his  father.  And the 

5  
unc le
 -- 
my great unc le goes  to talk  to his  brother
-
in
-
law and they had a c onv ers ation.  
And c omes  bac k  to my father and s ays , this  is  what your father s aid.  You hav e to 
unders tand where they're living and what the bac k ground is , very religious  family.  I never 
k new my grandfather.  He died years  before I was  born of smok ing.
 
But in any c as e, he says , I have s even c hildren.  If my s on Yehuda goes  to s ing 
in the opera and v iolates  the Sabbath and things  of that nature, I will have s ix c hildren.  
Thus  ended my father's  opera c areer.
 
And the other
 -- 
thos e of you that k now opera, he would hav e been a perfectly 
good tenor.
 
>> Bill Bens on: One of the other dec is ion points , as  I rec all, Manny, is  that he had 

opportunities  to be a cantor elsewhere inc luding, I think , London, other plac es  than 
Hungary.  Did he ever later expres s  in light of what happened to the family, did he ever 
ex pres s  regret about not having tak en one of thos e pos itions?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Yes  and no.  He did not expres s  any k ind of res entment upon not 

tak ing a pos ition bec aus e his  goal
 
in life was  to be in Budapes t.  And the other s ide of the 
c oin is  he s aid, had I tak en the pos ition in London, we would have esc aped the Holoc aus t.  

Interes ting where he was , in thos e days  people went on v arious  k inds  of
 -- 
what they c all 
probers .  They were auditions .  One was  in the duk e's  plac e s y nagogue in London which 

was  bombed during the war.  If he would have tak en that, perhaps  other members  of the 
family, would have been avoided during the Holoc aus t.
 
>> Bill Bens on: As  you said to us  earlier the full forc e of the Holoc aus t and war did not hit 
your c ommunity in Hungary until the s pring of 1944, there were s till many diffic ulties  for 

you onc e the war was  underway in Europe, beginning in fall 1939.  Tell us  about the 
c irc ums tanc es  of your family and what you may recall yours elf being as  young as  you 
were from thos e firs t few years of the war, before it really c ame to Hungary.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Becaus e I was  as  young as I was  and bec aus e of the c irc ums tanc es  in 

whic h we liv ed, I des c ribed the fac t that I lived very muc h in a bubble.  I was  well
-
protec ted 
from muc h of this .  I k new about many things.  I rec all them.  I can des c ribe them.  I did 

not get the impac t of the effect that I would hav e, had I been five or eight years  older.  If I 

had been five or
 
eight y ears  older, c hanc es  are I wouldn't be.
 
But I was  very well
-
protec ted but I s aw things .  I was  v ery s urpris ed and k ind of 
ups et in a way that when we s aw the Hungarian s oldiers  on the s treet and k new they were 

Allies  with the Germans  my parents  were
 
ups et with that.  I c ould unders tand that.  I 
unders tand this  is  a 5 and 6
-
y ear
-
old talk ing.  I don't k now why you root for a hometown.  I 
don't k now if you folk s  are from Was hington.  But the football team from your home 
c ommunity is  the one y ou root for.  In Was hington we don't root for Dallas .  We root for 
Was hington.  
 
(laughter).
 
I didn't unders tand why my parents  were rooting not for the loc al team but for the 
Allies .  That's  diffic ult for a kid to unders tand after k nowing loc al heros .
 
Other things  began to happen.  The Hungarian Numerus  Claus us  which were 
the res tric ted laws  were pas s ed in the '20s , not the '30s .  You may k now that the '30s  the 

German Nuremberg laws  c ame out.  But Hungarian laws  were pas s ed in the '20s  after 
Firs t World War but not r
eally enforc ed until muc h later, maybe 10, 12
 
y ears  later in the 
late '30s .
 

6  
So as  a c ons equenc e of that, from 1940 or s o, my father was  c ons c ripted into 
the labor battalions .  Hungarian men were drafted into the Army and fought in Rus s ia.  
Hungarian J ews  were not drafted into the Army but into labor battalions  to bac k fill thos e 
pos itions  that Hungarian men had, which had to do with s ome farming and s ome mining 
and railroad repair and road repair.  And my father was  perhaps  like a trav eling s ales man.  

After 
a while it was  normal for him not to be home.
 
But from '42
 
to '44, I s aw him infrequently.  I did s ee him but infrequently.  We 
would get a c all or a vis it or a letter that s aid on Tues day at 3:00, he will be at s uc h and 

s uc h a railroad s tation to be gone for a day, a week , or an indeterminant period of time.  

He would be out for a week , home for a week , out for a day.  Always  in Hungary.  It's  not 

really that big.  Any where a c ouple of hours  by train.  So I had very limited c ontac t with 
him at that time.
 
>
> Bill Benson: Tell us  what the Arrow Cros s  was .
 
>> Manny Mandel: The Arrow Cross  is  the s ymbol, c ros s ed arrows , is  a s ymbol as  
oppos ed to the swas tika, is  the s ymbol of the Hungarian political party.  In Germane it was  
a politic al party that had heav y impac t on the Army and the gov ernment.  In Hungary, it 
wasn't s uc h an Army.  It had les s  impac t.  It was a ruling philos ophy of an anti
-
Semitic  
nature.
 
>> Bill Bens on: And the anti
-
Semitism began to inc reas e and more and more restric tions 
were impos ed on Jews, what were s ome of the res tric tions  you recall?
 
>> Manny Mandel: The res trictions  on a k id were very limited.  Let me say it in two parts .  

Part one would be the air raid that happened onc e, twic e, three times a night, were a 

major impac t.  Even I c ould unders tand the next morning when I go to s c hool, the building 
next door to me may be gone.  There was  s ignific ant damage in Budapes t.  It was  bombed 
early by the Rus s ians  and later by the Allies  c oming from two direc tions .
 
But most of the other things  did not have impac t on me s pec ific ally, for ex ample, 
the res tric tions  in jobs , res tric tions  in s ome travel, res tric tions  in whic h you c ould and 
c ouldn't s hop, but I didn't do the s hopping s o I would not hav e been bothered by that in 
any direc t s ens e.
 
>> Bill Be
ns on: You told me, I thought, a very poignant s tory in that as  a k id, lik e any k id, 
you wanted a bicyc le but your father wouldn't let you hav e one.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Well, I had a trike, lik e an ov ergrown tricyc le.  My father s aid there 

were two reas ons  he bloc k ed the pos s ibility.  One I will handle, one I will not.  What I c an 

handle is  what I s aid, I lived in an apartment building on the fifth floor whic h was  50
 years 

old.  It had an elev ator which was  also 50
 
y ears  old.  And on many oc c as ions , that 
elevat
or had parts  that would break  down and the parts  that were to replac e them were 
manufac tured in factories  that would do ammunition and guns  and s tuff.  And elev ator 

parts  for my building were k ind of low on the priority lis t.  So it was  out of s ervic e perh
aps  

as  muc h as it was  in s ervic e.
 
When we had to go to air raid s helters  every night, five s tories  down, five s tories  
up.  I c ould not c arry a bik e five s tories  down bec aus e in Europe y ou ride in the park, not 

in the bac k y ard which y ou don't have.  He was a s trong gentleman in his  30s  s o he would 

truc k  the bik e down and bac k  up.
 
But there was  a s ec ond problem.  All of us , one of the res trictions  was  we wore 
a Yellow Star to be identified.  I thought the s tar was  a major mark of heroism bec aus e 

7  
after all, I 
was  6
 
years  old or 7 and I wore a s tar jus t lik e the adults  did.  I then dis c overed 
that it was  true this  bic y c le ex perienc e I began to dis c over that this  was  not s o muc h a 
mark  of heroism but a target that c ould be attac k ed in s ome way.
 
My father s aid to me, if we go to the park  and you ride the bike with the Yellow 
Star and you are out of my s ight, s omeone might have the notion
 -- 
bec aus e it happened 
in other plac e
 -- 
to whack  you on the head.  Not to s teal the bike, they don't want the bik e, 
jus t bec ause
 
you are a target and it's  open s eason on thes e k inds  of things .  And for that 
reas on, y ou don't hav e a bik e.  I was  very ups et by that.
 
But you have to unders tand that this  herois m notion of the Yellow Star to identify 
me as  a J ew was  not a mark  of heroism but a mark  of targeting for pos s ible mayhem.  

That was  a partic ular ex perience that began me to teac h what was  going on.  I can add 
when we c ame to this  country in 1949, I was  13
 
years  old.  And one of the very firs t things 
my parents  did when I c ame home from s c hool one day, they s aid we are going to the 
department s tore, s omething we don't have any more.  What are we going to buy ?  A 

bic ycle.  So I had
 -- 
and I treas ured that bic ycle.  I think  it lived with my in my bedroom, I 
polis hed it four times  a year.  It was  a Sc hwinn for thos e of you old enough to remember 

Sc hwinn bicycles .
 
>> Bill Bens on: Do y ou remember going to s c hool?  What was  s c hool lik e?
 
>> Manny Mandel: I went to a paroc hial s c hool, a J ewish day s c hool whic h happened to 
be three or four bl
oc k s  from my hous e.
 
My apartment was  on the c orner of two s treets , this  one and this  one.  And my 
parent's  bedroom was  on the c orner.  From the bedroom, you c ould s ee the sc hool.  
Maybe four bloc k s  away, three bloc k s  away.  Yet, I'm told on many oc c as ions ,
 
perhaps 
ev ery day, s omebody would follow me to s c hool bec aus e that Yellow Star in first grade 

was  an abs olute invitation to be whac k ed on the head.  Again, they are not going to rob 

me of my money or my wallet or my driv er's  lic ens e.  But they were going 
to whac k  me on 

the head becaus e it was  open s eas on on that k ind of mayhem.  And it did happen, not to 
me but it did happen.
 
>> Bill Bens on: In Dec ember
 
1941, your family had a truly horrifying ex perience while y ou 
were v is iting your aunt in another c ity.  Tell us  about that.
 
>> Manny Mandel: That was  my very firs t experienc e beginning to unders tand partic ularly 

in rec ollec tion what this  was  all about.  I'm 5
 
1/2 years  old in the winter of '41.  As  I s aid to 
you, my mother grew up in northern Yugos lavia whic h was  s outhern Hungary.  And my 
grandparents  and aunts  lived there.  My mother had two sis ters  and three brothers  but 

they were no longer living there.
 
In any c as e, we go down to a city c alled Nov i Sad, in thos e days  many cities  had 
multiple names  bec aus e it depends  on whic h country they belonged in in a c ertain time.  

Nov i Sad is  a Serbian name.
 
We go there by train.  It's  about 3, 3
 
1/2 hours  s outh of Budapes t by train.  We 
s tay at my aunt's  hous e.  My mother's  younger s is ter.  It's  very nic e.  I don't remember 

ex ac tly what we did.  But I do rec all that my aunt's  hus band had a c ook  fac tory.  I was  

tak en to the fac tory to be giv en a tour.  I was  interes ted to s ee what k ind of produc ts  they 

mak e out of c ork .  I'm not s ure it's  s ignific ant.  My unc le died
 
and the fac tory went.
 
One morning, perhaps  three days  after we were there, s omebody comes up the 
s tairs  and s ays  there's  s omething going on in the s treet.  Polic eman come up and s ay 

8  
k noc k , k noc k , ladies  and gentlemen, you need to dres s warmly bec ause you have to be 
outs ide.  We have to do a c ens us .  Now, it's  winter.  It's  not bitter but it's winter and it's  

c old.  The Germans  or the Hungarians, but the ruling government, was  going to count 
Jews every 20
 
minutes , I think .  Now a c ens us  in this  c ountry they
 
did every ten y ears .  
There they did with great frequenc y, on the as sumption, perhaps  a c orrec t one, if you 
c ount people and k now where they are, you c an c ontrol their movement and what they do 

and where they are.
 
So we were to c ome outs ide, my mother, my
 
father, my aunt and we were on 
the s treet on the sidewalk.  We were told to turn left and s tart walk  c an in that direc tion.  

We had no idea why.  We walk ed for s ome time, a c ouple, three hours maybe.  I k now my 

mother c arried me, my father c arried me and 
I als o walk ed.  I was  5
 
1/2 years old.  I was  a 
little guy.
 
We walk ed to a plac e I rec ogniz ed.  On our left
 
--
 
on our right was  the major 
s treet, and on the left was  an 8
-
foot stoc k ing fenc e.  Now, for thos e of you who may have 

been in Europe and you may know this , European c ities  whic h are not on the oc ean or a 
big lak e us e riv ers  to mak e beac hes  out of them in the summertime.  This  c ity is  on the 
Danube River, s outh of Budapes t.  It flows  from Germany into the Blac k  Sea through 

Budapes t and Yugos lav ia.
 
I 
remember the plac e bec aus e that s ummer, perhaps  two months  or three 
months  before, I had been there.  And ins ide the fenc e, about 300
 
yards  away from the 
fenc e, are hot pools  and c old pools  and wave pools  and res taurants  and amus ement 

parks.  A very nice p
lace in the s ummertime.  This  is  Dec ember.  The plac e is  s hut down 
bec aus e this  is
 -- 
you k now, this  is not beach weather.
 
As  we are all marc hing, k ind of walk ing s lowly, my grandparents  had arrived.  
Somebody brought them by truc k .  And we were huddled together perhaps  a dozen 

people or s o and we were walk ing s lowly in this  direc tion.  Again, in the direc tion
 -- 
and we 
notice the gates  to this  plac e turn in towards  the river.  We s till have no idea what's  going 
on.
 
There's  s ome nois e whic h was  very identifiable, we didn't k now it.  As  we get 
s omewhat c los er
 -- 
I don't k now how far we were at this  point, 50
 
feet, 100
 
yards .  A 
policeman is  s tanding on the right and he s ays  to my father, mister, what are you doing 

here?  He s ays  I'm here with my family.  He said, that's  not the point.
 
The point is  that I know that you don't live here.  You liv e in Budapes t and I k now 
that bec aus e I'm a foot patrolman in your dis tric t.  And I have s een you on the s treet any 
number of times  s o I k now that you liv e there.  So being here and being c ounted in this  
c rowd would mes s  up the numbers .  Can't do that.  Step as ide.
 
My father and my mother and our little group s teps  as ide.  I'm s ure it was  a 
matter of abs olute c oincidenc e.  As  we are s tepping aside, a minute or two later, literally a 
minute to two, the s taff c omes  down the road, a uniformed s oldier c omes  out, has  a 
pow
-
wow with his  patrolmen and s ays the requirement of the c ens us  has been met.  
There is a s c hool over there and you are welc ome to get hot c hoc olate or c offee and go 
home.  If you are bewildered, c an you imagine how bewildered we were.  We go home to 

my aunt's  hous e.  No idea what happened.  The phone c alls  start to c ome in.  We had 
phones .  My aunt calls  and s he says  where were you, we had plans .  We tell her.
 
T
he polic eman c omes to the door and s aid I would do a c ens us .  I would do 

9  
what I would normally do.  My aunt inv ited them in and gave them c offee and c ak e.  17 
c ak es , 19 c offees, and they had the bes t break fas t c offee in their life.  They as k ed three 

ques ti
ons  and they left.  And my aunt s aid, what's  going on?  I didn't go to the beac h.  I 
didn't go to the s toc k ade fenc e.  The experience of thos e people if I had made that left turn 

was  a muc h more horrible one.
 
The gov ernment, in fac t, took  c anon with whic h they c rac k ed the ice in the 
Danube whic h was  yay thic k .  All thos e who, in fact, made a left turn were shot into the 
river, never to be found again or if they were found, they were found floating underneath 
the ic e in Belgrade about an hour away the next Marc h or whenev er the river thawed out.  

This  is  a Pogrom, a sens eles s , us eles s , valueles s  experienc e that people c an do bec aus e 

they c an do it and you c an't s top them.
 
Something that happened
 -- 
this  was  retribution for that.  And 350 people were 
k illed in
 
the Pogrom of Nov i Sad of 1941.  I didn't quite unders tand what that meant but I 
c an des c ribe the s tory I jus t did.
 
The next morning, I only tell you about bec ause this  is  s omething I do remember 
and meaning to me.  My father c alls  for a taxi to go bac k  to Budapes t.  Somehow, folk s , 

when there is a c atas trophe around you, what y ou want to do is  go home.  My 

grandparents  with my aunts , I was  perfec tly s afe but this  was  not home.  Home was  in 

Budapes t.
 
My father c alls  for a taxi and a one hors e
-
power taxi s hows  up.  Can you gues s  
what that would be?  My daughter.  She is  c heating.  A one hors e
-
power taxi is  a s leigh.  

There's s now on the ground.  The regular taxis had engines in them as well.  But this  is  

what s howed up and that's  what I remember bec ause, again, for 5
 
1/2
-
year
-
old that's  an 
adventure.  350 people k illed does n't hav e that muc h meaning but a s leigh
 -- 
a 
hors e
-
drawn sleigh to go to the train s tation is  an adv enture.
 
>> Bill Bens on: Manny, I'm going to have us  jump now more than two years  to Marc h
 
1944 
when Germany oc c upied Hungary and, of c ours e, things  c hanged profoundly, 
dramatic ally, and almost ins tantly.  Tell us  what brought the Germans  in at that stage 
bec aus e they hadn't occ upied Hungary up until that point and then what happened from 

there
. 

>> Manny Mandel: In 1942 in Berlin, in a plac e c alled Wanns ee, there was  a c onferenc e 
c alled by the c hief SS offic er, a general in the Eas tern Front of the German war.  He c alled 
for a c onferenc e where they c ame up with the partic ulars for the final s olution to the 

J ewis h problem.  It's  a phras e that you s hould k now.  Obv iously the final s olution was  

extermination.
 
They appointed a man to be the pers on who, in fact, run this  is projec t, this  
is sue.  His  name was  Adolf Eic hmann.  Some of you may k now the name.  I'll get to s ome 

s tories  about him a little bit later.  But Eic hmann, in fac t, did a very effective job.  He is  a 

midlevel offic er in the Army, lieutenant c olonel.  And he, in fac t, cleared the J ews  from all 
of the c ountries  of Europe and s ends  him to various  extermination and c onc entration 
c amps .  You k now s ome of the names  of Aus chwitz, Birk enau and s o forth.
 
Sinc e Hungary is  an Ally of Germany, he does  not c ome to Hungary.  He c omes  
to Hungary
 -- 
well, doesn't c ome then.  He c omes  to Hungary las t. 
 
Now, '44, Marc h of 
'44
 
is  v ery, very late in the war.  You remember the D Day is  J une of '44.  The war is  over 
in May
 
of '45.  So this is if you want to talk in terms of, again, football c ontext, this  is  fourth 

10
  
quarter.
 
He c omes  to Budapes t on the 19th of
 
Marc h, 1944.  And the s ignific anc e there 
inc identally is the fac t that today I as ked the people in the mus eum why they as k ed me to 
do "Firs t Pers on" today.  They s aid bec aus e the 17th of Marc h today is  not reminis c ent to 
Saint Patty's  Day, it's  reminis c en
t that the Germans  c ame to Budapes t where I was  on the 
17th.
 
But in any c as e on the 19th of Marc h, Eic hmann arriv es .  As  s oon as  he 
arrives -- 
I mean, as  s oon as  s ome is s ues  happen, the deportation from Budapes t begin at 
the rate of 12,000 a day .  Now, I don't k now where you folk s  are from, but als o when I 

s peak  to groups  I find people from smaller communities  where 12,000 repres ents  the 

whole c ity or the whole town or repres ents  their s c hool.  And that was  the s ize of the 
deportation beginning immediately within days of the 19th of Marc h, 1944.
 
>> Bill Bens on: What happened to y our family when Eic hmann arrived?  Ac tually, what 
prompted them to c ome into Hungary at that point?
 

>> Manny Mandel: It was  the las t one that had not been c leared.
 
>> Bill Bens on: But there had been s ome politic al c hange in Hungary, right? 
 

>> Manny Mandel: That was  perhaps  the leas t s ignificant of the reas on.  They were 

c oming as  a c ons equenc e
 -- 
and in relation to that, the Ally c onnec tion with Germany 
c eas ed and the Horthy, the region of Hungary, was  no longer in c harge and the c harge 
c ame from the Hungarian fas c is t government, the Arrow Cros s .
 
But what happened to us  is  that almost as  s oon as  Eic hmann arrives  two men 
from k ind of a s ubgenerated res c ue c ommittee, as  they c all thems elves , ins is t on 
approaching Eic hmann.  Ladies  and gentlemen, you need to unders tand you don't jus t go 
up to the Majes tic  Hotel and s ay I want to s peak  to Adolf Eic hmann.  I'm not trying to 
c ompare the two.  If I was  in Rome and I want to s ee the Pope, I c ouldn't quite walk  up to 

the Vatic an and s ay "I want to s ee the Pope."  Thes e people ins is ted and thank  God they 

did.
 
The leader of this  twosome was  a Hungarian J ewish attorney from the 
Romanian part of Hungary, the City of Kluc he called Kuns z entniklos.  
Again, multiple 

names . Who began to dis c us s ion with Eic hmann a propos ition that is  about as ridic ulous  

as  it c ould be, this  was  it.
 
If Eichmann will releas e a million J ews , a million J ews  from the various c amps , 
they will s upply him with 10,000 truc k s  with c ertain material, tea, c offee and other k inds  of 

things  for the German war.  Now, the problem was  many fold bes ides  the fact that it 

c ouldn't happen.  But the point was  that Eichmann didn't have million people to releas e.  
There were no million people anymore.  Most had been k illed.
 
Secondly, thes e guys  had about as  muc h opportunity to have 10,000 truc k s .  
They did have a bicyc le pump or a hubc ap, not 10,000 truc k s .
 
>> Bill Bens on: It was  a c ompletely audacious propos al.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely abs urd.  And they k new it.  One of the two, in fac t, is 
s ent
 -- 
he s ent through Turk ey to go to Egypt to talk  to the Britis h High Command to 
dis c us s  truc k s .  He's  arres ted in Syria.  Spends  the res t of his  war in jail in Cairo as  a s py, 

s urviv es  the war but nothing happens.
 
The point of this  abs urdity at leas t was  the beginning of a pos s ibility.  The 
negotiations  c ontinued and c ontinued.  And do unders tand that thes e negotiations  did not 

11
  
begin with Eic hmann.  They were all the way up to Goering, Heydrich, Himmler.  He was  
number three in the German government.  There was  a man name by Himmler, the head 

of SS.  He was  direc tly inv olved.  But the whole thing had to do with the fact that Nazi 
government leaders hip k ind of smelled the fac t that the is s ues  of the war were not going in 
their favor.  This  was  around D Day already.  The only las t ins tanc e was  the Battle of the 

Bulge.  The point was  they k ind of smelled the end.  They were looking to find a way in 

s ome way do s omething for their life after the war.
 
As a sid
e bar, I will tell y ou that Eic hmann, in fac t, is not arrested.  He is  arres ted 
but he als o es c apes .  And he winds  up
 -- 
any body know where he winds  up?  Eic hmann?  
He was  c aptured by the Is rael Sec ret Service many years  later in Argentina.  He didn't 

nec e
s s arily go to Argentina with our valuables  that were c ollec ted bec aus e the truc k s  
c ould not be made available.  Money was  c ollec ted, s ignific ant money from all over the 
world for a group of 1700 people to be tak en in the 35
-
c ar train from Budapes t.  I will
 
tell 
you about that in one minute after I finis h Eic hmann.
 
Eic hmann and his henchmen and the others  us ed the valuable to es tablis h lives  
for thems elves .  You might k now Dr.
 
Mengele who did all the experimentation in 
Ausc hwitz.  He als o ends  in Argentina. 
 
He was  c aptured and tak en to Is rael and tried and 
hanged.  That's  the point, that's  how thes e people found their ways  and many others  

whom they never found after the war with the k ind of stuff they would c ollec t from thes e 
1700 people.
 
The s elec tion of thes e 1700 people was  a very c omplex is s ue.  Everybody in 
Hungary certainly whoever had any interes t in that land over there c alled then
-
Pales tine 
whic h bec ame Is rael held various  k inds  of c ertific ates  for contributions  made to the J ewis h 
National Fund.  This  is  an organization whic h bought lands  and whic h s ettlements  c ould 
be s tarted in the early 1900s  and through the '20s  and '30s .  For reas ons  I c annot explain, 
the German government ac c epted thes e c ertificates  as proof of our being dis placed 

pers ons  during
 
the war.  And they s erv ed as  exit vis as for this  1700 group.
 
Folk s , if you hav e ever s een a three
-
dollar bill, this is  one of them, a three
-
dollar 
bill.  We were to be tak en to a neutral point and dis patc hed from Europe bec aus e Hitler's  

pos ition was  to get J ews  out of Germany, out of Europe, and then out of the world.  He 

didn't get to the third part.
 
We were plac ed in this  trailer of 35 c ars .  1700 people, maybe 50 or 60 people 
to a c ar depending and trans ported north.  The leaders hip of this  group did no
t k now 

where we were going and which port we were going to.
 
As  it happens , we found ours elves  not far from Hannov er in a c onc entration 
c amp, not a k illing c amp but c onc entration c amp c alled Bergen
-
Belsen.  We were told this  

would be a three
-
day R&R, rest a
nd rec uperation, s topped before we boarded the s hips .  
After s ix week s  of R&R, about 350 people were tak en by the Germans  as  part of the 

negotiations  and tak en to Switzerland.  Gues s  what, I wasn't one of them.  I s tayed a full 
5 
1/2 months .
 
>> Bill Bens on: Your father was  not with you.
 
>> Manny Mandel: No, I will talk  about that in a s ec ond.
 
My mother, my father
 -- 
my unc le and I, my father's  younger brother and I were, 
in fac t, tak en out of Germany by German troops , Ric k ety old troop trains  and tak en to 
S
witzerland.  My war was  over at this  time.  This  is Dec ember
 
1944.  The war ends  on 

12
  
May
 
8th, 1945.  I will c omment about that later.
 
My father is  in labor c amp as  he had been from '42
 
on.  He c ould not
 -- 
bec aus e 
he didn't have the c hoice of joining us .  Had he been able to join us , we would have found 
s pac e for him.  He does  s urvive the war.  We meet later in 1946.  So from '42
 
to '44, I s ee 
him intermittently.  From '44
 
to '46, I don't s ee him at all.  After thos e years  we had to 
rees tablis h a relationship bec aus e there's  a differenc e with being 8 and being 12, or 7 and 
11 or whatever.  So we did meet up.
 
>> Bill Bens on: What were your c onditions  lik e bec aus e you were part of a s elec t group, if 

you will, in Bergen
-
Belsen?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Becaus e we are part of a celeb group, we were the golden eggs  laid by 

the goos e.  We were the hos tages .  If they k illed us , they would have nothing to negotiate 
with.  I mean, they would not hav e gotten the monies  which were giv en in s uitc as es .  The 
valuables  here were things  you c ould c arry in a s uitc as e.
 
Money was  not an is s ue bec aus e the only valuable money that exis ted in 
Europe then were the Americ an dollars  and the British pound s terling whic h nobody had.  
But jewelry of every k ind and gold and s ilv er, rubies , whatever else had intrins ic  value 
were the barter, negotiation funds  that were used.
 
If they had begun to k ill us  or k illed us  totally, whic h they c ould hav e done, they 
would not hav e been able to get this .  And that would have been a dis as ter for them.
 
As  a c onsequence, although we had all the amenities  that Bergen
-
Belsen 
prov ided, we did not go to work .  Now, an 8
-
year
-
old wouldn't have gone to work  anyhow.  
But we were in thes e barrac k s , in thes e c ompounds .  Thes e were the Hungarian 

c ompound where we were all b
y ours elv es .  So there was  the advantage of having a 
s lightly eas ier life but the difficulties  of the k ind of weather in Germany, the k ind of daily 

c ensus  we had to do, three, four hours  in the mud.  The k ind of no food or lac k  of food 

whic h was  ty pic al for Bergen
-
Bels en.  So the c onditions
 -- 
the s anitation s ituation was  
horrible.
 
We had s howers  periodic ally, hot s howers .  And we didn't k now the hot s howers  
were in our c as e hot water.  In the c as e of Aus chwitz was  gas .  But what I'm s aying is  the 

c ondition
s  in Bergen
-
Belsen were horrible but terrible in the s ens e that we s urviv ed.
 
>> Bill Bens on: I was  s truc k  when we firs t met and y ou told me about that, about that part 
of your experienc e, that there were these attempts  to really try to c reate a s ens e of 
no
rmalc y in Bergen
-
Belsen in the Hungarian compound.  Say a bit about that.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Folks , the will to s urv ive is  a very powerful one.  When we got to 

Bergen
-
Belsen, we had been told to pac k  s ome food and whatev er for the journey to the 
boots , whic h
 
we never got to.
 
One of the things  that some of us k new about, maybe all of us  k new about
 -- 
I 
don't mean I but the adults , but when you tak e tin cans  and y ou us e them, you c an boil 
them and c lean them and put fres h food in them and take them to a factory
 
that we k ne w 
about that c ould res eal them s o they would be somewhat protec ted from botulism and 

things  lik e that.  My mother had s ome of thes e with her.  And s o did others.
 
After we used the food, the s upplemental food and very c arefully rationed, 
people 
dec ided what they s hould do with thes e tin cans  is  not rec yc le them in the way we 
rec yc le but to c ut them up and mak e jewelry out of it.
 
You tak e a tin c an and you mak e earrings  or brac elets  or neck lac es  bec aus e 

13
  
you have the s k ill to do it.  Now how y ou had tools  to do it I will never know.  But, for 
ex ample, the c obbler had s hoe
-
mak ing repair tools .  You c ould trade a pair of earrings  for 

s hoes  whic h you c ould then trade for two c igarettes  for s omething els e.  This  k ind of 
bus ines s  and c ommerce began under
 
the c onditions  of Bergen
-
Bels en s tric tly as  a s ign of 
s urviv al.  People needed s hoes  repaired if they pos s ibly c ould or a hairc ut or half a dozen 
other k inds  of things  that you c ould do.  Thes e were all attempts  by the people there to in 

s ome way es tablish k ind of a daily life for them that would be reminis c ent of the time 
before this  s ituation took  plac e.
 
>> Bill Bens on: You got very ill while you were there, as  I rec all.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Ev erybody has  two s ets  of lungs.  But I had triple pneumonia.  I 
don't 
k now how you do that.  The problem with pneumonia, whic h had to do with s anitation and 
being outs ide and bugs  and s o forth, the problem was there's  no treatment available for it.  
Today pneumonia is c ured very quic kly.  Firs t of all, you hav e pneumon
ia
-
preventing 
vac c ine s hot.  I jus t got my s ec ond s hot two days  ago bec aus e my doc tor s aid I s hould.  

But the point there were no treatments then bec aus e the antibiotic s  whic h were jus t being 
invented, Fleming c ame up with Penic illin in the early '40s .  And I guarantee you the firs t 
plac e it was  tes ted was not in the c onc entration c amps .
 
So there was  nothing they c ould do.  We had 35 physic ians  in the group.  
There's nothing they c ould do exc ept diagnos e, yes , you have pneumonia.  When you 
c ough, it's  going
 
to be painful.  All they c ould do is  do s ome Palliative medic ine.  It does n't 
do a thing but it mak es  you feel better.  They us ed mus tard plas ters .  Anybody hear of it?  
My family c an't talk .
 
(laughter).
 
Well, you get s ome k ind of heav y material
 -- 
I know
 
where they found it
 -- 
and 
you get s ome mus tard seed and you s oak  it in water and y ou s oak  this cloth in mus tard 

and y ou put it
 -- 
they put it on my lik e a dres s ing.  Now, it func tions as  Bengay or Vic k 's .  It 
heats  the body.  It doesn't c ure the pneumonia.  But while you hav e the pneumonia, it 
mak es  you feel better.  That's  why it's  c all palliative medic ine.  They did that to me about 
s ix week s .  Obvious ly I s urviv ed bec aus e the body c ured its elf and I was  healthy from that 

point on.  But for s ix week s , I
 
was  flat on my back .
 
>> Bill Bens on: As  you told us  earlier in Dec ember of 1944, for you, the war was  
effectively over when y ou made it to Switz erland to a neutral c ountry.  And as  you als o 
s aid, your father was  not with y ou.
 
Tell us  where
 -- 
he was  in the labor c amps .  But when he got out of the labor 
c amps , what did he do when he returned to Budapes t?  And did he k now anything about 
about y ou?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Not when he returned.  He returned to Budapes t before Budapes t's  

liberation, quote
-
unquote, by the Rus s ians  which was  a pec uliar k ind of liberation.  It 

eliminated the Nazis  but c reated other problems.
 
My father's  younges t brother was  with us  in c amp.  He was  ins trumental get c an 
us  into the group.  His  named was  David.  And my wife and I dec ided if
 
we hav e a s on, his  
name would be David.  And David is s itting right over there.
 
My father was
 -- 
by the time that we left Hungary, he was  no longer in territorial 
Hungary, he and his  group went into Uk raine for s imilar work .  In '44
 
as  the war was  
moving 
in revers e for the Naz is, the guards  and the other k inds  of res tric tions  were kind 

14
  
of
-- 
not lifted but they dis appeared.
 
My father and about 20 other men in his  particular platoon, brigade, c ommand, 
whatever it is , dec ided to walk  away.  They walk ed from the Uk raine bac k  to Budapes t.
 
They walk ed at night.  They s lept during the day .  They s tole food wherever they 
c ould.  They c ooked the food in ex haus t of truc k s .  They did what they could to s urv ive.  
My father is  bac k  in Hungary and the Nazis  were s till there.  He had s ome affiliation with a 

noteworthy man, Raul Wallenberg who is s ued Swis s  exit vis as .  He is s ued thes e Visas  
whic h were about as  v aluable as  a three
-
dollar bill.  But the Germans  ac c epted them.  And 
they us ed three
-
dollar bill again for the s ame reas on.  And thos e that could find the way to 

get out of Hungary were able to s urviv e bec ause of Wallenberg's  involv ement.  For thos e 

of you who c ame to the mus eum this  morning, if you didn't c ome on the 14th street s ide 
but on the 15th street s ide where the plaza is , that's  c alled Raul Wallenberg place in honor 
him to have a two
-
bloc k area.  Fifteenth s treet was  renamed Raul Wallenberg in honor of 

him who was  v ery ins trumental.
 
My father was  in peripheral c ontac t with him.  He lived
 -- 
he found our 
apar
tment.  And he was able to loc ate the man who was  involved in negotiations .  This  
Hungarian J ewis h lawyer by the name of Kas ztner.  He was  able to after s ome diffic ulties  

to get Kas ztner to tell him that we were, in fac t, are in Bergen
-
Bels en.  Bec aus e the
 
group 
of s pec ial nature was  trac eable through the Red Cros s .  They k new where we were.  
Couldn't c ontac t us  when we left Bergen
-
Bels en.  And they talk ed about the fac t we went 
from Switz erland were plac ed in a c hildren's  home, lik e a boarding s chool.  You
 
s aw a 
pic ture of it.  You had to be s omewhere.
 
My mother was  a teac her there.  She was as s igned to that plac e bec ause there 
had to be s omebody there who s pok e Hungarian to us  and c ould s peak  German or Frenc h 

to the res t of the adminis tration.  My mother had very good German from s c hool and s he 

had pas s able Frenc h.  The leaders hip of the s chool of the Heiden Sc hool was  a German 

J ew by the name of Miller whom we later met in Philadelphia.  But the point is  s he was  
there, s he was  able to tak e s ome trips
 -- sh
e was  paid a salary.  She look ed up a 
c olleague of my father's, a c antor, with whom my father s tudied in Vienna.
 
As  a Swis s  c itizen, he c ould mak e c ontac t.  My mother c orres ponded with him 
and c orres ponded to Noi and Noi talk ed to my mother.  That was  the c ontac t that 

es tablis hed we were alive.  We c ouldn't go to where we were and he c ouldn't c ome to 
where we were.  He did say when the opportunity c ame up, we should c ome bac k  to 

Hungary whic h my mother refus ed.  She said she will nev er s et foot in Hungary ever again 

and s he didn't.
 
She dec ided this  is the original notion of the trip was  to go to Palestine on thes e 
boats .  That's  what s he would do.  She had no idea what Pales tine but that's  what s he 

would do.  We went to Pales tine in September
 
1945 on a Briti s h troop s hip.  We were 
living there.  My father joined us  there in 1946.
 
>> Bill Bens on: The war ended on a s ignific ant date.
 
>> Manny Mandel: You want my c omments on that?
 
>> Bill Bens on: Yes , I do.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Maybe there's  three very important reas ons  for existing.  The war 
ended.  It is  the birthday  of the Pres ident of the United
 
States  in that year.  You rec all who 
that was ?  It was  not Roos ev elt.  Roos evelt died in April and the Pres ident after 

15
  
15
 
minutes  bec omes  Harry Truman.  I don't remember the year he was  born.  But we hav e 
the war ending on May
 
8th, Harry Truman's  birthday and, of c ours e, my birthday is  on 
May
 
8th.  The three important reas ons  for c elebration of the war, Harry and I. 
 
(laughter).
 
>> Bill Bens on: So your family got reunited in Palatine, in Is rael.  What did y our family do 
to try to res ume life?
 

>> Manny Mandel: My mother got a job being kind of a c aretak er for a c hild.  My father got 
a job at a c antor.  And my father had a partic ular thought in life.  My father, as  I s aid to 
you 
before, c ame from a family of seven.  T wo of the women died before I was  born of various  

dis eas es  in 1930 or '31.
 
The third s is ter c ame to the United
 
States  in 1914.  My grandfather who was  not 
very s uc c es s ful dec ided that if my Aunt Helen, the oldes t of his  c hildren, were to c ome to 

Philadelphia to live with a c ous in that would reduc e his  burden at home.  And s he did.  

She c ame to Philadelphia, married in Philadelphia, had three children.  Lived to be 

90
-
s ome years  old and had a v ery nic e life.
 
Bu t my 
father's  one brother, his  younges t brother Dav id, was  with us .  T wo other 
brothers  died during the war.  So my father dec ided that what he would lik e to do in 1947 

is  c ome to the States  to vis it his  s is ter who he hadn't seen s ince 1914.  It was  s uc h a long
 

time but my eldes t aunt never met my younger unc le.  He was  born after s he left.
 
My father c ame to Philadelphia, v is its  with my aunt and was  able to mak e s ome 
arrangements  which gave
 -- 
whic h was  an idea that was  s ugges ted to him that maybe 
what he ought to do is  stay here and bring us  over, whic h ev entually after c ertain k inds  of 

negotiations  he was able to do.
 
>> Bill Bens on: How old were you when you arrived?
 
>> Manny Mandel: 1913
 -- 
1913.  (laughter).
 
I was  13.
 
>> Bill Bens on: My las t ques tion of you before we have time for a few ques tions  from our 
audienc e, 13
 
y ears  old, all that you had been through in Hungary and then S witzerland 
and then to Pales tine.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Whic h bec omes Is rael.
 
>> Bill Bens on: While y ou are there.
 
>> Manny Mandel: I went from war to war.
 
>> Bill Bens on: And now you arriv e in the United
 
States . What was  that lik e for you as  a 
13
-
y ear
-
old boy?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Well, bes ides  it being fas c inating and bewildering, it was  also one 

more adjus tment I had to mak e.  And I'll tell
 
you about one part of that adjus tment.
 
I mean, the s ubway in New
 
York  whic h is  where we lived for the firs t year was  
unus ual.  Budapes t has the s ec ond
-
oldes t s ubway in the world.  Sk ys crapers , Venetian 
blinds , they us ed to be Chic let mac hine in the s ubway
 
s tations  for a nic k el, that was  v ery 
interes ting.
 
The one thing that was  a major adjus tment was that my Englis h was  literally 
non
-
exis tent.  Englis h was  taught from the fifth grade on in Is rael, in Pales tine until one 

day the teac her c omes  in, if you k now
 
s omething about the his tory, you k now that the 
Britis h were not our friends .  The teac her c omes  in who was  trained in England and s ays , 

ok ay, as  of tomorrow, we are no longer going to s tudy English.  Terrific .  We're going to 

16
  
s tudy Americ an.
 
(laughter).
 
S
o my Englis h and my American was  not particularly s trong.  Left a lot to be 
des ired.
 
Now, to arrive s ome plac e and not k now the language is  difficult.  And I c an 
illus trate by it by s omething.  But there were bright people around.  My parents  were 
look ing 
for a s c hool.  They thought of a paroc hial s c hool.  That didn't work  out bec aus e 
they decided bec aus e of my Englis h I s hould be in third grade.  Now, it's  not the ques tion 

of what grade y ou're in but a third grader and sev enth grader and have little in c ommon in 

many ways .  If you k now anything about the development of people, the age of third grade 

and the age of s eventh is  quite different.
 
We then dis c ov ered that the apartment we had s ublet for the s ummer was  a 
bloc k  away from PS number 3 in New
 
York.  Fo
r you New
 
York ers , it's  in the village.  It's 
off Huds on Street which is  the end of 8th Avenue around Saint Chris topher's .  We walk ed 

to the s c hool.  My parent's  Englis h was  not much better.  My father had the bes t having 
been here for a year.  We talk ed to the princ ipal about what we're going to do.
 
We c ame up with a brilliant rec ommendation but it was an adjus tment.  He s aid, 
ok ay, the k id's  in s ev enth grade.  We will put him in the s eventh grade.  We have 7A and 
7B.  If he was  able to pic k  up enough language in 7B, we'll put him in eighth grade.  If not, 
we'll k eep him in 7th grade which mak es  good sens e.  However, s inc e we are teac hing 
Spanis h in 7th grade, we will exc us e him from Spanis h and give him an extra study hall s o 

we c an learn s ome more Englis h.  That was  another adjus tment I had to make.
 
>> Bill Bens on: And adjus t you did.  And here we are today in 2016.
 
>> Manny Mandel: And I learned s ome Englis h.  (laughter).
 
>> Bill Bens on: Very effec tively.
 
We have time for jus t one or two ques tions  from our audienc e.  If you have a 
ques tion, we will have a mic rophone handed to you s o wait until y ou have a mic.  You will 
mak e your ques tion as  short as  you can, and I'll repeat it jus t to be s ure that all of us , 
inc luding Manny and the audienc e, hears  the question.  So I think  we c an do one or two 

ques tions .
 
Anybody have a ques tion they would like to as k ?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Not all at onc e.  (laughter).
 
>> Bill Bens on: We got one, I think
 -- 
there's  a hand right there.  There we go.  Thank  you. 
 
>> Do I need to stand up?
 
>> Bill Bens on: No, you're fine.
 
>> Thank  you.  I was  jus t trying to s ee you.  (laughter).
 
Sir, I don't k now if you k now anything about the rhetoric  that was  going on in 
Europe and Hungary and that k ind of thing in the 1930s  or whatev er or if you 
s tudied 

thos e.  Is  there any s imilarities  in the rhetoric  agains t the J ews  that went on then as  to 
s ome of the rhetoric  that s eems to be happening in the United
 
States  today?
 
>> Manny Mandel: I heard.
 
>> Bill Bens on: You heard the ques tion.  To the extent that you feel c omfortable 
answering that.
 
>> Manny Mandel: It's  very diffic ult.  Firs t of all, I'm not an expert in it.
 
I would s ay this, unfortunately rhetoric  s ounds  s imilar.  But the goals  of the 

17
  
rhetoric  are quite different.  No plac e in the his tory of
 
the world that I k now of and anybody 
in this room
 -- 
I would be willing to be c hallenged
 -- 
c an talk  about the fac t that rhetoric  
was  des igned for extermination.  Now, there's  an enormous  differenc e between the goal 
being extermination and the goal being all k inds of other ac ts , good, bad and otherwise.  
What I'm s aying is the words  may s ound alike but the goal of the words  was  unique to that 

period of time.  And today 's  words  don't have that as  a goal.  I hope I have res ponded as  

well as  I c ould.
 
>> Bill 
Bens on: Thank  y ou.
 
I think  we may have one more ques tion.  The lights  are s o bright hard to s ee out 
in the bac k .
 
No hands , I think  we're good to go.  We're going to c onc lude the program in jus t 
a moment.  I want to first thank all of you for being here.  Remind you that we will do "Firs t 

Pers on" programs  twice a week , Wednesdays  and Thurs days , through the middle of 

Augus t.  We will soon begin liv e s treaming a number of the programs , I think , beginning in 

April.  So you will be able to pic k  them up through the Internet and we think  that's  a very 
exc iting development.  Programs  will be heard any where for that matter.  So join us  one 
way or the other.  Come bac k  here or lis ten over the Internet if you c an.
 
It's  our tradition at "Firs t Pers on" that our "Firs t Pers on" gets  the las t word.  So 
I'm going to turn bac k  to Manny to c los e our program.  When he finishes , Manny will s tay 
up on the s tage here.  Our photographer J oel is  going to c ome up on the s tage and tak e a 
photograph and we'll as k  you to ris e bec ause he's  going to tak e a picture with you as  the 

bac k ground to the photograph.  Bec ause we didn't have time for more ques tions , 

abs olutely feel free when we finish to come up on s tage and talk  with Manny, as k  him 
another ques tion or jus t s hak e his  hand if you want to do that.  So we welc ome you to 
c ome up here and do that when we c los e the program.
 
Manny?
 
>> Manny Mandel: In my pres entation to you folk s  and answers  to thos e ques tions , I s aid 
things  lik e this  many times .  I s aid I don't k now if you k now, you s hould
 
know, you s hould 
remember. Work ing here at the mus eum for a good number of years  now, I find that the 
k nowledge of his tory is  abominable.  It's  a big ward but that's  what it is . What I would like 

to c all your attention the words  of a philosopher, his torian about a hundred years  ago.  
Remember his  words , thos e who do not learn their his tory well may be deemed or 
doomed to repeat it or parts of it.  And if any of you remember who that was , I will remind 

you.  It was  a member of George Santayana who was  teac hing in California at the time of 

Italian extrac tion.  
 
I leave you with the words  that s ay, folk s , s inc e we cannot learn from the future but we c an 
learn from the pas t, learn the pas t, learn his tory, all k inds  of his tory, Holoc aus t, 

United
 
States , or anything els e becaus e it's  the only thing we c an learn from to impac t the 
future.  I leave you with that thought.
 
>> Bill Bens on: Thank y ou, Manny.
