times whatever they 
ate, give me also, sit and eat with us. But 
they, most of them, th

A: Listen, I personally, whatever I did, I

because it™s a lot of things not pleasant, a 
lot of them pleasant. I took revenge as a 
child, I was f Œ 14 years old. Wh atever I did, I did. 
Q: Okay. I wasn™t asking in this sense ab

farms there were in 
Silesia
, beautiful land. And you™re talking th ere Œ there was a Œ 
about 15,000 Œ 15 million Germ
ans there. And 12 million,
 they pushed
 them out 
there, a lot of Œ right aw
ay, a lot of Œ pushed them
, and they took ad vantage 
Russia
. 
If they find a Russian soldie
r killed, they burn

soldiers. And he tells me, 
Vaska
(ph) be careful. I™m going to finish th

 His family, before the 
war broke out, came to 
Odessa
 to visit relatives, and 
the Germans killed them. He 
said, I have to take revenge for them. This
 is only one of those. In a lot of those

commander. And we got caught in 
Jerusalem
. We used to Œ all the convoys to 
Jerusalem
 because the Jord

 area. Then we organized the 180 
trucks, and we were securing them.

60,000 Jews. And th is co
nvoy wouldn™t arrive 
Jerusalem

Jerusalem
 would fell.

Burma 
road, because from the beginning we 
couldn™t get there with Œ with
 trucks, with nothing. We brought over thousands of 
people from one side, and on th e other si
de, and people with hammers, wi-with 
shovels, with everything, made a little pass
. And used to Œ one side used to come 
from tele Œ

side. Trucks with food, with 
ammunition, whatever we need, 
and carry on the b Œ on their 
backs, on their arms, to the other side, and lo ad the 
other trucks, go to 
Jerusalem
. That™s what started 
Burma
 road. And lit Œ and we 
were securing the area, because the Jordan

And little by little, brought tractors and 
blew out, and we made a road.

180 people Œ soldier died, in
 those couple months. And we
 went back in this area 
after the ceasefire. The m
eantime, it was an embargo. 
But when the British left on

 come in, with weapons. We got a lot

by little, we rebuilt, and we start to push th
e Arabs back. When th
ere was the second 
ceasefire, we were in a different situation 
because we could bring in everything, just 
money. And with money you know from wh
ere it came. Who could give the money? 
American 
Joes

ould you want them to understand about 
what happened? 
A: It™s very hard to Œ even 
to think what to say. What ca
n I tell them? I can tell them 
my story. I can tell them that people should behave a little bit different to us. That™s 
all. What can I tell them more? T h at the whole world, even 
United States
, they 
knew wh at™s going on in  
Europe
, they knew what the Germ
an do to the Œ not only 
to the Jews, they killed also five million

give a speech about this? Maybe they were 
too busy with Œ with their own war, but 
they should at least say  something.  
Q: A real abandonment. 
A: Yeah. When I was hiding, I didn™t 
maybe think about this, I wasn™t maybe 
enough old to think things like this, but afte
r, I start to think, where all the world 
was? And they had th e power to do some
thing. Maybe not Œ maybe if they would 
threaten 
Germany
 that we will wipe you up of 
the wa Œ of the war, maybe they 
would behave a little b it themselv es
, but they didn™t do nothing.  
Q: You were telling me also earlier that th
ere were young men when you were Œ you 
know, when you were 
still in the ghetto in 
Mlynov
, who went to the Judenrat, and 
instead of giving the gold to
 th e Germans, the young men were saying, give it to us 
so that we can get weap ons. Ho w do you 
explain that, that the young men wanted 
this, and the Œ and th e older men, the 
Judenrat
 did otherw ise? 
A: I don™t know wh at to tell you, I just give you th e story, what was, the time was 
witnesses to this. They  begged to them, gi
ve us money, give us something that you 
give away to the German, we™ll buy so me
 and try to surv ive. Maybe 25 percent 
would su rvive, but give us 
something. Let us at least 
do something, not to go like 
sheeps to Œ to the killing area
. I don™t know, maybe this wa
s the Œ the Œ for years the 
Jews were depressed. Maybe the Œ they
 were too religious
 and b-believing in  
something th at cannot help us. Can only pray and can believe in something Œ I don™t

know. I™ve no explan ation. As I told you, 
that I don™t believe any more in this 
traditional religion, because 
when I crawled between the 
legs to the synagogue Œ 
why? Because I want to also hear th-the pray ing, and I saw wh at™s going on, 
everybody™s crying and everybody is begging,
 and the roof didn™t
 open up and those 
– and th e angels didn™t come and sa
ve us. And what can I tell you mo re? 
Q: Yeah. When Œ I™m sorry. 
A: No problem. 
Q: When  Œ when  did it become possible 
for you to  open up and talk about si Œ 
because clearly ther
e™s such a cost. 
A: The last couple years. 
Q: And why?
