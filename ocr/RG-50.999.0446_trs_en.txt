we'll have an opportun ity for you t o ask Susan a few questions.  
 
 
The lif e st ories of Holocaust survivors transcend the 
decades.  What you are about t o hear from Susan is one

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her
 
int roduction.  
 
 
Susi Hilsenrath was born in Bad Kreuznach, Germany.  She 
was the eldest of three children.  Here we see Susan's f amily.   
From left  to right is her brot her Joseph, mother Ani wit h ^  in her

Here we see Susan and her brother Joseph.  
 
 
On November 9
-
10, 1938, known as Kristallnacht,  or Night  
of  Broken Glass, Nazi thugs smashed the windows and 

furnishings of t he Hilsenrath family's home.  Months later, Susan 
and Joseph were 
smuggled t o France.  
 
 
In May 1940, the German Army invaded France.  Susan and 
Joseph were evacuated from a children's home in Paris to 
Versailles, where they were t emporarily housed in Louie XIV's 
palace.  Soon German soldiers arrived and t he children fled wit h 
their guardians to the unoccupied part of the country under the

>> Susan Warsinger:  Well, many changes happened in my family 
after the
 
Nazis came into power.  I 'm going to t ell you all of t hese 
st ories from a child's point of  view,  because that 's the way I 

remember it.  So you will just  have to bear with me if I get to be a 
lit tle bit childish every once in a while.  
 
 
I remember we moved a lot.  We lived, had lived in a very 
nice house.  All of a sudden, we didn't live in a spacious house 
anymore.   It seemed to me like we were always moving from one 
abode to another, which was on an economic level.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  With each move?  
 
>>
 
Susan Warsinger:   Wit h each move.  What happened was my 
father had a thriving linen store and all of a sudden he didn't have 

it anymore.   He was boycott ed.  How many of  you have been to 
the permanent exhibit? If  you remember,  there's this one big 
exhibit 
with an SA man st anding in front of a store, and he is 
saying,  "Buy only in German shops, buy only from German 

people," as if we were not  German people.  So my f ather lost
 -- 
can you hear me when I'm t alking t his way or do you want me
 -- 
>> Bill Benson:  
You're good.

>> Susan Warsinger:  Can you hear me all right?  OK.  
 
 
All of sudden he didn't have his st ore anymore.   I remember 
he had t o go to a farm t o sell strawberries and cherries to the 
people who were in our town.   That 's how he had t o make his 
l
iving.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I remember you t elling me that  when he would 

come home aft er he was f orced t o go and sell cherries and 
st rawberries, that you knew when he had been able to sell a f ew 
by just  the look on his face.  I think you said he was smiling 
when 
he'd come back, you knew he had been successful t hat particular 
day.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger
:  Yeah, yeah.   We had some special signal, I 
remember between us.  I  remember, I don't know, maybe it was 
how many baskets he sold or something.  It was just a private 
thing I had wit h my f at her t hat I  remember.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Tell us about the town. 
 
What kind of town was it?  

Was it  a small town?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Bad Kreuznach is a spa.  I t's a place where 

people come to recuperate from all kinds of illnesses.   A lot of 
people come there f or pleasure, because it's a beautif ul town.  It

something.   They had a thriving Jewish community 
living t here.  And t hen
 -- 
>> Bill Benson:  Your family had been there f or a long t ime?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah, my parents got  married there.  
 
>> Bill 
Benson:  How large was your family?  Your ext ended 
f amily.   
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Well, we had a lot of relatives that were 

living in Germany.   I'll t ell you at  the end.   The only ones that  
survived was my family,  my immediate family.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  It
 
was a large extended family?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yes.   All of those didn't make it out.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  What  about your schooling in those early years?  

I remember you telling me that  your first years of  school were 
really not  very happy years f or y
ou.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  No, t hey were not  happy at  all.  I hat ed 

going to school, because kids were making fun of  me.  I seemed 
to be a normal litt le girl.  I wasn't quit e sure why they were making 
fun of me.  So one day I didn't have t o go to school an
ymore.  I tell 
you, I was really happy.   The reason f or me not having t o go to

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

school anymore was because Jewish kids weren't allowed t o go to 
public school anymore.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And t hen what  happened?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Well, we had numerous Je
wish f amilies in 
our t own,  so t he Jewish families hired one teacher, and they hired 
one room, and t his part icular t eacher had to teach the kids from 
first grade to 10th grade, all in this room.   One grade sat in t his 
row, the second grade.  We had 10 rows and he had to teach us 
all of t he subjects.  
 
 
I t ell you,  we did OK.  We learned a lot .  We learned a lot 
from each other.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And it was happier?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   I t was.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You shared with me an incident where your 

m
ot her had sent you to get bread, and you had to go t hrough a 
park.  
 

>> Susan Warsinger:  You want me to t ell you about t hat?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I do, yeah.   
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  OK.  I hope you want to listen t o this.  I was 
this little kid, and my mother used to give me t he responsibility of  

10

going t o the grocery st ore.  She gave me some money, she asked 
me t o go to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread.    So I f elt very 
proud of  myself, because I  was the one that was providing 
nutrition to my f amily.  
  
[Laughter]
 
Here, we live here, and the grocery st ore,  let's say it 's at  the back 

of  the audit orium.  In order to get t o the grocery store, I had t o 
walk through a park.  I st art ed, I had t o go down the st airs, I 
walked down the stairs.  The caretaker of the park came to me, he 
said, "Litt le girl, you cannot go t hrough t his park anymore. "  I 
couldn't figure out why I couldn't go through t he park.  I went 
home to my mot her and I t old her.  She said, "Well, just walk 
around t he park t o get t here, walk t his w
ay, that way,  go all t he 
way around."  
 
 
So the next  time she gave me the money to go to buy 
somet hing, maybe it  was milk, so I got to t he steps of the park,  

and I said to myself,  I was very t ired, so I thought , well, maybe I 
would cut t hrough, because I just didn't  want t o take all t he way 
around.  So I  went through the park, and the caretaker came, and 
he started to throw rocks at  me, and he st art ed t o say horrible 

11
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

things about me.  I was this little girl.  
 
 
That  wasn't the worst part .  The worst part of
 
my 
remembrance is he had a young girl who was just about my age, 
and she saw her f ather doing what he was doing, and he was her 
role model.   So she copied what he was doing, and she kept  on 
throwing rocks at me,  calling me a dirty Jew and all kinds of ot h
er 
things.  
 
 
So I would never walk through that park again.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, in 1938 your mother had another
 
child, I 
think your brother Joseph.   She had no choice but  to have him at 
home.   Why was that?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Well,  Jewish people
 
weren't  allowed to go 
to the hospit al.  They had to have t heir baby at home.  The pict ure 
that you people saw bef ore was my brother and I.  We were sitt ing 
on t he steps,  and we were sit ting outside because my mother was 
having a baby.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Y
ou described a f ew minut es ago remembering 
moving from place to place, and each time it was a smaller and as 
you said lower down t he socioeconomic scale.  At one point, you 
ended up in a place called Adolf Hitler Platz, was the name of the 

12
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

place before you
 
lived.   You were living in a place wit h, I believe,  a 
rabbi and his family.   Tell us a little about t hat.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  OK.  Is it  OK wit h you?  OK.  
 
 
It was a house, it was like an apartment house,  it had like 
f our f loors.  On t he f irst floor, 
my family occupied t he first  floor.  
The rabbi lived on the second f loor.   A non
-
Jewish f amily lived on 
the third floor.  And on the f ourt h floor was an attic.   Well, it  was 
one night my brother and I were very excited because the next 
day it was going to be my mother's birthday, and it  was November 
9,  1938.  
 
 
All of a sudden,  these bricks, rocks were being thrown 
through our window.   My brot her was a year younger t han I  am,  
but he was the brave one.  He went to the window,  and he looked 
outside, and he sa
id to me that it was our neighbors t hat were 
throwing the rocks and the bricks through the window.   And he 

said there are several policemen,  and if  you had gone upstairs t o 
see the civil policemen, they're wearing the big, funny hats, 
wearing t his blue unform.  He was st anding outside, like this, at  
the edge of t he crowd.  He wasn't doing anyt hing at all to st op the 
people from t hrowing the bricks and rocks t hrough the window.  
 

13

So we were very scared, my brot her and I really were 
scared.  We started to wa
lk across t he hall t o our parents' 
bedroom, and just as we were doing that some people had 
uprooted a telephone pole, and t hey smashed it through the front 
door, and our f ront door was made out of glass.  I t was made out 
of  beaut iful colored glass.  They smashed through the f ront door,  
and the glass was being strewn all over.   So we ran to our 
parents' bedroom, and we said, " My goodness, what 's 
happening?"   
 
 
They always t ried to protect us, and t hey always never tried 
to tell us what was happening.   So my 
father said, "Well, let's just 
go hide up in the attic."  
 
 
So we went up to the att ic, and the rabbi's family was 
already t here, but the rabbi wasn't  there.   We found out later that 
the people who went t hrough our apartment,  they looted a lot of 
our belongings.  Also, when they got to the rabbi's apartment  they 
destroyed all of  his art ifacts and his books and much of his 
furniture.   
 
 
So we were hiding up in the attic.   I looked out, t here was 
this little window and I looked out, and the rabbi was standing
 
on

his veranda.  There were two SA men,  the brown shirt s probably 
that you learned upst airs in the PE, they were holding him.  
Another one came along and took ahold of him, cut off his beard 
and sent him to jail.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You saw t hat?  
 
>> Susa
n Warsinger:  Yes,  I did see that.  I did.   
 
 
So I went , I found out lat er that they didn't  only do it to our 
apartment, to the people in our building,  but they did it to everyone 
in our community.   Not only did t hey do that to every Jewish family 
in t he c
ommunity, but  t hey did loot all of  t he Jewish stores t hat 
were left that were selling to Jewish people, because nobody else 

was buying from t hem.   Also, they burnt  down our synagogue.   
Not only did t hey do that in our town of  Bad Kreuznach, but t hey 
did it
 
all over Germany.   That 's why it's remembered as the Night 
of Broken Glass, which is called Kristallnacht.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  November 9
-
10,  your mot her's birthday in 1938.   
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.  
 

>>
 
Bill Benson:  Hundreds of synagogues in Germany were 
burned t hat night.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.  
 

15

>> Bill Benson:  Did you have any idea aft er that that it was 
widespread, that that pogrom was everywhere in the country?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   No, I  di
dn't know about  it  until much later.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  With the rabbi arrested,  taken away, what about 
your father?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  My f at her wasn't t aken away.  Now, let me 

tell you why.  My brother and I keep t alking about it, and I should 
have a
sked
 -- 
I mean my father has passed away, he's dead.   I 
can't ask him anymore.  I should have asked him.  But one of t he 

things that  we t hink is either that he was, because he had been 
born in Poland when he was a litt le kid, he came to Germany,  
maybe beca
use at that  time t he Nazis,  the Germans were not  at 
war wit h Poland yet, because it was bef ore they occupied Poland, 

which was in 1939.  Maybe because he played chess wit h the 
chief of police.  We t alked about a t hird reason.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Otherwise, 
thousands of Jewish men were 
imprisoned on that night ?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  You're all in the attic.  How long did you stay 
there?  
 

16
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

>> Susan Warsinger:   I  don't  remember.   Maybe a few days.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  A few 
days.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember anything of that time, being in 
that at tic and you were with t he rabbi's f amily, too?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Since it was November,  it had been the 

apple
-
picking season,  we had
 -- 
someone had gathered lots of 
apples, piles of  apples all over the attic.   So we had plent y t o eat , 

because we kept eating apples all t he time.  
 
 
Then t he kids, we played.   We played all with t hem, we 
made abacuses out of them
 -- 
abaci, sorry.  
 
>> Bill B
enson:  Abaci?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  We made abaci out of  them.  We played all 
kinds of  games with the apples.   We were innocent children.  We 
really didn't understand how serious it was.  All I  know is that  
before the Night of Broken Glass, my f at her and
 
mother used to 
have discussions whet her they wanted t o leave Germany or not, 

and my mot her was always for it  and my f at her said, "Oh, this is 
going t o blow over and everything is going to be all right."  
 
>> Bill Benson:   Hit ler can't last?  
 

17
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
 
 
>> Susan Wa
rsinger:  Yes, yes.  But after the Night of Broken 
Glass, nobody wanted to stay there anymore.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  That's when your parent s made t hat very 
prof ound decision to try to get out of Germany at  that point?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Right.  
 
>> Bill 
Benson:  After Kristallnacht when they made that decision, 
what did your parents do?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Well, my fat her realized t hat we have to get 

out of Germany, and in order t o come to t he United States, t his is 
what everybody wanted to come to, is
 
to come t o the Unit ed 
St ates, t he land of democracy and freedom and where you could 

be anyt hing you wanted to be, you couldn't come t o t he Unit ed 
St ates because t he United States had a quota, and also every 
country in the world had a quota,  except f or the
 
Dominican 
Republic.  
 

 
So my f ather said,  well,  he found this woman who was a 
French lady, and she had children of her own.  She was willing to 

do f or all of  the money t hat  he had left,  t hat  he had saved up, she 
was willing to smuggle my brother and me to
 
France.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just the two of you?  
 

18
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
 
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  The two of us.  She would pret end on t he 
train we were her children.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  This was your youngest brother,  right?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Not t he baby.  The one looking out
 
the 
window.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Year younger than you.   She'd t ake the two of  
you and your parent s,  they made t he decision t o let the two of you 
go.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger
:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess, for me,  it was like a 
big advent ure.  I didn't realize that I might never see them again.  

But I t hink that it must have been a horror for my mother, who had 
to send her children away.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I 'm sure everybody in this
 
room can't imagine 
what that  would be like t o send you away to another country.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah.  I keep thinking about when I had my 

three girls, I couldn't imagine sending them away and not  knowing 
what's going t o happen to them.  
 
 
Anywa y, 
it turned out OK.  So we went  to France, and we 
went on t he t rain and we had to keep very quiet , because we were 
supposed to be French children.  So when we got t o t he border, 

19
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
 
 
we pret ended we were sleeping and everything turned out all 
right.  And we ended
 
up in Paris.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Was t here an incident where German soldiers or 

guards boarded t he t rain?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember anything about t hat?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  We were very scared.   My brother 
remembers
 
tha t we were
 -- 
he was fast asleep.  He thinks, t his is 
his
-- 
we never asked our parents.  He thinks that  maybe she 
drugged us so we would be f ast asleep,  so we wouldn't be able to 
speak German, because she was worried that we would say 
somet hing in German and we wouldn't be her children.  But  I  don't 
know if t hat's correct or not.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You got across the border.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Went  to Paris.  Once you're there with a French

people lived in a room in a hotel.  He was a working guy.   He was 
young.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Single guy, right ?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Single guy.
 
Here he had these two children.  My brother was very nervous.  
Excuse t he expression, he used to wet himself in t he bed.  He 
was upset and anyway,  so he, the cousin, had to go t o work,
 
he 
lef t us in the room.  He said, " You stay in the room until I come 

back."  Of course,  my brot her was very curious, and he was 7, 
and he used to leave as soon as cousin
 -- 
he went on the Metro.  
In those days t he Metro was a big thing because it was the 
only 

one besides in New
 
York.  So he went on t he Met ro.   He went all 
over Paris.  He made sure that  he came home.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  7 years old?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Were you a good girl, you stayed put ?  
 
>> Susan Wa
rsinger:   Yes.  I always f ollowed the rules.  I still do 
that.  He's just more adventurous t han I am.

>> Bill Benson:  So how long was your distant cousin able t o do 
this?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Not very long.   So then he found a place 
where t hey would k eep the bread, in a small town around Paris.  
There was a lady who was taking children in,  and I  don't know 
who it was,  I think it was t he Quakers.  They were very generous 
to people.  I want to thank the Quakers a lot f or everything that 
they did.  They h
elped, and I think t hey paid f or us to st ay with this 
lady.  
 
 
We were not the only children.  We were maybe 10 children 
that were lost.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  She sort of t ook lost, orphaned children in?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  It  wasn't a happy place?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Well, it's
 -- 
there was one place, she had a 
daughter and she favored her daught er,  was very sad occasion.   
Anyway,  we complained to

>> Bill Benson:  Is this t he place where you were not allowed 

inside during the
 
day?

>> Susan Warsinger:   You remember all of  this?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I do remember this.   
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Susan Warsinger
:  Yeah, during t he day we weren't  allowed to 
go into t he house, and we had to eat in a cabin outside of the 
house.   She was French and her husband, she did the same t hing 
to her husband.  She made him stay outside too.  
 
[Laughter]
 
I remember.  The good p
art  about her husband, he was eating 
pon frietes.   Those are French fries.   That was t he first time I ate 

French f ries, the most delicious thing I ever at e.  
 
 
It was unpleasant.  She wouldn't let  us go to the bat hroom.  
We had to go in a pot in the middle
 
of the night.  We weren't  
allowed t o use the bat hroom.   In t he morning somebody had t o go 

clean up.  Somebody complained.  So he f ound us anot her 
place
 -- 
>> Bill Benson:  Your cousin.  He did get  you out of  there?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.

>> Susan Warsinger:  To anot her place.  Those were t wo ladies,  
and they were very good to us.  We went t o school in that town,  
and we learned French.  I tell you,  I  was there for a few months.  If 
you can't speak the langua
ge and you're a litt le kid, you pick it up 
right away.  I  mean, I could speak.  My vocabulary was on the 

level of  a child, but I could speak.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You could hold your own with the French kids at  

that point?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.  
 

>> Bi
ll Benson:  How long did you continue in t hat circumst ance?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Well, in 1940, I guess, all of you know in 

June of 1940 Hitler had declared that he was going to t ake over all 
of  Europe.  He walked into Austria, then he said I'm going to 
take 
over Europe.  So he t ook over Czechoslovakia.  He went  into 

Poland.  So t he next  thing he did in 1940, which is June, the Nazis 
were bombing, not Paris,  but bombing all around.  We could see 
in our bedroom, we could see the bombs f alling down f rom t he
 
German planes.  I 'm sure you've seen them in t he movies,  the 

airplanes.  It looked like the Fourth of  July.  I remember.   
 
 
So everybody got really scared.  So I don't know how we got 

24
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

to Paris, but on the day t hat  the Nazis marched into Paris my 
brot her and I were there.  He remembers it very well.  I don't know 
why we were in Paris, not in that place.  When they came walking 
int o Paris, a lot of  Parisians were really scared, not only Jewish 
people, but  we called them, t he German army, the Boche.   
Everybod
y wanted to leave.  
 
 
Some people fraternized with t he Nazis.  But most 
everybody did not.  So they want ed to leave.  I don't know if  you 
saw on the map, you see Paris here, and then just think of one of 
these rectangles as France.  Half  of it was the occu
pied zone of 
France, like half of that, and Paris is up here.  It 's t he occupied 

zone.  
 
 
So then they made some kind of a treaty wit h the French, 
and they said, well, the bot tom part  is going t o be unoccupied, and 

we were supposed t o be free,  but Petain was t he president of that 
part of France, and he was an ally,  really,  of the Nazis.  
 
 
Anyway,  so what everybody wanted t o do was get to the 
southern part of France.   But  bef ore t hat, everybody wanted to get 
out of Paris.  So I 'm going to ask the audience if they know what 
beaut iful t own is right  a little bit, 45 minutes west of Paris.

Anybody know which t own I'm t alking about?  Yeah, Versailles.  
You're absolut ely right .  
 
 
A lot  of people headed to Versailles.  Somehow, some 
people took us,  my brot her and
 
I.  I  don't know who took us.  I 
think it was two nuns.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Took you and your brot her.  Of  course, there's 
tens of  t housands of  Parisians fleeing.  I t's an exodus.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yes.   We get to Versailles.  Here is this 

poor mayor of Versailles, he doesn't know what  to do with all of 
these Parisians.  Where do you think they put us up?  Somebody 
say it.  In t he palace, right.  They took us.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Can you t ell she was a teacher?  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   I t's ver
y hard for me to keep t alking wit hout 
asking you quest ions, because I know some of you know all of the 
answers way bef ore me.  
 
 
Anyway,  what  t hey did is they gave us a burlap sack.  It was 
this tremendous haystack.  We filled the haystack with burlap,  
the
n we t ied it up, and then we went in
-- 
guess which is t he

biggest room in the palace?  Anybody know which is the biggest 
room?  It 's very beaut if ul.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I think I heard it.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Hall of Mirrors, yes.   The Hall of Mirrors. 
 
So they put  us in Hall of  Mirrors on the side.  So we were sleeping 

there.  And so I don't  know
 -- 
don't ask how many days we were 
there, because I don't  remember.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  OK,  I won't ask.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Eventually, the Nazis came t o Ve
rsailles.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You have tell us about the incident  with t he Nazi 
officer.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  OK.  We heard them marching, the st eps of 
the German army was really f rightening.   They came in with t anks, 
and they came in wit h
-- 
what are those?  Jeeps.  There was one 
guy on a motorcycle in t he front.  I don't know, he probably was 

the leader.   I don't know what his rank was.  He was the leader of 
the whole t hing.  And they got in f ront  of  t he palace, and they 
wanted t o talk, whoever t alk to t
he person in charge.  So the 
person who was in charge only knew how to speak French and 

this leader, this Nazi officer, this German off icer only knew how to 

27
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

speak German.  They needed to talk to each ot her.   So somebody 
said, "We know this girl.   She's ups
t airs in t he Hall of Mirrors.  She 
knows how to speak German."  
 
 
I was a litt le kid, and they bring me up.  There's this Nazi 
of ficer, he had on these boots.  They were all t he way up to here.  

I'm looking, I  can just see his knees, I'm looking up t o him.
  
And 
he said 
--
 
I don't know what  he said to me in German, but anyway 
I t ranslat ed whatever it was.  I don't remember what  it was.  But it 
was to their satisfaction.  
 
 
So at t he end, he goes and clicks his boot s t oget her,  and he 
bows down to me,  and he said, "Little girl, how come you know 
how t o speak German so well?"   I t ell you, I was frightened.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  I bet you were frightened.   
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah.  Anyway, I told him that the French 
schools were very good and I  had learned.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Isn't there great irony in t hat?  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Anyway,  so then we couldn't  stay there 
anymore, because it  was the occupied zone.   It wasn't safe.

>> Bill Benson:  Where did you go f rom there?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  OK, we went  to a place called
 -- 
a small 
town near Vichy, t hey had a chateau, an old cast le.  It was all 
Jewish children t here.   We knew it was not safe to stay in the 
occupied zone in Brout
-
Vernet.  I t was in the occupied zone,  but it 
would be saf er to stay in the occupied zone.   We end
ed up in the 

Chat eau des Morelles in Brout
-
Vernet .  There we went  with a 
whole bunch of children.  We went  t o school in the village, but we 

weren't  allowed t o go t o t his school in t he village wit h the kids who 
lived in t he village because
 
--
 
and t hey were 
all f armers.   These 
kids were all farmers.  They didn't want us to rub elbows wit h their 

children.  So we had, again, a school of our own,  and we had a 
French teacher who taught us and who was very good to us.  
 
 
I went back to France when I was an adult , 
I f ound out  t hat 
this teacher we had was t he mayor of a litt le town around there.  
So anyway,  he was a very nice person, and he did t each us, 
taught  us how t o write and conjugate and hist ory.  Things were

who was running it?  Well, 
Jewish people were running it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  They were running it,  OK.

because people started to find out what the Nazis had planned 
out.  By t hat t ime, I t hink they were t hinking of the Final Solution, 
and they knew t hat event ually they were going t o t ake all of  the 
people and put them in the concentration camps.  They started to 
take the people in the occupied zo

In t he m

a week, and what we did is if we knew somebody's birthday was 
coming, t he f riends and the re
latives, let's say it was my brother's 
birthday,  I and some of my friends and his friends saved their 
desserts,  dessert s from their dinners, and we went and hid t hem.   
We had these lockers,  like you have in high school, we had these 
lockers in the at tic.   
Every kid had their own little locker.  
 
 
So we hid t he desserts up in the locker and saved it up and 
saved it up, and when it was time for t he person's birthday one of  
us went to the kitchen and got one of  those
 -- 
and got one of 
those brown t rays.  We t r ied to design it  with doilies and 

somebody picked flowers and put it on t he t ray.  Everybody 
brought their st ash, and when it was the morning of t he birthday 
we used to go t o t heir room and put it
 
--
 
we were in this big 
dormit ory, but we went t o their bed 
and put t he t ray on their bed 

and sang t o them.  
 
 
We didn't know " Happy birt hday."   It was different.

probably that is a way t o survive,  because you have love, and 
then you have happiness.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Here you are with your brot her in t his home in 

southern France.  Essent ially,  one day you find out your parents 
want t o co
me get you.   They want t o get  you out of there.  Tell us 
about that.   
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah.  Sometimes t he children in the home, 
they got  word from t heir parents where they were, and they got  
them out, wherever they were, in England or Italy or whate
ver.  
They got them out.  So my brother and I always prayed maybe 
that would happen to us.  
 
 
So one day the direct or, which was a lady, the director, she 
called me up to her off ice.  Well, of course,  she only called 
anybody up t o t he off ice if t hey were bad, and so I couldn't 
imagine why she was calling me, because I was such a 
goody
-
good.   
 
[Laughter]
 
I got up t here, and she was writing.  She looked up with her 
glasses, she looked at me, she said, "Suzanne."   That 's what t hey 

33
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

called me, because my name on
 
the birt hday says Susi,  but  when 
I came to t he Unit ed States I want ed to be very sophisticat ed, so I 
changed it  to Susan.  This was a long time ago 
 
 
Anyway,  she said, "We have heard from your parents, and 
they are in the United St at es,  and they have found you here."  
This organization called HIAS and t he Quakers all have been 
working.   All these organizat ions that we give money to and 
donat e money, they really do wonderful t hings, they found us.  My 
father sent tickets, and we came to the United States.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bef ore you tell us about  gett ing to the United 

St ates, how did your parents get out of Germany and make it t o 
the United Stat es?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  OK.  My fat her had a cousin, who had a 

pickle fact ory in Brooklyn, and they knew about
 
our plight, so 
somehow or other, you know, t he United States didn't want  to 

raise t heir quot a because we were going t o be an economic 
burden to our societ y, and we were going to take away 
everybody's job.  
 
 
So she promised t hat she was not  going to let my father be 
a burden to the United Stat es.  She was going to hire him, make

sure he worked.  
 
 
So he got his affidavit.   I t was really lucky, because af ter t hat  
not many people got out of Germany.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right , because t he war is already well o
n at that 
point.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger
:  Yes.  Bef ore t he Night of  Broken Glass, all 
the Nazis wanted to do was get the Jews out of Europe, just tell 

them t o leave and they said to t he rest of t he world,  " Go take 
them," and t he rest of  the world just shut t heir eyes.  But aft er the 
Night of  Br
oken Glass,  there wasn't anyplace t o go, so not many 
people were able to get out of Germany.  So my f at her was lucky.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  But  your f ather went f irst by himself ?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yes,  because he couldn't get an af fidavit for 

his wif e and t he baby.  He came here
 -- 
>> Bill Benson:  Your mother and youngest brother are still in 
Germany at  t hat point?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yes.   Yes.  Then he got my mot her and the 
baby out.  I  guess, again, I did not ask enough of my f ather and 
mother how
 
all of this happened.  That's why I 'm giving you 
advice:  Please tell your children everything, answer all of the

questions or ask your parents, so that  later on after t hey have 
passed away you know all of the history.  The thing is, after we 
came t o the United States, you know,  nobody really
 -- 
I' m 
changing t he t opic but I t hink it f its in well.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  It  fit s in.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Nobody really wanted to t alk about  it .  

Everybody put it under t he rug.  The Jews didn't  want t o t alk about 
i
t, because it was such a horrible experience.  The Germans didn't 
want to t alk about it,  because t hey were the perpet rat ors.  The 
rest of  the world didn't  want to talk about it, because they didn't  do 
anything.   So everything was under the rug.  
 
 
It wasn't unt il like 1993, like when t his museum was built, is 
when the Jews were coming out.  The thing is why are t hey doing 
all of t his?  Why are we talking so much about the Holocaust?  It  
had nothing to do with you,  not hing to do with you or you, but it 
does,
 
because we have to

well, I 'll talk about it lat er.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, you now know that your parents,  they're

old brot her.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah.  We got onto a boat called the Serpa 

Pint o.  There were 50 children allowed into t he United States.  
Somehow or ot her they had f ound passage to get here.  It was not 
like a grand cruise ship t he way we have
 
now.  It was a cruise 
ship, but it was small,  because they didn't have the big ones.  We

were not  allowed to mix with the people on the cruise ship.   I don't  
know what kind of
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  A Portuguese ship?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yes.   It was Por
tuguese.  But t hey were 
Americans on t his ship.   I  don't  know.  We never talked t o them.  
 
 
Anyway,  so we had to be in t he hull at the front of  the ship, 
and we were in the hull, and all 50 of us were in this one room.   

We had bunk beds and
 -- 
well, my bro
ther is going t o get mad at 
me if I tell you this.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  You got to tell though.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  So he was
 -- 
I was sleeping on the bottom, 
he was sleeping on the t op.  I don't think anybody was on the t hird 
bunk.  He had always been nervous, because he used to wet  his 
bed.   So this is
 
--
 
we switched, I got on top, he got on t he bottom.  
I'm telling you this for a reason.  He found a stash of pineapple 

that the boat was carrying.  It was not too far from where we were,  
where t he room was, and we had never eat en any pineapple 
before in our ent ire life.  He felt that that  was t he most delicious 
thing.  So he kept  on eating pineapple and pineapple, unt il he got 
really sick on the boat .  The boat ride was 14 days.  The boat  kept 

38

going up and down,  up and down, and somet imes the insides of 
his abdomen came swishing over the railing of  the boat  into the 
deep waves.  He was sick a lot.  
 
 
So then he went and he wet his bed, and he got a rash.  A 
rash all over his t orso, from here to here.  It was
 
really serious, but  
nobody did anyt hing about it.  I'm just telling you this f or a reason.  
 
 
So 14 days were up,  and they said it's 6:00 in the morning, 
we were going t o see the Statue of Liberty.  So we were all very 

excit ed.   My brother was already up 
t here the whole night wait ing 
for it t o come.  So we got  up there, maybe a litt le bit before 6:00.  
There was a fog.  You could not see your hand in front of your 
face.  It was so terrible.   It was really terrible, and we were all very 
upset.  
 
 
We stayed 
up t here.  I'm telling you,  I 'm not making t his up, 
at  6: 00, at exactly 6:00, the fog rose just like the curt ain in t he 
theater or when you go t o the opera, the curt ain rose and t here 
was the St atue of Libert y, right  next t o us.  It  was the most exciting 
e
xperience that I can remember from that  time.  
 
 
So we got to New
 
York, and t hey had a doct or, doctors 
came onboard to check us out.  All of the other people got off.  All 

39

the doct ors came
 -- 
no, two doctors.  Maybe t hree, I don't  know.   
They came onboard,
 
and they checked out.  They checked to see 
if we had some kind of infect ious disease.  So t hey got to my 
brot her, and they said, " This person has some kind of disease t hat 
we do not understand what  it 's all about ."   So they said, "You can't 
come into t he 
United States. "  
 
 
So where do you t hink they put him?  Ellis Island is right.  
You guys are so smart .  
 
[Laughter]
 
They said,  " You have t o go t o Ellis Island. "  Of course, I wouldn't 
let  him go by himself.  I went wit h him.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parents
 
are on shore somewhere?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yes,  my father.  And so I  guess he f ound 
out what was going on.  So we went  to Ellis I sland and I t ried to 
explain to t hem what it was.  I had tried to explain to t he doctors 
what it  was, but  they wouldn't li
sten to me.  
 
 
So that was t he best place I had been in a long time, Ellis 
Island.  I tell you.  We sat on these long tables, and on the t ables 
there were these round plates with stacks of white bread.  It was 
this high, and t hey had like six or seven slic
es.   You could eat as 

40

much as you want.  If you wanted to hold one in your hand,  you 
could take it and you could squish it up in your hand and make a 
lit tle ball out of it.  We thought that was so exciting.   We found out 
lat er on that  it was called Wonder Bread.   
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Candy that you could chew all day?  Right?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah.  We found out kids had candy you 
could chew all day.  What do you t hink it  was?  Chewing gum.  
Yes.  
 
[Laughter]
 
Then also t here was a sailor sitt ing next  to my brother, who 

of fered my brot her a drink.  Here you are,  these litt le kids, I  wasn't 
quit e sure whet her my brot her should drink t his drink.  It  was 
brown,  it had bubbles in it .  The sailor said, " Oh,  it 's OK.  It's OK."  
My brother drank it.  He liked it a lot.   The sailor said, "I t is 
Coca
-
Cola."  
 
[Laughter]
 
So it  was a wonderful experience.   
 
 
Anyway,  his rash subsided, and we came onshore and my 
father was there waiting for us.

>> Bill Benson:  Do you recall your reunion with your parent s
, 
what that  was like for you?  I t was a hard adjust ment at times, 
wasn't  it?  Once you got settled you had t o go to, I think it  was 
called,  Americanization school.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes.  
 

>>
 
Bill Benson:  What was your adjustment like here in the Unit ed 
St ates?  Got just a f ew minut es.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  Oh, OK.  I'm talking too much.  I'm sorry.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  It 's your day.   You get to talk a lot , yeah.   
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   I t was
 
difficult.  At first we had to go to 
Americanizat ion school and learn how to speak English.  Then we 

went to school,  and they put me in t he 7B1.  I  don't know why they 
put me in 7B1, but I couldn't believe what was in t hat class.  
Nobody paid attention to
 
the t eacher, and nobody did their 
homework.   Kids were looking out  the window,  t hey were chewing 

gum.  I couldn't underst and it,  because we had been very
 -- 
we 
always,  in France and in Germany, respected t he teacher a lot.  
 
 
Then I found out that I  was in 7B1 and t hat t hey had 
homogeneous grouping and all of the kids in my class were all of 

the dumb kids, and all of  the smart kids were in 7B7, and so the 

42

reason they put  me in 7B1, not  because I was dumb, but I didn't  
know how to speak English.  The t eacher really was not very 
understanding of any of my problems.  
 
 
They didn't  have any ESL teachers, t he way we do in school 
now.  In t he meantime, I  learned how to speak English,  so 
gradually I  got to 7B5,  but I never made it t o 7B7.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Bens
on:  I remember you telling me that  you just couldn't 
believe how bad American boys could be.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   I  feel sorry for the t eacher now, because I  
can underst and it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were a t eacher.  
 
>> Susan Warsinger
:  Yeah, we never have homogeneous 
grouping anymore.  We don't do that.  We have a het erogeneous 

grouping.  I can underst and the problems the t eacher had.  She 
certainly was not underst anding of any of my problems.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  What  did your father d o to get himself  settled and 

begin t o earn a living once he was here,  because he didn't speak 
English either when he came.  
 

43

>> Susan Warsinger:  Yeah, he did.  What  did he do at the 
beginning?  Oh, yeah,  he got t ogether wit h some farmer who had 
chickens, 
and he bought eggs f rom the farmer, and he brought 
them home, he had this litt le machine.  You put the egg in the 

machine and there's a light.  You call it candling.  You looked to 
make sure there are no bloodst ains in t here.  Then he put them 
int o separate containers, t hen he sold it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  He went  door to door selling the eggs?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  To t he Jewish people in the communit y in 
Washington.  We went straight t o Washington.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Washingt on, DC, right here.  
 
>> Susan 
Warsinger:   Yeah.  You know why?  Remember t he 
rabbi t hat I  told you got his beard cut?  He ended up in 

Washington, so my fat her always looked up to him, because he 
was the wise man of  the town.  So he said,  " If Washingt on is good 
enough f or the rabbi, it must be good enough f or my family."  So 
that 's how we got  to
 -- 
>> Bill Benson:  You stayed lifelong friends with the rabbi and his 
f amily,  right?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Yes, right.

>> Bill Benson:  When did you learn about  the rest of your 
ext ended f am
ily?  
 
>> Susan Warsinger:   Well,  I didn't learn about what
 -- 
I f ound out .  
I f ound out  about the ghet tos and t he concentrat ion camps when 
everybody else found out in t he United St ates.  But I did not
 
--
 
then after a while, you know,  we had t he Red Cross,
 
who had all 
of  these records, and you could find out what  happened to your 
relatives.  
 
 
Well, I  checked it all out, and on my mot her's side they all 
went to concentration camps and they died in Riga.  My f ather's 
family, they were Polish, t hen you could probably learn that  if you 
go t o another exhibit, what  they did to the Polish Jews.  There was 
father Dubois who went around t o all of these little villages to find 
out what happened to the Jews, because there was no record of  
them.  He found out  from the 
people that  were living in the town 
that when the Nazis came int o t heir little town, they made all of  the 

people go int o the woods, dig graves, and then t hey shot t hem.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did any ot her family members survive from your 

family?  
 
>> Susan Wa
rsinger:  No.

you want t o do.   Please feel free to do t hat.  
 
 
I'm going to t urn back to Susan t o close our program.   I  
know I  wish we had another hour wit h her t o go deeper into some 
of
 
the t hings she shared with us and other things we didn't get t o.  
But really, I t hank you, Susan, f or being here.  I  t hank all of  you.  I 

want t o remind
-- 
[Applause]
 
I want  to remind you t hat we'll have programs each Wednesday 

and Thursday unt il August  15, then we'll be finished f or 2013.  But  
we'll resume again in 2014.  So I hope you can come back.  If not

It 's our t radit ion at

>> Susan Warsinger:  I know you were going t o ask me that , so I  
wrote it down,  because I didn't want t o forget anything.   So I hope 
you don't  mind if I read it t o you inst ead of just talk.  
 
 
I want  my children, my grandchildren and my future 
great
-
grandchildren, my brothers and their f amilies, my friends 
and the visit ors here in the audience to rejoice in the fact that we 

are living in a democratic society and that  we should be resolut e 
in making sure that no dictat orship would ever usurp our liberties.  
 
 
What do we have to do?  We need t o remember the 
at rocities t hat happened to f amilies during the Holocaust and pass 
this inf ormation on to our progeny.  But besides remembering,  we 
have to take action to confront  hat e.
  
Just as our museum st rives 
to mot ivate cit izens and leaders to overcome indifference and 

work to protect  free societ ies and prevent  future genocides, we as 
individuals have t o do the same.  We have to t ake care of each 
ot her, and what  we do matt ers.  
 
 N
ow,  why do I work in t his museum, people ask me.  How 
can you do this over and over?  How can I not do it?  Explaining 
what happened during the Holocaust, to our visit ors, law 
enforcement of ficers, FBI agents and students of  all ages,  that I

tour through t
he permanent exhibit , hopef ully teaches them t hat 
part of our hist ory so that they will apply it to t hemselves and 
become bett er police off icers, fut ure leaders, and informed 
citizens.  
 
 
Hopef ully, it will t each t hem that they should never just be 
onlooke
rs when t hey see injustice occurring in their lives.   
 
 
When you visit the permanent exhibit , you will understand 
that my part of the story takes place on the f ourt h f loor.  Be sure t o 

look at the exhibit that is near the beginning, on the fourth floor, 
th
at discusses t he boycot ting of st ores.   Also take a look at t he 
propaganda section.  The young st udent s are reading a book 

called " The Poison Mushroom."  This is where lit tle kids are 
learning that  a Jew is a poison mushroom.  
 
 
Look f or the Jewish respons
es.   Look for the avian 
conference and especially the part about t he Night of Broken 
Glass.  
 
 
Also, look at t he voyage of  the St.
 
Louis.  This ship looks 
just like the Serpa Pinto that I was on.  And please also visit our 
new exhibit  Some Were Neighbors: Collaboration and Complicity

in t he Holocaust.   One of my colleagues is giving a tour at 2: 00.  
Let's see, af ter this if you rush out the door you might catch that.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Out  to t he right, yeah.   
 
>> Susan Warsinger:  At the top of the steps, 
you go right .  He's a very good t our 
guide.  That is a very unique exhibit , because it t alks about why and how t he Holocaust 
happened instead of what  happened.   You might want t o do t hat.  He's going t o give it 

again at 3: 00.  I f I have t he time, I'm going
 
to t ake a couple of my f riends through it in 
between.   So anyway, you might want  to do t hat.  
 
 
I hope that  you have a good learning experience.   I want to thank Bill Benson for 
helping me t ell my story, and I want to thank the audience for coming to our 
museum 

and being wit nesses t o the history of the Holocaust  and f or listening to my story.
