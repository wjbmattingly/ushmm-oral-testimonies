my  father was born in 
Poland
. They got married in 1914
, I think, and because my  
mother was German, my father was Polish bor
n, they -- for some reason they could 
not get married in 
Germany
, so th ey had to go to  -- th

, which was in 
Czechoslovakia
, and they were bo
rn -- they were 
married there. I found this out only mu ch later.

Germany

Germany
 it was 
not called Reform, it was called Li
beral, and Liberal was not as
 liberal as in -- as in 
this -- Reform was not as reformed as in 
America
. It was a little less reformed. For

 Reformed service. 
But -- but -- but the 
sexes were separated.

in the different classro o m for these lessons. 
Q: So yo-you went to what
 we would call a public school, today. What was the 
name of your school? 

A: First I went to a private elementary 
school, and later on to -- to -- to a high 
school, which is called gymnasium in 
Germany
. I -- I got a humanistic education 
there. So the emphasis was on Latin, Greek 
and so on. Not only th e languages, but 

also we learned about culture of the ol

so on. There -- the 
history, geography and all that. 

Q: You said you lived in a mixed neighbor

 Jewish, but I had a number of Christian 
friends, too.

my parents worked 
in the business and the first fo ur or 
five years or so of my  childhood, I spen

Greek. Latin started me -- I had -- I had nine
 years of Latin, six years of Greek and

Q: Oh. 
[inaudible] 
A: And then of course Hebrew in -- in th

Q: Did you have a 
Bar Mitzvah

A: Yes. 

Q: Describe that. Ca
n you describe your 
Ba r Mitzvah
? 
A: My 
Bar Mitzvah
 was on 
R o sh  H a sh anah
, and I hated the idea that there was a 
full house, that I™d -- I was on 
th e bachelor™s side, so I didn™t like the idea that I had 
to do that in front of a full house. 
Q: But you -- you say 
you had a -- you were very mu si

able to do the chanti
ng without a problem? 
A: Yes, there was no problem in that respect, no. I chanted it all.

a celebration for you after 
the service? 

A: No, we -- we had a dinner in

Q: What were your favorite of aw  -- wh

your favorite authors? 

A: I guess th-the best known German aut
hors, and I don™t even rememb er which. 
There was one which was very
 popular at that time, 
Leon Ka lmay [indecipherable]
 
he was pronounced in 
Germany,
 
Kalmei. 
He wrote about American Indians and so  
on, and he wrote at least 25 
books of this type, and th-t
ha-that -- i-in my childhood 
was my  favorite author. 
Q: Any songs from childhood th
at you rememb er? Any songs? 
A: No. I -- I actually don™t remember the ki

And then, of course, we -- we knew some 
Je wish songs, which ar

country, too. 
Q: What were their names,

 Ha nuka h

any kind of physical activity?

A: I was very active in that respect.
 I loved to play soccer. Later, when
 Hitler
 came 
to power, all Jewish kids joined -- th-th-
they founded Jewish 
sports clubs because 
we were not allowed to be memb ers of others
. So that was also a social outlet for all 
Jewish kids. So I was very active there. F-
F-Field and track, and so ccer I played and 
I was -- I w a -- I was o n e of the socc -- so
ccer players on my team and we traveled 
every Sunday to -- to towns 
nearby and played games ther
e. I was v ery active as far 
as sports are concerned. And I was the -- one
 of the best athletes in si -- in high 
school, too. Was my  special ambition becaus
e being the only Jew 
in my class, I -- I 
excelled in that respect, and I knew that
 the Germans respected people who were 
physically active and successful. 

Q: How old were you when
 you started high school? 
A: I was 10 years old.  

Q: So from 10 to 
18 y-you were -- 
A: 19. 

Q: -- 19, you were active in sports. Did you have any id eas about a future career? 

A: No, I was not -- because the situation ch
anged all the time. When the rights were 
taken away from all Jews, I -- you had 
less possibilities and ch
ances t-to go to 
certain schools and universities. As 
a matter of fact, shortly after 
Hitler
 came to 
power, Jews could not go to colleges any more
, and universities. So I had to change 
my  professional plan s all the time .

Q: Anything else that you want

A: You mean before 
Hitler
 came to power? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: No. 

Q: Okay . What is -- okay, so it i -- you were 
18 years old -- or 17 
and a half when  he 
came into power. 

A: Yes. 

Q: What is your first recollection of 
Hitler
? 
A: My first recollectio n of 
Hitler
 is shortly after he came to power, there was a 
boycott of all Jewish stores, all over 
Germany
. That me -- it meant that storm 
troopers stood in  front of -- a couple of st
orm troopers stood in  front of all Jewish 
stores and stopped people 
from going in. The -- well, th
at lasted only a couple of 
days and then they discontinued that, but it 
made a deep impression on me that time. 
Q: Now, when he came 
into power, you were still in the gymnasium? 
A: Right. 

Q: And were there any changes in the 
beginning among your 
fellow students and 
among th e faculty when  he came in, in the beginning?

A: No, in  the beginning, hardly  any ch ange
s took place, this all happened later, very 
gradually. So that was one reason why we
 all thought it might 
end very suddenly 
again. We thought it couldn™t last, that 
Hitler
 would be thrown 
out again, and we 
thought it only for a short while. We couldn™
t believe that this would stay forever. 
But later on of course, it got more serious. 
Q: In the beginning, did you talk things
 over with your parents about the changes 
when
 Hitler
 came into power? Were 
they open with you?  
A: Oh yes. These were the only people you 
could talk with about things like them. 
We were always very careful to make remarks about 
Hitler
 in the Nazi time, so I 
spoke only to my
 -- mainly to my family about th is. Actually, my father was not 
alive any more when
 Hitler
 came to power. My fa
ther died in 1927. 
Q: Wh-W hat did he die from?  

A: He had a stroke, he was awa-away -- aw
ay  on vacation and he -- he died of a 
stroke. 

Q: So did your mo th er 
keep the business going? 
A: My mo th er kept the business, and her sist

to be help ful to her, and th is way

Q: Did you notice any changed attitudes on th

early to mi ddle 1933? 
A: In the beginning there was hardly any ch
ange in 1933, but 30 -- ™34, and shortly 
after that, it slowly changed. In the beginn
ing I was still very friendly with all of -- 
we were a class of 25, who stayed togeth
er by the way, until the nine years were 
over, so we -- we were always together. 
So I was still very friendly with most -- 

almost all of them. And then -- 

Q: This is boys and girls? 

A: Yes, boys and girls, right. And they 
kept on talking to me, we had friendly 
relations, but slowly they all joined the 
Hitler
 youth, the Nazi organization. And 
they didn™t stop talking to me, but they we
re -- they were still more distant. And 

slowly this changed to
o, for the worse.  
Q: What about your teachers? 

A: My teachers behaved all right. They
 didn™t show 
any anti-Semitism, even 
actually up to the end when -- when I left
. W h en I -- when I -- when high school was 
over. But I was banned from certain activ
ities in school. When
 they were in 
nationalistic celebratio ns or national holidays,
 in -- in which I always had taken part 
of before, we were
 banned from these thing -- I was banned from there, which I 
actually didn™t mind. I was very happy I didn™t have to take part.

A: Of course we didn™t like it at all and 
we felt -- we were looking forward to  the 
day -- it last five, six days. We were looki

In the beginning we were not actually afraid
 that something would happen to us, but 
I -- I know that a couple of Jewish people we
re beaten up on the street and insulted 
and that happened, by the way,
 in other ways, too. Slowly
, 1933 - ™34 - ™35, it got 
worse, and people were insulted on the st
reets. They called us dirty Jews and many 
times they -- they hit us,

came over to me and insulted me.

mo re. So I, be-being very mu ch interested
 in mu sic, I was looking fo r some activity 
for something to do 
in connection with music. An
-A nd I thought of becoming a 
cantor in the synagogue. There was a Jewish teacher™s college in 
Berlin
, and I asked 
a couple of my  -- we had some acquain tan
ces which were -- knew a lot about mu sic 
and s -- and voice and singing and so on. So
 I consulted so me of our friends, sang 
for them, and asked them if 
-- if t h ey thought my voice
 was good enough to  be a 
cantor. So I finally heard of s -- of
 the Jewish teacher™s college in
 Berlin.
 And -- so, 
in other words, I would have to be traine
d as a cantor and as a teach er, mainly as a 
teacher, of course. This was a teacher™s 
college, which specialized, of course, in 
Jewish education and public

and I was accepted and started in -- in spri

Berlin. 
Q: Was that hard for you to -- to leav

was she positive about your moving,
 or did sh e not want you to? 
A: Now, if she -- if she felt bad about it,
 she didn't let me k

sister was still there too, bu

the small town -- small city to 
Berlin

A: So, what is your question? 
Q: My question is, did you f-fe
el like you had to be the 
man in the family because 
there was no man there? 
A: No, actually not. At that time I was too yo
ung for that, at 12 years. I didn™t feel I 
had any responsibility in that
 respect. But there were my  uncles of -- there were two 
uncles of mine living in  
Fürth, 
too, who of course w -- tried to help my  mo ther 
manage things and so on. 

Q: So now you go off to 
Berlin
, an-and what was your experience there at this 
teacher™s college? 

A: It was very hard for me in the beginn
ing because I felt very lonesome. I didn™t 
know a soul in 
Berlin
, and -- but that™s -- got slowly 
used to it and I did pretty well 
in school there. I had some voice teache
rs, too. On e was one of the best known 
cantors in
 Berlin
. The other one was an opera singer at the 
Berlin 
opera. And they 
gi -- first o n e, then the other one gave me
 singing lessons, so I improved my  voice to 
a certain extent. 

Q: And their names? The cantor™s name and the singer™s name? 

A: The cantor™s name was 
Davidson
 and the -- the opera singer™s name was 
Relane 
Goodman
. He was pretty well known. 
Q: And so you -- you were w
ith all other Jewish students at the time, because this 
was a Jewish college.

A: Right, that was a Jewish college, right
. A Jewish teacher™s college. Half of it 
consisted of regular teacher™s cl-classes 
and teaching. The other half was Jewish 
education because we had to teach religion, t
oo. So I -- I -- a lot, a lot of Hebrew, of 
course, and everything connect
ed with the Jewish religion, customs and ceremonies. 
Some 
Talm ud
 s-studies we had too, just to give us a taste of it.

 B.
 
And you were talking about your expe
rience at this Jewish college in 
Berlin
. And 
all the students, of course, were Jewish. Wh
at was it like to study with only Jews, as 
opposed to your gymnasium experience? 

A: It, of course, was a pleasant experience 
to be together with Jewish kids all the 
time. In that respect, I liked it very much. 
We were very good friends to each other. 
Was a class of about 24 bor -- boys and girls. 

Q: I imagine you saw many swastikas 
and many flags hanging, not only in 
Fürth
, 
but of course in 
Berlin
. How did that make you feel, to see them?  
A: No I -- everybody got very f-fast used
 to that, it was something that you see 
everywhere, and you di -- after awhile you didn™t even  notice it any mo re.

A: The same thing, you got used to  that 
too. After awhile it didn™t bother you too 
much any more. 
Q: Any experiences on the st
reet when you were in 
Berlin
, if you were walking 
down  the street? Did you lo ok very  Jewish? 

A: Yeah, I -- I looked Jewish, of course. But 
in -- in the big city of four million, you 
di-disappeared in the crowd. And you coul
d do in -- in certain
 ways it was even 
better in 
Berlin
 than in 
Fürth
, because you could go to  th
e places here still. In 
Fürth 
you couldn™t even go to a swimming pool, or
 in -- all the -- in 
-- in the rest of 
Germany
 you couldn™t go to a swimming pool, to
 th eaters or movies or any place 
like this. In fir -- in 
Berlin
 you could do th at, because yo
u just disappeared in the 
crowd. You could ev en go to th e opera and to
 concerts. So in that respect, life in  
Berlin
 was easier than in 
Fürth.
 
Q: And how mu ch communicati
on did you have wi
th  your mo th er and your sister? 
A: I spoke to them on the 
telephone, I guess once a week. 
Q: And how were they  managing back in 
Fürth
? 
A: That -- it seems they managed all right 
without me, but business got worse at that 
point. Th-The longer 
Hitler
 was at pow -- in power, th
e worse economic conditions 
for Jews became. 

Q: And how did your mo ther
 support the family then?

A: There was still enough business just to
 barely support us, but it -- I know it was 
not easy for her to have me in 
Berlin
, of course. Did not help our financial situation. 
Q: Did you have to pay tu
ition to go to this college? 
A: Yes, I had to pay tuition there. 
Q: What -- and where did you liv
e when you were a student in 
Berlin
? 
A: I lived in a furnished room with a 
Jewish family, not far from our teacher™s 
college. 

Q: And what kind of 
experience was that? 
A: I had no special experiences in t -- I me
an, they were -- I was pr -- became pretty 
close to the family, which made 
it easy for me to be alone in 
Berlin
.  
Q: You had previously mentioned the 
Nuremberg
 rallies. Did you ever go to any of 
them, or hear them fro m a distance? 

A: No, you could not go. You -- you stayed  
away from them as far as you could. It 
never entered our minds to a -- to attend 
these things. You stay
ed away from -- from 
the -- these Nazi hordes as -- as
 much as you possibly could. 
Q: Any close Jewish friends that 
you could talk things over with? 

A: In
 Fürth,
 yes, but a -- a lot of them left 
Germany
, emigrated over the years. 
Everybody tried to get out of 
Germany
, of course. And this way it was not easier. 
On one hand you wanted to get out of 
Germany, 
on th e other hand you didn™t know 
where to go to -- and especially older peopl
e found it very difficult to leave, because

all -- they had all their roots in 
Germany
, their livelihoods, their friends, family. 
And for a young person, of course, it was 
easier to leave, unless you were -- of 
course, you -- you were very 
attached to your fami ly. 
Q: Did your fami ly have any contacts in the -- in the 
United States
 at that time? 
A: My mother had a cousin in -- in 
America
, in -- in 
York, Pennsylvania.
 He was a 
fairly wealthy man and he had vouched fo
r quite a few people already to come to 
America
, but wh en we asked him he couldn™t do it any mo re. He mu st have 
vouched for maybe 20 people, and wh en 
you reach a certain point, you couldn™t do 
it any mo re. So he had to say no to us in 
the beginning, but later on, for some reason 
he could do it again, and he asked -- he 
asked our family if they -- who -- who 
should -- he could vouch fo
r one mo re person, who should come. And because I was 
the only man in the family and mo re in dang
er of being persecuted by th e Nazis, so 
my family agreed to 
send -- to let me go. 
Q: We-We™ll get to that in 
a mo ment. You heard about the 
anschluss
 into -- into
 
Austria
, and -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- what did that mean to you? 

A: It didn™t mean much to me except I 
didn™t -- we didn™t like the idea that 
something like this could happen . We

countries might -- might be occu pied by 
Germany, 
which actually happened later 
on. We saw this the beginnin
g of something very bad. 
Q: Is that when you realized that wh
at was happening may not be temporary? 
A: That was the time when -- 
when most Jews realized  th
at things would not get any 
-- an-any better any more. Before we always thought
 Hitler™s
 regime might stop any 
moment it ca -- when it came to a certain poi
nt, and it would not get worse. At that 
time we realized we couldn™t stay. That™s
 when  people -- many people really started 
looking to get out seriously . Many, of cour
se, had left already in 1933, but these 
were the Jews who lived in very small 
towns, in villages, mostly in south 
Germany
 
and they were worse off than the Jews wh
o lived in b -- in the big cities, because 
everybody knew everybody and people were 
beaten up and sent to concen tration 
camps in these small place, much
 more than b -- in big citie
s, at that time. But after 
this happened at the 
anschluss
 and later on 
Kristallnacht, 
we came to the 
conclusion that there was 
no way of staying here. 
Q: What was your ex perience during 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: In the middle of the night we heard a lo
t of noise, at maybe two, three o™clock in 
the mo rning, and th e bra -- the breaking of
 glass. And then we looked out of the 
window, we saw that storm troopers marche
d all over the place a
nd knocked in store 
windows and went inside and th en they ca
me -- they went upstairs out -- in these 
houses an-a-and arrested all the Jewish pe
ople. An -- and that -- that happened with

each and every Jew in the whol
e place, and ha
ppened all over 
Germany
. And th en 
they -- they burned all synagogues. And I 
knew it -- I could see that our synagogue 
in 
Fürth 
was burning at the time, too. 
Q: Were you in 
Berlin
 or
 Fürth 
during 
Kristallnacht? 
A: I -- I was still in 
Fürth 
at that time. No, that was after I came back. 
Q: This is November 1938. 
A: I was back in 
Fürth 
already, th -- after my three years in
 Berlin
 when the kr -- 
Kristallnacht 
was November 9
th
, 1938, and th-th-they t -- th
ey took us all to a large 
square in the middle of the city and we 
had to stand there for five hours, men, 
women, children, everybody.
 Then they let women an
d children go home. The men 
were taken to a big hall, which had been
 donated by a Jew, by the way. And we 
spent all day in there. And they took men,
 took th em up to the stage an-and beat 
them. And we had to  watch it, we were s
itting undern eath, i-in
side the hall and we 
had to watch everything. And th at went on
 all day like this. And in the evening, 
about six, seven o™clock, we all had to pa
ss a certain table, and we were -- there th-
th-they decided wh at to do 
with us. So the ma
jority of the men were sent to 
concentration camps, and to prisons. My -- 
my future father-in-
law, for instance, 
was sent to pri -- was taken to pris
on and many other me n were taken to 
concentration camps. And when I -- when I passe

account of that they let me go. I was very
 lucky, cause I was able to go home. But 
the majority of the people did not. It™s --  
Q: Mm-hm. Le -- le-let™s back up a little b
it. You went to the 
teacher™s college in 
Berlin
 for three years? 
A: Right, yes, for three years. 

Q: And that -- and then you comp letedthe course, and then wh at happened? 

A: Then I wa -- I was trying to find a jo
b as a cantor teacher and I -- I had two 

auditions, I was in two cities in 
Germany
. And in  one place they didn™t take me 
because I was t -- they found
 me too young, they want
ed some -- so mebody who -- 
who was a little older. And in the -- in the 
second case I don™t know, they d-didn™t 

accept me. So I went home, then 
I realized that it -- it was 
better for me not to accept 
a job, and try -- rather, try to -- to speed up my  emigration. And th at was a good 

thing, because I know some of the others
 who accepted jobs as teachers never got 
out of 
Germany
. In that respect I was lucky. 
Q: And who did you work  thro
ugh to  get the papers? You said you had that relative 
who had already comp leted the 
20 affidavits -- i-in the 
United States

had a relative who had sponsored 20 peop

 I was invited to come to the 
American consulate in 
Stuttgart, 
and that was the beginning. An -And th en I tri -- I

 document, which sort of -- many -- in 
Germany
 when you moved, and thi -- it went 
for anybody, if 
you moved from one 
city or town  to another one, you had to 
get permission by police. And th at wa -- 
didn™t go only for Jewish 
people, for everybody as th
 -- might still be the same 
nowadays, I don™t know. So, and they told  me
 I needed a certain paper, a declaration 
that I didn™t owe any money to anybody or the taxes 
[indecipherable]
. And I wrote 
to 
Berlin
 because I had been there before, a-a
nd they -- I didn™t get an answer. So 
my  da -- emigration depended on -- on this
 document. And I wrote three times and 
never got an answer, so I decided I had to
 go there in person. So  I made a trip to
 
Berlin
 and I had to go to the 
Gestapo build ing, wh ich everybody dreaded at the 
time. Nobody wanted to go ther
e. So I went in, I -- I -- I 
met a -- an official there, 
and he yelled at me right away , he said, 
what™s the ma tter with you, are you crazy? 
You™re writing three letters to me? Do you 
think we have nothing better to do than 
that? I feel like sending you 
to a concen tration camp . And -- and then  he said a few 
more words I forgot, and then he let me
 go. Bu t I d -- I didn™t know whether it was 
okayed or not. About five days later I got
 the paper and -- and he -- I had asked for.

Q: And so did you fi

Fürth

A: No, in  -- in our own synagogue, in our
 Reform synagogue, I -- they engaged me 
as a cantor on th e high holiday s and shortly 
after. Our former -- our other cantor 
emigrated himself, and they didn™t have a ca

was the cantor in that -- in our 
home synagogue at that time. 
Q: And how was the family business doing then? 
A: The family busin ess got wo rse and wo
rse all the time. Of course, customers 
didn™t come to us, either b
ecause they were anti-Semitic, or
 because they were afraid 
to go into Jewish stores. 
So it -- it -- and another thing

 they forced them this wa

she had a-all the responsibility for me and 
my sister and the business. The business 
didn™t exist any more after that, but she -- sh

the way she did. Sh e had a lot of help by my  aunt, of course, and my  uncles.

family. Even I didn't k n ow at the time yet

Q: And you got to

 and got on what boat? 
A: It was a Dutch sh ip, 
Zaandan,
 
Z-a-a-n-d-a-n. 
There wa -- that was a ship 
belonging to  the hum -- to 
Holland America
 line; it was one of 
the smaller ships. 
Q: Did you know anybody als -- who was go

A: No, I befriended a young man from a town
 near ours. We be -- spent all our time

goodbye to each other 
and the same evening we both liv

of a sudden, of course.

A: It was very -- I was very much impressed when I saw
 New York
. I didn™t have to 
go to 
Ellis Island
, that was not in use any more at 
that time, and I was processed ou-
outside
 New York City, 
on the boat. An immigrati
on agent came on board -- an 
immigration inspector came on board and to ok 
care of our papers and ev erything, so 
I didn™t have to go to  
Ellis Island
 or any -- any other place like that. 
Q: Were there many other Jewish refugees like you on board? 
A: There were a few more, yes. And then, 
of course, this young man an -- whom I 

befriended. 

Q: So who were the other passengers? 

A: This I re -- I don™t reme mb er. I -- I -- 

Q: Di-Di-Did you stay among th e other Je

like you? 
A: Yeah, there were some others like me, but not -- not too many. Must have been 

regular travelers, people who do a lot of traveling. 

Q: Did you talk about your chil -- your

Jewish refugees?

I had relatives in 
New York
 who were supposed to pick
 me up from the boat, and I 
had trouble finding them, so I -- my -- I 
couldn't pay mu ch attention to anything 
else, but I finally found them, and they ha
d arranged for a -- a place for me to live. 
Q: They  had come down to  the pier to meet you? 

A: Right. They came -- they
 came to meet me at the 
boat and they  took me home. 
And they had fren -- rented a

a job as teacher because of my heavy Germ
an accent, so I never expected to find 
that. But as a cantor I had some hope. But it just happened that at
 that time all the 
European cantors arrived in 
New York City 
in those years, and then there was a lot 
of competition. And I -- I auditioned in 
a couple of places, in a couple of 
synagogues, but I guess the competition wa

kind of a job, and I -- I found job in  a de
partment store as a -- as a busboy. That™s 
Klein Union Square

 New York

 in the field hospital, and two weeks

that was before I was in milit

in the -- in a camp right outside 
New Yo rk City

Halloran
 Hospital on 
Staten Island

there because they had a lot 
of German prisoners, and I ha
d to work as an interrogat 
-- as a interpreter and I had to go around 
with nurses and docto rs, had to make the 
rounds when they saw th
e patients. They used me as an interpreter. 
Q: Who were the patients? 
Who were these patients? 
A: They were German prisoners from 
Africa

Nazis who were volunte

w -- being prisoners they changed their atti
tudes very much, were not so fanatical

 course, so was -- they very ni -- were

to go home almost 
every night to -- to 
Manhattan
, and I came  home at two, three 
o™clock in the morning, I was alw ays tired. Of
 course, I had to get up at 5:30 again. 

So there were a lot of empty beds. So I re
sted on th ese -- I slept on these beds, and I 
put these German soldiers in -- up as guards 
on both ends of the -- of -- of the room 
in case my own people came 
and checked on me. So they 
guarded my sleep. So I -- I 
-- I took advantage of them. 

Q: Had you changed your
 name at this point? 
A: Not at this point but later on when I wa
s in military intelligence, I was advised to 
change my name because my fa
mily was still supposed to be
 alive, or at least I did 
not know any different. I thou
ght I™m di -- in case I™d become a prisoner, it might be 
harmful for them or even for -- and for me

So within one day I re -- changed my  name

especially these German sold

Alsace
. We 
crossed the 
Rhine
 and then we went to south 
Germany
, but that was in the -- near 
the end of the war. As a matter of fact we
 came to the point wh en in terrogations of 
prisoners were -- was n o t even necessary 
any more. They cou -- they could not -- 
they didn™t need any more
 interrogations. It was -- it was nearing the end and 
everything moved so fast that it wasn™t 
necessary to get info
rmation from them. So 
they used me for different purposes. I was 
-- became a member of a task force, we 
had to interrogate pri -- civilians about cert
ain -- about Nazis, big Nazis. Where they 
were located and -- and factories where -- 
where they manufactured war materials, 
where they were trying
 to -- to build an 
A 
bomb  and things like 
that. They were all 
secret targets which we had to visit. So we 
-- we tr -- we traveled around in teams of 
six each and o-of course I had to interpre
t for y -- for the officers who -- who -- who 
questioned these people. Oh, I did some of
 -- some of my  own interrogating, too.

actually belonged to the big concentrati

were small camps, strictly fo

 of them were all Jewish. 
So I -- in -- in two cases I was the first 
Jewish American soldier who -- who entered 
them. And they were very happy
 to see me. I tol -- I told

Jewish. In one camp I reme mb er they -- th

anything I could for them. By

ny of the details are c-coming back. 
A: What did you -- 
Q: And you said you wanted -- you wanted to
 tell them the fuller story, that many of 
the details have come back to you. 

A: The reason for my -- for writing my memo

story of my past. It was the main reason why I did this. 

Q: Why is that important?  

A: I think it™s very important that they 
know what happened to me. In a way I felt it

happened  to me, and my  experiences and wh at
 I saw in my  life. It mu st have had a

Germany
 fo r six years certainly mu st have done a lot to me 
which ma -- otherwise would not -- would 
not have done anythi
ng. Would not have 
happened . 
Q: Did it make you more fearful? 

A: In the beginning, yes. It did make me 
more fearful. When we
 ca -- when I came 
here, and my wife told me the same -- th
at happened to  many German refugees who 
came at that time, we didn™t 
even speak loud. We were -- 
were not used to speaking 
th -- in the normal way. We wh ispered. And 
th -- and this went on for quite awhile 
and it took me a long time and I™m sure 
it must have happened to  others, too. 
Q: Because you didn™t want other people 
to hear you sp eaking German, is that it? 
A: No, because we were
 always afraid in 
Germany
 to sp eak loud, that Nazis didn™t 
hear what we were talking -- saying to each
 other. So we got used to s -- to speaking 
very softly. Now one thing I would like to 
tell you in that respect. My daughter 
complained to us when she 
was an adult already that sh
e -- she was influenced very 
mu ch by our behavior. She 
-- she -- she must have felt how sad we were and she 
feels that this influenced he
r life very mu ch so. And later on we asked our son i-if he 
had the same experience and he said no, be
cause this was already six years later and 
he was not so mu -- we were not as much 
influenced by our past
 any mo re six years 
later, than she was. 

Q: And how did that affect her?

 had no ex tended relatives? 
A: They know -- they know 
why. They  never -- they ne
ver knew what it means to 
have a -- a grandparent, for instance. 
Q: How old were they when  you expl
ained wh at really happened to them? 
A: Certainly not -- not too early. They mu st 
have been in their teens by that time, or 
maybe a little earlier w h en 
we told them all that. 
Q: And how did they ta
ke that knowledge? 
A: They took it as a matter of fact. I mean, 
they -- they took it 
as a fact. They met 
some other people, the -- older people wh
o took the place of their grandparents. 
They  became grandparent figures for them, and th ey almo st considered them as 
grandparents. 
Q: Were these other German refugees? 

A: Yes, they were, yes. 

Q: So when you and your wife were starti
ng out in life together, were your friends 
other German refugees, or Americans?
 Who did you s-spend your time with? 
A: They were mostly -- they
 were mostly German refugees too, in our earlier years. 
Later on of course, this was different. No
w our fre -- we have mixed friends, all 
types, but at that time, we

have been invited to go back to 
their hometowns by -- by th e -- by the city
 governments of these places, and ma ny 
did go back, and my  wife would never go

either, but I™m not as strict about this as
 my  wife is. I feel this -- it™s three

Q: Did you have any close non-Jewish fri

t him when I -- when I went back to

Germany
, through 
Nazism, losing your family and so forth, and 
other Jews in the -- for instance, in this

 but it -- it frustrate
s me so me ti mes th at 
American Jews don™t seem to understand

time, I co -- I don™t understand that yo
u German Jews didn™t -- didn™t go to  the 
nearest gun store, bought yourself a rifl
e or a gun and defe

known what went on, and what the circumst

 I had shot a -- a -- a German that time, 
they -- they wo -- they -- fi -- 10 minutes

it doesn™t matter to me an y 
more who my friends are, whom I™m together
 with, as far as that is concerned. But 
there was a time, a period when I was mo
re comfortable with German refugees. 
Q: Why? 
A: They were -- they were the people I 
knew, I -- I grew up with and who had the 
same experiences, whom I had a lot 
of common with -- in common with. 
Q: If you met somebody today and that 
person said where are you -- you know, 
where were you born , where did you co me 
from, how mu ch of your story would you 

tell to a s -- a new person? 

A: The same things I -- just the story as it happened, comp letely. 

Q: Do you feel this 
need to tell others? 
A: Yes, more so in my late
r years now than I did earl -- 
before. I feel there™s a n eed 
to -- to tell my  story and our story. 

Q: Wh-Why is that? 

A: Because I s -- I see that if it -- if this 
as a story is not told, it might happen again. 
It might be a way of preventing a future 
Hitler
 from appearing. 
Q: Do you think that™s possible? 
That there could be a future 
Hitler
? 
A: Personally, I™m an optimist, I don™t thi
nk so . Bu t I would not say it™s impossible. 
Q: Do you think there coul
d be one in this country ? 
A: I don™t think so.

Q: Because? 
A: Having seen Americans, having observ
ed Americans in -- 
all the time, I don™t 
think they have it in th

Q: With what happened on September 11
th
 this year, did that trigger anything for 
you? The destruction, the loss of life? 
A: No, I never b -- I never brought it in
 connection with what™s happened  in 
Germany
. I don™t think that ever entered my  mind. 
Q: I was thinking the destruction, the loss of life. 

A: N-No, I never -- I never saw a
ny connection with -- with Nazism. 
Q: When  you hear about a man like 
Osama Bin Laden
, does that make you think of
 
Hitler
? 
A: Frankly, I -- I never did. 

Q: When you™re -- do you think in German
? When  you™re thinking to yourself do 
you think in  German or in English? 

A: I™m -- I™m not sure. I don™
t think so. I don™t think so. 
Q: And you and your wife converse in?  

A: Mostly in  English. I would say 
80 percent -- 80 percen t in English. 
Q: Did you teach your children German? 

A: No. My daughter was more ex posed to 
some German  because she™s older and at 
that time maybe we spoke more German th
an w -- than we did later on. So she

it, but she doesn™t speak any. 
My daughter also mad e the stat
ement that she would never go to  
Germany
. 
Q: And what reasons does she give? 
A: I guess after all she heard from us, she acquired that attitude. 

Q: And how d -- how -- how do
 you handle this with you
r grandchildren wh en they 
question you, how -- wh -what are the -- wh
at is the age range of your -- your 

grandchildren? 

A: My grandchildren ra-range from 11 to 31.  

Q: Mm-hm. And so when they were yo
unger, and they woul
d ask you questions, 
what -- how would you re
spond about your family?  
A: They  didn™t ask me too many questions
, I must say. I mean, of course I 
volunteered many things, they didn™t have 
to ask me. But actually, they never asked 
me any -- hardly asked me any questions 
about -- that™s one of the reasons why I 
think it™s important that I write my memoirs. 

Q: Mm-hm. And your children then explai
ned to their children what you and your 
wife had -- have been  through? 

A: Frankly I d -- I don™t know that. I don™

subject.

Q: I-I wanted to talk about your 
experience at the museum itself. 
A: Oh, yes. 

Q: What was your first encounter with th

the beginning? 

A: I heard about it right away
 when I came to -- no, when I came h ere there was no 
Holo caust Museum yet. I was looking for 
some volunteer work I could do, and I 
couldn™t think of nothing -- I could thin
k of nothing better than the Holo caust 
Museum. 

Q: So you -- you -- you st
arted working with them af

A: Yes, right. I must have started f-four ye

you know what I™m doing? I™m
 do -- making translations. 

Q: I wanted you to explain what you™re doing. 

A: Yes. I™m translating Ge

cuments, collections of 
letters, all kinds of p-political, military doc
um -- whatever. Whatev
er they give me 
to translate. I™m surprised 
that now, after 60 years almo
st after the end of the war, 
that they are still -- there™s 
still more available. I expected
 three years ago that they 
wouldn™t have any more work for me, but
 it seems they do. They get a lot of 
collections now. Letter collections. Letters

asked the Holo caust Museum to have 
them translated. 
Q: So you™re not translating German 
military documents or
 anything like that? 
You™re doing personal -- 

A: It™s not military -- 

Q: -- Jewish -- Jewish letters. 

A: --

documents. Orders which were given by
 the German militar

population, let™s say in 
Poland
, what to do with the 
Jews, things like that. 
Q: And how do you keep your
self going when you read -- when you translate these 
things, it™s -- is it painful? 

A: I-In many cases it™s pai -- it is painful.
 There are many nights
 when I cannot fall

Q: Wha-What kind of

A: Now, I have a -- I-I understand many

people felt about certain situ
ations, especially  in these collections of letters. Ma -- 
for instance, parents whose children left 
Germany
 and th ey -- and the parents were 
still caught up in  germ -- caught in 
Germany
. And I could understand very  well 
how these -- how the parents felt, first a
bout not being able to get out any mo re. 
Numb er two about feeling left behind. 

Q: So you are translating these German
 letters from both the children and the 
parents? 

A: Or in some cases from the German fra 
-- from the parents, and some cases from 
the chil -- but mostly -- mostly 
ger -- parents to the children. 
Q: Wh-Who are writing to  their children in the

 in German?

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Fred Gold ma n
. This is tape number three, side
 
A.
 And we were talking about
 your work as a volunteer at the mu seum and -- and 
why you do it and the lessons that have be
en  learned. Is there anything else you 
want to add to that? 

A: Lessons which I™ve learned by 
working in the Ho
lo cau s t M u seum?  
Q: Yes. 

A: I was very happy to see that so ma
ny people, looking at the nu -- large numbers 
of volunteers there, very happy to see that
 people are interested in it. People who -- 
who do not come from 
Europe
, who are -- maybe less motive -- must be less 
motivated than I am, but that 
still a lot of people have inte
rest in this kind of work. 
Q: What -- what is your relationship with 
the other volunteers who are survivors or 
witnesses to the Holocaust? Do you ha
ve a special relationship with them? 
A: No, I don™t think I have a special relati
onship with them. I me
et a lot of them, I 

am a member of the surviv
or™s group, and that™s when I -- when I meet them 

sometimes wa -- once a month. And I™m very 
happy to  see there are so many in this 

group. I never considered my self a surviv
or, not having been in th e concentration 
camp. Originally I though
t surv ivors are only people who went through a 
concentration camp and are survivors of co
ncentration camps. But I am not, and the

 position. But it seems we are -- we are 
considered survivors in 
-- like in my case having
 lived in -- in Nazi 
Germany
 for six 
years. 
Q: And having to escape to -- t -- having to  es
cape to save your life, and then  having 

lost all of your family. 

A: Right, yes, yeah. 

Q: Wha-Wh at is your relationship to the vo
lunteers at the mu seum who are not from 
Euro pe
, who are not survivors and refugees? 
A: The same thing. The same relationshi
p as with these sur-sur-survivors. Very 
friendly with  quite a numb er of them. 
And I™d like to meet
 them, I™m looking 
forward to -- to every session there, every week when I go there. 
Q: What do you feel like wh en you walk in to
 the building? Do  you 
feel like this is a 
part of you? What -- what -- what are your 
thoughts wh en you put 
your foot over the 
threshold? 
A: Yeah, it™s a very important part of my
 life by now. I -- I feel th at I™m do -- doing 
important work and I -- for that reason 
I™m looking forw ard to going th ere every 
week. 

Q: As opposed to walking into another gov
ernment building, let™s say, why is that 
build ing different than another Federal building? 

A: Because it has a lot more mean ing to
 me than other government buildings.

Q: What -- what kind of meaning? What 
kind of meaning does it have to you, does 
that building represent to you? 
A: I feel it -- it -- it™s v ery important 
to me. More important to a -- to other 
government buildings, because of my fate
 an d of what™s happened to me. And 
because I™m becoming more and more convinced that it™s very  important to ha -- to -

- to have the Holocaust Museum. I™m surpri
sed to see there™s a -- so many non-Jews 
are going there. To me it looks bi -- looking 
around, I have the feeling that 80 to 85 

percent of the people who come there are 
non-Jews, and I™m very happy to see that 
they seem to be interested. Of course, th
ey don™t come all -- they don™t all come on 
their own account, they come besa -- beca
use they™re being sent by I don™t know 

whom. 
Q: Is it appropriate that th
ere is this building in the 
United States,
 in
 Wa sh ingto n
? 
A: Definitely. It™s very important. They
 should have mo re Holocaust mu seums in 
the rest of the country. There should be 
more -- more of them. Like in new yor --
 
in
 
New York
 
City
, they -- they have some kind of a Holo caust mu seum, but it -- it™s 
not what this one is. Th -- like 
th-the new one they have in 
New York
 is only -- only 
part of it is Holocaust museum, the rest 
is jew -- Jewish mu seum. I understand only 
one floor there is u -- b eing used for that purpose, right?

Ya d Va shem 
in is -- in
 Israel?

too. Bu t of course, the 
Washin gton
 mem --  memo rial  h o l  
-- Holocaust Museum is 
better for the purpose it is supposed to be. 
It™s a -- it™s more 
technically advanced , 
whatever they show, than what I saw that time in 
Yad Vashem
. So  people mu st be 
more impressed with what they see. 
Q: Have you had any very 
powerful experiences or me morable experiences when 
you™re wo rking there? You did mention how 
when you read letters from people who 
were left behind that that was very t
ouching. Any other memo
rable experiences you 
can talk about? 

A: No, I don™t think so. I know many people
 -- many other people did, but I can not 
remember of any case that I was es
pecially impressed by something. 
Q: Are -- is there -- are there any particular 
parts of the museum, or the exhibits with 
which you id entify, when you™ve gone thro
ugh the exhibit? Do you see anything that 
really touches you personally? 

A: That one big room where all the -- 
where the -- where children express their 
thoughts about the -- about 
the Holocaust. What -- what do you call that place? 
Q: You™re talking about the tile
s, the room with the tiles? 
A: The tiles, right, yes. They impress me ve
ry much and I go there very often to look 
at these tiles. Some of them are ex cellent 
of these tiles. They  tell you a lot. It also 
shows how children, espe -- 
especially children react to these events. What means

more to them than to other people and -- and 
so on. I think that™s 
an excellent idea to 
have these on -- on -- so prominently displayed as they are. 
Q: In the permanent exhibit, wa -- 
in the beginning when
 it shows life in 
Germany
 
and then the increasing restrictio ns that
 were imposed on the Jews -- do you know 
what I mean, in the -- on the top floor, on 
the fourth floor, when
 you read this, does 
it bring it all back to you, what you lived through in the 30™s? 

Q: Yeah, it certainly brings everything back
 to me. I had the same experiences. But 
of course, in my  case it™s a long time. 
That was 60 years ago or mo re, so maybe 
these impressions were not too strong i-in
 me any more. But now, of course, this -- 
this all reminds me very 
much of what
™s happened. 
Q: So you feel as you™ve gotten older a
nd fo r -- farther removed in  time, it does 
make a difference? 

A: Yes. It certainly brings it back mu ch 
-- much better. When I see these things I -- I 
notice that I had forgotten many things wh ic
h happened that time 
to me and to th -- 
to the other Jewish people and which slow
ly  dimin i sh ed  in  my  -- in  my  memo r y . 
This brings it back again, very much. 

Q: Did you have to change your name to 
Israel
 or add your name
 Israel
 to your 
papers?

A: There were so man y  other th-things, 
and worse things whic

that time, that it didn™t make any particul
ar impression on me. I considered it mo re 
as a nuisance, I think, at the time when
 it happened . Seeing -- with  all the other 
things hap -- happening to us, that was only a small part. 
Comparively
 -- a small 
nuisance comp ared to many other things wh
ich happened which were much worse at 
that time. 

Q: How did your sist

Sara h 
to  her name? 
A: Frankly, I don™t rememb er that. 
I don™t think we ever discussed it. 

Q: Do you receive reparations from 
Germany
? 
A: Yes, I do. I got restitution for a number 
of things. For the lo

our house, our busin ess and 
i-interruption of our educa

didn™t amount to mu ch  money. And fo r many things I didn't get anything at all. For 

instance, the value of our -- our stock 
in th -- in our bu
siness, you know. 
Q: Did it take a long time to receive it? 

A: Yes, it was very difficult, very hard. It 
had something to do w
ith the fact that our 
-- my lawyer was not very efficient, I thi
nk. He was -- I guess he was too old at the 
time. For every letter I -- I wrot
