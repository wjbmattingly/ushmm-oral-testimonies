First Per s on
, S us a
n War s inger .
 
> >  [Applaus e]
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  So, as  I m entioned, your  early years  were in Bad Kreuznac h, in Ger many. But 
before we get to the war  years , c an you tell us  a little bit about what your fam ily life was  like befor e the 
war?
 
> > Susan Wars inger:
  
Yeah.Well, Hitler c am e into power  in 1933 and I was  4 years old at the time. My 
father had a ver y thr iving stor e. He had a linen store. He made a very nic e liv ing. We lived in a very 

nic e hous e. But all of a sudden he didn't have his  s tor e anymore.
 
>> K
yr a Sc hus ter: Why was  that?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, at that partic ular time ther e was  the law in Germany. It was n't really a law 

yet but what happened is the Nazis  said boyc ott the J ewis h s tor es and then they won't be able to make 
a living anym or e. And
 
s o this  is what happened to my father. Mos t of the people in Bad Kr euznac h 
didn't s hop in his  s tore anym or e and eventually he los t his bus ines s . And this  was  r eally happening 
later on, I found out, happening to a lot of J ews  that wer e living in Germ any. W
hatever bus ines s  they 
were in, they wer e boycotted.
 
 
I was  just going to ask  the audienc e
 
--
 
how m any of you have been in the P.E. alr eady?
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  The Perm anent Exhibition ups tair s. Rais e your  hand.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Oh.Well, how m any are g
oing to go after wards ?  Oh, good. 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Susan Wars inger: 
Any way, s o what I'd like for you to look for when you firs t get up on the fourth 
floor, ther e's an exhibit with the S.A. s oldier s tanding in front of a s tor e and he's  boyc otting the store
. In 
that partic ular  exhibit, it's talking exac tly what happened to m y father 's s tore.
 

> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  How did your  father support the family if his bus ines s  was  c los ed?  What did you do 
for food or for m oney to pay for things ? 
 

> > Susan Wars inger:  Wel
l, I think he went to a far mer  and he bought s tr awberr ies  and r aspber ries 
fr om  him. I r em em ber  he had thes e baskets this  size. He c ar ried the baskets . He s old them to the 

J ewis h people that wer e in our town. So that's  how he made his  living, s elling ber rie
s.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  So ther e was  an inc ident you told m e about when you were little about your m other 

s ent you 
to 
the store to buy br ead for the fam ily. Can you tell us  about that? 
 

3 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. I was  feeling very im portant bec aus e I was  ju
st a little kid. I think I was 
m aybe 5 year s  old. And s he us ed to put the [Indis c ernible] in m y hand.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  The cur r enc y.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly. I had to go thr ough a park. It was  s imilar
 
--
 
say this is  my hous e, this  
s tage is my hous e,
 
and all in the audienc e here is  a park
 i
n Bad Kreuznac h. And on the other s ide 
wher e the c lock  is  and wher e everybody c ame in, where the s tor es  were. So in or der  for m e to get to 

the groc er y stor e, there wer e s ome steps and I could just walk thr ough the p
ark , get to the other  s ide, 
and go to the store and com e back .
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  A s hor tc ut.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly. So I did it. And one day when I was  doing it, the gatekeeper
 
--
 
ther e was  
a gatekeeper  in this  park . He s tarted s c r eam ing at me. And he s aid, "You c an't walk thr ough this  park 
anym or e." He s aid als o
 
--
 
c alled me all kinds of nam es . I was  this  little kid. I didn't unders tand what was  
happening. And he als o s aid, "You can't walk thr ough this  park  anym or e. Don't you dare." So I rushed 

hom e to m y m other and I told her. And s he s aid, well, don't walk through the park  anymore. They 
always  tr ied to protec t us. They didn't tell m y br other  and m e the prejudic e and hatr ed that was  going 
on bec aus e we didn't r eally under s tand it.
 
 
So the next tim e s he told me to go to the s tor e I got to the steps of the park  and I said to 
m ys elf
 
--
 
I was  really ver y tir ed. Gues s what I did.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  You cut through the park .
 
> > Susan War
s inger:  That's right. I s tar ted walking down. I didn't get through the park  but I started 
walking down the stair c as e. As s oon as  I start walking down the stair c as e, the gatekeeper c ame and 

not only did he s ay awful things  about J ewis h people but he starte
d to thr ow roc ks at m e, the rock s  that 
were on the ground. But the wors t part of it was  he had a daughter who was  jus t a little bit older than 

m e, m aybe, I don't know, m aybe as old as thes e two kids  are s itting over  there. And s he s aw what her 
father was  doing and s he s aid, well, he's m y father , he's m y r ole model, and s o s he started to c all me 
the s ame nam es that he had c alled m e and s tar ted to throw rocks  at m e. And her e this  little gir l was  
learning how to hate and have pr ejudic e agains t people. So I never  walked through the park again.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  So you were the oldest of thr ee.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Can you tell us  about the birth of your  baby brother ?  You were going to be a big 
s is ter again. And your  mother delivered the
 
baby at home.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes , s he did.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter : Why didn't s he jus t go to the hos pital?
 

> > SusanWars inger:  Well, m y br other and I
 
--
 
in the one pic ture you s aw my br other  and m e s itting on 
the steps.We were s itting outs ide of our hous e. At that time we had to m ove from one hous e to another 

bec aus e we c ouldn't affor d the hous e that we lived in. So the one that you s aw in the pic tur e before 
was  one of the last houses  wher e we were living.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Still in Bad Kr euznac h.
 
>> S
usanWar s inger:  Yes . It was  always  in Bad Kr euznac h, yes . She c ouldn't
 
--
 
we had to s it outs ide. 
She c ouldn't go to the hos pital to have the baby bec aus e ther e was  a law in Bad Kr euznac h that J ewis h 
people wer en't allowed to go to the hos pital.
 
>> Kyra Sc
hus ter:  So if anything went wr ong, s he was  at hom e. Was there anyone as s isting her? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  She didn't have a doctor and s he didn't have a m idwife but ther e was  s omebody 
I don't rem em ber. I was  a little girl, but I don't remember what happen
ed.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter: When was  your  br other  bor n? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  The baby?  Oh, he's like nine year s  younger  than I. I was  born in 1938.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Ok . So that brings us to Kr is tallnac ht, which I m entioned befor e, whic h is known as  

the Night of Broken Glass , whic h took  plac e over November
 
9 to the 10, 1938. As I mentioned befor e, 
your  fam ily's  windows  wer e br oken, your home was  looted. Can you tell us  in more detail about that 

night and what happened to your  family?
 

4 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah
. My br other  and I
 
--
 
not the baby. The baby was  like 18 months, m aybe. A 
baby, a newbor n baby.
 
So m y brother and I, the older one, but a year younger  than I am.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  J os eph.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah, J os eph. He and I were s leeping in m y bedroom and we wer e r eally exc ited 
bec aus e the next day was  going to be m y m other's  bir thday. It was  Novem ber
 
9. So we weren't quite 
s leeping. I think  it m ight have been, like, 11:00. All of a s udden som e br ick s  and rocks were being 
thrown thr ough the window.
 
I was  really s c ared. I c over ed m ys elf up with a blanket.
 
 
By the way, I'm telling you all of this  from  a c hild's point of view bec aus e that's how I 
r em em ber it.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  You wer e a c hild.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah. So I was  r eally fr ightened. I c over ed m ys elf up with a blanket. But he was  

always  braver  than me, always . So any way, he went to the window. He pulled him s elf up and he looked 
outs ide. And he s aid to m e, "Sus i, it is  our neighbors " that are throwing the bricks and r ocks thr ough the 
wind
ow. And ther e was  a polic em an, the c ivil policem an. He was  s tanding like this  at the edge of the 
c r owd. He was  holding his  arms like this . And he was n't doing anything to s top it.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  Not telling them  to stop.Was  he enc ouraging them?  He just was  doing nothing.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Well, he was  doing nothing.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster : Which enc our aged them.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah, yeah. Exac tly. So we were really fr ightened.
 
 
So we s tar ted to r un acros s  the hall to our parents ' bedr oom where the
 
baby was  s leeping 
with our par ents . And just then at that very moment, s ome of thos e people had upr ooted a telephone 

pole and sm as hed it through our front door. They looted s om e of the things  in our hous e but their m ain 
objec tive was  to get to the rabbi's
 
apartment.
 
 
Can I tell you
 
--
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Please.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  About the building.We lived on 
the fir st floor. And then the r abbi of the town, one 
r abbi, lived on the s ec ond floor. And on the thir d floor there was  a non
-
J ewis h fam ily. A nd 
on the four th 
floor was  an attic.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Ok .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So m y father s aid, let's  go and hide up in the attic . In the m eantim e, all of the 

people that wer e going thr ough our front door  and through our  hallway, their objective was  to ge
t to the 
s ec ond floor  to get into the rabbi's apartm ent and to loot his apartment and do away with s ome of his  

ar tifacts that he had. After they got his apartment
 
--
 
finally we got to the attic . The family, the rabbi's 
family, was  alr eady up ther e but the r abbi was n't ther e. And in the attic ther e was  this  little window. And 
I looked through the little window and I saw the rabbi was standing on his veranda. The two SS 
offic ers
 
--
 
people, you will s ee them up on that fourth floor. They are wearing this  
beige
 
uniform
; 
they 
had arm bands with the s wastika. They wer e holding him. One of them came and c ut off his  beard. 

Later on I found out that they hauled him off to jail.
 
And later on I found out that they put everybody in 
jail, all the men, put them in jail that night for  the s im ple reason that they wer e J ewis h.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter: Was  your  father ar rested?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  No
 
--
m
y father  was arrested, but he c am e back  the next day.Why he c ame 
bac k  the next day m y brother and I never  r eally found out.We s
hould have asked my father more but 
we think
 
--
 
m y father  us ed to play c hes s  with the mayor  of the town. And he als o was  Polis h. He was  
bor n in Poland.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Your  father.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  My father, yes. So we thought maybe he was  s aved bec aus e the m ayor  liked 
him  and he was  his  fr iend or m aybe they didn't arr es t that night the people that were not German Jews . 
So he c ame back.
 
 
I found out that on that night, on the night of my mother's  birthday, they didn't only c ome to our  
house and br eak  our windows  and loot our apartm ents but they did it to ever y family that was  a J ewis h 

family in 
Bad Kr euznac h. And not only did they do that but they went into all of
 
--
 
if ther e wer e any 

5 
 
s tores left that wer e belonging to J ews
 
--
 
and, of c our s e, they weren't doing well bec aus e not s o many 
people bought but there were s om e stor es left bec aus e s ome J ews  did s hop. And s om e of the people 
that wer e non
-
J ewis h, they c ould have s hopped. They wouldn't have gotten arr es ted. They c ould have 
gone ther e but they did
n't.
 

> > Kyr a Sc hus ter: Were the s tor es marked as  being owned by J ews ?  Is that how people knew to 
boyc ott them ?  In your town. I know in other towns  they were but.
 

> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. That's a ver y good question. But I was  this  little kid. I didn't
 
under stand all 
of it. Now I understand it.
 
 
Any way s o they looted all of the Jewis h ones  left. We had one s ynagogue and they burnt 
down the s ynagogue. And then I found out that they not only did that to the people in Bad Kr euznac h 

but they did it in ever y
 
town wher e J ewis h people lived in Germ any. And bec aus e s o m uc h glas s was  
br oken, they c alled it Night of Brok en Glas s . 
 
 
How many of you heard about it?  Oh, wow. You lear n about it in s c hool?  Yeah? 
 
 
Any way, Kr is tallnac ht, whic h m eans Night of Broken Gl
ass.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  How long wer e you and your  family and then the family  of the r abbi, the wife and 

c hildren, how long wer e all of you in the attic  for ?
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah, you know, people as k  me that. I r eally don't remember. Maybe it was  lik
e 
four or five days . I think  it was  like that.
 
 
The non
-
J ewis h people that lived on the third floor , well, they were bys tanders . They didn't do 
anything. They didn't denounc e us  and tell the Nazis  we wer e hiding in the attic , but they didn't do 

anything to
 
s ave us either. So they just wer e on
-
looker s  and they didn't do anything.
 
 
After the Night of Broken Glass, m y father who had wanted to s tay in Germany, bec aus e he 
thought maybe the whole thing was  going to blow over
 
--
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter : Which a lot of people did.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly. Exac tly. My m other always  wanted to c ome to the United States .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter : Why the United States ?  Did she have fam ily here?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, we had heard so many wonderful things about the United States . My father 

did have a r elative her e but, you know, in Ger many ever ybody knew that the United States was  the 

land of m ilk  and honey and land of democ rac y, wher e ther e was  no pr ejudic e against J ews  and where 
you c ould live fr eely without having all of this  anti
-
S em itis m.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  So your mother  wanted to leave. Your father was  initially res is tant.
 

> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  So was  it Kr is tallnac ht that pus hed him to c hange his m ind?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.
 
>> Kyra 
Sc hus ter : What did they do then?  How did they m ake arr angements  to get out at that point?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly. This  was  going on in many homes in Germany. Kris tallnac ht was  the 
thing that told all the J ews  things are not going to get better. Before ever ybody thought, well, m aybe 
Hitler 's  not going to be in power anymore, things will c hange. But the Night of Br ok en Glas s  all the 

J ews  wanted to leave.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  How did they m ake arr angements  to get out onc e they dec ided that's  what they 

we
r e going to do?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. My father wanted to c ome to the United States  but, you know, ther e was  a 

quota. Ther e was  a quota for  all the c ountries in the world bec aus e they were s o worr ied that the Jews  
would m es s up their ec onomic  s ys tem ; 
that they wer e going to take away the jobs  of the people of the 
c ountr y. So it was  ver y diffic ult to get a vis a.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  So eac h c ountr y that people wanted to go to had a lim ited number of vis as  that they 
would is s ue depending on the c ountr y you
 
were born in. So you and your siblings  and your  mother 
would fall under the German quota, but your  father  would fall under the Polis h quota, I think . So it 

depended
 
--
 
you had to have c onnec tions  to get the right paper s in or der to get out, whether that b
e to 
the United States  or  to any other c ountr y that was  open to ac c epting r efugees. 
 

6 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, s o we c ouldn't
 
--
 
they let sc ientis ts c ome to the United 
States and movie s tars  and big directors. But m y father was  jus t this s hopkeeper , s o he was  like on the 
bottom of the lis t.
 
 
So any way, what he wanted to do was  he wanted to m ake s ur e that his c hildren were s afe. So 
he found out about this lady that was  tr ans porting c hildr en acros s the border  into Franc e. Bad 
Kr euznac h is  near Frank furt. If you go s traight wes t, you will get to Paris. It's  not really that far.
 

 
Any way, this  lady, for  a lot of money
 
--
 
all the money that m y father had saved and that I us ed 
to c ar ry ar ound in my underwear  
--
 
bec aus e he couldn't put his m oney in the bank anym ore
. S
o he took  
all of the money that he had left and he gave it to this  lady who pr etended we wer e her  c hildren. She 
was  a Fr enc h lady who pr etended we wer e her  c hildren and s he took  us acros s  the bor der.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  J us t you and J os eph.
 
The baby s tayed with your  parents.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah. He was  a baby, really little. Yeah. 
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  So s he s m uggled you by tr ain. You went with her  to Franc e. And wher e did s he take 
you initially
 o
nc e you c r os s ed the bor der ? 
 
> > Susan Wa
r s inger:  Well, we went to Paris . Yeah.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster : Who did you s tay with?
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah. That's a ver y good question. [Laughter]
 
 
My father had a thir d c ous in who lived in Paris . And he was  a young guy. I don't know if he 
was  in his  20s. He was  in heaven, a little apartment in Plac e de la Vendom e. So m y father must have 
m ade arr angem ents  for him  to tak e us into his  apar tm ent.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  How old were you and your brother at this time?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I
 
was  7 and he was  8, s omething. Yeah. No. The other way around. Eras e. He's 
7 and I'm  8.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  And now you'r e s taying with this  third c ous in in it his  young bac helor, 20s, in Paris  

who had never  taken c are of c hildr en befor e.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Right.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus
ter:  S o how
 
did he 
take c are of you?  How did you adjust to this  living ar rangem ent?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  For a while he went to wor k . And for a while he us ed to tell us to s tay in the 
apar tm ent until he c am e bac k from  work.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  How did that wor k  out?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, m y br other was  always  c urious  about life. I was  always  a goody, goody. I 
did ever ything ever ybody  told me to do. So he us ed to
 
--
 
7 year s  old?  
 
 
How old are they?  How old are you?  How old?
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  6.
 
>> 
SusanWars inger:  6?  Yeah? 
 
 
He s nuck out of the apartm ent and he went on the Metro. And that was  a long time ago. Paris 
was  one of the few c ities  in the world that had a Metro and was  c alled a Metro. He us ed to s neak under 
the style in the Metr o, go all over Par is. And then he knew when m y third cous in was  c om ing back . And 

he c am e back  jus t in time.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Kids don't do that. Right?  [Laughter]
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So anyway, this  c ous in r eally c ould not
 
--
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Not equipped to take c ar e of two c hildren.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes . So he found s om e organization. 
 
 
And all the m oney that many of you give to organizations , es pec ially to c hildr en's 
organizations , they really  did a lot of good. In those days  there was  a
 
plac e c alled the HIAS, the OCE, 
and the Quak ers. I don't know whic h one but the Quakers  were r eally trying to help kids  that were los t 

and s o they plac ed us in like a foster home in a little town around Par is. And evidently the Quakers 
m us t have paid for  it. So we went to sc hool and we learned how to s peak  Frenc h.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  How long wer e you in that fos ter  home? 
 

7 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Ok , so, this  is the firs t foster home. We were in one fir st. We didn't like it. Then 
we wer e in another one. So it was  another  fos ter home. So we wer e ther e until, like, J une
 
1940. So I 
bet the audienc e already knows  what happened in J une
 
1940.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  Do you guys  know?  Anyone?  Ok, that's  a lot of m umbling. Yes, s ir? 
 
> > [Inaudible]
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  The Germ ans invaded France?  That's right.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  That's r ight. He was n't only pr ejudic ed agains t the J ews . He s aid he's going to 
c onquer  all over Eur ope. He's gone into Poland, Czec hos lovakia, and Aus tria, of c our s e. And just like 
he s aid, in J u
ne
 
1940.
 
 
We used to s leep in our bedr oom. This was  on the outskir ts of Par is.We us ed to s leep in a 
bedr oom and we us ed to hear the planes  fly over, the Germ an planes  fly over. They wer e dropping 

bom bs  not on to Par is but where we wer e. It looked like the
 
Fourth of J uly sometimes  with all of these 
explosions  up in the sky.
 
 
So it was  1940. Then, I don't know how we got to Paris  when we got to Paris . Ever ybody in 
Paris  wer e r eally s c ar ed bec aus e the SS gentlemen over there said
 
--
 
they c ame m arc hing in. And
 
the 
people, not only J ews  in Paris  wer e fr ightened, ever ybody wanted to get out of Par is.
 
An
d 
s o they 
s tarted to leave Paris . And m ost of the people wanted to either  go down to the s outher n part and a lot 

of people wanted to go to Ver sailles .
 
 
Now, Vers ai
lles  is  like 15
 
m iles  or s om ething like that from  Paris . So I don't know, s ome nuns 
m us t have taken us. I don't know who. We wer e walking.We wer e going on the c ar. Other people were 

r iding on bic yc les . People were going on tr ains. Some people were going in carts .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  This m as s exodus  fr om the c ity out to the c ountr ys ide, outs ide the c ity limits where 

people thought they would be s afer.
 

> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. And we ended up in Ver s ailles .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Not a bad plac e to end up. Kind of fanc y. Right?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  It has  a big palac e there.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  I've heard of it.Where did they plac e you onc e you got to Vers ailles ? Wer e you in 

another foster home or?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  No, they didn't put us  in the foster home
 
bec aus e we wer e
 
--
 
thes e were not only 
Jews. 

> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Everybody.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So ever ybody went to the palac e. And so her e was  the m ayor  of the town. And 

he really didn't know what to do with all of us. so we had to have a plac e to s leep
. There was  this  big 

hay s tack
 
--
 
ther e was  this  beautiful garden. Som eplac e at the edge of the gar den there was  this  big 
pile, as  high as the c eiling, of hay. So they gave us  all a bur lap bag and we filled it up with the hay. And 

then they gave us a little str ing. And we put the string out and we had a mattress.
 
 
So then
 
--
 
s o wher e were we going to go with all of thes e mattres s es ? Whic h is  the largest 
r oom in Vers ailles ?
 

> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  I do. The Hall of Mir rors ?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes . The Hall of 
Mirrors.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  The m os t fam ous ballroom I think in the palac e.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  How many of you have been?  Do you r em ember the Hall of Mirr or s ?  
 
 
Any way, we lined our m attr es s es up all along the walls , all along the walls . So we s lept in
 
the 
Hall of Mirr ors . But it was n't only J ews .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  It was  ever ybody who fled. So did the Germans  eventually m ake their way to 

V er s ailles ?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter: What happened when they enc ounters all of thes e people in the palac e?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. So any way, they did c ome to Ver s ailles . We hear d them . We heard them  

m ar c hing. They have these heavy boots  and tank s . They c ame m arc hing into Vers ailles . People were 

fr ightened. 
 

8 
 
 
Any way, I r em ember what happened. Inthe front of the c ar avan ther e was  a c ar . A Nazi 
officer c ame out. I don't k now whether he was  a general or a major or a c olonel. I don't k now. So 
any way, he c ame out and he wanted to s peak  to the mayor. And, of c our se, the German gener al
 
--
 
I'll 
jus t call
 
him an offic er. The Germ an offic er did not know how to s peak  any Frenc h. The m ayor, they 
c alled him the mayor of the town, he c ame. The m ayor  of the town did not know how to s peak  any 
Germ an.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  They needed a trans lator.
 
> > Susan Wars inger
:  They needed a trans lator . And s omebody s aid, 
ﬁO
h, there's  this  little gir l in the 
palac e; s he knows  how to s peak Germ an
ﬂ . 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  So wer e you recr uited, bec ame the tr ans lator for this  offic er  and the town mayor ?
 

> > SusanWar s inger:  Exac tly.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  And you wer e 8 years  old.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  Did that work out ok? 
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Well, any way
 Œ 
No. B
y this  time I'm  10.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter :  Still.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah. So what happened was  her e was  this  little gir l. I don't know what they 

talked about. I just don't rem em ber . It's  been a long time. And s o what happened was  after the 
c onvers ation, evidently I m us t have done all right. The Nazi offic er stood in fr ont of m e. He was  tall. 
A ll I 
c ould s ee wer e his  boots. I was  a little kid. I was  really ver y frightened. So he s aid to m e, "Little gir l, 

how c ome you know how to s peak Germ an s o well?"
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Really put you on the s pot. What did you s ay?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I said to him
 
I go to the Fr enc h s c hools  and they are ver y good and I learned 
how to s peak Ger man in the Frenc h sc hools .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Very quick  for  you. [Laughter]
 
 
So how long were new Vers ailles ?  Did you eventually evac uate Ver s ailles  and they moved 
you 
further  s outh, keep going s outh?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly. That's  what happened. The Nazis  took over not all of Franc e. They took  
the nor ther n par t and then the wes tern part and jus t the ins ide in the s outhern par t. They said that was  
going to be the unoc c upied zone of Fr ance.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter : Which we now r efer to as  Vichy Fr anc e.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  That's r ight.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  So you were in a home in that zone.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So what happened, one of the OCE, [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Langu
age], they 
m ade s ure that the J ewis h c hildren, by that tim e m any J ewis h c hildr en wer e los t all over  Europe and all 
over  Franc e. They all s ent thos e c hildren to the chateau in a little town. We were there.We went to 
s c hool there. They had a public  s c hool. And what happened was  they wanted the c hildren to go to the 

village to the public  s c hool. And the s ad part of it was  the people there in the village, they didn't want to 
m ix
 
--
 
and thes e wer e all far m er s ' kids . They didn't want their c hildren to m ix with the J ewish c hildren. I 
gues s they were looking down on us  bec aus e we were refugees. So what they did is  they gave us  a 

Fr ench teac her.
 
We had a one
-
r oom s c hoolhous e and there the teacher taught all of us to s peak  
Fr ench and all the grades .
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:
  
So you'r e in a new c hildr en's home. You've been m oved all over , Par is, s outh, 
s outh, s outh. And this  whole time you haven't had any c ontact with your  parents, you and your  br other 
haven't hear d fr om them. You'r e obvious ly thinking about them .
 
> > Susan Wa
r s inger:  A ll the tim e. All the time.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  You had no idea what was  happening with them and your  brother  at that point.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  No.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Did you eventually find out?  Were you able to get in touc h with them or they 
in 

touc h with you?  No.
 

9 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  We wr ote to them all the tim e. Every day
 
--
 
we had this  part of the day where you 
c ould write to your par ents . But the letters
 
--
 
we never  hear d a r eply.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  So you were wr iting to them at your  home in Bad Kreuznac h as s um ing they wer e 
s till ther e but you didn't k now for s ur e.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Right.
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  One day you get c alled into the pr inc ipal's  offic er . The Dir ec tor of the home c alls  

into your  offic e. What did 
s he 
tell you?
 
>> 
Kyra Sc hus ter :  She said, "Sus i, you'r e going to go to the United States."
 
> > Kyr a Sc hus ter:  J us t like that.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  J us t like that. I couldn't believe m y ear s . What was  I going to do in the United 

States ? 
 
 
So what had happened was  my father
 
--
 
r em em ber , I told you at the beginning he had a 
c ous in who had a pickle fac tory. Maybe I didn't tell you. Did I?
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  I think  you mentioned it. I knew that. They m ay not have known.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  He had a pickle fac tor y in Brooklyn.
 
This c ous in, they went to the State 
Depar tment, to the HIAS, all kinds  of organizations  and they prom is ed the United States  that m y father  
would never be a bur den to the United States and that they would take c are ec onom ic ally. So finally he 
got affidavit
s  to 
co
m e to the United States. But it was n't enough for m y baby brother and m y m other . So 
m y father c am e to the United States . So then he worked real har d. He was  really good at s elling things  
door
-
to
-
door. And what he did is  he went to the farm er and he got eggs  fr om  the farm er and then he 
took the eggs  hom e and c andled them , whic h m eant he had this  little box with a light ins ide.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Ins pect the eggs ?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly r ight. Yes . So then he put them  in boxes . And he s old them  t
o all the 
neighbor s and all the J ewis h fam ilies  that wer e in Was hington, D.C. 
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Made s ur e they were kos her so he c ould s ell them  to the J ewis h c us tom ers.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Right.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  So he worked har d her e in the s tates .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  He got enough backing fr om  the c ous in, owner of the pickle factory, he got my 

m other  and the baby here als o.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  So it was n't enough that your par ents had the r ight paper s  to tr avel to the United 

States with the vis a, but ever ybody needed to have s omeone s ponsor ing them who lived here in the 
United States , was  an Am er ican c itizen of good standings, who s aid we will be financ ially r es pons ible to 
that the s tate or federal government would not be res pons ible for the payment
, life expens es , of thes e 
r efugees c om ing in. So your father  was  then able to earn enough
 
--
 
or your cousin, als o, to s pons or 
your  mother  and br other.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Right.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  So now they'r e all her e but you and J os eph are in the South of Franc e. And then 

you find out, s ur pr is e, you're going to Am er ic a.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  How did
 
you 
get fr om this  hom e in s outher n Franc e, to your  parents ? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So what happened was  Eleanor Roos evelt, s he also worked ver y hard to get 
c hildren to c ome to the United States . So ther e was  this group of 50 kids that were going on the Ser pa 
Pinto.We all wore that tag that you s aw at the beginning.We joined that gr oup of c hildren that s he 
s pons ored to c om e to the United States.
 
 
So we went from Paris  to Mar s eille and then we took  the tr ain from  Mar s eille ac ross  the 
Pyrenees  to Spain. Then we got on a s hip with the 50 c hildren. So it was  a c r uis e s hip but it was  not 

like the cruis e s hips we have today. It was  muc h smaller . And the kids  were not allowed to m ix with the 
people that wer e on the c r uis e. We had a s pec ial ar ea at the front of the ship, in the hull. And all 50 of 
us  s lept in this one room. We had double
-
decker, tr iple

> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Bunk  beds ?
 
> > Susan War s inger:  Yes , bunk  beds.We wer e very excited. 
 

10
 
 
 
Do I have time to tell you another  story? 
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  About your  br other?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. Bec aus e it's relevant.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  My br other
 
--
 
we wer en't s uppos ed to mix with the people on the boat but, of c ours e, 
he went all over the s hip. He found a c los et where they had s tored pineapple. The United States
 
--
 
I 
don't know where they wer e getting the pineapple from. He was  s o eating the pineapp
le c ons tantly. We 
had never  eaten any pineapple.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  An exotic  fr uit. Yeah.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. So in the m eantim e, he was  s o exc ited
. H
e us ed to wet his  bed in the 
bunk beds . So between the pineapple and the ac id and the boat going, 14 days  on this  ocean, going 

like this , he us ed to throw up a lot inside, over  the boat. However, at night he us ed to urinate in his bed 

and he had all of this  ac id on him, s o he got this big ras h.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  So what happened when you finally docked, arr ived?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I have to tell you one m ore s tor y befor e we arr ived.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > SusanWars inger:  It's  r eally impor tant. The photogr apher  was  her e. He just did a little thing about 
this . Anyway, you c an get it online, I unders tand.
 
 
Any way, what happened was  they told us at 6:00
 
in the morning we wer e going to pass  the 
Statue of Liberty.When we got ups tairs, you know, on
 
deck, befor e 6:00, there was  a big fog. The fog 
was  s o heavy that you could not s ee in fr ont of your fac e. We us ed
 
to hold our hand like this  and we 
c ouldn't s ee it in front of our
 
fac e. So we were really ups et that we weren't going to s ee the Statue of 
Liber ty. But at exac tly 6:00
 
--
 
and I'm not m aking this  up. This is ac tually what happened. Every time I 
think  about it, I get goose pim ples . You know when you go to the theater , the c ur tain r is es  and it goes  
up and then there is  the s how?  Well, anyway, the fog went up like this . It li
fted up like that and just then 
the whole statue.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  There s he was . Beautiful.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah. It was
 
--
 
it was
 
--
 
it was  a s ign for us that it was  going to be a reunion with 
our  parents, m ost of all. And then als o we knew we were com ing to a dem oc r atic  s oc iety wher e we 

were going to be free and ther e was  not going to be any anti
-
Semitis m and the kids  weren't going to 
bully us  anym ore.We wer e s o exc ited to be there.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster : Were your  parents  waiting for  you on the dock
? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  My m other stayed with the baby bec aus e he was  a baby.
 
 
So we got to New York City. Everybody was  getting off the boat but the 50 kids  didn't get off 
the boat bec aus e they wanted to have the doctors  c heck  them  out to m ak e s ure that they didn't have 
any infectious  dis eas es.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Standar d pr oc edure for all new im migr ants and r efugees  c om ing into the c ountr y.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes , yes , yes . So they got to my br other. And he had this  r as h.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  From the pineapple. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So I tried to explain to them  what had happened but they didn't believe this  little 

gir l. I don't k now what language I was  talking.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  You didn't s peak  Englis h, only Fr enc h and Germ an.
 
> > Susan W

So any way, you people k now what happens  to people if they won't let you c ome into the 
United States ?  Huh? 
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Quarantine. Som eone s aid quar antine.

SusanWars inger:  Ellis  Is land. Thank you. Yeah, exac tly. He has to go to Ellis  Is land. He c an't

got to Ellis  Is land, they had doc tors . He was  better. 
 
 B

they m ade them go into the woods , dig their 

graves , and then they s hot them. So m y grandparents , my aunts  and unc les , ever ybody. Nobody. And I 
don't have any on m y m other's  s ide either bec ause they wer e in the c onc entr ation c am ps  in Ger many. 
And they all died. Exc ept I have one c ous in who is  living in Isr ael that was  my father's  s ister but s he 

went to Is r ael befor e Hitler  c ame into power. So she has  a fam ily. So I do have that one family.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  And you have your  family now.
 
> > Susan Wars inger: 
 
Oh, I'm  very happy. I have three wonderful daughters . I have nine gr andc hildren. 
They all are doing really well.

Kyra Sc hus ter :  So we have a c ouple of m inutes  to ask  s ome questions  fr om the audienc e if that's 
ok  with you. 
 
 
I would as k , for thos e of you who have questions , we have two mic r ophones , one on eac h 
ais le. I ask that you wait until you have ac c es s  to a mi
c
r ophone
 
s o that everyone c an hear your  
question. I m ay r epeat your  question as well jus t s o I c an m ake s ure Sus an and everyone els e c an hear 
it as  well. So if anyone has  a question.
 
 
Yes , in the back
, 
in the red.
 
> > Hi. Have you been bac k  to Vers ailles  or
 
Bad Kr euznac h s inc e?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes . C
an 
I 
tell about Germany firs t?  I wanted to show my thr ee daughters  when 
they wer e teenager s
 
--
 
when was  it?  Like in the 
`
70s . I wanted to s how them  the town where I was  
bor n. So we m ade arrangem ents to go there. But in the 1970s, the people in Germany, nobody wanted 

to talk  about it. The s ur vivor s  didn't want to talk about it. They put it in the bac k  of their  heads. And the 
m us eum was n't here. People hadn't started to wr ite books  about the Holoc aus t. And they c ertainly 
didn't learn about it in s chool bec aus e when I went to the univer s ity here, there was  nothing mentioned, 
the Sec ond World War but nothing about the Holoc aus t was  there.
 
 
So any way, I got to Bad Kr euznac h and we didn't know how to c omm unicate with the people 
and everybody felt unc omfor table. The people in Bad Kr euznac h felt unc omfortable and I felt 

unc omfortable. So we got out of there and went to Paris .
 
 
But the next tim e I went
 
--
 
you know the baby, my br other Ernest?  He's  a phys ic is t, a ver y
 
big 
phys ic is t. Som e of his  experim ents went up in the s pac e pr ogram. But he went num er ous tim es , goes  

all over the world to c onferenc es on ozone. So one day in the 
`
90s, 1998, he went to Germ any in 
Dus s eldorf to go to a m eeting to dis c us s the ozone. So he
 
told m e. And I said, ﬁCan I go with you?
ﬂ
  
And he s aid
, ﬁS
ure.
ﬂ  
So I went with him .
 
So in 1998, while he was  at his meetings, I went to Frank fur t. I 
walked around and s at in c afes. Som e people I met. And I told them, you k now, who I was . And they 
were open to talk about it. But there was  nothing really public . The people wer en't r eady to talk about it.
 
 
However, like thr ee years  ago I went again. I went to Berlin bec aus e I had never  been in 
Berlin befor e. Things have c hanged tr emendous ly. Berlin's got mus eums , Holoc aus t mus eums , 
m onuments, laws
 
--
 
we met the m ayor of the town. Nobody was  suppos ed to s ay anything derogatory 
agains t J ewis h people. You c an go to jail if you s tart talking about J ewis h people. So everybody's  come 
out of the c los et and ever ybody's  talk ing about it.
 
 
Now, this  is  a really good ques tion bec aus e it leads  to why did all of this  happen.Why are all 
of the s urvivor s  c om ing out of the c los et and why ar e the Germ an people talking about
 
it. Well, the 
r eas on for it is
 
we don't want this  to happen ever again. That's  why the mus eum  is here. So we wanted 
to make s ur e that when we s ee injus tic e going on in the wor ld we have to do s om ething about it.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Don't be a bys tander .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Right. 
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Is ther e
 
another ques tion?  Ther e's a young man in the back I think.
 
> >Where is  your brother today? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  My brother? Well, you know, the one that's s o c ur ious ?
 

> > [Laughter] 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I'm  glad you asked m e about him. He becam e a c ardiologis t. He went to m edic al 
s c hool. He bec ame a very good c ardiologist in New Yor k. He s aved a lot of people's  lives . He had a 
nic e hous e. He had four childr en. He has  like 10 grandc hildren. His  c hildren ar e all gr own up now. His  
wife pas s ed away s om e time ago. But it was  fine. So he s old his hous e and he dec ided to live bac k  in 
New York City. And guess  where in New York  City he dec ided to buy him self this beautiful apartment. 

Gues s where it is .
 
> > Tr ump To
wer .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  No.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

>> Su
sanWars inger:  Good gues s , but the thing is , there is this plac e c alled Batter y Park  in New York, 
at the point, where you can look  out of your window and s ee the Statue of Liberty, and you c an s ee Ellis  

13
 
 
Is land. This is  a hotel, the Ritz Carlton. And on top they have these beautiful apartm ents. And his  
apar tm ent he has  a lot of r ooms  in his  apartm ent. And every r oom  gues s  what it looks
 
--
 
what you can 
look out on to?  You look  out on to the Atlantic  ocean. You c an s ee the boats  c ome in. You s ee the 

Statue o
f Liber ty. You s ee Ellis  Is land. So that's  where he's  living now. He's  retir ed. He has a lot of 
grandc hildr en and a lot of c hildr en. You k now, Hitler  didn't acc omplis h what he s et out to do with m y 

family.
 
 
And you hear d about my other  brother , the phys ic is t. He has  two kids and five gr andc hildr en. 
So we have a big fam ily.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  On that note, I'm going to turn bac k  to you to c los e out our pr ogram. But befor e I do 
that, I want to thank everybody for  joining us today. We hope that you c an c om e ba
ck for s ome of our 
other
 
Firs t Pers on
 
programs.
 
If you didn't get a c hanc e to ask  your  question, you will have that 
opportunity outs ide afterwards .
 
 
We do our
 
Firs t Pers on
 
progr am  ever y Wednes day and Thur s day thr ough the m iddle of 
August. And it is  our  tr adition here at
 
Fir s t Per s on
 
that we let our Firs t Per son have the final word. But 
before s he s peaks I want to tell you two quick things.
 
 
As  I mentioned, you'll have the opportunity to ask  a question outside. Susan will be s igning 
c opies  of the "Ec hoes of Memory" book . And you don't have to purc has e a back to ask a question but 
s he will be ther e s igning books and ans wering ques tions  as well. You c an jus t s ay hello. You c an shake 

her  hand. You c an have your pic tur e taken
 a
nd all of that.
 
 
And I'm also going to ask that you all s tay in your  s eats  at the end of the program s o that we 
c an get Sus an to the back  of the theater as quickly as  pos s ible. Als o, you m ay have notic ed our 
photogr apher , J oel, has  been r unning ar ound taking pic tures  of ever ything thr oughout
 
the program. 
He's  going to take a pic tur e of Sus an with all of you in the back gr ound s o it's  a nic e m emory for Sus an 
to have of our tim e together  this  m or ning.
 
 
With all of that, Sus an, I leave it to 
you
 
to give us  your las t words  of the morning.
 
>>
 
SusanWar s inger:  Yes . But befor e I do that, I just wanted to m ake s ure. I had s o many hands 
r ais ed, that ar e still going to the Perm anent Exhibition. And s ince tim e a tour guide, I want to m ak e s ure 

that you don't m is s  out on anything. So when you get up
 
on that elevator, you're going to be on the 
fourth floor. You're going to be in 1945, you know, when the whole s tor y of the Holoc aus t is  over . Then 
you're going to go walking ar ound the c or ner and it will be 1933. And that's when my s tor y starts. 
 
 
So one
 
of the fir s t things that you're going to s ee is  you're going to s ee thes e two polic emen 
with a dog. And one of them  is a c ivil polic eman. He's  wearing a blue uniform with a funny hat. 
Rem em ber  I was  telling you about the c ivil polic eman that was  in
 
Bad Kr
euznac h 
who didn't do 
anything?  Ther e's  one of them s tanding in the pictur e. He's  walking along with the SS men, with the 
people for the Nazis . They're walking together.
 
So m ake s ure you r ead that. It's c alled
 
--
 
no. I forgot the 
nam e of it. Any way.
 
 
Then
 
next to that exhibit is  the guy standing in fr ont of a s tore boyc otting the stor e. And then 
next to that I would like for you to tak e a look . Ther e's s ome kids r eading a book. They are r eading a 
book  c alled "Der Giftpilz." An elementar y s c hool teac her was
 
r eading it to them. My teac her read it t
o 
them. They were telling kids  ﬁJ ews  ar e pois oned mus hr oom s." So make sure to s ee that exhibit. 
 
 
Then you keep on going and you s ee a park . And then there are all of these s igns  "J ews  ar e 
not wanted." This  is ver y s imilar  to m y story. And then you'r e going to go a little bit further on, ther e's  a 

whole exhibit on Kr istallnac ht.
 
> > Kyra Sc hus ter :  Those are all on the top floor , firs t floor you'r e going to go thr ough in the exhibition.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  And then you'r e going to com e to a stor y about a boat, the St. Louis. I didn't 

c om e on the St. Louis . But the s hip, they have pictures of the s hip. Looks exac tly like the Serpa Pinto.
 
 
So I hope that you have a wonderful lear ning exper ienc e up ther e. Mos t of the thi
ngs that 
happened to me were all on the fourth floor . Then when you go to the third floor, you know, you'r e 

going to lear n about the conc entration c amps. Make s ure you leave your s elf s ome tim e for the s econd 
floor whic h deals  with the liberator
 
--
 
with r es
c uers  and people who were not bys tanders , people who 

14
 
 
did s om ething. And if the whole wor ld had s tood up to Hitler  or had done something at the ver y 
beginning, m aybe the whole Holoc aus t would nev er  have happened.
 
 
A ny way. I'm taking up too muc h time. I jus t
 
wanted you to be looking for thes e things.
 
Any way

> > Kyra Sc hus ter:  Always  an educ ator. Never s top teac hing.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I hope you don't m ind if I r ead this . I wr ote this  out som e tim e ago.
 

 
I want my c hildr en, m y grandc hildren, my brother s and their fam ilies , m y friends  and the 
vis itors  her e in the audienc e to r ejoic e in the fact that we are living in a democ ratic  s oc iety and that all 

of us s hould make s ure that no dic tators hip would ever us ur p our liber ties.
 
 
We need to r em em ber  the atr oc ities  that happened to families  during the Holoc aus t and pass 
this  inform ation on. We need to lear n from this  horr or  in our his tory. We c annot undo the atroc ities  of 
the past. But bes ides  r em ember ing, we have to take ac tion to c onfront hate. When we s ee inju
stice 
taking plac e, we have to do s omething about it.We c annot be on
-
looker s. We have to be s ens itive to 
eac h other  and we have to take care of eac h other.
 
 
Now, why do I volunteer  in this  m us eum ?  People ask me
, H
ow c an you do this  over and 
over ?  How c an I not?  Giv ing tours to our vis itors  thr ough our Permanent Exhibition hopefully teac hes  

them what hatred and prejudic e c an do to people.
 
When touring the law enforc em ent offic er s and futur e 
FBI agents , I hope that they under s tand their r ole when enc ounte
ring atroc ities .
 
 
We 
c annot be bys tanders  and definitely not c ollaborators . There are threats  and genoc ide in 
m any parts  of the world at the pres ent tim e. We cannot be indiffer ent to emerging threats of genocides  
and m ass  atroc ities. All of us need to be aware about what is  happening and that we need to work 
together to take the nec es s ar y ac tions to pr event people fr om being m urdered for the s im ple reas on 
that they ar e differ ent.
 
 N
ever  again do we want to stand by and do nothing.
 
 
I want to thank you, Kyra
 
Sc hus ter , for  helping m e tell m y s tory.
 
> > Kyra Sc huster :  My pleas ur e.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  And I want to thank  the audienc e for c om ing to our  mus eum and being witnes s es  

to the story of the Holoc aus t and for  lis tening to my s tory.
 
I want you to have a wonderful learning 
experienc e when you get upstairs  to our perm anent exhibit.
 
 
Thank  you for lis tening.
