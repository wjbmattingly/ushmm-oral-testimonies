Germa ny
, and lots of news, stuff 
about it. And a buddy of

mine I ran around with, my  best friend, why 
he and I said well, it™s time we tried to 
get in the service. I was crazy in those da
ys, I was about 17 or something. So I tried 
to Œ tried to get in the Canadian roy Œ 
RCAF
, the Canadian Air Force. And you had 
to move to 
Canada
 and live there for two years befo
re they™d  take you. So  we 
didn™t do that. So I just waited until a draf
t notice came, and went 
in the Œ went into 
basic training th at I di Œ didn™t know wher
e I was going. I got on a bus and they  
drove me to 
Fresno
,
 California
, and that was a Œ a basic training. 
Q: When  did that Œ you wa Œ hang on just
 for a mo ment, when did th at draft notice 
come? What year was that? 

A: It mu st have been ™42. 
Q: Okay . 
A: 1940 Œ I was working gravey ard at Œ on aircraft engines 
[indecipherable]
 
B-17s
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ at 
Ardman
(ph) aircraft, and going to  school
 in the daytime.
 Anyway, I Œ I 
don™t rememb er the exact date or anything
 like that, it™s a long time ago. Bu t went 
to basic training at 
Fresno
, and after basic training I went to 
Sioux Falls
,
 South 
Dakota
 for radio school. Went from there to 
Salt Lake City
 for continued training, 
stuff like that, radio and communications and 
stuff like that. And then I was sent to 
Dyersburg
,
 Tennessee
 for training in 
B-17s
 as a radio operator, and top gunner on 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

the 
B-17
. And after training there I had Œ I wanted
 to be a fighter pilot, so I applied 
for fighter training, and nothing happened, so
 after Œ just about 
the time that we was 
ready to ship overseas with Œ 
th rough basic training th ere at 
Dyersburg
,
 Tennessee
 
in 
B-17s
, and dummy  missions, you know, and 
navigation stuff like that. And flew 
down  over 
Cuba
, and stuff, was just long range 
navigation traini
ng. Orders came 
through find us, report to 
Fort Wo rth
,
 Texas 
for fighter school. I was already on a 
crew, so I was Œ now I™m gonna stay with th
e crew right there, and train with them 
for months, and so we went to 
Germany
. I went to fra Œ I went to 
England
 and 
then re Œ 
Germany
 later. So, went to the 91
st
 bomb group in 
Ba ssing bo urn
,
 
England
, and that was shortly after the 
Memphis Belle 
comp leted its 25 missions, 
the first plane to finish a Œ a grou
p of missions, to go home, and then Œ 
Q: Let™s ba Œ let™s back  up, just for a moment. 
A: Surely. 

Q: Let™s go back to training. What did 
you think of training?
 Did you enjoy it? 
Were there Œ 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Œ difficult parts to it? What wa
s the most challe
nging thing for you? 
A: I thought it was interesting. Was Œ we ha
d a lo-lot of this Œ 
lots of Œ lots of 
training, learn communications and stuff. It™s something new fo
r a young guy, you

know, and was interesting to see the Œ ho
w long th e radio Œ how 
far you could reach 
on the radios, where you could talk to Au
stralians, and was up in altitude, cause we 
had a training an tenna that we could let out
 in the Œ in the radio room, you know. 
And I thought it was in
teresting, you know. 
Q: And did you like to be a 
radio operator, or di Œ how mu
ch say did you have in Œ 
in the job that you ended up doing? 
A: I wa Œ always Œ I liked engines and stuff, and I wanted to be a Œ if I was going to 
be a Œ in the sir Œ first, you know, to be
 an engine mechanic. 
So I thought I™d do 
that, but they gave you a-aptitu de tests. And when I was in 
Fresno
 basic training, 
they give you these tests, all sorts of st
uff, mechanical and electrical and everything 
else. And I was able to do real good in  el
ectrical and they need ed electronic people 
then, so they chose me 
to go to  radio school, 
Sioux Falls
,
 South Dakota
, so that™s 
where I went. 
Q: You didn™t have any problem with that? 
A: No, I didn™t have any problem. I liked 
th Œ I Œ I™m Œ I liked
 to Œ I liked both, 
electronics, and I became and 
electrical engineer later, a
nd Œ and I always still fool 
with en Œ engines, racing engine and st
uff. It™s a hobby, I™m just inquisitive. 
Q: From the 
United States
 you go to 
England
 with the 91
st
 bo-bomb group. What 
par Œ which air force was that? Was that Eighth Air Force?

A: Eighth Air Force, first division, 91
st
 bomb group. 
Q: Rough Œ do you rememb er Œ recall when
 that was when you went over to 
England
? 
A: It was Œ it mu st have been in June
 or July™44, near as I can recall. 
Q: How did you get over to 
England
? 
A: Flew over. 

Q: You flew over? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: On wh-what sort of aircraft? 

A: I believe we left our plane in Œ in  
Ba ngo r
,
 Maine
 and we got on a Œ I believe it 
was a military transp ort 
[indecipherable]
 
C-47 
possibly, very possibly, I don™t 
really recall. I know there was a bunch of 
people on it. There was about six nurses 
and a bunch  of us guys on there Œ there. 
We landed in Œ in s Œ I think in Œ in  
Wa les
 
first, and then we took off from there a
nd went Œ some people 
left, you know, we 
went down to 
Bassingbourn
. 
Q: And where Œ I™m sorry, wh ere did you say you ended up in 
Eng l and
? Where 
was your base, your first ba Œ 

A: 
Bassingbourn
. It™s about 15 kilometers from ha Œ 
Cambridg e
. 
Q: What™d  you think of 
England
?

A: Oh, it was interesting, yo
u know. A young person always
 Œ things are interesting 
to a young person. And the 
nice countryside, the Œ the Œ the base was a Œ was a 
RAF
 base, had been before, and 
then they carv
ed out a lot of trees, they cut trees 
down  and we parked  some of the planes in
 the a Œ the trees, for camouflage, I guess 
really. And some of the buildings, we had 
Quonset huts, we had 
brick buildings, we 
had different types of 
build ings, cause a lot of them we
re put in just to Œ you know, 
as new construction, because we moved in 
and taken over this 
whole milit Œ British 
base. So Œ 
Q: Did you interact wi
th the British at all? 
A: Oh yeah. There was British people there.
 We™d go to the little p ubs and stuff like 
that, and eat, you know, a
nd no, it was good, and Œ 
Q: How were you treated 
by them, by the English? 
A: Oh, very well. The girls would come to
 the base and walk 
around, they™d talk 
with us and stuff like that, you know, and 
carry on conversations and then th ey Œ 
they™d go to town, 
the people Œ I only had one instan
ce where I Œ I was on leave, go 
Œ go Œ I was going to go to 
Lo ndon
, I was on the train over th
ere Œ their trains have 
a comp artment on one side, and a aisle dow
n the other side there, you na Œ a 
compartment with about six peop
le in them. And I was going to  
Londo n
 one time 
and there was a little kid in there. I 
reached in my pocket and took out a 
Hershey
 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

chocolate bar, and gave this
 little kid. And the mother 
scolded me for tormenting 
this little kid, because that™s
 the only candy bar he had 
and he probably will ever 
have, and I shouldn™t have given it to hi
m. And I thought I was doing him a favor. 
Q: Sure. 
A: Cause the little kids woul
d Œ you™d go up and down th
e street and the little kids 
would see a American 
G
.
I
., cause we always had, you know, spearmint chewing 
gum, or stuff like that, and they ™d  say, 
got any gum, chum? And they ™d co me out 
and grab you by the legs or something 
like that, say that, you know, and almo st 
knock you down. And so, we
 just Œ you know, took candy and stuff for the little 
kids, and give it to them, you know, thought
 that was good. But that™s the only time 
I ever had a run in with one that was Œ sh
e just jumped all over me for giving her 
little kid that candy bar.  

Q: What did you think of 
London
? 
A: Was kind of interesting city. I was there one time when Œ just after a 
V-1
 hit 
down  by 
Hy d e  P a rk
, and dug a big crater down th er
e. And th ey had had these guys 
that were like spit and argue
 club guys, or all these gu
ys down there complaining 
about the war and everything else, and yo
u know, just carrying on talking and 
yakking, I don™t know what they  believe
d in or anything, but it was kind of 
interesting to listen to him and Œ ya
kking and talking. And walk  around 
Hy de P a rk

and different place in 
London
 and I Œ interesting time. I 
Œ I thought I was Œ lost my 
arm there one time. I went in Œ I got a hote
l in Œ with  one of the other guys I was 
with, and we Œ I was laying in this bed,
 and it had a bar on the side of it and I 
somehow li Œ laid my  arm down at the side
 and that bar was right under my  arm, 
and it cut off my  circulation so my arm wa
s Œ went to sleep, and I woke up in  the 
morning and tried to move the arm, and it wasn™t there, and I reached over trying to 
find for it, it was hanging outside the bed, yo
u know, th at was kind of interesting. 
Then  mis Œ the people, I had no trouble 
with the people, I 
think was pleasant. 
Q: Did you make any Englis
h friends or girlfriends? 
A: No. 
Q: No? 
A: No. No, didn™t have time. 

Q: How much trai
ning did you do in 
England
 be-before Œ 
A: Well, quite a bit of training, because in
 Œ in the radio thing, the Americans had 
five letter code groups, they™d send grou
ps of five letters, and then  you had to  
decode Œ decipher that into
 real language, from the 
SOI
 standard operating 
procedures, and the British had four letter 
groups. So th e navigator and my self went 
to another base in 
England
 and trained Œ cross trained 
with the British, receiv ing 
their codes and stuff like that, and their di
ver Œ procedures that they had. So  we 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen  
 
April 26, 2013
 
 
 
 
13
went about th Œ I think it was a couple we
ek s of training, cross training with the 
British, then went back to base, cause Œ cau
se we were in a lot Œ with the British a 
lot, you know, naturally, we 
was in their country still. 
Q: What sort of aircraft did you have
, and where were you in that aircraft? 
A: I was the radio operator by th e center of
 the aircraft, just behind the bomb bays, 
and I had gun ab ove the head. And it was a 
B-17G
, we just got the 
Gs
 model in 
when I was there. And I always used to go
 down th e lines and see a lot of planes 
that come back were pretty shot up, and 
we wondered how they flew, and part of 
their tails missing and everything else, 
and big holes in them
, you know. And it was 
kind of interesting to see them
, you know, cause I was inquisitive. 
Q: Was it frightening? 
A: I never really seemed to get too excite
d about that. I always
 thought Œ I always 
figured that if the plane went down, my id
ea was I™d Œ I™d go down with it, and it™d 
crash and I™d get out of the crash somehow.
 Bu t my  mind changed wh en I got shot 
down . 

Q: First combat experience Œ first flew Œ no
 Œ not Œ what Œ your first flight that you 
went over the 
Channel
, what Œ when was that
, what was that like? 
A: I don™t remember the exact day that 
we had there. I think there was training 

flights that we went just to the coast, 
turn around, come back
, three of them. And 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

14
then on the day of the Œ th
e bomb, when I fir Œ when I was shot down, why we got 
up quite early in the mo rni
ng, ab out four o™clock or 
something like that, I don™t 
reme mb er the exact time. It was early. Had 
the briefing and then  we took off and we 
used to climb at certain altitudes 
[indeciphera ble]
 because you have a lot of 
airplanes up there. So they
 have a colored flares, and 
you have a Œ each plane has a 
different colored flare and they fire 
it off up there at altitude and then you 
rendezvous onto that group. That™s your de
finition, and you start from there on your 
mission. So, you climb to a pretty good
 altitude before you start to cross the 
Channel
. And it was interesting to, before that, that the 
V-1s
 that they were firing 
on 
England
, they were these kind of a putt, you 
hear them flapping, cause they had 
a Œ a pulse jet mo tor on them, and you™d hear
 those at night. And as long as they 
weren™t coming right over your
 head. Why? Because they 
didn™t steer them, they 
just had an angle, wherever
 they go, and then
 they would kick the rudder over and Œ 
the horizontal stabilizers rather, and they
 just dive straight down. The British 
developed a technique to k
eep those from coming into 
England
. They  had a fighter 
Œ real big fighters called nape Œ 
Typhoon
, with a 
Napier
 
Sabre
 big engine on it. 
Wasn™t Œ I guess it was too heav y to be a real good fighter like the 
Spitfire
. And 
they would send those out over the 
Channel
 w h en  th ey  h e ar 
Œ see these things 
coming in, cause they
 flew at a certain altitude, and the 
Typhoons
 would fly along 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen  
 
April 26, 2013
 
 
 
 
15
the side of them and flap the wing on th em 
and tip the gyro in, and they just spiral 
into the ocean. So 
the British really did a good 
job on downing many, many 
hundreds of those darn 
B-1s
. 
Q: It had to take some pre
tty skilled flying to do that. 
A: Yeah, well they just fly alongside. 
They were doing ab out maybe, I don™t know, 
300 miles an hour, 250 mile an hour, fly 
alongside and just flap the wing, you 
know, tip it a little bit. 
The Œ the Œ tip the gyro 
in the rocket and they  just spiral into 
the ocean. It was a clev er idea, you know, a
nd didn™t take Œ they didn™t fire on them 
because if they shot them, a
nd then they explode and you™
d fly right through all that 
debris. 
Q: Right. 
A: So it was a clever idea. Didn™t 
take mu ch you know, and the air Œ 
Typhoons
 
could catch them real easy. So I th
ought that was real clever, myself. 
Q: When  was the first time you, after your
 training, and after you did the coastal 
runs and wh at have you, 
that you crossed over the 
Channel
 and went on a comb at 
mission? 
A: Th-The Œ wh at day, you mean? 
Q: No, not necessarily day, but what was 
that experience like? Do you remember 
tha Œ going over for the first time? 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen  
 
April 26, 2013
 
 
 
 
16
A: Oh yeah, I remember going over and 
seeing the Œ the coastline and Œ and seeing 
some other planes wh ere ya Œ I think we 
took Œ some planes took wa Œ one hit Œ I 
remember over 
Ca la is
, 
France
, I think it was, one took a Œ took a direct hit in the 
bomb bay, it looked like, cause it just blew 
up, disappeared, you know. And then we 
went on to our target, it was a dru Œ it was 
an underground airbase, fighter base, and 
they had caves and stuff in these hills 
where they™d put th
e fires inside, and 
everything was camouflaged, so it was a hard 
thing to find, but th
ey were trying to 
knock out as mu ch of those fighters as 
they could because of the invasion fo rces, 
you know. So we made a 
Œ went out and found the initial point, which is an 
identifiable point that you Œ they can find 
to turn on, and they
 drove cer Œ certain 
altitudes, certain speed and in a certain dir
ection, and to the target. We met the first 
time and that Œ the bomb ardier couldn™t fi
nd the target, camouflaged. So you do a 

no-no, we Œ we made a 360 degree turn an
d went back  to same initial point and 

started the same course, same altitude, sa
me everything. By that time the barrage 
flak that you see all the time hadn't got us
 the first time, so th
ey had their tracking 
flak on us in. They knew ou
r altitude, our course, they kn
ew where we were going. 
So the tail gunner says, about 300 yard s o
ff the tail, had a burst. Next one through 
the waist, and the left wing wen-went off, 
and we caught on fire
 and started into a 
spiral. And I always figured I™d ride the 
airplane down , get out of the crash or

something. But you change yo
ur mind rather quickly  when 
that happens, so I Œ guys 
just bailing out, you know, wh en  they gave 
the order to bail out. And I started out of 
the radio room and heard the ball turret g
unner was spinning around, so I figure the 
communications were shot out or somethi
ng, so I grabbed a big tuner, you know, 
the transmitter in the radio room and starte
d beating on top of it.
 And he pointed the 
guns down  and the handles come up and I 
flipped it out and he pops out. He was a 
little guy, and he popped out of there so qui
ck  I couldn™t believe it. Hand him his 
parachute, he sta Œ snappe
d it on and boy he was out th
e win Œ out the door. I was 
right behind him. 
Q: What altitude were you at
 when you bailed, roughly? 
A: What Œ what else did I take? 

Q: What al-altitude were 
you at when you bailed? 
A: Was about Œ I think ab
out 27,000 - 27 five Œ 
Q: So you were up. 
A: Huh? 
Q: You were up. 

A: We were about Œ ab ou
t 30,000 we started. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But we were in a dive, sort
 of a spiral dive, you know.

Q: Yeah. 
A: So. 

Q: What was that experience like, bailing out? 
A: I didn™t have too much, I guess the exc
itement, and all that stuff, that you don™t 
think about it, I was ju st tryi
ng to get out of that fiery ai
rplane. And so we™d always 
been told to delay your ju
mp , cause they may Œ may shoot you coming down  in the 
parachute, you know, a fight
er come by, or something like that. So I had delayed 
my parachute til I could kind of see the l
eaves on the trees. And I popped the chute 
and it seemed like I took a couple swings 
and I was on the ground. And then  there 
was a Œ a little boy, a lady, and a Œ at the 
end of this field where I landed in, there 
was a little boy over there and 
a lady, and so I Œ he ran over towards me and I 
reached in my kneepad
s to get my escape kit out an

, and maps and stuff. 
And he pointed the 
[indecipherable]
 
in the book, and he says hide, in there. 
So they took off. So 
I stuck my parachute 
under some bushes there at the edge of the 
field, and ran through the forest and got 
to the other side and I didn™t know goin
g to the other side is that I was getting 
deeper in the forest, but I 
come to a clearing. Now th
at little boy don™t want to go 
out in there, cause gonna see me. So I just
 heard these Œ all these Germans running,

you could hear them, and th ere™s Œ their canis
ter they carry with them is Œ their gas 
mask rattles like a tin can, yo
u know, so I heard rattling, so
 I just dove under some 
bushes right there and pulled th em down kind of
 over me and laid there, waited, and 
hear when the Germans come up, he™s Œ I co
uld reach out and grab his pant leg, he 
was so close, but he was l
ooking way out ahead, he wasn™t
 looking down  at his feet. 
And I don™t know, it seemed like I laid ther
e for a day, it was probably an hour or 
something like that, and he 
kept looking out there, and I 
didn™t breathe for a couple 
hours, I don™t think. Bu t anyhow, they fi
nally went away and then I just walked 
through the forest and Œ and I got my  maps
 and th ere Œ they had maps that they 
gave you were like a silk handkerchief, but 
their maps w ere detailed, they had the 
curves in the road, you could see paths in
 the forest, and they had Œ I don™t know 
where I got them, but they we
re very good. So I saw a 
curve in the road and it™s 
where I was at, and I located myself and then
 I started out to cross this one road, a 
divided highway. And then I heard a big rack
et coming, I was right in the middle of 
it, it was quite wide, their divided highway wa
s, and there™s grass and s Œ lot of trees 
growing in the middle of it. And around th
e corner I get Œ hear them coming. So I 
dove into  the grass and hear a bunch of
 German tanks and ev erything else was 
coming by, and guys in, I don™t know, lo
oked like armo red cars or something, I 
didn™t Œ I wasn™t able to really look, I wa
s Œ buried my self in the grass, hoping th ey

didn™t see me. And they went on 
by, didn™t see me, so I thought
[indecipherable]
 
get out of here, so I headed  back. And every time I seen 
one walking, I would ju st 
veer off at an angle. I wouldn™t walk cl
ose to them, cause th
ey™d see me, identify 
me. So I just kept quite a ways away, and veer off at an angle. I never made any 
sharp turn s or quick turn s or anything like th at
, and finally I came to this forest area, 
and I ran across an old deserted Œ I don™t know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but 

it was pretty dilapidated. So I went in th
ere cause it had been raining, and I got all 
wet and stuff like that. So I took off my
 coveralls, cause I had coveralls with 
suspenders and stuff, my flight
 suit. So hung up 
on the thing in the top of it there, 
and laid down on th e straw, 
and went to bed. And then  the next mo rning, early the 
next mo rning, I don™t know, seven Œ six, seven o™clock, or wh at time it was, but I 
heard crack Œ like sticks breaking, and stuff 
like that, and I peek out. Here is a g uy 
out there, I thought he was an old man, it 
looks pre Œ he was probably 40 years old, 
cause I was only 19. And so  I didn™t know 
what to do, I had my
 .45 automatic, pil Œ 
you know, shoulder holster and sa Œ I sa
ys, I don™t know whether to shoot at the 
guy, or make a noise in the Œ I had to ma
ke a decision real quick here. So I thought 
no, I stuck th e gun in  the straw, and I 
stepped out to the door, pulled the Œ and 
peeked  out to him. And he put his finger up
 to his mouth like be quiet. And he says 
[indecipherable]
. I didn™t know French, but I 
thought that meant friend or

something. So he says, shh. So  he left. 
And so about 10 - 15 minutes later, here he 
co me b ack . S t arted  mo tio n i ng  me to  co me w
ith him. So I reluctan
tly went with  him. 
Q: Did you take your weapon with
 you or leave it in the straw? 
A: No, I left it in the straw. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I didn™t want to be caught with it beca
use I™d always been told , if you wi Œ get 
with the French underg round 
Œ and I didn™t know who it 
was, they didn™t know me 
either, why, if you don™t do exactly wh at 
they say, they™ll shoot you. You know, 
because they don™t k
now who you are either. Maybe an
 infiltrator. So I figure it™s 
best just to not take the chance, I™ll just l
eave the gun there. So 
I left it in the straw 
and went with him, and we walk ed thro ugh
 the forest quite a ways, maybe a mile it 
seemed lik e. And came to a house and went 
to the back hou Œ of
 the house, it was a 
fence Œ brick, like brick fence, but half of 
it was torn down so th
at wh en we stepped 
over that, went into  the house. And th
e family Œ I took my concentrated 
[indecipherable]
 my  escape kit, and gave it to them. And th ey made me hot 
chocolate and brought it to me
 an d breakfast in the morn
ing. I stayed there about 
three days. One time the German came to look
 Œ I Œ I guess just watch Œ looking for 
people, and they hid me out in
 the pigpen out in
 the back. And then
 they brought me 
back in, I stayed th
ere. And then  they brought a Œ 
a couple of Œ a guy who had a

Œ he gave me fresh

A: Three days. 

Q: Three days, okay. 

A: And Œ 

Q: Did you know th eir names? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er their names. I 
wish I did, but I don™t remember their 
names. They had a Œ a young lady there, th
eir daughter I guess it was, that used to 
bring the warm cereal and kind of coffee and 
Œ kind of an ersatz type coffee, I don™t 
know, it was of str Œ strange ta Œ 
Q: Chicory? 

A: Yeah, like that. And that was Œ I was trea
ted real well there and they Œ like I had 
a nice bed, and stuff like that. And then, you know, I rode away 
with  this guy, he 
took me to another house, and that was Madam 
Marie Duvall
(ph). I remember her 
name. And there I met a Œ well, a pilot, 
Jim Fore
(ph). 
Q: Really?

A: Yeah, he was there. And so, I was rea
lly surprised to see him, you know, but I 
guess they were all in the underground group there, yo
u know, and we all lit in  a 
certain area there. Anyway
, here I met him, and Œ 
Q: I don™t suppose you had occasion at that
 point to question his circling around and 
doing th at bomb run again? 

A: No. No, no, no, no. No, yo
u Œ you know, they said they

we gotta take out these Œ these fighter bases 
and stuff like that. Caus
e they told us in

at you™re assigned to do. 
So if you made the decision, make a 360,
 why, he knew mo re about it and wh at Œ 
what was going on than  I did, he 
and the bombardier, so you know, I Œ 
Q: Did he recognize you straig

A: Oh, oh yeah, sure. We gave
 each other a hug, you know. And we stayed there a 

few days and th e lady, Madame

s a basement, and

eel cart, a horse drawn two

with him, and we rode through a ho Œ 
little Œ down a road and then 
turn a corner, went to a

German tanks there, and soldiers, everythi

German Œ in French tams and stuff, in civ

nchalant, you know, riding with this guy, 
cause if they™d 
[indecipherable]
 he™d have been shot right away to o, you know. 
Q: Sure. 

A: So, we tried to be as calm as possible,
 and anyway, he took us to this house, li-
like a sa Œ let™s see, we were at Madame 
Marie
 
Duvall™s
(ph) house, and then  we 
went from there to a Œ I-I don™t know, a man 
and a lady had a house and they  lived 
in there, and there the Œ we were suppos
ed  to be picked up 
by so meone and taken 
south of 
Paris
 cause th ey™d supposedly made a
rrangements to come in with an 
A-

 and pick us up south of 
Paris
. They ™re going to  light up a field out there, a hay 
field or something. And a plane was supposed
 to come in and pi
ck us up. So they 
took us to another house, we stayed ther
e a few days, and they Œ they  had nothing 
but wine to drink. And I got so thirsty fo
r some water, we went out to the Œ where 
they had a well outside there, and starte
d pulling up th e water from the well, and the 
French guy come out and said, no, no, no, 
he said Œ I guess he thought it was poison 
or something or not with Œ fit to drink, you know. Bu t man, I Œ if you™d been 

drinking just their white wine for a f-few 
days why your Œ get 
Œ get so thirsty for

out later he was a traitor, he was a Belgian 
F-French guy, and he was getting paid so 
much a head for all the people
 he turned in to the ga Œ 
the Germans. And so we got 
in this car, this 
Citroën
 Œ oh, in the meantime, and Œ 
this house we were at, they 
brought another kid there, he was a Œ from a 
Wellington
 bomber, a British kid from 
a 
Wellington 
bomber. So it was 
Jim Fore
(ph), myself and 
th is guy from the 
Wellington
 bomber. And so  they Œ we 
got in the ba
ck of this 
Citroën
, and th e Œ the 
guy had a hat too big for him, kind of
 bug eyed little guy, 
and Œ and he had a 
redheaded  woman with him, and a kid maybe 
10 - 12 years old in the front seat with 
him. We drove into  
Versailles

Versailles

we were kind of shaken . An yway, we went Œ 
then he left them there, we went into 
Paris
. We ended up getting driven right into
 Gestapo headquarters. So, kind of 
surprised. So they Œ we we
nt Œ they had the machine guns
 all a round, and then we 
separated so Œ we walked up 
these stairs, second floor 
and down  the hall, and the 
other Germans there, they™re standing agains

separated 
Jim
 and I and I don™t know where the 
prin Œ the British 
kid go Œ went 
either, but I know 
Jim
 and I were on th e same floor up
 there, but he was in another 
room. And I went into this room, there wa
s a lady and a German guy there, and he 
spoke English, and she was taking Œ writing a
ll this stuff down. An
d so they started, 
you know, searching us and stuff like that
. And I had my  wristw
atch and Œ and Œ up 
around my  arm, up here. But they took my
 dog tags, I had them in my  shoes and 
they took everything, just to
ok everything off of us, you know, and Œ and put it in a 
si Œ in a Œ a ba Œ a bag there, in a big 
envelope. And I said, can I write my  name on 
it or something like that? And he says no 
need, bury you in 
two days. But they 
didn™t put my name on it. And th-the watc
h I had was not my military watch, it was 
issue watch, but Œ cause I had given that to
 the navigato r cause that day he said his 
watch didn™t work, and so I had mine and 
I had a gold  watch that my  mo ther had

I wo re it. But I had slipped it up here 
around my  elbow. Anyway, took everythi
ng. So, from then on, I Œ I don™t know, 
they just took us back and fi

 took us to French  prison. You ev er

A: No, no Œ it was Œ it was not 
Œ not too bad. They  ask us
 questions, they would be 
kind of firm about it, and he had a revol
ver laying right besi
de him on his desk. I 
guess that was kind of to be a threat to us
 or something like that. But I don™t know, I 
didn™t pay much attention to it, all I 
gave him was name, rank and serial number. 
And it wasn™t til I got over to Fr-French pris

other interrogation took place that this Germ

no and started to holler and come out from 
behind th e desk, started kicking at me, and 
a couple of guards 
outside the door there 
grabbed me and put Œ I was 
put in a Œ a little b ox, it was about maybe two or three 
feet square, metal box, for about 24 hours. 
And then, th e next day, why th ey took 
me out in the courtyard of Œ and lined me 
up in front of the fi
ring squad. They  had 
about five guys there, four or five guys
 with rifles and za Œ the German officers, 
couple of them there, and they were ho
llering at me and asking me questions and 
stuff. And I thought I was already dead, so 
I just, again, I gave them my main Œ 
name, rank and serial number, and I just st
ood there and looked  at them. Cause I 
thought I was already dead,

reason and I just Œ I Œ I Œ I don™t know wh

difference. And they  just stormed around th
ere for a while, stomping their feet and 
hollering. They had a guy 
with a British accen t, was asking questions. And they 
wanted to  know squadron, and all that good
 stuff. They  had all that data, I found out 
later. But, anyway, they finally
 gave up and put me back 
in a cell, an d I went in a 
cell for 38 days in solitary, and Œ 
Q: Thir Œ how many days? 

A: Thirty-eight. 
Q: What was on the paper he wanted you to sign? 
A: I don™t know, I couldn™t read it, it was 
in German. So I Œ I was always told, you 
know, they™ll give you papers, try to sign 
something, ev erything else. They ™ll even 
have a Red Cross on it, to think sir Œ fro
m the Red Cross or something. We were 
told that by intelligence peop
le, you know, that they ha
d this Œ all these things 
going, so  I just Œ but me, I wasn™t going 
to sign anything. You could have signed 
your death warrant, you don™t know wh at 
you™re signing, you kno
w, or confessions 
or something like that. So I just didn™t sign 
it, and dil Œ I gotta say, he got a little 
upset over that, but Œ and put me in solitary
 and then they would come in Œ th-the 
old prison, I don™t know if you know ab out Fr
ench prison, they ha
ve the ol-old type 
doors. The doors are about three inches th
ick, I think, wo oden  doors, you know, and 
they had this little trap door

 they could open and slide a

bowl of soup in to you. An
d tha Œ and that, they had a litt
le peephole, and they had a 
Œ one light on th e side of this, in the room 
there, that they coul
d turn on a switch on 
the outside and light the light, and in th
e corner you had a little carved out place 
there in cement, that had a 
little water spigot, and that wa
s the toilet also there. And 
had straw on Œ on the fl Œ you know, a little
 p lace for you to sleep. Anyway, I Œ 
they™d  Œ they™d come by and 
flip that light on and that
 little Œ you could hear them 
peeking Œ that little thing and 
peeking at you, you know, ev
ery once in a while. So I 
decided th at I didn™t like it. I don™t know w
hy I did it, but I took my little soup bowl 
I had, they put in there, and I propped it up
 on this little shelf in
 there so it covered 
their peek hole. Shouldn™t ha
ve done that. Anyway , come 
along, pe Œ turn ed on the 
light, I guess, and couldn™t see in. And boy, 
I heard the awful-est racket you ever 
heard out there. There™s guys running, and 
you could hear their 
canisters clanging, 
their gas masks things and ev erything. Pre
tty soon they 
opened the door, about two 
or three of them are there, and they come
 in and started knocking me all around the 
room, and Œ trying to teach me a lesson, 
you know. And then they  left. And I was Œ 
and I spen t my  time picking fleas, because th
ey had lice, or fleas in there, and the 
fleas would get in the seams of your clot
hes, you know, and 
as a good pastime, 
cause they™d  bite you all over, and I was 
taking Œ you could fe
el along, little hard 
things and you™d crunch them
, you™d break th eir shells, 
you know. So that was our

pastime. A nd then we™d tap on the wall, ca
use there were other prisoners there. And 
there were some points you coul
d tap and you could read  the 
Mo rse 
code there. So 
you knew there were other American prison
ers there or something, you know, cause 
they™d tap back, you know. 
So  just spent your pastime that way. Once I was Œ 
Q: What did you talk about? 

A: Just a Œ trying to  ask questions. They  
heard something like they were bombing at 
night, and you™d hear people screaming,
 women and men and y
ou heard noises all 
night long, you hear sh Œ 
gunshots, you don™t know wh
at was going on. And I heard 
later they were probably torturing people ou
t there, you know, the ai Œ they Œ cause 
they had a lot of the French underg round pe
ople they™d caught also. And once I was 
taken out to a little courtyard, you had a wa
 Œ a kind of a balcon
y thing up there, 
where the guard kept walking back and fo
rth. And then they had this little area 

there, and you walk around some, I guess th
at was your exercise room, you know. It 
was Œ it was penned in, but it was about prob
ably 20 feet square, you could just 
walk around this little path
 around the square for exercise. And you could see 
carvings on the wall where people had been
 there from the 1800
s or something like 
that. It™s an old, old prison, but all the 
limesto ne walls, people scratched their names 
and stuff in it, you know, it was kind of intr
iguing to see all the people that had 

probably been there before. Cause 
it™s an old, old prison, so Œ for 
France
. And

anyway, finally, when  you got, I guess as
 Œ Americans were about, I don™t know, 
who knows, 12 - 15 miles away, maybe ma 
Œ further, but there was shelling going 
on, you could hear it all night lo ng, the 
cannons and stuff. And then it started 
getting pretty noisy. And so , all of a s
udden the Œ they  ev acua
ted us, took us out, 
took us all and put us in those boxcars. 
And they putting 90 of 
us in one of those 
boxcars, and we had to stand up. And they  
put a barrel in the center, cut off half a 
barrel and th at was a toilet and everything
, you know, sloshing around th ere. And so  

they Œ we didn™t know where we were going,
 you know, we thou
ght we were going 
to be taken out of there to a 
POW
 camp, or something, you know, but we ended up 
going so  far and then  we came to a t
unnel. And apparently the Americans or 
someone 
[indeciphera ble]
 someone had bomb ed the tu
nnel shut. And so we were 
in there for quite a few hours, and it got 
smoky and really bad. And so Œ then  they  
took us all Œ all these boxcars and ma
de us take the German, I don™t know, 
backpacks and boxes and th in
gs that we carry clothing
. And we walk Œ followed 
them down a road and then 
across a bridge to the other side of this river, up th e 
other side, and then we went through a 
little village and the Œ 
the French people 
were out there throwing us apples and 
some food and stu
ff like that. And the 
Germans were trying to keep them from 
it, but they™d still 
throw the stuff, you 
know, and we™d catch 
something. And then  we got to a train on th e other side where

the tunnel had Œ was Œ was Œ you know, wh
ere the tunnel had been closed, we Œ 
they had backed a train up at the other side
. We boarded  th at train and went onto Œ 
we didn™t know where we™re going, but I guess we got to 
F ra n kfurt
, I think, 
Germany
. But before we got there, was going up a hill or something, it™s kind of 
slow, and the tru Œ the boxcar right behind
 us, the Œ th-the g
uys had pried a board 

out of the bottom of the Œ I found out late
r, pried Œ and the guys
 were dropping out 
between the railroad tracks. 
And then, when the train wa
s going up a hill, slowing 
down , why they™d  drop between the tracks
 and roll out between the wheels to get 
out from under there, because they had thes
e scrapers that would go between it. So 

a few of the guys got out. I heard later on 
Œ I don™t know this to be a fact, but I 
heard later on th at one guy from 
Texas
, he really escaped. He™s the only guy I ever 
heard of ac-actually got away. So Œ but ki
nd of a dangerous th
ing to do, but you 
know, was trying to  get out of there, and 
then the Œ the one tim
e they Œ they Œ a 
French kid in our box car was hanging on
 one of the vents. On the opposite Œ 
cattywampus
 corners of the boxcar they had a ve
nt about maybe eight or 10 inch es 
high and about two feet long fo r a vent. Th
ey had barbed  wire 
strung across it. And 
there was this French kid, 
he™s about 18 years old, I gue
ss, or so Œ fif Œ 14 - 15, I 
don™t know how old he was. And he had hi
s hand up on this barbed wire, holding 
onto it, cause we were standing up in th

shot him right through the hand. And that™s 
kind of crazy, you know, he™s already in 
there. And anyway, then they stopped th
e car, they took him out. And Œ oh, before 
that, by the way, when thes
e guys dropped out between 
the railroad tracks, they 
stopped the train, and they took about, I 
don™t know, it must ha
ve been 10 or 15 

guys out there beside the boxcar, lined th
em up like they were
 going to shoot them 
Œ cause we could look out through the cr
acks and see them, a
nd they looked like 
they were going to shoot th em, and then this German officer was hollering at them 
and stuff like that. And then we
 were told that there Œ ev
ery time Œ if anyone tried to 
escape they were going to k
ill 15 guys for every one that 
tried to escape. So they 
were trying to quiet us down , I guess. I 
wasn™t going anywhere. An d they took th is 
young kid out, I was surprised. And I wa
s looking out a crack in that boxcar. The 
German officer told him to Œ kind of mo
tioned him down  there. The tracks were 
raised, kind of sloped on the side, down  to
 Œ there™s a f Œ some fields down there, 
have been plowed and 
stuff. And there™s a little irriga
tio n ditch along the edge of it. 
I looked down and I though
t well, this German officer motioned this kid down 
there, I thought that he was going to ha
ve him go down, wash 
his hand off, cause it 
was bleeding and stuff like that. But as so
on as he turned ar
ound, this German 
officer shot him right through th e back. An
d the kid laid down  
and kind of kicked 
like, and one of the other guards there ju
st raked him with a machine gun. And Œ

and then  they took a co uple of guys out 
of the boxcar and gave them shovels and 
made them go down there by the Œ right down
 close to that little 
ditch down there, 
and they Œ they weren™t ther
e very long. They dug a hole, and I don™t think th e thing 
was two feet deep. Threw this little kid in
 there and covered him up. And I thought, 
the mother will never know where th
at kid is. Cause who knows today Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: Œ wh at happened to  him, you know? Ca
use I thought boy, how cruel can you be? 
He™s already in a prison, you know, in the 
ca Œ there, and why™d they shoot him in 
the hand in the first place? It
™s just do Œ I think it showed 
Œ to try to warn us, don™t 
try anything. That™s what I assumed, y
ou know? And anyway , we
 went on and we 
were kind of shocked, I was anyway . I think 
all of us were that Œ we pulled up in Œ 
on this railroad place in front of this fence,
 got out. All these stripy clothes prisoners 
in there, and dogs and they herd
 us into this camp, and it was 
Buchen wald
 
concen tration camp. 
Q: When  you arrived, where did you th ink you had arrived? 
A: I didn™t know at first, I didn™t even 
know about the camp, a
nd I thought we were 
going to  a 
POW 
camp. This was my assumption, y
ou know, cause we™d always told 
they™d  take you to 
Dulag Luft
 or something, and interrog
ate you and then take you 
to prisoner of war camp. But we were kind
 of shocked when  we arrived there, cause

we saw, you know, that sign out there 
on the gate says, wor-wor-work will make 
you free, in German, and saw th e Œ allthe dogs, and th ese German guards and 
there™s skinny prisoners in 
there, you know, and Œ and a
ll the striped clothes. And 
since we got in there some of the prisone
rs come up and pretty soon they started 
telling Œ and in English, a few of them 
spoke English, and Œ or it was relayed 
through some of the guys that Œ we ha
d one guy in our gr
oup that spoke Œ 
Ben 
Sharf
(ph) was a ger Œ spoke German real
 well. And so he said, we™re in 
Buchen wald
 concentration camp. And then they to
ok us in and stripped all of our 
clothes off of us and put us in a shower-
like thing, you know, a
nd we come out, we 
didn™t know wh at was going on. And then  
they shaved  every hair off of our body 
and then  sw abbed us with so
mething like creosote that set us on fire, you know, and 
you ben Œ you was da
ncing around, jumping and si Œ 
cause it was burning, ju-just 
like it™s peeling the skin o
ff, you know. And then they 
brought us down a little fu-
further and they started handing us some
 clothing. I was given a wo man™s silk 
blouse, and a pair of like silk slacks, or
 wo men™s slacks or something, real thin 
things, no shoes, no socks, no nothing. Th
ey took everything we had away, our 
other clothes, before we went in the show
er. We went in  the shower, we thought we 
were going to the gas chamber or somethin
g, you know, cause we™d heard stories 
about that stuff. But anyway, we

at Œ and they just finally

herd us down to  an area and left us ther
e, we were outside on a ro ck pile. And I 
don™t know, we were there I don™t know 
how many days. But at night it was getting 
cold, so we™d all hover around, and cuddle 
up together, you know, to try to stay 
warm, and Œ 

Q: You were out of do
ors during th e nights? 
A: Yeah, out-outside, and a Œ kind of a ro
ck  pile area there. And then we Œ one day 
we saw Œ we heard this noise, we look up in
 the air and hear a Œ about 30,000 feet 
or so up there was a whole bunch of
 bomb ers coming over, you know, you could 
see the contrails behind them. And they we
re Œ looked like they
 were coming right 
at us. We said, holy mackerel, you know, I hope they ™re not going to  drop those 

things on us. And all of a sudden they popp
ed a flair, like a lead bombardier always 
pops a flair and they  s Œ the group tightens their formation, and th ey make a nice 
pattern. So we thought, holy mackerel, he
re they co me. And all of a sudden you 
heard this ru Œ it™s Œ if you ever heard 
bomb s coming down, they  fi Œ sound like a 
freight train coming down the track, and 
there™s a little whistle
 going on to them, 
and they™re just shredder and rattling like 
a freight train comi
ng in, you know. And 
all of a sudden Œ and they started landing 
below, and we thought, boy, they ™re going 
to get us here. But not one bomb lit inside th
e Œ the fence. They blew part of the Œ 
the fence down, but they we
re bombing th e underground fa
ctory that Œ where all the

wor Œ the slave labor was used. And that was a 
V-2
, 
V-2
, gyros and factories for 
ammunition and stuff like that there. So 
we were relieved and Œ you know, they 
didn™t drop it on us. But they Œ a
pparently they 
went down the 
SS
 barracks, took out 
about 2,000 
SS 
guys and Œ and gutted the wh ole place with Œ they  first went in with 
explosives and then  they dr
opped incendiaries after that. 
Then they dropped leaflets. 
I saw one of the leaflets, but they starte
d shooting at people that picked up th e 
leaflets, so there were Œ but there were s
till a few prisoners got 
ahold of leaflets. I 
saw one of them later. It
 showed  a picture of a 
B-17
 and a silhouette of a 
B-29
, 
showed how much
 bigger the 
B-29
 was and that we warn ed
 the Germans that they 
were going to start using these planes on th
em if they don™t surrender, and stuff like 
that, you know, and Œ and it showed how Am
ericans treat German prisoners of war, 
and stuff, it showed them in mess halls a
nd stuff like that. And 
they Œ and then had 
a thing and they were trying 
to invite the pr Œ us prisoners to join them and fight 
against the Russians. And they  give us extr
a benefits or something. You know, this 
kind of crazy thing.  

Q: Were you made to work ? 

A: They tried to Œ th ey come up and ask us wh at our profession was, what we could 
do and stuff like that, and all of said we 
were students. We already had agreed to 
this before, we were going to say they were all students. And so we Œ we held  by

38
that, and they Œ it made them pretty ma
d that we didn™t tell them we had any 
professions other than just students and f
liers. So we Œ none of us worked, we all 
refused to work. So Œ I don™t 
know if that was a good idea or not, but we weren™t Œ 
didn™t seem be punished  any mo re for 
it, you know. And they finally Œ we were 
living outside, like I say, on
 the rocks out there. And on
e day Œ and there were a lot 
of these little Gypsy kids, 
you™ve heard about them pr
obably. I don™t know how 
many, there were hundreds of them around 
there. And you had to  watch, because if 
you had any food left at a
ll, you have some, once in a wh ile, about once a week , you 
get about three little Œ real sm
all, little baked potatoes, ha
lf rotten, but they™d been 
boiled, you know. It was bette
r than nothing. And if one 
of Œ if you had piece of 
those left, they™d steal it, those poor little 
Gypsy kids that were running around, they 
were hungry, you know, and they steal a
nything that wasn™t tied down. And they 
were in a barracks there, and one day, it 
seemed like to me, th
ey all disappeared. 
And they  come down and got 
us and gave us that barrack
s. And I used to think, oh 
my, what™d they do, did th
ey kill them all? They 
[indecipherable]
 their camp, what 
happened to them? I st
ill to this day don™t know really
 what all happened to those 
poor little kids. But they 
were little Œ you know, from 
Latvia
,
 Lithua nia
,
 Estonia
, 
all the eastern countries that
 they picked th em up, th
eir parents were probably 
killed, and they brought th
em in there. But that was Œ that™s been kind of a

disturbing thing all my life, the Œ what ha
ppened to those poor
 little kids, you know. 
But we wer Œ we got the barracks and Œ an
d we were fortunate to get those, you 
know, and then we were there I don™t know
 how lo ng and we got a bowl of grass 
soup every day, you know,
 and three Œ we got about three little potatoes once a 
week or so, and Œ and then 
they brought in some Œ a 
barrel one time of la Œ like 
little sardines, they were just
 in saltwater, they were 
raw things, you know, dead, 
but Œ and were in saltwater, 
real heavy brine saltwater. A
nd of course we ate those 
things like crazy. And w-we associated w
ith all the other prisoners. There was a Œ 
right near Œ across from our barracks was a 
Polish barracks, and one day there was a 
big scuffle over there, you saw a whole b
unch of them piling on some guy, and you 
wonder what happened. Well, lat er on I fo
u Œ h-heard that this one Polish guy had 
been at another camp, and apparently he 
had been a snitch or something like that. 
And I don™t know if it was a fake, or wh at, 
but they said he knocked a bowl of soup 
out of one of the guy™s hands. So a bunch 
of them jump ed on him and put a blanket 
over his head and slugged hi
m to death. It was just, you know, dog eat dog ty pe 
attitude. And then they had th
ese guys, you maybe heard of 
ka po s
, they were called 
ka po s
. These were German prisoners, but they 
had given them special rations to be 
Œ and they  were all big guys, and th ey™d  
give them a big board  or a club, like a 
baseball bat, and they were to keep  us ot
her prisoners in line, to obey orders you

know. Line up, do th is, to go here. So ev
erybody tried to stay away from those 
ka po s
. And so Œ but I used to talk to so
me of the Polish g
uys over there spoke 
English, and you Œ I don™t know if 
you™ve ever heard of the esso Œ 
SOE 
guys, they 
were British and Œ and some of them wereScottish, most of them British. But they 
were secret type guys, operations guys th
at were dropped behind the German lines 
to do sabotage and stuff. And they were abou t Œ oh, there must have been 30 or so 

of them in there, 35 or 40. And one day 
they  took Œ took Œ I heard Œ I don™t know 
how many, but th Œ 17 
of them went into 
Weimar
, and I guess were tried, they 
brought them back and killed them. And late
r on they killed all the other guys. But I 
used to talk to some of those guys, 
and I found out two of them were from 
Scotland
, th ey were twins, and one had had a sc
ar up in his shoulder, and they put a 
scar on the other one™s shoulder just lik
e it. And th ey had Œ one would be up in  
Bremen
, up in northern 
Germany
, another would be down  in 
Munich
 and 
something would happen, a bi
g explosion or so mething wo
uld happen, they™d  catch 
this guy and Œ cause he was there, and he
 had the evid ence, because you know, he™d 
be Œ be real obvious around someplace, 
and he said no, I was, you know, here. I 
wasn™t there. And here that 
they Œ they finally coupled th
e fact together that this Œ 
they were twins, and the Germans finally 
caught them both. And later on they were 

both killed. They killed all those 
SOE 
guys, the British guys. 
And the Russian guys

Œ I used to talk to some of
 the Russians, they™d
 speak a little bit of English, and one 
of them used to tell 
me all the time that 
America
 would never surv ive because we 
produced so many airplanes and stuff lik
e that, and we would financially and 
everything, fold after the war, that we c
ouldn™t stand all that production, and stuff 
like that. A few little conversa
tions like that we had with
 the Russians, you know, 
that did speak some English. And th ey Œ 
I don™t know if you™ve ever seen the 
[indecipherable]
 but I didn™t know til after the 
war that they had a building up 
there, the Russians, a lot of them disappe
ared . They would take them up there and 
there was a like a Œ a medical examination. 
They™d stand them on some scales, and 
they had a hole right behind 
the scales, there in the wall,
 and a gun back there, and 
they™d turn around lik
e that, and shoot them right thro
ugh the back  of the head . And 
they eliminated a whole bunch of Russian
s that way by Œ by make Œ make them 
think they were giving them a medical, th
ey were standing on th e scale, then bam, 
they™re gone. And the crematorium there wa
s Œ I™ve been there a few times after the 
war, after I been out of ther
e, and they still have the 
hooks on the wall where they 
used to hang the prisoners, and they w
ould cut them, their legs and bodies, and 

bleed Œ let the blood drain out of them into
 the drain, because 
then they would burn 
them in the crematorium upstairs, and they
 had these little trollie
s th at they™d lay 
them on and wheel them up there, and then
 wheel them into these chambers up

there, had ab out, I don™t know, eight or 
10 of these cremation chambers up there, 
wheel them in there and cremate them. 
Cause they had bodies stacked by the 
crematorium all day long. The Œ used to se
e so mu ch inhumanity to man, that you 
couldn™t understand. You™re already a pris
oner, and you™d be sta Œ we™d stand up 
there Œ we counted Œ they called it 
appel
. My  numb er was 78,336, but Œ and we 
weren™t tattooed, and 
we used to ask the 
ka po s
, the fa Œ the 
ka po s 
told us that we 
were not tattooed because we were trading 
material. I guess Œ we Œ we assume d that 

that was going to be trading for German
 prisoners, you know, that we™re Œ we 
captured or something. We didn™t Œ and kno
w Œ don™t really know to this day what 
it was all about, why we weren™t tattooed.
 Bu t there were about Œ later on I found 
there were about, probably abou
t 50,000 prisoners there, you know 
[indecipherable]
 78,000, but they were dying off 
so fast, and I later fi Œ learned 
after the war that Œ from the archives at 
Buchenwald
 that the diet was designed to 
starve you to death in  about three months
. Keep cycling prisoners through there, 
cause they needed
 ru Œ labor, slave labor
 to work in 
the pri Œ in the factories and 
stuff, you know? So that was one way of ju
st getting rid of them, starve them to 
death, rather than shoot them, or some 
go to Œ took energy 
and took people. I™ve 
heard all sorts of rumo rs, I don™t know why,
 but I don™t know. I™ve heard that the Œ 
they used to lie in the Œ

up by ga Œ by th ese pits and they ™d shoot th
em and drop in the pits and they ™d  cover 
them up. Bu t the people that had to mo w th em down, those people had mental 
problems because they didn™t Œ you know, 
they were killing other humans. So that™s 
why the gas chambers came into
 being, so much. That was to Œ cause it wasn™t such 
a personal thing. So  Œ but it™s 
[indecipherable]
 because when we stand up for 
appel
 to be counted, these 
SS
 guys would stand up there, they count your head s, 
and they  had to have the count right in ca
mp  before they would ex cuse you, go back 
to the barracks, or where yo
u™re gonna go. Some
times it™d take three hours, and it Œ 
guys Œ some of the guys were Œ I weighed 
82 pounds when I got out of there, s-
some of the guys were skinnier than I was,
 couldn™t stand up. A
nd you™d try to help 
them stand up, and th e 
SS
 guys would wade in there a
nd knock his brains out with  a 
rifle butt, and make the prisoners put him 
on a gunny sack, four of them carry him 
over and stack him by the bodies by th e crem
atorium now. So it™s just Œ and there 

was these two wheel carts running around 
all day, picking up bodies and hauling 
them to the crematorium. So it was just not
 a very good environment. And you ju st 
wonder Œ I used to wonder about how can 
people be so  cruel, and just Œ you™re 
already prisoners, you know
, why make it even wo rse? But we had a guy whose 
name the ger Œ the German 
SS
 guy up there was named 
Hauptm an
. And he would 
stand up there when we were out there, a
nd ge Œ weather got ki
nd of cool, and he

had a little bucket, and he had a little cup in
 it, and he™d say Œ he™d pull back his 
unifo rm, show he had woolen underwear u
nderneath. And he™d  say, cold, cold ? And 
then he™d  throw Œ take a s-scoop up a bucket 
of this water Œ a scoop of this water 
and throw it out over us, you know, like sp
ray us, you know, with a little bit of 
water. He™d say cold? He just kind of to
rmented, you know. I don™t know wh at he 
did it for, but it Œ how Œ I don™t know how 
people get some enjoyment out of that. 
Anyway , that was my  feeling. An d one 
day the Americans cam
e over and bombed 
the Œ when we were outside, I was telli
ng you before, living outside on th e rocks 
were Œ after that bombing, why, we were 
asked, will you come 
down and guide us? 
They said, if you were soldiers, you ha
ve the discipline to 
help us with the 
wounded. And they had a guy in there, 
I don™t know h Œ the Œ he spoke a British 

accent, like he was Œ be-been trained in 
England
 or something, and he would talk 
to us, you know, he was the guy that they
 used for communication to us. And th en 
the Œ they  had another guy in th ere 
named Œ he was a Dutchman from du Œ 
Holland
, he spoke good Englis
h and he spoke German
 also. So they ™d 
communicate through him, and he gave us 
lots of information.
 But anyway, they 
come down and got us, they 
says, you will help us with
 the wounded 
people in the 
bombing. Took us up th ere, and I didn™t 
help anybody, cause I had no shoes, I was 

running through this fire and nails and stu
ff out there, and wood and stuff, and I was

going as slow as I could. And I saw a wooden
 Œ wooden shoe laying over there, and 
so I kneeled down and put 
that wooden shoe on my left foot, and the German 
guards over there picked up 
some board  and started beating me across the back, and 
you know, knocked the 
wind out of me. It seemed like 
I climbed Œ I crawled about a 
mile, probably about 20 feet, but it seemed
 like a mile, and ju st got Œ almo st 
knocked me out, cause I couldn™t hardly

act like I was help Œ trying to  help so me, 
put out the fire, some thing lik
e that. I just went around, but I didn™t do a darn  thing, 
but no one bothered me after that. Finally, I 
went back  to my  building I was in, but I 
sure didn™t help anybody. 
Some of the guys, I guess, had to help  somebody, you 
know, I didn™t. But anyway , wh en the Luft
waffe guy came through to look Œ he™s Œ 

I guess he was going to  say, look at the 
bomb damage, he told the Œ the other 
SS
 
guys that. And he came 
in. Well, we had a guy, 
Ben Sharf
(ph)
 
from 
New Prague
, 
Minneso ta
, he was our waist gunner. He spoke German from his ancestor was 
German. And so  we said, 
Ben
, you gotta go up, talk to 
th e guy. Tell him we should 
be in a 
POW
 camp. So 
Jim Fore
(ph) and I went up with  him, close to him, and he s 
Œ we told him salute the guy, so he™s Œ 
Ben 
saluted him, and this German off Œ 
Luftwaffe officer, he kind of gives a real, sl
ow salute. He didn™t 
know what to do, I 
think, cause real slow he kind of went

they talked a few mi

SS
 tried to break it up, and he pulled his 
rank on th em and told them to
 stand back, and so he talk
ed about five minutes to 
Ben
, and he told 
Ben
 that they didn™t 
work  very good with  the Gestapo and th e

, 
but he™d do what he could,
 but we shou

thought, well, that™s encour

ft. And it was, I don™t know, 
a month later, when I hear 
about a contingent of abou
t 150 Luftwaffe people came 
into camp, round us up, took us
 and put into only 
about 30 - 40 in a boxcar and took 
us to 
Stalag

 over Œ over Œ over on the Po lish border. So , man, and we got 
food, we got shoes, we got clothes. It was Œ it was like being in th e

just found out recently that
 there™s a book called, ﬁ

about a 
B-17

3,000 feet or so, and they™d  been throwing the radios 
out and the Œ the parachutes

Now, this German fighter pilot was a Cat
holic guy, and he had even  some other 
fighter pilots with him, had gone to 
Go erin g
 and tried to resign 
and knock off some 
of the stuff they was doing, 
but they almo st got shot over 
it. And this book is called, 
ﬁ
A Higher Call
,ﬂ and it™s just recently come out. 
It™s in English. I got a copy of it 
just this Œ this last month. 
It™s quite intriguing to read, 
but this guy is the same guy 
that came into our camp , that got us out of
 th ere, and he got us out of there three 
days befo re the record Œ the record  showing 
Buchen wald
 whatever, that we Œ we 
were supposed to be eliminat
ed three days Œ and he got us
 out three days before we 
were supposed to all been kille
d. The orders had come down from 
Berlin
. And this 
was just recently because this guy, 
Mike Dorsey
, his father Œ his grandfather was in 
Buchen wald
 with us, his name was 
Easy
(ph)
 Freeman
(ph). And his grandfather 
started talking about it in re
cent years, I guess, and so 
Mike Dorsey
 was a movie 
producer, he decided to  look in to
 it, and he went back to 
Germany
 for almost a 
year research, and then went
 to all the archives in 
Buchenwald 
and everything. And 
he made this movie called, ﬁ
The Lost Airman of Buchenwald
,ﬂ cause we had 
been lost because they didn™t know where we were. We weren™t in a 
POW
 camp 
until after the war they found where we we
re. So, that™s the reason that movie is 
named that, but I™m glad that he Œ his gr
andfather finally started talking about it, 
and he made this movie, and 
Œ and he Œ he ev en got Œ I 
was surprised, but when he 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

went back  to 
Buchenwa ld
, looked at all the records, he
 brought me back my arrest 
record, my Gestapo arrest pictur
e, and the record of it. Shows 
USA
, and then has it 
crossed out, and I think it says 
[indecipherable]
 or something up there on it. 
Q: When you were at 
Buchen wald
, how did Œ did you ind 
Œ did you stay with Œ 
physically stay with most other allied airman? 
A: Oh yes, always.  

Q: And how did you co nduct yourselves wh
en you were in camp? Did you maintain 
military discipline, did you 
maintain rank and order? 
A: Yes, we Œ we all decided the highest 
ranking officer would 
be in charge. And 
that happened to be a New Zealander, the 
only New Zealander there, but he was a Œ 
a squadron leader, and so we
 all agreed our Œ our hi
ghest ranking officer of 
Americans agreed, we all agreed we would 
do whatever he said, and we™d act as a 
military unit. And a lot of tim
es even we go to the latr
ine, that open latrine down 
there, we™d form up and march like we were soldiers. The 
SS
 guys just Œ we threw 
them in fits almost when 
we do that, because we we
re acting military, you know, 
like a unified unit. They didn™t like that. So
, yeah, we tried to act as military as 

possible. We™d sing songs you know, and stu
ff like that, and just to Œ I don™t know, 
I guess to keep our spirits up. May have 
tormented them too,
 but I think it was 
primarily for our own si Œ you know, our 
own spirits. And we all Œ I don™t know, 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen  
 
April 26, 2013
 
 
 
 
49
and we also when  we were there, we all agr
eed that if we ever got out of there, we 
would Œ we formed a club called the 
KLB
 pre-lager 
Buchenwald
. And we would 
all meet every year somewhere, and all of
 us would attend these meetings. We did 
for many years. We met in 
England
, we met in the 
United States
, we met all over 
the places. But all of us guys would ge
t together and it was Œ it was just a 
camaraderie that you develop, you know
, by being in th ese situations. So Œ 
Q: When you were at 
Buchen wald
, did you actually pers
onally witness any allied 
servicemen murdered
 or killed by the Œ 
A: No, no. I only saw guys get s Œ knocked
 around a little bit. A couple of guys got 
pneumonia and died, you know. That was 
L
.
C
.
 Beck
(ph). He was from 
[indecipherable]
 
Park
, 
California
. And 
Jim Fore
(ph) and I, after we got back in 
service, went to see his parents and tell th
em, cause they never had any ar Œ he Œ he 
ri Œ had written some notes when he wa
s with the French 
underground, and it™s 
called, I think ﬁ
Fighter
 
Pilot
.ﬂ And he wrote this little 
book. And his parents we Œ 
all this information was given to his pa
rents, and they  p-printed th is little book. 
Anyway , we went to see his parents and tell them how his last days were in 

Buchen wald
, and he died of pneumonia. So, 
other than  that I saw no actual Œ I 
didn™t see everything, but I Œ I just saw 
no one get ki-killed by the Germans. So Œ

Q: Do you have any idea 
why th ey  sent you to  
Buchenwa ld
, as opposed to a 
POW
 
camp? 
A: Yes, I think because we 
had been caught in civilian 
clothes, with the French 
underground, and we Œ even though they
 knew  who we were
, cause they even 
showed us some pictures of our squad, an
d showed  our Œ they had the names of our 
squad and they had a lo t of info rmati
on on us. And we had 
dog tags, you know. 
They  knew who we were, but
 the excuse was, we were
 caught with Œ we were 
saboteurs and terrorists cause were were ca
ught in civilian clothes with the French 
underground, so we were sent to 
Buchenwald
. That™s the way I assume it 
happened . I have no other Œ no other 
reason, you know, th
at I can think of. 
Q: You got on the train at 
Buchen wald
, and head towards 
Stalag Lu ft III
.
 
I 
assume you did not know 
where you were going. 
A: No. 

Q: What happens wh en you got there? 
A: Kind of shock. We were herded  out of
 the train, you know. He
rded in there like I 
told you, and pretty soon we 
were herded in there, and 
took our clothes off, put us 
in the shower and shaved our heads and 
bodies and swabbed us 
and gave us some 
prison clothes, and that was it. We were ju
st in total shock, really, you know, we 
didn™t know wh at was going on. The othe
r prisoners, some of the prisoners, and

51
through, like I say, 
Ben Sharf
(ph), and Œ an d 
Dutch
, we found out that the other 
prisoners say the only way you™ll ever leav
e this place is up th e pipe, and that was 
the cremato rium chimney there, you know. 
So we were constantly told that, you 
know, the only way out is up the pipe. So 
we™d all kind of resigned ourselves to 
that, more or less, you know
, and hoping we™d get out 
and hoping the allies would, 
you know, get us before 
the Œ we got up th e pipe. 
Q: Right. 

A: So it was just Œ I don™t know. I don™t 
know how we even kept our spirits up, but 
we Œ we were doing ra Œ pretty good. We™d 
talk a lot and we™d la
ugh Œ sit in Œ this 
forming of the 
KLB
 club was part of Œ we™d  have 
discussions wh ere we were going 
to meet, how we were going to  do it, how
 the organization was going to  be and 
everything. So it was Œ we Œ it was all planned in 
Buchenwa ld
. And we had a little 
badge, we drew up a sig Œ insignia that we
 all had, and so it was a Œ it was just Œ I 
think it was to keep us busy,
 but also the camaraderie, yo
u know, that we™d have if 
we ever got out of th ere. So Œ and I-I don™
t know how, some of
 the guys who got on 
the march, like I said, so
me of the guys that we Œ wh en we marched from 
Stalag 
Luft III
, we got there on th at march, some of
 the guys just gave up. We saw one 
guy, and he went running, cli Œ tried to 
climb the electric fence, you know, some 
guys gave up. I have a Œ a 
strange attitude of life. I always believed in a higher

52
power like the lord 
Jesus Christ
 as a savior, and I, as a kid I went to mi Œ I™ve got 
records showing I went to Sunday school
, never missing a Œ a Sunday for four 
years, five years, you know. And Œ and wh
en I was put up in front of the firing 
squad, all I Œ my  cares all we
nt away, I just flat lined, and I, from that day forward, 
I don™t get excited, I don™t get upset, I 
don™t get mad, I don™t wo rry. And wh en I 
used to work in th
e engineering stuff, why we™d be
 on government proposals. We 
had three guys in my  depart
ment die of heart attacks in one year, and th ey issued 
stress cards that you hold and they  turn
 color if you start getting stressed, and the 
director™d hold a meeting, 
and pretty soon you seen hi
m take his little card out of 
his pocket, lay it down on the table, and I 
knew he was getting stressed. And after 
the meeting, guys used to come up to me
, cause they™d be ho
llering, deadlines and 
why don™t you do th is, why don
™t you do th at. And they™d  come up to me and say, 
let™s see your card. Show th em mine, it wa
s normal. They™d say, wh at the hell is 
wrong with you, don™t 
you have any nerves? I said yeah
. I says, if this
 is a problem, 
fix it. If you can™t fix it, what™s the problem?  
Q: Right. 

A: Kind of strange attitude, but I just Œ I 
just got that, like I say, after that firing 
squad, I just can™t bring myself to worry. I don
™t Œ I™d Œ hate is a terrible thing too. I 
see people hate, and I see what
 hate does, like the Germans hated the Jewish people,

53
and the other people, and I Œ I just Œ I Œ I 
don™t even hate the Germans, I feel so rry 
for them. Cause even the 
SS
 guys, you know, I don™t ag
ree with it, I don™t like it 
and everything, but I can™t Œ I just can™t br
ing myself to hate. 
I-I™m a strange duck, I 
guess, but I Œ I can™t. 

Q: How long were you in 
Stalag Lu ft III
? 
A: Let™s see, I think we were only there maybe three months or so. 

Q: Did you gain any weight ba
ck, were you sick, were you Œ 
A: Oh I Œ yeah, I gained some weight ba
ck, I Œ I don™t know how much I weighed, 
but I gain ed some, and I had my  Œ I had a 
wound in my lower le
g when  I bailed out, 
I don™t know if it was from 
shrapnel, hooked on some 
[indecipherable]
 torn metal 
or wh at, but I had a pretty good gash just
 about to the bone, right about halfway up 
my  lower leg, and when I hit the ground, 
why I turned  my  ankle, I guess it was kind 
of sore or something, hurt 
[indecipherable]
. And when I was in 
Buchenwald
 it 
turned into gangrene
, like. It was all numb and just Œ couldn™t have any feeling, it 
felt like just you Œ you know
 how your leg Œ how someth
ing goes to sleep when 

you™re 
[indecipherable]
 that™s the way it felt. I coul
d hardly feel I was walking on 
it, you know, it was just kind of
 bad. So when  I got to 
Stalag Luft III
, why, they Œ 
they tried to put sulfur drugs and stuff on 
it and nothing would touch it, so then they 
put me in the prison hospital. And the Ge
rman doctor there wanted to amputate my 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen  
 
April 26, 2013
 
 
 
 
54
leg right above the kn
ee. And I Œ Captain 
Daniels
, he was Œ we had Major jone Œ 
Davy Jones
, and Captain
 Daniels
, who were on the 
Doolittle
 raids in 
To kyo  
unit. 
And they  ended up in 
Euro pe
 and being shot down, and they were in our Œ south 
comp ound of the da Œ 
Stalag Luft III
.  Anyway, Captain 
Daniels
 there in the 
hospital and I said, no, no, no,
 I Œ you know, listen, I don™
t want my  leg cut off. And 
so they talked to the German guy, Captain 
Da niels
, and they decided, well, the only 
solution was to try to save would be to Œ 
they made kind of a tray, a curved tray 
they laid down on my  leg, and th ey  wrap
ped my  leg with gauze about Œ looked like 
about two inches thick, and th
ey hung it up at about a 20 
- 30 degree angle, and they 
put a Œ a Œ a metal bucket up th ere, hung it up there with a nail hole in it, dripping 
saltwater on it. And they dripped it on my to
e, and it just run down the thing. I don™t 
know if it was a month or something, it dri
pped Œ just dripped every day, it was just 
Œ it was mi serable, just laying there, but
 you know Œ anyway it was a long time, I 
don™t know how long it was, but that thing 
got Œ the whole thing got just like a big 

rock cast, cause all that salt and then it™
d evaporate, you know
. And they come in 
one day and they said, well, we™re gonna cut 
it off, see what we got.
 So they cut that 
Œ all that gauze and stuff off of there, a
nd it was just a Œ if you™ve ever seen a 
parched earth, it™s just cracks and stuff 
and brown, and rotten looking th ing. And 
then they squeezed it w
ith this gauze and stuff, and the 
pus is squirt out around my 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

55
ankle, and it volcanoes up around my  knee an
d stuff like that, and they™d squeeze it 
and milk it a little bit. And it stunk like crazy. 
So he looked at it, 
and they sh  Œ they 
kind of shook th eir heads, and th ey sa
id, well, it™s doing so
mething, so they 
wrapped it up ag ain, put the saltwater up there again and kept dripping it on there, 
and I don™t know, seemed like a month, I don
™t know how long it was, really. And it 
got all hard again, they took it off, and it was starting to grow 
skin back. 
So they 
kept wrap  Œ wrapping in gauze, and stuff 
like that, and they we Œ and they finally 
sent me back to the Œ my  barracks back 
at the saw Œ compound, and I was there and 
I was Œ it was hard to walk on, but it wa
s Œ I was limping around, and it was getting 
a little better all the time. And they would 
Œ I Œ I forget how often the Œ but they 
would rewrap it. I don™t reme mb er, my  mi
nd is gone, I guess, on how often, but 

every once in a while 
they™d  Œ ev ery couple of days, why they™d rewrap the leg, and 
I™d walk on it. It hurt, but I walked on it,
 and then I was in Œ I was Œ guess I was in 
the theater one night there when  all of 
a sudden they  come in and said, we™re Œ 
we™re gonna leave the camp. Cause we™d s
een all the low flying airplanes and stuff 
going, you know, to-towards th
e Russian front over there, and we™d heard a lot of 
rumors about it in camps, what
™s going on. And so Co lonel 
Clark
, he was a colonel 
major Œ he was General 
Clark
 at 
Colo rado Springs
 there, the air Œ air academy 
there later on, but he was 
a colonel in our camp  there at south co mp ound. Majo r

Davy Jones 
and Captain
 Da niels
 and Colonel 
Clark
. Anyway, Colonel 
Clark
 
asked me, he says, that we™re gonna go on this march 
[indeciphera ble]
 we™re 
gonna leave. There™s about three foot
 of snow on the ground, and Co lonel 
Cl
 Œ 
Colonel 
Clark
 asked me, he says, you want to stay
 here, and be liber
 Œ or be Œ we Œ 
get liberated by the Russians? Or do y
ou want to go with the masses, it™s your 
choice. So I says, I™ll go with the masses
 of people, and maybe the cold and the 
walking, the circulation will help. He says
, you th ink you can make it? I says, well, 
I™m gonna try. So I went on the march,
 I was limping and it hurt, but every day 
seemed to be a little b it better, cause I thi
nk the circulation and 
the cold Œ it wasn™t 
gonna re-infect, I don™t think, with the co
ld, you know. And I think th e circulation 
was helped by ju st walking on
 it, just constantly walking, cause we walked a long 
time. And finally got better. I was s
till limping when I got home, but Œ 
Q: How many days 
did you march? 
A: It seemed like a month, but I Œ I do
n™t rememb er how many days we Œ and I 
know the first time we marched, what Œ 
60 Œ I think we marc
hed about 65 miles or 
something, I had heard, I 
don™t know how miles it was, 
but it was Œ seemed like a 
couple days. We stopped at, I think a brick 
factory, or something like that. Once Œ I 
stopped at a barn once with hay, and th at
 were Œ was pretty nice. And two or three 
times on that trip we stopped at places th
at we got warm, and they  gave us some

57
soup. And I don™t really rememb er how ma
ny days it was. I™m sure other people 
know wh at Œ how many days that was on th e trip, but Œ 

Q: Did you understand why 
you were being marched? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 evacuate from the Russian front, cause the Russians were 
coming, they  were close by apparently, an
d they wanted  to get us away from the 

Russians. 

Q: Why? 
A: Well, you don™t want the Russians to get a
hold of us, they wanted  to just keep us 
as prisoners, cause we were material that
 they could trade, or hold hostage, or 
something like that, you know. We just a
ssumed that we were hostages to be held, 

and the more of us that they could keep
, the Œ the better. And getting us away from 
the fronts, you know, and 
we ended up down at 
Moosburg
, which was pretty 
crowded, had lots of prisoners there, 
you know. And then  we heard rumo rs about 
the allies n o t too far away, and they Œ th
ey had radio there too, you know, their 
secret radios, they had crysta
l sets. And I heard Œ we were 
told that Œ that if they 
tried to evacuate us from 
Moosburg
 to be Œ light a building 
on fire or something, 
cause they™d have planes circling. And we
 noticed that at ab
out 35,000 feet or 
something, way up in  the sky,
 we™d hear these airplanes, and once in  a great wh ile 
you could see one of them, but they™re Œ 
just barely see them. And they were Œ 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

58
circled day and night, and th ey said, light
 a building on fire, something, if anything 
Œ they started to kill anybo
dy or anything like that, 
and they would make an 
immediate attack on the camp. And we we
re shocked one day 
was Œ I was down by 
the gate cause there was a lot of co
mmo tion and stuff and the Germans were 
coming by, and there are tanks rolling by a
nd everything else, and I think Captain 
he Œ and Captain 
Da niels
 was down th ere close to me too, and th e German guards 
all of a sudden were running to  a Œ one the 
buildings, their Œ their little guard shack 
there. And Œ and then  we saw what was happening, the 
SS
 guy there, there was tank 
people out there, were telling the Œ motioni
ng them to come out
 and help fight, I 
guess, cause we were right down th ere by th e gate watching th em, and all of a 
sudden one of these Germans put a 
Panzer 
fist, a German anti-tank gun right into 
those Œ his own guys, those Luftwaffe guys at 
the Œ at the gate in the build ing there, 
just blew it wide open . Holy  mackerel, 
you know, wh at™s going on, cause all hell 
was breaking loose, you know. You hear gu
nfire and cannon fire and everything 
else, and the Americans were shelling pre
tty high with large 
cannons, because you 
could look up to  
Moosburg
 and see the tar sliding off the roofs of the houses and 
stuff. So, was pretty noisy for a while, a
nd all of a sudden the American tanks 
started coming by and we sa
w the goings on, and Œ and 
it wasn™t five minutes 
behind th e front lines, here come 
Patton

. It™s ju Œ standing up in

his 
Jeep
, and he mo tioned they  Œ he mo tioned 
a tank or something, break down the 
fence, he come driving right in
side the camp and stood up in his 
Jeep
, and told  
everybody, you know, to be quie
t or something. He gave a 
little talk and 
told us not 
to go into town, and stuff 
like that. And I was shocked to
 see him there, I was Œ you 
know, just dumbfounded. Here he had hi
s pearl handled revolvers on, that you 
know, like, what was it Œ wh at™s her name
, some, you know, singer had given him, 
you know. And I-I was s
hocked, cause he wasn™t five
 minutes for find the Œ behind 
the front lines. So we just st
ayed in camp and th
en they  let us out, and I went up to 
where the Americans had put 
a pontoon bridge across the 
river up th ere, right in 
town , in the south side of town . And I went
 up there one time, and the Œ the Œ I was 
amazed that the engineers were out there pu
tting a bridge back across the river; it 
had been cu t loose. They were trying to
 get tanks across the river, and the Germans 
were up higher, shelling that down there to
 the river, and they cut the bri Œ their 
pontoon bridge loose one time, and it floate
d kind of down th e river, and they  had 

these little boats out there, outboard 
[indecipherable]
 towing that thing back up and 
con Œ reconnected. And shells were, you 
know, dropping in the water down in Œ 
above them there. I was shocked, I Œ no
w I realized, you know, I™d be running and 
hiding, rather than being there, but you 
could see it, the splash of the water and 
stuff, from where we were. An
d I remember seeing that Œ 
that German flag come

off that steeple up there in 
Moo sburg
, and the American flag go up. What a Œ what 
a feeling. You can™t explain it. It™s just Œ 
Q: How long did it take be
fore they ev
acuated you? 
A: It was a few days, because I know they
 brought in the Œ th
e Œ the Œ you know, 
there™s tanks, there are armored cars and st
uff, and I got r Œ and 
they brought in a 
soup kitchen from their military guys at th
e front lines, and th ey had some Œ some 
soup, bean soup w
ith corned beef in it. 
And I got a couple of bowls of that, and I ate 
it. Should never have done 
it, because I got so sick, I Œ I Œ I-I was wishing so meone 
would sh oot me in the head, cause I never be
en so sick in my life. I laid there in 
bed, in th at bunk for I don™t know how 
long. But I don™t k
now how long Œ how 
many days I was there, but I Œ I-I Œ I™ve neve
r been so sick in my life. That Œ but 
that corn Œ I call it corn 
willie soup, it was so good. 
Q: Was this a question of 
too rich for your system? 
A: Oh yeah, cause we had 
been, you know Œ bad re Œ 
not very mu ch rations and 
stuff like that, and yeah , it was just too rich. And imme diately when  the Œ and 

finally the medics came in and cut us off 
all that stuff, you know

A: 
San Francisco
. 
Q: And who was the first family memb er you saw? 
A: It was Œ I Œ I hitched Œ I hitchhiked, co
uldn™t get Œ didn™t kn
ow how to get home, 
so I started hitchhiking, and guy who was going to  
Monterey Park
 in a little co upe 
out there, it was a 
Plymouth
 coupe or something pick ed me up, and finally picked 
up another guy, it was two of us r
ode with him. And he drove to 
Huntington 
par Œ 
to 
Monterey Park
, 
California
. It was down very close 
to home, a few miles away. 
And wh en I got there I Œ luckily I rememb
ered my  parents™ phone numb er. So I 
called the house, and my  brother happened  to
 be there. My brother had been in  the 
military, but he had had a heart murmur, and so he got ou
t, and he happened to be 
there. So I talked to him,
 and he drove up th  Œ to 
Monterey Park
 and picked  me 
and this other guy up. So Œ an
d he took me home, you know. 
Q: Did you go straight 
home to your parents? 
A: Yeah, I went straight home to my parents™ house. 
Q: What was it like seeing them? 
A: Can™t explain it. Just 
being home, you know, it™s a gr
eat thing. And seeing the 
family, and then the Œ I stayed
 in the Œ I wasn™t Œ I wasn™t discharged yet, but I was 
able to stay home, 
and I worked with 
GCA 
Œ
 Ground Approach Sy stems
, cause 
Gilfillan
 was building radars and stuff for gr
ound approaches, training, and I was 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen  
 
April 26, 2013

still in the military
, so I went to 
Mines Field
 which is 
LA 
International Airport, but 
the military  side of it, and I Œ we™d go ther e every day and worked to put radios in 
planes and tune them up and stuff like that , cause the pilots were practicing landing 
with that new radar 
Gilfillan
 built. So I worked there fo
r, I don™t know, a couple of 
months. At first I was assigne
d Œ I ga Œ got to go home, a
nd th en I was at Œ at Œ got 
to what was it, 
Santa Monica
, at a hotel out there, and th
en Œ but I wasn™t required 
to stay there, I had a home tel Œ hotel room, but they  said I could live at home if I 

wanted to, so I just lived at
 home with my  parents. And 
I™d drive out to ma-march Œ 
Mines Field 
every day at 
LA International Airport
, and so I don™t know how long 
I worked there until I got out of
 the service, and sent to 
San Bernardino
, and I was 
discharged from there. But in
 the meantime I™d read in 
th e paper and the magazines 
about television and some stuff, and Dr. se Œ de Œ 
Lee De Forest
, who invented the 
vacuum tube and 
Sa nabria
, his cohort had formed an engineering, electrical 
engineering and 
TV
 school in Œ on Œ in 
Hollywood
. And so I got ahold of them and 
wanted to  know if I could go to  school
 there and get a degree in electrical 
engineering and learn 
TV
 and stuff like that, and so I si
gned up for it. So I went to s 
Œ I was in school three days 
after I got discharg ed out of 
San Bernardino
. So I 
went right to school, and got out of there 
Œ went there f Œ abou
t three years and got 
out, and the first thi
ng I did was Œ cause 
TV
 was just coming on the market, I went 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

in the 
TV
 business. I went to work 
for a guy that was Œ bought a 
TV
, and then  went 
in it myself. And 
RCA
 was advertising they were g
onna make a Œ a projection tube, 
five inch projection tube. And they
™d had a little 10 inch table model 
TV
. And 
Bausch 
and 
Lo mb
 was talking about a lens for this 
RCA
 thing. So I was 
inquisitive, I called them up and asked 
RCA
 if I could get is Œ one of those tubes, 
and called 
Bausch
 and 
Lo mb
, see if I could get a lens, and I did it, and I took a 10 
inch 
RCA
 
TV
 and converted it to Œ made a little pr
ojection set. I put a 12 by 16 foot 
projection set in the 
Shrine 
Auditorium in 1947 for the 
Rose Bowl
 game and the 
Rose Parade
. I sold 200 and Œ I sold 2400 s Œ I think Œ no, s Œ fe Œ was it Œ about a 
thousand seats anyway, at two dollars
 and 40 cents apiece for the whole 
Ro se Bo wl
 
game and the 
Ro se P ara de
. I Œ I Œ I was sweating that, because I had two of these 
little 
TV
 projector things made up, and with  a 
RCA
 chassis because if one failed, I 
thought I™d re Œ I™d get shot if 
something happened. Bu t I went to 
Bodie
(ph) plastic 
screens, I could contact a guy in  
Hollywo od 
that Œ cause I knew they made Œ you 
know, they had their experimental 
TVs 
and ther Œ
 
not 
TVs
, but projections up there. 
They already project them from th
e rear. So I got ahold of this 
Bodie
(ph) plastic 
screen guy out in Œ in 
Venice
, ma de the screens, and asked him if he can make me a 
screen. So I had a 12 by 16 foot, they 
made a wooden frame and put this plastic on 
it, and they s Œ they™d pu
t the projector back there and ha-h ave a hot spot, and

they™d  spray with a Œ like a spray gun with
 plastic, and it would 
make it thicker in 
the center, so it made it even, 
the light even . Wouldn™t have a hot spot in th e center. 
So I parj Œ project it from the rear, a
nd had a good time. I didn™t have any 
complaints at all, and all thes
e people over there got to see the 
Rose Bowl
 game. I 
made money and Œ 
Q: How long did it take after the war before
 di Œ di Œ before 
you spoke ab out your 
experiences at 
Buchenwald
? 
A: I si Œ told my parents a little bit about
 it. And then  there™s a family down about 
four or five houses from my  parents th
at was German ancestry and I Œ but the 
neighbors would ask me about stuff like that
, I™d tell them a little bit about it. And 
that family, the German family says
 oh, that™s all a lie. T h ere™s no Œ no 
concen tration camps in 
Germany
 and stuff like that. They didn™t believe any of it. 
And other people™d say Œ you say something 
about it, a-are you su re that™s true, you 
know. Did that really happen? 
And th ey just question it, so we just Œ mo st Œ all of 
us, you talk to them, we sort of stopped talk
ing about it. And I was Œ but I to Œ I just 
tell people Œ a lot of people about it, and a 
lot of people kind 
of yeah, yeah, yeah, 
something like that. But I never talked ab
out it much, but about f Œ I don™t know, 10 
or 15 years ago, I don™t know how lo
ng it was, but I used to go to the 
VA
 hospital in 
Long Beach
. And I went there one day, I Œ cause every month I™d Œ I™d go in  once a

66
month and they™d  check my  blood pressure 
and give me a Œ a Œ if I need vitami ns, 
or wh atever I needed, you know? And I we
nt in there one day and I heard Œ th ey  

paged me to report to a certain office, a
nd I did. I went in there and the guy sat 
down  and he says, I™m the psychiatrist here
 at the hospital, and he said, I want to 
talk to you. So I sat Œ sat down. He sa
ys, you™re saying you™re
 Œ right up here you 
were in 
Buchenwald
 concen tration camp, and he says
, you™re a liar. Just plain out, 
you™re a liar. You Œ you were in a 
POW
 camp. I says, doctor, I know the difference. 
You don™t. I just got up and walked out. Bu
t, you know, you get things like that, and 
so you kind of Œ you kind of 
Œ why talk about it? And th
e only time we really talk 
about it was when our group 
got togeth er, you know, we™d
 talk about our stories, 
you know, and stuff like that. 
And it hasn™t been just til Œ 
til recent years, and then Œ 
I don™t even  know how 
it happened, but the 
Santa Ana 
ﬁ
Register
ﬂ heard about I 
guess this deal through s-someone, I don™t 
know how they  heard ab out it even. And 
they called me up one time, wanted to come 
and talk to me. So they sent a reporter 
out to talk to me and then 
they put a whole thing in the 
Santa Ana 
ﬁ
Register
ﬂ 
about me and 
Buch enwald
 concentration camp  and so fo rth. And pe Œ I started 
getting calls, and then got a call from the 
Kiwanis
 Club down in 
Newpo rt Bea ch
, 
and they wanted me to come and talk to 
them about the experi
ence. Got a call from 
the Jewish war veterans. And 
you started getting all these 
calls that people want to

know about it, you know, it™s Œ it™s happene
d in recent years, you know. And it™s 
just Œ it™s strange. And then these m
ovies would come out, you know, like 
Mike 
Dorsey™s
 film, and stuff like that. And it™s ju
st, I don™t know, the last couple of 
years or so it™s just kind of come alive again. 
Q: Did you receive any compensa
tion from the German government? 
A: I Œ I got s Œ I don™t know if 
it™s from the German government, the 
IMF
, the 
International Monetary Fund, and I got, I don™t know, se
ems to me lik
e it was three 
or 4,000 dollars, something 
like that, quite a number of years ago. But I ran across 
some of that paperwork recently, I was 
going through a bunch of
 stuff, and I don™t 
remember exactly how 
much it was, but it was something like that, three or 4,000 
dollars, I was surprised.
 But it came from th e 
IMF
. I was surprised that Œ how they 
did that whole thing. I thought, why did 
it come the International Monetary Fund? 
And I don™t know if it was directly from 
Germany
, or if it was negotiations. I Œ I 
knew nothing about how th
at all come about. 
Q: Were you deco rated? 
A: No. I got a Purple Heart, and I think 
a air medal, few  things like that, but no, 
nothing else. 
Q: This interview is going to
 be Œ beco me part of the 
United States
 
Holoca ust 
Memorial Museum™s 
permanent collection. It™s going 
to be used by historians and

68
scholars of the Holo caust for many, many 
years to come . Is there anything you™d 
like to say in closing? 
A: The only thing I™d like to say is, I™ve been very in
terested in the school system 
for a long time, cause I have had a couple of
 kids go through it. My wife and I were 
both involved heavil
y in the Œ going to school board
 meetings and stuff, and I was 
astonished at all Œ how little history and re
al information is be
ing given and the Œ 
the Œ I don™t think the teachi
ng professions care much abou
t this type of thing. And 
I™ve always felt, and I™ve heard many year
s that those who fo rget history are 
deemed to relive it. And it scares me th
at the young people today know very little 
about that stuff. And it™s Œ it™s maybe it™s Œ 
a lot of it™s kind of nasty, but I-I just 
think that Œ that the school systems and the 
colleges even are Œ I™ve talked to a lot of 
college professors and stuff. Like, my ol
der son used to come home and tell me 
what the college professors are say ing. An
d it just disturbed me that they are not 
mo re knowledgeable. They  should be, I thin
k. And I just Œ that™s part Œ it just 
bothers me that they™re not educating th e ki
ds to really Œ what really went on in 
history, cause they don™t even teach, I do
n™t think, good old-time hist ory, how this 

country was founded, you kn
ow. Our freedoms that we 
have. If you go to Œ if 
you™ve traveled mu ch, and a lot of people haven™t Œ I have, quite a bit in other 

countries, and see how they operate and 
what™s going on, and this is still the 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

69
greatest country  there is, and the freedoms we
 have. Bu t they seem to be grad ually 
taken away from us, and th e Œ things no
w are happening today that disturb me 
greatly, because it™s just th
at little encroachment
 upon these little lib erties and little 
things, they™re just going aw ay, and th  Œ thou
gh that™s not right, 
you know, this, that 
and the other thing. But this country didn
™t grow, it didn™t grow financially Œ it™s 
been the most successful coun
try in the world. And why pe
ople can™t see that Œ to 
me it™s obvious. And why do people from al
l over the world want to come to the 
United States
? And that bothers me a great deal
, that we don™t Œ I don™t know, it 
just Œ I™m just disturbed by the way our count
ry seems to  be going, and that fact that 
young people don™t really know anything ab ou
t history. That part bothers me. My 
grandkids, I™m glad to say that I Œ I was able
 last year in April to Œ when I went to 

Buchen wald
, and Œ by invitation of the Germans;
 my wife and I; my younger son 
and my  grandkids; we took them, we went
 there, they were Œ spent a week at 
Buchen wald
 area, hearing all the speeches and seeing the graves and seeing all the 
history that took place there. And they were
 Œ my dau Œ grandda
ughter is fif Œ just 
turned 15, she™s old enough 
to understand, she asked a lo
t of questions, so she was 
inquisitive. I just think more
 kids need to know about wh
at really went on. I know 
that some of it is nasty and bad, but th
at™s life. And protecting them and saying 
everything™s just hunky dory and sm-smile
y roses all th e time is not the way real 

 
Interv iew with Cha sten Bo wen

life is. So that part bothers me, I just Œ I-I 
just have strong feelings about our school 
system and things like that, I Œ I™m bothered en ough 
[indecipherable]
. But it does, 
it bothers me a great deal that ev
en grown-up people don™t know. And 
[indecipherable]
 today, a lot of people still deny 
the Holocaust ha
ppened. How can 
they deny it with so much 
eviden ce and Œ an d everything? And yet people, th-they 
seem to have their head in
 the sand, to me. And maybe 
I™m just an old Œ ignorant 
old man, but I-I feel that people need to o-open their eyes and look around, cause 
we sure don™t want to relive it. A n yway, th
at™s my feelings, I just Œ you™re stuck 
with them. 
Q: We thank you Mr. 
Bowen
. Very much appreciate it. 
A: Oh, my pleasure. I just am glad that it Œ 
I™m glad that you™re doing this, to let the 
future know what
