Question: 
Thisis January 22
nd
, and we™re at the home of 
Helga G ross
 for an 
interview for the Holocaust Museum. Would you tell us about where you grew up, 
what your family was l ike; your parents, your siblings, your background? 

Answer: I grew up at my parents™ home. I was a very happy chil d, until 
Hitler 

changed everyt hing, and he changed my life. It was very rough. 

Q: Did you know about  
Hitler
 and his policies? When did you become aware of 

Hitler
 and his Œ and his policies? 

A: He was president of Œ in 
Germany
, 
Interbruck
(ph). Oh, at the 
Hindenburg
. 
When  
Hindenburg
, when he died, 
Hitler 
took over. We were all shocked that t hat 
happened. Before, we didn™t know. My grandmother was crying, my mother and 

father, what™s going on? We had no idea. 

Q: How old were Œ how old were you at t he time? 

A: I think i t was 1933 when he took over, so I was 13 years old. I remember it well, 

when I saw m y parents and m y grandmother, they were all crying. I didn™t 

understand yet, I was st ill too young, and I was deaf. So, interviews were very 
difficult.

Q: How did you communicate in your fami ly, because Œ well, first tell us Œ I Œ I™m 
sorry, first tell us about  your family, and were the y all deaf, or were your parents 

deaf, or Œ tell Œ give us a little bit more about what your family was l ike. 

A: My parents were hearing. My father was awkward. He really didn™t have good 

communication wit h Œ with deaf people. My mother, my mother was a singer, and 
she really taught me how to speak, and play the piano, and with i ntonation, using 
the piano, and I practiced a lot. And that™s one reason I s Œ I spoke well, the German 

language, that is. Every morning at  breakfast, we would sit with paper and pencil, 

and I woul d try and tal k to my parents, using a different language, and m y parents 

thought that I was using a wrong l anguage. They said, you must speak properly. If it 

was wrong, then we would write down on the paper, and Œ on the paper, the correct 

way. And t he y told me I must read a lot of books, and learn the language correct
ly.
 
Q: So Œ so, it was your mother who really was the communicator i n the family? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What about with your Œ  

A: The y never ignored Œ m y mother never ignored me or my brother. The two of us 

were deaf, and she always paid attention t o us. I have another brot her and sister as 

well, and the y™re hearing. And the y play music. I couldn™t  hear anyt hing, but we

were very happy as chi ldren. Always music in the house. Music™s in our blood, all 
of us. 

Q: T-T-Tell Œ 
go ahead.
 
A: When people would come to vi sit, or t o eat, there were Œ we were always 

playing, and they would ask us questions. They would say the alphabet. For five 
minutes we would have to write, or I woul d write, until I got everyt hi ng right. And 
if the names were wrong, I would be like a game, who could remember the names, 

and who could spel l them right. And I would win. I remember bei ng so happy. We 

would go out after dinner for a walk. My father taught me what™s the name of that 

tree, and see that bird? Here™s the name of this bird, and al wa ys trying to teach me, 

m y father was. All of the children, actually. He would use gestures, and he woul d 

move his mouth. 
Q: How did she understand what he was sa yi ng? Did she read lips, or Œ 
A: Yes, I read his li ps. My mother could see in my mind, but the German language, 

I hadn™t learned it, it was a hard process.
 
[phone ring ing ]
 
Q: Can you tell her to stop the telephone ri nging? 
[technical
,
 
brea k] 
Ask her again, 
because the phone Œ because the phone rang, i f she would tell us agai n about how 

she and her father com municated. 

A: Again? Start from what I said before, or what Œ 
whatdo you mean again?

Q: Yes, from what Œ from what Œ from what she said before about when she would 
walk with her father Œ 
[pho ne ri nging ] 
We have to unplug the phone.

 Oka y, so I-I™m trying t o understand if Œ if her family, did the y 
sign, or di d the y j ust read lips, or how did the y Œ how did the y comm unicate? 

A: We 
Œ lips Œ we read lips, and signed, t oo. My parents didn™t have anything 
against signing. The y t hought signing was beautiful. Signing as Œ hel ped to relax 

with deaf people. It™s hard to just Œ and stressful to just read lips, so t hey preferred 

us to be relaxed. Some other people™s parents were against signing, and the y really 

forced them to speech read, and the children got very frustrated, but I was very 

relaxed, and very happy, because my mot her and father had a lot of music in the 

house, and the y underst ood the arts, and there was a lot of love around us alwa ys. I 

was very lucky to have m y Œ the parents I had.  
Q: Tell us Œ tell us about your school, what Œ what kind of school you went to. 
A: It was a deaf school. Did you read about Œ deaf and dumb is what it  means. A 

long ti me ago, the y used to refer to deaf, as deaf and dumb. 
Deaf 
stumm
, in 

German. And I would be silent, I would j ust say deaf, not dumb. Now, it™s like 

handicapped. That™s much better than a long time ago, when the y sai d deaf and 

dumb. I would go back and forth, from home to school. It was about a 30 minute 

walk. I was very happy with m y classmates at school. We pla yed around, we talked.

Signing was not allowed in school , the teachers forced us to speech read. But when 
we were outside, we all signed together. 

Q: And how long did you go to this school? Was it Œ di d she start school in this 

school? Was this from Œ 

A: Until I was 14 years old, I went to that school
, ma ybeI went 
Œ m y mother took 
me to school, I thi nk first to a hard of hearing school, and t he y found out that my Œ I 

didn™t hear well enough. So then they put me in the school for the deaf. I was nine 

years old, eight or nine, at the ti me. Sta yed there until I was 14. Then I sta yed home 

with my parents. I was like a house -daught er, I cleaned, I cooked. They taught me 

how to Œ t o speak, and how to do a lot of things. 

Q: Was thi s Œ 

A: When I was Œ t wo year later, when I was 16, this house-daughter l earned to cook 
and sew and everything, so then I went to work. I went t o work as a weaver. I 
learned art, I went to school with hearing people, of course. It was really difficult 

for me. I was frustrated. I didn™t really underst and what the teacher was sa ying. My 

mother talked with the administrat ors about my problem i n being deaf. 

Bibliothèque. I went into the library, got books, and it sti ll didn™t satisfy me enough, 

I needed to have that one-on-one education. But I had to accept that I was deaf, so 

they just went ahead and let me go to work. I t hink when I was 17 or 18 years ol d,

the boss where I was doing weavi ng, he really liked me, I was ki nd of his pet. He 
liked m y designs. A very small town, where he lived, the boss invited me to their 

house to work. There was one town, then 
Hamburg
, and another town. The bombs 
started happening i n 
Ha mburg
, and destroyed everything. My parents evacuated, 
they went south. I stayed in the island. I stayed in the isl and Œ on the island. I 
begged my boss to cont act my parents, but he refused. He just tol d me to sta y put , 
and I cried so much. I hoped that 
my
 parents were still al ive. I di dn™t  know if they 
were dead or alive, t here was no contact for a month. And finally, we received word 

that m y parents were al ive. Then my boss allowed me to go and t o see m y parent s. 

And I sta yed in the south, in 
Bavaria
.  

Q: A-Ask her how Œ how old was she when she Œ when she left school, and then 

how old was she when she left Œ 
A: I was 14 when I left school. 
Q: And when did you l eave home? 

A: Around 16. Our house was dest royed by fire. My father had many, many books 

in the fire, destroyed all of them but one. My brother and I Œ the three of us, my 

deaf brother and I Œ 
th
e other brother and sister were gone. One was in the arm y, 
m y other sister was gone, m y deaf brother and I, we were with m y parents, and we 

saw what was left. A lot of people died from the bombings and t he fires.

Q: Can we go back? When she was in school, and talked about what happened 
when the st eriliz Œ how they were told by t heir teacher, when the steri lization law 

took effect? One moment. 
[brea k]
 So again, my question is when did she fi Œ how 
did she find out about the sterilizati on law, and how did they tal k to her about it in 

school?  
A: In the class, the teacher came int o the room and said, good morning. There were 
six boys and four girls, and I was one of the girls. We were all sitting i n like a 

semicircle. The teacher was standi ng up by the window. He was l ooking Œ we were 

just waiting. The teacher didn™t teach anything. We were wondering what was 

wrong. Then came a m an from the government. It was very interesting, and he said 

to all of us, school  students Œ he was explaining to us how to breathe. And 
you must 
go to the hospital for st erilization. And we sai d what? Why? What do you mean, go 
to the hospital for steril ization? He explained t hat when you grow up and get 
married, you won™t be able to have a baby. We said, huh? It means we can™t have a 

baby? We all looked at  each other. We really didn™t understand. Then he left. I went 

home, and I told m y m other. My mother reall y didn™t explain it t o me. Later I found 

out that my mother had gotten a let ter from them. No, wait, forget, just a moment. 

The y chose an 11 year old girl from m y cl ass. She had deaf parents. They took them 

all to the hospital at one ti me, and sterilized them. When t he y came back Œ we were

young, we really di dn™t  understand. Especi ally, clearly, we didn™t understand what 
it all meant. Well, we just thought nothi ng of it, and conti nued pla yi ng. My father, I 

was like hi s pet, he reall y l oved me. And I felt funny. I tol d m y mother, why is my 

father so affectionate and loves me so much, as compared with m y other sisters and 

brothers? Why, what™s wrong? Mother sai d, oh your father likes you just like 
everybody else. Everybody™s equal . He loves to see you smile, though. He called 
me sunshi ne. Then, as the ti me became near, I remember very well, I was in the 

kitchen, and I was cleaning. My mother came and said, 
Helga
, si t down. And she 

explained, you have to go to the hospital i n two days. I said, I have to go to the 

hospital to get steri lized? I was cal m. I kind of accepted it. My mother must have 

thought something was wrong, or that I was going to run awa y, or get crazy, but I 

was very calm. She said, how come Œ later she asked me, how come you were so 
cal m? And I said, well, the other girls had it done, so I just accepted it, that it was 
fair. If they did, I guess it was my turn. My father cried. He refused to see me. He 

didn™t want  to hug me before I left home to go to the hospital. It  was a very small, 

cute hospital, very nice place actually. Babies Œ only babies were born there. A 

woman did the surgery. Gave me anesthetic and a shot, that everyt hing was good 

and clean. After the surgery, I woke up, I was t hrowing up, and I coul d Œ I could 

feel something heavy on m y stomach. My mother was sitting next to me, and I

tapped her, she was like sleeping. I said, Mummy, Mummy. The second sister 
underneath me, opened the door and looked in and said hi . Her bi g e yes looked i n at 

me, and I was laughing. She was so funny, to see her just t hese two big eyes, poking 

through the door. Oh, but the pain when I l aughed, oh-ho, great pain. I said go 

away. Where 
was my father? He couldn™t come. He was so embra Œ embarrassed, 
because he was crying for me. Later, two of my schoolmates came, and the three of 

us just sat and cried. 

Q: Did she know Œ did she know Œ well, to go back a little bit, when Œ how old was 

she when t hat man first  came in, and then how old was she when the Œ the operation 

happened to her? 

A: I was 11 or 12 years old. The other girl was 11 when she went to t he hospital, I 

hadn™t gone to the hospital I was Œ until I was 16. The y were hopi ng that I wouldn™t 
have to go, but I wanted to become a grandmother, you see, and t hat™s the reason Œ 
or, the y wanted to become a grandmother if I Œ I had a chi ld, and that™s the reason 

m y mother was cryi ng, and m y father, too. 

Q: Did she un Œ di d you understand why t his was happening, why they were doi ng 

this?  

A: Not unt il later. Years later. When I moved t o the 
United States
 in 1954, five 

years later, I went back to 
Germany
 for a visit. I saw my baby si ster. She had a

beautiful baby. The baby was so beautiful, I got to hold the baby. And that morning, 
m y sister was feeding t he baby, and then I realized what I felt, when I realized I 

couldn™t have any children. I started to cry, and I Œ I ran i nto the bathroom, and j ust 

cried and cried. When I came back out, my sist er said, what™s wrong, what™s the 

mat ter? I said, oh, I™m just crying because I™m happy for you because you have a 
beautiful child. Then the next da y I saw other people, and I Œ wit h babies, and I 
cried. And as I got older, I tried to forget about  it. 

Q: How old was she when this Œ when this happened, when she took this trip? 
Was 
she married, or was she single, or Œ  

A: I was married then. I was 35 years old, about. 

Q: Did Œ did Œ did the officials, the government officials, or your family, explain 

why this h ad to happen to you? Why this operation was going to happen? 
A: My mother™s brother was a judge, and he was trying to help us, to prevent the 
operation. He was not successful. Oh, he was not a member of the Nazi regi me, so it 

didn™t work. My father was the same wa y. I was a Girl Scout, and they were trying 

to force me to become a member of the Nazi party. I said oh, no. They said, you 

must. I sai d, why? Because you can speak with hearing people, and other Œ and 

children. Well, my mot hertaught mehow tospe
ak. They gave me the paper, told 

me I had to go to t he flag Œ where t he flag was, and sign some papers. I refused. My

weaving boss invi ted me to the island to sta y, and I went there and I told the 
teacher, I™m leaving for the island, they invited me. I don™t  know how long I™ll stay. 

She said, bring the papers with you. You must go in there with your papers, and 

take them with you everywhere. My heart sank. I felt so much fear, for a very long 

time. I would sleep, and then I would wal k to work. The Nazis, t wo of them, would 
stand there with their flags, as I walked by. I had the papers with me all the ti me. 
Should I go or not , should I go or not? I woul d pass them. I was afraid the y™d pull 

me back by m y hair, but they didn™ t, I™d sa y no. And every da y this would happen, 

and I™d be filled with fear as I walked past t hese two men with their flags. And t he y 

were bombing 
Hamburg
. And I needed a rest , and I thought I needed some relief. 

But I heard later that  our teacher was dead from t he bombs. Then, when I went t
o 

the south, t o join with m y father and mother, I still had those papers with me. Then, 
during the war, then we saw the white flag. Bombs were everywhere. And now I 
could clai m Œ 
come to 
Œ from south, I went to Œ could go to 
America
. Before I 
came to 
America
, in 
Germany
, the Ameri cans Œ the Germans, we lost the war. 
Hitler
 died;  that was good. When we saw the white flag, it meant that we had gi ven 

up, that there was no more war. The American soldiers saw us, and they t ore the 

papers, threw them away, threw them in t he fireplace, and burned t hem up. Boy, did 

I feel relieved. Then years later, I wanted to come to the 
USA

helped us, t he y Œ to support us for five years. And after five years, I became an 
American cit izen. Before, in 
Germany
, in 
Hamburg
, m y husband and I asked his 
aunt and uncle Œ they li ved in 
Michigan
, 
Detroit
, 
Michigan
 Œ we came as an immi 
Œ as immi grants, and they were very happy t o help us, to support us. But the aunt 

and uncle went to t he American consulate, and at the consulate they asked for 
papers, and the y tol d them about m y husband and I, that we were deaf. They turned 
us down. They sa y deaf was not allowed t o come to the 
United States
. I was very 

disappointed. Two years later, one American man from 
Boston
 Œ he was dea
f 
hi mself, we became good friends. We told him about wanting t o come to the 
States
, 
and we said we were looking for freedom. And I had read books about
 
America
, 
and I was so i mpressed. This man said, good. He helped us go to the American 

consulate, and asked for our papers, and he said, I will support them. They turned us 
down again. Second time I was di sappointed.

Washington
,
 D
.
C
. Hetypedout everything, and 
finall y they allowed us to come to the 
Uni ted States
, thanks to t his gentleman from 

Boston
. We had been waiting for two years on a Œ on a list. There were many 
people. Finally, the y called us Œ well, actually, it was less than two years Œ the y 
called us to come to 
America
. The first and second times, there were so many 
questions, and there was a Œ a list. And one of the questions that t he y asked, had 

you been a member of the Nazi party? And I answered, no. And in my mind I 

looked back, and I t hought, if I had said yes, they wouldn™t let us come to the 
U
.
S
., 
if I had joined, way back when. This is true. So I™m so happy that that never took 

place, that t he y didn™t force me. So they swore us in. You have to obey the laws in 

the 
United States
, and they explai ned some of the rules, and we s
aid yes, yes,I do, 
I do. 
Q: Oka y, let™s go back, and again I Œ I need to know how Œ if they explained why 

this operation needed t o hap Œ needed to happen to you deaf children? 

A: Because m y 
[interruption]  
Q: The question is Œ 

A: The y explained t o the deaf children that they didn™t want deaf children Œ that 

they had to be steril ized because the y didn™t want deaf children t o have children

who would grow up and be deaf as well. So this is how t he y explained it to us. And 
m y b r
other was deaf, as well as me. So a long time ago, i n the generation, it just  
happened to the two of us, we don™t know why. So this other classmat e of mine, her 

parents were hearing, and she was free from it, because her father was a member of 

the Nazi party. 
Q: Did you think, because there was so much time that passed, from the time that 
they first told you, til you were 16 and the y took you for the operation, did you Œ 

did you thi nk all t hat time that you were st ill possibly going to get this operation? 

A: Well, real ly, I wasn™t even thinking about it . My mother didn™t explain it to me 

enough, and the teacher certainly didn™t explai n it to all of us. Once was enough, 

that was all, once they t old us, and not more than that. So I didn™t real ly give it 

much thought. 
Q: Did anyone, eit her i n your family, or i n the school, try to stop them from doi ng 
these operati ons?  

A: The school, people from the school, but not  my family. 

Q: Oka y, she has t o, again, nobody™s going to know what  I asked her. 

A: The man that came from the government to our school, told the teacher to choose 

which children that we should send to the hospital for sterilization. 

Q: Did a Œ but, di d anyone try to stop them from doing it?

A: My uncle, who was a judge, tried to stop it from happening, but he failed. 
Q: Oka y. After Œ no, that™s 
[indecipherable]
 I™m sorry. After the war, how did t he 
operation affect your plans to marry? 

A: My husband Œ I felt sorry for my husband. He Œ he was sterilized t oo, and he had 

gotten the letter. And they sent him to the hospital, and he refused, he rebelled 
against it. Then he got a second lett er, and he rebelled agai n. The t hird ti me, they 
came
 and took hi m to t he hospital. Without any anesthetic, the y just t ied his hands 
down, and the y sterilized him. And he screamed. But he was very strong in his 

mind, very wonderful. He was a good sportsman. He was in the Olympic swi mmers 

Œ he was an Olympic swimmer. After the operation, no, he went downhill. 

Q: Was thi s Œ 

A: So, he was looking for a woman, and then he found me. And I was a good 
swimmer, too. So we had peace of mind, neither of u Œ neither of us could have 
children. So, it Œ it was a good marriage, in that sense. 

Q: How old was her husband when Œ when they did this to hi m? 

A: I think i t was 17 or 18 years old, I think. 

Q: He was 17 or 18 years old, what?  

A: When the y steril ized hi m. His aunt from 
Michigan
 had come to see hi m. My 
husband must have gone to the hospital for sterilization, and m y Œ

said, come with me, come with me. And t he Œ he said no. He was in t he headlines 
because he was a famous swimmer, like 
Johnny Weissmuller 
was i n the 
States
. 
He kept all of these clippings together, and hi s aunt did. And hi s father said to hi m, 

you have to pla y with girls before you have a baby, before you get sterilized. And 

he said no, I don™t want  to play with girls. 
Q: So Œ 
A: But it failed. The y t ook hi m anyway. 

Q: So even though he was a famous, admi red athlete, that didn™t keep them from 

doing this to hi m? 

A: No. I don™t know why, but they didn™t  ask hi m any questions, real ly. I really 

don™t like to think of the past so much, and he didn™t think about it. We now have to 

look forward. I feel sorry for so Œ thousands of people who died. They had it Œ i n 
the camps, t he y had it worse than I did, act uall y. I™m thankful. I™m very t hankful. 
I™m still ali ve. I™m 80 years old. I can cli mb, I can do lots of things. 

Q: I have a question. It sounds like your famil y life was wonderful.  

A: Yes. 

Q: So, to your parents, there was nothing wrong with you, but you couldn™t hear Œ 

except you couldn™t hear. And then the government comes Œ and then the 

government  comes, and sa ys you™re defective.

A: Defective? My parents were very proud, and the y were proud that I could come 
to the 
United States
, t hey applauded that, wit hout an interpreter, j ust  the two of us, 

ourselves. Because t hat  world was certainly di fferent. And I learned English. In 

Germany
, I learned English there, too. I could say goodbye, I love you, thank you. 
Just a little bit of English, and then I progressed. 
Q: But Œ but m y questi on is, when you were a child there, in Œ 
in the school,when 
they were doing these operations, did you suddenly feel like something was wrong 

with you,t hat you 
Œ before, you di dn™t feel like anything was bad about you, and 
then now somebody™s t elling you you™re no good. Is that Œ was that Œ 
A: Later, I woke up, when I realized it was because I coul dn™t hear. I was really 

very innocent, when I was younger. 

Q: So in fact, she didn™t know why the y were doing the operation? 
A: Just so Œ I Œ I knew that the y were doing the operation so I couldn™t have 
childrento perpetuate deafness
. 

Q: Oka y. So she did know why. 

A: Yes, I knew why they were doing the operation. 

Q: Oka y. Do you have any more questions that you™d like to know about this? 

Cause really, I pretty m uch got everyt hing. No, I™m asking you, 
Ronnie
(ph).

Q3: I have one 
[indeci pherable]
 
Q: Oka y, yeah. 
Q2: I had Œ  I had a few, but Œ  

Q3: The Œ t here was the conversati on about some papers that she carried with her 

for a long time, and then were torn up, and I never quite understood what those 
papers were. But apparently they were bad papers, the Americans tore them up. Can 
you explain what t he papers were? 

A: It said that Œ it said that it was Œ I was a member of the Nazi party, because I was 

a Girl Scout. So t hose Œ those papers that I carried said I Œ I was a leader of the Girl 

Scouts, and so I had to carry those papers that said I was a member of the Nazi 

party. I really wasn™t, but that™s what the papers said. The y were forci ng me to go, 

to join, but in the back of m y head, I knew, God helped pull me back. I would not 
go in. I had the papers to become a member, but I wouldn™t do it. And every day 
when I would walk from t he house to the job, and the Œ 
I wouldpass by thesoldiers, 

I would just feel the fear that the y might ask if I was a member or not. And for 

years, this went on. After am Œ
 
America
 
claimed 
Germany
, that™s when I felt like a 
bird, free, I could fl y free. 

Q: But the papers said she was a member of the Nazi party?

A: The y weren™t filled in. The papers were not  filled in, I just carried them with me. 
There were no answers, and I hadn™t signed the papers, so they di dn™t  really say 

anyt hing. I didn™t sign them. An American soldier said I must go to m y boss, and 

ask for a file, to see if I had anything on my re cord, but I had a clean record. There 

was Œ the Nazi had a huge file in the basement, and the y found papers. And then 
because I knew some of Œ some of the people, some of m y friends™ uncles or 
nephews, t he y came to the Œ from 
Bulgaria
 
to the 
United States
, and they said, do 
you remember Œ and they asked hi m, were you a member of the Nazi  party? And 

they denied it, so t he y said, okay, you™re accepted. And then they coul d support 

these people when they came to 
America
. When you went to the American 
consulate, you had to take an oath to tell the truth. And t he y asked, are you a 

member of the Nazi part y. And somebody confessed to sa ying yes, they t ook their 
file, they put their name in the file. So I was afraid that that same thi ng would 
happen to me, so I never signed those papers. 

Q: 
Ro nni e
(ph), do you have any questions that Œ that arose during thi s? 
Q2: As a deaf woman, did you know German sign language? And then how, when 

you came to 
America
, did you learn American sign language? 

A: I would meet friends, and 
Iaskedthem to help me
, and I Œ I picked up a 

dictionary, English
-German, German and Engl ish, so I could learn different signs.

And the Lutheran preacher at the church, I asked him to come to m y aunt and 
uncle™s house to teach me finger spelling and sign language, for one year. And 

that™s how I learned. 

Q: What happened t o your brother, with regard to the sterilization? Was he 

supposed to be sterilized also? 
A: No, he Œ they didn™t  sterilize hi m, he has twin daughters. The y™re both hearing. 
Beautiful girls. He was lucky.  

Q: How Œ how did he manage to escape Œ 

A: He didn™t avoid it, he was supposed to go to the hospi tal, but the hospital was 

full, and it was wartime. And then he Œ soldiers and people were bei ng rushed t o the 

hospital. There was no available space for hi m, so he didn™t go, t he y did not steri lize 

hi m. He was very happy. 
Q: Did you Œ 
did you 
Œ  did your parents Œ 
A: I was happy. People would ask me, do you feel bad that your brother has two 
children, you don™t  have any? No, I™m very happy that he has twins. I™m just happy 

that I have two beautiful nieces. 

Q: Did Œ did Œ did the Œ did any health officials, or anyone come to your family to 

explain that  they thought deafness was heredit ary?  

A: No, nothing.

Q: There was no conver Œ da Œ discussions about that? 
A: When I was 28 years old, I came to the 
Uni ted States
. It™s a Œ 
Germany
, during 
warti me, was different. It was very Œ a very rough life over there
, but itwas 

different here. 

Q: But when you were going through thi s operation, or when they took Œ when t he y 
took you for this operation, did anybody explai n that deafness was hereditary, and 
this was something that the y had to do, or Œ  

A: No, nothing. Nothing was explained. Only once did the teacher say, t ol Œ tell  us 

that you can™t have babies, we™re going to make you not have babi es, so that the 

deafness doesn™t become perpetuated, and that was it. Just one ti me.  And we di dn™t 

have any time really, to focus on it. It was a very confusing time for al l of us. All 

the ti me, confusion. 
Now, you™re maki
ng me l ook back on it in more Œ more in 
depth. I didn™t realize about the deaf world itself back then. So they would call 
some of them mentally retarded. The y would mai nstream them in a church. Oh, all 

of us, deaf people, mentally retarded people, they would put them Œ there was a 

church, and a lot of the people died, from fire. Most of them were mentally 

retarded. They would t ake them awa y to this church. And years later, some of the 

kids were still alive. Most, if they were deaf, t hey were allowed to go to the church.

The y were healthy, except the y just couldn™t hear. And so the y would send them 
off, on their way. 

Q: To where? 

A: You know, to Œ to t he gas chambers, to the camps. I di dn™t know where the y 

were really taking them. One boy came from 
Guatemala
, 
South America
. His 
father sent hi m to school for the deaf. He was two or three years ol der than me. He 
went out of class from school. He liked me. He explained all about  the Nazis, and 

how bad it was, and I l earned a lot from hi m. And I said, how do you know? And he 

said, his uncle took care of him, and his father sta yed in 
So uth America
, and his 
uncle took care of hi m. His uncle told him about the Nazis. And they said they will 

kill everybody. All the German kids. The y™ll sterilize all the German kids. He knew 

so much. That™s when we all Œ I st arted to become afraid, and he was fearful as 
well. I talked to m y fat her, and he would just try to pacify me, and calm me down. 
He™d sa y, don™t worry, don™t worry. My father was very sensitive. My father™s 

sister, m
y aunt Œ and I asked m y aunt, I said, i s 
Hitler 
bad? I went to 
Munich
 for a 
na Œ for a visit with another aunt, and I learned from them that 
H itler
 was bad, and 

we should all be against 
Hitler
, but we have to do it very quietly. They™d listen t o 

the radio, and the y™d hear out of their 
[indeci pherable]
 like from 
England
, or out 
of their country, what t hey were sa ying agai nst 
Germany
, they™d list en very

carefully. The y™d have to be careful, because t here would be a knock at the door, 
and the y™d put them in jail. So I learned from m y aunts, t hen I told my father, the y 

told me
 Hi tler™s
 bad. My father said, shh, shh. He was frightened. He said, you talk 

against 
Hitler
, he™ll put you awa y. They warned that the enem y could hear you all 

over,didn™t  matter where you
 were. So you needed to be careful if you said 
anyt hing i n front of anybody, cause the y coul d take you and send you to the camps. 
So I learned a lot from m y two aunts, and from the boy from 
Guatemala
. 

Q: Ask her how ol d she was when this 
[i naudible]
 
A: I was st ill in school. Maybe I was 12 years old, 11 or 12 years old. I™m trying to 

remember. I kind of forget some things, you know, about  the past. 

Q: Oka y, I think we™re done. Okay, we need to sit and be quiet for 30 seconds.
