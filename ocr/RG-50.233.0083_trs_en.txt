Memories of Judith Kalman Mandel. 
 
 
 

            I promised long time ago, 1944, that if
 I ever come alive out of the concentration camp I will 
say the tale, that it should never be forgotte
n, what happened to us and could happen to anybody 
else who is surrounded by fear, anger, discrimi nation and so on.  People did not want to listen 

for a long, long time because it wasn™t  nice.  Mystory wasn™t  pleasant.  People had so me  guilt.  

Some  people were totally disinterested so I talked
 as much a s  I could, to my fa mily to whoever 
listened to me .  I want to leave it as a me me nto 
not for me , a nd not for pity for me ; but just to 
let it stay alive. That it should never happen 
again and it should never be forgotten again. 
 

 I was a young girl when it happened.  I was si
xteen and a half.  I was 100 years old when I 
came out.   Like every survivor I have my ow
n s t ory and like every survivor I have my own 
version of it, my own interpretation, my own que
stions.  I give it to you to reme mber, to be 
better by it; to think before you say some thing or
ma ke fun of anybody; or
 belittle anybody, to 
know that it gives a deep wound.  I want to give
 you the courage, the ha
ppiness of being alive 
and be able to see, smell, touch, whatever you wa
nt, and just enjoy life in general. We ll, let™s 
start with the story. 
 

 I come  from an unreligious town, from an unr
eligious family although both grandparents were 
religious.  My parents did not 
kept any more than Rosh Has
honah andYo m Kippur and we were 
first Hungarians and then Jewish. We  were H
ungarians who happened to be Jewish --- very 
proud to be assimilated and very well liked, in th
e beginning.  I come from a little town, most 
people knew each other.  My uncle wa s a fairly 
rich man.  My father was mi ddle class, well 
liked.  My mother was a beautiful, intelligent wo
ma n, looked up to.  I used 
to recite poetry since 
I was three years old and relativel
y pretty child.  I was basking in
 love of my parents and my 
uncle and people around us, so I thought. Then 
slowly, very slowly, everything started to 
change. The different edicts from the author
ity came  and our neighbor did not question why a 
Jew are not allowed to do. We  went along, 
my fa ther and everybody believed the Jewish 
hierarchy who said nothi ng will ha ppen if you k
eep the law. We are Hungarians and nothing 
will happen to you.  Nothing happene d, we stayed 
home. You couldn™t be a white-collar worker 
any more in an office so you became, like my father, a bricklayer. When t he army did not take 

Jewish me n in, they became  working force withou
t uniform, their own clothes. They went into 
and they learned songs and they ma de up new s
ongs that it does not ma tter that we have a – 
how you say it --- you work in the fields for Hunga
ry. They™re still good Hungarians.  I went to 
school, fell in love.  I laughed, 
joked, I bicycled, I recited poetry.  I went to the Jewish 
organizations and slowly I learned that I was a Je
w, very slowly.  By the Hungarian Nazi Party 
emble m on my desk in school or kids spit on us 
and called us name  and of course we gave it 
back. We  fought and yelled and went home . The y
 said they are idiots, ha, ha, ha and don™t be 
hurt.  Just  go for --- like nothing happened. We  did. The edict came , mo re and more.  I 

reme mber when Hitler came on the radio or in the movie theater. We saw the news, and the 

pomp and the marching and the --- all the beauty
 of aWa gner i an night and I felt like a little 
mouse. All the goose steps were coming for me .  But you joked, shook off. The next day was 

another day.  School time came 1942, or ™41 when
 I finished junior high and I couldn™t go to 
high school because I was a Jew.  I couldn™t stay
 home either, just sit home, do nothing; so I 
started to work as a beautician where a richer Je
wish kid could get into a different school, pay 
here and there.  Slowly they we
nt to school and who couldn™t, le
arned a trade like your father, 
like me .  I was supposed to go into a Jewish
 –.  Hungary had one Jewish schoolteacher ™s 

school which didn™t take new pupils. They we
re not allowed and nobody else took me .  So I 
learne d and again life gone on.  I had tutor who 
taught me  when ‚everything will be peaceful 
againﬂ,   I could ma ke my high school easier.  
I reme mber when Hitler walked into Poland.  I 
reme mber some rumors.  I knew my own fa mily, 
friends; all of a sudden, we didn™t hear from 
them.  So you grabbed a little
 tighter around you and loved a 
little more. And we lived. 
 
 1944, March 19, the Germans occupied Hungary.  I was in Budapest. That was my bi g chance 
to recite in a big Jewish auditorium.  I coul
dn™t and I sneaked back to my home town Hatvan, 
which was not far from Budapest. Then the me n were taken to working camp, all the me n up to 

sixty. The women went home and came the edicts 
again. You had to put on the yellow star, you 
had to move  into the ghetto.  From the ghetto, you 
were taken out to a factory, a sugar factory.  
From there we were taken to unknown destinati
on. Whoeve r was afraid was calmed down that 
you don™t have to be afraid, we will be  taken 
to a camp --- not a camp, a town where all the 
Jews will be together. We ™ll lear n and we believed. That™s how it was . . . . 
 

 I reme mber so well like yesterday when they took
 us out the first time  to work in the fields.  
They took out 50 people from the ghetto.  Meanwh
ile in the ghetto, they collected money, the 
Germans and the Hungarian Nazis, for us.  My mo
ther pulled me  with her.That™s wa y, after a 
full day™s work, we were comi ng back and the peopl
e of this lovely little town stood there while 
we had to march in the mi ddle of the gutter, 
singing and kissing the ground where the horses 
were going before. The people, they stood 
by and laughed and chee
red and clapped.  I 
reme mber the faces around me .  I reme mber the f
ear of dying.  Got me  like a knife.  I reme mber 
the hatred what came into me  when I saw my
 so-called friends in the crowd laughing and 
pointing at me.  I re me mber other times when 
my friend next door wouldn™t say hello to me  
when I had to wear the ye llow star. There were 
some  nice people --- went out their way to say a 
kind word; probably very ashame d of it.  But 
nobody raised a question, nobody asked why. All 
of a sudden, good law abiding citizens became lowe
r than dirt. The property was taken, the 
freedom was taken away.  Fear was planted.  I 
saw people being beatenin the street and nobody 
came to rescue.  I reme mber the Hungarian 
so-called police who be
at us unmercifully, 
unme rcifully. You learned to be quiet; you learne
d to be a Jew and talked about Palestine and 
you were no more Hungarians.  I reme mber when we
 had to give in the jewelry, the radios, the 
bicycles, the record players, 
all the treasure, the jewelry,
 my mother ™s wedding band.  I 
reme mber when we were allowed only 50 pounds, excuse me , 100 pounds, 50 kilos out of the 

home  to go to the inner ghetto.  My mother
 saved, since I was a baby, my  hope chest and 
tearing all up.The photo albums, tear out the pi
ctures and leave my house .  Everything on our 
back.  My mother and I were the last to be ta
ken out from our  home  because my father was so 
well liked, big deal, I loved him.  I reme mber my
 mother ™s tears and her cries when I took the 
beautiful and never used Czechoslovakian dishes, glass dishes, and cracking them together 

saying, if I can™t use it, nobody else should.  She 
had a pearl necklace, Ri
chleau pearl they call 
it here.  It was not round shape, it™s  more like 
different size, more like pear shape.  I threw it 
into the bathroom, the toilet.  If I coul dn™t have
 it, nobody else will.  But 
Ireme mber my mother 
cleaning up the house before we left, it should be 
neat.  I™m fi ghting with her, leave them and 
burn this and let not have --- they enjoy it and 
my mother smiled and said, oh, we™ll come back 
here.  I also reme mber two peasants comi ng who 
loved my father and wanted to hi de us like --- 

as we live inYonkers, one in New Rochelle woul
d hide me  and the other would hide my mother 
in Hastings.  Being we were so uninforme d to
 know what™s  comi ng and what™s  going on in the 
world, my mother refuse d saying, I can™t  go aw
ay from my c hild. Whatever happens, will 
happen with us two because I can™t  be separate
d. We ll, Mengele separated us, Dr. Mengele in 
Auschwitz.  My mother wanted to kill herself as
 we were going on this train toAuschwitz and I 

didn™t let her.  I should have, ma ybe, I don™t know
. Anyhow, you learn to be a Jew very, very 
hardly with ma ny, many, ma ny pain and ma ny 
di sappointme nt.  I would envy those who had 
faith, who was brought up as a religious Jewish 
ki d because at least, they had some  ba ckground 
information.  I only was a Hungarian first.  O
h, how I loved the gypsy mu sic which wa s always 
playing and how much I loved the Hungarian poet
s.  How heartily I recited.  I learned about 
Jewish poets and I learned about Palestine.  Our 
Jewish hierarchies, even
 our rabbi in that time 
didn™t appr ove of it. They only told us to follow the rules and follow the laws and nothing will 
happen. We  are Hungarian and nothing could happen 
to us.  Hungary will not let us go. Then 
you learn in the Eichma nn time, that Hunga
ry paid the German to take us out. 
 

 June 12, 1944, we were taken from Hatvan into a fr
eight train and we starte
d our journey.  June 
15, we arrived toAuschwitz. This was the first 
time I ever heard of the word,Auschwitz.  It 
was a big, immense place with horrible smell.  Pe
ople were running with sticks in pajama s, 
pajama -looking things, no hair.  I asked my mother 
are we in an insane asylum?  We  were taken 
out from the  train and all our va
lise, our papers, our identificati
on are staying in the train. We  
have to go in front of the SS ---- we were selecte
d, one to right, one to left.  I was taken from 
my mother.  I was sent to right.  She was sent to
 left.  My girlfriend w
ho was in the next line 
heard Mengele and the forema n talking to my 
mother who was crying. 
Why are you crying?   
Your daughter is going ahead of you, waiting for you with coffee and bed.  Just go with the rest .   

You™re so young and beautiful, shou
ldn™t have a big girl 
like yours, just go with the rest and you 
will see your daughter shortly.  My mother went 
and I went.  She was 38 years old.  I was taken 
to a bathhouse.  I had a belt, a wide leather be
lt which my mot her sewed in money and a switch 
knife.  If ever anybody tried to a
ttack me , I should use it. Wh oe
ver heard that; you will be in 
rags, hairless, name less, some ti me s walking na
ke d because there was no clothes for me . We  
were taken into a big barrack. You didn™t 
know who was there and there were about 1,000 
people in one barrack. We  were sleeping on th
e floor. Wa s no food, there was no toilet, there 
was no dignity. There was nothing. You get up at
 three in the morning, they counted you and 
then they herd you back again to the same ro
om. You couldn™t  go out. You put your hand --- 
one put the hand on the hairless head 
just to see if it™s ni ghtmare or 
if it™s real. Then I cried and 
I asked one of the kapo, a Slovakian
 girl, where™s my mother?  She pointed to a chimney.  She 
said she™s burning over there.  Of course 
you couldn™t believe that. You saw your friend, you 
didn™t see yourself and you starte
d to laugh because you couldn™t r
ecognize it in that condition.  
Then slowly it dawned on you that 
this is it, it™s real, it™s  there 
and you lived. You try to adjust 
and for m a new fa mily, you had to belong.  Some body you have to love and love yourself and it 

was very hard there to love, even yourself or 
your neighbor. You fought 
for everything, a piece 
of apple on the floor, so nobody should step on you.  
And the bread, you had to hide it.  I never 
hide my bread, I always ate it.  I always
 was hungry, imme ns ely hungry and hunger hurt.  
Believe me, hunger is pain. There were three 
things what hold me  up high --- hold myself up 
high.  I never stole from my fellow-inma tes; 
I never fought for food; and I never sat on the 
ﬁkubleﬂ. The kuble was a barrel which I took out a
nd brought in but I never sat on it.  It was the 
lowest point --- lowest thing in my eyes, it 
was filled with diarrhea and everybody™s shit and 
everybody™s urine and it™s all over.  I couldn™t sit 
on it; in front of everybody.  But I got up in the 
morning and I took it out to the latrine beforeanybody.  I was in the latrine committee rather 

than sit on it.  It™s  ridiculous, it™s stupid but it 
held me  back.  It™s called dignity.  Huma n dignity 

for a sixteen year old. The food wha t  we get was 
garbage.  It was deliber
ately over salted if we 
get anything and then they didn™t give us water;
 or they give us black coffee without sugar or 
some  kind of tea.  It was too early yet in the stage 
to be able to eat it. We  were in this place for 
about three weeks. At July, about two weeks wh
en I was taken to Krakow Plaszow ---  to me  
Krakow Plaszow was the worst place.  It was a Je
wish cemetery. There we took out the ma rble 

grave ma rkers were taken into Krakow to redone
 the gutters.  Many times
 you hit into the earth 
and you came up with skeleton or piece of bone and 
heads and the work was horrible.  It wasn™t  
productive work, it was sheer tort
ure. We  took how you call it --- 
gravestones, big stones.  Six, 
seven, eight girls were taken as
 horses and had to pull wagons.  
There were beating, constant 
beating, bi g German she pherds were --- trained d
ogs to go back in after the woman™s breast and 
me n™s testicles and pull them apart if one went 
out of the line.  I saw 
the Ge stapo beating and 
asking people, you know, for some  stupid secrets.  
I saw them being tortur
ed --- this is where I 
saw young children taken out and halfway alive stil
l, burning on the fire and screaming. There 
was no God, God didn™t listen and I said there 
was no God.  But still we tried. You had a 
huma n dignity and you choked down the garbage th
at was called food. When hunger was very 
hurting, you cried.  Nobody else saw and the si
x, seven girls were band together, you had 
nobody else. They delegated one as a mother and 
took care.  One went for water and one went 
for food and one tried to save the other.  Keep up the spirits and we joked.  Every time you felt 
like crying, then we laughed.  One was an opera si
nger who sang and I recite
d poetry at night.  
Another teacher taught us some thing. We  talked
 about resi st ance --- that was our resistance.  
They could not push us that low 
or that down. You hang on to hu
ma nity and they were gone.  I 
became sick, I was taken to the hospital there 
in Krakow.  I had typhoid fever and I lived it 
through.  I sa ng. The Polish Jews, they were sti
ll in their ghettos and they had some  --- some  
had food.  So they told me  to sing, they would gi
ve me  food.  I had fever and I sang and I sang.  
Some times I get food. Then there were rumors that we will be  taken again.  My friend came  

and sneaked me  out of the hospital.  Hid me  in
 the so-called bed and we were taken out again 
back toAusc hwitz. 
 

 Krakow was the worst place for me  a nd the worst was the captain on a white horse.  I don™t 
know his name .  I know he was hanged after.  
Krakow, I got so ma ny beatings and I thought 
many ti mes about killing myself.  Can™t live like th
is --- going to the electric wire.  I had a 
friend, her name was Kathy. Was a beautiful, intellig
ent, sweet girl, full of fire.  She gave me  a 
big speech.  She told me  that look 
at me , I eat all the shit what 
they giving here and I™ll go home  
and I™ll give it back.  Everything 
I get and I live it through and look at me .  She slipped and as 
she slippe d, she was fa lling toward the wire. She 
grabbed the live wire an
d she was dead in a 
second, that was Kathy. There were other gi rls, 
a girl friend, Susie.  Her eye was --- one of the 
kapo started to hit her and hit he
r in the eyes.  Her eyes were comi ng out.  She was blinded in 
one eye.There were constant beating and figh
ting and killing.  If not the German, then the 
Jewish kapos.  For a gold t
ooth, they killed people and pulled out their teeth.  Food was 
everything.  It was some thing what constant
ly was on everybody™s thought and we became  
skinnier and sicker and filled w
ith boils and ragged. They only gave us rags and lice with them.  
We  had horrible, horrible time. The fear from 
one another, from one Jew to the other and the 
German laughter and they came in clean beautiful
 clothes and touched us with a white glove 
only. You felt lower and lower. Then you said
 no, I™m not lower, I™m just as good, I™m better 
than them. There was a young German ma n, a German SS, who saw me  once.  It was in 

August, we were working in the field and it was a 
peculiar weather.  It was extremely cold in 
the morning and the night but it was very hot in 
the daytime.  He was drinking from hi s canteen.  
As he was drinking, I was swallowing.  He turned
 around and he offered me  his drink from his 
own canteen. To me, I was in rags and filth and I looked at him and I said, you™re offering me?  

He said, yes, why not?   I don™t 
hate you.  I looked at him and I said then how could you look 
around and see this?   He said, I 
don™t care,  I™m only following
 orders.Tomorrow I™ll shoot you 
without a doubt if they tell me  to do so.  I looke
d at him and I said, oh, just tell me  one thing, 
how could you sleep after this?  How could you pu
t your head down and go to church or tend to 
your friend, go home  and kiss a girl.  Could you ever
 live like norma l peopl
e again.  He said, oh 

yes, I™m only following orders. This was alre
ady July, 1944 when theAmericans were already 
in France.  I didn™t know about my fat her.  I didn™
t believe that my mother was dead. We  left 
again and we  hoped again. The rumors were fl
ying that tomo rrow we™re
 going home.  Or we 
will be away from here or they™re taki ng us here
 or there. You hang on to hopes.  I reme mber 
when we we re in that assassination against Hitler, 
they tried --- an attempt to assassinat e him.  
Every tenth of the prisoner was 
killed. We  didn™t know why.  I reme mber when they were taken 
from us.  It was extremely quiet in our barracks.
  Some body started to pray. That passed too.  I 
reme mber rape was done to us.  Not by Germans,
 by kapos. Although it didn™t have to be rapes 
because there was a price. A girl™s pr ice wa
s a piece of buttered brea
d, a wome n™s price on the 
ma rket was a piece of bread and an onion because  was less work.  I never was tempted to go 

there. Wa s too low.  Maybe it would be a little 
more, I mi ght have been. Hunger is very painful.  
I was constantly, constantly hungr
y and thirsty.  I find my frie
nd, my all-time best friend since 
childhood, selling me  water for bread.  InAugust, we were taken, evacuated from the Krakow 

Plaszow ghetto, we were taken back toAuschwitz.  
That was a three days™ trip. This is the fi rst 
time they gave us herring inAugust, and didn™t gi
ve us water for three days. They put us in a 

train.  First 80 people in a freight 
train. Then they put more and 
more and more into it.  People 
went absolutely crazy.  Hunger hurt but thirst 
is much worse. There were people who drank 
their own urine and drank thei
r blood and died.  Everybody was fighting for just to put down 
their feet to be able to stand. We  throwed the de
ad ones in one end of the train. Then we arrive 
inAuschwitz.  Oh yeah, in between time , they
 once opened the train --- we  were yelling for 
water, begging for water.  One soldier came with
 water and threw at us, wouldn™t let us drink.  
We  arrived inAuschwitz. There was again a sele
ction and I was again survived.  I was sleeping 
another barrack the whole night.  I was with my 
aunt from night to morning and I didn™t  know 
it.  She only find me  in the morning when we spe
nding the night to be taken to another part of 

Auschwitz.  She was working near the crematoriu
m.  She was working with the Canadians, the 
white kerchiefs, ﬁgirlsﬂ. They had a ﬁgood pos
itionﬂ. They could get the food, they were 
separating the clothing and f
ood from the deported luggage. 
 (End ofTa pe 1, SideA) 

 I asked her where my mother was and she told 
me  about the crematorium.   I was beaten and I 
saw her being beaten.  She spit out her tooth 
and I spit out two tooth.  But I had some body, I 
know that some body in my fa mily was alive in 
that time .  I learned the fact that my 
grandmother died, my mother died, my cousins di
ed and I believed that first kapo who told me  
that they are burning people here. That was the fi
rst time  I believed it.  I didn™t want to live nor 
did I want to die any more.  
I didn™t fought to be alive. 
 

 I was just lucky or unlucky. Anybody, any surv
ivor who says to you or to anybody, I was lucky 
because I did this so I survived.  Or I did that
 and I was smart or I did this and that™s why I 
survived. They are all lying.  Or  ma king it --- they just believe in
 that because it was sheer luck 
who ca me  back and who didn™t.  Just sheer luck.  
 

 So we were inAuschwitz again. And this time , we had pritches, bunk beds, we had bad. We  
got gray unifor ms , not the stripe, just plain gr
ay uniform. We  were deloused and we still 
weren™t working.We  we re beaten every time
 some body was hanging out of line and any little 
amount of ﬁ undisciplined behaviorﬂ was good thing 
for beating. The dead was still counted.  
Then in September we were taken intoAugsbur
g factory where we working in an airplane 
factory. That saved my life. . . . .We  were ta
ttooed inAuschwitz in our
 hand. We  got again the 
gray uniform. We  went through again a selectio
n. Again the usual frei
ght train ride.  Five 
hundred of us were taken toAugsburg into a f
actory where the first time I was working outside 
inAugsburg for the bomb.  Cleaning up after th
e bombing.  Many times I found food put down 

where we were expected to go.  October cam
e and we heard about Horthy, our Hungarian 
governor going away to Germany.  No more is
 operating from the German ar my a nd then the 
afternoon we heard that the Hungarian SS part
y took over the governme nts. Again we grouped 
together. We  had a mother, Marta and I ha
d a friend,Ve ronica and another friend who was 
actually from Hatvan, my home town.  Her name  
was Elizabeth, she wa s very good to me . Ve ry 
good it mean always food.  She gave me  food.  Sh
e gave me her portion.  She was a decent gi rl 
otherwise.  Marta was our mother and we cling 
together. We  talked, ta
lked about getting out, 
when will be, if it will be over. We™ll be t
ogether. We  gave up the hope that we will meet 
anybody or find our fami ly more or less.  Some times we believed that we will reach Pa lestine --
- sometimes we didn™t that we ever will wake up even the next  day. We were very happy when 

theAmericans bombed t he city or  even our factor
y. We  cared nothing of being alive.  It was 
unimportant any more. The importance were that 
it should be heard about it. The world Jewry 
should know about it. That Hitler should be 
defeated.  Rumors were constantly flying. 
 

 When I was working finally in the factory itself, 
after two or three months
 of outside duty, I got 
into, in Nove mber, into the factory --- which again I was lucky because it saved me .  I was 

working next to a German woma n one side and next
 to a German man on th
e other side so there 
was no way to sabotaging work. Wh atever we
 done, it went through another German hand.  
One Ger man ma n, a beautiful huma n being, even though they didn™t have much to eat, he gave 

us two heflling, the two prisoners
, the two jailbirds, food ever
y morning.  I find food in my 
place and my friend find food next to her. Ther
e was washing facility here and more or less 
better food. The winter we survived.  I learned 
to walk in wooden shoes 
or without shoes.  I 
learned to sleep while I was work
ing or standing.  I had blood poisoning Christma s time.  I was 
operated on my arms and we had a Jewish doctor w
ith us. Told me that they will cut off my 
arm.  I had about 104, 105 fever and I survived th
at without an aspirin.   I woke up after the 
operation and I tried to touch my ar m and it was 
there..  I went further and my hand was there 
but I was afraid to touch my finge
r, my finger was there.  So I was very lucky all over.  I had 
pleurisy in that place. Also I survived that wi
thout aspirin even.  I was 
taken out to take out the 
bomb, to put it out. The German 
thought we are very brave but it 
was no fear in us.  It did not 
ma tter if we dead or alive or whatever; but it ma
ttered if a bomb fell on 
them. We were always 
very happy when theAmerican fighters came , th
e airplane came and the bombing was beautiful 

to our eyes. That™s how we were, wished to die.
 Whenever we were taken, they went to the 
shelter --- we  were just taken down into a place 
where we couldn™t escape.  It was delightful.  
We  sang, we ate our food --- whoever saved it.  
I never save d my food, I was very happy to eat 

it. Almost all of us survived in that  pl ace until Ma rch when we were take n out again. 
 

 We  were take n to Muehldorf- Wa ldlager.  In th
at place, my introduction to
 the place were one of 
the young schriber saw me  ---- schriber is a writer
 who wrote the people™s name  and numbers in 
--- he looked up and he said to me , oh my sister. 
 I said you are mi staken, I am not your sist er.  

He took my name, my number, excuse me, he wa
s kissing me.  He jumpe d up and kissed me , 
oh, my sister, my dear sister.  I said no I™m not 
your sister and I told him where I come  from and 
my na me  and serial number. After that, he very
 quietly gave me  the place where to go which 
was --- in there we were sleeping on the good eart
h. There was a trench between the beds.  
There was a trench where we were walking and 
there was a tent over us. Again I saw a ma n, a 
skeleton ma n around us. The place was surrounded 
by electric wire but between one camp to 
the other, between one section to
 the other, there was just norma
l wires.  I went back to my 
barrack or whatever you --- tent, a
nd I get a message from one of the longer-time inmate that I 
was called to the wire where the ma n meets woma
n. These were the hierarchies, the kapos, the 
doctors, etc., they had more energy, more food in 
them to even be able to think, not necessarily 

sex, but be more than huma n who needed comp
anion rather than all 
thinking of food and 
imme diate danger, I think. Anyhow, I didn™t go. 
The second day I was put to work.  I was 
working near the kitchen and at night again I go
t a call to go out to the wire to meet this 
schriber.  I was, I don™t know, proud or stupid or
 what have you --- so I send back a message 
that I am not a cow to be looked 
over and leave me alone. We ll, ne
xt day, I was out to work in 
an underground airport. This was in 1945, Marc
h. They put cement on my shoulder which I 
supposed to climb with two flights up. The 
cement was about 25 kilo, about 50 pounds and to 
take it up two flights.  I just --- they put it on my
 shoulder and I just fell down with it. They put 
it on again my shoulder and I fell with it.  So I 
was beaten back, beaten from the work back to 
the camp which was about a good kilome ter. At th
e door, he was receiving this boy.  His name  
was Eddy Binbaum from Kejnark who was waitin
g there and took my number, took my name , 
my number.  It wasn™t  the name only, the number.
  He started --- as I left he  whispered to me  
and he said, now you comi ng to the wire and I said, 
yes, of course.  I went there and we talked.  
He explained that he thought I was his long lost sister and he was in theWa rsaw ghetto.  He 
gavc me  food through the gates and I was put to
 a very easy job.  I went into the forest 
collecting acorn.  I got even a toothbrush which Ididn™t see for a year, almost a year.  I saw him 

through the gates and we  talked.  I never liked him.
  I always had a fear in me  for him, because 
of hi m, because of his behavior.  I learned a great
 deal from this experience. That you --- in the 
circumstances where you are, you ne ver know what 
you will do just  to survive.  Because if that 
boy would have asked me  in that particular time , af
ter the beating, that if I have to go back there 
or lay down for him, I would have laid down for 
him.  I don™t think I would ever be ashame d of 
it.  I don™t know, it never come  to that point.  
But I could understand a little more. Anyhow I 
come  back to this part for understanding. Then we were there untilApril. 
 

 OnApril 24, noApril 23, there was an airplane
, a bombing and ma ny prisoners escaped. They 
put a --- what you call it, a laousse
rstrauser --- it meant 
a punishme nt stripe into my starting-to-
grow hair.  It™s about three in
ches with cut into the mi ddle of
 your head completely, like an 
Indian or like the Hara Kr ishna 
people except it wa s reversed.  
Anyhow I was taken to the train 
with the rest of the 500 girls and 
the rest of the camp. 
All of a sudden, this 
schriber came with 
two SS me n and called my name  and 
number.  He told the head SS that I™m not able to travel, I 
had typhoid fever.  I should go back with him to 
the camp. As I told you, I had some fear in me.  
I was climbing down when people who were with 
me from my town; they told me, don™t go.  
You will be a whore. You will be hi s lover and th
at™s why he™s doing it.  So I  didn™t.  I went 
down and said I™m much better.  I™m all right
 now and I shouldn™t be taken back. This boy 
quietly told me that it cost him 
a lot of money to take me out of
 the --- a lot of gold, not money -
-- to take me out of the transport because they 
ar e going into Innsbruck and they will kill us all 
with a benzine injection.  Benzine injection th
at we could burn faster.  Meanwhile every time  
we left the camp, likeAugsburg or Mueldorf or 
Waldlager, we saw the Germans trying to er ase 
all track of the camp. The papers and everythi ng
 was burning and they were in a ma d rush to 
clean up after them. Tha t ™s the time when my gr
oup swore that if any of us will be alive, we 
will talk so it shouldn™t be forgotten no matte
r how much the Germans, the SS were trying to 
cover up. Whoever will survive will talk.  So w
ith this knowledge of benzine injections, I 
climbed back to the train and sat there. I 
didn™t tell nobody our future.  I figured whatever 
happens to the rest, should happen to me .  S
it there. April 27, they opened the train, the 
Germans, and they said we ar
e free.  It was a beautiful, sunny, gorgeous afternoon. The town 
name  is Poing, it was spring.  Everybody started 
to run away from the train.  I climbed down 

and I became hysterical.  I cried and I stood by 
the train and I couldn™t get up.  I kissed the 
earth.  I just got paralyzed, I ju
st couldn™t get up.  My friends we
re trying to pull me away from 
the train.  I couldn™t move.  I was skinny a
nd the knowledge of i m
pending death and the  

            benzine injections in my head and 
keeping it secret was just too much. All of a sudden, the 
guards, they say we were free.  It was about a 
good five mi nutes and then
 we heard the machine 
guns. We  were completely surrounded by other 
SS and like a sickle, I don™t know how you say, 
when you see that with the thing in his hand, de
ath and sickle, just went with the ma chine gun, 
went in a complete circle.  I 
saw the girls who we re together, some  of them from the beginning, 
falling. Then I could get up --- oh I jumped, I jumped
 back to the train, back to the freight train 
and we started to pull back our comr ades, the 
gi rls who will be able to pick up. The train 
started again andApril 28, theAmerican bom
b ca me  and started to machine gun our train 
because the Germans at Poing put an anti-aircraf
t wagon to our train. They started to shoot the 
American airplane. TheAmericans came down a
nd, in return, they started to ma chine-gun us.  
That train ride was my l owest_________, the lowe
st point.  I know that I will become a 
musleman a fter that.  It meant not only will you 
be dead --- I gave up.  I know the mi nute when 
I give up.  In that point, when I gave up, I reme mb
er as yesterday.  I even reme mber better than 
yesterda y.  I was in the train and some body left
 a piece of bread, a crumb.  I had a very big 
struggle in me . To steal it or 
not to steal it. Whe n I turned
 around, some body else stole it and 
there was a big fight between the girls. We  get 
low and we were dirty. We  were covered with 
filth and was thinking, look at myself and I sai
d, there is no use.  Maybe the Germans are right; 
that we shouldn™t be alive.  
When the machine guns started, I was standing in a corner where 
there was a little hole looki
ng out the passing wheels.  Everybody who had some body who was 
standing with me  there, two of my girlfriends
, Kathy S and Lili, they
 have some body pull them 
down.  Made room for them to lay down so 
that machine guns shouldn™t hit them.  I was 
standing there and nobody picked me
 or pulled me down no matte
r how much they liked me .  
There was no way to throw myself. The rest of 
the skeletons were dead people and hurt people.  
Some body, some  ma n had a striped un
iform. The y pushed it out to show theAmerican raiders.  
Their machine gun stopped. They went and gone
 around and meanwhile I said my goodbyes in 
my little life, in my little head to everybody.  I 
counted whom I will see again in ot her world.  I 
was very sure that that™s it, that it™s finished. 
 

 May1
st
 in the morning, our camp boys opened the train 
and they said, theAmericans are here.  I 
borned, I reborn May 1
st
.  I was 22 kilos which is about fo
rty pounds.  I reme mber anAmerican 
soldier picked me  up and I was begging him not to 
give me  back to the German again and then I 
don™t know nothing for a week.  I wa
s very lucky again. A doctor friend of mi ne, Dr. Gatheish 
Gabol found me  and he took me  to
 Partenkirchen to a hospital for a week.  He didn™t give me  
food which was very good because anybody who got 
food in the belly in the first couple of 
days, they died. We ll, that™s my story.  I was 
liberated at Seeshaupt, taken to Munich, then to 
Dachau. 
 

 Then I was in an UNRA camp till September.  I had ma ny experience there.  I went home  to 
find my father. Tr ied to pick up 
life.  Met my hus band, lost my firs
t child, waited to go to either 
Israel orAmerica.  Israel, I mean Palestine, 
in that  time there was still the camps in Cyprus 
which I couldn™t bear to go. We  ca me toAmerica. 
 I picked up my life.  I™m happy to be alive.  
Mostly I enjoy every mi nute.  I gain ma ny thi
ng by this experience.  I know I do.  I am a 
different person.  I was a different person when 
I came out of camp.  Now 
that the question is 
up and people are asking and there is interest in our stories, it™s easier fo
r me to --- finally after 
33 years --- to heal my wounds.  I was an atheis
t when I came out of the camp. Then I became 
an agnostic and my children born and raised in. 
When Eichma nn was caught, it didn™t  ma tter to 
me  that they will hang him or not.  It ma de me  
ha ppy that there is a tria
l, there was a trial.  
When the firstAmerican turncoats were show
ed, I became mo re understanding about a Jewish 
turncoat or kapos or collaborators. Whenyou seventeen, everything bl
ack and white; when you 

fifty-one, you can see gray.  I don™t know if I woul
d be --- how I would re
act if it would have 
been presented with the same situation that 
they were, those kapos..  I know now that the 
Germans deliberately pi cked mostly the low peopl
e of our people to --- 
the opportunities to --- 
who were able to take these. They did it deliber
ately so that we  could be
 more angry with what 
was imme di ate object to us, 
another hefling________ another pr
isoner, rather than the 
immaculate god-like clean Germans.  Neverthele
ss, when anAmerican Jew says I™m proud to 
be a Jew, I think of the kapos.  I™m not proud tobe anything.  I™m proud to be me .  I™m proud to 
be a human being.  Maybe, just ma ybe there is
 a little saying what I 
read some where -- if 
anybody else, not the Jewish people, would have b
een put in the same  situation, they wouldn™t 
only fight with mouth, they probably woul
d kill each other -- which didn™t happen. 
 

 I learned huma n nature.  Nobody™s perfect includ
ing myself.  I learned tolerance on ma ny, ma ny 
things but I can™t  tolerate self-pity.  I very seld
om indulge pity in me , for  me .  I™m like the steel; 
I love my fa mily probably more than it™s normal
 but they are the most important thing to me  
after my freedom --- before my freedom. They fi
rst and then freedom.  It™s nice to have nice 
things but I could be very well without it. Whenev
er I felt low, I have to think very far, how 
lower I was before so everything 
after that is just high up. It™s  
hard for me  to see the flower 
picked because I know it will di e but everythi ng is
 already easy after that experience. You can™t 
be afraid of dying.  I™m neither afraid of ag
ing. When you were sixteen and never thought you 
will be 17, you™re just not afraid of it, of dying, or aging. 
 

 Israel, when I went to Israel, I ma de peace with
 God.  I got my answer, my own ans wer.  I know 
the world would never allow Israel to come in existence if not six million martyrs on their part .  

Oh, yeah, I have guilt too.  It was a very, very 
deep guilt that I™m alive while the others didn™t 
survive.  I don™t know why.  Some how I always
 knew.  I know in my head, I didn™t do nothing 
to be here and I was just lucky.  But this gui
lt was persisting and the only way to press this was 
to talk the way I promised them. And I thi
nk I did. Although people 
said we are opportunists 
and liked to be pitied and so on. It wa sn™t  so. 
 I t was just sheer_________ 
frustration that they 
didn™t want to hear it. 
 

 I had beautiful comr ades, had beautiful experi
ences with them.  I had friends who find their 
own potato and gave me  half of it, when ther
e was no food. The same  token, I steal for them 
and I was beaten.  Borach but it didn™t  ma tter. 
We  cried at night when nobody else saw us.You 
could be sure the other person turned ar
ound and said don™t cry and started to tell you 
some thing with a funny and you laughed. We  tried to
 give each other a spirit to go on. When 
there was no hope, we created. You know you lie 
with the optimis m, nevertheless you try.  I 

had horrors, I saw unbelievable horrors.  I saw ba
bies being killed in fire when they weren™t 
completely dead yet.  I saw dogs tearing woma n™
s breasts.  I saw fighting like cats and dogs for 
a piece of breadcrumb.  I liced (? ), oh boy do I lice
. When I was filled with boils and our feet 
hurted and still you could laugh.  Still you recited 
poetry.  St ill there was a woma n who talked 

about Shakespeare there and the other one who went to the Bible, wit
hout the book, only in her 
head. There were girls who for eleven months di
dn™t eat a piece of crappy
 meat what they gave, 
wouldn™t eat it and kept the religion as it should be 
kept with the laws.  I learned that it™s  easy to 
be nasty --- by the same  token light up; the worl
d lights up wi th a good word.  I learn that it™s 

easy to say bad things to the other in anger. 
 I learned to say the good 
things which make the 
world a nicer place.  (End of Side B,Ta pe 1) 
 But in your heart when you talk 
all the atrocities, all the horro
r, all the pain, the hunger, the 
thirst , the humiliation, the hurt, the worry about your relatives, the pain what is unbearable 

when you see your friend die next to you, the lice 
bites, the fe ver without aspirin, without water, 

itchi ng, filth.  I saw in Krakow Plaszow I a hospital when a ba by is born and one of the SS 
came in and tear it apart.  I saw a girl, after he
r mother was beaten, ran to the German a nd held 
his uniform and yelled, don™t you have a mother?   Bo
th of them were killed just for holding on 
to his uniform. They talking about resistance.  
How could you resist when absolute indifference 
surround you?   Not to talk about 
those people really hated you; 
but the rest, the good --- the nice 
people who just didn™t  care.  It didn™t hit them
, didn™t happen to them. There were many people 
with us but it wasn™t  the same . Whe n you are 
alone, completely alone in the world, and you are 
surrounded by hate, you become  ti mid. The resist
ance just --- there was 
resistance --- just to 
stay alive wa s a form of resistance. When you reci
ted poetry, that was a for m of resistance.  But 
still --- with all thes
e odds, you are still human, that was a form of resistance. When you 

walked in the snow barefooted because the wooden shoes, the Holland type of woode n shoes 

which everybody got the same  size, didn™t fit on y
our feet and you had to run and rush or else 
you would be punished. You walked barefoot an
d still you could laugh and look at their eyes 

and keep your head up and say, I mi ght be lo
wer than you but I™m just as huma n being and 
ma ybe much better than you are. 
 

 There were ma ny, as I started to say, ma ny 
peopl e who were not Jewish also in camps .  
American prisoners and Russian prisoners and 
Polish prisoners-of-war; they had it a little 
easier, a little better.  It wasn™t  that absolute
 aloneness, the nothingne
ss behind it.  It wasn™t  
necessarily their family worried, where is their mo
ther, where is their father, were they killed 
and why?  It wasn™t  a hate surrounding -- the 
neighbors spit on you and so on. There were 
Christian wives or husbands who went into the ca
mp deliberately and I definitely take off my 
hat to them. They were just in the same  boat aswe were. They were our comr ades even if they 

weren™t Jews, they were my sist
ers, my blood brothers and I give
 them credit.  I don™t have any 
notes, I™m doing this just on the spur of the mo
ment and if I™m jumping here and there you™ll 
have to excuse me. 
 

 I want to talk about after liberat
ion a little bit to finish
 my story. After I was out of the hospital, 
I went to the United Nations RestitutionAction, 
I think that means UNRA 
camp. We were there 
from May to September, I got home, back to 
Hungary.  During that time, I personally again 
could only talk about my experience.  
Where I found friends,___________ who took me  out 
from Muenicle to Dachau where he was worki
ng in theAmerican kitchen and saved my life by 
giving me  food and shelter.  In
 there, there was a time  of 
my life when I didn™t belong to 
anybody.  I didn™t had to be account for anything
, perfect absolute freedom.  I done what I 
pleased, I went wherever I went. I know that we
 either  go to Palestine ther e when the Haganah 
people came up for us.  Our group decided to go
 first to Hungary to see if ma ybe some body 
alive.  Fr om that time, I would have gone to Is
rael.  Probably would never be in here, meet my 
husband, so who knows what was right, who know
s what was wrong. Anyhow I didn™t, I went 
back to Hungary.  Meanwhile let™s go back to the UN ca mp. 
 

 We  got food, we got shelter,
 we got clothes. There was 
no worry where the food was comi ng 
from. The most important thi
ng still was food to your stomach and that was done.There was a 
relative fr eedom in it.  Being in jail, everythi ng 
was beautiful .  Being in jail and out of jail, it 
was everything beautiful. The young friends and all th
ese.  I again recited 
poetry.  I lived with 
my so-called new fa mily. We  were responsible onl
y for teach other, to each other.  I was well 
liked.  I went to camp to camp to recite poetry.
  I was in theAmerican entertai nment committee 
which meant that  they took us to all thes
e UNRA  camps. I me t ma ny people, of course, 
whenever we meet, we always ask, you was with
 Hatvan? The people from Hatvan?   Or did you 
meet people from Satoralia,Whely, Erdoebene
? Where I -- my grandparents came and so on.  

You recuperated slowly. You had no outside 
contact with anybody be
side your friends and 
beside your fellow liberated inma tes. Then in Se
ptember, we were taken back to Hungary; also 
again of course, in freight train but in much better condition, 
with food, with shelter, with 
everything.  One of my friend who was two da
ys before me , c a me  home , c a me  back to 
Hungary; waited the Hungarian bord
er and told me  that my father is waiting for me  a t  the 
station. We l l , when I saw hi m, I thought he will
 die.  He was skinny
, he was ragged. He was 
liberated January and after January 
every single train he waited till 
he heard that I™m alive.  He 
waited after that every single trai
n again until I came  home and it left a toll on him. Then I 
became sick, I had again a pleurisy and I was take n to the mountain, my grandparent™s house.  I 
met Ernie, fell in love, we got married and we ha
d a plan to go to Israel.  We  went into a 
Hachshara, a aliyah camp and I became  pregnant
. There was no transports going to Pa lestine 
because most of the transports were caught in an
d was taken to Cyprus so we decided to get in 
touch with my uncle in France.  He gave us work
ing papers so we will be able to leave legally 
Hungary.  I had no bad time  after the war in Hunga
ry but I never went home  to Hatvan.  I just 
couldn™t bear the thought to go to Hatvan.  I fe
lt if I go near my house and I see something of 
my mother laying some where, I will run amok.  So
 Hatvan was no more in my eyes.  I had a 
baby, a preemi e baby. We  tried to keep her aliv
e for two months and then she died. Then we 

left to France. We  lived in Lyon for two years.  Put in legal paper for eitherAmerica or 

Palestine, to go to Palestine.  My fa ther, m
eanwhile, was already inAmerica and family meant 
an awful lot to me .  I knew that I have a lot of
 family here.  So the paper came  through and we 
did came toAmerica. 
 

 We  started anew and started from way bottom.
  Nobody helped us, thank God. Whatever we 
ma de, it was my husband™s two hands.  He starte
d right away a little 
shop in the neighborhood 
and went to work. Then I became pregnant w
ith my Kathy which was my  happiest mo ment in 
my life because after the first baby I had to wa
it for four years till I was allowed to become  
pregnant.  I had doubts that I coul
d be pregnant anymore. We  struggled and ma de a life and I 
was very happy.  I am happy.  I have three beautif
ul daughters.  Ernie --- Ernest ---and I raised 
them the best of our knowledge, the best to our ab
ility. There are time s when I couldn™t  console 
them as maybe other mothers could because their 
problem or their cry was so ridiculous to me 
after I went through, that I couldn™t feel sorr
y for some thing childish like not getting the good 
dress or what she wanted.  I can™t  tolerate self
- pity as I said before, on me , or on anybody.  I 
tried my bes t  with my children.  I ma de ma ny mi
stakes, of cour se.  But all the mi stakes was 
honest mi stakes, not being -- that™s one thing to
 hurt them.  I love them mor e  ma ybe than 
anybody else loved their child because to me it means a little more to have a family than 

some body who gets it easy, got it easy.  I love very 
deeply.  I try to be tole
rant to other people.  
Well, this is my story.  I 
hope that little bit we learn from each --- from some body else™s 
experience and it shouldn™t happen again.  Not to me , not to the Jews, not to colored ma n, a 

black ma n, or a yellow ma n, or a Christian, or aVi etname se, or anybody. 
 

 I love this country.  It gave me  shelter.  I™m 
full and equal citizen. I have a vote.  I came with 
nothing to this country and I bui
lt up a nice life.  
I like theAmerican people who mi ght be a 
little more naïve than the European but they are 
beautiful, they are helpfu
l.  I love the youth of 
America who cares forVi etnam and the black people
.  I love Israel.  I 
think it™s only existing 
because si x million died for it and people workin
g for it.  I™m no Hungarian any more.  I am 
American and I am a Jew.  It is beautiful to 
me  to look out the window when it™s  raining and I 

know that I have a shelter over my head and I ha
ve clothes to keep me  wa rm.The s mile of my 
children.  I gr ew up a lot in elev
en months and it alwa
ys will be with me .  I™m far from my 
friends. We  were thrown all over the world. Th
ey got ma rried and I got ma rried.  I don™t know 

their ma rried name  and they don™t know mi ne, or 
so few who does.  I met fellow camp people.  
We  ever me et, it™s like big family. Whenever
 I meet anybody with the same tattoo on their had 
as mi ne, they are close to me  even if I w
ouldn™t know their name , closer to me  than anybody 
else could be. We  ca me  to this country w
ith nothing. We  brought out my father-in-law and 
mother-in-law.Then we helped out my sister
-in-law and brother- in-law. We  took out my 
Hungarian --- my sister-in-law is still in Hungary
 for twice to visit and my  niece.  Once we 
went back to Hungary and the first time  I went
 back to Hatvan, my little town.  I found nobody, 
but nobody there. There was not one
 Jew left in Hatvan.  I™m 
not looking forward to go again 
to Hungary although I pr obably will, maybe this
 summer to see my niece getting married.  I 
don™t blame the people who completely assimila
ted over there, became Hungarianized. That 
much that they changed their name  and becamenon-Jews or nothing, no 
religion or  no nothing.  
They want just to be left al
one, not to be remi nded, not to be
 anything. They couldn™t left 
Hungary so they have to live their 
life the way they can..  I try to liv
e my life the way I see it fit.  
I don™t think I could try to understand those peop
le who are here and don™t want to reme mber 
being Jews. They just want to be completely as
si milated.  I hope the world will let them forget 
everythi ng but I doubt.As long as there is anti
-Jewish joke or anti-Semitism open or quiet, I 
fight against it.  I be long to B™nai Brith --- I st
arted to belong when I came  here and heard the 
first time  about it when I didn™t know the languag
e yet. TheAnti-Defamation League because I 
know what it could happen.  But as long as I™m here and not in Israel, I 
am very thankful for 
this country what they done for me  personally. 
 I have deep wounds but 
now it starts to heal.  
Now that people are asking questions and it won™t be 
forgotten. The libraries are full with each 
and everyone indivi dual stories and it will become
 more and more I™m sure. You could go there 
and pick it out. The books are not burned anymore.  Even in Skokie, even the neo-Na zis could 

yell again.  Maybe somebody will know that they are 
not just  idiots but th ey are threats and if 
we are standing together and figh
ting back now, then there won™t be anotherAuschwitz, which I 
know definitely. We  have a country now and our 
head high up.  I think it™s another story now 
but the awareness, we are aware what  could ha
ppen, will help that it shouldn™t happen again.  
The Hungarian Jews had one year, the Polish Jews
 had four, the German Jews had six or eight 
year of terror.  I know that as
 long as I live, theAmerican 
Jews, they™re not going to there 
because we are citizens.  If wors
t come s to worst, I™ll just  pack up and go to Israel be ca use ther e 
is a country where the Jews live in
 their own field, in their own 
country and they fight and they 
are surrounded withArab, enemies but they ha
ve a gun in their hand and it can™t happen 
anymore. If I would have a gun in my hand, it wouldn™t happen anymore. 
 

 Today™s my mother ™s  birthday. This is 1978.  
She was 38 years old and I bought all the lilac in 
the ghetto because I coul dn™t go out to buy her a car
d. A card, a little pres
ent so I stole all the 
lilacs and I gave it to her. Toda
y I™m giving in her me mory, this da
y.  I wish my father would be 
alive to hear it and to know how
 mu ch I loved him, how much I 
appreciated the way he raised 
me . What a n honor and a pleasure and what a ha
ppiness God gave me  that he was alive and I 
know hi m for thirty more years, 34 more years.  
He died --™44 -- no thirty
 years, exactly thirty 
more years with him. At least he saw my childre n.  He loved them and they loved him. This is 

my story.  Had to be told and I™m glad I said 
it and God bless you all.  I 
am very, very happy.  I 
could tell you when I™m around that it
 was worth it --- 
to be alive.
