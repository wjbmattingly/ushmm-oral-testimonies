STEVEN FENVES 
 March 25, 2005 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Steven. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: Welcome . 

A: Thank you. 

Q: Tell me  what your name  was at birth. 

A: St -- Steven Joseph Fe nves -- Fenyves. 

Q: Fenyves -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- you say actually. 

A: Right. 
Q: And wha  -- how do you pronounce it now?  Just Fenves? 
A: Yes, when I got my citizenship I -- I dropped 
it, th-the J, because the -- the Croatian spelling 
is with a J rather than the Y. 

Q: Right. 

A: And nobody could pronounce it so
 I -- I just dropped it. 

Q: Right. And what was it -- wh
at was your date of birth? 
A: June sixth, 1931. 

Q: And whe r e? 

A: In Subotica, then part -- then Yugoslavia, now it™s part of Serbia. 

Q: And then in the mi ddle it became part of some thing else, right, yeah.

A: Well, before World War 
1
, it was Hungary; 12 years before my birth it became  Yugoslavia 
and during the war it was re-occupied by Hungary. 
Q: Let™s get a sense of your fa m
ily a little bit. You have a mo ther, father and a sister, yes? 
A: Right. 

Q: Let™s talk about
 your dad first. 
A: Okay. 

Q: What was his name? 

A: He was born Louis Friedman. He and his br
other changed their name . That was the great 
vogue in Hungary that everybody was taking on Hungari
an name s, so they changed their name  to 
Fenyves. 

Q: Huh. And he was born in? 

A: He was born in Mako. 

Q: Right. 
A: In southern Hungary. 
Q: And wha t  was he doing for a living? 

A: Well, let me say a little bit on my fa mily histor y? 

Q: Sure. 

A: His older brother Ferenc, ev
en in high school, became very mu
ch in-involved with literature 
and journalism. Went to the University of Buda
pest to get a degree in law, although there is 
some claims  that he never got his law degree,
 which doesn™t surprise me because he -- his 

interest was in -- in jour nalism. He came back to 
Subotica and at some very early age, still in hi s 
20™s, became editor of a newspaper. My father, as 
soon as he finished high school went to work 
for a lumber mill in what is now Croatia, to suppo
rt his br other. My uncle married very well. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
3 
 
married a woman from Temesvar, now Ti mi soara. 
The daughter of a very well-to-do porcelain 
ma nufacturer. And I suspect with hi -- with 
her dowry, my uncle bought
 the newspaper -- the 
printing plant. And he was the editor, my fath
er was the ma nager. My uncle died in 1935, and 
then my father became the editor and my aunt became the manager. 
Q: And did your father actually have an in
terest in journalism too?  He mu st have. 
A: He had an interest in journa
lism;  he was not a journalist. I™m 
sure th-there is a -- a booklet 
that came  out in 90 -- 1994, there was a comme m oration of the 50
th
 anniversary of -- of the 
deportation, and there was a booklet 
about Jews in Subotica, and it 
talks at length about my uncle 
and then a short paragraph that
 after his brothe r™s death, L
ouis Fenyves became nomi nally the 
editor, but most of the editing was done by x and y. 

Q: I see. 

A: So yeah, he was not a journalist, my dad. 

Q: So you think he was more of
 an admi nistrator than -- 
A: He was a -- yeah, right. 

Q: -- than he was. 

A: Right. 

Q: And -- whereas your uncle 
was really a journalist? 
A: Right, right. 

Q: I see. Wh at kind of a person was your father
 in your me mory of him a s  a kid?  We re you 
close? 

A: Yes, we were close. The printing plant wa
s in the same  building where y -- where th -- 
Q: Where you lived? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
4 
 
A: -- where we lived. We had a two story buildin
g. My uncle™s apartment on -- on the first floor, 
ours on the second floor editorial offices, busines
s office and then a big plant. So we were 
always very deeply involved with the plant, a
nd I -- as a child I couldn™
t go to sleep unless I 
heard the presses rolling. 
Q: And why  was that, it wa-was it -- 

A: I mean, that -- that  -- that was the -- 

Q: -- it -- you don™t -- that was just -- 

A: -- that was -- uh-huh, the norma l way of things. 
So I -- I would visit my father™s office and 
yeah, we -- we spent time together, but -- we 
-- I -- my friends and I would -- did a lot of 
roaming around the plant -- plant, we liked to do that. 

Q: Wa s your father a serious guy, was he a -- 
a sort of a lighter person?  Do you -- do you 
recollect as a kid? 

A: Ah -- yeah, he was a serious guy, he -- he 
would -- enjoyed helping his workers. Several 
people started small businesses. One of them 
started a small machine shop where during the 
occupation I actually worked. So he was very help
ful to -- to -- who -- very
 involved in the lives 
of the -- his employees. 

Q: Uh-huh. And his brother 
Ferenc, was he older? 
A: He was, yes, three or four years older. 

Q: Three or four years older, and did 
he -- wh-what did he die of, do you know? 
A: Heart attack. 

Q: He had a heart attack. Do you have any reco
llection?  You would have been four years -- 
A: Oh yes, I -- 

Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
5 
 
A: -- yeah, my -- my cousin says it™s impossible,
 but I -- but it -- comi ng home from nursery 
school, had to get -- go up the stairs and in the 
landing was the door to their apartment and my 
uncle was there, waiting to be admitted. He ne
ver carried a key, he rapped on the frosted glass 
window to be let in by the ma id. And I always tim
ed that -- that I would get in there the same 
time, and we all -- he always ha
d jokes for me  [indecipherable] 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you liked him a lot, you can tell. 

A: Oh yes, yes, yes. 

Q: Wa s your father like him, or we
re they very -- quite different? 
A: I think my father was like him, he  -- yeah, 
he -- yeah, enjoyed, yeah. He certainly enjoyed 
life, I -- I reme mber after school
 -- after the paper was put -- 
put to bed, he would go to the 
coffee house and -- and have coffee with his frien
ds and I would go and -- and sit on his lap, and 
-- 

Q: Really, yes. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And tell me about your mother. Wa-was there -- 
they were similar in age, or was he consi -- 

older, or -- 

A: My father was born in 1889, my mother wa
s born in 1997. So there wa s eight years age 
difference. 

Q: You me  -- 1897. 

A: 1897. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
6 
 
A: And she was born in
 -- in 18 -- in -- 
Q: Cause you said 1997. 
A: Oh. 18 -- I™m sorry. 

Q: Yes. 

A: 1897. 

Q: Right. 

A: And she was born in -- I™m sorry. He wa
s born in 1887, she was born in 19 -- in 1899. 
Q: 1899, uh-huh. 

A: She was a -- I think she was sort of a withdr
awn person in a way. She -- she came  from a -- a 

much more prominent family than my father. My
 fathers -- was -- my -- my grandfather started 
out as a tanner in -- in this small shtetl in
 Mako, then moved t o Subotica and -- and a lumber 
dealership. And s -- I think both my 
uncle and my father ma rried up. 
Q: Up. 
A: My -- my  mother™s family father was a lawy
er. The first Jewish professor at the high school 
was a relative, couple univers -- professors at th
e University of Budapest
 were relatives. My 
grandmother™s family wa s Taussig. He  was one of
 the more -- her father wa s one of the more 
prominent merchants. And the -- so my mother 
was raised in a much more upper class family. 
She finished high school in Subard -- in what 
was then Subard, to coin the Hungarian name . 
Went to Budapest, got her degree in -- in grap
hi c -- graphi c arts, and came back to Subotica. My 
understanding is that she did some  artwork for my
 father™s newspaper and that™s how they me t. 
My understanding is that the family was opposed to
 the ma rriage and they sent her off on a grand 
tour, and the few pieces of -- of her work that we
 have is mostly ‚25 - ‚26 - ‚27, Vienna, Italy, 
France. But then they got ma rried. She did not c
ontinue her art as -- work as seriously as my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
7 
 
sister and I think she should have. Her studio wa
s shared wi-wit-with -- our playroom was her 
studio. She -- she, especially when my aunt b
ecame  the ma na ger of the printing plant, for all 
practical purposes, my mother 
was her social secretary.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Her coffe e -- my aunt™s coffee was at our house, hosted by my mother. 

Q: I see -- 

A: So -- 

Q: So it changed -- 

A: Yeah, so it -- it -- it was a -- 
strange relation -- I mean, all the 
important gifts, my fi rst watch, 
my first bicycle, etcetera, came from
 my aunt, not from my pa rents. 
Q: That™s interesting.  

A: But my mother was a very, very warm person. 

Q: But you said she was withdrawn in some  [indecipherable] 
A: She -- yeah, she -- she had a close set of fr
iends, but -- but she wa -- I wouldn™t call her 
outgoing at all. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. And what was her name ?  

A: Claire Gered. 

Q: That™s Gered -- g -- g- e-r -- 

A: G-e-r-e-d. 

Q: -- e-d. Uh-huh. You know, I forgot to ask yo
u, what was the name  of the newspaper? 
A: The name of the newspaper is Naplo, which means daily. 

Q: Right. 

A: The name of the -- of the plant was Minerva. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
8 
 
Q: Uh-huh. Now, what -- was it unusual for a woma n -- and I know you wouldn™t know this as a 
kid, but as you grew up an adult, to go and get 
as much edu -- education as your mother did? 
A: No, I don™t think so. I don™t thi
nk so. Several of the -- my aunt
s, several of the woma n I knew 
-- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- had -- had uni
versity degrees. 
Q: Do you think your mother felt bad because sh
e was not continuing he r art?  Do you think -- 
you don™t -- you have no idea. 

A: I don™t know, I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: She certainly encour aged th
e two of us to
 -- to do art. 
Q: To do it. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Did she teach you? 
A: She coached, she -- yeah sh-she superv
ised and she didn™t explicitly teach us. 
Q: Right. 

A: But she certainly encouraged us. 

Q: That™s interesting because you 
were in the same room with 
her, so I imagine i mitation -- 
A: Oh yes, definitely -- 

Q: -- was some thing that you wanted to do. 

A: -- definitely, right, yeah. 

Q: Right?  

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
9 
 
Q: And tell me  a
bout your sister. 
A: My sister is two 
years older than I. 
Q: And her name. 

A: Ear -- her name  is Esther, and she still uses th
e Hungarian wording of Eszti rather then Esther, 

with the Hungarian spelling of 
s-z. She was always a very ou
tgoing, very precocious, very 
headstrong girl. The few pictures 
that we have, always are red ha
ir, and very long plaits. She -- a 
-- during the Hungarian occupation she didn™t get in
to high school, so her education was sort of 

stopped at sixth grade, although in Paris she at
tended the Sorbonne. She™s very knowledgeable, 

very, very bright person. We  -- we [indeciphe
rable] reconnected after the war, we left 
Yugoslavia together, were in Fran
ce together, came  to the States
 together. And for the last 20 - 
some  years she has been living in Wa shington. 

Q: She™s been living in Washington? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Uh-huh. So that must be very nice for you, living nearby. 
A: Oh yes, yeah, yes. 

Q: Yes. And as children, she 
was a couple of years older -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- were you close, 
or was this be -- 
A: Oh yeah, we were quite close, we -- we ha
d -- I mean our life was governed by our governess. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so we were always together. We were
 both -- you can tell from our  age, depression 
children. Most of -- mos t  of our friends were sing
le children, or one or two children, particularly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
10 
 
many of her -- her classmates were -- were s -- on
ly children. And one of 
the things I didn™t care 
for is that I was dragged through all the birthday 
parties of her -- of he
r girlfriends. Which -- 
Q: You didn™t like that? 
A: I didn™t like that at all. 

Q: Wa s she dragged through the 
birthday parties of your -- 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: -- your friends?  No? 

A: No. 

Q: Only you? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: So tell me , you had a governess a
nd -- throughout your childhood, until -- 
A: Til the -- the -- the 
day of the occupation. 
Q: The day of the occupation. Wa s -- w-would you ha
ve considered your fa mily mi ddle class, or 
more than that? 

A: We ll, cook, ma id, governess, chauffeur. 

Q: That seems like a lot. 

A: But you have to recognize that Yugoslavia wa
s a det -- dirt poor country, and if you could 
afford to buy a car, you could certainly afford to
 build a second story on top of the garage and 
support one more fa -- one additional family. 

Q: I see. 

A: That™s how it worked. Our -- the governess 
was an important thing. My parents generation 
was totally saturated with German culture. A
nd the town had a large number of -- of ethnic 
Germans, Swabians. So -- so as not to learn that
 ugly street dialect, you 
had to have a governess 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
11 
 
to teach you Volksdeutsche. And yeah, governess was 
a large part of -- of 
the life of most of my 
-- most of my friends. 
Q: It was?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Was just typical in
 your [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, terrible woma n. 

Q: Yeah, I was going to ask you what
™s she like?  She was terrible? 
A: Aha, aha, cold, cold woman. Incredibly cold
 woman. Fanatically relig
ious, Catholic. Dragged 
us to churches and services all 
the time. The day -- the day they occu -- a-army came in, she left 
in a big show, and I thought that was the greatest thing. 

Q: That was the best thing. 

A: Yeah, right. 

Q: Did you complain to your mother and father about this woma n?  
A: Oh yeah, but that, I mean -- 
Q: Didn™t matter. 

A: No, no. 

Q: But it seems like an odd choice, given your de
scription of your parent
s, that they would 
choose someone who was quite like this. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: [indecipherable] you know. 

A: I mean -- I mean it™s -- it™s di -- I™m
 just trying to make a mental image. 
Q: So what did she -- 

A: I can™t think of any governess of any of
 my friends that wa
s a pleasant person. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
12 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. Now, I mean, that thought was going on 
while you were asking a 
question. No, I can™t. 
Q: You can™t think of any one? 

A: No. 

Q: So what -- what did she do for you?  I mean, wh
at di -- what was the -- what -- what did a 
governess do?  Cause I™ve never had one, I don™t know. 

A: We ll, first of all, in he
r presence we only spoke German. 
You know, the fact that I spoke 
Hungarian at home, Serbian in school, and Germa n
 with my governess, that -- that never s-
seemed to me strange un-until my children we
re all speaking one langua
ge. We ll, after school -- 
I think she would wait for us at 
sc-school, and we had to go on long wa -- take long walks. The -- 
one of the daily excitements of 
the city is that the Orient Ex
press changed engines. Hungarian 
engine was uncoupled, and th
e Yugoslav engine was -- 
Q: Really?  Uh-huh. 
A: -- coupled in. So that was a big 
event to go to, to the railroad st
ation to see the Orient Express. 
First time I saw a black person was -- was on that tr
ain. Then -- then we had another circuit for a 
longer trip, longer walk. 
Q: Wa s that -- let me  go back for a second, was 
that a big deal, that 
you saw a black person? 
A: Well no, no. 

Q: You just didn™t -- you just
 wouldn™t -- clearly you -- 
A: I -- it -- it --  

Q: -- it™s a long time me mory for you. 

A: -- right, right, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
13 
 
A: Long walks. So, you know, we were just in her presence much more so than in our par -- 
parents pr esence. 

Q: Did she smile?  I mean, did she have any -- 
she had no ni -- she apparently had no nice 

qualities as far as you™re concerned? 

A: No, she was not a nice person, no. 

Q: And Esther felt exactly the same  way? 

A: Oh yes, yes, yeah. And we were much closer
 to the -- to the cook and the ma ids. Maids never 
lasted very long, I don™t know why, 
but the cook wa-was the same  one for -- for years, for all 
that I reme mber. 

Q: Really? 

A: And we were close to her. 

Q: And did the ma id and the cook live in their 
own apartments and the go
verness lived with you? 
A: The governess lived with us. The apartment bu
ilding had sort of an 
extension and past the 
kitchen was -- was a two room apartment that the -- the maid and the cook shared. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The cook was ma rried and would take off so
me  nights. I think she had We dnesday afternoon 

off. But they had a -- a two bedroom apartment. 

Q: Right. And who cooked when she had time off?  Did your mother? 

A: My mother prepared -- da
 -- did a lot of planning, I don™t 
-- meal planning, I don™t know -- 
Q: Whethershe cooked. 

A: -- whether she cooked. One of -- 

Q: Go ahead. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
14 
 
A: -- one of the -- one of the few 
things that our cooked saved for us
 was, in addition to -- to the 
small portion of my mothe
r™s artwork was my mother
™s very thick recipe book. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Huh. Did you ever go in the kitchen? 

A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: So you were allowed to roam around the -- 

A: Oh yeah, yes. 

Q: And did you like -- you liked 
the cook and you liked the ma id?  
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Right. 

Q: Did you have an animal?  Any pets? 
A: My cousins downstairs had a -- had a co
cker spaniel, I -- I didn™t have one. 
Q: You didn™t have any? Did you like -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- did you like the cocker spaniel? 

A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. And then in the late 30™s, my oldest 
cousin, who was yu -- slated
 to take over the -- the 
company, de cided that he didn™t wa
nt that, that he wanted to 
be a gentlema n far mer. And my 
aunt, in her usual fashion, went 
out and bought a large farm, and c
onverted it to sort of a model 
far m. Brought -- mi  -- sent her son to -- to Zurich
, to [indecipherable] Federal Techni cal Institute 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
15 
 
to get a degree in agronomy. And she  brought back
 Swiss cows and a -- prize cows, and -- and I 
spent a good part of my s u mmers on the 
farm. So tha -- surrounded by animals. 
Q: Did the governess go with you? 
A: No. 

Q: No. She stayed home? She stayed in the house? 

A: Yeah. I don™t think my sister
 was there. I -- I liked to 
be on the farm, I enjoyed it. 
Q: You liked that? 

A: Yeah, right. 

Q: You liked the cows? 

A: Yes, we were herding the cows.  

Q: And they were do -- they we
re milking the cows, or -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- it wasn™t for slaughter? 
A: No, no. And there was a prize bull -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and I -- I exhibite
d him at -- at fairs. 
Q: Yes? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Huh. It didn™t -- it -- it was easy for you ta
lking these three language
s because you just -- 
A: Oh yes, yeah. 

Q: And were you s -- we re you speaking Serbian very well when you were in school? 

A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: So you were fluent? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
16 
 
A: Yeah. I reme mber after the war, after we re
turned from Auschwitz, a new -- a crop of teachers 
came, and I presumed school in -- in Serbian. 
And there was this literature teacher who came 
stormi ng in the -- in the room and handed out papers
 with terr ible grades 
on that. He said, ﬁNone 
of you think Serbian, you just all 
think Hungarian and then translate it into Serbian.ﬂ And we 
took that as a terrible affront, a 
terrible insult. I -- 
I felt that I was in good in Serbian as anything 
else. 
Q: As in -- right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Now, why were you speaking Hunga
rian to your parents rather 
than Se rbian or even German?  
Do you -- do you know why? 

A: They were part of the Hungarian Jewish culture. 

Q: I see. But still, German was very important to them. 

A: German was very important to them. 
Q: And th -- what -- they were fl
uent in German, I gather, as well. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yes. Tell me  about school, did you like school? 

A: At first I had -- I remember I had terrible 
sep -- separation anxietie
s in -- in kindergarten. 
They delegated me  to recite a poem about moth
erhood and I couldn™t get th
rough it, I broke into 
tears.  

Q: Oh. 

A: But after that, it was -- it was great, yeah. 
Again, Yugoslavia was a dirt poor country. It had 
compulsory education except it couldn™t afford
 it. So any organizati
on, religious community, 
etcetera, that could put up a building and hire 
three teachers, the government supplied the fourth 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
17 
 
teacher and it became a governme nt school. So they -- directly ac-cross the street from our 
house, in the -- in the courtyard 
of the -- of the synagogue was th
e Jewish grade school. I me an, 
it was a state school, but it was run by the Je
wish community. Probabl
y 80 percent of the 
students Jewish. 

Q: Jewish, mm-h m.  

A: And that™s where I went for firs
t four grades. I -- I liked it a lot. 
Q: You did. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: At -- so the neighborhood you lived in 
was primarily Jewish, or all Jewish? 
A: Jews -- we ll, again, Subotica had about 6000 Jews.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Divided, from what I understand, sort of equa
lly between one large Reform congregation, and 
mult -- multiple, multiple small shuls. The -- th
e Je wish community was very divide d. They -- 
those that immigrated -- that came from 
-- came  in the middle of the -- of the 19
th
 century, 
mostly from Arabia and Bohe mi a, n-now Czec
hoslovakia, where German speaking touched by 
the Mendelssohn [indecipherable] enlightme nt an
d belong to a Refor m congregation in ha -- 
hung -- Hungary had a three way split th -- 
Reform, which it was called neolog, and the 
Orthodox, and a third group that didn™t
 last very long called sinaqua 
al -- as before, that didn™t 
accept the separation. So there was this large Re
form congregation, a huge temple designed by 
my great uncle. I don™t like the 
word assimilated, I -- I think a
cculturated is a better term. The 
other half came  al most exclusively from acro
ss the mountains, from Galicia, touched by -- you 
know, influenced by Baal Shem Tov and Hassidism 
and there was very litt
le contact between the 
two communities.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
18 
 
Q: So even though the community is very small, it™s very divided. 
A: It™s very divided. The -- now, to ans -- l
ong answer to question, th
e Orthodox community was 
highly concentrated. The Refor m Jews lived all -- 
all over town, a
ll over the better parts of the 
town, so it wasn™t a Jewish neighborhood at all. 

Q: I see. W -- so, you had a mi xed bunc
h of friends, as did your sister? 

A: My school friends we re largely Jewish. 
Yeah, I had so -- some  neighborhood friends who 
were not Jewish, but most -- most of
 my friends were -- were Jewish. 
Q: And -- and Jews ma ke  up a tiny, tiny portion of
 the Yugoslav population, let alone it the area 
where you lived -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- right through -- 

A: Or the six percent in the town. 

Q: Right. So how were Jews treated within this c
ontext. Is -- di -- di -- we
re you raised feeling as 
if there were some anti-Semitism or not? 

A: Absolutely not, I didn™t -- 

Q: Absolutely not. 

A: -- that -- that existed. 

Q: Right. 

A: I mean, that all star
ted with the wa r in 1941. 
Q: Right. Now a-as you™re growing up, I mean y
ou™re very young when the Nazis take over, 
you™re only two years old in 1933. But before the wa
r, before ™39 and before ™41 when it really 
affects you strongly, do you hear about the Nazis?
 Do you hear your pare
nts talking about it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
19 
 
A: Oh yes, I -- I -- ye -- well, my mo ther™s brot
her emigrated to the States in the 1920™s. She -- 
she had a -- the ticket for the ma iden voyage of th
e Normandy in ™39 to visit her brother, to go to 
the World™s Fair. And she decided not to go be
cause the war ma de -- mi ght break out and she 
mi ght not be able to get back. 

Q: I see. Huh. 

A: So, yeah, lot of things I reme mber. I me  
-- one -- one thing I clearly reme mber, the radio 
ma king the announceme nt that the -- the [indecipher
able] the cardinal, whose name  just escapes 
me  was elected Pope Pius, and my fa ther sai
d, ﬁThat™s bad for the Jews.ﬂ I reme mber that. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. So we knew s -- 

Q: You knew s -- you knew some thing. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: We ™re going to have to stop the tape. 
A: Okay. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Okay, Steven, I have a few so
rt of disparate questions to as
k you. [tape break] Okay, Steven, I 
have a few different que
stions to ask you -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- that don™t necessarily all go together. Bu
t when you were talking 
about your governess, it 
was interesting to me  that she was a very Orthodox Catholic wo ma n -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- and here you are in a Jewish family. Di
d it bother you that you were going to the church? 
A: Mm, I -- I don™t recall at that time th
at it did, but -- no, I 
-- I don™t recall it. 
Q: No. And she wasn™t trying 
to impose her belief on you -- 
 A: No, no, no. 

Q: -- she was just clearly Catholic? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Huh. Did you like going to the church? 
A: No, not particularly. 
Particularly not kneeling. Kneeling in 
the church with -- with bare knees. 
Q: Ah, cause you were wearing shorts. 

A: Right, right. 

Q: Yes? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh, okay. And what about then, religion 
in your home ?  We re your parents religious, was 

-- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
21 
 
A: My parents weren™t particular religious. We  ob
served all the holidays, 
we didn™t keep kosher. 
We didn™t observe the Sabbath, except that my pa
ternal grandmother alwa
ys furnished a bowl of 
-- of cholent for the mi dday meal on Saturday. 
Q: And can you describe what cholent is? 

A: It™s a bean dish. The --  the traditional thing be
cause it can be -- be baked the day before and it 
doesn™t have -- require work to -- to ma ke it. 
The synagogue was across the 
-- the street from us. 
My maternal -- my mother™s uncle was -- was one 
of the two architects, so my father inherited 
his father-in- law™s seat di rectly behi nd the cantors in the fr  --  in the fr ont row and all I needed to 

was look up and my mother and grandmother and si
ster were sitting in 
the front row of the 
wome n™s balcony. 

Q: So this was an Orthodox? 

A: Well -- 

Q: Sort of.  
A: I was ultra-Reform, but still, me n wore hats, wo me n were on the second floor, service was 
entirely in Hebrew, except for one
 prayer for the king once a year. 
Q: And that was in Hungarian, or Serbian? 

A: Serbian. 

Q: Serbian. 

A: But -- but in comparison to -- to -- to th
e Orthodox, it was considered
 ultra-Reform. A ma in 
factor is that the synagogue
 had a -- had an organ. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Which is what -- what really
 set apart the two co mmunities. 
Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
22 
 
A: But on Yom Kippur -- I™m -- I mean Rosh Hash
anah, Yom Kippur, we went to the services 
then for Yithzcore, the children were chased out
 and we were running around the courtyard. But 
we participated in all the services. And af -- af
ter regular school, three afternoons a week, we had 
Jewish education. A -- a teacher who was a very 
strong Zionist, and we were taught not just 
Hebrew for the services, but we were taught th
e language spoken in Eretz Israel. And since 
school went on til noon on Saturday, after lunch on
 Saturday was a child
ren™s service in the 
small subsidiary chapel, which -- which was sort
 of a interesting even
t because a -- you know, 
there was no Kaddish itha -- a
nd -- and the [indecipherable] at
 which all hell broke loose, 
because at two o™clock the ma tinee started in 
the three cinema s and everybody was running at 
full speeds to get out of the serv
ice to get -- to get to the -- 
Q: To the matinee . 
A: To the matinee. So -- 

Q: And you were one of those kids -- 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: -- who went. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I didn™t ha ve to run as fast -- fast as the ot
he rs because I had passes 
to the -- to the paper™s 
press box, so I didn™t have to
 line up to get tickets. 
Q: Really -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- there was a press box? 

A: Yes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
23 
 
Q: Wow. So did you go every Saturday? 
A: Every Saturday. 

Q: No kidding? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And were these ma inly movies that were ma de in Yugoslavia -- 

A: No, no, no -- 

Q: -- or you show a lot of American movies? 

A: -- I™m -- lots of American movies. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And who did you like? 

A: I don™t reme mber, I -- we
 liked the cowboy movies. 
Q: I was going to say, that™s what I was -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, right, right, oh yeah, that™s right. 
Q: So did you see Hopalong Cassidy? 

A: I don™t reme mber -- 

Q: You don™t reme mber who it was. 

A: -- individuals, no, no. But I do reme mber, you know
, yeah -- subtitles, it wasn™t dubbed -- I 
don™t reme mber if it was dubbed or not. But certainly the publicity ma terial
 was in Serbian. And 
there was a movie ap-apparently when Technicolo
r was use, cowboys in color. And that was 
translated in Serbian as Kovboji ikoloru, in some place called color. 

Q: Right. 

A: So yeah, that was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
24 
 
Q: And were these double features, cause at that
 time  wi -- did see two movies or what -- 
A: I don™t reme mber, I don™t remember.  
Q: We re adults with you,
 or you all went alone? 
A: No, no, no, no, no. 

Q: You just went alone? 

A: We  went alone, yeah. 

Q: And who sat with you?  Did Esther 
go with you and sit 
in the press box? 
A: Ah -- well, well. Ah, yeah, and my older cousin
s, I mean, and e-each of us brought a friend or 
two. 

Q: Right. 

A: Or we took turns, I reme mber. 

Q: Now, the fact that you were not kosher, 
although you celebrated the holidays, you went to 
synagogue a lot, you got a lot of training, in a certain way. 
A: Oh yes, yes. Yes, definitely. 
Q: So you would have considered your childhood a 
-- you were in some  sense religious, clearly. 
A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: Definitely. 

Q: Another question. Did your mother™s fa
mily every approve of this ma rriage? 
A: My father never set foot in my grandmother™s house. 

Q: You™re kidding me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
25 
 
A: Yup. We  went -- my mother visited her mother
, I don™t know if it was 
once a week or twice a 
week, we met her there. I liked 
to go there because  her brot her was sending his mother old issues 
of ﬁLifeﬂ ma gazine. And I -- 
Q: You liked to read them? 

A: -- I could leaf through them. Th-TheDionne quintuplets and other news items -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- from ﬁ Lifeﬂ ma gaz i ne I reme mber. But very cold relationship. 

Q: Very cold. 

A: Very cold relationship. 

Q: Even -- even to you, as a child? 

A: No, no, no, not to me  -- 

Q: Not to you. 

A: -- just  to my father. 
Q: Just to your father. 
A: Just my father. 

Q: So that must have been very 
tough on your mo ther in some  ways. 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Very mu ch. 

Q: And do you think they refused to meet hi m?  I 
mean, they -- I mean, to do that for such a -- 
A: It -- it just -- two worlds. And whenever we
 went to Budapest, it was the same  thing. We -- 

my time was  shared between the opulent homes of
 my mother™s family on the hills above Buda, 
and the rather modest apartments where tw
o of my father™s sisters lived with -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
26 
 
Q: In Pest? 
A: -- with their family in Pest. 

Q: In Pest on the other side. 

A: Yup. 

Q: Uh-huh. Did that affect you and your sist
er?  Di d you feel that tension, or you don™t know? 
A: Oh, I felt that tension. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It came to a -- a head when my a unt took me  
-- took us to see ﬁWizard of Oz,ﬂ and I suddenly 
started screaming when they -- th
e bats appear, I wanted to ar 
-- I wanted to see my mother. 
Q: It™s scary, yes. 

A: I wanted see my mother, I 
-- I bolted out of the -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- the cinema  screami ng, and they had to take me
 back there to -- to Buda to -- so I could see 
my mother. 

Q: And how old were you the
n, five, six [indecipherable] 
A: Seven? 

Q: Seven. 

A: Well -- wa -- mi ght have been ™38 - ™39, so I was -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: --seven or  eight. 

Q: So everybody had to leave th
e theater who was with you -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
27 
 
Q: I guess, to take you there. And vacations, you 
took at various times during the year, or ma inly 
during the summer? 

A: Some at various times, most of them in the 
summer. My parents liked to go up in the Alps in 
what is now Slovenia and nearby was a camp that pr
ovided facilities for -- for children with thei r 

governesses. Are we -- I didn™t get to
 the shore -- to the Adriatic s
hore til after the war. We went 
to Belgrade a couple times. On the way to Belgra
de we -- Nowy Sad, we always stopped at the 
home  of the gentlema n who was the newspaper™
s representative, whose son is Joseph Lapid, 
for mer justice mi nister of -- of Israel, who we vi sit every time we -- we go to Israel. And then 

trips to Budapest, but exci
ting, it was a exciting place.  

Q: Now, you know wha t  I was thinking, given the 
relationship of your mother™s fami ly to your 
father, does this mean that when they got ma rri
ed there was no dowry, which would have been 

traditional, because they didn™t go to the wedding, I gather .  

A: Oh I presume they d -- I mu -- they must have, yeah, yeah -- 
Q: You think they must have? 
A: -- I -- they must have, yeah. I™m -- I -- I have no
 -- I mean it wasn™t really a break up of it all. 
Q: Right. 

A: It just a very, very cold relationship. 

Q: Cold relationship. Huh. Okay. 

A: I don™t kno -- I ne -- I don™t rememb
er either of grandfathers, they
 all died in their early 30™s. 
Q: I see. 

A: I don™t know if it was different when my gr
andfather was living, but 
my grandmother was -- 
was a -- 

Q: And did you see your paternal grandmother -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
28 
 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: -- your father™s mother a lot, as well? 

A: More often than -- yeah, yeah. 

Q: More often. 

A: We  -- w-we were seve n cousins and We dne
sday afternoons was the traditiona l day when 
ma ids and governesses had half day off. And wi 
-- my grandmother had a -- had a rather modest 
house, we were all parked there on Wednesday 
afternoons and we did te
rrible pranks, and -- 
Q: Yes? 

A: Yeah, my cousins we re really pranksters an
d -- and I as the youngest 
was always goaded into 
doing the worst of the things. 

Q: So like what did they do?  What™d you do? 

A: Like taking all of the years worth of pres
erves and soaking the labels off, and exch-
exchanging the label. Like -- like that. 
Q: And wha t  did your grandmother 
do, did she think this was funny? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: She did? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So she was a very good humored woma n. 

A: Oh very good, yeah. 

Q: Yes. So you liked being there, I guess? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Did you sp -- learn to speak Hebrew, 
as well as these ot
her three languages? 
A: No, ne -- I -- I -- I never did, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
29 
 
Q: No. 
A: I still read in the most halting way. 

Q: But you obviously can read some . 

A: Yes. 

Q: Because of that traini
ng that you had as a kid. 
A: Yes. 

Q: We ll, life changes fairly radically in 1941, or -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- doesn™t it -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- when the Germans attack Yugoslavia?  Wha t  is that like?  What do you reme mbe r  

[indecipherable] 

A: I don™t know whether school closed early or 
what -- but I was upstairs in the apartment and 
father came up. And we had this big radio console w
ith lots of dials and he was fiddling with the 
dials, and a German attack was announced, and 
Hungary was -- was joining, and on the way to 
re-occupy the for mer Hungarian provinces. And to a lo
t of people it was sort of a holiday at first. 
Q: A holiday? 

A: Yes, my uncle owned a bank and he took dow
n the -- the Serbian sign
 and behind it was the 
original Hungarian name  of the bank. And lot of
 people did that. And so
 the Hungarian army 
ma rched in. A s mall amount of resistance, a few poc
kets of -- of -- of gunfire. And on that day or 
the following day, a officer appeared in my fath
er™s office and ordered him out at gunpoint, and 
that -- 

Q: Hungarian officer did this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
30 
 
A: Yeah, and that was that, they -- the plant 
was confiscated, newspape
r taken over. A Aryan 
admi nistrator was appointed, who kept all the charges -- directed all the charges to my father and 
my -- my aunt™s personal accounts. 

Q: So -- 

A: And in weeks he -- he bleeded everything th
at the two fa mi lies ha d in ca sh. A third of the 
apartment was requisitioned for housing Hungarian 
officers. Cook, ma id, governess left the same  
day, even before the ordinance came that
 Jews were not allowe d to have -- 
Q: So they -- they left on their own, as far as you know? 

A: Yup. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So, a very intense shock. We  lucked out with
 the -- with -- with th
e quartering, because the 
three officers who were -- who were quartered in
 the house we re -- one was a -- one was a Count 
Esterhazy, one was a Count Karolyi, the son of
 the prime mi nister just before World War 
1
. The 
third one I don™t reme mber, but also a count
. Great gentleme n. Oh, 
we understand that 
Madame ™s cook has left, our servant ma n would 
-- whatever the -- the -- the orderly, is at 
Madame ™s disposal for whatever Madame  wishes. 
So it was -- was very tense. I used to have a 

large stamp collection, that was one of the ma ny thi
ngs that went with the 
-- the china and silver 
and crystals and every -- 

Q: They just took stuff? 

A: No, no, th -- that we had to sell. 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Ever -- everything we owned ha
d to sell. My mother did handi
crafts, knitting, weaving, to sell 
-- to pr oduce things that could be sold. My father
 became quite ill. The big event that summer, as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
31 
 
tha -- I had fi nished fourth grade so I was a-about
 to enter the fi  -- firs
t year of academic  high 
school. 
Q: Which isgymnasium?  

A: Gymnasium. And the Hungarian
 nume rus clausus law was put in
to effect, the number of Jews 
admitted equaled the number of -- the proportion 
of the Jews of the population. So eight -- it was 
decreed that eight Je ws would be admitted. And 
that summer, my father had nothing else to do, 
so he coached me  all summer in Hungarian li
terature and history, wh
ich I knew nothing about, 
which I had no exposure to. And so I took th
e exam. We re rough, very
 hostile questioning. I 
reme mber one, wh -- where did the Hungarian 
renaissance king defeat the Turks, the only 

successful battle against the Turks. And I knew 
the answer was Belgrade, but I knew that if I 
gave the Serbian pronunciation, that would be 
curtains. I didn™t know the Hungarian prun -- 
pronunciation. Then I reme mbered that Belgrade
 means white castle and Feher Var is white 
castle in Hungarian, that was 
the -- the Hungarian name . And then I knew -- I reme mber enough 
of my gra mma r that the declension o-of Var is 
irregular. And to say at Belgrade, you had to say 
Feher Var otage and not Feher Var ohn. And 
I said that, and the guy said fine. And -- 
Q: And you passed. 

A: And eventually I was one of the eight that  we
re -- were admitted. My sister  was not -- I don™t 
know if she didn™t take the exam or -- or wasn™t
 admitted, I don™t remember, but she went to a 
parochial school. The -- the -- this particular orde
r of nuns and a order of -- of teaching priests 
called the en -- the Pi arists, rel -- 
related to the Jesuits 
but not Jesuits. They refused to honor the 
nume rus clausus and they accepted Je wish students. So I went three years to the gymnasium. 

Hostile teachers sitting in the back row. 

Q: Jew -- the Jewish students had to sit in the back row? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
32 
 
A: Sit in the back row. If you 
raised your -- raised your hand th
ey ignored you, most of the time . 
A fren -- a father of a friend was -- a few years 
ago was doing a history of -- of that gymnasium, 
and I asked him to -- to look up the name s. And he 
gave me  the name s and he said, ﬁThere™s this 
strange notation. The tuition is 
-- tuition charge is listed.ﬂ So in -- you know, in addition to 
everything else they -- they char
ged tuition to the Jews in -- in 
nomi nally free public school. So -
- so it was -- 
Q: It was really tough for you, wasn™t it? 

A: So it was a very tough life. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Tough on m -- very tough on my pa
rents and to see that, it was 
very tough. I st -- in the 
afternoons after school and in summers, I starte
d working in this machine shop of a former 
employee that my father bankrolled into getti
ng this shop. He was the only mechanic who could 
repair the -- the printing presse
s, but he was a Serb, and so 
the Hungarians threw him out. And 
the presses never ran after that. And so I worked
 in his machine shop, and that -- and had some  
income , but -- but it was a very, very tenuous and 
tough life. And -- and my mo -- my father was 
getting -- was -- was physically i
ll, he -- he was in -- in th
e hospital in Szeged, uh-huh. I 
reme mber going to a temple, must have been Pa
ssover of -- of ™43 or 
™44, I don™t know, but my 
sister and I went to the temple and there was no 
place to go after that because my mot her was in 
Szeged with my father and a -- 
visiting him in the hospital. That was -- it was -- it was very 
harsh.  

Q: Do you know what sort of sickness he had? 

A: He -- he -- he had angina. 

Q: He had angina. And do you think he 
had this before, or that we -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
33 
 
A: I don™t know, I don™t know -- 
Q: -- the shock of what happened? 

A: -- but the -- I don™t know, but he 
is -- the stress on him was very -- 
Q: Wa s ha -- was very high. 

A: Was very high. 

Q: Now was there an early trial of
 your father over the business? 
A: Yes, yeah, the hung -- 

Q: What was that about? 

A: -- the hu -- the Hungarians had to 
legitimize all of these takeovers. 
Q: Right. 

A: And there was a trial of
 my aunt and my father. 
Q: Of your aunt as well? 

A: Oh yeah, well, she was the owner. My father was the ma nager. 
Q: Right.  
A: And a horrible -- the -- the people who had 
worked for my father -- you know, there™s 
horribl e, horrible anti-Semitic statements and ac
cusations and -- I -- I n 
-- I know that was ver -- 
very hard on his -- father. And the end of the 
trial was that the -- the takeover was just ified. 
Q: I see, so -- 

A: It was legally sanctioned.  

Q: -- so there was no additional puni
shme nt other than the taking -- 
A: No, there was no addition -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
34 
 
Q: But that still must have been horrible for your father. 
A: Oh yeah, well. Yeah, wa -- 

Q: It certainly affects you now when you think b
ack on it, doesn™t it?  Yeah. What was it like 
every day in your fa mily now that this -- was 
it very depressing, or
 scary, or -- or -- 
A: Depressed, I don™t know if it was depressing, but 
all scrunched together. I think at the end we 
only had the two rooms. 

Q: The what?  You -- 

A: Two rooms. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Sa -- two rooms in the -- yeah, on the back si
de were taken, the large dining room was taken 
and I think we were scrunched into
 two rooms. Yeah, it was v -- very
 tou -- very tense, is what I 
r e me mb e r .  

Q: And wha t  about friends?  Your non-Jewish 
friends stopped playing with you when you were -- 
A: Yeah, largely, although in -- in
 the high school, in -- in the 
gymnasium, there were a couple -- 
a couple of kids who were -- who were very d
ecent. I reme mber one -- one thing I reme mber 
clearly is that we had to go on a -- on a -- a nature
 hunt and collect mushrooms of a -- or plants or 
whatever. And these two guys came and asked if -- if
 I would join them and -- but at that -- that 

was sort of isolated in a -- oth-ot
herwise we were totally isolated. 

Q: And do you think that these people were -- be
cause you describe your life before as no anti-
Semitism, I mean Jews and Catholics and 
people are intermingling in Yugoslavia. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But the Germans come, and even in the [indecipherable] 

A: We ll, reme mber, from ™41 to forty f -- f -- forty phone -- four, there were no Germans. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
35 
 
Q: Right, there™s Hungarians. 
A: Hungarians. 

Q: Right. 

A: With there -- yeah. I think 
they -- they sanctioned anti-Sem
itism of the -- of the occupying 
forces let things -- encour aged
 things to boil on the surface. 
Q: But then it™s -- becomes -- it™s 
interesting as to what people r
eally believe. Do they really 
believe this, or are they just doing it b
ecause it™s sanctioned, and you know, there are 

[indecipherable] 

A: I don™t know, I don™t know, a -- a -- a lot of 
people became pardoned, me mbers of the Arrow 
Cross party, but by the time  I got back in ™45, they
 were wearing the insignia that they had been 
partisans since 1941, the same  people. 

Q: Right, sure, sure. Do you reme mb er anti-Semitic
 laws that the Hungarians put into place in 

™ 4 1?   
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: You do? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: And wha t  -- what were -- what do you reme mber?   

A: Oh, t-turning in everything. Turning in radi
os, turning in alarm clocks, I don™t know what 
else, but there was always a new law about -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- things you couldn™t do, which we laughed o
ff, because we couldn™t afford to do them 
anyhow. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494

A: And -- and these interminable laws
 about this had to be turned in  and that had to be turned in. 
And trooping to the -- to the police h
eadquarters to turn these things in. 
Q: And did you have to wear a Jewish star? 
A: Not until the -- 

Q: Or did that come  later? 

A: -- Germans came. 

Q: Not until the Germans came. What about m
ovies, could you go to the movies still? 
A: Movies were prohibited, the 
beach was prohibited. The beach, 
which was a big part of our 
summer events -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that was prohibited. There was a -- a steam ba
th with a sort of a small makeshift beach, that  
-- owned by a Jewish businessman, that sort of 
became the hanging out place in the summer. La -
- and movies were out. Beach was out. The pr
omenade up and down the ma in drag was out. 
Q: Wa s out. Were you able go to synagogue still, or not? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You could? 

A: Yes. 

Q: We re there raids in the synagogue, 
or were you -- you -- you were f -- 
A: No, not that I know. 

Q: Were -- were you fearing phys
ically during this period? 
A: Not that I recall. 

Q: No. 

A: I just felt -- things --

Q: Confining. 
A: Confining yes, but not 
-- not fearing, no, I didn™t.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Steve, did you notice that the treatment of Je ws
 and Serbs were sort of equally as bad during 
this period be fore the Germans come ? 
A: Yes, definitely. Yeah, very definitely. 

Q: So e -- so everybody is suffering under this, except -- 

A: Well, I™m -- at that time the Serbs were defi nitely the mi nority in Subotica. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Majority was certainly -- was Hungarian. But 
definitely two of the 
senior editors of the 
newspaper were Croats, they were 
let go at the same  ti me  as -- as my father and -- and the other 
Jewish employees. There were only thr
ee or four Jews I -- that  I recall. 
Q: Right. 

A: But they were let go and yea
h, there was a lot of discrimi na
tion against the Serbs. Pr obably 
more than the Croats, but -- 
Q: Now, is the paper running? 
A: The paper is running as some  -- 

Q: Still running. 

A: -- as some -- I forget  now the ti
tle, they change d the title it was -- 
Q: It wasn™t Naplo any mo
re, it was something else. 
A: No, yup, right. 

Q: Now whe n you go to bed do you still hear the whirring of the -- 

A: Yeah, n-not that mu -- 

Q: -- but it doesn™t mean the same  thing, does it? 

A: -- no, no, no, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
39 
 
Q: Now ho -- how are y -- is your mother the 
person who™s earning th
e mo ney, cause all the 
money is -- 
A: Largely yes, yes.  

Q: And she™s doing craft things? 

A: Craft, right, right. 

Q: Is she drawing at al
l and selling it or not? 
A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: One of my close friend™s father had a -- a r
ug factory. So he -- and -- 
and actually his oldest 
son was a -- was a textile engineer, and they c
ould -- they had the equipment to weave and dye 
wool. And the textile engineer 
ma de -- built some  hand looms and my mother and her friends 
were weaving scarves, Sc otch plaid s-scarves. Th
at was one of the things. Yeah, I me a n, that was 
sort of eking out a living.  
Q: So this was a unbelievable change for your 
mother, to be working in this way, right? 
A: Oh yes, yes, yes.  
Q: So she™s actually going to work every day? 

A: It was a cottage industry, I mean. 

Q: I see. So it was small. 

A: She was doing at home . 

Q: And she was doing it home . 

A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yup. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
40 
 
Q: And your father™s not working at all? 
A: Not that I recall, no. 

Q: Not for those three years. 

A: No. 

Q: And wha t ™s happening with your grandm
other, how does she survive? Your two 
grandmothers? 

A: They stayed in their apartments. I don™t reca
ll either of them ha
ving had quartered -- no, I 
don™t think they had. 

Q: Now, you were -- 1941, you™re 10 years old. 

A: Yes. 

Q: You™re still a kid, but nevertheless -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- you™re not living the 
life of a kid any more. Wa -- are you 
hearing things about the war, the 
start -- 

A: Oh yes, there were -- there were clande
stine radios, BBC n e ws came through. Opening bars 
of the fifth symphony still ring a bell. Th
at was the announcement of BBC Europe. 
Q: Really? 

A: So we pretty much knew what was going on. I 
think my friends and I had a ma p a nd we were 

doing -- ma ke -- putting pins. Hungary -- Hungary put an enormous number of s -- of soldiers on 

the -- on the Soviet front. Hungary lost more -- 
more men on the -- in th
e Battle of Stalingrad 
than the Germans did.  

Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
41 
 
A: So that -- that was known everywhere. Draftage Jewish boys were put into these notorious 
labor brigades, doing horrible 
work, including mi ne cleani
ng wa -- with their bodies. 
A: Right. 

Q: My mi ddle cousin died -- two of my cousins 
died in Hungarian labor camps. Hungarian la -- 
labor a -- brigades. So there were
 the news about those events. 
But -- yeah, we knew. We knew, 
but we couldn™t accept it. 

Q: Right. 

A: My oldest son -- cousin was c -- was stuck in
 Switzerland. Our mi ddle c
ousin -- the other two 
were in labor brigades. At sa -- for some  reas
on they were both home at the same  time. They 
went to see their mother and they said they 
were going to swim across 
the Danube at night and 
join the partisans. The partisan
s were already at the Danube. A
nd my -- my  aunt put her foot 
down and said, ﬁNo self respecting Jewish kid wi
ll swim across the Danube at night and join 
those people in the wood
s.ﬂ And that was it.  
Q: That was the end of that. 

A: That was the end of that, yeah. 

Q: You knew this at the time? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What did you think?  Why di -- did you think they should go? 

A: Oh, I thought they should go, yes. 

Q: They should go. 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
42 
 
A: Yeah. But that was -- you know, that was the 
attitude. I mean, yeah, it was unfathomable, 
unthinkable that this was going 
to happen, what™s go -- going on a
nd that anything would happen 
to them. 
Q: And did you begin to hear thi
ngs that were happening to Jews? 

A: Yes, we were beginning to 
hear about people who were -- 

Q: Killings? 

A: -- who were at -- snuck acro
ss the -- the border from the nort
h, from Poland, or occupied S-
Slovakia, and yes, even at my age I began to hear, yes. 

Q: So did you start getting scared? 

A: No, I think -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- I mean, my parents and -- assured me  that
 that -- that™s never going to happen to us. 
Q: I see. So life was hard, but it was 
not going to become  i mpossible to live. 
A: Yeah, I mean -- 

Q: It was not [indecipherable] 

A: -- that generation was so totally
 under the influence of -- of -- of
 German culture that they just 
couldn™t accept that. If there was a di vision be tween 
them and us, they -- they were part of -- of 
us, Germans  rather than them -- I mean, I me nti --
 I me ntioned to you this 
-- this story at the -- 
this ma gazine that was published in 90 s -- ™94 for a 50
th
 anniversary. The big section where my 
uncle and -- and -- and my father are described, 
the heading of that s
ection is Jews as the 
guardians of Hungarian culture
 during -- during the Yugoslav y
ears. That™s how they -- 
Q: That™s how they put it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
43 
 
A: -- they viewed themselves, and that™s how the 
world viewed them. And so they -- I mean, we 
heard about the -- the slaughter at Nowy Sad, but
 yeah, you do -- it couldn™t happen to us. That 
was my parents attitude.  
Q: Tell me  so me thing. When you d e sc
ribe listening to the BBC radio -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- you get extremely emotional. What -- what
 is it?  What -- what do you think it is? 
A: Well, fi rst of all it was illegal. 

Q: Illegal. 

A: And punishable by I don™t know what punishme nt.  

Q: Right. 

A: But it was such a break from everything else. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean, we listened to the German radio too, you know. 
Q: Right. 
A: And it -- the jokes going around was that before 
our children™s tales start -- started with once 
upon time, and now our [speaks foreign language
 here] high command of the German army 
announces that. And then the children say okay to follow. That was, yeah, one of the ongoing 

jokes. So they -- the BBC was a -- was a breath of fresh air. 

Q: Do -- do you think that your pare
nts ever thought of leaving? 
A: Not that I know of. 

Q: Or was it possible by then? 

A: By then it was impos sible. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
44 
 
A: When -- when you think about being in the ap
artment when you could only be in two rooms, 
is -- is there a kind of normalcy 
that gets created during that ti
me  in spite of what™s going on? 
A: Oh yeah, yes, definitely. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Definitely. 

Q: So you just -- one, as a human bei
ng, just keeps adjusting and adjusting? 
A: Oh, I -- right, oh yes, de -- very definitely. 

Q: Did you -- 

A: I think my sister  rebelled a lot more than 
-- I mean, my sister rebelled, I never rebelled.  
Q: And -- and how did she rebel? 

A: Oh, she wasn™t going to do this, she wasn™t 
going to do that, she wasn
™t going to wear -- obey 
this law, she wasn™t -- yeah. 

Q: So in 1941 she™s 13. 
A: Right.  
Q: So she™s enough older than you that she -- 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Does she actually disobey? 

A: Oh yeah, I think she did. 

Q: Or does she -- she did? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Did she ever get in trouble? 

A: Not that I know of. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
45 
 
A: No, no. 
Q: So she was good at it. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And once you noticed that she was doing it, di
d you think, well I think I™ll do that too, or did 
you decide no, you™re not going to do that. 

A: No, I -- 

Q: No, you didn™t. 

A: -- I -- no, no. 

Q: And how does your relationship with each 
of your parents?  Your father is ill. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And whe n he come s back from the hospital, is -- 

A: I mean -- I was trying to be as
 helpful and supportive as I could -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- helping him when he was ill,
 he lping my mother with all ki
nds of chores, whatever I could. 
Yeah, I me a n, I really tried to -- recall that I trie
d to be as -- as helpful and as unobtrusive as I 
could. 
Q: So what kind of a kid were you?  Do
 you -- how would you describe yourself?   
A: I was serious. I was always interested in arts, ev
en before the war, but af
 -- certainly after that . 
I was not physical at all, but I g -- had a lot of
 very good friends, and we did lot of things, and -- 
Q: So you didn™t do sports much?  

A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
46 
 
Q: Right. D-Do you remember hearing about some
thing called the great raid in 1942 in Backa?  
There was a lot of killing in Nowy Sad. 
A: In Nowy Sad, right. 

Q: In 1942. 

A: Right. 

Q: And did -- did you hear about that then? 

A: Yes, certainly. 

Q: You did? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And did you still think -- I mean, did you thin
k to your he -- you know, why are they telling 
me  this is not going to happen, it 
is happening. Or was this a -- 
A: We ll that was so egregious that even the H
ungarian army was forced to hold a court ma rtial 
for the general who ordered it. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And it just didn™t seem to be something 
that was going to repeat, or wa s repeatable. 
Q: Right, so it seemed uncommon, as oppo -- 

A: Right. 

Q: Exceptional for you. 

A: Yes. 

Q: I see. Okay. So you have three years wher
e ne -- nothing terribly me morable happens except 
life is -- 

A: Wa s -- was -- was getting squeezed together. 

Q: -- getting closer and squeezed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
47 
 
A: Yup. 
Q: Do you have relatives in other parts of Eu
rope that you™re not hearing from, or you are 

hearing from, do you reme mber? 

A: I™m -- tell you my aunt came from -- from this well-to-do -- 

Q: This is Fe renc™s wifes -- Ferenc™s wife, right? 

A: Ferenc™s wife. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The firm ha -- her brother, 
younger brother was the firm™s repres
entative in Berlin. In the 30™s 
he moved to Holland and was the firm™s representative in Holland. When Holland was occupied 

he was deported to Subotica. And why not to [indeci
pherable], Subotica, with his -- with his wife 
from Berlin and his two children. And we becam
e very close to -- to the -- her cousins. 
Otherwise I don™t know of much contact. We had 
some  relatives in Switzerland we had very 
little contact with. My cousin in Switzerland we 
had practically no -- I don
™t recall we had co -- 
much contact with him. No, we didn™
t have any contact that I think of. 
Q: Now wha t ™s the food situation, since you don™
t have much money. You still eating okay, as 
far as you reme mber? 

A: Yeah, yes, lot of potatoes, lot of boiled potatoes, I reme mber that. Yeah, I mean, I don™t -- 

Q: You don™t recall deprivation. 

A: I wouldn™t call it depravation -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- it was just a ve
ry constricted, and -- 
Q: And is your mother cooking? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
48 
 
Q: She is. And she -- is she okay as a cook? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Very good cook. 

Q: She was a good cook? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. Now, when we move to 1944, thi
ngs change in an even more radical -- 
A: Right, right. 

Q: -- way. In 1944, in March, Germany occupies -- 

A: Hungary. 

Q: Hungary. 

A: Right. 

Q: And since you™re be en -- this li
ttle piece is part of Hungary -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- what happened? 

A: We ll, o-order to wear the yellow star came firs
t, that came  a l most right away. Within days, I 
don™t recall the dates, but within 
days my father and most of the prominent Jewish me n were 
deported to a small village
 called Backa Topola.  
Q: So he is deported with other Jewish me n?  

A: Yes. No news at all. And again, I don™t reme
mber the date. By that time there was no school, 
and I was working full time  in this machine s
hop. Then came the summer
 and end of May, early 
June, I don™t reme mber the date, came the order to
 move into the -- this 
restricted area along the 
railroad tracks. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
49 
 
Q: In Subotica. 
A: In Subotica. 

Q: Can I stop you for a mome nt? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you reme mber when your father was taken away? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Wer -- were you there? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What was that like? 

A: We were all crying, we were 
all very upset. Very painful. 
Q: And who came?  Germans ca me  and took him?  

A: Hungarian. 

Q: Hungarians came.  
A: The entire -- even after the German occupatio
n, up to and including of 
loading into the -- into 
the railroad cars, I don™t re
me mber having seen a German. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yes. Wa s all done by Hungarian gendarmerie. 

Q: Hm. And there™s no warning that your father
 and these other me n are going to be taken? 
A: No. 

Q: They just come  and they grab them and take them. 

A: Right, right.  

Q: And he™s not a well ma n as it is. 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
50 
 
Q: Okay, so now you™re alone with
 your mother and your sister. 
A: Right. 
Q: And your mother™s still working or 
she™s not allowed to work any mor e . 
A: I -- it went so fast, I 
don™t know. I honestly don™t know. 
Q: Okay. 

A: But anyhow, the order came to 
move with possessions that you c
ould carry, into this row of 
dilapidated houses, along the trai -- 
trai -- railroad yard. One of the nastiest me mories I have is 
getting -- going on that journey, and people were 
lined up, up the stairs, up to the door of the 
apartment, waiting to ransack whatever we left be
hind, cursing at us, yelling at us, spitting at us 
as we left.  

Q: Did you know any of these people? 

A: Not that I reme mber. I don™t know. I don™t know. 

Q: But like vultures they were standi ng -- 
A: Like vultures, right. Except among them 
was  our cook. She went in, she grabbed the 
cookbook and she grabbed this folder of -- this binde
r, and shoved into it a
ll the artwork that she 
could shove into it. 
Q: And took it. That™s quite an act. 

A: Yup. And she gave it back to us when -- when 
we came back. So we went into this one room. 
My ma ternal grandmother was bithu -- was moved in with us. My paternal grandmother did 

something else. 

Q: Uh-huh, the ma ternal, okay. 

A: Yup. 

Q: The paternal grand -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
51 
 
A: My -- my  father™s oldest sister Rose ma rried 
a Christian, converted at such an early age that 
by Hungarian law she was not Jewish. By Ger man
 law she would have been. Not only she was 
not deported, but my grandmother moved in w
ith her. All of us were going one way -- 
Q: She was going -- 

A: -- and everybody knew that old Mrs. Friedman 
was living there for a y
ear with -- with her 
daughter, and nothing happened to her. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Huh.  

A: She was there when we came back. 

Q: How interesting.  

A: Yup. So -- 

Q: Did you see the cook? 
A: No, not -- no, I don™t -- no. 
Q: You didn™t see the cook at 
that mo -- you [indecipherable] 
A: No, I-I™ve thought about that before, no I -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: No. 

Q: It™s interesting what she took, isn™t it, St eve? 

A: Yup. 

Q: That she took your mother™s things, and no -- 
nothing else. It™s quite 
extraordinary, actually. 
A: It turns out, we discovered this just 
a few years ago, that within this thick cookbook, 
some how stuck into it, were two ot
her things. One was a blueprint of
 the parlor furniture that my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
52 
 
mother™s uncle, the architect de
signed for her as his wedding gift
. That™s fr amed in my  -- my 
sister™s apartment. And t he ot
her a slim diary that my mother had kept, which is sobering, 
because it™s two and a half
 years of my sister from her birth, 
and about four months of me a fter 
my birth. 
Q: Really? 

A: And then they -- 

Q: And then it stops? 

A: And then it stops. So -- 

Q: And it™s about you as a [indecipherable] 

A: Oh, yeah, yeah -- 

Q: -- it™s just every detail of what you -- 

A: -- like every detail, measurements, not just he
ight and weight, but the he -- circumference of 
the head and -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- and -- and food, and how mu
ch food and how much wei ght, yup. 
Q: That mus t  -- 

A: And first words and -- and everything. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s extraordinary to have, isn™t it? 

A: Yes, yes, yup. So -- so that™s where we wound up. 

Q: And wha t ™s this ghetto like? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
53 
 
A: We ll, it wasn™t a connected ghetto. It was se
veral areas dissected by major roads that were 
open. And, you know, broken down old houses that we
re requisitioned and we were squeezed 
into them. Terrible sanitary c
onditions, terrible. Some
 communal food, but that was terrible. No 
me dical attention whatsoever. But you™re still allo
wed to go from one to another. And I, working 
in a plant that was doing some military work, had a pass to get out of the --  the ghetto. 
Q: Is this in an -- it™s not en
closed, is there a fence, or -- 
A: There was some  kind of a gate, guarded by -- 

Q: There was? 

A: Yeah, it was enclosed at night.
 I -- but not -- not -- not as --  
Q: Not like a wall? 

A: -- not like the Warsaw
. Yeah, not a wall, no. 
Q: Did you have toilet facilities in your apartme nt?  No. 

A: A privy in the -- in the back. 
Q: In the back? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Wa ter?  

A: Like everybody else, y-y-yea
h. Artesian well in the back. 
Q: Wa s there a kitchen?  No kitchen. 

A: No. 

Q: No, so it™s all communal eating -- 

A: Yeah, right. 

Q: -- which is not eating. 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
54 
 
Q: So you -- do you start being hungry? 
A: No, I work outside. My boss™s wife fed me  lunc
h, and had a satchel for me  to take back to the 
fa mily. So I was probably better off than most 
people. But I was in the shop on my birthday, 
June six, 1944, and I her -- when we heard a
bout the -- when I hear
d about the -- about 
Nor mandy. And I must have been the first one to come
 into the ghetto to -- to
 tell people about it. 
I -- I don™t know, I -- it™s -- it™s 
-- when I recall I -- it
 was sort of a hothouse atmosphere. I mean, 
we had, at age 13 we had this -- this horribly 
serious love affairs wi
th 12 year old girls. 
Q: Really? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: You too? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. All -- I mean, everything was -- was very 
intense and very concentrated and very pres -- 
precocious for age, shall I say so. 

Q: So when you say affair, you mean there were -- there was a lot of sexual relations. 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Wa s this shocking for the adults?  Were they
 all like what™s going onhere, or did nobody care 
any more?  

A: Nobody cared any more. 

Q: Nobody cared. And did -- did it
 feel as if -- we ll, we ma y die, so -- or is -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely. And 
things can get only worse 
was -- I think that was 
the [indecipherable] yeah. 

Q: Right. So did you have
 a steady girlfriend? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
55 
 
A: Yes. I was more ena mored of her than she was of me , but -- 
Q: We ll, it happens, doesn™t it? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And did you bring her some  of th
e food that you™ve brought back? 
A: Oh yes, yes. But that only was -- that was 
-- a-again, I can go back to
 the -- this thick book by 
the gentleman fr om Columbia University. 

Q: Really? [i ndecipherable] 

A: No, no, no, no, they -- the gentlema n who di
d the two volume  on the genocide in Hungary. 
Q: Oh, Braham. 

A: Br -- br -- yeah, Braham. 

Q: Braham, yes.  

A: I mean, I can get a
ll the dates out of it. 
Q: Right.  
A: I was one of the ma in plain
tiffs in the -- in the slave labor
 suit, because I -- because I had 
better documentation than anybody else, because I ju
st went to Braham™s book and copied out all 
the dates. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So mi d-June were -- order came, leave the ap
artments with one piece of luggage. We™re lined 
up facing the railroad yards. We  wer e  put into th
ese railroad cars and that
 was just a very short 
trip to Bacsalma s which was a -- a village that
 Hungarians took over and 
made it as the ghetto 
for putting in people from Nowy Sad and the whole region. 

Q: And that became -- that™s the ghetto that ends 
-- ends up be ing a weigh station to other places. 
A: To -- right, right -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
56 
 
Q: Right. Cause you™re not ther
e for hugely long time, right? 
A: No, five, six days, I think, you know. 
Q: Is that all? 

A: I think so. 

Q: And who of your fa mily goes? It™s your 
sister and your mo ther and your ma ternal 
grandmother? 

A: My -- my  a -- ma ternal grandmother. My Un
cle [indecipherable], my a unt and her mother, 

and her sister-in-law, German speaking Gerda. 
That™s it. Now I™m told, I don™t reme mber that, 
but I™m told that the church bell
s were ringing and that te deum 
ma sses were held in the churches 
as the trains pulled out. 

Q: Like a celebration. 

A: Yup. 

Q: Yeah.  
A: So Bacsalmas was -- was even more -- I mean
 -- I mean that -- housed in a chicken coop, I 
believe, terribly cramped. We  kids were running ar
ound the camp, all -- that™s all I reme mber is -
- is we -- running around, all kinds
 of rumors about ways of gett
ing out, some  of whi c h turned 
out true. There was one trai n -- I™m -- I™m -- I™m 
not sure I can reconstr
uct the whole story, but 
it™s in Braham™s book. Eight -- 
Q: Can -- I -- I hate to interrupt you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- we have to take a break -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: -- we have to change the tape. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494

A: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Steve, you were talking about people sa
ying there were wa ys to escape some how. 
A: We ll there was rumor s flying everywhere. It tu
rns out that two tr -- 
one train -- I don™t know 
how ma ny c a rs, but one trainload, mostly of prom
inent people was diverted and sent to -- and 
went to Switzerland, ma ybe 100 - 150 people. A mu
ch s maller group which ma y have been just 
one car, was diverted and taken to Budapest 
and opened up there. And one of -- one of my 
classmates from grade school who now lives in Is
rael was in that group, a
nd it was a relative of 
hers who was in the Hungarian equivalent of 
the ghetto leadership, whatever it was called, 
arranged for that carload to be brought to Budapest
, which at that time  was  still quite free. See ha 

-- the Hungarians -- yo -- as -- as eag
er as the individual gendarme s 
were to do the job, the horti -
- Admi ral Horthy and -- and his governme nt wa
s not that e-eager. So they started on the 
periphery of the -- re-occupied 
provinces from sl ova -- Slovakia,
 Transylvania and -- and Backa 
in the south. And delayed deporta
tion from Buda pest as we -- as 
long as they could. And so my 
friend Lilly survived in Budapest.  

Q: This was your girlfriend? 

A: No, this is a fre -- 

Q: Oh, this is ano -- other friend. 

A: -- a classmate.  

Q: Uh-huh. And she survived in Budapest? 

A: Yeah, she and her mother survived in Budapest
 and walked back -- walked back and got back 
to Subotica. Subotica was liberated in October, 
™44. We  w -- we were deported in -- in June, and 

by f -- by October, the partisans were there. 

Q: Huh. So these trains were diverted by the Je wi sh Council? I mean, they were sa -- some  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
59 
 
A: I tha -- that one -- one carload -- 
Q: That one car? 

A: -- was -- was -- my understanding is that
 it was diverted by the Jewish Council. 
Q: Huh. So did -- when you heard this did you belie
ve it and did you try to 
get on these trains, or 
what?   

A: Well, we tried, but I mean -- one of my cla
ssmates, whom my wife met once, whom all the 
other, the few survivors left bitt
erly hate -- bitterly dislike. He
 was a [indecipherable] from day 
one. He was on that group. He went -- a-after the 
war he came back, he went to Israel, he -- he 
was appointme nt secretary for s -- for some  mi
nister, but he assured everybody that he was 
running the country. You know
, I -- total -- impossible character, 
but he was telling us about all 
of these things, so -- so it was -- 
it wa sn™t easy to believe him. I mean, none of us believed him. 
But anyhow, it was just a few days befo
re the real train ride took place. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: 60 some  people per car. No food, no water, 
no sanitation. People dying. And then the doors 
opened and we were in Auschwitz. 
Q: Now, go back for a mome nt. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you get a notice, or they just say, out, the 
-- just -- th-the same  way they did with the 
other? 

A: Yeah, right, yes, just out, yeah. Line up, and -- 

Q: Now, you also said that you kids, wh
en you were in this second ba -- barc -- 

A: Bachal -- Bacsalma s. 

Q: Bacsalmas. Is that right, Bacsalma s? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
60 
 
A: Yes.  
Q: That you were just 
running around like crazy. 
A: Right. 

Q: What was that? I mean, why we
re you running around?  What -- and -- 
A: We ll, chasing rumors, trying to find food, trying
 -- seeing if possible we could get out. Just -- 

just busy-ness, but I -- that™s what I reme mber is
 -- is this relentless restlessness of trying to do 

some thing. 

Q: Right. Were the adults
 as restless as you were? 

A: No, no, the a-adults were very passive. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: My grandmother had had me ntal problems be
fore. She™s not a Freda Ka hlo, but like Kahlo 
she -- she lost a leg in a stre
etcar accident, I don™t know when. 
And she had -- she had me ntal 
trauma . She was going crazy, there™s just no quest
ion about that. And it -- 
my mother was -- was 
very, very upset. And so getting out of there was 
just -- you know, just -- we just had to get out 
of there, and that™s why I was never in that pl ace.  

Q: So you didn™t stay with them, if you -- 

A: I crawled in at night, I gue
ss, but I don™t reme mber that. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: At dawn I was out of there. 

Q: But it clearly is very chaotic for you there. 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And did you have an idea wh
ere they were sending people? 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
61 
 
Q: No idea?   
A: No. 

Q: And you had never heard of Auschwitz? 

A: No. 

Q: And wha t  had you been hearing about the k
illing of Jews?  Cause he
re you have two years 
between ™42 and ™44, and so ma ny J e ws are ki
lled in ™41 and ™42. Do you hear anything? 

A: Yeah, we heard some . There were -- there 
were a couple people who had escaped from -- I 
don™t know whether it™s from the camp, but certa
inly from the -- from Galicia, from the -- 
occupied Poland. And we were warn
ing, but nobody listened to that.  
Q: [indecipherable] didn™t believe it. 

A: No. No.  

Q: Do you reme mber this train ride? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Can you see it? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You can s -- you can see the train? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Are you sitting, standing? 

A: Mostly standing, sometimes pushing thr -- my wa
y to the crack at the door. Certainly I wasn™t 
tall enough to push myse lf to the -- to the barred window. 

Q: How tall are you?  Cause you
™re now 14 -- or 13, you™re 13. 
A: I -- I don™t know how tall I was,
 I was -- I was sort of reasonable
 ral -- height for my age. Not 
-- not necessarily very tall. Tall 
enough to survive the 
-- the -- the selection.
 Yeah, I remember 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
62 
 
that -- that train ride quite well. And I reme mber
 that chaos that greete
d us. Yells, shouts, dogs 
barking, people shoved out of the cars. My grandmother sitting on a pile of -- of suitcases and 
stuff in her gown, with her prosthesis lacking, 
wa ving to us and saying 
-- saying, ﬁI™m healthy, 
I™m healthy.ﬂ [indecipherable] I forget now what she said, but sh
e cheerfully waved to us. And 
we were lined up. First I was with my  mother and 
sister and then they -- wome n to one side, me n 
to the other side. And that™s the 
last time I saw 
my mother. And eventually five of us, we were 
ma rched past this SS officer in white gloves, 
whether it™s Mengele or
 not I don™t know, I -- I 
couldn™t tell, couldn™t reme mber
. But I guess I was tall enough a
nd healthy looking enough that I 
was waved this way and not that way. So I -- 

Q: Wa s he wearing a white coat as well as white gloves? 

A: White gloves, no, no, mi  -- 

Q: Just white gloves?  White gl -- 

A: -- wi -- military uniform a
nd white gloves, me dical gloves. 
Q: Wa s he actually touching people? 

A: No. 

Q: No. Oka y.  

A: So this endless proc essing, being stripped
 nake d, being shorn, disinfected, sitting, waiting, 

sitting naked on the floor. Eventually rushed, alwa
ys rushed from barrack 
to barrack, tha -- at -- 
at -- at double time  with guards 
barking and hitting. Thrown some  
mi s -- ill -- ill-fitting prison 
uniforms and broken down shoes, and ma rched in
to the compound in a barrack across from the 
Gypsy barracks, where there were about 10,000 --
 abi -- about a thousand kids my age. 
Q: You were with kids your age? 

A: That was a barrack only for kids. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
63 
 
Q: Now, are you tattooed at this time? 
A: No. You were not tattooed til you left the plac
e. I was tattooed when I -- in October when I 
left. Until then you weren™t even a nu mber. 

Q: Now that™s a little unusual, so I™m justwondering whether it was because you were a group of 

kids. 

A: No. Whe n they -- the huge onslaught in 
summer of ™44, of -- of the Hungarian -- 
Q: You were not tattooed. 

A: They were not and when they -- when -- la
ter when the Lódz ghetto was emptied and they 
were brought in, they were not
 tattooed until they left. 

Q: Right. So w -- 

A: You -- you can check my -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, I -- 

A: -- you can -- you can check the -- 
the Auschwitz, the big Auschw
itz diary doesn™t have it on a 
weekly basis, but occasi
onally it has a list of --  
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- of serial numbers. 

Q: Right. 

A: Mine is fr om October -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- not from -- 

Q: No, no, it [indecipherable] right. 

A: -- not from June. 

Q: But it™s a -- it™s an unusual ci rcumstance --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
64 
 
A: Well, I mean that  -- 
Q: -- so it™s interesting. Maybe 
it™s only for the Hungarians. 
A: That n -- I mean, that -- 
that  load on the system -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the -- the gas chambers, crematoria and th
e processing area was -- 
was -- I don™t think there 
had been that much of it, that volume , before that summer.  

Q: Do you come  in with the large 
Hungarian transpor
ts, or do -- 
A: Yes, all of Bacsalma s. I mean, I don™
t know how many trains from Bac salmas. 
Q: You don™t know how ma ny. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you™re in a barrack, you™re in B2D, I guess. 

A: Something tha -- 
yeah, yeah, right. 

Q: Some thing like that. And B2E ha s some  Gyps ies? 
A: The whole row, [indecipherable] on the fem - -
 if I can vi sualize the map, the norther -- the 
northeastern quadrant of the compound was all Gypsies, all Gypsy fa milies. 
Q: Cause there™s a big killing of
 Gypsies in May before you come . 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But there are some  Gypsies left. 

A: But there™s one in August. 

Q: Right, that™s right. 

A: Right. That one I remember. 

Q: That™s what -- that™s wh
at the one that you reme mber. 
A: Right, yup. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
65 
 
Q: Do you get a number on your uniform?  
A: Nope.  

Q: You have nothing. 

A: Nothing. I -- I have my ID card, I mean my
 index card from Buchenwald. I don™t know how it 
worked in Auschwitz, but everything was record
ed and everything was in the books. I got these 

terrible broken down shoes. 

Q: We re they wooden? 

A: Wooden. The wooden sole broken. Terrible sores on 
my foot. I took myself 
to the revier -- to 
the hospital wing, and I sat there 
waiting, nobody would service me . 
Appe l started, and the entire 
compound was on block -- on lockdown because one number was out of order. And I reme mber 

very clearly this very large SS office r, and th
is small, owlish, Polish kapo came to get me  and 
ma rched me  in front of all of the assembled pe
ople back to my barracks and I reme mb er clearly 
the Polish kapo whispering to me  in Polish, 
ﬁIf you were not this
 young, you would be long 
dead.ﬂ Yup, I -- for a day I upset the entire accounting system. How they knew that, I don™t 

know. 

Q: Wait a minute.  

A: How they knew that -- 

Q: How -- how are you upsetting th
e counting system?  You don™t -- 
A: The barrack was short one and the revier wa
s -- was one mo re than was supposed to be. 
Q: Supposed to have. And were -- we re they identifying you by name ?  

A: I don™t know. I have no -- 

Q: You don™t know. You have no idea. 

A: -- th -- the -- no, th
ey found me  and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
66 
 
Q: Now you said this guy, the Po
lish kapo spoke to
 you in Polish. 
A: Yes. 
Q: How did you understand Polish? 

A: Serbian and Polish are -- 

Q: Are so close? 

A: -- si -- six weeks later I -- I was fluent in 
Polish because I was working for the Polish kapos. 
Q: Really?  Huh.  

A: So okay. So you know enough about Auschwitz, 
you know that camps C and D were largely 

warehouses of labor personnel. German civilians 
came in, selection was set up, usually in the -- 
naked, not always. They selected the workers and 
those people were ma rched out ta -- a -- first 
into compound A and then registered, tattooed a
nd sent out. Digression. A 
number of years ago 
at Pittsburgh, we hosted a small exhibit from
 the Auschwitz museum. There was an opening 
night for the survivors. Was a big map of Ausc
hwitz. And seven or eigh
t people there asked me  
to take them over to the map a
nd show them where they had bee
n, because most of them were 
there three, four days. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I was there four months. And I have a 
reasonably good graphic me
mory and so I showed 
them anywa y. So that was camp life. At that time wa -- 

Q: Wa  -- when -- when you™re showing them the ma p, they™re looking at the outside 

commandoes that they we re on, they 
didn™t know that they were all -- 
A: No, they were not on there, th
ey were all in one of the -- 
Q: So they were -- but they 
didn™t know where they were? 
A: The people who were there only 
three days we re there in one -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
67 
 
Q: I see. 
A: -- in either C or D. 

Q: Right, and they didn™t know that. 

A: They didn™t know that. 

Q: Of course, right. 

A: So the boys barrack was treated like every ot
her, you know, once a day allowed to run to the 
ra -- latrine. You know, you learn 
things on the way, like a elder 
-- ol der inmate telling you to -- 
to pick up a pebble on the way to the latrine, 
so you have something 
to wipe yourself with. 
Q: A pebble? 

A: Yes. Food, ladled out from these big cauld
rons. Some how you had -- an -- and the slice of 
bread, some how you had to save enough to have enough on -- on the black ma rket to get yourself 

a broken down tin cup, otherwise th
e soup was ladled in your hand. 
Q: So you were not given a cup at all? 
A: No. 
Q: Nothing. 

A: No. And we could see people co
mi ng and going in the barracks, 
in the barrack that we were 
in, nobody was comi ng, and the only going was -- wa
s to the selection an
d to the -- to the 
crematoria. My -- all my classmates, one by one
, becomi ng walking corpses, mussel manner, and 
dying. I rem -- I mean, I still reme mb er the sequence 
of the last three or four, until I wa s alone. 
Q: Until you were alone? 

A: Out of the group from Subotica. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
68 
 
Q: And how do you account for your be
ing able to [indecipherable] 
A: We ll, one thing my gra -- my governess did me 
a great service. The ka
pos were all red fr -- 
were all green triangles, German pol itical prison
er -- German criminals, and they needed an 
interpreter and one of them ca me  around asking 
for an interpreter and 
I volunteered. I spoke 
much better German than he did, mu ch purer Vo
lksdeutsche than he did. And so I became  an 
interpreter, and one of the priv
ileges that came  wi th it at -- 
after the soup was ladled out, you 
were allowed to scrape  out the bottom of
 the -- of the pot. A
nd that was the -- 
Q: That was the [indecipherable] 

A: -- incr ement that  kept me alive. 

Q: We re you losing weight? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: You was -- you lost a lot of weight? 

A: Yes. So, as I say, one by one, there were about 
seven or eight of us th
at were together, that 
knew each ot her, were together, and then --  

Q: And they died from star
vation, or they were killed? 

A: Yup. They was -- died from starvation. 

Q: They died of starvation. When y
ou say the word musselmanner now -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: Is that a word that you knew then? 

A: Yes. 

Q: This is what the terminology was? 

A: Yes, this shuffling corpses, glazed eyes, yeah. 
That was the defi nitely the -- the term. So then 
came Augus t, this night in August we were lo
cked down. I remember very clearly yelling, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
69 
 
shouting, firing of weapons. And we didn™t know what was going on. We  started singing, just to 
give ourselves strength or some thing. And the foll
owing morning, as an in
terpreter, I could be 
out in front when the soup arrived. And I l
ooked around, the row of barracks was empty. There 
were inmates clearing and later whitewashing the barracks. And what was most startling is that  

the kapos that supervised them had red triangl
es. So one o -- one of them, ma n by name  Tadek, 
came over and said that he needed an interpre
ter who spoke Polish, Germ
an and Hungarian. And 
I said Serbian and Polish are close enough, I volunt
eered. And so that day I moved across to the 
barrack that he supervised. 

Q: Which was E, into E. Or is that  not -- 

A: I -- if you give -- show me  a ma  
-- if you give me  a ma p, I™ll -- I™ll -- 
Q: Okay [indecipherable] 

A: -- I™ ll locate the number. 

Q: But le-let me  ask you some thing. Why was 
it so shocking to you that those who were 
supervising that barrack, where they
 had ex -- grabbed the Gypsies -- 
A: No, supervising the new -- new inma te
s, so it [indecipherable] the barracks. 

Q: Wa  -- why -- oh, and why was it surprisi
ng that they were political prisoners? 
A: Because -- because up til then
 we were surrounded by the --  
Q: By the greens?  

A: By the greens. 

Q: By the criminals. 

A: Yes, except a coup -- one or two in
 the higher admi nist
ration of the camp. 
Q: Right, right. And having the political prisoners
 meant it would be better in some  wa y, was 
that true? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
70 
 
A: We ll, it meant it would be different. The political
 prisoners at -- in Auschwitz as we ll as in -- 
later in Niederorschel, in front
 of the Germans we re as loud and cussing. They were as adroit 
with their batons in hitting you 
as the criminals. But when the 
Germans we re gone, then -- then 
things were different.  
Q: Mm-hm. Which wasn™t true with the criminals. 

A: Which was not true with the criminals. 

Q: Right. 

A: And so I -- 

Q: So you joined them. 

A: So I joined them, and -- 

Q: What was Tadek like? 

A: He was a university student, communist. Ca
ught up in the -- the big catching up ca -- round 
up of Polish intellect uals. Not a terr ibly bright  
guy, but eventu -- I mean, he promised he would 
take care of me . There were others. There was 
a some what older guy, a kapo of one of the other 
barracks, who had been a c-communi st organize
r in Yugoslavia, so he -- he helped me  
occasiona lly with things I couldn™t translate. A
nd there was a third one by name  of Piotr, who 
was a Russian studying in Poland, who was caught 
up and was deported with the Poles. And he 
was by far the most entrepreneur ial 
and enterprising of all of them. 
Q: Can you explain what you mean, why -- ho -- 

A: We ll, black ma rket was -- was the staff of lif
e in Auschwitz. Everything could be had. We  
[indecipherable] work with Tadek and Piotr. Th
ey -- the compound backed onto the railroad side 

[indecipherable]. We  would -- wh
en a train arrived, we would 
be there sweeping the gr avel 
between the last barrack and the 
-- and the electrified fence. 
Guard towers at either end. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
71 
 
Occasionally whis -- whistle would sound, you would look up and tins of sardines, ot her thing 
liberatable. You know, liberating wa
s the -- the codeword to stea
ling, or fl ying over the fence, 
from the inma tes who were cleaning the trains
. So that™s how you started accumulating black 
ma rket goods. Piotr -- we ll, I had my  -- my duties,
 I was an interpreter. Very often German 
people were lined up, German foreman will -- w
ould come . I would walk behind them and do 
whatever translating, if -- if 
they had questions for the inma
tes. And most inma tes always 
pretended that they didn™t know German, whether 
they knew it or not. So
 I would translate. 
Occasionally I actually esc -- was or
dered to go up to the front, to the SS barracks at the top of 
the compound and escort the German to the -- to th
e site, to whatever barr
ack they were selecting 
from, and then escort them back. 

Q: What was that like? 

A: Past the -- passing the gallows
 every day twice, it was not -- 
not pleasant. But in addition to 
that, eventually Piotr organized a roof repair
 detail. And we went from compound to compound 
pretending to patch roofs. 

Q: Pretendi ng? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I have a -- a -- I don™t have a full sense of equi
librium, I have a fear of heights. I would have 
reme mbered if I had been on a roof
, I™ve never been to -- on a roof. 
Q: Did he go up on a roof? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: He went up? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
72 
 
A: Yeah, we -- we had this -- this
 cart with rolls of felt paper, ba
rrel of pitch, both of them very 
good for hiding things as you go from -- as you™
re frisked from com
pound to compound. And 
they -- you know, they pretended to be patching r
oofs and -- and most of -- I mean it was spent 
trading black ma rket goods
, trading lists of prisoners to be 
smuggled out to the outside. Typical 
day to day work of resistance. 
Q: So you were the ground crew -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- for the roofer. 

A: Right. 

Q: I guess, huh? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And unfortunately we have to stop the tape again. 

A: Okay.

Q: Steve. 
A: Yeah? 

Q: When we  last were taping, you were talki
ng about not being a r
oofer, but walking around 
with -- was it Tadek who was -- 

A: No, that™s -- that was Piotr. 

Q: Piotr, who was going on the roof. 

A: A-Actually, I -- I will correct myself. I wason the roof of our old barracks, numbe r 12, with 

couple others, there was an opening in the roof. 
And we tried to pull out my last classmate. 
Lowered a rope and tried to pull him up, and he didn™
t have the strength in his arms to -- to hold 
on. That™s -- that time I reme mber being in the 
roof, and I reme mber this incident because a 
number of years ago, when I was 
at the tekneon, this -- the guy™s 
sister came  to see me because 
she understood that I had -- had seen
 him in Ausc hwitz, and she want
ed the story of her brother. 
But that™s the only th
ing -- only time I reme mber being on the roof. 
Q: And why were you trying to pull him out? 

A: Trying to save him.  

Q: Uh-huh -- 

A: Trying to get -- 

Q: -- so you were -- you were goi
ng to put him some place else. 
A: Right, right. 

Q: And you were able to be on the roof
 in spite of your problems with -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But that must have been a horrible 
day then, not being able to pull him out. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
74 
 
A: Yeah, right, yeah. 
Q: And wa -- going around fixing roofs, did he -- di
d Piotr actually fix roof
s or was it mainly -- 
A: Oh, I think, yeah. I mean this -- the barrack
s were shoddily built and shod -- and totally u -- 
not maintained and so there were roof leaks a
nd we had pitch and felt paper and we did -- the 

crew did some  repairs, but -- bu
t that was really a cover for -- 
for black ma rket operations. He 
had a girlfriend, a fema l e  kapo in -- in one of 
the compounds in -- in Mexico, the -- the new -- 
the new wome n™s comp ounds in the other side of
 the ma in road. And we were -- often went 
there. I me t my sister there. I found out that sh
e wa -- she was there and we met. Sh -- this was 
late in the fall, and she was in a short sleeve 
dress, reddish hair, ma ybe centime ter long, no -- no 
longer than that. Face and arms red raw from the 
wind. She reme mbers that I was this fat, that™s 
how she described me . Well, probably in -- in 
Auschwitz co mparisons, I was fatter than -- than 

what her image was. So I -- I found out that 
she was being shipped out on a transport and 
whatever black ma rket goods I had, I cashed in 
and ma nage d to get her a -- a sweater and scarf 
and gloves before she was shipped out. Managed to
 get somebody to get it to
 her, after the -- the 
-- o-on exit. But we went everywhere. 

Q: So he had the right to go everywhere, whether it was [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, we -- well [indecipherable] right -- yea
h. Frisking at ev -- every entrance and every exit 
from a comp ound. In Auschwitz the -- the comm
on black ma rket currency was a gold watch. 
Everything was counted in -- in 
terms of gold watches. And I 
was thin enough, I usually had 
dozen or mo re gold watches strapped to my thi
gh, so we went through frisking and I wa s never 
caught. 

Q: How cou l d that be? 

A: Well -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
75 
 
Q: But you had them on your thigh and they didn™t -- 
A: Yeah, under my pants, and they didn™t frisk
 that far down. I don™t 
know, I don™t know. So 
Kanada was a great place to go because lots of 
-- lots of good could be interchanged. They were 

ke -- contact with the under -- with the 
Polish underground, they were -- you could pass 
information to the outside commandoes and they
 -- they were working outside the fence, and 
they -- the Polish underground was never more than 
a couple kilometers from the perimeter. So 
we knew about the -- the 
Sonderkommando uprising. 
Q: Did you hear it? 

A: We her -- I don™t remember hearing, but I 
do reme mber the -- the extreme anxiety and the 
extreme unusual severity of the 
-- the controls in the watchtow
ers and that™s -- that™s all I 
reme mber about it.  

Q: We  -- were you anywhere near when the wo
me n were hung because of 
the stealing of powde r 
from [indecipherable] 
A: No, no, n-n-no, no. 
Q: You weren™t? 

A: No. I don™t reme mber . I mean I™m just not [indecipherable] 

Q: You just don™t reme mber. 

A: Right.  

Q: When you went to see your 
sister, wasn™t she on the same  transport with you when she came 
into Auschwitz? 

A: Yes, but then we were separated, and she was 
separated from our mother
 right -- almost right 
away. She had the information that our mother
 was -- my mother had asthma and she thought 
that -- that she had an asthma attack and -- and 
that she was not yet dead she wa -- when she was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
76 
 
carted away with the -- the day™s corpses to the cr
ematorium.  It™s the best she could determine. 
So -- so you know, th -- I last saw her in June, an
d this must have been September, thereabouts. 
Q: Right. 
A: I reme mb er it was beginning to get cold. 

Q: So you didn™t know until then that she was alive. 

A: I knew -- right
, right, right, 
Q: You thought she mi ght have been -- 

A: Right. Well, either 
shipped out or s --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- killed, I don™t -- didn™t know. 

Q: And her condition, was she okay? 

A: She was emaciated, and as I said there, you 
know, totally unprotecte
d from the weather.  
Q: Yeah. So what did it mean for you to be in
 this group?  We re they 
really doing resistance, 
were they doing it -- 

A: Well, it was something to do. It was a will to liv
e. I mean, seemed to be some pur pose to life 
rather than just waiting to be carted away to 
the crematorium.  And you know, I think back, I -- I 
-- the chance of surviving, the e
xpectation to survive was very 
low, and you just did whatever 
you could to keep yourself busy. And -- and quite fr
ankly, on occasions they -- they certainly -- 

the kapos certainly used me for being much sma
ller to get into places where they coul dn™t get 
into, to do hand-offs that -- that they felt they
 were too exposed, so yeah, I -- I ma de myself 
useful any -- any way I could. 

Q: So what -- what would it be for you to
 hand off?  Is this a bartering system? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
77 
 
A: No, ma  -- it was mostly issues of -- of handi
ng off lists of prisoners to the -- to the outside 
commandoes, to be sent out to the -- to the -- 
to the out -- Polish unde
rground on the outside. 
Q: So people would have name s, so they would know -- 

A: Right, right. 

Q: -- what wa s going on. 

A: Right. 

Q: And whe r e do the lists come  fr
om?  They weren™t -- w-were they paying for [indecipherable] 
A: Well, all the orderlies in 
the -- in the -- in the offices 
were also political prisoners. 
Q: So there™s a very extensive underground system -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- that™s going on. 

A: Right. 

Q: And are you involved with people who are mainly
 doing infor mational re
sistance, or are they 
also connected with the people 
who are going to do an uprising? 
A: There was no -- I -- I -- I -- not
 in Auschwitz, there was no -- I 
don™t recall any talk of any 
physical resistance because it was just -- just 
not possible. [indeciphe
rable] was differe nt. 
Q: But there was an uprising, so that there was 
physical resistance because the crematoria was 
blown up, right? 

A: Yeah, well -- well, yeah, but the Sonde
rkommando had privileges that even the -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the kapos in the regular compounds didn™t 
ha ve. They [indecipherabl e] access to food, to -- 
to alcohol, to bribe the -- the guard and all ki
nds of other things that
 -- I mean, they were 
privileged prisoners [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
78 
 
Q: But when you -- when one says privilege
d, they™re still in a 
horrible situation. 
A: Oh yes, yes, of course, yeah. 
Q: Right, so it™s priv
ileged in a very -- 
A: Right, right, and very 
relevant, very relevant -- 

Q: -- specific [indecipherable] 

A: -- yes. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Would you have considered 
yourself a privileged prisoner? 
A: Oh definitely, definitely. 

Q: But were you actually protected from selections? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You were? 
A: Especially in the fall when
 things got severe, th-they hid 
me. One time I was hiding in a 
latrine, up to my mouth in excrement. Then I ha
d to find a -- the lavatory
 barracks and sneak in 
and get a -- take a sh -- cold shower with clot
hes on to get some  of the smell off. Ye ah, they 
protected me, yes. 
Q: So they protected you, it™s not like as if
 you were in a protected komma ndo so that the SS 
wouldn™t get you. It™s that the -- that th
ese me n themselves were protecting you. 
A: Yes, right, right, yes. 

Q: But going into latrine doesn™t sound -- 

A: Well, that  -- 

Q: -- to a normal perso -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
79 
 
A: Right. 
Q: -- regular person, like it™
s terribly much protection. 
A: Well, if that was the place to hi
de, then that was the pl ace to hide. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Yup. 

Q: When you think about this now, thinking about yourself as you™re clos
e to 14, or thirt -- you 
were really 13 actually -- 

A: Yup, right. 

Q: -- right? 

A: Right. 

Q: Doing this, can you conceive of yourself in this
, or just this seems like, well it™s my history, 
it™s just the way it was. 

A: Oh, I th -- yeah, I can conceive myself doing it
, I -- I did what I could, 
I -- I -- I -- I™m grateful 
to have had the opportun
ity to -- to do some th
ing, not to just sit. 
Q: Now these -- these -- when you say 
that these are Polish kapos, or -- 
A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: -- you -- you mean that 
they™re Polish Gentiles -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- these are not Jews. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. But they know you™re Jewish. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And there™s not a problem in terms of [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
80 
 
A: No, they were violent anti-Semite
, all of them, without exception. 
Q: They were? 
A: Oh yes. Without exception. 

Q: So what was that like for you?  On the one 
hand they™re protectingyou, on the other hand -- 
A: We ll -- we ll, now, for the duration of the hostil
ities, they suspended thei
r -- their animosity, or 
hatred, or whatever you want to call it. But you 
-- you know, the ordinary talk, ex -- especially 
after a few vodka, the cuss terms for Jews was -- 
was as sharp as -- as the terms that the SS 
guards used. No -- no distinction. 

Q: Did it ma ke you feel f -- strange, as a Jewish pe
rson, or not want to be 
Jewish, or that didn™t 
occur to you? 

A: That didn™t occur to me , no. Ju
st was part of the surroundings.  
Q: So those years of living under 
the Hungarian occupation, while th
ere™s not violence so much -
- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- there™s still a lot of anti-Semitism. So do 
you think you start getting 
used to it, you just 
expect this to be the case for a lot of people? 

A: Yeah, yes, definitely. 

Q: Cause certainly it doesn™t 
seem to be easy to accept it. 
A: It definitely was something to accept, yeah. 

Q: Now, do you kno -- are -- are you still involved
 at -- where are you living?  Are you living in 
B2 bi -- D, or are you living in the same place that you began? 

A: In the same  co -- in -- in -- in compound D, 
but in one of the barracks on the opposite side and 
further down. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
81 
 
Q: Than when you started. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. And are you with any Jews? 

A: Everybody™s Jew -- 

Q: Everybody™s Jewish, except these guys -- 

A: Except the -- except the -- the kapo
s, yeah. All the orderlies wi -- 
Q: Now do they mi strust you because you™re with these ot her guys, and being an interpreter? 

A: No.  

Q: No. 

A: I mean, the front office in the barracks is 
-- is -- you know, ma ybe eight or 10 orderlies, and 
by that time they were all Lódz Jews. And then 
in the back, or -- eigh
t - 900, thousand inmates 
who rotate out on -- on very short time basis. That was the life. 

Q: And wha t  do you understand what the Nazis 
are doing?  I -- you -- 
you know that they™re 
killing Jews in Auschwitz. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you know at this point that
 there™s widespread killing? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And that they™re trying to kill all Jews? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You know this? 

A: Yes. Def -- yeah. 

Q: So you -- you don™t have much of an expectation of surviving this? 

A: Like zero. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
82 
 
Q: Zero?  
A: Yup. 

Q: But you -- 

A: But I never gave up, I mean -- 

Q: But you never gave up.  

A: Every opportunity I could to -- to do some thing 
like that. I never allowed 
myself to -- to give 
up. 

Q: Wa s your sister a similar way -- 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: -- when you spoke to her afterwards? 

A: Yes, yup. 

Q: And are you hearing things about the progres
s of the war also?  Are the rumors going around -
- 
A: Ah yes, some  of the smuggling was the ot
her way, from t he underground on the outside, so 
yes, we knew some thing about the 
-- well, in -- in that location 
we knew a lot more about the -- 
the eastern fr ont than the -- than the western fr ont. 
Q: So is some  of your -- not desire to live, but ability to keep going, also a function of thinking 

well ma ybe the war will end, 
ma ybe they™ll be ri -- 

A: Oh yes, de -- yes, by that time  it wa
s beginning to -- to 
look like that, yeah. 
Q: It wa -- it was beginning to look up? 

A: Yeah, right.  

Q: Are there ma ny kids around your age, or are they mostly gone? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
83 
 
A: I don™t reme mber if the kid™
s barrack continued. Now, a mong th
e later transport -- among the 
Budapest Jews that came later, July or -- or A
ugust, there were quite a few father son groups -- 
pairs. And I think among the Lódz Jews also. So 
you™d did doos -- did see some kids teen -- in 
their teens. 
Q: But they don™t necessarily 
stay very long in Auschwitz? 

A: They not necessarily stay in Auschwitz, a
nd I don™t reme mber ma ny of them being alone, 
they were usually with their father
s. I reme mber that very clearly. 
Q: Do you feel protected, do you feel 
close -- a-and close to these guys? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: You do? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So, are they nice to you in some  ways? 

A: Yes. Yup. 
Q: Are they warm as wel l , when -- 
A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: Because this must be difficult, you are still a child, in a way. 

A: Right, right. 

Q: And not receivi ng affection and -- 

A: Oh, I me  -- in those circumstances, 
ya -- normal emotions don™t -- don™t -- 
Q: Don™t count. 

A: -- don™t do much. But you™re
 better off without them. 
Q: You™re better off without them. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
84 
 
Q: Why?  
A: Oh, it™s ha -- it™s -- it™s -- it
™s just baggage, it -- it -- very 
ha-hard to carry around. Lot of ri -- 
writers have -- have said that. Kids had an eas
ier time surviving than adults, that you were not 
conditioned by civilization, and I -- th
at™s definitely the case that I 
reme mbered. That I dare to do 
things that adults 
would -- would not do. 
Q: Do you think that you became more primitive in some  way? 

A: Oh yeah, by all means, yes -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- yes. Ye s.  

Q: Does -- when you look back, doe
s it surprise you how easy it is to
 become  so diffe rent than 
what you were before? 

A: Yeah, in a -- tha -- yes, definitely. But you 
know, it -- it wa s -- entrance 
to Auschwitz was this 
deep, deep, deep imme r s ion into hell that you 
couldn™t con -- possibly 
conceive. And you either 
got out of it, or you didn™t get out of it. And I don™t know what in 
my make-up helped me to -- to 
get out of it, other than the -- my go
verness™ s effort to teach me Ger man. 

Q: [indecipherable] terrible govern
ess. You saw a lot of hangings. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Wa s that the first time you saw a dead person? 

A: No, in -- no, in 1941, at -- when the Hunga
rians came in, 13 young people were hung in the 
public square, including the -- th
e rabbi™s son, and I reme mbe r  
seeing that hanging. So I -- I -- 
yes, I™d seen a hanging before. 

Q: You had seen it before. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
85 
 
Q: Did you see beatings in Auschwitz? 
A: All the time. 

Q: All the time . Was there sort of a gen -- you kn
ow, people just walk around and all of a sudden 
they would be hit, or did you -- 

A: Yes, oh yeah, ra -- yeah, random violence all the time . 

Q: And did you see people who were being punished and beaten? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What did it make you think 
about huma n beings?  Did you -- 
A: Hoping that it wasn™t me . I mean -- 

Q: Oh, you hoped it wasn™t you. 

A: Yeah -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- I mean, you get -- you become very selfish. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Self-centered and selfish.  

Q: Did you see the people who were help
ing you, being brutal to other people? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And did you ever say to them, how can you -- 

A: No. 

Q: No. We r e  you ever afraid that they 
would ask you to do that kind of thing? 
A: No. 

Q: You weren™t? 

A: No. They would -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
86 
 
Q: They wouldn™t have done it? 
A: No, they wouldn™t have asked me , no. But, I mean, I have some  recollections which I™m not 

very proud of. I reme mb er one day very clearly having a snack before di-di-distribution of dinner 

-- in -- in -- a slice 
of bread, and three sl
ices of cheese on it, and going outside for a 
[indecipherable] standing for the appel, and one of
 them said, ﬁ What is the ration tonight? ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁOne of these slices of cheese.ﬂ And I was 
eating three or four as a snack. And another time 
-- shoes were always an issue, and mi ne were -- 
were again, very beaten 
up and Tadek saw a pair 
on a ma n, a pair of ski boots that he thought w
ould be good for me  and made him take them off 
and take my broken down shoes, and he gave h
im a loaf of bread. And I didn™t feel good about 
that. 

Q: But you now have ski boots? 

A: Yes. Yeah. So that was -- that was 
life in Auschwitz. I became very callous. 
Q: Yeah, ma kes perfect sense though. 
A: Clawing t -- clawing through life. 
Q: Wa s there a canteen in Auschwitz that you 
knew about where you could go and get, I don™t 
know, juice or cigarettes or some thing. Wa
s there a place that people could exchange? 
A: Yeah, ther e was a canteen in th -- I-I mean, 
I understand Auschwitz itself there were several 
canteen -- 

Q: You me a n Auschwitz one? 

A: -- in -- in -- in Birkenau, 
Auschwitz two, I think there wa
s a canteen. I don™t know who had 
access to it, but we -- we got thin
gs with black market things. 
Q: So you didn™t go to the canteen? 

A: Oh, I™d -- I™d been to the canteen ma ny ti me s. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
87 
 
Q: You were? 
A: Yeah,  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But bartering. 

Q: As opposed to -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- purch -- I don™t know what they purchased. 

A: There -- yeah, there was some  -- there wa
s some  scrip. Yeah, everything was bartered 
[indecipherable], passes to the wome n™s b -- to th
e -- to the prisoner™s brothel was so ma ny gold 
watches. And then you got -- 

Q: So ma ny gold watches. 

A: -- and then you got a pass. 

Q: And did you know people who went? 
A: Yup. 
Q: Did you go? 

A: No. 

Q: No. Could you have gone? 

A: I guess not, I don™t know. 

Q: A-As a Jewish boy? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: The kapos around me  all had girl
friends in a -- in -- kapos in 
the -- in the women™s barracks, 
they didn™t have to go to the brothel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
88 
 
Q: And were they ab -- they were able 
to go in and out of the wome n™s barracks? 
A: Well, one time I -- I reme mber -- I reme mber one 
times very clearly Piotr was in bed with this 
woma n and an SS came in and I was in the out -- out
er room, and all I -- and all of these wome n 
orderlies had these beautifully el abor ate ta --  beds -- beds with silk bedcovers and silk pillows, 
everything pilfered or bar -- bart
ered from Kanada. And all I coul
d think of is slide under bed 
[indecipherable] bed with the bedcover to the fl
oor, and then it was over and they started asking 
each other whether they had seen me  or whethe
r the SS woma n had taken me , and then I climbed 
out from under the bed. I reme mber that. 

Q: You just went under because you
 wanted the feel of the -- 
A: Ah no, I just slid -- 

Q: Oh, slid on top? 

A: -- I slid on the floor, I slid on the floor. 

Q: I see, I see. 
A: Under the -- and the bedcover cam
e all the way down to the floor. 
Q: Oh, oh, I see. 
A: Yeah. So -- 

Q: Did you know -- di -- did people talk about
 who were the wome n in the brothels? 
A: No, I don™t reme mber  ever -- but when I got
 to Niederorsc hel which will sooner -- come  

sooner or later, one of the questions I was asked, 
is it true that wome n we
r e  selected on their 
looks to go to work in brothels
? And I said no, I don™t know if a
nything that -- that -- I™ve seen 
ma ny wome n™s selections, I™ve never seen wome n bei
ng selected on the basis 
of looks. I lied, but 

I -- 

Q: You lied? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
89 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Why?  

A: Because I™d seen that. 

Q: That they were selected and you kne
w they were going to be prostitutes? 

A: Right. But to these me n --  

Q: You didn™t want them to know. 

A: No.  

Q: Steve, how did you know that they were
 selecting wome n to 
go to the brothels? 
A: Because kapos were talking about it. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And comparing the -- particul
arly the wome n kapos were comp
aring the -- the condition -- the 
relative conditions of the various
 brothels, that™s why, you know. 
Q: Comparing -- 
A: Some -- some were better than others
. You know, don™t ask me  why, but that™s -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- that™s what they were talking 
about, so I knew wh
at this meant. 
Q: Uh-huh. So you were in Auschwitz for how long?  Six months? 

A: From mi d -- end of June til mi d-Octobe
r, July, August, September, four months. 
Q: Four mo nths. So you leave after the uprising? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Now wha t  are the conditions? How -- how come  you get out of Auschwitz and go to 

Niederorsc he l? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
90 
 
A: We ll, the conditions were ge
tting harsher and harsher, and 
the kapos decided to smuggle me  
out. And they were looking for a safe transpor
t because the word was that some ti me s people 
were turned around at the railroad
 siding and taken to the gas ch
ambers. So this one transport 
appeared safe, they pushed me  in the line. I -- 
I got tattooed -- no, ever
ything gets counted. One 
of the kapos, I don™t know if it was Tadek, I don™
t reme mber any more, went up, who -- who will 
trade places with this boy, we™ll 
give you food and we™ll ma ke sure that you get out on another 
transport. And this ma n volunteered and I was pu
shed in. Piotr slipped me  a gold watch in my 
hand, he -- for the doctor. So we were stripped, examined. Ha d a Jewish inma te doctor 
examining. I passed him the watch, he said, ﬁThank you, I would have passed you anyhow.ﬂ 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. Next station is tatt
ooing and this inma te working, these huge, crude numbers and he 
looks up at me  and he gives the tin
iest number that I™ve ever seen.  
Q: Do you still have it? 
A: Yup. But you know, that is 
-- it™s almost illegible now because it™s so small. 
Q: Right. And your number is? 
A: B13174. Shower, cold shower in October. At 
the next station Piotr appears and shoves a 
bundle of clothes in my hand, incl
uding the -- the ski boots, which 
I left with him and he -- and 
so I was quite well dressed. I have -- I™m sure it 
was a woma n -- woma n™ s tight fitting ski jacket, 
because it buttoned like a woman™s jacket, and my 
boots and an overcoat, which just had a stripe 

painted in the back, not the cut in.  

Q: Not the what? 

A: Not the pi ece of stripe d clothe  cut in, 
which is what all the other clothes were. 
Q: Right, this is one stripe?

ches wide and few inches long. 
Q: And wha t  was the color?

Q: I thought you said there was a paint stripe. 

A: This one was just  a red paint stripe. 

Q: Right.

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Steven, we were talking about
 your leaving. Do you have a sens
e of who this group of people 
were?  We re these Hungarians that were 
going to Niederorschel, or this -- 
A: I can show you the -- the bill of lading that 
I got in Buchenwald. I™m listed as a Sl ovakian 
Jew, because this was a group from - -  from Slovakia, and I wa s pushed in between them. 
Q: And you were pushed in between those. 

A: Yup. Yeah. 

Q: When -- why was there a Jewish doctor st
anding there?  It™s a little hard t -- 
A: We ll, th-the -- the -- the processing line involves a absolutely cursory medical examination, 

and that was a inma te doctor who was doing it.  

Q: Were these people -- had they come from 
out side of Auschwitz, and they were passing 
through after a -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- day or two?  Do you have any idea who -- 
A: No, no, no, these were -- 

Q: These were Slovakian Jews who were in the camp?  

A: Oh, oh, oh, the ones who were going out? 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Yes, they -- they had just been there days. 

Q: Now, were they all tattooed? 

A: Yes. 

Q: On the way out? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
93 
 
A: On the way out. But the doctor, you asked, I™m 
sure he was a -- a standard inma te wa -- of 
some  standing, I -- I don™t know. 
Q: And Tadek gave you the gold watch? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And did he assume  that there wou -- there could be a problem -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- that the doctor would not pass you -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- and you would be sent to the gas? 

A: I -- I wou -- I wou -- what happens if they 
s -- I -- I mean it was unclear what would have 

happened if the doctor found reason for me  not to
 be put on the outgoing tr
ansport, I don™t know. 
Q: And do you have any idea why they allowed you 
to be showered, because you were leaving?  I 
mean, what was -- 
A: Well amid this --  this incredible barbarity 
and filth, ther e was also the German fascination 
with cleanliness. And all these slogans in the 
barracks, where you had to
 use pebbles to wipe 
yourself, there were big slogans on the wall a
bout healthy body keeps 
you alive and God knows 
what else. So ever -- every process involved a 
shower in cold water a
nd -- and disinfection of 
some  -- walking through some  disinfectant like [i
ndecipherable] and I mean, that™s wa s just part 
of the routine.  
Q: Was there soap? 

A: Aaarrrgh. 

Q: No soap, okay. 

A: No soap. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
94 
 
Q: No towel, I™m sure -- 
A: No towel -- 

Q: -- to wipe yourself. So -- this 
is cold weather, cause it™s -- 
A: It™s cold weather. 

Q: -- Poland in October. 

A: Right, right. 

Q: Right?  

A: Right. And there were -- I was naked and shiver
ing, running from one  barra
ck to the next with 
my bundle of clothes, and a guard stops me  a
nd he said, ﬁWhere are you going?  How old are 
you?  What is your birth date? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁA
pril 16, 1929,ﬂ because the -- the ka pos drilled me  
to use my sister™s birthday so I -- that I woul
d appear older. And he 
say -- said okay, and he 
passed me . So -- so we got dressed, ma rched to 
the trains, and I reme mbe r  very long wait on the 

siding. Eventually the train star
ted. Three days on the train. 
Q: Three?  

A: Three days. Wa  -- once a day we were let out. 

Q: And this is a cattle 
car similar to what you -- 
A: Right, right, yes. 

Q: -- had in comi ng to Auschwitz. 

A: Right. I reme mber looking in the window. I re
me mber seeing kids my age romping in the 
snow and building snowme n and thinking about that.  

Q: But now you™re tall enough so you can see out. 

A: I guess so. 

Q: You guess so, huh? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
95 
 
A: I guess so. And so eventually we arrive, 
railroad siding. We  get 
out, station sign says 
Niederorschel, and barking orders from an SS.
 A few words from Ger man fore ma n, translation 
by Hungarian interpreter. And then
 to my horror, the German fore ma n come s up to me and says, 
ﬁ Why are you here, I did not select you.ﬂ I was 
the one who escorted him in Auschwitz through 
the sel -- through 
the selection. 
Q: So he knew who you were. 
A: Yeah. So this was one thing th
at the kapos didn™t train me  for,
 and so I thought very fast and I 
said, ﬁWell sir, with this ma ny new m -- inma tes,
 they decided that you n
eed another interpreter 
and I was sent as an interpreter.ﬂ And he shrugge
d his shoulders and said okay. And we were left 
-- let into this -- 

Q: Now is th -- is this a German pri -- 
this is not a German
 prison. This is -- 
A: No, German civilian -- 

Q: -- civilian. 
A: -- forema n. 
Q: I see, okay. 

A: So Niederorschel was these tw
o [indecipherable] but now I know is
 a textile factory right next 
to a railroad siding and a plyw
ood factory further up, were enclos
ed as a camp, with a narrow 
walkway between them with barb wire fence. A
nd we were ma rched into this dining room and 
sat at tabl es and there was warm meal, which wa
s quite a shock. And we 
were all eating and the 
Hungarian interpreter and another guy who I was ve
ry close to later, came in, sat down, really 
crowding me on both sides. Who ar e you, where are you from, how come your clothes are 

different, how come  the fore ma n knew you? 

Q: You mus t  have been scared out of your mi nd. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
96 
 
A: Oh yeah, yes. I was very s -- I was very scar
ed. So I tried to explain myself. That evening I 
was taken into this little side room of wh
ere the two kapos lived, both German -- German 
political prisoners, both of them 
communists and in prison since 1933. 
Q: Oh my God, wow. 

A: Oh -- it -- in -- next
 month, in April, the 60
th
 anniversary of the liberation of Niederorschel, 
there™s a ceremony, including the Israeli ambassador 
to Germany. The kapo is -- kapo™s family is 
receiving a posthumous award as a 
Righteous Gentile, because only --
 only 19 people died there.  
Q: Really? 

A: Yup. And that was due entirely --
 entirely to him. So the quest -- 
Q: What -- what was his name ?  

A: Otto -- I™ll think of it in a mi
nute. I have the invitation from th
e ambas sador on -- on my desk. 
Otto -- no. 

Q: It™s okay. 
A: So, the questioning. The two kapos in Germa
n, a Gypsy who -- who was the camp orderly, I-I 
forget what language we -- we usually sp -- s
poke. Polish, a couple of 
the -- the labor orderly 
who was Cz ech, all crowding around me  and questio
ning me. And, so at -- at the end of that 
night, I convinced them. And I was only 13 years 
old, but I was accepted as -- as a full me mber 
of their resistance organization.  

Q: What -- what were they trying to fi -- wh
at -- why were they so suspicious of you? 
A: Once a plant, a pl
ant, a -- a -- a -- 
Q: A Ger ma n plant? 

A: A Ger ma n plant, a -- a [indecipherable] 
I mean, I did stick out like a sore thumb. 
Q: Because your uniform was so different. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
97 
 
A: Yeah. Yeah, so -- 
Q: But Tadek got this uniform in Aus c hwitz
 for you, I mean he just gave it to you. 

A: I mean, a collection of clothes, yeah. 

Q: So there™s a collection of clothes. 

A: Right, right. 

Q: So it can™t have been so unique. 

A: No, but it was bet 
-- better fitting, warmer. 
Q: I see. So you were bette
r prepared [indecipherable] 
A: I was better -- yup, right, right. 

Q: It™s also funny that they would susp
ect a 13 year old as
 being a plant.  
A: I don™t know, I don™t know. 

Q: I don™t know, it seems lik
e an odd plant to me. 
A: I don™t know, I m
ean, yeah right. 
Q: So how did -- I mean wi -- wa -- how di
d you convince them?  Just by being honest with 
them? 

A: Yeah. I told the Gypsy -- orderly wanted to k
now about the Gypsies, I 
said -- that was one of 
the very difficult things I reme mber. I told hi
m a -- what I had witnessed. This young Slovak Jew 
wanted to know about the wome n. I lied to him, but
 I -- I thought I had to
, and I answered all of 
their questions and I convinced them.  

Q: Okay, so now you™re one of them. 

A: Yes. 

Q: What does that mean? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
98 
 
A: Well, all right, let me tell you a little bit a
bout Niederorschel. Ther
e is the story -- okay, 
Niederorsc he l was a factory producing wings
 for Messershit -- schmitt fighter pl anes. 
Q: And Niederorschel is really 
a sub- camp of Buchenwald, right? 
A: It™s sub -- yeah, in 
Buchenwald, right, right. 
Q: So it™s in that ar ea. 
A: Yup. About 700 inmates, about 50 or 60 German
 civilian workers. 12 hour work shifts, six 
and a half days a week. Every 30 mi nutes the bell rings and the wing mo ves up on the assembly 

line from one station to the next
 station. That was the life. Food 
some what better than Auschwitz 
-- it™s better than Auschwitz. Fo
rtunately there was this absolute
ly first rate Czech cook. He was 
fat, he was really fat, who, I don™t know how hedid it. Kitchen scraps from the guard™s food, I™m 

sure table scraps from the guard™s food. Vegetables
 that the si -- the town crew ma naged to steal 
or whatever. He provided some  taste and some  vari
ety to the -- to the dail
y soup. So it was -- life 
was on the edge of being bearable, not quite. I sti
ll, after all of these years I think back with 
amaze me nt at what people in this circumst
ance still ma naged to do. Obviously there were 
shoema kers who could prepare your shoes with sole
 from discarded tires 
that the grounds crew 
found and shoe nails that were cut from scrap 
lumber. Obviously there were tailors who -- who 
with needle and thread gotten on the black ma rket
 from the -- from the civilians could fix your 
clothes. Those kinds of things you expect. You don™t expect to see these two brothers, Hungarian 

Jews deported from Hol l and, diamond grinders by 
trade, who ground prescription glasses out of 
bottoms of discarded milk bottles. Jewelers w
ho took scraps of aluminum from the plant and 
created these carved boxes that could be trade
d. Beautifully carved, el
aborately carved boxes. 
Some others made these very el
aborate boxes out of pleated s-stra
w that could be bartered with 
the -- with the German civilians for ne -- needle
, thread, soap, tobacco, 
few things. There were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
99 
 
about five or six -- ma ybe five to eight kids my age, mostly, as I said, Budapest with their 
fathers. One -- one kid I reme mber fr om Transylv
ania with his father. These gentleme n decided 
that our education could not be 
interrupted, so after 12 hours wor
kday, they sat us down, classes 
in algebra and French. Oh, everything, of c
ourse, was punishable by death, particularly 
smuggling o-out of the plant. Everybody who ha
d a opportunity smuggled out scrap aluminum, 
scrap tools, sharpening them into
 we apons at night. The lights we
nt out about half an hour after 
meals were served. You could hear for hours st
one bowl -- pebbles being scraped against me tal 
to create wa -- knives. I was very proud of a kni
fe I made for myself out of a -- a -- a hacksaw 

blade. There were -- of the 700, probably a hundr
ed were Soviet POWs. The Germans did not 
honor the Ge neva convention, and the Soviet POWs
 were in the same  boat as we were. And 

some  of them were the strongest, in terms of
 trying to make weapons. Training for a uprising. 
Throwing knives. Many of them had fashioned th
ese heavy knives with very heavy handles and 
practiced. 
Q: So there was real inten
tion to have an uprising? 
A: Yes. You asked about my role. First few week
s I was on -- on the detail with the -- under the 
Gypsy orderly that went to town to -- for collect 
-- for getting goods that 
-- bread and vegetables 
and that was brought in fr om the local ma rket. 
I was well enough dressed, if the other inma tes 
detracted the guards atten
tion, I could sn-sneak in the apothe
cary and with Reichsma rks from the 
black ma rket, get aspirin and me dication that the 
medic wanted; to get ethyl alcohol for Molotov 
bombs. 
Q: Ethyl alcohol for -- 

A: For Molotov cocktails.  

Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
100 
 
A: Then the SS lieutenant decide
d I was not strong enough to carry 
these loaves of bread, and so 
they put me  from that detail to the factory, and ne
xt to the Hungarian interpreter, the next to the 
last line on the assembly line, the inspection line. 
I was given a dentist mi rror, and it was my job 
to look at every single rivet to see that it wa
s properly driven. Badly -- o-occasionally -- I mean, 
sabotage was going all the time. Occas
ionally I would see a rivet that
 -- that wasn™t right. I coul d 
pass it, occasionally I could stop. 
Our station was the only one that
 could stop the assembly line 
to drill out a rivet and insert the explosive driv
en rivet, that you appl
y heat on the top and the 
bottom explodes and that tightens the -- the conn
ection. Whatever sabotage we could do, we -- 
we did. It didn™t really ma tter b
ecause it turns out -- well, eventu
ally, by January, the railroad 
line was bombed. We  were getting fe wer and fewer 
parts, and the wing -- the partial wings that 
we produced were piled in the s
now outside, was no place to put them
. The story I heard -- it™s th 
-- it™s known that no single wi
ng produced here ever flew. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah, the Germans made this a known -- the 
camp was only started in the spring of ™44. The 
Germans ma de this enormous effort to disp
erse war production because of the bombi ngs. And 
none o -- not all of it worked. In 
fact, I™ve heard a rumor that this was a ruse by a small group of 
people to -- to found this factory 
and escape from being drafted to 
the eastern front. How true it 
is, I don™t know. So -- so life was little bit more
 bearable, muc h more to do. Looking forward to 
that half day on Sunday afternoon where we had a 
little rest. Then as spring -- as weather became 
-- came to war -- warm up in -- in March, we 
would -- especially the Russians would set along 
the fence, which was the promenade to the to
wnspeople, and -- and si
ng Soviet songs loudly, 
which upset the promenade -- naders. That was th
e life. As I said, only 19 people died. Two were 
Soviet POWs that escaped, were brought back
 -- were captured by Ge
rman civilians, brought 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
101 
 
back and they were ha -- hanged. I have the list 
of the others, got it last  November. But mortality 
was -- was quite low -- were -- I me an, remarkably low. 
Q: These classes that  you talked about that  they said they were -- 

A: Yup. 

Q: When did -- when did they gi
ve you these classes, after work? 
A: After work.  

Q: After you eat? 

A: After you eat, yeah. 

Q: So how long would they last?  I mean, you must have -- 

A: Half an hour. 

Q: Half an hour. 

A: I mean, we were all asleep, but -- 

Q: I was -- 
A: -- we were all asleep by halfwa
y through, but I guess [indecipherable] 
Q: And you did the classes in the barracks? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And obviously these are a
ll verbal things you -- 
A: Right, oh yes, sure, yeah. 

Q: Did you learn anything? 

A: I don™t know. I -- I -- I was -- 
again, there was a fairly -- especi
ally if you have red -- yellow 
star, there was a fairly sharp di
vi ding line between the religious Je
ws and the secular Jews. I was 
a -- in the -- the room -- there was 
some  self selection, who went to
 what room. I wa s certainly in 
one of the rooms that was very s
ecular, but they -- the -- the re
ligious ferwer was -- was equally 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
102 
 
impressive. I mean, to know the entire daily and 
Sabbath prayer book by heart, I mean that™s for 
-- taken for granted. To know the parsha, the -- 
the week™s Torah portion and Aftorah portion by 
heart, well, there was always room for debate, 
th-the great Talmudic debates on -- on what was 
the correct me mory. All of the festivals are obser
ved, every -- I mean, yeah they -- they -- the 
Orthodox inma tes were totally imme rsed in -- in 
their religion. So we kne
w there -- most of the 
workers just sort of came and went as if we were
 invisible. You know, very little contact. One of 
them ev -- every day, would eat his lunch and read 
his paper and then ma ke sure that he got my 
eye and he ma de -- and signal on where he was hidi
ng the paper, so that later, just before we 
were herded back to the -- the ba
rracks, I could retrieve the paper 
and bring it in the barracks. So 
whatever the German ne wspaper said, we knew that. 
So, April first, we had just finished -- I -- I 
finished work is no longer ap-appropriate. We  
just finished our 12 hours and went back in the 
barracks, the whistle sounded and they were m
ovi ng -- moving us out. There was a big debate in 
the kapos rooms. Lot of people 
would -- lot of people wanted 
to stage an uprising. We  had 
counterfeit keys to all of the guards™ rooms. That
™s not eas -- not hard to do. The inma tes were -- 
were taking the -- the food across se
veral locked doors. With the ke
y you just chew some  -- some  
bread dough in your mo uth, ma ke an impression in
 the key and there were locksmith who could 

duplicate that. The SS, the officers were living upsta
irs, we didn™t think we 
could get to them. So 
there was a big debate and the kapo decided th
at -- that we didn™t know
 where the American 
front was. It seemed to have sl
owed down after the -- af
ter the Battle of the Bulge, that we would 
ma rch out. The kapo gave orders to the leaders of 
the brigades that everybody was free to escape 
if they could. The cook had some  e mergency ra
tions. Chicory grounds, mola
sses, something that 
you could carry, and we were ma rched out. 

Q: We re you disappointed th
at there was no uprising? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
103 
 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: You were? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You wanted to do it? 

A: Oh, I was -- well, yes, but when it came to th
e vote in the room, the Czech work orderly and I 
voting no swung the -- sw-swung the bala
nce. I could have voted for -- 
Q: And so why didn™t you? 

A: I didn™t think we had the -- the troops to do it. 

Q: Ah, so you™re distinguishing between wanting to do it -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but realizing 
that you were -- 
A: Yeah. I didn™t think we could do it. 

Q: How ma ny people do you think could have been
 involved?  How wa -- wa -- or were creating 
these weapons, of some kind? 

A: 150 out of 700, some thing like that. 

Q: And do you know about how ma ny guards you had? 

A: 40 - 50. 

Q: That™s a lot. 

A: Yeah. They were -- the officers were SS. The guards were Wehr macht, regular army 

reservists in their 40™s and 50™s and 60™s. I mean, 
tottering old me n, but still, they had automa tic 
rifles. 

Q: So that was the problem, of course. 

A: Yes, yeah. So that™s when -- that™s -- that™s how we got --

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494

Q: So -- well -- 
A: -- okay, so it™s -- 

Q: -- all right, so
 you all leave -- 
A: -- 10 day -- 10 days -- 

Q: 10 days of ma rching? 

A: -- of ma r c h -- let™s see, la -- in October we covered the same  route 
by car, probably two hours 
at 50 kilome t -- say it™s about 120 - 150 
kilome ters, less than a hundred miles. 
Q: And you™re ma rching towards -- 

A: Towards Buchenwald, yes, towards We imar -- 

Q: -- towards Buchenwald. 

A: -- right, right. Escapes almost every night, sh
ootings I™m -- I™m -- most every night. People 
falling behind shot and left to di
e in the -- left  dead in the -- in
 the gutter. Farmers watching us, 
standing in their fields, clutch
ing their pitchforks. Wa lking through these -- ma rching through 
these villages. People peering ou
t behind lace curs -- curtains
. We  went through Sonderheim, 
which was an only large city on the way, broken up 
cobblestone streets, a
nd that city had been 
bombed. So it was very long ma rch, very arduous. 
The follo -- we were being ma rched with the 
guards on the side, following the train -- following 
the ma rchers was a very old army truck, with 
a platform in the back, on which the relief guards 
slept, and it also carrie
d couple rows of a barb 
wire fence which they used to enclose every 
night. And pulled this, which was obviously World 
War  
1
 vintage field kitchen, which some ti me s work
ed and mo st of the time didn™t work, so 
some ti me s we had ersatz coffee or some  -- so
me thing resembling soup. Most of the time we 
didn™t.  

Q: So then, but there was an attempt? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
107 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: They didn™t just -- 

A: Right, right. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So after eight days we arrive
d at another satellite ca-camp cal
led Berlsteed, which some  of the 
old time prisoners recognized. That had been a br
ick factory which produced
 the -- the bricks for 
Buchenwald and for the other camps. So we had 
a little bit more fr eedom cause we™re inside the 
fence, inside the barb wire fence, and not the en
closure of rolls. And we 
had some food. We also 
found some  -- some  frozen potatoes on the groun
d and everybody started ma king fires and -- and 
grilling these potatoes and usually get -- taking 
them out barehanded before they were cooked. 
And suddenly we were called to a -- a second ap
pel. A contingent of SS guards came in a truck 
from -- from Buchenwald, replaced our We hr ma ch
t guards, and these offi
cers took count. In the 
officer™s staff car was an inma te, and even it 
was dusk I could recognize 
first the red triangle on 
his chest, and the red be ret on his he ad. So as dusk was falling and the officers were chatting, I 

inched up to him. The guar -- the -- the -- the ka
po was sitting on the r
unning board of the SS 
staff car and I inched up to him and sort of crouc
hed without looking at him, as -- as if there was 
no contact. And he said, ﬁDo you speak Polish?
ﬂ Yes. ﬁYou have a resistance group?ﬂ Yes. 
ﬁSend me  one of them.ﬂ  All I could say is, ﬁ
I™m one of them, you can talk.ﬂ And he said, 
ﬁ Whatever you do, stall. Buchenwald is being emp
tied, trainloads of Jewi
sh prisoners are -- are 
being taken -- taken in open cars. We  don™t kno
w what™s happening, we don™t have control.ﬂ The 
re-resistance organization in Buchenwald was alwa
ys very strong. ﬁWe don™t have control, stall.ﬂ 
So I shuffled back to the -- actually I ran back
 because a SS sergeant was kicking at me , ran back 
and when we were bedded down, I reported thatto the kapo and the -- the others. How do we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
108 
 
stall? And this Czech governme nt bureaucrat 
who was a high level -- I think he was deputy 
secretary of some thing in Czech Republic, he re
alized what we had to do, that the SS took e -- 
that up to that point the local 
SS were in charge, they could do
 whatever they wanted. Now a 
count had been taken up to Buchenwald, our SS ha
d to deliver that ma ny bodies, dead or alive 
when they arrive in Buchenwald. There™s no -- 
no question. So if some  people would hide, the 
count would come  short. We ll the -- the Gypsy 
orderly had been in -- in bel -- Berlsteed, he 
knew where the brick ovens were, and it was decide
d that three of -- he 
and two others would 
hide in the brick ovens at 
night. We  woke up, our kapo -- our -- SS took a head count, it was 
three short. So they were thr -- dispatching peop
le all -- all -- guards all over to search, we just 
stood at attention for a good part of the day. 
They he -- the SS lieutenant singled out the 
organization, he knew everybody. Others were allo
wed to -- to sit, to lie down, we we re 
standing. He threatened to start killing us. Nothin
g happened. He s -- that™s when he sent all but 
four to six guards for another search. And that 
was when I thought that th
ey -- he -- that Vladya, 
Russian off-officer would yell one word and the 
breakout would start. I knew that. Facing the 
guards were all the -- the sharps
hooters with their heavy knives. A
nd I expected that those people 
would -- would kill the guards and get their guns
 and s -- and face the other guards comi ng back. 
And then, for the first time that I recall, we hear
d the sound of -- of gunfire from the west. I -- I 
don™t recall having it er -- having 
heard it earlier. I don™t know how 
-- how far the front was, I -- 
I never checked. I could check by date on wher
e the front was. But anyhow, the SS chickened 
out, and decided to ma rch us out. Long, tortur
ous, very difficult walk up the steep slope. 
Buchenwald means beech forest, and the camp is at 
the tip of this some what sizable hill. The SS 
ma de the resistance group ma rch in front and SS 
officer behind us and then rest of them. The 
inma tes -- and it was definitely silence, a
nd everybody was shuffling, and I decided I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
109 
 
some thing to -- I had to do some thing, and I stoppe
d as if to tie my shoe, and turned around and 
yelled pasnia in Russian, a song. And the Russians heard me  and pretty soon the entire column 
was singing. And that was a tremendous relief
. Me -- I mean, we all we -- on Sundays, the 
Sunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs,
 Polish partisan songs, Yiddish songs. Never 

Hungarian songs. Nobo -- nobody Hungarian wanted
 anything Hungarian. We  were singing 
elements of -- of the chor al move me nt of the 
Nint h Symphony, because that
 was a -- one of the 
musicians from the Budapest orch
estra taught it to us. So that 
singing started and that some how 
got people the -- the strength to march the last 
couple of kilometers up -- uphill, and we arrived 
at the ga te in Buchenwald. 

Q: You remember the song that you sang -- th
at you started to sing, this Russian song? 
A: [speaks Russian here] A Russian folk song, 
the -- the Volga -- the Vo
lga boatman song, some 
partisan songs.  

Q: So that gave everybody a -- 
A: That -- that was a -- a big lift.
 So we arrive at the gate of 
Buchenwald, which was described to 
me  by the people who had been there, and we 
marched in. First thing I noticed that the 
crematorium, the chimney was -- was cold, there was no smoke comi ng out of the chimney, 
which I thought was a good sign. We  were ma rched 
through the sanitation de
lousing area right at 
the top, and that was a good sign. And we were faced
 by a group of -- of political prisoners in the 
red beret comi ng to me e t  us. On that day there were no more transports out, there were no more 

SS inside the camp, and the resistance organi
zation controlled the camp. So -- so we were 
ma rched in one of the barracks and told to go to
 sleep, and I fell asleep. 
And I don™t have a very 
heroic closing because next thing I reme mber
 is in following day at mi d-afternoon, some body 

shook my shoulder to say that 
the Americans were there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
110 
 
Q: Did it feel like the end of this hell? 
A: Yeah, in many ways it did. We all raced up to th
e -- to the barb wire fence, we yelled, and I 
tried to catch some body™s attenti
on and report on the -- on the crim
es of the SS lieutenant that I 
knew of, and then I collapsed against the fence.
 Spent six weeks in a 
field hospital run by the 
American army. 

Q: And the field hospital wa
s on the site? On the -- 
A: Ah -- buchenw -- you™ve not been to Buchenwald. 

Q: Yeah, on top. 

A: On top. The camp is that side, on the other side
 is the crescent of th
ese large buildings which 
were SS barracks, which now house the museum, 
library, etcetera. In 24 hours, Americans 
converted that to one field hosp
ital, recruiting nurses and docto
rs from [indecipherable] I don™t 
know how ma ny thousand of people were there. So I was there for -- 

Q: Six weeks. 
A: -- six weeks. 
Q: We re you awake a lot of this ti
me , or were you [indecipherable] 
A: I was awake [indecipherable] uh-huh, yup. 

Q: And wha t  was wrong with you at this point? 

A: Dehydration, broken arm -- 

Q: Broken arm?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Where™d that come from? 

A: Oh, that came from one of the guards. I spoke 
back to him and he swung his rifle at me  and I -
- I -- the only time I lost my -- my 
cool, spoke back to the armed guard. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
111 
 
Q: When did this happen? 
A: On the march. 

Q: Oh, on the ma rch. So you™re ma rching with a broken arm?  

A: Yeah, with a -- with a -- yeah. The me dic -- 
the Russian offi cer cut some  -- cut some tree 
limbs and made a s -- they ma de a splint, me dic 
made a splint and I was 
walking with a ar --  
marching with a broken arm.  

Q: He could have shot you. 

A: Oh yeah, yeah.  

Q: Do you have any idea why he didn™t? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: No, you don™t know. He just broke your arm. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: He s mashed you with it -- with a baton? 
A: With -- swung his rifle and 
-- and I just put my  arm up. 
Q: Oh. We ll, I™m glad you told me .  
A: Yeah. So I don™t know how far beyond you want to go. 

Q: I want to go a ways down. So you
™re in the hospital for six weeks. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And you know that your mother is not alive? 

A: I didn™t know that -- I mean, yes, I knew th
at from my sister. I kne
w what -- I didn™t know 
about my sister, I didn™t know about my father.  

Q: Your father, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
112 
 
A: While I was there in the hospital, a rabbi fr
om the Backa area came  by. He -- he was taking 
names of liberated inmates from the Backa area,
 and came to interview me. I said ah sa -- 
Subotica. Da te of birth -- 16 -- April 1929 and s 
-- s -- wait a mi nute. He goes through notebooks 
and says, you have a twin. So he had me t -- seen 
my sister in Bergen-Bel
sen, and so that™s how I 
knew that she was there. She was alive. So yea
h, the Iron Curtain was down in ™45. Not -- didn™t 
wait for Truman -- for Churchill™s speech. The French, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians 
were out of there in 48 hours. The people who wa
nted to go to the Soviet
 side were there for 
weeks and weeks and weeks. I was informed when 
I regist ered with the American -- that there 
was a provision for DP orphans to be sent directly to the States. And they notified my  uncle who 

was a doctor in -- in New York, that they found 
me. And my ga -- my uncle would take me  -- 
and I said no, I can™t do that. 

Q: This is the brother of your mother? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Right?  Okay. 
A: I said, ﬁI have to go back. If
 anybody is alive, they will do -- 
will do the same  thing, I have to 
go back.ﬂ So it wasn™t til July or August that we
 were taken by American
 trucks to Pilsen in 
Czechoslovakia and then by train, Pilsen, Pra
gue, Budapest. And I ar
rived in Subotica. 
Q: And had you all said this to each othe
r, as a family, that we™ll go back -- 
A: Never said it, never said it. 

Q: You never said where you would go? 

A: No. We  j ust knew that.  

Q: So did you go back to your house? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
113 
 
A: At the railroad st ation, my two surviving 
cousins were waiting for me . They were in the 
Yugoslav army, and they were comi ng out daily,
 whenever a returning train was comi ng, they 
did that  regularl y. So we went to our -- my Gen
tile aunt™s house. Going back to my house made 
no sense. So I stayed there. Couple weeks later 
my sister came  back 
omai -- on a train from 
Bergen-Belsen. And then in late August, ma ybe early September, my fa ther came  ba ck on a 

Russian hospital train. Istill have the admi ssion diagnosis from the Russian mi  -- military 

hospital. Angina, kidney failure, 15 serious ma ladies
, from a coal mi ne in Silesia. But he came 
home . He tried to start a new life. He was told th
at if he asked for the plant they™re going to try 
him for collaboration with the enemy because he
 didn™t put up armed resistance when the plant 
was taken away. He eked out a mi serable livi
ng, and he died sixth 
of February, 1946. Three 
months after he came back. Tota
lly broken, physically, emotionally. 
Q: So he wasn™t the same  ma n that you knew? 

A: Uh-uh. One picture that I don™t have in my albu
m -- most of the pictures I have in my album -
- my sister it was bet -- had better connections, go
t more pictures back, and mo -- large majority 
of what I have is -- is photocopies from her albu
m. There is this small passport size picture of our 
father, I don™t want a copy of that
 in my album. I t ™s so horrible th
at I don™t want it. But at least 
we could bury him in this big, elaborate tomb that
 was put up for his brother. My wife, Nor ma is 
n -- Novemb er, this October was the first 
time  that she wa -- she had seen some body 
[indecipherable] and of course we went to th
e ceme tery. And she said, ﬁYou had sow -- shown 
me this picture before,ﬂ it™s a big, white marb
le thing with [indecipherable] and projecting 
letters. But on a photograph it™s -- 
they™re almost invisible. And th
en underneath, carved in very 
crudely are the names of my father and all the 
relatives who died in the Shoah. Then my wife 
said, ﬁThis solves one mystery. I could never 
bring up myself to ask you, but I could never 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
114 
 
understand how, in those circumstances you could afford to have such a fa ncy grave for your 
father.ﬂ She never realized that
 that was a -- the tomb f -- for 
my uncle. So after he died -- 
Q: Is your mother™s name up there, too? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So all the fa mily me mbers who died -- 

A: All the family me m -- yeah -- 

Q: -- whether they™re there or not. 

A: -- a -- a -- through the entire
 cemetery, everywhere, there are th
e -- the name s of 
t he -- of the -
- you know, one engraved name  on t he name  and 20 
chiseled in name s of sur -- of people who 
didn™t survi -- of people w
ho died. So, went back to school, I™d lost a year. 
Q: And whe r e are you living? 

A: We got this apartment, which was a terrib -- 

Q: You and your sister? 
A: Well, first my father -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and I and sister. We had a terrific ma i
d, a Volksdeutscher, a [indecipherable] woma n who 
was let out of the camps to be 
our servant until they were booted 
out to Germany. All -- all they -
- all the Volksdeutscher were -- from mo -- all 
of these countries were
 booted out. You know, the 
-- the German -- the German foreign mi nister™s 
name  is the same  as my nickname , Joschka. 
Q: Really? Oh that™s right, yes it was. 

A: Yeah. I mean ob -- obviously his fa mily came  from
 -- fr -- came from -- was expelled in the -- 
at the end of the war. So we had this mi serable 
apartment, cold, with my father, and until she was 

deported, this -- this woma n, w
ho was quite, quite nice. And then my -- my younger aunt -- my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
115 
 
three younger so -- aunts -- my father™s three you
nger dau -- sisters survived, two of them in 
Budapest and one in -- in Subotica and she move d 
in with us. And that was it, we -- I mean, 
going to school in communist Yugoslavia was no 
fun at all. You know, obligatory me mbership 
in the communist youth party and 
I was there -- I -- I™m very grat
eful. I still corr
espond with two 
of my classmates who s ort of pick me  up and pr
ovide a lot of support. So
 I did two years there. 
And my sister came back on a train with 
ma ny Yugoslav army officers comi ng from POW 
camps, and she was corresponding with one of them
, who wr ote back -- wrot
e her that he had a 
position in the foreign ministry. I went to Belgra
de, we saw him and he issued us passports and 
exit visas. I™m not quite sure it was legal for hi
m to do so. But of all of us, two of us, my two 
cousins, and my two cousins fiancés, of the six of
 us who found ourself together in Paris, we 
were the only two that had 
legal ways of getting there. 
Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. Did anybody, when you came  back and you™re going to school, 

you™re there for a c
ouple of years -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- before you leave for Paris, yes? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Does anybody ask you what happened?  Do you talk
 to your sister, is th
ere -- or do you just 
simply go on? 

A: No, there was a lot of talk, there --  there was 
a -- a friend of my aunt™s who invited me  to talk, 
who i m -- who told me  that I have to sit dow
n and write all of this
 down. Yeah, some  people 
were interested. The ma jority -- I mean, all of us 
-- most of us  just want
ed to get on and let -- 
Q: Did you -- so you didn™t want to 
talk?  This was not some thing -- 
A: Oh, I -- I talked to them. I 
me  -- when people asked, I talked. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
116 
 
Q: Right. 
A: But I didn™t want to dwell too much on it. 

Q: Right. And your sister the same? 

A: Yeah, me  -- much mo re so than I. 

Q: More so than you? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean she -- 
she had ter -- totally divorced hers
elf, she -- she said she didn™t 
want to have anything to 
do with it. I mean, she -- 
Q: Did you talk together so she knew what 
happened to you and you knew what happened to 
her?  

A: Yeah, yeah. I -- 

Q: But that was it? 

A: That was it. So -- 

Q: So you went to -- 
A: -- so -- so we escaped. I mean, in -- with a
ll --  in -- with all resp
ects, we escaped. If -- 
Q: We re there any questions at 
the border with these papers? 
A: We ll, we were very careful. On the basis of 
Yugoslav passport, French -- Americans were not 
very helpful. ﬁOh, you missed your chance as a DP
. There is a Yugoslav quota, but it™s kept in 
the west. If you ma nage to get the west and re
gister, we™ll register 
you.ﬂ Period. French were 
very nice, ﬁWe™ll give you a three day transit 
visa, if [indecipherable] you get to France, the 
police will extend it indefinitely if you renounce your 
citizenship.ﬂ On the ba
sis of that we go to 
Italians, 24 hour transit visa. 
You wait, th -- Tr ieste was 
being run by [indecipherable] 
arrangements. You certainly don™t go the month 
when the Russians control it. You don™t go the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
117 
 
month when the British control it,
 because they read stuff. You wait til the Americans control it, 
they put a stamp on it -- 
Q: Then you just go. 

A: Then you just go. The train -- in Lj ubljana th
e train was locked. The train was unlocked when 
we got to Milan. And from there we went to Pari
s. I usually break down when I talk about that. I 
came back ma ybe a doz en time to the Milan trai
n station, going to Florence, going conferences 
in northern Italy. But that™s really th
e place where I feel my fr eedom began. 
Q: In Milan? 

A: Just a railroad station, hour of waiting 
for the train to Pari
s. But that was -- 
Q: That™s the place. 

A: That™s the place.  

Q: We  have to stop the tape. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape Seven

Q: I know it™s hard to reme mber feelings. Did you actually feel when you were in Milan that this 
was the break -- 

A: Oh yes. Very strongly. 

Q: You did feel -- 

A: Very strongly. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And whe n you go back there, you feel [indecipherable] 

A: Oh yeah, right. 

Q: And did es --  

A: And my sister™s comment is, ﬁYou were a 
good little boy until then, you haven™t been one 
since.ﬂ 
Q: And you™re still a little boy to her? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: So from Milan, you go into Paris. 

A: We  get to Paris, we registered with the Jo
int, American Joint Distribution Committee, they 
provided housing and -- and meal tickets at a caf
eteria. We nt to the Yugoslav consulate, asked 
for a interview with the consul, we walked i
n, handed him the passport -- two passports, and 
walked out, went to the Yugoslav royal military
 mi ssion. They gave us a -- a certificate. 
Q: That said what, you™
re no longer citizens? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
119 
 
A: That -- that we are recognized
 by them, whatever that was. 
Q: Okay. 
A: We nt to the French police pr efecture, got our
 three month visitor -- a three months permit. 
Went to the arrondissement headqua
rters, got our ni -- our rations
, it was still rationed. And the 
fren -- I mean, the stay was extended for two y
ears. Every three months we  had to go to police 
for an extension. Visited England the following year
, and then c-comi ng to the States I had -- we 
both had [indecipherable] stateless 
passports issued by the French. 
Q: And you went to school in Fr
ance, did you not?  Both of you? 
A: Well, at first -- at first al -- 
Joint had thousands of us, so they contracted out to French social 
service agencies to take care of
 groups of people, and we were -- we were at a outfit called 
Service sociale des jeunes. Youth social services
. And that™s where we went monthly for money, 
some  clothing, I mean, really subsistence money,
 clothing, meal tickets, etcetera. There was 
nothing else to do. There™s this 
great institution called Alliance 
Française, which gives free 
French lessons -- free lessons in French three 
days a week, morning sessions, afternoon session, 
evening session. Allowed to progress as fast as y
ou™re ready. I went through three sessions a day, 
had nothing else to do. And so I 
-- the next year, I™m now a pr
oud owner of a certificate that 
allows me  to teach French as a second language al -- any- anywhere outside of France.  

Q: So that was your fourth language? 

A: Yes. 

Q: At least. 

A: That™s my fourth language. There was this great 
urge that we all should learn a trade. I ne -- I 
know social workers who -- handling DP persons in 
this country, and always that same  urge. So 
they put us into this school, e-
electrician school, ma jorly ma ke-shi ft sort of thing. The directress 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
120 
 
-- the -- Madame  le Directeur of the social serv
ice agency thought I coulddo better. She used her 
personal cont acts, and I got accepted in a priv
ate hi gh school. Of course [indecipherabl e] you 
know, one of the governme nt lycées never take some body like that. She got me  into a private 
school. She got her octogenarian former teacher to 
coach me . And in ™49 I passed the first part of 
the French baccalauret and in ™
50 I pa ssed the second part. How did I do it?  My French teacher 
said -- the -- the nice thing about the French
 baccalauret is that it™s admi nistered by the 
universities, not by the high schools, so nobody 
knows you. He said, ﬁYou™v
e got to establish 
right away that French is not 
your native language. Make a atrocious colloquial error in the first 
sentence. And after that, do the best that you can.ﬂ So -- 

Q: And it was -- was that because  they would be sympathetic? 

A: Yeah. I mean, they would understand that it™s not
 my native language. So that™s what I did in 
the first year in French, second year ma th -- 
I me an, ma th I was okay. And physics, chemistry, 

etcetera. Se -- yeah, first year th
ere™s a written -- written foreign 
language and a second oral only. 
That year I took English because 
I had a little bit more sc-schooling in English than I had had in 
French -- in German. Se cond year it™s only an 
oral exam, so I took Germa n. Exam wa s running 
late, I was the last one and I -- I was totally exhaus
ted, I just propped mys e lf in there, in front of 
the examiner, and in German I said, ﬁWass soll ic
h übersetzen? ﬂ  What is it that you want me  to 
translate?  He said, ﬁThat™s it.ﬂ He
 closed the books, and I passed. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. I was beginning t -- m- my  s-sister a
nd I were both beginning to
 think about staying 
there -- 

Q: Staying? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
121 
 
A: -- staying in France, yeah. She was start -- sh
e started with the Sorbonn
e, I was thinking about 
which preparatory school I would take
 in the fall to -- to get into 
one of the architecture schools. 
And then the American visa
 arrived in August of 1950. 
Q: And you had applied for a visa? 
A: Yeah, yes, we registered with a -- but
 yugos -- Yugoslav quota and then there was the 

McCarran Act -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- which said let™s start from scratch, throw 
away all the accumulate
d quotas that were not 
exercised during the war. Yugoslav quota is 400 
year or something like that, but it wasn™t 
exercised since ™41. I would ha -- you know, if Tr
uman hadn™t vetoed that I would never have 
been here. In between we tried various places wh
ere we could go, with our two cousins and that 
didn™t work out, because we had affidavits from 
my uncle on the ma ternal side. They eventually 
wound up in Venezuela and we came to the St ates. 
So we went to Chicago because that™s where 
our uncle lived. 

Q: Wait, let me -- hold it for a second. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you like being in Paris, in Fr ance? 

A: Oh, tremendously. 

Q: It was -- 

A: I mean, we lived -- I mea
n, mi serably. You know, I -- when I went -- on weekend you decide 
whether to use your money to eat or to go to the -- 
the weekly visit 
to the se -- to the public baths 
to -- to take a shower. You know, 
it™s a different level of living 
than -- than what you norma lly is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
122 
 
-- are accustomed to. But -- but it was great, I mean, 
yeah, I mean every other -- in most respects 
it was great. 
Q: Did you feel like orphans? 

A: I was the token refugee in this high school
 which was very upper cl
ass French high school. I 
mean, several of my classmate™s fathers were st
ill in pr ison for -- for their role in the Vichy 
governme nt. I felt very well accepted. 

Q: You did? 

A: Yes.  

Q: But the two of you are still children, in
 a way. Your sister is what, 16 - 17? 
A: Seven -- yeah. 

Q: And you™re 15? 

A: Right. Well, it didn™t ma tter. 

Q: Didn™t matter? 
A: No, no. We were quite self-sufficient. My 
-- I no longer keep conta -- I kept contact for a 
couple decades with my  classmates from high school. You know, the -- the number of people 
who passed the baccalauret is exactly equal to th
e number of openings in the university at the 
following fall. So they consider me as a traitor 
to France for having dropped out of that. And I™ve 

often thought what it would have been. I mean, 
there™s no question in my mi nd if I™d become  a 
professor at the Ecole Superieu
re des Ponts et Chaussee, in 
relative terms that would be 
some thing higher than being a prof
essor at Carnegie Me
llon University. But th
e -- the odds of a 
foreigner getting that far in France,
 it™s sort of near zero. So I 
-- I -- I don™t -- never regretted it. 
Q: So you came to the United States. 

A: Came to the United St ates. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494

Q: And was your uncle, your moth
er™s brother in Chicago? 
A: He was a -- well, he had a practice in -- in 
New York, he contacted Multiple Sclerosis, and 
decided that the best way to heal
 himself is to heal others, and 
gave up his practice, moved to a 
veteran™s hospital in Chicago as
 a -- as a physic
al therapist. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. But he was not in a position to support 
us. He died -- yeah, I think I introduced Nor ma 
to him once, he me t my wife-to-be once. There we
re some  other friends of my parents, who were 
terrific. Took us over and sort of nurtured us
 and I got -- I was di
sin -- by that time I was 
absolutely disenchanted with ar
chitecture but I decide
d I would study civil engineering. I started 
na -- 

Q: So your original in
tent was architecture? 
A: Yeah, there™s a expectation of
 my parents, because of -- 
Q: Because of your -- 
A: -- of my uncle™s prominence. But at Beaux Ar ts --
 I -- I™ m still --  I™ m sure that  if I™d started at  
a decent, modern architecture school I would have
 stayed. But in the Beaux Arts, the first year 
there™s only one subject, free ha
nd sketching, nothing else. And 
I passed the ma the ma tics option 
of the baccalaureate. I wa nted to do some  other 
things beside  free hand sketching. So that was 
out. So a friend of -- our friend in Chicago sugge
sted that I wa s not qualified to work as a 
draftsma n. I didn™t know the English units, among 
other things, but at that time engineering 
drawings still had to be traced in ink on -- on ve
llum. So I got a ma -- job as a -- as a tracer. 
Eventfully they promoted me  to draftsma n, th
at™s -- was fine. I star
ted night school at IIT 
[indecipherable] technology in Chicago. And I had a pa
th laid out and in seven and a half years I 
would have my bachelor™s degree. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494

Q: Working at night? 
A: Working at night. Except that in January ™
52, 15 months after I came  to the States, I got 
drafted in the United States Army, because I ca
me  as a -- with my intention of becomi ng a 
citizen, so I was qualified for the draft. 

Q: But you weren™t a citizen yet. 

A: No, but -- but my -- 

Q: But they can still dr aft you? 

A: The intent -- the green ca -- th
e -- the cert -- the certificate of
 intent, or whatever you sign, 
qualify -- 

Q: Qualifies you to be drafted. 

A: -- ma kes you subject to the draft, yes. Korea --
 not to citizenship because the Korean war was 

not a declared war, so peace time  rules applied. A
nd peace times rules are, after three years in the 
continental -- three years of se
rvice in the continental United 
States, you qualify for citizenship. 
Well, people were drafted for two years, not three,  and they were sent overseas. That™s why they 

were drafted. And then, in Korea, the Chinese cap
tured a few kids in my situation. At least one 
of them was  -- was taken back to 
-- to Wa rsaw and paraded on the st
reets of Wa rsaw as a traitor. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. At which point congress passed the 
wartime regulations, afte
r 180 days without -- 
without a dishonorable discharg
e you qualify. And so everybody in
 Korea in one weekend -- a 
federal judge was flown to Tokyo, all of these kids
 were pulled out and sworn in in one weekend. 
Q: As citizens. 

A: As citizens. In -- in the European sector we we
re just told that we qualify as soon as we get 
out. So anyhow, I had basic training, 
I had orders to Korea, blanket orders to Korea, which ma de 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
125 
 
me wonder what it will be like to 
have a weapon to shoot back. La
st mi nute I was -- a few of us 
were pulled out and sent to Eu
rope -- sent to Germany as 
interpreters. So I arrived in 
Bremerhaven, arrive in Stuttgar t, intel -- intell
igence battalion attached to the sevent h army 
headquarters, after four or five weeks of doi ng nothing, the executive offi
cer calls me  in and 
says, ﬁSoldier, we can™t get you clearance.ﬂ 
Obviously they couldn™
t check in Yugoslavia 
[indecipherable]. Security status 
-- ﬁwithout a clearance, you -- we can™t use you in this battalion. 
The norma l procedure under these 
circumstances is to send you back to infantry. You look a 
little bit more intelligen
t than that, what else can you do? ﬂ And 
I -- I said, ﬁ Well, sir, in attempt 
to be a civil engineer I also passed the drafts
man test, not just  the language test.ﬂ He called 
across seventh army headquarters, engineer sec
tion, oh yeah, they need draftsme n. And so for a 
year and a ha lf I was a --  
Q: A draftsma n. 

A: A draftsma n. In a fe w weeks I got promoted and I was chief draftsma n. So that was a very 
interesting lesson because the first time I was re
sponsible for other people™s work, which was 
interesting. Being stationed in St
uttgart was interesti
ng. I me t two or three -- two other guys that 
sim -- situation very similar to a -- to mi ne. On
e of the very inexpensive entertainments was the 
opera. One -- four ma rks , one dollar, running 10 
months a year, and so you know, twice a week, 
three times a week we would go to the opera
. There were a lot of young German me n and 
wome n wor king in various positions at army hea
dquarters. I s-sort of became part of the group. 
Mit -- at that time it was still an army  of occupa
tion, you couldn™t wea -- wear
 civilian clothes. It 
didn™t ma tter, I -- I me t this girl, I kept my cl
othes at her -- her house. I would change, we would 
go out to dinner, and get changed and get back
 on the last bus at mi
dnight going up to army 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
126 
 
headquarters. If I was -- whenever I was challenged by the MPs in restaurants, I spoke better 
German -- better German than they did, I -- I wa
s ne -- I was never caught. I never -- never -- 
Q: So they thought you were a German?  

A: Yes, I had this -- there was 
a Hungarian laborer in the kitchen 
at the -- at the -- at the army 
headquarters and he would lend me  his -- his 
I.D. [indecipherable] 
car -- I.D. card and 
[indecipherable] MPs didn™t faze me . 

Q: They didn™t faze you, no? 

A: No, no. 

Q: You figured they can™t be worse 
than what you already went through, huh? 
A: Right, right. So it was a very interesting expe
rience because several of these kids wanted to 
talk about what happened and what they -- what 
their parents role was, and what happened to 
their parent s, and I was very much interested in
 what their parents role was, and what happened 
to their parents. So we had very long c
onversations with -- week
end long conversations. 
Q: We re you honest about yourself? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You were? 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: And they were very interested to know --  

A: Absolutely, yes, yes. 

Q: -- how this connection was? 

A: Yes, I was -- absolutely. Yup. Certainly that wa
s a very -- intellectually 
very interesting part. 
The other part is that with the leave I had -- a
nd -- and money, I had opportunity to travel. One 
thing I forgot to me ntion about my childhood is that
 this room that was my mother™s studio and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
127 
 
our play space, on four walls, th
ree rows of black and white repr
oductions of -- of artwork, most 
-- mostly renaissance, mostly classical, very few 
modern ones. I was raised with that. So over the 
years, but certainly starting with
 the period, I must have seen a
ll the originals by 
now. My sister 
and I couple times have started to ma ke a list 
and we always stop, because the list gets aha -- 
longer, and longer, and longer of things we thin
k should -- that should have been there, which 
weren™t there. But, you know, going to Berlin, to
 the Dali museum to see the [indecipherable] 
which with the -- the owl [indecipherable], yup, th
at™s -- that™s part of
 my -- my traveling 
schedule anywh -- anywhere I go. So 
I got out of the army. I got ear
ly discharge so I could start 
at the Univer sity of Il linois. I st arted February
 ™54, got my Bachelors in February ™57. In the 
meanti me I met Nor ma, we got married. 50
th
 anniversary is comi ng up in three months.  
Q: Where did you meet? 

A: In Chicago. My sister and her sister-in-
law met through a common fri e nd and they had both 
had children of the same age. Her sister-in- la
w was born in Vienna, sent on a kindertransport 
first to England, and from there to -- fa mily went to Latin America before they came to the 

States. And so we got married in ™55. 

Q: And she™s American? 

A: She™s American. First son was born in 
™57. I was valedictoria
n of the ™57 class. 
Q: That™s quite an accomplishment. Same  year, huh? 

A: Yup. Commence ment speaker was the junior
 senator from Massachusetts, John Kennedy. I 
didn™t -- I wanted to design su
spension bridges, I didn™t -- 
Q: You wanted to design
 suspension bridges -- 
A: Yeah, that™s -- I mean -- 

Q: -- that  was the thing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
128 
 
A: -- that was the thing. I didn™t th
ink about s-staying in academia, 
but I -- I got it -- I had very 
good record, I got a fellowship for the first year
 of graduate study, departme nt [indecipherable] 
offered me a instructor ship for the sec -- for the 
succeeding years. So in se ven and a ha lf years, I 
had my Ph.D.. Never paid a penny for it, because  
I was on the G.I. bill, and then the Illinoi s 
Veterans scholarship [indecipherable] so I never 
had -- I never had to pa
y tuition. And so I -- I 
stayed in academia all my life. 
One -- one serious consideration fo
r one -- to work in company in 
New York, but other than th
at, I stayed in academia. 
Q: Now, did Nor ma work while you were getting your Ph.D.? 
A: Nor ma worked until Gregory was born in ™57. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we were never as well off as when I -- I 
was a graduate student, a
nd I had a -- the -- the 
small a mount from G.I. bill, and the stipend. I m
ean, we neve r lived as we ll within our means as 
we did then. 
Q: Really? 
A: Oh yes, yes, I mean -- campus ti me -- you co
uld go to concerts for a pittance, and -- and I 
mean, we had a -- a gr eat life. So I became an in
structor. I did be -- th
en things slowed down 
because I was working full time , I didn™t get my Ph.D. til ™61, when I was 30. But I was full 

professor by ™65, in four years.  

Q: That™s amazing. 

A: And so I -- I had a very, very
 satisfactory career. 
I got into computingvery early. Took my 
first -- my one and only programmi ng course
 in ™57. Machine language programmi ng. But I 
affected personally -- had a grea
t affect on how structural engi
neers earn their living by taking 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
129 
 
part of the dull hand tracking computations o
ff their -- off their hands and putting -- and 
substituting computer programs for t hat. So I -- 
Q: Did you ever build a suspension bridge? 

A: No, I never -- no -- 

Q: Does that ma ke you unhappy? 

A: -- I -- I -- I worked -- I work
ed part time before -- a-as a first year graduate student, and I 
designed a little -- tiny lit
tle county bridge, 20 foot span and th
at -- I was very proud of that and -
- and a few time s when we wer -- went back to 
Illinoi s, I actually dr ove 
out to look and see how 
it was faring. 

Q: 20 foot. 

A: 20 foot span, very -- 

Q: That™s pretty ni ce. 

A: Yeah, tha-that™s -- 
Q: It™s sweet. 
A: Yeah, but not -- my c olleagues were -- two 
of my good friends were on the -- working on the 

Messina St rait crossing, you know, I di
d -- never did anything like th
at. But -- but I dare to say 
that very few structur es built that have not 
been designed with the tool s that I st arted. 
Q: And prior to what you were doin
g, people were doing everything by hand -- 
A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: -- trying to figur
e out everything.  
A: I mean, as an undergraduate this was drille
d into it, that our chance of -- our livelihood 
depended on how efficiently we coul
d do this hand cranking procedure. 
Q: And you just said [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
130 
 
A: We ll, I wa -- I was very fortunate, I -- as a 
young instructor, I -- no, you
ng assistant professor, 
I had a chance to work one summer a t  IBM, and I 
got introduced to some  very useful theory and 
then I had a year™s leave of absence at MIT a
nd I had some  good colleagues to work with and I 
had a chance to -- to do some thing in very short or
der. My -- my claim to fa me  was fi nished in 
™63, have been downhill ever since. 

Q: I doubt it. 

A: But -- but 38 Ph.D. students -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- first in ™72 we moved to Carnegie-Mellon. 
I went there as departme nt head. I thought, you 
know, no big deal. Year and a half later I had a 
horrible, totally debilit
ating nervous breakdown. 
I couldn™t handle promotion cases, 
tenure cases, lab technician firing cases. A psych -- psych -- a 
psychic-cologist --  psychi atrist  and -- kept me
 on pills, which ma de me  fu nction okay, but he 

didn™t help, he was a pure Freudi
an. He said, ﬁHow old were 
you? ﬂ I said 13. He said, ﬁIt™s 
impossible that some thing that old -- at that 
age could have ever aff
ected you.ﬂ So one day it 
became so severe that Norma didn™t trust me to 
go by myself and she came with me to -- to the 
shrink. The way -- the reason I connected with him 
because I went to th 
-- asked the rabbi and 
the rabbi recommended him, the guy™s practice wa
s marital conflict, and s -- i -- many times I 
would say some thing, what does Norma think?  She™
s -- the same  thing that I do, sh -- sh -- call 
Nor ma and -- and were always surprised that shesaid the same thing I did. We  walk in, we 

barely sat down, he turns to her and says, ﬁNorma , what do you think is wrong with Steve?ﬂ And 

Nor ma, clear out, says, ﬁSteve can
™t be responsible for the life 
and death of people.ﬂ And so by 
the time  he explained to her that these were n --
 not really life and deat
h decisions, yeah, I was -- 
I was done. Next -- next  day I went to see the dean and resi gn my position. And both -- the dean 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
131 
 
said, ﬁI™ll let you resign if you prom
ise to stay and to see the vice-president.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhat do -
- what are you going to do? ﬂ ﬁWe
ll, I™ll go on back to te -- to 
what I know how to do, teaching 
and research.ﬂ He said, ﬁThat™s not g
ood enough. We  come  to depend on you, and on your 
opinions. If you can™t provide that, 
then there™s no point your stayi
ng here.ﬂ And so from -- from 
™74 til -- til ™99, that™s how Ifunctioned at Carnegie Mellon. 
Q: So you stayed? 

A: I stayed in my -- my -- 

Q: As a -- 

A: As a professor. I just gave
 up my admi nistrative function. 
Q: Right. Did the psychiatrist
 ever understand the me taphor? 
A: No. 

Q: It didn™t ma ke any sense to him?  

A: Nah. No. I mean, the gu -- one day I walk in hi
s office, he says, I™m ju
st looking at this new 
scale of trauma  by the [i ndecipherable] the big di
ctionary. He says, ﬁIt scales trauma  on a scale 
of one to 10, and 10 is surviving concentra
tion camp. Tell me , was it really that bad?ﬂ 

Q: Did you walk out? 

A: That [indecipherable] 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah. 

Q: We  have to change the tape. 

A: Yeah, okay. 
End of Tape Eight 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
132 
 
Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: So Nor ma ma de the correct evaluation of 
your problem, and we have to stop for a second. 
Okay, so Norma ma de the correct evaluation 
and this idiot psychiatrist had no idea. 
A: Right. 
Q: And he didn™t have an idea later, either? 

A: Right, no. 

Q: Right. 

A: No. 

Q: So you rema ined as a professor and your 
symp toms went away, you did not have a -- 

A: Ah, the de-department has been -- was always
 very supportive, the symptoms  went away. At 
promotion and tenure proceedings, yowe -- you we
re expected to be a spokesperson for your 
departme nt™s candidates. In very important cases
 the department head asked me  to -- would ask 
me  to represent the departme nt, but the rules of
 the game  wer e  understood. If I started feeling 
queasy, no question asked, I was off and some body el
se was in my place. And that has worked. 

Occasionally -- sometimes I could go through, sometimes I could not. There™s no point in 

speculating which one -- which was which. 

Q: Right. 

A: But yeah, my symptoms went away. 

Q: And how ma ny more children did you two have? 

A: Yeah, we have four children. Gregory was bor
n in ™57, Carol in ™59, Peter in ™60 and then 
[indecipherable] Laura was born in ™66. So in their 
childhood we used to refer to them as the kids 

and Laura because they™re -- they™re -- 

Q: The kids [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
133 
 
A: Right. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I -- I always felt that -- that  she was a ci
vilizing influence on the ot
her three. That they -- 
they were quite wild, and -- but then when she 
came around they were vying for the privilege of 
babysitting her, etcetera. Some  -- so the kids, we
 were proud of them. I must say I was not the 
best prepared parent during thei
r teenage years. I couldn™t quite
 emphasize with their concerns 
and their worries. But certainly 
after they left home  and went through college, we™ve had a 
marvelous adult interaction with all of them, a re
lationship with all of them. Gregory went into 
civil engineering. He™s departme nt
 chair at University of Califor
nia, Berkeley. Carol went -- got 
a Master™s in public admi nistration from Colu
mbia. And from her student days on she has 
worked for the city of New York. She now works for the Departme nt of Environmental 

Resources, and we joke that she™s a more serious ci
vil engineer than either Greg or I, because she 
ma nages about a billion dollars worth of construc
tion money a year, for the sewers and s -- and 
water se -- tre -- tre -- water supply and sewerage
 for New York City. Peter went off to get a 
degree in -- in physics and ma th at Wesleyan, ca
me  out with a degree in English and classics. 
Went to Hopkins in their Center for the Hu
ma nities. And now has four appointme nts at 
Northwestern. German, comparative literature,
 philosophy and social sciences, I believe. 
Q: Four? 

A: Four -- is me mber four departme nts. He ha
s written extensively on Karnt. He was a early 
follower of derridar and he specializes in Germ
an and Jewish philosophers and -- and writers. 
Laura has a Master™s in -- Mast
er™s degree in higher education 
admi nistration. She works -- she™s 
huma n re -- HR director for a -- fo
r a software firm in Silver Sp
ring. They™re all ma rried. Four -- 
four ma rriages under chuppah, whic
h we are very proud of. Greg™s wife Carmel converted when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
134 
 
they wer -- got married, and she -- she™s marv
elous, she™s the -- the [i
ndecipherable] of the 
temple in their -- you know, leadi
ng -- leader of all the women™s ac
tivities at their 
temple. Carol, 
between her Bachelor™s and Mast
er™s spent a year in -- and 
they -- they have two -- two 
daughters, Ha nnah and Emily. Carol, after her Bachel
or™s went to Israel for [indecipherable] for 
a year, and met a Israeli guy and he came -- they
 married -- and he came 
and they got married, 
Ithzak. He now works for the same  agency as a --
 as a instrume nt tech -- instrume nt supervisor 
and they have two daughters, Molly and Ilanna
. Pe ter me t Susannah at the University of 
Chicago, she got her Ph.D. in English, she teac
hes in -- in the English departme nt at 
Northwestern, which ma kes it di fficult for them 
to move because it™s 
a two [indecipherable] 
which is hard. And they have one so -- one
 son, whose name d Daniel Imbo, but only goes by 
Imbo. She™s -- she was born in Korea, she was ad
opted and converted when she was year and a 
half. And Laura is ma rried to Steve He rberma
n, who grew up in -- in Potomac. He™s a jazz 
musician, teacher at Townsend Un
iversity, and probably will be teaching some  -- some  private 
courses at -- at the ne w music cen
ter in -- at  -- at Strathmore. 
Q: Strathmore. That™s quite a family. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did it take you a long time to talk about your
 experiences when you were a kid?  I mean, your 
Holocaust experiences? 

A: Yes. As I was going through -- yeah, I barely 
talked about it. The k-kids barely knew it, 
outlines normally, a little bit more, but barely outlines
. In this depressi on control process in --  in 
the early -- in early 70™s, I was chair of the a
dult education committee at our local temple. People 
wanted a course on the Holocaust, and this la
dy came to give some -- some talks about the 
Holocaust and then she had to be absent for one 
of the lectures. And I su
spected the connection, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
135 
 
knew the connection right away, I couldn™t verba
lize it. I volunteered to substitute for her. I 
thought that it mi ght be beneficial. Norma sat 
in the audience, cringing and hiding behind the 
back of a large ma n, and that™s when sh
e heard the story from beginning to end. 
Q: Which she hadn™t before? 

A: Not as a full story. A week later the rabbi calle
d, he heard about my talk, would I repeat it to 

the temple youth group?  And I said sure, and that™s when Gregory, Carol and Peter heard it the 

first time . Not to them, but to the youth group. A
nd then six, seven years later, Carol was taking 
a Holocaust course at the University of Michigan
 and her teacher invited 
me to come and give a 
guest lecture, and so Laura came along for the dr
ive, just on a weekend 
outing with her sister, 
and she sat in the classroo m.  

Q: And heard for the first time. 

A: And heard it for first time . It™s largely that I 
didn™t want to burden them
, and it™s largely that 
Norma wanted to shield me and shield the ch
ildren. More shielding me  than shielding the 
children. 

Q: Wa s that right? Do you think that was the ri
ght thing to do, that 
you -- you needed your own 
time? 

A: I think yes, yeah.  

Q: And the kid™s response?  We re -- were they u
nhappy that they didn™t know before, or they -- 
A: No, they were very -- ver -- appreciative th
at they -- no, they were -- never any unhappiness 
about that. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I think they appreciated that 
they were adults, that they co
uld understand, internalize the story 
and they all -- they -- they, 
ever since then been very 
protective of me
, and you know -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
136 
 
Q: Did it bring you closer 
together in some  ways? 
A: Not -- not necessarily. But, there™s a closenes
s. And the kids are always available when -- 
when I need it. In 
™94, there was this 60
th
 anniversary comme moration in Subotica, very poorly 
advertised, because they didn™t know whether the 
governme nt would allow it, this was height of 
Milosevic. My sister and I decided that we had 
to go. The wome n in the fa mily were against it, it 
was the fi ghting in -- in Bosnia. Wh at if this is 
on CNN? Wh at image will it pr oject. So I decided 
I had to go. It turned out that Peter had a -- 
had a philosophy conference in Holland the following 
week, so he came along for that. ™95 I was asked to
 give the keynote addre
ss at the International 
Conference on Computing and Civil Engineering in
 Berlin. The fa mily again worried about my 
going, decided to delegate Greg to come  with 
me , which was very useful. I me an, you know, he 
knew some  of the people, they were short of a ch
air for one the sessions, so he sat -- he was a 
chair for the session. We  went two days early
 and we drove down to Niederorschel and 
Buchenwald. And that -- that was very -- very
 satisfying. The night be
fore Gregory wanted -- 
treated me  to a nice dinner and at the dinner he 
said, ﬁDad, what is it th
at we are going to look 
for? ﬂ And I took a napkin and I drew a ma p of the 
pla -- of the camp. And the next noon we were 
there, and except that some how I 
tried to visualize the 
orientation with resp
ect to the sun, I was 
off 180 degr ees orientation, but other than that, that
 -- that was -- that -- 
the plan. So the kids 
have always been involved that way.  
Q: And do you talk a lot?  Since -- since you first opened up, do you -- do yo -- have you talked at 

various schools, or not so much? 

A: Oh, I -- ye s. 

Q: Yes.

A: Ever s -- yup. We  started the 
-- the survivor™s or ganization in
 Pittsburgh has a very, very 
active speaker™s bureau. 
They usually were reserving me  for college talks. High school talks, 
other me mb ers of the organizati
on would handle, so I had Washi
ngton Jefferson College in --in 
Washington, PA, Allegheny College, north of 
Pittsburgh. State Univ
ersity northeast of 
Pittsburgh. I™ve been repeatedly invited for -- to speak as the speaker for Holocaust  week. 
Q: Is there anything that surprises 
you when you talk to these students? 
A: Surprises me? 

Q: About how -- what they question you 
about, or what their response is?  No? 
A: No. 

Q: You like doing it, though? 

A: I did, but then I -- then I got tired be the --
 the last couple years befo
re we left Pittsburgh I 
was doing less and less, I feel slightly burned out
. But a friend who since 
then has become chair 
of the Holocaust Commi ssion, runs a 
course at -- at Carnegie Mell
on and she al -- she invited me  
regularly. There, I get essentially
 zero reaction from the students. 
Q: Zero?  

A: Yes. The intimate -- I think they™re terr ibly 
intimi dated by the fact 
that a professor whose 
office is -- is three doors 
down from t he classroom is 
talking about something --  
Q: Right, so personal. 

A: That™s so personal and so far from his academic field. 

Q: Right. 

A: I ver -- a-at student talks I usually start out
 by saying I™m in this odd position with academics, 
jealous of their scholarship, and w
ith very few exceptions, don™t want
 to go outside of their field 
of -- of --

Q: Right. 
A: -- of expertise, and here I am talking a
bout some thing I have no expertise whatsoever. 
Q: Right. Well, is there anythi
ng that you would like to talk 
about that I haven™t asked you? 
A: No, I think you were very thorough and I appreciate it very much. 

Q: We ll, I want to thank you very mu ch, cause it™
s been really wonderful 
to spend the day with 
you. 

A: I appreciate that. 

Q: Thank you. 

A: Thank you. 

Q: And I™m very grateful for your be
ing willing to tell us your story. 
A: Thank you. 

Q: Okay. – And who is this, Steve? 

A: This is my mother. I suspect it™s a -- either
 her high school graduati
on picture or one taken 
even earlier than that. I don™
t know anything more about it. 
Q: And how did you happen to ca -- to have it? 

A: Friends, acquaintances over the 
years have even gi -- either gi
ven us photographs or allowed 
us to copy from theirs. My sister has a much bette
r collection than I have. 
I™ve just -- most of 
these are copies from -- from her collection. 

Q: And this photo? 

A: This is my father during World War 
1
. He was in -- a officer in
 the Austro-Hungarian army, 
because he had spent several years in Croatia befo
re the war, he speak -- spoke Croatian, so he 
was assigned to a -- to a Bosnian regime nt.  

Q: And this group? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
139 
 
A: These are the employees of the printing pl ant,
 Minerva in Subotica, wi
th my father and my 
uncle sitting in fr ont. The -- my uncle was the edit 
-- was the owner and editor, my father was the 
manager. And behind it is the -- the plan
t where the -- the pr in
ting presses were.  
Q: And this group? 

A: This is the editorial  staff, again my uncle in
 the mi ddle in front, and my
 father next to him. 
Several of these people became quite prominent journalists. So me of the m on -- under Fascist 

Hungary, a number of them in post-war Hungary. 
Not shown in this picture are several people 

who had worked for my father who later came to 
the States. When I came to the St ates there was 
still a Hungarian daily paper in New York, Detroit and Toronto, and a Hunga
rian literary journal 
in New York, all four of the editors had worked for my father.  

Q: [indecipherable]  

A: Something like that. 

Q: This picture? 
A: Well this is my fa mily at the local resort 
outside Subotica. I™m sitting on my mother™s lap and 
my sister is in front of my father with tw
o of my mother™s friends in -- in the group. 
Q: What year would this have been? 
A: ™33.  

Q: And wha t ™s this group? 

A: This is my grade school, I think it must be se
cond grade class picture. I 
sit next to the teacher 
and my best friend sits on the other side of the 
teacher an -- we were sort
 of the leaders of the 
boys and the two girls nex -- sitting next to me  
were the unquestioned leaders of the girls. The 
second one, in the dark dress, lives in Israel. We
 visit her every time we go to Israel. We once 
coun -- counted heads. I -- I 
believe four people in that -- in that
 picture survived the Holocaust.

Q: And this picture? 
A: This mus t  be s -- well, no question, this 
is summer of th -- of 1940, one year before the 

occupation. My parents and my sist
er and I looking at -- I don™t reme mbe r  any more whether it™s 

a chicken coop or -- or a rabbit hutch. My father b
ought this fo -- small vineyard, and he tried to 
-- to grow wine and -- and ma ke schnapps out of th
e -- the fruit, but it wa
sn™t very successful.  
Q: And this shot? 

A: My -- th -- my sister and I.
 She™s wearing the uniform of 
s econd year of the academic high 
school, gymnasium, so this must be ™40 - ™41 academic year. 

Q: In Yugoslavia? 

A: In Yugoslavia. I obviously 
didn™t know how to tie a tie.  
Q: And who ™ s this? 

A: That™s my sister and I in Pari
s, ™47 - ™48 - ™49, I can
™t  tell, but that ™s afte
r we -- we got out of 
Yugoslavia and -- and lived in Paris.
 In fact, it must be close to
 ™47, because I reme mber that™s 
the suit in which I traveled. 

Q: And wha t  does this represent? 

A: This is the -- a photo
copy of the Buchenwald index card. On 
the left I™m listed as a Slovakian 
Jewish political prisoner, because
 I was -- I was pushed into a Sl
ovakian transport. Wh y political 
I don™t know. And my birth date 
I obviously intended to give 16
th
 -- April 16, 1929, some how it -
- two of the numbers got mangled, but clearly I -- I 
was use -- always using 
my sister™s birth date 
when I -- whenever I needed a birth date in 
Buchenwald and throughout the concentration camp. 
Q: And this? 

A: This is my provisional iden
tification card, issued by the Ameri
can army, after the liberation in 
Buchenwald. I still use Josef -- Josef for my na me
, but I think I went back to June six, 1931 as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494  
141 
 
my birth date. And I never -- I didn™t ma ke th
e comparison. I see the Bu
chenwald number is on 
it, which I -- I -- I didn™t know
 I had a Buchenwald number un
til this -- this past fall.  
Q: And this? 
A: This is an artist™s rendering of the syna
gogue in Subotica, the Refor m s ynagogues, completed 
in 1902, designed by my  mother™s uncle, a very
 well known architect of the Hungarian art 
noveau moveme nt. The temple now i s in very bad 
condition. We are trying 
to find a way to have 
it restor ed. The -- it™s -- it™s 
on the -- on the UNESCO register
 of threatened historical 
monume nts, it™s on the list of 
Jewish threatened historical 
mo nume nts, but I -- I don™t know 
whether we™ll be able to save it.  

Q: And this to you? 

A: This is a copy of my father™s newspaper.
 I guess the date is 
-- is 1933, December 22
nd
. So at 
that time my  uncle was still living, and so my uncl
e was still the editor. 36 pages, one dinar. And 

the headlines are, ﬁThe King -- King™s Visit to
 Zargrev. A rapprocheme nt
 Between -- Friendship 
Treaty Between France and Germany Proposed by 
the French par -- Perfume King, and A Strike 
of the Postal Workers in Greece.
ﬂ In case you needed to know what the news were in 1933.  
Q: And this, Steve? 

A: This is my mother. The date is 1918, so she 
probably was an art student in Budapest. I™m told 
that the sketch was done by one of her classmates
, whose signature appears below, Fusti Molnar 
Katalina. But I™ve tried pouring ove
r Hungarian art -- artistic -- ar
tist™s directories and artist™ 
dictionaries and I have never lo
cated that name . So I -- I don™t know
 who the artist was. But this 
-- this has always hung in our house. 
This -- this is one of the -- the 
things that were in the folder 
that our -- our cook saved for us. 

Q: And this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494

A: My mother traveled extensiv
ely, 1924 - ™25 - ™26 in Austria, 
France and Italy, and this is one 
of the etchings she ma de  in Fl
orence. I don™t -- for li 
-- for lithographs I -- 
I know that she did 
pencil drawings first and did the et
chings at -- at home. I -- I -- a
nd did the lithographs at home. I 
don™t know whether she did the same  thing for th
e etchings, but I presume  she did, that she 
didn™t have all of her -- her coppe
r, and -- and acid and everythi
ng else that goes into etching 
with her. So this is n -- nice view of 
the -- of Florence that I™ve always liked. 
Q: And this? 

A: This is one of her lithographs, it™s also Flor
ence. Think a little bit more Impressionistic than 

the etching. The -- my fa ther™s printing plant had a 
large, flat -- flatbed pr
ess with a large stone 
norma lly used for ma king ma ps, and I™m sure that th
at™s what my mother used to --  to pull the 
lithographs.  

Q: And who is this good looking group? 

A: This is my fa mily at my granddaughter™s Ba
t Mitzvah, two years a -- three years ago. My wife 
and I in front and our four children, Gregory, Pe
ter, Carol and Laura and their spouses, and my 
son-in-law Ithzak™s family in the back row. 
And the grandchildren, six grandchildren, including 
the one on the side, that -- that™s 
in bo -- that is in Chicago, and 
the other boy is 
here in Silver 
Spring and we have mo -- much mo
r e  actively than any of the othe
rs, we have been involved in 
his -- in his growth, which 
has been very satisfying.
