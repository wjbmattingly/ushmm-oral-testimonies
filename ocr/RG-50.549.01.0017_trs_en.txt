Q ue s t ion: So , I th ou ght m a ybe  we s hou l d s tar t wi t h s om e of  th os e, j u s t a co up le 
things about the war that you didn™t cover too much in the previous interview.  You 

mentioned that there 
were a lot oftim es that youand yourbrothers,brother and 

sisters were almostcaught.  You toldoneortwo storiesbut I wonder ifthere were 

s om e othe r m om ent s  that  you  rem em b e r com i ng c l o se  to be i n g cau gh t b y t he  Na zi s.
 
A n s we r : W el l the , the o n l y on es  
that I™mawareof were whenthey were going to 

interview us on the,on the train, when they were,theyfoundthe teacher with the 

C om m un ist boo k s an ds o o n.  T ha t ™s  the  on l y ti m e  tha t I ™m  awa r e of  and  I ™m  not su r e 

I m e nt ione d th en , I,  I , as  I sa i d,  I ™m n ot
 
s u re  I  rem em be r  t h is  t he n b ut  I ,  I ,  we j u st  went 
b ac k t o Hol l and a nd f or  thef i r st t im e we vi s i te d the h ou se  whe r e we h ad been i n 

hiding during the war in Biltoven(ph)and wehad, had tomove outof that house.  

And I can rem ember a couple of times, not i
n,when we were inthathouse but when 
we m oved to I think the thirdhousethat we lived in, in Bilthoven(ph), that several 

times we were told to leave thehousebecausethere was, was gonna bea raid on 

t he  h ou se  an d tha t  we h ad t o go i nt o the  b ac k  ya r d  a
nd  go  to ne i ghb or s  and  t ha t we 
hadto stay away,until,ineffect, we were toldto com e back.  So,clearly, there was 

a lot of  suspicion that, that the fam ily we stayed with, the Bookas(ph) were hiding 

children,but, and I™m notsure what they didwith our
 
clothes but there were other 
childrenthere who were not Jewish so,that, they couldeasily have probablyused 

our thingsto say those don™t belong, thosebelong tothe children who were clearly 

not Jewish.  So, anyway, so several timesthat we had to, to
 
d i sa ppear,  t o a vo id  t he 
r a i d sandt ha t i s, th at is  som e th i n g I rem em be r ed onl y la te r a s we vi s i t ed the th i r d

M y pa re nt s h a ve,  we 
asked them to put their mem orieson videotape,on audiotape.  And they,I,Ididn™t

four or five times the police were after them because, because m y

where, wherem y parents were inhiding,cam eto visit them and, and,and

with the NS Bay,(ph) which was th
e  Du tc h Nazi  P a rt y.   At  lea s tf our ,f i vet im e s, s o, 
it was tenuous.  And, and the reasons they had the raids, they didn™t want to betray 
us.  They didnot.  They hopedthat if they werecaught, at least that we children 

would be safe.
 
Q: A nd  the  Dutch, jus
t beforethis interviewwhen we were talkingf or a couple 
m inutes, you mentioned that it was a smallpercentage of the Dutch who, whoactually 

didn™t betray Jews.  Can you talk a little bit m ore about, I mean, obviously that™s how 

you survived, right?
 
A : W
asbecause we were not betrayed.  Ineed to stress,I, what, whatm y sense 
about Holland during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in 

retrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps f ive, f ive percent, if that 

many who act
i ve l y t r ied to  he l p Je ws  if ,  I ™m  no t s u r e t he r e we r e tha t m an y,  wh o we r e, 
who riskedtheirown lives.  And they weretruly thenoble, the verynoblepeople, 

because it™s hard to ask people to do that for others.  So, about five percent perhaps 

t h a t, I ™m  no
t even sure it was, were thatmany, that actually,  activelydid something.  
My f eeling is that 80 percent didn™t care.  I™m not saying that they would have 

betrayedbut also that they didn™t care.  But we had asignificant, I wouldsayf ifty to 

twenty per
c ent  who wer et r a it o r s.  A hu gepe r c ent a get hat  we re pa r tof  the , the y 
belonged tothe NS Bay(ph) which is the NationalSocialistParty, actively, who 

actively worked with the, with the  Nazis, with theGermansandbetrayed Jews.  

Most Dutch Jews probably werebetrayedby Dutch rather than thosewere in hiding.  

I think they, they said som ething like35,000 were inhiding, 15,000 werebetrayed.

That™s a signif icant number.  Probablymostlyby the Dutch.  Dutchpeople who got 
a few dollars for it, a few gui

Q: Did you evertalktoBetty Booka(ph)about this, later?
 
A: Oh yes, oh yes.
 
Q:W hat wereher thoughts?
 
A :W el l, s he wa s t
ruly oneof theextraordinaryheroines, a rem arkable woman who, 
b ec au se of  he r ba c k gro und, th e Qu ak e r ba ck gr o un d, s he  was B r it is h ,o ne  of  the 

Cadbury(ph) fam ilies.  She couldn™t tolerate what was happening.  From  the very 

beginning, she couldn™t tolerate t
h is kind of  in j us t i ce an d ab s ol ut e l y, a bs o lu te l y made 
itpartof her, her life,her comm itmentto saveasmany as shecould.  And this was 

who she was.  This was her,herm ission in life and that™s whatI gather, was truefor 

most ofthe rescuers.  They saw somethinghappening that was so intolerableto 

them  that, that they couldnot live with themselvesand letthis, let thishappen to 

others.  And they, they,they basicallydid what they, theydid whatthey did because 

they couldn™t do anything else.  Those are the rescuers.
 
Q: How many peopledid she save, do youthink?
 
A: Oh,she,tensI would saybecause,Ididn™t realize there wereother Jewish children 

in the house, course we didn™t know that therewere.  But there wereothers, she hid

other Jews and 
helped others to hide others and there was a whole system  the 
__________ she andher husband Case(ph) created.  They,  they. there wasa 

groupof Jewish children livingclose bythatthey took careof andtriedto save.  So 

they, throughout the war, wentoutof their way to, to save,to save Jewishchildren.
 
Q: And could have died them selves.
 
A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact, one of  the terrifying stories was that, there was a, an 

a c t of  sabo ta ge.  S om e ,  s om e  u nde r gr o und ,  m em be r s  of  th e  un de r gr o un d b le w up

they, that they hadtohelphide people.  But it was all,it wasallhiddenand it was 

justpartof their, oftheir ethicthat they wouldnot cooperate and collaborate with the 

Nazis and they would 
do what they could to help those in need.

t ha t the ym i ght be t ra y by m i s ta ke?
 

A: Right.  Not to im plicate.  Right.  And it was Betty by the way, it was, in retrospect, 

it
 
wa sB ett y who i ns i s ted do i n g th i s, not Ca se ( ph ) .  I don ™ t kno w,  we ™ r en ot e ven su re 
Case(ph) knew we wereJewish, because they took inotherchildren.  It was Betty 

who did it.
 
Q : W hat  k i nd of  wom an wa s  sh e?
 

A :E xtra o rd in a ry,a  ge ntle, little, beautifu l, 
sweetestface in the world, kind, caring, 
concerned,loving,extraordinary wom an who, who just, she couldn™t doanything 

different.  And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she cameto visit 

usand whenever we went back to Holland,of cours
e, we visited her until she died.  
A nd ,a nd th e in te re s t ing th i n g ab out her is , she  wa s so co nc e rn ed abo ut ot he r s tha t 

in some way, she neglected her own children.  She had eight children, they had 

e i gh tc h ild r en them se l ves and ,a nd tha t,  yous ee th at often in those wh oa r et r u l y 

comm itted to the well

beingof others that, very often, there issome, you, yousortof

Betty was so concernedfor,for others.  You only have somuchenergy.
 
Q: 
Did you ever seeher show emotion during the war over the situation?
 
A: No.  No,because basically we were toldnever to tellanybody and so, wedidn™t 

exceptthose little lapses.  AndIdidn™teven know that she knew we were Jewish.  I

fearof being discovered that stayed withm e and the inabilityto talk toanybodyabout 

it,fortwo years.  So all I knew was that wehad tobe therebecausewe™d be killed 

butIdid not know thatBetty knew we wereJewish.  Itturnedout she didbut really, 

most others didn™t, inthefam ily.

that I remem berbasically going toPeggy Coster(ph) and saying, ﬁI™m  really sad, I

notwithstanding the m iserable first ten years, was liberation, was, was our, was for 

me true liber

wh o  I am t oda y.   T r agic a l l y,  he , so t he r e I ™ m  very gr a tef u l  to  h im .  But  t ra gi ca l l y,  he

very little is authentic and, and, even, naïve and innocent as I was when I came to 

California, living in thisfake environment,evenI knew that these people weren™t real.  

Even I knew that these expressions of interest meant nothing.  And so he, he did 

not,andI™m  not blam ing him,but he clearly and neither didPeggy, Ithink,Peggy is 

a, wasa sweet, she wasalways very sweet,Ineed tostress that.  But, but Henry

Henry

A: Ihavetobe very carefulbecause what™s interesting is that Hetty(ph) and 

Herm an(ph) who Iadore, justabsolutely wonderfu
l p eo pl e, the y d i d exa ct l y wh a t the 

rest ofus did, is thatforget it,forget it.  T ry toforget it, goon with your life.  Don™t 

talkabout it, don™tdeal with itbutfor heaven™s sakes, and Ithinkthathas beena 

hallmark for at least our fam ily, is prove that the Germans, that the Nazis were wrong, 

p r o ve that you ™ r eo ka y.   P ro ve t hat yo u ™ re ape r s onof  va lu e.   A nd so ho w do you 

prove that? By accomplishing things.  And by golly, did they accomplish.  But in that 

ef f o rt  to a c com p l is h, t he y,  the  child r en,
 
exceptforthe youngest, thetwo older girls 
had to fend for, had to fend for them selves a great deal and were to some extent 

neglected.  And notbecause they wanted to do thatbut because they, theyhad, 

t he yf el tt he yh ad to wo r k  so hardt o, tom a ke it  
in this country.  And they did make 

in this country.  And then allof thattension andall ofthepain was never discussed 

so it, itaffected their livesand these girls grew upknowing abouttheir background 

p a rtly butno td ea lin gwith it.  Not, it, witho
ut  it be in gd i s cu s sed .   And so t he y 
become adultsand they, they have to deal with it in, intheirown way, and,and,again 

I don™t wanna talk about their circumstances because that™s not up to me to do so.  

But I know, because of m y background, that trem e

Because I recognize thateverybody else isprobably

growing and the,and the most wonderful 
thing isthemore atpeace youare with yourself, the nicer you canbe to otherpeople.  

You don™t, cause you don™t have to destroy others to feel good about yourself.  As a 

matter of fact, it hurts you to be negative or destructive to others and so you know 

that those who aredestructive,there™s something wrong with them.  Because if you

Q: So in other words, youdidn™t exercisethatpower thattheauthority f igure orexpert

A: Exactly, never. I was never the expert.  I always let them know t
he y we r e t he

with them.  Butthey hadto tellme whether they f it it,theym ightnot, and I would tell 

them , look, thism ay not be rightfor you.  Letme know, youknow bett
e r  th a n  I do .  
If  we talkabout something that,that you don™t,youf indoffensive, letme know.  So 

that it was,I was, I™ve neverbeen theexpert.  Im ean,and I, inmy work atthe 

medicalschool, I™m trying to teach ourmedical students, thatas future 
physicians, 
it™s still the patient who is theexperton the patient.

wonderful to talk with them  and, and see their sensitivity.
 
Q: How oldor new is this program?
 
A:W e™re going inourfourth year.  So.  W

Q: It™s excitin g.
 
A:It is.  They™re wonderful. It™s a great placeto work.
 
Q: I
t also sounds goodon the level thatI interviewedadoctorfor a story I was working 

on recently and he said, ﬁPeople don™t realize how prone physiciansare toproblem s; 

drug problem s, stress, enorm ous, enormous stress.ﬂ  So it sounds like perhaps this 

gi
ves them  some tools to work on their problems too. 
 
A: Yes.  Very nice.  Yes.  Because we expect physicians to be super
-
h um a n.  And 
t he y™ r e ju st peo p le , bri gh tp eop l eont he wh o le ,a nd ca r i n g peo ple on the wh o l e.  But 

that™sall they are.  And oneof the greattragedies is isthat in the traditional 

approach,our physicians are taught, itbecomes, because they tendto be obsessive
-

com pulsive, they tendto beperfectionists, they tend to behard
-
d r i ve n  and  s o on.  
W hat they want todo is they want tof ix thi
ngs.  And they™re happy when they can 
f ix som ething.  And whenthey can™t fix something,they get very unhappy and very 

stressed and so whathappens very often is that, particularly during thedying process 

when they can™t do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient.  Because they 

can™tdo anymore.  Andso you see thisavoidance behavior.  That™sbecause 

An i ta  Fra nk

they™re uncomfortable.  They can™t,they can™tf ix, theotherfocusfor me is is that 
there is very little fixing you guys cando.  If you™re lucky 
you can cut out a, you can 

cure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you 

can do, you can do some other things that truly f ix things.  But m ost of the tim e, it 

isn™t as sim pleasthat.  Most of the time you just have to
 
learn to work with your 
p at i en t t o m a ke  it as , to m a k e it be tt e r.   B ut th at m ean s yo u n ee d t o b e in  pa r tne rs h ip 

with your patient.  Anddon™t worry somuchaboutfixing it.
 
Q: And, and don™t take all the responsibility.
 
A: Don™t take all the responsibility.  Leavethe responsibility where itbelongsbut then 

behave in ways that you comm unicate that clearly.  I,that™s certainlywhatI™ve done 

inm y counseling,always left thepower withmy clients.  Always.  
 
Q:And you learnedthat through your own experi

took him  outside, I didn™t wanna  be him , I didn™t him  to be in that environment.  W ell, 

I tell you, as far as he™s concerned, cigarettes have always stunk.  So he never

ﬁLoren(ph), what do you think about al

to think that you would be that stupid.ﬂ  So, basically I expressed m y total disdain for

perhaps Ifeltthat understanding the Soviet Union betterm ight help me do something 
worthwhileor som e, som ething like that.  Itwas certainly not because Ihadany 

C om m un is
t interest.  It was truly becausethe Soviet Union represented dangerI 
think and, and another great power and fascination.  And then I, then I went to 

Harvard in the RussianStudiesprogram and Iwas, and I was rightbecause it wasa 

wonderful choice because it™sa, it™s a,hasan unbelievablehistory.  Russian history

research assistant to senior researchers in, in Soviet foreign and m ilitary affairs.  
 
Q : W hat  do es  the  Ran

prim arily did m ilitary, they did primarily m ilitary and econom ic and foreign policy 

researchfor theAir Force.  It wassortof, it was the researc

Now they™ve expanded.  They, they doa lot ofresearch in health areas.  I still think 

that theirmajor contractor is theAirForce but they™ve, theydo, they dosuperb

said, ﬁYouare?ﬂ  And it was just likethistotalchange came, cam eoverhim andhe 

said, ﬁIs there

it™s just like he™s, talk the party line but then when it came to trusting me because he 

felt thathe could, it was just like questioning everything.  So that was sort of, yeah,

problems but you look,anyway.  And sothatwas, that was sortof anice story and 
then another,one of themost touching stories was in, in, Ithink it was in Leningrad,
