PHRASES MISSING 
 
A: ...1913. My name  is Leo Hanin. And when I 
was born they called me  Leib Hanin. You 
know, the Jewish way birth certificates are wr
itten. Then uh it was...I changed it, because 
Leib didn't sound too...uh modern, so-to-speak, wh
en I went to Russian school in Harbin, 
China. So I became Lev, and Lev become s Leo. 
 
Q: OK. 
 
A: When I lived a short time in Israel, I called myself Arye. 
 
Q: Alright. 
 
A: That all means the same  thing, you know. 
 
Q: Alright. Tell me , you were, 
you were born in Vilnius [
Pol:
 Wi _no], in Vilna. Uh, how did 
you get uh from Vilna to China?  
 
A: In 19...I was born in 1913, as I said. In 1916, 
my parents uh decided to run away from 
Russia--uh, or those areas that were involved in
 in the uprisings and wars and revolution, at 
that time. And they decided to go to China,
 because that was the only way they could go. 
Also, I think, the reason of their going to China 
was that uh one of our relatives was there. 
He was there in the Russian army, which at th
at time was stationed in some of the cities 
in...in...in Manchuria, which was part of China. 
And that's  how we went. And I...I...I asked 
my father some times, "Why did you go to Harbi
n, of all the places?  You know, Jews were 
running away. They were running to America, 
to New York, everywhere. Why did you go to 
China? "  He says, "Well, there was no other wa
y. We  had to go; and we ran. We  ran for our 
lives.ﬂ And...and that way, I think about three t
housand or four thousand Jews from Russia, 
in those areas--Poland-Lithuania, in that 
time--wound up in...in...in Harbin. We  had a nice 
little Jewish community in Harbin. China. 
 
Q: Would you describe it?  Tell, talk about yourself and your family. 
 
A: We ll, I was several...two years old when we 
came there. Uh I don't recollect what my father 
doing for a living; but apparently he was doing 
alright, because we had a nice home. Uh we 
lived...I went to a Jewish school. We  had a Ta
lmud Torah. As small a community, we had in 
Harbin...in China, we had uh, we we were orga
nized. We  had wonderful leaders. Rabbis and 
uh Zionist uh leaders. Dr. Kaufma n, one of th
em. Uh they organized - we had a Jewish 
school. We  had uh a Jewish hospital. We  had two or three synagogues. And we had Talmud 

Torah. That's the Jewish school that I went 
to. That's where I learned Hebrew and some 

Yiddish.

Q: OK. 
 
A: And then when I was uh ten 
years old, I went to a Russian school. And stayed there for six 
years; and that was in 1929. Uh my parents,
 right when I graduated Russian school, uh 
decided to send me and my brother to Shanghai. 
At that time, situation in Harbin started to 
deteriorate because the Japanese were moving 
in. And the Japanese eventually occupied 
Manchuria, and set up an independent
 country of Manchukuo in 1934 or '33.
1
 I don't 
reme mber exactly when it was. Anyway, so my
 parents decided to be safe, send us to 
Shanghai. They eventually also came and lived 
in Shanghai. We lived together in Shanghai. 
That's where I went to a British school. And I 
studied the English language that I know now. 
And then, sixteen or seventeen th
at I was, I went to work. And that's ...and that's... I went to 
work for an office which was importing uh te
xtiles from England, Japan. And uh in 1936, I 
got ma rried. In 1937, my...I think it was '36. Uh, 
the...my firm decided to send me to Japan. 
Kobe, Japan. That is how I f
ound myself--I...my wife and me . And we still had no children at 
that time. I found myself in Kobe, Japan. 
 
Q: OK. Before we get to Kobe, can we back up a little bit?  
 
A: I beg your pardon?  
 
Q: Before we get to Kobe, can we back up 
a little bit?  Tell me what it was like for a young 
Jewish boy growing up in Harbin, China. What were you relations with the Chinese like?  
 
A: Uh, we didn't have any close relations w
ith the Chinese. Uh we...our parents were doing 
business with the Chinese. Uh, we were growing up in a nice Jewish atmosphere. We  had 
uh...and of course, Zionism was very prevalent 
at that time. We had people comi ng from 
Palestine in those days; and giving us lectur
es, and sending...uh, selling--at that time it wasn't  
one. What was it at that time?  They were 
selling land, actually. A lot of our people bought 
land in Palestine in those days. Keren Kaye
me th and Keren Hayesod, the Jewish funds.
2
 And 
we had uh we had very - I belonged to a Jewish organization, 
Ritrum Pilog (ph)
, and uh we 
were very active. I mean, in sense like st
udying English and studying Jewish history, the 
history of Zionism; and, of course, being young fe
llows, we were all in sports. And uh it was 
a good, good fine Jewish life. We  had good teach
ers, good instructors. And uh it's amazing 
how how this small community of Jews in Harbin
 - I always think of it as a lot of of fine 
                        
 
    
1
 Also, Manchoukuo or Manchutikuo. Set up as an
 independent republic in February 1932 
following the Japanese occupation of Manchuria 
in 1931. The nearby provinc
e of Jehol was added 
in 1933. Became a puppet empire under the nominal l
eadership of Manchu emperor K'ang Tê in 
1934. Dissolved in 1945.

good warm feelings because they were so dedicated, all these rabbis and the teachers and the 
Zionist leaders. So eventually when uh... I am getting a little jump, we'll come back again 
later, if you don't mi nd. Eventua
lly in 1948, after the war, when the State of Israel was 
established, where ...where else would I go?  Only to Israel. 
 
Q: Ofcourse. 
 
A: And we went to Israel. In 1948. We  stayed th
ere two years. Then back to Japan. But that's 
another story. 
 
Q: That's another story. OK. Now we'll go back. 
You have just arrived then in Kobe. Will you 
describe your impressions on first arriving?  You are now a young man...  
 
A: Always, uh we had a little house. I was busy, of
 course, doing the job that I was assigned to 
do. I used to travel a lot all over Japan, buying 
merchandise and uh shipping it to China, to 

my firm that I was working for. Always we 
were looking for Jewish friends. We  established 
some contacts. A little synagogue there, and uh 
then that's where we established a little 
Jewish community. I mean, this Jewish community uh...uh mainly, the main activities--

besides, of course, having a little synagogue 
where we gathered uh on high holidays and 
Passover--not very religiously inclined people. The Sephardic Jews that lived there were 
much much stronger in that. They had mi nya
n every Friday night and every Shabbos, you 
know; but we were not that uh religiously i
nvolved. Mostly our people played cards over 
there. And the ladies played Mah  Jong, and th
e men played poker or whatever they played. 
And there was a restaurant; just that, meeti
ng. It was like a club more or less. Jewish 
community was like a club where people got together. But... 
 
Q: You said earlier that there was a differen
ce between Sephardic Jews and the Askhenazi 
Jews... 
 
A: We  felt that we were being looked uh looke
d down upon. You see, we were stateless people. 
We had no passports. Having ...our parents really 
ran away from Russia to China. We had no 
nationality. Uh, some  of our people who wanted 
to become Soviet did become; but we didn't 
want to become  Soviets. We  stayed as Ru
ssian immi grants. And we were...the Jewish 
community that was organized there was uh was 
involved in in keeping in touch with the 
Chinese authorities who were in charge of th
e... I mean, if you had to have a passport to 
travel somewhere, they would issue you a Chinese passport. But nationality was White 

Russian Immi grant. 
 
Q: Isee. 
 
A: White Immi grant - stateless. And then it was not 
so easy to come to Japan to get a visa, but if 
you went on--uh, like my firm applied for 
me, uh they transferring me on uh certain 
situation, a job, so they gave me a visa. 
Of course, uh you have to you know, they... You 
always knew when you live at that time in
 Japan that you were being uh...somebody was 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090

looking at, all the time watching you. As a matter of fact... 
 
Q: How did you know?   
 
A: Uh, plainclothes police--Japanese. Every foreigner was considered to be a spy in those days. 
It was uh an unusual situation, but it didn't bot
her us. As long as you didn't engage yourself 
into any politics, or...or...or uh doing things 
that are against the law, nobody bothered you. 
You just went on with your business, and that 
was it. That was the life over there. Very easy. 
I mean, we were young-- friends, uh social uh uh 
parties, playing cards and travelling. And 
uh that was the life. In those days, travelling 
was not as simple as it is today - jump on a 
plane and you fly. Shanghai was about 48 hour
s by boat. You know, it was... But...but we 
did we did our share of travelling. But you coul
dn't travel...say if I wanted to go to Hong 
Kong, I couldn't. Being a white Russian immi grant, they wouldn't let me in. It's...it's hard to 
explain how it was, but uh we ma naged. 
We  ma naged. We  lived. And I suppose uh...uh, 
again, comi ng back to our conversations before
, that there was some  reason why we were 
there. Maybe we were there because we had to...t
o be in the right place at the right time as 
you said. I...I...older I became, more I think that's
 what it's all about. We had to be there to 
help our people. Three thousand. And...and...and 
it's amazing. The Japanese, who were very 
strict in allowing non-uh foreigners so to speak 
to come  to Japan, all of a sudden they opened 
their doors. This man, this Sugihara--the Ja
panese Consul that was stamping across the 
visas...the passport for the Japanese transient visas--it's amazing.  
 
Q: Let's back up so we can get some context. 
We'r e in Kobe, and you've been there for a little 
while now.  
 
A: Yes, uh I just I have to back up a little bit. In 1938, I went back to Shanghai. My son was 
born at that time; and my wife and myself a
nd my son, we went back to Shanghai because 
the firm that I was working for transferred me
 back to Shanghai where I stayed for a year 
and a half. And in 1930... 1940...1940--yes, beginni
ng of 1940, I received a proposition from 
another firm which was doing business with
 uh... with--again...again, curiosity, with 
Curaçao. Of all the...Curaçao and Panama . Th
e name  of the firm was Curaçao-Panama  
Boeki Kaisya, which means in Japanese "[Cu
raçao-Panama ] Trading Company.ﬂ Uh, a ma n 
I met in Japan, a Jewish man from Panama--Max
 Pecker--he met me in Japan, and he needed 
somebody to run his business over there. So he 
came to Shanghai and he took me to Japan; 
and he told me , "I know you are involved in Je
wish social work. I don't want you to be busy 
with any social work. We  have a lot of wo
rk to do here, buying all kinds of goods, a lot 
merchandise.ﬂ I said, "Max, I'll be there.ﬂ 
And uh I...and that's what it was. And...and ...and 
if it would be of interest, can I digress a little bit? 
 
Q: Please. As much as you like. 
 
A: Max Pecker, who was my boss from Panama
, uh brought me  to Japan. Kobe, again Kobe. 
And there was a really Jewish community wh
ich was about thirty families, and I became 
active. Having uh...having been one of the few 
who spoke good English and and could write 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090

English, I became Secretary of the Jewish commun
ity at that time. Not paid, of course; just 
social, you know. And also my job 
was Yiddish. Yiddish - use to receive a lot of magazines, 
Zionist magazines. And the others. And I used
 to translate and...and speak about the various 
happenings, and that were happening in the Je
wish world, in Poland, at that time. And uh 
when we were there in Japan in 1941 with
 Max, in 1940...'40, uh his parents were in uh 
Bessarabia.
3
 He left Bessarabia when he was a young 
ma n, and went to South America. And 
he developed a very good, large business in Panama , in Curaçao, in...in...uh in Peru. There 
was a number of group, Jews from Roma nia. I 
don't know if you are awar
e of it. A group of 
them went to...and they went to South Am
erican countries--Argentina, Venezuela--and 
they...'til today, they are there. So at that time, the refugees started to come in. This...the 

whole situation, the whole historical situa
tion...people started to come in. And I started 
getting more and more active. And uh I said, "Max, where are your parents? "  He says, 

"They are in a small city in Noua Sulita, i
n...in Bessarabia.ﬂ I said, "Max, look what's going 
on in Europe. Hitler is advancing, and Poland is
 already destroyed. I mean, occupied half-
way.ﬂ It was occupied by the Russians, half
-way occupied by the Germans. "And Roma nia 
could be next. Get them out of there!"  He says, "Look, I am writing letters to them.ﬂ 

And...and he used to correspond to them in Yi
ddish. And...and he show it [to] me ; and he 
says, "Look, I want you to come  here, and then 
we will...ﬂ And about three weeks later, he 
got the reply from them. And...and his ol
d ma n, his father, writes... He says, 
"Who's_______________?  Where shall I go?  My shtube [
Yidd:
 "home" or "house"? ] is 
done, my shul is done, my life is done, my gesheft [
Yidd:
 "essence of being" or "soul"] is...ﬂ 
I don't know what gesheft he was doing in a sm
all place called Noua Sulita. I said, "Max, get 
them out of there!"  He says, "Look, he doesn't  want to come .ﬂ And then he left. But before 
he left, he said, "Look, I'm going to write my fa
ther a letter. If he ever wants to leave 
Roma nia, you bring. Now you are 
bringing Jews from Poland- Lithuania...ﬂ You know, this 
whole...the Jews started to come  in. And he says, 
"I wrote to my father if he ever thinks there 
is need for him to leave uh Romania, to le
t you know and you'll see what you can do.ﬂ I said, 
"Max, we'r e bringing people from Poland fr
om under Russian occupation. Who knows?  Uh, 
Romania, Bessarabia. It's another border.ﬂ He sa
ys to me, "I wrote him a letter.ﬂ And I said, 
"Look, do you have photographs of your father, your 
mother and your two sisters? "  He says, 
"Yes.ﬂ I said, "Leave them to me in case 
the communication, something.ﬂ Something told 
me I must have those photographs. He gave 
them to me . And uh about uh three or four 
weeks later, you know, Roma nia became a uh a 
uh ally of Germany; but Bessarabia was 
occupied by the Russians, and it became the Moldavian Republic.
4
 So they were under the 
Russians. And I get a telegram one day in Yiddish. I mean, the writing was in English, of

Rom:
 Basarabia. Asserted independence from 
Russia in 1917 as Moldavian Republic; joined 
Roma nia 09 Apr 1918. Recognized as part of Ro

claime d by the USSR. Seized by the USSR 27 J
un 1940 and incorporated with Bukovina in Aug 
1940 as Moldavian SSR. Recaptured by Germans and Roma nians June 1941; recovered by USSR in 

1944.

course, but they were English [
NB:
 Yiddish] words. "Das bild was Max 
__________________.ﬂ In other words, "The picture that
 Max wanted to send me , I have to 
have it very, very, very urgently.ﬂ So I unders
tood. They have to run. So I uh...I went, and I 
started talking to some of the of the rabbi
s, Rabbi Shapiro. He was a good friend of mi ne, 
one of the refugees. I said, "Shloi
me, this is the story. What to do?"  He says, "Well, if they 
were in Lithuania I would tell them what to 
do, but they are in another place.ﬂ So I said, 
"Think about it. We must save them. We must 
do some thing about it.ﬂ So he says to me, uh, 
"Give me a day or two to think about it.ﬂ A
nd he came running to me  one day, and he says 
uh... Uh, I'll talk about it, [but
] I will not name the country; because maybe...one of the South 
American countries, the consul is selling pa
ssports. Better I don't name the country. Don't 
you think?  
 
Q: No, no. Name  the country. 
 
A: Chile. The Chilean consul. I said I have to m
eet him. I want to talk to him. So uh I don't 
reme mber how I me t him. Anyway, he gave me ...he
 says, "I want to talk to you.ﬂ I said, "I 
want to talk to you about something very, very
 urgent.ﬂ He said, "Yes, come  and see me .ﬂ 
His office was not far from where I lived. As a ma
tter of fact, he had his office in his private 
home. I went to see. And this was an experien
ce that I'll never forget, because it was such an 
...such an anti-Semitic ma n. Uh, Rodriguez was 
his name, I do remember. I said, "Look, this 
is the situation. Jews are trapped in a small c
ity in Roma nia. And, uh, I want to bring them 
out. The only way I can bring them out if th
ey have  some  passports, some  documents, 
that...that they can...they can leave the country. 
As long as they can come , I want to bring 
them to Moscow. From Moscow, we will bring them somehow here, the same  as the 
refugees who are going from...between Yugoslavi
a and Moscow. From Moscow, I will bring 
him here to Japan. And then we will see what 
happens. But let's...let me get them out.ﬂ He 
says, "Well, what do you want? "   I said, "I n
eed passports.ﬂ "So? "  I said, "Well, I uh...I'd 
like to... I'll pay. I need passports.ﬂ He says
, "You Jews! You think you can do everything for 
money.ﬂ I said, "Look, I heard that it's possible to get passports from you. And you're a nice 
ma n, you're a kind ma n. Help them.ﬂ He says, 
"No.ﬂ I said, "Please! I beg you. Look, here 

are the pictures of the people. An old ma n with a white beard, and a woma n and two young 
ladies, girls. Save them. Let's save them. I'
ll pay!"  He says, "Will cost you.ﬂ I said, "How 
much? "   He says, "Six thousand dollars.ﬂ I said, 
"Mr. Rodriguez, have a heart. That's a lot of 
money.ﬂ In those days, it was a lot of money. It
 was a lot of money; but in my mi nd, I was 
ready. I said, "Well...ﬂ Not to be so uh quick in agreeing to his price. He says, "You see, you 
Jews. You want to help and save people. Wh
en it comes to money, you are stingy.ﬂ I said, 

"Mr. Rodriguez, please have a heart.ﬂ He sa
ys, "Alright. $4,000. You bring me  cash.ﬂ I have 
to smuggle out. Cash was not allowed. It wa
s black ma rket, you know. Just...but I ma naged. 

He said, "You must promise me. I'll give you th
ree passports. One's for the father. One for 
the mother, and one for the two girls.ﬂ They
 were under eighteen. "And when they come  
here...if you bring them here, you must promise me solemnly that you will return the 

passports to me.ﬂ I said, "Of course.ﬂ I said to 
myself in my hat, "I'll give them to you! Let 
them come. Then I'll worry about giving you th
e passports.ﬂ Anyway, I got the passports. 
And then I had a big problem. How do I send 
those passports out?  There was censorship. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090

Where do I--a stateless immi grant living in Japan--get hold... can get ahold of foreign 
passports?  What to do?  So on that pict
ure I showed you, that was Mr. 
Kondo (ph)
, a good 
friend of mi ne. He was a policeman in charge
 of Russian affairs. Spoke perfect Russian. 
Good friend. I came to see him. I said, "Kondo-san.ﬂ In Japanese, you don't say "Mister.ﬂ 

You say, "san," you know. And I said, "Kondo-san, I have a problem.ﬂ "What's the 

problem? "   I said, "My boss was here from Pana
ma , and he went to Chile. And he sent me  
passports for his family. And now I have to 
send them to occupied Bessarabia, which is 
occupied by the by the Soviets. Uh, Governme nt
 Soviet Republic. How do I go about it?  I...I 
want to make sure that they'r e going to get 
those...those passports, because then I will bring 
them over here.ﬂ He says, "Let me talk 
to my boss.ﬂ How cooperat...they were so 
cooperative. I... I... You know, I think about it now 
and I get shivers, because all those things 
that happened. Anyway, uh he came back. And he 
says, "Look.ﬂ And he spoke to his chief of 
his Russian section, Saito-san. And Mr. Saito 
says send those passports to the Japanese 

Ambassador in Moscow. Since Bessarabia is occ
upied by the Soviets, write a letter and ask 

the Consul to contact these people in the occupi
ed zone, Soviet zone, and tell them that he 
has passports for them. They should try and get out and come to Moscow, where he will give 

them those passports. Sounds good. I did it. And uh, unfortunately, a month later Hitler 

invaded Russia. And that was the 
end of it. They were destroyed.
5
 And they, uh... After the 
war, in 1947, Max came to Shanghai, where I lived. And he came, and he... And I kept 
copies of all the... First of all, it was his 
money that I spent to buy these passports, the 
passports. So I...I told him. He was crying like a child. He said, "It's my fault.ﬂ I said, "Max, 
no. I am a witness.ﬂ "Ich bin ein eydes,"
6
 I said, in Jewish. "You wrote to your father and to 
your mother and to your sisters to leave when
 they still had a chance. And...and they never 
left. I am a witness. Don't...don't...don't punish your
self.ﬂ And he was on the religious side. I 
said, "Let's go and see our rabbi.ﬂ Rabbi Ashkenazi was the rabbi of Shanghai. A very 

beautiful old ma n. And we went there, and I to
ld him the story. "Well," the rabbi told him, 
"look. Don't punish yourself. It's not your fault.
 Go to synagogue and say kaddish.ﬂ And uh 
that was it. But then--I'm jumping again. Because about ten years ago, I went to Venezuela 

on business. To Caracas. And Max was already 
married with children. He was there. And I 
uh wrote him a letter I am comi ng. He was so 
excited. Many years had gone by, and the last 
time I saw him was in 1947. And now I am talki
ng about 1973, or something like that. Thirty 
years. Thirty years went by. He's ma rried. He
 has grown-up children. Lives...he is a very 
very wealthy ma n. Lives in Caracas, Venezuel
a. I called him up. He came. He came to the 
hotel, and you can imagine what 
went on. He brought his son. His son... He says, "My son is 
going to be Bar Mitzvah next year.ﬂ I said, 
"Oh, how wonderful!"  They all spoke English 
and Spanish and Yiddish, of course. He says
, "You know what my son's name ? "   I said, 
"No.ﬂ "His name  is Leo.ﬂ You know, I was...I 
was flabbergasted. Yes. Yes. I said, "Oh, my

God!"  And uh he says, "By the way my wife's na
me  is Reva.ﬂ And that was my wife's  name . 
But that was a coincidence. But he wanted to tell me that he named his son for me, which 
was very, uh... And then we went to his house.
 Beautiful place. And nice family, nice good 
Jewish family. And I went to his bedroom. And th
ere on the table, the pictures of his father, 
his mother and his sisters. The ones that we
re destroyed in the camp. I said, "Max, do your 
children..."--a girl, eighteen, seventeen; and Leo 
was nearly thirteen. I said, "Do they know 
what happened to your children...to your parents 
and to your sisters? "  He said, "No. They 
know they were...they were uh destroyed by the...i
n the Holocaust.ﬂ I said, "Did you ever tell 
them that uh you tried your best to bring them 
here?  To bring them out of there?  And the 
only chance... Who knows?  And...but they wouldn'
t go.ﬂ He says, "No.ﬂ I said, "Max, you 
must...you must tell your children. Because child
ren today are different children than you 
were and I was. They mi ght think, 'Where wa
s my father, a very wealthy ma n and uh doing 
so well?  Maybe he didn't want to spend his 
money...'  Or something. You must tell them.ﬂ 
He says, "I can't .ﬂ I said, "Can I? "  He sa
ys, "Yes. Go ahead.ﬂ So I took those photographs, 
brought them to the dining room, put them on 
the table. And I said, "Children, do you know 
who these are? "  They said, "Yes, our grandfat
her and grandmother. They were destroyed in 
the...in the Holocaust.ﬂ I said, "Let me tell you 
something.ﬂ I said, "I am a witness. And your 
father was insisting that your great grandf
ather and your grandmother and your two aunts 
should come , should escape from there. But they
 wouldn't move.ﬂ And so they were crying 
and sad, but that's it. That's part of the Holocaust stories, one of them. That's what it is. 
 
Q: Let's go back to Kobe, and... We  have had a 
long, very important story, but bring it back to 
Kobe. How did you first get involved?  You were involved in the community... 
 
A: Yeah, we were an organized Jewish comm
unity, of which I was the secretary. And we 
started getting telegrams. First a telegram with
 a few name s in it. They were German Jews--
or maybe Austrian Jews, I'm not sure--that were 
at that time in Lithuania, and they got the 
visas to go. Some  of them went to Argentin
a, or somewhere else. All they needed was 
Japanese transit visas. Can we arrange Japane
se transit visas?  Uh, our president of our 
Jewish community--Anatole Ponve
7
--was a very fine, hard-working dedicated person. Uh he 
ran to the police and he talked to them about
 it. He says, "Look, there are six people. Here 
are there names.ﬂ They gave their names on the...on the telegram. And, uh, they said, "Well, 

what do you want? "   He said, "Let them 
come here. We guarantee, we the Jewish 
community, will guarantee their stay here. If th
ey need money, and the political--uh that they 
are not spies, or anything of that sort. Just 
allow them to enter through Japan to Kobe, and 

from here they will take a ship.ﬂ At that time there was...it was before Pearl Harbor. I'm 

talking about 1900... end of 1940, beginning of 1941. 
And, uh, they said, "OK.ﬂ So we sent 
them a telegram that the visas can be obtained at the Japanese consulate. They got it. But 
then the new story started, this Japanese
 consul in Lithuania--in...in...in Kaunas [
NB:
 
Kovno], Lithuania--who, as it was so very
 well written in this book, 
The Fugu Plan
... Uh, 
one of the rabbinical students was a uh a uh citi
zen of Netherlands. He was a Dutch citizen.

He studying in the Mir Yeshiva in...in...in Poland; and uh he went to see a Japanese...uh, the 
Dutch consul and said, "Look, uh, there is this 
Dutch colony, Curaçao, in We st Indies. And I 
want to go there.ﬂ And...and the Russians, the 
Russians already were in Lithuania. They 
occupied Lithuania at that time, became a L
ithuanian Republic. And he said, uh, "They will 
give me exit visa, and uh if I can get in visa 
where to go.ﬂ So he says, uh, "There is no need 
for visas to go to Curaçao. Anybody can go to Cur
açao.ﬂ He says, "What?  No entry visas? " 
"Yeah.ﬂ So he went back to the Russian aut
horities. I think that's how it worked. And says, 
"Look, I don't need any visas. I can go.ﬂ He says, 
"Show it. Prove it to us.ﬂ He went back to 
the Dutch consul; and the Dutch consul [he] told, "Look, give me a paper saying that 

according to the regulations  there is no need fo
r visas to enter Curaçao or Surinam in Dutch 
West Indies, and subject to the permission 
from the Governor, the Dutch Governor of 
Curaçao.ﬂ And he gave him that, he wrote it dow
n with a stamp. That was all he needed. He 
went there and said, "Here. I can go. Here is the 
stamp. Here is the proof that there is no need 
for a visa.ﬂ He says, "Alright. We will gi
ve you the exit visa. Ho
w are you going to go?" 
Need a Japanese transit visa to travel across 
Russia to Japan, and from Japan to take a boat, 
you see. So he went to the Japanese, and that's how it all started. The Japanese consul started 

to give them visas. They were standing th
ere... You know, news spread very fast. They 
started going, they were standing there day and ni
ght for their turn to get those visas. First 
the Dutch stamp, then the...the...the uh...the Ja
panese visa. And this ma n Sugihara, the 

Japanese consul, he got instructions from hi
s people in Tokyo, "Stop issuing visas.ﬂ But he 
didn't listen to them. He actually saved the people.
 I mean, part of the whole picture, you see. 
He was very important. Why did he do it?  I me
t him after the war in Japan, by the way. He 
uh...he said, "I don't think they can leave this c
ountry anyway. So let them have some peace 
of mi nd. I'll give them the visas.ﬂ Now with 
the Dutch consul, according to this book that I 
just brought to show it to you--the one written by the Rabbi
8
--the Dutch consul had a...a 
secretary. A German ma n, who eventually joined the German uh SA. The...the... You know. 
He...his job was to give to the consul the 
background of each uh...each person who applied 
for a Dutch, for that Dutch stamp, you see. A
nd uh uh he was a German; but he was very 
sympathetic to the Jews. And the reason is, according to this book, is he had a Jewish 

girlfriend when he was in Germany. (Laughte
r)  Another one, another angle. It's amazing. 
Uh... 
 
Q: Bring us back to you.  
 
A: Bring it back to me . So we 
were, we were the Jewish community. We were a small Jewish 
community, and we started working. We  orga
nized our ladies. My late wife was among 
them. Uh, hundreds of people started to co
me  in. Where do you put them?  You need 
housing. You need food. A representative of the 
Joint Distribution [Committee] sent their 
people to Japan, to Kobe. A representative of
 the Jewish organization HIAS sent their 
people. From Lithuania, they came to Japan; a
nd they were helping with money. At first, we 
put up our own money when a few people came.
 So there was very little to spend. You

know, transportation and food. But then, when hundr
eds started to come in, we just couldn't 
do it. So I sent a cable to the Joint Distri
bution Committee in New York saying uh what we 
are doing. So in the reply came--I'll never forget it as along as I live--"Money no object. Save 
Jews.ﬂ They imme diately sent $25,000. That wa
s a lot of money in those days. And...and 
since then, the representative of Joint cam
e; and they were put uh...you know, more and 
more people were comi ng in. 
 
Q: How did you arrange all... You've talked a
bout one route to bring Jews in. How did you 
arrange for other Jews to go in?  What were the arrangements for getting Jews in?  
 
A: They were getting Japanese visas, transit 
visas. They had Russian exit visas, which the 
Russians gave to them; and they sold them, th
ey allowed them to buy tickets only if they 
were paying. At first, they allowed them to 
use Russian money. Then they said you have to 
pay in dollars; so all the Jews had relatives so
mewhere in America, and also especially the 
religious. They...they organized themselves in 
New York with an organization called Va'a d 
Ha-Hatsala,
9
 "Organization of Saving," to...to... Hatsal
a is to save. And they were sending 
money. They were organizing everything. A
nd uh, of course, they had the documents 
already in order. They had the Japanese tr
ansit visa. They had the Dutch stamp. And the 
Russians gave them an exit; and that's all they
 needed. And the Japanese allowed them to 
come  and stay in Japan two weeks; but some  of
 them stayed as long as six months, you see. 
But that's enough of story. Why?  Why?  I...I... It
 has to do with what uh Rabbi Tokayer has 
made research in this book: they...they...the
y thought by helping the Jews, they would 
influence the uh top of people in America--President Roosevelt, etc. They needed help.  
 
Q: Get back to you. How did you get involved, and what did you do?  
 
A: I was secretary of the Jewish community. A
nd I used to go after wo
rk--five, six o'clock--
when I finished my work in regular office, 
business. Uh, was quite an active organization. I 
used to buy a lot of merchandise to ship in
to South America--uh, to Panama; to Central 
America, Panama , Curaçao, Peru, Chile. A
nd I would go every day to the Jewish 
community, and there were problems. There we
re so ma ny... there were so many people. We 
had to have meetings every day, uh... 
 
Q: Talk about the problems... 
 
A: What kind of problems. Uh, 
food. Three thousand people to feed. Uh, distribution of money. 
We organized a committee. We had some people from the refugees who started to work in 
the...in the various departments getting visas. Uh, 
they all applied to American consulate, to 
British consulate. Uh, as a matter of fact, th
e fifty young fellows volunteered to uh serve in 
the British Army; and we had to uh...uh, with th
e ...with the...working together with the 
British consul, we had to--uh, I don't know if this
 is the correct word--"smuggle" them out of

Japan, because Japan was an ally of Germany. And uh you couldn't do it. We  used to do it in 
a very unusual way. Uh, we had the name s of 
the people who wanted to enter the British 
Army. I would call up the British consul, meet hi
m in a bar and order a couple of beers. I 
would give him the name s, and he would arrange
 to have them assigned as, as a... as crew 
members on British uh cargo boats that were run...t
hat were sailing from Japan to India, to 
Singapore. And that's how they they left and 
ventured. Eventually, some  of my good friends, 
they were killed. Two of them were killed in 
Italy. They were in the British Army. Some of 
them joined the Polish Army that was in 
exile. And uh...and every day, the Japanese police 
would come  and ask. You'd have to talk to
 them and explain. What are you doing, and how 
are you doing. Uh, being a secretary and speaki
ng some  Japanese also, uh my ...one of my 
jobs was to keep all the documents of all the re
fugees - I will call them refugees - in a safe. 
They were not allowed even to go Osaka, whic
h was one hour by train. Not allowed to travel 
in Japan. And they couldn't buy a ticket on a tr
ain without presenting their documents. And 
these documents were under the community's...uh, lo
cked in a safe. And uh I'll never forget--
one day, two guys came in. One was a very m
ean man, as I told you. He studied 
Mein 
Kampf
, and he always used to argue with me  
about why do the Germans hate the Jews so 
much and all that. That's another story. A
nd uh uh he came to me ; and he said, "Look, we 
have uh...uh suspicions that among the refugees th
ere are some spies. Soviet spies.ﬂ I said, 
"As far as I'm concerned, all the Jews are Je
wish refugees. I mean, we'r e helping everyone. 
We don't ask who they are. What they are.
ﬂ He says, "Look, you get all the documents, all 
their passports, all their traveling documents.ﬂ
 I said, "Yes, sir.ﬂ "Well, if you see that 
the...the picture of the man and the picture 
on the passport are different, you report to us 
immediately.ﬂ I said, "I can't  do that. Ther
e are hundreds and hundreds of passports, and I 
can't  look at each other. Besides," I said, "t
he problem with...could come  without a beard, 
and he grew a beard. I didn't know
 if...ﬂ "You don't want to cooperate with us," they said to 
me. I said, "I'll cooperate with you, but I can't
 do that. I can't . I have no time to look...to look 
at each each passport and see who's there. So 
ma ny of them.ﬂ Anyway, they were angry at 
me . They left. What else could we do?  What 
did we do?  I mean, let's say my wife, as young 
as she was  - she was only 21, 22 - she was in
 charge of the children. There were about 
hundreds of children. And children would 
get sick. Children needed food. And, uh, 
children...it was winter sometimes. I mean, some of
 the months they were there, it was cold, 
the 
heating (ph)
 clothes. So they would run to her; a
nd she would take the child and go to the 
hospital. And the Japanese doctors were marvelous. We had a doctor, his name was--I 

forgot. I used to call him the...the uh...uh, "the 
rabbit doctor.ﬂ He had a couple of rabbits in 
his yard. So my son, who was three years 
old, called him "the rabbit doctor.ﬂ Anyway--
Yoshimura, Dr. Yoshimura. Marvelous ma n. He
 wouldn't take any money. My wife would 
come  with the mother of the child, and what
ever it was--dysentery. And lucky, lucky, lucky 
[that] there was no uh...no any kind of sicknesse
s or serious sicknesses among the people. 
After all, you know, the change of food, the change
 of water, the change of climate. And uh 
(laughter) ...it's remarkable. Getting homes. There were not many foreign homes. And there 

were hundreds of people. So they would get 
Japanese homes. They would rent them out. 
And then we would...it was very painful some tim
es to say, "Well, here you are. Here's a 
home.ﬂ And they... You know, the Japanese ta
tami --those uh straw ma ts. And we would 
fi gure out one straw mat for two people on th
e fl oor who had no pillows, no blankets, no

nothing. Everything happened so fast; but peopl
e were crying. People were upset. "But I'm 
this, and I'm that, and everybody put me  on the floor
" - was painful. It was painful. I'll never 
forget; one day, uh a lady came. She...they all decided, most of them decided they were 
going to go to Yokohama , to the American cons
ul; because the American consul in Kobe 
was not a very sympathetic ma n. They they had their own... 
 
Q: Who was the American Consul?  
 
A: He was Jewish. 
 
Q: OK. 
 
A: And he just died recently--Dr.... Uh, I forgot his name . 
 
Q: OK. 
 
A: I'll think of it. Anyway, so they used 
to go to Yokohama . Yokohama  was about overnight 
trip by train. They needed money to go on the tr
ain. Where did they get the money to go?  So 
I reme mber... I forget, I was...I was in the offi
ce; and a lady comes in with a child in her 
hands. She said, "I need money to go to Y
okohama.ﬂ I said, "We...the community does not 
have money for that purpose. The money we get from the Joint Distribution is for food, for 

clothing, for rent. For necessities, but not for 
travelling purposes.ﬂ "OK," she says. She had a 
bracelet. She says, "Here. Take this.ﬂ I sai
d...uh, I forgot her name ...I 
said, "This is not a 
pawn shop, ma dame . This is a Jewish commun
ity. I am sorry.ﬂ "Take my child.ﬂ You know, 
it was painful. And I...I...I... As young as I was, 
I only could cry at wh
at's going on. So what 
does one do?  I said, "How much is the ticket? "  
That was, that remained in my mi nd for all 
these years. I'll never forget that. Few from 
Czechoslovakia, I think. Uh...well, anyway, one 
night - another story - there's so much to 
do. It's hard to tell your problems, religious 
problems. And they would come  to me , because
 I spoke Yiddish and because they thought I 
was more sympathetic, to uh uh... I have to tell you 
this story. It's a very interesting one. Uh, 
three months before Passover, uh a delegati
on of rabbis--six... You know, they were very 

well organized, by the way, I must tell you. Ev
eryone. Not only the religious uh groups. The 
religious groups organized the Yeshivas and 
the ceremonies. But there were engineers. 
There were doctors. There were uh a couple of
 fellows working in...in...in Poland in mi nes, 
mi ne workers, whatever. They were orga
nized in groups. Journalists. And...and it was good, 
because if they would come to talk about so
me problems they wouldn't come all at once. 
They would send their representatives, and we
 would handle it in...in that way. So here 
come s six rabbis. And I said, "Yes? "   "Passover is comi ng, Herr Hanin.ﬂ "Yes, Passover.ﬂ 
"Was er zein...What will be with Matzahs, etc.? "  "Well, we'll do the sa
me thing like with us. 
We'r e a small Jewish community. We get our matzahs fr om the Jewish communities in 

Harbin, in Shanghai. They'r e baking ma tzahs.ﬂ "Those ma tzahs are not kosher for us. We 

must get matzahs from America.ﬂ "America?  
So what do you want with me ? "   "You must 
send a telegram. Here is the address. The orga
nization of the rabbis in New York. Tell them 

there are eight hundred Jews here that need
 matzahs.ﬂ "Unh uh. There are three thousand 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090 
13 
 
Jews that need ma tzahs.ﬂ "Oh, yes, yes, yes.
ﬂ Right away, I said, "There are three thousand 
and thirty. We are also Jews, if you're going to
 get matzahs.ﬂ So I sent a telegram. And uh 
about eight or ten weeks later, documents 
arrived at the community, addressed to me. 
Shipping documents. On a ship, ma tzahs. Wi ne, 
caskets of wine. Chocolate. Manischewitz. 
You know, stuff, everything is comi ng. Beautiful
. But that was three days before Passover 
the ship is arriving. We'r e in a hurry to get them cleared through the customs and get a 
permit, because imports to Japan was not allo
wed. You had to get a license. And we...I never 
thought we would get these things. So now...I 
never even thought of applying for a license, 
and here are the documents. So I run to the 
customs person, or the Bank of Japan - I don't 
reme mber where. Anyways, "Here. The shipme nt
 is comi ng in on such and such and such a 
boat in three days. A Jewish holiday, Passover, is comi ng; and we got matzahs.ﬂ "What's 
matzahs? "  I said, "Look, Jews are not allowed 
to eat any ordinary food. They can only eat 
this special food which American communities, Jewish communities are sending for our 
people here.ﬂ "This is not for resale? "   I said, 
"No, of course not. It is for us.ﬂ "OK. Wr ite a 
letter saying that you guarantee from the Jewish
 community that these food products are for 
distribution among the refugees and not for resa
le.ﬂ So I wrote the letter. We got a permit 
right away. Now, another problem. Two rabbis 
come in, and they said, "We have a big 
problem.ﬂ "What's the big problem? "   "Accord
ing to the orthodox, strict orthodox law, if a 
non-Jew touches the wine, it's not kosher. We  
can't ... You want us to drink Pesach wine, 
don't you, Mr. Hanin? "  I said, "Y
es, of course.ﬂ "So you have to find a way.ﬂ I said, "How 
can I go and tell the Japanese customs...uh, the guy 
in charge, that his people are not allowed 
to touch? That's an insult!
"  "You will fi nd a way.ﬂ I said, "OK. Come  tomorrow.ﬂ And I 
ma de an appointme nt with the Chief of the 
Customs. "And come  tomorrow in your shtayim-
-hats.ﬂ And [these] guys with long beards. "We'll 
go.ﬂ We  went to see the Chief of Customs. 
Very, very polite. Very, very nice. I came to
 him, and I said, uh, "You know we'r e Jewish 
people here.ﬂ "Oh, yes," he said. "I saw in the papers.ﬂ I said, "You see, these two are very 
learned people. They are rabbis. You see, I am 
also a Jew, but I am not like them. They are 
special people. They are holy people.ﬂ "Ah, 
so!"  You know. "What can I do for you? "  I 
said, "You know this wine caskets, wine come  
in. Can you please allow that I or one of the 
rabbis will go there and open the...and pour some  wi
ne out in a bottle? It 
will be a sample to 
the customs inspector to see what...he has to examine what it is. But I will do it.ﬂ As a matter 
of fact, I said, "I cannot do it. The rabbis must 
do it. It is holy wine.ﬂ He looks at me . He 
believed me. I said [to myself], "What am I ta
lking about? "   But I have to do it. And he 
allowed it. As I was leaving his place, he called 
me back. He said, "Hanin-san, come back.ﬂ I 
says, "Yes? "   "I want to try that wine. What
 does it taste like? "  "Of course. Of course.ﬂ I 
sent him wine. I sent him matzahs. I sent him 
a whole bunch of stuff. (Laughter)  It was cute. 
Anyway, they had a good Pesach. 
 
Q: That's wonderful. What year was this?  
 
A: That was in '41. 
 
Q: Just before Pearl Harbor?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090

A: ...very uh very unusual story. Uh, when the wa
r was over and uh we knew...we started to get 
this information. And, you know, it's...it's...it's difficult, it's painful. I mean, I suppose this 
will be with us... I don't know if
 it will be with the next ge
neration, but with us it will. 
Actually, it was not witnessing it; because, luckil
y, we were not there. We were in another 
part of the world. But it touched us. And uh a 
friend of mi ne, Brandt was his name , he was 
among the refugees. He came. He lived in Israel
. He came here for a visit. It was about ten 
years ago. And uh he called me  up. And uh I kept 
in contact with some of them. We became 
really friends, and some  of them worked fo
r the community. We...we had, those...those that 
spoke English. Some  of them spoke good Englis
h. One of them became uh uh speaker of the 
Knesset, yes. Uh, Menachem Savidor. His name  
was Hodorowski. He just died last year in 
Israel. Anyway, uh so Brandt 
came in. And we...we went to a Chinese restaurant and we 
were sitting and talking. And he says--oh, he was always... Never, never me. He says, "I 
want to thank you.ﬂ I said, "Don't thank me . 
We  did...you would have done the same  for me . 
Anyway, that's not important.ﬂ I says, "You know," I says, "I'll tell you, uh uh...Chiel.ﬂ 
Yechiel was his name. "Uh, many times," I said, "I would wake up at night, and I had a...a...a 
feeling of a little bit of a guilt.
ﬂ He says, "What's the matter?"  I says, "You know, I have to 
tell you the truth. There were times we woul
d hold up the action. We  would see...have a 
telegram, says, 'Six hundred people are ready to
 go.'  So we would hold it for two weeks, 
because there's no homes. We have to prepar
e ourselves. We have to get ready. And we 
would hold up our action, and it...it bothered 
me.ﬂ I said, "Sometimes I would say, 
'Maybe...maybe if we didn't hold up the acti
on, we could have saved ma ybe six hundred 
Jews more.'"  He says, "Leo, sleep quiet.ﬂ I sa
id, "Well, how can you tell me that? "   He says, 
"I was the last one.ﬂ "How can you be the last one? "   He said, "Well, let me tell you this 
story.ﬂ So, then I have to go to this young ma
n over here, god bless him. I have to show it 
over here. (Holding picture to side)  This is the Amshenover Rebbe.

Q: OK. Now, hold it in front of you. 
 
A: (Muffled)  Uh, Brandt, the ma n who tells me  not to worry... 
 
Q: Hold it up a mi nute. 
 
A: Who told me not to worry... Is that better?  
 
Q: Alright. 
 
A: He says to me ... Uh, he [
NB:

had to go and apply for a Russian exit [visa], th
en he needed somebody to translate for them. 
Because the Russians...the Russians uh uh set up this station where they had a Russian

commi ssar. You know, in charge of the Jewi
sh affairs, of the Jewish uh exit visas 
departme nt. A Russian ma n, and he only spoke 
Russian. So when they had to go and apply 
for these...for the visas, uh, they had to speak
 Russian. So Brandt s
poke Russian. The rabbi, 
the one that I show you the picture, he didn't 
speak any Russian. Yiddish. So he asked Brandt 
to go and translate for him. So they came in
; and the...the Commi ssar says, "Yes. What can I 
do for you? "  So he says, "Rebbe, was was...z
ogum was du wilt."--"What do you want?"  He 
says, "Zogum."--"Tell him.ﬂ [Phrase in Yiddish]. So he says, "Tovarish."--"Comr ade

in Russian]--"He is asking for a visa.ﬂ "Oh. 
Tell him to show me the documents.ﬂ He sa
ys, "Rebbe, dokumenten.ﬂ So the rabbi takes it 
and he puts it on the table. And he [the Commi
ssar] says, "Alright, I will look at them. And 
come tomorrow. If everything is all right, I 
will give him the visa.ﬂ And rabbi doesn't  go 
away. So he says to me ...he says to him, 
"What else? " --"Rebbe, was nocht? "   [Phrase in 
Yiddish]--"What do you need? "   He says, "Z
ogum."--"Tell him.ﬂ [Phrase in Yiddish]--"He 
should give a visa to my brother.ﬂ He says, 
"Comrade Commi ssar, uh, he is asking for a visa 
for his brother.ﬂ He says, "Well, let his brother come with his documents, and I'll take a look 
at them. And if everything is all right, I'll give
 him the visas.ﬂ And the rabbi sits. And there 
are hundreds of people waiting 
outside, you know. The Commi ssar gets impatient. He says, 
"Well?  What else does the Rabbi need here? "   He says, "Rebbe, vas nocht? "   He says, 

"Zogum."--"Tell him.ﬂ [Phrase in Yiddish]--to Brandt--"He should give 
you
 a visa.ﬂ And 
Brandt, he says...Brandt says, "I got very ne
rvous, because my document was a false one and 
I was scared to even to show it to them.ﬂ 
So the Commi ssar says, "Well?  Documents? "  He 
says, "My documents are at the hotel. I will bring them tomorrow.ﬂ And the rabbi sits. 
The...the Commi ssar gets very angry; and he sa
ys to him, "What else does the Rabbi wants? " 
"Rebbe, vas nocht? "   So he says to him, 
"Zogum."--"Tell him.ﬂ [Phrase in Yiddish]; which 

means, "Tell him he 
himself
 should take a visa and run away
 from here.ﬂ This guy, who was 
Jewish, understood every word. He started 
to laugh. He laughed and he laughed and he 
laughed and he hardly stopped. As a ma tter of 
fact... That's what Brandt told me . I don't 
know if it's true or not. But uh he says uh...uh th
ey found out later that he was arrested. He 
was helping the Jews very much. He was...he 
was a Zionist; but he pretended to be a big 
Communist. And they found out, and...and they a
rrested him and shot him. That's what 
Brandt told me . And after that, the whole 
thing stopped. And uh...the whole station. It was 
just before the Russians... 
 
Q: What was the Commi ssar's name?  
 
A: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if it's tr
ue or not. But...but this is the story. Now 
again talking about this rabbi, which was very
 interesting... One story I'll never forget. We 
were...uh, we put him up. He had a big large fa
mily. And, you know, the...the rabbis of small 
cities, they had their own entourage. The sha
mmos, people who assist them, to help them; 
and he had a whole group of about twenty of 
them. So we...we...we were lucky to hire, to 
rent a home in the mountains somewhere, whic
h is about half an hour
 by train from Kobe. 
We set him up there. We had a lot of respect fo
r him. He was going to be there. We'll supply 
with the food, and everything will be alright. 
And we had me etings every night of the 
community, of the committee. Too ma ny problems were comi ng up, decisions, money 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090 
17 
 
problems, etc. etc. And one night we were s
itting in the meeting, and suddenly they come in 
and they call me. And they said, "The rabbi is 
here, and wants to talk to you.ﬂ Ten o'clock at 
night, which was very unusual. I got worried maybe he's sick, or something. I run out, and he 
sits there. He used to call me Leibl, in
 Polish pronunciation "Leib.ﬂ "Leo...Leibl.ﬂ "What 
happened? "  He says, "I came here to ask you 
a question.ﬂ I said, "What is the question?  
Ask.ﬂ "We are Polish citizens.ﬂ "Yes, yes.ﬂ "We are allied with the British.ﬂ "Yes.ﬂ "We are 

at war. They are at war. What would have ha
ppened if instead of three thousand Polish Jews 
they would have been English people?  What 
would have happened? "  So one of my...one of 
my uh co-workers, Dr. Moiseef - he also came out
 with me  - he was uh... He says, "Well, if 

you were British, the British would have sent a 
ship after you and would have taken you out 
fr om here to one of the British colonies.ﬂ At 
that time it was India. It was Australia. It was 
Canada. They were all British colonies, at that
 time. He says, "That's the whole point. We 
must insist that they should send a ship after us
. Ships. And take us out of here. We  are their 
allies.ﬂ "So...so what do you want from me ? "  
 "You, Leibl, you will go with me  to the 
Consul tomorrow and translate and request for ships.ﬂ I said, "Rabbi, you read the papers, 

don't you? "  He said, "Yes.ﬂ That was during th
e time when the British had to retreat from 
the uh from... What's that French port?
11
  Do you reme mber they were bombed out, like 
very, very severely?  
 
Q: Yes. I don't quite reme mber but I know what you mean. 
 
A: Uh, I said, "I don't think... Even if they wanted
 to do it, they have no ships. Now is war.ﬂ He 
says, "Never mi nd. You go with me  and you w
ill translate.ﬂ So, next day I called up the 
British Consul. I...I...I met him a couple of tim
es, because of this situation with the young 
fellows who volunteered for the British army. And, uh, I said, "Look, I am going to bring a 

rabbi who is - I don't know if you ever saw uh 
these people who are still are in the 17th, 18th 
century, with the way they are dressed, the way 
they are wearing with the beards and with 
the fur hats.ﬂ It's August. It was hot. I said, 
uh, "I...I'd like you to meet him.ﬂ He says, "Fine. 
What time will he come?  Just call me, and I will
...I will escort him myself.ﬂ So I called him 
before, he came to my office. We  took a taxi
. We went there. I called him. I called the 
Consul. He came down. The Consulate was on th
e sixth floor. He came down. He me t him. 
Wa s very very... You know, we always thought th
e British were so uh high-falutin'--a consul 
and all that. We went upstairs. "Yes. What 
can I do for you, Rabbi? "   So I told him, the 
rabbi, "He wants to know what's the purpose of
 your visit.ﬂ Well, he repeated the whole 
story about being allies with with the Britis
h and a Polish citizen, etc. So the guy was 
smoking his pipe. He said, "Yes, yes. That's a 
very reasonable request. I will have to transmit 
it to the to His Majesty's Ambassador.ﬂ At that
 time, it was King George the VI in England; 
in Tokyo,  his [Ambassador's] name  was Robert 
[Granger (ph)]
, I believe. "And uh you will 
hear from him, hopefully.ﬂ You heard; and 
the rabbi was satisfied, and everybody. That was 
the story of the rabbi.

NB:
 Dunquerque?

Q: That's a lovely story. This is also again in 1940, before '41, I would say. 
 
A: Oh, of course. It was 1941, I believe. Yes. 
By the way, I have to tell you a point, very 
interesting. Uh so when we were talking to
 the rabbi the night before, I said, "Rabbi, 
supposing it's all right. Supposing it works. 
Who knows?  Where would you want to go?  
There's so many British colonies.ﬂ He says to
 me, "Jamaica.ﬂ I said, "Rabbi...ﬂ Frankly, I 
didn't even know where Jamaica was, at that tim
e. I heard the name Jamaica, but I couldn't 
imagine in my mi nd on the map where it was. He says, "For us, Jamaica.ﬂ "Why not 
Australia?  Why not Canada? "   He says, "The
 climate is a good the climate, a very good 

climate.ﬂ I went home. I took...I had an atlas. I 
said [to myself], "Jamaica is very close to 
New York. And he thought if they'll get to Jama i
ca, it maybe would be easier for them to get 
to New York.ﬂ He didn't want to say that, but 
I think that's what he had it in mi nd. (Laughter) 
 Anyhow... 
 
Q: Show us your photographs, would you pl
ease?  You brought photographs with you and 
there's one that has particular, two that have particular... 
 
A: I...I... In my mi nd, this particular photograph is very very ...uh I'd like to call it historical 
because the whole episode is historical. 
Historical . . . (TEC
HNICAL CONVERSATION) 
like our like our Jewish people are concerned. Se
e, this is a farewell dinner for Mr. Ponve--
who is leaving for uh...who is leaving for the United States. And uh . . . 
 
Q: Mr. Ponve is who?  
 
A: Ponve, he was the president of our commun
ity. Mr. Ponve. P-O-N-V-
E. Anatole Ponve. He 
lived here in Los Angeles afterwards. He pa
ssed away a few years ago. Uh, the Japanese 
people that are sitting around the table and some 
of them are standing are representatives of 
various Japanese government institutions. One wa
s the governor of the state where we were. 

The uh Prefecture - they call it "P
refecture" - where Kobe was. The others were all working 
for the Japanese police, but some  of them... 
This gentlemen here was representative of 
Japanese governme nt. Anyway to ma ke a long 
story short, he told Mr. Ponve, "You are 
going to America. We  want you to tell the Amer
ican Jews over there, who are your brothers, 
how good the Japanese government is to your pe
ople here. How we actually helped to save 
their lives. How we allowed them to stay in Japan. We  gave them visas to come  here. And 

we want Jews in America to know about this, and you tell them about us.ﬂ That, in my mi nd, 
was the the the basic thought of the Japanese--tha
t the the people in America, the Jewish, our 
people in America are very very influential. 
And they can influence the higher people in the 
government, and even the President Roosevelt 
himself, to help them with uh with uh 
arranging matters. So that uh uh they will help th
em to settle the war in China. The Japanese 
were getting deeper and deeper towards China, 
and they had no way of getting out of there. 
And uh America has uh has uh prohibited the sale 
of metals and oil to them, started to put 
economic sanctions on them. And they were havi
ng a much much harder time at that time. 
So I feel that's the...that's the historical a
ngle. What they were aimi ng at. It didn't work, 
because uh the Japanese were allies with Germany and they were occupying China; and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090 
19 
 
the...the sentiment over here was... 
 
Q: Show us some  of your other photographs. 
 
A: Now this is the...this is the Jewish comm
unity. This is the group of people that were 
working. (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) These ar
e various activities. The refugees used 
to come for their mail, and they used to co
me with their problems. And people would take 
care of them and uh we would try to solv
e all their problems whatever they were. 
(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION)  U
h, our ladies, our wives were also uh helping in uh in 
all the matters that were needed for the refug
ees; with their clothes and their food and their 
medical problems and their housing and uh living 
conditions. And so the ladies got together 
and organized a committee, our ladies. My wife is one of the ladies there. 
 
Q: Point out your wife there. 
 
A: My wife is here, right here
. Here; and then she's here. They'r e getting various clothes for the 
children, collecting, yes, and uh so. These are various activities. There were hundreds and 

hundreds of pictures that were taken. 
 
Q: You have a picture in there, the big one, uh where there's a gentlemen in a black Japanese 
cap. You said there was a particular story about him. 
 
A: Oh, the rabbi. This one here. 
 
Q: That's your rabbi. 
 
A: That's what I told you about, the story. Jamaica. That's him. 
 
Q: That's the rabbi. 
 
A: And this was one of those rabbis--these two 
of them, as a matter of fact--came to see me 
about the matzahs, about getting the matzahs and wine through the customs and all that. This 

is one of them. They were very active. These 
are the Japanese gentlemen--Dr. Kotsuji, and 
Captain Fukamachi--who were very very helpfu
l. They...they did a lot of work. Uh as a 
ma tter of fact, Kotsuji spoke Hebrew and he conve
rted to Judaism. He was, yes, very very 
helpful. Did a lot of work for us. And uh he wa
s buried in uh in Jerusalem, yes. He was very 
very helpful. (TECHNICAL CONVE
RSATION)  Now, what else?  
 
Q: Tell us what happened after Pearl Harbor. 
What difference did it make in the way the 
community functioned?  
 
A: Uh, well, as far as the refugees are concer
ned, in August, I believe--this was four months 
before Pearl Harbor--all of a sudden Japanese military took over all the affairs. Until that 

time, their affairs, their arrangements, their visa
s, the extensions of the visas, the permits to 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090 
20 
 
stay, were handled by the police. By the prefect
ure of police in Kobe. And then in August, 
after the Japanese occupied in to China, 
I believe, the things changed. The military came 
over and they took over. And...and they came to
 us, and they said, "We give you uh two 
weeks," I think, "to get them all out of here. 
All to Shanghai.ﬂ And then the immi gration, the 
moveme nt of the refugees to China, they ga
ve ships; and by the hundreds they left. A few 
were still left, about six, you know, were left a 
little later. But all eventually had to go. And 
by the time Pearl Harbor...of Pearl Harbor, there 
were no more refugees left in Shanghai--in, 
uh, Kobe. They were all in Shanghai. We  stayed there.  
 
Q: How did you stay, and what... Why did you stay, and what was it like for you?  
 
A: Well, I was...I had a job. I was working th
ere, and uh business was going on. I me an, I was 
buying me rchandise and shipping. And uh when 
the war came uh, what do to?  I mean, I...my 
home. I had my wife, my child. And uh stay
ed there, and uh you couldn't do any more 
business. Everything was closed. The war star
ted. My firm--which was a Panamanian firm--
a Panama nian consulate was closed, because Pa
nama  declared war on Japan. So I was left 
without a job, without any money, without a
nything. Without doing any business, I had to 
think of some  way of continuing my liveli
hood. So my family, my parents, were in 
Shanghai; and uh I knew there were a lot of 
Jewish communities in Shanghai. A lot of 
people. Where they lived, they are making a liv
ing. I will do it. So... As a ma tter of fact, as 
far as I'm concerned, they came once. And uh one
 of these fellows was a very me an mean. 
He was a real...he was...he was, he grew up on 
Mein Kampf
. He used to always to talk to me 
about 
Mein Kampf
, and he was very unpleasant. As a ma tter of fact, one day he came and he 
spoke to me . And he says, "Why...why is it the German people hate the Jews so much? "  
And his name  was Osakabe. I said, "Mr. Os
akabe, are you asking me this question as a 
policeman, or as a friend? "  "As a friend.ﬂ I 
said, "Well, why are you talking to people who 
like Japanese?  You know, [there are] some  pe
ople who don't like the Japanese too much.ﬂ 
He jumped. He said, "What do you mean? "   I said, "Now, don't get excited. Don't get sore. 
You're talking like a friend. You're not talki
ng to me like a policeman now.ﬂ I said, "Is it 

true? "   He said, "Yeah, it's true.ﬂ I said, "Why? "  "Well, uh we are smart people.ﬂ I said, "We 
are also smart people.ﬂ Yeah, as young as I was. Maybe it was stupid to say that, but I was 
very angry. And then about a couple of weeks la
ter, they came and they said, uh, "We want 
to ask you a question.ﬂ "Yes.ﬂ There was another, he was a major in the Japanese Army. 
"And don't tell me  you have no answer. Y
ou...we know you are intelligent young ma n. You 
read books, etc. etc.ﬂ I said, "Yes. What's 
your question? "  "Uh, who is going to win the 
war? "  I said, "I can't  answer this question to
 you.ﬂ "Well, you are not an American. You're a 
stateless person. Tell us the truth, what you thi
nk.ﬂ I said, "I'll tell you in my own way.ﬂ I 
said, "I don't want Germany to win the war.ﬂ He said, "Why? "  "Because I'm Jewish. And I 
know how Germany is treating the Jews.ﬂ "Y
eah, clever answer. Uh, well, we recomme nd 
that you leave Japan.ﬂ So the recommendation wa
s taken, and I left. Took my wife, my child, 
on the boat. Wa s a dangerous journey, b
ecause by boat 48 hours, because American 

submarines we knew were around there. But uh I'm here. I ma de it.  
 
Q: What happened when you got to Shanghai?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090 
21 
 
 
A: You know, when I got to Shanghai, uh Shangha
i was an open ma rket. Uh a lot of Chinese 
people and there was a lot of merchandise that was there in the warehouse uh from before the 
war. People would import. And uh I was...I star
ted to be like a salesman, selling textiles and 
here and there; and life was very very inexpens
ive. For about thirty, forty dollars a month in 
US dollars, you could live well with food and w
ith everything. Wa s very very cheap. So we 
ma naged, we lived... 
 
Q: Did you get involved in the Jewish community in Shanghai?  
 
A: No, I couldn't. I just couldn't. It was...there 
was a lot of work to be done. There were twenty 
thousand Jewish refugees, and besides the Po
lish Jews that came  from Japan. Uh it was 
handled very well. They had committees orga
nized by the Sephardic Jews, and by their own 
people; and they were handling it. It was rough. 
The representatives of Joint were there, and 
uh uh they did a little work. We didn't have to
 get homes for them. Uh, it was a lot of 
difficulties because in in 1943 I believe it was,
 the Japanese--under the pressure of the 
Germans--have uh...have put the Jews that cam
e to Shanghai after 1937, put them in the 
ghettos, in specified areas which was terrible di
fficult conditions. We were not subject to that 
law, because we came to Shanghai before 1937. 
It was only those that came after 1937. They 
were smart. They didn't say German Jews or Po
lish Jews or Austrian Jews that were kicked 
out by the Germans or that fled from Germa
ny and Poland as Jews. They said those that 
came after '37, which was understood. That was those applied to the German Jews. 
 
Q: Uh, I'm confused. You said that you, that wh
en you came from Kobe it was after '41 and the 
war had started . . . 
 
A: Yes, I came in February of 1942. 
 
Q: But you then just said that you were not put
 into the ghetto uh because you came before '37. 
And, of course, that's not true, but... You mean
 because you were in, under Japanese control 

before '37?  
 
A: No. The...the, after 1941, the Japanese took over Shanghai. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: You know, Shanghai had different concessions
. It had the British Concession, the French 
Concession. And the...and the people that had ta
ken those concessions not, except those that 
were stateless people, but under the protection 
of the consulates. We, the stateless people, 
were again under the the Chinese people that were, they they were in charge of our situation. 
See, and we had a Jewish community which wa
s working together with the Chinese. And uh, 
when the proclamations came out, it applied to the Jews that came to China after 1937.  
 
Q: To all of China, and that included Kobe as
 part of that...China under Japanese control... 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090 
22 
 
 
A: They came to Shanghai. They were in Shanghai. Those who came to Shanghai after '37. 
 
Q: So what did you do?  You were outside of 
the ghetto. How did you live during those years?  
 
A: As I told you, we were doing, buying and selli
ng and ____. My father, as a ma tter of fact, 
had a uh a wholesale business in textiles. And I was helping him and uh making a living. 
 
Q: Can you describe - the two communities were very different.  
 
A: Which two communities? 
 
Q: In the ghetto and outside the ghetto. Ca
n you describe, can you explain some  of the 
differences to us?  
 
A: Well, the...the...the Jewish people that were put in the ghettos were confined. They had no no 
rights. They had to get a permit to get out of
 there to come and conduct their business and go 
to their jobs. See, we were free to move wh
ere ever we wanted to. We  didn't...in Shanghai 
that is. We didn't have to have any uh special 
permits to do that; and uh they lived in in the 

heims, which was the...they lived in the very
 best situation. They were taken care of by, 
money was being uh, funds were comi ng 
from America through Switzerland, through 
Sweden. Things were being - I don't know exactly
 how it was done but they were, they were 
in a very bad situation. Very very difficult situation. 
 
Q: What happened to you and for you when the war ended?  
 
A: When the war ended?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Uh, when the war ended a big ma rket opene
d up. China was a big ma rket. And uh and I got 
my, I established my contacts with my friends that I used to work for in Japan. The same 
people that I told you about--Max Pecker. And he
 was in New York at that time. Luckily, I 
sent him a telegram and he started sending 
me rchandise to me. And I was doing very well 
from 1947, 1948. I was doing good business. But th
en the Communists started advancing, 
and uh we knew we had to leave. So uh the 
Israeli government--at that time the State of 
Israel was established in 1948--they sent a repr
esentative, and they they registered us. And 
800 of us registered together, a
nd they sent a ship for us and took us out. And they took us to 
uh, afterwards more people left. Some  went to
 Harbin, went to Hong Kong. They sent ships 
after them to Hong Kong. Then they organized
 even planes. They had B-29's that were 
flying uh refugees to Israel. So uh, when we 
went from uh Shanghai to Israel in 1948, in 
December of 1948, there were 800 of us on a ship
 that could take only 600 or so. It was a 
crowded ship. It  wasn't  as bad as the 
Exodus
, that we saw in the movies, but it was tough. 
And we had to go 54 days to travel, because the Suez Canal was closed. Uh, there was war 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0090 
23 
 
with Egypt. We  had to go to Singapore, from 
Singapore to South Africa, around the Cape to 
Italy. And in Italy we got off that ship and the 
Israeli government sent a ship after us and we 
went to Haifa. Fifty-four da
ys it took. It was a rough journey. 
It was some thing. One day, if I 
ever write a book about it, it's...it's a very unusual trip. 
 
Q: Do you want to tell us a story from that trip?  
 
A: Huh?  
 
Q: Tell us a story from that trip. 
 
A: We  were comi ng from Singapore. It was wh
at nine days. The weather was rough. Some  of 
our people organized themselves in a group that
 was sending things on the ship because we 
had about uh out of eight hundred and sixty pe
ople we had about eight
y or a hundred very 
orthodox Jews, who wouldn't eat anything. And th
ey were just just drinking tea and...and 
bread; because it was not kosher you know. I mean
 to say, who could think about kosher on 
a refugee ship? So uh the committee got together
 and decided - there's a Jewish community 
in Singapore - they knew them. Sephardic Jews. Send them a telegram and uh telling we are 
on our way to Israel, Jewish refugees on the way to Israel, to the new St
ate of Israel. And we 
have people who need kosher food. W
ill they be able to help us? They sent it to them. As we 
arrived in Singapore, I'll never forget it. I was on the deck; and uh we were not allowed, the 

ships were not allowed to berth because th
e British--it was British at that time still, you 
know, before Singapore became independent--and 
uh we had to drop anchor some where far 
away because, I don't know, to to to get some  mo
re uh whatever they needed to run the ship, 
oil or whatever. And uh uh I was walking on th
e deck; and suddenly I see a Chinese junk, a 
large Chinese junk, sailing toward the ship. I 
had the binoculars. I looked. And there was a 
uh darkish man with a beard and a beret, 
look like a Sephardic Jew. And uh old junk, 
Chinese junk, comi ng towards the ship. I said, 
uh, "Who are you? "  He says, "I am from the 
Jewish community.ﬂ He says, "You need kos
her food? "  I said, "Yes.ﬂ I said, uh, "Good. 

What do you think (ph).ﬂ He says uh, there 
were about two hundred baskets with live 

chickens, live chickens. When we talk about kosher food, we thought--I don't know--sausage 
and cheese. I said, "Don't you have anything else
? "   He says, "Look, we are a small Jewish 
community. Climate is very hot here. We don't ha
ve sausages or cheese. There are chickens. 
You can have some body to ma ke them kosher, 
and then they will ma ke soup and whatever 
they need.ﬂ "OK.ﬂ So we got those basket
s and brought on the ship; and then our people 
called the representatives of the religious gr
oup - there were some rabbis among them - some 
people who knew how to...to...to cut the chicke
ns. Said, "Look, we got
 about a few hundred 
chickens. Organize yourselves and get them a
ll...cut them in the proper way. Then cook 
them, and that will be your food for the next
 couple of weeks.ﬂ "OK.ﬂ We  can, what do you 
want now. I don't know how they organized. It 
was like a conveyor rail line. There was men 
on this side. Three of them were cutting. 
Then they were sending them down. And, you 
know, according to the Jewish law you're not allo
wed to scald the chickens. You had to flick 
them. You see, at the end, there were six 
women or so; and they were flicking them. 
And...and then the ship...at six o'clock in the ev
ening, the ship was on its way with our next

stop South Africa. And all of a 
sudden, all these feathers started going up in the air, into the 
funnel of the ship. (Laughter)  Wh
ere the classy (ph) captain - was a Greek captain -  he took 
a uh one of those me gaphones, and he said, "I gi
ve you ten mi nutes to get that stuff cleaned 
up, or I'll send my people with the hose--water
 hoses--and everything will go overboard.ﬂ So 
some body ran to him, and explained to him what 
it was. He said OK, I'll give you a half an 
hour. Within a half an hour everything was OK,
 and they had food. (Laughter)  But then 
come s South Africa. South Africa was ma rvel
ous. The Jews in South Africa--the most 
remarkable, hospitable, fine, heart-warming, w
onderful people. We sent them a telegram, 
also. On the way to Israel. "We have children. We have old people, this and that.ﬂ And about 
five o'clock in the morning, Capetown is a b
eautiful city. It's just like Honolulu with the 
mountains. Gorgeous. So uh, I had three children, we had three children then. Two of my 
youngest children - one of them was one year 
old, then he was one year old - and I was 
allowed by the captain to go to my wife's - th
e children were in the women's section - men 
were in another place. I was allowed to go and 
take. Because my wife was very sick on this 
ship - she couldn't take it. For 21 days, she 
couldn't lift her head. Wa s rough. Anyway, so I 
was allowed to take - for a man to go into th
e wome n's section and take the children out. And 
I would take the...you know, little boy out; and he 
had a little carriage tied up on the deck. So 
put him in the carriage, you know. And as I wa
s strolling him on the deck, we arrived in 
Capetown. It was still dark in the morning. I sa
id, "Well, they must be working people. You 
know, come  to work at the docks.ﬂ They came 
closer. Jewish flags - hundreds of Jews - it 
was unbelievable. I said ______  it's you know it's 
so loud. And then started - we weren't 
allowed to go on shore. "What do you need? "   
And...and from eight in the morning until six 
in the afternoon, until we left, there were trucks
 and trucks and trucks bringing stuff - toys, 
food, ma gazines, me dicines, potatoes, uh canne
d stuff, chocolates, anything. And uh it was 

all taken out. It was, it was remarkable. I'll neve
r forget it as long as I live. As a matter of 
fact, about eight years ago I had to on business 
in South Africa. And I went to the newspaper 
uh that covered this arrival, this ship; and ther
e were pictures and so forth, and I told them 

that I was on that ship. They dug out from thei
r files what happened uh thirty years ago, and 
they found it. And I said, "Look, I am not uh... Nobody has given me  the authority, but 
please accept our thanks, from all of us I'm 
sure, for what you've done for us.ﬂ Lovely 
people. So that's...that's...that's the 
Coast of Victory
, was the name  of the ship. 
 
Q: Alright, Mr. Hanin. Is there anything that 
you want to add?  Anythi
ng that you want to...any 
story that you want to tell that you haven't told, anything that you want to say. 
 
A: Well, what shall I add? There are many other 
things that happened. Some  of them were not 
so very pleasant that I would rather not talk 
about it. Because uh there were accusations that 
the Jewish community of Kobe stole money. Uh, it was painful because we gave our hearts, 
we gave our our efforts, we gave everythi
ng we had to help. But some  people... You know, 
you always have that kind of people. 
 
Q: Can you tell us a little about that?  
 
A: It was just rumors. They would never come and and openly tell us. 
I was always going and

talking to them. But then when the time came 
for them to go to Shanghai, when we got 
orders that everybody has to go to Shanghai, ther
e was always very painful, who goes first. 
Nobody wants to go. Everybody, some one is waiting w
ith visas to go to South America; or, 
you know, they were applying for visas to go. 
_____ of the world. Brazil, Argentina. And uh 
also the...the unpleasant thing that I found, one of the things, was that the mi ssionaries took 

advantage of some  of the people. They came a
nd they spread the words; and some  of the 
people, they promised them visas if they w
ould convert to Christianity. Uh, and some  did. 
Uh I saw...I saw them going to the church, and 
it's none of my business. People do what they 
want to do. Until one day, I came to the communit
y. And there was a man with a bible in his 
hand, an American mi ssionary, preaching from th
e bible. I said--uh, in what language he 
spoke, German, I think--I said, "What are you doing 
here? "   He says, "Well, I can do what I 
want.ﬂ I said, "Look, you have taken advantage 
of people who are uh uh desperate, who need 
visas, who are... who are run away from a terri
ble war. I don't think it's the right thing to do. 
You want them to," I said, "come to church
 or whatever. They want to go, I cannot stop 
them. But you cannot come  to our Jewish comm
unity here and...and preach the bible. I don't 
think it's the right way to do it.ﬂ He agreed with me. He was a very nice man. Came to my 
house and we had a long talk. But then, you know, when all of them went to Shanghai, uh 
remarkable, remarkable people how they coul
d adapt themselves with the Polish group. The 
German did also. They adapted themselves
. They had newspapers. They had sports 
activities. They had Jewish schools. They had uh rabbinical semi naries. They had - I used to 

go to their lectures. They had musicians. Th
ey had theaters. They had cafes. Uh, some  
people suffered, but others adapted themselves
. And this is one thing I will always say 
about...I can't  speak for other people but I am
 talking about our people. We could adapt 
ourselves. They find a way, and uh life went on. 
 
Q: Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 
A: I'm glad I was able to share some of my experiences. 
 
Q: Thank you. You've been very helpful.
