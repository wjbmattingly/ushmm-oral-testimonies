What you are about to hear

help with his  intr oduc tion.
 
 
We begin with this photograph of Fr ank Lieberm ann. He was  born in Gliwic e, Germ any, now 
in Poland, in 1929.
 
Fr ank  was  about 4 years  old when this  photogr aph was  taken.
 
 
Fr ank was  the only c hild of Hans and Lotte Lieberm an. On the left we s ee Hans  Lieber mann 
and on the r ight we s ee Lotte and her  fir st granddaughter, J oannie.
 
 
Both 
of Frank's par ents' fam ilies  had lived in that part of Ger many, again, now Poland, for 
s ever al gener ations . Fr ank  is  pic tur ed here with his  paternal gr andpar ents, Ber nard and J enny 

Lieberm ann.
 
 
Hitler  c am e to power  in 1933.When Frank began s c hool in 1935,
 
J ewis h s tudents  wer e 
s epar ated fr om the non

J ewis h s tudents  and fear of 
anti

S em itic
 
attacks  bec ame fr equent. P ic tur ed 
her e is  Fr ank 's  first gr ade c las s  on the firs t day of s c hool. The c ones  they are holding c ontain s weets  to 
m ake s c hool s weet. Frank  is  i
n the s ec ond r ow, the four th fr om the right.
 
 
In 1936, Fr ank's father was  no longer able to practic e medic ine as  a r es ult of anti
-
J ewish laws. 
In 1938, the fam ily tried to obtain vis as  to c ome to the United States. Hans tr aveled first and Frank  and 

2 
 
is  
m other followed a few m onths later  in October of 1938. Here we s ee Frank 's  mother's  ticket for  the 
s hip they took  to the United States .
 
 
The Lieberm ann fam ily s ettled in Ohio and Fr ank  went on to graduate fr om Wester n Res er ve, 
now Cas e Wes ter n Res er ve Univers ity, in 1950 with a degr ee in c hem is try.
 
         
 
Fr ank gr aduated fr om c ollege in 1950 and started a long and s uc c es sful car eer in the textile 
indus tr y in New Yor k  City. In that s am e year he married Marianne, his  wife of nearly 66 years
. 
Fr ank  
worked in textile m anufac tur ing until 1992 when he and Marianne m oved to the Was hington, DC area 
to be c los er to their c hildr en
. 
Fr ank  las ted thr ee m onths in r etir ement before going into the travel 
bus ines s  whic h he c ontinues  today, s pec ializing in Europe and U.S.
 
tr avel, including Alas k a. He 
r ec ently joined a new agenc y, Signatur e Tr avel in Mar y land.
 
And he went to wor k  this  mor ning before 
he c am e here.
 
          
 
Fr ank and Marianne hav e thr ee c hildren, two daughters and a s on. Their daughter s, Nanc y 
and J oan, live in this  ar ea and their  s on J er ry is  in Seattle
. 
They have five gr andc hildren with the 
younges t about to turn 25
. 
As Frank  notes
, 
three of them are gainfully employed, one will gr aduate fr om 
Har vard Law Sc hool next J une
,  
and the other, after being a teac hing as s istant at Maas tric ht Univers ity 
in the Nether lands , is  now wor king on his  Ph.D. in Modern Eur opean His tory at the Univers ity of Suffolk 

in Brighton, England.
 
          
 
Fr ank's daughters J oannie and Nanc y ar e her e today with him along with other fam
ily 
m em bers  and fr iends .
 
          
 
Fr ank volunteer s with the Mus eum's  Vis itor Ser vic es  where you will find him  here Thursday 
m or nings
. 
As part of his res pons ibilities
,  
he s peak s  with var ious  gr oups  vis iting the mus eum. He also 
has  s poken to wounded veter a

With that, I'd like you to join me in welc oming our
 
Firs t Pers on
, Mr .
 
Fr ank Lieberm ann.

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr ank , thank  you s o m uc h for  joining us today and for  being willing to be our
 
First 
Pers
on
. We have a s hor t hour with s o muc h to s har e s o we'll s tart r ight away.
 
 
You told me, Fr ank , that your  earlies t m emor ies  start in 1934 when you wer e 5 year s  old. You 
s aid als o of that tim e that all in all it was  a good tim e for your  parents. Tell us  why that was  s o and what 
you c an about your fam ily and their  life in Gliwic e and what you know about yours elf in that tim e in 
thos e first five years . 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man: We lived in Gliwic e, whic h was  appr oxim ately half way between m y 
grandpar ents . My m other's family lived a little bit further wes t and my father's fam ily a little fur ther  eas t. 
And m y par ents  s ettled in the m iddle. My father  was  a ear, nos e, thr oat surgeon.
 
 
Bas ic ally in childhood, I felt ver y fortunate. I think in 1933, my parents  got a c ar w
hic h was 
very unus ual s inc e we liv ed in the middle of town, whic h was  c om mon. On a s treetc ar  line
, my father 

went to the hos pital
,  
on the s tr eet c ar, made house c alls  in the s am e way with public  tr ans portation. He 
had an offic e on the 
m
ain 
s
tr eet, equivalent of s om ething like Connectic ut Avenue. The first thr ee 
r ooms in the fr ont wer e his  offic e, waiting room, and living room, and in the back was  the dining r oom 

and thr ee bedr ooms , an apar tment, s o that he had a half
-
m inute walk to the offic e.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr ank , your  family had lived in the ar ea for a very long time. I think  your  m other's  fam ily 
went bac k  c enturies . Is  that right? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man:  Yes . My mother's  fam ily c elebrated the 100th annivers ary of the family busines s , 

which 
was  a wholes ale leather and tannery bus ines s , in 1933. When Hitler  c ame along, 
bas ic ally
 
--
 
when my father los t his  hos pital pr ivileges, m y gr andfather tried to per s uade him to move to 
a larger c ity. He c ould take c are of them
. A
fter  all, they sur vived WorldWar I with s tar vation
; 
they've 
been in the c om m unity
;  
this  would blow over . My father tur ned that down bec aus e he was  independent 
and he didn't want
 
--
 
he wanted to m ake his own way and s tarted looking for  ways  of getting out of 
Germ any.

> > Bill Bens on:
  
I'm going to keep us  in that tim e for a moment m or e. You started sc hool in 1935, 
s tarted attending a public  s c hool. You s aid to me that the m ost dangerous time for you was  r ec ess . Can 
y
ou s ay a little bit about that? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man: We had to leave
 
the building dur ing r ec es s.We had three rooms  in a large public  
s c hool. At r ec es s we had to go into a large playground area.We tried to be very c los e to our teac her s . 
Boys  and girls wer e s epar ate. And the line in between, ther e was  a lot of hec kling. It
 
was  definitely the 
m os t unc omfor table part of the day.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In 1936, c irc ums tances  for your  parents turned more om inous  and they bec am e m or e 

diffic ult if not danger ous . What c hanged in 1936
? 
What did that m ean for your  family and for you
? 
 
>>
 
Fr ank  Lieberm an:  After  Wor ldWar I ther e was  the Cr imean War whic h involved the Rafians
 
[ph]
 
and led, at the end of it, led to the form ation of Poland. Poland bas ic ally only bec am e
 
--
 
again bec ame 
a c ountr y, after the tr eaty of 1921 whic h inc luded the Gdansk  c or ridor. It inc luded a tr eaty whic h 
pr otected minor ities, both Ger man and Polis h, in former German territories , for 15 year s, whic h ended 
in 1936.
 
 
The Nazis  didn't really take full c ontr ol until that treaty expir ed, in order to protect their  
populat
ion on the Polis h s ide. But onc e the tr eaty was  over, s tores  started being boyc otted. They had 
br own s hirts , blockading m y father 's  office. He lost his  hos pital pr ivileges . And you had an anti
-
S em itic  
m agazine, news paper , at every s tr eet c orner , behind glas s. Things r eally turned bad alm ost 

imm ediately the day after  the tr eaty.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In that same year , in 1936, I believe
 
your  mother  m ade a tr ip to Is rael for  a s pec ific 
pur pos e. What did s he go there for? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man: Well, as  I s aid, my father did not want to ac c ept m y grandfather's  offer  s o they 

s tarted investigating wher e to go. It tur ned out that Is rael was  not a pos s ibility. She went with her  

br other. There was  one doc tor for every 100 people. It was  impos s ible for a J ew to pr actic e m
edic ine. 
Doc tors bec am e c hicken farm ers . That was  not one of the c hoic es . This  is why m y gr andfather 

found
 
--
 
bec am e a genealogis t and started looking up fam ily his tories  to see if ther e ar e any other 
plac es  whic h might offer  refuge.
 
 
It tur ned out that he
 
found a br other
-
in
-
law on m y mother 's s ide had m oved to the United 
States in 1905. After an unfortunate inc ident that he s aid he needed 5,000 m arks, whic h was  in the s ix 
figures  in dollars . For one week he had a problem. He got it and went to the United States. Never  to be 
s een again.
 
He did find that. My gr andfather s aid tr y it, maybe ther e will be s ome retr ibution.
 
He did take a tr ip in 1938.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we c ome to that, 1938, a c ouple of other ques tions . Your  par ents ins is ted
 
--
 
it 
was  ur gent you lear n to s wim. Tell us about that.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man:  Yes . Again, they s aid we would pr obably have to take an oc ean voyage. The 

s wim ming pool would be c los ed after the end of the treaty. My grandfather went with m e, I think about a 
week before and s aw to it that I s wam  in deep water and he didn't leave until that was  done. So I 
enjoyed m y ability to s wim  ever s inc e. But it had a rather om inous beginning.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e that you've been able to doc um ent or s ee the dec line in your 
grandp
ar ents ' bus ines s, I think between 1933 and 1936 or  s o and it was  dramatic, was n't it
? 
Y ou 
m easure
d 
the dollar los s.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man: Well, dollar  los s
 
--
 
nothing has  the s ame value but
 
--
 
now I have to add. They had 
a non
-
J ewis h acc ountant
 w
ho kept the
 
book s . They did loc ate him afterwards . The acc ounting figures , I 
gave them to the Holoc aus t 
M
us eum bec aus e it shows  the rapid dec line from about
 
$100,000
 
--
 
I forget 
what the am ount is , in 1933, to about 20 in 1938 when the bus ines s  was  confis c ated on Kris tallnacht, 
whic h was  the Night of Br oken Glas s .
 
> > Bill Bens on: When your father lost his  admitting privileges  and his pr ac tice was  boyc otted, how was  

he able to m ak e ends meet for the family befor e he left for  the U.S.? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man:  First of all, we lived ver y fr ugally. Money was n't wor th anything bec aus e bank 

ac c ounts wer e fr ozen for anything but as s igned living expens es . So we bas ic ally wor ked from whatever 

s avings  there wer e, with s om e help fr om m y grandparents.
 

4 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you were beginning to tell us , your gr andfather  had loc ated a relative who had 
c om e to the United States in 1905 and that led to your father  m aking a tr ip to the U.S. in J anuary of 
1938 and then moving to the United States later that year . Tell us  what happened ther e.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber man:  He had two s tops . One was  in Philadelphia, in the City Hall, where the 

family
 
--
 
one of the family mar r ied and c am e to the United
 
States and s ettled in Philadelphia in the ear ly 
1700s , bec ame quite pr ominent
, o
ne of the financiers  of the r evolution, s tarted a c ollege in 
Philadelphia. He was  hoping to find s om e trac e of the fam ily whic h c ould help. It tur ned out that 

Rebec c a [Indis c ernible] never m arr ied and her brother moved out wes t. Out wes t was  Louis ville, 
Kentucky.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Fr ank  Lieber man:  He m arr ied but the family los t track  and that was  an area that was  not
 
--
 
there he 
was n't s uc c es sful.
 
 
The s on of the per son who abs c onded the m oney was  vic e pr es ident of an organization, gave 
him  an affidavit whic h was  nec es s ar y to guarantee that we would not be on welfare for a year. 
R
em ember , this was  1938, in the mids t of the s econd phas e of the gr eat depr es s ion.
 
At that time, 
inc
luded in the affidavit, he had an inc om e of
 
$38,000, whic h was  about as  obs c ene as  some of the big 
figures  nowadays . And that did per mit us to get on the quota for  the United States  where we got a 
num ber r ight after his  r etur n in 1938
, i
n J anuary. Then not
hing happened. Star te
d c hecking. It was  
Februar y, Mar c h, April. He c alled a fr iend and s aid, 
ﬁW
hat do I do
? 
I really  need to m ove
.:
 
And he said, 
well, the c ounc il had a sec retary, Fraulein Sc hm idt. 
ﬁ
I've heard if you get her  a nic e box of c andy, that 
m ight
 
help.
ﬂ 
And I want to m ention that in bad times , c orr uption is  r ampant. Bec aus e people are 
des perate.
 
Again, for  about another month nothing happened.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And he s ent the c hoc olates.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  He took  the c hoc olates .
 
> > Bill B ens on
:  Ok .
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  And he c alled his  friend again and s aid, ﬁL
ook , I'm getting really anxious .
ﬂ  
He 
s aid, 
ﬁW
ell, did you put 100 m arks into the box of c andy?
ﬂ  
> > Bill Bens on: He did take another box of c andy.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  He did.
 
> > [Lau
ghter] 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  And in J une, we were c alled to Berlin to have a phys ic al at the Americ an 
Em bas s y.We got our  vis a pr om ptly. And the vis a is  good for  120 days . You could only take out 10 
m arks, whic h is  about
 
$2.50. By today's  standar ds  that's
 
pr obably about
 
$50. But there was  an angle 
that if you took a German boat and went fir s t c lass , you got a pretty good, what do
 
you
 
c all it, s pending 
allowanc e for the gift s hops but if you didn't s pend it, you could turn it into Am er ican dollars.
 
 
My fath
er took  the next boat and went s tr aight to Ohio whic h the bar passed half of the 
people. He had a fr iend who was  a gynec ologist in Cleveland, was  a fraternity brother, who mentioned 

the 50%. My father was  a gam bler
 a
nd got a room  for
 
$5 a week, s pent the t
ime at the medic al libr ar y 
to hone up, r egister ed for  the Dec em ber s tate boards . And s inc e the vis a was  good for 120 days , we 
booked at the end of 120 days , on the 12th of Oc tober.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr ank , why didn't you go when your  father went
? 
Bec aus e he
 
left in J une.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  To s ave m oney.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  In other  wor ds , he was n't able to ear n a living. My m other c los ed the hous ehold. 
You c ould pay 100% tax on anything that you took  out s o that we were able to pac
k  fur nitur e. My 
m other  got a s ewing mac hine in c as e s he needed
 
--
 
s he was  good at s ewing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But s he had to pay 100% tax.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  100% tax to the governm ent on what anything was  worth. But with that we got a 
lift, whic h is  
s om ething like a c ontainer, whic h c ould be packed with s om ebody s upervis ing that 
ever ything was  being taken out.We bas ic ally gave up our  apartm ent. We s tayed in a furnis hed r oom  

dur ing that tim e
; a
gain, to s ave anything pos s ible and get r eady for a fam ily
 
r eunion in October.

> > Bill Bens on:  And during that tim e, in the summ er of 1938, while you're waiting for your departure, 
s om ewhere along the line you had an ac c ident and br oke your  arm. Tell us  about that.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Kids  play tag.
 
> > [Laught
er] 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  My mother c alled the loc al orthopedist whom  they had gone to medic al dinner s  

with, etc ., that s aid, 
ﬁS
orry, I don't tak e c ar e of J ewis h patients.
ﬂ 
So s he got fr antic ally on to the phone 
and found an orthopedist in my gr andfather's  town, Boynton. He s aid, look, take a taxi, go to the 
bac kdoor  of the Catholic  orphanage. She gave the addres s. 
:
Go into the freight entr anc e, I'll meet you 
at the orphanage.
ﬂ 
He took  a quick  minute. He s et my arm , put on a c ast, and gave ins tr uctions  to 
m y 
pediatric  doctor on what to do after the c ast c omes  off. And bas ic ally s he did that.
 
My left arm now 
bends  a little bit further than m y r ight arm s are, so s he did a very good job. [Laughter ]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But that's  what it took  for you to get your b
r oken arm stain c ar e of.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So with your  mother  dealing with things  like that, trying to c los e up the hous ehold, 

tr ying as  hum anly pos s ible to s ave m oney to prepare to leave, that had to be just an inc r edibly s tr es
sful 
tim e for her during thos e four m onths  with your father  gone.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  It was . But, look, under the c irc um s tanc es , you do what has  to be done and the 
r es ults were positive. I was  bles s ed with ver y s tr ong par ents .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e le
aving for Br em e
rhaven
, I believe, in 1938.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I have to interr upt. You have all hear d of the Munich c onferenc e
? 
This  

was
 
--
 
Hitler gave s om e dem ands  on Fr anc e and England. Ther e was  a c onfer enc e between 
P
rime 
M
in
is ter  Cham berlain, the Frenc h, Prim e Minis ter Daladier  and Munic h during whic h Hitler dem anded 
the German
-
s peaking part of land wher e the giant m ountains  on the German bor der  and Cham ber lain 
and Daladier  gave into Hitler and bas ic ally gave away par t of Czec hos lovakia without their
 
c ons ent. 
Whic h was  unbelievable at the time. Although we didn't know anything about this . Cens ors hip was  

c om plete. Ther e was  no internet. T
her e was  c omplete c ens ors hip of the pr es s . You weren't allowed to 
lis ten to foreign br oadc as ts .
 
 
By the way, during that time, Hitler  c alled back all s hips  at s ea with the threat of war .
 
 
We took the tr ain.We s aid goodbye to m y grandparents.We went to Berlin to have our  
pas s port stamped with the day to m ake s ur e that we don't com e back . It was  ins tigated by the Swiss  

who wanted to make s ure that they ar e not getting any J ewis h refugees . It bec am e nec es s ar y to do that 
to em igr ate.
 
 
We went on to Brem en. When we got to Brem en, ther e was  no s hip. Bec aus e the Eur opa, 
whic h was  wher e we were booked, had been c alled back and
 
was  delayed for four days . Th
is  treaty 
happened in Septem ber, the beginning of September
. 
 
 A
nd the trip took  s ix days . The normal routine was  that the s hip s tayed overnight, got c leaned, 
and took  pas s engers  the next day. So it always  left on the s am e day
.  
It made up three of the four  days  
and finally it left with us a day late in order to get bac k  to its regular s c hedule. Therefore, we knew 
nothing about this until we got to the s hip and didn't find out about Munic h until we were onboar d and 
s poke to s om e
 
Americ ans .
 
 
Can't imagine total c ensor s hip but they had c omplete c ontr ol of ever ything.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you're finally
 
--
 
the s hip finally  leaves and you m ake it to the United States. Tell us  
about arr iving here, r euniting with your  father, and then what happened.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  My father  picked us up. We stayed two days  in New Yor k. I got a s ights eeing 
tour on the upper  deck , the open deck , on a 5th Avenue bus whic h went all the way up 5th Avenue into 

Washington Heights  and back. I got introdu
c ed to Coke.

> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I thought it was  c oc oa. And I r eally didn't want it. [Laughter]
 
 
And then we took the Em pir e State Expr es s  and went to Cleveland where my father had 
r ented a one

bedr oom  apar tm ent. I had the privilege of s leeping on a m erc y bed
, w
hic h is  a bed whic h 
folds  into a c los et in the liv ing r oom.We started a new life.

a bic yc le.

delic ates s en on
 
the bottom  of the apar tment house whic h had a 25

cent s pec ial of a cor ned beef

dinner.
 
 
I started elem entar y s c hool. At that tim e we didn't have

this  was  when I was here for thr ee weeks, a little bit 
les s . My parents  dec ided they wanted to go to a m ovie. I think it was  aWednes day night s pec ial of 10 

c ents  for a movie. Th
ey as ked a neighbor to look in on m e. I didn't want a babys itter but s he peeked in 
about ever y 15 m inutes.

phone c alls  were

per s on. This  was  probably the longes t hour of m y life bec aus e I knew s om ething was  wrong 
and I didn't know what it was . 
 
 
When m y par ents  c ame hom e, pr obably about 10:00, it was  m y grandparents  that the 
bus ines s  had been c onfis c ated, that m y m other's two twin br others had been jailed, and that this was  

Kr is tallnac ht. The s ynagogue at the tim e had been bur ned and they wer e des per ate what c an be done.
 
My father took  the next bus  to New Yor k  to tr y to s ee Char lie, a pers on who gave the affidavit, who
 
s aid 
he c an't take any
 
m or e res pons ibility even though we never took a penny from him. But apparently that 
was  too c los e to the per son whom  his  father had s tolen from .
 
 
We wer e in no pos ition to m ake a guar antee and they tried des per ately from that tim e o
n to tr y 
to find s ome ways  of getting out. Mainly for the c hildren. My grandfather , who had s inc e been 
widowed
 
--
 
m y gr andmother died of natural c aus es
 
--
 
was  at an old age res idenc e, as s isted living. And 
the other gr andpar ents als o, they jus t wanted to save their  c hildr en.
 
 
We finally did manage to get pas s age to Shanghai. Ther e wer e two c ountr ies  whic h willingly 
took r efugees. One was  the J apanes e
-
oc c upied Shanghai and the Dom inican Republic , in the 
Car ibbean. Other wis e the world was pretty m uc h c los ed.
 
 
They got tickets for  Shanghai to leave J une
 
1940. In the m eantim e World War II had s tarted. 
This  was  jus t after the invas ion, the br eakthrough of the marginal line in Franc e. Their ticket was  on an 

Italian boat. After the Ger mans brok e through and got to Par is , the Italians  dec lared war  on
 
England 
and Fr anc e. The Suez Canal was  c los ed and the boat went back . That was  the las t word we got fr om  
m y mother's  br others , one of the wives , and 3

> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  He had a ticket to get out through Spain but being sic k he was  transfer red to 

Theres iens ta
dt wher e he died in 1940.We got this  eventually through m y grandparents  who did write

oc c as ionally, ver y heavily c ens ored, letter s, for ins tanc e. I remember one letter  whic h was  on file, 
from 
Theres iens tadt, through the Red Cross , s aying that we're doing fine, we'v e gained s ome weight. My 
grandfather now weighs  130
 
pounds . He us ed to weigh 180. So ever ything that c ould be s aid was  
c oded.
 
 
We finally found afterWor ld War II th
r ough from a rabbi who mar ried my
 
grandpar ents , Leo 
Bec k . The Nazis  s om ehow kept him  alive in Ther es iens tadt, probably to keep a c ertain am ount of 
or der. My mother m et him in Cinc innati at the Hebr ew U
nion 
C
ollege, I think  in 1946
, 
and he c onfirmed 
that m y grandparents  were deported in 1943. And we got further indic ations  that all the brothers  died in 

Aus c hwitz.
 
 
I'd like to say, I'm her e as  a witnes s . I am not a sur vivor . I had all the pr ivileges of gr owing up 
her e but I need to pas s on what c an happen to humanity.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the time we have r em aining, ther e's s ever al m ore things I'd like you to s hare with us. 
 
Your  father was

onc e he was  able to get his lic ens e, you m oved to Dayton and he wanted to s tart a 
m edic al pr actic e. Tell us  what happened to him in Dayton, initially.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Fir s t of all, his  fr ater nity brother, the gynec ologist who per s uaded him to c ome 

to Ohio, had s hared an offic e with an ear, nos e, throat phys ic ian. And he said it would r eally be a good 
idea for you to s ettle in Dayton, not in Cleveland. In or der  to s ave embarras s m ent and the fact t
hat 
Dayton was  growing, it was  pr obably a very good c hoic e.
 
He opened his  prac tic e. We m oved to 
Dayton. 
 
 
In the beginning of Febr uar y
, h
e opened his  prac tic e on Valentine's  Day
, a
nd imm ediately 
as ked for  adm ittanc e to the medic al s ociety, whic h at that tim e was  kind of a lic ens e to legitim ac y, was  

expec ted for hos pital privileges , etc. Shor tly after he put in his  applic ation, the medic al s oc iety in 
Dayton had an emergenc y meeting on a Fr iday night, whic h, by the way, is  the firs t day of Shabbat, the 

evenin
g of Shabbat. It was  dec ided to r equir e c itizens hip in or der to qualify for member s hip in the 
m edic al s oc iety. And that was  to take effec t imm ediately.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They voted on it that Fr iday night.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Yes. Apparently there was  s ome people who were quite ups et with this .
 
 
By the way, the vote was  52
-
50. The next m or ning, a s taff member of "The Dayton 
H
er ald," 
c alle
d m y father 's  offic e and s aid, ﬁ D

?ﬂ 
He s aid

Where did you take your  res idenc y

Give me your  back gr ound.

He s aid
, ﬁT

The next m or ning, the Sunday paper of "The Dayton Herald" had an editorial "Freedom of 
Opportunity in the United States ." This  was

excuse m e for  m aking m e c ry. The next Monday he had 
11 new patients . And we got establis hed. And the r est of my life is  pretty muc h

Pleas e tell us  about the bic yc le.

Mr .
 
Hor owitz. He s aid, We can put the bic yc le into a box whic h takes  les s room for packing; I think  it will 
m ake it m uc h eas ier . I s aid thank you ver y m uc h. And when we got to Dayton, we unpa
cked the lift. We 

lived in a two

bedr oom  apar tm ent.We unpacked s ome of the fur niture and the bic yc le. And s hortly after  
that we got a letter  saying, 
p
leas e be ver y c areful when you unpac k  the bic yc le. In the fr am e
 
--
 
please 
take the bic yc le apart. Take the s eat off and go down in the frame.We had s ome gold piec es. Pleas e 

keep thos e for us . They ar e quite valuable.
 
 
And I have to give you back ground. Having gold c oins  was  prohibited with a c apital offens e. 
My father was  fur ious  that they would endanger  m e 
and my mother  for the s ake of a few hundred 
dollar s . We got thos e gold piec es . My father had five of them  m ade, one for my mother, one for each of 

m y kids. I think ther e was  one extra. And they bec ame little necklac es. Rather than s elling them, I think 

the

finally wanted a r efr iger ator . He s ent them a refr igerator and never wanted to hear from  them

This  is  why I volunteer her e.

that
? 
Ta

> > Bill Bens on:  Before we c los e the pr ogr am. We have a little more to go. Let's s ee if we have any 

questions  from  our audienc e.
 
 
We have micr ophones  com ing down the ais le. Try to m ak e your  ques tion as  br ief as you c an. 
I'll r epeat it to make sur e everybody hears  it and then Frank  will respond to it.
 
>> Mr .
 
Lieberm ann
, 
thank  you for s haring your  stor y. I'm c urious  how your  par ents  s pok e to you about 
what was  going on in Ger many and the world during
 
the tim e you were gr ow up there and then 
ultim ately why you wer e c om ing to the states .
 
> > Bill B ens o
n:  How did your par ents  s peak to about what was  going on and the dec is ion to c om e to 
the United States
? 
What did they s ay to you? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  A
 
very good ques tion, by the way. [Laughter]
 
 
I knew what was  going on.We hear d the news . We didn't want to believe what was  happening 
like m os t people didn't want to believe what was  happening. I don't k now how
 
--
 
nobody really c ould 
fathom how c orr upt the wor ld bec am e during this time. It jus t
 
--
 
it was n't feas ible.
 
 
In other words , c ivilization was  at risk. I c an never r emember any time like this  whether  it was  
fr om  the J apanes e s ide, the German s ide. I don't know how to des cribe it. Unles s  you live thro
ugh that, 
it's  an er a that I c ertainly would never , ever  want to happen in any kind of way. And it's s c ar y to think  
that s o m any people are ac ting in an unc ivilized m anner.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.
 
 
We have another  ques tion.We have a young m an right here, almos t in the m iddle r ight ther e. 
Let the mic r ophone c ome down to you. There you go.
 
> > Did you hear  any of Hitler's  s peeches or hear anything on the radio? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you hear  any of Hitler 's  s peeches  or anything on the radio? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lie
ber mann:  You c ouldn't help hearing it. That's all you got. The enthus ias m is  ver y difficult 
to even think  about bec aus e a dictator  c an only be effec tive if he has s upport. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.
 
 
We'll do one m or e ques tion and then we're going to c l
os e up. Ok .
 
>> Mr .
 
Lieberm ann, how were you tr eated as  a c hild her e, as  a Germ an imm igr ant
? 
I had fr iends that I 
taught with, Fr ank  Mio
mo
to, J apanes e, he was  s ent to a c onc entr ation c am p here in the United States . 
How wer e you tr eated? 
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Ho
w were you tr eated when you c am e to the United States  as  a c hild, an immigrant 
fr om  Germany?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I was  treated ver y well. I never r ealized I had an acc ent.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  In other  wor ds , I bec am e Americ anized and I bec am e an Amer ic an and a patr iot 
fr om  the day I stepped foot in New York. I lived the Americ an dream. And I have my fam ily to pr ove it. I 

have two daughter s  her e, a s on in Seattle, five grandc hildr en with whom  I've traveled throughout the 
world and I wis h the same for everybody.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We had a c ouple of other hands  up. 
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
that our Fir st Per son gets the las t wor d. I'm going to turn back 
to Frank in a m om ent to c los e the program.When he finis hes, we invite anybody that wants  to c om e up 

9 
 
on the s tage afterwards , as k  another ques tion of Fr ank, jus t s ay hi, get your pic tur e taken with him. So 
pleas e know that you ar e ver y welc om e to do that when we finis h the program .
 
 
I want to thank all of you. We'll have four m ore program s, two m or e weeks, this  week befor e 
we c los e up for 2016. Our  webs ite will have inform ation about our 2017 progr am . So pleas e c om e back 
next year, even this year  if you c an do s o.We'd love to have you.
 
 
Fr ank, I'm going to tur n to you for your  las t wor d but I'm  going to interject one other  note that 
we didn't get to talk  about. You des cribed to us your father on Kris tallnac ht, after getting the phone call 

fr om  your  grandparents, going to tr y to s ee what h
e c ould do with the other  fam ily r elative that was  her e 
in the United States . Your  father went on to help bring out of Eur ope a lot of people and he was  
r ec ognized for that later. Wasn't he? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  My father  gave out I think  107 affidavits  for var ious refugees  after Wor ld War  II.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that meant he took  pers onal r es pons ibility for  them.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Cor rect. He was  als o head of the J ewis h fam ily s ervic e in Dayton, as  a 
volunteer, not pr ofes s ionally. In fact, he was  the rec ipient together with five people inc luding Pr es ident 
Trum an of the 75th 
A
nnivers ary HIAS 
A
ward for the s ettlement effor ts. In other words , he did for  others  
what he c ouldn't do for his  own fam ily.
 
 
It's  im portant to lift ever y body that we c an. This  is one of 
the 
is s ues now. And I feel strongly 
about it. The better everybody lives , the better and s afer we all are.
