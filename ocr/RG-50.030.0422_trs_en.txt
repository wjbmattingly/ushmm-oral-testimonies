NICHOLAS WINTON 
 November 17, 1995 
 
Q: So, I'm Arwen Donahue and we'r e here at 
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and it's 
Nove mber 17, 1995.  I'm here with Mr. Nic
holas Wi nton.  And Mr. Wi nton if you would 
state for me  your date of 
birth and place of birth? 
 
A: I was born on the 19th of May 1909 in London. 

 

Q: And will you say some thing for me  about 
your family background, what your father did, 
and your mo ther, and what you reme mber? 
 

A: My father was a banker, Mother was bor
n in Nuremberg and was the first girl in 
Germany to take the Ivy tour which is the 
matriculation when that exam became open for 
girls.  And she came to London after her ma rriage when she was very young.  She was 

still 17. 
 

Q: What was the atmosphere in your home  like in your early years? 

 

A: It was very... it was ma rvelous.  We  were 
in a home  which Father's  parents had owned 
previously.  It was an enormous 20 r oom hous
e with a billiard tabl
e in I reme mber, and 
yes we were happy there.  It was in the north of London in Hampstead and Father moved 

from banking after the war to importing glass 
from Czechoslovakia.  He joined a firm 

which imported glass.  Yes, it was very as fa
r as I can reme mber, a congenial atmosphere.  
Nearly 85 years ago now, so I don't know 
how much one genuinely remembers from 
one's childhood. 
 

Q: Now, you traveled to Germany 
when you were fairly young, did you not? 
 

A: Well, we traveled to Germany on hol iday 
because  Mother's relatives were still in 
Nuremberg.  Mother's mother was st ill in Nu
remb erg and brothers a
nd sisters were still 
over there.  And of course when Hitler arrive
d on the scene, so the family that had been 
still in Germany started to co
me  over to England and of cour
se Mother and Father were 
able to help them not only to come  over but 
to...to look after them.  They all stayed with 
us to start with before ma king their separate ways in the world. 
 

Q: How would you describe.... were you aware of 
Hitler from the  beginning of his rise to 
power, and did you know anything about him?  
 

A: I think we did, because when Hitler came 
to power in 1933 I was 24 and I... from my 
youth I think I've always been 
very politically conscious and 
always very left wing and I 
joined all kinds of things which would have been protesting agai
nst things like Hitler 
represented.  Yes, I think we were very awar
e of it from early on, especially having gone 
through the first world war also where you 
had that... not anti-semitic feeling, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
2 
 
 
certainly anti-Germa n fe eling in the countr
y.  Later on, one ha d not only the anti-semitic 
but the anti-Germa n feeling together. 
 

Q: When you were... before you become  a L
ondon stock broker, correct me  if I'm wrong, 
you had traveled to Germany to study banking? 
 

A: Yes.  We ll, Father, as I said, had been a ba
nker, and he thought that my c a reer should be 
in banking, and that a little tr
avel would do me  good, and I was in a bank in France for a 
year and then six months with a bank in 
Hamburg and then six months for the bank in 
Berlin, and I would have gone on 
to do banking over here in the 
States we re it not for the 
big crash occurring in '29, and so Father though
t it was about time  I ca me  home , instead 
of hi m spending money on me
, and some of my own. 
 

Q: Were you interested in banking? 

 

A: Yes, I think I was interested in banking 
and finance, yes.  I dare say I would have 
accomodated myself to any other profession I'
d be put in, but banking seemed to suit me 
quite well, yes. 
 

Q: What are your recollections from those 
months that you spent in Germany, political 
recollections?   Did you 
witness persecution? 
 

A: When I was in Germany which would have 
been in 1930, I have no pol
itical recollections 
at all really.  I mean I did banking, I ma de 
a lot of friends.  I was good at fencing and I 
was both in Ha mburg and in Berlin in the lo
cal fencing club, and me t a lot of friends 
there-- and in fact I even fenced for Ge
rmany.  At that time in 1930, there was a big 
match against Denmark, actually.  I was on 
their team and I also owned a boat on the 
Wansee and spent the weekends boating.  So at 
that time  there was no -- I me an I wasn't  
interested in politics as such at that time a
nd it was of course prior 
to... it was three years 
before Hitler even came on the scenes.  So, no I wasn't  in any way politically interest ed at 

that period. 
 

Q: When woul d you say that your po
litical awareness was focused? 
 

A: Well, I mean in England I was always po
litically aware of politi
cs, but local politics, 
British politics.  And it was really only slow
ly, after 1933, when the implications of what 
was happening in Germa ny were known, that I became kind of interested in that. 

Because, as I say, I was always 
very interested in politics, and my friends were always 

very interested in politics, a
nd we were all pretty well left
-wing and we used to have 
meetings and discuss things so that really di re
ctly Hitler became a factor in European life.  
Yes, we were very interested in that, ver
y.  We  be came more s o as he became  more 
aggressive and took over more of Europe. 
 

Q: Can you describe your friendship with Martin Blake? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422

A: Well, Martin Blake had always been a frie
nd of mi ne.  He was a master at West mi nster 
School in London, and he and I shared lots of inte
rests, but chiefly polit
ical interests.  We  
also liked winter sports, and 
he took a party of children to 
winter sports every year in 
Switzerland, and I accompanied him which had the advantage of, for very little trouble or 
expense of energy, we got a free holiday.  And, 
we were very close.  We  were always 
together and nearly always with other peopl
e who were discussing 
politics in some  way 
or other reasonably left wing politics because
 there was a lot going on at that time as 

Hitler became more and more infl uential in Europe. 
 

Q: Do you remember any of your discussions? 

 

A: Well, not in detail really no.  They we
re anti- Hitler, though.  I can't reme mber the 
details.  The politics in Engl
and at that time  were so complicated.  You had the people 
who were very frightened about the rise in 
Hitler, and yet one of 
the biggest left-wing 
move me nts was the Peace Pledge Union which 
in a way was contrary to what was going 
on in Europe.  So, it was a very curious peri
od, which was highlighted later on, of course, 
by the way Chamberlain and other people dealt w
ith the rise of Hitler.  They were also 
very schizophrenic about it.  They didn't rea
lly know how... how to ha
ndle it.  They still 
thought that... that this idea of peace could be
 ma intained and... Very difficult to discuss 
the feeling in England at that 
time, because there were of course a lot of people like there 
were in every country, because of the rise, just
 because of the rise of left wing influence 
who were becomi ng mor e  and more right wi
ng.  So, there were crowds of people in 
England who at that time were very right-wing, as epitomized by Oswald Mosely and his 

people, whom I actually knew qu
ite well at that time .  He 
was in our fencing club, Sir 
Oswald Mosely.  He seemed quite inoffens
ive when he was fencing but he commande d 
quite a political clout later on. 
 

Q: Did you have particular ideas after the rise
 of Hitler of what should be done, what you 
wanted to do or that you felt you should do some thing in response? 
 

A: Well, I think in a democracy the indivi
dual always feels rath
er powerless, you know.  
You could feel it and talk about it and disc
uss it but except voting fo
r a government there 
was nothing one could really do about it.  My political  awareness of Hitler really was 

only crystallized when I got to Prague a
nd really saw for mys e lf.  One could see 
individually what was happening from time 
to time but there was little one could do 
about it.  I mean, one is very powerless rea
lly, the individual in a democracy.  And yes, 
we discussed it and we discussed the dangers of 
it, at the same  ti me  as this peace pledge 
move me nt was going on, so it was very curious situ
ation at that time.  But there were lots 
of people in England who weren't that much frightened by Hitler at the time , you know, 

who felt that the danger wasn't  Hitler at all.
  The danger was Russia.  And a great ma ny 
people at that time I don't think ever thought th
at we would really 
be in conflict with 
Germany, because they thought that the politici
ans would be adept enough to see that the 
Germans fought Russia and not us.  
 In the event, of course, they fought 
both, but not in the order we expected. 
 

Q: Now, Martin Blake, at this time, 
was working with refugees, was he not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422

A: No, no, Martin Blake really had nothing to do 
with refugees at all.  Martin Blake knew a 
lot of people politically as well as of cour
se his work for the school and he was very 
friendly with one lady Doreen Wa r i ner who 
was the repr esentative for the British 
Committee for Czechoslovakia and was given the 
job of going out to Prague and heading 
a move me nt  to try and save those who had ar
rived in Czechoslovakia and were politically 
endangered since the Germans... whe n the Germ
ans... if the Germans arrived.  That was 
of course after the... Hitler ma rched in S
udetenland.  And he rung me  up one day just 
before he was setting off for Prague and sa
id, "Look, I've cancelled my trip to winter 

sports so yours is cancelled too.  I'm in a 
rush-- I can't  tell you what's going on but meet 
me  in Prague and I'll tell you," and that's how 
I got to Prague.  I really didn't  know what I 
was in for when I left. 
 

Q: When was that? 

 

A: When was that?   That wa s Christma s '
38, '39. I don't know the actual dates anymore.  
That was Christma s '38, '39.  And I went out
 and me t hi m, Bl ake, one evening, I knocked 
him up at the hotel Sr oubek and he told me  what  was happening. 
 

Q: What did he tell you? 

 

A: Well he told me  that there was all these people who had come  into Czechoslovakia 
mostly after the Germans ma rched into Sudete
nland, and that they were the Jews, they 
were the writers, they were those who were 
on Hitler's blacklist, and I think there were 
five separate groups, all of 
whom we re endangered, and the 
job of Doreen Wa riner and 
the British Co mmittee was to try and rescue th
em and get them out to England.  And at 
that time, of course, they were
... a lot of the people were livi
ng with friends or relatives 
whom they knew in Czechoslovakia but a lot of 
them were already in camps.  And I went 
'r ound the camps to see what was going on, togeth
er with actually two ladies who were 
given into my custody to look after whilst 
I did these tours, and one was Eleanor 
Rathbone, the me mber of parliame nt, and th
e other was the Reverend Rosalind Lee, who 

was the head of the Unitarian church.  And 
we toured 'r ound these camps in the dead of 
winter and snow.  It was all rather cold a
nd pathetic to see what
 was going on.  And I 
suppose that's  when my final... when more of
 my ideas about really what was going on in 
the continent were forme d. 
 

Q: Were these camps all located near Pr ague? 

 

A: The ones we saw were located near Pr ague. 
 I remember we went by car but whether we 
hired a taxi or whether we we
re mo ved around I really can't  reme mber but they were, yes, 
in the vicinity of Prague.  They were Ni
ssenhunt (ph) camps, and very over-crowded, and 
very nasty pl aces for continuous living. 
 

Q: Do you remember what you saw there,
 anything in part
icular stand out? 
 

A: What, at the camps? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422

Q: Yes. 

 

A: No, I can't  reme mber except that on my wa
y out to Prague I met a gentleman called Mr. 
Hails who said he was out there to do busine
ss.  He was in the motorbike business...  I 
think he was going to buy motorbikes, and I sa
id that he couldn't really know what as 
going on in Europe if he thought
 he could buy motorbikes at 
this particular time  in 
Czechoslovakia, and he said, "Well what ar
e you doing? "  and I sai
d, "I really don't know 
at the mo me nt, but this will be my address, 
and if you've got time come and visit me."  

And he visited me  the second day I was th
ere and I took him 'r ound the camps.  And in 
talking to him actually I found out that he wa s the Mr. Hails who ins
tigated the Atlantic 
Blue Ribbon for the big boats, so he must have
 been in that kind of business.  And going 
round the camps, he suddenly disappeared, and I 
went back to look for him.  He was on 
one of the beds crying his eyes out.  He was not knowing what he was going to be in for; 

he hadn't really expected that I would 
take him into that kind of situation. 
 

Q: So, would you say that mo
st people weren't aware that these camps existed? 
 

A: I shouldn't think in England that anybody wa
s aware of it all.  I don't really know.  I 
should think a lot of people in Prague must 
have known about it, yes, but whether it was 

known in England I don't know.  I mean, we
 were... obviously everybody knew that the 
Germans ma rched into Sudetenland.  Ever
ybody in England said, you know, "This is 
Hitler's last ambition, and he's not going to do any more."  When I was over there and 

found out that in ma rching into Sudetenland no
t only meant that they were ma rching into 
that part of Czechoslovakia which was ch
iefly inhabited by Germans, but all their 

defenses were in that line too, so from 
that mo ment on Czechoslovakia was pretty 
defenseless in any case.  And of course Pr
ague wa s full of Germans already.  We  were 
followed 'r ound the whole time  by the Germans.
  So one could see what was going on.  I 
wrote home and said, "Look, this is happening,"
 they either didn't want to or didn't 
believe that what we were act
ually seeing there meant what we
 were perfectly certain that 
it meant: that  the Germans were on their way. 
 

Q: Where were you staying? 

 

A: I stayed at the Hotel Sroubek which we stay
ed at when we were over in Pr ague four or 
five years ago, when we were... I got the 
Freedom of Prague and me t Havel and had 
lunch with Dubcek.  It was all 
very exciting.  We stayed at th
e same hotel that I had been 
at in 1939, right in central Prague. 
 

Q: And was Martin Blake stay
ing with you there as well? 
 

A: No, he didn't.  I thi
nk he was already dead -- 
 

Q: No, at the time. In '38. 

 

A: He was in the Sroubek, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422

Q: Now, will you describe  to me  how you becam
e aware that you were going to be working 
on this issue of refugees in Prague
 and how you came to that decision? 
 

A: Well, as I said I went round the camps a
nd I was told of the people whom the British 
Committee were trying to get out.  And ever
y day I me t up with Doreen Warriner to 

discuss what was going on and we usually me t 
at one of the big hot
els, the Alcron, and 
discussed what was going on.  Usually there 
were one or two me n 
sitting not far away, 
and she had to say to me in German, "Until 
that gentleman disappears we better discuss 
the weather."  You could be as rude as you'd 
like to the Germans as English people at that 
time, because we certainly didn't, and I mea
n, they certainly, I don't think, at that time  
ever thought they were going to be at war 
with England.  And we of course hoped they 
wouldn't. And in conversation she said, 
"There are all these children, you know, who 
should be got out, but the British Committee just 
can't  do anything about it at all.  They'r e 
far too overworked with the business of trying to
 get out the political  refugees, the writers 
and all those people endangered,"  and sa
id to me , "Look, if anything can be done, 
perhaps you'd like to try and do it," a
nd that's  really how it started. 
 

Q: Were you aware at that point
 that England had ma de the 
decision to let in a certain 
number of children? 
 

A: No, I hadn't got a clue.  I found a gen
tlema n who came out from England, Trevor 
Chadwick, who said that if it was possible to
 bring children out, he'd
 given up his job as 
teaching in Swannage (ph), he'd run the office in
 Prague.  And I said, "Well, I've not got a 
clue whether you can bring children into Engla
nd, but stay there, and I'll go back to 
England and find out if anything can be done."
  And so, I me a n, when I left Prague 
nobody had any idea that anything would really tran
spire.  In the end it didn't prove very 
difficult.  The Home  Offi ce said, "Under cert
ain conditions," which they laid down, "you 
can bring in as many children as you like."  
So, the Home  Offi ce ma de no difficulties at 
all.  Getting children into other countries wa
s more difficult.  We got a few children into 
Sweden whilst I was still in Prague, but late
r on I don't know i f that move me nt continued.  
But we didn't bring out children to anywhere 
else except into England.  We tried to get 
children into America but that wasn't  possible at that time. 
 

Q: How did you try to do that? 

 

A: Well I have letters with a lot of the important
 people in Ame r ica at th
at time and they all 
gave excuses -- no it's  not fair to say excu
ses -- they gave reasons why they couldn't 
allow children to be brought into America at
 that time , whi c h ma kes pretty sad reading 
when you read these letters at the present day. 
 But still, that was... I me an bringing over 
600 children was some thing I suppose, but ma ny more could have been brought over had 

we... had we had more time as well, of course
.  I don't think a lot of
 people realized the 
urgency which we felt was there.  Having been 
in Prague, one could almost feel that it 
was any time the Germans could ma rch in.  Back in London, of course, that urgency 

wasn't  there at all.

Q: And you we re in Prague for three weeks? 
 

A: I was in Prague about a fortnight.  That wa
s as long as my holiday allowe d, and even then 
I was getting letters: Why did I want  to 
spend time  in Czechoslovakia when I should 
come back and make mo ney for my firm
 on the stock exchange?   There wa s no-- 
certainly not in the city-- there was no real 
feeling of either urgenc
y or things should be 
done, you know.  It was rather the, ge nerally
 the Cha mberlain attitude, you know: putting 
oneself out for a little country far away w
ith which we had no genuine obligations.  The 
major factor of Hitler versus Europe wasn't  really in people's mi nds at that time, despite 

what Hitler had done up to then.  And I think 
there were lots of people who would have 
obviously far preferred to ma neuve
r Hitler to fight against Russia first than for us to take 
up the cudgels.  After all, th
ere had been plenty of time 
for England and France and the 
West to take up against Hitler, but before th
en there was plenty of occasions, as he had 
been nibbling away at various parts of 
Europe, that we could say, "Enough, and no 
further."  I mean, by the time we took a stand 
on the Polish issue most of Europe had 
been already absorbed, or a lot of it anywa
y.  So, I suppose historians will be writing 
about that for a long time: whether or not it 
could have been done differently.  I don't 
think that people, certainly in England, real
ized the danger.  They
 always thought they 
could negotiate with Hitler, that in a way he was a smaller me nace than what was 

happening elsewhere in the world. 
 

Q: What was the date... do you reme mbe r  the fi
rst... How did you get th
e first transport out 
of Czechoslovakia? 
 

A: Well, I was only then, when I came back to England I was working on the stock 
exchange, which luckily was a job which finish
ed at 3:30 in the afternoon so I could go 
back and carry on trying to... to ma ke arrangem
ents for bringing children over.  And as I 
say, the British Committ ee for Refugees from
 Czechoslovakia didn't give me ... weren't 
able to gi ve me either office space or any 
help whatsoever.  And I just ha d note paper 
printed with their name  on it, and put under, "Children's 
Section," worked from my 
private home up in Hampstead.  And the Reve
rend Rosalind Lee whom I mentioned, sent 

me  the first 100 pounds to pay for correspondence and everything and we got newspapers 

like Picture Post to write articles saying that
 we were looking for 
guarantors and that we 
were looking for home s where these children w
ould be looked after until the end of war.  
And this started to trickle i
n, and, as we got people who woul
d take children, so we sent 
them lists of children and ev
en photos of children, and got 
them to choose children, and 
we then sent these out to Trevor Chadwick in
 Prague, who then arra
nged for the transport 
and the getting the children 
together, whilst we arranged for the people who were 
receiving the childrento arrive at Liverpool Stre
et Station to receive them. 
 

Q: Can we go back to Prague  for just alittle while and will you tell me  about how you 
started the operation going, you cam
e to the realization that th
e children needed help and 
then what did you do?

(End of tape 1, side A) 
 
Q: When you were in Prague, the end of 1938 and the beginning of 1939 wha t  did you do 
after you realized that 
the children needed help
 in escaping Europe? 
 

A:  Once I told Doreen Warriner that  if 
it were possible to do it I would try and do it 
and knowing that when I came back to England I would have to go back to work, the 

thing was to arrange the se
t up in Prague which could 
go into operation should I be 
successful when I got back to London.  The pe
rson who was in charge -- I put in charge 
then was Trevor Chadwick but there was a 
Mr. Barozetti who was secretary to Doreen 

Warriner and he kind of ran the office in wh
ich Tr evor Chadwick had space.  The first 
job of course  was as I said ther e were  fi ve committees in Pr ague at that time, was to get 

one central list.  I mean you can't  work from 
five lists and try to pick out who are the 
most important people or the most urgent cases
.  They were very diffident of course to 
give up their lists and having such a very shor
t time in Prague I had to use kind of black 
mail tactics bringing up eventually I think it
 was the communist committee saying that I 
had one list on which I would work and the othe
rs could join if they
 wanted to, otherwise 

none of the lists would be considered.  So with
in a couple of days we
 got a joint list and 
we discussed at that time how the office in 
Prague would have to work if I could be 
successful in London.  So, it was all a bit hair
y fairy and nebulous and it ma y happen and 
it may not. 

 But there was an awful lot to be done in Pr
ague if it did come  off.  They'd  have to 
get all these children together.  They'd have to get exit permits fr om the -- well, when I 

left Prague of course it wa sn't  the German 
authority because the Germans only arrived in 
March, but the time we really got going the Germ
ans were in charge because they arrived 
in March 1939 and then of course they had to
 get exit permits from the Germans for these 
children to leave.  They then had to arrive
 with ________ to get a tr
ain and then they had 
to arrange for escorts to go with the tr
ain.  They then had to find out from ____________ 
how much the operation would cost and we ha
d to send out money eventually to cover 
that cost which should have been used black
 ma il tactics and two days before the train 
was due to leave they'd say they want another thousand pounds or some thing which was a 

lot of money in those days which once you 
got all the children moving to a railway 
station in Prague and once you 
got all the people who are going 
to receive the children in 
England posted that they had to be at Liverpool
 St reet Station at a certain time , it's not an 
operation that you could cancel.  Whatever they'd ask for somehow or another we would 

have had to produce. 

 But there was a lot of work to be done in
 Prague and it was done very well.  The 
work we had to do in England was to find 
to me et the conditions which the home offi ce 

had laid down which was having a guarantor  50 pounds for each person which they 

designated as being money which would be used 
for the childr en's eventual repatriation at 

the end of the war, of course there wa sn't  a war to start with. 

 Then we slowly got people comi ng in sa
ying yes they would take a child and that 
accelerat ed when a lady came to me who had 
been working for the British committee and 
brought me  all the name s of their corresponden
ce throughout the country so I was able to 
use that with an appeal for children, which of 
course always brings re
sults whether it's for

handicapped children, lame  children, or blind ch
ildren.  For children and animals, the two 
most easiest things to get sympathy and raise money. 

 So, it went slowly but it did work.  We
 never got obviously as ma ny gua rantors as 
we wanted but we didn't have an awful lot of time to work on them and when we got the 

guarantee for a reasonable number of people we
'd do the paper work and send it out to 
Prague and Prague then had all the job of 
arranging the trains and the escorts and the 
money and dealing with all the parents and 
getting the children onto the train.  It was 
quite an operation in Prague. 
 

Q: When you'r e compiling lists of the childre
n, did all five commit tees end up cooperating? 
 

A: Well, as I say, we told each individual comm
ittee eventually that we can't  work with five 
lists, and before I left Prague they had agreed
 to coordinate and ma
ke one list and I think 
there was already one list before I left.  So, th
e people in Prague did wo
rk on that one list.  
Obviously it wasn't  only people who were on th
at list who came out.  I mean there were 
people very likely who weren't on the list 
who heard of this operation going on and 
wanted to send their children away.  I mean, 
how can you tell which are really the mo st 
urgent. I mean I suppose any Jewish child at th
at time was the most urgent politically of 
course, it was more difficult to decide and 
that one had to rely on the committees to do. 
 

Q: Were you present when the decisions were
 being ma de and were you involved in the 
decision ma king process? 
 

A: I was only concerned with the decision ma
king process in the end product of where the 
children were going.  I mean I was in Engla
nd so I couldn't in any way influence who 
came.  That was decided in Prague by Trevor
 Chadwick and with the aid of other people 
who were working there.  I suppose the records 
which I've got here th
at 92 percent of the 
children were Jewish so that 8 percent were either on Hitler's blacklist or  were 

communists or were writers or 
were children of that type wh
o were in danger, and I think 

we've hardly ma de any of them who ever saw 
thei r parents or relativ
es again.  Very few, 
very, very few. 
 So, I suppose that in itself 
shows -- I mean whatever Jew 
that was brought out was the  
 right Jew wasn't  it.  They were all in danger. 

 

Q: While you were in Prague, did you 
interview any parents, children? 
 

A: I was usually had people in my hotel room 
in Prague whilst I was shaving in the morning 
and usually followed until I put my head on the pillow at  night.  But ther e's very little I 

can reme mb er about that now, but yes, certa
inly people the whole 
time  were trying to 
influence you and leaving crates
 of pilsner beer behind.  We ll, you can imagine they tried 
to use what influence they could.  I don't th
ink we really, to be quite honest, took any 
notice of it.  You couldn't.  You have to be
 very tough in charitable work.  Feel soft 
hearted in charitable work it become s impossible.   You really got to 
treat it as a business 
and we had these lists and we went by them. 
 It's very likely that some  people threw 
influence from knowing people or in some  way 
or another got on the list ahead of other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
10 
 
 
people who were just as deserv
ing, but it was impossible.  You 
can't  sort it out like that.  
The same  as in social services today isn't it. 
 Lot's of people get on th
e lists that shouldn't. 
 
Q: When you returned to England you were wo
rking as a stockbroker by day and working 
out of your home  at night? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you feel that you were living two lives? 

 

A:  It's only difficult to 
ask me  how I felt 50 odd years ago, but no I don't think so.  I 
mean I just left one office and went home  a
nd did the other work.  It didn't seem strange 
to me at the time.  I had the police corp
 on me.  I reme mber asking why I had that 
enormous c orrespondence with Czechoslovakia fr
om a private house, but I think I was far 
too busy to entertain those kinds
 of thoughts at that time .  It
 was two different lives.  I 
mean people mostly on the stock exchange or
 a lot of people on the stock exchange I 
didn't talk to about what I was doing.  I mean
 nearly all of them or most of them had 

completely different political views and opinion
s to mi ne so there was really no point in 
discussing it.  They couldn't help in any way. 
 At least some of th
em who m I was more 
friendly with very likely gave
 me  some  money for the runni
ng of the office, but I can't 
really reme mber those details any more. 

 You see this story didn't exist for 50 y
ears at  all until suddenly the whole thing 
became public.  That's why all these children 
are meeting themselves for the first time 
and some  of them are making new friends.  
Some of them meeting people they didn't 
know existed and some  of them eve n finding relatives. 
 
Q: So people just if they knew considered it perhaps a quirk or
 so me particular interest but 
didn't inquire into it very extensively? 
 
A: Well, there was no common denomi nator 
where they could.  150 children comi ng ove r 
and disbursed all over the place in England.  Ne
arly all of them not finding their parent s 
any more.  Some  of them kept in touch w
ith each other but there was no organization or  
anything which in any wa y brought them togeth
er until five or six years ago when the 

story about the children broke. 
 

Q: Your colleagues didn't 
inquire into it either? 
 

A: I don't think when I left the city at 3:30 mo
st of the people knew what I was doing in the 
evenings.  I don't think so.  There was certa
inly nobody I knew in th
e city who in any 
way helped me  with what I was doing with re
gard to the children, nobody at all. It was 
two existences, separate, self contained. 
 

Q: Did your skills as a stockbr
oker aid you in doing this work? 
 

A: Oh, I don't think so, no. No, I don't think so. 
 No, I can't  think anything in stock broking 
or the arbitrage that I wa s doing helped in a
ny way, no.  I mean, after all, you didn't  need 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
11 
 
 
any special knowledge to bring children out.  
You needed a lot of effort and work and 
initiative and dealing with authority and all 
that, that was general knowledge.  It wasn't  
any particular knowledge.  It wasn't  like th
e workings of the stock exchange where you 
had to know how it worked and what the co
mmissions were and what you had to do and 
when you had to do it and for whom you had to do it and what the price wa s and 

reme mber the price when you were doing some
thing else.  It was 
nothing like that in 
dealing with children.  No, it was quite different. 
 

Q: What suited you for that job?   What suited 
you for that work with the children.  What 
ma de you the right person? 
 

A: I don't know.  That's for you to say.  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I've always -- if you 
call that charity work which I suppose it was I'
ve always done charity work.  I've been 
retired now for 28 years and I've done charity 
work for 28 years sin
ce then.  I don't know.  
It's just work I like doing.  You don't need 
any particular gift.  I don't know what urges 
one on to do it at all. 
 

Q: Will you describe your relationship with the 
Jewish community in Britain as they knew 
that you were doing this work? 
 

A: I had no connection with the Jewish commun
ity in England because I was brought up as a 
Christian.  I was baptized and 
I was brought up as a Christian.  My parents were Jewish 
but completely non-religious and I think that we
 were treated as rath
er a curiosity.  We 
didn't fit into either community. I mean th
e Jewish people thought we kind of opted out 
and at that time the Christian community must have thought -- I don't know I'm putting 

ideas into their mi nds now, it's rather a curi
ous Christian with a German-Jewish name .  
So, we really didn't fit into anybody and I 
suppose it was this kind of schizophrenia 
which ma de up a lot of my character at that time. 
 

Q: Was the Jewish community aware that you 
were working to rescue mostly Jewish 
children from Czechoslovakia? 
 

A: I suppose they were but I was very much -- 
it wa s very much me  and one or two people 
who were doing this.  I wasn't  assisted -- I 
mean the British committee for Refugees from 

Czechoslovakia I know a great number of thosewere yes, run by the Jewi sh people but I 

was quite separate to them, although I used th
eir name  until right to the end of the period 
in I think it was July, August when they said yes, you've been so successful now you 

better come  and join us and they gave me  a 
room at Bloomsbury House.  But until then I 
got no mone y from the m and no assistance from them.  In the various committees 

throughout the countries for whom most of the 
guarantees for the children came , I would 
imagine a lot of those were run by Jewish peopl
e, yes.  But I was only in touch with them 
by correspondence so I never real
ly met them in that way. 
 

Q: Did the British Refugee Committee gi
ve you permission to use their name? 
 

A: Oh, no, no.  I just used their name . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
12 
 
 
 
Q: Were there any repercussions? 

 

A: There was nothing they could do about it.  
The only repercussions we
re as I say after we 
had been doing that if you like 
illegally for nearly five m
onths  they then said this 
organiza tion calling themselves the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia 

Children's Section is some body who calls hims
elf Nicky Winton call
ing hims elf honorary 
secretary we declare that they'r e now part of
 our organization and we became  then a kind 
of accepted part of the gr oup.  Before it had b
een accepted in that way, in a kind of lega l 
way, it had been accepted by everybody who knew no better. People out in the country 

getting a letter fr om the British Committee Children's Section had no reason to believe 

that it wasn't  the British Committee 
as such.  So, it worked quite good. 
 

Q: When you say we did you have a
ny help writing these letters? 

 

A: I had a lady, a girl, who came to help me  
who ha d been working for the Christian council 
and she came every evening and she did all 
the typing, who in fact
 later on married 
Martin Blake.  I don't think we had anybody else. 
 We  were really just
 the two of us.  It 
was really a question of k
eeping the flow of corres
pondence going and getting the 
information in from Prague, getting pictur
es of the children so that when some body 
would take a child we could send them phot
os and ask them to pick a child, it's 
unfortunate commercial way of doing it.  Pe
rhaps that's where my stock exchange 
upbringing came  in, but it speeded things up at 
the time and we felt that speed was of the 
essence.

Q: I had just asked Mr. Wi nton if he would lik
e to say anything else
 about his relationship 
with me mbe r s of the Jewi sh community in Br
itain and what their 
response was to this 
work you were doing? 
 

A: Although most of the children we brought 
out were Jewish I was only looking for 
fa milies who looked after children.  I wasn't  c
oncerned at all whether these children went 
to Jewish or non-Jewish fa milies and this was 
largely due to the fact that I think that 
those people had been out in Prague and 
those people knew what I was doing, Martin 
Blake and Doreen Wariner and all that were
 very conscious of the urgency which one 
could see out there.  There was no question wh
en we were looking for a family to look 
after the children that a Jew should go to a 
Jew or a non-Jew should go -- it seemed to us 
at that time  perhaps because I'm non-religi
ous myself I don't know but it seemed to me 
completely secondary.  The chief thing was to
 save the children.  This was a not a view 
shared by everybody because there wa s one or
ganization in England which was called 
The Barbican Mission and they took quite a 
number of children.  I don't really know how 
ma ny.  I me an not an extraordinary number 
but quite a few children, and they were in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
13 
 
 
existence I found out later, I had no idea at 
the time merely to convert good Jews into 
good Christians which even when I heard it di
dn't  really alarm me  very much because 
after all they were saved.  And I thought 
the most important thing was to save the 
children rather than save the 
religion.  But I did have a deputy in my office once of rabbis 
who ca me  in ___________ and really told me  some thing for the first time some thing that 
I didn't know that these children that I wa
s bringing over and sending to the Barbican 
Mission were being ma de into Christians and I 
must stop this.  We  had quite an animated 
discussion about it and I think I must have to
ld them in no uncertain terms that I was 
trying to save the children not trying to 
save the religion and if anybody would take 
children, I didn't inquire into those matters and 
they were very cross at the time saying -- 
and when I said isn't it better to have 
a ___________ Jew rather than a dead one because 
we were fairly certain what was going on 
which very few people were at that time. 
 Anyway, what you asked me  what my 
connection with the Jewish community 
was at that  time that is one that I remember.  And, it still seems to me a rather unfortunate 

attitude if it did stop anybody comi ng over because
 they couldn't get into a Jewish family.  
It seems to be very unfair to confine that pers
on to oblivion rather than
 to a Christian life  
which after all they could cha
nge later on.  So, that was my one me mory of the Jewish 
community. 

 I wasn't  myself really in touch with the 
Jewish community as such at that time .  I 
mean in any case with a job during the day 
and this in the evening and on weekends, 
there wasn't  much time at that time for any ki
nd of social life.  Anyway, I was absorbed 
in this.  I liked doing it.  
I always liked doing charity wo
rk.  No particular __________ to 
me .  My son always says to me  that everybody applauds you for doing charity work and 

you'd be mi s e rable if you didn't.  So, 
that's  the other side of the coin. 
 

Q: How did you go about finding people to take these children? 
 
A: Well, as I say first of all through ce
rtain amount though Eleanor Rathbone and the 
Quakers and the Unitarian Church.  Then, as I 
said, Picture Post took it up and printed a 
letter of mi ne.  I think there's a copy in th
at book that you've just taken, every issue that 
they had and we got -- and then of cour
se by getting hold of the correspondence 
throughout the country of the British Committ
ee and when they got a letter from the 
British Committee Children's Section to them it was completely authentic and in a way it 

was authentic and that gave the story of the 
plight of the children out there and stated 
what we were looking for and most 
of our guarantors came from that. 
 

Q: Did you actually meet any of the familie
s that were to take these children? 
 

A: We have met some of the fa milies who took the children through the children now that 
we've met.  But of course a lo
t of them are dead.  A lot of
 them -- I think most of the 
children that we know say that
 the people who took them in 
originally are now dead and 
those -- one of the children who we know very
 well, Tom Be arma n who l i ves in a kibbutz 
on Lake Galilee he come s over and every time  he 's  in Europe he goes up to Glasgow to 

visit his Mama  and our great friend who lives 
near us in Maidenhead, Vera Gissing who's 
written a book called Bells of Childhood wh
ich no doubt you've got a copy of.  She 's 

always inviting her Mama  down 
and invites us round to meet he
r.  She must be very old 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
14 
 
 
now.  She's 90.  You see, a lot of them -- of 
the ones we know where the guarantor is still 
alive, they'r e very faithful in keeping in touch. 
 Of course, one must ad
mit that a lot of the 
children weren't happy where they were sent and there was an after care departme nt in 
fact when the war started that Mother 
looked after which tried when children had 
problems to get the pr oblems settled or get new guarantors for them.  But I certainly don't 

assume  and one cannot assume  that every ch
ild we brought over went into a home and 
was well treated and was happy.  A lot of them
 we know were.  We  certainly know some  
that were not, who were badly treated and used as servants. 

 But quite frankly at the time I didn't  th
ink of it and it really
 doesn't concern me  
very greatly now.  I mean you're bound to ha
ve some  who we ren't happy and all one can 
say is that they are still a
live whereas most of the other 
children aren't .  One knows that 
the children were targeted as much as the gr
ownups because the last transport was due to 
leave at the beginning of September.  It w
ould have been our bi
ggest. 250 children, an 
enormous a mount of work.  Can you imagine 
getting 250 children from all over the place 

onto a station in Prague and then getting 250 
guarantors to organize 
that they should all 
be at Liverpool Street Station at a certai
n time to receive the people whom they had 
taken.  Then, of course, war broke out.  The 
transport was cancelled and as far as we've 
heard from people who should not know a 
single one of those children survived. 
 So, as I say, I think when you do charity wo
rk as I said before, you've got to be 

pretty tough and if you were conc
erned more with the fact of 
are they going to be happy 
than have they got some body who will feed
 and clothe them, you wouldn't bring over 
nearly as ma ny.  I mean the whole operation woul
d really be different.  We   tried to and 
all the people who all these committees I talked
 to around the country they told us that 
they would not send us any person who woul
d take a child unless they ________ them so 
to a very great extent they were ____________, but it doesn't mean to say that some  don't 

go wrong and we know that some  did go wrong.   
 We 'r e in touch today with about 150 of thes
e children or they'r e in touch with me .  
That's out of 650 and of those most of them have done extremely well.  But you can't  tell 

whether the others have never 
heard of me or whether they 
did so badly or had such a 
mi serable life that they don't want to, so you 
really can't  draw any conclusions from the 
fact.  But a lot of them have done extremely we
ll.  A lot of them have ma de big name s for 
themselves.  One of them is in the House of 
Lords in England.  One of them is a big film 
producer in Israel.  Hugo Moron 
has ma de a big name  for himself.  He 's a big ma n in Tel 
Aviv, and a lot of them have done very well.  You can't  say whether the ma jority have 

because nobody has and I certainly haven't made
 any effort to get in touch with these 
people.  I mean we know that a whole lot we
nt to South America and I'm sure in South 
America they've never even heard of me.  It 
was only quite fortuitous
ly that it broke in 
England and was heard of in certain parts of
 the world but in a large number of places 
where certainly a lot of these children went, 
they have got no idea 
today how they came  
or why they came or
 who organized it. 
 

Q: How ma ny t r ansports were there all together? 

 

A: Six, I believe.  Yes, I think there were six. It's  in that book when you read it.  I believe 
there were six.  There ma y have been only five
.  But they'r e quite interesting statistics 
breaking them down into religion and all kinds 
of statistics which ar
e quite interesting. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
15 
 
 
 
Q: Did you meet any of the tran
sports when they arrived? 
 

A: All of them, all of them.  Yes, I was at 
Liverpool Street Statio
n when every transport 
arrived which was near to organized chaos as you
'll ever get.  And that in the name  we nt 
well.  One always has stor ies of those that 
got left behind on the platform because there 

was nobody to pick them up, but they were all 
looked after eventual
ly.  And again, the 
only trauma  that we ever had I'm afra id 
was with the orthodox Jews.  One of the 
transports arrived on a Sa turday and they w
ouldn't  sign for the children and they wouldn't 
carry their baggage and you can imagine wh
at we felt like.  You know, when it was 
some thing that seemed to us so unimportant
, imma terial, insignificant, but you couldn't  
let a child go until you had some kind of paperwork to say somebody had got them, and 

there they we re taking the child and no we can't
 sign it's Saturday.  So, I led Mother onto 
them then and she usually d
ealt with the situation.   
 

Q: What did she do? 

 

A: I don't know but she got them to sign.  I don't think she went as far as getting them to 
carry the baggage, but she certain
ly got them to sign, but then she was a very formidable 
lady. 
 

Q: Will you say a little bit more about her involve me nt? 

 

A: Well, nothing except Father had died and Moth
er was always interest
ed in what I did and 
when we did get into _____________ and we had an
 office and we started getting people 
writing in or perhaps even the guarantor 
would have died and 
obviously the question 
came back to the central office what do we do with the child, that was mother's 

departme nt then to find another guarantor or 
to deal with any problems that mi ght have 
arisen at that time.  She carried on when th
e war started because I was doing other things. 

 But as I say not all of them were as sa
tisfactory as one would have hoped but then 
one wouldn't have expected it.  You couldn'
t do an operation like that without some thing 
not being successful. It's not possibl e because af
ter all the children were di fferent.  Some  
of the children had no idea why they were 
there.  They thought their parents were 
following them.  Some of them were very 
upset because their parents had sent them 
away, doesn't  Mommy love me  anymore.  So
me  of them were old enough to know why 
they came, but there was a lot of disparit
y amongst the children themselves which we 

hear now, not knowing why they were sent.  Ho
w awful for Mother to get rid of us.  No 
idea why.  How should they know what it was 
all about.  Some of them were very young. 
 So, there is no standard case.
  Either as to the family they went to nor as to the 
child's attitude at that time.  Some of them
 adjus t ed well.  Some  of the m quite frankly 
never adjusted and never will.  But most of 
the ones, the ones that we me t now recently at 
Fort Lauderdale, most of them have done extr
emely well.  They were
 all very nice and 
perfectly composed and ordi
nary citizens, but then it was a small mi nority when you 
think of the kindred meeting that we've just 
had at Ft. Lauderdale, where I had to say a 

few words.  There were a hundred.  Now, most
 of them were on the German transports 
which had nothing to do with me  at all of wh
ich there were 10,000 and of what I call my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
16 
 
 
group that came  out of Czechoslovakia over 
600, there were four, so I me an you can't  
tell.  Why were just those four and those 
odd hundred present.  We re they the ones that 
had just heard about it.  Were they the su
ccessful  ones?   You know, it's very difficult if 
anybody was really writing it up in serious 
history.  After an enormous a mount of 
research really to find out fundame nt al what 
had happened because all 
that is written and 
what is done are those people who have co
me  for ward if you like, perfectly voluntary, 
they needn't have done and one doesn't  know wh
y the other -- all righ
t there were 100 out 
of 10,000 of the Germans there.  Is it a geographi
cal reason?   Is it for some  other reason?   
Is it because they had the money because it's 
jolly expensive to spe
nd three or four days 
to come  to Ft. Lauderdale and pay in the hotel we were.   

 So, I would hesitate to draw any standard
 conclusions really as to the whys and 

wherefores.  All one knows rea
lly is that yes, those that 
we brought out should have been 
brought out because if they weren't they woul
dn't exist.  That one knows as the absolute 

standard and definite fact.  The rest isn't f
act but the best is well it ma y not be, you don't 
know.  The ones we've me t now 
I mean like ________ couldn't  be
 a more normal or nice 
person but is she the mi nority, the ma jorit
y, the standard?   One 
doesn't  know.  I don't 
know and I suppose anybody ever will know.  A lo
t of people pretend to know.  A lot of 
people write that this is what
 happened and all this but alot of it is fantasy, thinking, 
hoping what they hoped perhaps happened. 

 As I say we are delighted when we meet 
the m and a lot of the people that we meet 
are absolutely delight ful have all done extremely well, but we only meet the mi nority of 

the people that we brought out.  I mean, a 
lot of them ma ybe  di
d, but if anybody wanted 
to do research and try to find 
out what had happened to 640 children they've got a heck of 
a job. 

 
Q: In those days you didn't have much furthe
r contact after you met the m at the Station, 
they'd go off with thei r -- 
 

A: None at all.  I had that job to do a
nd when that job was done, well anyway, the war 
started and I was doing other things.  Because
 of my experience politically and because 
of what I saw in Czechoslovakia and feeli
ng that  it was all so inevitable that the 

politicians could have done ot
her things, I started the war 
as a consciousness objector and 
I was in the Red Cross on the continent to 
st art with.  Later on I joined the R.A.F. 
because eventually one gets drawn into these th
ings.  As I said, most of t hem we me t are 
absolutely delight ful.  One would like to think it's the majority or even al l of them are 

like that. 
 

Q: When the war began, it was very clear th
at you couldn't go on doing this kind of work, 
right? 
 

A: Oh, no.  It was stopped.  As I tell you, the 
last transport never came, whic h would have 
been the biggest.  An enormous a mount of work had been done.  You can imagine 

processing 250 children in Prague.  Finding 
250 guarantors and home s in England.  All 
the amount of work that was.  It was pretty 
awful, just by a day.  If the train had been a 
day earlier it would have come  through.

Q: You were a consciousness objector and then you 
joined the Red Cross, is that right?  And 
what were you doing with the Red Cross at that point? 
 
A: I went with the first ambulance unit to the 
continent and came out at
 the time  of Dunkirk 
and then as I said I joined the R.A.F. At
 the end, you know, it's all inevitable once war 
really starts whether you think it could have 
been stopped or not.  It's  really imma terial 

fi nally isn't it.  It's there. 
 

Q: How long were you with the Red Cross? 

 

A: Eight months I think, I believe.  I can't  re
me mber.  It's not long ago, only about 60 years 
ago, but I can't  re me mbe r . 
 

Q: The Royal Air Force, you joined voluntarily? 

 

A: Oh, yes.  Most of the people we'r e meeting he
re are with the R.A.F.  So me  were with the 
Czech Air Force. 
 

Q: Can you describe briefly what 
you were doing in the air force? 
 

A: Well, it's not terribly intere
sting.  I had flown privately so 
I was a pilot in 
civil life.  I 
mean I wasn't  a pilot professionally but I did fly as a hobby.  When I joined up though I 

couldn't become a pilot because of my eyesi
ght so I became an instructor in what was 
called the Link, which was a machine teaching pilots night flyi ng.  Which was interesting 

because my knowledge of French I had a lot of
 French pilots who were expert in low 
level flying and didn't know where they were 
when they got into a cloud so the Link wa s 
supposed to show them what they did when they got into a cloud and as a thank you they 

took me  low level flying which was pretty haza
rdous for them.  They had two trees they 
didn't go over them, they went sideways through them.  It was very exciting. 
 

Q: How much did you know during the time th
at the war was going on about what was 
happening in the camps and that there 
were concentration camps in Europe? 
 

A: Nothing at all.  There was nothing certain.  
I don't think there was anything in the papers 
about it.  Anyway, one was doing other things then. 
 

Q: Did you give much thought dur
ing that time  to these childr
en that you had just brought 
over?  
 

A: No, I don't think so.  I mean it was a job th
at I did and it was a job which was completed 
as far as I could complete.  There was nothing 
else to be done.  I was doing other things.  
When I was in London, I obviously was told th
at certain of the children had been in 
trouble and had to be moved from one place to
 another, but ot her people were looking 
after that.  No, I didn't get very  -- I 
didn't get involved in that in any way.

Q: You spent after the Royal 
Air Force and the war ended, what did you do after you were 
with the Air Force?  
 
A: Oh, when the war ended I joined the 
Committee for Refugees in London, thinking it 
would be having got so ma ny peopl e out from wh
ere they should have been it was best to 
join a pl ace to try to get them back again, a
nd I joined this inter-governmental commi ttee 

in London which was take n over or became pa
rt of it's more accurate to say, the 
International Refugee Organization in 
Geneva.  We became employed by the 
International Refugee Organization in Geneva 
which was one of the specialized agencies 

of the United Nations and my job there was re
ally nothing to do with
 the repatriation of 
refugees.  I worked with an American
 called ______________ dealing 
with the sorting 
out of all the German loot that had been 
found in the various caves and everything, false 

teeth and glasses and bags and fountain pens  and everything you could imagine was all 

crated up and given to us to sort out.  Enor
mous bags and sacks and quantities of watches 
and alarm clocks, jewelry and we had experts 
over from America to 
sort out the jewelry, 
to find out the real diamonds and the real em
eralds and everything from the rubbish and 
all the jewelry just as on
e part of the operation was then sent to the ____________ in 
Frankfurt and I had to go ther
e and supervise the sorting out 
of this again and eventual 
smelting it down by _____________ into gold ingot
s which I then took to London and 
sold and the money went to the Je wish Agency because this was just be fore the Jewish 

state was founded and it went to a Mr. Kapl
an who was the treasurer of the Jewish 
agency and became the first chancellor of
 the __________ of Israel.  Everything else I 
took to Ame r ica where it was auctioned off and 
again the money sent to Israel -- well the 

Jewish Agency. 
 

Q: You were based in Geneva? 
 
A: Yes, I was based in Gene va.  I was ve ry 
little there because I was always either in 
Frankfurt or taking the stuff acro
ss the Atlantic for sale.  It's 
a very big story the story of 
the liquidation of all the German loot and it's 
really one of the stories which I don't think 
has ever been told.  Before all this stuff 
was s melted I had a came ra and I took photos of 
it in the vaults of the ___________ in Frankf
urt with one bulb and about 20 mi nute 
exposures which came out very well and very 
good pictures of all 
the jewelry and false 
teeth and gold evening bags and anything 
you can imagine that was taken then.   

 I reme mber only one person who really came down into the ________ bank to see 

what was going on and that was ___________, at the 
time.  I wrote all this up as a ma tter 
of fact and it's  a big book and that I pr
esented to the ____________, and I've got a copy 

of everything that was wr itten there, but of 
course, I haven't got the pictures any more.  
That's  an interesting story, very interesting.  
It tells more than a 
lot of articles written 
about the time .  You see a picture of a crate 
of false teeth.  You s
ee a picture full of 
spectacles which we had to smelt down to get th
e gold out of.  Really, it tells more of the 
story than all kinds
 of books can tell. 
 But as I say, when I went to the ____
__________ to give them the original of that 
book, I thought they'd better have it as well.
  I mean so ma ny people have taken up 
writing stories about the children, but I don't know
 of any books that have been written 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422

about the finding and the liquidation of all the 
stuff that was taken fr
om the Jews at that 
time.  You'll have to follow it up. 
 
Q: How was it found? 

 

A: Well, it was found by the Ar my I'm told in a 
cave, or in caves, and of course we got it 
from the Army, but when we got it the Army 
ha d already sorted it 
through to a certain 
extent and we didn't get any of the paintings. 
 Presumably they had found out the owners.  
We didn't get things like fur coats and we
 didn't get anything by carpets. I don't know 
what they did with them, but I think to st
art with they tried to fi nd the owners.  
 I don't really know, but we got the stu
ff which obviously needed an enormous 
amount of work done on it.  It couldn't be ha
ndled in any other way and for which it was 
then absolutely impossible to find the owners
.  But it was a nasty 
feeling for weeks and 
weeks and weeks dealing with al
l of that.  It was awful. 
 I reme mber going into the _____________ and a
ll these things we
re stored there 
when we dealt with it and ther
e were crates and crates for 
example of alarm clocks and 
you walked into that place and the me re fact 
of creating a certain vibration in the room 
some  of the alarm clocks started ringing all ove
r the place.  It was quite eerie and we sa id 
at the time having sorted it through, this stu
ff is absolutely worthless and these are 
interiors of watches and which is absolutely
 worthless.  The out
side was smelting down 
because it was gold or silver or some thing a
nd one of the conditions on which we were 

working was none of this was allowed to go back to the German economy so when we 

said look we have all these crat
es that are absolutely worthles
s interior of watches and old 
alarm clocks they said well you'll have to cr
ate it up and on your trip take the good stuff 
for sale in America you'l l  have to get rid of it.  And we had a ceremony which there is 

also pictures of that, in the mi ddle of the Atlantic bringing out these 
crates onto the deck.  
Some body standing there with a big ax and ma
king a hole in it and then chucking these 
crates overboard in mi d Atlantic.  It's quite an
 interesting story, but as
 I say lots of people 
are writing about the children 
and all that but I haven't seen
 any stories written about all 
this loot  business which to my mi nd is just
 as interesting -- it doesn't  deal with 

personalities and people but it deal
s with a very important story. 
 
Q: How long were you working in this capacity? 

 

A: I stayed with the I.R.O. until April '48 and th
en I went to the International Bank in Paris. 
 

Q: During the time  that you were working with
 the I.R.O. you we re 
only working with the 
loot?  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: It must have been a huge amount?  

 

A: Well, there was a huge amount but it was all 
very complicated work.  I mean when you're 
given a sack of jewelry and you had to firs
t of all to find out what was good and you had 
these experts who would come  
fr om America and all this was displayed and they had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
20 
 
 
pick out the good stuff.  My only success was lo
oking at all the stuff that they left behind 
one day and I thought I'd just 
look through it for fun and I found 
one of the most valuable 
pieces of jewelry all toge ther.  So, everybody is 
fallible.  It just happened to be one of the 
pieces they mi ssed. 
 
Q: Did anyone come  trying to reclaim any of the goods? 

 

A: At that period, no.  I doubt if very ma
ny people knew what was going on.  I don't know.  
It's a story which hasn't  as I'm saying told
 since and I don't think 
there were ma ny people 
who knew what was going on at that time .  I don't  think so.  I don't know.  I  don't know.  

I know that of the loot before it came to us 
there were things that
 were identifiable and 
where possible were returned.  I've only h
eard that.  I don't know who did it and how it 
was done.  Up to that point it was an army operation.  We  got the stuff from the army and 

their brief of what we should do was limited 
and was regulated by the Paris Reparations 
Agreement and we had to work under the Paris Re parations Agreement which stated I 

think it was as most of t his stuff belonged 
to the Jews 95 percent should go to the Jews 

and I think five percent went to the Christia
ns.  So, our job was to get 95 percent of it 
converted into a way that it could be used 
and the only way that we could do that was 
converting it into ingots or taking the good 
stuff all the good jewelry over to America 
where it was auctioned. 
 

Q: You must have been aware at that poin
t of what had happened during the war and the 
scale of the atrocities? 
 

A: Well, I think one knew that.  When the last  
transport didn't come  and 
we were told at the 
time by the Germans that any of the children th
at we exposed in that way were going to 
be  -- one knew then what was really going 
on.  You can't  have all those parents giving 
up their children without realiz
ing that there was some thi
ng going on could you?   It wa s 
certainly evident.  You wouldn't give up your 
child or three or four
 and stay behind in 
danger unless you were fairly certa
in that it was going to be pr
etty horrible for the child if 
he stayed there.  Oh, no, I th
ink one knew what was happening. 
 

Q: What did you say that you did afte
r you stopped working for the I.R.O.? 
 

A: Well, I fi rst of all went to the International Bank in Paris wher e I met my wife who was 
working for the International Bank in Paris, 
and when that job finished we earned so 
much mone y in dollars being grossly over paid
 by the United Nations, which is still going 
on I believe that we came to America as the 
first tourists really because nobody else in 
Europe could get dollars. 
 

Q: When was this? 

 

A: Nobody in Europe could get dollars to come  to America? 

 

Q: What year was this? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422  
21 
 
 
A: 1950.  And if we had gone back to England at
 that time  we would ha
ve had to give up our 
dollars which we decided not to do and so we came here in 1950 and spent three months 
in America.  We  thought we'd seen an awful 
lot and we looked at that ma p and saw that 
we had seen one little corner
 and apart from being very 
interesting going around Ame r ica 
the only interesting thing was that we were li
terally the fi rst tourists.  I mean when we 
were asked where are you going to live and we
 said we were going back to England the 
reply was absolutely alwa ys the same .  W
hy are you going back?   Don't you like it here?   
The idea of a tourist comi ng to America didn'
t exist.  Nobody could get the money and 
there were no such things as tourists.  So 
we toured America.  We  went up to Canada.  
We ca me  back and then I started working in 
all kinds of jobs until 
I retired 28 years ago.  
Since then I have done charity work for th
e me ntally handicapped and for the frail 
elderly.  So, in two words that brings you up to date. 
 

Q: Was your wife aware of the work you had done
 in rescuing Czech children before the war 
began?  
 

A: No, I don't think she knew it, no.  Nobody knew.
  It was just some thing I had done and it 
was fi nished.  Until six years ago actually 
through the Maxwells, Robert and Betty 
Maxwell it certainly became  in the public domain. 
 

Q: How did that occur? 

 

A: Well, only because I wanted to get ri
d of these papers and coul dn't find anybody 
interested until some body took me  one day to 
Dr. Betty Ma xwell who was organizing an 
exhibition of the 50th anniversary of the Holo
caust and she was terr ibly interest ed.  A 
ma rvelous lady and she of course told Robert
 and Robert told th
e Sunday Mirror and the 
Sunday Mirror then interviewed me  a nd all th
ese articles appeared 
in the Sunday Mirror, 
and the editor of the Sunday Mirr
or, _________________ and then they got onto the 

Esther Ransom show and through Vera Giss
ing really then the 
whole thing started 
snowballing.  It's all quite extraordinary. 
 

Q: You hadn't thought muc h a
bout during all those years? 
 

A: No, it was a finished episode
 as far as I was concerned. 
 

Q: Were you surprised? 

 

A: We were terribly surprised at the Es
ther Ransom because we didn't know anybody and 
we weren't told that anything was happening.  
The people like that ma ke a terrific impact 
and I went up to the st udio.  Greta didn't even come because I was told it was merely to 

go through some  script that Esth
er Ransom had before it started.  And I was kept waiting 
and I was put in a seat and I saw one person 
I knew and I wasn't  allowed to move because 
unknown to me  the ca me ras had been trained on a 
certain seat that had been reserved for 

me and only then when the program star
ted did I know that everybody around me  we re 
these children.  So, everybody st
arted crying.  It was very em
otional, not very pleasant. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0422

Q: It must have been overwhelming? 
 

A: Yes, it was pretty awful.  But she got her 
program that she wa nted.  She was in tears at 
the end herself. 
 

Q: Do you have mi xed feelings now about 
having all of these people in your life? 
 

A: No, I don't think so.  I enjoy it.  Some ti me s it become s a bit overwhelming and a big 
effort for us to decide to come  over at all. 
 It's quite an effort to come  over and face 
everybody and talk, like to you. 
 

Q: After 50 years I would imagine it would be. 

 

A: It's more than 50 years now, more like 60. 

 

Q: I'm happy that you did come  and talk.  Thank you. 

 
Conclusion of Interview
