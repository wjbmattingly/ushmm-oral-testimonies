organizations, cause -- cu -- this was called the real
istic Zionism, because th-the -- doesn™t exist any 

more. And I -- I -- we had the -- in Czechoslovaki
a, you could declare in -- yourself as Jewish by 
nationality, because there was the 
-- there was a multi-national law in
 Czechoslovakia. And we always 
declar ed Jewishness nash -- nationality.

A: We  ed -- were -- we used to have Jewish -- 
A2: Friends? 

A: Y-Yes, because w-we  hadn™t any Czech friends. 

Q: No Czech friends? 

A: No. 

Q: Why was  that? 

A: Because th -- th -- bi -- in my
 -- in Brno, the Jews stuck toge ther, 
because i-it -- th -- the Czechs and 
the Germans didn™t like the Jews. They don™t -- no, 
i -- th-the -- if their na
tionality was recognized, 
because i-in Jewish -- got everywhere, so yes,
 Jews were considered legal and citizen of 
Czechoslovakia, and they
 could get anywhere.  
A2: But there was no soci al intermingling? 

A: That is coo -- too complicated as
 the questions. Where -- there -- what -- he -- because the Germans, 
for instance, in -- in Czechoslovaki a, this -- there™s 
-- were the social democrat
ic party because a -- one 
of the Germans was a Jew, and was mi nister in the Czech governme nt. 

Q: Did the Jews live together?

etto, because they lived everywhere.

gue, i-in the first di strict, that w-was almost 
hundred percent Jewish, but they could live anywhere.

A: N-No, no, Brno was not the case. 

Q: Okay. What language 
did you speak growing up? 
A: German and Czech, because my sister wer -- 
was born in -- was Czech, because she knew German 
also, because the rest of the family kne
w Ger man, and Czech as a second language. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491

Q: What language are you 
most comfortable in now? 
A: English. Because I had -- I spoke f s-seven langua
ges, because I know the seven language, bec -- I 
cannot express myself fl uently. Because 
I speak English also f -- not fluently. 
Q: It™s quite fluent, come  on. 

A: Yeah, because I wrote the book in English, and the editor was e-enthusiastic, because he has no 

work. A -- a -- this is -- was a bad 
book, because the Jews di dn™t like it. 
Q: What was the book? 

A: ﬁBalaam™s Curse.ﬂ 

Q: Which means? 

A: Bicsees -- Balaam wa s a non-Jewish prophet, becau
se he pr oclaimed the -- the Jews would not be a 
people unlike all the other, and Jerusalem [indeciphe
rable] separate. Becau -- 
at the heart, Jewish 
people drifted. That is
 -- that is not good. 
Q: When did you write the book? 
A: Oh, it was five years ago, six years. 
A2: No, but we™ll see, you finished the book before th
e second stroke, so it 
must have been published 
before ™94.

A: Here. 

A2: Here, or there?

Q: What kind of school did you go to? 
A: Jewish school, because it is -- was the Jewish secu
lar school, because we have

high school, four years, the religion. Because that™s wa
s the -- also the other schools had religious also.

 go to a non-Jewish school?

A: Yes. 
Q:  - -  gr a d uat e d?  

A: Yes. 

Q: Now, wa s it co-educational? 

A: Yes.  

Q: Were all the -- were the teachers Jewish and non-Jewish, or  all Jewish? 

A: No, because there were non Jews a -- Jewish t
eachers, because there we re not enough Jews who 
wanted to be teachers.  

Q: It -- was your father very 
politically involved
?  I mean, you say he was a Zionist, but was he -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- was he very active, was he holding meetings in the home? 

A: No, no, no, no, no. He played br idge. Because i -- i --
 every afternoon have -- we went to the coffee 
house, and we played bridge.

Q: Okay. Was -- was your mother also a Zionist? 

A: No. My mother was -- he -- 

A2: She. 

A: She went to the opera house, most  of the time. 
And I too, because it was just five mi nutes from our 
home , the opera house.

nd culture, or what kind of fa mily life did you have, 

other than bridge for your dad, and opera for your mo m?  

A: I don™t understand.

A: Together? 
Q: Mm. 

A2: With your parents. 

A: No, not -- we have a very good upbringing, because
 we -- we had little social d -- social -- 

A2: A small social  circle. 

A: Yes. 

A2: Of friends? 

A: Because [indecipherable] friends, 
because be -- he was the son of 
the principal of the school. I don™t 
know whether the others, you know, others pu -- Jewish
 people had friends,be -- because we were 
satisfied with what we had. 

Q: What did it mean to you as a child that your fath
er was a Zi onist? What meaning did that have for 
you? 

A: I was a Zionist too, because we were in the Je
wish school, which was a Zionist school, which ha d 
even Hebrew.  

Q: So when you were growing up, was it with the id
ea that you would move to
 Israel, what was the 
idea? 

A: No, because it was not possibl e to move to
 Israel because the British didn™t allow it. 
Q: So what was your goal?  What -- what
 did your father say was the ideal? 
A: I -- I -- before the German occupation, we lived in
 the -- in a -- a separate environment -- Jew -- was 
Jewish. 

Q: And then? 

A: Zionist -- bec -- then the Germans came, and I w-w-
wanted my father to -- to
 regis -- je -- register 
myself as the Jew, because the ge -- the Germans as
ked the [indecipherable] because the Jewish -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
11 
 
je -- the rel --  the religious Jewish community, all th
e Jews ha -- must be re-r
ecognized, and I asked my 
father not to recognize me , because I -- 
A2: Not to register you. 

A: Yeah, register is, because I -- when I was t --
 I w-w-was as a young man very pessimistic, because I 
wanted to go out, because my father wouldn™t allo
w it, because he regi stered myself as the whole 
fa mily. But of course -- and I ri -- 
entered the -- the Hehalutz move me nt
, and I went -- and -- t-to work 
in a village, because they have ran out -- th-t
here were not -- is enough working places for young 

people, because all young people register
ed with Hehalutz becau
se the -- I th -- think it was fi -- till 25, 
till 26 years of age. 

Q: Okay, so let me  go back a little bit though. 

A: Yes.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
12 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: All right. What was -- what was it like in Brno then? In ™36, what was the climate? 

A: We ll, the climate -- all people who wanted to st
udy, co-could study at university, because we ha d as 
[indecipherable]  

A2: It™s matricul ation. 

A: Yes, yes, because I want to study, I want to -- to
 the me dical school, and we were there, and it -- the 
students were also fascists, ver-very -- very -- as
 a g-group, the student s were fascists, because they -- 

they were unfriendly relations to the Jews, becau
se [indecipherable] ma ked demonstrations against 
Jews, right? 

Q: Was there a quota system for Jews? 

A: No, no, no, no, no. 

Q: So Jews could get into the -- 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Not a -- not a problem? 
A: Not, not a problem.

 seme ster [indecipherable] were 15 - 16 Jews. 
Q: Out of how ma ny students? 

A: Hundred. 

Q: But did you feel prejudiced against?  Or 
did you feel conspicuous as a -- as a Jew?  
A: No, no. Because they were very frie
ndly, but the -- the groups were fascists. 

Q: So what repercussions did that have for you? 

A: No, no practica -- practically [indecipherable]
 no, no, no. Because the -- the teacher, and -- of 
anatomy wa s a fascist, but she -- we didn™t feel any --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
13 
 
A2: Discrimi nation? 
A: What? 

A2: Discrimi nation? 

A: Yes. Because it -- in -- in -- in exams there we
re hundred percent all right, because -- because there 
was one teacher was -- there were no Jews, not [indeci
pherable] because the Jewish professors went to 
the German™s university. Because Brno was a -- a -- was divi de d between -- between Czechs and 

Germans, be cause one teacher of embuology -- 

A2: Embryology. 

A: Embryology, once made the statement, ﬁIf you don™
t like Jews, you can go to hell.ﬂ Because there 
were s -- w-was demons trations against Jews.

Q: So -- so describe it, please. 

A: I was -- wasn™t present. 

Q: So did they put up posters?  

A: Yes, yes.  

Q: Is that how you knew? 

A: No, no, no. Because a -- they ca -- got
 up and shouted at Jedei ren -- 
A2: Jews away. 

A: Jews away. Because that professor told the Jews 
-- the non-Jews, to go away from the lectures. He 
will -- he lectures only to the Jews, because that
 is not serious, but beca
use the -- if you continue 
[indecipherable] this, this was pleasant. 

Q: What year was this that the demo nstrations started? 

A: Because y -- y -- th-that was in 
the -- in the -- in that year that 
the [indecipherable] that German was 
-- 

A2: Annexed. 

A: All -- was annexed to Germany, t o Hitler.

Q: There were only -- the demonstrations, were
 they outside of school
 as well?  We re there 
demonstrations against Jews? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
15 
 
A: Because the fas -- the fascists, because this w-was a mi nor ity of fascists. 
A2: But in Brno itsel f --

at the university? 
A: No, only iv -- I don™t reme mber, no -- 
th -- not demonstrations, no. Public, no. 
Q: No?  

A: No. In our city, that were no demonstrations. 

Q: So w-w-when -- when the annexation occu
rred, did you f -- then feel vulnerable or not? 
A: Yes, because -- because annexations was on the 15
th
 of March, sic -- 1939, because we were -- all 
were -- we were excluded of the -- to 
public coffeehouses, restaurants, you g -- 

A2: They threw you out of the university.

A: I wa -- wa  -- because in the pra -- six months pr
ior to the occupations, I was expelled of -- of -- as 
the school because I was born in -- in Drogobych, becau
se I -- I -- I could -- I coul d -- I could go on 
because it™s -- it™s -- recognize that 
I was not a foreigner, because I was only born in Poland, because I 
was a Czech, and my father w-was a -- a st ate professor 
in -- in high school, because  they -- they let me  
study. [indecipherable] I didn™
t want  to, because I thought that this was no use. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
16 
 
Q: You thought it was no use to keep studying? 
A: Ye -- yes, because I wa -- wa 
-- I was always a pessimi st, I thought 
Hitler, and I -- it -- and I knew 
what was comi ng. 

Q: So you were expelled? 

A: No, no, becau -- I didn™t regi s -- register myself anew. 

Q: You didn™t register yourself? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And tell me  about that. 

A: Why?  

Q: What -- y-y-you were supposed 
to register all over again? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: With who m? 

A: With the uni -- university, with the university.  
Q: For another seme ster, you mean? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Fir -- fifth seme ster. 

Q: When you were almost done? 

A: Yes -- no, because th-that was only one third of the -- the medical studies.

A: [indecipherable] because my fr
iend was born in Roma nia because he applied against this expulsion, 
and he was --  he was re-admitted in s -- in -- at  the re --  university. 

Q: Okay, now you -- you say you were always a pessimi st. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And then when -- when Hitler came
 to power  you said, what™s the use. 
A: We ll, yes. 

Q: Okay. So how -- when did you become  aware 
of -- of Hitler and -- a
nd of the pessimi stic

Ge rmany, and ga -- anne xe d Austria and I was 
convinced that Czechoslovaki

Q: Did your father think so too? 

A: Yes, he thought so too, because he  never spok
e about it, because he was a pupil -- a -- a -- got a 
German pupil, yeah, because in the la
st -- in the last few years, he 
was teaching at the German school, 
because the -- the Czech -- the Jewi
sh school was all Czech, because th

A: Yes, failed him, and he -- he went  to court a
nd the court freed him, because two students beca --

succeed. I -- I -- I -- 

Q: Your father sounds like a very generous ma n. 

A: Yes. Generous, this is -- my father was all the --
 he was fair. And he died -- he was 59, he died of 
lung cancer, because at that time , that -- weren™

ng around you and came to 
power, how did that affect your father™s
 political activitie
s, do you reme mber? 
A: Yes, because he wrote to his -- to
 his relatives in America, and -- a
nd asked them to get a -- a -- get 
us out, because it -- it™s just not pos
sible, because then he tried England, and it was there not possibl e,

Segonkovich was his name .  

Q: You have an amazing me mory. 

A: No, no, because a -- no, my me mo ry is gone. 

Q: Fooling me , I™ m telling you. At 
what point was your life as a -- as a Jew determined by being 
Jewish, so that whatever freedoms 
you ma y have had, say to go to me
dical school as a Jew, at some 
point, those freedoms were removed. 

A: Yes. 

Q: At what point was that, and 
what do you reme mber about that? 
A: Well, we were -- the Jews were victims alread -- 
already in ™39, because all the -- the laws were -- 
were -- were -- the Jews were submitted to laws, 
because the Germans took the -- took -- I -- I don™t 
ger -- Germans -- what -- 

Q: Well, they en -- they enacted 
a number of very severe laws . 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Because that 
is why I went from the family to the -- to -- to the 

[indecipherable] because they wanted to prepare the Jews for emigration. 

Q: Emigration? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
21 
 
A: Yes. Becau -- they -- there were a number of Jews
 who emigrated, of course --
 of j -- of course also 
to Palestine, because this 
were a small group of Jews. 
Q: Did your father consid
er going to Palestine? 
A: No. 
Q: No?  

A: No, because h-he -- he  didn™t consider it.  

Q: I™m surprised. 

A: Yes? 

Q: Do you reme mber your parents talking about 
what to do?  Do you remember any of that? 
A: Yes, because he was worried about the children, b
ecause he wanted to -- to get to America and to 
England because he -- not -- didn™t consider himself 
as -- he was -- he was really -- real -- realist, 
because he di dn™t talk. 

Q: What do you mean he didn™t talk? 
A: Because he -- he was with his [indecipherable] he -- he
 wanted to be exact -- to
 s -- take a Jewish ba 
-- he wanted Jews -- wait a second. 
Q: You want -- do you want a break? 

A: Yes. 

Q: A little br eak? Sure.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is tape one, side two, of the in
terview with Moshe Leshem. Okay, so yes? 
A: The time the Jews did not think bo -- of the Ho
locaust , the [indecipherable]
 because they -- they -- 
there were restrictions, and severe 
restrictions, but they -- there was no 
transportation of -- to the -- to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
22 
 
Poland, and there was no -- no imme diately -- imme di
ate danger of death, because I was not convinced 
that this would end well.  
Q: What did other people think at the time, when a
ll of the laws came down against Jews, what -- did 
people think this was just  a 
fluke, temporary, go away -- 
A: Yeah, yes -- no. Because th -- th-the -- they woul
d -- they went along with 
the restrictions because 
they -- they couldn™t imagine that they would come  
down to this, because the majority of the Jews 
didn™t think of that. 

Q: We re -- were Jews required to live in
 specific locations at  this point? 
A: No, no. [i ndecipherable] not, because then was a 
period when whe -- wh -- we [indecipherable] my 
fa mily was expelled of -- fr om the -- fr om the apartm
ent and they w-were forced in this -- i-in one 
room. 

Q: Your fa mily was kicked out of their apartment? 

A: Yes, yes. Because this happened to everybody. 
Q: When wa s this? 
A: I don™t know, but this was in ™40 -- ™42. 

Q: Okay, so much later? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay, but the apartment that you grew up in as a 
chi -- did you grow up in an apartment or a house? 
A: Na -- wa -- apartment. 

Q: And how ma ny rooms in that apartment? 

A: Not -- wa -- we -- was si -- si -- cause we lived till March 15
th
, of ™39, and in a three room apartment 
which belongs to the Jewish co-community. And -- ye
s, because th -- there wa
s a -- a synagogue in the 
-- in the --   

A2: Backyard. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
23 
 
A: Y -- th-the backyard, a-and the -- 
the offices were there, and the Zi
onist offices were there also, and 
th -- there were two cantors leaving it, because the ge -- German came and -- and expelled two -- most 
of the -- all of the tenant
s, because -- we were lucky, because 
we went before the [indecipherable] 
because the Jewish community took over the whole house.
 Because we were not -- we were not part of 
the yeb -- sha -- we weren™t part of the Jewish 
community, because we were not functionally, because 
w-we -- that -- then we moved to the modern a-ap
artment, which was only two -- two rooms, and one 
room for the -- for the help, wh
ich was given to my sister.  
Q: Okay, but that was -- that was when, though? 

A: That was -- that was -- 

Q: So that was still in ™38? 

A: Ye -- no, no, no. Yes, yes. 
Bix -- te -- the end of ™38. 
Q: Okay. Which was the s -- and 
at that point you were no longe
r in school, is that right? 
A: Yes, I ji -- I 
di -- was in school. 
Q: Okay. I am getting so confused. Okay, you w -- 
you get out of -- you expelled yourself from school 
-- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- basically. We re you then st
ill living with your parents? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. You -- and you™re tutoring Latin. 

A: Yes. Once -- one pupil. 

Q: I take it you didn™
t do that for long. 
A: No, because the Germans came , I -- I was with Hehalutz. 

Q: Okay, so tell me  about getting with
 Hehalutz. Why did you decide to do that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
24 
 
A: What -- what all young Jews did 
at that time , because I™ve regist er
 with Hehalutz and they -- they 
accepted me . 
Q: We re there both youn
g me n and young wome n? 
A: Yes. 

Q: A-And they accepted you to do what? 

A: To wait. Because they h-had to or da -- the 
-- the organizations was trying to find workplaces, 
because which it -- and everysi -- workplace they find, 
they took -- they took Jews, because as -- as a 
matter of fac t , the -- this is -- this was easy, b
ecause the -- the -- the -- the germ -- Germans took 
Slovakia as a separate entity, and th
e -- in -- in harvest time, there we
re no Slovak workers who used to 
come  for the harvest, because that -- the -- that
 gave the Jews opportunity
 to -- to send their own 
people. 

Q: To do what? 

A: To -- instead of the Slovak, who didn™t come  a ny more because they we re a separate entity, and the 
-- the pl aces that the Slovaks wo
rked in were freed, because -- 
Q: And they needed young people to work? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: Okay. So did you go -- did you leave home then, to work? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: Where -- where did you go, what did you do? 

A: I went to a -- a individual Hashorah, because th
ey were not -- not a group, because there were three 
people in the village. And Mikelorwitsa. 
And all worked with different farmer.  
Q: Did you have any training in
 farm work before this? 
A: No, no, no, no. W- We -- we qu 
-- considered as students. 
Q: So what -- what did you do on the far m? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
25 
 
A: Everything. Ev-Everything. Fir -- 
first it is the harvest time, we wo
r ked in the field, and my -- my 
boss, he loved me . And as a ma tter of fact, as
 a -- a -- a shadchan, you know?  A [indecipherable] 
wo ma n who  -- 
A2: Matchmaker. 

A: Ma-Matchma ker came one day to me  and said ho 
-- I want to arrange this -- the marriage between 
you and that daughter of the -- of th
e far mer. Because -- I said I can™t 
do that, because Jews are not li -- 
not allowed. No, you™ve -- you work, you are not a Jew. 

Q: You work and you™re en
 -- so you™re not a Jew? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What did that mean when she said you -- 

A: Because h-he didn™t consider the 
Je ws who worked in the fields, becau
se  he -- there™s pa -- they™re -
- had -- in their psycholo
gy, work -- people who work, they are not Jews.  
Q: So he assume d Jews were slackers? 
A: What? 
Q: He thought Jews were slackers? 

A: Yes, beca -- Jews were rich. 

Q: Jews were rich? 

A: Yes.  

Q: Oh, okay. So do y -- do you thin
k you changed hearts and mi nds?  
A: No. 

Q: No, it sounds like you did. 

A: Because the m- ma yor of the village was a fascist, 
because  he  -- he was the brother of a general -- of 
a Czech gene ral who fled to England, and he thought
 that™s who he -- he w
ould be well thought of if 
you -- you join those fascists, because the -- this -- because a -- a -- a number of farme r s went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
26 
 
demonstrated a -- a -- against the -- Kukarussia was 
his name, because i-if he was anti-Semite, they 
didn™t want  it, because th-thr
ee Jews are c -- all right.  
Q: So what was the town you were in?  Where -- where was this farm?  

A: What? 

Q: Where was the farm? 

A: In -- not -- in Bohemi a, but i-i-it was close 
to the -- ma -- ma -- to 
my -- to my hometown. 
Q: Did you si -- live on the farm?  

A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: We re there other peop
le with you, other Jews? 
A: Yes. Di -- no, we lived in the -- i-in a house w-w-which was empty, but it was meant for the poor -- 

for the poor of the village. And one
 poor -- one th -- one ma n was leavi
ng to two, not in ours -- in our -
- in our room, because we were three.  

Q: Okay, three -- three of you, and one of you th
e prospective fiancé of the farmer™s daughter. 
A: Yes. 

Q: So what -- now -- 

A: We w -- met her after -- we met her to the sk 
-- communist Zion in -- in Mikelorwitsa, and she 
cried.  

Q: So di -- was the farmer™s
 daughter interested in you? 

A: Yes, yes.  

Q: So you had a little roma nce?  

A: No, no, no.  

Q: So di -- so how did y -- what -- what happenedafter -- after this, when 
the -- you were a -- a -- you 
were approached to ma rry the daughter, and you 
said no, I can™t, cause I™m Jewish. Th-The 
matchmaker says it doesn™t matter. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
27 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Then what? 

A: Because -- fr -- shortly after that, we were
 -- I was caught proo -- pr oo -- Prague, the -- the 
headquarters of the Hehalutz, because they -- they 
thought that the ma yor was n -- was not in favor of 
us. 

Q: So you were moved to Prague? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oh. Then what happened?   

A: Then I was two -- two or thre
e weeks in the course -- course
, and afterwards the He halutz 
move me nt, the leadership was in -- they felt that is -- there™s war, of course, comi ng, and they left.  

Q: Left Prague? 

A: Yes, to Israel -- to Palestine. 

Q: So they emigrated. The leadership. 
A: Yes, yes, yes. Because  they have the certificates. 
Q: What certificat es? Of emigration? 

A: Yes, yes. No, of acceptance in Palest
ine by the British ma ndatory government. 
Q: Did you think of going? 

A: Yes, yes, I thought of it, but I was not -- I t
hought I could have gone, ac
tually, but then I thought 
that my fate was th -- with the Hehalutz move me nt, because I refused to go, yes. 

Q: Why?  

A: I w-wanted to be with that group. 

Q: With theHehalutz? 

A: Yes. With this group that I was working. 

Q: What did you think you could do by staying? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
28 
 
A: Well, not much. Because it is a fa
ct that a -- if you refuse to go -- because my father a-a-arranged 
for me  to get a cerfic -- tuf --  
Q: Certificate. 

A: -- certificate as a stud
ent to Jerusalem, bec -- that I won™t 
go, because I was now a proletarian. Yes, 
sh -- th-that was stupid.  

Q: So the -- and what name  we
re you using now, at this point? 
A: Yeah -- 

Q: Still the name th
at you were born with? 
A: No, Moshe le -- Lemberger.  

Q: Okay, but it wasn™t Moshe, right, it was -- 

A: No, the move me nt called me  Moshe. 

Q: Okay, well ha -- the move me nt called you Moshe? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Was that your c
hoice or theirs? 
A: No, my c hoice. 

Q: Why?  

A: Because tha -- this was my middle name. 

Q: But why give up your first name  for your mi ddle name? 

A: I didn™t give up, because I was Arnosht -- Er ns
t Lemberger on -- on the official papers, but among 
ourself they called me  M oshe. 

Q: How did that start? 

A: Everybody used her mi ddle na me. 

Q: Okay. Was that to be more je
w -- more bonded in your Jewishness? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
29 
 
A: Yes, yes, yes. Because  I was afterwards col 
-- I became a me mber of the Hehalutz leadership, 
because they -- they -- they frunthe
 -- function of this left because 
they took every Zionist moveme nt, 
but took -- they ma de you hanhalla. 
A2: Directorship. 

A: Yu -- ri -- director ship. I was 
one of them, exc e pt I was never a re
gis -- registered stylist, because 
they took me  -- I-I was o-on a Jewish school, and my
 father was a -- a -- was a Zionist because they 
took me  in. 

Q: What in you -- I mean, given -- I mean your father
 was a Zionist, you weren™t.
 You weren™t related -
- raised in a very
 religious household. 
A: No. 

Q: What happened in you to ma ke you wa
nt to be a leader in that move ment? 
A: Well, they asked me, because I was a -- a Zion
ist always, always, because that was the good move 
for me , I thought, because I was immediately the -- the 
--they made me director
 of the bake -- Beit 
Hehalutz, because th-that™s was a ho-home  fo
r workers, because th -- the -- I go -- 
Q: Want a break? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. [tape break] Okay, so we
™re on you™ve become  the leader. 
A: I was the rev -- dov -- rest -- dire
ctor of the Beit Karlot seim becau
se this is h-h-ha -- hostile for 
Karlotseim, you -- who did find work, because -- andthey were waiting for certificates, and all me ans 

of illegal transport sessions to Palestine. Not -- not one of them went. 

Q: Okay, hang on, there™s some thing now funky w
ith the mi crophone. Okay, they were waiting but 
none of them went? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Why not?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
30 
 
A: But -- because I found out that 
the ce-ce-certificate of going to Palest ine were sold to Jews for 
money, because -- including non-Zionists. 
Q: Who sold them?  

A: That Palestine office, because i-
i -- the head of the ch
i -- pi -- tels -- Palestine office w-was Mr. 
Jakov Edelstein. He s-sold them. But -- 

Q: So Jews were exploiting other Jews? 

A: Yes, because they -- they need
ed the money, because w-why give ce
rtificates to -- to poor people, 
prolet arian, if they can get a lot of money for this -- for this certifi -- certificates. 

Q: So you were stuck with a bunch of proletariat? 

A: Yes. I believed in that, because we -- we went-- w-we wanted to go to dol -- the real kibbutzim i n 

Israel, and that was proletarian culture. 

Q: But you couldn™t if you di
dn™t have a certificate. 
A: Yes, because we waited.  
Q: So what did you do? 
A: We ll, I got disappointed very ear
ly, and that -- and then I -- I 
-- at the beginning, I published two 
pa-papers called Allez Immigrants, because up to then
 I was told I could not publish it because this 
allsbare illegal pub -- publications
, that the Jewish community did 
not allow that. But that was a 
disappointment, but I c-continued my
 work. But then I -- I published 
later, I don™t know the date, a -- a 
-- a -- that™s was all -- oh yeah th-that -- then I -- th
ere™s -- took this Beit Karlot seim and turned it into a 
social affairs -- 

Q: Committee?  

A: Yes -- no. 

Q: Organization? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
31 
 
A: Yes, because -- and I organized 
a group of members of the Beit Karlot
seim to protest against this -- 
against -- I can™t sa -- 
Q: Against the change, you mean? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay, so help me  understand. So he
re you™re th-the -- the leader, right? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Of the young Zionist organi
zation, of the Hehalutz. 
A: Yes. 

Q: You pissed off the people in Prague, right?  They™re ma d at you, the other Jews? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So they say, okay, you can™t do that any 
more, now you™re a social organization? 

A2: No. 

A: Yeah. What? 
Q: No?  
A2: They wanted to declare them as social cases. 

A: No, no, no, no. 

A2: We ll, see, that™s what
 you wrote in the paper. 
A: Because the -- there has -- the be -- Je
wish community had a social departme nt. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that -- there was a number of
 organizations, social -- social or
ganizations, Beit Karlotseim was 
separate because there wa s a sepa
rate o-organization, not -- not --  
Q: Okay.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
32 
 
A: And the -- the organiz -- the soci
al services departme nt turned th
e Beit Karlotseim into a soci al 
organization. And this I acs -- saw it, but th
is was a move to young people to prepare the 
transpor tations w-when -- if c-comes. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You s -- okay, I™m sorry. 

A: And organized the young people 
of -- who lived in the Beit 
Karlotseim, to -- they must 
[indecipherable] against this move. And 
they didn™t appreciat
e it at all.  
Q: So the young people didn™t go along with you? 

A: No -- yes, is -- 

Q: They did. 

A: They didn™t go -- because the head of the social 
bi -- departme nt, Dr. Katz 
didn™t even talk to them. 
Q: So the so-called adul ts -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- just ma de a decision that
 you felt put the youth in peril? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And you fought against that? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And you got all the youth to go along with you? 

A: Yes. Because then I was a -- then I was a -- a -- 
I was no longer head of the hek -- Beit Karlotseim, 
because I was sus -- suspect, because I said -- an
d that was actually what happened. The young people 
were sent to a -- a -- a -- a -- a camp 
in -- in Bohemi a to -- to prepare th
e --  the --  the future ghetto in 
Terezín, because that time, Jewish co
mmunity got the idea that -- that  Te
rezín is the future of the Jews, 
a-and why at that time already two transportations 
went to -- to Lódz, because -- and that™s -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
33 
 
Jewish community -- I™d believe so, 
they -- they -- they believed that
 was at -- a -- a solution for the 
Jewish problem in -- in ber -- bets
 -- ter -- te -- ter -- [indeci pherable
] Berman and Me lber -- Bohemi a 
and Moravia, because they would save
 the Czech Jews from being sent  abroad to -- if -- ist -- it™s 
proved to be death camp. But they a -- the Jewish 
community believed in that. I didn™t. And -- and th-
the youth repaired th -- Terezín as
 the ghetto. They were -- th-they we
re -- we -- s -- were strong. And 
youth, be -- I -- and young people, and dup -- keek -- th
ey did prepare it. And when the ghetto came  
into being, I -- the -- the 
-- I can™t. I can™t.  
Q: When -- when the ghetto came  into being, did you 
feel vindicated in any way?  Did you feel like, 
look, I -- I pointed this out to you, that this was a problem here? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. And how in -- how long -- 

A2: The directorship. 

A: The directorship of the ghetto was almost
 hundred percent Zionist, because that was Jankov 
Edelstein™s work, because he -- 
he believed in that, I think.  
Q: And whe r e was the rest of your family during th
is time ?  Where was your mother, and father, and

 -- we were your -- your history of getting kicked 
out of the Hehalutz -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- I think is where we left off.  
A: I was kicked out because I was -- I was living 
with a friend of mi ne 
who has a A-Aryan wife. 
He -- h-h-he was from Berlin, and h-h-he had the en -- apartment on -- he took me  i -- to live 

with him, because I was a friend of his. And a 
-- and I lived there, and I worked with him o -- 

whatever we f-found. Snow -- so we got in the snow
 business, and a-all kinds of business. But I -
- once we were sitting at dinner, and the father 
of the -- of Mrs. We isner w-w-was with us. He 
came from Berlin. And suddenly the -- the Gesta
po ma n ad -- came in, and he didn™t react. He 
was -- because he was -- he had his ha t on because
 it -- suddenly there™s Mr. Davis, that was the 

blo -- the father-in-law of Mr. We

swered, and it -- he™s of -- was a high official

of the German arm -- defense departme nt. And i n th
e end he said all right, 
he want -- h-he want -
- he -- he was i-i-insisted, that Gestapo ma n, that
 I-I couldn™t live with
 an Aryan wo-woman, and 
I went back to the -- to the Beit Karlotseim. 
Q: They took you back? 

A: Yes, yes. I -- well, they had to take him back
 -- back. I -- I -- I didn™t ha
ve any difficulty in --

Q: When you say there was 
room, was this a group home ? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. Because Beit Hollitset, th

beds, not the bunks. 

Q: So how ma ny peopl e to a room? How was this? 

A: Oh well, here -- 50. 

Q: Oh my gosh.  

A: But -- beca -- I -- when I was 
director, I was the only direct
or of this Beit Harthound who 
lived there, because I couldn™t lived

no, no, not a commune, because people who waited f-
for certificates of -- for a tr
ansfer pa tient 
to I-I-Israel. 
Q: How long would people wait ther
e?  How long would they stay? 
A: Till they went to Terezín, because these people had -- were -- and ha -- these people were -- 

were -- these people were there because they waited
 for it, because they -- they waited in vain, 
because -- and now na -- a number 
of them from Polska Paskavuz,

part of Czechoslovakia wh-who -- wh
ich was ceded to -- to bi -- ya

Ukraine. And they had certificates which could 
ma ke the m go there, becau
se they s- sold their 
certificates and -- and -- to other people, who 
could pay, and among them were a number of Jews 
who were a-anti-Zionists. I found that out. 
Q: But it was a way to ge t out. 

A: Yes, yes, beca -- it -- other Jews -- 

Q: So in this -- in the Hehalutz gr oup home, were there families -- 

A: No, no, no, because they were all bachelor s, 
and there was and -- different -- a different home 

for halut -- ha luktor t, because wome n, which 
were only a few, because the wome n didn™t get 
certificates because -- I don™t -- everyone that got 
a certificate got ma rried
 because in -- that™s 
for mally ma rried because  they -- they -- ever
ybody here had a -- a certificate, coul d br ing his

A: We ll, I -- I-I -- there was no hope of e migrated 
through Israel, there was no hope, so I went to 
the -- to the direct orat e of -- to 
the -- and I had a-an idea, because 
it was autumn, the end i -- they 
want me n, but they di dn™t want women because I su
 -- I suggested to the Hanhalla that the -- the 
dir-directorate -- because they would [indecipherabl

to take -- take our

girlfriends without -- without th
eir having work, because they agr
eed to do it, there was the only 
Haktarah because they to -- they agreed to th
is, because I found the three -- three comr ades who 
had ra -- wome n, because one was married, one. A

and this was -- this was --  i-it was very nice.

A: Ah, because that was a farming estate. A-As 
a matter of fact, the owner was a German Nazi, 
ol-old Nazi, he had three far ming stake in the

own -- th-the owner of the three places. He was 
very nice, because I spoke ger -- German, and I -
- I spoke to him on -- what -- whichever way neede
d, and he -- he -- he told me , I would have a 
son-in-law that did like you [ind

eastern front. He was -- was very, very nice.  

Q: And how long were you at the farm?   

A: Few mo n t hs. 
Q: Mm. 
A: Because I was determined to go underground, 
and in the vicinity was a-anothe r group of 

people who were fr -- sent by the Hashomer Hatzai

group. And I -- w-we -- I talked to him and they pr
omised to help us, or this -- or the -- or the 
comr ades that were in that -- 
i-in our group, and I wi -- I-I --
 they had connections to the 
communist underground, and they would help us. 

Q: Now how did you communicate w
ith the other groups?  Weren™t

far m?  You were allowed to get out, have a social life?

44 
 
Q: Okay, for three weeks, and then you move again? 
A: No, no, because I wa -- I do not quite reme mb er
 how long we stayed, because then I -- and a -
- in that time, I met -- I was with Weisner, wi
th our friends, and I work

because i -- we worked for the German army,

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491

Q: All the same  for you? 
A: Yes. 

Q: All the same. 

A: And then we got into contact with the Hashom
er Hatzair, and -- and they told us that I got 
legalized, because in -- in the ma yor
 of a -- of a little village, he 
was say that w-we actually were 
f -- were from there, because he didn™t have to
 do anything, because he -- h -- I-I -- the police 
asked them if -- if it™s was all right, bec -- because
 he -- he  didn™t have anything to do, because if 
it is -- a citizen was not k
nown, he would have to report it because if
 he ni -- if all -- all right, that 
is all. Because enter that, and in --in this wa
y we were legalized. But I wanted [indecipherable] 
as I lived a-as a Jew, I met a man called Vasl av
 Limberski, and because he was -- he -- I don™t 
know, he was a driver of a -- of a lorry -- o-o-of
 a -- no -- n-n-not a -- no, lorry i-is a Br itish -- 
Q: Truck. 

A: It™s truck, yes. Because Weisner was a geni
us businessman, and he go-got his dr iver with a 
trunk to -- to take our work to 
the Germans. And I -- he was fro
m Vishnova, and h-he was in -- o 
-- in Bohemi a as a [indecipherabl e] because he wa s in Germany, and -- and -- and I reme mbered 
the -- the -- the name, because I -- Limbersky a
nd Lemberge r was pretty close, and so I -- I 
registered in the police as Arnost, which was my
 name, Boha mi re -- it is Limbersky. And I wa -- 
registers my wife a -- Maria Novakava, sh-she -- 
sh -- I paid one woma n to give me  h-her birthd 

-- birthd -- certificate. We ll, so we we re legal. 
I don™t know -- I -- my wife , that is number one -- 
Q: Out of three? 

A: Yes. She never worked. She -- because the -- 
the man who -- I never met him, who got to be 
the -- the mayor of the city, told 
me I ne -- I -- you know German, it ge

Q: Tape two B, U.S. Hol ocaust Memorial Museum, Nove mb er 13
th
, 2004, continuation of the 
interview with Moshe Leshem. This is Karen Michelle and here we go.  
A: Well, I -- I -- I applied the -- th
e -- to this institute, and I 
was accepted, because they had few 
people who could teach German. An
d he was -- before the wa r, this was a Jewish institute, 
because -- and the director was a German, who used 
to be a German teacher at the same institute, 
Dr. Powell, very nice man, too. He ge -- he hi
red a nu-number of Germa ns Yiddish sol-soldeeps 
because they had Jewish wife, and they had -- th
ey™re ha lf Jews, and he knew about it. And after 
a time, the Gestapo g -- ordered him to -- to get a
ll the Jewish -- all the half
 Jews or -- and -- and 
who -- and who m- mi ss -- mi ss them.And then after -- in that period, he called me  a nd said to 

me, ﬁListen, the -- the -- the peopl
e t-tell me  that you are also 
half-Jewish, a-and what is the 
matter?ﬂ And I told him,  if a man has  a bit 
of shekel -- and I use the word shekel, you 
imme diately think h-he -- he is a half Jew. You know
, he -- I said, it is n --
 I think he t-took a -- a 
document out of this drawer, and 
I signed a letter, not a Jew, not 
a Pole, and not a gypsy, I signed 
it. And wa -- wa -- 
Q: Very clever. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: As it were, yeah, yeah. 

A: Because a je -- a -- Germans in -- in s -- th
e Sudetenland, they were used to Yiddish words 
because there were -- were J-Jews there, too, 
be cause he was employed by a Jew, and he took 
this as a -- a -- a -- the -- the word shekel, took 
this it is all right, because you -- this was a -- a 
word, the Germans knew this. And afterward I send 
a -- a yurnafarka and -- and -- and then who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
47 
 
are -- who -- I met a -- as a Jew, I met one Czec
h, and -- and by the name  of Lahrer, and I -- and 
he ex -- he thought hi-his summonsed to this yu
rnafarka and he went to Germany as a friend 
[indecipherable]. And he was in Breslau, and he wa
s at b -- at the reichsbard, because he was the 
red -- the -- at the state railway 
station, and he got in uniform w
ith a hakkencrosse in his coat 
[indecipherable] a-a-and he was -- 
he was a -- a -- all right. And he 
came, and the ger -- he wa -- 
had a right to come  home, of course, a-after a cer
tain time. And he w-was -- h-he -- I told him go 
to Vishnova, and -- and a -- I went through -- with 
him, a-and with -- we we nt to the ceme tery 
and took the name  Li-Limbersky, and it so happened 
that these were his parents, who were dead. 
I knew that, because th-the -- the -- the truck dr iv
er told me his parents were dead, and I gave 
him 5,000 kroner and I told him if a -- I told him,  
as he wrote out the documents, I t -- told him 
to give a thousand kroner gift, th
at™s was an important sum. And 
he didn™t have change, because 
he -- the Roma n Catholic priest went to the -- to
 the pub, to trans-change -- exchange it. And I 
told him to k -- a few documents e mpty and s -- stamped them. 
Q: So while the priest was out getting change -- 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 

Q: You took the documents and stamped them. 

A: No, no. Yura Farkat, I was not there.

Q: Stamped these documents. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491

Q: And the priest then never knew. 
A: No. Because it ha -- I -- at that
 time, I went -- I -- I ki  -- I 
got a -- I si -- forged documents, 

because I had a friend, Eny Crew, who came to 
the house, and h-he -- he  u -- forged lino -- 
linoleum. He -- he was very clever. He forged 
the stamp of t he police di

Q: May I see them? 

A: No, no, no, no, because th -- th -- the ha -- copi es, yes. 

Q: Mm. I™d love to them. 

A: Yes, yes. And that -- I -- I 
-- that was all right. And I -- in 
the -- and th-that I took a fr -- a 
number of people who went to Germany, because 
I wa -- have the friend 
-- a -- a -- a friend, a 
Czech s -- who was i-i-in the labor exchange, and 
he was -- he sent Czech citizens to Germany. 
Of course they didn™t want to go. Acts -- acts -- 
that is -- it is not dange
rous, cause there were -- 
they™re -- were free, because th-they™re were no
t sl-slaves, because yeah, they -- they lived in 
camps, and they didn™t have any right to speak to
 Germans, and -- and that -- and then there was 
a bombing it takes, o-of course, not ma ny were
 s -- to gentle Germany, it was a c-cat -- 
catastrophe for the Czechs. But of 
course, I had to -- I was -- spoke 
to that ma n, and he told me  
that it -- it -- a fantastic idea. The -- the Je
ws will -- will pay 5,000 [indecipherable] and I -- 
Czech also -- what™s 5,000 kroner, I -- that™s -- it
™s [indecipherable], and I™ve -- and I -- and I-I 
had three or four me n who went 
and I can -- I can it -- I coul dn
™t find any other to exchanged, 
because the Jews were afraid, were afraid.

Q: Now how did you separate your life out, the 
people who wi -- knew you were Jewish, and the 
people who thought you wouldn™t --
 you weren™t?  Did you behave 
in a certain way to -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- some  people, and a different way to others? 

A: Yeah, no, I -- the -- the Jews
 -- I -- w-were people who knew me , not -- not strangers.  
Q: Okay. 

A: Because a -- and -- a -- among the Jews, the 
Jewish women whom I -- whom I wanted to 
exchanged was a Stella Kurswalawa -- Lebolawa, 
because he -- I was -- I met her after w-war in 
Israel, and he  told me  you will, of course, write,
 because he was with my  mother in Auschwitz, 

and h-he was g-gassed, because that
™s was the last transportations 
wode -- wi -- which went to 
the gas chambers, yes. And that
 -- we -- wis -- was in ™44.  
Q: Very late. 

A: Yes. And -- and that is -- th
-that™s was a -- a -- in -- I couldn™t deliver  Jews, I couldn™t, 
because they were afraid. And i-in addition to 
this, I forged a lot of doc -- documents who I 
didn™t know. I -- cause tha -- that w-was a Czech
 friend, Eleanor Gevishava, who was a -- a -- 
increbil -- increbit --  incredible -- i-if -- she 
was a -- she wa-was a -- a -- one of the few Czechs 
who was name d a righteous -- a Righteous Gentile 
[indecipherable] the na tions. I™ve also -- also 
one of the sponsors, and sh-she came one day and asked me  -- asked me  show the documents, the 

I.D. cards fr-from -- o-off a Jew from -- or a 
Czech Jew who e-escaped from Poland and Russian 
soldier. I think he -- he was a 
-- a -- a lieut enant who was cate -- ca
me  fr om the prisoners of war 
c-camp, and he -- I -- he wanted me to meet with
, I refused because wi -- all the time Eleanor 
didn™t know my real name, because
 I told her my name was Kaliw
ater, because I knew that the 
communist underground force, there we
re n-Nazi spies in there, and 
they told me  that the-they -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491

they ha -- they witness enough destructions of 
Jews, I™m -- I think it™s was a -- w-was a -- that 
just the first mass destructions 
of Jewish -- Jews in Poland. I forget the name . I can look it up. 
Q: Okay, all right. 
A: What? 

Q: Amazing.  

A: Treblinka -- Treblinka. I think it was Treblinka
, and she asked me  to speak to the Jewish 
community and tell him -- them, about it. And I got 
a -- a -- a -- the woman I to -- I wa nt to send 
to Germany, you -- the -- the mi stress of Rick
art Israel Fr iedman, who was the -- he was the 
Viennese Jew, because when Gestapo send to pr
o -- P-Pr ague, because he -- there was a -- an 

understanding. He was the -- the Gestapo ma n beca -- 
he -- he  was not a traitor. Of course, the -- 
the -- Greece considered [indecipherable] a tra
itor, because  h-he was -- he was a go-between. 
And -- and I told him this story, and a few weeks afte
r --  after I told this St ella, and he -- he told 
me  that I -- I shouldn™t panic the Jews, and he ma
de a hint that he know
s where I was living, and 
I -- I knew that ri -- Friedman must have known this
 thing a-all the time . A
nd wi -- and after -- a 
few weeks afterward, the two were shot, because
 -- how one man, a Czech shot two German 
guards, cause he mi ssed them. And a  -- he was a 
-- a -- he was a -- a -- a -- a agent of the 
Gestapo, and she -- he threw away a briefcase, a
nd there was all the -- all the me mber  of his 
group, and I was not among them. Of course, maybe
 I was Kaliwater, because he didn™t -- didn™t 
know -- know my na me. And -- and all 
the -- all the me mber s of this
 group were arrested, and ol 
-- only one came  back. Because he -- everybody wa
s kept alive three mo nths, because they 
tortured him, and they -- they 
got a -- to -- they -- they wanted
 to tell them more about that 
school. This guy was three months -- was -- was kept
 three months, a-a-and he was late, he was 
arrest ed late, because he -- i-i-in the meanti
me , the war was over, he -- he  came back. And

Eleanor was also arrested, because he  was not on
 the list. All -- they found a book with her name  
in it, and he was arrested. 
Q: She was. 

A: She was arrest ed i -- on the -- as a consequen
ce of this book name . A
nd he -- she ta -- told 
them this i -- I -- I lost the book, because I -- 
I don™t know how -- who got 
hold of it, and she wer 
-- was freed. And she -- sh-she was -- sh -- and 
she telephoned me , and -- and -- at the language 

institute. I -- 

Q: Where you were teaching Germa n? 

A: No, no, I don™t know, because he 
-- he never knew my na me .

r wife didn™t know your name ?

A: Eleanor, becau -- I -- no --

 I -- I don™t know how -- I don™t know how -- 

how he got it to touch with me , neither before 
and afterward, but she got 
it -- in touch with me, 
and I continued to -- to deliver documents, and I 
reme mber that I have two blank paper of the 
S.S. hauptkrotere, because that -- that was the gene
rous stuff. And I gave her one -- I gave her a 
dogod -- do -- go -- document that™s this -- th-there is
 no objections that this
 -- this ma n can go to 
his visits and h-he -- he lived 
with this docu -- docume nt.  
Q: Now this ma y seem like a strange question, but 
I™m curious about this. It
 seems that people -- 
well, not -- it seems like people obviously had to lie
 and be  deceitful, and 
keep track of all of 
these different forms of truth -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
52 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- all the time. Did 
you practice doing that? 
A: No. No.

A: No, I -- I™m not a good actor, because we me t We
isner and I -- I must tell -- tell you that I got 
a -- a I.D. card from Weisner too, because fr 
-- he was called [indeciphe
rable] and h-he was a 
genius because he -- he  went to Germany and in
 -- in no time he was a millionaire. He -- and he 
came back to Czechoslovak -- to [indecipherable] pr
otectorate, as -- as a dosta, because he wa -- 
has the wife was living in Prague. 
And he -- h-he was fantastic. I -- 
and -- am in contact with his 
son in Hamb urg. A-And he died 45 years old, a -- 
a heart attack. And w-w-we talked freely, but 
not to the people outside.

stop working for the underground, di

get out of here myself? 
A: Who?  
Q: You. Wh en did you finally say, time  for me  to go? 

A: Oh, there cus -- there came a -- 
a period in Czechoslovakia, after 
war, who let all the Jews out 
of Czechoslovakia. [indecipherable] i-i-it™s a 
-- was the -- the anti-Sem

at this time ?  Numb er one? 
A: It was with me .

at I will di vorce her the 
moment th -- the war 
would end, I -- I -- yes, she didn™t believe me . I --
 I -- I -- I took the blame on me, because -- and 
th -- the -- the judge, after he di
vorced me , on my  fault, he told me
 to come to his chambers, and 
I came there, and he says -- says -- she said, 
ﬁI wou -- you had the witn
esses against you, but I 
warned you not do that any more, because othe
rwise I would not divorce you f -- f -- in your 

fault.ﬂ Is -- he -- he knew.

 Karen Michelle, and we keep going with the 
story. Okay, so we™re into going -- why did you just -- why did you want to go to Israel? 

A: I was a Zionist. 

Q: Yeah, but I thought you wou -- had 
conflicted feelings about Zionism? 
A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: No. Because th -- I was -- I -- I guessed that 
the Communists would be not
 a -- a -- a -- not for 
justice, and -- and yi -- I guessed that the commun
ist party would be subject from -- to Russia, 
and that -- it was a -- as -- a -- 
a terrible regi me, and that made me go to Israel, because my wife 
w-was tr -- tref -- pressing me  to go to Israel
. I -- I have a daughter 
in Israel. Today is her 
birthday, 58 years.  
Q: When you went to Israel, what did you expect? 
A: Expect?  

Q: Mm-hm. You reme mber that -- first, 
do you reme mber the date that you arrived? 
A: In the -- May, ™49. And I had friends there who he
lped me  get it -- th --  in the -- the foreign s-
service, because I -- i-in Czechoslovakia, I had 
Israelis who went to Cz
echoslovakia in -- in my 
official capacity and I got to -- to meet and then 
t -- the Israeli mi nister, because in this -- that™s 

was not an ambassador [indecipherable] because the 
-- i-i-in -- medium states had mi nisters o -- 
and because this was Ahoud and Abriel, and 
we were ver -- we 
got very friendly.  
Q: So you were then ma de an ambassador? 

A: No, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
61 
 
Q: You were in the foreign service? 
A: Yes.  

Q: And wha t  did that mean at the time? 

A: Foreign service? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I -- I was an official of the foreign mi nistry. 

Q: So what did you do?  Where did you live, what did you do? 

A: An -- and the -- the fi rst job I had was in 
the re-research departme nt. Then I was a -- a 
temporary spokesman, a nd then I went to Burm
a as a first secretary to -- th-that was an 
ambassador Harkoim. And -- 

Q: S -- sorry. 

A: That I was ma rried to this Anetha . 

Q: Whew, okay. So -- so you™re -- you™re in 
this -- where were you living when you came to 
Israel? 

A: What? 

Q: Where were you living at first? 

A: Cholon. 

Q: Did you feel a sense of relief at finally getti
ng there?  Did you -- did you feel that you were 
home , how did you feel? 

A: Yes, yes, I w-was home. I felt I w-was home .  

Q: What was the feeling of -- a-and whatname  did you use then, when you were home?  

A: Limbersky, because I changed my name to Leshem. 

Q: When did you change it to Leshem?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
62 
 
A: I don™t know, beca -- very soon, very soon. 
Q: After you got to Israel, you cha -- 

A: What? 

Q: Soon after you got to Israel you changed it? 

A: No, because I-I was in the foreign office a-at that time . All the o-officials of the foreign office 

had to change their name . 

Q: Why?  

A: Yes, because that was an order. 

Q: No matter what your name 
was, you had to change it? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Then how did you decide what name  to take? 

A: I looked i-in the dictionary, a-and I found Leshem
. Because i-it -- that no longer exists, this 
word, no longer. 
Q: You looked in the dictionary and 
does le -- what does Leshem mean? 
A: I -- that™s the -- the high priest  had 12 stones,
 each one for one -- for one tribe, and Leshem 
was the tribe of [indecipherable] done. 
Q: Okay. 

A: Because it is not clear what
 Leshem was, because Leshem is this -- I don™t -- nobody knows 
what it was. 

Q: So you could have been -- a-and then your fi
rst name , how did you decide that Moshe would 
be your first name ?  

A: Because if -- it was Moshe, because I -- I reme
mber I told you that my name was Ernst Moshe 
-- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
63 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- Lemberger. 

Q: Yeah, so you took your mi ddle name  as your first name . 

A: Yes, yes. Yes. Because that was my Hebrew name . 

Q: Right, of course. So you could have 
been Moshe Maccabee instead for all -- 

A: Yes, yes. I could have.  

Q: So when you became Moshe Leshem, did you feel
 in any way symbolically that you were a 
new person? 

A: Yes. Oh -- oh -- old new persons.  

Q: Not too old. 

A: Not too old. 

Q: Pretty young, actually. 

A: [indecipherable] was ™
49 -- ‚18. I was born in ™18. 
Q: Mm-hm. So 31. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Pretty young. 

A: Yes. Today I thi
nk it is pretty young.  
Q: So as this new person, what did you feel that
 you could do as this -- as
 a new person at -- of 
31 years old in this new country? 

A: Well, I was in the foreign mi nistry, 
because I -- th-thi s was my profession.  
Q: You had no real profession, you had been so 
ma ny things just to -- 
to be, to survive. 
A: Yeah, well, because the foreign office was a very good position. 

Q: Yeah. Did your wife work? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0491  
64 
 
A: Yes, yes. My second wife w-was o-
of -- worked as an
 English teacher. 
Q: Did she ch -- and she changed her name  also? 
A: What? 

Q: She changed her name  also? 

A: Yes, yes, yes.  

Q: Wow. I can™t imagine what that would feel li
ke, to take on a whole 
new fi nal identity, after 
you™ve taken so ma ny name s just to -- to su
rvive. And then you finally said this is 
[indecipherable] 

A: I am basically the same  person. Th
e name is not -- i-is not important. 
Q: Did you -- when you got to Israel, did 
that affect your faith in any way? 
A: Face? 

Q: Your faith, your -- your spiritual beliefs. 

A: No. I am -- well, I am -- am a Jew, eth -- ethni
cally. I™m not a religious 
Jew. I have fre -- freep 
-- freep -- pretended to be as
 -- as an ambassador, but -- 
Q: So what -- see -- so you were still pretending. 

A: Yes. No.  

Q: I mean then, you -- you -- you kept 
pretending before you got to Israel. 
A: No, because the -- why ask [indecipherable] 
has said that y-y-you are Jewish, I thought, no, I 
am a Jew. I™m not -- not -- not Jewish. 

Q: Then why do you wear the chai? 

A: That is -- I sa -- has this 40 y
ears, because it -- chai means l-life.  
Q: So you -- you™re an ambassador

the Jewish community -- the secretary of the 
Jewish community told me  that I should not invite him. 

Q: You™re kidding. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Why would he say that, or she? 

A: Because -- h-he -- because th
is was a segregated society. 
Q: And even Jews -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- followed that? 

A: No, because he was afraid that the whites -- 
the -- the w-w -- the whites would take offense if 
I invited Martin Luther Ki
ng. But I wanted to, but -- 
Q: Little bit ironic, no? 

A: Yes -- no, no. Because this is very complicated, 
the -- the relationshi p there, because the -- the 

-- the rabbi of the temple roths 
-- Rothschild was -- was against segregation because he also had 
to be careful.
