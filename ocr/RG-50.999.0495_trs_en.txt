>> Bill Benson: T he reason I mention isbecause they had
 
been in thefam ily for hundredsof  
years.  Right?
 
>> David Bayer:  Yeah.  W e haddishes which every 
P
assover, Jewish people would take 
special dishesfor the holiday
 a
ndevery year, takeout the dishes and use it. Butthe Germans 
took everything.  T he di
shes were ona shelf  in the warehouse. T hey knocked itdown and 
broke practically ever ything. W hatever was not broken,they took it. Silver, they took away
. 
E
ver ything that was silver they took away.
 
 
T hen the Germans took m e, took m e out to work f or th
em.  Andthey m adem e take 
out
 
--
 
I was only 16
 
1/2 years old.  Ididn't know how to take abattery out of a truck. W e didn't 
have m any trucks in our town.  It was cold. T here was still snow on the ground. T hey gave 

m ea pair of pliers.  I didn't know how to take this battery f rom  underneath outandput in anew 

one.  I was bleeding. T he acid burnedm y clothing. T hey were laughing, the Germ ans were 

standing there with their cam erasand taking pictures and laughing. I was crying.  T hey we re 

laughing. 
 
Finally I took thebattery out but I burnedm y clothingf rom theacid. They didn't let 
m e gohom eto change m y clothes.  Ididn't livef ar away, m aybe two blocks away.  My m other 

was hom e crying.  Finally I cam ehom e in the evening. T hey didn't gi ve m en
o food, no 

nothing. 
 
 
Another day they came in, they took m yf ather. T hey made him  work in ditches.  
Andm y m other was crying.  T ried tohelphim.  So I tried toexchange m yself form y father. 

But theGermans,they would takem e, too, if I approached them . So Im otioned to m y father 

he should sneak away and I took hisplace. My m other was happy thathe came home.
 
 
W ehad to stand in line, in abakery waiting f or food.  I stood therefor a while.  The 
Germ ans cam e in andtook everybody a way f rom  the l
ine and locked us up.  T hey locked us 
up inthe church across f romm y house.  Hundreds andhundreds of people were locked up in 

the church. My m other didn't know what happened to me.  My brother, little brother, cam eout 

f rom our house.  Itried tom otion,f rom the garden,f rom the church that I am  here. So thiswa y 

m y m otherf ind out I was locked up in the church.
  
T hen they tookme away to another town.  
Locked usup in a camp
,  
am ilitary cam p. T here were soldiers. T his were all kinds of people 
lo cke d  
up,Polish, soldiers, civilians.
 
 
My sister, when she was 19, she went to Radom , tothat town, andbribed the guard 
with m oney and gotme out.  I cam ehom e ina horse and buggy.  T he Germ ans were laughing 

because inthe buggy there was about10, 15people
 
andone horse. The Germ ans were 
workin g on the highway and they were laughi ng andtaking picturesof  the Jews in a wagon 

with one horse and10people. They felt sorry for the horse butnotfor us. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  At what pointdid you getforced to move intoa ghetto?
 
>> David Bayer:  They lived in our housem aybe af ew m onths.  Idon't rememberhow m any 

m onths. Put the Star of David on our door. The neighborhood we lived was a Christian area
; 

a
cro ssf rom  a  ch u rch
, 
in anice neighborhood.  So we had tom ove outf rom  our house, a 
b
i g 
house we had.  
 
 
W egotone room  inthe neighborhood whereall Jewish people were concentrated 
andm adea ghetto.They locked itup with barbed wire. W e couldn't take no furniture, 

m erchandise, nothing. W ehid in the garden,in the ground, in thebasem ent, we hid afew 

things.  Some leatherwe hid, some shoesf rom m y father'sf actory
, s
ome silver ware thatwe 
had, but notm uch. T he rest we lef tand gave it to thepeople who worked 
for m y f ather, 
Christian people.

T hen we moved into one room  in the ghettoandthat's it. I had to sleepon thef loor 
because there wasn'tm uch spacefor beds,only one bed. W e were hungry all the 
t im e.  T he r e  
was a ration. But the ration was not enoughfor the wholefam ily.  And also m y grandf ather 

and grandmother, m yuncle andhis wif e,there was no space.
  
 
 
I used to sneak outf rom  the ghettounder the barbed wire and riskm y lif e. Went to 
ge t
 
food.  A lotof  tim es I had to escape and hide. One day I sneaked outf rom under the 
barbed wire and then I went to getfood.  Shem ade a pum pkin soup, f rom pumpkin.  Shehad 

a bucketfor me. I was taking the pumpkin soup home.
  
On the way back I seetw
o  lit t le  girl s ,  
m aybe 6, 5 years old, twin sisters, two little gi r ls cam e out of the same hole I sneakedout, no 

shoes, cold, hungry, walking over to the dump.  Everybody put trash in itbecause we couldn't 

tie  it a wa y. 
 
A German, I knew him .  He wentover
 
to them and shotboth kids inthe head with 
thatpistol, shot them .  I saw thatand I started running
 w
ith thepum pkin soup because it was 
like gold.  And I sneaked back to the ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint, of course, the Germ ans cam e in and they liquidated the ghetto 

and sent most of the people there, including your f am ily, to their deaths.  How did you survi ve 

that? 
 
>> David Bayer:  Everybody in the ghetto had to work.  Every able
-
body had to work f or the 
Germ ans. Sobefore the war, there was
 
a project notfarf rom  m y hom etown. T here was a 
ri ver thatalwa ys overf lows.  T he Polish gover nm ent were irrigating the area. Sothe German
s 

continuedtodo that sam e job but with slave labor, Jews.  400, about 500 Jewish young m en, 

and older m en, too, 
older m en intheir 40s had to dig the canal and work.  I went to work there.  

T hey gave m e ration, bread.
 
 
In the beginning we we nt to work in them orning, came back in theevening.  The 
Germ ans were evicting the ghetto, sothey lef t us near the canaland hadus working near the 

canaldigging the ditches with a shovel.  Nom achine,nothing.  Digging the canal.
  
I n t he  
m eantim e,the Germ ans were liquidating the ghetto and taking everybody. T hey were sending 

people to T reblinka.
 
 
W hen I was working on the canal, I would sneak away practically ever y day f rom the 
canaland wentto thevillage and beggedf orfoodf rom  thefarm ers. Som etim es I was stealing 

in thef ieldthe potatoes.  One day when I was com ing back to the canal,there was nobody 

there left inthe
 
canal,only the wheel barrels andthe shovels.  I didn't know what happened to 
ever ybody work ing there. The Germ ans came with trucks and tookever ybody away.  Af arm er 

toldm e they took them away.  So I was left alone.  Ididn't know where to go. 
 
 
I  wa s
 
going to a man'shouse in the village.  Told the whole story what happened.  
T hought if they don'tf ind m e,they won't kill m e.  He hidm e in thebarnfor a while.  And then 

he decided
 
--
 
hetoldme there's people in town, lef t som epeople in town.  So he
 
to o k  m e t o 
town, tom y hometown.  T here was about 40,50 people lef t. T he Germ an left them  to clean up 

th e  city, t
he possessions out of the homesf rom  the Jewish people had. Thefarmer took me.  I 

jum ped in under thebarbed wire.
 
 
T hey tookm e in.  I was working with them  together to clean up thehouses.  Notf or 
a long time.  Justm aybe a week or two. T hen the Germ ans took us away to a city called 

Radom . And Radom , there was a ghetto there and a horribleplace. There was nof ood atall, 

nothing.  Everybody was starving.
  
 
 
Hundreds of people volunteered to go to work for the Germ ans.  Didn't want to 
because thepeopledidn't have possessions.  If  you have nothing, the Germans didn't want to 

take you.W hy? Because they took it away f rom us. If  Ihave nothing, you don'tneedm e.

Finally, they transf er me toanother town
 
--
 
Iforgot thenam e of  it.  The Germ ans 
announcedany Jew who escaped orhiding to com eout
, a
ll the people would be sending over.  
T hey were l ying.  T hey just wanted everybody to getout.  So I went. 
 
 
I was volunteering for the Germ ans to go to work in thef actory called Pionki. T hey 
didn't want to takem e neither because I hadno luggage.
  
T he
re were a coupleof  m y parents' 
f riends,old people, they ga ve m e two bundles to take.T hey toldme, 
ﬁH
ere, take thisand they 
wi ll take you.
ﬂ
  
So sure enough, I got two bundles.  I never knew what was inside. The 
Germ ans tookm eto work in Pionki. T hey
 
took away the bundles but I worked in thefactory.
 
T hey taughtm ehow to m ake powder for bullets.  
 
 
T wo years I was work i ng in thatf actory.  I becam e an expertm aking 
m unition.  This 
was a terrible ordeal.  T here were about2,000 prisoners.  Some of them, the peoplef rom  the 

irri gation canal, the Germ anstook toPionki.My f riends who were working with m e, we wer e 

together. 
 
 
In  P ion ki, the
re was sabotage. T he Germ ans taught
 
us to make sabotage because 
we didn't actually know about sabotage. They accused us of  sabotage.  Soa lotof tim es Idid 

sabotage.  A lotof  tim es I put ina rock or stone in thepum pand everything stopped.  If they 

caught m e, they would have hanged m e
. They hanged a lotof  other people, too. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Since you're talking about that, there was an incident you told me about in 

which the conveyor belt burnedand you were blamedfor that. 
 
>> David Bayer:  Onenight 
--
 
we worked night shift, there were four guys on our departm ent.  I 
worked in the centrif uges, m ixing the chem icals
 
--
 
powder f orthe bullets. The Germ ansm ade 
im itation cottonf rom  paper. It was exactly lik e cotton.  Im ixed that with all kinds of  chem icals.  

T hey taught m e how to put the bullet. 
 
T herewas a young m antheref rom  m y hometown. He 
was a nervous person.  Always wanted to smoke
, l
ikea junky. T hiswas the night shif t.  He 
was the one who was putting the cotton on the conveyor which comes tomy department. He 

worked 12 hours, 24 hours.  He workedfor the Russians, never went hom e, never went to the 

b a rra cks.   He smo k
edthe cigarettes at night,which was f orbidden.T he conveyor was ignit ed 

andthere was af ire. My departm ent stopped. T hey took us out. They beat us the whole 

night.  I was beaten
, b
lood come outof m y back
, t
o tell them  whathappened.  Nobody talked.  
T hey announced that they were going to executeus, allof  us. 
 
 
In them orning, the supervisors, t wo Germ andoctors
 
--
 
two Germans we called them  
doctor,
 
D r.
 
Gonszer and Dr.
 
Vitter, I never forget their name. One was Germ an
-
born and 
Poland.  He spoke Polish and Germ an.  He had the Gestaponot tokill us because we wer e 

experts, we have to teach otherpeoplehow to do that. And luckily they didn't shotus
.   W e 
went back to work right away. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And David, there's so muchfor you to tell us just about Pionki buta couple 

m ore questions.
  
T here was af ire there in which you got burned, pretty severely. 
 
>> David Bayer:  There was a supervisor, a
 
P o lis h  
supervisor.  Heworked in the 
m un i t i o n 
factory bef ore the war.  The Germ ans paidhim .
  
He was a nice guy.  He had
 
to have a gas 
m ask. Everybody was dying over there.  Ibegged him  a lot of times to get me another job.  

Finally he got m e out of there, put somebody else in. I worked
 
--
 
processed cotton,to the 
department to
 
--
 
it was a new job. I worked with the otherPolish supervisor.  I was outf rom 
the ghettos.
 
 
But what happened, the locom otive was going back andforth,backandforth. The 
sp
are cotton wouldf allout.  And it burnedm y arm  andm y faceandm y hands completely
, l
ik e  
swollen up, blisters.  And this was the tim e whenthe Russianarm ies were winning the war

against the Germ ans and were pushing the Germ ans backf rom  Russia. T his was 1944. 
 
T he Germ ans saw theRussians com ing sothey tried to liquidate the factory, dismantle the 
m achinery, and shipever ything to Germany.  Stopped working in thef actory.  W eonly 

dism antled the machinery. 
 

 
T hen I have to stop here and tell you som ething about an incident,what happened in 
our com pound wherewe li ved, thebarracks,our cam p. T he Germ ans cam e in toour barracks 

where we li ved and asked people to volunteer. W e were scared togo. W edidn't have no 

food, nothing to eat, didn't give us nobread, there was no water anym ore.  The Russian Arm y 

airplanesbom barded all the power stations. T here was noelectricity no more.  
 
 
W e were hiding. Andwhen theGermans cam e in, we tried to runawa y, not to
 
go  
with them .
  
But, therewas one Germ an who cam e into the gates. W esaw him  com ing. And 
he was a good Germ an. W hat Im ean 
b y 
a goodGerman? T he reason I m ention that 
because I want to get it in.  I went toa schoolin Virginia and was speaking to kid
s.  T he boy 

askedm e if  Iever encountereda good German. SoI was thinkingabout this Germ an.  So I 

was repeating that. This good Germ an cam ein.  So everybody put their handup,
 
ta ke me .  
Ever ybody wants to go with him  to work.  He was good.  He was polite.  Henever beat us. He 

would say good m orning, goodbye, thank you.  He was anice person. Engineer.
  
B ut th is 
good Germ an pulled apistol and shot in the crowd and killeda man.  Becauseeveryone was 

running.  He got excited.  He was scared.  He didn't know what happened.  He shot aperson.  

W ellf inding out it wasn't a good Germ an.  
 
 
I repeat thatbecause this happened atthe sam etim e the Germ anscam e in and 
tookus away to Auschwitz
, t
ook all the machinery, took all the workers. T heyf igured we 
would buildf actories som ewhereelse. But we wind up inAuschwit z.  And I got aburnhere, a 

burn here onm y face. It was a crustalready. 
 
W henI got off the train in Auschwitz, the Nazis 
standing there, there'sdogs, helpers
, t
hey saw m e. T here was a young m an
, 
a prisoner. He 
said to me, 
ﬁT
ell them that youare chemist, that you makepowder, explosi ves.
ﬂ
  
S u r e  en ough ,  
a Germ an off icer came over andasked me whathappenedtome.  I said I was working in a 

m unitionfactory and he put me aside. 
 
 
So about 30, 40,50people were standing aside there. He pickedup
 
--
 
they took us

T here was a Nazi, a supervisor
,  
a German
; w
alkedaround with a walking stick, a 
copper handle, like apick handle.  He was the one who checked where todrill, where notto 
drill.  He was a m urderer.  He walked around
; 
if  somebody didn't work fastor didn't move, 
sm acked them  on thehead with thepick handle.  Killed a lot of people.
 
 
And then a lot of people pretended
 
--
 
we wer e starving. W ehad nothing toeat.  A 
lot of  them  died.
  
T henthey send in a young m anf rom  Auschwitz to  placethis guy, Ruben.  
Should I talk about Ruben?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yes.
 
>> David Bayer:  A religious young boy, 16 years old, skinny.  He was praying day andnight.  

W hen 
you lookedathim ,he was reciting a psalm . InEnglish, psalm with a p
, s
ile nt  p
, p
s a lm .   
In Yiddish,
 
daven.  Tef ilah
, Heb re w. 
 
W ell, all the tim e you look at 
h im
 
he was praying in 
Hebrew. W e calledhim  crazy, m ashugana,
cra zy.    
 
Oneday, the one whowas drillin g and putting dynam ite was a Pol,a regular guy 
who worked in a coalm ine, a m iner.  He told us oneday
 
--
 
he said, 
ﬁW
hen I say move away 
f rom  thearea, don't repeat nothing, justmove.ﬂ W hen this German supervisor came in to 

check the walls, the
 
ceiling and he already had adrill, put thedynamite in.  He ignited itand 
blow up and killed the Germ an.  Ruben cam e over to every one of us and whispered inour 

ear.  
ﬁ
Didn't God help us?
ﬂ
  
W e didn't call him  crazy no more. 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> David Bayer:  The reason I keep mentioning that
, a
 
lot of questions I get from peopleabout 
God. People wantto know m y relation with God. Every tim e I mention about God,I brought 

up Ruben.  Let him have the credit.  Hebelieved Godhelped outbecausehe was pray
in g.   He  
survi ved the war and lives now in Jerusalem. He's anoldm an, like I am.  He'sa littlebit 

younger thanm e.  He was 11 children.  Im et him about10 years ago.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Keep going.  I'm  sorry.
 
>> David Bayer:  That's all right.  That's whathappened. And then the Russian
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you talk about leaving Auschwitz, tell us about the surgery that you 

were f orced to undergo.
 
>> David Bayer:  Every m orning when we go  to work in our camp to the coalmine, som etim es 

we had to
 
walk, som etim es they would take us on thetrain. There was a roll call. Everybody 
hadto call up. W e had nonam e.W e hadnum bers.  Ihad anum ber.  B74 was my number, a 

tattoo. B74 here.  Everybody call.  Off icer walks around and checkseveryone.  I was in the 

f ron t  lin e.   Com e s in ,  a
 
German with the stickchecking me out. I had an inf ectionand m y 
glands swelled upf rom the coal,f rom the dust,f rom everything else.  Theminutehe saw my 

glands swollen, took me out and sentm e tothe clinic. T hey putm eon a table.  He cut meto 

pieces. No anesthetic, no injection, nothing. I was tied up to the table.
 
 
Here, here is adocument which I will probably gi ve to you. T he Germ an doctor who 
m ade theoperation. They found this in Germany.  My nam e, his nam e, the whole thing.  It is a 

report. Buteverybody who was e xperim ented didn't get out alive. The Germans sent them to 

the gas cham ber. How did I survi ve?  Again, lucky. 
 

 
T here was a Polish man who was in the camp with us.  He was a political prisone
r.   
He was in thePolishunderground. T he Germ an

>> B ill 
Benson:  In January
 
1945, you were brought up out of the coal m inesearly andforced 
to go on what's knownas a Death March. Tell us what happened when they brought youout 
of  the coal m ine.
 
>> David Bayer: W ecam e backf rom  them ine. W e were back toour cam p where we li ved.  

T hey told ustohook up, take whatever you
 
can andm arch out. W e had tom arch in the snow 
to Germ any.  T hem arch was like you see som etim es in theforest,antsand people step on 

them . That's what the Germ ans did.  Pound,pound,pound.  Every fi
v
e m inutes shot because 
you cannot walk nom ore.  The snow was so high, nofood, no 
no t h
ing. W ecannot walk.  
Frozen to death.  Anybody who f all down got killed.  And a lotof  them  couldn't walk no more.  

T hey knew they were going to be shotand they f ell down purposely.  Killed thousands and 

thousands of people without mercy, without anything. 
 

 
I went over to adeadbody af ter they got shot.  I took his jacket.  Iaskedfor 
forgi veness 10,000 times from  him . Buthe saved m y lif e.  He was dead.  Som ebody hadto 

takehis jacket, his clothes. Som ebody took his shoes. 
 
 
It was so cold. T he Germ ans went in the houses to warm upandtold us to liedown 
in the snow. T here was one guy who walked with m e the whole time, holding my hand,m y 

a rm .  
 
He went over toa Germ an who was at the car with the hood up.  He said, 
ﬁ
I 'm  a  
m echanic
.  
I  will f ix yo u r c a r.
ﬂ
  
He wasn't am echanic.  He just wanted to goover thereto warm  
up underthe hood.  He didn'tdonothing. T he German shothim .  He fell right on top
 
--
 
the 
Germ an left the carand him and everything else. 
 

 
Not even inthe movies you could seethat.  Not a cloud of hum anity. W e didn't go to 
them ain highways because the Germ an Nazi s were retrievin g with their tanks and trucksand 

ever ything else because the Russians were com ing. W ehad to walk inf ields, country roads 

until we reached a place called Blechham merin Germany, atthe Germ an
-
Polish border.  
T here was a cam p there.  Russian soldiers, prisoners, allprisoners.
 
 
W e went into the warehouses. W etried to getf ood.  I went to thewarehouse and 
there was only m argarine, stacks and stacksof m argarine, tonsof m argarine.  So I took 

m argarine andput it inm y shoes,m y pants,boxes of  margarine.  I couldn't even walk.  

Previous guys took bread andm arm aladeand everything else. 
 

 
T hen thebarbed wire, there was no more electricity.  You could easily get out.  So 
Russian prisoners were there
, c
ut the barbed wi re and we went andI went with them.  I went 
out. Me, Ruben, and two Russian prisonerswent out through the sam e hole.  W efall down

I 
don't know how they call it, ahole

>> Bill Benson:  Aditch?
 
>> David Bayer:  Down.  T he wire.  You getoutof  the wire, you fall down
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  A ravine.
 
>> David Bayer:  A ravine.  If all on topof  som ebody else.W e went through thef orest.  Ruben 

couldn't walk anym ore, was bleeding.  He said, "I can't walk."  W e took him and puthim  in the 

barn
, a
 
barn on afarm.  Me and two Russians went deep into theforest and stayed therefor 
s i x d
ay
s 
and six nights . W hatdid we eat? Them argarine.  Melted, dirty f rom m y coal dust 
andeverything else.  I never tooka shower. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  It wasm elted allover your body and your clothes.
 
>> David Bayer: W e were cold like hell. Thesnow helped a lot.  It was snowing all the tim e.  

Finally, we didn't know if the Germ ans were still there orthe Russians were there. W ecame 

outby the Russians. And the Russian soldiers saw m e, pickedm eup, carried me like I carr y

told the German wom an totake careof m e. T he Germ an wom an

there was nom an.  She

s
he was scared of the Russian 
soldiers. T hey were ra ping wom en like crazy.   Thedaughter, a daughter but looks dirty and 
ever ything else, pretending to be like this.  She was bathingm e, cooking som e
 
so up .   I d on' t

husband.  Hem ust have got killed or didn't com e home or som ething f rom  the war. 
 

 
And then I was very anxious to leave.  I didn'twant to stay theref or long.  I 
recuperatedfor a while.  I askedher to show m ethe way to them ain highway.  I went back 

walkin g to Poland
, t
ook trains, trucks.  I wentback to m y hometown which I didn'tf indnobody.
 
I didn't like to stay in Poland.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou went back, David,you tried to see if youcould recover any of your 

fam ily's belongings.
 
>> David Bayer:  That's right. W ell,If inally reachedm y hometown.  I went to the cem etery.  

T he cem etery was before you reachedm y hom etown, on the samehighwa y.  I walked over 

thereand lookedfor my grandmother's grave.  She died in the ghetto.  I cried. 
 
 
T here was afarm er that passed by in a wagon.  He stopped.  He cam eup
a

went into the cemetery.  There was no gate. He took me andhelped me.  He took m e to his 

house.  He gave m e som e food. I told him  Iwanted to go tothe person who I left the 

possessions, some of them.
 
 
I went in. T hey didn't expect me to be alive.  So they were ver y sur prised that I am  
alive.  I had nowhere else to go. I stayed there maybe aday or two.  Otherpeople came.  

T hey starteddrinking. I didn't like it. I didn't realize, I shouldn't, I took off . I run away and 

never cam e back. 
 
 
But oneday I went back theretoask them  togi ve m e som e of the possessions.  He

My father hadfour brothers.

T hey kicked the Germans out. And all the Jewish 
m oved in.  Maybe 2,000,m aybe 4,000.  I don't know how.  It was a big cit y.  T he U.N. andthe 
United States provided us with m ilk and honey, so to speak. I was naked.  I had the clothes on 

m e, nothing.  No
 
docum entation. Only m y number. 
  
TheAmericans were there.  They gave 
us cigarettes, chocolate.  T he cigarettes I sold toGermans.  Im adem oney from  the rations the 

Germ ans gave m e

the Am ericans gave m e.  I hadto geta baseof something to exist, no

I had nothing. I didn't like to carry packages anywa y.  I wanted to bef ree. 
 
 
So after the Americans came in,they gave us everything.  You stay here.  They 
gave us m edical things.  Everything we need,food, housing, clothing. Two years.  T wo years 

you take young Jewish m en likem e who cannot sit still, do nothing.So we did business. W e

don'tsm oke.  I made money.  I

$10,000 in two years.  And this was a lot of money in 1945,1946,plenty of

All of  a sudden I got

som ebody is looking for me. David Bayer, som ebody lookingf orm e in Panama.  Afam ily who 

went away to Panam abef ore the war, oneof the sons went to school in the defense. T riedto

A Russian soldier asked me to go to Moscow.  I went to Moscow.  I don't like it.  I 
com e back.  I wentallover Europe.  Every country in Europe I was. 
 
So I wentto Panama. I 
went to Paris, stayedfor a while. T hen wentto Holland. Tooka shipf rom  there. I went 

straight to Aruba, Venezuela, and then Colombia and then Panam a. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e Panam a was the best year of your life.
 
>> David Bayer:  Exactly.  I cam e toPanamacity.  It was m aybe 1,000 Jews.  Some J

 ﬁ
T ell m e later.
ﬂ
  
W antto play cardsall the time.  
W orking all day, com eto the evening. Play cards.  I was bored. 
 
 
So there was a son of the fam ily, which hadadaughter wanted to bem arried. I 
didn't want to getm arried. SoI said
, ﬁ L

ﬂ 
a place on the border of 
Panama, Costa Rica.  
ﬁ
W hat's there?
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
T here's nothing. W e go and make leather over there.
ﬂ
  
ﬁO k. ﬂ
  
Go od .  I go .  I

I went to theplace.  On the border,a place called Concepcion.  Nice people, 
prim itive Indians.  I was m aking

M

I slept in a shack

T hey were hum ble, good people. They were helping me. They wer e loving me. AndI didn't

us Navy had anair base during the war over there. I go there
 w

and everything 
e ls e
 s
elling this stuff .T here was a heavy
-
set  Jew, big gu y with a big belly.  It was hot likehell 
over there.  He called, 
ﬁO
h m y God, what areyou doing here with the Indians?  Lookatm e.
ﬂ
  
I 
said, 
ﬁW
hat?  I'm  all right.
ﬂ
  
He said, 
ﬁL
ook
 
atm e, I am am arried, children. This is what is 
going to happen to you.
ﬂ
  
I sa id, 
ﬁN
o.
ﬂ
  
He said, 
ﬁW
hy don't you go to Palestine, Israel,becom e 
independent?
ﬂ
  
T his was 1948.  I said, 
ﬁN
o,I'm  happy here.ﬂ T he second time he told m ethe 
sa m e th in g. I 
s a id
 
ok
.  
I go  o ut to Isra e l. 
 
Hesaid there was a ship coming to Panam a canal, 
join the ship
; t
hey will gi ve you an assignment.  Go toPalestine. 
 
 
T hat's what Idid. I joined the Israeli Arm y.  I stayed a year anda half in the Israeli 
Arm y during the war. Back to Panam a. W hy did I gobackto Panam a? T here were millions of  

people com ing to Palestine from everywhere else. T here was nowhere to sleep. T here was 

no jobs.  I slept on abench in apark after I was dischargedf rom  the Arm y.
  
So the 
Console 
s a ys
 
go back
; y
ou have apassport, you cango
.
  
SoI went back.  Stayed there until 1955. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And in 1955 is when you came here. W hat prom pted you then to com e tothe 

United States? 
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, m y m other,m y father were reli gious Jews.  My m other, when shewas 

shipped away to T reblinka, I was near the canal and I escapedf rom the canal and was going 

to join the train.  T he supe

; t
hey wi ll kill you, this and 
that. W ell, he savedme, actually.  If  I would go tothe train,I would have gone with m y fam ily 

and wouldnever havecom e back. T hey woul d have killedm e.
 
 
So what happened? Af ter the war when I cam eback,thef irst thing I did, I went to 
the station.  I talked to them an in charge atthe station which I knew.  Then I talkedto the 

people who were selling coal, af riendof m ine who went to school wi thm e.  I askedhim  what 

happened with the people takenonthetrain.Did you seem y father?  Did seemy m other?  He 

told m e.  T he guy wh

m y m other.  My m other told him  if  I'm alive toseem e,toldme, don'tforget you're a Jew, never 

anything else but Jewish.  Children Jewish, in spite of the Germ ans.  If  something happened to 

them , didn't know they would be killed. She yelled out, 
ﬁ N a qam !  N aqa m ! ﬂ   Ye

help. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
David, I'm  going to turnbackto David in afew m inutesf or the last word f or 
today.
 
>> David Bayer:  Onem ore thing.  If I wouldhave to tell you every li ttle detail, would never get 

outof  here. Becauseever y day of m y life a story. 
 

 
Bef ore I went to
 
the ghetto, I went to a placewhere the Germ ans were having af ield 
kitchen, eating their meal.  I took abucketf rom  the house.  My m other didn't know it.  I come 

back, waiting for me.  I went thereto get lef tover f rom the Germ answho didn't like their

T hey gi ve us

a lot ofpeople were waiting, Polish people, wom en, children. I was the only 
Jew over there.  I wassitting there waiting for theGermans. W hen I came home,m y m other
