Q: –name , date of birth, where were you born? 

     

 

A: I was born Nove mber 15, Nove mbe r  20, 1915 in Brooklyn, New York. 

 

Q: Yourname ?  

 

A: My name  is Herman Rafael Goldberg. 

 

Q: Tell me a little bit abou
t your fa mily, fa mily life. 
 

A: My family life was, was very busy.  
My mother was a teacher first and then a 
principal of the school in Brooklyn.  My si
ster wa s a singer, she sang with Rosa 

Ponselle in some  of the operatic producti
ons and um there were just 2 of us my 
sister and I.  I loved sports right fr
om the beginning but did not avoid other 
activities.  Um there were some fi rm exp
ectations from my pa
rents to adhere to 
my responsibilities in school.  My father
 had a hardware store to which I was 
expected to contribute by learni ng about 
the business and helping when necessary.  

My father was president of the hardware 
association of New York City and during 
some  of those days when he had to le
ave early, I took over in the store and he 
gave me  information that I, I just didn™t
 have.  Um, so we had a diverse family, 
mother very busy in her life.  My sister
 busy with emphasis in music, mi ne with 
emphasis in sports. 
 

Q: What about your religious life, 
what kind of background did you have? 
 

A: Um we were born into a Jewish family. 
 I was working at a very early age.  Um 
again part of my mother™s and fathe
r™s feeling was as I said before my 
contribution to the family well being included some  working time.  And uh that 

included complete family life including a
ttendance at neighborhood temple.  Uh 
including kinds of experiences wher
e I would meet other young me n and young 
wome n at temple and uh understanding my 
father™s and mother™s respect for the 
religion of their parents which were on 
display through photographs of an earlier 
era. 
 

Q: So religion was an impo
rtant part of your life. 
 

A: I would say it was a vital part.  Uh I ca
n™t classi fy it as important because there 
were a lot of things that were important
 and the presence of religion and in the

fa mily the Friday evening um service was 
important to me .  Uh it gave me  a very 
nice feeling that when I was 
in Israel one year, um I um was a professor.  I was a 
Fulbright professor at the University of
 Belunga in Italy.  And um one little 
episode I will share with you which is a 
great joy to me .  Um a welcoming uh 
party was scheduled by Abba Eban and S
onya Marabach head of education in 
Israel.  Uh and I was to be the, the guest 
of honor.  Um the taxi driver said to me  
well where are your flowers, this is Sha
bbas this is the Sa
bbath.  Where are you 
where are your flowers, where is your gift
.  I don™t have any flowers, I didn™t buy 
any candy, I didn™t buy anything.  
I just wanted to come .  He said well usually on 
a Friday night, it is expected that you 
bring some flowers to your host.  Um the 
taxi driver didn™t know where Abba 
Eban lived.  He knew the general 

neighborhood but didn™t know the exact 
place.  But he stopped some  young 
people on the street and he sa
id to them, I re me mber ve
ry clearly he said well you, 
you must have ma de some  kind of r e lati
onship with these people from Israel.  
And I said well we did the best we coul
d.  All the florist shops were closed 
because it wa s uh between 4:30 and 5:00.  Th
ey close early and I™m sorry we, we 
had nothing to, to give.  So 
the taxi driver uh dropped my wife and me  off at the 
home  of these officials fr om Israel a
nd about 20 mi nutes later, the doorbell rang.  
And the taxi driver stepped out with a bi
g bouquet of flowers and he handed them 
to my wife and he said he re when you go back in there you will ha ve a gift .  You 

are not supposed to go in there without a gift.  You should bring some thing to 

your host.  And so I asked him how much 
it would cost and he said there would 
be absolutely no fee at all.  It™s my 
pleasure to be delivering you to, to have 
delivered you to the party and to s
ee that as guest of honor you were well 
received.  And so uh everyone was very exc
ited about the fact that the taxi driver 
brought in some  flowers because it was Fr
iday night and uh he felt we should 
have known, we should have reme mb ered but it 
wa s our first trip to Israel so I did 
not know.  But the taxi driver ma de sure 
that all the passages were open after that. 
 

Q: –growing up in Brooklyn.  In terms of being Jewish, were your social contacts 
mi xed.  Did you have non Jewish friends as
 well.  Or was your communit y really 
a Jewish community? 
 

A: It was not a Jewish community.  Th
ere were uh a number of Jewish families 
living in our area, not many.  Uh I would 
say that we were happy together as a 
group, playing sports, singing and music, 
being in school, um doing the kinds of 

things that kids do in a. in a nei
ghborhood school.  I was lucky in being the 
chance to go to Boys High School in 
Brooklyn, kind of a well known school.  Um 
with lots of um talented 
people running the school and I was very delighted to be 
a student at Boys High School. 
 

Q: So your milieu was mi xe d, it was Jewish and non Jewish. 

 

A; It was, that is correct.  The neighbor
hood was Jewish and non Jewish.  My friends 
were Jewish and non Jewish and I can™t c
ount them and say I had 11 friends this 
day and I had 14 friends for the next 3 
weeks.  That didn™t happen. Uh you 

 
 
3

3
worked with the young people whom you lik
ed and uh it was your choice.  And 
um it seemed to work both ways that the 
non Jewish people we re looking at us in 
that neighborhood as newcomers to th
at neighborhood and everything was in 
good shape.  There was no trouble.  We had no 
feelings whatsoever in that regard.  
We had norma l religious training, we  ha
d norma l religious output in attending 

services, in doing the things
 generally are expected of, of boys and girls age 13 
and above.  My father and mother saw 
to that.  And uh it was, it was a joyous 
thing. 
 

Q: And no feeling of being different beca
use you were Jewish or  anti-Semitism or 
anything like that? 
 

A: No feeling of that sort whatsoever, the,
 the sports were mi xed with the religion.  
The sports were mi xed with school.  The 
sports were mi xed with music.  The 
ports were mi xed with whatever activ
ity was going on in, among our small group 
and for that reason I think 
we got along very well.. 
 

Q: Were sports an opportunity for every
body to be together and get to know each 
other? 
 

A: It is, it is an opportunity.  Sports is
 a way in which you can get to know each 
other, in which you can um be happy togeth
er, be distressed together when nec, 

when it happens.  To understand more about
 the Catholic religion, the Protestant 

religion in the neighborhood which serv
es its clientele and it was our 
responsibility, my mother and fathertaught 
us to be together and uh it was, it was 
a fine, it was a fine way to do it and my 
father had a hardware store and in the 
hardware store everyone needs nails 
and screws, hammers, lawn mowers, it 
doesn™t ma tter what religion you are, if 
you need a tool, you need a tool and so I 
learned a lot about the exchange of infor m
ation, exchange of equipment tools, um 
how to ma ke keys, how to fix locks, um
 l-o-c-k-s.  How to prepare uh door 
checks, how to prepare things that needed 
repair that my fathe r  had taken in for 
repair and I was taught how to participate un that. 
 

Q: So it sounds like to me  that you we
re an all Ame r ican boy.  You weren™t 
necessarily just from a J e wish communit
y.  I mean your identification was just– 
 

A: Absolutely.  I™ve oh I™ve never felt either 
on one side of the street or the other side 
of the street, or with one 
collect, connection or another 
connection.  I felt that we 
were together, our group was together and 
we had a lot to enjoy together.  And it 
did occur.  Many of the young people in, 
in my neighborhood were admitted as 
students at Boys High School
, which was I have to say it, a very elite tough 
school where you had to work very, very 
hard to remain to succeed and to get 
ready for college. 
 

Q: Tell me  a little bit about your sports
 activity, what you li
ked, how good were you. 
 

 
 
4

4
A: Uh in my younger years there was no such 
thing as a little leag
ue baseball or Babe 
Ruth league baseball.  Uh fourteen ma
nagers and 26 assistant ma nagers uh and 
some body i n charge of the Pepsi cola a
nd some one in charge of, of some t hing 
else.  There, there wasn™t that kind of 
uh relationship that uh the grouping was, 
was not hard and in that  way um my parents were aware of and permitted my 
participation in sports so I had to balan
ce out the hours I spent 
in sports with the 
hours I gave to sports.  And um it was uh 
a good way I think for me  to learn um 
importance of earning a living how different
 ways exist for earning a living.  And 
uh participating in certain projects rega
rdless of what background you come  from 
religiously. 
 

Q: What sports did you like?  
 how did you get started? 
 

A: Uh well one way in which you get starte
d I guess is by having things close to 
hand.  My father had a hardware store but 
it also had a sporting goods branch to it 
and so I was allowed to go pick out a pair 
of ice skates. I was allowed to pick out 
a pair of roller skates.  I was allowed 
to pick out a brand new basketball and go 
with a team to a certain 
neighborhood to play.  I wa
s allowed to uh pick for 
myself and my Dad sold ma ny of those 
sporting good items  but it wasn™t pushing 
me into sports in order to sell a few mo
re gloves, a few more bats, a few more 
balls, not at all.  And my  Dad liked them
 very much too and that™s why it was 
such a surprise to me when I played ba
seball in the Canadian American league, 

professional baseball on ope
ning day when um the team I was playing with the 
Rome  Colonels, Rome  New York Colonels
, um frankly uh had a, an opportunity 
that no one really ever gets automatic
ally.  And that was my father comi ng 
secretly and I don™t mean secretly in a s
ecret, secretive sense but in a personnel 
sense.  He got on a train and he came up to Rome , New York, didn™t let me  know, 

stood behind the dugout watched the belgium between Ottowa and the Rome  

Colonels, watched his son play.  After th
e game  was over had dinner with his son, 
and a couple of his son™s friends from the 
team and after dinner he got back on the 
train and went back to Br ooklyn to his ha
rdware store.  Kind 
of a homey sequence 
but that™s what he did.  And uh mos t  of– 
 

Q: Followed your career. 

 

A: That, that started it yes.  And as a ha
ndball player, tennis player, um I never had 
golf clubs, we never had that ki nd of money to fill out all the sporting goods that 

exist.  But that was one, that was one 
way to do it and the competition that came 
from sports relationship angles uh was very
 important kind of experience for me .  
Because I, I learned to live with the co
mpetition, to lose when I had to lose 
without crying about it.  To win when I 
could win with joyousness and to share 
with my teammates other, other kinds of 
experiences.  The last thing I would say 
in this regard is that that ma y have b
een the reason why whe n Little League did 
start in Rochester, New York I star ted it.
  And got the teams together uh got the, 
the parents together, got it, 
got it started and then we we
nt off to high school.  I 

 
 
5

played catcher for Boys High School andthen catcher for Brooklyn College.  I 
was on Brooklyn College when I was selected for the Olympic team.  Um. 
 

Q: –how you really got into baseball
, did you love it, how good were you? 

 

A: Well I was it was not a gr eat competitor.
  I was a good compe titor.  I was fair.  I 
worked hard at it.  I had all the move s 
necessary.  I was a ca
tcher very early and 
being a catcher eliminates a 
lot of people from vying for that role.  How to hold 
your hand, how to ma ke sure that the fingers are in such a position that when you, 

when you went to the mi nor leagues 
you didn™t get whacked and have your 

fingers broken there or in Germany.  And 
so it was an attemp t to be able to scoop 
the ball, learn how to scoop it without in
juring your fingers 
and that took some  
doing.  Um so my sports really came fr
om high school from being a catcher at 

Brooklyn College from which I went to the Olympic tryouts in Baltimor e.  And 

the Olympic tryouts were held in 3 pl aces
 in the United States.  In Stanford, 
California, in western state Mi chigan College and in the Baltimore area and there 

were hundreds and hundreds of athletes vying 
for the spots.  There were 21 places 
on the Olympic team, 21.  And there we
re ma ybe 6, 7, 8 hundred athletes vying 
for that, those 21 spots and I was a catc
her selected uh by the coaches for the 
Olympic team from Baltimore, from the east coast tryouts. 
 

Q: You must have been pretty good. 

 

A: Uh I worked hard at it, I worked ha
rd at it.  I knew what I was doing and uh 
wanted to be a catcher right from the  
beginning and catching is
 so hard and so 
difficult and uh it, it™s one of the positions 
in sports where injuries are more likely 
to happen because of the cl
ose activity of the batted ball against the swinging bat 
and your fingers don™t always give that mu
ch.  Um and so I went off to school, 
went off to Brooklyn College, became  an
 athlete on the Brooklyn college team, 
went to the Olympic tryouts, was selected 
for it uh and then had my chanc e  very 
happily with meeting up with Hank Greenbe
rg, the uh first basema n of the Detroit 
tigers who that year was being shifted from 
first base to outfield.  Uh and I talked 
to him about some  things that were goi
ng on that I felt needed adjustme nt and he 

gave prompt attention to what he thinks
 he, what he thought 
he could do.  And he 
did some  things that were very helpful to teammates and others on the team. 
 

Q: –go back to the Olympics.  While you we
re playing baseball in high school and 
at college, we re you ever th
inking in terms of Olympics? 
 

A: Never.  In the first pl ace you couldn™t 
hope and dream for something that di dn™t 
exist, there were no Olympics in the baseba
ll area , there just  we
ren™t any.  It was 
track and field where Johnny Woodruff par
ticipated, sprinters, jumpers, runners, 
uh long distance athletes uh you can think 
about it.  You can dream about it and 
you can me a sure yourself uh side by side with
 other athletes and begin to think of 
your own chances and you try for it and 
you shoot for it and by shooting for it and 

 
 
6

6
at some of t he materials that um may 
become availabl e to you, you will see that 
uh I worked very, very ha
rd to try to get that . 
 
Q: What you™re saying is that while you we
re playing baseball in college it hadn™t 
occurred to you that you mi ght
 be going to the Olympics. 
 

A: Never. 

 

Q: –completethought. 

 

A: What, what I could say is
 that the uh thinking about pl
aying in the Olympics as a 
specific activity compared with uh pl ayi
ng baseball with a semi  pro team with a 
neighborhood team, with a college team, 
far diffe red and thinking of playing 

baseball in college, uh and getting a bid 
to be on the team, all of which were 
helpful, um and I was lucky to be one of 
those selected and as I said they came  
fr om Stanfo rd, western st ate Michigan and the Baltimore area. 
 

Q: Did a coach or some body at
 college suggest that you go 
to these tryouts.  How did 
this come  about? 
 

A: Uh the coach at the college uh at which 
I, I earned a silver medal in baseball when 
I was very young, 16, 17 years of age um kept pushing just said go ahead, keep 

going, keep going, keep going, keep going.  Uh
 yes he wanted me  to, to keep 
trying out.  Um I gave more energy.  
I spent more time in practice I worked 
harder with my teammates.  And um when I went to Baltimor e, there were 2,300 

athletes in the competition.  And uh you we
re tried in all the positions, sliding, 
hitting um throwing.  Uh doubling, triple activities.  Uh all of which I knew 

some thing about– 
 

 

(end first tape ) 

 

(Tape 2 of 3) 

 

A: –for over a month. 

 

Q: How did exhibition baseball in
 the 1936 Olympics come about? 
 

A: Are you ready for the answer now.  E
xhibition baseball in
 the 1936 Olympics 
really started because there was an Am
erican co mmittee on baseball that  was 
pushing very hard for baseball to be in
troduced and attached to the Olympics.  
The uh number of baseball players in th
e world were limited pretty much to 
Central American teams, to all the Am
erican teams of course, South African 
teams uh the kinds of athletes who got
 started early through films, through 
televi sion and began to pl ay at a very early
 age.  It really got introduced because 

 
 
7

7
frankly and I don™t take th
is as a compliment for myself, be cause of Herman 
Goldberg who was in charge of devel
oping baseball in the country of Italy. 
 
Q: I want to go back to Berlin. 

 

A: Please. 

 

Q: So the United States Olympic commi ttee 
decided that they were going to try to 
promote baseball. 
 

A; They were going to try to promote it. 

 

Q: Who ca me  to this decision? 

 

A: Judge J. L. Hoffman of Cincinnati, Ohio was the one who headed the group that 
pushed very hard for baseball to be an 
Olympic sport.   Also the American 
Olympic committee wanted to see baseball
 in the Olympics.  They had seen uh 
ski jumping; they had seen all the other 
sports and they really wanted to see 
baseball in there and it came  about becau
se the committee of the various sports, 
finally agreed that it would be a good th
ing for American baseball to be on the 
calendar and as far as I can tell that™s wh
en it started because I began to get mail.  
I began to ge t the first uh pieces of infor mation about the possibility of a baseball 

tourname nt being held. 
 

Q: And so it must have been pretty exciting to be in this. 

 
A: It was very exciting because well first 
of all the stadium was very large.  125,000 
people watching a baseball series, unheard 
of, unheard of before.  Most of the 
baseball teams in America, 
40,000, 50,000, 60,000 ma ybe but 125,000 who ever 
heard of such a thing.  You heard of it in Berlin, Germany for the first time  and it 
was promot ed by the small group of 28 base
ball players.  There were 28 of us 
assigned to play a series of exhibitions ag
ainst each other and then go out into the 

countryside and demonstrate baseball to
 schools, to colleges, to ma ny German 
institutions, how it™s played uh what th
e difference is between baseball and 
soccer, uh what the rules were.  How the umpires played, played the game .  Um it 

was done um because of America and I was very proud to be  a part of the group 

that kept pushing without pushing.  
We kept encouraging, encouraging, 

demonstrating.  This is how left handed 
first baseme n behave, this is how right 
handed pitchers do this.  If 
you are left handed this is how it™s done.  And um we, 
we put it on the map. 
 

Q: What was the reaction when you were pl
aying these game s in Berlin?   What was 
the audience reaction?  
 

A: The audience reaction wa s very poor, ve
ry poor.  They didn™t like the game, they 
didn™t know the game.  The diamond, the 
baseball diamond was never laid out 

 
 
8

8
like a diamond.  They took a four inch white
 silky tape and they
 pressed it into the 
grass.  And they ma de a, a, a uh diamond out of it for baseball.  But they never 
actually ma de a baseball field, never.  Itcaught hold to some  extent, not to such 

extent as in other countrie
s, especially central America.  But it became  a vivid 
activity because it came from America.  A lo
t of the kids wanted very much to 
know more about America and the sports
 were very important to them too. 
 

Q: But the audience was not excited. 

 

A: The audience was not excited because  the pace of baseball mu ch slower than 
soccer.  In soccer the, the ball is 
mo ving, moving, moving, moving, mo ving all 

the time  and the kids are kicking you, 
and they™re kicking you, they™re kicking 
you and they™re circling and they™re beati
ng out the other guy whereas in the the 
sports you play hard or you jump hard, you, you run hard.  You do all of the 

things yourself, but in baseball you™re pa
rt of a team.  And 
it™s necessary to uh 
understand that and uh the crowds on 
the baseball field were 100,000?   not 
125,000 
 

Q: –the period before you went over to 
Berlin.  How much did you know at that 
time about what was going on in Nazi Germany? 
 

A: I knew less than I guess I am told 
I should have known by ma ny people who 
asked me  how come  you went to Ge
rmany when this was going on.  The uh 
number of Jewish athletes, sort of about 8 or 9 out of 328.  Um the number of 

Jewish athletes who ma de the team a nd 
then quit 3 or 4 of those.  Knowledge 
about what was going on with Hitler beginni
ng to come  more close to us.  Um.  
One of the most telling experiences that
 I had personally we™d lived in a small 
cottage .  Mine happened to be name d Brandenbourgh cottage.  Because Hitler had 

charged money to all the dead residents of Brandenburg.  To pay for his cottage 

and then they, another group paid for the,
 their, their name d cottage.  Another 
group paid for this and I can recall very vi
vidly the um concern I had when I went 
down and I saw a big chain at the baseme
nt door of our village.  There we re 28 
players who lived in the Brandenbourg dorf 
in our village and uh what I saw in 
the rear of the cottage was a door and 
another door and then a chain.  And I 
opened the chain and I wa lked, started to
 walk downstairs in the bottom of a 
baseme nt.  And there was a big cavernous ar
ea.   I didn™t know what it was for but 
I sure found out.  That it was for Panzer
 tanks, German tanks because what they 
did was declare the Olympic dorf, and the athl ete and the military chiefs were 

housed where the Olympic athletes were 
housed after the Olympics were over and 
I was told by a woma n who took care of that
 building.  Raus, raus, raus, get out of 
there.  Get out of there, get out of ther
e.  She didn™t want me  looking down in the 
baseme nt.  I didn™t know what was down th
ere but it turned ou
t that it was large 
enough, the cellar or the baseme nt whatever 
you want to call it, in my, my cottage 
you, you find these picture ma terial that wa
s brought to the studio today.  Uh you 
will find uh structures that look like reso
rts but when you walk down there, the 
cavernous, they™re empt y.  They™re the 
thick the uh the cement was about 10, 12, 

 
 
9

9
15 inches thick.  And that couldn™t be 
for just a car or a jeep or a truck.  
Some thing big had to be in the basement
 that had floors this thick.  You never 
saw such thick floors and uh it turned out that that became the west point  of 
Germany 
 

Q: At what point did you realize this was what it was? 

 

A: I realized what it was after I was in 
Germany and after I had seen enough of the 
activity that led to uh the early moveme
nt of labor camp people into army men 

and from boy scouts into young soldiers a
nd from ordinary me n uh with ordinary 
credentials, carrying shovels,
 dressed in regular clothe
s but carrying shovels ready 
to clean out as soon as the American athl
etes left, ready to 
clean out what they 
could from t here to get it ready for the army. 
 

Q: So you saw this as you were departing? 

 

A: I saw this about half way there.  I w
ould say about 4 weeks, 4 weeks before we 
left.  I saw it and they were very st rict
 very angry because I, I was the only one 
who went down to the baseme nt and it was just a happenchance walking down a 

flight of stairs, we were moving a ch
ain and being yelled at by the German 
hausfrau and house ma n who didn™t like what
 they saw.  I mean American down 
in their property, that was going to b
ecome  a Panzer tank unit as soon as the 
game s were over. 
 

Q: You stayed in Germany fo
r how long after the Olympics? 
 
A: Um, about 2 weeks. 
 

Q: So I™m sorry but I™m a little confused.  When you say you saw people comi ng in 
with shovels getting ready 
to transform the Olympic village.  This was while you 
were there for the Olympics? 
 

A: Yes and the ma terials that we found by 
our beds, they were very large books 
ma rked Berlin.  Just the name  Berlin on 
the outside and in that book were pictures 
of me n ma rc hing in parade 
but they weren™t equipped with Army unifor ms, they 
were equipped with regular 
clothes, with work clothes,
 with uh seemingly baskets 
and then shovels on the shoulder and they 
were wa lking this way, this way, this 
way through the whole area there and uh wh
at we found out was that they were 
not only being prepared for their part in
 the Olympics, but some  were ready on, 
on the grounds.  Ready to be instructed in how to go ahead and um fill in the 

tanks that we re going on. 
 

Q: You said there were books that would say Berlin.  Or boxes. 

 

A: There were boxes of books.  Very, very large books. 

 

 
 
10

10
Q: With photographs of the– 
 

A: Yes, on the outside it just said Berlin
, one word, that™s all and you turned pages 
and you saw pictures of the army and you turned more, there™s one on 

everybody™s bed, propaganda ma terial and 
it was, it was on everybody™s bed and 
nobody gave them up because you, you were
 intrigued, and you were reading 

them, what is this all about.  So I bega
n to learn more about Hitler and Goebbels 

and some  of the others after I turned 
pages.  And uh I noticed that the um 
Olympics were for other purposes than storage. 
 

Q: How odd this is that they w
ould leave this for you to see. 

 

A: Howwhat? 

 

Q: Odd this is. 

 

A: How odd?   Well I, I would say it would 
be stupid first, odd yes.  Uh.  An open 
door down to a baseme nt that had no use ot
her than for storage 
of large tanks and 
ma terials.  Uh that™s of war. 
 

Q: So before you went to Berlin, you didn
™t know too much about Nazi Germa ny? 
 

A: That™scorrect. 

 

Q: Now there was some  moveme nt in the United States um in regard, regard the 
boycott, were you aware of that? 
 

A: I was aware of some  of
 t he activities that were 
going on throughout the United 
States in different pa rts, there were 
programs whi c h uh um di splayed the feeling 
about uh Germany, what  was happening, wh
at was going on.  Hitler™s preparation 
um the uh um activity going on in the in 
the field, in the ma nufacturing areas, the 
building the construction, all of those th
ings were, were apparently going on.  
Also uh the American athletes and all ot
her country had its athletes separated by 
action and by that I me a n by what, summer
 sports, winter sports, differing kinds 
of activities trying to separate them a
nd you could see that uh if you opened the 
doors to look into places and the house ma n and the house frau caught you, you™d 

get yelled at but they didn™t do anythi
ng.  They didn™t want to hurt anybody and 
they didn™t want to give 
away their, some  of their secrets about their, their non 
relations with the United States.  Um that™s
 one of the one of the I, I think first, 
first time  he ought to be aware of wh
at is surface, the surface on, on a cottage 
game .  And uh if he has another chat we 
should have the chat, we should have the 
chat, we should not be afraid to have so
me one here telling us how he or she feels 
about what™s going on.  It ma y not get it
 all so smoothly.  You ma y or you ma y 
and you have to work it out to find out wh
at, what is going on that is happening 
with the Olympics that you are part of
 it, you™re really not part of because 
some body else is running it now and you™re
 some one else in a cotton uniform 

 
 
11

11
ready to run uh for the next period of 3 or 4 
weeks.  I, I™m not sure what else I can 
say on that particular topic.  I ma y have, I ma y have me ssed it up. 
 
Q: –a sense of before you went to Berl
in.  Excuse me  one mi nute–boycott in the 
United States, were you aware of it? 
 

A: Uh yes I was some what aware.  The pr
ess gave so me  space to the problems in 
Germany not full space.  Not full uh de
scription of what mi ght be going on 
underneath the table uh.  It wasn™t that 
kind of a, a fullness of expression.  But 
there was enough information comi ng because
 Hitler was begi nning to, to ma ke 
dema nds which were so great and impossi
ble that you, you had to have a feeling 
that you were into some thing that
 was going to be very, very rough. 
 

Q: Was there talk about a boyco
tt, about not going to the game s? 
 

A: There was so me talk about it, yes there wa
s and, and a lot of th
e talk was direct ed 
at the pr esident of the American Olympic 
commi ttee, who I think gave very little 
preliminary credence to it.  But he wanted
 to see what was happening and he as an 
old time pole vaulter from Yale University  and the head of the American 

Olympic committee behaved in such a way th
at um 8 or 9 of us who were Jewish 
were, were not in the game s.  I wa
s there because I was working with a 
demonstration group, not a competitive group 
at that time .  We were striving to 

teach enough skills so that they would sa
y next time  around, we want a baseball 

team, we wa nt a baseball team
 and didn™t happen that way. 
 

QW:  So you were allowed to play in Berlin because you were in a non-competitive 
sport? 
 

A: I think that would be one reason that
 the American Olympic committee chairman 
uh Nor man Ar mitage uh did not have any f
eeling against me  or against Jews that 

he was visibly going to show. 
 

Q: Did you think before going to Berlin as a Jew that ma ybe you shouldn™t go? 

 

A: Not for one mi nute, absolutely not one 
mi nute.  I talked with a number of the 
sports leaders in our local area in Bro
oklyn, New York.  I talked with the coaches 
at Boys high school and uh I told them
 what the goals were and I was not 
discouraged.  I was not encouraged.  I wa
s just say well, here™s your chance to 
learn some thing and I did not speak Germ
an but I uh began to use some  of the 
German that I knew in some  of the di
scussions.  Now the Olympic village was 
about 12 miles from the city of Berlin. 
 Marty Glickman and I were headed for 
downtown Berlin from the village town to downtown.  Um we were interested in 

two things, one uh a boxing ma tch that was goi
ng to take place that day and some  

other events about uh kids who uh were 
in difficulty but uh were good athletes.  
Now in the fi rst instance that I mentione
d uh the bus we had missed and there was 
a bus that ran every 30 mi nutes from the 
Olympic village to dow
ntown Berlin.  If 

 
 
12

12
you mi ss the bus you are out of luck for the 
next 30 mi nutes.  And so Marty and I 
were headed for downtown Berlin and we did not ma ke it.  We were late and so 
we went out on the highway and we put up 
our thumb to get a ride, dressed in the 

American Olympic uniform, we had no troubl
e being picked up.  We  were picked 
up by Germany um athletes in uniform, Ge
r man army me n a c tually, in uniform 
with a sidecar, a motorcycle with a si d
ecar and Marty and I got in the sidecar and 
he drove us we were almost through with
 the 12 miles.  And I asked the question, 
I asked the driver of Boxinyaki Vilsen
 from Veronica Staaten, from North 
America right.  Is Jackie Wilson from 
the United States of America going to be 
boxing tonight.  Yako Wilson from the Unite
d States going to be boxing tonight.  
Huite, Heinte, I use the word Heinte, the 
Jewish word for tonight.  Instead of 
Hoyte which is the German word for tonigh
t.  If I wanted to know are all of you 
going to the movies tonight, hoyte, are you al
l going tonight.  So
 I didn™t say it the 
right way.

(Tape 3 of 3) 

 

Q: From the Ol ympic village did you ever tr
avel around or go into
 Berlin and have 
any unusual experiences? 
 

A: Yes, there we re opportunities to go fro
m the Olympic village 
into the city of 
Berlin uh every 30 mi nutes.  It was a speci
al bus arranged for the athletes fr om 

different countries.  I can recall one even
t when Marty Glickman a friend of mi ne 
from Syracuse University had an opport
unity to go downtown together and we 
went on, we went out on the road ready to 
thumb a ride into, into the town and uh 
it the way it worked out was that a German 
jeep uh or a, or a with sidecar came  by 
and saw our thumbs out waiting for a ride a
nd so they stopped and they invited us 
in.  We  went in, into their vehicle an
d we moved along very rapidly and at one 
point in the ride, the German driver said
 to us um can I see your uh passport.  
Your (autograph? )   And he 
said to me can I see your 
autograph also in German.  
And uh we had them wi th us but we didn™
t think it was their ri ght to have them 
and so I went  beyond that and I said um, uh tell me did will Yaquie Wilson from 

Veronichastaten from North America be
 boxen heint, I was really speaking 
Yiddish, the word heint meaning tonight 
and instead of saying hoyte which is 
tonight in German, I said heinte and so 
that aroused their concern somewhat and 
um they asked us to stay over on the side
 of the highway.  They talked to us a 
little bit, much of which we couldn™t understand but they asked for our autographs 

in spite of the fact that  they were saying to themselves, these ar e two Jewish 

athletes.  We were dressed in uniforms 
so they knew what, what we were doing 
there.  Uh the uh opportunity for knowledge
 of other country would be helpful to 
them so they asked us for our autographs but being stopped on the road, driving 

along with him and then being stopped to
 be asked uh what, what your autograph, 
what your number was and then linking that
 to uh, a request for an autograph was 

unusual, that did happen yes.
  And it was frightening.

Q: I going into Berlin di d you notice any signs of Nazi Germany and anti-Semitism?  

 

A: There were, there were 
beginning signs going up, ther
e  w e r e  w o r k me n ,  s o me  me n  
some  wome n in ladders climbing 3,4,5 step ladders, taki ng down signs, putting up 

signs uh identifying where they did not wa
nt you to be where you were forbidden 
to go.  Uh we saw those quite often. 
 

Q: Cause a Jew. 

 

A: That™sright. 

 

Q: What did the sign say? 

 

A: Juden verboten, Jews forbidden to, 
to ride on this, on 
this road.  Um. 
 

Q: I think I need you to restate this–say
 a complete–did you see indications of the 
anti-Semitism when you went into Be rlin? 
 

A: Yes there, there were some. 

 

Q: Therewerewhat? 

 

A: There were two situations which were 
very frightening.  Marty Glickman and I 
were uh on the highway we had just. 
 
Q: –thesigns. 
 

A: We were in the, in the, in the bus and uh we were um asked for our autographs.  
We wondered why and they were beginningto understand when they said, when 

they saw my  autograph, Herman Goldberg, 
yiddishman, a Je wish ma n that it was 
some thing that they should have been mo
re cautious about.  At least they were 

very scary to us at the beginning and we di
d our very best to steer clear of them 
and we walked the last mile or 2 into, into town and I, I went to where I wa nted to 

go to the uh music hall to hear the, the 
opera Die Fleidermaus 
and Marty went to 
some  event that I can™t recall what he went for. 
 

Q: In Berlin itse lf were th
ere signs of the Nazi regime ?  
 

A: Uh no there were, they were not, they 
were being very careful to uh keep those 
hidden from direct public view.  There 
were uh some  evidences where um news 
people news syndicated peopl
e, syndicate people wanted
 to see if there were 
troubles going on between Germany and the United States because of the 

existence of Hebrews on the American team
.  And uh it was clear to us that they 
wanted those signs down and so there were some  ladders ma ybe 4 to 6 feet tall 

that I noticed very carefully and there we
re me n and wome n on that ladder corps.  

 
 
14

14
Uh directing whether or not
 those people were going to stay on that uh we re going 
to move awa y from it.  Uh. There was nosmooth sailing.  It was dreadful to think 
of what mi ght be comi ng ahead.  You c
ouldn™t quite tell everything.  Um the 
preparations for athletic events, the pr ep
aration for musical events, et cetera were 
all things that were good things and 
you couldn™t tell imme di
ately that there uh 
anxiety over seeing what they could 
do to Americans could be completed. 
 

Q: Did you have any other experiences wher
e you were alarme d or felt that there was 
danger or that this anti-Semitism was rampant? 
 

A: Yes, there wa s one series of events wh
ere I felt that the uh some  ne ws syndicates 
in America who were very anxious to get 
evidence that  things were not going well 
for American athletes and that they would 
like to have me  a nd then perhaps others 
spread the story through their syndicated ne
ws service, spread the word that uh 
things were not going to be good for Amer
ican athletes of Jewish background.  
Um the, the possibility of manufacturing such events 
when they really didn™t 
exist, was presented by one person from an Amer ican news syndicate.  It was a 

kind of situation where ummy, my greatest hope would ha
ve been the ability to 
just knock them out on the floor uh and get them off the boat.  He followed the 

boat out into the ri ver and then met th
e boat 80 miles from New York checking on 
where could he get where could he dig a good story. 
 

Q: But there was no foundation for this. 

 

A: But there was no foundation 
for that, that™s correct. 
 
Q: Speaking of the boat ride over, wh
at was that like?  was it exciting? 
 
A: It was very exciting. 

 

Q: Say the boat ride over. 

 

A: Yes, the, the boat ride over was very
 exciting.  People were
 thinking about um 
Eleanor Holmes Jarrett, wondering about 
the allegations that she was drinking, 
using alcohol, using tobacco, there were 
statements having to
 do with I think a 
reduction in the credibility of some  of th
e American athletes was rampant.  And 
uh it got cleared up I think after the th
ing was laid out on the table and was 

forcefully presented. 
 

QW:  What was special about this boa
t ride over?   Wha t  was happening? 
 

A: What was happening was the athletes 
were not sitting around, they were in 
training.  I was surprised.  Jesse Owens
, Marty Glickman uh Marty Stoller a 
whole bunch of athletes, running, jumping. 
 

 
 
15

15
Q: I need you to say that over because you sa
id Marty Stoller instead
 of Sa m Stoller.  
So what was going on on the boat? 
 
A: Uh there was a great deal of activity 
going on, on the boat.  They were practicing 
in their events.  They were move me nt
, there was, there was nobody sitting around 
reading a book.  Uh they were trying ha
rd to keep their weight down.  They 

worked very hard in every aspect of uh
 self care.  And it was important because 
these athletes needed to have that great
 uh spirit, the great ability, the great uh uh 
bodily condition in which to particip
ate and I think the Amer icans had it. 
 

Q: Was this an exciting opportunity for you? 

 

A: It was an exciting opportunity for me  
for the first reason, Mickey Cochrane was 
aboard ship and one wondered  why would 
the manager of the Detroit Tigers be 
on board ship.  Well uh all the um a nxiety 
about it ended for me  when I got word 
that I was picked up by the Detroit Ti gers
 to become a me mber of the Detroit 

Tigers as, baseball team and to become  a 
me mbe r  of that a rookie staff and then to 

play with that team.  And to play with 
Buffalo in the International League.  Uh 

they were all very excited to have ma
jor league ma nagers talk to you and who 
knows how much they were watching and 
what notes they were taking, who 
knows.  I don™t know.  But at any rate 
it was a great feeling that um having 
important people on board ship was presen
t and they were taking um plenty of 
time to talk to athlet es and to be with 
them and to try to assess what they were 
really like and uh I was lucky.  I happ
ened to hook on well with the Detroit 
Tigers. 
 
Q: The game s themselves, what was it like being there? 
 

A: It was thrilling in so ma ny ways because you looked out on the playing field and 
you saw room for 125,000 people.  Not ev
ery event drew 125,000 people.  Some  
drew fewer numbers than that but however 
it was a very exci ting thing to see that  
size crowd.  Also to see a group playing a 
game  that they weren™t used to.  The 
foul lines we re white ribbons four inches 
wide and they didn™t put plaster of paris 

or yellow uh white dirt down on the field. 
 

Q: –move on–the atmosphere, the general ambience. 

 

A: In the stands where I sat next to Mart
y Glickman for several weeks while events 
were going on there were some  things 
happening that uh gave you some  more 

idea of what was going on.  Hitler did not st
ay in the visibl e area of his private 
balcony when a German athlete won an event.  When a Germa n athlete won an 

event he walked out on his little balcony.  
He raised his hand.  There as a lot of 
applause and then uh he went back in. 
 When a black at hlet e perhaps Jewi sh 
athletes too, there were very
 few of us.  I couldn™t count, there wasn™t time  to 

count uh the Jewish athletes 
and the black athletes especi
ally caused Hitler to turn 
around and to walk out of his own privat
e balcony.  In other words he did not 

 
 
16

16
want to be seen praising a black athlete ev
en in his own track and field area.  He 
just didn™t wa nt to be seen. 
 
Q: So what you™re saying is, explain this
 to me  once more.  You could see Hitler 
from where you were sitting? 
 

A: From where I could see Hitler.  I coul d see Hitler every single day.  I could see 
him every day because hi s travels were ma inly going from ins i de the ba lcony, 

outside.  Some  applause for the German
 athlete.  His hand down when a black 
athlete won an event and his reverse a
nd his walking out of his balcony when 

some  the country became the winner of an
 event.  He did not demonstrate the uh 
real feelings of uh Olympi
c history, Olympic me aning, Ol
ympic strength.  He did 
not demonstrate that at all.  It was only 
what he could gain out of his own team™s 
participation. 
 

Q: And so he didn™t even salute other 
whi t e  at hl et es basi ca
lly just his own? 
 

A: He did not salute white at
hletes, he stayed away from any opportunity to applaud 
an athlete who won an event who came  from
 a c ountry that he 
didn™t like perhaps.  
I can™t describe it another way but it, I 
would say it would be 
accurate to say that 
uh he removed himself fr om his own privat
e balcony as often as he wanted to, to 
demonstrate his own feeling and uh that™s 
what I saw all the time.  Marty and I 
were very close to the balcony where, 
Hitler™s balcony were not far away.  We  
could see that happening, hi
s walking back and forth. 
 

Q: What was it like seeing Hitler up close like that? 
 
A: Uh I was no more than five feet away fr
om hi m in the swimmi ng meets.  I went to 
the swimmi ng meets and I learned that Hitl
er we nt to ma ny of the events without 
prior notice.  For example 
wrestling.  Swi mmi ng.  Uh 
the kinds of events that 
didn™t draw big crowds and without prior no
tice.  In other words he didn™t tell all 
on the phone the commi ttee connected with 
a particular event.  He would just 

arrive there I his car, get out, follow his 
entourage, get up in the stands, sit there 
for 3, 4, 5 minutes, get out, go to the next 
one.  That we saw very often.  Um there 
was nothing that I can report th
at indicates that some  one in charge of an athletic 
event of such great importance would beha
ve that way.  I could, I could sense it 
yes. 
 

Q: Was there some thing frightening about
 him?   Something awesome about him?  
 

A: Yesbecause. 

 

Q: I need you to say the whole thought. 

 

A: Yes, I, I think there was some fr ighten
ing um cha r acteristics of that type of 
behavior because it was evident that he 
did not wi sh to demonstrate fairness to uh 

 
 
17

17
athletes from several different countries
.  Uh he avoided the opportunity to be 
even handed as often as possible which is 
one of the, one of the credos of the 
Olympiad to, to be fair to 
all the countries of the world. 
 
Q: Was there anything just visceral
ly significant about his presence? 
 

As: Uh, walking out onto the field, 
he did that at the beginning. 
 

Q: Please say that again. 

 

A: When Hitler was walking out onto the fi eld and that happened several times, it 
was very, very difficult to understand uh 
how he could possibly behave one way 
in the stands, another on the field, anothe
r way to the press.  Another way to 
perhaps his own political l
eadership.  It was very difficult to understand that 
because um the uh work of the Olympiad 
is entirely different than, than be ing 
angry at other people.  It™s being friendl
y, it™s being togetherness, trying to work 
together, trying to understand each othe
r from different parts of the world. 
 

Q: Did he have a commandi ng presence? 

 

A: What is it? 

 

Q: Did he have, did Hitler
 have a commanding presence? 
 

A: Hitler had a very comma nding presence. 
 Never strong enough to present it solo 
but always second or third line with other 
protective units around him all the time. 
Never, never walking into a situation by 
hims elf but at least Goebbels and ma ny 
of the others, 10, 12 people surrounding, wa
lking uh in a way that would, would 
give you a fright. 
 

Q: And the audience went wild for him.  What happened? 

 

A: When he entered the stadium, when Hitler entered the stadium there was great 
applause.  There was tremendous attempt for his own citizens, his, his German 

participants, his German spect
ators to applaud uh the, hi
s, his presence ye s that™s 
true and they felt that he was the produ
cer of this grand spectacle, this grand 
spectacle to make it possible for the rest 
of the world to be waiting and watching 
uh what was going on in Hitler, in Germany at this place. 
 

Q: I wanted to ask you a question again 
about your role over there because I know 
that in Berlin you played exhibition 
game s and after that you did what? 
 

A: After we played an exhibition game , we
 would assign a series of locations where 
the 28 of us on the Olympic baseball team 
were divided into squads and working 
with local uh physical education teachers
 and leaders uh to teach baseba ll to 
clubs, to teams, to, not to fight them agains
t their great desire to play soccer but to 

 
 
18

18
teach them that ther e was another sport a
nd that the rest of the world was waiting 
for them to come into baseball. 
 

Q: Did you play exhibition game s in these locations? 

 

A: We played exhibition ga
mes throughout Germany yes. 
 

Q: Did you ever experience any anti Jewish
 sentiment while you were doing this? 
 

A: None whatsoever on my , my part, none 
on my part.  The only anti-Semitic feeling 
that I had slight touch for had to do w
ith the um the newspaper syndicated people 

who wanted to meet a 
manufacturer™s story.
