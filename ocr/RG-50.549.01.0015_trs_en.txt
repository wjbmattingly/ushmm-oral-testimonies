were religious, they
 __________ Shabbis(ph), 
like they say. 
Kept the Shabbis and we kept 
a kosher home and that's 
what I do now because I

r-religious, but when I 
br ok e my leg that was t w o 
mont hs befor e t he Germ ans 
in vaded Belgium, he would 
go t o m y grandm ot her ,  thr e e, f our, f iv e 
m iles and ask if he 
can take me to the 
hos p ital f or my leg.  M y  gr
andf at her would say ,  yes, s he'
s  a girl, when s h e want s t o  
marry, she'll have one leg 
shorter than the other one, yo
u better take her to the 
hospital because my father wouldn't ride 
on the Shabbis, so he
 would go to my 
grandfather
 and ask what should he do
.  And a girlfriend of 
mine, a school frien d  
who saved my life and that I'

 it because ot her wise I '
ll have one le g, 
God for b id,  short er t han the ot
her and t h at' s v ery im port ant 
at that time.  Because if

"I won't squeal on you".  
 

Q:  What did your neighborhood

fferent?  Did, how was it 
different?

Q:  Let ' s go back a little bi
t.  Why, what was going on
 that made your parents 
conc er ned enough t o s e

A:  I was a ver y nerv

other didn't want to leave and 
as my friend said, "I
 have an aunt who lives out of 
town and she will 
take care and 
why don't y ou let her t h
ere?"  So they decided
, and I' ll nev er f or get,  I went by t r ain ,  
my father took me by the, 
to the train, and in Be lgium,
 in Ant w er p, if a G er m an 
walk ed in the street and y
ou were Jew, you should walk 
in the middle of the street, 
not on the sidewalk where the 
G erm an.   M y  fat h er m us t  hav e been exc ited t h at h e  
leav es m e, who k nows  if he' l l see me again,
 he didn't know, it would be so bad, we 
walk ed on the street, a 
German came, stoppe
d and gave him two beatings on the 
fac e.  And I had a v er y big 
respect for my father and 
I  star ted t o cry and shout 
bec aus e who would s l ap m y f ather?  I nev er 
saw it, I never hear d 
of it __________. 
That 's it.  He had a st ore f i

me to the stat ion to take the train I 
should go to the people wh

Q:  __________.
 

A:  Nothing, you wouldn't da
r e t o say s om et h ing bec a us e my  bes t  f r iend t h at I tell 
you, her m ot her had a stor

re G erman coming int o  her  
and what kind of fr iendship 
s h e had wit h him.  And he 
liked me because he had a 
child t he same age as mine and
 he liked me very much, 
he want ed only t o give m e  
a k is s or a hug and I didn't want.  So, o
ne day I wor e m y Dav i d 
St ar and I went in 
the street  wit h m y m ot her  and I  walked ac
ross the street, I saw the Germ an.  He 
didn't know I'm Jewish.  So I 
r u n in the f ir st s t or e, my m ot her didn't  underst and the 
reas on.  So t h e s ec o nd day he cam e  to 
m y fr iend's  mot her  
and he said, "I could 
hav e giv e n any am ount of  m oney
 that I saw that little An
ny,  but  it was  a J e wis h gir l ,  
it 's not Anny, but she j ust look lik e her ". 
 He saw me but he, he
 couldn't believe it  
was me because I'
m not Jewish, he didn't
 understand.  I didn't
 know what he would 
have done if he would know, 
but he was sure it
 was me.  And it
 was me.  But I 
disappeared, I wa s very fas
t, I disappeared when
 I saw his f ace.  
All that I had in 
mind is go, go.  T h at 's what  I did.
 
Q:  So y ou'r e descr ibing already s om e 
new rules.  You ha
d to wear a st ar.
 
A:  Yea h.
 
Q:  Of David.  If you saw a 
German coming, yo
u had t o get out of t h e str e et.
 
A:  Yea h.
 
Q:  What were some 
of the other rule s?
 
A:  T h e r u les t h at c h ildr en couldn't go in
 the regular school.  Ch
ildren couldn't go in 
the libr ar y.  Couldn't go t o 
any doctor they wanted, only 
to cer t ain doct ors.   T her e 
was a lot of things you coul
dn't do,  a lot of  things.
 
Q:  And how did your pare
nt s exp l ain it to y o u?
 
A:  They s at down and t hey t o ld us t h at
 because we Jewish, they look, not Jews 
lik e we, J e ws t h at are the t h ir d gener at i on 
t hey c h ec k.   And t h
ey explained to us 
and t h at' s it .  And I alway s 
said I could write a book, lo
t  of st or ies bec aus e I went  
through, during the hiding, a lo
t that I didn't even
 say my tape.  An
d that's it.  And  
now I don't get a penny from th
e G erm ans, I do
n't get a penny.
 
Q:  __________ explore that, not righ
t now, but when 
we do the whole 
__________.  So how soon af
ter the Germans, do you re
member hearing that the 
Germans had invaded?
  Do you rememb
er that moment?
 
A:  Oh, yeah
.  Oh, yeah.
 
Q:  What was that like?
 

A:  That was the 10 of May,
 1940, they invaded Be lgium. 
 An d as I told  you before, 
the Belg ian Jews didn't know how bad it is
, we ran away.   And 
then when we c am e  
back , they said t hat t h e J e ws fr om Belg
ium, born in Belgium,
 would not be taken 
away, the Queen announced.  And my aunt 
wa s born in Belgium and she didn't 
hide or nothin g.  But my unc
le was s itt ing t h er e and he 
liv e d t hr ee days , ev ery t hin g  
closed, they took them aw
ay and he was left because 
he was hiding.  Had a child 
one and a half a
nd s i x  years old.  Then 
aft er thr ee days when he c a me down, the y  
were gone.  And he was cl
osed in the apartment, in 
the house, it was a house.
 
Q:  But, so, the scenario is 
this, that the Germans invade
d, many, many Jews lef t .  
After a few days they 
came back and they 
found these new rule
s.  How long did 
you liv e like that bef or e  your 
parents decided it
 was not safe?
 
A:  Two years.  Two years. 
 It started and st
arted and people would go away and go 
away, and my parents wouldn
't leav e m y grandf at her a
nd that 's the reason we 
stay ed and that' s the r e as on 
they were t a ken away.  An
d my gr andf at
her was taken 
away and then he was 78. 
 M y gr andm ot her was  t ak en t o a hospit a l wher e she 
lived during the war.  But my
 father was a very
 good son, as you 
can understand. 
From all the five sons
, he wa s the only one 
who didn't want to 
leav e.  T hat ' s it.
 
Q:  Di d that cause arguments between your
 mot h er and y o ur f at her ?  Did your 
mother want to leave?
 
A:  I don't thin k so because 
she let him decide and she di
d wh at he wanted.  That's 
it.
 
Q:  Did you ev er t alk 
about it with your older brother,
 you and y o ur br other m i ght b e  
sit t ing t o get her?
 
A:  May b e not muc h, he t o ok me muc h youn
ger than I wa s and fe
lt he's older, h e  
shouldn't tell me, he shouldn't 
talk  about it .  But, that's 
all what I remember, maybe 
yes, but I don't __
________ spoke a lot. 
 We didn't talk.
 
Q:  Did your father ever 
try to explain it  to you?
 
A:  No, he explained 
to me that I'll be a short whil
e by thes e people, th en they' l l 
com e and pic k m e up t o be hom e.
 
Q:  So, let's talk  about this. 
 Was there any one 
thin g that made your parents decide 
that you should go into hiding?
 
A:  Yes,  they said that  a lot of  my friends
 were taken away.  My
 best friend,  s h e was  
a little older, she said , "Oh, 
I am so happy to go
 away, I'll be able 
to put blue on my 
eyes and lipstick".  
And she didn't know where and
 what she's going.  And my 
parent s said we want
 you to be som e wher
e we know wher e y o u ar e.  We don' t  

want  y o u t o  go wit h her or  
what.   Bec a us e I  want ed t o go
 with that friend because 
we wer e v e ry c l os e, a Jewish gir l.  S
he nev er cam e 
back.  She nev
er  came back.
 
Q:  So a lot of families
 were beginning 
to send their 
children away?
 
A:  Yeah, yeah.
 
Q:  But there wa sn't, I mean,
 one thing?  One day this
 happened and 
the next day 
you went into hiding?
 
A:  No, no.  No, no.
 
Q:  Tell us about 
your friend, Raphael, who beca
me, you assumed 
her identity.
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  Just tell us, im agine that 
we don't know anything about it.
 
A:  Sh e wa s v ery go o d, 
s h e was  an only daught er, s
he lik e d me and when I was

 Raphael __________. 
Ther e's  a lit t le Fr enc h t here.   And t hat' s 
it.  So my uncle, wh
en he was ta
ken away, 
liv e d wit h nuns in a c o nv ent wher e t h er
e wa s 50, 40 nuns, nob
ody knew he is  a 
man, nobody knew he is Jewish, only the 
Mot her Superior, t h e Super i or M ot her .  
The M ot h er  in c h ar ge f r om t h e whole nuns 
t h er e.  She k new that he' s a m an an d 
he's Jewish.  But the nuns
 didn't know and as
 he had black hai
r and a beard, he 
shaved four to five times a day, 
he wore the c l ot
hes as a nun.  
 
Q:  He was a nun, he pr
etended to be a woman.
 
A:  Yeah, as a wom a n and a 
nun.  So f our or fiv e t i
mes a day he would shave and 
eat only kosher.
 
Q:  What wa
s his name?
 
A:  Israel Livingston. 
 
Q:  How did he get 
int o the monast ery ?
 
A:  The woman who used t o
 work for him, t he maid, 
t h e hous e keeper, s he k new 
that monast ery, s he t a lked t o t hem  an
d when he was c l os ed in 
t h e hous e, she wen t  
through the roof and 
went into the house 
and put him on clothe
s from her husban d 

who died.  Gave him the 
identity card of her hu
sband that didn't look
 at all like him. 
And s he t o ok him by train to
 the monastery in Brussels. 
 So she put her life at 
stake, too.  And th
ey went to Br ussels and the Mo
ther Superior 
knew about him 
and t h at' s it .  And he s t ay ed ther e a y ear. 
 A full year in the monastery.  Dr essed 
and lived lik e a nun, f iv e 
t im es a day he s h av ed.
 
Q:  And he did t h is aft er t h
e Na zis had searched the ho
me and taken his wife an d 
children away?  So he 
knew he was in danger?
 
A:  No, he didn't know that 
same night, that Fr
iday night, they we
re religious people, 
they didn't know they 
coming for him.  Th
ey thought they
 coming for 
them, not for 
him, they coming for him, not
 for them.  So they said all the time, stay where yo u 
ar e, lik e hy ster ic.  He was upst air s on the 
t h ird f loor.  They wer e downst a irs .   When 
they opened the door, they
 thought somebody s
quealed on him and they looking 
for him.  Like they looked
 for me a few times when I wa
s hidden.  Bu
t it was not 
true.  They looked fo
r them and not for him, they didn'
t know he is in
 the building. 
So they took away al
l the family.  And when
 t hey s aw good f urn
it ure or good things, 
they would close from outs
ide to inside the house, 
nobody should go in.  So they 
seal the house til th
ey take out a family
.  So they sealed it
 and he was inside.
 
Q:  Let 's go back  to,  do y o u r em em ber  y o
ur  mot h er t a lking t o
 you before, the day 
befor e you went  away or t
he night?  What did she say?
 
A:  She would say, "Look, 
we have to send you away.  
It's for your own good, we 
hope to be together soon". 
 So we thought s o.  And af
t er t he war, we pr epared 1 2  
bedr ooms,  full bedr ooms, and nobody  c am e
 back.   T w ent y- eight  from t h e f am i ly  
were taken.  Close, you k
now, father's family, close, 
aunts and uncles and cousins. 
Very c los e, 28, wer e t a ken away.
 
Q:  What did y o u t ak e wit h y o
u wh en you went into hiding?
 
A:  M ay be thr e e dr es ses, t w o dres s es, 
becaus e  I us ed t o go t o chur ch ever y  
Sunday, they made me go.
  Because the people in
 the neighborhood, they 
__________ I'm a niece 
from out of town. 
 And that dress I 
would wear Sunday, 
then not h ing, a s k irt and a t o
p, may b e.  Not hing spec ial.
  My socks were all hard 
from mending, not like now,  they mended 
the socks.  I would 
need the socks, wear  
them.  And they got money fo
r m e ev ery mont h.  And onc e
 my parents were taken,  
they were worried.  The m
oney will stop.  I do
n't think they woul
d give me up or 
what , t h ey want ed t o  adopt  m e aft er t h e 
war  bec aus e t h ey  had 
a sick girl, retarded, 
they want ed to adop
t me and my  unc le didn' t  want 
me to become 
Catholic.  And 
they had respect for me, ther
e was nev er por k in t he house 
while I lived there.  But, 
they were very strict
 to me, very strict.  If I brea
k an egg, I wouldn't get an egg for 
thr ee day s.   And t he 
food was not to
o much.  When I had on
ce an accident, they  

wouldn't call a doctor because they we re 
afraid.  So, it was 
not easy when you' re 
very spoiled from home, be
cause I was very spoiled 
as  an only daught er.   And 
that's it.
 
Q:  Did you take anyt
hing from home like a doll or photographs?
 
A:  No, only the diary, only th
e diary, no jewelry.  Only 
the diary, and now I'm more 
in touc h t h an all thes e y ear s was a c ous in
 of m i ne that went last week t o the 
Holoc aust Mus e um and I 
got  a t i c ket and s he...
 
[end of s ide A of t ape one of t hr e e]
 
Q:  You were talking 
about your cousin.
 
A:  And now we got in  touch 
very much and we'r e very cl
ose again.  We
 were very 
close as children.  And she st
art e d to call here and I c a
me now and I said, "I want  
to give you that page 
from t h e diary,  if I  f ind my diar
y ".  T hen I s t arted t o look ing.  
One day I 'll giv e it t o y ou, mak e y ou a 
copy.  But she painted
 m e a sheep and she 
say, "Our  love is f orever ".  It  was the 
last thing I saw her for many, many years, 
may b e 30, 40 year s I didn't s e e,
 didn't hear.  No w she lives 
in Houston, Texas.  But 
in the wa r, no, she was in  Ec uador, she wa
sn't in Belgium.  Sh
e didn't go throug h 
anything.  And when we
 met a week ago or 
two, she didn't belie
ve that I don't get 
money from the Na zi war because we  went
 through so much, 
we said, "Ours wa s 
our daughters".  An d I told  them
, I don't know if I 
said it  in  my tape,
 I don't think, how 
they look to me and so on 
during the war, they 
were s itt ing and cry i ng.  But I  wen t  
through __________ 
losing my husband that
 I can't cry.  It's no
t good, it's healthie r 
when you cry.  But I cr ied a lot after the wa
r and then later I can'
t.  It's inside, you 
see, some people cry fa
st, but I can't.  I ju
st can't cry so fast.
 
Q:  Who gave y ou t h e diar y ?
  It was your already?
 
A:  I kept it all the time in
 t he war.   And then when I mo
v ed fr om Isr ael here t o ge t  
married,  I got married.
 
Q:  No, but I mean, how, 
when did y o u st art it?
 
A:  I started in Belgium, my pa
rent s gave it to me, like diary with a little mirror.  And I 
started to writ e, to give it 
to my friends, and they all si
gned, most are no
t there.  You 
know, children.  And then, at 
the end, in the diary, if yo
u see, it 's wr itten about my 
parent s, m y c ous in who was 
t a k en away and how I feel an
d how I,  and 
it wa s ver y  
sens it iv e.  But then when I m ade the t e a, I 
s ay, "If y ou want I gi
ve you that copy". 
So they say, "No, I want the orig
inal".  So I ga
v e t he or iginal.
 

Q:  Des cr ibe ar riv i ng at your
 new home, where was it a
nd how, what k i nd of r oo m  
did you have when y o u wer e in
 hiding?  When you we re s
ent away to a f am ily of 
your best friend?
 
A:  It wa s a bad feeling.  
It was a feeling like lost beca
us e I  always  had my  par ents  
near m e and I was s poiled a
nd lov ed and c herished.  But  th
ey trie d to be very nice, 
the man was very, very inte

pr iv at e les son in G er m an. 
 And then he put 
me by the nuns 
t o  st udy, st udied 
English and French lite
rature.  He want ed me
 only to study.  A
nd by t h e way, last  
week I wrote a letter to E
llie(ph) Vazel(ph) about som
ebody and I wrote about me 
and he wa nted me only to stud
y and know more because he
 knew a lot.  And they 
had a r et ar ded child, as I to

Englishman liv i ng t h er e, st art ed a litt le, st
arted with his wife, 
but I didn't know 
because they brought me 
up, I was at the age 15, 
16, like a little girl of seven, eight. 
He wanted me only to 
study, only to study.  And I 
must be thankful to him, th e 
languages, what I know now, 
is  all thanks to him becau
se he insisted I should 
study.

Q:  What did t he hous e  look lik e ?
 
A:  Oh, they had a bea
utiful home.  Beautif ul garden. 
 But a lot of 
shooting during 
the war  bec aus e it was  near  
a train st at ion and t hey said
 to the neighbors that I was 
a litt le s ic k  and I cannot st ay
 in a big city, so they, it
 was around 50
 miles from 
Br ussels.  They, I cannot stay 
in the city with my
 par ent s, I hav e t o ha v e fr es h a ir of 
the s u bur bs, t hat ' s the reas on 
they took me.  And they want
 me to stay with them. 
But I had a lot of, lot 
of accidents.  That being the 
first and the wo
rst accident was 
that I went to a m a n who ga
ve me an iden
tity card.  You need
 cards for food an d 
ident it y.  And I saw t h at big tr uc k  wit h
 people from the Germ
an and I couldn't hide 
and I couldn't run away.  
But inside the truck was 
a boy who knew me from  
Belg ium, from Antwerp.  And his par
ents wanted him to 
stay, __________ they 

didn't know him and they didn
't want, so he sa
id t o s o mebody in the wag on th at I 
am Jewish, not Catholic.  So
 they looked at 
me, but I had 
disappeared. 
 I wasn't 
there, s o the German look ed f o
r me after t h at in every 
house t h ey cam e, t h er e was  
maybe in the street, fi
ve like houses, villas they called 
it.  And they looked but they 
couldn't find me becau
se it took five minutes to st
ret c h between t h e t ennis ,  y o u and 
I play tennis, there is the, 
you know, wh at's in between 
us, the net, that's betwee n 
us, goes lik e that, s o when y o u tur n it t hat
 was like st eps and I 
took it up on the 
attic, I took it up.
 
Q:  Wait.  You cr
awled up a net ?
 
A:  No, t he net, we used t o 
take the net and put it here a
nd that is the att ic, I wou l d 
go up.
 
Q:  You would mak e s ort of a st air s.
 
A:  Yeah.  I  would go up t h e k i nd of st airs
, t ak e up t h e net, c l os e t he door and that  
was t h e att i c, y ou c ould not put a ladder, 
you could not put a c
hair and go up, yo u 
couldn't reach, only with that net.
 
Q:  You sort of clim bed up 
a rope net? 
   __________
 
A:  You did it .  And closed 
t he door.  I was sm all, but stayed t h er e thr e e hours .  
When I came back, I was hal
f fainted because it  wa s a 
chim ney,  like a chimney,  
you know, f or t h e c oal and s o 
I was half fainted when they 
t ook m e out fr om t h er e.  
They looked thre
e-quarter of an hour in the house.
 
Q:  And what did t h at s ound lik e 
when they were 
looking for you?
 
A:  At t he s am e mom e nt it wa
s like, just I'm going to fain
t, that I felt like I'm going 
any minute to faint because 
it was hot from the coal and
 it was hot from that going 
up in a r u s h.  It' s not t hat y ou t ak e it eas y
, you go slowly, I had 
t o mak e it in t w o  
minutes, go up, take the net, cl
ose the door from in side, it 
was all, and do
n't forget, I 
was very childish.  It's not that you' re 
gr own up and you know 
what  you do, why,  
what, when.  But at the same 
moment you do it because yo
u feel you wa nt to liv e . 
You want t o st ay alive.
  And the s ec o nd day. . .
 
Q:  Let's stay with this 
just for a second
, though.  So are 
you standing up...
 
A:  No, laying, laying.
 
Q:  Laying down.  A
nd what can you hear?
 
A:   I can hear not good bec
ause the door is closed, but I ca
n hear a litt le
.  A littl e. 
Like screaming saying, "To hell with it, where 
is she?  Isn't she 
here?"  "No".  But I  
hav e a f eeling s h e' s here.  "I s s h e here?"  
"No".  And it would go
 on and go
 on for 

half  an hour.  And you would 
s t and just her e and I am j u st
 on t op of  you.  So any  
minute I thought you'll 
find out, but you had no wa y.  
If you're sma
ller, you had no 
way to come up, becaus e it  was too na
rrow and too small an
d you couldn't come 
up.  And t h en the sec ond day fr
om that, they didn't give 
up on me.  Th
ey say they 
know that they 
have a Jewess at
 __________.  
So it we nt so fast.
 
Q:  So the Germans said 
that they were sure...
 
A:   Sure there was some 
__________ hiding a Jew.  So
 they came 
unexpected, I 
didn't have the time to go up, 
so they put me in the gard
en and t hen lik e bur i ed me.  
They put earth on
 m e and I was t here.  T h
e same time, 
the next day.
 
Q:  Oh, the next day.  Wh
o t ook y ou in t h e garden?
 
A:  My aunt, my aunt.  Th
ey digged a hole, th
ey put me in, they
 cover e d t he hole 
and t hey wer e look ing in the gar d en, but 
ther e was no s i gn, ther e was not hing, yo u 
understand?  Because ther
e wa s no sign that ther
e was somebody, there was 
plants and there was po
tatoes or something.
 
Q:  Did y ou res i st being bur ied?
 
A:  I don't know, I re
m em ber t h at I was s ic k f or t w o 
days  aft er t hat, I  was st ay ing in 
bed and I was crying all the ti
me.  Because I didn'
t know why they did it  to me.  She 
say, "It 's f or  your own good".  She was ver y
, very nice, very st
ingy, I remember, but 
very nice.  Very warm
 pers on, but st ingy , v e ry st ingy
.  That was all in one week. 
The attic, __________, and the thir d day, it 
was not finished.  
I was supposed to go 
to the man who gave me the 
identity card.  And it was 
not like from here to the 
corner, it  was not far and he 
had to change something on my
 identity card, it was in 
Raphael's name.  So he, he saw I am yo
ung and he take ad
vantage, he say, "I 
insist, you should tell me that
's your real name".  It's not 
my real name.  I say, "It's 
my real name".  __________ I wasn't so stupid. 
 An d he insisted, I wouldn't tell.  So 
then he s ay ,  you k now,  "Leav e 
me your ident it y card here. 
 Ne xt Monday, I'll give it 
to you".  And I 
had a feeling, sixt h sense,
 not to give him, I say,
 "I'll give it  to you 
Sunday".  I came 
hom e and I cr ied, I s ay, " H e want
ed t hat c ard".  
She says, "You 
didn't give it to him?"  I say, "No, I had 
a feeling not to".   Sh
e say, "My child, do 
whatever you feel".  The 
next morning she came to 
me and she hu
gged me, she 
say, "You know, they killed him".  He
 was on his way some
where and he ha d 
identity cards,  
25 or 30, and all these 
people were take
n away.  You didn't know if 
he wor k ed f or t he Ger m ans and 
f or t he Am er ic an, f or bot h.
 
Q:  __________ double?
 
A:  Double.  So they neve
r knew who killed him.  Bu
t the people we
re all taken 
away.  She wa s very, very hap
py that I didn't give him 
t h e c ard bec aus e ther e was  

the address and the name and
 the age, everything on the 
identity card
.  So sh e 
was very happy.
 
Q:  I want t o go bac k t o, I m e an,  how lit t le
 were you?  How qui
ckly could you dig a 
hole for you?
 
A:  I didn't dig it.  They digged it maybe 
t w o or t hr e e days in adv a n ce in c as e  t he y  
needed it.  They prepared
.  I didn't dig it.  No t I knew, 
not I would.  No, I didn't dig 
that hole.
 
Q:  Did you close your eyes?  Did
 they put a blanket over you?
 
A:  Nothing, nothing.  Just
 plain, yeah.  Just aliv e.
 
Q:  And how long we
re you underground?
 
A:  Maybe half  an hour she to
ld me.  But it was 
like a year.  But it
 was only a half  a 
year, a half  an hour, t h at' s 
all.  No, and I could never hav
e a doct or  lik e one time I  
made soap and I burned all my hands, here I 
have signs and they
 would not call a 
doctor.  All that boiling wa
ter and soap, we didn't ha
ve soap, so we made soap 
ourselves, they couldn
' t  c a ll t h e doctor  bec aus e t h ey  
were afraid.  The only thing is, 
I went Sunday to church and 
t h at 's all.  F or now.  She 
us ed to s a y, " Y ou pr ay for  
your God.  I know yo
u don't pray, but you pr
ay for your God".  
I say, "Not supposed 
to pray for your God in a 
church".  I said , "You have
 to go to 
a synagogue, you 
cannot  pr ay  in a c h urc h ".
  She say,  "You can".
 
Q:  Do you think that's true?
 
A:  I don't t h ink y o u c a n pray in a ch
urch for a synagogue, 
I don't think so.  
 
Q:  Who, when you say lik e af
ter you were buried aliv e, 
that y o u cr ied for t w o days ,  
who comforted yo
u?  Or did anyone touc
h you or __________.
 
A:  They comforted me, but 
not like a mother.  
Not lik e a mot her . 
 I don't know how 
you feel with your mother, 
but it  was m i ss ing bec aus e it
 was not t he c omf ort of a 
mot her .  But they t r ied t o c a
lm me down, make me calm. 
 But, it was not too strong, 
the c omf or t.  Maybe at t hat  t im e, at t
hat mom ent , going t h
rough what I went  
through, I was a little
 hard and I overcome this.  
You understand?  But, you know.  
That 's what  I did.
 
Q:  When you were in the 
hole, with the dirt on top 
of you, could you hear th e 
Germ ans look ing for y o u?
 
A:  No, but I felt li
k e, go, a c ertain m oment, it was 
like t hey go on top of me, bu t  
ot her wise, I  don't  know wher e t h ey  ar e.   Bu
t when they walk
 near me, it  felt like yo u 
walk on my head.  Bu
t that's all, but I didn't react.
  Maybe I was too weak or mayb e 

I was mixed up or ma
ybe I was anxious and nervous 
from what's happening.  They 
would say in advance, I would sa
y, "I don't accept, I won't 
do it ".  And then I did it 
bec aus e they wanted me t o do it.
 
Q:  They had war n ed you t hat
 that might happen, and you 
said, "I don't want to be 
buried?"
 
A:  No, they say, we
 might have to do that.  I say, 
"I would pr ef er t o go up in t he 
attic".  She said to wait 
and see what situat
ion will be.  Then th
e situation didn't 
come to go to the attic and th
ey had no other wa
y than to do that.  Becaus e if  they  
don't save me, they 
would be taken away to one be
cause all the __________ of the 
family, we gave some
body, and the son sque
aled on the f ather, t h ey t o ok away his  
father and all the silv
er of the family .  So  I told  her
 to __________, I r
ead it  in  the 
paper what , s o s h e said, "You 
see, God forbid if they  take
 y o u, t h ey  take us away,  
too bec a us e we want ed to sav e y ou.  So we
 als o in danger as 
m u ch as you ar e" .  
She explained to me
, she says, "So, you have to do 
what we tell yo
u to do because 
we just in danger 
like you ar e".  So
 I dec i ded t o do what s he tells m e.
 
Q:  What did y o u c a ll her ?
 
A:  Aun t .
 
Q:  What was a regular day 
like?  Did you th
ink every day, may
be the Germans will 
come looking for me? 
 May b e j ust  des cr ibe a regular day .   
 
A:  I got up in t h e mor n ing and I was, I 
was  in a v ery bad m o
od because I didn't 
know what the day is going 
to bring and they 
had a, like a maid
 who would t ak e  
car e of the daught er and t h
ey would le t me help her. 
 And t h ey would t eac h me 
how to take the dust, no
t like that, like
 that.  How to 
c l ean house.  All that what my  
mot her nev er ask e d from me.  She said, "O ne 
day you'll be on your own.  If you'r e  
rich,  y o u' ll hav e a m a id.  If y o u don't  k n ow 
what  t o do wit h y o
urself, you won't be 
able to t e ll her how t o
 do it.  So I  want  y o u t o  k now
, I want you todo it.  And then 
you can give orders to somebody
 else.  But first, you have to
 teach yourself to do it.  
You have to decide your 
own, bec aus e y ou nev er 
know, maybe you have no 
parent s one day ".  She k new t h at it  m i
ght happen.  She want
ed to prepare me 
mentally, as well as her hu
sband who, I told you, was 
very intelligent and was ver y  
realistic and he 
thought it might happen that she will 
be alone left, so
 let's prepare 
her.  But, I didn't wa nt to 
think about it.  Sometimes yo
u know it 's going to happen, 
but y o u don't  want,  y o u don't  
wa nt to think it's going to
 happen, you d
on't want to 
ac cept it.  But t hat ' s it.
 
Q:  How long did you live in
 hiding with these people?
 

A:  I lived two years.  They
 want ed, als o, af ter t h e war,  
not to give me
 back, they 
want ed t o adopt m e when m y unc l e c a
m e and st ay ed.  Bu
t t h e aunt was no t  
pleasant because she left her 
husband and went away wi
th the Englishman and for 
a long t im e  the husband t h ough
t that I had something to do
, that I  he lped her  out .  
And I didn't know, I 
was very naive.  They used 
to go everything, Monday, to 
Br ussels, and they t
ook me along, we went
 to movie, we went
 shopping, after the 
war, the wife of my
 uncle, my aunt.  And 
then one day I became 
sick, they went by 
thems e lv es , they nev e r took m e again.  They
 lik e d to be by t h em
self.  I didn't know 
why, t hey had an aff a ir , I didn't
 know what's an affair.  I didn't know what's an affair. 
So he was a litt le angr y at t
he end, he say, "I give so much
 of myself to that girl an d 
she didn't be thankful 
to me".  So my uncle said, "S
he was naive, it 's
 not that she 
was m ean or what.  Sh
e didn't understand".
 
Q:  Your uncle thought that some
how you had a role in his wife?
 
A:  The unc l e, t he non- Jew.  Yes .  
 
Q:  T he pr etend unc l e.
 
A:  T he pr etend unc l e thought I hav e a r o le
 by helping t hem to
 get toget her wh ile I  
didn't understand and I didn't want to say that on the tape
, I'll tell you later, I didn't 
understand.  That I'm helpi
ng or not, I didn't gras
p, I wasn't like that.
 
Q:  Were you able to
 hear anything about 
your parents during,
 when you first 
mov e d in wit h t hes e people who hid y o
u?  Did you keep in t ouc h at all?
 
A:  A week or t w o, t hat ' s 
all.  A week or t w o.  T wo 
weeks, that's 
all, not more.
 
Q:  So how did they  k e ep in t o uc h?
 
A:   The people who lived nex
t door to us would call 
him at work, my uncle, my 
pretend uncle, but th
en they stopped callin
g.  And when they we
re taken away, and 
the money finis h ed, ev ery t hr e e months t h
ey paid for me, they
 paid money, they 
should keep me.  So  she us
ed to say to me, "How wi
ll we get the money?"  
Because they also took me 
a lot because of the money 
they needed, naturally.  So 
the m an,  the owner f r om th
e apar tment, non- Jew, used 
to send the money ev ery 
thr ee mont hs like bef o re.  His own m oney.
 
Q:  A friend of your father?
 
A:  No , the owner of the ap
artment where we lived, my 
parents, he sent his own 
money because he said later,
 he was afraid maybe I'll 
give me up or what and he 
send the money every three mo
nths.  And we in touch wi
th his son, he's dead.  His 
son is in touc h and 
he would s ay the nic est t h ing in
 ev ery letter for Christmas an d 
New Year  t hat he wr it es  me
, "My father didn't 
save you to go to
 a country wh ere 

there is war all t he t im e.  M y
 father didn't save 
you".  Ever y year 
he wr it es me the 
same sent ence.  A nice man,
 he's  around m y  age and he' s nic e.  We us ed t o  play  
when we were 
young and he's very nice
, he wr it es me very nice letters.  And such 
kind of people I like
 get in touch and lik
e to be in  touch.
 
Q:  So how long was it
 after you went into hiding th
at your parent
s were deported?
 
A:  Half a year, four 
months.  Four months.
 
Q:  How did you hear abou
t t h at ?  Who t o ld y ou?
 
A:  A long time after that th
ey told me.  They didn't tell
 me t h at when  it was fr es h ,  
months after that, they
 didn't want me to k
now, they didn't know
 what reaction I will 
have and they didn't know
.  They didn't tell me 
that when it was fresh.
 
Q:  When they did tell yo
u t h e st or y, who t o ld you?
 
A:  My aunt, my aunt.  
It was Raphael, yeah, Raphael to
ld  her a few days after 
because she didn't live far aw
ay, but she told me.  She fi
rst prepared me a little an d 
she say, you know, "They're 
deporting a lot of Jews from
 Antwerp", and they would 
never had been d
eported so fast if not that wom
an bec a us e in the s t reet wher e we 
lived, was two Jews, a man and
 a family and we, 
like I told you, it
 was not a Jewis h  
neighborhood.  But if not th
at woman, maybe they will 
stay til after the war or 
may b e a f e w m ont hs , but it was not a 
Jewish neighborhood and
 all the people 
knew each other and they wo
uld never squeal like she did.
  Sh e really squealed on 
them.
 
Q:  How do you know what happen
ed, how did y o u get t h e det ails ?
 
A:   Somebody after the war 
told my uncle that
 they were taken to Au schwit z an d 
that's it.  That's it.
 
Q:  But the story that you te
ll, for instance, abo
ut your brother hiding, how did you...
 
A:  T her e was t h at wom an on t h e t h ird f loo
r, was like, how do 
you say, easy, easy 
going, and aft er the war went
 t o her off ic e and suddenly 
I feel a wo man giving me a 
slap on the face 
and shouting and ____
______ and everybody 
turns around.  She 
didn't k now that I 'm alive and t hat  I wa
s hidden and she, wh
en t he Germ an came,  
want ed t o tak e, lik e I t o ld you, m y  brot
her, hid him under her 
bed, didn't wa nt.  So 
she knew and she saw 
when they were taken away, sh
e told me ever
ything then.
 
Q:  She hit you?
 
A:  She got  so exc it e d,  ner vous, s he didn't
 k now that I was aliv e and at t he same 
mom ent , s he r em em b er ed t h at s he wanted to
 s av e m y  brot her and he didn't want  
to stay with her, so she was so, I don't  
know how to say in En
glish, she was very, 

she was out of hers elf seeing me in t her e, 
it  was not that she hi
t me from anger or 
what , she was s o, s h e c ouldn' t  believ e that it
's me in the stair.  If I, it would be 20, 
30 year s y ou can c hange, but 
t h at was thr e e, four y ear
s, so I didn't change so 
muc h in t he four year s,  that
 she didn't r ec o gnize m e.  
And I was with my uncle, my 
uncle didn't unders
t and, t o o, and then s he exc us e d 
her self,  we went t o dr ink a c u p 
of coffee and she ex
plained.   And she told us that an
d t h en at night,  the sam e  night,  
I was v ery hy st er ic al.  And what my unc le
 did t o c a lm me do
wn, but I was very, I 
knew they not coming back, 
but the way she told us in
 there, it was reopen the 
wound they call it.  
It was like reopening a 
wo und.  That's it.
 
Q:  But also maybe helpin
g t o clos e it, poss ibly.
 
A:  Yea h.
 
Q:  You were gett i ng s om e inf orm at io
n that you didn't 
necessarily have.
 
A:  It was bad informa
t ion and you want ed to k now,  
so it's both together, you 
understand?  It wa s in fo
rmatio n, good and no
t good.  It can be sad,
 if  it 's good or  
not good.
 
Q:  When were you t o ld t h at y o ur par e nt
s were deported?  Ho
w old were you, do 
you remember?
 
A:  Ar ound 16, 16.
 
Q:  Aft er about a y ear  or t w o?
 
A:   Yeah.  No, when 
I was, a m onth or t w o af ter t hey
 wer e deport ed.   Wh en I hear d 
they wouldn't come bac k, we us ed t o ha
ve 13 bedrooms and t
hen every two days 
my uncle would sell anot her bedr oom be
cause he saw there 
is nothing, nobody 
com i ng bac k.  And we had 
saved a few apartments from 
the family, we had a bi g 
house with a lot of bedroo
ms.  So  every night I woul
d come back, there would be 
anot her bedr oom  f or me.  Se
e and it was very demoraliz
ing, very.  
And then my 
unc l e took his pac kage and went  to Sout
h Amer ic a.  And I st ayed in Belgium.
 
Q:  Who t o ld y o u t hat t hey had been 
deported?  I mean
, where were you?
 
A:  I was with my 
uncle and it was...
 
Q:  Pr etend uncle?
 
A:  No, no.  It was my real
 uncle, after the war and t
hey, I don't remember, it was 
som e fr iends of my unc l e that t hey hear d 
from somebody else th
at was in the camp 
with my parents.  And they 
saved themself.  There was a 
few, very few, people that 
came back from Au schwit z, 
not many.  Maybe if my br
other wouldn't have gone in 
the line for my father, beca
use they took younger people 
separate, he 
would have 

lived, but he wa nted only to 
be with my father, he
 was v ery c l os e t o  my f ather.  And 
he was young, t h ey would have
 kept him, they would put him to work or, but h e  
didn't want.
 
Q:  He was like your father who stayed with his father .
 
A:  Yeah.  Maybe.
 
Q:  I just want to get this clear, though.  When 
were you, you weren'
t told right away 
that they were deport
ed, who told you that
 and wer e you st ill, 
y ou must hav e stil l 
been in hiding? 
 T hat t hey had left  your home.
 
A:  O h, t hat was m o nt hs  af ter,  t w o m o nt hs
 after I was hiding. 
 My pretend aunt. 
Yeah.  The man, who later on
 paid for me, must have call
ed or writt en t o her abo ut 
that.  And if I didn't get any mail, I neve
r looked at the 
mail, understand.
 
Q:  What did it m ean, did y o u k now t h en 
t h at they had been 
sent to Auschwit z?
 
A:  No, no, no.  I knew they
 were deported, but 
at that time we di
dn't know wh at and 
when or Auschwit z, no, we
 didn't know.  Didn't know
.  Some of 
the people who 
went to Auschwitz, I read a 
lot about it, didn't know.  
They didn't kn
ow.  But, like 
again, I tell you, if  they would have, if  
they would take me, 
t h ey would t a ke m y  
pretend aunt and uncle becaus
e there were a lot of people 
that happened to them. 
And some Jews squealed on 
other Jews, like that boy 
who wanted to squeal on 
me.  He said, "Why should 
I go, why shouldn't she come
?"  I don't know what an 
interest, I wouldn't do it  be
cause why should I take yo
u?  It's enough I, but people 
ar e s e lf is h so t h ey want y o u 
t o be in t he s am e s it u at ion.. .
 
End of Tape 1.
 

 Tape2
 
Q:  Th is is  an int er v ie w wit h An n y  K as
t, K- A- S- T, c onduct ed by Kat ie Dav i s  on 
August 5 in  Silv er Spring, Ma
ryland.  This is tape numb
er two, side A.  Did, was 
your friend, Raphael
, whose papers you had, you were
 pretending to
 be Raphael, 
was she ev er able t o c om e v i sit y ou dur i
ng that time that 
you were in hiding?
 
A:  I  think she was t h
ere once, that's all. 
 Yeah.  Because they
 tried not to hav e  
people over, they say they br
ought over their niece, me
, and they didn't want. 
Bec a us e s he was als o a c h ild, s he can s a y  
som et hing that s h e s ho u ldn't or what . 
Neighbors and it wa s not, no
t recommended.  Probably that
's what the aunt said, I 
will have to ask 
when I see her, God will
, how many times or 
if she came
.  But I 
don't think more th
an once, if I remember well
, but I'll have to ask her.
 
Q:  Did you ever feel someti
mes, you're a young girl, di
d they actually call you 
Raphael?  Did they say, Raph
ael, when they called you?
 
A:  No, when there 
was no one strange, they wouldn
't call me, my 
name is Anny, 
they wouldn't  c a ll m e Anny, t h ey  would 
c a ll me a shor t cute
 name, Annime(ph), 
that' s my Anny, but if you would be t h
ere or a str a nger, t h ey would c a ll me ,  
Jeanine(ph).  Sh e changed 
my name from Raphael, J
eanine to Raphael.  My 
name,  at  hom e and at  sc hool
 was Jeanine, it was a Fr
ench name.  
And then sh e 
changed it  when she went 
to France and she wants onl
y to be called Raphael. 
Must be that her real name
 now is  officially Raphael, 
because when I send her a 
check I wr it e Raphael, too.
  So it must be.  
 
Q:  So was there ever
 a time when you felt like telli
ng people, I'm 
Anny Kast, I'm 
not, was there ever 
just a rebellious...
 
A:  Anny Rubenstock(ph).
 
Q:  Anny Rubenst ock.
 
A:  No, never talked.  No, you see, that 
man wa nted to know, 
I never told, because 
she told me, "Never tell anyone.  Yo
u are Jeanine __________,
 and that's it. 
Nobody ever has to know that".
  She nev er, she didn't let 
me and I didn't do it.  An d 
I went t o t he nuns  f o r the English less
on or what, s om et ime
s they would say, 
"Jeanine".  I would look, I wouldn't know, 
you know?  It reminds 
me they wanted to 
take me in Israel 
to the __________ and spy.  After 
the war when I ca
me to Israel 
because I know language and I 
we nt through so mu
ch.  So one of 
my friends spok e 
to somebody abou
t spie s, so that man came 
and he asked me, would I be 
interest ed t o be in a, woul
d I be interest ed t o be in 
anot her count r y and wor k for  
Israel?  I s ay, " Y es ".  T hey went  thr o ug
h with all t he,  now I d
on't like to 
go to a 
doctor, I went to docto
rs for months, I went 
to psychiatr ist s, I we
nt to everything. 

But when did I fall through?  
When they say if I knew t o 
hold a gun,  I say, " N o" .  I 
say __________.  But they woul
d go and find out who ar
e my friends, what's my 
family, they went  in the ba
ckground.  But then
 when the called the hospit al, they 
called my name,  I don't  reme
m b er what  it was, I  jum p
ed up, I for
got  it' s my ,  
bec aus e I didn't go t o my nam e.   They di
dn't want me to know. 
 It reminds me when 
they said, "Jeanine" in sch
ool, I looked like, it's not 
me.  And the teacher says, 
"Jeanine".  And oh
 yeah, it's me.
 
Q:  You had a photograph wi
th you.  You did have a 
photograph __________ didn't 
you?
 
A:  At that time, yeah.
 
Q:  Who gave it to you?
 
A:  I don't remember.  I d
on't have one picture from my
 brother, not one.  I don't 
hav e it.  That' s it.
 
Q:  Do you still ha
v e t h e phot ograph 
of y our  parent s?
 
A:  Yeah.  I have of my
 parents __________,
 my mother, she 
was a beautiful 
woman, t h at' s m y m ot her.  I t ' s  beaut i
f u l, no?  Yeah.  They s a y s he dr es sed 
beautiful and she wa
s a beaut iful woman.
 
Q:  This is in
 the 20's maybe?
 
A:  Pr obably.  But look at t he c l othes.
 
Q:  Gorgeous.
 
A:  The long c l ot hes.
 
Q:  Yeah, it's very long.
 
A:  Yeah, t h at' s what  they wor e t hen.
 
Q:  Do you thin k your 
father made that coat?
 
A:  No, no, no.
 
Q:  No.  Do y ou r e mem ber , what did y o
u, what was your 
idea of what  wa s  
happening to people wh
en they were 
deported?  Did you have
 any sense of what  
was r eally going on?
 
A:  Nobody  had a s ense.  At that  tim e
, nobody had a s ens e, 
nobody knew.  They 
didn't talk  about it  so
 muc h, t h ey  didn't k now t h at, we
 knew it 's not 
good, it 's not a 
good sign because I 
was reading.  I will tell you 
an example, my 
aunt, __________, 

her mother was English, Polis
h and her step-father wa s En
glish, she was 82 years, 
very religious man, she 
was 45.  She marr ied him 
for his money.  Really. 
 
Q:  __________.
 
A:  My aunt 's mot h er, my aunt, r eal aunt. 
 M y f ather 's  brot her ' s wif e.  And t he ma n 
was 82, extremely religio us
, the woman had only one 
daughter, my
 aunt, and 
wanted to leave when she w
ould die, everything her daught
er.  So she married that 
man to be rich.  And I was sitting by my
 aunt, make belie ve, 
and I had a paper,  t he 
Belg ium, __________ wa s a German, went in
 the house where she lived, cut her 
tongue and made him a cr
ipple, and t h ey bot h died.  I 
read it in t h e paper, my aunt  
never would have known.  
I gave her the paper years 
later.  So, 
__________, got 
the money and she marr
ied that man at age 43, 82.  
I remember as 
a child, he had 
a whit e beard, he was a v er y
 old man.  Yo u know, when
 you are 15, 14, 13, and a 
man of 82, an ant i que,  but it
 wa s also a for her, she wa
s 42 year s,  she m arr ied a 
man of 84.  Just for the 
money and then he
 died,  s h e died,  
she never got the 
money.  She had to st ay with a man so ol
d.  So, and then, yo
u know, a man 82 was 
old, now it 's not th
e same, but  then, es pec i ally a r e
ligious and the 
beard and the...
 
Q:  Do you remember 
beginning to hear or
 think maybe the Ge
rmans are going to 
be defeated?
 
A:  We heard about it
 and t hey bombarded a lot of t he 
time, the little town where we 
were near the train and t h ey
 bombarded, we were all t
he time hiding
 out in th e 
cellar.  And dur ing the bomb
ar dm ents, t he end of t he wa
r, and we say maybe the 
problems will be solv ed.  
We didn't know, you know, 
maybe the people will com e  
back.  Maybe, the probl
ems will be solved, let'
s put it this way.  
But, we didn't know 
what to expect.  No, you 
didn't know.  Yo u didn't k
now wh at's going to be and 
what's going to happ
en.  Not at all.
 
Q:  Tell us about when 
things changed, when the 
Germans wer e def eated.
 
A:  W h en t hey were def eat ed, s o  my mak e 
believe aunt went wi
th me to the nuns 
and told them that I was Jewish, but I likedtheir behavior and that
 I studied we ll and 
they helped me a lot in life 
and I went then and
 I bought a big plan
t, flowers for the 
Mother Superior, wh o was very
 nice to me.  We were 
happy.  Becaus
e t hey nev er  
knew, she nev er t o ld 
them.  It was nice.
 
Q;  What did they say?
 
A:  They were stunned at firs
t, they looked and they didn
't really belie ve that they 
did s uc h a t h ing bec ause t h ey knew as well 
as she, if  I would ha
ve been taken, the 
same would happen to he
r.  She, they knew it  and sh
e knew it all along.  But she 
has t o hide me but s he has t o hi
de that she has 
me in her house.
 

Q:  How long did s he wa
it before the Germ an
s were defeated to 
do that?  Did she 
feel c onfident r i ght aft e rwar ds ?
 
A:  I think she wait ed about a week or wha
t, something, to tell 
t h em.  And t o te l l  
them this whole s t or y  and 
m y par ent s wer e tak en away
 and we don't know what 
happened, what will happen with
 me because we didn't hear
 yet from my uncle th at 
he was alive and she said  to
 the nuns, "I'll be
 com i ng",  because 
she wants to adopt 
me.  You understand that th
at's a decision that she 
and her husban
d made, but 
nothing c a me out.  
 
Q:  Do y ou remem b er,  was ther e lik e a very
 dist inct ive mem ory 
from liberation, of 
Allied troops?
 
A;  Oh, yeah.
 
Q:  Tell us about that.
 
A:  It was something very, very plea
sant, the whole town  and everybody. 
Es pecially, I wa s extremely, extremely h
appy  and jovial, how do 
you say, because I  
knew maybe I will see my par
ents soon and my brother, my
 family, so it wa s my 
wish.  Ev erybody had anothe
r wish, to see th
eir beloved or wh
at, but I, I just 
thought about that, that soon
, __________ to me 
I will go to my pa
rents, that they 
will be better than her. 
 You understand?  But 
it took time.  Then
 after a few weeks, 
my uncle came and, we
ll, he came from the nuns and
 he had taken his house back. 
 
Q:  Who had been in the hous e?
 
A:  Nobody.
 
Q:  Okay.
 
A:  They had taken out a lo
t,  t h e G erm an fur n itur e,  go
od things, antiquit ies, but

the floor, that she lost.  
__________  So, a m
illion and a half childr
en they killed ,  
what do you want. 
 A million and a half.  That's a lot.
 
Q;  So y o u went in t h e hous

wouldn't cook on Saturday.  And 
that pot was on the, you know
, it's like you leave now al
l dead and I co
me back and 
see f o ur empty glas s es while
 nobody lived here.  Who we
r e the f our p e ople?  W ho 

dr ank from  that.  So it 's 
a very,  very unpleas ant f ee
ling.  So t h en, when I  met  
people, they didn't 
go through nothi
ng, they stayed with 
their husband 
and children 
and they s av e d t h ems e lf, t h ey 'r e gett in
g money f r om  G erm any and how m uc h yo u 
want .  So it  hurt  me.   Bec a us
e I say, even if  I wouldn't n
eed the money I'll
 give it  to 
Raphael, but it should co
me to me more than
 to you that you had
 your family, you 
stay ed all over t h e war wit h y o ur f a
mily .  T h at ' s a big plus .  Right?  
 
Q:  Do you, what was it like
 when you first saw your uncle?
 
A:  It was a good feelin
g, good f eeling.  But, I still, at 
that time, I suff ered a lot from 
my ey es , I  cr ied a lot,  I cr ie
d day and night.  And I came 
to my uncle and I say, "I 
want t o see y o u, but  I want
 to see my parents".  Th
e he t o ok me t o s ee m y  
gr andm ot her who s pent all the war in t he 
hospital, I told you 
and cam e o ut.  She 
was the first funeral, Jewish funeral in An
twerp when she died.  
But before she died 
and I us ed to c om e to her, 
s he was a litt le m i xed up, bu
t still she would say, "Why  
doesn't your father come 
to see his mother
, why do you c om e  to s ee m e ? "  
Under st and?  She didn't gr as p t h e s it u at ion.
  I didn't know then.  But she was the 
first funeral, my uncle was ve
ry upset.  So, he 
said,  "If  you don't st
op crying, I'll put 
you in wit h your gr andmot her  bec aus e y o u 
have to stop crying".
  But some people 
can cry when they're told  enough.
  It's a thing that
's in side.  Or you cry or you don't 
cry, r i ght ?
 
Q:  It sounds like you did cry.
 
A:  Oh, a lot.
 
Q:  You cried.
 
A:  Cr ied a lot.
 
Q:  Cr ied y ours e lf out.
 
A:  Yeah.  Now, when my hus
band died, I cried a little bit, 
I can't cry and that's bad. 
I envy these people who cr
ying, crying, crying, for 
no reason.  And when you 
__________, you cry, it's
 good.  It's 
very healthy th
ey told me.
 
Q:  So what did your uncle 
say?  I mean, obviously, w
hat did you uncle say about 
your parent s?  And t h
en wh at might happen?
 
A:  He didn't know at the time
.  He didn't know.  
He only said, "Let's hope they come 
back".   At that t im e, t here was still a 
lot of hope.  You und
erstand?  Everybody 
hoped it will go okay.
 
Q:  So you didn't go, did you 
ev er go t o your  fam i ly apar
tment?  You were in your 
uncle's house, but did you 
ev er go t o t he apartm ent 
where you lived with your 
family?
 

A:  I went to these people who 
paid for me and I wa s 
very nice to them
.  What a gift.  
And my uncle paid them back 
for all t hes e year s that t h
ey paid, you 
know, they 
were very nice.  I w
ent to say hello to th
em.  But it was a half  a y e ar aft er I st ay ed 
with my uncle.  And all my 
friends started to go out, ha
ve a good time
 and I never 
had a good time.  Be cause I 
worked.  My uncl
e opened a store 
in Belgium and I  
used to sell the American
, the Englis h, [phone ri
nging, pause
 in tape].
 
Q:  So it was just y o ur unc l e and y ou?
 
A:  Yeah.  No, it was, afte
r that, came a nephew
 from his wife, fr
om Treblinka.  And 
he was Polish and didn't 
know Belgium, bu
t he heard somebo
dy is  _________ _  
and he stayed with 
us.   And my unc l e when to 
South America, he wa nt ed 
everything, everything.  He  
came back from Treblinka 
wher e he saved h i mself.  
And t h at 's it .  He c am e lik e fr om nowher e.
 
Q:  Did he talk ab
out what it was like in Treblinka?
 
A:  I don't re
member because he 
used to talk very badly Jewis
h, a lot of lot of Polish 
and I didn't know a word of 
Polis h.  But  he spok e v ery  
little.   When
 he came, he 
weigh maybe, he was maybe like that.  So
 lat er he gained weight and he bec am e  
more person.  But when he
 c ame he was v er y depr ess e d and m y unc l e helped him  
a lot.  But otherwise, it wa
s t h e t w o of us, t h at 's all.
 
Q:  Ho w, tell us again how you finally rea
lly heard about your 
parents.  When that 
was and how you heard wh at happened.
 
A:  I tell you, I heard that
 t hey wer e t ak e n away a f e
w wee ks  aft er  I 
was hidden. 
And then only aft er the war ,  a mont h or
 two, maybe later,
 they started t o  
__________ us that peopl
e were killed and gassed and so
 on.  Before that, people 
didn't know, we didn't know wh at happened
.  Then we were, st
arted to understand 
and t o know.  
 
Q:  What were your 
thoughts when you fi
rst heard this story?
 
A:  My thought was 
that it happened, but 
not maybe to them.  
At that point, and 
__________ very self ish, but 
I thought, no, it didn't happen
 to them.  It happened, 
but not t o t hem.  See,  you d
on't r ealiz e that it can happ
en t o your own, t o o.  You 
th in k it 's o n l y to
, that's all. 
 
Q:  A n d wh o wa s it wh o t o
ld y ou, who was ther e in Aus c h witz wit h t hem?
 
A:  A fr iend of my  unc l e 
came back who 
saved himself.
 
Q:  Tell us who he was.
 

A:  I didn't know the man,
 it 's a man who knew my un
cle and who came back and 
who said that he had been
 wit h my par e nts  and m y 
br ot her,  and he k n ows t hey  
gone.  He knows.  
How the man saved hims
elf or what, I don't 
remember, I can't tell 
you.  But he saved himself.
 
Q:  And did he tell 
t h e stor y of how...
 
A:  My unc l e nev er t o ld m e
.  Maybe he didn't want to 
hurt me or ma
ybe he didn't 
want me to know or anyway, 
in short, he never told me 
specifically what, when an d 
how.  He didn't.  I th
ink he didn't want it.
 
Q:  You think he knew?
 
A:  I think he knew.  
More than he
 told me.
 
Q:  Did you wa
nt to know?
 
A:  Yeah, I as ked a 
few times and I insist ed a few ti
mes, and he wo
uld change the 
subj ect and tell me, "O ne day s
oon I'll tell you more if I 
know.  If I meet a man".  But 
I didn't ask, I know my
 uncle, he asked, but he didn't 
want t o,  didn't want m e to as k,  
you understand?  
 
Q:  This was your 
father's br ot her?
 
A:  Br ot her ,  right.  
 
Q:  Did he know how his 
wife and children __________.
 
A:  Yeah.  Also, some
body told him and
 how they, it  was his father, his wife, his two 
children and his parents-in
-law.  They had another 
daughter who was pregnant 
seven mont hs  who went
 to France, they went to the 
Fr anc e t h at wa

 everything and she 
pregnant, walk ing hours at ni
ght, they were shot.  A

25, I don't know.
 
Q:  How did y ou f eel towar d s, did you ev

d c o llabor ated wit h  
the Naz is ?  For instance, t h e f am i ly t h at 
squealed, as you say,

family?
 
A:  No.  We didn't...
 
Q:  __________
 
A:  I never saw them, 
I never saw them.  An
d then when I c ame 
after the war, that 
woman and that m a n that wer e wit h th

underground, th
ey say they had moved shortly afte
r my parents were taken away. 

May b e t hey  wer e af raid, I do

Q:  Did y ou, wer e y o u ev er able to go back 
int o y our house, t he house y o u gr ew u p  
in with your
 parents, an
d get anything?
 
A:  Oh, no.  They
 had some things, but people they
 never gave ba
ck.  And the  
strangers that I came 
to wouldn't let 
me in.  No.  And meet my
 sister-in-law, Patty. 
 
Q:  Hi.  So you went to 
the hous e wher e y ou gr ew up
 and wh o was living there?
 
A:  Strangers, people.  That
 I never met, they 
didn't know me an
d wouldn't let me 
in.  T h e owner of t h e hous e, 
I stayed a while with him, he
 say he can't  
ask them, if  
they don't want.  So  I wen
t.  But I went to this neighbor
, who wanted to save my 
br other, and s h e ac c e pt ed me really, t h e 
one who wanted to 
slap my face.  She 
was very nice.  She didn't slap my face
 bec aus e she was m ean or  what, it was a 
kind of  exc i tem ent  a
nd surprise to see me. 
 You know?  If you th
ink t h at pers on is  
no more and suddenly yo
u find out the person is ther
e, it 's a very big, it  was 
something she'll neve
r  forget as long as s he liv es.
  She wa s an 
old wom a n t hen,  
she m u st be dead, but she was ver y, and
 then it's her na
ture, she was very 
excitable in general, 
I remember  as a child
, so when she saw me and that uncle of  
mine, she,  she got  s o  hyst er ic
al,  I' ll never  f or get  as  long
 as I live how hysterical. 
From happiness.  
 
Q:  Tell us what it was li
ke to see your best friend
, Raphael __________, wh o you, 
whose identit y you assumed. 
 What was it like to se
e her for the first time?
 
A:  It was, it's a pity yo
u don't know Fr enc h, ot her wise 
I would send yo
u copies, she 
wr ot e m e like, now t h at m y 
husband died, and she wr it es 
to me very often.  The 
way s he  writ es,  s h e wr it es 
very well.  She has nobody, 
no sister, no brother, no 
nothing.  And s h e' s very, v e
ry, very warm and close to me
.  She, f or da
ys and days, 
she wouldn't leav e m e.   She'
d come to m y unc l e ev ery da
y in t h e mor n ing and st ay  
til at night bec a us e s he was s o happy t o s
ee me and be with me
 and that.  And sh e 
loved Israel.  We went to 
the Hilton in Jerusalem and my
 husband wa nted to stay 
overnight.  She wa nts 
to go to a kibbu
tz.  She does
n't want  to st ay.  Very simple, 
but very nice, very nice.  An d she happe
ned to be a very
 intelligent girl that her life 
changed now, but she wa s over-excit ed so 
in 1960 my aunt _
_________ went to 
Nice in Fr ance and she took care of 
her house, bec
ause with a la ke and a 
swim ming pool and everything 
in Nice.  And I lived in Is
rael and s h e wanted me t o  
com e.  She told t h e m an, "I n c as e y o u want  
me to take care of 
the house, there is  
condition that I have to bring her over, I wa
nt to see her for six 
weeks".  So I went 
there,  ev er ybody in I sr ael thought , s he must
 be rich, she goes to Nice for vacation 

for six weeks.  It was a luxu
ry then.  Now,  everybody 
travels, but then it was a 
luxury .  And s h e inv ited Raph
ael, too, for six weeks.  Bu
t she wouldn't take a cent 
from m e, y ou k now, s he love
s me.  But s he would t ak e 
fr om my niec e.  So I  
rem ember, I paid f or t h e niece.
 
Q:  What did you talk about when she, when
 you first saw her after being in hiding 
and she was spending so 
much time 
__________.
 
A:  I was telling her, I was te
lling her wh at I went
 thr o ugh and t hat her au nt was  ver y 
nice to me.  Sh e wa
s very, very, very st
ingy, very demandin
g I should learn and 
study and do and kept me bu
sy all the time.  And she sa
id, "I know, that's the 
reason I never wanted to 
live with her".  But, thank
 God, she say, she did 
som et h ing f or y o u.  And s h e was happy and
 she's happy til now 
whe n I wr it e he r a  
lett er.  And when I was  sick and m y hus b an
d died, she would call
 me from France 
and I srael t w ic e a week and s he r eally c a n'
t afford it.  
So, and she came
 to Israel, 
she took out a hundred dollar b
ill and she said to my hus
band, "Can you change it 
in Israeli money?"  He said
, "What do you need money fo
r?  Anny  pays for you". 
"No, no, no.  I want to get 
her a gift".  He  says, "She 
doesn't need it". 
 So we gave 
her cash when she left, a few hundred 
dollars, she wouldn't 
take,  she says she 
want s a chec k.  She' s  so pr imitiv e, a c h
eck she won't lose, t
he money she'll lose, 
may b e y o u want t o buy  som et h ing.   She'
s ver y, but s h e' s  not 
demanding, oh, she' s 
so nice.  She's very ar tistic
.  She wr ot e to Belgium t o a 
f r iend of her s who paint s, to 
paint me a scarf, hand paint
 on silk.  She would send it
 fr om Belgium  t o Fr anc e, 
from F r anc e s he would s end it t o me.  
Ver y art i st ic.  And I s a y,  "What do you 
want ?"  She wants a St ar of
 Dav i d.  So I s e nd her wit h
 som e body ,  a St ar of Dav i d 
with a gold chain.  So when
 she came to Israel, she say,
 " C an I hav e a s i lv er Dav i d 
St ar?"  "Why?"  "One
 f or t h e week end and one f or t h e 
week".  So, but she is a very 
good, ver y warm per s o n,
 very warm person.
 
Q:  Did you stay in 
touch wit h your pr et end aunt and unc l e?
 
A:  I told you.  After the 
war, she left him f or 
the Englishm an.  An
d he wa s a little  
angr y t h ink i ng t hat  I had so
mething to do.  Wh
en my uncle called
 him and wr ote to 
him a few times because 
he wanted him to 
be on good, on good 
terms with me, but 
it wa s hard to make him belie
ve that I didn't know.  He 
told him, she was innocent, 
she was v ery naiv e and so 
on.  An d he wouldn't accept
 it, wouldn't accept it  
because he was a very
, ver y cultivat ed, ser i ous m a n,
 while that Englishman was 
very prim it ive.  And that's t
he end.  And it 's a pity he di
dn't believe my
 uncle or me 
that I had not hing t o do wit h 
that.   And t hat ' s  it.  And s h
e us ed to wr it e t o m e  aft er 
the war and s he us ed to be in
 touch with me, want ing to 
know what I do and s o  on,  
but that's it.

have asked, they would have 
helped and I would have a g
ood thing to 
go on in th e  
world.  I could use it  anywhere
 I want.  But I didn
't do it.  So, in

But it  happened to

so he gav e m e t h e j o b.
  And he kept me, I 
didn't work too hard, just ma

good wi th his daughte
r  that died.  She was a beauty
, she wa s a beauty.  Her name

So, my uncle wanted

 family wanted
 me t o stay 
in Ur uguay.  But 
I said a condition is  if
 I can work and keep up
 and just co

week end to you.  No, they want m e to st

the lending library 
and that was too m a ny hours  
from eight in the morning to
 seven at night.  So I

them to come.  If they w

 bec aus e then in Pales t ine

you go after it  had 
been declared a state?
 
A:  Yea h.
 
Q:  Okay.
 
A:  Yeah, I  went aft er it wa
s a st at e.  I liked it v er y mu
ch, I liked my 
family.  But I 
found it a har d lif e to live, 
it was hard.  It was very, very 
p r im it ive at tha t
 time.  But, I 
felt good with my fa
mily and in  the coun
try.  I j ust did.
 
Q:  What did y o u s p eak?
 
A:  I couldn't talk 
to them.  My cousin 
didn't know any Yiddis
h, he knew Hebrew, 
and I didn't know it.  Didn'
t know any English.  So, we
 spoke broken Yiddish, my 
uncle and me.  But then, with
 the time, I learned the langua
ge from the street lik e  
they say.  And then
 I went to a boarding school 
for  six m o nt hs  and I lear ned 
Hebrew.  And my Spanish, French is better 
than my Hebrew, but 
it 's okay.  I know 
how to talk.
 
Q:  Did t hey, did t h ey rem i nd y ou of y o ur 
m ot her ?  Did they seem  lik e her, t heir  
manner ism s?
 
A:  Yeah, yeah, no, no, they
 looked a little like my mo
ther, they woul
d always ask 
me quest ions  and s o on.  But,  t h ey  were no
t, they had another kind
 of life than we 
had in Belgium.  And then I w
ent to, nearly ever
y year  and a half  or  s i x mo nt hs , to 
Sout h Am er ic a t o m y fam ily.  Bec aus e 
they want ed me t o
 be t h er e.  And 
__________ the uncle who was wi
th me, lives in 
Israel, and my th
ree other uncles 
liv e in Sout h Am er ic a.
 

Q:  Your uncle...
 
A:  The, yeah, he lives in Israel.
 
Q:  He's still alive?
 
A:  Yeah.  He's
 old, he's losing
 his strength.
 
Q:  What is hi
s name again?
 
A:  Israel(ph).
 
Q:  He must be a fascinating man.
 
A:  Yes.  He's very nice.
 
Q:  T h is was y o ur m other 's br other ?
 
A:  No, my  f at her ' s br ot her.
 
Q:  Your f at her' s brot her.
 
A:  Right .
 
Q:  Yeah.  I just had a question, I have 
so many questions.  
Where do you feel 
home is ?
 
A:  I'll tell you the trut h, I 
f e el good here wit h  the c h ildr
en of m y s is t er- i n- law,  but I  
feel bett er  in I srael bec a us e I  hav e a lo
t of friends now and 
I have my family, 
mostly, feel better, j ust
 that lif e is a litt le har der.  
Even now, wit h all the c omf ort  that  
you hav e, you hav e a lot of c omf ort lik e be
fore, used to work 
without air condition 
and it  wa s hotter than here.  
But now, everything is  beau
tiful now and it's good. 
And people say, "You're not afraid?"  An d 
I'll tell you on th
at ans w er, y o u nev er  
know wher e t o be afr a id bec a
use I had a very g
ood fr iend, by t h e 
way, who lived in 
Israel and her s on f i nished 
college here.  And 
he came back to 
Israel and they 
didn't want him to 
go to the army becaus
e maybe he'll be killed 
or what, God forbid. 
So they moved to Ne
w York and in a few,  many 
year s ago, t her e was s om et hin g 
near the, near the, some people went in 
in the lunch room and
 they killed some 
people.  And if you will reme
mber a few years 
ago, and he wa s on
e of them.  His 
wife was pregnant eight mont
hs.  So he wa s killed.  
Maybe he would have made 
the army  and not  be k illed.   
So y o u cannot be afr a id bec a
us e it  won't help y ou.   And 
you can't liv e in a c ount r y, ev ery m i nu
te you be afraid or you'll get crazy. 
 
Q:  Were you afra
id a lot when yo
u we re in hiding?
 
A:  I was all the time tense, 
as y o ung as I was.   And m ay b
e for that I'm 
still a little 
nervous, but I don't show it. 
 Because now my sister-in-la
w is not so well, but why 
should I shout or be angry on
 her or wh at, I'm not that 
type.  I was 
not brought up 

like that.  But inside
 m ay b e I 'm nervous bec a us e I  went
 through a lot an
d it hurt  me 
a lot when I didn't get more, 
or how much did I 
get?  Four or fi
ve thousand dolla rs, 
that's all from the German.  While all thes
e f r iends that I know, ar e gett i ng mo nt hly  
good inc om es.  O n e of  my fr
iends went and she said that
 she's not, her mind is not 
good.  She's a year younger 
than I.  So they made her a,
 an exam.  She s a id st upi d  
things, she's very smart.  An
d now she gets eight or ni
ne hundred do
llars a month 
on Germany because she's inc
apable.  That's what they say.  She's much more 
capable than I will ever be,
 but she succeeded by ly ing 
and I'm not th
e type who will 
lie.  I'm not going to lie fo
r money.  I'm not going to 
lie for money.  But I went 
through, like you 
heard, a lot.  And p
eople who went much le
ss through, that I 
know, and they are alon
e, they say, you shoul
d get more than I, 
or you should get, 
but, y o u s h ould ge
t.  You understand?
 
Q:  Tell us, when yo
u applied f or t h at.
 
A;  I applied and I go
t, oh, three thousand or
 four t hous and dollar.
 
Q:  __________.
 
A:  In 1952, 53
, and then they 
gav e m e the three t h ousand
 dollars, I shouldn't hav e 
taken it, but nothing to do.  And then they
 refuse and they, now 
I know the reason. 

My uncle went through 
a lot, he lost a wife
 and t wo c hildr en, but I had a lawy er i n  
Belg ium, he wa s no good.  
T h at' s the m i st ake.  If y o u 
would go, it 
was then, you 
know, agencies took care of all that, and they would help you 
and do it.  I didn't go, I  
went  t o a lawy er who took  
a lot of money in advance, 
who didn't go
 anything. 
May b e he got s i x t housand, he gav e m e t hr e
e thousand or four 
thousand.  But all 
thes e friends of mine,  I don't k now if they
 got a sum, but they 
got, they get every 
month now.   And they really 
don't believe, I woul
dn't lie, if I would get, I would say, 
why, why the lying?
  Some people like to 
lie, I don't like 
to lie.  If I d
on't get, I don't 
get.  I'm not going to say 
I don't get when I 
get.  Or I get 
when I don't get.
 
Q:  Could you appeal it , then?
 
A:  I think it's too late
.  I think it's too late.
 
Q:  Have you ever
 been to Germany?
 
A:  I've never 
gone.  You?  No
, I would never go
.  No interest.
 
Q:  What about going to
 a plac e like Aus c h witz.
 
A:  I'll tell you the true, I don't, I went th
rough now a lot, too, 
last year with my 
husband being very sick and 
all the family wanted me to
 put him away _________ _  
and I didn't, I to
ok care.  So maybe another year 
or what, you know
, will be more 
relaxed, may b e I' ll do it.  
Be cause my cousin 
want ed v ery bad t o go, the one from  

Israel, t o the plac e wher e 
I was  bor n and wher e our  gr
andmother was livin g, but I 
wasn't ready to go with he
r because he wa s sick.  No w 
maybe, I'll take a rest a 
year, if  I'm  capable t o conc
entrate and relax, maybe I w
ould do it.  But not now for 
the moment.
 
Q:  When did yo
ur husband die?
 
A:  January, so 
it 's still fresh.
 
Q:  Oh, yes.
 
A:  It's still very fresh.
 
Q:  __________.
 
A:  Yeah.  Still fresh,
 so, I was all by myself
 and it's not ea
sy.  So, that's what it is.
 
Q:  How old was he?
 
A:  Was not young, was 78, 
but _________, very intelligent 
man, but very sick.  So, 
he j u st s uff er ed t h e last t wo m o nt hs, f e w m o nt
hs.  So nothing coul
d be done, so it 's 
a pity.
 
Q:  Did y ou, did y o u pur pos ely not have 
children or was that 
a dec is ion you m a de 
toget her ?
 
A:  No.  It didn't come
 out, I'll tell you wh
y I thin k.  Be cause when we married, his 
mot her bec am e old, she st ay ed with her dau
ghters, we used to 
go t h er e all the tim e  
and all the time and years w
ent by and you know, s om et im es y e ar s go s o f ast  that  
you don't know.  Yo u turn ar
ound and you're middle aged, 
you're old, no?
  It's like 
that.
 
Q:  So you've alwa ys 
been with people who 
are always very, ta
king care of their 
families?
 
A:  Yea h.
 
Q:  __________ your father.
 
A:  Yeah, and then al
so, then also I used
 to be very 
friendly with 
somebody, she 
had f o ur c h ildren and I  was t h
er e and I t o ok car e m os t  of
 t he time of t he c h ildren 
and now I don't know if they'l
l recognize me.  That
's it.  Some stay 
friends with you, 
but some, ignore
 you, let's put it this way.
 
Q:  What was it lik e when y ou go
t, to go back a litt
le bit now, to Israel
, this idea that 
you had to hide being Jewish 
and you could, for so lo
ng, and t h ey g ot, cr eat ed 
terr ible danger f or people y ou lov e d, 
to be in a country where you could be 
com p let ely open and proud of being J e
wish.  What was that like for you?
 

A:  When?  When I came to Israel?
 
Q:  When you first went to
 Israel and you 
c ould, y o u c ould be r eally r e laxed.
 
A:  Yeah, I enjoyed it
.   I enj oy e d it.  But  I had a hard
 t i me bec a us e us ed t o live in 
the suburbs and go, and go to
 Tel Aviv and stay from eigh
t in the morning in that 
heat t i l sev en at night.   No
t be able to r efr es h or wha
t.  And fr om one t o f our,  the  
stores would be closed, so I just walk ed ar
ound, I didn't have what
 to do.  So it was 
ver y hard,  you under s tand?  
So I couldn't enjoy
 life enough bec
ause I had a hard 
time.  And I wasn't so close 
t o my  fam ily ther e bec a us e 
I didn't know them so lon g  
as my ot her fam ily that  I grew
 up with them.  So it was 
very hard.  Bu
t I came over 
that, too.
 
Q:  Tell us a little 
bit about life in Ur u
guay, whic h is where yo
ur uncle lived.  Who  
was there and wh
at was __________.
 
A:  He had two brothers, he
 had t w o br ot her s and t hey h
ad families.  And then h e 
got marr ied, he had his  own 
family.  And when the chil
dren became bigger, he was 
afr a id t hey' l l m arr y, int erm arr i age,  s o he 
m ov ed ev ery t hing t o I s
rael.  They should 
get marr ied with Jewis h gir l s, that 's what 
they did.  Because,
 you know, so much 
intermarriage, I don't 
have to tell you, no
?  So, and he's
 very r e ligious, so,  ver y  
religious.  So.  Lived a Je
wish life and always very nice
.  T he women have it very  
easy, a m a id costs you thirt y 
or  for t y dollar s a year,  a m o
nt h, so y o u can aff or d t w o 
maids.  And life is easy, but it's still not like 
in Israel, it 's 
still, it's 
st ill diff er ent.   Lik e  
here, it 's very nice, but  her e wi
thout a car, wi
thout, it's very hard, 
I don't have to tell  
you.  W h er e do y ou liv e?
 
Q:  Downtown 
W as h ingt on D. C.
 
A:  So it's not easy.  
 
Q:  When were you ever able
 t o say to your self f i nally
, my br ot her and m y mo ther  
and f at h er ar en't com i ng bac k ?
 
A:  T hat  was a f e w good m o nt hs af ter the 
war.  A f e w good m o nt hs aft er t h e  war. 
When I saw the realit y that the people w
ho came, came alread
y, and other ones 
won't come.  An d they 
began to talk and to 
show and then we sa
w that you have to 
ac cept  the trut h.  And the 
reality.  It was not easy in
 the beginning because yo u 
us ed to s e e, to go, t hen t h
ey didn't go like now to Au
schwit z to look and that. 
People didn't go like now to
 go,  but we all the t im e as
k ed, ask e d, we hear d tha t  
somebody came back 
and we we nt and mayb
e he wa s seeing th
em and that, that 
must be the way my uncle found that man 
wh o saw my parents.  That he found out 
that t h at m an was  in Aus chw
it z and saved himself and ma
y b e it was t he s am e tim e,  
and he lear ned t h at it
 was the same time.  
 

Q:  What did these people lo
ok like t o you, I  mean t h ey
 were pr es um ably c o ming 
back  v ery t h in.
 
A:  Very t hin, very nervous,  
very depressed.  But, they be
gan to live and
 they, that's 
it.  But in the beginning 
they were very skinny an
d very down, mentally and 
physically, both.  That's it.
 
Q:  I know that at that
 time they had newsreels 
of the c am ps and s o me 
photographs.
 
A:  Yea h.
 
Q:  Do y o u rem ember ev er seeing that?
 
A:  No.  I never saw that
 __________.  They were all 
so like the mu
seum, they 
have a place in Brusse
ls now, I would like to
 go and see that, if
 God willed, if I had 
the occasion, they have a ve
ry, very big place,
 s o m uc h t a ller t han m e, and it ' s  
written all the Jews from An
twerp and Brussels who kille
d where, at 
Auschwitz or 
Bergen- B elsen or,  where t h ey  
were killed.  
What date exactly an
d what time, what, 
and I want ed ver y badly t o 
go.   Somebody t o ld m e who 
s a w it a nd  m y  
par ents  wer e 
in that list.  Somebody told  
me they didn't see th
e list.  So I wa nted 
to go by myself 
once.  I want to se
e, one day I'll go.
 
Q:  Do y o u rem ember when you f i
rst saw photograph
s of  Auschwit z?
 
A:  It wears very much on me, very, made 
me very depressed.  I st arted to take an 
anti-depressant and it didn't 
help me because I was depre
ssed mentally 
very much. 
And then I see it won't help y
ou,  being depr es sed.  T a lked
 to myself.  
But it didn't 
help, it didn't help the pills,
 not talking, it was depres
sing because some people can 
see m ov i es  and so on and r e ad
, they don't mind.  
But it 's , it 's a c h ar act er.  Bec aus e 
I say I would never over live 
it, and some people say I don'
t know how I ov
er lived it 
and t h ey c a me out.
 
Q:  When was it ?  When wa s it
 t hat you f ir st s a w pict ur es ?
 
A:  All the pictures I saw 
'47 and before, and '46, '47.
  So, that's what it was.
 
Q:  Did you ever, with your 
uncle, do any sort of servic e of sit shiv a?  I mean. ..
 
A:  No, I keep a date
 that the rabbi gave me, a rabbi 
in Israel gave me a date and I 
keep that day, give a, 
I give a donation to Sc hul(p
h) that day and we say 
kaddish(ph) and that's all.
 
Q:  So y o u did mar k a day ?
 
A:  Yes.
 

Q:  And if you went to that museum
, you m i ght f i nd out an act u al day.
 
A:  That's it, then I might 
find exactly the day, maybe or
 approximativ e.  And I would 
like to go there,  
but no chance fo
r t h e last few y e ars  be
c aus e of  my hus band' s  
illness, but one day I'll go.  It doesn't do me too good, in
 '65 I was in Belgium and I 
went through, went from 
the house where we lived to
 where the school was and 
that.  The s t reet didn't c
hange, only the stores and t
he people change.  An d it  did 
me very bad.  St ayed
 thr ee day s and I r un away.  T h
ree days or two days, it was 
too much.  And I think it was too much beca
use I was alone.  I wa s not with a friend 
or, I wouldn't do that by my
self any more.  I would only go
 with s o mebody or  that I  
car e f or or, just som
ebody, not to go by
 myself, I wouldn't do i
t.  Also you know, the 
nights to stay there 
in a hotel alone and re
m em ber  t he street s an
d that.  No, no.  I 
wouldn't go back by
 myself, never.  
 
Q:  You uncle's still alive, 
I mean, do you ever
 think about pressi
ng him for details?
 
A:  He  had a stroke three 
years ago and his mind is  good
 and that, I don't think he 
feels like talking about 
it.  I don't think so.
 
Q:  Do you think he'd ever 
do an oral hist ory int erv iew?
 
A:  Doubt it, I doubt it
.  He's saw my tape w
hen I showed it in Is
rael and it made him 
very, don't know, he di
dn't feel depress
ed really, feel dead beca
use in my tape I say  
my uncle went to Ur uguay 
and left me alone.  So it  
was not a good
 feeling for 
people who heard and it  was 
said in the room.  You unde
rstand?  And I couldn't, I 
couldn't change the tape, the tape
 was t h ere, the tr uth was t h er e.
 
Q:  Did you feel like that?
 
A:  W h at ?
 
Q:  That he left you alone?
 
A:  Yeah, I felt lost a litt
le because I was y
oung and all my friend
s had parents and I 
was no parents, nobody,
 like left alone.  So 
it hit me a little, 
you know.  Not much, 
but a litt le.
 
Q:  How long did you st ay alone?
 
A:  In Belgium, maybe eigh
t, nine, ten months.  It was t
oo long.  It ' s
 the way you 
feel.

 Tape3
 
Q:  Th is is  an in ter v ie w with A nn y K as
t, K- A- S- T.  Co nd u cte d by  Kat i e Da v i s o n  
A ug u st 5 in  S i lv er Spr i ng , Mar y la n d.  T h is is
 tape number three, 
side A.  I'm curiou s 
about how you think yo
ur experience hiding
 and y our loss es,  28
 people, how that 
aff ect ed y o ur appr oac h t o lif e?  May b e y
our philo sophy or your
 interactions with 
people?
 
A:  The f eeling, t o t e ll y o u t he tr ue, I had
 is that people are al
one, lik e m e now,  
should take care of themself, 
but I'm the person that I like
 to give and not wait to 
receiv e.  I like to give fr
om myself, to be go
od to people, to help people.  If it 's 
mentally or physically
 or materially, I like 
to give, I'm not dema
nding and I'm not the 
snob that s ay s I hav e or don't hav e.  I'm 
not the type to
 complain.  I 
had m any y ears 
that I didn't have and I ne
ver compla ined.  An
d people never knew 
if I have or not 
bec aus e I made an impr es s ion 
I  hav e a lot and I lik e d it be
c a us e I  don 't want pity.   I  

had enough pity during my first 
years, I don't want pity.  Th
at means even if I didn't 
hav e, whenev er s om e body cam e , I had c ak e
 and coffee 
and fruit and everything. 
The people came shouldn't know 
the way I feel.  I didn't want them to know.  An d 
I'm now like that, too. 
 Ev en people in  Israel, especially
, are very curiou s.  They ask 
you such pr iv at e quest i on
s that I can't accept.
 
Q:  About?
 
A:  I don't want to say mind your own bu
siness, that's rude, 
but people there ask 
you, what ' s your inc om e, wh
er e do you liv e, what do y o
u hav e?  I never would t h ink  
to ask somebody, even 
somebody I'm very clos e, it 's  
not my business.  And I never, 
and I  had no f at her,  no mot h er, nothing f or  
many years, I would 
never be jealous, 
and that's a character.
  Or env i ous ,  that 's  the sam e 
as jealousy, that
 you have that 
dr ess t hat  cost f i ve hundred 
dolla rs or three hund
red dollars and I ca
n't afford it, or 
what .  Bec aus e if  I 'll be j e
alous, it won't he
lp m e  get  t hat dr es s bec au s e I  can't  
afford it  if  I don't 
have that three, five hundred do
llars.  And it  
won't make me 
happier if I'll have that dres
s.  And if I didn't pay for 
the dress, it 
would make me 
worse because why should I 
go with a dress that I owe 
the money and I don't know 
from where I will take the 
money.  An d I never had an 
envy or jealous c h arac ter .  
They alway s as k m e, ar e y o u 
not jealous, this  co
usin has this, has 
this, has this. 
Sometimes I say, poor me,  I 
have no children and it 's a 
pity.  But t
hen I see the 
pr oblem s my fr iend ha
ve with their children,  I say I'
m very happy I do
n't have, what 
do I need t h is pr oblems for, 
I have enough of 
my own.  So, it 
won't help to b e  
jealous.
 
Q:  Were you ever envious, 
though, that other people h
ad their whole families and 
maybe they didn't know
 what they have?
 

A:  No, but I would be angr y 
and am, not envious exactly,
 of children my age when I 
was left alone, they don't appr
ecia te their parents.  That, 
yes.  Because I say, t hey 
don't know what they have
, they should 
apprecia te what they
 have, they have 
parents, they have grandpa
rents, they have aunts 
and uncle s and cousin s and 
they, such a big family, they 
don't know what th
ey have.  Some k
now, but not all. 
Not all the people know.  But 
it  won't help me.  But I ne
ver was, thank God, envious 
or jealous, never, never.
  I hope I will never be.
 
Q:  How do you explain that yo
u didn't  bec om e a r
eally, really bitter
 person who just 
saw darkness everywhere, yo
u know, that you 
lost so much and other people who 
lost what you lost, th
eir entire family...
 
A:  They're mo
re bitter.  
 
Q:  And jealous, envious.  But 
how, where did th
at come from?
 
A:  I think that has to do 
wi th upbringing and the characte
r of a person.  My mother 
us ed always to say when yo
u're grown up and 
y o u hav e  your  own 
house,  if peopl e  
com e, nev er put t hr e e c o ok ies on the t abl
e, put always f i ve.  M ay b e s om e body  
wants another cookie.  Never 
say, why don't I have that
 kitchen set, ne ver say. 
You'll have it.  
If you don't have it
, it won't help you.  She 
told me, I think, as much 
as I didn't see her long, no
t to be jealous and envious.
  Bec a us e she was n ' t.  I 
remember my aunt s had so,  
so much jewelry and so mu
ch she didn't 
have.  She 
nev er env ious. 
 
Q:  What do y o u r emember 
m ost about your mot her ?
 
A:  I remember she was a ve
ry good person, 
ver y good mot her .  She want ed m e t o  
lear n ballet,  what I wanted, 
dancing, ballet.  And I went 
f o r three y e ar s and t h en my  
gr andf at her  was s o  religious, he s ay s, " She
 cannot dance with her legs nude".  So 
my mother stopped my ballet. 
 But  she was a ver y
 good person, very
 good person. 
Never demanding, she ha
d a har d life, s h e didn't hav e th
e luxury we have to put the 
dishes and put the dishes ou
t.  You know?  Sh
e had a hard life
, she didn't have 
such a big apartm ent.  I don'
t k now if she had maids or 
not, I don't remember, but I 
know s h e didn't hav e a was h er or a dry er 
or s om ething like t h at, t h at  I'm sur e.  And 
also the climate was not like 
here, so, I don't k
now.  We were alwa
ys clean, I don't 
know when she washed, when 
she used to take 
us from school and bring us from  
sc hool and help us with t he les s on what 
she could and give 
me pr iv at e t eacher  
when I needed, when I 
was a little wo rse in some st
udies or somethings.  No, it 
was, no.  But to 
tell the true, I 
don't know.  She, I think 
she taught me 
not to be 
jealous.  And I don't 
want to be jealous, 
I'm  happy.  M y s i ster -in- law s a ys a lot of  
times, "When will you 
change?"  She d
oesn't wa nt me to be 
mean to her, to her I 
should be good, to othe
r people I should be mean.  She's 
also, she's very jealous if  

I'm nice with somebody.  Sh e 
wa nts to be the first.  It's 
a character.  It's like you 
want  ev er y t hing f or y ours e lf 
and I tell her, "You are ad
dict ed t o me".   She say,  
"Yes".  It 's a f e eling t h at 
a person has.  I'm no
t possessive, I don'
t want  a per s on t o  
be only mine, she can be ever
yone's person.  Bu
t why be possessive
?  Will it  help? 
No.  It won't help none to be 
possessive.  So what can I hel
p?  I don't 
want to be 
poss ess i ve and I ' ll nev er be.
 
Q:  Well, when yo
u thin k of your parents, your mo
ther and your fa
ther, what, is 
there one mem ory t h at is s ort 
of lik e, if y ou'r e falling as le
ep and y o u want to t h ink of  
them, is t here, what ' s t he mom e nt ?
 
A:  The moment is that, they
 st arted to make a more livi
ng and liv e  a 
little easier 
when they were take
n away.  And wh at I 
remem ber , as a sm all c h ild, they  had i t  
hard, v ery hard.  And then it  
st art ed to be a litt le bett er 
and ever yt hing br ok e.   An d 
they wer e not r ic h or well
 off  or  what , but t hey m a de 
a nic e liv i ng, t hey had  two 
childr en and that 's it.  But it
 st ar ted to be a eas i er li
fe than in the beginning, I 
rem ember.  She had t o go a
nd c om e and help m y f ather 
and help in the stor e a n d 
cook  and hav e all t h e pr oblem s.  You k now
, mending socks  and f i
xi ng t hat,  now a l l 
that we don't  do.  W e  
don't  hav e  that  life.  
 And she had a 
hard life, very hard life. 
And not convenient apartment.  
I remember when I was a ve
ry small child, we didn't 
ev en hav e a bat hr oom ,  we 
didn't.  Now each child n
eeds his own bathroom.  No, 
it 's true.  We didn't have 
at all.  We __________.  And 
then there was more comfort 
and t h en when you c a n enj oy, 
you c om e int o  40, t h en it 
was m i ddle age, y o u d on't ,  
they tak e it  away  fr om  y ou.  
 That's a pity.  They could 
have enjoyed a little, life, a 
few good years.  That's it.
 
Q:  Do y o u hav e night m ar es ev er ?
 
A:  Not especially.  But so
metimes I would see them and 
then get up in  the morning 
in a very, not go
od mood to see somebod
y.  Not in a 
good mood.  Bu
t it  doesn't  
help.
 
Q:  Bec a us e y o u s a w t hem the night bef or e?
 
A:  Yeah, saw them at night, 
not the night before.  I saw 
t h em, it was lik e hour s and 
it 's m a ybe 10 m inut es,  but 
it seems like hours, you s
ee, and then you close again 
your eyes, you see again.  
I don't know if yo
u had that.  You 
see somebody an d 
then you want to f orget what
 you saw, and y ou c los e y our
 eyes again, you see it 
again.  It must be strong in yo
ur mind that you see 
it again and again.  But, that's it. 
That's enough.
 
Q:  Okay.
 
A:  Thank you.
 

Q:  Thank you 
very much.
