Interview with Agnes Vogel 
July 9, 1997 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr 
collection. This is an interview with
 Mrs. Agnes Vogel, conducted by Dan 
Gediman on the ninth of July, 1997 in  In
dianapolis, Indiana. This is a follow-up 
interview to u -- to a USH
MM videotaped interview cond
ucted with Mrs. Vogel on 
July 14
th
, 1989. The United States Holocaus
t Memorial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making th
is interview possible. This is tape 
number one, side A. – Yes, very possibly,
 I -- I will -- I believe real strongly in 
preserving history. You might want to pu
t that down, cause the sound of the paper 
rattling. 

Answer: [inaudible] Okay. 

Q: All right. 
A: All right. 
Q: Okay, the first -- the first 
thing th at -- that I™m going to do is, they asked me to 
fill in a couple of gaps in the interview th
at you did with them
 on the video. There 
were a couple of things, n-
not so much during
 the war, but before and immediately 
after that th ey wanted me to
 ask about, to just fill in 
the gaps. And then we™ll focus 
on from after the war to the present. And if
 at any point you want to stop and take a

break, or you need, for whatev
er reason, to stop, or if there™s a question I ask that 
you™d rather not talk about, just say so. 
A: Okay . 

Q: Like to start by asking 
you about your family, abou
t -- let™s start with your 
parents. Who were they, what were 
they like as people, as parents? 
A: They were very nice people, they were
 very good parents. My father™s name 
was Dezsö Wieisz. 

Q: How do you spell that, his first name? 
A: D-e-z-s-o, with two dots on the O. That
™s a real Hungarian spelling, it™s a real 
Hungarian name. The family name was Wi
eisz and after the war, in 1948, they 
changed the family name to Varga, because 
of the situation in 
Hungary at the time. 
Q: And how can you s -- how do you spell that? 

A: Varga? V-a-r-g-a. 

Q: And so at what time would that na
me change have ha
ppened, roughly? 
A: I believe it happened after I left from home,
 and I left the end of ™46, so th e year 
it happened, probably  the beginning of ™48. 

Q: And so you say they  changed it becaus
e of the situation. 
Do you mean -- how 
do you mean? 
A: Well, I™ll go -- let me go back, let me 
tell y ou so mething about my mother. My 
mother™s maiden name was Ju
lia Schwartz. And my mother
 -- actually both of my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
4
parents were born the north west -- northeast
 part of Hu ngary. And my  mo ther was 
born in Ungvar, and my  father was born in
 a small to wn name
d Boatfaller. They 
were -- well, what™s the word I want to 
use? My father was quite a few years older 
than my mother and he waited until sh
e grew up for them to get married. 
Q: How much age difference? 
A: About eight years, probably. And -- an
d by that time my 
father lived in a 
different city in -- more in the middle of th
e hung -- eastern part 
of Hungary, that™s 
where I was born, called Debrecen. And he
 was a well established businessman at 
that time. And my mother was a very 
beau tiful woman and they  were a very 
handsome couple. I had three sist ers; there 
w as four children in the family, all girls. 

And I lived a nice life. 
Q: Tell me about your sister s, thei r names.  
A: My sisters, oh yeah, I™m the oldest, I™m 
child numb er one. I have a sister who is 
almo st five years younger and an other one
 who was born three years after her and 
one three years after. 
Q: And their names? 
A: Martha, Mariann -- actually Maria
nna and Gabriela is the youngest. 
Q: Just going to  move the microphone a little closer so we can pick  you up better. 
Not a whole lot, but just a little. A nd they all made it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
5
A: We all survived, yes. Well, our situ
ation was a little bit different than my 
husband. 
Q: I understand. 

A: So we all survived t
ogether, we were all to gether all through that year. 
Q: And what has happened to your sisters? 

A: They are fine, we all survived. One sister
 lives in New Yo
rk. One lives in 
Scotland and the youngest one
 stayed home -- home in Hu
ngary  to take care of our 
parents. See, the other two sisters, the tw
o middle girls left Hungary in 1956, after -
- during and after the revolution that they
 had in Hungary then. And one ended up 
in England and the other one 
made it to the United States. 
Q: So you™re the only one that left right away ? 
A: I left rig h t away. 
Q: Well, we™ll get to that, cause that™s much  of what we want to talk about. Were 

you poor, middle class, well-to-do? 

A: Well, it went from good to
 bad. When I was born my father was -- we weren™t 
rich, but well-to-do. And what I remember 
as a child growing up is hearing about 

things. When the crash of the stock 
market in the United States and the 
[indecipherable] got over to Europe by the 
mid 30™s, it had an effect on my father™s 
business. And then eventua
lly, in 1938, Hitle
r was in power and that was getting 
downhill. And by 1942 my fa
ther was in a labor camp.

Q: Your -- your parent™s pa
rents, your gran dparents, 
how would you describe th-
them in terms of their -- or thei
rs s-status fin ancially, socially? 
A: I don™t even know, I re
me mb er my  grandparents as old people. So mehow they 
were always old. My pare -- my moth
er™s parents and my  grandfather had a 
busin ess, he was a well-to-do man. They  lived in a beau tiful home. 
Q: He was a what? 

A: A well-to-do man. He -- they lived in 
a beautiful home, and I can still remember 
[indecipherable] built into 
the mountain there. And they had the business on the 
botto m of the -- you know, the street floor
 and the house was up on top, and it was 
a beautiful home with beautiful
 furniture and all that. We 
used to go there to visit 
and spen t -- I spent a lot of vacation time over there. My grandmother was a 
beautiful wo man, a very stately lady. An
d my  grandfather was a sweet old man. 
Q: And on the other side? 
A: On the other side they were -- well,
 it™s a strange stories because my  two 
grandparents -- my  two grandmothers were si
sters. My parents were first cousins. 
My father™s father, he was a different kind
 of a man, he was -- I don™t know how to  
describe him. I just rememb er him durin
g the hun -- you know, Jewish holiday s. 
He was a religious man, not overly, but he
 was you know, the both sides were very 
observant Jewish people. I reme mber my  
father™s father during the -- the Succoth 
holiday. And they always ha
d a sukkah built in the yard, 
and he would sit there and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006

take all his meals there and have his prayer
 book th ere. Yet, when he got angry, he 
could yell like -- and scream like a real
 Hungarian. He had a good temp er. 
Q: And you had said in the interview that 
I saw that your -- your fath er was able to 
trace your an cestors in Hung
ary back to the early -- 
A: Well, when the troubles -- the -- yes -- 

Q: -- 1700™s. 

A: -- when the troubles started in the 30™s
, you had to trace your ancestry back as 
far as you could go, because by 1938 - ™39, 
they were pick ing up people who were 
not so-called Hu ngarians. See, by that 
time we had a lot of people co ming from 
Slovakia, from Poland, from ot
her countries to Hungary, 
and they were mostly, I 
suppose at that time looking fo r those people.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Little did we know that not
hing is going to help. And 
yes, my father did trace 
our an cestry back  into Hungar
y to the 1700™s. On paper. 

Q: I want to jump around 
a little bit, cause again we™re filling in little gaps in the 
previous interview. You went to 
a Catholic school when it™s -- 

A: High school. 

Q: High school, 1939. I™m curious, you had 
gone to Jewish schools prior to that. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Why not a Jewish high school?
 How did you end up there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
8
A: There was no Jewish high school for girls, that™s why. 
Q: So it was -- 
A: And this was a specialized school, and 
unfortunately only the Catholic school 
system had it.  
Q: Specialized in what way? 
A: It™s mo re of an art oriented high school. 

Q: And you were gifted in art? 

A: Sort of. 
Q: I understand you still -- 
A: That was where we learned dress desi
gning, tailoring, sewing, drawing, and all 
associated with the arts. 
Q: Te-Tell me about friendships
 that you had in high school, both  with Jewish girls 
and non-Jewish girls, if in
 fact you did have friendshi
ps with non-Jewish girls.  
A: Actually, well we had quite a few Jewish
 girls going to that same school wh ere 
I went. I don™t mean too many, but you 
know, those were very small classes 
actually, so they had maybe I don™t know 
whether -- the first year I think maybe 
we had ab out 10 Jewish girls, and after th
at th ey sort of left. They™re maybe were 
two or three of them left altogether in 
the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish 
girls, other than being in  the school w
ith them no, I don™t think I was really 
friendly with any of them. That were stra
nge over there, see, 
because we grew up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
9
separated, you know, from early childhood,
 and we never mixed with non-Jewish 
people. We only wil -- saw Jewish kids. So  
by the time y ou were a teenager in your 
late teens in high school it™s -- we were fri
endly but we were ne
ver really so-called 
friends. 
Q: Was that by choice or by official
 design that you™d -- you stayed amongst 
yourselves? 
A: I don™t think it was a [indecipherable
] really, it just th
e way it worked out. 
Q: Would you -- how would 
you -- I™m thinking in term
s of many American cities 
where blacks live on one side of town  
and wh ites live on another side of town, 
where -- whereas there might not at this ti
me  be a legal reason why they can™t live 
together, they often don™t, and I™m wonder
ing was it a similar situation or was it -- 
A: No, no, no. There was one area where mo
st -- were more dominated by Jewish 
people, mo stly by the real Orthodox and th
e Hassidic type of Jews, but other than 
that, no. There was no area where you had to live. 

Q: That was my  question. 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no. 
Q: Okay. Cause I know in so
me cities in Europe there 
had been the remnants of 
ghettoes from previous eras. 
A: Shtetl, yes -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
10
A: -- I know, and I™ve been arguing 
that. I never lived in a shtetl, no. 
Q: That™s what I was trying to establish. 
A: At least not in my
 time in Hungary, no. 
Q: Okay . So  you did not have friends wi
th  non-Jewish kids that you were clo -- 
A: Not close friends, no. Bu t by the time I 
got to that high school, it was already 
troubled times. Hitler was already on the ho
rizons and as sweet as the nuns were -- 
there were a couple of them who were wond
erful, and I really think of them highly 
forever, because they were nice human beings
. But then there were
 others who just 
as soon would have hand me over to
 the first Nazi who came about. 
Q: Tell me about them. What 
-- wh at memo ries do you have of these nuns that you 
got that feeling about? 

A: Well, I remember especially the one 
nun -- you know, it -- I mean, you go to a 
Catholic school and there™s -- during th
e time you go and you have to say some 

kind of a prayer, at least in those days 
they did, and I remember at one time this 
particular nun came up to me and said, 
you better go down on 
your knee and pray 
because what™s happening out in the world.
 And in those days a lot of Jewish 
people did convert to Catholicism and -- 
hoping it will save th
em, butnothing did. 
Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you 
lived in Hungary centuries 
back -- you also had to prove that you were
 not Jewish centuries
 back, so it didn™t 
help. I remember when we were in the 
wagon already, there was a young woman 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
11
docto r with us, she never knew she was Je
wish. Her parents converted during the 
first World War or right after, so she wa
s born, you know, as Christian. And yet 
she was considered a Jew. 
Q: This -- so this nun that
 told you you better get on yo
ur knees, wa -- I™m unclear, 
was she saying that with malice or with concern? 

A: No, I think it was malice and no conc
ern, because if it would have been 
concern, I probably  wouldn™
t remember it th e way I do. 
Q: What about the other kids? You intimat
ed in your previous interview that you 
had experienced some -- 
some anti-Semitic -- 
A: Well, while we were in the class it 
was fine, there was no problem. Well, the 
thing I mentioned then, I believe it was th
at when we were being marched from the 
ghetto to  the brick factory, th
ere was one of the girls that 
I went to school with and 
I used to walk with her home from school, 
and sh e thought of nothing picking up a 
stone and throw it at me. See, people -- we 
were walking in  the middle of the road 
and the people were standing on both si
des on the sidewalk and watching us 
leaving town. 

Q: But back when y
ou were going to school, what did you experience in terms of 
any -- or did you -- any problems with
 any of the other Gentile girls? 
A: I don™t remember any, really. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
12
Q: Okay . Let™s talk about the co nditions 
of your deportation 
from your hometown. 
W -- How did that come about? You -- you 
rushed th rough it a little bit in your 
previous interview. I mean
, how did you find out that
 it was going to happen  and 
what -- could you tell us, sort of take us
 through from when yo
u found out that it 
was going to happen til when
 you were actually -- 
A: [indecipherable] okay, let me g o  back
 to the Jewish school, 1938, when our 
principal came into the class -- well, I gue
ss he went to every class, to tell us 
what™s happening in the world and what 
we may accep -- expect. And he had -- a 
big guy, and he had tears in
 his eye -- his eyes as he 
was talking to us. That was 
1938, and I think s -- well, at first -- after 
that it was getting hard er to hold a job if 

you were a Jew. I remember in 1939 it was wh
en my father lost his job, he was a -- 
a district manager for a -- a 
farm machinery comp any, and he lost his job because 
he was a Jew. And then 1942 -- well, in 19
39, when Hitler gave 
back the northern 
part of Hu ngary that belonged to  Czechos
lovakia, and that time to Hungary. And 
my father was in a uniform,
 the Hungarian army™s uniform
. He fought in the first 
World War, so he was called up ag ain to
 pay the country ba
ck. And by 1941 he 
was called into labor camp, ™41 - ™42 th en th
ey let him out for awhile and then they 
-- took him back again. In 1944, March 19
th
, it was on a Sunday afternoon when  
the Germans -- German army flew over Hung
ary. I can still see it, it was a dreary, 
nasty day. No sunshine at all, and I gue
ss it was foreboding of what was coming. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
13
And we saw the plan e fly over our city and af
ter that it went one,
 two, three. They 
came in on the 19
th
. By April fifth we had to put on
 the Jewish star. May sixth we 
were put into the ghetto. I was watching 
them building the six foot high wall all 
around the area. In my town, in Debrecen,
 they had to make two different ghettos 
because there was a main road
 going to the railroad stati
on which they couldn™t cut 
off. So there was a smaller side where we 
lived and there was a larger side on the 
other side. So our house happe
ned to be in the smaller 
area, so that™s where we 
were. And to the day the wall was finish ed we did not believe it, that it will 

happen. It was impossible, 
we lived there forever. I wa
s born there, I grew up 
there. People were hoping that the mayor 
of the city, little did 
they know that he 
had no say so, won™t let it ha
ppen. But at any rate, May 6, 1944, we were locked  
into the ghetto. And in June -- 
Q: I hate -- I hate to say it,
 we are going to  need to do something about the phone. 
A: Well, the only thing you can do is just take it off. 

Q: Would you trust me  -- I™ll be ha
ppy to put it back the way it was. 
A: Just take it off. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And just let -- [tape break] 
Q: All right. One small thing,
 and that is, if you could make an effort not to put 
your hands in front of the microphone. I mean -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
14
A: I™ll try. 
Q: -- only -- there were -- there were -- th
ere was one time when you were putting 
your hands like so. 
A: I was coughing, I didn™t want to cough into  the microphone. 
Q: No, you were just telling a 
story and you had your hands -- 
A: Oh. 
Q: So if you could just -- don™t be too 
self conscious, but just be aware -- 
A: Oh. 
Q: -- that if you put your hand in  front of it -- 
A: Okay . 

Q: -- it creates a problem. Okay, so you we
re locked in
to the ghetto. My question 
is, when did you find out that you were 
going to be deported, and how did that 

come about? How -- 

A: Well when we found out -- 

Q: And how did you fi
nd out, and were there others 
deported before you and was it 
something you were expecting, or -- 

A: We didn™t know what to expect. To 
this day we don™t know how we didn™t 
know, but we did not know 
what to expect. The way we
 found out we were gonna 
go was a Sunday  mo rning that
 the people came in with
 the loudspeaker, walked 
through the stra -- the streets, it was Su
nday  mo rning and th 
-- they said start 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
15
packing because by the afternoon you all have
 to be at the other side in the big 
ghetto. And then we knew. I 
mean ho-how long can you stay stupid, right? I me an, 
you had to know something was happening. 
My father wasn™t home and there we 
were, my mother and the four of us and 
a -- a little cousin of mine, my mother™s 
nephew, her sister™s son who came with us to
 live. And that™s it. We started to pack 
whatever we could an d by noon people were
 co ming in to the house to make sure 
that we™re not taking anything valu able w
ith us. So much so 
that there were two 
guys and one wo man who came to the hou
se, and the wo man to
ok my mother into 
the bedroom to check her inside, literally, he
r inside, to make sure that she is not 
hiding anything in her body that™s valuab
le. And the afternoon we were over at the 

other side. And that was that. That was 
Sunday afternoon and then, for a strange 
reason, luckily, they 
brought my father ba
ck with a bunch of other people in his 
group. So at that point in time we were a
ll together. My family and a -- a brother of 
my mother -- father and her -- his si
ster. And another cousin of mine. 
Q: But my question is, what was it like 
when they took you aw ay from your 
hometown? 

A: From my hometown -- 

Q: Yes -- 
A: -- or from the ghetto? 
Q: From the ghetto. When -- when you left -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
16
A: Well, we were in our home. After that we were homeless. 
Q: Wh-When you were -- 
A: We were homeless. That™s what we were. 

Q: -- when you were taken fr-fro
m the ghetto and you were -- 
A: And then  we stayed on the other side
. Not long, maybe a few days, I™m not -- I 
don™t remember exactly what it was, four
 or five days maybe. And they were -- 
that™s when we were walking to the brick 
factory. And we stayed there for about a 

week or so, and that was a horror. That 
was absolu te horror. We had to get into  
groups every day and walk down to the railr
oad tracks and wait in case we were 
going to  be taken someplace. We didn™tknow wh ere, but we were going to  be 

taken someplace. And then they started to
 group people together, and we ended up 
in a group, they had many children in the 
families. And I think I was the fifth or 
sixth there and finally they 
put us into the wagons and 
we started off. We went to 
the border of Hu ngary and Slovakia a
nd I rememb er there was one of the 
Hungarian gendars who was on the -- standi
ng on the back of the train. I guess, 
now in looking back I think the wagons, th
e car we were in, the cattle car we were 
in must have been the last 
one. Either that or each one
 of them had one of those 
guys standing th ere, traveling with us. A
nd that guy, I remember w h en it -- they 
start the train and he said to us, that™s as
 far as I can go with 
you. God be with you. 
So he must have b
een somebody with a little heart,
 or maybe he knew where we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
17
were supposed to be going. And that was that and I remember at th at point I had 
the feeling that this is it, you know, all of
 a sudden  it just h
it that I™ll probably 
never get out of the cattle car alive. A
nd so me miracle happened, for some reason 
we stayed there overnight and the train di
dn™t move and th -- early in the morning 
it started to roll again and we were looki
ng through th e cracks which way we™re 
going and we were going back into  Hu ngar
y, we were in the middle of Hungary. 
Next we knew we start to now s -- go to 
Budapest. And soon after that we kept 
going and we crossed the border to Au stria 
and -- and there we were. We ended up 
in Austria. 
Q: Let™s step back a little bit. What was th-the transport like in the car? What was 

the -- I know it wasn™t very pleasant, but 
can you describe what the -- what it was 
like? 

A: Well, if you can imagine -- you know 
what a cattle car looks like? Okay. Can 
you imagine that filled  with about a hundr
ed people or more? 
Families, children, 
old people. Small children, some who were 
lame and not able to move readily, you 
know, that sort of thing.  

Q: Did people stand, sit, lie down? 

A: Whatever you were able to
 do, that™s what you did. 
Q: And wh-what did you do for wa
ter, or relieving yourself, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
18
A: Well, they -- they -- we had a bucket 
of water and we had a bucket for other 
things, and I remember when we start aroun
d the outsk irt of Budapest, they gave us 
some fresh water there, and that was it. We
 w ere very lucky because we didn™t stay 
in the wagon very  long. It was just one of 
those freak things that you don™t have an 
answer for. 
Q: In your -- in your interview that I saw 
and read the transcript of, you say that 
you were supposed to have
 gone to Au schwitz. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: How did you learn that, that you were 
supposed to have -- that that train -- 
A: Well, everybody was supposed to go 
to Auschwitz. Now we 
found out here in 
the United States already, just a few years 
ago, there is a -- a historian, a Hungarian 
man, he teaches now at New Yo rk Univ
ersity. He wrote a book called, ﬁThe 
Genocide of the Hungarian Jews.ﬂ You ma
y have heard of it. And he found out 
that at that point, where we were suppose
d to be crossing into Po land -- now we 
were told at the time th ey couldn™t ta
ke us through because they bombed the 
viaduct and the [indecipherable] the train 
couldn't get through. Bu t what he fo und 
out was that there was a group of people 
who made a deal with the Germans to be 
taken out of Hungary  from Budapest, or wherever, from all over the country. And 

somebody made a mistake who was directi
ng the -- the cattle ca
rs, and by the time 
they realized that they 
took those people on the 
way to  Auschwitz and called

Eichmann, the -- the trainload was too 
far gone to bring them back. And 
supposed ly Eichmann told him, whoever was 
in charge, to find 
another group with 
the same amount of people in it and take th
em to Austria. And su pposed ly that was 
the group we were in. 
Q: What did you know ahead of time? 
What had filtered through to your 
community about wh at was going on and -- 
I mean, did you -- did you thro ugh the 
grapevine hear -- learn things? Di
d you listen to the shortwave? 
A: We listened -- we listened to the Eng
lish radio, we listened to the American 
radio. To the very last day we were ho
ping and praying that Mr. Roosevelt will 
come and save us. Well, Mr. Roosevelt di
dn™t come to save 
us. As wonderful a 
man as he was, but that he didn™t do. We
 knew there was trouble, because by 1940 
- ™41, many, many, ma ny Slovakian Jewish 
people were in Hungary. They all were 
running away from Slovakia, only
 to be caught in Hungary. 
Q: Had you -- I guess my  question is, 
by the time you were on that train, 
supposed ly for Auschwitz, wh
at did you know of -- about
 the camp s or -- or how 
people were being killed? 
Did you know any of that? 
A: No, we didn™t know anything. 
Q: Okay .

Q: This is a continuation of the Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Agnes Vogel. This is tape 
number one, side B. What was life like -- 
I™m jumping ahead now
 with the questions, these fo
llow-up questions, in -- is it 
Strasoff?  
A: Strasoff. 
Q: Strasoff, before the war ended. 
What was the conditions like there? 
A: Right before the war ended? That was 
terrible. See, luckily
 we didn™t spend too 
mu ch time over there, but a short time, a
bout a month and a half while we were 
there, that was bad. There was no food pr
actically. Sanitary conditions were awful. 
It was cold. That was bad. 

Q: Was there any sort of organizational structure amongst the -- 
A: We had no time for that. We had no tim
e for that. See this -- this camp wasn™t 
like Auschwitz. We saw no k
illing over there. There was 
one day when the put us 
into the wagons and we were to be take
n to Bergen-B elsen. And that was the only 
cruelty that I saw, when one of those 
guard s, a woman, a Ukrainian woman guard 
hit my father on the head w
ith a bat of some sort, a piece of wood, because he 
couldn™t run fast enough fo r her. But other 
than that there was no other what you 
would call, you know, cruelty
 like you hear from people who were in Au schwitz. 

Q: Where were your sisters dur
ing this time? Were they -- 
A: We were all together. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
21
Q: Okay . 
A: We left our house togeth er
 and we came back together. 
Q: How did you decide to return home af
ter the war? Was it an automatic decision, 
did you -- was there any debate? 

A: It was decided for us, 
we had no other way to go. 
When we were -- we were 
liberated April 10
th
 when the Russians came in an
d a few [indecipherable] to the 
west they were still fighti
ng, so there was no way to
 go except back where we 
came from.  

Q: Were you at all apprehensive ab out going back there? 
A: Oh, of course we were. Then we were 
leaving -- we were told to leave. There 
was no choice, we were told to leave be
cause they had to bur
n down the camp, it 
was in such an awful condition th
at that had to be burned.  

Q: So at that time there were no di
splaced person camp s or any place -- 
A: Not for us, no, no. See, there was s
till fighting, the war wasn™t over yet, and 
then we were liberated. 
Q: So you went back  to your hometown . 
What was it like -- you™ve de -- you™ve 
described about -- well, first let me ask 
you how lo ng was that
 trip from the -- 
A: That trip? Over a week. We walked
 on foot. We some
where along the line 
managed to get a wagon with a horse. So
 some of the people who couldn't  do 
walking well enough -- see, I had a cousin
 of mine who had polio since he was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
22
small child, he was two years old and he 
had polio  and he never walk ed. And so 
some of those people were sitting on top 
of the wagon an d the rest of us walked . 
We walked this way and the Ru
ssian soldiers came that way. 
Q: For -- what -- what did you eat for a week? 
A: What did we eat? Well, we stopped at
 different farmhouses and wh atever we 
could find, we took. 
Q: So they were vacant? 

A: I™m sorry? 
Q: The-These farmhouses were vacant? 
A: Most of them, yeah
. They left so fast they even 
left the hot food on th e table. 
Q: And why did they leave? 
A: Be -- they were afraid of the Russians, of course. 
Q: When  you -- wh en you got back to -- 
is it Debrecen, how 
do you pronounce -- 
A: Debrecen. 

Q: Debrecen. I -- I understand from the inte
rview you gave before that you were 
received very poorly by the 
people who were left ther
e, that they were not -- 
A: Well, I wouldn™t say all the people, but 
when we got off the 
train in the station 
and we were walking the main street to
wards our home, and they  looked at us -- 
but then , these were young people, not older, young people, they greeted us, you 

know, how come -- what are you doing back  
here? You were supposed to be dead . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
23
Q: You said not everybody was like that. 
Can you tell me more ab out the varieties 
of different reactions that 
you might have gotten from -- 
A: You know, it was such a long time ago 
and what I can remember is there was 
really no time to look at reactions because 
we had noth ing on ou
r body except the 
clothes we left a year ago -- a year before
 that. And th -- you 
know, our first -- we 
walked in to the house and there was nothing 
th ere. It was totally empty, everything 
was taken out. So our first pr
iority was to look around an
d see if we can start a new 
life. So there was even no time to look 
and see what people thought and how they  
reacted. 
Q: How -- just so I get an idea before 
I ask you the next several questions, how 
long were you th ere before you made
 the decision to leave the country? 
A: Well, we got back there in 1945, May,
 and I think by end of the year I decided 
that I had to leave. 

Q: So a little over six months you were there? 

A: Yes. 
Q: What -- 
A: I couldn™t convince my  family to le
ave in the same time, because, see my  
mother have -- had at that time tw o sister
s over here and lots of relatives. And I 
mu st say they were very  nice, they sn -- you know, send th e papers right away  and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
24
everything that they needed to
 do, they did, to get us ov
er here as a family. But it 
took longer than I had patience for, and I wanted to leave. 
Q: Let™s step back a little bit before that, 
I -- I™d like to talk to
 you about what life 
was like there in your hometown before you
 decided to  leave. You say you were 
there for about six months or so. Ho
w did you -- you -- you came back home, 
there™s noth -- not a st -- there™s n o
 furniture, there™s no nothing, you -- 
A: Well, we came back home and you were
 looking fo r people you knew befo re, to 
see if anybody came back, my uncle, my a
unt™s husband wasn™t with us, he was in 
a labor camp someplace. Luckily he survived
 and he came back. Yet her son, who 
was somewhere in Germany, never made it 
back home. So we used to go ev ery day 
to the center point of the Jewish life over 
there in that time, that was hastily put 
together, to look at names who they foun
d and you know, who was alive. And that 
was that.  

Q: But you had no money,
 you had no belongings. 
A: We had no money. 
Q: How did you get by, wh
at did you eat? How did -- 
A: [indecipherable] well, there was 
a place called the Joint Distribution 
Committee, if you ev er heard of it. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
25
A: And they gave us some clothes, they 
gave us a little money to get started with. 
And the rest we just, I don™t know, see, I 
-- I had my parents. I had my father. He 
took care of all that. 
Q: Di-Did he find work? 
A: He mu st have, some kind of a work , be
cause eventu ally he did do something to 
provide fo r us. 
Q: But you don™t rememb er what? 

A: I don™t remember. 
Q: Did you see when you went
 back, former schoolmates 
f -- I™m ta -- I™m thinking 
of Gentile folks that you would have know
n before you were put into the ghetto 
and before you we
re taken away ? 
A: No, not any of my  classm
ates, no. See, it was a total chaos when we went back, 
it was still soon after rea
lly, so-called liberation. Ev
erything was in chaos. The 
school I -- the Catholic school I went to 
was disbanded, there were no mo re nuns 
around. It was -- I don™t know, 
everybody was everywhere.  
Q: Of the Jewish population in your hometo
wn, were you all on that one train that 
was turned around? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, th ey -- they took 
12,000 [indecipherab le] the population of 
12,000 Jewish people in that city. That 
city wa -- had a population of the w -- at 

that time about 120,000 people, and 10 
percent were the Jewish population. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
26
Q: And who -- how many made it back alive? 
A: Not a whole lot. 
Q: Roughly, do you know -- have any idea? 

A: See, the transport we were in wa s they weren 't only from Hungary -- from 
Debrecen, they brought people 
over there from outlying areas in different stories. 
So we had people with us
 from Szolnok, we had peopl
e with us from Szeged, from 
Miskolc, from all over the place. That was,
 I guess, the biggest city around and so 
they brought people over there. 

Q: But do you have any idea 
from reading or speaking w
ith people s-since the war 
has ended, any notion of 
how many people surviv ed 
from your hometown, of the 
Jewish population, roughly? 

A: I have a book, I could -- I could look it up for you. 
Q: Don™t worry about it. 

A: But I™m really not sure. Not -- not too many, I know that. 

Q: So what was it like for y
ou to  come back to your hometown  that had treated you 
badly, if a -- if I™m ma king sense, to 
come back to the same people who had been 
persecuting you befo rehand and to come b
ack and there being such a small number 
of Jews that were left and I guess 
-- maybe I™m asking a -- an inappropriate 
question, that it sounds like your concerns 
were mu ch more concrete, day to day, 
what you were going to eat, how were yo
u going to get by. But I guess I™m ju st 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
27
wondering what it was like to come back to
 your hometown  in 
this chaos and such 
a different place than you grew up. Wa
s it -- had many other people left? 
A: Everybody. 
Q: You mean, escaping from the -- the Russians, or -- 
A: You mean the -- 
Q: I mean the -- 

A: -- people who came back?  

Q: No, what I™m really  referring to is 
Gentiles from the town
. Had they -- was it 
pretty much intact? 

A: Oh, that part of it was -- th-the
y all stayed. No, they didn™t leave. 

Q: Okay, cause you were talking about 
the people in the countryside that had 
abandoned their fa
rms with the -- 
A: That was in Austria. 

Q: Okay. So you decided to leave, let™s go to  that part of it. How is it that you -- t-

tell me about your decision to leave and wh y you decided to leave when  the rest of 
your family was staying. 
A: Well, for one thing, since I was the olde
st in the family -- I saw no future there, 
for one thing. And I always, since I was a lit
tle girl, I alw ays want
ed to come to the 
United States of America. 

Q: Why? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
28
A: I™m not sure exactly why, but I -- at 
the -- you know, when
 I was little child, I 
don™t know why, because I heard my  parent
s talk about it so mu
ch and we have -- 
we had so  many relatives already here. An
d that sounded like an exciting place to 
live. So after the war I had a choice of 
either going to  Israel, where I also had 
relatives, b ecause my father™s whole fam
ily was in Israel by that time, including 
my grandparents. And -- or 
come to the United States. 
And since my  mo ther had 
two sisters who were here and they  ask 
me, they says, please go to the Un ited 
States because I want to go there someday 
too and be with -- be with my  sisters. 
And they were very nice people, they se
nd me the appropriate papers and here I 
am.  

Q: I want to -- I want to ask you in mo re detail about that, cause not many other 
people, it wasn™t so easy, in terms o
f, you know, immigration quotas and other 
problems. How long -- when did you -- wh
e -- from when you decided to come, til 
you actually came, how long 
did it take to -- to -- 
A: About two years. Close to two years. 

Q: And what did you do in  the interim?  
Did you spend all that time there in 
Debrecen? 
A: No, no, I stayed in Hung
ary til the very end of 1946, 
yeah, I worked a little bit. 
Q: What did you do? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
29
A: What did I do? It™s a 
good question. See, by th at time they had a very good 
Zionist organization built up already and 
a lot of young people coming and they 
had all sorts of offices there, and I worked
 in one of those places there. And fo r -- 
end of ™46, in December, or -- yeah, and then
 I left. And then I went to France, I st 
-- I stayed in Paris for abou
t eight weeks until I could get 
in a ship and then I came. 
Q: Let™s step back a little bit, so you sp
ent all told about a 
year and a half in 
Hungary before you went to Paris and then  ev entu ally to the U.S.? 
A: Right. 
Q: I guess I™m trying to get a feel for a 
daily life for you then. What -- what did 
you do? Wh at --di-did you 
have friends, did you simp
ly do th ings with your 
family? 
A: I had lots of friends. 
Q: I™m -- I™m trying to get a f -- 

A: There was lot of young people 
who came back from labor camps, from 
Auschwitz without anybody, without their families. So
 what -- those were busy 
times. If you could do away with  all the other 
events that led up to th at, that could 
have been a very nice time. But you know, th
at sort of thing lingering in the back 
of your mind, I tried to make the most of
 it. And ev erybody was trying to  look fo r a 
way to get out.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
30
Q: When  you say busy times, 
you tried to ma ke the mo st of
 it, I™m trying to get a 
feel for what it was like for life to be
gin to get back to something resemb ling 
normal. What -- wh-wha -- socially, wh
at did you do? Wh at -- when you -- 
A: Well, like I said, [indeci pherab le] there were a lot of young people coming back  
and I had a lot of friends, and most of my  friends, by the way, ended up in -- in 
Israel. [indecipherable] I was friends with. 
And they were just, I guess, for lack of 
a better word, trying to bide our time until we
 could find a way to get out, is what it 
was. 
Q: So ev erybody was look
ing to leave somewhere? 
A: Everybody was looking to, th
ere was no -- no future there.  
Q: Were there -- were those pretty much
 the choices, or were -- me-meaning the 
U.S. or Israel. Were people looking to go 
to Australia or other parts of the world? 
A: Some people did, it depends, you know
, wh ere you had connections, or wh ere 
your interests were. Or whether -- where yo
ur luck was, really, to get you wh erever 
you wanted to go. 

Q: Did you have -- let me ask you about fri
ends of yours, or extended relatives. I 
think you™ve pretty much to ld me about your extended re
latives and what happened 
to them, but did you have friends that died? 
A: Oh yeah, quite a few didn™t come back
. Yes, and some who even died befo re 
because they were ta
ken to labor camp. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
31
Q: Close friends? 
A: Some. 
Q: So you got to Paris, tr
ain? From Hungary to Paris, did you take a train? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And where did you stay when you were
 there? You said eight weeks to wait for 
your papers to come through and to get a ship. 
A: Well, see, what happened is my father took me to Budapest, put me on the train 

and then  before the train left, he went ar
ound and see if he could find somebody 
who was going the same way as I was. A
nd sure enough, he di
d find a young lady, 
somewhat older than myself 
at that time, who not only
 was coming to Paris, but 
also was going to th e United States of Amer
ica. Not only to the States, but going to  
the same city that I was going to and to
 the same neighborhood wh ere I was going 
to. 

Q: Detroit? 

A: Detroit, Michigan, yes. To the same 
area where my family lived, and so we 
became sort of fast friends and he -- she t
ook care of me. I stayed with her in the 
same hotel while we were in Paris and he 
-- she left a few weeks before I did. But 
she had a nephew over there who was a conc
ert violinist and he™s been living in 
Paris for some time by then. So she put him 
in charge of me, so 
to speak. So I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
32
well taken care of until I got on the ship an d my family took me 
off in the city of 
New York. 
Q: What was it like -- where -- on the ship
 coming over, were there other Jews that 
were coming -- immigrating? 
A: There were a lot of Jewish people co
ming, yes. Some were going to Cuba, some 
to the United States and some Mexico and they were going all over the place. 
Q: Do you remember at all how you felt -- 
I me -- that was th-that trip, about how 
long did it take? 
A: About five days, I believe.  
Q: Were you fearful, anxious, excited? 
How were you -- do you rememb er at all 
what -- what it was like? I me an, you di
 -- here, you™ve left your en tire family 
behind, this whole horrible experience -- 
A: But see, I left my family 
behind in the hope that with
in a year™s time I would be 
with them also. So I didn™t 
just walk out on them. But 
I guess it wasn™t mean to be 
because not even a year -- before the year was up after I left, I -- they closed the 
borders and nobody ever le
ft from there until 1956.  
Q: Who closed the borders? Who closed -- 
A: Who closed the bo
rder? The Russians.  
Q: So that™s why they di
dn™t come to join you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
33
A: That™s right. That™s why they couldn™
t leav e, w h en  ev ery  
-- everything stopped. 
And by 1956, my parents beca
me ill, my fath er had a couple of heart attacks. My 
mo ther came down with th-the Parkinson di
sease and there was no way for them to 
leave. And this is why my  youngest sist
er left home -- I mean, stayed home in 
1956, because the other two were already 
married, and she was still single, being 
the youngest. She was just a young girl. Wh
en I came out here, I re member I u sed 
to send her money to  take dance classes a
nd I used to send -- I sent her money to 
buy a bicycle when I started to work
. And she was the victim of it all. 
Q: And she stayed there. 

A: She stayed there and she™s still there. 

Q: In -- in -- 
A: That™s 1997, right? 
Q: In -- in the same to wn? 

A: In the same town, yes. My pa
rents are gone and she™s still there. 
Q: Do you have any other extend
ed family that 
still live there? 
A: No. 

Q: Cousins, or -- 

A: No, I had two -- I had three cousins 
who came back from Auschwitz. See, my 
mo ther™s whole family ended up in Au schw
itz, I had four aunts -- five. One, two -- 
four -- four aunts and an uncle who all 
perished in Au schwitz. And some younger 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
34
cousins who were just small children, a
nd th e three who survived  were, you know, 
young adults, and they made it. 
Q: So these were all siblings of your mother? 

A: Yeah, from my mo
ther™s side, yes. 
Q: Do you remember at all 
how she came to learn that 
and what that was like for 
her to learn wa -- that all -- was that -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- all of her siblings? 
A: -- to see -- my  cousins, all three of 
them were home long before we got home 
because Auschwitz was liberated in January
 and we didn™t ge
t home til April. And 
they came to see us and that™s ho
w we found out wh at happened.  
Q: Was that all of her siblings? 
A: Mm-hm, except the two sisters [indeci
pherable] she had he
re in the United 
States. 

Q: Do you remember what th
at was like, her -- I mean, 
how she dealt with learning 
that? 

A: That was hard. That was hard, but ther
e was no other thing to do but deal with 
it. You know, there is an in teresting thing that I rememb
er, when they were taking 
the people, the first transport from Hunga
ry to Auschwitz a
nd there was -- my 
mo ther™s family were among th e group, and I reme mb er my  mo ther walk up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
35
[indecipherable] and said, I had a terri
ble dream. She had a dream seeing the 
family walking down the road
 and there were two rows 
of candles on each side of 
them, lit, as they were wa
lking down the road. Now by
 the time we got home it 
was more or less a fact. 
Q: How did you fi -- di -- I mean, how di
d you feel about this? Did you -- I mean, 
did your family grieve, 
did -- did you grieve, did 
you -- was there time for 
grieving? 
A: There was really no time to grieve 
like you do nowadays wh
en somebody dies. 
You had to keep alive. You were alive, 
you had to go on. Bu
t I think you never 
really stop grieving. That™s also just part of our life.  

Q: You came to New York  on the ship. Do
 you remember what it was like the first 
time you saw New York , the fi
rst time you saw America? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What was that like? 

A: It was overwhelming. I™ve 
never seen such big buildin
gs in my life. Oops. It 
was exciting, it was unbelievable. I think 
I must have felt like Alice in Wonderland 
when I got off the boat. 

Q: Were you emotional, was it -- 
A: I don™t know, I™m a very emotional person
 so I guess I -- that was just exciting.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
36
Q: This ma y be a kind of a cliché, but 
I™ve spoken to other pe
ople who have made 
that trip who were very affected by the St
atue of Liberty and y
ou know, all of that 
and I was wondering if that had any impact
 at all or was it just [indecipherable] 
A: I guess, the fact, it probably did. I re
member -- oops -- oh, I have to go back  a 
little bit. 
Q: It™s okay. 

A: On the way to -- from Paris to the sh
ip, you know you take a little boat that 
carries you out there to the sea. And ther
e was a couple, an  older couple sitting 
across from me and there I was sitting a
ll by myself with a little book of English 
and Hungarian translation and I tried to 
read and brush up of whatev er English I 
knew. And they were trying to find ou
t who I was and wh at does a young girl do 
on a boat like this all by herself and wh er
e I came from and where I™m going and 
they tried to talk to me 
and up until that point I thou
ght I could sp eak English. 

Well, when I heard them talk, forget it. 
I didn™t understand almo st [indecipherab le] 

what they™re saying. So I found out eventua
lly that they we
re from Brooklyn 
visiting Europe and coming back from Euro
pe and they were very sweet people, 
they took me under their arm. When  they  
found out I was from Hungary, th ey went 
all over the boat searching for a person, an
other person from Hungary I can be with 
through the trip so I won™t be lost. 
As it happened there were quite a few 
Hungarians there, Jews and non-Jews. And 
the person they found for me to be with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
37
and eat, you know, the meals with, was a non-Jewish person, a guy from 
Cleveland, of all places, who took his wife
 to Hungary because she was sick and 
took her there for some kind of treatment
 and he was coming back to  the States. 
And when we got to New York , this 
lady from Brooklyn grabbed my  arm and 
pulled me out to the, you know, end of th
e wherever there was 
in the boat. They 
says, hey look, look, that™s the Statue of 
Liberty. So that was my introduction to 

the Statue of Liberty. 

Q: Let me just move that [indecipherable
]. Did you -- let™s see, how can I phrase 
this question? Given wh at yo
u had just been through in  Europe, was it difficult for 
you to be around non-Jewish people, pe
riod? Were you afraid of them, were you 
concerned? I guess what I™m trying to ask you is -- 

A: Not really. 
Q: No? 

A: No. Do you mind if I [indecipherable] 

Q: No, not at -- not at all, not at all. 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Agnes Vogel. This is tape
 numb er two, side A. I was just asking 
you, cause I™ve heard from -- from other surv
ivors who felt very leery to be around 
Gentiles when they -- when 
the war was over because they
 had been turned on by 
all the Gentiles in their life prior to that 
and -- and so they had a hard time trusting 
that it wouldn™t happen  again. And so
 that™s why I asked the question. 
A: Well, I don™t know, maybe I™m differe
nt, but I never really had too many 
chances to be with 
Gentiles, because when we got 
to Paris, I had some friends 
already there from home whom I met, they
 were all Jewish people, young -- young 

people. So I had no reason to
 get friendly or get close to
 any of the Gentiles. And 
when I got to the United St
ates my family didn™t -- weren™t friends with any 
Gentiles. So again, I didn™t ha
ve a chance to meet any. 
Q: Your family met y ou when  
the boat came in in New York. 
A: Right. 
Q: Now refresh my memory, did you -- you 
had -- did you have relatives there in 
New York or is ever
ybody in Detroit? 
A: No, th ey came from Detroit. I did ha
ve a relative from New 
York, it™s a cousin 
of my  mo ther whom my  aunt and uncle to
ok me to visit, and they lived on Park 
Avenue someplace in a huge 
apartment with a beautiful, 
big, brown dog. And they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
39
were very lovely  people. Th
ey were very impressed the way I looked, coming from 
where I came from, and that was that. 
I never saw them again after that. 
Q: Was it at all emotional, your family
 that you™d never met, I™m assuming -- 
A: No, not too -- 
Q: -- coming to meet you? 
A: Emotionally what way? 

Q: Well, for some other people, coming ov
er here and meeting up with relatives 
was a big deal for them, for both sides. Fo
r the -- for the -- the American relatives, 
do you know, to be -- 

A: [indecipherable] with my -- my aunt
 and my uncle, yes it was a little bit 
emotional, but with the cousins, thes
e were already second, third generation 
Americans. They [indecipherabl
e] They lived their life and 
th at was a lot of story. 
Q: You said second or third generation 
Americans, who -- who would have c -- 
who of your ancestors
 would have come over that long before? 
A: Well my -- oh well, before the tur -- way 
before the turn of the cen -- middle of 
the last cen tury -- 
Q: Okay . 

A: -- they were coming over he
re, the uncles of my  parents. 
Q: Okay. So in addition to your -- 

A: A-Aunts and uncles and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
40
Q: So you had quite a few re
latives here, not just your 
mother™s sisters. Okay. How 
d -- did you spend mu ch  time in New York , or
 -- or did you go directly with them 
o n  to  M i ch ig an ? 

A: No, not a whole lot, beca
use they had to co me back
. See, I arrived here in 
March and at that time I think the tax 
time was in March in those days, if I 
remember right. Also, my -- one of my cous
ins, my  aunt™s daughter who pick ed me 
up had her birthday in March,
 so they had to  come home, you know, for those 
reasons. But we drove -- they drove into
 New York , so we drove back  and we 
stopped on the way in  Scra
nton, Pennsylvania to visit another cousin of my  
parents, lovely, lovely people. And then 
we came home, or we came to Detroit. 
Q: Now they  obviously sp
oke Hungarian, your --  
A: I™m sorry? 

Q: They obviously spoke Hu ngarian -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- your -- your aunts. 
A: Oh yes, they still do. 
Q: And the -- the men that they married
, were they Americans, were they 
Hungarians as well, th e -- were they married? 
A: Oh yes, they all had families. 
Q: And where had -- where did these men come from? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
41
A: Where did what? 
Q: Your uncles, where did they come from? 
A: They were also Hungarians. 

Q: Okay , cause I was wond
ering about you -- the language problem. You had poor 
English, you™ve already told 
us, wh en you went over -- 
when you came here, and I 
was wondering what it was like for you to start to -- 

A: It™s not so much that I had poor Englis
h, because I -- I did 
take English lessons 
and I wrote -- as far as writing, I wrote ve
ry nice letters. My 
family in Detroit 
couldn™t wait for me to get here. But also, 
I am a rather -- well, what™s the word 
that I want to use? Bashful? And I don™t lik
e to be laughed at. And so I tried when I 
got here, but then a few of -- little teas
ing and I clammed up. And I spoke no 
English until I met my  husband-to-be.  

Q: I don™t think that™s an unusual thing. My
 mother has told me 
similar things, that 
until she learned English well, she was uncomfo
rtable speaking it, just for that very 

reason. 
A: But then you can™t learn it 
well unless you start talking. 
Q: Right. It™s a problem.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: So, when you got to
 Detroit -- you were how old by th is time? 
A: I was 20. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
42
Q: 20. What -- what did you do? What -- 
A: Well, six weeks after I was here I 
went to work , they
 found me a  job. 
Q: Doing? 
A: At a tailor shop. Men™s -- 
it w as a men™s shop, actually. 
Q: And you were d-doing alterations, or -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And you lived with
 them, with your -- were there 
cousins your age, or similar, 
or -- 
A: Well, close to my age.  
Q: Younger, older? 

A: [indecipherable] not exac
tly my age, but you know 
[indecipherab le] here and 
there, and mo st of them were younger. 

Q: Did you -- tell me about your first e
xperiences with -- dealing with Americans 
other than your -- your family, who were 
immigrants as well, like -- like the people 
at the tailor shop were -- how did you -- 
A: They were actually very nice people an
d there was a very nice lady, a nice 
Polish lady who worked ther
e also. And she was as sweet as can be. I guess I™m -- 
I™m really lucky because I fel -- I -- I me
t very few nasty people on the road. 
Eventually I -- I did find some
 of the younger American girls, the so-called -- well, 
I don™t want to say the American princess, 
but you know, that -- t
hose type of girls. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
43
They  had no patience for me. I couldn™t speak their language, so that was -- you 
know, but that was fine, I really didn™t 
need them because there were a lot of 
people like myself in Detroit at the time 
and we had a nice group of people we 
were friends with. 

Q: When  you say like yourse
lf, other immigrants, or -- 
A: Yeah. Yeah. 
Q: Did you develop friendships
 with native born people? 
A: Mm, not right away. Well, may b e one couple.  
Q: And how would you get to
 know people with these 
-- did you -- did you go to 
synagogue here? Were they people in -- in
 the -- that liv ed in  the neighborhood, 
were th -- with work? 

A: Well, over there in those days -- well,
 through the families. See, most of the 
Hungarian families, you know, they  all 
had somebody who surviv ed and co ming 
over. So that™s how we met. 
And then there was the Jewish
 center in Detroit, that 
was the center point of going to  school ov
er there and meeting people. They just 
[indecipherable] 
Q: You said going to scho
ol, did you pursue school? 
A: Mm-hm, yeah. 
Q: Well, tell me about that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
44
A: Well not -- I went -- at the beginning I we
nt to the Jewish Center to take some 
English classes and then I met my husba
nd, then that was -- you know, life became 
a whole different thing. 
Q: How did you -- how did you meet and 
when did you meet? How long were you 
here before you met him?  

A: Well, I came in March and I met him, I 
think, a few months later at the Jewish 
Center. He came in to say hello to the t
eacher and then  he looked around the class 
and he -- when the class was over 
he was outside of the door.  
Q: And? 

A: And that™s it. 

Q: He was outside the door, and? 
A: And was -- you know, we -- he walked me
 home after that and he -- we started 
to see each other and that was that. 
Q: How long did you court? 

A: Well, we met in -- let™s see, maybe 
in April, May, and we got married in 
February next year, following year. 

Q: In Detroit? 

A: Mm. 
Q: Now he had also an aunt 
or uncle here, is that right? 
A: He had one aunt. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
45
Q: That™s what I thought. 
A: That™s the only relative that he has. 
Q: That -- that made it. That™s what I 
thought. Did you, during the time that you 
were courting, talk much about your
 respective experiences in the war? 
A: Some. Probably not enough. 

Q: What do you mean by th at? 

A: Well, what I mean is, we were mostly
 trying to  look ahead, not back, if it makes 
any sense. 
Q: Mm, I understand that, but you said pr
obably not enough, the implication being 
that there should 
have been mo re. 
A: That ch -- maybe, but I don™t think at th
at time he could have taken any more of 
it. There had to be a time to [indeciphera
ble]. We needed time to sort of settle 
down and live. Look at life instead  of th
at. Eventually it came true an d now we™re 
at the point where we almost ta
lk about nothing else but.  
Q: We™ll get to that. That seems to be a ve
ry consistent experience of people, that 
there was a -- a period of time, so metimes 
a very long period of time where it was 
not comfortable to talk about it am
ongst themselves, or with others. 
A: It™s not so much that it wasn™t ca -- well,
 first of all -- let 
me just go back a little 
bit. I know when  I came out here I ha
d the grandiose noti
on, you know, that 
everybody wants to hear my  story so I™ ll be going around and talking about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
46
Nobody want to hear the story, come on.
 We were kidding ourselves. Even my 
own family, who lost so many memb ers, clos
e fami ly, you try to talk to them, they 
would ch ange the subject. They couldn™t. 
They couldn™t bear listening to  it.  
Q: But you tried? 
A: Of course.  
Q: So it sounds like -- 

A: So th en you just gave 
up. I me an, there was no sense of talking because nobody 
-- first  of al l, nobody could really unders
tand what we went th
rough. We could tell 
them from morning til night 
and from night til morning a
nd still talk and nobody 
can understand it. It™s -- it™s -- those thi
ngs that happened to us, it™s -- it™s like a 
horro r story, it™s -- in your wild est imagin
ation you couldn™t conc
eive it and picture 
it, no less understand it. 

Q: So, because they couldn™t
 conceptualize it, there was 
little point in discussing 
it? 

A: Exactly. 
Q: Plus in th e case of your -- your aunts 
and uncles, they had lost family, so there 
was, in addition to the lack of empathy fo
r what you™d been through, there was also 
that -- the -- the pain and th e grief of ha
ving lost the fami ly. What about -- did you 
know other -- other than your husband,
 before you met your
 husband, did you 
know other survivors that were there in Detroit? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
47
A: Yeah, sure.  
Q: Did you ever talk to them? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What was that like? 
A: What could it be like? You just listen. Mo
st of the people I met in  Detroit, they 
all came from Auschwitz. So
 you know, all I could say 
is my  God, how lucky I 
was.  
Q: This is, you know, I mean
 no disrespect to ask this, 
but did you ever feel guilty 
that you were as lucky as you were? 

A: No, not really. I don™t think I had 
or have any reason to feel guilty. 
Q: No, but -- 
A: I just -- what they sa
y, the luck of the draw. 
Q: There™s no reason you sh ould feel guilty
, I just -- there are 
some people who do 
feel that. 
A: No, I heard that me ntioned many times
 before [indecipherable] but no, I -- I 
mean, it never even came to my mind that I need to feel guilty. 

Q: Was it -- do you remember th e first time 
that you spoke to another surviv or who 
had been in Auschwitz or any of the ot
her death camps, and actually heard from 
their lips what happened? 
[phone ringing] Let™s wait ti
l it™s finished ringing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
48
A: Yeah, well, the first ones I heard from,
 what happened in [indecipherable] my  
cousins who came back, you know, we me
t them after we got back home to 
Debrecen and th ey came to see u s. So by
 that time, you know, by the time I came 
here I -- I knew about it. 
Q: Well, let™s -- 
A: It wasn™t all together, you know, new to me. 

Q: But -- well then, let me ask you, when yo
ur cousins came back to Debrecen and 
you first heard about it then, 
do you remember what it was 
like to -- to hear about 
that? 

A: That was such a long time ago 
that really -- I really can™t -- 
Q: It™s okay. 
A: -- I really can™t remember what I felt. I™m
 sure that it must ha
ve been awfu l, but 
-- 
Q: Okay. I just thought I would ask. Let™s 
talk about you and yo
ur husband. So  you 
met. Do you rememb er at all the firs
t time that you tw o talked about your 
experiences, do you rememb er?  

A: Well -- 

Q: What was that like? 
A: I couldn't believe -- well, first of a
ll he™s got something ag ainst the Hu ngarians 
to begin with, but you have 
to know him, too. See, he
 was in Auschwitz for two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
49
and a half years by the time the Hungari
an Jews arrived, and he couldn™t 
understand how come that we
 didn™t know anything ab
out it, what was going on. 
And they  didn™t run the other way, instead 
they ended up in Au schwitz. So that -- 
and I think in some ways -- in some ways 
I think he held it against me that I w as 
free that much longer, while 
he was already in camp.  
Q: You know, when  I first read yours and y
our husband™s stories in the transcripts 
that they sent me, I was stru
ck by the disparity of your 
experiences, what he -- he 
went thro ugh and what you went through 
A: Oh yeah, exactly. 
Q: And wondered wh ether over the years that
™s been at all problematic for the two 
of you to  have such different experien
ces, and w -- and whether it™s g -- that™s 
caused -- 
A: No, not really. 

Q: -- any problems or -- 

A: No [indecipherable] I mean
, eventually he understand that it was not my fault, 
and I had nothing to  do with it. No . 

Q: I don™t know if you can answer this, 
but because it was such a short period of 

time after you came to this country that y
ou met your husband, maybe this is not a 
-- a question you can even answer, but I gu
ess what I™m wondering is whether it™s -

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
50
- whether you could imagine being married to someone who hadn™t had this 
experience? 
A: I don™t know. I probably could have
. I don™t think -- can imagine why I 
couldn™t. 
Q: I was just wondering whether -- I mean, 
certainly I know people in my  own life 
whose -- who are my age whose parents -- 
where one of them was a survivor and 
one of them was not. So obviously it happen
ed, but that™s -- I™m 
ju st wondering in 
your life whether that was something -- it™
s -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s an academic 
question cause you did meet
 and you did marry, and -- 
A: And that was that. 

Q: I™m sorry? 
A: And that -- and that -- that was it.
 Well, I d on™t know. I wonder sometime, 
actually, what would have been like to 
live with somebody who didn™t experien ce 
what he did.  

Q: What has it been like fo
r you because his -- h-he 
went through so much. Not 
that you didn™t, but wh at has it been lik
e as his wife to -- to deal with his 
experiences secondhand over the pa
st 50-odd years, 50 years or so. 

A: Well, at times it hasn™t been all that 
easy, butwe managed,
 we got through it. 
Q: When  you say not easy, in what way not easy? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
51
A: Well, because of his, I guess becaus
e of his personality and because -- oops -- 
what all those years, you know, did to 
him and the way he [indecipherable] ma y 
have changed his pers
onality and what he co
uld have been like. 
Q: Did you have any -- when 
did you have your first child? 
A: 11 months after we got married.  

Q: Did you ever have any co nversations
, was there ever any question in  your 
minds that you would have children? 

A: No, not really, that was just
 the way it™s supposed to  be. 
Q: Well, the reason I ask is I™ve heard tw
o different things from people. Nu mber 
one, pondering the now cliché
 question of do I want to 
bring children into this 
world, knowing wh at I know ab
out wh at is possible. And th
e flip side of that which 
is I want to have as many children as I ca
n to repopulate the world. So that™s why I 
asked. 

A: Well, see, in those days they didn™t have the birth control pills. I missed out on 

that. 
Q: And you have how many children? 
A: Four. 

Q: And where did they come -- how lo
ng -- I mean, how fa
r apart are they? 
A: Well, let™s see. 1949 through 1961. 

Q: And how f -- what are their names, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
52
A: Well, there™s four, almost five years 
between the first two, and then the third 
one came 16 months later and the four
th one came seven years after that.  
Q: And what are their names? 

A: Their names? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Howard, Caryn with a C, C-a-r-y-n a
nd in the time I picked
 th-that name my 
friend really thought I was crazy. 

Q: Why? 
A: Because that was a different spelling of
 -- of Caryn. And to
day it™s all over, but 
for years I haven™t seen it. But anyway, an
d the next one is Linda, and th e younger 
-- the youngest is Elaine. 

Q: She™s the one born in ™61? 
A: ™61. 

Q: When do you recall first talking to
 any of your children about what had 
happened  to  you and your husband? 
A: Well, it wasn™t too lo ng after, as 
soon as my son was old enough to notice 
things, really. You know, my  husband has 
a number on his arm, which you can see 
in the dark, big enough. So, you
 know, children ask questions.  
Q: And how do you tell a 
small child about this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
53
A: Well, luckily my husba
nd has a very good sense of humor, and so he™s got a 
way of making a joke out of mo st things. So
 wh at do you tell a four
 or five year old 
child? Right? You can™t go and tell him, caus
e first of all they wouldn™t understand 
and then , why. 
Q: So what did he tell him? Or do 
you rememb er at all the gist of it? 
A: Well, I remember h e told him he was in
 jail, and he was a prisoner and th at was 
that. 
Q: When I was a small boy, the -- the ma
n who cut my  hair, the barber at the 
barbershop had been in Ausc
hwitz and I didn™t -- of cour
se I was -- I was the four 
or five year old child, and I said -- I as
ked him, what™s that on your arm? And he 
said, well that™s my phone -- phone numbe
r, so I don™t forget my phone number. 
A: Yeah, that™s what my husband says, t
oo. Not only it™s his 
phone number, it™s his 
house numb er.  
Q: What about when  your ch ildren we
re older? Older t -- old enough to 
understand?  
A: Well, we told them, and they knew. Th
ey knew that we were a different family 
from all the other friends they had, b ecause you know, we were -- there was no 
grandparents, there was no immediate aunt
s and uncles. No c
ousins anywhere. But 
you know, we never made a big 
deal of it, so they got th
ro ugh it until they were old 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
54
enough to  understand and th ey began to le
arn in school and knew wh at it was all 
about. 
Q: Do you reme mb er the first time a
ny of your children came to you asking 
questions in any depth and wanting you to
 talk about it? Maybe after reading -- 
seeing something in  school or
 hearing something, or -- 
A: I think we just sort of, as we went al
ong, you know, as they grew  older we told 
them a little more. So it was a gradual process. 

Q: Was it something that you an d your husband at all talk
ed about between 
yourselves, about you know, was their a
ny conscious thought about how to tell 
them or what to tell th em or what not 
to tell them, or was it just sort of -- 
A: Not really, no. I mean, like I said, we ju
st, as they grew older and that, we just 
went along with whatever 
they were coming up with. 

Q: How is it that you came to leav e Detroit? 

A: Well, because of my husband™s job.  

Q: I -- I know I™ll be talking to  him tomo
rrow, but just basically what does your 
husband do, or what did he do? 

A: At the time he was work ing for a clot
hing comp any, who had several stores, 
you know, and so th at™s why 
we ended up traveling. And 
then he hooked up with  a 
big -- the discount outfit, one of the firs
t discount stores in the country and we 
traveled some more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
55
Q: Where did you go, briefly. 
How did you -- from -- from -- 
A: From -- from [indecipherable] we were -- 
Q: -- from Detroit to here. 

A: -- and I went to Grand 
Rapids first -- Mich igan, Gr
an d Rapids, Michigan. From 
there we went to Binghamton, New York. 
And then we went -- from there we went 
back to Detroit again. That
 was with the discount corporation, and that™s how we 
ended up in Indianapolis and he became a 
district manager and 
they  moved us to 
Indian a [indecipherable]. Th
at was three years ago. 
Q: I™m sorry? 

A: 30 years ago, almost. 

Q: So you -- were your children born in 
different cities along the way, or were -- 
A: Actually, all four of th
em were born in Michigan. 
Q: You were there that long? Oh yeah
, so 30 years ago, that -- so you -- 

A: Well, we went back . 

Q: Right, I see.  
A: [indecipherable] when the 
first three were born in Detr
oit now, the two of them 
in Highland Park and the third one was born 
in the city of Detr
oit. And then when 
the last one came about, we went -- we
 were back in Michigan again. 

Q: Hold on one second. So you came 
here, it™s 30 years you said, ™67. 
A: To Indian -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
56
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- Indiana? Indianapolis? Actually, we -- 
let me see, w e came
 to Michigan City 
in 1964, and we were there five ye
ars, and then from there we came to 
Indianapolis. So we™ve been in 
Indiana for over
 30 years.  
Q: When -- okay, I™m gonna -- I want to 
come back to these questions, there™s 
some questions, the things that I mailed to
 you th at they specifically want me to 
ask, and then I have questions that
 I™ve come up with on my own -- 
A: Well, okay. 
Q: -- just in the past day or so, having 
given this some tho
ught. Hold on for a 
second. We talked about that. One of th
e questions -- I™m going now with things 
that they wanted me to ask you, wh
at -- after having had such a horrible 
experience, what -- what strengt
h did you draw on to -- to 
go on, to -- to make a fa 
-- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: -- absolutely. 
A: Three minutes, four minutes. 

Q: Take your time. Take as mu ch time 
as you want. This is a continuation of a 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Agnes Vogel. This is 
tape number two, side B. -- asked -- that
 you™ll be asked to do. I was asking you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
57
before the -- the tape -- the last tap e e
nded about what -- what -- what has helped 
you to -- to cope, to -- with
 the memories, with the -- th
e grief, with the -- has your 
faith been helpful or -- or 
was that something th at you struggled  with when  the war 
was over?  
A: You mean religion? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: No, I had no problem with that. The st
rength -- oh well, once we had a family 
and we had children, there were no questi
on, I mean you had to go forward, th at 
was that. The children were our strength. 
Q: You said religion was not a problem. What did you mean? 

A: I -- I am Jewish. I was born one and I 
always will be. I™m not overly religious. I 
keep a Jewish home, I ra
ise my kids in the tradition, or I try to.  
Q: Let me rephrase the question. I guess so
me people would say that there™s a -- 
can be a difference between th
e -- the rituals of being an observant Jew in terms of 
ke-keeping kosher and high holiday s and 
g-going to temple, and -- and having 
some sort of relationship with -- with a God, meaning -- how can I pose the 

question? I guess it™s a -- the classic ques
tion th at many people have coped with 
over the past 50 years since th-the Holo caust, is -- you know -- 
A: Where is God? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
58
Q: And how could God have le
t this happen and all of that. And I™m wondering if 
you ever had, at any po
int in your life, pondered any of th at, or -- 
A: Sometime. Sometime, yes. A nd I thi
nk I -- I ask where™s God after the war 
when my parents were so si
ck, when my mother suffered 
so much, I think that was 
the time when I asked where is God, why 
did she deserve wh at she got? After what 
we went thro ugh.  

Q: Did you come to any conclusions? 

A: No. There is really no conclu sion. Yo
u don™t know why. Things just happen. 
When we started out our life together, I ke
pt kosher. I had Friday  nights traditional. 
Even my own family in Detr
oit didn™t believe it, after 
what I came from, that I 
would do something like that. Howe -- my
 husband co uldn™t care less. My son was 
Bar Mitzvah because I dragged him to hi
s classes, literally 
by his ear. And my 
husband kept telling me, don™t bother, he does
n™t have to do it. I said yes, he have 
to do it, because that™s what 
he is and he have to do it. And so he did. And after we 
left Detroit, I don™t know, I -- there were
 places we lived where it wasn™t easy to 
keep kosher. There were no kosher but
cher. So I bought 
the meat in the 
supermarket and I koshered it. Took it to
 a ma n who koshered. And gradually I did 
away with that, too. Not to the point that 
I ever -- to this day I don™t eat pork, and I 
don™t bring it in the house. I don™t even 
eat it out. Now today I have the four kids. 
My son has nothing to do with religion. My  
daughter lives here in town, he marry -

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
59
- she married a Catholic guy who turned  Jewi
sh and today he is mo re religious than 
the rabbi, to the point wher
e they don™t even answer 
the telephone from Friday 
night until Sunday even
ing when the Shabbas is over. So there.  
Q: And wh ich daughter is that? 

A: I™m sorry? 
Q: Which daughter is that? 

A: That™s the first one, my oldest. 

Q: And -- 
A: That is the oldest of the girls. 
Q: And then  the other two dau
ghters, what happened with -- 

A: Now, the one in New York is not married
, and the youngest on
e is also married, 
a Swiss guy who is not Jewish, so -- but 
they did go to  a Seder in Sw itzerland and 
he enjoyed it very mu ch. And she does the 
traditional things for th e holid ays, you 
know, she bakes the hamantashen and the 
-- whatever. It comes [in d ecipherable] 

Q: And your single daughter in New Yo rk
, does she -- is she observant at all? 
A: Not too. She comes home for the holid
ays mo st of the time, depending how it 
falls, you know. 

Q: I™ll obviously  be talking to your husba
nd in mo re depth about this tomo rrow, 
but was he -- you say he -- he wasn™t very
 su-sup-supportive, or ma ybe that™s not 
the right word, of your -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
60
A: No, that™s the right word. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: [indecipherable] he wanted 
to do nothing 
with religion. 
Q: Did he humor you? Did -- 
A: Oh, he went along with it because
 I wanted to do it, but you know. 
Q: Did he join in? Did he do his part
 in the rituals, and -- or did he -- 
A: Mm, sort of. Now he™s beginning to get into it. 
Q: Hm. What about -- I™m still staying with 
the thread of things that have made 
your life meaningful since the war, and it™
s -- this, the largest portion of your life, 

the -- the past 50 years. I g -- I gather you™
ve retained interest in the arts. I know 
when you were a girl you were -- I -- I 
gather you™re still doing it, painting 
ceramics. 

A: I™m doing it again now. Th-The -- th
ese kind of pain tings
 pulled me through 
between having babies. 

Q: Tell me about this -- your th -- yo
ur -- this passion, hobby, avocation? 
A: Ah, no, it -- well, I guess you can call 
it both. Actually, this goes way back 
when I was a teenager back home. See, 
in those days in Europe, this was a 
beautiful profession. 
Q: Why don™t you -- why don™t 
-- because this is an audio interview, let™s describe 
what this is. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
61
A: This is what they call a porcelain pain
ting. Porcelain art is what it is. And in 
those days before the second World War, 
this was a beautiful profession. And my  
family had a very good friend wh o did th
at, and then when 
-- when I became a 
teenager, I took lessons, 
not from the family friend, but from another young 
woman, who did some beautiful, beautiful 
work. And it was just in the early 40™s, 
so we really didn™t have mu ch time, but 
we were hoping, before we knew what was 
going to  happen to us, that someday we gon
na come to the Un ited States and bring 
our beautiful painted porcelain. We
ll, it didn™t happen. Somebody else 
[indecipherable] otherwise. So
 then when I came to this 
country -- see, if I would 
have ended up -- if my  family would have
 lived in Syracuse, 
New York, you know, 
I could have been painting chin a for 50 year
s. But since they lived
 in Detroit, there 
was no need for that. 

Q: I don™t understand. Why would 
Syracuse have been different? 
A: Because, I believe in Syracuse, New York
, isn™t that the home of the Syracuse 
China Comp any, whatever? 
Anyway, so -- a-and then I find out, after I was 
married already, that they™re giving -- they
 had a very good sy
stem in the schools 
in those days in Europe, as far as adu
lt classes were going, and I found out there 
was one of these, and I went. And I took 
some classe s over there, and in between 
kids, you know, when I coul
dn™t go out of the house all day long an d he would 
come home and watch the kids and I would 
go to class. And I did it. And then I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
62
worked at it when we 
lived in Flint and I did it when
 we lived in 
Michigan City. 
And then  wh en we moved to Indianapolis I couldn™t find anybody to  wo rk with 
and so I hadn™t done 
anything for years until about 
three years ago, when I met 
somebody by accident, and so
 I™m at it again. 
Q: What other -- are there other arts that 
you are attracted to, or 
get joy out of or -- 
either doing or observing, or -- 

A: Well, there™s a lot of things I can do, 
you wouldn™t really call it arts, but yeah, I 
tried stained window -- stained glass. But then the wo man I was work ing with 
moved aw ay from town  and so 
that was the end of that.  
Q: What other things do you en
joy doing -- that bring you joy? 
A: I enjoy reading. 

Q: Fiction, non-fiction? 
A: Both. History. Think it™s an interesting subject. 

Q: Have you had other classe
s other than your porcelain? 
A: Mm-mm. 
Q: Mm-mm. What about any more passive
 things, concerts, I don™t know, opera, 
ballet, movies? 
A: Oh yeah, I -- I worked 
for a ballet school for 22 years, I just retired -- 
Q: Doing what? 

A: -- end of May. I was running the office.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
63
Q: So you did that afte
r your kids were grown,
 or did you start to -- 
A: Well actually, I got into it because of 
my  youngest daughter, believe it or not. 
Q: Tell me about that. 
A: She -- well, she was a very cute, dainty
 little girl when she was small and I took 
her to ballet classes. I started her actua
lly in Michigan City
 and then -- for two 
reasons I did that with her, because she was 
also a very shy child and I figured that 
will be good and you know, bring her out 
a little. And the older kids took wer -- 

when we were in Michigan 
City were in the children™s 
theater group, and they  did 
great over there. And -- but she was too young
 for that yet, the 
little one. And then 
when  we moved to In dianapolis I -- one 
summer there was nothing
 to do for her. 
And so I called up and I took her to the Bu
tler University ballet classes and she got 
hooked. She wanted to be a ballerina. An
d that™s how I got in there and now she 
left and I stayed. 

Q: Has she continued to dance? 

A: She did for awhile, but then  she ha
d problem with her back and then she 
[indecipherable] so she stopped.  
Q: Politics. Once you came to this country , 
did you get involved  at all with de -- 
politics, domestically? 
A: Not really. Just on the side. 
Q: On the side meaning? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
64
A: I™m in -- actively involved in  politic
s? No. Am I going out campaigning, and 
that sort of things? No. Well, first of all, 
I didn™t have time for 
it, it takes time and I 
had four kids to take care of, so you kn
ow, there was nobody else but me for them, 
so that was out of the question. 
Q: When did you become a citizen? 
A: Five years to the day 
I arrived here, I think. 
Q: What was that like for you? 

A: That was wonderful. It was 
an -- an unspeakable feeling. 
Q: How so? 

A: Well, just imagine yourself being th
rown out of one country and taken in to 
another and you become a citizen. On the 
other hand, there is always that little, 
small voice, you know, in the 
back of your head, what if it will happen here too? 
So this is why I think when 
I -- I raise my kids, all I want
ed them to do is whatever 

they do, to be inde
pendent enough so wh
erever life will take
 them, they will be 
able to land on their two feet, because you never know.  
Q: I want to talk about all three of thos
e things, but back to your citize -- becoming 
a citizen. It obviously was 
a -- a big deal to you. 
A: Yes. 

Q: It said that -- 
A: It still is and I take it seri
ously, not like some other people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
65
Q: It™s funny, it seems like, my mother 
included, all the -- the people that I know 
that emigrated here are more patriotic, for 
lack of a better word, than most of the 
native born people I know. Perhap s precisely because -- 

A: Because we know what it is
. We know what it™s worth. 
Q: Did you ever, back 
when you were in Europe decidi
ng what to do after the war, 
was there a time where you were really 
seriously considering going to  Israel 
because your father™s family was there? 

A: Yeah, I was, because most of my frie
nds were there. And there was, you know, 
we needed a country. 

Q: Have you ever in the interim regretted 
that decision to come here rather than 
going th ere or -- 
A: N-No. No, no, I never did.  
Q: You mentioned -- kind of going all over 
the place here, chronologically, but you 
mentioned earlier about wh en you were 
in Europe listening to th e radio and 
waiting for Roosevelt to come and help an
d it never happened. Did that in any way 
lessen your, I don™t know, appreciation for 
this country , to know that they had 
abandoned their -- I don™t know how to , what
 to call it, their du
ties, their -- that 
they had not behaved better 
toward the European Jews? 
A: Not lessened. I was probably a little 
bit disappointed th
at a big, powerful 
country couldn™t do more. 
But then , you know, as you 
live here, you learn about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
66
the country, you learn about political pro
cedure, so to speak and you can almost 
understand.  
Q: How were you treated -- yo-you menti
oned in passing about the -- y-you didn™t 
want to call them princesses, but there 
were some American
 born, presumably 
Jewish women that you were encountering 
that were less than welcoming to you, 
presumably because you -- you had an accent 
and your English wasn™t to -- to their 

mind -- 

A: Some still are, that™s really -- y ou know, people are very interesting. See, I -- I 
did a lot of phone wo rk, I m
ean answering the phone atwork over there. And it™s 
interesting how people react when they he
ar something different. So I sort of got 
used to it. You know, at first it w as botheri
ng me a little bit, but now I don™t care. 
You don™t like it, that™s your problem. Y
ou know wh en I woul
d answer the phone 
and on th e other end I hear, oh, 
did I detect an accent? I said, no, you hear one. Or I 
would say, you know, no, I don
™t think so. And then they 
wanted to know if I was 
from Germany, or from France, or wherev
er, you know. And then some people I 
would try to answer something, they 
said, I don™t understand you. I don™t know 

what you™re talking about. Okay.  

Q: Did you ever feel -- a-a-and if so
, how -- ill treated by other American born 
Jews here that you, you know, we -- es
pe -- like let™s say you moved to a new 
town, in your various moves, you kn
ow, to Flint and 
Michigan City -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
67
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and Syracuse, or wherever you were
 at, and here. How 
were you received by 
the -- the Jewish communities in the places that you went, as -- as immigrants, as 
survivors? 
A: [indecipherable] but it was very nice. We
 made friends everywhere we went. It -
- it -- it depends, it™s so different, you kn
ow, the kind of pe
ople you meet, in 
general. Some are nice, and curious and 
want to get to know you, some, don™t 
bother me.  

Q: Do you recall any incident
s in any of the places that
 you lived, ag-again getting 
back to how people, you know, would come
 to find out -- I mean, obviously  your -
- your husband has the tattoo. Did you 
have any memo rable encounters with 
people, I don™t know, neighb
ors, the grocery store -- 
A: No, not that kind, but I 
had thro ugh my  children, wh
ere we lived in Cleveland 
for a short time and my  son went to school
 there. And th -- he had a fight with a 

kid behind him who ca
lled him -- I was going to say a dirty Jew, but no, it was 
something else, but there was a Jew in it. Th
ey got into a fight 
for something. That 
was in Cleveland and then 
when  we lived in Delawa
re, Newark, Delaware, we 
lived in a very nice, almost new subd
ivision over there and th ere was another 
family somewhere not too far from our h
ouse whose -- the father was an army 
officer and they had two or three kids andone was as old as my  son and th ey were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
68
good friends. And there was a little boy 
who was my  Caryn™s age, the one wh o 
lives here in town now, and -- and she 
had an incident with the kid. She came 
home one day and she says to me, Mommy
, you know what -- I don™t remember 
his name any mo re -- what he to ld me on the way to school? I said, what did he 
say? She said, he told me
 that it™s too bad I wasn™t
 in Germany during the war 
because then Hitler could ha
ve killed me too. And then
 another day when the -- 
after that, sometime after that, the afte
rnoon when  they  come home from school, 
three comes my  daughter with a, you kn
ow, stack of books in her hand, with  a 
smile from ear to ear. I said
, what happened? She said 
well -- and says, that boy 
was bothering me again, was starting agai
n being a Jew and this and that and 
whatnot. And sh e says to me, I co uldn™t lis
ten to it any more, so
 I picked up my 
books and I hit him on the head
 with it. I said, good fo
r you. And that™s from the 
same family, two boys from the same fam
ily . So how do you -- how do you figure, 
how do you account for that? And the older 
boy would come to my  house and play 
with my  son, and then the othe
r one was hassling my  daughter. 
Q: What about not so much 
anti-Semitic incidents, but 
you know, moving to a new 
neighborhood, cause you moved so mu ch, 
and you know, people asking you about 
your surv ivor experiences, or it coming up
 in conversation or it -- neighbors -- 
A: It™s interesting, for the most -- mo
st people w-wanted -- they couldn™t hear 
enough about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
69
Q: Meaning they asked about it? 
A: Mm-hm. Sometime I think more
 so than the Jewish people. 
Q: Why do you think th at is? 
A: I don™t know why it is, but I noticed 
it, was -- I don™t know why, but -- but the 
Gentiles want to hear more about it 
than our own people
, even today.  
Q: Was there a time w h en you were reticen
t to talk about it if someone asked you 
and would -- would th -- was there a 
time when you would be less than -- 
A: Well, that depends who you talk to
. You know, there was some people you 
wouldn™t want to say anything. There were 
others who you feel that they genuinely 
interested, so youdon™
t mind talking about it. 
Q: I guess I was thinking mo re in terms of
 was there a time in your life where you 
or your husband were making 
a conscious effort to put 
it behind you and not talk 
about it? 
A: W-We were, probably the first maybe 15
 - 20 years of our marriage, we just -- 
just didn™t talk about it. 
Q: Well, that -- that an swers my ques
tion. That™s a large period of time. 
A: Yeah. We just di
dn™t talk about it. 
Q: What changed after 15 - 
20 years, what -- was there 
anything that spurred you 
on to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
70
A: I think people began to read mo re and 
began to hear mo re. When  the television 
came about, there were mo re things that
 came out into  the open, and people 
became interested. And then -- 
see, when my older kids 
went through high school, 
all through school, even here
 in Indianap -- in -- in I
ndian apolis from ™69 on, never 
a word was mentioned in sc
hool about it. Noth ing. In the early 70™s when  they  
started to teach in th e Su nday  schools, and that™s when they were start -- beginning 
to look for survivor
s to come and -- and speak. Bu
t up until then there was really 
nothing. 
Q: What was your first experience -- let 
me just check how we™re doing here, I 
think the tape is ending, hol -- [tape brea
k] What was your first experience doing 
any sort of public speaking about your ex
periences? Was this your -- being invited 
to your ch ildren™s school, or -- 
A: I think the first time it was I w as asked,
 it was here in Indianapolis already. I 
was asked to go to IHC, the Indianapo
lis Hebrew Congregation wh ere we belo ng, 
to talk to a Sunday school 
class, and before I got there,
 or before I was to speak, 
they were showing the film 
then -- oh God, I can™t reme
mber the title of it. All I 
know is the -- 

Q: ﬁNight and Fog?ﬂ 
A: Pardon? 
Q: ﬁNight and Fog?ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
71
A: Yeah. Thank you. And it was the first time
 I really saw pictures of that kind. 
And I was so shaken by it, 
was the word I think, that 
I almost couldn™t do my 
speaking. And then the othe
r one when I was a little bit 
more composed, when my 
youngest daughter was in j
unior high and she was in an accelerated class and th-the 
wonderful social studies teacher, and they
 were reading the Anne Frank story and 
also some other stuff relate
d to the Holocaust. And in 
one of those classes, the 
teacher asked the class if anybody knows 
anyone who was in a camp. And our little 
one put her hand up and said 
yeah, my parents were there. So the teacher wanted to 
know, so do you think your 
mother would come in and talk to us? So she called me 
and I said yeah, I™ll be glad to, sure. So
 we set up a time and I wrote up, you know, 
my speech, and went [indecipherable] did 
my speaking. And I know my daughter 
was very upset with me, cause she said, 
you sounded just like a teacher. But wh en 
the bell came and the class was over, the kids wouldn™t let me  go. They  had so 

many questions, they wanted to  hear mo re
. And the same night the teacher called 
me again, would I come back and tell them
 so me mo re.  And  th at
 was when I told 
my husband, I said look, I 
already told them what I 
know. Maybe you ought to 
come and hear what the kids have to as
k and you talk to th
em. And that™s when, 
you know, we really started 
to talk about it to other th
an us. And then, about the 
same time there was a -- a book that
 came out, ﬁThe Ho ax  of the 20
th
 Century,ﬂ and 
he got -- my husband got very upset ove
r that and he wrote a letter to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
72
newspaper and he wrote a letter to Northw
estern University. Of course, Mr. Butz 
never answered, but nevertheless he wrote 
a -- sent him a letter. And that™s when 
he started to come out.  
Q: And when would that have been , approximately? 
A: I think it was some where in the early 
70™s, I don™t rememb er exactly what year, 
™72 - ™73 - ™74, somewhere in there, in the 70™s. 
Q: And since then what sort of things 
have the two of you 
done in terms of 
speaking, or -- 
A: He is the one mostly who does the 
speaking, I™m not very
 good at public 
speaking. He is -- he is very go
od and he does quite a bit of it. 
Q: Well, let me rephrase the questions. 
Wh-Wh-What™s, other than your -- your 
daughter™s class, what sort of places
 have you gone over the years? 
A: Some social clubs, you kn
ow, not -- not too many places, really. I let him do the 
talking. 
Q: Can you talk about the lo
ng term impact that you th
ink your experiences in the 
Holo caust have had on you raising 
your children, perhaps, or tr --

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Agnes Vogel. This is tape
 number three, side A. And I was just 
asking Mrs. Vogel about the long term impa
ct that your experiences have had on 
you in different areas of yo
ur life. And the first I was 
going to  ask you ab out is in 
your family life and in raising your children.  
A: It™s like I said before, 
to make sure that they™re -- become independent people. 

We never -- tried not to teach them hate
. We™re both rather friendly people and we 
welcomed anybody who came in
to the house, so you know,
 we won™t hold grudges 
against people because that doesn™t get 
you anywhere. And I 
hope my kids will 
have enough common sense that they™ll know wh at™s right and what™s wrong. 

Q: How has it affected  your, I don™t kn
ow, we talked about politics briefly, 
citizenship, your -- your feelings abou
t government and the possibilities of what 
government can do and should do and should
 not do. Is it in any way shaped by 
your experience with what ha
ppened to you in Europe? 

A: [indecipherable] that™s -- th
at™s the thing, that you gotta
 keep your ears and eyes 
open. 
Q: How so? 
A: To listen to what -- not just what peopl
e say, but what they  do and what they 
really mean  when they say 
some --  say something, es
pecially in -- people in

government. So I go out and I vote for the be
st people I think there is to put in to 
places in the government. 
Q: Do you -- your -- you talked
 earlier about that small voi
ce in the back of your 
head that says, could this happen here.  
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Is that voice any quieter, dimmer than
 it was when you first came over here, 
when  it was fresher in your mind? 

A: No. 
Q: No? 
A: As a matter of fact it™s even more 
lou -- I think it™s -- it™s maybe louder now 
than it was before. 
Q: Why? 
A: Because of what™s going on out there 
and what™s happening in Washington and 
it™s what happening -- what™s happening in  the country . 

Q: What things are happening th
at are most co ncerning you? 
A: The right wing swing of the country . All these fringe societies out there that 

could easily, given time and a situation, 
God forbid, can easily become a bigger 
threat. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
75
Q: Were you -- I want to go back in histor
y and talk to you about some things that 
have happen ed, but do you 
recall how you felt when  this bombing happened in  
Kansas City -- excuse me, Oklahoma C
ity? Was that -- did that concern you? 
A: That was terrible. It was a horrible -- 
it -- it -- I mean, how 
can it happen in the 
United States? See, this is wh
at I mean, people like that.  
Q: Are there sounds or smells that you 
have encountered here that bring back 
memories for you of -- 
A: Sounds yes, smel ls,  no. But words someti mes.  
Q: Like? 
A: Maybe it™s something, that I hear some
thing and it doesn™t take much, it just all 
of a sudden like a movie, everything co mes back. 
Q: What kind of wo rds would do that? 
A: N-Not any sp ecific words,
 but you know, you read an
 article, you -- you hear 
something on television, and oh
, that™s it and off you go. 
Q: What about sounds, you said sounds, 
yes. Did you mean things other than 
word s? 

A: Like a big bang, an
 explosion, a siren. 
Q: And you™ve -- you™re hair stand up 
or you -- you -- yo
u -- or you have a 
flashback or you -- 

A: Yeah, you could call it a flash b ack. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
76
Q: Have you ever been con
cerned or -- or apprehensive or fearful, I don™t know, a 
knock on the door wh en you™re not expecti
ng it, or a phone call 
late at night, or a 
sp -- anything along those lines, or -- 
A: Not really. 
Q: Just wondering. 
A: No, not really. For the most 
part I feel pretty secure.  
Q: Is that something you™ve had to wo rk on 
at all, or are there 
any things you do, or 
-- that help you feel more secure, or th
ings that you and your
 husband have done? 
A: I think it just -- like I said before, I 
think it just evolved. We been, thank God, 

very lucky. We didn't  have many unpleasan
t experiences, as far as that goes. So 
you sort of become accustomed
 to being, you know, on an
 even -- what™s the word 
I want to use? 

Q: Keel? 

A: Sort of. 

Q: I wanted to talk to you about some 
-- oh okay, all right, let me -- I™m checking 
off these questions they wanted me to ask.
 Your dream life, have
 you been  troubled 
in your dreams by nightmares, or -- 
A: Oh, I have crazy dreams all th e time. But 
I™m not sure that it™s related to where I 
come from. Not necessarily. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
77
Q: So you don™t -- none -- yo
u don™t ha -- specifically 
have dreams that you™ve had 
over the years that -- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- related directly that you™re aware of? 
A: No. I had some -- a nightmare not to
o long ago, I woke up screaming, 
somebody was going to  come and get me. But I don™t think it had any relation to -- 
not consciously. 

Q: You went back to  Hungary some -- not -- many years later. 
A: Yeah, we went back, oh
, it™s about 10 years ago. 
Q: What was that like for you to go
 back  there after so many years? 
A: It was [indecipherable]. 
It was like I was in a strange country, like I™ve never 
been there before.  
Q: Just because physically it looked different, or -- 

A: Yes, yes, and it™s strange, I mean, things 
that I remember that 
I grew up with is 
not there any more. There was a big, beautif
ul street in the middle of the city, and 
we walked  through there and I looked and 
I s -- kept saying, it™s -- doesn™t look the 
same as I remember. It used to have, when
 -- what I remember, it used to have two 
rows of huge, beautiful trees, and in th
e summertime it would -- you know, all the 
branch es and th e green would come out a
nd then all come together, it™s like a -- 
Q: A tunnel? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
78
A: -- tunnel going th rough it. And I™m looking and I said, it™s not there. I kept 
asking, I said, what™s missing from here? 
And my  sister said to me, oh you™re 
looking for the trees th at™s 
no longer there, they cut it do
wn. And went back to the 
street where we used to live, and I na -- had 
such an eerie feeling.
 So that was that.  
Q: I know your husband went, did you go 
together to the Holocaust gathering, the 
survivor™s gathering in the early 80™s? 
A: [indecipherable] yeah. 
The one in Israel? Yeah. 
Q: Tell me about that. What was 
that like for yo
u to do that? 
A: That was emotional, very emotional. It
 was -- it was nice. At that time I was still 
looking, trying to find out wh
at happened. See, I have an
 aunt who we never really 
found out what happened
 to her and her daughter. That™s
 the sister of my mother I 
mentioned earlier whose -- the husband was 
taken away  in 1941
, I believe. They 
took him to the Ukraine. ™42 and early ™
43, the news came that he died. And my 
aunt was left with a small child who wa
s about four years old at the time and a 
daughter who was a young teenag er. And sh
e decided to  liquidate whatever sh e 
had over there and then to come to live 
with us, because they were very close 
[indecipherable] my 
mother. And she wanted to be
 with us til the war was over. 
And my  parents went in September betw
een th e high holidays, between Rosh  
Hashanah  and Yom Kippur to bring the ch
ild over to our home, 
so she should be 
free to take care of her business and th en
 would fo llow. Well, it took her longer 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
79
than she thought it would, 
and then around Christmas,
 December, th ey came over 
and -- Christmastime they came over and 
wanted to take the boy home and he 
wouldn™t go, he wanted to stay with us. 
An d  th en  in  th e sp ring
 my parents wanted 
to send the child back to 
her, and my  father almo st found somebody who was 
going th ere with her -- with his daughter and 
at first they agreed that okay, they™re 
going to  take a chance and take the child 
back. In the last mi
nute they said no, 
we™re afraid to take a child because if 
they find out you™re taking a Jewish child, 
we get in trouble too, so they didn™t ta
ke him.  And as it happened, he survived , 
today he is a doctor and he lives in Texas,
 and his mo ther and sister is gone an d we 
don™t know how and -- but they  died in Au
schwitz, both of them. And they were 
young en ough to  be able to survive.  
Q: What other things happe
ned wh en you went over th
ere, did you see people you 
knew, did you -- 
A: I met a lot of people I knew, yes, and 
so did my  husband. And I went to one of 
the museums in Tel Aviv ca
lled the dias -- Diaspora Muse
um. And to my surprise I 
found in one of the computers, my whole 
families™ history writte
n up. So that was 
interesting. And I saw my  aunts I had [ind
ecipherable] I haven™t seen since I was a 
small child. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
80
Q: Did you -- other than that gathering,
 have you had much contact with other 
survivors living here in the States? Do  you have any friends who are also 
survivors? 

A: I have a girlfriend I went to school 
with, she lives in New York, and that™s 
about it. I really don™t -- and the few here in town. 

Q: About how many people are there here? 

A: Real survivors? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Well, some of them already pa
ssed away. Not really a whole lot. 
Q: Five, 10 - 20? [indecipherable] 30? 
A: There are a few who came over here as young children befo re -- just before the 
war, came from Germany. But 
others [indecipherable] real
 -- real survivors are us 
and maybe three, four other people, that™s about it. 
Q: So th  -- what about in other pl
aces you lived before you came here? 
A: The only place that we met survivors 
were in Binghamton, New York, where I 
met some  people from my  hometown, and Clev
eland. Other than 
that, in Michigan 
City there, we were, I think, 
the only survivors there was. 
Q: Mm-hm. Well, I was just thinking it mu
st have been a -- a profound experience 
having had only sporadic
 contact with other survivors since you came here, to all 
of a sudden be there with thousands there in Israel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
81
A: Yes and no. In so me ways I think it 
was a relief, because you know, wh en  two 
survivors get together, the only thing they 
talk about, what they went through and 
what they survived. A-And I 
think in order to save your
 sanity, so to speak, you 
need -- you need some
 time away from it. 
Q: So it sounds like a blessing that -- th
at you haven™t had that many enco unters. 
A: In some ways. 
Q: I can understand that.  

A: That™s my husband. 
Q: Yes. Do you need  to communicate at 
all bef -- cause there™s more that -- 
A: I don™t know, how much 
mo re do you have to go? 
Q: Well, that™s really up to you. There ar
e a few key th ings that I definitely. Can 
you spare another 15 or 20 minutes? 
A: Okay . 

Q: Okay . I would ask you about a -- a handful
 of things that happened in the past 

50 years that -- that I™m wond
ering what your thoughts 
were about, or feelings 
about, as it relates to your own experien
ce. The bomb , the atom bomb . The -- the n 
-- the nuclear age, the -- the fear of annih
ilation that was so pr
evalent in the 50™s 
and you know, wh ere -- you know, the Cu ban 
missile crisis in 1962. What was that 
like?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
82
A: That was nerve-wracking, that was sc
ary. The Co ld  War was scary because you 
never really could trust the Russians, so th
e -- as far as th e -- what, the atom bomb 
in Japan, it was a terrible thing to do, but
 it had to be done, otherw ise we would 
still be fighting.  
Q: What about the -- the trials after the war, the Nuremberg trials an d other trials 
that happened with -- 

A: They didn™t catch enough of them.  

Q: Did you follow them very closely? 
A: Yes and no. See, the Nuremberg trials were what year? 
Q: ™47, I think? 

A: ™48? 
Q: Something in there. 
A: ™47 - ™48. 

Q: I think, yeah. 

A: Those were the years, I don™t know, I wa s really trying to find my self, so to 
speak. 
Q: Mm-hm. During that time when you we
re perhap s not so apt to be thinking 
about, talking abou
t what happened? 
A: Exactly. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
83
Q: Were you aware of how many Nazis cam
e here, and if so how did you feel 
when you s -- when yo
u learned of that? 
A: I was a little bit surprised and a 
little bit disappointed in the American 
government for letting them in. Th
ere were way too many in  here.  
Q: And they weren™t just here, they 
were, you know, working on NASA and -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- you know, the CIA and -- 

A: Well, they needed them, 
they had to -- those people th
ey had to  bring in because 
they need ed  the knowledge
. But even with that, wh
ere were our American 
scientists? 

Q: I have a general question to ask yo
u. Who do you blame 
for what happened? 
A: For what happened in --  

Q: The holo -- 

A: -- you mean fo
r the Holocaust? 
Q: Yes. Who -- who -- where is your anger directed? 
A: I think th e whole wo rld. There isn™t 
one person you can pick because all the 
governments in the world knew what wa
s going on and nobody did anything. It™s 
hard to believe but none of those smar
t people in the government couldn™t see 
through what Hitler was about an d they 
went along with him, country  after 
country? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
84
Q: Do you have any mo re
 anger to ward  the Germans than other people who 
collaborated  with th em or went along with them or -- 
A: I wouldn™t call it anger, I have no se
nse of being angry because that just 
destroys you. I feel sorry for them. 
Q: How so? 
A: That they have to live with this, maybe to centuries to come. 

Q: Have you had any encounters 
e v er with any younger Germans? 
A: Yes. We were in Germany a few ye
-years ago, my  husband was testifying 
against some Nazi people from the camp. 
We met some lovely German people, 
they didn™t know what to 
do for us. As a matter of fa
ct we became friends. And she 
practically saved my life while we were 
there because I became 
sick over there and 
she had a friend who was a doctor and you kn
ow, she -- she took care of me. So -- 
Q: Are you aware -- I™m assuming you ar
e, of the -- how the American Jews 
reacted to what was going on a
nd what they did and didn™t do? 
A: They didn™t do a whole lot either, did they ? 
Q: I was wondering how you 
felt when  you learned that. 
A: Disappointed I suppose, but then 
I don™t think it would have make any 
difference, because even though
 this is a free country, it™s still the govern ment that 
decides. It™s Washington who makes the deci
sions. So regardless of what they did, 
if they wo uld have done mo re
 than what they tried, if 
it would have been any help . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
85
Q: I™ve been told that there 
were Jewish leaders who went
 out of their way to lobby 
Washington not to let European
 Jews into the country, ba
ck in the late 30™s, early 
40™s because they were afraid of pogroms 
here and -- and the back lash cause of the 
depression, that there would be all thes
e immigrants coming over and taking jobs 
away from Americans and -- 
A: Well, you see, that started the trouble 
in Germany. That™s why it all started. So 
this is what I mean when I said earlier 
they -- that™s mostly
 -- see, th e Jewish 
people are not so eager to hear our 
stories, th e real American Jews.  
Q: Wh-Why do you
 guess that is? 
A: Hm? 

Q: Why do you 
guess that is? 
A: Well, that™s what it is, what you just me
ntioned, that they we
re lobbying not to 
have in the 1930™s. So -- 

Q: What a -- what about the conduct of Eu
ropean Jews who -- like the -- the Jew ish 
councils, the -- th-the people who -- I don™t know if you had any enco unter in -- in 
your hometown  wh ere there mu st have be
en Jews who were in charge of the 
ghetto? 
A: They were [indecipherable
] in every city, it -- that wa
s the same  everywhere the 
Germans went. But see, in -- in Hungary 
they  didn™t have mu ch time any mo re. 
That was -- everything was done in a hurry. Like I said, from March 19
th
, by the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
86
end of June there were no Jews left in 
Hungary, everybody was gone except the 
one who lived in Budapest. 
Q: So there wasn™t much  time for any sort of infrastructure to be -- 

A: There was no time for it, no. They were 
gone one, two, three. By that time they 
knew wh at they were doing and th-the
ir mach inery was oiled pretty good. 
Q: Back to things that ha
ppened in the interim, betw
een then and now. Were -- 
what was it like the whole McCarthy era 
and the red scare and the people who 
were being persecuted here for, you know, 
rumors that they were communists and 
wha-wh at did you go through with that? 
Did you know an ybody
 caught up in  that? 
A: Not personally, no.  

Q: What was it like to observe th at, ha
ving come from th e experience that you 
came from? 

A: Well, it was unsettling to say the least, 
because if it g o es one way it could go the 
other way, too. So  there we go. 

Q: Si -- explain that, if it can go one way it can go -- 
A: Well, if one -- one day 
you persecute the communists, the next day you gonna 
find somebody else to do the same for, right? 
Q: Mm-hm. What about the -- the way blac
ks were treated here, and the beginnings 
of the Civil Rights movement and -- what
 was it like for you -- I mean, there are 
very few blacks in Europe probab
ly, when you were growing up. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
87
A: I never seen any. One I™ve seen as
 a child, Joe Louis 
was in our town. 
Q: So what was it like for y
ou to come to this country 
and see the -- the segregation 
and the -- the way, in essence, the black
s were in -- they were -- the ghettoes -- 
A: Oh, talking about segregation, listen, 
when I came to this
 country in 1947 in 
Detroit, one of the nicest neighborhood
s, I rememb er standing with my  aunt 
waiting for a bus to go down to
wn, and I look across the street, a big, beautiful 
apartment build ing, and th ere is a plaque on
 the door. It said no dogs -- I™m trying 
to rememb er exactly how it was worded. 
No dogs, no Jews 
and no blacks allowed 
in the building. That was in 1947. And I tu
rned  to my  aunt and I asked, how could 
you stand for this? To me it was outrageous.
 But that took me 
awhile to -- like all 
of us who co me to this country, you 
know, from somewhere el
se and this is a 
whole different life, and to get to know
 it, where it came from and what it™s all 
about. No, it™s not fair, it™s not fair to 
treat anybody like that
, regardless of color. 
Q: I guess I was wondering if you felt any pa
rticular affinity or connection of -- 
watching the way they were treate
d, versus how you were treated. 
A: Connection, no, not really, because it™s 
tw o different things altogether. No, it™s -
- it™s not the same  thing, and you can™
t really bring it to the same lev el. 
Q: I sense I™ve touched a -- a nerve. 
A: No, not really, but it™s -- it™s 
not -- that™s n o t the same thing. 
Q: How is it different? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
88
A: Because it™s true they were treated badl
y, they were segreg
ated, some of them 
were lynched, but they weren't tak en as 
a group to the gas chamber as the Jews 
were. And that is the difference. 

Q: I guess I -- what I was asking -- I was not my self making the eq uation of the 
two things, I was wondering if you felt par
ticularly disturbed at all or anything, 
when you came over here to -- to see -- 
A: Yes, it was disturbing because no -- no 
human being should be
 treated like that, 

there™s no reason for it.  
Q: Were you at all, when the Civil Ri
ghts movement was happening, did you -- 
were you involved at all 
in that, or did you -- 
A: Involv ed? To some extent
, but I wasn™t involved in  a
ny of the marching as such, 
but you know, I was for it. 
Q: Just wondering. 

A: Abso lutely. 

Q: What about the whole upheav al that we
nt on around the Vietnam war and all 
the demonstrations and Kent State and yo
u know, the riots and you know, that -- 
that whole period abou -- of upheaval. Did 
that frighten you at all, did that concern 
you? Did that -- did you have any familiar -- 
A: Frighten me? No, but it was rather -- wh
at™s the word I want to use? This is 
America. That™s the United States. Pe
ople can do anything th ey want to. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
89
Q: Is that a good thing? 
A: In some ways it is, as long as 
they know wh at really matters.  
Q: I™m -- I™m winding down . What about 
th e whole Watergate scandal and finding 
out in depth the level of corruption 
and sh enanig ans that were going on? 
A: That just shows that you can™t 
trust the politicians in Washington. 
Q: So it wasn™t a particular
 surprise or shock or -- 
A: Not really. That was a shock because it happened in  the Un ited States and I 
guess in -- we™re supposed to be a little bit 
better than anybody else in the world, 
but I guess we™re not. 

Q: What about various -- how do I charact
erize them as a group
? In the past 50 
years there have been some ho
rrible things, either that we 
just learned about, like in 
the case of the revelations about what happ
ened with Stalin in
 Russia and all the 
millions of people that -- 

A: [indecipherable] that just 
a -- that™s another thing that
 nobody wanted to know. I 
was there. Some people knew about it. 
Q: I take it you did. 
A: Well, we heard stories.  

Q: Hold on, let me just check. I 
think I have to  turn  this over.

Q: This is a continuation of the Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Agnes Vogel. This is tape
 numb er three, side B. And I was asking 
you about things that have happened in te
rms of other -- I don™t know what to call 
them? Catastrophic events in history, such  
as the -- the various ways that Stalin did 
away with millions of people 
in Russia, in Soviet Union. 
A: Well, of course it was shocking, when so mething like this 
comes into theopen. 
Q: Or, you know, Mao in 
China or Pol Pot in Camb
odia, or Idi Amin, or -- 
A: And the starving of the ki
ds in what was that countr
y in Africa where all those 
kids were starving awhile back? 

Q: Just rece ntly? 

A: Well, it™s been a few years. 
Q: Well, Somalia, then -- that

A: Yeah, I think that™s the one, when a
ll those kids, children were starving and 
where was the world? 
Q: I guess what I™m wondering is, when 
you, over the years have learned about 
something horrible that™s in the midst of 
happening, like in Rwanda all the -- th ey 
were both, you know, massa
cring left and right the -- you know, the -- the two 
ethnic groups there. Or what 
has gone on in  the past five
 years in -- in
 Yugoslavia. 
A: I was just going to say -- mention 
Yugoslavia. Now that, when  we saw the 
pictures coming from there, we looked, 
I said, my  God, it™s like concentration 
camp. There was no reason for that either.  

Q: I guess my question to you is, when th
ose things have -- when you™ve seen 
those things in the news, or read abou
t them, does it frighten you, does it concern 
you that -- 

A: No, it makes you angry. It brings b
ack all the memories, all that we went 
through and it makes you angry th
at the world didn™t learn. 
Q: Have any of those events caused 
you to take any action, or -- or-or -- 
A: Action as far as what? 

Q: I don™t know. Giving 
money, mobilizing support 
for -- I -- I™m -- I™m -- 
A: For who? 
Q: I don™t know, I™m -- I™m inventing things
 here. I™ll take that the answer is no. 
Last question, I know I™ve taken a lot of y
our time already. No t my  last question,

but the last thing that they wanted me
 to ask you about history. What about 
observing Israel becoming its own count
ry in ™48 and then the trials and 
tribulations of the past almo st 50 years? 
A: It™s 50 years, you™re right. 
Q: Has that been -- have there been things 
that have happened  there that have been 
-- 
A: It will be 50 years next year. 

Q: Next year. Has -- has anything th
at had happened th ere concerned you, 
disturbed you? 

A: Everything th at happens there concerns 
me, of course. It™s a beautiful country 
and it™s long overdue. I mean, Jewish pe
ople need the country 
like that. And they 
work  very  hard for it, those people over there.  

Q: Let me rephrase the question, when  I 
said concerns you I -- I me ant disturbs 
you. 

A: Some of the thing that happens over there, yes.  
Q: Such as? 
A: Oh, all the problems and bombings they
 have, where innocent people, innocent 
children die for no reason. I mean, there is --
 there is no -- there is n o  reason for it, 
for that. That™s -- it™s a concern 
for, I think, the whole world.

Q: How did you feel when the -- th e whol
e Intifada started to happen and the -- 
how -- maybe I™ll ask in gene
ral how you have felt about 
the Israeli government™s 
treatment of the Palestinia
ns within their country? 
A: See, we just came b ack from Israel. 
And wh at we hear on the news over here 
and read in  the paper, it™s a whole different
 thing than  what goes on over there. So 
we really can™t -- can™t judge.  

Q: Okay . I™ve just got a couple of questions
 in closing to ask you and then I™ll let 
you to your dinner. 
A: Okay . 
Q: What would you like people to under
stand? So meone, let™s say of my  
generation who certainly did not go through
 what you went through. Or for that 
matter people who are of y
our generation, who were he
re, or elsewhere and didn't 
experience what you and your husband ex
perienced. Wh at would you like people 

to understand th at perhaps they  don™t 
understand or fu lly appreciate about the 
Holocaust and the experiences you had? 
A: Well, let me think.  
Q: Is there something you would mo st lik
e people to come away from hearing this 
interview understanding? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006
 
 
 

 
94
A: Not so much understandi
ng, but maybe more aware 
of what goes on in the 
world, and maybe quicker to 
react on what happens
 on the other side or wherever it 
happens. 
Q: Meaning elsewhere in the world? On the other side? 
A: I mean, yeah, arou
nd the world. Because the world is getting smaller every day. 
Q: The last question I was going to  ask 
you seems related to your answer, maybe 
you™re already an swered it. How do we
 keep this from happening ag ain? 
A: Tolerance, and be aware, and teach 
your ch ildren not to follow blindly.  
Q: So if a leader comes up who starts promising things that so
und too good to be 
true? 
A: Question it, and don™t believe it til you 
see it. And let™s hope th at the younger 
generations will be smart enough to
 see through so mebody like this.  
Q: Has there been anybody, any politician si
-since you™ve been in this country  
that™s particularly worried you or any 
not necessarily politician but figure that™s 
particularly ba -- concerned you, that 
could be, I don™t know, a charismatic enough 
leader to cause trouble? 

A: Yeah, except I can™t think 
of the name of the person. 
Q: Give me a hint.  
A: But there was one not too lo ng ago in th
e picture. Pat Robertson is one. Is it -- 
have I got the right name?

95
Q: Yes. Oh, hold it, wh ich -- wh ich Pat? 
There™s Pat Buchanan  and Pat Robertson, 
Pat -- 
A: Well, the both of them. One is the po
litician, the other [inde
cipherable] andthe 
other one the -- the religious gu
y, and they ™re equally bad. 
Q: Is that -- is one of those who you we
re trying to  think of or is there somebody 
else? 

A: [indecipherable] well, there are probab
ly  some others around th at not too well 
known at this point, but -- 
Q: Hm. By any chance, did you ever r
ead the book, ﬁIt Can Happen Here?ﬂ 
A: No. 

Q: It was written in the mid-™30™s about 
how a fascist state could start in this 
country. 

A: Sure.  

Q: And it™s quite a book. 

A: Did you read it? 
Q: Yeah.  
A: It is available in the library? 

Q: Sure, it™s by Sinclair Lewis. 
A: Oh. I think I™ll go get it.

Q: It™s -- it™s quite a book. He wrote it in
 the middle of the 30™s, two years -- 1935, 
two years after Hitler came to power, and he
 wrote a very persuasive scenario of 
exactly how da -- you know, the right politic
ian and the right mix of bad economic 
situation -- 
A: Mm-hm [indecipherable] 
that™s all it needs. 
Q: -- and the right people to scapegoat an
d the right crisis to mobilize the country 
and give the president th
e proper powers and -- 
A: The only hope in this co
untry is that -- w ho they g
onna pick for th
e scapegoat? 
Q: How so? 
A: Well, they can pick the blacks, they
 can pick the Jews, they can pick the 
H i sp an ics. W ho  th ey  go nn a p i ck ? 
Q: Well, there™s also the sort of generi
c, whoever the last people came into the 
door, you know, as the most recen t immigr
ants that are taking the jobs away, or 
whatever.  
A: Well, I guess we™re back to square on
e again, huh? There we
 go for the Jews, 
huh? 

Q: I really appreciate all the time you™ve gi
ven us this afternoon. This concludes -- 
is there anything you™d like to say in closing? 
A: Just one mo re thing. I hope fo r the go
vernment of the United States, that will 
stay forever what it was written to be.
