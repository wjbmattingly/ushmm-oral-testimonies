A: They write like a village very ofte
n. It was, you know, I am now a little 
surprised, because I have two monu ments. One monument was done very 
soon after the end of the war, and all 
the years what we were knowing from 
Moscow
 to 
Vilnius, 
and th en to 
Serei
 to this place, once a year definitely, 
in the summer, there was a monument. 
I have this mo nument and it was 
written that in this place was killed 
Œ were killed 100,900 people; men, 
women an d children. They say by N
azis and the other co llaborators. 
Q: Local collaborators. 
A: Yeah, local. And then they changed 
this monument. I didn™t see the new 
one because we already couldn™t go. 
And another lady, two ladies went 
from 
Vilnius, 
they are now in 
Israel, 
and they  sent me the picture. But I 
never could read what is written. A
nd so mewhere I found, because I have

And finally, I tried 
to see her. And I was in 
Chicag o
, because she lived in 
Ch icago, 
but I saw 
in 
Chicago 
another 
Serei
 wo man , a wo man  fro m 
Serei, 
and she was out of 
town , and I don™t know why, maybe 
because she left very young, I was 
dreaming to see her, because she was my
 friend, despite the differences Œ 
Q: Age. 

A: Yes, I was older. But she didn™t try, so I didn™t see her. But she went to 
Serei
 later, and I have ever
ything about her visit. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And there is a lot of new things, 
and there I saw what is written now. 
Q: What is written now? 

A: Now is written, first of all, not thou
sand, not 900, but 953, if I remember 
right. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And it says that that were Jews. 
Q: Rather than just Œ 

A: Jewish rather than the Œ maybe th
ere was right, the first one, may there 
were some other people, I don™t know.

Q: I can see whether we can find out for 
you, as far as th-the Œ the research 
that™s been done for that part, for 
Serei 
and the surrounding regions. 
Usually by now there has been some sort
 of investigation to find out more 
detail. 

A: The real numbers. 
Q: The real numbers. 
A: Maybe something changed. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I mean, there™s 900 Œ 953, if I reme
mb er right, approximately, but at 
least two times less. 

Q: Yes. But my question is, how larg
e was the community before the war, 
the Jewish community in 
Serei
? Was it a th ousand people, was it several 
hundred? 

A: Well, they were writing that it was 1900. 

Q: No, no, no, I™m not talking ab out 
those who were murdered, I™m talking 
about the town before 
World War II, or the village before World War II, 
about how large was it? Was it a b ig 
village, was it a small village? Were
