Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr 
collection. This is an interview with Do
ra Klayman conducted 
by Neenah Ellis on 
April 26
th
, 2004, in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Th
is interview is part of the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum™s post 
Holocaust interview project, and it™s a 
follow up interview to a USHMM videot
aped interview condu
cted with Dora 
Klayman in 2002. The United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making th
is interview possible. This is tape 
number one, side A. Dora, maybe you co
uld start here. We ended your video 

interview with your marriage, 
mo re or less, and we showed so me photographs of all 

th e family  memb ers w h o  came. 
Answer: Mm-hm. 
Q: Can you talk some about that day and 
wh at -- what was your -- what were -- what 
were your expectations? What
 did you think your fu ture
 was going to  be wh en  you 
got married? 

A: Wow. It was a very strange way that -- 
that I got married, to begin with, and I 
don™t remember how much time I had to talk
 about that. But I mentioned at that time 
that I met my  husband a year befo re, and we
 met on the train. All that was there, I

think. And so I haven™t actually seen him pr
ior to that, for a whole year. Prior to the 
wedding, I mean. For a whole year. He ca
me two weeks before our wedding. And I 
had never in  my  life seen a Jewish weddin
g, and I have never -- so I really didn't 
know exactly wh at was going to happen. 
And very differently 
from weddings that 
I™m witnessing now, including 
my sons. It never even occu
rred to me to think about 
arranging fo r anything or thinking about anyt
hing except my  dress. That was ab out 
the only thing I thought about. And everything
 else I sort of just let be. It™s like 
somebody -- was some body else™s thing to  do 
it, a sort of -- sort of like I was going 
to a party, and my col -- main -- my -- 
my  main concern was to think about, you 
know, Dan™s coming and how is that going to be
? Am I st -- am I truly, really in love 
or am I just making things up? Am I ju
st bored in Sw itzerland, or unhappy in  
Switzerland or lonely? Because, of course, 
I had come there only -- less than a year 

before and I™d left all my friends behi
nd in  -- in Croatia and Yugoslavia. Had a 
boyfriend whom I, you know, forgot the mi
nute I got on the train. Obviously it 
wasn™t a very serious thing. And I lived a 
totally, totally different life in Switzerland 
than I had ever thought I would live. I me
an, not only did I not
 know about Jewish 
weddings, I didn™t know anything about Je
wish period. And you know, I knew very 
little on -- my experience was one month in
 Switzerland before that, and I -- you 
know, a few years before that. So everythi
ng was sort of going to  [indecipherab le] 
plus I was going to  meet my  aunt and unc
le, who were coming in from Switzerland -
- from -- I™m sorry, from Is
rael, and I had never s
een them as a adult.

Q: Which aunt and uncle was this? 
A: That™s my father™s brother and my fath
er™s sister, both of whom decided to come 
in for my wedding. And so th
ere were so many different 
things. I mean, I have -- I-I 
have -- I had very little -- almost no contact 
with them. My aunt, of course, I didn't 
even see a -- at all after the war. I only had 
pictures, I knew she existed. My father™s 
sister.  
Q: Can you say their names? 

A: Lina. That was Lina who married a wi
 -- a Weesler, and I knew that she had two 
children and I had th e -- I had the daughter™s
 photograph with me when I was living 
in -- in Yugoslavia. Her photograph was le
ft because was -- had been sent to my  
maternal grandparents, must
 be. I don™t know how I got that photograph. And it was 
she as a child, and it™s a beautiful little girl with -- and she™s 
holding a gorgeous doll. 
And I had that after the war. And it was so
rt of like all -- like looking at Sh irley 
Temple, like a movie star or something, becau
se we didn™t have such dolls or such 
clothes or such anything. So  that was -- th
at -- that was my only 
image of -- of this 
aunt with  this daughter, my  dau -- my  cousin
 Dina who now lives in Israel. And her -
- her -- she had a brother, Rubin, whom -- 
whose picture I did not have and I -- he 
also now lives in Israel and of course, 
we now we know -- know each other. So -- so 

my  aunt was coming. And then  my  uncle wa
s coming, whom I last saw, I think as a 
seven or eight year old in Yugoslavia, b
ecause he came back from the prisoner of 
war camps -- camp. He was in Germany du
ring the war. He was in the Yugoslav 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079

army when the war started and so  he -- he 
was -- he survived as a prisoner of war, he 
came back. He married a woman he met ther
e in Yugoslavia, I think he may have 
known her from before. She and her thr
ee sisters had al l together survived 
Auschwitz. Oh, it™s a unbelievable story wh ich I can™t get her to talk about on tape, 
which I wish I could. They 
now live in Israel. But at that time he came -- he came, 
he found me in Ludbreg wh ere I was living 
during the war, and he -- I remember that 
he -- he tried to talk to me about going with
 him, and I refused to go. I reme m -- sort 
of remember that conversation. I -- I -- I ha
d that memo ry, and of course he left me a 
picture, which I have, which you know, beau
tiful handwriting says, this is a -- in 
memor -- to remember him by. And he™s 
wearing his army  unifo rm. So, all of a 
sudden this aunt and uncle were going to 
come to the wedding. So that was going to 
be that. And of course my m -- my fu
ture mother-in-law was coming with my 
husband on the boat. And her brother, who is 
-- who su rvived the war -- actually  th -
- my husband™s family left -- left Russia 
actually mol -- Moldavia
 -- Moldova in the 
early 1900™s, but this brother went to -- to France rather than to
 the States. And he 
remained in Paris studying medicine. As a 
physician went to Oran, to al -- Algeria, 
married there, had one child. And during th e 
conflict in Algeria with the liberation of 
Algeria from France, they came to live in Mars
eille. And they had 
a -- at the time of 
my  marriage, they had a 13 year old -- 12 ye
ar old son. So they were coming to th e 
wedding as well, and my  brot
her-in-law, whom I had met bef -- before he came to 
visit me one time in Switzerland. And ev
erybody, of co urse, had waited for my  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
6
brother-in-law Leon to -- to inform everyo
ne, you know, who is this person th at my  
husband was getting -- my  future husband 
was getting ready to marry. And Leon is, 
you know, he™s darling, he™s
 here all the time, we are very close now. But a -- he 
wasn™t very -- there™s a big joke that at th
e time he only wrote to them, keep smiling. 

That™s about what he sent to New York
. And we had a good time, you know, we -- 
we -- when he came to  visit, which was 
-- it would be before the wedding. And you 
know, we -- we rowed the boat and sang row,
 row, row the boat on Lake Geneva, 
and had a good time. But he -- he didn't  
tell me -- I mean, he was telling me things 
about Dan, but it was -- my future husband, 
but it was like, you know, sort of. So I 
had to de -- still depend on my letters, so he
 didn't  -- wasn™t very explicit. So -- and 
then of course -- so all 
these people were coming, and -- and Dan was coming two 
weeks ahead of time. And I th
ink my -- so my wedding memo
ries really go back to -
- mostly to that da
y when he arrived. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And getting ready fo r his arrival. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And that was more important than the we
dding itself. And that looms sort of large 
in terms of preparation and anxiety and -- 
and what was I going to wear and what 
was -- what was I going to look like and wh
at he looked like and do I reme mb er him, 
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.  

Q: It had been a whole year since you™d seen him, wow. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
7
A: Yes, almost, not quite. Yeah, we -- we me
t in the fall of the previous year. And 
this was -- yeah, it was almo
st a year, it was July 15
th
 -- I™m sorry, August 15
th
 that 
he arrived. We were married
 September one. So my  aunt
, who now lives in Israel, 
the one who just recently did this interv
iew with us. She remembers every single 
detail and tells it over and over and over agai
n. She sort of lived
 through that with 
me. And this was -- this was one sort of aspect
 also of the wedding,
 is that she -- she 
was very lonely in -- in Switzerland. She 
was married to my uncle, my brother™s -- 
my brother™s ha -- I™m sorry, my hu -- my fa
ther™s brother. That was Yoshi and she™s 
Monda. Monda and Yoshi surv
ived  Bergen -Belsen and ended up in Switzerland and 
had two children there. They
 lived from the beginning from hand to mouth, in fact 
they were in  those camps, the relocation 
camp s. And Monda got incredibly  -- I don™t 
know, I think I should say traumatized by 
the experience mo re-so than any of my  
other relatives. And her whole family excep
t for her sister was killed in -- in -- 
during th e war, and she found herself now in
 this new country  without a language, 
without any means and -- and having these 
children, and she became -- basically she 
-- she -- sh e spent all her time 
cleaning and cooking and ju
st taking care and cleaning 
to the extent of being really beyond no-n
ormal cleaning. I mean, to sacrificing any 
kind of -- mu ch social contact. And th ey liv
ed in this very closed Orthodox Jewish 
community, where she didn™t have true, tr
ue, good friends. And she tells me th e 
story that even my arrival was a sort of 
like they -- you know, th
ey were wondering, 
you know, how is this going to
 be, they didn't have mu ch money. And how was this 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
8
going to  be, you know, they have to supp
ort another person. And I was going to  the 
university and I needed a b
it of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I -- 
they were in Montre and I ha
d to travel to University of
 Lausanne by train. And th ey 
were able to get a little scholarship for me
 from the Jewish co
mmunity. But it was a 
very close community. And wh
at she found, and I™m telling you what she says to 
me, what she found that -- that I b ecame her 
best friend. Because at that point I was 
19 and sh e was 30 some -- could figure out ho
w old she was, but I can™t remember it 
now. An yway -- and wh en she fo und out th
at I had met my husband -- I mean my 
future husband on th e train and when the 
letters arrived, she went through that 
courtship with me, and almo st sort of vi
cariously lived through
 that. And so when 
the day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, 
sh e remembers in detail 
what I said to her 
about, you know, when he 
proposed and -- and you know
, where she was sitting. She 
was sitting in the -- she was working in 
the bathroom, cleani
ng so mething and I 
came and -- and told  her and just exactly 
wh at I told her, you know, and so it was 
like a big thing for her, bigger than  it wa
s for me. I was like, yeah, I™m getting 
married. Sort of a crazy 19 year old, 20 year old -- 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- by that point. So  th at I think, you 
know, she remembers in detail about -- and 

tells me all over againabout,
 you know, my  going to  -- to get Dan at the -- at the 
train station, you know, wearing a -- a two 
piece blue dress with, you know, that was 
-- that was perfectly ironed and my  nails we
re perfectly done, etcetera, etcetera. And 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079

it™s funny because -- and of course, I think I 
told on the other tape
 that one of the -- 
anyhow, I don™t know, that -- 
that one of the nice things
 that my uncle had done for 
me is that before Dan came and I met 
him again, my  uncle said, you know, th e 
wedding is all arranged for, which was fine 
with me, I hadn™t do
 -- done very  mu ch 
about that. And -- but you have not -- you kno
w, you think you want
 to get married, 
but if something doesn™t go right, you have 
tw o weeks and if you want to cancel it, 
it™s okay. 
Q: Oh -- 
A: Which was -- 
Q: That™s great of him to say that. 

A: That was very great of him to say an
d I appreciated it then and I appreciate it 
mo re as I am an adult and have ch ildren of
 my  own. Bu t he did say that, and so I 
have that in the background, so I was fee
ling fairly safe and 
okay. And now, as an 
adult I look back and everybody
 says, my God, what a ri
sk, you know, all of this 
thing was. But it didn™t seen to me that 
way at all. I mean, 
you know, you marry -- 
you meet somebody, you like th em
, and you just get married. 
Q: Did you have a sense of -- this was mo
re than 10 years afte
r the end of the war. 
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: But did it have a sense 
for you because of all your aunts and uncles being there 
who had survived , and even t
hough you were a child then, did it have any sense of 
continuance, and we -- of surviv ing, peopl
e having survived th
e war. Was there that 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
10
kind of a celebrat -- celebration as part of
 it? You hear people say this, people who 
got married in the late 40™s -- 
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- or immediately after the war. I™m wonder
ing if that attitude was at all present in 
your wedding? 
A: Probably less so. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Maybe because -- because it was late -- so
 much later and because I was so young 
when I lost my parents. And I lived with
 my uncle -- my -- my mother™s sister™s 
husband, whom I adored and he adored  me. And you know, I star -- I started my life 

with him wh en I was, you know, in elemen
tary school. So -- so
 I was in -- it-it -- it 
was, in a way, contrary to that i-in -- in a 
sense that he wasn™t going to be able to be 
at my wedding. So in a way, I -- I her -- I 
felt the absence of a parent, but not my  real 
parents, because it was so far in the backgr
ound. I mean, I know th
at that is how my 
uncle and my  aunt felt, and -- and to my
 uncle it was extremely important. That™s 
why, you know, my aunt tells me that to 
my  uncle -- and he had told me -- he passed 
away in ™9 0, but he told  me how important
 it was to him that -- that there was this 
continuation and th -- it was extremely impor
tant to them that 
I marry someone who 
is Jewish and that was behind their invitin
g me, much -- very mu
ch so. And that was 
said to me. You know, they wanted me to -- to meet pe
ople because they
 knew at -- 
my  aunt says that she knew that -- he knew th
at if I was left in Yugoslavia I wouldn™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
11
marry somebody Jewish and th at would be 
the end of th at. There was just nobody to  
meet there. And they though
t I would meet someone in 
Montre, through them. And I 
met people, but I had pre-empted it all by 
meeting Dan on the -- on the train. So -- so 
it was extremely important to them, it was --
 it was for them, because they were that 
generation to -- who understood it. I ha 
-- I-I don™t think I 
understood it fully. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I may have understood it after my child
ren were born, but at that time I didn™t 
dwell much on the Holocaust 
and on th e losses. I grew up
 happy and in school and 
just being fairly norm -- normal teenager. 
And I intellectually kn
ew, but emotionally 
I ru -- I -- y ou know, as a child
 I used to say things like oh, I have to do this. Now, if 
I had a mo ther, I wouldn™t have to do that
. Bu t that™s sort of mo re, you know, a kid 
thing, you know.  
Q: Yup. 
A: I can -- I-I think, yeah, I had more of 
a kind of a response 
like ma ybe divorced -- 
divorced ch -- parents™ child
ren have, you know? If I didn™t
 have this stepmother I 
would be doing mu ch better ki
nd of thing. Bu t some of it 
is totally unrealistic. So the 
fact that my uncle wasn™t coming to 
the wedding was sad for me. And I had 
originally when I -- when I 
decided that I would get marri
ed to Dan, I -- I -- I wou -- 
I -- I was -- I wrote to him with great tr
epidation about that. 
My Swiss fa mily was 
happy bec -- because Dan was Jewish and ever
ything. I translated all the letters and 
they knew  all the particulars, you know, 
and everything read well, so it was okay. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
12
But my  uncle, of course, knew nothing abou
t that. My -- my uncle -- my -- Dietrich 
is what I called him, so I™ll refer to him 
that way, probably easier. He knew nothing 
about anything until I -- and 
in our house it was like an
 unspoken -- ma, what do I 
say unspoken, it was a spoken word. You 
are not to get married until you graduate 
from the university. So here I am in my 
sophomore year and I™m getting married to 
somebody and taking off fre -- 
for -- for the United States
, leaving, basically, you 
know, him behind, which was mentioned in
 a very unkind way one of the books 
written about [indecipherable
] and about him. But -- 
Q: You™ve mentioned that before. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It just really bugged me. So -- but 
because I didn™t sort of say, oh I™m -- you 
know, I™m going to  leave you, which is
 circumstances, and I certainly did 
communicate with him from now on and -- a
nd [indecipherable] that. But -- but he 
couldn™t come because he di -- he was ju
st not healthy enough and -- and strong 
enough to  make the journey. An d he wrote th at -- you know, he wrote back saying 

that if I -- if my aunt and 
uncle in Switzerland felt that it
 was a good thing for me to 
do, then  it was okay. So I went ahead. Anyw
ay, so there are [indecipherable] sort of 
a [indecipherable] 
Q: Mm-hm. So you got married in September 1
st
, 1959, is that -- 
A: 1958. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
13
Q: ™58. And did you go imme
diately to the States then? 
A: Oh, it was very strange, it was -- it -- we 
couldn™t get my  visa on time, so we sort 
of spent a month in  Europe. I had to go
 -- well, we got a visa. Oh, there was 
American visa, of course meaning that you 
have to have your health checked, and 
then you have to go and -- that -- but al
so my passport was expiring, my  Yugoslav 
passport. So  we had to go to
 Geneva and extend my  passpor
t. And all of that took at 
least a month. At -- at one point it looked 
almo st as if Dan was going to have to 
leave without me. But we traveled -- w-we 
-- we traveled some, we went to some 
parts of Switzerland, we went to Lausanne
 and -- and we got -- 
we went to Gstaad, 
and went to Italy and then b
ack, so that that™s how we sp
ent the month. It was truly a 
honeymoon -- a moon, a moon, how a mo on 
[indecipherable] fast
. And th en finally 
the visa came and -- and th e passport was ex
tended and the visa came and -- and we 
were able to -- to -- to go togeth er. But 
I have to tell you -- I don™t know wh ether I 
said anything. I should have listened to th e 
end of the tape, but I don™t know wh ether 
I told you anything about what the wedding was like. 
Q: I don™t think so. 
A: No? 

Q: I don™t think there was anything like th at. 

A: Well, it was a very different affair from a
nything that happens he
re. It was in -- in 
the mo untains, in the Sw iss mountains, in 
-- in -- in a place called the Chateau Deux 
where there was the f -- ther
e is a family -- th ere was a 
family in Moltar, a Jew ish 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
14
family that ran a kosher ho -- a kosher re
staurant and -- a pensionne actually, and 
they also used to rent a -- I think it wa
s in theirs, a hotel in Chateau Deux for 
Passover. And I was there once at Passover before, wh ere you know, where 
Orthodox people would go to a hotel and sp end the entire Passover there so that they 

don™t have to do anything at home. And th
at™s where the weddin
g -- that™s where the 
wedding was to take place. And we all had to
 go up there with a little bus. And I had 
this dress on that I had designed by looking at -- because my  ha -- my uncle work ed -

- this is wer -- the work he found a -- in 
Switzerland. He -- they sent -- they sent 
people who were in these lo -- relo cation camps
 to learn a trade, and they sent him to 
learn how to be a couture ha -- cutter, a cloth -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- cloth cutter. So he worked for a Jewish
 family again in -- in
 -- in -- was a very 
close community -- a Jewish family that ha
d sort of a small couture house in -- in 
Montre and so I could desi
gn my  own dress, and it was 
made. And I -- Dan had sent 
me from th e States, ﬁB rideﬂ magazine and I 
did -- I sort of followed some of that, 
and I had th is pretty dress. And then you 
go up th ere -- we went up there with a bus 
and I had to  not see them for three days. Bu
t -- well, at least, because it was really 
longer that you don™t see people in  Or
thodox Jewish wedding of -- weddings, the 
bride and groom are not to see each other. 
And we ran, of course, all over Montre 
that whole time because this had to be done
 and that had to be done. And the town 
was so small we ran into each other all th
e time. But officially we didn™t see each 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079

other. And then he was to -- to get me 
the bouquet. And of course you know -- you 
know what it™s like here, I me
an, how mu ch  you go throu
gh to for the bride to get 
these flowers and you™re thinking about it.
 I told him I wanted to have wh ite 
carnations. That™s all I told him. I had no id
ea what to do and he 
had not the fo ggiest 
idea what to do. So, the afternoon before he
 goes to a florist and he said, I need a 
bouquet of white carnation. And they said
, well, how many do you want? He said, 
well, whatever is appropriate for a 
bride. And they practically fainted 
[indecipherable] at the florist shop. Star
ted running all over Montre apparently , 
looking for enough carnations to -- to make
 a bouquet, wh ich th
ey eventually came 
up with and put it together. So that™s what 
he brought. And th en there was a big fight 
about -- I think every wedding has to have
 a fight, and this one had to do with 
whatever hat he was going 
to wear. And he wanted to
 wear a yarmulke, which 
people here wear in Jewish weddings and 
that™s fine. But that  community and that 
level of observance called for a proper hat. A 
real -- one of those black hats, not a ha 
-- top hat, but you know, a hat. Well, he 
want -- didn™t want to wear one. So  there 
was a really tight situation, and finally hi
s mo ther persuaded him to wear it. And -- 
and he wore it just for under the chupah, that™s it. After th
at he took it off the second 
he could. Bu t he wo re it. And we we
re married by -- by the grand rabbi of 
Luxembourg, who had been a memb  -- who ha
d been a friend of the fami ly. And he 

came from Luxembourg to -- to marry us. 
And the chupah was outdoor, which is 
very proper in Orthodox Jewish weddings
. It was outdoors in a beautiful setting,

with you know, mountains in
 the background. And the entire Jewish community was 
invited, but not for dinner. Dinner was 
just the fami ly, but everybody was invited 
for, you know, right now I think th ey woul
d say this is a [indecipherable] wedding, 
you know, because you had little sandwiche
s and drinks and th
at was -- you know, 
that was that and everybody came out. A
nd -- and then there was a family -- there 
was a family dinner after that. So -- and then
 after that we took our [indecipherable] 
on th e train and that was that. That was the wedding. 
Q: And your smiling, it was -- it was a good memo ry. 
A: Oh, it was a great memory. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I loved it. To me, it was -- except a horri
 -- I had a horrible headache on the way 
up and I had to sit there -- that™s anothe
r thing of Orth odox Je
wish weddings, you 
have a separation of the -- of the sexes and I -- I -- you sit there -- I™ve not -- now 

seen it many times, you -- you sit and the -- 
all the fema les come and say hello and -- 
and you -- you sit with your 
-- you know, with your veil up and -- or down, actually, 
I have pictures, and just, you know, talk w
ith people. And you -- 
you were led to the 

chupah by two females and a man by tw o male
s, rather th an, as we do mostly in the 
States, and certainly the way my  son got ma
rried, the -- the -- the parents take you. 
Both  parents, you know, and -- take you -- 
take the bride and the groom. And th e -- 
the -- the father gives the bride away, none 
of that [indecipherable]. So my  aunt and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
17
my mother-in-law took me to
 the chupah . And my  uncle and I think Dan™s brother 
took him to the chupah. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Or maybe it was his uncle, I™m not sure
. I don™t rememb er. His uncle and aunt 
from -- from France, who came. 
Q: Uh-huh. Was there something symbolic ab
out the carnation, or was it just a -- 
A: No, I just liked it. 
Q: -- favorite flow -- okay, I™m gonna
 st-stop the tape and flip it over. 
 End of Tape On e, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Dora Klayman.
 This is tape number one, 
side B. So you, after you 
had a month of traveling and 
getting to  know each other -- 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: -- you came to the States. To New York? 
A: Came to New Yo rk. Was quite an 
experience. After the -- the -- you know, 
beautiful Sw itzerland and -- and the lake and 
this and that and we spend time in the 
mo st love -- the loveliest parts of Euro
pe, to come to New York, which I was 
looking forward to, but I was 
afraid that it was going to 
be gray an d ugly, sort of 
very Euro pean, but huge. And we came on 
a ship, we came on the Queen Mary, and 
-- and a -- I-I think if -- if I have to talk 
about experiences in co
ming, I think I have 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
18
to go slightly back to qu
 -- to queen -- to the queen 
-- the Queen Mary. It was -- I 
was so afraid to go on 
a ship because on my  trips during the summer in Croatia, 
when  we used to go to the island of So
lta, we once went on a boat that took th ree 
hours from Split to Solta, which you ca
n see from one another. It was like boom-
boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-
boom, you know, and ever
ything was there, you 
know, and sometimes goats and vegetables
 and ev erything, and it was just, you 
know, a -- a small boat. And I would get -- I would get seasick, and so I was very 
afraid of being seasick on th e way. And Da
n assured me that I wasn™t going to  get 
seasick because these ships are very big and 
they don™t rock and 
so on and so  forth. 
And I reme mb er in la -- getting, you know
, close on th e small boat that you go to the 
small boat to the ship and lo
oking at this ship and sayi
ng, my  God, it is enormo us, 
it™s like a h uge skyscraper or something. A
nd so I was reassured, but we did run one 
day into a hurricane. It was fall, th e hurrican
es are there, and near Ireland we ran into 
a hurricane, and Dan, who claime d he was 
never sick on ships, 
got very sick on a 
ship. Both of us were sick
 for the day. And then I ha
ve, you know, very sort of 
Americanization memories o-on thatship because it was now -- it was now a 

different world already, it wasn™t just the 
arrival, it was already -- it was, you know, 
being -- being on foreign territory all by my
self, and having to sp eak English all the 
time, and -- 
Q: How was your English? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
19
A: My English was good because -- I me an 
decent, because I had studied  English all 
through high school. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And I was an English major in college. 

Q: Oh.  
A: So --  
Q: Great. 

A: Yeah. So one of the reasons I met Dan is
 because I was dying to speak English to 
somebody. I -- I had met him because there we
re -- I think I talked
 on the tape about 
the discussion he was having on the sh
ip with somebody 
and everybody was 
listening, it was [indecipherable] in Little Rock
 and all of that and I was dying to talk 
about things. So I sort of took little walks 
until he started  talking to me. And so I-I -- 
you know, because I had -- I had studied 
English for a long time, but I had no 
experience actually speaking. There were 
no Americans or Eng
lish speakers, and I 
was one of the very few stud
ying English at that time in
 Yugoslavia. So -- so my 
English was decent, but there were many 
things I didn™t know. I mean, lack of 
vocabulary, you know, and -- oh, and -- an
d the thing th at really improved my  
English by the way, is while I was -- while
 I was still in Switzerland and we wrote to 
each other, and I -- I have these things, I 
would -- I asked Dan, 
good student that I 
am, I said to him, please corr
ect my letters. And so what he
 did is -- is -- in -- he 
wrote me corrections back, 
but not just, you know, ever
y correction, but he would 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
20
write me, for example, when you say some
thing like, I don™t know, I am at my  
second book, you don™t say at
, you say on. I am on my  second book. And then he 
would give me a whole le
sson on -- on prepositions. So
, even during our -- our -- 
Q: He was a good teacher. 

A: -- courtship, I -- I -- I learned -- I learne d a lot. And I spoke with a reas -- with a 
somewhat British accent, from 
wherever, and I was still on aunt and cahn™t, but I 
corrected that when I got 
here. So, my  English was okay, but I lacked vocab ulary 
and I lacked cultural knowledge, and -- an
d -- and that was one of my  -- my  low 
points on that ship that I remember. Sitti
ng one evening in one of the lounges and 
there were a number of Americans, and th
ey were sitting around the piano and we 
were included, sitting around the piano an
d someone is playing 
the piano and they 
are singing American songs. And I knew some
, but I didn™t know as many as they 
did, of course. I knew, you know -- well,
 anyway, it doesn™t matte r,  but you know, 
just -- just American song
s, from s -- from sea 
to shining sea and whatever they 
were. And I was never very good on my -- 
on memorizin g  voca -- 
words anyway, so 
that was enjoyable. But then Dan s -- orde
red a ginger ale. We were sitting at the 
table, he ordered ginger ale and I said, what
 is ginger ale? And he said, well, you™ll 

see when it comes. I said, well, what is it? And he™s, well, you™ll see when  it comes. 

And I started crying. And I so remember that.  
Q: Why? 
A: All of a sudden -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
21
Q: You just felt frustrated, or -- 
A: -- all of a sudden -- and he was terribly fru
strate -- I mean, he was very upset that 
he had upset me. But a -- it -- it -- it -- th
en somehow all of a sudden everything 
came together. My God, I don™t know anything ab out this country . I don™t even  
know wh at someone orders at the table. 
What am I going to do? S -- and you know, 
he comforted me and then the ginger ale came and that was the end of that story. Bu t 

I do -- I -- it -- it was sort of like, you 
know, you -- I remember a few little things 
that sort of were these kind of very sma
ll things. You think you, as an ESL teacher 
all my life later on, I was always aware how 
small things count. Just nothing counts -
- nothing -- nothing [indecipherable] can trig
ger you, trigger that sense that you are a 
foreigner in a foreign co untry and that yo
u don™t really know everything, and -- and 
how mu ch, you know, you miss 
and it doesn™t have to do -- it does -- has nothing to 
do with Shakespeare, it has 
to do with ginger ale.  
Q: And at that age too, it™s a kind 
of time when you want to belong -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and fit in. 
A: Exactly. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Exactly. And I -- I didn™t -- you know, 
I rememb er watching ﬁFan tasiaﬂ on that 
ship, that was when it -- 

Q: In theater? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
22
A: -- was in its original -- on the original 
version in the th eater on -- on Queen Mary. 
But then we came into New Yo
rk and I have pictures of 
myself on the sh
ip with the 
Statue of Liberty behind 
me, early in the morning. 
Q: What was that like? 
A: That was fantastic. That was just fantas
tic, you know. It was 
just exactly what I 
expected, you know, the -- ob
viously the statue is such a powerful symbol all over 
the world and it was then as
 well. And, you know, seeing it was just amazing. And 
then we come to New York . And, you know,
 people always say, oh, my  goodness, 
it™s -- New York is ugly, but 
I thought it was actually very
 beau tiful, because I think 
I expected to be gray and it™s actually very
 colorful. And instead of disliking all the 
wild colors and red bricks and -- and ther
e weren™t graffiti in those days, but you 
know, posters and -- and advertis
ing and you know, all of that
. It was sort of -- it was 
exciting. It was exciting and I loved it. 
And Dan™s parents waited for us and some 
other relatives.  
Q: And this was October? 
A: It was October. 
Q: Beautiful time of year. 

A: Yeah, it was a beautiful time of the 
year. And I remember very mu ch it was 
October, because I remember witnessing my 
first Halloween very shortly after that. 
But anyway, we went to -- to Dan™s parent
s™ apartment and that
 was a shock. They 
lived in a very small apar
tment in a northern -- northern part of Manhattan across 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
23
from -- from Fort Tryon Park. That was the 
Inwood section of Washington Heights -
- 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: -- where a lot of Jewish community had 
settled. And my fathe
r-in-law had a small 
drugstore around the corner 
from where they lived
. But they never 
-- they -- they 
lived not in -- they lived in
 an apartment to which they
 moved wh en the kids were 
little and they never moved out 
of there. And was very sm
all. It was 
a one bedroom 
apartment and I™ve never lived in a one be
droom apartment before
 in my life. So 
here I come to the land of -- of -- of milk 
and honey and these people aren™t living as 
well as I w as used to. I grew up in a big 
house, and -- when I liv
ed in Zagreb  and I 
was roomed with friends, they -- was in a 
-- they -- the govern ment had taken mu ch 
away from them, but they had 
owned that villa that they
 lived in, and they also 
owned the land -- the little villa on the sha 
-- Solta. So, it was, you know, even 
though it was small, it was 
beautiful furniture and it overlooked th e garden  and -- 
and my  au nt and uncle in Switzerland wh
o were really not well-to-do, had two 
bedrooms. And the boys had 
one and they  had one and I 
was -- I slept on the couch 
in the living room for the year I was th
ere. But now, my in-l
aws lived in a one 
bedroom ap artment with a tiny, tiny kitchen in
 an old house. In 
an old -- I mean  old 
house, old build ing in
 New Yo rk th at overlooked a co
urty ard, and you know, all the 
old build ings, the way they are. And my  mo
ther-in-law was sort of immovable in -- 
in terms of moving anywhere. I mean, eventu
ally we got them to move here, but she 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
24
wouldn™t change apartments and she liked
 where she was and she didn™t -- changing 
a chair was like a majo r issue. And so they 
just continued living there, like they did 
when da -- when they first 
started out. But it was across fro
m the -- from fo
rt -- Fort 
Tryon Park and my  husband adored the cl
oisters and spent time when he was at 
home studying there. And -- 
Q: And where did you and he
 live when  you got there? 
A: I wa -- we moo -- we move
d to an even worse place. 
Q: Did you move -- did you stay
 with them for a short time? 
A: No, no, no -- 
Q: No. 

A: -- we didn™t. We didn™t because what ha
d happened was that 
my husband, when 
he met me he was just returning from India 
where he had spent a year as a Fulbright 
doing [indecipherable] work  at the school of
 tropical me dicine on Calcutta. And he 
took a very long way home and met me on the -- on the way. He went up to  Japan 
and then  to -- went to some -- he took I 
-- I don™t know what kind
 of boats and went 
to Egypt and then he 
was in Turkey [indecipherable] wa
s in Turkey on that trip and -
- and to Italy and even tually to Yugoslavia, 
back to Italy where he
 to ok  a sh ip  to  go  
home. And anyway, he a -- he had tried after 
that to find a job that he would -- that 
he wanted  and it took a very 
long time. It was the time of what he used to call the 
Eisenhower depression, and -- not depr
ession, it was, oh what they  calling? 
Recession, sorry. And it was very difficult and 
he wanted  to have a research job, and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
25
he couldn't -- he didn™t really want to 
work pharma -- pharmaceu
tical companies. He 
had done that during hi
s graduate days and he just di
dn™t want to do that again, he 
wanted an academic position. It was very ha
rd to come by. He had been waiting for a 
position at NIH and it didn™t come. While we were in Switzerland, he got a --a 
telegram saying that the position had opened  
and he is in at NIH, but it was too late. 
Because we were getting married, he took 
a position to teach at Hoffstra ha -- 
College, which is now University of Long
 Island. And he knew th at that wasn™t 
going to  be great, but he took it anyway
 because, I mean, we had to live on 
something, and I certainly didn™t have any 
money. So , he talked to some friends who 
said they would find us so
meplace to live on Long Island.
 So when we came, there 
was a place that they had sublet for us, and it was a sublet in someone™s house. It 

was a second -- on the second story of some
one™s house. I mu st have been in  love, 
that place was ga -- ghastly, you know. But I had ha -- I think I had a very typical 

American experience, people all -- pe -- 
so many people tell me about their horrible 
first year. 
Q: First place [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I had -- I had one,
 but I wasn™t exactly expecting it. So 

this was -- Mr. and Mr. -- Mr. and Mrs. O™
Connor and we had 
to go through their 
living room and the television 
was always on, to the sec
ond story. And it was filthy, 
and I spen d the time -- I have just come 
from my super clean u -- eat off the floor 
aunt, and here it was like, you know, cockro ach heaven . 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
26
Q: Oh my. 
A: And anyway, we cleaned it up. It was a 
-- it was just a one room, one kitchen, 
share bathroom. And we didn™t have a car, a
nd -- to find something else, so it was a 
very difficult few months. Even
tually -- that was winterti
me and -- and we used to 
go do every -- all th -- our shopping taki
ng buses and it was pretty cold and 
miserable. And eventually, however, we were 
able to somehow find
 an apartment. It 
was very difficult to find housing. We we
re in Hampstead, Long Island and it was 
almo st impossible to find anything. Every 
time we would come to an apartment it 
was already taken. And even tually we foun
d something in a smal
l building that had 
six small apartments and the -- Mr. [inde
cipherable] said we could have this 
apartment, but he wasn™t going to do anyt
hing. No  painting, no nothing, take it or 
leave it, and so we did, we took it. And 
then finally by -- by -- 
by March, thank God 
a refund from the government, for -- on his taxes,  and we were able to buy this hou -
- incredible car, which was lik
e a ™51 Buick, I think. And 
it had a -- that -- you know, 
at least went, if nothing else. And in -- in
 the meantime, you know, we would take 
buses and stuff, and he took a long time to 
get to work every da
y and he hated it at 
Hoffstra. Not that he -- he doesn™t di -- he didn™t like it because he was teaching 

freshmen and he really couldn™t understand
 at all kids, like I eventually got to 
understand because that™s often what I had is
 kids who just weren 't g o ing to study, or 
didn™t feel like chemi -- and chemistry™s 
hard for most kids. And none of -- none of 

them were devoted to chemistry, it was ju
st a subject they were taking. And, you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
27
know, he was -- an-and he was extremely enthusiastic about chemistry. To him it 
meant a lot and -- and they were just, 
you know, coming up with you know, my  dog 
-- the dog ate my  homework, and he couldn™t 
understand that at a
ll. Sohe didn't like 
it very much there and had im-immediately 
applied fo r other situation in  the gover -- 
situations in the government. And of course
 the pay was extremely low, so that we 
couldn™t really afford anythi
ng. It was -- it w as difficult to
 -- to -- to buy it -- to -- 
you know, to buy any furniture
 or anything. And we -- we
 bought something, but not 
very much. And -- so it was -- it was kind 
of hard. And I -- I was h o me alone and I 
had -- I could have started going to Ho ffstra, but it was already in progress and I was 
really scared. I had ju st gone thro ugh th is
 whole year in -- in Switzerland of coping 

with a new university where they  required 
me to know much mo
re French than I 
knew. I was doing [indecipherable] of the 
text of Proust and I could barely speak 
French because I was an Eng
lish major and I had done ve
ry little French before, but 
they couldn't care less. You™re
 second year French, you ta
ke this. You know, there is 
none of th at. I mean, you -- American un
iversities coddle kids in comparison. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Of course I didn™t understand that they 
also didn™t expect me to take any ex ams. 
Just -- you know, just you fl
a -- you know, you™re just th
ere. But -- but so it was 
actually lonely for me, and I 
waited for Dan to come home and I decided that I might 
as well have a baby. What else was there?
 You get married, you have a baby. So I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
28
got pregnant right away. And Wanda wa
s eventually born 
on our first wedding 
anniversary. 
Q: Wow. 

A: So -- well, being pregnant meant you ha
ve to find a doctor and you have to  pay 
the docto r and I have an  -- had an  idiot, but 
that™s not because we 
didn™t pay him, we 
did, but he was just bad.
 And we pay -- tried to -- 
we painted our apartment 
ourselves and -- after we got tired of taki
ng a shower and ending up with brown dots 
on our heads because the pa
int was dropping do
wn, you know. So we painted and 
we had some furniture. But 
then things got really ex
citing because Dan got a -- a 
position at Walter Reed and he said he coul
dn™t come until June because he had to -- 
he promised to be at Hoffstra til the end of
 th e school year, and they  said they would 
wait. And so that was -- that was great. So
 by June I was alrea
dy highly pregnant. 
Wanda was born at the end of August. We 
took whatever possessi
ons we had and we 
headed for Washington
. And th at was great. 
Q: Yeah. So you were here in hot summer. 
A: We got here in a hot summer with ve
ry little to no money. We borrowed some 
money. 
Q: What -- what kind of job did he get? 

A: As a researcher. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
29
A: In -- in a lab at Walter Reed, which -- wh
ere he remained for the rest of his -- for 
the rest of his life. 
Q: Oh really? 

A: Yeah. Not in -- in that lab. He came as a -- as a researcher, 
he eventually headed 
the lab and the section. And they  were wo
rking on -- it was a-again a no -- tropical 
medicine. 

Q: Oh, really. 

A: Which is what he was interested in. 
Eventually he -- he 
worked in selenium 
chemistry. He had a -- his Ph.D . had to 
do with -- w-with e-e-extracting a new 
alkaloid from opium. 

Q: Hm. 

A: And so th at kind of tropical me dicine wa
s of interest to him. Even tually he ended 
up work ing on an ti-ma larials. Bu
t they -- at Walter Reed at that time they were also 
doing an ti-nuclear medicine. So I think I™m
 saying it right, because it was a long 
time that -- that they were 
working on that. Th
ey were thinking ab
-bout how to -- of 
course it™s the army , so they were always
 thinking in terms 
of, you know, what are 
we going to be afflicted with 
that we have to counteract. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And so th e medicine was going in -- in 
-- the research was going in the direction 
of if there is a nuclear attack -- and they
 were still thinking a lot about that, it was 
still after th e 50™s and after McCarthyism. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
30
Q: So it was tre-treating people who had been  -- 
A: Who had been  -- 
Q: -- exposed to radiation. 

A: -- exposed to radiation, right. 

Q: Oh. 
A: So it™s anti-radiation, that™s what it™s really called. 
Q: Right. 

A: That™s anti-radiation. So anti-radiation an
d then eventually that
 kind of died down  
and they went more into doing anti-malari
als and that™s where really he did. And 
anyway, so th -- so w-we came to Washin
gton and I will never forget the hotel we 
stayed in. It was on Dupont Circle in thos
e old, old hotels before they were all 
destroyed. And barely any air conditioning
 and the temperature was high and I was 
very pregnant, and huge. An
d it was hot. But, we went to Walter Reed, and right 
next to Walter Reed there we
re these apartment houses and there were plenty of 
apartments to be had. It was unbelieva
ble. And we got, right across from Walter 
Reed -- I, of course, didn™t arrive -- right
 across from Walter Reed
, there was this -- 
what it was called? A garden apartment th
at was beautiful and light and had two 
bedroom and a big living room and -- and 
a patio. And it was the same amount of 
money, it was like 115 dollars, I remember it
. It was the same amount of mo ney like 
that hole in the wall in Ne
w York. So, I was thrilled. 
And of course, I had been 
lonely and I™ll never forget that Dan went
 to work and he could walk across the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
31
street to work and somebody came a
nd knock ed on my  door, and there was a 
neighbor from upstairs with -- pregnant, an
d with a baby on her arms, and she said, 
oh I heard you moved in, welc
ome. I was like -- I thought I was going to  faint. No 
one talked to me in New York, ever. 
Q: Huh. 
A: On Long Island. It was a strange commu
nity. I -- I don™t think this is true that 
people in New York don™t ta
lk to you, but it happened to
 have been my  experience 
in that particular town. So, well, it was just
 the people that were there and there were 
no ch ildren and so on. But it was a 
different life in Washington. 
Q: So things turned 
around pretty quick ly. 
A: Very quickly. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It was like totally on the dime. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The place was full of young physicians
 from Walter R eed and their wives and 
their children and I made some lifelong -- lo
ng friends. And, you 
know, that was just 
totally, totally different life. 

Q: Did you join a 
Jewish community? 
A: No. 
Q: No.

A: No. We did not join -- join Jewish 
community. We went to services, Rosh 
Hashanah, but to just whatev
er was free and open and ther
e we -- there always were 
some in town, but that™s all we did. 
Not until we moved from 
there, when Wanda 
was four and we bought a house and we mo ved 
to wh ere we are now, into -- to this 
community. And -- which is across fro
m -- w e are across from Ohr Kodesh 
congregation. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And we joined, or -- 
Q: Which is over on East-West highway. 
A: It™s right on East-West highway. We jo
in -- and we -- we -- our house was just 
around th e corner from this house. This hous
e was built in ™79. But we moved into a 
three bedroom, small Maryland type house th
at -- that at that time cost 18,500. And 
was in -- it™s insane. It just 
sold for like almost half a mi
llion dollars, ridiculous. But 
anyway, we moved into  that house and we 
joined Ohr Kodesh , and that™s where the 
kids went to -- and I™m still a me mb er no
w, I™m much more ac
tive now than I was 
then, and -- and the kids went to Hebrew
 school there, and were Bar and Bat 
Mitzvah eventually. I had the -- that daugh ter, of course, that summer, and -- Wanda 

was born and then Elliot was born  a year and a half later. 

Q: So, ™60 -- late ™64 -- 
A: ™59, ™61. 
Q: ™61? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
33
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Wanda was born within the first year. 

Q: Right. 

A: We were married in ™50 -- in the fall 
of ™58, Wanda was born in September ™59 -- 
I™m sorry, in August of ™59. 

Q: Mm. 

A: And Elliot was born in March of ™61.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And that was the end of children. 

Q: Mm-hm. So the 60™s were
 raising kids for you. 
A: 60™s were raising kids. 
Q: Little kids. 
A: Little kids. I did things he
re and there. I started -- I di
d that little work for VOA. I 
don™t rememb er how I found 
them, or they found me. 
Q: But that was in the 60™s -- 
A: That was in the 60™s. 

Q: [indecipherable] translation? 

A: I did a lot of translation at the time for 
the Joint Publications Research Services. It 
was Department of Commerce. And th at wa
s excellent because I could neither type, 
n-nor -- nor nothing. I -- I couldn™t type. 
Bu t it had to be perfectly typed and I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
34
couldn™t do that. So I lon -- wrote longhand 
translations the best I could and then  
edited them. And did a lot of wo rk, but I re
ally learned English that way. And th-
then I gave it to somebody to type. So, wh
atever they paid me
 I shared with the 
typist. And so it was something -- something 
for me to do that -- that was sort of 
intellectually challenging and making a 
tiny bit of money. And that™s that. 
Q: By that time -- did you feel 
like an American by that time? 
A: I -- I think so . You know, differently fro
m very many people who come to this 
country, and I certainly have had mu ch 
experience with that, because I ended up 
teaching ESL, I -- I did -- I did not have 
anybody who sp oke my language, or who 

came from my culture. 

Q: So you didn™t have 
those constant reminders. 
A: I didn™t have those constant reminde rs. And I wrote home -- in quote home, less 
and less than my friends. And I got very i
nvolved with other mo thers, and with, you 
know, what was going on with my kids. 
Q: And your husband™s family, too? 
A: And my husband -- well, my  husband™s fa
mily, there was nobo
dy in Wash ington, 
actually. At fi -- one short period of tim
e a cousin was here, a cousin of my  
husbands. And they had a little b oy -- and they
 still have him, but they ha -- they had 
a baby at that time, and th
ey lived in Arlington and we
 saw them someti mes. B u t a 
very good friend of my husband™s from high
 school -- junior high school and high 
school settled here. In fact
, they™re the ones who always pushed my  husband to  come

and work  for the government. He was one 
of the early arrivals to the Washington 
area to work on the computer
 -- in the com -- he worked 
for the Bureau of Standards 
and he wo rked on th e computers.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is the continuation of a Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Dora Klayman.
 This is tape number two, 
side A. We -- you are in 
Washington, you have a cousin of your hu -- 
A: Husb and. 
Q: -- husband™s cousin here. 
A: Mm. 

Q: And you said you stopped writing to  a lo
t of your friends. Bu t wh at about your 
uncle? 
A: Well, I wrote to my  uncle not as fre
quently as I should have probably, looking 
back. Bu t I did. I sent pictures. And waite
d for, basically, for my -- I made promises 

-- when I wrote to him, I -- originally to 
say I would get -- I wanted to get married, I 
promised that I would go back to school 
and finish. And it waited until Elliot was in 
kindergarten , but once he was in kinderg arten, I enrolled in Montgomery College, 

which was very, very close. I -- I finally 
learned how to drive.
 I was 27, I learned 
how to drive. And -- and I started taking -- 
I took -- I fre -- one course. And while he 
was in kindergarten, I would drive to Ta
koma Park and take my  class and drive 
back, and be back for him 
to come back from school. An
d I took a class in English 
with a Dr. Laverne Miller, who shall not be
 forgotten by me forever. She just died 
recently. She was a fantastic teacher, the best
 I ever had, or one of the best I ever 

had, anyway. The best I had in the States
, I think. And I took my first English 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
37
course, and you know, freshman English 10
1, and wrote my  fi
rst essay and drove 
Dan crazy because I wanted hi
m to read it and he wouldn™t. And he said, just do it, 
just do it, just go. It™s okay, you can do it. 
So I went with my first piece, and I have 
it, and the class ended and she se -- the cl
ass -- the new class began and we had to 
have that [indecipherable] when a new class 
began, she said that there was one good 
composition. And she started 
reading it, it was mine. I w as like, oh my God, you 
know? 

Q: What did you write about? 
A: Oh, it was just something we had to su
mmarize, it was nothing mu ch. It was just 
a summary of -- of -- of some article about so
me planets or something. It wasn™t -- it 
was just ri - - she sent us home to write a summary. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And obviously I knew how to  write. I™v
e said that many times, you know, people 
ask me, how do these ESL kids do it? And I 
say well, if they can write to begin with, 
they do fine. But it™s not a matter of 
teaching just the language, it™s teaching 
everything. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And -- and I wou -- I had always been a ve
ry good writer, so I 
just transferred the 
skill, it was no big deal. I had 
to learn English, but I didn™t have to learn how to 
write. 

Q: Right. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
38
A: So -- so that was -- that was fine. So 
eventually I took a lot 
of cla sses f rom Dr. 
Miller, she taught [indecipherable] books at
 -- at Takoma Park. And she even tually 
hired me to, when I finished 
col -- when I finish
ed University of Maryland she hired 
me, and then my -- that was my first job,
 was teaching at -- at Montgomery Co llege. 

Q: Huh. Huh. 
A: So, anyway, I had [indecipherable] 
Q: So when you went back to school, did 
you know that you want
ed to teach English 
as a second language? 
A: No, I had no idea, in fact
, that that™s what I would be
 doing. And -- and in fact, I -
- I thought exactly what -- th
at I would not be doing that
, because I felt like English 
as a second language was not a field th
at anybody even  heard about here -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- at that time. [phone ringing] And now
 ignore it. [indecipherable] it™s unknown, 
anyhow. 
Q: Just let me -- let me pause it. [tape brea
k] -- it wasn™t a field 
that was known here. 
A: No, it was not -- no one even talked a
bout that. Certainly wa
sn™t taught in the 
county. English as a seco
nd language was not a reco
gnized class offering in 
Montgomery county. And I thought, even if th
e -- had ex -- if it had even started, I 
would have thought that they wo uldn™t wa
nt someone who had an accent and was 
from a different country. And so I went to
 my second experien
ce, namely to my 
Swiss experience, and -- because
 I had become ru -- quite fl
uent that year in -- in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
39
French. And so I thought I would be a Fr
ench  major. Languages was what I always 
wanted to study, so that was fine. So 
I was going to, you know
, do French. Which I 
did do, I enrolled in French, but I had such  
-- just crazy experiences, because in -- in 
European schools you don™t start from -- 
from ground zero at the university. You 
can™t sort of decide you™re going to be a French major and start 
with French 101 in 
college. Wh ich you could here. I mean, it 
will take you some doing -- take some -- 
some doing, but you can if you want to. Ther
e it™s im -- it™s -- it was great -- greatly 
pro -- it was problematic in every way becaus
e when I came to Zagreb and I decided 
-- I-I was an English major, but I decided al
ready to study so me French because I 
knew I was going to  go to Sw itzerland, I ha
d planned on that. So I too -- I had to 
take French with the same student -- with 
the same kids who had studied  French for 
five years in -- in high school. 
Q: Mm. 
A: I had studied English. And I had some pr
 -- private lessons, but I struggled  greatly 
that year, trying to do Fr
ench with people who were ahead of me. And the same 
thing happened agai
n when I came to Switzerland. I 
was still struggling with French 
and they  again put me too far ahead. 
I could never -- you -- you can™t make a 
decision wh at you want to take. It™s like 
what™s available and where they think you 
should be, with -- without re
gard  and -- wh ere you actually are as a student. So  I 
thought, oh God, I™m going to do th is agai
n? And wh en I realized that you can start 
from the beginning here, I enrolled in 101, Fr
ench 101. Well, they
 threw me out of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
40
there and I went to a higher level class, 
but I was at MC and I also started taking 
Spanish, which was the smarte
st thing I ever did. Bu t an
yway , I eventually graduated 
from University of Maryland with a degree 
in French and a minor
 in -- in Spanish. 
And then , at that point, ESL became already 
-- started to become a field a-and I had -
- because I dragged th rough schools for su
ch a long period of tim
e, I didn™t golike 
three or four years, I don™t know how long
 it took me, a long time. And I had -- I 
started teaching ESL at Takoma Park in th
e evening program, before I had any kind 
of a degree. Because I -- while I was a student
 there, they recogn
ized that I could -- 
that I knew something about 
what -- what -- what needed
 to be taught and that I 
understood the process. And they  star
ted the evening programs for the new 
Vietnamese commun
ity coming in. 
Q: At Montgomery College, yeah. 
A: At Montgomery Colle
ge. Actually no, that™s not ev en true. I-I started when the 
Cubans were coming in. 
Q: In the early 80™s? 
A: In the early -- oh, it was 
la -- much earlier than that. 
Q: Oh, oh, the first wave. 
A: That first wave -- 

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- of Cubans -- 
Q: Wow. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
41
A: -- that came in. 
Q: In the 60™s. 
A: Yes, and we had -- nobody knew how 
to teach it, nobody 
knew what to do and 
nobody knew n-no -- we didn™t have any 
books. The only books we had were 
something th at the army had used. It was 
-- it was -- it was an -- you know, an -- an 
old system. I [indecipherable] remember
 what it was called, English 800 or 
something, and it was like based on 800 
vocabulary items and -- and there were 
these sent-sentences we were
 supposed  to be teaching, it was like these Cuban ladies 
that y -- that didn™t know wh
at hit them, and we are teaching them, if it had been 
raining in  Miami, I would have taken my
 umbrella. W h at? You know? Because we 
just had no idea. Nobody kn
ew how to teach it. And we
 were just sort of like 
struggling and figuring things out. And -- 
and teaching in -- in the basement across 
the street from MC there was an old c
hurch  and in  that basement there was a 
classroom we could use. And then  the Vi
etnamese population came in, and then 
some books were published, and we tried -- 
you know, there were 
three of us trying 
to figure out what was going on. I was 
coordinating th e program; I hadn™t even  
graduated from college, you know? It was crazy. 

Q: I bet it was fulfilling. 

A: It was very fulfilling and -- and it worked
 very well for me in every way because 
my  husband could stay home with the kids
 and we taught -- and I taught twice a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
42
week in the evening, and th
ey paid me. Wasn™t much, bu
t it was great. And so I was 
-- I was doing th at and -- and going 
to school at the same time. 
Q: Mm. 
A: But, to back up, you as
ked me about my  uncle. When the kids -- so that was one 
thing I did, I -- I did -- I go back to  school
, not just because he wanted me to, but I 
did, too.  

Q: You wanted to, sure. 

A: And that was one thing. Bu t the other 
thing was that in -- by 19 -- let me see, 
Wanda was five, so she was in kindergarte
n when I got my c
itizenship. That was 
another story. And -- and since she was in
 kinderg arten we coul
d take her out of 
school, we felt, for a little bit of time. E
lliot was still in nursery 
school, and we went 
to -- we went to Switzerland for a bit and to
 cro -- to Yugoslavia to visit my  uncle. 
And we stayed for a few months. 

Q: A few months? 

A: That was -- that was great, yeah. 
Q: I bet he was so thrilled. 
A: He was thrilled, yes, he was thrilled.
 There I am, you know, arriving back with 

two kids. And th en ev entually Dan came, and 
at that point, of course, we were doing 
-- 
Q: That was the first time he met Dan. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
43
A: Yes. They got along very  well. They
 spoke in -- Dan [indecipherable] German, 
but you know, he went
 up and he was -- Dan was very 
outgoing and lots of fun and 
they had a good time togeth
er. It was very nice, it was v ery fulfilling and really 
great. Oh, we -- at that time we were doing 
better financially so we could, you know, 
we -- first o f all we -- we have saved en
ough money fo r all of us to go to  Europe. 
And second, we could rent a car and you 
know, just go around a little bit and see a 
bit, and that was -- that was really  a lovely trip. And so -- 

Q: Great, yeah. Let me  ask you about the 60™
s in this country. A lo t of people have 
commented that coming to this country as
 they did, and as you did, they felt 
extremely sensitive to the civil rights m
ovement, especially people who moved 
anywhere close to the south and saw how bl
acks were being treated in this country. 
Was that -- was that of -- a -- a significant ki
nd of thing on your 
radar at that time 
here in Washington? 
A: Yeah, it was. 

Q: Washington had quite a -- 
A: It was very much so. 
Q: -- quite its share of conflicts here. 

A: In fact, yeah, very much
 so. And in fact, I was just
 saying to the very friend 
whose phone just rang, how I remember so 
well all the Civil Rights marches. I was 
at a march yesterday, the -- 

Q: Wo men™s mar ch . 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
44
A: -- the Women™s ma rch and how huge it 
was, but -- but it was not fraught with 
danger, and those marches were fraught with
 danger. And I didn't g o  very much, I 
stayed with the kids, but -- but my husb and went. I -- he was -- he was an avid 
photographer, and -- and also wanted to re
cord everything and he -- he -- he would 
go down . Bu t I went down  too.
 I remember serving food in
 tent city in those days, 
with the kids. And we -- you know, we liv
ed through the -- through the riots and 
Martin Luther King™s death and I rememb
er -- and of course, through President 

Kennedy™s death. I -- I know that I was ve
ry American already, because I remember 
that I cried when Presiden
t Kennedy was nominated beca
use I wanted Stevenson to  
be nominated. 

Q: You had already had strong f
eelings about American politics. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: That was pretty quick. 
A: Yeah. Well, of course you know, I ha
d -- I had a tutor living with me. And I 
didn™t have that other community. That, I th
ink is really major in my transformation, 
that -- that I got very in
volved -- oh yeah, I was - 
I was doing th e dollars for 
demo crats. I have pictures of my self 
co -- you know, trying to get money fo r 
Johnson to be elected. I mean
, you know, it™s -- so it™s -- I-I got really involved in -- 
in -- in the community and in -- and in  
life here. With, you know, with Civil Rights 
and everything else that came -- th at came do
wn th e pike with the demo cratic party. 
I -- I served as a judge of elections in -- at 
-- one year. And so I just got a -- to meet a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
45
lot of people that were sort of kindred sp
irits. And of course in this com -- this 
particular community where 
we lived, we -- it was an al
l white community at the 
time. And from what I heard, 
even though this was built 
by -- by a -- a fellow Jew, it 
had originally, when it was bu
ilt in the late 1930™s, early 40™s -- well, not by 40™s, it 
was a-all gone. But -- but the early -- the ho
uses built in the 30™s actually had a-an 
anti-Jewish covenant. [indecipherable] 
Q: In this neighborhood? 

A: Yes, in this neighborhood. 
Q: What is this neighborhood called? 
A: This neighborhood is 
called Rock Creek Forest. 

Q: Hm. 

A: And I think it went off fast, and I neve
r saw any origin al documents. But my next 
door neig hbor in  my  old house wa -- told 
me about it, and -- and they were sa -- 
savvy. He was a newspaper [indecipherable]
 Levins, and he was a -- they were pe -- 
really involved in labor issues and he 
was -- he published the newspaper for the 
railway union. And so I -- I le
arned from them a lot, as well.
 So I -- so, at -- in  this 
neighborhood at th -- at that time, I didn™t
 even -- I wasn™t awar
e that everybody was 
white in the neighborhood un
til a black family moved in 
and nobody said anything, 
everything was fine. But then th ey tried to
 buy a house -- th -- I think they were 
renting an d then they  tried to buy a hous
e and -- and she came to tell us, I remember, 
that th -- th -- they had, I don™t know, so
mething had happened  in their house. I can™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
46
reme mb er now wh ether somebody threw st
ones or whatever, 
what happen, or 
someone wrote graffiti. And the neighborhood, 
there were a lot of -- they were rather 
really progressive people living here and 
-- and people rallied around them. But then 
we became aware that -- that it™s b een diffi
cult for -- for black pe
ople to buy houses 
here. And eventually things calmed down
 and -- and th-they bought some houses. 
It™s not that mixed here now, but 
it -- it is, I mean, you know, I have -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- neighbors across the street, o r down the street -- 
Q: At that time, did your friends know a
bout your history and was it something that 
you either -- either consciously made a poi
nt of telling people or consciously  didn™t 
make a point of telling people? Or was it just  relevant or irrelevant to your daily life 
or in your relations with friends? 
A: I would tell people if they asked. I -- 
it wasn™t something that I would -- I -- I 
certainly, you know didn™t think, oh, I™ve got
 to go and tell people, or advocate for -- 
for knowledge of the Holo caust
 or I -- I -- I would be aware -- more aware of these 
issues when I would meet 
somebody from Croatia, that
™s one thing. I think I 
purposely did not seek out people from Yu
goslavia because there was always an 
issue of, and wh ere were you du
ring th e war and who are you? 
Q: What side were you on? 

A: What side were you on an
d wh at side are you on now? 
Q: Because things were getting more 
and more tense over there, yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
47
A: Well, I o -- I was aware of the fact that 
a lot of people had es
caped to this country 
and a lot of people left in 1945, and I just
 felt like I™m just as well av oiding it. Now, 
i-if there was somebody from Serbia, I woul
d feel much more co mfortable than if 
there was somebody from Croatia. 
Q: Explain why. 
A: Well, that™s because during -- during the 
war, Croatia and Serbia were not in the 
same country. Yugoslavia fell apart afte
r the invasion, and Croatia became an 
independent -- so-called ing -- it was called
 independent state of Croatia, Nezavisan 
Stanje od Hrvatski
. 
And it was a puppet government that
 carried out the edicts of -- 
of the Third Reich. And so  everything, in
cluding genocide perpetrated on Jews was 
also perpetrated on Serbs.
 
Q: Serbs. 
A: And so that I had -- I -- I -- I knew that 
if I met a Serb, that 
Serb could not have 
been my enemy during the war, because they
 were enemies of my b -- they were 
enemies of Germany or -- and of the Usta
si, who were the Croatian Nazis, as a -- 

Croatian fascists, I should say -- 

Q: Who were your enemies. 
A: Who -- who were my enemies. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
48
Q: Right. 
A: So -- but it was also interesting to meet
 some Serbs. I became -- you know, I had 
a very dist -- in some sense I had a revise
d sense of history. I still don™t un -- I still 
don™t know the truth -- not that anybody rea
lly does, but I find that talking to my 
friend Lucy, I find out a lot of things thatI wasn™t aware of. And it™s interesting to 

work with Lucy, who is 
from s -- from -- from Croatia 
and who is in her 80™s. 
Q: We should say this is Lucie Rosenberg. 
A: Lucie Rosenberg. And to Sanya Primor
az, who work s at the Holocaust Mu seum 
and who is in her 30™s, and who™s also fro
m Croatia, and she™s Catholic, but married 
to a Jew, and me. And th e three of us ar
e basically three generations from Croatia. 
And each one of us has a different viewpo
int. Now, I do -- shouldn™t say different 
viewpoint. A different -- 
Q: Experien ce. 
A: -- experience. And different educati
onal background in terms of what had 
happened . Lucy , who le
ft just before the war, and 
could view history from -- as it 
developed during th e war, from here. Sa
nya, who wasn™t born and I, who lived 
through that, but I was educated in communi
st Yugoslavia. I am a true product of 
Tito™s schools. I know history of Yugoslavia
 as they wanted us 
to know it. I know -- 
and I™ve now forgotten a lot, but -- but I 
ne -- I-I -- I -- I™m a product of -- of the 
educational system of -- of -- of the communist era. 
Q: And could you, as a little si
debar, sort of describe -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
49
A: What that meant? 
Q: -- what the factors of -- yeah, 
wha-what that means to you now. 
A: Well, what that means to me now is that
 I really -- I really -- they -- we talked 
about Chetniks, for example. Chetniks we
re the Serbs who w -- fought against the 
Germans, apparently, but they also foug
ht against the partisans. So in post-
Communist Yugoslavia, they were the enemy.
 They were just as
 much the enemy as 
-- as the Germans. But na -- I didn™t un
derstand ex actly why England, fo r example 
and United States were sup
porting Chetniks at the beginning of the war. Now I 
understand. First of all they didn™t know 
who was who. Second, th-there were some 
circumstan ces where the Chetniks were doing
 some good things. On  the other hand, 
of course, the sa -- they were nationalists at 
the same time so they also have their bad 
points. But when  I would meet Serbs afte
r, when I came here, who would tell me 

that -- that their families were Chetniks, 
I would think, my God, what horror. A-And 
-- and there probably  was, but I still don™
t quite know. I still don™t understand the 
Chetnik movement properly because I™ve never 
really delved into 
it. But I know that 
it is not exactly as black and white as I had learned it. So th-th-this whole business, 

and of course now, after the 
™92 war there, issues are changed th e -- you know, that -
- 

Q: Yeah.

A: -- that [indecipherable] se
ntiments changed again, be
cause in fact, who was doing 
-- who -- who was, in fact, committing ch
eno -- genocid e on the Bosn ians? It was 
again the Chetniks. So, whic
h Chetniks, you know? Wh i -- 
Q: Yeah. Bu t going back to the 50™s, just 
as the Ch etniks history was taught to you 
in a very black and white manner, I™m al
so guessing that the partisan history was 
taught to you in  a gray  -- 

A: Also as a -- exactly. 

Q: -- in a -- in a -- 
A: Everything was perfect. 
Q: -- in a very glorified manner. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah -- 
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: -- and that Tito was --  

A: God. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Exactly. And you know, I -- I -- I was -- 
I mean I -- I have to -- I -- you know, I-
I™m liberal now, which is sort
 of to the left of -- certain
ly President Bush . But -- but 
at that time, you know, that was starti
ng school, and I would come home and have 
these heated discussions with
 my  uncle about, you know,
 imperialist Americans and 
imperialist this and that. I grew out of th
at one eventually , but I wanted to go and, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
51
you know, be with a brigade and -- 
and build a -- build the O-Otestrad 
[indecipherable] and -- 
Q: Fight for brotherh ood and unity. 

A: Yeah, fight fo r brotherhood and unity a
nd -- and you know, it™s not that he was to 
the right. He -- you know, and he
 was considered a -- because he had also been in the 
concen tration camp. He was in the same  
concentration camp where my family was 
killed. And after the war, you know, he was c
onsid ered also a hero and you know, he 
was director of the bank and so on, uno
fficial mayor of the town. I mean, he was 
highly respected and regard
ed by that government. But he also had a reasonable 
[phone ringing] middle of the little point of
 view. [tape break] Saying that oh, you 
know, oh I™ll tell you mo re about my  uncle 
and one of the -- wa -- one of the fa -- 
yeah, we were talking about my
 uncle and being -- not being 
really far to the left -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but certainly not being right eithe
r. And I remember we 
had knockdown  drag 
out fights about when
 -- when [indecipherable] of 
the Suez Canal. And th e Su ez 
Canal was handed over to E
gypt, I was all fo r it and I -- you know, we -- because we 
were all herded out to go and -- and scream
 anti -- anti-Imperialis
t slogans, and they 
were saying well, you know, 
England invested so mu ch m
oney in the building of the 
canal, was like, so what? You know, so -- 
so you had that, you kn
ow, and of course 
Tito and you know, we -- we sang songs 
as children, you know? Tito was our 

[indecipherable] and blue violet and on the 
-- so -- and of course we were all -- had 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
52
to be pio -- Pioneers. And I had to, you 
know, march around with my red bandana 
around my  neck. And you had to
 be part of th e commu nist
 youth. Is that thing on? 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And the -- it -- it -- it became a problem 
for me when I was trying to get my -- my 

U.S. citizenship. 
Q: Citizenship. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Oh. 
A: Not th at I was in any way, any kind of
 a leader, ever. I -- and you never asked to 
be a Pioneer or to be the communist youth,
 you just were. If you were in school, you 
were comm unist youth, that™s how it was. 
And you didn™t volunteer to go out and -- 
and march for, you know, Tr
ieste  should be Yugoslav
, you just had to go. 
Q: You had to. 

A: You were gathered from the school 
and you were marched out. But when I 
applied for my citizenship, 
there was -- I was in -- really interrogated. And I 
remember very well this lady asking me 
why I didn't quit. Why I didn™t announce 
that I am q u itting this organization. And I th
ought to myself, lady, I really wanted to 
survive. I -- you know, I really didn™t --didn™
t want to be forbidden to go to school, 
and ended up in  -- and end up in  jail, I just
 -- I wasn™t that ki
nd of an activist.  
Q: Because a lot of that was going on in the 50™s. 
A: Abso lutely. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
53
Q: Yeah. 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: A lot of that was going 
on. One of my  friend™s father
 ended up in jail, and we 
never understood ex actly why. He was -- one
 day he was some sort of an off -- 
official and the next day he was nowh ere 
to be seen. So a lot of that was going on 
and you had to be careful. 
And -- and I saw -- I saw many
 abuses that -- you know, 
as stupidities of the system. People wh
o had no business runn
ing anything, you 
know. One minute they were shepherd s and 
the next minute they  were running the 

city, or being th e police chiefs, or demandi
ng that li -- that [indecipherable] we had a 
house and they demanded that
 we relinquish the house becau
se we didn™t have -- that 
was not the house we lived in, but we
 had another building th at was under 
construction, starting from before the war. And 
then we were ordere
d to finish it, and 
of course we didn™t have the mo ney to finish
 it. And so we said well, we can™t. They 
said well, then the govern
ment will finish it and -- an
y way they wanted to. And 
there™s three people who probab ly didn™t 
have a public -- didn™t have an indoor 
plumbing of -- ever in their lives, now deci
ded to make it into 
three apartments from 
two apartments and they made a total mess 
of it. You know, there was that kind of 
stuff going on. Those kinds o
f, you know, where everything was topsy-turvy. Bu t, 
you know, you -- and -- and I wa
s aware that you had to be
 quiet and not say certain 
things in certain places, and -- and you know,
 we listened to Voice of America and -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
54
and BBC ev ery day. So we did know what wa
s going on. But you still had that sense 
of being -- you had that sens
e of being in -- in sort of -- some sort of jail. 
Q: You did? 
A: Yeah. Well, it took me -- for example, wh
en I decided to -- when I decided to go 
first time to Switzerland, my  aunt and my
 uncle finally, you know, wrote to me and -
- and I decided to go. It took me a long time 
to get a visa. And of course it took some 
doing fo r me to have en ough money to buy a ticket, even though my uncle was 

director of [indecipherable]. We only lived  
the way we lived because we have th ings 
from before the war we could sell. So, you
 know, there goes another gold ch ain that 
was sold and I got a ticket. But the visa -- 
I got only th e passport,
 and visa I got only 
because I was considered a victim of 
fascism. That was the actual title -- 
Q: Hm. 
A: -- that we were given, žrtva faıizam
. 
And -- and --
 
Q: That was a Swiss c ateg -- 
A: No, th at was Yugoslav. 
Q: Huh. 

A: Yugoslav, because you couldn™t get a pa
ssport to leave. You couldn™t leave the 
country. You know, none of the comm
unist countries allowed people to -- 

Q: Right. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
55
A: -- go out. So I was allowed -- I was gi
ven a passport because I wrote -- I wrote 
this letter that I wanted to go
 and how we had, you know --  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: Okay . 
A: Anyway, so I had to write that I had 
this one uncle in Switzerland and that I 
wanted to  go and visit, he invited me. A
nd so they gave me a passport. But when I 
came back, I was a celebr
ity, because nobody had b
een out of the country. 
Q: Hm. 
A: And I went through my hi -- my 
-- my classroom -- my -- my high school 
classrooms and I talked about things that 
I™d seen. And, you know, strange things 
were -- were -- I-I-I mean, the things that 
I talked about. I re
member talking about 
doors that o -- that opened automatically wh
en you go to a supermarket, which we 
didn™t have either, and how -- you know,how many things are on the shelves and so 

on. Cause after the -- that was ™54, I think 
ow -- whe -- but things were still really 
tough. You know, I don™t know 
about that time, but just previous to that, I mean, we 
had to have coupons for everything. And ge
tting a pair of shoes was a major thing. I 
reme mb er buying my  first pair of shoes 
that I could actually
 go out and buy from a 
store. And you know, that wa
s so beautiful, I put them on my  night table, I mean. 
And they were as ugly as can be, when 
I think back . I know 
exactly what they 
looked like.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
56
Q: Hm. 
A: And, you know, things were -- you know,
 there was very little to be had and even 
books, and -- you know, I n -- I rememb er
 how difficult it was 
to buy notebooks. 
And I got a first -- ma -- my -- my  uncle se
nt me my fir -- my notebook -- notebooks 
and era -- an eraser, and ballpoint pen 
from Sw itzerland, that was like gold, you 
know? I went around showing it off to 
everybody and everyb
ody was borrowing 
mine -- my  eraser, because it didn™t smudge 
everything. So, things were -- things 

were tough after the war, economically. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And of course it was, you know, th
e communist [indecipherable] was it was 
because of the war and becau
se, you know, Imperialists 
were against us and we -- 
after nine -- after ™48, after Yugoslavia 
broke off from Russia, 
it was, you know, we 
were independent and we were maverick a
nd in forefront -- in 
the forefront of -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the world, you know. 
Q: It was the non-aligned movement. 
A: Non-aligned movement. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was the beginning of the -- it was 
the non-aligned moveme
nt and you know, it 
was India and Egypt were our friends, and 
so on. So it was -- so
 I have that, you 
know. I grew up with th at, I -- I got ov
er that, I understand th at. I don™t und -- still 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
57
understand some of the intricacies of -- of 
what really kept things going and I don™t -
- historically I have not yet read enough, 
I™m pro -- I don™t know whether I ever will, 
I keep buying histories of Y
ugoslavia to read everything,
 to -- to really figure out 
what was going on. I read qu
ite a bit lately, since I™ve be
en involved in the project 
with the Holocaust Museum, 
because I need to know -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- what was happening. 

Q: Let™s jump ahead 
a little bit to the 70™s, if you don™t mind. 
A: Mm-hm. Not at all. 

Q: There was a time in this country  wh en
 a lot of people became aware and spoke 
out publicly about the Holo
caust for the first time. It
 was somehow not on the 
national radar much before then. And ene 
-- even people who were doing academic 
research into, you know, historical questi
ons about the Ho locaust were not always 
publicly received, acknowled
ged as doing important work
. But suddenly in the late 
70™s there were -- a number of things happ
ened. One was the telev ision series that 
aired. 
A: ﬁThe Holocaust,ﬂ 
that -- that program? 
Q: Yeah, and another was the Holocaust Rememb rance Day -- 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- became sort of a genera -- a new gene
ration of young people
 took that up. Do 
you remember those days and -- 
and -- and how did you respond? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
58
A: I remember -- I remember the days, but 
I don™t remember -- I 
-- I remember when 
that series was -- was filmed
 and I reme mb er that a lot of people started asking me 
questions, that -- you know, how was it and 
what happened and 
what I remembered. 
That hadn™t popped up before
. So I remember -- people al
so were -- you know, I was 
-- people asked me about, you know, did I 
live like Anne Frank. And so I usually -- 
and ev en now I -- I tend to  say to people
 when they ask me, where were -- you 
know, what were you doing during the war, 
I would say, well, I 
was hidden,but not 
like Anne Frank. Because I was really not 
-- I mean, I w a -- I may have been hidden 
for a day, not for years, in the -- in th
at same  sense. I don™t know -- I was so 
involved  in school at that time. I finally -- I -- I-I -- I was -- I just got out of co llege 
and I was student teaching and -- and I got my
 first job and I was -- I was teaching at 
Bethesda Chevy Chase High School. 
Q: Oh. 
A: And that was -- well, after the year 
-- after the year at 
Montgomery College, 
where I was teaching full time in the regular
 students, rather than that evening 
program that I was doing, I was really busy. 
My kids were in j
unior high and -- or 
high school. No, they were 
in -- I think they were -- ye
ah, Elliot was still in middle 
school, Wanda was in high school, and 
I was student teaching and coming home 
tired, wondering whether this 
is what I wanted to do, 
screaming at everybody at 
home. I was like, I already had it with the 
kids. It was har -- I 
was student teaching 
half French and half ESL and I starte
d to become aware of this whole new 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
59
immigrant community, and ge
tting involved in all thes
e other kids and their 
problems, all these kids coming from Vi
etnam and -- and I think I was mo re 
involved in that than I 
was in the issues of the 
Holocaust, somehow. I started 
teaching at -- was it at -- an-and then my hu
sband had his first heart attack. And that 
also loomed fairly large. 1970 fo  -- 1974,
 something like that, was his first heart 
attack. And Elliot was just Bar Mitzvah and 
so, you know, the -- I -- I-I was aware of 
it peripherally, but not involved
 in it in any way and it just seemed to me -- and I 
don™t think I was that aware that it was not 
being talked  about. That™s another thing, 
you know, because what -- when
 I was in Switzerland with my aunt and uncle, it was 
so overwhelming. My aunt ta
lks about it incessan
tly. But I don™t th -- and I don™t -- 
didn™t know any survivors here, really. So 
I just thought well, yo
u know, if I thought 
anything I would have thought well, why 
would Americans -- I think I -- I underst -- 
I think -- I know what -- I remember that
, you know, there were many mo -- there 
were movies, like war-time movies, American war-time 
movies. Liberation movies. 
And I think it was more in my -- my mind,
 m-mo re work toward , you know, being 
liberated and wh at that felt like. The -- you 
know, being helped by the United States, 
I remembered UNRRA packages
, things of that nature more, and I was just so 
involved in like present day 
issues, as I si -- mentioned,
 the politics of -- of the day 
that I -- I don™t think th at was very mu ch on my  mind.  

Q: Interesting th ough, that you had -- that 
experience was, very clearly what moved 
you in th e direction that you went in
, to help other people who were -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
60
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- adjusting to life here just as you 
had. So , in a way you™d mo ved way -- you™d 
taken that experience with you and moved way into -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- another direction. 
A: Yeah, exactly. 
Q: In some way left it 
way far behind, and -- 
A: I le -- in  some way --  
Q: -- and taken it and moved ah ead. 
A: -- it was with me. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Because I could always -- I al -- you 
know, I would tell the kids what my 
experience had been and I would unders
tand the kids who came from war-time 
experiences, and I wo uld talk with them
 about it, and I would say, you know, 
eventually you know, you have
 to think in a positive way 
and things are going to be 
better and -- cause we had -- at -- at BCC we
 had a whole group of
 kids, at one point 
early, who actually -- Vietnamese orphans, or 
perhaps they were or
phans, they didn™t 
even know. Kids that were boat people,
 boat kids, who [p hone ringing, tape 
interruption] 

Q: Kid -- you said there were kids who had been boat people. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
61
A: Kids who had been  boat people. Ther
e was -- BCC is right next to a Lourdes 
Catholic church and Lourde
s had housed an d taken care
 of some dozen kids who 
lived there. 
Q: Hm. 

A: And I -- they were all in -- in my pr
ogram and I was -- at that time we still 
weren™t a department. Eventually I was h
ead of the ESL department, but wh en I 

came to BCC in ™77 -- ™76 - ™77 school year, 
I was al -- I was alone. I -- I had all the 
ESL kids, I was their mothe
r. And, you know, I mothered
 those kids til the day I 
retired, and I still do, to some extent, but
 it was just -- it was an overwhelming job 
sometimes. And some -- those kids who 
were -- who were at Lourdes had huge 
amounts of problems and -- and you know, y-
you had to constantly
 be looking after 
them. And there were Camb odian kids too, a
nd th ey were suicidal and th ey had, you 
know, just -- 
Q: They™d been through so me terrible ordeals. 

A: -- their -- their -- they -- they™d gone 
through so me terrible times. Kao and Sao, 
the two Cambodian  kids, one of them did 
commit suicide later on. So, it was -- you 
know, I was just really too i
nvolved with that. I mean, w h at
 -- think about it, I started 
teaching it -- teaching there in ™76 - ™77 scho
ol year. Elliot had just come there, he 
was in 10
th
 grade and Wanda was in 12
th
 grade. I was in -- I was 38 - 39. I-It was all 
I could do. 

Q: Yeah, keep moving. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
62
A: The Holocaust was very far behind me. 
Q: Right. 
A: That Holocaust. That was like -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- I was with -- with 
these kids Holo caust. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Listening about Cambodia and Vietnam. 

Q: Yeah. Ho w did your kids respond to  
-- numb er one, they knew your story, but 
your wo rking with these other kids? 

A: I don™t know, they just sort of accepte
d it. They were just used to -- our house 
was very open and -- and you 
know, I had kids come to th
e house. We had parties in 
our house, I have -- we had -- I had bi
g di -- Thanksgiving dinners for them. I 
cooked a dinner -- they still do it at BCC, it™
s continued. Th-The -- the tradition had 
continued. I had Thanksgiving, a whole Th
anksgiving tu rkey , wh ich we served  like 
the week before Thanksgiving and we had 
a dinner at my house
 for everybody in 
ESL. Eventu ally it got too big. We had a fe
w since I moved into th is house, when  -- 
fortunately was larger house, so we could 
do it. But then -- then
 we started doing it 
at school. So  the kids were just sort of 
like part of it, and -- but sometimes not as 
involved as I would have wa
nted them to be actually, b ecause they were just -- y ou 
know they were just American kids, who wa
nted to be with other American kids and 
I™m -- I™ve always had troubl
e getting American kids to 
participate w ith -- with 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
63
foreign kids. They -- I -- I -- you know, as op
en as I -- I always say when  they  say, 
oh Americans don™t like us, or this and 
that. And I say no, 
no, no, you know, 
Americans are very open and they™re very acc
epting, and I think generally they are. 
But there always is sort of a divide, ne
vertheless and you know, I felt like I was 
always sort of there to be between them a
nd -- and that other world. And funny that I 
never felt-- I know th at there are people 
who feel -- and there are many foreign ESL 
teachers now, I mean foreign born ESL teac
hers now, and very often they will feel 
with the kids against that outside. But I ne
ver did. I just always felt that I was the 
American. And you know, people ca -- ki
ds ask me, you know, where I™m from and 
I said, well, I™m from h ere, but I wasn™t bor
n here. I™ll tell them right away. But -- 
and -- and I often tell them when  they ask 
me about it, I say well, that™s why I can 

understand you better, because 
I had this -- I went through the same experience. Of 
course, I was very lucky in  that I had someon
e to take care of me and guide me and -
- and I knew  the language and -- and I wa
s educated and makes a big difference. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Makes a huge difference. But even the 
way I grew up, I grew up, you know, in a 
small town with sort of a 
-- it -- it™s very funny becau
se Yugoslavia is -- I mean, 
Croatia now, but Yugoslavia certainly, it™s -- 
it™s a -- really a class society. It™s a -- a 
-- United States is too, but we -- we clai
m we aren™t. And to 
some extent, even 
though we are, I -- I think 
there is an easier way of -- th-the -- the division, the 
vertical division isn™t nearly as strong as 
it is there. And I g -- I grew up -- I know 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
64
that sounds funny because of what had ha
ppened to me, but I 
grew up privileged in 
many ways, you know, because I was sort of [speaks foreign language here] which 
means sort of like a -- from a noble fami ly
, you know. Bu t that™s because of my  
uncle, not so mu ch -- and -- and I was always
 taught th at -- that you had to ha -- to 
help and -- and be -- I know 
that sounds awfully patrician,
 but was like, you know, to 
not lord  it over kids who have less, and to
 give. And -- and be 
helpful, and it just 
kind of stayed with me. So that -- so it co
mes to me naturally to -- to -- to do -- you 
know, to work, to -- to
 work with these all 
-- kids. I had all --both of those things, 
you know. To having come from di -- from --
 from that backgroun
d and then -- then 
come from -- then come to th
is country . So  it™s a -- it™s sort of a double whammy . It 
was sort of I s -- I often instinctivel
y understood, or I think I understood. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: The kids [indecipherable] I don™t know. 
Q: And -- and when  did you start your wo rk
 volunteering at the mu seum? It™s recent 
-- 
A: Oh, that happen
ed fairly recently. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Because in ‚99 I retired from Montgo
mery county public schools. Not that I 
couldn™t have gone on, but a lot of my  fri
ends were retiring and I was getting a bit 
tired of being there morning, noon an
d night, from seven in the morning til who 
knows what hour and then doing work  in 
the evening. And th e school was closing 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
65
for two years and moving to  another ve
nue, and while --while BCC was being 
rebuilt. And I thought well, that™s sort of -- 
I -- and I just -- I -- I had just turned 60 
and I thought, well, it™ s an opportune moment
 for me to close down, so I don™t have 
to pack and repack and unpack
 and okay, so this is it. So I had just retired, and -- 
when -- and I -- of course I knew Lucie 
Rosenberg for awhile
. Actually, an ESL 
person who is a mu tual friend introduced 
us, and -- some years ago, and she had 
started telling me about that -- about this 
material arriving from Jasenovac, and from 
Croatia and that she had started working on
 it. And then I asked her about it again 
and ag ain. And I had started 
working immediately back fo
r the county, but on a part 
time basis as a -- as a -- a consultant. So 
I was work ing basically two days a week 
and I had mo re time and I said
 well, you know, let me take a look at it and she said 
she never -- she hadn™t wanted to ask me 
to come, but she was thrilled that I would 
want to go. But she hadn™t 
wanted  to ask me because she thought it would be too 
close to home for me, emotionally. And -- bu
t I said yeah, I™m pretty tough, I™ll look 
at it. So I went one time with her and Sanya.
 They were working on 
this material that 
had arrived from Jasenovac and that was in 
Linthicum, ready to be -- well, they had 
already been working on it, was in -- totally 
in process -- in prog
ress. But they were 
doing everything 
from classifying material, a writte
n material to packing forks and 
knives and spoons that had been fo und in 
camp . Not knives, forks and spoons that 
have been unearthed  from the camp, in
to envelopes and marking th em to -- you 
know, writing translations of letters and th
ere was one cookbook and things of that

nature. And I said fine, I™ll do it with yo
u once a week, so we went there once a 
week and started working on it, 
and that™s how I started doing it. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I™ve been there ever since.  

Q: Hm. Well, that™s a long time. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Five years now. 

A: I don™t know, is it five years already? No, I don™t know. 
Q: You said ™99. 
A: ™99 is I retired, but I don™t think that 
happened right away. 
I don™t know what I 
was doing th at year. I don™t rememb er what
 year that came, that material came. 
Q: When you, in the process of -- of se
eing these documents and things, did you li -- 
did you come across anything specific about
 anybody in your family that -- or your 
parent™s -- 

A: Just names. I did s -- find an -- names 
of my  father and my  uncle. Nobody else. 
But of course, I had seen -- I ha -- I had -- 
came late, and they had 
looked at most of 
the list before that. Lucy found some thi
ngs for me. In the museum there are other 

things that we found that 
had been borrowed from the arch
ives before and they are 
already on microfiche in the li -- in the 
museum. There are -- there are papers from 
my mother™s side of the family. Grandfather, 
aunt, uncle, all my mother™s side of the 
family, cousins. There are p -- there are pape
rs that they had to 
-- f-forms they had to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
67
fill out declaring their worldly 
goods and that™s -- tha-th at™s very sad to just look at, 
you know, because here it is, you know, 
a nine year old ch ild declaring her 
possessions and it says things like, you kn
ow, one winter coat, one sp ring jacket, 
three dresses, two pairs of shoes, one gol
d chain. You know, it™s just awful, just 
awful. So, you know, I contin
ue working on it, I™ve -- I™ve -- I-I can steel myself and 
do these things because I feel
 like the language is so im
portant, and there are so few 
people that can translate and so -- and that 
can un -- that understa
nd that world, so -- 
so I do it. It™s not what I thought I woul
d do. I thought if I would volunteer, I was 
planning on volunteering maybe at the S
ackler or someplace like that. I like Asian 
artists, you notice.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: And, you know, I -- I like art and I love
 music and I -- I got involved, you know, 
in the [indecipherable] mo rning mu sic cl
ub and helped  my  friend organize mu sic 
competitions. It™s more, you know, what
 my -- you know. I go to  more chamber 
mu sic concerts, but it™s okay. 
Q: Do you think that -- has it fo
rced you to examine things -- 
A: Hugely, hugely. 
Q: -- in a way that you might not have otherw ise? 

A: Hugely. It™s been -- it™s 
been eye-opening in many wa
ys and -- and I have gotten 
enormously educated th rough th e process. I ju
st sort of -- I think what I -- what I did 

is not that it didn™t touch me, but I didn™t allow me -- allow it to touch me. I think 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
68
one of the ways that I dealt with the whole 
issue was the -- to just not think about it. 
And -- 
Q: You mean all those years that -- 

A: All those years.  

Q: 60™s, 70™s. 
A: Yeah -- well, no. 
Q: After you came back? 

A: Those years not even so -- yeah, I sup
pose so. I just -- you know, early childhood 
and you know, just thinking 
about what had happened . An
d I would just always say 
well, I was very lucky and you know, I -- 
I know other people suffered and suffered 
terribly, but I was very lucky, so I™ll just 
take my luck and run with it. But it™s not -- 
it™s -- right now I don™t feel differently a
bout myself, but I -- I think it -- I think it 
was -- I have a greater understanding. I-I think 
it™s still sort of intellectual rather than 
emotional. I still don™t like the 
emotional to -- to get me. I fe
el like I -- as I said to 
my  aunt, every -- every time that you -- that 
you let yourself suffer is one point for 
them and one loss for you. And I™m not going to let it happen, if I can help it. So, I 
don™t know, maybe it™s Pollyanna-ish in my  
way, but -- in -- in -- in a way, but -- 
Q: But it -- there™s something in  you th at it 
-- it -- you worked hard to  help and to do 
things -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- and this fulfills part of that as well -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
69
A: I think so . 
Q: -- because it™s something you can do. 
A: That™s something that I can do, and I feel 
that that™s -- yeah, I do those things that 
-- that -- so rt of like I can move in a pos
itive way. And -- but I can -- that out of -- 
out of these ashes -- I don™t want to be 
-- I don™t want to be dramatic, but that 
something good comes, that
 I -- y ou know, the never again business is -- is 
important, and -- and it™s -- and it™s real. And I -- I think that it does -- the history 

does need  to be understood, and -- and -- 
and I don™t understand enough so -- so -- 
but I have -- so -- so I™m -- I™ve been le
arning, because I™ve ha
d to -- I™ve had to 
learn about things, you know. Like, for ex
ample I™m -- never knew because certainly 
wasn™t taught to me, anything ab out wh at
 was happening in Dalmatia during that 

time, for example, to Jews. I mean I don™t 
ha -- didn™t have the foggiest idea about, 
you know, the -- the camps that were run 
wa -- you know, in Italy and -- I me an, I -- 

I saw Italians as the enemy, because that™s
 w h at I was taught. The Italians were the 

southern enemy and it was very nice when 
we got rid of them, and we won against 
them, but of course, you know -- and it was the partisans, of course, that chased them 

out of Dalmatia. That was how I saw thin
gs. Never a -- never realizing, you know, 
that if not for Italians, many more Jews w
ould have been killed,
 and that, you know, 
that m -- some -- many of my 
friends survived there a -- a
nd that, you know, th-there 
were uprisings there. There was the first Je
w ish brigade. I mean, all of that, that -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
70
that whole -- that whole chunk of hist
ory I knew nothing about. And I™m very 
grateful that I do know it, and --  
Q: When  you came to this work , did you 
have -- I think I know th e answer, but I 
want to ask, did you have questions that
 you needed answered, or you just came  

upon these things not kn
owing that you™d had ga
ps in your knowledge? 
A: No, I knew that I had gaps, and -- 

Q: And -- and -- but now that you™ve done 
this for a few years, do -- do you -- has it 

completed something in you th
at was incomplete? Has it answered questions for you 
that you maybe didn™t 
even know you had? 
A: Yeah, I think it -- it does, and -- and it 
-- it™s -- it™s the ques
tions, some that I 
perhap s didn™t know I had, but some that
 I did know I had. Cause I had -- I think I 
was very aware that I had, and I still have
 big chunks of -- of
 missing knowledge, 
historical knowledge. And of co urse, you 
know, I would like to know mo re about, 
you know, how -- what my  fami ly did, or 
I -- you know, I -- esp
ecially my mother™s 
side of the family, there is nobody living 
to know about their 
childhood and I know 
nothing, and I have lo ts and lots of pict
ures, and I always kne
w that I -- I always 
know that I knew more about them, because my uncle lived 
there, too, and so I knew 
about them. But I don™t know anything a
bout their, you know, feelings, thoughts, 
where they were going, what they were 
doing. And I rememb er my  cousin s very 
well, and I s -- I do mi ss them. Because I gr
ew up with those pictures, you know, and 
it™s kind of sad. I grew up with those pictur
es and I grew  up with -- with their clothes 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
71
and their toys, and when I think about that so
metimes, it™s a sort 
of a -- an emotional 
soft par -- spot. But -- but in terms of just
 general knowledge of what was going on 
there, I -- I have -- I have chunks that I 
still d on™t -- don™t know, and -- and I just -- I 
just sort of s -- thought, you know, oh, I don
™t want to -- I don™t want to think about 
it, I don™t want to know it because I don™t -- 
I don™t want to feel sad and I don™t want 
to feel upset, and -- and you know, people sa
y to me now, you know, oh it™s so brav e 
of you to work there. And I don™t feel it™s
 brave of me to work there, but it™s not -- 
it™s not the mo st amusing th ing, let™s put 
it that way. I mean, you know, yo-you have 
that yourself, you know, how much of that
 do you want to hear? And I grew -- I 
joined a group a few years ago, since 
I™ve started work ing -- well, maybe not.  
Q: I have s -- let me tu rn this over. 
A: Mm-hm. 
End of Tape Two, Side B

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Dora Klayman. This is 
tape number three, side A. Yo
u -- you started to say that 
you join ed a group -- 
A: I joined a group of ch
ild Holocaust survivors in 
the area, Washington area, do 
you know ab out that group? It was just by 
accident. I sort of didn™t even realize it 
was -- that it existed. And th
en I found out abou
t it from a fellow who also originally 
came from Croatia. I met him at Flori Dra
gota™s and he is, you know, very -- has 
very different reactions from mine, and he
™s quite bitter and u
nhappy in many ways. 
And he said that this is the place that he
™s very happy with, because he could never 
talk about what had happened, wh ich I di
dn™t have any trouble w -- you a -- asked 
me that before. I didn™t go around talking 
about it, but if anybody ever asked, I 
talked about it. Well, h e said he -- he wa
-was into denial in 
many ways, until he met 
this group. And I can™t remember exactly
 when the group put itself together and 
how, but it™s fairly decent size, an d it -- it 
did one thing for me, and that is it said, 
okay, I am a Holocaust surviv
or, because children -- and 
that -- everybody in that 
group says that, that those of us, especially 
those of us who were hidden, that™s really 
the -- I mean, there is now a special group fo r that, but among th is group of 
childhood Holo caust survivors, 
some of them were in camps and some of them were 
not. Many were not. And -- like my -- my da
ughter-in-law™s mother, from -- w ho is 
from Poland lost practically all of her fa
mily. Everybodyexcept 
her -- I think one 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
73
uncle and her mo ther. And she is mu ch
 more acting traum -- was much more 
traumatized  by it -- by it than I. And sh
e mentions it -- something about the 
Holocaust practically every time I see he
r. Now, wh ether she does it because she 
knows I went through th e experience, or
 whether it™s general, I don™t know. But 
people either -- I know people who talk ab ou
t it a lot, like my aunt, or people who 
never talk about it. I was probably someplace
 in the middle. And s-so -- so this -- 
this -- this fellow said they 
will -- had this gro
up and I said oh, I™d like to come and 
see. So I have joined  the group sinc
e, and have -- it™s supposed  -- it™s been 
interesting to listen to other 
people™s experiences, and to --to see to what extent -- I -
- I™m -- I w as also trying to categorize,
 you know, are people who lived in camp s 
different from those who didn™t, or there a -- 
are -- there i -- there is a sort of great 
affinity among people who came from differe
nt countries, I noti
ced. You know, just 
to -- there are many people from Poland
, for example, and many -- fewer from 
Germany or certainly fewer from Croatia. 
And people meet -- we meet once a month 
and people bring food to  share and there 
is a program. And some of the program -- 
for a long time they did almost nothi
ng but taken turns 
to talk about -- 
Q: Themselves. 
A: -- themselves. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And many of them would say th at this is 
the first time that th
ey had talked about 
themselves to anybody. And many of them 
have talked about their relationship to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
74
their kids, or how th eir kids don™t really -- 
so me of them feel that th eir kids don™t 
care to hear about it, and others have kids 
who are very involved, 
and -- an-and so on 
and so forth. It™s -- it™s -- it™s been
 sort of an eye opener for me, too. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: To be -- to be with th ese people. So
me of them are involved in doing volunteer 
work , many of -- a numb er of them are volunteering at the Holo caust mu seum. And 

so that™s sort of b
een an interesting experience for me, to o. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And -- so I -- I find that I much m -- so
me of them have become personal friends, 
so it™s -- it™s -- it™s sort of 
the -- somehow I™m so more -- 
so  mu ch  mo re 
involved in 
thinking or doing or m -- or meeting with
 people. I went to th -- there was a -- 
recently, just a few mo nths ago there was a huge meeting at the Mayflower of the 

hidden ch ildren. So  it™s a -- you know, with seminars and -- and speeches and 
personal explorations, and -- so th
is is just a -- sort of a
nother world I™ve sort of been 
in lately. 
Q: Mm-hm. What about your kids and -- 
and I-I™m assu ming all along here that your 
kids know your story and -- 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: -- you™ve never had any trouble telling 
them about it and wanted them to know, 
I™m sure. 

A: Yeah, they know the story.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
75
Q: Yeah. 
A: They nev -- they don™t as
k questions. I™ve -- I™ve yet to -- ask to see -- to hear one 
of them -- well, maybe they asked questions
 as children, I can™t remember. B u t right 
now, as adults, maybe they feel that they
 know ev erything. They  don™t ask, I don™t 
tell anything. I just -- we never get on that subject.  

Q: Do you think -- oftentimes
 people s-say their kids are afraid to ask because they 
think it™s painful for you. 

A: Possible. I have never asked. I think now we are getting to a stage where my  
grandchildren will know about it. In fact
, Daniella, who is now
 nine and a half 
started talking ab out Anne Frank recently. 
Apparently her mo ther has been reading it 
with her. And I don™t -- I didn't talk to Iona
, to her mother, to see w h at that was all 
about. Daniella is pretty with it, so you 
know, she -- for a nine and a half year old, 
she -- she reads well, and sh e understands a 
lot. And the other day we were talking 
about the black experien ce, and she was 
talking to  me about the underground 
railroad. So I™m sure she co
uld understand some of that. 
She goes to Hebrew school, 
so they must have been talking ab
out -- about it there for Yom HaShoah. 
Q: Mm. 
A: But I have not had the time to sit down with  her and sort of obliquely say 

something to see if she w
ill come up with so mething. 
Obviously I™m not going to 
start telling her anything unless I feel that
 sh e must know. I -- I -- y ou know, with 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
76
your gran dchildren you don™t know exactly
 when they™re rea
dy for what, because 
you don™t have them every 
day and I-I -- I don™t want to
 dump anything on them. 
Q: Yeah. It™s always an interesting -- ther
e™s -- it™s an interesti
ng issue that comes up 
in all these interviews is
, when do you tell them -- 
A: When do you tell.  
Q: -- how do you tell them, and -- 
A: I have not the foggiest idea, I h ave no 
memory of when I told my kids. I think 
probably  they were asking que
stion -- you know, they  were 
in Croatia with me when 
they were very little. A nd I prob
ably told them early that 
my parents were killed in a 
war. I don™t know whether I told them how, 
or -- I think I told them why. And I may 
have told them how, I may have told them
 they got killed in concentration camps, 
but they  probably fo und out 
later on what that meant. I don™t know that -- I don™t 
know -- I d -- I d -- I do -- I can™t think of th
 -- of any time when I had this moment 
where I would sit them down and talk to them about it, no. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: I don™t remember that. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I may have, but I rather doubt it. 

Q: Mm-hm. What -- wh-wh-what was it like 
for you when  war broke out again in the 
90™s? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
77
A: Oh, I was very upset. And again, th
at probably again has to do with my  
experience in post-war Yugoslavia as a -- 
as a product of communist education. I 
really felt like they -- they -- 
they need to stay togethe
r. I -- and I -- I just wanted 
United States to go and bomb  Serb ia and 
stop the war. I think I was right, but the 
Croats -- I still feel -- think I was right, 
but I don™t know whether you were reading 
Louis in the ﬁNew York Times.ﬂ He -- I -- I 
really agreed with 
his point of view. I 
think people here -- I mean, the politicians
 here, the government felt -- you know, 
they thought it was going to be another Vi
etnam. No, I mean, Iraq is going to be 
another Vietnam, but herl -- but Yugoslavia
 could have been sa
ved, but not by -- by 
doing wh at [indecipherable] was doing, like 
siding with Milose
vic. But -- but by 
getting him out of power and 
-- and reestablishing law and order and -- and -- and 
some semb lance of demo cracy. 
Q: During those early days wh en Slovenia
 broke away and then it was sort of -- 
A: Croatia. 
Q: -- Croatia -- tension was building in  Croa
tia and then Bosn ia. Were your friends 
asking you what -- what™s going on
 wi -- because I remember I -- 
A: Everybody. 

Q: Yeah. Who -- who could u
nderstand it? I mean, it™s just -- it was so hard for 
people to grasp. 
A: I was trying to explain to them -- ev
erybody was asking me and I was trying to  
explain th at it™s not a Vietnam and that 
it could be stopped easily. I think it could 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
78
have been stopped very  easily from the beginn
ing. I was starting to explain th at there 
are -- th-the business of, you know, the et
hnic animosity is age long -- you know, 
ages long. Well, of course there were, but
 I mean -- so there 
are between the north 
and the so uth in the United States, but we
 don™t go killing each
 other, you know. 
Yeah, there are -- there are crazies running ar
ound in bars and stripes, so what, you 
know? And the fact that I fe
lt like, you know, you could 
have -- yo -- if you had that 
kind of leadership in  United States, you co ul
d have th is country in a -- in turmoil at 
no time at all. You get a lot of those Nazi 
party types, or you 
know, David wh atever 
his name was, or somebody elected t-t --  
Q: You™re talking ab out the guy from Louisiana? 

A: Yes, what was his name? 

Q: Can™t think of his last name. 
A: I mean, people like that can stir up et
hnic hatreds in two seconds. I mean, you 
know, Latinos, blacks, you know, the -- citie
s could burn. I mean
, you have to  -- you 
have to have the kind of l
eadership that says no, this 
will not do. We cannot have 
that kind of behavior and -- and do -- instead
 of allowing that kind of -- that kind of, 
you know, leadership to -- to 
go on, I -- I just -- I just 
felt like it was -- it™s such a 
pity. I mean, my  Croatian friends, mind you, 
don™t feel that way. I mean, they feel 
that -- they feel that they ar
e -- they are very happy to be 
rid of Serbs. They are very 
happy to be rid of Yu goslavia and co
mmunism. Okay, communism I can see, but 
you know, if they wanted to 
separate, it could have been  
done later, I mean the -- but 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
79
if, you know, if Romania can make it, a
nd -- and Po land can make it, Yugoslavia 
could have made it. I don™t know. I -- I --
 it™s -- it™s a pity, I think. I don™t know. 
Q: Yeah. – What -- I -- I™ve kind of come ac
ross all my questions, but there mu st be 
things that I didn 't hit u
pon. I me an, obviously we could go on fo r a long time, but 
there mu st be something th at I haven™t aske
d you that you™d like to talk about, or 
some -- 
A: [inaudible] have anything, I don™t know
. – I don™t know, what didn™t we talk 
about? 
Q: You™ve had a very  interesting, une -- 
everybody™s story is unique, but yours is 
quite unusual from so many -- 
A: You think? 

Q: -- that I™ve done, because in -- I don™t 
know, you seem to have, probably because 
of -- it™s probably a personality thing, but you
™ve moved so -- in such a straight line 
and -- and eithe -- coped well, it s
eems like in -- in -- in every -- 
A: It must be persona
lity. I was really lucky. 
Q: In every phase, in ever -- well, you thi
nk of yourself as lucky, too, you know? 
A: Mm-hm. Yeah. 

Q: So you™ve adapted to a lo
t of tre-tremendous upheaval. 
A: I was -- I -- I really wo
uld have [indecipherable] 
Q: Which -- which can tear people apart, emotionally -- 

A: Right. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
80
Q: -- and you seem to have really had a pr
agmatic, sort of optim
istic way of dealing 
with all these things. 
A: True, and I think -- I think it™s my Shoah tape, I -- which I haven™t seen the whole 

thing either, but I reme mb er doing it and I 
rememb er talking about everything and I 
cried at the very end because I think -- we
ll, I think as the loss of my parents as 
being a horrendous thing. I think it was ho
rrendous for them, and I don™t think it™s as 
horrendous for me, which is a horrible thing to
 say, but because I have no memory of 
it. I can imagine what must have been lik e, now that I have children. After I had 
children, I was thinking of it. What must ha
ve been like for my  parents to have given 
me away? Basically, that™s wh
at they did. And even  wo rs
e for my -- to -- to give 
away my  brother. [phone ringing][tape break] 
Q: -- it™s harder -- you think harder 
when th ey gave up your brother? 
A: I think ab out my  brother because I le
ft -- I left almost like I™m going to my 

grandparents and I™m going so rt of like -- 

Q: For a visit. 
A: -- who knows, you know, for a vi
sit and maybe I™ll be back. Maybe 
[indecipherable] maybe -- maybe it™ll be -- al
l be okay. But my  brother, they were 
already in jail and he was a 
baby and my  mother handed him away. So it mu st have 
been just horrendous. I think 
fo r me and my  -- of course, my  uncle died wh en  he was 

in his 80™s, so that was sad, but you expe
ct older people to die. But to lose my 
husband wh en I did was really a horren
dous experience. That was the worst.

Q: Yeah. You were quite young. 
A: Yeah, I was 54. And I think -- the reas
on I say I™m lu ck -- I was lucky -- and I 
was, because I had these people through my
 life, you know, first my uncle and then 
my husband, who really were there for me 
to lean on and -- and -- and ju st continue, 
you know, in my  nice, as you 
say, straight way. If not for them, I don™t know wh at 
my  life would have been like.
 It would have been -- I -- 
I may have -- I -- I was born 
with -- with -- with a person -- with th
is personality, but who knows how my 
personality would have been 
developed ha
d I not had them. So, yes I™m lucky that I 
was -- that I was born -- I mean, it™s good th
at I was born this way and I ha -- that I 
have the personality I have, but -- but I was 
extremely lucky to -- to have -- to have 
had that op -- you know, to have had thes
e people in my life. And -- and later on, 
you know, to have my  childre
n, who are, you know, who 
were here, and -- and a lot 
of friends. That, of course, you know, could 
have all been different. Let™s say that I 
continued living in Long Island, let™s say th
at I didn't meet my  husband, that I went 
back to Yugoslavia. I™m very glad to have 
-- to have been able 
to -- to turn back 
toward being Jewish, which I knew nothing 
about. I knew I was 
Jewish, but it meant 
nothing. 
Q: When did it start to 
mean something to you? 

A: I think -- you know, I have early, ea
rly rememb rances both 
pro and con. I don™t 
think I ever told anybody this story. I reme
mber in ne -- a story of rejection. I had a 

little - - this is true confession story. I don™
t think I ever told anyone. I -- I r emember 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
82
that I had, I don™t know why it was mine, 
but I had a little Moge
n Davide, that was 
family™s. And why, at one time, mu st have 
been in one of those 
times when I felt like 
being Jewish was horrible because, you kno
w, children told me that Jews killed 
Christ and it was terrib le. And I gave that 
away. I gave it to one 
of my  -- one of the 
like farmer girls, peasant girls. And I said, 
well, I™m not going to  need this. So th at™s 
story one. Then  story two, I reme mb er findi
ng papers in the house, and I found a -- 
the music for [indecipherable] and I could 
play the piano and I play ed that and 
somehow like from some other world, that 
sounded very emotiona
lly stirring to me. 
And I don™t know how old I wa
s. I was fairly young. And 
then, of course, came my -
- the watershed trip to -- to -- to Switzerla
nd, when  all of a sudden I found my self in 
an Orthodox family. And -- but -- but I had 
such a good feeling 
toward my uncle, 
that -- my father™s brother. I-I remember 
seeing him as he waited -- he came to wait 
for me at th e border and the train came in
to the border and I™m looking out a window 
and I™m thinking, am I going to  recognize him? But I did, and he recognized me 
immediately. We did excha
nge pictures, but still I tho
ught I might not recognize 
him, and I was fairly scared. That was 1954,
 I think, I was young and -- high school 
kid. And I had this really very warm expe
rience and very  emotional experience that 
this was someone I was related to. I had ne
ver -- I -- I hadn™t -- from the time th at I 
was like seven, when I saw my other co -- 
uncle for the last time, I never had any -- 
met any family members. It was so -- it was stirring. And then 
coming into this 
family, I w as very willing to -- to learn and 
to find out and to think -- to accept the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
83
fact that I was Jewish and -- 
and everything that went with
 it. And you know, at that 
point, I mean that -- that -- 
that -- that Mogen Davide experience was I must h ave 
been like eight years old or something. 
Was very long time ago. And -- but I -- I 
remembered it because I often 
thought about it later and I kind of regretted it. So it 
was -- it was sort of a new -- an -- an -- an 
-- an experience that -- that I was willing 
to -- to accept and it just felt -- it felt right, ju
st sort of right. And, you know, when -- 
when I met Dan, of course, I -- I didn™t kn
ow he was Jewish, because I couldn™t tell 
Jews. I can -- you know, now I can. It™s 
like I couldn™t tell on the phone somebody 
who was from the south, and certainly so
meone who was black, I couldn™t tell. I 
remember being totally surpri
sed that Dan once got off th
e phone and said, this was 
a black lady and she wanted
 to know this and that. 
I was like, how do you know? 
You were on the phone. Are you clairvoy
ant or something? I didn™t understand 
anything about language, and so I c
ouldn™t un -- I didn™t know anything about 
people™s physiognomy or reco
gnizing anything special, or
 expressions or anything. 
Anyway  -- and of course -- and he -- he, 
who would normally have recognized it, 
didn™t recognize it in me because he neve
r expected the Jew 
from Yugoslavia, in 
Yugoslavia, I should say. Because you know,
 people think, oh well, they were all 
annihilated and who knows wh ether th
ere were any. I mean, who knows -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- what about Yugoslavia? Dan was really
 savvy, but still he didn™t know. So I 
remember when -- when the ex
citement, overall excitement, and I -- you see, I -- I ex 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
84
-- I w -- this is -- this is actually going back
 to one of your questions that I -- I would 
tell people. In like my  third letter I wrote to
 him about my  history, because he asked 
me what I was doing in  Sw itzerland. And I wo
uld have just said I™m visiting in -- an 
uncle and an  aunt.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But I went through th e whole story and I 
told him that -- that
 they had surv ived  
Bergen-Belsen and they are in Switzerland 
since the end of the war, and that my 
parents had been killed, and that -- that I™m
 living with them for a year. And so he 
wrote immediately back in saying how ex cite
d he was to find out that I was Jewish 
because he was Jewish too, and there was 
great excitement in the -- in the family, 
because I told them. So it -- so
 that alone tells me that I 
was always very open about 
my  experience. And -- and I -- I just -- I ju
st -- I don™t know. I -- I just -- you know, 
felt right about it. My aunt, of course, always
 says that it™s in the blood because I -- I 
learned all the kosher rules and everything very fast.  
Q: And about -- and how about yo
ur kids, are they religious? 
A: No, no. They™re not religi
ous. Wanda™s particularly not religious, but -- but they 
feel -- they -- they -- they feel very Jewish
. Elliot is -- Elliot ma
rried a Jewish girl 
and they are -- they belong to
 Avas Israel and the kids 
go to Hebrew school. They ™re 
not very religious, but they follow holid
ay s and I don™t know
, you know. I think 
some of it is Iona™s doing. Bu
t that™s often so, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm.

A: Women -- 
Q: Seem to be the carriers of the -- 
A: -- seem to be the carriers, yeah, of -- 
of customs and so on. I don™t know what 
Elliot would have done 
on his own. Not that he doesn™t 
feel very Jewish, but he may 
not -- they  don™t -- neither of them is particularly observant. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So -- 

Q: And, you know -- but I think, you know
, I think one of -- one of -- well, I don™t 
know. I -- I -- I don™t know to what extent th
ey would be mo re obs
ervant in different 
circumstan ces or what. They both went 
thro ugh Hebrew school
, especially Wanda. 
She was -- I think that -- I think both kids 
are pretty much the way my husband was, 
who also wasn™t observant 
and didn™t particularly -- you
 know, I had to drag  him 
away to -- to -- to ho
lidays. And so  when I say to Wa
nda anything, she says, I™m just 
like my father, so that™s it. And -- a
nd -- but yet, he felt very Jewish -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- in -- in every way. It™s just that he
 always felt like that™s
 too mu ch pray ing. 
Q: Too much praying. I want 
to ask you one question. I™m 
going to flip the tape over

Q: This is a continuation of the Unite
d States Holo caust Memo rial Museum 
interview with Dora Klayman. 
This is tape number three, 
side B. Something that has 
-- often comes up is relationship with Ameri
can relatives when y
ou come here, a lot 
of people have had very  tens
e relationships with their -- 
with people that they™ve 
become related to. Someti -- you know, for 
all kinds of reasons. Sometimes because 
there really isn™t any understanding of wh
at happened on either side. I™m wondering 
what it -- if you™d like to shar
e something about that, if -- if -- if anything like that 
was -- because sometimes, you know, someb
ody comes from another country, those 
were times -- they were different times.
 And I know I -- you know, you heard all 
kinds of slurs about people who came to th
is country,no matte
r where they were 
from, east Europe -- from Europe or easte
rn Europe or whatev
er. So anyway, I™m 
just wondering if you had -- 

A: Well, another bit of luck. I think th
e fact that my in-laws and that whole 
generation of people, their siblings, were 
all immigrants. They all came early, but 
they came in the 1920™s, made a h uge diffe
rence. So, my husband and -- and all the -
- and his brother and all the cousins, they
 were all first g eneration. They had all 
grown up with parents who talked  about 
the old country, and so I was accepted 
absolutely totally andcompletely into the family. And 
they have -- that family has 
been abso lutely fantastic to me. A nd after 
Dan™s death, cause he -- he was the oldest 
of the -- of the children, and he di -- of th
at generation -- he was the oldest of that 
generation and he died first. And the -- th
e ca -- the cousins -- well, his brother is, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
87
you know, very close to me, but all -- but 
that™s almost to be
 expected, but the 
cousins have all absolutely rallied around me 
and I am absolutely part of that family, 
totally. The cousins that I mentioned befo
re who were -- lived 
in Arlington, th ey 
eventually returned
, had lived all over and then they 
came from -- th-t
hey™re -- they 
were in England and they™re now in Arlingt
on. And I see them all the time, we went 
to the march yesterday together. And the 
other cousin, this pe
rson™s brother, Danny 
who lives in Long Island, they were just he
re also, they went to a wedding here, and 
they stayed with me. So it™s just we™re -- we
 are very -- everybody is very close, and 
their children are close to my
 children. My children, unf
ortunately, don™t have any 
cousins. Their -- I only have these two 
children and my  brother-in-law had no 
children and I have no siblings, so my  child
ren have no cousin s. And they pretty 
much consider Dan™s cousin™s children thei
r cousin s and -- and they ™re quite close. 
So I was s-super, super lucky on that score as well. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: In fact, A-A-Aunt Mara, my mother™s 
sister, who lived a -- 
in Long Island and 
her -- her son Paul is exactly my age. An
d she was constantly telling him why o -- a-
asking him why couldn™t he
 cou -- why couldn™t he go and marry somebody from 
Europe? That would be so nice. Oh, he ma
rried a no -- he married a lovely American 
girl whom I adore, Joan, and that™s that. 
But anyway, they -- the -- that -- I did not 
have that -- that problem, because, m-main
ly I think people face 
that with families 
who have, you know, been he
re for a very long time and -- and have gotten totally, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
88
you know, im -- Americanized. 
My in-laws were -- used to joke that you can take -- 
which is probably why they liv
ed the way I -- they lived, 
you know, I -- we used to 
say that -- that they came out of the shtetl,
 but they couldn™t -- you can take them out 
of the shtetl, but you can™t take the sh
tetl out of them, you know. And you know, 
Mom was always satisfied with very little. Sh
e never wanted very 
much of anything, 
you know, and they  -- they we
re super -- had super modest way of life. And ju st, you 

know, they were very, very 
-- still very, very much part 
of the old country, even 
though, you know the-they
 came here, they stru -- they re
ally struggled hard in life. 
My father-in-law came here with no English.
 He was 20 years old. He came with no 
money. How he ever -- and 
he was not a l -- a -- a -- a language learner. In fact, I 
mean, to hi -- to the end of his life, and hedied in his 90™s, he spoke English in si -- 

with -- with great deal of Yiddish and -- th
rown in and whatever. And -- but he -- he 
-- and he -- but he made it through -- thro
ugh -- through school and -- and got a d -- 
degree in pharmacy and became a pharmacist,
 a licensed pharmacist 
in the state -- in 
the state of New Yo rk, and -- and had -- 
had -- had a small, you know, sort of 
professional kind of a drugst
ore, you know, not -- no -- 
no pri -- n-no co unter, just -- 
just drugs. So, you know, how they made
 it on, you know -- a-and so every fe -- 
every little bit that they had,
 it was like there and preserve
d and -- and so  they lived a 
sort of -- in -- and they were very, very
 American in their eye -- you know, pro-
American, but their outlook wa
s very much steeped
 in Europe, in old Europe, yeah. 
And it™s -- Mom went to -- Mom came -- ha d a easier time coming, because she 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079
 
 
 
89
already had an uncle here. But you know, 
she -- you know, th-th-they -- they were 
also lucky in a sense that th ey -- they got educated reas
onably well in Europe. They 
both went through high school, wh ich was no
t a very common thing in those days in 
-- in Russian. So -- and Mom 
spoke English quite well, and sh -she was much more 
of a language person than Pop, but -- a
nd, you know, we had -- we had the usual, 
you know, daughter, in-laws relationship so
metimes, w h ere you -- but -- but the -- 
th-the -- the problems I had with them we
re mo stly problems that my  husband had 
with them, too, rather than
, you know, just you know, mo
stly -- I don™t know what 
the problems were like, you know, are you goi
ng to buy this sofa or that sofa, or you 
can™t buy the house, it™s so expensive. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Or whatever now, since it™s -- 
Q: It™s just the normal st
uff that e v erybody has --  
A: Just the normal stuff, yeah. 
Q: Right. 
A: Nothing that -- that would be related 
to my  being from another -- from another 
world, also.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: They were much more 
from another world than I. 
Q: Hm. Hm. [indecipherable] Good. I -- I -- I think I™m done. 

A: Good.

Q: Un-U nless there™s something else you™
d like to talk about. [indecipherable] 
A: No, I -- I wish -- I so wish that we ha
d done a tape like that
 with my husband, I 
have so little from him.  
Q: Hm. 

A: It™s a very -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s rea
lly good. I think all -- every family should do 
that. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Never mind -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Never mind hav -- this having to  do with  
a particular issue that other people may 
-- may want to understand later on. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: But it™s just -- just to understand what 
goes on in families and how they relate to 
each other and to the world. That wo
uld be an interesting thing to do. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you. 

A: Thank you so  mu ch.
