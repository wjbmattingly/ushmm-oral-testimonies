Manny Mandel was born to a religious Jewish fam ily on May 8, 1936 in Riga, Latvia. Manny 

was just 3 whenW orldW ar II started.Although he was born in Riga,Latvia, Manny'sf am ily

Shortly af ter Manny's birth, hisf atheraccepted apostas a chief cantor in Budapest, and the 

fam ily returned to Hungar y, where they had lived bef ore 1933. Hungary is highlighted on this

[Applause]
 
>> Manny Mandel:T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson: Manny, thank you so muchfor joining us and being wi lling to be our 
F i rs t  

P
ersontoday.  And welcom e toall your fam ily m em bers. T his isterrif ic to have all of  youhere.
 
You have a greatdealto share with us, so we'll begin right awa y.  You were born in Riga in 

1936.  But yourfam ily's stay there was a short onebefore youm oved to Poland on Septem ber 

1, 1939 when you were 3
-
years old. Let™s start with you telling us about your fam ily and why 

 
3
 
your parents were in Budapest in the years leading uptothe startof W orldW ar II and the 
Holocaust?
 

>> Manny Mandel: My parents areboth Hungarian.  My m other comesf rom  southern Hungary 

which you m ight know better as theformer Yugoslavia.  M y f ather com esf romEastern 

Hungary, andT ransylvania, called Count Dracula. T hey did not know each other.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: You told me of a signif icant story your m other told along the lines of som eone 

saying, ﬁ You now speak Yugoslavian.ﬂ
 
W hat ' s t he  s i gn i fica n c e of  th a t?
 

>> Manny Mandel:W hen the f irst world war cam e toanend in1918, that part of  Hunga
r y w a s  

choppedoff, because it was on the losing side and itbecam e the new country called 

Yugoslavia.  You know m any countries, Serbia, Croatia and sof orth.  One who is here isf rom  

Croatia. W hatever class she's in when she's10 years old, she was told one day with the rest 

of  the kids, that as oftom orrow, over the weekend, the languageof  instruction will change from  

Hungarian to Serbo
-
Croatian.
 
T o which the kids said, f ine.T hey were totally bilingual.  You need to understandthere's not 

one item of  sim ilarity between Hungarianand Croatian. T hat was her experiencehaving had a 

change inthe country and a change inthe neighborhood.
 
>> Bill Benson: Yourf ather was a very im portant cantor in Budapest. How did heachieve that?
 
>> Manny Mandel: My father as a young boy,apparently had a lovely voice and was able to 

lead certain services f rom his village where he was going up.  Andhe went to school, the 

religious schools in those days were called Yeshivas, they still are. My f ather was ordained as 

a f ul
l-
f ledged rabbi in bothof them . Butthatwas not his interest. He was conscripted intothe 
Czech arm y.  His part of  Hungary becam e Czechoslovakia. W hile in thearmy hehad 

occasion tobe invitedto participate in som eparticular kindof  perf ormance with which he knew 

nothing.  It was calledan opera. T hey put on these kind of  variousperf ormances,m y father 

was trained because he had a beautiful voice to sing inopera.
 
He did this, after this he decided som ebody heard his voiceand decidedtoask him  t
o go  
through the 
C
antors 
I
nstitute in Vienna af ter army service, which hedid.  He became a 
prof essional cantor where he studiedm usicand voice and singing and did thatfor the restof  

your lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson: You said that yourf ather thought hehad tr
u ly " Hit  t he  b ig t im e. "  S a y a  b it 
about that.  If heever expressed regret about accepting the position in Budapest?
 
>> Manny Mandel: For those of us who knew som ething about the Jewish com munity of  

central Europe, we would know that cities like Vienna an
d Budapest were m ajor, m ajor 

centers. And to have the positionof being achief  cantor in Budapest was his achievement of  

them etropolitan opera.  T hat's what he wanted to do. T hat's whathe was able toachieve.
 
For those of you who don't know anything about synagogue life, youneed to understandthe 

synagogue where hewas the cantor hadam ale choir of 40 voices. T hat's white a job.  Had 

his involvem ent here, he becam ea cantorand remained thatfor the rest of his lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson: He had offersf rom places asfar as London.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Hebecam e a citizen of Czechoslovakia becauseof  the Czech Arm y. T he 

Hungarian Government would not give him  working papers. He had opportunities to go and 

see if he could geta job som eplaceelse,one of  them
 
being London, another being in Holland 
andother places.  And eventually in Riga.  
 

But regrets? He hadm ajor regrets that hedid not take aposition in London.  Had he done 

 
4
 
that, he would have been moved outof  Hungary and survi ved the war.  Membersof  
th e  f amily 
did not survive.  Unfortunately, the synagogue in London was bombed and destroyed. T hat 

was during the war.  
 

His regret was that he didn't takethe message that said leave central Europe. But that's not 

what he did not want to do.
 
>> B ill B e n
son:W hile thefullf orceof  the war andthe Holocaust would not hit your comm unity 
in Hungary until 1944,there were still many diff iculties once war was underway in Europe in 

thefall of 1939.Please tell usabout the circum stancesfor yourf am ily and you in the early 

years of the war.
 
>> Manny Mandel: AsI remember these things as a young child, the war was a much larger 

issue to us than the Holocaust. T hat early.  As Bill just said, the Holocaust didn't really arrive 

in Hungary until March 14, 1944. So '41, '42,'43, bom bings once ortwice.  Various rules were 

changed, which did not im pact on a6 or7

year

old kid.  
 
But I didhave to goto school with the yellow star. T hoseof  you who have been through the 

m useum , you will see them displayed. T he yellow star and thoughtwas a m ajor kind of am ark 

of  distinction.  Found out it wasn't. It was a target, because kids and adults and otherson 

occasion were whacked on the headfor walking on the street. 
 
Because there was a yellow star, that's license to
 
whackon thehead.  I'm  told when I was in 
f irst grade, I think. I was walking to schooland every day som ebody would follow m e. Alm ost 

ever y day.  Andunderstand that we live at num ber13of  the street,andthe school was 

number44. T wo blocks away.  
 
Somebody would follow m e just to ensure that Idid not get whacked on the head.  Just 

because I had a yellow star. Letm e add a couple things here.  Asadigression, one of the 

tim es that m yf ather was hom ef rom  hisduties in in cam p.  I was big enough t
o rid e  a s ma ll 
bike.  He saidhe would be happy to do it, but he won't. W hy?
 
Because inEuropeancities you live in apartm ent buildings. T he topf loorof a large building 

and youhad to go get the bike down the stairs, out tothe park, ride the bike and 
c ome  ba ck .   

He said that he couldm anage, but riding thebike with the yellow star m ade us a target.  Again, 

nobody want thebike,nobody wants anything except to whack you on the head. T hat didn't 

happen.  
 
But inorder to avoid the possibility he m ade certain Ididn't have the bike.  I can tell you that in 

1949 when we came to this country, ver y qui ckly af ter we settled inNew York my m other and 

father said we're going to a departm ent store.
 
W hy? T hey wantedtobuy m ea bike.  Ialsowant to add to that, that as this bikebusiness 

happened to begin, Ibegan to understandthe yellow star was not a m arkof  distinction, but a 

ta rge t.
 

I said that the war was m uch more prevalent in our lives than the Holocaust.  Yet in1941, in 

winter '41.  I was 5and a half
 
years old.T hatwas m y f irst experience in Holocaust related 
m atters.  I'm  going to tell you that very quickl y.
 
W etooka trainf rom  Budapest south to m y mother'shom e town in Yugoslavia to visit with m y 

grandparents andher two sisters. W e spenta couple days.
 
I do remember thatonone of thedays m y uncle took me to his place of  work, which is a cork 

factory.  He owneda cork factory.  Ihave no recollection what I saw there, but I know it was  

cork and I know I was there.
 
Second orthird day in the m orning, 7:30 or so, som ebody was com ing up theelevator andsaid 

that something funky was going on inthe street.
 

 
5
 
Five m inutes later two policeman come up and knock on the door. As I rem ember rather 
nicely, say to us, ladies and gentlem en, youneed to 
--
 
th
is is wintertim e.  It's not bitter and 
terrible, but it's winter.  You need to com e outside. W ehave to conduct a census.  
 
W hich seem ed odd,though you needtounderstand, we do a census every ten years.  T he 

Nazis did oneevery 20 m inutes.
 
Because they believed that if  you knew where people were, you could control their 

m ovements.  OK.  Sowe get dressed go outside to the street and told to turn lef tand walk in 

thatdirection.  No idea wh y there would be acensus. W e walkedf or som e time.  My m other 

ca
rried me.  My fathercarried me.  I'm 5 anda half years old. A little guy.
 
W earrived at aplace I recognized. W hy? Them ain street was over here, the sidewalk was 

over here and we were on the sidewalk andon our left were these 8
-
foot fence.
 
In European cities thatare not on the lakes oron theocean or the seas, but on the river, they 

m ake abeach outof  the area by the river, and thisparticular placeon the Danube River was a 

beautif ul beach in thesumm ertim e with hot pools and cold pools and wave pools and 

am usem ent parkand restaurantand all kinds of  things that were great.  
 
I had been there probably in August of the sam e year. In thethreeorf our monthsI guessI 

hadforgotten.  I had no idea why, there wasn't anybody else.W e were marching long this 

stockadefence towards theopen gates towards the beach area which are wide open.  People 

go down thereand make a left turn and go towards the beach itself ,which is m aybe 300 or 

400 yards away.
 
W e were beginning toapproach these gatesanda policeman was standing on the right and 

said to m yf ather," Mister, what are you doinghere?"   My father saidI'm  here visiting the 

f a m ily.   
 

T hat's no problem  to me.  T he problem  is you're here with a group of people who I know are 

n o tf rom th is city.  If  y
ou're counted in the census, that will m ess up the numbers.W e can't 
have that.  Stand aside.  My f ather askedhim how did you know.  
 
Because I'm  af oot policeman andthe crossroads andblock of the streetfrom your house, I 

have seen you many tim es walking here, grocery store, your off ice,whatever.  I recognize you.  

You didn't recognize me, I canunderstand that.  Stand aside. W ithin m inutes of  the standing 

aside,the uniform ed officer comes and stepsoutand talks to hisbuddiesand gets on thebull 

horn and says ladies and gentlemen,the requirem ents of the census have beenm et.  Go 

home.
 
Matter off act, you can stopat the schoolover there, and have coffee and hot chocolate. W e 

weren't interested.  My father hailed a cab.  First call camef rom m y aunt.  Oneof  the sisters 

called, where were you on that call? W estill hadphones in thosedays.  She said at 7:30 in 

them orning two policem en cam eby with a census. Before they lef t,she offered them  whatm y 

aunt would do.  
 
I'm  rem indedthat m y aunt's son and wife were in the audience several years ago here,and 

unf ortunately he died earlier this year in Israel. T he point is when she offeredhim coffeeand 

cake, there were 17 cakes, 14 coffees, andaroom full of dishes. T hese guys hadthebest 

poss
iblebreakfast, coffee of their life.
 
As these callsbeganto com e in, we beganto get calls explainingwhat happened.
 
Partisan groupsf or groups thatattempted to in som e way slow do wn the Nazi forces. They 

would bomb a truck orexplode atrainor some rails or som ething like that. To give them som e 

kind of grief , whatever they could.  Som ething like this happened in the general vicinit y of my 

m other's home town.  
 

 
6
 
As a retaliationf or this, they m arched us outto the beach and all those people whom ade 
a l ef t  
turn towards the beach itself , where the ice was 3feet thick,had been openedby canonf ire 
that m orning.
 
T hesefolks were shot in the back, into the river, tof loat down the river to be never found or to 

befound when the water thawed out in March.  Ladiesand gentlem en, what Idescribeto you 

is a pogrom, which is a senseless, purposeless and useless exercise in saying I cando thisto 

you, and there's nothing you can do about it. My f irst experience inHolocaust.
 
>> Ho w m any were kill ed?
 
>> M a n n
y Mandel: Over 300 Jewish peopleandabout1250 all together.T hose of you who 
are going to go to museum will see the granddaddy of all pilgrim s, called a Kasztner, thenight 

of  the broken glass, which took place inGerm any.
 
>> Bill Benson: You shared with m e that early, the Hungarianshad im poseda numberof  very 

anti
-
Sem itic restrictions.  You mentioned a mom entago you still had aphoneat that time. Tell 
us about som eof  those restrictionsbesideswearing the Jewish star.
 
>> Manny Mandel: You know that Hungary had a relationship withNazi go vernm entunlike any 

other government with the exceptionof  Italy.  T hey were allies.  T hey were allies for thef irst 

W orldW ar II, which is wh y Hungar y lost territory and had som e def icits from the war.  T hey 

began 
to pass anti
-
Jewish legislation in the 20's but didn'tenforcethem  until the late '30s.  
 
As Bill said inthe introduction, '38. The yellow star was oneof  them .
 
A man comes to the door one day and says I have totake your phone. And I said why.  I don'
t 
know if  I said itor m y father.
 
>> Bill Benson: You rem em ber this yourself ?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely.  Thetelephone man came to take the phone.  My father says 

wh y?  Because there was a law passed thatJews can't have phones. T hat makesno sense to 

anybody,f ine.  My f ather says I use itform y work.  Can't do it.  Other restrictions that 

happened which Ionly know about because they didn'thappen to me.  
 
But restrictions in schooling, restrictions in work, restrictions inplaces where Jews could ho
ld  
jobs as lawyers, doctors, and Indian chief s. Thatdid notapply to a 7 or 8
-
year
-
old kid, but I 
know about it. W hatdid apply to us isfor exam ple, again, if you aresomewhatfam iliar with  lif e 

in the '30s in Europe, you know m iddle
-
c la s s  f a m ilie s  at  
the tim e would employ dom estichelp.  
 
Because we had no refrigerator. W ehad a stove, yes, gas stove.  But no refrigerator, no 

m icrowave, f reezer, none of the things that today m ake life easier. But we had amaid a young 

wom an, 18 years oldf rom the village.  She had herown room, andfacilities, herown m aids' 

quarters if you want to call it that.  
 
She was kindof m y buddy because she was the youngestthing inmy envi ronment exceptfor 

f riends ofm ine.  She was 18 and I was 8.  But she was not aparticularly educated young 

wom an.
 
But she was very nice.   One day the law came down that said shem ay not stay with us.  

Because Jews could not have dom estichelp.  She offered totake me with her toher village.  

She thought that would save m e.  My parentscho
se not to do that.  But these are the 

restrictions that came slowl y and surely.
 
My f ather's youngest brother,m y uncle David af ter whom  m y son isnamed, was a university 

student getting his doctorate in Hebrew gramm ar at the University of Budapest.  
 
I  we n
t tohis graduation with the yellow star thatboth he wore and Iwore.  And there were 
people in theaudience, I didn't know them  personally, who were there to offera certain kind of  

protection to him  in the event som ebody want to whack him  on the head.  Having the gall of 

 
7
 
being a Jew getting adoctorate. How dare you do it.
 
It didn't happen.
 
>> Bill Benson: Yourf ather was forced to goto a labor battalion.W hatdid thatm ean?
 
>> Manny Mandel:T he Hungarianm ales were conscripted into thearm y.  They f ought with the 
Nazis, and asam atter of fact there were divisions of the Hungarians f ighting in Russia onthe 

Russian invasion 
--
 
the Nazi invasion of  Russia.  Jews, tobackf ill the jobs thatm en were 
doing.  
 
Farm ing, m ining, all kinds of work, f illing holes f rom bom bings and stuff. T hey conscripted 

Jews into these labor battalions.  Andm yf ather would be called upeither by phone, orby note 

or somebody would com e to thedoorand say, 3:00 onT uesday you'll be at this train station.  

You'll be gonea day, a m onth, a year.  Undeterm ined periodof  tim e.  They would do this 

consistently alm ost, so thatf rom  1942
-
1944,we were all deported. I didn't see muchof my 
fa the r.
 

Oneof  the tim eI did see him was the discussion with thebicycle.  Oneof  the tim eshe wasn't 

there, it was perf ectly acceptabletom e andunderstandable that he wouldn't be hom e, 

because he wasn't. Obviously, it lef ta certain void in m y life.
 
And f rom  '42
-
'44, Ididn't see him  very m uch.  From  '44
-
'46 I didn't see him  at all. Butf rom 
'46 
on when he died in 1995 when he was almost 90, I saw him all the tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson: Up to the tim e that Germ ansoccupied Hungary.  Excluding that horrible 

incident you just describedfor us, you saidthat lif e was pretty muchgoing on norm ally durin
g 

th a t tim e.
 

>> Manny Mandel: For m e it certainly was, becauseI was a little kid and was protected ina 

glass bubble, as it were, by m y parents. Besides,m uch of what happened to create the 

problem  would not affect a child.  Ihad no job loss, Ihad no career loss, no school loss. 

T hose kinds of things.  I didn't have to have m y business shut down.  I didn't have to earn a 

living.  All things aff ecting adultsand restrictive laws did not happento me.
 
T he things I saw were the ideaof a child,and that's
 
a different line of  sight than adults.
 
>> Bill Benson: You also shared with m e that besides the restrictions of  the anti
-
S em it ic  it  la ws  
passed there were also the privations of war andBudapest was being bombed by the allies.
 
>> Manny Mandel: All the tim
e.
 
>> Bill Benson: Tell usabout that.
 
>> Manny Mandel:W e had air raids, sometimes twice, threetimes anight.  We were bom bed 

one sidef rom the Russians andf rom theother side,f rom the western allies.  All togetherthere 

were opportunities to be in the
 
shelters, several ties a day.  Now in som e ways, that was ve ry 
exciting, but what was notexciting was whenyou cam e out of the shelter and wept to school 

the next 
--
 
went to school, you didn't know if  the building next to you was destroyed with yo ur 
f ri e
nds in it.  It didn't happen that way to m e,butbuildings aroundthe corner were. The bom bs 
cam e and they were devastating.  Ourparticular building was not severely dam aged.  

T hroughout the war, my father went back to Hungary during the war.  My m other andI did not.  

T old us that one of theroom shad som edam age f rom bom b shrapnel.
 
>> Bill Benson: March19,1944 Nazi occupy Hungary.  Lif e changed dram atically. W hy did 

they come in so late inthe war?
 

>> Manny Mandel: In 1941, if  youf olks rem em ber some
 
of them ain characters in the Nazi 
regim e.  One was named Herm ann Goring, som etimes called Fat Herm ann. Inthef irst world 

war he created the beginning of  an Air Forcewhich became a very f earedAir Force inthe 

SecondW orldW ar.  He issued a statementtalking about thef inal solution tothe Jewish 

 
8
 
problem .  Hitler's position was to getthem out of  Germ any, get them out of  Europe, get them  
outof  the world.  
 
And Herm ann issuedthis statement.  In 1942, in Berlin, there was aconf erence where the 

actual m
echanics were put into effect of thef inal solution.T he conference was called by a 
m an of  Reinhardt, who was out of Prague.  He was assassinatedbefore the endof  the war.  
 
T hem an who m ade sure the trains went on tim e was am ain named Adolf Eichm ann.  
He  

arrived to Budapest the 19thof  March. T he reason they occupy Hungary is the issue of their 

allied shipor the alliedissue was term inated,because some of theHungarian leadershipdid 

not want to exportall the Jews.
 
T he issue was do what we say or we
 
invade,andthey did.  He arrives on the 19thof  March 
andthe deportationsf rom Budapest begin atthe rate of 12,000a day.  T hat's a lot of people.
 
>> Bill Benson: Over 400,000 within six week s.
 
>> Manny Mandel:T hey were living there, com ing toBudapest thinking it would be a safe 

place. The last place he com es tobecauseof  the allied position isHungary.
 
>> Bill Benson: You lost your grandparents early, didn't you?
 
>> Manny Mandel: My grandparents,m y m other's parent who Ihadvisited earlier.  They 
were 

all taken to Auschwit z.  And in Auschwitz, a typical kindof  selection took place.W hich said the 

old f olks 
--
 
inthe early '60s in good health and the kids. 
 
Probably in f our hours.  Thetwo aunts, wom en in their 30s, were perfectly healthy and 

su r
vi ved the war, diedaf ter the war becauseof  other kinds of causes.
 
>> Bill Benson: Tell usyour f ather was away at thistim e on labor brigade.  So you're with your 

m other. Tell us what happened with you andyour m other.
 
>> Manny Mandel: As soonas Eichm a
nn arrives, two m en f rom  a self
-
appointed rescue 
comm ittee approachhim . To approach him ,to see him was probably as easy as going to see 

thepope. Adolf Eichmann was protectedf rom  every direction andyou couldn't go in andsay I 

want to see Colonel Adolf  Eichm ann. T hey were able tof inagle their wa y in and come up with 

som e kindof deal. T his was March of  1944.  
 
Ever yone knows the Germ ans arenot winning the war exceptf or one exception. T he one 

exception was AdolphHitler, who would never concede thathe waslosing the war until hewas 

in a bunker in 1945. The Germ ans were interested in som ehow feathering their nest of what 

would happen if they win the war.
 
EichmannW as able to feather hisnest asof others,and they endup in Argentina. TheSouth
 

Am erica countries welcom ed people because their philosophy was welcom ed to Nazi position 

in life.  Andthat's where he lived.  He's beenarrestedthere, but that's anotherpart of the story 

notparticularly im portantf orus. Buthe winds up there, because of thesedeals.
 
T hesedeals goall the way Eichm ann to Himm ler, number 3 in theGerm an government and 

thehead of the SS.
 
T he concept was tomake a trade.  In Germ an they call it " bloodform aterial."  Theproposal is 

m ade that if he releases a m illion Jews f rom  the cam ps, they would supply him  with 10,000 

t ru cks.  

>> Bill Benson: And these are these two men.
 
>> Manny Mandel:W ho blastedtheir way in.  Ladies and gentlem en, he couldn't release a 

m illion people even if  he wantedto. Becausethere weren'ta
 
m illion in cam ps anym ore that 
late. They were being killed m uch too quickly.
 
10,000trucks.  Folks, they didn'thave ahubcap ora bicycle.
 
>> Bill Benson: Completely audaciousproposal.
 

 
9
 
>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely.  And everybody knew it.  T hesediscussions go on and goon 
and goonfor a while.  One of  the two men sent to Cairo to speak with the British,because 

they were the ones who were in charge of that partof  the world totalk about trucks.  He's 

arrestedas a spy.  Spendsthe rest of the war in jail.  Lives af ter the war and lives to havea 

pretty good lif eaf terwards.  No trucks.
 
T hisevolved into a group of 1700
-
and somepeople,for what we call valuables.  Not money.  
Becausem oney was useless.  Only two kinds of m oney were useful: one was the
 
pound 
sterling, theBritish money, and the Am erican dollar.  Nobody hadany ofthat. But jewelr y was 

available.  People had it.
 
T hey collectedall this into suitcases and ourgroup, and other groups like it, were these trade 

arrangem ents. A gentlem an no
 
longer with us, was known to one of our guesthere by 
Heisenberg.  By shipto Palestine, had claimed Palestinian residency having been caught by 

the war in Europe.  
 
T here were displacedpersons.  If  youbelieve that, I have severalm ore$3bills I can gi
ve  yo u .   
T he point is we were taken by train not to one of these neutralports.
 
>> Bill Benson: Beforeyou go there.T ell us, the 1700. T hat'sa small number.  How is that 

1700 number com posed?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Nobody knows.  Nobody really knows.  T he manwho was representing 

him self as this group,a Dr. Kastner was not the one who choseeverybody.  But what was 

done was the variousorganizes were gi ven allocations of percentages.
 
T he observant comm unity, the leftist, the rightist community, prof essional comm unity and so 

on were given spaces. W e were able tof ind space, I think becauseof  my f ather's positionand 

m y uncle's involvem ent in oneof  these groups.  I don't even know which one.
 
>> Bill Benson: Thetwo of youare 
--
 

>> Manny Mandel:T he three of
 
us. My uncle,m other and I.  Anda ver y distant cousin 
becam e the f ourth m em ber of  this group.  But instead of going to a neutral part, we were taken 

north to a place nobody ever heard of . It's called Bergen
-
Belsen. You do know it becausethe 
m o st fam o
us non
-
survi vor of  the war was in that camp. Anybody care to takea guess who I'm  
talking about?
 
>> Anne Frank.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Right. She was thereand that's where shedied, and that's where Ididnot 

die.
 
>> Bill Benson:W hy did you end up at Bergen
-
Belsen.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Becausethey decidedtohave a three
-
day detour which lasted six m onths. 
Because this was an additional way.  T hey were kindof a catch
-
22 boundary.
 
T hey couldn't kill us because if they killed us,they would not gettheloot. On
 
the other hand, 
they thought if  they held us longer, to get more loot. T hat's exactly what happened.
 
350people in the group were taken out of Switzerland af ter six weeks.  I was not one of them .  

Af terf ive months or so, all of us were liberated through
 
Switzerland.  Som y war and Holocaust 
issues ended inSwit zerland in December of 1944.
 
>> Bill Benson: You were in Bergen
-
Belsen for quite a period of  time.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Six m onths.
 
>> Bill Benson: Do you recall arriving there and what was it likef or
 
you to be in that inf am ous 
c a m p?
 
>> Manny Mandel:T hose of you who will go through them useum  or hadbeen through will  see 

af reight caron thethirdf loor, which is a typicalf reight car of the day. T hat's what we travel ed 

 
10
 
inf or nine days.  Supposedly to a neutral port.  Interesting when we left, again by German 
train, it was a trooptrain.  Much more comfortable,but whatever it was.
 
Bergen
-
Belsen was am ajor concentration cam pbutnot a killing cam p.  People went to work in 
Bergen
-
Belsen, but we did not, which probably saved our lives.
 
>> Bill Benson: People forcedtodo slave labor.
 
>> Manny Mandel:W hatever labor was tobedone.  It was a transitcam p, a labor camp. W e 

saw peoplem arching out to the variousf ields every day. W e werenotbecause they were 

concerned if m alnutrition or starvation or typhus, which was the disease of the day, gets us, we 

would not be availablefor trades.
 
And they knew ver y well that if  we're notavailable, they're not going to get them oney.  Sowe 

had to 
--
 
the trade h
adto produce on both sides.  Andthey could not produce dead bodies.
 
>> Bill Benson: You shared with m e that during that period,that there were attem pts to, asyou 

put it, establish some form s of norm alcy. T ell us abit about that.
 
>> Manny Mandel: People are strange. T hewi ll to live and survive i s tremendously strong.  

W ecame to cam pand all of us were told to bring certainf oodfor the journey including som e 

canned goods anda couple things. W ithin acouple weeks of  camp, businesses sprung up.  

W ha
t kind of business? W hen you f inished yourf ood, youtook the tin can, if  that was your 

area of interestandmade jewelr y out of  it.  Bracelets, rings, earrings and then traded these 

goodsf orhaircuts,becausethere was a manthere who was a barber who brought tools.  And 

he traded the haircutfor somebody to repair your shoes who thentradedf or cigarettes to get 

som ething else.
 
T his kind of trade.W e had a school, we hada synagogue, we hadbusiness going on,and I 

am  sure this was psyc hologically ver y
 
helpf ul and helpedpeople survi ve.
 
>> Bill Benson: During that tim e, did your m other have any contactwith your father 

whatsoever?  Any idea where he was and she had no idea where he was?
 

>> Manny Mandel: Hewas in geographic Hungar y throughout the tim euntil we left. About 40 

hoursf rom Budapest. Afterwards the groupwas m oved intothe Ukraine. W e had no contact 

with him , norhe with us.  Later on, whenhewas able to get backto Budapest bef orethe end 

of  the war, he was able to traceus, becausethis
 
was this special group.  He was able totrace 
us through the group. And m y m otherestablished contact with him through a colleagueof his 

in Swit zerland. W e could talkto the colleague.  He wrote tom y f ather.  My father wrote tohim .
 
>> Bill Benson: Bu
t that was la te r.
 

>> Manny Mandel:T hat was af ter the second.
 
>> Bill Benson:W hileyou were in Bergen
-
Belsen, you got very ill.  And it was actually I think 
ver y severe, but you were able to survi ve.
 
>> Manny Mandel:W ell, we had 35 doctors in the group. 
 
Butthey had nothing to work with .  I 
had some kind of double or triple pneumonia.W hich is diff icult when you only have two lungs.
 
[Laughter]
 
T here was notreatm ent availableand m y mother'sm ajor concernwas I would be taken into 

the Nazi dispensary, which thathad in the cam p.  She was concerned if  I go there, I may never 

com e back.
 
T he body's resilient.  I was a child, a strong kid and I was able to recover f rom  the infectionof  

thepneumonia.  And the only thing they could do was m ake me a little bit
 
m ore comf ortable.  
T his was them ethodof  palliative medicine, which Idon't know if you've heard of or saw.  
 
You m ay have hearddepending how old youare or where you grew up. Burlap was soaked in 

m ustard seedand put the whole thing over yo ur chest.  T he effect was like Ben Gay or Vicks.  

 
11
 
It can't curethe pneumonia,but it can make youm ore comfortable when you'rebreathing.
 
>> Bill Benson: December 1944, af ter six m onths in Bergen
-
Belsen,you leave Bergen
-
Belsen 
for Switzer land. Tell us what happene
d f rom there.
 
>> Manny Mandel:W ell we leave by Germ antroop train and were taken into Switzerland and 
the Swiss being as good as they are and asm eticulousas they are. T hey put us in the 

gym nasium  of the school andfum igatedus so we don'tbring bugs into Switzerland. T hey' re 

ver y clean.  From  there, to a very lovel y part of  French Switzerland which was a beautiful 

resort hotel takenover by the Red Cross where we spent a couple weeks eating potatoes.W e 

were not em aciated, but we were hungry.  T hey se
nt us all kind of  fattening m aterial.  
 

T hey were able tof ind an arrangem ent whereby, 20 Hungarian kids,I being one of  them  were 

sent to a kindof boarding school ina part of Swit zerland.  I spentm y time there until we went 

off  to go to Palestine in Au
gu s t  of  19 4 5.
 
>> Bill Benson: Manny, do you recall when the train crossedtheborder into neutral 

Swit zerland, do you recall theemotions of the adults andother around you?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Allof  ushad a sim ilar emotion, because what happened, apparentl
y t h e  
Germ an trains could not run in Switzerland. T he Swiss being as neat asthey are,made their 

gauge of  the railroad, the width of the railroad line different than theGerman gauge. So you 

can't invade Switzerland by train. W epulled on one side of the platform  with the German 

trains. T hese were Germ an troop trains which were notf irst class.
 
And then these lit, beautif ul warm , hot chocolate
-
laden Swiss trainswhich we were transferred 
to. And then light and warm th and what the trains brought usand
 
then went to our destination.
 
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if  there was any fear thatneutral Switze rlandmight beattacked 

by the Germ ans?
 

>> Manny Mandel:T here hadn't in in400 years so we felt OK.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: So your father isnot with you while that's going on.He's in Budapest.T ell us 

what he was doing that tim e.
 
>> Manny Mandel: My father toldus thathe was with a group of people, hisparticularplatoon 

or whatever it is.  Or military or ganized groups.  And at som epoint in the Ukraine sometime in 

thefall of  '44before the end of the war, when theGermans were going backwards.  
 
T hey were retreating.  He and 20 or 25 of hisbuddies decided you know what we should do?  

W a lk  awa y .
 
Not escape. T hey wer e not chained in any way.  T hey did. T hey walkedaway back to 

Budapest, several hundred kilom eters. T hey walked in thenighttime. T hey slept in the 

daytim e. They stolefood wherever they could. T hey cooked certain things by the exhaust of  

trucks.  T he heat f rom the exhaust of  trucks
. And it was back in Budapest before the Russians 
cam e in.  
 
My f ather, being a native Hungarian and spoke Hungarianas a native got oneof  those 

peasant jackets, with a big handle
-
barm ustache and round f ace hewould passf or Hungarian 
andbecame a runnerbetween the various saf ehouses inBudapest. T he Swedish hadasaf e 

house with RaoulW allenberg as its chief person.  He was there, he survi ved thebesthe could. 

Until the Russians came in January of  '45.
 
>> Bill Benson: He was working as part of  the 
underground.
 
>> Manny Mandel: At thatpoint it was theO
verground.
 
>> Bill Benson: OK.
 
>> Manny Mandel: But he was there until January when the Russians came when Hungary 

 
12
 
was liberated, liberated by becom ing a comm unist place. Butona short
-
t e rm  ba s is  it
 
wa s  
better because nobody was hunting Jews and killing them on the street.
 
>> Bill Benson:W henthe war f inally ends inMay of  1945, yourf ather is still in Budapest,but 
he's been able to establish contact with you. Andhe wants youto com e back toBuda
pe s t .
 
>> Manny Mandel: Hesays his job is safe, the apartment is saf e, his income is safe. My 

m other said she would never setfoot in Hungary again.  She would go back to Yugoslavia.  I 

did.  My wif e and I went backa couple times. W e visited our house13, on a streetthat you 

can can't pronounce.
 
>> Bill Benson: And your m om never went back?
 

>> Manny Mandel: No.
 
>> Bill Benson:W hatdid your father do then?
 
>> Manny Mandel: My father then was involve d in organizing peoplethat were going tofollow 

u s.   A
ndtom ake the story a little shorter,because it'sa long story, he became part of the 
illegal im m igration to Palestine af ter the British has donetheborders and eventually got there 

in 1946.
 
>> Bill Benson: Takea m inute to describehow he did that. It's a rem arkable story.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Heand a groupof peoplef rom  Budapest essentially m arched f rom  

Hungary down to Italy.  They all claim ed to have been survi vors of  the war and all were 

damagedby the war and all were bothdeaf and dumb.  
 
T hey could
 
not speaknor hear. T hey did this becausethey didn't wantanyoneto know that 
m ostdidnot speak the language of the country they were in whether it's Yugoslavia or parts of  

Austria or parts of  Italy.
 
T hey got to aplace in Italy which is notfarf rom  a
 
place you may have heard of called Pisa.  A 
sm all village called LaStatjia. 
 
T he Israeli underground provided them  a boat where 1100 people borderedand sailedto 

Palestine. They sailed in the morning, but one m ileout two destroyers, British destroyers were 

standing like this. They stopped sailing.  From  that report,the British would not letthem  

through. They decided to do them ost thing they could do to illustrate their positionand went 

for a hunger strike.
 
T here was a hunger strike organized by PaulNum en.  He was not in Latvia.
 
T here was a British
-
Jewish m inister in Milan in Italy who heard of this and went down totalk to 
them  and they m adeadeal.  If  they stop the hunger strike, becauseEngland couldn't accept 

thefact that 1100or so people would die on the banksof  the Mediterranean, having comeout 

of  concentration cam ps and now they're going to perishf rom  starvation. They couldn't do that. 

So they would sendthem  to Palestine ina secondboat and they went direct.  In the '40s as m y 

fa t
her arrived.  My f ather and I andhe reunited.
 
>> Bill Benson: How m any of yourf am ily wer e murdered during theHolocaust?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Ihave no num bers but Ihadf our grandparents. One I didn't know he died 

bef ore I was bornfor other reasonsbut threeof  them,m y cousins,uncles, aunts, other cousins 

andother various members of thef am ily.  I can't count,but abunch.
 
>> Bill Benson: Any other survive?
 
>> Manny Mandel:W ell, yes two aunts survivedm y uncle who was with us survived.  Another 

uncle was draf ted intothe Yugoslavia arm y. Spent the rest of the tim e in Italy as a prisoner of  

war.  But he was draf ted.  Yugoslavia draf tedyou, Hungarians did not.
 
Some survived and som e did not.
 
>> Bill Benson:W ehave tim e to take a couple of  questionsf rom our audience.  You gam e?
 

 
13
 
>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely.
 
>> Bill Benson:W hatwe would like you todo if  you have a question is wait until you have a 
m icrophone. W ehave one coming down each aisle.W hen you have the m icrophonemake 

your question, if  you can,as brief as you can.  
 
I'll repeat it justto make sure that we hear it correctly and then Manny wil l respondto your 

question. Anybody have a question?  And if not,I have m any m ore.  Though we'll run outof  

tim ebefore I get toall of  those.
 
W h il e  w
e're waiting to see if anybody wants to aska question.  Manny, you hada career as a 

psychotherapist later in life.  Do you think that what you went through in your early years as a 

child, all that you went through anddescribedfor us. Did that inf luenc
e your choice to becom e 
a psychotherapist in any way?
 
>> Manny Mandel: I've been askedthat question many tim es and I've thoughtabout it.  I can 

nut give you a direct connection, but it's clear tom e, that human services, which is what I did in 

a sense, to som e degree cam e out of the experience I had as a child.  I can't connectthedots 

clearly, but I'm surethey connect.
 
>> I just want to thank you for sharing your story and ask you,having beenthroughthat 

experience andhaving grown up observant,how,
 
once yourf am ily r eunited inPalestine, how 
did the experience impact the observance in thefaceof  yourf am ily.  Andothers who you 

arrived there with.
 
>> Bill Benson: Did you f ollow that?
 
>> Manny Mandel: Ido.  The question is and thenthere's a questionagain that's asked. Did 

m y senseof  Jewish com m itm ent changebecauseof  whathappened.  People askthe question 

andexpand it to say how could God have done that.  My particularexperience was that my lif e 

continuedaf ter the war as it did bef ore, because m yf ather was the head of  thefam ily.  A 

reserved m an professionally andprivately, and it continued.  
 
Asf ar as the relationship of  Godand why God coulddothis, I can't speakto it.  Idon't 

understand what God does because he doesn't talk to me.  
It's well beyondm y ability to 
understand why did this happen.  
 
And I'm not willing to m ake a statementthatsays because it happened, God is bad, so Idon't 

like him anym ore.  Som eof m y colleagues who are survi vors, have disbelief  in God because of  

what
 
happened. I don't understandhow you can perm it it, but if  I don't understand, I can't 
blame f or it.
 
>> Bill Benson: Thankyou.  Any other questions?  I think we'll go aheadand closeour 

program  then.  Pleasestay with usf ora couple morem inutes because to closeour program  

we're going to hearf rom  Manny to close theprogram . Before we do that, I want tothankyou 

all for being with us.  We'll have two more program s next week and we'll end our program for 

2017, but we'll resume again in Marchof 2018 in them useum 's website will have inf ormation 

about that.
 
For anybody who hasanother question you have thought about, Manny wi ll remain behindon 

the stagef ora while.  W einvite you to com eup here to aska question or just shakehis hand 

or gi ve him  a hug. W hatever you want to do.W e welcome you to com e up here and do 

exactly that.
 
It is ourtradition thatour First Personhasthe last word. Manny, please share your thoughts to 

close today's program .
 
So with that, Manny.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Billtells m e
 
this is thetenth time I've done First Person andthe sixth time 

 
14
 
I've done it with Bill's I was thinking about what I would want to say to you asa concluding 
comm ent. W hat I want to do is I wantto challenge you with something.  If ound working 

through 
them useum  andm y own involvem ent thatm ostof us havea very l im ited knowledge 
of  history.  And I would like to challenge you to createm orehistory in your own fam ily.  
 
I want to challenge you to do that which was suggested at one pointby a m an whose w
ords 
you know but whose nam e you don't. 
 
You rem em ber the words that those of us who don't learn history well are doomed to repeat it.  

T hat was said some 100 years ago. I wouldlove to go tothe Library of  Congress and take out 

a disk of som e sort and have som eonef rom  the CivilW ar,the 
R
evolutionary 
W
artalk to me 
live.  It's im possible becausethe technology was not available. It is today.  AndIf ind thatver y 

disheartening, how m any f olksdon't know where their parents were born, where their parent
s 
went to school, who their grand 
--
 
not who their grandparents were, but where they'ref rom, 
what part of their states, what partof  them oon.  AndI would like tochallenge you all to go 

home and get yourselfa recording device of  som e sort, including the telephone, which is OK 

for som e things.  Andget thehistory of  yourfam ilies recorded so you can share it with the 

future.  Please do that.
 
>> Bill Benson: Thankyou.
 
[Applause]
