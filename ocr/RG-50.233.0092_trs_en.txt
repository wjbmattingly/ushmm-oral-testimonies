Abraham M orgenstern was born to Russian Je
wi sh parents who had mo ved to Lublin, 
Poland around 1921. He was reared in a cont
emporary religious fa mily, and attended 
Polish public school and a Jewish school. He gr
aduated from business school at 16 just 
before war broke out in 1939. That year , the Russians took over his town, which 

protected them for a short time .  

 

After the Germans invaded Poland, they shot
 about 99 percent, some  150 of Lublin™s 
best- educated, professional Jews.  

 

Abe asserts that no Jews in Lublin tried to 
escape. Lublin™s two ghettos were established 
on April 1, 1942, and the Morgensterns were 
moved into one of them that month. Food 
became very scarce.  

 

Abe™ father and sister perished during the 
first of four actions. Abe says that no Jews 
from his area were taken to concentration camps; they were shot in the woods and put 

into mass graves.  

 

Abe does not provide ma ny details about how he
 and his mother survived, except to say 
that she bribed some  people. He refers th
e interviewer to an u
nname d book he wrote. 
 
Abe me ntions labor camps, one in Kami
onka. One was burned down, killing the camp 
inmates. Abe reported a few times to the Judenr
at, which took him to wor k temporarily at 
a factory and then at a camp. But eventu
ally, he says, ﬁI just stayed home.ﬂ 
  

Toward the end of the war, Abe and eight ot
hers dug a hole where th
ey hid until Russian 
troops found them; about two weeks after th
e Russians had liberated the area.  
 

After the war, he and his mother immi grated 
to Italy. They had pla
nned to go to Palestine 
where they had relatives, but did not go becau
se they did not know the relatives™ name s 
or addresses. 

 

Abe says that of Lublin™s estimated 10,000 
Jews, only about 200 survived -- 50 or 60 in 
the city, and about 150 who had escaped to Russia. 
 

 
Interview with Abraham Morgenstern Transcript 
 
A: The mi nute they came to that city goingto Poland already in
 1921, I think that™s 
where they smuggled the border from Russia to Poland and my father me t quite a 

few people that he knew from before thatalready came ahead of hi m to that city, 

and he found some  cous ins and whatever.  He also, I guess, wa s offered a 
position, a good position.  He ma naged a fl
ourmill, and my mother got pregnant 
and so there was an excuse not to go.  
Then when I came already, my father didn™t 
feel like leaving. He was a li
ttle established already a
nd he felt good there. He had 
a lot of people that he knew and it was 
a nice town, a religious town and that™s 
how we stuck there.  
 

Q: Was your family observant, religious?    

 

A: 99% of the Jewish people were orthodox. 
 There was no other s
ection that didn™t, 
only orthodox.  Some  were modern, some  we
re old-time  religious but my father 
had no beard and he was --. In that mill, 
as I say, later when I was growing up, he 
was traveling to villages 
and little towns buying grains 
from the peasants.  Then 
he was giving them to the casino and that™s
 how he ma de his living at that time.  I 
went to public school and in
 the afternoon I went to cheder which was a Jewish 
school.  Then later on when I was like 
11, 12, 13, I went to Hebrew School in the 
afternoon for two, three years.  We  learne
d other subjects too beside Hebrew.  
 

Q: You went to that school solely, you 
didn™t go to the public school any mo re? 

 

A: Yes, yes.  I sa id I went to the public
 sc hool till I was 13 and finished.  Up there 
you go seven years public school.  I fini
shed public school in 1936.  There were 
two higher schools after that.  One was 
the gymnasium they called it which was 
run by the state, and the other one wa s busin
ess school. It was also
 -- it wasn™t run 
by the state, it was private but they we re
 on the same  level.  You had to wear 
uniforms and you had to get exams before
 being admitted.  I went three years 
there and I graduated in 1939.  There, besi
des all the other su
bjects, you learned -- 
they also taught me  Ger man.  I took German language.  You could take French or 

German.  I choose German so I™m fa miliar with the German language too. 
 

Q: What did you speak in your home?  

 

A: Polish. 

 

Q: Polish?  

 

A: Yes.  I didn™t learn Yiddish till almos t
 the wartime.  I knew it from the people 
speaking all around but I never spoke it and all my friends, we always spoke 

Polish with all my fr iends.  In the cheder
, what we went when I was small yet, I 
could speak to the teacher in Yiddish that
 time but we never spoke --.  As a ma tter 
of fact my parents in th
e beginning, even later, they spoke Russian between 
themselves too because they were from Russia.  But my mother wanted me  to 

know the Polish language so she spok
e Polish to me  and my sister. 
 

Q: You had just one sister? 

 

A: Yes, one sister, two years younger, yes. 
 As I said, you asked me  about religious; 
my father traveled most of the week, he was in other towns but he ma ke sure he 
come s back Friday afternoon to ma ke Sh
abbos home  and he went to the shul 
Saturday.  He  took me  most of the tim
e to shul, I reme mber, and holidays no 
question about it.  On a Sa turday most of the business people were Jews in the 

city.  Very fe w gentiles had businesses, some  ha d but the ma jority was Jewish.  

Come  Saturday, the stores were closed up. 
 It ma y be singles, Jewish stores, they 
were open like candy stores, or a drugstore 
or some thing like that.  The rest was 
shut up completely. Some were open Sunda
ys; they allowed some  stores to be 

opened Sundays, holidays and Saturdays ev
erybody closed.  Even the people that 
only went to the synagogue on Yom Ki
ppur and Rosh Hashanah, they still 
observed the holidays. 
 

Q: Did you live right in the 
city, right in the town? 
 

A: We lived in quite a few places.  Me a
nd my fa mi ly didn™t own a house so we had -
- we™re renters.  I guess we rented wh
erever was convenient,
 wherever the job 
was.  Then when I guess they wanted more money or whatever, the family wanted 

a bigger place, we had to move.  I re
me mber mo ving like three or four times, 
different places.  From one end of the c
ity to the mi ddle city, to the outskirts, 
whatever. 
 

Q: I see.  Did your mother work? 

 

A: No.  Wo me n didn™t work before. 
 My mother always stayed home . 
 
Q: Did you ever work with your father
 at all?   Did you ever --?  
 
A: He used to take me  sometimes on a trip.  My father used to own one of these 
horse and carriages like you see in Ce nt
ral Park or some thing like that for 
pleasure.  He used to keep it at some body™
s stable but when he went out of town 
he used to go with -- he used to rent a 
drive of it with a horse and carriage that 
you could bring the grain back on that.  It
 was like a commerc i al type horse and 
buggy, not a pleasure.  As far as taking me
, he™d take me  -- most of the time he 
would take me -- he went to a pl ace where 
we had some  kind of relations, distant, 

whatever, my father knew.  He woul d leave me  there for the day, with his 

business and I would be there with other youngsters for me .  Distant, distant 

relatives or acquaintances 
whatever.  As far as working, I did not work but upon 
the gradua tion of the business sc hool in 1939, my father took me  to that flourmill 

where he used to ma nage before  Even though he was out already, ma ybe  ten 

years out of that pl ace, no not ten years, ma ybe seven or so, he  took me  to the 

office there.  He knew the people, the acc
ountants in the office and the ma nagers 
and they interviewed me  and they gave me  a test and they hired me  as of the first 

of Septembe r.  I had a position in th
e bookkeeper™s office there.  I was very 
happy, I didn™t have to -- in other words 
I got it through my father.  I didn™t get it 

on my own because I was green
 at that time , 16 years. 

 
Q: Was this a Jewish fi rm? 

 

A: Yes, yes.  It was a big mill, a very 
large mill, exported flour all over the world.  
There were two mills in the city, both Je
wish, diffe rent ends of the town.  The 
mills are ther e today, they™re there today, the mills are there. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yeah, of course, sure.  Th
ey employed a lot of people. 
 

Q: At this point, your father was more 
of an independent?   He was more of a  
merchant, a grain merchant? 
 

A: He was self-employed.  When he left  -- the reason he left  the mill there, it was 
sold.  The people that they sold the mill, the owners came from Lvov, you™re 

fa miliar with this city, pr obably you™ve re
ad about it, it was a big city in the 
Ukraine.  So the new owners came and I 
don™t know whether they let him go or it 
was -- I don™t know the details, I never aske
d.  But since then he
 didn™t work there 
but he was very friendly with the people
, even with the new owners.  The people, 

they sold the mill, opened up a new one at the othe r end of the town, some how.  

They built a new one or they built and then they sold it, whatever it was, I don™t 

know. He knew the people there and that™s
 how he got me  the job.  Of course, I 
never got the chance to put in one day™s wo
rk because the first of September I had 
to report, that™s when it happened. 
 
Q: Right, right.  What happe
ned on that day in your town? 
 
A: In our town, what it happened they -- 
the day before they proclaimed a general 
mobilization.  It was very touch-and-go for the last few weeks there before that 

date.  It was the German propaganda
 and Hitler™s speeches, you know, was 
broadcast all over.  They dema nded Danzig, it
™s a port city ther e. 
 They gave in to 
this and he dema nded some thing else afte
r that.  They knew that they cannot get 
out of it, he™s going to attack sooner or la
ter.  The mi nute that they declared the 
mobilization, it was a Friday night or  some
thing, the next day or so they declared 

war.  Germany declared, they attack
ed first and then they declared. 
 

Q: During the mobilization, what
 did they expect from everybody? 
 

A: The people had to report to their points.
  Whoever was 21 years old had to report, 
mobilize.  There was a general mobili
zation and all doctors, dentists were 
mobilized and put into uniform right away 
and sent to different parts of Poland.  
They did it quick but our city was not -- wa
s at the other end -- was at the eastern 
end of Poland.  So it was not attacked, was not attacked by the Germans, t hey 

concentrated a little bit the other way, the 
western part, that™s where they attacked 
from, the western part.  It dragged on 
like this for about two weeks.  People 

started to evacuate from Warsaw and Lodz 
(? ) and different cities.  We  us ed to 
see a lot of cars comi ng through with 
people in it.  On ______ top of the 
Roma nian border.  We  were very close 
to the Romanian and Russian border, was 

like 30 kilome ters or some thing to the 
Roma nian border, or 35, just nothing.  
They all had cars, most of them with car
s, people, not only Polish people, Jewish 
people too, they had me a ns and they didn™
t want to be caught.  They figured 
they™ll go to Romania and Romania was i
ndependent and from there they would -
-.  Actually, they did and people that
 went to Roma nia, they wound up in 
England.  All the Polish escapees wound up in England. 
 

Q: It was the wa y to go, even 
to Palestine, that route. 

 

A: To Palestine, you couldn™t go beca
use the British wouldn™t let them go. 
 

Q: The ma ndat e  had --? 

 

A: They wouldn™t let go but the English 
governme nt would let the Polish people 
come  into England.  They went -- it™s
 a long way around but that™s how they 
managed. 
 

Q: Did your father ever think about leaving? 

 

A: No, at that time , why?  Where would we
 go?   First of all, we had no means  of 
transportation, where you going to go.  It wa
s a city of nine to ten thousand Jews 

and nobody tried to escape, actually nobody. 
 Some  Polish people did, officers 
evacuated so me fa milies and police, almost to the last  day, the police, the fi remen, 
they stayed will the last  day.  Almost 
the last day, they evacuated.  What 
happened between those two weeks, 
it took about two 
weeks till the 17
th
 of 
September; it was a Sunday morning a
nd Germany was successful in occupying 
already quite a bit of -- most of -- about
 two-thirds of Pola
nd.  I think the only 
place that st ill was not occupied was Wa
rsaw.  They last ed almost a mont h.  
Some body, I guess rumo rs started to fly 
or some body knew already, they said 
within a few hours the Russian army is going 
to be here.  It didn™t take long, an 
hour or two and we heard shelling or so
me thing.  They were going, the Russian 

army was advancing and just shooting so 
that the people don™t attack them.  They 
didn™t know who the Polish army is still th
ere or the police, they had no idea.  
They were just like shelling like over the 
cities to announce that
 they are here.  
Whoever didn™t escape yet from the governme
nt tried to get out.  But there was no 
fighting, there was no dama ge.  It was very
 festive when they actually showed up.  
Their tanks and the artillery, the cavalry
; actually the whole 
town went out to 
greet them in the streets, special there 
was a lot of -- not only Jewish people but 
some  Poles too that they were socialists
 or communists or whatever.  There was 
no communist Party, it wa s illegal but there 
were people that be
lieve in socialism 
and they were the first ones to greet the 
soldiers and run thecity right from the 
beginning. 
 

Q: I™m sure your father and mother weren™t among them?  
 

A: No, no.  My father never mi xed in po
litics.  That™s how it started.  Once the 
Russians went by -- they went by and the ne
xt day they send in people to run the 
city.  The ma yor became one of the -- our 
own people sitting in jail in the other 
part of Poland, in the north some where be
longing to the communist party.  They 
came back, they let out the prisons from there.  They came back to the city, one of 

them beca me a ma yor.  He rode a horse 
and became  a ma yor.  They figured he 
was a ma n t hat was way back, a card me mber, 
he sat in jail.  So they gave him the 
honor of being a ma yor but not for long, a w
eek or two, then they appointed their 
own; they brought in their own people to ma nage the city.  A little bit later, they 

brought their fa milies and they took overthe buildings where the Polish officers 

used to live with thei r families which was evacuated al ready and they settled 

there.  Later on they even took over Je
wish apartments and they settled the 
Russians and things like that.  They 
nationalized the buildings and everything. 
 

Q: What was the first effect
 on your fa mily or yourself? 
 

A: Well the effect was positive.  First of all, my parents come  from Russia and with 
the Russian army, they could communicate and then they st arted to organize 

different businesses, everything under th
e governme nt control.  They were 
looking for anybody with ma nagerial experience and my father was pulled in right 

away in a good position. 
 

Q: He had experience and he could speak Russian? 

 
A: Experience and he went in
to a gr ain concern that the 
Ukrainians had established.  
A grain concern and they knew about hi
m and they took him in to ma nage a 
certain thing. Then he took me  into the o
ffice and that™s how I got a job.  I worked 
there almost two years in the bookkeeping departme nt. 
 
Q: Was that also a positive experience? 

 

A: Yes, very positive because they trea
ted the Jews very nicely.  You know the 
Russian authorities at that time , mos t  of
 the occupiers. The officers, the big and 
even the private people that were brought
 in, a big ma jority we re Jewish people  
from Russia.  It was a very positive th
ing for the Jewish people. It was very 
positive for the Ukrainian but it was not so positive for the Poles.  Poles were 

looked a little bit down because the Russian
s said that they came to liberate us 
from the Polish yoke or whatever.  So th
e Poles had a difficulty of getting a good 
position.  Also then a couple of mont hs la
ter, they established everybody from 16 
years and a half had to get a passport, th
e Russian passports with pictures.  We  
had to go to register.  People went to 
register according to 
their professions, 
whatever they did.  If anybody owned a 
business before, they ma rked on the 
passport that this ma n is a businessman or if he had a son over 16, the son would 

be ma rked son of a businessman.  W
ith that passport you couldn™t land a good 

position already because you were consider
ed a capitalist. That™s how they 
ma rked the passports.  Also you had to
 put your nationality, Jew, Pole or 
Ukrainian  They had in their passports what it was, even till today.  All my fr iends 

that their parents were in business and th
ey had problems getting jobs.  Being that 
my father was not ma rked as a businessman on his passport, he was, through him 

I was able to get in a few of my
 friends to that concern too. 
 

Q: Do you remember anything about be
ing indoctrinated about communis m? 
 

A: Oh yes, sure, of course.  They had lect
ures, public lecture forums  that you go.  At 
that time already it was a few months after 
they established already thei r rule.  As 
a ma tter of fact, they have 
it in the book.  One of the lectures that I reme mber, we 
worked in the grain concern.  Most of th
e grains were being shipped to Ge rmany.  
At that time already, Germany took two-thir
ds of Poland and they took one-third.  
They divided between themselves.  But at
 that time already there was a little 
friction between both of them some how.  
There were not such good relations and 
yet they were shipping all the grains out 
to them.  I reme mber asking that question 

to one of the officers that was giving th
e lecture.  They had special propaganda 
me n that worked in uniform and they were
 lectur ers, special lectur es.  I asked 
him, how could we ship to them the grains
 that being they™re already tryi ng to tell 
us that they™re not friends, they™re like 
enemies.  They™re trying to build up their 
thing against us or whatever.  He says, no we have to buy time and the amounts 

that we give them are negligible but from
 our concern most of them went there.  
He says we have to buy time to be prep
ared.  They were preparing the building 
airfield outside the city. 
 
Q: The Russians were? 
 

A: Yeah.  The Russians were.  I was roped in
 to go to that airfield on my va cation to 
work there. 
 

Q: What was the feeling in the town at that 
time ?   Was it that things are stable or --? 
 

A: It was a stable feeling, it was stable. 
 They opened up a Jewish gymnasium what it 
wasn™t before.  Before it was like a pub
lic; they opened up a separate Jewish 
gymnasium with Jewish language, He brew, 
Jewish and most of the Jewish kids 
that want to go to a gymnasium would go 
into that gymnasium.  The Poles already 
had no gymnasium no more.  The Ukra
inians did have their Ukrainian 
gymnasium,  the Poles had no gymnasium.  That™s how they were treated. 
 

Q: Really lost those --? 

 

A: Yes, they were really mad at the Pole
s.  Didn™t let us forget; they thought that 
because the Jews were more favored than 
them, they thought that they ha d to pay 
us back later.  It™s one of the reasons th
ey claime d that we were patsies with the 
Russians and most we are communi sts. 

 
Q: What about when you had 
to go build the airfield? 
 

A: Well, it happened already very close to 
the June  ™41 when Russia was attacked.  I 
had my vaca tion in May. 
 

Q: You thought, you had your vacation! 

 

A: I thought, right.  I had a vacation in 1940, 
I had one vacation for two weeks.  But 
in 1941, I was scheduled to go to a --.  Th
ey had special places where they sent 
people that worked nice in the offices,
 they worked good and they deserved a 
little break, they would send them paid vaca
tions to a place where it™s like a resort 
area.  I was scheduled to go on my two week
s to that resort area.  Here like a 
week before it, a week before my va ca
tion, I was called into the office of the 
director and he said, he says, I know that
 you must realize that how we are trying 
up an army and we have to get pr epared because the Germans keep saying they™re 

going to attack us and they built up a very big mi ght against us.  Everybody has to 

sacrifice and being I™m a good citizen or whatever, each office has to concentrate 

to the building of the airfield.  Being 
that they cannot spare nobody from the 
office because it™s a busy concern when my vaca tion come s up, that I should 

volunteer to g to that airfield.  He says
 you™re going to get paid for your vacation, 
you™re going to get paid for there.  But this
 was like six or seven kilome ters out of 
the city with no transpor tation but 
I had no choice. You couldn™t say no. 
 

Q: No choice but to volunteer? 

 
A: Right, no choice but to volunteer.  Otherw
ise I™d be fired or 
whatever and I went 
there to the airfield 
place.  They interviewed me  and they said okay, whatever that 
day was.  Next Monday you™re starting, ha
ve to be there six o™clock in the 
morning.  It was, I don™t reme mber how I 
got there the first day, I really don™t 
reme mber.  My father had somebody drive 
me  most of the time .  I know I walked 
one time.  I walked.  They took me  up there and they had mobilized all the 
peasants from the vicini ty, all around from that area, mobilized under duress.  

Otherwise they didn™t get even paid.  Whoever had a horse and buggy was 

mobilized and they had to transport all kinds of ma te
rials from the warehouses 
and back to that pl ace where they™re build
ing the airport.  They had engineers, 
they had a lot of Russians and they were
 walking on the ground and it wa s just a 
big, big field, a tremendous field.  From sc
ratch they had to stop and build that 
airport. I was there two 
weeks and I think the sec
ond or the third day, I got 
acquainted with a Russian fe llow that he 
was in the Russian army but he was in 

civilian clothes.  He was some thing, a de
molition expert or  whatever and he was 
working underground some thing.  He had a tr
uck, he was driving a truck, they run 
the little trucks or some thing  We  got ac
quainted and he says; 
I said I would like -
-.  I walked home, that™s what it was, the fi rst day I walked home.  Quite a bit to 

walk, an hour and a half or whatever I don™
t remember, an hour or more.  He said 
-- I invited him. If you want to come  to
 the house, you can have supper with us, 

figured he™ll give me  a ride which he 
did.  I says you come  to the house and you 
can even stay there overnight.  
In the morning you™ll come  ba ck. 
 
Q: You™re still living with
 your parents and sister? 
 

A: Yes, yes.  Unannounced he brought me  ho
me.  I introduced him and he was a nice 
fellow.  He had supper with us and he sl
ept one night and in 
the morning, he went 
back with the truck. That™s how we were 
going every day.  So it 
turned out to be 
not bad for me ; you know I had transportati
on.  Otherwise, I probably wouldn™t be 
comi ng home every day, I™d probably sleep
 there some where.  The two weeks 
went by, two weeks went up.  I went b
ack and some body else™s vacation came  up 
and they sent him.  
 

Q: What did you do at the airfield?  Wa s it labor? 

 

A: No, no.  It was office work.  What I act
ually did, the peasants were hauling sand.  
From wherever they were bringing the sa
nd here some how and I had to give them 
receipts for how much s a nd they had to br
ing a full load of sand and I gave them 

the receipt s for the loads.  I had to go ch
eck if they didn™t lose on the way half or 
whatever. I gave them receipt s.  They we
re lined up for stretches and stretches of 
those things from morning until the night
.  They were working around the clock; 
they had two shifts fr om six to si x.  My shift was fr om six in the morning until si x 

at night. 
 

Q: The receipts were just to 
show that they had done this? 
 
A: They had done this and with those recei
pt s they were promised they would get 
paid eventually.  They never did. 
 
Q> I see.  Because it was too late? 

 

A: Even so, they never had intentions of honoring them. 

 

Q: And then what?   After you went back to the __? 

 

A: I went back to the --.  Then June 21, 
Germany attacked.  They attacked the --. 
 

Q: Did you know, did you have the feeli
ng that this was going to occur? 
 

A: No way, no way.  As a ma tter of fac t  I went to the beach that Sunday.  The beach 
was empty a nd I couldn™t understand why 
there was almost nobody there.  Very 
few -- I usually meet my friends th
ere; we play cards, whatever. 
 

Q: This was on the lake? 

 

A: No, it was on a river, rive r.  We  had beach
es by the river.  It™s a nice st ory; I go 
into detail ac tually. 
 
Q: I look forward to it.  Wh at was the 
first clue that ther
e was an invasion? 
 

A: The first clue was that I usually meet my
 friends like I got up in the morning.  We  
had no radio in the house.   Very few pe
ople had radios; tele
phones, only doctors 
and professionals would have
 a telephone.  Got up at eight o™clock, it was a nice 
sunny day and I went to the beach, a 15 or
 20 mi nutes walk and I went to the 
beach.  Close to nine o™clock usually 
my friends would show up already and 
nobody™s there.  Here and there, ther
e™s some body there, you know.  Go for a 
swim by yourself, how much can you be in
 the water by yourself. I go out just 
waiting for people to show up so we us
ually play cards.  Then some body around 
ten o™clock, some body s hows up.  He says 
what are you people doing here?  Don™t 
you know there™s a war?   That™s how I f
ound out.  Actually they bombed a l ready 
cities at four o™clock in the morning. 
 Four o™clock in the morning, Kiev was 

bombed, Lvov, other cities, Vilna, quite a 
few cities were bombed.  Our city was 
bombed too but a little bit later, they 
bombed our city. That
™s how I found out. 
 

Q: Were you mobilized or --? 

 

A: Well, in 1941 people one year older than
 me  were mobilized in 1941.  Their year 
was called.  Whoever was born in 1922, wa
s 19 years old, they were mobi lized 
like in March and April already, they went 
to be inducted.  At that time when the 
war broke out, they didn™t mobilize a
ny more except whoever was still around 
who was not sent away to the points wh
ere they train you, they would send them 
right away.  Again it was two weeks till 
the Germans came and they started to 
evacuate.  The first week was norma l.  Th
ey attacked but they were holding their 
ground for the first four or 
five days or some thing.  
But then they broke through 
the lines and it was disa st er.  The first week
 we were still going into the office and 
then some  of the Russian directors 
were evacuating their families already, 
mobilizing so me cars or trucks if they ha
d.  In our concer n too, the director was 
taking trucks and horse and buggies, pu
tting furniture and stuff and sending 
fa mily back to Russia.  We were just 
standing there.  The Jewish people started 
thinking about the evacuation 
because whoever was in th
e police, or whoever was 
communist or some thing, they didn™t want
 to take chances.  I think the second 

week already, it was like _______ they were 
running.  Soldiers were comi ng back 
fr om the fr onts in trucks full with soldiers
.  People tried to get rides with them; 
some did, some couldn™t succeed.  Again 
my family wouldn™t think of running; 
not only mi ne, the ma jority didn™t think 
of anything.  Even though we knew that 
the Germans, they™re against the Jews but nobody thought of some thing 

happening whatever happened. 
 

Q: Had you heard any stories about Germans?  

 

A: Of course we heard. We  heard stories 
from the other parts of Poland what they 
were two years already there.  That they
 mobilized some people to camps , labor 
camps.  The y worked them for nothing; some  guys, some ti mes they cut 
some body™s beard off and things like th
at.  There was no concentration camps, 
there was no -- at that time  there 
was no extermination, nobody even thought 

about it in 1941.  After they attacked Russia, they started there 
too, they started to 
do. 
 

Q: Were there refugees coming through your city? 

 

A: Oh yes.  We  had Germa n refugees; 
they were comi ng in 1938 yet.  Germany 
threw out Jewish people th
at their ancestry was from Poland.  They brought them 

up to a Polish border station and left th
em there.  Then different communit i es 
tried to absorb some  of t hem even though 
it was in the west part of Poland, some  

wound up by us.  Most of them had some  
fa mily or some  relations, they came 
here but some  didn™t.  Some  were trying 
to actually work their way to get into 
Russia.  They figure they go to the eastern 
part of Poland, ma ybe 
they™ll be able to 
get across the border to Russia.
  We  had quite a few refugees here.  Again, that 
was the worst thing that happened to th
em.  They threw them out of Ger many. 
 

Q: Right, right.  You see trucks with 
Russian soldiers going through and kind of 
fl eei ng --? 
 

A: Civilian Russians, civilians too evacuati
ng.  It was the second 
week all civilians, 
Russians with their fami l i es were evacuating --? 
 
Q: Then your city was bombed, soon after that? 
 

A: The city was bombed right at the end 
of the evacuation when the German planes 
and the Russian planes were still fighting each ot he r. 
 

Q: Do you remember seeing planes flying overhead? 

 

A: Well, I didn™t stick my nose out.  We  were sitting in the baseme nts because they 
were shelling.  Before the Germans came there were a few nights, there was 

tremendous shelling.  There were -- oppos
ite sides -- shells we re flying all 
through the night.  The whole house shook 
every time.  Nobody put their head 
out.  As a matter of fact, wherever we  lived
 at the time, there was a lot of gentile 
people lived there in that section.  In th
at cellar, there was 
mo stly gentile people 
there.  But nobody would stick 
their head out.  I had a chance to go there --= I™ll 
just ma ke it short.  The fellow that I acqua
inted at the airfield
, the second week of 
the evacuation, a tank pulls up in front of 
our house.  Everybody got scared in the 
neighborhood, a tank, what™s a tank doing he
re?  A Russian tank pulled up.  A 

guy come s out and goes up to our house.  Th
at™s the fellow, he came with a tank.  
He came to take me  with us.  He says
 we are evacuating, the Germans are going 
to be here any day and come  with me, I™ll 
take you back to Russia.  You mi ght be 

in trouble here, you know, the Jewish pe
ople won™t have it so good.  There was a 
discussion between my father and my moth
er, should they go, should they not go.  
I was like, I had nothing to say probably but
 I didn™t want to go.  I know I didn™t 
want to go.  I wasn™t ready 
yet to be on my own.  They
 decided not to let me  go, 
my mother especially, they don™t want to let me  go.  He left and also at the same  
time, ma ybe  a day different, quite a few 
youngsters a little b
it older than me, 
ma ybe a year or two older from the nei
ghborhood, walked out from their home s.  
Said goodbyes and they all wear these kna
psacks on them and they said whoever 
wants to join them, they™re going.  They™re
 going to try to reach Russia.  They 

went out, on the outskirts and that™s all 
we saw of them. But about two or three 
days later, they came back.  They came
 back, they couldn™t get rides with nobody 

and they couldn™t go by foot.  They all came back.  Then this fe llow came with 

the tank, he didn™t go to Russia either. 
 

Q: Hedidn™t? 

 

A: No, I me t him later, that™s a story beside
s.  They didn™t -- they told him to stay 
back and he posed as a Ukrainian.  Just 
met him by chance on the street.  I was in 
a march for labor, something during the 
German occupation, and I me t him on the 
street.  He wouldn™t look at me , we just
 looked at each other and then he put his 
head down.  He didn™t wa nt to -- I wa s ma rching in a group so of course, I 

couldn™t say nothing.  Then when we were ma rched back, he was waiting there in 

a corner and he came over to me .  He said some thing, you know I™m here and 

nobody knows, nobody is supposed to know who I am.  He s a ys I was on my way, 

they send me  back. 
 
Q: When did the first German forces enter your town? 
 

A: I think it was like July 7 or 6.  I have
 the date in the book exactly.  From the 21
st
 
of June till July 6 or 7. 
 

Q: What was the first appe arance of the German occupation?  

 

A: Well, first of all, again, it was a Sunday, the Germans ca me  i n.  We  were not in 
the street; we were in the basement all ni
ght.  In the morning we went back to the 
rooms and then one of the neighbors came in.  She says the Germans are in town 

already and you better don™t da
re to go out on the street
.  They™re catching Jews 
or whatever.  Of course we didn™t.  A 
little bit later, ther
e was a knock on the 
door, the same  day, and it was in the 
afternoon, early in the afternoon.  Two 
Ukrainian policemen were there; there we
re no Ukrainian police before, all of a 
sudden, there™s Ukrainian police, unifor ms  
and rifles.  We didn™t know at the time 
but that day also they proclaimed indepe
ndent Ukraine with the capitol in Lvov.  

The Germans let them have an independent
 Ukraine.  They had prepared already, 
evidently they were prepared for that.  
They had uniforms already.  So they came  
and they came  into the house a
nd they took my father out. 
 

Q: Did they give a reason? 
 

A: Yes, they need him for work.  My mo
ther was pleading and crying and pleading.  
We didn™t live in the city, we lived outside. 
 It wasn™t a Jewish
 section at all.  
They had plenty, there were sections wher
e there were a lot of Jews and why they 
came here, they had to cross a bridge 
--.  The mi nute they knocked on the door, 
me  and my sister, we were
 hiding under the bed or some whe r es in the bedroom 
and they took my father.  My mother 
was crying and of course we thought he™ll 
never come  back.  He didn™t show up till 
late in the evening, he came back which 
it was like a mi racle too.  He says they 
did take him to work some thing by the 
river, whatever he had to do.  Hi m and w
hoever else they caught.  He says they 

didn™t beat him and whe n they finished wh
atever they were doing; they let him 

go.  It was the first experience.  Second experience with the Germans, t he next 

day already..  We didn™t go any more in 
the baseme nt because there was no more 

shelling already so we stayed in the room.  We still didn™t dare to go in the street.  

Now I don™t reme mber if it was the second 
day or the third day, a lot of German 
cars, motorcycles pulled up in
 our street.  They stopped 
on the street and some  of 
them came into the -- we had like a yard
 in the front and they put in their 
motorcycles in the yard.  They were knoc
king on the doors; evidently they were 
shown where Jews lived.  They were not
 youngsters, they were officers, elderly 
guys and they were from the army.  Evid
ently they were asking where Jews are 
living not because -- we didn™t know, the mi
nute we saw these things we tried to 
run down the baseme nt over there by that 
time.  But my mother stayed out and 
what they were looking for, they were
 looking for Jewish people in order to 
communicate.  Because they couldn™t co
mmunicate with the ot her people and 
most of the Jews knew German some ho
w because the Yiddish and German is 
very similar.  They stopped for a rest 
and they had all kinds of provisions with 
them and they want us to cook.  They want the wome n to cook for them the stuff 

and they should have their break and eat 
and then they go further.  That™s what 
happened. 
Q: Who cooked for them?  

 

A: My mother and then there was another family there, you know.  So that™s what 
they came for. 
 

Q: They didn™t ask any questions of you? 

 

A: No, no.  They just ate.  She cooked the meal; they gave some  to us.  I think they 
gave my mother some  stuff what they
 had and then they went on their way. 
 

Q: Let™s flip the tape over. 

 

                      END OF SIDE A (ONLY ONE TAPE)  

 

A: It was the first time we saw the German 
soldiers.  Otherwise, we didn™t stick our 
head out. 

 
Q: Again your father hadn™t been 
harassed again, just that once? 
 

A: No.  We ll, then the holidays came in a
nd we -- of course we couldn™t go anywhere 
to pray.  We  started from the neighbo
rhood.  We  gathered some  people and we 
ma de like a little gathering in our house. 
 

Q: This was like Rosh Hashanah? 

 

A: This was already Yom Kippur.  Rosh Hash
anah we didn™t pray because it was that 
time when it happened that they --.  We pray
ed there, people pray
ed there.  All of 
a sudden some body ca me  in the neighborhood 
and said that Ukrainian police is 
comi ng.  They see Ukrainian police co mi ng up the street.  Everybody ran, you 

know, they took off the prayer shawl and we
nt to their home s.  Some  from a little 
further away, they had to st
ay, disperse a little bit. 
  That™s what they were 
comi ng, to check if Jewish people praying. 
 

Q: Had there been some  decree that Jews weren™t allowed to pray? 

 

A: There were a lot of decrees but this 
was right -- was only a 
day or two away or 
three from where they -- we didn™t even 
go out nothing. Then there were decrees, 
a lot of decrees.  I think within the fi rst 
week they started decrees.  First the Jews 
had to register.  They imposed the Jewish community leadership.  Otherwise they 

came to the -- there was a Jewish vice-m
ayor.  The vice-mayor was Jewish, he 
was a lawyer.  They came to him and th
ey said you better organize a Jewish 
community. 
 

Q: The Ukrainian police? 

 

A: No, no, the Germans, already the German
s ca me.  There was a building from the 
Jewish community and they found out who was the vice-mayor.  They came  to 

the leader™s house and they says we 
want in 24 hours we want a Jewish 
community leadership so we can communicate and give directions, whatever.  

They had a problem to organize it becau
se people didn™t want to serve on it 
voluntarily.  They don™t want 
to be involved with the Germans at all.  Because 
you expose yourself once you did.  This vice
-mayor tried to get some  of his 
friends and acquaintances and little 
by little they organized a community 
leadership.  Then the Germans had proc
laimed announcements 
all over the town 
that --. 
 

Q: Posters? 

 

A: Posters, yes, that we had no announci
ng on the radio.  There was no such thing.  
They had special places with thei
r posters and that™s how you announced 
everything.  Every street ha
d different places where th
ey announced what™s going 
on and that the Jewish people 
have to register at the co
mmunity center in order to 

receive food stamps, rations, food rations;otherwise you have to be registered.  
There was no kind of register, you would not
 receive rations.  They didn™t say you 
would be punished or some thing just haveto register.  The same  thing, the gentile 

population ha d an announcement.  They have
 to register in their pl aces wherever 

so most of t he people we nt to register
.  When you registered, I didn™t go, my 
father went and he registered.  They 
asked him his profession from before and 
address and everything and he
 registered.  Then I thi
nk a week or two later you 
had to go and pick up the rations.  It was 
very small rations that they gave you.  
Whatever they gave, the Jews got half of 
it.  Then every day different posters.  If 
anyone has a radio, he has to turn it in. 
 Anybody has a telephone, he has to turn it 
in.  You cannot walk on the sidewalk, a
ny Jew cannot walk on the sidewalk.  
Every Jew must have an armband with th
e Star of David, a white armband with a 
blue Star of David.  It has to be so ma
ny centime ters, ten or whatever and it has to 
be worn on the left arm.  Again, different 
-- no Jew can have a business.  If he has 
a business, he has to take in a gentile pa
rtner but at that time already the Russians 
took the businesses away and there wasn™t 
that ma ny.  They still had businesses, 
there were some  their stores were nationa
lized so they were talking about these 
stores; where the people worked for 
the Russians but it wa
s their own from 
before.  They had to take in a partner, an Ukrainian partner -- was only the 

beginning.  Then the Ukra
inian took it right over. 
 

Q: Over how many weeks did these decrees pass? 

 

A: It was ma ybe the second week the Germ
ans were already here.  Right after the 
second week or so or the end of the firs
t week, some thing like that.  It was very 
fast, very fast.  You could not own a bicy
cle. Jews  cannot own a bicycle.  Then 
again you could not be found in a gentile™
s house.  You cannot 
ma rry a gentile.  
All kinds of laws; every day a few diffe
rent things like that.  It was very 

restrict ed. 
 

Q: Do you remember your fa mily turning in anything in particular? 

 

A: Oh, yeah, sure.  It was later, we ha
d to turn in fur.  That was November, 
December, they announce on posters that ever
y Jewish fa mily has to turn in all 
their fur.  They have to bring it into th
e Jewish community so they can collect it 
for the German ar my.  They were fighting already in Russia, they got stuck for the 

winter.  They needed that and of cour
se, in those days you 
could see a lot of 
smoke going through the chimneys.  We  were burning fur but everybody had to 

turn some thing in because  they knew every family has fur.  We buried some  in the 

yard. 
 

Q: So me furs? 

 

A: My father buried some  fur, yes.  Be
cause he didn™t want 
to give it away -- 
probably still there today.  
Whatever we turned in, my mother had a nice fur coat, 
I think it™s in that book, in the picture but 
she had given it away
 already a little bit 

before that to one of the Ukrainians that
 worked with my father before.  He took 
me  in for like two or three nights to stay
 over his house because I had to report to 
go to a camp for labor already.  My mother
 wouldn™t let me  go and my father took 
me  there.  They kept me  like two, three da
ys and she promised them a fur coat so 

my father brought her fur coat there.  Th
at was before we knew that we had to 
give away fur coats. 
 

Q: Was there a marked change in the Ukrainians themselves?  Before when the 
Russians were occupying the area, the Je
ws and the Ukrainians were getting 
along? 
 

A: Right,right. 

 

Q: But at another part , the police, the collaborators --? 

 

A: At that time, even the Poles which we
re also not favorites by the Germans, the 
Ukrainians were.  The Poles were not 
favored.  Not only the Ukrainians didn™t 
want to look at us, or anything to do 
with us, but even the Poles didn™t want 
anything to do with us.  They wouldn™t help
 us, just the opposite.  They were glad 
that you™re getting paid back what the 
Russians did to us.  I had friends from 
school, that we were very friendly used 
to go to each other™s house, saw him on 
the street, he looked the other way. 
 

Q: Did you get your armband from the Jewish community center? 

 

A: No, no.  Everybody ma de their own.  Some  tailors ma de extra money on it for a 
dollar or two, whatever.  They used to ma ke it, to buy, most people ma de their 

own.  It had to be uniform.  It had to be 
a certain standard, white
 and blue that was 
the color. 
 

Q: At what point was th
ere a ghetto established? 
 

A: The ghetto was established April 1, 1942. 

 

Q: Was there anything el
se significant that happe
ned between that time ?  
 

A: Oh, yes, a lot of things happened.  Y
ou know again it™s with our registration.  
When we registered for the food rations, the Jewish community building had a list 

of everybody.  There were some  people they 
didn™t register.  
The only people they 
did not register were the ones,
 we found out later, they c
ouldn™t ma ke it to Russia.  
They came back and they were me mbers 
of Communist Youth or some where.  
One guy was a policema n for the Russians so
 they didn™t want to be exposed at 
all.  They we re in hiding like and they 
didn™t register.  Becaus
e they didn™t want 
anybody to know that they are here because
 ot herwise the German, the first thing 
they would call to them.  They were part 
of the Russian establishment.  So with 
those name s and addresses and the lists 
of the professions, what happened in 

October, I think one day it 
was in October, we woke up in the morning and we 
found out that during the night, the Germans ca me and took away 150 people.  I 

think it was in August, I™m not sure.  In
 the book I have it exactly, it mi ght have 
been August.  I think it was in August; th
ey came one night and they took out 150 
______ from different addresses, 150 people, 
doctors, lawyers, accountants.  They 

told the fami lies they taking them to work
 and the next day the peasants told us 
they took them to a fore st outside the city
 and they were shot.  This took away the 
leader ship, the intelligentsia; it was th
e people that they 
could be a potential 
leadership or some thing, that knocked out 
99%.  They left a few single doctors, 
surgeons, they left a few.  Like lawyers, it was only the vice-ma yor that he was 

the chief of the -- they called it Judenrat 
at that time.  I don™t think there was any 
other lawyers left that I recall.  With 
one shot they knocked out the cream of the 
population.  They organized in October,
 they organized a certain amount of 
people to go from the city to a labo
r camp, some where 80 kilometers away or 
whatever.  We didn™t know at
 that time  where.  Of course, they came and brought 
-- no, they got our name too.  We had a notic
e that I had to report next day to the 
Judenrat to go to that camp.  Agai
n, you know, was in the house between my 
mother and father.  My mother didn™t want
 me to let me go; my father said well 
I™ll have to go.  In the meantime they ar
e preparing a knapsack for me  with food 
and clothing whatever.  They
 didn™t know for how long; I 
think they said for three 
months.  Then you™ll come  back and other people will take your place.  The 

decision was finally that no, I should not
 go.  That™s when I we nt to that 
Ukrainian™s house where I stayed two or thre
e nights.  It was my mother™s idea.  

My father was -- he didn™t, he couldn™t deci de one way or the other.  It was just a 

plain labor camp, they didn™t shoot people 
there but a lot of youngs
ters died there; 
a lot of me n died because  it was very hard 
labor, very hard.  The work they were 
doing had nothing to do with labor.  Th
ey were moving tremendous sizes blocks 
or stones or  whatever from one pl ace to another, up a mountain, down a 

mountain.  It was in the winter, people cam
e back frozen.  They were lucky they 
came back frozen because they were bought from the fa milies.  They went and 

paid up some money to the Judenrat and they were able to send a certain amount 

back.  Then the Judenrat sent other peopl
e there, mobilized other people.  They 
didn™t want to go, they came  to the house, it was Jewish police already, and they 

took them.  There was no question, th
ere was no place where to run.  These 

people they came back, one of my friends 
came back and he had one of his toes 
frozen up completely, more than one. 
 

Q: Did your father ever get called for labor? 

 

A: No, my father --they ca
lled a certain amount of a ge 
groups.  Like from 18 to 30 
or something like that -- my father at th
at time was already fifty --, was born in 
1890, so he was already 52 years old, 51.  
They wouldn™t call him;  they first 
called the people that could do labor. 
 

Q: So the ghetto was for me d -- so up to that point you ma naged to avoid having to go 
to any camps? 

 
A: Up to that point, yes.  That camp wa s eventually liquidated, burned with people in 
it. 
 

Q: What was the name  of that camp, do you know? 

 

A: Yes, there we re two.  One was in Kamunka and the other was Boogerkey.  It was 
in the same  state like but it was a goo
d couple hours traveling by horse and buggy 
if not more. 
 

Q: So a typical day for you was --? 

 

A: Myday? 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: I didn™t go no place.  I had to report to 
the Jude nr at once a week for labor there.  
They took me wherever they assigned me  
to go, to a factory or some thing.  Very 
few times that I reported but I had no c
hoice because otherwise they would take 
me. From there they would take me to th
e camp but once they were taken October 
to camp already, I didn™t report af
ter that, I just stayed home. 
 

Q: I see.  What was --? 

 

A: They also took wome n.  They took my 
sister a few times to work.  There was 
quite a -- this city was like a county seat
.  All the ma in offices from the German 
authorities were in that city, not in the ot
her cities, was in that state like in that 
part of the county.  They ha
d police, they had Gestapo, they had zonderdees, they 
had all kinds of different ci
vilian authorities.  All th
ese people needed labor for 
nothing.  They were taking some  to clean homes, offices for the Germans; they 

were taking wome n, young girl
s or wome n.  To do heavier labor, they would take 
me n.  I f some factory was short of some  
kind of l a bor, they™d tell the Judenrat, I 
need 50 people today, I need 30 people 
today and they would have to supply. 
 

Q Was there any violence at that time  against Jews? 

 

A: Well, there was, but again it was on a ve
ry small scale.  The Germans used to 
come  at night even though there was no ghetto yet but they used to come  in the 

Jewish section.  They would come  to a certain house and take away the silverware 

and other things.  They would just come  
and take it.  Some  would walk in dogs 
and they would see a Jew with a beard, th
ey would let the dog go and sic him or 
they™d catch one, they™d cut his beard offin the street.  They wanted to beat 

some body, t here were cases where some  pe
ople were beaten up.  That™s why I 
tried not to be on the street at all, not to
 show myself.  Being we lived outside, we 
didn™t live in the mi ddle of the town, I c
ould do it.  People that live in the town 
had no choice because the police were ther
e, the others were there and that™s 

where they were walking, day and night.  
They also had the -- it was some thing 
like nobody could have a radio.  They went
 into one house and they spotted a 
radio.  So they took the whole fa mily.  Fi
rst the ma n that had the radio went away, 
they found a radio, he we nt out, he went aw
ay.  They said if they don™t find him, 
the Jewish co mmunity would not fi nd that man, they would kill the people fr om 
the house, this family.  I 
don™t recall already what ha
ppened, did they shot the 
whole fa mily or did they got the ma n back because word came  to him about how 

they™re going to kill the fa mily.  Also late
r, with the fur, they caught some  fur in 
some body™s house and they killed the fa m
ily, the whole fa mily.  But on a scale 
like, a big scale, no, not yet. 
 

Q: The ghetto was for med in April? 

 

A The ghetto was formed in April, yes. 

 

Q: How did that come  about? 

 

A: Well they hung out posters a few weeks be
fore that, I think it was the first week 
of March or some thing, that by April 1
st
 all the Jews from surrounding streets 
which are not on the ma p and they included the ma p where the ghetto would be, 

have to be out.  If they wouldn™t be 
out, they would be s
hot.  Everything was 
under the threat of being shot. 
 The same  thing to the gentil
es.  If they lived in the 
parts where there™s going to be the ghe
tto on those streets 
and if they™re found 
there after the 1
st
, they would be shot.  The ma jority of move me nt was from the 
outskirts in, not from the ghetto out becau
se very few gentiles lived in the mi ddle 
of the town; the ma jority was Jewish.  Bu
t some  of them did leave there to go out, 
find a place or whatever. 
 

Q: So you had to leave your home , I guess? 

 

A: We had to leave our home, yes.  We  left our home  and my father had an 
acquaintance that lived in the part  that was 
going to be the ghetto.  He let us have 
one room.  He says we could use the kitc
hen together with hi
s wife or whatever, 
some thing like that.  Of course we had 
so much belongings and furniture that we 
couldn™t put it there.  We  ha
d to put it in his baseme
nt, everything went in the 
basement. 
 

Q: You were able to take most of your things? 

 

A: Yeah, you could take anything you wa
nted if you had where to put it. 
 

Q: You, your mother, father and sister shared a room?  

 

A: We shared a room, one room. It was like about three or four families in that 
building or  so mething like that.  Was a one-story building and a fa mily in the 

baseme nt living too. 

 
Q: Was this ghetto ba
rricaded in any way? 
 

A: No, actually they had two ghettos.  Our ghetto was on the small part, it was a very 
small section of the ghetto.  It was ma ybe, 
ma ybe  a fourth of the size of the ma in 
ghetto.  Wh at I say ma in ghetto is, there we
re separated by one of the ma in streets 
of the city.  That side was separated and there was a ma in street running through 

the town from one end to the other, to 
the railroad station.  The ma jority was on 
the right side of that thing and we were 
on the left side.  Of course, we could not 
go from one  to the other except during 
the day, certain hours.  We were not 
allowed to be from six o™clock on or fi
ve, I think from six o™clock on, we were 
not allowed to be on the street at all.  
It was a curfew like for the Jewish pe ople, 
you could not be on the street.  If they ca
ught you on the street you could be shot.  
In order to cross from one ghetto to th
e other, also you expose yourself because 
there was the ma in street.  There could be
 Germa n traffic, it could be Ukrainian 
police traffic and very seldom did I vent
ure from here to there except on a 

Sunday.  On a Sunday, the Germans did thei
r thing home  and it was like a -- there 
was no business going on like that.  I ventur
ed on a Sunday to the ma in ghetto and 
I had a lot of friends there and on the streets and so on. 
 

Q: You would still report to th
e Judenrat office to get rations? 
 

A: No, no. We l l  rations were 
given till the ghetto.  Li ke 
in the beginning there were 
rations going on.  When the ghetto was es
tablished there was no rations for Jews, 
they did away with rations. 
 
Q: So food became relatively scarce? 
 

A: Oh, food be came a very difficult thing for 
some  people, yes.  People had to trade 
whatever they had, their be
longings; would go to the edge of the ghetto and trade 
with the gentiles and all that.  They woul
d come  to the fence and barter this for 
that but mos t  of the people still had some thing. 
 But then after April 1
st
, they 
started to br ing into the ghetto, people from surrounding communities, from little 

villages, not little vi llages where the Jews 
were killed already, fr om little towns.  

They didn™t want little ghettos in each to
wn.  Their plan was to concentrate in 
biggest cities so they can get to them 
better.  They brought in more people and 
that ma de it worse.  Not only just wi th
 food, there™s no place where to stay.  
People slept in hallways; it was a pity 
for those people that they came from 
outside.  We  were in already there with 
people, more or less established.  But it 
didn™t last that long.  It la
sted till August and they li
quidated, they ma de actions, 
they started actions. 
 

Q: What do you reme mber about the actions? 

 

A: Well, again it™s -- if I have
 to tell you details, it would take a long time and you™re 
probably going to pick some thing what you 
want from the book.  I have it detailed 

exactly and it™s a fast reading book, no ma tter 
what and it™s also not so pleasant.  I 
also have an account that I 
copied from the Memo rial B
ook from one girl that she 
lives in Brooklyn. She was actually caught
 on the train the same  day when my 
sister and father, we were all taken outtogether fr om the house.  But it™s a long 

story and I don™t know if you 
want to -- specially if 
you™re going to have there 
exactly. 
 

Q: Right, right.  You eventually were
 deported, the ghetto was liquidated? 
 

A: No, no, I wasn™t deported.  From our  
territories they did not take any to 
concentration camps.  If th
ey would have taken ma ybe
 some  people would have 
rema ined, people that could have lasted 
or were strong enough to survive.  But 
they did not take to any concentration cam
ps. The y killed them right there on the 
spot and they had special woods, on the airf
ield where the airfield was built, they 
ma de ma ss graves there, you know. 
 

Q: How did you ma nage to avoid the --? 

 

A: Again, it™s a detailed story. 

 

Q: I see.  I™ll get that from t he book. 

 

A: Mostly it™s my mother had 
a big part in it too. Probably if
 not for her, I don™t think 
I would be able to ma nage.  She got in
to a few different situations where she 

knew some  people and we bought our way out
 or some thing like that.  Otherwise 
I™d probably be there, you know. 
 

Q: Had you heard about the Anslagrupen? 

 

A: Of course, of course we heard about it.
  They were doing it; there were rumors 
just before our actions.  Th
ere were ru mors that they were doing it in the Russian 
territory.   Right over the border was Russi
a where they™re going with those trucks 
and they put the exhaust systems and they ta
ke the people.  By the time  they come  
to where they tell them they take them, they™re half dead. 
 

Q: What about liberation for you? 

 

A: Well, that™s -- I was liber ated by the Russi
an soldiers but actually taken out of a 
grave.  Not just me , about eight people, we dug a grave. 
 

Q: It™s incredible.  You dug a grave? 

 

A: No, we dug a place to hide.  We  had a pl
ace to hide before for a couple weeks and 
then we had to come  out toward the end 
when the Germans were retreating.  We 
knew it™s a ma tter of days, we were in th
e open all the time .  I was in the open 
most of the time , on a far m.  We  tried to find a place to hide between when the 

fronts are going to go through.  We  were di
scovered in one place; we didn™t want 
to be there.  We dug a place where we
 thought nobody would be looking; then 
went in there.  The next day after we
 went in there, the Russians came through 
and we did not know for two weeks.  We
 did not know.  The city was liberated 
already for ten days or some thing like that. 
 

Q: You were still --? 

 

A: We were still there.  We  had prepared
 food and water.  Then we had to go for 
water more.  It™s a --. 
 

Q: Verycompe lling. 

 

A: Finally we came  out of t he hole and th
e soldiers were cryi ng.  Was a Jewish 
officer and a few Russian soldiers; they were crying.  Some body came with them 

that knew that we are ther
e but they didn™t know exactly where.  He came and he 
was a few hours there trying to find us in 
which spot.  It was dangerous for them 
to be there because again, the place where I was on that farm in the village, it was 

the center of the Ukrainian nationalist s. 
 They were fighting the Russians and the 
Germans be cause the independent Ukraine 
lasted only three months.  Aft e r that, 
the Germans annulled it.  They were alre
ady against the Germans and special for 
the Russians, they were against the Russians. 
 It™s a story, the liber
ation itself.  It™s 
a separate chapter. 
 

Q: How long did you rema in in your town after _________? 

 
A: Not too long.  First of all whoever we 
knew, the gentile people didn™t -- they were 
not so happy we even came , to see anybody 
survive.  We had like I say about ten 
thousand Jewish people in this city befo
re and there was about 50 or 60 survived 
from the German occupation.  Some  survived that they went to Russia; they 
ma naged to get there.  So me  survived, ma ybe 150 or so.  But the few that 

survived, we didn™t want  to be there 
because everything was against us.  I 
ma naged to get a job back in the same concern; the Russians came back, the 

concern opened up and I me t some body that 
worked from before, just one person.  

She was happy to see me , it was a Russian woma n, very happy to see me .  But 

then again it was a problem with the army
 and I didn™t want to leave my mother 
alone. 
 

Q: Yourmothersurvived? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Yourfather? 

 

A: My father and my sister went in the fi
rst action.  They had four.  We  went through 
two actions, in August and October.  December 1
st
 we were already out of the 
city.  We  we nt to a small village, a farm. 
 
Q: You were in labor there? 

 

A: Well, it was wintertime, there was no wor
k.  But in the spring, they kept us to 
work on that far m.  From that farm I went
 to another farm.  Ri ght after I left the 

far m, people were killed on that farm. 
 

Q: This is where you were carry
ing your sacks with pictures? 
 

A: Right,right. 

 

Q: I reme mber from some of the phot
ographs in the book where in Italy --? 
 

A: I™ll show you some .  As I say, very fe w pi
ctures that I was able to save but they 
were in my pocket.  Some of the pictures, th
is is my father, this is my sister.  See 
this pictur e was in my wallet.  This pi ctur
e I got --  this was also in the wallet.  
This is from Italy.  Let™s see, these I ma de
 copies of them.  This is my father.  

This is a picture of my -- I 
played in a band, a school band. 
 

Q: What instrument is this? 

 

A: It™s like a mandolin type or 
a lyca type.  This is Italy. 
 
Q: So your plan was to go to Palestine? 
 

A: Yes, of course, of course.  We  had 
no name s or addresses, nothing.  We  ha d 
fa mily here but I had nothing. 
 

Q: Didn™t know where they were? 

 

A: Didn™t know where they were, didn™t know
 their name s, nothing.  Again yes.  
This is  -- my mother from her young year
s yet, okay, it™s from Russia yet that 

picture.  Here we had a protest in
 Bari.  Did you ever hear of Bari? 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: I was there ma ybe a year or more.  That
 time  we protested ag
ainst Bevin.  He was 
a foreign mi nister from England and he™s 
the one that was catching the people that 
tried to get into Palestine, 
put them in Cyprus in camps. 
 

Q: Right, we were hear
ing about that, yes. 
 

A: So we were protesting, I th
ink he was in Italy at that 
time .  Thi s  is in Italy, a 
picture.  This friend here he was one in
 that labor camp that I was telling you 
about, he™s in Israel.  This is my mot her™s
 picture.  That™s th
e fur coat what she 
had that I was telling you. 
 
Q: That™s the one she traded away? 

 

A: She didn™t trade it, she just gave it 
away because they took me  for two, three 
nights there.  These are pe
ople that came  to visit us from Russia in 1940, they 
came to visit.  They went to a resort 
pl ace and my mother and my sister went 

there.  That™s my mother and that™s my 
sister and they met the family there.  
That™s my father™s sist er, they were from 
Kiev, they came to visit us.  Let™s see.  

That™s my mother and father.  I think that
™s the first picture th
ey took in the city 
when I was born. 
 

Q: Your mother™s very pretty. 

 

A: This is my business school picture. 

 

Q: You were bookkeeping then?   Is th
at what you considered yourself? 

 

A: Yeah, we were studying there for accountan
cy and I graduated, I had my  diploma.  
I had a picture of all the gra
duates, that went too with 
the sack.  That™s a cousin 
from Kiev and this is my sister.  I d
on™t know how it wound up that this was in a 
different place.  As I said I had two s
acks actually.  This wound up in the other 
sack.  They™re not even my fa mily; they™re some body™s family that we knew and 
the family is here.  There is a sister  to
 that woma n and we ma de copies, we gave 
them.  Here™s my father and my sister
; the picture™s taken, I don™t know, 1933 or 
4.  I think I sent this pictur
e also.  I gave one of these 
pictures, ma de copies, they 
should have it here. 
 
Q: BenLiss? 

 

A: He should have it there.  If you want to
 take an extra one, I have it, you can have 
an extra one.  This is my sister, that™s
 a friend at the Jewish gy mnasium.  The 
Russians came  in 1939, they set the Jewish
 gymnasium.  I made copies for that 
reason to --.  That™s why you have thes
e, you saw that _____.  I should have that 
too and I think I sent this here.  I sent a 
copy of that and that™s a copy of my sister. 
 

Q: Your mother and father? 

 

A: My sister.  I think I sent fr om my mo
t her and me later too. 
 I sent pictures, you 
know. 
 

Q: I™ll check with Ben Liss.  If I can™t 
get them from you, will I be able to borrow 
photos for copies? 

 
A: Yeah, yeah.  Now here again this is in 
the resort area; my sister and my cousin 
from Kiev.  This is in Ro mania. 
 

                (TAPE ENDS AT THIS POINT.)
