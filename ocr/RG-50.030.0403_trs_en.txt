MICHAEL NAOUM MATSAS 
 October 4, 1999 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning. 
Answer: Good morning. How are you? 
Q: I™m just fine and how are you? 
A: Thank you. 

Q: Good. Ca n you tell me when and where you were born? 

A: I was born Ioannina, Greece, in 1930. 

Q: And tell me a little about your family. 

A: My fa mily are -- if we go back a few generati
ons, they have been in Ioannina for I would say 
hundreds of years. And my father™s fa mily was ma
inly in the wine and cheese business. And my 
grandfather on the part of my
 mother, he was a merchant. 
Q: And wha t  did your father do? 

A: My father was an employee of the nationa l bank of Greece.  

Q: And did your mother work as well? 

A: No, at that time  women were mi nding theirown houses, and they have ma ids to the do the 

work, and they were very happy that way. 

Q: We re you fairly well off as a fa mily? 

A: I would say upper mi ddle class. 

Q: So did you have ma ids in the house? 

A: My parents, yes. One. One ma id.  

Q: And how long did you live in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
2 
 
A: In -- in Ioannina for five years, and then my
 father was transferred to
 Arta and then Preveza, 
and in 1940 we were in Agrini. 
Q: And why -- why were you moving so ma ny times?  

A: That™s -- that™s probably the bank 
would do it with this -- their employees. 
Q: And wha t  is your earliest me mories of your family? 

A: I reme mb er everything that happened fr
om 1935 on, I have a very clear me mory of 
everything.  

Q: We re you conscious of the fact even t
hough you were only six year
s old in 1936, of st -- 
things that were going on in Germa ny?  Did you
 reme mber hearing thin
gs about the Nazis? 
A: From -- we knew that there were Jews 
who were passing from Greece on their way to 

Palestine or other pl aces. And I reme mber in 1938 a 
friend of my father told him that in case of 
need, I would like you to change your identity an
d you and your fa mily go to the house of my 
father in a remote mount ain village.  
Q: Did you think that was a possibi
lity?  Did your fa mily think that
 was really going to happen?   
A: We ll, at that time  seeing what it wa s happening
 in Germany, and seeing that we had a fascist 
dictatorship in Greece, ever
ythi ng was possibl e, yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you experience anti-Se mitism as a 
young boy?  This is be fore the Italians came, 
before the Germans came. 
A: No, the -- the first time I wa
s aware that there was some thing 
different if you are a Jew, was 
when I was going to the Jewish school, and we we
nt for a parade, and then, although we came  to 

the staging point quite early, we had to wait and 
I didn™t like that. So I to
ld the teacher why are 
we waiting, and other schools have come  after us
 and they pass. And the teacher, who happened 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
3 
 
to be a Christian, said we are th
e Jewish school, that™s why we have
 to wait. So I realized that 
being a Jew was not a good thing. 
Q: Did that bother you? 

A: Of course. 

Q: Did you go home  and talk to
 your parents about it, or -- 
A: I don™t reme mber that. 

Q: And did you talk with the other ki
ds about it, or wa -- this was -- 

A: My -- I don™t remember that  either. 

Q: When you moved to Agrinio in 1940, yes? 

A: Yes. 

Q: There were very few Jews in that town. 

A: That™s correct, there were only 40 Jews in 
Agrinio, while there were 
almost 2000 in Ioannina, 
so there was a big difference. Agrinio was calle
d also Vrahori, or Evraiohori, which means a 
Jewish village. Why?  Because in 1821, there 
were 200 Jewish fa milies in Agrinio. And what 
happened to these 200 Jewish fa milies, I think 
has significant meaning and it expl ains in my 
opinion why there were so few Greek righteous Ge
ntiles in the second Wor l d Wa r. I counted in 
the Yad Vashem list something like 124 name s pl
us 40 spouses. And in my experience, I know 
of 12 other righteous Gentiles who should be in th
at list, and they are not
. But still the numbers 
are very sma ll. And then, in addition to that, th
e losses of the Greek Jews
 were great. 89 percent 
were transported outside of Greece and 87 pe
rcent were killed, or 67,000 Jews. So what 

happened in 1821 was a very little 
known historic event. The Turk
s killed in Istanbul the Greek 
patriarch of Constantinople. And they forced f
our Jewish porters to throw his body to the sea. 
When this became known to what was then Greece, and at that time  Greece was muc h smaller 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
4 
 
than it is now, the 5000 Jews of Greece were ma ssacred. A few who survived were converted to 
Christianity. One of the leaders of the Greek na
tion, Kanellos Deligiannis
 was a great righteous 
Gentile of that period, and he saved 12 Jews w
hom he hid in his house in Tripolitsa. The anti-
Jewish feelings of the population were so strong
 that Deligiannis was forced to keep these 12 
Jews hidden in his house for three years. And only 
in 1824 he was able to secretly move them to 
the Ionian Island of Zakinthos which it was not
 then under Greek control. So, going back to 
Agrinio and the 40 Jews, these people have co
me mainly from Arta. There were many small 
me rchants and one of them was a teacher who du
ring the war became one of the five leaders of 
the resistance in our area. His name  was Yunas 
Munis. I would say about Agrinio that Agrinio 
has the distinct honor of being possibly the only 
city in German occupied Europe where all the 
Jews did not obey any German regulations and they
 all survived. And I rea
lly can™t think of any 
other city where some thing like that happened, but 
I should say that we we re very fortunate that 
we did not have a rabbi, and 
we did not have any community leaders, because in Greece the 
rabbis and community leaders, w
ith one or two very rare exce
ptions proved to be totally 
incapable of facing the pr oblems that
 the German occupation presented.  
Q: Did you -- did you move to Agrinion be
fore the Italians attacked Greece? 

A: That -- that -- that™s corre
ct, the -- we moved in Agrinion some time in March of 1940, and 
yeah, Italy attacked Greece on Octobe r 28
th
, 1940. About this war I w
ould like to say that the 
Jewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great
. Out of 77,000 Jews, 12,800 were -- served in the 
army, and that included my father and ma ny of my relatives. Over 500 
were killed, including a 
cousin of my mother™s. Over 3,700 were wounded, including at least 
two or three of our 
relatives. To these numbers I would like to 
add the 1,600 Jewish Pale
stinian volunteers who 
served with the British expeditiona
ry force. And one of them was 
the father of the former Pri me 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
5 
 
Minister of Israel, Shimon Peres, and he was not
 able to be evacuated with the British and he 
became a partisan of ELAS. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I would like also to say that the greatest 
Greek hero of the second Wor l d Wa r was a Greek 
Jewish colonel, Mordechai Frizis, who, with hi
s troops, stopped the Ita
lian advance, giving the 
allies their first victory of the second 
World Wa r. Mordechai Frizis was killed.  
Q: I don™t know when this happened, you joined 
a national youth organizati
on that was actually a 
fascist organi zation -- 

A: Ah, yes, that -- that™s -- 

Q: -- can you -- 

A: -- that ™s quite -- 

Q: -- talk about that some? 

A: -- yes. In Agrinion we we
re only two Jewish boys among 1
,000 students in the -- the high 
school. And I™m grateful to the people who were in charge , because every able bodied boy was a 

me mber of the youth -- the fascist youth organiza
tion. And I™m grateful to them for not knowing 
that Jews were not allowe d to join that fascist 
organization, or knowingly they allowed us to join 
them. I know that I was going around giving the 
fascist salute f -- until the war started. 
Q: And why were you glad that no one kicked you out, or -- 

A: Because I never liked to be discrimi nated ag
ainst. So being a fascist suit me  fine, although I 
did not realize that it was so bad at that time . 

Q: And wha t  were you doing in the organization?
 O -- th-they obviously di
dn™t talk about Jews 
or do racial things, did they? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
6 
 
A: No, no, they -- they did not. They -- w-we w
ould parade, we would -- we  -- we had lectures 
about Greek nationalism. Th-The
re was nothing offensive as fa
r as I know at that time, you 
know, about th-this organization. 
Q: So you were about 10 years old? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And how long were you in that group? 

A: Until October 1940. 

Q: So when the Italians attacked? 

A: Yes, then the school actually closed, and we 
were very glad that the classes ended, without 
realizing what the war meant. 

Q: So school closed in Oc tober -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- or November. 
A: And a -- when the war started 
it closed, and then it started agai
n in -- in other buildings, some  
warehouses, because the school buildings were us ed as hospitals. 
Q: So did you then go back to school? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And with the same  teachers and the same  kids? 

A: Yes, everything the same . 

Q: So the fact that there were two Jewish student
s in the high school, the It
alians did not kick out 
the Jewish students? 

A: The Italians? F-First of all, reme
mber that the war started on October 28
th
, but the -- and the 
Germans attacked in April of 1941. Only after th
at time  the Germans first, and the Italians 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403

second, came. The Italians were excellent  in Greece. While in Italy the 50,000 Jews lost their 
civil rights in 1938 with Mussolini™s Aryan manif 
-- ma nifesto, in Greece, thanks to the Italian 

commander general Carlo Geroso, we enjoyed all ci
vil liberties. The -- we were able to -- to go 
to -- to the -- to school, while the Italians were 
not able to do that. Actually there were 94 Italian 
university professors who were dismissed, five It
alian Jewish admi rals, a
nd five Italian Jewish 
generals who were dismissed. But in Greece we en
joyed all freedom and Carlo Geroso refused to 
cooperate with General Lohr, Alexander Lohr, th
e German general in th
e persecution of the 
Jews. So we were very happy with the Italians, 
and we -- we lived a very normal life in the 
Italian zone, business was as usual, we  went to
 the movies, and my mother was making cookies 

which a neighbor of hers, Maria Dema rdi used to
 send to partisan hospitals, once the partisan 
move ment became stronger. 

Q: So between 1940 and 1942, life does not change very much. 

A: Life was absolutely beautiful for us under th
e -- under the Italians. An
d there -- there was one 
mome nt that the Italians aske
d us to register, and none t
hought anything of it, and they 
registered, and I know of only one person from 
Preveza who did not trust the Italians, only one. 
And he took his parents and went into hiding. Th
-That™s how he survived later on the Germans. 
But we registered. And -- I™m ashamed to say 
that. And 30 years later 
I found out that Mussolini 
ma de a deal with the Germans that they were sup
posed to -- to arrest us, and move us to camps 
in the Ionian Islands and It
aly. But of course, you know, Ital
y capitulated and this did not 
happen, but the Germans came.  

Q: You know, you wrote in your book that you, at fi
rst the family, it seemed, had hoped that the 
Germans would occupy rather than the Italians
 because you thought they
 would be better.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403

Q: That™s another unfortunate kind of thinking in
 Greece, but reme mber that in Greece at least 30 
to 40 percent of population were pro-German. That
™s a significant number. And because the -- 
the Greeks de feated the Italians in Albania, we we
re afraid that the Ital ia
ns mi ght come there and 
be vindictive, while the -- the Germans actually
 did not find significant 
resi stance because many 
Greek generals were pro-German. 
Q: So you were surprised? 

A: We  were surprised that the Italians behave
d in such a nice way. I have to say that the 
Germans be haved very well too, 
when they entered our area. 
Q: And they entered your area in April of nin -- ™43? 

A: Yes. Some ti me  at the end of April, 40 -- ™
41. Only in Salonica they 
did not behave well, but 
in our area they passed through and they did not bother anybody. 

Q: But your -- your area was the Italian zone? 

A: I happene d to be -- because my father was m
obilized, we were in -- in Ioannina when the 
Germans came in first. And they behaved ve
ry well, they did not bother anybody, although the 

Jewish community of 2,000 approxima tely, people ex
isted there, and they 
-- they ju -- simply 
passed. And then the Italians came,
 and they behaved very well. 
Q: So you moved back from Agrinion to -- 

A: Yes, from -- from Ioannina, once my father 
became a civilian again, we moved to Agrini, and 
my father went back to his 
bank. In other words, the Germ
ans passed through Ioannina -- 
Q: In ™41?  

A: In ™41, and since this was the Italia
n zone of occupation, they did not stay. 
Q: Right. 

A: The Italians were in ch
arge until September of 1943.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
9 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Then, once Italy capitulated, the Germans came 
in. When they came  in Agrinio and they -- 
they loved the fact that the Italians were so af
raid of the resistance and 
they had their buildings 
fortified, and with all kinds of
 guns around them, and they wanted to give a good lesson to the 
resistance. So 120 elite German troops went on 12 
trucks and they moved straight towards the 

headquarters of the partisans in the city of Ther
mi . What they did not know was that this lady I 
me ntioned before with the cookies, Maria Dema rd
i, who was fluent in Ge rman, had become  the 
interpreter for the German commander of Ag
rini. The partisans were waiting. Out of 120 
Germans, one wounded motorcyclist returned to 
Agrinion, and he -- even 
he died in -- within 
two days. And the Germans tried to
 keep it secret, and they did not
 even retaliate or shoot any 
hostages. Well, they learned their 
lesson and that  meant that in the 
future they would not dare to 
go to the mountains unless they had a very strong
 force, which served us very well later on.  
Q: So, how did your life change 
once the Italians capitulated?  
A: We ll, from one point of view, you didn't -- it 
did not change much. The r e were little things, 
like for example, the -- we had 
the neighbor, the director of the 
bank of agriculture, whose in -- 
in -- the Germans wanted to -- to buy one of 
-- one room in his house. His mother wa nted 

some body t o go there while the Germans were in th e house. She selected me . So here I am, a 15 

year old Jewish boy, going there, you know, to pr
otect the old mother. I find a very handsome, 

young German, very polite, and I thought we be
came  friends because since he did not know 
Greek, and I did not know Ger ma
n, we played with the word good. And we figured out we knew 
it in Latin, ancient Greek, Germa
n, Fr-French,Italian, Sp
anish. I -- I knew it in
 Hebrew too, but I 
kept my mo uth shut. And then all of a sudde
n I said, English, good. And the German became  
furious and he slapped me . The mi s t ake that I ma de
 was that I was thinking in terms of the word 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
10 
 
good, and he was thinking in terms of people 
good. And obviously he didn't like the English 
people. So I -- I understood that some thing wa
s wrong. Another thing that happened was I was 
sitting in the balcony of my -- our apartment, and I saw a German chasing a young ma n who 
obviously was a -- a man of the resistance and he 
was shooting at him. The German entered the 
courtyard of the house following the resistance 
ma n. The -- the ma n of t he resistance passed 

through the first floor apartments
 and jumped out of the window right under my balcony. The 
German entered the courtyard and he saw the st
airs leading to our house, and the door was open. 
He ran through there, passed through a corridor, 
came  right next to me  in the balcony. He aimed 
at the resistance ma n down below, and he pr
essed the trigger. The gun jumped. The German 
looked at me  to see whether I was happy, but I was pe
trified. So he looked at 
this guy in disgust, 
and he left. Another thing that 
-- that happened was the Germans would send German soldiers to 
search the houses for weapons. And I reme mber 
a very polite, mi ddle aged German knocked at 
the door, my mother opened the door
. He indicated he wanted to 
search, he opened one drawer, 
and my mother pretended that he was an honored
 guest and she treated him the way the -- a -- a 
guest is supposed to be treated in Greece by o
ffering him some  s weets, you know, in a little plate 
with a spoon and a glass of water. The German 
fe lt embarrassed. He did not search anything else. 
He bowed politely and he left. Another little -- 

Q: We re you -- were you there -- 

A: I was there, yes. 

Q: -- at the time? We
re you frightened? 
A: No, I wouldn™t -- I mean, with 
the exception of the slap, that wa
sn™t a very strong, I -- I didn't 

have any bad experience. The next thing that 
happened was we bought a horse load of wheat. 
And the villager who brought the hors
e with the wheat told my fath
er, in this bag there is a gun 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
11 
 
and ammunition for your friend Christos Bokoros, w
ho was one of the leader
s of the resistance. 
Well, my father wanted to get rid of the gun as 
soon as possible. So within a few mi nutes I had a 
basket with the gun, the ammunition and some  other unimportant items, and I was supposed to 
go to the house of Bokoros. My
 father thought I was going to go 
through the back streets. Not 
me . I went through the -- through the ma in street
, through the ma in square of Agrinion. I even 
touched a Ge rman as I was passing. And I realiz
ed that what I was doing was dangerous only 
when I gave the gun to the sister of Bokoros, 
and I saw how -- how frightened she was. So 
basically that™s how our life was until one da
y -- Yunas Munis that I me ntioned before, the 
teacher, went  to my father and told him, you 
know something, the -- one of the merchants, I 
think it was either Misann or 
Munis, went on business to Athe
ns to buy merchandise. And he 
found out that all the Jewish shops
 were closed, and he was told 
that the Jews went into hiding. 
So he came back to us, and he told everybody, a
nd we are all going to leave, and I™m leaving 
tomorrow morning. So we -- although we didn™t know
 why the Jews went into hiding, we were 
not going to -- to wait. And we got ready to 
go, but we didn™t know where to go. So we asked 
one neighbor who was a right wing ma n. He told us to
 go to Arta, and from Arta to go to the area 
of -- of Zerbes, General Zerbes who was the ri
ght wing partisans. The only problem is how -- 
how do you go from Agr i nio to Arta, you know, it 
was a good idea, but it™s not possible to -- 
there was no real transpor tation and up til that tim
e, we were using mainly Italian cars for the 
move me nt to different cities. So we asked our 
other friend, Christos Bokoros, who was with the 
left wing resi stance, and he said, well, come  to 
our house, and I will pr ovide transpor tation. In o -
- in othe r words, in -- in Greece, even a f -- a f -- ma n like my father, who was an assi milated 

Jew with -- all hi s friends were Christians, you 
know, because they would not -- he di dn™t ha ve 
that much in common with the lit
tle me rchants who were there. 
We  were friendly, but all his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
12 
 
friends were Christians. Still, 
we did not know what to do, we  needed help. So we we nt to the 
house of Bokoros, and he was goingto provide transportation with horses, but all the horses 
disappeared because a battle was taking place, and 
both sides used all available forces. And my 
father, who was a good bank employee, he wanted to
 give his books in good order to the director 
of the bank, and transfer also the money. And 
he was wasting time. A -- a German sol dier 
entered the house of Bokoros to just look around. 
The Bokoros fa mily became scared. So one of 
the Bokoros boys went to the bank and he told the 
director, and saw Mr. Mats
as working there, if 
anything happens to him, I will consider you res
ponsible. The director, knowing that the Bokoros 
fa mily was with resi stance told hi m I -- I don™t keep him here, I will si gn everythi ng away. Sure 

enough, he signed the money -- for the money and ev
erything without even counting it, and my 
father went to wait with [i ndecipherable] in the 
house. Well there, since 
h-he couldn™t find any 
horses, he go, how about a taxi?  Sure enough, he 
brought the taxi there, 
we  loaded all our food 
supplies, clothing and everything el
se, and put it -- some  mor e  peopl
e in the taxi, and we left in 
style. Within mi nutes we were at the control point , a German soldier checked the identity cards 

of the people. The driver gave to the German so
me  cookies and raisins, and that was the last 
German I saw. Nobody had violated any rules or
 regulations, and nothing was punishable, there 
was no crime involved. We simply went out, and th
at was it. Within mi nu
tes we saw the first 
partisan of ELAS. And I have to say I took a 
look at his hat, and I saw the word ELAS and I 
thought I di scovered a spelling mi stake. Ellas, wh
ich means Greece, is written with two l™s, and 
he had ELAS with one l because this was the 
ethnic [indecipherable] status, me aning Greek 
liber ation army. 

Q: And wha t  was the politics of 
that -- of that liberation army? 
A: We knew nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
13 
 
Q: You knew nothing. 
A: We  knew nothing. All we knew that these pe
ople were fighting the Germans and only 
actually after the war we found out
 that many of the leaders were
 communists. But they were 
fighting the Germans, the -- they did not know any 
more than we did, and all I know is that they 
had beautiful songs which I loved and I still sing. 

Q: Would you sing one of those for us? 

A: Oh boy. Yes, why not?  You mean now? 

Q: Sure. 

A: All right. I will gi ve you the translation first. 
One of them starts like that, that there™s thunder 
in the mount of Olympus , and there is lighteni
ng in the mouth -- th-the mount of Jonah. The 
mountain [indecipherable] are roaring and [indecipherable] is shaking. And then it extols him, 

asks all the people to take up arms and fight for fr
eedom. So, [sings in Greek
 here]. That™s one of 
them. 
Q: That™s very nice.  
A: So, with a taxi we went to the end of the 
road, s-some  30 miles away
 from Agrinio. And then 
we rented horses, because we wanted to be as
 far away from roads as
 possible. And we pass 
through really unmarked paths, there were no wheel
s in that village of Psilovrahos. The people 
there, unless they went to a city, they never sa
w a wheel, because it was very difficult terrain on 
the slopes of a mountain. But very beautiful, overlooking a river, which now became  a -- a lake, 

thanks to a dam that they made. We went th
ere as students. We knew that nobody would bother 
us because the village wa s very well organized in 
terms of the resist ance. Th-There -- there was -
- there was active ELAS, which were the partisan
s, and there was reserve ELAS. So there were 
organizations for the me n, for the wome n, everythi
ng was organized. So -- so it was a nice place 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
14 
 
to be. We  brought with us a lot of supplies to 
last us for a year. The problem was that in 
Nove mber, the Germans decided to go on a s
earch and destroy mi ssion, and the -- we were 
notified ahead of time -- the villagers were not 
afraid that anything would happen to them, but 
we -- and in the meantime I should say some  more
 Jews came to -- to th
e village, knowing that 
we were there. There were two me n, and anothe
r three people, a couple and a old ma n who did 
not even know Greek, he was a ship tycoon, Aar
on Roma no, who was speaking in French rather 
than Greek. And so we were -- 
Q: Can I -- can I interrupt for one mo me nt?  

A:  Ce r t a i nl y.  

Q: When you got to the village,
 how did you get a place to stay? 
A: We  rented. We  rented a room. This -- we
 had with us plenty of money. My father 
unfortunately had only cash. He di
d not have any gold, that was a big mi stake, because thanks to 
inflation, the money lost all it™s va
lue within months. So we rented a place, we acted like  tourists. 
We didn™t hide the fact that we 
were Jews. As a ma tter of fac t  we
 were going to the church every 
Sunday because we didn™t want th
e -- the people to think that we
 were different, with the 
exception of the fact that we would not ma ke the sign of the cross, or eat the wafers, or the pi eces 

of bread that y-you know, a -- a Chris
tian is supposed to -- to have 
at the end of the service. So 
with the exception of that, we were very friend
ly with the pr iest, who used to come  to my 
mother™s pl ace because  we were the only ones who 
had coffee, and he like d to have coffee. And 
the life was beautiful, and the 
-- it was li-like a 
vacation, until the Germ
ans came. When they 
came, we -- by now we were f-four of us, and tw
o, six, we were nine -- f
our, seven -- we became 
10 Jews in the village. And we decided, and the 
people of the resi
stance told us that we should 
go higher up, and they told us th
at there is a house very high up in
 the mountain of 300 feet, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
15 
 
you should go there and stay there. 
So there were only two little donkeys that could be used for -- 
for supplies. So we loaded a little donkey, but un-unfortunately we had to
 leave all our supplies 
in the room. And we went to 
the -- to the top of
 the -- of the mountain, to the house of 
[indecipherable] and we stayed there, and the Ge
rmans stayed in the v
illage for -- I -- I should 
add that Mrs. [indecipherable] 
Levy, a socialite from Athens d
ecided she had enough, she wasn™t 
going to go any -- any further, and she stayed in 
the village. And she spoke fluently German and 
French. And she spoke with the German officers 
very, very well, and --
 and n-none of them 
asked her how come  a lady like her ends up in a village like that. And -- 
and it didn™t take long 
and the Germans left, and we came back. When we 
came ba ck, we found out that we lost all our 
supplies. Now, the owner of the house, who has 
a reputation as a thief claime d that it was the 
Germans who took it, who took everything. My moth
er went right into th
eir house and searched 
and she found some  of our items. The -- later on 
we found out when the villagers ma de the report 
as to how -- what things they lo
st, it was ma inly bottles of Ouz
o, bottles of wine, and they would 
say, with the entire bottle. Because for them the 
bottle was mo re precious than the contents of 
Ouzo and wine, which they could ma ke by themselv
es. Therefore, I™m convinced that it was this 
ma n, [indecipherable] who was the thief, and not th
e Germans. But we knew that the partisans, in 
order to establish some  sort of 
tranquility and -- and e-eliminate [indecipherable] and fear, they 
have killed even a partisan who stole a -- a chic
ken. And therefore, we d
ecided to keep quiet, not 
to report him [indecipherable] the 
family. We  wouldn™t want to be 
responsible for an execution. 
And we thought, well, we have mo re supplies in 
Agrinion and we will br ing them. Unfortunately 

we were not able to bring as ma ny s upplies as 
we needed, so we had some starvation later on. 
Now, the fact that Mrs. [indeci
pherable] Levy decided to stay a
nd the Germans were very polite, 
turned against us the following month, because the 
Germans made three attempts at research -- at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
16 
 
search and de stroy operations. In November, in 
December, and in the following August. So, in 
December there was another alarm that the Ge
rmans were approaching. This time, Mrs. 
[indecipherable] Levy persuaded my mother that 
the Germans are not dangerous they behaved so 
well. My mother didn™t like the idea of going up 
to the mountain, but also, she didn™t want to 
abandon our supplies for fear that -- that they wi
ll be stolen again, although we had to change 
rooms because this ma n not only he resented the f
act that we called hi m a thief, especially after 
we found things hidden in his house, but he asked 
us to leave because we insulted hi m.  He didn™t 
realize that we saved his life. A
nd we moved to another room that 
we also rented. So my mother 
decided to -- to help Mrs. [indecipherable] Le
vy in her room, since the knew Ger man so well, 
and -- and stay there. But a neighbor who 
saw that, told the lady -- she was a -- a 
[indecipherable] a forme r  policeman and his son 
was a partisan and he told them, what ma kes 
you believe that there will be the same Germans, or
 they will became -- they 
will be just as polite 
as they were before, or they mi ght not have orde
rs to ar-arrest you as suspicious individuals. So 
she forced them to come up to the mountain lake
 with it, but fortunately the Germans did not 
come this second time in the village. Are you cu
rious about what happened the third time, in 
August? 

Q: We ll, did anything happen in between? 

A: In -- 

Q: Between February and August? 

A: -- in between, with the exception that we f
aced starvation because th
e -- the war between the 
Germans and the partisans intensified, and while before it was so easy to get in and out of 

Agrinion, it became mor e  difficult. So the end re
sult was that -- that it
 was not easy to send a 
villager in the bank where my father had stored
 his supplies and get from a -- one his friends 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
17 
 
there, who was -- he was -- it™s -- 
it™s hard to understand that, but 
the bank was trying to help the 
employees even with food supplies. So one of the rooms in the bank had food, and an employee 
would take care of food distribution to the em
ployees of the bank. So this ma n also had our 
supplies with instructions when my father would 
send a ma n to get whatever we wanted, but this 
source was -- was lost. So we -- we really suffered 
from -- from starvation. I mean, but this is not 
-- this is the least 
that can happen to you. 
Q: But what kinds of things were you able then to
 eat?  This was true of a lot of people in Greece 
at this time , right, that
 this was very bad -- 

A: We ll, not -- not -- not -- it was -- it was 
bad only in Athens, not in the provinces. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The provi -- provinces had 
plenty of food, and people from
 Athens would come  to the 
provinces to get food. In -- in Agrinion, as long 
as we were not [indecipherable] there was no 
problem, it was like peacetime. I me an, you had as much food as you wanted. Only when we lost 
our supplies and we were not ab
le to get the quantit
ies that we needed, only then -- we had 
basically to eat a lot of wild ve
getables. I had -- that was my j
ob. I had to go, with a knife, and 
get anythi ng that was green on the ground, all ov
er the pl ace, that the animals would not eat 
because they were -- these things
 were bitter. And then my moth
er would boil these things and 
mi x the m wi th a little corn flour and she woul
d put just enough oil on th
e -- on the big, big pot, 
and cook them. I found out eventually that this
 cellulose can be absorbed by the body. So 
basically, that™s what kept us alive, because we
 could eat enor mous quantities of these because I 
would get, you know, bi-big quantities and we woul
d eat that. Basically, that ™s what th -- that™s 
what it was. The one thing I can say 
is that at -- what helped us 
at one point was the fact that a 
partisan unit came to stay in the village. And 
we told them that we were starving. And they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
18 
 
offered to de -- I mean, they -- at -- at night, wh
en they had their meetings, all the partisans voted 
in favor of giving us a -- a portion. And also to
 the fa mily of [indecipherable] Levy. And -- and 
when the -- the trumpet would -- would sound, 
I would go in line and get a portion -- the 
partisans were not fed very well either, ma inly 
th-they had a corn soup. That™s -- that wa s -- and 
a few olives. But we would divide that portion th
at was for one ma n, we 
would divide it into 
four. And in this way, w -- for the duration of th
eir s -- their stay in Psilovrahos which was 
ma ybe 20 - 25 days, we did not touch our supplies.
 That proved to be very, very important 
because ultima tely we did not have anything. And 
on that da y, one of the me n of the village -- 
actually he was the leader of th
e reserve ELAS, he -- he told me
 to -- to go and collect berries, 
and by that time  there were berries, as ma ny as
 you wanted. And I did. We ate berries for four 
days and we all became sick. At that point
 we didn™t know what to do because the 
[indecipherable] production was going to come  with
in days, but not in our village, which was on 
the mountain. So my mo ther and 
I took the last supply that we 
had, which was sugar, and we 
went down, we crossed the river of [i ndecipherabl e] and we went to a [i ndecipherable] village of 
a [indecipherable]. And there we exchanged 
sugar, which nobody had, for [indecipherable], 
which was some  cereal that had milk. And that wa
s the turning point in 
-- in our food situation. 
Once the time ca me  tha t  the villages had produc
ed -- had -- had a lot of
 things, i-i-in the 
meanti me  we -- we realized what we had to do, bu
t that™s a little -- it™s
 a little -- another story, 
because we had -- well, where to find parachut e 
material, but this happened accidentally. When e 
-- in April, or at the beg -- at
 the end of March, my mother de
cided that she sh -- would go to 
Agrinion and get supplies. And my father and my
self -- I-I wa s at that time  13 going on 14, my 
sister was only five to six, so my
 father an-and myself told her not
 to go, but she was very str -- 

opinionated and she decided to go. And she walked
 for practically 12 hours to go to Agrinion. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
19 
 
And at one point she had to cross a -- a -- a bridge
, and one of the guards there was a partisan -- a 
Jewish partisan [indecipherable] 
from Arta, that my mother kne
w him. And he told her, don™t 
you know that the -- the -- the Jews have been arre
sted, and they are in 
Agrinion in warehouse of 
Papapetrou? Of course my mother 
did not know anything, but she -- I 
have to say that before that 
my mother was stopped by a -- a teacher of mi ne  w
ho recognized her, and he told her, where are 
you going?  Don™t you know that the Jews have b
een arrested, and in addition, don™t you know 
that the Germans executed some  200 Christian hostages because of the war that take s place 
between the Germans and the partis
ans. And my mother saidthat 
-- of course she felt very bad, 
and sick about -- hearing about the Jews, but sh
e was determined, and she said, I have to go, I 
have to get food. So the -- the teacher said, w
hy don™t you go until the village that is ve ry close 
to -- to Agrinion, and -- and stop 
there at the ma ilbox, and th-this 
is a house of a godfather of 
mi ne, and he is a teacher in the village. You 
tell them that I sent you, and send him to Agrinion 
to get the food. So my mother explained to the part
isan [indecipherable] that this is my plan, and 
I™m not going to go beyond this little village, wh
ich was in the outskirts of Agrinion, and he let 
her go, and that™s what happened. She me t the teac
her. The teacher went 
with his horse to the 
bank. He happened to be a godf -- he was a godfathe
r of the director of the bank -- this is a 
tremendous coincidence considering that [indeci
pherable] is the director of the bank, was 
supposed to be a descenda nt of the families 
which were converted in 1821. Svordis was a 

common Jewish name  in Ioannina. Svordis coul
d have been also one of the -- the convert 
fa milies. And my father claims that even the 
intermediary between the two of them, Zambaris, 
that was the nickname  of the Levy family of Ioan
nina. So, it -- it™s a -- an amazing coincidence 
to have all these three pe ople be
ing godfathers to each other, and been involved in helping my 
mother at this point. Now, when he went to the 
bank with the horse in front of it, the director 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
20 
 
became terrified. I mean th-th- th -- under these 
conditions, ge tting food on a horse that is going 
to go outsi de  of the city, the whole ba nk can be considered guilty of doing some thing wrong, as 
far as the Germans and their collaborators, and there were pl enty by that time. There were the 

security -- Greek security battali
ons active at that time. So the 
only thing we were able to get 
thanks to that expedition was some  quinine and so
me sugar and some tea that coul d be placed in 
the pocket of -- and when the ma n came back, he wa
s not satisfied to leave my mother there, it 
was a-approaching nighttime when neither the 
partisans would allow anybody to move, nor the 
Germans. So he proposed to my mother that they
 should go to sleep in a small church that his 
grandfather had built of prophet Elia. Even that 
to me  is significant. And [indecipherable] went 
and zamp -- Zambaris -- that™s name, Zambaris a
nd my mother spent the night in that little 

church on top of the mountain 
where it was cold, and the wind 
was blowing. Then the following 
day, my mother came back to the village. When s he told us what was -- what happened, o-of 

course she was exhausted, you know, a-after 24 hour
s and -- and the trauma  of knowi ng, a-and -- 
because they made a mi stake and they told her that
 the Jews of Ioannina were also there, which 
means that all our relatives were there. So she wa
s really a wreck. But in spite of that, she wanted 
to go on another expedition in which the British 
mi ssion which was in Priansa. That time  we 
were assured that as soon as the allies woul
d know that the Jews were
 arrested, they would 
imme diately mobilize all their know-how and all 
their means at their disposal and the Jews 
would be s-set free. So again my mot her -- you se
e, my -- my father had some  problems, he had 
some pain with his legs, and he 
couldn™t walk at that time . So 
my mother again, and myself, we 
embarked on an expedition of approxima tely a to
tal of 14 hours of hiki
ng in unknown territory, 
crossing and re-crossing two rivers. That means f
our times crossing rivers to go there. And we 
went to the village of Priansa where we had a 
me eting with a British major who -- his friend, a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
21 
 
a prostitute who was there told us -- well, I-I sh
ould say this, passing on the way there, we had to 
stop in a -- i-in a cont rolled 
partisan point, which was ma nned 
by our banker from Agrini. And 
he told us [indecipherable] we -- we told him 
what was our mi ssion, what
 we wanted to do. And 
he told us to go to this lady. There were othe
r prostitutes there who were so-called working for 
the British mi ssion. And he told us 
that this particular girl wa s th
e girlfriend of the British ma jor, 
but evidently, she was also in cont
act with the resi stance. And he to
ld my mother to go to her and 
she will be able to talk to the 
-- to the major so the major will -- 
would be a little bit better to us. 
But when we went there and we found her, the 
first thing that she did when she saw how I was 
dressed, because I was -- I was wearing my short 
fascist uniform, a blue uniform that it was 
strong ma terial, but because my legs were exposed, my mother had s -- had sewn or attached to 
them some  woolen leggings. So I was dressed like
 that. Soon as she saw that, she gave me  the 
leftover [indecipherable] khaki pair
 of wi -- winter khaki pants th
at she had cut them to make 
shorts out of them, and she gave us the left
over, you know, so my mother can make some -- a 
better pair of pants for me . And she said that sh
e had an argume nt with the ma jor and he was not 
in a good mood. But nevertheless, the -- the m- ma jo
r saw us, and he was very nice, and he knew 
French so my mother spoke to him in French. 
And he promised to send a message to -- to the 
headquarters, and a -- a me ssage to my father™s 
sister who lived at that time in Alexandria, 
Egypt. But we know that the me ssage in Alexandr
ia, Egypt never went. But we were in that 
village, we realized that  the village wa s filled 
with parachut e material because the pl anes were 
comi ng at night and they were dropping weapons 
and ammunition for the resistance. And there 
was plen-plenty of parachute ma terial. So my
 mother went from house to house and she begged 
these villagers, who didn™t know wh
at to do with this ma terial, and 
we collected a lot of material, 
and cord, and everything else. And when we 
came back, my mother, who had an elementary 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
22 
 
knowledge of sewing, she went into the business of 
-- of -- shall I stop?  Ye
s. She went into the 
business of ma king shirts, and we used some  ma t e
rial th-that we brought for ma ttresses, to ma ke 
pants out of them. And e ventually
 she changed these materials by 
going to different villages -- 
villages for years, you know, did not have a
ny material. And we collected enough wheat and 
corn and everything else to last us
 for the next two or three years. 
And but this -- this is the story 
that is related to 
food. I -- I bet -- 
Q: Why don™t we -- why don™t we stop now, sin
ce we™re close to the end of this tape. 
A: Okay. 
Q: And we™ll continue on the next one. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape One 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Mike, why were the Jews of Athe ns going into hiding at that time ?  
A: We  found out about it much
 later. Who -- what happened was this. The Germans asked the 
chief rabbi of Athens, Elia Barzelai to give them 
a list of the Jews of Athe
ns. The rabbi of course 
had -- was given sa -- some  ti me  to prepare the 
list and during that time 
the Jews of Athens, or 
important Jews of Athens found out or they knew about it. And one of them was a -- a Greek 
Jewish journalist, Baruch Schibi, who was one of 
the leaders of resistance in Athens. He was a 
man from Salonica who never intended to be 
in a place where the Germans were, and when the 
Germans we re entering Greece, he attempted to l
eave and go to Egypt, and he reached only Crete 

and then you know whe n the Germans attacked Cret
e with the parachutists
, h -- and he was not 
able to go to Egypt and he retu
rned back to Athens. He knew what happened to Salonica. What 
happened in Salonica was that the leadership with
 Rabbi Koretz proved to 
be very ineffective. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
23 
 
And since the Jews did not know that the Germans 
were killing Jews outside of Greece, they did 
not have the incentive that a hunted animal 
has. And you know, when some body is hunted, the 
instinct of survival of course, 
is you -- to either flee, hide or 
fight. The -- the situation was such 
that although the German intenti
ons towards the Jews of Saloni
ca proved to be bad from the 
beginning, only the wealthy Jews, some  3,400 of 
them took advantage of the fact that up til 
February 1942, they were able to freely and le
gally move from the Bulgarian and German zones 
of occupation and go to the Italia
n zone, where the Italians were
 living very well as I told you 
before. The rema ining Jews in Bulgaria and Mace
donia, and that™s where the great ma jority of 
the Jews were, they did not know what to do. I f
eel they were like children who needed help, and 
nobody was ready to help them. So i n Sal
onica the organization ELAS proposed to the 
community to help, but the leaders of the comm
unity refused this help. The communist party 
proposed to help, and they suggested that the Je
wish children should go to trusted families of the 
party, and the rest of the 
population to be dispersed outside of Sa
lonica as long as it was free and 
legal to do -- to do so. But this proposal was re
jected by the leaders also. So basically, you have 
some  over 50,000 Jews there not having any 
leaders, not knowing what was going on, and 
furthermore, not having Christian fr iends, most 
of them, as a result of anti-Semitism. The 
population in Macedonia and Salonica was either indi
fferent or hostile to the Jews, and the proof 
is that out of over 10,000 Jewish fami lies in Salo
nica, only one fa mily, that of Haim Pardo, of 
five people was offered a shelter in the house of 
Dr. George and Fedra Carracortso right in the 
center of Salonica where they stayed indoors fo
r 18 months. There was some  other 70 Jews who 
were saved in Salonica, but these were ma inly
 husbands, or fiancés of Christians. The -- the 
university, or the other organizatio
ns of Salonica did not protest,
 did not do anything, but some  
lawyers protested to the genera
l governor -- the gene
ral governor Simonides, he said, we are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
24 
 
removing the thorns from your garden, and you ar
e protesting?  The -- the 
one who pleaded with 
the Germans was the bishop of Salonica, Yanadios, who asked them to use ma gnani mity and 
clemency, especially when the time for the deportations came, and he -- he is considered as a 

righteous Gentile. Another protest for whichGreece should be really proud was ma de by the 

archbishop of Greece, Da ma skinos, and it was 
signed by 42 me mbers -- leaders of Greek 
organizations. And in this case, what really 
happened was that the -- 
these people would me et 
periodically to discus
s the problems of the occupation, and one day a Jewish woman from 
Salonica told him what was happening, and the poet [indecipherable] Yanosh wrote the appeal, it 

was signed immediately by all 42, and it was delivere
d to the Germans, an d to the government of 
Greece. The prime mi nister of Greece, Logothetopoul
os, instead of trying to protect the Jews of 
Salonica when they were deported, he confessed th
at he was in favor of the deportations because 
there would be a lot of vacant housing that 
was needed. So, 252 Jewish students from the 
University of Salonica became partisans of 
ELAS, over 600 Jews became partisans of ELAS. 
When the proposals of the communist party were 
rejected, the communists th -- reme mber that 
they had 150 me mbers in their li
sts who were Jews. So they appealed to them to go to the 
mountains. Out of them, 75 decide
d to go, but as they were divi
ded into three groups and they 
were going for the mountains, they thought, and wh
at about our fa milies?  How are we  going to 
let our fami lies be by themselves in exile? A
nd they came back and they surrendered to the 
Germans. Now, Baruch Schibi knew all that, and 
he was afraid that the same  thing wa s going to 
be repeated in Athens. So he conceived the pl
an of abducting or kil
ling Ra bbi Barzelai of 
Athens. The other leaders of the resist ance agreed 
with his plan, and they went to the rabbi and 
they told him. Rabbi was ready, he said I™m -- 
do anything you want with me . And they took him 
and his fami ly and they moved them to the m
ountains. When the word went around, the Jews of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
25 
 
Athens disappeared. However, th
ere were poor Jews who at the 
beginning they thought they 
would hide too, but they needed to work. And they 
started going into the -- in
to the -- th -- to the 
Germans, and the Germans kindly extended thei
r deadline and allowed all of the Jews who 
would come  slowly [indecipherable] they would come  and the -- the Germans wouldn™t do 
anything to them more, they would come  -- this
 was noticed by none othe
r than an American 
consul general who was operatingfrom Istanbul. And in the state 
department where there are 500 
pages of documents sent from Consul  Berr
y, Brigadier General Tindall, and Ambassador 
Makvay of [indecipherable] 500 pages. In one of 
them this situation is
 noticed by a b -- a -- 
Burton Berry, who s -- who tells th
e state departme nt that -- that we need a little financ ial 
assistance here because the poor Jews are repor
ting and now they tell th
em that they should 
report within a 15 mi nute interval, which means that the Germans want to arrest  them within that  

15 mi nute interval. All these repo
rts were ignored, and filed in 
the archives, where I found them 
in 1975. Eventually 1,000 Jews of Athens were
 registered. But things became  nice again. 
Everything was normal up til March of -- 25
th
 of March 1944. That was the time that the Jews of 
Ioannina [indecipherable] that my mother was su
pposed to -- t-to find in
 Agrinion if she went 
there, were all arrested. And the -- a- and -- a
nd Burton Berry in another document says, didn™t I 

tell you that this was going to happen?  And -- an
d he gave other warnings. Actually, the most 
important warning that he gave was the fo
llowing. There was a -- a -- a Greek Christian 

me rchant, Michael [indecipherable]
 who, a-as I said before, busi
ness was as normal as it could 
be in Greece. He went on business, he was a 
tobacco me rchant, and he was going on business to 
Istanbul. In his train compartment -- evidently he was traveling fi rst cl ass, he started a 

conversation with three German SS
 officers, who told him point bl
ank that we are going to stop 
here in Larisa  because we  are on our way to Corfu, where we will deport all the Jews of Corfu. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
26 
 
In other words, the Germans were so sure th
at nobody cared, especially
 a Christian me rchant, 
that they told him a military secret. Now, th
is man was a good ma n. As soon as he went to 
Istanbul, he went straight to 
the American consul -- consul ate,
 and he told Burton Berry what 
was happening. Burton Berry imme diately notifie
d the state departme nt, and again nothing 
happened, although it was so easy to ma ke a radi
o contact with the Br
itish military missions. 
British military mi ssions had contact with the resi
stance, which existed in all the cities, not to 
me ntion secret American and British agents wh
ich operated in Greece. All of these pe ople coul d 
have notified the Jews and tell them what washappening. It took -- fr -- fr om these reports, it 
took until June ninth, the Jews of
 Corfu were arrested. In the Ge
rman archives, even the German 
commander of Corfu send a report to his superiors,
 a lengthy report in which he was trying to tell 
them that there is no need to do anything to
wards the Jews, they have never bothered us. 
Evidently he -- he said, we don™t have any mean
s of transportation, why don™t you arrest the -- 
the It alian soldiers of Bertolio
 who are -- are danger
ous?  Th-The Jews never bothered us. Out of 
2,000 Jews, only 187 returned from t he camps. So th
is is the -- the -- the 
story with the -- the 
state depart -- and the American -- American 
governme nt. Now, Baruch Schibi continued his 
activities as a -- a leader of the resist ance,
 and he was responsible for the mili-military 
intelligence during certain batt
les in the [indecipherable] where hundreds of Ger mans are 
working. 

Q: A few mi nutes ago you me nti
oned your sister for the first 
time. How ol d was your sister? 
A: She was born in 1938, so at that time 
she was no more than five going on six. 
Q: Wa s this a hard time  for her, because she was 
really such a -- she was, what, four years old in 
f -- 1943 -- five years old?

A: Yes, well, life in the villages 
I told you was a beautiful
 life, and the life we had in the city was 
a beautiful life, with the exception of the -- of fe
w months that we had this starvation. But we 
were not really hungry, thanks to th
ese vegetables that we were -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- eating. Only in retrospect we
 realized how bad the situation was. Basically, with only the f -
- the four days of eating 
berries were difficult.  
Q: What™s her name? 

A: Minetta, and she™s a t -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Minetta Feldman, she™s marri
ed, and she™s living in Bethes
da and she™s a teacher.  
Q: And your mother -- it seems as 
if prior to this pe
riod of time  you -- you have a -- a rather 
privileged life, and your mother is not necessar
ily doing the necessities in the home. But when 
you go to the village, she ha
s to transfor m herself. Wa s this difficult for her?   
A: We ll, actually, in Greece, even
 if you had the ma id, or even 
had a cleaning woma n, still you -- 
you have to do -- to do things that were -- you didn™
t have the facilities th
at you have now, so she 
was working very hard in the house like ever
yone else. She was not a 
-- a lady of leisure. 
Q: You -- you say in your -- in your book that sh
e was teaching the village women e mbroidery 
and sewing, is that -- 

A: Yes, sh-she -- she did that. She had a lot of
 friendships with the -- with the wome n. And 
talking about my sister, she -- 
I don™t think she understood th
at the situation was bad. She 
enrolled in the village school. I ma de a book fo
r her, you know, by copying another book. I used 
a little basin as a boat in one of the 
ponds there. She -- she never complained. 
Q: We re you going to school there in the village as well, or not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
28 
 
A: No, no -- 
Q: No. 

A: -- there was only an elementary school of four
 years, you know. I -- and 
I -- actually I took all 
the schoolbooks with me  and I 
confess -- confess that I did no
t open them even once, although I 
consider that year as the -- the most formative 
and important year of my l i fe. And -- and actually 

when we came back from the village -- we le
ft on October third, 1943, I came back on October 
third or fourth of 1944. I wrote down all the me mories
 of that year and I entitled it, ﬁOne Year in 
the Mountains,ﬂ and I gave it to my t eacher of litera
ture to see it. He kept it for six months in hi s 
drawer, and he gave it back to me  without ma
king any comme nt. I gave it to my father. He 

looked at it, and he ma de  a hi
ding place under the -- the heavy di
ning room table. Wh y?  Because 
I loved the partisans, and I loved their songs. A
nd imme diately after the wa r, what happened in 
Greece is this, Greece is the only country in Euro
pe where those who fought the Germans lost 
their jobs, they -- after the war, they lost thei
r jobs, they were imprisoned, they were exiled, or 
they were executed. Not all of them of course
, you know, but -- but -- but most of them. Maybe I 
shouldn™t say most of them, but -- but a great number of -- of the resistance fighters suffered this 

-- this fate. As a matter of fact, there -- ther
e were even some  Jewish partisans who were 

executed, and one of them, the most important Je
wish -- Greek Jewish partisans, who was an 
expert in agriculture, Lazarus Azarias, he wa
s a brilliant ma n and a highly organized person, and 
he was in charge of supplies for the resistance. A
nd he was so effective in hi -- in this job, that 
imme diately after the war the Greek governme nt 
condemned him to death in abstentia because 
he ma naged to escape and go to Israel, where he 
became eventually, the direct or of Nuva, which 
is one conglome rate dealing with produce. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
29 
 
Q: And why did this happen?  What -- why was this response to the pa
rtisans?  Wa s it only ELAS 
that they were
 responding to? 
A: Yes, not ELAS, ELAS was the right wing 
partisans, they didn™t bother them. And 
[i ndeci pherabl e] my fat h er™s fi rst  cousi n  was a --
 a doctor who was an offi
cer in --  in ELAS, a 
me dical offi cer. What happened was 
that e -- that Churchill and Sta
lin divided parts of Europe in 
zones of influence. And the -- that Greece was part 
of the British zone of influence. So when the 
war ended, the -- the British w-were afraid that
 the -- the army of -- a -- of ELAS, whi c h had 
communist leaders, they were afra
id that they mi ght take over, so what they -- what they did is 
they -- they landed troops in Greec
e but th-they needed 
allies who would be th
eir natural al lies. 
But the former German corroborators who were in
 the security battalions, and the provincial 
police which also collaborated with the Germans,
 and I don™t know about th
e police in -- in -- in 
Athens because the leaders of the police were
 [indecipherable] and Evert are considered 
righteous Gentiles because they issued false iden
tity cards for ma ny Jews. But the fact is that  all 
these groups were, incl uding the -- especially in
cluding the German collaborators, they were the 
force that took over in Gr eece, and 
-- and therefore, anyone who ha
d to do -- anythi ng to do with 
the resi st ance became a -- a communi st suspect,
 including me . What actually happened with me  
is that when I graduated from hi
gh school at the age of 17, I needed
 a -- a special police permit to 
go to Athens to -- to take the entrance exams fo
r the school, for the univer
sity. So I went to the 
police to --  to take the -- the pe
rmit, and to my sur prise, they re
fused it. So, I said I wanted to 
speak to the chief of the poli
ce. I went to his office, and 
he was sitting ther e with the 
[i ndecipherable] who I knew he was a German collaborator, and the leader  of the paramilitary 

fascist organization, X. I didn™t lik
e that, but I told the chief of 
the police, why don™t I get the -- 
the permit?  And he remi nded me  of the fact that
 I was in the mountains. I know I was in trouble 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
30 
 
already and there was no need to ex -- no use to 
explain to them that I was a Jew, most  probably 
they knew that already. But by that time  I had b
ecome  streetwise, so to speak, and I reme mbered 
that my high school principal had been arrested 
by the partisans as soon as they moved into 
Agrinion because he was -- he was an eloquent 
speaker, and he extolled and asked the Greek 
youth to imitate the German youth in the fight ag
ainst the evil forces of the allies. So the 
partisans put him in prison together with [i
ndecipherable] and ma ny, 
many others. And the 
British released them from prison. So, I also kne
w that I was one of his best  student s in his 
subjects, Latin, ancient Greek and modern Gree
k. And so I told the chief of the police, I 
understand that you don™t know anything about me
. The onl y thing -- the only one who knows 
me  is my hi gh school principal, because I™ve 
be en a student  up til now. Was, you know, 17. The 
two of them looked at each other and smiled, and 
the chief replied, if you bring us a paper from 

the -- from Mr. [indecipherable] who they knew 
very well, you have no problem. So I went 
straight to his house because he was sick in 
bed, and I told him what happened, and he  became 
furious. He immediately dictated a-- a letter to his son who was th
ere, and he -- but this was a 
serious business. This wa s not, you know, just a le
tter, he asked him to go to the high school and 

ask a specific professor to have this typed, and 
-- and have it stamped, and -- and return it to him 
for his signature, and then take it to the police. 
And I reme mb er that he wa s ending his letter of 
recommendation by saying that I have
 nationalist feelings and Chri
stian ethics, although this ma n 
knew perfectly well that  I was a Jew. So this is
 my experience after th
e war as a -- as a ma n 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Did your -- your father work for ELAS, the -- 

A: My -- my  father -- in the village as I show
 -- I told you, everything wa
s very well organized, it 
was -- it wa -- all the branches of the resist ance
 were represented. My fa
ther, since he was a bank 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
31 
 
employee, they asked him to be the -- in ch
arge of ETA, which was the provisions for the 
partisans. Now, the village was extremely poor, and 
the provisions that my father collected were 
insignificant, but still my father officially, he wa
s the repr esentative of ETA in the village. When 
we came to Agrinion, the Germans had left enorm
ous warehouses filled with supplies, which had 
not been able to take  with them whe n they 
were abandoning Greece. So the partisans occupied 
all these tremendous warehouses of [indecipherable]
. I reme mber they were filled to capacity 
with things. And they asked my father if he w
ould like to be the director. My father was so 
grateful to the partisans, he -- he
 did. So he was the director of 
the warehouses until the partisan 
army was de stroyed, which was ma ybe thre
e -- three or four months later.  
Q: So go -- go back to your being in the mount
ains in that last push by the Germans in the 
summer of ™ 44. 

A: In August. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: In August of 1944, this time the -- some  -- a 
s -- a column of -- a 
column of 600 German 
troops, assisted by tanks and mountai
n artillery advanced again thr
ough this particular road that 
we said [indecipherable] and then at that point,
 the partisans this time 
ordered the evacuation of 
all the villages in the area. So this third time that 
was the mos t  serious out of the all three time s, I 
was feeling very happy, because this was the first 
time that it was not only we the Jews who had 
to leave the village and go to 
the top of the mountain, but everybody had to do it. So sure 
enough, the whole village was evacuated. We  we nt
 to a plateau overlooking the river and the 
villages below, and -- 
Q: And how many -- how many people? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
32 
 
A: In the village?  Over 300. With their animals 
and everything we went to this plateau and at 
that point the teacher of the villa
ge approached my father and he 
said, if a German patrol comes 
here, they might arrest you and me  a nd take us
 as hostages. So we better go and find -- I me an, 
actually he found a -- a good hiding pl ace, away fr om 
the rest of the villagers. So we went with 
him and we found ourselves in a sort of a balcony, which was covered with a -- the branches of a 
tree. A balcony with a ma gnificent 
view of the river below, and 
the villages of Apiscope and -- 
and Psilovrahos. And I was able to see from a di
stance the column like -- 
like ants, it looked, the 
soldiers mo ving. And then what happened was that the partisans attacked the Germans. And a 

ferocious battle took place for almost an hour.And then, when the German artillery started 

firing, then we knew the situation was really bad. 
But the partisans, when the artillery started 
firing, they withdrew, and it became
 quiet again. And that was the 
time that the -- the little ants 
that we saw before started -- st
arting at different hous
es and then smoke would be comi ng from 
these houses. They were burning th
e house -- the houses of the vill
age of Apiscope. We did not 
see them, they did not have a chance to -- to bur
n our village, but we -- 
but they -- they left  
within a couple of days. 

Q: And then you returned back to -- 

A: Then we came back to the village where we 
found all our supplies intact
 because there was -- 
Mr. [indecipherable] was not there 
to take care of us again. 
Q: And then what happened, was that the -- close to the end? 

A: Yeah, August, this was August sixth, and th
e Germans started withdrawing by the end of 
September, and -- and at the beginning of Oc
tober we were back wh
ere we were before. 
Q: In Agrinion. 

A: In Agrinion. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
33 
 
Q: And wha t  was that like, to return to Agrinion? 
A: I had a -- I reme mber that I was expecting 
that I was going to be very happy, you know, to 
come  into a free city. It -- it wa
s a sort of a disappointme nt, I --
 I was not as happy as I expected 
to be, especially knowing -- wedidn™t know what was happening to
 our relatives, and we were 
afraid that maybe my grandparents we re too old 
to survive, you know, all this transportation, and 

that, but we never expected to see what really ha ppened. 

Q: And wha t  did you see? 

A: I™m sorry? 

Q: What did you see? 

A: We  -- we saw nothing, I mean, the city was the same  way like it was before, and only when I 

went to Ioannina and saw the -- th
ere was none of the people that we were -- w-we used to -- to 
have there, that were na -- there, only then I started wondering why all this happened. I had ma ny 

questions that I had in my -- my mi nd. Questi
on number one would be 
why such a thing would 
happen. And the -- my -- my answer was in one 
word, anti-Semitism. In two words would be 
religious anti-Semitism. And I™m very much -- ve
ry fa miliar with the -- the church teachings. I 
know exactly what they say, especi
ally during the -- the holy week. 
And if -- if you have in -- in 
the church, young children who are e
xposed to the beautiful picture of Jesus Christ and then you 
love this person, and then all of a sudden you find 
out that it was the Jews who -- who killed him,  
I mean, how would you feel?  It™s [indecipherable] lik
e I faced that when I was in the village, and 
on Good Friday we were in the church, and the -- 
and the priest did whatev
er he had to do. When 
he came for a coffee to my parents. he apologize
d. And he said, I -- I™m sorry I had to say so 
ma ny things -- because that™s in Greek, we can 
understand, that™s not in
 Latin. And, I™m sorry I 
had to say all these things, but you understand, th
at™s my job. My parents, of course, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
34 
 
understood. And the following day I 
saw a little boy, ma ybe no more th
an five, who I used to be 
his hero, and he used to follow me  around all the 
time. And he looked at me  with suspicion and 
some sort of hate. So I told him, why, what
 -- what ™s wrong? And he said, ﬁYou killed Jesus 
Christ.ﬂ And I will ne ver forget that. That w
ould be my question number one. The -- the second 
question would be when did the allies know about 
all this?  I was under the 
impression that they 
didn't know. That™s the reason my mo
ther and I were eating that ve
getable pie. We  -- we -- we 
walked for 14 hours. Wh at I found out is that th
e British ha d broken the ol der police code of the 
Germans as early as 1939. And th
is older police was the one that
 was in charge of the Jews. 
There are docume nts which prove that they knew 
exactly when a German unit would sa y, arrest 
100 Jews in Paris, who was th
e leader of the gr
oup, how ma ny me n he had under his command, 
where did he stop on his way to -- to Auschwitz, 
or there were killing grounds even in -- in 
Minsk. And they -- they documented all that by 
simply following these radio transmissions. So 
all this -- all this was known. The -- the Americ
ans, up til the time that Germany declared war 
against the United States, they had embassies and 
consulates all over the place. They had secret 
agents every -- everywhere. The documents -- I 
-- I checked only the 500 docume nts that were 
related to Greece, they knew exactly everythi ng 
to the point  that rather than interviewi ng 

survivors when I wanted to -- to find what was 
going on, I preferred to read
 the -- the reports of 
Burton Berry. He was a far more elo
quent writer than any of these 
survivors. So they knew what 
was going on. And then the third question is, w
hy didn™t they do anythi
ng?  And again, the 
answer comes in these words, religious anti-S
emitism. Even in the United States, there was 
discrimi nation against the Jews in
 terms of e mployment, and the -- 
the real histor
ians know now 
that the state departme nt not onl
y blocked immi gration, blocked information, they even tried to 
cover it up to the point that the -- 
that the -- that the secretary of 
the treasury sent a report saying 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
35 
 
acqui -- acquiescence of the United States to the 
murder of the Jews of [indecipherable]. That™s 
serious stuff, ac-acquiescence. And then you ha
ve other people who, like Professor David 
Wyma n, who says that I, as a Ch
ristian, he says he -- he™s appa
lled that the churches did not do 
anything and they rema ined silent in the United St
ates. Let alone the Vatican, let alone all the -- 
the bishops of all Germa ny. So this is the -- th
e old story. But I have to say another thing, that 
like I mentioned before, the Jewish contributi
on, the Greek je -- military Je wish contribution 
with Colonel Frizis. And this was very impor
tant and Greece has to be very proud of that 
because the action of the Greek army delayed th
e German attack against Russia by si x crucial 
weeks. The Germans were forced to fight a wint
er war in Russia, which wa s -- had disastrous 
consequences for the Germans. So this I would say is the di rect contribution of Greece, indirect 

contribution of -- of Colonel Frizis since he wa
s the first one who stopped 
the Italians and then 
advanced as -- ahead of his troops, although he was 
killed later, but this 
was a great contribution. 
Then you have all the Jews who fought in the Br
itish forces, including I would say the son of the 
first president of Israel, Haim Weitzma n, who wa
s shot down over the Br itish channel. And then 
there were 550,000 Ame r ican Jews who served in th
e arme d forces of the United States. In other 
words, when we asked, why didn™t the allies help
?  I say, this is not a cas
e of benevolence, or a 
case of -- of charity, the Jews earne
d and deserved the right to be 
assisted. Not only that, let™s not 
forget that if America became a nuclear power
, which guaranteed American supremacy, it was 
because of Jewish men like Einstein, Oppenheimer
, Ziller, Teller, Rabbe, while the relatives of 
these Jewish me n were dying in the gas chambe
rs of Auschwi t z and Treblinka. Personally, I 
believe that it was wrong, unfair, 
ungrateful and shame ful for the 
United States and Great Britain 
to abandon the Jews and let them die the way they did.  

Q: What about the Greek populati
on during this period of time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
36 
 
A: The Greek population in -- the great ma jority of
 the Jews were in Salonica, and -- in -- in 
northern -- northern mass -- massa -- in Macedon
ia and -- and [indecipherable] and northern 
Greece. The population there was far more anti-Sem
itic than the enlight ened people of Athens. 
And as I said before, only one fa mily out of 10,000 fa mil -- families was offered asylum. That 
tells, as far as I™m concerned, plenty. Many be
lieved that it was not 
easy to -- to go to the 
mountains in -- in -- in Macedonia,
 that the resistance was very w
eak in 1943. But there is a story 
that I sent for publication to the 
journal of Hellenic Diaspora, and 
that™s the story of a friend of 
mi ne, Dr. Joseph Struncis from Veria. And in 
this story you see how his father, who was the 
president of the Jewish community of Veria, he
 didn™t know what to do, 
like everybody else. He 
contacted this -- this horr ible Jewi
sh leader, Rabbi Koretz, and he -- 
Q: Could you just stop for one mo ment?  What -- 
are we o -- are we okay?  Yeah. [indecipherable] 
okay. 

A: He contacted Rabbi Koretz, and 
he tried to reassure hi m that 
everything would be alright, that 
the Jews of Poland -- I mean, accept the deportati
on, the Jews of Poland has -- have  houses for us 
and jobs and everythi ng will be alright, there™
s nothing to worry about. But -- but he was not 

satisfied, so he went to the chief of the police of
 Veria, Stavridis, and 
that™s another righteous 
Gentile that I would like to add into -- into my
 list of -- of the 12 or 13. And -- and he told him 
not to listen to the rabbi, not 
to trust the Germans, just go to
 the mountains. Now, to see how 
easy it was to go to the mountains, my friend had 
a senile 85 year old grandmother, and they 

were not going to leave her behind. So, they en
ded up w-with her on a horse and they had to 
cross a river with a raft. The raft was very sma
ll. She was on the horse, she could not see the raft. 
She moved to the other side of the river, and for 
the rest of her life she was talking about how -- 
about the mi racle that took place like in the time 
in Moses, that the waters parted, and she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
37 
 
passed. And it would have been done, 
that™s -- that™s exactly the point
 that I want -- I -- I want to 
say, but you had to have some  Christian friends, 
because the Christians knew far better as to 
what -- what had to be done. In addition to that
, it was the Christians and not the Jews who had 
friends and trusted relatives in the remote mount
ains of Greece, where 
there were hundreds of 
villages. Wh y they were in s-such inhospitabl e pl
aces, where they had to -- to cultivate things 
from terraces, because during 400 years of horri
bl e Turkish occupation, that™s where they had 
their freedom. And they would have sent -- w
ho -- you see, when the leader of the communist 
party was talking about sending them, dispensing th
em to -- to our side, he knew what he was 
talking about. But the Jewish leaders wouldn™t 
want to have anything to do with some body like 
him, and all -- all ri -- so were waiting to see wh
at  thei r -- what -- they were waiting for whom? I 
me -- believe there was Koretz who was collaborating with the Germans. 

Q: You would say that Kore
tz collaborated? Y
ou would use a strong word like that? 
A: I -- well, I would say this, he was not a ba
d man. His wife , Gitta Koretz send me  a 48 page 
letter in which she was trying to -- to -- to just
ify his actions, that he 
was an intellect ual who 
knew t -- 12 languages, who -- who had a Ph.D. in or
iental studies, who coul
d have left Salonica 
and go with the ma yor of Athens, who invited h
im to leave and go to Egypt, and he didn't want 
to do that. It™s possible that he thought that it wa
s only a deportation, I -- I can
™t tell. But if I were 
there, I -- and -- and I saw what the German
s we re doing, especially when the Germans as-
assembled in -- in July of 1943. The y assembled 9,000 Jewish me n age 15 to 45, and they 

humiliated them, they tortured them, they -- and -- 
and then they started forming slave battalions 

in -- wh-which had to work under inhuma ne conditions. That was the time when there was free -- 

I mean, it was e -- it was legal, and they were fr ee
 to move, to go to the Italian zone, or go to 
these remote mountains, provided of course, they
 had the proper connec
tions with -- with the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
38 
 
Greek villagers. And that™s what was mi ssi
ng, since they did now know what was going to 
happen. But wh-wh-why do -- should th
ey accept deportation? I mean, 
isn™t it better to be free?  
And think of all the tons of gold and precious 
items and supplies which were looted by the 
Germans and their collaborators. Can you imagine 
if all this gold and supplies would have come  
to the resistance?  And let™s think of how much 
the -- the Jews would have contributed to that 
resistance, because we ha d thousands of me n 
who were experienced fighters from the war 
against Turkey in ™21 and ™
22, and the war, the second Worl
d War. You have experienced 
fighters who would never surrender, because any 
Jewish partisan who would be captured by the 
Germans would be executed. So you would have a-- a great contribution 
to the allied effort. 
What a -- a -- a waste of -- of 
-- of manpower, and a-as a former military officer, I can say this, I 
reme mber the -- a poem by Haim Nachman Biali
k, who said -- but it was 
related to something 
else, but the words are very appr
opriate. Great -- gr eat is the sorrow, and just as great is the 
shame. And I ask you, oh son of ma n, which is 
gr eater?  The grandsons of the Maccabeans went 
to their death like lambs , wherever they were f
ound. And to see what some  of these grandsons of 
the Maccabeans could do, I will tell you some thi
ng about the -- perhaps the greatest partisan 
victor y of the second World Wa r, which took pl
ace on May sixth, 1944. I said before there were 
thousands of Greek traitors who were not punish
ed after the wa r. There was a group of five 
Jewish families from Larisa, who establishe d 
a camp on the slopes of Mount Olympus. They 
were betrayed, and an s -- n-s-- SS battalion went one morning a
nd captured them. Three Jewish 
me n atte mpted to escape, and they were killed. 
The f -- a fourth ma n was able to escape and 
notified a nearby partisan unit of ELAS, which 
included Jewi sh fighters, like the legendary 
platoon leader, Marko Ca rasso, and even a cousin 
of mi ne who was a -- a teacher of literature, 
Joseph Matsas. 150 partisans ambushed the Germans. The terrain was perfect for an ambush.

The battle lasted for around six hours. German pl anes came to help the Ge rmans but they were 
ineffective. The Jews eventually were liber
ated. There were 150 German dead, 78 wounded, and 
14 taken prisoners, including one who was the son of
 the German general of the Aegean. He sent 
a me ssage that he would release 200 hostages that 
he had for his son, but 
the me ssage arrived too 
late. The partisans executed the 78 wounded, and 
the 14 prisoners for a total of 242 German 
dead. And the Germans never again attempted to 
go to the mountains to capture fugitive Jews. 
Partisan losses were eight dead, and 10 wounde
d. I have the name s of the eight dead, and I 
believe  they should be considered as righteous Ge
ntiles, because they could very easily have said 
we don™t want to try to save the Jews. So far,I mean, this can show you what the partisans could 

have done. 

Q: Do you think the Jews of Greece in 1943 knew what was happening in Europe, in eastern 

Europe?   

A: There was, until the end of the war, there wa
s not even one Jew in Greece who knew anything 
about the Holocaust or about the fact that th
e Germans were killing Jews. Not a single thing. 
Why?  Because the Germans had t-total secrecy. As
 a matter of fact, Professor Breitman mentions 
that the Germans attemp ted to -- to keep this secr
et from -- especially the Jews, but also from the 
outside world and the German people. They were 
successful in deceivi ng the Jews, but they were 
unsuccessful in keeping it secret from the outsi
de world or the German
 people. In Greece not 
even one Jew knew anything. The first time that
 we understood what was going on was in the 
movies when we saw Eisenhower visiting the co
ncentration camps. If we knew what was going 
on, there are survivors who say that under no circ
umstances would they have entered the trains 
or the trucks. Who woul d do that, to
 -- to -- to take his --  his child
ren, his wife, his parents, in an 
orderly fashion to the trains that 
led them to -- to -- to the --  to the deat h camps. As a matter of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
40 
 
fact there have been cases like 
I me ntioned before the -- the 75 
Jewish communists who returned 
to follow thei r families and there are two cousins 
of my father fr om Ioannina who were also on 
business on the day of the arrest, and they returned 
to Ioanni na to be with their families in exile, 
and they never came back. Nobody knew. 
Q: So what was the difference between your family, who decided not to sta
y, not to register, to 

leave, and those who decided to stay? How 
would you distinguish between you, since you didn™t 
know either -- 

A: Is this the -- 

Q: -- you didn™t -- your fa mily didn™
t know either, what was happening. 

A: This is correct, but we  had connections. In 
other words, we had the right wing friend who -- 
who told us where to go. We  had the left wing friend who told us come  to our house and we will 

send you out. If we didn't  have these two people, we
 would have, if nothing else, procrastinated. 
Two days after we left on October third, two Ge
rmans appeared in the bank, and they asked for 
my father. Now, if we judge as to this visit fr
om what happened in other cities, my assumption is 
that my father was going to be a hostage of 
the Germans, and if he were a hostage of the 
Germans, my mother would never have left him to
 -- a-and go to the mountains, even if we were 
allowed to do that. And -- and another thing is th
is, we left before the order for registration came . 
We did not know there was going to be any order 
for registration. We  left only because we heard 
that the Jews  of Athens went into hiding, we 
didn™t know why. We  simpl y -- we were simply 
determined not to obey any German
 orders, that was our only -- but 
we had friends. This is the -- 
the -- the problem that I -- I see 
with all the Jews. They did no
t have any friends, they didn™t 
know what to do. If you have people around the 
neighborhood who -- who are glad that these 
things happen to you, and they ar
e eag -- they are eagerly waiti
ng to see what kind of looting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
41 
 
they are going to do, and there was 
extensive looting in every city
 where there were Jews, they 
are eager to see their competitors being de
molished, how in the world do you expect any 
assistance from these people?  And considering that
 -- that the Jews did 
not know that deportation 
meant anything but deportation, and -- and having 
leaders who could not r
eally lead them, and 
not having any good advice by their fr iends, they 
were waiting. Now, onc e you are registered, 
the story changes. Then what you do is dangerous if you try to leave. Of course, the friend of -- 
of Veria, with the 85 year old mother, left while
 they were registered, 
and while they had the 
yellow star, and my friend said that as soon as he 
was in free territory, they took the star and they 
threw it to -- to the gr ound. But it took much more
 bravery on their part 
to do it. That™s why the 
most important thing in Greece is that the -- the 
deportations started very
 late, in March of 1943. 
The Jews of Poland were already dead. The Wa rs
aw ghetto uprising was ta
king place at the exact 
same  mo me nt, around March, April, 1943. Up til that
 time , the Jews of Greece had plenty of 
time to disappear and dissolve, you know, in -- in
to eight million Greeks in a remote -- in 
[indecipherable] mountains, whereas
 I told you, the Germans had to
 mount expeditions including 
600 me n, that -- that was not easy. And even if th
ey did, where could they go the -- since there 
were no roads, and -- and there were impenetrable
 forests and -- and terrib -- terrible mountains 
and -- and -- and unknown parts. Plus, there were th
e pa rtisans there. Sothe situation in Greece 

was great for the Jews to -- to -- 
to escape. In addition to that th
e -- the Jews would have gone to 
Turkey, because the partisan organization, the na
val branch of the partisan organization called 
ELAN had formed a -- in -- in agreement with
 the Jewish defense force Haganah, they 
transferred some  1500 Jews from Gre ece to Turkey 
and from there to Palestine. Even the prime 
mi nister of Greece, Geor ge Papandreo used this 
me thod of e scape from Greece. So there was this 
in addition. I believe since there were so ma ny tr
aitors, including six Jewi
sh traitors, and I -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
42 
 
would like to -- to me ntion some thing about them, 
too. I me an, we were not innocent, we had six 
Jewish traitors, all in collaboration with the Germ
ans. So the -- since there were so ma ny traitors 
in the city, so I would say the approximately 6,000 Jews of Greece who were save d, were save d 
either by going to the free partisan controlled areas,
 and -- or  they stayed w
ith -- in that work of 
resistance sympathizers in Athens who volunteere
d their services, and there are no case s where 
the [indecipherable] for example, they w -- they
 were appointed to go into the house for one 
man, but the -- the -- well, i -- this is a case wher
e it shows how the Italians were very helpful in 
Salonica, where they saved hundreds of Jews by gi
ving them Italian citizenship, and they moved 
them to -- to Athens. But in the case of the [ind
ecipherable], what they did was they acted as if 
they were prisoners of the Italians who were going 
to be judged in an Ita
lian court in Athens. So 
they were taken to the Italian z
one, and then to At hens, but the 
Italian soldiers knew the address 
where the resistance told them to go. They di
 -- because these people did not know anybody in 
Athens. How could you go to Athens unless you know some body?  So the 
resistance provided a 
place for them. So the Italian soldiers went to
 the house, and they said, do you know some thing?  
We went to our commander, and we told him th
at we brung -- brought the 
prisoners here, but he 
said where are the prisoners and we couldn™t 
produce you, so how about if you give us some  
money?  So the SS were afraid of blackmail on the 
part of the Italian sold
iers. They gave them 
some  money and then they notifie
d the resistance they were to 
leave this house. And sure enough 
the resistance says all right, you go to that house. 
Went to that house, and -- and they stayed in 
that house until the end of the war, reading Mr
. [i ndecipherable] all the books that he  found 

there, teaching French the grandchildren of 
the -- of the me n, and the ma n was very proud 
because he saved, he said, a -- a 
British soldier, a communist and 
now a -- a j -- a -- a couple of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
43 
 
Jews. So it™s -- it™s a combination. You had 
to know some body, which --what [indecipherable] 
the poor Jews of Salonica, there was a lot of
 poverty in Salonica, they did not know anybody. 
Q: We ™ll have to stop now.  
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Mike, can you tell me about the -- the days
 that you were writing your me moir after you got 
back from the mountains and what happened to that me moir? 
A: I was a -- I was only 14 at that time, and 
since I felt that this was like a -- writing a 
composition, I gave it to my -- 

Q: No wait, how long did it take you to wr
ite it, or how -- when
 did you write it?   
A: As soon as we came back from the mountains, 
this was October fourth 
or fifth of 1944, and it 
must have taken me  two or thre
e months to --  to wr ite it. 
Q: How long was it? 

A: It -- it had at least wa -- 150 pages. It was 
handwritten. And so I gave it to my teacher of 
literature, I -- I was pretty good in -- in composition 
at that time, and he was very glad to see that 
one of his students wrote some thing that looked li
ke a novel. The title wa
s, ﬁOne Year in the 
Mountains.ﬂ So he was very glad, but I wil -- 
I was waiting and waiting, six months later he gave 
it back to me. I asked him what 
was his opinion. He -- he said, ju
 -- ju -- just take it, you know, I 
-- I -- I -- he did not even reply as
 to whether he read it or not. 
So I went home  and I told my 
parents, this is my ma nus cript, I 
gave it to Mr. Papachristos and he 
gave it back to me . My father 
took a look, he -- he saw partisan songs there, at
 the time that the -- everything was going bad for 
the former partisans, so he was very handy a
nd he ma de a hiding plac
e under the -- the dining 
room table. It rema ined there, we forgot 
about it, from 1945 til 1963 when my parents were 
going to come  to the United States and they were 
getting rid of their furniture because they were 
going to rent the house in Athens. At that time  my
 father didn™t know what
 to do with this. He 
was afraid that the Greek custom officials would 
see it, or the American 
custom officials would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
45 
 
see it, and what would they say, so he burned it
 without asking my permiss i on for it. There was 
nothing there that would have disturbed 
neither the Greeks nor the Americans. 
Q: And how come  you didn™t take it with 
you when you came  to the United States? 
A: We  forgot all about it, I didn™
t think anything of it, it™s -- th
is was -- I had other priorities you 
know, and we didn™t ev
en talk about it. 
Q: So once your father put 
it away, no one else saw it? 
A: No. 

Q: Did your mother read it also? 

A: I didn™t think she was interested. 

Q: And wha t  did your father think of it? 

A: My father th-thought that 
this was terrible ma terial to write at that time .  
Q: So were you angry at him for burning it? 

A: Not really, because I had it a
ll in my mi nd. And I kept singing 
these songs, so I didn™t forget 
them. 

Q: Are there any other songs other th
an the one that you sang earlier -- 
A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: -- that you™d like to share with us? 

A: Sure. 

Q: They™re wonderful songs. 

A: Once I gave a recital, my only recital, in the partisan hospital. We went to the village called 

Tatanna, and the -- the doctor of 
the hospital -- I mean, we went 
there because my father needed 
some  me dicine, and the doctor asked me , ﬁ Do yo
u sing any songs?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes I do.ﬂ He says, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
46 
 
would you like to come , th -- this was a monast
ery and in a big room they had convalescent 
partisans, and I sang all the songs I -- I knew.  

Q: So why don™t you sing 
one or two more for us? 

A: One more. This one is talking about how t
onight we™re going to sleep outdoors on -- on the 
grass, and is -- is talking about 
love for the country -- for -- for 
Greece. And then the -- the line 
that is very significant is that 
s -- it says, let the -- the king of
 the underworld to come  and see 
with what kind of me n he is goi
ng to tangle with, and let hi m sele
ct whom he wants to take down 
to the earth. [sings in Greek
]. That™s [indecipherable] 
Q: Tell me , are these songs sort of 
--  were they written s-specifi cally
 by the partisans, are these -- 
A: Yes.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yes, by -- by mu -- musi -- partisan talented musicians. 

Q: So when -- when the war was ove
r and you were now in 1945 -- 1944 -- 
A: 15. 

Q: -- fi -- 15 years old. And you went back and finished school -- 

A: Yes, high school. 

Q: -- finished high school, and then did you then go on to college? 

A: Well, that was -- I -- I finished 
one year earlier in --
 in but -- at the age 
of 17. Then, after this 
episode with the permit, I went to -- to Athe
ns and I had to study some thing like 15 hours a day 

in a preparatory kind of course. Because there they don™t have 
pre-med or pre-dent, all these 
subjects, organic, inorganic chemistry, biology 
and anthropology and lite
rature, you -- you have 
to go and take the exams. The exams were ve
ry difficult, there were 820 candidates for 30 
positions, and I came 17
th
. And that™s how I entered the university. And my 1953, I graduated as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
47 
 
a dentist, and then I waited for a few months, I di
d not know any English at that time . And I went 
to a private teacher who studied, 
tell me c - a - t, cat, d - o - g, dog, and then I took with me a 
me thod without a teacher when I went into the ar
my. This book is -- is -- 
has a very interesting 
story, because when my father was drafted in the 
army, he thought that this was some  sort of a 
picnic because he was assigned in a de sk job, a
nd so he -- he was fat and he took with him all 
kinds of sweets, and all kinds of underwear and al
l that. And this big without a teacher English 
me thod. But  the Germans attacked on April sixth,
 and the orders changed, and every ma n was 
sent to the front on foot. So with the f-first st
op my father got rid of 
all the sweets, emptied 
everythi ng that -- because  he couldn™t walk that --
 the -- the way se -- some other soldiers were 

able to. So he put everything down, including the 
English book. To ma ke the long story short, on 

the way back he pass through the same  area, everyt
hing has been cleared, with the exception of 

the English book, which was full of mud and its pa
ges were broken di --
 people had stepped on 
it. He took it with him, eventual
ly he cleaned it, he repaired it,
 and that was the book that I took 
with me  in the army, and that™s how I started 
learning English, and now this has a -- a place of 
honor in my  library. 

Q: And you had intended to come  to the United States? 

A: Oh no, no. I -- if you are an officer in the Gree
k army in the me dical corps at that time , yo-
you -- you were supposed to serve fo
r three years. And th -- duri
ng that time  I was studying both 
French and English, and a-actually 
I wanted to go to France for si
x months after the three years, 
to -- to learn some thing and have some break, you
 know, after all these years. Well, my  parents 
persuaded me  that if I wanted to go for a post-gr
aduate course I should go to America. And that™s 
how I came here to Georgetown Dental School fo
r a post-graduate course. This -- but when I 
came to the United Stat es, within the fi rst fi ve 
days in New York, I liked it so much that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
48 
 
thought I wasn't  going to go back to Greece. So I 
realized that the un -- that the post-graduate 
course was of no use, the -- I had -- Greek or an
y European dental degr
ee were not recognized. 
Georgetown University did not accept me . They to
ld me  if you want to get a Master™s or Ph.D., 
we™ll give it to you, but 
we are not going to give you what you need to become  a -- a DDS. So I 
went to Howard University, and I went there as
 a sophomor e. I finished
 sophomore, junior and 
senior year and then I became an instructor at 
Howard, and then I opened 
a private practice. And 
later on I went also as an assist
ant professor for a -- one day a week
 for three years. And then -- 
Q: So you went as an undergraduate to Howard? 
A: Y-Yes, sophomore, yes. 

Q: And then your degree from Greece was accepted? 

A: No, no.  

Q: So how -- how --  

A: I got the -- I got the degree from Howard. I --
 I -- I passed the boards on the basis of the DDS 
fr om Howard University. But I worked there as full time instructor for two years. And then I 

opened my own private practi
ce, which -- and I be -- becam
e a retired dentist in 1995. 
Q: What -- what so attracted you when you cam
e  to New York?  Why did you like it so much? 
A: Why -- I liked the Fifth Avenue, Central Park. I 
went to a play, ﬁInherit the Wi nd,ﬂ with Paul 
Newman. I went to all the museums , and I fell in
 love with America. I didn™t know then what 
they did during the war. 

Q: Uh-huh. And when did you bring your parents over? 

A: My -- once I decided to stay 
here, that was in 1956, I -- my si
ster came in 1959 as a student at 
GW. And then when it was time th
at -- and I got married in 1960 -- 
when my sister was going to 
get ma rried in 1963, then my parents came for the we
dding and I also told them that we are both 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
49 
 
here, why don™t you come  to stay with us?  And they
 -- i-it wa s pretty nice 
for them because they 
would stay with us, they didn't have to work. It
 -- it was like  a continuous vacation, they would 
be here for ni ne months, then in the su mmer 
they would go to Greece. They would ma ke other 
trips all over Europe and Israel. 
And -- and here they would go to
 Florida and California, so it 
was very nice. 
Q: That™s nice. And you have two children? 

A: I have two daughters, and now we have
 one three year old grandson, and two -- 
Q: [indecipherable]  

A: -- pregnant daughters -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- who fortunately they™re married. 

Q: Right. I want to thank you very much
 for talking with me this morning.  
A: It has been a pleasure.  
Q: What we™d like to do now is take some  
of the photographs that you brought, and have you 
comment about them, okay? 

A: All right. 

Q: Okay, Mike, what is this photo? 

A: This is in Ioannina, around 1932 
to ™33. I was there either two, 
two and a half, some thing like 
that. 

Q: And this photo? 

A: This is in the city of Arta with my fa ther 
and mother, and I mi ght be 
ma ybe five or five and a 
half years old. 

Q: Could you tell -- sa -- tell 
us the name s of your parents? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
50 
 
A: My mother is Esther Matsas. Her parents 
were Gracia and Josef Kwe
n of Albania and my 
father is Leon Matsas, who was born in Ioannina. 
It™s interesting to know that my -- my mother™s 
parents, my grandparents, survived in Albani
a, in Vergnon. Their house was the headquarters of 
the German army in -- in Vergnon. And they lived 
with the Ge rmans for the duration of the war. 
Only on the last day that the Germans were l
eaving, they blew up and burned the house and the 
shops they ha d underneath, and they claim that 
this was done not because they were Jews, but 
because they did not have enough time  to destroy 
their archives. Otherwise, none of the Jews of 

Albania were -- was arrested.  

Q: And this picture? 

A: This is 1945. My mo ther, father, my sister Mine
tta, and the suit that I w
ear is a suit that was 
given to me by the Join
t Distribution Committee. 
Q: Okay. And this? 

A: This is myself in 1948 in Athens, with my
 cousin Sam Mayhere, who escaped from a Ger man 
concentration camp in Larisa. And he  was almos t
 executed by the partisans because they thought 

that he was a sort of a -- a anti-ELAS Ger man co
llaborator. And he was sa
ved at the last mo ment 
when a partisan approached him and he told him,  ﬁNow you say that you are a Jew, so we 

Christians when we go to bed at night, we ma
ke the sign of the cross, what do you Jews do? ﬂ 

And Sam said, ﬁWe say Shema Yisrael,ﬂ and he reci
ted it for him, and the partisan embraced him 
and he told him, ﬁDon™t be afraid, nobody will execute you.ﬂ 

Q: And this is you? 

A: Yes. I have to say some thing mo re about my 
cousin. After the war my cousin opened a -- a sh 
-- a shop where he was selling milk and cheese.
 A policeman owed him a lot of money. When 
my cousin pressed him to -- what are you goi
ng to do about what you owe me , the policeman 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
51 
 
wrote a report saying that he wa
s a communist. So when they drafted him in the army, they took 
him to an island, Makronsis, where they took all fo
rmer partisans to re-educate them. Part of the 
re-education was to beat them up. 
So they -- they -- when my c
ousin wen -- went there, the 
commander of the place realized they ma de a mi stake, that this ma n was not a communist, he 

was never a partisan. They di
dn™t understand. Maybe my cous
in explained to him what 
happened. So they told him, all right, you are not
 one of them. Take a 
bamboo stick and let™s go 

to beat them up. My cousin refused, so -- so th
ey moved him to the comm
unications service, and 
that™s how he was able to be 
on leave to -- to Athens. And that
™s when we  got this picture. 
Q: Okay, Mike what™s this? 

A: This is in the me dical complex in [ind
ecipherable] where we 
were studying physiology, 
pharmacology, anatomy, etcetera. And -- and this is 
in front of a beautiful statue of Hippocrates. 

And I am there with one of my classmates.  

Q: And -- and you™re on the right or the left? 
A: I am the handsome guy on the right. Th
e -- the right as I see it this way, right? 
Q: Yes. And here? 
A: This is also in Agrinion with 
my father, mother and Minetta.  
Q: And wha t  year was that? 

A: 1950.  

Q: And whe r e™s this? 

A: This is in 1951 when I decided to ma ke my firs
t visit to Psilovrahos, a
nd this is right in the 
outskirts of the village. 

Q: And this picture? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
52 
 
A: And this is in -- on -- i-it
™s a cave, a [indecipherable] cave where I went  there escorted by a 
villager who knew the area, and a lieutenant wh o was very much interested in knowing why I 
went there, and ma ybe he suspected I wa
s going to meet somebody in this cave.  
Q: And these were the caves where you we
re hiding at the end of the war, no? 
A: We  -- well, no, no, not th -- in the end of the wa
r. In -- in the -- duri
ng the first time that the 
Germans occupied the village, which they occupi ed
 only once, that was the time that we went to 
the house of -- of this ma n and his father. A
nd at that point we saw a line of villagers 
approaching and I thought that they were the 
Germans and I said, the Germans are here. And 
when I said that, we all ran in the forest. When the -- the father  of this man saw that we were so 

afraid of the Germans, he said, well if that™s 
the case, you -- you™d better not stay in my house, 
and I will take you to the -- to 
a cave where you can stay during th
e day and come  to sleep wi -- 
in our house at night. And that™s how
 we were introduced to the cave. 
Q: And wha t  was the name  of that family? 
A: [indecipherable]. And so this is the son of th
e -- of the ma n. And this is a beautiful cave with 
all kinds of stalactites, stalagmite
s. Actually, at that time  we we
re not so good in ecology and this 
was -- nobody knew about the cave, so I still ha ve  a few stalactites from -- from the cave.  
Q: And this picture? 

A: In this picture I™m treating in the dental offi
ce of the military hospital of Veria. I volunteered 
to treat some  orphans, and the director of the hos
pital allowed that, and these were my patients. 
Q: And this says 1954? 

A: Yes, that was -- was when I was in -- in Veria. 

Q: Who are these handsome men? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0403  
53
