GIORGIO PERLASCA 
August 5, 1990 
 
A: I was just a few months old when we
 left Koma , a nd we transferred to . 
 
Q: What did your father do a
nd what was life like in ? 

 

A: My father ha d a law degr ee just  as his fa
ther had a law degree. At the time  he was a 
Municipal Secretary, which in...uh...Italian admi
nistrative life was a very important 
position. 
 

Q: When he was growing up...uh...when he was growing up, when he became a young man 
in the 30s...uh.., tell us about...uh...his involveme
nt in the Spanish Civil War. How did 
that happen? 
 

A: I went as a volunteer. 

 

Q: How old we re you? 

 

A: Ithinktwenty-five. 

 

Q: And how long...how long were you there? 

 

A: Two and a half years. 

 
Q: When you come  back from the Spanish Civil Wa r, what did you do?  What was your 
work?  Do you go back to school?  What did you do? 
 
A: I started working in a trade firm. Thi s  fi
rm had its headquarters in Rome  and I worked 
however in ma ny Italian citi
es in Milan, Belluno, Genoa, and eventually traveled 
overseas. This firm dealt with...uh...with impor
ting food stuff, especially...uh...livestock 
and process meat.  
 

Q: What happened to you and to your business as war approached? 

 

A: Well, the war star ted almost immediately. I 
started working for this comp any at the end 
of 1939, and the war started in September 
39, so it started imme diately. However, it 
didn't start for Italy. Italy entered the war on June 10th, 1940. 
 

Q: And when the war broke out, just tell us...t
ake your time...tell us what happened to you 
and what you did in the early years of the war. 
 

A: Nothing happened. I continued to work. I di
dn't get involved in the war because I had an 
official function with  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
2 
 
 the Italian State because this company impor
ted livestock and process meat from Central 
Europe. 
 
Q: Did you come  into contact with any Jews
 at that time or did you know anything about 
what was happening to Jews in Europe?   
 

A: Uh...We ll, in Italy...uh...nothi
ng was happening at the time. I had some  Je wish friends 
that I had gone to school w
ith and I saw them unt il 1940. However, there were some  laws 

in Italy, and because of these laws, Italia
ns ...Italians of Jewish faith preferred to 
immi grate to overseas, such as Central America and North America.  
 

Q: When did it begin to change for you? Uh...
When did you begin to need to move out of 
Italy and the business? 
 

A: Things started changing imme diately in 
Decembe r of 1940. No. Actually, that was June  
in 1940. I started traveling overseas places su
ch as Croatia, Yugoslavia, Ruma nia, 
Turkey. 
 

Q: Just tell us then what happened in your words as it happened. 

 

A: If you're referring to the 
situation of the Italian Jews
, nothing was happening in Italy 
except for those raci al laws, which limited the professional in their trade activities, and 

therefore, they preferred to
 immi grate. However, everyone was free and you could go to 
restaurants and bars any time. Howe ver, we
 did have information and news that the 
situation is Germany as far as the persecu
tion of Jews was concerned was very bad 
starting in 1939, and with the invasion of 
Poland the persecution escalated and it also 
escalated in Czechoslovakia. These, of course, 
things that we all heard, but I saw it with 

my own eye s  in Poland and in Croatia, a
nd Bulgaria. Of course, in Bulgaria, King 
Boris...until King Boris was alive he tried to 
limit the persecution against Jews. And in 
Rumania, of course, the persecution 
became extremely cruel in 1940...uh...and it was 
worse in Ruma nia than in Germany where in Ruma nia, the Ruma nians can be very 

ferocious when they nurture political hate.  
 

Q: At what point then did you...uh...go to Hungary
?  When and how did th
is happen?  Tell us 
your story. 
 

Q: Excuse me . I think I want to pause and st
op a mi nute please. We are going to stop for a 
mi nute. Are we almost ready or are they 
still checking. Okay. 5 seconds to stand by. 
Okay. 
 

A: Getting back to the Jewish question, this was a very situation for them. When I was in 
Croatia, Bulgaria, Ruma nia, and Poland I knew 
it was very se rious then because of the 
German occ upation because extremist Nazi
 governme nt been...uh...placed because the 
Germans excentriated the fight against the Jews 
and so the situation was very critical. For 
example in Belgrade, where I lived for a year 
even though I...I traveled
 while living there, 
I saw that the beginning of 1942, the Jews comp
l e tely were disappear
ed, were wiped out. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178

Uh...I mmediately, however, the Jews were free to
 go to restaurants w
ith their Christians 
friends although there we re some  restrictions
 there too. And so when I was in Hungary, I 
was surprised to see that th
e Hungarian Jews were free...uh...
basically free. Uh...We  had 
business dealings with them 
and we could go to bars rest
aurants with them, and of 
course, this is not true in 
other countries that 
I had me ntioned...uh...whe
re the persecution 
against Jews was very ugly. 
 
Q: What was it like for you in Hungary of 1942? 

 

A: Fine. We could eat. We coul
d drink. We could take walks. 
We had a lot of fun. We could 
go to the movies a little bit. We danced a lo
t. Uh...We could bars, worked, and everything 
worked for everyone. There were no restrictions. 
 

Q: When did things begin to change? 

 

 

A: Things suddenly changed on the eveni
ng between the 18th and the 19th of March 1944. 
 

Q: Tellus. 

 

A: Uh...That day Admi ral Hortee who was a 
region of the Prime Region of Hungary...in 
other words he was head of State, traveled to
 Germany to me et with Hitler. However, he 
was arrested and detained for a few days. 
During those days, the Hungarian De mocratic 
governme nt was struck down. At the time even though Hungary was in war, the 

governme nt was a demo cratic governme nt. It ha
d a parliame nt, a sena
te, a constitution. 
Uh...So during Admi ral Hortee's imprisonment...uh...t
hey took advantage of this fact to 
install a Nazi government. He...the Admi ral 
then returned but the governme nt had...was 
already in place. And the first measures that 
were taken were anti-Je wish laws that were 
passed and the first...including the imposing... 
imposition of wearing the star, the Davi d 
Star, on the front and on the back.  
 

Q: What was life like for you?  
Did life change for you as well? 
 

A: Uh...Yes, life did change for me  because 
after the Italian Armi stice on Sept ember 8th, 
1943, I rema ined loyal to the Queen's gove
rnme nt and so therefore I was among 
those...uh...who were to be arrested, who were
 supposed to be arrested by the Germans. 
Uh...But that morning I left my
 home  and I never returned.  
 

Q: Excuse me . We 'r e going to have to stop. Excu
se me . You tell him that
 an entire contract 
hinges on that ma n's stopping. Now! 
 

A: Readynow? 

 

Q: Al most. Just keep on going. Okay. 

 

A: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178

A: Uh...After the Armi stice on September 8th, 
1943, I had rema ined loyal to the Italian 
governme nt, and so I did not adhere to Mussolin
i's Social Republic. So therefore because 
of this and because I had had some trad
e disagr eeme nts with Germans in Hungary, 

I...uh...decided to hide when the Germans 
invaded Hungary...uh...on that morning, early 
morning of March 19th. 
 

Q: What did you do? 

 

 

A: Uh...Yes. Yes. I needed to
 find a situation...a solution 
to..uh...my situation and I found 
one when I asked the Spanish Legation forasylum. Uh...Bec ause I had fought in the 

Spanish Civil Wa r, I could take advantage of
 the fact that the Spanish government had 
said that anyone who had fought...any foreigne
r who fought in this war who should ever 
find hims elf in difficulties could turn to th
e Spanish Diplomatic authorities for help. 
And...uh...I ask therefore the Spanish governme nt 
to give me a passport if...if I thought 
that I needed and temporary citizenship. I di
dn't actually get it right
 away. I didn't go and 
pick up my passport right away. Uh...in...in 
March 1944, and I hid for one week in the 
Spanish extraterritorial buildings. Then the 
Hungarian government notified me  that I was 
to be interned and so I presented myself a
nd I was interned fro m th
e beginning of April to 

October 13th, 1944. During that time I could no
t follow the situation closely because I 
wasn't  in Budapest. We  did hear...uh...about
 unpleasant...we did hear about unpleasant 
news. Uh...We...we could read pape
rs, but there was censorship.  
 

Q: What happened next? 

 
A: Uh...The internme nt wasn't  bad at all. 
We  had three meals a day. We  had tea...uh...with 
small cakes and cigarettes and soap and toot
hpaste, even some  pocket money. And all of 
this was according to the Geneva Conventi
on. Uh...And there was treatment afforded to 
Italian di plomatic me mb ers, and I fell within that categor y.  
 
Q: Why was he  then considered an 
Italian diplomat?  
At that point? 
 

A: And because I was with the Italian Tr ade Commi ssion. 

 

Q: When did the internme nt stop?  What happened to you? 

 

A: It didn't stop. I escaped. 

 

Q: Please tell us about it. 

 

A: You want to know how he escaped? 

 

Q: Yes.

A: Uh...On Oct ober 13th, 1943, I was very lucky. 
I had these fake papers which authorized 
me  to go to Budapest for health reasons. They 
weren't...it wasn't  really true but anyway I 
had the papers. Luckily, that morning a Swiss diplomatic car arrived with a Swiss 
diplomatic and an Hungarian diplomatic who 
came to visit the internees where we were 
and check on me . And that day I asked themto take me  to Budapest. Of course, they 

inquired about my documents and they reali
zed they were fake, but they took me  to 
Budapest anyway and that was on the 13th. 
On the 15th, Admi ral Hortee proclaimed 
Ar mi stice and....uh...but...uh...he specified in Au
gust of 44...it specified in August 44, 
Admi ral Hortee had fired. I must specific...I
'm sorry, in August 1944, Admi ral Hortee 
had fired the Nazi governme nt, had eliminat
ed the Nazi government and set up in its 

place a military governme nt which is headed by General Lackatosh. Uh...This 

governme nt first abolished the Star of David, 
the wearing the Star of David, and struck 
down the racial laws. So for 
about a month the Jewish comm
unity lived in relative peace. 
For example on October 14th, I lunched with a 
Jewish Hungarian in 
a big restaurant in 
Budapest. On the next day on the 15th, I lunched with Mrs. De  Franco, who is also 

Jewish Hungarian ma rried to a Italian diplomatic in a public restaurant. And during this 

lunch we heard that Admi ral Hortee had proc
laimed ar mi stice to the Soviet Union and 
Anglo-Americans.  
 

Q: Question: He  had said he left internme nt in 1943. Did he mean 1944? 

 

A: 44. 

 

Q: Thank you. Okay. After you...what happened to 
you after this lunche
on in October of 44 
with Senora DeFranco. Where di
d you go and what did you do? 
 
A: Uh...This lady was very fearful when she h
eard this news which was being repeated on 
the radio, broadcast over and over again. Anyhow, I...I didn't know what to do and so I 
decided to seek refuge in my Hunga rian friend's house for a few days. But after a few 

days they asked me  to leave because they said it was dangerous for them...uh...because 

the Germans and the Hungarians...the NaziHungarians had bombarded the Royal Palace, 

and Admi ral Hortee was taken prisoner a
nd...and taken to Germany. And immediately 
following these events, the real anti-Jewish te
rror began. At least that's what I saw. And 
the wearing of the star wa s imposed once ag
ain. But anyhow, I left my friend's house and 
went to a private hospital but even there afte
r a few days the Director  aske d me  to leave 
for...uh...same reasons. The next mo rning, ther
efore, I decided to ask...to go to the 
Spanish Legation to ask for the passport that 
the Spanish government had promised me in 
September 43 but which I didn't pick up because 
I didn't want to change nationality at the 
time. Uh...So...uh...we went...I went to the Lega
tion and they had to write up a letter 
saying they had searched for me  a fe w years 
and that they finally found me and so that 
we could proceed with the change of citizenshi
p. So together with a...an attorney from the 
Spanish Legation, we went to the Hungarian 
Ministry of Interior where my Italian 
citizenship was abolished and I became  a Sp
anish citizen. And I was aske d to leave the 
country within 15 days. Naturally, I coul
dn't leave. Where...where could I go? 
 

Q: Please.Continue.

BREAK IN TAPE  

 

A: Un...When I  returned from the Ministry 
to the Legation, there wa
s a lot of confusion. 
There were a lot of people outside the Lega
tion. Some  of them we
re wearing the star. 
Some  were not. There we re about a hundred 
people. I asked the attorney what was 
happening and he responded that the Jews we
re seeking protection, but the Legation had 
a problem because the only one Christianwho could handle all the workload because 

the–the attorney told me he was also Jewis
h, and that he was a war hero. He had been a 
war hero during World War I. And so anyway they had this problem because they 

had...didn't have enough people and they even 
had at one point 300 people who had been 
protected and who were taken away and 
they did not know anything about their 
whereabouts. So at that point I went to the a
nd I told that what I ha
d just learned myself 
and offered my help. He replied that...uh...he
 would be willing and happy to work...to 
have me  work with him, but he couldn't pay 
me. And I said that I didn't need any money, 
that I had enough to live on in 
those days. So we had one mor e  letter written up to the 
Ministry...to the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry of Hungary which we took over 
with...uh...Sanspritz which...uh... was an official 
statement that I was a member of the  
Spanish Legation and we had it...a stamp put on 
it, and I also got my diplomatic identify 
card...uh... Si nce Sanspritz therefore was deali
ng exclusively with the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry. That was his responsib
ility. Myk responsibility wa
s to deal with the Jewish 
protection organization. I had 
the authorization, official 
authorization to do that. 
However, I didn't know how to
 start. Uh...And so I asked 
around and I asked Attorney 
Farkosh who unfortunately died the first da
y that the Russians arrived and that this 
tragedy and a new tragedy started.  
 
Q: We are going to pause and change tapes. 
 

End of Tape #1

TAPE #2 
 
A: At the beginning...uh...my work consiste
d in trying to find the 300 people who 
were...who had been protected by the Spaniard
s and who were arrested...who had been 
arrested by the Nazis...uh...at the very...the very
 fi rst few days of the new governme nt. So 
a couple of time s I went, I traveled to the 
Hungarian German border and eventually we 
found a few of these people who had better 
protection from the Spanish Legation. And 
we took them back to Budapest. Uh...Then we
 went to this train station where goods and 
me rchandise are unloaded on the docks...on th
e platforms. I'm sorry. And...uh...these are 
the platforms where the Germans took away 
thousands of Jews to Germa ny. And there 
we found there more people. And out of the 300, we found a bout 150. We don't know 

what happened to rest. At the time...uh...that re
mi nds me , I ha d a small...a little episode 
happened to me . I saw that there was a co
lumn of people who were being deported 
and...uh...among these people, there were two tw
ins who were very 
attractive kids and 
very friendly looking kids who were about
 11 years old. And...uh...so I thought to my self, 
what would happen to them and...uh...decided to
 tell them, "Look, kids. You see that car 
over there with the Spanish flag. Run to the 
car and the chauffeur will close the doors and 
you'll be safe." But at that mo ment a  major 
of the Gestapo ran to the car because he 
wanted those kids back. I told them that the ki
ds were in an extrater
ritorial car protected 
by the Spanish Legation. So he took out a gun an
d threatened me . But next to me  was Mr. 
Wallenberg, who told the German that I was a 
representative of the Spanish Government 
and that the kids were in an extrate
rritorial car. And...uh...so the German responded, 
"Leave me  alone. You're...you're i mpeding...you'
re disturbing my work." And so I 
responded, "You call this work?" So, of cour
se, he got ma dder and ma dder and everyone 
was speaking very loudly at the same time 
and that includes Wallenberg; that includes a 
Vatican representative; the Swiss and the Port
uguese representative
s; all the neutrals. 
And at that point a Colonel approached a
nd asked what was happening and he was told 
and he fi nally said, "Well, let it be. Their tim
e will come too", meaning that the two kids 
would be taken away. So the kids...uh...stayed 
in the car and the two Germans left. And I 
asked Wa llenberg who that ma n was , and he responded, "That was Eichmann." 

The...uh...two kids didn't have a letter, obvi
ously, of protection....uh...so when we got 

back to the Legation...oh..and...and when we got to
 the Legation, I realized they were not 
two boys as I had thought, but it was a boy and 
a girl who looked identical but they were 
of a different sex and so I had to find a 
house for them but I don't re me mb er the details. 
At the time  if I reme mbe r , we only had one house. 
 

Q: Keep going please. Pl ease continue . 

 

A: So the...uh...the org...the organization to
 protect...the Spanish organization to 
protect...uh...Jews started and this
 was an initiative...was not an
 initiative of the Legation. 
Uh...The Spanish governme nt was 
trying...was not an initiative 
of the Legation. It was the 
Spanish Governme nt was trying to save as ma
ny Jews as possible and 
I saw that this was 
happening in Croatia. Uh...and according to Spanish...uh...norms and regulations, they 

were trying to save as ma ny Jews as possi
ble. Uh...We had one house at the beginning 

and we slowly built up to six houses. But the protection consisted of muc h more than just 

writing the letters and of putting up a fl
ag and a banner. That was not enough. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178

The...uh...much more attention had to be given to
 the aftermath and...and to the fact that 
the Nazis could take them 
away. And so we had to pr
ovide protect...that kind of 
protection too, not only to our Legation but
 to the others too, to Switzerland, 
Sweden...uh...to the Vatican and to the Portugue
se. At the end of Nove mber, we had 
about 3,000 people who were being protecte
d. Now on the...other...the last day of 
Nove mber or the first of December, Sansprit
z left  Hungary. Now, in a document that I 
have written previously...me morial that I ha
ve written previously, I wrote down the date 
as being December 7. I did that to cover Sanspr
itz. I di d that because I wanted to pr otect 
him and he needed 10 days, about 10 days mo
re  than necessary so that I could protect 
him. But now I have chosen to tell the trut
h. However, I can't  give you any more details 
now, because I first ha ve to speak with the Spanish Ambassador. I will speak with him 
tomorrow e vening because some thing happe
ned which disturbed me  very much. 
Some thing very sad happened. And it was sad be
cause it revealed to me  that this huma n 

soul has...uh...evil elements in it. But first be
fore getting into this, I must speak to the 
Spanish Ambassador for reasons of loyalty. 
Anyway, that day...uh...either the last day of 
Nove mber or the first day of Dece mber 
and I don't re me mbe r  exactly which one, 
Sanspritz, who is a diplomat, a career diplomat 
left. And so I was trying to decide what to 
do. I'd heard by the way that he'd left at
 about 6:00 AM...uh...through a phone call and I 

don't re me mber if it was him...if he personall
y who called me  or some one  else, a legal 

attaché or what. But anyway, I learned that he
 was...that he'd left. And so I took a walk 
around the international ghetto 
wondering what I could do an
d I found myself in Lagradi 
Corroli Street, and I saw that this building wa
s being occupied by the police, so I entered 
the building and asked what was happeni
ng and saw that there were people with 
suitcases, a fe w suitcases and...uh...the people, 
the Jews in the house told me  that the 
police want...wanted to take them away. So 
I decided to lock the door and...uh...I...I went 
to see the lieutenant and I as
ked him what was happening and I told him that he couldn't  
do this because the house is being protect
ed...uh...by the Spaniards and he needed my  
permission, and I was surprised at his behavior
 since he was part 
of the regular police 
forces. He was not a parliame ntary police force.
 So we came  to an agreement. The police 
agreed to postpone everything for a few days 
and we went to a park where we me t with 
these me mb ers who belonged to a committee 
which have representatives from police 
force, Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affair
s, and I protested what was happening and 

some one told me  that the...that they had hear
d that the Spanish repr
esentative had fled the 
city and so there was no more 
relations with the Spanish Gove
rnment. I told him that he 

was wrong and that the Spanish had not fled but 
that he'd went to Germany to talk with 
his colleagues from Germany, France and Sw
itzerland and at the meantime I was his 
legal substitute and I had documents 
to prove it. Uh...I dema nded that the 
Hungarians...uh...uh...respect th
e agreement that...that existed between Spain and 
Hungary. So the foreign affairs representativ
e agreed to postpone everything by 2 or 3 
days which gave..uh...new time to go to the Fo
reign Affairs Ministry to solve the 
situation.  
 

Q: Pleasecont inue. 

 

A: During this conversation in the park, I saw 
a column of Jews who'
d been deported from 
the international ghetto which was right th
ere and...uh...I saw that these were people who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
9 
 
were once in the houses protected by the Span
iards and I think this was in the...Palina 
Street, but I'm not sure. Uh...So I ma de them
 give me these people back. There were 
about 300 of them. By the way in the hotel wh
ere I'm staying, Mr. Voni came  to see me 
and he was staying in a hous
e in the...the Gradi No. 25. He was 12 at the time  and his 
me mory is better than mi ne and he remi nded 
me of some details of
 that incident. For 
example, he told me that there was a little
 11 year old girl who came to see me  when I 
went to that house and asked me , "Please Mr. Sa
ve my mother." So I said, "Yes. Yes. Be 
good and stay put." And she came back to me  three times with the same  request and the 
last time she came to me and she said, "Look, if
 you save my mother I'll go to bed with 
you." So I slapped her. And...uh...then her mother came to me  and asked me  why I'd 

slapped her and, of course, I explained to he
r and perhaps I didn't do the right thing to 
slap her but anyway that...that's what
 happened. Uh...Then there was another lady 
who...whose name  I don't reme mber right now an
d who was in park who is living in the 
same street and same house as Eva Lang, th
at Eva Lang was living on the 4th floor, and 
this other lady...lady was living on the 5th 
floor with her husband. But, of course, I 
couldn't know everyone at the time. I 
didn't even know Eva Lang....uh...who now is 
fa mous. She  is a famous artist and journalist
. But anyway, I went back to the Legation 
and I found there a representa
tive of...representative of the Swedish Legation, Mr. 
Danielson and he...uh...had told me  that Mr. Sans
pritz had given him the responsibility to 
protect the Spanish...uh..Legation. I was very 
mu ch afraid and became very fearful 

because the relations...diplomatic relations
 be tween Sweden and...uh...Hungary were not 
good. So...he also told me  that...uh...he was
...uh...he took 17,000 Swiss Francs from the 
Spanish Legation, and that he would 
send his assistant to check on the 
situation...uh...regularly. And I became  quite f
earful, so I called the Swedish Legation, 

and I said, "Please don't send anyone. We  don't
 need your protection because that will 
ma ke ma tters worse." And he was happy to 
hear this because...uh..., of course, Swedish 
relations with Hungary were not good. And as
 ma tter of fac t  some  serious events had 
occurred. The...uh...the Swedish...I'm sorry...the
 Spanish...uh...diplomatic legation had an 
influence on Hungary and we didn't understand it
 at the time  why we had this favorable 
treatment. We under...only understood it late
r. Uh...But anyhow, the...uh...there was no 
more question of being protected by the Swedes.  
 

Q: Alright.Continue. 

 

Q: Okay. Can you give me  the jest of it and 
then we'll go on and do the translation later? 
 

A: Okay. Okay. Uh...The same  day I st
arted in my r e gular activities which 
included...included the continuous granting of letters of
 protection, which included 
finding houses because  si x were now even
tually built up to eight. And...uh...this work 

intensified and I established relations with 
the various police forces
, with the Hungarian 
Nazi Party, and I was looking for support, a
nd it didn't matter where it came from. The 
important thing was that I got support
...uh...because letters were not enough. These 
houses needed to be...needed to be pr otecte
d 24 hours a day. Uh...If you talk to , she will 
tell you ma ny more details. She was a young gi
rl at the time and sh
e lived through this 
tragedy with her family. But anyway, I was s
eeking contacts. It di
dn't matter where they 
came from. The important thing was that...that th
ey were useful contacts. So I went to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
10 
 
Foreign Affairs Ministry to clarify the s
ituation. I said...clari
fy...uh...and I said...I told 
them what I...what I had to say. Whe n I...whe
n I use the clarify...when I knew this I said 
what I had to say. And...uh...the permanent, the foreign affairs permanent secretary 
just...uh...believed what I said and...uh...and I 
began to...I began to understand why 

Hungary had so much r e spect for the Span
ish Le gation. I only began to understand. It 
wasn't  perfectly clear. And this was because...uh...in Madrid, the 

Hungarian...uh...Legation in Madrid
 had rema ined faithful, loyal to Hortee after October 
15th. And, of course, all Hunga
rians still looked to Hortee. And the Nazi governme nt 
didn't have a representative in the Span
ish governme nt and they wanted one, and I 
understood that they wanted one. Uh...Anyway, we came to an agreement and...uh...I 

get...I got the sensation that I was be
ing...uh...that I was in a stronger position...uh...and I 
even saw the Foreign Affairs Minister fo
r a few mi nutes...uh...Mr. Kennenee. And having 
understood this, we worked better. And 
it was lucky because...uh...I don't  know if 
Sanspitz either forgot or le
ft on purpose a...his signature pad. Uh...And which I used. The 
agreement were that no letters could be date
d after Novemb er 8th, so I just dated all the 
letters before Nove mber 8th, and I used hi
s signature although I signed about 50 mys e lf 

after December and I also signed two or thre
e passports which...which, of course, were 
false and had no legal bearing. Uh...Anyw
ay, the weeks passed by and...uh...I understood 
that they wanted to send a representative 
to Madrid to...uh...forge peace treaty, to sign a 
treaty...uh...and they realized their mist
ake and...uh...uh...elimi nating Hortee, so...uh...the 
other legations were...didn't  count. The Swedish Legation had been destroyed. The 

embassy didn't count and...uh...had Swedish pr
otection, but it didn't count and the 

Portuguese counted very little. There wa
s a Vatican, but...uh...Fununchio was tired. He  
was old and he was sick and a
lthough he was in good faith, the Sw
iss were like fish in the 
water. You never knew what they were goi
ng to do. And...anyway, no one counted really, 
because they were all against Nazis. Uh...The
re was the International Red Cross that was 
headed by Mr. We ir ma n, who...uh...who I will talk about later...uh...diplomatic 

representatives need courage in
 tragic mo me nt. I don't know if
 I had courage and I really 
wasn't  think about it at the time. I wasn't  
thinking about the dangers. But I will say this. 
That the repr esentative of the Intern
ational Red Cross who had ambassadorial 
rank...uh...was a..uh...wicked ma n. Uh...I've...even if I've written differently at ot her 

times, now I can say that he is a wicked ma n. 
 

Q: Ask him ple a se why the representative 
from the Red Cross was a wicked man. Please 
explain. 
 

A: I say that because he didn't  have any c
ourage. Uh...Perhaps I didn't have any courage 
either, but he locked hims elf in the base
me nt of a hotel...uh...and didn't come  out. I...to 
proceed with this st ory, I me t with a...a German General who was the military 

representative in the city 
to protest...uh...the fact that
...uh...Jews were being taken from 
the international ghetto to the common ghett
o. So I went to...uh...see him. I would go to 
anyone who I thought could help me . And...uh...I
 said that I wa s disturbed by these 
move ments because the enemy mi ght think that 
actually they were troops that were being 
moved so...uh...I was fearful of that so I asked him if the Red Cross, International Red 

Cross, the Swedes...the Swiss had any...uh...contact
s with the Soviet Union for...or could 
have any contacts with the Soviet Union fo
r an honorable surrender of the capitol. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
11 
 
the German replied that he had his orders, a
nd he couldn't do anything 
about it. So I went 
to see Weirman, and I told him wha t  the German
 General had said and 
that if he sought 
contacts with the Soviet Uni
on, then an honorable surrender mi
ght be possible in order to 
avoid further fighting and deaths. And he told
 me  that he just would not do it, and he 
could not do it. Uh...And I knew that he was 
living in this baseme nt all the time...and 
reinforced basement, was reinforced so that he
 could be protected from bombs. And that's  
why I say that he was wicked. He didn't  
do anything. Uh...By the way, that remi nds me 
that I have...I bought condensed milk for the ki
ds on the black ma rket with the Red Cross 
symbol.  
 

Q: Okay. Let's pause. We  need to pause a
nd change tapes. Let's do this very fast.

A: I just want to clarify what I meant about 
We ir man. Uh...I said that he was wicked and but 
not everyone was like me  who could...uh...they ha phazardl y and casually just get 

involved in...in the situations 
like I did. What I'm trying to 
say is that I think he was 
wicked because I would have done differentl
y. Probably in his situation and his physical 
me ntal state of mi nd he had his reasons for 
doing that, but I would have done differently. 
 

Q: Why...why do you think you did what you did? 

 

Q: Thank you. Are we done?  Did you finish.

Tape #4 
 
Q:  Would you tell me your name please? 
 

A:  My name  is George Perlasca. 

 

Q:  And you were born where? 
 
A:  I was born in Komo (ph) on January 31st, 1910. 

 

Q: – 

 

A:  You're welcome. 

 

Q: – 

 

A:  It's  too muc h for my personality. 

 

Q: Can you tell us what happened to you when you were released from released from 
internme nt and you came  back to Budapest in 1944? 
 

A:  I escaped on October 13th, 1944. It wasn't
 an internment camp. I had my own room. 
Each person had his own room. We ate thr
ee time s a day and then we had tea in the 
afternoon and they even gave us cigarettes
, soap and toothpaste and even money. And 
this was according to the Geneva Conventi
on because I was aggregated to the Italian 
commercial delegation and therefore I had 
uh I wa s uh I could uh have diplomatic uh 
treatment. Uh the 13th I left. The 13th of Oct
ober and I arrived in B
udapest that evening 
and the next day I don't know what I did but
 on the 15th the armi stice was proclaimed 
between Hungary, Russia, Great Britain and Ame r ica. This was an announcement, a 

terrible announcement because no one was prepared for it except a few people who who 

knew questions of state and governme nt. I wa
s surprised. I was having lunch with an 
Italian lady who was of the Jewi
sh faith and she was married 
to an Italian diplomat and 
we...she was speechless and I was surprised, 
and I didn't know what to do. So I I hid 
because the TV was controlled by the Ad
mi ral _____ governme nt and everythi ng else 
fell in the hands of the Nazis and of the Ge
rmans, Hungarian Nazis and the German army 
and their...and then I went to hide in a 
house which belonged to a friend of mi ne, uh 

fa mily friends in the ______ and from this house I went to a hospital to hi de because I 

didn't know where to go because from the first evening I slept in a friend's house in 

______ who gave me  the keys to his apartment.
 The next day I discovered that the ma id 
was a German, a ____, and she was pro-Nazi and 
therefore I didn't go back to that house 
because it seemed dangerous to me. After a c
ouple of days in the hospital, I spent two 
more days in hiding. I wa s hidden by the la
nd...by the landlady in th
e house where I used 
to live once upon a time, but then 
I realized that the Ugandian (ph) Hotel that I knew very 
well was being emptied because ma ny German officers were leaving with their suitcases 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
14 
 
and I went to the keeper of the building and 
I asked him if he coul
d give me  a room and 
he said give me  a passport and I said I don'
t have any passport anymore. I don't have any 
more documents and he said OK, for two days
 I'll give you a room and then I...so I didn't 
know what to do. And so therefore the next morning I decided to go to the Spanish 

Legation. It was probably eight 
in the morning. I went ther
e and on the way, on the road, 
and I was on foot, on ____ Street which is a bi
g street, I saw that some  Hungarian Nazis 

were chasing a child who was probably seven 
or eight years old. They reached him and 
one of them shot the child in the back of th
e head. I was quite struck by this naturally and 
I asked a passerby why, what did that child 
do?  Who is he?  And he
 said he's  Jewish. 
From the roofs of the houses, however, there were some  Jews  who were shooting against 

the Nazis from the rooftop houses. But anyw
ay I went to the Legation and I found ___ 
who gave me a passport and I...he said come
 tomorrow with two photos, and I had two in 
my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them 
to him and then he gave me  the passport. 
And he also gave me  a letter from the  Minist
er of Interior which 
said that the Spanish 
governme nt two years earlier had gr anted me  th
eir citizenship because I had fought in the 
civil war and also, the 
letter also said...and that
 I had asked for a citizenship and the letter 
said that they were not able to locate me  a
nd that they now found me
 and I had to assume  
citizenship, Spanish citizenship. 
 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE 

 
So we were...with this letter 
I went together with the le
gal attaché–we went to the 
Minister of Interior where I 
changed citizenship. I canceled 
the Italian one and I assume d 
Spanish citizenship. Wh en I returned to the 
Legation that early morning, it was probably 
eight or nine a.m., and it's strange that that
 morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m. , 
but these were very difficult times and peopl
e didn't  always go to sleep. I saw...thank 
you...that there was a lot of confusion around, 
surrounding the Legation 
at the entrance 
and in the courtyard, and that 
ma ny of these people who were
 there had were wearing the 
David Star, Star of David, and I asked the le
gal attaché what was happening and he said 
that these we re people who are asking fo
r our protection, protection from the Spanish 
governme nt but right now we 'r e in difficulty
 because the only Christian legation is 
Sanspritz. And therefore it's impossible to 
organize an external protection and it's it 
doesn't  make any sense to give them protection 
letters but I said if I 
can be of help, then 
I...maybe I can do some thing, so we went to 
Sanspritz and I told hi
m I'm available if you 
need me , and he said yes. Sanspritz said 
yes but I can't  pay you because we don't have 
any funds to pay you with and I said I'm not 
interested because I have enough money to 
survive on my own. And so I started imme di
ately. I started working immediately. The 

first few hours I must tell the truth....I didn't 
know what to do and I didn't know where to 
start, but then after speaking with uh the atto
rney Fakash (ph) who 
was the attorney and 
also with the Chancellor and with other 
people who were there who were all Jews, 
Fakash, the Chancellor, her son 
and all of the refugees and so
 I realized what could be 
done. The first thing was to try to get b
ack about three hundred people who had been 
protected by Spain. They had about thr
ee hundred, only three hundred at that time  
because the Hungarian government had said
 three hundred, and Sanspritz accepted this 

decision on behalf of the Spanish governme nt 
and this is something that I didn't, didn't 
accept imme diately at first so those first two or
 three days my job was to try to find those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
15 
 
who had been protected, of the three hundred 
protected. Of the thre
e hundred I was able 
to get a hundred and fifty back and I found th
em at the uh Merchandise
 Depot, at the train 
station and also by going to the border be
tween Hungary and say Austria and Germany, 
and those who had a Spanish ID we were able 
to bring them back. It
 seems to me  we had 
rented two trucks but I don't re me mb er now 
how ma ny, or we  brought them back with the 
train or we reserved a special
 car...I, I don't really reme mber how that happened. I was 
with the car. I had a car. 
So I started working. I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if 
you're going to edit it, edit this tape..._____..s
o the episode at the train station...you can 
take it from the other tape and put it t
ogether, piece it togeth
er. (Pause- Technical 
Conversation)  The first episode that struck 
me very much and which opened my eyes to 
what was happening and to how things were actu
ally really were, at  the train station they 
were loading train cars with Jews who we
re being deported because the Hungarian 
governme nt said that it had _____ an agreement publicly with the German governme nt to 
give thirty million uh Jews who would go to
 work and then we understood that that 
wasn't  true, that they were going to work. They were people who were being deported 

and then we didn't know what would happen to them in the end, so much s o that Eva 

Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a labo
rer. He went on the train but on the trip 
between Budapest and the border he unde
rstood...I don't know how...but he understood 
that it was a trick and so he jumped fr om th
e train and he came back to Budapest. And he 
came back to Budapest to _______. I don't think that that building existed yet but anyway 

he came to one of the Spanish houses, so...thi
s episode of the two twins...at a certain 
point there was a column which was going a
nd we were looking to see if anybody was 
there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins,
 two kids of eleven 
or twelve years old. 
They were very handsome kids, nice kids and 
they were identical  and the more I saw the 
more I told myself how is it po
ssible that I, I let them go, an
d so I told these kids, you see 
that car over there.  Get in the car. Run to
 the car. Get into the car. Close the door and 
then the chauffeur will know what he has to
 do. Maybe you would like to hear from me  
how I could communicate with these people.
 At the time I spoke German, French, 
Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could e
xpress myself in Hungari
an for a little bit 
and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these 
children, but anyhow these kids went. One 
Gestapo ma jor came to and he wanted the kids
 back, and I said no. They were in the car. 
It's a Spanish car and it had a Spanish uh flag
 and a license pl ate, di plomatic license 
plates and therefore the car was extra-territ
orial property. He insist
ed. He took out his gun 
and then so forth, and next, Wa llenberg was 
next to me  and Walle
nberg said...told the 
major, the German major, look...this man re
presents Spain.  You can't ...you can't commit 
any violent acts. He said look. 
 He's getting in the way of 
my  work, and instinctively I 
replied that you call this work. That's what I 
asked him. And so he got even more angry. 
He wanted the kids back. And I...at that poi
nt I saw the situation getting really bad. I 
thought my God, this man is crazy. He could 
shoot us. He had a big gun, a Mauthauser 
(ph), a big big gun, but at that
 point...we were all yelli
ng. I was screaming. Wa llenberg, 
the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss,
 the Vatican...everyone 
intervened in the 
discussion. There were ma ny loud voices at the 
same  ti me  and so this colonel, a colonel 
came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...s
orry...came to see what was happening and 
he asked the ma jor what was happening and the 
ma jor explained it to him, and so he said 
now let it be...their time will come  too for the kids.  And so they left. And then I brought 

these kids home. I brought them to the Legation 
and I was surprised to see that they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
16 
 
really a boy and a girl who when they were
 fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it 
was a boy and a girl and they were perfec
tly identical. The same  height, the same  
face...everything, everything was identical. This
 is an episode that struck me  which, 
which along with the ot her episode of the child who was killed on the street, these two 
episodes made me reflect very much. It's not 
that ...at the time I really wasn't  fully aware 
of the situation. From the end of March to 
October 13th, I was not...I had been interned 

away from Budapest in the countryside...I 
continued my work. I stopped looking for the 
three hundred people because I got one hundred
 and fifty back and it seemed have 
understood that there was nothing more that coul
d be done and so I started to organize the 
protection network. We  had a house. I don'
t reme mber where it was. (Technical 
conversation) I don't remember which one it 
was but we did have one house. Maybe two 
houses we had already. Maybe they were ____ 
wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but 
anyway that's not important. I started 
organizing by issuing hundreds of letters 
imme diately. Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come  in. We  

would go to the office and type up these lette
rs. Sa nspritz didn't  know anything because 
we used his signature pad. He didn't know how
 ma ny. His job was to keep relations with 
the Foreign Affairs Minister. So we issued 
I think more than two thousand five hundred 
protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end 
of October and Nove mber. To 
be more specific...I couldn't be more specifi
c than that. I think we
 maybe reachedthree 
thousand, more or less. It wasn't  very easy. No
t only...it wasn't  sufficient to issue a letter 
of protection and to escort these people to th
eir house because  they had to be escorted to 
a building after all. I had some people who 
were willing to accompany these people with 
their cars uh as the letters of
 protection were issued. There 
we re cars who were available 
and who shuttled back and forth between th
e Legation and the houses where they were 
going to live and they would go back and fort
h continuously and therefore and so we had 
to uh provide for everything. We  had to get them
 settled.  Normally these apartments that 
we would take, we had to pay the rent, but th
ese are details that ar
e of no importance and 
perhaps we didn't even pay the rent. We  also 
had to feed these people and we had to be 
careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they di d do that. They did 

especially they would try to attack those 
Swedish houses and Swiss houses because they 
had a a system of protection which was not corr
ect. In other words, they had given, both 

of those countries had a mi xed committee, 
Jewish and Christian committee which was 
responsible for issuing letters
 of protection. To sum it up th
ese letters were being sold. 
The authorities and particularly
 the Nazis found out about this
 and so therefore every day 
they, they would come  and take uh raid the 
Swiss and the Swedish hous
es. I think that as 
far as I know Sweden issued forty million le
tters of protection a
nd in its houses it had 
ma ybe three or four thousand people because 
they would come  in the afternoon and the 
next day there would be raids,
 and this is not something th
at I just heard. They weren't 
rumors. I saw them with my very own eyes
 and with Wa llenberg I asked him why did 
you, why do you do that kind of stuff. That's  not
 correct. These letters
 are being sold and 
everyone knows about it. The authorities know 
about it. Anyway, we had to protect to 
prevent that these people be taken. We had to
 protect them. With one
 excuse or the ot her 
the Nazi police...not the regular
 police...the regular police wo
uld intervene when they had 
orders but there was alsovarious police forces, Nazi police forces in various 

neighborhoods of representing va
rious factions which were ferocious. They killed. They 
uh they robbed and that was their goal, and 
we had to protect the those who were being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
17 
 
protected from themsel ves because these, th
ese people sometimes lacked common sense. 
Some times it was useless. It wasn't  enough to 
tell them don't  go out of the houses because 
if you go out of the house they'll take, they 
take you away. They put you in the prisons 
and the Nazis may even kill you, an
d to...that will give us more work to do because we'll 
have to come  and get you and find you and this happened many times. They would go 
and take a wa lk to go find their girlfriend, 
to go find their boyfriend...all these things. Or 
for whatever reasons, their own reasons. 
I even created the committees in each house 
with three members and their job was to be 
concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, 
and to prevent people from leaving the hous
es and going on the streets. They had to 
rema in inside  the houses because there they were
 safe. If they left the houses, they were 
no longer safe. They would take their stars o
ff and they would go outside and there would 
be Nazis there who would ask them for their 
papers and what papers could they show. 
They didn't have any. If they did, it woul
d be clear that they were Jews and 
therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then. And so we had to find uh food 

for them and security besides watching.  We  
were pretty lucky. It was a continuous job 
because we had to travel throughout the nei
ghborhoods continuously to show the flag, to 
show that we were present and continuously...I
 went at least twice 
a day and daringly, I 
went daringly on the streets a
nd little by little with the with
 the car...I woul
d go with the 
car and so the people coul d see the, the uh fl
ag, so the people could 
see that the car was 
guarding them, and therefore and so with tim
e, with the passage of weeks, new houses 
were organized.  We  tried with a hospital t
oo but it was but it failed. The...it was my idea 
but it was a bad idea. It didn't go well. So 
weeks went on. Months went by...sorry...weeks 
went on and at the end of Nove mber we 
were working continuously and the work 
with...the contacts with the author
ities...I didn't, I didn't think 
that you didn't  need to have 
contacts with the author ities. Quite the contrary. I ma de as many contacts as possible. 

I...one day for example I took _____...I don't know
 what that is...I took twenty-five 
thousand ____ to the secretary of the 
mi nister who was very...______...oh, money. OK. 
This is money that he brought to the Hungarian
 uh refugees in Transylvania and Russia 
and Carpetia and the refugees...and this is 
money for the children and he was very 
thankful and every time , every time  I was in
 the neighborhood where he...I went up to see 
him to say hello to him and this gave me  th
e possibility to ask him information all the 
time, how it was going at the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry, for example. For example, since 
Fritz didn't want to go to the Ministry, since 
Fr itz (ph) never left 
the Legation to vi sit a 
house...he never visited any of the houses. He 
didn't know a nything. He wasn't  interested 
even in how many signatures were used with his si gnature pad because he was a diplomat 

and he had uh limited vision. He was an old-timer diplomat. This is a very...what he did 

was very serious and uh correct 
but it would have been a good 
thing in times of peace and 
in normal times when the war was not ideol
ogical as it had become , whe n there was no 
persecution of the Jews. Not only of Jews but also the uh in Hungary there were ma ny 

uh...uh they had orchestras. They played the vi
olins and they had restaurants and they 
played the orchestras and with the violins 
and their famous pe ople...in Hungary and in 
Serbia (ph)..._____. I'm sorry...I can't  find 
the word...you know...these traveling homeless 
kind of people...oh...uh..._____ they, they dress 
in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...gypsies, 

gypsies....thank you. Gypsies.  _____ Gyps
ies. Gypsies. I couldn't find the 

word...sorry...OK.  (Pause) In Belgrade on...day 
and night I we nt to restaurants and I had 

meals and in the evenings they had orchestras. They were played by the gypsies. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
18 
 
there was a beautiful restaurant in 
____ in _____ Square, where there was a good 
orchestra and there were a 
couple of good violinists. One 
day they disappeared, in 
January of '42 I think it was. Yes. January 
of 1942 they disappeared. I asked the owner of 
the restaurant, what happened to the orches
tra, the band. And he said well...at first he 
didn't really want to answer. He was reticen
t, and then he said the Germans took them 

off, because they are of an inferior race.  So
 they persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that 
area were many of them, and the Poles. Not 
only uh Jewish Poles but
 the citizens too, and 
this is something that  I saw. This is not something that I just  heard. I saw it. So, so 

we...this is how we worked, issu
ing these letters of protectio
n and then Sa nspritz left. I 
don't re me mber if he left the 30th of Nove mb
er or December 1st. Uh it seems...I think 
that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me  Nove mber 30th. He told me  Nove mber 

30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this 
or not. Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and that 
morning there was a reaction on behalf of the 
Nazis. I found myself that morning, early in 
the morning I was called...six 
in the morning...and I don't remember who called me  but 
they called me fr om the Legation to tell me th
at Sanspritz had left and so I got up and I I 
visited the international ghetto thinking what 
do I do now?  What is the situation?  And in 
a certain sense the Nazis helped because 
by...when I went in front of the house of 
_______ Street, Number 25, where the child ________ was in this house...he remi nded 

me  of some  details the other day when I sa
w him for the first time .  He recalled some  
details that I didn't reme mber. I saw beside
s...speaking of _____ he exaggerates when I 
say that I uh yelled to the Nazi
s and said get out of here. He 
exaggerates.  As a child, he 
thought that that's what I did but
 it wasn't  quite like that, but anyhow that's  how he saw it. 
That's  his mentality. More or less that's  how
 it was, but I wasn't  screaming. I wasn't  
yelling. So I saw...I entered this house a
nd I said, what is happening here. They 

were...they told us oh they want to take us 
away. The police want to deport us. And sure 
enough the regular police was there. Not the 
Nazis, the regular pol
ice was there which 
was comma nded by a lieutenant, and I asked this
 lieutenant, what do you want. I've got to 
take everyone away. And I closed the door in fr
ont of him. I locked 
it, and I said look, no 
one is leaving. The Spanish flag is here. Th
e Spanish emble m is he
re. This...we consider 
this house extra-territorial prope
rty. It wasn't  legal. It wasn
't  right, but what governs such 
governme nts, you could just say...you could ma ke
 up things like that. It couldn't have 
been an extra-territorial house. You needed
 special permission from the government. The 
governme nt had not given any special permission
 to do that, and so we discussed and we 
reached an agreement that he would postpone 
the...and together we would go to the park, 

in the center of the park, where ther e was 
a committee composed of various police forces, 
the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministr
y, the Interior Minist
er and I don't know who 
else...seven or eight people. And I went there 
to speak with these people and I spoke with 
energy and with boldness because if I went ther
e with my hat in hand and I said hey, they 
would say hey, this guy doesn't  know what 
he's doing. You had to assert yourself, 
especially with the Hungarians because thes
e pe ople are, are tough people and you had to 
be just as tough, and he said...I asked hi
m what's  happening, why do you want to take 
these uh people away. He said because Sanspr
itz fled. Who said that
 he fled?  Sanspritz 
took a trip. He went to Bern where he is 
going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German 
and Swiss diplomats to discuss the situati
on, but then he is comi ng back. But in the 
meanti me  I am his...the legal representati
ve of the Spanish governme nt and charge 
d'affaires and I showed him my passport a
nd my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
19 
 
Affairs Minister representative said yes, this
 ma n is uh right what he said, so that's the 
way it was. The only thing is that uh Sanspritz 
really did leave. He did flee, and he didn't  
have any intentions of comi ng back. So much so
 that he didn't  even tell me  that he was 
leaving. He didn't tell me anythi
ng. Nothing at all. He left. And I learned about it when he 
was already at the border.  He 
left at four or five in the 
morning. Anyway, but that's  not 
important. Perhaps it was a good thing. It 
was a good thing, because the Nazis uh had 
invaded that house and it gave me  the opportunity
 to present myself 
as the successor to 
the ma n who they thought had escaped, so th
e representative of the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry said OK. You'r e  right. 
The situation is legal.  Uh and 
I said look, there's a flag at 
the Legation. There's a flag at
 all the houses too, and he sai
d...we had an agreement that 
after two or three days I would go to the Fore
ign Affairs Minister Mi
nistry to clarify the 
Spanish position and in fact this is what ha
ppened, but when I went back to the Legation, 
I found that the Swedish Danielson (ph) Mini
ster who was Wallenberg's boss had been to 
the Legation. Danielson wanted to get so
me mone y...some Swiss francs. They'r e about 
seventeen thousand Swiss francs which we
re in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I 
protested at...this is ____ who 
is the Chancellor, and I said
 what do we do now. We  s till 
had some  ____, some  money left and not very
 much. She didn't  know what to do and she 
said that he said that he 
would send a secretary every morn
ing, a Swedish secretary to see 
that everything was uh alright, and I saidno, please, don't do that. I called Minister 

Danielson. I begged him not to send anyone a
nd that and that I would go and see him 
later on to explain the situation and I'm I we
nt probably the ne xt day or so, because if 
Sweden uh protected the interest of the Spanis
h Legation, that meant th
at the interest of 
the Spanish Legation would no longer exist.
 So we continued to work.  ________. The 
situation in the houses came  back to norma l a
nd while I was there in the park I saw that 
there was a column of Jews that were bei
ng deported and I saw that some one was waving 

and so I went to see and I saw that these were
 some of the people protected from another 
houses of the same  street, the _____ Street, of 
Number 33 which was very close, and so I 

ma de the m give me  back. The situation in 
the houses was probably, was pretty norma l 
and peaceful. I don't know what those questi
ons refer to. (He hasn't  understood the 
question.) There were...you mean...are you referri
ng to the quantity of people who were 
there, the sleeping conditions, the eati
ng conditions...what ar
e you referring to?  
___________. In during December, the first ten da
ys of December, we took some  other 
houses...the last two houses, it seems to me . Bu
t the...from a point of view of the living 
conditions it was a very difficult situation a
nd the  ______ house, there 
were five hundred 
people. ____ told me  that th
ey slept on the step
s. I don't reme mber exactly even though 
there was a committee that held the list of 
all the people who arrived every day, but I 
don't re me mber how ma ny there were exactly, because...I must step forward here. The 

morning that the Russians arrived, I burnt ev
erything, even the lists of those who were 
protected because you never know. If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the 

GPU...you don't know how they could have in
terpreted this fact, so we destroyed 
everything. The Chancellor didn't want to. She wa
nted to save a few things, and I said no. 
Everything will be destroyed because  nothing sh
all be left in the hands of the Russians 
because the Russians, the same day entered 
the Legation as I expected, had predicted. 
And then they uh then they burnt it...they
 dama ged it but I left. The situation was 
difficult. As far as living condi
tions it was also difficult for the food. It was difficult for 
the hygienic conditions. It was difficult to fi
nd me dicines. There was a difficult time , for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
20 
 
example, because they ha d tried to close 
the water supply in some  of the houses. The 
Nazis had tried to do this and so I proteste
d with vigor. I went to the police commander 
and I demanded that the water be returned. Th
ese things cannot be done because if there 
is a prot ection, then these people must have the 
necessary elements to survive. If there is 
no water, I don't know what would have happe
ned. With five hundred people and and if it 
were sixty or seventy...I don't know how, what
 would have happened. And then there was 
the problem of food. We had to
 feed these people. At a cer
tain point there was no more 
money left from the Legation...this was Hunga
rian money in the Legation. I spent some  
of my money that I had in my pockets but 
I didn't have that much and you had to buy on 
the black ma rket, and so I went to the 
Jewish Council, _________, and they gave me  
some  money and then they didn't have any left
 either . They, they were just in terr ible 
conditions.  They had nothing left
 to eat themselves. I must uh say that in the month of 
August, _______ had fired the Nazi governme nt a
nd one of the first me asures that was 
taken was that the star be no longer worn a
nd all the racial laws were being dismantled 
and brought down, and so ma ny people went back
 to the villages wh
ere they had lived. 
Not everyone lived in Budapest. 
Some of them lived in villages. In Carpetia (ph) for 
example, in Buchovina (ph). They were farmers. The, the Jewi sh, the Jews of that area 

were farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do. They forced uh these Jews 

from the countryside to come  back to B
udapest and...those who had left Budapest...and 
they concentrated them in the old ghetto, which could support ma ybe two, three million 

people...not fifty or si
xty...two or three thousand peopl
e, not fi fty or sixty thousand 
people, and so there was this black, terribl
e hunger. There was...there were infections. 
There were diseases. They was cold. There was no electricity. There, there was nothing. 

They had nothing to eat.  And so this uh Je
wish Council also ran out of mo ney and once 
it ran...once they ran out, I ran 
out too, and with what I ha
d I could buy some thing from 
the black ma rket and specifically I had to be
 careful with...watch the children because we 
had two orphanages which were really not our
s but one belonged to the International Red 
Cross I think and one belonge
d to the Swedish Red Cross 
and the Spanish Legation had 
been begged to protect, protect and to take ca
re of these two houses, and here I must open 
a parent hesis because the trut h is the trut
h after all. On the black ma rket I bought 
condensed milk with the symbol of the In
ternational Red Cross. And we had uh...it was 
very expensive.  We  had to pay for it dear
ly on the black ma rket, but there were ma ny 
children. There were children in the two or
phanages and there were children in the 
houses, the protected houses. And since th
e Jewish Council which whose name  was 
__________, _____, which means Jewish Council, si
nce this uh Council didn't have any 

money left, wasn't  giving any mone y any mo
re, since I had nomi nated a committee for 
each house to ma intain the discipline and 
hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I 
charged these committees to spy uh financiall
y, economically. They sa
id...they would tell 
me  which people could give money. And so 
I went to these people...not every day...and I 
said give me  a thousand ____. You can give me
 five thousand, near five...according to 

their capabilities. A
nd these people gave me  money. 
But somebody would say, why. Why 
should I give you mone y?  And I would say because you have the money. We  need the 

money. I don't have any. The Legation doesn't  
have any. Wha t ...what will we use to buy 
food with. And then we discovered thanks 
to the spying activities that the committee 
undertook that there were some fa milies that ha
d reserves of food that were bountiful and 
there was a time  when we just couldn't  fi
nd anything on the black market anymore, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
21 
 
so I had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these fa milies ha d. And this food was 
distributed because I don't  know wha t  woul
d have  happened. There would have been 
fights because hunger is hunger. A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her 

child...uh she sees the ch
ild get weaker and weaker every 
day...she's  capable of killing 
and she's right, don't you think?  And so ther
efore with these stor
ies...uh these stories 
occurred day after day, week 
after week, and we finally co
me  to the day of Christmas 
Eve, which was a terrible day...because th
e Russians, Russia and Spain considered 
themselves in a state of war. Anyhow, I alwa
ys kept quiet. Yes...ye
s... it's started. Uh 
Christmas Day I reme mb er that  I left. On Ch ristmas Eve, on Christma s Eve I left. I spent 

uh...that evening and I we nt to the villa in Buda
pest. It was in late 
afternoon and I thought 
that I would eat there but wh
en I arrived in the neighborhood I found that there were 
elements of the Hungarian army
 with machine guns and other arms and so forth, and they 
told me  that it's not possible to pass through 
because the Russians ar
e very close, three 
hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told th
em that I have to go. I'm, I'm a diplomat 
and I have to go to the, all the people of th
e Spanish Legation, which was very close, a 
hundred me ters from here, and they said OK, we'l l give you fifteen mi nutes and then you 

have to come  back. Otherwise it's uh your busin
ess. I said OK. So I went and I found that 
everything was topsy-turvy. We  had sixty refug
ees in the villa of the Legation and, and I 
understood that I didn't have time to have lunch 
there, that I had to go back to Budapest. 
They, they ha d ma de a big Christma s tree for 
me. It was big because they had...they cut it 
down from t he park and it was six or seven 
me ters high and you would enter the first 
floor and you would go down to the second...the
 living room and it was all...it was a 
Christma s tree that was, that
 took up two floors and was full 
of presents and I looked at 
the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my pr
esents, because I said if I take my stuff, I 
am letting them know that the Russians are he
re, that there's going to be some  fighting 
here and that we don't know what the German
s would have done and so forth and so I 
just said goodbye to everyone and I left. A
nd I went back to Budapest. I was...didn't go 
back to the villa because the next  day it wa
s burnt by a German grenade. That evening, 
which was Christma s Eve, which is a holiday 
in Spain too...it's...there's  a big supper on 
Christma s Eve and I had been invited to l
unch at the ____ Hotel by the Secretary of the 
Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I fear
ed that with this invitation he wanted to 
ask me  to pay for the Spanish passports. They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I 

gave the Spanish passports to them.  That's now
 true. It's not true. 
If they had asked it 
from me, I don't know what I would have
 done. I would have judged...assessed the 
situation at the time and I would have uh d
ealt and I would have...uh 
practically I would 
have sold the passports in exchange for guara
ntees for security for the protected people. 
So we lunched together and we spoke about
 everything except politics. We joked around, 
and at a certain point we had finished our 
lunch and a courier arri
ved which gave him, 
gave the mi nister some thing...just like in th
e movies. And I think that this...on this piece 
of paper there was written that he had to l
eave and in fact he told me ...look, I'm sorry but 
I have to leave and so forth. So we left
. And I was happy because he didn't  ask me  
anything. He  didn't...he didn't ask anything a
bout the passport, which was a delicate 

question to hand over a passport. Yes, I did have
 passports to give, but if if the question 
became known and the Spanish government found out that that the pa ssport had been 

given to a Nazi mi nister, the Spanish gove rnme nt undoubtedly would have reacted, and 

they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not
 authorize this. He's not authorized to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
22 
 
give out passports, so I was 
glad that he didn't ask me  
anything. Even though there are 
Hungarian newspapers that say th
at I gave uh passports to Nazi 
mi nisters, that's  not true.  
In fact, during the trials they
 didn't br ing this up, so I was alone because I didn't even 
want an escort that evening. I said  I wa
s going to go to dinner that evening and he 
would...and I just need some one to take me  to
 some...to the Legation or to my apartme nt 
and that's all, because I ha d ma ny places where I could go and sleep. At a certain point , I 
was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazi
s, who asked me  to see my passport and 
they said that this passport and diploma
tic pass are no longer valid. And during this 

conversation I saw on the other side of the st
reet a uh army elements, a pa...army patrol, 
and so I called them and the patrol came  and it was comma nded by a lieutenant who 

commanded thirty me n or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me  and this is 

my na me . These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no. You can't  

touch this man. He's a diplomat. He represents
 Spain and so he sent them away, and so 
they escorted me  home . And I decided that I 
would go spend the night in an apartment in 
uh _______, in _______ Street, _______ Street. I invite
d this lieutenant to come  and have 
a drink with me  and he told me , declared to 
me  that they were about to close...they we re 
about to close the neighborhood and there was 
only one street open left, and that's  why I 
understood that the mi nister who had been in 
such a hurry to leave. And so the next 
morning I tried to get in touch with the vi
lla, because I had left two cars there and I 
needed those cars. One belonged to Sansprit
z and another had been lent to me  that 
morning by an Italian citizen because the onl
y two cars that I had 
in the Le gation were 
not working, and so he lent me  this car and 
the next day the car wa
s burnt in the village. 
The whole villa was destroyed. Nothing was le
ft. Of my stuff, one
 girl saved five 
handkerchiefs that she had wanted to save me
, but she didn't want to hang them on the 
tree. She didn't  want to hang the handkerchief
s on the tree with everything else and this 
girl came to the house at the last mi nute 
before the house burnt and she uh got the box 
with the handkerchiefs and af
ter three months, she came to 
Budapest to give me  the 
handkerchiefs. That mor ning...that Christma s mo
rning was a terrible mor ning.  Spain...I 
don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared fo
r the Slovak mi nister. Bohemi a had been 
annexed by Germany but Slovakia was indepe
ndent and so they had a diplomatic 
representative in Budapest. This diplomatic
 representative who had contacts with the 
Spaniards...I don't know how...I don't  reme mber
...but anyhow with, t
ogether with the 
attorney Fakash went to look for him to br
ing him to the Legation. 
We found him.  He 
was dead, in the garden before the gate of
 the Legation. The Nazis had killed him bec a use 
they had discovered that he was anti-Nazi. When
 I returned they wanted to take attorney 
Fakash away from me . They wanted him to l
eave the car and if he left the car, that was 
the end. I wa s able to bring him back to th
e Legation and I told hi
m you're not to leave 
this Legation again. I will go al one. I will be 
escorted by the police forces. I will go alone 
and you remain here because your life is in 
danger. So I...the days...that's how the days 
passed after Christma s. By New Ye ar's  Eve 
it was calm, especially in the evening. We 
even danced...sure...we danced in the baseme
nt of the Legation. We  even brought out 
some  bottles of Spanish wine. There were
 hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious 
Spanish wine from  _______, bottles of ______ wi
ne from these areas in Spain which is 
precious wine. I liked it anyhow and I used to
 drink it all the time  in Spain. And they 
danced. They even danced. I was happy because these people who were in hiding...and 

they were all Jews except for one who saidhe was a priest, but I don't think he was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
23 
 
priest. I think that he was 
a priest who was pretending...uh 
a Jew who was  pretending to 
be a priest I think, but I never 
saw him again these are not details
 that really interested me  
since they did not come  into the offices. Th
ey came  only for...in th
e last moment when 
we were asleep in the baseme nt together a
nd that's  when we had this party and that's  
when I saw them. I, I always thought...I'm act
ually glad that I didn't have any contact 
with them. You know, we'd just say hello and good evening and that's  it. There was a 

Hungarian diplomat, ________, who had a wife
 and daughter...uh ma ny people.  There 

was sixty or so people, and they even dance d. And then the situation began to get worse. 

So we still continued to issu
e those letters of protection 
because the Nazis, Hungarian 
Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when 
I speak of Nazis I always refer to the 
Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what 
did I want to say...where was I...where was 
I...OK. The first few days of January we 
heard some  rumors a ccording to which it 
seemed that they wanted to take away all 
of the Jews from the international ghetto and 
take them to the old grand ghetto and deport th
em. I didn't believe in 
such a thing because 
they were saying that Minister _____ who was 
in charge of the civi
lians and military for 
the seized (ph) capital, they were saying th
at he was going to burn the ghetto and and kill 
all the Jews. This would have been the fina
l Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in 
such a thing. In the meantime new letters we
re being issued, not very ma ny but there was 
always someone who felt threatened because 
they had inspected the house next door or 
the apartment above...you know how it is. So on
e day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or 
the sixth of January...I don't re me mb er exactl
y...probably the fifth or 
the sixth of January, 
I was crossing Mussolini Square to go to th
e orphanages which were very nearby and I 

saw a column of Jews passing by and so I as
ked, who are these Jews?  And they say, these 
are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews
. That night, during that du
ring the night the Portuguese 
mi nister had sent an employee of his to ask me
 orally to assume  the responsibility for the 
Portuguese Legation and I told hi
m no, that if there is some th
ing, if there is some thing...if 
he can come  and explain to me , then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I I 

didn't...I couldn't assume  any more responsib
ilities. I'd had enough 
of my own, and so I 
saw that they took away all those Portuguese
 Jews and so I understood that that had 
already, ma n had already abandoned everythingor he was about to abandon everything 

because he was the Portuguese mi nister bu
t he was a Hungarian citizen. He was the 
____________. __________ was his name , but he was a 
Hungarian citizen, but he was 

acting as Portuguese mi nister and therefore th
at ma n said he had abandoned everything, 
that he was stepping back and that he cons idered uh that he couldn't do anything more.  

So I wrote a letter to this mi
nister and I...where I wrote that
 I had heard these rumors, that 
I didn't believe in them, that please to de
ny these rumors but he didn't respond and after 
two days I wrote him....actually
 no...I telephoned and I said th
at I was about to come  to 
see him...that I would come  see hi m the next da
y and I think that was 
January 8 or the 7th 
or the 8th of January. Probably the 8th. Perh
aps even in the night
. Who knows. Anyway, 
it's not that important. So he went there thatday. I went because I 
had heard these rumors 
which were more and more prevalent and th
en I saw, when I saw the column of the 
Portuguese Jews I was struck and I we nt and I found in uh the chamber of t he city hall 

Budapest, in the baseme nt, I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and _____ who was Swiss. 

And I told them I 'm going to go inside fi
rst because I have an appointme nt. My 
appointme nt...it hadn't really been conferred to
 me  that I had an appointme nt but uh and 
when I return from the appointme nt then we 
can all talk together. The colonel uh who is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
24 
 
head of the gendarmerie, ________ accompanied me
 to the mi nister's office. It was a 
little offi ce in the basement and this colonel 
three days later killed himself by the way. He 
saw that everything was lost. He'd been comp
romised because of th
e Jewish question and 
so he killed himself. Sada 
(ph) was his name . Colonel Sada and he was the head of the 
whole gendarmerie of Hungary at 
that time , so I went to this 
mi nister that I had seen, not 
known, but I had seen him in the past and very ca
lmly he said yes. He wanted to solve the 
Jewish question by killing everyone. And so 
I started to say do you realize what's 
happening and do you realize what's  going to 
happen, that the H
ungarian people will 
have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you 
know...I even talked about the Myian (ph) civi
lization and everything 
that came to mi nd, 
____ people...anything to move him.  I even cried. Uh but he was tough so I didn't know 

what to do anymore. I, I can't  just leave th
e situation like this, I 
thought to myself, so I 
told him, look...if within forty-five hours th
e Spanish governme nt does not receive fr om 
me a guarantee that all is calm 
and that the agreements betw
een...the agreements with the 
Hungarian governme nt have been respected 
because during the period between October, 

November and December we had come to 
an agreement with the Foreign Affairs 

Minister and the Hungarian government...we 
had reached an agreement and received 
guarantees.  Not only that but the Hungarian
 government wanted to send a diplomatic 
representative to Madrid in or
der to, to tie diplomatic rela
tions with the Anglo-Americans 
to see in, in, in view of th
e peace treaty, and logically the Spanish governme nt who di dn't 
wish to recognize the Nazi governme nt, didn't wa
nt to hear anything about it. The, the uh 
credentials, the request for 
credentials...he's explaini
ng uh this...what credentials 
are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of
...this request for credentials to Madrid. It 
was for a certain Colonel _____.  I di dn't tran
smit them because if I did the Spanish 
government would probably say that that th
ey that they di dn't accept it because they 
didn't recognize the government while 
until then the governme nt, the Spanish 
governme nt kept quiet. They kept quiet.  Al
so the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last 
night told me that he saw in the archives
 ma ny telegrams from the Hungarian government 
which asked the Spanish governme nt if I was 
really the charge d'affaires. The Spanish 
governme nt never answered. The Spanish amba
ssador told me  that last night. They 
never...the Spanish governme nt never re
sponded to these telegrams. I understood 
naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we
 had a preferential 
treatment with the 
Hungarian government and this was because th
ey wanted to have diplomatic relations 
with Spain to contact the Anglo-Americans.
 We understood it late, 
but we understood it.  
If we understood it imme diately, ma ybe two mont
hs earlier because we'r e already talking 
about the beginning of November...had we 
understood it earlier, two months ago, we 
would have behaved differently and perhap
s some thing more could have been done I 
think but uh we'r e not...we weren't that intellig
ent after all.  The Spanish ambassador told 
me  not that...not everyone is intelligent. I wasn
't  intelligent. The ot
her the other guy also 
wasn't  intelligent so uh what do you want. So I 
told him that if with
in forty-five hours the 
Spanish government doesn't  get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order 

the three thousand Hungarian citizens whic
h are, who are in, in Spain will be 
interned...actually there were really a hundr
ed including the diplom
ats...and their goods 
will be se ized and this, the Spanish govern
me nt will...or ask the Brazilian governme nt 
and the Paraguayan governme nt to do the same  
with those Hungarian citizens who were 
in Brazil and Paraguay. So this mi nister 
said a friendly governme
nt like the Spanish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
25 
 
governme nt would do such a thing? What 
friendly governme nt?  If you are against us, 
you're the ones who are against us. This is what
 we want. We want to
 protect these Jews. 
You don't want to do it, so you are comi ng ag
ainst our interests a
nd against our policy 
and against our interests and our wishes, so
 how can you say that we are friends. We 'r e 
friends if you say, if you do what we want. To sum it up he said, OK. The Spaniards are, 

are excluded from the liquidation, will be excl
uded from the liquidation and so I said no, 
and I became uh demanding in that moment. 
I said no.  All...everyone or nobody. All of 

those in the international ghetto must remain 
where they are or  all those in the common 
ghetto must be, must have electricity and wate
r, so forth again, because those people have 

to survive too because what would what would ha ppen of the Hungarian people, so I 

repeated to him again and all the stories 
about vendettas, terribl
e vendettas and uh the 
Anglo-Americans uh who would come  to bomb
ard the city and so forth and so on. And 
so we agreed that everything would have uh oc
curred in that way. When I left the office I 
found Wa llenberg and _____ were still there, and 
I explained the situation to them and I 
said I was able to obtain this and that.When you do inside I don't know what you can ask 

of this mi nister, but please don't uh do anyt
hing to undermine this agreement that we've 
just come  to. Otherwise nothing more...so Wa
llenberg asked me for political asyl um in 

the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wa
it for you. You go to the Legation. I'll wait for 
you and I'm going to have to go find some thing in the neighborhood and then I'll I'll meet 

you there at the Legation. He said no.  I will 
come  with my car in the afternoon. I'll give 
you the car  because I know you need a car, 
and I'll come . I never saw him again. Never 
saw him aga i n. I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he was on ____ 

Street. I know this for sure, and he had left 
the house at ten in the morning to go I don't 
know where. From then on he disappeared. Now 
since the since historians say that on the 
16th he went to ______ at the Russian command 
and that he was taken prisoner there. I 
say that's not true  because  on the morning of the 18th he was in Budapest in the on the 
____ Street. _____ means king. I don't  know real
ly...I saw him ma ybe a dozen times. I 
spoke to him specifically during the meetings 
with diplomats. I never saw him otherwise. 
From the beginning of December, all the dipl omats, mutual diplomats, had disappear ed. 

He couldn't find any of them. Wallenberg... 
when I saw Wa llenberg at city hall in 
Budapest on the meeting, the day that I me t _____, uh I'd seen him, besides that time, I'd 

seen him on December 22nd at the uh Papal Nuncio (ph) where he had signed a 

document uh to protest uh and this was in favor
 of wome n a nd I reme mb er that he did not 
sign that document because he couldn't  sign 
it because he was a secretary and Minist er 
Danielson, his boss, was there. The ambassador. 
His, his boss wasn't  there at that time . 
Uh that morning during the meeting I told
 the Archbishop Angelo _____ I would like to 
speak privately with you and so we went in
to another office and 
so I told him look...I 
started speaking to him in Italian. In the m
eetings we always spoke in French. Uh I 
started speaking in Italian. I said look, I'm not
 a Spaniard. I'm Italian and I'm close to you 
because I'm,  I was born in Komo (ph) and he 
had also been born close to Komo. He said 
oh, you're...you're kidding. You're joking. I said 
no, no. I'm not kidding. This is the truth. 
I tell you this because if some thing would 
ever happen to me, you...I want you to know 
this so that you can uh te
ll my relatives. He told me , I re me mber, don't tell ______. _____ 

was his secretary because that guy is very 
picky. He can...he mi ght become  very angry, 

mi ght cause trouble. I said no no. I won't te
ll ______. And this...practically this is where 
the stor y ends because after a few days
...no, actua lly the next morning, Mr. ____, Mr. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
26 
 
____ sent an employee to ask for telegrams to send to Madrid because we  didn't have a 
radio. The capital was under siege and it wa
sn't ...we couldn't communicate with Vienna.  
Nor mally you could telephone Vienna, Vienna
 telephoned Be rlin, and Berlin via radio 
communicated to Madrid. But this...it was no 
longer possible to use the phone. And so I 
sent this employee to ask for a telegr am wh
ich uh I asked him to send via radio radio 

because he ha d a radi o. Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who was an attorney who was 

very picky, an old-timer, uh told me  that I 
shouldn't  send the telegram and I told him 
look, if I don't send the telegram as soon as
 this employee goes back to Minister _____, 
everythi ng will fall apart. If we send the telegram
 we'll save four or fi ve days. We 'll gain 
four or five days because  the Spanish governme
nt will of course have to reflect on this 
before responding. They're not going to 
respond immediately obvious
ly. The telegram 
will be send today. I don't know if it'll arrive 
immediately in Madrid
 and who will receive 
it in Madrid. It has to be sent
 to Bern and this takes time. 
I wrote to Bern. I wrote to the 
embassy in Bern. After two or three or four 
days the...Madrid sent 
its response thanking 
uh thanks and it said that it was sure  th
at the Hungarian government would have 

respected the agreements and so forth and so on. The employee came to deliver the 

telegram himself and he  said th
at the mi nister was very satisfi
ed with the telegram and so 
forth.  And then one time some thing happened wh
ich is a little bit funny but at the same  
time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it ga
ve me , made me a little bit anxious. I we nt 
to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. This was 
at the end of December. I think before 
Christma s I went to the Foreign Affairs Mini
st ry and I entered the antechamber where the 

secre...permanent secretary ha
d his office. He was like a Vice Minister with whom I 'd 
had contact. His name  was _____, and I saw th
at there were two me n seated on a couch 
who were waiting and one of them I I recogn
ized. He was the Chancellor of the Italian 
Legation, the Royal Italian Lega
tion, and the other gentlema n I didn't know who he was, 
so I very boldly...I had to very boldly salute
 them like this and in
stead of going to the 
secretary who sort of looked at me  with su
rprise, I went to to 
the door. I pretended to 
knock.  I went inside and to see this Vice 
Minister. I did what I had to do and after 
four...after fifteen mi nutes or
 so I left. I said goodbye to the young lady and I ma de a a 
vague signal with my ha nd like this and I left
. But once I arrived in the in the hallway I 
really came back and I started to eaves...eav
esdrop and I heard that these two people 
entered the office and entered the Vi ce Minister
's office so I entered the area too, and I 
asked Mrs...the young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize th
ese  two me n and she  said 
the big ma n is Minister Gratanzi
 (ph) of the Social Republic 
of Italy and the other is his 
secretary. He was the he was a fascist mi nister, the Social Republic...the Fascist Social 

Republic. On the 16th...in the meantime between the...on the 13th it wasn't  possible to 

leave the Legation anymore. We still had te
lephone communications with which I could 
control or check on the va rious houses, not di
rectly because there were no phones in the 

houses but there were Christians who lived uh in
 front of the houses or next to them, t he 
houses, and they had agreed to telephone to 
us if there was danger and for example with 
Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 
4th or 5th or whatever
 it was. I think she 
told me  even...I think she even told me ...any
way they, they reme mber more than I do. 
She called me  and I we nt over there 
at three in the morning. Anyhow, ___________, 
_______.  There wasn't ...no...it wasn't  just that time . That ha ppened ma ny times, ten or 

fifteen times. Al most every evening I had to 
get up and go because the Nazis wanted to 
come  and take them awa y, to take the Je
ws away from the houses.  ______...speaking. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
27 
 
told them that we had agreements with th
e Hungarian government and so forth and so on 
and in the meantime somebody well from my en
tourage...I alwa ys had an entourage. I 
always had four police officers and two e mploy
ees of the security office and in reality I 
always traveled with two people but...two po
licemen and two public security people, and 
they never wanted to leave my side and when
 I left there were two policemen who left 
and the Legation too...I...I felt li
ke I was a me dieval cavalier w
ith the flag and the banner 
whenever I traveled with them. But anyway 
this normally happened at night and I would 
go on foot because it was dangerous to go by car 
at night. There weren't very ma ny lights. 
But anyhow that night, that la
st night that I went to Ev
a Long in let's say Eva Long's 
house...I didn't  know Eva Long at the time. I me
t  her only three years ago.  I...I arrived 
five mi nutes after a ma n had thrown himself 
out of the window from the fifth floor and 
you asked me how I, how could I prevent th
em from taking them a way and I would tell 
them that we had agreements and then at th
e same  ti me  one  of my escorts would go to a 
telephone and telephone the 
police commando and the Colonel ______ would intervene. 
This is some one who had helped me , because 
I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis, 
non-Nazis.  It doesn't  matter that he was a N
azi who...he was a Nazi but
 he was useful so 
I had contacts with him and there was a H
ungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard. If I 
asked him for some thing, he would do it for me . You understand. Now I had contacts 

with him. I had contacts with
 everyone. Whoever happened to
 be there, I had contacts 
with because that's how you had to operate.  Experience taught me  that everyone can be 

useful. There's some  who do big favors and 
some who do s maller favors. Some  could 

intervene for this and some  could intervene 
for that reason. The Foreign Affairs Minister 
could intervene for that and the Interior Mini
ster could intervene for this and the Nazi 
Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the st reet 

where the Le gation was...at the very end of
 the street...the str
eet was three hundred 
me ters long, there was a Russian tank with 
the mouth of the cannon facing the street 
which would shoot any time it saw a person 
and so who dared to
 leave and go on the 
street . In or der to cr oss the street from
 the Legation to the ____ Paraguayan Legation 
which was...you had to open the door and dash, ma
ke a dash to get to 
the other side.  And 
as soon as you did the, the tank would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in 

telephone contact with the houses because as I 
said there were always Christian friends 
who had telephones in neari
ng the houses who were ca
lled. They saw some thing 
abnorma l. For example, that night they cal
led...I don't know who they
 called. After half 
an hour I arrived and I saw that they were a
bout to take them awa
y. I stopped everything 
but unfortunately I arrived five mi nut es afte
r a ma n threw himself out of a window on the 
fifth floor. I thought it was a 
woma n, but Eva Long told me  that it was a ma n. When I 
arrived they had already covered the 
body. The police had covered the body. And I 
thought it was a woma n but in...it was a ma n. 
And so on the 16th uh you arrived in my  
area, on my street and until the afternoon, 
in the afternoon, up until the afternoon they 
had respected extra-territory _____. We took th
e flag down. We put the Swedish flag up. 
We took the emble m, the Spanish emblem do
wn and put the Swedish emblem beca use 
Sweden was supposed to protect Spain's inte
rests. No...because that's the way it's done. 

When one nation cannot have relations with
 another nation, another nation which can 
have relations, it can intervene to protect the 
interests and in fact I think that Sweden was 

able to...after ten or 
twelve days of the Russian's arri
val, to...was able to empty the 
building, the Spanish building. Of that I'm not
 really sure because I was in hiding. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
28 
 
couldn't do anything more. As I was telling 
you about Wa llenberg, on the morning of the 
18th, the Russians took me  and they put me  to
 sweep the streets. ______ Street...I had to 
sweep _____ Street. At a certain point I saw in
 front of a building a ma n whose name  was 
_____ who, who, had been my chauffeur and who had been wounded driving my car. I 
wasn't  there at the time. Uh my...in my 
position where I was seated uh there was a 
policeman who was killed. He...and then the 
car was taken away and then the car was 
found again a few hours later but it wa s destroyed. This ma n has been my chauffeur to do 

me  a favor and at the same  ti me  had, he ha
d also, he had had ties 
with the International 
Red Cross because the de legate of the Inte
rnationa l Red Cross never showed his face. 
The human mi series. So I asked him, did you 
see Wa llenberg. He said yes.  He's  here. 
Please, go, go fetch him. I can't  move  becau
se there's this guy here with a machine gun, 
the GBU guy who, who is forcing me  to sweep
 the street. After fifteen mi nutes or ten 

mi nutes though he came  back. He say no, he's gone
. He left a few mi nutes ago, and this is 

about eleven in the morning, but from then
 on nothing more was heard about Wa llenberg, 
so I, therefore I think that he died or because
 he was hit by a sniper or  because he was hit 
by a German grenade. Uh they 
resisted until the mi d-February 
in the castle of Buda (ph), 
in the hills of Buda, I think, or perhaps he
 me t a group of Nazis, Hungarian Nazis, who 
recognized him and who killed him on the 
spot. There were hundreds and hundreds of 
bodies buried in the snow in the area of the Spanish Legation, Mussolini Square. I think 

that he wanted to cross _____ Street to go 
to the international ghe
tto, I think. Or anyhow 
such...this...a similar declaration was...I ma de 
a similar declaration in
 1962 I think after a 
request that was ma de to me  by the Swedish 
Consulate in Milan. Last year Danielson's 
widow invited me  to her house in the provin
ce of Trento (ph). I was at ______ and when 
we talked about this issue, she told me that
 her husband and the Foreign Affairs Minister 
never believed that Wa llenberg was taken 
to the Soviet Union, 
Russia. Anyhow, some 
people were interested in blow
ing up the issue in good faith but then others kept saying 
things that were not true. As
 far as I was concerned that's what happened. I ma y be wrong 
but that's how it was for me . That 's what I be
lieve. I rema ined three or four months until 
April, May...five months  in Budapest and 
then the Russians uh kicked every...all the 
foreign citizens out. I was trying to get back 
home but they could have
 sent us Italians 
home  with the trains and in ten or twelve hour
s we  would have been to Capezio (ph) or to 
or to the other place, what's it calle
d..._______. Instead they sent us via Bucha_____, 
Istanbul and it took ten days of travel in 
latched up cars and with a hunger that I don't 
want to speak about because we didn't even
 have any money. There was nothing left. I 
didn't have anything. I had only... everything...I 
had only what I was wearing the day that 
the Russians arrived. Everything had been burnt
 at the Legation.  No...yes...at the villa of 
the Spanish Legation in Budapest, at Buda
, and everything else was stolen by the 
Russians. I didn't even have a shaver to shav
e. In those days they had...I had a Gillette 
shaver. Uh we...when we arrived...when I arri ved in Istanbul, I found the...someone who 
had the suitcase that once...a suitcase that 
once had belonged to me  and which had also 
my shaving kit and I said to him I need my 
shaving kit. Luckily th
is person had an extra 
shaving kit.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 
When I returned to Italy I found that my co
mpany had fired me  and, and it was an ugly 
period and I had to even pay for the car that
 I had borrowed from an Italian and the car 
was then burnt and I had to pay for that 
car with my money, but anyway it was a bad 
period, but anyway I ma naged. It's difficult when
 you're forty to change jobs and in a bad 
situation as it was in It aly at the time, the Wa
r of the Mosques (ph) and so forth. It's hard 

to adapt and I once again went to start afre
sh and to find work. I I adapted. Uh I had 
to...in order to put bread on the 
table, and some times I wasn't  
able to do that perfectly but 
after ten years I was successful. My son wa
s born and we'll ____ for all the sacrifices. I 
was able to raise hi m and to settle, settle
 him and now I consider that I'm uh I'm all 
settled. I can't  say that I am 
uh I'm rich, but I live, live. 
I live and I'm happy this way. 
Especially because all of those people who 
had been helped by me  uh looked for me  and 
they celebrated me. The y made me come 
to Wa shington. You're welcomed. If in the 
future, if you need any explanations on a
nything, we can correspond, but you must write 
in Italian. _________________. I don't know wha t  happened. There's a lady here, 

Magadelena (ph), who knew him we ll. She as
ked me  the same thing. Wh at happened?  
And I say at the end of November, I believe, 
before Sanspritz left, 
he disappeared. Since 
he was trying to get to home  in Spain, perhap
s he was able with the passport that he had, 
perhaps he was able to go to Spain. It was di
fficult because he was a 
deserter of the Blue 
Division of Spain which was fighting with the 
Ge rmans. He had fought in these Divisions 
next to, with the Germans. I don't...I can't ...I've tried to find out because he was a very 

nice guy. He was young. He was probably twenty
-two, ma ybe twenty-three. He was a 
very nice guy. He was very helpful. He, 
he gave me  a hand in...several times for 
something.  I reme mber that he came  wit
h, he accompanied me. But at the end of 
Nove mber he disappeared and that day we didn't see him again. Yes. __________, 

Italian. There are some  people who helped 
me  morally, who lives in Germany now a nd 
morally...gave me  moral support. And then ther
e was Attorney Fakash who unfortunately 
died the day that the Russians entered the ci
ty. That was so unlucky for him. He had a 
beautiful daughter who was ten years old. He
 was ma rried. He was Jewish, but I think 
that he converted because he married a 
princess, __________ from Vienna.  Not a royal 
princess. She had the title of a princess but it
 wasn't  a royal title. I don't know exactly 

what...Mrs. __________. No, why. I told you that sh
e helped me  morally. Thanks to you. 
If in the future you need some  explanations, 
I'd love to send, I'd love to send. You can 
correspond with me  in Italy, but please write in
 Italian so that I don'
t need to have it 
translated and so forth. Let me  guess. There we
re, there are ma ny other things that I could 
tell. I keep saying that the day...I keep saying 
that the work did not 
involve just writing 
those letters of protection. On
ce those letters were written, the work to protect these 
people just got started because they had 
to be protected day and night. Wh en I 
slept...Italian..

GIORGIO PERLASCA 
September 5, 1990 
 
Tape #1 
 
Question:  Would you tell me  your name  please? 

 

Answer:  My name  is George Perlasca. 

 

Question:  And you were born where? 

 

Answer:  I was born in Komo
 (ph) on January 31st, 1910. 
 

Question:– 

 

Answer:  You're welcome. 

 

Question:– 

 

Answer:  It's too much for my personality. 

 
Question:   Can you tell us what happened to 
you when you were released from released from 
internme nt and you came  back to Budapest in 1944? 
 

Answer:  I escaped on October 13th, 1944.  It wasn't
 an internment camp.  I had my own room.  
Each person had his own room.  
We ate three times a day and then we had tea in the afternoon 
and they even gave us cigarettes, soap and toot
hpaste and even money.  
And this was according 
to the Geneva  Convention because I was aggregat
ed to the Italian commercial de legation and 
therefore I had uh I was uh I could 
uh have diplomatic uh treatment.  Uh the 13th I left.  The 13th 
of October and I arrived in Buda
pest that evening and the next
 day I don't know what I did but 
on the 15th the armi stice was proclaimed betwee n 
Hungary, Russia, Great Britain and America.  

This was an announceme nt, a terrible announceme nt 
because no one was prepared for it except a 
few people who, who knew questions of state a
nd government.  I was surprised.  I was having 
lunch with an Italian lady who was of the Jewish 
faith and she was ma rried to an Italian diplomat 
and we...she was speechless and I was surprised, 
and I didn't know what to do.  So I, I hid 
because the TV was controlled by the Admi ral 
_____ governme nt and everythi ng else fell in the 
hands of the Nazis and of the Germa ns, Hungari
an Nazis and the German army and their...and 
then I went to hide in a house which belonged 
to a friend of mi ne, uh fa mily friends in the 
______ and from this house I went to a hospital 
to hide because I didn't know where to go 
because from the first evening I slept in a friend's house in ______ who gave me  the keys to his 

apartment.  The next day I discovered that 
the ma id was a German, a  ____, and she was pro-
Nazi and therefore I di dn't  go back to that house because it seemed dangerous to me .  After a 

couple of days in the hospital, 
I spent two more days in hiding.  I was hidden by the land...by the 
landlady in the house where I used 
to live once upon a time, but then
 I realized that the Ugandan 
Hotel that I knew very well was being emptied b
ecause ma ny German officers were leaving with 
their suitcases and I went  to the keeper of the 
building and I asked him if he could give me  a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
31 
 
room and he  said give me a passport and I said
 I don't have any passport anymore.  I don't have 
any more docume nts and he said OK, for two days
 I'll give you a room and then I...so I didn't 
know what to do.  And so therefore the next morn
ing I decided to go to th
e Spanish Legation.  It 
was probably eight in the morning.  I went ther
e and on the way, on the road, and I was on foot, 
on ____ Street which is a big str
eet, I saw that some  Hungarian 
Nazis were chasing a child who 
was probably seven or eight years old.  They reac
hed him and one of them shot the child in the 
back of the head.  I was quite struck by this na
turally and I asked a passe
rby why, what did that 
child do?   Who is he?   And he 
said he's Jewish.  From the roofs of the houses, however, there 
were some  J e ws who we re shooting against the 
Nazis from t he rooftop houses.  But anyway I 
went to the Legation and I found ___ who gave 
me  a passport and I...he said come  tomorrow 
with two photos, and I had two in my pocket which 
I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then 
he gave me  the passport.  And he also gave me  
a letter fr om the Minist er  of Interior  which said 
that the Spanish governme nt two ye ars earlier ha
d granted me  their citizenship because I had 
fought in the civil war and also, 
the letter also sa
id...and that I had asked fo
r a citizenship and the 
letter said that they were not able to locate me
 and that they now found me and I had to assume  
citizenship, Spanish citizenship.   
 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

So we were...with this letter I went
 together with the legal attach
é..we went to the Minister of 
Interior where I changed citizenship.  I can
celed the Italian one 
and I assume d Spanish 
citizenship.  When I returned to the Le gation th
at early morning, it was probably eight or nine 
a.m., and it's  strange that that morning Sanspritz 
(ph) got up at eight a.m., but these were very 
difficult times and people didn't always go to sl
eep.  I saw...thank you...that there was a lot of 
confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the 
entrance and in the co
urtyard, and that ma ny 
of these people who were there had were wearin
g the David Star, Star of
 David, and I asked the 
legal attaché what was happening and he said 
that these were people who are asking for our 
protection, pr otection from the Spanish government 
but right now we 'r e in difficulty because the 
only Christian legation is Sanspr
itz.  And therefore it's  impos
sible to organize an external 
protection and it's it doesn't  ma ke a
ny sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be 
of help, then I...maybe I can do some thing, so we 
went to Sanspritz and I told him I'm available 
if you need me , and he s a id yes.  Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have any 

funds to pay you with and I said I'm not intere
sted because I have enough money to survive on 
my own.  And so I started imme diately.  I star
ted working immediately.  The first few hours I 
must tell the truth....I didn't  know what to do a
nd I didn't know where to 
start, but then after 
speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who wa
s the attorney and also with the Chancellor and 
with other people who were there 
who were all Jews, Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of 
the refugees and so I realized wh
at could be done.  The first thing was to try to get back about 
three hundred people  who had b
een protected by Spain.  They
 had about three hundred, only 
three hundred at that time because the Hunga
rian governme nt had said three hundred, and 
Sanspritz accepted this decision on 
behalf of the Spanish government and this is some thing that I 
didn't, didn't accept immediately at fi
rst so those first two or three 
days my job was to try to find 
those who had been protected, of the three hundred 
protected.  Of the three hundred I was able to 
get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at 
the uh Merchandise Depot, at the train station 
and also by going to the border 
between Hungary and say Austria and Germany, and those who 
had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them bac
k.  It seems to me  we had rented two trucks but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
32 
 
I don't reme mber now how ma ny, or we brought them
 back with the trai
n or we reserved a 
special car...I I don't really reme mber how that happe
ned.  I was with the car.  I had a car.  So I 
started working.  I saved uh...after...oh he wants 
to know if you're going 
to edit it, edit this 
tape..._____...so the episode at thetrain station...you can take it fr
om the other tape and put it 
together, piece it together–The 
first episode that struck me  very much and which opened my 
eyes to what was happening and to how things were 
actually really were, at
 the trai n st ation they 
were loading train cars 
with Jews who were being deported 
because the Hungarian governme nt 
said that it ha d _____ an agreement publicly with the German governme nt to give  thirty million 

uh Jews who would go to work and then we unders
tood that that wasn't  
true, that they were 
going to work.  They were people who were bein
g deported and then we didn't know what would 
happen to them in the end, so much s o that 
Eva Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a 
laborer.  He went on the train 
but on the trip between Budapest
 and the border he understood...I 
don't know how...but he understood that
 it was a trick and so he ju
mped fr om the train and he 
came back to Budapest.  And he came back to
 Budapest to _______.  I don't think that that 
building existed yet but anyway he came  to one
 of the Spanish houses, so...this episode of the 
two twins...at a certain point ther
e wa s a column which was going and we were looking to see if 
anybody was there with Spanish letter
s, and I saw two twins, two kids
 of eleven or twelve years 
old.  They were very handsome  kids, nice kids 
and they were identical and the more I saw the 
more I told myself how is it possi
ble that I, I let them go, and so 
I told these kids, you see that car 
over ther e.  Get in the car.  R
un to the car.  Get into the car.
  Close the door and then the 
chauffeur will know what he has to do.  Maybe 
you would like to hear from me  how I could 
communicate with these people.  At the time 
I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could 
explain myself, I could express myself in H
ungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke 
Hungarian with these children, but
 anyhow these kids went.  One 
Gestapo ma jor came to and he 
wanted the kids back, and I said no.  They were in
 the car.  It's a Spanis
h car and it had a Spanish 
uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license pl
ates and therefore the ca
r was extra(c)territorial 
property.  He  insisted.  He took 
out his gun and then so forth, a
nd next, Wallenberg was next to 
me  and Wallenberg said...told the ma jor, the Ge
rman ma jor, look...this ma n represents Spain.  

You can't ...you can't  commit any violent acts.  He sa
id look.  He's getting in the way of my work, 
and instinctively I replied that youcall this work.  That's  wha t  I asked him.  And so he got even 

more angry.  He wanted the kids back.  And I...at 
that point I saw the situation getting really bad.  
I thought my God, this ma n is crazy.  He could s
hoot us.  He had a big gun, a Mauthauser (ph), a 
big, big gun, but at that point...we were all 
yelling.  I was screaming.  Wa l l enberg, the 
Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, th
e Swiss, the Vatican...everyone in
tervened in the discussion.  
There were ma ny loud voices at the same  ti me  and 
so this colonel, a colo
nel came, an SS colonel 
came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what wa
s happening and he asked the ma jor what was 
happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come 

too for the kids. And so they left.  And then I 
brought these kids home. 
 I brought them to the 
Legation and I was surprised to s
ee that they were really a boy 
and a girl who when they were 
fully dressed you couldn't  tell and they...it was a boy 
and a girl and they were
 perfectly identical.  
The same  he ight, the same  face...e
verything, everything was identical.
  This is an episode that 
struck me  which, which along with the other epis
ode of the child who was killed on the street, 
these two episodes ma
de me  reflect very much.  
It's not that...at the time I really wasn't  fully 
aware of the situation.  Fr om the end of March 
to October 13th, I was not...I had been interned 
away from Budapest in the countryside...I continued my work.  I stopped looking for the three 

hundred people because I got one hundred and fi
fty back and it seemed have understood that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
33 
 
there was nothing more that could be done and so
 I started to organize 
the protection network.  
We had a house.  I don't reme mber where it was.  (Technical conversation)  I don't remember 
which one it was but we did have one house.  
Maybe two houses we had already.  Maybe they 

were ____ wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but
 anyway that's not important.  I started 
organizing by issuing hundreds of
 letters imme di ately.  Letter
s of protection and I would...I 
would let these people come  in.  We  would go to 
the office and type up these letters.  Sanspritz 
didn't know anything because we 
used his signature pad.  He 
didn't know how ma ny.   His job 
was to keep relations with the Foreign Affa irs Mi
nister.  So we issued I think more than two 
thousand five hundred protection...letters of prot
ection in the month of...at the end of October 
and Nove mber.  To be more specific...I couldn't 
be more specific than that.  I think we  ma ybe 
reached three thousand, more or less.  It wasn't  
very easy.  Not only...it wasn't  sufficient to issue 
a letter of protection and to escort these people to
 their house because they 
had to be escorted to 
a building after all.  I had some people who we
re willing to accompany 
these people with thei r 
cars uh as the letters of protecti
on were issued.  There were ca
rs who were available and who 
shuttled back and forth between the Legation an
d the houses where they were going to live and 
they would go back and forth continuously and 
therefore and so we had to uh provide for 
everything.  We had to get them settled.  Normally
 these apartments that we would take, we had 
to pay the rent, but these are de
tails that are of no importance a
nd perhaps we didn't even pay the 
rent.  We  also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to 

take them be cause they did do that.  They did es
pecially they would try to attack those Swedish 
houses and Swiss houses because they had a, a sy
stem of protection which was not correct.  In 
other words, they had given, both of thosecountries had a mi xed committee, Jewish and 

Christian committee which was resp
onsible for issuing letters of 
protection.  To sum it up these 
letters were being sold.  The au
thorities and particularly the N
azis found out about this and so 
therefore every day 
they, they would come  and take uh raid
 the Swiss and the Swedish houses.  I 
think that as far as I know Sweden issued forty 
million letters of
 protection and in its houses it 
had ma ybe three or four thousand people becausethey would come  in the afternoon and the next 

day there would be raids, and this
 is not some thing that I just heard.  They weren't rumors.  I saw 
them with my very own eyes and with Wa lle
nberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that 
kind of stuff.  That's not corre
ct.  These letters are being sold
 and everyone knows about it.  The 
authorities know about it.  Anywa
y, we had to protect to prevent 
that these people be taken.  We  
had to protect them.  Wi th one excuse or the 
other the Nazi police...not 
the regular police...the 
regular police would intervene when they had or
ders but there was also
 various police forces, 
Nazi police forces in various neighborhoods of
 representing various factions which were 
ferocious.  They killed.  They uh they robbed and 
that was their goal, and we had to protect the 
those who were being protected from themselves 
because these, these people sometimes lacked 
common sense.  Some times it was useless.  It wasn't  enough to tell them don't go out of the 

houses because if you go out of the house they'l l ta
ke, they take you away.  They put you in the 
prisons and the Nazis ma y even kill you, and to...tha
t will give us more work to do because we'll 
have to come  and get you and find you and this happened many times.  They would go and take 

a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find th
eir boyfriend...all th
ese things.  Or for whatever 
reasons, their own reasons.  I even created th
e committees in each house with three members and 
their job was to be concerned 
about hygiene, discipline, order,
 and to prevent people from 
leaving the houses and going on the st
reets.  They had to rema in inside the houses because there 
they were safe.  If they left the houses, they we
re no longer safe.  They wo
uld take their stars off 
and they would go outside and there would be N
azis there who would ask them
 for t heir papers 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
34 
 
and what papers could they show.  They didn't have
 any.  If they did, it would be clear that they 
were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand wh
at happened then.   And so we had to find 
uh food for them and security besides watching. We
 were pretty lucky.  It was a continuous job 
because we had to travel throughout the neighbor
hoods continuously to show the flag, to show 
that we were present and conti
nuously...I went at least twice a da
y and daringly,  I went daringly 
on the streets and little by little
 with the with the car...I would 
go with the car and so the people 
could see the, the uh flag, so the people could 
see that the car was guard
ing them, and therefore 
and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new houses were organized.  We  tried with a 

hospital too but it was but it failed. 
 The...it was my idea but it was a 
bad idea.  It didn't  go well.  
So weeks went on.  Months went by...sorry...weeks 
went on and at the end 
of Nove mber we were 
working continuously and the work 
with...the contacts with the author
ities...I didn't, I didn't think 
that you didn't  need to have contacts with the au
thorities.  Quite the contrary.  I ma de as ma ny 
contacts as possible.  I...one day for exam
ple I took _____...I don't know what that is...I took 
twenty-five thousand ____ to the secretary 
of the mi nister who 
was very...______...oh, money.  
OK.  This is money that he brought to the Hunga
rian uh refugees in Transylvania and Russia and 
Carpetia and the refugees...and this is money for 
the children and he was very thankful and every 
time, every time  I was in the neighborhood where 
he...I went up to see him to say hello to him 
and this gave me  the possibility to ask him in
formation all the time, how it was going at the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example.  For ex
ample, since Fritz didn't want to go to the 
Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never 
left the Legation to visit a hou
se...he never visited any of the 
houses.  He didn't know anything.  He  wasn't  intere
sted even in how ma ny
 signatures were used 
with his signature pad because he was a diplom
at and he had uh limited vision.  He was an old-
timer diplomat.  This is a very...what he did wa
s very serious and uh correct but it would have 

been a good thing in times of peace and in norma l 
times when the war was not ideological as it 
had become, when there was no pe
rsecution of the Jews.  Not only 
of Jews but also the uh in 
Hungary there were ma ny uh...uh they had orchestras
.  They played the violins and they had 
restaurants and they played th
e orchestras and with the vio
lins and their famous people...in 
Hungary and in Serbia (ph)..._____. I'm sorry...Ican't  find the word...you know...these traveling 

home less kind of people...oh...uh..._____ they, they 
dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)... 

gypsies,  gypsies....thank you.  Gypsies.  
_____ Gypsies. Gypsies.  I couldn't find the 
word...sorry...OK.  (Pause)  In Belgrade on...day a
nd night I we nt to restaurants and I had me als 
and in the evenings they had orchestras.  They
 were played by the gypsies.  And there was a 
beautiful restaurant in ____ in _____ Square, wh
ere there was a good orchestra and there were a 
couple of good violinists.  One day they disappeare
d, in January of '42 I think it was.  Yes.  
January of 1942 they disappeared.  I asked the ow
ner of the restaurant, what happened to the 
orchestra, the band.  And he said well...at first he 
didn't really want to an
swer.  He was reticent, 
and then he said the Germans took them off, becau
se they are of an infe
rior race.  So they 
persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that area we
re ma ny of them, and the Poles.  Not only uh 
Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and this is someth
ing that I saw.  This 
is not some thing that I 
just heard.  I saw it.  So, so we...this is how  
we worked, issuing these 
letters of protection and 
then Sanspritz left.  I don't re me mbe r  if he left
 the 30th of November or December 1st.  Uh it 
seems...I think that the ambassador, Spanish amba
ssador told me  Nove mber 30th.  He told me  

Nove mber 30th, but I don't know if he's sure about
 this or not.  Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and 

that morning there was a reaction on behalf of th
e Nazis.  I found myself 
that m
orning, early in 
the morning I was called...sixin the morning...and I don't remember who called me  but they 

called me  fr om the Legation to tell me  that Sanspr
itz had left and so I got up and I, I visited the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
35 
 
international ghetto thinking what do I do now?   What
 is the situation?   And in a certai n sense 
the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the house of _______ Street, Number 
25, where the child ________ was in this house...he 
remi nded me  of some  details the other day 
when I saw him for the fi rst time.  He recalled some details that I di dn't reme mber.  I saw 

besides...speaking of _____ he exaggerates when I sa
y that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get 
out of here.  He exaggerates.  As
 a child, he thought that that's  
what I did but it wasn't  quite like 
that, but anyhow that's  how he saw it.  That's  his 
me ntality.  More or less 
that's how it was, but I 
wasn't  screaming.  I wasn't  yelling.  So I saw...I
 entered this house and I 
said, what is happening 
here.  They were...they told us oh 
they want to take us away.  The police want to deport us.  And 
sure enough the regular police was 
there.  Not the Nazis, the re
gular police was there which was 
commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieut
enant, what do you want.  I've got to take 
everyone away.  And I closed the door in front of
 him.  I locked it, and I said look, no one is 
leaving.  The Spanish flag is here.  The Spanish 
emble m is here.  This...we consider this house 
extra-territorial property.  It wasn't  legal.  It
 wasn't right, but what
 governs such governme nts, 
you could just say...you could ma ke up th
ings like that.  It couldn't ha
ve been an extra-territorial 
house.  You needed special permission from the governme nt.  The governme nt had not given any 

special permission to do that, and 
so we discussed and we reached an agreement that he would 
postpone the...and together we woul
d go to the park, in the center 
of the park, where there was a 
committee composed of various police forces, the 
Nazi part y, the Foreign Affairs Mini stry, the 
Interior Minister and I don't know who else...seven
 or eight people.  And I went there to speak 
with these people and I spoke with
 energy and with boldness because 
if I went there with my hat 
in hand and I said hey, they would say hey, this
 guy doesn't  know what he's  doing.  You had to 

assert yourself, especially with the Hungarians 
because these people are, are tough people and 
you had to be just as tough, and he said...I as
ked him what's happening, 
why do you want to take 
these  uh people away.  He said because Sanspritz 
fled.  Who said that he fled?   Sanspritz took a 
trip.  He went to Bern where he is going to
 meet Spanish, Italian, French, German and Swiss 
diplomats to discuss the situation, 
but then he is comi ng back.  But in the meanti me  I am his...the 
legal representative of the Sp
anish governme nt and charge d'affaires and I showed him my 
passport and my diploma tic pass and 
so the Foreign Affairs Minister 
representative said yes, this 
ma n is uh right what he said, so that's  the way it
 was.  The only thing is 
that uh Sanspritz really 
did leave.  He did flee, and he didn't have any in
tentions of comi ng back.  So much so that he 
didn't even tell me  that he was leaving.  He didn't te
ll me  anything.  Nothing at all.  He left.  And 
I learned about it when he was already at the border.  He left at four or five in the morning.  

Anyway, but that's not important.  Pe rhaps it 
was a good thing.  It was 
a good thing, because the 
Nazis uh had invaded that house and it gave me
 the opportunity to present myself as the 
successor to the ma n who they thought had escaped, 
so the representative of the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry said OK.  You're right. 
 The situation is legal. Uh and I 
said look, there's a flag at the 
Legation.  There's a flag at all the houses too, an
d he said...we had an agreement that after two or 
three days I would go to the Fore
ign Affairs Minister Mi
nistry to clarify the Spanish position and 
in fact this is what happened, but when I we
nt back to the Legation, 
I found that the Swedish 
Danielson (ph) Minister who wa
s Wallenberg's boss had been to 
the Legation.  Danielson wanted 
to get some  money...some Swiss francs.  They'r
e about seventeen thousand Swiss francs which 

were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I protes
ted at...this is ____ who is
 the Chancellor, and I 
said what do we do now.  We still had some ____, some money left and not very much.  She 

didn't know what to do and she said that he said
 that he would send a secretary every morning, a 
Swedish secretary to see that everything was uh 
alright, and I said no, please, don't do that.  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
36 
 
called Minister Danielson.  I be
gged him not to send anyone and th
at and that I would go and see 
him later on to explain the situ
ation and I'm I went probably th
e next day or so, because if 
Sweden uh protected the interest of the Spanish 
Legation, that meant that
 the interest of the 
Spanish Legation would no longer exist.  So we
 continued to work.  ________.  The situation in 
the houses came back to normal and while I was th
ere in the park I saw that there was a column 
of Jews that were being deporte
d and I saw that some one wa s wavi
ng and so I went to see and I 
saw that these were some of the people prot
ected from another houses of the same  street, 
the____Street, of Numb er 33 which was very clos
e, and so I made the m give me back.  The 
situation in the houses was probably, was pre
tty normal and peaceful.  I don't know what those 
questions refer to.  (He hasn't  understood 
the question.)  There 
were...you mean...are you 
referring to the quantity of people who were
 there, the sleeping conditions, the eating 
conditions...what are you referring to?   ___________.  
In during December, the first ten days of 
December, we took some other hous
es...the last two houses, it seems to me.  But the...from a 
point of view of the living conditions it was avery difficult situation 
and the ______ house, there 
were five hundred people.  ____ told me  that they
 slept on the steps.  I 
don't re me mbe r  exactly 
even though there was a committee that held the 
list of all the people who arrive d every day, but 
I don't reme mber how many there were exactly, becau
se...I must step forward here.  The morning 
that the Russians arrive d, I bur
nt everything, even the lists of 
those who were protected because 
you never know.  If they fall in the hands of
 the Russians or the GPU...you don't know how they 
could have interpreted this fact
, so we  destroyed everything.  Th
e Chancellor didn't want to.  She 
wanted to save a few things, and I said no.  Ev
erything will be destroye
d because nothing shall 
be left in the hands of the Russians because the 
Russians, the same day entered the Legation as I 
expected, had predicted.  And then
 they uh then they burnt it...they dama ged it but I left. The 
situation was difficult.  As far as living condi
tions it was also difficult for the food.  It was 
difficult for the hygienic conditions
.  It was difficult to find me di
cines.  There was a difficult 
time, for example, because they had tried to cl
ose the water supply in some  of the houses.  The 
Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested w
ith vigor.  I went to the police commande r and I 
dema nded that the water be returned.  These 
things cannot be done because if there is a 
protection, then these people must have the necessary 
elements to survive.  If
 there is no water, I 
don't know what would have happened.  With five
 hundred people and, and if it were sixty or 
seventy...I don't know how, what would have ha
ppened.  And then there was the problem of 
food.  We  had to feed these peopl
e.  At a certain point there wa
s no more money left from the 
Legation...this was Hungarian money in the Legati
on.  I spent some of my
 money that I had in 
my pockets but I didn't have that muc h and you ha d to buy on the black market, and so I went to 

the Jewish Council, _________, and they gave me  some  money and then they didn't have any 

left  either.  They, they were just in terrible cond
itions.  They had nothing le
ft  to eat themselves.  I 
must uh say that in the month of August,  ______
_ had fired the Nazi government and one of the 

first measures that was taken was that the star 
be no longer worn and all the racial laws were 
being dismantled and brought down, and so ma ny pe
ople went back to the villages where they 

had lived.  Not everyone lived in B
udapest.  Some  of the m lived in 
villages.  In Carpetia (ph) for 
example, in Buchovina (ph).  They were farmers.
 The, the Jewi sh, the Jews of that area were 
far mers, and so what did the Germans and the 
Nazis do.  They forced uh these Jews from the 
countryside to come  back to Budapest and...those 
who had left Budapest..
.and they concentrated 
them in the old ghetto, which could support ma
ybe two, three million p
e ople...not fifty or  
sixty...two or three thousand peopl
e, not fifty or sixt
y thousand people, and so there wa s this 
black, terrible hunger.  There was...there were inf
ections. There were diseases.  They was cold.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
37 
 
There was no electricity.  There, there was nothi
ng.  They had nothing to eat.  And so this uh 
Jewish Council also ran out of money and once it
 ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with 
what I had I could buy some thing from the black 
ma rket and specifically I had to be careful 
with...watch the children because we had two or
phanages which were really not ours but one 
belonged to the International Re
d Cross I think and one belonged 
to the Swedish Red Cross and 
the Spanish Legation had been begged to protect
, protect and to take care of these two houses, 
and here I must open a parenthesis because the truth 
is the trut h after all.  On the black market I 
bought condensed milk with the sy
mbol of the International Red Cross.  And we had uh...it was 
very expensive.  We  had to pay for it dearly on 
the black market, but ther
e were many children.  
There were children in the two 
orphanages and there were child
ren in the houses, the protected 
houses.   And since the Jewish Council which whose name  was __________, _____, which 

means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn
't  have any money left, wasn't  giving any 
money any more, since I had nominated a committee for each house to ma intain the discipline 

and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I ch
arged these committees to spy uh financially, 
economically.  They said...they would tell me  whic
h people could give mone
y.  And so I went to 
these people...not every day...and I said give me
 a thousand ____.  You can give me  fi ve 

thousand, near five...according totheir capabilities.  And thes
e people gave me  money.  But 
some body would say, why.  Why should I give  yo
u money?   And I would say because you have 
the money.  We need the money.  I don't have a
ny.  The Legation doesn't  have any.  What...what 
will we use to buy food with.  And then we disc
overed thanks to the spyi ng activities that the 
committee undertook that there were some  fa milies th
at had reserves of food that were bountiful 
and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the black ma rket anymore, and so I 

had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these fa milies had. 
 And this food was distributed 
because I don't know what would have happened.
  There would have been fights because hunger 
is hunger.  A mother who doesn't  have milk 
or food for her child...uh she sees the child get 
weaker and weaker every day...she's  capable of k
illing and she's right, don't you think?   And so 
therefore with these stories...uh these stories o
ccurred day after day, week
 after week, and we 
finally come  to the day of Christma s Eve, which was a terrible day.

Tape #2 
 
...because the Russians, Russia and Spain considered
 thems elves in a stat
e of war.  Anyhow, I 
always kept quiet.  Yes...yes...
it's started.  Uh Christma s Day I reme mber that I left.  On 
Christma s Eve, on Christma s Eve I left.  I spen
t uh...that evening and I we nt to the villa in 
Budapest.  It was in late afte
rnoon and I thought that I would eat 
there but when I arrived in the 
neighborhood I found that there were elements of
 the Hungarian army with machine guns and 
other arms and so forth, and they told me  th
at it's  not possible to pass through because the 
Russians are very close, three hundred, four hundred 
me ters away, and I told them that I have to 
go.  I'm, I 'm a diplomat and I have to go to the,
 all the people of the Spanish Legation, which was 
very close, a hundred me ters from here, and th
ey said OK, we'll give you fifteen mi nutes and 
then you have to come  back.  Otherwise it's uh your business.  I said OK.  So I went and I found 

that everything was topsy-turvy.  
We  had sixty refugees in the 
villa of the Legation and, and I 
understood that I didn't have time to have lunch ther
e, that I had to go back to Budapest.   They, 
they had made a big Christmas tree for me.  It was big because they had...they cut it down from 

the park and it was six or seven me ters high and 
you would enter the firs
t floor and you would go 
down to the second...the living room 
and it was all...it was a Christma
s tree that was, that took up 
two floors and was full of presents and I looked at
 the Christma s tree and I didn't even take my 
presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I a m
 letting them know that th
e Russians are here, that 
there's going to be some  fighting here and th
at we don't know what the Germans would have 
done and so forth and so I just
 said goodbye to everyone and I 
left.  And I went back to 
Budapest.  I was...didn't go back to the villa 
because the next day it was burnt by a German 
grenade.  That evening, which was Christma s Eve, 
which is a holiday in Spain too...it's...there's  a 
big supper on Christma s Eve and I had been inv
ited to lunch at the ____ Hotel by the Secretary 
of the Nazi Party, the Hungarian Na
zi Party, and I feared that with
 this invitation he wanted to 
ask me  to pay for the Spanish passports.  They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I gave 
the Spanish passports to them.  That's now true.  
It's  not true.  If they 
had asked it from me , I 
don't know what I would have done.  I would have
 judged...assessed the situ
ation at the time and 
I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practi
cally I would have sold the passports in 
exchange for guarant ees for security for the prot
ected people.  So we l
unched together and we 
spoke about everything except politics.  We  joke
d around, and at a certain 
point we had finished 
our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, 
gave the mi nister something...just like in the 
movies.  And I think that this...on th
is piece of paper there was written
 that he had to leave and in 
fact he told me ...look, I 'm sorry but I have to le
ave and so forth.  So we left.  And I was happy 
because he di dn't ask me  anything.  He  didn't...he
 didn't ask anything about the passpor t, which 
was a delicate question to hand over 
a passport.  Yes, I did have pa
ssports to give, 
but if, if the 
question became  known and the Spanish governme nt
 found out that that the passport had been 
given to a Nazi mi nister, the Spanish govern
me nt undoubtedly would have reacted, and they 
undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authori
ze this.  He's not authorized to give out 
passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask 
me  anything.  Even though there are Hungarian 
newspapers that say that I gave uh 
passports to Nazi mi nisters, that
's  not true.  In fact, during the 
trials they didn't bring this up, so I wa s alone beca
use I didn't even want an escort that evening.  I 
said I was going to go to dinner that evening a
nd he would...and I just need some one to take me  
to some...to the Legation or to my apartment and that's all, because I had many places where I 

could go and sleep.  At a certain point, I was st
opped by a group of Hungar
ian Nazis, Nazis, who 
asked me  to see my passport and they said that
 this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
39 
 
valid.  And during this conversati
on I saw on the other side of th
e street a uh army elements, a 
pa...army patrol, and so I called them and the 
patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant 
who comma nded thirty me n or so, a nd I said look, th
ese people want to arrest me  and this is my 
name .  Thes e are my documents and papers and 
so they said no, no, no, no.  You can't  touch this 
ma n. He 's  a diplomat.  He represents Spain and so
 he sent them away, and so they escorted me  
home .  And I decided that I would go spe
nd the night in an apartment in uh _______, in _______ 
Street, _______ Street.  I invited th
is lieutenant to come  and have a drink with me  and he told 
me , declared to me  that they were about to cl
ose...they were about to close the neighborhood and 
there was only one street open left, and that's  w
hy I understood that the mi ni
ster who had been in 
such a hurry to leave.  And so the next morningI tried to get in touch 
with the villa, because I 
had left two cars there an
d I needed those cars.  One belonged 
to Sanspritz and another had been 
lent to me  that morning by an Italian citizen be
cause the only two cars th
at I had in the Legation 
were not working, and so he lent me  this car and 
the next day the car was burnt in the village.  
The whole villa was destroyed.  Nothing was left.  
Of my stuff, one girl 
saved five handkerchiefs 
that she had wanted to save me , but she didn't want
 to hang them on the tree.  She didn't  want to 
hang the handkerchiefs on the tree with everything el
se and this girl came to
 the house at the last 
mi nute before the house burnt and she uh got th
e box with the handkerchiefs and after three 
months, she came to Budapest to give me  the 
handkerchiefs.  That morning...that Christma s 
morning was a terrible morning.  Spain...I don't 
know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the 
Slovak mi nister.  Bohemi a had been annexed by 
Germany but Slovakia was independent and so 

they had a diplomatic representative in Budape
st.  This diplomatic 
representative who had 
contacts with the Spaniards...I don't know how
...I don't reme mber...but anyhow with, together 
with the attorney Fakash went to
 look for him to bring him to 
the Legation. We  found him.  He 
was dead, in the garden before the gate of th
e Legation.  The Nazis had killed him bec a use they 
had discovered that he was anti-Nazi.  When I re
turned they wanted to take attorney Fakash 
away from me.  They wanted him 
to leave the car and if he left 
the car, that was the end.  I was 
able to br ing him back to the Legation and I told
 him you'r e not to leave this Legation again.  I 
will go alone.  I will be escorted by the polic
e forces. I will go alone and you rema in here 
because your life is in danger.  So I...the days...
that's how the days passed after Christmas.  By 
New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the even
ing.  We  e ven danced...sure...we danced in the 
baseme nt of the Legation.  We  even brought out
 so me  bottles of Spanish wine.  There were 
hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious Span
ish wine from _______, bottles of ______ wine 
from these areas in Spain which is precious wine. 
 I liked it anyhow and I us
ed to drink it all the 
time in Spain.  And they danced.  They even danced.  I was ha ppy because these pe ople who 

were in hiding...and they were all Jews except for 
one who said he was a 
priest, but I don't think 
he was a priest.  I think that
 he was a priest who was pret
ending...uh a Jew who was pretending 
to be a priest I think, but I never saw him againthese are not details that
 really interested me  
since they did not come  into the offices.  They 
came  only for...in the last
 mo me nt wh en we were 
asleep in the baseme nt together a
nd that's when we had this party and that's when I saw them.  I I 
always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't ha
ve any contact with them.  You know, we'd just 
say hello and good evening and that's  it.  Th
ere was a Hungarian diplomat, ________, who had a 

wife and daughter...uh ma ny peopl e.  There was sixty 
or so people, and they even danced.  And 
then the situation began to get worse.  So we s
till continued to issue th
ose letters of protection 
because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not German
s, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I 
always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Mila
sh (ph)...so...what did I wa
nt to say...where was 
I...where was I...OK.  The first few days of Ja
nuary we heard som
e rumor s according to which it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
40 
 
seemed that they wanted to take
 away all of the Jews from the 
international ghetto and take them 
to the ol d grand ghetto and deport them.  I didn't
 believe in such a thing because they were 
saying that Minist er _____ who wa s in charge  of 
the civilians and military for the seized (ph) 
capital, they were saying that 
he was going to burn the ghetto a
nd ,and kill all the Jews.  This 
would have been the final Hungarian solution a
nd I didn't believe in such a thing.  In the 

meanti me  new letters we re being issued, not ve
ry ma ny but there was always some one who felt 
threatened because they had inspected the 
house next door or the apartment above...you know 

how it is.  So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or 
fifth or the sixth of January...I don't reme mber 
exactly...probably the fift h or the sixth of Janua
ry, I was crossing Mussolini Square to go to the 
orphanages which were very near
by and I saw a column of J e ws passing by and so I asked, who 
are these Jews?   And they say,these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews.  That night, during that 

during the night the Portuguese mi nister had sent an
 employee of his to ask me  orally to assume  
the responsibility for the Portugue
se Legation and I told him no, th
at if there is some thing, if 
there is some thing...if he can come  and explain to 
me , then we can come to an agreement, but as 
it stands I, I didn't...I couldn't assume  any more
 responsibilities.  I'd 
had enough of my own, and 
so I saw that they took away all those PortugueseJews and so I understood th
at that had already, 
ma n had already abandoned everything or he wa
s about to abandon everything because he was 
the Portuguese mi nister but he was a 
Hungarian citizen.  He was the ____________.  
__________ was his name , but he was a Hungarian 
citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese 
mi nister and therefore that ma n said he had ab
andoned everything, that he was stepping back and 
that he considered uh that he c
ouldn't do anything more.  So I wrot
e a letter to this mi nister and 
I...where I wr ote that I had heard 
these rumors, that I didn't believe
 in them, that please to deny 
these rumors but he didn't  respond and after 
two days I wrote him
....actually no...I telephoned 
and I said that I was about to come  to see hi
m...that I would come  see him the next day and I 

think that wa s January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of 
January.  Probably the 8th.  Perhaps even in the 
night.  Who knows.  Anyway, it's not that important. 
 So he went there that day.  I went  because I 
had heard these rumors which were more and mo
re prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the 
column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck andI went and I found in uh the chamber of the city 

hall Budapest, in the baseme nt, I found Wa llenbe
rg, the Swede, and _____ who was Swiss.  And 
I told them I'm going to go inside first because
 I have an appointment.  My appointment...it 
hadn't really been conferred to me  that I had an
 appointme nt but uh and when I return from the 
appointme nt then we can all talk together.  
The colonel uh who is h
ead of the gendarmerie, 
________ accompanied me  to the mi nister's offic e .  It was a little office in the baseme nt and this 

colonel three days later killed 
hims elf by the way.  He saw that 
everything was lost.  He'd been 
compromi sed because of the Jewish question and so 
he killed hims elf.  Sa
da (ph) was his name .  
Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole genda
rmerie of Hungary at that time , so I went to 
this mi nister that I had seen, not
 known, but I had seen him in thepast and very calml y he said 
yes.  He wanted to solve the Jewish question by 
killing everyone.  And so I started to say do you 
realize what's happening and do you realize what
's going to happen, that
 the Hungarian people 
will have to suffer because you killed a hundred
 thousand people, and so finally I even...you 
know...I even talked about the Myian (ph) civi
lization and everything th
at came to mi nd, ____ 
people...anything to move him.  I even cried. 
Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do 
anymore.  I I can't  just leave th
e situation like this, 
I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if 
within forty-five hours the Spanish governme nt doe
s not receive from m
e a 
guarantee that all is 
calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian governme nt have 

been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
41 
 
come  to an agreement with the Foreign Affair
s Minister and the Hungarian governme nt...we had 
reached an agreement and received guarantees
.  Not only that but the Hungarian government 
wanted to send a diplomatic representative 
to Madrid in order to, to tie diplomatic 
relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, i
n, in view of the peace tr
eaty, and logically the 
Spanish government who didn't wish to recogni
ze the Nazi governme nt, didn't want to hear 
anything about it.  The, the uh credentials, 
the request for credentials...he's explaining uh 
this...what credentials are...logically
 I didn't transmit these letters 
of...this request for credentials 
to Madrid.  It was for a certain Colone l _____.  I didn't transmit the m because if I did the 
Spanish government would probably say that that 
they that they didn't accept it because they 
didn't recognize the government 
while until then the governme nt, 
the Spanish governme nt kept 
quiet.  They kept quiet. 
 Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me  that he saw 
in the archives many telegrams from the H
ungarian government which asked the Spanish 
governme nt if I was really the charge d'affaires.  The Spanish governme nt never answered.  The 

Spanish ambassador told me  that last night. 
 They never...the Spanish governme nt never 
responded to these telegrams.  I understood natura
lly, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a 
preferential treatment with the 
Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have 
diplomatic relations with Spain 
to contact the Anglo-Americans. 
 We understood it late, but we 
understood it.  If we understood 
it imme diately, ma ybe two months
 earlier because we'r e already 
talking about the beginning of Nove mber...had we
 understood it earlier, two months ago, we 
would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but 

uh we'r e not...we weren't that intell
igent after all.  Th
e Spanish ambassador told me  not that...not 
everyone is intelligent.  I wasn't  intelligent.  
The other the other guy also wasn't  intelligent so uh 
what do you want.  So I told him that if within
 forty-five hours the Spanish governme nt doesn't  
get any guarantees that everythi ng is proceed
ing with order the three thousand Hungarian 
citizens which are, who are in, in
 Spain will be interned...actua
lly there were really a hundred 
including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish governme nt 
will...or ask the Brazilian governme nt and the Pa ra
guayan governme nt to do the same  with those 
Hungarian citizens who were in
 Brazil and Paraguay.  So th
is mi nister said a friendly 
governme nt like the Spanish governme nt would do su
ch a thing?   What friendly governme nt?   If 
you are against us, you're the ones who are against 
us.  This is what we want.  We  wa nt to 
protect these Jews.  You don't want to do it, so you are comi ng against our interests and against 

our policy and against our interests and our wish
es, so how can you say that we are friends.  
We 'r e friends if you say, if you do what we want.  
To sum it up he said, OK.  The Spaniards are, 

are excluded from the liquidation, will be exclude
d from the liquidation and so I said no, and I 
became uh demanding in that mo ment.  I said no.  
All...everyone or nobody.  All of those in the 
international ghetto must remain where they are or
 all those in the common ghetto must be, must 
have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what 

would what would happen of the Hungarian people, 
so I repeated to him ag
ain and all the stories 
about vendettas, terrible vende
ttas and uh the Anglo(c)Americans uh who would come to 
bombard the city and so forth 
and so on.  And so we agreed 
that everything would have uh 
occurred in that way.  When I left the office 
I found Wa llenberg and _____ we
re still there, and I 

explained the situation to them and I said I was ab
le to obtain this and that.  When you do inside 
I don't know what you can ask of this mi nister, 
but please don't uh do anything to undermine this 
agreement that we've just come to.  Otherw
ise nothing more...so Wa llenberg asked me  for 
political asylum in the Spanish Legation and 
I said fine, I'll wait for you.  You go to the 
Legation.  I'll wait for you and I'm going to ha
ve to go find some thing in the neighborhood and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
42 
 
then I'll, I'll meet you there at the Legation.  He sa
id no. I will come  with 
my car in the afternoon.  
I'll give you the car because I know you need a car,
 and I'll come .  I never saw him a gain.  Never 
saw him aga i n.  I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he was on ____ Street.  I 
know this for sure, and he had left the house at
 ten in the morning to go I don't know where.  
From then on he disappeared.  Now since the si
nce historians say that 
on the 16th he went to 
______ at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there.  I say that's  not true 

because on the morning of the 18th he  was in B
udapest in the on the ____ Street.  _____ me ans 
king.  I don't know really...I saw him ma ybe a doz en
 times.  I spoke to him specifically during 
the meetings with diplomats.  I never saw him ot
herwise.  From the beginning of December, all 
the diplomats, mutual diplomats, had disappeared
.  He couldn't find any of them.  Wa ll enberg... 
when I saw Wallenberg at city hall in Budape
st on the meeting, the day that I me t _____, uh I'd 
seen him, besides that time, I 'd seen him on 
December 22nd at the uh Papa l Nuncio (ph) where 
he had signed a document uh to protest uh and this
 was in favor of women and I remember that 
he did not sign that document because he couldn't 
sign it because he was a secretary and Minist er 
Danielson, his boss, was there.  Th
e ambassador.  His, his boss wasn't  
there at that time .  Uh that 
morning during the meeting I told the Archbish
op Angelo _____ I would like to speak privately 
with you and so we went into another office and 
so I told him look...I started speaking to him in 
Italian.  In the meetings we always spoke in Frenc
h.  Uh I started speaking 
in Italian.  I said look, 
I'm not a Spaniard.  I'm Italian a
nd I'm close to you because I'm, I was born in Komo (ph) and he 

had also been born close to Komo.  He said oh, 
you're...you're kidding.  You're joking.  I said no, 
no.  I'm not kidding.  This is the truth.  I tell you 
this because if some thing would ever happen to 
me , you...I want you to know this so that you can uh 
tell my relatives.  He told me, I reme mber, 
don't tell ______.  _____ was his secretary because 
that guy is very picky.  He can...he mi ght 
become  very angry, mi ght cause trouble. 
 I said no, no.   I won't tell ______.  And 
his...practically this is where 
the story ends because after 
a fe w days...no, actually the next 
morning, Mr. ____, Mr. ____ sent an employee to as
k for telegrams to send to Madrid because 
we didn't have a radio.  The capital was under si
ege and it wasn't ...we couldn't communicate with 

Vienna.  Normally you could telephone Vienna, Vi
enna telephoned Berlin, and Berlin via radio 
communicated to Madrid.  But this...it was no lo
nger possible to  use the phone.  And so I sent 
this employee to ask for a telegram which uh I asked him to send via radio radio because he had 

a radio.  Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who 
was an attorney who was very picky, an old-
timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the tele
gram and I told him look, if I don't send the 
telegr am as soon as this employee goes back to Mi
nist er _____, everythi ng will fall apart.  If we 

send the telegram we'll save four or five days.  
We'll gain four or five days because the Spanish 
government will of course have to reflect on th
is before responding.  They'r e not going to 
respond immediately obviously.  The telegram will 
be se nd today.  I don't  know if it'l l  arrive 

immediately in Madrid and who will receive it in Madr
id.  It ha s to be sent to Bern and this takes 
time.  I wrote to Bern.  I wrote to the embassy
 in Bern.  After two or three or four days 

the...Madrid sent its response than
king uh thanks and it said that 
it was sure that the Hungarian 
governme nt would have respected the agreementsand so forth and so on.  The employee came to 

deliver the telegram hi mself and he said that th
e mi nister was very sati
sfied with the telegram 
and so forth. And then one time something happen
ed which is a little bit funny but at the same  
time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it gave 
me , made me a little bit 
anxious.  I went to the 
Foreign Affairs Mi nist ry.  This was at the end of
 December.  I think before Christmas I went to 
the Foreign Affairs Ministry a
nd I entered the antech
amber where the secre...permanent secretary 
had his office.  He was like a Vice Minister 
with whom I 'd had contact.  His name  was  _____, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
43 
 
and I saw that there were two me n s eated on a 
couch who were waiting and one of them I, I 
recognized.  He was the Chancello
r of the Italian Legation, the R
oyal Italian Legation, and the 
other gentlema n I didn't  know who he was, so I 
very boldly...I had to very boldly salute them 
like this and instead of going to the 
secretary who sort of looked at 
me  with surprise, I went to to 
the door.  I pretended to knock.  I went inside and 
to see this Vice Minister
.  I did what I had to 
do and after four...after fifteen mi nutes or so I 
left.  I said goodbye to the young lady and I ma de 
a, a vague signal with my hand like this and I left.   But once I arrived in the in the hallway I 
really came back and I started to eaves...eavesdrop
 and I heard that these two people entered the 
office and entered the Vi ce Minister's office so
 I entered the area too, and I asked Mrs...the 
young lady...and I said, oh I think I r
ecognize these two me n and she said the big ma n is Minister 
Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republ
ic of Italy and the other is his 
secretary.  He was the he was a 
fascist mi nister, the Social Republ
ic...the Fascist Social Repub
lic.  On the 16th...in the meantime 
between the...on the 13th it wasn't  possible to leave the Legation anymore.  We  still had 

telephone communications 
with which I could control or 
check on the various houses, not 
directly because there we re no phones in the hou
ses but there were Christians who lived uh in 
front of the houses or next to them, t he houses, a
nd they had agreed to te
lephone to us if there 
was danger and for example with Eva Long (ph) on 
the evening of January 3rd or 4th or 5th or 
whatever it was. I think she told me  even...I
 think she even told me ...anyway they, they 
reme mber more than I do.  She called me  and 
I went over there at th
ree in the morning.  
Anyhow– There wasn't ...no...it wasn't  just that time
.  That happened ma ny times, ten or fifteen 
times.  Al most every evening I had to get up and 
go because the Nazis wanted to come and take 

them away, to take the Jews away from the 
houses. ...speaking.  I told them that we had 
agreements with the 

Hungarian governme nt and so forth and so 
on and in the meantime somebody well from my 

entourage...I always had an ent
ourage. I always had four polic
e officers and two employees of 
the security office and in reality I always trav
eled with two people but
...two policemen and two 
public security people, and they 
never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two 
policemen who left and the Legation too...I...I fe
lt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag 

and the banner whenever I traveled with them. 
 But anyway this norma lly happened at night and 
I would go on foot because it was dangerous to 
go by car at ni ght.  There weren't very ma ny 
lights.  But anyhow that night, th
at last night that 
I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's 
house...I didn't  know Eva Long at the time.  I me t 
her only three years ago.  I...I arrived five 
mi nutes after a ma n had thrown hims elf out ofthe window from the fifth floor and you asked me  

how I, how could I prevent them from taking th
em away and I would tell them that we had 
agreements and then at the same  time one of 
my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone 
the police commando and the Colonel ______ would inte
rvene.  This is so
me one who had helped 
me , because I had contacts with 
everyone, with Nazis, non-Nazis.  
It doesn't matter that he was a 
Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so
 I had contacts with him and there was a 
Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a 
beard.  If I asked him for something, he would do it for me.  
You understand.  Now I had contacts with him. 
 I had contacts with everyone.  Whoever 
happened to be there, I ha d cont
acts with because that's how 
you had to operate.  Experience 

taught me  that everyone can be useful.   Th
ere's some who do big 
favors and some  who do 
smaller favors.  Some  could intervene for this 
and some  could intervene for that reason.  The 
Foreign Affairs Minister could intervene for that
 and the Interior Minist
er could intervene for 
this and the Nazi Party for anot
her reason and so the 
last three days I couldn't leave because on 
the street where the Legation was
...at the very end of the street
...the street was three hundred 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178

me ters long, there was a Russian tank with th
e mouth of the cannon facing the street which 
would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dare
d to leave and go on the street.  In order to 
cross the street from the Legation to the 
____ Paraguayan Legation which was...you had to open 
the door and dash, ma ke a dash to get to the ot
her side.  And as soon as
 you did the, the tank 
would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was 
in telephone contact with the houses because as 
I said there were always Chri
stian friends who had telephones in nearing the houses who were 
called.  They saw some t hing abnorma l.  For example, that night they called...I don't know who 
they called.  After half an hour I arrived and I sa
w that they were about to take them a way.  I 

stopped everything but unfortunately
 I arrived five mi nutes after 
a ma n threw hims elf out of a 
window on the fifth floor.  I thought
 it was a woman, but Eva Long 
told me that it was a ma n.  

When I arrived they had already covered th
e body.  The police had covered the body.  And I 
thought it was a woma n but in...it was a ma n.  An
d so on the 16th uh you arrived in my  area, on 

my street and until the afternoon, in the afte
rnoon, up until the afternoon they had respected 
extra-territory _____.  We took the flag down.  
We put the Swedish flag up.  We  took the 
emble m, the  Spanish emblem down and put the 
Swedish emblem because Sweden was supposed 
to protect Spain's interests.  No...because that's
 the way it's done.  When one nation cannot have 
relations with another nation, another nation which 
can have relations, it can intervene to protect 
the interests and in fact 
I think that Sweden was able to...after 
ten or twelve days of the Russian's  
arrival, to...was able to empty the building, the 
Spanish building.  Of that I'm not really sure 
because I was in hidi ng.  I couldn't do anything 
more.  As I was telling you about Wa llenberg, on 
the morning of the 18th, the Russians took me  an
d they put me to sw
eep the streets. ______ 
Street...I had to sweep _____ Street
.  At a certain point I saw in 
front of a building a man whose 
name  was _____ who,  who had been my chauffeu
r and who had been wounded driving my car.  
I wasn't  there at the time.  Uh my...in my pos
ition where I was seated uh there was a policeman 
who was killed.  He...and then the car was take
n away and then the car was found again a few 
hours later but it was destroyed.  This ma n has b
een my chauffeur to do me a favor and at the 
same  ti me  had, he had also, he had had ties with 
the International Red Cross because the delegate 
of the International Red Cross ne
ver showed his face.  The huma n mi series.  So I asked him, did 
you see Wa llenberg.   He  said yes.  He's here.  Please, go, go fetch him.  I can't move  because 

there's this guy here with a machine gun, the 
GBU guy who, who is forcing me  to sweep the 
street.  After fifteen mi nutes or
 ten mi nutes though he came  back.  
He say no, he's  gone.  He left 
a few mi nutes ago, and this is about eleven in
 the morning, but from 
then on nothing more was 
heard about Wallenberg, so I, therefore I think that
 he died or because he was hit by a sniper or  
because he was hit by a German grenade.  Uh they
 resisted until the mi d(c)February in the castle 
of Buda (ph), in the h
ills of Buda, I think, or perhaps he
 me t a group of Nazis, Hungarians, 
Nazis, who recognized him and 
who killed him on the spot. 
 There were hundreds and hundreds 
of bodies buried in the snow in 
the area of the Spanish Legation, Mu
ssolini Square.  I think that 
he wanted to cross _____ Street to go to 
the international ghett
o, I think.  Or  anyhow 
such...this...a similar declaration was...I ma de a si
milar declaration in 1962 
I think after a request 
that was ma de to me  by the Swedish Consulate in
 Milan.  Last year Danielson's widow invited 
me  to her house in the province of Trento (ph). 
 I was at ______ and when we talked about this 
issue, she told me  that her husband and the Fo
reign Affairs Minister 
ne ve r  be li e v e d  tha t  
Wallenberg was taken to the Soviet Union, Russi
a.  Anyhow, some  people were interested in 
blowing up the issue in good faith but
 then others kept saying things 
that were not true.  As far as 
I was concerned that's what happened.  I ma y be 
wrong but that's how it was for m
e .  That's what 
I believe.  I rema ined three or four months until
 April, May...five months  in Budapest and then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0178  
45 
 
the Russians uh kicked every...all the foreign citizen
s out.  I wa s trying to get back home  but they 
could have sent us Italians home with the trains
 and in ten or twelve hours we would have been 
to Capezio (ph) or to or  to the other pl ace, 
what's it called..._______.  Instead they sent  us via 
Bucha_____, Istanbul and it took ten da
ys of travel in latched up 
cars and with a hunger that I 
don't want to speak about because we didn't even
 have any money.  There was nothing left.  I 
didn't have anything.  I had onl
y... everything...I had only what I 
was wearing the day that the 
Russians arrived.  Everything had been burnt at  the Legation. No...yes...at the villa of the 
Spanish Legation in Budapest, at Buda, and everyt
hing else was stolen by the Russians.  I didn't 
even have a shaver to shave.  In those days 
they had...I had a Gillette shaver.  Uh we...when we 
arrived...when I arrived in Istanbul, I found the
...someone who had the suitcase that once...a 

suitcase that once had belonged to 
me  and which had also my shavi
ng kit and I said to him I need 
my shaving kit.  Luckily this person had an extra shaving kit.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

–When I returned to Italy I f
ound that my comp any had fired me
 and, and it was an ugly period 
and I had to even pay for the car that I had borro
wed from an Italian and 
the car was then burnt 
and I had to pay for that car with my mone
y, but anyway it was a bad period, but anyway I 
ma naged.  It's difficult when you're forty to change 
jobs and in a bad situati
on as it was in Italy at 
the time , the Wa r of the Mosques (ph) and so fort
h.  It's  hard to adapt and I once again went to 

start afresh and to find work.  I, I adapted.  Uh
 I had to...in order to put bread on the table, and 
some ti me s I wasn't  able to do that perfectly but
 after ten years I was successful.  My son was 
born and we'll ____ for all the sacrifices.  I was ab
le to raise him and to
 settle, settle him and 
now I consider that I'm uh I'm all settled.  I can't 
say that I am uh I'm rich, but I live, live.  I live 
and I'm happy this way.  Especially because a
ll of those people who had been helped by me  uh 
looked for me  and they celebrated me .  They made me  come to Wa shington.  You'r e  welcomed.  

If in the future, if you need any explanations
 on anything, we can corr
espond, but you must write 
in Italian.  _________________.  I don't know what happened.  There's a lady here, Magadelena 

(ph), who knew him we ll.  She asked me  the same  
thing.  What happened?   And I say at the end 
of Nove mbe r , I believe, before Sanspritz left, he
 disappeared.  Since he 
was trying to get to home 
in Spain, perhaps he was able with
 the passport that he 
had, perhaps he was able to go to Spain.  
It was difficult because he was a 
deserter of the Blue Division 
of Spain which was fighting with 
the Germans.  He had fought in these Divisions ne
xt to, with the Germans.   I don't...I can't ...I've 
tried to find out because he was a very nice 
guy.  He was young.  He was probably twenty-two, 
ma ybe twenty-three.  He was a very nice guy.  He
 was very helpful.  He, he gave me  a hand 
in...several time s for some thing.  I reme mber that
 he came with, he accompanied me.  But at the 
end of Nove mber he disappeared and that day we
 didn't see him again.  Yes–Italian.  There are 
some  people who helped me  morally, who lives
 in Germany now and mo rally...gave me  moral 
support.  And then there was Attorney Fakash w
ho unfortunately died the day that the Russians 
entered the city.  That was so unlucky for him.
  He had a beautiful da
ughter who was ten years 
old.  He was ma rried.  He  was Jewish, but I th
ink that he converted 
because he ma rried a 
princess, __________ from Vienna.  Not a royal princes
s.  She had the title of a princess but it 
wasn't  a royal title.  I don't know exa c tly 
what...Mrs.__________.  No, why. 
 I told you that she 
helped me  morally.  Thanks to you.  If in the futu
re you need some  explanations, I'd love to send, 
I'd love to send.  You can correspond with me  in It
aly, but please write in 
Italian so that I don't 
need to have it translated and so forth.  Let me
 guess.  There were, th
ere are ma ny other things 
that I could tell.  I keep sayi
ng that the day...I keep saying that the work did not involve just 
writing those letters of protecti
on.  Once those letters were writt
en, the work to protect these 
people just got started because they had to be 
protected day and night.  
Wh en I slept...Italian...
