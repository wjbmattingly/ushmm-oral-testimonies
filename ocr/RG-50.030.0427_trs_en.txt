____.  And i n 1922
, January 31, 1922. 
Q: And tell me  somethin
g about you're parents, 
starting with you're father
?  Where was he from?  
A: My father lived in 
M osc ow a nd he was a ta nner.  I s upp
os e he  was  a c he mist  knowing about  
tanni ng s kins and t he whol
e fa mily really was involved in th
e ta nnery business .  And hi s t hree  
brot hers  a nd hi msel f, t he y  all li ve d i n Mosc ow.  
N ow  my  fat he r  marrie d my  mot her als o in M osc o w  
and she wa s st udying at the  
Russian, at t he Mosc ow Pi an
o Conservatory, 
I mean Musi c  
Conse r vat or y, she was st udying pi an
o.  And she wa s st udie d then, hist
ory.  No w as far as I know, 
after the Russian revolution in 19
19, t hey move d t o Pol and t o Gr
odno whe re the brot he rs a nd the re  
wer e thre e si sters , the y al l ope ned a t a nner y and it wa
s a large tannery a nd t hey 
all worked in there. 
My father was primarily involved
 in actual tanning of the skin
s and one of th
e br other s  wa s  
pri maril y i n vol ved in tr aveli ng and ma king t he  bus
i ness contacts.  And t he sister s were married. 
Now one of my father 's sisters's 
wa s  marr ied t o an Aria n Ge r ma n 
and they lived in Klinicksbe rg 
(ph)  but t he  t wo ot her  si st ers wer e ma r r ied t o
 Rus si an Je ws  and they
 all lived in Grodno. 
Q: Could we backtrack just
 a little bit and I'm intere
sted in hearing whether 
you're fa ther's fa mily 
wer e ta nners  ba ck for  ge nera
tions  and whether t his  wa s a  
tradition in you're fa mily? 
A: I think this was a tradition as 
far as I know.  And t here was al wa
ys talk about sk
ins and hi des .  
No w wh at el se?  

Q: Now they came , do you know
 why they decided to come?  
A: Bec aus e t hey didn't want to be under the Russi
a ns in Russia ,  you know, i n the Bol she viks .  They 
were intelligencia.  They were cult
ur ed, t hey wer e well educated and 
they just were fr ee thinkers.  
The y didn't wa nt t o be  in the  
re vol uti on.  They we ren't  Commu n
ists .  The y wer e proprie tors.

Q: And so they all came together? 
A: They al l, well  one by one.  I 
don't think that they just came
 by covered wagon, you know, all  
together.  But all I know is that 
t hey al l moved be f ore I  was  born.  
And t her e were fo
ur girls of my 
fat her 's  ol des t  sist er.  And the  gr andmother  was  t h
ere too.  Grandfather wa
s  de ad alre ady, I belie ve . 
Q: And you're mother's
 fa mil y bac kgr ound?  
A: N o w  my  mothe r 's  fa mil y, I be
lieve they lived 
in Ri ga for some t i me  but
 t he y als o moved to 
Gr odno be ca use I re me mber my mot h er 's ste p- mot her 
and my mother 's fat h er. 
 My mot her 's fathe r  
died just about, I was about three-
year s-old.  Bec a use  I have a  pictur
e of my mother 
in a bl ack veil  
and that  was traditi onal, to wear 
for mour ning for one ye
ar.  You wore a  blac k veil a nd t his i s a  
pictur e a ft er my gr andfat her, her  
fat h er, died a natural 
deat h.  And t hen the grandmother, t he step-
grandmother, you know, liv
ed with us.  An d I don'
t know when she di ed.  I t hi nk it  wa s quite a  
while after we moved away from 
Grodno.  And then my
 mot her had a sister
 who was married and 
they lived i n a smal
l town in Northe rn Poland called Sue- vo
w- key ( ph) and t hey ha d t w o childr en, a  
daughter and a son.  And 
when t he war began, you see t hey were
 i n Northern Poland and as far as 
we know, when the Ger ma ns inva de d they peris h ed.  
We just lost contact with
 them completely.  So 
I don't know what happened to th
e m.   My mother 's br other, the onl y brot her, sta ye d in Rus sia a nd  
aft er t he war  i mmi grat ed to Isr ael.  And he had t wo 
children and they still liv
e i n Isr a el.  I visit ed  
them t her e. 

Q: Was you're mother's  fami
l y intell i gencia as well? 
A: Oh yes .  Her brot her and t he c ous in, a ctuall y i t
 wa s the c o usin, not her  brot her, t he y were both 
denti sts .  That 's why my mot her 
s t udied de ntist ry too.  So t he y we
re all very well to do and ver y,  
very universi ty graduat es and s o-call e d i ntelli genci a. 

Q: Where di d you're mot her
 and you'r e fat her  meet ?

A: Where what? 
Q: Where di d your mother
 and your father meet?  

A: I suppose  they met i n Mosc ow a s
 far as I know.  You k
now?  It was a di ffer ent 
ki nd of li fe at t hat  
ti me .  The c hildre n j ust didn't parti ci pate ver y much 
in t he pa rents ' doi ngs , s o I don't r eally, I ' m not  
sure how the y me t and whate ver ha ppene d.  I just
 kno w t hat when we liv ed  in Kra ko w , wh en I was  

already about four or five-year s ol
d, we wer e  ver y well t o do.  We
 went on vacati on for two mont hs 
to a resort  li ke Klen-neet -sa (p
h) wa s one of t he re sorts or _
__________ a n d so meti me s  Marie nba d 
and Ger ma n y a nd a nywa y, we li ve d li ke t he  ric h peopl e li ved. 

Q: Di d you have  br othe rs or si ster s?  

A: Ye s.  I had, one sist e r  die d be
fore I was born and I 
guess  she had convulsi on
s as far as I knew. 
The n about a ye ar lat er, or t wo 
years  later , I was bor n. 
 And t hen I had a brot her a ye ar-and-a- hal f  
younger.  And when 
I was sixteen years old my
 mother had anot
her child, a little girl, Felicia.  I 
have pictures of her too. 
Q: Your oldest sister's  name?  
A: Was Mil a . 

Q: And you're youn
ger br other 's  na me ? 
A: My younger brot her 's  na me  wa
s Sher ma n a nd we calle d hi m Ce nia  
(ph), was Russian.   But then 
later on, when we lived
 in Krakow, he wa s 
called Sherma ke (ph). 
Q: And you're fa mily, wa s th
e house h old ver y reli gious?  
A: No.  We  were, it was the free
 t h inker s of Russia .  The y  we
re Je wish and they considered 
the mse lve s J ewi sh, but we had a 
Pa ss over Supper and I know my fa
ther went to the Synagogue fo r 
the High Hol i days.  And I  
think, I don't know whethe
r it was al s o for Pass over too or not , but we di d 
have a Pas s over s upper  at home.  And that wa
s about , but they di d go to the Synagogue on

Sat urda ys .  But  we di d go, my 
brot her and I we nt to wha t  wa s 
calle d the Sunda y s chool wher e we 
wer e taught mai nly t he histor y of t he  Jewish pe op
le.  That 's what
 the Sunda y sc hool consiste d of. 
The re was no pra ying but just le arni ng the hist ory 
of the  reli gi on a nd hist ory of t he J e wis h people. 
And then my  brot her went to a Hi
gh School, t o a Hebre w s chool.  
Be cause t hey ope ne d a very good 
privat e s chool and I we nt to a 
pri v ate High Sc hool, wit h non-J e
wish, this Polish
 private Hi gh  
School.  And my  brother we nt
 t o a He bre w Hi gh School. 

Q: This  was  aft er you ha d moved to?  

A: To Krakow. 

Q: So you're  fa mil y ca me fr om Russ i a and were 
li ving in Pola nd.  What la nguage did t hey s pea k at  
home?  

A: At home ?  They spoke Russian.  And I spoke 
Russian until the age of four or fo ur and a half 
when we mo ved t o Kra k ow
.  And then they hire d a nanny, a 
Ger ma n nanny.  Not J e wish, Ger ma n. 
And she  ta ught me  Ger ma n
.   An d t hen  I we nt t o 
sc hool , it wa s a  public  school, whe re I l earne d  
Poli sh.  So I wa s re a
lly trilingual by the 
time  I was about seven. 
Q: Do you have  any me mories  of 
Gr odno in you're very earl y  li fe?  
A: Yes.  I have a little 
bit.  Now I don't 
rememb er the we
dding but I remember th
at we had a very 
nice apart me nt and, but I really don'
t r e me mbe r  to o muc h.  
My earliest recollection is that we use to 
go to t he be ach a nd I thi nk it was t h e beac h on t h
e river Nemen (ph) and 
I re me mb e r  my mo th er 
dunki ng hers elf i n the wa ter and my brothe r was j u
st cra wli ng around a nd I  
found a bunch of key s  
in t he sand.  That 's all  I r e member . 

Q: Were  you parti cul arly close  with 
ei ther your  mother or  your  fat her?  
A: Oh yes .  Yo u see , we  were reall y,  well we  we
re br ought  up li ke ri ch c hildre n are brought  up.  
You know?   We  had e ver ythi ng we ne ede d, nic e 
cl othe s, and we just li
ve d a  ver y ha ppy l i fe .

Q: Wh at kind of activit
y did you do for fun? 
A: You mean when I was little?  
Q: Yes .  

A: Act ually I don 't re me mb er what wa s Gr od no
, but when we c a me to
 Kra kow, I had dancin g  
class es.  I  ha d piano l ess ons .  It was always  a  joke
 that after the third teac
her my mot h er decided it  
wasn't t he t e acher 's 
fa ult, so I ga ve up t he pia no lessons  
a nd I als o gave up the  si ngi ng less ons. 
Those  were  two things I  coul d not  
do.  But I  c onti nue d wit h my danc
ing a n d ac ting.  I l iked to do 
that ver y much.  And I  eve n wr
ote a couple of plays that were
 per f or me d i n my  sc hool, my  
ele ment ary s chool.  And t hen I start ed serious st udi
es in Hi gh School.  It wa
s a private High School . 
And I was going to be a doct or.  So
, never ha ppe ned, but that  were t h
e pla ns.  I n spi t e of my lovi ng 
to dance and, you know
, I was  per f or mi ng thr o
ugh t he da ncing s chool . 
Q: So t hes e wer en't your plans,
 to be c o me a doct or ?   Wher e t h
ey your parents 
pl ans for you?  
A: Oh ye s.  My pare nts.  Eve n t h
ough they didn't think th
at a girl should be a 
doctor, they agreed to 
that.  And t hey supporte d me very
 strongly in that.  I almost ga
ve up da ncing by the n, but t hey , 
whi ch ma de the m ver y ha ppy beca use  they were , t h ey
 really didn't think that 
I shoul d be  a  ball erina. 
Q: Why didn't you bec o me a  doctor?  

A: Bec a u se t he war st arte d.  An d I wa s in my sec o
nd year of ______
_____, whi ch wa s e qui vale nt to  
the J uni or College here a nd t he s chools were clos e d  in Decemb er and there 
wa s als o t he ti me  wher e  
the Uni ver si ties were cl osed and 
t h e Pr ofessor s  wer e in Kr akow, 
they were sent to Auschwitz. 
That 's  the fir st ti me  we found out  
about t he Auschwi tz, at t hat ti me
 it was just a 
prison-like camp,  
and so anyway at that point I ga
ve up my studies until 
I got back to the Unite
d States and in 194 8  
and 1949, 1949 I gra duat ed from the Uni ver sity of Mi
c higan a nd the n for one year I we nt to, well i t

wa s actually a year and a hal f, t o gra d uate sc hool fo
r medical technology.  I ma
rried a doctor.  That's 
as cl os e a s I  got  to medici ne. 
Q: I'd like to go back a little bit and hear howit was that your family 
moved from Grodno to 
Krakow? 

A: We ll I really don't know the busi
ness part of it but I think that 
there were more 
opportunities.  I  
think that the fa mily was grow
ing and that  mi ght have bee n
 s o me kind of, ma ybe even 
disa gree me nts, you know, as far a s how t he busi ne
ss s hould be  run and I kn
ow that my  father had 
the opportunity to purchase this 
ta nne r y set- up in Kra kow.  And th
at 's when we move d.  And t he n 
his ol dest br other deci de d to move too.  The y di
dn't ha ve a ny chi l dre n, he wa s ma rried, but no  
childr en.  And he deci de d to move als o, bu
t a  fe w mont hs a fter  we  move d t o  Krakow. 
Q: Wh at yea r  was  
it t hat  you move d?  
A: No w t hat wa s 19 26 .  I thin k it 
was summer of '26.  B
ecause I  remember there 
wa s some kind of a 
busi ness i n fl ation and t here was so
mething wrong with th
e Poli sh __________ a t
 that time because 
our re nt, we rente d an apart ment , 
the whole flat , a nd I know that the rent had to be pai d in doll ars . 
The  dollar  was good even the n. 

Q: Di d you l i ve wit h your fat her 's brothers  a n
d sist ers or did the y li
ve elsewhere i n Kra kow? 
A: No , in Krako w?   No .  My br
other, I mean my father's brot
her and his wi fe ha d a separat e  
apart ment .  Right ar ound the cor ner
 fr om us.  But much 
smal ler than ours beca
use the y just  di dn't  
have a big family but we had a la
rge apartment.  It's still, we vi
sited the people that own it just a  
year  ago and the y r e mode led it . 

Q: Do you have a ny, I was inte rest
e d in he aring whether you have me
mo ries of your 
father's family 
since t he y a l wa ys s ee me d to be around duri ng y
our c hildhood?   Were you 
particularly close to  
them?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

A: Well I know that they all work
ed t oget her because I know t her
e wer e long di sta nce phone c alls  
so I think that my father's tanne
ry was sort of a, still connected 
somehow to the No
rthern part of 
Poland fa mily.  So I know that they were all workin
g toget he r .  And my father
's sister , that 's t he one 
wit h the, that eventuall y ended up
 in Ne w Yo rk , he was mai n ly in th
e busi ness part of t his skin a nd  
hide  busi nes s a nd the y li ved in War s aw.  And act ua
lly they de cide d t o mo ve, 
at first  they moved t o  
England and then t o t he Uni ted St
ates.  They decided to move.  
My cousin was about thre e years 
older t ha n I a m and he went to t he Univer sity j u
st  befor e the war and was 
beat up by t he universit y  
students who were very, very an
ti-Semitic.  There wa
s a quota and Jewish st
udents and so there was 
everything, things were 
very hopeless.  And that
's where my Uncle decide
d that they 
will move. 
And that was still in 193
8.  And they m
oved to England and th
en they moved to 
the United States. 
That 's  how t hey were  a bl e to ta ke 
all of their posse
ssions with them. 
Q: And in Krakow were there 
pe opl e who you wer e partic ularl y
 cl ose  with in your fa mil y?  
A: Yes.  Our family was just the Uncl e, that 's this one over here. 
Q: Wh at wa s  his  n a me?  
A: M a rella .  And hi s wi fe 's na me 
was Ida or Eda.  And we wer e 
ver y cl ose but t hey didn't have  
children so they were treating us 
like their children, so this was ver
y, very nice .  And e s peciall y my, 
the Aunt loved to read to us when we were small.  And so we were quite close.  Then my father's 

youngest  br other , Da vi d, a nd his  wi
fe Nina , here  on the pi cture, an
d they wer e di vorc ed.  And he  
remarried and they were deported by 
the Russi ans to Siberi a.  And atthat, the first ye
ar  of war, my 
Un cle was i n New Yor k pro c ur er
 of Hondur as  pass port s for ev
e r ybody.  And my cous in was  
fourt een.  And he live d wit h some
 Uncle or some body i n 
Vil na at that  ti me 
and he  just took t h e 
pass ports a n d went t o Russia.  He
 traveled t hrough the entire Russia 
all the way to Siber ia where he 
found his fat her wit h the wi fe 
a nd t h e ste psist er.  And t he y al
l ha d typhus .  No

recovered but my Uncle died
.  And St eve didn™t want t o sta y t h er
e of course, by th
en he wa s fi ft e e n 
or so, but hi s stepmo
ther was afraid to leave.
  And he gave the m the 
pa ssports a nd left.  They 
survi ve d and, but he went  via Te hra n to Israel .  And so he spe nt  the rest of t h e war i n Isra el and t hen 
now he lives in Paris.  He is married and has a son.  So that's another part of the family that 

survi ve d. 

Q: Di d any of your  mot he r 's fa mil y . . .? 

A: As far as my mo th er 's fa mi ly
, the only one that I know is my 
cousin who is ma rrie d and has t wo  
childr en and they live i n I srael .  I  
mean, after the war, th
ey spent the war in Russia and they we nt to 
Israel .  But  my mother 's  sister
 and he r husband a n d t wo c hildr e n, 
who lived in Po
land, perished. 
Q: Were they in Poland near
 you wh en you we re there? 
A: No, the y  we re, ye s, not duri ng 
t he war .  I  mean, they
 were in Poland, in 
the northern part o f 
Pol and, i n Sue-bow-key (ph) , which 
wa s cl oser  to Gr odno.  Al so t he 
youngest brother of my  father, 
his wi fe, t ha t 's the one fr om t he wedding, and th
ey ha d one daught er.  They were i n Gr odno an d 
they peris he d.  There we re a whol e bunc h of c ousin
s of my father's that I 
didn't real ly know very  
well and I don't think th
at any of them survived
.  At  least  t he ones 
that we re in Poland. 
Q: As a child did you 
pla y wit h your brot her  a l ot or did you have  ot her pla y mates?  
A: Well a ctually, a s long as we ha d the nanny, whi c
h was fr om about the age of
 ten or so, we pla yed  
toget her  and we  were  sort  of livi n
g in a secluded ki nd of 
an environment.  We  
wer e s up ervis ed ver y  
much and we were not allowed to 
just roam around on the streets 
and all the activities were ver y  
much super v ised.  But  th
en I had a fr iend who's mother  was pa
rtiall y par alyze d a nd her na me  was  
Irene Gottlieb (ph) and they
 lived very close to us
 so my mother sort of
 took over and the girl 
always  went  on di ffer ent  exc ursi ons  wit h us and 
she wa s the onl y child a nd 
her father was in som e  
kind of a busines s, movi e hous e or
 something like that, and so he di
dn't have ver y mu ch ti me .  And

the mother  c oul dn't get a r ound ver y
 much so Irene was my best frie
nd.  I r ene sur vive d the  war but 
died young because she had a h
eart condition.  And she 
married a Poli
sh, and also 
when the war 
started her mother  was dead alr ea
dy.  And the  fa ther bought Poli sh
 pa per s for  hi ms el f and t he gir l  
and her name became Irena 
Ravitch instead of Irena 
Gottlieb and so she 
was sort of in Polish side in 
hidi ng.  She mar r ied a Polish man, 
the y had a Cat h olic wedding.  He di dn't know s he was Je wis h. 
And t hey ha d one daughter, who unti l
 last year  di d not know anyt hi
ng a b out it .  But my daughte r  
met her.  They corresponded fo
r year s and my da ughter met her 
and Vanda wa nte d to know more  
about her mother  and she su
spected that there were some other th
ings that she didn'
t know about but  
my daught er  kne w all  a b out  it a nd 
she tol d Vanda.  Beca
use  la st year, I sa y, " Why di d you tell her? " 
and s he didn't know a nyt hing and 
my daughte r  sa ys, " Well , now 
she knows ."  And s he was very 
grateful.  And now she kn
ows where she come s fr om.

A: Yes .  We ll we h a d se veral n a n nie s.  Th ere wer e
 di ffere nt ones .  I think _________ l asted a bout a  
couple of years or so.  But also
 there were different 
stages.  Wh en we were little, we had a nanny 
that pri ma r il y taught us t he langua ge and ni ce be havi
or a nd all  that and the n when we wer e olde r, i t

wal king me  to school.  It was not very far to 
walk bec ause when we vi sited Kra kow and too k  
pictures it was just 
about a five-minute walk, but s
till, I was walked
 to school. 
Q: You we nt  to a sec ular  school?  
A: No.  I t was a  publi c s chool 
and a n  ele me ntar y school  and whi l
e I  was  there , us uall y t he sys t e m  
wa s that you we nt to school for f
our  years  and t h en you c oul d go to
 Hi gh School.  
Ho we ver , wh en  I 
was in my f ourt h grade, instea
d of movi ng ont o High Sc hool , they
 changed t he syst
em.  More like 
the Ameri ca n, t hat you we nt to 
school thr ough si xth grade and the n
 you we nt to Hi gh Sc hool for  
four ye ars.  Be fore t hat  t he Hi gh 
Sc hool was six years .  And s o I st
ayed on bec aus e I wante d to sta y  
wit h all my friends and I went to elementar y school
 through s i xth gra de and th
en I we nt to a privat e  
High School  for four yea r
s.  And t he n to publi c 
___________, whi c
h was as I said ver y equival ent  
to Juni or Col l ege for t wo years.  
It wa s suppose to be fo
r two years, however, 
it was only a year and 
a little bit less than a year and 
a half because in December the 
schools were closed.  And the  
teachers tried to teach us privat el
y but then t he law was writt en that
 it was forbi dden even t o have  
any ki nd of education so the sc
hools were closed and t he t eache
rs would not  teach because t hey 
would have gone to jail .  So we we re  just wai ti
ng.  My educat ion was int e rrupt ed for quite a few 
years until I got back to th
e University of Michiga
n.  Well, actually I went
 to a High Sc
hool in Ne w 
York after t h e war and they mai nly
 ta ught, j ust l ea rned Engli sh an
d the American Hist or y because I  
nee ded t hat for my citiz e nshi p.  And i n Hi gh Schoo
l I studied Englis h 10, 11 
and 12 and in Engli sh 
10 we  rea d wh at e ver y wo ma n  k no w
s  and i n Englis h 11 Ha mlet  a
nd i n Englis h 12 Mac Bet h.  And 
you can just  image the language th
at I  spoke when 
I got through. 
Q: In what langua ge did you re ad those?   Were y
ou rea ding t he m in Engli sh?   You're t alking about  
wh en you were in Hi gh School?

A: In  Hi gh  Sch oo l  I  rea d it  in
 E ngli s h.   Th at wa s in  Ne w York
 already.  So t hat was about , t h e  
English wasn't  quite the En
glis h t hat wa s s poke n.  Stra nge , but I 
learned awfully fast
 that it wasn't  
really the English I  shou
ld use on t he street .  So I got  a 
di ploma and I  was accept ed t o Hunter  
Col l ege but i nstea d I got a job i n Dall as, Te xas , as
 a Medi cal Technol ogis t .  
Well, actually as a Lab 
Assistant.  And I lived there.  
And that 's where I met my husban
d, my fir st, I mea n  my se cond 
hus ba nd who is  a  doctor. 
Q: I'd like to talk more 
in detail about that, but 
i t  see ms  a  good poi nt t o as
k, how it wa s that you 
became i nter ested in 
me dicine  and what it was that  made you?  
A: Oh, the y  say I wa s i ntere sted
 in ,  my mo th er  wa s s t
udyi ng De ntis try.  I 
don't think she ever 
fi nished, but as I say her whole fa mily was or ha
d so mething to do with
 Dentistry.  And I was 
always ver y much i nter ested in sc
ie nc e.  Eve n though I was ve ry 
interested in ac
ti ng and dancing, I  
also was a very good student  in scie
nce and t hat 's what, me
di ci ne was  ve ry intere
sting to me.  So the 
closest I got to medici
ne  wa s t o ma rry a doctor  and get  
a  de gree  in Me dical  Tec hnology. 
Q: And you said that
 you wrote  pl ays.  What  were
 the pla ys you wr ote about? 
A: Oh yes, well, this one play, 
that was still in High 
School and all that. One was in elementary 
school.  Oh it was, you know, play
s that a little girl that was very 
mean and then she got very nice 
agai n after she saw what ever .  I don't really reme
mber what happened but  I know t hat  they wer e  
very, ver y se rious  plays. 
 And I reme mber t h
at  there was a perfor mance, oh
 and I played t he l ead in 
the play too, and then 
I  got a  sta nding ovation and pe ople 
were calling for the author .  That I 
remember!  And I re
me mber I had a  pink dres s with a  bi
g bow in the  back
, it was  or ga ndy. 
Q: Wo uld you say you 
were very seri ous? 
A: I was ver y seri ous and I was very 
talented.  At least that
's wh at I was t old .  Or
 I bel i eve d.  I sti l l  
do.  [Laught er]

Q: So do you reme mb er fr om thes
e e arly year s any inc i de nts of an
ti-Semitism?  Did 
you experi ence 
anyt hing?  
A: Yes.  I know I was different.  I know I didn't, 
all the little girls were st
udying to go to the First 
Co mmunion and they believed that 
if you die , r ight a fter you're
 Co mmunion you go straight to 
Hea ve n.  And I wa sn't going to go
 st raight t o He ave n bec a us e I wa
s n 't going to s t udy for the First  
Communion.  And then t uber cul osis wa s ver y pre vale n
t in Pol and.  And my be
st friend's sister die d  
of t uber cul osis at  the age of te
n, I guess, right after her Commun
i o n .   An d she  wa
s buried in her 
whi te dress wit h the veil  
in a white coffin.  And we
 saw her i n the coffin an
d everybody wa s crying. 
But then we were told not to cr
y bec a use she wa s goi ng st rai ght to
 He aven.  And the n my frie nd  
died too.  Al so of tuberc ulosi s
.  And I was very unhappy bec ause  
I did not go to the Co mmunion 
and I di d not  des erve  to be in He ave n.  And the n t he,
 most  o f my  frie nd s t hat
 I socialized with, they 
kne w I wa s Je wish but t hey di d not
, reall y t hey did not ma ke any 
nas t y re marks.  But onc e i n a  
while there mi ght have been boys on 
the street that would, you know, just tease.  Like they tease the 
girls and t hen t hey would call  me Je
wish bec ause my hair was  curly. 
 Most of the ki
ds, my  hair was 
reddi sh- brown or re ddi s h-bl onde and curl y, a nd most 
of the kids, their hair 
wa s st raight and bl onde . 
Q: So j ust  be caus e you'r e hair was cu
rl y, the y t hought t hat you were J e wis h?  
A: And my eyes were dark.  And 
I just looked a little di
fferent than the Polish 
girls with blue eyes 
and strai ght , blonde hair .  Even 
my mother  ha d bl onde hair, but he r 
ha ir was wavy a nd she ha d bl ue  
eyes.  So, I wasn't exposed too 
much to anti-Semitis
m as let's say people wh
o lived in the Jewish  
section of t o wn.  And my brot her , 
who is in the Hebrew school was in the Jewi sh section of town so 

he was, not beat up, but you know
, sort of roughed up 
a little bit on the way hom
e and very often he 
didn't  want  t o go to sc hool but
 my father insi sted that he
 goes  t o t he Hebre w sc hool. 
Q: Di d you have  any i dea  of 
what it  meant  to be Jewish? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
15 
 
 
A: Yes, bec ause  as  I s ai d, I  we nt
 to Sunda y school s o we
 studied the history, 
mai nly history, a nd 
some of t he religi ous observances. 
 But at the same time
, I was the only, no, I a nd Ire ne, we wer e  
the only two Jewish girls in my 
ele me ntar y sc hool .  So, and the re 
were religious instructions in  
school .  So we would go 
to those cl asses because wh
at else could we do?  They were part of the 
curric ulu m.   So we wo ul d 
go to the classes, so I knew all about 
the Catholic religion.  It was ver y  
interesting too.  So, y
ou know, I liked to study just
 anything that I didn't, wa
sn't familiar 
with.  So I  
probabl y know as much about the Ca
tholic religion as all the kids th
at were being prepared for their  
First  Communi on. 
Q: Di d you have  any othe r Je
wi sh friends besides Irene? 
A: Not reall y.  Yes, after I got 
to Hi gh Sc hool.  Ye s, I  ha d Mare
lla .  M arella wa s a not her one  who 
wa s ver y, ve ry intel lige nt  and very, very good stud
ent a nd I we nt to Hi gh 
Sc hool wit h her .  And  
then t her e was another one, Lucia.  That 's right. 
 She  was al so in my Hi gh 
School.  So these were, I 
had a bout three Je wis h girlfri ends a n d I ha d an a w fu
l lot of non-Jewish girlfr
i ends .  And we re ally  
didn't ma ke any distincti on at that
 time.  As far as I was concerne
d, t hat they wer e  Je wis h frie nds  
and  the se we re n on- Je wis h frie nd s.  We  were  ju s t  r
eall y, I dr e ssed just li ke  the girls  a nd I act ed li ke  
the m, e xce pt  that , some ti me s I  e ven we nt t o 
Chur ch wit h t he m .  I kne w all  t he pra yers .  
Q: How did you're  pare nt s fee l  a bout t hat?  

A: They didn't mi nd.  They j ust, th
e y really di dn't mi nd.  The y ha
d a l ot of non-Je wi sh friends t oo. 
As  a matter of fa ct, they had more
 non-Je wi sh frie nds  than Je wish. 
Q: So you lived in the non-Jewish
 section of town and 
will you tell me a little
 bit about the place  
wh ere you lived?  

A: Okay .  It wa s a v e ry b
eauti ful house in a ver y ni ce section of 
town .  It wa s right next to a garden, 
nurs ery busi ness , so it was al wa ys  
in flower s.  The buil d

whi c h  was , a nd mine  was  sp eci
alizing in science, pre-med. 

Q: Do you re me mber  the begi nni
ng of the  Ger ma n occ upati on?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
18 
 
 
A: Oh yes.  I reme mber, first of 
all, we all belonged to 
so mething like R. O.T. C. 
 We all had to have  
military training.  
And we had, my fi ancée had 
to report and I re
me mber we went into a, it was 
August, and we ta lke d about
 war a nd mobili zation.  And he got ca
lled i n, he wa s a year older t ha n I  
so he wa s ahead in school, and he
 was called in to report to the, 
the y got t he uni for m a nd a gun t o  
shoot.  And t hen I had t o repor t 
and I also had a uni for m a nd I  had 
a gun.  But I ne ver had t o reall y  
shoot it, anybody.  But we did have military training b
ecause I'm still pretty
 good at 
the aim. 
Q: Was it mandator y?  
A: It was mandatory. 
 Oh, there was one thing th
at anti-Semitism pr
obably got to me.  Wa s that we 
had s couts, girl scouts and boy scouts .  And I coul
dn't join them.   Because I 
wa s Je wis h.  But I c oul d 
join the military traini
ng.  So that's what I joine
d.  But I couldn't 
be a Girl Scout.  And that probably 
bot here d me  the most be caus e I re all y, a nd I was so 
s urpr i se d, you know, e ven a fter all these  ye ars ,  
when I  came to the States
, to find out that my ch
il dren were Cub Sc out s and 
Girl Scout s.  And t he y  
wer e selli ng Girl Sc out cookies . 
 And I helped the m.  Be ca use I 
could never do it.  So anyway, 
when t he war started, we
 kne w that  s o methi ng was going t o go 
on.  And they ha d air planes fl ying 
and whatnot.  And the n we woke 
up at  5 o'cloc k in the mor ning.  
We hear d e xpl osions a n d we stood  
on the  ba lcony and we  s aw the  pl an
es fl ying up and down a nd we 
couldn't really see it, all their  
ma ne uver s, and you would se e that t h e hi gher  pl a n
es are probably the enem
y and the lower ar e our 
plans and the y are jus t diving int o eac h other .  A
nd then s o me body sai d it wa s for real .  Anywa y, the  
Ger ma n ar my destr oye d most of t he plans, Polis h pl
a nes .  I  think i n Kra kow, 
the first  day.  Als o, I  

think, they were instru
c t ed t o pres e rve t he  city.  And what
 they were bombin
g was mostly the 
military compounds, which were on
 the outskirts of th
e city.  And then ev
erything stopped and I 
think a week later the Germans came
 in.  We coul d hear 
the m mar chi ng at 8 o'cl
oc k in t he mor ning. 
In the meant i me, people 
were leaving the city by whichever means they could.  And the Mo-stof-ski

(ph) fa mily, they ha d a  c ar, a nd 
mot o rcycle s, and they 
left .  But my father 
would not le ave bec aus e  
my mo th er wa s not we
l l  and we had an infant c hi l d.  So we d
ecide d to st a y and see what ha ppens . 
And then I know it was early in the morning when 
we  c oul d he ar [st o mpi ng fe
et sounds ], marc hi ng. 
We l ooke d out through t he wi ndow a nd there wer e 
the Ger ma n sol diers .  And the n the occ upati on  
began.  I know I wouldn't go out of 
t he house for  about fi ve days .  I was very de pres se d and I just , 
we  ha d e nough food bec a use we we
re told to have food
 and we ha d a  mai d  
who br ought sac ks and 
sacks of pot a t oes a nd sugar and ever ybody s aid t o stoc k up on potat
oes and sugar and fl our .  I don't 
know what we  were  s uppos
ed to do wit h all  t hos
e pounds of sugar, but 
we had a lot of sugar. 
Q: And all of your fa mi
l y  was  in the  hous e?  
A: Yes.  So we all st aye d in the house and 
we had enough food until t hi
ngs st arted, you know, we 
had the radio so we 
could listen to what 
was happening.  I don't re me mb er
 that the telephones were 
worki ng or not , but I know
 t hat we coul d hear on the r adi o 
what was going on a nd t hat Ger ma ny 
invaded Poland and the oc
cupation began.  That Wa
rsaw was still being unde
r the siege.  I mean,  
they were si ege for at
 l east three weeks. 
Q: Di d you observe anything from your wi
ndow, what was going 
on in the streets? 
A: Yes , that they wer e marchi ng ba
c k  and forth a n d, you see , we had 
the black out.  So, but then we  
didn't have t o have a bla ck out any more.  But be fo
re Septemb er 1st, well ac
tuall y for a whole week 
we had to keep the wi ndows dark
, but there we re no bombi ngs a nd 
t hings were pr et ty nor ma l. 
Exc ept t hat you couldn't  buy anythi ng 
in t he st or e.  Of vi negar.  Th
er e was a lot of vi negar on the  
shelf because I don't think anybod
y needed vinegar.  [L aughter] 
Q: I'd like to go back a little bit,
 a bout  you had me ntioned that  you 
ha d t o st op s c hool
 at some poi nt 
and then you were continuing priv
ate lessons in th
e home after that? 
A: No.  This wa s not  pri v ate le ss ons  j ust for  
me, but t he t eac he rs orga nize d privat e schooling.

Q: Decemb er of 1939. 

A: And then it was forbidden becaus

Q: And this wa s 1939?  

A: That was December

 in January, 1940.  But 
I t hink by January we  di d

Q: So a f ter  t hat fi ve  days  that  you s pe nt

Q:  We  l e ft  o f f j u st  at  t h e  begi
nning of t he Ge r ma n oc cupati on.  
And there  wa s one t hi ng t hat you 
mentioned which we didn't 
talk about a little bit.  
You said that you had a 
fiancée at the time and  
you s aid tha t  you were  
considering yoursel ves  to
 be e nga ge d.  What  
di d you me an by t h at?  
A: We ll you know, I met  hi m jus t  
the  Summe r  be fore a nd he wa s on
e of the boys, young me n that 
wa s very popular  a nd we star ted ju
st going out, dating.  And in th
ose da ys you j ust held ha nds.  
That's all.  And th
en we were talking that 
eventually maybe we
 will get married because we had a 
lot of things in common.  An d he 
introduced me to his family wh
o liked me very mu ch, but there  
was nothing about getting 
married really because 
nobody was gettin
g ma rried until they fi nished 
school a nd s t arted t o ma ke a li vi
n g.  An d s o  we  wer e  
just beginning.  We  
were going t oget he r  
steadi ly.  And so t hat 's the sit uati on. 
Q: Wh at wa s  his  n a me?  

A: Hi s na me was Yannosh Fanyo 
( ph) .  He  wa s Hungari an but  
everybody called him Yannick, 
which is Polish 'John'. 
 And his family spoke Hung
arian.  They spoke a little
 bit Polish, a lot of 
German and English,
 but mainly Hungarian.  
And so at home he was c alle d Yannos h or Ya nchi e,  
but  I c alle d hi m Ya nni ck.  And he pl
a yed the violi n very, ver y, well 
he  pla y ed pia no too but  he  was  
a very good violi nist  and his  si ster pl aye d t he pi
a no and his  mother  pl aye d  
too.  And hi s fat her  was  
in so me ki nd of an i mp ort-e xpor
t business, I don't know
 exactly what it was, 
but t he y were quit e  
well-t o- do a nd the y ha d Hungaria n passports a nd they 
lived in a very beautifu
l apartme nt, also in a 
very nice section of town, and they were very 
cultured people and they 
had musical ____________ 
too, whic h use t o be a very popul ar  past ti me 
i n Poland.  Especiall y during the war where t h e 
movie s were  close d, movie house s 
were closed, theaters wer e closed
 a nd t here wa s rea lly no plac e  
to go.  Ever ythi ng was take n over by the Ger ma ns .
  NightCl ubs were  alwa ys ver y popular in  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

Pol and.  There were a lot  
of the m in Krakow.  And 
cafes.  They wer e all 
t ake n over by t h e Ger ma ns  
so there was really no pl ace to go 
and not hing to do, s o a lot of peop
le e ntert aine d at home.  And so, 
especiall y the Fanyo fami
l y wa s ve ry musical  a nd 
t hes e we re ve ry, ver y pl eas ant t hings, ti mes  
where  the y had t he  ____________. 
 So t hat 's how the stor y we nt. 
Q: Di d he  s p end a ny ti me  at your 
home with your  fa mil y as  wel l? 
A: Oh ye s.  He would c o me to our house and sta y
 for dinner and my pare nts  liked hi m very muc h.  
And he was a very, very pleas ant fellow to be around.  And al so we entertaine d some friends until 
things started to get pretty
 bad.  I mean as far as
 the Germans were concerne
d.  And the fa mily still  
lived quite well because they, as Hu
ngari an citi z ens , and at that ti me Hungar y was s ort of part ne rs  
with Germany, they coul
d purchase food and ne cessiti es i n t he s o-call ed vol k-doyc h (ph) stor es,  
which were off limits fo r the Polis
h people and de fini tely
 off-limits for the Je
ws.  But pe ople of  
Ger ma n des cent c oul d regist er the ms elve s as 
vol k-doyc h (ph) a nd they
 could participate in 
purc has es i n thos e s peci al  store s.  Whi c h were  full  
of food and anyt hing you 
want ed, re ally.  So t he  
Fanyo's (ph) lived qu
ite well and I enjoye
d being wi th them. 
Q: How did you me et hi m?  

A: The s wi m mi ng pool.  This was a not her past t i m
e t hat we had i n the 
summer .  St arting whe n  
school wa s out in June, we all w
oul d gat her in a  publi c  s wi m mi ng po
ol.  It was a huge, huge pool  
and that 's where we woul d spend 
da ys .  That was  t he past  ti me . 
Q: Do you remember  feel ing 
a frai d during thi s ti me?  
A: No.  At t he be ginning, now I 
felt very une as y about the Ge r ma ns 
a nd a bout the whole sit uati on.  
But we wer e , at the be ginning, we
 were very fre e to do whate v
er we wa nte d to do.  I don't 
remember exactl y when they starte
d regist ering, but it wa s ri ght at 
t he be ginning, t hat  Je ws had t o  
regist er a nd then I thi nk 
that we  di dn't have  to
 st art weari ng the white, 
in  Kr ak ow y o u wor e  th e

white ar m bands with the bl ue st
ar  of Davi d, a nd everyt hing, th
e Germans ha d a system.  You see 
they didn't j ust file eve r ythi ng, 
all the bad things all at once.  
It was ve ry, very gra dual so you 
somehow seemed to get use to it.  And at fi rst it 
was registering, then it wa
s the ar mbands, then you  
coul dn't ride in the fr ont of the stre
etca r, the n you c oul dn't ride t he st
re etcar at all.   You coul dn't g o  
into the park.  You couldn't do a lo
t of things  but it was 
all so gradual  that  you 
al most  didn't realize  
that t hat wa s  happe ning.  And t hen 
they started talk about 
t he ghetto.  That al l 
the Jews will have to  
live in the ghetto.  But that didn™
t happen until really 19
41.  And so a whole ye
ar went by where we 
move d ar ound a nd t hings wer e quite, you ma y sa y eve n
 safe.  And my par ent
s wer e ge tting re ady t o  
go to ghett o  and I said t hat I did not  want t o go to
 ghe tto be caus e, I just fel t , tha t 's when I reall y  
started to get  afrai d.  And I reme mber I even sai d
 s o methi ng t h at, what woul
d happe n if they would  
just cl ose t h e ghet t o one  beaut i ful da y and set fir e
 to it.  And everybody 
t hought I wa s just being 
ridiculous.  I  me an, nobody 
woul d do a thi ng li ke that. 
 Why woul d the y do it?  
 I said, I don't know. 
We  rea d a b out Christ al naught  (p
h).  We read about things that
 happe ne d in Ger ma ny and why 
wouldn't the y ha ppen he re?   Ever
ybody thought  I wa s just r i dicul o
us a n d exaggerati ng.  And the  
Mo-st o f-s ki 's (ph) ma de arrange me nt s to take ove r
 the tanner y.  And ha ve my father, my Uncle a nd 
my br othe r work t here a s esse ntial 
to running the tannery so
 they would be sa fe a n
d, at that time, we 
still lived in our apartme nt.  And 
since they couldn't conv
eniently go by street 
car, the Mo-stof-ski's 
(ph) had a horse a nd buggy right in t h eir bac k yar d  instea d of in the gara ge .  And there was a sta ble  
in the back and they would transp
ort my fathe r  and my br other  and 
my Uncle to the fa ctory, whic h 
wa s q uite a wa ys a w ay .  It
 was at  the other  end of 
the t own.  And s o e ver yt hi
ng seemed to be going 
quite well and the business 
wa s good.  Mr. Mo-stof - sk
i (ph) was  running it a nd he was a lawyer , he  
kne w all kinds of a ngles as far as bus i ness was c o
ncerned, and they gave 
my father and my Uncle 
mone y to live on.  And plenty.  Th
en the Ger ma ns  started i nva ding pe ople ' s apart me nts  and home s  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
24 
 
 
and they si mply taking what ever they wanted t o 
take .  The y ca me one eve ning to our house a n d 
they tagged furniture and they 
tagge d  the ___________, whic h wa
s our most pre cious pos ses sion, 
and several other things, an
d that's when my father 
started to get a 
little bit conc
erned, not scared.  
And t hen again t he Mo-stof-ski 's (p
h)  came t o the rescue.  Oh, the 
J e ws wer e  for bid
den to own any 
furs, fur coat s, and being in the 
l eathe r busi nes s, of c our se, my  mo ther ha d not one but sever al fur  

coats, and t h e Mo-st o f-ski 's (ph) t o
ok thos e.  And we  ha d some very
 beaut iful furni ture, especiall y  
my pare nt 's bedr oom set  wa s ma ho
ga ny and s o me  ver y e x
o tic wo od s.   The r e were  lar g e ward ro bes  
and dressers, so they took that.  
And several other things.  And also 
jewelry.  So thin
gs were still not 
bad.  But then when 
the talk about ghetto was clos
er and closer, I just said, "I
 will not go to ghetto".  
And that 's when a friend 
of ours s uggested t hat Yannos h and 
I  get marrie d.  And thi s way I would  
be a Hungarian citizen, I 
would be on his passport.  I didn't ha
ve to go to ghetto. 
 And my parents  
wer e sort of opposi ng t o i t .  Th
e y thought I wa s wa y to
o young to get ma rrie d.  I wa s onl y ni netee n,  
but I  had j us t  tur ned ni ne teen t hat  Ja nuary, 1941
.  And t he y, but they agr e
ed.  And as a matter  of 
fa ct, my mot her ga ve me her wedd
ing band and my father
 ga ve Ya nnos h his we
ddi ng band.  So that  
we could have weddi
ng bands for getting married
 and we did get 
married by some Ra
bbi.  It was a 
very short ceremony.  My 
mother was too ill, as I 
me ntioned before, she was 
sick after the birth of 
my siste r .  And so she wa s not 
wit n essing, but my father went 
and my brot her a
nd Ya nnos h and I  
and we ha d a very br ie f cere mony.  But we we re
 mar r ied l egall y and I mo ved i nto his pare nt 's  
house , or a p art ment .  And the n I we nt to vi sit 
my, by then my mother 
and fat her a nd Unc l e and 
Aunt and my brot her and my
 si ster  moved t o t h e ghett o.  They 
had a fairly large 
apar t ment, whi c h 
they shared, but not  for very l ong 
bec ause  the y put more and more peop
le into t he ghett o.  They also 
brought people fr om other towns 
and they ha d to, they were allo
wed only one be droom.  And t he n  
my Uncle a n d my Aunt had another very s mall be dr
oom, but my father, my sister , my brot her , the y 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
25 
 
 
all were in one be droom.  And t he n the y all s h ar
ed t he ki tc hen and one  ba
throom.  So it wasn't 
exactly the luxury we lived in bu
t still my father was 
working and they had en
ough fo od because h e  
coul d, he we nt to wor k e very day a nd he brought 
back food and there wer e  no reall y pr eserves and 
refrige rator s as suc h at that ti me
.  In Poland the y were
 in ve ry bad ________
__.  You we nt shopping 
ever yda y for  food a nd s o  he brou
ght fre sh food e veryda y.  And my
 mother was able to, with the 
help of my Aunt, to 
run the house hol d up t o a poi nt.  So thi n
gs weren't really ba
d.  And I went  and  
visite d the m  practic ally ever y da y.  Bec ause I was fr
ee t o go wheree ver I  wa nted.  I didn't ha ve to  
wear the band. 
Q: Why not?   Why di dn't you
 have to wear the band? 
A: Because I was a Hungarian citizen
.  At least I thought 
I was.  There was so
mething scribbled i n  
his pas sport, I di dn't have a pa ss por
t of my own.  But we 
went  t o s o me offic e and t he y s c ribble d my  
name on the passport.  Evidently
 it was still a German consul, but 
he couldn't issue me a passport, 
but he put my name on my
 husband's passpo
rt, so I was, at least I cons
idered myself safe.  Until one 
bea uti ful da y, the r e was  what is c al l ed _____
________, whi ch means 't o 
catch'.  There was a 
catchi ng bus iness goi ng on.  The Ger ma n pol ice would 
st op e very str eetc a r and let all t he pe ople out 
and check their identi fi cation.  And 
that was the fi rst time
 that I got a taste of
 wh at could happen. 
Because I did not ha ve an identifica
ti on.  I tol d the m my hus b and has 
the identification.  I got a sl ap  
over my fac e to s hut up.  And I 
was  put on a tr uck with a not her gi
r l and there wer e several other  
people on it .  And we  we re taken t o t he Gest apo of
fice .  And I don't re me mb
er t he address exactl y, 
but I know it was the main Gesta
po he adquarte rs.  And the girl that
 was wit h me was J e wis h to o an d  
she had no i denti ficati on at all.  And she was cr
yi ng and waili ng and s he s aid, "t he y ar e goi ng to ki ll 

us."  An d I said, "Oh, don'
t be ridiculous."  I mea
n, I just gave them my  
husband's phone numb er. 
They still were allowed to have a 
phone, the Hungarian citizens.  So 
they will get in touch with him 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
26 
 
 
and everyt hi ng wil l be al l right. 
 And what I didn't know about th
e  girl , evidentl y she  wa s outsi de  
the ghetto without pa per s, hi ding.  And s he was waiti
ng for s o me fals e pa pers to be gi ven t o her .  
But at that point she didn't have 
t he m.  We ll anyway, the 
Gestapo were quite me an t o her .  They  
wer e all uni f or med and t hey were 
qui te mea n to us.  They wer e 
shouti ng a nd t he n as ki ng que stions  
and I  ke pt on insisti ng t h at I wa
s a Hungarian citi zen and they shou
ld get in touch with my husband 
and let me go.  And I re
member they put us against the wall
, fa cing the wall.  And it was a little 
creepy because t he gi rl started t o 
cr y and she start ed to poi nt a t  th
e s pot s on the wa ll a nd s he s ays , 
"That looks like blood and they ar
e going to shoot us, a
nd I know they will shoo
t us".  And they did  
have guns.  And, but that was the 
first time when I faced that mayb
e they will shoot 
me.  And it's a  
very funny feeling.  You know?  
 You are c o mpl etely helpl es s. 
 You cannot do anythi ng.  And you 
just sta nd t h ere.  And you feel 
ki nd of a cree py fe eling on t h e bac k
 of, between you're shoulders, 
and you wonder, are t hey goi ng t o 
shoot bet ween t he shoulders or ar
e the y goi ng t o s hoot you i n the 
head?  And I think I got a little bit si
ck to my stomach but I didn't cry.
  I just was wa
iting.  And then 
one of the guys wa lke d up to us a
nd just turned us around by the 
shoulder s and start ed to ask more  
que stions .  And the y took the gi
rl awa y, but t hey were a s king
 me more q uesti on s and mo re  
que stions , a nd t hey wanted t o kn
ow where my parent s were and 
why I was there and what was I 
doi ng?   And I don't e xac tly re me mbe r  all the a ns wer
s I ga ve the m, but I know 
t hat I insist ed t ha t  
they c a ll my hus ba nd.  And fi nally 
t h ey br ought s o me woma
n who took me to a, 
I gue s s a kind of a  
ma ss pris on for other  wome n t hat th
ey were cat ching or who ever t h
ey were, and we just slept on  
the fl oor.  There was a bucket in 
the corner.  And no 
sanitary fa cilities of 
any kind except the 
buc ket .  And I di dn't li ke it, but I  de ci ded I a m go
ing to just sit and wait. 
 And t he ne xt morning, I  
didn't get a n ythi ng t o eat , the next mo rning the y ga
ve us s o me coffe e and 
s o me br ead a nd a nywa y, I

stayed t her e for about tw
o days.  And low and beho
ld, my hus band ca me  t o 
get me and they let me 
go. 
Q: Di d the y know that
 you wer e J e wis h?  
A: Yes.  But they let me go 
because I was a Hu
ngarian citizen. 
Q: Were you registered? 
 Did you go to register
 when it was required?  
A: No.  I di dn't regi ster beca use ,
 you see, I was not goi ng t o go to ghe
tto.  So I didn't have the, it 
wa s calle d t he c he m-c ar d (ph).  So
 I wa sn't re gistere d Je wi sh be
ca use t hat 's whe n you ha d to 
regist er, when you went  to ghett o
 a nd I did not  regist er bec ause I  
was n 't goi ng t o go ther e.  But 
anybody who couldn't prove they ar
e either Polish identity or Germ
an identity was Jewish.  Or had 
something to hide.  So th
ey let me go and we 
still were in the ap
artment at that ti
me.  And that was 
the end of my going out.
  Beca use  I j u st would 
not go out of t he  hous e. 
Q: Wh en  wa s thi s?  

A: Th at was about the beginning of
 1941.  It  was spring of 1941 beca us e I  know
 I sti ll had my nice , 
winter coat  wit h t he sabl e fur  no
 le ss .  M y mother  ha d s able s t h
at she  br ought fro
m Russia and she  
fi nally, one day, it was s
till before the war, she decided that I 
can have a coat tr
i mmed with these 
sable s.  And I had a big mu
ff and a fur coll ar and a hat.  And I  ha
ve a pict ure of that some plac e, i n a  
fa mi ly album.  So anyway
, I stayed home.  I wo ul
d not l e ave .  But t h en t hings ha ppe ne d to the  
Hungaria ns t oo.  And we  wer e e v
icted from the fancy apart ment . 
Q: This  was  in 1941 als o ? 

A: No th at wa s alrea dy  in 19 42
, I belie ve.  Be caus e  that wa s a f
ter Hungary, no, I really don't 
remember exactl y the dates, but I 
know that it wa s, in 1942 we 
li ved i n an apart m ent near the  
barber, near the castl e.  And t hen
 t h ey deci ded t o tear t his down
, tear the buildin
g down because 
they were  going to build some thing else there.  
And we found an apartment 
near the ghetto in the

basement .  And my
 mot her-i n-law and my
 sister- i n-law made 
a living by t eachi ng Engl ish in secret . 
And t hat 's where t hese fr iends of 
min e  ca me  int o pictur
e.  I wrote t he whole story about them t o,  
ho w t he y we re h e lpi ng  us  
thr oughout  i t .  They wer e he lpi ng us
 with the apartments and with other 
things because it was one 
of my  school friends a
nd her mother.  The mot h
er had a small  jewelr y  
store and per f ume s t ore  a nd she  ha d 
a ll kinds of c onnecti ons .  And, bu
t this is a stor
y for itsel f and I 
have about fourteen pa
ges written up for the _________ ____
__ _______ about it
.  And she was 
very, very he lpful .  M y mother
-in-law had quite a bit of jewelr
y, which Mrs . ____________ wa s her  
na me , woul d sell it for us  for a good
 price .  And s he was very, very 
helpful .  And t hen finally, s he  
also per mi t t ed my si ster -in-la w 
and my mot her- i n-la w t o use  thei
r apart ment for classes, for t he 
Englis h less ons .  Beca us e this was t h e onl y mea n s of
 support we had at t h at
 ti me.  M y hus ba nd was  
worki ng i n a Ger ma n furnit ure stor e but a fte r a  wh
ile he lost that job a
nd so he wa sn't  wor king  
anymore.  Then we moved, when 
t he  ghett o was being e nlarged and 
the apartment in the baseme nt 
where we lived was going to  be enclosed in the ghetto, we had to
 move.  And we mo
ved to a village 
called Why- give- nee k-e e  (ph), whic h was a  s ubur b of
 Kra kow.  And we re nt
ed a house  out  in the  
country fr om a man c alle d Borcha 
Hur-oog (ph), t o this day I r e me mbe r , and it was a Kr akow- o fs ka  
493, or  something li ke  t hat
 address and I tr ied t o fi
nd it.  And Why-gi ve-nee k-e e ( p h) is  a  bi g c i ty 
now.  At that time it 
wa s  a count ry- ki nd of a s mal l house wi
th no i ndoor  plumbi ng and the wat er 
wa s from t he  well , you ha d to put 
a bucket down and t hen
 crac k up a buc ke t  and bri ng t he water up . 
And it wa s a n outhous e i n the yar d. 
 Als o a not her  thing that happene d
 in the meantime is that my  
fat her-i n-la w had a stroke  and he  ha d a he art c ondi
tion and he was partially pa
ralyzed.  He was in a 
bad s ha pe.  But sl owly he rec over ed some wha t  th
at he was able to walk
 around but one ar m was  
paral yze d a n d his  speec h wa s sli ghtl y  slurre d, so he
 stayed home mo st of th

grandmot her  while t he s i ster, my husba nd's sist e r  
and hi s mother we nt t o 
town to give Engli sh 
lessons .  So t hat was my c ountry livi ng. 
Q: So tell me again, how many
 pe opl e you were  li ving wit h i n you're  hus ba nd's house?  
A: There  were s i x of us, i ncl udi ng me .  Ther e 
was the grandmother, the father , the mother, the 
sister , my husband and I.
  There were six of us
.  And we ha d a kitc he n 
and a bedroom.  And the  
grandmot her , the fat her a nd mother 
slept in the bedroom and this is 
their, my husband and I slept i n  
the kit che n on s ort of a rolled out mattress .  Duri
ng the da y we r olle d it up a nd put it  aside a nd a t  
night you unrolled it .  Sort of an 
ol d- day fut on.  And it  was  very pr
imitive type of 
li vi ng.  And we 
lived there until 1944, 
Ap ril of 1944.  Wh en Germany invaded Hungary, 
they were not alias  
anymore, they were conquered co
untry and that's wh en 
the Hungari an Je ws  start ed to be  de port ed. 
Q: Oka y, be fore we go i nto that , would you, when you live d  in this country spot, in t his s malle r 

place  in the s uburb of Kra kow, 
di d you continue  to go to the  gh
etto to visit 
you're family?  
A: Yes .  I continued.  And not onl
y that, but I took the street car .  I di
d ge t some kind of a  paper fr om 
the consulat e at that ti me, some ki
nd of an identifi cation so then I 
started walking to
 t o wn agai n and 
I was a little bit more fr ee. 
 I remember even, I baked 
cookies, which I would ta
ke to town and try to 
sell.  I sold them most of the ti
me , they we re ver y  good cookie s.  The y wer e warti me c o okie s, they 

weren't really delicious but they we
r e as good as you c oul d get the m 
at that time , so I was in cookie 
busi ness for  a whi l e.  An
d also, by then, i n
 1943 the ghe tto wa s cl os ed
.  By  that 
time, it was 
liqui date d.  By t hat ti me  my fath
er wa s gone , my mot her a n d my 
si ster .  And my br other was i n 
Por oshkov, i n the camp, labor  ca
mp.  And Ches- wa f (ph) wa s gi
ving hi m the money i n food a n d 
also giving me some.  So
 he was supporting us qu
ite generously.  Becaus
e they were still running 
the factory.  But that was after 
March, 1943.  S
till April, 1944. 
Q: So when did you're
 father, wh en was you'
re  fat her de port ed?

A: My father was deported with th
e first transport from Krakow, whic
h was, as far  as
 I remember, it  
wa s fir st fe w da ys  in June
 when the y r ounde d t h e m up.  I  thi nk 
June  3r d or J une 5th, I thi nk J une  
5th i s when the tr ain l e ft an

d was when I was s t andi ng and 
disc ussi ng al l wit h my husband, wait ing for the pe
opl e to le a ve the ghett o and be ma rche d to t he 
train stati on.  And when we were 
in Krakow, the fi rst ti me, I was te
lli ng Robert , des c ribing it , a nd 
we  were  looking for it  a n d we  
coul dn't find 
it until . . . 
[End  of Si de A of Tape 2] 
Q: And coul d you just st art at th
e be ginning wit h  that stor y again?
  Yo u and you're husband we nt  
bac k t o Kra k ow?  
A: Robert, this husband. 
 Because that 's  al
re ady a thir d husband.  Ok
ay.  Anyway, Robert and I 
we nt bac k t o Pol and and we we nt t o the __
_________ for th
e ____________, 
whic h wa s, th e  
__________, a drug stor e which 
wa s in the ghe tto, a nd ri ght no
w it is a museum
.  And Mr s .  
Swaveka Karlingska (ph) is one of the, was one of 
the, I don't know if she s
till is there, people that 
ran the muse um, a nd s he told us that t he pe opl e fr om 
ghetto.  You se e, I only 
thought t hat the y wen t  
to the main train station but she to
ld us exactl y where t hey went an
d s o we  trace d tha t  r oad and we 
found the grassy kno
ll and I told Robert that th
ere was a little religious stat
ue on it and we fo und it. 
Bec ause I  re me mber  sta n ding ri ght next t o it  whe n
 the people from ghetto in
 r o ws of four start ed  
coming out and very slowly th
ey we re mar che d wit h the SS 
men a nd the dogs and the whol e  
busi nes s.  Ri ght t hrough t he stre ets .
  And I di d s e e my fat h
er .  And a ft er that, I thi nk I s t arted t o cr y 
and my hus b and gr abbed me .  Bec a us e there were 
a lot of people, Polis h pe ople st anding there a nd 
jeering reall y, and "Getti ng rid of
 the  Jews ", and so on.  And I 
know he was afraid t ha t  somebody 
will notice that I am cryi
ng so he grabbed me and 
led me out of there, ag
ainst my better judgment,  
but anyway, I left .

Q: You knew about the deport
ation before it happened? 
A: Well we were told that they ar
e going, that some of t he pe ople have t o deport and have to re port  
at this particular offi ce.  And th
at they will be resettled to a, to 
some factory.  
And they wanted  
people who wer e trai ne d in certai n j obs .  And 
Mr. Mo- stof-ski ( ph), __
___________ fat her , wa s  
trying to get my father out of t hat re gi stration be ca us
e he sai d t hat he nee de d hi m to r un the fact ory. 
But they said that he had my Uncl
e to do i t so he didn't nee d  my 
father.  You se e,
 my  fat h er wa s 
really just in his fi fties but he 
ha d white hair a nd so he looke d pr
oba bly much older t han he re all y 
wa s.  And Mo-st o f-s ki (ph)  couldn'
t  do a nyt hing to get  hi m out of th
at .  So I  knew that t hey ar e 
goi ng t o be  deport ed but I  wa sn't s u
re whether my fat her was rescued 
or not.  Mo-sto
f-s ki  (ph) didn't  
know either.  So t hat 's why I we nt
 to the knoll, to see who was r
eally goi ng, and I sa w s o me frie nd s  
of mi ne a nd anot her girl  t hat I  went
 to school with and he
r  fat he r  and her si st er.  But t he y wer e very 
hea vily guar ded a nd one  coul d not do anythi ng. 
 And my fat her, I re me
mber hi m st andi ng t here  
with a small suitcase and he had this ma nnerism of
 scra tchi ng hi s hea d when thi ngs  were n't  so, I 
re me mber hi m scr atching his hea d.  And the n my hu
sband took me away from
 there.  And then, you  
see, I coul d go to the ghetto by just showi ng t hat
 piece of paper that I ha
d fr om the gover n ment. 
And so I went to the ghetto the 
ne xt morni ng bec ause t he y ke pt th
e ghetto closed that day, but the  
next morning they again let the 
wor kers go out and peopl e come in
.  So I went t o visit and my  
mother, of course, was very, very upset.  But she sa
id that she was hoping th
at everything will be all 
right.  They promised that
 they will be put to work
 and then ma ybe even she 
will be able to join him 
later on.  And it seems to me now
, I don't quite r e me mbe r  whether 
it wa s  my Un cle o r  whe t her it  
wa s my fat her, but she  got a po
st  card fr om somewhere, that 
the tr ans port a rri ved a nd t ha t  
everybody was all right.  And then
 there is a crazy thing, my moth
er was superstitiou
s or something, 
she bel ieved in all kinds of sign
s and, if a bird knocked on the  window it wa s a bad si gn, a nd my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
32 
 
 
fat her l e ft he r his watc h, his poc ket
 watch, and she  said the gla ss cr
ac ke d.  I sa w it.  I sa w the gla ss  
cracked.  And she said
 he  was dea d.  And I  tol d her, " This 
is silly."  Maybe so
me body knocked the 
wat ch over a nd what not , and s he 
s ai d " No" , it  was by her be d ta ble a nd all of a s udden t he glas s 
cracked.  And I didn't bel i eve that
, I felt it was all crazy.  And anyw
a y, I woul d come t o the ghetto 
and bri ng her the food and what ever  else they ne
eded and I went ther e practicall y every day.  My 
brot her was in _________ 
and I sa w hi m and he coul
d come  out a nd visit  t
oo.  And then he had a  
girl frie nd on the outsi de, 
a Polish girl that use to work in th
e l a b, t he __________ labor atory.  An d 
then, when Mo-st o f-s ki (ph) t ook 
over the fact or y he  trans fer red 
her t o the fact or
y and she was  a  
secret ary t here and she was helpi ng my br other.  
And one  da y, she t old me
 that  he wa s taken on a  
transport to Czestochowa, to some 
fa ctory.  And I  ne ver hear d fr om 
hi m a g ain.  Thou
gh her br other , 
Da- ne w-c he f (ph)  was  he r na me , her brot her li ve d in
 Czestochowa, an
d he  ke pt in touc h with my  
brot her .  But when we we nt ba ck
 t o Poland, I t r ied to fi nd out 
wh at, wheth e r it wa s a ca mp or a  
fa ctor y, wha t  ha ppe ne d t o those  people i n Cze st o
chowa and I just couldn't 
find it .  Na-new-sha's 
(ph) brot her died and I ha d her  ad
dre s s and I wr ote  to her ma ny ti
mes, but she 's no
t a young woma n 
anymore .  And she  may be dea d for  
all I know.  So she is the only 
one who really was i n  touch wit h  
my brot her before I was a rreste d.  So I  have no id
e a wha t  happene d to hi m.  And e ver y year we go, I 
try to find her, I try to fi nd 
anybody that woul d know about a
nybody from _____
_______ ta ke n to  
Czestochowa, and I wasn't able to
 fi nd anybody.  So that's the st
ory on that.  And t hen we ar e 
coming cl oser to t he march, thir
t een's or whenever that was, 
that wa s 1943, wh
ich was the like 
liqui dati on of the  Kra kow ghetto.  
My mother was partiall
y pa ralyze d t oo, I mea n her a r m was ba d. 
But  s he sti ll coul d get ar ound.  An
d my si ster wa s five  ye ars old,
 s he wa s  bor n M arch 6th.  And I  
wa s there for her birthda y.  I brought  her choc ola t
e and st uff, and s o me toys.  And you coul d, th e  
streetc ar we nt fr om _____________
___, the place that I lived out in
 the country.  It had to go  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
33 
 
 
through the ghett o.  So I  would cr oss  the ghet t o a nd 
the n get out and go through the gate.  And it  
took three days for 
t he  ghetto to be  li qui date d, but  I ma de 
ar ra nge me nts  wi th Da n-o- sha  (ph) to get  
my sist er out.  My mother didn't 
wa nt to, but she wa s ve
ry realistic and she th
ought, yes, that I  
should ta ke t he girl .  We had fal se pa pers for her 
and I br ought Dan- o-s ha (ph) the girl 's clothes and 
I remember there was 
a little coverlet for her cr
ib, she was five years old 
but she still had it, and we 
bribed t he guard and I was suppose 
t o go in and t ake her out .  And 
t he ghetto was cl
osed.  I could  
not get i n.  They still let t he street car go thr ough b
ecause that was the only 
way that people coul d get 
fr om one end of the town to the 
ot he r.  But the doors were cl osed
.  The SS me n were ha ngi ng on the  
cars t o make sur e that no
body eve n opened t he  wi ndow or  anything
 a nd let  pe ople  go 
there.  I don't 
know how many ti mes  I we nt bac k 
and fort h t he first day.  And th
ere was no way I ca n get  the  c hil d  
out .  And that was  it.  And the n
, you pr oba bly sa w enough of the  
phot ogr aphs a nd pi c t ures , fr o m  
Schindler's film and fr om this a
nd t hat, and you know what it looke d 
like.  It  looked probably muc h  
worse than a nyt hing you sa w in 
the movie s.  And so, I don't kno
w what happe ned.  I know so me  
people were taken on tr
ansport to Prostejov bu
t these were young peop
le who could be still 
wo rking.  Th en mo
st people wer e kil l ed ri ght i n t h e ghetto, but
 then they said that
 there wer e sever al  
trans port s of wome n a nd childr en ta ke n to Ausc hwitz
.  And I could not find, 
I was in Auschwitz and 
I tried to fi nd out whether there we
re transport s that came.  There 
wa s anot her craz y story, that there  
wa s one tr uck wit h the  childre n and women that
 broke down a nd di dn't co me wi th the mai n  
transport.  And that the people on that truck were 
put in the camp and not 
killed right away.  And I 
had this imagination that  
my mother and sist er were on t hat tr
uck.  But e v en t h
en , my  mo ther  was  
crippled really and I know she co
uldn't possibly su
rvive.  And my little sist
er, every time we go to 
Auschwitz, I watch the movie that th
ey show and there is 
one little girl 
with these big 
eyes, showing 
her numbe r on her ar m, a nd I al wa ys t hink maybe i t  
was my sist er.  Sorry.  And Che s- wa p  (ph) ga ve

me pict ures of my sister  when 
she was about t hree year
s old.  My father, Che s- wa p (ph) wa s a n 
a mateur photogra pher too and he 's 
the one who, my fathe r  as ked whet
her he could ma ke pict ure s of  
my sister and a couple of 
years ago when we were vi
siting, he said I have 
something for you.  And  
yet I didn't bring t he lar g e one, but
 I j ust br ought t hese s mall ones .  
And I had thi s fa nta sy that, t he y 
say that you can take
 photogra phs a nd make c o mputer pict ures
 to see what  a chil
d woul d look at an 
older a ge , and I alwa ys have the fa
nta sy that ma ybe I could have that 
done , but it 's just c r azy.  Eve n  

if I find out that the little girl, or some other little 
girl in the picture was a 
survivor, how am I going 
to find my si ster?   So, on
e thing that I knew, that 
s he ha d a mol e on her le ft shoulder.  And se vera l  
years ago there was a st ory of a Is
raeli actress.  She wa s exactly th
e  sa me a ge as my sister  woul d  
have been.  And she was in Ausc
hwitz as a little child and she surv
ived.  And I wa
s going to writ e 
to her but  I t hought s he would thin
k it was some  crank, y
ou know, writi ng her . 
 And I wa s going to 
write to her to ask her whether sh

er .  But you know, you live  with  
these things, and, 
oh, stop, pleas e. 
 

[Pause here while interviewee is overwhelmed with emotion] 

 

Q: Okay.  You were just
 telling me about the liqui
dation of the ghetto, the Kr
akow ghetto.  It was in  
1943, and you were talk
ing a little bit before that 
about your father and that
 your mother had this 
bad e xperi ence of . . . 

A: A premonition. 

Q: A premonition.  Did you
 ever hear anything ab
out your father again?  
A: No.  Not until we got to the __
_________ or when the 
museum in the 
former ghetto, in Krakow.  
And we found t he c hronol
ogy of t he bands, that pe ople  were
 tra nsport ed fr om, wi th the firs t  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

transport fr om Krakow, that they
 wer e trans por ted to Bel zec a n d the n she pulled out , M r s. Kar-li ng-
ska ( ph) pull ed out the book a nd said, 
this is what happened in Belzec
.  And that was the first time I  
found out what happene d to my fa
ther.  And the n the next tr ans por
t wa s in October , I  belie ve, and 
my Uncle a n d his wi fe went on t hat tr ans port .  So, 
and that was the fi rst time
 I fo und out that there 
wa s s uc h pla ces, at  Belze c.  I ha d 
no i dea .  After al l the se ye ars. 
Q: You thought that you're 
father might still be alive? 
A: No.  Not accor ding t o  
the descri pti on of the book, in t he bo
ok.  I mean, I know
, well , the book 
that we got, there was one sur viv
or t h at esc ape d a nd no body else. 
 And I know tha t  
there is, wel l  
first of all, my father wo
uld be 100 ye ars ol d, s o th
at wouldn't be possible, of
 course, but I know that 
he did not , nobody sur v ived from t h
at transport.  So, at least I ma
y s a y I fel t  a lit
tle bit better 
knowi ng exa ctly what ha ppe
ne d.  Be c ause I thi nk not knowing is 
pr oba bly t he wor st part  of it.  And 
it is a little bit late for 
me to start searching because, even if
 my brother survived
, he would be 72 
years ol d.  And how many pe ople do 
you know t hat lived to be 72 
years old?  I don't know too 
many.  So it is kind of little late
 to start really searching.  But I 
still somehow believe
 that maybe my 
little sister survived.  Maybe I shou
ld have looked for her.  Wh en 
we go back, we ca
n look.  I know 
she was not in Ber gen- B elsen, but maybe she wa
s in Auschwitz.  And ma
ybe  she was  in Ber ge n,  
no, t he y di dn't have chil dren i n Ber gen- B else n.  
Bec aus e when t hey li quidat ed Aus chwitz , the y  
wer e tra ns porting everybody, j ust  the  grown- ups .  
And I don't  know how t hos e c hildr e n di d t hat  in 
the movi e, survi ve. 
Q: What  di d you do with 
your da ys, now t hat  you were  s pending
 s o mu c h ti me  in
 the  house?   Di d 
you go out at  all a fter  
the ghett o was l i qui date d?  
A: No, I didn't go out a t  all.  I wa
s really afraid.  And 
I wa s very depr esse d.  And I ha d a garde n a nd 
I grew vegetables and flowers a
nd I reme mber it was ju
st lots of sweet peas, and I still love

gardeni ng to this day but I spend a lot of ti me 
gardeni ng.  It was s pring when the ghett o was  
liqui date d a nd then I , I did a l ot of me ditati ng a nd 
thinking about th
ings.  An d also this friend of 
mi ne tha t  I me ntione d, I r ene , ca me t o visit me s e
veral ti me s wit h her hus band.  And they wer e i n  
busi nes s s m uggling vodka.  What t h
ey wer e  doi ng i s, it was  some thi
ng more than illegal , but this 
was their business.  Th
ey would bring Absolute
 alcohol and bottle it 
and they had the whol e 
para pher nali a, you know, to seal  the  bottl es a nd 
put t he l abel s on and what-not , a nd t here was a  
eating plac e in Wa-gi ve- nee k-a (ph), the onl y one at
 that ti me, a dri nki ng place , and that 's wher e  
they were se lling t he  vodka.  And 
their headquarters were at my  
pl ace .  The y woul d slee p in the  
basement and bottle the vodka for th
ree days and then go back to Wa
rsaw.  They live
d in Warsaw. 
And they us e to bri ng anot
her friend of thei rs wit h 
them.  And he was studyin
g to be a doct or but he 
coul dn't do i t  bec a us e all  t he me dica
l s chools were close d, but he di d 
finish medical  degr ee.  He got  
a me dical degree after t h e war and he was a car di ologis
t .  He wa sn't Je wis h, but he wa s a very good 
friend of Irene and her husband. 
 An d whe n I  we nt to  Kra ko w an
d Warsaw the first time after the 
war , I calle d up.  Fre n -ya-vet-s ki ( ph) was his  
na me, Da do Fre n-ya-vet-ski ( ph) , and his wi fe 
answer ed and said he di ed a year
 ago of a heart at tack.  So, I l o
st anot her friend t hat was from t he 
past, you know.  
And Irene died, I told 
you before, and her hu
sband is still alive, 
and when we go to 
visit , we se e  hi m and s ee  the daught
e r .  But , what  I did wa s I read, I 
love d to rea d.  So I read and I  
studied the English a 
little bit, and I just tried 
to keep busy.  I did some
 artwork and I ended up in  
the St ates he re, whe n I st arted goi ng bac k to sc hool
, I got a M asters De gre e in Ar t.  I t hink I ha d a  
Master s De gree i n Dra ma .  So
 I  ca n ge t busy with t hings
, so that's what I did. 
Q: Was Yannosh still wo
rking at this time?  
A: Well he got into some fi nancial 
troubles.  I don't know
 exactly what wa s.  
And then he lost the 
job.  So he wa sn't working eith
er and he was sit ting a r ound the 
house doing nothin
g.  So, t hings  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
37 
 
 
were kind of sad.  We  were ju
st waiting out time.  Wa iting for th
e war to be ov
er.  Waiting for 
things to cha nge a nd not hing see me d  to be c hangi
ng.  And, I don't know, he
 was i n bl ack mar ket . 
And this is also possible, 
that t hat c ontribut ed t o our be ing arre
sted.  Because they consi dered us as  
political prisoners or whatever
 that was suppose to be. 
Q: What a bout his par ent s a nd hi
s si st er?   Wer e t h ey worki ng?  
A: His father was paralyzed, partia
lly paralyzed.  And he 
spent most of his days
 playing solitaire. 
The grandmother was doing the c ooki ng, whate ver

let us pac k out bel ongings.  We all pa cke d a bi g 
suitcase and a small sui tca
se and we took most of  
our st uff wit h us.  And t hey put us on an open tr uc
k, in the back of the truck.  There were benche s 
on the truc k and we s at on the benc he s wit h the s u itcase s.  And I expect ed t o be ta ken t o the sa me  
station that my father wa
s taken to, which was really
 a cargo station with cattle
 trains.  But they took 
us to the regular train station 
in Krakow.  And I re
member sitting on the ba
ck of the truck and 
looking ba ck and t r yi ng t o re me mber
 and t hinki ng, I 'll ne ver s e e it agai
n.  And the first thing that I 
did wh en we  ca me to Kr ako w , I we
nt to the tr ain station and s t ood 
ther e a nd looked at  the vie w .  I  
saw it again.  Anyway, th
ey put us on a regular train.  Not a 
cattle train, on a regular train in a  
compart ment, the six of us.  A
nd a ft er a while , t he trai n, t he Ger m
a n sol d ier was st anding outsi de 
wit h his gun, but t he y treated us ver y nicel y.  A
nd they had a bunch of pa
pers with them.  Very, 
very care f ull y ha d it folded.  And we  sat a nd wa i t
ed a nd t he t r ain st arte d and we di dn't recogni ze  
really the stations.  We  didn'
t stop.  The first stop was Ausc
hwitz.  An d we knew all about 
Ausc hwitz by then.  You go there a n d you don't c o me 
bac k.  And we wa it ed for the m t o get us out. 
And the train stood there for quite 
a whi l e and then it started and it 
mea nt  we are not goi ng to go t o 
Ausc hwitz.  That  was a  big relie f. 
 And, a s I s ay, we we re all t oge
t her , the whole fa
mil y, i n the one 
comp artment.  An d I don't re me mb er what the fi rst 
stop was, but it wa s some
time in the evening. 
Thi s trai n s t oppe d, the y 
got us out, and sometime s 
they transported us i n a n ope n kind
 of a truck and 
someti me s it  was like a van.  And 
we either we nt, most of t h e ti me
 we went to a pri s on.  And we 
wer e put , you s ee, I ha ve  
not very much of a reco
l l ection.  Wh ether  we we re se par ated or whether  
we were all put into one ro
om with bunks.  I just don't remember.  I just know that we traveled for 
al most  si x weeks .  Ma ybe four 
weeks.  Because we came t o 
Be rgen- B else n someti me  i n May. 
Q: This was May of 1944?

A: 1944.  We ll actuall y, now I re me mber , see  things
 come back.  When we wer e arrested that 
mo rni ng , we  wer e  tak e n t o the Ge
stapo again.  The same prison th
at I was in be fore .  And t he me n 
wer e , t he fat her a nd brot her a nd my hus ba nd wer e  
separate , a nd the four 
wome n wer e toge ther . 
And t he reason t hat  I 
remember is that wh
en we finally got to
 Bergen-Belsen, after seei ng the train 
station a nd the pris on, a coupl e 
o f  ti mes we  wer e  in a c a mp.  
 An d I don't know, if it wa s 
Ra vensbr uc k or some  ot her ca mp, jus t  for overni ght.
  And then they
 took us bac k on t he tr ain and 
back until we got to Bergen-Belse
n.  And they let us have our su

mber I had two  
fa vor ite dre s ses.  And I notice d

Q: Can you backtrack just a 
little bit to the beginning? 
A: Yes.  When we got to Ber gen
- B elsen, I  opened the sui t cases an
d I  found out  that hal f  of my 
things tha t  I had pa cke d  in Kra kow wer e mi ssi ng. 
 And I fi gure d out that 
when t he y took us out 
fr om that room, it was a large, la
r ge room wit h ma ny wome n in it , th
at they thought 
that we won't 
come ba ck.  And t he y j u
st took stuff from our
 suit cases.  And 
then the Ger mans came and got t h e 
suitca ses and br ought t h e m t o us. 
 So I fi gur ed out that
 the y must ha ve  stole n the m  then.  But  
anywa y, all our belongi ngs ot her wi se  wer e ther e.  
And we ar ri ved i n Ber ge n
-Belse n a nd, as you ca n 
see from the book, we were 
registered all right, th
e whole family.  An
d we were treated
 quite well. 
We got three meals a 
da y.  The y wer en't anythi ng
 fa nc y.  We  had a sa ndwi
ch for lunch and c o ffe e  
and a piece of bread in the mornin
g, but sometime s it was with marg
arine.  And soup with a little bit 
of me at in it, but lots of 
potatoes.  And you could get 
t w o bowl s i f you want ed t o. 
Q: And you were still with
 all of your friends? 
A: And still with the famil
y.  And we all slept in 
the same room.  It was 
a long room with bunk  
beds.  It was n 't  thos e shel ves li ke
 you see in Ausc
hwitz.  They were just, you
 were like in a summer 
ca mp.  Rea l l y.  It was  cle an a nd it 
wa s nic e a nd t h e mattre sse s wer e qu
ite good.  It wa
sn't just str a w 
and a blanket.  And we  did get 
bl a nket s, I don't re me mber havi ng
 linens, but I th
ink there were 
blankets .  M aybe the r e were s o me 
r o ugh sheets.  But  anyway, the wo
rk t h at we di d, t h e first week 
we  di dn't do anyt hing and the n I  
think in a sewing room
 somew here.  And t hat 's where I  lear ned to 
se w.  Well  I did know how t o s e
w b ut  not  as  well as I 
know now.  Anyway, I 
was  se wi n g  
things and 
I don't remember what they
 were and most of the ti
me there it was just day 
by day.  It was killing  
ti me .  Ther e  were a lot of pe opl
e fr om Holland there al ready and es
peci ally the diamond cutt er s. 
Because I  remember  that  they were
 r e ally bei ng tr eated 
very well because t hey 
c oul dn't do any dirty

work be caus e their ha nds  would get i n sensi tive t o th
e fine tools wit h the dia monds and s o this whole 
time  in Bergen-Belsen, it
's sort of a blank.  I 
do n 't reall y r e me mb er mu c h
, the fi rst ti me we were 
there.  Except that we were treated
 quite well.  That it was fairly cl
ean.  That ther e wer e bathr ooms, 
latrines you might say, but there wa
s running water.  The fa ucets with
 wat er and we  could wash up.  
And I t hink t here wer e even shower
s.  An d I know that we could we
ar our own clot hes .  And t here 
wa s a la undr y we c oul d wa sh t hings
 in.  And t he n in August , all of
 a sudden, we wer e gat hered up 
and we were  told t o pa ck up our s uitc ases a nd that 's
 when we wer e put ba c k on a truck and t ake n t o  
the train station an
d put in a cattle wa
gon.  And straw. 
Q: Befo re we go on, I realized that we skip
ped over a little bit about th
e Ger man invasion of 
Hungary a nd how you're  l ife  c hange d af
t er t hat , while you wer e in Kra kow. 
A: That 's when, well , oka y, now in
 Kr akow, you s ee, I ki
nd of don't re me mber the deta i l s.  I know 
that t hey couldn't pur chase anymore things i n t h e 
_____________ st ore.  Th
at we were selling al l 
the je welry t hat we ha d.  That Ch
e s- wa p (ph) wa s bri ngi ng me mone
y and that things
 weren't very 
good.  And t hen, you see  I 
di dn't go anywher e.  I  was a fraid to 
l eave the house, I stayed i n t he house 
most of the time, all the time, exce
pt when my fr iend came to visit 
I mi ght have gone to the village 
wit h her .  Ir ene fr om Warsaw. 
 And then, you s ee I don't r e me mb
er t he dates when actuall y the 
inva sion ha ppened.  And I would have to look it up
 I suppose.  And what caused the arr est, I again  
will never know.  Wh ether 
they decided that we were not the pr
otected Hungarian c
itizens, that we 
wer e just Hungari an Je ws .  But ther e must ha ve 
b een so me thi ng more t o 
it because then we would  
have been transported as 
Hungarian Jews.  But we 
were treated as political 
prisoners.  We  had the 
papers.  And as I say, at first we were sort of 
interned in Bergen-Belsen 
and then we were still 
treated as pri soners because the tr
ansport was very small 
and of the things that happened when we 
arrive d in the ca mp.  Tha t
 we were tat t ooe d with t he se rial numb
er of the prisoner
s a n d not just, you

know like the Pr uss i a pe ople  for ex
a mple, ha d a n A dash and s o me
 number.  We  ha d the ser i a l  
number of t his parti cula r  gr oup 
of prisoners .  M i ne wa s ________
____, I ha ve t he  vial with th e  
number and it was 81000 with
 the triangle, and the tria
ngle is still 
on my arm.  
Q: I n Berge n-Belse n, you start ed 
working in the sewing room soon
 after you arrived, or how long 
did it t ake  be fore you ha d start ed?  
A: It see ms to me that I  didn't do a nyt hing fo
r at least a couple of week
s.  Ma ybe more, I don't 
know.  It j us t , t hat whol e  peri od 
is  just very, very va gue
.  I know I got  ver y fr
ie ndl y wi th Bet sy.  I  
did not have mu ch contact with my  hus
ba nd, de fi ni tely no inti mate c ont act . 
Q: Tel l  me  a bout how you me
t  Bets y and would you just  s a
y her fu ll name, for the tape? 
A: Ho w I  me t B e ts y?  

Q: How you met Bet sy a nd i f you 
woul d just say her full na me for 
the t ape beca use I don't think 
we 've  me nti one d her .  

A: Bets y Gordon.  I  mea n, I kne w he r as  Bets y Gord
on.  And I met her  when 
we  arri ve d i n Ber ge n-
Belsen, on the transport.  Either
 she was already there 
or we picked t he m  
up i n s o me  ca mp, the  
other Hungarian citizens.  There 
were, Betsy was the onl
y woman and the rest 
were men.  And they 
wer e sort of mi ddle-a ge d me n and Bet sy was It
alian, I me a n, Bets y wa s Hungaria n dance r  who  
lived in Italy and s he had dye d, aubur
n-red hair all the way to her wais
tline.  Very beautiful woman. 
And s he s poke fluent It a lian.  Sh
e spoke some Ger man and, of 
cours e, Hungaria n.  And s he wa s  
bor n in Budapest but she  lived i n
 Ital y.  And her full na me  wa s E
liz abet h Gordon.  
But she wa nted 
to be call ed Bet sy.  That 's all 
I know about Betsy.  A
nd I  was wit h he r the en
tire t i me, f rom the day 
we were, our heads were shaved 
until the day we left , I me an, un
til I left Bergen-Belsen, the camp, 
with my  cousin. 

Q: What a bout t he r est  of your hus ba nd'
s fa mily?  We re you still with them?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

A: All right .   The fat her  had t o ha ve  his nitr ogl
ycerin, whic h he di dn't ha

about two weeks a ft er we arrive d in ca mp, in Auschwitz .  He  was doing oka y in Ber gen- B else n.  
We had the medicine for 
him and he had 
angina ________
__ in addition to the st
roke and he had to 
have nitr ogl yceri n.  And it see ms to me t hat he 
got it from the Germans, 
t he medicati o n, when we  
wer e in Bergen- Bels en.  Bec ause he did get , he 
had t he drops that you pu
t on t he t ongue, you know ,  
when you woul d get  choked
 up.  And I thi nk he ha
d some  pi lls.  Ot her wi s
e, nobody e l se di d a ny  
me dicat ion but whe n we arrive d in
 Ausc hwitz, I  know that
 Ya nnos h ca me a nd t old us that fat he r  
died.  And Ya nnos h, I don't know 
whether he ha d t uber cul osi s of th
e bone whe n he  was a  c hild or  
wa s it  a birt h de fect , I j u st don't 
re me mb er w hat  it  w a s,  b ut he  had  
a de for me d hip.  He was  a ver y 
handsome guy, he da nce d and e ver yt hing, the le g di
dn't bot he r hi m.  But he
 did li mp.  But still he 

coul d get ar ound a nd he wa s not put i n the  ga s ch
a mber , you know, at t h
e begi nni ng when, I me a n , 
aft e r we wer e  resc ue d from t he gas cha mber he wa
s put  in t he c a mp.  And I sa w hi m several ti me s ,  
he ca me to visit be cause  some of the  men c oul d 
come int o the camp wi th
 some erra nds and the y  
would bring food or t h ey woul
d bring s o mething and he woul
d s nea k out a nd s a y hell o or,  
someti me s, he could e ve n come t o 
the fe nce.  And the only thing I 
know a bout hi m is t hat whe n we  
wer e  in Pari s , whe n I was  in Pa ris wit h Vi cki e , 
tr ying t o get t he  exit vi sa, and ther e were ma ny other  
people from all over Germany and 
t h ere were several people from 
Auschwitz, s eve ral me n.  And I  
wa nte d to know i f they kne w be ca us e he wa sn't ju
st like one of the prisoner
s, he re all y had very 
___________ distinct limp and he was a little bit different. 
 And they knew him. 
 And they said that 
one day the r e was a sel ec tion and he wa s select ed out
.  And they ne ver sa w hi m again.  So I ass u me  
that he was gass ed and done wit h. 
 And t hen the mother , t he sister, 
Betsy and I were together all the  
ti me , e xce pt  for t he shor t ti me wh
en I was very il l and 
I was in the hospital. 
 An d t hen  the y were  
goi ng to have a selecti on in the hospi t al and the nu
rse s got me  out the day be for e bec ause the y said  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

that the hospital was going to be
 liquidated.  So  whomever they
 c oul d get out .  Wha t  was wr ong  
wit h me is that I got so me  kind of
 an i n fant ago infectio
n, or whatever it wa s , on my l egs .  And I had 
sores all the way to the 
bone , oozing, and t hen it 
was ____________.  
It was  a big mes s a nd my le gs  
were extremely swollen.  But still they
 said I have to be able to wa
lk out of there because otherwise  
I will be fi nished.  And th
ey put some ba
ndages on my legs and they got 
me  out.  And then I still 
had t o go on the roll call  ever y mor n
ing, get up.  But I was able to
 walk and I was able to go to 
work.  And so that 's how I sur viv
ed that ordeal.  But i f you l ook 
cl osely you c an still  see the spot s 
on my l egs.  For year s a nd yea r s I  had big bl otc hes
.  And mother , j ust  before , i n De ce mber , j us t  
be for e  the ca mp wa s eva c uate d we ha d anot her s e l
ection and they se parate d 
there with us  and Doot-

to go with her and they separated them and the 
mother  was put  in what  t hey call  
Schul- Ne wtz  (ph) bloc k,
 which wa s pres ervati
on bl oc k, and al l t he  
old and we a k wome n we re put t here .
  And we went to visit her a co
uple of times and she said she 
kne w tha t  t h ey we re goi ng to be  
jus t ga sse d bec ause  they couldn't ,
 t hey had the wor k a nd they 
couldn't do a
nything.  She was extr
emely emaciated and sh
e was getting really 
weaker and weaker 
and one day we  went to see her a
nd t he bl oc k wa s e mpt y.  They took
 them all out. 
 And Doot- si e 
(ph) wa s ver y, very clos e  to her 
mother and I thi n k that r eall y sh
ocke d her terribl y and she cri ed a n d 
cried for da ys and we c ouldn't do a
nyt hing.  And s he got te rribl y ski nny in t he last c oupl e of we eks .  
Bet sy a nd I wer e prett y skinny t oo, but nothi ng lik
e Doot-sie (ph) was just started to look like a 

skelet on.  And t hen whe n the y s el
ect ed us again, they selected me
 and Bets y for t h
e t r ai n and Doot -

e 29th of Dece mber and I don't ha
ve the date wh en the Russians 
ca me t o Aus chwitz .  But  
I am sure it is dated. 
Q: But be for e we go on . . . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
45 
 
 
A: Doot-s ie (ph) sur vive d.  Bec a
use you as ked me what happene d to 
the rest of the family.  So it 
wa s just Bet sy a nd I  wer e take n t o Berge n- Bels e n an
d Doot-s ie (ph) sta ye d 
in Auschwitz.  And then 
I under sta nd that she wa s rescued by the Russia n s. 
 And whe n we  watc he d 
t he movi e, it s ee ms  to 
me , one of the m l ooke d like Doot -sie (ph) , one of the wome n that was being taken by the  nuns , yo u 
know.  But then when we got in
 t o uch wit h Re nya Chich- e n-ska 
(ph) whos e hous e they t aught 
Englis h, I got an exact re port on what  happene d.  
Doot-si e (ph) was res cue d by the Rus sians .  Sh e  
stayed in Auschwitz in 
whatever camp they had 
them until they evacuated 
them, and then she came  
bac k to Kra kow.  And s he ca me to
 the Deit-chin-ski (ph) house a
nd she stayed with them for six  
mont hs.  She also ha d t hese s ores on her legs. 
 But t hey got  her cure d.  And some thi ng horribl e  
happe ned to Doot-si e ( ph).  She  go
t a job with the jo
int, United joint, what wa
s it?   The Je wish Joint  
Institution, it wa
s wor king in Kr akow. 
 An d Rayna (ph) did not know 
why, but t here wa s some  ki nd  
of i mproprie ties in the J oint .  By the n the 
Communist governme nt was,
 t ook over Kr akow.  An d 
Doot-si e (ph) wa s arre ste d by t he Communi sts a n d 
put i n pris on for eight ye
ars.  She wa s in prison 
for eight years.  Since 1
954 or so until 1962.  An
d then she was re
leased and 
went to Budapest . 
Now t her e was a cousi n of t heirs 
i n St ockhol m.  The fa mil y, t h ey 
were fi rst  cousin
s, and the Uncle 
and Aunt I  s uppos e and t he young 
cousin, i m mi gr ated t o Stoc khol m 
and he ca me t o Kr akow, or he  
ca me and took her to Budapest.  And he ca me to 
visit her several times.  I got it all fr om Deitch-

chin- ski ( ph)  and fro m t h e cousin fr om Stoc khol m,
 he wrot e  me a lett er.  
That Doot- sie (ph) got  
married and her husband died after three years.  
And then she got a stoke 
and she was very ill for 
quite  s o me t i me , para lyz ed, and sh
e  died in Budapest  in
 1982.  But  s he did su
r vive t he war  but i t  
was very, very sad, what happened
 to her.  So that's
 what happened to 
the Fanyo (
ph) fa mily. 
Q: Okay, we're continuing

I wondere d i f you could say ho

A: Well it seems to me th
at Be tsy, now I don't reme mb er whethe

she arri ved later or she was already there.  Beca
use we wer e toget her with the ot her  Hungari an  
people .  And eve n though s he ca me  from It aly a nd s he live d  in Italy and she was a dancer , I don't

but I know that she looked like an
 ac tress with lots of ma ke-up 
and the dyed hair.  And s he was ver y bea uti ful .  A
nd she was t here .  It see ms t o me like she alre ady 
was there.  That she was 
deported just like 
we were, as a Hungarian citiz
en living abroa
d.  Living in 
a country that was occupi ed or in some way connec
ted with Germany.  And we
 were all in the same 
barra ck.  And the barra c ks were ve
ry clean, the y wer e ver y well ke
pt.  And we sle pt i n bunk beds 
whi c h wer e  j ust re gula r  bunk be
nds , you know, lower bu nk a n d upper bunk.  
And the older pe ople  
slept i n t he lower bunks and the 
younger sl ept i n the  upper  bunks
.  And I don't quite reme mb er 
whether, I know we ha d blankets .  I don't think we  
had line ns a s suc h.  I can't re me mber, I just don't  
re me mb er.  But I kn o w th
ere wer e mattresses, there wasn't just
 a boar d wit h maybe s o me s t ra w or  
maybe just a thin blanket.  But 
there wer e , t he y mi ght ha ve bee n 
str aw matt resses, whi ch are very 
popular in Europe, or they
 might have 
been just some kind 
of things, sacks fille
d up with whatever 
filling they had.  And an
yway, they were not as 
bad as we had come la
ter in Auschwitz.  And

ever ythi ng wa s very cle a
n.  We  had to clea n it  ours elves bu
t ther e wer e  br ooms and ther e wer e  
cleani ng supplies and there was a wa
sh room and a bathroom with ru
nni ng water .  
So the things 
weren't really, it was not as primitiv
e as some other camps.  And I k
now that at first we didn't do  
anyt hing a nd it wa s rather  bori ng.  And ther e were 
a lot of people fr om Ho
l l and, I thi nk I  me ntione d 
that, diamond cutt ers.  And they
 defi nitely would not work in 
a nyt hing.  The y were ki nd of 
shelte red bec ause t heir ha nds c oul d not get ruined 
because t hey wouldn't be 
able to do the precision 
work evi dently t hat 's r equired of 
a  di a mond cutte r.  So t he y were mo
re sheltered.  An
d I don't really  
remember exactl y what we
 were  d oi ng an d what  we  were  se wi
ng, but  it se e med it wa s n 't  on s e wing 
machi nes.  I t seems t o 
me  that we  wer e  re pairi ng t hi ngs , ma
ybe they were uni fo
r ms , ma ybe  the y 
wer e just thi ngs fr om t he  ca mp.  I jus t  don't re me
mber.  But I  know that we 
didn't just sit idly the  
whole ti me .  And a gain we ha d 
thr ee meals a day, I me an ther
e were  no scra mbl ed eggs for  
breakfast , there was just maybe a 
pie ce of bre ad wit h some margar
i ne a nd coffe e, whic h wa s us uall y 
kind of brown wat er but a t  least it was sweete ned w
ith sacc hari ne I suppose .  And the n for  lunch we  
had s andwic hes a nd a gai n coffee.  And in t he e v
ening there was some ki
nd of soup wit h maybe 
some me at a nd l ots of po
tatoes  and ve geta bles .  And we  were n't 
hungry.  As a matter
 of fact, I, you 
know, we coul d get sec onds on s oup.  It was very 
sur prisi ng t o us t hat  
that was a concentratio n 
ca mp a nd we wer e  we ari ng our own 
clothes.  All the suit
cases came wit h us a
nd we ha d the m right 
in the barr a ck.  And s o  we could c hange and that
's when I  discovered that our suit cases wer e  
pilfered, still in Kra
kow, because a lot of th
ings were missing. 
Q: How mu ch did you 
know, or what did yo
u know, about the co
ncentration camps?  
A: We rea l l y didn't know ver y muc h.  The onl y 
cont act with a pers on th
at actuall y was in a 
concentr ation camp was Ye
s-cho Mo-stof- ski (ph)  wh
o was  the young man, the older  br other  of th e  
two s ons of _________ Mo-st o f-s k
i (ph) .  And he was  arre ste d ve
ry shortly after the Germans came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

in.  And, as  I found out  now fr
om his brot her and fr om Yesh-i f 
( ph) a nd we visit e d the m l ast  
summer , t hat  he wa s involv
ed in Boy Scouts  and he was higher  ra
nking offi cial in the  or gani zation.  
And he was arreste d.  And I think in
 1940, as early as that
, and sent t o Ausc hwi t z.
  And at that time, 
we real ly di dn't know what Auschwi t z was except 
that they were sending pe
ople there.  And also 
the uni versit y pr ofessor s wer e arrested and sent t o
 Auschwitz.  Now we rarely
 didn't hear from him,  
and then he came back a
bout eight months later, a
nd as I say the dates, I don'
t know exactly.  I know 
that he has stacks of book
s of hi s me moirs le ft be cause he showe d
 them to us and they were all in 
Poli sh a nd I  said I woul d love t o re ad the m a nd 
translate them into Englis
h so t hat people kne w  
what was going on.  
Because one of t he thi ngs that he tol d 
us last Summer, or 
maybe I should just  
say what ha ppe ne d whe n Yes h-e (ph) ca me  bac
k, and I don't re me mbe r , 
it was  1940 or 1941.  I  
know it was at the very beginning. 
 And two years was still the begi
nning.  And he came back and 
he was really in seclusion.  And it was, I was still 
very young then and I real
ly didn't know what was 
goi ng on.
  
But the thing that I remember was that Ye
sh- e (ph) would not talk to anybody a bout  
things.  Wha t  ha ppe ne d t o hi m.  
Wha t  he was doi ng.  Why he  wa s le
t  go.  And he j u
st  wouldn't sa y 
anything of wh at happened to hi
m i n  the concent r ation camp.  Bu
t t he n when Rober t  and I were  
visiting them last summer, Yesh-e (ph) showed us 
his me moir s and als o he  was an a ma t eur pai nter ,  
well he thought of hi mself more th
an an amateur, but anyway, the wall s of his apart me nt wer e just  
filled with paintings.  An
d some of the painti ngs wer e de picti
ng hi s life in Aus chw
itz, in the white 
and bl ue uni for ms and t h e thi ng that
 he told us was abou
t Father Colbert who wa
s sancti fied by t h e  
Pope a nd we  happe n to be on an ex
cursion in Italy with 
our uni versit y and we stayed i n a monaster y 
which was converted into a hotel. 
 And i t  was  na me d a f ter Fa ther Co
lbert.  And also , at that ti me, 
the Pope sancti fied hi m, t hat ye
ar, he wa s some 82 or so, a nd I 
know t hat e v erybody was  extre mel y 
respe ct ful of Fat her Col be r t beca us e we ha d some  
r unar ound wi th some  Ital
i an police .  And beca use  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

of, I thi nk it wa s somet hi ng about 
t he ticket s on the bus , but a n yway 
they wanted to know where we 
wer e  sta yin g  and we s a id that we 
were stayi ng in t h e Cas
tle Colbert.  And they
 were very i mpressed  
and let us go. 
[End  of Si de A of Tape 3] 
Q: Mrs . Wa re, could you 
start fr om the beginning of you're 
s ente nce  and you were  tal king a bout  
Father Colbert? 
A: Yes.  Father Colbert was a Cath
ol ic pri est i n Poland 
and he was arrest ed like 
all the other priests, 
well ma ny ot her prie sts , a nd se nt to Ausc hwitz.  And 
he was there at the same ti me t hat  Yesh-e Mo-
stof-s ki ( ph)  was t her e.  And Ye
s h-e (ph) wit nes s ed hi s execution a
nd he had it depict ed in one of 
his pa inti ngs  and he told us about t he tortur es that
 Fat her Col be r t we nt thr ough just be ca use he wa s  
a Catholic priest.  Ther
e  wa s no ot her  reas on.  He  had no other sins . 
Q: So fr om the stories th
at you heard fr om Yesh- e
 (ph) , you didn't have t he i mpr essi on that t her e  
wa s a mass exterminati
on of Je ws  goi ng on?  
A: No, you see, all that we got la
st Summer but when Yes h-e ( ph) 
ca me ba ck, when he wa s releas ed 
fr om Ausc hwitz , he mus t  ha ve bee n
 told the same thing that we we
re t old when you ha ve not see n  
or you haven't heard anything.  He 
was forbidden, he was le
t go on the basis that
 he is not going to 
talk about what he saw or what 
happene d to hi m in the conce ntrat
i on c a mp.  And eve n hi s closest  
fa mi ly, a ccording t o his  
br other  to whom we t alke d re cent l y,
 he  sai d nobody eve r  kne w what  
happe ned to Yes h-e (ph)  during the six or ei ght 
mont hs that he was a wa y.  And als o  he doe sn't  
know why t hey let hi m go ex
cept  that maybe they needed t he sp
ace for  somebody else t hat they 
wa nted to do in.  So we 
j ust knew that ther e was a place t hat pe
opl e di dn't wa nt t o tal k about.  But  
we  ha d absol utely no i dea  what  act uall y wa s goi
ng on in Aus chwitz  or  
in a n y of t he ca mps. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

Q: So whe n  you were i n Ber ge n- Be l sen, did you 
have any fe ars or e xpect
ations of what might  
happen? 
A: No we di dn't.  J ust be caus e, 
we heard that the concentr ation 
ca mps wer e ca mps where the y put 
the people t here and t hey were su
ppose to be working and we just 
had gl i mpse s of it , but  here we 
were in a so-called concentrati
on ca mp and it wa s not hing like anyb
ody would have t hought.  That  
it wa s bad, that t here were star vi ng people or, 
we we ren't beate n, we wer en't, on the c ontr ary, 

everybody was quite polite and quite
 nice to us.  And I don't know, 
is it because the type of camp 
they were runni ng at t hat
 ti me was a, sort of a 
hol ding c a mp for people  that
 they want ed t o use for  
some ot her pur pos es or whate ver. 
 And it was very, ver y s t range 
when I, later on when I tol d 

some body t h at I was i n Ber ge n- Bels en be for e, t h ey ju
st c oul dn't be lieve that 
it wasn't as bad as it 
wa s when we were t here  later.  And on the wa y t o
 Ber ge n- Be l sen as I tol d you be fore , we woul d 
stop in pri sons.  But a 
couple of time s we did stop
 in  s o me co nce ntrati on c a mps .  I  d on ' t re me mb er  
the names, but I know that they 
we re ca mps bec ause we were put in
 a barr ack, but a gai n, they wer e  
bunk be ds , t hey were , maybe t hese  
wer e spaces that t hey were re
servi ng for t e mporary guests, o r  
something like that.  But not  for the actual inmate
s because we reall y, on 
all these excursions we 
never saw what we saw later. 

Q: Whe n you were  in Be rgen- B else
n in the mi ddl e of 1944
, di d you he ar a ny ne ws  of t he war?   Di d 
you know where the 
Ru ssian front was? 
A: No .  We nev e r k ne w wh at wa
s going out on t he outsi de world. 
 We ha d, t here wer e  no r a di os , 
there  were  no ne ws  whatsoe ver . 
 We  hear d t he _____
_____ in Ausc hwi tz 
because t here wer e 
radios, t here wer e contact s but i n 
Bergen-Belsen it was just
 li ke a, sort of poor man's resort al most ,  
compared wi th what 
was goi ng on lat e r. 
Q: Were you in a separate
 barr ac k fr om the  me n?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
51 
 
 
A: No.   The  wh ole  fa mil y was  to ge
ther.  And Betsy was with us and 
then t he other men that  were in 
the same transport.  We were a
ll i n t he sa me  pl a ce.  And t he  onl
y pri vac y you would have is, you 
know, we were on the bunk beds so, 
I  think ther e was even el ectric lig
hting there.  As I recall .  You 
see, some of these t hings are ver
y, ve ry va gue be c ause a lot of the m 
I was trying to sort of forget, 
but I just don't reme mb er.  I just
 know that definitely we  were
, the family wa s all together. 
Q: Tel l  me  a bout t he de
portation to Auschwitz. 
A: As I s a id ,  we wer e  liv ing d a y 
by day and it se e me d to be ra ther 
boring.  And then one be auti ful  
morning they walked in and they 
were quite different in
 atti tude , t he sol diers  or  the  guards or  
whoe ver the y were , t he y  were i n uni f or m.  I  gues s th
ey were  all SS me n.  And they told us to pack 
and al so t o hurr y.  Ever ythi ng fr om then on wa s  to
 hur ry.  And s o we pa cke d and the y brought a  
truck a nd t h ey loa de d us  all on the tr uck wit h all 
of our s uitc a ses.  And tra nsporte d us t o the trai n 
station.  And the n we di dn't feel
 so good a nymo r e bec aus e it  wa sn
't a passenger 's tr ai n, it was the 
regul ar wa gon train.  And t hey pu
t us all in one wagon 
and there was just stra
w on the floor.  And 
we were given little packet
s of sandwiches.  And th
ese were like sliced br
ead with some kind of a  
paste in between, a paste 
a little bit like meat past
e or whatever, but anyway 
they were edible, they 
were quite edible.  And there wa
s a bucket i n  the cor ner I gu
ess for sanita tion.  And I don't  
remember getting any water 
in addition but I re
member the sandwich
es.  And then we rode the train 
wit h the soldiers at one end and we were at the ot
her end.  An d as I say, 
I don't re me mber  how ma ny  
of us were, there might ha
ve bee n fe wer  tha n t w enty pe ople.  
And t here wer e si x of us a nd Bets y 
and t hen t her e wer e sever al me n.  So t here mi ght ha
ve been fi ft een, there mi
ght have bee n more , bu t  
less than twenty. 
Q: Were  the y all  Hungari an?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
52 
 
 
A: They wer e all Hungar i an citi zens 
who di dn't li ve in Hunga r y.  The y
 all  lived i n di ff erent places.  
Just like we lived in Po
land, Betsy in Italy, 
a nd t hose pe ople  might have been i n Roma nia ,  
Cze chosl ova kia, a nd I don't think th
er e wer e any from Poland
.  I don't reca l l .  But I know that the y  
were all Hungarian citizens.  Now 
I don't rememb er how lo
ng the journey lasted.  
I know we slept. 
I know we got more food so it migh
t have bee n t wo da ys, it mi ght ha
ve been two-and-a-half days, I 
don't re me mber.  And then the y ne ve
r let us out .  We had t o go to the bathroom in t he buc ket in t he 
corner.  But there was a bucket .  
And I don't re me mber whet he r they had us  carry out and e mpt y the  
buc ket , whet her the trai n stoppe d, I just don't re me
mber.  It see ms to me 
that ma ybe it was on the  
wa y t o Ausc hwi t z or ma ybe  it was on t he way ba
ck t o Bergen-Bel sen. 
 But I don't reme mb er. 
Q: Wo uld you say that that was a 
point that  whi ch you c oul dn't reta
in the s a me  di gni ty a ny longer?  
A: No.   At  t hat poi nt i t  wa s, well 
just the fact that we 
didn't  have  pri vac y t o go
 to the bathroom was  
already something that wa
s very humili ating.  And pr oba bly this
 was somet hing that , well , I don't  
know whether I want to talk abou
t it.  But I still am 
having problems, you kno
w?  I mean, when I 
travel, I have problems.  But this
 wa s the t a ste o f  wh at we we re 
goi ng to go thr ough pr oba bly and 
we were scared.  We were scared 
because all  of a sudden
 we  we re not t r e ated 
nicely.  The soldiers 
wer e shouti n g at us and the gra ndmot her was not 
very well a n d they wer e shouting at her be cause  
she was moaning and they
 yelle d that we shoul d kee p her qui
et a nd we were alr ea dy ha ving a  
premonition of what was waiting. 
Q: And then you ar
r i ve d i n Ausc hwitz ? 
A: Then we arrived in Auschwitz 
and we were told to gat her up our bel ongings and ge t out and we  
had t o c arry the m out .  And t he gra ndmother  sti ll co
uld s ort  of wal k, I me an wit h help, so it  wa s  

very di ffi cult  beca us e at t hat poi n
t we didn't carry about 
the suitcases but we wa
nted to help her and  
we had to help the father to getout of the train and they were shout
ing, they wo uldn't 
let us leave the  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
53 
 
 
suitcases in the train.  We had to
 car r y the m o ut.  And wh en we a
rrived at the station, things you 
know ar e pr etty, I ki nd of trie d t o
 pus h t he m out  of my mind, you 
know, and not reme
mber.  But as 
I recall, t he first place we stoppe
d wa s  some ki nd of a n offic e  wher
e they tatt ooe d us a nd they e ve n  
tattooed the grandmothe
r.  And they tattooe
d, you had to hold the ar m s
till and it seem
s to me like it 
was one of t he Jewish worker s t hat
 wa s assigne d to do 
t hat.  And she, and I 
think I pulled my ar m 
beca use  s he stuc k t he ne e dle, a nd the n  she, th
e r e it  is, she  st uc k the pe n ri ght  int o me . 
Q: Into the end of you're fi nger? 
A: At  the end of my finge
r, I  mea n, s he deci ded t o tes t  her pe
n on me .  And t he n s he tattooed me  
and it wasn't very painful.
  It  was  stic king some
 needles into somebody. 
Q: Wh at wa s you're numb er? 

A: M y number, I don't r e me mbe r , but it was s o me
t hing like  81 or 86, 87, 
it was 81,000 or 86,000, 
but  it wa s i n thousa nds .  And I  s aw number s t hat  wa s 
li ke 4, I me an I t hink 
Yesh-e ( ph)  number was  
somet hing li ke 800 or s o met hing 
like that, and Father 
Col bert wa s 1,000, s o 
there wer e  quite , and 
then also there were di ffer ent , I t hi nk t here we
re di fferent  desi gnat i ons  of the numbers .  The n 
depending on what group you belonged
 t o.  So I don't t hink t hat i f 
we ha d 86,000, I don't thi nk t h at 
they onl y ha d 86,000 pe ople i n that ca mp beca us e 
it looked to me like th
ere were many mor e than 
that, but, you know, you can't te
ll out of the mass of people ho
w many actuall y there are.  And  
things we nt very fast fr om t her
e on.  And I just can't exactly re
me mbe r  the  seq uen
ce, but I know I 
can rememb er certain highli
ghts of that whole trip.  
That we still had our jewelr
y, no, that's right. 
We had the suitcases 
a nd we we re all dres sed up a nd t hen we ha
d to carry t he suitcases t o a di fferent  
place where there was, and 
to this day I will never fo
rget the sight of it, ther
e was a, sort of a small 
buil ding a nd there was a big bas ket , j ust hea ped with 
gold.  And the y wa nte d us
 to take off our rings  
and just throw it on the 
heap.  And I had pierced ea
rs, I had ea r r ings , and I  wa
s havi ng t rouble t o get

it out and one of the soldiers
 wa s alr ea dy gra bbi ng my 
ea r a nd I  said, " I  ca n t ake
 it out, leave it", and 
I wa s abl e to undo the ear ring a nd t hr o w it on t he pile
, s o tha t 's t he only j e we lry I ha d.  I t hink Doot-
sie (ph) had earrings , Bet sy had e arri ngs , all wo
men had all these earri ng
s and, a nyway, Ya nnick  
(ph) put his band, anywa y, all  of
 our we ddi ng ba nds a nd ri ngs and j e
welr y wa s thr o wn 
on t hat pile.  
And t he n we  were put  in sort of 
a r o w, wal king, and carry
i ng the suitcases we ha
d t o wa l k.  So eac h  
of us carri ed other  sui tcases beca
use t he gr andmot her had t o be  help
ed.  And we kind of dragge d h e r  
along.  Now we walked on a roa d 
that wa s quit e e mpty a nd it  was not pa ved and ther e  were fiel ds  
on both sides of the road.  And we walked, 
I don't know how muc
h, until the grandmother 
colla pse d.  And she coul d not move a n d one of t he 
soldi ers wal ked up and pulled out a gun and was  
goi ng to s hoot her .  Now we all scr ea me d and crie d 
and we sai d, " we wi ll carry her " , and we trie d t o  
carry her , and then there 
wa s another SS ma n, I s u ppose t hey wer e
 all SS men, that's 
wh at we ca ll ed  
the m, ha d this bunc h of papers .  Evi de ntly t hes e we
re th e pa per s wit h wh ich  we arriv e d s o we were  
all regist ered.  And I coul dn't 
underst a nd exactly what the y we r e argui ng a b out but evi d ently there 
was something about the fa
ct that they couldn't shoot her beca
use s he wa s, they ha d the  doc ume n t s  
on her.  And then, again, 
I don't quite reme mb er wh ether somebo
dy on a  motorc yc
l e we nt by and 
they mi ght have tol d hi m 
to send a truck for us.  
Or, I don't know how it happ
ened that they di d send 
a truck for us.  And one of the op
e n bed truc ks , I  mean, no c over , 
and they helped 
us  on the  truck 
and we dra g ged t he gr andmot her on and s he wa s lyin
g on t he fl oor .  And a t  that point I ,  there were  
benche s on e ach side  too, at that poi nt , s hould I  tel l
 you?   Well , it 's not , but  who's goi ng to re ad it?  
You st op Robert, plea se.  
Please?  Use Kot ex pad on 
the fl oor of the truck. 
 Actually two of them,  
and nobody loos es Kot e x pa ds .  An
d that was t he first i ncli nation 
I had that something wa s very, 
very wrong.  You di dn't  r ecall that , di

the t wo Kot ex pa ds.  What  di d 
you t hink it  i ndic ated?  

A: We ll that indicated to me that 
there was something wrong.  That, 
we knew a little bit about the, it  
wa s call ed i n Polis h 'wa - pon-ka ' ( ph), tha t  mea n s 
'ca t chi ng', catchi ng pe ople.  And we kne w that  
they di d catc h people , the y put the m on the truc ks
 and dr ove the m a wa y, a n
d they wer e rounde d up 
and s o I thought, well , I th
ink that 's t he end of the people be i ng nic e to us .  That s o me thing is ver y, 
very wrong.  And it was sort of a,
 not  onl y a pre m oniti on but r eally 
we r eal ized that  thi ngs are not  
goi ng to be  good.  
So that  was my first  indicat
ion that something was wrong. 
Q: Where di d t he tr uc k t a ke you?  

A: The truc k took us t o Bir kenau 
and the y brought us to, a ga in, I 
tried to fi nd the place when we 
were in Auschwitz, to kn
ow exa ctly wher e we c a me.  I know we ca me through the gate and w e  
came to near the cr emat oria.  B
ecause there is anot her t hing that 
happe n ed.  That 's l ater, bec ause 
first what happened to us
, the suitcases were still with us on 
the truck and the grandmother was on  
the tr uck.  And t he n whe n we got 
off, they told us that
 we di dn't have  to get t he s uitc ases off an d 
they just took us to this one 
room and there was quite a co mmo
tion, that we were del i vere d on a  
truck and the r e wa s thi s half-de ad gra ndmother .  An

shot  a nd she  just  di ed, just like t hat.  And the n 
t here  was shouti ng going on  a nd we really di dn't  
know what  wa s going on.  
They separated the men an
d they separated 
the women.  And 
they told us 
to undr ess.  I  mean, we were th
e four wome n and t he me
n wer e  somewhere else
.  And we sa w quit e  
a big cr owd of people outside.  J ust  like you se
e the pict ures of the refugees, these children an d 
wome n a nd me n, j ust wa lking ver y 
sl owl y.  And t hen t he y, s o me wo
me n c a me in a nd t ook us t o a  
corri dor  and ther e was a door t hat 
op ened and they put us
 into the chamber. 
 And it was room not 
bigger than ma ybe 10 by 12, ma yb
e, I couldn't tell.  Th
e door opened from th
e  ot her  side  and t he y  
pushed in the men.  
And so here we were and th
ey closed the doors.  And he
re we were in that little 
room, it wa s ma de out of brick or pl
aster, I just don™t quite remember
.  I know the r e wa s a bl ue l i ght  
on top and there was a 
drain in the fl oor.  It seems to me li
ke there was a pipe 
on the ceiling but it  
didn't l ook li ke a shower at all. 
 There were, what I think today it wa
s, that when we  we re bei ng de-
lous ed, the y wer e putt i ng, we woul d undres s in on
e room and put out clot hes on a cart , whic h wa s  
wheeled i nto a sort of chamber , th
e door wa s cl os ed.  The n we went
 through showers.  That wasn't  
wh en , th at wa s later wh en we wer e
 in the camp.  Then 
we went through shower
s, and then on the 
other s i de we would get our cl othe
s.  And it seems to me that they
 had s everal c ha m bers li ke tha t  
because ther e were t housands of us at  one ti me that
 the y wer e  givi ng us the  
baths.  And it seems to  
me that that was the cham
ber t hat  we were locked 
into.  And after a while,
 I  mea n, we jus t  st oo d 
there , but for just a fe w mo ment
s, a fe w mi nute s, the door opene d 
and t he y pushe d in two women, 
naked.  And they thre
w in a little baby that look
ed kind of crippled, they 
just threw it on the floor 
and shut the  door a gain, and the n
 we kn ew that we we re done fo
r.  And not hing wa s ha ppe ni ng. 
And you know, some
times you can't, some
times time goes very
 fast and someti mes 
time stands still.   
And at that time it was st
anding still and we didn't 
cry, we didn't scream, we
 didn't do anything. 
And the door opened and one of the 
SS men, I think he ha d papers in
 his ha nd, he says, "The people

fr om Bergen-Bel sen are here, are 
the y here? " , i n Ger ma n .  And so
me body said, "Yah- v ol" and the n 
they said "Rouse".  So we started walking ou
t and the two women, th
e y were  counting us.  
Evidently they knew how 
ma ny of t he m were suppose t o be .  
And they pushe d th
e t w o wome n bac k 
in.  And shut the door a n d put us 
in an identical room, ri
ght next to it.  And I don't know how long 
we sta yed in there but , ma ybe ten minutes, ma ybe t w
e nty, ma ybe five , I coul dn
't tell .  And we c oul d 
hear muffled screa ms a n d it sounded 
like the baby mostly.  But not, it 
wa s, and the n i t  was quiet .  
And then t he y opene d our door and they sai d, " R ou
se", so we we nt out and 
they told us
 "________ 
________ ________
__ _________", a
nd we all nodded.  And then 
t he y took t he me n a gain on on e  
side a nd us t he ot her side, the 
fo ur wo me n .  An d ther e were  a 
whol e bunch of, t her e was a lar ge 
room wi th t he big wi ndows on eac
h side  a nd t h ese wer e J e wis h 
women who were evidently i n  
char ge of pr epari ng t he prisoner s.  And t hey were
 quite fri endl y, t he y wer e ver y ni ce.  The firs t  
thing the y did, they put us on s mall stool s and w ith what do you call it?   Clippers , they were n't  
electric cli ppers, they had to do it like  this in order  to shave your hea d, a nd they shave d  our hea ds  
and t he pubi c hair a nd t h e hair unde
r the arms.  And it all was in a pil e and I had ver y beauti ful hair, 
sort of reddi sh-bl onde  curls, and 
they were all on the fl oor.  A
nd t her e wa s  Betsy.  She  ha d blac k 
roots  alr eady bec aus e her hair wa s dye d, so all he
r hair wa s on t he fl oor .  
Anyway, we  looke d very , 
very str ange.  After  a  whi l
e we  got use  to eac h othe r.

Q: We 're going to go back justa little bit to before you entere
d the room that you were just 
descr i bi ng.  And were you undres se
d whi le you were i n t hat  room?  
A: No.  Ri ght out, when 
t hey, now I don't, it see m
s to me, in which room?  
Q: In the room that you were waiting and that th
e two women wit h the chil d 
wer e pushed in.  Wer e  
you undres se d be for e t hat ? 

A: No , we wer e  na ke d in that r o
o m , but we we re told t o undre ss .
  You see , they separ ate d the 
wome n, us , t he Hungari a n 
w o me n fro m th e men .  We w e re in 
two separate rooms.  And we were 

told t o undre ss, t he four wome n.
  Evidently the men we
re told to undress t
oo.  And t he n we c a me  
into that small chamber fr om on
e side and the men ca me i n from t he ot he r side.  Ther e wer e tw o 

doors to t hat  cha mber.  And s o we wer e na ke d i n 
that room.  An d then when
 they let us out again, 
they se par ate d.  We  we nt to one  si de a nd the  me n 
we nt t o t he  other side.  And we wer e all nake d. 
Q: So when you went to
 get you're hair shaved
, were you still na
ked?  Had they given you any 
clothes? 

A: Yes, we were still naked.  We
 were naked when we had our he
ads shaved and after they were  
sha ved, we wer e given clothes fr
om a big pil e that was on th
e side.  And I was give n so me 
under wear , j ust a pair of bloomers .
  Because I remember t hey were
 very large , ki nd of l ong, old-
fa shi oned.  And no br a, no sli p, j ust the bl oome rs
 and a dres s that was wa y 
too big.  And then t w o 
shoes, one s hoe  looke d l i ke a  s mall  ma n's s hoe a
nd t he other one  was j ust  a re gul ar woman's shoe . 
And they barely fit, they were fa
lling off my feet.  And 
I remember later on I 
found some string or 
somet hing, or ma ybe t o re
 out a piece of my dr e
ss, and made a t ie for t h
e s hoe .  The  dre ss ha d a  
cros s pai nted on the back wit h oil pai n t and act uall y 
the girl pai nted t hat cro
ss on my bac k.  And s o I  
wa s looki ng at that a nd we we re ta
l king, t hat we c o uldn't r un a w ay a nywhere  wit h a cr oss  on you'r e  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

bac k a nd t w o di ffere nt s hoe s.  But  a l so I  re me mber
 we  were  sta ndi ng ther
e waiting for things to 
happe n.  Wh en we s a w al l thes e pe opl e out side th
e  wi ndows a n d the girl s w
ho wer e  wor king the r e,  
they just very casually said, "You 
see all these people?".  "Yes".  "W
ell, in ten minutes they will be 
goi ng out t h rough t he c h i mney".  An
d ther e were chi mney'
s smoking.  So we 
were in that entire  
compound where there were 
the saunas and t he gas chambers and 
the crematoria was, it all seemed 
to be in that space.  
So  anyway, after we were 
dressed and we were take
n t o the barrack of t he 
Hungaria n wome n.  And th
en we  were gi ve n, e ach of us was gi
ve n, t h at 's right, 
each of us was 
given a blanket and a bowl, about th
is big, enameled bowl with a 
little hole on the side.  And that  
wa s ve ry i m porta nt beca use you c oul d put a piec e  of
 str ing though t hat hole
 and tie it up to you're  
dress because if you lost
 the bowl you couldn't ge
t any food because nobo
dy would l o an you t heir 
bowl because they, if th
ey can get another bowl of fo od they 
will eat it, so the 
bowl was probabl y  
you're  most preci ous pos sessi
on.  And I ma de  a 
whole art pi ece for my t hesis
 about the bowls.  I'll 
tell you about it later i f you wa nt to, but anyway, we
 were ta ken to a quar antine barr ac k.  It wasn't 
the barrack that we stayed in late
r on, this was a barrack
 that we stayed in, 
I t hink, for  two wee ks ,  
two or thr ee wee ks , I don'
t reme mb er.  But I know 
it was a quarantine and t hey
 just wa nted to ma ke 
sure that we don't ha ve s o me ki nd of a disea se an
d spread it al l over the camp
.  So we stayed ther e 
for, we still had to stand the ro
le call every morning ab
out 3:30 in the morn
ing or so, and they  
counte d us a nd the n the y  gave us this  bowl of s
oup wit h a small piece of 
br ead.  That was suppose  
to las t  us for  the whol e day.  And 
fo r the first week, it se
e ms  t o me li ke we  didn't  do a n ythi ng.  The  
second week, after the role call, they
 lined us up and some of us we
nt, still inside 
the camp, to dig  
ditches.  And some whe r e doi ng or
 taken somewhere else
.  I was take n to dig dit ches .  And I 
re me mber, a not her rea son that 
I remember it, it was sometime in
 the middle of the summer was 
beca use t he s un was ver y hot a nd I wa s getti ng s unbur
ned on t h e top of my hea
d.  And I took off my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

bloomers  and I ma de  a t u rban to pr ot
ect my skin.  So this was the qua
rantine and after, I think it was  
aft er t w o weeks, we wer e transfer
r ed to t he barr a ck t hat we wer e 
suppose to stay 
in.  And that 's 
where we stayed for the entire time until we
 were evacuated to 
Bergen-Belsen again. 
Q: Was this barrack in
 Bi rkenau as well? 
A: That was in Birkenau.  All th
at I de scribed to you ha ppe ne d in 
Birkenau.  An d so the barrack wa s 
the Hungarian wo me n's barrack in Bi
r kenau and it was just a regular 
barrack with the three tiers of 
bunks and I wa s on the t op ti er.  
Li k e  whe n we wer e  in
 Aus chwitz , I s h owed Robe rt  one of t hos e 
bunks  a nd we ha d a wi ndow on to
p.  And thi s was t he onl y a i r th
at  we  were getti ng, t he wi ndows  
fr om the roof.  There we re no wi
ndows on the walls.  And we were 
very cold.  It  was in the fall 
already.  And t he wi ndows 
were  just  pr opped up wit h a  stic k an
d then I got the id
ea t hat maybe we 
should close it because t he rai ns star ted t o fall . 
 An d so I climbed up, I 
me an I  st ood up a nd I  
reached over  and I pull e d the stick out.  That 
was crazy, I was crazy be
cause t he wi ndow came 
crashing down and br oke.  So he
re, we not onl y had r a in c o mi ng i n, 
but we al so ha d glass all ove r . 
An d t hat 's wh en  the  th
ing ha ppe ne d.  The cappo ( ph) ca me  
and she  made  me get down a nd 
screamed at me, and I said something to her, that 
wh y is she screaming, that
 I didn't want to br eak 
the window.  And she sta r ted to h
it me.  And she was a wo
ma n just li ke I s o I hit her ba ck.  Well , I  
didn't know any better.  And she al
most killed me.  I me
an, she started 
hitting me on th
e head.  She  
knocked out  one of my t
eeth, she broke anot her  one.  And t hen
 I was deaf for ab
out , I don't kno w  
for how long.  I think I have bee n dea f ever si nc e.
  So, I just, that was pr
obably one of the, one of 
the worst e x perie nce s be caus e she was a young woma n 
just like I.  And s he was ver y, very strong. 
Evi dently s h e wa s trai ned and her number was li ke 400. 
 She's been there, one 
of the first ones, fr om 
Cze chosl ova kia.  And all  those cappo
s (ph) t hat  I came i n
 c ont act wit h wer e from Czec hosl ovaki a .  
The y wer e t he cr uele st peopl e I have
 ever  met.  They wer e Jewi sh 
girls  t hat wer e trai ned and t hey

survived.  They had a little
 room off the main
 hall of the barrack and that
's where they, 
some of the 
barracks had two little rooms like that
, and that's where th
e cappos (ph) stayed.  And they had a bed 
and they ha d all kinds of goodies .  And the y woul
d steal br ead from us.  Whe n we got a loa f of  
brea d, it wa s  like  about  t his size , 
a  s q uare  loa f .  And what the y di
d wa s e a ch of us wa s  suppose  to 
get 1/ 4 of t h e loa f, and what they 
did was they didn't cut it 
int o four pieces, t hey cut it one piece her e 
and one piec e there a nd t h
e center was theirs
.  And the n the c e nter fro m
 t h e two other piece s were  
theirs too.  So they act ua
lly took almo st half a loaf
 to themselves.  
And then they coul
d tr ade t hat  for  
the pe ople  from Ca nada.  And I  do
n't know, you pr oba bly heard ab
out  t he people  fr om Ca nada  
because they were called, you kn
ow gol d was  di s covered
 in Ca nada, and in 
Poland Ca nada wa s 
paradise.  And these were
 the people that were wo
rking on the transports, 
getting all the stuff that 
wa s s muggl ed in and, before the 
Germans got to it.  Th
ey were sorting the 
clothing, the y were  
sorti ng thi ngs out, s o the cappos ( ph) had e verythi
ng be cause for brea d you could get anythi ng.  And 
they were just trained to
 survi ve and they were su
rviving.  So that was pr
obabl y one of my wors e 
experiences. 

Q: How did she, did sh
e leave you unconscious?  
A: Oh yes .  The n t he girl s took 
care  of me .  M y si ster-in-la w a nd 
Bet sy and whoever  else was t her e,  
evidently they got water a
nd poure d i t  on me  and I ha
d br uise s  all over a nd I brui se ver y easi ly s o I  
wa s really bl ack and bl ue  and luc kily she di dn't br eak
 my nose or whatever.  
So I just had black eyes 
and shi ner s under my eyes
 and then I wa s deaf.  An d I don'
t  know whet her she 
br oke my ear dru m s 
or what ever she did t o me, but I c oul dn't he ar a
nything.  But e vent uall y my
 heari ng c a me some what  
bac k but  not enough t o r e ally hea r. 

Q: Di d you have  any proble ms getti ng
 by in the  ca mp wit hout heari ng?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
62 
 
 
A: I wa sn 't c o mplet e ly de af.  I c
oul d hear but not enough to r e ally
 get along in the hearing wo rld, 
that 's why I have to ha ve  hearing aids .  I mea n, I 
t ake my heari ng aids out when I a m at  home alone  
with my husband and I can still he
ar, but, if he doesn't
 get too annoyed, but 
most of the ti me I  
learned to survive with h
earing.  No, it was all right
.  I could still hear
.  It wasn't just that I was, 
eventuall y t h e hear ing came back 
and I was not completely deaf so 
I could get al ong.  I  coul d hear  
the shout ing, "Rouse! ", or whatever else they we
re shouting.  So that wa
s all right .  And whe n I  
started working, I decided to ge
t t h e he aring ai ds.  But  ot herwi s
e, I wa s al wa ys tr ying t o, my 
childr en we r e use to it , that you s h
out or get my mother's attention, 
or what ever .  So t hat was one of 
the souve nir s that I  have  fr om t he  ca mp. 
Q: Di d you have  to go t o 
work again t he ne xt day?  
A: No, I couldn't.  I coul dn
't e ven get  out of t he bed but I ha d to
 go to the roll call
 s o t hey dra gged 
me out.  You se e I was  on
 the third fl oor so they 
let me sleep.  So me body 
else move d over and the y 
let me sl eep down.  And 
then they ki nd of dr agge d me over t o  
the roll call.  And I know I didn't go 
to work that day.  I d
on't know what happene d, I do
n't know whether they, ho
w t hey let me sta y, but  
I know I couldn't.  But I don't thi
nk it  lasted more than a day b
ecause the followi ng day I did go to  
work.  And t he wor k that  I did i n 
the ca mp re ally varie d.  I know 
that sometimes we walked outside 
the camp and with hoes
 and we made little, small pie
ces of clumps of dirt out 
of big clumps of dirt. 
And I don't , to thi s day I  don't 
know what, we we ren't  pla nti ng a
nyt hi ng, we were j ust c hoppi ng t he 
dirt i nto s mall cl umps.  And so 
that  wa s for we e ks I  was  d oi ng t h
at .  An d th en  whe n  the  winte r  
ca me we did, now the s n ows ca me pr etty earl y, ma
ybe Oct obe r, and we were goi ng int o the fields  
whether it was sunshine or 
rain.  It didn't matter. 
 Then when the weather 
got a little colder, we did 
get either a sweater or some kind of a jacket or 
a n over c oat , but nothi ng tha t
 would fit .  But we di d 
get another outer gar ment  aft er one of thos e ___
________ e xpe rience s were . 
 The lice were, I swear  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
63 
 
 
I probably will never see a 
bigger louse in my
 life , but when we were th
rough working 
and after we  
got our s o-c alled dinner , we s pe nt most of our 
t i me on t he bunks kill ing lic
e.  And these were n't  
hea d lice be caus e we di dn't ha ve any hair .  The ha
ir was growing about a quart
er of an inch or s o, 
but these lice live in, they are body
 lice, and they live in the seams 
of you're garments.  They ar e 
very hard t o get rid of.  And so e ver y so oft en 
we wer e suppose dly de-louse d, but ac cordi ng t o our  
theory, they might ha
ve killed the live lice but th
e eggs they just probably
, I don't know, they made 
them hatch faster in this 
area.  It seems t o me li ke we ha d more lice a ft er de-lousi ng t h an be fore , but 
the li ce probably were  one of t he bi gge st t ortur e s 
be cause he re you couldn't rest  at ni ght bec ause  
you had to scratch.  An
d I still itch someti mes wh
en I think about it.  So
, so much for the lice. 
Q: Di d you have , tell  me  about t he  food t hat you at e?  
A: Ok ay .  In  the mor nin g  we g o
t the coffe e, whi c h was br own wate
r.  And we didn't have cups, it 
was all, the bowl was the 
cup and e v erythi ng.  And 
we got t h e piece of br ead
.  S o meti me s we  g ot i t  
in the morning and some ti
me s we got  it in t he e ve ning.  And i n 
the  eveni n g als o, bu
t anyway in the 
morni ng we got a piece  of bre ad and 
that had to last us 
the whole day.  And at
 noon we  mi ght  have  
gotte n a bowl of s oup, whi ch was 
mostl y wate r wit h a fe w potat oe s,
 a  fe w t ur nips  fl oati ng i n it . 
And it tasted horrible.  And we stillthink they were putting salt peter in
to it.  That was the story, that  
they were putting salt peter 
to keep us quiet. 
 I don't know whethe
r this is true or 
not, salt peter is 
quite poisonous .  It i s s o dium nitr
at e as I know, but that 's  what we 
were told, that it was full of salt 
peter, that that's suppose to qu
iet you're ner ves a n d you become 
more obedie nt.  And then i n the  
evening we got more soup, it mi ght ha
ve been a little bit thicker, that
 might have been
, so we're just 
two pi ece s of potato, mi ght ha ve 
be en four  pie c es of potat o and 
maybe two turnip
s, and another  
piece of bread.  And someti mes ther e was a tiny little 
square of ma rgar ine or
 a tiny little slice of a 
kind of a sa usa ge, but t hat was ma
ybe just once a week.  Most of 
the time it was just dry bread.

And brea d beca me a, ha d monetar y
 value.  I f you want ed somet h
ing e l se  you c oul d t r ade it  for  
brea d. 
Q: Wh en you were wo rking 
di d you work 
with Betsy? 
A: Yes , wi th  Bets y an d Do ot-si e  
(ph) and the mother, we all stayed
 together.  Somehow for all that 
time  we were always together.  
And t hen anothe r work 
t hat I wa s doing was, t o thi s da y I ha ve no 
idea what it actually was, 
somebody said this was so
mething in connection wi
th ammunition, and it  
wa s a, we were led i nto a roo m 
with long tables.  And there was 
a nail on the table and there was a 
pile of ra gs and strips of
 rubber, just flat rubber 
st rips.  And we were s uppose t o pl ate braids.   The  

hook was t o hook on the be
gi nni ng, you tie d it up and t hen you st
arted to plait and roll the ball and 
hook on agai n.  And i n t h e mor ning 
a n SS woman, well fe d, woul d 
co me in and she would sit down  
and st art plai ting, and the n some bo
dy would, a n SS man wit h a stopwa
tch, would ti me her, a nd t he n  
they me asured it.  An d then they
 mu ltiplied it, I don't know, for ho
w ma ny hours we were working. 
Sometimes ten, someti mes twelve.  
So that 's how many meters of th
at stuff we were suppose to 
wea ve or pla it.  And at t h e end of
 the day we me as ured it , for e ver. 
 I mean, t here was an awful lot of 
me asuring going on.  An d if
 you wer e one me ter short , you ge t wh
ippe d wi th a whip.  And I 'd rat he r  
be whi ppe d wit h a whi p than poun
de d wi th fis t s beca use t he other 
thing what they 
were doing is 
pounding you wi th fis t s.  
So the whipping left welts but they were less painful than, there was just  
skin t hat wa s, you know, injure d.  
But if you were beaten up with fi
st s, t he n you're
 bones hurt and 
ever ythi ng e l se.  So I wa s ver y 
good wit h my hands and I rar e ly, 
I think I just got whipped once , 
that I  was  s hort , beca us e I t hink I  
wasn't feeling well  that da y, but 
mo st o f t he ti me I  w a s abl e  t o  
plait t he quota.  It  wasn't exact
ly the number of me ters that the 
woma n was plaiti ng a nd calcul ating, 
but we  ha d t o co me wit hi n a sort 
of a reasonable amount. 
 Most of the time I fi
lled up my quota so I 
wa s o ka y.  An d t he n I wa s als o se win g on  se wi
ng ma chi ne s.  And I guess t hes e we re uni for ms  or

whatever it was.  And as I recall ,
 this was about  the variet y of wo
r k that  I did.  There was th e 
fie l dwork a n d the n the se wing rooms agai n, a nd pr oba
bly t he l ongest I wa s  in those pl ai ting r ooms . 
And s o me body s aid t hat t hey were 
usi ng it i n c annons or , 
who knows what.  Oh ye
s, t hen also that  
wa sn't only the number of me ters th
at  we ha d to plait, al so how st
rong t he y were .  So you ha ve t o  
make sure that if the two SS wo
men start pulling on them, they w
ill not break it.  Because you got  
beate n up i f t hey br oke .  And t he n 
you had to fix it.  So  
I was very careful t hat 
I plaited them
 to their 
satisfa ction.  An
d t hat 's so much for  the wor k. 
Q: Di d you mostl y s pea k Hungari an?  
A: Yes, I spoke only
 Hungarian at that point 
because Betsy spoke 
a little bit of Ge
rman but we did 
not wa nt t o spea k Ger m an.  But 
I s poke Hunga rian.  
Another thi ng t hat  wa s happening a nd was  
probably very strange, but we 
wer e cooking.  When we wer e st
anding for hours in the roll cal l 
waiting to be counted and 
waiting for the time 
to pass by, we were talk
ing about food
.  We were 
exchanging r eceipt s.  And we wer e making up r eceip
ts.  I mean, you know if
 you woul d add t his t o  
that I think it would really tast
e much bett er, don't you thi nk so
?  And we spend a lot of time 
cooking li ke  that.  And one ti me a ve ry stra nge 
thing happe ne d.  Be cause 
one of t he women ca me  
by, she was l ate for t he r o ll call , 
but she made it on time though, by
 the time  we were counted.  We  
said, where wer e you?   
She had her brea kfast .  We ll, what do
 you mean?   She ha d sc ra mble d eggs 
and she  ha d ha m a nd she  had white 
bread and eve r ythi ng.  We ll it tur n
ed out that she was assigned  
to bri ng wat er or somet h ing t o on
e of t he SS women i n 
one of the ba rrac ks a nd she  brought it  in 
when t he woman was eat ing 
breakfast.  And then the prisoner
 woma n wal k ed out a nd t hrough the  
window s he wat che d her  eat .  And then she  descr i be
d it all t o  us .  It ha ppene d s ever al  ti mes , yo u 

know, the pr isoners watc hing the 
ca ppos ( ph) or the SS wome n eat
 regular  food a nd t h en thi nki ng  
that they ate it, or i magi ni ng that t hey ate it.  Ther e  were all ki nds of ver y st range things happe ning.

The r e were homose xual wome n 
wh e n we we nt to  wor k, a c ou ple o f 
the m wer e gra bbi ng at the gir l s.  
The y wer e  Uk raini a n wo men .  On e 
of the m bit me on my ne ck.  
But othe r women pus hed her a wa y  
and then I st ayed away fr om anybo
dy that looke d s t range, that a t  leas
t I felt they looked strange, so I 
really di dn't have too mu ch
 of t hat ki nd of experi ence .  But ot he
r girls tol d  me t hat t hey were raped 
by ot her wome n, but I  di dn't know 
a n ythi ng about  it.  And I  di dn't  wa
nt  to know anyt
hing about it. 
Q: Did you have anythi ng on you'r e uni for m ot he
r tha n that cros s on t he  back?   Did you ha ve a  
badge  or  anything?  
A: No.  Not that I recall .  Mayb
e I did have a tria ngle, you s ee I 
don't reme mb er.  I know I had the 
cros s on the  bac k. 

Q: And the other pe opl e i n
 your barrack, were they
 all  Je wi sh prisoner s?  
A: T he y wer e  all Je wis h Hu ng aria n wo men .  T hey
 were a ll Je wis h.  No w 
one woman gave birt h to  
a baby.  And that woma n was, th
ere wer e a coupl e of pregnant wo
me n.  One disappeared.  I know 
that the pregnant woman 
always asked for a little bit more food
 because she was pregnant and then 
one ga ve birt h to a ba by a nd t he baby wa s taken 
a wa y.  And I know she scr e
amed and sc
reamed and 
the cappo (ph) said that if she do
esn't shut up she will be
 taken away.  So, but 
that was right at the 
begi nni ng when I was there.  Anot he r thing t hat
 happe ned was that s o me  peopl e got Re d Cr oss  
pac kages.  And I re me mber
 one woman, you see ther e wer e stov
es in the barrack, it was already 
winter, and I  remember she cooked 
all kinds of stuff that
 she  got i n t he pa cka g
e.  And I 
re me mb er  
she gave me a little bit of the pot
ato water that she cooked the potat
oes in, she didn't give me the 
potat oes  but she gave me  potat o wate r in the bowl , an d I shared that wit h Be
tsy.  But I 
don't know 
that, we  he ar d t hat t he  Re d 
Cross was bringing packages.

Q: I f you would jus t go a hea d. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

A: We can start wit h the hospital . 
 I got some kind of an infection.
  I think it started with probably  
some chigger bites or so
me bug bites that I got working outsid
e.  And I always 
was quite sensitive 
and woul d s cratch.  I know t hat I scr atche d my l e gs
 a nd t hen I  gue ss beca use of t he dir t  and t hings 
that we lived in, I got some
 kind of an infection.  
It might have been also 
fleabites or whatever.  And 
it was getting worse and wo
rse t o t he poi nt where my
 le gs wer e ver y, ve ry swolle n.  And I c ould not  
wal k even.  Pus was ooz i ng a nd thes e wer e big, r oun
d circles all over my shin
s.  And so the y took 
me t o the hospital a nd t h ey reall y di dn't do anyt
hi ng.  I think they put s o
me Va seline or somet hing 
over  the wounds a nd c o vere d it  with 
so me  gauze and there I wa s lying 
a n d hopi ng tha t it will  he al. 
But at t he sa me ti me , the  Ger ma n doctors wer e 
coming in and dra wi ng bl ood fr om us .  And t hen  
injecti ng us wit h somet h ing and 
I ha ve no idea whether 
these were suppose to
 be medicati ons or  
wh atever, but anyway.  Th
en the y wer e al so doing vagi nal  an
d rectal exami nati ons with thei r  
fi ngers.  Wh ich wasn't exactly what
 I considered pleasant.  And it was rather very
 humiliating.  I 
just di dn't know what wa s goi ng o
n.  I was not the  only one .  Ther
e were s e veral wo me n  that we re 
singl ed out a nd we  were  sort of i n
 a  group and it  wa s e x
tre m ely humili ati ng.  
I was only 20 or  so 
and I j ust  di dn't feel t hat this 
was exactly t he treat ment I  want ed t o
 have but I was probably worried 
more about my legs.  And then 
I t hink I mentione d it be fore , t hat
 the women, t here was a coupl e of 
Je wish women doct ors a nd t hey said
 that they knew that 
there was going 
to be anot her s election i n  
the hospital so they dism
i ssed me t oge ther with s o me other wome
n because they were afraid that t he 
state I was in, I woul d have been sel ected t o the 
gas cha mber .  So I wa s put ba ck int o my regular  
barracks and I barely could walk.  But at that time, I was still working in that weaving business so I 
didn't have to walk into the fields
 and I was able to stand during the 
roll call and then just go to the 
barra cks , which were right on the pre mis es .  So it  wa
sn't like I had to go very far.  And event uall y  
my le gs hea l ed but  the y wer e, I had 
sort of scars all over, from my an
kles t o my knees, and I tri ed t o  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

be much more careful with scra
t ching a nd things tha t may aggra vat e the condit ion.  My legs  
eve ntuall y healed.  It took about
 a n other mont h or so, but anywa y, I wa s all right .  So thi s wa s 
anot her t hing that I wa nt ed to ta lk a b out .  The ot
her thi ng t ha t  I wa nte d to say was t ha t  about t wo  
mont hs be fore, t wo or t h ree mont hs be for e we we
re arrest ed, it might have been ar ound Christ mas 
time or maybe a little bit later, I 
discovered that I was pr
egnant.  And I went to a Polish doctor, a  
gynec ologist  who deter mined t hat I was about t w o 
mo nt hs pr e gna nt, ma ybe two-a nd-a- hal f, and he  
did a n aborti on ri ght i n his offic e. 
 And I was ver y sad t hat I had t o
 do it but in the circumstances I  
coul dn't pos sibly have a  baby.  And if I did ha
ve one, I woul d ha ve been pr egnant whe n the y  
arreste d us  a nd I  pr obabl y woul
dn't have survived anyway and th
e baby defi nitel y wouldn't  ha ve  
bee n alive today.  But i f you do t hink like that , i f 
you j ust kee p on t hinking all you're l i fe about t he  
child that wasn't born.  So, this 
wa s  anot her tra u ma t hat I ha d to live wit h.  The n I didn't gi ve it  
mu ch thought of course wh
en I was i n t he camp
, as I  sai d be fore, that na
t ure t akes car e of itsel f and 
I didn't menstruate since 
we were put in the prison in Krakow. 
 And I didn't me nstruate until I came  
to Ne w Yo r k.  And I rea
lly thi nk it was a blessing because I j u
st ca nnot i m age t housa nds of wome n 
without any sanitary facilities havi
ng their periods.  Now 
the ones that were in 
the camp a 
long time, 
they a nd the  cappos (ph) , some that kne w how to 
get around because their 
number was just maybe  
400 or  300 or so, a nd t he y
 were the ri ch ones and 
they might have bee n nor mal  alre ady, but t he r est  

of us j ust we re sterile I s uppos e.  But  wha t  a m
azed me was that really, it 
was al most like a miracl e  
that we didn't menstruate because it
 woul d have be en a big, big me ss. 
Q: Wh en you were in 
Budapest and before yo
u we re arrested . . . 
A: We  were in Krakow. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

Q: Oh, I 'm s orry, of c our se.  You 
we r e  in Krakow be for e  you wer e  
arr este d a nd you di scovere d t ha t  
you were  pr egnant .  Di d you ha ve a ny t houghts  
that the war might end 
soon?  Did you have a 
feeling t hat  t here 
was  just  no wa y?  
A: No.  We  di dn't r eally ha ve  
any hope .  We  di dn't know how 
long, how muc h l onger we c oul d 
survi ve i n t h e conditi ons that we 
were in and the circumstances t h
at we were in.  But it was so 
absolutely hopeless that we just did 
not think that this is the time to 
bring a child into the world.  So 
it was a very hard deci sion
 to make but I made that
 deci sion.  And a ft er that
, I di dn't sl eep wit h my  
hus ba nd anymore. 
Q: Can you talk a little
 bit about how these two ev
ents that you just mentio
ned have effected you're  
life si nce then? 

A: We ll, as I said, you never stop
 thinking of the child 
that you, well I can't 
say killed, but didn't 
per mit t o be  bor n.  And I have fo
ur wonder ful c hildre n a nd you al
wa ys t hink how wonder ful tha t  
one mi ght have bee n.  So my li
fe was ver y much effect ed by ev
er ythi ng that happened t o me 
beca use t o this da y I ha ve night mar es and I wake up and I don't know where I a m, a nd I have all  

kinds of physical problems.  What 
was it, a year and a hal f a g o I finally was sort of di a gnose d wit h 
an ail ment t h at I 've had for about 
t we n ty ye ars or s o.  That I woul
d c o me down wi th , or ma ybe mor e  
than twent y years, I came down 
with, suddenl y, wit h hi gh fe ver. 
 But it was like 104, and shakin g 
and practic al ly bei ng unc ons cious.  And it woul d come
 on qui te sudde nly.  It woul d las t  for s eve ral  
days a nd us ually I got better.  
And i t  woul d happen like  a bout e v
er y thr ee to four mont hs.  An d 
eventually I got sort of use to it 
and I  paid no atte ntion to it anymore .  But a year a nd a  hal f ago I  
had my neur osur ger y, but two months
 later, again I got this fever. 
 A nd t hi s  ti me it wa s  much mo re  
serious bec a use I , well , Robert  knows be cause he 
wa s ta king car e of me .  It was s o bad that , you 
know, you don't call you're doct or a ft er hours, a nd he 
got to c al l  the doctor a
nd fi nd out what to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

Whet her he should t ake me t o the hospit al.  And 
my doct or , who i s a physi cian, sa i d that I have  
something called the Brill 
Zi ncer  Syndr ome (ph).  An
d she researched it  and 
found out  that  a  lot  of  
people who had t yphus i n the  conce ntrati on c a m
ps, the ________ which ca
us es t he typhus  jus t  
bec o mes dor ma nt a nd every s o ofte n it wake s up and 
ca uses  t he fe ver .  But usual l y t h ey ar e mil d 
attacks and very fe w people paid much
 attention to it.  But 
this time I was really 
seriously ill.  It was  
104, you a r e  not joking you 
know.  My doctor put me in t he  hos
pital a nd just to do t he test s, a nd 
they ruled out every possible dise
a se  that could c ause t his ki nd of symptoms , like t ube rculosis a nd 
_________ and fe ver , and 
what is t he one in ________ wor kin
g, the Va lley Fe ver , a nd anyway, I 
don't know how ma ny tests they di
d a nd they s end my blood t o  a clin
ic and they were testing it for 
____________, but the s train
 that the y had wa sn't  exactl y, the re
sult s were quite i nconcl usive.  But  
when I went to Poland th
e following Summer, Ye
sh-e (ph) was still alive a
nd he said that he was a 
____________ and he s aid t hat t h
e  strain of _________
_____ was a speci fic st
rain that wa s in 
East ern Europe and it wa s called Ball -in-netsa (ph) or
 wha t eve r , and he sai d that the y s hould ha ve  
tested for tha t  and that de fi nitel y woul d ha ve be en
 positive.  But my doctor 
wa sn't goi ng to wait for  
any tests and he put me  on very 
hi gh dos es of t etr acycli ne .  And 
I was on tetracyc
line for about six  
wee ks and the fever subsi ded a nd th
e t ests wer e negative again.  And 
he says, well, let's wait for the 
six mont hs a nd s ee whet her you ge
t anyt hing a ga i n.  And I was s ort
 of use to it, you know, it was  
just matter-of-fact.  I was getting us
e t o it and t hat was it
.  But i t is a lrea dy t wo years  and I ha ven't  
had the fe ve r anymore so they decided the y kille
d off the __________.  A
nd evi de ntly you have to  
do it whe n the ____________ ar e a ctive , when you 
have the fe ver .  And 
anot her s y mptom whi c h 
wa s de scri be d in t he book, beca use  
that was the fi rst thing that the 
doct or a ske d, where is the ras h?  
And I ha d a  rash going fr om t he 
ar mpit down t he ar m and 
that was the first th
ing t hat he a ske d, 
whether I had the rash
 be caus e t hat was one  of the  ver y t ypic a
l symptoms of this 
sort of syndrome .

So t hat 's a n other thi ng t hat I had.  And a not
her  sympt o m t hat, now sinc
e we are talking about  
disea ses , i s t hat a fter I had, well ma ybe  whe n we
 co me t o Bergen- Belsen 
the second time we  can 
talk about it.  Or should
 we  talk about the di seases now?  Beca
use  anot her  thing wa
s I  had typhus i n 
Ber ge n- Bels en.  Everybody ha d t yphu
s.  I  di dn't have t uber culosis , 
I don't think so. 
 But t here are  
spot s on my  lungs that are calci fi ed
, but it 's sor t  of se conda r y symp
toms.  It's really is not too 
signi fica nt.  I mea n, I ha ve somet hi n g t hat 's c alle d 
a  B Lung pictur e, but i t s,
 the thing that was was 
the t yphus .  And a not he r thing t hat people wh
er e getti ng wa s star vati on ede ma .  And thi s was  
something that was really fright
e ning beca use you woke  up in th
e morni ng and you'r e eyes wer e  
swollen with bags under 
the eyes and they were 
getting mo re and more swol
len during the day. 
And t hat  wa s it.  I n thre e  da ys  you were dea d.  
I  me an, it  was  just  unbelie vabl e beca us e you coul d 
see the people swelling.  The faces 
woul d get swollen and the legs, th
e feet and t he ha
nds, and the n  
eve ntuall y t he whole body.  And as
 I underst and this was di agnose
d as s t arvati on ede ma.  And I 
didn't get it to that extent.  And my
 l e gs wer e  ver y swolle n, my fe et 
were s w ollen a nd my  fac e  just a  
little bit but somehow I 
recovered fr om it.  
I didn't die.  But 
it was very, very fri
ghtening and I have 
absolutely no tolerance for 
salt.  I am on an almost salt-free di
et most of the ti me
.  If I go to a 
resta urant , li ke for e xa m ple t oda y, a nd I  ha d t he  tu
na fis h sa ndwic h, I wi ll ha ve t o ta ke me dici ne  

when I c o me  home .  And I a m on
 medication the whole time, the di
etetics.  And my  doctor who is 
fairly new in town becaus
e my ol d doc tor r etire d a n d I  got a  ne
w one, and he  wa s 
very much agai nst  
the di etetic s and he just didn't th
i nk t h at I shoul d t ake the m.  And 
he as ked me t o st op it .  And t w o 
days later , Robert t ook me t o the doct or 's offi ce. 
 I couldn't go to work. 
 I gained about twelve 
pounds on the scale .  I c o uldn't ope n 
my eyes.  I c oul d not tal k .  I was 
s o s wol len t hat I  coul dn't e ve n

doctor 's offi ce and t he doct or could 
not belie ve it.  He said he ha s

never see n a nyt hing like it.  He sa ys , you go bac k 
on you're pil ls and rene we
d my pres cr iption.  And 
so these are still things that I'
ve had since I le
ft the camps. 
Q: Di d you e ver l ear n what
 ki nds of e xperi me nt s wer e being c onduct ed at all?  
A: No, I ne ver le arne d.  
All I knew is that 
they took quite a bit of bl
ood fr om us and they were 
injecti ng us wit h somet hi ng else a nd t hey were ta ki
ng, but they were doing so
 many things of that 
sort t hat you just didn't pay a ny attention t o it .  
And I don't  think t hat t hat  cause any, t hat was in 
Auschwitz, and the edema ca me in 
Ber ge n- Bels en, s o I don't  think that those t wo have anyt hing to 
do wit h eac h ot her.  And I don't 
know why I di dn't get  typhus in
 Ausc hwitz , ma ybe  beca use the y  
wer e de-lous i ng us .  But  t he t yphus
 was in Bergen-Bel sen.  And of 
course the psychological effects 
of the whole experi ence i s somet hin
g else.  Bec aus e I go to t he hair
dress er, I  put make-up on, and I  
wa s goi ng, you know, I got three gra d uate degre es and 
I di d ver y wel l .  I wa s on the De a n 's li st and I 
wa s, I got one of my Master's De gr
ee's in art with distinction, and 
I entertai n and I go out and I think 
I look very pretty.  But a lot of it is also a f
açade.  Because Ro bert knows 
t hat t here are ti me s t hat,  I  
call it I'm out of my head.  And I 
have to ha ve a nanny for the kids
 because I couldn't always take  
care of t hem.  So I was very fort unat e t hat I could 
a fford, or my hus ba nd c ould a f for d it.  So we had  
a nanny for sevent
een years, until Sir-re
-high (ph) star
ted High School, so sh
e was sixteen.  Well  
actuall y I ha d a nanny for longer 
than that because Mar garet was 
wit h us for se vent ee n year s and 
be for e that we had a na nny for five years .  So, I 
me an di ffere nt na nnie s, but the n we found one tha t  
stayed wit h us for seventeen year
s because I could not take care of the childr en.  And ver y few 
people know that because I, my ki
ds were brought up an
d I participated in PT
A a nd I j u st pr ete nde d 
that I lead a normal life . 
 And so I t hi nk I  fi
nish on the fa ct that I had 
a good façade and everyt hing, 
but ever y so ofte n the c hildre n w
oul d sa y, well mother  you never re
ally took care of us, it wa s 
Marga r et who did.  But I tried to be a very good 
mother a nd I t hink I did do
 a good job.  I made sur e

that t hey go to sc hool a n d do 
well i n school and what-not, but th
ere w e re ma ny ti me
s that, I call it I 
coul dn't t ake  care of t he m t he way, you know, I 
should ha ve .  And the r e wa s s o methi ng, al wa ys , I  
think I hel d the m whe n t hey wer e ba bies , but we  
had very lit tle physic al cont act whe n the y were  
growi ng up.  And e ven no
w, you know, i t  may be  just a pec k
 on t he c hee k or some thi n g like t hat , 
but you neve r see me kis s i ng the kids and re ally hu
ggi ng the m.  I do wit h my 
gra ndc hildren though . 
My gr andchi ldren I hug a nd I hol d 
and I play with them
, but some how wit h  my
 chil dre n , ther e was  
some ki nd of a barrier  that I c oul
dn't brea k.  And I know it  wa s a
ll i n my head an
d I wa s exa mined 
by a Ger ma n ps yc hiatri s t  for t he re st itution a nd he 
deci de d I wa s nuts .  Oh ye s, t he y r e wa rde d me 

restitution all right.  I get a m
onthly check becaus
e I figured out that they
 pay wasn't very high 
beca use , you know, at  fir st they ga ve me  a l u mp
 sum and it came out to ab
out $5.00 pe r die m for  
the time that I was in th
e ca mp.  But it  was mor e than not hin
g, but the n the y  awar ded me  a monthl y 
pension and they adjusted it since 
I have be en working, and then the y
 said, well, if you are working 
you really can't or don't deserve 
the full amount.  But then I petitioned and I send
 more letters and I  
have a st ack of correspond
ence with t he Ger man g
over n me nt, t hrough my l a
wyer who i s a Ger man 
man and very, very
 helpful and he specializes in the restituti
ons, so that's anot
her story that maybe 
worth pre ser ving.  All t h e letter s t hat  we were  
se ndi ng bac k and fort h t o  fi nd out whether I a m  
deser vi ng or  not . 

Q: What did you're  psyc ho
logical  stat e have  to do wit h t he r esti t ution?  
A: Oh, well what my psychological  state was t hat
 I was n 't, okay, my hus
band wa s s u pporting me  
supposedly.  They wanted 
to know how much money he wa s making
 and s o  on and I insi sted t hat in 
Ameri ca, women are independent  a
nd I  a m not able t o work.  You 
see, I didn't start working for 
money really.  For making a livin
g, until my second husba
nd died.  Before that when I was working, 
it was charity work and what
n ot.  An d I wa s teac hin g 
at the univer sity as a st
udent teacher.  I wasn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
74 
 
 
really wor ki ng for  mone y.  And so t h
e reason that  they awarde d me  th
e restitution was, it is really a 
pension.  Nobody can li ve on that
 pensi on beca use it wa s li ke $300
.00 and t he n every year the y  
adjust it for cost of li
vi ng, what eve r.  So it wouldn't eve n 
pay hal f the  rent for a s mall r oo m  
some where .  But I had to have a physi cal e xa min
at ion by a Ger ma n doct or a nd who deter mi ned tha t  
I had a chronic edema, or whatever
 he called it, and the
n, I don't know, whatever
 else his diagnosis 
wa s, a nd the n the y dec i ded to have me c hec ke d 
by a psyc hia t rist.  And he gave me t he sta ndard 
psychiat ric e xa mination and I ha d t o  fill  out all 
kinds of questionnaires, 
you know, whether I feel  
that I a m bei ng followe d and whet her I can s l ee p or
 whether I c an't slee p, do I have ni ght mar es , an d 
I actual l y ha d eve r yt hing that he was aski ng for, s o I 
sai d ye s.  And then he  
decided t hat  ma ybe I do 
deser ve some kind of a pensi on 
beca use he didn't t hink that anybo
dy woul d e mpl oy me in the stat e  
of mi nd I was.  So  
that 's  a not her stor y. 
Q: We  ca n c o me bac k i n more det ail t o t he r estit uti on later .  

A: Well, the thing is that 
as far as t he  restit ution i s c onc erne d, 
I have  c opi es of al
l the letters that I  
sent t o the lawyer and the copies of
 his letters to me and the final judgm
ent in all that.  It is all ver y  
interesting because it  took like 
maybe several  years of
 constant corresponden
ce and wanting more 
proof and more proof of this and 
t ha t  and s o met hing el se.  So, i f 
you think that th
at wo uld be an 
addition to it.  Because I really didn't hear an
ything about restitution in 
the whole mu
seum.  And 
there are a lot of people that ar
e getti ng mone y from the Ger m an gover n me nt.  One curi ous thi ng i s  
that once a mont h i n bet wee n t he  1s
t of August , it has to be after the 1st of August  and before the 
1st of November, I have to 
fill out a certificate of lif
e.  And it has to be nota
rized by a notary public. 
Yea r s ago it had to be als o, not certi fi ed, but made  tr
ue, I can't think of the, I can't think of the word, 
but it wa s in German and then eventu
all y it  st arted t o tr anslate it  
into English, that it had to be 
certi fied by a Ger man authority.  
So I had to send it to the German
 counsel in San 
Fr ancisco, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
75 
 
 
then I ha d to get it back and then I had to se nd it  
to Germany.  So this is
 something quite curious 
that I  t hink very fe w pe
ople know about it.  Ha
ve you known about it? 
Q: No. 
A: Well then you're the fi
rst one to learn about it.

Q: And go on. 
A: When I got ma rried i n  June , 19
47 t o Dr . Le vin, we decided t hat 
we didn't want to have children 
the first fe w years be cause we both wer e goi ng t o 
go to sc hool.  And I wante d to get my degr ee  
fr om t he Universit y of Michi gan.  That 's wher e 
he  was  going t o be for th
ree year s in surgical 
residency.  So when we 
were even still in, we got married in
 Dallas, Texas.  And I went to a 
gynec ologist  for my pr e- mari tal e xa mi nati on a n d he 
e xa mi n ed me a nd he told me t h at I don't ha ve 
to worry a bout getti ng pr egnant beca use he thinks  I 
am completely sterile.  My fa llopian tubes were  

plugge d, sca rred, and the r e was no way I c oul d possi bly get pregnant
.  And so, of 
cour se it was a 
great  shoc k t o me .  I told 
hi m my hist ory and he s aid, 
well, this is what contri
buted to it.  And I, of 
cour se, I di dn't wa nt to get marrie d, beca use my
 futur e husba nd was fro
m a large family.  There 
wer e  six chil dren a nd he wa s the onl y son.  Well , 
actuall y he had a hal f- brother, but he wa s the onl y  
son of his  mother , and he , they de
fi nit e ly wa nte d t o have  a gra nds
on or  gra nddaught
er, or whatever,  
so it wa s a great di sappoi nt ment  to 
hi m a nd he didn't te ll hi s pa rents .  
But he said he didn't care.  He 
still wanted to get ma
rried, even though I didn't, bu
t we did get married.  And 
I just tried not to think 
about it.  But I tried to plan my li
fe .  De fi nitel y go to school a nd ha ve s o me kind of a profes sion so 
that I  ca n be  worki ng a n d not mi ssi
ng the fact t h at I can't be a mo
t her .  So, actually I wa s s o bus y 
wit h t he uni versit y studi es t hat I  di d not reall y ha ve 
ti me  t o worry about  a nyt hi
ng el se at that poi nt.  
But  the n, he wa s fini shi n g his  resi de ncy a nd I was  
fi nis hing my gra duate degree and we were goi ng 

to move on.  And looking for a 
place to settle.  And I thought th
at maybe I should do something 
about it.  But we mo
ve d to Detr oit and I got  a j ob as a M e
dic a l  Te chnol ogi st at Mt. Car mel  Mer cy  
Hospit al a nd he wa s a su
rgeon t here .  And we had a ve ry good
 fri e n d wh o wa s a 
gynec ologist an d 
we told him my predicam
ent and he said that he
 will see what he can do.
  He gave me a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
77 
 
 
thorough examination and then I had,
 he put me on high doses of peni
cillin, back then
 penicillin was 
very much i n use .  And so i f there was any kind 
of infection, then it would 
definitely get cleared. 
And then in addition he put me th
rough quite painful treat
me nts.  It is kind 
of a little complicated, 
these are uterine injections of lapy
dol (ph), whi ch is a very he avy oil 
with, first he tried to blow the  
air through a nd he wa sn't 
able to, my t ube s were de fi nitel y plugg
ed.  And t h en lapydol ( ph) is a very 
hea vy oil and it has  s o me ki nd
 of an additive to it th
at it will show up
 on x-rays , a nd s o  he inje cted 
that and the lapydol (ph)
 is suppose to go throu
gh t he t ubes  and i f t he y , a nd t he weight  of it  
sometimes will open th
em.  And the tubes are rea
lly opened into the abdominal cavity and the good 
sign is when the lapydol (ph) spills 
into the abdominal cav
ity.  And it's quite painful because there is  
some kind of a nerve connection,
 especially if, the pain is h
itting the shoulders.
  And nothing 
happe ned wi th the i njec t i on.  And he  repeat ed 
it and a f ter t w o da ys t here was a spill on t he right  
side .  So he said, wel l , that was 
sufficient indication that
 thi ngs ma y be all ri ght .  And a few months  
later I di d get pre gna nt.  And so we  spent a ye a r
 in Detroit and then I 
wa s about t hree mont hs  
pregna nt when we le ft.  
And we ca me to Fres no.  
And my da ughter was born 
in August, we came to 
Fres no i n Dece mber and my da ughte r
 wa s born i n August .  So thi ngs t urned out for t h e best .  But  
wit hout me dical treat ments and all,
 I proba bl y would have not be en abl e to have c h ildren.  The  
Ameri can doctor  who exami ned 
me the first time, 
whe n I went  t here for  my pre- marit al 
examination, because I was getting ma
rried and I didn't think that I 
wanted to get 
pregnant right 
awa y, sai d that I proba bly would 
ne ver  get pr egnant  beca use my tube
s were s carre d and pl ugged up .  
And that I don't have to worry 
about getting pregnant. 
 And he wanted to 
know what c
ould have 
caus ed it .  And I wante d to know
 what the ca use mi ght  have bee n
 a n d he  sa ys , well, one  of t h e  
caus es that usuall y plugs up the t ube s is an infe c
tion and its mai nly gonorrhe a and I sai d, well , how 
on eart h would I ha ve gotten gonorr hea and he s ays , 
well, you just think. 
 And you kn
ow you can  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
78 
 
 
get gonorrhe a by a n inte rcour se wit h  an infecte d 
pers on, whic h I di d not ha
ve, a nd so I told hi m 
about the gynecological ex
aminations that I was ge
tting in the camp.  And th
at when I was in the 
hospital with the skin infection, th
ere were also doctor s comi ng in 
and poking their fingers into us, 
and I di d not think that  they were havi ng st eril
e gloves on because they wer e going fr om one 
woma n t o a not her without cha nging the gl oves.  Th
e y were protecti ng t he ms elve s but not us.  And 
these wer e vaginal and rectal ex
a mina tions a nd t he  doct or, the Am
eri can doctor who exami ned me  
in Dallas, he said ye
s, that  was sufficie nt 
t o get you infect ed. 
Q: How long all told were you 
in the hospital
 at Auschwitz?  
A: I rea lly don't quite re me mber .  It coul d ha ve b
een, proba bl y around ten days .  And one t hing tha t  
I reme mber very distinctl y was th
at someti mes they were dressing th
e wounds on a tabl e.  We wer e 
in bunks all t he way ar ound a nd ther
e was a space in the center and 
they would put the patient there 
and s everal doct ors woul d be st anding around he r  a
nd doi ng a ll kinds of t h ings so t hat we c oul dn't  
really see, but one time I saw her 
le gs.  I t hought mi ne wer e in a 
bad s ha pe, but her 's wer e so ba d 
that you could see the bone.
  The flesh was just  pr acticall y r ott ed
 a wa y.  And one  of the thi ngs  that  
they woul d, they didn't do the ma
ggot treat me nt t o me, but it wa s ver y popular i n Eur ope t o us e 
ma ggots t o treat this kind of woun
ds .  And I know that her le gs we
re just crawling with maggots .  
And evidently maggots were
 putting some kind of an enzy me or
 whatever, that wa
s killing the dea d  
tissue.  Or maybe they were eatin
g the dead tis sue  and that sti mulate d the granulati on a nd gr owth of  
the ne w tis s ue.  And t h at wa s one 
of the cures .   So the y di d us
e ma ggots, but th
ey didn't us e 
penicillin.  They 
didn't use maggot
s on me, I some how got better. 
Q: Were  the y tre ating you i n a ny wa y th
at  was  producti ve?   
That was helpful? 
A: Well , as I say, it s ee ms t o me 
that they put s o me ki nd of  an 
oint me nt  on my wounds a nd t hey  
were so mewhat helpful, so that th
e oozing stopped.  It looked l ike 
Vaseline, but I can't believe that  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
79 
 
 
Va seline al one c oul d ha ve c ure d, but anyway, at  l
east the things were no
t full of mud and dir t ,  
whi ch I would have gott e n in the regular barrac ks , or eve n goi ng to work.  So there were  bandage s,  
they banda g ed my le gs a nd they we
r e  at least kept clean.  I was a prett y he alt hy a nd str ong per son at  

that time and I guess it was 
my resistance and ju
st my natural ability to heal
.  And to this day I heal 
very well.  I get a cut on
 my fi nger and two days la
ter it is gone, so maybe 
it was just my ability to 
heal  well. 

Q: And you me ntioned that yo
u left  the hospital before yo
u wer e c o mplet ely he aled?  
A: Yes.  I left  the hospital because
 of the on comi ng sele c
tion.  And t he doctors  
that were there, th e 
wome n doct ors, t hey we re Jewish 
women doct or s.  The y wer e afr aid
 that the selection may not be 
very selective and they 
may just reduce t he number
 of patients so they 
di dn't want  
anybody who  
wa s well e n ough to wal k out , wa s aske d to wa lk out. 
 And a s I say, a fter  that, I we nt  back to my  
barra ck a nd I wa s abl e t o sta nd t he r oll call a nd I 
wa s able to walk to th
at place where we were 
plaiting the braids.  And sitting all 
day, I could still keep my bandages
 on my legs and 
then I think a 
couple  of ti me s, as  I r ec all, I  we nt t o 
the hospit al and I ha d t he  ba ndage s c h anged. 
Q: Di d you e ver see  Yannosh (ph) , y
ou're husband, du
ring this time?  
A: Ya nnosh (ph) disa ppe ared a bout 
half wa y.  I t h ink I sa w hi m a fe
w ti mes and I sai d  he ca me on  
some erra nds, he br ough
t  some stuff wit h the ot her wor kers t o
 the  ca mp.  And I 
don't know exactly 
what, and I was ab
le to say a fe w words to hi m.  But it was 
not more than two or
 three times.  The  
first time when he came wa
s to, he told us that fa
t her died, and that was j u
st maybe like a fe w days, 
ma ybe a we ek or s o, ma ybe t wo w
e e ks a fter we wer e separat ed int o the different c a m ps.  He di ed 

very soon after he got there.  Bu
t  I di dn't s ee Ya nnos h 
( ph)  maybe for t hre e mo
nths a n d a ft er t hat I  
didn't see him anymore.  I don't th
i nk I saw hi m after Oct ober.  As 
I reme mber, t he last ti me I saw 
him was the weather was s
till bearable and then in October it started to get 
very cold and snow, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
80 
 
 
I know I didn't see him anym
ore.  And I tol d you be fo
r e  t hat  wh en  I wa s in 
Pari s, that  ther e wer e  
two guys that said that 
t h ey kne w hi m in c a mp and that he  was 
select ed and that t hey never saw hi m 
agai n.  And evidentl y be
cause he was crippled. 
Q: Do you r e me mbe r  that last ti
me you s a w hi m?   What 
you sai d to hi m, what you said to ea c h 
other?   Anyt hing a bout t h at
 las t  ti me  you sa w hi m?  
A: I didn't know it woul d be t he la st
 time .  I didn't think that each 
time was the last time, but there 
was very little that 
we could say to each other. 
 It was, I d
on't remember. 
Q: And you menti one d there was a not her place  that
 you were wor king, be
si de in that, another 
place?  

A: Yes, I  was also worki
ng on some kind of a br i c
k-laying pl ace.  And I r e member one thi ng, t hat 
one of the guar ds co mpli mented me.  That I ha
d a very good a bilit y to me asure the dist anc es  
beca use  my bricks wer e laid ver y e v enly a nd I 
was spreading the mortar, 
I thi nk I was but tering a 
slice of bread, and that the bricks
 were built very, very evenly and 
very nice.  And what we were 
worki ng, and that was a very s
hort time that we were working 
on it , wer e large , round, bric k 
struct ure s.  I t  doe sn't se e m t o me t hat  they were
 e ver fi nished, but by t hen
 we , of cours e , we kne w 
exactl y about the cremat oria and 
we kne w about ever ythi ng e l se.  A
nd what these str uctur es were 
suppose to be was, and I 
don't know wh ether that 
was t he hearsay or what ever , but t hat 's what we  
wer e ki nd of heari ng, t ha t  thes e were  goi ng t o be s p
ecial  ext er mi nati on places 
with sort of electrical 
contraptions that would be electr
ical crematoria and electrical k
illing, the high volta
ge.  But I don't 
know whether that wa s t rue
 and I  ne ver r eall y found out  wha t th
e se struct ures  were .  And whe n we  
were in Auschwitz, I was 
telling Robert about these structures
 and the first ti
me we went to 
Ausc hwitz he says, that 's  what you descri bed.  A
nd I sai d, ye s, tha t 's what  I was worki ng on.  An d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
81 
 
 
we ne ver found out in Ausc hwitz 
what these t hings wer e supposed
 to be.  But 
it wa s ve ry, we 
probabl y wil l  go a gai n a n d I 'll 
tr y t o fi nd out what t hey were . 
Q: T hey  wer e in  Birk
enau, these structures?  
A: In Bir kenau.  Ri ght  past t he crematoriu ms, or
 along si de t he cremat or
iums.  And I don't think 
they were ever fi nished. 

Q: You me nt ione d earlier  that  by 
the time you got to
 Au schwitz you were hear
ing more  ne ws of the  
war and of the outside world.
  Do  you recall some of 
the ne ws that you he ard?  
A: Not r eall y.  I ju st k
now that, well actually it was 
more in Ausc hwitz than in Belsen-Bergen.  In 
Bel sen- B ergen, what ever  news we 
got was when t he ne w tra ns port ca me
.  But all the transports that  
wer e comi ng to Bergen- Bel sen wer e  mai nly fr om
 Holl and or from ot he r co
untries, fr om smaller 
countrie s.  And t he y wer e  ver y s mall t r ans port s.  
And i t  se e ms  l i ke, as  I me ntione d be for e, t hat t he y 
all seemed to be of pris
oners or some politica
l people that were 
rather taken care 
of.  As I say, we 
weren't, we didn't seem to
 be doome d  or anyt hing.  Just like t h e Hol l and di a mond cutt er s, the y were  
being sor t  of guar ded a nd preser ve d.  And so, i f a 
ne w transpor t ca me, they mi ght have t old us what  

wa s goi ng on.  But we really di dn't know.  Bu
t while we were i n  Aus chwitz , there were 
undergr ound radios and t hen a l so t her e wer e a lo
t o f wor kers wh o were g o
ing outside  and c o mi ng  
bac k i n t he eve ning a nd the y woul d bri ng some  
ne ws  that what wa s ha ppe
ning on t he fr ont  a nd 
wh at was ha ppe nin g wit h the war .
  And at one poi nt we knew t h
at the Russia ns 
we re comi ng a nd 
that the siege of War saw, and thi n
gs like that.  That there was an 
uprisi ng in Warsaw.  And I just  
don't re me mber r eall y.  We  were
 much mor e c onc erne d about su
r vivi n g fr om da
y to day than 
worryi ng what was  ha ppe ning outsi de .
  Ther e were raids, air r ai ds. 
 There were quite
 a few air raids 
and we were  hopi ng that  they w
ill bomb but the y didn't .  The ai
rplanes wer e swoopi ng down but  
they were  ne ver r eally thr owi ng a ny bombs  on t he 
cre mat oria a nd we were  disa ppoint ed bec aus e we  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
82 
 
 
thought t hat  maybe the y  woul d des t r oy t he  cre m ator
iu m, the y c oul dn't be used.  But  the y wer e  
sayi ng that it was t he Ameri can pl anes t hat we
re comi ng.  And we coul d he ar the anti- cra ft  
shooting, but I don't thi n k the y ever
 shot down a ny pl ane s ei ther, 
but they were just shooting at 
them.  And so, but we really ha
d very, very little contac
t with the outside wo
rld.  And when we 
wer e in Bergen- Bels en, we di dn't know a nyt hi ng. 
 But we haven't gotten to 
Bergen-Belsen yet.  We  
are still in Auschwitz.  A couple
 escaped, there were people esca
ping.  And we witnessed one 
hanging of a couple tha t  escape d.  And we unde
rstand that there were 
more esc a pe s and mor e  
hangings , but we did witnes s one.
  And t here wer e also suicides
.  I me an, it wa s ver y e asy t o  
commit suicide if you could just ge
t to the hi gh volt age wires .  And so me peopl e did.  Anot her thi ng  
that happened that was quite a re
gul ar occurrence were t he lat rines. 
 I mea n, we had t o go when we  
wer e or dere d to go and I  don't know whether you sa
w t he pi ct ures , I di dn't  see any pi ct ures i n her e 

of the latri ne s, but it wa s a ce ment kind of a bl ock 
in the center of the barra
c k wit h holes .   A doubl e  
row of holes .  And you wer e su
ppos ed to do your business t here . 
 And t hat s ure was  not a ver y  
pleas ant  sight or  a ver y  plea sant ti me .  And this
 one thing that I was r
eally sufferi ng from was 
constipation and to this da
y I still have to be very
 careful what I eat and wh
at I do and the timing 
beca use , I  don't wa nt t o talk about 
it, Robert.  Bu t maybe th
is is important that it
 is recorded
 too.  I 
mean, you don't like to talk about th
es e things , but I re me mbe r  one nigh
t.  I me an, at ni ght i f we ha d 
to go, t here was a bucket .  And I 
r e me mber  one night  I had to go an
d t he c appo ( ph)  woul d not  let, 
and I think it was Betsy with me, 
they wouldn't let us until we emp
tied the bucket.  
And the bucket 
wa s about , like a 30 gall on ga rba ge c an, ma ybe 25 
gall on ga r bage can, I know it was n 't  as high as  
that, it was a bout this hi gh.  And she s aid we have 
to carry t he garbage can to
 the latrine, there was a 
ditch that you poured it  
in, be fore we can use  it.  And that 's 
not a ver y ple asa nt feeling eit her .

Especiall y when, i f you do
 have an accident, t her e's no clean cl
othe s that you ca n put on.  And there  
is no way of wa shing it. 
Q: So t w o pe ople  would c arry the se buckets  a nd th
e se buc ket s ar e a bout t w o or t hree  fee t  high?  
A: About t w o and a hal f  fe
et hi gh.  Like  a garba ge ca n, but i t  
wa s mor e l i ke a drum wit h sort of 
handles, wi re handles or 
somethi ng, and we carri ed t hat .  And 
it was pretty full.
  An d we  were  
trying t o c ar ry it ver y c a refull y s o t h at it woul dn't sp
l ash beca use , a s I said, i f
 it splashed
 on us we 
had no way of clean up and these pr oba bly were  
the wor st time s.  Pr oba bly muc h worse than not  
havi ng enough food.  B
ecause you really dealt wit h, I don't  r
eally want  to say, but  it was shit . 
[Laughter]  But that
's what it was.  And I can't
 understand how I can laugh now
, I r eal ly can't .  But  I 
do.  Ma ybe  t hat 's why I s urvi ved.  M a ybe
 that 's why I ' m not  
completely crazy. 

Q: You ment ione d that t h ere we re
 ha ngings going on, or that you 
witne sse d one ha ngi ng.  What was  
the r eason?  

A: They esc a pe d a nd t he y were  ca
ught.  The y were br ought bac k. 
 There were more hangings i n  
Prostej ov and they al wa ys ma de  
ha ngi ngs  publi c to scar e us, I  su
ppos e.  But my br other  was  in  
Prostej ov a n d he ha d a girlfri end.  And I thi nk he  
was quite fond of her a nd he wa s st ill able to go 
out beca use he was goi ng to work i n the fac t or y, t h
at was after my father wa
s alre ady gone .  And he  
ca me, I neve r saw hi m c r y.  He wa s a very brave guy. 
 And that  ti me he c a me in and I ha d a place t o  
me et hi m and I woul d br i
ng hi m s o me food and s t uff.
  And he said that th
ey were, that they did  
hang the gir l  and some  ot her people
 with he r.  And why?   Some body 
tri ed t o  esca pe a nd t hey caught  
them and then they just took people at random a
nd she wa s one of the m.  An
d he sai d, it coul d have  
bee n hi m, it coul d ha ve been anybody else, but the y
 did ha ng her.  So, I try not to thi nk about thes e  
things. 

Q: Di d you e ver consi der trying
 t o esc ape  or  do a n ythi ng?

A: No .  Bec a use we k ne w that it was  i mp ossi ble .  
I mean, the people that di
d esca pe , I really don't  
know of a nybody that  es cape d and 
wasn't c aught .  Beca use  the  way 
the  ca mp wa s sit ua t ed, it wasn't  
like the r e were woods a nd you c an just hi de a n
d what not , unle ss you had re ally help from t he 
outsi de .  And I r eally don't know
 much about it.  All 
I know is that between the barbed wire, 
electri fi ed, and the guards in the 
towe rs, and the dogs , it wa s i mpos s
ibl e.  That a nybody who woul d 
try mi ght  as  well  fini
sh off on t he  wir es. 
Q: Wh en were you deport
ed t o Bergen-Belsen? 
[End  of Si de A of Tape 5] 
Q: I had just aske d you when you wer e deport
ed again to Ber g en- Bel
sen fr om Au schwitz? 
A: Okay .  It  wa s Dec e m ber a nd  I b e lieve it  was De
cember the 29th because 
the trip lasted about  
four da ys , ma ybe thr ee .  I don't  know, but all 
I know is that New Year
's Eve was on t he tr ain 
because t he Ger man soldiers, t he 
SS men, t he guards were cel ebrati ng
.  And __________, that 's th e  
toast they were making, a
nd yelling and drinking
.  And I swore that if I ev
er get out, I will always 
be very ha ppy on New Yea r s Eve .  I wil l  al wa
ys re me mbe r  the night on t he tr ain.  And I do 
re me mb er it .   I e ven  re me mb er t hin kin g, my  hair 
was a bout ma ybe  an inc h and a hal f l o ng or ma yb e  
a little bit longer but it was still very, 
very short, and I was 
just wondering, just 
dreaming that maybe 
by the  next  Ne w Years  Eve  my hair w
ill be long enough to 
go to a party.  And 
I was i n Paris a year 
later.  And I  had a big ba r rel of 
cha mpagne a nd I t h ink I got r eal ly, r
eall y pla stere d.  M y hair wa sn't 
long enough to be
 r eall y good but  it wa s long
 e nough.  It  was  all  right . 
Q: The t rain ride
 took how long? 
A: I don't know.  I think, I a m quite
 s ure that it , you see , so me  of 
the date s I try to re me mber, but I  
think it was the 29th in t he even
i ng because it was dar k 
and I remember 
Doot-sie ( ph) j u mpi ng up  
and down tr ying to j oin us.  They se parate d her 
from Bets y a nd me bec ause we were going to go on

the train.  And I don't know what was better, whether 
to stay in the camp or to go on the train, but  
we had no c hoic e.  And I felt very, very ba d a
bout leavi ng her beca use her mothe r was gone all 
ready and she was j ust left alon
e.  And I know she was cryi ng 
and s he l o oke d like a skelet on al l  
ready and we didn't look 
muc h bett er , but she looked real ly ba d.  And that 's why the y didn't let her  
go.  They selected peopl e
 that wer e i n a  be tter shape  I gue ss , so
 I didn't think that
 I'll ever see he r 
agai n, and I  didn't .  But  I  also 
thought that I wouldn't 
see  her again bec aus e sh
e wouldn't survive the 
orde al.  But she di d s urvi ve.  An
d I think I me ntioned a
ll about  her be fore , but a nywa y Bet sy a nd I  
were put on the train. 
Q: Ca n we go bac k jus t  a bit t o
 when you me ntioned Doot-sie 
(ph) mother ha d al ready be en  
separated fr om you.  Will yo
u tell me when that ha ppe ne d?  

A: Well that happened about two 
or three wee ks be for e.  You see,
 we we nt to sa una and t he de-
lousi ng s o-c alled.  And when we
 we re compl etel y undres sed, you se
e the routi ne was as I said we  
bundle d our clothes a nd put it on t his cart whic h wa
s whe eled i nto t he de-lousing c o mpound whic h I  
think were the temporary, 
provisional little gas chambe
rs, but anyway, that's 
where we were.  In a 
room where we undressed and then 
the SS men came i n
 and st arted t o whi p right and left , right and 
left.  And Doot-s ie (ph) mother 
wa s by then, she wa s an 
ol der  woma n, I mean toda y its  not an olde r  
wo ma n if you're in you're late 50'
s or so.  But she wa s in a bad sh
ape and she was r
eally very, very 
skinny a nd very ol d looki ng.  And so she was pus h
ed a wa y together wit h s o me ot her ol der wome n 
and Doot- sie  (ph) a nd I and Bet sy 
were pushed t o the ri ght t o go 
t o the sauna.  
And I remember  
Doot-si e (ph) really went  into hys teri cs and s he 
r an to her mother and the y wer e hol di ng onto her  

and the guar ds were j ust  
whipping her and pushing her and really
 s epa rate d us .  An
d they pushed us 
into t he s auna and cl ose d  the door.  And Doot-si e
 (ph) was in complete 
hyst erics  be c ause she wa s 
really, real ly always ver y  close to
 her mother .  The n we went throu
gh t he ba th and we nt bac k to our  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
86 
 
 
barra cks .  And I know s he crie d all night.  But t h
en we found out that the 
mother was in so-called 
Shoni n's (ph) bloc k wher e they kept
 peopl e suppos edly t hat we ren't a ble t o work a nymo r e and t hey  
wer e ki nd of shelt ered.  And ta ke n c are of.  And she c r
ied and she was ve ry ph
ilosophical about it 
when we sa w her.  She s ays , well
, I s uppos e I 'm going ou
t through the chimney. 
 And Doot-s ie ( ph)  
we nt int o hysterics and t h
e mot her said that she wa
s ve ry, ver y  thirst y.  Tha t
 the soup that they got 
wa s terri bly salty and they di dn't
 get  any water .  And t here wa s 
no way we could bring her any  
wat er.  I mean, we couldn't carry 
it in the bowl because 
they would ha ve seen 
it and t here were n o  
bottles and she said that sh
e really just lost the will to live. 
 Mainly because sh
e was so terribly  
thirst y.  And we c a me t h e ne xt da y a gain to se e he
r and sh e was in a worse 
case even.  And she sai d  
that she was just too weak to ev
en wal k.  And then I guess that 
evening they fi nished them off 
beca use  we ca me t he ne xt da y a nd, I ' m quit e s ure  we
 saw her at least  t wice. 
 And then t he next da y 
they were all  gone.  The barra ck 
wa s empty.  You see, we could mo
ve ar ound a fter 
work.  I me an, 
we s o meti mes woul d get  a per mi ssi on to go out a nd go to the other barrac k.  So they were just ta ke n 
to the gas.  And evidently we were
 told too by the old timers that 
the peopl e that the y were goi ng t o  
gas , they we re fed salt y food, very 
salty soups so that they were so thirst y that they would just going 
hal f cra zy a nd they would just a s soon go int o the 
ga s cha m ber tha n to s u ffer
.  So they just went.  
They were not fighting or they were
 not tr ying to save t he ms e lves . 
 The fa ster the bett e r .  So, she  
wa s gone. 

Q: Was  Doot-sie ( ph) younger t ha n you?  

A: Oh no, Doot-s ie ( ph)  wa s quite a bit ol der .  
No, she  was , I  don't  re me mb
er, in the  book it  sa ys  
what year  she was born, but Yannic
k (ph)  was bor n in 1921 a n d Doot
-si e  ( ph) might ha ve bee n fi ve  
years olde r, fi ve or si x years ol
der .  The y were t he only t wo ch
ildr e n t hat  they ha d.  But s he was  
quite  a  bit  ol der.

Q: And whe n t he da y of t he selec tion 
ca me, di d you have a ny fore war ning?  
A: No.  Absolutely not.  We  had 
no i dea  of what  wa s goi ng on.  
And agai n, it wa s, 
they gave us a 
bath again.  All the selections wer e taking place 
i n  saunas.  And I had no idea whether Doot-si e (ph)  
wa s taken to the gas chamber or whether she wa s ju
st select ed out to sta
y.  But I know t hat t he  
people that were selected to go, 
we had to, I thi nk we wer e bat hed 
a gai n.  I me an, we took a s hower .  
And t hen got the clot hes from t he  de-lousi ng cart 
and a ft er that we wer e ke pt i n a s ort of a  
compound by the rai l roa d trac ks.  
And I thi nk we wer e allowe d to 
ta ke the bl anket.  Bec aus e we  
use d t he bla nket s for sha wls  a nd for , and the blan
kets  ha d t o go t hr ough de
-lousing, so I am quite  
sure that we came to Bergen- B el
se n wit h bla nket s, be cause we wer e not given a ny when we wer e  

there.  Because i n Bergen-Belsen we, it was j ust ba
re floor and some bunks.
  But Bets y and I wer e  
sleeping on the fl oo
r, not on the bunk. 

Q: And wh en you left  we re yo
u ta ken in a  trai n i mme diate ly 
or did you go in a truck? 
A: No, I think we  were lo
aded on the train and I don'
t think it was mo re than an
 hour or so that the 
train left .  I think they loaded us up and it wasn't 
li ke the ot her trans port s.  
You know, t hat they kept  
us on the trai n and we we
ren't reall y very squi shed either.  I 
me an, it was s q uishy but we  coul d s ort  
of stretch out.  I mean it wasn
't li ke sta ndi ng room onl y.  
And it was more like they were  
trans porti ng us t o use  us for s o
met hing and not  to e xter mi nate  us. 
Q: But you had no idea 
where you were going? 
A: We had  no i dea  whe r e we wer e
 goi ng.  And we  just kne w t hat
 we were going 
away fr om the 
cremat oria.  So we wer e rather  h
opeful.  We were rather
 hopeful.  An d wh en 
we arrived in Bergen-
Bel sen, somehow we he ard that 
it was Bergen-Belsen, and Betsy 
a nd I were ver y ha ppy and we 

wer e telli ng ever ybody 
what a wonder ful pl ace it was after Au
schwitz.  That, oh
, oh, we are so 
lucky that we are in Ber gen- Belsen because this
 will be really just a 
resort compared wi th

Ausc hwitz.  Res ort my foot!  It 
wasn't a resort.  By then it was pretty crowded.  It was quite 
crowded.  And the faciliti
es, I don't know what th
ey did with the bathroom
s and I don't know what 
they did with the lavatories an
d eve r ythi ng else  bec aus e I j ust
 don't reme mb er running water 
anymore.  An d I don't reme mb er la
trines .  I thi nk we were  using 
buckets.  Because I just don't  
remember that ther e 
wa s  bat hrooms or a nyt hing like t hat .  I f
 there were a ny t he y
 were not in our 
barra ck.  And at t hat ti me, I wa s, t he  barra ck t hat
 we were i n wer e n ot ju
st the Hungarian wo me n. 
There wer e Poli sh women 
and from all over and t h
ere were Czech women an
d there were di fferent  
nationalities.  There were 
no gypsies as I recall, but our barrac
k had women of all 
nationalities and I 
remember the three si
ster s fr om Pol a nd.  Car me lla  was t he ol
dest one, and then t here were, I don't  
re me mber the na mes of t he two other s, but one coul
dn't have been more t h an
 thirteen.  She was a 
skinny little thing and not 
very pretty.  And then there was th
e mi ddle sister who was quite nice  
looking and Carmella was just si
mply beautiful.  And Carme lla 
wa s very, very tal ent ed and she  
coul d dr a w bea uti full y a nd I don't know where sh
e got t he paper from, but 
the whole ti me , a nd s he  
had pencil , a nd the whol e ti me s he wa s dra wing 
and writ ing poe ms .  And 
I don't know whatever  
happened to them.  Carme
lla was t he fir st one t o die.  And I 
r e me mbe r  w a kin g u p in t he mor nin g 
and heari ng the younge r sister cri e
d, that Car mel - ka is dead, Car m
el-ka is dead!  And they were 
bot h s obbing and whini n g.  And t her
e were  man y  more  pe op l e  tha t  we
r e dead and when they died, 
we just dragged them outside.  An
d at that time there 
were still the commandos
 for the dead people  
and t hey would tie st raps to the 
wri s ts and t o their feet and t hey
 woul d drag the m.  Two people  
would drag each cadaver  to the ditc
h.  And t hen, t hree days lat er th
e mi ddl e sister  died.  And t hen  
the little one died probably
 a week later.  And I 
remember waking up
 in the morning and seeing the 
little one on all fours, sort of 
scrunched up and I think she went
 to the bathroo m, just being 
scrunched up li ke t hat .  And she 
wa s  de ad.  And we  dr agged her out .

Q: Wasit typhus? 
A: Typhus .  Now the 
li ttl e one di ed of t yphus a
nd Car me lla I t hink die d of typhus  and the e de ma . 

And t he  middle one  di ed, s he wasn

An d t h en  I r e me mbe r  thi s  o n e wo ma n, we  wo ke 
up i n t he mo rning a nd sh
e was on the  upper bunk  
and she was so swollen that 
she looked Japanese.  Her ey
es were just slits in he

 just was,  
this was somet hing that  was reall y amazing.  That
 it 's re all y not , I ca me
 across a medical repor t  
book i n Pol and, i n poli s h, 
and I tried to fi nd that
 syndrome  and I don't th
i nk it was ever r eall y 
descr ibe d.  So I don't know
, I didn't really research it very much
 but I woul d like t o spe nd s o me ti me 
in the li brar y a nd see  what, i f t he y have a nyt hing 
of that sort described. 
 But it was 
just amazing 
that, i f you woke up wit h you're e ye s s welli ng y

underst and j ust a good dose
 of di eteti c pr obabl y w

Q: Wh en was it that you a
rrived i n Bergen-Belsen? 
A: We  arri ve d in B e rge n- Bel sen a fter Ne w Ye ars , th
at wa s 1945.  I  thi nk it
 wa s Ja nuary 1st beca use  
it seems to me that when they 
were toasti ng a nd screa mi ng and 
yelli ng i t  was New Yea r s ' and I  
think that we arrived in Bergen-B
els en the ne xt day.  Somet i me l ate
 in t he eveni ng,
 late in the 
aft ernoon. 

Q: Di d you work at all while 
you wer e in Ber gen- Bel sen?  
A: No. We  didn't do anythi
ng.  We  didn't do anything
.  We  just sat there and 
we still had our bowls.  
The bowls were more precio
us than gold bec aus e i f you didn't  ha

not , you c oul dn't 
hol d s oup i n you're  hands .  Ma ybe  I,
 no, I don't  re me mber  
whether I, I t hink I wa

se e ms to me t hat ma ybe 
I did bec aus e I re me mbe r  

eating ra w potatoes be ca use we ha d no way of c ookin
g the m .  But I re me mber 
that I wa s sur prise d, 
I had never ate a raw potato before
, that it tasted a little bit like an
 apple without th
e apple taste,

exce pt t he t e xture  was  more li ke an a pple .  But, ma
ybe I did.  But  I j ust d
o n 't reall y re me mb er .  T h e 
whole time in Bergen-Belsen is ju
st  one big fog.  And 
one t hi ng ha ppe ne d and it  was  li ke a  mira cle  
beca use I wa s out side and I looke d 
up and there was Mrs. Gi -gen- ska
 (ph).  I saw Mrs. Gi -gen-ska 
(ph) and I t h ought I  die d.  And I wa
s  bac k in Krakow.  I  coul dn't belie
ve it.  And she di dn't have  her  
hair sha ve d or a nyt hing and she wa s  wit h her  
ca ne, she wa s li mping bec ause  s he ha d s o met hing 
wr ong wit h her l eg.  And s he 
ha d her ca ne  and she 
re cogni zed me.  Ac tually I rec o gniz ed her  
because she looked just li
ke she  di d.  She  was  bl o
nde  and she had s ort of wa
vy hai r  a n d s he ha d he r  
nice cl othe s on.  Not t he rags that we had.  And 
I looked at her and I call ed her _____________ a n d 
she re cogniz ed me of sor t s.  She c oul dn't beli eve 
t hat Anya (ph), Anya ( p
h) wa s my name , and we  
hugge d and we kiss ed a n d I wante d
 t o know what  she was doi ng ther
e .  And s he was i n a di fferent  
part of the  c a mp but  s he just ha ppe ne d t o be i n t h
at common area.  You see,
 we we re not  sta ndi ng  
up hill a nymore, we were  not counte d.  We just ki nd
 of exist ed.  And she was in a very good sha pe.  
And you know tha t e xce pt hugging wit h her a nd kiss ing her, I ha d no re c olle
ction anymore of wh at 
happened.  And I don't think I sa
w her again.  And not until three 
years ago when 
Rena Chic-kin-
ska (ph) , her  daughter , got my addr
ess.  Well actually no, she didn't ge
t my address.  Ch es-ruf (ph) 
wr ote t o Chi n-ut- sa 's ( ph) wi fe, I i ntr oduce d the m
 and t hey were boyfrie n d 
a nd girl fri end at some  
ti me , and Ches-ruf ( ph) s end me Rena
's letter.  Just like the Red Cros
s does.  If you wr ite to the Red  
Cross and you want an addr
ess of you're cousin so
mewhere , they won™t do 
it.  You gi ve t he m t he 
letter that you want you're cousin 
t o get and t he n t hey s end it t o you'r e cousin, a nd t he n  the cousi n 
deci des whet her he wa nts  to corres p
ond with you or not .  So Ches-r uf
 (ph) deci ded t he sa me thi ng. 
He  se nd me Re na 's le tter and he  sai d t hat Re na sa
id that she knew me fr om
 school and s he wa nte d  
to get in touch with me.  One of
 the reasons t hat she wanted t o 
get in touc h, she kne w that I was  
alive, at least that I wa
s alive in 1945 because he
r mot her  sa w me  i n Ber g
en- B else n.  You se e, I

coul dn't e ve n re me mber whether 
I saw her in Auschwitz 
or I sa w her in Berge n- Bels e n.  But Rena  
wrote t hat  I saw her i n Bergen-Bel
s e n a nd what  Re na wante d  was, s h
e went to Israel , they were not 
Jewish but she married a Jewish 
man after the war, a writer.  A 
play writer and a play critic i n  
Wa rsa w .  That 's anot her  story, but a nywa y s he we
nt to I srael and she wi
tnessed the Ad-va-shem 
(ph)  cere mo ny for t he  Righte ous.  
And she  thought t hat  maybe her 
mother was dead already, s h e 
died of a heart attack in I think 
1983 or 1982.  And she 
thought that her mot her
 was helping a lot of 
Je ws and a m ong t he m s h e was helpi n g my fa mily.  
That maybe I could wri t e a testi monial and s ee 
whether the y  coul d get a me dal for he r.  And s o I 
wr ote ba ck t o Rena a nd I  wa nted t o know mor e  
about her  mother  and she sai d t hat
 it wa s Bergen-Bel sen.  That wh
at  ha ppe ned was  her  mother  was  
helpi ng a l ot  of people a nd one 
of the m was s muggli ng weapons  to
 t he resistance or whatever it  
wa s.  And t h ey c aught  he r final l y.
  Just be for e the  Ausc hwitz  wa s to
 be e v acuat ed.  And they se nt 
her t o Auschwi tz and when the trai
n arrived, they decided they di
dn't  ne e d a ny more  prisoner s i n 
Auschwitz and they sent  her off 
t o Ber gen- Belsen.  And she was ju
st plain lucky because i f she 
arrive d i n Ausc hwitz t hr
ee weeks earlier or so she woul d have
 been put straig
ht into the gas 
cha mber wit h her l i mpi ng leg.  And this wa y s he  ha
d, e ven s he had her c ane wit h her , the y di dn't  
take it away fr om her.  And sh
e had still her normal clothes and 
she was never tatto
oed because the 
train arri ved, as Rena sai d, the tra i n a rrive d in Auschwitz a nd then her mot her was se nt  to Ber gen-
Belsen.  And she stayed in Berg
en-Belsen until, that I got all fr
om Rena, until Oct
ober because she 
did have t yphus t oo.  And so s he st a yed i n Berg e n-Belse n a n d the n she was se nt ba ck to Kr akow. 

So that 's  how Rena  kne w t hat  I was a
live, because her moth
er  saw me t her e. 
Q: You me ntioned that you had 
a bowl in Bergen-Belsen.  Di
d you bring it fr om Au schwitz? 
A: Oh , t he b owl  was fr o m Ausc h w
itz, the bowl was from
 Ausc hwitz, but I didn't  bri ng t he bowl.  I  
brought all kinds of othe

Q: We 're in Bergen-Belsen and you were telling me 
about you're seeing Mrs.
 Chi-chin-ska (ph) . 
You were te lling me a li ttle bit about afte r yo
u had seen he r and her 
daughter and you had t he  
corre sponde nce .  
A: Oh a nd a bout her daught
er , that she wr ote to me, and anyways 
to make this stor
y just complete, 
that I spent quite some time rememb
ering all of t he event s fr om the 
ti me  I deci ded t o get marri ed. 
Bec ause it  wa s Mr s. Chi-chi n-ska  ( ph)  that  re c o
mmended t hat I , t hat  Ya
nni ck and I  get  marri ed. 
And thi s wa y I can, s he  was a ve
r y  clever woman.  Sh
e r eally, she was di vorc ed, separ ated or 
divorce d from her husba nd a nd s he had this j e wel r y 
stor e.  And actually, a s 
I found out , it wa sn't, I  
just met her just after the war star
ted and I found out t hat t he s t ore r
eally was not hers .  It bel onged 
to a J e wis h woma n, a nd I ha ve her na me, I for get , bu
t she turned it over just like my father turned  
over his tannery t o the Mos-t o f-s ki (ph) fa mil y. 
 This woma n, Hele na I think wa s he r first na me , 
turne d ove r her s t ore  to Mrs. Chi-c hi n-ska ( ph) a
nd it  was Chi-chin-ska 's Per f umer y a nd Je welr y.  It 
wa s cost u me  jewelr y mai nly .  An d sh e was ru nn
i ng a ver y good business and s o meti mes she was  
payi ng s o me  of the profit s to the Je wi sh woma n. 
 And I don't know e xactl y what ha ppene d, i f sh e  
survi ve d the war or not , bu
t anyway this is what wa
s happe ning as far as Mr s .
 Chi-chin-ska (ph) was 
concerned.  And she had a lot of connecti ons and a 
lot of wisdom on how to 
run a busi ness.  And as 
I say, she helped our family to find pl aces to live as
 we had to keep on mo
ving, and then also we  
were selling some of the jewelry a
nd things a nd s he al wa ys got a ver y good pr ice for it and s old i t  
for us .  So I wr ote it al l up, about
 fourt een pages, very det ailed 
for Ya t-va-s ha m ( p h) and they  
accepted i t .  And actuall y , 
it was not j ust Mr s. Chi -chin-ska (ph) 
but Rena at that 
ti me was, she was 
just about a year younger  than I 
and s he wa s helpi ng t oo.  And one 
of the t hings t hat she was doi ng,  
you know t h at Doot -sie ( ph) and 
he r mother  were  givi ng t he Englis h 
lessons in their apartment, an d

Mrs. Chi-c hi n-ska ( ph) was in he
r st ore and Re na wa s di
r ecti n g the traffic of 
all  the st udent s.  She 
wa s sort of on the look-ou
t to make sure that there is no polic
e and t here i s no suspi cion, that ther e 
are pe opl e a r e comi ng a nd goi ng be caus e  the y had le
s sons e very hour of th
e hour .  So Rena was 
very muc h i nvolve d in t his whole business t oo. 
 So t he y both wer e re cognize d a n d I ha ve a 
photograph of Re na re ce ivin
g the me dal, for her a nd he r mother.  
And a certifi cate, so t hey got it a 
year ago.  So that 's t he story of
 Mrs . Chi-c hin-s ka (ph) .  Oh, an
d she said that her mother came 
home fr om Ber gen- Belsen emaci ated
 and sick, but s he rec o vere d ver y
 fast and then they lived in 
Kra kow for some ti me  a nd s he died
 of a heart att ack i n church.  
One Sunday t hey 
we nt to Mass a nd 
she died.  So I t hink she was i n he
r late 80's, so Re
na was at peace. 
Q: You ca me down with typhus as we
ll while you were in
 Bergen-Belsen? 
A: Yes.  And actually that probab
ly somewhat mi ght have
 saved my life .  Be
cause when the British 
ca me, I wa s just rec overi ng fr om typhus .  I ha d e de m
a but it wa s not as progre ssi ve as  the ones t ha t  

killed people in three days.  I re
memb er crawling on my hands and kn
ees because my legs were so 
swollen, it wasn't just
 my a nkle s but I t hink t h ey wer e s w o
llen all the way to 
my  knees.  And my  
hands were swol len.  But someho
w my eyes and my face wer en't as
 bad.  And I reme
mber I bar el y  
coul d wal k.  And t here wer e  t wo or
 three steps i nto t he barrack.  I 
thi nk t he barrac ks 
were not on a 
foundation, but on s
tilts.  And I know that I cr
awled up and I just barely 
could walk.  Now we are 
coming ver y  close to t he liberati on now.  Because I 
started, t hat that save d my li fe , that I did ha ve  
typhus, because I had no ap
petite.  I know that I hadn'
t eaten anything for se
veral days.  I know I 
wa s ver y thi r sty a nd I just don't r e me mber that 
there was water available.
  I know people can't liv e  
wit hout wat e r, but  I j ust don't  re me mber ha ving a
ny water to drink.  And 
we knew that something 
wa s going on be cause we could he
a r shooting, and he avy 
s hooting.  And i t  see m
ed to me like there 
were air raids all the time because the sirens were 
goi ng.  And the  guar ds  see me d t o be sort  of not

payi ng muc h  attenti on t o us a nd we
 di dn't get any food. 
 An d I don't reme mber how long it was that 
we didn't get  any food.  And then
 when we woke up in the mo rni
ng t her e we re no guards.  And I  
remember crawli ng out and seei
ng people runni ng t o war ds the gate s a n d the gates  wer e ope n.  
The r e wer e big, wooden ga
tes.  They were not barb
ed wire gates, they were wooden gates.  And 
there were big wooden posts.  And t here were no
 guar ds, and in the towers there were no guards , 
anywhere.  And we couldn't believe
 it.  And then the first tank came
 in.  And they 
were British. 
The y ha d ba rrettes  and t he Ge r mans did not we ar  be
r ets .  And the y ha d ki nd of gre eni sh uni for ms ,  
not the blue- gree n but the yellow- gre en.  They ha d jack
et s.  I coul dn't beli eve it.  I don't think that I  
coul d belie ve either.  I forgot t o 
tel l you what t he camp l ooked like 
by t he n .  First of all ,  there  were  
dea d pe ople all over t he place .  And t here was , I do
n't want to use the ba d 
word, but t h ere was shit  
all over  because everybody had di ar rhea or  there wa
s  no, the y c oul dn't get 
to the latrine and they 
just did i t  where ever  they st
ood.  And you c o uldn't 
eve n wal k.  And there was, I  don't know 
whether it i s  recorde d or  not , but
 there was canni balism go
ing on.  I remember. 
 It  was before the 
Briti sh t anks .  For  se veral  da ys when we didn't ge
t  any food or anyt hing a n
d I sa w pe opl e wi th t heir

[Tape parti al l y er ased her e] 

 

A: Pe ople were dyi ng all over a nd the y wer e just c ada vers all over the pl ace .  And I pr obably s hould  

say de ad pe ople.  And the y, the Ger ma ns, that was 
befor e the Ger mans escape

so when the British came, the place 
was just absolutely covered with
 dead people.  Just piles of 
the m.  Some  of t he m wer e  pile d 
up and some of the m we
re just  scatter ed ar ound, ever ywhere .  And  
people just defecati ng and relieving t hemsel ves ri ght 
where they stood.  It wa
s just hor rible.  And, 
and be fore t hat, t her e was thi s on
e t i me, a few weeks befor e that , 
whe n  they dr owned a girl in a 
buc ket of soup.  You know, t he y w
oul d bring the, t hat was whe n th
e y were still cooki ng for us.  The 
soup was  tur nips or pota t oes or wh
ate ver.  And they br ought  it  in 
and people were s o hungry t hat  
they were s t or ming at it  and pu
shi ng and pul ling a nd one of t he  wome
n leaned over and t hey pushed 
her, j ust ri ght into t he bucket of soup.  And s he c o ul
dn't get out.  The re st wer e di ppi ng.  I , I, I , she 
drowned. 

Q: You de sc ribed seei ng the sol die
r s coming.  You 
knew t he y wer en't Ger ma n.  Did you know tha t  
they were British? 

A: Yes.  We knew that  
they, because I  sai d t h at they looked
 di ffer ent .   I  don't r e member  the 
mar kings on the tanks or  anyt hing, 
or the cars, or the trucks, but th
e y ha d di ffere nt uni f or ms .  They 
had round s ort of ca ps a nd the y ha d jacket s.  An
d they drove  into the ca mp a nd st opped the truc ks  
and people who c oul d wal k or r un just s war me d th
e m t he guys reall y had t o pr ote ct the ms elve s. 
The y ha d ci garett es and they ha d c hoc olate bar s and they wer e throwi ng the m a nd peopl e we r e 

killing themselves for t h at, and so
 they stopped because 
peopl e wer e just k
illing each other t o get  
hol d of t he chocolat e.  And I j ust don't re me mb er 
what ha ppened e xac tl y, but it  see ms  to me  that  
mo re an d mo re o f the m ca me a n d so me ho w  the 
people that were well 
enough, more of the 
newco mers, like Mrs. Chi-chin-ska 
(ph) wa s one of the newcomers, I 
think those were 
t r ying t o put  
some kind of an order in
to the place and put us ba
ck into the barracks until mo
re soldiers came in so 
that they could some how control 
the crowds .  And t he fi
rst thing that they 
di d, t he y ope ned the 
kitchen and t hey cooke d t his food. 
 They brought out big 
barrel s of t he food that t he y cooke d a nd it

wa s s o me ki nd of Briti s h rati ons t ha t  were j ust  a  
fant astic  ste w wit h big ch
unks of salt, pork or  
whatever, it was fat.  And it was ju
st abs olute ly s mell i ng delic iousl y and peopl e just went craz y and 
they really had to push them ar
ound to be able to ration this 
stuff out.  And I 
reme mber getting a 
bowl of it and eating it with my fi
ngers and I think I took 
one mout hful and I c oul
dn't s wall o w it .  I  
just couldn't eat anything.  I just got
 si ck to my st oma ch and I just le
ft the bowl there and I just didn't 
care.  I  remember  crawl ing back
 int o t he barr ack and Betsy coul
dn't  eat  either.  Bet sy also had  
typhus a nd s he, we both cried b
eca us e we were s o hungr y and we 
just wanted water.  There was 
plent y of wa ter to dri nk t oo.  Th
ey ha d cups and we c oul d dri nk.  
But we coul dn't eat .  But t here  
were a lot of people who were just
 gorging themselves with
 t hat st uff.  And t hey wer e all dead the 
next day.  They al l got diarrhea 
and t hat pl ace was really t hen horri
ble.  Because th
ey had diarr hea 
in the barrack, they had diarrhea ev
er ywhere .  And evidentl y t he y c oul
dn't e a t that  ki nd of food and 
that ca use d t he dia rrhe a.  And pe ople  were j ust si
ck all over .  The y were t hrowi ng up and t hat was  
probabl y worse tha n a nyt hing else . 
 And by then, it seems to me lik
e t he medical Corp ar rived.  And 
they cooked up big dr ums  of water y
 cer eal, sor t of a crea m of wheat
 or  somet hing, but it  mos tly 
looked li ke wat ery st uff.  And they gave us t hat 
t o eat and I remember I at
e that, I think it was more 
like drinking.  I dra nk about t wo c ups  
of it , but a l ot of us thought t hat
 that wasn't food
 really and we 
wer e e xpl ained t hat our st omac hs wer e not use  to t h
e ri ch food and we had t o 
slowly get adjusted.  I 
remember the next 
portion was a little bit thicke
r until we fi nally got grue
l, which is the normal  
thickness, but for at least three days
.  And then also there was bread in
 storage but we didn't get it.  I 
mean, the Ger mans 
woul d not give us the  br ead but t he  Briti
sh fi nall y opene d the st or es a nd the y  
found t her e wa s pl ent y of bre ad, whi ch t hey ne ve r 
distr i buted.  So we  di d ge
t brea d.  And more  and 
more British came and they starte
d cleaning up the camp.  But the 
main thing was that the Germans 
coul d not, a lot of t he m did not e sca pe.  And t h
e y hi d in t he ca mp a nd t h e Comma nder, Kra me r , I  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
98 
 
 
think wa s hi s na me, he wa s caught .  And the woma
n, I for ge t  her na me , the Ge r man woma n, the  
mai n wo ma n  that was ta k i ng ca re 
of the wo me n's camp , sh
e was caught too.  And many others .  But 
Kramer wa s the on e and the wo ma n 
was  the  ot her one  tha t  we  were  al l che ering, t hat t hey got 
caught.  And then what the 
British did that I ne
ver forget either, they had 
the German soldiers pil e  
the c orpses  up i n tr uc ks  and they
 had Kra me r  t ake his shirt  off 
and lay naked at the top of the 
corpses .  And drive , t he y  dr ove  to
 the  bi g ditches  and burie d t he pe opl
e .  And I know that t he  truc ks 
wer e going bac k a nd for t h, and back
 and forth, wit h all  the dead pe
ople.  I don't k
now, I heard the 
fi gur e that t h ere were like  30,000 or s o  that were 
de ad.  And the n the y were cleani ng up t he bar r ac ks 
and cle ani ng up the whol e ca mp.  
And then I have a vague recollect
io n o f  what wa s 
going on, but I 
know that t hey had a scale and I 
guess the Bri tish doct
or s, the y wer e wei ghi ng us  and ta king 
photographs .  And I re me mb
er I weighed 71 pounds.  I didn't kno
w what pounds wer e, I just kne w  
kilograms, but th
ey were  wei ghi ng us in pounds. 
Q: Ho w t a ll wer e  yo u?  
A: 5'1".  And, oh, but I know we 
got food.  That after a while we 
got bread and we 
got still a kind of 
not very thick soup and 
not much meat, but evidently very nu
tritious food becaus
e it seems to me 
like I gained wei ght , maybe fi ve pounds in the fir st  
mo nths or s o.  That wa s April 14, 1945 whe n the  
gate opened. 
Q: Had you r ecovere d fr om typhus at t hat poi nt?  

A: By then I was quite re covered.
  I didn't have fe ver and I wa s 
recovered from t yp
hus .  And I wa s,  
except for the swelling, wh
ich was going away, 
and I was getting stronger after I had the food and I 
wa s fe eling better  and be tter.  And 
it took about maybe tw
o we eks for me to sort
 of recuperate.  An d 
I was getting back my appetite.  But t he main thi n g 
was that because I had typhus I didn't have any 
appetite and I didn't eat th
e gruel, the rich fo od th
at they gave us.  And th
en the big thing was that  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
99 
 
 
they de-l ous ed us .  But t hey r eally de-louse d us
 wit h DDT.  The sys t e m wa s that t he y ha d the s e  
pumped up, you know t he c ont ai
ne r s with the  pump, a nd we ha d t o open our pa nti es a nd the y  
sprinkle d t he  stuff and be hind, i nto
 our dresses and into sleeves, an
d everywhere , a nd our hair .  We  
didn't know that DDT was quit e toxi
c, but not only for the lice but 
for people, but I think at that 
poi nt, nobody care d wha t  was t oxic. 
 The ma in t hi ng was t hat we c oul
d se e  the lice j ust die, ri ght on 
the s pot .  So that wa s one of t he gr
eat things that they di
d for  us.  And we fi nall y got ri d of the lice .  
But  I  ne ver  forget  the DDT tr eat me nt. 
End of  Side A of  Tape 6. 
Q: Oka y.  Mrs. War e, will
 you tell what happened 
to Betsy at this point?
  Where was she in the 
camp?  Did she s
till have typhus?  
A: We ll when we were liberated, 
she was still sick and 
she was getting worse. 
 She couldn't eat 
anyt hing a nd they opene d  the hos p
ital .   I mean, the  Briti sh ope ned 
the hospital and so that's where 
she we nt a n d I would go and vi sit her.  But t he n
 she recover ed from typ
hus but she evidentl y ha d 
tuberculosis and so she was 
in the hospital the rest of
 the time.  Until I left .  
So I just went to visit 
her a nd I j us t don't know what ha ppe ned to her .  
I sear ched i n  the books a
nd the only thing that I  
found was a recor d of us being in Ber gen- B else n th
e fi rst time.  But under the column of diseased , 
there wa s just bla nks .  So I ha ven't, a nd then I 
s ea r che d ot her books a nd I 
have not found her na me  
anywhere else. 
Q: Will you describe you're memo
ries of the British.  Di
d you have any particul
ar recollections of 
relations? 

A: Not a lot because, first of all,
 we wer e absolut ely over whel med. 
 I mean we just couldn't believe 
it.  It  took a whi l e t o s ort of si nk 
int o our brai ns t h at we didn't have 
to be up in the 
morning for a roll 
call, that we didn't have to be scar ed, that we we
re going to get food, t h at we were alive .  That  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
100 
 
 
maybe even we had a fut ure
.  And e v erybody was  abs olute ly j ust 
wonder ful to us .  The y  had t ons of  
chocolat e and cigarettes and t hey j ust, they were
 all for, I mean ci garettes and chocolates an d 
anyt hing el se was j ust for the as
ki ng.  And t he y took a  
lot of phot ogra phs a nd I re me mb er that  the y  
did wei gh me and phot ograph 
me , j ust  on t he st reet .  It was nothi
ng officia l .  And I 
wa s a bout 70 or  
71 pounds, I was really skinny.  
And still in the horrible 
clothing because they 
didn't have anything 
else to gi ve us.  And I t h ink we eve nt ually got 
some bette r cl othi ng a nd I 
don't know wh ether they 
brought them in fr om some
 war ehouses or where ver, but I know t h
at I di d not wear the dress t hat I  
came in fr om Au schwitz, when my 
cousin took me.  So it s
e e ms to me that at one poi nt I, see t hings  
went so fast  and there i s
 a one big blank of sorts,
 of the detailed day by 
day activities, but I know 
that one  thi n g happened.  And it wa
s  short l y a fter the li berat i on whe n I  wa s feeli ng be tt er.  It mi ght  
have been maybe two weeks later, 
maybe more, that I joined an ex
cursion into the 
village.  And a 
lot of people were going into the adjoining villa
ges and bringing 
fo od and clothing and it seems t o  
me that  that 's wher e I got the dr
ess that I was wearing later on.  
And I  re me mber goi ng i nto one  of  
the house s.  The y were a ll abandoned, there we
re no, t hese we re all Ger ma n house , and it looke d 
like people left  in a gr
ea t hur ry.  And I r e me mber going i nt o
 one of the hous
es and there was 
silver ware a nd a Lika  ca mer a a nd I a l wa ys was very
 fond of Lika came ras,
 I  ha d one and I had to  
leave it behi nd in Kra kow whe n we wer e de port e d.  So
 I wa s just thril l ed wi
t h the Lika camera.  I 
don't know what I was go
ing to do with it, but 
somebody found a pillow cas
e and we started to put 
the t hings , you know t he re were  s o me table c l ot hs
 and na pki ns and silver wa
re and the Li ka ca mera, 
and so we were putti ng t hos e t hings
 in pillow cases.  And then so
me body we nt down t o the c ellar or  
the ba se me nt and c alled us.  And the r e wer e about fo
ur women, t here we re four of us  at that ti me , 
and s o we went down.  And ther e were sausages
 and ha ms a nd a side of
 por k, I mean, there was  
food t hat we haven't seen for ag
es and it was j ust  ha ngi ng from ra
fters and I think that's they wa y

usually food was prese r ved.  It was al l s moke d and pr
es erved and t hen j ust  hanging dry.  Out we nt  
the silver and the Lika a
nd everything else, out of
 the pillow cases, and we 
loaded it all up with as  
much food as we could ca
rry, and we we nt ba ck t o  
the camp and we shared it 
wit h ot her people .  At  
that time we could 
already eat normal fo od.  
And we still were hungry all 
the time even
 though we 
coul d get as much food as we want
ed.  It see ms to me t hat the kitchens were goi ng da y and night.  
And we di d not have t o s t and i n line .  The y set up ta
bles in sor t  of c a feteri a  style and we sat at the  
tables and at e.  And it wa
s just such a  cha nge t hat i t  wa s e xtr
e m ely di ffic ult for us to gra sp it a nd to  
really know that it is a
ll for real.  Every ti me 
I thought , well , you know, 
we were dre a mi ng about  
being free and going 
out and doing things
.  And I thought I 
was still dreami ng.  And we were jus t  
living in a completely unreal worl
d.  And then one da y, I me t a young 
soldier, British 
soldi er.  And 
he was very, very nice.  He spok
e a little bit German a
nd I didn't speak much 
English, but he was  
very frie ndl y and we wer e not s up
pose to fr ater nize, or they weren'
t suppose to fr aternize with the  
prisoner s, s o  we were j u st hol ding hands and goi
ng for a wa lk.  And t he n 
he sai d that, he wa s a  
drive r  for one of the offic ers, for a n ol der man. 
 And some how I me t his superior and he found out  
that I  c oul d spea k severa l language s and he  tal ke d 
to me  and he said, he ha
s a  job for me .  I shoul d 
go to t he hospital a nd a l so in t he sa me buil ding, or 
the building next to it, ag
ain I don't, these were 
all offi cer 's quart ers t hat  the Ger mans lived in, and 
of course they were all 
aba ndone d.  He t old me  
to go and he wrote it on a piece of paper s to wh
om I shoul d ask for, and 
I went there and they  
interviewed me.  An
d they thought that I woul
d be j ust per f ect for wor k ing i n a  rec ords  room,  
answeri ng questi ons to peopl e who 
ar e comi ng i n looking fo
r relatives and looking for other people. 
So I thought this would be kind of
 ne a t .  And ma ybe that 's whe n th
e y ga ve me a di ffer e nt dre ss and 
I just don't quite reme mb er
.  But , oh, somet hing el se happe ned be
for e t hat  phase .  I went  on a not her  
exc ursi on int o the vi llage and we we nt  very ea rly 
in the morning, it was still 
very dark.  And we got  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
102 
 
 
there and the first hous e that we came to was locked
 up s o we  coul dn't get  
i n.  So we went around 
looking for a  way t o get i n a nd I  kn
ow it was not proper to do it, but at
 t hat point we di dn't care .  We  
just wa nte d t hings a nd we wante d t o, I don't know 
why, well, it wasn't calle
d ste aling, it  
was call ed 
orga nizi ng.  And in the c a m
p that was the word I l
earne d, that it wa sn't ste a ling, you j us t  orga niz ed 
to get t hi ngs  and t o j ust  have t h
ings.  So we we nt ar
ound a n d I  he ard, se e 
I li ve d i n t he countr y  
be for e I was  arreste d, a n d I hear d 
sort of a fa mil i ar sound, bi rds or s o met hing, s o I was wit h t wo  
other  wome n.  And we followe d t he  
sound a nd t here was a  c oop with
 a goose i nsi de .  A big, fa t  
goose .  We ll , that was  more
 t han we coul d bear .  
I mean, t hat was 
the mos t  bea uti ful si ght .  And I  
stuc k my ha nd i n and the 
goose bit my finger , you know t he y 
snap.  And I grabbe d her by t he nec k  
and I coul d pull her out , I mea n s he wa s fighting me
.  I t  was  a fe mal e  goose I  thi nk beca use  we  
found eggs inside, I mean inside
 the goose, because I had my little 
knife, I told you 
about the knife 
that I had.  I did an awful thing.  I cut the goos
e's head off with the little 
knife and it took a while. 
[Laughing].  It was awful.  But,
 I me an, havi ng s een all t he blood 
and all the dead bodies, I mean 
just cutting a goose head was not th
at bad, I think.  Bu
t today I think it was aw
ful and I don't know 
wh ether I should laugh or cry, but we  pulled the g
oos e out a nd we t hre w t h e hea d back in.  And we  
were walking back draggi
ng the goose and then 
we were thinking what 
will happen if
 the people  
come ba ck a nd the y wi ll  just fi nd the head.  Ma
ybe they wa nted to have  the goose a nd the other  
girls were sa ying, for get it.  Nobody wa s worr ied about you.  We 
have t h e goos e a nd we sat in a 
ditch and we  plucke d t he fe athe rs. 
 It t ook about a n  hour a nd the 
down a nd t he fe at
hers were flying 
all over  the place.  And then we 
t ook the goose  bac k to
 the camp.  That  was 
before the kitchens 
were all set up properly an
d before we were ge
tting the food in the cafe te
ria style.  We  still were 
cooking outside on the little
 s ort of st ove s a nd in our
 bowl s.  I  mea n, not  st ove
s but on an ope n fi re. 
Anywa y, I  don't t hink I  ate t he g
oose.  I don't think I could eat
 it, but  ever ybody wa s gorgi ng 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

the mse lve s.  I thi nk t he y  bar bec ued of s orts bec a u
se they baked it on the, they cut it up and they 
baked it on top of the fi re
, and I know I couldn't eat it.
  But to this day, I can'
t forget killing that poor 
goose .  So a nywa y, so t h at was be
for e.  And t hen I went t o ge t th
e job and they told me it was all 
right so I, they told me I will not be in the camp anymore.  I mean
, stay in the barr
acks anymore but 
I will have my own room 
with a real bed.  And 
they told me where the 
room will be so I went  
upstairs and sure enough there wa
s a bed and there was a mattress and there wa
s a pillow, but there 
were no sheets and no blankets.  An
d I thought, well, I supp
ose maybe they will gi
ve me something. 
So t he n I found out t hat t here wa
s a s upply r oom downst
airs.  I don't know wh
ether I s h oul d tell you 
this story because I told it to
 my children and they said
, well , you ha ve to tell.  
[rest of following 
sentence accident ally de
leted fr om testimony] 
study.  So, I c o uld r ead 
English much 
better than I 
coul d s pea k.  And, you s ee I didn't  
know the pronunciation, so I we nt
 downstairs and I tried to tel l  
the m t hat I need s o me be ddi ng.  
But t hey couldn't underst and what 
I wa nt ed a nd I said, "t wo shit s  
for my bed - two shits".
  The y al most died!   Oh, they kept  on
 a s king me  and they
 were just laughing 
and I ke pt on repeati ng and they were l aughing so
me mor e.  Wel l , fi nall y the y kne w what  was goin g 
on, t hat the pronunciati o n wa s, you know?   Sheet  or 
shit or whate ver, it 's all the sa me to me.  Well  
anyway, they gave me the 
bedding and that was the fi
rst  ti me in over a year  I sl ept  i n a real  bed. 
Wit h a bla n ket.  Covere d with a bl a nket cover a
nd a  sheet a nd a  white s heet
, was he d , clea n, and a 
pillow with a pillowcase. 
 And I couldn't sleep.  The mattress 
was not like I was use to, but still it  
wa s not the floor .  It was ma ybe a st
ra w or maybe a thin bla nke t, and 
this is something I don't think I 
will  ever for get.  So thi s  was 
my  room.  And it seems 
to me that I got some
 underwear and I got 
some, a change of cl othes because I know t hey wanted
 me to be dres sed up. 
 And I ha d a badge with 
my na me on it.  I t hi nk t hey to
ok my photogra ph too.
  So I worked there 
and many people wer e  
coming and aski ng for  relatives
 a nd, you know, people wer e
 wande ring and wandering a nd

wa ndering fr om other camps and, I don't know, but 
there wer e a lot of peopl
e coming.  Even fr om 
our ca mp.  People  were  comi ng t hat  we re s epar a te
d when t h ey arr i ve d a nd t he y wanted t o know.  
So I was busy.  I 
was mainly sitting there looki
ng through the fi les and, I 
don't know, somebody else 
was preparing the 
files.  And I was still kind 
of seeing this young man wh
o decided he 
was in love 
wit h me a nd he wa nts t o mar r y me
.  Well, t her e was no 
such thing.  There was 
no frat e r nizati on and 
you could not marry anybody. 
 And s o he tal ke d t o his bos s and 
what was happe ning too is that t he  
officer, I don't know whether he wa
s a Ge neral or some body wh o was 
in charge of that particular 
division and the young man 
was his driver.  As 
a matter of fact, I still have
 his photograph.
  I didn't  
bring it with me but there it is, "T
o my bel ove d Anna" .  And he sa
id, so t he ol der ma n, the Briti s h  
officer , wa nt ed to know whether he c oul d take, r e
ally get me out of the 
camp.  We ll th
ere was no 
wa y he coul d.  And he had a da ughte r  about my a ge an
d he jus t coul dn't see  leaving me there .  So he  
said, now do you have a n y rel ative s
?  No , I don't have an
ybody.  Not that I  kno
w of.  And he sai d, 
well , not in Pol and but ma ybe you 
have s o mebody in Ameri ca?   I said, oh yes , in America.  I ha ve  
an Uncl e in Ameri ca.  Well they 
se nt us, one ti me  they s ent us  
a package from Amer
ica, when we 
were still in Krakow.  Where in 
America?  New York. 
 Wh ere in New York? 
 Wh at do you mean, 
wh ere i n Ne w York?   In  Ne w York!   I did n 't  k no w
 t hat , my geogr aphy, Ameri ca n ge ography was n 't 
very good.  I didn't know
 there was New York St at
e and New York t hat is 
Brooklyn and Manhattan, 
and whate ve r .  He s ays, Okay, Ne
w Yo rk .  Well  the Re d Cro ss was 
t her e already and 
they, he gave 
all the information to th
e Re d Cross.  This , Aar o n Chil- o-vit c
h (ph), Ne w York.  
S o th e Re d Cro s s  
got the information an
d they, I don't know whethe
r they cabl ed to my Uncl
e or whether t hey wrot e a  
letter, I have  no idea .  But my Un
cle wa s noti fi e d that Anna Fa yno c l ai
ms t o be hi s niec e.  No, als o,  
Ne w York, the wa y t he y found Aa
r on Chil-o- vi tch ( ph) in Ne w 
York wa s they l o oke d i n the  
Brooklyn telephone book, that's 
whe r e all t he Je ws li ve d.  And 
t here was no Aaron Chi l-o- vitch 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
105 
 
 
(ph) .  So t he next  thi ng is Manhatta n.  And t h
ere  was Aar on Chil-o-vit ch 
(ph), the only Aaron Chil-
o-vitc h (ph), its not the very usua
l name in Ame rica.  On Wall Stre
e t .  So they got i n touc h with 
hi m, t hat Anna Fayno is in Berg
en- B elsen and she says she i s  you'
r e nie ce .  And he sa id, I don't  
know any Anna Fa nyo. 
 And t hen he deci de d, t a lking to my 
Aunt, that  I did get mar r i ed.  They 
remembered because they 
had a daughter  the same 
age.  And they 
r e me mb ere d  t h at 
their da ught er  
got ma rried at ninetee n and I got 
married at ni neteen.  So t hey 
deci de d that ma yb
e this is my 
mar r ied na me.  And my cousin, th
eir  son, was in the Ameri c an ar
my.  And he was  s e nt, he wa s  
suppose to, I me an, everything is
 fate, you know?  He was also 
spea ki ng se veral l angua ges a nd he  
wa s a ver y good linguis t and he ha
d put hi m i n a Japa ne se s chool to le ar n Japane se a nd he was 
suppose to go to J apa n.  And s o me body ca me down wi
t h mea sles i n his di vision s o the y quara ntine d  
them.  And by the time
 they, it was time  fo r th
e m to go, t he  other divi si
on l e ft and t hese  people 
stayed, so they decided th
ey will send him to 
Germany after all.  And one 
of his jobs was to go fr om 
ca mp t o ca mp in the Ame r ican z one to look for 
t he SS me n a nd the guar ds 
a nd the comma ndants o f 
the c a mps  who wer e hi dden a mong th
e pris oners .  And he, that  wa s 
hi s job, and he was s t ationed i n  
Leipzig.  And so my Uncl
e cabled t o  hi m, for at t hat ti me t h
er e wa s no t e l e x, but a nywa y, he sai d 
there is an Anna Fayno in
 Bergen-Bel sen, check it  
out.  Maybe that 's  Neu
r-rev (ph) beca
use that 's 
my Russia n na me , Anna  is Neur-r ev
 (ph).  So  he got a jeep and 
a  drive r  and t he y procee de d t o  
Ber ge n- Bels en.  And the y arrive d in Ber ge n- Bels e
n and he wante d to know whet her a nybody kne w  
Anna Fa yno and nobody kne w Anna  Fayno.  And fina
lly they told him to go 
to the file with the 
dea d pe opl e beca use  we do kee p a fil e on all t he peop
le t hat died i n camp 
and t here wer e many of 
the m t hat die d a ft er the li berati on, s o ma ybe you c an 
fi nd her  t here .  So, he 
went t o the offi ce and he  
walks in and he walks up to my  de
s k a nd he  sa ys, i n Poli sh, he st
arted to say, to
 ask about Anna 
Fayno, a nd he grabbe d me and starte d to kiss me
 a nd e verybody in the offic e kne w t hat , you know,  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
106 
 
 
there was s o me ha nky pa nky going o
n, but you know?   In t he  dar k of
 the evening or something, but 
not i n the middle  of t he day, in 
the  mi ddle  of t h e offic e.  So, he 
crie d a n d I cri ed, I i m me diat ely 
recogniz ed hi m too in spi t e of t he uni for m, and he 
recogniz e d me .  Eve n thoug
h my hai r  was not the  
same and my face was not
 t he same, but he di d recognize me
.  So everybody start ed jumpin g 
around a nd c rying a nd la ughing a nd, anywa y, I t h i
nk he  got more ma rria ge  proposals  that da y t ha n  
he eve r  did, exce pt that he had a bi g band on his 
hand, he wa s marr ied alr ead
y.  But he didn't even  
stay over night ther e.  He put me
 on t he, I me an he just si gne d some pa per s and got rel ease d and he  
put me  on hi s jee p a nd he  says, "what  is thi s? "  
 We ll I ha d a  bundle  with me
 and these were the t wo 
British blankets from my
 bed.  Th ey were beautiful, soft w
ool and I wasn't goi ng t o lea ve  the m  
there.  So, and a couple of
 my treasures incl
uding the little knife.  So an
yway, I wouldn't part with  
the stuff s o he sai d, " All  r ight , le t '
s go."  And we dr
ove  to Frankfurt. 
Q: Be fore we go on I ha ve a fe w 
questions a bout Ber ge n- Bel sen.  Did you ha ve a  de s i re to l eave  
after the liberation?  Di
d you have ideas of wher
e  you would li ke t o go?  
A: I had absolutely no ideas.  I th
ought that first I would try to find
 whether anybody is alive.  And 
actually I don't think that I 
was thinking very clea
rly.  I think that I was just
 enjoying the 
fact that I 
was ali ve.  That  I had as 
much food as I c oul
d possi bly eat .  I ate  all t he  t i m
e.  I don't want to tell  
you how much weight I 
gained.  But  I didn't bri n g that pi ctur e,
 but ther e is a picture of me hal f a  

year late r on the shi p, and you woul dn't believe that
 it coul d have be en the  sa me pers on.  I double d  
my wei ght  a l most .  And I jus t  e njo
ye d t he fact, or  relis he d t he fa ct t h
at I was alive.  That I could do 
al most  anyt hing that  I wanted to do
.  And I  just, I sa w Mr s.
 Chi-chin-ska (ph) seve
ral times, so that's 
how everybody in Kr akow knew that
 I was aliv e.  Yo u k no w , wh en 
s he we nt bac k.  She  we nt ba ck 
in October .  And I just li ved i n a real , un-re al wo
rl d.  And it wa s just a s i f I pus he d eve r ythi ng out of 
my mi nd a n d at that ti me I didn't ev
e n think that i t  was re al.  I  didn't
 think that, I felt
, well, I'm just

drea mi ng.  I 'll wake up a nd it will  
be all over.  So it was really like 
li vi ng fr om day to da y a nd I j ust  
coul dn't get  use  to the  fa ct 
that it  was all r eal .  Does 
that answer you're question?  
Q: No w yo u 're sa yin g th at this 
young man who fel l  in 
love wit h you, you di
dn't share that same 
fe eling inside? 
A: Oh no, no, not at all .
  I mean, fir st  of all we
 couldn't communic ate very 
well .  I me an, you know, 
my  English and his German
 j ust didn't ji ve .  But  you know, we
 sat and he wa s te
lling me things 
about Engl a nd a nd I di dn't quite understa nd what  he
 was sa yi ng, but j ust be
ing with s o mebody and 
hol ding s o mebody's ha nd and j ust s o mebody tel li
ng you tha t  he r eally l ove s me a n d tha t  I a m 
wonder ful  a nd t hat I  a m  bea uti ful .  I t  wa s just 
about enough.  And I don't 
know wha t  I wa nte d.  I 
really don't know wher e I want ed to go and what 
I want ed.  And, I mean, i f
 I was looki ng bac k now  
and maybe analyzing it, the best de
finition I can say is th
at I was a little bit out 
of my head.  And my  
cousin thought I was a little bit out 
of my head evidentl y because t hat
's what he told
 hi s fa mily.  I  
don't know that he wrot e to th
em or what, but they expected 
some body that was not quite all  
toget her .  The way t hey wer e treat
i ng me and the wa y, but he put me 
on the jeep and th
ey had t he . .

 I me an, anybody.  I 
know he was a high-ra
nking officer in the 
British army, but I don't ev
en know his name.  And ne
ver tried to fi nd out.  
You see, half the time I 
tried t o for g et e veryt hi ng.  And not
 tried to think.  And th
is is the first time th
at I'm really looking 
through any kind of rec or ds and doing a thorough s e
arch.  Ot her wis e, I al wa ys sai d, well , ma ybe I 'll  
do it tomorr ow.  Maybe beca use I di dn
't want to find out that I can't 
fi nd a n ythi ng out.  So, are we in 
the j eep now or  are we sti ll in Bergen- Bel sen?  

Q: We  ca n go t o
 t he j eep now. 
A: Okay.  So, in the jeep my co
usin ha d, I gue s s these  were  the  
K-rations.  And he always wa s 
telling my Aunt and Uncle 
that he couldn't believe 
it.  But the K ration wa
s supposed to last a 
soldi er a whole day.  And I at e five
 of them!  And then we stopped 
for the night.  
I don't reme mb er 
exactl y where, but  it was some ki
nd of a guesthouse or whatever
.  And t he n we  we nt on to  
Frankfurt.  And he evi d ently alre
ady knew about  the pl ace or  what becau
se we went straight ther e.  
It was a house which belonged to 
some Ger man officer who, as my co
usi n said, wa s in a sa fe plac e 
now.  I mea n, he was j a i l ed alr
ead y.  An d h i s wi fe  wa s 
a very nice la dy who sai d s he wi ll take good  
care of me.  And she did.  She cooked 
whatever I wanted to. 
 I think at 11 o'cloc
k at ni ght I woke up 
and I wante d potat o pa ncake s and s h e cooked pot ato
 pa nca kes  for me .  Ther
e was one thing that I 
disc ove red i n her hous e is that her bas e ment was full,
 and I mean full , wit h cas
es of Re d Cross food.

Her  husband was a commandant  i n
 a , s o me kind of a s m all pri s
on camp or Jewish camp, or 
whatever it was.  I  don'
t know which one.  And 
all these Red Cross packag
es wer e endi ng up in 
their base me nt.  I was s h ocked.  I tol d, you s ee I 
wa s visit e d by my, my cous
in had t o l eave beca use  
he ha d orde r s to go bac k.  And, but these good frie nds
 who we r e stationed i n Fra nkfurt wer e visiti ng  
me  and bringing me stuff 
and sort of taking me  out fo r outings 
and I  stayed there until  just  a few  
wee ks , ma ybe t wo we eks, ma ybe t hr
ee weeks, and the n they t ook me 
to Paris in t heir truck.  But  
this ti me it was a nice tr uc k.  It was a c over ed tr uc
k and the be nches wer e sti ll only benches but t he y  
folde d up a blanket a nd I sat on a 
blanket.  And I don't reall y, thetrip was quite lo
ng but I  re me mbe r  
we arrived i n Paris a nd oh, ever
ybody st arted to cheer  because th
e y wer e  goi ng t o go home .  And  
then t hey t o ok me to t he place wher
e I was going to stay, whi ch were 
my cousin's relat i ves.   And I 
stayed with them until I 
got the visa and I left  
in February, I think it wa
s February 4th, into the 
Uni ted States. 
Q: Fr om where did you leave?  
A: It wa s Fe bruary, 1946. 
Q: So you l e ft , ta ke  me  back
.  You le ft Bergen- Bel sen?  

A: I le ft Ber gen- B else n in 1945.  And then I sta y ed
 in Paris, I mean I was 
in Bergen-Belsen, I think 
it was until , either t he end of Jul y or begi nni ng of 
August.  And then I was in Frankfurt for a short 
ti me , j ust  a  few wee ks.  So it  might ha ve bee n Se
pt e mber  tha t  I  ca me t o, or  ma ybe e ve n earlier .  No, 
it mu st have been probably Sept
e mber .  Anyway, I  have a  car d. 
Q: What doe s the c ard sa y?  

A: Okay.  The card is fr om, made
 out to Madame Fayno,
 Anna.  And i t i s 
_______ _________ in 
Paris.  And I enrolled, this car d, [reading in French 
what was on the car d], i t 
wa s t he wi nter sessi on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

And I sta r te d in Oct ober .  And I 
we nt Oct obe r, Nove mber , De ce mber 
and January.  I went for four 
mont hs to _________
_ _________ t o l earn Fr enc h properl y. 
Q: Was  thi s you're  decisi on?  
A: Oh yes.  Yes.  I wanted to do it very badly. 
 Be caus e I did s pea k french.  I had s o me Fre nch, you 
know, I ha d quite a bit of Fre nc h in High Sc hool 
in Pol and.  And I deci de
d t hat I might as well  
utilize my time because it 
wasn't very certain when
 I will get the visa to 
America.  It was very 
difficult to get it.  So th
i s is what I decide d to do
 and I did it .  It wa s ver y  intere sting beca use t he  
teacher did not speak anything but  
Fr ench.  The method t hat  they we
r e usi n g was just l e arning j ust 
like children learn a forei gn language
.  And ther e wer e maybe twenty 
people in the class and I don't 
think there were two of the same 
nat i onali ty.  So it wa s very nice
.  And t his numb
er, 113, wa s my  
school number. 

Q: And the family that 
you wer e st ayi ng wi th, wha t  were  
you're relations 
like with them?  
A: Okay.  The famil y t h
at I was sta ying with were Je wi sh pe
opl e that were my cous in's  wi fe 's 
relatives really.  An
d the y had li ve d, they were
 originally fr om Russia but
 the y move d to Paris and 
they li ved i n  France before the wa
r.  And during the war, they ha
d a cott age out in the country and  
that 's wher e they li ved. 
 And it was not a s ba d a s it wa s in Po
land, t hat you woul
d be , you ha d to 
move to t he ghett o, ther e  wa s no ghe tto in Paris .  Pe ople  whe r e de
port ed but t he y real ly were no t  
deported fr om vill ages.  And they lost their daug
hter and gr anddaughter to 
an accident because t hey  
move d to an apart me nt a nd i n Europe the y ha ve 
wat er he ater s that t urn on whe n you turn on t he  
fa ucet .  So you use  only the a mo
unt of wate r, I me an you heat on
l y the a mount of water t hat you 
actuall y will  use.  And the hu
sband of t heir da ughter was awa
y.  It was the daughter and the 
granddaught er in the apart ment and 
t hey were  found 
dead in the bathroom.  
They evidentl y, they  
took the baths and th
e y shut off t he  wa ter but the  ga s di d not
 turn off and they
 were asphyxiated.

Q: Wh en  wa s thi s?  
A: Th at was , I t hin k th at  hap pe n
ed in 1942 or 19
43.  I ar rive d.  There wa s alrea dy another  young  
woman t her e, Vicki e Zamo
ra.  And she 's in t he registr y.  Be
cause what happened was when my  
cousin was stationed in Leipzig, 
tha t 's whe n he , in ever y ca mp 
he was l ooking for r elative s and 
coul d not find anybody.  
And in Lei p zig there was a whole bunc
h of young wo me n, 
mostly Russian ,  
fr om a labor  ca mp.  I me an, not e xter mi nati on ca mp
, just labor.  And t her
e wa s this young woma n 
who spoke  Russia n a nd she also sp
oke Poli sh.  And she  looked Je wi
s h.  And he  as ked her whether 
she was Je wi sh and, of c o urse , she de
nied, no.  I mean at that ti me, 
because she was in that camp as  
non-Je wi sh, and t hat 's a whole stor
y.  I don't know whet
her she ever made testi monial s in Yad-va-
sham ( ph) because she does li ve in
 Israel.  But what happ
ened was that my cousin t ol d her that he  
would ta ke her to Amer ica.  And s h e was n 't  s ur e
 whether s h e wa nted t o go and all her girl frie nds 
wer e sa ying, are you cra zy?   Yo
u know America.  They are full of
 ki dna pper s a nd ga ngst ers and 
who knows.  He 
probably will sell you into 
white slave labor or someth
ing.  And she decided that 
there wasn't anyt hing worse than sh
e  already we nt  through. 
 And he promi s ed her he wil l  take  her  to 
Ameri ca.  So he did.  He  took he r to Paris a nd he place d her with this Mr . and Mrs . Gar- loos e (ph) , 

this was the name of the people. 
 So she was t here when I arrived. 
 And we share d the bedroom a n d  
we were t ogether goi ng t o the  cons ul ate a nd t o all  the di ffer ent  offices to ge
t the exit visa, to get the  
entry vi sa , a nd final ly we  got t he t icke t
s fo r a liberty ship
, Ra fae l  Rivier a. 
Q: How did you fe el a b
out goi ng to Ameri ca?  
A: Anything but wh
ere I am.  The future is what
 will be different.  I just
 lived in a completely un-
real world.  I , I , at  Itali an Fr
ancoise, I met some  Iranian Prince 
or God only knows
 what, who was a 
hands o me guy.  Ver y, very wea lthy. 
 He intr oduc ed me t o his Irania n
 frie nds a nd t he y staye d at  the  
Ritz Hotel, no less.  But this 
roma nc e didn't la st ve ry long be ca
use I was going to go to the United 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
113 
 
 
State s.  I met hi m j ust be for e we were reall y le
aving.  And he wrot e to me se veral ti me s a nd he  
wanted to come to Ameri ca and 
marr y me .  And my Uncle sa id, y
ou gi ve me the addre ss and n o w  
I'm going to write him a 
letter.  You don't need 
t hat.  I mea n, he s ent 
me  his photogra ph a nd my 
Uncle said, no!  And at
 that time I still, like I say,
 I was a grown woman, I sti
ll felt like a little girl.  I 
never grew up during the fi ve year
s of war.  I was still ei
ghteen, I think, or seve
nteen, or whatever it 
wa s.  And obeyi ng my parent s.  
And, it wa s ve ry good my
 Uncle sai d no becaus
e I didn't need to go 
to Ir an.  But I stayed wit h  my Uncl e 
a nd Aunt  i n New Yor k unt il tha t  s u mmer. 
Q: Tell me  fi rst about arriving
, about you're ride on the sh
i p a nd arrivi ng in Ameri ca .  
A: Okay.  We were on this ship for twenty-one days
.  It was s uppos e to be much s horter voya ge but  
it was a li ber t y shi p and a big tran
spor t of GIs goi ng bac k home  was 
suppose to go on that ship.  But 
they were detained or wh
atever , they wer e late, and the ship co
uldn't wait a ny longer.  So ther e were  
onl y maybe fourt een pas sengers .  There were t he tw
o wome n, Vic kie a nd I ,  a
nd t he rest there was a, 
or maybe e v en les s pa sse nger s.  The r e  was a ne ws
paper man, a repor ter who wa
s comi ng back t o the 
State s.  And there we r e sever al ot her, I don'
t know whether they we r e  busi ne ss m en or s o me  
official s, or whoe ver t he y were , but anywa y t hey 
wer e  all  g oi ng.   An d Vi ck
ie and I had a offic er 's  
cabi n and it wa s ver y nic e.  The r e we re two bunks . 
 And we ha d all the foo
d.  I me an, there was so 
much food on t his ship because 
t he y expect ed, I don't know, 140 
s oldi ers or so, and the y never  
arrive d.  So we  ha d a
ll the fo od in the world. 
Q: Fr om where did the ship leave? 

A: The ship started fr om 
Ru e An e (ph) and we had to go by tr
ain t o Rue Ane ( ph)
.  And I ma de a 
cloa k out of the blanket .   [La ughter ]   And I ha d my
 suitcase.  In Frankfurt,
 my c ous in 
left  some  
mone y a nd t he Ger ma n  woma n took
 me s hoppi ng s o I ha d a  nice 
leat her suitca se and I ha d s o me  
nice cl othe s, but I still wante d my bl anket.  And 
anywa y, we we nt to, oh, 
you see ther e is anot her  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
114 
 
 
thing, I want the past and I don'
t want  it.  Ther e was a not her  youn
g ma n that I me t at  s chool.  He  
wa s Fr enc h, his na me wa s Jerra rd or Jerol d Rosenste
in.  And he ca me  to t he 
trai n sta t i on t o see  us  
off.  And then he came to the 
Unite d State s a nd I  sort of, I sa w 
hi m in  Ne w York 
several times and 
then wh en I left Ne w Yo rk I lost tra c k o f hi m.  
And I a m a ve ry ba d corr e spondenc er.  Ther e is the  
San Fra ncis c o Hol oc aust  Ce nter  and one of t he  pe ople
 on the Board is  Jer ol d Rosenstei n , a  s urvi vor .  
Because they have little dots,
 they are survivors.  
And I never got in touch 
with him.  And I don't 
know, t her e is s o met hing, s o me kind
 of, I me an, my 
head is not quite all right
 in spite of my great 
accomplishments.  I still have a spli t personalit y. 
 I someti mes am ver y nice and someti mes I am 
compl etel y out of my head
.  So, like for example, I don't do th
ings li ke t hat that I woul d, I don't 
know why I don't wa nt 
to get in touch with him. 
 On the other hand, e very ti me I see his na me whe n  
we get the newsletter from
 the  Hol oc aust  Cent er, I sa y, oh, I  ough
t to get in touch 
wit h  hi m.   And  
so, you know?   It see m s to me t h
at  something did happen to me in that  camp and that after fi ft y 
years, I still don't act like 
I use to.  So what happen
ed to this ship, okay, in  Rue Ane (ph) we arrived 
by train from Paris and we  boarded 
the ship at about 6 o'clock in 
t he e veni ng and t hey ga ve us  
dinner.  The ship wa s not 
going t o start on t he  river t o Le Har
bor  until  proba bly 5 o'cl oc k in th e  
morni ng or so.  Well  an
yway, we at e and t hen we
 read and we  sat around 
and finall y we we nt t o  
bed.  I was sleepi ng on t he lowe r 
bunk a nd Vic k ie wa s in, si x yea r
s younger so she can cli mb u p  
and she can have the uppe
r bunk.  An d fi ve o'clock in the mo rn
ing, I felt rocking 
like this.  And it 
turned out the ship was going, bu
t it was going very slowly.  A
nd then the rocking start, it was 
sever al hour s, a nd t hen t he rocki ng s t arted t o be
 quite hea vy.  And e ver y
body wa s sa ying that  we 
left t he port  already and we
 are on t h e water , on t he ocean.  A
nd I ra n up on t he de
ck in my robe, I 
had a robe.  Bec aus e when I wa
s about t wel ve years ol d, I saw 
a movie wit h Gret a Garbo. 
'Christ i na , the Queen of Sw
eden'.  And the scene t hat
 I re me mbere d, s he was standing a t  the bac k o f  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

this ship, there is a name for this
 ship, I don't know exactly, but anyw
ay it  was t he back of the shi p  
with her fl owing gown and she 
had a veil which was also fl ow
ing, and she  looke d at Sweden 
disa ppe aring in t he fog.  And I  was 
going to do this same  thing.  I ra
n up on the deck 
a nd I  ra n to the 
end of the ship and I stoo
d there holding onto 
the railing, seeing 
the French coast di
sappearing in the 
fog.  An d I got so seasick!  It was 
not romantic at all.  I was so sick 
to the point that they had to take 
me down to the cabin a nd lay me down a nd t hey
 gave me some ice cubes and they put cold 
compr ess es and a bucke t  right next 
to my be d.  [Laughter ]  And I wa
s on that bunk 
for mo st  o f t he  
ti me .  I woul d go t o t he 
dining r oom t o eat , it  was not t he  di ni
ng room, it was the me
ss, I think.  And 
I couldn't eat  anyt hi ng, which was a ll right bec aus e I 
gained quite a bit of wei
ght in Pa ris.  Be ca use  
the lady in whose house I lived wa
s a wonder ful cook and 
the y ha d a goos e too!  Ver y  oft en!  So  
anyway, once in a while the weat he
r wa s pret ty good and 
we would be sitt ing on 
t he deck or in t he 
dini ng room and ta lki ng.  And t h
e  young reporte r was  as king all ki
nds  of questi ons .  And Vi ckie  
just loved to talk about her expe
rience.  She was not i n a concen
trati on ca mp.  Sh
e wa s with t h e  
Russian girls in a labor camp.  So she was telling 
hi m all kinds of goodie s and he wa s aski ng me  
que stions but I di dn't want t o ta
l k very much about it .  Anyway
, he  gave us his, he was i n  
Manhatta n, a nd gave us his phone 
number a nd a d dres s.  And t he v
oya ge was ver y, ver y  long, but I  

lived mainl y  on ice cr eam 
because t hat 's what j u st stayed i n 
my stoma ch.  Other wi se I was seasic k 

all the time.  And we fi nally arri
ved  in Ne w Yo rk to  fi
nd out that there is 
a dock st rike and we 
cannot land.  So they 
send us to Balt
imore.  And we  also 
can't land in Baltimore
.  We sat in the New 
York harbor for quite
 so me  ti me and  fi na
lly they said, well get the passen
gers off and t h ey said t hey 
coul dn't, go to Balti more .  So we
 went to Baltimore an
d somehow they notifi
ed my  Uncle and my 
Aunt that  we will be debarking in
 Baltimore.  And so we  sa t on th
e ship in the port in Baltimore and 
fi nall y the y said, get a boat and get our pa sse nge r s 
off, we have enough.  So
 the y di d.  So we c a me 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
116 
 
 
on a s ma ll boat bac k t o t he port  and 
got off.  An d my  Au nt, she cried a
ll the time, so sh
e cried agai n.  
And my Unc l e coul dn't believe it . 
 He  kept on touching me and gr
abbi ng me a nd, evi d ently I di dn't  
look muc h different be ca use I ha d alr eady gai ne d we
i ght and I  looked prett y
 good.  And the y liked  
Vickie very much, she was a ver y
 s w eet and poli t e young l ady.  Anyw
a y, t hey s a id we are goi ng t o, 
by trai n.  And we had littl e package s. 
 "And what is that? "  "Don't t
ouc h it".  " Well come on, what i s  
it?"  "Not hing".  "Okay".  Then 
we sit down on the train and we 
open our  pac kages a n d my Aunt  
says , " Y ou don't need to do t hat .  
Th at's food and we wi ll 
go t o the di ner ."  " Wha t 's  a di ner? "  "It 's a 
dining cart that will have fo
od."  "Oh." So we packed it up and 
we put it away and she said, "Throw 
it out."  "No!"  So we he
ld ont o our f ood.  And t h
en my Aunt  looked at us
 and she said, "Well, you 
know what? "   She ha d a beauti ful ha
t on and we had hats that  we boug
ht in Pari s.  And I think we  
bought it in a place wher e 
the la die s of the ni ght buy hat s be c a
use my Aunt sai d, " We ll, you know, 
in America, when you go 
to a di ning place , you r eally don't  wear 
hats i nsi de."   So s he took he r ha t  
off, and my Aunt woul dn't 
be  ca ught  dea d wit hout a hat .  But 
she  wa nted us to t ake  t hos e horri bl e 
hats off.  Mi ne wa s with a feat he
r sticking out like that
.  I  re me mb er it  was  a 
pheasant  feather , j ust  
like this.  Well anyway, we didn't wa
nt to do that but we took the ha
t s  off and we we nt  to the di ner  
and then we starte d to eat .  And 
she c oul dn't belie ve that t wo y
oung wome n can consume that muc h  
food and be still hungr y.  The n we ha d to lear n 
how to ea t the Ameri can 
way.  Because  you see in  
Eur ope you hol d the fork and t he kn
i fe and you cut with you'r e  left 
hand.  And s he s howe d us ri ght  
there in t he diner t hat you eat wi th
 the fork with you're left hand a
nd you don't pile up stuff on the 
fork and eat  it like t hat .  So anyw
ay, she treated us really like tw
o very young girls , whi ch r eally 
wh at we  wer e .  I me an , with s oci
al graces and t hings like . . .

A: . . . c a me to Ne w York. 
 So  anyway, we arrived 
i n Ne w York  and  my  Uncl
e ha d his  car  par ke d at  
the trai n stat ion a nd he drove us .  And the n I sai d , 
"Oh, could we se e that street? "  " What stre et? " 
"You know, the stre et that you ju
st s t and on a nd it goe s by it sel f." 
 Evidently at th
e Wo rld's Fair, 
they had this sidewalk lik
e that .  And he s aid, " We
ll, not today".  And we ca
me to their apart ment .  
And they moved to a new, 
knowing that we are going to be ther
e, they will have 
more people living ,  
they moved to a l arger apart ment.  
It was really a very la
r ge apart ment  on 86th Str eet i n Manhattan.  
And we had a dinner at the di nner
 ta ble a nd t her e we re gr ee n pea s, fr es h gree n pe as in Febr uary. 
An d my  Un cle sai d ,  " O h, we
 ha ve a  hot hous e up on top of t he 
roof".  Well, he 
wa s l ying.  They  
wer e fr oze n peas .  I di dn't know 
t hat you can fr eeze 
peas and t hey would t a ste 
a s i f you just pic ked 
them out of a hot house.  Anyway, 
there were an awful lot of surpri
ses.  And it took us quite a while  
to get adj ust ed.  But we  got  a phone 
call fr om the report
er .  And he  . . . 
Q: T he sa me  rep orter  wh o wa s on  the  ship?  
A: The re por ter who was on the shi p. And he wa nt ed us t o come for 
some  kind of a part y that t he y  
had.  And my Aunt was very lee r
y and says, " Well all  these are peop
le that we met 
on the ship and  
it will be all right", and it was 
l i ke  maybe a  c ouple of we eks a f
ter we arri ved.  And it  was  
some where on 14t h St re et 
and the neighbor hood, we
 we nt by subwa y, a nd t he neighbor hood wa s  
not e xactl y l i ke my Aunt 's.  But 
t here was no elevator and we wal k
ed up I think to the third fl oor 
and it was a very small apar
t ment and there were an 
awful lot of pe ople.  But Vickie liked to talk 
about her experiences and all that, 
but I really didn't.  Anyway, th
er e were sever al people and the y  
wer e as king us que stions  and Vi cki e wa s telli ng s t
ories and I wa s ans weri ng 
i n sort of very short  
sente nce s, a nd the n the young ma n, he
 wasn't in uni for m an

be for e, but anywa y, s o he was ver y  nice.  He wa
s ma rried and his wi fe was t here ,  just a youn g 
woma n.  And he  as ke d us to come

I think two days later.  And ther
e wer e ca mera s and pe opl
e and all kinds of thin
gs.  And there wer e  
some other people .  And they t ook 
pi cture s of us and I we nt i nto 
hyst erics .  Be cause I didn't know  
what was going on and I want ed 
my Uncle and t hey got hi m.   And he ca me a nd I know he was 
shouting at everybody.  A
nd he t ook us out of t here .  And the n
 t he ne xt mor ning, there was a pict ure  
of Vic kie a n d me a nd t he se three othe r people.  Th
e people wer e showi ng th
eir numbers.  And there  
was an arti cl e about  the t wo refuge
e girls that wer e  taken care by 
Mr . Aar on Chi l -o- vitc h (ph) and it  
went on and on and on. 
 And my Uncle started 
getting telephone calls of
 people who wanted t o  
adopt us.  And who wa nted to give
 mone y.  And who want ed
 to do a ll kinds of nic e things t o us. 
And I was very ba d be ca use my Uncl
e got very, very angry.  He re ally s h oul d ha ve gotten angry a t  
Vickie because it was all her idea
 really, to participat
e in that.  And my Un
cle was goi ng t o s ue t he  
newspaper for $3 million. 
Q: What ne ws pa per?  

A: I think it was either 
The Ne w Yor k Ti me s or, I  don't know whether ther e was a not he r large pa per  
in Ne w Yor k , I don't r e me mber .  For years I ha d t hat 
article and then I finally 
threw it out.  Because, 
you see , be fore we arrived, my Aunt  cons ulte d with 
a ps ychi a t rist and she wa s told t hat  they s hould  
keep us in seclusion.  That th
ey shouldn't ask us an
y questions and just s
ee how we  respond.  And 
not to e ven me ntion the ca mp.  I me
an, we shoul d just for get the w
hol e thing.  And 
we should live 
as if it neve r  happene d.  And I th
ink I mi ght ha ve  had se veral sessi on
s with this psychiatrist but I 
don't reme mber very mu ch 
about it.  I didn't 
wa nt  to talk about anyt hin
g.  But anyway, the offshoot 
wa s that we  shou ld 
live in seclusion.  And just try to live as
 nor mal li fe as possible.  My Aunt 's  
daught er, my cousin, wa s 
my age , s h e wa s marrie d.  And she wa
s in Sweden.  Her husband and she 
bot h were worki ng for, I  think it 
wa s  calle d Unite d St ates , s o me kind
 of book, Int ernational Book 
Association, or somethin
g like that, and they were working in
 Sweden.  And she had a little year-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
119 
 
 
and- a-ha l f girl, Cla udia ,  wit h a 
nanny.  That one al so li ve d in
 my Aunt 's  apar
t me nt.  And I  
re me mb er o ne da y, I me an th
ese ar e all sort of anecdot
es of re me mberi ng t hings that ha ppe ne d later .   
One da y, oh, the nanny use to t ake
 the ba by out for an outi ng a nd 
then come back late in the  
afternoon.  An d then my Aunt calls
 me in and Cl audia is sleeping in
 the crib, and she had nice, long 
hair.  And my Aunt sa ys
, "Look how she 's, every 
evening when we put her 
to be d, she 's  scratc hing 
her head so sweetly".  Vickie a
nd I l ook at he r.  "She 's got l i
ce!"  " What  do you me a n she 's got  
lice? "  Well , the wa y she 's scratc hing her he ad, th
at means she's got lice.  Now wh ere ca n the chil d 
get lice but from t he t wo refugees. 
 So my Aunt was out of her  h
ead.  Anywa y, Vic kie wa s hol ding 
the baby on her la p and I  wa s doing t he usual .  And 
t here wer e lice.  And my 
Aunt almost fell to the 
fl oor i n a  de ad fai nt.  " What do 
we do now?"  Ed ith, the mo ther of 
t he chil d, i s going t o be  her e i n  
two or  three weeks.  Well , where 
did s he get t he  lic e?   Of c ours e, 
fr om Vi ckie and me .  I  sai d, " W e  
don't ha ve a ny li ce.  We  
we re de-l oused be fore we ca me  he re."
  Well  anywa y, tur ned out t hat  the  
child got lice in the park
.  I don't know wher
e  t he nanny took her but  s he di
dn't get the  l i ce fr om us . 
And my Aunt sa ys , " We ll, 
what  do we do? "  I s aid, " Well , first 
of all, you cut her 
hair as short as 
possibl e."   Preferably shaving, th
en you don't ha ve a ny pr obl e m at 
all.  We ll, we didn't shave the 
child's head but we cut it ab
out half an inch or so a
nd the n I thi nk the y got s o me kind of a de-lousi ng 
liqui d or flui d or  some thi ng fr om 
a  dr ug store  and got ri d of t he  lice.
  But  there was  Claudia, looki ng  
like a little boy with very, very shor
t hair.  And my cousin wanted a 
picture of her daughter that sh e 
hasn't seen for al most a year .  
So my Aunt was very indust r i ous 
and s he got a  pre tty kerc hie f a nd  
she ma de a  ba mbooshka  a
nd t here was one pi ctur e of Claudia in
 a ba mbooshka and a n other pict ure  
of Cla udia  a s a gypsy gi rl.  [La u
ghter]  Anyway, they were really
 cute  pi cture s a nd Edith couldn't  
underst and why the chil d had to be all dressed b ecause she came ho
me maybe three or four weeks 
later.  And t hen s he found out .  And she al so s us p
ected Vicki e and me, but 
then the truth came out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
120 
 
 
that it was the nanny that took 
her somewhere where t he 
child got the lice.  
But anyways, that 's  
anot her  st ory. 
Q: Di d yo u 'r e  Unc l e an d Au nt inte
nd t o a dopt you l egall y i n some
 wa y, or  wa s t hat an i ssue?  
A: No, I was  grown up.  You see the people tha t  of
fe red the adopti ons a nd all 
that, they had no idea  
wh o we wer e  an d wh at it  wa s.  B u
t no, my Aunt a nd Uncl
e, there was no need 
to adopt me.  I was a 
grown up wi dow and the y thought of
 adopting Vickie but Vickie didn'
t wa nt  to be adopte d.  I mea n, 
she was eighteen.  No, she was about  
seve ntee n or  sevent een a nd a hal f 
or s o.  There  wa s no nee d to 
be adopte d. 

Q: Did you have
 a citizenship?  
A: Yes.  I applied for the, I mean
 I had that alien registration card 
and it would ha ve ta ken five years 
to get a citizenship.  But in the 
mea nti me , I deci de d to lear n English r eally proper l y a nd I  enrolle d in 
Judy Ric h mond High Sc hool a nd I 
t ook Ameri c an hist ory a nd I  to
ok Englis h 10, Englis h 11 and 
Englis h 12.  In Engl ish 10, I r ea d 
what varies, what plays.  They we
re all pl ays.  What every woma n 
knows.  And in Englis h 11
, Ha mlet .  And i n English 12, Ma cBet
h.  And then I ca me  home  a fter  
classes and I  sat down wi th a dicti onar y and I tran
sl ated every si ngle word 
in the reading assignment 
for that day.  I stayed unti l  about mi dnight or 
1 o'cl ock i n the morni ng.  And I was me mo rizing a nd  

me morizi ng and me mori zing. 
 And my Aunt a n d Uncle i nsi sted 
on speaking English, what they 
thought was English.  But it wasn
't a very good Englis h, s o t he E
ngli sh I  ende d up s pea king was 

also not ver y  good.  But I  tried.  And I  re me mber writi ng a pa per in the Ameri ca n His t ory about the 

Pilgr i ms.  And t here was a sentence
 that , 'profli gacy took
 pl ace of sobri ety'. 
 That was about t he 
Pilgrims.  I don't know 
exactl y what  they wer e doi ng but that
 was the upshot. 
 And because i n  
Poli sh, the l onger the word and th
e more compli cated, the 
more educat ed that person is that would 
be using it .  So I was  l
ooking fo r the longest 
words for  mos t  s y llable s a nd s obriet y and profli gac y, it  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
121 
 
 
sounded ve r y good.  And my hi story teac her, I  
reme mber her first name
 was Ber nice , I don't  
re me mb er h e r last na me , b ut sh e 
was a si ngle woman and she real ly
 took a liking to me and she  
helped me a tremendous 
a mount a nd she t hought t hat was t he f
unniest thing she's ever heard about 
the Pilgri ms.  And I remember I 
gave her a bottle of perfume, I 
think it was Prin
ce Matchabellie, 
and she wrote me a t hanks you no
te that she's going to use that 
for s o me profli gac y between he r  
mo ment s of sobri e ty.  So anywa y, 
tha t 's another thing.  So a fte r 
I finis he d, I took the Rege nts, t he  
Ne w Yor k Re gent s, a n d I pass ed, I think I got  
only s e ve n, but it wa s a passi ng gr ade , and my  
En glish wasn't too bad by then an
d I also was accepted to
 Hunter Coll ege.  An
d I  was  going to sta r t  
Hunter Colle ge in Sept e mber, but my Aunt had a 
big fa mil y  reuni on.  M y 
cousin ca me bac k from 
Sweden wi t h her husband and her 
hus ba nd's br other s c a me  to visit .
  They ha d a  la rge house  in 
Sta mford, Connectic ut, s o we ha d a  
big party and a bi g fa mi ly reuni on
.  And the older  brothe r of my  
cousin's husband was a Professor of
 Bact eriol ogy in Dall as, Texas medi
c al  school.  And he sai d tha t  
instea d of going t o Hunt e r  Colle ge , I coul d c o me  
to Dallas, live in their 
house and ma ybe do some  
babysitting.  And they ha
d two children, 4 and 7, 
and I could work in the 
laboratory and 
I could go  
to the Southwe stern Uni versit y, er , Methodi st Univer
sity.  Sout hwest at Meth
odi st Univer sity.  So, I  
thought this was a wonde
rful opport u nity t o get a wa y fr om Ne
w York, fr om my  Aunt and from my  
Uncle.  Not that I was ungrateful
, but they treated me 
like a little girl and I 
was a grown up woman.  
So I le ft .  And with t h eir bles sing.  And I liv
ed in t he Pr ofessor 's hom
e and I worked in t he 
labor ator y a nd that 's  whe r e I met my f uture  hus ba n d. 
Q: What did you wa nt t o study?  

A: Well I  thought I  wanted t o st
udy medici ne because t he l abor at
or y was, and I was ver y much  
interested in bacteriology and I was working with
 mice and there were all kinds of experi ments 
studying pol i o.  And the Profess or ha d an i dea t ha t  
if you put mic e to s l ee p, 
not dead but just with

the ether and just prevent them 
fr om moving a r ound a nd s ort of 
living in a twilight zone, even  
though they are infe cted with 
polio, they do not develop the 
symptoms and they will not get 
paral yze d.  So thi s is what we were  doing.  Wa
tching the mice, whether 
they get paralysis and 
whether the y die d, and if t he y di
e d we ha d to t ake t heir br ains 
out and pres erve t h e m and then 
exa mi ne t he m, so it was  very, very 
i ntere sting.  So I reall y t hough
t I would s t udy t h at and at t he  
University I took biochemistry a
nd a  couple of other c our ses and 
more Englis h a nd t hen, J une 1,  
1947, I  got mar ried.  An
d we  move d to Mi chi ga n. 
Q: Wh at wa s you're husband's name?  

A: My husband's name 
was Manual Levin.  Ther
e was no middle initial.  
And he was originally 
fr om Ann Arbor , Mic higan. 
 And that 's where t he Uni versit y 
of Mic higan was .  And he was a  
graduate of t he Uni ver sit y and t he Medical  Scho
ol.  An d there was a whol
e gr oup of, he was  an  
intern in the Medical School in 
Mi chi gan when the war st arted and 
then he enlisted, 
we ll he wa sn ' t  
an e nlist e d ma n, he  was  in t he Na vy
.  I ha ve a pi cture of hi m here . 
 He was a doctor  i n the Navy . 
And he wa s in the ser vice  for fi ve ye ar s.  And then
 when he wa s  discharge d, he dec i de d t o bec o me a  
surgeon.  And he ha d s urg
ical internship an
d s o he wa nted to c ontinue  his  studie s and act uall y,  
be for e he l e ft, he wa s alr eady assi sta nt resi dent a
nd then he got the three-year residency.  So I had 
three  ye ars i n whi ch I  c o uld study whate ver I  wa nt
ed.  And t ried t o get a  
de gree .  So I gr aduate d 
fr om University of Michig
an in 1949 and I got a de
gree  in Zoology, whic h wa
s a  pre- med.  But  then 
I deci ded t h at it woul d have bee n proba bly ver y  di ff
icult at that time to ge
t into medical school.  
Wo me n wer e  not r eally, there wer e
 a lot of men that ca
me bac k from t he war and appl ied.  During 
the war, two of my  husband's sist
ers  wer e  a cce pt ed t o me dic a l sc ho
ol.  On e of them
 fini shed, the 
other one got a Master 's in Bi oche mis t ry and ma rri ed 
a doctor .  So I di dn't th
ink that, I only had one  
year , or a ye ar and a hal f.  So duri ng t hat ti me I de
cide d to go to gra duat e s chool and I got a Degre e  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
123 
 
 
in Medical Technology.  So I, we
 move d t o Detr oit a nd for a  year
 I worked at Mt. Carmel  Mercy 
Hospit al as a Medical  Technol ogist 
whi l e my husba nd was tr ying to 
est a blish a sur gi cal practice.  
But t hings were not movi ng very 
well , and not onl y that , but t h e wi
nter was  very hard a nd we ha d 
one bad car  accident, not our fault,
 we just ski dded in the snow. 
 And then I commuted to t h e 
hos pital by bus .  And i f  I mi sse d th
e bus some ti me s I had t o  wait for 
a n other t hre e-quarter s of a n  
hour, in othe r wor ds , we just di dn't like the weat
he r.  And my husband wa s 
always telling me about  
the fa ntastic, beautiful, warm Ca
lifo rnia.  And so we
 decide d to l ook ar ound a nd we ended up  
moving to Fresno, Califo rnia
.  And that's where I still liv
e, in Fresno, Califo rnia. 
Q: Wh en did you de
cide to seek restitution fr
om the German
 government? 
A: Actually I don't reme mber exactly
 the  da te but  I didn't  know anyt
hi ng a bout it .  And a fri end o f 
mi ne from Czechosl ovaki a wh
o was not i n t he camp, 
I t hink she came to t h
e United St ates before 
the war, no, ma ybe a ft er  the wa r, but I didn't ha
ve the detail s really, but she was not i mpris one d 
duri ng t he c a mps , a nd s he sa id t hat there has be en
 a l aw passed that  all  the for mer inmates an d 
survi vors a n d so on ca n get rest ituti on.  And it 
was suppose t o be a l u mp sum de pe nding on t he  
condition, the health condition of the person, there 
would be a pension.  So
 I really didn't know 
much about it and I st art ed 
to investi gate and, as a matter of fact
, we came to Pari
s on a visit, with 
my sec ond husband, a nd we visi
ted the Ga-loose-es (ph).  Now 
the ol d people, no act ua lly, it was 
the lady that died, but 
Mr. Ga-loose (
ph) was still alive and his son 
was a doctor and the daughter 
was married to a German 
lawyer who was sp
ecializing in the restitution
s and he was German, he 
wa s not Je wish.  And he  ga ve me  a  
name of a lawyer t hat
 I should contact that
 would be helpful .  
And I cont a c ted hi m, his  na me wa s Mr. Colli nge r (
ph) and we were c orre spondi ng ba ck and forth. 
And t here is a st ack of li teratur e on t he subj ect 
because, as Mr. Co
llinger (ph) expl ai ned, it  wasn't 
his de ma nds for all kinds of proofs and dates a nd s o
 on, but it wa s the Ger ma n gover n me nt that wa s  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
124 
 
 
very thorough be cause a n ybody co
uld clai m a nd t hey onl y ha d so mu
c h mone y to di stribute.  So I  
spent quite a bit of time writing 
letters and then getting an answer
 fr om him and 
asking for even 
more answers and it was 
many, many years of co
rresponding back and fo
rth until finally I got a 
request that I  be exa mined by a Ger man doctor.  A
nd that was already after 
my second husband died 
so it was a ft er 1977, bec ause I r e
me mb er my so n dr ove wit h me 
to Sa n Fra ncisc o.  We ha d an  
appointment.  And evidently that doctor, that 's 
a ll he was doing is e xa mi ning pe opl e, or I don't  
know, it was  very, ve ry s t range.  
The office wa s very ol d fas hi one d 
in s o me big office buil ding i n  
San Fr anci sc o.   And I fe lt very, 
very unea sy bec a use he was quite r ude a nd he als o was not ver y  
gentl e.  He a gain ga ve me a g
yne col o gical e xa mi n ation and he pok
ed me all  over an
d it was a very 
bad experience.  And I kn
ow that I fe lt very bad.
  My son was there, I 
mean, waiting in the waiting 
room and he didn't know wh y I cam
e out cr yi ng, but I just, I  mean, 
the whole business of camp and 
ever ythi ng e l se jus t  ca me bac k to me so vi vi dly 
that I thought, I'm just going to forget the whol e 
thing and I'm not going to go through with it.  But I 
did.  Then, the ne xt thin
g they de ma nded that I 
be e xa mined by a ps yc hi atrist, als o
 a Ger ma n  ma n .   An d so tha t  wa
s anot he r trip t o San Fra ncis co. 
And that lasted most of the day,
 because first I was gi
ven a whole stack of que
stionnaires to fill out 
and I thi nk t hese  were t h e sta nda rd s ort of questi ons
.  Do I feel that  I'm be
ing followed?  Do I have 
night mare s?   Do I ha ve  del usions?   Anywa y, t hes
e were things that, some of them were quite 
obvious what I'm suppose to answer if I want to 
get my restitution.  But an
yway, I answered to the  
best of my ability.  I didn't have to
 do much lying because 
I didn't fe el that I 
am being followed, but 
I certai nly was al ways awar e of wh
at  was goi ng on around me .  And 
al so I did have night mare s and 
I, somet i mes  I didn't fe el  very 
good.  There wa s one incident  year
s and years later , as a matter of  
fa ct, it was  a bout si x yea r s ago.  
Wh en we came back fr om Eu rope , 
we landed, usually we land i n  
San Fr anci sco, but t hat particul ar 
time we took the Pan Am, I thin
k the l a st yea r  Pa n Am was in

125 
 
 
busi ness, and we l anded in
 Ne w York .  An d we  ha d to  g o th ro u
gh cust oms .  And the  air port i n Ne w  
York was Kennedy's.  But it wa
s so crowded a n d we  got of f th
e  pl ane  and the n we  ha d t o go 
through all these different corridor
s and at one point I got se parate
d fr om Robert an
d I starte d to 
scream.  Because people 
were pushing from all  side
s and I  just  coul dn't 
bre ath.  And I  lea ne d  
agai nst t he wall  and I st arted to sc
ream.  And the guard or  the stewar
des s or whoe ver i t  was ca me  t o 
me a nd s he wa nte d to know what
 was wr ong and I coul
dn't breat h, I c o uldn't tal k.  I was j ust  
absolutely petrified.  I 
mean, that just felt like I was in a ga
s c ha mber wit h  all the people pus hing 
and pull i ng and, it wa s a bsol utel y
 horrible.  And I thin
k Robe rt fi nall y s o me
how found me a nd we 
we nt, he pus hed me  ar ound a nd we 
went into t he l arger space out of
 the corridor into
 the main area 
where we c oul d sta nd i n line s waiti ng for the c u
stoms  to go thr ough with us , and t he pa ss port  
contr ol, a nd so on.  But  I have i ncident
s like that all thro
ugh my  life, really.

Q: And, you wer e s ayi ng?  
A: So I reall y cannot st a nd cert ain si tuations .  A
nd I don't like crowds .  I don't like l oud noi ses .  I  

can't sta nd a nybody sc re a mi
ng at me.  I cannot, I j ust lose my 
mi nd.  I just can't
 commu nicate and I  
have to re all y try t o compos e and get a hol d of my sel f
.  And I t r y to a voi d si tu
ations li ke that.  And I  
cannot stand smell of burnin
g gas oline.  When we driv
e in the car, Robert like
s fresh air intake and  I  
wa nt it shut up bec aus e he ca nnot s m
e ll the ga s and I j ust , I j us t  don't  
want  any fres h air  in the car  of  
that sort.  So some of the things 
ki nd of sta y with me , but I try to 
s mile , I try to show my happy fac e  
most of the t i me.  But t here are ti
mes when I get t hese attacks of f
ear , of pa nic, and someti mes it i s  
very di fficult  for  me .  But  mo
st of the time, I can cope. 
Q: Have  you found t hat you 
think over the year
s a lot about you'
re experiences? 
A: I can't say that I think a lot, 
but there may be things 
like certain inci
dences that w
ill remi nd me of 
things and I, we ar
e making those pilgrimages now
 to Poland and each time 
I go I hope that I will 
fi nd s o met hi ng.  And I know I wa nt, I we nt thr ou
gh the rec or ds here, I mean
, that wa s one of t h e  
pur pos es of t he tri p, wa s not j ust t o have t he i nte
rview but to go through the records.  But I real ize 
that the records I am l ooking for, 
the y woul dn't be here .  I me an, t h
ere i s no reason for them to be  
here be ca use  they are not  complet e and, as I sai d, t he ans w ers I  a m see king, first it is pr oba bly too 

late.  You know, i n t he sp
an of ti me .  I  mean, peop
l e are in t heir  70's and 
someti mes they don't live  
that l ong.  Nor mall y.  So I may 
be l ooking for  pe ople who j ust pa ss ed a way, the  nor mal wa y.  Li ke  
for example, when we were in Po
land this last summer, Yesh-ir 
Mos-tof - ski (ph) wa s in per f ect  

healt h we t h ought .  And he
 was .  And we had a nice vi sit.  M y 
da ughter s, two of my daughter s, me t 
bot h br other s and we had tea a nd it was just very l
ovel y.  And t hree days lat er I found out that Ye sh-
ir (ph) j ust  died fro m a  hea r
t att ac k, and s at down t o pai n t 
one of his  pai nting and a ske d his

house kee per  to br ing hi m a  cup of 
t ea and when she r etur ned with 
t he c up of tea  he  wa s stre tche d 
out on t he fl oor , gone .  So I know
 I  a m sear chi ng a nd probably t he 
thing that I think most often 
about is my little sister. 
 And I watched Schindler's List, the m
ovie in the house, 
we seldom go to  
movie s.  We  usuall y re nt  laser 
dis cs and wat ch t he m at home, bu
t we went to the movie a nd we  
watched it.  And I think the 
scene with that little girl, I just couldn
't take it.  I really thought I would  
start s crea mi ng ri ght  in t h e middle of t he movie .  
And I was hol ding Robert 's 
ha nd and tr ying to just  
say, it is a movie.  It seemed so real to me th
at she was about the age of
 my sist er.  And I just  
thought t hat what I  was seeing on th
at  movie, what I was 
seeing in the fil m, re
ally was happening. 
And tha t  ma ybe my siste r  
is somewhere ther e.  And thi ngs like 
that happen to me all the time.  I 
don't know whether I mentione d to 
you t hat on one of t he vi sits in Pola nd, Che s- we f (ph) tol d me  
that he had a pres ent for  me a nd he
 hande d me an envel ope and t hey
 were pict ures of my sister . 
And he sai d that my father as
ked to take s o me pict ures  and 
Ches-wef (ph) was an amateur 
photographe r, he had a Lika
.  And he took the pict ures a nd he ga
ve me the copi es.  He c oul dn't find 
the fil m but you don't ha ve t o have
 fi l m now to make copies , s o.  
These are probably my, I  consi der  
them my very precious possessi
ons, and I am still hopin
g that maybe some th
ing happened and she 
did survi ve.  But I don't know.  
I know it just wouldn't be pos sible .
  But not knowing whether they  
wer e kil l ed i n the ghett o or whet
her  t hey were put  on the  truck or 
whether t hey die d on the wa y, or  
whether t hey were put i n the gas 
chamber, or wh at happ
ened.  Just not knowin
g is probably mu ch 
worse than if I really was told.  Th
at t h is and thi s a n d thi s ha ppe ned. 
 And then you j ust
 s ort of put it 
away.  This is the same thing like 
fu nerals and wa kes or me mo rial serv
ic es, t hat you j ust sort of say  
good- bye  to the per son, say 
good-bye to the event, an
d that's it.  But in th
is way, you just don't  
know.  You don't  want
 to consi der t he  per son dea d  bec ause y
ou don't know that th
e y ar e dea d.  And 
that 's pr obably what  keep
s me a wa ke very ofte n a nd ma ke s me sort
 of lead a double
 life.  And it's

probabl y t he  har des t t hing.  Bec aus e 
most of the time, I look
 pretty.  As I 
told you that 
the fi rst time 
when we talked on the phone, I am
 not a little old lady, 74 years old.
  I take care of myself, I go to 
the hairdresser, I put make-up o
n.  And I get up at 6 o'cl ock in
 the morni ng a nd 
I go through my  
exerci ses and I get dressed and I read the newspaper,
 eat br eakfast, a nd we get in the c ar  and I go to  
work.  And all day l ong I wor k w
ith young pe opl e.  I ha ve a very r e
sponsible job in t h e area that I 
am wor king because I 'm the one 
who has to see to it that all the costumes are r eady for the  
per for mance at the speci fic ti me.  And t hey are.  A
nd this is one of the things  that  I pride myself, 
that we haven't, were never late.  That all the costum
es are in lockers, all in 
order , a we e k be for e  the  
dress rehear sal.  And then we ar
e alr ea dy worki ng on t he  ne xt produc
tion.  So I feel t hat  I  a m doi ng 
my j ob a nd I  a m al wa ys s mi ling, a nd very fe w pe opl
e know what reall y is ha
ppening to me.  But I  
feel that even though I lead sort of a double li fe
, mos t  of it is only ma ybe15% of my exist enc e. 
And that's why I don't like to be alon
e and mo st of the time Robert has 
t o go on a tri p, I go wit h hi m.   
And ve ry oft en whe n he has to go ba ck to the offi
ce in the evening, I go with
 hi m, and I can al ways 
wo rk  in  my  o f fice  
or  in my ar ea, i n 
t he shop, a nd wait for hi m.  But 
I don't  like  t o be  ho me alone  
beca use  then, I me an, I  don't partic ul
arly like to watch tele
visi on, I li ke t o r ead.  But it i s whe n I  a m  
alone is when I  reall y sor t of
 go back.  And I do
n't think that one ca
n ever , ever forget . 
Q: Do you still ha
ve nightmares? 
A: We ll ye s  I do.  And Robert 
can tell you.  And I c an't  descr i
be exactly what happens but  
someti me s I wa ke up a nd I don't k
now wh ere I am and so me times I 
don't wa ke up and then I wake 
up, Robert i s  sha king me , and I s ay, " What 's t he 
matt er wit h you? "  And he
 s ays , " O h not hing, jus t  
go t o slee p".  But some ti me s he wa
ke s me  up a nd I 'm i n a not he r room
 and not in the 
bedroom.  And  
I really can't exactl y describe what  happens. 
 Probably t h e most recu
rring thing is that I'm 
somewhere i n Pol and and I am looki
ng for my pa rents or I ' m l ooking 
for my sister, or I am runnin g

away fr om something.  But 
I can't really describe it. 
 And I don't want to talk
 about it.  I don't even 
wa nt to tal k about it to Robert .  And I did tal k 
about it to M a nny, that 's my sec ond husba nd.  But  
because I was in a much worse st
at e when we got marri ed, and I to
l d hi m, I di dn't  want to get  
mar ried beca use I didn't think that I was wel l  enou
gh.  But I knew that he wante d to ha ve childr en  
and I didn't know that I should have
 any chil dren.  And as I t o ld yo
u be for e, t hat I  reall y di d not , I  
wa sn't a ver y good mot h er, and lik
e my kids say, " Well , Mar garet 
br ought us up" , and I don't thi nk 
that t hey r eal ly feel depri ved an
d they fe el that I deprived them 
of something, lettin
g Margaret bri ng  
them up, but it was better 
that Mar garet was mot hering t hem th
an, you know, in a 
good way, than 
me not doing it.  It was better for me to not do it at 
all than do i t  in a bad wa y.  But I did, I think that  
the worst part was when the childr
en were little.  Then later on, when
 they were teen
-agers, I did a 
lot of things with th
e m an d we  went  o n tri ps an
d we went  on a l ot of c a mp
ing trips.  Ma nny liked to 
go on ca mpi ng t rips  a nd we had a 
house trailer and fo od 
and then also I part icipate in t he ki d's 
education and I drove them 
to musi c lessons, to whatever lessons they had to go to and they all did 
very well i n school .   I m
ean, when it  came t o t heir  
studies and things, I was ab
le to participate.  But 
I think that the emotional part, I 
just c oul dn't.  I some
how feel that I c oul d 
have done much more , 
you know, watchi ng my friends wit h t heir chil dre n
, t hat I  haven't done as much as t he y di d. 
Q: You me nt ione d t hat  you go 
back to Poland quite often. 

A: We go once a year. 

Q: Is t hat  di ffic ult  for  you? 

A: No.  This is why, it is not 
di ffic ult now beca use  th
e first t i me when we went it was a sightseeing 
trip for Robert.  We went from 
one town to anot her and the n  the Kra kow trip, part of the Kra ko w  
trip was t o go to t he di ffe rent pl ace s a nd t o see Ch
es- wa f ( ph) a nd t hat was t he first ti me I sa w Che s-
waf (ph) aft e r the war.  And it  real
ly was cat harsis, I think.  It was ra
t her good for  me.  It was a  ver y 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427

short tri p, but the foll owi ng year, 
we we nt for a whole mo
nt h, or eve n five wee ks .  And we di d a lot  
of things, going bac k t o t he place s.
  We went to the camp Poroskov
 (ph) where my br other  was  and 
we walked t hrough the fi
elds and l ooked at t he 
monu ment s.  And I  thi nk 
it reall y was good for me  
to do it.  And now we ar e goi ng t o go again, the 
4th of June , we a l rea dy ha
ve t he tic ke ts.  And we  
will be there this time only three 
weeks because we want to be on
e week in Londo
n, Robert wants 
to go to the theatres, and we pl
a n t o see our fri ends, a nd we pla
nne d a gain, we ma y even go t o  
Ausc hwitz a gain a nd wal k the roa d fr om Ausc hwi t z 
to Bir kena u.  I did wal k it with my daught ers a 
year a go.  And of cours e , it is n'
t t he sa me, you walk on a si de wa
l k, on a pave d roa d, a nd it i s not 
very di fficul t .  But I would have  pr e ferred to go 
before  the y made t he  pa ve d road, but a nywa y, w e  
ma y wal k again.  And 
I think it is, I don't think it 
is painful as much as it is
 just getting 
it out of my  
syste m and realizing that life goes
 on.  That  I am alive.
  That I walk the ro
ad.  There is another  
thing.  When I learned to drive, 
and before we came to
 California, we bought
 a little Nash Rambler 
for me .  And we towe d it behi nd th
e bi g car so we had t w o c ars .  
And I drove the Nash Rambler for 
several years until fi nally I was in 
a car accident and it kind of curled
 up when I was th
rough with it. 
And s o we we nt shoppi ng 
for a car.  And it was several year s 
ago beca use I re me mber Bobby was 4  
years  ol d the n.  So we we nt to a 
Chr ysler agency I believe because 
we  were goi ng t o l ook at a not he r  
Chr ysl er, a n d ther e I bac ked i nto a lit tle car.  A
nd I turne d ar ound, bec aus e I  wa nted a s mall car, and 
I said, " Oh, that 's my s i z e!  And it is  robi n egg bl
ue!"  I love d that c ol or.
  And my husband sai d,  
"Sta y a way from it".  And 
I said, " Why? "  " We c an't a ffor d that, 
you c an't drive anythi ng like thi s."  
" Why not? "   "Thi s is a Porsche " .  " Wh at 's a Por sc h e?
"  "A Porsche is a Ger m
a n car a nd I don't thi nk  
you want it .  And it is ve ry expe ns
i ve ."  You ca n get a Volks wa gen at
 tha t  ti me for 
a b out $1,000.00 
and tha t  Por s che was $3,000.
00.  And I sai d, "I wa nt 
it" .  I  wanted t hat car .  
It was a t w o- seater  with 
a jump seat  i n the back. 
 And he sa ys , " Well wher e 
will you put the kids?"  
And I sai d, "In the ba ck. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
131 
 
 
Bes i de s, I ' m goi ng to drive it." 
 We bought the Por sche a nd I br
ought it home a nd 
Bobby, my son,  
ca me out and, " Did you get a car fo
r mother? "   And he sa ys, " Oh yes ,
 and it is your siz e".  And so  
he ope ne d t h e door  and j u mpe d i n t h e car  a nd sa
ys, "How do I ma ke it go?"
  He says , " Whe n you 
grow up.  This is mother's car
."  We ll anywa y, I wa s goi ng t o  wr
ite a book and I dr ove a Porsche 
and . . ., and I drove a Porsche .  
Elea nor, my middl e da ughter, s aid
 that s he 's  goi ng t o wri t e a book, 
there  was a  book writt en by, I 
for got who it wa s, but , you k
now, Mama 's bank account.  I 
Reme mber Mama, they made
 a play out of it.  She was going to
 write, Mama's Little
 Porsche.  And  
the Porsche became a symbol .  This
 was a wonderful cathars
is because real ly, every ti me I drove the 
Por sche, I r e member Kr amer , t he 
Comma ndant of Bel sen-Ber gen l yin
g on top of the tr uck wit h the 
dea d pe ople.  And I  dr ove a Por sche.
  And Rober t  is cr yi
ng.  [ Laught er ]  No reall y, thi s  wa s a ver y, 
very, a lot of peopl e ask me , " How on earth ca n y
ou dri ve a Ger man made car
? "   And I said, "That 's  
the whol e point".  That 's the whol e poi nt.  That I liv
ed to drive a Ger ma n ca r.  And not j ust, well , I  
didn't  like Mercedes Benz 
be cause it was  too e xpe nsi ve and i n 
t hos e days  it wa s t oo bi g, but t h e  
Por sche wa s just my size . 

Q: What happened to it? 

A: It became very, very
 expensive.  And everyb
ody wa nted my Po
r sche.  People 
would, when I 
ca me to a st op li ght , pe ople woul
d be honki ng a nd, roll down the wi
ndow, "Hey, wa nt to s ell it? " 
Or , "Do you want t o sell  the hub caps? "  It had the big e na m eled e mble m  of the Pors che on the  

hubca ps.  It 's hub c ap wa s about 
$200.00.  And I had it sitting on th
e drive way and 
ca me home one 
night a nd I found all four  hubca ps  
gone.  And t he side vie w  mi rror 
hal f uns cre wed and t he bac klight  
compl etel y uns cre we d a nd gone.  So
 it was about, I forget
, al most $800.00 wort
h of r eplac e ment. 
And it didn't  have air conditi oni ng.  Robert sa id 
no.  And s a i d, " Well , I can get ne w hub c aps ". 
"Ye s, you get ne w hub caps a nd sel l  the Por sche " .  I 
said, " N o, I can't sell  the Por sche .  I want to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
132 
 
 
drive  the  Por sche " .  He s a ys, " Yes , a n d we 'll go t o 
a Chinese restaur ant and pa
rk the car just in fr ont 
in the parking lot and they will st
art serving, you pick up you're chop
 sticks and you 
put them down 
and then sa y, 'Robert , I  think s o me body's taki ng 
off the hub caps , will  you go and look at the 
Por sche? '.  And he sa ys , "I want to e at dinner a
nd not to wat ch you're Porsc he '.  So we a re not going 
to drive the Por sche anymore.  
Well , we clea ne d up the gara ge and we dr ove t he Pors che int o the  
gara ge.  And onc e in a while I woul
d go a nd l ook at it.  We replaced
 t he hubca ps, and the bac k light ,  
but I didn't drive it a nymore.  And one bea uti ful day, 
I made a decisi on.  That
 the Porsc h e ser ved it s 
time  and it's purpose an
d life goes on, and we kn
ew a builder who 
said, "I will build
 you a dining 
room for t he Porsche".  
And I did ha ve a ver y, we ha ve a  ve r y
 nice house, but th
e dini ng r oom was  
very s mall.  And we had a spec ial di nner for a gro
up of fr iends , about fourt
een people.  An d we had 
to put up bri dge ta bles a nd all ki nds of things to
 ma ke enough room fo r ev
erybody.  An d I always 
said, "I wis h  I coul d have a long ta bl e in the di ni ng 
r oom" .  And Robert said, 
"Well, this is you're 
opport unit y" .  And we ge t rid of t h
e Porsche.  Al was the 
na me of the buil der a nd he s aid, "I 'll ta ke  
good care of it and you will have a 
beautiful dining room".
  And I ma de the de
cision.  All right. 
And he brought his fl at be
d because he didn't want to drive it after sitting in the garage for ten years 
or s o, and they put t he Porsc he on 
t h e flat be d a n d he  dr ove a wa y.  
And the ne xt morn
i ng he starte d  
rippi ng up t he old di ning r oom an
d now I  have  a be auti ful , big di ni
ng room wi th a 
table that will 
seat fo urteen people.  Dr exel.  
A beautiful dining room set.  An d 
the Porsche, the 
Porch is in good 
hands  and I  don't  even
 want t o know what ha ppe ned t o it . 
Q: Could you talk a little 
bit about the work that you've done? 
 I know you mentioned that you'v e  
gotten t hree Master 's Degrees? 
A: Well yes.  Ther e is t h e Medi cal
 Technol ogy, a nd t hen I did wor k 
for about a year a nd a hal f i n  
Detr oit but then when we mo ve d to Fresno, I dis c ove
r ed I was  pregnant .  So I, and the n my husba nd  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
133 
 
 
worked in the hospital and 
I t hought of getti ng a job t here but t h
en I r e ally di dn't want to work  
beca use  I r e ally wa s a f r a id t hat ma ybe  tha t  mi ght
 hurt t he  ba by and bein
g in the hospital with 
diseases and things, so I decided to
 stay home.  But I still 
kept my Registry, you 
had to be registered 
in California fo r several years, un
til I eventually gave that up.  I de
cided I don't want to be Medical  
Tec hnologist  afte r all.  And I, when t he chil dre n
 wer e little, especi ally when, e ve n thr o ugh my first 
pregna ncy, I  took pai nting le ssons . 
 And I  was  doi ng a l ot of painting 
and I  enj oye d t hat  ver y much . 
The n I joine d Co mmunit y Theatre . 
 And the y found out th
at I can pai nt a nd act , so I wa s acting in 
some pl ays.  And also t h ey wante d
 me to hel p wit h the sc ener y.  And si nc e, I reall y, I kne w how to 
paint pict ure s but I di dn't  know t hat
 much about scenery, I went to co
llege.  At that time it still was 
college, now it is a University.  And I enrolled in 
t he Dr a ma Depart me nt .  And the n the y said, we ll,  
wh y don't you just work on you're 
degree i nst ea d of just ta king c our
ses .  So I s aid, fine.  And I 
acted.  And I  was an assistant t o
 the sc ene desi gner .  I desi gne d 
scenery for t he Communi t y Theat r e  
and then I de sign ed scenery fo r ou
r Univer sity Theatre and I got a Ma
st ers De gree  in Theatre .  And,  
at the same time, I wanted
 to polish up my skills in
 painting, so I went to 
the Art Depart
me nt and I 
starte d getti ng, you know, j ust t o 
get  s o me clas ses  in dra wing a nd pa
i nting a nd sc ulpt ure .   And t he n 
they said, you've got enough
 credits now, you can
 really get you're Master's
 Degree.  So  I started to 
take more  gr aduate cl ass es a nd I  di d get a  Ma ster 's
 Degr ee in Art.  And that I got with distinction 
beca use  I di d s o me  innovative proc
e ss on my sc ulpt ures  a nd the t h
esis was cer a mic 
bowls .  And it  
wa s rea lly st one  ware .  And t he n 
I _____________ silver, 
copper  and silver.  Ov
er  the stone ware.  
And the whole thi ng wa s, aga i n, 
a wonder ful c athar sis though, beca
use the symbol of the bowl.  
When we came to t he camp we 
got a  bowl.  One  of those bi g, en
amel bowl s that we re ma de in, 
probabl y i n Schindler 's factor y.  A
nd they are on display. 
 And here there is just
 a s mal l case , but  in 
Auschwitz t here i s a case the size 
of a small room filled
 wit h bowls.  And t his wa s probabl y, once  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0427  
134 
 
 
more, most preci ous pos sessi on.  
Be caus e i f you didn't ha ve a  bowl
, you c oul d not get food.  That  
wa s the only way you could get you'
re cup of coffee or you're bo
wl  of soup.  So the bowl wa s 
something that you put
 under you're pillow made out
 of blanket or a rag.  
And you really
 guarded it 
with your life, because this was your life.  So I de
c i ded to ma ke  bowls that a r e compl etel y usele ss .  I  
like prett y things s o I ma de ever yt hing very prett y
.  But you ca n't put anythi ng in that bowl, t hey ar e  
either t oo s mall or too big or too cr ocked or t oo 
pretty.  You wouldn't put so
up in a bowl that has  
bea uti ful  de s i gn i nsi de .  But  then i t  i s all gooc ke d 
up wit h s o me  ki nd of a c
id to make it shiny and 
polis he d a nd what not .  I don't  thi nk 
t he soup would ta ste  ver y well  mi
xed with the chem
icals.  So I  
made a lot of bowls.  And they are 
not just bowls, t hey are c ont ainer s.  Di ffe rent types of cont aine rs.  
And I was making them just in th
e Ar t De part me n t .  So me o f t he m are t hro wn on a wh e e l, so me o f  
them are just built up.  And then
 when I got through with the st
one ware and the 
enamel, I would 
move  on to the c he mi str y de part me nt, whi ch t he y 
ga ve me a  lab t here .  
And t hat 's where I  would  
per for m the ________ for mi ng.
  It is quite a complicat
ed pr oce ss.  I f you us
e copper sul fate and t he  
silver cyani d e, and sul fat e acid and el ectricit y.  
And I had a lot of fun connecti ng wire s and doing 
things... 
[End  of Si de A of Tape 8] 
Q: Go on. 
A: Anyway, he gave me a cyani de r e
susci tation kit.  Just i n case I 
have an accident wit h the sil ver  
cyanide or the gold cyanid
e that I was working wit
h.  And the cyanide has a 
bitter almond 
smell that  
you c an re all y smell it i f i t  gets spilled and what not . 
 Anywa y, t he resuscit ati on kit is a, I don't know 
exactly what it was, I still have it.  This big syringe 
of something or other.  I 
don't think I, I told him 
I don't want  to even thi nk of using it, but a nyw
ay, a nd I wa s laughing a nd I said, "I  know what  
cyanide is".  And I know it smells
 like bitter almo
nds.  That was pr
obably one of the 
best cures for

me i n a cert ain way because I was worki ng wit h ma
terials that were the deaths in some, and the 
hopelessness.  And here 
I  wa s doing a nd ma ki ng beauti ful t hings 
for the future.  So it is sometime s 
very di ffic ult , but on the other hand, i t  is easy i f 
you reall y wa nt it.  So t his  is what I wa s doi ng and
