We are now going to find the c ountr y of Lithuania on the m ap.  Ther e it is .  In the Baltic s tates .  
 
 
Nes s e Godin was  bor n Nes s e Galper in in 1928 in Siauliai, Lithuania.  There it is.

When her  par ents owned a stor e
 
--
 
they would s ell dair y pr oduc ts.  Siauliai was hom e to a 
vibrant J ewis h c omm unity of about 10,000 people.  This  is  a photograph of Nes s e as a young girl.  
She's  jus t as c ute as s he is  now.
 
 
Her e's  another pic ture of Nes s e with her fam ily.  Family has  a c irc le dr awn about her.  She's 
to your
 
left, all the way to your left, this  little gir l right here.
 
 
After the Germ an Ar my invaded Poland in 1939, Nes s e's  fam ily hear d s tories , bec aus e they 
were in the Rus s ian s ec tor , in the Baltic  states , and they hear d stor ies  from  relatives  in Lodz, which 

was  a large
 
--
 
whic h is  a lar ge, industrial c ity in Poland, that J ews  were being horr ibly mis tr eated.  
Nes s e's  family found thes e r um or s hard to believe.  But by 1941, Ger man troops  invaded the Soviet 

Union to which the Baltic s tates  had been annexed in 1939 and they occupied the Baltic c ountries , 
inc luding Lithuania. 
 
 
In Siauliai, Lithuania, Nes s e and her family were forc ed to m ove into a ghetto.  And in 1944, 
as  the Red Arm y appr oac hed that area, Nes s e was  deported to Stutthof conc entr ation c am p, which y
ou 
s ee r ight ther e.
 
 
Nes s e was  trans por ted to s everal c am ps  and finally was  s ent on a Death Mar c h in 
J anuary
 
1945.  On March 10, 1945, s he was liberated by Soviet troops .
  
 
 
And in 1950, after s pending five years  in a dis placed per s ons c am p in Germ any, Ness e Godin 
em igr ated to the United States.
  
Her s tor y is  one of thos e experienc es encounter ed by Holoc aus t 
s ur vivor s  and today s he is  going to s hare that story with us .  Pleas e help me in welc om ing Nes s e 
Godin.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
 
Thank  you for joining us  today, Ne
s
se, Ms.
 
Godin.  Befor e we begin
 
kind of talking about your 
Holoc aus t exper ienc es , c an you tell us  what it was  like to live in Siauliai, Lithuania, befor e the war with 
your  fam ily, your  brothers  and your par ents ? 
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, I grew up in Siauliai, Lithuania.  Actually, J ewis h people wer e inv ited by the king 

to c om e to Lithuania after  ter r ible things  that happened in Spain, to c ome and to teac h the Lithuanians  
bec aus e they wer e mos tly farm ers.  We were very c omfortable.  In m y town we had 15 s yna
gogues.  
We lived a norm al life.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Do 
you 
r em em ber  the outbr eak  of war in your town?  How old were you then 
and what do 
you 
r em ember about that? 
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, I tell you, we ac tually did not have televis ion. We did not have a r adio.  Her e, 
the c hildren, m y gr andc hildr en, watc h televis ion and they hear the news .  We didn't know anything 
about the news .  And espec ially our  parents didn't want us to be sc ared about it.  I r eally as  a c hild 

didn't.
  
My mother's  c ousins  s uc c eeded to c om e to Lithuania from  Poland.  And ever y tim e they us ed to 
tell s omething, m y father us ed to s end m e to get him  a glas s of water
 s
o I wouldn't hear  what he was  
s aying.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And how old were you when the war s tarted?
 
> > Ness e G
odin:  I was  13 year s  old. 
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And in 1941, when war  ac tually c ame to Lithuania, when the Germans 
invaded the Soviet Union, do you r em em ber  that?  Do you r em em ber the oc c upation of your  town? 
 

> > Ness e Godin:  Yes, I do.  Bec aus e all of a s udden m y m other s aid, you know, the Army is  c om ing; 
we hear  mes s ages from  other towns  that the Germ an Arm y is  c oming and they want to get in Rus sia, 
Soviet Union.
 
 
You s ee, the m ain road from Ger many to the Soviet Union was  thr ough Lithuania.  It r
an 
through our town
, 
S iauliai
, t
he m ain r oad.  So m y m other  would r em ember fr om Fir st Wor ld War how it 
was .  She s aid
 l
et's all r un to the bas ement
; w
e have to tak e s om e water, s om e food, maybe a blanket.  
You know, war  m ay be shooting.  We s at in that bas em ent.  Nothing happened.  Bec aus e they wer e not 

intere
s ted in Siauliai or in anything.  So we thought we were going to do a norm al life.  
 
 
Next thing we knew, another gr oup c ame.  Eins atzgruppen they were c alled.  And thos e wer e 
the Nazis  that joined the
 
wr ong c rowd.  We s ur viv or s  always  tell young people don't join a group that 

3 
 
you don't k now what they are s tanding for .  Bec aus e now m any of the Nazis  s aid
 
we
 
didn't know,
 w
e 
didn't under s tand.
 
> > Patric ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And s o thes e Eins atzgruppen, thes e 
are the s o
-
c alled mobile killing units, 
par ts of the SS and polic e units , and they cam e to your town
 o
bviously following in the trail and 
m ur dering J ewis h c itizens  along the way.  What happened in your town?
 
> > Ness e Godin:  The firs t thing that happened in our town, they s tarted to grab people off the streets , 
m en and boys .  Allegedly they needed them for war  damage, to c lean up war  damage.  But ther e was  
no war dam age in Siauliai.  So they put them in the c ity jail.  And from ther e they were taken out and
 
we 
did not know wher e to.
 
 
My m other had the store that s he s old m ilk, c heese.  My father  work ed in a s hoe factor y.  And 
the farmers c am e with the merc handis e every day.  We didn't have fr eezer s  or r efriger ator s.  When 
they found the s tore c losed, they c a
me to the hous e.  And we were lined up, m y two brothers
 
--
 
one 
was  five year s  older , one s even, and my par ents, and I s aw the farm ers  standing and talking to m y 

par ents and doing like this .  So I wonder ed why they're moving ar ound.  When I c ame c los er, I h
eard 
them s ay that the earth over the s o
-
c alled graves  moved for many days .  
 
 
What thes e evil people did?  They took c los e to our c ity, forc ed them to dig long holes , and 
jus t s hot them.  And m any of them  wer e still alive but they bur ied them aliv e bec aus e they didn't s hoot 
them pr operly.  This  is when I lear ned that the Holoc aus t was  happening to m e in Siauliai, Lithuania.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  So thos e wer e the 1,000 boys  and m en that went and were s hot. 
 
So did the 
Nazis  ac tually oc c upy Siauliai?  And did they introduc e new anti
-
Semitic legis lation after  the s hooting 
happened?
 
> > Ness e Godin:  After  the s hooting happened, the Nazis  r ight away m ade new r ules  and r egulations .  
J ewis h c hildren wer e not allowed to go to s c hool anym or e.  Our par ents  wer e
 
not allowed to have 
bus ines s es .  Everything was  c hanged.
 
 
Sinc e we had s uc h good relations with the Chr istian c omm unity, a J ewis h c ounc il dec ided to 
m eet with the pr ies ts and begged them to help us s o we wouldn't be killed like the other people did.  
But 
when our counc il c am e to the pr ies t, the pr ies t s aid to them  we ar e ver y s orr y, we c annot do 
anything unles s  we get or der s fr om above.  "Above" m eant the Vatic an.  You know?  
 
 
I don't know if you're aware, there was  a statem ent by Pas tor Niemoller.  That 
pastor
 
--
 
when 
they c ame for  the J ews , he didn't s peak  up bec aus e he was n't a J ew.  When they c ame
 
--
 
ther e wer e 
m any vic tims .  I'm  a J ewis h per s on.  I tell you what happened to me.  But then they c ame for him.  And 

ther e was  no one left to s peak  up. 
 
 
So 
what does  it teac h us? When s om ebody asks us  for help or we s ee trouble, don't s ay it 
does n't bother  me.  We are all God's c hildr en by whatever nam e we c all him .
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Did you have to wear a J ewis h s tar? 
 
> > Ness e Godin:  Yes.  We had
 
to wear  a J ewis h s tar in fr ont, in the back  of the garment.  Many times  
people s ay to me
:  Y
ou wer e a blond little gir l; you looked like a Catholic  little kid
, w
hy c ouldn't you jus t 
take off the star?  I c ould have done it but unfor tunately the neighbor s
aid
, " S
he's  J ewis h."  
 
 
Why did they do that?  That's why we have in the mus eum the exhibit about the neighbors .
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Exac tly.  The c ollabor ators and s ome
 
wer e
 
neighbors .  Exac tly. 
 
 
At s om e point your  family was  forc ed into a ghetto.
  
Can you tell us about that? 
 
>>
 
Ness e Godin:  Yes.  At s ome point we were told that the ghetto was  going to be built.  Many times  
you s ee people moving to the ghettos , furnitur e, ever ything.  It didn't work that way.  A s pec ial 

c om m ittee c ame to every hous e.  They were as s igned a plac e in the ghetto, who will go, who won't, 
and what you c an tak e.  
 
 
So when they c am e to our hom e, my two br others , as I said, they were older  than m e, my 
par ents.  A young gir l, s he was  about 16 years  old, s he knew how to wr ite German.  They told her wr ite 

a 
doc um ent for the two par ents, write for the two boys , none for the kid.  Pointing at m e.  Can you 
imagine how I felt?  What's going to happen with m e?  I don't get the doc ument? 
 

4 
 
 
Why
? T
hes e evil people wer e tr ying to steal whatever we had
, s
om e pic tur es ,
 
whatever .  My 
m other  approac hed this  young gir l and s he gave her  s ome money and s he asked her to leave a 
c er tific ate for m e.  The gir l took  the m oney and put it in her pocket and s he didn't s ay anything. 
 
When thos e evil people left our hous e, my parents  quickly looked at the cer tific ates .  Ther e were two for 

m y br others, two for m y par ents, and one blank  certific ate.  The girl was  very s mart.  She left the 
c er tific ate but s he c over ed her s elf.  She c ould s ay it just got stuck .  So that's  how my parents  c ou
ld fill 

in m y nam e and I c ould go in to the ghetto.  
 
 
Yes , this  gir l made a differ enc e.  Maybe I am aliv e bec aus e of her dec is ion.  Every day we 
m ake a dec is ion. We have to think  about it.  Did we do the r ight thing? 
 
> > Patric ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  What happ
ened to thos e c hildr en that didn't have a c ertific ate, Nes s e? 
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, the c hildren that did not get in, and s ome people that wer e handic apped and 

sick 
eld
er ly, they wer e taken to a plac e near the bor der of Latvia and they wer e killed in mas
s  graves . 
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Do 
you 
remember
 
--
 
onc e you were in the ghetto, do 
you 
r em ember your  life 
ther e in the ghetto?  Can you tell us  a bit about that?
 
> > Ness e Godin:  I want to tell you, I want to s hare with you one day in the ghetto of Siauliai, Lithuania.  

At that point I was  15 year s  old, 15
 
1/2, m aybe.  We were told that we are leaving the ghetto. We 
believed it.  I c ame to the gate to go to work.  They s end me back to the room.  Ins ide the room, my 

m other , again, s he s aid you have to
 
put on layers  of c lothing bec aus e they were deporting us  or 
s om ething to m ake s ure that we are ok .  But a little bit later  the J ewis h plan
 
--
 
they s aid, a m istake was  
m ade, go to work.  So we went to work.  
A
ll day long we wonder ed what will thes e people 
do there
. 
W
hat were the trucks outs ide doing
?
  
Wer e they delivering food or  taking som ething out?  
 
 
As  we were c om ing back  that day fr om  work, we heard cr ies  c oming from  the ghetto, s uc h cr y 
that no one s hould hear.  The few people were told exac tly what 
happened that day.  Ges tapo, those 

evil people, ran thr ough the ghetto together with Ukr ainians .  Uk rainians  joined the evil c aus e. Why did 
they do that?  They ran thr ough the ghetto.  They found ever yone there.  They had to line up and at the 
gate one Nazi with a point of the 
gun
, to the right, to the left to the r ight to the left.  1,000 innoc ent 
c hildren thr ough the age of 14, 500 elder ly and s ick , and a few hundred healthy and s tr ong.  
 
 
You s ee, the Nazis  figured out the healthy and the s trong m ay fig
ht them bac k .  So they took  
them out of the way befor e they even took the c hildren and the elderly. We did not know then where 
they wer e taken to.  After the war  we found out that this  tr ans port that was  c alled the c hildr en s election 
was  taken to Aus c hwitz.  Now it's  c alled Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau.  They were taken s tr aight into the gas  
c hamber s wher e they were killed and their bodies wer e burned in cr em ator ies .  
 
 
My dear fr iends, on that selec tion I los t m y father .  Str ong, healthy, beautiful man. Why was  
he
 
killed?  Bec aus e the Nazis  thought he may fight them back .  
 
 
The life in the ghetto after  the c hildr en s elec tion was  ter rible.  No c hildr en, no futur e. 
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And s o at s ome point, though, the Soviet Army c ame in 1944.  Do you want 
t
o fill in any tim e befor e the Red Arm y c am e or do you want to tell us  about that time when you were 
evac uated fr om the ghetto? 
 

> > Ness e Godin: Well, I tell you, did not s ee the Soviet Ar my. We were lined up and we were taken to 
we didn't know wher e.  We
 
were put on tr ains .  We traveled four, five days .  We c am e to a 
c onc entration c am p s hown on the map, Stutthof.  As  we arr ived in Stutthof, again, we wer e lined up.  

There were guar ds .  They s end you one way and another way.  My br other was  s ent one way.  
M y 
unc le another way.  My father was  killed already.  I s tood ther e not knowing what's  happening to me.  I 
was  16 year s  old.  And a J ewish woman s aid to m e, "
W
ho ar e you?"  Becaus e I was  blond with the 
blue eyes .  They were wondering who am I.  And I s aid the wor d [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language].  It 
m eans  one of your people.  My mother always  s aid in c as e there is s om ething, let the people know who 

you are, like a s pec ial word.  And the wom an pulled m e over  and s aid, "
L
ittle girl, s tay with us ."  Y ou 
s ee, 
bec aus e of the terrible things  that they
 
did
, the wom en tr ied to pr otect us
 
an
d tell us  how to act, 
how to be.
  
I stood over ther e not even knowing why or what, not knowing wher e m y m other  was  taken 
or  m y brother s.

> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And you talk  ver y often about being a number  rather than a per s on.  Can 
you s ay s omething about that? 
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, I tell you, when we c ame ther e, we wer e lined up and we wer e taken into a very 
big room.  We didn't know what the r oom was .  We wer e or der ed to
 
get undr es s ed nak ed.  The room 
was  a s hower r oom.  So we thought we wer e getting a s hower. We walked in and we got the s hower .  

And we were taken out, out of s ight. We stood ther e a long tim e naked.  Then we were lined up and we 

were registered.  You kn
ow?  Where you c ome from and s o forth.  And then they s aid, "
No mor e 
nam es .  You're a number."  In the other c am ps, you have your num ber  on your  c lothing 54,015.  That's 

when I had to ans wer
, 
not name.  Terr ible when you don't have a nam e.  You bec am e a no
thing.  And 
then you were as s igned to c ertain blocks for  work.  
 
 
Should I c ontinue? 
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Yes .
 
> > Ness e Godin:  She's  in c harge of the time. 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Ness e Godin:  In the mor ning, we lined up and they, again, s ent people out
 
to labor , people here, 
people ther e.
  
One day a woman s aid to m e, "L
ittle gir l, they're going to kill you."  Said to me like this .  I 
s aid
, "W
hy are you s c aring m e?," s he s aid, "If you c ould get out to a labor c am p, maybe you will 
s ur vive." 
  
How do I do that?  Well, they line up people.  You have to s tuff yours elf with straw s o you 
look s tr onger, stand on your tiptoes  s o you look taller, pinc h your c heeks  so you look  healthier and 
m aybe you'll s uc c eed. 
 
I s aw women being lined up.  I s nuck  in the r ow.  An
d that's how I left the 
c onc entration c am p with 5,000 women.  We were div ided into labor c am ps. 
 
 
What was  the labor c amp?
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  What was  the labor c amp?
 
> > Ness e Godin: We lived in a tent.  You k now?  Som etim es people think  you go c am ping in a tent 

whic h is  a little differ ent.  We s lept on str aw.  Ever y m or ning they woke us up and they gave us a tiny 
little piec e of br ead.  They c alled it c offee.  It was  brown water.  Then we worked. What was  the work?  
We had to dig c one
-
s haped holes  in the gr ound, [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language] they c alled it, for 
enem y tanks to fall in. 
 
 
It was  terr ible work.  Gr ound was  har d. We had with the pick do it.  If we s at down for  a 
m inute, they hit you.  It was  ter rible.  In the evening when we c am e b
ack
,  
we wer e s o tired.  And then 
they gave us soup.  But ther e was  nothing in it.  Jus t water. 
 
Many of us s tar ted to die fr om hunger, 
fr om  c old, from  dis eas es.  Mos t horr ible year of my life.

Ric e:  In J anuar y
 
1945, s o dur ing this quite c old winter in Europe, you were s ent on 
what we c all a Death Marc h.
 
> > Ness e Godin:  Yes.  They lined us  up one m or ning.  They s aid tak e your
 
blanket and your  dis h for 
food;
 
we'r e leaving the cam p.  So we thought we were going to
 
--
 
we wer e alr eady in la
bor c am ps, s o 
we thought we were going to one m or e.  But that's when we s tarted the Death Marc hes .
 
 
Why is it c alled the Death Mar c hes ? We gave it that nam e. We walked and we s aw s o m any 
dead people.  Fr om our own gr oup people just fell and died.  Some wer e shot. We walked that way  
until the m iddle of Febr uar y
 
1945. 
 
 
We s et up c amp outs ide of a little town.  It's  in Poland.  But in thos e days  it was  Germany.  
When we got in there, they or dered s om e people outs ide.  They had to dig two holes .  One hole, a long 
hole, they put s om e s ticks  on, s er ved as a bathr oom .  So we thought maybe we have s om e s lave labor 
work ther e.  The other hole was  to be a grave.  The guards knew.  Every morning the healthier  women 
had to take out the dead, undr es s them naked.
 
 
If 
you go thr ough our exhibit ups tairs, you wonder
 
--
 
m any tim es  s tudents  com e over to whe
r e 
the s urvivor s  work and say why did they make you be naked
. 
 
They thought the baggage c an die naked 
but the c lothing, r ec yc le, us e them .  They valued more the c lothing
 
than the hum an beings .
 
 
You know, when I us ed to go to the bathr oom, s o
-
c alled, and I looked at that m ountain of 
bodies , I us ed to go into the barn and
 
s it and cr y and c r y and s ay, "D
ear  God, let me die.  Let my body 
be on top of this  m ountain."  And thos
e J ewis h wom en s aid to me, "
S
tupid little gir l. Why do 
you 
pr ay to 

6 
 
die?  The enem y wants  you dead.  You have to live.  But if you s ur vive, you have to promis e us that 
you will teac h the wor ld what happened her e s o they wouldn't allow it to happen again." 
  
 
Unfortunately we s ee it again and again and again.

Ric e:  At s om e point you wer e liber ated, wer e you not? 
 
> > Ness e Godin:  One day the wom en that had to take out the dead bodies , they ran into the bar n and 
they s aid they didn't s ee
 
the guards .  So s om ebody s aid m aybe they'r e hiding.  Somebody s aid maybe 
they r un away.  We didn't know the news . We didn't know the Rus s ian Army was  c has ing them .  We 
had no idea what was  going on in the wor ld.
 
> > Patric ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  I s hould s ay the Death Marc hes  m oved all of the pr is oner population from  
Poland, Eas ter n Eur ope, into the Ger man inter ior.  That's what they wer e doing.
 
> > Ness e Godin:  Exac tly.  There's  no doc ument, really, to tell wher e they were planning to tak e us.
 
> > Patric ia Heber

-
Ric e:  Right.
 
> > Ness e Godin:  There is  all kinds
, 
m aybe they want to dr own us, m aybe they want this.  They didn't. 
 
 
So we s at there in the bar n all day long not even k nowing that the guar ds ran away.  In the 
evening we hear d boots  m arc hing.  The women
 
saying "
T
he henc hm en are back."  Then we hear  
Rus s ian language.  And its  Soviet Arm y telling us:  The Ger m ans  are los ing the war ; 
we ar e chasing 
them; we ar e going to r un after them
;a
 
few days  later s om e medic s  will c om e and help you.  The 
women were kis s
ing their  hands and their feet.  I c r ied.  The women s aid, "W
hy are you c r ying?  We 
ar e going to be free."  W
hat'
s going to happen with me now? 
 
Wher e am  I going to go?  Don't I have a 
family?
  
That's  when I started to look  what's going to be m y future.

Ric e:  And s o, you wer e s eparated from your m other at that point when you went to 
Stutthof.

> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  So now that you wer e free, the medic s c am e and liberated you.  You were 
s or t of on a new journey then.  This is  not perhaps  as  diffic ult but c ertainly  s till diffic ult.
 
> > Ness e Godin:  Yes.  You s ee, when the m edic s  c am e, they s et up in a sc hool gym nas ium, a 
hos pital.  At that point we wer e just like 200 women from the thous and.  They r egist ered everyone.  I 
was  unc ons cious .  All of a s udden I woke up and I s aw s omebody tending, "W
hat's  your name?  
ﬁWho 
i

Nes s e Galperin.  And s omebody in the r oom  s aid, 
ﬁ
oh, everybody all 
week ar e tr ying to get you to s ay your na

ﬂ
  
 
 
Well, they gave us help.  And then we wer e r egis ter ed.  And when I c ame over  to be 
r egis tered, bec aus e I was 17, I was  a minor .  I needed a fos ter  m other.  Right next to me was  s tanding 

a wom an.  I didn't know her.  They s aid to her , "
T
his  kid is  y

ﬂ
  
The woman didn't want m e.  But s he s aid to me
, w
ell, now you have to follow m e; we ar e going to the 
r ailroad s tation.  How to go to Lodz, Poland?  Why to go to Lodz
 
Poland, I wondered.  She s aid 
s he left 
a child for s afe k eeping
 a

So we c am e to Lodz, Poland.

Ness e Godin:  There was a plac e to r egis ter .  And in the r oom there were big posters .  You s igned 
in.  And there was  Siauliai.  And I r em ember s tanding there and I was  s igning 
m y name.  And the 
woman s aid, "L
ittle girl, you'r e making a mis take.  We didn't
 
have anybody looking like you in Siauliai, 
Lithuania."  I weighed 69
 
pounds .  My face was  swollen.  I was  beaten up.  Five teeth wer e knocked out 
fr om  the Death Marc h.  I s aid, "I k
now you.  My name is Nes s e."  "Oh, it's  you."  "I didn't r ec ognize you."  
" Y
our  mother is  alive!
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
Your  m other is  alive!
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
Go to this  border and you will find her."  
 
 
To m ake the stor y s hor t, I went to the fos ter  m other.  She s aid

don't need me.

Again, "Who ar e you?"  They didn't rec ognize m e.

up in the dic tionary what c los ure m eant.  
 
 
So I went to the Mus eum , was  getting opened.  And Mr .
 
Meyer hoff, that we dedic ated a

He s aid,

I have frequent flyer points .  Get yours elf s omebody from  the Mus eum that wants

And we went.  We went to Auschwitz.  I was trying to find the cr emator i

We went looking plac es .  Then somebody gave me s om ething.  They said this  is the ar ea 
wher e the brother

Then I c am e to Lithuania.  I s aw the plac e where I lived, where my s ynagogue was .  It's  a bar e

were s uc h a c ommunity.  There was  nothing there.  
250 Jewis h people.  They s tayed ther e bec aus e their  c hildren were m arr ied.
 
 
The las t plac e we went was  Stutthof.  In Stutthof they have like a little m us eum  ther e.  When

loud, "I was  her e. 
 
I witnessed it.  It happened.
 
Thous ands , m illions  of people wer e killed.

They

ut when you go thr ough our m us eum  
and you'r e on top of the s teps, we have a new ex hibit.  It's a few years  old now, "Fr om Mem ory to 

A

hin

any c ountry.  And I hope that humanity will never  allow r eally thes e things  to happen.  But unfor tunately

in the m or ning, the first thing I do, I look  at the paper .  People ar e killing eac h other  all over  the wor ld.  
The
y didn't learn the les son yet.  So c ar efully s ur vivors  dedic ate them s elves  to teach. What happened 
s houldn't happen again.  But people don't r ealize as  long as they ar e c omfortable at home, they don't 
s peak  up.

Ric e:  They don't s peak
 
up.
 
 
We have tim e for one mor e question.  Is  there one m or e question out there s omewhere?  This  
young lady down here, pleas e. 
 
>> 
Do you get together with other  s urvivor s  or  is  it too painful to br ing up thos e m emor y and talk  about 
them ?  Do you have any r elations hips  with other sur vivors ?
 

> > Patr ic ia Heberer

Ric e:  I know the ans wer to this  ques tion.  Do you get together with other 
s ur vivor s ? 
 
> > Ness e Godin:  Of c our s e we get together.  In this  c ountr y, who wanted to lis ten to us ?  We got 
together and we
 
us ed to s hare, talk .

I always  wanted m y c hildren not to hear all of thes e things.  My mother  us ed to s ay 
they need to know.  
B
ut we us ed to s it and eat and have a good tim e.  And what did we talk  about?  
Our exper iences .  And that's how our  c hildr en r eally learned.  And we ar e so pr oud of them bec aus e 
when I s ee a c hild of s urvivor s  s itting there, standing ther e, and giving you the m icr ophone, they all, you 
know, grew up together.  We m ade s ur e that our c hildr en would get that educ ation.  We made s ur e and 
they took  over.  They are ther e for us and are c ontinuing to teac h the world what happened.  But m os t 
of all, it s houldn't happen again.
