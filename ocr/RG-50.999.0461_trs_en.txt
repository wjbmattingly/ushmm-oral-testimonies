>> Bill Benson:  Start, if  youdon'tm ind, Morris, by telling us just a little bitabout yourf am ily 
and your comm unity bef ore the war began. 
 
>> Morris Rosen:  I lived with m y fam ily.  I have a large fam ily
;  
eight children,m y parents. W e 
lived ver y nice with the gentile people.  Our store was m ostly 99% gentilepeople. But things 
changed in 1939. T hewar started out 
Septem ber
 
1, 1939.  
 
 
I woke up in the morning
, s
ucha noisef rom  the airplanes.  I lookedout the window 
andthere were about60 of them.  I counted them.  I was surprised
. 
 
I didn't know they wer e 
Germ an. A lotof people went out tohear what the noise was. T hen Ifound out that the war 

startedout and theplanes went out.
 
 
T hef if th column o
ut  in c ivi lia n  c lo t h in g,  wit h  wa lk ie

t a lk ie ,
 
they could report 
ever ything to the enemy what's going on, where thePolishArm y is, how m any they have there 
in the Arm y, what kind of  equipm ent they have.  So on and so on.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just so we understand, thef if th column was thenam e given to p
eople of  

Germ an decent who were living in Polandand now were providing all the information to the 
Ge rm an  A rm y. 
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Notthis. T hey spokePolish.  Some of them were caught.T hey were hung, 
all naked. They were not in uniform s.  So they hun
g t h em .
 
 
W hen I  e s c ap ed
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You and your brother were warnedto run away.
 
>> Morris Rosen: W ewere warned to runaway f rom  the Germ an
s
, that they were chasedout 

in Germany. T hey cam e to 
ou r
 
c it y
.  T
hey cam e in. The war started Friday.  The sky was all 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

redf rom  all theartillery and everything to runaway. W e ran away.  
 
 
But theGermans,af ter six days, they caughtus.  So thef irst came,four motorcycles 
with m achine guns. They said, 
ﬁR
ef u gee s .
ﬂ
  
So oneof  the Germanguys says, ok, 
we
 
can go 
home, in beautiful Germ an.  He says, 
ﬁH
ow d o we know so well Germ an?
ﬂ
  
I  sa ys ,  
ﬁW
ell,  I  
went to the university, I'm  aGerman.
ﬂ
  
Says,wait, we can't do nothing.  But the end of the 
columnf rom  the soldiers, they would take. That's what happened.
 
 
W hen we came home,f inally, afterf our days,walkin g back hom e, wef ound out that 
so many Jews were kill ed already on the way going hom e. T hat's what started out. And right 
away, occupied the 3rd of Septem ber.  Only threedays.  It'sonly, by car, 20 m in
utes f rom  the 
Germ an border.
 
 
Right awa y, we can'tm eet any
 
m ore than two, three people.  Jews have to walk on 
the street, not on the pavem ent.  And schools were closed up.  Anybody caught with weapons 
or something, we would be punished by death.  It was ver y bad.
 
 
Af te r 6:0 0
 
in theevening until 7:00
 
in them orning, nobody could walk on the street.  
It doesn'tmakeany difference.  It was ver y diff icult.
 
 
T hen came orders right away.  I skipped a little bit.T his was already in 
Novem ber
 
1939.  Justthe search, still bloody f rom  thebattles because put up 30
-
day battle.  
More than any other European country.  Andthey started out right awa y with Jews, they have 

to wear arm bands. W e have to wear
,  
f irst, white arm  bands on the lef t hand, Star of David.  
Lat
eron we changed because where we li ved, UpperSilesia, was incorporated into the 
general itself . So we have the same laws as the Germ ans. And we have to write letters
 
--
y
ou 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

have to write everythin g in Germ an. W ehave the Germ an money, not the governme
nt money, 
the Polishm oney, still.  It was ver y diff icult.
  
W e have to stay in line only f or Jewish bakeries.  
Only two bakeries.  It was ver y, ver y diff icult.  But this was not theworst.
 
 
T hen came theorder. Jews have to deliver in so much gold, som uch silver, in order 
to pay f ortheGermanArm y, for the occupation. Peopledidn'thave any gold or anything. It 

was reall y we were about only 5% Jews in our city. W e had 5,000 only.  And there was 50,000 
Pols. W ho had gold? T hey had to give awa y their rings.  You have to buy gold.  You haveto 
deliver so m uch and so much. And this was not the worst. 
 
 
T hen came another order.  I skipped som e. People had to live som any Jews, 
young people to workandthey have to work for the Germ ans.  So they start bu
ilding 
comm unity there. W ehave todoeverything what the German wants.  And inorder to geta 
little bit m ore food
 
--
 
and of  course, m yf ather hadtopay some money
 
--
 
that I should work with 
m y f ather in the bauleitung, the building.  
 
 
First, you have
 
especially ID cards that withyou could wa
lk on the street. W e 
already worked for the Germ ans, so they shouldn't catchus inthe street or send away to 

Germ any.  That's what they didat thattim e. And we had a little additional food, also.
 
My f i rs t  jo b  
was I becam ea 
c
arpenter, apainter, and a bricklayer.  All I did. My f irst job, 

unf ortunately, was in the m arket toput up hanging 
sca f f o ld s 
for 10people. I said this is wrong.
 
>> Bill Benson: T om ake the hanging scaff
olds
. 
>> Morris Rosen:  Yes.  The
 
next day police rather than around
 
--
 
not soldiers but theGerman 
police, they took away IDs from every person, Jew, not Jew, Pols, we have to com eonthe 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

m arket 10: 30 in themorning.  You get back to IDs.  If you don't come that day, you won't get 
IDs, 
you won't getf ood stamps.
 
 
So of course, them arket was packed. W e wait. T hey hada truckload with 10Pols.  
T hey wore m asks. T hey com m itted things against the governm ent
, w
hich it's not true. They 
were condem nedfor hanging.  And the thing what I saw
 
there, the scream sf rom them , "
L on g 
live Poland," "T ake revenge."  And this they did in every cit y in Poland just tom ake surethat 
nobody does sabotage.  And they were picked upf rom  the Polishf oundry in our city, which the 
locomotives for the tanks were built theref or the war.  And during the war they m ade partsfor 
airplanes. T his was the first experience.
 
 
T hen I have to skip to1942. T hey started out a ghetto. Nobody could go outfor the 
ghettoexcept with a special perm anent
.  L
ikeI work only f or the Germ ans, I was f ree to go 
ever ywhere with m y special ID card. 
 
 
Cam eanorder that allthe girls between12 years and 25 have to register that 
they're going to be working in the shop, potato shop there. And they have special IDs.  But the 

thing was
 
wrong.  T hey cam e to the Jewish comm unity there where450, all the young 
generation in our city, Jewish gi rls, and cam e thereand said send them to work. T hey took 

them  to atransition cam p.  W efound out where they are.  Som y f ather went there. He 
th o
ught he knows people, he can take you out.  Nobody could tell. 
 
T hey took the girls and 
shipped them  away.  W e didn't know where. 
 

 
You can im agineour hom e, a 12
-
year
-
old girl , it was like com ing hom eaf tera 
funeral.  My m other was cryin g.  My f ather showed thebitterness. Ever ybody was terrible.

Andf inally, af ter two weeks, wef ound out
 
--
 
we got f irst postcardthat she works in Lower 
Silesia in af actory where they makem aterials.  She works 12 hourswith the machine walki ng 
forward and back
 a
nd gi ves
 
to levenstein.  
 
 
W e un de r s t o od
 
they were the two Jewish bakeries
 
that they couldonly bake bread 
fo r th e Je ws.  T
he Jews couldn't buy any other place bread.
  
So m ym other baked up whatever 
she could. It wasn't easy until you got somef lour on the back market, which wasn't allowed.  

You got caught, you get shot. She made out some packages. It was allowed to sendonce a 
m ontha package. And I went to the postoff ice because m ine ID, could walk everywhere 
because I workedf or the highest, highest Germ an 
of f ic ia ls  th a t e xis t e d  in S ile s ia
, o
nly for 
t h em .
  
This was not the worst.  
 
 
Cam e August
 
12, 1942, again
 c
am e order:  Ever y Je w has to register near the 
Jewish com munity, to be thereat 5:00
 
in them orning. And you know in August how hot it is in 
Poland.
  
5 : 00
 
with the rest of thef amilies. W e are going to getnew IDs.  You don't get IDs, 
you won't get any
 
--
 
and the Jewish comm unity, either way, the head of  the Jewish comm unity 
putup clothing, look presentable. W e were there 5:00
 
i n t he m o r n i ng.   T he 
heat was 
unbearable.  Kids were crying.  People were pantingf rom  thirst.  You couldn't go out until 

8:00
 
in them orning.  
 
 
8:00
 
in them orning, said to myself , oh, som ething doesn't look right.  I saw soldiers 
with m achine guns on the roofs all around th
e comm unity.
  
T hen came two trucks with SS and 
a com m ission which at that time I workedfor the highest off icialf rom theSS that was 

responsiblef or sending out the Jews, Auschwit z, which I don't know what Auschwitz m eant at

th e  tim e
.  W
e didn't know, but
 
he was responsible. T here shouldbe no Jews in the citiesno 
m ore in all Silesia.  I workedfor him atthe time.
 
 
W hen I was there, they put uptables and everybody, the headof thefam ily have to 
stay f irst. Theelder people, like over 45, goto the right. T othe lef twere the ones with IDs, 
thatI workedf or them ,to the left. And the center were youngsters,barely able to walk.  But 
they don't have IDs yet.  It tookuntil10:00. 10:00
 
they got all the Jews to the right:  
w
om en, 
children, m en, and t
hey chased them  to Bedzin.
 
 
W edidn'thave the keys to thehouse oranything.  My f ather had everything.  Then 
we had to sleep outside.  W e couldn't get into our apartm ent.  In them orning Ifoundout where 

they are. I went onf oot.  Ididn't want totake
 
the street car, though 
I 
had a special ID.  I was 
af raid. It wasn't too far, abouta half
-
hour I was there in the next city.   
 
 
Com ethere.  It was only Je wish police thereguarding them . I cam e up,and I saw 
they didn't letm e in
.  
I said, 
ﬁ
I don't hav
e the key.
ﬂ
  
And I saw they want Jewish policem enf rom  
our city.  I only need to takethe keys. T akeonly a m inute. And when I came up, I saw the 
sceneat thetop I will never f orget in m y life. People were tearing their hair out. T hey knew 
what's going on.  Andm y f ather gave me thekeys to the house, gave me hispocket wat
c h .  
My m other cried.  He says don'tforget m y sister who was already in cam p. T his isthe last

I came back to work ri ght away.  I went to the sam eone.  Andm y old

On the third day, I walked home separate and m y brother. W e shouldn't be all in 
one p
lace.  Ididn't go to the city home but to thef ield.  I cam e to thef ield there andI see
 
--
 
one 
wai ved to me.  His son was m y bestf riend.  And I wa
i
ved back. So I saw that this was a 
transport going away.  I didn't know where. 
  
So there was police, SS
, o n the  top  of the  tra in .  
T hey started shooting at m e because I waive d. T here was a ravine, so I jumped in. Lucky m e, 
I jumped in there. I waited 10m inutes. ThenI went hom e.
 
 
I went hom e. W e didn't even have tim eto cry
.  T
his was just bef orethe 
high 
holidays. W e got the sensethat we got tom ove into the ghetto. Our part of the city didn't go 
to the ghetto yet. W ewent to the ghetto. There was only youngsters lef t
f
or prayers, nobody 
to pray. W hoprayed?W e cried.  
 
 
Somebody looked atpoli
ce .
  
So they gave us one little room , 16people.  Nine girls 
and seven boys.  A little room . Thepoor section of our city.  Nof loor.  So we have to get som e 

straw to putdownf or the girls.  And one of the wom en was like a distant cousin.  She was 
pregna
nt.  Yes, at thattim e. And we sleptontheoutside. W hen it rained, we stood in the 
foyer because we didn't even have room toturn around. And what could you take? W e didn't 
have work. W e tookour books and so on.  He was a collectorof  these item s
; 
s
om e  be d d i ng,  
som e clothing. T he rest we have to leave the house everything wha t it is.  You couldn't take 

with us.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to jum p inf or a m inute.T he one thing that I think you hung on to 

were som e photographs.

Photographs
,  
about200 photographs.  And still f rom  m y f irst girlf riend that Ihave ina different 
city.  I kept this right in f ront of it, with m yf am ily pictures, organizations, everything. 
 

 
T hen we cam eto the ghetto. Like Itold you,we slept outside whenit rains
;  
in s ide  
we stood. Af terone week only I
 
get invitation f rom the Jewish comm unity. T hey handedm e 
ticketsf orthetrain with a special pass on the train and go to Szczakowa, a le
a th
erf actory.  I 
went to the train.  Itook all m y pictures. T hat's all I took,and som e things.  And I came there,
 
buton thetrain Inoticed one girl andneighbor.  She was thedaughter of  the principalf rom  the 
school. And she shook like I shouldn't com eover to heror nothing.  I noticed shehad a 
Jewish kid that she took somewhere probably for hiding. I cam e there.  It was a leather 
factory.  And all we have to eat was dry f ood, what the Jewish comm unity sent us
a
nd bread
.  
I 
was picked with another guy becauseI spoke very good Polish.  And we went once a week to 

thebakery. W e got bread, about 60breadsfor the weekfor us. 
 
 
And suddenly, af ter two weeks, we didn't getany m orefood there.So what 
happened,SS came 5:00
 
inthe morningf or us.  W e went aday before a church. Andf
rom  the 
church Ihear a whistle
 
come over. W asa Jewish guy hiding.  He says
:  
L
eave the breads 
here. I know who you are. W eare going to go through the church. Nobody knows we are 
here. ThePolish woman, shebring you food.  I said no
;  
the peopleare starving.  W ehave to 
take thebread.  Maybe tom orrow.  But5:00
 
in the m orning
 
the SS cam efor us.

W hat happened? It was no more Jews
 i
n allSilesia.  Everybody was transport
ed
.  
No Jews at all.
 
 
Som y partner,electrician, very f ine, intelligent guy, he was m issing.  He we
n
t with  
m efor bread. He probably jum ped out the wind
ow
 
andprobably we nt to the church. ButI 
don'tthinkhe survi ved.  Otherwise I would have f ound him af ter thewar. 
 
 
Ok. W e come there, cam e SS for us. T herewas a young wom an about 23 years 
old.  Herhusband was theonly Jewish engineer there. T hey couldn't lose him  becausehe 
was the only engineerthat knew everything.  But he went to see hisbrother.  Hedidn't come 
back. Sothere was no m ore Jews.
 
 
T he police took us.  His wife, a young wom an with a young kid, 2 years old only, I 
helped her carrying the baby.  She tookher suitcase.  And then I have pictures that Ifound 
while I worked f or the SS men. W e goton the thirdf loor to put up heavy cases.  And onecase 
broke. It was so heavy.  Pictures cam eout. Andall the pictures were Jews hanging, bu

So since he was so nice to m e, I stood at attention.  Like this. And Ibegged him.  I 
don'thave nobody f rom  my f am ily.  I only have one sisterand she is in camp.  Can you send

It's a wom an's cam p. First I go to a transition camp. I won't tell anything.  Toohard 
tom ention.T hen about a week later cam ea transport to go toGruen
be r g.   I  am  not o n  the  l i s t .   
I knew where he went in.  I am  not on the list.
  
So I jumped over thefence.  It wasn'telectrif ied.  
I knockedat thedoor. And whata picture.  He laid in his only underpants, no shirt,nopants, 

buthis boots. [Speaking Germ an]
 
 
I said, youprom isedme I'm going to Gruenberg.  I'm  not on the list.
  
ﬁ

I we n t 
like a little doggy behind him tothef ence. He tore up the list. Nobody goes. 
 
 
So what happened, Ifound out, there was one Jew, Dr.

they says, well, you think you arebetter person? You're still a Jew.  He got such a beating 
ever y day.  It was only Jewish couples. Only Jews.
  
He was bloody all over.  He paid somuch 
there to go outf rom here becausehe knew he was going to get killed there. And he tookm y 

place. That's what happened.  But we only went threepeople went to Gruenberg.
 
 
Cam e on the train, everybody f rom  the tr

with the Germ ans together. Tookabout two hours on train. W e came toGruenberg. W ho 
was with it?  Theeldest of the Jews in thetransition camp

W earrived there. They brought about18 Jews, m en,f rom anothercam p they

And there was a nice, little oldm an,old German. Sohe said tom e

by the SS sohehad alot of food to eat. Buton the Death March, he didn't have food so 
they're theones that diedf irst. Theones thatwere used to hunger, they held out.  So he was

 T
