A: Sorry, I didn™t. 
Q: Okay. We had a slight glitch, I thi
nk we™re okay now. Wher
e did you grow up? 
A: Well, I grew up in
 Boch um
 and we lived there until we left for the 
United States
. 
Q: What was the town like? Was 
it a big city, or a small town? 
A: It was a medium sized city, which has si
nce grown to a popula
tion of over 400,000. 
It was a grimy industrial coal 
mining and manufacturing city.  
Q: Did your fami ly have a long history in 
Germany
? 
A: Yes, quite. There are severa
l generations and -- in western 
Germany
. 
Q: Were there many Jews in your town? 

A: There were ha -- accounted fo r in the 
general congregation, something over 1100, 
of whom about four came back after the war.  

Q: Before the war, before 
Hitler
 came to power, what were the relationships like 
between the Jews and the non-Jews in your town ? 

A: Apparently peaceful enough. My fa
ther represented the miner™s u n ion. 
Q: Was your family re
ligiously observant? 
A: Not extremely so. The major holid
ays, yes, but among the Jews in 
West
 
Germany
, 
things were sort of loose, but we were 
memb ers of the congregation and I attended the 
Jewish school.  

Q: Did you have a favorite ho
liday , and if you did, why? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider

A: I guess the two favorite ones were Passover and 
Ha nukka h. 
For Passover we often 
went to grandparents who kept th
eir ma tzos in a big barrel, and 
Hanukka h 
fo r 
obvious reasons. 
Q: Well, not so obvious. What were your favorite reasons? 
A: Mostly -- oh, gifts. 

Q: When you were a child, di
d you personally ever see 
Hitler
? 
A: Never saw him, but when we were at
 school, the Nazis would come by an d make 
sure that we were sitting at our desks in 
our best clothes, listening to the speech es. 
Q: When  you th ink back to your child
hood, can you rememb er any personal 
experiences that you had with anti-Semitism in 
Germany
? 
A: Well, things began to 
boil up very quickly after
 Hitler
 took power. The people who 
owned th e house in wh ich we rented an apar
tment, their o -- late teens to early 20™s 
sons were among th e first je -- to join th
e party. They paraded around in their brown 
shirts. Some of the children in
 the neighborhoo
d joined the 
Hitlerjugend,
 the 
Hitler 
Youth. And of course there was always th
e spectacle of the marches up and down. We 
lived on the corner of
 a main street, and the spectacle 
of the parades up and down  with 
the flags, the music, th e torches, and get 
away from that window
. The atmosphere of 
fear. 

Q: Do you have any memo ries
 of your childhood before
 the Nazis began to gain 
power? Do you have any fo nd memo
ries of your early ch ildhood in 
Germany
?

A: I guess just a normal childhood. Playing in the park and learning to ice skate, 
playing with other children. It didn™t take lo
ng though, before this
 atmosphere of fear 
set it. Very early, probably in 
1933, we™d began to have what
 in retrospect I find very 
surprising, blackout drills. Had to put curt
ain -- not curtains, but blankets on the 
windows, don™t turn on any lights. Cars 
down below had to paint th eir head -- 

headlights blue. And in retrospect, in the 
early 30™s, I find this very surprising. 

Q: Was there any explanation for this? 
A: That was the way it was done. I was yo
ung enough not to know any real reason. 
The other thing was the so-called
 Winterhilfe. 
Once a week people were required to 
have a meal that was prepared in one pot, 
and the amount of money that was saved, 
presumably, by having a thick so
up or something of that sort, was to be given to the 
poor. Du ring the winter the Nazis would co
me knocking on th e door, peek in the pots, 
and collect what you presumab
ly saved. To this day I do 
not like to eat pea soup or 
lentil soup, for that reason.  

Q: Did your parents try to ex
plain any of the Nazi related even ts to you wh en  they 
began? I-I realize you were young, but did they
 try in any way to explain the situation 
to you? 

A: They tried to shield me as
 much as possible, but my fa
ther, who is a -- really a -- a 
person who saw things that were coming, and he
 tried to persuade others that it wasn™t

just a passing fad, and when  he was fired and 
no longer allowed to practice, he said it™s 
time to go. 
Q: Why was he fired? 
A: For being Jewish. 
Q: When  you th ink back
 to the events when 
Hitler
 came to power, do you rememb er 
some of the first signs that things were 
changing? Do  you rememb er it building in any 
way, or all of a sudden is it ju
st in your mind as all around you? 
A: It didn™t take long, but th
e young people who liv
ed in this building, showing up in 
their Nazi uniforms, other people and pushi
ng people around. My father was arrested 
for no good reason. His law partner was beat
en up in an alley 
and left for dead. 
Fortunately he wasn™t and managed to emigrate to 
Israe l
 in later years. But when 
things began to happen that way,
 he said it was time to get out.  
Q: Once he decided it was time to go, 
what efforts did he make to leave 
Germany
? 
A: Well, we were more fortunate than most
. My mo ther had a sist
er who came to live 
in the 
United States
 with her family following Worl
d War I. And they invited my 
father to come to the 
United States
, look around fo r a few weeks and see if it was 

possible to come and possibly make a living 
and then  decide to apply for a visa. And 
they then  signed an affidavit for us that permitted us to come into this country .  

Q: How long did the process take from when
 he first decided to come until you got the 
paperwork all in order? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider

A: Probably  someth
ing over a year.  
Q: During this time did anyone try to st
op you or make it difficult for you to leave 
Germany
? 
A: I don™t really know about 
that, there are family
 members who said, oh don™t just run 
off, it™s going to stop, it will all be over. And 
my father said, I don™t think it will stop. 
And he made up his mind and he is fort
unate, some members of his family were 
fortunate to get out. Others were not so fort
unate, were lost. Both my father™s family 
and mother™s family. 

Q: During that time between when he made
 up his mind that he was going to  leave 
Germany
 and you were waiting for the paperwor
k, you said it was about a year, how 
were things changing in 
Germany
 during that year? 
A: I would say it was just mo re of the sa
me. More of the marches up and down the 
street, mo re of your child laughed at that
 -- a-a-at our man in uniform, you™re gonna 
get in trouble. Or just watch very carefully
 wh ere you walk, how you walk. Stay out of 
trouble. Just don™t call attenti
on to yourself in any way.  
Q: What was happening in  your life during this time, before you left 
Germany
 in that 
year, or a little more th
an a year from when 
Hitler
 came to power, until you left. What 
were you doing in your life? 

A: I was a school kid, and so me of the fam
ilies there were also hoping to get out. But 
o-others were still ready to tough 
it out and see what wo uld happen .

Q: You mentioned before that 
you went to the Jewish school, did I hear you co rrectly? 
A: Yes. The kinderg arten and th e scho
ol were both burned down later on 
Kristallnacht. 
Q: But while you were still in 
Germany
, was there any problem with attending a 
Jewish school? 
A: No, it was not shut down until after I had 
left. And at that time my teacher made it 
her business to teach those children that 
were still there even
 after the school 
disappeared. She taught them in a house, a 
Juden
 house and then  she began smuggling 
them, at great risk to hers
elf, across the border into the 
Netherlands
. 
Bo chum
 is not 
far from the Dutch border. And she manage
d to get out quite a number of -- of 
children, although she herself 
was later deported and died.  
Q: It -- do you have any other memo ry that
 sticks out in your mind from that time, 
before you left, in that y
ear or so before you left 
Germany
? 
A: It was mostly sort of apprehension. As
 a matter of fact, where would we go? My 
parents were beginning to study conversationa
l Hebrew in case we couldn™t get into 
the 
United States
. I had a little bit of Hebrew in scho
ol of course, but that was prayer 
book Hebrew, and no English whatever. 
Q: Did your parents speak any English? 
A: Yes. In their professions, they 
were multilingual. No
-Not very good 
conversationally, but most e
ducated people in those days knew some French, some

English. My  mo ther being a singer, had to
 a-at least know how to pronounce Italian. 
My father, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, in a
ddition to English, French, German. 
Q: Did you have any doubts or
 reservations about leaving 
Germany? 
Di-Did you 
want to stay? 
A: I was young enough to just do what my  
parents wanted me to do, and there was 
enough fear there that it coul
dn™t be any worse in the 
United States
.  
Q: Do you remember when  
your parents told you that now is the time to leave? 
A: Well, the preparations were ongoing. 
So then I began to read a little bit about 
America
. I thought I would find Indian s, and my
 father had visited the relatives who 
lived, at the time in 
Chevy Chase, D.C.
, and he said it™s next to
 Maryland
. I pictured 
a little gate goi
ng from the 
District of Colu mbia
 into
 Ma ry la nd
. So I didn™t really 
know what to expect. 

Q: What did you take with you and wh
at did your parents take with them? 

A: Well they were allowed to take a few th
ings which a lot of pe
ople later -- in later 
years were not. So, a few items of furniture
, they were allowed 
to take books, my 
mo ther™s music and some of my  favorite books,
 a doll. And tha -- that™s it. I w anted to 
get rid of the German looking 
clothes as fast as I could. 
Q: Do you reme mb er saying
 good-bye to people? Were 
you allowed to do that? 
A: Yes, I -- as a matter of fact I have 
a page in my autograph book, written by the 

schoolteacher that I mentioned before. And 
yes, of course, we took our leave of

friends, that was still permitted in those days
, and the grandparents 
in a nearby city, the 
grandmother. The grandfather had died many
 years before. And a-an uncle -- those 
people -- Grandmother died of na
tural causes, the uncle died in 
Gross-Rosen
, in the 
camp. 
Q: When ? 

A: I™m not sure of the year. I tried to find 
that out in the -- in 
the museum library, but 
they didn™t have the year. One of 
my father™s brothers was listed as 
fashon
, which 
means assu med dead. He was 
deported, but they don™t kn
ow the actual date. One of 
my  mo ther™s brothers, a younger br
other, we managed to bring to the 
United States
 
with his family. An older brother lived thro
ugh mo st of the war, but managed to come 
to the 
United States
. My father™s oldest brother 
was deported and killed. Another 
brother escaped to 
South Africa
. And another brother was incarcerated in 
Dachau
 for 
a number of months, but was released and managed to co me to the 
United States
 with 
his family. My father also 
work ed on bringing over as ma ny 
people as he could of the 
family. With some he was succes
sful, in others he was not. 
Q: For those that he was not successful 
in bringing over, do yo
u know why he was 
unsuccessful on those attemp ts? 
A: Probably  just bureaucracy, paperwork. 
By that time these people had been deported 
and you couldn™t even find mo st of them. 
Q: Would you, fo r the record, give me the na
me of the teacher that you told us about?

A: Oh yeah, her name was 
Ilse Hi rsch, H-i-r -s-c-h.
 When we read names on 
Yom 
HaShoah 
in the museum, she is a lwa
ys on my list to read. 
Q: At the time that you were getting 
ready to leave an-and now leaving 
Germany
, 
what was the reaction of the Jewish community
? At -- at this point when you left, were 
they still -- were th
ey becoming afraid? 
A: Some people, like us, were getting ready 
to leave. Others were still trying to make 
it somehow or another. So th-the reacti
on was mixed. Ther-There™s no monolithic 
reaction. 

Q: When  ex actly did you leave 
Germa ny
? 
A: In 1934, in June. We went by train to the 
Netherlands
. My mo th er had a friend in 
Amsterdam
, and when  we crossed 
the border into the
 Netherlands
 and everybody 
took a deep breath, we™re out
 of there. We stayed in 
Amsterdam
 for a day or tw o, then  
went to 
Rotterdam,
 took a boat across the English ch
annel. We were down in -- way 
down in the bottom, next to 
the machinery in that boat, ge
tting very seasick. We went 
from 
Lo ndo n
 to a port that the Br
itish pronounce, I think 
Ha rrich, 
it™s spelled 
Harwich. 
And from there we took a smallish steamboat called 
The Corinthia
, that 
took a little over a week to get to 
New York. The Corinthia
 was subsequently sunk 
during World War II. 

Q: You™ve mentioned that on th e trai
n when  you cross the border out of 
Germany
, y-
you heaved a sigh of relief. Who were
 the other passengers with you? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider

11
A: Well, my parents. The other people we -- 
we didn™t know. Just people on the train. 
Q: You don™t know if
 they were Jewish? 
A: No, I do not.  
Q: What were your expectations, besides th
at you thought you™d see Indians and you™d 
see gates, b u t what were your expect
ations of the Americans an-and what 
America  
would be like in terms of other issues
? Did you have any idea in your mind? 
A: Not too many, although the relatives who ga
ve us the visa -- or the affidavit, they 
had a daughter five years older than I fro
m whom I had occasionally gotten a box of 
American clothes and I couldn™t wait to be American. 
Q: Do you reme mb er your 
first impressions of the 
United States
 when you first 
started seeing 
America
? 
A: Well, the first thing that™s
 always pointed out to ev er
yone, wh en you go into  the 
harbor, 
Statue of Liberty
. Take a good look at that. Also
, at that time, people were not 
going th rough 
Ellis Island
. The immigration people we
re coming on the ship. The 
ship landed late in the day.
 The relatives were on the dock
 waiting to  meet us and we 
took the midnight train -- 
that was cheaper -- from 
New York
 to
 Wash ington
. And 
from there we went to the ho -- my 
mother™s sister and her family. 
Q: When  you first started meeting Ameri
cans who were not your
 relatives, how did 
they treat you? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
12
A: Well, the first few weeks we lived with
 -- with our relatives. There were -- there 
was a set of twins there, cousins, who were 
four years old, who gave me a terrible time 
because I couldn™t speak English. Then we 
moved into our own ap
artment, also in 
Washin gton. 
And I was very shy and retiring be
cause nobody would speak to me, I 
couldn™t speak to them. So 
it took awhile, but we came
 in the summertime and it 
wasn™t long before I was enro
lled in the local elementary 
school. That was a trau matic 
experience also, especially sinc
e I was tall for my age and th
ey wanted to put me back 
a grade because I couldn™t speak English. I fo
ught like crazy to not be put back another 
year. I finally succeeded in th
at, and worked very hard to
 try and pick up enough 
English to go on. My bridge to
 English were numbers. A four 
is a four is a four in no 
matter what language, and if I could manipulat
e those, then pick 
up a little bit more 
each time. A very kind teacher 
put a book in front of me w
ith a map, and then she said, 
geography. North, south, eas
t, west, pointing at the di
rections. And little by little I 
picked up some English. The running joke in
 my family is a spe
lling word on my first 
spelling test. These days the children can spe
ll mu ch  mo re co mp lica t
ed words, but that 
was Queen. I spelled it 
k-w-i -n. 
Q: How long did it take you befo re yo
u were fairly fluent in English? 
A: Oh, I™d say it takes n -- more than a 
year. The year -- the 
su mmer  fo llo win g  th at 
first year. In those days the school years were divided into  two halves, 
A
 and 
B
 and 
you could move -- you could en ter school in
 the spring semester, for instance. So I

went to summer school after that first y
ear, made up one seme st
er, and then  had a 
combined second half 
of fifth grade, first half of si
xth grade. Went to summer school 
again the following year, and that way I 
got even with others
 in my age group. 
Following that I went to summer school 
in high school, made up another year and 
graduated at 16.  
Q: When  you first started going to school
 and first started m
eeting people, did you 
experience any anti-foreign or
 anti-Semitic sentiments? 
A: Not so much anti-Semitic, but
 anti-foreign. They
 -- they made fun of me and I said 
the wrong things and they pushed me ar
ound. It was not as common to have non-

English speaking children in the schools th
en as it is now. There was no English as a 
second language, and I-I just had to make do. 

Q: While you were ma king these transiti
ons to American public school, how were 
your parents transitioning to  life in the 
United States
? 
A: It -- it™s a matter of trying to make a 
living. We lived not too far from where the 
Bureau of Standard s used to be located, 
and su -- in those days, if you were doing 
anything at all in science, you had to know
 German. So my  father gave some private 
lessons in German. He also managed to ge
t a job in th e liquor store as a bookkeeper. 
My mo ther also gave some lessons and th
en  she began to teach mu sic. And th at 
brought forth enough to pay the groceries. Bu
t it was sti ll pretty hard to make ends

meet. I used to be so  envious of children th
at I saw with an ice cream cone, because we 
couldn™t afford it. 
Q: I™m going to pause and ch ange the tape, just one minute. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: -- view with 
Lore Schneider
. This is tape number one, side 
B.
 And before I co-
continue with my line of qu
estioning from before, I wanted 
to go back and ask you one 
mo re question ab out 
Germa ny
. I had asked you if your family had a long history 
there, but what I didn™t ask you was if your 
father ever served in  the German military. 
A: Yes, he did, as did his brother. Th
ey were on active duty, and I have a -- a 
certificate that indicated that my father  got a service cross for his trouble. 

Q: While you first were here, in the fi
rst couple of months and years in the 
United 
States
, were you able to stay in touch 
with family and friends inside of 
Germany
? 
A: Yes, there was one school friend and we
 exchanged a couple of postcards before 
things got bad and we
 could no longer corresp ond. My 
parents corresponded with their 
family as long as they  were able. 

Q: What kinds of informati
on did you get about life in 
Germany
 from this 
correspondence that you were getting? 

A: Well, we got the account of people, the 
Nazis, breaking into the -- my father™s 
family business. They broke th
e windows, they threw the merchandise out in the street.

They  beat up his brother and then  they 
said, you have to  pay fo r the damage. The 
younger brother was a physicia
n they beat up, and he was 
on his way to see patients. 
Actually he, at one time had been
 the doctor to th
e workers on the 
Co log n e 
cathedral. 
But he was in his car, going to se
e a patient when they  began, on 
Kristallnacht
 
wrecking ev erything in sight. They tried to
 set his car on fire with him in it. He 
managed to get out of the car. They dragge
d him off, first to jail and then to the 
concen tration camp in 
Dach au
. He was there for a number of months, but -- and I 
have an account of his experiences in 
Dach au
. My father, after he came to this country 
insisted that he retell everything as well as
 he remembered it. My
 father said, if you 
don™t tell it as you remember it, n o body will ev
er believe that this really happened. 
Later on he was able to 
bring the family to the 
United States
. Another brother escaped 
to 
South Africa
. On my mother™s side, the 
one brother escaped first to 
France
, then 
he was underground for a number of years, came to the 
United States
 after the war. 
The brother who continued the family busin
ess for a time was dragged off and killed 
in the concentration camp at 
Gross-Rosen
. The youngest brother and his family, who 
had been living in
 Berlin, 
they managed, again with the he
lp of my  parents, to come 
out and they came to the 
United States
. 

Q: You gave me an accountin
g of many of the me mb ers of 
your family, but you didn™t 
say anything about a grandparent. What
 was going on with that generation? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003

A: The only grandpar
ent that was still a
live was my mother™s 
mother and she died 
soon after we came to the 
United States
, of natural causes. 
Q: And she never had any in
terest in coming to the 
United States
? 
A: She had spent a number of years in the 
United States
 in the late 19
th
 century in the 
backwoods of 
Tennessee. 
They lived there for several 
years, but it was strict ly 
backwoods. She was frightened of the bears 
that would come under the house and sh e 
insisted that they go 
back to city life in 
Germany
. The first three of her children were 
born in the 
United States
. My mother was the four
th, and she was born in 
Germany
. 
Q: Do you know what 
they were doing in 
Tennessee
, why they had moved th ere? 
A: I™m not sure why they had mo ved there,
 but they had a small business, and my  
grandfather was actually the postmaster. In 
those days, post offices were housed in 
stores, not their own building, especially
 in small, backw
oods communities. My 
husband and I, by th e way, wh en we
 were first married, lived in 
Tennessee
 and we 
took an excursion to 
Elbridge
 just to see what it looked 
like and it was still a wide 
place in the road
 back then. 
Q: Let™s go back to your schooling. Wh
ere did you go to school, and wh at do you 
remember about the subjects that you stud
ied? Was there anything that you liked? 
A: Well, in 
Germany
 I went to the Jewish school. Of co urse we learned our
 ABC™s
 
and there was a different kind of writing be
fore the cursive writi
ng, it was very mu ch 
pointy, after the printing. Also, in th e begi
nning, instead of writing on paper, we wrote

with a slate. We had to carry a slate and 
a damp  sponge with us, and something to 
mark -- it wasn™t chalk -- to ma
rk on this slate. After the first year, then we graduated 

to paper. Also, after hours, the girls were tau
ght one year to croche
t, another year to do 
embroidery and by the time they got around
 to knitting, I had left. The boys were 
given a little bit of traini
ng with w
oodworking. 
Q: What about in the 
United States
? Where did you go to school in this country? 
A: I went to an elementary school in 
Washington
, followed that up 
with a junior high 
school, also in 
Washington,
 and ended up at 
Woodro w Wilson 
High School in 
Washin gton
. And then 
George Washin gton 
University. 
Q: After you learned English,
 did you make many friends? 
A: I was still pretty shy, I -- I somehow didn™t
 begin to fit in until I was in high school, 
even though I tried very hard . I spoke recen
tly to a woman that I have known since the 
first day that we started to school, and what
 I didn™t know until r
ecently is that in a 
way she sort of resented my  wo rking so  
hard all the time, trying to catch up with 
everyone else. And she said, in the end 
you passed me, didn™t 
you? You graduated 
from high school a year ahead 
of me. I didn 't  realize that she resented it at the time. 
Q: Were you in school w
ith other Jewish students? 
A: There were very few in the elementary. In
 the junior high sch
ool and high school, 
yes, there were others, and that™s when I began to make friends. At 
George

Washin gton,
 in my  freshman year, I went full time. Then I took a job and finished the 
rest at night.  
Q: During your days in elementary school
, and in to junior high school and -- you 
know, and beyond, did you pa
y much attention to events
 that were going on in 
Germany
? Again now, I™m talking about befo
re 1939, before the war. Were you 
paying attention to what was happening? 

A: I know my  parents were very conscious of
 it, they talked abou
t it a lot. But I was 
very busy trying to catch up 
with school work, to stay 
abreast of fellow students my 
own age, and trying to become American. 
It was not until high school that -- and then 
later on in college, of course -- I gr
aduated from high school in 1941. 
Q: I™m going to ask you if 
you know -- if you can rememb
er any specific events, like 
perhap s the 
Berlin
 Olympics. Did you have any memo
ry of -- of watching that from -- 
from the American perspective? 
A: No, and of course that was before the days
 of television, so all we got was wh at was 
on th e radio or in th e newspa
per, and everybody heard about 
Jesse Owens
. My 
English -- a lot of spoken English 
came from listening to people like 
J a c k Benny . 
From people like -- programs like 
J a c k Benny
 and also 
Little Orphan Annie
, I 
learned a lot of spoken English. 

Q: Were you even  aware of the book burnin gs, or the 
Nuremberg 
Laws as they were 
being enacted? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
19
A: Only in so far as th ey 
were talked about in the fa
mily, and the entire time, my 
father, after -- he took out his first papers by
 the way, first -- after three years, at that 
time you could take out first papers that -- 
with which you declar
ed your intention to 
become citizens. He was then
 allowed to be employed by 
the government, and he had 
then a regular job. An d anyone th at would liste
n, he tried to get help for bringing other 
members o f the family  to the 
United States
. And this is where a lot of information 
came from. 
Q: What was his job when  he finally got the papers? 
A: He -- well, basically, economist. People who studied law in 
Euro pe, 
it™s a different 
system and they could not pr
actice here and he felt he wa
s too old to go back to  law 
school and learn American la
w. And besides, it cost too 
mu ch. So  he -- but he had a 
very broad, general educati
on, so that permitted him to
 work as an economist, and 
since the war was approaching, he was able
 to fill in a lot of information about 
industrial production, coal mining and the like from -- in 
Germany
 because th at had 
been his background, even
 when  he was a lawyer 
for the coalminer™s union. 
Q: What about 
Kristallnacht
? How was that reported in this country? 
A: Not too many papers, not -- they -- there 
are many reports on it now, in the -- in the 
mu seum. There was also a report in the local newspaper and local -- but wh at we were 

getting was mostly from letter
s an d accounts that other people had -- they were 
comp aring notes.

Q: What about the 
anschluss
? When you heard about the 
anschluss
, what was your 
reaction? I mean, what did your parents say? 
A: 
Austria
, 
Czechoslovakia
, and it wasn™t that much 
longer til the Nazis invaded 
Poland
, and -- but th e -- I think the invasion of 
Poland
, that to me was, for all intents 
and purposes the beginning of Wo rld War II
. The -- there was a su mmer camp in the 
Mary land
 mountains that™s still in existence called Camp
 Louise. 
They offered a not 
comp lete but very reduced price camper-ship 
to the refugee kids, and I was in camp at 
the time of the invasion of 
Poland
, but we all heard about it. 
The -- also -- again, there 
were not too many refugee children in the 
Wa sh ing t on  
area at the time we came. 
Washin gton
 Hebrew offered me a -- a scholarsh
ip to their Sunday school. A real
 
mensch
 of a rabbi named Rabbi
 Simon 
did that, but the ladies of the sisterhood, at that 
time were n o t too sy mpathetic. One of the pe
ople, she actually came out and said, well 
it™s the fault of those German Jews. My mo
ther never would go to  another meeting. 
Q: What was the fault of the German Jews? 

A: The trouble that the German Jews are in in 
Germany
.  
Q: Oh, so sh e was blaming the 
victims, is that what you -- 
A: Yes, mm-hm. That was the -- at least pa
rtially, the nature of that congregation. 
They were mostly well-to-do 
business people or professi
onals. They had no problems 
in the 
United States
, so the Jews in 
Germany
 must have done it themselves. But the 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider

21
rabbi was a 
mensch
, said we want to educate this ch
ild, let her in. And I wanted very 
much to go.  
Q: With that mindset, that perhaps it wa
s something that the Jews were doing 
themselves to create anti-Se
mitism, did you ever experience that from -- from y our 
family or from your community? 

A: No, except that my mother always had th
e fear that I™m going to do something to 
turn people against me  and against Jews. Wh
enever I left the house, now don™t go out 
and make anti-Semitism. Don™t dress in flamboyant clothes, don™t dress in too bright 

colors. Don™t be loud. Just stay
 in the background and you™ll 
stay out of trouble. This -
- even in the 
United States
. 
Q: After the invasion of 
Poland,
 during th e war -- during th e war years, did you 
experience any anti-German or anti-Semitic 
feelings? This is during the war years. 

A: Well there™s a difference between anti-Ge
rman and anti-Semitic by that time. And 
of course people were making anti-German 
remarks. They had names for Germans, 
Krauts and th -- you name it, but at that poi
nt I was old enough to  know that that didn™t 
apply to me. 
Q: Did people in the 
United Sta tes
 make the distinction be
tween being German and 
being Jewish from 
Germany
? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
22
A: I™m not really sure, becau
se by that time I was a teen
ager, I was speaking good, 
idiomatic English without an acc
en t, and I just didn™t make a point of it. I just wanted 
to blend in. 
Q: Before I start to ask you about 
Pearl Ha rb or
 and 
America ™s 
involvement in the 
war, is there anything th at stands ou
t in your mind from the invasion of 
Poland
 until 
Pearl Ha rb or? 
Do  you have any memo ries of that 
time that -- that stick out in your 
mind? 

A: Just following th e news very closely. No
w, we personally had 
no ties to anyone in 
Poland
. My father™s law partner 
had been originally from 
Poland
. His wife had been  
British, but they were in 
Germany
, not in 
Poland. 
We personally had no relatives in 
Poland
 whatever. So it was more reading the 
newspapers and tryi
ng to find out what 
we could. 
Q: When  did correspondence between you and your fami ly and friends in 
Germany
 
cease? 
A: It went on for quite awhile. It™s really he
artbreaking, my father™s oldest brother was 
so wanting to get out and the letters were
 -- and th ey all had to adopt the name 
Israel
, 
of course. And there weren™t any sisters, but 
they were all -- they
 all had to be named 
Sarah
. But my father had to keep
 reassuring his oldest brother that he was trying to  
get the permission to get him out, and he 
was unable to do so . The youngest brother 
got out after the incarceration in 
Dach au
, and another brother went to 
South Africa
, 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
23
and his wife had ties to 
Great Britain, 
and 
South Africa
 at that time, was a British 
colony. 
Q: Were you able to keep
 up correspondence until the 
United Sta tes
 got into the war? 
A: I don™t remember w h en the last of th
e letters ceased. By th
at time -- I don™t know, 
most of the correspondence 
was then between my  parents and whoever they could 
correspond with. I was, by that time, attendi
ng the college and -- 
at night and working 
a full time day job. And I had no time for anything.  
Q: What was your fu ll time day job? 
A: Well, right after the war broke out, they
 lowered the age that you could work for 
the government. So I was 17, I took th e t
yping test and I barely passed, but they  
needed  warm bodies to pound thos
e typewriters at -- right after 
Pearl Harbor
, most of 
the young men at the university
 disappeared. They all enlisted or were drafted, and 

equally in  some of the government offices.
 S o  they needed any
body who could operate 
a typewriter. 
Q: Do you reme mb er he
aring th e news about 
Pearl Ha rbor
? 
A: I most certainly do. I was vis
iting with a friend who was also from 
Germany
. She 
had not yet become a citizen. 
I was in her home when they
 made the announcement. It 
was, I think, about three o™clock in the af
ternoon. And she immediately screamed and 
said, that makes me an enemy alien. What 
am I gonna do? Are they going to  ship  me 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider

back? They didn™t, but she wa
s very fearful. By that 
time we had already become 
citizens and I was not that afraid. 
Q: When did you become a citizen? 
A: Oh, five years after we
 got here. At the time the 
Washington Post 
had a reporter at 
the citizenship ceremony and all these people
 had previously gone to wh at was called 
then Americanization school. And they to ok 
some pictures of the ceremony and that 
included a family picture of my parents 
and myself when we became citizens.  

Q: You did say that you were wo rking during 
the day and going to school at night. Did 
that leave any time for you to follow the war news? 
A: On weekends.  
Q: Did you have any id ea what was happening to  the Jews in
 Europe? 
A: Only in so far as ru mors came out. From time to time -- of 
course, my father™s 
brother, who was locked  up in 
Dach au
, this was just a foretaste of what was to come, 
and yes, we heard from this one and that on
e that -- but no one had any id ea how bad it 
really was.  

Q: What stands out in your
 mind about your life from, y ouknow, 1942 until the end of 
the war? Did you stay as a -- a government typist the whole time? 
A: Yes, I learned shorthand and became a st
enographer, got a little more pay. But yes, 
the entire time I was w o rking at the Interior
 Department doing secretarial work and th 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
25
-- the Interior Department was walking distance to the campus of 
George 
Washin gton.
 So five nights a week I was going to  school.  
Q: Do you reme mb er hearing th at the war in 
Europe
 was over? 
A: Abso lutely. It was 
absolute bedlam in 
Washington
. Everyone wanted to  go 
down town. The buses were not
 running and everyone was 
cel -- was celebrating. 
Before that, there were a couple of major ev
ents. One was, for instance, th-the death of 
FDR
. I remember walking from my job to th
e campus and walking with a wo man that 
was taking some of the same classes. This
 woman had absolutely no confid ence in 
Harry Truman. 
She said, isn™t there some w ay 
that the Constitution could be 
changed? What does he know? 
Truman™s 
daughter 
Margaret
 was a cla ssma te of 
mine. She attended one or two classes that I 
did. Several courses were given only at 

night because the professors were work
ing other jobs in the daytime. So 
Margaret
 
was in one or two of the classes that I took. 

Q: Did you know her? 
A: Well, enough to say hello, but not -- 
and when her father 
became president, 
everything changed for her. She then had to
 walk around cam
pus with bodyguards. 
She had to take the elevator
 and -- the elevator alone with her bodyguard s, she could 
no lo nger really pal around with any of the 
students. She had to have these people with 
her.  
Q: What about when  you heard that
 Hitler 
w as dead? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
26
A: Well, the joke is, 
Hitler 
is going to die on the Jewish 
holid ay, cause when  he dies, 
it will be a holid ay. Incidentally, I should ha
ve mentioned this. My father, when he 
was giving German instruction, gave some
 instruction to one
 of the sons of 
FDR
, 
because he thought he was going 
to need it when -- he was in
 the military at the time.  
Q: Did you ever meet the son? 
A: No.  

Q: I think I™m going to pause now and change the tape, just one minute. 
A: Okay . 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: -- of the 
United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer collection 
interview with 
Lore Schneider.
 This is tape two, side
 A, 
and we had been talking 
about the end of the war in 
Europe
. How long after the war 
was over, how long did it 
take before you began to realize 
what had happened  to the Jews in
 Europe
? 
A: When  the 
G.I.™s 
were beginning to come back, my fa
ther had help ed a cousin of his 
to come over from 
Europe
. This cousin had four childr
en, the oldest remained in 
England, 
they were part of the 
Kindertransport.
 A son joined the American army, he 
was injured in the invasion, in the 
D-Day 
in vasion. And through 
him -- and we visited 
him in the veteran™s hospital -- through him we were beginn
ing to hear mo re and mo re 
about what they saw in 
Europe. 
Even though he was wounded right in the beginning, 
through his buddies in the 
army, we found out a lot. 
Q: Was there any reporting of this that 
you can rememb er from the newspapers and 
from newsreels? 
A: There was a certain amount in newsreels, 
but I mu st say I didn™t get to the movies 
very often and the newspaper 
accounts were, for the most
 part, hidden on the back 
page.  

Q: What efforts did your family make af
ter the war to try and find survivors? 
A: Well, they began writing letters, of 
course, and one of the contacts was a 
housekeeper in my  father™s home, to whom 
they had sent care packages all the way 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider

along. Sh e tried her best to find out wh
at happened  to pe
ople there. She was 
unsuccessful. On my  mo ther™s
 family, all we know ab out the brother who died at 
Gross-Rosen
, no one knew wh ere he died, ex cept th
at he did die in a concentration 
camp. I found out the exact location wh en I 
dug in to the archives at the mu seum. 
Q: You were a student during the day, and you were work -- I-I™m sorry, you were 

work ing during the day and you were a stude
nt at night. What were you studying at 
night? What was your ambition, what were your goals? 
A: Originally I had wanted to 
be a teacher, my father talked me out of it, and I studied 
economics. But I was doing secretarial work be
fore I got married an
d also after, until 
our first child was born. When I went back 
to the working world, I became a teacher 
after all. 
Q: As the postwar period moved on, did you fo llow th e 
Nuremberg 
Trials? 
A: Yes, my father went to 
Nuremberg
. The Committee rounded
 up a number of 
lawyers who knew the German law and ma
de them temporary colonels in the 
U.S.
 
Army, and they worked 
on particular cases. They stayed
 for several months, my father 
stayed for about six months. 
So the private in the Germ
an army during World War I 
became a temporary colonel in the 
U.S.
 Army. 
Q: Do you know what case he was work ing on? 

A: Yes, it was a -- a g uy that -- I don™t kno
w what his -- I don™t remember his real 
name now, 
Putzi Hanfstaengel. 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
29
Q: By the time of the 
Nuremberg
 Trials, I™m assuming that most people in the 
United 
States
 knew about what had happened to th e Jews. 
A: Abso  -- absolutely. And -- course, be
fore the war they had people like the 
Bund
 
and Father 
Coughlin
 holding fo rth on the radio and a lo
t of people didn™t believe that 
there was anything really happening there.
 I think there are people today who don™t 

believe it. 

Q: From your perspective as a refugee from 
Germany
, who knew from your own 
family™s ex perience about concentrati
on camps, was there anything about the 
American reaction to this news about the -- 
the genocide that -- that surprised you in  
any way?  
A: I don™t know that there was any American
 reaction, every individual was different. 
Some people were horrified, they were 
symp athetic. Other people didn™t believe it. 
This -- this couldn™t possibly have happened . 
And I think a lot of that is detailed  now 
in the exhibits at the museum, because th
ere was no monolithic American reaction to 

this.  
Q: Did you hear your colleagues, either at 
work or at school or wh atever, around you, 
make comment about the 
Nuremberg 
Trials? I mean, w as it general sense that this 
was a just thing to do, and was 
the sense that justice was done? 
A: I think so , yes. The more people heard 
about the atrocities of 
the Nazis, the more 
they realized there had to be
 some kind of a trial.  

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
30
Q: Did you feel justice was done in 
Nuremberg
? 
A: It has to be a case by case thing, but fo
r the most part yes,
 away with them.  
Q: Did you follow the debate in the 
U.N.
 about the partition of 
Palestine
? 
A: Yes, everybody hung on 
every word , and there were public meetings to become 
more informed on what -- and of course it 
meant more to someone who was trying to 
get into what was then 
Palestine
. 
Q: Did you ever have a
ny aspirations to go to 
Palestine [indecipherable]
 
A: Our family was studying conversational Hebr
ew ju st in case we didn™t get into the 
United States
. I have been to 
Israel
 since.  
Q: I want to ask you a little bit about your
 personal life also. How was your social life 
when you were in college a
nd -- and work ing, and all of -- you know, those -- those 
late teens, e arly 20™s, what was 
going on in your life socially? 
A: By the time I got into college, yes, I ha
d American friends. There was not too mu ch 
time for so cializing and my father was very st
rict, still v ery German. I had a very strict 
curfew, and if I didn™t appear at the time 
he decreed, I was pretty scared. And my  
friends were a little bit afraid of him as well. 
Q: Basically, wh at I want to know is how
 you met your husband an d when  that was. 
A: Well, when I took the government job at 
the Interior Department, I went on the bus 
every day to  wo rk an d always loaded down  
with books because after work I went to 
my classe s at 
George Washin gton.
 And one day a good look
ing young man offered

me his seat. What a way to meet girls. A
nd he work ed nearby and that™s how I met my  
husband. 
Q: When  was that? 
A: It was in -- let™s se
e, the winter of 1942. 
Q: And what was he doing in those days? 
A: He was -- had graduated from college the 
year before. He did it in reverse manner. 
He studi -- he studied in th
e day and worked evenings. 
And he was skilled -- he™s a 
geologist by professi
on and he was skilled in making ma
ps. They needed maps to be 
made for the air force in those days and he
 was working in  a division of the Interior 
Department that made maps especially for 
the air force, and he was work ing nearby. 
Q: Want to tell me about your 
-- your first date, real date? 
A: Well, we did go to some gathering at his 
office, but the first real date just for the 
two of us was to see the movie, 
ﬁCasablanca
ﬂ. And we have never forgotten it. This is 
-- the movie is now 60 years old and still a classic. 
Q: I want to ask you about your perspec
tive on so me things that were happening 
socially in the 
United States
. As a refugee, how did you 
view relationships in th is 
country between blacks and wh ites? 
A: Well, we thought it was totally wrong. I we
nt to a segregated high school, that was 
how everything was back then. Integra
tion did not take place until we came to 
north ern 
Virginia
. And the year that our
 children entered the 
Arlington
 county

schools is when  they  truly desegregated the 
Virginia  
schools. There were African-
American students at 
George Wa shington
, and my  husband wo rked  with so me 
African-Americans, and it was perfectly normal 
to be friends with those people. This 
was not the usual way, 
Washington
 was a southern  city at 
the time. There were some 
African-Americans w ho worked 
in the Interior Department, for the most part they 
were messengers. They didn™t get too much 
higher than  that, but nevertheless, we tried 
to be friends with them. 
Q: Was your husband born and 
raised in this country? 
A: Yes, he was born in 
New York
, lived mo st of his life -- he says he could walk to 
every school he ever attended, from el
ementary school through college, in 
Brooklyn. 
Q: During your time in this country, there 
were some very turbulent eras. And I was 
wondering if you have any thoughts a
bout the Korean war or the war in 
Vietnam
. Did 
you have any th oughts at the time or in re
trospect about some of these conflicts? 
A: My husband™s brother was in the army  du
ring the Korean war, bu
t they sent him to 
Euro pe
 instead of to 
Korea.
 Nevertheless, he dates back
 to those days. By the time 
the 
Vietnam
 war came along, our children and th
eir friends were in college and 
demonstrating ag ainst the 
Vietnam
 war. 
Q: There were many social upheavals in this
 country, the Civil Rights movement, the 
Women™s movement. Did any of 
these touch your personally? 

 
Interview with Lore Schneider  
 
August 14, 2003 
 

 
 
33
A: Well, certainly when we fi
rst were married, we lived in 
Tennessee
. Very much 
southern, very much segregat
ed. And I almost got into tr
ouble work -- I worked for a 
government agency there, for calling some
 of the African-American employees -- I 
worked in the employee relati
ons office -- for calling them 
mi ster. That is not done, 
but I insisted on doing it anyway . It took a 
long time for that kind of thing to  wear 
away. And of course now at the mu seum 
there are a number of African-American 
employees who are very close to us. I -- I 
had somebody raise their eyebro ws at seeing 
one of them kiss me. So what? 
Q: Has your level of -- of -- of -- of ma -- 
excuse me, level of ob
servance changed with 
respect to Judaism, or do you still follow th
e same traditions you 
followed as
 a child? 
A: Well, once we had ch ildren we decided it 
was time that we join
ed a congregation, 
that we sent them to Hebrew school
 and we -- when we came to northern 
Virginia
, we 
joined a congregation that we are at 
-- that we still belong to now. In 
Minnesota
 where 
we lived, we were members of a very la
rge congregation. Th
e one in northern 
Virginia
 is very small. My 
granddaughter was just 
Bat Mitzvahed 
in
 Massachusetts 
and she did everybody proud. 

Q: Well, let me ask you when you got marri
ed, and tell me a l
ittle bit about your 
children and when 
they were born. 
A: Well, the war ended in 1945. I got my de
gree in the spring of
 1946. My husband 
was discharged from the army  soon after 
the end of the war. He got a job in

Tennessee
. And in May of ™46 we were 
married and went immediately to
 Memphis
, 
and we lived there until 1950 and 
then he was transferred to 
Minneso ta
 and we lived 
there until 1960, and in 1960 he wa
s transferred again to northern 
Virginia
. We™ve 
been there ever since. 
Q: And how many children do yo
u have and how old are they? 
A: I have th ree children. They
 range in age 
from 55 to 50. 
Q: And how many grandchildren? 
A: Only  three.  
Q: What did you tell your ch ildren or your 
grandchildren about your experiences in 

your childhood? 
A: I saved some documents that I gave to
 each one of them, 
so they know why I™m 
here. The younger grandchildren 
know why grandma is in the 
United States
, but they  
have not yet visited the mu se
um. Their mo ther has been 
wanting to shield them, I 
think they™re old enough now. 
But the others know wh at grandma is about. Q: Besides 
your work at the museum, are you affiliated 
with any survivor gr
oup or organization? 
A: Not really. I was there, working for 
another volunteer group when they first 
organized, back -- oh, it mu st 
be about 20 years ago. They
 had a -- the first convention 
at the convention center in 
Washington
, it was brand new at the time. But other than 
that, just through the people 
that we have known over th
e years and the friends that 
I™ve made, fellow volunteers at th e museum.

Q: What wo rk do you do at the Ho locaust Mu seum? 
A: I work in visitor service doing the variou
s things that the people in red jackets are 
asked to do. Giving info rmation, sending th
em up into th e exhib
it, sometimes walking 
around an swering questions and 
so  on. It™s very gratifying,
 especially when visitors 
appreciate what you™ve done. In the past 
month I™ve had two letters sent to the 
museum from visitors, who -- they someho
w got my  name and wrote letters, thanking 
me for being kind to  them. 
Q: What do you think 
you personally bring to the mu se
um in the work that you do 
there? 
A: Well, of course the main thing I think th
e survivor volunteers bring is, if anyone has 
any doubts that this happene
d, we know better. A German
 lady came in not too long 
ago. She said, the more she went through th
at exhibit, the guiltier she felt because she 
was alive at that time and sh e did nothi
ng. She -- she was tha -- I think sh e was 
sincere. 
Q: Have you ever been back to 
Germany
? 
A: Yes. Not of my own volition. For many ye
ars -- for about 60 year
s, I refused to set 
foot in that place. Then, in 1995 a professor at 
der Ruhr
 University, which didn™t exist 
when  I lived there, ma naged to persuade th
e city fathers to bring back people from 
various parts of the world, those who were
 still alive, and bring them back for a 
reunion in 
Boch um
. The -- the mayor was of a differe
nt party, and previous parties

who were in charge of the city were not pa
rticularly interested, but this mayor said, 
okay, let™s do it. So they be
gan writing letters to those pe
ople that they could reach. 
One of the ways that they reache
d me is sort of interesting. 
A
, one of the people that 
stayed in 
Germany
 had a sister who lived  in ing -- in 
Israel.
 This woman was in touch 
with one of our school friends who lives in 
Ca pe To wn.
 And wh en th ey started trying 
to locate people who had formerly lived in 
Bochum
, she was telling one of her best 
friends about this. Well, this best fr
iend is my cousin, who also lives in 
Cape Town
. 
S-So through this long way ar
ound, they lo cated me and wrote a letter. And I was very 
dubious about going, I hesitate
d many months. Then  the prof
essor and his wife were -- 
and son were on a trip to the 
United States,
 and he wrote and said, we™re going to be 
in the 
Wash ington
 area. We™d like to meet you, we
™d like to go to the museum, we 
hear tickets are very hard to come by. 
Well, he asked the right person. And we 
arranged for tickets for him. And th en when  he
 called, said he™d like to meet us, I was 
still skeptical, I thought, what ki
nd of a Nazi could this be? But we decided to  take a 
chance and we met him in to
wn  for dinner. And he turn ed out to be a mo st 
extraordinary person. 
So much so that we planted a tree in 
Israel
 in his honor. He is 
absolutely, unbelievably dedica
ted. And he kind of took th e 
fear away of going, so we 
went in 1995. And th ere we met some peop
le that I hadn™t seen since we were 
children. They took us all 
around the city and showed  us
 what was left, what was 
rebuilt, what isn™t there any more. And sinc
e that time w e™ve been
 in contact with

these people. A year ago he 
and his wife came to the 
States
 and visited some of the 
former residents that they had met in past y
ears, they went to va
rious locations in the 
States.
 And next mo nth a woman who lives in northern  
Virginia
 who didn™t go on that 
first trip, although
 she had been to 
Germany
 several times, she is g o ing to go by 
herself with a friend, she is now a widow. 
She is going to go and she will get more or 
less the same program that the rest of us had back  in ™95. 
Q: How were you treated by the Germans, th
e average person, wh en you came back to 
visit? 
A: Well, these people saw to it that we were
 treated royally. He was a professor and he 
had some -- and historian -- a
nd he had some of his gradua
te students volunteering to 
escort us around. I referred 
to them as our babysitters. A
nything we wanted to do, 
anywhere we wanted to go, in
 addition to  the formal program that they had laid out for 
us. They  couldn™t have been nicer. 

Q: How was it for you to be back  in 
Germany
? Wh at was the feeling you had? 
A: It™s really indescribable. I didn™t want to
 be there and yet I did, and I said th -- the 
Shehech eyanu
 to myself. Never thought I™d be ther
e ever again, but they -- they made 
it so easy for us. And I had been  totally afra
id all those years and they -- they made it 
easy for us. 
Q: Have you ever been to 
Israel
?

A: Yes. I™ve been back twice. My husband 
worked there fo
r three months shortly after 
we came to northern 
Virginia
. At the time we couldn™t a
fford to all go. And then, 
several years later, he gave a paper at a 
U.N.
 conference, dealingw
ith the work that he 
had done before, and at that time we took 
all our ch ildren. And th en one other time we 
went to an elder hostel in 
Israel
. And at that time we me t up with  some of our old 
friends as well.  
Q: Is there anything that we haven™t me
ntioned that you woul
d like to talk about 
before we conclude the interview today? 

A: Only that I™m still finding 
out and learning things, both
 by keeping in touch with 
old friends and by work in
g at the museum. One person lead
s to another. I was j u st sent 
a clipping from the German newspaper that 
dealt with the experiences of my  school 
friend of 
Germany
 who now lives in 
Cape Town. 
In 
Cape Town
 they have just 
opened a Ho locaust Mu seum. She escort
ed me through it the day before 
Nelson 
Mandela
 was to appear for the opening. We coul
dn™t stay for that, but their focus is a 
little different, but wherever there is a mu
seum -- and there are now many of them 
throughout the world, we ha
ve gone to see what they™v
e got to teach the world. 
Q: I thank you very mu ch fo r speaking 
with us today and this concludes the 
United 
States

seum interview with
