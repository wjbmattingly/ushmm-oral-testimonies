My f am ily, m y m other,cam e to France in theearly

33.
 
 
My f ather was atrav

one who didn't leave perishedaf terthe war.  Andhisf am ily perished during the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And whatabout yourm other's fam ily?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  My m other'sf am ily, fortunatelyf or them , besides the grandparents, 
they all lef t long beforeW orldW ar II. They became French citizens at different periods. The 

grandparents did not leave.  Becauseboth
 
were under the sam e rule, under the Germ an rule, 
the PostalService was  working so we kept getting lettersf rom  them . Now I know it was 

August
 `
42. W e gotapostcard or som ethingf rom  the grandparents.  The letter said
:  W

to leave
; w

; 
we
 
don't know where.  Today we know exactl y.  T hey were m arched to 
af orest and gunned down in a pit.  Notbefore
 
--
 
af terbeing requested to take off their clothes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthetim e they wrote and said we have to leave.
 
>> A l e x 
S ch iffm a n
-
Shilo: T hey didn't know.  T hat was the lastnews we got f rom  them .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedtous that your father served in the Austrian Arm y. W hatdo 

you know about his service?
 

>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  He servedf our years, two years on the Russianf ront and two years 
in the Italianf ront.  W orldW ar I, Italy was with the allies. Thediff erence
, d
uring W orld W ar II 
Italy was with Germ any
 t
wo years. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was wounded, wasn't he?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Slightly wounded
.   N o t  ve r y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedearlier in the introductionthat your mother was a Hebrew 

teacher.  But shealso was a seam stress, wasn't she?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Shenever had theoccasion to work as aHebrew teacher. Shewas 
helping m y
 
f ather tomake a living by being aseam stress.  My sister 
r e m em be r s
 
--
 
rem em bered that she was paid by the piece. And she was sewin g zippers. And 
she was sewing, sewing, sewing all day just to be able to help m yf atherm ake a living.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hilehe's traveling around.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: W hilehe was traveling around.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parents,as youm entioned,m oved to France in 1924.  Your sister was 

born in1926and you in 1933. W hat was lif elike for yourf am ily in France? Wha
t  wa s  their lif e 

like?  Do you know m uch about it?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Idon't know, to tellyou the truth,don't know m uch about it.  I know 
that in 
`
38 wem oved to Paris,m ore central. T he norm alpath would have beenformy f ather, 
af ter af ew years of  being a traveling salesm an, to openhis own store but thisnever 

m aterialized becauseof  the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because of the war.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: W ef ledm ore or less 
to  
Paris. W hen the real war
 
--
 
when the 
PhoneyW ar was opened
 
--
 
I 
don't know if  you know that. T he beginning of W orldW arII 
off icially started September
 
1939. But the real hostilities started som ewhere in March or 
A p ri l
,  `
40. And the period inbetweenthe French called the Phoney W ar because it was awar 
without f igh
ting.  But at the end of that the Germ anoverran the French, Belgium and Holland.  

W ithinthree weeks they were in Paris
; s
om ewhere April
 
1940. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the war, as you just explainedtous, the war begins in September
 
1939 but 
re a lly ve r y lit t
le happened in Franceuntil invadedby Germ any in May of  1940.  At thattime 
you're in Paris. W hat happened whenthe Germ ans cam e intoParis?
 

>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: W e were not thereanym ore.W e were gone by then. And this sm all

thing.  At the beginning of the war, the SovietUnionm ade a pact with the f oreignm inisterand 
the Ambassador to Moscow.  He m adea pact of  non
-
aggression
 w
hich allowed, in 
` 39  
--
 
wh ic h  
allowed the Germanand the Russian to invade Polandf rom  both sides. W ithin three weeks 

P
oland was nota country, an independent country, anym ore.T hat's in history.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So when the war was no longer the PhoneyW ar, itwas the real war for you, 

your parentsandf am ily fled Paris. W hat prom pted them  to runf rom  Paris and where di
d they 
go ?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: T he Germ ans were com ing.  Many, m any people
 
--
 
not specif ically 
because we are Jews but I think the population just ranaway.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hundreds of thousandsof peoplef leeing Paris.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :   
Yeah. T hen we went to Villef ranche
-
de
-
Rouergue. My m other's 
uncle was there since
 
--
 
m any years, since the end ofW orldW ar I
;  
som ething like that.  He
 
was an uncleof m y m other, of a whole seriesof  uncles.  He cam etoFrance.  He was 15, 

b ef o r e W o r l d W
ar I. AndW orldW ar I caughthim .  He was a younger boy, 15,16, som ething 
like that.  And the war caught him  as an enem y, as anational in enem y territory.  He couldn't 

go back to where he cam efrom , to Austria, because of the war.  Sohe was assigned in
 
t he 
So
uth of France in a sm all town where he lived after. And this is where we came.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hadbeenthere sincethen.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Since then. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfatherpaidhis rent in advancef or your
 
place, your apartment, 
in  
Pa r i s  I  
think through 1943.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: T hrough August
 
1943 until som eauthorities
 
--
 
I don't know if  it was 
the Germanor the
 
French 
--
 
cam e and took whatever was in
 
--
 
they just stole it.  They just took 
it out. W hat they took with them  wasf am ily m em ories.T hef urniture didn't havem uch value 

but some pictures, you know, fam ily m em ories.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Mementos,things like 
t ha t .  Why 
did 
he  
pay rent in advance for
 
several years? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  He kept paying.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He just kept paying?
 

>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: T hisapartm entbelonged to the municipality of  Paris.  And he kept 
paying in the hope to have his own apartm ent when he comes back. 
And actually, after W orld 

W ar II he cam eback
 
--
 
we cam eback to Paris and he had a whole
 
--
 
not a trial but a whole 
judicialf ight to get hisapartm ent.  He had anotherone but he didn'twant it.  He wanted,for 

sentimental reasons,he wantedhis own.  And he got it.  Ultim ately he got it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And he had paid rentfor most of  that time. 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Paid until I think August
 `
43.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou first left Paris, you went
 
--
 
bef ore you gotto Villef ranche, you were 
in  a
 
couple of  other places.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: W e were in one little town where m yf ather's m anuf acturer lived.  My 
father was a traveling salesmanfor leather goods, bags, wallets, etc.  He hadtwo 

m anuf acturers inthat little town, Issoudun.  And we stayed therefor, I don't know, m aybehalf a 

year or som ething.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do 
you 
remember anything about your life inIssoudunfor thathalf a year? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Very va guely, vaguely, va guely.  T heonly thing I rem em ber,f rom my 
f a m il
y, two other closerelatives of m y cousins
;  
we were there. W e were, all three, in the sam e 
school. And everybody was

t im e .
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Yeah.  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfam ily lef t, as we saw on the mapearlier, to what's known as Vichy 
France. Tell us what Vichy France
 
wa s .
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Vichy France was
 
--
 
V i c h y w
as
 
--
 
b y the way, Vichy France 
--
 
people 
don't know exactly but Vichy France was under Vichy until the allies, when they cam e to 

wo r k
 
--
 
this is aroundNovem ber
 
11
,  
I think 
`
42. By reactionto the
 
Germ ans decided thatall 
France would be occupied. Because, of course, then you could com ef rom
 
--
 
I must say that 
during that period Ihad some indirect proof that France was still linked with the 
--
 
we couldn't 
eat oranges.  Oranges cam e.  T here was no
 
oranges in France. T hey cam e home. They saw 
that.  Idoubt whether they cam ef rom  Spain. I really doubt it. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the agreement whentheGerm ans occupied cam e into Franceand 

occupied Paris, they left the southern part of the stateto theVichy collaborationist governm ent.  

T hat's where you went.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Maybe they didn't have enoughmanpower.  That'salso a question. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter several m onths inIssoudun your parents thendecided to go to 

V ille f ran c h e.   Di
d they go to Villef ranchebecause that's where youruncle was?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Ithink so.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he main reason to go there?
 

>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Ithink so. W e joined another member of thefam ily who was 
we l l
-
established there,
 
we l l
-
known, even popular there.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Uncle Max?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Uncle Max.  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e a story about how Uncle Max
 
--
 
you described he was an enem y 
alien inthetown and how he m adea living
.  
I think you just
 
had a lotof  plot in the way thathe 
started carrying bags.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  He came
 
--
 
the story that he cam e to France beforeW orldW ar I, 
young m an, 15 years. He didn't have a penny in his pocket.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was 15?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  He was 15.  On theplatf orm  when he came out of the train, on the 
platf orm ,heheard Yiddish.  Som ebody was speaking Yiddish. Sohe says before to these 

people," I can carry yo ur bags if  you pay m esom ething."  And thatcouple, I think,a little 
bi t  
adopted him . A little bit. T henhefound him self alien in enem y country.  Couldn't go back.  

Couldn'tbe sent back.  So he was assignedto a town
,  
V illef ra n c he
-
de
-
Rouergue.  I guessthis 
is where he methis wif e and gotm arried.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Made
 
his life there.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Yeah.  Hemade his lif e there.  He was a butcher.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ere there otherfam ily m embers in Villef ranche?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo:  Besideshim?  No.
 
>> Bill Benson:  During your tim e in Villef ranche

and you lived theref or a considerable 
am ount of  time.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Shilo:  Morethanfour years.

that

>> Bill Benson: W hywere they not hostile?W hydid they not turnyou in to theauthorities? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Shilo:  No, the opposite is true. T he police warned m yf ather's generation 
to go into hidingfor a couple of days because they had instructions to run them out.  So just 
disappear until everything will be f ine,until you can com eback.

Anywa y, the day 
he got the license to work in France, he was already packed to go to Israel. He took the 
license and went to Israel.

the Cub Scoutsthe cam p

>> Bill Benson: T he Director?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Shilo:  T he m ath teacher. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you alsotoldus, there were times when theoff icers would come andwarn 

th
e Jewish f am ilies but they should go andhidefor a while.  You rem em ber a couple of  
incidents where you went to hide. 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Shilo: W ehad one incidence. T his isa well
-
known episode of W orld W ar 
II.  In our town there was a battalionof  SS.
  
SS was the elite troopsof the Germ an Arm y.  But 
these SS were not Germ an
;  
they were Croatian. They forced a rebellion which was crushed 
com pletely.  If  you Google the Croatian rebellion, you will f ind it. 
 
 
Now, I read abook about that recently.  T he book said that som e kids were in the 
streets looking at theGerm an playing war in  the streets. W ell, I was one of these kids.  You 

could see shootings, two or three dead bodies, covered with a blanket.  That was in the street. 

Burnt.
 
 
T he  G e rm an  pu t  a c u
rfew.  And they putposters, Germanand French, explaining the 
curfew.  Andthe last line of the curfew said
,  ﬁD
on't be inf luencedby the English and the Jews.
ﬂ
  
So we saw the Jews escaped. T his was a little bit of an adventurebut we escapedfor a week 

o
r so to a cousinof m ine.  
 
 
T he problem  was to get m yfather. W e knew his itinerary.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He's doing his work.

Shilo:  Doing his work.  And by the way, I realized m uch later m yf atherwas 
a French citizen, had a French ID

red stam p Jew.  He could have been 
arrestedanytim e. T here was no guarantee whenheboarded this train Monday morning that 

we wil l see him .

V ille f ran c
he.  Going all over France.

Shilo:  Idon't know.  Or the control on the train.  I know he lost control once 
or twice.  But they let him  go.
 
>> Bill Benson:  It's rem arkable.

Shilo: T here was no guarantee we would see 
him .  And this went on.  But 
m y f atherhad afam ily to supportand that was his job.  Hehadhis clients.  He had his

Shilo: W e knew his itinerary. W e knew that he wouldbe on this train. W e 
went to the train station justnear where we were in hiding. T he train came. It's about eight to 
10 cars. And there was no tim eto run across thetrain,no tim e.  Sothe train starts tom ove 

and suddenly we seem y fatherat the window, bending out of thewindo w.  So we ran after the 

train. W e ran after them.  They start slow enough.  Electric would have been a lost case.

Shilo:  Of course.

Shilo: T o tell you the truth, I don't rem em ber.  Ithink yes.  I think yes.

earlier, the Germ ans now had occupied Vichy France.

>> Bill Benson: W hile you were in Villef ranche, you told me a very tr agic story.  T here was a 

Polish Jewishf am ily that lived across the street.

Shilo:  I remember the nam e
, 
St

hi
.  T hey had three boys.  T hey were 
living across the streetfrom us. They were a ver y poorf am ily.  I think thefather was a tailor.  

T wo of  theboys were i n m y class.  From  what m y sister told me,m y father used to raise 

m oney am ong the little Jewish comm unity tosupport thesepeople.Oneday they 

disappeared.
 
 
People say that the father saidthey were being
 
relocated in theEast
 a
nd the father 
said, 
ﬁW
ell, at leastm y children will have something to eat.
ﬂ
  
M e an i ng
,  
how strong was the 
deceptionthat we didn't know where they wer e going. 
 

 
I must say, I tried once or twice tof ind traceshere. I couldn't do it.  I don't have the 
f irst nam esof  these boys.  I m ust maybe try harder.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they were just gone,disappeared.

1944, a Germ an armored unit passed 
through Villef ranche and started shelling buildings in your town.  Tell us aboutthat. 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Shilo: T hey cam e through.  They were underthe occupation S
ou t h of  
France. It was anelite SS arm ored division. Andpartof  it went through our town. W henthey 

saw a nice house, they took a good targeton it.
 
 
I  su spe ct

I'm not absolutely sure
. T
here was anatrocity which happenedfurther 
north in a sm all village where the Germ ans suspected there is resistancethere
.  A
nd actually 
there wasn't
b
utthey just made am istake on thenam e. T hey separatedm en, wom en,and 
children. They led the m en into barns and they shot them .T hey took the womenand the 

children inthe church.  They sealed the church. T hey threw a few gr enades andthey setthe 

church on f ire. 
 

 
Now, f or whoever doesn't believe that, the goal af ter the war decided to keep it

Not many peoplehada radio but he had one.  And after the war they broadcasted thenames 
of  the prisoners of war who were com ing back f rom prison camps,f rom  POW camps. And hi
s 
wif e was cr ying her eyes out. Andthen Iunderstood, or I understood later,that she was crying 

because allof  these prisoners were com ing back and her son didnot.

Now, I rem em beralsolistening to radio London.  RadioLondon had a signal which 
was the z in

the tim es youhad gone into the woods, I think you took refuge with a cousin or an uncle.T ell 

us about him.

of
 
--
 
he was a character.  He was a living encyclopedia.  He knew ever ything abouteveryt hing. 
 
 
On the otherhand,henever attended school.  The story about him

I learned years 
ago a story by Isaac Zinger.  He said that Jews f rom  
G le ize
 
f rom W orldW ar I were sm othering 
tobaccof rom  Austria into Poland,
 
W arsaw. W ell, m y cousin exactly s m uggled tobacco.  And I 
know that

I know the story that the poorboy, he was 13.  His siblings were

his parents 
were in the war.  He went to support thef am ily, so he sm uggled tobacco. And one day hewas 

at a train

T hey were in the French m ilitary and killed.  You hadanother cousin, if I remem ber correctly, 

was a physician, partof the French resistance as well.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Shilo: T hat's right.  My father's eldest brother's son.  He was a doctor.  He 
was a doctor. He was in the resistance.  Hewas taken prisoner by the 
German because the 

Hippocratic Oath.  Hecouldnot leave the patients.  He hada littlef ield clinic and 
he  c ou l dn ' t

who had rem ained in Poland.

1944.  The war would continue, of

1945 elsewhere.  You made it backto Paris. T ell us what it was like with the 
endof  the war to goback to Paris and resum e

Shilo:  I wentto the Jewish high school. W e hadaf am ily tradition,m y 
cousins. [Laughter]Som e cousins wentto that high school beforeW orld W arII. Another 

cousin was there, thehead counselor.  Idon't know if  you call it counselor.  Theone who was 

in charge of disciplineand all of that. W ell, that was m y cousin. And I went to that school.  I 

went to boarding school imm ediately.
 
 
W hat Ido rem em ber very vividly, to the Metro you had to go through a town, f actories 
were there on an island. The allies tried to destroy thefactory because thefactory was 

producing tanksand arm or, etc.,for the Germans. But the town was f lat. Thehouses were 

com pletely f lat.  You had to walk the
 
--
 
the street was there.  You had to walk through ruins to 
r
each the Metro. And then af ter this they rebuild it.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us how your f atherm anaged.  He continued towork to try to earn a living 

throughout the war.

t he r ,
 
he was 
not that old.  He was 
50

50,51.  Hehad torebuild hisbusiness. Iguess he was worn out, 
years of the war, being a widower.  Havin g to m ake a living under not so easy and risky 

conditions, he was quite worn out. He was worn out.  
 
 
His  
great pride was his daughter,m y sister.  My sister becam e adentist. She had 
two daughters. W ehave quite af ew picturesof m y f ather with his two granddaughters.T hat 

was his pride.  I guesshe was also proud of m e.

Shilo:  After 46,under the advance ofm y sister, I joined the Zionist youth

which is nature,f riendship, not to lieandbig m oral. I don't say that's Catholic. Moral values.  

But Zionist movem entgave you tobuild a statef orthe Jews.  This was Zionism.  Ok? 
 

 
And I remem berm yself dem onstrating in thestreets of Paris with big

not poster but 
how do you say, call that? Anywa y.  Openthe gatesof  Palestine. This was in 
`
46.  And 
`
48  
the gates were opened.  Andm any of m yf riends em igrated intoIsrael.  I stayed in schoolto be 

an agronom ist.  And then I m ovedto Israel in

>> Bill Benson:  You joined them ilitary.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Shilo:  I served in the military t wo years because I wantedtohave it behind

agronom istfor the Israeli governm ent
a
lm ostuntil I gotthe job at the United Nations. 
 
 
During that tim eI participated to the Six

Day W ar.  My contribution was

I was in 
artillery.  M y contribution was to give artillery support to the inf antry who went the Golan 

Heights, just behind shooting on Syrians.
  
 
 
I don't think the Israelis really hatedtheir enem ies. That'sm yf eeling, personal 
feeling.  Egypt was enem y
.  
Jordan was enem y.  Today we have peace with both.  Very good 
relations with
 
--
 
Syria, we hatedthem . Becausef or 19 years Syrians were up in the Golan 
Heights andthey shotalm ost every day f rom the Golan Heights on the Israeli workers in the 

f ield. T he settlem ent would have to be evacuated because they were in theopen.

Shilo:  It shouldbe the hom elandof  the Jews.  This is what it means. This 
is what it m eans.T hisis what it was createdfor.  Idon't rememberwhat the Declaration of 
Independence says
 
exactly but it's the hom elandfor the Jews. W eshould notf orget,besides 
19 years when the Jordanian were in East Jerusalem, there was a Jewish presence in theold 

city of  Jerusalem ,all the years.  At leastthis is what we say.  But it's thehom elandof  the Jews.

Shilo:  Ithinktwo things
 w
hich occurred the same day. T he day I went to 
visit at the Pentagon, Sept
ember
 
11m em orial, one day after it was inaugurated.T heday of  
the inauguration you couldn't go there because everything was off icial and only off icial. That's 

onething.  So the next day I went there.  
 
 
If you have notbeen there, you should go. 
 
F ro m
 
there you can walk to theAir Force 
m em orial which is just nearby.  If you take 395, you'll see two spikes going up.  T his istheAir 

Force memorial.  I went there. The view of W ashington isbeautiful. I'm looking at the landof  

the f ree.  And I think a
 
few days later I put in the application. 
 
 
I paid m y taxes before that.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And also, I think youalso were telling me thataround that sam e time you 
went 
to an event comm emoratingW
ood y G u t h r i e.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Shilo:  Yes, yes. T his is actually the second reason. I went to an event at 
the Kennedy Center. T he last song they sang all the audience wasstanding and singing "
T
h is  
is m y land, this is your landf rom  California toNew York I
sland,
ﬂ 
etc., e tc. "
T
his land was 
m eantfor you andm e."   And I don't know, it clicked som ething. T o see all the audience 
end 

theperf orm ance standing and singing that.  Yeah. T hat was nice.

Sh ilo :   I
 
th i
nkthe motto of them useum is " N
ever again."   The Museum  has 
two m ottos. T he big one is "
N
ev
er again."  The second one is" Rem em ber."   Rememberthe 
h o rro r.   Rem em be r.  
 
 
W hen som ebody threatens to elim inate you,better believe his intention. Ok? Bett
e r 
believe him .  Hitler could have been stopped in 
`
36 whenhe came back,for whoever knows 
history, or 
`
38. And every tim e he im posed his vie ws
 
--
 
cam e backf rom  Munich in 
`
38 and 
said I saved peace. And Churchill who was i n opposition said you have to choose between 

dishonor and war.  If  you choose 
d
ishonor, you will get war.  
 
 
So  
if  
he hadthe intention to wipe you off them ap, you betterbelieve his intentions. 
Do whatever you can to counter this intention.
