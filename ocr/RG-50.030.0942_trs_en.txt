Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoc
aust
 
Memorial
 
Museum
 interview with 
Judge 
Gui do Cal abresi
, on July 27
th
, 2017, in 
New Haven
,
 
Co nnecticut
. Thank 
you very, very much Judge
 Calabresi
, for agreeing to meet with us today, and to 
share your story, and to let us have a little window into the experi ences that you 

and your family had during those terrible and t urbulent years of Worl d War II, and 

pre- World War II. I™ll  start with the most basic questions, and the very fi rst one is, 

can you tell  me the dat e of your birth? 

Answer: I was born in October 18, 1932.  

Q: And where were you born?  
A: I was born in 
Milan
. I was born in an apart ment m y parents Œ m y father had just 
gone there to teach. We soon after moved to a house wit h m y family owned in 
Milan
, on 
Via Canova
. And such is the world Œ 
Via Canova
 is in the center, near 
the castle and so on Œ such is the world that now that house, which was our house, 

is the Turkish consulat e. 

Q: No kidding. Well that Œ that leads me to a question that usual ly would be wa y 

towards the end of the interview, but I™ll ask it now so I don™t forget. If it was your 
house, and you left it, was it that it was confiscated from you, or you so Œ your 
family sol d it?

A: No, no, we sold it after the war, it was dam aged, we sold it for al most nothing. It 
was damaged because some bombs had hit nearby. How we managed, somehow, to 

keep propert ies is Œ  is part of the story Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ that is Œ 
yeah.
 
Q: Yeah. Oka y. And then another question that seems self-evident , but it™s part of 

our format i s, can you t ell me, what was your name at birt h?  
A: My name was 
Guido Calabresi
, no Œ  
Q: As it is today. 

A: As it is today. 

Q: Oka y, no changes. 

A: No changes. 
Q: Tell me a little bit about both your mother and your father, start ing with their 
names. 

A: My mother™s name was 
Bianca Maria Finzi-Contini
, and married to
 
Calabresi
. She was born actually in 
Milan
, because her father, who was 
a 
Œ an 

early neurol ogist, he st udied with 
Charcot
, the teacher of 
Freud
. About the same 
time, he decided that much of it was bunk, he inherited some money, and kept up. 

He said, someda y i t wil l all be fine. That™s kind of nice, because hi s great-

grandchildren, one my gran Œ m y daughter, is a psychiatri st. My brot her™s son i s a 
neurologist professor at  
Johns Hopkins
. So i t™s come round. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But he was in 
Milan
 at the time. But they were from 
Bologna
. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And 
Finzi
-
Contini
 originally all came from 
Ferrara
, but the family had 
transferred to 
Bologna
 quite early and Œ and was a family that was responsible for 
much of the urban development of 
Bologna
. They owned a good deal  of the center 

of 
Bologna
. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: The kind of key figure in all this was a man named 
Leon Vita Fi nzi-Conti ni
, 

who was born in 1776, and who Œ whose grave is in the Jewish cemetery in 
Bologna
. He had many children by his first wi fe, who went in all different 
directions. Some are very actively practicing Jews in 
Israel
. One is a Œ was a 

relative in some other way, is a good friend, i s a professor of economics in Œ i n Œ in 

Turin
. And some married Catholic nobles, and became i mmensely ri ch. One of the 

great art coll ections in 
Italy
 is the 
Conti ni Bonacossi
 Collection in 
Florence
, and 
they are all descendants. They didn™t alwa ys behave well, so it Œ t he family, the y Œ 

I mean Œ

Q: In what way? 
A: The y Œ t he y had dealings with the Œ with the Nazis, and so on, and so the family 

sort of ignored them. But that was Œ he then married a second wife, and we descend 

from his second wife, and Œ and Œ but part  of that is the reason why the name 

Finzi-Contini
 is one that gets used. 
Q: Well, that was Œ I mean, of course, that™s one of the questions that I was going 
to ask later, but I™ll ask it now, is Œ is of course the movie, that was ever Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ you know, so very popular, ﬁ
The Garden of the Finzi
-
Continis
.ﬂ
 
A: So let me first sa y something about m y fat her. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Well, one other thing about m y mother™s family. Her mother is of a family that 
clai ms to have been brought by 
Titus
 in his triumph, in 70 
Common Era. 
Caesar 
Roff
(ph) sa ys it™s so. The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1900 sa ys it™s so. There were Œ  
when the Romans conquered a place, the y tended to bring princes, kings and so on 

in their trials. When the conquered 
Palesti ne
, the y brought judges, priests and 
elders. We were the elders. 
Zekanym
(ph). 
Q: I™ll tell you, I have Œ I™m sorry to interrupt . I have never met som ebody who 

could trace his family back Œ

A: Well 
Œ 
Q: Œ more t han 200 years. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Never mind 2,000. 

A: Well, so they came as, in the tribe Œ I Œ I must sa y, I haven™t seen anybody Œ I 
went to the Arch of 
Titus
, nobody looks l
ike my great
-uncle, carryi ng the menorah, 
but there it is. Anyway, they came as Œ as slaves, originally, became t utors to the 

emperors. Followed the emperors to 
Ravenna
 when the western empire went there, 

and when the empire fell, around 500, moved nearby, to a town of 
Lug o
, where 
they set up shop as bankers, mone yl enders, and as rabbis of the Italian rite
. Because 

we are 
Italki m; we are not Sephardic, we are not Ashkenazi m, we are people who 

were there before the diaspora, and in 
Italy
, and in 
Israel Œ
 the
re™sa synagogue in 
Israel
 which is the Italian one. Obvious rite. And that was what our tradition was 

on both si des. And so t hese people, who had all sorts of ups and downs, ultimately 

lent enough money to t he pope so that he gave them permission to practice their 

trade in 
Bologna
. And Ithink the popes meant by trade,banking, money
- lending. 
These people said, but we are teachers of law, because the y were rabbis of the 

Italian rite. And so, I don™t know if it™s true, but somehow Œ but the Œ  the legend is 

that the wa y we got  into law teaching was because of this. Anywa y, so Œ

Q: How did you learn of this? 
A: Oh, thi s is all family tales and st ories that ha Œ have been, and I j ust enjoy them. 

Well, anywa y, that line is one whi ch was very self-important, for obvi ous reasons.  
Q: Yeah. 

A:And m y grandmother married my grandfather,this 
Œ of this very good family, 
with high i ntellect ual traditions, and so on, and going back hundreds of years in 

itself, in 
Ferrara
. But t hat gave that name a certain connot ation, of elegance, or 
something. My Œ I 
saidto my mother 
Œ m y mother said ari stocracy, I said 
decadence, she said i t™s the same thing, 
G uido
. And there it is. Okay. Now. 
Q: A child would sa y t hat to his mother. 

A: Let me t hen take m y father™s family, and Œ because that  deals with this book. 

My father™s family, the 
Calabresi
, were, according to their traditi on, which isn™t as 
proven as the other, were traders in 
Rome
 i n Republican ti me. That i s even earlier. 
Now, it is a fact that the largest number of people in 
Rome
 
who were notRomans, 

at the time of the Roman Republic, before 
Juli us Caesar
, before the empire and so 
on, were Jews, who were traders. There were about 15 Œ 2500. Different figures, 

but a significant number of people who were Jews trading. And t he story, in that 

side of the family is that the y sta yed there, and when Œ and settled somewhere 

south of 
Rome
, where we don™t know. In 1496, everything from 
Rome
 
south was 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

Spanish territory, and Jews were expelled in 1492 from 
Spa in
, 1496 fromSpanish 
territory, 
Portugal
 and Spanish territory. Two people went  from somewhere south 
of 
Rome
, to 
Ferrara
. And there i s a document which sa ys two people came from 
Le Calabria
. Toda y 
Calabria
 is just the toe. But in 
Ferrara
, at the t ime, the y 
called everything from 
Rome
 sout h, 
Le Calabria
. And said where two people 
came, bought lands Œ 
because 
Ferrara
 was very open to Jews. I™ll show you some 

pictures 
[indecipherable]
. And because they came from 
Le Calabria
 and there 
were two of them, we called them 
Calabrese
, which means p
eopl e from 
Calabria
.
 
Calabrese
 with an 
e
, meaning person, is quit e a common name in the south. 
Calabresi
 with an 
i 
is unusual. It isn™t al wa ys just descendants of these two, but  a 

lot are descendants of these two, and with an 
i
, it often is Jewish. With and 
e
 Œ not 
always, but  often is Œ with an 
e
, almost never. 
Q: Never. 
A: We 
Œ the other line had many children, and so on. We were down to none, until 
m y father was born. He was the only male of his generation. So m y grandfather 

tried to see if these two were related. Then m y father was born, and he lost interest. 

Anywa y, t he y came to 
Ferrara
, joi ned the Ital ian synagogue. There were in 
Ferrara
 a German, a Spanish, and an Italian, and the y joined the Italian. But it 
wasn™t because they were angry wi th the Spanish. If you look at the ruins of the 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017

Spanish synagogue, you see signs of donations by 
Calabresi
 because the y treated 
us so well, when we were in their t erritory. So it Œ the y were Italki m, who had to be 

Sephardic when thi s was Spanish territory, got to 
Fe
rrara
, found an Italian 
synagogue and joi ned up in it, which gives some evidence that maybe the story t hat 

they went back, is t rue. They married into another very, very old and very wealthy 
family of 
Ferrara
, 
Minerbi
, who are also Œ again, the family is all over. One of 
them, 
Sergio Minerbi
 is in 
Israel
 and was the ambassador of 
Israel
 t o the unite Œ 
to 
Euro pe
, and Œ and at one point  to the Vatican, which he didn™t  much like. But he 
Œ anyway, this family i s a major, major family, and had Œ and members of th
e 
family still do Œ had houses Œ and I™ll show you on the map of 
Ferrara
 afterwards, 

where Œ which go back to the 13
th
 century. My father™s first cousin and best friend, 
was the patron of 
Bassani
, the man who wrot e the book 
fromwhich the movie was 
taken. He helped hi m financially, and 
Bassani
 wrote the book, that book and 
others. He dedicated one to m y cousin, but he wrote that book and ot hers in that 

family house, in the library of that house. And he Œ 

Q: 
Minerbi
? In the 
Mi nerbi
 fami ly house? 
A: In the 
Mi
nerbi
 famil y house. And he t old m y father™s cousin in t he courtyards 
of this house, I™m writi ng a book, and I™m goi ng to call it, ﬁ
The Garden of the

Contini
.ﬂ Why did he pick m y mother™s name Œ  

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

11
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ in my father™s family
™s
 house? Nobody knows this, but I do. 
Q: Tell me. 

A: And the story, I™m sure, is this. His patron™s younger sister, m y m other™s Œ 
m y 
father™s first cousin Œ 
Q: And his father™s first cousin™s name was? 
A: 
Giuseppe Mi nerbi
, 
Beppe Minerbi
. And as I sa y, he dedicated another boo k, 
ﬁ
The Heron
,ﬂ to hi m, and there are any number of things about i t. 
Beppe
 had a 
younger si ster, who married m y mother™s brot her. The y met at our Œ 
m y parents™ 
wedding, married. So that it was not surprising that he would think, i n this guy™s 

house, of a younger Œ near his age, not his age, person named 
Finzi-Contini
. And 

then, the fact that 
Finzi
-
Contini
 connoted all sorts of things, pleased hi m. Now Œ  
Q: Did he have to get permission? 

A: Œ the st ory Œ well, t here™s the Œ the story is Œ bu Œ the story i n t
he movieand so 

on, isn™t about us. I can tell you al most everything that happened, whom it 

happened to. And some happened t o one, some happened t o another, and Œ and so 

on. But it wasn™t our st ory, with one possible, interesting exception. But certainly 

not the 
Finzi
-
Contini
. Did he have to get permi ssion? We thought t hat he had not, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017

and m y mother was kind of annoyed at that . In the papers of m y double cousin, t hat 
is this son of my mother™s brother and m y father™s cousin Œ  
Q: 
Minerbi
 Œ 
A: Œ who died a couple of years ago. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And who was my age, and very close. We found a letter that he had not 
particularly seen, because he Œ he never talked about Œ and he would have, we™ve 

talked about the thing, to his father, m y uncle. 

Q: From 
Barani
(ph)? 
A: Fro
m 
Bassani
. 
Q: 
Bassani
, excuse me. 

A: Saying, I™m writing a book, and I want to call it ﬁ
The Garden of the Finzi
-
Contini
.ﬂ I thought of you because of that. So that I am quite sure of the story Œ 
nobody knows this, but  it™s so Œ and I™m Œ that he sort of asked for permi ssion. And 

that™s how that came to. 

Q: Did your mother fa Œ did you find tha Œ were you able t o tell your mother this?  

A:No, m y motherwas longsince dead.
 
Q: It went pa Œ okay. 

A: I just learned thi s two years ago, when m y cousin died. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017

Q: Ok
a y.
 
A: My mother made peace with 
Bassani
. It was an intere Œ that™s another story, 
that is really to deci de, but Œ 

Q: Well, let ™s come Œ I mean, I do want to discuss the Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ ﬁ
The Garden of the Finzi
-
Continis
,ﬂ as a movie, as a work of art, as 
something that is Œ 

A: And as Œ also as Œ 
yeah
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Because where it Œ t here are interesting questions about that. 
Bassani
 himself 
didn™t like the movie for certain reasons.  

Q: Oh, did he? Oka y. 
A: No. He pulled himself away, and then it ™s a reason, all which have to do with 
the treatment of Jews during that t i me, and so on. So Œ 

Q: So let™s Œ I™d li ke to talk about that, but  let™s leave that for later, so that we make 

a distinction between what is truly your famil y
™s story 
Œ  
A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: Œ 
an
d then Œ 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
14
 
Q: Œ you know, the Œ the taking of that st ory Œ 
A: Yeah, it Œ 

Q: Œ and someti mes twisting or changing.  

A: That™s ri ght. Yeah. 

Q: I am Œ I must say, I am awed to learn of such a history, that goes back so many 
centuries, and that it  would be known. I mean, there are many things that come to 
m y mind as you™re telli ng. Number one, that there would be enough factual 

knowledge to be able t o support some of the stories that you hear. 

A: Yes. 

Q: I mean, t hat is unusual in itself 

A: Yes. 

Q: And nu mber two, that there is no assimilation. And yet Œ 
A: No, there™s no Œ 
Q: No assimilation. We have two millennia. 

A: Well, that is interest ing too, because at Œ at any number of times, i n the history 

of this 
Zeka nym
(ph),
 Delvecchio
(ph), 
DeLugo
(ph) fami ly, you have first names 
that sound Catholi c. And at other t i mes you have names that are nondescript, li ke 

Alexander
, 
Cyrus
, names that Jews who were assimilati ng had. And at other times 
you have names which are clearly Jewish, 
Ekako h
(ph), 
So lomone
(ph), 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
15
 
Abramo
(ph), and so on. So that I think Œ and I think it is clearly t he case, that at 
many ti mes, in the hist ory of these families, some married Cathol ics, some 
assimilated, some came back. At ti mes it was done because it was useful. At times 

it was done because people did. But then, there alwa ys was a pull back. And that ™s 

kind of interesting, because no Œ 
m y 
Œ it™s another story, but m y mother became 
Catholic, and I was brought up Catholic. My wife is an old Yankee. My daught er, 

Bianca Fi nzi
-
Contini
 reconverted.  
Q: To Judaism? 

A: What?
 
Q: To Judaism? 

A: Yeah. And her daughter, 
Ginevra
(ph)
 Finzi
-
Contini Gil more 
is going to 
have 
her Bat Mitzvah this comi ng June. So Œ and the same is true of some branches in 
Italy
. It™s just a very complicated tale. 
Q: It is. It i s, and it is very different from Œ from both the history of Jews in other 
countries, and their lives Œ 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Œ in these other countries, and t heir identiti es in these other countries. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Because as a Œ  

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
16
 
A: Which has something to do with what happened to us when we came here, but  
that™s another Œ 
yeah .
 
Q: Yeah, we™ll Œ we™ll Œ we™ll come there. So, tell me a Œ are we at noonti me yet? 

A: We™re fine, no. 

Q: Oka y, we have a bit  of time. 
A: The y™re going t o tel l us. 
Q: Oka y. So tell me a l ittle bit about this, about Œ well, let™s start  wit h some factual 

things. Your mother, di d she have siblings? 

A: She had three si blings. She was the eldest. 

Q: Oka y, 
Bianca
. 
A: Then her Œ the second, 
Bruna
(ph) 
Fi nzi
-
Contini
 was the one who married the 
Minerbi
. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The third, 
Marcella
(ph), marrieda man named 
Guido Tedeschi
, who was of a 
very, very wealthy old, very Jewish family of 
Bologna
. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And their story, they ended up going t o 
Brazil
, and their story is another 

interesting story, whyt hey w
ent to 
Brazil
, and it™s part of our story of coming. And 

then a younger brother, 
Renato
(ph), who married a woman of a Sephardic family, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
17
 
but who also was in some other wa y a cousin, because there were many inter-
cousins marriage. And their son is still al ive, and lives in 
Milan
, and i s a very close 
friend. 

Q: Oka y, so to it Œ so t here was bianc Œ 
yeah .
 
A: And m y father™s family, instead, were free. My father was the youngest, he had 
an older sister
 Renata
, who was one of the founders of clinical psychology. 
Sh e 
fled to 
America 
Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ too. Then 
Cecilia
(ph), who Œ neither were married. She stayed in 
Italy
, and 
looked after m y grandmother, and did some quite courageous and remarkable 

things duri ng the war. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And after the war, she came and joined us, but both are buried in the Jewish 
cemetery in 
Ferrara
. 
Q: And your father™s name is? 

A: 
Massimo
. 

Q: 
Massimo
. So, he was the youngest of three. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And he had two elder sisters. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
18
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Oka y. And your mother ha Œ was the ol dest  of four. 

A: Four. 

Q: And how Œ 

A: She had two younger brothers and one younger sister. 
Q: Sister, oka y. Why is it that your mother eit h Œ was it herself, or her parents who 
converted to Cathol icism?  

A: She converted. That™s actually a very int eresting story. She convert ed, and m y 

father, who did not, and who is interesting, because I don™t think practically ever 

set foot in a synagogue. He was a not a beli ever in any wa y, though he wanted, and 

we™ll talk about that , to be buried in the Jewish cemetery i n 
Ferrara
, and he Œ it™s a 
complicated business. But he would, I think, have been extremely upset if m y 
mother had done what many, many people in her family, and in all sorts of other 
families di d, was t o convert because of the racial laws. Because he would have 

thought Œ he thought that was cowardly. Or, done for financial reasons, which i t 

was done. I™m not one t o judge; many people did that, and so on. My mother 

converted, I™m quite sure, for a very odd reason. She was a highly int ellectual 

woman, 
PhD
 in 
Italy
, 
PhD
 here. In some ways, a femini st. And not in a modern 
way, but a woman who Œ and at some poi nt, she decided she believed in God. And 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017

the problem was that al l these ancient Italian Jewish families, pret ty much all of 
them, were non-pract icing, non-
believers. I 
mean, you know, we were Jewish 

because that was the great tradition. It was almost a snobbery. It was something we 

were very, very keen on, and are still very, very keen on. But it was not a religious 

mat ter, at all . But peopl e in 
Italy
 who were rel igious, were all Orthodox. Now, for 
a woman who thought herself liberated, to be Orthodox at that ti me Œ we™re talking 

1920s and so on, 30s, that didn™t fit. And so Œ 

Q: She didn™t have choices. 

A: Œ it™s a little ironical  today. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: She became Catholi c because thi s was a way to practice, because she didn™t feel 

you could just be religi ous, and not.  
Q: And not associated with somet hing.  
A: That™s ri ght. And Œ and m y father respected that in a wa y that he would not have 

respected Œ he didn™t li ke it. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But he respected it. And the interesting thi ng about her, as she became older and 

older, she said, as I get older, I become ever m ore Catholi c, and ever more Jewish.

A: Œ townhouse that Œ and we had a great deal  of help. I Œ m y brother and I never

had a wonderful nanny, who came back to l ook after m y children when we went on

sabbatical for the first time. And we lived what seemed to be a very ordinary life. 
Underneath, there was a tremendous struggle, because my father, from the earliest 

days of fascism, had been an active anti-fascist . He was first beaten and jailed in 

1924, when he was a student in
 
Fl orence
.  
Q: Studying what? 
A: The y were in 
Florence 
because my grandparentshad mo
ved from 
Ferrara 
to 
Florence
. The y had moved from 
Ferrara 
to 
Florence
 
because my grandfather 
Calabresi
, who was an industriali st, was a very powerful man. Hi s wife, 
Minerbi
, 
was a Œ probably the wealthiest family in 
Ferrara
, certainly the wealthiest Jewish 
family in 
Ferrara
, of great landowners. The y owned huge amounts of land. To the 
fascists, in a small town like 
Ferrara
, havi ng this pair, who were fiercel y anti-
fascist, was too dangerous. And so the y said, out of here. You can go anywhere in 
Italy
 
you wa
nt, but not in 
Ferrara
. And if you come back to 
Ferrara
, we™ll jail  
you.So m y par 
Œ grandparents, moved to 
Florence
. And t here is, m y oral historian 
found a letter from the fascist prefect in 
Ferrara
, to the fascist prefect in 
Florence
, 
you™ve gott en your
self a real headache, because 
Ettare
(ph) 
Calabresi
 Œ 
m y 
grandfather™s name Œ li kes to talk, causes t rouble, has re Œ millions to support his 
trouble, and he is going to cause you Œ m y grandfather went awa y. My father 
became actively anti
-fascist, and part of a small group of democrat s with a small 
d
, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

who were anti-fascist. The y didn™t  belong to any ism. He helped distribute the first 
underground newspaper, 
no n m
ollare
, don™t give up. Was called j usti ce and 
liberty, ﬁ
Giustizia e libertà
.ﬂ And on his grave it sa ys, in Italian, fait hful to justice 

and liberty, which i s a pun, both Œ he was, as I say, va Œ was very, very active. 

When it c-
came clear t hat 
Mussolini
 wouldn™t fall, that the y couldn™t  bring him 
down, in t he late 20s, earl y 30s, m y father wanted to l
eave.
 
Q: 
Italy
?  
A: Yeah. My grandfather was a patriot of the old school, and said, one doesn™t 
leave one™s country, one sta ys and fights. And so we sta yed. In the fall of 1937, my 

grandfather died of natural causes. That same summer, slightly before, the two 

brothers who had become heads of this small group of anti-fascists Œ they were 

named 
Rosselli
, and everywhere in 
Italy
 you™l l find a square or a boulevard named 
Fratelli Ro sselli
, 
Roselli
 brothers, were murdered by the fascists. So m y f Œ and 
they were m y father™s closest friends. And m y aunt, the one who came, were just 

very close friends. So my father said, it™s gett ing too close, and with his father 

dying, he didn™t feel an obligation to sta y. So in 1937, before the raci al laws, m y 

father decided that we would leave. But t hat was not easy, because you couldn™t 

leave.
 
Q: Let™s get  to that in a mi nute. You sa y he was beaten up in the early 20s. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

A: Yes. 
Q: Do you know t he circumstances of that? 

A: Oh, I know the circumstances very wel l. I™ve told it in some commencement 

talks. One of my commencement tal ks at 
Connecticut
 C ollege, many years ago, is 

listed in the best Œ 10 best commencement t alks, as publi shed somewhere, because 
it was choices. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And one of the stories is how m y father chose to bec
ome an act ive anti
-fascist. 
And I asked hi m, and he said, everybody talks about the banality of evil, no one 

talks about the banality of good, and it is equall y Œ well, here™s how it  happened. I 

was a student at the University of 
Florence
, because we had moved t o 
Florence
, 
and the fascists had kicked out the president of the university because he was very 
strong and tough, and Œ  
Q: And you™re talki ng now in your father™s voice. 

A: Yes. 

Q: 
Massimo
 is sa yi ng I was in a Œ 

A: Yeah, that™s right. This is 1924 Œ ™23, ™24, something like that, ™24. And he Œ 

they kicked out the president, and my father said Œ and they put i n hi s place, one of 

our teachers, professor, I don™t know, of anatom y of physiology or somet hing. Was 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
29
 
a nice man, we liked. And wasn™t particul arly fascist, but was weak. So but Œ ah, he 
was installed, and he was our teacher, so we went to the i nstallati on. And he gave a 

speech, and fine, and we applauded. And t hen the fascist minister of education got 

up, and gave a horri ble speech. Well, hi m j ust sayi ng, you™ll do t his, you™ll do that, 

you™ll do t he other, just  horrible. You can imagine. And he stopped i n the middle, 
as politicians will do for applause, and m y father said, I di dn™t applaud. And sai d 
some 
Œ couple of us didn™t applaud. We di dn™t hi
ssorboo. We were muchtoo well 

brought up to do anything like that . But we just didn™t applaud. Then somebody 

behind me said, the next ti me he stops, you™d better applaud, because there are 

some goons at the back who are taking the names of those who are not applauding. 

My father said, I was 21 years old. If somebody had told me that if I went and 

didn™t applaud I™d get i nto trouble, I probably would have sta yed home. Or I mi ght 
even have gone and applauded. But here I didn™t applaud, and now somebody told 
me I had to applaud. I couldn™t do it. So I didn™t applaud the next  ti me, and when 

we left, we got picked up and beaten up. And I said, what  happened t hen? He said, 

we went to wash. And I said, why? He sai d, we didn™t want to go home, people 

lived at h
om
e, and t he y 
[indecipherable]
 
the university,
 and show ourselves 
bloody, to scare our Œ our parents would have been frightened. And I said, where 

did you wash? Well, there was a fountain right  there, and so we washed there. And 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
30
 
so I said, did you wash there to show you had been beaten up? And he said, I don™t 
think so, no. He became a little bit Œ but we washed there, and the fascists thought 

that we did, and so they picked us up agai n and beat us up again and t ossed us i nto 

jail. And so, at that  point, I wa
s an act
ive anti-fascist. I mean, that was it. And he 

then did ot her things. On the anni versary, he and m y aunts Œ and thi s been written 
up recently Œ on the anniversary of the murder of the leader of the ant i-fascists, 
Matteotti
, on the first anniversary they went to put a big crown of flowers at 

Garibaldi™s
 memori Œ thing, and the fascists picked them up again and tossed them 
in jail, and that™s how t hat happened. 

Q: So in some wa ys they made hi m an anti-fascist. 
A: Yes 

Q: He had the incli nati on Œ 
A: He said Œ you know, there were many people who were anti-fascist, but the 
difference was between those who became acti vely, and that became t hat. Now, 

you know, again, in terms of choices and non-choices, which is what I say in that , 

fast-forward to 1963, and the march on 
Washington 
Œ 

Q: Oh yeah. 

A: Œ with 
Martin Luther King
. I had been planning to go, and then I got 
frightened, because now everybody thinks of it as a Sunda y school picnic, but at 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
31
 
the ti me there were bombings in 
Alabama
, congress fled town, ever
ybody was 
scared. And I had a one year old chi ld, 
Bianca
, 
Jonathan™s 
wife, and I thought 
gee, you know, the march will take place, it doesn™t really need me. And so Œ 

during the week before the march, I™m talki ng to my father on the phone, and he 

said, oh, I™m going to 
Washington 
thi s weekend. And I said, why? And he sai d, 
I™m going to the march. And I Œ I thought of him as being very ol d, he was maybe 

20 years younger than I am now, but you know how kids are, and I sai d, but it ma y 

be dangerous. And he said, I™m goi ng. I said, well, then I™ll go with you. And he 

said, I thought you would. And of course, we went together, and i t was a 

tremendous experience for me, to be there as part of that wonderful event. Not so 

much the speeches now one talks of, but just walking with thousands of people, 

holding hands, and so on. And it made a big difference to me, and I know that my 
father was creating a non-choice for me, as he had done. 
Q: Wow. I am it Œ wonderful tok Œ topic for young college students, graduates, 

because Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ it™s the same age t hat the y are. 

A: Yeah.

Q: You know? It is, in essence a small step, and what that small step of non-
applauding Œ 

A: That™s ri ght, that™s right. 

Q: Œ 
truly meant.
 

A: It just Œ  it coul d be a Œ a small step which t hen leads, and if you then are true to 
yourself. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So Œ so as I say, we were living in 
Milan
 well, but there was this, and we were 
tryi ng to get out. And the story is Œ and I don™t know it, you know, this is more 
hearsa y, that  what happened was that it was ill egal to leave 
Italy
 permanently. 
Fascist, you know, dict atorial countries don™t want people to leave. But you coul d 

get out if you had a fellowship for a year, you know, or a term, or somet hing of that 
sort. And that a man in 
Turin

something, but much ol der than m y father, named gins Œ

with the head of the

to come for a fellowship. 

Q: Now we hadn't asked you yet, what was your fa Œ when you were born, what 

was your father doi ng? What was his profession? 

A: My father was a Œ was a cardiologist. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And he had studied in mila Œ in 
Florence
, and then had moved to 
Milan
, where 
the head of card Œ 
of medicinewas a mannamed 
Cesa-
Bi a nchi
, who wasactual
ly 
very Cathol ic, very friend of the Pope 
Pius
 the 11
th
, and very anti-fascist, and had 
gathered a group of people around him, who were anti-fascist. And m y father was 

his right hand, and Œ and Œ and Œ an associate professor of cardiology there. The 

story of the pope is that the pope died the day before he would have i ssued an 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

34
 
enc yclical Œ there™s a book about t hat Œ an encycli cal, wit h burning sorrow, 
excommunicating 
Mussolini
, and declaring that 
Hitler
 was a pagan, because of the 
racial laws. And he died the night before. 

Q: Is that enc yclical sti ll written, available? 

A: It was t h Œ it never got out.  
Q: No. 
A: Probably 
Oliver La Farge
 here, had somet hing Œ 
a 
Œ a great deal t o do with i t. 
He was a man who did much interracial things. The new pope, of course, was 
Pius
 
the 12
th
, and he wou Œ issued an encyclical under the same name, that did nothing. 
My fa
ther Œ actually, it was called Œ the pope was from 
Milan
 and was friends with 
this guy in 
Milan
. And months before he died, he didn™t trust his Roman doctors, 
and he had m y father, actually go Œ he wanted this guy, who was m y father™s chief, 
who was his friend, but he had heart  trouble, and so m y father was the one who 
went down. The ﬁ
New York Times
ﬂ reported, a week or two later, that he had 

been seen by this great it Œ Milanese cardiologist, and then gave the name of my 

father™s chief, because in the interim, the racial laws had been passed, and so m y 

father became a non-being. 

Q: Oh m y. 

A: But it was m y father who saw hi m.

Q: You Œ your mother was also involved in fa Œ anti-fascist activit ies, is that so? 

A: My mother was Œ she was very much with m y father Œ

I want to ki nd of turn t he story to a very personal perspecti ve, and that is you as a 
little boy. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And growing up in 
Milan
, what some of your earliest memories are, and I™ll ask 
more questi ons from there. 
A: Yeah. So, m y memories of growing up in 
Milan
 are memories of a quiet 
childhood, going to school there, going on vacation Œ 
Q: Public school? 

A: Œ often. Vacation was a kind of compli cated thing for families like ours. In June, 

one Œ I™m sorry, in July, one went t o the seashore for a month. In August one went 

to the mountains, and in September, one went to, in this case m y mot her™s parent s™ 

villa outside 
Bologna
. And the father of the family woul d join you for a m Œ on 
weekends, and the month that he t ook vacat ion. And my father, being a mountain 
climber, would joi n us in August, when we usually woul d go in the 
Dolomites
, 
someti mes in 
Va-Val d™Aoste
, but usually the 
Dolomites
, and almost alwa ys, the 
whole family would manage to go, cousins, aunts, uncles, to the same place. I 

mean, arranging where you went, you would rent houses in someplace on the shore, 

and everybody would go there. And one year you™d be in t he 
Adriatic
, another the 
Mediterranean
, and that would be that. And I have many, many memories of these 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

37
 
times, bot h in the mountains, and photographs of us in the mountains, and in the 
seashore, and all of those things with m y cousi ns. And we were all  very cal m, 

because my parents, thoughactivelyanti
-fasci st, did not make a point  of saying t his 

to us, especially because my father was determ ined to leave, and he thought there 

will be ti me enough to talk about t hose thi ngs, but anything of that sort that was 
told to us, might make it, in fact, even more di fficult. So we grew up, and were at 
school, public school, because in 
Italy
 everybody went to public school, unless you 
were either very stupid, or totally bigoted, but you just didn™t go to any other kind 

of school. There was an event which sa ys something about the underlyi ng life. 

Someti me during m y fi rst grade, which would be 1938, I guess, there was a large 

funeral of some fascist bigwig. And the fascists wanted everybody, all the children 

in schools, to march in the funeral parade, in uniform, because we were all 
supposed to march in uniform, and do all t hings in uniform, and things. And m y 
older brother, who was in third grade, at an age where the y already marched with 

rifles, with guns. 

Q: Really? And eight and nine year old boys?  

A: Yes, yes, which may sa y something about my attitude about guns. And said, 

we™re not gonna march. This is ri diculous, chil dren with guns shouldn™t march, this 

is all so Œ where he got that, I do not know. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

Q: He told his teachers? 
A: He told me that we were not going to march. I said fine, because he was m y 

older brother, I alwa ys did what he wanted. And I said, how are we gonna get out 

of it? He said, we™re going to sa y t hat our uniforms are bei ng washed, and we can™t 

afford to have two sets. Of course, it was ri diculous, but we didn™t know that. And 
we insisted, and we did not march. With the result that I got that term, the only 
failing grade I have ever gotten. It was, I failed fascist behavior, 
comportomento 

fascista
, and it™s ri ght t here on my report card, for Œ 

Q: I mean, if there™s a badge of honor, there it  is. 

A: Yeah, there it is. So, this is by way of sa ying that there was thi s funny, 

underlying kind of a thi ng of Œ 
thatwe may haveknown more,or atleast m y 

brother, who was just eight, nine Œ he was two and a half years older than Œ than I, 
eight at that ti me. We Œ that we kind of were there, and you know. Now, you asked 
in ab Œ ab Œ  we were talking about 
Ferrara
, and the house there Œ  
Q: Yes, I wanted to find about 
Ferrara
 and Œ 
yeah.
 
A: I have no recollection of going to that house. 

Q: The house that belonged to your Œ 

A: To m y father™s first cousin. At that ti me, it belonged to his uncle Œ 

Q: Right.

A: Œ m y grandmother™s brother. And I was thinking about that, because I remember 
very well being at m y mother™s parents™ villa outside of 
Bologna
. I remember very 

well 
Florence
, where we would always go in the spring for 
Pa squa
.  
Q: Passover? 

A: Easter. 
Pesach
. I don™t know, I mean, we didn™t celebrate either, and m y 
grandparent s didn™t cel ebrate either, but it was that ti me of year, and i t™s interesti ng 
that the word for Easter in Italian i s 
Pasqua
, which is both 
Pesach
 and Easter, and 

that we would always go, wherein 
Florence
 was in flower by then, while 
Milan
 
was likely to be foggy, so it Œ m y memories of going to m y grandparents in 

Florence
, and the y had a wonderful garden, and the gardeners were marvelous 

people and played with us and so on and so forth. These are wonderful memories of 

that Œ the house, as storied during t he war, how it survived and didn™t and so on. 
All of that. But I have no memory of going to the house in 
Ferrara
, or to seeing 
that. And I was thinking about that just now, and the answer is quite obvious. My 
grandparent s were prohibited from going t here by the fascists. So, of course I 

didn™t go, t he y didn™t go back to 
Ferrara
. 

Q: Because they had been kicked out. 

A: And Œ because t he y had been kicked out . And so, of course, we di dn™t either. 

Now ma ybe my father went to see his cousin and so on, but thi s was not a place,

even though it was this family site on m y father™s family Œ 
m y mother™sfamily was 
in 
Bologna
 Œ but we didn™t go there, I™m quite sure, because m y father Œ 
m y 
grandfather couldn™t go there. And I know that once he went, because there was a 
funeral of a friend, and he thought he snuck in, and they arrested hi m. H
e 
Œ we 

were rich enough so that none of t
hat mattered.
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I mean, you could al ways buy your wa y out , and that, but I think the answer 

about why I didn™t reall y focus on 
Ferrara
 unt il after the war is because Œ 
Q: Cause of that. 

A: Œ m y branch had been exiled from there. 
Q: But there was other branches of the fami ly that could sta y Œ 

A: Of course, because t hey Œ  
Q: The y weren™t as wealthy. 

A: The y were wealthy, the y were there, and they were, of course, mil dly anti-

fascist, or anti-fascist, but the y were not in trouble in the way my fat her 
and my 

grandfather were. The story is told that t his cousin, who came to own these lands, 

was a cousin who Œ in whose house, when the garden was written, the son of the 

then proprietor, but  who was already Œ he had studied agri culture because he was

hm.
 
A: The story is tol d Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ 
by m y 
Œ my father told me, that in the 1930s, he was a Œ there was a prize 
given by the fascists for the greatest  increase i n, I think i t was wheat production. 

He had studied agricult ure and wanted to put in modern methods and so on, and 

was able to convince his farmers to go along with doing these. The y wanted to do 

things in traditional ways, and he wanted t o do that, by promising them t hat if the y 

won the pri ze, he would give it to them. They won the pri ze, and at that point the 
fascists said, you are to give the prize to the fascist party as a sign of solidarity. He 
had alwa ys been, you know, philosophically anti-fascist, but hadn't done Œ he had 
alwa ys argued with m y father, my father shoul dn™t have gotten int o trouble. He, 

stubborn, but is Œ look, I promised the prize to m y farmers, I™m gi ving the prize t o 

m y farmers. I™m perfectly happy t o give you some money, but the pri ze Œ 

Q: Goes to the farmers. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
42
 
A: Œ goes to the farmers. The fascists said, no the prize you have to gi ve to the 
fascist part y, as a symbol of that. At that point he refused, and at that point the y 

beat hi m up. He didn™t Œ you know, that was just an isolated Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ incident, but i t shows both Œ how most people were ki nd of going along, even 
if they were anti-fascist in a mild wa y. And so that™s what the people who were i n 
Ferrara 
did. The y were not Œ they were anti-fascist, but the y weren™t  going to get 

into troubl e. On the other hand, at that point, he got into t rouble. Not permanent 

trouble, but because of that. 

Q: But also on a point, you know, at the point where your father had said, I am not 

going to applaud, your uncl
e 
Œ he would have been your great-uncle, 
Pepe
(ph)?  
A: 
Beppe
 was his cousin. 
Q: Was his cousin, so he would have been your Œ 

A: He was Œ well, he™s a cousin, first cousin. 

Q: He™s cousin for you. 

A: He was the son of my great-uncle.

Q: But for hi m too, it™s a point of, in some ways, of honor, that he had made a 
promise, and he wanted to keep that promise.  

A: That™s ri ght. And that happened many, many years later. But i t was Œ it would 

have been, had that happened earlier, somet hing which could have led hi m to be 

like m y father. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: As it happened, this was in the 30s, and then, the next thing that happens is, as 

we are desperately trying to get out, and I™m t old that we had this offer of this 

fellowship from 
Yale
. 

Q: Right. 

A: But the fascists were not anxious to have people who were so arti culate, as m y 

parents bot h were, come and tell people here, what things were like. Because 
Mussolini
 was saying he made the trains run on ti
me.
 
Q: Right. 
A: All nonsense, you know, all nonsense, because for instance, he came and 

opened the great new hospital that my father™s chief had gotten money for. It was 

all anti-fascist, but 
Mussolini
 came and opened it, and all  the newspapers said that. 
So the y di dn™t want people here to sa y what it was really l ike. And so the story i s, 

that when our appli cati on for a temporary visa, to go for a term, which should have 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
44
 
been granted, somebody was told, every ti me i t comes to the top of a pile, put it at 
the bottom. Fortunately, bureaucrats don™t ri p up paper. So it got  put at the bottom. 

This being 
Italy
, we al so had somebody i n that office who was told, every ti me it  
goes to the bottom Œ 

Q: Bring it  to the Œ 
A: Œ move it near t he t op. He Œ neither of thes e people Œ this Œ this person didn™t  
have the stamp. Fi nally, finall y, one da y the guy who was supposed to put it at the 

bottom wasn™t there, and the guy Œ our guy had put it near the top, and the guy who 

was stamping was just stamping, so we got permi ssion. But by this ti me, it was into 

ni Œ late 1938, and everything had changed, because the raci al laws had been 

passed. So at that point, we really didn™t even need that, because we were being Œ 

we could be kicked out. But the importance of a fellowship is that it gave us a way 
of coming into the 
Uni ted States
. Because 
United States
 wasn™t accepting people. 
Q: Now, do you Œ did your parent s ever tel l you about any experi ences they might 
have had wi th the 
U
.
S
. officials in 
Italy
, to be able to come to the 
U
.
S
.? 
A: We were never tol d that. I do know that wit h this invitation to go, my father 

went and gave a lecture in 
Brussels
. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
45
 
A: And there got, at the American consulate there, immigration papers, because we 
had this invitation of a fellowship, and we had gotten somebody who had had 

business dealings with one of my grandparent s, to sign an affidavit. There™s a story 

about that, because that person thought that we would never need money, because 

we were very wealthy, and they expected that we had mone y ab
road. Butboth my 
grandparent s were, as I said, patriots of the old school, and they had no money 
abroad. 

Q: Everythi ng was in 
Italy
. 
A: Everythi ng was in 
Italy
, because that was t he law, and the y abi ded by it, even 
though they were anti-fascist. But these persons, and interesting was a long term 

story about that, about when we arrived, had signed their affidavit. So with that , 

since the Italian quota was not being met, because you couldn™t leave 
Italy
 
if you 
were Œ unless you were Jewish and being kicked out. So it was relatively easy for 

us, with this invitation, and with these, to get permission Œ  

Q: From t he Americans. 

A: Œ from the Americans. So we left 
Italy 
with Œ as if we were going for a term Œ 

Q: Let™s stop Œ 

A: Œ and came to 
America
, when we landed, as if we were with regular 

immigration papers. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
46
 
Q: Oka y. I™m going to step back a l ittle bit . If I understood you correctl y, you were 
sayi ng, according t o, let™s sa y, the Italian bureaucracy, you were leaving 

temporarily Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ for just a term. According to t he American bureaucracy, you were 
immigrating to the compa Œ country. 
A: Because we had bot h kinds of papers. 

Q: Papers. Now, somewhere I read that your leaving 
Italy
 was not such a 
straightforward thi ng, either. 

A: Well 
Œ 
Q: That it was one ship, and then another ship. 

A: Yeah. What happened was that my mother™s parents were very much against our 
leaving. They thought, even though the raci al l aws had been passed, t hey thought 
that everything would be oka y. And in some ways, well, things were difficult, 

especially if you weren™t wealthy, if you were really wealthy, nothing very much 

happened until 1943, when 
Italy
 surrendered, and the Germans came in. 
Q: I™m going to interrupt here, I™m sorry to do that, but before we proceed with the 

story, there are going to be people who don™t know what  the racial laws were Œ 

A: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
47
 
Q: Œ and what year t hey were passed. 
A: In 1938, at the end of 1938, 
Mussolini
, who had previously not been 

particularly with 
Hi tler
 Œ at one point he had sent troops t o the Austrian border to 
keep 
Hitler 
from movi ng into 
Austria
, but had decided to side with 
Hitler
. And 
there had been people around hi m who were anti-Semitic. But anyway, whether 
from Œ not so much from his point of view, he was a nasty man, but t hat Œ but 
going along with 
Hitler
, passed laws restri cting Jews in any number of dramatic 
ways. On t he face of them, they were absolutel y catastrophic, and some things hit 

directly. For instance, you couldn™t teach i n universities, or anyplace else. And so 

m y father and m y aunt were i mmediately kicked out of their positions as professors 

at that ti me. 

Q: This is your aunt who taught psychol ogy?  
A: This is m y aunt who taught psychology. And so the y Œ  you know, i n that, you 
also were not allowed, supposedly, to have hel p of a
nybodywho was Catholic. But 
of course, some of the help you™d alwa ys had, would sta y on, and you also got help 

of somebody Œ we had a French governess who was a Protestant. We didn™t realize 

what that meant, but there it was, if you were wealthy. Now, you  supposedly could 

not hold properties of certain sorts, and more t han a certain amount Œ and I™ll have 

more to sa y about t hat, how that was avoided. And you al so were not supposed to 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
48
 
go to school, to the public schools. So these were draconic laws, and they had an 
effect on any number of people, and created anti-Semitism, whi ch by and large in 

Italy
 had not been. There had been some church anti-Semitism, and some church 
philo-Semitism. There were people in the Cat holic church who were very pro-Jews, 

and you
 
know,all that complication
s. But  these laws were passed, and at that point, 
any number of things happened. As to schools, the Catholic schools, Jesuit schools 
were open. They were private schools. So that many of m y cousi ns went to Jesuit 

schools, because the y weren™t the public schools. 

Q: What about you and your brother? 

A: We were still, that year, we were still in public school s. So at  1938, we w
ere 

still in public school. The matter is more complicated because Œ and t his is 

something I hadn't real Œ realized, but it explai ns some things that m y oral histori an 
found, that in the Italian racial laws, who was not considered Jewi sh for certain 
purposes, i ncluding owning of property, was a very compl icated matt er. Unlike 

Germany
, where if you had Jewi sh blood, end of it; if you were the product of a 
mixed marriage, and were Christian, you were considered Christian for purposes of 

owning property. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
49
 
A: And you could conti nue owning property. Now, there might be di fficulties and 
so on, but you could. My mother™s father was born of a Catholi c mother, who died 

when he was born. 

Q: Right, in childbirth. 

A: At that point, he converted to Catholicism, with the help of a Dominican who 
was very anti-fascist Œ 
Q: So as an o Œ as a grown man, he converted. 

A: As a grown man in 1938. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: With the help of a man who was a very important Dominican, fiercely anti-

fascist, fought with the partisans later. His name was 
Patrick Azatti
(ph), I knew 

hi m, I met hi m after the war, he was a great man. He cou Œ m y grandfather 
converted, and told everybody in his fami ly, al l the 
Finzi
-
Conti ni
 and their 
relatives, to convert. Because if he converted, he was a Christian, for purposes of 
the racial laws. He t hen married in this ancient , ancient Jewish family, but that was 

a 
mixed marriage. So t heir children, if they were Catholic, were also Christian i n 

terms of being able to own property. So all of these peopl e in m y mother™s family, 

were able to own propert y. 

Q: Did they all convert  after he did? 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
50
 
A: The y all converted. Some converted and it took, and t he y remained Catholic. 
Some converted and it didn™t, because the y were just converting for v Œ purposes. 

Q: Right. 

A: My grandfather actuall y, because of this memory of his mother whom he never 

knew, I thi nk actually converted. He died i n 1941, and Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. Of natural causes? 
A: Of natural causes, of cancer, and Œ and so, you know, it was in Œ but that meant 

that the properties remained in our names. 

Q: Mother™s Œ 
yeah.
 
A: In that side of the family. In m y father™s side of the family, the 
Calabresi
, there 
was myfatherand my t wo aunts. My mot her 
Œ  or, none of whom Œ my two aunts 
were not married. My father was married to my mother, and it™s at that point, only 
at that point that m y brother and I are baptized. And if I think about it, we were 
baptized because m y m other thought it was a good idea at that poi nt, and m y father 

couldn™t be, but partly because m y grandfather was sa ying, this wa y t hey will be 

able to own property. Because agai n, half, half, half, half Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ but it continues to go all the wa y through. On the 
Mi nerbi
 side, i t happened 
that m y great-uncle had two sons, and t wo daughters.

Q: So 
Pepe
(ph) Œ 
A: My Œ 
Beppe
, his older brother 
Julio
, oldest daughter 
Ginevra
, and youngest 
daughter 
Ferna nda
. 
Beppe
 and 
J ulio
 each had married C atholic women. 
Ferna nda
, the youngest, had married my mot her™s brother, who t hrough this series 
of tricks, was also Catholic. Now, their granddaughter, one of them Œ two of them 
have converted back to Judaism, and so Œ  so it  Œ it™s all Œ  
Q: It gets confusing. 

A: It gets confusing. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: 
Ginevra
 had no chil dren. Great-uncle, who owned all t hese lands and 

properties, gives them all to his grandchil dren. Why to hi s grandchildren? Because 

the y nomi nally could be Christian, for purposes of this. Now, in fact, t here were 
any number of pressures, and things a-and of course, none of this matt ers after 
1943. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: When the Germans come in. B ut it was a situation in which it looked as though, 

if you want ed to, and were rich enough, you could survive, despit e these horrible 

racial laws. 

Q: Survive and sti ll keep some of your assets. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
52
 
A: Keep your asset s, be able to study. My fat her couldn™t , and hi s si ster, who 
would, even if they converted woul d do no good, because of course, racially, they 

didn™t have a Catholic ancestors, but anyway, they wouldn™t, because the y didn™t  

want to. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Couldn™t teach. Couldn™t be Œ so it Œ t here were all sorts of restrictions, and t he y 
were horribl e. On the other hand, m y mother™s parents thought we™d be able Œ what 

a 
Œ who knows how long this wil l last? Admi nistrations come and go, and in the 

meantime, we™re able to continue to hold our properties, and do t hese things. So 

they didn™t want us to leave.  

Q: It lends logic to thei r point of view. 

A: Of course. Of course, completely logical, completely l ogical.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: This is our country, we live well. You want  to go someplace where you go 

without a penny, because it was against the law Œ I have alwa ys said under penalty 

of death, it wasn™t penalty of death, it was just people who were caught, get killed. 

But we go some strange place like t hat. So, my mother and father agree that my 

father will come to 
America
 and see Œ and to 
Yale
, and see one can really live in 
this country. And we will follow, after he™s been here two or three m onths, and

seen whether it is possible. My grandparents, well, the y had no choice in the matter 
Œ 
m y mother™s 
Œ but that was my mother, kind of. What happens i s that by now, it 
is August of 1939. 

Q: Oh m y. 

A: It is Œ t hat much ti me has passed between finally getting permi ssion, getting 
things, get ting the American things, everyt hing else. My father, supposedly is 
sailing from 
Genoa
 on the ship called the 
Conte di Savoia
, whi ch was the second 
of a great Italian ocean liners. My mother is seeing hi m off. 

Q: In 
Genoa
. 

A: In 
Genoa
. My brother and I are at 
Cortina d™Ampezzo
 in the 
Dolomites
, it™s a 
great resort t here, on that Œ near Œ 

Q: August, it™s when Œ it™s Œ 
yeah.
 
A: Œ near the Austrian border Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ 
with my mot her
™s parents. I™ve gone to bed, and I actually sai d a pra yer Œ I 

mean, I™ve j ust been baptized, I just 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Do you remember your baptism?  

A: I Œ I remember, yeah, I remember that it  was 
Don Angelo
, it  was a country 

priest at Œ 
near m y mother™s
 
family
™s
 
villa outside 
Bologna
, and this was arranged 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017

by this great 
Patrick Azatti
(ph), but it was just a local priest who talked to 
m y 
brother and me a litt le bit, and we da Œ we were baptized. We didn™t quite know 
what 
[indeciphera ble]
 but, you know. And so, for my father, who was sailing off, 
the telephone rings and it™s m y mother, who says, the shi p didn™t  sail. The y sa y it™s 

engine trouble, and that  it might sail tomorrow. Somebody in 
Rome
 has told us if it 
Œ war is breaking out. If a ship sails, and war i s breaking out, we can™t afford to be 
separated, so bring the children. If the ship sai ls, we leave tomorrow, all together. 

Q: So your mother ha Œ gets this phone call from 
Rome
.  
A: Got it Œ  I mean, the ship didn™t sail, she called somebody in 
Rome
, or m y father 
called somebody in 
Rome
.  
Q: Yeah, ri ght. 

A: Found out Œ 
Q: The circumst Œ 
A: Œ what was going on. Told her parents, bri ng the children, we may sail 

tomorrow. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: My mother goes back to 
Milan
 that da y, tells the maids, put everyt hing that i s in 
the wardrobe rooms in trunks, because we™re l eaving. My father, since you couldn™t 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
55
 
bring money out, had shirts and things, cl othes made that would last him. He di dn™t 
buy a shirt for 15 years. 

Q:Oh m y goodness.
 

A: You couldn™t bring mone y out, but at l east Œ 

Q: He had clothes. 
A: Œ so he wouldn™t co Œ so he was Œ had all hi s clothes. Our clothes, no. I mean, 
everything i n wardrobe rooms get s dumped into trunks, and what was in wardrobe 

rooms wasn™t what  you would use every da y. So Œ but we found our diapers there, 

which were made into sheets for examining beds for m y father here, because you 

couldn™t affo Œ anywa y, and my grandparents are told to bring 
Paul
 and me to 
Genoa
. I remember the trip perfectly Œ 

Q: Tell me. 
A: Œ because we couldn™t get a sleeper Œ 
Q: You were going by train, yes. 

A: Œ that late. We took the train. My grandfather had a chauffeur, but he wouldn™t 

have had him up in the mountains, he had a chauffeur at the Œ at Œ at his villa, an-

and there Œ so we Œ wit h our nanny, the same nanny who had been with us, and so 

we are all in this first cl ass carriage, and I thought that was wonderful, because 

families like ours, parents went first class, the nanny and t he children went second

class, not third class, but so that t he y wouldn™t bother people in first class. This was 
th-the way i t was done, polite, children 
[indeci pherable]
.  And so I loved these 
very thick, red, velvet cushions and things, and all excited because we were going 

to 
America
. We didn™t know what that was, but m y brother announced we were 
going to 
America
. My mother™s parents are sit ting there with their hands on thei r 
canes, looki ng like deat h. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Because their daughter was leavi ng, and they didn™t know if the y would ever see 

her again. In fact, m y grandfather died Œ it was an interesting story about that, and 

she never saw hi m, when we left, again. My grandmother survived. And Œ oka y, so

be bombed. And in fact, when war did finally come, all our furniture was in a 
warehouse, and magnificent furniture, was all hit by a bomb, end of that. And our 

house was damaged, and other things like that. Where do you go? Well, you go to a 

country villa outsi de of 
Bologna

Q: That™s your father sayi ng that.

Fellini
? 
A: Œ th-the Œ the great ship of the Italian lines, that it won the blue ribbon for going 

across fastest

 is sailing on a Œ on September ei ghth. The reason is 

that war has broken out, but 
Italy
 has decided not to join. 
Italy
 has decided not t o 
go into the war. The y don™t go int o the war unt il June of 1940, when t hey attacked 

France
. The hand, 
Roosevelt
 says, that has held the dagger, has plunged it into the 
back of its friend. So Œ so

 is not joining, the ship is sailing. I turned to say this

to my mother, in this wonderful villa, which my grandfather, who was old ha Œ

lights, I think flashing

. I turned to sa y to her Œ t here makes a 
scene 
totally in mind, and the phone rings before I can sa y, it™s my fat her calling 

from 
Milan
, saying that he has tickets on that ship. He had heard before, and had 
already gotten it. That day, the trunks arri ve.

A: On the ship.

Q: I want t o hear about it. 
A: Well, you know, a trip was this fancy ship, and we were doing all sorts of fun 

things, and my brother, who is more of a packrat, kept all t he things from the 

captain, so t hat on anniversaries he™d bring them out from the capt ain™s table, and 

all the stuff, and how much we di d one da y, and everythi ng else. And Œ all of which 
was wonderful, and land in 
New York
. One problem. Because we didn™t think we

Yale

A: Yeah, was when we were Œ he was planning to go, and see if you could live, and 

then we would join hi m. 

Q: Didn™t happen. 
A: It didn™t happen. The fellowship doesn™t begin til January.  
Q: Oka y, at  this point Œ 
excuse me.
 
A: And that is Œ and 
Yale
 is not i nterested at all in being helpful. I™ll  have more t o 

say about t hat. So that we arrive on a Saturday, i n

A: Yeah. 

Q: I want t o Œ bef ore we do that, t hough, I™d li ke to go back to

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and notice that  al most everybody st a yed. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Not everybody. My mother™s sister Œ

A: Œ left before we did. Why? 

Q: Yeah, why? 

A: She was married to a man named 
Gui do  Tedeschi
. There are any number of 
people named 
Guido Tedeschi
, but this 
Guido Tedeschi
 was of a family that was 
even Œ well, in 
Bol ogna
, which was a bigger cit y, and they were very, very fancy, 

they were among the wealthiest people there. Their family owned the palace that

had belonged to the great enlightenment pope from 
Bologna
 Œ they st ill own it, I 
think Œ 
Benedict 
the 13, 14, something. Some
 
Benedic
t
. And the y had been 
admirals and diplomats and all sort s of things like that. My aunt™s husband™s father, 

as a young diplomat, had been consul general of 
Italy
 in 
Sao Paolo
,
 Brazil
.  
Q: 
Brazil
. 
A: The head where al l the Italian communi ty and finances were, wonderful position 
for a young Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ diplomat. And so my uncle, my aunt™s husband, grew up in 
Brazil
, with this 
diplomatic family. 

Q: Can you ask me Œ can you tell me, 
Tedeschi
, is that a Jewish famil y, or not? 
A: Jewish, Jewish. 
Q: Jewish, okay. 
A: Jewish.  

Q: So he could joi n the diplomatic service? 

A: Oh yes, all this, you know, I mean, you know, 
Italy
, at that ti me, before this, 
Jews in 
Italy
 Œ after the unification of 
Italy
, Jews were totally everywhere. If you 
go to Lake 
C
omo

somebody or other, who is clearly Jewish. The fir Œ first ma yor of 
Rome
, after the 
unification of 
Italy
 is somebody named 
Nath an
, actually related to t he 
Rosselli  
brothers, whom I talked about before. 
Q: Right. 

A: The chief justice of 
Italy
, of  the Court of 
Cassation
, in the early days of fascism 
is a man named 
Mortada
(ph), who is Jewish, who tries t o use, what i n 
America
 
would be judicial review to strike down fascist decrees, but there™s no tradition of 

it, and so i t fails. And Jews are Œ if the y were of great families, were all over. And 

this one was a parti cularl y old and very, very fanc y. 
Tedeschi
, by the way, suggests 
Ashken
azi
m
, because 
Tedeschi
 means German, it means deutsche, it™s the name 
Ashkenazi. So if you see somebody, the name 
Tedeschi
 often is Jewish in 
Italy
, 
and it meant Œ 
Q: German. 
A: Œ deutsche. Ashkenazi. 

Q: Mm-hm, deutsche. 

A: But his mother™s family, instead was Italki m and very fancy. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Anywa y, he grows up in 
Brazi l
, his father dies young, while there. So they 

return to 
Italy
. The y return to 
Italy
,he meets m y 
mother™s sister. Perfect marriage,

you know, right kind of families, and so on, and they get married. He is a ch-
chemist, and the y are Œ she is mil dly actively anti-fascist, he is not. He is of this 

family that was too conservative, and so on. C ome the racial laws, he™s insulted. 

You know, he™s si mply insulted by this. And he says, why shoul d I stay here? I 

have all my friends in 
Brazil
, whom I grew up with, when his father was, in fact, 
the head of a communit y t here, of a whole Itali an financial communit y in 
Sao 

Paolo
, which is the center of Italian business in Œ so he and his wife, m y aunt, and 

two sons, go off to 
Brazil
. 

Q: And thi s woul d be in 30 Œ 
early ™39?
 
A: Thirty-
s 
Œ ™38. 

Q: Still ™38? 

A: The y al most i mmedi Œ ™38, maybe begi nni ng of ™39, but you know, almost 
immediately for him it™s not an issue of anythi ng else. 
From t
he moment there 
are 
racial laws, he has all t hese friends there Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: Œ any number of ways, goes, and they™ve Œ that family has lived in 
Brazil
 ever 

since. 

Q: So that™s Mama™s one sister. 

A: One sister.

Q: What about Œ 
A: Her brothers, of course, stay. There™s no reason for them to leave. The only 

other person to leave is a cousin on the si de of the Œ 
m y fa 
Œ 
m y mother™s mother, 
this ancient , ancient line, whose uncle, double first cousin of m y grandmother Œ 

two brothers had married two sist ers Œ was the great law professor in 
Italy
. 
Professor, dean, president of 
Rome
 Universit y, t he greatest law li brary i n the 

world, a fascist. The onl y fascist in the family. He actually was Minister of 

Education for a short ti me. The family ostraci zes him. 

Q: What is his name? 

A: His name was 
Giorgio Del Vecchio
, 
Del Vecchio 
meaning 
Zekanym
(ph), and 
he was this great figure, still is. His books are all over Cat holic universities and so 

on. 
Roscoe Pound
, the great dean of 
Harvard
 adored him because he was a 
functionalist. He made the law do what the Œ was needed now. Why? Because he 

was a fascist. All the anti-fascists were formal ists, using the law can™t  be changed 

to block this. So 
Roscoe Pound
 makes him a member of the American Academ y, 
and so on. This guy, by the wa y, come 1943, i s so famous that he just walks into 

the Vatican, and is fine. That™s how he is saved. But he was with great figure. His 

nephew, a brilliant young professor, already a full professor, says, we have lived

off this snobbery for 2,000 years. It has come home to roost. He™s in opposition to 
his uncle. I am going to 
Palestine
. 

Q: And he does? 

A: And he does. And he goes there, and he becomes the founder, in 1948, of the 

Hebrew University Law School, and the teacher of everybody there; 
Aram 
Barak
(ph), 
Yitzhak E nglard
, and so on.  
Q: What was his name? 

A: Also, strangely enough, 
Guido Tedeschi
. 
Guy Tedeschi
, because his father was 
Ashkenazi, his mother was 
Del Vecchio
. The story of how he lived t here is 
interesting, because he had to discover Œ t here was no uni versity for him to teach, 

he had to di scover some Sephardic ancestor, because there was a fellowship gi ven 

to Sephardi cs, and he finds one on his mother™s side, 
Ava Dzemorani
(ph), and Œ 
who, his family st arted the first newspaper in 
Italy
, m y rel atives, t oo. An
d  anyway, 
we just Œ I have it very much in mind because just two weeks ago I was in 
Italy
, 
and one of the things that was going on in 
Ital y
 was a great celebrat ion of this man, 
on the 110
th
 anniversary of his birth, with all t he people from 
Israel
; 
Englard
, 
Arak
(ph), all these people coming, and who were his students, and all  other peopl e 

in 
Italy 
celebrating this great scholar, who had gone. So he left. But he was a 

cousin, I mean Œ 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
67
 
Q: Sure, yeah. 
A: Œ is a double second cousin, but cousi n. My aunt left and went t o 
Brazil
, and we 

went to 
America
, mainly because wewereanti
-fascist. Everybody else sta yed. 
Q: What happened t o t hem? 

A: Everybody survived. 
Q: How?  
A: That is a series of stories which is the book that I am writing. And the stories are 

wonderful, and the y are Œ they™re interesting i n themselves. But the most 

interesting part of them are the motives of the people who saved t hem, in many 

instances ri sking t heir l ives to save them. And the people who saved t hem ranged 

from the poorest peasants, who didn™t even know them, t o, in some instances, to t he 

wealthiest grandees, everyt hing in between. People did things in 
Italy
, which the y 
did nowhere else. Now, I don™t mean to sa y there weren™t some people who were 

terrible and did other things. I™m just telli ng the story of m y family, and every 

single blood relative of mi ne was saved. The family of 
Montini
, who became pop Œ 

Pope 
Paul
 the sixth, saved one branch. The y did it, why? And that™s the interesting 
thing of this book, what were the motives? Someti mes it was sheer humanity, 

someti mes it was friendship, because we were friends. Someti mes it was gratitude, 

because we had done things for them. Someti mes it was fame. Respect for fame. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
68
 
Someti mes motives unknown. But every one of Œ I told you of the fascist, great 
scholar and so on, who walks into the Vatican, and Œ which was not open to 

[indecipherable]
 Jews. But he wal ks in, perfectl y fine, continues his studies there. 

His double first cousin, my great-uncle, who had been president of a 
Bocconi 
University of 
Milan
, economist 
Gustavo Del Vecchio
, great economist, kicked out 
by the fascists, because he was anti -fascist. And he, with his sister, who had a 

house on Lake 
Como
, gets in a boat, and goes to 
Switzerland
. 
Switzerland
 
is not 

open, any more than the Vatican is. He get s off. The Swiss guard is ready to send 

hi m back, he takes out a letter from 
Einaudi
, who later becomes president of 
Italy
, 
and who was his great pal, who was teaching at 
Zurich
, inviting him to teach at 
Zurich
. The Swi ss guards salute, send for a li mousine, and he gets taken there. 
Exactly the same thi ng as the other one, as his double cousin. Thi s guy, anti-fascist, 
after the war he comes back, becomes a cabinet minister in a post war government . 
When one is up, the other is down. Analogous thing of how the y were saved. 

Funny. 

Q: What does this Œ 
yeah .
 
A: O-Others just Œ a-and I™ll tell you just one story, it™s not Œ 

Q: Oh please. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

A: Œ there are others that are more dramatic, but longer. My great -
grandmother; my 
mother™s mother™s mot her 
Œ  
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ a remarkable woman, whom I remember well, because she was old, but ali ve 

in Œ before we left, and who may have been the only one i n the family, who in 
some wa y had some el ement of practicing Judaism. She would not convert when 
everybody else converted. Neither did her son, who was t his great -uncle who went 

to 
Switzerland
, but Œ 
because he 
Œ he woul d do what his mother want ed. She was 
told to convert, she said, 
sono un
™
Israelita
,
 basta
.
 
I™m an Israelite, enough. She 

taught me a prayer. 

Q: What was it?  

A: Which must have been a Jewish pra yer. 
Q: Do you remember it ? 
A: I don™t remember it. 

Q: Aw. 

A: But I know she taught me a pra yer. She sends her son and his sister away from 

her villa, and to go off to 
Switzerland
. She is too old to survive, to go with them. 
She is in her high 80s. And so she sta ys i n this villa, and she sa ys to her son, look, 

if you stay, they™ll come and get us both. Especially because you™re famous, so 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

they™ll find you here. Me, the y ma y not pa y any attention. And in any case, I™
m not 
let Œ 
I™m 
Œ she locked t he house doors. I Œ so, but he had t o go. Off he goes. When 
the villa is liberated, she writes a 15 page letter to my mother, telling her how she 

survived. She writes it to m y mot her because she is her eldest grandchild, brilliant. 

And this remarkabl e woman, she was widowed at 23 with three children, looked 
after everything, an amazing person. And wants the story to be told. And she tel ls 
the story that she was there Œ and this is after 1943 Œ and an American plane that  

had been bombing 
Bol ogna
 had somehow failed to drop all its bombs, and is tryi ng 
to get up over the 
Apennines
 to go back home, and finds that a bomb it has let Œ 
still has, makes it difficult for it to get its height, and so opens the bomb thing, the 

bomb falls on the village next to the villa. It was during the day, everybody was out 

working, so there weren™t any real casualties, but the village is destroyed. My 
grandmother says, so I did what any decent  person woul d do, I i nvited the village 
into the vil la. And she said, every family got a room, and we set it all up, and I 

taught all t he women to work. She did wonderful needlepoint. And I t aught the men 

to pla y poker. She was of a generation before bridge, it was what card pla ying 

people would do. We had a wonderful ti me, she said, and she describes this 

wonderful thing, with t he whole vi llage living in the villa all toget her. This al most 

90 year old, tiny lit tle person, just teaching. She was alwa ys a teacher, and doing 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

these other things. And then she said, the Germans arrived. They had heard that 
there was an old Jewish lady there. So the y came to get me. And the village men 

came out with pitchforks, hatchets, you know, and said to the German captain, over 

our dead bodies. They had been taken in. And the German captain looks at it, and 

realizes that, of course, he could mow them down, but he™s probably l ose some 
men, and it would be Œ and thinks, here™s an almost 90 year old person, she™s gonna 
die anyway. It isn™t  worth it. And goes awa y. 

Q: Amazing. 

A: And that™s how she survived. 

Q: Amazing. 

A: And that™s one of the stories. The stories of the others are all different, all 

wonderful, and are part  of the thing. I™ll tell Œ just sa y two other t hings about that . 
One, 
Beppe™s
 father, the person whose great house it was, refused to hide. 
Q: This is in 
Ferrara
?  
A: In 
Ferrara
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And no one knows why he refused to hide. Some people sa y t hat he thought that 

if he was there and was taken, his children Œ they might leave his children alone. 

Which, of course, would not have happened. No one knows. There i s reason to 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
72
 
believe that he was t he prototype for the ol d professor in ﬁ
The Garden of the 
Finzi-Contini
,ﬂ who wouldn™t hide because it was beneath them. 

Q: So this is the 
Finzi
-
Contini 
family head  
A: This is Œ the book is being writt en Œ 

Q: That™s ri ght. 
A: Œ under the patronage of this guy™s son, and somebody Œ some people have 
written Œ 
Sergio Minerbi
, the guy Œ  

Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: Œ who has written in 
Israel
, has written a family history, and he says it™s true, I 

don™t know how he knows. But it™s plausible that the model for that Œ 

Q: Is the Œ 

A: Œ not hi ding, because it Œ 
because 
Œ in t he garden it was because it was beneath 
them. We don™t know Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ why t his guy? He actually get s taken, and would have been sent off, taken by 

the fascists, would have been turned over t o the Germans, and would have been 

sent off. The story of how he is rescued by his chauffeur, is another wonderful 

story, one version of which was written up in a book called ﬁ
Alberto Ms Longest 

Day
.ﬂ 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
73
 
Q: I saw that on the int ernet, I wondered what  that was. 
A: Yeah. That book was written by m y cousin, m y double cousin Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ the one I was t elli ng you about before Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ who was a professor of geophysics, but was also a poet and an author. And he 
wrote this, which is pa Œ that story™s partly fiction. That Œ how that happened is 

partly fiction, it was meant to be Œ 

Q: The longest journey, yeah, that longest Œ  

A: Œ a fiction, at the longest journe y. 

Q: Œ 
journe y, yeah.
 

A: But it™s how this guy, who didn™t try to hide, was none the less rescued by his 
chauffeur, who was a 
Figaro
 type, who could do anything, and did it. So Œ so that™s 
another. But anyway, t hese stories are something that when my book comes out, 

will all be t here, all of it. What I di d want to say was, what happened to my 

mother™s father, because it has some interesting things for m y job as a judge, 

actually. In 1940, before 
America
 j oins the war, m y mother™s father develops 
cancer, and he was, as I sa y, a neurologist, way back. Turns out not t o be operable, 

though probably Œ don™t know why, but i t was cancer, but sometimes i t™s curable, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
74
 
but it wasn™t. He forbids anybody from tel ling m y mother. This i s a man, 
remember, who didn™t want my mother to leave, but he forbids anybody from 

telling my mother that he is sick, because he knows that if m y mother knows that, 

she™ll get on the first ship and go back. And probably end up separated from her 

family.
 
Q: Wow.
 

A: My mother first hears that he is sick in a tel egram from the fami ly saying that he 

is dying, in early 1941, before 
America
 is i n t he war. 
Italy 
is in t he war now.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And sa yi ng that he i s dying. And so i n Œ actually, she first hears from a telegram 

of condolences over fa Œ first from m y father™s sister, who is in 
Italy
. And the thing 
is Œ interesting to me as a judge, because I™ve seen cases Œ I™ve sat on cases where 
the board of i mmigration appeals and i mmigration judges said somebody, who said 
they were persecuted, and has sought asyl um, went back t o their country, and then 

came back. So it cannot be that they were being persecuted. And we had a case, 

and people on a panel with me, t he other two judges, were ready t o say obviously 

that™s so. And I sai d no, it™s not obviously so. Of course it™s relevant i f the person 

goes back, and you want to find out why. But I can tell you that that i sn™t 

necessarily so, and here is this st ory. And so m y panel held that you cannot make it

as a matter of law that somebody who goes back can™t, you have t o look to see wh
y 
they went back Œ 
Q: The circumstance, yeah. 

A: Œ and so on. So those are a couple of stories. The others survi ved, as I sa y, in 

wonderful, mixed ways, and I Œ  
Q: You know, when you™re Œ this kind of outcome, there are lots of questions, and I 
understand you™ve got a book that is in the Œ in the worki ng, and I, you know, i t™s 

whetting m y appeti te for it. But t he stories that you are sa yi ng, and the summary 

that you are giving, spell a kind of experience that too many other people did not 

have in other countries. 

A: That is true. And one of the reasons I want to write this, is because what 

happened in 
Italy
 Œ and again, now some people, including some c-cousin of mine, 
are writing about the people in 
Italy
 who did betra y, who did behave badly. But  
more people were saved in 
Italy
, than in any other country, with a possible 
exception of 
Denmark
. And in 
Denmark
 it was the official policy of the king, and 
people just followed it wonderfully, and peopl e were saved. In 
Italy
, what was 
interesting about it was that it was against the polic y of the government, and yet 

people behaved in wa ys which saved people. Now, a fair number of people were 

taken. About 10,000 people were taken in 
Rome
, right after 
Italy 
surrendered, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

becausethe Roman Jewishcommunity was 
Œ  there was an old community around 
the old Italian temple, of people who were relatively poor, and st ill living there, as 
against all these assimi lated people all over. They too didn™t think that anything 

was going to happen. And the Germans moved in, and t ook any number of them, a 

few days, ri ght after. And it™s that  that gave the signal, and everybody else went 
hid, afterwards. So it immediately,  a fair number. So if you look a fair number of 
people were taken. Aft er that, very, very few people were taken, because Italians 

hid people. Why? That™s part of the story of this book. I mean, sometimes, just 

hum
anity. Someti mes 
Œ and you know, somet imes the churches hid people. The 
cardinal archbishop of 
Florence
 was ma ybe t he only man to vot e against 
Pius
 the 

12
th
 
[inde
cipherable]
. He was much loved by people, and the y tell the story, which 
I repeat in the book, but it isn™t my story, but Œ but he tol d all the monasteries and 
nunneries t o hide peopl e. And that some people were being hidden in a nunnery, 
which had been a closed nunnery, and there were men who were being hidden, and 

Œ and young men and young nuns, and inevitably people started maki ng love, and 

the Mother Superi or is said, according to the story, that i s very popular with 

Florentines, goes t o the cardinal and sa ys, t erri ble sins are being commit ted here, 

we cannot have this goi ng on. And the cardinal says, Mot her, what do you think is

worse? What is happening there, or to turn people out to be killed? Don™t worry 
about it, it™s on me. 

Q: It™s a lovely story. 

A: Which i s a lovely st ory, I mean Œ  

Q:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
A: Œ you know, this is a story that is told there, and there are squares named after 

this guy, and so on. So, yeah, you know, sometimes, as I sa y, it was j ust humanity. 

And there are people who Œ Italian peasant s who hid Jews, partisans, anti-fascists, 

and then, when the war turned around, and Germans were running away, hid them. 

The y were all people in trouble, one said t o me, when the y came here. 
E tutti figli 

de mama
, the y were all some mother™s child. We struggled for them. 
Q: Si mple, but very profound. 
A: And it™s a Œ you know, a very Œ there was something about that culture Œ and I 
don™t mean there weren™t people who didn™t, but there was something about that 

culture that caused people to save people. And by the wa y, it is the reason why 

almost all Italian Jews who fled, went back. 

Q: You ant icipated my next questi on. 

A: We did not. And a few others did not, but most people did go back to 
Italy
, in a 
way that people did not go back to 
Germany
, for sure, or 
Poland
, or other

countries, because t he feeling that after all, t hat 
Italy 
has Œ and by the wa y, if you 
said Œ you know, somebody could say there were so few Jews in 
Italy
, and they 
were so assi milated, and so on Œ t hat was true in many other countries as well, but 

Œ but there are some figures that give the l ie to that, because it™s said that about 

10,000 Jews from 
Croatia
, from t he Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Who had been protected when it was Italian territory, and was a whole thing of 

Germans trying to find out whether these people were really Italians, or from 

someplace el se, or something, but  who were not at all Italian, they were Œ when 

Italy 
surrendered, fled into 
Italy
 from 
Croati a
. And it™s said that of these 10,000 
people who fled, who were completely unassi mil ated, only eight  people were 

taken. So it Œ people were hidden. And it™s Œ i t™s something about Œ and who 
knows? I mean, you know, that™s one of the reasons I™m writing this book, because 
each of us, in our li ves, faces situations where we ma y be called on to do things, 

and there are always excuses. And these peopl e were riski ng their lives. 

Q: I was thinking of this question as you were speaking. Or shall I put  it Œ this i s 

half a question, half a comment. I™ve interviewed people who are Œ I™ve 

interviewed people who are Jewish survivors from 
Germany

you just mentioned, or from 
Poland

Germany

more, but they can t race back that much. And someti mes when I™ve met  them, t he y 
speak Engli sh wit h a German accent. Some of them still speak very good German, 

you know, it™s their first language. And I will sometimes ask the quest ion, so what 

part of you is German? And it™s very hard to answer. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Very, very hard to answer, because there was such a profound rejection. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And the rejection was not just state edicts, it went through society. But it also 

prevented someone who was the target of these edicts, and laws, and 

discri mination, from taking that which had been part of them, and being able to 

incorporate i t, and keep it. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And as you™re speaking, you know, to ask you what part of you is Italian Œ 
A: A hundred percent. I mean, you know, 
m y 
Œ I™m a hundred percent Italian, I am 
Jewish. I™m a hundred percent American, because I have become American. And I 

have stories about t hat. When I was talking to some students from foreign 

countries, who were here on a program, and a kid from 
Pakistan
 who had grown 

up in Œ in 
Denmark
, actually, sai d, you know, that™s all very well, but which are

you? And I said, I™m both. And then he said something kind of fun, he said, oka y, 
but whom do your root  for when there™s a World Cup in soccer? And I Œ 

Q: When the rubber meets the road.  
A: Yeah. My answer was automati c. Of course I root for 
Italy
. But if it were a 
world cup i n baseball, I™d root for reuta Œ 
United States
. And it™s not that the 
United States
 is better in one than in the other. In the last World Cup, 
United 
St
ates
 was good and 
Italy
 was terrible. It™s just that I associate one with 
Italy
, and 
so then I™m Italian. And I associate the other one with 
America
, and so of course, 
I™m a Yankee fan, of baseball. And that™s the way that is. And I am i n that sense, 

why d
idn™t  we go back? And that™s an interesting story in itself, which has to do in 
a way, with what™s happened later, but think of it this way. Comes lat e 40s, 50s, m y 

parents go back and see, and are undecided. My father probably is leaning towards 
going back.  
Q: He who wanted to l eave. 

A: He who wanted to l eave, but you know, fine. 
My mother ma y be morelikely to 

want to stay here, oddl y, because my father had been able Œ his fami ly, his sister 

and his mother, after the war, had joined us here, or were going to join us if we Œ 

but he thinks in terms of going back, maybe. He is having a career here, but yeah, 

you know. My mother, oddly in some ways, because it is easier for a woman, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

81
 
strangely, t o have a career in 
Italy
 than here Œ she couldn™t get appointed to the 
Yale 
facult y, though they tried, because women were not teaching at 
Yale
 at the 
time. But she thinks if she goes back, people will not take her career seriously, 
because she is too much this elegant lady, you know, and that Œ but they™re 

uncertain. So the thing falls, in many wa ys, on m y brother and me. And m y brother 
and I, separately, first he goes back, because he™s older. Then a couple of years 
later, I go back. And we both have the same reaction, that it woul d be horrible to go 

back to 
Italy
 and b e poor, because t his is after the war, and everything is still Œ but 
to go back t o 
Italy
 and be who we were, wi th all the losses, because buildings were 
hit, things were not looked after, properties had to be put in other names 

[indecipherable]
 the 
Calabresi 
things to survi ve, because t he y didn™t  fit to that 

category, and so on. So we were not as rich, by any means, as we were before, but 
we™re still. But to go back and be wealthy, was something that we were too 
American, too egalitarian to conceive of doing.  

Q: 
It made you
 
that, yeah.
 

A: We had become out siders, coming to 
America
, and to be insi ders, as we would 
have been there, was something t hat m y brother and I, bot h insti nctively, could not 

take. I will tell you my own experience in t hat. I go with the chauffeur who saved 

Alberto M
,
 
who was still there. He drives me around to see the famil y lands. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

Q: This is in the early 50s? 
A: 1951. I should have gone in ™50, didn™t  go because of the breakout of the Korean 

war. Drive around i n the ancient family 
Lanci
a
, which still exist s. He™s driving, 
I™m sitting in what would be the driver™s seat, because snobbery among Italians, 

you have the driver on the English side, to copy English cars, although you™re 
driving Œ so, madness. So I™m there, you know, thinking I™m driving, as we go 
sweeping down. A littl e religious processi on comes along, and the y see the family 

Lancia
. The y all pull t o one side, and bow. I™m a teenager. Who are these people 

bowing to me? We go by a church, and I sa y, that™s a very beautiful church, and Œ 

little tiny church Œ and the chauffeur says yes, you own it . Well, your cousin owns 

it. And the bell is even more beautiful, and of course, it™s in 
Ferrara
 because it™s 
too beautiful to leave out here. I can™t take t hat. So we sa y to my parents, we want 
to sta y. And that™s what makes the decision. 
Q: Amazing. 

A: We stay. Because they were undecided, I mean, the y real ly, essentiall y, left it up 

to us. The irony of this, of course, is that we di d not see the great i nequalities in t he 

United States
. Remember, blacks were not visible. It™s before 1953, before 
Brown
 

vs Board of Education. All the inequalities of the 
United States
 are kind of hidden 

to kids just growi ng up in a university town. In the meanti me Œ

Q: But it™s just over the horizon. 
A: Just over the horizon. In the meantime, in 
Italy
, 1950, partly due to my great-
uncle going to the cabi net and beco ming Mini ster of the Treasury 
[indecipherable]
 

the great Ital ian miracl e of the 50s and 60s, which changes 
Italy
 into an al most 
totally middle class society. Toda y, all these land are owned by farmers. The 
church is a little museum owned by there, the bell is back there. We own nothing of 
that. We™re still well-off, but not the kind of feudal thing Œ in many ways, by 1970, 
Italy
 is a much more egalitarian society than i s the 
United States
. In some wa ys 
not, less mobility, but i n many wa ys. So t hat the irony of our deci sion was that we 

were moved by very good things. Whether it t he right one or not Œ  

Q: Or whether it was, in the end, what eventually happened Œ 

A: That™s ri ght. 
Q: Œ in reali ty or not. You know, i t was Œ 
A: Yeah, just sa y it, yeah. 

Q: Œ the Œ one of the leitmotifs through your story is irony, and contradiction. 
A: That™s ri ght, that™s right. 

Q: You know, thi s is true, but this also is true. 

A: And here is Œ and here is another contradiction. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

A: That the result of that is that my brother marries a woman who was a classmate 
of mine in elementary school, of an old, ol d, ol d 
New Haven
 family. I marry 
Anne
, 
whose ancestors were the first governor of the first Œ and 
Eli Yale™s
 grandmother. 

The founders of 
New Haven
, and are wonderful, wonderful people, whom we 
would not have married, if we™d gone back. And if Œ our bridal rehearsal luncheon 
that m y parents gave, my father gets up and shocks everybody by giving a toast to 
Benito Mussoli ni
, because if it were not for him, and all his evil, 
Paul
 
would not 
have married 
Celia
, and 
Guido
 
would notbe marrying 
Ann
e
.  
Q: Oh, oh.  

A: Again, the ironies Œ 

Q: Irony. 

A: Œ and contradictions of Œ 
Q: Yeah. Well, let™s go back to what ends up being yet another one. Now that you 
have said, you and your brother, decided separately that you woul d rather be here, 

the egalitarian ethos had caught you. You Œ  

A: And as outsiders. 

Q: Yes, and as out siders. 

A: Because that™s another important point  of our coming to 
America
, and what that 
meant.

Q: The Œ your first da ys, and first experiences in the 
United States

auspicious.  

A: No. 

Q: So I would like to learn about that. 

A: Yeah. First, let me j ust say one thing, because I want it on the record yet agai n, I 
do this, somebody said that we came through 
Ellis Island
. I don™t know where they 
got that idea. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The y made it up. They assumed it, and it sounds nice. I wish I™d come through 

Ellis Island
. It was there. We did not come through 
Elli s Island
. You went to 
Ellis 
Island
 if you came steerage.

A: Œ on September 16, a Saturda y. And by the way, I was sworn in as a judge on 
the 55
th
 anniversary, to the da y. 
Q: Oh, wow. 

A: I picked the day because I wanted to say somet hing about what 
America
 had 
done for me, and what it hadn't done for others, and those who had helped us, and 
those who had not, and to dedicate myself to do things for those whom 
America
 
had not hel ped. And 
David Souter
, who is an old, old friend, cause we were on 
Rhodes 
Scholarship selection committee before anybody knew who he was, who 
swore me in. This old, 
New Hampshire
 Yankee was in tears. So, we land, and 
what do you do? Well, from the ship, m y father had Œ Mother had sent a telegram 

to a distant cousin, who was the only relat ive that we had here, who had been sent 

by the fascists to study law at 
Berkeley
. 
Q: Now, was he a fascist, too? 

A: No, he was just  a kid. The reason he had been sent there was that the fascists 

had sent a variety of people who were tall and good looki ng, because the y didn™t 

want Americans to think of Italians as being short, squat southerners. So the y sent 

this very elegant Œ and as he said, shortly after he got here, the y decided I wasn™t 

Italian, because I was Jewish. 

Q: What was his name?

A: And he sta yed, and ulti mately became deput y general counsel of the

A: Yeah, yeah. And so he sends back a name, t he Hotel 
Raleigh

West Side. 
Q: 
New York City
. 
A: In 
New York City
. We land on a Saturday, go there. How cheap was it? My 
father, who is not a pack rat, kept t he bill for four people and supposed food, for 

each of two months Œ kept it for two mont hs because he had two sons. Obviou
sly 

he was doi ng it for a purpose, 10 dollars.  
Q: Ten dollars a month? 
A: Ten dollars a month. Four people, wit h food. Not a nice place, but there we 

were. 

Q:

 included?

A: I sa y supposedly because the food was awful, I found it al most i mpossible to 
eat, because I™d alwa ys eaten very 
[i ndeci phera ble]
. I was difficult. Not difficult, 
but you know, I was used to being Œ why do we stay in 
New York
 rat her than 
come to 
New Haven
 i mmediately? The fellowship doesn™t begi n til January, and 
m y father, correctly, thinks the licensure exams for medici ne, in 
New York
, have 
more reciprocity than those of 
Connecticut
. If you pass 
Connecticut
, yeah, 
Connecticut
 will recognize it, but almost none Œ al most every stat e recognizes a 

New York 
medical license. If we™re going to starve, we might as well starve in 

New York
, as in Œ 
Q: Was it as difficult in those days for a doctor, certified by another country? 

A: You had to Œ I mean, you could, with t he qualifications he had, take the exams, 

and if you passed t he exams, you would be okay. Increasingly the y made it 
difficult. Increasingly t hey made it difficult. And interesti ngly, the exams in 
New 
York
 were already making it difficult for people pri marily who came from 

Germany
, and the y did that by having the language, have all sort s of words which 
were Latinate words. Which of course, m y father, who spoke German perfectly, 

and spoke English with a huge accent Œ German was his first lang Œ second 

language, French was his third language, Engli sh he learned and knew well, but 

spoke like a cultivat ed Italian woul d, if you thought it should sound li ke German. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

Which was not good. My mother, instead, spoke English with an English accent, 
French was her second language, English her third language, because she had had 

an English governess. Have you any autumn apples? When she came, it was how 

she spoke. But he found the language exam funnily easy, because of that. The other 

exams, what he worried about most was surgery. He had been an academic, so that 
most other things to do with medi cine, even if the y weren™t his field, he would 
know. And as he said, he turned lucky in t hat, because the guy who was the 

examiner in surgery, was one of the first peopl e to do color Œ cardi ovascular 

surgery, to think about that. And he had read some articles of m y father™s as a 

cardiologist, and so knew who he was. And he said to hi m, I must gi ve you a real  

surgical question. It was an appendectomy, which even m y father coul d handle. 

And then he said, now let™s talk about interesti ng things, the future of 
cardiovascul ar surgery. So he passed that. And so he passed, flying colors, before 
the end of December, so that in January, when we came to 
New Haven
, he had his 
New York
 license. 
Q: But you know, for someone who comes in, who was wealthy and i s now 

penniless, that™s not bad for a couple of months in the new country. 

A: Not bad. Now, how did we survive Œ 

Q: Yeah, how did you survive?

it, my brot her and I get  put in school on Monday. 

Q: You arrive Saturday, on Monda y in your school. 

A: What do you do wit h children? 

Q: Yeah, that™s true. 
A: And st ory of that is another story in itself. The people at the consulate, Italian 
consulate hear of it Œ my father, who is just already quite well-known person is 

there. And a Œ there™s some count or somebody t here, who has heart t rouble, and 

asks m y father if he will look after hi m. My fat her says, I cannot do it for pay, 

because I™m not licensed. You know, I can give you some advice. And there 

arrived, at this scruffy hotel, every da y, a huge thing of flowers. My mother Œ I 

remember her saying, he might have sent fruit. But the y didn™t imagine Œ

A: Œ that we could b
e 
Œ

Jewish, I don™t know, was 
Morgan™s 
Œ he probably Œ could not  very well have 

been, at that ti me. But he Œ she had signed affidavits for all sorts of people from 

Germany
. And when, because of the connecti on between one of m y grandparent s 
and this guy, signed ours, sa ying, I know you™ll never need anything. So, my 

mother goes to call on this lady, and she had jewelry, because we™d hidden it in our 
things. And this was not jewelry we had bought; if so the y would have looked for 
it, but this was jewelry, so she Œ she said, I put on more jewelry than a lady should, 

and went to have tea, for Œ and said, our money has not yet arrived from 

Switzerland
, coul d you advance us somet hing? This was technically true because 

m y father had given a lecture in 
Switzerland
, and had gotten, I don™t know, 50 
dollars, something like that, and that mone y had not yet arrived. So it had m y Œ t his 

woman sa ys, of course, and writes a check. I do not know the precise amount. The

story sort of is, and I had an impression t hat it was for 25,000 dollars. This is 1939. 
She™s thinking of peopl e living in the wa y we lived in 
Italy
. So of course. What do 
you 
do wit h a check for 25,000 dollars at a ti me when you think the banks are st ill 

failing? You know, it™s true now we look back, the depression was over, but Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ nobody really knew it. We had no bank account anyway, but  how could you Œ 
something which we could never pa y back. What do you do with it? Well, what  

you do wit h it, there were a few other Italian émi grés, some Jewi sh, some not, who 

were there in 
New York
, that was a small  community of people, and some of them 
had a little bit of money, because t he y had had mone y out of 
Italy
. And of course, 
everybody who had that was just as Œ 

Q: Nervous. 
A: Œ tight with it as could be. Among these people, by the way, was a woman 
named 
Kalabi
(ph), who became, after the war, the head of the Itali an Jewish 

community in 
Italy
. A great, great lady. A- And she was our first babysi tter. She 
came and 
Œ one time when m y parents actuall y went to a movie, it was the only 

time, and she was with us. Well, m y parent s gave this check to some people who 

had mone y andsai d
, give us a few hundred dollars, this check wil l be your security. 

And with t hese few hundred dollars, we had barely enough mone y to live. Comes

dollars a year, which is the equival ent of about  20,000 dollars now. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: You know. Not Œ 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Perfectl y decent. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: A full professor was earning 10,000 dollars, sterling professor 12,500 at the 

time. So you know, it™s about Œ and we sent the check back, with a note saying, oh, 

terribly sorry, we found the money arrived, we didn™t need to use it, but things 

happened, so we didn™t send Œ here it is. Fine. End of story? Irony of ironies, no. 

Fast
-forward to 1961. 
Q: Wow.
 

A: 
Anne 
and I are on our wedding trip. We start in the south, to have a month, 

which is an academi c wedding tri p, I have a whole summer. A mont h where we can 

be by ourselves, because there are no relatives. Then we pl an a month from 
Rome
 
to the mountains, wall t o wall relatives, calli ng on those relatives who haven™t been 

able to come to our wedding, and so on. And t hen a month in the mountain, to

Œ so on, and sister, great-aunt, 
Anne 
goes to the 
hairdresser, nearest good hotel. The hairdresser sa ys to a woman underneath one of 
these machines, there™s a young American bri de here. The woman isn™t terribly 

interested, and the hairdresser persists, until finally, this woman, just to shut hi m 

up, turns t o 
An
ne
 and says, what i s your name, my dear? And 
Anne
 says proudly, 
Anne Tyler Calabresi
. Woman almost goes t hrough the machine and says, related 
to Dr. 
Ma

? Said yes, he™s m y father-
in

signed his affidavit. She was a patron of 
Spoleto
, the festival, and had promised her 

grandchildren if they learned the language, t hat she woul d bring them to that 

country. And so she was there, bringing her granddaughter to 
Spoleto
 and so on, 
just by chance. And 
Anne
, of course, sa ys, I know exactly who you are, and tells 
her the story, because I had told 
Anne
 the story. 
Q: Of the 25,000 dollar check. 

A: Yeah, yeah. Which t his woman didn™t know. I mean, she didn™t know that this 

money, she thought Œ 

Q: Right.

A: My brother, who is much more on top of things, he is nine years old. I™m six, 
almost seven. 
Q: Young, yeah. 

A: I turned seven October 18, and he was born on April fifth, so he had turned ni ne 

on April fifth, and who knew enough about thi ngs so that when we get off the ship, 

he is on one side of a plank and says, I™m i n 
Italy
, because it™s Ital ian ter Œ the

America

Q: 
Italy
,
 
America
,
 Italy
,
 
America
.  
A: He is lucky, because this rinky- dink school had a class for non-English speaking 
children. So he finds hi mself, he™s in fourth grade, in a class wi
th many German;  
some French, who knows why; Spanish, which of course, we can converse with, 

children. And so he is immediately at home, in his proper grade, and because of 
that, first learns English perfectl y. The teacher is there to teach them American, h
e 
speaks good Ameri can, no accent of any sort, but just wonderful, and his Œ no one 
could sa y he was not born here. I, i nstead, am too young to go i nto that class. I 

should be in second grade, I get put in kindergarten, because I don™t  speak English. 

We sp
oke German and French. We™d had a German governess and a French 
governess, and so we both spoke German and French, we did not speak English. 

On the ship, my mother tried to teach me, and I didn™t want to, I was having too 
much fun. Once she catches me, and it is t he source of what is a true statement t hat 
I said, when I came to 
America
 I knew three words of English, yes, no and 
briefcase. Briefcase because she had this book that her governess had used to teach 

her English, and all these children were goi ng to school carrying satchels, and I 

said, what™s that, and she said briefcase. I liked the sound of it, so I remembered Œ I 

didn™t want  
[indeciphera ble]
. So yes, no and briefcase. 
Q: Briefcase.

A: So I get back, but in kindergarten. And Œ  
Q: It™s apropos for a lawyer, you know? 

A: Not bad. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I was doing, in 
Italy
, math at a fifth grade level, already. What t hese children 
are doing in kindergarten are just tyi ng Œ making necklaces and tying things. So I 

bring it up to the teacher, and she clearly is not pleased wi th it, so I do it again. 

She™s still not pleased with it. This goes on all  morning, or da y, or whatever. I 

come back t he hotel and I sa y to m y mot her in Italian, 
cosa vuol dire
, what does it 

mean, pull tighter? 

Q: Pull ti ghter. 

A: So I believe that  I was teased mercilessly. 
Q: Oh. 
A: I sa y that Œ I bl ocked a good deal of that, but I say that because when we went to 

Italy 
on sabbatical, and our daught er 
Bianca
 was three years old, our ancient 

nanny had come back t o look after the chil dren, and took her to the park across the 

way from where we were. And our three year old, who was very durable, runs up to 

some little children who were pla yi ng, and I kind of follow in the back, to see 

what™s goi ng on, t o two little girls who are pl ayi ng, and sa ys something in English.

And the y don™t understand, and pick up their things, and go awa y. And I don™t 
know that 
Bianca
 was particularly upset. I mean, she moved down to something 
else, was just I raced back to the house, and realized how I was reli vi ng a difficult 

kind of experience. One introducti on to 
America
, we get brought  to t his school, 

and teachers in 
Italy
, no matter, you know, how old or young, alwa ys wore black,

 is a big, blousy New Yorker, with all sorts of colored Œ

A: Œ

 and things. And I l ater learned that m y mot her came back 
and said to m y father, I don™t really understand this country, but  I™m afraid that

and Œ and t hen, how do I Œ what do I eat? Fortunately, when we have enough 
money so that we don™t have to rely just on the food of this Œ 
Q: Ten dollar a month place. 

A: Œ 10 dollar a month thing, w
ediscover the automats. Whichwere these 

wonderful 1930 things, all chrome and shiny and things and you put i n 10 cents, 

and you got somet hing. And this was fun for kids. And I discover chicken pot pie, 

which I thought was edible. And I survive on chicken pot pie and t he nickel and the 

wonderful thing of it. And my parents, bl ess them, are Œ understand, you know, the

needs, and I™ll show you how much the y did. My brother comes home Œ we arrive 
wearing litt le tweed coats, fur coats. Winter things in 
Italy
, and we thought of 
America
 that way, so you know, nicely, wonderfull y elegant. My brother comes 

home and sa ys, I cannot wear this. My mother said Œ no one is wearing it, just, I 

cannot wear anything like this. My mother sa ys, oka y. Wi th no money t hat we 
have, she understands that this chi ld is Œ and so we go to some five and dime 
someplace, to look for something. And she looks at all sorts of parka and things, 

she said, they™re all wearing parkas. And t he Œ whatever, and we look, which fairly 

costly, and good l ooking. And he said no, no, no, no. And he then sees something 

which is a quite ugly, black and green kind of pressed something or other thing, 

which is very cheap, and he sa ys, that™s what everybody™s wearing. And m y mot her 

says, oka y, and buys it for him. Turns to me and sa ys, do you want one? And I said, 
not on your life. I mean, I™m not fitting in Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ anyway, and so on. And Œ 

Q: But he was. 

A: What?

A: He was.

Q: Yeah. 
A: He was. And Œ and t hat made hi m, in some ways, more American. He remained 

v ery 
Œ he was Œ you know, he was my idol. He was a wonderful person. He Œ he 

just made m y life. But he did fit in more. I Œ I didn™t, and I learned English there 

and at home from my mother, which is why I had the sli ght accent. 
Q: Autumn apples? 
A: But, I do have a slight accent. Somehow, you know, we survi ve, and come 

January, we go to 
New Haven
.  
Q: I wanted to ask t his question before I forgot. How old were your parents in 

1939, when you arrived? 

A: My father was born in 1903, he was 36. 

Q: So he was relati vely young. 
A: Yes. 
Q:Oka y. And your mother?
 
A: And m y mother was a year older. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Thirty-seven. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
102
 
A: And m y father, by t he way, had Œ and this became a problem Œ he had been an 
associate professor. In 1936, 
very, v
ery young for Italian, he had writ ten a book on 
cardiology, one of the founding books on ki Œ electroca-cardi ographs, and things, 

which had won the gold medal for the best  sci entific book of the year. And there 

was a competition for a full professorship. His chief was part of the commission, 
and had the other two votes, the commissi oners, five, to put him in. But said, I™m 
going to be here next year as well, with the same committee, and there™s somebody 

senior to you. If I put you in this year, thi s other g
uywill never makeit. Will 
Œ do 
you mind being put off for a year? My father said, of course not. The next year the 

fascists were strong enough so that the y could block it. Whether it  was that he 

wouldn™t take a loyalty oath, or something, I don™t know. But the next year, when 

he should have gone through, he didn™t. With t he result that we came before he be Œ 
was a tenured, full professor. 
Q: Would t hat have made a difference? 

A: That would have made ma ybe some difference here. It certainly would have 

mad e
 a difference after the war, in terms of 
Italy
. But it certainly made life more 
difficult, because he di dn™t have a title. And, you know, when I was offered, 

extremely young, a full  professorship at 
Chicago
, in my first year of teaching, and 

decided to t urn it down, because I wanted to stay at 
Yale
, wellthe y couldn™t

promote me i mmediatel y, I told the dean, I know it™s all right, but you must 
understand that psychologically it™s more difficult for me. And he did some 

wonderful things about comforting me in t his. And then I became a full professor 

in a year or t wo later, very, very young sti ll, but it was part of, again Œ 

Q: Well,it was 
Œ it  was part of Œ 
A: Œ of the history. 

Q: Yeah, of the hist ory.  

A: Yeah, part of that. So, in January, we come to 
New Hav
en
, to be Œ  for this 
fellowship. Now first Œ I didn™t know it at  the time, and m y parent s never told me, 

but recently, a dean of a medical school found the letter from the head of the 

internal medicine, t o my father, tell ing hi m his fellowship was there, and he could 

come on such and such a ti me, and what it was. And sent me thi s lett er. A copy of 
this letter. 
Q: When you sa y recently, in the past few years or so? 

A: What?
 
Q: When you sa y recently, do you mean in the past few years? 

A: Yeah, about three, four years ago. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
104
 
A: Well,now ma ybe 
Œ you know, could now be 10. But was at some point a dean 
found it in the files and sent it to me, but just Œ 
Q: Decades after the event. 

A: Œ decades Œ decades after. It™s the most insulting letter you can i magine. 

Q: What di d it say? 
A: It said, somebody has given us mone y to give you a fellowshi p, and so we™re 
doing it. Try to get  them t o give us more money. Don™t think that you™ll be able to 

stay more t han this time, and don™t  think you can do this, this, this or this. You™ve 

been given this fellowship, we™ve been given the mone y, but essential ly said, we 

don™t really like people like you. 

Q: So the welcome mat was really put out. 

A: Yeah. Understand t hat this was a 
Yale
 that at this ti me had never had either a 
Catholic or a Jewish full professor in 
Yale 
col lege. It wasn™t until  1946 that 
Yal e
 
had a Catholic or full professor Œ or Jewish full professor in 
Yale 
college. 
Harvard
 
wasn™t much before that, it was when 
Cona nt
 became president, which is one of 
the reasons 
Harvard 
got so far ahead of 
Yale
, because 
Conant 
became president 
before the war, and so all the refugees coul d go to 
Harvard
. 
Schumpeter
, the 
great economist, wanted to come to 
Yale
, but couldn™
t, had to go to 
Harvard
. He 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
105
 
had many friends among the economists at  
Yale
, but this was 
Yal e 
col lege. The 
law school was different, and had been different forever Œ 

Q: At 
Yale
. 
A: Œ 
toits glory. At 
Yale
. It had a Jewish full professors, Catholic professors, 
Catholic act ing dean, in the 19
th
 century admitted women. The law school was 
always the t roublemaker, which is why I love it, and alwa ys different. The medical 

school, sli ghtly different. The dean of the medical school, 
Winternitz
, was Jewish. 

Some said very ant i-Semit ic, but he was Jewish. There were some Jews on the 

facult y. Still an enormous quota, I mean, you know. The first person i n the class 

was alwa ys Jewish, because to be Jewish, t o be admitted t o the medical school, you 

had to be Œ but Œ but at least it was mildly open, but Œ but just barely, in the 

me
dical school. And apart from the dean, I don™t know that there were any full 
professors who were Jewish, but anywa y.  

Q: Is this where your father was attached? 

A: This was where m y father was attached, the fellowship was to the medical 

school. The person he was worki ng with, 
Arthur Geiger
, who was in cardiology, 
was Jewish, was not a full professor, was an associate professor. But Œ so it™s not  

surprising that this letter, that a previous president of 
Yale
, who had just left a few 

years before, 
James Rowlan
d Angell
, was a fascist and worse. I mean, he actual ly 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
106
 
wrote a letter sa ying, if there could be something like what happened to the 
Armenians in 
New Haven
 and 
Bridgeport
, we might be able to save our Nordic 
heritage. This was not uncommon, with 
Lowell
 at 
Harvard
, and 
Butler
 at 
Columbia
. You know, it was the way people thought at t hat ti me. So I sa y, the law 

school was different, we had nothi ng to do with the medical school, was slightly 
different, and so on. That™s where my father, because a fellowship had Œ mone y 
had been given to t hem, and ma ybe the 
Dazien
(ph) foundation was doing this 

because the y wanted to open it. Who knows why they gave it here. But Œ so, we 

arrive. And the real estate agent comes to try t o find us a place to rent, a little house 

to rent, and immediately shows us places on 
Worcester 
square, which was where 
the Italians lived, or in 
Westville
, where the Jews lived. And we get shown places 
there, and the people from the medical school kind of sweep in, and say no. What  
the y essenti ally said, you are ethnically 
Yale
. 
Q: There™s a new ethni cit y, it™s called 
Yale
? 

A: It wasn™t ethnic, 
I mean,
 you live between 
Whitney
 Avenue and 
Orange 
St reet, 
between the park and 
Edwa rd
 Street, because that™s where all the fell ows, assistant 
professors, young
 
Yale 
facult y live. And so they found us a nice l ittle house, stil l 
there, in that area. An area, by the wa y, whi ch is still toda y full of 
Yale 
fellows, 

assistant professors and so on. Now, ethnically of every ethnicity, but still remains 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
107
 
the place Œ the full professors lived across the street in bi gger houses, or here or 
there. But that was the area where young facult y members lived. Whi ch is perfectly 

fine 
[indecipherable]
 t hey said, you know, thi s is what you are. Now imagine we 
arrive there, everybody who is there, is a 
W ASP
. We have in comm on with them 
that they are faculty and academic, but ethnically, cultural ly, extraordinarily little. 
Q: Well, you know, one of the Œ 
A: And, if you look then to the Jewish community, we had al most not hing to do 

with people who were wonderful, mainly Ashkenazi m. Couldn™t believe that we 

were Jewish, that m y father, particularly the Œ he took, when he woul d see them, 

the medical school and so on, as patients, to speaking to them in German, because 

then the y thought, oh then ma ybe this person sp Œ speaks an odd dialect of Yiddish. 

To convince them t hat actually Œ you know, because Œ and the Itali an community, 
almost all southern; very, very poor. 
Q: Southern 
Italy
. 
A: Southern 
Italy
. A-Again, very little to do with this. Now, with one odd 
exception. There were a few left wing anti-fascists who had been ostracized by the 

community because the fascists had pla yed very much this Œ 
you must be more 
fascist than the fascists if you™re here and so on. And these people, when the y heard 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

108
 
that m y father had arrived, knowing about hi m and his ant i-fascism, were so 
thrilled at having somebody who was a Œ 

Q: Kindred spirit. 

A: Œ and a kindred spirit and cultivated, that several of them made hi m executor of 

their wills, even though he was a doctor and knew nothing about l aw. And there 
was a barber named 
Malefronte
(ph). I Œ I remember, I just met somebody who was 
the granddaughter of this barber™s partner, and said, you know, I think that Œ 
so it 
Œ 
and m y parents got  very much involved in the doing things for the Italian 
community. But we were part of, in a wa y, not hing. My mother became the first 

Italian member ever, of something called t he 
Cerco l™Ital iano
, which was a group 
of elderl y Yankee women who read 
Dante
 and other things. But they™d never had 

an Italian having Œ for friend, that the y should. 
Q: I want t o make a comment here, is that Œ  
A: I™m sorry? 

Q: I want t o make a comment, because that  was Œ it Œ it™s one of the changes, or Œ 

you come from a famil y t hat has been integrat ed in 
Italy
 for two mill ennia. People 
know who you are. You know who you are, because you can trace i t from the 

slaves Œ 

A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: Œ who came from 
Titus
, you know?And y 
Œ when you sa y your name in 
Italy
, 
people have a sense of who is thi s person. 
A: Immediately. Immediately. 

Q: And you come to this world Œ 

A: Even Œ even before the garden, or before anyt hing. I mean, the y all know who 
we are.
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: We are who we are. We arrive here and we are outsiders, unknown, and Œ 

Q: Without any mooring, in some wa ys. 

A: Œ without any mooring, and Œ  

Q: How does this affect your fami ly? How does it affect your Œ the older Œ your 

parents, and then you and your Œ 
A: In Œ in an odd wa y, we Œ we know we are outsiders, and that we are ourselves, 
and that we will take the best that there is, and give the best that we can, to all of 

these, but we don™t bel ong. 

Q: You know you don™t belong. 

A: We don™t belong. And that™s one of the things, when I said why we don™t go 

back. Somehow m y brother and I know we are outsiders, and ki nd of relish it.

Q: So, in other words, when you would be going back to 
Italy
, you would be 
belonging again. 
A: We would belonging. We™d i mmediately fit in. When I studied in 
England
, the 
end of two years, they offered me a fellowshi p, which would have been the end of a 

career, having a fellowship at 
Magdalen 
Coll ege, that™s it, in economics, perfect. I 
didn™t want  to take that, problems with economics, but partly because I would 
immediately fit in a category of society, and Œ there, and I said, if I wanted to fit 
somewhere, I™d go back to 
Italy
, you know? There, the moment I™m there, 
Anne
 
says I melt into the woodwork when I go over. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. I mean, it j ust i s. I am. Everybody knows who I am. In an odd kind of way, 

it™s a small country. Everybody knows. When we went to 
Rome
 on sabbatical, we 
went to 
Rome
 
because thereweren™t many 
Œ  
m y great
-aunt and great-uncle were 
there, but the y were m uch older, and we want ed to make our own friends, and so 

on. We made friends, and we found, inevitabl y, that the people we li ked were 

people whose grandparents were on the same side of this fight or that  with m y 

grandparent s, and you know, it Œ it™s that  kind of a country. Well here, we were 

nothing. 

Q: Well, this is an experie Œ

A: And one Œ 
Q: Oka y, I™m sorry I™m interrupting, but I want to make another point  with this. Is 

this is often the experience of the exile. You know, sort of like the 20
th
 century 
phenomena, the 20
th
 century experi ence Œ 
A: That™s ri ght. 
Q: Œ of someone who was somebody. 
A: And now Œ 

Q: The y™re nobody. 

A: Yeah. And Œ and there™s some funny things about this. When m y brother 

married 
Celi a
, who as I sa y, was my classmate in element ary school, because I 

won a fellow Œ a scholarship to a little pri vate school here, and she was in that 

clas
s. My t hen coll ege roommate, who was from 
New Haven
, and so on, said, oh, I 
am so 
Œ m y parent s are so glad. And I sai d, why would t he y care? I mean, what 
they Œ and he said, because people ask them who your roommat e is at 
Yale
, and Œ 

we had three roommates Œ and I Œ and I tel l them, somebody named 
G uido  

Calabresi
, and m y parents™ friends, business types, said, who are they? And now 

m y parents can sa y, oh, he is married to these people. So, to them, thi s was a way 

of saying, there is now Œ 

Q: So now you™re somebody. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
112
 
A: He™s somebody. And now, I don™t know the extent to which both my brother 
and I Œ 
and maybe m y parents,but mybrotherandI,have wanted, unconsciously to 

rebuild here, what we had there. Somebody has seen the farm where I live, which is 

v ery b
eautiful, which we got Œ 
Q: Here, in Œ in 
Connecticut
.  
A: Œ somewhere here, i n 
Woodbridge
, yeah. And 
Œ and it™s a beautiful place. We 
got it for al most nothing when we were first married, but i t was Œ it™s a huge 

number Œ amount of land, and an 18
th
 cent ur
y house,and it™sbeen made 
Œ we™ve 
worked at it , and it™s reall y beautiful. And somebody who was st udying at the law 

school, who is a writer, wrote a book in which he said, thi s house, whi ch looks like 

a villa in 
Tusca ny
. And I said to hi m, you™re right and you™re wrong , it™s not in 
Tuscany
, and it™s outside of 
Bologna
. But it™s, in a wa y it™s rebui lding m y 
grandparent s™ villa outside there. So there i s some side of people li ke me, who must 

rebuild and reestablish, so that now, you know, I™m an outsider in some wa ys, and 

yet, people know me and our chil dren and Œ and Œ  

Q: Do you still feel an outsider? 

A: Yes. And in some ways, I really still am. It™s a funny business. I teach a course 

with a judge on our court, who is a good friend, who was chief judge. H
e™s younger 

than I am, and I teach a seminar wi th hi m. His name is 
J ohn Walker

Bush™s 
first cousin. And he is as much an insi der as you can i magine in that Œ 
some 
ways in his legal career and so on. And Œ and says that every once i n a  while I do 

things whi ch puzzle thi s guy.  

Q: He says that to you? 

A: No, I mean 
Anne
, m y wife 
Œ 
Q: Oh, your 
Anne
, yeah.
 
A: Œ sa ys that, and it™s clear that they puzzle him, because they are not what a 

Yankee American would do. He™s come to see us in 
Italy
, and when he™s come to 
see us, he now understands far more. When he, every once in a while, he does act Œ 

he™s a nice man, a friend, but he does act as if who Œ what is this guy doing? And at 

that point my wife, who is even more old, old, old, old Yankee than he is, kind of 

looks at hi m, to say, you keep your place, youngster. But  it is Œ it is there, and I 
think it is one of the thi ngs that has made me both useful and successful and open. 
Q: So the kind of outsi der that you™re ment ioning, it™s Œ 
i t™s far more subtl
e than 

discrimination. It is Œ 

A: Yes, it™s a much deeper thing. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: It™s a much deeper t hing. I mean, discri mination, were t here some? Yes, of 

course, there were. And it™s kind of interesting to see. I got Œ we went to the public 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

school that was right there, and it was a public school which then, as now, 
primarily have broader things, but  have many, many children of young 
Yale
, 

because of where it was. And Œ and the local Boy Scout troop i s the same way, you 

know, all these thi ngs were this Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ little kind of 
Yale WASP 
centered thing. At some point, the 
Foote
 school, 
which was a wonderful private school, made really wonderful by the fact Œ 
by one 
fact of discrimination, that 
Yale
 had no women teachers, so that many of the 

teachers
 in t his littl e private school were the wives of professors, and i mmensely 
learned, and interesti ng and so on. You know, you had a level of teachers that was 

fantastic. In seventh grade, I get a scholarship there. My parents are uncertain about 

private schools, because in 
Italy
 private schools were Œ but the fact that it was an 
all da y, and anywa y, the headmistress, who was English, and who was a wonderful 

lady, told t hem, this reall y is better level of education and so on. Why did I get that 

fellowship Œ that schol arship. Affirmative acti on, but not  because I was Jewish, not 

because I was Catholic, not because I was Itali an, even though I probably was 

about the only person, maybe one or two others Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
115
 
A: Œ of that. Was because I was a boy, and in seventh grade, enough boys went off 
to prep school awa y, that the y needed boys, and so the y looked t o this public 

school, and here was this kid. Because, when I came to 
New Haven
, I went back to 
second grade, I was doing things back at t he level, and clearly they Œ  

Q: Right. 
A: Œ and so that™s why I got the scholarship. I was there, in this school, which was 
all the really major professors. A classmat e of mi ne was 
Sally Griswold
, the 
daughter of a guy who became presi dent of 
Yale
, and we became, you know, very 

close friends. This was the whole entourage there, and lawyers, great lawyers, and 

so on. My wife was two years behind me i n school. And so, what happens? In those 

days, when you get  to high school, the mothers of daughters would have dances at  

Christ masti me, at vacat ion ti me, t o which proper, eligible people Œ 
boys 
Œ would be 
invited. It was just  the way it was, you know, you Œ a-and the y™d have dances in 

their homes, and things. It™s kind of interesting, some invited me, and some did not. 

As it happened, m y wife™s family i nvited me, because they were people who were 

not bigots, and the y were friends of the guy who became president of 
Yale
, and 

whose daughter was my friend, and of 
Gene Rostow
, who became t he first Œ not 
the first Jewish dean, but a Jewish dean of the law school. And Œ you know, the y 

knew, and they knew, in a wa y, who we were. There were people who were very 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
116
 
open, and people who were less so. I can™t say I really noticed or cared, because 
our attitude, in a wa y, was very snobbish. 

Q: Your own in turn Œ 

A: My family. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Yeah, I mean, you know, we thought, we were who we were when you people 
were painting yourselves blue. 

Q: Well, you know, there™s some truth to t hat. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And Œ and there™s al so Œ 

A: And Œ and so but, in a way, 
we were 
Œ 
an
-and the fact that we didn™t belong, 
meant that we woul d be friends with everybody, but in some wa ys we also thought 
that we were outsiders because we were better than everybody. Which isn™t nice. 
But it is part of, at the same ti me, a feeling t hat  we had to achieve, because if 

anyt hing happened to my father and mother, there we were, at least until after the 

war, and not i mmediately after the war, but when things started getting put back 

together agai n. 

Q: I want t o dwell on t his a little bit before it™s Œ sort of like psychology. In some 

ways also, I Œ I Œ I take your point where you™re sa ying that, you know, we thought 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
117
 
we were a little bit bett er than others. You have a certainly illustri ous family 
history, that can be very convincing to Œ t o feed that. At the same time, when 

you™re in the positi on of an exile and a refugee Œ 

A: And you feel both Œ 

Q: Œ too many other people didn™t have those reserves and suffered enormously, 
internally Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ because the y didn™t have Œ the y felt like they no longer mattered in the world. 
A: But it Œ it Œ and you know, the odd thi ng is, if you are t hat way, you Œ it really 

doesn™t mat ter. I mean, we had a Œ m y parents had a very, very hard time making it 

here. Ulti mately the y did. Ulti mat ely m y father became a full professor. Ultimately 

the y were recognized i n their fields, but t he y had a very, very hard ti me. And I 
someti mes thought we were outsiders and felt like this, because the y were having a 
hard ti me. I don™t think that™s true, and m y example of that is 
Hanna
 Gray
, who 
became president Œ provost at 
Yal e
, presi dent of 
Chicago
. Wasa coupleof years 

ahead of me, at this same school. Oh, by the way, this English headmi stress was 

delighted that she had people who were Italian Jewish, and so on, because she was 

somebody who wanted that, and so on. When 
Ha nna
 was provost, and we were 
friends, because of Œ 
they were 
at dinner Œ lunch at our house once, and I said Œ we 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
118
 
were talking about t he experience coming, and I said, but of course, i t was very 
different for you, because her mother was Jewi sh, her father was a great German 

historian, whosechair at 
Heidelberg
 was pai d for by the 
Rockefeller
, had been 
given by the 
Rockefell er 
in 1930s. Because his wife was Jewish, the y decided to 

leave, and 
Rockefell er 
found Œ 
whetherit was the 
Rockefellers
 or a foundation, 
said to American universities, whichever one of you wants 
[indecipherable]
 
Hajo 

Holborn
 was his name, we will give the chair Œ move the chair there. And he 
wasn™t Jewish, so 
Yale
 was perfectly willing to have hi m an-and it was a great, 
great story, and so t he chair was here, and the Œ and so I said to 
Hanna
, I expect 
your experience was very different from ours, because you came, and your father 

was a full professor already, with his chair and that, so on, and Œ and she looked at 

me, and she said, you™re absolutely wrong. And she described her feel ings, and her 
family™s feelings of bei ng outsiders, in exactly the same way. Because it was that  
just this sense of there you were somebody, here you are nobody. And this is Œ it™s 

odd. 
Bob Dahl
, the great political scientist , wrote a book called ﬁ
Who Governs
?ﬂ 
in which one of the things that he does, i s talk about who are the soci al elite, the 

political elit e, the financial elite, the academi c elite in a town. And in 
New Haven
, 
he defines these in good political scientist  terms 
[indecipherable]
. Financial elite, 
anybody who is on the board of directors of any one of different companies. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
119
 
Political eli te, anybody who is 
[i ndecipherable]
 certain positions
, sel ect man
, or 
whatever, or select men in towns and Œ and things of that sort. Fine Œ social elite, 
anybody who goes to what used to be the debutante ball in 
New Haven
, a big 

dance. And academic elite, anybody who™s full professor. Finds only one person 

who is all four. Me. The outsider. Nice irony. Why all four? Well, academic elite, 
easy. Polit ical elite, at some point the town of 
Woodbri dge
 wants to ask me to run 
as a 
Œ for select man. Democrats don™t win, but there is minority representation, you 

have to have a certain number of things. I™m not particularly interested, I™m sa yi ng 

I™m in 
Euro pe
 on sabbatical, but if you put my name down, they need a name. 
There are Itali an Americans living in 
Woodbridge
 who always vote republic, 

because the Irish are democratic. The y know an Italian name, vote for it. Why 

didn™t the democrats do that before? Because if you do that, all t he 
Yale 
people, 
and the Jewish psychiatrists and so on, wouldn™t vote for that one. For me, of 
course, they all vote. So, easy, I somehow get elected and spend some years doing 

that. Financial elite, they™re looking for somebody, two parts of a bank are fighting 

with each ot her. The y™ve never had an Italian on the bank. Compromise, let™s not 

fight, let™s put somebody who™s totally an outsider on the bank. So I end up being a 

bank director, because I was a full professor, young and It alian, ever l ooking for a 

bank. And social el ite, yeah. All the people who get asked by girls who are comi ng 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

out, to be t heir escorts, then get asked to this dance. And since m y friends in school 
were the ones who were Œ so Œ and yet I™m an outsider in all of them. 

Q: And you still feel that, that™s the ke y thing Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ is that  you st ill feel that. 
A: Yes. And when my son, our children were growing up, at some point I was 
sayi ng to 
Massimo
, our youngest, how hi s older sisters, who seem to be so 
successful, and this was this younger kid, and the first Œ the only guy with these 

two very powerful sisters. And so I said t o him, you know, the y Œ  that, you have 

insecurities, but realize that your sisters each have insecurit ies, and I started talking 

about their insecurit ies, and he understood. And then, being a bright li ttle boy, he 

turned to me, and he said, and what are your i nsecurities, Daddy? And I 
immediately said,I™m a
 refugee. I™m a refugee. I™m an outsider. And I Œ by the 
way, I sa y being a refugee is the most i mportant part of my legal education, 

because it shows me what it means to be an outsider, which is very important if 

you™re gonna be a lawyer and a judge. S
ay,
 I™m a refugee. And he immediately 
says, of course, of course. And so is Uncl e 
Paul
, only he deals with it  in a different 
way from you. 

Q: What a smart boy. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
121
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: How old was he? 

A: But he™s so Œ he must have been 13 Œ 12, 13. 

Q: But truly a smart Œ you know, very insight ful. 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he saw when I said that, that of course, t here are all sort s 
of things that I stil l feel outside, and so di d 
Paul
, but that we deal t with it in 
different wa ys 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Well, you know, of all the things we™ve talked about, the identities; born Jewish, 

baptized, and now a practicing Cat holic. It alian, refugee, outsider. Which of them 

has predominance? 

A: Different ones at different times, you know? In an odd wa y, I have both felt 

being outsi der because of each of these Œ 
Q: Easily. 
A: Œ at different times. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And also, I have used each of these. For instance, when I was dean, to reach out 

to different groups, because I saw my parents, though they had nothing directly in 

common, reaching out to help people in the Jewish community, help people in t he 

Italian community. My mother was a Knight of the Italian Republic after the war, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
122
 
for all she had done for Italian Americans here. Reaching out to t he academic 
community, reaching out to all of these, and gi ving to them of that, so that you feel 

both apart and outside, but a duty to do something for 
[indecipherable]
. It helped, 
you know. When I was dean, there were all sorts of people who are It alian 

Americans, who are Jews, who are this, who are that, who are the other. And the y™d 
see a dean who was also that. 
Q: And so they Œ l ike many black girls now say.  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And why 
Obama 
was so important to the black community. If he can, so can I. 

A: There™s a Œ there™s a man, 
Iacobucci
, who beca
me a justice of the Canadian 
supreme court, dean of the law school at 
Toronto
, and act ing president of the 

University of 
Toronto
. The first ti me I met hi m, he said to me, 
Guido
, you don™t 
know how much you meant to me. I said, why? And he said, I was a you ng kid at 

the univer Œ  at law school in 
Toronto
, and I came home one day, I loved law, and I 

said to my parents, I want to be a 
[indeci phera ble]
. And they said, you can™t. And 
I said why?  And he Œ his parent sai d, because you™re an Italian and in 
Canada
 
an
d 
Toronto Œ
 then. 
Toronto 
is very different now, but then, you know, that can™t be. I 
took out of m y pocket, an article in the ﬁ
New York Times
,ﬂ how 
Guido Calabresi
 

had become the youngest full professor of the history of a 
Yale 
l aw school, and t wo

or three youngest i n the history of 
Yale
. I said, if that can happen t o an Italian at 
Yale
, it can happen here. So, you are, you know. If you know that all of these 

things can be of use to others, you then rel ish every one of these feelings of being a 

Œ 

Q: Of this identity, or that identity, or Œ what would you like us to understand about 
what it is t o be a refugee? That is both hist orical a question, and I think very 
currently a question. 

A: The first thing i s that every refugee is an outsider. And that™s t he fundamental  

thing. The second is that it has alwa ys been the case that there have been people 

who helped, and I can t ell you, and when I was sworn in, I n-named t hem by name. 

Ziegler Sargent
 of the 
Sa rg ent
 lock company, who went  out of his way t o help 
these little Italian boys Œ 
became a 
Œ  a very good friend of m y parents, as a result. 
And there are people who stand in your way
. And 
Œ 
but if you worryaboutthe 
people who stand i n your wa y, you hurt yourself. But if you inst ead are grateful for 
those who help, and then help others in your situation, that makes you something 

that makes this country better. You Œ 

Q: One Œ mm-hm? One of the things that you said about what your parents had 

done, and I want to ask more questions about what some of their difficulties were, 

was that the y engaged. Very often when 
a 
refugee will come to a for Œ very often, 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
124
 
when a refugee will come to a foreign country, the y feel so strange and so much 
and outsider, and so Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ different, that the y will close in on their own communities. 

A: Oka y, t his is very i mportant, and it™s a great piece of luck. Because of this 
fellowship at 
Yale
, and because we were able to hang on and sta y here, we were 
not part of the Italian refugee community that was centered in 
New York
.  We 

knew them, or some, in 
Boston
, a few different places, eit her of anti-fascists, or of 

Jews. We knew them, we were a part of them, we had been with them. We would 

see them from ti me to t ime, so that I went to call on the mother of the 
Rosselli
 

brothers, who had been Œ who was living Œ  

Q: Sure. 
A: Œ in 
Larchmonts
(ph), because t hat, you know, we di d, but Œ but we were not 
part of it, and so we di d not close in, in the way such a communi ty does. You s Œ 
those peopl e al most all went back, remained somet hing to themsel ves, because it 

was much easier than dealing with this strange, American world. Because we were 

here, and alone, we couldn™t do that. I™ve seen that in other wa ys. I have a law 

clerk, who is now dean of a law faculty at 
Cornell
, named 
Eduardo Peñalver
, 
whose f ami ly fled 
Cuba
. His father did not want to stay either in 
Florida
, or in

New Jersey
 where the mai n Cuban Œ went to 
Washington
 State, doctor Œ that 
family 
Œ these people are brilliant, wonderful, have done al l sorts of things. The y™re 
much more open,becau
se the y had to deal  wi th the rest of the world, and weren™t  

able to look in on t hemselves, and on their troubles, and on their grievances, whi ch 

are real. As we could have, had we been part of that little 
New York
 community. 
So that was somet hing which I don™t think m y parents were especial ly aware. I 
think the y underst ood afterwards, that they were doing things which might be hard, 

but that they were much more interesting t han had the y been part of that 

community. 

Q: Tell me a little bit about how i t was t hat your father was able to hang on after 

that unwelcome letter. 

A: Yeah, so first, you know, you come to 
New Haven
, you come to t his little house 
on 
Willow
 Street, which is still t here. It was the old farmhouse for that area. Nice 
little house, wooden, ve
ry si mple.
 
Q: Different than 
Milan
. 

A: What?
 
Q: Different than 
Milan
. 

A: Slightly different. They still had an icebox in those days, and a Œ t he 
Hygienic

month, even, the wife of a distinguished professor comes t o call on my mother, 
because in those da ys 
Yale
 was small enough so that new facult y member Œ and 
fellows were considered fac
ult y members 
Œ gets called on by the wife Œ alwa ys t he 

wife, because it was Œ t he wife calls on the wife, the senior faculty member in some 

other depart ment. I™m home from school, and I™m pla ying Œ sort  of myself, cars or 
something, and my mot her is giving this lady t ea. And this lady asks her how she 
likes 
Ameri ca
, and m y mother says, oh, it™s very nice. And then t he person, 
looking to make conversation sa ys, and what do you thi nk of the plumbing? I 

understand that she means, isn™t it wonderful to have indoor plumbing, because she 

thinks of Italians as people who don™t. My mother doesn™t understand. She just 

doesn™t understand. Then, she thinks she understands, and she says, of course, it™s 

very si mple Œ compared to a marble bathroom, the sort of thing which is absolutely 
normal in 
Milan
, and t hing. But after all, what should one expect? And I can tell 
that she™s t hinking, at least you don™t have Indians firing at us. She™s j ust as 
provincial i n her wa y as the other one is in a way. And I don™t Œ  I, instead, already 

understand what each one of them is 
[indecipherable]
 
say.
 
Q:Oh m y God.
 

A: Because I™ve been i n school, you know. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

Q: This is sort of like when you speak English and you speak English, and you 
need a transl ator in bet ween. 

A: That™s ri ght. And I never tell my mother this, because she would have been 

upset, because she didn™t want to be Œ 
sa y some
thing rude, but it was. Neither 

understood the other, and it was perfectl y fine. So that™s how we are as insider 
outsiders. My father is at the medical school, and has this extraordinarily dreadful 
accent, because of whi ch it™s very hard to understand hi m. He knows the language 

very well, and he is hanging on by his fingernails.  

Q: Oh, poor man. 

A: He is a great Œ he™s a great doctor as wel l as scientist. He never writes the kinds 

of things here, and does the kind of research here that he was doing in 
Italy
, which, 
you know, people said this was 
No bel
 prize type of stuff. But never does that here. 
But he comes to be loved by students because of what he does. But he is certainly 

not Œ he™s at the fringes, and not appreciated in any wa y at all. My mother Œ oh, 

they decide that if you™re going to Œ if we™re going to sta y here, it would be useful 

to have American degrees. So m y father, because of the chairman of public health,

it out so you get a doct orate. And so my father gets a doct orate in public health, 
with his left hand, thanks to this guy. It™s only Œ 
remains onlyahobby. My mother 

instead, whose field in 
Italy
 was philosophy of art 
[indecipherable]
 i s her 
dissertation, so decides to go to graduate school at 
Yale
. She starts out teaching at 

what is now 
So uthern
 
Co nnecticut
, it was 
Teacher™s College
 at t he time, to earn 
some money while
 we™re here. She gets fired i n 1941, when 
America
 goes in the 
war, because suddenly people decide Œ realize that you™re supposed to be a citizen 

to teach in a state college. And everybody™s desperate, but there™s nothing to be 

done about it. And anyway, she goes and 
she t eaches 
Œ she decides that she™s gonna 
get a degree in French, because a French Œ 
German
-French depart ment,
 Henri 
Peyre
, was a brilliant, interesting scholar, and she™d always been interested in 
linguistics and literature. So she gets a doctorate in French. And Œ and that becomes 
her field. The head of the French department wants her appointed to the 
Yale 
College faculty. It is said, and I can™t prove it, that it goes all the wa y to the 

corporation, which says no. We have no women teachers Œ no women students in 

the college, how can we have women teachers? Logic on logic. So she goes and 

teaches at 
Co nnecti cut 
College in 
New London
, then 
Co nnecti cut 
College for 
Women. Int eresting story about marriage and t hings. I sa y to my mother years later, 

when my mother sa ys, you know, I™d wanted t o do two things i n my life. Three

things. Teach, write and look after m y family. Because I wasn™t in a research 
university, I could only do two at a time, and she taught and looked after her 

family. When she retired Œ actually, after the war, she Œ 
Yale 
is sti ll closed to her, 

she moves from 
Connecticut 
College, to 
Albertus Magnus
, a Cathol ic college 
here, because it™s right nearby, and it™s not as fancy. We don™t need it as a backup 
any more, but she conti nues to teach. When she retires, she starts t o write, and she 
writes Œ well, a book that she wrote in French. We found a letter from the head of 

the 
École
 
de France
 when she died suddenly i n 
Italy
, sa ying from now on 
Reyna ud
(ph) scholarship begins with you, so she was able to do that . But I asked 
her why they didn™t  both leave and go to a research university. And I said, is it 

because in those da ys, women followed men? And Papa was here, and he wanted to 

stay here. And she laughed and she said, oh no. What happened was t hat when this 
happened, your father was furious, and wanted to leave.  
Q: When the y didn™t accept her at 
Yale
. 

A: At 
Yale
. Wanted to leave and tri ed both to go to research universit ies. And she 
said, but I wouldn™t let hi m. And I said, why? And she said, I wouldn™t let hi m 

because here he was hanging on by his fingernails, and despite his accent, people 

were beginning to appreciate him. Not as t he scholar he was, but as a teacher, as 
a 

clinician, as a wonderful clinician. And here I thought he would ulti mat ely make it.

I thought if we went someplace else, he wouldn™t. And I knew that I was the 
stronger, and the more flexible, and that I coul d deal with it. And she was a brilliant 

woman
, and could. Her way of teaching is more like mi
ne than m y dad™s.My mom 
Œ it gets complicated, but you Œ and I said well, but how did you keep them, if Œ 

you know, as a mat ter of principle, and she smil ed and she said, I made a scene. 
Andwhen my mot her m
ade a scene, it was a scene. And she said, I said to him, 
Massimo
, you made meleave 
Italy
 in a matter of principle, and I left m y family, 
m y friends, and everybody. And you were right. But it was very costl y. Now, I™m 
beginning to make friends here Œ she coul dn™t have cared less, oka y Œ 
and you want 

us to leave again, on a matter of principle. This one™s on me. We sta y. What coul d 

he do? And then she looked at me quite fiercel y, and she said, but  you must never 

tell hi m. Oka y, my mot her dies suddenly Œ 
Q: 
What year?
 
A: Œ in 
Italy
. She was almost 80. My father was giving some lectures, she had gone 
there, she had tea with a friend, and her friend said, you look happy. She said, it 
was easy to be happy if you™re fortunate in your daughters-in-law, has a heart 

attack and dies. My father is upset and doesn™t want to talk about her for months. 

Then finally, one evening I™m having dinner with him Œ he survi ves her by about 

five years, six years. He says to me, you know, your mother was a great lady. And I

said yes
. And he says, no, I don™t think you know. And I sa y oh? He said, you 
know, when she couldn™t get an appoint ment at 
Yale
, I wanted to leave. And I said, 

oh? And he said, but she wouldn™t let me. And I said, oh? And he said, she said 

[indecipherable]
 and I said, oh? And then he looked at me and he sai d, all 

nonsense. She knew she was the stronger one, and she never told me. And Œ  
Q: Oh. Oh. How beauti ful. 
A: Well, and think about a marriage between t wo people, who in many ways could 

not have been more different. I mean, he was t otally anti-religion, Jewish, no, no, 

that was hi s background, but never set foot in the synagogue. She had become 

Catholic, which he didn™t like, wi th Œ all sorts of different fields, different things. 

Could argue about everyt hing, and did. But ult imately Œ  

Q: There™s also a lot of wisdom and dept h, t Œ for both to see these thi ngs about t he 
other. 
A: Yeah, 
yeah, yeah,
 absolutely. And that™s al l part of being this kind of outsider. 
Now, you know, you were outsiders, and t hen there were occasional  little things 

which were not. When my mother comes t o pi ck me up the first few day Œ the first 

day or so t hat I™ve gone to 
Worthington Hooker
, this public school, just a few 

blocks from where we were living, she arrives and she sees a whole group of kids 

around me, sort of singing something and sayi ng something, and said oh dear,

they™re teasi ng 
Gui do
 again. But when she gets near, she hears wh-what the y™re 
sayi ng is 
Guido 
has a girlfriend, 
Guido
 has a girlfriend. So she sa ys, he™s okay. 
Who was t his girl? Wel l, there was, in m y class Œ I was back in second grade, in 
m y proper class, a little girl whose father was a philosopher. The y were Americans, 

but he had studied Œ taught, whatever, for many years in
 England
, and the y™d just 
come back from 
E
ng land
. And he was now the facult y, and he Œ his daughter was 
a classmate of mine. She struck me i mmediately as being civilized. She was the 
only European, and it was a different way of being. And we became very good 

friends, and she then Œ complicated life, ended up going back to 
England
 actual ly, 
and became a great poet. Her name is 
Anne Stevenson
, she™s won all sorts of 
prizes. 

Q: Rings a bell. 
A: She wrote a book about 
Sylvia Plath
, which is controversial and so on. And 
we™re in touch with each other. H
ersister was in 
Anne™s 
class, because the y 
ultimately went over to this other school as well. And we™ve remai ned friends. So 

there were contacts, t hat usually had to do with something not exactly Italian, but 

European, somethi ng. Or there were people Œ there was a great, old classics 

professor, who lived to be a hundred, named 
heners 
Œ Hendrickson
. When 
Anne
 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

and I were engaged, and all sorts of people in t he Italian-American community here 
were so excited about t he fact that this Itali an was marryi ng into this great, great Œ 
Q: Yankee family. 

A: Œ family. Professor 
Hendrickson
 came to see m y parents, and sai d Œ who we™d 
become a good friend of, because he was somebody who was Œ who knew 
Italy
 
before the great migrations and so on, and in finding Italians, said to t hem, oh I™m 

very glad, because I want you to know, t hat this a good family. He, tel ling Œ I was a 

friend of 
Anne™s
, he said, great-grandfather, who was 
a 
professor in t he law school 
and treasurer of the university, who died i n 1906, but this guy knew him, as a 

friend of his, and the y™re really good people, so I™m glad Œ so again, t his funny, 

reverse Œ 

Q: But also very t ouchi ng. 
A: Very touching. 
Q: Very, very touching, and Œ I mean, again, as you™ve been speaking about the 

Italian worl d, and t he It alian world, as I keep saying for two millennia, you know, 

of your family, and the history, one could make an assumption that some of the 

success of the peopl e who were part of your family, is built on those who came 

before. 

A: I suppose. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

Q: You know, connecti ons and this and t hat, and so how much talent do you really 
have to display? 

A:I mean, who 
Œ 
Q: But when you come here, you have none of that. 

A: Yeah, who knows? And Œ 
and it 
Œ m y parents did not  put pressure on us. I think 
that both my brother and I knew very well, that we had to do well, because I think, 

when somebody in school asked me, why do you work hard? You™re so bright, you 

can do everything easily. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Why do you work hard? And I s Œ I know I said, because I have to be able to be 

on m
y own if anything happens. And so that while m y parents protected us 
enormously, I think both 
Paul
 and I knew that we had to rebuild because we had 
this Œ we were oka y, but i mmensely fragile. Because if anything had happened to 
them, it ha Œ and we saw, you know, also, other people who hadn't be Œ m y father 
had been tol d by his father, it™s very nice you want to study medicine, but 

remember, you don™t really need to work for a living. Fortunately, m y father 

ignored that , and Œ 

Q: Studied medici ne. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi  
 
July 27, 2017 
 
 
 
135
 
A: Œ studied medicine. So when we came, t here was something t hat he could do. 
My mother was a learned Œ 

Q: Person.  

A: Œ person, and so could do something. There was another Italian-
American
-
Jewish family that ended up in 
New Haven
, t he time that  we were here. Oddly, 
because the younger si ster of this man™s wife had gotten a fellowship to study at 
Yale
, just a much younger person, and so t hese two ended up here. He was of a 

familythat wasextremel y wealthy insurance peoplefrom 
Venice
. And she was of 
good family, not great and so on. She hadn't st udied as much as m y m other, she 

was not that. And he was an insurance man, of a great busi ness family. They came 

here. He worked in a factory. She got picked up by this wonderful headmistress of 

an elementary school to teach French, so t hat we all learned French from Madame 
[indecipherable]
 who is this Italian woman, and so on. And that  was better 
enough. B ut in a wa y, people like 
Paul
 and me, saw how i mportant it  was, if you 
were not in a world that knew you. And we didn™t even know of a world that knew 

us any more. We didn™t  even know. This was t he world that we knew, that we 

were. And so it Œ t hat probably was somet hing that drove us to Œ well, 
m y parents 

never Œ never said that Œ you know, the fact of getting good grades and so on, was 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

136
 
something that in m y fami ly was always Œ  everybody alwa ys had, so that that was 
not an issue. That was not Œ 

Q: It Œ anot her thought that I had as you™ve been certainly telling me the past of the 

Italian branch of the family, is when did you learn these things? It must have been 

here, because you were six years old when you left. 
A: Oh yes. I learned things here, some from my parents when Œ when I went back. I 
happen to be a person who was alwa ys bl essed with a great memory, and a very, 

sort of broad interest. So that when I went and met relatives there, I would talk t o 

them about their history, I would hear about t hem. And all of these t hings sort of 

got learned, some here, some from my brother, who knew things in a somewhat 

different wa y than I did. But more, I think just in talking t o m y parent s, and in 

being interested in t hings in which, to some extent the y were not. They were much 
less interest ed in their ancestors, because to them i t had come as a mat ter of course. 
Q: Of course. 

A: And so
mehow you were, youknow 
Œ t he y were people for whom this whole 
ancient hist ory was kind of Œ you know, a bot her. For me it was something that was 

kind of interesting to know who I was, in a pl ace where I wasn™t. 

Q: Interesti ng 
way 
Œ well put, you know. 

 
Interview with Guido Calabresi

137
 
A: You know, and Œ and so that Œ that became, and so I™d listened and I took these 
things in. And by the way, that™s why I™m i n a hurry, I™ve written a draft of this 

book. It™s an ugly draft, it™s not well, but I™m almost 85, and how long I™ll last I 

don™t know, and I want ed to get it down on paper so that if I don™t get  it in shape, at 

least it™s there, because I™m the last one who knows these stories.  
Q: The y™re i mportant stories. They paint Œ  they paint a world, you know. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And the y paint the i ndi
vidual destiny.
 
A: The y pai nt a world of people who somehow thought that not hing could happen 

to them, found themsel ves in desperate danger, reacted to t hat in a variet y of 

different wa ys, and then find that people, i n a variety of different ways and of 

different means, saved them. 
Q: That™s huge. 
A: And that™s remarkable. 

Q: Yeah, that™s huge. 

A: And that™s remarkable. And Œ and it i s different from different Holocaust tales 

of others. 

Q: Judge

Q: I think 
A: Œ a part Œ I just Œ you know, I™ve loved meeting you t wo. 
Q: Thank you so much, and it™s been mutual. I Œ we could talk so much about your 

postwar career. I will  just sa y now that amongst your students was one of our 

former presi dents, President 
Bill Clinton
.  
A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: Who appointed you a second circuit court judge, is that correct? 

A: Yes. And he Œ 
well, and 
Hillary

Court. 

Q: 
Summer Œ 
Sonia  
Œ 

A: 
Clarence Thomas

Sonia Sotomayor

something about their schoolwork.

what I said when I was appointed a judge, t hat 
America 
di d do for me, and people 
here, all sort s of very, very good t hings, and i t didn™t do it for others. And one of 

the things of being a refugee is seeing what  was done for you, and who did it, and 
trying to do that for others.  
Q: Thank you. 

A: And in the end, that™s most important.
