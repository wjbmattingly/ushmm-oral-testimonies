today. W e're glad to have you here. I
 
know you have just atremendous am ount to 
share with us. So we'll start right away.
 
 
You were a m edical student inVienna,Austria, in1938, when 
the Nazis banned Jews from  university studies.  Before we talkabout the events that 
happened af ter that, wh
athappened with thewar and you were tryin g to get out of Austriaand 
com ing to the United States,f irst tell us whatyour lif e was like before thoseevents began,in 
your f am ily, your community.
 
>> Charles Stein: Right.  I was born in1919.  93 years ago. T hat'sa long time.
 
 
[Cheers and Applause]
 
 
W hat am azesm e is I'm  still talking. 93 years ago I didn't talk.  It 
was a different sound.
 
 
Anyhow.  I went to school.  As am atter off act, as some of you 
m ight know, the Europeaneducation system  is completely diff erentfrom  the UnitedStates.
 
W hen I was 6 years old, I enteredelem entary school. T hat lastedforf our years. Elementary 

school is a f our
-
year course.  
 
 
Af ter that, in Austria,at thetim e, you hada choice.  If you 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
wanted to go intooneof the trades, a plumber or electrician or som ething like that,all you had 
to do was go to schoolfor anotherf our years.  You had to stay in school until you were 14.  
And then you went off.  If you wanted ahigher education, as I did, you went toa differen
t 
school where you satfor eight years.  And this is completely diff erentf rom any of  your schools 

here.  
 
 
T hoseeight years we all, all of us that started thoseeight years, 
were still together.  And the program was, again, com pletely diff erent.  It was 
a ll a c ademic .   
T here were noneof  the nicethings that youhave in your m iddle schoolsandhigh schools 
here.  None of that. Ever ything was the subject, including such very im portant things at the 
tim e. Maybe not today. 
 
 
Seven 
years of  Latin?  Five year
s  of  A
ncient Greek.  I read 
ever ything.  And the last tim e I saw those things was at the endof  the eight years when we 

took our f inal exam s
 
an
d said goodbye to allthebooks that we hadtranslated,and off we 
went.
 
 
T hef inal exam  was a two
-
week exam  and still is today. T here 
were f our subjects, one on each, when you sat in there, got your questions, and then wrote.  

Math, of course, youdid
 
--
 
you solved your problem s.  On all theothers you wrote essays or 
translations. 
 
 
T he only thing that we couldd
o other than
 
--
 
was f oreign 
languages.  Forthe last four years of thoseeight years you could either take English or 

French. And that should take one hour after the regular school hours.
  
T he school system at 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
7
 
the tim e wasf ive hours a day, six days a week.  Saturday we went to school.
 
 
At the endof  that, of course, If inished. Andyou got
 
--
 
a t the  
endof  these exam s, you gota certif icate that said you are now eligi ble to enter auniversity in 
whatever subject you had. I optedf oram edical school.  And this is not, again, like inthe 
United States where you have
 
--
 
m y kids and m y grandchildren right now are waiting f or the 
answer f rom  all theuniversities to get in.  No. That certif icate madeyou eligible to move in.
 
In thosedays we didn't wr ite.  Everything was done inperson.  Registration.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Nothing online. That'sfor sure.
 
>> Charles Stein:T here was no line.T herewasn't even anon. 
 
 
W ell, at thatpoint we picked up som eform s that we had tof ill 
out. As I was f illing them  out at home, it wasm ainly your name, rank and serial number type of 
thing.  Just the regularthings.  For your registration.
 
 
I came to the last item  on there.  And thatpuzzled m e. It said, 
when you come in,bring thatpiece of paper,your birth certif icate. Ok, no problem.  And your 
sign.  My what?  I hadno idea what that was. Never heard of it. SoI turned to m y f atherand I 
said, hey, I got to have this sign. T he sign, by the way
 
--
 
I should translate this for you.  
Citizenship certif icate.  Apparently everybody in Austriahad a citizenship paper.T hey got it at 

birth, Ithink,or whatever.  Inever didf ind outall thedetails becauseI didn't have one.
 
 
Som y f ather toldm e we don't have one.  I said, well, how 
com e? And he explained to me thatattheend of W orldW arII, when Austria became what is 
now Little Austria

>> Bill Benson:  Attheend of  the 
F i r st Wor l d  W ar
 
>> Charles Stein: Before that,Austria,of  course, as youprobably know, the Austrianemperor 
ruled over what then became Austria, Czechoslovakia, most of Poland, most of Rom ania, 
Yugoslavia andthe northernpartof  Italy.  All of  that was Austria.  Everybody was an Austrian 
citizen who li ved in there.
 
 
W ell, when Austria becam e Little Austria, they passed a law 
im mediately that allpeoplebornoutside of the new borders of Austria had to get
 
--
 
apply f or 
citizenship.  And it was a routine thing.
  
 
 
Now, 19 years later
,  
my f ather tellsm e that he didn't think he 
neededthat because,as you saw in thepicture, he was in theAustria
n  A rm y. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  So hewas a veteran thinking he wouldn'thave to do that.
 
>> Charles Stein:  He was in the AustrianArm y.  He was an Austrian.  There was no question 

about it.
 
 
Now, going back to why
 
--
 
both of m y parents were born outside 
of  t he
 
present
 
--
 
thenew borders of  Austria. But I had lived in Viennaf orm ost of m y lif e.
 
 
Anyhow.  So two years later,m y father now tells m e, we became 
sta te
le s s
.  Again, adifference between Am erica and Europe.  In America if you're born here, if  
your parentsare, whatever, you are an American.  Not so in Europe.  InEurope, if you'reborn 

in Austria,f or exam ple, you are
 
--
 
you have the citizenship of your parents.  Until you're 21. 
T hen you canapply.
 
 
W ell, inm y case,I was stateless.  And whatthatm
eant at the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

tim e was thatm y tuition atthe university was now three tim esthat of an Austrian. T hings were 
not good. Pretty bad, as am atter off act. Still in 1937. But m y parents scrapedupenough 
m oney, and I was a proud m edical student in about the
 
e n d of  A u gus t
 
1937. W alked into the 
university, and it was great.
 
 
W ell, then cam e the11th of March 1938.  I hadf inished thef irst 
sem ester. I had taken two exam s.  And I was now eligible and could apply to beequalized in 

tuition.  I turned in this those papers.  W e were now in the second sem ester.  Andby March of 
1938.  I went tothe universit y, walked in.
 
 
Now, the classroom  atthe m edical school, the anatom y building, 
is som ething like this theater.  You walk in on topand you sit down.  Andthe p
rof e sso r sit s 
down below, and all of that. 
  
Anyhow, I walke d in up there. And Inoticed on the top row, the 
top row there were m en standing. T he entiretop row was f illed. All the men were standing.  
Andall of  them  wore storm  trooper
 
unif orm s. Nazi un
i f o rm .   
 
 
T he puzzlem ent aboutthat was that the Nazi party f our years 
bef ore that was outlawed.  There was no Nazi party.  There were no
 
--
 
you didn't see any.  And 
on thatday they were there. I hadno idea what thatm eant.
  
Some of them had pistols sti
ckin g 
in their belt. They didn't say anything.  They just stared at everybody.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Noneof them
 
--
 
they were notf ellow students? 
 
>> Charles Stein: Could have been.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Could have been.
 
>> Charles Stein: Could have been.  Ihad no idea who they were.

So anyhow, the restof  us went down, sat down. W e went 
through the lecture. Got finished.  In the afternoon I spent upstairs in a room where I was 
dissecting a body, aspart of m edical training.  Andaround4:00
 
I left. W alke d  
out. W ent down 
the street.  And Iheard noisebehindm e.  Iheard people yelling.
  
SoI turned around. And I 
noticed that these storm
 
trooper characters were chasing one student. And what I heard were 
things like " kill all the Jews"  and things like that
. 
 
 
Anyhow, I decided that that was notfor me. Ibetter get out of 
here. I went down thenext corner, turned the corner. This is an area where there were 

apartm ent buildings.  I went into thebasem ent of  theapartmentbuilding and waited there.  It 
fe l
t like hours. It was probably just afew m inutes.  I cam eup, looked around, everything wa s 
quiet.  I wenthom eand told m y parents about what I had seen.  And we had no idea what it 

was.  T his was ona Friday evening. 
 
 
On Saturday m orningwe f ound out. 
 
T here were 
ﬁE
xt r a s
!ﬂ
 
a ll 
over the street.  You opened the windows and heard theboys, "
E
xtra!  Extra!" W ent downand 
got one.  Found out that the Germ an Arm y, Hitler had crossed theAustrianborder atm idnight, 
was on his way to Vienna.  There was no resistance.  All of a sudden no resistance. 
 
 
On Saturday m orning there was going to be a big parade in 
Vienna
.  
Hit le r,  
Goebbels
, the topnotches were going to be there. It was going to be on
 
--
 
there'sa main street in theoldareaof  Vienna
, a
n avenue that
 
goesfrom  the Danube on one 
side to the Danube ontheother side.T hat'swhere it was going to be.
 
 
W ell, Sunday m orningI got up and I said tomy parents, I'm  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

11
 
going to go down andsee
 
--
 
we hadno ideawhat was happening. W edidn't know who these 
peopl
e were.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you wantedto see whatwas happening.
 
>> Charles Stein: Yeah.  Andm y parents told me not to. And, of course,at thatage
, 
I wen t.
 
 
If you have been in the m useum  or if  you're going into the 
m useum , look
 
--
 
you're going to the
 
f ourthf loor.  Going around. T here's a barrier there.  And 
right bef ore you getto thatbarrier is a videothat shows exactly whe re I was standing.  Imust 
have been standing right where the cam era was.  Directly across the street f rom the Vienna 
sta te  o
pera house.  And as you can see on that video,on this picture up there, I saw a couple 
of  cars with policeor military.  And then a big open lim ousine with Hi tler, G
oering
, G
oebbels.
  
T here were two because of all the VIPs.  And all of  Austria was there.
  
It was jamm ed. T he 
streets,there wasn't room for onem ore, Idon't think.  And allof  them  were standing therewith 

their arm up yelling "
A y!  
Hit le r. "
 
>> Bill Benson: T housands.
 
>> Charles Stein: Must have been am illion people. W ell, at thatpoint.,
 
I didnot lookat the 
rest of this.  Now I knew.  And I ran home.  Iwalked in.  I rem em bered the words I said tom y 

parents.  I walked in and said, tim e to start packing, we got to get out of here.  Andm y parents 
said,well, we don't know. 
 
 
It d idn 't ta
ke long tof ind out.  It was about two days later.T he 
f irst proclamation came and blasted all over town.  T he Jews were no longer allowed to enter 
the university.

>> Bill Benson:  So you're acting
 
--
 
>> Charles Stein: I was an ex
-
m edical student. 
 
 
T he  
next thing I f ound out, the f ollowing day
 
--
 
this was on 
T uesday.  I was out som ewhere
. 
 
I was com ing back.  Inoticed inf ront of m y apartment 
building, on the ground floor in theapartmentbuilding, there was a store
 
--
 
in thosedays there 
were apartment
 
buildings that hadtiny little shoe stores, owned by the husband and wife 
operating it, lived in the apartment behindthe store.
  
AsI cam e upthere,I noticed that there 
was a truck standing in f ront
 
--
 
or was it the other side of the street? A truck st
anding on f ront 
of  the store. I saw storm
 
troopers in uniform wa
lki
n g o u t  of  t he
 s
tore with boxes of  shoes, 
putting them  on atruck.
 
 
W ell, Ididn't cross the street with them around.  Not only were 
the storm
 
troopers there, but there were two policem en theref rom my police station, which 
was ri ght on the corner, just around the corner f rom  wherem y house was.
 
 
As am atter off act, on thefourthf loor, again,you wi ll see it.  Or 
have seen it. W hen you com earound thef irst bend there,there is abig, large picture of awall 
with lots of  people standing in line inf ront of a police station. T hat isthepolice station where I 
lived next door to. 
 
 
Anyhow.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they're looting this store.
 
>> Charles Stein: Yeah.  The store was completely empty.  I walked across the street.  I said, 

what happened?  He was in tears.  He said, they took everything
; t
here is nothing lef t.T hey 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

told him  thathehad a requisition to requisition all boots,m ilitary, wha tever.  In theprocess 
they tookeverything that was in there. Therewas absolutely nothing lef t.  Not a box.  
Ever ything was gone. 
 
 
My thing started.  Firstthing I wanted todo was get apassport.  
I knew I had to get out.  I went to the police station long before there was a line.  As am atter of
 
fact, there was no line at all inthose early days.  People just hadn'tf igured it out yet.  I knew I 

hadto getout.  I knew you hadtohave a passport.
 
 
Now, at thetim e, rem em ber, we hadno ideawhat em igration 
m eant. Nobody em igrated anywhere. W e didn't know what to do. But wef oundout very 
qu ickl y.  
 
My f riend andI got together,and we startedm oving around. W e 
went to em bassy.  And we said we'd like to com eto your country.  And they toldus where to 

go.  It wasn't exactly their country. 
 
 
E xc e
ptf or the American Em bassy. T he Am erican E
m ba ssy wa s 
a  little  d iffe re nt.
  
W e got there and they toldus that Am erica, there was a quota systemf or 
each country.  And it was not by citizenship, but it was by your placeof  birth.
  
I  s i gn ed  up .   
Filled out 
t h ef o rm s  and  a l l  of that .
  
I didn't know anybody in Am erica that would bring me in, at 
th a t tim e.
  
 
 
Anyhow, I went on. Then theother things started. And you see 
lots of  it up in them useum. T hey starteddraggin g peopleout.
 
 
Now, how this is done is ver y sim ple.  At that tim e everybody in 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Austria hadto register with the local police,no matter where you lived.  You had to register 
with the local police stationand you had to give your reli gion on that thing. 
  
W ell,  it  wa s  s im p le  
for the Nazis and their cohorts in the police to f igureout who lives inthis area, all Jews.  And 

they go to thedoor, knock on the door, takea bucket of water and atoothbrush and com ewith 
m e.
  
T hey dragged them  out into the streettoscrub the street.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith toothbrushes.
 
>> Charles Stein:W ith toothbrushes.  Down on their knees. You see thepicturesup in the 
m useum .  People would gatheraround. 
 
 
Oneday I was at oneof  m y cousin's homes. Her husband was 
out. She was older than I was.  Her husbandwas
 
out. W e talked. There's a knock onthe 
door. She opened thedoor. There was a man in unif orm out there
:
  
S t o rm
 
trooper. And he 
says, hey, Jew, get a bucketof  water and a toothbrush. She stepped aside.  She wentto the 
kitchento getthat.  And he saw m e standing there. He said, you, you Jew
 
--
 
wh y I did atthat 
point whatI did, Ihave no idea.  I reached into m y pocket,and I pulled outmy ID.  
 
 
You saw som ething sim ilar tothis ID. This is theID card we

W ell, Iput thisupand I just held this up.  My picture here.  And 
again, here is that

you may have seen it up thereor noticed it.  It says Auslander. T his is the

theone you had to show as you walked into the building.
 
 
Ok. T his little thing saved m y lif e. And this is about theonly 
docum ent I still have.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So hethinks you're just aforeigner.
 
>> Charles Stein: Yeah.  At thatpoint the guy looks at it and says, get out of here. Again, the 
reasonfor that.  I thought about it.  I talked to people. At thetime, they did not touch 
foreigners, whether they were Jews or not
.  I
t didn't m atter.  Because the foreigner was going 
to leave the country way and go out andtellwhat they saw or what they did to him . So I was 

f r ee .
 
 
And I used this thing. Andm any tim esfor the nextf ew m onth
s, I 
didn't wear a swastika arm band or pin.  W henever I was stopped, I just pulled this thing out 
anddid the same thing, and it worked.

you' ve m ade thedecision

you're workin g 
hard to get out.

f rom one em bassy tothe other.

>> Charles Stein: It was the other way around. W
ell, one day
 
--
 
oh, let me back up. Before 
then, a couple of months after all of thishappened.  I cam ehom eone day and I was told,m y 
m other told m e, that two of  m y f ormer classmates
 
--
 
the parents knew all the classmates, the 
sam e people f or eight year
s, so. T wo of m y form er classm ates now in storm
 
trooper unif orm  
cam e lookingfor me, knocking onthe door and said, is he hom e?  Mother said,no,he'snot.  
T hey didn't say anything and walked away.
 
 
W ell, I knew these kids back in 1929 whenI entered tha
t 
particular school, the eight
-
year school.T hey were in the Hitler Youth.  Long bef ore Hitler 
e
ven took over Germany.  Hitler Y
outh, 
it was a small group in HitlerYouth. W ell, they wer e in 
there. And I knew they weren't com ing to wis h me well.  At thatpoint I went into hiding.  And 
f rom  then on I just didn't go hom eany
 
m ore.  I called in.  Every oncein a while, lateatnight, I'd 
sneak in, do som ething, get outagain.
 
 
Many of  m y f riends, som e of  m y f riends, their parents let me 
stay f or a couple of
 
days.  T here were som edays when I didn't have any
 
p la ce to sta y, b ut it 
was sum mer tim e andI'd stay

get intothebushes in the park somewhere.
 
 
Anyhow.  I lived through it. 
 
 
Now, Luxem bourg.  So this oneday I am  downtown again.  
Downtown was the safe area.  I'm  downtown.  I was with som eof my f riends. And oneof  them 

said, hey, don't you have a stateless passport?  I told you I started looking.  I gota stateless 
passport sinceI was an Austrian citizen.  I said, yeah, got it inm y pocket.  He said, I just heard 
a rumor
 
--
 
and this is what we did every day.  W eexchanged rum ors.  Mostof  them  didn't

I heard that.T hat was good enoughfor me. I said, we

Luxem bourg G

Em bassy?  No idea.  OrConsulate.  It turned out 
this was an honorary c onsulate. Luxembourg didn'thave
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  An embassy.
 
>> Charles Stein:W edidn'thave an em bassy in Luxem bourg either.  Luxembourg was too 
sm all at the tim e.
 
 
Anyhow.  I went intoaphone booth and looked in thephone 
bookandf ound the Luxem bourg Consulate was about two blocksf rom  where I was standing.  
It didn't takem e very l ong to getthere. 
 
 
I go t 
there. I got to the building and looked at thenum ber.  
T here was anapartm ent building.  Ihadno idea
 
--
 
I thought it was som e kind of a big thing, 
like theother em bassies.  But it wasn't. 
  
Inoticed on the side of the doora brass plaquethat 
said Luxem bourg Consulate, thirdf loor. I walked in. I got to the third floor. It looked like 
apartm ents. And, again, I saw this little thing.
  
I was standing there, tookm y passport out of  
m y pocket.  And I was thinking, what am  I going to do? This is what 
the m an told m e was a

to tellhim  where I'm  going? T here's nothingin m y passport,no

you had to have a

yes, I would like

I understand I can get a transit

I'm  waiting f or an

T hat is theday, this is now 19

the sum merof  1938.  Ithink, 
noton the record butI'm  pretty sure, Ibrokethefour
-
m inute m ile.  I got out
 
of  that place and I 
ran home
f
or thef irst tim e in the daytim e. I hadn'tbeenat home. I told you I was in hiding.  I 
just ranhom e.  And Itold m y parents.  You should 
have 
gotten a passport. They still didn't 
have a passport. T hey said,ok.  Everything's f ine.
  
I told them
 
I'm  leaving.  M y m other said, 
Godbless you. Ok.  So I said, I'll be leaving in afew days.
 
 
T he next day I called. My m other toldm e that shehad told what 
happened tom eto a f riendof  thefam ily a young couple that they werefriendly with.  And the 
husband was ina concentration cam p.  
 
 
I didn't mention that before. One of thef irst things that 
happened was any Jew that owned any kindof  abusiness at the tim e in Austria, if  his 
em ployees wanted to get rid of  him  and take ove
r the business, all they hadtodo was go 
down to the secret police, the Gestapo
, 
and tell them  get the Jew out of there. And they did
.  
An
dall of  these people that were arrestedand takenout were sent to the concentration cam p.
 
But at the same time, in
 
Austria, at that tim e,or in Germ any atthat tim e, if anybody
 
--
 
not as a 
crim inal but only because they wanted totake his business away, wa s in a concentration 

cam p.  If he had a place to go, if  he hadfam ily, got him  a
 
vi s a  
to som eplace,they would

re l
ease him .
 
>> Bill Benson:  As long as he leaves the country.
 
>> Charles Stein: As long as he leaves the country.  He had48hours to leave. 
 
 
So when I calledhom e the next day, m yf ather got on the 
phone. My f ather told me that this young couple, husbandhad losthis business that way, was 
ready
 
--
 
was on his way hom e. Again,his wif e had gotten a Luxem bourg
 
vi s a  
and could I 
please wait because she was af raidthat they m ight be inbad shape.  And she was right.
 
A couple of days later,got therethe next
 
day andthen a couple of days af ter that,toldm y 
parents tomeetm e atthe railroad station.  Iwas headed to Luxembourg.  He was going to be 

there,
 
t o o.
 
 
I got tothe railroad station, andm y parents were already there. 
And m y father hands m e
 
--
 
I to ld
 
him , justa little bag. I have no idea where I'm  going. 14 
days.  Im ay have to cross the river or som ething.  Go into France orBelgium. And m yf ather 

hands me likea gym  bag
, a
 
small gym  bag.
 
 
I looked over tom y m other, she had in her handm y violin
.   M y 
violin case.  She hands it tom e.  I said,m ama, what am  I going to do with a violin?  She said, 
well, m aybe some
day
 
--
 
th i
s is her saying now, maybe som eday you're hungry and you won't 
be able to eat. Somaybe sell the violin andhave something to 
eat for a few days. 
 
 
At the present time, we were in tears anyway at the tim e,I 
couldn't talk to her anym ore.  I said,all right, m am a, I'll take it. W e got on thetrain. Tookoff .  

T his was aroundnoonon thatday. W e sat inthe train and we were scared.  But nothing 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

20
 
happened.
 
 
W ehad to change trains aboutf our tim es in the next 24hours. 
Usually it takes eight or 10 hours. It tookus 24 hours because we had to change trains
 i
n 
Munich. And every tim e we got to a railroad station, we sort of  got out of the way where 
hopef ully nobody woul dfind us. And it worked. 
 
 
W egotto theLuxembourg border, still in Germ any. W ehad to 
change onemore tim e, close to the border. Got on the train.  And just before theborder, 
which is the Mo
s
e lle  
R
ive r, ju st b
ef ore the bridge acrossfrom  Luxembourg, the train stopped 
and two storm
 
troopers walked in and said, "
A
ll Jews out."  There were only the two of us in 
there.W e got out. And they took us toa couple of buildings, sm allbuildings, different room s. 
 
 
I  wa
s in there with aGerm an officer, aman.I don't know what 
exactly he was.  But it was not m ilitary.  Custom sor som ething likethat.  Anyhow.  So he 
looked atm y bag.  He looked at m y violin.  He opened up everything.   And talked very nice 
and gentle. He was an olderm an.  He thenfinally askedm e what Iwas going to do, what I 
did.  I saidI was a medical student.  He said,are you going to study again?  I said, yes, I hope 
so.  Andaway we went.  He hands mem y thing and says, go, go back on thetrain.
 
 
At that tim em y m ind was such that Ididnotbelieve thatthey 
were going to let m e go.  Idon't know.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You thought that was the end of  the line there.  Yeah. 
 
>> Charles Stein:W ell, he opened the door.If igured som ebody's going to g
rab m e.  W alked 
out.T here was nobody out there. W ent back to the train.  Not even asfar as theend of this

room . W ent in there.Went out and waitedfor Max. 
 
 
T he train was about to leave
.  
Max cam e out,cam e running, got 
on the train.  He told me hi
s sto ry w
as a littledifferent since he was in a concentration camp.  
T hey searched him . They tookeverything apart that he had.T heym ade him sign apiece of  
paper.
 
 
Now, the Germ ans atthat tim e, this is somebody that's going to 
leave the country.  Not
 
going to be there anym ore.  Made him  signa piece of paper thathe will 
never tell anyone thathe was in a concentration cam p.  Germ anm ind atthe time. 
 
 
W ell, anyhow. W e goton the train. Aboutf ive m inutes later 
we're across theborder.  And we takea deep breath. And Luxembourg being a huge country 

tookus another 10 m inutes to get to the center of  the city, Luxembourg 
C
i t y.  W e go t  ou t . W e 
walked into the station
, t
he waiting room in the station where the ticket off ice was.  It was about 
a quarter
 
of this room. Very sm all place, but lots ever people in there.
 
 
Andfor thef irst tim e, we thought
 
--
 
we lookedat eachother. We 
hadno idea where wewere. We didn't know what language we heard them  speak a language 
that we didn't understand. W e got used to it. And it turnedout tobe a littledeviationf rom  
Germ an.  Just recently they applied to the United Nationstom ake ita real language.
 
 
Ok. W e didn't know where we were. W edidn't know where to 
go f rom  there.  And,again, luck is with us.  From the cornerover there comes the voice. "Max, 
when did 
you 
get here?"  Lookedaround.  Saw this gu y.  Somebody he knew in Vienna. 
Cam e over.  Turns out this man had been
 
thesam e as we, gotten there the week beforeand 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
knew all the answers.  
 
 
It wa s a
round noon.  He said, have you had lunch?  
W
e 
said,
 
no
, w
e haven'teaten since yesterday
, n
oon yesterday.  So he tookus toa place where we got 
som ething. And we f ound out that this organization ESRAhad various places we could goto 
eat.T hen he took us to the organization who then took us tothe police, took our passports 
away, gave us another pieceof paper.  Andthis is when we f ound out,f inally, this was nota 
tra n sit 
vi s a
. W e were now in the legalhandsof  thisorganization.  Andfor the nextf ew
 
months 
they had an agreement with the governm ent that they would get usout 
of  
there to someplace.  
T hey had lots of places around the world they were sending people. 
 
 
W ell, I was there. Shortly af ter I got there, I received a letter 
f rom m y m other saying that she had justfound out thata cousin of hers, who around the turn 

of  the century, back around 1900, had gone to Am erica.  He was aboy thenf rom the tim e 
when she was born.  She just f ound out
 
f r om  s o m eb od y
 
thathe was still alive and this 
address
.
  
S
aid write tohim . And Idid. 
 
I wro te  to  h im . 
 
 
About amonth laterI got a letterf rom him saying, yes, I 
rem em ber your m other, and, yes, I'll help youbut I don't have the means tof ill out one of those 

A
f f id a vit s  of  
S
upport, the paper you need to g
o to Am erica
 
but
 
I have som eone who is working 
on it right now.  Anda few weeks later I gotthat piece of paper. 
 
 
Andnow I have to go to the American Em bassy and I said, 
where is the Am ericanConsulate? And Ifound out there wasn't any in
 
--
 
any in Luxembourg.  
It was in Belgium .

23
 
 
So the organizationthat helped us,f ed us,f ound quartersf orus, 
they were doing everything for usand they said, no problem , you'll get a Luxembourg stateless 
passport. T he Austrian passport was one ofthose gray passport
swit h  b ig,  b la ck st rip e  acro ss 
that said stateless.  In Luxem bourg, som ething m uchnicer.  It was a green one with the big 

stamp. But still stateless.  Ok. But I hada passport. And I went toBelgium. I didn't needa 
vi
sa.  Luxem bourg, Belgium , Holland, andeven then were working together asa unit and you 
didn't 
v
is a
, justa passport.
 
 
I went toBelgium . I turned it in. And the Am erican Consulate, a 
young m an was very h appy with m e. I was apparently thef irst onethathad come in there that 

spoke E
nglish.  Itold you Itookfour years of English af ter school, at m y school.  Oh, he was 
ver y f riendly.  He said,no problem . 
 
 
Aboutf our weeks laterI get a letterf rom theem bassy.  I thought 
that was it. It says everything's f ine,but we needf rom your sponsor one more piece of paper.  

Some docum ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:  From the sponsor in the United States.
 
>> Charles Stein: Yeah.  In the United States.  So I write to the United States.  Slow m ail. A 
few weeks later I get that.  I go back toBelgium . I turn it in. And the guy looks and says 
ever ything's all right.
 
 
Make a long story short.  A year later I was still bringing in 
papers. T he lastpaper I brought in was
 
--
 
this is now a year later, in August of 1939, the end
 
--
 
the last week in August, brought back one piece of paper. Turned itin.  And them an toldm e 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

24
 
the same thing.  Everything's f ine now.  Andtwo days later, f irstof  September, war breaksout 
in Europe. Franceand Englanddeclare war on Germ any.  Germ any on them . And we're 
s it t in g 
right between them .
 
 
I have time to tell you this little thing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Iwant you also to talk about your parents. 
 
>> Charles Stein: Yeah.  I'll get that shortly.
 
 
So at thispoint there were f ive of  us, all about m y age at the 
tim e . A nd  w
e decidedif  theGermans come in and the war starts, France is here,Germany is 
here and we're sittingbetween, we're dead. So we do something.
 
 
And this isf or your entertainm ent I'm  telling this.  Because it was 
for ourentertainm ent, too,at the tim e. 
 
 
So we got onthe train. W e went tothe French border. W e 
walked out.W e walked into the place thereand proudly announcedwe are here to jointhe 
French Foreign Legion.  And they educated us.
  
W e saw somem ovies.  Guys riding the 
cam elsand all of that. W ef igured Af rica.  Af rica is about close enough for us to get away 

f r om .  A nd  t he y e
xplained to usthat the French Foreign Legion was com posed of mainly 
escaped prisoners, m urder
er
s, killers, thieves that fled their country 
and found a home in the 
F re
nch F
oreign
 
--
 
well, they put uson the next train back to Luxem bourg.  And I guessf or 
about two, three days, we were in hiding. W e were kind of asham ed to have done that. 
 
T hem ovies did thatto us.  Anyhow. 
 
 
T he war was on. T wo weeks later, on the 15
th
 
--
 
yeah, 15th of

September, I received a letterf rom the em bassy, and m y m ind was, oh,another piece of  
paper.  But that was different.  It said come totheembassy on the7th ofOctober to get your 
vi s a
.  Ge t the re . A nd  go t it. 
 
 
Now, f astforward to about m iddle1980's.  Ipickedup oneof  the 
m agazines, newspapers one day, "T ime," " News week,"  som ething like that. AndIfound an 
article in there thattells m ethat in1938, itstim ethat I was trying to get my 
visa
, there was 
an
 
--
 
a secret orderf rom
 
the State Departmentfrom  the U.S. StateDepartm ent to all the 
consulates inEurope. Not exactly in those words.  But it says, hey, we got all of these Jews 
want to com e in, keepthem  out as long as you can.  Put allpossible obstacles.
 
 
Now, one of thes
e  
--
 
there actually were t wo of  them .  And one 
of  them saidat theend, all kindsof  things, donot
 
--
 
keep them  outas long as you can. And 
delay anddelay.  T wice. T hat was doneby a m an named
 
--
 
and look him  up.  You'll f ind him  
now probably in your encyclopedia, computer, anywa y.  A mannamed Breckinridge L
ong, a 
ver y high, num ber two, num berthree man in the State Department. He put out thatorder. It 
wa s cla ssif ie d .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Until the 1980's. 
 
>> Charles Stein: Declassified 30 years af ter
 
the war.  Anyhow, that is why I hadto wait all of  
t h is  t ime .
 
>> Bill Benson:  For over a year you were stalled.  You were stalled. 
 
>> Charles Stein: Yeah.  W ell,f inally, I had the 
vi s a
.  Atthis tim eIguess there was a new 
policy with the war on.  I went back and they found me, theorganizationf ound me,a ship. But

notuntil December. This was October. Notuntil Decem ber.  Andon the 18thof  December, 
1939, Iarrived in New York.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Charles, before we continuefrom  there,our tim e is
 
getting short. W hen you 
were in Luxem bourg, you tried to get your parents to com e.
 
>> Charles Stein: Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about it.
 
>> Charles Stein: Oh, yes.  Right.
 
 
In 1938
 
--
 
I lef tout thisonething.  On the9thof  Novem ber, 
1938, we get
 
the message in the newspapers and on the radio the night of  thebroken glass. 
Kristallnacht, known inGerm any.  One night,9thof  November. They went outand destroyed 
ever ything, ever y Jewish store, plundered it.LikeW ashington in1968,much worse.  K
illed  
about 3,000
 
--
 
oh, every s ynagogue, every sin gle synagogue.  I think there were about in 
Germ any andAustria som ewhere like1,000 synagogues, big and sm all. They were burned 
down.  Thef ire departm ent cam e out to protect the buildings around
 s
o thef ire wouldn't 
spread.  But let that burn down. W hile allof  thathappened, 3,000 Jews were taken into 
concentration cam ps.  It was m urder.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Is that when your parents realized
 
--
 
>> Charles Stein:  At that point
 
--
 
at thatpoint, right af ter that, Ifound out that there was am an 
in Luxembourg who sm uggled peopleacross theborder
, p
eople wi thout the

.  Form oney.  
I had som emoney.  
 
 
I mentioned m y violin.  T hat violin came inhandy.  Because

And gotenoughm oney together.  And I went to them an, talkedabout it,and he said, yeah, I'll

But I wrote tom y parents.  This is now going into January of

shehasn't seen you in a long

I wrote thatand If igured m y parents would understand. And 
they did. And they cam eback.W e corresponded inpostcards. Letters didn'tm ake it
 
through 
anym ore. They stopped all letters.  Postcards they could read and send on.
  
On the appointed 
day, m y parents were there. Am an went there.  AndI had some ofm y Luxem bourg f riends 
off ered to hidem y parentsuntil they could get legalized.  This is possible.  It's beendone

On the appointed day, I went to thef riends. Them an told me he 
probably won't get there until about3:00
 
in the morning.  So anight operation. 
  
W ell,

W e 'r e

says, hey, I come here all the time.  I go herefor m y business. I'm  going home. So they said,

And they said,

T his is what theman tells m e.  Ididn't believe it.  I have thought

we were back home. W e wrote in code.  Yeah, we had our vacation,
 
and we're backhome. 
 
Shortly af ter that

whatever you have.  Just one suitcase

At that tim ethey evacuated som e slum buildings and putall the 
Jews in there. All over town. T his happenedtom y parents. T hey moved about two, three

1 %.

[Laughter]
 
But probably

m ay not believe this, but I lived on
 
$14 a week. T hepeople that sponsoredm e, 
I said thank you, andthat's the last tim e I
 
saw them . They didn't invite m e in. I didn't want to 
be a burden.
 
 
Anyway, I was in New York.

Shortly af ter I graduatedfrom  off icers

well, I was in Oklahoma.  I was ina classroom  som ewhere. MPman cam e in. Talke

T here was am ajor sitting there. He said, close the door.  Closed the door. He said, raise your 
right handand swear.  I had no idea what I was swearing to. T hat Iwi ll never tell anything 
what happenedhere.Oh, it m ust be good. Ok.  I swear.  AndIf ound out. He pulls out orders.  
I just graduatedf rom  artiller y school.  Big guns, you know, I knew all  about them . And he

At that tim e somebody in W ashingtonapparently had woken up 
oneday and said, hey, we have all of  thesepeople that speak theenem y language, German, 
Italian.  All of us were pulled intoa brandnew thing, 
Milit a r y I
ntelligence.  U.S.didn't know 
m ilitary intelligence before then. Som ebody invented it. T hey talked to the British. And there 

we were.
  
Anyhow, we were trained.  On D

Now, you asked aboutwhat happened tom y parents.  After the 
war was over, I cam eback andI started looking f orm y parents.  I tried everything 
I could, Red 
Cross, a number of things, butnothing.
 
 
If oundout in 1940, som ewhere in1946, thatthe Jewish 
C
omm unity in Viennawas reconstituted,openedupagain, andthatthey had all the records
 
--
 
the reason why all the records were still in the old 
Je wish  C
omm unity was because Eichm ann, 
thebig killer, Eichm ann had taken over that building as his headquarters and everything just 
stayed where it was.  Well, when theGermans lef t

>> Bill Benson:  All of those records.
 
>> Charles Stein: All the records were still there.  Sof inally aboutayear af ter the war, the 
reorganization was reconstituted.  I wrote to them.  Andthey wrote m eback. Saw that little 
pieceof  paperthere that says your parents were deported to the Lodz ghetto in October of 
1940.
  
T he same time I went into theArm y. The sam e week, I think. A coupleof  weeks 
difference. But anyhow, sam em onth,anywa y.  And the pieceof  paper saiddo not appear on

cam e f or a tr

Idid not speakupfor I was nota trade unionist. T henthey cam e
