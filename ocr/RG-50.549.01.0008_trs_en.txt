Q:
 
W ell, let m e ask you Mrs. Farka
s, to start, I'd like to spend most of  the tim e 
talking to you about af ter the war, af ter the Holocaust, af ter the, in the years, and 

starting out just in the years just af ter liberation andIwant,if youcanandwhen 

you can, f or you to tell stories of  how you f eltatthattim eandspecif icthingsthat 

you m ight rem em ber f rom  people that you m et, experiences that you had. I read a 

little bit in the interview that you did back in 1990, about,soIknowalittlebitabout 

how
 
you were in Sweden and then you cam e back. But, what I'd like to dointhe 
tim e that we have this af ternoon is just have you go intosom em oredetailabout 

those things and in, m ore than anything, I suppose, the incredible challengeyou 

m ust have had to r
ebuild your lif e in som e ways af ter such a horrible thing 
happened. So, in a way, it's, it's som ething that I think can educate people to see 

how som eone is able to rebuild their lives in the way that you did and so, Ithink 

that's one of  thereasonsthat 
the Museum  wanted m e to com e and talk to you

som ething had changed, when you opened a door and you saw a Red Cross?
 

A: Yeah.
 
QQ: Can you talk about, m aybe we can start with that and talk

door large, they said that we are f ree and we will be go to Sweden with the 
Sweden Red Cross. And that m om ent, we were in the wagon at least 16, 17, 16 up 

to 17 f em ales. Everybody started to cry, to scream , we f eel just som ething 

unbelievable, that is __________ because we were very weak, days we didn't eat,

were transported not too f ar f rom  there to a f arm . T he name of thattownname 

was Badborg(ph),
 
that was in Denm ark, on Denm ark soil. And wewere,andthey 
help us to get down f rom  the cars and was, they give us to eat Haf enf lock(ph) with

hot cereal with milkandthey 
said, don't eat too, they give us portion, not, we didn't 
take voluntarily f rom  som e big pot, they gave us the portion and they said, som e 
girls, they were asking f or m ore because we were starving. T hey give us a good 

portion, but we could eat m ore.Andth
ey said, " No, you should eat with very big 

caution because you can get sick. You are starving and you don't, are notallowed 

to eat too m uch at once" . T hat we understood and that was af ternoon. Af ter that 

they give to everyone, they give som e sleep bagsan
d we went to a, they take us 

to a, very close to that location, to a, how you say that, to a site where we were 

sitting on the f loor with those bags and __________ those sleeping bags and we 

were overnight there. W hat happens in that tim e? W ith us were also the

together get those girls and start to beat them verygoodwithrevengef orhowthey 

had, were behaving in the lager.
 
Q: Did you see this happening?
 

A: I see, but I was so weak that I couldn't, I was happy that I couldn't lif t m y arm, 

but not enough strong
 
to go take part in that beating and one of  them  was even 
arrested, a couple. A Jewish couple. And she was arrested and they took her 

away, I don't know where. But those girls, a f ew of  them , were very good, verywell

beaten. T hat was that. Inthem orning,
 
again in those Red Cross cars and they 
took us to the railroad station, put us in some wagons, but they were beautif ul 
inside, they were personal wagons. T hey were with velvet chair and, you see, very 

f ancy wagons. And we were so f eelbad,If eelbadbeca
use we were f ull with f leas, 

to sit on those nice seats or to lay down or som ething that, but wasnoother 

choice, we just sit on the chairs and they take us, transport us to Copenhagen.

us on a ship and we went to Sweden by shiptoMalm ar(ph),thesoutheastpartof  
Sweden, Malm ar. T here again, they put us in cars, in som e wagons and theytook 

us in a forest, was a f orest, I think was a m ilitary base there because a m ilitary 

people take care of  us, each one separated, they pick our clothes, they get to do 

the bathing and then we went to
, we were seen by a doctor. I rem em ber m y skin 

was so pinched by the f leas, that the doctor thought, they put m e a note on m y 

wrist, on the paper, on that note was written, scabies, but I said the doctor, it's not 

scabies, these are the pinches of  the, of  
the f leas. And I just said, because he was 

talking in Swedish, I just said, no, no scabies, and he understood. And thenthey 

give us clean clothes, they put, in that tim e, there were tables in thebeginning,or 

using disinf ectant, they put som e DDT  powder 
on our head, we had already a little 

hair, the hair already grow af ter in Auschwitz was cut down, and with a towel, they 

m ake a turban around our head and, again, by bus this tim e, they, wewentto 

Lanskrone(ph), is not f ar f rom  Alm er(ph), we enter in a school and the school was 

transf orm ed in dormitories f or us. In the classes, we were six, seven girls,again 

with those sleeping, sleeping bags and the doctor then check us af ter the bath. If

dead. I __________. When we were in that wagon, onenightIwasnot sleeping,I 

hear som ebody was, in the wagon outside, andtellto
 
our soldier who was with us, 
sitting on the open door with his legs outside and he told tooursoldier," Our 

Fuhrer is dead". And we passed this news to all of  them  inside. T hat m eans we 

knew that Hitler is kaput and we, we werehopingandwewereveryan
xious to see 

the end of  the war. T hat, when we saw the Red Cross outside, we were surprised, 

Barbara Farkas
 
12
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
but no very surprised.
 
Q: Righ t.
 
A: W e were waiting f or that because we knew that Hitler is dead and the war will 

f inish very soon. But, even with that, we start t
o scream , to cry, m any of  us were 
scream ing, " W here is m y m other? W here is m y husband? W here is m y child?"  

You know, this kind of  scream ing they heard.
 
Q: It m ust have been such a com bination of  em otions that you had at that 

m om ent.
 
A: T errible, it was a 
very, very hard tim e. Very hard tim e. T he thing, I tell you, we 

were so weak and our m ind was so depressed som ehow, that we can't 

__________ really what is going on.
 
Q: Perceive?
 

A: Perceive what is going on, you know? W ewerenot, we couldn'tthinkvery 

d
eeply. Just what happens, happens, but no, no very hard, very deep f eelings 
because we were so weak that we couldn't think about so deeply som ehow.
 
Q: W as it alm ost like a f eeling of  being num b?
 

A: Yeah, som ething that, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 

Q: And as the day
s, in those f irst days of  liberation went on, do you rem em ber the 
kinds of  em otions you had as you started to eata littlem oreandasyou,som eof  

the f irst sensations, like the taste of  the food and the..
 

Barbara Farkas
 
13
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: T he f eeling of  f reedom , do you rem em ber those kinds of  f eelings? And also, the 
terrible sadness you m ust have f elt.
 
A: Yeah, the f eeling was that to get back to m y f am ily. I knew that m y parents, I 

was the only child to m y parents, I knew that m y parents arenotalivebecauseI, 

when I was se
lected by Mengele(ph), he took m y m other to the lef t and I, he took 

m e to the right. And I knew that, af ter that, already in the Nazi cam p, that who went 

to the lef t, they went to gas cham bers, but I didn't know anythingaboutmyf ather 

because the m en and
 
the wom en were separated im m ediatelyaf ter,whenthey 
arrive in Auschwitz. And f irst, the wom an went to beselectedandthe m en,they 

were at the back and the line was so long that I didn't know what happened to m y 

f ather. I have tim e to kiss m y father at
 
the, when we arrived, when we separated, 
but when I was separated by Mengele, showing to his helpers, to take m e to the 

right, I had no tim e to say a word or tokissm y mother.Anditwassom ething 

unbelievable, you see, I was so, so conf used, so, I can't
 
explain that. In the f irst 
day in the lager, the Nazi cam p, I was like a, living in a dream, in a bad dream . I 

can't perceive what's going on around m e. And m y f riends in the, in that lager, in 

that block, they shake m e and said, " Barbara, you wake up, wake up, don'tthink 

so" . You know, they thought that I, I lost m y m ind. But af ter a f ew days, really, I 

wake up and I start to eat that terrible f ood. T he f irst day I didn't eat because I was 

Barbara Farkas
 
14
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
in a so big shock that I didn't know, I didn't know what is going
 
on around m e. 
 
Q: Now, going back to those f irst f ew daysaf terliberation,doyourecall,didyou 
have dream s at that tim e, dream s like could you f ind your f am ily...
 
A :  No .
 
Q: Or dream s of being f ree or not being f ree?
 

A: I have nightm ares, all the tim e being chase, som e...
 
Q: Chased?
 

A: Chased, that kind of  dream s I had all the tim e, even now, I havethatkindof  

dream s, to be chased and trying to hide. Trying to hide.
 
Q: Do you remember the details of  those dream s?
 

A: Yeah. T hat I was in a, in a room an
d som e Nazi soldier cam e in and want to 

take people out and we try to hide, you know, that kind of  dream s I had.
 
Q: Uh
-
huh, do you rem em ber som e of the things like what you were wearingand 
where you would hide and those kinds of  things, or is it m ore of  a
 
general...
 
A: No, m ore general, general.
 
Q: How did you f eel towards the people who, the Red Cross people and som eof  

the soldiers who, f rom  the Allies, who...
 
A: W e don't see, I don't see, didn't see any liberators, I m ean soldiers. Because 

f rom  the wagon, they took, I was transported to the, im m ediately in the RedCross 

wagon, that m eans no soldiers. T hey were Red Cross senators, I m ean with 

Barbara Farkas
 
15
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
unif orm  of  senators, that m eans I didn't see a liberator.
 
Q: A n d ...
 
A: And I was lucky that I was in that group be
cause the others they were in 

Bergen
-
Belsen and that was typhus, how you say?
 
Q: Say that again.
 
A: T yphus, typhus. You get that...
 
Q: Oh , typ hus.
 

A: T yphus, typhus, you get that f rom  the f leas. But our group didn't have, m aybe 

there were som e cases, but I
 
don't know those people. In Bergen
-
Belsen there 
was, there was a big epidem ic of  typhus and m any people die, you know. JustI 

said, I was very lucky that I was in that group because I heard af ter thatthatin 

other lager when they were, when they werelib
erated by soldiers, the Russia or 

Am erican or English, English soldier, they give them  all kind of  food, __________, 

and the people started to eat and they were starvingandeatthatheavy 

__________ f ood, m ostly m eat, they get sick and m any die.
 
Q: Because they couldn't digest?
 

A: T hey can't digest and it was not for the stom ach, those heavy f ood. But we get 

all the tim e, very, very dietetic f ood with, f or our very weak bodies, you know, we 

get very, everybody was very skinny. And the doctors, they prescribe diet and 

m edicine, vitam ins, so that m eans was very, they werevery,verynicetous.T hey

take care excellent.
 
Q: You were describing, m oving back now up to where you were talking about 
bef ore, the m om ent that you were staying in theschooldorm itory, 
and you were 
talking with some of  the other, som e of  your other f riends, did you start to think, 

you know, I have to put m y lif e back together now, I can't just, were you f eeling at 

all like you were rely, you didn't want to rely so m uch on other people?
 

A
: W e were not thinking f or the f uture, f or the f ar f uture, just what's going now, 
everybody want to go hom e. I m ean, to the countryf rom wheretheycam e,tof ind 

out who cam e back f rom  the f am ily. W ho cam e back. Just I said, one was looking 

f or her, f or th
e f iancé, the other f or husband, the other f or parents, so on, they 

were thinking only about that. Because I was the only child and I knew what 

happened to m y m other, but not to m y f ather, I was thinking how togetbackto 

Rom ania and I knew that in south T ransylvania, were m y uncle and hisf am ily,two 

uncles and one aunt, they are living, I knew that they are alive because f rom 

Rom ania, we f ind out, there was no deportation to Poland, to Auschwitz. And I 

tried, when the people f rom  the Rom ania Consulate cam e to see us, Igivethe 

address, I knew the address of  m y uncle in Arad(ph) in south Rom ania, to send 

them  or let them  know that I, where I am . T o m akecontactwiththem ,thatwasin 

May, I never receive any answer, nothing. Many of  m y f riends and the oth

A: W e went polite, we went, but when they invited us again, we find som ething to 

say and we said, I'm  sorry I can't go or som ething that. And that tim e, cam e 

Christm as, you know, '45 Christm as. And where we were living in ourapartm ent, 

the landlady was a very nice lady, was a divorced lady with a 15
 
year old girl, and 
she gave us present f or Christm as and even I give som e kind of  unif orm  f or Santa 

Claus and I give the presents to other, some just kind of  jokes. But, ingeneral,

can't tell you by num ber how m any, other people like us, f rom  Poland,f rom  

Hungary, f rom  Czechoslovakia, and we were choosing to m eet with them ,to

to present lif e, we talked was

lef tover f ood. We, we cook f or ourself  in Urebro, the last place where we were, we 

cook f or ourself  and we never threw out lef tovers and we always said, " You see, 

don't throw that out because that would be good in Auschwitz" . And if  you'ref illed 

up, you don't have to throw it out, just put it in the ref rigerator and eat it som ehow 

next day or third day, but don't throw it out. Nobread,nof ood.T hatwas, even 

now, I have that f eeling to don't throw out any f ood, lef tover.

was thinking all the tim e, what s
he was thinking, som ething, what was in her m ind 
when she, she was taken to the lef t side and what happens then. Youknow,inthe 
ghetto, you know, Rhadia(ph), we were living at the house, in the apartm ent of  a 

rabbi who was the rabbi who taught m e Hebrew every Sunday at, in Sunday 

school. T hat means we were very close to them. T hey were old people. And when 

we went in f ront of  Mengele, in the line was, the side to Mengele, was the rabbi 

wif e, in the m iddle was m y m other and I was,Iwasontheinsideof th
at line. And 

f rom  inside that __________, Mengele took m e and put m e on the right side, you 

know, f rom  inside. T hat was very easy to don't see m e and just let go the line 

because they were going pretty f ast, not walking slow, but pretty f ast we were 

p a ssin
g in f ront of  him , and I was thinking, if  they wouldn't take m e, m aybe, no 
m aybe, I was sure get to the gas cham ber together with m y m other and the rabbi 

wif e. W hile I was inside, very easy can, can, can happen, that he didn't see m e, he 

just oversee me or
 
som ething, but it was unbelievable, that fear of , and those 
nightm ares, to get hidden all the tim e in my m ind.

Q: T hat thought of , the twist of  f ate, of  how you ended up on the right side, seem s 
like it's been with you f or so m any...
 
A: Yeah, that was whatIsaidbef ore
, that in the f irst day, when I was put on the 

right side and I was already in the block, in that terrible place, and we were at least 

800 people in a sm all, not so sm all, but very,verycrowdedplace,theycallitblock, 

I was so num b and just how I said.
 
Q: Do you ever wonder why, how it was that they, whytheychoseyoutogotothe 

right side?
 

A: Because I was young, they looked to the f ace, theychoosetheyoungerpeople 

who he thinks that is capable of  working or do works. You know? T hat way, not f or 

his good will, no, just was a good person to work f or them .
 
Q: Do you rem em ber then when you, the f irst day that you realized that now I'm  

f inally going to go back. You were in Sweden, you wereworkinginthef actory,do 

you recall what it was like the day
 
that you realized that you were going back?
 
A: Yeah, they, yeah, I was very, very happy, very, very happy.AndinSweden,we 

m ade very good m oney with our work. W e bought, m yself  and the others,too,alot 

of  things. W hen I cam e hom e, I have two biglugga
ges f ull of  clothes, shoes, 

handbags, coats, a little jewelry. I had two Om egawatchesand thatm eans

knew that I will go to university and I will have not money to buy f ive years 
any

clothes, and I tried to buy f or winter, f or sum m er, all kind of  clothes to haveitf or 
that tim e. And I was right because when I cam ehom e,Isoldone of thewatches 

and was enough f or m e one year f or, f or pocket m oney. Because m y uncle, he 

wasn't a ri
ch m an, they were evacuated f rom  the town in Rom ania and taken with 
two luggages to Ara(ph), to the bigger city. T here were concentrated all theJew 

f rom  the towns in the one city. T hat m eans all, everything what they had, was lost. 

And he had a job as a accountant, not big salary, and I didn't expect from  them  to 

help m e. I was happy that I have that to go hom e and in vacation to go to them  

and, but no, I didn't expect to help m e with m oney. AndIdidn'tneedit,I'lltellyou 

why, because at the university, it didn't cost m e a penny. T he whole f ive years.
 
Q: Even your food?
 

A: Nothing, nothing, not a dorm itory nor the f ood, I m eanthecanteen,northef ee, 

nothing. First of  all, because I didn't have any, how you call, anything onm e,I 

m ean no house, no, 
no nothing. I was considered with no property. Secondly, 

which was m ore, m ore heavy to f or them , I was a very, very good student. And 

they give scholarship to good students. And thatm eanstherewerethree 

categories of  scholarships, f irst degree,secondd
egree, third degree. And I was in 

the f irst degree with no f ee, no pay f or thedorm itoryandnopayf orthef ood,f or 

cantina. T hat was the situation, that didn't, and when I cam e hom einvacation,m y 

uncle send m e m oney for the railroad to com e hom e.T hat
 
was all. And I guess

Q: And when you first got back, what was that reunion like with your uncle and the 
f a m ily?
 
A: Oh, it was very thankf ul, I was crying, and they, again, they were very, ve
r y 

good to m e, they didn't ask m e how happens, what happened, because they knew 

that I am  very, very sensitive, you know, and they didn't ask what happened, how 

was there, nothing, they didn't happen, they, what I tell them , they accepted, but 

didn't put q
uestions. And that was, that was very good because I didn't live through 
all m y, all my past lif e again, that was always very painf ul and Ihatethosepeople 

who was asking all the tim e about how was in the Nazi cam p because I was living 

through again those em otions.
 
Q: It m ust have been hard enough to not be haunted byitanyway,evenwithout 

people asking, you know, it was probably hard enough to try to put it out of your 

m ind.
 
A: Yeah, and then when I cam e hom e, that was very sad, the story, com ing hom e.
 
T hey sent us f rom  Stockholm  to Prague by airplane, you know. In Prague we 

arrived just the day bef ore the __________, and they didn't let us leavebecauseit

going there, and when
 
they f ound out, talking to us, that we came f rom  Sweden 
and go back to Rom ania, they said, " Are you crazy? W e com e f rom  that andyou 

go back there?"  And we were a little bit scared, you know? 
 

Q: W hat were you scared of ?
 

A: T hey said that the econom icsi
tuation is very hard, that they don't have f ood, 
that Russia occupation, they were at that time still they have Russia soldiers all 

over. And we were a little bit scared, but didn't want to go back. W e could go back 

to Sweden or go to Am erica or som e where
 
else, but we said we won't go back 
because each of  us f inds somebody f rom  the f am ily who was already home. And 

we want to go back there.

route, was not, just by train. W e went to the, they took us to the, to the railroad 
station and we were staying within the, how are the,thosewagons,youknow,on 

the corridor, not with, not cove
red, how you say it? Outside of  the wagon, 

between...
 
Q: On the platf orm ?
 

A: On the platf orm .
 
Q: T he station platf orm ?
 

A: On the station platform , we were staying there because there was no room  

inside. In Prague, the Consulate, the Rom ania Consulate, put us together with 50 

Rom ania soldiers who cam e back f rom  west, they were prisoner inwestand now 

they give us the visa f or all of  us. Seven girls and I think 10 or 15, I don't rem em ber 

exactly how m any Rom ania soldiers. But they were very, very nice tous 
because 
we have heavy luggages and they help us f or a package of Am erican cigarettes, 

we knew this and we had a lot of , 10 or 15 package of  cigarettes we had, each one 

of  us, the girls, and we give them  cigarette just to help us with the luggages. It was 

v
ery nice. Until we arrive at the Hungarian border and we get down,becausef rom  
Budapest we have to go to Arad, to Rom ania, you know? And then we get of f  f rom  

the train at the Hungarian, inside Hungaria, Hungary, at the border, was a Sunday 

af ternoon. And many peasant people were at the station looking who is com ing, 

who is going, you know, in the town, the big, the big thing is to go to station and

know, they ask us who are we. And we said. And you knowwhattheysaid?" T oo 

m any cam e back".  T hat was the f irst __________ in the Hebrew, how you say, 

when you get a...
 
Q: Slap in the face?
 

A: Slap, it was the first big slap in the face that, what they said was, too m any, they 

cam e back too m any. W hen we say that we were deported by the Nazis, they say, 

too m any came back. W e said, a good beginning, but we could __________, that 

already we could return. And f rom  Budapest, we went to Rom ania, Im eantoArad 

because the border within Hungary and Rom ania is through Arad, I m ean the f irst 

city in Rom ania is Arad, but the border, how you call it, whereistheborderisthey 

call it Kortitsch(ph),  Kortitsch is the litt
le town that they do the checking of the 
passports. And then was again a big trouble. T his soldier, they have som e, som e, 

how you call, those m ilitary blankets, green m ilitary blankets and the Hungarian 

border soldiers said that they steal that, those blan
kets. And the soldiers said, " No, 

we get that f rom, I don't know, they cam e f rom  France" . T hey were prisoner 

because they were f ighting with the Germ ans, with Russia, up to __________, the 

Germ any and then they go then to France, anyway, they cam ef rom Fra

it was af ternoon, to get through was only half  hour to go through, to enter 

Ro m a
nia. T his was on Hungarian side. T hey said, " You have to stay here until 
tom orrow m orning". Oh, we were despaired, wewereveryscared.Becausethere 

were m any Russia soldiers around. And we were af raid that they will com e to us 

and take the luggages and maybe som ething else they going todo.W ewerevery, 

very scared. But soldier were staying at the door, these Rom ania soldiers, and 

they said, " Don't be scared because we don't let them  in".Andtheyturnof f the 

lights, that m eans they can see that if  som ebody in, you know? Andsom ehow 

cam e the m orning and we also, f unny position,wewent,wepassed theborder 

and arrived in Rom ania. And then, oh, there was also trouble at the border. They 

get all of  us down and looked at our luggages. Also, two packagesof
 
cigarettes 
had the ef f ect, you know. And one of  the railroad worker ask m e, ask each one of  

us, f rom  which, f rom  where are you? And I said Arad and he said, " Look, I am

A: I, the industrial was f ive years, the prescription was
 
only f our years.
 
Q: And you did the industrial.
 
A: I did the industrial. As a student, in __________ was very, very jolly. Because 
we have parties, we have m any reunions, every week, at least three tim es, we 

went to opera, opera was very, very,verycheap
. Mostly we entered with not 

paying, sitting on the stairs upstairs. That was the student's life, but concerts and 

very, very cultural lif e we had.
 
Q

A: I tell you the truth, we, I wasn't com m unist, but we believe it, we have it good as 

a student, we had a good lif e, you know. Not im portant to us, the, we study, we 

had good m arks, we had all kind of  advantages, you know.
 
Q: P a

A: T hat was in the beginning, you know, it was not __________, it was 

__________, that was in '48, I started in '46 and I f inish in '51. T hat m eans, the 

problem  was that it, that dorm itory in __________ was Alta(ph) Mark(ph). Alta 

Mark was a, was a m athem atic prof essor at the Jewish high school in 
Clu j
, bef ore 

the deportation, but he died bef ore the deportation. He was lucky, he die inbed.

they gave his nam e, that m eans that nam e, the name of the,that,howyoucallit,

Q: Student housing?
 

A: Yeah, yeah, som ething that, the housewasab
ig villa of  a f orm er bank director 

who didn't cam e back. T hey have upstairs and downstairs dormitories, we had, the 

girls, we were six girls, we had on the lower level and the boys were on the top. 

But, we get very well together, it was noproblem between 
us, it was no boyf riend, 
girlf riend situation. T he only good thing was that whenwewenttoopera,wehad, 

we cam e hom e with our room , not room m ates, our neighbor boys, theycam e 

together with us. And you know, if  you cam e hom e just girls at night, the opera was 

ended around 11:00 and m ore, we cam e together with the boys, that was all. 
 

Q: Now, during this tim e, in the '46 through '51, did you f indthatitwasatall 

possible to, and were you trying consciously, to start, to try to live a normal, quote, 

nor
m al lif e af ter all these terrible things? W ere you able to justlivelifewithout 
thinking about it all the tim e?
 

A: I tell you som ething, what was, not onlym ine,buteveryone whowasdeported,

easier that you are not alone in that terriblesituation,losingyourf am ily.Idon't 
want say that helps, but it som ehow a little bit easier when you knowthatyouare 

n
ot alone in the sam e situation. 
 
Q: And was that the case f or you?
 

A: Yeah. 
 

Q: During these tim es as a student, as well?
 

A: Yeah, yeah. Because I was very m uch preoccupied with m y studying, you know, 

studying and then, well, if  som ebody, they saw that, I m ean the room m ates, saw 

that is a little depressed or som ething, that, they took you to the operaortosom e 

parties, you know, they didn't let you alone. T hey were, therewasaverybig 

cam araderie between us. 
 

Q: And these were other people who were also
 
survivors like yourself ?
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of  them .
 
Q: And I also wonder if , and I guess this could apply f or the f irst m om ent that you 

stepped back onto the Rom ania soil, as well as the years f ollowing, did you f eel

college in the university was very, very a good atm o
sphere.
 
Q: And did you experience anti
-
Sem itism  at all while you were in college?
 
A :  No t  really.
 
Q: No ?
 
A: T hat was in the beginning, you know, then was the big f raternity withinthe 

m inority and the Rom ania, the com m unist ideal.T oeverybodyisequal and 

everybody is your brother and, that tim e, but later on, we can, very dif f erent, you 

know. In that tim e, in m y, when I was, I tell you som ething, to please the Hungarian 

students and Hungarian people in T ransylvania, they open a Hungarian university 

in  Clu j

Rom ania university as a dif f erent study, a dif f erent material som ehow,their 

language, not everything in Hungarian, just som e of  them , you know.T hat,butthis 

was the beginning when everything was in rose.
 
Q: And did you f eel at that tim e in the, in those years attheuniversityinthelate

know. And then was, once was a selection when they elim inate the party m em bers 

which they think out that they are not 100% f eeling com m unist. And they ask m e 

once, because I was from  Arad, when they wereverif yingastudent whowasf rom

I was not originally f rom  Arad. T hey ask 
m e to go to be present when they, when they verif y him , how you say it, verif y? 

W hen they check him , openly in f ront of  the others.
 
Q: W hen they investigate him ?
 

A: Yeah, investigate him  in f ront of  others. And that
 
I dislike and I was very,how 
you say, shocked by that attitude. T hey, they f ind out and they ask that student, 

that when he was 13 years old he was a Zionist, he went to the Zionist, Zionist 

m eetings. And he say, " Yes, I went to that Zionistm eetingsbec

about him  and I said, "I know, I don't know him  when he was 13 years old because 

I cam e to Arad only in '40, in '46, I didn't know him  bef ore" . T hat was that.
 
Q: So they were asking you about your credentials, your loyalties?
 

A: Yeah, I was like a m artyr, like a, like eye witness som ehow. And I said," Idon't,I 

didn't know him  before, I had no idea what he did when he was 13 years old" . T hat 

was one. In the sam e, in the sam e tim e...
 
Q: And what year is this, excuse m e? W hat year are you talking aboutnow?W hen

ey say that he was m isleaded, he was not threw out 

f rom  the party, but the Jewish student who at age 13 went to Zionist m eeting 

because he can't go to other m eetings, other, he was throw out. T hat was a big 

shock f or m e.

December 9, 1995
 
 
 
A: W e m et again and we get m arried in April. W hen I went back to 
Clu j
 
to  stu d y, 
he was staying i
n Arad, separated. In 1950, in the f all, you know. Came a law in 
Rom ania, Rom ania, that who was to em igrate, can em igrate.
 
Q: T o  Isra el.
 
A: Israel. But you have to go to the police and take a f orm , f ill it up, give it back and 

wait to get yourem igrationp
assport. And I rem em ber, was a Yom  Kipper day, I 

was still hom e, it was in the beginning of  Septem ber,Idon't knowexactlywhat 

date, and we went with m y husband and we stay in line at the police, there were 

m any Jew there, going f rom  the Synagogue to sta
y in line f or the police and the 

police on Yom  Kipper day. W e went to get the papers, we f ill it up,whathappen? 

T he police im m ediately are known, get the place where you work. My husband had 

a very good job, high position, he was a, he __________ control
, in the, the big 
f actory in Arad, they were f abricating railroad wagons. But the big one, they work 

f or export to and he had a very, very highposition.Im m ediatelytheyf oundoutthat 

we asked f or im m igration, they put him  down in a very low position, they didn't f ire 

them , just put in a very low position. Iwentbackto 
Clu j
, they f ind out that I am  
also, I am  asking f or im m igration, they threw m e out from  the student union. But 

they let m e f inish the school, that was the big advantage, because later on 
af ter 

two, three years, they didn't let people, Jewish students, to f inish the,theirstudy 

because they were asking f or em igration. One of  m y nieces, happened to her. Just

and very  __________.
 
Q: You f elt that you had been deceived?
 

A: Deceived, yeah, very, very m uch. And I was lucky that I could,If inishthelast 

year and that was that. Nothing 
happened to m e because that. Just they threw m e 

out f rom  the student union. Now, the rule in Rom ania was that when students 

f inish the university or any school, they put them  in a job, they give them  a job, 

of f icially. You don't have to look f or, in that tim e, you didn't have to look for f ind a 

job. T hey ask f rom  this city are you, you want to work in that area? Yeah, I want to 

work in Arad because I was already m arried, I f inish in '51, but since '50 I was 

m arried and I said I want to work in Arad because m y husband lives there. And 

because in Arad was not a m edicine f actory, you know, theygivem eajobasa 

biochem ist. Because m y study was industrial pharm acy in biochem istry and they 

give m e a job to work at the hospital asabiochem istinthelaboratory.
 
T h a t wa s it. 
W e were waiting to get the im m igration passport 10 years.Nothingcam e out. 

Later we f ind out that if  you ask to em igrate to other countries, not Israel, they had 

that, they are very good f riends with the Arabs, you know, and the Arabs, they 

didn't like it, too m any Jews to go to Israel. If  you ask f or other country, they will 

m aybe let you go. Then I wrote to m y, one of  m y, not girlf riend, a girl, we are in the

sam e city in the sam e society, in Urebro(ph), she get m arried with a Swedish guy. 
And I knew her address and I wrote to her and I ask her to send m e aletterthatI

and we present it to the police and I said even that is m y sister, but that was not 

true. Anyw

get the visa f rom  the Sweden Em bassy in Bucharest to go toSweden.Andthen 

we went, oh no, I f orgot to tell you som ething. I get m arried in 1950, in1952,Ihad 

m y girl, I  give  b irt h  t

to Sweden, she was nine years old and that was in '61. Yeah, she, no, no, she was 

born in '52, this was in '61, yeah, nine years old she was. She was avery,very 

sweet little girl, she went,
 
we had no problem  with her, she went to daycare, went 
to school and we were very happy with her, she was very, very nice little girl and 

very good girl, no problem  with her. Healthy and beautif ul. I willshowyouthe 

picture. And when we get the perm issio
n to go to Sweden, we went to, the way to 

go to Sweden or everywhere, was through Vienna. And we went to Vienna and in 

Vienna we f ind out that the Sweden want to give us the perm ission to stay there 

only f or six m onths. And I didn't want to go onthe,tom
y girlf riend to stay with her 
because she was living in a town, sm all town and f rom  there what I got workIcan 

do. I am  a chem ist, what work I can do there? And I didn't want to be on her neck 

because she was living together with her in

her. And then we went to the highers, you know highers, the __________ highers. 
Highers is a agency who help Jew to go, not to Israel, but all inthe wholeworld 

when it is possible to be accepted. And they tried to ask theStockholm J

and then we switch and we went to, we ask to go to Israel. And the lady, the 

director of  the Highers was a very, very nice lady, Am erican lady, and she said, " If  

yo u
 
want, I send you to Canada". And I said, " Oh, I don't gotoCanada,Ihaven't 
anybody, I don't know anybody in Canada, I will be too separated f rom  the whole 

world, no" . We switch and we went to Israel. 
 

Q: So it was right at that m om ent in Vienna that you decided that, or this was 

bef ore?
 

A: Originally, it was bef ore, but to go to Sweden wasonlyapretext to getoutf rom  

Rom ania.
 
Q: And af ter that, you didn't care where you were going to go, I m ean you didn't 

know that you were going to go to Israel at that point, or you did?
 

A: You know, when we were waiting in Vienna, six weeks was the discussion 

between the Highers and the Sweden, we were staying six weeks on their account, 

on the Highers account in a hotel, and theywerebargainingaboutus.T henIsa

A: Yeah. In those years we were, m y cousin, m y uncle to whom  I cam e back, they 

went to Israel in '58, 
you know, and they wrote that it is not easy, you know, in that 

tim e it was not easy to, even now it's not easy to get agoodjob,buttheywere,m y 

cousin was a, becam e a chem ical engineer and he get a very good job at,ata 

Am erican chem ical f actory and 
m y uncle was not so old, was only 60 years old, he 

also had a little job. T hat m ade things there pretty good. And they ask ustogoto 

Israel, you know, because I was af raid, I was af raid that m y husband can't get a 

job because he was a, an accountant som e
how, you know? I knew that I can get 

job very easily as a chemist, but I was af raid of  him , you know. T hat was m y f irst 

idea that what happen if  we go there. He doesn't know the language and how he 

can get a job.

tim e Israel was under British dom ination. W as the hospital is f rom  that tim e. And 

they sended m e, us there and I get a job at the hospital in the lab. Even if Ididn't

shocked that we interrupt the interview and only af ter f ive weeks we arecontinue

com pletely dif f erent f rom  now because was bef ore and af ter the six day

bit, not scared, how you say? Nervous, somehow.
 
Q: Anxious?
 

A: Anxious that __________ som ething can happen in the bus in which we are 

going hom e or com ing to work. And that m ay be because m y pastwas soterrible 

and that was influencing m y thinking because the Israelis, they were not scared, 

they were very courageous and they were not af raid of  anything. But, m yself , I was 

a  lit t le b it  s c a ry.

Q: And those years later, those 23 years later, you had, you were saying that it 
was unsettled all this tim e, and then you were obviously, understandably, so upset 

a ga
in, but during that tim e in '67, when you learned that your f ather had died in

A
: Yeah. I couldn't put them  to rest in m y m ind, notm ym other,not myf ather.T hey

Barbara Farkas

December 9, 1995
 
 
 
W as part of  what you wanted f rom  Israel, well, let m e ask you this way, what did 
Israel represent to you, particularly as a Holocaust survivor?
 

A: I was f eeling very goodaf tertheanti
-
Sem itism  that I was f eeling in Rom ania in 
the last years. Not f rom  the beginning, f rom  the last years.Specialwhenwewere 

as
king already for im m igration and I feel verywellbecauseIhavef riends,they 
alm ost everyone was a survivor and between survival, you f eel som ehow better 

like sister in suf f ering or som ething that. T hat m eans in thispointof view,If eel 

well. In the work, was not the sam e situation. I had abosswhowasnota nice 

m an.  T here in the lab was working a older lady f rom Bucharestwhoalsof inished 

university as m yself and we had experience, 10 years experience in Rom ania and 

that m eans we knew thework,you
 
know? But this m an, he was a m ath prof essor 
and he was trained to be a chem ist, trained. And he was very jealous of  us 

because we have a university basis in chemistry and he was just a autodeduct(ph), 

that m eans he was trained and he was learning him self .
 
And he was, just I said, he 
was not a nice m an with us, not with m e and not with m y colleague, that was very 

dif f icult to f ind the other job. I try to ask f or a transf er, but the __________wasthat 

they don't get transfer so easily, only if the,som ethin
g very serious happened. For 

exam ple, if  m y husband get transf erred to other city, they didn't separate the wif e. 

If  they are close, it is, they said he has to travel, but if  was a f arther city, they 

som ehow, very dif f icult way, they give you a transf er. That m eans I got stick there, 

Barbara Farkas
 
61
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
I couldn't get out f rom  that lab. And otherwise, the lab, the salary and the benef its 
were good. T hat m eans was no reason f or m e, f or change job, only this guy was, I 

didn't f eel, not m yself , not m y colleague, we f elt, f eel well with his behavior.
 
Q: But during that tim e, it sounds as though, outside of  work, you hadareally 

strong com m unity of  f riends who were also survivors.
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
Q: You talked about how im portant that is, I mean in what ways did that help keep
 

you going, help keep your lif e, in a way, rebuilding your lif e, I suppose.
 
A: First of  all, I have m y daughter, I, we love her very, very m uch and we were 

busy and preoccupied, how to get her education, howtodothingsf orher,you 

know. T hat m eans this 
took our m ind f or our own problem s, I m ean with the past, 

and we try to, not to f orgot, but to live f or the present, you know. Mostly, 

preoccupied with m y daughter, education and all other things related to her.
 
Q: Do you think that she ever f elt f rom you,
 
the pain that you had gone through 
and that...
 
A: No. I never told her about m y past, I didn't tell her. She knew that I was 

deported, but I didn't tell her any stories about m y past. Because when she wasa 

very sensitive girl and I don't want to that she
 
f eel bad or have, I don't know what 
kind of  bad f eelings about the whole thing. I want hertobehappy, nottothink 

about those terrible things, what happened to m e.

Q: W hat an incredible act of  strength and love of  you to...
 
A :  No .
 
Q: It m ust have been 
so dif f icult f or you not to share that. Or m aybe you never 
wanted to.
 
A: I didn't want it. I didn't want to, no. But in the school, the children start to learn 

about Holocaust, you know, and I let her to know what, how much she heard inthe 

school, how m uch they learn in the school. My own personal story, in detail, I didn't 

tell her. 
 

Q: W hen did she learn that you were a survivor of  Auschwitz?
 

A: W hen she was around eight, nine years old.
 
Q: So she, eventually, she did hear your story? 
 

A: No, no detail, just that I was there and m y parents perished there, but no details. 
 

Q: Did she ask you questions?
 

A: She asked me som e questions, but I give her the answers very, how you say, 

not exactly what she wants, she was asking.
 
Q: Vague?
 

A: Very vague, yeah.
 
Q: 
So, but you, did you ever sit down with yourself or m aybe your husband at 
som e point, af ter the Holocaust, af ter m aybe when you wereinRom ania,m aybe 

you had already com e to Israel, and talk abouthowyouhadtorebuildalif e

thinking of  the present? Did
 
you convince yourself  you needed to do that or was 
this just a natural instinct alm ost?
 
A: I didn't show him , not to m y husband, not to m ydaughter, thatIhaveproblem of  

thinking about the past, you know. I was behaving like a m other who is take care of
 
her child, of  her husband, of  her household, but no, no details, no sentim ents 

about the past.
 
Q: And yet you did have this dif f iculty, you're saying? You have these dream sand 

you have these...
 
A: Yeah, but you know, during the day, during the day, you, 
I don't want to say you 

f orgot, but you pass over this, this dream s. You have the every day work and 

problem s and so on and that goes, the dream s. 
 

Q: Did you ever f eel like you have this other interior reality thatwasjustf oryourself  

and your f riends who were also survivors?
 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
 

Q: T alk about that, can you?
 

A: I was, I didn't, m yself , I suggest to m yself not togettoodeepinthosef eelings, 

you know. I didn't want to, to, to live in the past, I want to, not to f orgot,buttoleave 

behind m
y past. And see f or the present, f or the f uture, f or m y fam ily, that m eans I 
didn't try to, try to live in the past. That was m y thinking.
 
Q: W ere there tim es where, with your f riends who were survivors,t thatyoudid 

Barbara Farkas
 
64
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
want to talk about it, that you did...
 
A: It was, if  som ething apropos to som ething, we were talking about, but notso 
very, very unf ormal, you know, and start to take all, talk over and talk about 

som ething else, not to get too deep in those feelings. And wenever,m ostlynever, 

talk about f eelings. Mostly about evenenm ents(ph).
 
Q: A b o u t?
 
A: About what happens, about things what happens. You know, but notabout 

personal f eelings.
 
Q: W hy do you think that is?
 

A: Because we want to go ahead with our lif e, not to look back and to live in those 

te
rrible thinking.
 
Q: And I'm  guessing, and tell m e if  this is right, that perhaps just beinginthe 

com pany of  people who had the sam e experience, who understand whatyouwent 

through and you understand what they went through, in a way, you don't need to 

sa
y that m uch maybe.
 
A: No, because everybody was f eeling the sam e way. Just I said, wewerenot 

talking about the f eelings, we were talking about whathappensaproposto 

som ething we were talking about, you know. But not aboutpersonalf eelings 

because ever
ybody knew and everybody f eel the sam e f eelings had, we had the 
sam e f eelings. T hose terrible f eelings that we were not talking about openly.

Q: And to this day and a couple of  tim es in our conversation, even once today, 
when I've asked you things that are
 
particularly painf ul, you don't want to talk about 
th e m , righ t?
 
A :  No .
 
Q: I m ean, you would, and I think I understand why, but m aybe you would liketo 

talk a little about why you don't want to.
 
A: I don't want to live through the sam e f eelings because if  I talk about now this, 

m aybe at night I have dream s about this and I, I f eel bad about that.

Q: Because of  everything __________?
 

A: I don't know, I f eel belonging m ostly, m ostly to Israel. AndIwentbacktoIsrael 

since those years at least f ive tim es. W e have relatives there, we have m any 

f riends, I have a only cousin, I m ean m y cousin to who's parents I went 
back to 
Rom ania f rom Sweden. T he parents were alive, too, but they die in the '60's, no 

later, in '75, died m y uncle and then m y aunt. T hat's the way how happen. 
 

Q: I wanted to ask you a couple of m ore things, Mrs. Farka
s. And I was just, one of 

the thing
s I wanted to ask you, I wanted to ask you one other question about 
Rom ania. And let's see, where does he say this, he talks about, this is in thebook, 

it's the Silent Holocaust by, how do you say his nam e? Butenaro(ph)?
 

A: Butenaro.
 
Q: Butenaro. Let'sse
e, he says, those who returned f rom  the concentration 

cam ps, f rom  the ghettos in T ransnistria(ph)?
 

A: Yeah.
 

Barbara Farkas
 
73
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
Q: T ransnistria, or from  the f orced labor cam ps, were naked, poor and without 
shelter. But they carried in their hearts, the star of  hope and unshaken f aith in the 

new world in which they would f ind the place they deserved, the place that suited 

them . T hat sounds, to m e...
 
A: T hat hope f or a better lif e, yeah, we had that, we had,Ihadthat,thatf eeling,I 

have, yeah. Special, when m y dream  to start
 
at the university becam e a reality, 
that was m y dream  f rom  high school, to go to university, but, just Isaidbef ore,I 

couldn't get to the university and when I cam e back f rom  the concentration cam ps, 

I went to university. I f inish m y study, I became an industrial pharm acist and a 

biochem ist and I was happy with that. W ell then, I was f eeling that I start a new lif e.
 
Q: As a Rom ania f irst? Or did you...
 
[end of  side one of  tape three.]
 
Q: ...f ellow, I guess he would probably be m aybe about your age now, n
amed 

Pavel(ph). He was a...
 
A: Pa ve l?
 
Q: Yeah, a Rom ania Jew who lives in Bucharest still, it was in a book I was reading 

c a lle d  E xit  t o  His t o ry.
 
A :  No .
 
Q: And he was saying that he f elt that what a lot oftheaf f ectsof anti
-
S e m it is m in  
Rom ania did was m ake people f eel their Jewish identity m ore than bef ore.
 

Barbara Farkas
 
74
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
A: Yeah, that's right.
 
Q: And what I'm  hearing, what I'm  wondering whetheryou'resayingisthatright 
af ter, with all the hopes and dream s you had, com ing back after the Holocaust and 

to a new Rom ania
, was m ore as a Rom ania than as a Jew, necessarily, at that 

t im e .
 
A: I wasn't a big Rom ania patriot, I wasn't. Because m any, m anyJewsbecame 

very big patriots, mostly com m unist, you know, they embraced the com m unist 

because the com m unist said that everybo
dy is equal, no dif f erences if  you Jew or 

not Jew, and they became a very big com m unist. But Ididn't f eelthat.Iwasf eeling 

as a Jew, even in Rom ania. In the beginning was no problem ,Ididn'tf eelanti
-
Sem itism , I told you that. But later, when I start
ed to work, m y boss was a anti
-
Sem ite, but he was hiding that feeling, you know, but som etim es cam e up. But I 

didn't care about him  so m uch because I had m y job and I, I didn't care about him, 

he didn't say anything to m e to hurt m e, just I f eel, you know,
 
you have that f eeling 
if  som ebody is not, is, if  som ebody is anti
-
Sem ite. T hat was that.
 
Q: Are there any, any particular songs or things you rem em ber about, there's a 

song that Butenaro ref ers to, All Rom ania, that people used to sing. Are there any 

t h in
gs that you rem em ber from  those days withf ondness,any kindsof songsor 
stories that you used to tell or sing?
 

A: W hen we, when m y, when I was in the high school, in Oradia, from   '37 when 

Barbara Farkas
 
75
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
we m oved to Oradia, til '40, three years, the last three years of
 
high school, I was 
going to the State high school in Oradia, by nam e,__________.Inthattim e,in 
Rom ania, instead of  Boy Scouts, you know, they have other group they call it, 

Strachere(ph), that m eans, Strachere m eans who is willing to, to lookf orthe 
saf e 
of  som ething. Here in this case, was the saf e of  the country. W e have a unif orm , 

we go to school with that, in that unif orm , we have m any m eetings and 

__________ song, but I didn't f eel any anti
-
Sem itism  in that tim e in Rom ania. I 
could be, I was one of  the good, one of  the best student in the high school, I get 

m edaly(ph) from m y study, you know, in the end of  the year they give m edaly to 

the best student f or the f irst, f or the second and f or the third, the best. I give, I 

receive always the second one because the f irst one is going to the daughter of  a 

Adm iral, an off icer daughter and her and the two of  the prof essors, ladies, had, 

their husband were under this Adm iral of f icer, Adm iral, I don't know how you say it, 

Adm iral person, and he is, he is sup
ervisor or how you say it, som ething there, and 

that m eans she was very m uch protected and with very big protection.Evenshe 

was not so good at all. But what happen, when we have the graduation exam , the 

so called baccalaureate, in Rom ania, I think still 
is the sam e rule, af ter you f inish 

the high school, is a very, very dif f icult exam , they call itbaccalaureate,whenyou 

have that exam , to Oradia, they cam e f rom  othercities,girls, in theschoolwhereI 

was studying, at least three or f our schools with girls, girls, they came to give this 

Barbara Farkas
 
76
 
December 9, 1995
 
 
 
baccalaureate to the sam e school where I was studying. T he com m ittee who was 
in that exam , they were prof essor not f rom ourschool,wasaabsolutelyneutral 

com m ission, the president of  the com m ission was a university prof essor and the 

teachers who were in that com m ission were f rom  otherschoolf rom wherethere 

were no students in that, in that, at that baccalaureate. At that baccalaureate exam  

we were around 150 girls and I pass the second onewith,youknow,thegrade,
 
I 
was the second on the grade. T here was no protect here, I m ean no Adm iral 

daughter, no nothing, just what you, how you answerandhow youwritethethesis. 

T hat was the situation.
 
Q: I wanted to just change the subject a little bit andendwithaf ewm o
re personal 

questions and I guess one of  them  is just living here,nowthatyou'vebeenhere27 

years or so. Do the events of  your lif e and inIsraelandinRom aniaandduringthe 

Holocaust, do they seem  because of  the tim e and the physical distance that w
e 
are now f rom  Europe and from the Middle East, does it seem  a lot dif f erent, a lot 

m ore distant, than they did bef ore?
 

A: Yeah, yeah. Special, in Rom ania. T he Rom ania years are very, I don't 

rem em ber, f or exam ple, m y college and the school, the nam e, I don't remem ber 

already, because I don't think about them  and I don't rem em ber. So, the sam e 

thing with the teachers, som e of  them  I rem em ber, som e of  them I don't rem em ber 

because I am  not, I am  never preoccupied with thinking of  them , youknow.Even 

Barbara Farkas

when we
 
went, I have a cousin with her husband, they are old couple, 83 and 95,

And when we go to visit
 
them , they always, every three years alm ost,andIm eetin 
the street people, I see them , but I don't rem em ber their nam e, you know. I, you 

were, they were working, how the, som e f am ily situation, but I don't rem em ber the 

nam e, I have to think very hard to rem em ber who is this guy orthisgirl.T hat 

m eans I am  not thinking of them  anym ore.Israelisdif f erent,thatIrem ember 

everything.
 
Q: Because it's m ore recent and...
 
A: More recent and m ore pleasant som ehow.
 
Q: And how about the Holocaust and the war,
 
does that seem  rem ote or is that just 
with you all the tim e?
 

A: I also don't rem em ber the nam es, I saw m y, m y, the girls with which where I 

was together, I rem em ber what color of her dress was,howwasher,shelooking 

with blond or black hair, but I don
ot rem em ber, to som e of  them  I rem em ber the 

f irst nam e, but not the second nam e, the f am ily nam e, at all. Is right that there we 

don't know anybody too m uch about the f am ily nam es, I m ean the last nam es, only 

the f irst nam e we knew each other.
 
Q: Ca n  I a sk

survival m eans to you?
 
A: W hat m eans? Som ething, a m iracle, it's a m iracle that I survive. Because very 

easy, Mengele can not accept m e and send m e to the lef t, to advance with the 

group t
o the lef t, that's all, that was a m iracle that he took m e f rom  the, f rom  that 
line and put m e on the right side. Very, very, very easy I could go to the lef t side.
 
Q: Have you thought m any, m any tim es about why? W hy you went to the right?
 

A: T o the right,
 
why he put m e on the right? Because I was young and they need 
people to work for them , that was the selection, that they were looking f or.
 
Q: Do you f eel that, any sense of  a m ission in telling your story? Do you, is there 

som ething that you want the worl
d to know about, about you and I m ean, you've 
been, we've been talking now f or som e hours on the tape?
 

A: I don't think so, I don't want, I am  not talking about to people to know m y lif e, but 

I believe very m uch in the Museum  policy that they want to prese
rve the Holocaust 

m em ory and lif e there and everything what happened there f or the next 

generation, f or the young people and by this I want to help them  to understand the 

lif e of  people who were there. 
 

Q: Do you have any, any insights in the way that you've rebuilt your lif e and the 

way you have survived and lived and raised a f am ily and m ade a hom e that you 

can share about how you, how you look at theworld nowaf terallof thishas

Q: Because, and it certainly what you're saying,itseem sthatyou're,it'sbecause 

of  your experience that you realized in a way, what's im portant m aybe?
 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. First of  all, m y, m y goal was to study andtof inishthe 

university and get a job and get m arried, have a f am ily. T hat was the, to don't stay 

alone, you know. I didn't want to, to, to stay aloneintheworld,I wanttohavea

Q: I wanted to read what Butenaro said about speaking out, he said neartheend 

of  the Silent Holocaust, that he hoped his book was a cry to strip away the layers 

of  indif f erence and guilty silence by just com ing out and telling one'sstory.Doyou, 

do you share that at all?
 

A : A s I sa id , I te ll m y sto ry f o r th e
 
benef it of  the Museum , I like and I appreciate 
very m uch how they handle the whole Holocaust problem  and everything. And I 

want to help them  by m y story in this way.

you wa
