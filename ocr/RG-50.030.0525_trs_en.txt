Question: Ve ry nice to see you. 

Answer: My personal privilege. 

Q: Tell me  when you were born. 

A: May the seventh, 1925. 

Q: Oh, so soon pers -- 

A: I shall be 83 years old in two weeks. 

Q: Right. And where were you born? 

A: I was born in a little village by the name  of Bo
tos, B-o-t-o-s, Hungarian village. It means the 
place in which you trade, in Hungarian. 

Q: Place in which you trade. 

A: In which you trade, yeah. 

Q: So where is that near? 

A: That is presently in northern Serbia, just so
uth of a town that the Hungarians call Szabadka. 

Q: Is there another way to spell Botos? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: B-o-t-o-s, the Serbs spell 
it with a little hook on the S. 
Q: I see. 

A: But it means absolutely nothing. 

Q: Right. And how big a town was it? 
A: Oh, about 1500 people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525

Q: So, really little. 
A: We  had a big -- we had a big estate, my fa m
ily had a big estate and we were -- during the 
summer we were in Botos and my mom just -- sh
e was highly pregnant and she developed her 
pains, and suddenly I wa s just popped out at the wrong time and the wrong place. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Right. And -- but very seriously speaking, my
 mo m had given birth, she was a very tiny lady. 
My dad was six foot two, 180 pounds, my mom wa
s never more than 95 pounds, and after she 
gave birth to my brother, who was three years 
older, she was told never again to conceive 
because she had great problems with my brother. 
And somehow I -- I happened, and -- I had that 
from my gra ndmother. She was told by everybody to 
abort, to abort, to ab
ort, because she™d die 
in the process. And she said no, no, no, no, no. So
 I popped out, she surv
ived, but she was so 
weak she never recovered. And eventually, five
 years later she died of galloping pneumonia, 
because she had no strength left. So from -- 
Q: Galloping pneumoni a. 
A: Yeah, galloping pneumonia. She was gone in
 six weeks because she had no defensive 
mechanism left. 

Q: Oh -- 

A: And I was feeling guilty -- 

Q: -- so you were five years old. 

A: Sorry? 

Q: You were five years old when she di -- 

A: I was five years ol d, yeah, and I was feeli
ng guilty for ma ny years, because of my mother 
dying so soon and leaving me . The bi
g tragedy in my life was that.

A: Did your father rema rry? 
Q: You see -- my father eventually rema
rried, about 25 years later. Looking, looking, and 

looking from av -- as I was growing up he was 
always looking, and eventually found a woma n. 
Of all of the races in the world, he found a Ge
rman woma n and got ma rried to her in 1955. So 

from 1930 when my mom died, on the 14
th
 of May, he was not ma rried. 
Q: Yeah, so -- 

A: So he ma rried in 1955. 

Q: You were -- 

A: By that time he was a refugee, and having me t th
at Germa n in Austria, he decided to move to 
Germany. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because she had the job and he was still 
looking for a job, because he took refuge, you know, 
because -- 
Q: Right. 
A: Anyway, it was in Botos and 
we were living in Suboditsa in 
Szabadka and then we were 
living in Modbaskirk where my grandmother, my  
father™s mother, had all kinds of properties. 
But we originally come  from Ta me shwar. Tame s hwar is Romania. 

Q: Right.  

A: And after -- 

Q: That was where your father was born. 

A: That™s right, where my father was born in a 
village, a now big estate next to Tame shwar 
called Bukavitz. We  had a big, big horse sprea
d. [indecipherable] raisi
ng horses for racing and 
raising horses for the guard of the emperor. At 
that time  there was still an emperor before 1918.

In mi d 1918 with the Treaty of Trianon, that part
 of Austria-Hungary, Hungary fell to Roma nia. 
The second part fell to the so-called Yugoslavs, 
eventually it was lost. And the third part was 
retained by Hungary. And in 1941 when the N
azis attacked Yugoslavi
a, Hungary quickly 
recouped two of th
e three parts -- 
Q: That [indecipherable] right. 
A: -- including the Barcika, borders within th
e Barcika. So it reverted back to Hungary. 
Q: Right. 

A: So most of my education ex
cept three years, I have in H
ungaria. I had had no education in 
German whatsoever because we
 had nothing to do -- we we
re Hungarian bourgeoisie of 
Huguenot background. 

Q: And your father™s name  was Cornell? 

A: Cornelius, Cornell. 

Q: Cornell. 
A: Cornell Marie. 
Q: Cornell Marie. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And so he come s to -- 

A: And my grandfather™s name  -- 

Q: Yes? 

A: -- was Jean Joseph. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Still following the French tradition. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525

A: So my grandfather wa s sti
ll three-quarters French. My gr
andmother was Austrian-Germa n. 
She was Madame  Fultilga. Constantine Fultilga. 
And my mother was Hungarian, as Hungarian 
as they come . 
Q: And from Szeged.  

A: That™s right, from Szeged. 

Q: From Szeged. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Which was also small -- 

A: Oh, she was a tiny little lady, so I st
ill -- I me an, I™m a grown-up male -- 
Q: Do you reme mber -- do you reme mber her as a -- 

A: Sorry? 

Q: -- do you reme mber her as a child? 

A: I reme mb er my mo m, but I remember her main
ly very, very ill lying in bed, and ther e being 
pl -- less and less of her, except she had my face, 
she had dark eyes, dark hair and ki nd of -- I 
reme mber her nose becomi ng -- I didn't  know what 
it meant, dying, I mean I was five years old. 
Q: Right. 

A: But she was lying there and just suddenly 
she was just there, sh
e was dead. And I -- I 
reme mber about two or three weeks before she 
eventually died, she stood up and baked for me  
and my brother -- and there is a fru
it which is like a big pear, but it
™s not pear, they call it quitten 
in German. It makes marvelous jam, but it is 
not liquid jam, it is [i
ndecipherable] jam and you 
can cut it into slices, and it me lts on your tongue. 

Q: Really. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525

A: So she stood up for that, very painfully shewas doing that, with the 
helper, Sophie, was our 
lady for all purposes. She had been 
with the family for two generati
ons. It -- even at my time she  
already about 60 years old. She eventually died 
at about 92 or 93, she had always been in the 
fa mily. And she and my mom ma de t hat quitten [i
ndecipherable] they™d call it. And I grabbed it 
and sliced it up and brought
 it out to the street  to my -- for my fr iends -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- because it was a delicacy and I reme mber
 my mo m looking at me  with -- very sad I 
understand, but I [indecipherable] I ha -- I ma de 
that for you. And I just kept on smiling. And I 
was called, as a child, na turally 
in Hungarian, the smiling country. 
Q: The smiling country. 

A: Mosoly or szág. 

Q: Really? 

A: Mosoly ország, because before my mo m died I ha
d to smile just to cope with that problem of 
her illness, and after 
she died, my da d tells me  I was smiling at everybody, hoping that some body 
would touch me  and be good to me . 

Q: Oh. 

A: And Mosoly ország in Hungarian is a very
 poetic term. It doesn
™t exist in any other 
languages. Ország means world, country. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Mosoly means s miling. 

Q: Smile -- 

A: Smiling [indecipherable] 

Q: Smiling country. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
7 
 
A: And I still retain 
-- and my grandson, the s
econd son of my son -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- is exactly the same with the smiling. 

Q: Exactly the same  kind of -- 
were you close with your father? 
A: I was very close to my dad. My dad was 
sportsma n, a horsema n. He taught me  very early 
horsema nship and sportsma nship and I hit it off -- 

Q: So he was really -- 

A: -- really well with my dad. 

Q: You did. 

A: And my brother was more i
ndependent. Do-Don™t forget pleas
e that in the 1920™s and 30™s, 
fathers were absolute rulers in the family. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: As had been their fathers. And the father wo
uld count -- the mother™s words were listened to, 
but they nev-never really amounted to much, excep
t they had to be faithful to their -- to their 
husbands, right -- 

Q: To the husbands, yeah. 

A: -- rema in [indecipherable] ri
ght.And my father alwaysth
ought he knew exactly what my 
brother and I would have to do. My
 father kept on telling me  th
at I would have to become  a 
doctor of jurisprudence, and then I would have to 
go to the Hungarian mi nister of external affairs 

to become  a diplomat. And he was -- we had bi
g places in which to live. My brother the room 
and the bathroom, I had my room 
and my bathroom. And my room 
was the diplomat en zimmer.  
Q: Right. 

A: That me a ns the diplomat™s room. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
8 
 
Q: Right. 
A: My brother was the engineer™s
 room, although my brother had 
no interest in engineering at 
all, so he and my dad were always fighting a
bout. My brother was pigheaded, he was born in 
June, June 22
nd
, and he said, I want to be a me rchant, I 
want to be a me rchant, and I don™t want 
to be a -- my  dad said, but in ou-our family th
ere are no me rchants. And my brother said, well, 
we™ll see about that. And -- andI don™t know if you™re 
interested in that, 
but my poor brother 
ma naged school just barely, out of
 spite. He was very, very bri
ght. Wa s brighter than I would 
ever hope to be. And he barely st udied and some
how he ma de it, so with my father™s position, 
who eventually recognized that my brother was not qualified to be in the gymnasium. 

Gymnasium is the Hungarian term for universit
y preparatory, seconda
ry education, [speaks 
Hungarian here], you see. My brother was eventu
ally put into the [indecipherable] Akadémia, 
into the commercial academy, happy like a lark. Fell 
in love with his ma -- language teacher, did 
a no-no, was expelled from school, and promptly
 talked my fat her into getting him an 
apprenticeship in one of Austri
a™s famous coffee  peddling chains, Meiml, and becomi ng Meiml, 
M-e-i-m- l. Great coffee in Vienna. If you go to Vienna, go to a Meiml coffee shop, is to -- 

second to none. And they also sp
ecialize in special imports, fruit 
and vegetable imports from the 
tropics, so my brother™s dream was suddenly fulfilled. He was an apprentice, hi gh class evide -- 

Meiml is high class, hi gh class appr entice at 
Meiml and said eventually I™m going to take over 
the store. And I recall by the time  my brothe
r was around, what four -- 17 - 18 years old -- he 
was born ™22, so it must have been 1939 I thi
nk, right? Suddenly he kept on a pyramid great 
oranges, one at a time . And I was Baylor at hom
e . Baylor is annelbare,
 okay?  But baylor in 
Hungarian is much cuter, and annelbare sounds
 hard. Baylor is some body that you know of. The 

white one. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
9 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Baylor -- in Slavic Baylor means white 
collar, okay, so anyway -- and my pet name was 

Urchika. Urchika means the younger brother. The 
elder brother is called Bandiko. So when my 
brother came home -- 

Q: So who called you Urchika? 

A: Sorry? Urchika -- 

Q: Urchika. 

A: I was ur -- Urchika.  

Q: Urchika. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: And who called you that, your brother? 

A: My -- everybody. 

Q: Everybody. 
A: The whole fa mily, I was Urchika, and because
 it was a status symbol. I was the second son. 
The second sons had no rights, th
ey would inherit nothing. But they
 were cute [indecipherable] 
and the brother was Bandiko. Bandiko in Hungarian means the young [indecipherable] while he 
was growing up. At 15 - 16 he slowly became Bandi
, the one expecting to inherit everything -- 
Q: Every -- 

A: -- and therefore carry on the name s and the 
tradition, except he jumped off the tradition 
wagon, wanted to become  a me rchant, right? 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
10 
 
A: And he brought home, I have to say [indeciphe
rable] means, here you are, Urchika, a great 
orange for you. Oh I loved my brother. And then
 he fell in love. Whatever I knew, I was -- he 
was 19, I was 16. 
Q: 16. 

A: Totally innocent, unlike the 
boys and the girls today, I was just a dr eami ng little boy, wanting 
to work [indecipherable] 

Q: But he wasn™t so innocent. 

A: My brothe r was a bit more experienced. He go
t expelled from school because he fell in love 
with a -- there was a beautiful 
Hungarian teacher [indecipherable]
 she was teachi ng French and 
he was enchanted by her upper structure. And so
me where along the line, during the intermission, 
he [indecipherable] dared stick his hand up, and with the no-no. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Right?  
Q: So he was kicked out? 
A: But he eventually got [indecipherable] it was 
recognized as a juvenile
 prank, you see, and she 
kind of liked him, too. Anyway, he then fell in lo
ve with a Jewish girl. And that was some thing 
very serious. I reme mber her hair, it was so shin
y, dark jet black and bi
g, big, big, big eyes. And 
I think she was the love of his -- 
she would have been the love of
 his life. And that was in 1940, I 
reme mber, and suddenly I didn't get 
the oranges, she got the oranges 
Q: She got the -- 

A: [indecipherable] and then -- 

Q: So tell m -- 

A: So in the -- th-the Germans, or you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
11 
 
Q: Let™s go back a little bit. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Let™s go back to your -- your father. You said
 you -- that you were close to your father.  
A: My father -- my father was a confirme d mona rc
hist, Austria Hungarian style. He had been to 

the military academy, the -- like the Sandhurst
 equivalent  was in Vienna Neustadt. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And in Budapest, it wa s two stages, one year 
each, and he was second li
eutenant in 19 -- early 
1918. He fought in the first World War, a second 
lieutenant, and was hoping to have a career, 
because we had -- our family had had established 
solid linkages with the family, the royal family, 
with the imperial family because they were -- my
 fa mily was in horse breeding, especially horses 
to be picked from which the grenadie
r guard horses would be picked -- 
Q: I see, I see. 

A: -- for the guard of the Kaiser. 
And he was hoping to enter the -- th
e -- he was the only child of 
his grandmother, but the fifth child on my gr
andfather, because my grandfather, Lallier 
grandfather™s first wife died -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- after giving birth to -- 

Q: Four -- 

A: -- four children. 

Q: Right. 

A: And then he married -- my grandfather married my father™s mother, with whom sh -- sh -- he 

had only one child, my father. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
12 
 
A: And since the other four children were 
two daughters and two s
ons, they™d already by 
tradition taken on their professiona
l training. My father 
would have been the one to join the 
army, and become  a soldier, right? But he had al
so finished university, in
 terms of a law degree 
equivalent, but he never got a la
w degree. So he was a second 
lieutenant and the one disturbing 
news I hear, which had great infl
uence over him was that after H
ungary capitulated and the Béla 
Kun regime  took power, my father
 demilitarized, was still wearing 
the officer™s uniform without 
the insignia, was accosted by a bunch of commie s in
 the -- the central part of Budapest, was put 
up against the wall to be shot on the spot by th
e communists. And he tells me  the League of 
Nations representative, [indecipherabl e] Pallavi cini
, from Italy originally, happened to have been 
driving through and happened to witness the almost
 killing of my dad and some  other for mer 
officers, and saved him. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So my fa ther didn™t get shot. 
Q: Right. 
A: And eventually the Béla Kun regime  was -- wa
s defeated by Horthy -- not the nicest of all 
nice in the world, but hi ghly more -- much more 
acceptable to [indecipherable] traditionally than 
the commies ever would. My father became an avid communi st hater. All his life he wa s a 

communist hater, and especia
lly after the Soviets took power
. And during the second World 
War, be Tito taking power. And the Roma nians fall
ing to communis m. My father knew that we™d 
lose everything and we lost everyt
hing. We  lost the possessions in wa -- in -- in Roma nia, we lost 
the possessions in Hungary, albeit late in 1940, 
except for a villa. And do you know Hungary at 
all? Lake Balaton? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
13 
 
A: Lake Balaton used to have 
great, great inland sea. We  ha
d a beautiful little country house 
right on the lake, and lost everythi
ng what is not in Serbia today. A
nd we lost even one particular 
very i-important little doma in 
down on the Adriatic Sea. We  
lost everything. And the most 
painful loss was evidently the horse breeding, becau
se not only did we lose that, but with the 
Soviets advancing 1944, they destroyed the whole th
ing, it was just [indecipherable] in Roma nia, 
and stooped -- stole all 
the rema ining horses. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So we were left -- my grandmother was left
 only with two factories and one large estate, 
which we then lost to the Titoists.  

Q: So [indecipherable] 

A: So we are what we consider -- they
 would have called us
 higher bourgeoisie. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: In Hungarian terms. 
Q: So you were quite well off.  
A: We  were very well off, yeah, but that™s why -- that™s why you see -- 

Q: Yeah, but where were the hor -- wher
e were the horses?  I mean, why wa -- 
A: They were at Tame shwar. Tame s hwar -- 

Q: Tame sh war. 

A: -- is Tymi swar -- 

Q: Right -- 

A: -- today. 

Q: Right. 

A: And di -- whe -- and my dad was born on the 
Salas, the village by th
e name  of Bukavitz. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
14 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And the whole estate, the major 
estate of the horses was there. 
Q: Wa s that close enough to Botos so he would just -- 

A: Ah, no, no, no -- 

Q: It wasn™t. 

A: Oh, a -- about -- let™s see, no, but that
 would be about four hours car drive. 
Q: So what was he doing in Botos? 

A: He -- after the war, th -- we had a problem. 

Q: Ah no, dur -- bef-before. 

A: You me a n, after the fi rst World War. 

Q: Yes, after the first World War. 

A: It™s a very important question, that. 

Q: Yes. 
A: Hungary having disintegrated, and big part
s of Hungary having been chopped off, people 
living in the chopped off areas had 
to ma ke a choice of citizenshi
p. My father never wanted to 
give Austrian hi -- Austro-Hungarian citizenship, but Austro-Hungary didn™t exist any more. It 
was either Austria or Hungaria, or Roma nia, or 
-- they were still calling themselves the Kingdom 
of Serbs, Croats and Slavines. I think only in
 1929 did they became Yugoslavia. Never lovi ng 
each other, even killing each other 
in -- in Belgrade  Parliame nt -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- would you believe that?  Anywa
y, so he was traveling back and 
forth to try to take care of 

the estates, but with the esta
tes being in [indecipherable] because of expropriation rights, 
especially mi norities who had visibly rema ined Aust
ro-Hungarian in spirit. My father was one of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
15 
 
those traveling back and forth, who rema ined 
Austro-Hungarians committed to the crown that 
didn™t exist, committed to the [ind
ecipherable] in Budapest that didn™t exist, but lovi ng Horthy, 
because Horthy was claime d by the Hungarians to 
become the personal re
presentative of the 
crown, the Hungarians still hoping that
 one of the sons of Oto, the 
last Ka iser, would eventually 
be invited back in. Which never happened, right? 

Q: Right. 

A: So moving from one place to another, he some
times took jobs. He spoke his five or  six local 
languages, was [indecipherable] useful. So he wo
rked for awhile. For the Hungarians he worked 
in admi nistration. For the Romanian
s he didn™t work, he -- [whisper] 
Q: He said what? 

A: For the rom -- he™d never work for the Romanians. 

Q: The Romanians, 
he wouldn™t do that. 
A: Gossip has it that if you want to go to a re
ally corrupt country anyw
here in Europe, you don™t 
have to go further than Roma nia. 

Q: I see. 

A: Right?  And he also worked for the Serbs in Dubocka where I was born -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- you see. And his last post 
there was, from what I reme mb
er, was -- you know kuntai, a -- in 
the United St ates you have the states 
and the states have some divisions. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: Of the main subdivisions, of te -- 10 - 15 - 20,
 we lived just on one or two towns. And back 
home  did have a chief admi nist
rative [indecipherable] officer, wh
ich is called a landrat in 
Austria. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
16 
 
Q: Right. 
A: There™s no such title, but I would call him a 
-- a -- a legal offi cer, chief legal admi nistrative 
officer of the whole region, containing up to 20 v
illages of one or two towns. Th-That was his 
last job. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You see, and it qualified him as a civil serv
ant, but he never got any promotion, even though 
he was -- my dad was, intellectually, a very
 self possessed person. Highly trained -- you know, 
it™s in the blood afte
r all generation [indeciphera
ble] and some  of these [indecipherable] for some  
time bloome d forth a very fast thinker, very en
ergetic, great sportsma n, 
great writer. He thought 
he was great in everything, in
cluding his hating the communists.
 But his hatred of communists 
didn™t prevent us from l osing everything. I™ve lear
ned not to hate anythi
ng. But it™s easy if you 
have nothing, how can you -- you either 
hate everything or you hate nothing. 
Q: Did you grow up in Botos? 
A: I -- no, I was wa -- I think I gr
ew -- was in Botos three years, 
and then we also had a smaller 
place in a place where my mo m died. Where did 
she die? Parage, P-a-r-a-g- e. Parage in 
Hungarian, I don™t know what it means. I -- it™s ju
st a name  on that tiny village. We  had another 
place there and she was -- you know I -- wait now,
 I -- now I reme mber, actually. In Parage we 
had a house, several hectares of 
land and a -- a well 200 me ters deep. 
Q: That™s a lot. 

A: Now that™s a lot of da -- depth, right?  A
nd how do I reme mber that?  At me  -- watermelon 
time, our ma le servant, Ilya was his name , he 
was  a Slav, kept on lowering the watermelons 200 
me ters down in the rope to have them ice cold
 before bringing them up. And I reme mber that 
because my mom™ s illness was some how linked with 
that deep well, but I™ve neve r found to what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
17 
 
extent. I remember the water was enormously 
cold. My grandmother sometime splashed my 
brother and I. She was in that 
time there too. And I [indecipherab
le] frigid. So ma ybe -- did she 
take her bath in ice cold water, which Ilya ha
d just brought her in a some  -- some thing like that, 
she developed galloping pneumonia, she was gone. 
Q: Right. 

A: She died in Parage, she was buried in Parage. 

Q: I see, and swe -- 

A: Even though we had no linkages with Parage wh
atsoever except that little place, which we 
eventually lost. 

Q: Right. And after Parage, then where? 

A: After Parage we went to Brimuk, which is an
other Hungarian village in the Bauska. And from 
Brimuk he then -- he was transferred over, he we
nt back to Ta me shwar for two years, which was 
about ‚32 to ‚34, and then he we
nt back to our rema ining propert
ies in [indecipherable]. That was 
in the Barnot . Barcika is in the mi ddle, Barnot is to the east of that. 

Q: Right. 

A: [indecipherable] the Serbs call that Petrovgrad 
then, today they call it Zr enjanin, in which we 
had two factories. And those were, because of
 its -- this possession™s gr adual by the heir 
countries of parts of Hungary. We  ha d lost ever
ything in Romania and we 
had lost the thing over 
at the Adriatic, right? There still rema ined one
 house in Vienna, I reme mb er that in the 19 
district. And we rema ined within those two f
actories and those two f
actories were the last 
remnant because some -- some of the other possessions that we had had, because of the -- the -- 

the Great Depression. We  lost part of that 
because of the Great Depression, including 
participation a particular [i ndeci
pherable] if I remember, in Tame shwar. I think I even have a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
18 
 
photo of some thing that looks like a [indeciphe
rable] building. And so we were hanging onto 
those -- hanging onto thos
e two factories, but -- 
Q: And wha t  -- what -- what did those factories produce? 
A: They were -- one produced textiles and th
e other one producing va
lves and -- what do you 
attach valves to? Cylinders. 

Q: Cylinders. 

A: Valves and cylinders. 

Q: So there™s a vast network of -- 

A: It was a nast vetwork  

Q: -- [indecipherable] family -- 

A: -- of the capitalistic investme nt viable du
ring the course of the Austro-Hungarian empire, 
because it was a solidly established 32 million do
llar -- 32 million peoples™ market. And with the 
disintegration of all that
, the market potential had disappeared
. The Serbs would never trade with 
the Hungarians. Through Roma nians nobody would tr
ade because they never pay. The Austrians 
had no money left, so the whole system gradually disintegrated. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Like you™re hanging on your good -- then
 you could declare bankruptcy. All I 
[indecipherable] personally, what I 
saved from that is knowing how 
to ride a horse, even had my 
own horse for awhile, and me mories of what a great
 life it would have been
 if it hadn™t been for 

that st upid Hitler. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because we had -- we had -- you know, in choos
ing where to live, you recognize that people 
are people are people, and that people, bei
ng individualistic, have 
a right in their own 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
19 
 
nationhood. And one who believes that
 [indecipherable] if they believe they™re distinct enough 
and if they be lieve  that they can ma intain th
emselves without leeching off other countries, 
neighboring countries, then they 
rightly hold -- need a nationhood. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Right?  But in my fat her™s eyes, it was the empire or nothing. 

Q: I see. 

A: Right?  He never had any chance of any promotions anywhere, right?  And I think he left this 

whole area as a refugee because A, the commies would have gotten hi m, t hey™d have 

[indecipherable] right? He had a gran -- he had 
a mother who was a very distinguished lady of 
society, and she™s -- he just c
ouldn™t st-stand the risk
 of Tito Hungarian communis m getting hold 
of my grandmother. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know?  So he escaped to Austria and -- 
Q: With her? 
A: -- and [indecipherable] toward the end of the wa
r, and then eventually 
[indecipherable] he me t 
that German, fine looking. I think sh -- 
one -- she™s one of the few good Germans 
[indecipherable] she -- me t her, fell in love with
 her, had his mother with him all the time. Had 
enough me a ns to establish himself. And because of his languages and the legal training, he 

eventually won a post with the German federal 
governme nt. Now, I resented that very much. 
Actually, if you want to know some
thing really specific, my father was a -- a German speaking 
Austrian, speaking German like an Austrian, ju
st like me . But he has already established 
credentials at a time  whe n We st Germ
any neede d me n who would go through these 
Denazification rituals -- I call them rituals on pur
pose because some people thought that it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
20 
 
foolish because they let the big 
Nazis go and ritualize 
the little Nazis had never done anything to 
anybody. And my father was, for awhile, I think 12 months in the area of Bavaria, a 
Denazification judge. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now was  it that because he was known to beco
me -- been an anti-co
mmunist all his life and 
by 1947 the Cold Wa r had broken out?  Or was it becau
se of his special lega l knowledge, or was 
it because of his languages? 

Q: Right. 

A: But one way or the other he was the -- he
 was the -- the [indecipherable] local for 
Denazification president and he was doing that for 
11 months. And I -- I had difficulties with that 
because he was not a German. And difficulties w
ith the notion of his living in Germa ny. Why 
wouldn™t he have stayed in Austri
a?  And he said to me  -- we talk
ed about it several times after I 
found hi m, you see, because don™t forget 
I was prisoner of war for a year.  
Q: Right. 

A: British prisoner of war. So eventually I 
-- after they let me  go 
in August 1946, so I was 
putting in a lot of to finally -- finally I discove
red he was in [indecipherable] why do you have to 
go to Germa ny?  And he said, because I love her.
 I said, don™t you forget
 everything else?  Don™t 
you forget what has happened?  He says, in Au
stria communists lived -- the communists were 
right in Vienna and I™m -- I was afraid. They almo
st killed me  once, I wanted to be safe enough, 
and well, Germany was s a fe enough. So I visited 
him three time s in the course of 30 years. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I had my personal reasons for not feel
ing home  [indecipherable]
. She was a great lady, 
Edith, but my father and I didn™t -- you bu -- beau
tifully put -- said que
stion, my father and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
21 
 
were very close. Spiritual very close, me ntally 
very sharp, very close, sportsma nlike very close. 
And we were kind of principle
d. My brother was more a me rcha
nt [indecipherable] but live and 
let live. And we went -- we went 
apart because of that. And he al
so told me  -- I told him, look, 
I™ve had enough of this [speaks Hungarian] 
in Hungarian. [Hungarian] means real pig 
[indecipherable] I™m going to go to Canada
. Adalbert, you are the only one I have. 
Q: Right. 
A: Now it™s you who is number one. I said, so wh
at, because my broth -- well, your br other is 
dead. So I said, what do I do with that, I™m numb
e r  one, we have nothing left. He says, oh yeah, 
you have pride left, you have family tradition le
ft and you will do what I want you to do. So I 
said, what do you want me  to do?  You stay in Ge rmany, and go to university in Germany and try 

to become  a diplomat. Me?  A diplomat in the Ge
rman -- no. I said, Dad, no. I prefer anything to 
that. His eyes popped out and said [indecipherable] you want to emigrate?  You lose your 

civilization if you go to America. I says, oh real
ly?  Six months later I was [indecipherable] and 
he never talked to me  again for five years. 

Q: Wow. We have to change the tape. 

A: Very -- 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
22 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Let me go -- let me go back -- 
A: So I told you about my brother 
and h-he loved th
at Jewish girl. 
Q: Yes. 

A: And yeah, well, they forgot to me ntion. So 
the Germans, as  I said, just to update that 

[indecipherable] 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- April 1941, the Nazis came in, took possession of the Barnot, gave Ba rcika and Barnya 

back to the Hungarians. The bridges were alread
y built for the Hungarians, then we had to come 
in the Barnot , we were living in Mont bachkirche, and we were all waiting and I was already 

anticipating going to Budapest to study, because 
I finished my -- was about finishing my high 
school, very well finishing my high school. And 
suddenly the bridges were torn off and the 
Germans said, we will rema in occupiers of the Ba
rnot for the time  being. And that™s how that 
[indecipherable] division was crea
ted out of this -- that peas ant [indecipherable] w-we were 
called [indecipherable] all of a 
sudden. And within six months, the Jewish people disappeared. 

Q: From Barnot? 

A: Yeah, and from the world, yeah. And including th
e little raven, shiny haired beauty that  my 
br-brother wa s so terribly in love. How can I say 
terribly in love, delight
fully love  in with. And 
upon inquiring, my father told me  that he had lear
ned from the Germans that they were picked up 
for their better safekeeping. Put up in some  bric
k factories, usually. The ma in brick factory was 
in Poncho, which was Ponchoway in Hungarian, ju
st off the -- off the Danube river, on the -- 
north of the Danube river, from whe nce they su
ddenly disappeared around September, October 
1941. And we never heard of the [indecipherabl
e] again. But we had not heard anything, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
23 
 
shooting or gassing or anything, th
ey were just gone, you see. [ind
ecipherable] was the first case 
of a ma ssive enleve mon, in French. Enlevemon means the picking up en ma sse and they 
transpor t them, carting them away
 [indecipherable]. But not the Je
ws were first ones to have 
been -- how do I know that?  My father had, wherev
er -- whenever he was in Bachkirche, he had 
a card round. Every Tuesday night
 they were playing cards, on
e of the four guys, four guys, 
everything. They were drinking, 
they were smoki ng, they were banging the table like the way 
me n were supposed to do to [indecipherable]. 
One of them wa s a mathe ma tics teacher by name 
of -- by nam-ame-a me -- by the name of Frankel,
 he was a Jewish guy. And he always ma naged 
winning. It ma de my fat her very
 angry. But they kept on playi
ng for years. Now how do I know 
that?  I was the one serving them the wine. 

Q: I see, right. And he used to take it -- 

A: And then Frank -- Frank was a great ma th t
eacher, was my math teacher. He had the ge -- 
built me -- geometric mo dels from potatoes. He br
ought in a potato, cut off it™s last thi -- see, you 
see what an arc is? You see -- 
you see, you can measure that along 
-- he loved it. He in my mi nd 
was a very influential creator of curiosity. 

Q: Right.  

A: He was [indecipherable] 

Q: So why don™t you -- when you -- let™
s go back to when you were a kid. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What did you like in school?  You liked ma thematics. 

A: I like -- oh, I -- I l
oved every -- I™m a linguist by -- by --
 by -- by -- by -- by [indecipherable] 
by-by -- by birth. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
24 
 
A: And I love ma the matics. I™m a great chess player. 
Q: Really? 

A: I™m told I™m an A level chess pl ayer. 

Q: Great. 

A: I know I am. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I never joined a chess club because I hated the smoking and drinking -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you see. And I -- I was the Magill champi
on ping pong two times in a row, was Magill 
chess champion two times, it was an unusual combination. 

Q: Right. 

A: Ping pong and chess have nothing to do with each
 other. I love -- my father introduced me  

into -- you know how I survived the wa
r?  I knew how to take care of my body. 
Q: You knew how to take care of your body? 

A: Yes. You want to have  a confession? Neve
r engaged in any se -- any sexual relation until I 
was 22 and a half. Why? 

Q: And you think that helped, why? 

A: Why?  Because so ma ny guys in the war decima
ted, they were pulled back from the front, the 
first thing they did, half dead, pul
led back from t he front, went to the whorehouses. So they were 
always caught in between having [indecipherable]
 because the food was al
so terrible. And yet 
they lined themselves up. For miles they were li
ned up for a whorehouse of five or six or seven 
wome n, right?  Horrendous experience. When I saw 
this at ma  -- I won™t have to do anything 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
25 
 
with that . And then I met my -- my potential fi
rst wife, for whom I saved myself, and who had 
saved myself unknowing for me. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we got ma rried to each 
ot her in Vienna, right, in 1948. 
Q: 1948? 

A: Totally innocent. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And yet loving each ot her, believing we 
just couldn™t live without each other. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And she said -- I said, but what do we do now
, after the wedding reception, she said, just let -- 
in Hungarian, lets nature take its course. 

Q: That is sweet. 

A: Had two babies with my
 wife, you know. He nrietta. 
Q: And was she Hungarian? 

A: She was German spe a king. 

Q: She was German spe a king? 

A: Yeah, that™s right. Her grandmother was Hungarian. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But her father was German Volksdeutsche, 
yeah. And I ma rried her in Vienna. And -- and I 
must also say she was blonde, blue eyed, which is 
curious for me  because when I was destined or 
selected to go on officer™s traini
ng in the Wa ffen SS, there still wa
s a requisite that to be a real  
Waffen SS officer you had to be blonde, blue eyed. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
26 
 
A: And [indecipherable] 80, and all those things. 
And I was just the opposite of that, looking like 
a Gypsy amongst all those blondes. And I had 
to go to a special commission, a racial 
investigation commission. [indeci
pherable]. And they looked at me  and said, you don™t qualify, 
just the color of your hair, the 
color of your eyes. And th-the ot
her said, but we need young ma n 
who knows ports and have been in the war [inde
cipherable] anything?  So they checked my -- 
they checked my protruding 
brain, oh good brain capacity. 
Q: I see. 
A: Why would Adolf worry about good brai
n ca -- brain capacity [indecipherable] good, 
impressive brain capacity, fine bone structure. 
Too French, but with a 
bit of training, the bones 
will be okay. Fine muscle structure, but his 
outside looks have  to be improved upon. So they 
passed me  with the condition that within three or
 four years I™d have 
to marry a light blonde 
German. 

Q: I see. 
A: With whom I would have to procreate four 
children, watch this one, one of whom would be 
purely bl onde, an improveme nt of the race. Anothe r one would be half blonde, also an 
improve me nt, but two would rema in hopeless, 
they said. Hopelessly non-German looking. 
Q: [indecipherable] non-German looking, right. 

A: And it was th --  several times in my life in 
those -- those terrible three years in which I was 
really feeling abused and angry, as I said, who are they to tell me  what kind of woma n I should 

ma rry?  I mean it -- you know, this was really tr
espassing upon my personal is -- guess what?  I 
was released from POW camp, ma de 
it to Vienna as fast as possibl
e to go back to school, right, 
at the university because I™d ha
d my gymnasium,  right? And who 
do I see at the -- round street  
corner just ma rching away, a little
 blonde kid with her mother. A
nd I look in the [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
27 
 
went around the corner, never ha
d a [indecipherable]. Some thing compelled me  to trace myself 
back [indecipherable] and that was 
that little blonde blue-eyed kid. 
Q: Really? 
A: My two children are blonde blue eyed. 

Q: Blonde and blue eyed. 

A: My looks have improved. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But, by my voluntary c
hoice, that™s different. 

Q: That™s different. When you were raised, we
re you raised as a Cat
holic or Protestant? 
A: I was raised by my gr andmother going to Cath
olic church, but on Prot
estant principles. She 
said, we have to go to church, there is no Protes
tant church in the area, but we pray to the 
Protestant God [indecipherable] 

Q: Wa s that confusing to you? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: No -- 

Q: You knew exactly what it meant? 

A: -- no, to me  -- to me  -- you could -- what app ealed to me , you could stand up tall and raise 

your eyes to the heavens and talk
 to your God, hoping to talk to -- 
directly by talk to. To me  the 
pope was not essential. 

Q: I see. 

A: To me -- because I had to learn the little 
catechism, you know the catechism?  Catechism was 
what the pope wanted us to believe, not letting 
us be free to choose what
 we wanted to believe. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
28 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So I had no use for the catechism. 

Q: So -- 

A: And between the two of us, I™m
 very critical of the 10 command
ments, that they were -- the 
way they were spelled out. 

Q: I see. 

A: But we have a personal responsibility to
 God, but it also gives us the right and the 
[indecipherable] to ask, God, where are you? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Didn™t talk to me . So -- 

Q: So, did you ti -- 

A: -- don™t ask me  questions about re
ligion, I™m -- at the present time -- 
Q: But when you were raised as a kid -- 
A: Re -- organized religion is 
an organized attack by the ones 
who know how to use people, to 
brainwash people -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- for self profiteering purposes. It™s a 
dismal use, dismal you -- it™s not right.  
Q: But you didn™t have this -- 

A: And wha t  was happening with Ca tholic cl
ergy is just atrocious [indecipherable] 
Q: But you didn™t feel this as a kid. 

A: No, as a -- as a kid I wa
s -- I was happy to stand tall. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because my -- my gr andmother was an indivi dualist. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
29 
 
Q: So did you -- did your grandmother sort of take over -- 
A: She had -- yeah -- yeah -- 

Q: -- partly raising you after your mo ther passed? 

A: -- and after my mo m died, my grandmother 
was the ruling infl uence in our lives, but too 
much e mphasis on discipline -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- too much emphasis on tradition, but great emphasis on respect for ladies. 

Q: I see. 

A: Obviously ladies -- 

Q: Wa s this your mother™s mother, or your father™s mother? 

A: My father™s. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Oh yeah, she was a lady of stature. 
Q: Okay. 
A: As my grandfather wouldn™
t have ma rried her, you see. 
Q: Right. 

A: She says [indecipherable] Bayl
or, you have to ma ke sure to l
earn how to distinguish between 
a lady and just an ordinary woma n. Trouble is, in 
Vienna, the ladies were in the [indecipherable] 
district, the ordinary wome n 
were in the second district. 
Q: See, that™s the only wa y you -- 

A: And she said, eventually she 
said, there is nothing wrong learni
ng how to -- going to the girls 
in the second district. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
30 
 
A: I never did. 
Q: Right. You never did -- 

A: But she would -- and my grandmother hired tw
o professional educators.
 I was six years old, 
my brother was nine years old, th
at we had had for about seven y
ears each. One of them was six 
foot some thing, big moustache, le
gs like that and she didn't like 
my jump y attitude. I was a fast 
learner, I wanted to learn fast, 
to play game s fast, and eventually it was so bad she couldn™t corre 

-- she tied my legs to the chair 
[indecipherable] onto th
e chair, said you will now sit for an hour 
because I want you to sit for an hour and do exac
tly what I want you, I said, but I™ve already 
finished. That™s not the is-issue. 
You have to follow me , you have 
to -- I am the one to educate 
you, to bring you up, therefore, you have to learn disc
ipline. Oh, I hated her.
 And then -- but -- at 
night she sa id, never go out in the dark, because
 there™s a guy waiting for you with the knife. She 
was terrified of the dark. Eventually my 
father let her go. The other woma n was okay. 
Q: So does this mean you -- 
A: The other woma n was  a lovi ng girl, a loving woma n by the name  of Anna Fayis, also 
complete -- very Hungarian. She really ma de a 
Hungarian out of [indecipherable]. She was from 
-- she was also from Szeged, right. Blonde woma n, 
she was an educator, very tough but very fair, 
and very decent. She didn't  mi streat us. But sh
e was almost like a mother substitute, except my 
father was loafing around, so she could kind of
 not handle my father, 
you see [indecipherable]. 
But she was a very strong influence and she surv
ived the war and went back to Hungary and I 
corresponded with her until 1963, when she died. 

Q: So did this -- 

A: And from her -- her, I was able to re
trieve some  of thos
e photographs there. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
31 
 
A: Because she had somehow ma naged to save so me  of the things that the commies had taken 
out.  

Q: Some  of the photographs, right. So di
d this mean you didn™t go to school? 
A: Sorry? 

Q: Thi -- thi -- did this mean you didn™t
 go to school, that you were home -- 
A: No, no, no, I didn™t -- no, I -- I did go --  

Q: You went to school as well? 

A: -- I greet -- did go to a high, 
high -- the Hungarian school was 
a very [indecipherable] school. 
I have a ma triculation -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- from a Hungarian secondary school, 
which was a good enough school to give me 
immediate admi ssion to the uni
versity in Budapest -- 

Q: I see. 
A: -- which was the mos t  famous uni versity, [i
ndecipherable] university
 in Prague, and the 
Vienna University in Austria. 
Q: Right. 

A: And eventually, after I was released from pr
isoner of war, I went to Vienna with that 
certifi cate, I was admitted immediately to the -- 

Q: To that school, right. 

A: -- university to study, guess what, 
law. I always told my father, I don™t want to study law, I 
don™t want to study law, I don™t 
want to study diplomacy, I wa
nt to study [indecipherable] 
political science. He said, you will study la
w [indecipherable]. So eventually I took -- 
Q: So you stayed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
32 
 
A: -- took up law and political science, but th
en I dropped law, I found law -- law is boring.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Anyway, I have a very good -- 

Q: But you liked st -- 

A: -- high school condition. 

Q: -- but you liked studying as a kid. 

A: Oh, I love -- I loved studying because, first of
 all, my brain was very flexible. I don™t know 
whether it™s that French stimulus
 or a Hungarian -- it™s a -- some  
kind of a mi x of the French and 
the Hungarian that keeps you ju
mping all the time. Everybody says, Lally, your me tabolism is 
fantastic. You never sit back a
nd do nothing. Absolutely right. 
Q: Right. 

A: Now, what I know is what nobody else knows.
 You know why I always keep on jumping?  
When the Germans marched into Austria -- Aust ria 
was a leisurely people. On the whole most of 
them are good-willed people, they™re
 a lot of fun, kind of like the Fr
ench is and the -- the Italian. 
So they went Nazi for awhile because they need
ed jobs and ma ybe because of Hitler and all that, 
but on the whole they are a more leisurely people
 than the ever -- the Germans would ever hope 
to be. The Germans quickly built [indecipherable] 
and mortars into the be
hinds of every one of 
us, right, to make us mo ve like the Germans. 
I think they forgot to
 take one out. Keeps on 
ma king me  j u mpy. But I was a good student and a very 
-- I loved the Latin. At that time  they still 
had six years of Latin, four years of Greek, a
nd I loved the -- the -- the classicists. Greek 
mythology has great significant in 
my  life. I really believe in 
Venus. I also believe in Pallas 
Athena because to me  the ideal lady is a comb
ination of Venus and Pallas Athena, you see. 
Brain-wise and otherwise. And also
 loved game s, so in order to be
 able to do everythi ng within

the constraints of a disciplinary upbringing, I had to
 be fast in learning to
 get away from those 
ropes. 
Q: To get it -- right, right.  

A: And how to be good at sports, to have an [i
ndecipherable] with my da d, that was kind of de-
emphasizing studies, he really want ed to just pl
ay soccer, obviously, being a left wing and the -- 
in the high school soccer team, also playing soc 
-- ping pong and also playing chess. My father 
taught me  how to play chess. After two years he
 stopped, he said, I can™
t stand it any more, you 
keep on winning all the time . Very [i ndecipherabl
e]. So I was a fast learner and with the 
languages, you grew up with the Hu
ngarian and with the Slavic, a
nd with the Roma nian and with 
the German and with the -- whatever French ther
e had been in the family still [i ndecipherable] 
my -- my gr andmother, father™s mother always ca
lled an umbrella a parapree. A strange term in 

Austria, right? But that ™s the way it was, so 
I wer -- grew up with five languages and I still 
commanding -- have added to that English and so
me Russian because when I was at Columbia 
University I was taken up into a special pr ogram
 in which my  capacities, like music capacities, 
will be br ought to full bloom by [i ndecipherable] 
and they --  they were going to employ me  by 
the Rand Corporation to become  a -- some  kind 
of a spy about eastern Europe, understandably 
so. The Americans want to pick 
the brain that can instantaneously
 prove useful. They knew, the 
Americans, about my forced induct
ion in that, but th-they forgave me . And I have to tell you that 
-- 

Q: Right, right -- 

A: -- that ™s a latter 
part of the story. 

Q: -- you™re right. So you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
34 
 
A: I -- I loved studying. But back 
home  the limits of studying wa
s within the context of your 
socioeconomi c structure. You needed to know
 how to understand that, but don™t worry about 
things outside of that. It was not universal educ
ation. It was parochial [i
ndecipherable] e mpire in 
U.S. education. The Kaiser is on the top and you 
always have to bow to them. Some where along 
the line I dropped that. Why do I have to bow to a Ka
iser if I don™t have to 
bow if I want talk to 
God? And Canada and Magill broadened my attitu
de to beco me a Universalist attitude, the 
essential foundation being peace among huma ns. 
Q: Right. 

A: Because all humans have red bl ood. It ma kes no 
sense at all to shed human lifes, or -- blood is 

equally red, why -- why -- why shed 
it?  That™s -- that™s me  today. 
Q: Was there a lot of raci sm and anti-Semitism when -- 

A: Oh no -- no -- 

Q: -- when you grew up? 
A: -- the -- the -- in the Hungarian society, th
e -- the austro -- the Austro-Hungarian empire 
during the reign of Franz Joseph 
the second promoted Jewish peopl
e to very visible posts in 
industry, even in banking [indecipherable] for 
exam -- we had the Austria branch of the 
[indecipherable]. And they even gave them bari
sees exceptionally with 
appropriate financial 
payments. If we wanted [indecipherable] graf, 
a count, you had to pay th
ree times more than 
you™d had to pay. But there were quite a few very successful Jewish businessman who had 
become  barons and were living -- 
and their ladies -- living a [indeci
pherable] lifestyles, with free 
entry to the [indecipherable] and 
to all the privileges, to parlia
me nt and all that. But amongst the 
masses, especially in the east, the mo st part  there was there the [indecipherable] ther e was 

always greater anti-Semitism.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
35 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: The Hungarian peasantry was very anti-Semitic
. That™s an issue that ha sn™t been fully 
explored yet. The Jewish people,
 the Jewish potentates,
 I call them potentate
s in Hungary, right, 
they were not enemies of Hungarian ordinary pe
asants, because the peasants were living in a 

feudal system. The big enemies of Hungarian pe
asants were the Hungarian aristocrats. The 
Hungarian aristocrats were explicitly anti
-Semitic, unlike the Viennese aristocracy. 
Q: Yes -- 

A: You see, by then, any feudal system, reme mbe r
, five, 600 years ago had its basic principles 
resting on the Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have
 to exterminate the Jews and we have to keep 
them in place. We have to let them prosper then
 we ™ll rob them blind. So a necessary evil, it has 
to be fully controlled. That is a feudal system
. With the enlightenment period, this emphasis on 
the Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have to 
kill the Jews has disappeared [indecipherable] in 
particular in Italy, and of course
, particularly amongst the more educated classes of the German 
speaking Protestants, right?  But the Catholics 
were hanging onto that 
well until [indecipherable], 
it™s the truth, you see, so you™re raised in a si
tuation like that, you see Frankel, the ma thematic 
teacher  playing a -- pl easurably yelling as mu
ch and drinki ng as much, and I-I knew he was 
Jewish, but he was me mber of a group, of an 
in-group of the higher bourgeoisie, and behaving 
like it too. Li ke the guys had all th
e rights, the guys have all the 
powers. They could mi sbehave, 
they can be drunk, right?  Get into
 all kinds of mi schief and yet 
they were excused because they 
are me n, and presumed to be just. 

Q: But was there a -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- was there a di fference in class? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
36 
 
A: Sorry? 
Q: So if your father would think ab
out a different class of Jews -- 
A: Ah well, the -- the -- no, no, the -- the -- we ne
ver knew of the existence 
of just the ordinary 
poor Jewish people who were Orthodox. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We  were with the cultured Jewish people. 
Li -- never brought up 
the question in my  mi nd, 
except ma ny years after the second World Wa r of
 how much discrimi nation there must have 
been between the Jewish 
people who had arrived -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- in the uppermost classes and 
the little Orthodox bearded ones st
ill living in th
e villages in 
Poland and Hungary. I reme mber one instance in Ne
w York City, I™ll tell you 
about that later on. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: A Mr. Rosenberg. 
Q: Okay. 
A: You mus t  have heard that name  Rosenberg, on
e of the greatest [indecipherable] in New York 
City ever, who was a German Jew, who was able to
 get away with special 
arrangements with the 
Nazis, with all of his paintings
, set hims elf up in New York Cit
y, right?  Ha d a glorious daughter, 
brought -- bringing her up on the -- on the west side, right? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Bringing her up in the -- spoke 
only -- he was Prussian German. As Pr ussian German as any 
Prussian German would want to be, brought up 
his daughter in America speaking the Prussian 

German accent. I met her when I was at Columbia University and living in International House, 

she was a frequent visitor because  she had a guy
 there that she knew, was -- she was musically 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
37 
 
inclined. His daughter fell in love with the cr
eator of the song, the bootsare for -- the boots are 
for -- 
Q: Marching, or [indecipherable] 

A: -- stomping, or the boots ar
e -- anyway, the guy who wrote 
that was a little Jewish guy 
[indecipherable] from Poland. Eventually brought 
the guy home to introduce the guy to his father 
as the potential fiancé, he, the father, the Germ
an Jew from Prussia kicked him out saying, this 
rabble, my daughter will neve
r ge -- never get ma rried.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Brought up [indecipherable] but to answer your
 question, class-wise, if
 you™re at a certain 
elite leve l, Je wish or not, ma de no difference at 
all, just  like in England. There are in British 
parliame nt from Jewish lords, I know, successful
 bankers, successful businessmen who I know. 

Q: So you were not raised in 
the situation -- 
your -- your -- 
A: No, I was not in a situation in which you w
ould say a Jew is all good or bad. We  didn™t know 
about the poor Jews in Poland. 

Q: But -- 

A: They were simply nonexistent. And the ones that
 are socially acceptable,
 they were just like 
everybody else. 

Q: But when you™re a early teen -- 

A: And you know what™s an interesting thing? 

Q: Yeah? 

A: The Jewish people that I knew 
of a certain rank, they were H
ungarian nationalists, or Austrian 
nationalists, or Serbian na
tionalists or Roma nian nationalists, 
even though they were Jewish. But 
the Hungarian Jews was really Hungarian. 
What else could they be?  So la -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
38 
 
Q: When you say they we re nationalists -- 
A: Sorry? 

Q: -- what do -- what do you -- what do you mean
 when they -- when you say they were 
nationalists -- 

A: Well, they -- they are -- 

Q: -- do you mean -- 

A: -- the -- the -- the -- Hor -- 
the -- Horthy™s regime  was very much in support of Hungarian 
Jews. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You see? By the way, the interesting statistic is
 also Béla Kun was a Jewish Hungarian, but he 
had gone communist. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So ma ybe he had gone communist because 
he thought that some body had to do some thing 
liberational for the little Je
wish people who were poor, ba
rely living in the modern 

[indecipherable]. I know -- I never studied that, but 
th-the -- a very serious question arose in my 
mi nd some years ago, and I been 
looking at that. I have caught in
 Vienna ma ny years ago when I 
was visiting a display of Austrian
 Jews who had per -- been pers
ecuted by the Nazis, who had 
disappeared, who had been killed. As again, the 
Austrian Jews had been
 able to get away. 80 
percent of the Austrian Jewish intelligentsia 
was allowed to get away. The poor Austrian Jews, 
literally al most all of them perished. 

Q: Cause they couldn™t leave. 

A: [indecipherable] because they were not able to get away. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
39 
 
A: But at the same  time, seems like it™s some  kind of an imba lance. How come  Rosenberg was 
able to get away with everything, and tens
 of thousand of poorly Jews are killed? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It just -- some thing is lack
ing there, som- some  feeling of 
responsible -- responsibility is 
lacking. 

Q: Did you feel a change once Hitler became ch
ancellor in Germany in ™33?  Did something 
change in Hungary? 

A: We ll, they were all [indecipherable] they we
re all -- except -- excep
t for the ones who were 
caught as having been anti-Hitler, those who had 
been able to get away
 anyway, right, to the 
anti-Hitler areas. But the ones who stayed inside
, mostly they were caught and executed. The 
others were solidly ma rching, e-ev
en the Austrian. He gave us j
obs, he is wa -- our own li-life 
and blood. He gave us hope, he is keeping the co
mmies away and Cardinal Innitzer, who was the 
chief Cardinal of Austria during --  at the beginnin
g of Hitler™s era, I remember the ma in plat z of 
Vienna -- the ma in platz, the ma in square of 
Vienna, the -- the German troops, including the 
Austrian divisions were lined up, waiting for th
e blessing of Innitzer, which bri Œ Innitzer 
willingl y and happily gave them, sending them to eastern fr ont to save us fr om -- civilization 

from -- from the godless communists. 

Q: But what -- 

A: And they were ma rching in line because the Ca
tholic church officially never disa pproved of 
Hitler. 

Q: Mm-hm. But what did you feel li
ke as a kid? What -- what you -- 
A: I was a kid when Hitler came to power -- 

Q: Right, you were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
40 
 
A: -- it was 1933, I was eight years old -- 
Q: Right -- 

A: -- I didn™t know anything about anything -- 

Q: Right, but when you became -- 

A: At 16 -- 16, my ma in preoccupation was to 
get as a student to Budapest and study in 
Budapest. And then in terms of 
my -- the original ideas, join 
the Hungarian external affairs 
departme nt, become  a Hungarian diplomat. 

Q: Right, I™m -- I understand that, right. 

A: And everything else I have no concern 
for. The Germans were far away, I -- 
Q: But aren™t things ha -- aren™t thing happeni
ng in -- in Hungary, even though the Germans have 
not -- 

A: Oh, the -- the --oh yes, the -- one the thing 
I reme mber, everybody in the late -- in the mi d and 
late 30™s, every ma n was  suddenly wearing so
me  kind of a unifor m. And e verybody wearing a 
uniform, ma rchingtogether, were
 trying out yell everybody else. 
There were no weapons. There 
were just brutal encounters and -- between 
the uniforme d communists, uniformed bl ackists, 
which was the Austrian National Tr aditional party, and the uniformed retro -- the socialists, but 
not as red as the commun
ist redshirts, right?  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They were beating each other up, and then th
e Austrian Nazis, the br
ownshirts rounding them 
up. There was a me lee in the streets virtually a
ll the time, especially 
1935 - ™36 - ™37, when 
Dollfuss was assassinated, right? 
Wh ere the Nazis were -- become  nume r ous enough to want to 
take power by force, right?  Everybody is -- were 
out in the street yelli
ng and qui -- and -- an-and 
beating each other up. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
41 
 
Q: And wha t ™s happening to you and your friends? 
A: To?  

Q: I mean -- to you and your friends. 

A: To me  and my friends -- 

Q: I -- I mean, I -- ar e -- is
 -- is there something -- 
A: -- well, I was then -- I was then in my -- Mo
tsbachkiruk was like a litt
le peaceful enclave. 
You mustn™t forg -- we mustn™t forget that
. A northern -- southern Hungary and northern 
Yugoslavia and westernmost Romani
a were an agricultural society. 
In an agricultu
ral society you 
have three or four intelligentsia on the top, like the ones who run the district [indecipherable] 

education. You have then the professional groups
, you had -- and then you have the me rchants, 
and then you have the priests and then you have
 the peasants, right? A
nd they™re all kind of 
falling in step with the needs of an agricultural 
society. Rebirth in -- in 
March, April, planting the 
crops, gathering the crops, having 
the crops gathered in September,
 having a great feast, all of 
them drinking themselves to death and then st
opping for the winter and waiting for the renewal 
on following March. International ha ppenings like
 Hitler and communism, 
they™re too far away 
to worry about, except the me mbers of the intelligentsia and of the property class. My father was 

always worried about the communists taki ng away everyt hing. He didn't worry about Hitler. 

Q: But the -- 

A: Because Hitler™s system was a cap
italist system. State capitalist system. 
Q: Mm-hm. So he didn™t worry about it. 

A: Right? Hitler would only dispossess people if
 they became anti-Hitlerian, but he will let 
German capitalists prosper, just look at the 
Krups and all the others
, how rich they got. 
Q: Mm-hm. Okay, let™s change the tape.

End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: I think when we were stopping I was as
king you about anti-Semitism in Hungary -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and whether it was class ba
sed. Do you recall some  of the la
ws tha-that Hungary started 
promulgating against the Jews in ™38 and ™39? 

A: After -- no. No, hu -- no, unde
r how -- hung -- under -- for a while
 -- well, I was very young 
then, but I was aspiring to go to -- 
to university in 
Budapest. I -- 
Q: No, I™m j ust asking if you reme mber -- 

A: -- I do not recall -- 

Q: You don™t recall. 

A: -- I don™t -- do not recall any quote unquote an
ti-Jewish laws before the Germans would 
gradually force Horth-Horthy into doing 
that. And that would have been 1943 - 1944. 
Q: So you don™t -- you don™t recall the -- the laws that were restrict
ing Jewi sh professions, or -- 
A: No, I don™t recall that. 

Q: Right.  

A: I don™t recall that. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I do recall laws of ma rginalization in whic
h Hungary insisted that every non-Hungarian name  
and person carrying that name  shoul
d, just like in French [indeciphe
rable] that, and adopt to the 
national language, the la
nguage of the nation. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: And in the course of that change 
their name  to a Hungarian sounding name. 
Q: Right. But you don™t -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
44 
 
A: And ma ny of the Jewish people were
 then taking on Jew -- Hungarian -- 
Q: Hungarian name s. 
A: -- sounding name s.  

Q: I see. Okay, but you don™
t recall [indecipherable] 

A: So what did they do? Instead of calling Ki
rschbaum, they called themselves the Hungarian 
equivalent of Kirschbaum, you see? 

Q: What did they say? 

A: Kir-Kirschbaum is a cherry tree. 

Q: I see. 

A: Right?  Would have been a typical name , you s ee. 

Q: I see. 

A: You see. But I don™t -- not before -- I thi
nk it was only 1943 I think, th
at the Nylas party, the 
Hungarian Arrow Cross -- 
Q: Right, Arrow Cross party, right. 
A: -- oh, what was the guy™s name ?  I™ll reme mb er the name  in a mi nute. The Nylas party 

emerged and with the Nylas party emerging, unde
rwriting Hitler™s anti-J
ewish policies, right? 
Q: Right. 

A: It coul d ne ver been a Nazi party because Hung
arians don™t qualify as -- as ethnic Ge rmans, 

right, right? 

Q: But the Arrow Cross part -- right. 

A: The Nylas party [indecipherable] the Nylas 
party, eventually they took power. Then the 
ma ssive edicts against the Jewish populati
on, leading to the whol
esale -- wholesale 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
45 
 
transportation to the camps in 1944, was very
 viciously started and conducted. And the 
Hungarian gendarmerie were a very, very
 important factor 
in rounding them up. 
Q: Right. Were you reading the newspapers when you were growing up? 
A: Yeah, I-I was reading newspapers, yeah. 

Q: But not a lot. 

A: Well -- well yeah, I was reading the sports pages a lot. I st ill --  I st ill reme mber the three 

Hungarian gold me dal winners at the 1936 Olympics. Che -- 

Q: Really? 

A: Oh yeah, the three of them. In swi mming, 
and -- on the 100 me ter swimming, in the discus 
throwing [indecipherable]. Oh, I was also ta
ught by the 1928 Olympia me dal -- gold medal 
winner in the saber, I was taught how to fence. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. So [indecipherable] 
Q: So in ™36 you™re only 11 years old? 
A: Yeah, but they 
-- you start early. 

Q: But you -- you™re paying attention. 

A: You start early, yeah. 

Q: So did -- 

A: I reme mb er -- I remember the names in sports. 
I reme mb er some  na mes in -- in politics, but 

I™d -- I don™t reme mber before 1939 - ™40, I don™t re
me mber having read intensively international 
politics. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
46 
 
A: Because as I told you, peasant society, we were
 well off. We had saved the two factories, we 
were giving jobs. My granny was 
contented. I was having my regular vacations in our house in 
[indecipherable] had seen that lit
tle Hungarian girl, kind of feeli
ng more and more like a little 
guy growing up and I was watching my br
other. It was a 
nice little life. 
Q: Was a -- right, and it was a 
bit protected in some  ways. 
A: And I had the possibility of eventually landing in Budapest if I get a job -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and acting like typical Hungarian [indecipherab
le] a ma n of the -- not saloons, ma ns of the -
- the -- the ball scene. 

Q: Right. Did you go to the movies?   

A: I did go to the movies, and -- 

Q: Did you like the movies? 

A: -- I -- well, the one movie I saw, I was about 
11 years old [s peaks Hungarian here]. The boys 
of [indecipherable] in Budapest, which was a trag
ic story of a Hungarian little girl from the 

village, typical of feudal societ y, desperately wanted to get away, getting away fr om this to the 

city, working in a textile factory, and being ra
ped by the forema n. And I had no idea what that 
meant, I was 11 years old, but they showed the various scenes in which he was kind of being 

very crude and rude to her and I burst out cr
ying. And then the little 
boys got together, having 
heard of that, and decided to b
eat up the bastard [i ndecipherable] 
Q: The -- 

A: Beat up the ma n who did it to her. 

Q: Uh-huh, who did it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
47 
 
A: And he gave her after the fact, just a bar of
 soap, and she looked totally destroyed. And that 
movie I thought will shatter my heart. I felt so
 terri ble about any man doing something like that 
to a little girl, in a setting which I was raised
 to believe again that little girls from the good 
fa milies are untouchable until you are ma rried to
 them. There™s nothing wr ong with the little 
girls in the second 
district, you see. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I broke out crying. My dad was in the m
ovie, he pulled me  out and said, boys don™t cry 
about things like that. I didn™t re
ally understand what it was about, 
but -- and -- but then we -- I 
saw Tom Mix several times. 

Q: Tom Mix -- 

A: You wouldn™t know, you are too young. 

Q: -- right. No, no, I do know Tom Mix. I do know. 

A: Tom Mix was my big hero -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- right, and I loved that big bl
ack hat that he was wearing, ri
ght, all black and white. So he 
was the ultima te proof that the good in th
e United States shall always prevail -- 
Q: Always prevail, right. 

A: -- over the bad. And some how I said, oh gee, I 
wish they had a Tom Mi x right here, to teach 
that bastard a lesson, you see. 

Q: Right. 

A: And we saw -- we had American comi cs, whic
h were eventually prohibited. And amongst the 
comi cs I liked Flash Gordon and 
Mandrake the Magician, you see. 
So there was that American 
freedom of s pirit -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
48 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- beckoning, but not forceful enough for us to ha
ve wanted to say from our class, I have to 
drop everything and we™ll go to America -- 

Q: [indecipherable] right. 

A: -- be part -- part and 
parcel of that spirit. 
Q: Did you see the 1936 Olympics on film on the news? 

A: I saw the Olympics on film, oh ye ah, 
oh boy, it wa -- was so [indecipherable] 
Q: What did -- 

A: On fil m, yes, because there was no televi sion -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- you see, and I -- I was [indecipherable] 
the three Hungarian [indecipherable] why don™t I 
reme mber the German [i ndecipherable]?  We  had nothing to do with the Ge rmans.  

Q: But let me  ask you some thing, when you wa
tch this -- the -- 
the 1936 Olympics -- 
A: The film?  I was ve
ry impressionable. 
Q: What did you think of that? 

A: I was -- I was overwhelmed by the notion that 
systems in the world, the American system -- I 
glorified Owens. All my fr iends loved Jesse Owens, and they all cr iticized Hitler for not 

personally pinning a special me dal on Jesse Ow -- 

Q: Right, and what did you think? 

A: -- because he -- they -- it 
was not a ma tter of righteousness
, it was a matter of, there is 
some thing in America which should allow even 
a black man -- and the rumor had it that the 
blacks didn™t have it easy in America in the 1920™s - ‚30™s. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
49 
 
A: You should allow some  specific black me n to 
have the specialized training to ma ke use of 
their natural talents. And that 
was kind of almost like a rena
issance type of belief, you know. 
Q: And did you ha -- 

A: If you have the talent, you™re
 worthwhile being developed. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: All systems would have that. The East Germans ma de use  of that premise too, but -- so we 

loved Jesse Owens. We  had no feeli
ng for the German athletes, butwe necessarily rooted for the 
Hungarian. And would you believe  
it?  A nation of 10 million had -- were third best amongst the 
gold me dal winners? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They were our national heroes. 

Q: So what did -- what did you think of the fact
 that Hitler didn™t pin the me dal on Jesse Owens? 
A: Oh, he didn™t [indecipherable]. H
itler was to me  an alien figure. 
Q: He was an alien figure. 

A: You know, I reme mb er my dad was rooting lik
e crazy, yelling like -- my dad was a very 
[indecipherable] civil gentlema n, he -- he got 
carried away when the Hungarians were winning 
the gold me dals. He said absolutely nothing when
 the Germans were winning their medals, and I 
think the Germans came fi rst best  ther e. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: First best, they had the largest nu
mber of me dals, but [indecipherable] 
Q: And wha t  were you hearing about Hitler 
from your father and from other people? 
A: Oh, th-the fi -- the film -- I think I saw the fi
lm a year later and for what I™ve seen through it, 
and it ma y influence my  reasoning, it was one of 
the most creative films e ver as a docume ntary, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
50 
 
bringing you all kinds of new nuances of 
moviemaking, including attempts at early 
[indecipherable] things like that. 
And the glor ification scenes of 
the flags and all that. There™s a 
lot of glorification of fl ags in the United States
 today, so ma ybe the Ame r icans learned from her, 
right, how to do all those things. 
Q: You™re talking a
bout Leni Riefen -- 

A: But the -- the politics of 
it -- the politics of it remain 
hidden in the background, you know 
why?  Because Berlin was selected unanimously
 to become the site of the 1936 Olympics. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And all the democratic nations, having underw
ritten that, my fa mily had no reason to 
question. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It was 1936. Hitler had already shown his 
muscle. The Zargebeit have got back, the 
[indecipherable] have gotten bac
k. He -- the Austrian [indecipherable] is already working on, 
right? And there were all kinds of
 Nazi things, plots 
all over the world, right
, even United States 
[indecipherable] starting to show its ugly head, 
ri ght? So we had all the major --  there were 
[indecipherable] countries appr
oving of that. You would say, we
ll, things are normal. Hitler 
seems to be accepted, it™s a sporting event -- 

Q: So that -- 

A: -- ma ybe just like the one now in China, right? 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: And if it™s a sporting event, whatever exce
sses there may have been against the Jewish 
population, right, the Kristallnacht in 1934, that w
ould have been a singular bad experience in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
51 
 
history, but it will never reoccur. The opinion wasthe world was at peace with Hitler because he 
hadn™t yet -- 

Q: Kris-Krist allnacht -- 

A: -- pulled the rug under any of
 the other [indecipherable] 
Q: -- ri ght, Kristallnacht  
doesn™t occur until ™38. 
A: It™s in 1938, I was 11 years old. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: You see, and th-the movie, I reme mber the mo
vie, it really glorifie
d, I thought as a kid, the 
exceptional huma n contents of exceptionally gift
ed athletes, and kind of an ideal to which you 
would aspire. 

Q: You™re talking about Leni Rie -- 

A: It never dawned upon me , the Aryan thing, never dawned upon me . 

Q: You™re talking about Leni Riefenstahl™s -- 
A: That™s right -- 
Q: -- film about the Olympics. 

A: That™s right, that™s right. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now, if we had been told th
en, warned then, that is actually 
a Riefenstahl type of propaganda 
on behalf of Nazis -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- I™d have had, ma ybe, as a fairly crea
tive thinking 11 year old, a second thought. I never 
discovered behind that -- beyond 
-- behind that, the intent. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
52 
 
A: Now, wa s it an attempt to -- by Hitler, th
rough Riefenstahl to bl
ind everybody?  Was she an 
instrume nt of Nazi political power ma nipulatio
n? Well, she was then 
about -- about 25 -- 28 
years old, or some thing like that. She could have 
fallen under the spell of 
Hitler and done exactly 
what Hitler wanted her to do 
without anybody else  catching on. Now how do I rem -- how do I 
look at the Olympics these days?   
Q: No, I really want to know wh
at -- what it was like for you then? 

A: What I would have done?  If I had been -- 

Q: Beca -- beca -- no, I mean who -- who -- when you were 11 years old. You were thinking 

about sports -- 

A: No, but oh, if -- if 
-- if I had been -- 
Q: -- so it™s not 
a political issue. 
A: -- oh I™d -- I would have l
oved to have been 17 - 18. 
Q: T -- so that you could have gone. 
A: As good as I was and I would have 
loved to be part of the scene. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Now, would I have loved th
at because I had dark hair a
nd brown eyes, and winning the -- 
winning the [indecipherable] champi onship in wo
rld Ping Pong, not because I was dark haired, 
but because  I would have  been best  at it.  

Q: Right. 

A: And that™s exactly the point. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Wa nting to be best at some thing has nothing 
to do with race or creed. You have the talent, 
develop it, but it doesn™t ma ke
 you be tter than anybody else. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
53 
 
Q: When the Germans -- 
A: Oh, I™d have loved to have been part 
of that movie, why not, glorifying sport. 
Q: Of that movie. 

A: You were in -- you™re in
 -- you™re -- as long as you™re
 engaged in sport, right? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You cannot -- you™re not supposed
 to -- not engage in sex at 
the same time, right?  Nor are you 
engaged in racism. 

Q: Mm-hm. But clearly there was a racist  element in that. 

A: Oh, but surely it was, on hindsight. 

Q: Yeah, right. But -- but that
™s not what you noticed then. 
A: No, no, I didn™t notice that, I was just carried 
away with the Hungarian
s having an incredible 
performa nce.  

Q: But you saw some thing about Jesse Owens, you a
nd your friends. You saw th
at -- that Hitler 
would not put on -- give him the me dal,
 cause he was so angry that -- 
A: We ll, at the -- the -- please don™t forget, at
 the level of 11 year 
olds, the German yo- youth 
were already in the Hitler youth. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We  were boy scouts. 

Q: Right. 

A: In Hungary there were boy scouts, there we
re no Hitler youth. Actually, in Hungary there 
never were any Hitler youth. In the Banar there 
we re Volksdeutsche Hitler youths equi valent , but 
that™s a very -- way secondary, lower com -- con-consideration. So if you™re a boy scout, you™re 

a Universalist, you kind of look at
 the Hitler youth we knew, but there were no movies about the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
54 
 
Hitler youth. You™ll notice all pl aca
rds, you received placards [indecipherable] say, well they are 
doing the same , they said they all look so bl
onde. Why do they all look so blonde?  But they 
didn™t go beyond that. We were Hu
ngarians on the -- of all kinds
 of mi xed. You have light 
blondes, dark blondes, you have Slavic looking t
ypes, you have Gypsy looking types, all kinds of 
[indecipherable] 

Q: So in ™38 when the -- when H
itler -- when there™s the anschluss -- 
A: Took Austria. 

Q: -- in Austria. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Wh- Wha t do you think? 

A: It had no import on us -- 

Q: No i mport. 

A: -- except my -- my gr andmother was sayi
ng oh, now business will 
become  a bit better. 
Q: Will beco me better? 

A: Yeah. Well, when Hitler invaded Austria,
 I [indecipherable] in the world invaded 
consciously, not liberated oka
y, it™s a big difference. 
Q: Ri-Right. 

A: An Ger man -- Austrian German would say 
liberated. [indecipherabl
e] invaded Austria, 
occupied Austria -- 

Q: But there was no war. 

A: -- our business was improving, because -- 

Q: But there was no war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
55 
 
A: There was no war, right, but there was massive unemployment. And Austria had needed 
access to the German ma rket -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- who were fully employed under the auspices 
of the state. Exports, subsidies, you name  it, 
Hitler had that. Chalke ha d worked on the polic
ies ma gnificently. All of a sudden Germans are 
getting money and gold from all over the pl ace, but 
they weren't satisfied, right? And part of that 
over-spilled into Austria, part 
of that  into the agricultural ec
onomies, because the agriculture 
economy ne eded machinery. In exchange for th
e machinery, they delivered to the Germans 
[indecipherable] for butter and whipping cream.
 I reme mber after the Germans came i nto 
Vienna, six weeks after there was no whipping 
cream left in Vienna, which was a ma jor 
catastrophe, don™t laugh at me . The Germans to
ok it all. But they paid for in cash. 
Q: So what happens to 
the Jews in Austria -- 

A: So business improved. 
Q: Do you know th -- do you know about that? 
A: The what? 

Q: What -- what happened -- do you -- do you hear
, as a ki -- you™re what, 14 years old? 
A: No, that was 1938?  
I was 13 years old. 
Q: 13 years. 

A: Al most 14, yeah. 

Q: 14. Do you hear about what happens to the Jews when it -- when the Germans -- 

A: Oh no, there was -- well, in Austria -- I was 
not in Vienna itself in 1938, but there was a 
disquiet. Mr. Frank expressed -- sometimes he ca
me  with very sad face to his -- to card game s 
with my dad. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
56 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And it lasted for about two years, and then 
it suddenly just gone, I™ve 
t -- I™ve told you that. 
Q: Right, he was disappearing. 

A: But we heard from fri e nd in Vienna that the 
Jewish people had disappear
ed in the course of 
June, July 1938, literally overn
ight. And all those ghastly sc
enes about the broomsticks, you 
know, having to clean the streets -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you know, wash the roads [indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: -- underneath, that those excesses had happened, 
but the observation there is that sa -- I 
reme mber some  of the Austria monarchists saying qu
ite cr itically, if the al
lies hadn™t destroyed 
Austria-Hungary, the Jewish pogrom
s would never have happened. 
Q: We ll, how about -- 
A: -- because the Jewish populati
on was at peace during the r-rei
gn of Joseph -- Franz Joseph the 
second, was at peace with 
the community at large. 
Q: But ha -- that™s -- 
A: -- and were fully [indecipherable] 

Q: -- how was that an -- 

A: -- that, but only at the level of the higher bou
rgeoisie. So they were in Hungary, even though 
less so, because the Hungarian aristocracy was ve
ry opposed to the Jewish rising influence in 
financial services especially, right. But with 
the disintegration of th
e empi re, right, some body 
was made the scapegoat, and Hitler succeeded, I think -- I™m just jumping here -- succeeded in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
57 
 
convincing the only Austrian working class person 
without a job that Hitle
r™s proposition that the 
German Jews has benefited from the firs
t World War equally applied in Austria. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Na me ly that there was Austrian Jewish pers
on who had benefited from the first World Wa r. 
But that is absolute nonsense, because with 
Austria-Hungary being destroyed, everybody lost. 
But Hitler and the Nazis in Au
stria were able to exploit 
that. And as you would expect, 
ma nipulating those uneducated brains into ou-outbur -- outbursts of hatred, 
led to the scenes of 
the Austrian mob forcing -- with the policemen ju
st looking on, right, forci
ng the Jewish persons, 
including the highly intelligentsia Jewish person, including the very skilled doctor, and 

[indecipherable] to kneel on the streets 
and clean on the streets in Austria. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then there were no hue and cry. By th
e time there was no hue and cry when the Jews 

suddenly disappeared because anti-Semitism, latent amongst the peoples, masses at large, was 
brought on ve ry forcefully by Hitler™s own presence. 
Q: And is your father surprised at what happens? 

A: My father was lucky. My father was -- he wa
s, I think -- how should I 
answer that? Frank was 
a very good friend of his. I reme mbe r  there was 
a Jewish dentist [indeci pherable] Beshker, who 
was a very good friend of his. My father said pr
evious, as I mentioned to
 you, that Hitler would 
be -- would be a good means to ke
ep communism at bay and help 
us save our properties. But 
then with respect to the Jews, I think he was c
ontented to know -- too cont
ented to really believe 
that when the Jews of the Banar disappeared, 
that what the Ge rmans had claimi ng, including the 
Volksdeutsche German representative, that
 they were being rounded up for their own 
safekeeping, that™s where it stopped. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
58 
 
Q: And w-what if -- 
A: I think he fell into that  trap, if we -- 

Q: Did you -- did you fall into it as well, given th
at he said that to you, 
that you thought, well --  
A: Well, I -- I b -- I -- I believe -- 
I -- I still feel aggrieved about 
what happened to that  little 
Jewish girl that my brother was in love with. 
And I re -- I ca -- I sa
w my brothercrying ma ny, 
many, many times, and I never saw hi m smiling ev
er again. But I thought that was a singular 
case of a boy loving a girl, without referring 
to the girl being a Jewish girl. So -- 
Q: Mm-hm. And di -- so, di
d you talk with your broth -- 
A: So I was -- I was -- we ll, let™s see now, this 
would have been 1941, in June ™41 I was 16 years 
old. We  had -- I had no Jewish guys actually at all 
in the Hungarian school, but we couldn™t have 
had that because they had disappeared in the summe r of 1941. 

Q: Right. So did that -- 

A: No, let me just see -- 
Q: -- was that shocking to you, that these, all of
 these people just were 
-- disappeared?  Or not? 
A: Shocking?  We ll, absolu -- I™d have
 to go back in my me mory cells. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: What -- what about that distur
bed me  -- well, also kind of ma de 
me fe el neutral? I think I -- I 
must have kind of felt well, that™s
 the way things are these days. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: If they say -- and we knew that the superior fo
rce had come  in, if that is the way things are 
happening, that is part the way -- ay -- oh, you, I 
have the answer. I was much more concerned 
about the Germans, the Nazi Germa ns comi ng in and hanging hundreds of Serbs accused of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
59 
 
being communists, all over the ma in ma rket square
s in Montbachkirche, in Boch, in -- there are 
three major cities in the Banar. Montb
achkirche, Notchkinken and Ponchua, right? 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: They were hanging hundreds of Serbs, r
ounding up in the streets, without any cause 
whatsoever, and let them hang there for days, wi
th placards saying this is how people will end 

their lives if they raise their fi
sts, or whatever, do some thing ag
ainst the occupational force of the 
Germans. I was so perturbed about 
that, visibly in front of our eyes
, that the disappearance of the 
Jewish people was not really
 knowing where they™re gone to. 
Q: You didn™t see it, 
you couldn™t see it. 

A: There was no rumors about their [i ndecipherable]  

Q: Right. 

A: There was no knowledge of concentration camp. 

Q: There wasn™t? 
A: I think the much greater evil wa
s the hanging of a
ll these Serbs -- 
Q: I see. 
A: -- because they were
 left hanging there.  
Q: So there are no rumors about 
concentration camps in Ger many?  
A: There were nothing. 

Q: Nothing? 

A: Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Only noise 
-- [indecipherable] got to mean some thing very bad 

eventually, after the fact. Name
ly, the [indecipherable] kills. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
60 
 
A: They were rounded up, as I me ntioned to youalready in Montbachkirc
he, Libriken and in 
Ponchua. So some how they got over the [indecipher
able] linked with the idea of -- that ™s fr om 
where they were eventually di
sappeared, and nobody knows where. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: But there was no talk at al
l about concentration camps. Don™ t forget, the only concentration 
camp existing, the earliest one was Dachau 1936, 
and Dachau was not for Jewish people. The 
Jewish camps, I think, were be
ing opened up -- Flossenbürg 1939. 
Q: We ll, there are -- there are Jews who 
go, but those are not the first Jews -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- in ™33. 

A: That™s right. So actually the -- the -- the -- 
the -- the --  regretfully of cour -- in the -- the 
extermination camps -- 

Q: Were mu ch -- there 
later. Right, right. 
A: -- were only 1941 - ™42 - ™43. 

Q: But the -- the -- the general 
concentration camp system, whi c
h is huge in Germany by the 
time ™39 comes, and 1940 comes -- 

A: Yeah, but it was -- that was -- 

Q: Do you hear about that? 

A: It was -- it -- it goes back to 
t hat  but  t h -t he -- the -- f-from wh
at I™ve read since then including 
Charter™ s book on Hitler and all that, the -- the main
 intention of the early concentration camps is 
to make it a point to which to -- into -- which 
to enclose completely, the enemies of the stat e 
political. Communists, reactionaries, anti-Nazi
s, generally speaking. And eventually the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
61 
 
unterklass, name ly the Gypsies, in that order, an
d only eventually the Jewi
sh people, in camps of 
their own. 
Q: But what do you hear w -- that™s wh
at you read later, but what do you -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- hear when you™re growing 
up, about those camps, anything? 
A: No, I -- 

Q: You don™t hear anything. 

A: -- knew nothing about it at all. 

Q: Nothing. 

A: No differ e nce. Absolutely nothing. Actually, 
I was -- I was drafted in 17 -- in -- in June -- 
June 1
st
, 1942. I was in the Balkans, in the Prinz 
Eugen division all this time, until September 
1944. In September 194 -- the Soviets broke thro
ugh Roma nia into Serbia and their -- our 
division was ma ssacred, being put 
up against the [indeci
pherable] 90 percent of the personnel we 
lost fighting the Soviets. In that
 time being in Yugoslavia, I knew
 nothing, I™d seen nothing about 
concentration camps. The first concentration camp I 
did see is on my way to
 the officers™ school. 
We were supposed to be -- this was early in
 January 1945 -- supposed to be in Nuremb urg. 
Nuremburg was bombed the hell out of on the 11
th
 and 12
th
 of January, so we were rerouted 
towards the end of January to Leitme ritz. A
nd on the way to Le itmeritz in the Czech repu -- 
northwestern Czech Republic, we are -- there was onl
y one road leading to Leitmeritz, and on the 
right hand side the road was Theresienstadt. And re
me mber sitting in the lo
rries, about 10 - 20 of 
us in the lorry, and we were told at a certain 
mo ment on the road, now you must look to the left, 
you™re not allowed to look to the right. And army
 being the army, we looke
d to the left, but some  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
62 
 
of them, why don™t we look to the 
left?  Because there are Jewish pe
ople there, not supposed to -- 
you are not allowed to look at them. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I reme mb er that , that  
was end of January, around 20
th
 of January, 1945. 
Q: ™45, mm- h m.  

A: And that™s when this notion of Jewish 
people, huh, concentration camp came up in the mi nd. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Right?  And then we talked to each other and so
me  of them who had been
 in the Soviet Union 
on the eastern front for several years had come  
across concentration camp in eastern Europe, in 
Poland, right?  And that day they interconnected 
as ah-ha, this must be a concentration camp. 
Only eventually di d we learn that it was Theresienstadt . 

Q: Right. 

A: But Theresienstadt wa s a, quote unquote, mo
del concentration camp, to which the Red Cross 
dignitaries were invited, showi
ng them off, even Jewish plays,
 Jewish theater, Jewish opera, 
Jewish musicians and things like that. Nobody ta
lked of the [indecipherable] of the small 
fortress, which was the extermination part of Theresienstadt. 

Q: And wha t  about going to Auschwitz? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: Many people from Theresienstadt were
 sent to Auschwitz and gassed, right? 
A: Oh -- oh yeah. Yeah. 

Q: So what happens to you in 1939 when you find out now -- now you are 14 -- 

A: Yeah, I™m 14. 

Q: No -- 14. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
63 
 
A: Yeah, 14. 1939, 14. 
Q: You™re 14. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And the Germans attack Poland and begin setting up ghettos. Do you know anything -- 

A: We ll, first of all, your -- ma ybe we shouldn™
t leave Austria. Don™t forget, my dad was an 
Austrian Royalist Monarchist who was looking down at Hitler. 

Q: Right. But -- 

A: But with the absorption of Austria -- 

Q: -- but he would say that -- 

A: Wait, wait. 

Q: All right. 

A: With the absorption of Austria into Germany - -  

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- an impossible combination happened in th
e mi nd of one, who was an Austrian Royalist, 
name ly, throughout 800 years of history, Austri
a had never been subjugated to Germany. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And a real Austro-Hungarian would never wa nt 
any part of Ger many, because that™s the way 
history was. Either you™re a German -- an Austrian
 Imperialist, or a German Imperialist, and you 
will never forget that Bismarck, upon being aske
d personally by the Kaiser representative in 
1898 if he would concern that Austro-Hungary 
join Germany, the new Reich in an economi c 

union, said Austro-Hungary will never qualify fo
r a deve -- for an economi c union because they 
are an underdeveloped, backward country. A real
 Austro-Hungarian w
ould never forgive the 
Germans for that. And my father never did. At th
e same time he said, well, Hitler is Austrian. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
64 
 
Why don™t you look at it from the point of view 
of Austria bringing Germany into the fold?  
Ridiculous. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: How can a little country absorb a huge count
ry and not grow ill over that, right? So in a 
certain sense my father™s att
itude as a Royalist, in my ey
es, was compromi sed. I didn™t know 
how to explain it then, but I s
ee it today. But at the base of th
at was my father™s hatred of 
Bolshevism, because don™t forget, in the -- in 
the si -- the trigger for my dad actually was 

reawakening him to the threat of Bolshevism in the -- the civil war in Spain. There is official 

knowledge that they burned about 300 church
es, the communists, three ma jor cathedrals, 
violated at least 10,000 nuns a
nd killed 5,000 priests and bishops. Now, we had no use for 
Catholicism,  but as a Christian you would say, if 
communists can do that in that country, they™re 
a threat for all of European 
civilization, because Spain was 
part and pa rcel of western 
civilization, for the better, worse, 
the everything, in spite of the ho
rrible things they did in South 
America. 

Q: We ™re going to have -- 

A: What? 

Q: Yes, I™m sorry, we™re going to stop. 

A: Very, very important. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
65 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
A: You know, you mi ght be aski ng this question,
 how about the economics of Hitler?  How ma ny 
people got to support Hitler amongst the previous 
so-called hi gh bourgeois circles? Because he 
was jobs, he was economics, he wa s foreign curr
ency and he was international power. Most of 
them did. 
Q: Y-You rolling?  Okay. 

A: So what place di d greed play? 

Q: I don™t know, does -- does -- did 
it play a lot?  Did you see it?   
A: Well, I just tell you that, sure. Fr om the H
itlerian policies of full e mployme nt, everybody who 
had suffered from [indecipherable] unemployme nt would benefit. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So the job creation prevailed over -- from th
e me ntal principles of morality. Never look 
beyond the day after tomorrow. Everybody was cashing 
in, especially on foreign exchange. Even 
the Jewish pe ople -- 

Q: But now -- now -- 

A: -- early in the Hitler regime  we
re cashing in on foreign exchange. 
Q: Right. 

A: And Hitler forbade them to exchange in foreign exchange dealings, right? Cause he wanted 

the so-called pure Germans to have full cont
rol over foreign exchange [indecipherable] 
supporting the national interest because the Jewish people would then take the foreign exchange 

and then deposit it abroad, right? So the first di
stinction, actually racial
 discrimi nation, actually 
[indecipherable] openly professed 
that against the Jews, was [i
ndecipherable] recognition, that 
the money, foreign exchange, has to be kept at
 home , and those who sabotage that had to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
66 
 
imprisoned or even hanged. So Kristallnacht wa
s just a small example of what was really 
happening in the background, and that has never b
een researched. And eventually the Jewish 
people fell into step, you see?  They had to give
 up their own disposition of foreign exchanges, 
they had to report like everybody else, but they had lo
st the trust, because some had been able to 
ma nage to deposit substantial dollar accounts, righ
t?  So the Ge rman Ger mans got ma d, right, and 
went after them because they were Jews, not because they were capitalist fi nanciers. So the greed 

-- and everyone was on the bandwagon. Land prices were going up, so you bought land prices 

cheap, reselling them at higher values. There were certain guarantees by the Hitler regime. If 

your direct recourse as a high 
ranking party me mb er you could 
that -- get all the financial 
funding you wanted to get to -- to -- to do this [i
ndecipherable] right?  It pa
id there for bec -- to 
become  a party me mber and move up high in the rank because you were a talent ed foreign 

exchange admi nistrator. You got 
these medals of this and that 
and everything else. And with the 
greed, there was the greed for Jewish accumulati
ons of currency, Jewish accumulations of -- of 
the fine arts especially, and 
the disappearance, in a very s
hort period of time , period around -- 
when was that, 1930 -- 1940 - 1941, of all those very
 famous  [indecipherable] in Berlin, Jewish 
art dealers, right, with the Germans s e questeri
ng all that, even though th
ey let go guys like -- like 
Rosen-Rosenbaum -- Rosenthal, right?  So with
 that greed, the greed 
became massive, plunder, 
all the [indecipherable] Jewish pr
operties to start, then the pr
operties of the Polish aristocracy, 
and then looking beyond that, the plundering of
 westernmost Russia. Great cause for invasion, 
the invasion wasn™t abou
t eradicating communism. The invasion was the Germans, t he -- Hitler 
needed all the raw ma terials he could lay his 
hands on, and whatever wo
rld there was, including 
the -- incl uding the wealth creation in the -- in 
the Ukraine under -- under top level agricultural 

soil. Plunder was at the base of
 it. Typical me dieval warfare. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
67 
 
Q: So, in 19 -- 
A: And everybody jump ed in the bandwagon. My 
grandmother ma de a profit [indecipherable] 
the extra jobs and the extra contract s, right? 
So the question of morality? Hitler didn™t say he 
wanted all that because he was going to ma jor -- wage a ma j or war. Oh, by the way, have you 

noticed something interesting?  That  great courag
eous, purely racist superior German nation was 
only winning wars against little countries that were
 little and totally unarmed. So where is the big 
heroism?  Killing all the you -- the Poles in six w
eeks?  The ger -- the Yugoslavs in four weeks?  

Hungarians, just walked over, Roma nia walked 
over. Big deal. The Frenchies were unprepared, 
right? And they were comparatively a much s mal
ler country, right, smaller industrial capacity 
and that. So what about -- ma ny of the German
s today still claim -- oh my God, I know from the 

trial, most of the Germa ns have -- Vi el tria
l, most of the German opinion hasn™t changed. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We  are a heroic nation, look at 
us tha -- to some  of 
the m, it™s the -- some 
of the veteran -- we 
were fighting the whole world. No other nation c
ould have been able to do it. How stupid. But 
nobody knew that in 1938. 

Q: So if -- in -- between -- 

A: You know the domino effect?  Hitler was thefirst practitioner of 
the domi no effect -- 
Q: Domi no effect. 

A: -- the countries that had no problem [indeciphe
rable] sorry, I ma y have gone off the tangent. 
Q: Between 1939 and 1941, so ™39 the German
s attack, the Nazi
s attack Poland. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And then in ™41 they attack the S
oviet Union. What™s happening to -- 
A: Well, the -- fi rst of all 
Austria, Austria my f -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
68 
 
Q: We ll, that™s ™38. 
A: -- my da d -- my dad learned how to live with th
at. He was a realist, but he sa -- quietly he 

remained an Austrian Imperial  
[indecipherable] of the Kaiser. 
Q: But I™m asking about you, because -- 

A: And that was that. 

Q: -- but -- but you -- 

A: And openly -- openly, like ma ny others he said, 
we need Hitler because we can use him. Okay 
-- 

Q: But what happens to you -- 

A: This applies 1940 just as much. 

Q: -- but what happens to you between 1939 and 1941, before -- 

A: Sa me  opinion, the same  opinion -- 

Q: The same  opinion as your father. 
A: -- got even more prevalent because Hitler ha
d brought law and order, he  had kicked out the 
communists, or imprisoned the communists, or 
exterminated the communists except for the few 
who were getting away to the Soviet Union. A
nd the bourge -- bourgeoisie, I think if I can 
generalize like that, from my own family™s point 
of view, they were sayi
ng well, at least he has 
given us jobs, he has given us law and order and 
he has given us the perception that the commies 
have dimi nished their influence in central Europe
, and that the possibility
 of a Spanish civil war 
reoccurring, destroying the aristocracy and the -- 
the bourgeoisie -- our bo
urgeoisie in central 
Europe has been -- has been 
put to -- brought to a halt. 
Q: And did you want Germany to come  into Hungary? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
69 
 
A: I was never a German watcher, my -- my dream was always to go to Budapest and play the 
first fiddle somewhere along the lin
e in Hungarian foreign policy, which would have been a very 
difficult thing to do because the Hungarians ha
te the Roma nians. The Hungarians hate the 
thought -- my God, the Hungarians hate the G
ypsies, and ma ny Hungarians hated the Jewish 
people. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So being a Hungarian diplomat, it ma y -- ma
y not have been a wise choice at all, on 
hindsight. 

Q: Right. 

A: But that thought is what -- 

Q: But that™s what you were thinking about. 

A: -- was my ability to get away from the peasan
t way of life and don™t forget I had two uncles in 
Budapest and they had very important governme
nt posts, so I™d be 
like in good hands in 
Budapest. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my father always said [speaks forei
gn language here] You have got to become  a 
some body, you™ve got to become  a some body bec a
use you are number one, right, after the war 
and I said -- well I™ve already me
ntioned that to you, see. And 
before the war, to become  a 
number one [indecipherable] you had to go to Buda
pest, which was the capital city closest to 
[indecipherable]. And then it was hort --
 Horthy was, for me , until 1944, when the 
[indecipherable] replaced him, a 
person that I could trust because 
he had [indecipherable] of Béla 
Kun, he had provided Hungary with enough economi c 
benefits for association with the Germans 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
70 
 
and the re-association with the Austrians. And he
 al so kept  t h e ri ffraff, Ro mani an ri ffr aff and 
things like that kind of at bay. 
So I could live with the system. 
Q: Mm-hm. But when -- when the Germans a
ttack Russia in 1941, be
fore you get into the 
Waffen SS - -  
A: Before that Yugoslavia come s 
in, don™t forget please, April 1941. 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: That changed everything. The real -- that -- 
the German a ttack on northern Yugoslavia and 
the ma rching through Roma nia demonstrated to 
me that the German power was overwhelming 
and it couldn™t care less about 
the individualism and th
e natural character of
 the smaller nation. 
They would just ma rch in, right, occupy them and brutalize them. And w
ith the first hanging of 
these dozens and dozens of Serbs, and letting th
em be hanging there on the ma rket for days and 
days and days, demonstrate to me  that there wa
s some thing about the Germans that you had to be 
frightened of. 
Q: So you become  frightened? 
A: But the only way -- I became in that 
sense anti-Nazi -- anti-German German. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But that was no diffe rent because most Aust
rians throughout the history were anti-German, 
right? But -- 

Q: But that wasn™t true now. 

A: -- the feeling that f -- the fee
ling strengthened to me . So I wa
s looking at Budapest even more, 
saying that the Serbs had been defeated, they have
 become  i mpotent, where 
else can I go? I™d -- I 
was just about to finish my high school educa
tion so I was hanging onto the dream of going to 

Budapest and shedding this Barcika and Barnar
d be -- and being in the core country of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
71 
 
ma rginalization. I would have been ha ppy with 
that. My education was getting to it, and the 
influence of Anna Fayish, was a lady the sec
ond [indecipherable] that 
raised me , right,was 
strictly a -- Baylor, you go to 
Budapest, you™ll be okay. And I thought going to Budapest I™d be 
able to kind of hide from a
ll these things. And the first th
ing you know they drafted me . 
Q: Well, let me ask you something. How -- 
how do you accommodate for both thinking that 
when the Nazis come  in -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- they do things to individuals -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- that your -- you™re no longer 
safe as an individual any more. 
A: Not any more. 

Q: And -- and the world in which you want to live by then -- 

A: You see, but don™t -- don™t forget
, at that time being an indi vidual still meant something in -- 
in -- in -- in soci -- societal 
layers in which you could claim to 
have some  residual rights, if you 
were V.I.P., cooperating with the Germans. You 
were guaranteed as long 
as you cooperated. If 
you were some body highly critical of the Germa ns, 
or [indecipherable] to the Serbs, they pick 
you up and shoot you. So -- and there was no in betwee
n. You were either there or here. To be in 
the mi ddle and have no opinion at all would be pe
rhaps true of the peasants who were working. 

If you were in the bourgeoisie, one way or the othe
r you were visible, right?
 You were out in the 
open and you necessarily were expected to wield an
 opinion. Now, the opinion coul dn™t be like -- 
I have -- I have not seen i-in the Barnard 
where I was living then, 
any Hungarian leader 
ma rching in the street and tel
ling the Germans it is wrong for you 
to hang all the Serbs. They 
were keeping their mout h shut. I have never seen 
a Protestant or a Catholic preacher, priest  or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
72 
 
bishop, and there were several bishops in a 
large area, going out and telling German 
[indecipherable] German, you mustn™
t do that, it™s inhuman. So they were hold their mouth shut 
as far as possible if they had no depe
ndents and linkages with the Germans. 
Q: So -- 

A: But the ones in industry, the ones who were 
delivering wheat, the ones who were delivering 
the wines to the Germans, they necessaril
y were okay under economi c advantage. And you 
know, in circumstances like that, unless you have 
economic survival, you have no survival. Now, 
this is a horrendous statement to ma ke. If th
e economi c survival depends on your -- is the 
outcome  of your unwillingness to pi
npoint the evil, and come  out and say it is wrong. Cause if 
you had done that, they shoot you. 

Q: So there was not -- 

A: So it was absolute power. I was faced for the 
first time  in my life with this. I di dn™t know the 
concept. I know now the concept of what is ab
solute power. I™m not saying that absolute power 
corrupts absolutely. It™s one of 
the aberrations. But, I was faced 
with absolute power, and seeling 
-- seeing all those dead ones, the di sappearance 
of the Jewish people, the quiet and furtive 
disappearance was a -- o- of lesser significance. 
Not because  they were Jewish people, but 
because it wa s invisible, if right
 in front of your nose, what 
horrendous thing the Germans could 
do. At the same  ti me  they were all marchi
ng. I reme mber the black uniforms in -- in 
Montbachkirche, the t -- ma in town hall was a gr
eat old traditional build
ing, Austrian style. 
Beautiful all kind of statues and beautiful columns a
nd that -- and they we re -- the ma in gate was 
about 10 feet wide and there was a German black 
uniform l e ft and right, beautiful blonde, and a -
- they were handing -- se lling [indecipherabl e] wh
ite -- white whatever y
ou call it, a piece of the 
leather st rips of that --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
73 
 
Q: [indecipherable] wait th -- 
one -- one second, one second. 
A: Absolute power. 
Q: What -- can you hold? 

A: Okay. Sorry. 

Q: Okay.  

A: They looked as an example of abs olute power
 in practice. You were 
terrified just looking at 
that. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then some  b -- would be partisan Serbs killed one of them. In return Germans r ounded up 

200 and hanged them on the following day. Just picking them up in the street of Montbachkirche. 

Hang them up on the main square. And then you™re
 a 17 year old kid, or a 16 year old kid, you 
say well, what is happening?  I know there was one 
mo ment in which my brother and I, with all 
this mi xing of things, we put on -- we  -- I was able
 to obtain a little Fren
ch flag, and I put the 
French flag on my lapel because I wasn™t a Germ
an, I wasn™t really a 
Hungarian in Hungary, I 
was a Hungarian living in the Barnard at that time
. I certainly wasn™t a Se
rb, I don™t want to look 
as a Roma ni an, which I possibly do. I wanted to
 say I™m special, I™m French. Trouble is, the 
French had already been defeated, 
so it didn™t rea
lly mean mu ch. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: But it was my brother™s and I kind of de mons
tration of something that
 we™re, hey, we™re a bit 
different, right?  We  are neither this, nor 
this, nor that. And cer
tainly not Ge rman.  
Q: And wha t  did your brother thi
nk of all this that was going on? 
A: Oh, he was so happy in the store, the -- b
ecause in terms of purchasing power, the -- I 
reme mber the [i ndecipherable] stor e had greate
r and greater diffi culties getting oranges, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
74 
 
getting all the select me rchandise because on
ce th-the Germans came in, all these so-called 
necessities for the bourgeoisie were disappearing, 
and ration cards were -- 
ensued, right?  So my 
brother™s concern was how do I help keep a store af
loat that  has become the meaning in my life? 
And how do I get oranges to my lady friend -- la
dy friend in the old traditional sense, right?  
Maybe touching, ma ybe  [indecipherable] but nothing 
more than that [indecipherable] the girl 
that I love, where oranges cannot be any more
 obtained because of the German e mba rgo on 
everything. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You see? So it was looking -- it was looking verymi serable, and I told you I had seen him cry 

quite a few time s after she disappeared -- 

Q: Would you -- would you have called yourself 
apolitical at that time, in a way? 
A: I was -- well, if apolitical by definition 
means you have no interest in politics, no.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I was surrounded too much by the first indications
 of absolute terror, not to take time out and 
think about the consequences. But having nowhe
re to turn, having nowhere to go, in that 
desperate situation I was looking mo re and more at 
Budapest as my safe haven, sort of imagining 
that Hitler would never do it to Horthy. And tw
o years later he did. And I reme mber that the 
Germans established a local police by the name  
of some  kind of a national guard populated or -- 
or peopled by Volksdeutsche and the chief of th
at was a -- a lawyer trained in Dubocka, in the 
adjacent province, a Dr. Wr ight, who had gotten 
his PhD [indecipherable] in German, in Nazi 
Germany be came -- came back down -- if you look 
at the typical Nazi, what do you see?  A huge 
chin, a small forehead, a big belly, strong legs, ey
es bulging forward like that, and cruelty in the 
face. He declared hi mself general of the police, right. He came to our home in March or  April 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
75 
 
1942 and said, Colonel, if you try -- I™ve gone on r
ecord with that, even in German court -- 
Colonel, if you try to hi de your brother -- 
your son -- your two sons, you will be declared 
ma garoni. Your sons, don™t try to get them over 
to Hungary, we™ll hide -- we™ll find them, we™ll 
put them up against the wall, we™ll shoot them. 
And ma de my father shut up. And our name  got 
onto the list. And I™m
 often -- I™ve often wondered, I still wo
nder, if I had been the father, being 
told that by a brutal looking Volksdeutsche nobo
dy whose son is a general of the police, what 
would I have done? 

Q: So what did he do? 

A: He did nothing. He lived thr
ough seeing our name s put on, then he
 talked to us, he said, you 
know, the time  has come to let you know that comm
unis m has become  a threat. Look at all these 
partisans killing all these Germans. You have an 
obligation going back to the empire, to keep the 
[indecipherable]. And that was that. 

Q: So that meant you had to join -- 
A: He gave up on us. 
Q: Uh-huh. So that, were you then conscripted? 

A: He gave up on us, yeah. I [indecipherable] 
very often, and I™ve often wondered -- and my 
brother said, absolutely I will not go, and my 
father said look, if you don™t want the whole 
catastrophe of the whole fa mily, because Wr ight
 was a -- oh Wr ight was, by the way, c-caught 
by the partisans early in 1945.  

Q: Who was  -- 

A: Irwin Wr ight, Dr. Wr ight. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
76 
 
A: The con -- so-called -- self declaimed gene
ral [indecipherable] police [indecipherable] were 
caught and unceremoniously hanged for repeated 
brutality and -- and crimes against hu mankind. 
He personally was involved in ma ny tortures of 
presumed partisan leaders. I reme mber those 
stories kind of, kind of. He deserved what he was getting, but itwas Wr ight who really caused 
[indecipherable] my brot
her™s eventual dying. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You see. And -- but again, I -- I™m -- I -- I™m 
-- I™m against people ca -- 
getting some  cri minal 
types and hanging them on the tree, but I think the 
partisans were absolutely right to hang him.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I™ll go on official record, I told the German ju
dges that. See, he was -- he was -- he was -- he 
was -- he was a criminal, not just -- 

Q: So why did -- why did this guy -- oh, there 
he is. Okay. [tape break] I™ll check it out. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay. All right, we™reready. You [indecipherable] 
A: So, just to let you know that even though I™ve 
always suffered with this -- this notion that 
since I don™t have a PhD in philo
sophy, I™ll never be
 fi rst  cl ass. 
Q: Right. 

A: But at least I™m linked to some body who is. 

Q: Yes, right. 

A: Okay, we go -- 

Q: Tell me , why did this guy Wr ight go to your father
 to say that he better
 -- that you two -- that 
you two boys would be put on the list. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
77 
 
A: Because my father was a visi ble me mber
 of the community, equally at home in the 
Hungarians speaking and the German speaking, ha
ving a mo ther who was Austrian Ge rman and 
therefore, by the Hitlerian laws had given offspr
ing to a half German, wh
o had given offspring to 
quarter Germans, because Austria ha d been absorbed into Germany, had become  Ger manized, 
and in terms  of the racial prof
ile you had to go back seven genera
tions to prove that you were 
Aryan, right? 

Q: Right. 

A: We  were qualified, classified as half Germans . 

Q: But it sounds fe -- 

A: Wait, wait, wait -- 

Q: Yes, okay. 

A: -- as half Germans. And since they needed
 everybody to get the 27,000 Volksdeutsche recruit 
-- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- to fill in the numbe rs of our division, they
 had to reach out for persons well beyond the pure 
Germanis m of the really simple Volksdeutsche,
 who were a hundred percent Germanic, right?  
And since my father was a visible me mber of th
e community, going to him, to gave an example -
- he [indecipherable] Wr ight was g 
-- was given example to others -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- who were like of mixed blood, to ma ke
 sure. And depending on how my father would 
behave, they would then
 also fall into step. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
78 
 
A: So my fa ther, as I already me ntioned to 
you, proved that [indecipherable] morally, he said 
you™re obliged to, because Austria-Hungary was al
ways there to defend we
stern civilization from 
the [indecipherable] from Asia, right, so the wa r ca -- secondly the church approves of tha-that, 
the church dema nds that, God de ma nds that, and 
thirdly I™ll tell you, ther
e is no choice, period. 

And there was no way out. There was nowhere to go. 

Q: Right. So do you receive a notice to come? 

A: Ah yes, yes, it was a notice, yeah. After Wr
ight came I think the notice came  about a week 

after, saying that the notice was a formal noti
ce of induction and the notice of you shall present 
yourself -- my brother was, I think, on the fi
rst of May and I was on the first of June. 
Q: And were you in the same  divi
sion?  The Prince Eugen division? 
A: Sorry? 

Q: We re you in the same division? 

A: Yeah, in the same  division, yeah. It was stri
ctly that the whole Barnard was used for the 
setting up of the Prince Eugen division, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the Prince Eugen has very special signif
icance in Austria™s hi story, because it was he 
who beat the chur -- the Turks, and expanded th
e Austrian bi -- b-boundaries to include the -- 
that whole area into
 Austria-Hungary. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right -- right around the Da
nube river, beyond where the Ro ma nian boundary is today.  
Q: So your -- your brother a
nd yourself both get letters -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- at the same ti me. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
79 
 
A: Everybody, everybody -- 
Q: Everybody gets letters. 

A: -- everybody -- I thin
k actually letters were sent out 
to those who had better schooling, 
because we, the gradua tes of -- even though I wasin Hungarian school -- so it had no business in 

using me  at all, because it was 
the induction of the Volksdeutsche. The Volksdeutsche were all 
linked with the Volksdeutsche shul -- schools th
at were established after the Germans came in, 
and they were established with the Ge rmans in us
ing the -- the Nazi orient
ed leadership of the 
Volksdeutsche then, to set up German schools fo
llowing the right German examples. And those 
who were in that school when [indecipherable] 
German speaking. I was in Hungarian school and 
they drafted me  even though I was -- and my
 brother had already finished high school. 
Q: But you were considered Vo
lksdeutsche in some  way. 

A: Yeah, ah -- th-they we re -- in
 their declaration they
 had to refer to me  as Volksdeutsche as 
they would have had no right
 whatsoever to dr aft me . 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So I am a n honorary Volksdeutsche, d
eclared so by the Hitler regime . Big deal. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Spoke some  Ger man, but the German was not
 -- I can show you all my photos, all my photos 
the back wall -- on th-the back pa
ge they have Hungarian language. 
Q: But did you spea -- 

A: I knew German, but I was by now means -- I was very far from being -- and I didn't 

understand German German. They a r e co
mpletely different [indecipherable] 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That™s why I was demoted [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
80 
 
Q: And whe r e were -- where were y
ou and your brother 
sent at first? 
A: My brother went first. He was already in the 
-- he was -- he was forced to go to the artillery 
regiment. I re -- I reme mber him, reme mbering vi
siting when he was in [indecipherable], he was 
about 80 kilome ters above where I was and I reme
mber seeing the -- the barracks where he was. 
He was inside the barracks, holding on desperat
ely to the steel parti
tions, looking like the guy, 
I™ve got to get away, I™ve got to get away. And I 
was cry. And I went with my father, my father 
said nothi ng, just stony face, but I saw in my brot
her™s eyes that he was so terribly unhappy. He 
ran away three times, and he took phone calls fr
om my dad e very time  and the third time they 
almost shot him, but then, upon repeated phone ca
lls, they decided they would demote him from 
the signals into a punishme nt
 battalion. And he stayed w
ith that until he died.  
Q: And wha t  is -- what 
is a punishment battalion? 
A: Punish battalion is a batta
lion which was set up specificall
y for those who don™t -- don™t 
perform military duty according to regulations. Those who have been captured tryi ng to escape, 
or known to have been wa nting to escape, or 
those who have been es
caped and then captured. 
And it™s -- the survival rate was then ma ybe 10 
percent. And I reme mber my brother™s face, I 
reme mber my brother™s face, I think he came ther
e when I was visiting also in the -- that was a 
kind of second -- around the 25
th
 of December 1944, when I was being brought up with a couple 
of other officer candidates from thes e front lin
es in the Balkans through a little village on the 
Danube river, where he was stationed with hi
s battalion. And I had found out where he was and 
we saw ourselves ma ybe for a half an hour and 
we talked about what can we do, where can we 
go. And he told me  look, you™ll be  behind the front, you better go because it™ll save your life. 
And he said, as far as I™m concerned there™s not
hing I can do because there™s nowhere that I can 
run to.

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And I left him there, I -- feeling terribly gui
lty not -- not to have stayed longer, but we 
couldn™t stay together longer. 

Q: Was he able -- 

A: Not to stay longer, to -- to find a way out.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: My ma in reason for going to officer school wa
s it was safely behind th
e lines [indecipherable] 
and the chances of survival were 90 per
cent. I -- I simply had to survive. 
Q: And you had a choice of what kind of regime nt you were in? 

A: We ll, you can -- no, if they -- they say that yo
u are picked to go, you have to go, but there are 
ma ny reasons why they would go. Some  would fall 
in the river, say oh thank you very much, I 
want to die for Hitler, I want to be an officer 
for Hitler. Others will just stand there, you know, 
say nothing. Command i s  a [ind
ecipherable] command, and t heir system was a command system. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I said -- I said nothing, I just
 said yes. I was actually surpri
sed because I wasn™t fitting in and 
I™d been demoted once for not understanding th
e German well enough, and yet some how they, I 
don™t know -- 

Q: So how do you get demoted fr -- 

A: -- oh, you know why they picked
 me ?  I had -- I was one of the few rema ining who had high 
school graduation, and by the law of induction into 
officer training, you were 
still expect to have 
had at least high school. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
82 
 
A: And I had happened to have had high school, so
 they put me  into, and there were seven or 
eight of us picked.  
Q: You -- 

A: Seven or eight out of 42 gradua
tes, all of whom had perished. 
All the others had already died. 
Q: What was training like? 

A: Training? 

Q: Mm-hm. Was there any? 

A: I me ntioned to you my love of sports
. And I found myself in a nation, in UNRRA 

[indecipherable] bossed around by 
those eight foot tall German
s with shoulders like that, 
waistlines like that, legs like that
, being able to run a hundred yards 
in five seconds or at least so 
they claim. And I said to my
self -- oh, by the way, by that time  I™d already been called Gypsy, 
Balkanaiser, pork eater, bacon 
eater, you name  it [indecipherable] just because of my looks. 
There™s some thing -- and they told me you™ve got
 to be able to prove something, that you™re 
equal and competitive, at least in somethi
ng. So I took them on with their ma rching 10 
kilome ters in 40 mi nutes, with fully -- things 
loaded, I never lagged be
hind. In no time  -- I™m 
very [indecipherable] my hands [indecipherable] I 
was -- in no time I was very, very good at the 
Morse code. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Oh, well, I was in signals. 

Q: Right. 

A: Wi reless. You see, there were signals wire, 
telephone, civil Morse code. Oh, I outdid the Volk 
Germans. There was one Volk German guy by the 
name  of -- what was the name ?  I should know 
[indecipherable]. Anywa y, one, the real Volksd
eutsche, who terribly want s to be like a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
83 
 
Reichsdeutsche. His hair was [indecipherable] lik
e that, he was reddish blonde, blue eyes, big 
nose sticking out, big shoulders, 
and [indecipherable] Nicholas hi
s name  was. And he always 
said, Lally, you™re a ma garoni, you 
just can™t do -- you just can™t to
 it. And I looked and I said, 
you know Nicholas, I proved to you that as a ma gar
oni I can do it. So ou -- 
I beat him every time  
in our speedwriting, in the -- in the signals. That
 was fun. And I beat hi
m every time  in long 
ma rches, and I beat hi m every place else. Here wa
s my personal challenge to prove to me that 
even though in their eyes I was only a Gypsy ki
nd of a looking guy, deep inside myself I was a 
ma n, I was a  huma n being, you know?  And they we
re all smoking [indecipherable] and they 
were all womanizing. Our jackets, the military jack
ets ha d a small pocket on the inside, inside  of 
the left . Condoms. 
Q: Right. 

A: I have no idea where they bought the c
ondom, but -- so the -- the commanding sergeant 
come s and says, this weekend you will be  allowed 
to go out. There are two of them in there, 
make sure that you use them because I™ll -- I™
ll check on you if you did or not because for the 
fuehrer you™ve got to pr oc reate children. No quest
ions about who the girl will be, no question if 
they would be willing or not, 
no question ma rried or not, you™ve
 got to do it. And I had a -- 
gained a good friend, Wa lter Meyhall
owicz, whose grandfather had been Se rb, but who had been 
Germanized because of two Ger man mothers ma
rrying into the clan. He was a tall guy, black, 
black, black, like a Gypsy looking. So we kind of st
uck together because we were -- both looked 
[indecipherable] right? So I looked at -- Wa lter sai
d, what are we going to 
do with that, he says. 
He was two years older, I don™t know if he had e
xperience or not. So he said, we™ll find us a new

End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
84 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
A: So the sports kept me  -- helped me keep my
self in good shape, and I wa s also some how, even 
though I™d been raised very pr -- in a very pr
otective environment -- we had a ma id, we had a 
junior ma id, we had the [indeciphe
rable], the Jack of all trades 
ma n. We were not allowed to do 
physical labor. I was never allowed to go to the 
kitchen because [indecipherable] all that stuff, 
right? I didn™t know -- 
I didn™t learn how to fend for myself.  
Q: You didn™t? 
A: No, I hadn™t. But then, in the army  your rations
 aren™t really adequate
 if you want to keep 
your body in good shape. So some where along the lin
e observing others, and there was an older 
Volksdeutsche, a ba -- farmer, who r eally knew
 how to find potatoes and things like that, so I 
was learning very, very quickly. 
And on the front I always knew how
 to have a few extra morsels 
of bread in my pocket, like to chew at. And I al
ways knew how to have extra newspapers to wrap 
around my feet, because the German boots were to
tally pervious to cold [indecipherable] you 
had frozen feet in no time. But we discovered if 
you wrap them in paper on top at -- on top of the 
sock, your chances were 90 percen
t better of not gett
ing your toes freeze -- fro-frozen off. 
Q: Right. 

A: And with that you some how learned how to
 handle life, even in the most difficult 
circumstances. And again, not smoking was a very 
great contributor to be
ing able to develop 
some kind of resistance against th
e terrible cold in Yugoslavia, a
nd then also on the southeastern 
front; 40 below zero in that, you know?  And it -- I 
had this extra energy 
also because of the 
[indecipherable] rations. To go th
rough the darkest times and alwa
ys kind of wanting to show 
that even though you guys think I™m an unterme n -- in my eyes I™m not an unterme nschen. I 

didn't want to prove that I was a Nazi. I would 
never want to be a Nazi
. I didn™t look like one, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
85 
 
right? Or behave like one. But I wanted to prove
 I™m a huma n being, I shouldn™t be looked down 
at. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And a very as -- na -- strong motivating factor
 was that we were compe lled to read the ﬁMein 
Ka mpfﬂ. We  were compe lled to 
read the what, the f -- the mi  -- m- me -- me  -- ma ma -- ﬁThe 
Mythos of the 20
th
 Century,ﬂ by Rosenberg, right?  And we were compelled to enjoy 
indoctrination every day, all with the same  thing, 
heil Hitler this, heil Hitler that. But they will 
never have an opportunity to do anything with th
e brains that we stil
l had for purposes of 
learni ng. And some where in my mi nd there was 
-- an increasing part of my brain had became 
completely aloof against thei r attempts to 
take my mi nd over completely and ma ke me  

completely embrace their serial ideology. And one of the clinching mo ments came  when the 

officer investigating my racial 
purity told me  who I would have 
to get ma rried to. Cause it ma y 
not be important to you, it ma y not be important ove
rall within the context 
of the Holocaust, but 
some where in my mi nd there was enough of a defens
ive mec hanism in which the I wanted to be 
me , and in which there was still 
enough scope left for the brain to fill in the void and to undo the 
dama ge caused to the other part, whic
hever it was, the left or the right. 
Q: So -- 

A: And the killing in the panzergraben was a se
cond ma jor determining for that. You see, I still 
ask myself how come  I knew, afte
r witnessing all that k
illing, after losing most
 of my friends in 
the war, after witnessing some  of
 the atrocities, including some  -- a couple of Ger mans  had their 
genital parts cut off by partisan fema le. Another 
partisan female had a big stick stuck into her 
[indecipherable]. After witnessing 
all that and becomi ng complete
ly immune to any perception 
of morality, how come  I knew when Viel was 
doing the killing, that it was wrong? But I knew it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
86 
 
was wrong, but I was so terribly 
scared at the same  ti me . I kne
w it was wrong. I was scared. So I 
was just petrified. What do you do 
with that?  So, just like my dad when Dr. Wr ight came, I 
decided nothing -- I decided I do nothing, becauseI wanted to survive. And I talked to Rabbi 
Poupko about that, a very senior 
conservative rabbi in Montreal
. I asked him, what would you 
have done, Rabbi?  He l-liked my testimony, he liked
 my -- he said, Adal -- al -- Lallier, you 
really have courage. I said, it™s 
not courage, it is [indecipherable]
. We ll, I say it™s courage. I say, 
what would you have done?  He said, in the eyes 
of the Jewish interpre
tation of God, one™s own 
life always come s first. Now, I don™t know if he told 
me  that, if it™s true or not, or if he told me  
that to appease me , to decrease my pain or my
 agony, but he told me , you were absolutely right 
trying to si -- preserve
 your life, assumi ng that would have
 become a creative life. You didn™t 
want to waste that. And he sai
d, the fact alone that you finally 
decided to speak up proves that 
you were right in keeping your mout h shut, beca
use if you hadn™t, they would you put a -- put 
you up on the spot and shot you. So, good excuse, but I still did nothing. 
Q: But -- 
A: Why didn™t my father try to get us away? 
Maybe because he wouldn™
t have had -- oh who -- 
who -- wh-who -- I don™t know, there were no airpla
ne, there were no flights out. Would have to 
be -- I don™t know, there were no 
boats on which to go, we were in
 the central Europe. So how 
do you get away over three or four, 500 kilome ters 
of -- of territory that
 be longed to the Hitler 
Germans?  How do you do it?  I-I don™t know.  

Q: Well, let™s go back and tal -- 
and tell me a little bit more a
bout what the -- the training, the 
ideoli -- ideological training 
was like. You were all forced to read ﬁMein Kampf.ﬂ 
A: We  were all -- we were given lectures, 
ideological lectures. Weltanschauung, you can write 
that down, but the term is well known. We ltanschauung. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
87 
 
Q: Right. 
A: You know that from philosophy, right. We lta
nschauung was an obligatory course throughout 
the four and a half months tr
aining of Pinuna. And the weltansc
hauung is really teaching us how 
to take the oath of fealty to Hitler, not quest
ion anything about that a
nd -- and to exercise com-
complete commitment to the oath, 
even willingness to die for it. 
Q: And wha t  was the oath? 

A: And that was -- we had the 
physical training -- I -- I liked 
the physical training. But what I 
liked about the physical training 
is to find out that I too, comi ng from the nowhere, could do it 
almost as well, even better than some of 
the German Ger mans did. And that™s where the 

Olympian image rose in my mi nd, you see. 

Q: But were you feeling conflicted bei
ng in -- in what is a Nazi group? 
A: No, no, I was -- 

Q: I mean the Waffen SS is a Nazi -- 
A: -- I was -- no, no, they were Wa lter Meyhollo
wicz was a may -- racially mi xed. He never 
became a Lowd Nicholas. Lowd Nicholas coul dn™t become  a Nazi fast enough. 
Q: I -- well, yeah, well I don™t -- I don™t mean 
that everybo -- every person like you wa s a Nazi, 
but it™s a Nazi division. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right?  Did that feel very conflicting to you 
to be in some thing like that?  I me an, we re you 
yourself torn -- 

A: You mea n -- no, I -- that -- no, th
-the -- already -- I™ve come  a 
-- already on record saying that 
when they finally -- and I™m
 kind of jumping now -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
88 
 
A: -- eventually the oath of fealty wa
s taken for the division as a whole -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and for the signals [i ndeci
pherable] battalion as a whole. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And I have reasons to believe that I was the 
only one who said quietly, so that no one would 
hear me , instead of I swear the honor of H
itler, I sweared the Miklós Hort-Horthy. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So I -- I pled my f- f -- oath of 
allegiance to a guy that I believed in. 
Q: But not [indecipherable] 

A: See, in that sense I was an exception. And 
alone saying Horthy, I was not professing myself 
on behalf of Nazism, but Horthy-ism. But Ho
rthy-ism too, on hindsight, was a semi -feudal 
Fascistic state -- state of mi nd, with an absolute 
dictator on the top. But it was not based on racial 
impurities or  -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- racial discrimi nation and th
at. It was just Hungarianism, 
but I was very -- I was feeling 
happy with that, but I was also feel
ing happy that nobody had overheard me . 
Q: Right. But you also had to read 
Rosenberg, who was clearly a racist. 
A: Oh, on Rosenberg we were not read, 
but we were read excerpts to -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- during the weltanschauung. 

Q: So did you then learn what the 
racial feeling of Nazism was ?  
A: We ll, we were -- we were being told. L
earning means you are taught how to think for 
yourself. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
89 
 
Q: No, no, not necessarily. I mean, s o me times -- 
A: Oh well, my interpre tation -- 

Q: -- it can be bad learning. 

A: I brought you a printout
 of my appointment as
 a full professor -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- in which I speak about the teacher and l
earning. Anyway, to use th
at term in quotation 
ma rks then, right. 

Q: Right. 

A: We ll, they™re trying -- they were t-telling us -- 

Q: What -- 

A: -- how to see things. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the only way to see things properly wa
s the way they were telling us. I reme mber a 
philosophy professor [indecipherable] some  year
s ago, appearing and saying Lallier, when I go 
to my classroom I tell them, I a m the  one who know
s it all, on th -- only to listen to me . I™ll 
examine you on those questions and you™ll know it all. 
So I™m the one that you have to repeat in 
order to pass. Sa me  thing there. 

Q: Right. 

A: But this guy was in a democrat -- by the way, 
he happens to be an American who didn™t want 
to go to Vietnam.  

Q: Did most of the -- 

A: Anyways, he ra 
--  he raised that . 

Q: -- did the most of the guys with you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
90 
 
A: Sorry? 
Q: Did most of the guys with you in the regi
me nt -- in the division rather, believe -- 
A: We ll, I-I have to be specific on that. 

Q: -- what they were t -- 

A: First of all, not all graduates of the ha -- 
German high school were of
 intellectual or bourgeois 
stock. About 80 percent of th
em were a peasant stock. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So they knew th -- knew the stuff they had to
 learn to earn their dipl
oma, but they were not 
really literate persons who could think for them
s e lves. And I say that -- most of those of the 
peasant stock fell completely, wholesale for what
 the Nazis were feeding them. And  Lowd was 
one par -- very particular example. You see -- 

Q: Wa s there a Wa ffen SS song? 

A: Be -- sorry? 
Q: By the way, was there a Wa ffen SS song that was 
sung?  Some thing like if
 others prove I™m tr 
-- 
A: The Wa ffen SS by that time had become  a propaganda tool by which they were hoping to 

entice the physically more capable and me ntally more alert to volunteer for 
service on behalf of -
- and I™m being very formal in that -- on beha
lf of defending western ci
vilization against godless 
commu -- see, I still have it in my bl ood. At the sa
me  ti me , since the really noble ones fit in that 
perfect image were being killed in Russia left, 
right and center, they badl y needed replacements, 
so in no time, by mi d-1940 th-the standards were
 being reduced. No mo
re [indecipherable] 76. 
No more shoulders like that, waistlines 32, feet
 like that and [indeci
pherable] like that and 
blonde and all that. They were 
taking left, right and center. A
nd more and more of the small 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
91 
 
Mediterranean, Gypsy looking types were got 
-- gotten in. More and more compromi sing 
admi ssions by people of half blood, that first of 
all, you had to have half blood, then you had to 
have quarter blood, the-then you said, unless ther
e was a Jewish grandmother you™ll be taken 
whatever your blood com -- blood combination is
. But one restriction rema ined. You shouldn™t 
have had a Jewish grandmother. And even that 
restriction was eventually raised, right? O-Or 
erased. But I reme mber you had to go back seve
n generations to prove 
it -- prove that you™re 
pure Aryan. But all that -- most of
 that had fallen by wayside mi d-1943.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And the existence of the Wa ffen SS [indeci
pherable] commissione [indecipherable] was only 
[indecipherable], which even today™s Wa ffen 
SS veterans™ paper keeps on emphasizing. They 
have a publication, every month cal
ling -- calling it ﬁThe Volunteer.
ﬂ And they still believe that 
fact is a -- a hundred percent 
of those who have been in 
the Waffen SS were volunteer. 
Q: We re volunteers. 
A: 20 percent were perhaps volunteers. 
Q: So you still get their newsletter? 

A: So I was feeling -- I -- no.  

Q: Yeah -- no. 

A: But I have an American friend who interestingly is some how ena mored with -- a very highly 

positioned federal -- federal employee in the west
ern part of the United St ates, very hi ghly 
positioned, who had written a hi story on the milder, 
non-criminal parts of the Wa ffen SS, name ly 
the -- the si gnals formations, and til -- for what 
I recall, the si gnal formations never even ever 
raised a weapon against anybody, because my job -- our
 job was to be there and pl ay with this 
thing. There ma y have been shooting at [indeci
pherable] once in awhile. Anyway, he wrote a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
92 
 
book about the Wa ffen SS signals [i
ndecipherable]. And it is from that -- and he asked me  to 
read through that, I me t him through some body else. 
And out of that I retrieved [indecipherable] 
information, the list of those who had been in th
e concentration camps, and 
I didn™t tell him that, 
it™s none of his business. I mea
n, I™m free to do with that, unle
ss I want to republish the whole 
thing, in which case I™d have to me ntion his name , see? 
Q: Right. 

A: But -- 

Q: So did they ti -- 

A: -- he is an American, he™s -- I find him a bit 
strange. He is not a Nazi, 
but he believes a -- he 
fall -- fell for that  slogan that the Wa ffen SS 
[indecipherable]. I™ve be
en writing innume rous 
proof to the contrary, but he is an [indeciphe
rable] and -- but he ha
d ma de  a significant 
contribution exploring a subject, 
and being able to distinguish th
e evil ones from the not so 
committed ones to the ones who were there agains
t thei r will, but who some how seemed to have 
survived the war, even though serving agai
nst their will or so
me thing like that.  
Q: Did they teach you to s -- 

A: But he hasn™t written me  since 
my  last letter in which I -- I to
ld him, absolutely told him, you 
finally have to get away from 
the lie that the Volksdeutsche we
re volunteers. He would norma lly 
write me four times -- once every four  weeks, 
but I haven™t heard of him for the past eight 
weeks, so maybe he found that my attitude 
was becomi ng too pushy [indecipherable] speaking 
the truth. But he™s an o -- he™s 
an okay guy. He™s an okay American. 
Q: Did they -- did they teach you to shoot? 

A: And he told me  he™s going to vote for -- for 
Oba ma, so I don™t know if that ma kes him more 
okay or not. Sorry? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
93 
 
Q: Did they teach you to shoot? 
A: Oh yes. We also -- we had 
the signals training, we had the 
ideological training, we had the 
physical training, which I absolutely was very ha
ppy with, and we have the skills training. The -- 
all the weapons you can possibly ima g
ine in -- from the pistols, fo
r would be officers eventually, 
it™s essential training. You had th
e carbine, which carbine question came  up during the court, 

because I insisted it was the [indecipherable] car
bine and some of the Nazi Germans counter-
insisted that the Wa ffen SS had never had [indeci
pherable] carbine, but th
e judge graciously -- 
Wi nkler, took my explanation, havi
ng discovered through some  not N
azi experts that they were 
Czech carbines, which we ma y have been using the
n, or he ma y have been able to use. And we 
had the Mitryettes, and we 
had especially the Sturmgew
ehr. Sturmgewehr was a 1944 
production, very similar to the Soviet AK 457 whic
h could spit out, I think 57 bullets, smaller 
bullets, in about three seconds, 
or some thing like that. And then
 we had also shooting with -- 
with -- what you call those 
little pipes?  Mortars? 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we had grenade shooting and we had special
 traini ng ones, they became quite frequently 

distributed, the anti-tank weapons. The Pan
zerakate and they ca
ll it [indecipherable] 
Q: But you were not -- you were not then put into
 a regime nt to shoot, you were -- you were -- 
you were -- 

A: No, no, no, I was not in an infantry regime nt. 

Q: Right. 

A: I was strictly tied to the headquarters of 
the division communicate -- in communications.  
Q: And whe r e was -- 

A: Only two times was I engaged in active two week warfare -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
94 
 
Q: And whe r e was -- 
A: -- against the Russians. 

Q: Against the Russians. 

A: That was -- yeah, again, that was in Octobe
r 1944, in which we hadn™
t really learned -- we 
had followed the partisans, we had not -- not been engaged at the headquarters level in facing 

any [indecipherable] formations with T -- T34 ta
nks and the whole bit th
e Soviets were throwing 
at us, and in three days of fi
ghting we lost 90 percent of everything. We  lost 90 percent of our 
trucks. My truck was the only one to have surv
ived the -- the ma ssacre [indecipherable] because 

I was skillful enough -- I was the driver -- I was 
skillful enough to hide it behind a chur ch, and I 
was lucky enough to have escaped being directly s
hot at by -- I was -- had to cross a bridge, and 
that -- right to bridge there we
re dozens of Ger ma n vehicles de
stroyed by anti-tank fire, and I 
was next in line to be shot at
. And I had my five guys including 
my [indecipherable] in the truck, 
and I was driving like a ma dman, trying to hit 
the bridge, but before I ma de a sharp turn, I 
decided to stop just for a brief mo me nt, I don™t k
now what made me  stop. 
And at that mome nt I 
stopped the shot of the anti-tank weapon buzzed bythe front of the windshield of the car. And 

then I just so -- noticed that, 
they needed about 17 seconds for a second shot and I accelerated 

and got away. I was the only funkwagen who wa
s saved from the whol
e division. The division 
had 37 of wireless communication trucks. 

Q: And they were all -- 

A: They all got perished and about 2500 guys died
 in three days, including a guy by the name  of 
Lisi, who stuck his neck out in front of the truc
k, was hit in chest on with
 the grenade, he just 
disintegrated. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
95 
 
A: He was one of the very gifted high school
 graduates and he was a bourgeois son, he was a 
very nice guy who was -- who was there I thi
nk for defending his motherland and his father™s 
properties from communism, a
nd he was not a Nazi. But Lowd Nicholas was a Nazi. 
Q: And whe r e -- after your 
tra -- how ma -- how many week
s were you in training?   
A: We were trained until for th
e first of June -- actually, 15
th
 of June, first of June I was drafted, 
15
th
 of June we were sent up to [i
ndecipherable] and we were sent 
back down, totally contrary to 
our expectations because we thought
 we™d be enga ging against the Soviets, they sent  us  down to 
Serbia to fight the partisans who had by that 
time become  very nume rous. Because as you know, 
Hitler™s having invaded the Soviet Union, Tito
 immediately declared 
war on the Germans under 
horrendous, horrendous circumstances for the par
tisans because they were nobodies, they had 
nothing, and yet they survived some how. Tito is to me  a -- a rema rkable ma n, the wa y he took on 

the Nazis, but he also let his people suffer because it was beca use of the 
odd -- killing of some  
odd German soldier, the Germans we re ha
nging hundreds and hundreds of innocent Serb 
civilians. And Tito added to power, exterminated
 the whole Yugoslav -- 
the whole -- 
the entire 
Yugoslav bourgeoisie. You see, Tito is a ma jor 
was criminal, but without Tito the war couldn™t 
have been won the way it has won, so I™m kind 
of caught in between. One of my big images 
about that he -- from the war is an image that 
I retrieved from a book written by one of Tito™s p-

primary assistants [indecipherable] Angelis. Y
ou ma y have he ard of Milo Angelis. He had a 
book on wartime me mor a  -- me mor -- me mor -- me moirs in which on one particular cage -- 

page, there is a Serb young ma n about 18 years ol
d, with a typical Serb 
cap, dressed like a poor 
peasant, standing under the gallows with that Ge
rman officers surrounding him. And just before 
he died, he raised his hand like th
at, and he died like that. Now, if
 I ever wanted to have a photo 
over which I™d cry about the absolute courage in 
the face of actual power, that guy is my hero in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
96 
 
my mi nd. He was a total anti-Nazi, he  who died because he be lieve d that what Germa ns were 
doing was wrong. Trouble is his death was caused 
by T-Tito™s partisan killing one or two 
Germans. And this guy was rounded up in a small village chacha and hanged with ma ny of the 

others. 

Q: But you want to blame ti -- 

A: An unfor gettable picture. 

Q: -- you want to blame T
ito and not the Nazis? 
A: Sorry? 

Q: Do you want to blame Tito and not the Wa ffen SS? 

A: No, no, no, I am bla ming the Nazis. 

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: They had no right to captur
e the 200, right? At the same  ti
me , a mongst the 200, there was one 
who dared raised hi s fist and tell the Germans 
face to face before they ha nged him, but they 
didn™t prove me rciful. They™re being told [indeciphe
rable] that you™re dead
 wrong, you™re killers.  
Q: When -- 

A: I should send you that picture, perhaps. 

Q: Mm. When -- when you were in the Wa ffe
n SS in yu -- in the former Yugoslavia -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- in Serbia, did you know wh
at Pri-Prince Eugen regime nts 
were doing, the division was 
doing in Yugoslavia? 

A: Oh, well, in the -- in the -- 

Q: I mean, what sort of reports -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
97 
 
A: -- we were the center of co
mmuni cation and our ma jor task was to communicate between the 
various parts of the division, the various battal
ions and regime nts about how to arrange the 
warfare against the pa rtisans.  

Q: But it was only -- 

A: So it was strictly, strictly for two and a ha
lf years, from September 1942 to October 1944, we 

were engaged strictly agai
nst the partisans,
 under murderous circumstances. 
Q: So you -- 

A: We  had no idea, because we are too far away in
 the center, no idea what atrocities were being 
committed by the vari ous -- by the two regiments, or the two battalions, the various battalions. 

Q: So you didn™t -- 

A: But we did drive through villages that had been
 completely destroyed, and we knew that that 
is the pr ice that the Serbs were -- most of the pa
rtisans were Se rbs, right -- the Serbs we re payi  -- 
paying for what they were trying to do to theGermans and those were the [indecipherable] that 
the German Nazis were imposing upon them, finding 
two or three partisan that -- even burn the 
whole village. And that was a fact
 of life of war, but that™s th
e way I -- my interpretation was, 
that is what the war is about. But deep inside
 myself I always knew that the Germans had no 
business being in the Balkans, because I had ca
rried forward, for me , 
the recognition when the 
Germans oc cupied Austria, it was upsetting hi
story upside-down. The Germans had no business 

being in Austria, but the fact is
, it was absolute power and I™d 
become  part and parcel of the 
absolute power. So in a certain sense I wa
s directly underwriting th
e absolute power by 
communicating me ssages. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
98 
 
A: But since I didn™t see the destruction and dying 
in front of my eyes, this -- I kind of -- th-they 
rema ined kind of aloof of that. So I was only a co
mmunicator and not an executor. But all of that 
came forcefully, right in front of my eyes because
 of Viel and his killing in the panz ergraben. 
Q: So do you think in the -- some  way you b
ecame  numb during that
 period in Serbia? 
A: Yeah, one th -- one -- one become s -- you se
e one death your -- you vom -- excuse me , you -- 
you vomit. 

Q: Right. 

A: You see two de -- two dead, you vomit ma ybe 
a couple of time s later. You see 10 dead -- 
Q: You stop. 

A: -- you have a look and say, well [indecipherable] 
this is my friend. And if the friend is still 
alive, you quickly go there and hope that you can talk 
to him or soothe him, or talk to him or his 
mother or some thing like that to ma ke him die in peace. If you see a hundred dead, hanging, 

which I had before they drafted me  -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- you™d see, well, if these we
re my people, what would I do w
ith them?  I™d take them off the 
hangers, I suppose and I™d give them a d
ecent burial, that™s all that we can do. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: What happened to all those pe
ople in the church, burned to th
e stake, who felt that it was 
wrong?  They had no choice just to bury them qui
etly, didn™t they?  I™m not
 absolving Nazis of 
their guilt. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
99 
 
A: But the hanging, the burning, how far back doe
s that go into history?  And why would an 
educated nation like the Germans, the highest propor
tion of PhDs of any of
 the nations of that 
time, follow a pattern of medieval sa
vagery?  How does one explain that?   
Q: Because a PhD doesn™t prot ect you -- 
A: Yeah, well, well -- well -- 

Q: -- clearly. So you -- you we
re in the Wa ffen SS in th
e Prince Eugen re-regiment? 
A: Yeah, I was in the Waffen SS - -  

Q: Was that in ™42 to f -- 

A: -- but please don™t forget, the Wa
ffen SS was the seventh division. 
Q: Right. 

A: We still were given the Wa
ffen SS blood group tattooed in. 
Q: Oh, you were. 

A: But we were never given a Wa ffe n SS numbe r , 
because to be trul y a Waffen SS officer, you 
have to have your numbe r. 

Q: No numb er, uh-huh. 

A: So if you would call that a gross act of disc
rimination, call it that. I don
™t view it like that, 
only [indecipherable] say it as a pr
oof, they needed cannon fodder -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- they got the cannon fodder by force, withou
t giving them equal lega
l protection. They had 
even promised German c itizenship. None of the surviving me mbers of the Prince Eugen got the 

citizenship unless they qualified by living in Germ
any a fter the war for five years. So did they 
treat the [indecipherable] as untermenschen? I want
 to go on official record, they treated the -- 
Reichs Germans treated the Volksdeutsche defin
itely as unterme nschen and repeatedly called 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
100 
 
them speck-fresser, bacon eaters and sigoina and 
balkinazer, including myself. And it was so bad 
that the highest commander with -- of the Waff
en SS, the SS [indecipherable] haupter eventually 
had to pass an order all the way down asking 
the offi cers to finally put a st op to these 
discrimi nating references to the Volksdeutsche. 
And why that command?  Because they still had 
a hundred thousand Volksdeutsche that
 they haven™t drafted yet and th
at they didn™t want to lose. 
The bodies, they were needed to fight th-the  S
oviets in the conditions of increasing despair. 
Q: Now, you were promoted twice, am I right? 
A: We ll, I was promoted with everybody else, firs
t to Sturmi n and then to [indecipherable] yeah. 
Q: Right. 

A: I wasn™t promoted out of ranks. Actually, my
 first promotion, so-called, was delayed because 
after they we re sent down -- I was very good in si
gnaling, in my Morse codes, so I wa s picked to 
be amongst the first group to be sent on to Se
rbia. And I was standing -- like I was sent on two 
weeks before the second group was to follow, it 
was a stage, kind of transportation of troops, 
20,000 plus me n. And I was up standing night guard ove
r my teraf -- my  -- my -- my  Morse code 
machine, and suddenly a phone call came  in by so
mebody with a guttural German and gave me a 

command that I didn™t understand. And you can™t sa
y, excuse me  please, would you repeat that?  
And I said, Jawohl, and I did nothing. The followi
ng day the sergeant in charge called me  and 
says, Lallier, as of imme diately, you are demote
d to become  a muli-fuehrer. A muli-fuehrer was 
a -- a mule attendant. So, with my glorious know
l-knowledge of m -- the Morse codes, whatever 

they would be, it would have been
 useful, I found myself in a st
all with about 300 mu li -- mules 
and mule attendants, about 30 of them, none of th
em having finished even elementary school. All 
of them havi ng great hands, great backs, great un
derstanding of their -- 
of their animals, but I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
101 
 
must ma ybe worriedly say, because it sound like 
discrimi nation, not muc h of a developed brain 
power. 
Q: We  have to stop there. 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
102 
 
Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: You were a muli-fuehrer after SS ma n? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you were a muli-fuehrer for six weeks? 

A: No, I was a SS ma n while being a muli-fuehrer.  

Q: Oh, you were both at the same  time ?  

A: There was no promotion. If you™re a muli-fuehrer you get no promotion. 

Q: I see.  

A: Until November 1942. And then they picked 
me up because they thought I may have some 
brains because they must have looked at my hi
gh school certificate gradua
te [indecipherable] so 
put me  into training as a truck driver. 

Q: As a truck driver. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay. In 1942, when you were -- between ™42 and ™44 -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- the end of ™44, you were f -- 

A: I was in the Balkans. 

Q: -- in the Balkans. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you hear anything about 
what was going on in the east? 
A: No, there was no -- 

Q: Did you -- did you know about killing centers?  

A: -- no, we were --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
103 
 
Q: No. 
A: -- so busy fighting the Titoists who were be
comi ng more and more numerous because of the 
German stupid policies of fighting the whole popul
ation. We had the position like in Iraq. In or d 
-- in -- in order to -- instead of ma king the 
population love you by bei
ng good to them and not 
hanging them, they did exactly the opposite, ri
ght?  It became slow work, and the German 
command always referred to the partisans as band
its. Bandits who are f -- waging illegal warfare, 
totally cont rary to international agreements, right? 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: And disagreement about the bandits, internati
onal, goes back about 150 years, without the 
question ever being asked first, 
well what are the c
ountries doing in thos
e countries in which 
these bandits emerged in the first place.  

Q: Mm-hm. So -- 

A: I am very concerned about, you know, intern
ational dipl omacy, because that thing about 
banditry in occupied countries is a direct 
consequence of the imperial party -- including 
[indecipherable] Austria-Hungar
y, having conspired to look at local uprises against foreign 
domi nation as an illegal act at th
e me rcy of countries that occupi
ed the country. It™s not right. 
Q: Right. 

A: Anyway,  so we were there fi
ghting the partisans, totally purs
uing this Iraqi type of policy, I 
must say honestly in -- in Iraq and -- and in a --
 and in a -- in -- in Vietnam for merly, and it was 
hopeless because the more you hang the more 
young people would say, we don™t want these 
bloody bastards and we were part 
and parcel of the bastards. So eventually we had to keep on 
retreating, retreating and 
treating because the Germans were 
doing badly, justifiably so, and the 
Soviets finally, the U-Ukrainian front, about
 three million me n broke through 150,000 German 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
104 
 
line, some  of it being kept open by the Prince 
Eugen, two or 3,000 rema ining me n, s o we were 
retreating like mad. I still had my -- my communi
cation truck. I was taking care of the truck 
because if you have a truck you can get away
 mu ch faster than running for your life. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So slowly but steadily we moved towards Cr
oatia, the then Croatia, 
today Croatia. And once 
we reached the rina dr i -- th-the river Drina,
 I got the call with the six ot her guys from the 
remnants of the graduates, the high school gradua
tes that we™ll be comma nded as of tomorrow to 
go through Vienna to Nuremberg to officers™ sc
hool. Oh, I never got any me dals, by the way. 

Q: You were commande d to go to officers™ school? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And wha t  was -- 

A: I was -- yeah, I was picked up, this 
was mi d-December 1944, on the -- on taking back. 
Q: So the German are -- the Germans are lo
sing but you™re now sent to officers™ school? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And why ?   

A: Don™t forget -- no, no, no -- 

Q: What did -- what -- 

A: -- don™t forget, we were fighting the Soviets -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- we were being heavily decima ted. 

Q: Right. 

A: There were only six or seven high school gr
aduates left. The German officers corps in the 
Waffen SS was heavily depleted -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
105 
 
Q: Right. So they wanted to -- 
A: -- by all those [indecipherable]. So they need
ed any garbage. And for the first time they 
declared themselves that even Volksdeutsche so-called, an honorary Volksdeutsche would be 

picked -- 

Q: To what? 

A: -- as possible candidate, but they
 were put in through the first phas
e very rigorously is to sort 
them out, if they would found -- be found unquali
fied to become  Ger man officers, right? 
Q: So do you -- 

A: And so I was one of the six or seven. 

Q: So you go to officers™ school? 

A: We ll, yeah, th-they call it cadet school. 

Q: Cadet school? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Where was this? 
A: Oh, the cadet school was supposed to have be
en in Nuremberg, so we took -- we took a train 
ride from Cr oatia through Zagr
eb to Vienna, from Vienna to
 Nuremberg. We arrived in 
Nuremberg two days after 2,000 allied planes had 
bombed the whole city to the smithereens, 

killing 35,000 unsuspecting pro-Nazi Nurembergese
, right?  And we stayed there for two days 
picking up -- they used phosphor bombs. Would 
you want to know what a body looks like after it 
got burned up?  No, I wouldn™t -- I™ll
 tell you. Facial feat
ures rema in exactly the same  except they 
are charcoal black. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
106 
 
A: And the bodies are [indecipherabl e]. So we 
were picking them by the thousands and putting 
them into a pyre and burning eventu
ally to the -- into ashes. 
Q: Right. 
A: And after two days the cleara
nce came. Oh, they also droppe
d the bomb and a -- an air mi ne, 
which was a new invention. An air mine can destr
oy by air pressure, a thou
sand people in an area 
of about 100 square feet, and they dropped 
an air mi ne onto the 
SS luncheon barracks.  
Q: Hm. 

A: There were about a thousand SS 
personnel and all of them died 
with their eyes
 blown out of 
their heads because of the air pr essure, and we 
had to clean up that me ss. Anyway, the -- we 
weren™t in the area, that was tw
o days before. And then we were told we would go by lorry from 
Nuremberg directly into Chekia to go to Leitm
eritz, because the officers™ school, including the 
first stage, name ly the cadet qualification pa
rt would have been delodged from Nure mberg, 
which was totally destroyed, to Leitmeritz, wh
ich was safely in the background from all 
activities, even though th
e Soviets had broken through, they were
 still 200 kilome ters away. So 
Walter and I, he was in the group, he looked at me  a
nd I looked at him, says, gee, we™ll finally be 
safe. We ™ll finally survive. And then, on the way 
over, about 12 kilome ters outside of Leitmeritz 
on the -- still on the western side, 
the [indecipherable] from the we
st, suddenly we™re told, augen 
nach links. Eyes to the left. Varoon, why?  Juden 
-- I reme mb er the off suf -- off sub officer -- 
Q: They said Juden? 

A: Yeah, just said Juden. [speaks German here
]. You are not allowed to look. To retain our 
purity as Aryan officer candidate
s, I suppose, right?  You mus t n™
t look at the [indecipherable] 
Q: Yes, but Waffen SS were 
also in concentration camps. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
107 
 
A: We ll yes, but not the real 
Wa ffen SS. The concentration ca
mp guards, not Wa ffen SS, they 
were special guards, if you know the SS [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 

A: But there were Wa ffe n SS personnel -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- amongst them who had been wounded, w
ho had even volunteered, or who had been 
otherwise assigned in admi nistrative posts. If
 you go through the lists you will disc over that, 
right, right? 

Q: But you couldn™t let -- 

A: So I -- I beg your pardon ma ™am, SS, con
centration camp guards were me mbers of the 
Allgemeine SS. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The Wa ffen SS were supposedly, 99 percent of th
e time, 99 percent of th
eir -- of their per -- 
presence as soldiers, preoccupied to
 fight in the east and the west. 
Q: But you™re being ironic. 

A: But about 600 of them over the course of the th
ree, four years of the 
war did do service in the 
concentration camps.  

Q: Do you think -- 

A: And we went directly to th
e officers™ school, and the first tim
e it hits us, Juden, the question 
came up between Wa lter and I, what™s that? And 
being young me n who had survived three years 
of partisan warfare, we™d say [indecipherable] 
Juden?  Why aren™t we allowed to look?  And we 
arrived in Le itmeritz with that question, and 
eventually -- that wa
s end of January 1945. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
108 
 
A: By mi d-March we knew. 
Q: What did you know? 

A: The concentration camp. 

Q: You knew that it was a camp, I get it.  

A: Because on the 18
th
 of March, we arise in the morning at
 five o™clock and told, you are going 
to go on guard duty, eight to nine kilometers 
away. You™ve got to line up immediately with 
weapons which we will distribute to you, because  
weapons were not generally dist ributed unless 
you were on the front lines, right, we™ll give th
e weapons to you, we will
 board the lorries and 
we™ll drive westward to pick up prisoners. And af
ter driving for about th
ree-quarters of an hour 
we suddenly see a fortress-like building. Manifesto, 
small fortress. And all kinds of activities in 
front around six -- 6:30 in the morning on the 18
th
, right? And Waffen -- and SS guards comi ng 
out and prisoners -- and prisoner of war comi ng out
. I think all of them, with the Jewish and -- 
you see, and then we said to ourself, what™s
 that?  And then Viel, who was our commanding 
officer, concentration camp Theresienstadt, ou
r duty is to supervise 1500 to 2,000 inmates 
digging an anti-tank ditch, which the high command 
thought would have to be dug to hold back 
the Soviet tanks from a breakthrough. Suddenly, 
two things realized upon us. Number one, we 
had to supervise prisoners, which is not what of
ficers are trained to do. O
fficer training is to 
become  offi cers to fight the commies. Not be
ing [indecipherable] you looked at those people 
they were ragged, they were kind 
of -- th-th-th--their -- their -- 
their -- to -- clothing was kind of 
all torn up, they were starving looking, they were
 t-totally inwarded l
ooking. They were kind -- 
barely able to walk. And we were -- forgive me  
for saying that -- we were
 representatives of a 
mi ghty ideology, right, fighting the communists and 
that, we should be on the front. And serious 

questions we re raised, but you were given th
e command, so they were comi ng out, 1500 to 2,000 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
109 
 
of them and we were si -- surrounded and ma
rched with them where the commanding officer was 
-- told him to march. Concentra
tion camp, for the first time. And only then did we know that 
there were actually two concentration camps
, Theresienstadt, the model camp, which the 
Germans we re showing off to the Red Cross volunteers. 
Q: But that™s only for a few days. 

A: And the smaller -- 

Q: It™s -- it™s only a model for a few days. 

A: Well -- well -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- get technical now. All I re
me mber is that I had read a 
book by a guy name  of Adler, who 
was in Theresienstadt, who was ab
le to survive that, who wrote a 
couple of chapters in the book, 
ﬁTheresi enstadtﬂ -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- a reference to the Red Cr
oss commissioners being told a
nd being displayed the Jewish 
people happy like a lark. And -- but
 we didn™t know about that. Bu
t what we did know is that 
there was the Theresiensta
dt with about 10 to 15 thousand pers
ons and the kleine feste with two 
to 2,000 to 2,500. And the kleine feste, one rumor ha
d it, were destined to be exterminated, but 
they also contained non-Jewish pe
ople. Some  Soviet prisoner of 
war who had gotten -- got even 
some Britishers, I al so understand even an Australi
an was locked up in the kleine fe st e. Anyway, 

it was the killing grounds, and it is 
those people that we are to supe
rvise. So we did. On the first 
day nothing untoward happened. They 
had equipment, it is not true that they did it with their 
hands and -- and then [indecipherable] had the ap
propriate shovels and that
, but we were spaced 
every 20 me ters on both sides of 
the ditch, get -- becomi ng deeper
 and deeper. But on the second 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
110 
 
day we were brought back and that™s at -- now
, lunch at two o™clock, 
Viel suddenly started 
shooting, where I was standing. 

Q: Viel started shooting. Did y -- 

A: Ah, yeah. We  were -- we had talked about 
the service [indecipherabl
e] guard service, and 
very, very unhappy because some of the soldiers claime d they 
had gotten me dals of heroism 
fighting the commies and that a
nd suddenly they™re only prison gua
rds. It was not compatible 
which wa -- what we thought was th
e eth -- ethics of the internati
onal recognized ethical form of 
behavioral officers. But we didn™t ask any que
stions. The questions would be asked on the 
following day in the evening when, 
after having witnessed and/or he
ard the killing and pointed at 
Viel through the testimony of at 
least two of us, we decided gett
ing back to Leitmeritz, to the 
high school for girls where we were
 stationed with the preliminary 
station of the officers™ school, 
when we decided to send a delegation to th
e comma nding officer, and not dema nding, asking for 
an explanation. 
Q: We  have to stop the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Seven 
A: So in the training, you know -- 
Q: Yes? 

A: -- th-the cadet stage of of
ficer training, we had weapons training, specialized weapons, the 
new Sturmg ewehr, which is the assault wea
pons, I™ve me ntioned them to you. And -- but we 
each had to learn how to. We  had training with bazookas because the Soviets had been breaking 

through, the tanks -- we didn™t have me  -- Ger ma n
s didn™t have enough tanks left. And since they 
had broken through the Carpathians the bazookas 
were our last means of defense and the 
bazookas were the long, long pipes, as well as th
e Panzerfausts, we learned that. And we were 
also being taught officers™  strate
gy in military tactics at the lowe
st possible level. That is, we 
were being elevated to recognizi
ng that being a soldie
r is not quite like being an officer. An 
officer has to provide leadership. We ™ve given --
 we were given ideological education, not any 
more Nazi ideology, but repeatedly they emphasi
zed respect for interna
tional law, respect for 
warli -- war making practices, respect for war cr
i -- no, disr espect for war criminality. We were 
told that an officer™s duty is to prevent war cr
iminal act from happening, right, and an officer will 
eventually get ma rried and become  a  noble re
presentative of a new Germany, no mor e  Nazi 
Germany, right? 

Q: This is --  the is the --  this is the late trai ning? 

A: All that in the perio -- yeah, in the 
prem -- between January and end of March 1945. 

Q: ™45, right. 

A: And this they say. And we also had, because 
we were being trained to become  eventually, 
me mbers of the officers™ school for signals offi
cers, we were being given technical education. 

We had to bypass some  very serious techni
cal questions concerni
ng telecommunications, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
112 
 
communications and radio wireless equipment, ri
ght?  And that™s where ma the matics came  in, 
right? 
Q: Right. 

A: So I was able to handle that, right?  Not because of Nazism, it was stri
ctly a profession, right? 
So -- and all that within the context of most of
 us having been happy not to be on the front any 
more, but having higher chances of survival, as 
was indicated by the disl
odging of certain other 
officers™ school to safer and safe
r areas, right?  So we were all 
trying to hang on, I was trying to 
hang on, I didn™t want to fail and be
 sent back, which happened to se
veral of us, right?  In the -- 
Walter Meyhollowicz failed. He coul dn™t handle it a
ny more because I think he was so big he 
would have needed 300 orders of potatoes, he 
was starving. So he failed the exam, wa s sent 

away to the front, the Soviets cap
tured him. He spent 10 years asa prisoner of war in the Soviet 

Union, and some how ma naged surviving, can yo
u imagine that?  Anyw
ay, so -- and then 
suddenly we found ourselves on the second day 
witnessing a plain act of murder. We  got 
together -- sh-sh-sh -- in the evening, and -- 

Q: So it™s -- re -- re-explain that time . 
You™re standing on the side of those -- 
A: I-I™ll -- I™ll 
come  back -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- to -- one mi nute, Joan, let me  just finish this. 

Q: Right. 

A: So, and Barouka Kuno, a fair mi nded soldier, he 
was not a Nazi, he wa s from the tri -- he was 
a Sudetendeutsche. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
113 
 
A: He was one of the three who was sent to pr
esent his petition to the comma nding officer of the 
school, and we™d get the answer tw
o days later. Now, I™ll stop here
, I™ll go back. Okay, so on the 
second day we went back, we were brought by wh
ite truck. A number of prisoners, we didn™t 
count them, I estima te between 1500 to 2,000. At the same  time the ti -- the ditch was supposed 
to be two kilome ters long. Now, two kilome ters
 long is 2,000 me ters. If
 you have 2,000 prisoners 
half starving, how can they possi
bly dig with just to shovel one 
me ters worth of 20 meters across 
and up to two meters deep?  So something -- my numbers may not be correct, or maybe the 

Germans we re thinking that these guys were read
y to work their butts off, hoping to survive. 
Anyway, so we were again posted every 20 me ters
. I was on the right hand side, another guy was 
on the left hand side [indecipherabl
e] both sides, and we had the 
weapons in our hands, and just 
watching them. Now, I was very close to a group 
of seven, and one of the seven -- like, they 
were a bit separate from the ot
hers, and the ditch was ma ybe about a me ter deep, some thing like 
that, but unequally so. And the officer group was 
standing a bit higher up, about 20 me ters away, 
with Viel among them, including the commandi ng o
fficer of the school, and they were kind of 
chatting and looking and chatting and I was stan
ding. I had to look this
 way, not that way, 
because once you™re told where to guard your post you 
couldn™t move even a foot of that. And if 
you had to ma ke a pee you have to ask for permi
ssion to leave or to tu
rn around. And suddenly I 
-- I noticed that big, big guy with a big dark red 
beard, and just urging the 
others on to work, to 
work, to work. And one of the guys was -- the 
first one who got killed wa s a tiny little guy, 
almost no fa ce left, like blue 
eyes, a little sparse hair, no ch
est, barely mo ving, t-tiny, ma ybe 
around 50-ish. And suddenly, I look -- I 
look at that, I hear some thi
ng, there is Viel. Oh, we had 
put our weapons away for lunch, then we got 
our weapons back, but there were still some  
pyramids there because lunches were taken in seque
nce. So Viel goes to a 
pyramid, grabs a rifle, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
114 
 
and there could be more than thr
ee, could be four or five. So one
 of the witnesses said oh, when 
you grab a rifle of the three, the others four 
fall down. He took one of the four or five, stood up 
straight, aimed that and I said 
to myself, what -- wh -- I didn™t
 know the word what the hell is 
happening, excuse me , what™s happening. And I 
said, well ma ybe he™s just limbering up or 
some thing. It was a muddy day for -- you know, sp
ringtime, mud in the river -- gri -- ditch. 
Raises the weapon and aims towards me . I didn™
t even duck because I said, what will -- and 
suddenly, he aims -- it doesn™t take 
long to aim. And so I hear the s
hot and the little guy just falls 
down. Didn™t even just hear the pop, falls down. 
He kind of fell down forward, and the military 
law is, if you hit the chest or the heart, you 
always fall forward, you never fall backwa rd. Okay, 
so second shot, second guy falls down. And then
 a third shot, the big guy. And the big guy had 
stood up straight and he was looki
ng at the officer, and the officer
 was looking at him. The big 
guy had the shovel, the officer ha
d the gun. So the officer pulled th
e trigger, hits the big guy, the 
big guy falls down, stands up, raises his hand. Vi
el aims, shoots the second time, the big guy 
falls down. Stands up -- no more raised arm, st
ands up, still keeps on staring at Viel. Bi g guy. 
Legs like that. He must have been a capo because
 he looked better fed than the othe r guys. Viel, 
third time, plomp. Was in the face, whatever, fall 
down in the mud. Three shots, plus two shots, 
five shots, three dead guys. Foosh. Five shots.
 Ca rbine is not empty yet. Keeps on shooting, all 
the seven guys dead. He mi ssed one shot, right?  
Puts the gun back, the carbine, goes back to the 
[indecipherable]. The officers had looked, tu
rned around, joined the 
group, continued the 
discussion. Seven dead guys. A little while late
r, I™m standing there, I™m looking at the 
[indecipherable] I™m looking at th
e guy behind me, in front of 
me  [indecipherable] the thing. 
What the -- what -- what happened?  What happe
ned?  Deep inside myself I was like a stone. 
Unable to bel -- unable to think. Wh a -- I though
t I™d a -- I had an act
ivemi nd, my mind never 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
115 
 
falls asleep. I just -- pe
trified. I had never seen a dead Jew in
 my life. Suddenly I see seven dead 
Jew -- I never wanted to see a dead Jew. That™s no
t why I was in war. All I was in war, to keep 
the commies off central Europe. Some  of the co
mmies were Jewish commissars. There was, as 
you well know, Hitler™s personal command to kill the 
Jewish commissars, right? Never seen one, 
alive or dead. There were seven Jews . Say not
hing, continue my guard duty. Didn™t di -- don™t 
step off the thing, cause you™re not allowed. But 
-- I hear a noise. A two wheeler. A death cart. 
Typical of concentration camps, I found later 
on. Okay?  Four guys were pushing, prisoners, 
Jewish, death guard -- it s-seemed
 like standard procedure. They
™d appeared from the nowhere, 
they were comi ng closer and closer, nobody touc
hed them, nobody told them anything. Ca me  to 
the ditch --  went to the ditch, put the cart -- I th
ink they even got it some how into the ditch and 
grabbed the little guy who had 
died first, no problem, two guys lift him up, bango on the 
[indecipherable]. Grabbed the sec
ond guy -- they needed all four 
of them to lift up the heavy 
guy. They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so 
finally the [indeciphera
ble] got him and the 
one, two three, all seven, turn
ed the cart around, ma rched away. D
eath cart. Standard instrume nt 
of picking up the dead during the Nazi regime . 
Now, not even the commi e s in the Spanish Civil 
War were doing things like that. 

Q: Were ther e -- 

A: So, we were officer candida
tes. We had been told repeat
edly, abide by international law 
concerni ng warfare, abide by this, abide by that. Th
e rules -- an offi cer™s thing is to prevent 
things like that happening. My 
own leader of inspection did the killing. And it was my own, I 
was part of the officers™ school. 

Q: So he was training you? 

A: Why did he do it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
116 
 
Q: Why?  
A: Was he a German German? Was he a Nazi
 Ge rman?  Had he lost his mind?  Or, my 
[indecipherable] finale -- my late
st conclusion; he had been so
 brainwashed by his own system 
that we [indecipherable] because he had been ma
de officer in the Dachau camp in 1938 -- he had 
been so brainwashed to have believed, like ma ny N
azis, they had become  ma ster of life or death 
of the unterme nsche, and that he was respons
ible to no one. And the tragedy over that is 
evidently the tragedy of seven dead Jewish people,
 innocent as they were, especially, but tragedy 
that nobody brought it to trial. Two days later, 
the officer of commandi
ng school said, what has 
happened, has happened. If you survive the war, if
 you win the war, we are not accountable. If 
you lose the war, you™re going to be dead anyw
ay. So you got away scot-free. And we in our 
deep ourselves, including Barouka, who claime d in 
Ravensburg that he had been in the hospital, 
he had never been there, and the judge accused h
im -- accused him of lying directly into the face 
of modern German de mo cratic law, right?  Even
 Barouka said it was wrong, what had happened. 
Q: Who was  Barouka? 

A: This is no -- Barouka Kuno, one of the witnesses -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- who was quite close to me . He was a decent guy. I was counting on hi m to back me  up. 

Suddenly he looks at me , he says, Lallier, you were
 a traitor. This never happened. So -- so, we 
went through the last four weeks of the war, to
tally, totally having -- I had totally lost belief in 
any trace of huma nity on the part of the Germans.
 So just look at the sequence. Hanging all those 
Serbs. Massacring the pa rtisan women. There 
wa s one more [indecipherable] ma ssacring the 

partisan wome n. Anywa y, I™l
l -- I™ll become -- come to
 they murdered -- k
illing -- oh, t-talking 
about huma n rights and that. And th
at -- oh yes, killing all kinds of
 partisan, burning the villages, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
117 
 
and then seeing this guy killing seven unarmed, ha
lf starved people in thei
r tattered rags, could 
only have meant that the guy had suffered deme ntia
, which is legally excusable, they put a guy 
like that in a nuthouse, right?  Or the ultimate ev
il condition of believi ng that his de stiny was to 
be the ultimate judge over the lif
e or death of people, especially [indecipherable] defenseless 
people. So he, to me  -- Viel was the -- rema ins 
the ultimate example of the evil that the Nazi 
system can inculcate in huma n mi nds, ma king them 
believe at the individu
al level that not only 
Adolf, but they as their emissaries ha d the ri
ght to kill on si ght, without be ing accountable to 
anybody. Now, counter argument, as I learned fro
m the critics at Ravensburg, a Wa ffe n SS 
offi cer will never do a killing like that unless he™s ordered to. 
Q: Who said that? 

A: The defense lawyer. Now, he raised the que
stion that was Viel or
dered by the superior 
offi cers in -- still living in Prague to do the ki
lling to fi nd out how the cadets would react. Would 
they react like true Nazis a
nd clap? Or would those be weed
ed out who ma y have ne gative 
inclinations. Because the SS officer corps will 
need to have undoubtedly component me mbers 
who are ultimate Nazis to whom what Hitler sa ys 
is the absolute right. I 
have no answer to that 
because the commanding officer eventually lost  his lif
e, the last day of the war in Prague, but the 
question was raised at
 the court, you see? 

Q: Well, let me ask you something. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: Either way, whether Viel did 
it on his own, or he did it because  he was ordered, does it really 
ma ke a difference? 

A: Yes. yes. 

Q: Why?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
118 
 
A: Because in all armi es, if the order is
 given, you have no choice but to do it.  
Q: Do you have -- 
A: Including the American Army. 

Q: Do you have a choice if you thin
k it™s a war -- if it™s a war crime? 
A: Please look at Vietnam. 

Q: I don™t wa nt to look at Vietnam -- 

A: I want to look at Vietnam.  

Q: -- I™m looking at this, I™m 
looking at what constitutes -- 

A: I would say that in the German order -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- of military conduct, and war conduct, the order 
has to come from a superior officer, period. 
Q: But you were -- you said you were -- you were -- been trained -- you we re -- 

A: We  were questioning -- 
Q: No, no, no -- 
A: We  were -- I say, there were two choices. 

Q: But what™s a war crime? Tell me  what a w -- 

A: A war crime?  

Q: -- wh-what were you car -- what
 were you trained is a war crime? 

A: War crime is what Viel did to th
ose seven Jews, that™s a war crime. 
Q: Yes. 

A: I can™t give you a purer, clearer -- 

Q: No, I understand that. 

A: -- definition of war crime. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
119 
 
Q: But you were also just bei
ng taught. You were going to cadet school from January -- from 
Mar -- what is it, March 19? 
A: That™s a -- from Jan -- end of January to mi d-March. 

Q: March of 1945. 

A: That war crimes -- an office -- 
an officer™s duty, to prevent -- 
Q: Prevent any war s -- 

A: -- any [i ndecipherable] fr om committing a war crime. 

Q: Right. So isn™t he committing a war crime? 

A: He, in our eyes was co mmitting what
 we would today call a war crime. 
Q: But wouldn™t you have called that -- 

A: At that time  I called it murder. 

Q: Wa -- but still, it™s the same. 

A: Sorry? 
Q: It™s the same, a war crime is a mu rder, isn™t it? 
A: Well, no. 

Q: No?  

A: No. A -- a war crime is a murder in a situa
tion in which a war is properly conducted in the 
Judeo-Christian interpretation, acco
rding to the laws of Judeo-Ch
ristianity, in which you kind of 
go contrary to the laws and do the killing, ev
en though the war crime legal setting would not 
allow you to, or not order you to. 

Q: Well, let me have th -- let me ask s -- to
 you in another way. Did 
you now begin to believe 
that what the Nazis were 
doing, or the Germans were doi
ng under the Nazi regime  was 
committing war crimes wholesale? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
120 
 
A: Well that, yes.  
Q: Is that what you finally believed? 

A: It was a wholesale -- I was goi
ng to conclude that particular
 example, and the hangings in 
Yugoslavia, and that partisan little wo ma n, a
nd the others who were -- oh yeah, the hero, my 
little Serbian hero, were an expression of the endemi c attitude of the German Nazis to kill on 

sight without any fee
lings of accountability. 
Q: And is that what you fina
lly believed [indecipherable] 
A: And -- and that™s what I finally believe and th
at is why I have difficu
lties with the modern 
German system, because at court mo st of them 
doubted my honesty of the testimony. Most of 
them called me a traitor. Now, 
what is that an indi cation of? 
Q: Well, that ™s -- 

A: They™re trying to white -- they we
re trying to whitewash poor Viel. 
Q: Well let me -- okay, let me ask you this. You --
 when you were captured, right, at the end of 
the war. 

A: Yeah. By the Brits. 

Q: By the Brits. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You told an office -- 

A: I -- I prudently arranged 
to be captured by the Brits. 

Q: By the -- I -- oh, really? 

A: Because they were closest to my home . 

Q: I see, right. 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
121 
 
Q: Right. Okay. So you™re captured by th
e Brits, and you tell some  officer -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- British officer, I gather? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What you saw. 

A: Yeah. Not only him. 

Q: Not only him.  

A: Also to the -- to the s -- C.I.C.
 guy Brown, Major Brown [indecipherable] 
Q: Who was  an American. 

A: -- and also to the -- to gene
ral -- two star Ame r ican Genera
l Wood at the UNRRA in Vienna, 
and also to my personal self-appoi
nted confessor, the abbot of the Benedictine monastery, yeah. 
Q: All right, so you -- you 
tell four or five people.
 It™s a number of people. 
A: I told one, two, three, four people, yeah. 
Q: Four people. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. And you™re 20 -- 

A: I was -- the first one that I talked to -- 

Q: 21 years old. 

A: -- I was waiter. The first one, the -- the Br
it was in the summer 1945, I was 20 plus three 
months. 

Q: Right. Okay. 

A: And by that time  I had confirme d my first f
eeling that I experienced
 while I was looking at 
the killing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
122 
 
Q: Which was? 
A: That it wa s wrong. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Now, wr ong means, in the strict se nse of definitions, war crime. 

Q: Right. 

A: Crime against humanity is even better. 

Q: So -- so is that one of the first times th
at -- that a moral clarity came to you during -- 
A: That came at the mo me nt if I we re -- in whic
h I suddenly ma tured into recognizing that all the 
previous moments -- 

Q: Wa s wrong -- were wr ong. 

A: -- were exactly the same. 

Q: Exactly the same, mm-h m.  

A: Endemi c. You know the term endemi c? 
Q: Yes. 
A: I™ve been learni ng En
glish all my life, I -- 
Q: Yes, yes, endemi c is a good word. 

A: -- endemi c to the Nazi Germans. 

Q: Right. When -- 

A: Should I say to the Germans? 

Q: No, I don™t think so. I 
don™t think that™s fair.  
A: Because we now have to have full understanding -- 

Q: Right, I -- 

A: -- that the Germans s uffered under Hitler, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
123 
 
Q: No, no, because -- 
A: They were the ma jor people suffered under Hitler, right? 

Q: No, that™s now why. It™s -- 

A: They hated him.  

Q: No. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: I™m not talking about the Germans who lived at
 the time, but to -- to condemn all Germans 
who lived afterwards -- 

A: Why didn™t the ju -- why didn't the judge in 
Ravensburg lock up the seven or eight who said I 
was lying?  

Q: You can™t just lock up people because they say you™re lying. 

A: Please [indecipherable] mi ne idea is not
 speaking the truth in front of court -- 

Q: No, it™s -- you can™t -- 
A: Okay. 
Q: You can™t do that. So, when did you find out, between 1945 and by the time you leave Europe 

in 1951, when do you find out -- 

A: Yeah, October 1951. 

Q: Right, when do you find out about the gassings? 

A: The gassing? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Why are we suddenly stopping the war crimes ? 

Q: No, no, I™m going to go back to the war cr
imes. First I want to
 know -- I want -- 
A: You will? You promise?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
124 
 
Q: Yes, I promise you. I want to get some  sense of -- 
A: Very -- I was working -- I was working, I di
dn™t know about the gassing until I fina lly got 
hold of the Vienna [indecipherable] in which 19
40 -- when was the Vienna
 [indecipherable]? I 
was in a POW -- no, actually, I found 
out in the pre -- Br
itish POW ca mp, in the course of the 
winter 1945. There was a Jewish 
guy who had worn a British unifo
rm, who went around -- it was 
an officers™ camp, actually. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm.  

A: We nt around in Graz, We tzel
sberg, okay?  And I wa -- have to
 tell you about that too. Very 
close to Tito Yugoslavia and very close to the Brit
s being terribly worried that Tito is -- will o-
occupy that part of Austria and declare them
 Europea -- the Yugoslav sovereign territory 
communist, and the Brits didn™t want
 any of that. So what did they
 do?  They fed us -- ma de us 
do all ki nds of military and non-military exercises, 
even told us -- not me 
specifically, there were 
senior officers that they™d have to keep us phys
ically ready to once agai
n take up fighting against 
the Tito, and brother did we ever 
hate Tito. Giving us the weapons 
to get Tito™s attempts to come  
to the north and push him all the way back. So we
 had a pretty good time learning English at the 
same  ti me . And I say those British officers we
re wise officers, and the one who went around 
asking was a Jewish Austrian who went around wa n
ting to know if any of
 us had been to a 
concentration camp, and if anyone™s 
of -- of -- had ever seen peopl
e, Jewish people being gassed. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now, I don™t know what the others told them, but
 I could only tell him that I myself never did 
see because I was never close enough in the Po
lish area where those things were happening. 
Q: But that was new for you to hear. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
125 
 
A: Yes, that was news to me  to hear and it only 
confirme d -- the term endemi c is very late in my 
life. 
Q: I understand. 

A: But I would now say it only confirme d what I 
was getting the impression then, Nazi Germany 
was about. The absolute right to kill or ga
s, without accou -- w
ithout accountability. 
Q: Right. 

A: And they were a Christian nation, equally Cat
holic and Protestant, which in itself raises ma ny 
other quest ions. They were not all m
itleifer, you know th
e term mitleifer? 
Q: Mm- mm.  

A: In Denazification a key term that excused you
 for having been a major con -- mitleifer is one 
who happily -- 

Q: Run along. 

A: -- runs along. 
Q: Right. 
A: Everything the benefits. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And 90 percent were declar ed mitleifers. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: I was decl ared a juvenile. I didn™t even qualify mitleifer. 

Q: A juvenile, yes -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- cause you were a kid, right? 

A: I -- I have my Denazification document. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
126 
 
Q: But did that -- you know, it™s one thing to see one person committing a war crime. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It™s another to think about a policy th
at become s when mill
ions of people -- 
A: Well, it™s a leap -- it™s a 
leap of -- not leap of faith. 
Q: It™s a leap. 

A: It™s a leap of -- 
of ma l-intent, yeah. 
Q: So quantity and quality ma tter here. 

A: You know, it is a -- both ma tter. I -- I was kind
 of -- could go off completely on that tangent. 
Doesn™t in true human loving. 

Q: Excuse me ?  That -- 

A: In true huma n loving, quality and 
quantity are very closely interlinked. 
Q: Yes, they are interconnected. 

A: Right, and the purer the loving,the closer they™re intertwined ri
ght?  Okay. At any age, right? 
Q: Yeah, yeah, right. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 

A: Okay, so let™s go back to that. The -- it take
s a bit of training in 
philosophy to be able to 
answer the question of individua
l acts of crime, generally I pr efer crimes against humanity. 
Q: Right. 

A: Okay?  Even though Holocaust is a very ex
ceptional kind of crime against humanity, okay?  
Between indi vidual acts of crime 
against humanity and a whole system ge aring individuals to 
that. And there the conclusion is simple
. Reme mber the lady who wrote the book on 
Proletarianism? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
127 
 
Q: Mm-hm. You mean -- 
A: Wasn™t her -- 

Q: -- Hannah Arendt. 

A: -- conclusion -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- that for an individual to act criminally, th
e whole system must be set up on a criminal base. 
Q: Right. 

A: So there is your answer. Viel, you could say, 
couldn™t help it. He had been convinced by his 
superior  that what he was doing was right. But th
at -- wait, wait -- that, in any military strategy 
will then put the blame on -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- the commander in chief -- 

Q: Commander in chief, not
 the -- not the individual. 
A: -- of the United States arme d forces, right? 
Q: Right, right, right. 

A: We ll, that™s not how it works. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because in simpler terms, at any level you™ve
 got to have a direct command from the next 
superior  offi cer, which means to say it never ge
ts to the top. But in the Hitler system, the 
Wannsee conference was the top. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And types like Viel, deranged completely of 
-- not deranged, hateful completely, or not, or 
maybe hurting from a sev -- very severe stomach
 wound that he was still suffering with, ma y 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525

have been said to have lost his mi nd. I looked 
into his eyes, they show
ed absolutely nothing. 
They didn™t show lust to kill. I think that th
e guillotine manipulator s must have had the same 
look of -- 
Q: Of nothing. 

A: -- absolutely no feeling. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It™s not huma n being that we
 are killing, chicken that -- even
 chick -- killing chickens would 
be wa -- awaken some  feelings in you. So, was 
he an executor on his own behalf, or was he only 
executing what the system 
had told him was right?   

Q: Did you have a class -- 

A: Did I accuse the system in Ravensburg? 

Q: Did you? 

A: I did. 
Q: Yes. That was later. 
A: Sorry? 

Q: That was later, ma ny years later.  

A: That was later. At the same time, it had to be said. 

Q: Yes. We ™re going to have to stop the tape. 

A: Yeah. 
End of Tape Seven 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
129 
 
Beginning Ta pe Eight 
A: So was he ordered, or 
did he do it on his own? 
Q: Well, that  we -- 
A: And there is no answer to that. 

Q: -- we ma y never know. We ™ll never know. 

A: No, well see, but again, military di scipline tells you he coul dn™t ha ve done it on hi s own 

because B, he  would also have reduced the effi
ciency of the anti-tank diggers, by reducing their 

numbers. 

Q: Mm-h m. Di -- 

A: And one of the arguments of the de fense was 
exactly that. Lallier is lying, because no officer 
will go cont rary to the need to keep effi ciency as high as possi ble. 

Q: I see. 

A: I found that a very contrived -- 
Q: Wa - Was anyone else s
hocked, in that ditch?   
A: Oh, they were sh -- oh, there were reports
 from the Czech legal pr oceedings following the 
whole catastrophe of the small fortress of Theresie
nstadt in which tens of thousands of people, 
Jewish people mainly, lost thei r lives. 

Q: Now wha t  I ne -- 

A: It is a continuum, a continual -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- killings during the seven or eigh
t days of the diggi
ng of the ditch. 
Q: But, I me an -- 

A: But we were there only for two days -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
130 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- and on the first da
y I heard nothing -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- in my section. 

Q: Right. So you don™t know when a -- 

A: And two kilome ters is long enough not  to be able to hear clearly, right? 

Q: From some body else, right. 

A: And in my section -- this killing ha
ppened in my section on the second day. 
Q: Right. 

A: But court proceedings which to pred -- demons
trate that many people -- I even have a listing 
of the seven dead, plus others who were ki
lled some where else at different times -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- at the same  ditch. 
Q: Right. 
A: Endemi c. So ki-kil -- he -- Vi
el wasn™t the only one, but the Czech cour ts tried several of 
them, and hanged several. 

Q: I see. 

A: In 1948 or 1940 --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- no, 1950 - ™51. 

Q: When you went back 
to this cadet  trai ning -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- the second da -- after that s
econd say when you saw the killing -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
131 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- did you ask about the killing? 

A: No, I went back with -- I went back on th
e following day, requisiti
oning a bicycle from a 
public st and off the main church in Leitmeritz w
ith another cadet offi -- cadet o -- candidate by 

the name  of Schultz, Sep Schultz, a 
real Nazi-like Volksdeutsche, to
 go back and find out if it™s 
really true what happened, right? And we went into
 the kl anifesto, into the small fortress to ask 
some  questions, and we were allowed to go in because we were fully uniformed, right?  So we 

went around and we came across a couple of subalte
rns who looked at us like as equa l because 
we were not yet officers and who showed us, well
 this is the wall against which the shooting is 
done. That is the wall in which [indecipherable]
 and the wall against which some  of the hanging 
is done. This is where some  of the m perished tr
ying to jump across the fence. And we discovered 
that it really was an extermin
ation camp. But we never went to higher command, because given 
our lower -- lower rank, we were just happy to
 have been tolerated 
in there asking a few 
questions. And we decided that -- 
we didn™t just quietly disappear, 
but it strengthened our resolve 
in waiting for the answer by the commander of the 
school, right, to really find out what we got to 
be involved in against our -- our 
perception that officer candidates 
don™t do things like that, are 
not ordered to do things like that. Now, the second question is, why would we have been sent 

there in the fi rst pl ace?  There were other milita
ry uniform -- military units in the area. And I™m 
comi ng back to the main thesis. I think I™m right 
in presuming that the real Nazis in the Wa ffen 

SS command wanted to give a last
 mi nute test to our affiliation
 with Nazism as an ideology. 
They wanted to find out which of us would conti
nue falling into step and 
which of us could be 
considered untrusty and ma ybe put up against 
the wall. And you know what, given the devilnish 
-- devilish -- devilness of
 the system, it™s a plausibl e intellectual question. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
132 
 
Q: Is there -- is there a pr oblem? Wa it one seco
nd. [interruption] So 
you™re asking the quest -- 
A: So the second interesting question is, was it possibly aime d at
 testing the cadets for their 
allegiance to Nazism, se parating those who continue
 believing in Hitler™s absolute ideas about 
the right to kill from those who would have ha
d so me  doubts. And hoping to sort out those who 
would have some  doubts . 
Q: But then wouldn™t you have s
een this happening more generally?  Why just you f -- why just 

you?  It™s only two of you. 

A: I-In -- in a tot -- i-in a totalit
arian system it is very difficult 
to distinguish between generally 
and non-generally. The system in its totality 
exists and under each ma ny interpretations -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- right, will be imposed upon 
people. And it could well be  th
at in the whole Wa ffen SS, 
attempts like that were being ma de throughout 
the war, but I can only talk about our own 
experience, and within our own experience. This
 clash di -- in our d
eepest inside between 
discovering what is wrong, about 
which we could do nothing, and trying to ma ke sense of why it 
happened. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I™m still trying to make sense as to 
why anyone, supposedly an officer, supposedly 
abiding by international agreement and warf
are and on and on and on, not committing crimes 
against humanity, why would a pe
rson li -- do that?  He didn™t
 sound -- look like one who had 
gone crazy. So, a cold blooded killer?  In Nazism 
there was no such thing as a cold blooded 

killer. Viel -- 

Q: Who -- how do you know there we
ren™t a variety of kinds of
 killers under Nazism -- 
A: We ll, I would only -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
133 
 
Q: -- some  cold blooded. 
A: -- I would only -- I would only look at Viel a
nd I would recall during the hangs of the Serbs, 
the presence of Ger man officer
s from the We hrmacht, who were
 standing there and looking at 
the shooters and executioners the way the other 
members of the officers™
 school were standing 
there looking at Viel doing the shooting. Ir
responsive. Would you ca
ll that irresponsive? 
Q: What, if they didn™t do anything. 

A: Showing no -- showing no -- 

Q: No, showing no emotions. 

A: -- emotions, right. Morally -- what the [ind
ecipherable] morally unt
ouchable is the wrong 
term. Lacking any morality -- 

Q: Morality, ma ybe --  

A: -- is the term. 

Q: -- ma ybe. You know, you said, this was off ca
me ra, you said your father taught you fairness, 
but not humaneness. You think that™s tr
ue?  Do you think it took you a lifet -- 
A: My father taught me that humaneness can only live in a system of a discipline committed to 

tradition. 

Q: Nothing else. 

A: Nothing else. He was an 
inveterate traditionalist -- 
Q: Traditionalist, uh-huh. 

A: -- who had failed, even after the wa r to r
ecognize, that even Austro-Hungary, in ma ny 
respects, was not a noble entity. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
134 
 
A: But he needed intellectual refuge in a worl
d -- in most [indecipherable] much worse than 
Austro-Hungary had ever been. Austro-Hungary 
was a haven of righteousness under the eyes of 
that beautiful looking white bear
d and white [indecipherable] Kais
er, right, who la -- loved his 
wife that he had so tragically 
lost. You see, he never saw beyond 
that. Why would he else -- why 
else would he tell me , Adalbert, if you ever 
go to America, you lose you
r civilization. To him 
civilization meant something that  -- 
Q: Some thing else -- 

A: -- had existed before 1980. Would he care for 
the freedom and equality of Serbs on crosses 
[indecipherable]?  No.  

Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: So, it would have -- 

A: He never seemed to care about the blatant di
scrimi nation against the Jewish people, because 
he is a standa rd example to say well, one of my
 friends is a Jewish guy, he teaches ma thematics. 
Q: So it didn™t really get to him?  

A: No. 

Q: What the -- the Nazis had done. 

A: We ll, he was hoping, like ma ny of the others 
in the higher bourgeoisie 
that Hitler could be 
very useful safeguarding the rights of the hi
gher bourgeoisie to exempt higher status -- 
Q: So whatever crimes mi ght have been commi
tted were not -- either they weren't necessarily 
crimes, or they were necessary crimes. 

A: We ll, they -- they would say there are no cr
imes -- there are -- nothi
ng can be regarded a 
crime that is done -- undertaken in order to pres
erve the system that 
you believe is the best. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
135 
 
Q: Mm-hm. Right.  
A: And don™t forget, as a Christian person, he co
uldn™t possibly propose that
 what the pa -- Pope 
said do and done to one and a half million wome n 
burning them at the stake, that that was an 
ultimate evil. And he was a Protestant . 

Q: Right. When you told these people what you had seen -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- these four people. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What did they tell you? 

A: By the Brits, he said -- 

Q: The Brits. 

A: -- he said look, I have a job to do. I reme mber 
it [indecipherable] job to 
do. I have to take care 
of you guys and I have to keep you in good shape.
 He was Scots, I think. I found it very funny 
for guys to be wearing skirts, you know, but I lik
ed them, I liked them. Ga ve me  a chance to 
learn English as fast as possible. And he says
, I have a job to do. Don™
t ask me, don™t bother me, 
don™t bother -- he said, bother, he said [indeciphe
rable]. So I said, but sir, you know -- said, oh, 
no, no, no. [indecipherable] said, okay, I™ll report 
it. Reme mbe r  [indecipherable]. Major Brown, 
C.I.C, Ba mb erg, 1946, October, Nove mber. They send me  ba ck to Bambe r g because I had 

become homeless. I had lost my Austrian citiz
enship because I hadn™t been born in Austria, 
right? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I was -- I served in the German 
army, without, thank God, getting the German 
citizenship. But they sent  me to Bamberg because
 as a so-called Volksd
eutsche, they couldn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
136 
 
send me  back to Yugoslavia. I wouldn™t have gone b
ack to Yugoslavia, right. So I went back to -
- I went up to Bamberg against my will and a year
 later I couldn™t stand it any more, I went down 
to Vienna, crossing the border illegally and th
at was that. Oh, I even
 wrote a letter to the 
Austrian president saying that as a former Au
strian, I beg your pardon, but
 I do wish to live in 
Austria. Coul d you please accommodate me  with 
a permission to cross the boundary illegally? 

And would you believe it, I got a letter from Pres
ident™s of Austria office saying Lallier, you are 
welcome be cause so ma ny of you young ones died,we badly need replaceme nts. Neve r asked 

any questions, right? Anyway, so in Ba mberg I had 
to report to the C.I.C as per my release, I 

have to be entrusted to American or British au
thority for reeducation. Cause they must have 
recognized that I had a brain that mi ght be pot
entially useful for r
eexamination. So that 
[indecipherable] me , you see? 

Q: Right. 

A: So I went to Brown and Brown turned out to
 be a German emigrant. Spoke fluent German, oh 
he spoke such a beautiful Rhineland German, it 
was a pleasure to talk to the guy. And o-over the 
course of time  -- me t him quite a few times -- the Germans gave me  no job because I had been in 

the Wa ffen SS [indecipherable]. Suddenly they said
 well, SS [indecipherable] welcome. I have to 
wait until the [indecipherable] which I got in [i
ndecipherable] not from my father. And -- so 
there was no inside work on that. 
And so eventually we talked about
 the -- America. I took to the 
guy, he was very intelligent. I liked his ways a
nd he was so leisurely. He was so different, not 
[indecipherable] officer German, I -- Major, I said
 wow, Major is staff officer. You know, we are 
[indecipherable]. And he liked me , he said Lalli
er, you are -- in German [speaks German] I can 
reeducate you, do you like America?  I said, I kno
w nothing. I know a bit about the British, but I 
did see Ame r ican soldiers and officers lie on th
eir stomach playing dice. He  says, oh yeah, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
137 
 
love doing that. Would you like to do 
that?  It was a sale, right?  He sa
id then, a little
 while later, 
and would you like to work for us
?  And I said, yes please, I need
 job. I need job badly. So he 
gave me  a job as a stovema n in an American infantry company stationed in Ba mberg. And 
stovema n was the most dangerous job in the army
 because they used gasoline st oves and every 
third of them was expected to 
explode into the stoveme n™s faces
, right? And I said, stoveman? 
Sounds good to me . All the food you can eat, he said. 
So I got the job as a stovema n. I did a very 
good job. Not even one stove exploded while I wa
s working in Ba mberg for nine months. And 
he was pleased, he says, you seem highly useful, 
your English is getting 
better, your German and 
other languages, how about working for us?  I sai
d, doing what?  He says, well, certain things we 
like to find out. You were in the Wa ffen SS for in
stance. What if we sent you to Switzerland to 
explore the escape routes of some
 higher SS offi cials through Switzerland to Latin America. And 

I™m a humbl e  guy, I [indecipherable] thinking of ge
nerals and colonels and all this. I said, why 
should I do that?  He said, because you seem lik
e a guy who can cross boundaries and fact find 
without being caught, and -- would 
you like to do that?  
I said, well, why not?  Where should I go?  
He said, well, go to Switzerland, try to get across 
the border. Make sure th
at they don™t catch you 
because the Swiss will put you in jail for bei
ng Waffen SS [indecipherable] and I™ll gi ve  you 200 
American dollars. And try to fact find in the Ba
sel area if there ma y have been some one on the 
streets, through which some  of these Wa ffen  S -- these SS [indecipherable] he e mphasized 

strongly, seem to have go -- escaped and then to
 Latin America. So, he said, I™ll give you two 
weeks to find out and report back to me . And 
I -- I found it very amusing, here I am a  nobody -- 
oh, and he said, and if you do a good job on the othe
r assignme nts, I™ll try 
to get you a visa to 
emigrate to the United States. Now, I am a livi
ng example of an early sh
ift United States policy 
in 19 -- late 1946, by which time  the Cold Wa r had began. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
138 
 
Q: The what? 
A: The Cold Wa r -- 

Q: Mm-hm, right. 

A: -- had began. I™m looking at some  so-called 
criminal elements in the German ar my, and 
enabling them even to co me to the United Stat es
 on behalf of the mo -- of defending democracy 
for a greater cause which mi ght 
prevail over the presumed war cr
iminal tha -- d-during th -- 
Q: This -- and they al -- they
 allowed -- they allowed -- 
A: -- mi nd [indecipherable] 

Q: -- inveterate Nazis 
to come  in, so -- 

A: -- you see. Oh well, I was -- veterate or not -- 

Q: You were not that, right. 

A: -- I certainly wasn™t venerabl e. 

Q: Right. 
A: Anyway, he was smiling at me  and said, 
would you like to emigrate to United States 
eventually?  I said, well, I have 
no home , I don™t know yet, but I had 
just fallen in love with my 
wife, eventual wife --  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- said no, not yet. And he said, we ll, but I-I w
ill inter -- look at that. Then he said, if you need 
any other type of employment, if things go we
ll I will gi ve you a highest  recommendation as a 

re-educable person. I was 21 years old. 

Q: Right. 

A: Not yet in the prime, okay?  So I went to -- 
across the border, swam a c
ross the river. Boy, that 
Rhine river is terribly cold. Boy, 
is it ever a fast river [indecipher
able] on the other side. We nt to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
139 
 
the next monastery, I won™t tell you where. I prom
ised I would never talk 
about that. And th-that 
why a -- Austrian is a bit like Swi
ss, kind of pretending that I am ki
nd of a  sta -- refugee of some  
sort, I was going around and fact 
finding and I did discover that one
 of the monasteries had been 
quite instrume ntal on be
half of Catholicism -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- not Protestantism -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- to ferret out some  of those people.  

Q: Right. 

A: Most of those facts have since become  
quite well known, includi
ng the persons involved, 
right? 

Q: Right. 

A: And I got my evidence, I went back to, and I 
said to Mr. -- Herr Brown, I said Herr Brown -- I 
didn™t call him Major -- Herr Brown, I have the ev
idence, and he took careful note of that, and 
then I became  serious, and I -- look, I have a pr
oblem. I don™t want to stay here, I want to go 
back home. I can™t go back home, ca use Tito is st
ill there. I wa nt to go back to Austria to study, 
but I need your help, I said. And I also need 
to talk to you about some thing that had happened. 
And this was -- by that time  it was June -- no, Ma
rch 19 -- oh, February 1948. So I had been with 
the [indecipherable] often working in that Am
erican company [indecipherable] company. And by 
the time  he had told me  about the American pres
idency, election for demo -- oh, I loved it, I just 
swallowed America wholesale. And he was delighte
d. And I said, look, I™ve 
to tell you about the 
thing that had happened. In ™48, the Czech Republ
ic was falling to communist hands. Hungary 
had fallen into communi st hands so the threat was 
evidently the thing that we had tried to fight 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
140 
 
against. Soviet Union expanded and become  r
eality. And [indecipherable] look, the Soviets are 
expanding, I™m feeling terrible, I™ve
 lost my home, I don™t want to go to America, what do I do?  
And I said, what do I do especia
lly? I have to confe
ss to you that I had witnessed that murder. 
What murder?  In the Pan
zergraben. Oh, you witnessed a mu rder 
in the Pa nzergraben. I said yes. 
Well, who?  I said -- I gave him the story exactly
, the big body guy, Viel and 
all that. He looks at 
me  and says , I believe you. And I said, you better 
believe me because I don™t believe it was right 
and I™ve got to clear my conscience because I 
believe it was wrong and I believe  the guy should 
be apprehended, and I name d the name . He sits b
ack and says, Lallier. Lally. The Cold Wa r is 
on. I am glad that you are saying that because 
I can -- I™m counting on you. We  need guys like 
you cause you never know about the 
Cold Wa r. And he says, our polic
y is to report these things 
about what the Nazi had done, to higher levels. 
My job here is to ree
ducate you, and talking to 
you to pass on any useful information about you to
 the hi gher ups. I will report what you have 
just said, but there is nothing more that I ca n do about that because I am not a war crime 
discrimi nation -- I am not a war crime investigator
. So what -- I left it 
in his hands. In March 
1948, I crossed the boundary, went to Vienna, f
ound a little job, found my little eventual wife 
and decided that I would appro
ach -- I™d heard from friends a
bout the United Nations refugee 
organization in Vienna. I went there in person 
[indecipherable] I reme mbe r . And I learned that 
the commanding officer was a gene
ral, two star general by the na
me  of Wood. And by that time I 
had handled a British ma jor in the col -- in the 
prisoner of war camp, I™d handled a C.I.C. ma jor, 
and once you have handled a C.I. ma jor, you can 
talk face to face to an American general. 
Q: Right. 
A: Right. So I found mys e lf speaking very fa -- 
low level English, asking 
for an interview with 
the chief of the mi ssion [indecipherable] mi ssion in Vienna, and they almost fell over. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
141 
 
said, please, I speak languages, please, I know
 many refugees, please,
 I know ma ny Jewish 
refugees, please, I want to talk Genera
l Wood. And would you believe it? General Wo od 
received me. There was another proof that the Am
erican system will have even genera ls lying on 
their bellies, playing th
e dice, hoping to win. So with me , play the dice. 
Q: Right. 
A: I went to General Wo od™s office, bowed to h
im, no [indecipherable] any more, right, bow to 

him. Adalbert Lallier, looking 
for a job. He says, what langua
ges?  I said Hungarian. Good. I 
said, Serbo-Croatia. Good. I said, little Czech. 
Oh, he says, ve ry good. We can use you. English, 
he listened to me , he said, you learn fast. I sai
d, also French. He says, 
oh Monsieur De long will 
be your boss. He™ll love you. Right
?  But he said, right now I cannot
 take you because I need to 
find out who you are. So, I said please, please, I 
need job badly. Anything is
 better than cleaning 
stoves. 

Q: Right.  
A: Two days later I pass by, I am invited back 
to General Wo od™s office, he says, I just got a 
clearance from the C.I.C. Ba mberg. A guy by the na
me  of Brown, he says. Not his real name . I 
said, I know. He said I should give you any job. He
 said Lallier can handle any job, you can trust 

him. Right?  So he gave me  a job, two weeks as
 a volunteer without pay 
to clean up all their 
backward records on all immi gran
ts through the Vienna refugee center for the past two years. 
And he said, unless you can do it in two weeks, I 
won™t take you. I can tell you one thing, in my 
life, it was not only the Jewish dime nsion, because
 by that time I had talked to [indecipherable] 
cause I was hanging around waiting for the job, th-t
he ones with the beards, ones with the smile, 
ones who pretended they were -- had been jewele
rs in Budapest, most of them Hungarians, 
because they were escaping en ma sse. And so I 
had heard of the fortunes and mi sfortunes and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
142 
 
decided Lallier, God has sent you, God. Th
ere were times and still are believes -- 
[indecipherable] in which I believe God is, peri
od. Okay?  God wants me  here. So I worked for 
two weeks without sleeping an hour and got hims el
f a filing system from the AA to the ZZ in all 
countries, including the American 
emigration part, not just the Ca
nadian part. Oh, he was so 
impressed, he said, I™ll give you a back pay for tw
o weeks in Austrian shillings. I think he gave 
me  a thousand shillings for two weeks. And he 
says, I appoint you as of imme diately, chief of 
the Canadian desk. And I never asked him, as 
a Canadian should, what business have you as an 
American to appoint me  to the Canadian de
sk?  I was so happy. I had my own second, even 
brought her a picture, I think, Mr
s. -- Madame  Fr iedman, oh, if I had -- hadn™t me t my  wife, 
Madame  Friedman would have been a great subs
titute. Never had anything with her, though, she 
was young ma rried too. Anyway, so I got my secr
etary and in no time I was wielding all my 

languages.  

Q: And you were in the -- 
A: Taking on the refugees. 
Q: -- an-and you -- 

A: And I was that -- 

Q: So you were working in the inte
rnational refugee work commission? 
A: -- I got the job from 19 -- 
I think October 1950, or July 
-- August 1950 to Septem -- to 
October 1951, in charge of the Canada desk, fully
 authorized to intervie
w candidates, report to 
Mr. Delong for a second confirma tion of acceptan
ce and then proceed on my own to bring the 

refugees to Salzburg, being the Ca
nadian desk, to present them to
 the Canadian consul generals, 
and there were two consul general. They were 
a St. Laurent, who happened to be a then nephew 
of Canada™s Prime Minister then, and a 
Mr. Klassen from Toronto. And upon my first 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
143 
 
presentation of my first case, who happened to ha
ve been Jewish, we took a liking to each other, 
because I was well st aged, I had the documentation a
nd I wanted these poor refugees to come  to 
Canada, period. 
Q: I™m going to have to stop you, however. 

A: Why?   

Q: Because -- 

A: Again? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Gee, it goes fast. 

Q: Every -- it goes very fa st. 
End of Tape Eight 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
144 
 
Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: Yes? 
A: General Wood also told me  -- I had my re
port from C.I.C. Ba mberg, from Mr. -- from Mr. 
Brown, concluding -- 

Q: Where is -- where is C.I.C. -- 

A: C.I. -- no, no, General Wood told me , upon gi ving me  the job -- 

Q: I understand that. 

A: -- that he had received
 the report from Mr. Brown. 
Q: Yes, and where is Mr. Brown? 

A: In Bamb erg. He was the C.I.C -- 

Q: Bombeck? 

A: Ba mberg, in Germany. 

Q: Ba mberg. 
A: That is B- a-m- b-e-r-g. 
Q: Ah, okay. Ba mberg. 

A: To whom I had to report for reeducation. 

Q: Right. 

A: And he said under all I am pleased, and I 
know that your statement 
about the killing was 
passed onto higher authorities, leav
e it in our hands. But to you it 
is now to prove that you can do 
the job, because we™re so behind that we desperat
ely need a guy with your languages, but it™s to 

you -- for you to prove that you can do it -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and that you deserve my trust. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
145 
 
Q: Right. 
A: I think that is the first tim
e in my life, in my then life 
that anyone looked at me , ma n or 
fe ma le, ma le or fema le, eyeball to eyeball, be
lieving that I could do 
things right. And you don™t 
know the feeling of liberati
on. Through General Wood, I just absolutely loved America. 
Absolutely loved America -- 

Q: Why?  

A: -- because at that time that I 
first asked myself, why did I have 
to have this terrible episode on 
the side  of the Nazis?  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Cause it ma kes no se nse. 

Q: Right. 

A: Intelligent design. It certainly doesn
™t seem to have been, does it? 
Q: Been very intelligent. 
A: I lost my brother -- I lost my brother -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- don™t forget. I haven™t even me ntioned that ye
t. Anyway, so I worked my head off the first 
presentation went very well. I -- I had an Austri
an identity card, so I had no problem crossing the 
Soviet dema rcation line, which 
was very, very, very tough, and often had to ferry the refugees 

illegally, giving them false iden
tification papers. Most of them
 turned out to be Hungarian 
Jewish. Some je -- Czech Jewish, a very few 
Yugoslav Jewish. I [ind
ecipherable] about 300 of 
them. And often the Jewish people we re, as 
you would expect, jewelers, me rchants, silk 

producers, me rchant general, one banker. None of 
them agr i culture, none of the textile laborers, 
but owners of textile mi lls. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
146 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Canada at that time needed cheap labor. They n
eeded shoe workers, tex
tile workers, so there I 
went -- 

Q: Changing.  

A: -- looking at their docume nts -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and, textile worker, shoe worker, woodwor
ker, ba -- anything you say, I would put in. 

Some  of them looked so brilliantl
y, other than workers, but the c
onsul general were just happy to 
have -- because Canada suddenly was losing, as they
 did United States, th
eir restrictive policies 
as [indecipherable] Jewish people. Unfortunately 
at the same time, and it is not very well known, 
they were also lifting the total rest ri ctions on 
me mbers, for mer me mbers of the German arme d 
forces, including the Wa ffen SS. 

Q: The Canadians were. 
A: Canadians and the Americans. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Into Canada alone, more than 2500 for mer
 Wa ffen SS me mbers of the Ukrainian division 
were transported over by special agreement with 
the Brits, who had captured them and kept in 
Britain, not knowing what to do with them b
ecause the Soviets had shot everybody else upon 
being returned, you see, so with
 special agreement, Jewish people were being let in, but the 
Nazis were also being let in, 
or the presumed Na zis, right?  
Including some  of whom, from the 
real eastern Europe, who had turn
ed out to have been me mbe r s w
ithout saying so, right, of some  
concentration camp and Einsatz commandos, right
?  So I™m looking at th
at parallel, wondering 
about the Canadian approaches between 1947 an
d 1949. Wa s it just to get as ma ny bodies as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
147 
 
possible to replace the lost bodies during the war,
 right? And kind of wanting to be equa l. So 
ma ny Jewis h people, so ma ny non-J e w, I don™t know, 
but the fact is that 
I did tell the Canadian 
consuls upon several visits who I was because 
they had to look at my ba ckground to find me  
trustworthy, right? They knew about
 the incident about the killi
ng and they thought I was okay, I 
was doing a good job and eventually they told me, 
quite soon, Lallier, you too will have to come  
to Canada, we need guys like you. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Your wife is -- you™re ma rried -- you™re alr
eady -- your wi fe is pregnant. So we look at the 
past, we know you have committed nothing wrong. 
Come  on over as soon as you can. And the 
[indecipherable] to Vienna was being abolished 
at the end of 1951, so I decided in October 1951 
to come over here after getting th
e -- I had my big row with my fa
ther about that, right?  He didn't 
want me  to go. So I went anyway. So I came over on the second of October 1951, after having 

falsified or not falsified -- hundreds of doc 
-- immigration documents, and brought personally 
quite a few of them across the Soviet dema rcation 
line, often at the threat
 of being captured by 
the Soviets. But I knew my way around the bridge 
baca -- you know, the Linz bridge  was the key 
thing. You could only ferret people over withou
t proper identification 
during the lunch hour, 
because on the east si de of Linz was a big steel
 factory which the cho -- Soviets ha d reopened 
right? And during the lunch hour, because feeding 
was poor on the east Soviet side, thousands of 
workers crossed the bridge and went to the 
western side where the food was much better, 
American zone. So it is there that I ferre
ted out ma ny, including Mr
. Goldstein and Mr. 
Goldsmith, who had been a very preemi nent jeweler 
in -- in Budapest and 
who eventually got to 
Montreal and opened up the -- the coffee shop, which 
had become  very famous as a little coffee 
shop, on Drummond Street. Anyway, so they wanted
 me  and the Americans, in the meantime, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
148 
 
didn™t let me  loose. The general said, Mr. La
llier, I understand you al
so work under special 
conditions and special cases. I sa
ys, well what do you have to offer?  By that time  I had my baby, 
you see, my daughter. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And he says, well, there is a guy in Czechos
lovakia by the name  of Ruberchinsky. He is a 

chief expert on tensile wires. I had no idea 
what tensile wires were. Now I know. Those are 
wires, stretched wires that use as guidelines
 for precision shooting long distance cannons. The 
Americans has no experts like that. Ruberchinsky 
they -- absolutely they needed to get away 
from these Sovietized Czechs, w
ho wanted absolutely to keep hi
m there for the Soviet Union. He 
says, if you ferret Ruberchinsky t -- out to the west
 and into our safe hands, to the ameri -- 
American zone in Vienna, I guarantee you an immigra
tion visa for the United States as a refugee. 
And boy wa s that ever a challenge. I knew the 
boundary area, I knew some peasants. Peasants 
are good to know. I know that from my boy -- life 
as a child, you see. And I knew -- had some  
contacts on the Czech side  of the boundary. By that time  it had become  communist, you see, this 

was, my God, early 1951, and they needed 
Ruberchinsky and I got
 Ruberchinsky through 
contacts and I arranged Ruberchinsky to be br
ought by lorry and then by oxcart to the boundary 
and then [indecipherable] I crossed the boundary in
to a quick Austrian ready available cab. We  
went to Vienna, I deposited him in the office of
 General Wo od and he almost fell over. And I 
had for -- had phoned the Canadian consulate and said, I have a guy here from the Czech 

Republic -- from Czechoslovakia who is a tensil
e experts, wouldn™t Canada use them?  And they 
said, we want them. So there was a tug of war between -- 

Q: Between the two. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
149 
 
A: -- the American and the -- and the American 
offered him a huge factory, right, already ma de, 
right to take over. And then I 
asked -- so Ruberchinsky got his 
American visa in no time, and 
General Wo od looked at me  and said, you know, La
llier, I know about your
 past, but you really, 
really have done a good job of getting yourself 
reeducated, right?  You know, I™m really happy 
about that. I™m really happy about that. Anyway, 
so Ruberchinsky went to the United States and 
I decide d I would come  to Canada because -- I™
ll be honest about that, some  of the American 
presence had become so militarist ic that I got to be concerned a bit about the message of true 

democracy on the one ha nd, which I lovingly em
braced, and the military regime perpetuating 
itself because  of the feeling of universal power
. And having experienced the German attempt to 

universal military power, I decide d I™d had enough of
 that. No more C.I.C.. I had a couple of 
mi nor jobs, one of them included some body else that
 I had been able to br
ing through the Soviet 
zone in Vienna acro
ss the -- you know Vienna? 

Q: A little. 
A: Th-The Danube -- the Danube canal is 
in the mi ddle of the tho -- town -- 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: -- the nine district, right?  And I had brought 
him to the dema rcation line and the Soviets had 
some how g-gotten hold of that, and the Americans 
were waiting on this side, so I was able with 
the American to pull the co guy, w
ith the last bit of 
our strength across th
e dema rcation line to 
save him from the west and he was almost -- he a
lmost died with fright because the Soviets were 
hanging onto his legs on the other side. So then
 I decided I™d had enough. My wife says, look, I 
want peace and quiet; my daughter ha d been born. So I came  to Canada and -- wanting to study. 

My credentials were good, my E
nglish was much better, my French was okay for Quebec, even 
though Quebec™s accent is different from the French
 [indecipherable]. And I was a Protestant, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
150 
 
in Quebec I found that Protestants were not real
ly welcome, so I kind of deemphasized that. 
There was no immi gration of French Prot
estants into Quebec from 1529 to 1929, can you 
imagine that?  That™s another thing that I didn™
t know about. Anyway, so
 I found meni -- menial 
jobs. I worked in a color dye factory, I worked 
in a -- in the gold mi ne
. I worked as a shoe 
cleaner, I worked in a -- as a vacuum cleaner sa
lesman. And I worked as a car washer. And let™s 
see, I worked one more dirty job, in a barrel
 factory, I was a hole punc
her. Concerned, cause I 
had learned a bit about democracy. I had been to
ld about Jefferson. I had been told about the 
Constitution. I had been told about the duality
 of Canada, and my mi nd was so empty. I had 
known nothing about the systems. That kind of 
pleased my soul. And I was ma rried, I had 
responsibility for the family. My wife was a ha
ute couturiere, she had no problem finding a job. 
So I decided I would work with Steinbergs as 
a store ma nager for awhile to get money and go 
back to school. I went to the French univers
ity for admi ssion, speaking in European French and 
having to answer -- one of the first questions wa
s what religion are you?  
You are from Europe. I 
said well, look, I™m of [i ndeciphe
rable] origin. He  said Protes
tants study at McGill. We cannot 
accept Pr otestants. And that was that. So my desire
 to ma tch my heart with some  of the French 
blood rest  -- rema ining in it, with the French 
heart of Canadian, didn™t work. I went to McGill 
speaking colloquial English. Good for selling v
acuum cleaners, but not good for studying Burke 
and Hume  and Locke. And looked at the guy -- who looked Jewish, you know guys who look 

Jewish, who happen to be Jewish, right?  You see 
it on their eyes. I said 
-- Solean was his name, 
Dean Solean, the first Jewish admi nistrator at McGill in 1954. Okay, big, big difference. There 

had been no Jewish admi nistrators before the
n, so McGill was kind of opening up. I said please, 

Austria born, speaking all kinds of languages, wo
rking for [indecipherable] America, please, I 
want to finish college. What certification do 
you have?  Well, I ha -- in
 Vienna I studied two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
151 
 
years at the university -- and that
™s very impressive. It™s like three years over here. So he looked 
at that, he says, look Lallier, I will accept you for 
a B.A. in economi cs and political science, and 
I™ll put you into honors economics. Oh, I felt so
 pleased. You know what honors economi cs is?  
It™s a special degree, undergra
d, leading you direct into gradua
te school. I phoned my wife and 
said, oh my dear, I haven™t even st
arted, but already I have honors. 
Q: Right. 
A: So I said yes, honors, oh wow. He says, but
 you first must spend another year learning 
English, because if I take you right now you™ll fail,
 and I don™t want you to fail, I see that you 
don™t want to fail. So I ya  -- I said, so whatdo I do?  And there was some thing that I will never 

forget. Dean Solean looks at me , jee -- Jewish Ca
nadian, free to have the first dean job at McGill, 
in a society in which the Jewish people 
were not easily accepted. Tells me, you know, Mr. 
Lallier, Canada™s a great, free country. Do wh
atever you want. But come  back the first of 
September 1954, I™ll take you. And I said, great,free country. Nobody ever in my life had told 
me  it™s a great free country, you™re free to what
 to do. My conversion to
 democracy and huma n 
freedom and individual freedom started bloomi
ng, but deep inside, the shame of what I had 
witnessed ne ver died. So I went to McGill [i ndecipherable] learni ng English day and night, I was 
working 70 words a day, and with that good mi nd of
 mi ne it™s working well, even s-started to 
write in, the [indecipherable] pr
ofessor was very, very, very pr
otective of me  and encouraging. 
And I landed with a very high quality B honors ec
onomics, political science. Wr ote out a few 
letters of reco -- of application. Lo and behold 
Columbia took me  without restrictions, but with 
the restriction to study in the Ru
ssian Institute. Why?  Lallier,
 we know that you know languages, 
we badly need you for your east European languages
 to be trained as a 
specialist in Soviet 
affairs, but you have to learn Russian. And I 
had a Russian teacher at Columbia who was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
152 
 
young lady refugee from Leningrad. I don™t know howshe ma de it, oh she was so beautiful, I 
was studying Russian day and night, including 
some  coffee sessions w
ith the young lady, right, I 
reme mber that. And I felt I was really taki
ng to Russian, everybody was pleased. So I got my 
Master™s degree in economi cs in one y
ear, which was unusual. I had my Russian 
[i ndecipherable] certifi cate in one additional year, which is unusual. And I was fully qualified for 

my Ph.D. in economics. All of that in two years.
 And then I got tired. The United States got the 
war in the Vi etnam. I was suffering under this blatant expr ession of militarism under fa lse 

philosophic and moral premises of 
[indecipherable] theory and all of
 that stuff, and I™d become  a 
person who had highly admi red Jefferson, on the 
one hand, in spite of his dubious background 
lately, right, but also Locke. I™m a [indeciphera
ble] by conviction. And I decided I would come  
back to Cana da, take up a teaching post, fini -- 
post, fish -- finish my doctorate some where along 
the line, but prefer a country of peace. Even 
though the country was suppl
ying all the napalm the 
-- America needed to bomb the hell out of Vietna
m. So I came back home, ca me ac ross some of 
my refugees that I brought 
here, including the guy who had 
opened the coffee shop, who gave 
me  a per ma nent table like in Vienna. Adalbert, 
whenever you come  -- in
 Hungarian -- this is 
your table, I give you my  personal 
services. And he was very grat
eful. And some  others I kept 
contact with, who was very grateful, and I had 
no problem getting my citizenship, even being 
invited to speak at a citize
nship ceremony in both languages 
-- both official languages, no 
Austrian any more, did that. Recognizing the Fr en
ch Canadian identity, but also the need of 
English Canada to rema in strong and united, so th
ey liked that. So that was 1957. I went to the 
United States, lived in New York for th
ree years, 1960 to 1963. Had a very good time on 
Broadway, working part time in a -- in a p -- in a-- in a chicken and sparerib store, a Jewish store 

on Broadway just off Columbia in which the owner told me , when you sell expensive cheeses, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
153 
 
always leave your thumb on the scale. And I told 
him, I can™t do that. He says, if you want the 
job you™d better do that, but also
 got a ska -- part-time ta -- 
I was very good at Columbia, 
actually, had an A average, at the graduate level. 
And the professor that chaired then said lall --  
Lallier, you™re really a very smart kid, he sai
d, even though you™re a bit 
older than the average 
kid, he says, I recommend you for a teaching j
ob at Brooklyn College. So
 he got me  a Brooklyn 
summer job [indecipherable] college, 1962 in the 
summer -- 1961 in the summer. And he said, I 
prefer you to stay in the United States and you don™t need to have your 
doctorate in economi cs 
because with your advanced degrees, graduate de
grees in international politics, I want you to 
work for the Rand Corporation. And the Rand Corporat
ion is the air force™s se
cret service, I wa -
- didn't want that. And I hope, I beg you to unders
tand why I made up my mi nd that I would not 
continue living in the States. I 
love America for its ideals, for 
its honesty, for the greatest of, 
especially Pr esident Roosevelt. Not so much th
e subsequent ones. And fo
r the liberating me , for 
a chance to develop my mi nd. But I prefer mayb
e being a small country me mber, because small 
countries can always prevent themselves from 
ste pping under the toes. Big countries, by their 
size alone, cannot do that. I™m a friend of the Unit
ed States, I am very highly respective of you 
for giving me the honor of having this discus
sion and ma king my confession once again, hoping 
to convince you that when I applie
d that job -- for that job in 
General Wo ods™s office, God had 
given me  a ma ndate, and I™m very serious about th
at, to try to undo, not so 
much my feelings of 
guilt, cause you can™t do feelings
 of unguilt if you cannot prevent th
e ki lling of innocent people, 
but trying to do my best to ease the suffering of 
ma ny of the Jewish refugees, especially those 
from Hunga ry and the Czechia -- and Czechoslovaki
a. And I think I ha ve been able to follow 
through on my ma ndate in doing that, and therebyeasing my pangs of conscience, hoping that 
eventually the ma ker, in the Ch
ristian tradition St . Pe
ter, will look at me  and say, oh Adalbert 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
154 
 
you old rascal, you didn™t do anythi
ng, did you?  But you at least trie
d to redeem yourself and to 
help a people badly needed help [indecipherable] crucial time . It wasn™t thousands of them, it 
was ma ybe just a couple of hundred. And the coupl
e of hundred have had ch
ildren, some  of the m 
I know even eight to 10 childre
n. And it seems that they have forgiven me  for doing nothing, 
even Rabbi Poupko. My conscience 
is still not pleased, because when you have to be a ma n, you 
have to be a ma n, even though it costs your life
. I™ve had mome nt -- in English you have the 
statement, if a ma n is a chicken, he is not  a ma n. At that mo ment I was a chicken.  

Q: What do -- 

A: I™m still --  I™m still ashamed of that. 

Q: What do you think you could have done? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: What could you have done? 

A: I don™t reflect about that, it™s
 a matter of just sentimentali
ty. The Rabbi Poupko tells me , if 
you had decided to talk, you wouldn™t be here witn
ess to a crime, and a criminal would rema in 
unpunished, and ma ybe a  whole system would th
erefore rema in unpunished. So in a certain 
sense, he™d say, Lallier, be practical about th
ing. You ma y ha ve decided not to talk because you 
knew you had a higher purpose than that. You had to
 become  a witness to some thing awful that 
had happened, and that was what your life was a
bout. But even though it 
intellectually sounds -- 
sounds very satisfying, to stand there and to look 
at the ma n killing, right in front of my face, 
seven innocent people one at a tim
e, it™s a horrendous experience. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It ma kes you lose your belief in God -- be
lieve in God, because God would never allow a 
thing like that to happen. And it ma kes you lose
 your belief in basic simp le human dignity. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
155 
 
Q: Is that  -- 
A: Now, the happy thing about that is ma ybe the 
-- not happy, the positive a
bout that is I didn™t 
know those seven people. I know they were Jewi sh. 
But if I had been able to discover who they 
were, in the eyes of some, thei
r names alone would recreate them
 as human beings who had been 
there with a purpose, who had never fulfilled a 
purpose. Because if you sa y -- there™s a big 
difference between seven de -- and not the se
ven dead Jews, and sa
ying Mr. Cour and Mr. 
Steinberg and Mr. Sweinberg and Mr. That or Mr. 
This and That. They are human beings in their 

identities as they were. Their 
lives are recreated. One can even proceed and find out who they 
were, what they had done, what they had achieved for the good or the bad. And if they had had 

relatives or not [indecipherable
] or not. And lo and behold, afte
r the trial, two persons came 
forth, one claimi ng to be the granddaughter of 
the grandfather which she hadn™t known what had 
happened to except that he had died some wh
ere in the -- in the concentration camp. 
Q: How did -- how did you find out what 
the name s of those seven people were? 
A: Oh, through -- through the docum
entary. Oh no, that I found out 
going myself and my -- I was 
sent as a Canadian delegate to the Czech Republic 
as a expert in financia
l -- internatio
nal finance 
to Prague through Casel, which is an arm of
 the Canadian development -- international 
development agencies, to help some  of the C
zech bankers democratize their procedures and 
bring them up to par in terms of capitalistic
 banking practices. I spent six weeks in Prague 
consulting with two very senior bankers, both 
of whom by -- were, by the way, communist party 

me mbers, but who had me llowed down to capitalis
tic practices and wanti
ng to learn about them. 
So I was teaching them how a Canadian banker pr
actices, and I spent si x 
weeks there, and on the 
second week I le -- decided I™d go back to Leit
meritz, I™d go back to 
Theresienstadt for the 
second time  to fact find and to remi nisce. A
nd I went back and I found the site. I found the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
156 
 
ma sses of gr aves and gravestones and all that. A
nd that™s when I decided I would not continue 
living with myself with th
at feeling of sha me unless 
I finally spoke up and -- 
Q: And that™s what ma de  you speak up? 
A: -- ma de my confession. And I came back fr
om Prague in August 1997, and in December, on 
December fi rst, I arranged with Rambam and with
 a friend lawyer of mi ne who happens to be 
Hungarian Jewish, who cord -- who had known me
 for ma ny years and with Rabbi Poupko to 
ma ke my of- official confession about what ha
d happened. And the rest follows all of that. 
Q: I read a report, but I had no idea whether it
™s true, that you spoke to a for mer Wa ffen SS 
person, to ask about -- 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, no, no. I had written -- no, no, that was after that, because once you have 

come  out into the open, there are certain repercussions, but also legal requisites, name ly, I had to 

ma ke up my mi nd, do I sue, or do I not sue. Right? 

Q: No, I don™t -- 
A: Or do I [indecipherable] the Germans to sue. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Right?  But to sue is a procedure going throug
h, at the first stage, the consul general of 
Germany, of the modern, democratic, decent Germany, and go for two or three interviews so 

they can squeeze me , if it™s verac
ity or not, or if I™m lying -- 
Q: No, no, I was a -- I wa s asking -- what I read 
was that you asked a former Wa ffen SS person -
- 

A: No, no -- yeah, th -- but I™ll come  to that -- 

Q: -- permission -- ah. 

A: -- no, no, no, but I™ll -- I-I™ll 
-- I™ll come  to that. Not fo
r permission, mi sinterpretation. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
157 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: But -- but in following through the legal prepar
ation, legal proceedings 
as to how to go about, 
officially I had to find out from the senior, still living, the Wa ffen SS highest commander, what 

his post-war view were, name ly, wh
e n I wrote -- I think it was 1998, okay, about a killing of this 
sort. So on the one hand I wanted to feel him out. 
On the other hand I wanted to play this -- this 
red herring of military hi erarchy and the level of
 responsibility. So I wrote him a personal letter, 
he was General Kumm, he was the second [indeci
pherable] general of my division, but it took 
him away from [indecipherable] and he wasn
™t hanged because of that. The seven other 
commanders were all hanged by the Titoists, and I 
think justifiably so, including a German Field 
Marshall. So I wrote to Ku mm and surprisingly got an answer. I said,I have to account for you 

as the hi ghest remaining Waffen 
SS ranking officer -- he was a brig
adier, at the br igadier level, 
to account for you for the deed by Julius Viel th
en and then, involving seven Jews that they 
killed in the Panzergrab
en. And -- not for permission, okay, I wa
nt you to tell me  if, from what 
you know about military discipline and military command 
structures if this can be looked at as a 

war crime. He wrote me a letter, personal letter
, signing it. I have orig
inal  letter in his own 
handwriting, from a Wa ffen SS brigadier who has 
since died about two years ago at the age of 
92. He says, Dr. Lallier, because I put in my full 
credential to make it [indecipherable], he said, 
Dr. Lallier, I am reporting received of your letter, your
 inquiry, and all that I can say is that in my 
view -- I™m translating now from the  German -- 
in my view, any Wa ffen SS ma n or Waffen SS 
officer who commits a war crime ceases being me
mber of the Wa ffen SS.
 Which means to say, 
he says, that friendship ends amongst  Wa ffen 
SS officers, where war crimes are committed. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
158 
 
A: Now, an interesting statement, because he 
hims elf was commander of 
the division in which 
ma ny what we call today war crimes had been co mmitted. 
Q: Right. 

A: Now, ha d he learned anythi
ng in his long [indecipherable] lif
e in which the Americans never 
touched him, he never wa s in prison, because he 
was Germany™s major s -- expert in partisan 
warfare, which the Americans were trying to l
earn about as much as we can, as we well know, 
right? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Okay?  Now -- or, did he have any other inte
ntions like finding a ch
eap way of apologizing?  
But he in fact told me, you go ahead, because a war crime is a war crime, you have my blessing. 

I didn™t need his blessing. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But I needed him to reveal himself. A
nd you know, given the comm
and structure, once a 
brigadier tells me it™s a war crim
e, the ones below hi m cannot say it™s not a war crime. There is a 
trouble with that. Everybody belo
w him who were at court -- 
Q: Said it was not. 

A: -- told me I was lying. 

Q: Right. Stop the tape.

Q: When you decided to sue this ma n -- 
A: Yeah. [indecipherable] yeah. 

Q: -- right, so Viel coul
d go -- is it Feel, or -- 
A: Viel. 

Q: Viel. 

A: Yeah. The Germans use that V as a ff -- 

Q: As a ff. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is that the first time your fa mily found out
 about that you had been
 in these kinds of 
situations? 

A: Ah, I had -- well, my -- I had really no fa mily. My fa mily was my wife  -- 

Q: Right. And your two children. 
A: And my fi -- my wife
 had already di -- died. 
Q: Oh. 
A: She died in 1975 with a brain tumor. 

Q: And had you said anything to her about -- 

A: I never discussed my wife -- with my wife my military -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- experiences. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
160 
 
A: Because our love was a pure love and I -- I don™
t want to -- she knew that I had been in the 
Prinz Eugen, but she also knew herself, being ha
lf Volksdeutsche that  conditions was that -- th-
those of ca -- total, total 
oppression and total one handedness 
on the part of the Germa ns. 
Q: And was she Hungarian? 

A: She was happy, she loved me  for being able to get away with my life . 

Q: Right. 

A: And you know, she is also -- I reme mber -- you 
reme mbe r  I told you I was try -- I was raised 
in a cir -- circumstances of giving true ladyshi
p ultimate consideration as a person, as a civilian, 
as a civil gentlema n, right? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I™ve been able to convince 
her she -- that she was the greates
t lady in my life. And I think 
really very happily with that concept. In 
return, she gave me  love and the children. 
Q: And sh -- you had tw
o children with her. 
A: You see [indecipherable] but my 
children are ya -- my children know. 
Q: Right. But they fa -- 

A: My son I told, but he is 
10 years younger than my daughter. 
Q: I see. 

A: But my daughter I didn™t tell about because 
she had had some  upheavals in her life, I didn't 
want to burden her with that. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But after I came out with the confession, she 
came and said, Dad, you were absolutely right, I 
am completely on your side. 

Q: Yes. Wh y do you call it a confession, do you think? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
161 
 
A: Because, as a Christian -- 
Q: Since it isn™t your act. 

A: -- as a Christian, to feel in
 a situation which you desperatel
y need to talk to some body who 
will listen to you with feeling and with antici
pation of being able to do some thing for you, you 
empty your soul. You empty your soul to get rid 
of the feeling of the sin that you had committed. 
And it is only upon m- matching the mi nds, he, the 
confessor, believe that you are honest. You, 
the confessee are giving an honest
 infor mation. There™s a higher 
level of togetherness in which 
the forgiveness is given by the authority who is ra
ised in the culture, then
 educated to understand 
and to give you forgiveness. I™m not a Catholic, 
I wouldn't believe in having to go to church to 
confess my l ittle [indecipherable] that and the 
priest would tell me  
-- tell me all about it. 
Q: Right. 

A: You see, I™m not that, but I did go to [i
ndecipherable] who was -- who was a Pryor of the 
Benedictines, which had been my sc hool and ho-hoping for understanding, 
but his answer was -- 
and when I told him about the crime, he says, 
Adalbert, you have got to build your postwar life. 
What has happened had happened, he
 says, you cannot change that, it™s in God™s hands. Now this 
is not an answer that I would c
onsider satisfactory, right? But at 
the same time the urge to go to 
some body who is a potentate, I us
e the term potentate. What is
 a potentate? Kind of some body 
assigned by God to fill in the particul ar command position where human needs are looked at and 

decided positively creative. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I wanted to empty my  soul for some body to 
s a y, Lallier, we recogni
ze your agony. We  cannot 
forgive you, we are not God, but we™ll pass on the me ssage that on the whole you have tried to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
162 
 
be -- to be -- to become  and rema in a good guy. 
Confession. I want to die, I™m 83 years old 
almost, with some body c o mi ng to my  coffin and say, at least you gave me  that job. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Simple as that. And I-I -- I have living 
witnesse s [indecipherable] the ki ds, Evan and 
Frederick, I™m trying to keep the candles lit. The 
Jewish people are specia
l people. They suffered 
a great deal at the hands of the 
Catholics, it wasn™t right, all of
 it under the false premises that 
Jesus had been killed. I asked myself often that, 
did Jesus deserve being de
clared a God? I prefer 
the Jewish version, he wa s one of the prophets whose image as some body, changed unto a 

godlike ima ge, for whatever extra powers that mi ght
 involve or imply. So that™s not in the right 
way, I don™t even know if Jesus would have wanted 
to be declared a God. So I™m much closer to 
the Jewish interpretation of God, it™s the one th
ing that I have problem
s with, the notion the 
Jewish God is kind of desperatel
y absolutist. Like we can bargai
n for everything, but God is the 
absolute command, we™ d never even dare contempl
ate to ma ke a counter-p
roposal. God to me  is 
some body I can talk to, God is some body will -- 
who will understand be cause God by nature is 
good. God is not a comma nd person. God is a guide. And God created Eve and Adam, I don™t 

know in which sequence, was it a 
guide who would eventually -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- knowingly put thei
r hands together?   
Q: I don™t know. There are two stories. 

A: He ma y have been jealous of Adam, you see. 

Q: You know, when you talk about confession, it 
-- it™s -- it™s interes
ting to me  because you 
didn™t -- I don™t know whether you™v
e f -- th -- whether your -- I 
don™t know exactly what your 
guilt feelings are, ma ybe you don™t either. In 
some ways you feel guilty because you feel you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
163 
 
were a coward, you didn™t do some thing. But you
 also didn™t do some thing against some body. I 
mean, you didn't kill -- you didn™t ki ll these Jews. 
But it also feels as if your feeling of guilt 
spans larger than that one incide nt -- 
A: Oh, no -- 

Q: -- that ™s it™s m -- that it™s -- 

A: -- no, th-th-th-th - it -- clearly, 
the one incident is the sample, 
which demonstrates to you that 
the incident itself took place in a cont
ext in which the broader reality -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- reconfirme d the eviln
ess of that reality.  
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: It™s the one particular exam
ple of an evil empi re that I wa
s part of. I don™t know why, but I 
was part of that. And the -- the feeling of guilt was, in a certain sense, arose fr om the feeling of 

impotence -- after impo --- feeling 
la -- impo -- I™d so desperately 
want to do something, but I™m 
unable to do anything because I™m totally petrifie
d in my state. Now, wha t  do you do with that?  
You just swallow hard, just swallow hard and 
by swallowing hard you get to believe that if you 
had done some thing, they ma y not have gotte
n killed. And Rabbi Poupko, I told you Rabbi 
Poupko exactly, Rabbi said Lallier, that doesn™t 
follow, if you had done some thing they ma y not 
have killed. Because if you had done some thing a
bout the first one getting killed, they™d kil -- 
they™d have  killed you and the 
other six anyway. But I cannot accep
t that because again, th-th- the 
harder view, a ma n being a ma n, in a context of 
a civil society in which killing is murder. And 
racially induced killing is the 
ultimate crime, let™s say. Extermination of a whole people. What 
does a ma n do with that?  Do I grab the gun?  I 
didn™t grab the gun. And I watched the other six. 
So, by doing nothing, Viel was able to do whatever he had wanted to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
164 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And that™s where the pain is. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: That™s where the pain is. And that
™s where the confession come s from. 
Q: Right. Are you angry at people at
 Concordance College for not -- 
A: Oh, Conc ordia, well -- 

Q: From Con-Concordia, I™m sorry. 

A: I™ve become -- you™re looking at me, I™ve trie
d to be a ma n of peace, using a Locke high 
discourse. 

Q: Whose discourse? 

A: Locke. 

Q: Locke™s discourse? 

A: Locke high discourse. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And his proposition that even 
in most difficult circumstances, 
negotiation is far preferred to 
shedding the red blood of the opponent. I believe th
at since we  all are red blooded, we have no 
reason to say she is Jewish, she is Muslim, she is 
Christian, she is this, sh
e is that, cause we are 
all red blooded people, which ma y be where th
e problem is, right?  And 
I™ve convinced myself 
being red blooded means eventually
 we™ll recognize that
 shedding our red blood reciprocally is 
ma king no s e nse whatsoever.  

Q: But when I -- 

A: It™s the same  blood. I shed your blood, I™m 
also shedding my blood at the same  time. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
165 
 
A: So negotiation is muc h better, but negotiati
on means trust and confidence and the time  to 
achieve, hopefully, a positive end. You see?  See [i
ndecipherable] I™m a realist, I will di e having 
my positive belief that  the recognition -- that  we all 
have the same -- we all shar e in the same red 
blood, will put an end to the killing because it [i
ndecipherable] recognize si nce is our bl ood as 
well as yours, shedding it is not just sinful, it 
ma kes absolutely no sense, solves no problems. 
Q: Right. But what I mean is is there seem 
to be some  people at Concordia who don™t -- who 
don™t believe -- 

A: We ll, there are five guys -- five guys, w
ho including MacIntosh for some  reason didn™t like 
me , I don™t know. You can™t like ev
erybody all the time, some  dislike me , some  [i ndecipherable]. 
He wanted to be the authority of the departme nt, he 
used four junior professo
rs to sign that letter 

with him that I was a war criminal, and that 
my confession was only the tip of the iceberg. 
Totally complete nonsense, right?  At the same  ti
me , he acted hatefully without ever talking to 
me  about fa ct. He only went by what he read in
 the paper, and he had been a [indecipherable] 
colleague of mi ne with whom I™d coop -- c
ooperated on ma ny occasions, so I don™t understand. 
Maybe -- he ma y be a Scots Canadian, one of his 
-- whose relatives ma y have died at the hand of 
a Nazi during the war, I don™t know
, I didn™t inquire. But -- but to
 proceed from that with a 
general accusation, which by the way the university ha
s strongly apologized for in writing in the 
newspapers, right? There is a big difference, I th
ink. He is an uncompromi ser. I would have -- I 
would have been happy to talk to him and gi
ve him my personal rendition, including the 
rendition of my suffering, hoping that he woul
d say, well Lallier, you we
re caught in a bind. I 
don™t know what I would have done if I hadbeen you, but I-I don™t know, but I can see you -- 

that you weren™t a contributing cause to that kill
ing. But what [indecipherable] me  spe c ifically, 

his being the chair of the promotions departme nt, 
he used his power of the chair to induce four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
166 
 
young professor who needed his recommendation to
 get a promotion and tenure, which they 
thought they would only get if
 they cosigned the letter. 
Q: Right. 
A: And that™s where human unfairness to the highest degree come s to pl
ay, and in my view 
academics don™t behave like that. At th
e same time, look at the academics. 
Q: Right. 

A: Look at the guy who told you -- reme mber what
 I told you some little while ago?  But -- I am 

God, all you need to do is know what I tell you. 

Q: Right. 

A: So he was a hateful person [indecipherable]. He
 just happens to be a hateful person. In my 
[indecipherable] I say St. Peter will ma ke hi m burn. 

Q: Do you feel less guilty? 

A: I feel -- I feel, let™s say, 
about Concordia, I was pulled out 
from my te aching at a very bad 
time in my life. It was a time in which I had re
ally convinced myself that I had become  as a 
teacher a -- an incessant contri
butor to convincing students that 
developing their own ability to 
reason was the only way to go. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And you develop your reason, but always inculcat
ing them with this ne ed to ask question, to 
confirm fact. And to become  critic
s of whatever fact [indecipherab
le] repr esent, name ly, to think 
for themselves. In my whole life since I was re
leased from the British P.O.W. ca mp, was an 
attempt to catch up with those four years that 
I had lost comp letely, right? And develop a mi nd 
that I could use on benefit -- for the benefit 
of the development of 
mi nd of young ones equally 
capable of giving a sharp eye, and if necessary a 
critical look at ings -- 
what things is, in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
167 
 
honest desi re to find solutions along the peacef
ul planes of finding solution. I think ultimate 
intellect ualism, not ism as a [i ndecipherable] ul-ultimate levels of intellectual reasoning are the 
only way to bring about world peace. Because i-
in the mi nd that one recognizes that which 
brings up possible, and that it 
is possible to achieve all kinds 
of ends without shedding huma n 
blood. 

Q: Right. 

A: And Jewish people with this dispro -- not
 disproportionate, rema rkably high proportion of 
philosophers and [indecipherable] not just Ei nste
in, but a whole bunch of other, including the 
atom bomb makers, the-they -- they have an 
exceptional gift. I don™t know how ma ny of the 
refugees that I was able to bring over here, whatev
er the pretext, have ha
d children like that, but 
I™m happy that quite a few of the m 
had eight or nine to 10 children. 

Q: Well, I want to thank you very 
mu ch for being willing to talk -- 
A: Great, great talk. 
Q: -- to talk with me. 
A: But please don™t forget, for th
ree years I served the evil em
pire. And part of that was a 
conviction naturally, an honest convic
tion that serving that empire w
ould put a halt to what I still 
believe is an empire equally as equal -- e
qually equal -- equally as
 evil, name ly godless 
Bolsheviks. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I don™t know what my contribution any worth. 
I™ll have to watch my students and see what 
becomes of t hem. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0525  
168 
 
A: And I admi  -- my -- the gratitude is on my pa
rt because for a lady like you I must say that, 
respectfully speaking, to fly 
all the way from Wa shington to
 Montreal, even though weather 
conditions are [indecipherable] as you had anticipate
d, right, it -- it -- it -- 
it is very impressive 
and it also honors me  be yond what I deserve. 
Q: I thank you for that -- 

A: Really, I real
ly, really -- 
Q: -- thank you very mu ch. 

A: -- I admi re you -- 

Q: Thank you very much. 

A: -- for ma ny, ma ny respects, and esp
ecially our contact [indecipherable] 
Q: Wait a -- you don™t want to -- 
you don™t want to get up yet. 
A: Okay -- well, I do -- I had to stand up. 

Q: I™m sorry. No, no, it™s fine. 
A: It™s a sign of respect. 
Q: It™s fine. 

A: If I were asking to dance, 
I™d have to stand up and bow. 
Q: You™d have to stand up, 
right. We ll, thank you again. 

A: Thank you very much for asking. 

Q: Okay, now what we™re going to do, is we™re
 going to look at the photo -- [tape break] 
Q: So just tell us who that
 picture is right there. 
A: Okay, these two are my mo m, H
ungarian, and my dad, Austro-Hungarian. 
Q: And this was -- can you just sa
y what day it was. It was the -- 
A: When they got ma rried. This was about 1924 -- oh no, 19 -- sorry, 1921.

Q: Okay. 
A: Yeah. Cause my -- my brother wa

Q: So this is your mother, Dr. Lallier? 

A: Say again?   

Q: Just a -- 

A: These are the photos of 
my mom and my dad, 1921.  
Q: Okay, perfect.  

A: This was Omar at the age of 84. 

Q: And who  is Omar?  

A: 84. My father™s mother. It™s my father

Q: Would you say this is my grandmother? 

A: Again? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: This is my grandmother, my father™s mother at the age of 84. 
Q: Who™s that? 

A: This is my grandmother and my brother and 
myself in 1933, three year
s after my mom died.  
Q: Is this the dog? 

A: Oh, oh, the dog. And Tookie. 

Q: So -- so it™s your grandmother on the left -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: It™s your brother ne

A: Yeah. 

Q: And it™s yourself on the right, right?

A: That™s right. 
Q: Perfect, okay. How old -- how old are you there? 

A: I was -- here, I was eight years ol

Q: So tell me  who these people are. 

A: Okay, my gr -- my grandmother a

On the right I™m a graduate at 
the age of 17 of high school, in Hungarian parade uniform.  

Q: Okay, and who is this [indecipherable] 
A: It™s the Hungarian lady who brought us 
up. Her name  was Anna Fayis. Anna Fayis. 
Q: And wha t  -- what year is that? 
A: Hungarian lady -- oh, what year
?  This must have been around 1938. 
Q: Left to right, who is that? 

A: Yeah, myself, 1940, with two ladi es, young ladies
