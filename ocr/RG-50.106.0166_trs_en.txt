 This is tape number one, side
 A. 
Could you give me your full 
name please? 
Answer: My name is 
Renate Rosemarie Fischer Chernoff. 
Q: And where were your born
 and when were you born? 
A: I was born on June 25
th
, 1929, in 
Breslau, Germany
. Germ -- 
Breslau
 is now 
Polish, but it was German 
at that point in time. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit about your family
 background. How far back did your family 
go in 
Breslau
? 
A: My family actually went very far back
, I would say. I have records to -- o-of 
graves having been erected in -- just
 right after the Napoleonic war, the 
Franco-
Prussian
 War. And of all strange things, one of
 the graves that may  have survived 
all the fighting in that area is
 still standing today. I manage
d to get a picture of it just 
very recently on the web. And we were 
very excited to see that gravestone. 
Q: What -- what was your father™s name? 

A: My father was 
Walter James Fischer. 
He was a psychiatrist. He went to school 
in his native town of 
Breslau
 where most of my forebears were born. He was -- is

the professional person in his fami ly. Hi
s parents were merchants, they had a 
wonderful -- probably the la
rgest toyshop in all of 
Silesia,
 and he chose not to go 
into that kind of wo rk, perhaps because he 
was in the army in -- in the first W o rld 
War, and fought in 
France
, fought in 
Verdun
, came back and -- and at that point he 
was only 16 or 18 years old. 
And came back totally paraly
zed by wh at he had seen; 
he was a litter bearer in the field, and deci
ded that medicine woul
d be his calling. S -
- my  grandmother and grandfather had 
the shop, both of them worked. My 
grandmother worked  alongside her husband 
and so  did her sister and his brother. 
They  were two brothers married to two si
ster s, and so it was definitely a famil y  
affair. And their parents, my gr
eat-grandparents were also in 
Breslau
. What they did 
I™m really not sure, but in 
-- in business of some sort. 
The busin ess, interestingly 
enough -- the house where the business was 
housed is standing today in the very 
same place, it was one of the few build ings 
that survived the s
econd World War. It 
was on th e rink, the main square of the city of 
Breslau
, right opposite the court 
build ings. It™s number 26 on -- numb er 36, 
ex cuse me, on th e rink. And I have seen 
reproductions of that area, 
or photographs of that area 
and sure enough, it™s still 
there. The Poles have really taken a great deal
 of trouble to try to rebuild that area as 
it was, and I think s -- handled it very successfully. My forbearers
 on my mother™s 
side were from 
Birnbaum
, which is really on the 
Polish side. What -- my

grandfather on my  mo th er™s side was in 
the canning business, and was the first 
canner wh o did diab etic fruits in 
Germany
, canned diab etic fruits. And had the 
factory just outside of 
Breslau
 and so my mother grew up
 really in the country, in 
this -- it™s suburb an now, bu
t it was really country wh en  she grew up, and that she 
loved. And she did go to  school in 
Breslau
, but the rest of the time she was a 
country girl. 

Q: And was she a housewife? 
A: Actually, she was, alth
ough she went to high schoo
l and upon graduating from 
high school went to a sort of a finishing 
school for girls and studied mu sic. She had a 
magnificent voice, and was very nicely trai
ned, and sang eventually professionally, 
in part, but always sang fo
r the high holidays at synago
gue. And in fact, I came 
across a letter just the other day, the head of the synagogue in 
Ratibor
, which was 
one of the places where we 
lived, thanked her for making 
the service so beautiful. 
Q: In talking about the syna
gogue, can you tell a little b
it about how religious your 
family was? 
A: My grandparents on both sides were fair
ly religious. My fath
er was pretty much 
of a free thinker. My mother was more relig
ious than  he, but I think both of them 
became very, very much more 
religious when we crossed ov
er to this side of the 
ocean.

Q: Mm-hm. Did you, as a small child
, reme mber celebrating any holidays? 
A: Oh yes, we always celebrated holid
ays and I particularly reme mber Sukkot
 
in the 
synagogue in 
Ra tibo r, 
which is the little town that I real
ly rememb er best of all. It 
was in the -- in 
Upper Silesia
, which was a numb er of hours by train from 
Breslau
 
going towards the Czech border 
and the Polish border, we we
re sort of in a -- very 
close, within walking distance of the Po
lish border, because I remember walking 
with my mother to have 
buttermilk on the Po lish side of the border because the 
farmer -- that farmer™s butte
rmilk was by all means the very
 best, and so  we walked 
across wheat fields an d over the border to
 get our buttermilk. Very nice memo ry.  
Q: So did you celebrate Shab
bat, did you go to synagogue? 
A: We celebrated Shabbat, my mother ki
ndled candles. We celebrated Passover, but 
mostly we celebrated our Passovers, and I ha
ve very vivid memo ries with very dear 
friends who were Orth odox, I believe. And 
we s -- I went to services on Saturday 
mo rnings, not with my  parent
s, but with a friend of thei
rs who to ok me not only to 
synagogue on Saturd ay mo rnings, but took me out for a 
krimmelhelmchen
 which 
was a poppy seed roll o-on our way home. And th at made a great impression on me. 
But my grandpar -- my grandmother -- I thi
nk all of them were really liberal Jew s 
rather than Orthodox Jews. 
I think tha-that it was not 
named Conservative, I think

that branch of Jewry in 
Germany
 was called the liberal branch and we went to 
synagogue there rather than
 the Orthodox synagogue.  
Q: Were your parents very politically active? 
A: They had very  strong opinions. Active,
 I wouldn™t say, no. Ma -- I think my  
father™s days were so full with his -- with 
his work, and with work
 for the courts. He 
was very often asked to be the s -- the psychi
atrist who gave opinions in court cases. 
And they were very activ
e at their lodge, the 
B™nai Brith 
lodge. That I do 
remember.  

Q: Let™s just get a sense of a structure he
re with how lo ng you lived where. Y-You 
said you were born in  
Breslau
, and how long did you live there? 
A: All right. We were born -- I was born in 
Breslau
. When my father w -- a-already 
was working in a suburban area -- area called 
Obernigk. O-b-e-r-n-i-g-k
, I think. It 
was a suburb of 
Breslau
 and had a large psychiatric hos
pital in it. A nd there he had 
his job and there we lived. Now, I was very
 little and really have no memories other 
than picture memories of that place. It wa
s the same town th at my  grandparents had 
the canning factory in, so this all work ed out
 very nicely in that respect. We mo ved, 
I believe it was 1934 to 
Ra tibo r
, 
R-a-t-i-b-o-r
, it is now also in Polish hands and 
has changed its name just a little. And I th
ink when we moved we
 -- I was i -- going 
into nursery kinderg arten, and I went to the school of the 
Ursuline 
sister s and I

loved my time there. T h ey were so good 
to us, and they -- I learned so many little 
skills, and I even still have the little needle
 book that I embroidered for my mother, 
my first timid effort at work
ing with fibers, and it was very precious to my mother, 
and a little moth-eaten but I still have it. A
nd we moved into our 
first house and we 
rented an apartment on 
Sv ingerstrasser 
17 and within a mont
h or two we were 
asked to leave because we were unwanted
. The owner of the house didn™t realize 
that somebody with  the name of 
Fischer 
could be Jewish. An
d so we moved and 
found a very nice apartment on number 23 
Svingerstrasser
, and I have very vivid 
memo ries of it, I could draw the plan of th
e apartment. It was a first floor walk-up, 
very large apartment and my father was 
able to have his pr
actice right in our 
apartment. The first room was very large, 
with -- I can™t think of the English word 
for the moment. It™s a-a-an 
[indecipherable]
 a a no -- a no -- a knockout, a glass 
knockout so that one could really watch 
the street up and down and see what™s going 
on and it was an up -- first floor, upstairs, a
nd large. And then th e room next to us 
was the waiting room. And during the day 
it was the waiting room for the patients 
and in th e evening it was the gentlemen™s room
 to have cigarettes. And as we walked 
down the corridor, there was a ki
tchen to the left in which 
Ma ria
, our very dear 
domestic help who lived with 
us, did her thing. And th en
 further down, of course, 
was the dining room and th e living room 
and my  bedroom and my  parent™s room.

Q: So you were 
an only child? 
A: I -- yes, yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: My mother always said Mr. 
Hitler
 saw to it that I was an 
only child. They  would 
-- they were ready to have a rather lar 
-- and had hoped for a rather large family. 
However, I did acquire a brother a little 
later on,but that™s
 another story. 
Q: Were either of your parents artistic? 

A: My mo th er sang very beautifully and my
 father always thought that he might 
have, if he had not become 
a physician he mi ght have 
become an architect. So I 
think yes, I would say so . They both had ex
tremely fine taste in things that they 
chose to buy, and yeah, I would s -- and my
 mo ther™s singing, of course, was quite -- 
quite remarkable. 

Q: What languages did you speak at home? 

A: German only. My mother
 knew some French and my  father studied Greek and 
Latin in school, and -- but of course it wa
s the reading language
 of Greek and Latin, 
I don™t know that he spoke it,
 other than memorized poetry. 
Q: Was it a mixed neighborhood -- we™re now talking about 
Ra tibo r
 because you 
said you didn™t really remember b efore that, is that correct? 

A: That™s right, yeah.

Q: Yeah, so can you -- was it a mixed 
neig hborhood of Je
ws and non-Jews? 
A: Yes, it was definitely a mixed -- a 
mixed neighborhood. I don™t think that 
Ratibor
 had a specifically Jewish area, I think 
we were all very well here and there. 
I-I cannot th ink of -- of a Jewish neighbor
hood, per se. The ne
ighborhood where we 
lived was -- was a nicely treed neighborhood
. It was a main street, and yet it had 
trees on it and in the back of our house 
was a -- every apartment had its own little 
garden, and so we raised strawberries. 
It was a small garden, but we raised 
strawberries and flowers and there was a litt
le house on the gard
en, in the back of 
the garden , big enough to have a table and 
maybe six or eight chairs and I know my  
mother™s book club met there 
in the summertime. And of course, I loved play ing in 
the garden . And I had a nanny who made sure
 that I learned how to  grow things and 
to weed, and to take care of flowers and 
who was really my  steady comp anion after I 
came home from school each day. 
Q: So did you play with an
y of the other chil-children in
 the neighborhood or just 
with your nanny after school? 

A: You know, it was easy, it was -- well,
 not -- perhaps not 
the children in my 
neighborhood because across from 
our house were the courts, the courts of that part 
of the province. So th ere were not that many houses that had ch ildren in them. 
Q: You™re talking ab out judicial courts, not --

A: Judicial courts. 
Q: -- not courtyards. 

A: No, no, no, no, judicial 
courts. But one usually made
 appointments with one™s 
friends and after school they 
could come to my  house a
nd it was always -- I always 
had a lot of little friends who came over 
and whose company I enjoyed and whose 
homes I went to as well. Not 
for very long, 
but for awhile. 
Q: Right. Were these Jewish
 and non-Jewish children? 
A: We had -- I had very  close Jewish 
and non-Jewish friends, and I was very 

fortunate enough to have the non-Jewish frie
nds because some of them were really 
lovely ch ildren with  whom I enjoyed being 
together. And we were
 together really, 
until the time when it was no long
er allowed that these little 
girls, particularly, could 
come and visit me. My very dearest fri
end was a young girl by the name of 
Ushi 
Blaut
, whose father was an archit
ect for the city, and who wa
s threatened to lose his 
job if his little girl came and played with
 me. And I think maybe that was the first 
awakening that things were very strange. 
Q: That was your first awakening. 

A: My first awakening. 
Q: And -- and what was -- do you reme mb er 
-- granted, you were very young, but do 
you remember any th oughts you had at th
at time, or what that meant to you?

A: It meant a great deal to me because we
 saw very mu ch  eye to eye and we loved 
being naughty together. I couldn™t understa
nd why. I couldn™t -- I could see her at 
school, but yet she couldn™t come to my  h
ouse after school, and I couldn™t visit her 
any more. And that -- that started -- I mean
, that kind of began and then it was like 
something rolling on and on and on and it 
-- and it was -- I tell you, the one thing 
that I do remember is by goin
g through some old photographs, I did find out that she 
was allowed to come to my  birthday party an
d I think that must have meant a lot to 
me, and it was very special, but on a day 
to  day basis, she couldn™t visit. 
Q: Do you remember whic
h birthday party it was? 
A: I think it was my fifth -- 
fifth and sixth birthday parties.
 Now, I -- as I say, I could 
not visit her, she could not visit me, but bi
rthday parties seemed
 to be kosher.  
Q: So this would be 1934 - ™35? 
A: Mm-hm, yes. 

Q: 
Hitler
 came into power in 1933. 
A: ™33. 

Q: What was your very first me mory of him? 

A: I think one of the mo st frightening thin
gs were the parades through our streets. 
And I mentioned the bay window earlier on,
 which gave wonderf
ul visibility to 
everything that was going up a
nd down  the street. And th e night that the brownshirts

were having their parades, I remember my
 nanny hold ing me in her arms  and we 
were watching it. It was nighttime, it wa
s with candles lit and loud singing and -- 
and boisterous goings on on th
e street. And I wish I could tell you what year th at 
was, that I don™t remember. 
But I remember the fact -- oh, I remember the fact, I 
remember the shirts, I 
remember the glistening on the 
black boots. And we were one 
story up. Bu t it seemed like endless numbers
 of people were marching and marching 
and marching. And ye
t, that part of 
Germany
, I think was not as badly off as other 
parts of 
Germany
. Somehow we were late, I think, 
in receiving the blows, so to 
speak. I think things were worse in other pl
aces, but I do recall this vividly and ev en 
today when I talk about it, I get a little chilly. 
Q: What did your nanny say to
 you? Do you remember if 
she tried to comfort you or 
said anything sp ecial? 
A: I think sh e held me. She hugged me. Sh
e herself was so appalled at what was 
going on, I think, and unders
tandable for her. And for 
Maria
, our -- our help in that 
-- our live-in help in the house.
 Maria
 was a very simp le Polish woman, who did all 
the housework fo r us, and was -- and lived
 with us, and when  she would go to 
church  and come home, she would always tell
 us what the father™s sermon was, each 
week. She would sh are that with us. She wa
s totally against the 
regime, although her 
brother was a me mb er of the Nazi party, 
and I reme mb er having

and he sat out in th e kitchen with her wh
ile she was prep aring coffee or something. 
And he proudly showed  off the lap -- other si
de of his lapel, with a swastika attached 
to it. When he came into th
e house he had th e good sense of putting it on the reverse 
side. Most of the time I think he had it on th
e real side, he was a Nazi of the first 
order. Bu t not his sister. 
Maria
 was a gentle, wonderful soul
, with whom we kept in 
touch through th e war -- not during the 
war, but after the war. She wrote to my 
parents and she wrote as long as they allo
wed mail to go thro ugh and I have le -- her 
letters t-to this day. And she actually
, after my  grandmother was deported, she 
actually walked out of the ho
use and walked til she came ac
ross to the Czech side of 
the border. She couldn™t stand being in  
Germ any
. And she say -- she went into the 
service of a priest in 
Czechoslovakia
 and survived the war.  
Q: What does it mean to a 
little girl to see a swastika? 
A: Then, or now? 

Q: Then. 
A: I think frightening. Terrifying to -- to sa
y the least. I of course didn™t understand 
the ins and outs behind it all, but there wa
s something frighten ing about the image. 
Q: Did your parents ever explain anything
 on their own, or 
did you go up and ask 
them? Granted, you were very young.

A: I don™t think that I was old enough to
 ask the right questions. They, of course, 
tried to shield me. Thin
gs got very difficult in 
Ratibor
. My father, who was in 
private practice, when the decree came out 
that only Jewish patients could go to 
Jewish docto rs, his patients, of course ha
d to hold off coming. Alth ough strangely 
enough in  the middle of the night, very of ten the back door knocked, it was a patient 

who didn™t want to be seen entering th e do
ctor™s house, would 
co me. And of course, 
my  father saw him. And patients asked hi
m to co me an d  see th
em. And he did not 
have a car, and in th e early days he went 
to see his patients by bicycle. But later on, 

he got a mo torcycle, yeah, a big do -- it was 
my father and his pale green mo torcycle 
and his one piece suit, whic
h covered him all the way from over his head, to his 
shoes, with a zip in front. We
nt to see his patients in 
Poland
, and he would take his 
mo torcycle and go over. And th ere was the st
anding joke, he stopped at the -- at the 
customs bureau -- at the customs office to
 get his papers signed that he was going 
across the border and about an
 hour later he would come
 back and the border guard 
sniffed -- he would sniff, oh Dr. 
Fischer
, you have just seen a patient? Yes, and the 
payment was two wonderful Po lish sausages 
that were hanging on the inside of his 
suit. They knew it, they looke
d the other way. It was just -- it was an  -- an accepted 
norm. And so people did co
me and he did still help pe
ople who needed help, i-if 
they could ju st get to his hou -- to our ho
use and not be seen. But one mo rning -- and

I don™t remember what year it was, there 
was a big yellow sign pl
astered all over the 
entryway . And 
Ma ria
 went outside as always to pick
 up the milk and the fresh rolls 
that were left at the doorstep and sh
e removed the sign. And the sign said, 
De Jude 
lugt.
 The Jew lies. And she tore it o
ff very quickly and tore it up. 
Q: How did you know about this? 
A: My father told me. Yeah. And I think 
maybe that was sort of the beginning of 
when  he thought probably it would be better 
to move to a larger city, and so -- and 
many people did move from the smaller town
s, hoping to  find their place and a 
better way of life in the larger
 city. So  in 1936, I think it was 1936, he decided to go 
to 
Breslau
. And so there was movement afoot to
 move the family, mother and me, 
up to 
Breslau
. Bu t the move was going to  be a 
difficult one, he already saw the 
handwriting on the wall. And so I was sent to 
Berlin
 to stay with my other granny, 
my  mo th er™s mo th
er, who lived in 
[indecipherable]
 in
 Berlin
, and also, I was not 
allowed to go to  school any mo re. Jewish 
children were not allo -- were not accepted 
at school any mo re, so it -- there was a duel 
reason for moving. I ha
d to go to Jewish 
school. And there was no Jewish scho
ol. There were too few people in 
Ratibor
 for a 
Jewish school to be there, so I was 
sent to live with my  grandmother in 
Berlin
 and to 
continue my  education at a Jewish school, which I did, wh ile my  parent 

[indecipherable]
 wh ile my  parents were moving.

Q: Do you reme mb er what some of your th

feelings were when 
you had to leave to go to 
Berlin
? 
A: I disliked it with a vengean
ce. I did not want to go to 
Berlin
 and I have letters 
that I wrote home, I have them in my  keep
. Please take me home, I don™t want to 
stay here, I don™t like 
Berlin
. It was all very strange to me, and living with my 
grandmother was sort of an unknown, I di
dn™t know her really that well. And she 
was a darling, kind, wo nderful person, bu
t it wasn™t my mother  and it wasn™t my 
father and I didn™t know my surroundings. 
No t a soul did I know other than her, and 
I was deeply, deeply  unhappy in  
Berlin
 and I had to stay ther
e through maybe one or 
two semesters. And by that time, 
Moth er and Father had moved to 
Breslau
, but this 
was a sort of an interes
ting thing, they were not 
allowed to live with my 
grandmother. My grandmother had an enorm
ous house, really. Beautiful house with 
spectacular gardens, a flower garden and a 
vegetable gard en and a fruit garden  and a 
-- it was really -- it was a se mi-attached -- semi
-detached? Semi-att
ached. Well, they 
were two houses together, but they were 
both enormous, and wi-with lots of help. 

There was a gardener, and there was a la
dy who came in and 
did the laundry and 
there were two people who just cleaned and 
co oked  and washed an d did things in the 
house. And she had some borders because sh

away of natural causes 
in 1936, I think it was and so th
ere was plenty of room for us 
to have a very comfortable existence in th
e main house, but the Nazi wouldn™t have 
that. We weren™t allowed to live in th
e same  house unless it was in servant™s 
quarters. And so  we did, we lived in the 
servant™s quarters of the house. We were 
very, you know, it -- it was just another form
 of breaking the spirit. But we made the 
best of it, my  folks did really very , very 
well in -- in adjusting to the new life. My 
father opened an office in 
Breslau
 and immediately had a fairly sizable practice -- 
practice. And th ings were moving along. No
t well, but they were moving along.

where the nanny wasn™t on duty  for the

were many other young people who -- with 
whom I grew up. Many -- several of them went to 
Israel, 
one was

 who went to 
Israel
 and has made a g o od life for herself, i-is still living 
there now, I have not kept up with --

Vera

Laura 
Mamlock,
 daughter of the ear, nose and throat Dr.

 and my  parents were in touch with the 
Ma mlo c ks

Q: Wh-W hen you say these people left, 
do you rememb er specifically when  -- all

A: I think that they left in 1937 -- ™38. 
™37 or ™38, and they were very fortunate, 
those two families, of bein

may-maybe more of this later. Other friends were the 
Ba ums, 
Dr. 
Baum
 went to 
Israel
, he was a pediatrician and his 
children and grandchildren are in 
Israel
 now. 
His son, unfortunately lost an arm in 
the 1948 war. And the whereabouts of several 
other people, I really don™t know
. I know that my dear friend 
Ilse Meyer -- Mayer -- 
Meyer 
didn™t make it, nor did 
Yurachem
 -- forgotten his name at the moment, his 
first name was 
Yurachem
, but he di -- he also -- 
Yurach em Vaber
 did not make it. 
And I have seen the fact that they did 
not make it in the files of the -- of the 
Yad 
Vashem
 database. And many of the teachers 
that I had also, unfortunately were 
unable to -- to escape. But 
Ra tibor
 was a nice little city to
 grow up in, it was a 
charming town, winter was wonderful, we ha
d snow and skating. We had a pond in 
the middle of the town and it froze in th
e winter, and the entire li-little town was 
there skating. In the summer my father to
ok a boat and rode us all around in the 
boat. It was -- it was a good time, it was a ni
ce time for -- for only a short period of 
time though, unfortunately. 
Q: What was the first day of school like? 
A: Oh, first day of school was very excitin
g because every child who started sch ool 
was given a cornucopia filled 
with candy. It™s called the 
Osted Tuete.
 It -- the 
Easter cornucopia because school starte

bed and she brought it to me and it was such  an exciting occasion. In fact, I have 
some pictures to verify the fact that it wa
s really an occasion to
 be remembered. And 
of course, we went to scho
ol. School was an extremely 
formal affair. We did not 
wear uniforms, but we were very regiment
ed. We had 42 childre
n in a class of -- 
with one teacher. And school was from ei
ght in the morning 
until one o™clock and 
then we were through. We a
ll brought our little lunch in l
unchboxes that were hung 
around our necks, sort of second breakfas
ts, my mother called 
them. And then we 
had -- wh en  we got home after one o™clock it was dinner, dinnertime. And th e 

curriculum when we started 
included of course, the 
usual reading, writing and 
arithmetic. But it also includ
ed art and mu sic and gym, and religio us studies. And to  
that end 
Halp y
 
Befelt
 was my religious teacher, and I st-still have the Bible books 
that I used, written in 
German
, of course. And once or twice a week he came, not to 
the school itself, but to a building close to
 the school, and we all walked over and 
took our studies while the catechism was bei
ng taught to the Catholic children in the 
si -- in the class. I think boys and girls we
re separate in school
, I™m pri -- I™m sure 
they were, but to religious sc
hool we all went together.  
Q: Did you experience ana -- 
any anti-Semitism from any of
 the other children at the 
school, or any of the 
non-Jewish teachers? 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

21
A: Yes. I think one of the eye open ing ex
periences to me was 
when an in -- an 
inkwell was thrown at me. And I think I 
was terrified. It was 
by one of the other 
children. That frightened me. The other thing 
that really upset me was the fact that 
we had ro w monitors who were supposed to 
take care of people not speaking or 
misbehaving, and if they di
d talk to anybody or in an
y way misbehave, the name 
was given to the teacher. And I remember getti
ng more sh -- of my shares of -- of -- 
of censure to talking or misb
ehaving than I really
 should have gotten. And of course 
the result was that there wa
s a stick that was used and was really -- we rece -- I 
received a whipping on both
 my hands every time I was 
unget zeigt,
 which meant, 
pointed out. And that I think 
kind of really ma -- discouraged me. And so mehow the 
teachers, I don™t know, they 
turned their backs on these 
things. For what reason, I 
don™t know. For example, when  we walked  
down the street, we -- and we had to wa 
-- we saw a  teacher, the -- the way to acknow
ledge it was to raise one™s hand and to 
say, 
heil Hitler
. I couldn™t do it and my  parents abso
lutely forbade me to do it, and 
so I just curtsied. And th
e teacher, instead of acknowledging th e curtsy, would look 
the other way. But of course, she didn™t do 
anything to -- to upset me, but it was that 
-- but in itself was upsetting to be looked 
over and not acknowledged. And so it was 
with most of the teachers. I 
think that they were being th
reatened and -- and we were 
being threatened in a way, 
too. That was a hard time.

Q: Were there pictures of 
Hitler
 in the classroom? 
A: I don™t rememb er. I really don™t reme mb er
, but picture or not, he was there in -- 
you know, in -- just in so many little, sma
ll details. For example, there was every 
week or so, the pot was po -- passed around for money for 
Wintahilfe
. Winter help 
for meals for -- for indigent people or m
oney being raised for unusual causes, and 
you realized, of course, that the causes were
 the party, but you ha
d to give. So  that 
was another somewhat humiliating experience. 
But the fact that the teacher believed 
the children who -- whose hate was really being taught at home, and who took it out 
on -- on us, that was -- that was unpardonable. 

Q: Wa-Was this something you talked a
bout with the other -- your other Jewish 
friends? Did you ever ta
lk about such things? 
A: You know, I don™t remember that. I reme
mber talking to my parents about it, but 
I don™t rememb er talking to  other children about it. 
Q: And what would your parents say? 
A: I don™t -- I real -- I just don™t remembe
r. I don™t remember. All I know is I have 
some pictures in my picture album in wh
ich I™ve got hanky in hand, and I rememb er 
the incidents, telling my mother and sh
e was deeply, deep ly unhappy. And you 
know, I think what I™ve learned, and I™ve --

want to make my  parents unhappy. And 
so rather than make them unhappy, I 
wouldn™t. 
Q: Would you describe
 yourself as a very independent ch ild? 
A: Yes, I think so. I think so . I was fairly 
independent. I wasn™t 
a very good student, 
I was a very average student. And according to
 my report cards, all o f which I have 
from 
Germany
, I was not very artistic either. Mu
sic was better than art, I think. 
Q: We-Were you athletic? 
A: No. I don™t think so, but I did exercise 
well. I mean, I -- I was not athletic, but I 
was flexible and -- and I enjoyed games. Bu
t athletic per se, I don™t think so . I don™t 

think I was ever very athletic, althoug
h I did play basketball on my  high school 
team, and in college. But that was onl
y because I™m very tall for a woman. 
Q: Did you as -- during that young childhood
 have any hobbies, or things that you 
liked to do, like reading? 
Anything outside of school? 
A: I loved to draw, an d I liked to do handwo rk and my  grandmother taught me how 
to crochet. And -- and I liked -- y-yes, I -- 
I -- I did like that very much. I liked to 
sing and my  mo ther and I sang a lot togeth e

pleasure the children™s folk songs
 that we -- we sang together.

 any one of the songs?

me think a little bit.  
Q: Okay . 
A: I™ll go into song later. 

Q: Okay . And so  you said you had the Jewi
sh instruction once a week  and so forth, 
yeah, yeah. Well, se -- speaki
ng about singing and music --  
A: The Jewish instruction di
d not at this point in tim
e, in clude Hebrew. It was 
Biblical stories mostly and the Hebrew ca
me later, unfortunately. I wish it had come 
at -- at much earlier age because I was at 
a tremendous disadvant
age when I changed 
schools, not having had early Hebrew training. 

Q: When  you ch anged schools to 
Berlin
, is that what you mean? 
A: Yes, when I changed schools to 
Berlin
 and particularly to 
Breslau
, everyone was 
able to read Hebrew quite fluently, and I was struggling terribly with it. And I really 
think to this day, I really 
struggle with Hebrew. I have learned French easily, of 
course the German and the English no pr
oblem, but with Hebrew, to this day I 
struggle. And I wonder how much this is 
a little resistan ce on my part. Not willing, 
mind you, but sort 
of subconscious.

Q: Mm-hm. Is -- yo-you had started to sing
 a song and I was sa
ying something about 
mu sic, and did you have 
any experience with the Jewish orchestra, the 
Kulturbund? 
A: Of course I didn™t, I was too young, but in -- in 
Ratibor, 
for a -- a -- quite a while 
we were allowed to go to thea
ter -- to the theater and to  the movies, and to  mu sical 
events. But the last one that -- the last cine
ma that I saw  was in 1936 at the time of 
the Olympics. And after that we were not
 allowed to go to th
e movie theater any 
more. And I think it was after th
at ti -- point in time that the 
Kubu
 -- th e
 
Kulturbund
 came and did its outreach program to
 the smaller cities and towns and 
brought wonderful people to sing and to 
play and so on. One 
was, for example, 
Alexander Kipnis, 
who came. And I rememb er my fa
ther, who was very active in 
these circles, getting all dressed up, I thin
k it was tails. A nd my mother in her very 
finest. And it was an evening of 
Alexander Kipnis
.
 
I remember this very well. And 
there must have been ot
her occasions when the 
Kubu
 came down, but this -- this is 
the one th at stands out in my  mind. Also
 my father, who was a cigar smoker and a 
pipe smoker -- apparently before the perfo
rmance there was a dinner and I think he 
pulled out his cigar and 
Alexander Kipnis
 made some very unpleasant remarks 
about people who smoke. It sticks out in my  mind. 
Q: Where did this concert take place? 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

A: The concert was actually 
in the social hall of the 
synagogue and the synagogue 
mu st have been an old church th at 
was taken over by th e Jewish community. I 
remember it very lovingly, 
my father sat downstairs. My
 mother, who sang in the 
choir sat upstairs and I was allowed to s
it with my mother. Mother was not only a 
memb er of the choir, but did th e solo work  for 
Yizker
 service and sang just very , 
very beautifully. On  the side of the syna
gogue was a little courtyard and nice things 
went on including, in 
my  memo r y , wo nd erfu l
 Sukko th
 that was built each year with 
tables laden with fruits and vegetables a
nd goodies to eat. And lo vely decorations 
from a roof that was made of greens, and it was just such a delightful time for the 

children. We also had -- I guess it was like a 
club, but I can™t -- I can™t be a hundred 
percent sure, but I know that I -- one 
Sunday I guess it was, we mad e lead 
candlesticks for ourselves. Very tiny lead candlesticks, we were allowed -- they had 

some forms and I guess they poured the 
lead and each child went home with two 
candlesticks. They were big enough to take
 maybe a birthday candle, but it was so 
special and I still have them, and my gran
ddaughter now has them
. So they™ve come 
a long way and they  were very dear. But a 
lot went on in the 
synagogue because of 
the social hall. In fact, plays were given 
and there were readings and lectures came. 
And all this happened in the social hall of
 the synagogue, which 
was pretty much in 
the downtown area of 
Ratibor
, and
 Ratibor
 was a pretty little town, not far from the

synagogue for example, was the marketpl
ace. And I know th at my  mo ther went 
marketing many times during the week b
ecause of course we didn™t have a 
refrigerator, we only had an icebox. And so sh e went marketing. But besides getting 
fish and vegetables and things like that
, they also had pottery, and it was called 
[speaks German]
. And they were wonderful pottery 
sh apes and to day, when  you go 
into 
Pier One
, sometimes you can see pottery made in 
Poland
. It™s blue and white 
usually, and a very nice, repetitive, simple
 design, a repeat design on the pottery. 
And very charming, very attractive. It hasn
™t changed a whole lot since then. I kind 
of -- I think it™s very lovely and I recall 
going to potter™s market
 with -- with my 
mother. 

Q: What was the name  of the synag
ogue and do you know the -- where it was 
located? 
A: I do not know the name. I could draw 
it on a map, where it was located. I don™t 
know the name of the street, but I do know
 it was on the corner of th e place wh ere 
the 
Marcus
 Furniture store was and 
the st-story about the

much merriment. It was 
just a -- an unforgetta
ble evening. And -- 
Q: What -- what did you know about the 
United States
 as a young child? Did you 
have any idea of what it represented to you? 
A: I don™t know whether it was at this point
 in time or whether it was a little bit later 
because at this point I was what, seven or 
eight years old, but my
 greatest fear of 
perhap s coming to the 
United States
 or 
Canada
 was I was so afr a
id of the wolves. 
Four legged ones. I was petrified to think 
that I was going to have to live in log 
cabin with ice and snow all around and the 
wolves in the neighbo
rhood. It was kind 
of frighten ing, but I think th e nicest, nicest
 story that my father told me, and I™ll 
remember to this day is, dear, he said, 
we™re going to  a land where even a Jew can 

become a person in the government. An
d of course he was talking about
 Bernard
 
Baru ch
. And I™m still a -- you can se
e, I™m still emotionally ve
ry touched by that. It

you asked me about wh at I knew about

the radio, on -- on -- and the yelling, and 
not really ever being able -- to this da

rds, they were so

garbled an d mispronounced. Bu t the tone 
of voice was so grating and th e sheer 
shouts of adulation and adoration were 
frightening in themselves. A nd I recall my 
father saying that he had heard, and I™m su
re this is so, everybody in the audien ce 
felt the fuehrer was looking in to his eyes. 
One was a -- a person was standing there, 
one in 10,000 but each one felt that he had 
been individually touched by this, you 
must say, charismatic character. It wa
s frightening and the mu sic was frightening 
too. The -- the -- the marching music and the 
boots, the boots, the boots. The beat of 
the boots, oh, very frightening. 
Q: You had spoken about one para
de. Were there many parades in 
Ratibor
 while 
you were there? 
A: There were a number, I wouldn™t say ma
ny, because we left before there were 
many, but there were quite a number that I 
recall. I even recall the night that there 
was a fire in a building not too far away 
from us and it was always a question as to 
why the fire. Was it a set fire because there we
re Jews living in that building, or was 
it a Christmas three that -- it was o n  Chri
stma s -- whether it was a C h ristmas tre e 
that was responsible for it. I don™t think 
anybody ever knew, but I associate that 
picture along also with the marching, th
e marching, the beat. It ma y not have 
happened at the same time, 
b u t  in  my  memo r y  was v e ry  
-- it mu st have been very 
close together. And of course the -- the 
birthdays that were always celebrated,

Hitler™s
 birthday and other notab le occasions. 
And then there were always special 
parades. 
Q: What -- what would you do on 
Hitler™s
 birthday? 
A: We wo uld stay at home. We would not go out. It was not worthwhile 

jeopardizing oneself. And still we -- there in -- in 
Silesia
 were so much better off, I 
think, than people in the other parts of 
Germany
. It was a little bit later in coming to 
us. It was as severe, but it was a little later. 
Q: Were there banners, Nazi banners 
hanging from buildings in your town? 
A: Yes. I believe that the -- the official 
building was -- had banners on th em -- flags. 
And of co urse you co uldn™t miss them, the br
ight red just was like blood hanging. 
That I recall. I don™t -- you ask me about pictures of 
Hitler
 in the classroom. I don™t 
know. There may have been the flag, but I™m
 not su -- I™m really not sure. That I 
don™t recall. 
Q: Did you have to ha -- ever have to say 
heil Hitler 
in the classroom, to the 
teacher? 

A: In the classroom, I don™t remember. Oh, 
it must have been. It must have, but I 
don™t think that -- I don™t think that I rais
ed my arm, but I coul
dn't swear to that. 
That I™m -- I™m a little unsure 
of, but I do know very we

upset by the experience of not being recogniz
ed. Although, they trie
d to be fair with

was graded down in my
 -- in my studies. 
I™m sure I wasn™t. And I think 
in some respects these teac
hers were going through so 
much themselves, because usually, pe
ople who did become
 teachers in 
Germany

A.
 And can you tell me about celebrating Passover in 
Ra tibo r
? 
A: Well, my most vivid memory of si -- Passover 
Seders
 were celebrated with my 
parent™s very dear frie
nds. The Passover with the 
Weisbarts
 are really in my 
memory very frequently because th

tely wonderful 
Seders
 together. 
The 
Weisbarts
 had a store on th e -- downtown in the rink area, the rink area of the 
down town part of
 Ratibor
. And it had all sorts of wonderful things like kitchen 
equipment and things for the house and they
 lived above the shop
 in a comfortable 
apartment. And just above them
 was a family by th e name of 
Rechnitz. 
And so on 
Seder 
evening, first night of 
Seder
, Frau 
Weisbart
, whose husband used to take me 
to synagogue on Satu
rday mornings and buy me thos
e delicious little rolls, had us 
over -- I think th ey had no ch ildren of their 
own. I don™t believe -- or perhaps they 
did, but at any rate, they were not there. 
He would conduct the service. We were all 
interspersed, sitting in -- at a long table 
and I also remember having f -- my four 
cups of wine and being a little bit out of it 
one year. But they had the most delicious 
sidoram
. The food was unbelievable and a par
ticularly good thing was a fish 
shodoe
. And I cannot spell it, I don™t know how 
to  tell you ab out it, but it was fluffy

and it was lemony and it had fish in it and 
it was wonderful. And there were children 
around th e table, and -- and a family by th e name of 
Rechnitz
, and it was a long 
evening, but always one that was a very, 
very happy one. I think I remember tw o 
years that we were there, and I™m sure ther
e were more years than that. What I think 
is particularly interesting, my husband is 
very interested in Jewish genealogy and I 
bring this in because it really does rela
te. There was a request about people who 
knew people in 
Ratibor
 and in that general area of 
Upper Silesia
 and I answered it 
and I said yes, I do know the area, and 
immediately a response came, would you 
happen to  know a -- I™m looking fo r the name 
Rechnitz
. And it came from 
somebody who was originally in 
Shanghai
. This was a Jewish family who went, 
instead of going west went east and fo und refuge in 
Shanghai, 
lived out the war 
years in 
Shanghai 
and then came to the 
United States
. And the name of the lady 
who made the request was 
Yvonne Adler
. And I said, this is very, very strange. I 
said, I saw a Mrs. 
Adler
 present almost every day when 
O.J. Simpso n
 trials were 
carried on. And they  sometim
es interviewed her, would 
you be the same one? She 
said yes, that was me.  So 
she wanted to
 know about 
Rechnitz
, and I said yes. And 
she said, I have no knowledge 
of their whereabouts. I said, I can tell you nothing 
perhap s of the mo ther and fa
ther, but the two daughters 
survived and are living in 
Israel
. She was delighted, needless to say. So
 then a little later 
a letter came. She

said, you know, I have a relative who lives in 
Rockville
. Is that close to 
Potomac
? I 
said yes, I think within, sort of, walking 
distance. And so we met in the relatives, 
and had th em over for a cup of coffee and 
enjoyed meeting th em. And in  between, 
every now and again, we still get on the ge
nealogy line and a -- express a word of 
greeting at Passover time, and just to stay
 little bit in touch. But it all revolved 
around the pass -- that Passover table. And I 
was able to fill a -- 
in a little bit on her 
family tree, and likewise she wa
s able to fill in a little bit 
of my family tree, because 
a distant cousin of my father™s was 
an editor of the Jewish newspaper in 
Shanghai
 
during th e years of the second World War. He was an editor in 
Breslau
, made a trip 
and stayed  in 
Shanghai
, lived out the years in 
Shanghai
 and apparently moved to 
Israel 
and unfortunately died th ere before we 
could make contact. But she was able 
to help us out in that part of our fam
ily tree, so the intern
et™s a great thing. 
Q: And what was his name, the gentleman who was the editor? 
A: Let me think. I have it, 
but it™s -- it™s not coming th rough 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: All right. W-We can come back to it later, it™s okay. 

A: Mm-hm. 
[indecipherable]
 

Q: Did your fami ly take vacations? 
A: Yes. And I™ve -- I have several memorabl
e vacations. My father and mother were 
great hikers and they  loved to
 hike in the mountains and 
so  very frequently we went

35
up to  the 
Tetra s
, and the 
Riesengebirge
 and walked and enjoyed the fresh air. I 
have happy memo ries of be
ing put into a sled driven
 by horses and being pulled 
through deep snow, and staying at a lodge, 
and en joying the -- the winter activities. 
Mostly -- it mostly was walking. But -- an
d this was all very well and good, we 
could go and do our vacations, go on our vaca
tions and stay at the lodges, or at the 
hotels, but a time came when they were taki
ng no more Jewish vi
sitors and so the 
vacation places were somewhat 
rationed and we had to go to
 places that were Jewish 
-- run by Jewish families for Jewish familie
s and that™s where we went on vacation. 
And I reme mb er going up to 
Swinemünde,
 wh ich is on th e 
Baltic
, where there was 
a very lovely vacation spot that catere
d to the Jewish trade. Was called the 
Möve
. 
And the 
Möve
 is a seagull and it was on -- on the water, and we went. I stayed one 
year with my  grandmother and one year 
I think I went with my mother. Yes, I 
reme mb er going with my  mo ther, because 
I had to do homewo
rk, so not to fall 
behind. And the German
 school year was a little bit different, but I was allowed to -- 
to miss a little time, as long 
as my  mo ther kept up with  
the assignments with me. But 
it was interesting to think that we were rea
lly isolated even in where we could spend 
vacation time. 
Swinemünde 
was rather fri -- to me was 
a little bit of a frightening 
place to be because the lodg
e where I stayed with my 
grandmother sa
t opposite of 
Peenemünde
. And that™s where the Ge
rmans were building their 
U-
boats and we 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
36
could see the white boats in the harbor, acr
oss the water. And we were well aware of 
the fact that in 1937, there 
were definite attempts at getting ready for a war. And I -- 
I still see in my mind™s eye 
the white -- the very white 
painted ships against very 
gray waters. And rather frightening 
looking, th ey looked like sharks.  
Q: Wow, mm-hm. Anything else in 
Ra tibo r
 that you wanted to talk about? 
A: There was a very -- in 
Ra tibo r
 was a very nice munici
pal swimmi ng pool, and I 
was given my  first instructions to swimmi
ng at that pool, I was five years old and it 
was a funny way of learning how to swim. There were ro -- there were 
L-
shaped 
rods -- well, actually probably fairly stable
 pipes that had ropes on th em, that were 
suspended over the water, and we were hooked
 onto these ropes, and were in a very 
safe place to study our strokes. And I -- I l
earned how to swim that way, I became a 
very good swimmer, v ery fast. And I re
memb er it was a miserable day and I was 

about to take my test to 
pass to get my  first card, and it required 15 minutes of 
uninterrupted swimmi ng around the pool, the e
dge of th e pool. And as I say, it was a 
dreary day, but my  grandmother was visiti
ng and she took me to the pool. And I 
passed, I even did 20 minutes, but in order to
 get your card you ha
d to jump in at the 
far end, into the deep water. This I could 
not do. I was a totally petrified creature. 
But they  said well, if you will jump, if we  put you on the harness and the rope, we 
will let you pass. And of course I did, and 
I got my certificate and I was the happiest

person in the world. But then that was closed
 to Jews after we left. It was no longer 
allowed for Jewish people to -- to swim th
ere. But at least I learned how to swim. 
Q: So th en you went off to 
Berlin
 while your parents settled -- were getting settled, 
and you were with your grandmothe
r. And how long did you stay in 
Berlin
? 
A: Actually, I think I probably was there le
ss time than in my 
imagination. I was 
there a matter of maybe six months. But I 
was so lonely, and my
 grandmother tried 
to make it so pleasant and co mfortable for me, but I was away from my  parents and I 
was very unhappy. I went to a school wh er
e I didn™t know anybody. It was a Jewish 
school and I didn™t know Hebrew  a
nd all the children knew Hebrew. I was 
devastated. However, the period came 
to an end and I saw a little bit of 
Berlin
. I 
don™t remember very much of it, I re
member where my grandmother lived, I 
remember where the beautiful 
synagogue was at which Dr. 
Joachim Prince
 was the 
-- the m -- the rabbi. I remember g o ing to a 
service there. I re -- I remember going to 
the zoo and to -- doing things 
that little children like to do,
 but in general I have a 

very, very limited memory of what went on 
there, as opposed to the very accurate 
memory I have of 
Ra tibo r
, where I c -- I can draw a map and I drew a map for my 
father some years back when -- and aske
d him whether he coul
d go over this map 
with me to see whether my
 memory was accurate, and 
he said absolutely. The 
memory of the street w h ere the dentist wa
s, and where the knit 
shop was and where

the market was and so on and so  forth. Bu t my  memo ry of 
Berlin
 is not at all that 
good. Ho wever, when  I moved back
 to be with my family in 
Breslau
, when I came 
back to 
Breslau
, I have a much better memory of that place. 
Q: When you were in 
Berlin
, did you see lots of eviden ce of Nazi party symb ols? 
A: Actually, I don™t even rememb er that. I 
think th ere must have been -- there mu st 
have been, but I cannot visua
lly pinpoint it as to wh ere I might have seen it. My 
grandmother, I am sure took me only to
 places that were permitted. It was 
interesting, my  uncle, my  mo ther™s younger brother went to 
Israel
. He wanted very 
much to emigrate to 
Israel
 and in 1935 or th -- ™36, he went to 
Israel
 and had a 
marvelous experience and wanted
 very, very much to go and settle there. He saw the 
handwriting on the wall and he wanted
 -- he had a chance to buy into 
Egged, 
the bus 
comp any. And my  grandmothe
r did not want to leave 
Berlin
 and she would not give 
him the money, although it was there in spades. The consequence was that 
Ludz 
did 
not go to  
Israel
, had a terrible time leaving 
Germa ny
, and my  gran dmother didn™t 
make it at all. There was a 
wonderful opportunity where the wrong turn was taken. 
You ask did I see much evidence? I just real
ly honestly cannot recall. Mm, I can™t. 
Q: Did your parents come visit you in 
Berlin
 while you were there? 
A: I don™t have memories of my parents vi
siting me at all because they were in the 
throes of moving and setting up a practice a
nd trying to start gettin g things ready for 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
39
a possible chance to -- to emig
rate. My mother was very 
reluctant to emigrate. She 
wanted more than -- she was sure this wa
s all going to blow 
over. My father knew 
better, or he -- he did indeed know better. He 
was sure t h at it wouldn™t and so at that 
point they were putting feelers out to see wh
at might happen and what ha -- in effect 
happened  was my  father, being a physicia
n was contacted by a number of countries 
in 
South America
 who were open ing their doors to
 physicians particularly. And it 
was either 
Urug ua y  
or 
Paraguay
, and I™m sh -- not sure that I remember, but one of 
the -- one of those two countries that made 
a most attractive offer, but my father, not 
Span ish speaking, not havi
ng had too mu ch  contact w
ith the Spanis
h speaking 
population decided th at might not be for 
him. He also did not want to go to 
Israel
, I 
might add. He was not at all set on going to 
Isr a e l
. But in the meantime, this 
wonderful telegram showed up, the one that 
really saved us when we were able to 
establish a family -- a blood conn
ection to someone who lived in 
Ca na da
. The 
question is, could we get into 
Cana da
, because 
Ca na da
 had a very  tight quota. You 
might know the -- the book, 6,000 is too 
many and indeed I don™t even think that 
they got 6,000, or allowed 6,000 in . Bu t an 
-- at any rate, perhaps this is not what I -- 
what I should be -- yeah. So
 my father turned down 
Uruguay
 or 
Para guay
, turned 
down  
Israel
, but was absolutely positive that we
 had to leave. And so my mother 
decided sh e better learn how to  do someth
ing. And so my  mo ther, who was a singer

40
and a lady who entertained beau tifully 
and who was a -- a homemaker at heart 
decided th at she would 
study and did study under 
ORT 
auspices, and studied 
physioth erapy. She had always
 loved a -- gym and exercise
 and physical culture and 
so on. Right up her alley, and sh e, in 
Breslau
 went to school and studied  
physiotherapy. And really, in effect, this 
step did keep body and 
soul together once 
we did co me to 
Canada
. And she loved wh at she was doing, and she did it for many 
-- well, for a number of years. 
So that was while I was in 
Berlin
, she also star ted on 
that and got -- got into class and worked .  
Q: And this is the Jewish Organization 
for Rehabilitation and Training. You said 

your father did not want to go to  
Israel
. Were your parents Zionists in any way? 
A: My parents were not 
Zionists. You know, in 
Germany
 there was the big schism, 
the blue and wh ite and the black and white. 
He did not belong to the blue and wh ite, 

although that changed too. I mean, 
he was the strongest supporter of 
Israel
 that 
anybody could wish for, but at the time of our
 move he thought he could not take the 
weather in 
Israel
. That was why. 
Q: Y-You said he was a psychiatrist. He obvi
ous -- he had an adult clientele. Did he 
have any kind of mo re of a specia
lty or just general psychiatry? 
A: Actually, when he went to
 school, and he went to sc
hool at the university in 
Breslau
 after he came back from the war, he 
studied neu-neurolo
gy and psychiatry, 

 
Interv iew with Rena te
 Fischer Chernoff 
June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
41
that was a -- a study that always went 
hand in hand. And th en he went for 
specialized work to 
Munich 
and studied in  
Mu n i ch
 for awhile before he actually 
went into practice. He dea
lt mo stly with adult patients and he did some very early 
work on mescaline, which became a drug a -- that was used for, I believe 
recreational, but it was a -- a very poten t dr
ug and he wrote one of the first papers on 
mescaline. And he also dealt with bromism,
 which I™m not sure 
I really understand. 
And then  he got very  interested and very 
in volved  with electric shock therapy, and 
was exceedingly successful with electroshoc
k until it was sort of downplayed, and 
was not used any mo re. And no
w th ings have come back and they  are using electric 
shock therapy, under perhaps better circum
stances because of the mu scle relaxants 
and things that go with it. But my father 
was exceedingly successful. I always felt he 
was out of favor with  the establishment be
cause his basis, from the e arliest  of al l 
times he said, we will find bi
ochemical and biologic basi
s for mental problems and 
diseases of the mind. And of co urse when 
Freud
 became so popular, he was not at 
all in the swing. And he stuc
k to his guns and I think th
e world has changed. He was 
more of a 
Jung ian
. He was extremely interested in what 
Jung
 had to tell us. And he 
really felt, and I think he was -- h-he -- it 
-- it came to pass that his way of thinking 
was quite right, quite on the ball. And he
 worked until he wa
s -- worked in his 
profession until he was 80 years 
old. And at that point in
 time he felt he couldn™t

42
keep up with all the new medications and th
en decided that this was -- this was not, 
you know, good for the patient. But he was 
quite successful in his -- in his work and 
he loved every minute of it. He was the 
sort of person who, if somebody in th e 
province, in 
New Brunswick
 when we came to 
Cana da
, was ill an d needed his 
help, he got into his car and drove 300 m
iles without batting an
 eye. If the patient 
needed  him, he was there. He made housecalls. 
Q: That is some kind of a housecall. 
A: Oh, yeah. Oh 
my gosh, yes. 
Q: All right, now you™re finished being in 
Berlin, 
you™re back with your family in 
Breslau, 
and how long did you stay there? 

 A: I would say probably only a year. It wa
s a very full year tho
ugh, because I had to 
get used to a new school 
and new surroundings. I lived 
fairly far away from the 
school, the na -- 
[tape break] 
Q: We were talking about your full year in 
Berlin. 
A: I -- 
Q: I mean in 
Breslau
 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Ah yes, I moved back to 
Breslau
 and I was star ted i n  the Jewish school in 
Breslau
, 
Ra ydia
 ar -- school and all children there were Jewish. All, or most 
everyone was trying to leave and -- and 
I think everybody™s mind was such that -- 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
43
that we were il -- we w ere losing pe
ople every day in school. I went to 
Ra ydia  
shula
, it was a Jewish school. It was a sizeable
 Jewish school, mu ch bigger than my  
school in 
Ra tibo r
, certainly ba -- much 
bigger than the one in 
Berlin, 
which was a 
small, little independent school. This was 
a large school, and almost all the children 
there were being prepared, really, to leave 
the country. Hebrew 
was very big in the 
curriculum and I was painfully
 inad equate. I did not like the school. I only made two 
friends while I was in school and it was -- it
 was a very unhappy time of my  life. My 
father started his new practice and my  gr
an dmother -- my  grandmother was having 
to rent out more rooms so that things 
would go reasonab ly well. She was made to 
give up the store at the point
 of a gun. This beautiful st
ore, this beautiful toy shop, 
the biggest one in the entire province of 
Siles -- 
of
 Silesia
, where people came from 
all over to buy. In fact, the people who had the 
guta
, the large farms, these enormous 
farms would bring their fami lies in at 
Christmastime to do th eir shopping at 
Ga rso n  
Frankel. 
That was the name of the store, wa
s the name actually of my great-
grandfather. The store had been in the 
family since 1826and 
my  grandmother was 
running it with her sister because both had 
lost their husbands, and they were made 
to sell it, as I say, because it was taken over. 
And I even have a clip
ping to the effect 
that it™s now Aryan, a big clipping from th
e newspaper. So she t
ook in borders into 
her big, beautiful home and 
everybody got along very we
ll. But it was not as it was

before. Still, she was able to have help in 
the house because help 
was still allowed to 
work. It was later that the help was not a
llowed to work for Je
wish people any mo re, 
but at that time, in that place, there was help.  
Q: Were the borders Jewish? 
A: I believe they were. I do believe th ey were. The house was one, two -- four 

stories high and the lowest part had th
e servant quarters of the gardener, which 
became our apartment. It was on the lowest
 level, the entry level and there were 
lovely sh rubs around it. I remember there 
were lilacs that smelled so beautifully, and 
Lilies of the Valley. Had a large iron gate th
at opened up to allo
w cars to move in. 
We di -- she did not -- we did not have a 
car. My father had his motorcycle, never 
drove a car until he came to 
Ca na da .
 And then there was the 
rote deala
. That was a 
red foyer wh ere when  people came to vis
it, left their coats before being sh own 
upstairs. And th at was, of course, my  fa
vorite place to play because everything was 

so beautiful. Red satin or velvet or plush,
 very beautiful, with a bay window looking 
out into  the shrubs. And then th e back or si
de part of it had a huge kitchen. It was 
not a kitchen for cooking th ough, it was an
 area to do the laundry. And ev ery week 

the laundresses c ame i n  and that was alwa
ys great fun fo r me because they would 
hand wash everything on boards
 and th en they  would rinse it and then dry them, and 
then at the end of the day th
e tw o of them would take th
e sheets, one standing at one

end, one at the other and they would pull th
em in order to dry th em comp letely and 
my  greatest joy was to stand underneath in 
the middle and have my  hair fly up into 
the sheets. It was such a joy and it was so 
mu ch fun. That was so much fun. We had 
a lovely gardener who took car
e of the garden , which had a 
walk all around it so that 
one could stroll around a central green area.
 And then  the borders
 were all peonies 
and ro ses and lovely  shade flowers and tall 
trees. And then there was a small garden 
arch that led into the fruits and vegetabl
e gard ens. And we ha
d gooseberries. Never 
see gooseberries any mo re. 
And red and white currants 
and raspberries and apple 
trees and peach trees. It was -- it was a pa
radise, it was absolutely lovely, and the 
gardener worked hard
 to do -- to keep it so. And 
th e back of the house had an 
enormous balcony so  that one co uld sit in

A: Once my  grandmother was found and was ab
le to establish contact with a distant 
relative who had emigrated to 
Canada
 mu ch earlier, and I wish I could tell you 
exactly when, I don™t ec -- but, at any ra
te, he was a blood relative and action was 
taken to try to contact him and see whethe
r he could, in any way help out. His 
response was immediate and he said he coul
d, of course try to help  out but not 
monetarily because it was in the late 30™s and 
Ca na da
 was still reeling, as the 
States
, I know mu st have been after the depr
ession, and really no one had mu ch of 
anything. He -- Uncle
 Charlie
, his name was 
Charlie Redlish, 
had established a 
small institute where he tr
eated alcoholics. And it was 
very small and he ran it by 
himself with one nurse. But he apparently
 was successfu l enough, but I don™t think 
was getting paid exceedingly 
well because he and his wife
 and his married daughter 
and unmarried daughter, all -- 
an-and son and his wife all ha
d to live together in one 
flat just to be able to make it. But he 
was instrumental in ge
tting things going and 
very fortunately, his daughter 
Fay Redlish
 had a friend who was extremely well-to-
do. He was in the manufacturing business of
 men™s suits, and at the time just before 
the war, was starting to get contracts for ar
my  unifo rms, and apparently had an  in 
politically speaking. And 
Jack
 took it upon himself, and I think I™m right in saying 
this, that he went up to 
Ottawa 
to see whether there was some way of expediting 
bringing us into 
Ca nada
. Well, 
Ca na da
 had the law, of course, that only farmers 

 
Interv iew with Rena te
 Fischer Chernoff 
June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
47
and physicians could come in, and the other 
law, the law stated th
at they, if after a 
year™s time, the person could not make it on their own in 
Ca na da
, they would be 
sent back. So it was a trial run, so to sp
eak. In addition to fulfilling that, the person 
also had to bring 3200 dollars with them, 
which at that point in time I guess mu st 
have been a fair amount of money. And 
it took many months to actually get the 
permission to come, and once the permission 
was granted there was an awful lot to 
go through as far as the Ca
nadian authorities were conc
erned, but as far as the 
German authorities were concerned. Because 
they were on our ta
ils constantly about 
signing this paper and that paper. And duri
ng that period of time, many people were 
called to the police stations and never return
ed. This was a time 
in ™36 - ™37, when 
people were called on unbelievably small deta
ils to their leaving and to their lives, 
they were called, and they were made 
to jump off build ings. And this happened 
indeed, to  friends of ours. Well, I think I 
can tell you, one day my  father was called. 

We were trembling, I think all day long, bu
t he was one of the lucky ones. He signed 
whatever he needed to sign an
d pay wh atever he needed to pay and he came back. In 
the meantime we were granted permission 
and a van was ordered to pack  up our 
things. And I think it™s interesting to menti
on that we were allowed to bring things 
with us that had been -- that were old th
ings. So my  grandmother suggested that we 
take her furn iture because that could be ce
rtified as being old. I don™t know how -- I

-- I know it was 10 years on suits because my 
father had to go to his tailor and tell 
him to put labels into his suits which indi
cated wh en th ey were made, and he did. 
But the van was -- as I say, 
was ordered and some of the 
old pieces were packed  and 
-- and put in, but nothing of 
their modern furniture could 
come with them, it -- it was 
only the old things, wh ich -- wh ich was fine
. But when we were packing -- and my 
father ha-had a terrific library, and a w
onderful stamp collection, and when  the 
actual packing took place, the Nazi, with thei
r guns came, and they stood over us as 
we were doing the packing. And I remember
 very, very well, we were in our little 
downstairs gardener™s apartm
ent with lots and lots of 
boxes on th e floor, these two 
men with guns watching as my  father pack
ed all the books. And whenever they liked 
a book -- an  they particular
ly liked my children™s b ooks, they just helped 
themselves. And they helped 
themselves to some of my father™s stamps too, and 
there wasn™t a thing we could do about 
it. And I rememb er my father putting his 
hand to his mouth and saying shh. It was 
just, that™s the way it was done. Well, he 
still came o v er with a lot of books and I 
did come over with some children™s books, 
but I think my  best ones didn™t come with
 me . That™s all right. Bu t it was just, you 
know, the situation. Also, for example, it™s 
interesting; in that same apartment where 
we were packing the books, we were al
so taking our fo od, be
cause we were not 
allowed to eat with our grandmother upstai
rs. We had to eat separately. I mean, the

little downstairs apartment was like an independently organize
d apartment. They 
were allowed to bring the food down to  us, 
but we couldn™t eat it to gether with them 
upstairs. All the boarders could eat upstair
s and my  gran dmother could eat upstairs, 
but we couldn™t, and we 
had to eat downstairs.  
Q: How would your family 
know this rule, this regul
ation that you couldn™t eat 
upstairs? How were you told?  
A: Oh, you know, that I don™t rememb er. 
I don™t recall, but there would be -- day 
after day there would be leaflets left on 
th-the doorstep and people were checking 
up. So, I assume it mu st have been  thro
ugh those leaflets. Otherwise I -- I can™t 
imagine. But there were people always 
coming by and always checking up.  
Q: What about your going outsi
de to play with friends? 
A: I didn™t go out to play at all. I went to  school, but I rode my  bicycle on the side of 

the street. I took a streetcar to school a
nd I rememb er having to actually change 
places on 
Victoriastrassen
 and -- into another streetcar 
and th at seemed to be safe 
enough. I don™t remember having friends when I was in 
Breslau
 at all, because I 
was hardly there long enough 
and people -- there wasn™t 
that nice easy going back 
and fo rth to houses as there is in 
America
, it just wasn™t there. And surely not at that 
point in time. I only had -- I only made two friends wh ile I was in 
Breslau
. I wasn™t 
there that long, I guess, and the 
times were just not conducive.

Q: When  you would see a Nazi officer in
 uniform, do you d -- do you remember any 
visceral effects it had on you? 
A: You know, I must say I don™t. Again, I 
don™t rememb er, other than seeing them in 
groups. And yes, I was scared, terribly sc
ared because of what I remembered from 
Ratibor
. But I -- either I was held away from 
being put into that situation or it 
perhap s just didn™t register. I don™t know. I don™t know. I reme mb er in 
Breslau
 it 
was not a time to go to the movie theater, because we couldn™t. It was not a time to 
go to a concert because we couldn™t. And Ithink everything was in the home. There 
wasn™t much of that either. 
I think the times w ere so desp
erate. My mother went to 
class and came home. But I have
 to add this, because this I think is very important. 
My parents both decided it wa
s -- would be good if they
 took English lessons. And 
so they found out that 
there was a man, an Eng
lishman who was settled in 
Breslau
, 
who was giving lessons to people who were
 leaving th e country. My  parents decided 
to also study English, as many of their fri
ends were, a-and th ey went to the home of 
somebody who had come from 
England
 and who was doing something other than 
giving English lessons. But he 
gave English lessons on the side, and he gave them in 
the evenin g, and my  parents decided to ta
ke them. And first they walked into his 
home, and he™s -- they were sittin g at his desk
, he with his back to a huge picture of 
Mr.
 Moseby
. And who is Mr. 
Moseby
? He was the Nazi of 
England
. He was the

51
emissary there. Well, my mo
ther and father said, we™ve 
got to learn English, we™ve 
got to face
 Moseby
, and th ey went ahead and did 
and just disliked the occasion 
terribly but liked their teache
r. Their teacher was a very go
od teacher and a very nice 
person. So they neve
r could understand why 
Moseby
 was there, but he was there.  
Q: So th-th -- you said they con
tinued with their English lessons. 
A: Yes, they took their English lessons an
d they did rather well and at least got a 
little bit of a foundation and 
developed their hearing sk ills
 and along with taking the 
-- along with taking the 
ORT
 group, my  father also learned how to  concoct beau ty 
preparations. He learned how to make 
cold creams and va
nishing creams  and 
mo isturizing creams and all sorts of things pr
actical. And this stood us in very good 
stead, actually. And he bought jars, beautifu
lly designed jars and labels for the jars, 
so -- in English -- so that they could be at 
-- affixed to the jars that perhaps might be 
of -- of use on immi -- on immigration. So  
that was a time when
 you asked wh at did 
people do, my parents were very busy, 
taking classes and doing very practical 
things. 

Q: Did you know th ey we
re preparing to leave? 
A: I knew, yes. I knew that we were going
 to leave. When my
 mother -- when my 
father finally persuaded my  mo ther that we
 had no alternative, she came around to it 
and of course I knew, because of the 
papers that needed
 signing and the 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
52
documentation that needed to 
be gotten and the visits to 
ready ourselves, yes. And of 
course, when the furn iture was being packed
, I think it was very clear. It was very -- 
a very difficult time fo r my grandmother, be
cause unfortunately we could not bring 
her with us. The Canadian government put
 an age limit o n  those whom they would 
permit. And of course, she was not a trained person, either a farm
er or a physician, 
so she -- on her own she would not be ab
le to go. And she could not come as a 
memb er o f  th e family , mu ch  
to the everlasting sadness that my father went through. 
He was an only child and he was very clos
e to his mother, and I think he suffered 
terribly, just the fact that she had to stay behind. 

Q: What was her name? 
A: Her name was 
Hedwig, Frankel 
was her maiden name, 
Fischer.
 And th e store™s 
name was 
Garson Frankel
, it was her father™s and that
 family™s store. She was a 
good business lady, she was very interest
ed in genealogy. In 
fact, I™ve just put 
together lots and lots of genealogic data
, much of which she wr
ote down in German 
script. And since there are not too many of
 us left who can 
still re-read German 
script, I thought I™d best do that, and I™ve
 done it and I am so glad because it has 
opened up all sorts of interesting new ave
nues to investigate. And unfortunately she 
-- she was t aken to 
Belzec
. And you know
 Bel zec
, of course is a -- was a killing 
camp. So that was her demise. I -- I

Q: How old was she when she died? 
A: Well, we™re not really quite sure, but 
I know that I™m olde
r than she was when 
she died. In fact, I think she must have be
en 60. Probably  some
thing like that. I can 
look that up, I -- that I don™t know exac
tly. But she was the -- 
it -- it was so much 
fun visiting her when I was a little girl 
because she read stories to me and she 
introduced me to handwork . Sh e did beau tiful tatting and beautif
ul crocheting and I 
still have collars that she made me, which I have put into tissue paper, and have kept 
a tablecloth that she made for my  mo ther, and just lovely  handiwork .  
Q: So your family was prepar
ing to  leave. Were you kind of thinking of wh at to take 
with you, cause you know you
™d be leaving your home? 
A: I don™t think that I had any choice, because they could not buy things new for me, 

so I had to take what I had. And for themse
lves they couldn™t eith
er, so we went with 
what we had, we couldn™t really 
prepare in that sense, at all. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Nope. 
Q: So what was it like when  you ha
d to leave, for you emotionally? 
A: Well, I remember taking leave from 
my  grandmother -- my  grandmother in 
Berlin,
 we said goodbye to earlie
r on. Wh en we moved to -- 
I think she came to  visit 
us and we said goodbye 
then. My grandmother in 
Breslau
, with whom we stayed,

we said goodbye and -- and it was a very -- 
it was a very quiet time. And I remember 
that one of the people who rented rooms 
from my  grandmother was a pianist, and he 
played one of
 Chopin™s
 etudes. And to  this day, when  I hear that etude, the tears 
come -- welled up in -- welled up in my eyes
. This -- there was not much to say. I 
think we all knew that this wo
uld be the last time and we we
re taking leave. It was -- 
it was tough, very tough. I don™t remember 
how we got to where we went, I mean to 
the station, but I know we went by train. 
I don™t know how we got there. We went 
by train from 
Breslau
 to 
Hamburg
 and in 
Ha mb urg  
we had to undergo medical 
checks with  a Canadian doctor. And th at was not a nice experience, but it was done. 
My mo ther, who very  early in her life deve
loped glaucoma, she was in her 40™s, she 
thinks that the doctor who examined her, 
Canadian doctor who examined her, mi ght 
have had a suspicion that there was someth
ing th ere, but he didn™t let on. All she 
remembers is that she was 
forever getting her eyes ex
amined. Now, she was an 
undiagnosed glauco ma 
[indecipherable]
, so imagine if she had had the glaucoma 10 
years before and they  would have told her 
about it, she might never have gone blind. 
Because she did eventually 
become blind. But yes, we passed our exams, our 
physicals. 
Q: Did they check you? 
A: Yes.

Q: How did they do that? 
A: All over. All over and then some, a little 
bit more than they 
really needed to, I 
think, but I passed. And -- 
Q: Was your mother able to st ay with you du
ring the time? 
A: Yes, yes, she was. But it was -- you know, 
I was a little girl, nine years old. It was 
not -- it wasn™t my doctor, the one that I 
was used to, and being patted all over by a 
strange person who was not -- whose language
 I didn™t understand, was not a happy 
situation.  
Q: What month in 1938 was this? 

A: Well, I figure it mu st have been  June, or
 July. June or July. 
My mo ther™s brother 
came to see us off -- I mean, came to 
Hamburg 
to see us before we took our leave, 
and oh well, we were hoping th
at we would see each other again. And we did. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But it was very iffy, because he hadn™t gotten permission to leave 
Germany
, and 
it was late 30™s -- mid-30™s. 

Q: The 
anschluss 
had taken place in March of ™38, wh en 
Hitler
 ma rched into  
Austria
. Did you -- were you aware of that, or did your parents tell you ab out that? 
A: Yes, they did, and they -- I could -- 
you know, interestingl
y enough, they  didn™t 
have to tell me. There was so much electrici

And hearing particularly wh at was happeni
ng, through th e maids, who went out and 
did their shopping and who we
nt and -- to church. We always were aware of what 
people were thinking and what they  were ta
lking about. I think it came -- it came as 
a bit of a shock, I think. 
But then my father -- by that
 time my fath er had already 
made up his mind to go, and I think th at rein
forced his judgment. 
It was just such a 
nerve-wracking time to be th
ere. One had to watch ones 
P™s 
and
 Q™s
 so carefully. 
Didn™t say anything in public, didn™t ha
ve an -- you know, ev
en -- even when -- 
when  you went for little walks, you™d look around and sort of make sure that nobody 
was hearing your conversation. It was fraught
 with -- with all so
rts of intangible, 
unpleasant things.  
Q: Did you see any violence on the street? 
A: I don™t think so. I wasn™t on the street
 long enough, really. I -- I was fairly well 
sheltered. I don™t -- that I don™t recall. Bu
t I recall the dinner conversations wh en so 
and so was asked to come up to the Gestapo 
and so and so lost his business and such 
and such  a person was asked for ex tra docum
entation, wh ich of co urse they didn™t 
have. And it was -- it was just an unsure 
and uncertain and nerve-wracking time. 
And I think my mother, who was a bit of an  insomniac must have suffered terribly. 
But you know, life continued and it™s amazin g  that it does, but it did.
 
And bi -- after 
Hamburg
 and having the medical exam
 and seeing our -- my Uncle
 Ludz
, we were

put on th e train and we left for -- for
 Holland
 first, on our way to 
England
. And I 
don™t rememb er the day that it was, but it mu st have been  -- it was in the summer of 
1938, and we were on the train from 
Hamburg
 to 
Hoek van Ho lland
, which was 
the port, the seaport in 
Holland
, before getting on the little peanut boat to 
Greenwich. 
And I remember we had second cla
ss tickets. My father had gotten 
those and we were to get on th e train and 
we were entering th e second class carriage 
when  somebody came waving a paper. Dr. 
Fischer
, Dr.
 Fischer, 
would you kindly 
move over into the first clas
s carriage? My father said 
he had second class tickets. 
Yes, but it would -- it would be better if we
 went into the first class carriage. I 

reme mb er it so vividly, but the second cl
ass carriage had red leather seats, and first 
class carriage had green velvet seats. I was 
dressed -- what is it, to the sevens? To 
the fours? 

Q: To the nines. 

A: To the nines, well okay, I was very nice
ly dressed with while
 gloves. I remember 
my  mo ther slipping several rings on my  fi
ngers and telling me to keep my  gloves on, 

which I did. But we were ushered into th
is very nice carriage and sat with not too 
many people, whereas the other carriage was 
very, very full, and we came to the 
border and I know we came to the border 
because there was my  father, knowing 
exactly at what time that train was leaving 
Germany
 and getting into 
Holland
, 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

because he was waiting to be 
out of the clutches. Just 
before the border, the stop 
before the border, the train stopped. Second 
class carriage people left the train. We 
went on with out many of second class carri
age people. I™ll never forget it. I will 
never forget it. And my father to this da
y said, we were that lucky because of the 
English teacher with 
Moseby™s
 picture in back. He was trying to help people out of 
Germany
 in whatever way they could. My fath
er said he was very interested in 
knowing wh at trains we were taking. And 
really, my mother and father both, many, 
many times had said, if it hadn™t been for 
the English teacher, we mi ght not have 
gotten out of second cla
ss carriage. So we crosse
d the border. I remember 
everybody, we three, just 
hugging each other, crying 
and making our way over to 
Hoek van Holland
 and getting on our little boat. My
 father and I got very sick 
crossing the English channel. My mo ther, th
e good rider -- or sailor I should say, had 
no problems whatsoever, as she 
did on the voyage across the 
Atlantic 
as well. A nd 
we landed in 
Greenwich -- 
or 
Harwich -- H a rwich
. S-Sorry, 
Harwich
 I think it 
was. 
H-a-r-w-i-c-h
. Y eah, 
Harwich. 
And from there we took the train to 
Lo ndo n.
 
And in 
London
 my father had made arrangements for 
us to stay in a very nice hotel, 
which we have since visited. And we stayed
 there and h-he had fraternity brothers in

 and his cousin was in -- no, his cousin
 wasn™t there yet. But the fraternity

three days before we
 were to sail to 
Cana da
, I came down with appendicitis. Had to 
go to  the hospital emergency. Where did they
 take me? T o  the German hospital. Had 
to have my  appendix removed, an d fate
 again, fate unbelievable. I was on the 
operating table, about ready to have my  
appendix remo ved wh en the young surg eon 
who came and was about to do the job said
, oh, and what™s your name and where are 
you from, and said, is your father a phys
ician? Yes. And we -- we established the 
fact that my father was a physician, and he 
said, he helped  me out in my  final exam. 
I told this story to my fa
ther. He said, you know, he 
was trying to  keep calm, but 
sure enough, my father s
lipped him some answers when
 he was taking his final 
exam. And this was the doctor who took ou
t my  appendix. Bu t I had to stay in 
hospital for a week, I guess it is. I was ve ry well looked after, but it was a German 
hospital. And I suppose it was good th at I 
was there because I understood what was 
going on, and th ey understood what I -- 
and af -- we had to miss our boat to

This is tape number three,

your -- the boat. Before we get to that, 
did you have any special toys that you 
brought with you from 
Germany
? 
A: I had a lovely  doll, a
 Katie [indecipherable]
 doll and something happened to her 
between the -- in the last 20 years. I cannot 
locate her and I am desolate. Yes, mine

much else in way of toys. That was -- not 
even a Teddy bear, I do

doll. 
Q: You were nine years old at the time. 
Also, did you -- a-and 
you also said the 
Germans who were watching you while you
 were packing to ok some of your

 children™s books that
 you didn™t bring

ories about an imals and I still have them

But I loved fairy tales. My

think my joy in life was to be a princess,
 to have a crown on my  head and to eat 
noodle soup. I -- I don™t -- I can™t think of 
other toys. I did bring card  games. Some 
games and some puzzles. And I have the ca
rd games, they were quartets and they 
were quartets dealing with authors and w
ith flowers and with comics. Very funny 
comics from the newspaper, but 
they were in sets of f
ours. And also cards with 
letters so that one could make 
Scrabble
 words, but all as cards. Small, small things. 
But I think that™s all.
 Maybe a chessboard. 
Q: And -- all right, you™ve now recuperated 
from your appendix operation? And then 
what happened? 

A: I recuperated, and my  father of course
, had to scout around to find a new -- a 
voyage for us across the ocean and it was cl
ose to September and th e visitors were 
returning back to 
Ca na da
 after vacationing in 
Europe
. It was a particularly busy 
time of the year because the 
teachers were coming home on their trips and it was -- it 
was a bit of a -- of -- of a difficulty. Howe
ver, the Canadian embassy could not have 
been nicer. They foun
d my folks a place to stay becau
se staying at a hotel was too 
expensive, and they settled th
em in somebody™s home in 
Golders Green
, which is a 
f -- well-known Jewish community, and perhaps not so far away from the hospital 
either. And they arranged, 
through the Jewi -- with th
e help of the Jewish Aid 
Society in 
London
 to  get us a later boat over and we came over on the

which was a slightly smaller ship than wewere supposed to co
me on, but they had 
room for the three of us and we had a 
good voyage across the 
sea. At least my 
mo ther had a good voyage. My father and 
I took it downstairs. We w ere -- he and I 
were quite seasick. Not that it was such 
a hazardous journey at -- according to the 
information that I got from pier 21, it was 
a rather smooth journey, but our stomachs 
did not know that. My mo ther
 played ping pong onboard 
and we were downstairs.  
Q: Were there many refugees on the bor -- on the boat? 
A: No, th ere were not. There were -- I don™t 
think there were -- I -- as far as I know 
there were none, and I have the -- I have th
e entire list of the pe
ople in our class, 
tourist class, and we did not see Jewish name
s at all. M o st of them, as I say, were 
returning visitors to 
Europe.
 Did not at all. We did have iceberg practice and we all 
got into  our assigned jackets and had to pa
rade out. And we were
 very close to an 
iceberg. I think it™s as close as I™d  like to 
get to an iceberg. But it was a drill, an d of 
course everybody to ok part. There was a very
 nice party, I™m told, at the end of the 
ride. I don™t think my parents were in -- in
 a partying mood, but there was a party. 
And I should  mention to  you 
that the last day, the day 
that we were supposed to -- 
that we did in fact land in 
Montreal
, I woke up and could not move. I had total 
paralysis of both my  legs and my  father ha
d to carry me off the boat. This happened 
twice in my life. This was 
the first time, and the second time it happened when, as a

student in 1948, I had the -- and I was on an
 international student service semin ar, I 
had the opportunity
 to go back to  
Germany
 and the same thing happened. I woke up 
paralyzed from my  waist down. The paraly
sis did not last very long. My father 
carried me off the boat. Th
e relatives were there to 
meet us. And in a day the 
paralysis was gone. I think they  call this a 
hysterical paralysis, which it undoubtedly 
was. Terribly frightened.  
Q: What were you frightened of? 
A: This new life in a new country where 
we didn™t know the language, where we 
didn™t know anybody really, 
not even our relatives. I th ink just terrible fright. But 
you know, it happened that time, the first ti
me and we ascribed it to that. But it was 
interesting that it should happen -- what wa
s it, 10 years later? Again, and th-the 
return visit. And I™ve 
never been back to 
Germ any
, you know. 
Q: Did you know a
ny English at all? 
A: I didn't. Not at all. And I learned it ve
ry quickly. But for 
the first couple of 
months I was very silent, but after that I c
ould grapple with it quite nicely. I sat. My 
schoolteacher did not allow me to have a 
dictionary in school. She wanted me to 

absorb it totally by ear, which I guess pe
rhaps was the right thing to do. I was 
horrified that I couldn™t have my  dictionary
, but she didn™t allow it, and I learned it 
very well.

Q: So you settled in 
Montreal
? 
A: We came to 
Montreal
 and met Uncle
 Charlie
 and Aunt 
Bertha, 
the people who 
sent the telegram, and their children and it was decided that all of us, Uncle 
Char-
Charlie
, and his wife and th e daughter, married 
Wilfred
 and their son, and my  
mother and father and I would 
all take a flat together in 
Montreal
. And we did, and 
we all lived together for a number of years in one flat, where -- 
Q: When  you mentioned telegram what were you referring to ? 
A: Well, I think the telegram was sort of
 the lynchpin, if you will. This was a 
telegram th at arrived at the wedding, for 
the wedding of my  grandparents, sent by a 
distant relative in 
Ca na da
 by the name of 
Charlie -- Charles Redlish. 
It was a 
telegram th at was sent to send congra
tulations to the wedding of and the 
mishpo ka
 
of the grandparent, my gran dparents. And my
 grandmother kept that telegram, as she 
kept many, many things, and reme mb ered in
 the 30™s that ther
e was somebody in 
Canada
 who was distantly related. And th
is telegram really started the 
correspondence between my  parents and 
that distant rela
tive that lived in
 Mo n trea l
. 
And I have many copies of this telegram be
cause I feel it was the thing th at saved 

our lives. The one item that established 
a relationship with family abroad.  
Q: When  you started school, were you plac
ed in your chro nological grade, or a 
younger grade?

A: No, actually I started in grad e four and 
was in my  -- with my  own peer group, so 
that I had to learn English, but I think 
I could do most everything else. Math I 
certainly could do, and I lear
ned English so on enough. By  the end of the year I won 
the prize for the best student. So I didn™t do
 too badly. I work ed hard at my  studies 
because I had so much to catch up on. My distant relative played all kinds of tricks 
on me and made me say horrible things be
cause I didn't know wh at I was saying. 
And I got into a lot of trou
ble, but it sorted itself out. 
Q: Did you miss 
Germany
? Did you consider 
Germany
 your home at that point? 
A: I missed my friends, I missed my gran
dmothers. I don™t know that I missed the 
physical part of 
Germany
. I think at that age perhaps 
that™s not so important, but I 
certainly missed my friends. It was so much
 -- there was so much to learn and so  
much new, and so much to cat
ch up with. It -- the impres
sions came so hard and so 
fast and they were so different. Comi
ng from -- coming from a home, for example, 
as we were lucky enough to  have, with serv
ants and wh atnot to a one room that we 
stayed in. We had one room and that -- th
at was it. It w as a -- a new lifestyle, but 
you know, my  -- my  mo ther particularly
 was quite adventuresome. My father 
became very depressed. My father, who wa
s unable to find 
work because they 
wouldn™t let him work, was in
 a -- sort of a desperate situ ation and as the war years 
came along, it became even more
 so. Because 
remember, in 
Cana da, 
the war started

September the third, 1939. We were at wa
r exactly a year from the date we arrived 
in 
Ca na da
. My father tried to join the army
, they wouldn™t have him because he 
wasn™t a citizen. He wanted to join th
e medical corps, they wouldn™t have him 
because he wasn™t regi
stered as a medic in 
Ca na da
 and you couldn™t become a 
med ic in  
Ca na da
 until you took up c
itizenship. And so all -- everything was closed, 
and his main concern was trying to  ge
t the grandmothers over. And he had 
absolutely no lu ck in th at department. 
I know he traveled back and forth to  
Ottawa
 
trying to  persuade the powers that be, 
the natio -- the commissioner of refugees, a 

wonderful woman by th e name of Senator 
Karen Wilson
, to see if there was some 
way of getting the grandparents out,
 even if it would be over at the 
Dominican 
Republics
, or 
Cuba
, but even that door seemed to 
be closed because of their ages. 
And my father was making creams at that 
point and my  mo ther, 
fortunately got a job 
and work ed very hard . She 
fortunately met a p hysician through friends, I guess, or 
family, Canadian family, in 
Mo n trea l
, who was very interested
 in the fact that she 
was able to do physioth erapy, which was no
t done a wh ole lot on this side of the 
ocean. And she was very well trained and 
it was a period of the polio epidemic 
starting. And also, she did post-operative 
-- broken legs and th ings like that, she 
work ed with patients and so  on. And sh e r
eally had a lot of work. She -- she e -- 
well, in time she even -- we 
even got an ap artment that had a basement in it, a

finished basement in which she gave classe
s, gym classes, and then the rest of the 
apartment was rented out to different peop
le -- different rooms. And she -- she did 
very well and -- because my father coul
dn™t work . Bu t he was invited by Dr. 
Wilder 
Penn field 
and Dr. 
Cohen
 at the Neurological Institute in 
Montreal, 
which is a very 
well known place, to come on rounds and to
 hone his skills and to get the English 
lingo. And he did th at, and in time he me
t someone wh o asked him to become an 
intern in a hospital in 
the Maritime provinces of 
Cana da
, where the medical people 
left in order to join the 
army. So a place became availabl
e where they really needed 
his skills, and he -- he worked there un
til -- until someone said, why do you have 
this enemy alien working fo
r the Ca-Canad ian government? And he went through a 
horrible period of time in wh ich his life wa
s made miserable by th e powers that be 
because he was -- they c
onsidered him as an enemy alien who -- whom they 
suspected of being a farmer and a spy. He -- the Mounties came  to visit him one day 
and he said, take the cameras, because they
 were afraid that he was photographing 
installations on the shore -- o-o -- the seacoast of 
New Brunswick
, which was where 
his job was. He went to 
New Brunswick
 to take on the job, my  mo th er and I stayed 
in 
Montreal
 so that she could continue wo rkin
g. And as an intern, you know, it™s 
hardly enough to su pport a fa mily , so they -- we lived in 
separate places for awhile, 
for a number of years. But he ev en weathered that, and I came across some of the

clippings in the newspaper in getting ready 
to talk to you just the other day and I 
didn™t realize the splash that all this made in the newspapers across 
Canada
, that, 
you know, the government 
was employing en emy aliens 
to -- who were taking 
advantage and taking th e money fro
m our people. So  you come from 
Germany
, you 
come to 
Canada
 -- and of course, I was called a dirty Jew from 
Germany
 in  school 
in 
Ca na da
, where you know, the blinders were 
close to the head. And it was not an 
easy time in 
Ca na da
. It was not. 
Q: So how did you hand
le this? Coming from 
Germany
 and hearing th is in 
Canada
? 
A: With great difficulty. W
ith very, very great difficu
lty. But I did have Jewish 
friends in class, and I must say, I found 
-- I found my friends among Jewish kids. All 
-- practically only 
Jewish children in 
Montreal
. And we did not live in a Jewish 
section of 
Montreal
 at all. 
Q: Were -- were these other refugee 
children, or these were Canadians? 
A: In -- they were can -- my friends 
were Canadian friends, but my mother 
circulated with a group o-
of refugees because in 
Montreal
 they were quite a number 
and yes, she had -- well, she 
also had non -- she also ha
d Canadian friends, but many 
not -- many Jewish friends who, like ourselves came  over at one time or another.  
Q: What about the teachers in the school?

A: The teachers in general we
re absolutely wonderful. I ha
d never of -- I -- been so 
well received, and the principal of the school
 was really -- they were trying so  hard 
to make me  comfortable, and they  did. 
And I had a very  -- I had a happy time in 
Montreal
 in school -- well, you know, you al
ways have one teacher that™s may b e 
not so great. But I would say, generally sp
eaking, they were wonderful. And in the 
Maritimes they could not ha
ve been nicer. They were very accepting. Na -- but 
nobody ever asked me
 about wh ere I™m from or why 
I™m here. Nobody, even when I 
went to co llege, nobody ever brought 
up th e subject. An d with a name like 
Fischer
, 
y-ye -- and I had no accent, nobody even  su
spected. And it™s interesting in these last 
few years was the first time th
at my  college friends and my
 high school friends, with 
whom I™m still in touch, some
 of whom I™m still in touch,
 posed questions to me. I-I 
think they were afraid. They
 didn™t want to rub salt into
 wounds. I would have been 
very happy to talk. I think 
I would have. In -- in colle
ge I would have, but nobody 
ever asked, and I wouldn™t -- you know, I wo
uldn™t speak on my own. In fact, I™ve 
not spoken too mu ch , althou
gh I have with my childre

amount. Not everything.  

Q: Your -- your father was in 
the Maritime p rovinces, you were in 
Montreal

Montreal. 
Q: Did you go back and forth to  visit?

A: Well, no. In the summer, I was sent to 
camp and my mother 
went to visit my 
father. It was just too expensive. I -- I went to 
Y 
camp , and one summer I stayed 
with friends who invited me 
to stay with them while Mo
ther visited my father. And 
then other -- then I went to summer camp
. One summer, the first su mmer, I think it 
was the summer of ™39 -- the summer of ™39, my  mo ther and father were engaged to 
be camp doctor and nurse a
nd I was allowed to go along as addition. And I was a 
camper, and they were in charge of things 
and that gave us all a little vacation in the 
mountains. 

Q: Wa-Was this a Jew ish camp? 

A: Yes, Camp 
Hiawatha.
 Yes, it was a Jewis h  camp  an d my  mo th er met an d  was 
very, very  friendly with one of the counselo
rs there, and it was a lifelong friendship 
that continued til both of them
 really passed away. In fact, 
Sophie
 came and visited 
my  mo th er h e re wh en  my  mo th er 
was in the nine -- in her 90™s. 
Sophie
 was a bit 
younger. The 
So phie
 that I mention is interesting because she™s a poet -- was a poet, 
Sophie Yellen
, and was one of 
Canada™s
 outstanding poets. And si -- the friendship 
continued and a wonderful one it was. All happened in  
Hiawatha.

Germany
?

A: Well, that™s a very interesting question, 
because yes, they tried to have and th ey 
have letters to their mothers until the wa
r broke out, which was only a year. And 
after that, there was no more correspo
ndence. But when my
 father knew that 
somebody was going -- traveling from 
Montreal
 to the Maritime p rovinces, or from 
the Maritime provinces back to 
Montreal
, depending on where he was, he would 
always ask them would they mail a letter in 
the one stop that the train made in the 

United States
. And so yes, they got mail over to 
them, a-at least to let them know 
that things were going well for us, even thou
gh the only -- they 
could only write to 
the 
States
, and then  
States
 would send us the mail. So that
 -- that was very di -- that 
was traumatic. 
Q: Did you write to your grandparents? 
A: I don™t know that I did. I don™t know th at I did. I don™t think so . I think those little 

blue letters were very, ve
ry closely written upon and 
I think maybe I signed my 
name, but I don™t re -- I don™t recall writing to them. 
Q: Mm-hm. And then as the war proceeded 
in  the early, you kn
ow, early 40™s, did 
you as a child know what was happening?
 Wh at was your wo rld like during the war 
in 
Ca na da
? 
A: My world was totally cons
umed with the war. My fath
er used to keep a map on 
the wall and punch pins into
 where the Germans were, a
nd especially once the war

started, how the movements of the Germans 
were taking place, how the forces were 
progressing, both in to th e east zone towards
 Russia
, as well as out to -- through 
France
 and into 
Holland.
 And we would listen to news 
every night, of course, and 
as many times during the day 
as, you know, as there were
 news on, which wasn™t 
always our time. I mean, 
the news came on at seven o™clock and everybody was 
sitting around. And I think it was the most 
trying of times because my father was 
trying to  tell people in 
Canada
 wh at was happening and nobody listened. My  father 
brought out clippings from newspapers, Germ
an newspapers that he hid in slatted 
areas of his suitcases. He hid them in the lin
ings of the suitcases, to show the powers 
that be on this side of 
the ocean what was happening 
because nobody was listening 
and nobody wanted to  believe what was going
 on. Fortunately, he did not get caught, 
because when he was called one time to th
e police statio n -- and he was called many 
times -- he was very afraid 
that they might have found something because he was 
clipping, he was clipping news
paper articles right and left. 
Q: Clipping from which papers? 

A: Newspa -- the German newspapers. He wa
s taking sections out 
of newspapers to 
bring here to this side of the ocean -- 
Q: I see.

A: -- in order to tell people who were so
 unbelieving, of s -- things that were 
happening that didn™t make papers here, 
and people weren™t willing to listen. You 
know, when you read what 
Stev en Wise
 couldn™t even get through. Nobody 
listened, nobody. And nobody 
wanted to. They didn™t want
 to believe. So you asked 
-- I was -- I was totally consumed with 
the war. I would come in from school and 
listen. I listened. It was almo
st a way of life, wasn™t it? 
Q: Were -- were your fam -- was y our family aware of what was happening to the 
Jews specifically during the war? 
A: Oh, oh absolutely. Not -- 
well, they saw the beginnin
gs of it all when  people 
disappeared  and people just didn™t make it ba
ck from the police stat
ions or they were 
snatched out of their beds. 
I mean, that was happening all around. And it was 1938. 
Things were not at all tr
anquil, even -- even in 
Silesia
. I think there was much fear, 
there was much fear and there was the consta
nt hope that we could bring the mothers 
out.  
Q: What happened to  
your grandmother in 
Berlin

Berlin
 was in a round-up and was put on a train and died in

She had two children, my  mo ther and Uncle
 Ludz
 and 
Ludz 
was t h e younger of the 
two and he was smuggled out of 
Germany
 by his non-Jewish gi

to the 
States
 in ™39, the war had already started, and made it to 
Chicago
, and signed 
up almo st immediately for the army. And what 
I™m trying to find out
 at this point in 
time is whether he might have been  one of the 
Ritchie
 boys. The 
Ritchie
 boys, the 
German Jewish people who came over who 
became interpreters and who were sent 
back to 
Germany
 in  the army  to help with  language things. Because he did indeed 
go into the army and became an
 interpreter and stayed in 
Germany
 after the war had 
finished to help 
with the -- with translations for the 
Nuremberg 
Trials. But I don™t 
know. I™m trying to find out 
wh ether he might have been  a 
Ritchie
 boy because 
there™s been some interesting information. 
Ritchie
 boys, the camp that was started 
here in 
Mary la nd

Q: How did he get into the 
United States
 now, and you all couldn™t?

 mo th er™s side who declared him as being very  well

United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Renate Chernoff
. This is tape number three, 
side
 B.
 You were already in 
Ca na da  
wh en  
Kristallnacht 
happened in November 
™38. How did you hear about it? 
A: Well, I think we probabl
y learned about it through th
e radio, a-and of course 
knew at once that if synagogues we
re the targets, ours, both in 
Ratibor
 and in
 
Breslau
 were undoubtedly part of the pictur
e, and indeed  they were. I don™t know 
that we knew the particulars, but I do know 
that my father said, and they didn™t burn 
part of that synagogue because there were 
stores around the synagogue that were in 

hands of Germans, close to the wall around 
or near the synagogu
e. So part of the 
build ing was destroyed, and part of it was not. But the 
[indecipherable]
 synagogue, 
which is the one that my  parents and gr
andparent went in -- we-were in -- were 
members o f and where my grandparents ha
d pews, strangely enough next to each 
other, we know that that -- we knew that 
that synagogue was ba
dly damaged in part. 
And the pictures have borne
 that out. They™re in the process of restoring that 
synagogue at this point in time, but what I 
learned -- wh at we learned, and of course 
to the horror of everyone, oh we -- we le
arned thro ugh the radio and then also I

believe there mu st have been notification 
by mail as to what -- what was damaged. 
Interestingly enough, I think that my father
 and his mo ther probably had sort of an 
understanding of wh at was going to  be said in
 a -- in a code sort of way, as to the 
situation. 
Q: This was a code between the tw o of
 them so you wouldn™t understand? 
A: No, so that -- so -- all the 
letters were censored at that
 point and they did not want 
the censors to be aware. An
d I know that certain people™s names were mentioned, 
and never with a surname,
 and maybe with  Uncle
 John
 did su ch and such , and you 
kind of knew wh at was going on and I do 
remember the last letter th at my 
grandmother wrote. She wrote that she need
ed some tea, would we be able to send 
her some tea, and that was the last -- that
 was the last letter that we ever received 
from her. And in all the letters, 
it was a little bit up
beat, in I am very well, but -- or -- 
or I am very well, and then period, and th
en  could you possibly send me some tea. 
And we knew that that was a very bad sign. About 
Kristallnacht 
itself, other than 
hearing it, and of course my  parents just
 speechless with the news that was coming 
in, I still see us sitting around the radio, th
e whole family and really despairing.

I don™t think I ever did. And wh at can I 
say? I didn™t have a childhood. 
Q: Mm-hm. Any other experiences you 
can remember a b out during the wartime 
while you were in 
Canada
? I mean, you said your fath
er followed the progress of 
the war with the pins.  

A: Well, in our Canadian schools, a lot 
of English guest children came over and so 
we had many guest children in our classe
s. People who opted  to send th eir kids 
overseas until the end of the war. And 
I had a very, very dear friend, 
Monya 
Williams 
was her name and we stayed in touch 
for awhile after sh e went back home. 
And life in 
Canada
, as life was here was -- had rationing, we had a lo t of rationing. I 
think you probably had mo re ra
tioning th an we did, but it 
was as my mother always 
used to say, this isn™t rationing. She went
 through the first World War, and she said 
this was just equalizing things out. It wa
s, you know, very, very little rationing per 
se. Nobody ever went hungry
. And during the war -- a-as a child during the war I 
rolled bandages. I went down to  Red Cro
ss headquarters on Saturd ays and I helped 

served coffee. My mother al
so w-work ed fo r the Red Cro
ss at the -- at the blood 
donating centers. I work -- I -- 
I helped wh en  we had serv ice personnel come to the 

Jewish u -- like a 
USO

to the young soldiers who we
re coming through. And this was a little bit later on, 
this was when the soldiers were coming 
through the Maritime provinces to get on 
the ships to send them overseas. The Jewish la
ds had a place to come to to dance and 
to write letters and just to have a good tim
e, and we teenagers we
re allowed to help 
and that was always -- that was very nice. 
I had a job very early on. I tried to get a 
job in 
Montreal 
painting signs, but they
 th ought maybe 11 was too young to  get a jo 
-- to give anybody a job. Bu t I used to sometimes walk
 to Sunday school -- to 
Hebrew school. I did go to  Hebrew school in 
Montreal, 
we went to 
Shaar 
Hashomayim
, which is a very beautiful, large synagogue and I had Hebrew twice a 
week and I had Sunday school, but mo st of 
the time I either walked , or mo re than 
likely I took the tram, if I wasn™t 
lucky enough to get a ride in the 
Bronsman
 car. 
Now, the
 Bronsman
 kids, 
Charlie
 and 
Edgar
 were classmates of mine at 
Shaar 
Hashomayim
, and they  had a -- a driver wh o dr
ove them back and forth from class 
to Hebrew  school, and once in awhile we go
t rides with them, and that was very nice 
because they had chocolate m
ilk on the cars and the rest of
 us usually just got white 
milk. And my mother, as a ma
tter of fact, in her -- in her physiotherapy capacity 
massaged -- gave massages to Mrs. 
Bronsman
. And I remember very well in 
Montreal 
my  mo th er d i d  th e 
Bronsman
 job, I guess once a week and sh e would 
have to walk, because of co
urse she didn™t have a car and the streetcar or the bus

would only carry her so far, a
nd she would have to walk up 
Westmount.
 Now mind 
you, the 
Bronsmans
 lived up on the very 
top of the hill and there certainly wasn™t a 
-- a bus going up there. And so she ma
rched in the cold  of winter. And 
Montreal 
can be very icy in wintertime and she got such  chilblains, and I rememb er she came 
home, her legs were just so cold. I re
me mb er weeping and thinking how she was 
suffering. And I asked her about it a number of
 years back and I said, Mother, I used 
to cry so, because I was so unhappy that 
you had such hard work. And sh e said oh, 
she said, you know, I look b
ack on this and sh e said it 
was such a good time. It  was 
the only time in my life
, when we lived in 
Montreal, 
where I was an independent 
woman and where I carried the family on my 
shoulders, and she said that was very 
satisfying. I go -- I -- I™ve mulled that over many, many times, and indeed it was. 

She did wonderful work  in -- in
 her capacity as therapist.

think I could not. I still r
ecall exactly where these encoun
ters took place, and they 
were not in sight of the teachers, they we
re when we were ha
ving recess, either 
playing marbles, or downstairs. On very  co
ld days we were -- we were just mulling 
around and sitting on the 
benches and so on for -- for a 
little time out. And it wasn™t 
the boys as much as the girls that were 
nasty. But maybe girls are nastier to each 
other anyway. 

Q: Did you tell your parents about these incidents? 
A: Probably  not. I don™t know. Probably no
t, I think -- I think I just did not want 
them to worry about things
 more than they did. Th
ey had -- they had so many 
worries on their shoulders. 
My father, who couldn™t work
 and who wanted so  mu ch 
to wo rk. And y -- no -- you know, no mone
y coming in. My mo ther, who wo rked  so 
hard, and nothing in  the offing 
fo r my  father and that must have been , to the kind of 
person th at he was, a tremendous blow. A
nd -- howev er, he had a fantastic sense of 
humor all -- all his life, and I think maybe
 it even helped him 
then when
 things 
looked so  bleak. And I think the frustration 
that he carried within  him, having so  
much information, wanting to tell people -- 
he even was in touch with a writer from 
the newspaper who was the son of so
mebody who knew so
mebody, you know, 
closer, and not just the man on the street. 
And nobody wanting to believe. I think 
that must have been so frustrating.

Q: Mm-hm. Did you feel German at that point? Canadian, Jewish? How would you 
describe yourself during the war years in 
Ca na da
? 
A: Well, I didn™t feel Cana
dian, certainly not. Everything
 was very strange to me. I 
didn™t feel German. I guess I felt Jewish. 
And maybe not by choice, but I was made 
to feel Jewish. Not that, you know, not that  I wouldn™t say I was Jewish, but I think 

yes, I think I was made to feel Jew ish. 
I remember a sad thing. I was walking in 
front of a shop one day, looking at some
 baked goods in the bakery  store, I™d -- 
would feast my eyes on all these good, 
good things. And there was my father, I 
didn™t realize that he was in back of me, l
ooking at me -- so he tells me, and I™m sure 
it™s true -- with not enough 
chan ge in his pocket to b
uy me the little roll that I 
wanted, th at I would have liked to have ha
d. It -- I think, you 
know, these are su ch 
small things in the scheme of things, 
but such humiliating 
and -- and 
depressing 
reactions. I mean, I think of it often. I™m su
re he never thought of it that mu ch any 
more after the fact. He was a realist, it 
couldn™t happen at that point. I, on the other 
hand, internalized the whole thing. And -- yeah.  

Q: And so you made -- you 
continued to make friends 
though, when -- y-you were 
talking about during those times? 
A: Yes, I had -- I made friends, I had no 
trouble making friends. Made good friends. 
And then, of course, I was in 
Montreal 
only fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh -- four years

in 
Montreal
 and th en we moved to 
Saint John, New Brunswick
, where my father 
got the job as an intern, but 
we were not able to join 
him until the four years were 
over and h-he was able to get an apartm
ent and get enough money to support us, 
because my mother did not 
work after we came to 
Saint John. 
Q: And then how long did you stay there? 
A: And we stayed in 
Saint John --
 well, I was married in 
Saint John
. So I think my 
parents moved in 1955. My father got his c
itizenship in 19
45 or ™46, and then took 
his Dominion Council exams and passed his ex
ams so that he could go in to practice, 

which he did, and then he be -- he be
came a diabetic and had some physical 
problems and so  it was thought that he shou ld give up private practice and go into a 
hospital situation, which he did in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia
. And it was a psychiatric 
hospital there, and he was in charge of 
all the woman patients, I th ink, at that 
hospital. And he stayed there until he retired
 and he was -- that was ™78, I guess. So 
he was there quite a numb er of years and they  made a very happy life in 
Halifax
. 
Sa int Jo hn 
was a very small town, little in-bred. 
I mean, it was very small in every 
way. And moving to 
Halifax
 was really a nice thing for them to do because first of 
all it was a beautiful city and 
then it had the stimulation of
 having a university there. 

Two, as a matter -- th ree -- three universities,
 with a lot of cultu
ral things going in, 
which they loved. And th
ey got a house on the 
Dartmouth
 side of the -- of the city

and then they joined us. Wh
en my father -- when my fa
ther retired, he wanted to 
move Mo m and himself down to  
Knoxville,
 which they did. They  came and they 
joined us in 
Knoxville
 and were there a couple of years when  my  husband was 
called by the 
NIH
 to come and work here and to
 head  the department of blood 
diseases. And so  my  parents said
, well we™d like to go back to 
Halifax.
 With  heavy 
heart. They -- they did not
 want to come to the 
Washington
 area. So they moved 
back to 
Halifax
 and had many more good years in 
Halifax
 until my father died and 
then my mother did indeed co
me to visit -- I mean, come 
to stay with us, and that 
was good. 
Q: Let™s go back a little bit in time, to 
the end of the war. What was it like for you 
when the war was over?  

A: Oh, it was the most freei
ng, wonderful experience. I 
reme mb er b e ing  in  camp , 
and my  father sending me information about
 the victory, and all hell broke loose in 
camp. This was Canadian camp, you know
? And it was such a freeing -- it was like 
tearing away  ropes that bound one™s chest,
 really. And of course, with it came the 
realization that even th
ough the war was over, there were so many gone. I 

remember, for example, in th
e mi ddle of one night wh en my  mo ther woke us all up 
screaming. And this was in the 40™s, the ear
ly 40™s. And to  this day sh e thinks that 
was the day that her mother was killed. And 
-- and probably it was. Probably it was.

But the fact that the war was over was -- at
 least the European 
part of the war was 
over. This was not yet the end because -- 
but Canadian forces were not in the 
Pacific
. So in a way, for us that war was over.  
Q: During the war, during the latter parts of
 the war, did your family know anything 
about the camps, or did that co
me out only later for them? 
A: You know, I had the feeling that they
 did know about the camps because there 
were some camps that were alrea
dy in existence when we were in 
Germany
. 
Mauthausen
 for one, and 
Dach au
. So, I think they were 
very well aware of what 
was going on, and I don™t know, 
but they  kept in very  close touch with friends who 
had also emigrated, and when  one got, you
 know, word 
about anything, that they 
would sh are with the adults, not the -- not th
e children. And as I say, for many years 
my father tried so desperately to get th
e grandmothers out, and would go to the 
States 
in order to do some of his work. I mean, up to 
Ottawa, 
down here to this 
area. But there was -- there was no way. 
Q: Mm-hm. So the war is over, did the camp 
celebrate at all, or did you celebrate in 
any specific way? Wa
s it a Jewish camp? 
A: No. No, I don™t think there was a celebr
ation. I can™t -- I can™t -- I can™t -- I don™t 
know.  
Q: And you were 16 then?

A: Yeah. Ah -- 
Q: In 1945. 

A: Yeah, I w -- yeah, right. 
Q: And then what happened, just ge
nerally with your life, from 16 on? 
A: Well, I™ll tell you a wonderful thing that 
happened. After all -- after the war was 
over, my parents wanted to adopt a child from a 
DP
 camp. And indeed they did. Our 
darling 
Saul
 came to us -- my fath er had wanted
 to have a son, a boy come. He 
didn™t have a boy of his own, I think, and 
he probably  thought it was best not to have 
another girl. So arrangements were made 
through the Canadian -- mm, I can™t think 
of the organization, but it was a refugee organization, and in time 
Saul
 arrived with 
a number of other children who were brought to 
Cana da
, for whom homes were 
found, and he came to live with us. And he 
came, I was away in college already and 
when I came home from college, here was this 
new addition to the family. Well, as it 
turned out, he was with us 
for awhile, and wh en he gain -- when he realized the kind 
of person Mom and Dad were, 
he said, you know, I really have a mother, but I was 
afraid -- a -- a blood mother who survived 
-- and -- but I want -- I needed to get -- I 

wanted to  get out and the only way to get 
out was to declare myself as an orphan, 
which is how he got into 
Ca na da
, and -- 
Q: How old was he and where was he from? 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

86
A: He was from 
Poland
, I re -- I d on™t know the name 
of the town. I think I can look 
it up, but I don™t know the name of the 
town . And his mother and one sister 
survived. The rest of his fam
ily, his father and his other brothers and sisters did not, 
but these two surv ived . And of course as 
soon as my  father heard th at there was 
blood kin, he did his 
level best to get them out and 
-- and did. And, as a matter of 
fact, next week I am going to
 Los Angeles
 to be present at the 
Bar Mitzvah
 of his 
grandson. And we have 
kept in close touch.
 Saul 
stayed with my family for a 
number of years, went to high school in 
Saint John,
 stayed with Mo m and Dad and 
then decided he would like to go to 
Mo n t real 
where there were more Jewish kids. 
And he became a typesetter and type -- was 
able to do typesetting in English and 
Fren-French and in Yiddish . And then got a job in  
Lo s Ang e les
 and took his mo ther 
and sister t o  
Lo s Angeles
, and that™s where he is today. He married a girl from 
Pola nd , 
from his village, and as I say, we™re going to see them next week. They 
have come to all our
 simchas
, we have tried to be at theirs. And it™s a very happy 
and wonderful relationship. It™s -- it™s a di
fferent sort o -- probably not like a kin -- 
an -- a blood kin relationship, but it™s a 
wonderful relationship.
 And there isn™t a 
week that goes by th at we don™t talk. And he
™s a lot of health issues with his wife 
over the last six months and I think I 
talked to him every other day. And -- 
Q: HoHo -w old was he wh en he came to your family?

I think th is work ed out very well. 
Q: What was his last name -- what is his last name? 

A: 
Saul
 
S-Silvershein -- Silvershein
, but he changed it to 
Saul Silver. 
Q: Yeah. So you finished hi
gh school, you went on to 
college, where did you go to 
college? 
A: I went to college in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia
, 
Dalhousie 
University and I studied 
chemistry. Not by choice, I wanted to go 
to art school, but my  parents wouldn™t let 
me go to art school, I had to do something pr
actical with which I could earn my  keep  
and preferably not something th at require
d a ch ange of language. And being the 
good daughter that I was, I did not fight th
e thing, this was ordained, my father had 
said so, and I did it. I went to college, 
I did well in school, and ended up going to 
graduate school at the Univ ersity of
 Chicago
 in microbiology, fo r which the 
province paid. Then I -- but 
then  I met my  husband and 
that™s the tale. I met my 
husband while I was at the University of 
Chicago
, at international house. I w -- I, as 
an international student and he as a good 
representative of American-hood. He was 
in a residency at 
Michael Reese
 Hosp ital in 
Chicago
. And it was love at first sight 
and we got married in 1953 in 
Sa int Jo hn, New Brunswick,

where he finished his residency 
and our first child was born in 
Sain t Louis, David.
 And then we moved to  
Durha m , 
North Caro lina
 where he was at 
Duke
 and 
Susan 
was born. And th en we moved to 
Knoxville, Tennessee,
 where he headed a research
 unit of the University of 
Tennessee 
and 
Judy
 was born, and then we didn™t
 move any more, until we moved 
here. It was too late then. 
Q: Whe-Wh en did you move to the 
Washington 
area? 
A: About 20 years ago, which would 
have been -- well, 25 almo st, 1980.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: 1980. And our kids went on to
 make good lives for themselves. 
David

 Susan

Judy,
 who is a physician, lives in

Q: So you -- 
A: -- we did not go. I have not been back, 
not ever been back. I shouldn™t say that. I

Amos

Beginn ing Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection with 
Renate Chernoff.
 This is tape number four, side
 A. 
Let™s 
now talk about some of your thoughts a
nd feelings about what you went through. 
You said before that your mother had said
 you really didn™t have a ch ildhood. Do 
you agree with her? 
A: I do. And I™ll tell y ou, to this day, though 
I have a large circle of friends, I am still 
an outsider. I still f
eel my self as removed from others
. Not that there -- not that I 
don™t have friends, I have plenty of frie
nds, but I™m still the one who™s looking in. 
And some days I find this rath
er discourag ing. I think -- I think that in my  artwork, a 
lot of it has dealt with Holo
caust and Holocaust issues, 
and even there I feel as 
though there is a layer be
tween me, my work -- me a
nd my  -- and friends, and I 

don™t know how else to explain it. 

Q: Do you feel in a sense that you are lik
e -- you are two people, one person on the 
inside and one person on th e outside? 

A: I guess so, because most people think I™m 
rather a jolly person, that I am full of 
fun and games and beans. And I can be that
 person, but I -- I™m 
not that person. I™m 
really reserved and I am withdrawn at times
. I get very easily depressed, and I have 
kept a journal of some of my  thoughts, no
t -- not often, but there are times. I have

91
insomn ia. And I have the dreadful need -- 
and I say dreadful because I dread it, I 
guess, I have to read every scrap of Ho
locaust literature I ca
n put my hands on. 
Whether I can find an adequate answer to so
mething, or when  I look at broadcasts 
on th e television, I™m looking fo r those peop
le that are no longer in my  life. I look 
for my  grandmothers everywhere and I ke
ep saying so metime I™m g o ing to see them 
again. And I busy my self in -- in a quiet 
way, with many of the questions of th e 
Holocaust. And I™ve tried to 
read not only people who 
-- work  of people who have 
gone through it, but of aut
horities who have written about 
it, and studies that have 
been -- psychological studies that have been
 done. I guess I™m trying to answ er, who 
am I. And -- and it all has made me what I 
am today, I guess, but I™d like to know, 
you know, why. I often say oh
, if life had been different and if I had -- if this had 
happened  and if that had happened. Bu t ever
ybody says that. You d
on™t have to be in 
-- in ma -- in my shoes or
 anybody else™s shoes, everybody asks that. But I 
sometimes think my  life would have been so
 different if times had been -- in th -- 
had run in  a normal way and I had grown up in 
Germany
 and gone to school in 
Germany
. Maybe it wouldn™t have been as intere
sting at this point
 in time, but it 
would have been very  different. 
Q: You had said that you went back to
 Germany
 and visited your aunt, but that™s all 
you did. Why did y
ou not see mo re of 
Germany
?

A: Well, for one thing we 
only had a few days in 
Berlin
, being practical about this. 
Amos 
was asked to give a lectur
e and we went and we cam
e back. I think I wasn™t 
ready to go back and I don™t 
believe it was easy to get to 
Breslau
 at that point in 
time. 
Berlin
 was open, 
Breslau 
o -- I don™t think was a tourist place -- tourist -- not 
that it needed to be a tourist place, but I 
don™t think it was a place th at wa -- I -- I -- 
we di -- we didn™t do it. I -- I -- I wish 
I -- I wish I could tell you more, but we 
didn™t, and it was a ma -- it was really a fact
or of time, and of f
ear, and of fear. You 
know, you want to go back 
and you don™t want to go 
back. We™ve gone back  to 
places where we had visited. We lived in 
Thailand
 fo r awhile and went back  30 
years later and were so sorry
 as to wh at had happened  
to the country. I like to 
reme mb er it the way it was 30 years ago. 
Now, everything that I remember -- not 
everything, but things that I reme mb er in the -- in 
Germany
 at the countryside, and 
meadows and -- and the beautiful winters and 
so on, they™re still 
there. The h -- th-
the houses and the buildings in my mind ar
e still the ones that are there, they™re not 
there any more. That area was terribly shot 
up, particularly the 
Russians took their 
guns to that area. And I don™t -- perhaps 
didn™t know or didn™t want to know what 
had really happened. Although some of my
 friends have gone 
back. My friend in 
Israel 
has gone back several times. But, inte
restingly enough, she is a year older 
than I am and couldn™t reme
mb er a thing. And yet, I™m

. But I -- I think I™m ready to go back 
now. I would like to be well and go ne
xt year, and we™re talking about it. 
Q: What was it like though, wh en you pu
t your foot down on 
German soil again, 
w h en  you  w e n t  b a ck ? 
A: I did not like it and I did not tell anybody
 that I could unders
tand what they were 
saying, because I could. I 
did not speak German, I spok
e only in English. And it™s 
very interesting when a German talks Germ
an to me, I question in my  mind, where 
were you and where was your family? Take 
an  example. My next door neighbor a 
few years ago was a couple. He was from 
Germany
, he was a writer for the 
Frankfurter Allgemeine
, wonderful German, conserva
tive German newspaper, a 
good newspaper, though. He was married to 
a Spanish gal and they lived next door 
and it took me at least half a 
year before I could be comfortable with him. They  had 
since become perhaps our closest friends
 and neighbors. They -- you know, if 
anybody could make me feel that maybe 
the younger generation 
today is different, 
he was the one. I am still in touch with them, 
they have moved back 
to -- well, at this 
point to 
Spa in.
 He still is writing for the 
Frankfurter Allgemeine
. I watched their 
daughter grow up, I babysat w
ith the daughter. I have a li
ttle plant here that™s my 
little 
Laura
 plant because she gave it 
to me. They are -- he is such a dear person and

people in this world. And I hope -- I hope
 that the young people today are like him 
because he™s an incredib
le person, maybe one of our best friends. So

Q: Did you tell him about
 your experiences?

he was also -- he was the first writer who 
wrote anything about the memorial -- the 
me mo rials, th e  Ho lo cau st memo rial s in  
Florida

 anything that bring back the experience

estones, feet on cobblestones, yeah. 
Q: Do you think in German? 
A: I count in German, I do my sums in Ge
rman. I™m not very good at using a little 
machine, so I -- I do all my math in Ge
rman. I read German, I -- I would say I™m 
fluent in every day German. I read slowly, 
stuff that™s a little 
bit more complicated, 
because after all, I kind of stoppe
d talking German when I came to 
Canada
 and my 
parents wanted to improve their English, 
so of course I had spoke English to  my  
parents. But -- but I did speak German, 
and -- when I went home, Mother and I 
always did try to keep it up 
at least a little. But I feel 
comfortable speaking German 
ma -- if I know who I™m talking to. Othe
rw ise I don™t open my  mo uth and let on. 
Q: Why not?

A: I don™t like to think -- I don™t li -- th-there is a sound in  the German language 
when I sometime hear people
 speak, that rarely ther
e is a brashness about the 
language that bothers me. If I know that they
 are German Germans, I-I just -- I d on™t 
react. I can listen and know exactly what 
they™re talking about. But there is a 
manner, there is a brusqueness ab -- the Germ
an tongue in some -- 
some people that 
I find a little difficult to take.  

Q: When your -- when your children were 
the ages -- the age that you were, seven, 
eight, nine, when  you were going 
through those difficult times in 
Europe
, did that 
bring back  th -- your childhood 
experiences even mo re vividly? 
A: I guess I was -- I was a tougher mother 
probably, than I ne
eded to be. I was 
probably a more careful
 mother, in many respects a stri
cter mother. My children tells 
-- tell me th at I was fairly strict. B u t I gue
ss the -- the inclination is to -- to now let 
anything happen, to be careful, to not see 
them hurt, as I was.
 They had very good 
rapport with each other and with their co
horts and I think th
ey had very happy 
childhood and very often I was just peek
ing in. I™m not sure I answered your 
question very well. Pose 
it to me again, please. 
Q: I -- I was just thinking, 
when your children were the 
same age, when they were 
seven, eight and nine, when  you were
 going through these difficult times in 
Europe
,

did you look at them and di
d it make you th ink of your age -- what you went through 
at that time? When -- 
A: Yes, I think particularly with the -- with
 the two girls. Not so
 mu ch  with  my  so n .  
I could identify less with him, of course. But yes, I -- I g u ess I -- I d id, I -- I did think 

-- I did think so often how fo rtunate, how 
fortunate they were 
to be born in this 
country and to live in this
 wonderful, wonderful country, of which I became a 

citizen, not too long ago. I did not -- I wa
s a C anadian citizen for a long period of 
time and then when I started to critique th
e government, I was told I better take out 
citizenship. You cannot criticize -- well, 
the story was ma -- 
my husband needed 
Q
 
clearance for his work, and so ah -- I -- I 
did take out my citizenship and it was a 
very formal thing in 
Knoxville,
 
Tennessee
 in the old-fashioned way and it was 
wonderful. It was a day to remember. And my  children were there and they were just 

sorry I couldn™t become 
the president of the 
United States
, that™s all. 
Q: Did you tell your children as they we
re growing up, about your background? 
A: You know, it -- it™s interesting, I did and I didn™t. I think I -- I was hesitant until 

they asked questions and th en when they
 asked questions I tried to answer as 

truthfully  as I could. On  the other hand 
they , like I, did not want to rub, you know, 
salt into any wounds. They did 
not want to put me into a 
situation that would make it 
hard on me, as I did to my  mo ther, because 
I did not want to hurt her. I -- I did share 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

June 23, 2005

with them, especially the school experiences.
 I di -- I shielded them, I think, a great 
deal as to what happened to
 the grandmothers. I just --
 I couldn™t talk about it and 
obviously th ey couldn™t either. But we
 watched together many offerings on 
television which prompted questioning, and I 
was tra -- I tried to answer as best I 
could, wh at I thought was appropriate for th
eir ages. So in a way I did share. But I 
think -- I think now -- I think now that mo
re is being written 
and more is known. 
The children today -- I mean, my -- my gr
own children today feel freer to ask me 
and I am able to answer them, perhaps a 
little bit better than be
fore. And even my 
grandchildren have asked me
 questions and I™m very willing to answer. And my 
grandchildren range in  age fro
m 13 to 17. So I have a go
od range there, and they  -- 
the thi -- the youngest one, who has just tu
rned 13, is the only one who has not yet 
been really exposed to
 things. But were he to ask, I 
would certainly be able to -- to 
answer, I think. 
Q: Are you angry that you had to go th rou
gh and your family ha
d to go through and 
pay the price that it did and people liv
ing in  this country  didn™t have to? 

A: Sometimes. But you know, on the other hand
, I am so grateful that things turned  
out relatively well for our family. And they  did. I sometimes am very angry th at the 
world didn™t respond. On th e other hand, we 
were so lucky and I feel so blessed that 
I have come -- I™m mu ch less angry now than
 I was at one time, and I think th at in

my  early adult years, I was very angry. 
But I think, as I™m getting older I™m -- I™m 
seeing it perhaps more in perspective. An
d I think the -- who in th e world would 
have known, or would have
 believed what was happening? I mean, the whole thing 
is so in-inconceivable. That™s why I th
ink I -- I-I -- I am much more aware and -- 
and worried  about places like
 Darfur, 
because again the world is silent. But not 
quite as silent as they were  then because we were inocul
ated at that point with a -- 
with a virus, if you will. So I cannot -- yo
u know, I -- I™m far less angry now than I 
was.  
Q: Were you involved in a
ny way in the civil rights mo
vement because you came 
from a country that deprived  many people of
 their civil rights, 
did you respond to 
that?  

A: I was very involved in the ci
vil rights movement. We lived in 
Knoxville, 
Tennessee
 and we lived there during th e marche
s, and we lived th
ere during the sit-
ins and we lived there during th e non-mixing 
of the races, and I was very involved. I 
took part in sit-ins in the south when it wa
sn™t exactly a picnic to do that. And I was 
one of the very, very  few white people who 
became a counselor at a black -- a mixed 
-- well, it w as not mixed, it was a black ca
mp , and I was maybe one of the few white 
people wh o, during those times went and taug
ht at a camp when I was thr -- we were 
threatened. The camp was thr
eatened because it had some 
black and whites togeth er.

But I felt strongly en ough -- 
in fact, I felt so strongly about going to  that camp, my  
little 
Judy
 was 18 months old and I took her in her 
stroller to that camp. I felt that if 
-- you know, maybe we didn™t have the mone
y with which to -- to -- to give large 
donations, I felt my  place was to do the righ
t thing, and so I -- it was very close to 
that movement and we always had friends
 who were -- black fri
ends who came to 
our house and with whom we
, you know, work ed togethe
r. My husband was the first 
one who gave a black person a 
job at the University of 
Tennessee
 Memorial 
Research Center. Yes, we were ve
ry involved, always have been. 
Q: Do you think that™s b
ecause of your history? 
A: I think so . It™s also because we™re Jewi
sh. That™s -- that™s our religion, and we 
have to live it. And that 
was one way of doing it. 
Q: Which was going to  be my  next questi
on about wh at your 
thoughts are about 
being Jewish, after all your family suffere
d because -- and you di
d too, because you 
were Jewish, I was just wondering what
 your thoughts on that subject was.  
A: More Jewish than ever. No
t necessarily in the religious
 sense, but in the way of 
life sense of doing the right thing and s
upporting the right causes. And helping 
where help is needed and living the exempl
ary life that our religion teaches us to 
live. And you know, whether I go to sh 
-- s -- Shabbat servic
es every Saturday, 
that™s not my thing. I go, I do gis -- I -- I go to 
Yizker
 services and I go to the high 

 
Interv iew with Rena te
 Fischer Chernoff

101
holid ay services, and I do go to  Sabbath serv
ices. But to me it™s
 the -- it™s the every 
day life. And I -- I hope I have instilled th
at in my children, 
because one of my 
children wo rked  for the brown lung situa
tion, has worked  in the mountains of 
A p p a la ch ia
, doing good work. And they™ve 
taken synagogue activities very 
seriously, but not the -- maybe not the little 
things, but in help
ing the homeless and 
that sort of a thing, so I 
think they™re instilled hopefull
y with -- with that -- those 
thoughts in mind. Am I more
 religious? Well, it depends wh
at you call religious. I li 
-- I live my  life in the best wa
y I know how to. I serve on the 
Hevre Kadisha
 at my 
synagogue. I did a lot of volunteer work
 when  I was younge
r. I taught Sunday 
school, all that good stuff. Going to sy
nagogue, depends. I like to think that 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So being discriminated because you we
re Jewish, and losing relatives who were 
close to you because you were Jewish has 
not negated any of you
r feelings about it? 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t think so . I 
don™t think so. I would say it may have 
reinforced the doing of the right thing at a
ll times and be it in very simple and easy 
ways of doing th e right thi
ng or -- or making mo re diffi
cult decisions. It has not 
negated it. I know many people left their 
religions on the other side of the ocean 
when  they  came over. I was not one of those.

Q: Let™s talk a little -- just more
 about some history. When the 
Eichmann
 trial was 
going on in 
Jerusalem
, what were your thoughts at that time? 
A: Get the bastard. I don™t know, at that
 point I probably was in a way seeking 
revenge. I -- I really can™t -- I can™t reme
mber how I felt at the time. I watched it 
diligently and I felt that 
Israel
 came up with the right answer. Of killing him.

Q: If you -- if you hadn™t gone thro ugh wh
at you did go throug
h, do you think you 
would be a different 
person? Are you -- 
A: Oh, absolutely. 
Q: In what way are you the person you ar
e today, attributed to your history? 
A: I think if I had lived in 
Germany
 and brought -- had been  brought up in  
Germany
, I would have had a -- a mu ch mo re 
superficial kind of life. I think I 
would have been a pamp ered daughter, ce
rtainly a pampered granddaughter. I was 
the only granddaughter on both sides, and th
e apple, I guess, of ma ny ey es and I 
think my  life would have been 
very different. I don™t know 
that I would have gone to 
university, I probably  wouldn
™t. I probably  would have done something mu ch  mo re 
frivolous. I™m not -- well, I don™t know, but 
I™m not so sure that causes would had

stirred me so, as -- well certainly the civ
il rights cause did, but there were so many 
other causes that, you know, that my  husband  and I were associated with. And he 
comes from a very, very stro
ng Zionist background and his father was a rabbi. I™m 
sure 
Aba Ch ernoff
 thought his son married out of the faith, but -- I don™t keep  a 
kosher house and that sort of thing, bu
t I think -- and you know. I-I don™t know, I 
think I would have been  a -- a pamp ered girl in 
Germany
. Maybe not, but you 
know, this is speculation and life is life a
nd I am just -- you know, I am so grateful, 
there isn™t a day that I don™t thank the f act that I™m here and that I™ve got four

u had mentioned the 
Holo caust before, and so if you could expand on that? 
A: Well, I -- I was a frustrated art stude
nt when I was studying microbiology and 
really all my life wanted to
 go to art school. Wasn™t a
llowed to because of other

104
matters. However, finally, after my childre
n stayed in school til 3:30 in the 
afternoon, my  husband urged me to do wh at
 I™ve always wanted to  do and th at was 
to go to art school, which I did. I we
nt to school at the University of 
Tennessee
 in 
Knoxville
. And first I -- he had had a -- a second
 heart attack at that point in our 
story and I again thought well, I should go 
back to school and learn to do something 
that would prepare me to earn a living, 
God fo rbid , and thought I would study art 
education. However, after the second class of
 art education I decided that was not fo r 
me under any circumstances. Perhaps I s
hould try the art school. And he wanted  
very mu ch  to have me do th at and so
 I did go to art sc
hool and I studied 
metalworking. And I -- I learned how to  s 
-- do metalsmithing, metalcasting and all 
aspects of the metal as an a -- as a tool, an
d taking a Master™s degree in Fine Arts at 
the university. And worked in metals and al
so had to ch oose a second part and that 
was fibers, and so I took metals an d fibers 
both, and then interes
ting situation arrived 
in the sense that after two years I was to
ld -- and I was work ing part time because I 
still had the carpools and th e ki
ds and 18 puppies and all th
at sort of thing -- I was 
told I had to choose a thesis project. And 
so I decided I would wr
ite a thesis o n  the 
history of the ceremonial objects pertaini
ng to the Torah and make contemporary 
pieces based on the research of the historyof each of these as implements on their 
own. And th at™s what I did. So  I made breastplates and I made 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interv iew with Rena te
 Fischer Chernoff 
June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
105
pointers, and I proposed the 
[indecipherable]
 and I made the covering fo r the 
Torahs and I made 
mezuzahs 
and all sorts of other thin
gs along the side, learning 
the technique. But I wanted 
to do something th at was a b
it cerebral as well as doing -
- creating something new, and so that I did.
 And I wrote a thesis
, a thick book, which 
-- the work of wh ich I enjoyed tremendo
usly, both doing the library re-research, 
which was a little difficult from 
Knoxville, Tennessee, 
but the university got me all 
kinds of books that I needed to and I was ab
le to do th at and in my  graduate show I 
showed my pieces, and it was accepted an
d I was a happy camper. I graduated in 
1973 with all my dear one
s around me. Cap and gown  and th e whole thing, and 
David
 graduated from high school
. So we had a gala celeb
ration together. And then 
we left 
Knoxville
 and I had -- I had the use of the 
university lab to 
do my work in 
and then we came to 
Knoxville
 and I no longer had a lab to
 wo rk in and so  I decided 
perhaps it was time to switch 
from doing metalwork, wh ich required gas, which I 
find very hard to -- to keep
 in my  house, which psychologically was very difficult 
for me to have a gas tank in  my  house. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Because of -- because of memo ries or
 thoughts about gas. 
I decided I would go 
ahead and carry on with
 weaving, which I loved, and 
I did tapestry weaving on -- I 
have a loom and I used the loom for vari ous tapestry projects. But all along I still 

 
Interv iew with Rena te
 Fischer Chernoff 
June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
106
loved my metal. And so, in the l-last num
ber of years I™ve comb ined  the two and I 
weave metal on my loom. And it™s wire that 
I use, and I use stainless steel wire and 
copper wire and brass wire and I weave it 
on my  loom and I do 
sculptural pieces. 
Many of them are Judaic. I take really my
 inspiration from the jew -- things Judaic. 
And of course, I have concentrated both 
on the liturgy -- I™ve done a series on the 
High Ho ly Day prayers, but I™ve also done 
Ho locaust series and I did one particular 
six piece Holocaust -- progression of thou
ghts on the Holocaust from the earliest 
days to the final days. And so -- and also
 my  metal,  my  wov e
n metal -- metal pieces 
are 
[indecipherable]
 boxes and things that could -- th
at could be used in wo rship or 
in home worship at least. I made mis -- 
mizrahs
 and the -- various other implements 
where I can use the wos -- woven fi -- the w
oven fabric made out of metal. And the 
comb ination of the technique of the loom 
plus the material of the metalsmith has 
given me a great deal of satisfaction, an
d I still continue working, very much 
influenced  by my  Judaic background, 
and very happy doing what I™m doing. 
Q: Can you describe your -- your six pa
nel wo rk th at you did relating to  the 
Holocaust in a little more detail? 
A: Okay. I called it ﬁ
Never Again
ﬂ and it is really a -- a gr
oup. It™s made up of six 
individual pieces and you™ll s
ee a lot of symbolism in this, o-of course. It -- it™s a 
progression of the events that occurred fro
m the beginnings, relating increasingly to 

 
Interv iew with Rena te
 Fischer Chernoff 
June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
107
the restrictive things, of the ims -- restric
tive laws of the Nazi regime in the 30™s. 
The second panel details 
Kristallnacht 
using my  synagogue as a -- part of the 
synagogue as my emp h asis. The third is ba
dges, reminding us of the oppressive acts 
of the Nazis when they tried to cleanse th
e country of undesirables. Incarceration, a 
progression for the confinement, enclosure 
and last journeys. The rapid escalation to  
-- to convey to and remove 
prisoners from the camps. I thi
nk one of the ideas that I 
used o-on the side, there™s a progression fro
m one to six, I used the stripes of the 
tallid
, progressing from one to six. I chose 
six because of the reference to six 
million. My last piece is a very dark one, 
but it has a little gli
mmer of gold, and that 
is our hope for the future, 
that these things never ha
ppen again. They™re small 
tapestries. I wanted them sma
ll so that one has to lean in
to them in order to really 
study them, more like putting 
one™s nose into a book, if you will, by coming thr -- 
into very  close contact. I used cotton 
material because it was a non-precious 
material. I felt that I w anted
 to use something rather un
iversal and simple and there 
are -- there are many references to numbers 
and to colo rs and to th e stripes on the 
prisoners garb. And the colors of the -- 
the badges, wh ich represented different 
factions, not only Jews, but people in gene
ral who were incarcerated. It™s a series 
that I did not start with piece number one, strangely enough, piece number five was 
the first one I did, and then kind of wove
. I knew I wanted to do six pieces, but 

 
Interv iew with Rena te
 Fischer Chernoff 
June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
108
started with number five and then  went 
backwards and started to numb er one. The 
first one has a few let -- letters in it, and it says 
Jude Raus
, but if you™ll see the 
d-e
 
and the 
u-s
 is 
Deus
, and my  question is wh ere was 
Deus
, where was God then ? It 
was a ma mmoth undertaking psyc
hologically for me to do this piece, but I hope that 
the children will look on it so
metime and remember what happened to all of us. 
Q: Have you been  to the Holocaust Muse
um, or any other Holocaust mu seum or 
Yad Vashem
? 
A: I have been to 
Ya d Va shem
 and I™ve been to the 
Holocaust Museum in 
Washin gton
 many, many times. I go frequently. I f
eel privileged in 
the fact that I 
can go and read names on 
Yom HaShoah
. I take every visitor that comes to visit me 
here in 
Washington
 to the museum. I find it an e-extremely uplifting as well as the 
other extreme. I feel both buoyed by th e ex
perience and I feel very sad and -- and -- 
and live it again and again but I feel someti
mes it™s important to go and just be there 
and see maybe just one or two of the exhi
bits, or go to the library and do a little 
research on subject matter that™s v ery dear 
to your heart. And I -- as I say, I go very 
frequently . I go to th e bookshop, I find very
 wonderful books th
ere to -- to take 
home. And I find it an -- perhaps the mo st unusual place to visit in 
Washin gton 
and 
I tell every one of my  vis
itors they mustn™t leave 
Washington 
with out going and 
they will be well rewarded in different wa
ys by going. I think that the teaching 

 
Interv iew with Rena te

June 23, 2005 
 

 
 
109
programs there are just remarkable. I love 
the fact that so many of the teaching is 
done, not only teaching children, but teach ing the police force that comes through 
the gates, the teachers. I like the spirit of 
the workers there, who are just remark able 
people who -- I can™t say enough for it. I th
ink we are just so blessed to have the 
mu seum here. And have I been
 to others? I™ve been to 
Ya d Va shem
 and I will 
probably go to the 
Wiesenthal 
Center when  I go to 
Los Angeles 
next week. 
Q: In closing, is there anything else th
at we haven™t talked about, or any message 
you wanted to give to your children or
 your grandchildren, before we close? 
A: Learn well the lesson, as the great ph
