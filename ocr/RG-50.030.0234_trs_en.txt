Who knows when we'll me t, where we'll meet
 and who we 'll meet, and these was very, 
very meaningful, especially to me  and not only 
to me, so I went back to Lithuania at that 
time and uh when I came  to Lithuania, it was 
1939.  The Congress in August and the next 
June 1940, the Soviets occupied Lithuania and wh
en the Soviets occupied Lithuania, so I

ungest delegate, and nevertheless we 
were the the general Zionist Youth Moveme nt

Soviets occupied Lithuania, they took unde
r arrest the the lead
ers of the Zionist

Weizma n against the Soviet Un

 my innocence and I laughed 
when...when I laughed I got imme diately smack
ed in the face.  
While I'm laughing...you 
should answer when you're being questione
d, so I said I don't even know Professor 
Weizma n, s o he says you are lying like a 
dog.  That is an expr
ession... expression in

Russian, ______________.  You are lying like a

World Gathering of Zionists.  Professor We iz
man was the pr esident of the Gathering and 
you say that you don't know We iz ma n.  
____,  ___, ____.  So I said everybody knows 
Weizma n, Professor We izma n, but Professor We izma n to this very day doesn't know that 
there exists such a ma n by the name  of Av
raha m _____.  But it it didn't help.  I should 
disclose to them what plans of destructiondid I have with Professor We izma n against the 

Soviet Union.  We ll this is to  show
 you only one second.  
I as a Zionist and 
professor...my my patron, my fa mous a
nd beloved patron, Professor Sigmung Belaski 
(ph) who was a fa mous professor at 
the University of _________, which is now 

_________, after the first revolution, he run away from from ____ and he came to 

Kovno, Lithuania and there he was admitted as 
a professor of civil law although he was a 
Jew, although he didn't speak Lithuanian at 
all, but he was world famous and he wrote 
several monumental books on the 
civil war in uh in copyright
 and so on, and I was lucky 
enough to write my thesis, my...you know...wha
t you call it in other languages, the 
doctorate, I wrote with Pr ofessor Belaski, 
and when I...when I passed all the exams and 
uh I was waiting for the evaluation of my thes
is that they submitted to Professor Belaski 
and then I wa s invited at his...at his law offi
ces and then he asks me  what do you want to 
do with yourself when you graduate law?   I said
 Pr ofessor, I wa nt to be a lawyer.  You 
know what does it mean to be a lawyer.  It 
means...a lawyer means to be twenty-four 
hours a day a lawyer.  So said Professor, how 
could it be?   Even a lawyer has to sleep a 

little.  Yes.  This is exactly
 what I wanted to tell you, 
that in your dreams, you dream 
about the mi stakes you've done this day and don't 
repeat it the next day.  This is a lawyer, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234

and when I...several time s he asked me  a
nd you know and it is very difficult.  It's  
very...so he said are you sure you wa
nt to be lawyer.  I said yes, Professor.  But I wanted 
to know what is the result of my...of my thesis. 
 I didn't know it yet.  So then he takes out 
from his drawer my thes is, and he hands it 
over and I see there was 
written excellent and 
I (laughing) reme mber the thesis was _____ 
and _____ in the Roma n and Russian Wa r.  
(Laughter) It was in 1933.  So then he sa
ys are you sure you want to be lawyer.  
Tomorrow come  to my office and you'll work w
ith me , and this was in 19...by the end of 
1933 because in order to work as a lawyer, you 
had to to have  six months preparatory in 
the court, but then in '39, the Lithuanian mi ni
ster of justice, he was not...let's  say Nazis 
and the Nazis themselves, and he picked out
 my professor and myself and they didn't 
allow any Jews to be uh to be accepted in cour
t even like pr actitioners, but I was lucky.  I 
was a me mber of the ________, a me mber of
 the _______ mo veme nt and there was in 
relations, permanent relations
 with the Lithuanian Na
tional Sports Club ________, and 
the ma n of ____ was a...also at the faculty
 of law, ________, and he 
graduated the very 
same month like I.  He was immediately lumi
nated as the Magistrate Court in my...in my 
native ______, so I went to him since I couldn'
t get any...in any court.  I couldn't get any 
position, place to to ma ke my my six m
onths ____. I went to him and said, ______, look, 
we are both sportsme n.  We were so ma
ny years together in __________ in the _______ 
Sports Club.  Would you engage 
me  as your practitioner at your
 court?  We graduated the 
same  month, so he...he couldn't... he couldn't 
refuse.  He said well, it's against all 
instructions I have, but simply I cannot refuse
 you.  We  were so ma ny yea r s in the sports 
field.  We  were four years at the same law school
, and I just can't refuse.  I take the risk.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234

So I I worked with him for a half a year in 
the...in the...in this...in the civil court and only 
then it was I could start pr
acticing at Professor Belaski'
s office.  You understand.  And 
here again Pr ofessor Belaski was a great, a gr
eat Jewess.  In addition, he was a ma n of 
esprit, of talent, of of spirit.  He he he...i
n addition to writing his monume ntal works on 
civil war that a generation was educated on 
his books, he wrote also a book, The Man and 
His Destiny, and this is cert
ain jokes, certain seriously a
bout the ma n and his destiny.  
When in the the...he told me , look, you got...you wa
lked in my office.  You must not seek 
only hours of eight to six or 
from four to eight.  You have to do your work.  Did you 
fin...when you finish the work, go home.  I f you 
didn't finish, stay until twelve, you see.  
And you...you know...we had in in this time in thos
e years, we didn't have such ____ like 
today.  You know, we...you had to
 write in ink and when you 
wrote with the with the 
pencil on the on the paper, it used to 
___, ____.  You don't have to _____...finish them 
all.  Do the work.  Don't ...don't...and he was th
e best lawyer in Lithuania.  He used to 
appear mostly in the Supreme Court of Lit
huania and in the Supreme Military Court and 
what is important for my beloved patron, he
 himself escaped from the revolution, from 
the Communist, escaped to Lithuani a, but here 
in Lithuania, he appeared in the military 
courts as counsel for the Communists who 
were were were in...brought to trial for 

belonging to the Communist Part
y, leave alone if they would 
have done some  sabotage or 
some thing like that, but the very fact that 
they belonged to the Communist Party, it was 
enough to give them twelve years in jail.  
And he defended them.  He defe nded them and 
he explained it clearly.  He he...what he told
 me a lawyer must 
be twenty-four hours a 
lawyer.  If some body goes wrong...have done in
justice to some body, you have to defend. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234

Every...a mu rderer has a right to
 get defense.  A lawyer should defend him, for the for the 
court is to decide whether he is guilt or not 
guilty, but he has the right to defense, and the 
same  goes for the Communists. 
 
Q: Avraham, tell me ...we were talking about wr
iting and how he wrote.  Whe n did you start 
to write your diary? 
 

A: Yes.  We ll, on the 22nd of June, the war break

out of Kovno.  They left the prison closed w
ithout any guards, and the prisoners went at

 All these aime d to one, to dehumanize, 
to to degrade, to hurt the feelings of Je
ws and ______.  And this was the most dramatic 
and the most historic last meeti
ng of the Jewish community in Kovno. 
 

Q: Why?  

 

A: On the 4th of August, 1941, at a school, th
ere set the most prominent leaders of the 
community were still alive, because ma ny we
re already ki lled.  Approximately five 
thousand Jews were killed on the roads, in
 the city and so on 
and then they...it was 
opened...the assembly was opened by Dr. _______ 
who one was very veteran leaders of 
the Jewish community in Kovno... 
 

Q: And you we re there? 

 

A: I couldn't be in the assembly with
 those ___________.  Because I I...you know, I I am 
telling you I was sitting in the the rabbi's uh apartment and I listened.  There was an elder 

report the first __________.  When they came back from... 
 

Q: Themeeting... 

 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234

A: When they came back fr om the committee, I will not enlarge what happened to them.  
They were arrested on the way from the from
 the Gestapo to their homes by Lithuanians 
and they were...and among these uh...there...Gol
dberg was a mili...a military officer, a 
high offi cer in the Lithuanian army.  He tr
ied to speak to the military commandant of 
Kovno who he knew.  He was in the same  military school and this the night _____..._ we 

have to ma ke it short, so this Goldberg we
nt to one of his fellows who wa s well-known.  

There was established a big new mi nistry, as 
if they would gain th
eir independence, the 
Lithuanians.  They sent cables of gratit
ude to Hitler signed by the Archbishop _____, by 
the Bishop ______, thanking him for  liberating uh
 Lithuania from the Soviets, you see, 
and uh so the Lithuanians were...and they imme
diately established a 
cabinet of mi nisters 
of Lithuania as if they would gain independe
nce, but the Germans, they never thought of 
of giving them their independence so... 
 

Q: Right.  So Avraham, tell me  
about the assembly, about the.... 

 

A: Yes.  So the assembly, the the...can we  ____, the chairman, and he and he spoke in very, 
very cloudy expressions and cloudy...cloudy, 
false pictures of the situation 
outside...outside the school where the where th
e meeting took place, and he said that the 
children are being kille
d, the wome n are being raped, all 
me n are being taken to slavery, 
arrested and so on.  There was not in the 
history of Jews a s
ituation like that, but 
nevertheless there were situations, hard s
ituations, and the Jewi
sh people always...the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
16
____, the _____ in the past, the ____ end was so 
that we survived them and he hoped that 
omens of this type Hitler will also...his e
nd will be  the _____ in the hi story of Jewish 
people, but nevertheless in desc
ri bing the terrible situation of the Jews, the desperate 
situation, he collapsed and he couldn't  conti
nue to talk.  Then came the problem the order 
of the Germans is that the Je
ws have to nominate a chief Jew and if the Jews themselves 
will not nominate a chief Jew, they will nom
inate themselves, and we had already the 
terrible experience of other places wh
ere they nomi nated, you know, a man who has no 
responsibility, with no background, no way...so 
there was also among the  candidates was 
Dr. Elkes.  The first candida
te was, of course, Garfunkle who was a me mber of the 
Parliame nt, the head of the Jewish faction in
 the Parliame nt, for instance that Goldberg 
who had uh was a a a front ____, a fighter for 
Lithuanian independence.  They had ____ 
but they they absolutely refused to take over 
the office because they knew this is going to 
be a servant ___ and into the 
of the of the Germans or the Nazis, and nobody wanted to 
be to betray his his his commun
ity, the Jewish people.  More 
so that at that  time we knew 
already that the the chief Jew from Vilna 
(ph), Dr. _______, very famous J e wish leader, 
community leader, he ______, so nobody wanted to 
take over and therewas a stalemate.  
In a way...no way out and nobody would take any 
office, so then stood up Schumuckler, 
Rabbi Schumuckler, who was a absolutely 
unknown rabbi from a suburb of _____ and he 
stood up but yet who was in ma in kind of way...everybody agreed and everybody wanted 

that Dr. Elke s.  Why Dr. Elkes, Elchanan
 ELkes.  Because he was one of the best 
physicians in Lithuania.  He was the privat
e physician of the Germ
an a mbassador and of 
the Soviet ambassador and of all ambassadors, 
so they thought that he mi ght because of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
17
his relationship being a private doctor for th
e German a mba ssador, he mi ght have have 
some  influe nce and ma ybe do some  good or avoid some  hardships and so on, but of 
course this had nothing to with that. 
 

Q: How did he respond to the nomination? 

 

A: He...I will tell you before I an
swer.  He said no because the...according to the Germans, 
who have to go to the ghetto, there we will 
have a municipality for ourselves.  We will 

have our own community, a closed co mmunity. 
 No Lithuanians will be  will be allowed.  
No no Ger man will be allowed to go inside. 
You will be free to ma
nage your life as well 
you can, so each was supposed to be a municipa
l...a a chairman of a municipal council, 
so Dr. Elkes says I have no experience at a
ll in municipality, in 
municipality...municipal 
work.  I never have done anything but physic
ian.  He was the head of the interior 
departme nt of the Jewish big hospital in Li
thuania, Bikkur Holim, and he was...I said I 
was all my life a doctor and I have no any wh
atsoever experience in
 in municipal work. 
 

Q: So what persuaded him?  

 

A: So then...so then it was a stalemate. 
 Nobody...and the Germans said if we will not 
nomi nate, they will nominate and this was th
e worst thing that  could happen to us and 
before long in despair, then stood up the 
the rabbi, Rabbi Schumuckler and he said, 
________.  I appeal to Dr. Elkes.  Ever
ybody...since you are the most...are the most 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
18
suitable to be a head of whole community in 
this unusual, unique time  of rest...risks and 
despair.  You have the experience as a great doctor.  You know the German ambassador 
and and you...for who you be a chief Jew, a ove
rjuder for us.  You will be the respected 

______, the head of the community, ________.  
Those who will fu
lfill a mi ssion of 
_____, they can never fail and they can neve
r be harmed and we will be...go with you 
until the end and we will help you and we 
will assist you.  We will be at your ___ at 
anytime, and so though  _______ or head of th
e committee here, and you will with God's 
help...the rabbi of course  ______ don't repeat 
it so much...with God's help, you will lead 
us to the end of the war, and you will lea
d...take us out from t he ghetto which is a _____ 
inside _____, and you will bring us to the fatherland and ___ soil, and there you will be 

the head of a community and so and so.  Ev
erybody was in tears.  He was so emotional 
and he was so persuasive, and Dr. Elkes 
stood in the corner.  He never never stood 
_____, and he stood up and he said, if you all thi
nk that I mu st...it is me that must lead, 
the chief juden, the overjuden, I'm he re.  He sacrificed hims elf for the community 

_________, and when he said I am here, he says y
ou, so this wa s in great relief in the in 
in in in the whole and everybody stood up on 
his leg...on their feet 
and they actually 
____________ and they shake...shook hands with him.  It was a a most...a most 

emotional scene that can never before _____ until 
the rest  of my life.  And then he took 
his post as chair...from the chair of the Germ
ans and then I and together with two other 
lawyers, young lawyers who ca me  to him a
nd said Dr. Elkes, we greet you and we 
ask...place ourselves from now on to your enti
re disposition _____ be 
ever be what ma y 
need, we are with you and ______ young lawyers.  I was the speaker.

Q: Why did you that?   Did you know him?  

 

A: Because...because I knew... 

 

Q: Why did you have such faith in him?  

 

A: I'll tell you.  There was not a person in Lithua
nia that didn't know the 
best...the the doctor 
but in addition I knew Dr. Elkes because the 
only thing that he was...he was never a 
me m...me mber of any Zionist
 party, was never any committees.  He was a doctor one 

hundred percent, but he was one of the three 
trustees of the _______ found in Lithuania.  
We both in Lithuania lent and for ______, before
, prior to making their ___ to ___ Israel, 
they were trained in agricultural in or der 
to pr epar e them to the life in agriculture. 
 

Q: But tell me  why did you have so mu ch fa
ith in him?   What kind of person was he? 
 

A: Just a mi nute.  Just a mi nute.  First of all, if you know ________ well 
the three trustees of 
the _________, this is like pioneer, he wa
s also their doctor and ____________ because 
we as a Zionist...as a chairman of the Zi
onist youth move me nt, I knew him from that 
_____, and meeting with him, and most of the 
people knew in Israel...in in Lithuania of 
Dr. Elkes as a very...very broad-mi nded uh 
physician.  He was the physician of the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
20
president, of the prime minist
er and of the poorest people who gave me dical help without 
without any pay. 
 
Q: How would you describe him as a person? 

 

A: He...let me  tell you.  First of all, you shoul
d know Elkes was born not far away from my 
town like Ka lvarija (ph) and there he got a 
very strong religious e
ducation.  There were 
no schools in...at that time...he was born in '70...i
n 1870 mor e  or less.  At that time there 
were no schools.  There were only yeshivas
 for the bigger ones and there were only a 
rabbi and a hadder, you know, where they they 
taught the children to learn A - B - C and 
to pray, you see, and this is...he
 got a very strong religious...r
eligious education from the 
very youth and then in his own way he he uh he made, you know, his doctor degree and 

nobody knows how he...how he ma naged it, how he
 went to ____ and he and he and he 
studied me dicine without even prior graduati
ng ___ so he had to ma ke exams special and 

so on, but this is what he was.  He was...he was a very well-known and he was well-

known because of his great understanding fo
r the needy and for the poor, for the 

_________, for...and and not only for the Jewish n
eedy.  For others.  You see, he was a 
great ma n and at the same  ti me , he didn't turn his nose up. 
 

Q: He was a generous ma n? 

 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
21
A: He was a most generous ma n and known like 
that.  He was a very rich ma n.  He was a 
very rich ma n and mi nd you, I want to jump now.
..in his...in his last wi
ll, in the ghetto he 
wrote in the ghetto in 1943 in Hebrew 
language, which he gave...handed over to me  
before I escaped from the ghetto, he he didn'
t me ntion not a single word of his of his 
richness.  It was a very big property in this in
 this most fashionable 
part of the city of 
Kovno.  His children he sent, because of bei
ng a rich ma n, he s e nt his two children, his 
son and his daughter, to London and this is 
Professor ____ Elkes who you me t in there, 
he was then in London, and this is the last will 
that they allowe d to him and to his sister, 
and this is will that to be passed to him 
(laughter) before I escaped from the ghetto.  
Nobody knew will I at all succeed in to pass through and so on, so he was a great Zi onist , 
a great Jew, a great devoted Je
w with a very deep feeling of
 Jewish heritage.  He had a 
responsibility and when he took over, he was known only as a physician, only as a great 

physician and we gave trust in him because of his special relationshi p with the German 
ambassador, but then he had shown hims elf by 
his day-to-day daily 
steps, dealing with 
the Russians.  For instance...I'l  give you an instance... 
 
Q: Alright.  Tell me . 

 

A: In 1940...the very beginning of the ghett
o, came  to me  a Mr. Bronson (ph) who was a 
director of a Hebrew school and a lawyer 
who was not a Zionist, ____, and they came to 
me  as secretary of the of the Jewish co
mmittee and they told me , look, there is a 
possibility to buy a gun.  Can you speak to to 
to the Jewish committee that they should 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
22
give money to pay, to buy the gun?   So I we
nt to Garfunkle, the Deputy.  He says good, a 
gun.  What they talking?  It is dangerous. 
 It will be dangerous
 for all the ghetto.  
Don't...don't  me ntion it.  So I we
nt to Dr. Elkes.  So Dr. Elke
s said go to the treasurer and 
tell him that I order that 
you give to Bronson the money to
 buy the gun.  Both very...I...I 
most Jews devoted but here is a ma n of
 the season, of daring _____, most very ______, 
you see.  Then the first days when you came in into the ghetto... 
 
Q: Tell me  about those.  Tell me  about 
the ghetto and the cr
eation of the ghetto. 
 

A: So you see, so when it sees the the the Lit
huanians attacks on the Jews in the cities, in 
their dwellings, in in the stor
es, in in the street s.  They
 attacked terr ibly.  It was 
impossible to pass the street for a Jew, and 
they said...uh we were three lawyers.  The 
second lawyer...one of the three wa
s killed two days after he wa
s elected.  On the 6th of 
August, there was...they killed a thousand Je
ws on the street, and among t hem prominent 
leaders like _________, so so we rema ined two,
 two of  us.  Dr. _____ was the elder one 
so he was the secretary, and I was the deput
y secretary.  On the 15th of August was the 
last day to close up the Jews in the ghetto, bu
t because of the riots, day in, day out, in the 
city Je ws left the city already by the end of Ju
ly because there in this area they run out, 
the local Jews steps in.  You understand.  This
 was the situation.  Jews themselves went 
and then when it came  nearer to the ghetto, th
e Lithuanian municipali
ty ordered that the 
Jews themselves should build the barbed
 wire fence around the ghetto, the Jews 
themselves, and I have a letter in my co
llection from the from the municipality of...you 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
23
are ordered to bring fi
fty Jews for the building of the of
 the gate around the...not the gate 
but the barbed wire around the ghetto, and they
 should bring ma terial, their own ma terial.  
The next day you should bring a hundred pe
ople, a hundred Jews, and I have a photo 
where the Jews were building the fence ar
ound the ghetto, and this remi nds me  a very 
Russian song.  I told you I know Russian, so th
ere is a song...brick layer, brick layer...is 
that one passes by and sees brick layers are 
laying brick on the buildings that they are 
building.  ____ all the buildings, so it says 
brick layer, brick layer, for whom do you 
build these...these buildings. 
 For whom are you laying the bricks?   So he said you don't  
disturb me .  _____ we are very busy in build
ing...they are building...building a prison for 
themselves.  And this what I had in mi nd 
when I saw these me n building around the...but 
these were the Lithuani ans, not the Ge rmans. 
 
Q: Describe to me  what were the 
living conditions lik
e in the ghetto? 
 

A: What...we are not in the ghetto yet.  Wait a 
mi nute.  So you see, the...already from before 
the ghetto, they were rationed...Jews were not
 allowed to appear before ten on the 
markets, open markets, because let the Lithua
ni ans buy whatever it is and whatever the 
rest, ___ were taken to Jews, but then we were
 now forbidden at all and this order of the 
10th of July, 1941, Jews were forbidden to a
ppear in the open ma rkets to buy from non-
Jews, to hire vehicles from non-Jews, to 
use help of non-Jews...absolutely.  And they 
were rationed hundred grams bread a day...hundred grams bread a day.  Hundred and 

twenty-five gram meat a week, fifty grams sa
lt a month so it's clear that on this no one 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
24
could could live.  Even to st
arve was nothing left, but what was most i mportant, when the 
ghetto was closed, there were ma ny J e wish inst
itutions in in social, me dical, cultural, 
yeshiva and all kinds, so but they were all 
kinder...uh house for orphans, so they brought 
on the on the 15th of August when it was the 
the last day of entering the ghetto, the 
Lithuanians brought in a truck, two trucks lo
ad of children from orphans, from Jewish 
children's home that remained there and they
 pulled them out on the entrance of the 
ghetto on the on the on the paveme nt and they left them. 
 

Q: Did you see this? 

 

A: I was there.  First of al
l you should know what I was not pr
esent and what I did not see 
and what I di d not see, you'll not hear from 
me, because it was...I went back and forth, 
back and forth, so and then we were all in ghetto. 
 

Q: How did you respond, Avraham, when you saw th
at?   I mean, what did you think?   What 
were some  of your...? 
 

A: ...the first thing to do was to allow.... 

 

END OF TAPE 1   - SIDE 1 

 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
25
A: ...we had a fire brigade, and the fire 
brigade came imme diately, you know, and to take 
these children and bring them in
to where...we didn't  have an orphan's home in the ghetto.  
We didn't have a children's home  in the ghe
tto.  Where to bring them?   So we brought 
them in a certain place what was formerly a sc
hool just to be able temporarily that they 
be under a roof.  This was how the Lithuani
ans behaved ______ to to orphans, and this 
was...I...if there is a God, I don't believe, but 
if there is a God, they should be punished 
for this.  They should never gain their inde
pendence.  Never...never...never.  And then, 
three days after we were incarcerated in the 
ghetto, they finished the the the barbed wi re 
fence around the ghetto and the gate and then 
three days...and they every day they gave 
Jewish committee head to mobilize Jewish work
ers for the various German places to to 
clean the barracks, military barracks and the 
Gestapo uh building, to clean the paveme nt, 
to...tailors, uh pressers 
and all kinds of things. 
 
Q: Hold up on...are we out of tape?   OK.   
 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION.  

 

END OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 2 

 

 

A: ...and then they comme nce to know what I've said. 

 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
26
Q: Oh, that it's  wonderful.  They'r e hearing ex
actly everything they need to.  OK?   So what 
I'd like to start back is on those first days of
 the ghetto.  Tell me  about those first days of 
the ghetto, would you?   What was it like? 
 
A: Yes.  So fi rst of all, the fi rst terribl e bl
ow that we  got to to burst out of the children, 
orphans, on the _________ the Lithuanians, but on
 the third day of the ghetto on the 18th 

of August...15th of August the ghet
to was closed...nobody come s in, nobody goes 
out...and the 18th of Aug...and they used everyday used to send workers to to town, to 

various places outside of the ghe
tto.  This was hard work, very
 hard work that Jews were 
not used to do, for instance in building...brick... la
ying bricks or in the barracks to to the 
the the me n's rooms and the the other cleaning di
rty things, so they said they need five 
hundred workers of academic (ph) professions for archives work, so people were so 

enthusiastic about this opport
unity.  Instead of going and cl
eaning the lavatories and and 
and to build the roads and so on, so there a
ppears five hundred thirty-four, and they took 
them out from the ghetto and they killed them in the very same  day.  And when 

Lithuanians who could see from around the fort
...fortress, they there were...the next day 
came Jewish workers nearby and had to walk to the _______ and they showed 

them...they ________ the Jews.  We didn't belie
ve.  We  couldn't believe how can...how 
can five hundred thirty-four
 innocent me n, reputable th
en...lawyers, engineers, 
chemistries, uh physicians...why should they be 
killed without trial, without interrogation.  
We couldn't believe it because this was on th
e third of the ghetto.  And then Dr. Elkes 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
27
tried to go from one to the other, from one 
to the other, the dignitaries and not the 
dignitaries, and the civil...and the civil uh author
ity and then in the in
 the in the police... 
 
Q: What was he doing?   Was he tryi
ng to find out what 
happened or why? 
 

A: Yes.  He said I'm the chairman of the Jewish committee and the overjuden.  He spoke in 
their language and I am responsible for these Je
ws.  I have to give a reply.  I I I...please 
tell me why didn't they co me.  When will th
ey come?  Where are they now?  What are 
they doing, you see?   He didn't speak in this
 tone like I'm talking now, but he...he found 

always the right expression...first
 of all not to to hurt thei
r Nazi dignity, and second to 
force them to to to to answer him fi rst of a
ll, to answer him, and to answer him in a way 
like a human being, because a Jew is not a human being.  You understand?  So they...first 

of all a Jew doesn't  deserve that he he should ge
t an answer at all.  But Dr. Elkes put it in 
a way and the...he just told them of his uh 
relationship with the German a mbassador.  
_________.  It worked some...sometimes.  Muc
h...not much...uh but nevertheless, but he 
is a very...is a...was a mo st courageous ma
n and he always said nothing can happen to 
me .  My sixty-four...five years are behind me  
and he always kept in his small pocket a 
poison and he said if worse come s to worse, 
he will...he will not fall 
in their hands alive 
and uh and he...and he asked which was very
 dangerous.  Nobody, no insurance company 
in the world would give insurance for the li
fe of Dr. Elkes.  Yes.  Because every 
small...not don't speak about the the _______ 
commisar or the deputy _____ commis ar 
who was responsible for the ghetto was himsel
f a murderer, so a murderer...the the first 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
28
ruler of the ghetto from th
e civil authority was the de
puty ____ commis ar of Kovno by 
the name  of Jordan (ph), and why the _________...he write his name  Jordan, but he was 
just a terrible guy. 
 

Q: Terribleperson? 

 

A: Terrible...ama ssmurderer. 
He...for instance, he used to
 come  in into the Jewish 
committee office.  He never opened the door.  
He didn't take the handle of the door and 
open it.  No.   Because the handle of the door kept Jews and he cannot ma ke...put his 

hands on a on a on a handle that the Jews
 have kept _______.  It would be dirty, his 
hands, you see, so he used to open with 
his boots, push the door
...open the door with a 
with a crash and the very 
appearance of hi m was alrea
dy thunder of _____ and and and 
unrest and of and of God knows what it brings. 
 And he would be so so uh harsh and that 
even the superiors in Berlin thought  he doesn
't  know how to behave before his superiors 

be...because ...not because he was too harsh to
wards Jews.  Towards Jews you cannot be 
harsh enough because the the final solution is 
the final solution of every Jew, but he took 
over certain functions that wasn't  in in the in
 the priority...in the in
 the authority of his 
superiors...________, so they sent him to the to 
the front and he was killed there, you see, 
and so it turned out that these five hundred a
nd thirty-four, they had to admit to Dr. Elkes 
finally that they were killed 
by the thirty-four that
 sabotaged the Jews too.  They were 
supposed to...in in a in a store 
of sugar, they poured in gas...gasoline, and so this was why 

they were killed.  Of course, this was the Nazi
 ______ but this is what they said, so in the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
29
first three...after the third day 
of the ghetto, this is what we 
learned and what is ghetto all 
about, because we didn't know what it was about
.  And these, of course, such things 
didn't let me  rest for several days, and I wrote ab
out it at night.  I want
ed to start actually 
our interview with me ntioning the fam
ous Jewish historian, ________.  He wrote 
monume ntal books on history of the Jewish peop
le.  He lived in _____ at the time  of t he 
outbreak of the war with Russia, with Germ
any and when the Nazis came to take hi m 
from his home, uh he...t he only word that he
 could spell out before he was taken by 
surprise, recorded and this I kept in mi nd 
all the years, recorded...the Germans never 
wanted to that the outer wo
rld to know what's  goi ng on inside the ghetto.  They never 
wanted to know what activities the ma ss mu
rderers had enforced.  It was my inner 
impulse, a driving...inner driving force to
 put it in writing because I was myself 
overwhelmed.  I couldn't talk to anybody about 
this.  There wa s not a possibility to talk 
because there was so take n the day to day 
and hour to hour with work in the Jewish 
community and I I uh I had a secretary and I ha
d to go to the to the German offices uh to 
in town to ask, for instance, let's say the the l
east.  We  had an office.
  We needed pencils.

A: Oh and how...and how.  This was the great
 thing.  For instance
, I'll tell you...where 
to...this was...you asked me  about life...this wa
s the daily life in th
e ghetto, but in in 
addition, we had for instance Pnina, the same  
Pnina, but from this Pnina would not...there 

was not another one.  As I told you, she had a ve
ry tiny place.  Then she got a little bi gger 
place and we had a circle, cultural circle, eight
 to ten people. There was a poet and there 
were two...two writers and then there was a 
Jewish writer, a Polish Jewish writer _____ 
who wrote a very great novel and there was a...t
he head of the cultura
l departme nt of the 
ghetto, Dr. _______, and uh there were Garfunkle who is a...was a me mber  of the 

parliame nt and myself, so we 
used to meet once in two weeks for two hours.  Where?   In 
Pnina's dwelling.  Where did we sit there?   You cannot imagine.  But there we sit two 

hours, each one...one used to read all of his 
poems  and we had a journa list, Dr. ____, who 
listened to the...to understand radio and he us
ed to report on what's going on the front.  
And he...he was called around the the the intel
ligence...military intelligence report.  And 
there was one that was reading from what he
 had written and some ti me s I used to read 
one of my e ntries.  These were two hours of 
inspiration, that not everything is lost, that 
not everything is bread, that not everything is
 tears, that there is life in in __________.  In 
the depths of hopelessness, there is a strife of 
light and this strife of
 light in my case it 
was Pnina, of course, but everyone had a ______. Such two hours intellectual, cultural.  

This was entirely contra to what the gh
etto stands for, entirely ____ to what is 
surrounding, but we felt a need in this.  You unde
rstand.  Or for instance, I wa,s as I told 
you, one of the founders and leaders of the 
Zionist underground, so one day I get a call

from the from the ghetto, ma in ghetto gate.   
There...there is one wo
ma n that speaks...she 
is...she wants to speak to you.  She asked for ________ and when we said that _____ 
cannot be reached, she asked for _______.  I didn
't  know who who was it, so give it to 
me .  So she tells me  _____.  Yes.  I 
bring regards to you from _____.  _______ was a 
Zionist underground in Vilna that 
we heard from our correspondence.  So I told her, tell 
him take care and bring her straight to me.  
Who was it?   It was Irena Adamowicz, who is 
in the book.  She was a Polish that was ve
ry much close to the _____ movement in 
Poland and she was going from ghetto to ghett
o, bringing reports to each other and it was 
for the first time  after a year that we heard 
______ came.  She  said I want to talk to you, 
so I said please talk.  She says no, I want to 
talk you in private.  So
 I went in one of the 
rooms. She says I come now from Vilna. I 
am...I bring regards from _____ or from t his 
or from this...so of course we cannot talk 
here.  She says alright, so I arranged 
imme diately a meeting of...____ me e ting 
of the committee of the _____ of the 
underground at my private dwelling and I
...there were two from the underground ____ 
that said alarm if some body come s in and all 
went to to work in my...because they were 

in my dining room where all the me mbers 
of the executive of the Zionist underground 
and in addition Dr. Elkes and Garfunkle, 
yes, and uh and uh Dr. uh Dr. Shapiro was 
there.  There was a _________ who was also a 
me mber of the underground.  For a half a 
day long, she reported to us on what's going on in
 the ghettos.  For the first time that it 
told what could be...you know, some thing was 
going on behind the barbed wires.  We  

never had a slightest idea a
nd here come s a woman.  She 
spoke fluently Yiddish, and 
that's why the gate...they couldn't...the y couldn'
t be suspicious because if she would speak 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
47
Polish or something, they wouldn't let her in 
at all.  You understand?  And this woma n 
disclosed to us for the first time so open, a 
little little ______ say in Hebrew, in English, 
____, a little window, a small window to the out
er world, what goes on in Wa rsaw, what 
goes on in Vilna, what goes on in Lodz.  A
nd then we reported to her on what's going on 
in the ghetto and she was amazed, so this en
counter with such a Polish Catholic woma n 
who is exceptional.  By the way, she came to
 Palestine the ______ Israel, in '56, and she 
was _______ .  You cannot imagine what...to te
ll you...unfortunately none of my sisters 
uh survived.  They all we re perished in the 
war, but even if my sister would come  I 
wouldn't be so happy she was there, and they
 took her around and everything.  I ____ out 

of my way and I look to please her and so 
on, but she was a Communi
st.  Of course ____, 
and this is where we...where we differed.  But 
this very meeting inside the ghetto with an 
outsider was in itself a breakthrough, not ex
actly what the Germans intended...their 
intention to to close us behind barbed wires,
 that nothing should be known to us what's  
going on and nothing should be going out what
's  going on inside and when the 28th of 
October...this terrible day, the most terribl
e day in the ghetto, 
the selection of 28,000 
people, inma tes of the ghetto, and they toldit...I don't want to repeat because they spoke 

about it with regard to Dr. 
Elkes this morning before, so 
this selection of eight, ten 
thousand were in one day...all of a sudden we fe
lt that we are...if it can happen in one day 
that the me n ________ their own finger in their, ____... 
 

Q: Pointing. 

 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
48
A: Pointing, since ten thousand toda
y, so we would have been _____. 
 
Q: How did this...that happen?    Didthey call people to the square or...? 

 

A: I beg you pardon?   Firs
t of all, the the Gest
apo said that in ghetto are people who are 
working hard and there are people who areworking less, and people who don't work at 

all, so we'll know that the portions of food 
for those who are working is not enough.  We 
know that hundred grams of bread per day 
per person who works is not enough, so we 
want to enlarge this portion fo
r those who are working and to 
leave the portions that are 
now only for those who don't work in order to
 ma ke sure who is...these who are working, 
so we want that you should...all...all the in
mates of the ghetto, th
irty thousand, should 
report on the 28th of October on the big square de mocratic, families-wise and groups of 

working-wise, you see, and then when they ma ke they ma ke uh divide separately in one 
place those who are working hard and those 
get double rations and those who are don't 
work will get the sa me  rations as now.  So Dr
. Elkes said if this should be done, he said, 
we can do it ourselves.  We take...give you th
e list of the people ____ ourselves out of 
departme nt of supply, we'll give double rations
 to those who are wo
rking and give less 
rations, the same  rations to those who are not
.  For that purpose, you don't need all of the 
30,000 inma tes of the ghetto to report on on on 
the democratic square.  We  we we do not 
believe that  this is the true reason for for th
at order and Elkes worked very hard and he 
me t twice with Roka (ph).  As I told 
you...and what did they 
tell Elkes to __________.  
Mr. Roka, Mr. Comma nder, ma y I talk to
 you as ma n to ma n?   It is not....

Q: Avraham, let's stop here because we have le
ss than a mi nute of tape.  And I want them to 
switch the tapes... 
 

END OF T APE 2  

 

Q: OK, Avraham, you were telling me  about th
e ma ssive selection on that day.  You were 
telling me  about the selection. 
 

A: Yes.  So uh Dr. Elkes tried to squeeze out fr
om Roka what is the re
al reason for ordering 
thirty thousand people, old and young, sick and 
healthy, uh babies in in in the arms  of 
their...children...why do they have to go to 
the court?   Will..if it's a ma tter of food 
rationing, we 'll arrange it.  So he says no, th
e Jews are too much uh close to each other 
and they have...and they aren't  very...they 
aren't  very...for each other, they they 
wouldn't...they they cannot trust others will do 
it.  They'll give to one and they'll share 
with the others and...to cut a long story short, 
we did not believe that
 this is the real 
reason for for ordering all on the square anda certain...certain me mbers of the of the 

Jewish community...Jewish commi ttee said that 
we should not uh give the instructions or 
we should not ma ke public the order.  Why s
hould the Gestapo itself 
not ma ke public?   It 
should write in public...why would they want us
.  They wanted because if it would more 
information and an announcement of the Jewish
 committee, there would se em that if the 
Jewish committee is ordering that, and this under no circums t ances wanted to do, so 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
50
finally they decided that we 
should ask the...to consult the chief rabbi Shapiro (ph) who 
was a a scholar of world fa me .  He was at one
 time a candidate to be the chief rabbi of 
____ Israel, and uh we we went to him and he he 
said that it's  a very hard question and he 
has to check with the...and when we come ...he told us to come  at eleven...at eleven 
o'clock night and then he told us to come  at
 five o'clock in the morning and he was not 
ready, and then to cut a long 
story short, he came very 
along and finally he said...he 
phoned...in in certain conditions that the Je
wish community was placed into a a a a 
situation, that if there 
is a possibility to rescue part 
of the community and not the whole 
community, the Jewish leadership has to do ever
ything in order to rescue the this what is 
possible.  I'll tell you later 
about the the very famous stor
y about the two went in the 
desert and had also le
ft one cup of water and it was suffi
cient only for one of them. I f one 
of them will drink the water, the other wi
ll die.  If both of them will drink, nobody 
will...and this is...so after having 
heard this this uh consultation of the chief rabbi, it was 
the wording of the of the of the for ma
tion of the ________...the announcement was in a 
say that the Gestapo ordered the Jewi sh populat
ion of the ghetto to 
appear, not that the 
Jewish committee but the Gestapo ordered the Jewish community...so and those who will 

not appear at the...at six o'clock in the mo
rning, and those who will not appear at six 
o'clock in the morning and they will be 
found in their house, each one which will be 

found in his house will be  killed on the spot.  They shall leave open the houses, the doors, 

the the shutters, everything, and finally uh th
ere were several...uh and where there is a 
sick ma n, they should put in writing, they shoul
d put in writing that there is a sick ma n 

that is immo vable, that cannot be transporte
d, and of course all t
hose who were left and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
51
killed...they killed them and at six o'clock in
 the morning, there was 
thirty thousand went 
with ______ in their hands, to...from various pa
rts of the ghetto to 
this square and I 
______ it as the funeral of the vi
ctims themselves.  The inma te
s themselves went to their 
own funeral, because nobody knew what w
ill happen and who will go and who will not 
go, and at eight o'clock in the morning, Roka stood up on the top of... 
 

Q: Was the square just  packed? 

 

A: Over-crowded...and it wa s fa mily-wise and 
work groups-wise.  Those...all those who 
worked at the airport should be all together
 in one group.   Those who worked in cleaning 
and and in the Gestapo building, they should all 
in their places of work and the name  of 
the place of work.  And the Jewish po
lice separate ____ the Je wish uh committee 
separate with the Jewish and so on, and then 
Roka started...at eight o'
clock, he started...he 
stood up on the upper hill in order to have a 
a a overlook all this group and he started 
______...____ to ma rch forward and they used to 
pass by him and then he used to say 
_____, _____, ____, right.  And usually the people 
see that right is the better...better.  
Left is not good and at this time exactly the 
opposite to the right and it happened so that 
people were very lucky that they
 were sent to the to the right
, but the...to the right they 
sent the old people, the child
ren, those who are not capable of working, who cannot be 
the..of real...any assistance to the 
to the to the effort of war, 
of the Germa n effort of war, 
and this took place all the day long.

Q: Was there pa nic? 
 

A: I beg your pardon? 

 

Q: Was there pa nic? 

 

A: Not panic at all, but but but uh let's 
say uh they waited and nobody know...knew what is 
going...nobody knew that it's want to be dea

with the other hand he kept a sandwich, and 
he kept handkerchiefs and they ate very 
tasteful ____ but they kept also that his fi

sandwich he had, _______.  It was just terrible 
to see a ma n without any huma n feelings 
at all.  He eats with one hand the sandwich 
and other says left, ri
ght, left, right, and Dr. 
Elkes stood not far away from hi m a nd tried to get out some body from the left to the right 

side.  He said this is a very important carpe
nter and this is a brick layer and this is a 
very...a very machinist, artisan
 and so on.  He tried to help
 but in the end of the day...and 
and this took all the day long and people, th
e old me n fell on the spot in on the on the 
democratic square.  Old people or
 sick people, they fainted.  They were left there.  They 

didn't even reach the the selection point.  They
 just  left where they were, you see.  And 
uh and the uh it it ended approxima tely th
at six in the evening when it's already 
sun...sunshine is down, sunset, and then then
 thousands of people went straight...they 
went over to the smaller ghetto that was...w

and they liquidated the small part of the 
ghetto and this and this vacated part that 
they killed approxima tely the thousand people 
on the 4th of October...they left in the ten 
thousand people were and Elkes tried and when 
he...Elkes stood all the day long and didn't 
want to sip...he didn't want to take a 
sip...water, nothing.  He says oh why should I 
live up to this day and why...what have I 
done wrong that destiny just goes...and 
he stood all day and he didn't mo ve. 
 
Q: What were some  of your  thoughts? 

 

A: I beg your pardon? 

 

Q: What were some  of your  emotions that you were...? 
 
A: I was close to him.  

 

Q: And what were you thinking? 

 

A: I...I'll tell you why.  He was closing a
nd when some body of the police and there was a 
very veteran Zionist ma n over the age of se
venty.  He was the owner of the Hebrew 
library ____, so he was alone so I told Dr. 
Elkes, when ____ passes by, try to rescue him, 
you know, so we...we just told him.  We were 
busy all the day.  I at 
least you see, but, of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
54
course, he he he rescued that this was a ve
ry small part, and in 
the evening came to Dr. 
Elkes at his home  those who 
were separated, husband from men and then from children 
from parents and so on, and they asked him...and then Dr. Elkes uh asked the ______, the 

commander of the police, of the Jewish police,
 to ask from Roka th
at they should take 
home  from t hose 10,000, hundred me n who were in to to...in his language these were 

very important artisan (ph)...this is a very
 important physician, and this is a very 
important this...and the next morning when th
ey were all from the small ghetto on their 
ma rch to the 9th Fortress to the to the _________, the the Germans called the 9th Fortress 

Anhilation (ph) Point Nu mber 2, and of course 
in their secret uh but I got it, you see, and 

so Dr. Elkes was permitted to go in and take

of them, Dr. Elkes rescue us.  One took him 
by hi s sleeves.  Another 
took him by his foot.  
Another took him by his head and they take

great tumult, you see, and they ma rch them to
 the 9th Fortress _____ all the all the the the 
ten thousand were mi xed up and the Lithuanian
 partisans entered a

terribly on his head and he fell and he fainted

END OF T APE 3  
 
Q: Avraham, what I would like to
 st art with is for you to tell us what were so me of the the 
private ways that people deci
de the Nazi regulations and 
the Nazi laws in the ghetto? 
 

A: Well, we usually read and hear about the 
heroic uprising of the 
Wa rsaw ghetto, of the 
Lodz ghetto and so on.  Also in Kovno, the 
uh the escape from the 9th Fortress, the 
legendary escape from the 9th Fortress that
 you read later _____, so I uh but the ma in...I 
always am trying to stress and this is what I'
ve done in my diary I think, to stress the fight 
of the each individual, of the inma te, the pl
ain ma n or woma n in the ghetto, even the the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
56
boy...child...for survival of one day.  Some times 
s urvival of another hour in the hope that 
some thing mi ght happen. 
 

Q: And what did they do when you...? 

 

A: So fi rst of all, the rations that the Germ
ans gave to feed the inma tes was a ration for 
starvation.  No one could live on a hundred gr
ams, but also this hundred grams of bread, 
the uh the inmates didn't...the the the individu
al inma te didn't get because we had kept 
secret two thousand souls in the ghetto.  Babi
es that had been born despite the the strict 
order to cut off pregnancies.  Second there 
were old me n or sick me n that if you would 
put them on the register of the in...inmates of  the ghetto, they would have been killed, so 

this two thousand...approxima tely two thousand had to be...to get food, so we cut off 

from the general portion that we got uh so 
everyone got only approxima tely eighty grams 
or eighty-five grams of bread so that the othe
rs can get also.  So 
each one in his own way 
tried to get additiona l food.  You couldn't go in in the supermarket and buy it.  You 

couldn't go in because in the ghetto there was 
nothing, so people used to go to the...to 
work outside town and there try to get out
 for ten or fifteen mi nutes and buy and buy...not 
buy because nobody sold.  It's war time  and it we
re sanctions also in the city but the 
Lithuanians had enough food but they wanted al
ways to trade in.  They would give you a 
loaf of bread or half a loaf of bread for a 
pair of trousers or stoc
kings or a jacket or 
whatever.  I...for reason I reme mber it was 
the 31st of December, 1942.  My present wife 
sold out...already sold out everything she got
, but she...there was left a gown, you know, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
57
for the ball, for very festivity...made big festivities.  She was a rich woma n, so...but 
nobody bought a gown in in in time  of war, so 
we had in the opera house in in in Kovno, 
there were a group of Jewish workers who worked then in the opera house as 

dressmakers, as uh as to make the haircu
ts and uh you know, ____, and they were also  
working and cleaning the the opera house so I 
took Pnina and went as workers in that 

brigade and she took along with her the 
gown.  It was a wonderful gown, you know, and 
with the...accordingly also a pair of shoe
s, you know...elegant, and there on the 31st of 
the...before...the eve of the New Year, the 
actresses there jumped on this me rchandise, 
you see, and so she she got some  bread and and a little bit of uh of uh sugar, you see, for 

the gown, which costed hundreds and hundreds.  
Just in one of the examples of one 
fought for the survival of another day, mo
re so when she had a small child and she 
needed...badly needed milk that you couldn't 
get in the ghetto, leave alone an egg, you 

see, so this was an opportunity for her to br
ing milk and then when she got it all and she 
got rid of her gown and this, it was a problem 
how to pass the control 
at the ghetto gate.  
When...at the ghetto gate there always sentries of the ghetto commandant, the German 

ghetto comma ndant, then all the Lithuanians on 
one side.  From inside there were the uh 
employees of the Jewish labor exchange who us
ed to to arrange the exit of the laborers in 
the groups from the ghetto out to outside to th
eir pl aces of work and they were...had ways 
and means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the 
Li thuanian or the German, and so they keep 
uh close... close an eye and and they pass by, take
 part of it and give them as bribe you 
see, but nevertheless some thing left, and in th
is way people tried...trie
d not to starve, just 
plainly...very plain words...not to
 starve.  And uh some  some  others used to to get 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
58
a...make this deal of trade in above or thr
ough the ghetto fence.  Th
ere wa s a barbed wire 
fence, two me ters high.  The Lithuanians knew th
at there is a shortage of food inside the 
ghetto, so they used to come  and from a from 
a distance show a loaf of bread or show a a 
sugar or show five eggs, you see, and the a
nd the...from inside the ghetto they used to 
show a pair of trousers or a 
jacket or some thing like that
, and when they...when they nod 
of the of the of the head, they came to to
 an agreement or they trade in, so when 
the...along...along the barbed wire always twen
ty-four hours a day, the 
sentry used to go 
back and forth, back and forth, so the mome nt when the sentry used to go, let's say to the 

left, they used to throw above
...above the the uh fence to the L
ithuanians and they used to 
to send...to throw above the the food, and 
we used to call it _____.  A ______.  You 
know what is a ____ in the war, a _____, and this was a  _____ me rchandise. 
 

Q: Avra...Avraham, tell me , you me ntioned the ope
ra house. Is that where the orchestra in 
the ghetto played or...? 
 

A: No.  In Kovno they had a wonderful opera house.
  It was in the center 
of the city and they 
had excellent, excellent Lithuanian...Lithua
nian uh singers.  Al so one Jew was...a 
Jew...one of the ma in singers was a Jew, but 
the orchestra, the musicians mostly were 
Jews and part of them, those who were not kill
ed before entering the ghetto, they were in 

the ghetto.  First-class musicians.  For instan
ce, this soloist of the of the musicians, 
yes...he was in the ghetto.  A so
loist, violinist.  And severa
l others.  The doorma n at the 
uh Jewish committee offices were
 a first-class pianist.  We  didn't send them to work 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
59
because we wanted to to to save their hands
, their fingers, you see, but  he  was a doorma n 
and was very happy to be a doorma n.  You unders
tand?   Others were policemen, you see.  
They were such policemen like you were but th
ey...this was the way to keep to keep uh 
their fingers, you know, that not be entirely...and 
in addition they were certainly not used 
to hard labor, you see, and some  use...I can
 switch over...when I 
talk about the ______, I 
want to finish with regard to the to the fi
ght ____ and then small children were in danger 
of being killed in the first 
place because they don't ...so what
 did we do?   We arranged a 
so-called vegetable garden gua
rd of young children of the age 
of eight to twelve.  From 
the age of twelve they could already get a wo
rk and be laborers a
nd and a a card, a labor 
card which was absolutely vital in the ghett
o, but what would we do with the children 
from eight to twelve, so we organized this
.  They were a group that was called  ______, 
_____________...the the guards of the gardens.  We
 had only vegetable gardens, and the 
very _______ about about a hundred and yet they had a uniform, you se e, and they had 
an arm band and so in this way we c
ould...and these young...youngsters also wanted to 
eat, so they used to try, you see, first of a
ll uh when they were in the gardens and the 
gardens were along the ghetto...the ghetto fenc
e, so they also some ti me s...being small 
children, they used to squeeze through the ope...raise a fence.  One keeps the fence...two 

people comes from both sides.  He is a sma
ll child so he came thr
ough, dig a little bit in 
the earth, you see, and he went out and bri
ngs, sneaks in some  bread or some thing and 
and he ma ke s in the ghetto, you see, so even
 sma ll children were 
cautious of the danger 
of starvation and they have 
knowingly lent into danger of lif
e in order to get some  food.

Q: How about the kids that 
were under eight and twelve, th
e the children...what did they do 
during the day?   You know, the six year olds
 or five year olds 
or four year olds? 
 
A: Oh yes...well, you see, so uh fortunately... 
unfortunately from the beginning we were 
not...we were not conscious of the great da
nger of these childr en because we never 
thought that they can take children and kill th
em, but when the the aktion of the 4th of 
October, 1941, when they put on fire the cont
agious hospital in thesmall ghetto with the 
patients inside, with the uh doc
tors and with the personnel, 
me dical personnel, all of the 
them, they were put on fire and they lead...but 
before they put on fire this building, the 
adjacent building was a children's home, an or
phan's home, and there were approximately 
five, six hundred children so they took them
 out from the building in the broad...in the 
courtyard of the...of the contagious diseases 
hospital and were just plain put them...I can 

never forget the picture.  There were small ch
ildren and babies, just babies, in the in the 
orphan's homes so the Germans when they put them on the on the on the ground, on the 

ground, and they just kicked them from one side
 to the other side w
ith their with their 
boots, the Ge stapo me n.  People like beasts.  
They behaved just like beef...beasts.  They 
used to kick them...when the children laid, for 
instance, with their fa
ces up to to heaven, 
yes, so they kicked them, th
en turned down, and then again. 
 This was a just terrible, 
terrible, terrible sight to
 see it and then they took them from
 that courtyard 
straight to the 
9th Fortress and they killed them in the very
 same  day together with another thousand uh 
inma tes of the small ghetto, after they put on 
fi re the the the hosp
ital.  They did not 
let...our fireme n were very...wer
e the fire brigade in the ghe
tto...excellent fire...firemen 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
61
were trained years and they were
 ready to to to...but they didn'
t let them come near to the 
place, you see. There we re Lithuanian fire br
igades who came close to the close to the uh 
ghetto fence, but they came just to safeguard th
at the fire shouldn't come  over to the other 
side of the of the fence.  You understand?   And 
this is...so you see they we re just not to to 
to fight the fi re but to see that the fire shoul
dn't grow to the other side and uh this was one 
of the most tragic days and what...it is wort
hwhile me ntioning, in that very contagious 
diseases hospital, you see, we were...we 
didn't have so much space and so many 
hospitals, so part of this contagious dis
eases hospital served as a ma ternity where 
children...women gave birth to to childr
en.  This, of course, was absolutely 
against...contrary to the 
to the restrictions of of pregnancy and so on, so when they took 
out the uh the uh the uh the uh...they took out fr
om their beds ma ny sick people and they 
brought them in one place where they coul
dn't ___  for sure.  They shouldn't re ma in 
some ti me s in ____.  There was left some  part 
of the building, left
 after the ___, so in 
one...they they left...they didn'
t...they just pass by one 
room where two wome n were 
laying after giving birth to th
e child, to the babies, and the two babies were on, you know, 
on the window there is a...big window there is
 such a...you know, like let's say this is the 
window and here is such a small...a small woode n...wooden... 
 

Q: Like a ledge... 

 

A: Yes.  So at this two...there are the tw
o children, so when they came to control if 
some body was left in the room, so they saw th
e two wome n a nd they were about to take 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
62
them out, but then one of them saw the child
ren, so he...he came  near to the babies and 
they looked and they looked and they 
and they...all of a sudden, some  huma n...huma n 
feeling came perhaps in in in hi
s in his heart, you see, so he
 said to the other one, what do 
you think?   Shall we leave these two babies?  
 You see...and in silent they went out and 
they left  the two women with 
the two children.  I...I am telli
ng this to stress that even 
among the murderers we re single, very rare, 
very rare...but there were some ti me s people 
with human feelings and they behaved sd hum
an beings and not like beasts like all thei r 
their comr ades.  Being with the swastika a
nd over the Nazi, you know, the grey...the grey 
uniform with the with the swastika with all this...to look at 
them was...one got frightened, 
you see, but these me n, that they came back a
nd they looked at the faces of the baby, he 
couldn't withheld from being...they they 
commit...and these two wome n a nd these two 
babies were the only one that le
ft from from from that hospi
tal, you see, and this is...this 
is...we always reme mbe r  it. 
 

Q: Avraham, you brought 
Esther, the artist... 

 

A: I beg your pardon? 

 

Q: You brought Esther, the artist, to 
draw scenes from that hospital? 
 

A: Well...so so at that time ..
.at that time , when they liqui
dated the ghetto, the small ghetto, 
they took thousand me n from the ghetto and they 
liquidated to the 9th Fortress, so I didn't  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
63
have any _____ more in '42...it was...in '41 in
 the beginning I have to say prior to the 
aktions on on huma n beings, on life, they 
took...confiscated all the 
belongings and they 
were...when the ghetto inma tes were ordered under
 threat of death to 
give all their gold, 
their belongings, their silver, furs, _____, pos
t stamps, collections...whatever valuables, 
and there were two stations in the in the
...near the Jewish committee where the Jews ha d 
to bring bring all their bel
ongings and wherever they...while
 ma king the searches inside 
the houses, each other, and some ti mes on the sp
ot killing them and 
and this brought about 
the people to run and get rid of their gold, to ge
t ri d of their silver, to
 get rid of their of 
their of their furs, you see, so we didn't  have any cameras anymore.  If...in...on the 

____...it was in August.  The the big...the bi
g confiscation, the to
tal confiscation of 
whatever people had had with them.  Others di
gged it in the earth or some where and they 
didn't...like Mack (ph)...I'll think about them
 later, but the the overwhelming majority, 
they were left without a penny 
and without any valuable, clothi
ng or or furs or whatever 
it was, so I didn't have a camera anym
ore, and I thought it is absolutely 
possible...impossible that this 
event, that this side should 
not be some how eternalized for 
posterity, but this already...t
he ghetto, small ghetto was out of bounds.  It was cut off 
from from the ghetto.  I'm sorry I didn't take 
along with me  my docume nts.  I would have 
shown you.  So I went to to Esther _____, a
nd I told her, Esther, you must draw what 
rema ined from the burned hospital, so she said
 how can we come  in.  It is it is out of 
bounds, so I I went to the commandant of the 
ghetto and I told him that since it was it 
was October...in in Lithuania in October it is
 already cold and very cold and we had no 
firewood in the ghetto and what they used to
 give us, just like the hundred grams of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
64
bread, this was the same story with the with
 the firewood, so I told them in the small 
ghetto, some  fa milies left some  firewood.  Would 
he allow us to take out from this from 
these dwellings inside the sm
all ghetto, to take out the firewood?   So he he...and I don't 
reme mber that I mentioned it yester day that 
the commandant of the ghetto, mostly they 
were elderly me n and they were not so, 
you know, fanatic like this, so they had 
understanding...he had understanding for this 
and he tells me  alright, I give you two 
hours, two hours to go in into the into the...so I said I need a uh a wagon, you know, but I 
didn't need a wagon.  I wanted that Esther, so
 he he gave a wa gon and I took Esther and I 
went in inside there and we stood and we looked where would be the best position 

geographically for Esther _____, to the painter, to
 stand and to paint it,
 but to paint from 
outside would be would be very dangerous be
cause they could have killed us on the spot 

because all the time the sentries go around the ga
te...the the fence, so I decided that we 
should go inside a building and the adjacent bui
lding from the left side  of the burned 
hospital was a two-story house so we went into
 this story...two-story
 and we arrived on 
the second floor and Esther from the the 
window from which she could have a good look 
on the rema in...what remained from the hospital and she painted and she drawed and she 

draw and this is what she have ma de it, but 
all of a sudden when...as 
she paints she...and I 
am on the outlook...all of a sudden I hear some body went in in the first floor so I got 

frightened to death because if
 they would found us, Esther...
 probably it would have been 
the finish for her, and I was responsible.  
I'm the bad guy that brought her about her about 
it, you see, and I felt terrible, frightened to deat
h, so I went closer to 
the staircase in order 

to see who is there, so that when they hear
d the...my footsteps so they run out.  What 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
65
happened?   These were Lithua
nians who had...who came in just 
to to to to steal and to 
take away what the Jews have left, so you 
see this was also...and this ______ but to to 
learn the mo me nt of danger to death was 
always there and uh she has done it and, of 
course, I took her some  firewood from the house, from another house and be...behind the 
firewood I put the the drawings of Esther 
______ and we safe came back to the to the 
ghetto.  There was another place where I 
took Esther _____.  I don't know.  I think I 
me ntioned to you that the...wer
e the ____ of the Lithuanians in
 the...in Slobodka.  This is 
the very suburb where later was the ghetto, 
that on on the very beginning, on the...at the 
night of June 25th to the 26th, the Lit
huanians massacred thousand Jews in the 
Slobodka...in the Slobodka suburb.  They just we nt
 from street to street and one of the 
houses...I I...then I I'm always after to see wh
at it looks like, but they closed up the area 
and nobody could go in and and the and the houses  after they have been looted, they 

closed up with uh wooden blocks and uh and uh and plywood so you couldn't  go in inside 
the the the houses because it was locked fr
om ____.  Anyhow, I I went in with Esther 
_____ and one house that I knew was a a Zionistleader.  He was the director of the 

_______ in in Lithuania.  _____ was his name , a 
famous veteran Zionist.  His wife was a 
dentist, and I wanted to know what happene
d to him, so I took Esther ____ again and, 
you know, I am a sportsma n so for me  to to, you know, to to ____, that was not such a 

big problem, but for Esther _____, it was not easy.
  So first of all I had to to take off 
some  wooden...how do you call it
...the such uh they cl
osed the the doors... 
 

Q: Thepanels. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
66
 
A: Panels.  Yes.  Panels.  Board (ph) of 
panels...but they were on
ly only with nails, not 
very...not very steady, not very strong so I 
could easily take it off, you see , and we 
scurried (ph).  First of all I went in and 
then I ma de it broader so Esther _______ could 
go in and then I took it again, so from the out
side it was as as it was before before we 
climbed in and we climbed in in the house.  
Wha t  we have seen was a terrible, terrible 
thing.  There were three rooms.  In one room was  the head of ______ and his body was 

on the on the _____.  There was blood on the on the walls.  Uh you know, all the feathers 

from the from the from the from the beds a
nd from...it was full in in...and also with with 
with blood...the feathers from the ____ and fr
om the couches and so on.  It was just 
terrible to look at it, and th
at the second room was the uh dentist's...his wife was a dentist 
and there was the the, you know, the dentis
t's special equipment and this stool and 
she...the wife was slain on the on the on  theon the stool of the dentist and dead.  I I 
can't ...when she painted it, she painted the th
e the one room of of the _____ house and we 
have it in her in her album. 
 
Q: What was your reaction when you saw this? 

 

A: It was terrible.  It was just terrible but
 but but you you had no way out.  You had to...so so 
until until until Esther ____...you know, I had to 
calm her down and to calm myself down 
first of all, but I brought her in.  I'm r e spons
ible for her and she's there and she painted 
it...and she painted it.  And she cried and she 
cried and then she painted and cried again 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
67
and this was a terrible thing.  Look, ther
e was in the ____ where ____ were, I have a 
photo, one of my photos, of a yeshiva ma n on his ____, on his ______,on the 
______...______, and with his talis (ph) on hims el
f.  He _____ so killed, so he he 
rema ined on it, so this wa s one of the painti
ngs and there were ma ny other paintings like 
that that I went on in or der to
 produce visual evidence to what
 I have writ...I have written, 
because nobody would would...I said to myse
lf and I told it to
 myself...who would 
believe what I am writing.  It is out of hu ma n understanding and it is out of what any 

community in the world could think of.  A ba
rb...barbarism is not the 
right word for it.  
And...but I was lucky enough that Esther _____ 
and Joseph Schleslinger (ph), and then 
there was another...another
 uh...on the 11th of January, 1942, the German Gestapo 
ordered to the one area of the ghetto, the 
_____ area, to...they should vacate their their 
dwellings within four hours and whoever will
 be found in the in their dwelling in this 
area after the expires the four hours, you 
will be shot on the spot without any 
clarifications  and whatever will be rema in 
of the i r belongings will be confiscated.  They 
said, the Gestapo said that they need the ar
ea and these dwellings to settle the Jews who 
are to come  at this very day from Ge rmany 
and from Austria, five thousand Jews.  That 
area lived only three thousand, but they squeezed...so when we heard, we took it for 

granted that first of all five
 thousand Jews are comi ng to 
the ghetto and Dr. Elkes, the 
head of the Jewish Council, said we have to 
meet them as brothers, give them the feeling 
they are comi ng to brothers, so he ordered 
that the wome n should prepare hot coffee for 
them because the terrible cold...in January was the thirty...thi rty centigrades 

below...below uh below uh below...thirty below...
the most hard winter in the ghetto was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
68
in 1942.  Dr. Elkes himself stood all the day 
from the beginning whenever we we got 
word of that five thousand are to come  in 
the ghetto, he stood at the ma in gate with 
several people, and with wome n who were rea
dy to give them...offer them coffee.  He felt 
very much...and he he says I can understand 
the feeling that these people were taken out 
from the houses, from t he from the countries, and they don't know where they'r e being 
brought.  At least give them a 
greeting for...when they will have to cross the gate behind 
barbed wires, they should...barbed wires th
ey should know that they'r e comi ng with 
brothers.  So we...those inma tes from this area 
to be vacated in four hours didn't have any 
transportation.  They were not allowed to to 
use transportation,  horses or wagons, so they 
dragged, you know, in their hands, bundles on 
their on their shoulders.  They uh...some 
uh some  uh home  uh utensils like uh like uh 
for children to bath, you know, the...it wa s 
used to drag it and on the snow.  You understand
?   I I saw the the the 
the picture of all the 

people frightened to death to be in time  not 
to rema in there after the...it was just...I said 
this scene I must put on a dr
awing, and then I didn't  find 
Esther _____, so I run to...there 
was one young...the youngest painter in the ghett
o.  He was Schmidt.  Schmidt, Joseph 
Schmidt, but we called him _______, a a nickname  as _______, and when I came to 

_____'s home, I found him.  I was the happiest man.  I said ___ come  qui ck and take 

some  paint, some  pencils with you and paper. 
 We have to to to paint this...we have to 
rush to the ____ area, paint th
e exile, the exile of...the expulsion.  And when he didn't...he 
he he was not conscious of the of the ur
gency.  Every mi nute counts...I would say not 
mi nute...but every hour counts, and he slow
ly...I said _____, quick.  Have no time...I 

didn't...nothing.  So he he took another coat, of
 course, as it was very
 cold, and took some  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
69
paper and and and some  pen.  In addition to 
the pen and pencil, he took color paints.  I 
said what for does he need these color paints, 
but he didn't listen to me  at all and he took 
everything, put under his under his overcoat and 
bring just running.  It was far away from 
his...it was on the other side of the ghetto.  
Running we came to the s
ite and there I had to 
find a place where he could stand and ma ke hi
s pa intings that should not be seen by the 
Germans, not even before Jews.  You understa
nd?  And he stood in a certain place which 
he found...he found a place we thought for hi
m ____ and I stood on the outlook and then 
I called for two of our  underground...there 
were...everybody went to
 this area to help 
them take out...to help them.  Everybody tried 
to help them, so Esther took two of my 
known me mbers of the underground and said 
you, you just cover that his body it ___ that 
nobody should see him, you see, and I stood on the ___ and he painted and he painted 
and he painted and I told him, _____, quic
k, finish, ________.  Every mi nute can come  a 
Gestapo and then it it will finish not only fo
r your painting but it fini
sh then to you and to 
me , but he didn't give in and he painted and  
he painted and this is now one of the mo st 
characteristic paintings of the of the Holocau
st in Lithuania.  It
 is in my book, with 
colors, oil painting, so this was _______ and 
this was the the the liquidation of that 
quarter.  The Jews came from Ger many, but they
 were sent straight 
to the 9th Fortress 
and were killed the very same  day and the 
part, the area was cut off from the ghetto.   
Q: And the three... 

 

A: I beg your pardon. 

 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
70
Q: ...and the three thousand that were moved...where did they go? 
 

A: No.  They didn't...they cut off from the ghetto.  They had to to squeeze in in in the 
rema ining part of the ghetto.  You unders
tand?  And the tension was even higher and 
painful, more painful than it was because th
ree thousand had to s
queeze in in anyway 
____ of the ghetto.   
 

Q: How did you learn that the 
five thousand were taken to 
the fort and just killed? 
 

A: We have seen them.  You see, Dr. Elkes at
 the gate was waiting for their comi ng, and all 
day Dr. Elkes didn't drink even not cold water.
  He was in such shape, tense, waiting, 
expecting, and they didn't  come  and they 
didn't come .  In the afternoon, they were 
brought and you know, the way to the 9th Fortre
ss come s along...it's a half a kilome ter, 
half a mile, from the ghetto fence, up on the 
hill it goes, and you can see.  Everybody in 

the  ghetto could see and we saw them.  Th
ey came...these five thousand me n, and then 
how did I...we know?   As I told you, in the 
Gestapo building worked a group of Jewish 
inma tes from the ghetto in cleaning, in in 
_____, in in in in th
e cleaning the the the 
lavatories, in in uh ________ and all kinds of...so they, when they came  back, they came  

the next morning to work, they could see ma ny many suitcases and bundles with name s 

of from Berlin, from Frankfurt, the 
name  of the Jew...you know, the the Gestapo 
took...they looted their their belongings and 
they brought...you see, and they threw away 
the uh the suitcases and the bundles and you c
ould see the name s and addresses of the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
71
people who were brought in, so we were...there 
wa s no lot of doubt that this were the five 
thousand who were killed in the ve
ry same  day on the 9th Fortress. 
 
Q: So what the Gestapo did is 
they took their things?  They 
took things that they wanted? 
 

A: Always they take.  First of all, they take 
off the rings, the gold and then they take they 
count the valuables, and they put them in th
eir hip pockets.  They don't bring it to the  

Gestapo. You understand?   From the board wh
ere the suitcases, on th
e trucks...so we had 
always several si ze that are workers in that 
building uh used to work and uh this was also 
one day in the ghetto unexpected.  You neve
r knew what the next
 day will bring you.  
There is a very nice poetry, Russian langua
ge...what does you today or tomorrow bring 
upon us. ______________.  What expect us...wha t brings 
to us the next  day?  Will it be 
day of sorrow, of pain, or will it br ing to us a 
new hope, a new joy?   It 
is a very, very nice 
poet from a very famous  uh Russian poet.  We
 don't like the Soviet
s, but we like very 
much the poetry and their language and their 
literature.  I am telling you I I I was uh I 
was...I lived...Lithuania was under under thes
e Russian czars and I studied law, the 
Russian law, not the Bolshevik la
w.  Come  back to the ghetto. 
 

Q: So with that, I mean you never knew what
 the next day would bring. How did people 
keep their spirits to go on? 
 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
72
A: So so...you know, there were...there were...the
re were...there were
 various kinds of 
reactions.  There were people in the ghetto 
that didn't...they they thought ma ybe this is 
the last day so why not eat?   Why not drink, 
that people will ma na
ge to bring in, to 
smuggle in...we called them ______...the smugglers 
of the gate or the smugglers of the 
fence.   You see, _______, in Yiddish, ______, and smugglers, when they used to 
ma ke...they turned it into a trad
e and they used to ma ke big money.  They even got to eat 
meat and and butter and eggs.  Said let's eat.  Tomorrow we will not...we will not...even 

on the eve of the of the 28th of October, pe
ople were...most of the people were in tension 
and and didn't  know what is going to happen 
tomorrow.  Others thought this is the last 
day, so they used to concentrate in thei
r thoughts, in their mi nds.  Others took out 
everythi ng that they ha d and said they w
ill eat up everythi ng, not to leave for the 
Germans the next day anything.  You see?   It...l
ook...it's thirty thousand people.  It is not 
a a...you don't think by order.  You don't act 
as some body would expect you to act.  
Everyone in his own way.  You understand?   A
nd so there was a very very thin...a very 
thin group of people who ate in meat, in butter,
 in eggs, a very thin few...those were the 
smugglers, but they, of course, uh uh rescued th
eir...risked their life.  Some of them were 
killed.  You know, you can uh ma ke a _____ once,
 twice, but the third time you...a bullet 
come s and fi nish...finishes you.  You understa
nd?  For instance, Dr. Elkes and all 
those...he wa s close to starvation.  Although he
 was very...again and again offered by the 
smugglers, we'll bring you butter.  We 'll bri ng you this.  He never ac
cepted not a piece of 
bread.  He used to share with me  my my pi
ece of bread, you see, or offer me  his piece of 
bread, but he would never never have any c
onnections with smugglers which we thought 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
73
it's...the underground...it's the...what we are trying 
to fight, just to keep
 the standard of of 
huma n of huma n behavior, of Jewish heritage
, to keep alive even
 under these terrible 
circumstances of the ghetto, and this is only th
anks to Dr. Elkes and to those leaders who 
were known as communi ty leaders before the 
war and they were el
ected by...elected, and 
this was the difference, the big difference be
tween the ghetto of Kovno leadership and the 
leadership in other...in other ghettos. 
 
Q: Avraham, let me  ask you quickly...we had gone 
over to another story 
and I wanted to ask

A: ...circle that we used to hear 
what news what's  going on in the... 
 
A: ...so ma ny progroms and so ma ny ha rdships in
 various ____ inquisition in Spain and then 
in Russia and so on.  Uh this ____ no problem about it, but this was not only the ghetto in 
the  
public gatherings that we  tried to arrange, but in 
private talk day in, day 
out, the widows used to 
c o me  t o  me . . .  

 

Q: Hold on one second, Avraham.  I 'm s orry.  We 'r e just changing tapes now.  We 'll pick up

END OF TAPE 4, SIDE 2 
 

Q: OK, Avraham, we 'r e going to start withthe underground and the Zionist moveme nt, the 
Zionist resistance moveme nt. 
 Tell me  how that was established, what some  of your 
activities were, and who so
me  of the leaders were. 
 

A: Yes.  Now uh the the situation pr ior to our
 being incarcerated in 
the ghetto behind barbed 
wires, the uh terrible attacks and killings 
of uh Jews in the str
eets of Kovno, right after 
the outbr eak of the war until the the incarceration in the ghetto, called for immediate 

resistance because we ha d a...also even 
under the Soviet occupation, 1940, June 1940 to 
June 1941, we had also a clandestine Zionist...Zi
onist uh moveme nt or leadership let's say 
it was, but this is entirely different  char
acter.  While under the Bolsheviks it was our 
main aim to assist  the families economi cally.  
Of the leaders we were being arrest ed ri ght 
on the first days of occupation, they were  arre
sted.  They were take
n to Siberia.  Second, 
to try and ourselves tr
y and avoid our own exile to Siberi
a.  It was very clear that uh 
the...under the Soviet occupation, not only were 
we were able to to to ma intain our 
Hebrew schools, Hebrew education.  They
 closed up imme di ately.  They closed 
up...liquidated all the Jewish in
stitutions leave alone the Zi
onist parties 
and move me nt 
and so on, but what we had is a really in the very sense of the wor...of the word, to try 

and to keep away from arrest and to keep 
out hiding.  We  were hiding.  I, for instance, 
were were hiding from the mo ment when I was told my brother-in-law was not a Zionist.  

My sister, means my sister, she was religi
ous and Zionist-minded 
woma n and she was the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
79
oldest sister, ______ ______.  She didn't allow me to
 live in a pri...in a in a...somewhe re 
else but with her, to stay w
ith her all the years that I studi
ed at the University of Kovno 
law. Yes.  She was very much devoted.  Sh
e was Zionist and she wa
s religious.  To the 
contrary, my  my brother-in-law, her husba
nd Benjamin, a very decent, very honest and 
very fine person, he wasn't ...he was uh in the 
so-called...there was a moveme nt of Je wish 
left, Bundists (ph)... 
 
Q: Bundists... 

 

A: Bundists.  And he was a Bundist.  He...there 
was a Jewish Bundist paper in Lithuania, the 
the _______.  _____ was the name  of the Jewish paper which were the organ of the 

Bundists in in Lithuania. 
 
Q: So how was the Zionist resistance differe
nt than that ____?   You said they...they 
supported people economi cally.  Then how...? 
 
A: I I'll come  immediately.  And then we we
re assisting one another.  He told me ...my 
brother know this what I've told you but re
me mb er, it was...he told me , look Avraham, 
you're on the list to be exiled to 
Siberia, so just try to to 
to...from the surface...disappear.  
So I told him wait a mi nute.  I will sleep wi
th you.  He says what?   You'll sleep with 
me ...if they want to find you, you will...they will 
come to me.  They know that I am your 
brother-in-law and they know that...your sister. 
 So I finally tried hi ding in various places 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
80
in the outskirts.  I run away 
to Vilna (ph), to Vilna.  Yes
...which was then the capital of 
Lithuania, and in Vilna I f
ound out who...with whom could I make contact, also Zi onist 
leaders, but they themselves were hiding, so 
we are hiding together in a park, in a in a 
lane, you know, uh some where out...in the outskirts of the city, and it 
was an absolutely 
impossible situation.  You understand?   A
nd to the end, you know, I couldn't...couldn't 
see any other way out but to come  back to Kovno, and when I came back to Kovno, two 
days later... 
 

Q: Theinvasion... 

 

 

A: Theinvasion...Germa n...Germa n 
war break out and so as I sa
id yesterday, I went from 
the fr om the pot to the to the fi re.  The the resist ance in the ghetto or  even before we were 
incarcerated in the ghetto, was entirely of diffe
rent character and en
tirely of different 
dime nsions and entirely different aims  so uh 
when the historic and dramatic meeting or 
assembly of the Jewish...of the Jews...Jewis
h leadership of Kovno 
to elect a over-Juder 
(ph), a chief Jew, and this...and the committee, in the very same  place, in the very sa me 
school, former school, two  hours later we we held
 a meeting in another room of this very 
same  school for leaders of the various Zionist 
groups.  Uh there was the...a me mber of the 
left-wing ____ move me nt, pioneer m
ove me nt, who I recall ________, _______ and then 
there was the labor movement.  You had th
e labor move me nt, and then was the  ______ 
and then were the general Zionists. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
81
 
Q: Do you remember their name s?  

 

A: Oh of course.  They were my best friends, 
so to start with _____ Goldschmidt.  He is now 
Sa m Goldsmith, Saul Goldsmith in Chicago.  Yes.   Uh the second one was _____ Kohn 

from the labor.  By the way, this Saul Goldsmith was from the very left, uh ________.  

And is now quite a millionaire, you see, and uh the second one was ______.  Belkahn 

(ph).  Belkahn...he lives in New York.  He 
from the labor mo vement.  The...from the 
_______ were the head, the chairman of 
the _______ moveme nt in Lithuania, ________ 
or as I call him,  ______, who passed away 
in Israel two years ago, and uh myself 

representing the Zionists, general Zionist move me
nt.  Three or four.  Right after joined us 
a fifth one, very active.  This was _______, 
Issac _______.  He was mos t  uh instrumental 
because he was a pharmacy and the...was the 
head of the oldest pharmacy in the ghetto, 
and since we considered that the pharmacy
 is the most place that nobody will think of 
that there is any hidings or 
some  contra...contrary Nazi activ
ities, so we below the...below 
the the pharmacy where there was a cellar a
nd in this cellar we arranged uh to have 
one...to listen to a radio from abroad.  Th
e...it was the only..._______.  This is what you 
have from the...to to liste
n, you see.  _______ we used to go down the the the pharmacy 
in the cellar and listen to radio.  Mostly 
hims elf would listen but because each one was 
busy in certain tasks and then we used to 
come  fr equently...once a week, even some times 

more...but this was really top s
ecret.  Also for all various gr
oups.  I never told my ______ 
from general Zionists that we have a leader
ship of the uh of the for...of the underground 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
82
in the ghetto resist ance.  What I told them is 
that we have first of all, to be organized 
ourselves, keep together, be r
eady to oppose the Nazis.  For 
instance, after the 28th of 
October, we had a decision of the underg
round, of the all the the the underground, the 
Zionist underground was called ________ Kovno.  
_____ the the letters, 
the initials as 
_______.  ____ as you know, the Hebrew...in English to 
translate it is, in in
 in distress, in 
in in uh...not sulk.  You are in a very ha
rd position.  You cannot move.  You are 
surrounded and you are in in in in in a uh in
 a very bad situation, let's say...and uh the 
_____, we called _____ always to be on the alert, 
to tell us, to signal 
us whatever they 
know in their dwellings or in their working pl
aces, what they have heard and what they 
know, to bring us the news, so we used to c
oncentrate after the day 
of work when they 
used to come  back from the works from the pl
aces, they used to to report to us on what 
they have heard that day. 
 
Q: Where would you meet, Avraham?   W
ould you meet...be hidden some place...?   How 
ma ny of you would be...? 
 
A: We...we...first of all, there was only small,
 very small _____, four, five.  Not more.  Six 
was the ma ximu m, so we used to...we meet either in a a in a in one's dwelling or 

some where on the vegetable gardens as if we
 are working those vegetables.  Some times 
we meet in the center of the village because...or 
or  in the or in the cellar of the of the uh 
pharmacy.  Because for us was...we were cut o
ff of the outer world.  This was exactly the 
very meaning of the Germans by setting up the ghettos.  First of all to keep us behind 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
83
barbed wire.  We  cannot go out.  We  cannot
 have any contact.  We  didn't have 
telephones, and later when we had tele
phones, it was also for the...only for the 
inner...inner communication between the pol
...Jewish police and th
e and the and the 
German commando of t he ghetto for even...for 
his convenience, not for the convenience 
of the Jews.  Or there was a a telephone in th
e Jewish commi ttee, in the labor departme nt, 
and so on, for the convenience of the Germans,
 not for us.  But we knew to exploit also 
these.  For instance, the telephone...there 
was at the gate, there was a service police 
station at the at the ghetto gate, Jewish polic
e station.  For the other 
side, outer side, there 
was a German's and the Lithuanian's police. 
 Inside there was the Jewish police, so 
whatever...if...whenever some  top official of 
the Gestapo or of the We r macht or the stock 
commissar, entered the ghetto imme diatel y th
ey signal by phone to us.  In the Jewish 
committee it was myself.  In the labor, we 
had another ma n.  In the police, we had 
another ma n and this used to come  _
_________.  Imme diately...if there...for instance, 
when Roka came into the ghetto, we were...t
he the streets were 
cleaned up.  Everybody 
run away and then so we used first of a
ll together use or information on what is 
transpiring in the various places of work in 
the ghetto and what they have heard and there 
were rumors more than than facts, you s
ee, but even the rumors for us...we...not having 
any kind of communication with another city. 
 There were three ghe
ttos in Lithuania.  
The Kovno ghetto, the Vilna ghetto and the ___
_ ghetto, but there was no communication 
so the first work what the Zionist underg
round have done, to establish a communication 
between the Kovno ghetto underground 
and the Vilna ghetto underground. 
 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
84
Q: How did you do that?   What did you do? 
 

A: Oh, this is a good question.  You are a very 
intelligent interviewer,
 I will tell you.  So you 
see, there wa s a Jewish...Jewish worker 
group...worker...who worked at the railway  
station in Kovno, and we the the head of this 
group, usually a group of 
workers...in in the 
terminology of the ghetto it was a brigade...a 
brigade, and the head of the brigade was 
_____ Silverma n (ph), who was a me mber of the underground, so we called him and told 

him to listen.  You are working at the railwa
y station.  There are going trains day in, day 
out from Kovno to Vilna.  Try to bribe one
 of the workers of the of the railway...of 
the...of the...who are working on the train, ye
s, so as to get that you could send some  

letters from Kovno ghetto to  the leaders of 
the underground in the in the Vilna ghetto, 
whom we knew.  And this Silverma n succeeded 
in bribing the man who drive...the driver 
of the train...how do you 
call it...the driver of
 the train...the loco... 
 

Q: Conductor... 

 

A: What? 

 

Q: Conductor of the locomo tive.  You see?   
And first I reme mber he came, right, give 
me ...so we gave him ten letters.  Each one
 of us knew one or two from the Zionist, 
previous Zi onist leaders in the in the in Vilna.  For instance, I knew _____ ___ was from 

the youth Zionist general youth moveme nt, so I se
nt to him a letter.  
The others sent to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
85
their...to their respective ___ in Vilna and 
we and the same Silverman gave these ten 
letters.  Of course, it's  not easy to take out
 ten letters from the ghetto because if they 
would find...if they would check him on the date 
when he goes out as head of the brigade 
and finds the letters, it was 
the end of hi m and of all th
e brigade, so you you you had to 
be very, very careful.  But he succeeded and 
he and he he bribed this conductor of the 
locomotive, of the train, and uh he was supposed
 to give these to one of the underground 

in the _____ or ______. ______ was from the, you know, the name .  He was one of the 

leaders of the Vilna ghetto and the Gl aserma n 
(ph) was the leader 
of the ______, so each 
one sent to his ma n in Vilna, and luckily the 
next day, he brought lette
rs from the m.  This 
was some thing that opened our eyes and our
 mi nds and you couldn't know but of course 
this was...the  the letters were restricted to several lines only because... 
 

Q: What did they say? 
 
A: Yes.  So first of all, we are telling them 
in a in a in a very...in our own language to ma ke 
them understand that we are trying with them...sa ying that we are organized, that we are 

trying to keep ____ together, and from time 
to time we meet, and we are trying...we are 
trying to keep the the mood of ______ and give
 them the feeling they are...they are not 
alone.  They...its give them to renew the sens
e of belonging so that gives them also more 
security, mo re defense, that in case some th
ing happens, they know they have to...they...as 
ever a ma n to whom they can go and open 
their arms and their pains and and their 

problems and so on, and there were, believe
 me , everyone had a full heart and pains 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
86
hims elf or his fa mily or his parents, or his 
friends, and that we 
want to get a ______.  We 
didn't say it like that.  We want to ge
t from you a  _______.  You understand?   And we  
didn't have to put the more words in the in
 the few lines that we wrote because we 
were...had to be ready that it will be detained
 and then go and explain.  And so it was that 
we got first...the first contact with the 
with the Zionist underg
round in the ghetto of 
Vilna, and we developed later on also to send letters fr om families fr om the ghetto of 
Kovno to families in the ghetto of Vilna.   
 

Q: Avraham, tell me what those first letters 
from Vi lna that came to you...you told us what 
your letters were to th
em.  What we re those first letters to you...? 
 

A: First of all, he tells me, for instance, this is 
what he said.  First of 
all I am very pleased to 
hear that you survived, that you live, th
at you are among the living.  Second, I am the 
same ...I a m pleased to tell you 
that I and my wife  and my 
brother-in-law and my sister-
in-law and ____ and this, this and this is alrea
dy...this is in Siberia and this is there and 

this was killed.  The name s of the leaders,the former leaders, you see...this is what ____, 

and even ____ of who is and who is not, and 
believe me , this was most important.  You 
see?   And then uh in the next
 letters...already we started al
ways your problem...food or is 
the problem of labor, what 
are the the possibili
ties of uh of uh fight...____...we didn't say 
fight...____...you see.  We knew...we
 want to know...again I must say a...quote a Russian 
saying.  They say a ma n...a a a bird that is 
in distress knows exactly how to keep a mo st 
either shout or cry very aloud the form out 
express ourselves and tell what...what...what 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
87
is...what is their interfering or
 what is their desire, you see, so the situat
ion brought about 
to bring our news that we  wanted to to tr
ansfer to the...to the _____ in Vilna, was in a 
very, very ma sked vocabulary, and we  used to say the next time , ____ or ____, whatever 
it is, you see, and we used then the slang or 
just uh new words that wouldn't  mean to 
anything...to any...nothing to anybody but fo
r us it was understood _____ Gestapo we 
didn't me ntion the name  Gestapo would 
be in another form ____ of this. 
 

Q: Did you share information about the depor
tations or the liquidation of the ghettos? 
 

A: Of course.  Of course.  This was the firs
t thing which we have done, and we wanted for 
them to ___.  Then we wanted to know...certain family when they started to write, they 

wanted to know about their me mbers...there we
re certain families that pa rt of them were 

in the Vilna ghetto and part of them were in
 the Kovno ghetto.  For instance, my wife, her 
brother, two brothers were in 
Vilna, and this was the fi rst time that she learned that that 
he is alive while the other brot
her was killed, and th
is was the fi rst time, and the very first 
uh communications.  So when more more letter
s were sent and we 
had to distribute the 
letters to to the to the inma te
s of the ghetto, we used the...we had an office of statistics in 

the ghetto, admi nistration.  We  didn't speak 
about it but uh statistic
s.  We ...they wrote 
every birth and every passing away from the 
ghetto, every marriage.  We had marriage in 
the ghetto.  Life went on.  Of course, a good...t
here was a bar mitzvah in the ghetto and 
uh and and I want to tell you...I must tell it.  On
ce I was sitting in my 
offi ce in the Jewish 
committee and all of a sudden I got a call 
from t he workshop, big workshops in the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
88
ghetto.  We  had big workshops that worked
 eighteen hundred, mostly wome n who c ould 
not go out of work from outside the ghetto, a
nd there were a carpentr
y and tailorship and 
and plumbers and uh and uh and uh washing, 
cleaning...all for the German army, but 
we...and so so uh the German supervisor ofthe ghetto used to come  to the Jewish 
committee or he used to come  straight to th
e workshop.  There for...he liked very much to 

go to the workshop because he could order a su
it for himself, a pair of boots, from his 
wife he ordered dresses.  It didn't cost 
him money, you know, sent, so all of a sudden I

Miller is there.  Miller was the deputy ____ 
commissar who were at the supervision of 
the ghetto and when Miller says I should come

So on my way from the Jewish Committee to the ghetto workshops, I passed by a small 

lane, a street... it's not a street...it is a a... 
 
Q: Analley? 
 

A: Huh? 

 

Q: Analley? 

 

A: An alley.  Very tiny alley and one takes me  by the by the sleeve and he says, ___ come in

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234

not Haisidic.  In Lithuania, mostly...ninety-n
ine percent were not 
Haisidic...opposing, but  
this were several Haisidic.  One of them wa
s in the ghetto and he directs me , and I said 
_____, Miller is waiting for me  out in the in th
e workshop.  He doesn't  want to listen.  
First of all he says sit 
down.  We  have ____ today, and he __________,  you know.  It's  
unbelievable...it was something that incredib
le.  Sit down. You have to make the ____, 
_____________.  Be blest to God for sitting in th

A: I beg your pardon? 

 

Q: What's upsetting you? 

 

A: So finally he left me  off and I came to the uh to the uh to the... 

 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234

Q: Theworkshop? 
 

A: To the workshop and I'm (laughter) getti
ng hell.  He says, you dirty Jew, do as ___ 
German uh uh ______.  As I ______ from the party.  He was a party ma n.  I have to wait 

for you Jew _____.  Wh ere where have you been?   
I said Miller, I just fell because on the 
way I run and while running I fell 
and I got hurt in my in my le
g, so I had...I had to to to 
to...that's why I was late.  You see, I find so
me thing out but you see, in the most hard 
times of the ghetto, the spirit, the devotion, 
the heritage, it is _______ today and you have 

to the sa y the blessi ng ____ so you can say that you fulfilled the mitzvah (ph) of sitting in 

a ____ and ma ke the blessing, and this...my son 
is bar mitzvah, so I have to drink...it 

was...most certainly it wa s not vodka, but it 
was some thing of...there was...I certainly 
didn't care very much but I was overwhelmed of 
the spirit.  This is, my friend, part of the 
resistance.  It's nothing but revolt against the 
German order, strict order to press us, to 
dehumanize us.  We shouldn't think of bar m
itzvah and we shouldn't think of holy days, 
and we should think only only slavery, work, on 
the very hard work that we  should think 
only how to get anothe r piece of bread and not
 think of _____ and not think of holy days 
and not think of bar mitzvah and so forth and so
 on.  This is the day 
in, day out resistance 
of the common ma n, the inma tes inside the ghe
tto, and this is what kept them alive, 
because _____ is a great meaning.  _____ is when
 the...the Jews were in the desert and 
they had no place to live and they built tents a
nd they were lived forty years but they live 

in tents where they lived.  So we certainly 
can have ____ hope that one day to finish and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
91
this was what meant this _______ with the______.  And uh it it keep
s...it moves me  so 
innerly to the bottom of my h
eart when I  think of it.   
 
Q: We can stop now.  Do you wa nt some more water?   (Pause) 

 

A: But of course we had mu ch more serious 
things to do.  We ...the four of us or more 
precisely the five of us, the leaders 
of the underground, before they found us,  
__________________ leadership, we ma de a final deci
sion...after the 28th of October, no 
more respond to orders of concentrating on 
one place of all the...of 
the all the ghetto or 
not even part of it.  No more.  And to resi
st, to oppose and really it happened so that I 
think a month or six weeks afterwards, ther
e was the order to report on the very same  
square.  They need five hundred workers to 
be sent to Riga (ph)
, from the Kovno ghetto 
to the Riga ghetto.   We  believed no more 
what they say because they said the five 
hundred, they were to to the archive and they we
re killed.  They said 
they need to to to 
ma ke order to divide between those who get mor e  bread and those who get less bread, 

and they killed ten thousand so this ___ th
at we ha d no confidence whatsoever and we 
ma de up our  mi nds no more response to...and then
 they tried...they started to grab people 
from the street, and they could grab three 
hundred because most of the people from the 
ghetto were at work outsi de the ghetto and when they didn't succeed in getting the 

people, so they took these thre
e hundred and brought them to the place, to the democratic 
square.  I went there and saw the sight.  At
 that time  there was _____ and the supervisor 
of the ghetto in ______.  He was a mass murderer
, and he...all of a sudden I hear that he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
92
says ma ybe those will want to volunteer to wa
lk to walk to Riga should make five steps 
ahead, and I was sure nobody will will go, but 
there were five who stepped ahead, and 
finally I disclosed that these five were insa
ne or very...not insane 
but crazy people.  For 
instance, I...one of them was a for mer high o
fficer of the Lithuanian army  and I thought 
what what..._______ was his name ...so I said _____, why did you volunteer?   Do you 
know...are you sure that you want to to work
 in Riga?   Don't you know what happened 
with the five hundred.  He says he's ____.  Kovno alone must know that I am a crazy 

ma n.  _____.  Let also Ri ga know that I am _____ and this only showed you who you are 

talking with, and also this type of people we
re in the ghetto.  Now 
this was one thing.  
Fir...second, for...when Elkes was going in to
wn to meet the chief of the Gestapo, I 
always tried to escort him...f
rom a distance, of course, just in case some thing happens.  
Now we...we...our clandestine uh uh 
_____ that lasted for five m
onths and then they were 
caught and the ma n, ______ was put in the Gesta
po.  He was always almost killed.  They 
arrested the the the ma in clerks in the Jewish
 Committee...first of a
ll the secretary of the 
Jewish Committee, Berenstein 
(ph).  He had not the slight
est idea because I have done 
nothing.  They arrested the chief of the sta
tistic bureau although he had no idea but his 
assistant deputy.  They arrested the ma in 
uh the ma in uh clerk _____ of the of the office 
of the altestenrat.  They had not the slightes
t idea but Elkes turned heaven to earth and 
earth to heaven until he got them free.  You 
see, and this was...but he was not allowed to 
be any more the secretary of the of the Jewi
sh committee and so I became the secretary in 
May '42.  Then when we had in course of our
 correspondence we were told that they have 
partisan groups in the fo
rests around Vilna and this wa
s far behind...from Kovno more 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
93
than a hundred kilome ters, and that they will 
be ready to assi st if we send a group to 
those forests so they should come  to Viln
a and from Vilna they...so we had a contact and 
then we started very seriously in tr
aining our mo veme nt, our Zionist underground 
move me nt, in in uh weapons and wehad among our _____ two officers who were 
officers in the Lithuanian army and were very
 well-trained in in in ammuni tion, and they 
were the instructors that instructed these sm
all groups, of course, in
 two, in three...not in 
always in the same  place.  Always in some
 other place.  You understand?  And they...I 

think I told you yesterday that the first gun 
that we bought was in 1941 in the beginning 
when when the ______, the teacher...ma ster of the Hebrew school and _____, a lawyer 

from Charlotte (ph), that I knew them ve
ry well before...they came to me and said 
we'll...we have a possibility to buy a gun.  
Could you provide the money for it?  And I 
went to Garfunkle, the  Deputy and he said what are you talking about.  It will be a 

terrible risk for all the ghetto.  So I didn't gi
ve in.  I went to Dr. 
Elkes.  Dr. Elkes didn't 
say another word.  He says go...go to the treasur er and tell him that I ordered to give the 

money uh to to to _____ yes, and _____ and th
is was the first gun we had in the ghetto, 
but this real ly was the fi rst but
 not the last one.  And then, l
ittle by little, we used to try 
and how can we bring in weapons to the ghett
o.  So first of all, ______ worked in ma ny 
places, workshops where they had...especially 
thos e who...to repair Germa n weapons in 
the in German units, to repair weapons, so 
he is planning to stea
l and and how did they 
steal?  For instance, they were about thirty 
or forty people working in that place where 
they...you know, where the ammunition stores and the Germans, for them it was a uh a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
94
just a lost uh let the Jews try to repair it, so 
each one of them used to take a part of a gun 
in the pocket, and when they used
 to come  to the ghetto, they... 
 
Q: Putittogether. 

 

A: But to pass with a part of it is also...i
t was not so...believe me , it was not so easy.  
Unfortunately, one of our best me n was caught
 with a weapon.  He...he dared to take a 
weapon himself home, a nd they thrash (ph) hi
m and they killed him on the spot.  So we 
paid very high price, very, very high price,
 but uh when the...yes...and now I want...when 
the first group of the Zioni
st underground was ready to go to the woods, and we knew 
that there will be the...yes...and we knew that 
there was a ____ from the Soviet Union in 
the woods, a top uh officer of the Red  Ar my 
who trained them and who s upervised them, 
so we knew that they are going in a pl ace wh
ere there will be a communist surrounding 
and there will be also ma ny non-Jews.  It was 
very important for me  that they in their 
leisure time  could have talks about Zionism
, about  ____ Israel, about the events in 
Jewish history, sing Palestine songs, so I 
came to some  let's say understanding...we didn't 
sign any contract... with the the communist lead
er in the ghetto who later as I said they 
had also their own underground.  I said look 
Heim (ph)...he was a very...he he was an 
idealist.  He was a communist, but
 he was also one of the circle
, of the cultural circle that 
we me t once in two weeks, you see.  He was 
also a writer, so I 
tell him, Heim, I a m 
sending...we are  sending the Zionists, first Zi
onist group to the part
isan woods.  I want 
you to to see to it that in thei
r leisure time they could sit t
ogether and hold conversations.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
95
When there is a real Je wish holiday, they c
ould just ma rk it.  They would sing Hebrew 
songs and they could tell each another, so he says Avraham, of course, of course.  We  are 
want to convert them to communis m.  This is
 what he said.  He was a very honest ma n 
and I believed every word that he told me  because  he was a ve ry, very honest man.  But 

fortunately they came to the to the Vilna ghe
tto.  From there they brought them to the 

forest, but then a month later I got word that
 they...not they were to me ntion Hebrew and 
not a song of ____ Israel, and not me ntion _____ 
Israel, leave alone prayers and so on.  
You understand?   And I was very mu ch uh disa
ppointed.  Yes.  We
...when the...when in 
1943 when the the communists raised also and a
nd organized their their resistance in the 
ghetto, aided by Heim _____, so we ma de an agr
eement a mong us to join forces.  For the 
Germans a Jew is a Jew, whether he is a comm
uni st or whether it is 
religious or whether 
it is combat or whether...whatever it is, so 
uh we had a uh joint command.  Two from the 

Zionist underground and two from the communi
st underground.  I t
ogether with three 
______ represented the Zionist underground in the 
joint command, but after this incident, 
I said I'm...I know it's not you but we'll...I
 know you cannot do anything about it but I 

joined a communist...a command joint with 
communists.  I I I resign.  I cannot...it's 
against my my concept of life. 
 I am a Zionist from early year
s, and then came  in...instead 
of me ca me in ______ from the the pharmacist. 
 See.  There were problems.  There were 
problems.  They ___ their own problems.  Th
ere were the problem of _____ to to...when 
they when they went a group of thirty, forty, 
yet to a woods, they had to have clothes.  
They had to have overcoats.  They had to 
have everything.  And how did we do it?   We 
had the Jewish workshops in the ghetto, the 
big workshops in the ghetto, so we used to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
96
send them to work there.  Those who were the first to go to the woods, they should go 
and work in the place where they repa ir the Ge
rman uniforms, see, and then they used to 

adjust to ____.  Also, we needed German unifor ms just to...you know, as a ma sk so there 

they used to take, to measure (laughter) a
nd not plainly fabricated
 but to measure.  
Everyone was equipped with everything.  We  just
 stole from the German s t ores and from 

the German repair and it worked very good. 
 The...unfortunately, the the main ma n who 
led the groups from the Kovno ghetto to the Vi
lna ghetto to the forest
 was the leader of 
the communist ________ and uh he used to to dress himself as a as a We rmacht offic e r, 

you see, with the all equipment and he came 
to take a group out of
 the ghetto, all the 
partisans, and we hired...was a truck and theand the driver wa s also dressed in German 

uniform, so that they came into the ghett
o.  There was at the ghetto gate there was 
_______. 
 
Q: How did you get a truck? 
 

A: What? 

 

Q: How did you get a truck? 

 

A: Oh, for money you get everything.  You see?   
So we we had the money.  I want to tell 
you...in the ghetto ______ I perhaps the only Jewish
 commi ttee that worked together with 
the underground.  They helped th
em.  They didn't work togeth
er but they helped them.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
97
And they...for reasons once so he he was...I want 
to finish with him.  So he used to take 
the lead and bring them t o the forest and come
 ba ck.  It took him, of course, a week, two 
weeks, so he used to were a German officer. 
 The driver is a German and here were the 
Jews, workers, so they take...went through 
clearly through the gate, mounted the uh the 
truck and we nt to to the for...to the woods. 
 Some...one day in a such movements, I was 
going to the city with a permit because as 
the secretary of the Jewish committee, but 
Heim _____, the head of the all the communists, 
he used to go in clandestine.  He had 

with him a gun always in in the pocket and 
one day he was caught by the Germans, and 
he run away from the m.  In one ______ he jump  from one place to the other one and 

finally they caught him and they brought him to
 the to the Gestapo.  He did not disclose 

his identity.  He never said that he was fr
om the ghetto even.  Y
ou understand?   Caught.  
And nothing came out of all _____.  He was kille
d and this is...he he died as a hero, 
fighting with his gun against the Germans, in
 town.  So this is...gives you...I can...I can 
speak about the underground as much as you wa
nt but one...one thing I want to say about 
the part of the Jewish committee in the unde
rground.  One...we didn't have the money to 

to to rent a truck.  We  didn't find the...the
 guy...so we came  to the ____ to send a group to 

the woods, so I came to to the...Dr. Elkes and I told him, look we need to send out a 

group of twenty-five and would you permit us 
to use the wagons...there were wagons in 
the ghetto...to bring firewood, to bring uh all kind
s of supplies from outside to the ghetto.  
They will go in the morning and they'll come  in the evening, the wagons, so we took five 

wagons...three wagons...excuse me .  Three wa...five
...five, of course, and they went out 
and they didn't  come  back in the evening and they didn't come back the next morning and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
98
they didn't come  the next  evening.  It wa
s a terrible...because where are the wagons?   
Why don't  they fulfill...why don't they come  to
 to town to take the bread, the flour, the 
firewood.  It was a me ss, so Elkes said th
at they uh the some thing happened after 
apparently the the wagons afte
r the horses are not well, all kinds of ____, and then only at 
the...well, we ll, look...if it would be disclosed th
ey all, the altestenrat would be killed but 
now no excuse whatsoever, no pardon and we
 didn't sleep the nights.  ______ from the 
____, from the leadership of the partisans and my
self especially because we were in close 
contact with the with the Jewish committee 
and because of the relationship between me 
and Dr. Elkes and he agreed to do it, so I ha
d sleepless nights.  Don't...don't envy me .  In 
what a position I was these three days.  Terri
ble.  And we were on the outlook...they were 
on the outlook and far away we sent out
side the ghetto at 
the bridge that 
contact...connects with the Kovno and the 
and the Slobodka uh and the Slobodka suburb 
just to see ma y...if they they are there or 
some thing happened to them.  We didn't know 
what happened.  Maybe they were caught.   
And only after we  felt...they...after mi dnight 
they came back worn out, torn out terribl y because they...it wa s not a journey to go...you 
have to...you have to stop certain places wh
en you see a German uh...let's say on the road 
a German squad is going or a Lithuanian par
tisan or whatever, so that's  why it took them 
very much...because they were succeeded in hi di ng on on crucial mo me nts on the on the 

road, and that's  why it took three days that 
took us out the the all 
all inside...what went 
inside went outside and you know
, there were two rabbis in th
e in the...I me ntioned Rabbi 
Schumuckler and Rabbi ______.  They really
 went and prayed in the synagogue 
especially for __________.  You see?  So this was a very...nothing ____ at all.  Not ____.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
99
And I I must  in two words also to me ntion, 
we had the confiscation of books which was a 
terrible...it was aktion not of me n but
 of books, but books.  We are the _____. 
 
Q: When did that happen? 

 

A: It happened in Februa
ry 1942.  There came a special envoy from Rosenberg _________.  
Rosenberg was the mi nister for the occupied 
territories and he was the ma n that ordered 
that all books, all printed ma teri
al that are in the ghetto s
hould be confiscated and taken 
out and sent to Germany, so uh when th
ey came uh to from the Rosenberg _____, Dr. 
Behnker (ph)...it was in '42.  I reme mber it until
 today.  I'll reme mber it to the rest of my 

life.  This Dr . Behnker who ca me  to the ghetto and he came to the Jewish committee and 

said all books should be...and we should writ
e announcement all over th
e ghetto that they 
should bring in certain places, concentrate...conc
entration places to bring the books to be 
deliver ed to the to the Germans, and all the 
wagons of the ghetto were mobilized to bring 
the books from the various parts of the ghetto to
 the to be handed over to the Germans, so 
in the underground, ______, we decided the very...mo
st valuable books we want to to to 
rescue, so we  mobilized the teachers whic
h will accompany the wagons and take out 
from the wagons valuable books that they consid
er of historic value 
_____ and put it in a 
separate wagon which was accomp anied and th
ey would...little children...the..you know, 
the _____, the me ssengers, so they we re not...
and you see, and they...and this the wagon 
where they stood, took these wagons and they us
ed to send it to...bring it to some  hiding 
place for us.  I knew that the the yeshiva 
______ had a very bi g library and needless to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
100
say for hundreds of years, so I went to the to the to the head of the yeshiva, Rabbi ____ 
and I told him, Rabbi _____, you know that there is an order for the Germans to deliver 

all the books and uh we are trying to rescue
 the most important books so may I ask you 
please, pick up to take out from your  lib
rary...there were about thirty thousand 

volumes...thirty thousand volumes of the Ye
shiva library for ag
es...take out the books, 
valuable books... 
 

END OF TAPE  5  

 

A: ...so he says brother, what
 are you talking about?   All the 
books of the yeshiva are very 
important, the most i mportant.  So I said, 
I was myself in the ye
shiva in my young days 
and I know that even in the yeshiva there are 
books more valuable a
nd less valuable.  We  
have to rescue what we can.  We  ca nnot 
ask the thirty thousa
nd, but we can rescue 
perhaps five hundred or six hundred.  _________.  So he says...he says _____ we will 

hide ourselves.  We  know how to hide.  If you hide them, they will get our books.  I 

didn't succeed to persuade him...his stubbor
nness, you know, and the religious Jews, the 
more they are religious, the more they ar
e stubborn, and you cannot fight in the common 
language.  There is no sense.  Common sense.  So I told him,  Rabbi ____, I am very sorry 

that you don't  take advantage of the opportuni
ty of rescuing at least the most important 
books we have.  Go home.  Go home .  D
on't worr y about  our books.  We  will worry 
ourselves.  We will rescue all our books, not th
e part of it.  The next day was the was the 
uh the books had to be delivered and from 
all parts of the ghetto the wagons took books 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
101
and there is...one of the pictur

and Dr. Behnker from the Rosenberg ________ and 
before, the day before, he wanted me  
to show him the the ______ from the ghetto, the 
most important thing what is can be seen 
in the ghetto, the sights

there wa s a synagogue that one day 
the Germans ordered... 
 
Q: OK.  Hold on Avraham.  We 'r e going to pi
ck up.  They have to
 change tapes again. 
 

A: Good. 

 

Q: OK.  Uh let's pick up with the stor
y where we left off on the books and the... 

 
A: Yes.  So uh the Germans ordered that all...to bring all  cats and hounds in from the ghetto 
into one Jewish ancient synagogue, the most ancient synagogue in Slobodka, and bring 
all the cats so people brought every cat ____.  
What did the Germans  do?   When all the 
cats and and hounds were there in the synagogue
, they killed them, but they didn't allow 
to take out the the corpses of the of th
e of the killed cats and hounds, just to ma ke 
mi serable the holy place of Jews, the holy...holy 
sanctuary of the of the Jews.  And one 
of...just to to to cause terrible pain, because
 for us a synagogue is a holy place and to 

bring in in itself cats and...is 
already a a crime but to kill th
e cats, the cats and hounds and 
leave them a r ound them stinking for months
 and months...this was a thing that we 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
102
couldn't...for for miles you hear
 the stink so he...when he told me  that he wants me  to 
bring him, to show him the most valuable 
and sighting of the ghetto, I took him to the 
synagogue and I and when I came to the entran
ce of the synagogue, he orders me  that I 
should go in front.  So I said no, uh Mr...Dr. 
Behnker. I cannot go in.  The entrance is 
free.  You can go and see what for yourself
, and I didn't go in and regardless of his 
command and you know, this is...it's a me ss.  He he could kill me  on the spot but I said 
no, here I stay.  The doors are open.  Everyt
hing is open and you can see for yourself and 
when we...when he went out, and this is a ma n 
of culture...this is a ma
n of of of Ger man 
culture from Berlin which is...
it's the capital of world culture, so he understood.  He says 
yeah.  ______.  Yes, I understand you.  I am...h
e understands me .  He told...Dr. Behnker 
told...said to me  when he went out from th
e synagogue, he says he understands me  why I 
didn't...why I couldn't go in.  So then the next
 day we...I was sitting with Dr . Elkes in the 
Jewish Committee.  Only Dr. Elkes was...it wa
s in the morning.  It was ten o'clock, and

Q: ....you own escape? 
 

A: Right before that...before I must tell you a
bout the about the the Mack story.  Mack was 
one...a regular boy in the ghetto. 
 He was a jeweler.  When 
all people in the ghetto leave 
him all their gold and silver and money and va
luables, he digged a...below the earth and 
he rema ined with two kilos of gold and coins an
d silver and whatever it is, and he tried to 
escape from the ghetto. He was in a contact w
ith a Lithuanian group that promised him to 
take him through the Baltic Sea to Sweden, a
nd paid a lot of money, but they had to go 
through the ghetto, so he tried...he and another
...another friend of hi m, to go through the 
barbed wire.  They cut down the barbed wire, he...Mack...but what...he was a very 

short...uh you couldn't see from 
afar, you see...how do you call it... 
 

Q: You couldn't see from...short-sighted? 
 
A: Short-sided, yes.  So he ca
ught...cut the barbed wi re and they
 went out.  He just jumpe d 
on the commander of the ghetto, Fl eishma n. 
 And he...even that and this is not 
enough...he took out a gun from his...from his 
pocket and says, commandant, get away 
from here.  Otherwise I will...I will shoot.  He
 didn't finish the word and the and the and 
the commander had already his hand on his 
gun and everything and it was a me ss in all 

the ghetto.  Immediately all the ghetto was 
surrounded by ma c hine, you know, from the 
Gestapo and military and police and whatever
 you say.  The Germans br ought him to the 
to the commander of the ghetto and they want
ed him to disclose...the other one who was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234
111
with him, he retreated inside the ghetto, di
sappeared.  And they wanted from Mack...the 
name  of the ma n was Mack...and they wanted 
from Mack that he should disclose who 
was the second ma n that uh that retreated, that
 disappeared.  They beat him up.  It was 
just terrible.  When when we came...s o what di
d they do?   They didn't succeed in in in in 
getting the na me  so they so they called th
e...as hostages took the the Jewish committee, 
this Garfunkle and Goldberg and Dr. Elkes 
was sick in bed for...he had a very hard 
rheuma tism,  so so the secretary should come , 
so they took me , so the three of us ca me , 
were brought and came here, were brought to 
the to the to the 
uh commander of the 
ghetto and the first thing that they wanted
 us that we should influence, impose upon 
Mack that he should disclose who the second wa
s.  We  had an iron rule in the ghetto...not 
one Jew be handed over to the Germans by us.  So we keep quiet.  When I saw Mack in 
the...in the commander's... co
mmandant's office, you couldn't recognize a person because 

all hi s head was a piece of of 
flesh.  You hardly could see his eyes, so wa s he beat en, and 
mi nd you, Mack was not a me mber  of the underg
round, not of the Zionist and not of the 
Communists.  He was just a plain ma n, but he
 did not disclose...more they beaten and 
beaten and beaten and he didn't ope
n his mouth, so then they said... 
 
Q: Avraham, we have to stop here. 
 I'm sorry.  We 'll have to pick up...

Q: Avraham, tell me , if you would, about your
 escape from Kovno, yours and Pnina's, and 
the last testament of of Elkes, of Dr. Elkes. 
 

A: That's right.  Well, I'm talking...we are talk
ing about the escape from the ghetto and not 
from Kovno.  It is two different things.  We ll,
 as I already me ntioned before, I was one of 
the four founders of the Zionist undergroundmo veme nt whi c h was a resistance, and we 

we...there prepared in the very end when 
the when the ghetto is...before liquidating the 
ghetto, the leaders will escape to the woods, 
to the partisan groups, and this was the 
planning.  It was a ma tter of timing when s
hould we escape from the ghetto and this wa s 
a very important question...which one of the f
our leaders of the Zionist uh resistance 
movement were all the positions in the ghetto 
life, so it wasn't  just a matter of once a 
decision.  It had to be a decision with th
e consent of the chairman of the Jewish 
committee and so on.  But it happened so as I also told you that I was very much engaged 

in this looking and finding a place of hiding for ____ which was then seve n years.  When 

I found such a place and the lege ndary escap
e of ______ from the ghetto, she fell very ill 
and when she came into the farm of hiding, it 
was absolutely necessary that Pnina should 
go there at least for a week becau
se we couldn't bring a doctor. 
 

Q: OK.  Let me ...let me  back up and if you c
ould tell us on tape that  ________ was Pnina's 
daughter, just so we have it a
nd and how she got to the farm. 
 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0234

A: Yes, yes.  Well...well, ______...Pnina's  fi
rst husband was killed, was murdered by the 
Lithuanians...they already in th
e first days of the outbreak 
of the war and Pnina went ___ 
to the ghetto with a small child of five y
ears, her name  ______...____ less than five years, 
and she could bring nothi ng with her from 
home because her apartment in...a Jewish 
apartment, a most elegant apartment in K
ovno, was taken over by German generals and 
they didn't let her in when she was taken to 
prison.  All...the all th
e family was taken to 
prison. There they were separa
ted.  Her husband separated... 
 
Q: We have all that.  We have all th
at from...we have all that from Pnina. 
 

Q: Anyhow, so she rema ined in the ghetto alone with ____ and uh we uh she's...Pnina was 
uh hiding my uh my entries in the diary and 
my c ollection of documents.  I felt I must 
help uh ____, Pnina in hiding...finding a address 
for ____, to cut a long story short.  Uh it 
was very difficult but in ____ I I I succeeded in
 finding a contact with a priest who found 
a place for her hidi ng and when I took her out from the ghetto, three times I tried and I 

didn't succeed.  It was...it failed.  There al
ways were a a Gesta
po officer or some body 
else that we we...our plans failed.  On the th
ird time I succeeded in taki ng her out of the 
ghetto, but in the two first times of trying, it wa
s winter.  It was cold so she got a cold.  
She got a cold and when she finally reached 
the farm, forty-four kilome ters away from 
Kovno...it's about eighty miles...excuse me , about
 forty miles...she was entirely sick,  
______.  And only by accident I...it's not here in
 the places...by accident  got to know that 
she is ill in the farm, and I immediately went 
to the priest and I to
ld him we must uh...we 
must give medical help _________.  No docto
r can be...can be brought to ____ to cure

her.  At least Pnina would go, take along with 
her me dicine.  We had 
excellent doctors in 
the ghetto and she took along and the priest
 was very opposing it because it was the 
danger.  Anyhow, I said it would have meant 
nothing if she would die, ____, from fr om 
illness.  It's the same we didn't do nothing, so
 she was there but instead of being there a 
week, Pnina stayed there four montheses.  A
nd she worked there in the farm in all works 
as was she was considered as a as a relative,
 far relative fr om town that she run away 
from Kovno from bomb ardments and from 
the war, but she was for all things and 
purposes worked with the with the family 
and she got very well acquainted with them 
and uh it was a woma n, a widow whose husband, th
e boss of the farm, fel l  from a from a 
thunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried 
in in in this far m, and the widow was a 
very good-hearted, that was very 
religious, and that's  why the pr
iest could talk her in that 
she should take the child for hiding and uh a
nd uh then she wa s really happy that Pnina 
came because she didn't know what to...______ was crying all the time...Momma, 
Momma...and uh I...as I said she lived there in
stead of a week, she stood there for about 
four, five months and then she was ac
quainted there...one...one...the the woma n, the 
widow had three daughters and one son.  The 
son was about eighteen 
years, but because 
his father wa s dead so he was the head of the family and around the farm and he couldn't 
attend school.  He was illiterate
 and he very much wanted to
 learn to write and to ready, 
so Pnina told him, look..._____ was his name
...______, I have a ma n.  He  is a lawyer and 

he is a educated ma n and he will edu...educate you in writing Lithuanian and uh... 
 

Q: Did this ma n...did this young ma n...you helped him.
  We...we do have to cut it a bit.  Did 
you help him?   Did he help you escape?

A: And then he was the one who who a greedthat to to...that I should be brought and he 
himself prepared a special hidi ng place fo
r me inside the the far m, faraway from 
everyone, and so I came to the farm.  So one day I was surprised by from the priest for 

me  that a wagon will be waiting for for me  on the 23rd of February, 1944, for the farm.  I 

was, as I said, prepared to go for the woods 
but not for the farm, but since I got such a a 
word from Pnina so it was nothing doing, so I had to escape from the ghetto.  The night 

before...so I told...of course, I told Dr. Elkes a
bout my plans, that I have to escape from 
the ghetto, and the the last night 
I spent in the house, in the 
tiny dwelling of Dr. Elkes, the 
head of the community, and his deputy Garf
unkle and Mrs. Elkes which was a lady in the 
very full sense of the word.  Just a lady, and th
e two people, I disclosed to them and I told 
them that my...the hidi ng place of the five 
crates of my diary and collection and they 
should know where it is but Garfunkle, the de
puty, said ____, you cannot do it.  It is 
already no ghetto.  It's already a concen
tration camp.  And you are going to commit 

suicide.  Wh o can escape now from t he ghe
tto?  And how wi ll you ma ke the fifty-four 
kilome ters?   I beg of you, don't do it.  It is te
rrible.  It's dangerous.  Don't you know the 
case of Mack.  Mack was the one who was ca
ught...they caught at th
e at the...when he 
tried to to escape through the 
barbed wire.  He was hanged p
ublicly.    Don't you know it?   
You were there at night, the whole night in the 
Gestapo together with hi m in the ce ll.  But 
Dr. Elkes said go.  If you would be my s
on, I would tell you go because you are the only 

one who know best what expired in the ghe
tto.  You kept a diary and you have a 
collection and documentation and it is
...you have a mi ssion to go and bring the 
knowledge to the world, to the outer world 
that it shall rema in to the future

generations...the Germans digged out the corpses 
of the sixty thousand that were killed in 
the 9th Fortress, so that there rema in no signof it.  That's why...that's why I think...I'm 
sure you have  courage.  You have  knowledge.  You have the persistence and you will 

succeed I'm sure about it, so uh in order to
 encour age me mor e, he took out from his 
drawer his last will
.  His two children...a son, Prof...now 
Professor Elkes, and a daughter 
Sarah, were studying in London and he
 says here is my last will.  Give  it to my children.  
I rely upon you.  You...your...your wisdom and your
 courage and I...what you have done 
in the ghetto for the three years, you have
