LONIA MOSAK 
July 17, 1990 
 
Q: Would you tell me  your name  please? 
 

A: LoniaMosak. 

 

Q: Where were you born? 

 

A: I was born in Ciechanow, Poland. 

 

Q: When? 

 

A: In July 20, 1922. 

 

Q: Tell me  about your parents and your fa mily? 

 

A: Well, my husband...my father 
was a sign-maker. I managed to
 finish school before the 
war, 1926. Yes. Then I went to learn a profession. 

 

Q: Let's see. Before you jump to 1933, your fa
ther was a signmaker. Tell me, did you have 
brothers and sisters? 

 

A:  Yes. Yes. I have...I have three brothers. 
One died before the wa r and one was taken in 
Auschwitz in a selection, and one went to Russia, 
the oldest one, but he came  back afte r the war 
and got ma rried in Chicago. I brought him here, and he
 got killed in a car a
ccident. Yal. He left a 
wife and three children. 

 

Q: What about your school
 then. Tell me about 
the school you went to. 
 

A: Well, we...we had a separate school for Je
wish kids, you know, was separate. They let 
them... 

 

Q: Excuse me . This ma kes noise. 

 

A: We finished school and I belonged to a Zi
onist moveme nt. When I was 12 years old, we  
started. And we used to go to semi nars with other 
kids from other cities. It was well organized in 
the future what you saw it was working like you 
know through the city. It was a poor life in 
Poland, but we were happy. We  didn't know any ot
her way how to live, so that was it,ﬂ you 
know. Then when the war broke out in 1939, when the Germans came in the first thing what they 

did, they collected all the real Orthodox Jews and 
put into the synagogue and 
they had to take out 
all the, you know, and everything the...and everyt
hing and put on the sidewalk and burn themﬂ. 
Only Jewish people have to do this. Then they st
arted to grab people to work every single day. 
Every Jew who walked by a building where there was a German officer, he had to kneel down 

and take off their hats when they passed by;
 otherwise, they would be shot, you know. Then

when they came  out to talk to the people, th
ey said, "Good morning, brother ﬂ ." He says, "Good 
morning, swine." You know what swine is?  Pigs. 
Okay. Then they started to grab people to 
work. All the time. Then they start to confiscat
e all the business what 
the people had. So there 
was a lot of ﬂHolsterges living in our city, so 
they knew exactly the addresses and the name s of 
the people who had business. So they went in 
and they confiscate everything. Then while we 
were sleeping, started to rip off the roofs fr
om the  building,...the roofs because they thought 
they'r e going to ma ke a garden in the mi ddle of th
e city so the Jewish people shouldn't live there. 
So everybody start to run to different places. 
They lived like 10...10 people in one small room. 

Then I got sick from typhus. Jewi
sh people was not allowed to us
e a doctor or a drugstore or a 
hospital. So they...me and ma y woma ns...in the outskirts of the city 
in a little room.ﬂ  a nd they 
sent in a doctor, a Jewish docto
r. I think he came from Ger ma ny. 
He had one artificial leg. There 
was no me dication and everybody was dying every da
y and I expect to di
e too, but it was a 
mi racle. After 8 weeks laying there, I kind of
 recovered. There was no me dication or nothing. 
They cut off the hair and everything. Then they st
arted to take hostages...p
eople. They want so 
much mone y. Ten and a half figures, two and a ha
lf figures. People gave away everything. They 

got the rings, their watches, even
 the gold you put in your mo uth, ju
st ﬂto take all those people. 
Then– 

 

Q: Whathappened? 

 

A: No. They released them. They released them
. The n they organized like a Judenrat. They 
have a release from all the people, start to make a 
gold star. We have to wear one on the left side 
and one on the right side, so when you walk on the 
street you know that you're a Jew. I went out 
from that thing when I recovered.ﬂ There wa
s no food. Nothing to eat. People just starving, 
fa milies. I lived in an attic. It was terrible 
condition, so we start to ask the Russian...German, 
"Why don't  you kill us? " They says, "No, we need those guns on the front. You'll die anyway." 
So after a couple of mont hs, they decided they
'r e not going to ma ke a ghetto. The city's too 
pretty. They going to ma ke fine building. ﬂIt's so
 close ﬂthrough Germany. They'r e going to take 
half of them from Mlawa and ha
lf of them to ﬂNewstadt, th
e ghetto. We  have to go out the 
mi ddle of the night, all of us to...to go to a little 
bridge where the water was to go into that castle. 
You know babies was crying. Some body picked up a 
baby, but it's shot right away. Then inside 
we had to go out to another...nother door. On bot
h sides were standing the German, the black 
uniform and ﬂthrowing down the rifles and b
eat over the head. Everybody went down. The blood 
was running like water. Finally, 
we had to run the truck. They 
took the doctor, threw him down 
on the ground, and the Gestapo st eppe d on his face
 with the feet and hand. He committed suicide 
in Auschwitz. ﬂ . But then they took us to News
tadt. We  ca me into Newstadt. There wa s a ghetto 
already. In the...and we watched 20 mi nutes, they
 had to beat up a Jew. There was no place 
where to go in. People wa s running li
ke crazy. They cut off the hair from the woma n. I ran into a 
stable. That where we lived there for a couple 
of weeks and we organized...we ma de a kitchen 
with a little bit soup to gi ve the pe
ople. And whole families die over ni ght.
  
 
 
Q: Tell us...tell us...slow down just a little. 
Tell us what it was like in the stable. 

 

A: That unreal. First of all, no water, 
no food or nothing. People was dying and we was 
jealous they'r e already dead. Fina
lly, I found out that they hanged 
my uncles in the other city. I 
found out. I didn't want to tell my aunt. So sh
e saw me , she said what are you crying. I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166

"No." "Did you hear some thing? " I 
said, "No. I didn't hear." I didn'
t want to tell her. She didn't 
know til the last mi nute. Then they decided they
'r e going to take us to Ausc hwitz. We  didn't 
know where we'r e going. They took us in those cattle
 trains, locked in, fo
r 3 days and 3 nights. 
Wome n are giving the babies urine 
to drink. It was bad. Half of them die anyway. And they took 
us ride for 3 days like that. We  ca me  out and 
everything got to be fast...fast. We  ca me  into 
Auschwitz. We didn't know what's going. It was in 
the mi ddle of the night. THey always did it in 
the mi ddle of the night. They...right away, th
ey cut off like let's say a 100 wome n, me n, 200, a 
100 me n. You could be young. You didn't have a ch ance. They just cut off a group. That ma ny 
they let into the camp. Right away, we don't s
ee our people...anything...our parents. In a second, 

you didn't see it. They divided. Right. Left. Right
. Left. Dr. Mengele. Once they had a little 
group for the camps, the rest went to the crem
atorium. Let's s a y there was like 3,000 people in 
that train. They took out 200 or 300 for the camp. 
Then we realized...they 
took us into a room 
and they told...we had to take off the clothes,everything. Cut our hair all over, and then they 

gave us those clothes. They didn't even fit. Ga
ve us those clothes, and they took us into a 

barrack. The barrack was...had to hold thousand pe
ople, not less. So there was their ﬂcouriers. 
How do you call it...where we in 
three lines. Nothing there, noﬂ 
blankets or nothing. Some  of 
them slept on the...on the bricks. Then about 4:00 in the morning, we had to get up and stand 

naked even in the winter to see if we have a cl
ear skin. There they count us in 5, a hundred in a 
group, and the SS with the dogs took us to work. 
We had to walk, let's say, ma ybe 10 miles a day 
to work. Many of them died on the wa y walking so
 they give us a stick 
to put us there dead 
people. Two have to hold them this way. One have
 to hold their feet to 
take them to the place 
where we supposed to work. Then we have to br ing them back because the appell. They have to 

count the people that everybody's there. So we have
 to bring those dead people back, so they put 
them like on a piece of wood two hold here and the 
rest of them hold here, to bring those dead 
people because everybody gotta be counted. Then
 when we looked around we saw people are 
standing in the line to get into 
the crematorium. No food. No bathrooms. No nothing. They want 
to get all already we be deadﬂ.  The cremator
iums was going for 24 hours. Day and night. Before 

you saw ﬂﬂThey bring transports from all over 
Europe, from France, from Belgium, from 

Holland, from Poland, from every country in Europe. They didn't mi ss one country. I think 

ma ybe Norwegian they mi ssed. The conditions in 
the camp was horrible. We  didn't see...for 7, 8 
months there was no water in Auschwitz, comple
tely. They just...just put
 electric wires around 
for barracks. There was nothing else
 there. No water. After 7, 8 
months, there's no water there. 
We have to walk to work every day. Hungry. 
The lice on the whole body, a
ll over our faces. ﬂ It 
was snowing. Beaten up. One time an SS ma n be at
 me  up with the rifle. He thought I'm dead 
already. I starts to work. Beat us up. ﬂ You know 
just for fun. Pulled out a few people, beat us 
up. Then they gave us a piece of bread, but we
 didn't know, should we take a crumb every hour 

or should we  swallow it right aw
ay. We couldn't figure out what to do with this. When we ate it 
up, we was sorry why we ate it up already. This
 way we have another crumb to eat. We was 
going to work...was beaten up, after 
work all the time, kicked us up, beat us up. ﬂ  That what we 
have to do. Slapped us. Iron wagons with the br
icks. You know, it wasn't  actually work, but on 
top of it just to ma ke people work. Just to 
ma ke people work. Then on Sunday, when we came  

back from work Sunday, the day off, we had to put
 our clothes, button up in the back and put in a 
lot of sand so one place we ﬂslept to another on
e. So people who couldn't run fast, the dogs went 
after them. Always beaten up, you know. It was 
a helluva condition. I can't believe...I was 18 
years old that that. I...I can't 
visualize how people can even go 
through that without food, without 
water, with everything. That was going on for 2 
and a half years in...in the camp. Then when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166  
4 
 
they saw the Russian...the Russian are comi ng, th
ey took us from Birkenau to Auschwitz. There 
was already better buildings and a 
better thing. In Birken
au, I forgot to me ntion, that...there was 
an uprising in Birkenau. They killed a lot of 
Germans. They put them in the oven, but in 5 
mi nutes the whole sky was with so many German
 airplanes that you c
ouldn't  see the skies 
anymore. And everybody who was moving was killed
 anyway. People start to run. They wants to 
find out how those people was organized because 
nobody can have a pencil or a pi ece of paper. 
One of mi ne  counselor, like a bloc kaltester, was 
5 girls, 5 sisters from Czechoslovaki a. She kind 
of tried to put on paper what's happened and she hid 
it in her coat and they find it. So they said 
they'r e going to shot her. So the other four si
sters stood by and they sai
d, "We want to be shot 
too." So they shot all five sisters. Then when th
ey start to figure out how the uprising...there was 
a girl...I think was her name . I fo
rgot. ﬂ  I think. ﬂ And she was organized this thing. So they 
wants to take her to hang her, so she cut her veins. And she slapped the SS ma n. He s a ys, 
"You're dying." She says, "I die today, but you 
gonna die tomorrow." Even make a film from 
that. Then one girl dropped...girls who brought in
 the evening ammunition what they smuggled 
outﬂ ammunition. One girl broke down. They beat 
her up and she says, "If you tell us, what's  
happening, you're gonna be ﬂsleep. We 'r e not going to
 torture you." But that wasn't  the...the fact. 

She knew three other girls. That's all she knew. 
And one of the girls was ﬂ  my girlfriend. They 
beat her up. She didn't tell anyt hing 
because they would hang a lot of
 people if she would tell to 
who she gave and how the things happened. The gi
rl who gave up was the first to be hanged. The 
German punished her. And everybody have to stay 
and watch when they hang those four girls. It 

was like in...in January. In January 18, we 
have to leave the camp. They announced the 
mi crophone, we...I and five girls wants to hide 
it between the floor. So they announced on the 
mi crophone if they catch anybody, they will be shot 
on the spot. So I says to the gi rls, "Maybe 
it's no use to do it. It looks like the world's comi ng to an end to the German army. Let's go." So 

we starts to walk. We  couldn't 
walk. We have to run out from 
the camp. And in five in groups. 
And who couldn't run was shot. Right away on the spot. Some  people begged, "I want to just 
catch my breath." No. If you couldn't run, you 
know, people haven't good shoes and all these 
things, so they shot. And we was jealous. They
 are already dead, and they don't have to go 
through all this. Finally, they took us on a truckﬂ
 to get deeper to Germany. We  was without 
covers and the snow was comi ng on us. No boots.
 And then about thousand woma n was walking. 
They threw one bread. You know how ma ny pe ople got 
killed just to...I neve
r runned for that. I 
knew. The first one got crushed already. One br
ead for thousand people. ﬂSuch a sadistic way. 
Then they took us into Ra vensbruck. In Rave
nsbruck, the hunger was unb
elievable, terribl e. 
Already, they gonna take us to Gross Rosen, and th
ey didn't let us in. They
 got a little too ma ny 
people, so they took us to Ravensbruck. In Ra
vensbruck, we was there 
a couple weeks and saw 
the Russians were behind, comi ng, they took to 
fr om Mettlenberg, Newstadt ﬂ  in the camp. A 
room like that was a few hundred wome n. I f 
you lay down to sleep, you couldn't turn around. 

There was no room. Tha t 's  how you had to lay al
l night. This was the...w
e was there in that 
camp. It was terrible. The hunger...they gave us 
a little piece of bread for 24 hours. It was 
unbelievable how people was dying. The end was near
 that camp was people...pilots...which they 

was shot down American planes, and Canadians so the Germans locked the gate and they ran 

away. It was in... 

 

Q: I don't understand. Explain. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166

A: When the war come  to a...to a finished, th
e German run away from that camp, from us, 
and they locked the gate. And we didn't know th
at the war was to end. So those people, those 
pilots cut the wires...you know was 
divided, and told us that the 
war is over. The Germans went 
away. So we starts to run to the...out to get 
some  food, you know. All the Germans from this city 
left the houses. They knew that we come  out th
ey're gonna be killed. They knew that what was 
going down. So everybody left those houses...that we
 went into those houses, and we took food. 
We got food for here, but we were... But I even 
now we was tired walking, so the same  day came 
in the...the American soldiers and the Russian
s the same  day, to Mettlenberg. And they was 
kissing each other. Thank God that the war is over, because in some  places the Germans was still 
fighting. So there was a guy...a Germ
an guy with a wagon with horses. So we told him to give us 
the wagon, the horses. He  says, "No." So a Russian officer walked by, took him by the head, 

threw him in the..in the...in the yard. He sai
d, "You give them everything they wanted." The 
Russians said that like this. They
 were very nice to us. Real nice. So we took the horses and the 
wagon and we start to go out closer to the cit
y. Then when the night came  over, we took out a 
house, and we went the house to stay overnight. Pa
rt of the way was a lot of soldiers. You know, 
they let out fr om Russia, from the jail everything, 
and there was a rape of a lot of girls. So one 
Russian officer came in, a very intelligent ma n, a
nd he says, "Listen, the war is over. There's a 
lot of people came out fr om the jail. They do bad things. We  can't  control it. But I'm going to sit 

here a whole night and wa tch you."
 We were 10 girls togethers, 
which was nice. He was sitting. 
While he was sitting, they knocked on the door. Th
ey saw comi ng in. So he went to the door. 
They ran away. They was afraid for him. So he 
s a ys, "I can't protect you anymore," he says. You 
take...try to take the trains and go to Berlin be
cause in the city will be more protected. So we 
went on a train. The trains happened like ther
e wa s going for an hour and 6 hours there was 
standing. It was broken off. We went
 in the train. We  was together
 10 girls. And Russian soldiers 
came in and they took I imagine they saw girls. 
They says, "We 're going to bring our friends 
here." While he was in the other side, we ranout from the train. The train was standing. And 
there was a lot of broken trains. So we decide
d every girl would go, lay down under a train. In 
the morning, we will board it. We  were layi ng li
ke  that a whole under those broken trains. You 
know, every girl. In...In the morning, we got up. 
The train left alrea
dy with our stuff and 
everything. We didn't care already. So
 we starts to go from one city
 to the other ti
l we got into 
Berlin. We ll, being in Berlin, we di dn't  have 
any families. We  didn't have anybody. They wasn't  
well organized like after the war, so we deci
ded we'r e going back to Poland. Because we got 
some  property there, we'r e going back to Pola
nd. So 10 girls came  back to Poland. We  didn't 
realize that Poland was worse than with ﬂthe Ge
rmans. They didn't want any Jew to come there 
because then they claim their pr
operties. So they didn't want us. So when you went out on the 

street, you saw laying dead Jews, which they cam
e back from Russia or from the army . They 

weren't mi ssed by nobody. They didn't  have any family, so nobody knew who they are. Their 

fa milies was killed, and they sneaked out from Russia in 1945. So all the time you saw. So 

finally, what we gonna do?  I came back to my city. 
With five other girls, went in a house. The 
ﬂArmy Kiova went in and they killed those girl
s. One was under the bed. They didn't know that 
she's alive. She's 9 years old. ﬂ . Anyway, they sa
w a Jew, they killed it. They wasn't  mi ssed by 
nobody. So we decided it's  not good we...in the city e
ither. So we went to Lodz. I went. A few...a  
few re ma ined. They got boyfriends right away. I 
went to Lodz. I came to Lodz. I went into a 
kibbutz. We  got a roof over there. There's some t hing 
to eat. Israel wasn't  established in that time. 
I was in Lodz. So one group went to a different  city for a...a reunion. They took off 4 boys...I 

shouldn't have bring their picture,
 I think I got. They took off four boys and a girl and they killed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166  
6 
 
them right away, from t he train. It was 18 or 19 y
ear olds. So you could only 
be in that kibbutz 6 
months. We  have to smuggle our way to Lodz. I fi
nd out that my brother is alive in Russia. I 
want to wait for him. So I went to Bialystok. 
ﬂ We went into a kibbutz. He  was there. Another 
kapo ma n. Meantime , my brother ca
me. The police came in one night
 and this...told us there're 
going to pogram. They'r e going to kill us. So ever
y 2 hours, 2 other me n were standing. In time, 
5 people went back to Lodz, those 
of us who wa nt toﬂ want to go. 
 
Q: I don't understand. 

 

A: Five people went to ﬂValsa from that ki
bbutz. Yal. ﬂ . In time , one boy saw what's  going 

to come . He was hiding by another lady, she had a 
ﬂ . So they didn't see that boy. All the other 12 
was killed. So he told us in Bialystokﬂ that
 they was killed. He came into ﬂValsa. It's 
unbelievable. People don't  realize how ma ny Jews we
re killed after the war from the Polish end. 
The reason I was still in Poland...I didn't go to Isr
aelﬂ, I was waiting for my
 brother. I know I had 
only one...one brother. He was alive. So I was wa
iting in Bialystokﬂ. Then the Brichah saw that 
too ma ny Jews get killed in Poland, and we had 
to go out. But they came  in...People start the 
killing for Russia because about half a million Jews escaped to Russia when the war started. But 

they start to come back. Some of
 them got killed in ﬂ . Some  of 
them died. Some of them came 
back....the children. They came back to the Brichah, took us to Czechoslovakia. You have to 

work to the Polish. You took a train to Czechoslo
vakia. And over there, their parents was waiting 
for us. ﬂ You couldn't stay too long in Czechoslova
kia. We had to go to Austria. We came to 
Austria in the barracks. I didn't have nothing to eat.
 We  had to run in...in to
 the fields and catch a 

carrot or potato to eat, because
 they wasn't  prepared for that. So in time, my husband had a 
couple of brothers in Russia.  

 

Q: Hold it. Slow down a little bit. Where did you met your husband? 
 
A: Yes. We ll, I was standing like this...he...my 
husband was liberated in Austria. He didn't  
want to leave there. They gave him a hotel 
and they put a few people for those they were 
housing. The day he ﬂ  boat is comi ng and some  brot
hers in Russia, so he came to see if he'll find 
some body. There's only people from Russia . They stood 
in Germany or in Austria. I said, "Well, 
the reason I went back to Poland, 
I knew I wanted to 
see if somebody is alive from Russia." My 
brother. So I stood there a y
ear in Poland. You couldn't leav
e Poland. The...the Russian was 
there. You couldn't leave Poland, when the Russian was there. You couldn't leave Poland.ﬂ ﬂ  

But the Brichah some how got those people out 
from Poland to Czechoslovakia. And I me t my 

husband and he told me  that he had papers to 
go to the United States. A 
second cousin signed the 
papers. If I ma rry, I can be on those papers. So
 I says, "I have no c
hoice. Either I wasn't  
established. I was sick and tired 
from...from all this life. I couldn't take it anymore. So I says, 

"Okay." But only if my brother go
es with me, but it took the governme
nt in Austria to let him in 
because you not supposed leave the city.ﬂ, only 
the ﬂ . So I got marrie
d. Right?  After a week, I 
got married. We stood in Austria and we was waiti
ng to immi grating to America. Here. But my 
brother couldn't. Only me because I was on the 
paper. When I came to America, it wasn't  like 
now. They have...because we had a sponsor. That sponsor had to be a very cruel ma n. He got the 

papers for some body else. So when we came here
, we couldn't  have any help from nobody. On 
the third day, I went to work down town. You 
know, I got work right away, and my husband 
couldn't get a job. I got a job. I start to work. I work
 overtime. I worked all the time , just to ma ke 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166

a little mone y. I said, "I don't want to be poor. I 
can't  be without shoes, without clothes." And I 
start to work.... 
 

Q: Where did you work at? 

 

A: I...work in a...not factory.
..ma king suits, ladies suits 
and clothes, you know. So I was 
there, ki nd of fast piece work. I worked all th
e time. Then my husband couldn't get a job, so 
some body t old us to open up a 
little cleaning store in a 
Polish©Jewish neighborhood. My 
husband didn't  speak English. I speak a little bit. 
So we opened up that store. After work, I came 
in and worked in the clothing store til 12 o'cloc
k at night to make a few dollars to get an 
apartment, you know. So after 2 year
s like that, then I have my ch
ildren. And I had an apartment 
and I had a little money in the bank. I had the tw
o children. My daughters ar
e very well educated. 
They all finished college. And I had...my oldest
 will have a Masters from Harvard College. They 
took piano lessons 10 years, went
 to Hebrew school. All those 
things. My younger daughter is a 
lab technician. She got a good prof
ession. She got ma rried. Now she is
 India. (crying) If not, for 
her I wouldn't  be alive. Only for her, I'm liv
ing. Not for me . (crying) You know, I can't sleep 
because all the pictur es what we went th
rough doesn't go away. When I sleep with my 
daughter...you see I live along my husband died
 14 years old. When I live along, I don't know 

how I sleep. When I sleep with my daughter,all comi ng back to ﬂ . Cause I'm screaming, 

some ti me s running, screaming and standing by th
e crematorium. That don't go away.ﬂ I'm 
always screaming because it's very real and I 
dr eam about it. ﬂ  and I don't know what's  going on 
you know. But the only thing, if I would...if I wouldn't have my daughter because she's so good 

to me, it's unbelievable, I wouldn't be alive. I wo
uld finish my life because you have no relatives. 
On holidays or some thing, nobody's there. And I thought 
if I sleep three hours 
a night that's a lot. 
I can't  fall asleep. Never. All the things comes b
ack. I's real like I'm in Aus chwitz. ﬂ  No matter 
how much you try, you just can't  go away all th
ose things. ﬂ What else do you want to know? 
 

Q: Let's hold it and stop the tape. What's  going on? 

 

Q: Turn the tape back on. Te ll me  when we rolling again. You okay? 

 

A: Yal. I'm alright now. So if it's not for my 
brother, I would finish my life. Even though my 
other daughter is well educated, she is not as cl
ose to me  as that one, you knowﬂ. Yal. She's very 

good. She calls me  every day. In the morning when she gets up, before she goes to sleep. They 

go trips. They always take me  with, you know, so
 she's really my...my life . Without her, I 
wouldn't survive. You know, the older you get, the 
weaker you get to take
 all those things you 
know. The...it...it's harder to take, you know, when
 you think about all those things. It doesn't  go 
away. Never goes away. The picture. All those pi
ctures. When you laying in a stable, you haven't 
got work to eat, and you jealous 
the others die and I didn't. A
ll those things doesn't  go away. 
Never. I can see some  people twill 
their little foot or some thing. Th
at is unreal to me . And people 
was starving like that, but what the Ge rmans 
did, Iﬂ don't think nobody can even put in words. 
All those things what happened. It's impossible to describe those things. Just impossible. 

 

Q: Sonia. I would like to take you back again. Okay? 

 

A: Yal.

Q: If we can. You told me ...go back, all the way back to the ghetto.  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: You told me  that your uncle was hanged. 

 

A: Yal. 

 

Q: There were several people hanged. 

 

A: Yal. Seven people together 

 

Q: 
c
Alright. Can you go back and tell us 
very slowly the story of that. 
 

A: Yal. We ll, when they took us out from the 
city to the ghetto, there still was Jewish people 
in the ﬂChanno. They need them for work somy uncle decided he'll go back with...with the 

daughter, you now. He was hiding in
 a attic, and for some  reason the German find out about it. 

Some  of them went a running back. They shot
 them right on the spot, you know, when they 
catched them on the way. ﬂ . They took my uncle
, and they took the me n whose house was there, 
and my cous in, a couple from another city, a boy,
 ﬂLindenberg from my c ity. And because my 
uncle have a brother, the brothe
r have to be hanged too. Usually when they hanged people, they 
sold tickets that the Germans going to be show. When they hanged my city, I wasn't  there when 

they hanged the five people. Two they hanged be
cause they was hiding there. They throw around 
the things on the cemetery to find out. So they
 hanged two people. Then the hanged five other 
people, and the family...and they warned them if they
 cried, they'd be shot so they have to stay 
and watch it for 3 hours, from 6 to 9. Mine uncles, because they were prominent people, they 

paid off the Gestapo, they should ma ke execution 
another city, so the fami ly shouldn't stay and 
watch that. So they took it to ﬂMettlenberg, a di
fferent city and that happened in ﬂ , and they 
hanged those seven people. Mine cousin was fighting 
back and they shot her. She didn't  want to 
walk up to the hanging. There was seven people. 
When I find out, I was in the ghetto. Mine...my 
aunt didn't know about it. I didn't want to tell 
her I find out. Then when I was in Auschwitz, I 
thought to myself if I ever survive, that's th
e only thing what I'm goi
ng to do is look for my 
brother who went to Russia and di
g out those people. So I picked myself up and I went to this 
city, but a couple of Jews are ther
e already. I walked into them and 
I told them to help me how to 
go through with that. I know
 it's not a easy thing. 
 

Q: After the war? 

 

A: After the war. Yal. They helped me . They 
helped me . They have to have a permit. They 

put them in one casket, all thes
e things, and we got them on the Jewish ceme tery. Then, a day 
later, I walked out to ma ke a ma rch on this lit
tle thing. I was arrested by the Polish people. So 
what are you doing on the cemetery. I said, "Well, 
I have to put a ﬂ  because I'm going to leave 
this country." He says, "You ar
e a spy." I said, "How a m I s py when I have number on my hand. 
I was in Auschwitz for 2 and a half years." He 
said, "Everybody could ma ke a number." So they 
arrested me . "You're on the cemetery. You're a s
py." So finally, they let me out, you know. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166  
9 
 
finally let me out. I was glad to 
leave that country. It's hard to
 believe it, what the Polish people 
did to the Jew. It's  just unbelieva
ble. If a person went in, he didn'
t go out alive. When I was in the 
ghetto, it was...uh...a Jewish ma n. He was a ﬂ . You know what a ﬂ  means. So he divided 
between son...the son was by one family, and he wa
s by another family.ﬂ He had to have in the 
morning girls. And he paid off those Polish 
people. After the war, the guy come  up...he's 9 
years...their older son. I saw hi
m when I was in Europe. He cam
e out. He went into the other 
fa mily to look for the father, but the father wasn
't  there. So he took a few Russian people and 
started to dig up in the baseme nt and he was burie
d. They took the money, but they killed him on 

top of it. So the son ﬂ  by a different family. 
He was by a different family. It's unbelievable, you 

know. It's unbelievable. The Jewish people came b
ack. They have a house. They figured they'd 
go and take the papers and get back. They walked
 in the house. They didn't  come  out alive. I 
have a close girlfriend now. She was in there 
from Wa rsaw, and she wa
s hiding in the woods. 
She was lost in there. After the war, she came back to the girlfr iend what she went to school 

together , and she says, "Could I sleep over by you til I get organized and we go further." She 

says, "Yes, you can sleep by me ." While she was 
in bed, she hear the brother came in and he 
said, "What?  Youﬂ took in a Jew?  I'll kill her.
 I'll cut off her head." So she ran out through the 
window. Luckily, she wasn't  sleeping. She heard 
that. So she ran out from the window. What?  
You gonna save ﬂa Jew?  After the war, mi nd you. 
That's  how it was in Poland. It was a very 
danger life in Poland. I was there almost a year 
waiting for my brother came  back fr om Russia. 
Otherwise I wouldn't probably stay that long ove
r there. But it's unbelievable what's happened, 
you know. People come  back. When we came into 
Czechoslovakia, the Brichah took us out. The 
Russians...the y pick them up like a piece of bread, 
a little milk to ge t from the kitchen to 
everybody. They are different from people to pe
ople. The Czechoslova ki an didn't know people 
are comi ng. They all run up and give away the last
 piece of bread.ﬂ In Poland, ﬂ . That's  the way 
the situation was in Poland. It's  unbelievable. I wa
s glad to leave Europe. When I went back to 

Israel, they asked me , Don't you wa nt ﬂ  "Don't you 
want to go to Poland to the ﬂ ?" I says, "I 
don't want to look at their faces anymore. I don't 
want to have  nothing to do with these people." 
That's the memories of these people. 

 

Q: I'd like you to go back to
 Auschwitz again if you can. 
 

A: Yal. Yal.  

 

Q: You talked about the... 

 

A: Theselection. 

 

Q: Thehanging. 

 

A: Yal. 

 

Q: I'd like to know more about it. Can you... 

 

A: Yal 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166  
10 
 
Q: Tell us what happened when...why did the gi
rls try to smuggle out gun powder and what 
happened and what was the reaction? 
 

A: Yal. We ll. Well, people decided that we'r e 
never going to go out alive from there. There 

was no question about it. The told us every day, 
"If the world finished 12 o'clock, 10 before 12, 
you be killed." That's what they
 tell us. But when the Russians 
start to come  to Poland and the 
Germans start to lose the war, th
ey start to take apart the crem
atoriums. They didn't want a see 
anything left. One was left. The...all the other five
 was done with it, so the people have to take 
apart. So we smelled in the air 
that the war eventually
 will come  to an end, but we not going to 
go out alive, because that's what they told us. So the people decided they going to ma ke uprising 

there. The only way...they didn't having nothing, so
 a lot of girls works in a union. They called 
the union where they maked ammu nition. So the girl
s smuggled out ﬂafter 
work and they gave it 
to the me n to through the wires you know. A lot of 
me n ca me into Birkenau camps, so they put a 

contract. They came into work in the camp. So 
they gave them this ammunition. Took ma ybe a 
year to or ganize that. And they decided that one day they gonna cut the wires, run and kill 

the...few SS what they were there. Well, it 
wasn't  the case like that because the Polish 
underground supposed to come  to help. They never show up. You see, they never show up, so 

the 10 kids...soon they start to ki
ll a couple of Germans, they put them in the oven and cut the 

wires, the whole sky was with airplanes, German
s. You didn't see the sky. Just airplanes. And 

they start to shot down the peopl
e start to run. Out you know. And th
en the start to investigate. 
They want to know how the whole thing was organi
zed. And they start to 
beat up those girls who 
work and that only one girl broke down. She coul
dn't take it anymore, and she told them...she tell 
them to leave her alone. So she only knew the thr
ee other girls. In betw
een those three was my 
girlfriend. We went to school together. We ll, they 
beat them up in the office. I have a girl what 

she was a secretary there and she told them this
. Stripped them naked, and they beat them up 
with that...how do 
you call it?  Uh... 
 

Q: Awhip? 

 

A: A whip. Yes. And the whip was between was steel. They whipped them up on the body 

and a doctor was reviving them they should tell.
 Well, they never told anything anymore. And 
then decided they'r e going to hang them. And that
's  what they did. Like in January. But 2 weeks 
before, they took us up on the camps, and we 
had to run. The Germans...because the Russians 

were behind, you know. And they hanged those four
 girls and everybody had to stay and watch it 

while they hang those those 
girls. That was the end. 
 

Q: What happened to the me n who had been involved in the uprising. 

 

A: Well, a lot of them got killed. They st art to
 run out from the camps and they killed them 
on the way. Whoever starts to run, they killed them all. You know, after all, they had the 

airplanes. They had ammunition. The people ha
dn't got nothing. But there was an uprising, but 
an uprising Bialystok they told me
. Some  of the people was there. I 
went  to see that gr ave. With 
little things, they was hiding. 
People was hiding bags. The only 
thing even people say why the 
people didn't fight back. That's a very stupi
d question. When you having nothing in your hand, 

and the Gestapo stays with the...with the guns an
d with the dogs and they beat you up and you're 
hungry and you're thirsty, and you don't have a ﬂ ?  
How can you fight back?  It's  a mi racle how 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166  
11 
 
the ﬂ  for five weeks. Wi th hunger, with people, 
with sickness. Together they wanted to...to buy a 
gun from the Polish people. And they fought for 
five weeks. I'll never figure...figure out how 
they could do it when there was sickness a
nd typhus and hunger. People was dying from the 
sickness. Nobody paid attention when some body was 
dying. That's the way it was. And that's the 
way it was in the ghetto. Newstadt they put 
a big fence. People couldn't go out. People was 
dying. Without food. Without everything. It's...it'
s just a mi racle some body survived. I can't 
figure it out myself. People can some times go hungry fo
r weeks, and that's the way they survive. 
But some of them can't . Some do. Some can't
. People standing by...by every day in Auschwitz, 
you have to go up 4 o'clock in the morning, stand in
 the line, shivering cold, stripped until na ked. 
That's to look for a little thing on the skin. Whic
h we didn't have even water or anything for 7 

months. They put them right on the side. And a 
lot of them decided, it's not...it's not worth to 
live. So they just touched the electric wire and 
they were dead. Decided it's  no use to live a life 

like that. We'r e not going to go out from here a
nyway. So a lot of my friends did, and a lot of 
me n did it. Suddenly, we used...we could hear 
the screaming through th
e wires in the men's 
camp. They beat up the men, and the screaming 
was fill the sky. It was a horribl e situation. 

Nobody can...can even visualize what it was there. Unbelievable. When we  came  into the camp, 

was mud til here cause it wasn't  regulated, a si dewa
lk ﬂ or anything. People put in a foot, they 
couldn't go out. One with the other the hand just 
to get up from the mud.. Just ma naged to put on 
the electric wires, but nothing there. But mala
ria and sickness and all those things. The only 
thing is the one day a Hanukkah. That as a ho
rrible day. We  was standing in the camp. 
Hanukkah. I reme mber that day. And they need peopl
e to gas. They didn't  have any transport 
from the outside. I mean they cut off hundreds of people, thousands. I came back to my block. 

From thousa nd girls, only three came  back. The re
st was gone. They had to ma rk the list. That's  
how ma ny have to be killed. Not one person coul
d be mi ssed. If they didn't have on the outside, 
they took from the camp. And the camp was always a 
lot of people. So they just cut off 500 her e , 
200 here, that's what they got. When they took them
 on the trucks to the crematorium,  they just 
had to push one button. Like you see some ti me  a 
truck, lift that and pot
atoes fell down. That's 
how the people fell down. Every...Everything got to be
 fast, fast. Not to wait til they walked out. 
Just to push a button and the truck threw over an
d the people fell down like potatoes, one on top 
of the other. It's...it's unreal. The people doesn't
 even know. It's just like you put a drop in the 
ocean. Whatever people saying, what
ever they seen in film, it's..
it's just nothing compared to the 
reality where it was. 

 

Q: How did you...you said that you came back fr
om a thousand girls had been taken. 
 

A: Yes. Only three girls. The next da
y there was another transport comi ng in. 
 

Q: How did you escape? 

 

A: Well, we didn't escape. They just cut us o
ff. Oh, that came  out and the mi ke fell out. How 

you put it in? 

 

A: I didn't escape. They just cut– 

 

Q: Wait. Wa it. The tape isn't rolling yet. Okay. Now. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166

A: Yal. The three girls. We  was afraid they'r
e going to take us too because they took away 
everybody so they built like a ﬂ washroom  onl
y holes, you know. So me
 and those two girls 
grabbed on a shovel ﬂand we pretend to be working here, you know, because the ba rrack had to 
make room for other people comi ng in a couple of 
hours or so. So they had to ma ke room so we 
kind of...I didn't think about it. My
 girlfriend told me , "Listen, we 
stay here, they'r e gonna take 
us. You see they took everybody. Let's run over th
ere, take a shovel ﬂand a...and a broom and 
see...pretend that we work here." And in time 
they took away lot of people you know. Everything 
was so fast going ﬂdown. It's hard to believe it.
 And the people...when they took them from the 
camp to the crematoriums was worse than when they took them from the train. They didn't know 

what's  going down. Everything was fast. But when 
they took them from...from the ca mps, there 
was screaming and crying. You know, when you know
 you're going to die, then it's worse. ﬂ  
Yal. See everything was lying by the Germans. Th
ey always told us that we'r e going to work, 
they'r e going to put us in a different secti
on. Wh en they took in 
the last transport the 
Czechoslovakia Jews from Theresienstadt, they 
even opened up kindergarten for the schools, for 
the kids. Everything so to take away the mi nd th
at some thing is going to happen. They told them, 
"You're going to work. You're going to be in good
 condition. We need the people to work." In 
the last mi nute, you know, they took them to the crematorium. You saw a show. I went with my 

daughter to see it twice you know. So then they 
told them to go down to this. They say, "Why 
you lie to us?  We  want to work. Wh y did you did to
 us? "  Start to beat them up and stand naked 
and nothing...nothing then. How...how can you fight
 back?  So they pushed them in the 
crematorium with the families. That's how...all th
e time was lying. And with the lies, a lot of 
people believed it. But when we tried to tell 
them, you know, you're not going to go out from 
here alive. You see the cremator..." They says, "B
ut look at the way they 
treat us here?  They got 
special kindergarten for school. They keep the 
families together." So there is a sign maybe 
some thing good is going to come  out. Nobody be
lieved it. They want...they didn't want to 
believe it. Le t's put it that way. Nobody want to be
lieve in those things. So...everything was lying 
to the people. Lying. And...and that's it. And they 
always told us at work, don't...when they saw, 
the airplanes was flying. Probably American or 
English. He said, "Don't be so happy there was 
planes. We  finish you up before the war." Twelve
 o'clock will be the war over. You will be  10 
mi nutes before. Which they did to a lot of people.
 They put them in special trains. They gassed 
them. They...they didn't...they didn't have the 
time the last few weeks when the Russians was 
behind, you know. They didn't have ma ny...if the y ha
d a little more time,
 not one person would 
survive. They didn't have the time to kill all of 
us. That was it. It hurts me  when I see German 

now ﬂ  like that. That hurts me . Even when the 
Germans ca me into our house to take away the 
possessions, you know what he says to me , "I 
was here 20 years ago, but I came back." That 
what I believe the Germans will do now in 20 years. 

 

Q: I don't understand. 

 

A: When they came into the city, they go in
to every house. They take away the possession, 
what you got. He says to me , "I was here 20 ye
ars ago in 1919, but I came back. But this time 
we'r e going to stay here." That's  how you can't  trust these people. One time  I was wa lking in 

Auschwitz and I saw...they brought up a transp
ort with people, me n on a truck, I mean. You 
could see there was lawyers and doctors and writ
ers. They way they was dressed. Sophisticated. 
They didn't even give them a chance to go down. 
Straight  to the crematorium. The intelligent 
people didn't have a chance. If they knew some body 
is well educated, they have no chance. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166  
13 
 
finish him off. You could thos
e doctors and lawyers between them. Everybody wished they have 
pills to commit suicide, but we didn't have 
any. Everybody would do it. But beautiful  dresse d. 
Nice, you know. And you could see. They lookedaround and they figure if people are working, 

ma ybe we gonna work too, you know. They thought to
 themselves. But that wasn't  the case. 
Because I saw them driving up straight to the cr
ematorium, because My bl ock was like the third 
block from t he crematorium. In Birkenau. I was 
there 2 and a half years.
 I couldn't believe it. 
I...there was people that 
couldn't survive l day. Not l day. It's unbelievable. 
 

Q: How did you survive? 

 

A: Well, I tell you some thing. When some  pe
ople ask me  that question, I only have one 
answer. People play on the lottery. One in 10 milli
on wins. None of my family survived fr om my 

father's and my mother's  side. Only my br
other who was in Russia. Nobody. They wiped out 
fa milies in our city you know. Nobody survived. 
Nobody. Couldn't. It...it was just a...a tragedy 
that...that people...only one person survived even 
from a city would be...would be good. It wasn't  
the case. They just wiped out...the
y were sure that they won the 
war, which they did won the war 
in Europe. Then did won the war, and they fi
gured I'll take care of and everything you know. 
They took in a lot of Poles too that was welleducated. I have to admit it. Everybody who was a 

pharmacist, a doctor, or a lawyer and come  into 
our city, they took him i mme diately away to the 
camp because they figure intelligent people mi ght
 organi ze themselves. And the reason they 
know who it was because...uh...there was a lot of ﬂ  in
 our city and they knew exactly the name s 
and from everybody. So they get on the list, and that's...that's how they find out. If somebody 

wears a black...a black shirt, that means you are 
communist. They send them right away to the 
camp. Even in 1940 and 1939. That was a symb ol th
ey say. If you wore a black, that me ans you 
are a communist. All kind of things. It's horribl
e. I don't know even...even a person could survive 
those...those... It shows you. When
 I got to the doctor and I so
me ti me  and tell him...he was a 
survivor too, but he was hidde
n in Czechoslovakia. I said, "Listen, now with the me dicine. 
Would a doctor believe I was laying 
with typhus without me dicine, not 
even a little bit of ice to 
put in the head which I have the highest temper
ature...and a little bit cold water. We  was laying 
on the floor and people was dying like crazy, and if you tell them, w
ould they believed it?  I was 
beaten up in the camps with a gun and blood wa
s running. We didn't have a mi rror. We didn't 
know how we looked. If I come  home...I f I came b
ack to the block and the girls said, "Look you 
got so ma ny holes in your head. So what...w
hat...you know what the me dicine was? We urine 
and we put in the head and we cleared it up. That
 was our me dicine. It was always beaten up at 
work. Anybody. That was their pleasure, you know. 
That was their pleasure. That was their 
satisfaction to beat up anybody. And I didn't know
 that I was bleeding. I didn't know what's 
going on. I know I was beaten and I felt it, 
but I didn't know how I looked. Nobody know how 
they looked. They told me, "Listen, take a littl
e bit urine. Wash it on the blood because ﬂ . We 
was always beaten up by the Germans. Always. 
The look ﬂ  worse than animals. Nothing. We  
came back from work, you saw people laying dead. We
 had to bring in dead from the...from the 
camp...from the work. You know, like put on a stick. 
Two carry here and one carry here and we 
had to run. The dogs was after us. And we put 
them by their block, because they had to be 
counted. How ma ny die a day. Half of them di
e walking. Everybody was afraid to say they'r e 
sick you know. So they was walking. Finally, th
ey fell. Nobody could say they'r e sick. If you're 
sick or you can't  work, you have no 
right to live altogether. That
 doesn't  go away. I can't  sleep 
nights. Every night I feel like I'm in Auschw
itz. And I'm running. There's a selection there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0166

Maybe I'll stand in this, ma ybe I 'll 
stand in this line. It's  so real
 with screaming. Then when I get 
up in the morning, I say, "Oh, My God. I can't  believe it. Everything come s back. 
Doesn't...doesn't let you go, you know. All 
those things doesn't  let you go. 

 

Q: Is there anything you want to add? 

 

A: I...I never told my kids all this stuff, but
 she's very interested. She find out from the book. 
She ma de all those pictures and 
everything. I...I wouldn'
t have the guts even to do it to tell you 
the truth. I'm not...I come  to a point I just gi
