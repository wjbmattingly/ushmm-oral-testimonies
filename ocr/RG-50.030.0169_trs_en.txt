Answer:  Ah, well, uh I was uh serving as a rabbi 
in Chicago at the time of
 Pearl Harbor.  And I 
recall listening to the radi o 
on December the 7t h, 1941, and hear
ing that the Japanese had 
bombed Pearl Harbor, and I knew in
stinctively that I wanted to be
 a part of what was going to 
happen.  We  had been reading in the press uh ab
out Kristallnacht some  time be fore, not too long 
before, and we knew that uh there, there was so
me kind of persecution against the Jews under 
the, the Nazis, so I felt sure, that I wanted to enlist as a chaplain.  And enlist I did not long, after 

Pearl Harbor , and I was uh admitted to the Army 
in Chicago and ordered to report at uh Fort 

Bragg in North Carolina on uh May the 2nd, 1942.   

 

Question:  OK.  Tell me about t
hose first weeks at Fort Bragg. 
 

Answer:  Well, they were I suppose I should 
say difficult weeks for a person who had never 
known anything about the military.  My father 
ha dn't even allowed me  to be a Boy Scout 
because he was afraid I mi ght like, I mi ght like 
military things and uh get to like to wearing a 
uniform and marching. Uh my father you can see 
was uh a pacifist and i
ndeed uh he was more 
than that.  He was a me mber of the ____________, and 
that was the first Jewish school that I 
went to at the age of four, th
e _______ Schula (ph).  Uh but uh those first days and weeks at uh 
Fort Bragg were days of learni
ng.  Uh learning a totally new world.  And so, for example, the 
very first day that I arrived, I knew that I was 
supposed to report to the Co mmanding General.  I 
went to his office, knocked on the door.  I hear a 
"come in".  I walked in and not knowing that I 
should do anything differently, I walked up to his 
desk where he was seated, and uh put out my 
hand to shake hands with him.  And uh he looked at me  with a smile on his face, and uh he was a 

very kind and compassionate ma n he said chapla
in, we don't do things that way in the Army.  
Now what you will do is you go out, come  back in
 again.  As soon as you're insi de the door, you 
come  to attention and salute, and say, Chaplain Na dich reporting for duty, sir.  I uh was shame-

faced, but I walked out of the room, knocked on 
the door again, came back into the room, did 
exactly as he had told me , and from t hat point
 on, he took me  in hand.  He uh got hold of a young 
officer and told him to spend the next  day with me , to teach me about military courtesy, the 

courtesi es of the service, and how to march in a military parade, for the very next day I was to 

march in a military parade behind the commanding general as a me mber of his staff.  Well, I, 

fortunately I learned quickly and so uh it wasn't  l
ong before I was a regular me mber of the Ar my.  
 

Question:  What were the circum
stances that uh sent you overseas? 
 

Answer:  Ah.  I was at Fort Bragg for only seventy 
days, when I received orde
rs to report to Fort 
Ha milton, Brooklyn, New York, for ove
rseas shipme nt to Army Post Office, APO 887.  I quickly 
ascertained that APO 887 was London.  And I was rather
 pleased to go to that part of the world.  
I proceeded to Fort uh Ha milton in Brooklyn and 
after waiting for ten days, I was shipped by uh 
by a 

uh Dutch freighter which was a part of a convoy of 55 ships and after sailing 24 days on the high 

seas, uh the convoy reached Liverpool.  I learne
d afterwards, incidentally, that uh another 
chaplain who had far mo re experience than I, wh
o had been in the Army Reserve in peace time , 
uh was first asked to go and he t
hought better of it.  He declin
ed and I was tapped as the next 
ma n, and I was glad to go.   

 

Question:  So you landed... 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
3 
 
 
Answer:  We landed in Liverpool. 
 I reported as I had been instru
cted to do at Cheltham (ph) 
which was our service of supply headquarters, 
and after a day or two in Cheltham and going 
through the uh routine, the red tape, I was assigned to the nort
hern, the northern Ireland Bay 

Section which was located just outside the city of
 Belfast.  The reason for my being sent there, 
since I was the first Jewish chaplain ordered 
to the European theater, was because our first 
American troops were stationed in Northern 
Ireland, and an armored headquarters, a corps 

headquarters, and uh two infantry divisions, and 
I imme diately began vis
iting every camp, every 
military camp to search out Jewish soldiers and offi cers, and to arrange for services and for 

whatever, whatever other service I could 
render to the soldiers of Jewish faith. 
 

Question:  You had told me  at lunch some thing 
about the particular way in which you solved a 
burial... 

 

Answer:  Oh yes, oh yes.  As a matter of fact
 the immediate reason for the uh request by General 
Eisenhower for a, an American Army  Jewish ch
aplain to be dispatch
ed imme diately to the 
European theater, was because there was some  ki
nd of a problem that could have beco me  a uh 
cause-célèbre.  Uh a Jewish soldier ha d had been 
killed in a uh motor, 
Army motor motor vehicle 
accident  and since there was no American Army Je
wish chaplain at  the time, the uh rabbi in 

Belfast, Rabbi _______, was asked whether he wouldofficiate at the funera
l service, the burial 
service for this Jewish soldier.  And he was very
 quick to respond of cour
se he would be pleased 
to oblige, but he said that he w
ould insist that this Jewish sold
ier be buried in a Jewish cemetery 
as is provided for by Jewish law, and he even 
offered to provide a grave in the cemetery of his 

congregation in Belfast. The Ar
my authorities told him that 
according to Ar my regulations, 
every American Army soldier overseas who would ha
ve to be buried in a foreign, in foreign soil, 
would have to be buried in an American Army, 
a military cemetery because after the war would 
be over, the remains of these soldiers, at the requ
est of their families, would be returned to the 
United States, would be returned home .  The Irish 
rabbi said that he, he 
could not officiate under 
those circumstances, and since the military were 
concerne d for the feelings and the good opinion 

of the civilian population, uh theAmerican military aut
horities saw the need imme diately for a, 

an American Ar my Jewish chaplain.  Hence the request for such a chaplain and therefore I was 

dispatched.   

 

Question:  ______.  How long were you in Ireland? 

 

Answer:  Uh I was in Ireland for approxima tel
y, well say August to November, and uh I I was uh 
ordered from Ireland to England uh when uh I a
ppeared at the various
 camps one uh fine 
morning to visit the troops, and to my amaze me nt
 the camps were empty.  I did not know where 

the troops had gone, but later I learned they had b
een shipped of course secretly for the invasion 
of North Afr i ca.  Soon after that 
I was ordered to England and sin
ce I was still the only free, that 
is non-assigned to a division, Jewish chaplain, I 
was ordered to the American Military Ce me tery 
at Brookwood in Surry, not far from London, and I was uh stationed with the American 

detachme nt uh who took care of burials at their uh
 quarters in the town of Wilking (ph).  We  
actually occupied a a small inn in Wilking.  At
 the cemetery I would offic i ate at all Jewish 

funerals on Mondays and Thursdays.  The other da
ys of the week, I would get a military vehicle 

and a driver from southern base
 headquarters in Sa lisbury, and c
over one slice of England.  I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
4 
 
carved up England into various slices
 so that I would be able to vi
sit each area onc
e a month.  In 
each Army headquarters or hospital, I would fi
nd a Jewish officer or non-commissioned officer 
or private who would know how to conduct a Jewi
sh service, give him prayer books and other 
religious supplies, have him conduct the servic
es each week, but I would show up once a month 
to uh be of help, to conduct a monthly service, 
and to help with any problems that mi ght arise. 
As more Jewish chaplains arrived in the United 
Kingdom, I would assign them to take parts of 
England or, and Scotland, and thus
 my own territory would be decreased as time went on.  But I 
went as far as Glasgow and again to Belfast, a nd in all parts of England and to some  parts of 

Wales.   

 

Question:  How long did this go on? 

 

Answer:  Uh this uh continued for about a year
 while I was stationed in Surry, near London, and 
then for the second year I was stationed in L
ondon proper uh at American
 Ar my Headquarters uh 
in London uh at uh at or near
 Grosvenor (ph) Square. 
 

Question:  And what did you do from ______? 

 

Answer:  And there I was uh a ch
aplain in the office of the theater chaplain, who was a Roma n 
Catholic monsignor, ____________.  His deputy was an
 Episcopalian chaplain, Edwin Carter, 
Jr., uh known fa miliarly as Nick Carter, and I wa
s the uh the one Jewish chaplain at theater 
headquarters, and I was given the assignme nt of uh G3 © that is I 
was in charge of all religious 
supplies there and later on in France. 

 

Question:  What did it mean to be in charge of 
religious supplies?  What  are some  of the things 
you had to do? 
 
Answer:  Uh well uh I recall particularly in Fran
ce where my job was mor e  difficult, uh that I 
had to uh obtain for Catholic chaplains, ma ss k
its for example , and uh hymnals, and hymnals as 
well for Protestant chaplains. Uh I had to uh 
visit uh vineyards (ph) who had been approved by 
the local French Catholic bishop, uh that is whose wine was approved for, for use in mass, and I 

would uh taste the various wines to make sure th
at I got a good tasting wi
ne for my friends who 
were uh Catholic chaplains, and I would uh buy the uh the wi nes for Catholic ma ss, and I 

supplied 

uh Protestant and Catholic chaplain
s and Jewish chaplains with all of their needs.  Even going so 
far as to supply New Testaments in German for 
German prisoners of war.  That I got a special 
kick out of, that a rabbi should be supplying Ge
rman prisoners of war with New Testaments in 
German.  

 

Question:  OK.  How did you get from England 
to Paris?  Wh at were the circumstances? 
 

Answer:  Well, from England to Paris, uh I was uh flown over in a small plane together with a 

number of other officers, and we landed on an 
air strip in Normandy.  The  uh German troops and 
uh I told you were not that far away, and indeed
 as our plane landed on th
e air strip in Nor mandy 
uh Ger...Germa n artillery began shelling the air st ri
p.  We were asked to uh leave the pl ane as 
quickly as possible and to run for cover, and uh 
of course I followed orders very quickly.  And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
5 
 
uh in the process I lost a brand new officer's tr
ench coat that I had 
just purchased in London 
before departure for France.   
 

Question:  You took up duties in Paris.  What wa
s your role in Paris?   What was your title and 
what was your role? 

 

Answer:  Ah, in in Paris I was uh, my title was 
De puty to the Theater Ch
aplain. Not the senior 
deputy.  That was still Nick Carter.  But I was depu
ty to the senior chaplain in the theater to the 
theater chaplain, Father Terrnand (ph) for Jewish 
affairs, so that when a new Jewish chaplain 
would arrive from the States, I was to assign hi
m to his new location.  Uh I was still uh G3, 
distributing religious supplies, and 
I was a Jewish chaplain at that
 time, in the beginning the only 
Jewish chaplain uh in the area,
 and of course we moved uh af
ter the breakthrough at St. Lowe 
(ph) we moved into Paris as Paris was captured.  
In Paris I fi rst met with the the survivors in 
Paris.  Uh and uh my position th
ere was to be of imme diate help
 to the survivors because for 
most of them I was the first cont act they had 
with the Jewish community outside.  And I was a 
signal to them that uh the Ameri
can Jewish community was there, 
at least in the 
person of this 
one rabbi, this one chaplain. 

 

Question:  Ca n you describe it?  Describe your firs
t meeting with a, with 
the group of survivors? 
 

Answer:  Uh, my first me eting with the survivor
s happened in a rather in
teresting way.  I uh took 
a jeep and drove to the area where I had been to
ld Jews had been living, the area known as the 
________, the little place.  And I flew my Jewish chaplain's flag from the jeep.  Uh you ma y 

know that the uh Jewish chaplain's
 flag consisted of a dark blue background, and in the center 
there was the Jewish chaplain's insignia, cons
isting of the Ten Commandments, the two tablets 
of the Ten Commandme nts.  Above the tablets, uh
 the uh six-pointed Star of David.  It didn't 
take long before some  people came out and reco
gnized, of course, the Jewish symbol s, and 
began to talk to me .  And they noticed on the la
pels of my Ar my uh unifor m the same  insignia.  
And they began to ask me  who I was, what was I 
doing there.  It didn't take long before a crowd 
had assembled.  And some  of the m thought I should
 talk to a small comm
ittee of Jewish leaders 
that had already been created to be of help to th
e Jewish survivors of Paris.  Now where did these 
Jews come  from who had survived the German o
ccupation of Paris?   Most of them had fled 
during the German occupation, or ju
st prior to it, to the south of
 France where the Italians were 
in charge.  The south of France was under Italian o
ccupation. The Italians we
re never as rigid or 
severe in their governance of thei
r territory as were the Germans.  And so it was easier for a Jew 
to hide hims elf in the south of France, in the ar
ea under Italian orders.  And so when the war was 
over and Paris was liberated, very quickly these Je
ws came bac k out of hiding from the south of 
France.  There were a few who had indeed 
been hidden in Paris itself.  And who had 
mi raculously survived.  Now I was brought to th
is committee that was meeting uh in a house that 
they had taken over as a Jewish community headqua
rters.  And they uh spoke to me  uh and told 
me  of their problems and their needs.  And a mon
g other things they quickly gave to me uh a 
batch of uh the yellow star that the Jews of 
France had to wear, on which of course was the 
French word ______, Jew.  And uh I brought those ye
llow stars back to America.  Uh but uh 
they told me  that their immediate need was to 
open a soup kitchen or soup kitchens, uh that food 

was in short supply. They also would like to ope
n they told me a free loan society.  Uh I 
communicated with uh the uh Joint Distribu
tion Committee in New 
York, through military 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
6 
 
channels, and I was cabled from the JDC but th
rough the Jewish We lfare Board which was the 
only organization set up to deal 
with American Army Jewish chaplains.  Through the J WB I 
received $10,000 from the JDC.  That $10,000 was used by this committee of Jews in France to 
open the first soup kitchens in Paris and to star
t the first Jewish free lo
an society that would 
enable uh small Jewish shop keepers and artisans 
to start up work again.  Uh that uh didn't end 

my uh relationship with the Jews who had surviv
ed.  I me t with the committee very often, until 
the JDC opened its own headquarters on the Rue 
de ______ in Paris uh but throughout my year 
in Paris, every morning virtually, 
ther e were as many as thirty to thirty-five Jews, Parisian Jews 

or French Jews, who found themselves in Paris,
 who lined up in the hall outside of my Ar my 

office at the Hotel Majestique which was American
 Army he adquarters in Paris.  Each one of 
whom had his own story that he wanted to tell
 me, to communi...communicate with relatives, 
particular ly relatives in America, to try 
to find relatives or problems of al l kinds.  

 

Question:   You told me  about a very special serv
ice that you conducted (ah, 
yes) in Paris.  Let's 
talk about that. 

 

Answer:  Yes.  One of the most thrilling experi
ences I had in Paris duri
ng that year was to uh 
play a part in the fi rst service that was held after the liberation of Paris in what is called the 

Rothchild Synagogue on uh uh Rue de la Victoire (ph)
.  Uh it's  for mal title is really the, La 

Grande Synagogue and that synagogue was pack
ed with French Jews, ma ny of whom were 
wome n wea r ing black.  And with American Army 
soldiers, most of whom were still wearing 
battle dress, their helmets on th
eir heads, battle uniforms , thei
r guns left in the lobby of the 
synagogue. And I had the great privilege of uh pr
eaching in French and speaking afterwards in 
English and I reme mber to this day that as I would come  to the end of a sentence or the end of a 

paragraph as I was speaking, and as I paused to 
draw my breath, I could hear the gentle sobbing, 
particularly of wome n in the c
ongregation.  My Fr ench address, 
my English address, each was 
punctuated by the crying of people in the congreg
ation, and it was an experience that I shall 
never forget.  They were crying for those who w
ould never return to Paris, those who had been 
killed by the Nazis.  They were crying for all that they had lost during 
the years of the German 
occupation of France.  That was a very moving se
rvice.  Nobody who attended it will ever forget 
it.  

 

(SHORT P AUSE)  

 

Question:  So me where after, while you were still 
in Paris, I believe you were ordered to go to a 
cere...a ceremony? 

 

Answer:  Oh yes.  Uh I was ordered to appear 
as the representative of Gene ral Ei senhower at a 
ceremony for French ma rtyrs who had been killed
 by the Nazis and who had been buried in a 
ma ss grave in a French ceme tery just outside of
 Paris.  Uh General DeGaulle was to be the 
principle speaker but General Ei senhower had be
en asked to send a repr esentative and the order 
had come to the theater chaplain 
to dispatch a chaplain who could 
speak French.  So I was told to 
go.  And I went.  And there was quite a crowd th
ere and we were ready to start the ceremony 
when suddenly there was a tremendous noise of bulle
ts and artillery shells
 flying around us, past 
us in all directions, and there 
was a great deal of screaming 
of course.   Everybody there was 
certain that the Germans who at that time  were 
not too far away from Paris, that the Germans 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
7 
 
must have returned.  That they were surroundi
ng the cemetery.  That their target was Ge neral 
DeGaulle, and incidentally anybody else who was th
ere.  And therefore all of the shooting.  And 
I quickly dodged behind a tall monume nt, and a lit
tle bo...little French boy ran past me . I grabbed 
him and pulled him down beside me .  He had be
come  separated from his mother.  He was 
crying, and I held him near me  all throughout the 
uh shooting.  When it su
ddenly got quiet again, 
all of us left the cemetery quickly.  It was onl
y the next day that I l
earned through the French 
press that what had happened was that on th
e railroad tracks just outside the cemetery, the 
Germans ha d left two carloads of ammunition, she
lls, bullets of all desc
ription, and spontaneous 
combustion had started this tremendous racket of 
all the bullets and shells being fired and uh we 

were just very fortunate that uh we weren't kille
d.  I never got to give my uh carefully prepared 
talk in French.   

 

Question:  What else we re you 
doing in Paris at that time? 
 

Answer:   Oh, uh I must tell you of some thing in
 which I took great pleasure.  I, I me ntioned 
earlier that I was in charge of
 all religious supplies for the American Army on the continent of 
Europe.  And months before Passover I realized th
at we would need ma tzo (ph) for the American 
Jewish troops.  And when I went to the Quarterm
aster General he informed me  of course as ... 
 

END OF T APE  

 

...that but that uh if I could locate
 a matzoth factory in England I could order as much matzo as I 
wanted, that it would be charge
d on reverse-lend-lease, and he 
added since the British are not 
going to pay us in total (ph) anyhow, order as much ma tzo as you want.  We 'll charge it to 

reverse-lend-lease and 
the British will pay for it.  I took hi
m at his word.  I gave that English 
ma tzo factory that I had discovere
d the largest order it had ever 
received.  When the matzo came 
sailing across the Channel to Paris to me, it fille
d an entire libe rty ship, which rode high in the 
waters of the English Channel and the ma tzo wa s deliv
ered to Paris.  I dist
ributed it to all of the 
Jewish chaplains then serving with the Americ
an Ar my for further distribution to American 
Jewish troops, for the various Passover _______ that
 would be held.  Incidentally I held my 
Passover Seder for six thousand troops in the Lido 
in Paris, on the Champs d'Elysee, the largest 
nightclub in Paris, an odd place to have a seder 
but it worked out very well.  No nightclub acts 
but a seder each night for three thousand soldie
rs, three thousand the fi
rst night, three thousand 
the second night of Passover.  But 
I had a great deal of ma tzo left 
over, so I distributed it first to 
the Jews of Paris and I gave ma tzo to the Jewish
 chaplains with the free Fr ench troops, the free 
Czech soldiers, the free Polish Army , and distributed 
the rest of the matzo to
 Jewish civilians in 
France and Belgium because food, bread in pa rt...i
n particul ar, was not easy to purchase.  It 
couldn't be found in in any great measure, and 
ma tzo could be eaten not only during the eight 
days of Passover of course, but 
throughout the year.  So that wa
s my big order of ma tzo, and its 
distribution.  Further when  ______ came a
nd there was a need for__________ and for _______ 
palm branches used during the festival services of the Feast of Tabernacles, again the 

Quartermaster General obliged me  by arranging to
 have it on reverse-lend
-lease and the British 
again paid for it. And the uh _______ and ______were 
purchased in what was then Palestine, 
flown to Egypt, an..by British pl anes, flown from 
Egypt to Paris, once again by British planes, 

and I had enough to distribute to all parts of the 
American Army wherever troops were located.

(SHORT P AUSE)  
 

Question:  OK.  You wer e  in France for quite a while.   

 

Answer:  I was in France for a year.  (Um- hum)  
And I traveled incide nta
lly to uh all parts of 
northern Fr ance, Belgium, and eastern France to m
eet with the Jewish chaplains, particularly 
those serving with the uh front line 
infantry and armored force divisions. 
 

Question: What did you see as you tr
aveled in the way of survivors,
 Jewish survivors, in France? 
 

Answer:  Well, uh interestingly 
enough, in a number of French communities, small groups of 
Jews returned and the American Army Jewish ch
aplains did an extraordinary piece of work in 
helping them.  Uh I think of Chaplain, the la
te Chaplain Isaac Kline (ph) in _______ and ma ny 
Jewish chaplains in various Jewish commun...in va
rious Je wish communities in France who first 

brought the returning Jews the 
necessities of life-food, me dical
 supplies, medical treatment 
through Army me dical officers and the where-with-a
ll, the necessities for daily living and then 
helped reconstruct the co mmunities.  Uh these Jewish chaplains would write back to their home 

communities, to their home  synagogue and ask the me mbers of their synagogues to collect 

clothing and children's toys and soap and variou
s other items that would be needed by uh the 
beginnings of Jewish communities 

in different parts of France 
and Belgium.  And the communities responded generously.  
Hundreds of packages would arrive for a single 
Jewish chaplain.  And he would distribute the 
contents to the Jews in the community where he wa
s.  And Jewish chaplains went further.  They 
helped rebuild synagogues and Jewish community 
centers so that Jewish communal life began 
once again in these communities, albeit with far fewer Jews than had been there before.  This I 

witnessed as I traveled
 through various parts of especially
 of northern and eastern France and 
Belgium.   

 

Question:  Was it at this time that you fi rst me
t up with representatives of the Brichah (ph)? 
 

Answer:  Ah, I'm glad you asked that question.  Uh
 I first met with the 
representatives of the 
Brichah when I was still stationed in Paris.  
And I was approached one day by one of them who 
came to my office at the American Army Headqua
rters, the Hotel Majestique, and who told me  
uh that he wa s involved with some  other Jews
 from Palestine in help
ing to bring Jewish 
survivors to ports in southern France.  He told
 me  that other comr ades of his were working 
elsewhere to bring Jewish survivors to ports in 
southern Italy.  From these French and Italian 
ports, the plan was that these su
rvivors would board sh
ips and would be brought to the coast of 
Palestine.  Now this was prohibited by the Britis
h who were still in control of Palestine, and so 
these ships were called i
llegal ships.  This was 
called quote "illegal immi
gration" unquote, uh but 
these me n and wome n were working to save Jewish
 lives.  This particular ma n who came to my 

office in Paris told me  that a group of a few 
hundred, he me ntioned possibly as ma ny a s eight 
hundred, would be move d soon from a southern Fr en
ch port.  Could I possibly help with getting 
food supplies because even had they the money, it 
would have  been very difficult to buy food in 
France at that particular time in history.  So I sa
id I would inquire and find out what I could.  At 
the Officers' Mess that evening, I spoke to an 
officer who was working at uh the Quartermaster 
General's office.  I asked him if he could help 
me .  He said as a ma tter of fact uh there was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169

large supply that filled several 
warehouses in Paris of prisoner of
 war parcels that had been sent 
from the United States during the war that were 
to be shipped to Switzerland.  From there the 
International Red Cross would send them to Ame r
ican prisoners of war in Germany.  Now these 
parcels were full of food of high qua
lity and they, they were partic
ularly chosen kinds of food for 
the nutrition that they would provide to those wh
o would eat them.  The war had just been ended 
in Europe, and the Amer ican prisoners of war had 
been transhipped to French ports and had been 
sent back home .  Uh this food was still in the wa
rehouses in Paris, was appearing in the French 
black ma rketŠin other words 

the parcels were being stolen from the warehouses 
and uh this uh American officer said to me  if 
you go to the Quarterma ster General and ask for th
ese parcels for the prisoners of war, they 
mi ght be given to you.  I followed his advice.  I we
nt to the Quartermaster General.  I told him 
there was need to send uh to ship uh uh Jewish
 survivors from one place to another without 
me ntioning any particular locations.  He wasn't  in
terest ed in asking which locations.  I said to 

him I know that there are these pr is
on of war parcels that soon will 
rot, that are showing up in the 
French black ma rket.   Would he sign papers enab
ling me  to take control of those prisoner of war 
parcels?   He was relieved to get rid of the head
ache and he said just ma ke out the orders and I 
shall sign them, five copies.  He ma de out the orde
rs and for the next several days, trucks of the 
Brichah were moving these prisoner of war parc
els from the warehouses, the several warehouses 
in Paris, to their own channels for shipme nt u
ltima tely to southern French ports to go on so-
called illegal ships to Palestine.  By the way, 
there were a number of American Army  Jewish 
chaplains who helped the Bricha
h in similar fashion. There we
re those who obtained me dical 
supplies for these ships. There were those who ev
en obtained ammunition to be taken aboard the 
ships.  Indeed wherever there were Jewish chapla
ins stationed in France, if they were contacted 
by the me n or wome n of the Brichah, they found 
ways of helping the me mbers of the Brichah. 
 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 
 
Question:  Uh how did the Brichah get their trucks?   Do you know? 

 

Answer:  I'm not uh privy to that infor mation.  
I really can't  answer that.  I don't know whether 
they bought them. They did have certain funds. Th
ey could have bought them.  Uh trucks were 
not too hard I imagine because gasoline was still rationed.  When there's rationi ng of gasoline 

and gasoline is difficult to obtain and it's very 
expensive, people who own trucks are not so 
anxious to use them. 

 

Question:  Di d you help the Brichahin any other way at this time ?  

 

Answer:  Ah yes.  I helped the Brichah later 
on after I was ordered to Germany to American 
Ar my Headquarters in Fr ankfurt. 

 

Question:   OK.  Let's ta lk about Frankfurt, 
uh unless there's some thing else you want to add 
about France. 

 

Answer:  About France?  No, not n
ecessarily.  (OK.  What...) Oh yes, I, there is.  I mu st tell you 
that uh I ma de a number of friends among Jewish su
rvivors in Paris.  I wa s invited to preach in 
uh several synagogues during the High Holy Days 
and uh during the festivals and on different 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
10 
 
Sabbaths, and as a result of th
e preaching, I met a number of Fr
ench Jews who invited me  to 
their homes.  And thus I got to know a number of 
them, and my friendship with several of them 
has continued to this day.  They have visited Am
erica and I and my childre
n have visited them in 
France.  And similarly with fr
iends among British Jews in London. 
 
Question:  How did you get, why did you go 
from France to Frankfurt, Germany? 
 

Answer:  Well, after a year in 
Paris I received orders comma nding me  to go to American Army 
Headquarters in Frankfurt.  And to report for dut
ies as an advisor to the Co mmanding General uh 
dash, General Eisenhower, dash, uh to
 advise him on Jewish affairs. And uh I flew from Paris to 
uh, noŠI didn't fly.  I took the Amer ican military 
train which was an overn
ight train that ran 
between Paris and Frankfurt.  Paris was our 
rear headquarters. Frankfurt was our forward 
headquarters.  So I went by train overnight to Fr ankfurt.   

 

Question:  OK.  Can you give me  a little bit of
 background about uh suddenly being appointed an 
advisor? 

 

Answer:  As to why this came to be? 

 

Question:  How did this come  to be? 

 

Answer: This was, that's uh a question of inte
rest  because uh there was no such position ever 
before uh in the American Ar my or indeed in
 any other army.  An advisor to a comma nding 
general with regard to Jewish pr
oblems.  And there, it's interesting as to how it came to pass.  
The war, American war correspondents had reported during the summer  of 1945, and their 

reports were read by Americans in Ne w York, Chica go, elsewhere, in the in the daily press, that 
Jewish survivors of the concentration camps in 
Germany and Austria were being badly treated.  
And as a result President Truman appointed uh D
ean Earl G. Harrison who was Dean of the Law 
School of the University of Pennsylvania, to ma ke
 an inspection trip.  He came in July of 1945.  
His aid was Dr. Joseph J. Schwartz
 fortunately.  He was the very 
able European director of the 
Joint Dist ri bution Committee.  And when Dean Harri
son returned to the United Stat es toward the 
end of July, he ma de a report that was highly cr
itical of the American Army uh in Germany and 
of the ma nner in which they were taking care of
 Jewish survivors.  A
nd at the beginning of 
August there was a Zionist confer
ence held in London, the first such
 conference since the last 
world Zionist conference of 1939.   This was uhthe beginning of August 1945.  Uh several of us 

chaplains were lucky enough to ge
t to London to attend that Zionist
 conference and we told the 
delegates, particular ly I reme mber
 Rabbi Stephen S. We iss (ph) of what we had seen in Germany 

and uh Dr. Weiss, uh at the suggestion of one of 
the chaplains, the late Ra bbi Robert Marcus 
(ph), uh sent a dispatch through the American
 Embassy in London to General Ei senhower, 
suggesting the appointme nt of a Jewish chaplain as
 a liaison officer to co
ordinate the work being 
done to help the Jewish survivors in Germany.  
Uh General Eisenhower two 
days later replied to 
Rabbi We iss on the 9th of August that uh he di
d not agree with the suggestion, that uh there 
could be no appointme nt of a Jewish liaison 
officer because liaison officers were at hi s 
headquarters representing various nations.  Th
ere was a French liaison officer.  There was a 
Polish liaison officer. A Czech liaison officer.  
But there couldn't be a reli...a religious liaison 

officer.  We ll, uh Gen...General Eisenhower had 
already received from General Marshall, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
11 
 
Chief of Staff, several days before this a commun
ication telling him that 
the report of Dean Earl 
G. Harrison was very critical of the American 
Army in Ger many but on the 10th of August, the 
day after Eisenhower had replied to Rabbi We iss,
 he received a cablefrom Secretary of Wa r 
Stimpson telling him that the report of Dean Ha
rrison severely condemned the American Ar my, 
that some thing had to be done.  General Eisenhowe
r, the very same  day, re
plied to Secretary of 
War Stimps on that only yesterday he had turned 
down the suggestion to appoint a Jewish liaison 
officer. Now he was going to appoint a chaplai
n, an Ar my chaplain, to advise him and to 

coordinate whatever was being done
 to help Jewish survivors who had been found in the German 

concentration camps.  So that's how the positioncame  to be created.  And that's why I got the 

orders in Paris to proceed during the third w
eek of August at all full speed to Frankfurt. 
 

Question:  What did you find wh
en you arrived in Frankfurt? 
 

Answer:  Well, uh I uh I found that the Army ha d 
planned uh fully as to what to do with any 
survivors who mi ght be found in German con
centration camps.  There had been set up a 
combined displaced pe rsons executive , which was a large office staffed by a number of officers.  

There was a general who was in charge, Genera
l Nicholson.  Uh this combined DP executive 
was under the general command of uh the G5 on 
General Eisenhower's  staff, General Adcock 
(ph), and they were doing a good job in following
 the plans that had been prepared a long time 
before. Those plans said  simply that the surv
ivors found in German concentration camps should 
be quickly sent back to the lands of their orig
in.  And indeed French 
and, and Belgian and Greek 
and other nationals found in the co
ncentration camps within ninety 
days were sent back to their 
home lands.  But what the planne
rs had not thought of was numbe
r one there would be German 
Jews and Austrian Jews and 

Hungarian Jews who came from countries that
 were considered enemy countries by the 

American Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy 
nationalists to be found in the 
concentration camps.  The irony
 was that the Germans, t he 
Hungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived thes
e Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian 
citizenship, but now they were gi
ven that citizenship again because
 to do otherwise would be to 
follow the pr actice of of the Nazis.  And so 
they were enemy nationalists.  That was one 
problem.  The second problem was, and this was 
a far greater problem, the planners, the military 
planners had never contemplated the possibility
 that there would be survivors who were, who 
would be Jews who would refuse to return to the 
lands of their origin.  Polish Jews.  Ukrainian 
Jews.  Lithuanian, Estonian Jews.  Uh Hungari
an Jews.  Romanian Je
ws.  Because they knew 
that their homes, their businesses 
that they once had had 
in their lands of origin had been seized 
by their erstwhile neighbors.  They knew also
 that in ma ny cases their former non-Jewish 
neighbors had cooperated with the N
azis in turning in their Jewish 
neighbors.  Indeed in helping 
the Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to death ca
mps.  They knew that it would be dangerous 
even to return to the lands of their origin. 
 They were concerned le
ss their neighbors now in 
possession of Jewish homes and bus inesses atta
ck them, as indeed happened.  Moreover, 
psychologically these Jews, survivors of Ger man 
concentration camps, knew that the very land, 
the very soil where they had once lived was now 
a soil that absorbed th
e blood of their children 
and their parents and their spouses. That the 
very air was polluted with the smoke of the 
crematoria where Jews had been burned.  They ha
d no desire to return to the lands from which 
they had come .  Now it was the problems of these 
Jews in particular that
 had not been thought of 
in advance. Therefore the Army i
nde ed did not take care properly of
 these Jewish survivors.  It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
12 
 
wasn't  until the 22nd of August when General Eise
nhower issued an order that the Army take 
care of these survivors and th
at so-called enemy 
nationals who were Jewish and who had 
suffered under the Nazis should be ta
ken care of as victims of the N
azis, that the whole situation 
was turned around.  And a part of that turning ar
ound of the situation involved my being ordered 
to take on the duties of visiting 
these camps, seeing what the cond
itions we re, bringing back my 
reports to Ge neral Eisenhower or in his absenc
e to his Chief of Staff, General Walter Beetle 
Smith.  And to recomme nd changes in what
ever conditions had to be changed.   
 

Question:  At  this point we'r e 
going to break and change tapes. 
 

Answer:  Fine. 

 

END OF T APE  

 

Question:  OK.  Uh we 'v e begun.  You were, you have been assigned to Eisenhower and you 

have arrived.  Uh can you tell me , what was your first assignme nt?  

 

Answer:  Well, my fi rst assignment was to meet 
of course with the uh uh officers who were the 

staff of the combined displaced persons executive
.  And I spent oh the better part of a week uh 

learning what my job was to, to consist of.  
I read through a lot of uh files and I had long 
discussions uh with uh the several officers who we
re a part of the combi ned DP executive and 
then I uh compiled for myself a list of questions
 that would be a questionnaire for me  when I 
would arrive in a displaced persons camp.  
The questions would have to do with uh housing, 
food, sanitary conditions, me dical conditions, hea
lth of people and uh the like and where did 
these people want to go.  What
 did they see as the solution, 
the ultima te solution to their 
problems.  So arme d with this questionnaire, I st
arted off on my first tour.  And I went first to 
Bavaria uh then under the command of the 3
rd
 Army, whose commanding general was General 
George Patton.  And uh General Patton had appoint
ed a Major Schaffer (ph) as his di splaced 

persons officer on his staff in Munich, which wa
s the headquarters of 
the 3rd Army.  Well, I 
went to Bavaria and I headed first for Feldafi
ng (ph).  Now why Feldafing?   Because in the 
report of Dean Harrison, Feldafing had been prai
sed.  Indeed uh Dean Harrison had stated that 
Feldafing should be the model for 
other DP camps in the American zone of Ger many.  I went to 
Feldafing. I found uh over five t
housand Jews there and the Army contingent in charge was 

headed by a Lieutenant Irving Smith. Now Irving 
Smith was a very able and efficient Ar my 
officer.  He was Jewish.  He was 
sympathetic to the plight of the 
survivors.  And yet the Jews of 
the camp voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen, their complaints about 

Lieutenant  Smith.  Why?   Well, because he issu
ed orders without consulting with the committee. 
He, well that that was his job.  He was an Army offi
cer.  And he wasn't  traine
d to be in charge of 
a group of civilians in di re need.  But as I we
nt around through the camp with the committee, the 
Jewish committee, I was appalled by what I ha
d seen.  Why was I so upset?  Because Feldafing, 

which had been held up by Dean Harrison as 
the model camp, was severely over-crowded.  

There were uh a number  of, of uh 
ba rracks that were completely 
unfit for human ha bitation.  The 
barracks were in ma ny cases uh housing with poor r
oofing so that whenever it rained everything 
inside would get wet.  Ce rtainly as I thought of
 the comi ng winter, people couldn't be housed in, 
under such conditions.  In addition, there was seve
re crowding in all of the barracks where the 
Jews were living.  Reme mber, this wa s not a concentration camp.  The Je ws had been moved out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
13 
 
of the concentration camp soon af
ter the liberation, and had been 
put into this kind of housing, 
which had been constructed originally for foreign workers who had come  into Germany, who 
came into Germany from such countries uh as Poland and Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and 

Hungary.  Many of them were brought by the Ge
rmans as slave labor to work in German 

industry while the Germans themselves were in
 the German Ar my.  So
me had volunteered to 
come  because of their sy mpathy with the Germans.  We ll, now these foreign workers were also 

displaced persons.  They claime d the status of 
displaced persons.  And their housing that had 
been used for them was now being used by 
Jewish displaced pers
ons. And I thought the 
conditions in, in Feldafing were deplorable. A
nd I wondered how bad could the conditions be 
elsewhere if Feldafing had been praised by Dean
 Harrison as a model DP camp. I found out why 
Harrison pr aised Feldafing, and that was because Fe
ldafing at that time was almost unique in that 
it was an all-Jewish camp.  Now other camps wh
ere Jewish survivors we
re being housed were 
camps wher e non-Jews were also being housed. 
 Who were these non-Jews?   They we re the 
foreign workers I me ntioned a mo ment ago.  In 
ma ny cases they were sympathetic to the Jews, 
but in most cases they were anti-Jewish.  Many of
 them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi 
cause, had volunteered to come  as workers to Germany.  Moreover they had been fed well and 

housed well and clothed well, all 
through the years of the war andwhat the Jewish survivors of 
concentration camps required was not what they 
needed.  And to give the Jews in the camps 
where they were housed with the non-Jews spec
ial treatme nt, more food than the others got, 
better clothing than the others had gotten, more me
dical attention than th
e others received, would 
be unthinkable. It would, it coul
d create riots, that the Jews 
were getting special treatme nt.  
Never mi nd that the Jews needed the special at
tention.  It was the Jews who had suffe red under 
the Nazi severely in the concentration camps, not
 the foreign workers. But it was an impossible 
situation.  So what Dean Harrison had recomm
ended was that camps should be set up with 
Feldafing as a model, that is they should be 
all Jewish camps and they should have a Jewish 
committee who would work together with whoever 
was in charge of the 
camps, whether it would 
be uh a military group or an ______ company or wo
rkers from the Joint Distribution Committee 
who were by now being permitted to come  into Germany, a nd to work in the camps, and General 

Eisenhower in that famo us order of his of 
August 22nd also ordered that camps be ma de 
available for Jews alone, that non-Jews be remove
d from those camps and sent back as quickly 
as possible to the homelands from which they 
had come .  And that was a great st ep forward 
because that permitted additional special  treatment 
for Jewish survivors. And when I came  back 
to headquarters in Frankfurt, a
nd I uh ma de my fi rst recomme nda
tions, first orally to General 
Nicholson (ph), General Adcock and very quickly
 to General uh General Walter Beetle Smith,  
Eisenhower's  Chief of St aff, later to be Ambassador
 of the United States to the Soviet Union and 
Secretary of State, my first reports included a 
number of recommendations. One with regard to 

the crowding, that more and better housing be 
obtained.  Uh secondly, with regard to food, uh 
two thousand calories a day which was an improve
me nt over what the Jews in the camps had 
gotten earlier under the American Army treatme
nt, that two thousand calories a day was not 

sufficient to build up people who had been sufferi
ng from mal nutrition for ye
ars.  In addition, the 
two thousand calories did not provide
 sufficient nutrition.  The diet 
was not a balanced diet.  And 
I ma de another recommendation that was of v
ital importance to the Jews in the camps in 
Bavaria, including Feldafing.  Name l y, that they
 saw that their camps were surrounded by barbed 
wire.  Uh that irritated them to no e nd because 
in the concentration camps under the Nazis, their 
camps had also been surrounded by barbed wire.  
Moreover, under the orders of General Patton, 
a pass system existed in each camp under which no more than a certain pe rcentage of Jews in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
14 
 
camps woul d get passes enabling them to leave 
the camp for a certain number of hours.  The 
Jews in the camps looked out and saw Ger mans w
ho were, were the enemies of the Americans, 
Germans who had placed them in concentration 
camps, walking freely on the roads, on the 
highways.  They were not behind barbed wire.  
They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass 
to walk around freely. They, the Jews , who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were 
still behind barbed wire and had to ask for perm
i ssion to have a few hours of freedom outside the 
DP ca mp.  Well, uh I must say that uh Ge
neral Eisenhower acted 
quickly on all these 
recommendations.  Orders were don
e quickly to General Patton to 
correct these situat ions and I 
had a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one
 instance if not in othe
rs, the orders were not 
carried out by General Pa tton.  Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's  orders beginning with his 

August 22nd initial order correcting 
the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of 
command, the situation for Jewish survivors in Ge
rmany would have changed radically quickly.  
Unfortunately there was a wide gap be tween the 
headquarters in Frankfurt and the military units 
dealing with the Jewish displaced
 persons, and with all the interm
ediary levels through which the 
orders had to pass, including General Patton's 
headquarters in Munich.  And so, for example, 
when I went back again on my second trip to Bavari
a, the Jews complained to me that the barbed 
wire still existed.  The pass system had not been
 changed, and when I came  back to Frankfurt, I 
reported that to General Walter Beetle Smith.  
Soon afterwards I came into the anteroom to 
General Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's  headquarter
s, to his office, and I saw General Patton 
sitting in the anteroom at eight o'clock in th
e morning when the Army da y began in Germany, 
and I knew that I must be the reason for his being 
there.  I had reported th
at he had not carried 
out Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal 
of the pass system and the barbed wire.  I saw 
him sitting there with his pearl-handled pist ols, one on each si de of him, with his shiny helmet 

and boots.  He glared at me  withdistaste and I beat a quick diplom
atic retreat out of the office.  
Later General Smith told me that what had 
happened was that when he had reported to 
Eisenhower that I had said that 
Patton had not carried out the or
ders about the remova l of the 
barbed wire and the pass system, Eisenhower 
had instructed General 
Smith to call General 
Patton to have him report the following morning at
 eight o'clock.  General Patton had to ride 
overnight from Munich to Frankfurt to be there 
at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when 
General Eisenhower saw hi m, General Ei senhowe
r said to Patton afte
r remi nding him of the 
barbed wire and the pass system and his not ca
rrying out Eisenhower's  or
ders with regard to 
them, General Eisenhower asked him, George, w
hy don't you do some thing for these Jews?   And 

General Patton replied thinking th
at he was talking to his buddy, 
his close friend with whom he 
had gone to school at West Point,
 he replied uh Eisenhower, in a 
jocular way, well, why the hell 
should I.  And Eisenhower lost his temper, which 
he norma lly kept under control, and retorted, 

well, God damn it, if for  no other reason than be
cause I have ordered youto.  Now shortly after 
that General Patton was relieved
 of command of t he 3rd Army  and  was given the comma nd of 
the 15th Army, with headquarters at Bad Nauheim 
(ph).  I don't know why that happened, but the 
15th Army was only a paper Army.  It consiste
d of no troops, only of the headquarters.  The 
general story as uh told by newspaper corresponde
nts, the war correspondents and by the movie 

about General Patton, was that he had slapped a so
ldier in a military hosp
ital in Sicily, charging 
him with ma lingering.  But the question asks it
self, why should Eisenhower have waited so long 
to punish Patton for something that had happened 
a long time  before.  I'm not saying that this 
incident of the barbed wi re and pass system we
re the imme diate cause of Patton's demotion, but 

I'm guessing that it ma y have pl
ayed some  part in it.

Question:  OK.  Uh you were so involved in all 
of this, and you were going to the camps.  Did 
you have contact again with the Brichah 
during this period to help you at all? 
 
Answer: I ha d contact with Bricha
h.  I found them in various places
 in Germany and later when I 
went into the American zone of Austria a
nd I soon gradually came to be a kind of a 
communications factor in their ope
rations.  Scattered as they were
 in different areas of Germany 
and Austria, it was very difficult for them to co
mmunicate with each ot her.  It was impossible for 

them to give reports to a repres
entative of the Jewish agency in
 London.  At this particular time 
is was Mosha (ph) _________, later 
Mosha (ph) _______.  But I was situated at Ame r ican Army 
headquarters in Frankfurt, and I could communicat
e by telephone with all 
parts of Europe, so 
that I could speak to _______ in London and to vari
ous me mbers of Brichah in different parts of 
Germany or Austria, and bring reports from
 the  Brichah me n and wome n to ______ and his 
requests to the me mbers of Brichah, 
so that I played a small role 
there uh acting as a kind of uh a 
communications headquarters for Brichah.  Of c
ourse I continued on my rounds of the DP ca mps 
regularly, week  in, week out.  Not only in Bavaria 
but in all other parts of
 the American zone of 
Germany, a nd at this time too, I had the good fortune of welcoming a delegation of Jewish 

survivors from Bergen-Belsen in the British zone 
of Ger many.  Uh they came to me e t  with me  to 
find out what was happening in the American zone 
of Ger many with survivors, to tell me  what 
was happening in Bergen-Belsen under the British zone, and among the m I reme mb er was

Rosen______ and the lady __________, a physician who wa
s later to become  his wife, and 
several other leaders of the Jewi
sh committee of survivors in Be
rgen-Belsen.  Incidentally, the 
Jews of London, the leaders of the British, Br itis
h Jewry, wanted also to have an advi sor, a 
Jewish advisor, appointed to General Montgom
ery, who was the British commanding general in 
the British zone of Ger many.  They asked me  fo
r any kind of papers, military orders that mi ght 
be uh copied by them and sent to General Montgome
ry to, to see if he would not create a similar 
position in the British zone of Ger many.  Ge
neral Montgomery refused point blank.  But I 
continued visiting, meeting with Jewish chaplains, who once again were doing a rema rkable 

piece of work in helping Jewish survivors. 
 Uh Chaplain Gunther (ph) _______ had found a 
number of Hungarian Jewish 
women wandering across the country
side.  They had been brought 
to Germany as a part of a slave labor force, 
and upon liberation didn't know where to go or what 
to do.  Similarly with other American Jewish chap
lains, wherever they were.  Chaplain Robert 
Marcus (ph), Chaplain He rshell Shactor (ph), an
d particular ly Chaplain 
Abraham Klossner (ph) 
stationed in Munich who was of inestima ble valu
e in helping the Jews in Munich create the 
central organization of the Jews of Bavaria wh
ose name  was  later changed to the Jews of 
Germany.  I had sent Chaplain Klossner on a thir
ty-day order to Dachau where he was to help 
with the survivors in Dachau.  He did that.  He 
did not come  back after thirty days.  Uh the uh 
field hospital that had been stationed by the Amer
ican Army in Dachau to help save as ma ny 
lives as possible of the survivors, moved on.  
He rema ined behind.  He was attached to no no 
rican military unit, which was altogether cont rary to American military or ders. He remained on 

his own, finding shelter and food on his own with th
e Jewish survivors in 
Munich, but he was of 
extraordinary assist ance in helping the Jews, the 
displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons, in 
Munich and throughout Bavaria.  
 I cannot pay too much tribut
e to him a nd  to the other 
American Army Jewish chaplain
s...(how much)...oh incidentally, 
excuse me  for interrupting you, 
I was almost court martialed because of Klossner
 because my boss, the theater chaplain, Father 
______, learned that I had ordered 
Klossner who was one of the last Amer ican Army J e wish

chaplains to arrive in that batch of thirty w
ho arrived after the war wa
s actually over. Chaplain 
Elia Bonen (ph) who had been with uh the 
42nd Rainbow Division that 
had liberated Dachau, 
had helped as much as possible while his troops
 were still in the ar
ea of Dachau, but he 
telephoned me  to say he was moving on from Da chau
 with his troops to Salzburg in Austria, and 
that I should send some body to help
 the Jewish survivors in Dach
au.  Chaplain uh Abe Klossner 
had just arrived.  I had nowhere really to send 
him so I ordered him for t hirty days to the 
American field hospital that was remaining in D
achau.  When the theater chaplain learned of 
what I had done, that I had not at
 the end of thirty days seen to
 it that Chaplain Klossner should 
be ordered to another military unit elsewhere, threatened to have me court martialed uh but 
fortunately I talked my way out of it.   

 

Question:  How? 

 

Answer: How did I talk myself out 
of it? By fast talk and also because by this time I had been 

greatly involvedŠI was still in Paris at the time 
© I had been greatly involved in service to the 
Jewish survivors in Paris, to Jewish lay leaders in
 Paris, and he mi ght have been just a little bit 
afraid to cour t martial a chaplain on hi s staff w
ho had contacts, he knew, not only with civilians 
in Paris but with the Jewish community back in 
New York, with the heads of the Jewish We lfare 
Board and the Joint Distribution Committee.  Ther
e mi ght have been a row created had he done 
it, so he thought the 
better of it.    
 

Question:  Ca n you (cough), sorry, can you talk a li
ttle bit about, you've had 
these relations with 
Brichah.  You're working with the Ar my.  To what
 extent did the Army turn a blind eye to what 

you and the Brichah were doing about ma ki
ng sure that supplies got through, etc.? 
 

Answer:  Ah that's  very interesting.  I told you 
already about the Quartermaster General in Paris 
who did not ask questions he mi ght have asked 
as to how ma ny displaced persons were moving, 
where were they moving from, wher e were they
 moving to he didn't ask the questions.  In 
addition, when Jewish chaplains obtained me di
cal supplies and sanitation supplies and even 

ammunition for the Bricha h, it was with the cooper ation usually of their military superiors.  

When uh I me t General Hume  in Austria, and on 
behalf of the Brichah I asked him where would 
be a good place for survivors to cross the border.  He
 said this is altogether unofficial and if you 
are ever asked, you never heard it from me , but he
 took me  to the wall ma p and he showed me  a 
point where it would be a good place to
 cross the border.  Incidentall
y, he gave me  an article that 
was printed as a brochure that he had written 
some years before, of Moses as the first great 
military commander who took care of me dical and 
sanitation requireme nts for an army on the 
ma rch.  And it was quite a learned article that 
he had written, long befo
re World Wa r Two had 
started.  He gave me  a copy that I treasure to th
is day.  Now later on, there is a similar story in 
connection with what happened in Vienna.  Wh en 
I came to Vienna, and fi rst I met with General 
Mark Clark who was the American general in command 
of Austria.  I paid my
 courtesy call.  He 
wanted to make certain that I had not come  
at the express orders of Eisenhower because 
Eisenhower was not in command of
 Germany.  I told him I had simply come to see how well the 
American Army under his command was taking care 
of Jewish survivors in the Austrian camps.  

When I came to Vienna and I visited the Rothchil
d Hospital, which was kind of a way-station for 
the Brichah, where they housed Jewish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169

survivors who were being brought from Po
land across Yugoslavia through Broto...through 
Brotoslovia (ph), across the border 
into the Russian zone of Austria, and then into the American 
zone of Austria, and then into
 the American zone of Ger many.
  I me t me mbers of the Brichah 
there who said they have a very important ma tter 
in which they asked my help.  They explained 
that a border crossing from Yugosla
via into the Russian ....in Austria. 
 
END OF T APE  

 

... who had come  there from Poland. They wanted 
to know if that Russian crossing point was 
closed permanently or  whether it 
would be opened again, the reason 
being that they had ma de all 
kinds of preparations before they used that cr
ossing point.  Money had b
een passed from hand to 
hand to ma ke sure that it would be safe to 
bring Jewish refugees across that border crossing 
point.  Now it was closed.  Would they have to
 open another border crossing point with the 
required payment of sufficient funds, with making cer
tain that it was militarily safe?   I said how 
could I help.  They said that by coincidence, 
a sheer coincidence, there was a Russian officer 
who was an aid to the Russian comma nding ge neral 
in Vienna.  This Russian officer's na me  wa s 
the same  as my last name, Nadich.  This Russi
an Jew had come from the Ukraine, that they 
planned having a party in the apartment of one 
of the me mber s of Brichah in honor of the two 
Nadichs, the one who was on the staff of the Ru
ss ian commanding general, and the one who was 
the advisor to the American commanding general, 
that they would supply us
 both with plenty of 
vodka, that I should ply my colleague  with drinks
 until I would get the answer, if he knew the 
answer.  So the party took place.  I was pleased 
to meet my colleague with the same name.  We 

spoke about the Jewish conditions in the Ukraine.  
He told me  of his great
 concern, hi s great fear 
about his return after the war to the Ukraine.  
The Nazis had been there for several years and had 
poisoned the mi nds of those who had not been an
tisemitic before.  He didn't  know what would 
befall the surviving Russian Jews if they were to
 return to the Ukraine.
  Gradually we got around 
to the subject in which I was interested.  I disc
ussed with him the crossing point from Yugoslavia 
into the Russian zone of Austria.  By this time
 I neglected to me ntion before we began to talk 
privately, the other me mbers of th
e Brichah had had left the room, 
and the two of us were left 
alone.  And I tried to keep up with him glass fo
r glass with the vodka and 
then he gave me , he 
actually knew the answer and he gave it to me .  N
o, he said.  That crossi
ng is closed temporarily, 
only for a few days.  Next week it will be  opened again.  As soon as I got what I wanted, I 

continued filling his glass but I stopped drin
king, and soon the me mbers of the Brichah came 
into the room, and the party wa
s over and then I conveyed to 
them the information they wanted.   

 

Question:  Quite a story. 

 

Answer:  Yes.  That was an in
teresting experience th
at I had and I must say it was very, very 
difficult for me.  Difficult because I wasn't  certa
in that I could successfully keep up with the 
Russian Nadich in the drinking the vodka.  And 
I wanted to make sure that my mi nd would 
remain clear until I got the information I was 
char ged to get.  But it worked. It worked. 
 

Question:  Where did you go from there? 

 

Answer:  Where did I go from there?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169

Question: Yeah.  The party was over... 

 

Answer:  The party was over.  I visited several ca
mps in Aus t ria, wrote reports about them also 
for General Eisenhower and for Ge
neral Clark.  General Clark had told me  that he and General 
Eisenhower were taking a brief, 
well-earned vacation in the sout
h of France in early August, 
when the cables began flying from Washington 
about the report of Dean
 Earl Harrison that 
condemned the American Ar my for not adequate
ly taking care of Jewish survivors in the 
American zone of Ger many, and Eisenhower retu
rned at once to Frankfurt and Mark Clark 
returned to Vienna. Interestingl
y I met, in 1971, General Mark Clark's son.  I was on my way to 
Japan and Viet Nam to hold torah convocations fo
r the American Army chaplains serving in the 
Pacific and in Viet Nam and I called upon the co
mmanding general of the American Ar my in the 
Pacific at his headquarters in Honolulu and he wa
s the son of General Mark Clark.  And he asked 
me  about my meetings with his fa
ther in Vienna in 1945.  I visite
d with my friend, my very close 
friend whom I really loved, uh Chaplain Elia
 Bonen (ph) with the 42nd Division, now at 
headquarters in Salzburg.  I visited DP camps in
 various parts of Ger m
any, including the large 
one at Linz .  And then...(Tell me ...) Then I retu
rned to what was my pr
oper base of operations, 
the American zone of, of Germany, Austria– 

 

Question:  What condi
tion did you find the survivors in these camps? 
 

Answer:  That's a very important question.   Wh
at condition did I  find the survivors in in the 
various camps in Germany and Aust
ria?  I speak particularly of 
the camps in Germany because I 
visited them not once but a number of times.  The  housing was not adequate.  The amount of 

food they were getting was not sufficient .  They 
needed muc h better clothing, especially warmer 

clothi ng and decent shoes for the oncoming winter.  They required all ki nds of assistance so that 
they could work again.  In the various camps, a
nd I think particularly, Ireme mber particularly 
Landsberg, work shops were set up under the supe
rvision of some  of the Jewish displaced 
persons themselves. For example in Landsberg, J
acob O'Likesky (ph) who had been the head of 
the program of the art in Lithua
nia and therefore had the experi
ence in setting up workshops and 
supervising them.  O'Likesky headed setting up 
workshops in the DP camp at Landsberg, but he 
needed tool s.  He need impleme nts.  He needed machinery, and I asked for the requisitioni ng of 

that from Ge rman sources.  In addition there we
re German, there were Jewish musicians in the 
DP ca mps.  They wanted to play their instru
me nts again, but they had no instrume nts.  They 
wanted to give concerts again in the DP ca
mps, and so I asked that violins and uh wind 
instrume nts and string instrume nts and percussi
on instrume nts be requisitioned from German 
sources of supply, and they were.  They needed 
athletic equipment, sports supplies.  They 
wanted to play what they called football, but we
 play soccer.  I don't mean all of them did, but 
there were sufficient numbers of younger me n, and 
we requisitioned these supplies for them.  
And there was hardly an aspect 
of living conditions where they didn't need supplies of all kinds.  
Gradually, as the weeks went by, the situation 
in the camps improved, bit by bit, week after 
week.  They continued their improvement during th
e three months that I was at work in Germany 
and they continued their improveme nt  even afte
rwards under the civilian 
advisors to General 
Eisenhower.

Question:  You uh had all these duties, but in ad
dition you had a very import event. I believe Ben 
Gurion (ph) came. 
 

Answer:  Oh yes, yes.   

 

Question:  Would you tell us about
 Ben Gurion's visit with Eisenhow
er, please, and how did that 
happen and what was your
 involvement in it? 
 

Answer:  Well, by uh sheer accident, I was awar
ded the uh by the French governme nt, the Croix 

de Guerre (ph) and I was asked to obtain the 
uh, oh I gotŠI see the puzzle in your face I was 
awarded the Croix de Guerre because of my help 
to the French Jewish survivors during the year 
that I was in Paris and I was 
asked to come from Frankfurt 
to Paris, to the Hotel de 
________where the me dal would be given to me  
by uh General deGaulle.  I asked permission 
from my mi l itary superiors.  I 
was granted the permission, and I was to go to Paris for one day.  I 
took the night train to Pa ris.  I came into Paris.
  I had heard that Ben Gurion was in Pa ris.  I 
found out where he was, at a cert
ain hotel.  I came to see him th
ere, after the ceremony with the 
award of the me dal, and some ti me  before thatŠt
his explains how I knew th
at he was in ParisŠI 
had been asked by General Eisenhower's office to
 comment about a reques
t they had received 
from a certain Mr. David Ben Gurion connected 
with the Je wish Agency for Palestine, who 
asked for permission to enter the 

American zone of Ger many.  And my comment
 was that it would be very valuable for 
permission to be granted because hi s very pres
ence would raise the morale of the Jewish 
survivors in the American zone of Germany in 
the DP ca mps.  So permission was granted.  I 
called upon General Eisenhower at hi
s hotel room in Paris on that
 day that I had come for the 
Croix de Guerre.  I learne d that he  was scheduled
 to take the night American Army military trai n 
to Frankfurt.  I told him I would meet him on the 
railroad platform.  I got there early.  I found out 
that I was to uh be given a bedroom
 on the train with uh an American
 major.  At that time I also 
had the rank of ma jor and uh officers of field ra
nk were given bedrooms, so uh I looked for the 
commander of the train that happened by coincide
nce he was an American Ar my captain who 
was Jewish.  When I, when uh Ben Gurion arrived,I asked him where he was to be on the train, 

and he said that he was to be uh in the co
ach sitting up all night with uh American Army 
soldiers.  So I went to see th
e captain commanding the train, and 
I said to him, do you see that 
ma n with a shock of white hair on the platform.  Th
e uh captain said yes.  I said his name  is Ben 
Gurion.  Does that mean anything 
to you?   And uh, he David Ben Gurion's room said no.  I said 
well, uh he's the head of all the Jews of 

Palestine.  And he shouldn't  be asked to sit up 
all night long in the coac
h.  He said what do you 
want me to do.  I said well, you tell the other ma
jor in the bedroom with me uh that there's an 
emergency, that there's a distinguished guest of 
the American Ar my on the train, that uh you're 
very sorry but the ma jor would have to leave 
the bedroom.  And uh happily the captain followed 
my advice and Ben Gurion was ushered into my be
droom aft e r the unfortunate ma jor  departed.  
David Ben Gurion then continued to ply me  with 
questions about the Jewi
sh displaced persons.  
The major thrust of his questions was, were th
ese people who are completely broken, were they 
hospital cases?   Would they have me ntal problems fo
r as long as they would live, or we re they 
valuable huma n material who could become  i m
portant citizens in Palest ine in the Jewish 
community?  And I assured him for, for from all th
at I had learned that they were indeed in the 
later category, that  they survived because th
ey we re strong, that those who were weaker 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
20 
 
unfortunately did not survive. They were str
ong both physically and psychically.  And that was 
because of their st rength and thei
r will and their determination that 
they were able to survive.  
We talked until two o'clock in the morning, until 
we both fell asleep. In the morning I took him, 
after the train landed, after the 
train arrived in, in uh Frankfur
t, I took him first to uh be 
registered, to be signed in, to the American Army
 me ss. We  had breakfast.  Then I took him to 
General Eisenhower's  suite of offices.  General Ei
senhower was not there at the time.  He was on 
a field trip.  But I introduced him to General 
Walter Beetle Smith, saying General Smith, if ther e 
were a Jewish state now, I would be introducing theprime mi nister of that state.  That was uh no 

great feat on my part.  Of c
ourse Ben Gurion was the leading Jew of the Jewish community and 
it was a foregone conclusion that if 
there were to be a Jewish state,
 he  would be at its head.  I 
was later told by General Smith that when he
 introduced him to General Eisenhower, that 
General Eisenhower was greatly impressed by this
 ma n, Be n Gurion, and that he reported to 
General Smith that he was very much taken by hi
m.   He asked Ben Gurion to visit the camps 
and of course Ben Gurion had come  for that 
purpose, and to report to General Ei senhower upon 
his findings after his tour woul
d be over.  Well after I had in
troduced him to General Walter 
Beetle Smith, and we had had lunch, I took uh David Ben Gurion to his first DP camp, to 

Zilesheim (ph), which was not far from Frankfurt, near the Ge rman town of H____.  I n 

ZilesheimŠ I would come often because it was 
close to FrankfurtŠthe people there we re 
accustomed to my comi ng in with an American
 Army vehicle, and a number of them saw me 
come  in this time too.  A few of the m came over to
 say hello.  They happened to peer inside my 
car in the back seat and they saw some thing that
 was incredible to them. They knew the pictur e 
of Ben Gurion, but they couldn't by the wildest st
retch of their  imagination imagine that he 
would be there in their camp in Ger many.  They  began to scream ﬁBen Gurion, Ben Gurion.  As 

others heard the shouts, they cam
e running, and I was afraid of a ri
ot and I cried out, my friends, 
please show Ben Gurion the discipline of wh
ich you are capable. You 
go around and tell all the 
people in the camp that David Ben Gurion is here and that he  will speak to them.  Let them 
come  to the assembly hall.  They ran.  They ga
thered up the people who we
re there.  They came  
to the assembly hall and when Ben Gurion and I r
eached the assembly hall, we went to the back 
of the stage.  The assemb ly hall was quickl
y filled.  The windows and doors were flung open so 
that people who couldn't get in, who couldn't fi
...get even into the standing room which was 
completely full, could at least hear standing out
side the windows and the doors.  And I came  out 
to introduce Eisenhower.  As the two of us ca me  
on the stage, the large throng of people rose and 
the people began to sing the Hatikvah (ph) and as
 they sang the Hatikvah, ma ny of them burst 
into weeping.  And I mu st conf
ess that Eisenhower...that David Ben Gurion and I also wept for 
the Jews in that assembly hall.  At that mo me
nt, that DP camp, their liberation was complete.  
They had dreamed most of them 
of s o me  day getting to Palestine.  Here, in the form of Ben 
Gurion, Palestine had come  to the m.  The Nazi 
nightma re was ended.  They were free.  They 
were now in touch with their brothers in
 ____________.  And when the weeping subsided, Ben 

Gurion spoke to them, movingly.  He continued 
to break down and the Jews listening continued 
to sob.  It wa s one of the most moving experience
s in my life.  And to 
my dying day, I shall not 
forget it.  He then asked to m
eet with the leaders of the commit
tee chosen by the residents of 
Zilesheim.  The first time I had come  to that
 camp there were only two hundred and fifty Jews 
there, but the numbers quickly gr ew to five t
housand.  That night we me t with the committee of 
the Jewish leaders of Zilesheim. 
 Again he hurled questions at them
.  We re they able to come to 
Palestine?  Di d they want to come  to Palestine?  
 I knew that in my quest
ionnaire that I had asked 
in the camps , approxima tely three qu
arters of them wanted to come
 to Palestine.  They wanted to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169  
21 
 
live for the first time in their liv
es as a ma jority in a in a Je
wish country, that they could no 
longer be concerned about any future nightma re.  
And the remaining 25% wanted to go either to 
the United St ates or Canada or to South America 
or to Australia and he he also wanted to know 
the answer to an important questi
on that he put to them.  I knew it 
was a test question.  He said to 
them, if we of the Jewish agency were to issue 
an order that on a certain day all the Jews in the 
DP ca mps of Ger many s hould ma rch out of those camps, ma r c h across borders to ports in 
southern Italy, would you follow such a comm
and, knowing that you would be ordered by the 
American military to return 
to your camps, that you would be 
shot at by perhaps by Italian 
border police, that it mi ght cost
 you your lives?   Would 
you follow such an order?   And to a ma n 
they answered, give the order.  We will follo
w it.  Ben Gurion told me  afterwards he was 
extremely pleased by the me tal of the survivors. 
 His fi rst meeting with 
survivors, and he saw 
what they were like.  Unhappily, I could not acco
mpany him on the rest of his tour of DP ca mps 
because I had been informed that same  day 
that the civi lian advisor invited by General 

Eisenhower when he  issued the order appointing 
me  as his military advi sor on Jewish affairs, 
the civilian advisor appointed by President Trum
an was soon to arrive in Frankfurt from the 
United States. He was Judge 
Simon H. Rifkin (ph), then of the Federal bench.  
 

Question: What did you do then?   Where... 

 

Answer: We ll uh, Ben Gurion went on his way to cover the major DP camps.  I went to the 

railroad st ation to meet Judge Rifkin who was ar
riving on the military train from Paris, and later 

I learned that when Ben Gurion came back, and 
I saw him again when he came back to Ar my 
headquarters in Frankfurt before
 he departed, he gave Genera
l Eisenhower, as the general had 
requested, a report on his findings.  
He request ed certain things that
 the Jewish DPs had asked of 

me  which I knew could not happen.  For example, he
 asked that the Jews be taken out of the DP 
camps, that whole German villages should be requ
isitioned for them, that the German occupants 
of the housing in those villages be evicted, and th
at the, the Jewish disp
laced persons be brought 
to take the houses of the Germans evicted from 
their homes in these villages.  I knew that would 
be turned down by Eisenhower, and I myself ne
ver ma de that recommendat i on.  Ben Gurion did. 
And  Eisenhower turned it down.  But a
nother request by Eisenhower was honored by 
Eisen...another request by Ben Gurion 
to Eisenhower was honored by the general.  He asked that 
teams of Jews fr om the then called Palestine be
 permitted to enter the DP camps to serve on the 
staffs of those admi nistering the camps, _____ people,
 JDC people, to be of help to the Jews in 
these camps in several wa ys.  To teach them agri
culture so that they would be able to become  
far mers when they would eventually arrive  in Pa
lestine.  To teach them Hebrew so that  they 
could speak the language of the Jews of  Palestine 
before they got there and other similar tasks.  
And Eisenhower indeed agreedto that request, and Jews 
were brought from Palestine and 
brought into the camps to serve th
ese functions and any other func
tions that they had in mi nd.  
And of  course they prepared the Jews  in th
ese camps for the eventual immi gration from the 
camps to Palestine.   

 

Question:  OK.  On that note we'r e going to stop, pause and change tapes.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

Question:  OK.  Uh can you at this point tellme  some thing about Gene
ral Eisenhower and your 
relationship with him?
  What was he like? 
 

Answer:  I'm glad you asked that question.  UhGeneral Eisenhower, I learned years later when 

he received an honorary degree at 
the Jewish Theological Semi nary 
of America, spoke of the fact 
that he and his brothers were 
raised by their mot her on the stor
ies of what he called the Old 
Testament, and he grew up believing that the Jews 
were indeed the chosen people.  And that they 
were the first to bring to huma nity the divine 
me ssage of ethics and mo
rality.  I got to know hi m 

through the huma nitarian approach 
that he took to the improveme nt of the  Jewish survivors in 
the DP camps in Germa ny.  At the very beginn
ing he cut through what 
was a gordion (ph) knot 
with which generals at American Army headqu
arters were wrestling for a long time.  The 
gordion knot consisted of the old question, who ar
e the Jews.  A question that has been given 
much attention by scholars of all kinds.  Are the 
Jews a nation?   Are they
 a religious grouping?   
Are they a race?  Are they a people?  On the one
 hand it was argued that the Jews could not be 
given special attention in the 
DP camps because you couldn't look upon them as Jews.  There 
were either German nationals or Austrian nationa
ls or Polish nationals 
or Czech nationals.  And 
if you were to look upon them as Jews and depriv
e them of their nationality, were you not doing 
the same  thing that the Nazis 
had done, of robbing them oftheir citizenshi
p, and looking upon 
them as a racial group.  On the other hand, how
 could you help them if you did not look upon 
them as a special separate group.  Well, Eisenho
wer cut through that gordion knot and when he 
received these several communications from Wa s hington, from General Marshall, from 

Secretary Stimpson, and I must stress from Pr
esident Truman, that the situation must be 
corrected, Eisenhower at once ma de
 up his mi nd he was going to 
stop with all of this argume nt, all of this debate
, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate 
group.  And German Jews and Austrian Jews a
nd Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy 
nationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to 

go back to their homelands, they were to be 
treated as a special group, given special help, 
brought back to the level of ordinary common pl
ace health of huma n beings and because he did 
that, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors.  He came to speak at the 

Park Avenue Synagogue at my invitation in May of
 1965.  By that time he had been Pr esident of 

the United St ates, and he was living in Gettysbur
g.  I telephoned him and I asked him would he 
come  to speak at a special serv
ice at my synagogue comme m orati
ng the 20th anniversary of the 
liberation of the German concentration camps 
by the American Army under his command. He 
agreed to come .  In introducing him to my congr
egation, I said to them, I want to tell you one 
story about this ma n whi c h will be sufficient to 
tell you about his character, his humanitarianism, 
and his answer to the difficult Jewish problem. 
 I said when we, when the German arm...when 
the American Ar my liberated the concentration cam
ps in Ge rmany, there were definitions of who 
was a displaced person.  Who was a displaced
 person who would benefit from housing, food, 
clothi ng and all the rest under th
e aegis of the American Arm
y.  The displaced person was 
defined as a survivor, in this ca
se particul arly a Jewish surviv
or, liberat ed in a concentration 
camp on German soil.  But soon there came into the American zone of Germany, ot her Jews.  

Jews who had been in hiding in Poland.  Jews 
who had been shoved back by the Russians behind 
the front lines, all the wa y back to Si beria, an 
action that actually sa ved their lives.  Now these

Jews came back in large numbers from Siberia to
 Poland.  They found that their homes and their 
businesses could not be reclaime d.  They discove
red that their loved ones had been murdered by 
the Nazis and the Polish or Ukra
inian or Lithuanian helpers and 
they no longer wanted to try to 
ma ke out, to ma ke a new life where they had orig
inally lived. And spontan
eously they started a 
trek from Poland to the American zone of Ger m
any, later organized and assisted by the me n and 
wome n of the Brichah.   

 

Question:  How did Eisenhower react to this? 

 

Answer:  Ah, this is a ma jor point that I want
edto ma ke.  Whe n th
ese Jews started comi ng 
across the borders to enter the American z
one of Germany, Ei senhower was asked by the 
commanders on lower levels, what shall we do with
 these refugees who are comi ng into our zone 
in such large numbers.  I was asked for a re
commendation.  The recomme ndation of course was 
that they be admitted into the DP camps in th
e American zone of Ger many. General Eisenhower 
approved that recomme ndation.  Eighty thousa
nd Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one 
order of approval, contributed to
 the saving of eighty thousand Jewi
sh lives.  Now my friendship 
with him continued after the war. 
 I was asked to help write items  of interest in his campaign for 
the presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah me
ssage during the campaign.  My wife and I were 
invited to the Inauguration.  Before that time
 I was invited to give
 an invocation at the 
Republican National Convention that
 had that had nomi nated him.
  I had him at my s ynagogue, 
but before that I had visited him at Gettysburg at
 his farm, so we rema in
ed in close contact all 
through the years.  

 

Question:  How did Eisenhower, did you a
nd Eisenhower at the time you ma de this 
recommendation, di d you talk to him face 
to face?   What did he say to you? 
 
Answer:  I did not in most instances have the oppor
tunity of speaking to him face to face.  I did 
often.  I did have the pr ivilege of comi ng to his 
office, speaking to him face to face, most of the 
times answering his questions.  When he was not 
in his office, and that was, that occurred 
frequently, he would be out on a 
field trip, then my conversati
ons were with the second in 
command, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith.   

 

Question:  Di d Eisenhower ever talk to you a
bout the Jews and his 
feelings about Jews? 
 

Answer:  I did have occasion to hear such rema
rks from Eisenhower.  He always spoke in an 
affir mative fashion.  He always condemned every 
kind of bigotry and prejudice.  He hated what 

the Nazis had done.  He issued orde rs, after he 
had first visi ted Dachau, 
that American military 
commanders should bring their units to see Dachau
 so that the troops mi ght know what they had 
been fighting against.  He visited Feldafing on 
Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there, 
told them of his high admi ration for them, for the 
Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them 
to keep their hope high, that they still had a fu
ture.  Eisenhower was that kind of personality. 
 

Question:  Thank you.  OK.  When you had been re
lieved of your post and Judge Rifkin came in 
your place, uh what did you do?

Answer:  Well the first thing I did wa s to escort
 Judge Rifkin on a tour of all the camps, to 
introduce him to all of my contacts among the Jews 
in the camps, to tell them that he was the 
person for them to speak to afterwards.  I return
ed to the United States on a troop transport and 
uh I came back to the United States at the e
nd of Nove mber, beginning of December in 1945.  
Before my return I had been visited at my h
eadquarters in uh Frankfurt by uh Major Edward 
Warburg (ph) who was at that  time the presiden
t of the Joint Distributi
on Committee, and he was 
good enough to invite me.  After I would be discha
rged from the Army, to become  a me mber of 
the staff of t he JDC.  He  even suggested that I 
would be appointed Director
 of JDC operations in 
Germany, after I would spend at least a month or so
 with my family back home.  But I returned 
to the United States.  Soon afterwards I was as
ked to speak at the annua
l meeting of the Joint 
Distribution Co mmittee in New York
.  I was full of vehe me nt indi
gnation at what I had seen.  I 
had, I contrasted that with what I had found a mon
g American Jews when I returned.  There was 
very little awareness among American Jews of 
what had happened to their fellow Jews in 
Europe.  Very few were aware of it, and very 
few were concerned abou
t it, naturally, because 
they didn't know.  So I was angry and at my uh, I 
was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the 
JDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger 
at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked 
to give an address the following week at the annu
al meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take 
place in Atlantic City where an unheard of 
goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to 
be raised during 1946 among the Jews of the Un
ited States.  Of course I uh accepted the 
invitation.  I addressed 
the UJA Conference in 
Atlantic City the following week, and I was asked 
the next morning to have breakfast with the 
leaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at
 that conference, and at the breakfast tabl e I 

was told that I was being relieved of the employme
nt I was to have with the JDC.  Instead I was 
asked to accept employment with the United Jewi
sh Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred 

million dollar campaign from which of course th
e JDC would be receiving its funds.  And I 
agreed and for the next six months I spoke in fort
y different states of the country.  I had no place 
I could call my home . I just went from town to 
town, city to city, and spoke at UJA fund raising 

meetings. According to the calculations that 
I kept myself, some  $20,000,000 were raised at 
those meetings.  The JDC then as
ked me  to return to Europe, to
 visit the DP ca mps in Germany, 
Austria, Italy, once again to bring myself up to
 date on what had happened and then to go to 
South Africa where I wa s to spend four months in
 South Africa, what were then called Southern 
and Northern Rhodesia, now Zi mbabwe and Zamb
ia, and to raise funds there for the South 
African Jewish War Appeal, the agency that then
 transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution 
Committee for work among the Jewish survivors in 
Europe.  I spent a brief while in America.  I 
met the young lady at that time to whom I became 
engaged after three weeks.  Sadly I departed 
on my mi ssion for the JDC to Europe, from there 
to South Africa where I me t the mo st generous 
Jews I had as yet me t in my career.  South African
 Jews gave generously, very generously, and I 
ma de friends among them, friends to this day, an
d similarly with the Jews, the few Jews in 
Zimbabwe a nd Zambia.  I went as far north as
 what was then called Livingston, in northern 
Rhodesia and now Za mb ia, and of course as far s
outh as Capetown.  And I spoke in every city, 
town and dork (ph) in which there we re sevent
y Jews or mor e . And happily the South African 
Jewish War Appeal reported that the campaign 
was very successful.  I returned to the United 

States.  I got ma rried, happily, a
nd then I worked for the United Je
wish Appeal in the New York 
City campaign for six months. Then tired of
 not having had a home  for myself for a good 
number of years, my wife and I settled down in
 the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, where I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0169

accepted a congregation, ______ Israel, in Brookline. 
 And so I started my life as a rabbi once 
again. 
 

Question:  Ra bbi Nadich, thank you very much. 

 

Answer:  Thank you.
