theNazis who cam e topower in Germ any in January 
of  1933 believed that the Germ ans were racially superior andthat the Jews deemed inferior or 
an alien threatto the so

led Germ an racial comm unity.  
 
 
During the HolocaustGerm an authorities also targeted other groups because of  
their perceived racial inf eriority
:  
Rom a gypsi es, the disabled, and som e of the Slavic peoples, 
Pols, Russians andothers
.  O
ther groups were persecuted on political, ideological and 
behavioral grounds

;  c
omm unists, socialists, Jehovah Witnesses and 
homosexuals.
 
 
T oday you wil l have the personalexperienceof  listening to RachelGoldf arb explain 
her experiences surrounding the Holocaust.
  
Letm e just give you a brief introfor Rae.

I would ask you to please welcom e Rae to the stage.
 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Rae, I'm  going to start right inbecausethere'sa lot of groundto cover.  

You have your story
,  
which is really quite amazing.  As I was reading through it, I was really 
stunnedathow m uchm oving around that you and your mother didduring the Holocaust.
 
I was wondering if  youcould start by describing the town that you lived in,pre
-
war lif e. W ere 
you ver y Je wish? 
 

>> Rae Goldfarb: Thetown thatI was born in, that we lived in, was i n a community that was in 
thefar northeastern corner of  Belarus.  Atthat tim e it was Poland. Now it's become Belarus.  
T here were about5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants in the town and about half of them were Jewish.  
Jewish people were inall kinds of professions and businesses.  It was a very good relationship 
between thetownspeople and the Jewish com munity until the Nazis came in.
 
 
My f am ily was pretty well to do. Bothm y parents were in business. My m other had 
a yard good store. She would travel to Vilna,W arsaw, in Central Poland to buy fabrics.  She 
sold slightly wholesale, the rest
 
retail.  Nom anuf actured goods were available.  People didnot 
go to the departm ent store to buy their clothing.  T hey bought the yard goods, took it toa 

seam stress or sewed it them selves.  I'm  sureearly Am erica was probably the same.
 
 
T he population in
 
Poland hadturned com pletely once the Nazis cam e in.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Conditions became kind of  strained.  Jews were required to wear iden
t it y,  a  S ta r of  Da vid  in 
ye llo w
 
on their clothing.  As a child,I didn't quite want todothat.  It singled m e out.  It pointed 
to  m e
 
as som ebody less than the others.
  
I rem em ber asking m y grandmother to s
e w 
 
it on 
white clothing so that it would notbeas visible. 
 
 
For a child9 years old, even thoughm y docum ents said that I was born
 
--
 
I ' ll t e ll 
you later how it cam eabout. I was 9 years old.  School stopped.  Jews were not allowed to 
participate in school.  My m other arrangedf or private classes. W alking
 
in the street was 
intim idating.  If  soldiers, non
-
Jews, were on the sidewalk, anybody who hadbeen wearing a 
yello w star designatedthey were Jews had tostepoff  the sidewalk.  It didn't matter whetherit 
rained, whether there was dirt in the sidewalk.  Nom atter what, you had to step off.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  
C an  
I back upfor one second?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: Sure.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  U
p until this point, up until Septemb
er
 
1939 when the Nazis invaded 
W
estern Poland, you had a very f ull lif e that invol ved Jews and non
-
Jews alike. W ere your 
f riends
 
--
 
did youhavef riends who were non
-Je ws?   
>> Rae Goldfarb: Thefam ily hadm any f riends who were non
-
J e ws
,  
but the Nazis did not 
com e in until 1941. T he Russians were theref rom 1939 until 1941.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Right. Butbefore the Nazi invasion, even in1941, even bef orethe Russian 
invasion,f or thepartition, what was life like?W ere
 
you integrated into society? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W ewere very m uch integrated.  My f am ily hadmany non

m aking decorations,particularly blowing out the shell of anegg, attaching a hat on top, sort of  
in the shapeof  a cone, painting af ace, andputting a string at the end and putting it on the 
Christm as tree.
  
Som e of  m y parents' f riends
 
--
 
I rem ember particularly the Greek 
O
rthodox 
priest who used to
 
com e to 
our housef or P
asso ve r.  
  
 
 
My parents had a lot of contact with the outside com munity.  My f ather was in 
business buying up,ofall things, pigs, which aref orbiddenf or Jews, shipping them  to 

Germ any.
 
[Laughter]
 
Apples.  I know we had a warehouse in the back because ourhiding place was between the 
warehouse andthe house.  He brought up hem p,f lex that was usedtom ake straws.  Andthat 
was shipped to Germ any.  He never went into Germany, but he would go f rom, whatm y 
m other toldm e, would go to
 
the border and it was then takenf rom there by somebody into 
Germ any.
 
 
He also supplied meatto the Garrison.  Sincewe were on the borderof  Russiaand 
Poland, thefurthest northeastern border,he supplied them with m eat. T here was a lim itas to 

how m uchthe Jewish population could slaughterf orm eat. And since Jews don'teat the hind 
quarters, only thef ront of  the cow or any anim al,hem anagedto
 
--
 
with pride, of  course.  That 
was ver y com mon there
 
--
 
to have it slaughtered the kosher way.  And this way the Garrison, 
the soldiers, were supplied with the kindof meat that they liked.  Soon the side he hada 
business selling themeat to the Jewish people.
 
 
Of course, all of that stopped. Actually, the housing that the soldiers lived in, the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

Polish soldiers, was taken over by theGerman Arm y when they inva ded. T he sam ething 
when the RussianArmy invaded. They usedthose quarters, too.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soyour f amily was reall y j ust observant. They kept kosher,but they were 

assim ilated into the com
munity.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: They were assim ilated into the community because of the business context.  

And actually we had non
-
Jewish help inthe house.  My brother's governess was not Jewish.  I 
was taken to church by her.  I knew what todo.  Andthat probably saved 
my
 
l i f e i n  s om e 
instances, too.
  
W e were ver y m uch connected with theoutside comm unity, outside of the 
Jewish people.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  In 1937, around1937, your fatherbecame ill.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  My father came backf rom a trip, becam e ill.
  
Hewent to doctors in Vilna, in 
W arsaw, nobody could figureout whatthe illness was andheeventually died. T hat was right 
b ef o r e t he  R u s s i ans cam e  i n.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soyour mother, then, kept the businesses going?
 

>> Rae Goldfarb:  My m other stepped right in keptthe businesses going
 b
ecause a lot of  the 
fam ily were em ployed in the business, too.  She was a very sm art wom an,businesswom an.  

She was resourcef ul.She knew how to get aroundthe com munity. She knew how to conduct 
business.  Shem ade sure heremployees were
 
taken care of.  Andthey, in
 
turn, took careof  
business f or her.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soyou would say she was a strong person.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: Very strong
-
m inded, too.

[Laughter]
 
>> Susan Snyder:  So, we can jump back to 1939 when
 
the Soviets invade the part of Poland 
that you were living in. W hat was that like livi ng underSoviet occupation? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W ell, school was still f unctioningf orm e. T he Soviets didnot differentiate as 
far as school was concerned. T he only thing was that the businesses were closed.  My m other 
haddistributeda lotof thefabrics to som eof  thefarm ers that she dealt with.  Thearrangement 
was that they would use whatever they needed and they would supply us with some of the 
things that we needed.  So we had plenty of food.  
 
 
Other than we were considered Bourgeois, as you would know it
,  
and they deported
 
s o m e 
to  
Siberia.  And I guess we were f ortunateand unfortunate.  If we would have been 
deported to Siberia, perhaps m y brother would have s
urvived, too.But nonetheless we were 
notdeported.  My m other was a widower at that tim e. T hey'd little bit of respectf or widows.  
So we rem ained in our hometown.
 
 
T here was a lot of  looting by the Russian Army.  I rem em ber one incident where my 
m other
 
hadbought som enight gowns that were ratherf ancy.  They liquidated some of our 
stuff . And som e of the wom en actually wore them in the streetas dresses.
 
 
I also rem em ber m y brother was sick and hehada ther
mo me t e r in 
h is m ou th.  It's 
funny how you rem ember silly things.  T hat thermometer was taken f rom him , out of hismouth, 

and liquidated.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soat thispoint your m other still has thebusiness but she'snotable to
 
--
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  No,no,no. She did not. The business was closed.
  
W hatever bartering she 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

did was behind the scenes.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Food, supplies, things to live.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W ewere not short of foodbecause thepeople that she haddistributed the 
stuff f rom the store supplied us with f ood, actually helped us
 
som e later on,too, when the 
ghetto was closed.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soduring this about two
-
year experience under Russian occupation, under 
Soviet occupation, there is thisfear thatthe Germ ans will e ventually invade.  Did youfeel that 

this was certainty?  Did your m otherfeel?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  I was too young to understandall of that. T he only thing I knew is that 

school was continuing; not the school that I went to. I went to private school.  I went toa public 
school then with Russian children. The language changed, of course. T hey imposed that 
ever ybody should learn the Russian language.  It wasn't diff icultbecause it's still a Slavic 
language.  Andbetween Polish, Russian there are sim ilarities.  So Icaught on quite quickly.  
So Russian did not intim idatem e in
 
any way.  
 
 
T he only thing that intimidatedm e is that, just like in the German youth, so it was in 
the Russian youth. T hey tried to instill inthem  the Comm unist ideas.  And thef irst thing in the 
schools was that you had to earn your red scarf. T hey called it being a pioneer in the Russian 
m ovement.  And I remem ber that was diff icult for me because ofm y standing in the 
comm unity.  My m other was Bourgeois.
  
T heonly wa y to get it was through good scholarship.  
So I could understand th
e intim idation of theComm unist party onthe youth.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soat one point the Germ ans actually invade by 1941.  You haddescribed 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
that right away
.  D
id  
you 
understandthat it was grave because you witnessed som ething.  Do 
you 
rem em ber what itw
as? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W hen the Germansf irst cam e in, thef irst tanks that came through, they 
actually threw candy at the kids.  It was an Arm y com ing
 
in with guns. T hey just m arched in.  
 
 
But m y grandfather
 
--
 
we l l
, he housed someof  the soldiers in th
e  F irs t  W orl d  W ar.   
T here was one soldierthat recognized m y grandf ather. He was actually, at that point,he was 
already of  higher rank.W henhe saw m y gran df ather,m y grandfather recognized him  and, 
of  
course, tried to em brace him because they we re quitef riendly.  Heheld it off.  He says
, ﬁ
I ' ll s e e  
you later.
ﬂ
  
He toldm y grandfather
 t
his isn't the sam eArm y that was here during the First 
W orldW ar.  You cannot possibly in public recognize m e or cannothave any kind
 
of  c on t ac t  
with you in public.
 
>> S u
san Snyder:  Did he say it m oreas a warning?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: As a warning.  Because hecam e laterand he actually brought some 
oranges, which Poland does not grow any.  H e was higher in the Arm y andprobably had 
supplies.  He said that it's notthe sam e
 
Arm y, it's not the sam e world; we cannot bef riends 
now.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  You saidthat you became aware of  thebrutality of  the Germansbeca
us e  
you witnessed the Russian POW
s.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  Yes.  The Russian soldiers, they 
did 
not want to f ight.  T h
ey laid down their 
a rm s
 a
nd went over to the Germans as 
p
risoners of  war. T his was in thefall, Ithink, of 1942, 
just before we were herded into ghettos.T he soldiers were m arched through the street, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
hoardsof  them . They were clubbed. T hey were beaten
 
to hurry up.  They were hungry.  They 
beggedf or water. T hey begged f orfood.
 
>> Susan Snyder: W hat did they look like? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W hat did they look like? People who had walkedf orm iles. Their shoes 
were worn.  Their clothing was lim ited. T heywere being beaten, basically, to go faster which 
som e of them  couldn't.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soyou felt they were being brutalized essentially. 
 

>> Rae Goldfarb:  It wasn't a norm al, you know, m arch of people. Some people tried tothrow 
fo o d to  th em .  I
f they caught som ething, they were basically hit with the buttsof  rif les. Some of  
them f elland they wer e stepped over. 
 
 
Eventually
 
--
 
I did notwitness that,but eventually m any of  them  decided they were 
going to m ake a run for it when they cam e toan area where it was a ver y forestedarea where 

we li ved.  So theprisoners of  war decidedthey'll m ake a runfor it. Of course they were s hot 
at. Thef ront group managed to get away.  Many of  them were shot, lef t there.  And m anyof  
them  m anaged to get awa
y into the forests. And that was the group that organized 
them selves. T hey called them selves partisans or resistance. 
 
>> Susan Snyder:  At this point by 1942 you're living in a ghetto. 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: By the latefall, early winter
, i
n the sam e town.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  InDokszyce.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: TheJews were herded into one area.  Ithink youhave a slideof  it. 
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Can you describe the area?  How did they choose the area? 
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: They choose thearea
 
--
 
the synagogues
 
--
 
the churches andthe 
synagogues were sort of  located arounda large, open area. The churches were atone place, 
andthat was where the marketplace was. There was a big
 
--
 
you would call it here a plaza, 
just an open area that was used f or things.
 
 
T he  s
ynagogues were, again, in a different area andhad, again, abig, open plaza 
inf rontof them . Sothe ghetto was organized aroundthat area. One border of the ghetto was 

a river.  T he other border of  the ghetto was thef ront of houses
 
--
 
t he m a i n s t r e et s
 
were the 
prim ary addresses.  You know, like here thesam e thing.  You havecertain streets that are 

considered higher class than others. And our house happened to be f ronting oneof  the 
streets.W e had a big gate.  Our househappened to be in the ghetto
 
border. 
 
T he back ofthe 
ghetto was towards an area that was kind ofopen. T hey puta barbed fence around it.
 
T he ghetto was not what you consider a ghetto here, justanarea where people live and are 
kind of segregated.
 
>> Susan Snyder: W as it sealed?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: This was sealed. It was like aprison.  Not only was it like a prison, but they 
startedto keep a count of people. They counted how m any wom en,m en, children, how m any 
older people. T hey had a general countof  the population.
 
 
A lso , th
ey organized the ghetto to be supposedly, quote/unquote, ruled by the Jews 
them selves. T hey selecteda comm ittee, a com m itet 
(phonetic) 
they called it, with the leader 
of  the comm unity as the headof  the comm ittee.  Andall the dem ands that were made by t
he  
Nazis were through this committee.

>> Susan Snyder:  Essentially you're saying t hat the Nazis would dictateand f orce the head of  
the comm itteeor this comm ite
t 
to carry out their orders essentially in the ghetto.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: That's right.  The orders weref or Jews had to give upany kind of valuables.  

T hey had to give up anything of m etal. They collected b
ra ss,  
copper, of  course, silver.  They 
wanted gold. Som etimes money they askedfor.  Anything that they neededthey wantedto 

extract.  Them etal they neededf or their war eff orts.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Did 
you 
believe that ordid you believe that was just a way f or them  to 
further
 
--
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  I knew nothing.  All I know is thatall of a suddenwe didn't have any pots
; 
o
nly enam el
, n
othing
 
oth e r. 
 
A big thing
 
--
 
you would know it as abig coff ee pot,a coffee urn, 
but this was something that was f ired
 
--
 
I don't know if any of you have seen it in museum s. 
But it was a way of  making tea,m aking hot water and keeping it hot.  Of course,that
 
wa s  
m ade either of copper
 
--
 
well, som eof  them  were sil ver but they probably were silver
-
plated.  I 
really don't know.  And they conf iscated those.  I rem em ber that
;  
nohot water during the day.  
It was just what we could boil in one littlepot.
 
>> S u s a n
 
Snyder: W hat did you do in the ghettoevery day? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  My m other arrangedf orus to have a tutor
, m
y brotherand I and some other 
childrenf rom  thefam ily.  So we hada sortof m akeshif t school.  My m other was taken out to 
wo r k .
 
 
T he Germ an Arm y needed laundresses, cooks. T he Arm y m ovedby horse and 
buggy, believe it or not, by train. T here werenotm any trucks and cars.  T hey needed people 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

to tendthe horses. T hey needed people to cleanthe s
tables.  They needed people to p
o lish  
their
 
b oo
ts.  T heir boots had to be p
olished. Andnot just polished, they hadtobe p
o l i s h ed t o  a 
shine. If  they didnot shine well enough, they got beaten very badly.
  
They were taken outby a 
watch, by a detail, andbrought back by the detail. T hey were counted when they left the 
ghetto.T hey were counted when they cam eback.
 
>> Susan Snyder: W hat if  som ebody was
 
--
 
had disappeared f rom  the group of  people? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  From  the beginning nobody tried to escape.  Butwhen it became evident 
that this was
n't going to be any good, and, ofcourse, word cam ef rom  other sm aller 
comm unities thatthere were killings
, a
 
group of m en, several men, m anaged to steal away 
f rom  their detail andescape. W hen the count was taken com ing back, they discovered that 
they were short.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  That thesem en were m issing. 
 

>> Rae Goldfarb: That the men were m issing. T he headof  the comm ittee was told to present 
10for one, 10 able
-
bodiedm en, to take thepunishm entf oreach one that escaped. They had 
to select 30 men. T hecomm ittee offered them selves as
 
--
 
call it hostages.  Idon't know what 
else to call it. Som eold people cam eforward, elderpeople,and said they would standforit.  
T hat's not what they wanted. W hat they asked isf or the comm ittee,thehead 
of the  
comm ittee, to select 10 abled people.  
 
 
Can you imagine som ebody putting af inger on aperson tobebasically kil led? 
 
>> Susan Snyder:  And thesepeople were

not com ing back
 
inor is the ghetto liquidatedentirely?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: Af ter thatthere were no escapees.  Becausehow canone escape judging 

theothers todeath? The ghettodidn't last very long. W e were put into the ghetto in sortof 
latefall, early winter of 1941.  In the spring, I rem ember the holiday. It was thefeast of  weeks, 
as you would know it.
 
>> Susan Snyder: W hich is late spring.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W eknow the date.  My m other rem em bered thedate. It was May
 
8  th at m y 
brother was killed.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Can you explain what happened? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W hat happened was that it started out,actually, i n the spring of 1942 where 

they asked peopleto com e tothe gathering place,everybody.  And they actually went to the 
houses to make sure that everybody was out.  And they said they were resettling.  They took 
people supposedly to resettle them  in the large
 
--
 
in a larger ghetto. Howe ver, shots were 
heard. T hey were taking these people
 
--
 
they only allowed them  to take som ething in their 
hand.  T hey 
couldn't take anything with them . People were taken toa sand pit, shot.  Right 
there in f ront.  T hey wo uld stand them  up, run the bullets across them , and they would f all back 

into thepit. T hishappened once,and it happened a second tim e.

T he second time it happened,a littleboy who was hit
 
--
 
they went through with the 
m achine gun.  I guesshe was too small.  Hewas hit in the leg.  Hewas not hit in the head.  
Andhe crawled outf rom  underthe deadbodies andm ade itback to the ghetto.  He survi ve
d , 
by the way.  He survi ved. And he was here in the United States.  And he served inthe United 
S ta te s A rm y. 
 
 
T he thing is this. At that point it was known thatnobody was being resettled 
anywhere and this was just a way of closing in.  
T he  g
hetto was kind of  shrunkenand closed 
in .
  
My f am ily hada big house and sort of L shaped to it was a warehouse.  A space was left in 
between. It was covered on theoutside andunder the roof, but theattic had the connection 
into this place because my father would keephis valuables andhis records. They were, I 
guess beforem y tim e,what were called Pogrom s where there wereattacksonthe Jews.  So 
they needed ahiding place. T hat was probably som ething hisfather built.
 
 
So when,again, they called everybody to theplaza to report,m y m other
 
--
 
m y 
grandm other lived with us then, m y grandf ather.  My grandf ather was a big man. He couldn't 
m ake it into the hiding place. My m other, m ybrotherand Iand several children andm y 
grandm otherm ade it into thehiding place. At that point the ghettowas pretty sm all already.  
W eha d s u pp l i e s  t her e
t
o keepusf or several days.  Needless to say there was no sanitation. 
 
W eheard the comm otions going on. W e heard the shootings. W eheardthe people cryin g 

out. W e stayed th
ere,I think, about seven,eight days.  
 
 
W hen it got quiet, some of the people wentout. And the next thing we knew, we 
heardthat they were c aught. W estayedaf ew days m ore.  I thinka totalof10days.  Andat 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
17
 
thatpoint it becam ealm ost im possible to survi ve there.  It would have beena living death.  No 
food, no water, sanitation was bad.  Andatnight when it was quiet we went out.  At that point it 
was m y m other,m y brotherand I andtwo other kids andm y grandmother. My grandm other 
was not asfa
st .  
 
W ehad another hiding placeunder thef loor. Sort of almost when you cam eoff  
f rom  theattic, in back of the kitchen, there was like apantry.  T he kids came outf irst. T he idea 

was to run into thatparticular hiding place and see whatelse would happen, whether we could 
get outor not. 
 
My m other was the last one in.  My grandm other behind her.  Andm y 
grandm other was caught.  She quickly shove d the rug and believed she was crazy.  T hey 

askedher who else survi ved, and she told them  shedoesn't know
 
anything.  T hey tookher 
away. 
 
 
W estayed in that hiding place until the next night and it was quiet.  Iguess they 
f iguredeverybody was  gone.  W eheard the looting. W eheard everything.  But at that point 

nobody was even com ing into thehouse.
  
S o  m y 
m other letus out. T here weref our children:  
m
y brother,m yself , the two other children and m y m other. My m other f iguredthe best way t o 
get outof  ghetto was to get over the river into thefarm ing areaand the smaller houses.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Into the
 
villa ge s .  
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: She figured that was the best way.  And also,m y parents had very good 
f riends ina village nearby, probably about a kilom eter or twof rom the end of town. W e were 
heading there. T hat was herplan. 
 
 
W ecame to the river, andthere were two gu ards
, b
othof  them  with rif les.  And,oh
,

the rif les came up right away.  M y brother was ver y well
-
kno wn.  They knew who it was.  And 
m y m other had some valuables
 
with her.  Soshe told them , " Put your guns away
.  P
ut out your 
hands, and
 
I'll gi ve you whatever I have and let us go."  I guess their plans were different but 
her plans were good, too. She had a watch,you know, pocket watch and a big chain.  She 
gave it to one.  She wound it aroundhisf ingers.  And the sm aller item s, she said to the other 
one, " I'll wind it around your f ingers so you don't lose it.  It will slip out f rom your hand."   And 
theother one put outhis hands
;  
she loaded up whatever sm all stuffshe had, not everything.  
She kepta littlebit.  Of course shedidn't want to lose that. 
 
 
So we m anagedto run.  She told the two children to run in a diff erent direction and 
told them  where to gobecause shef igured they wouldf ind som ebody there.  She knew there 

were f am ilies and knew their connections. 
 
She tookm y brotherand I to thishouse where I told 
you we used to go help with thedecorationson the Christm astree. This man toldm y m other 

thathe will takem y brother andhis sister would take me. And thenm y m other would have to 
be on her own.
 
>> Susan Snyder: T hey li ved in two different hom es.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: T wo different houses but nearby.  Sohetook m y brother.  W e went to his 
sister's house. W e werefed.  Andall of a sudden one of her brother's children cam e running.  
W e got there at night so it must ha
ve beenthe next day som etim e

am e running and telling 
the sister that hisfather is ver y badly beatenandm y brother, whose name was Schlomo,was 

taken. T hat was enough of  am essagef orher thatthey would come to her housenext to look

People did not have what you call here showers and baths in the house. There was 
a bathhouse.  Andthat was only used once aweek, bef ore the Sunday break.  So she said,

She wanted to know whathappenedtom y brother. She went to her. T hef irst thing she said

I'm asking a question you m ight notbeable toanswer.  
Did your m om  think maybe we shouldn't go into the ghetto, stay out?

question of that. T here was no shelter anywhere.

was taken out somehow without her docum ents, so I gother documents.T hat's how I becam e 

two years older.  Because kidsata certain age were taken to work, too. T hat was a bigger

spinning industry.  
 
 
I actually went out of the ghetto. 
 
Mother saidwe have to f ind som ething to do that 
would take us out of the ghetto.  So I started
 
--
 
I was takenona detail to work in a spinning 
m ill.  My job was to tie the threads,m achines.  If  itbroke, I hadtof ind the endsof  the thread, 
tie  the m . 
 
And that was m y job. I guess that'stheonly thing I was suitedfor.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soyou hadtohave a job,though.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  You had to beof  some use to theoccupying forces.  If  youhad no use, they 
hadthe sam e thing, supposedly being resettled som eplace else. 
 
 
Mother did not wait ver y long.  T hey had onesort of  resettlem ent.They knew what 
happened to thepeople.  Andthat part of Europe, that part of Poland or now Belarus, they did 
not takeanybody anywhere.  There'sno records.  And
 
you keep records.  You know that. 
T here's no records
 o
f anybody or anything. They were not organized there.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  InW estern Europe people were of ten deport

In EasternEurope,especially early on,

they weren' t organized yet.  Fromwhat I have learned,f rom

.  S
o there were no concentration cam ps.  And 
when thearm iesmovedf orward and they didnotneed the Jews anym ore, they did not need

>> Susan Snyder:  Soin Glebokie there was liquidations. And thenyour mother decided this 
is it, we  ca n 't sta y.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  My m other decided very early that shedidn't want to stay.  Alsobecause of  
the three people that I told you 
thathad escapedour ghetto, word cam e that theunderground 
was being f orm ed, that the Russianprisonersof  war thatescapedand afew Jews who 

m anaged to escape had banded togetherand becam e a resistance.
  
At thatpoint the Russian 
arm ies couldnot supply them  with anything.  And the way they got hold of guns and in many 

wa ys clothing, they wo uld capture some soldiers that were on the loose.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Nazi, German?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  Nazis
 
--
 
the Nazi were thehierarchy
, s
o the German soldiers. T hey woul d 
capture them. T hey would takeaway their rif les, grenades, whatever amm unition they hadon 

them , takeaway their clothing, leave them  intheir underwear, boots, of  course,and sent them  
out.T hey didnot shoot them . T hey sent them  out. 
 
Their idea was that when those soldiers 
would com e back, disrobed and sof orth, they would be embarrassed enough thatthey would 

intim idate theothers not to try to go and try tof ind the resistance.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Sowhat happened to youand yourm other then?
  
W here did you go?

on m arket day

m other was ver y brave .  I don't know how she 
hadthe bravery in her.  She got outf rom herdetailonm arket day andfound oneof  the 

farm ers,a very good f riendof m y parents, and asked him  if he could securea gunfor her.  
 
 
Because as a wom an,com ing to a resistance, do youthinkthey wantedher?  She 
was a burden.  However, hemanaged to smuggle in a gun to her.

for sure.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Of course. 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: Sohe handedhera basket with eggs.  And under theeggs was a gun.  It 
didn't takeher long.  She actually tried to
 
getsom e people together in the ghetto to try to 
escape, too. Shef igured if  she would bring a physician with her, anurse with her, that she 

would bem oreacceptable. However, you know, it's f unny butpeople always look outfor 
them selves andf or their
 
worries.  T hatbecame known. T here was an inf orm er som eplace. 
And that becam e known. 
 
 
T hey hadactually dug a tunnelunder the barbed wire, this group. My m other knew 
theplacesto go.  They dug a tunnel to escape.  However that group decided to escap
e 

them selves and they were, needless to say, caught. And that plandisappeared.
 
 
Som other had the gun.  One day on the work detail, on market day, she toldme to 
dress in a certain way so I wouldf it in with the population in them arketplace, with thefa
rme rs .   
Shedressed herself  that way. W e went out to the work detail. Shetookmy hand. W e went 
theother way.  She had the gun with her. She hadm anaged to get

I don't know what she 
had in the basket, hide it underneath.
 
 
Lo andbehold we wer e walking the direction where she took me and a sm all truck 
stopped with Germ ansoldiers

didn't sell her w

whatever she had inthebasket.  If they wanted, they can take it. Of

course there was straw on top. They said,no, no, they don't need it.

W heredo you want to 
go ?
ﬂ
  
She told them  where to let us off. W egot in the back of the truck. W e gotoff and said 
goodbye, thanked them .  She went her way where she wanted to go.
 
 
W ehookedup with a group. It was a comm ando, aforward group. Actually, the 
partisanshad organized them selves ver y quic kly because some of them  were mainly soldiers 
and some of them probably were of higher rank. T hey organized once they hada f ew rif les, so 
fo rth . B u t th
e resistance, everything was m oved by train to thef rontlines. T hey progressed 
ver y quickl y.  If  you know the history, Russians

if  it weren'tf or the UnitedStates, Hitler would 
have succeeded. 
 
TheRussian arm ies eventually when word got to them, som e
 
of  t h e 
escapees went behindthe lines and told the story what happened tothem. So they stood up.  

T hey started to f ight.

it  wa s much  
easierf or women tomove around than it was for men.  And the idea was to try to disruptthe

this group, you know, causea blockage and create this problem f or the German Arm y.

them selves deeper inat the forest. They setup a hospital. They set up a completeArm y uni

>> Susan Snyder: W here did youand your mother live?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W here did we live?  Som etim es slept in barns.  Som etimes we camped

Did you complainatall?  Did you worr y? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: There were no com plaints.  Theonly complaint was how to keep yourself

we were being pushed back.  
So at that point, that group

the instructionswere that you separated so that it's mucheasier 
for one personto hide thanf or a group of about 20 to be together. So mother and I wentone 
direction.  T he Germ ans start
ed topush towards the forest because they didn't wantany 
disturbance to their progress to thef rontlines. 
 

 
Mother andI separated som ehow.  I got lost.  I didn't know what todo. I wanted to 
be shotbutI didn't want to be captured.  Iheard Germ ans speaking across a clearing.  I went 

up to thef ront of the clearing and stoodup there.  If igured let them shoot me. And the bullets 
were hitting sort of  likea f oot ortwo in f rontof m e.  And then I heardm y mother call. She 
calledm y name. I turn

this is thething that I'm  alluding to because you

W hat
 
happened was, the groups

we m anaged to getaway.  T he arm ies were

[Laughter]

>> Rae Goldfarb:  For exposing a Jew.  She told m y mother, evennow, 
ﬁI
t's not safefor me to 
keep you overnight.
ﬂ
  
She gave m y mother the picture. She gave her som efood, some 
supplies.  And she sent her on the way.
 
 
Mother cam e back and she said we can't stay here. Actually, I was enrolled in 
schoolalready.  Anyplace she could enroll me into a school she would enroll me into a school. 
Learn whatever you can
,  wh
atever books you could find.  She would gi ve them  to me to read.  
 
 
As a form er partisan, she was able to enlist

wanted to enlist to go f ight the Germans again

Mother enlisted into a working trai n.  Our

the boxcar was 
divided into three parts and thenagain in half .  The center of  it was the heating and cooking 
and soforth. Then we had a bunk.  Mother and I slept in abunk. W hatever ourpossessions

were were underthe bunk. And whatever supplies we had was under thebunk.
  
The working 
train was f ixing the water towers.  The trainswere running on steam and the water towers had 
to be maintained andf ixed.  Sothat's what my m otherenlistedf or. 
 
 
W e got to the edge of  Prussia
 
--
 
a ll s
he wanted to do was get over to the western 
side of Europebecause word was that the Am erican arm ies were com ingf rom theother side.  
Her idea was to get over, closeenough to get over. W hen we cam eto Prussia, everything 
was m ined to a degree where if  y
ou stepped off  the path, the beaten path, a quarter of  an inch, 
it blew up.  Som e of the Prussian m ilitary m ined them selves in houses. W hen they went to 

rem ove the bodies, they would blow up. 
 
>> Susan Snyder:  I want to jum pforward a little morebecause
 
we're running outof  tim e.  A 
few m inutesf or questions.  Yourm other
 
--
 
you and your mother make your wa y down to Italy 
because yourf ather was very m uch a Zionist
 a
nd believed in the state of  Israel. 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: Theidea was at that pointwe knew
 
that the Jewish groups were trying t o 
help Jews to go to Israel.
 
>> Susan Snyder: T oPalestine.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: ToPalestine at that tim e. And whathappened was, when we got toPrussia, 

shem anaged to getour boxcar attachedtoacar, with bribery to a train that was going to 
further S
outhern Poland. W e ended up
 
--
f
rom  there we made ourway, som eby hitching 
rides, som eby walkin g.  The word was to get anywhere south,to the Mediterranean, to be 

able tof ind a way to get to Palestine.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Soyou did remain there until approxim ately 1947.  But you said som ething 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

that was really interesting.  You saidthat your m other was tough, held it together, was 
am azing, but as soonas you were liberated
,  
that was not the case.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  Notwhen we were liberated. W hen we got to Italy.
 
>> Susan Snyder: W hen you got to Italy.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W hen we got toItaly andwe couldn't go any further, she becam e very i ll.  

Somehow she got asthm a.  W e don't know how or what but sheended up inthe h
ospital many 
t im e s  in 
S
outhern Italy. W ecouldn't goanywhere.  However, she knew thatm y father had had 
a sister. She com municated with her
 i
nW ashington.  But she did not rem em ber DC.  And she 
tried tof indthem .  She wrote letters.  She rem em bered the
 
address.  However, they had 
m ovedf rom  that address.  But whoever was therem ay have recognized thenam e.  But 

nonetheless, the letters came back no such place. W ashington 
S
tate. W here else? 
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Eventually did you connect?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  Yes.  My m otherplaced anote

there was a Jewish paper that was 
circulated called "T
h e 
F
orward."   Still exists today. That she is looking for her sister

law and 
brother

in

law, their nam es,and that they live d inW ashington but the com munication 
came 
back.  My uncleand aunthad written us andtold us to stay; they would bring us to the United 

S ta te s. 
 
 
So they m ade out papers
, c
opies of  which you have in the archives.  My uncle 
prom ised to clothem e, take care ofm y health problem s, schoolme,provide m e shelter, that I 
would not be a burdenon the state, m y mother and I, because I was, you know, still underage 
to provide allof  those things for us.

Again we hada problem .  Motherhad touseher 
w
its again, because asfar as that 
was concerned,
 
we  we r e
 
--
 
she got passports for us.  She keptm y age two years older so that 
if one of us could go ahead, getoutof  Europe.  So if  I was 
t wo
 
year s older than m y real age, I 
would have a better chanceof  going.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Because you wouldbeable
 
to work.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W ell, no.  T he thing was this.  If  you were under
-
aged, you had to stay wi th 
your parents.  If  you were ata certainage, you could go.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Independently.
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  Independently.  So the photo was m oving anywhe re. T he papers,m y uncle 
m ade out thepapers. Mother went to the consulate in Italy in Naples, convincedthe American 
C
onsul that she was born in Russia, which was Russia at the tim ewhen she was born 
because she was born before the FirstW orldW ar.
  
And we got on the Russian quotaand were

>> Susan Snyder:  Let's open
 
it
 
up.W e justhave tim efor a few questions. So letm e repeat 
the questiononce youask it sothe audiencecan hear. 
 
 
Ok.  Nobody hasa question. 
 
>> 
Ho w bad was the sanitation lif e in the ghetto? 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb:  How bad was it?  Pretty bad. W ehad touseouthouses. Water was in short 

supply.  It was very pri m itive, ver y prim itive.  I don't know if you've
 
ever cam ped where there 
was no supplies.
 
>> Susan Snyder:  It was quite comm on in the ghettos not
 
to
 
have sanitation, proper

sanitation. And thusmany people hadT yphus. T hey died of diseases related to it. 
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: T yphus was ver y prom inent because it was a diseasebasically that spreads 
because of lackof  sanitation. 
 
>> Susan Snyder:  Right.  Right here inthef ront. 
 
>> [Question Inaudible]
 
>> Susan Snyder: W hat were your food rations like? W hatdid youeat?
 
>> Rae Goldfarb: W hatever we 
could 
s c a ven ge
.  It wa s a  
m
arshy area.  In the fall there was 
lo t
s  of  c r an be r r i e s
, o
f  course potatoes. T hat's them ain crop in Poland
, c
ranberries.  In the 
spring there were blueberries and wild strawb erries.  Meat was alm ost non
-
e xiste n t.  
 
 
T he reason a
 
lot of the farmers cooperated with the partisans was because the 
Germ an Arm y conf iscated whatever cattle, whatever they neededfor m eatf rom thefarmers.  
Andalso horses. Sothe partisansbasically becam ethe keepers of the cattle and thehorses 
further
 
in thef orest. Thefarm ers would come andm ilk the cows.  Thefarm ers would come 
andtend to their cattle.  But evenm ilk was ata prem ium . Eggs wer e ata premium . If the 

Germ an arm ies came to a village and were able to catch som eof  thef oul, they would take 
them . They would ring their necks and takethem away.  It was a very dif ficult existencef or the 
population therefor the public
 a
nd, of course,f or the people hiding am ongst them
 e
ven more 
so .

 M
y uncle 
im mediately, right af ter Thanksgiving

we cam ebeforeT hanksgivin g.  Right after 
T hanksgiving m y uncle enrolled me ina private Jewish school
 
where I could comm unicate with 
the students.  Hehada grocery store.  And the next day af ter we cam e, his children came 
down to help after school in the storeand sodid I. I learned
 
--
 
thef irst things I learned were 
thediff erent kinds of vegetables
a
nd, of course, breadand m ilk and sof orth. 
 
 
I did learn a little bit of English in Italy because m y mother always p ushed me 
wherever she couldf ind aplace where I could get som e sort of education.  And inthe 

Displaced Persons Cam ps,there were people of diff erent intelligence and different education.  
And theyf ormed classes. T here was one class taughtby a Yugoslav English.  Needless to 
say, m y accent whenIcam e here of Englishwords were atrocious.W hen I started school, 
needless to say, a lot of kids laughed atm e.But it didn't intim idatem e.  Fortunately I'm  pretty 
good at languagesand I can pick upf rom any language. I knew som e German
, s
om e Italian.  
 
And I was able to recognize words.  Maybe not com pletely butat least catch them eaning.  
 

 
And 
we had
 
very devoted
 
teachers.  Ihad one teacher inm iddle school who lost 
her husbandand a son in the SecondW orldW ar. And she would spend time with m e before 

classes in them orning teaching m e sentencestructure.T hen whenm y m othermoved on to 
New York because she couldn'tf indany wor k here
 
--
 
so inW ashington, it wasn't an industrial 
city, she went to New York so she couldf indsom e work which was ver y m inor, hardly enough

to support us.
 
 
I had two English teachers.  One was teaching diction, andone was teaching 
speech.  Eventually
 
--
 
i n the high school they just taught English becausethey needed English 
teachers.  Oneactually got a job later onat the Stroudsburg studiosteaching

It was diff icult. But Imanagedto getthroughschool, graduatedhigh school

class of 598.  I was awilling student. I spent tim e.  Andnotonly that
,  
I worked after school.  I 
worked while in high school
.  
I worked every day for f our hours af ter schooland thenone day 
on weekends.

when I cam e here.  It was f ree.  
Ithad opportunities.  And f ortunately I was able to take 
advantage of all of these opportunities.
 
 
If eelthat m y speaking to you is sortof  like keeping the memory of about 2,500 
peoplef rom m y town who did not survive.  I have too many f ingers to countthe survi vors.  A 
few of them  survi ved in Russia, 
and a few of  them survived in
 
hiding over the partisans.  Ionly 
know of two people who survived in hiding
:  a
 
boy whose parents had a farmand was ableto 
hide with thef arm ers in the vicinity, and a boy who crawled outf rom  underthe deadbodies 
and was able to survive
; a
 
few that were in the partisans.
 
 
I thank you allfor com ing and listening.  AndI hope that we'll prevent 
t h is

happening again.
