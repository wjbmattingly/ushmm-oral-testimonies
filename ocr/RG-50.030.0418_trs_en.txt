STEEN FISCHER 
 August 27, 2001 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Ca n we begin with you telling us your full name? 
Answer: Steen Christian Fischer. 

Q: Can you tell us where and when you were born? 
A: Born Copenhagen, Denmark, September 18, 1920. 

Q: Can you tell us the name  of your mother and father? 
A: My father was Christian Fischer, my mother
 was Katrine (Antonette Fr ederikke) Si egfredsen 
Fischer. 

Q: And can you tell us a little bit about wh
ere your father was from and your mother? 
A: My father was born in a small Danish town
 called Viborg, in 1870, and -- where his father 
had a school. And my mother was born in Denma r
k in ™87, but she grew up in a Swedish town 
called Helsingborg, just across from Elsinore [i
ndecipherable]. She talked fluent Swedish. 
Q: Why did she go to school there? 

A: Her parents had moved over there. Her father
 was working over there for awhile, and then 
they moved back to Denmark. 

Q:  Did you know your grandparents? 

A: On my mother™s side, ye
s, on my father™s side, no. 
Q: Can you tell us a little bit aboutyour grandparents on your mother™s side? 

A: He had a small far m fo -- when I recall him, 
but I don™t really reme mb er that much about him 
because he pa ssed away, oh, guess some where around like thir -- 1930, some thing like that, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418

his wife died about the same  ti me . My father™s
 father had already passed away before that -- 
before I was born, and my father™s mother passed 
away in the early 20™s, 
I think I saw her once.  
Q: Wha -- di -- did you ever go vis
it the farm?  Could you describe it? 
A: No, no.  
Q: You just knew that about them? 

A: Yep. 

Q: Can you describe your -- the 
rest of your fa mi ly?  Did you ha
ve brothers and sisters? 
A: I had one sister. She was about
 a year older. She had diabetes
, and died when she was about 
30.  Married, divorced, no children. And 
that was the only one, only sibling
. 
Q: And her name ?  
A: Inger Margrethe Fischer. She was born in 19 -- 1919.  

Q: Describe what your home  life 
was like. What -- what did -- what was your house actually like, 
or your apartment. 
A: Yeah, okay. We  had ah one of the attached 
houses, you have a long row, and there were two 
stories. Downstairs, living room, dining r
oom, kitchen, service porch, and upstairs three 
bedrooms a nd a bath. A garden -- front garden a
nd back. No garage, no car, room for bicycles, 
though. So -- and that is the 
only pa -- only house I lived in in Denmark, in Copenhagen. 
Q: And did you know your neighbors?  Or how -- wh
at were your relations with the people who 
lived on either side of you? 

A: We ll, my  father believed that you tip your
 hat to your neighbors, 
you don™t get too friendly 
with them. You can get friendly with the people 
down the street, cause y
ou can ignore them if 
you want to, but your neighbors, you are kind of 
stuck with. So we didn™t really know the 
neighbors. The people across the st
reet, o-on -- other people on th
e street we knew we ll. There 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
3 
 
 
was a polar explorer two houses down the 
street, Peter Franken, who won a 64,000 dollar 
question back what, 30 years ago, and had a daught
er Pippanuk, she was ha
lf Eskimo. And they 
had an ice wi nter in the back there and some th
ing like ‚28 I reme mber we were build an igloo. 
That was a lot of fun. Ot herwise, we had an opera
 singer, and we had an author, and we  had the 
fellow across the street was work in the 
library. Have a bunch of kids around, too. 
Q: Tell us a little bit about your 
father, what he did for a living. 
A: Okay. My father started out in -- when I wa
s born he was -- he was working for a bank that 
went broke back in about ™26 - 
™27. And then he bought into paper 
wholesale, and then as a side 
job he was working aud
iting in a savings bank. 
Q: Auditing?  
A: Auditing. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And it got to be more and more time spent on 
the auditing, less and less on the paper. So, he 
kept working til he  was mi ddle 70™s, auditing.  

Q: And wha t  did your mother do? 

A: She -- a housewife. She di
dn™t work after I was born.  
Q: What -- what -- what would she do at -- in 
the home , and did she have help in any way? 
A: No, she didn™t have any hel
p, but [indecipherable] she did a 
lot of baking, as I recall. She 
liked that. That was a big thing in those days. 

Q: And can you talk a little bit 
about what it would be like at a 
fa mily dinner, what the talk 
would be like, your mother and father?  Or 
would your father come
 home  for dinner? 
A: Oh yeah, my father was always home  for 
dinner. We ll, I suppose general conversation was 
what -- what happened in school today, you know, and stuff like that.

Q: What about politics?  Is that some
thing that your parents discussed? 
A: No, they were not that interested in it. My fa
ther was very conservative,
 which is -- would be 
like a Republican 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I think my mother was 
conservative, too, but we didn™t 
discuss mu ch wi -- politics.  
Q: How do you know that your father was conservative? 

A: Well, from what he said about it and from a 
newspaper he kept and some  of the phrases of 
his, you know, you hear when he wa
s talking -- talking with him.  
Q: What about church or faith?  Wa s that some thi
ng that was discussed, or how was that a part of 
your fa mily life? 

A: We ll, we used to go to church fairly regu
larly. Denmark has freedom of faith, with one 
exception, the king has to be Lutheran, or now the queen. But I was confirme d. I was - -  see, we 

went six mo nths we went once a week for a coupl
e of hours, and then after that, you know, pretty 
much up to me whether I 
-- I wanted to go or not. 
Q: Mm-h m. A-At what age? 

A: 16?  Something like 16.  

Q: And was it some thing that was a part of da
ily life in any way, besides going to church? 
A: We ll, I was -- did a lot of rowing I was a me
mber of a rowing club, an
d I did a lot of that, 
almost every evening in summertime, I would go 
out there, row. And then weekends we would 
take off, usually three ma n to a boat, go up 
along the coast with a tent and put that up 
some where, cook. Not always successfully, but -- 
and also in summertime  you go off for a week 
or two with a boat and a tent
. So you-- you know, some where out in a -- some  of the smaller 
islands around. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418

Q: And who -- who -- how did you learn how to do that? 
A: To row? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We ll, you join the -- the row club and they -- they teach you. 

Q: How close were you to the water? 

A: Oh, about half hour by bicycle.  

Q: Okay. So did -- no one had a car in your fa mily -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- everyone have a bicycle? 

A: Yep. 

Q: Really?  

A: Never had a -- never had a car. I didn™t le
arn to drive until I came  to New York. 
Q: Oh. Did your mo m get around on the bicycle? 
A: Yeah, she had one too. My father didn™t,
 though, he used to walk, or streetcar. 
Q: Do you reme mber the ma ke of the bicycle? 
A: There was a -- there was an out
fit in Denmark that made them. No, I can™t -- 
I don™t know off 
hand. 
Q: Talk a little bit about the 
friends that you did have in th
e neighborhood as a young boy, and as 
you began to get older, and that you mi ght
 go out on these rowing excursions with. 
A: What happened to them -- well, for one thi
ng, I went to a boy™s school, and some  of the 
fellows -- one or-- two of them I™
m still in contact with. One wound up 
in a real estate outfit, and 
sat in the same  office in Copenhagen for about 60 
-- 50 years or some thing like that. Then -- he -
- he™s now retired with Pa rkinson™s, pretty
 bad shape. Another one wound up as a -- had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
6 
 
 
bookstore, and one was a professor in some  me di cine. One was the head tax ma n in -- on a small 
island in Denmark. I was told once he was the 
most hated ma n on the island. I guess that goes 
with being a tax collector. And that™s about 
the only ones I know what happened to them. 
Q: You me ntioned going out on the row
boat and even spending the week -- 
A: Mm. 

Q: -- alone -- alone or with some  friends. Can 
you talk about what that 
was like, you know, wh -- 
ho -- what kind of equipment did you take?  How long did you spend -- 
A: Hello ther e. 

Q: Stop for a second. [tape break] Can you describe
 one of these week -- weekend trips where 
you went with a few friends and you stayed
 on the island, you we
nt on the rowboat. 
A: Well, we would leave from the rowing club in
 Copenhagen, usually on Friday, usually after s 
-- after work, and -- which would be -- we leave 
about six, seven o™clock. And of course, in the 
summertime  it™s light  until 11. So you go up the co
ast, and stop some place up there, and we had 
s -- a certain place pi cked out we could stay 
in. Put up your tent and 
do some  cooking and put 
your sleeping bag out. And next day just fool 
around on the beach, just swi mmi ng and all that 
stuff. That was -- that would be on a Saturday 
and then on Sunday row back to the rowing club. 
Q: And how old were you when you were doing that? 

A: Oh, started when I was about 15. 

Q: Were you ever a -- a -- an 
explorer or a boy scout, or -- 
A: No, no. 

Q: -- in any of those groups? 

A: No, no.  

Q: What kind of values would you say your
 father and your mother taught you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
7 
 
 
A: Well, for -- the truth is worse 
than -- the -- honesty a
nd not to be late. They
 tell you that thing 
about not to be late when you 
have an appointme nt. Be on time and be ready. So those were 
some of the important ones. 
Q: And the honesty, what would they 
say about that, that you reme mber? 
A: We ll, there wasn™t any doubt about it, you ha
d to be honest, you know. Or, if you get caught 
not being honest, that
 was not advisable. 

Q: A-And how were you with your parents, were
 you a rebellious young ma n, or were things 
pretty smooth at home? 
A: Oh, pretty smooth. Didn™t have many problems. 

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the city
 at that time ?  Di-Did you leave your neighborhood a 
lot? 
A: Oh yeah, to go Œto the rowing club that was ab
out a half hour™s ride 
or so mething like that. 
Half hour by bicycle. See I started working when
 I was 15, so that kind of changed the whole 
situation. Worked full time. 
Q: Tell us about that, why did you leave school? 

A: I finished school. I started sc
hool when I was five years old, in first grade, and then 10 years 
schools, so I was f-finished at 15, and then I 
got a job, I was supposed 
to start the first of 
September, but they called from the office and 
a -- oh, a couple of weeks early and said they 
were kind of short, could I start earlier. This 
was on a Thursday. And I wa
s sitting -- my mother 
picked up the phone, I was sitting right there, so
 she told the gentlema n, Mr. [indecipherable] 
that sh -- sure, I could do that. 
So he want to know when I could 
start. I -- could I come  in on 
Monday?  My mother said, no, Monday, that™s a 
bad day to start on. So how about tomorrow, 
Friday?  Oh, Friday™s a bad day to start. We ll, when
 could he start?  He can 
be there in a half hour.

So I went out, got on my bicycle, and went in a
nd started work. That was in a Danish Steamship 
owner™s association as a -- as a me ssenger, and 
I was there from August til the end of March, and 
then I got a job in a steamship comp any as an apprentice, and I was there three years.  
Q: What year is this that you st
arted at the steamship company?   
A: ™37?  Yeah, ™37. 

Q: And you say you were a me ssenger, what did that entail? 

A: Ah, well, w-we -- I had to supply my own bicy
cle, of course. I had to drive around, deliver 
ma il, and -- and run down to post office with 
telegrams and all those -- st uff like that.  
Q: So you were kind of a courier, you were moving things around? 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Okay. Why did your
 mom want you to 
start right then? 
A: Oh, I think she knew I was kind of bored. There come s a time, you know, on a vacation when 
-- this vacation, you know, if you wa nt to do some
thing else-- I was anxious to get started 
working anyway. I wanted to work the ships, so
 I was lucky I got into 
that kind of business. 
Q: What was your attraction to the ships? 

A: Oh, I guess your -- Denmark is a small country, 
and I think the fact that
 you always work with 
ships, you know, you -- you™ve fooled around with 
the whole world. You ha
ve ships running all 
over and. You meet people from all over the worl
d.  Wi nd up working all over the world, too. So 
I -- I really liked that . 

Q: What do you reme mb er about the Jewish co
mmunity when you were growing up? We re you 

aware of Jews living in the city, and what
 kind of contact did you have with them?  
A: We  had, in the school, as a 
-- as a routine there 
was religious instruction one hour a week. 
And we had, I think about two Jews in my class,
 Leif Manyas, and [indecipherable] I think that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
9 
 
 
was, and they were both excused from the -- from 
the religious instruction, as a matter of routine. 
And that was really the first I ev
er heard about Jews. My sister 
had a girlfriend that was Jewish. 
Q: So there were Jews in your class, and your si
ster had her -- a girlfriend who was Jewish. Did 
they live in the same  neighborhoods, or where th
ey lived, would they be living in the same  
community as non-Jews? 
A: Oh, sa me  community as non-Jews. Oh, just
 like everybody else. Oh yeah, there was no 
different there, they would live in -- in 
the -- I don™t know if 
there was anybody in the 
neighborhood we were, I am not so 
s ure, but there mi ght have been. 
Q: And in your rowing club, for instance? 

A: Yeah, you never -- you never kind of thought a
bout whether anybody is Jewish or Catholic or 
Muhammadan or Lutheran, whatever they were
. I mean, we all thought 
there wouldn't be any 
difference between a Jew and a non-Jew, for instance. 

Q: What, for instance do -- in the -- the -- would 
you find that the Jews mi ght be me rchants in -- 
in Copenhagen? 

A: We ll, a lot of the stockbrokers, for instance, 
lot of stockbroker outfits
 were run by Jewish 
people, in name , Jewish name s. [indeciphera
ble] was one name -- Goldsmith was one. 
Hanseiger, I -- I knew those people. [i ndecipherable]  

Q: We re there synagogues nearby? 

A: There was one synagogue. 

Q: One synagogue, okay. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And whe r e was that? 

A: In the mi ddle of Copenhagen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
10 
 
 
Q: And did you ever go there for any reason? 
A: Inside?  No, not inside. Oh, 
I passed it often, I -- my father™s office was about a block down 
the street, so I passed it regular
ly, but I never been inside.  
Q: Okay. Tell us a little bit more about your 
job as a courier. Wh
at would you be doing? 
A: We ll, it was a ma tter o-of running around to th
e various steamship companies with ma il and -- 
and me ssages, and stuff like that. Also running  
to companies that was involved with shipping, 
like companies that took care of the signing on of
 sailors, the customs, i mmi gration. Certain o-
official outfits.  

Q: And this is in the mi d-30™s?  1936 - ™37? 

A: ™36 to -- to the end of Ma
rch in ™40. About
 three years. 
Q: When the -- you can think back, and when 
you began to be aware of events going on in 
Europe, what do you reme mber first hearing, for 
instance, about Hitler?  How did you hear about 
him, originally? 
A: We ll, probably, you know, the -- in the news
cast on the -- on the newspapers. I was on the 
vacation in -- in May ™39 in Germany on the yout
h hostel tour, friend of mine and I were down, 
and we took the train to Ha mburg, stayed in a yout
h hostel, that was on a ship as a ma tter of fact. 
And then with a -- with boat, w
ith train, walking, we went down to Koblenz and the Rhine went 
down to Heidelberg, and then we came  back through Berlin, we came ba ck to Copenhagen, 
about two weeks. The other vacations, when I wo
rked for the steamship company they used to 
put -- put us on the ship as a deck boy and I™d wo
rk on the ship for two or three weeks, to give 
you some  idea about the practical 
part of the shipping. And also that gave you a chance to go 
some  of the ports around, see them loading. I wa
s in Riga one time, we we re loading railroad 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
11 
 
 
ties. In Finland one time we were loading props --
 what they used in the --  in the mi nes in 
England. 
Q: Did you begin to notice more people comi
ng through Copenhagen u-using the ships to 
perhaps leave Europe, or to leav
e the country of their origin? 
A: No, there really wasn™t much feeling about that. 

Q: You didn™t notice an increase 
in the volume of traffic in an
y way, of pe ople perhaps going to 
Denmark, and then leaving Denmar k to go somewhere else? 

A: No. No. Then I got called in on the first of Apr
il for -- for conscription, and of course that -- 
on the ninth of April the Germans 
came in. That was a short affair. 
Q: We ll, before we -- we -- we go to that, I just
 want to chart a lit -- a little more what was 
happening that you -- I™m wondering if you could th
ink back and reme mber what your thoughts 
were about what was going on in Europe. In 1939, th
ings began to shift, 
Hitler was a figure, but 
he was also invading, and I w
onder what you thought about that. 
A: Yeah. Well, of course, I was down there in Ma
y of ™39, in -- in the Germany, but then when 
the war started in September, and being in th
e shipping business, that made a whale of a 
difference in -- in the way we had to operate. 
For one thing, there was 
a danger of -- of mi nes 
and -- and you know, torpedoes and all that stuff. And there was a danger 
in the ships going into 

Germany, they were down there to load coal 
for Denmark, and there was a danger of losing 
ships, losing personnel. So, you know, the whole 
thing changed. Actually overnight there on -- 
on the -- the Sep-September, the first, I th
ink, the ger -- German 
entered Poland on the 13
th 
 and 
the French declared war against Germany. That
™s when really the things started popping. 
Q: Y-You mentioned that it cha
nged how shipping operated. What 
kinds of new orders came into 
the ships, or  did they st op going 
certain places because of danger? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
12 
 
 
A: We ll, there was -- of course the minute you go 
to a German port, they were more controlled 
by the German military. In Denmark there was -- oh, 
a lot of things you had to -- to secure the 
ships against ma gnetic mi nes and things like that. You had to put extra lifesaving equipment on 

them, all those kinds of things. You had special 
instructions fr om -- fr om the military which -- 
where -- where to sail, where to avoid. So that
 meant running around and 
picking up instructions 
fr om the military whenever a ship was going to leave. 

Q: Did you go on any of these ships 
after Germany invaded Poland -- 
A: No, I didn™t. 

Q: -- and these dangers began? 

A: No, I didn™t. 

Q: Okay. And what were your thoughts about what was going on?  What -- how -- how did you 

understand what Hitler was doing? 

A: You know when y -- when you are -- when youare 18 or 19, you really 
don™t think that much 
about things like that. There wa
s a lot of other things going 
on. You™re kind of busy, so uh 
obviously it was kind of scary when you -- the Ge rm
ans were never very popular in Denmark for 
one thing. This goes back to a -- a war in 1864 
when Germany and Denmark were fighting and 
Denmark lost that war. And part of Denmark wa
s given over to -- to Germany. That was then 

returned to Denmark in 1920. But 
there was still a lot of nation
al [indecipherable] dislike in 
Denmark of the Germans, they were not very 
popular, never have been. So it -- it was -- 
obviously it was scary when you see what was going 
on in Poland and in -- in -- in France. 
Q: Did you think that it would happen to your count
ry, were there precautions or preparations? 
A: We ll, there was -- you know, you couldn™t have
 any lights outside at
 nighttime , everything 
had to be turned off. You had to be careful walk
ing or driving at night.
 Things started getting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
13 
 
 
rationed. There was a lot of things you couldn™t ge
t. And what ma kes it hard was that when you 
sit in Denmark and you couldn™t get all these 
thing -- movies, bananas, what have you, you 
would see across to Sweden, which is only about
 a couple of miles, all the lights on, and you 
knew that they were having everything that they 
used to get. So that kind of ma kes you realize 
that there™s really some thing 
going on that™s not very good.  
Q: Do you reme mber your father 
talking about this?  What -- wa
s there ever any thought of 
leaving Copenhagen -- 
A: We were-- no.  

Q: -- of leaving Europe -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- because of the war? 

A: No, not in our case, no. I™m sure that Jewi
sh people, you know, they were concerned, they 
would try to get away, but in 
our case there was no particular 
reason we should -- you consider 
that. And in -- during the first World War Denm
a r k was neutral and came  through without any 
problems, so everybody was hoping that it™ll be the same  this time. 

Q: At this point where were you living?  When 
you s -- 15 - 16 - 17, are you still living at home? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Yeah, in the suburb. 

Q: Are you contributing to the family household? 

A: Half of what I ma de.  

Q: And wha t  -- 

A: Which wasn™t very much, though. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
14 
 
 
Q: What were you planning -- wh
at were your career plans? 
What were you hoping to become ?  
A: Yeah. I -- I was apprenticed in [i ndecipherable]
 three year  deals, I wi
ll be fi n -- that will be 
finished the end of March in ‚40. And then I wa
nted to go overseas for f-further training. There 
was at that time a -- a company in Jama ica ca
lled Jama ica Banana Producers Association and 
that was run by a Danish fellow by the name  of Li
st, S.D. List, who was also the Danish consul, 
and I wrote him to try and -- to get involved with
 that outfit thr
ough the consulate. That didn™t 
work out. Then I tried to work something out w
ith an outfit in Sweden and by the time we were 
getting all ready to, you know, do some thing, then
 we got occupied and I couldn™t get out. 
Q: You said you -- it was a three year apprenti
ceship when -- what was 
it an apprenticeship to, 
exactly? Wh at was it that [indecipherable] 
A: Well, it was a three year learni ng period. 

Q: Three year learning period. 

A: Yeah, you went three years and then after th
at you finished and then you can go get a job 
some where else. 

Q: Did people in your country expect the invasion? 

A: No, no, no, that came  as a complete surprise. 

Q: Can you talk a litt
le bit about that? 
A: I reme mb er that morning, I was in the navy 
and we got called out on 
the parade ground and 
there were these bombers all over the place, wh
ich was -- I mean, the Danish ai r force didn™t 
have very ma ny planes, so it was obvious that 
there was something going on and pretty soon we 

were just told that the Germans had come  in 
and they had started occupying Copenhagen, and for 
us just to stay in -- in the naval yard and not
 do anything. So was -- it was -- the officers, they 
were kind of hard on them.

Q: What do you mean? 
A: We ll, they had, you know, some  of them devot
e their whole life to -- 
to defend for Denmark 
and then to be told that can
™t do anything, that™s not easy. 
Q: Right. 

A: But no, there was -- a number of Danes got 
killed, unnecessarily, I thi
nk, because I think the 
governme nt had pretty good idea what was goi
ng to happen. And it was not right for the 
governme nt to expect the soldiers to put up a defe
nse when they knew that there wasn™t a chance 
of being successful. 

Q: So what were your feelings 
about being told not to fight? 
A: Kind of frustration, I guess. I ha
dn™t been in that long, I™d in 
-- only been in for nine days, 
actually. So I hadn™t really -- 
hadn™t fi red a gun yet. But even so, you know, you are -- you are 
pri -- it -- it™s -- it™s pretty
 upsetting, a thing like that. Everybo
dy was pretty uptight about it. 
Q: H-How did the other sailors and people in
 the navy understand what the governme nt did by 
telling them not to Œ to fight?  
How did they ma ke sense of it? 
A: It just didn™t ma ke any sense, because we Œ we
 had been told that this Œ there mi ght be a thing 
like that happening, and if it di
d, you know, then there Œ there was no purpose in Œ in Œ in start 
fighting it. We Œ if y Œ if the country had  bombe rs
 all over the place, and 
th-that -- the soldiers 
are comi ng in, there was -- the Germans were putti
ng soldiers ashore at a 
number of points.  
Denmark™s a small country. I mean, you can dr
ive from the northernmost point to the 
southernmost point in four hours. And you can go 
from the easternmost point to the westernmost 
point in about the same , which we happen to do la
st year, so -- you know, it just isn™t that big. 
And it™s -- it™s not like Norway with a lot of mo
untains and all that  stuff, it™s pretty fl at . The 

highest point is 180 feet, or some
thing like that. So trying to put up mu- much of a defense when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
16 
 
 
you -- a-against the -- the German army is a 
-- a pretty hopeless tas
k, I mean, bordering on 
suicide almost. But even so, though I think most
 everybody thought at least there should be an 
effort. And it was -- it wa s kind of disappoint
ing just to sit ba
ck, not do anything. 
Q: Describe that day. Where were you exactly?  
And what was the first awareness you had that 
you were being invaded? 
A: When I was in the navy yard in -- in Copenh
agen at boot camp, and we just got -- go up in the 
morning very early, I don™t know, 
at four o™clock, some thing 
like -- like this, because the 
bombers were all over the place there. 

Q: And were they bombing? 

A: No. 

Q: Just flying? 

A: They were just flying around. They
 were trying to scare everybody. 
Q: These are German bombers? 
A: German bombers, yeah. And the -- a German sh
ip was putting soldiers ashore in -- in th --  
right in Copenhagen for that ma tter, close to th
e navy yard. And then I had seen a number of 
course. 
Q: So you came out of your barracks, and what
 did you s -- what did you see, what did you -- 
what were you told?   

A: We  just told that there was nothing we c
ould do, and the king had decided we™re not going to 
fight, and we were just going to stand by and then
 see -- await developments. So we -- we were 
staying in the camp for, I guess, about a week be
fo -- before we were -- permitted outside. Ours 
had been assigned a ship that was su
pposed to go to Greenland on the 17
th
 of May. Reme mber 
that day, that™s a Norwegian national day. We  were supposed to Greenland on the 17
th
 of May 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
17 
 
 
for inspection and to ma ke sure that foreign 
fishing trawlers did not
 start going into green 
territorial waters, because Greenland is Danish. So
 we were supposed to go out there and I was 
looking forward to that, that would have been quite 
an experience. But instead of that we went to 
some small port in Denmark and sat there for 
-- until I got demobbed at the British say, i-in 
December of ™40. 
Q: You got what? 

A: Dist -- discharged from the milita
ry. British used to call it demobbed. 
Q: Right. 

A: Anyway, when I was sent home there, in th
e middle of December, that was the end of my 
military career. So it was only about eight month, nine month.  

Q: I™m going to go back just to clarify some thi
ng. You had been trying to get placed in some  
companies, the company in Jamaica and the othe
r company, and then I guess that didn™t work. Is 
that when you signed up to be in
 the navy?  Or did you get drafted? 
A: They have conscription, I got drafted. 

Q: Oh. 

A: So you had to put in your time, and I was all se
t to put in my time ther
e, and I was applying to 
go to these pl aces after the military service was over with.  

Q: Okay. So that first day when the planes we
re flying around, did the Ge rmans come inside the 

naval yard?  

A: No, no. That day they stayed outside. 

Q: And did you have any contact with your fami ly? 

A: No. No, that -- that -- oh, I think that was al
most a week before we could do anything. E-Even 
telephone, or write a lett
er, an-anything like that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
18 
 
 
Q: Did it feel like you were sort of in prison there? 
A: Basically that™s what it was.  

Q: And whe n you finally were able to leave 
or make telephone calls, what had changed in 
Copenhagen? 

A: We ll, of course, there were German soldiers a
ll over the place, so it -- it wa -- it was obvious 
there wa -- it was not -- it had changed. I mean, 
it wasn™t as nice as it used to be. When you get 
occupied like that, you know, it put
s a kind of damp on everything el
se. The stores closed early. 
They were running -- already that time  there were ce
rtain things that were getting short of.  So I -
- I had a bicycle, I bicycled home. Rest of 
them went back to th
 -- to the boot camp. 
Q: What did your mother and father say to you? 
A: We ll, of course, they were -- 
they were happy-- I -- I mean, th
-there hadn™t been any fighting 
go on that I™ve been involved with, actuall
y. But they weren™t too happy about the Germans 
being there.  
Q: Di -- can you describe one of your first encoun
ters with a Ge rman?  I mean, what was that like 
when you™d see them on the street, and they knew you were in the navy.  
A: We ll, I had the uniform on, the navy uniform. 
They didn™t pay any attention. I mean, there 
was so ma ny of them and basically so few of 
us. I think the whole navy was something like, I 
don™t know, 8,000 -- eight -- 9,000 people, which is not much compared to the German army. 

Q: But did you have any inter
actions with German soldiers? 
A: No, none whatsoever. 

Q: So they sort of left you alone? 

A: Basically yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: We re they t-taking over people™s home s at
 all, and using them as offices, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
19 
 
 
A: No, in the beginning, everybody was supposed to
 be -- everything was supposed to be very 
friendly and they took over some  schools, took ov
er some hotels, but not
 any private houses. Not 
in the beginning. 
Q: And wha t  were your friends saying at 
that time about being occupied like that? 
A: Well, I -- cause all I -- I did was I -- I went 
out to my parent™s house 
and spend the time  with 
them, then went back to the camp, so I didn™t ge
t around to talk much to -- to anybody. That time 
there, the Ge rmans announced that everything 
was supposed to be pretty much continued 
operating the way it had been, where the police we re
 supposed to be Danish, and the courts were 
supposed to be Danish, and all that. The basic gov
ernment was supposed to be Danish, except of 
course the foreign office. So they had indica
ted that was not going to be much change of 
anything, which I suppose to an ex
tent was right in the beginni
ng but it didn™t last very long. 
Q: How did it change?  When did you 
notice that it began to change? 
A: The gers -- the Germa ns started trying to 
run more and more things, there were more 
propaganda, there were more thi
ngs in a -- and in the radio. Th
ere were commentators that was 
very much in favor of Germany. Some  of the ones 
that used to be in favor of the British, they 
were not on the radio any more. Denmark used to 
be primarily British or
iented, one reason being 
that the -- the biggest trade partner wa s -- 
was Britain. The Danish economy was a refining 
economy in the sense that they brought grain in, 
and they exported bacon and -- and butter. And 
all that went to -- or almost all had went to
 England and so relationship between Denmark and 
England  was very close. Also because  royalt y-wise there was family-wise between Denmark 

and Sweden and not muc h from Denmark to Germany.  

Q: So what did you do for eight months in 
the navy during this oc
cupation -- period of 
occupation? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
20 
 
 
A: I painted the ship. I think we 
must  have painted our ship 14 times. There wasn™t much else to 
do, we are lying in this little 
harbor, you know, and just keep th
e thing shined up, keep it clean. 
Oh, actually, I was only there for part of the time,
 then I got transferred 
to -- back to Copenhagen 
and I was working for an admi ral, I was doing 
some  office work for him, and then I got 
demobbed i n December, that was the end of that. 
Q: And that was -- was that earlier than usua
l, or they just didn™t need you?  You got 

demobilized? 

A: Ah, yeah. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But normally you™ll be in between
 a year an-and a year and a half. 
Q: Okay. 

A: So it was a lot earlie
r than -- than normal. 
Q: And -- and why was that? 
A: Just sitting on a ship some place, you know, 
there wasn™t -- you didn™t learn anyt hing. And 
they didn™t need a full crew on a -- on -- on most 
of the -- the ships, so 
they just had too ma ny 
people. So that -- told to go home . 
Q: And at this point were 
y -- you get a salary, don™t you? 
A: In the navy? 

Q: Yes. 

A: We ll, yeah, but it -- 25 cents a day or 
whatever it was. It
 wasn™t very much. 
Q: So were you giving some
 to your fa mily, or -- 
A: No, I wasn™t living home . 

Q: Okay. And then what happened when you were demobilized, sent home , and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
21 
 
 
A: And then I and I start to look around for a j
ob, and there was one ad in the paper, there was 
this one steamship comp any that 
was looking for a junior clerk so 
I applied and I found later that 
I was the youngest that applied, a
nd I was the one with the lowest 
requireme nts salary-wise, so I 
got the job. And that was a company called [indeci
pherable] and that star
ted in January of ™41, 
and was there until some time in September, October ™43. 
Q: Okay. And how old were 
you at this point in ™41? 

A: I was 20 when I started, January of ™41 I was 20. 

Q: And you™re out of the navy now -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- how -- how is your life different from 
before, when the Germans weren™t there? 
A: What I see, the work life is entirely diffe
rent. As far as like the rowing was concerned, it 
stayed the same but the day Germany occupied or
 started go against the Russia, they prohibited 
rowing in Denmark. I think because  they were afraid we would row to Sweden, which could 
easily have been done. But anyway, 
that took care of -- of all ac
tivities over th
e weekends. And 
they a -- it was just, you couldn™t go out in th
e evening, you know, you had to be home before it 
got dark. There wasn™t much pa
rtying going on. If they had a -- if you went to a party, it was an 
all night party. That™s in the summertime, that was kind of nice
. That was some thing else.                    
Q: It was all night because you wouldn™t walk home  at -- 
A: Weren™tpermitted. 

Q: -- late at night. 

A: You weren™t permitted to. And you couldn™t be mo
re than I think like three people meeting in 
the street, be -- anything beyond that
 was illegal. Stuff like that.  
Q: At what point do you begin to hear about
 friends or countryme n beginning to resist? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
22 
 
 
A: That was probably in ™40 -- ™
42, I think. That™s when the -- th
e illegal papers started comi ng 
out. We always tried to listen to the British foreca
st, news in the evening, and the --  the illegal 
newspapers started some where around that time, la
te ™40 -- ™41, I think it 
must have been. So I 
want to get involved and I -- a friend of my mo
ther was ma rried to a chap that was in the 
newspaper business. So I went to see him -- went 
in to see him one day and told him that I was -- 
kind of like to get involved with some of that 
stuff there, and so he hemmed and hawed a little 
bit, he wasn™t going to admit he
 was involved, but he said why you 
come  back in a week, and so 
on. So I came back a week later on, he said okay, here™s a -- a name  of a guy, you could go and 

talk to him. So I went down to see this fellow 
and he was pretty deep in one of the illegal 
newspapers. I don™t remember the name , free Danes,
 what it was. But there was quite a few of 

them. The students had one, the Communists ha
d one, the Republicans had one. I mean, there 
were a whole batch of 
those being published. 
Q: But do y -- why do you think your mother™s fr
iend trusted you enough to send you to the -- to 
the other person? 

A: Oh, they knew me  pretty well. I 
mean, they™d known me  for years.  
Q: And whe n you went to see the person who was very involved -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- you thought ma ybe the paper was called free Danes,
 just tell us a little
 bit about what that 
meeting was like. What did he ask you?  What did you say to him?  

A: We ll, I told him that I was, you know, where 
I came from and that I would like to -- to get 
involved with some  of the stuff and I told 
him what I -- my background, you know, fr om the 

navy, and -- and the steamship comp any, and all that
. And that I was ready to do whatever was, 
you know, with -- with a newspaper, either distributi
on or -- or to run copies
 of it, or whatever 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
23 
 
 
was. And he just said well, I™ll talk to you one
 of these days, and then I went home and then a 
few days later I got word, I had to go -- come  back in. And he ha -- must have done a little 
checking other ways.  So I came back in and he sa
id okay, let™s get at it. Then I went some where, 
I don™t know where -- I don™t reme mber where it wa
s, but I went to th
is address and -- and 
started running copies 
of this paper. And -- 
Q: And whe n you got to the address, what woul
d you say?  Ho-How would th -- you assure them 
that you were to be trusted?   
A: I guess the fact that I came from the other cha
p. So then we -- we would run newspapers off, 
and then we would take care of the distribu
tion, and then kind of 
one -- one thing took you, you 
know, it -- you get more and more involved, get more and more ma d at the Germans. So you get 

-- you get really -- you -- you -- you get 
pretty satisfied that you th
ink that what you™re doing is 
not going to change the war, obviou
sly. But at least, under the circ
umstances, it™s kind of more 
or less the most you can do. You can™t do a he
ck of a lot mor e  than that, under those 
circumstances. But that was a beginning. And in 
those years there wasn™t much sabotage or any 
of that stuff going. That came later. 

Q: What gave you the desire to resist? 

A: We ll, my  whole career being ruined by this 
stuff, in a sense, you know, I mean here I was 
trying to get to Jama ica or -- or  whatever, and th
-that™s all ruined because they came in there. 
And after all, there wasn™t much reason for the Germ
ans coming in, just the fact that they want to 
be sure that they would get the Swedish ir
on ore down along the coast of Norway, and they 
wanted protect a -- protect th-the
 ships. Didn™t seem to be any 
particular reason for them to 
occupy Denmark and ruin my career, two of them at
 the same time. So I 
just didn™t like it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
24 
 
 
Q: Ca -- the place where you ma de the newspapers, 
what -- where was it?  Was it in a -- a hidden 
place, or  -- 
A: Oh, some body™s base
ment somewhere.  
Q: Okay. And there was a printing press down there? 

A: No, it was a duplication. Every time  around you get one sheet, you know, and there was a lot 

of times around, and then you had to put them t
ogether o-on -- you had to take them out and -- 
and distribute them. We  had to 
be a little bit careful when you 
do that, too. But there we re var-
various ways you could do that, one
 was to go into an apartment 
-- a high-rise, and then start 
from the top and leave one paper in front of each 
door and just run down as fast as you could and 
get out of there, in case there was some Ger man
s living somewhere in an apartment. The other 
thing was driving around on a bicycle, if you see a 
bunch of people standing, say at a -- say at a 
bus stop, you throw a bunch of papers over there a
nd then you peddle around th
e corner as fast as 
you can. That worked pretty good, too. And then, of
 course there was the steady customers, you 
know. So, oh, ma ny wa ys of getting rid of them.  

Q: When you would go out to dist
ribute, did you ever alter your a
ppearance in any way so that -- 
A: No. No, cause you don™t thi
nk anybody™s going to see you. I mea
n, if you run down the stairs 
pall mall all the doors are closed. 
And if you just throw the papers
, people are not going to get 
that much of a chance to really look at you so 
they can report you, and so no, there wasn™t much 
problem with that one. 

Q: What would have happened if you™d been cau
ght with those newspapers, or ma ybe you were 
at one point? 
A: No, I never got caught  with the newspapers
. In the beginning the Danish poleesh -- police 
would have pick you up and probably put you in the 
jail for a week or two. It was illegal to do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
25 
 
 
that stuff, officially it was illegal. You weren'
t supposed to do that. But it, you know, it wasn™t 
any major crime as such. And at that time, the -- 
the Germans were not in working as the police, 
or they were not -- didn™t have any judges around.
 We ™re talking about ™41 - ™42, and things got 
hotter after that. 
Q: Can you tell us about that? 

A: Well, then in -- in -- was in f-fort -- I mean 
in ™40 -- kind of hard to reme mber what happened 
what year. The -- the Germans threw the police out that is after I got in court. The Germans 

started to get more and more involved, as alwa
ys, the police. And they
 started controlling a 
bunch of the courthouses, so if you did get caught,
 you could get really pu
t in the slammer by the 
-- by the police. Also, the -- I think the Germans insist ed the po
lice pi ck up all the Communists 

and put them in the camps some where. And it -- 
it -- it™s kind of hard to reme mber what 
happened, what year that is.  

Q: Did you ever assume  another name ?  
A: Oh yeah. Yeah, everybody had a number of na
me s. And t hat wa -- that™s the reason people 
now, ask me  do you, you know, whatever, and what 
was his name  during the war, you know -- 
oh, you know, some thing entirely different. I don™t 
reme mbe r  the name s I used, but I know I had 
an I.D. card for several. But that was kind 
of standard -- standard
 -- everybody did that. 
Q: How did you get those I.D. cards? 
A: Well, ther e were --  there were people in offi
cial offices, that didn™t 
like the Germans either , 
and they kind of slid it to you under the table, 
you know. That was not that
 difficult to get ahold 
of. You had an I.D. card, you get a driver™s 
license, you get, you know, most -- you get rationing 
stamps too, which, you needed them that time if 
you wanted legal -- when you became illegal. So 
you™d get all these things. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
26 
 
 
Q: Okay, we™ll stop. 
A: Okay. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
27 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two  
Q: Can you tell us any name  you reme mb
er that you used during that period? 
A: I™m pretty sure of -- I used Jorgen for awhile
. But, I mean, then after the war, right after the 
war when I came back th-the liberation, then I ha
d different name s and diffe
rent cards. I -- I can™t 
tell you, changing our name s, can™t reme mber.  
Q: And you me ntioned that you mi ght
 not use a name for very long. 
A: Yeah. Yeah, we never knew whether whether 
-- particularly, you know, after the Ge rman got 
real hot you never knew whether th
ey knew of one of your name s and it mi ght -- if -- if you got 
picked up for some thing not very important, th
at mi ght re mi nd them of some thing that would 
have been important. 
Q: Wh- Whe n did you begin to th
ink of yourself as some one w
ho was resisting the Germans?  
A: The whole thing come s gradual. I mean, that
 i-isn™t one day all of a sudden, boom. And th-th-

the thing was, everybody was -- was involved al
l -- no, I shouldn™t say everybody, an awful lot 
of people were involved, get to be more and 
more all the time. So it was nothing unusual. I 
mean, later on during the war, when I was in jail,
 my sister wa s involved with a newspaper, my 
father contributed, and my mother would feed these fellows. The old system, you know, where 

you have the plant in the -- in the left side of 
the window stay away, and 
the right side of the 
window, come  on in and eat. So I -- everybody was ki
nd of involved one way or the other, and I 
-- me -- I can™t say th-t hat this happened this time or
 that  time. I -- I -- that I™d realized of -- how 
deep it was. It just get deep
er and deeper all the time .  
Q: Are you living at home at this point where you begin to do the underground newspapers? 

A: Correct.  

Q: Did you tell your parents you were doing this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
28 
 
 
A: I don™t think I really told th
em outright, but I™m pretty sure 
they knew what was going. I mean 
that -- you didn™t -- you don™t run ar
ound and talk much about thos
e things there, to anybody.  
Q: We re you a me mber of any organization then?  
I mean, at some  point did you affiliate with 
one of the underground organizations? 
A: We ll, you don™t really join as a -- as a me mbe r sh
ip card and all those ki
nds of things. You just 
kind of get involved, you work with them. 
I don™t think this newspaper group had any 
me mbership roster or anything like that, you know,
 which would have -- not have been a very 
practical thing in case a Germ
an had gotten hold of it. 
Q: But you would go there and you™d run off the ne
wspapers, organize them and distribute them. 
Who would tell you where to distribute them? 

A: I don™t really reme mb er. I th
ink you kind of worked that ou
t between yourselves, you know, 
that -- pretty much what ar
ea you were going to cover.  
Q: And whe n you were together with the peopl
e, let™s say working on 
the newspapers, what 
would your conversations be like?  Would you be 
talking about other things you could possibly 

do, or the wa r, or -- 

A: We ll, nights you -- you would talk about the news
 that was in the -- in the paper that day, and 
other things that you mi ght have 
heard that hadn™t gotten in th
e paper yet. You couldn™t have 
everything in the paper, it was just a few mi me og
raphed sheets. And as time  went by there were -
- there were just more and more things happeni
ng all the time . So you c
ouldn™t put everything in 
there, so you would exchange news, what was happening. 

Q: What other kinds of th
ings did you do to resist? 
A: Well, it st arted out with the papers. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
29 
 
 
A: And then in the fall of ™43, the whole thing 
came  up with the -- with 
the Germans wanted the 
Jews to the camps in Ge rmany. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: [indecipherable] intelligence th
at what they want. Anyway, th
ey came up, and that must have 
been September, October of ™43. 

Q: This was when the Germans were going 
to actually round up the Jewish population? 
A: That™s correct . 

Q: Right around the weekend of Ros h Hashanah. 

A: Yeah. And there was a -- a fellow in the Germ
an embassy, Dukritch or something like that, he 
was the shipping attaché, and he knew about it, and he had told some  of t he Danish politician 
about it, and they had passed word out to who th
e Chief Rabbi was told to -- about it. And of 
course that went down the ranks, pretty soon we
 heard about it and then
 we started getting -- 
having the Jews getting away to Sweden. You ha
d -- you had to get out and -- and -- and warn 
them, and then find out where they were going to 
be staying because a lot of them moved away 
from their own house. And then they would pick th
em up and take them out 
in the countryside to 
where the fishing boats were.  

Q: But let™s go through that process, I mean, 
how do you remember hearing about it and saying 
okay, I™m going to go warn some  fa milies?  How did it actually work? One -- you know, give us 

one day, one day that you helped. 

A: Details, they are some what blurred. There wa
s one fellow, he was a doctor, he and his wife, 
they had one child, and as I recall some body asked 
me  whether -- whether he had taken off, and I 
said, I don™t know, but I™ll check him. So I went to
 see him, and -- and he was still there. So I 
said to him, well, you know, you better start movi
ng. So he and his wife and the -- and the kid, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418

took them to a safe house and then I don™t know if it 
was that night or the ne
xt night, I took them 
out to a small town called Taarbek, that™s on the 
coast just north of Copenhagen, and got them on 
a boat to Sweden. That kind of the way it work
s. You hear about some body who is some where 
and then you go out there and -- and the amazing th
ing was that -- I mean, I was what, 22 at that 
time, 23, and you go out and talk to a -- a family, 
you never see them before in your life, and you 
say, hey I™m here to -- to help you ge
t away, and they go to -- go with you. 
Q: No hesitation? 

A: No. We ll, you know, they were desperate. A
nd I guess that, what was the choice? There was 
going to Theresienstadt and that 
was not that desirable. So wh
en you come  there an-and tell 
them, hey, I™ll help you get to Sweden, and they -- they are inclined
 to go along with you. 
Q: So you went to his house, and then how di
d you get them to a safe house?  Did you have to 
wait until the evening to do that? 
A: There were certain taxis we could use and th
ere were certain ambulances. There was a -- there 
was a Dr. Ole Sager at the hospital who was very i
nvolved with all this stuff, and we c ould also, 
through him get an ambulance, and take them out to
 a safe house. And then in the evening there 
was certain taxis that were, yo-you know, th-the dr
ivers were considered safe. Then take them -- 
get ahold of one of them to ta
ke them out to Taarbek, it was 
called, just north of Copenhagen. 
And there was an inn ri ght ther e, ri ght on the water,
 right in the harbor, so put them in a -- they 
had a big meeting room -- ballroom I guess it was, 
and they would go in there and wait, and then 
during the night the fisherma n decided when they
 were ready to go, and then you walked them 
down, you get them on the boat, and they took off.  

Q: So they -- 

A: We  never loosed one -- lost one. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
31 
 
 
Q: When they would be in the inn, they were 
in a big ballroom?  How 
ma ny people were in the 
ballroom?  
A: We ll, that all depends upon how ma ny boats 
you had lined up for the night, but you couldn™t 
put that ma ny people on board, I don™t know how
 many -- how many it was, it was 12 - 15 or 

some thing like that, on the fishing boat, it
 wasn™t very big. But you mi ght have, you know, 
enough for four or five boat. One time we had 
the place full and all a -- all of a sudden rumor 
started that the Gestapo was comi ng around. 
So everybody had to get outside and hide 
some where. There were houses around it, you had to 
hide in the garden and all that stuff, that 
was bit of a mess. 

Q: Did the Gestapo come  that time ?  

A: No, that was false rumors, we go -- we got 
everybody back in the -- in
 the ho -- inside, and 
then down on the -- on the fishing boat and they took off then. 

Q: S-So when the fisherma n were ready, you woul
d go and get the people you were in charge of 
and walk them through the -- the coast, right up to the -- 

A: It wasn™t very far. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I mean you were in the harbor -- 

Q: Okay, okay. 

A: -- so you just walk down the pier to where th
e fishing boat was, and then they go aboard, then 
they take  off. Whenever the  fisherma n is ready. 
Q: Do you think people in the town besides th
e innkeeper and the fisherme n kne w what was 
going on?  

A: I™ll be very surprised if they didn™t. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
32 
 
 
Q: If they didn™t? 
A: Oh yeah. I mean, you know, you have a lot of
 people running around th
ere in the mi ddle of 
the night when you™re not supposed to be outside. So obviously they know that some thing is 

cooking. And a lot of the fisherme n lived there, 
so naturally their families would know about it. 
Q: So this was a -- an effort of ma ny pe
ople in a sense, as a sort of network? 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 

Q: That -- 

A: I ope -- 

Q: Uh-huh? 

A: No, I was just going to say there were -- 
had -- so happened that the people I was working 
with used this port at Taarbek. There were ot
her people who used ports
 south of Copenhagen. 
There were some using ports north of -- there was one port north of Copenhagen called Gilleleje 
and one time they had several Jews hidden in the -- in the church, and so
mehow or the other the 
Gestapo found out, and picked them all up, and they
 all wound up in -- I th
ink they all went to 
Theresienstadt. But that was one of the few tim
es  anybody were lost. One time we were just up 
around Elsinore, and we were help
ing some  people over and the Germans came and they started 
shooting, and one guy, he was a policeman, Larsen I 
think his name  was, hit him in the stomach, 
which is pretty mi serable. So I wasn™t involvedwith that, they got him 
down to -- to the hospital 
where Hulsaker was and they operated on him and 
they shipped him to Sweden the next evening 
to a hospital an-and he came  through okay. 

Q: Did you yourself ever go 
on one of the boats over? 

A: Mm-hm, yeah. 

Q: Could you describe what
 that trip is like? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
33 
 
 
A: I went over three time s. The first time  I wa
s told to go because some how or the other they 
said that -- that some body in -- in -- in the Germans 
I ha -- knew I was involved with the stuff, so 
they said, you better get over to 
Sweden for awhile, lay low. So I went on a boat, and we went 
about halfway across to Sweden, and then there 
was the Swedish fishing boat. And the two of 
them went alongside, and we climbed over in th
e Swedish fishing boat and then went over to 
Sweden. So -- 
Q: How does that transfer actually work
?  It seems like it could be dangerous. 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: No?  To go -- you would physically just jump -- 
A: From one  fishing boat they were -- 
they were right next
 to each other. 
Q: Go right next to
 each other, okay. 
A: They go slow ahead you know, so -- 

Q: Okay. 
A: No, that wasn™t any problem. 
That was one time. Another time I went over there, there was a 
brewery in a small town, Elsinore, that™s Haml
et™s Castle, called Wiibroe, and they had an 
arrangement with a boat that would go from C
ope nhagen to Elsinore, which is some thing like 20 
miles, with empty beer bottles and cases. We ll, 
they would leave a room in the mi ddle of the -- 
of the hold, so you would hide down there. And th
e time I -- I forgot the reason, I had to get over 
there, was some thing I had to bring over and 
there was a couple with a baby that was going on 
the same  one. And th-the baby had gotten a shot, 
you know, of -- to be sure it was quiet, because 
when you get down there, then they put beer bo-- case with beer bottle
s all the way around, and 
then the -- before the ship could 
leave Copenhagen the German harbor
 patrol or whatever it was, 
will come  down as a ma tter of orde
r and just check the ship out. 
So you could hear them walking 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
34 
 
 
around on the deck. And then we took off, and we
 got out on the sound and then the same  thing 
alongside the Swedish fishing boat,
 and they take some  of the 
beer cases away, and so you get 
out. 
Q: What kind of shot did the baby get to be quiet?   
A: I have no idea. There was a -- there was a doc
tor they had. But that was something there  to 
calm her down you know, it wouldn™t ma ke any -- it 
wouldn™t ma ke her cry or anything like that. 
Q: At that mo me nt when you were sort of hidden 
in this little area surr
ounded by beer cases, and 
you can hear the Nazis wa lking around, what™s
 going through your mi nd?  What -- what are 
people thinking and feeling? 

A: That wa -- that was one of the three scarie
st mome nts I -- I had dur
ing the war. I-I t™s -- it™s 
scary. You know, you -- you don™t want to do that t
oo often. But we were lucky the baby stayed 
quiet, and -- and so we got off in good shape. 

Q: And you said th -- what was the th
ird scariest mome nt
 [indecipherable] 
A: Oh, the second time was -- well that was actua
lly after I had been caught by the Ge stapo had 
been in the jail for awhile, they were going to 
bring us down to Germany, they stopped -- they 
stopped the car some where, there we re 13 of us 
in the -- in this truc
k. And you sit there, you 
handcuffed with your -- in the back and you 
have a -- a wire going through so nobody get 
anywhere. So they went from Copenhagen down 
to [indecipherable] over the ferry to the island 
Funen and then we went a piece on this blacktop 
and then you could feel that you were going on 
a -- on a dirt road. And then they stopped and th
ey  told us to get 
out, they took the -- the 
handcuffs off and said, time  to relieve yourse
lf. So you stand there do
ing your thing and we 
knew that shortly before that the Germans -- the 
Gestapo had taken a bunch of fellows from the 
camp out some where in the 
northern part of Zealand 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
35 
 
 
and they shot them all. So when you™re do -- st
anding there doing that thing, one of the German 
soldiers fi red a -- a salvo, this machine pist ol there.
 That was pretty scary. But he just fired in the 
air, you know, for the fun of it, or whatever, so 
-- and the third time was another time I™d been in 
Sweden, I came back to Copenhagen in an afternoon, and that was my own stupidity. I had 
bought a copy of the London Time s, and I had that
 in my briefcase, and I was sitting the 
streetcar, and through one end of 
the streetcar come  these German soldiers and start -- want to 
check everybody™s briefcase. Fortunately, before 
they got to me  they stopped and they got off 
and went some where else. But that was -- I 
-- I was very scared, I -- I™ll ad mit that. 

Q: We re you scared a lot when you were
 doing this kind of resistance work? 
A: I -- I think so, yeah. Y-You don™
t really get that used to it. 
Q: Can we go back to that two week period wh
ere so ma ny of the Jews were saved in your 
country. 

A: ™43 -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: Fall of ™43. 

Q: Fall of ™43. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: It™s been described as a -- as some  sort of
 a two week period and there™s a stream of people 

going over to Sweden. I-In that two week peri
od, what -- what was going on for you?  Were you 
just sort of up every day, hardly sleeping, or
 -- what was going on for you?  Ho -- were you 
getting assignme nts of ot
her people to help, or -- 

A: You don™t get much sleep, that™s one thing. And 
they had some kind of pill, I don™t reme mber 
the name of it, that 
I -- could keep you going for a long 
time . But usually, after two nights 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
36 
 
 
without hardly any sleep, then you had to have on
e night. The company I work for, I -- I worked 
ow -- a lot of times I -- I didn™t show up, but th
ey -- I think the boss knew very well what was 
going on -- he didn™t ask me , I didn™t tell him, bu
t I think he knew what was happening. So then 
after, you know, two -- two or th
ree weeks, then it st
arted easing off, and -- and you wouldn™t be 
on every night any more.  
Q: But when you say you™re on, how do you know you™re supposed to be on?  Does some one 

come  and tell you we need you tonight? 

A: We ll, you know, you -- you -- you 
-- you talk to these people 
all the time . Whether they 
specifically said -- I -- I -- I 
don™t reme mber. I just don™t reme
mber now. I -- I™m s orry. It™s a 
long time ago, you know, and I tried lot of things in 
between, so some of them -- those things in 
that time, you know, they kind of -- I™ve forgotten about them. 

Q: Wa s there a point that you became known and re
lied upon for the work that you™re able to do 
in the resistance? 
A: Oh, I suppose some  of the fellows or the gi
rls I worked with, you know, they kind of respect 
each other. There were a couple of fellows that 
were really out -- there 
was one girl that was 
outstanding, that 
I knew quite well. 
Q: And who  was that? 
A: The girl™s name  was Jette Hec Johansson, sh
e was quite we ll known, she was a great girl. And 
the fellows, oh God, what was their name s?  Hec 
Johan -- Hed I reme mbe r  her name because I 
me t her, oh what, 10 years ago at a reception 
in Copenhagen the queen had. And Jette was 
invited and I was there, and so I happened to se
e her, and I hadn™t seen her for so long, I went 
over to say, You™re Jette, aren™t you? That was 
it. So we had a -- a great reunion. Yeah, she was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
37 
 
 
wonderful person. So that was -- that was a 
bunch of -- of nice g -- nice people, you know, 
reliable. 
Q: It was -- did you ever receive 
any training for what you were doing? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, there wasn™t any of that stuff. I guess 
there wasn™t really time for that. Besides that 
anything organized, you want
 to stay clear of. 

Q: So that was some thing conscious, you r
eally stayed away from the organized -- 
A: Absolutely. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Oh, absolutely, you don™t want
 to get involved with that. 
Q: Why?  

A: We ll, Germans have -- the Gestapo had a way 
of convincing people to 
talk, and if they got 
ahold of one fellow in an organized thing lik
e that, you know, they could kind of find out the 
name s of a bunch of other people. That™s the 
reason from one  group to the other, you didn™t 
know ma ny people you know, who -- cer
tainly didn™t know the name s.
 And there were usually 
one, ma ybe yo -- one fellow in your group would know
 one fellow in the other group. And that™s 
the way you do the communications. Then th -- 
later on, you know, what -- 
when -- after I got 
caught and sent and things got more organized, 
and I don™t know what -- how it was done in that 
time. But that was -- that was after the summer of ™44. 

Q: Okay. When you were to leave your home 
and you mi ght be going -- I™ll go back to the 
period where -- the two week peri
od where all the rescues were taking place, when you would 
leave your home , would you be aware th
at some one mi ght be following you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
38 
 
 
A: No. No, I never thought about that. 
Q: So you didn™t feel like pe
ople knew what you were doing? 
A: Very, very, very few did. I mean, there wasn
™t anybody around where I lived that knew, as far 
as I know. I never asked anybody af-after the war.  

Q: And did you ever have any encounters with the Danish police? 
A: We ll, yeah, I helped one policema n wanted to
 get to Sweden one time, Danish policeman, he 
had gotten in trouble, so I -- I he
lp him over. But that was about the only time  I was involved, 
was really involved in anything. 

Q: How did you regard them, though?  
I™ve heard that it was a sort of 
an open secret that they -- 
they knew that some  of this resistance was going on -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- and they didn™t try 
very hard to stop it. 
A: That™s right. That™s absolutely right. 
Q: Okay. 
A: As a ma tter of fact, 
on occasion they helped.  
Q: Okay. Anything thatyou were involved with? 
A: No, just what I™ve heard. 

Q: Right. 

A: But poli -- police no -- was not very friendly 
toward the -- toward the Germans. And after the 
war I met a fellow who was in the police at that 
time, and he was telling me  things that was 
going on that showed the police was -- a lot of tim
es was in -- in a sense against the Germans. 
Q: When you would take a family to the coas
t and get them to Sweden, did you -- was there 
anyone you had to report back to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
39 
 
 
A: No. 
Q: -- that they were rescued? 

A: No. 

Q: Okay. 

A: No. I think what they -- what
 they probably did when they got
 to Sweden, they were th -- I 
think there was some  ki nd of a -- an organiza
tion over there that t
ook care -- I me an, you know, 
you get over there with a couple of kids, you don™t know anybody, you have no mone y, so 

some body got to look after you. And there was some
 organizations over there, both Swedish 

Jews, and -- and Danish Jews who had 
escaped and -- and look after them. 
Q: Can you talk a little bit a
bout the money. These -- 
these rescues did take money, you had to 
take taxis, or trains, or pay the fisherme n. 
Where were you getting the money to ma ke this 

happen?  

A: I never paid a fisherma n, for one thing. Ther
e are stories that some fisherme n got paid 
because they risked their boat, but I never 
heard of anybody, seen anybody do it. The ambulance, 
of course, we didn™t pay them. Taxis, most of 
the time we didn™t pay them either, cause they 
were kind of part of the whol
e thing. Where you get money fr om -- you never use any. I didn™t 
use any. In those -- in those days I 
lived at home, and I got the salary
 for most of the time , even if 
I didn™t show up. He wa s very nice about it. So
 -- no, I -- I -- I don™t re
ally know who -- who did 
that.  

Q: So in the instances that you were involve d in, no money was paid to the fisherme n? 

A: That™s correct . 

Q: Did they ever say wh
y they were doing this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
40 
 
 
A: We ll, of course, a lot of thos
e fellows didn™t like the Germans ei
ther, so they were all -- that 
was one of the reasons for it. And then the other thi
ng is ba sically that this really wasn™t so much 
o-of Jews or not Jews, or whatever. They we
re -- it was ma ybe  because they were, you know, 
Danish citizens, they were just like the rest
 of us, you know, and all of a sudden the Germans -- 
if they had been going after the red haired, it woul
d have been the same  thing, probably. It just 
happened that the Germans went after Jews, sothen you help the Jews get off -- they wer -- 
escape.  

Q: I read that one prominent activ
ist, [indecipherable] Jacobsen said
 that -- that it really wasn™t 
about Jews, it was -- it was more about democr
acy, that the Danes were tired of the Germans 
being there -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- resented it. 

A: Yep. Oh yeah, no, it wasn™t because they were
 Jews. And then of course, as time  went on, 
there were other than Jews that -- that had to 
get to Sweden. After -- after that fall of ™43 -- 
Q: There were other Jews th
at had to get to Sweden? 
A: No, no, there were others, than Jews. I mea
n, there were -- there we
re like allied bombers 
who™d be shot down over Denmark, and then their 
crew had to be helped to get over to -- to 
Sweden. A classmate of mi ne, Billy Talbotsa was 
fl ying for the Royal Air Force, and he got shot 
down over Denmark, and he ma naged to get his wa
y to Elsinore and they put him on a kayak. 
Unfortunately, he -- he didn™t ma ke it across, he
 drowned. But ma ny others got over there. Also 
there were parachute agents that had to get 
back. Niels Bohr you know
, there was one guy that 
came over illegally to Sweden on a fishing boat 
and then wound up at the Manhattan Project. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
41 
 
 
How in the hell where is  Las Cruces New Me
xico. Poli -- certain Dani
sh politicians, wound up 
in England for BBC. So,  there were ma ny othe
rs than just Jews that were shipped. 
Q: We re there people that you knew, that you 
admi red i-in your country, who -- for their 
resistance also?  That inspired you, I guess. 
A: No, not really, because I didn™t know who wa s, you know, the big mucky-mucks. They had 

the Danish Fr eedom Council, but that was ve
ry secret, and I don™t 
think anybo -- anybody knew 
who was on -- at that thing. [indecipherable] Jac
obsen was one, they come  out after the war. 
There was -- there were a -- ther
e was -- I think there were a c
ouple of doctors on that, one or 
two politicians. But no, there was -- there wasn™t 
really much me ntioning of na me s. It was just 
too dangerous. Wouldn™t do any good. 

Q: Did you have a sense that there we re
 a lot of people i
nvolved, resisting? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: You just didn't know who they were. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: Okay. 

A: Yeah, there was -- I don™t think there was any doubt that there 
were a lot of people, lot of 
people involved ma ny di fferent ways. 

Q: Talk some about people who weren™t invo
lved and ma ybe e ven who were informing or 
collaborating. 

A: We  had that too. 

Q: Yeah. Tell us about that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
42 
 
 
A: That was one of the things that the resist
ance move me nt did was elimi nate some  of those 
people. There were a number of them got -- 
got -- got shot. One guy 
who reported me into 
Gestapo, that™s the reason I got caught, and he go
t eliminated. So that happened to a number -- 
Q: Do you reme mber who that was? 
A: No. No I never knew his name . 
Q: How did he know that you were -- 

A: I don™t know. I don™t know. I don™t know who he 
was, I never talked to him, but I heard 
afterwards that he was the one 
that had reported to Gestapo th
at we were -- we -- we were 
meeting in this particul ar  place with the -- with the parachut e agent. 

Q: [indecipherable] Did you know anybody who was i
nvolved in that, that -- in the elimination 

of -- of informants? 

A: No. 

Q: Did you carry a weapon? 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: What did you carry? 

A: Parabellum it was called. I don™t reme mber 
whether it was ma de -- I think it was Be lgium 
[indecipherable]  

Q: And whe r e did you carry it? 

A: Inside the jacket.  

Q: Where did you -- 

A: But not all the time, you know, only 
when you -- when you had -- on a job.  
Q: Was it hard to get bullets for it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
43 
 
 
A: We  didn't use very ma ny, so no, I don™t -- I don™
t recall that. You didn™t use it very much very 
seldom you had to -- I think that was only once or
 twice I had occasion to
 use it. You want to 
avoid that as much as possible.  
Q: What were the circumst
ances that you did use it? 
A: Oh, there was one time some  guy had got the 
idea that there was a -- a depot out some where 
that was just absolutely full of
 -- full of weapons, and there wa
sn™t many Germans taking care -- 
looking after -- guarding it. And there was like 
a small hill and up on top there was a fellow 
sitting with a machine gun. And then there were
 a couple of guys walking around inside of the 
fence. So the way it was set up, we had a friend 
of mi ne worked for -- for a brewery, so I had 
arranged for us to borrow a couple of trucks. So
 we drove out there this morning, and the wa -- 
one guy had a rifle, and he was supposed to shoot 
the guy on top. And I had to get the rifle out to 
him, which is kind of hard when you -- on a bicy
cle kind of hard to hide.. So I borrowe d a -- a 
rake and a spade, whatever it was, and then ti
ed it on the bike and put the gun the mi ddle of the 
burlap around it and took out the -- anyway, he was supposed to shoot the guy on top, and he 
mi ssed. The meanti me  we drive up alongside, we s
how -- throw the tarp over the barbed wire 
and jump inside. And -- but since he didn™t get 
the guy up on top -- he was 
sitting up there with a 
machine gun and he was doing a lot of shooting, so we got back over the f -- over the fence and 

ran away. It was just -- you -- you couldn™t. 
When you -- you have a re
volver, you don™t start 
fighting with machine guns, 
your odds are against you. 
Q: Oh, so you -- you shot it, but you also then decided you were outnumbered? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. So what were you going to do?  Take all the guns? 

A: Yeah, we could always use some  more.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
44 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: That was in -- must have been ™44, early ™
44, I think. Whe n did I get 
caught?  I got caught in ja 
-- June ™44, I think it was. Mu
st have been early ™44.  
Q: So wa -- did you have any successful raids on German de pots -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- where you did get guns? 

A: No.  

Q: Okay. 
A: Wa s a -- a lot of parachuting down of the alli
es. And then they also, they -- they started 
building some  over there, ma king some , you know,
 ma nufacturing some . They were primarily, 

they were -- they we
re parachuted down. 
Q: When wa s the other time that you used your g
un, or one of the other times?  You said there 
were a few occasions. 
A: There was -- there was this -- this girl out ther
e, she had been reporting 
in, and so we were out 
there, we were trying to eliminate her, but
 there were too ma ny -- too ma ny Gestapo people 
showed up, so we had to forget about that one
. There was a little shooting going on, but not very 
much.  

Q: Shoot and go? 

A: Shooting. 

Q: Oh, little shooting, uh-huh. So you 
were going to -- to kill her. 
A: Mm. 

Q: Did she ever get killed? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
45 
 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: Yeah, she got taken care of. I don™t reme mb
er  her name  either. I probably didn™t know her 
right name  a nyway, so -- 

Q: So she was part of your group, but she had -- 

A: No, no, she was -- she was telling the German
s about not our group, but 
some other people -- 
Q: Other people. 

A: -- she had been reporting on [i ndecipherable] and then some  mi
ght ha ve been arrested and it 

was her fault.  

Q: But some thing like that, the eliminati
on of some one, is that some thing you took upon 
yourself, or was that -- did that 
come  as an order from someone? 
A: That came from upstairs. 

Q: And wha t ™s that -- 

A: I mean, well -- 
Q: How would you hear?  What is upstairs? 
A: The Freedom Council. 

Q: Oh, that came from the Freedom Council? 

A: Or close to that. Or close to that. 

Q: Okay. 
A: Close to that. There wa s also the -- the fr
eedom no the -- the parachute people. They had a 
number one ma n there Flemmi ng Muse. And he -- I 
think he had authority to do that. Then the -- 

the communists had a rather
 large group called BOPA -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- and known as the Borgelige Pa rtisaner.
 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
46 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And they had [indecipherable] 
part of that [indecipherable] 
Q: Okay, mm-hm. 
A: And they -- they had, you know, could decide thi
ngs like that, that™s 
how prized they are. 
Q: And would you or some one you knew, how 
would you get the me ssage that you were 

supposed to go assassinate, for 
example, this -- this girl? 
A: We ll, I -- I don™t know how it came down, I only 
know that these people I was with at that 
time, his name was [indecipherable] I think it wa
s, and he had gotten word. How he got it, who 
he got it from, I don™t know. 

Q: Okay. At this point are you begi
nning also to do some  sabotage? 

A: No, I n -- I never did any blowing up and such
. I was a guard at some  of -- yo-you always had 
people standing around, watching and I was involv
ed with that, but I 
didn™t handle the 
explosives, or -- didn™t like the smell of 
it, for one thing. They smell like marzipan. 
Q: It smelled like? 

A: Marzipan. 

Q: Marzipan? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. What else are you doing 
to resist at this point?   
A: We ll, we were -- actually, when I got caught
 we had just gotten a new shipme nt of -- of 
bombs parachuted down, they were not very big, 
but th -- the purpose was to put them under the 
German trucks because they were short of rubber, 
and they had a hard time getting tires. So if 
you could blow their tires to pi
eces, you know, they couldn™t drive 
their trucks around. So all you 
had to do is put these things undern
eath the -- the tire, then when 
the -- th-the car drove off, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
47 
 
 
would blow the tire up. You will be 40 miles from
 there in the meanti me. So we™d just  gotten 
these -- a shipme nt down of that, and I was wit
h, I think there were four, ma ybe five. One was a 
parachute agent, and he was showing us how to 
operate, how to use them and all that. But then 
the -- the door busted open and in came  the Gestapo with a mach
ine gun, and all that stuff, and 
you™re told to hit the -- the fl
oor. He ate the special agent™s pill, and he died right there 
[indecipherable] 
Q: In what amount of time?  

A: A mi nute?  It was almost inst
antaneous. A mi nute, two mi nute. So
 we never got to use those, 
but they were used pri -- a littl
e afterwards, those tire bombers. They™re only about this big. 
Q: The -- the parachut e ma n who committed suicide, wa-was he Danish? 

A: That™s correct . 

Q: Did you have a pill? 

A: No. 
Q: Why -- why did he do that? 
A: Oh, I think he probably had heard what the Germ
ans were inclined to do to parachute people. 
They were pretty hard on them. So he  is buried in Copenhagen. 
Q: What was his name? 

A: Robert Johansson I think it was.
 Robert Johansson. Nice guy. Yeah. 
Q: How mu ch had you worked with him?  

A: Oh, I don™t reme mber . It wasn™t that long, he
 hadn™t been there that
 long, I don™t think. I 
hadn™t known him that long, at least. 

Q: Did you know he was going to do that if you were caught? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
48 
 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: We ll, you know, you know that they had this pill. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I suppose it was up to each individual wh
ether he want to -- to take it or  not. 
Q: What were the Germ
ans like with you, then? 
A: We ll, we were the -- I forgot whether three 
or four -- anyway, we we
re taken to the place 
where they did their interrogation, 
place called the Shell house, used 
to belong to the ol d oil -- to 
the oil comp any. And then they started the -- 

Q: Oh, the Shell Oil Company? 

A: Shell Oil Company, yeah. Germ
ans had taken -- Gestapo had ta
ken that house over, and used 
for their headquarters, and they did a lot of th
eir interrogation in that one. So, we spent some  
time in there, and I can do without that that 
wasn™t very nice. There was a fellow from the 
southern part of Denmark, spoke both Danish
 and German, a nd he would kind of switch you 
back and forth. So after that was over, I was -- 
I was sent out to the 
-- the jail in Copenhagen. 
And had my  own cell there, and th
en they would -- a couple of 
days I was pulled out and sent 
back in to the Shell H
ouse for a little more -- 
Q: What did they do during the interrogation? 

A: Oh, they kind of hit you with
 a -- I don™t -- rubber thi
ng, about that -- like a nightstick, but all 
rubber, hit you over your kidneys, which is all 
uncomfortable. And then, you know, hit you other 
places, and kick you a little. Right to the jaw, left
 to the jaw, whatever 
they feel like. They™re 
they™re - just not very nice.  

Q: And how long did that go on? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
49 
 
 
A: We ll, i -- you really don™t keep check on th
etime . I mean, you just 
hope it™s gonna be over 
with. But I forgot th -- what -- 
in there four or five times, so
mething like that. And otherwise you 
sit out yourself, by yourself. So -- and that went 
on for -- I guess I was in that jail for a month. 
And then they came there one morning, I don™t know, 
three o™clock, told me  to get dressed -- get 
my gear. We went out, got in a 
bus -- a-a -- this truck, then they
 took us down. And they took us 
down to just over the border, place 
called Flensburg and there were 13 of us, and that -- put us in 
the jail there for -- oh, I don™t know, 
two or three days. And then th
ey took us by bus to Ha mburg 
to the jail and we were just there one day. A
nd then they took us down to the concentration 
camp. And then it was strange because norma lly 
when you come  down there, you get, you know, 
your prison number at that time
 was some where in the 50 - 60 thousands. Ours was 500, and that 
was because the 13 numbers were what they 
called politsi haftling. That means you a r e under 
arrest , but your sentence has not been determined yet. So, we were politsi haftling until 
some where around Christma s, and then we became  ju
st a -- a normal, regular
 prisoner. But in the 
meanti me, that helped me because one time my  name was on a list, I was told, I forgot, but 

anyway, I found out that I was suppo
sed to be transferred to one of the work camps, which they 
were building these trenches so 
the allied tanks couldn™t get in. 
So you walk around in this water 
up to your knees or whatever. You never get 
dry clothes on, and it™s 
cold, it was in the 
wintertime. So the fellows there usually didn™t la
st very long. So I heard I™d been transferred 
there once, I didn™t like that, so 
I got permission to go up to the 
camp office, and I said to the 
clerk up there that I was politsi haftling, which m
eans I had to be -- available again -- in -- in 
case Gestapo wanted me  back and maybe he bette
r not ship me  off cause he could wind up and 
get in trouble. So he agreed, so he took me  of
f the list, then some  other poor bugger got on the 
list there. Then I really got tr
ansferred. But the reason for that 
was that one of the 13 had found 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
50 
 
 
out afterwards  said we had been sentenced 
to be hanged, and some how or other the -- the 
instruction got lost, and that™s the reason why we
 got into the camp, we got
 this strange number. 
The sentence had actually had been pronounced. 
Q: What was the name of the camp?  

A: Neuengamme. 

Q: Did you know that camp existe
d before you were sent to it? 
A: No, no. We didn™t know -- really know anythi
ng about concentration camps then. There had 
been some  talk that there were camps like that
 some where around, and that
 was for anti-socials. 
They had various ma rks, they had purple, they
 had red, they had green triangles on your -- on 
your uniform. They had one camp [i ndecipherable] 
Denmark for political prisoners, that wasn™t 
too bad, actually, I understand. But the ones down 
in Germany that -- that didn™t get much 
publicity that  time. After the war, I think that ™s when a lot was written about it. 

Q: And your camp was in your country, or were you -- 
A: Germany . 
Q: It was in Germany.  

A: Just outside of Ha mb urg. 

Q: And -- but before we really move  on to the -- 
to the camps , just wondering if you could talk a 
little bit about why you think the 
people in your country really sort of came  up and i n this 
spontaneous, organized fashion helped rescue so
 ma ny peopl e?  What do you think gave them the 
desire, the will to do that? 

A: You me a n to help people get to Sweden? 

Q: Yes, particularly that. That tw
o week period but just the ongoing --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
51 
 
 
A: We ll, you know, De nmark had been independen
t since, I don™t know, a thousand years. Never 
been occupied. And then, naturally when so
me body come s in like that, it™s going to cause 
resentme nt and everything else. 
So it gets to the point anything you can do that can be anti-
German, whether it was help people 
get to Sweden, whether it was blow
 a railroad car in the air, 
whether it was put a bomb on a ship so it woul
d sink, whether it was publis
h papers, whatever it 
was. Anything that was kind of anti-German, pe ople 
will be in favor of. 
99 percent, I think, of 
the people. 

Q: And the people who didn™t, I me an, how did you feel about them? 

A: We ll, because there always gonna be some  wh
o just sit back and watch life go by, and then 

there™s a certain percentage that w
ill be in favor of the -- of the Ge
rmans. A part of that could be 
people who lived in a part of Denmark that 
had been German f-from 1864 to 1920. And y-yeah, 
that was [indecipherable] you coul
d understand kind of, in a way, that
 -- that there were -- there 
were certain reasons. But a lot of 
the other one no, there was no excuse for them, and they really 
got taken care of after th
e war, I mean, they were -- lot of them went up in jail for simply being 
too nice to the Germans. 
Q: You haven™t really me ntioned the king 
much. Is he some one who inspired you? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: And can you talk about that? 

A: He was a pretty good guy. He used to ride ar
ound every day, and his son was A-one too. They 

were -- you have to have some thing to hang on to
. And politicians are not the real ones. Look at 
politicians in France, Laval, Pétain, I mean they
 -- Laval got hanged, I th
ink, Pétain wa sn™t -- or 
almost 100  so he got away. But I me an, there 
was nothing there we had to look up to Belgium, 
the -- the king gave up there, Leopold, he wasn™t
 considered much of anything. But in Holland 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
52 
 
 
and Norway, king and queen took off for England 
and for med exile -- exile governme nts. They 
didn™t have any in Denmark, exile governme nt in -- 
in the -- in the -- the 
allied countries, which 
was a bit of a handicap in the beginning. But 
the -- the king proved to be pretty good anti-
German, although his wife was German. Bu
t I think he was -- he was very good. 
Q: How could you tell he was anti-Germa n? 
A: It was known from al ready before the war that
 he wasn™t much in favor of them. I  mean, he 
got a -- he turned 70 -- yeah, 
he turned 70 in -- in 1940, a
nd he got a very elaborate 
congratul ation telegr am from Hitler, and he answer
ed, thanks. Hitler got all teed off. That™s not 
how you thank the -- the fuehrer, just by one wo
rd. So it -- it wa s pretty well known that he 
wasn™t muc h in favor of -- of the Germans.  
Q: Did you yourself ever see him riding his horse? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Can you describe that? 
A: Wa s just -- he wore an officer unifor m, and 
he just rode. Was a red light, he stopped, wait 
until it turned green. He was very good. And his 
son the crown prince was trained in the navy, 
which of course ma de him much better as far 
as I was concerned. But he was pretty good guy, 
too.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: In this period in 1943 - 1944, what would you 
say is the most difficult thing you had to do? 
A: The one specific thing was after I went to Sweden in the fall of ™44 -- no, fall of ™43, I didn™t 
see my parents until after the war was over, ex
cept once. I wa s in a st reetcar and I saw my 
mother standing, waiting for anothe
r one. And it was difficult not to get off and say hi. At that 
time I hadn™t seen her for about a year, and it w
ould be another year before I saw her again. 
Q: Why wouldn™t you get off and say hi? 

A: Cause she didn™t know where I was, supposedl
y. She didn™t know I was back in Denmark, she 
thought I was in Sweden. 

Q: Tell us about that, you -- you went to Sweden
, why and what did you do there, and then how 
did you come back? 
A: I went to Sweden in -- after 
the -- after we had helped the Jews
 get over at the tail end of, of 
that one which was in the f-fall of ™43. And then 
when I was over there I was working in a -- in a 
lumber ca mp for awhile, and then I -- I sent a le
tter to the British embassy in -- in Stockholm. I 
volunteered for service in -- in the Br itish forces, 
and I got a letter back asking me  to come  up for 
this script, so I flew u -- I -- 
I took the train up thereand -- and me t the peopl
e in the -- in the 
embassy, and -- and the problem wa s that it woul
d take, oh, I forgot, six 
months before there 
would be room. They only had, that time , I thi
nk room for one or so every night, the flying a 
Mosquito bomber back and forth. So I figured he 
-- by the time the war™ s over, it™ll be too late to 
do anything, so I went -- I went b
ack to Denmark, and went back at
 the re -- the resist ance stuff. 
And then I went -- twice more, I 
went over illegally to Sweden fo
r whatever reason there was -- 
some body had to get over there, and some  had to -- had hotel some  -- wha t ever. So I we nt over 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
54 
 
 
there twice more and came  back. So I was over -- 
all told, I was over there three time s, back and 
forth. 
Q: So I -- that actually -- want
 to ask you a couple things. Just 
go back to that mo me nt where you 
can™t talk to your mother, does she see you? 

A: No. No, s he didn™t. That must have been
 in the spring of ™44, yeah, spring of ™44.  
Q: Does she have any idea wh
ere you are at that point? 

A: She thought I was in Sweden. 

Q: So, were you wearing a disguise? 

A: No. No, but it was -- you know, you
™re in the street car, there™
s a lot of people and seeing one 
face out of ma ny, she just didn't catch a glimpse of
 me . And I  didn™t want  to call her, cause I 
didn™t want to cause any -- cau-cause her to get ne
rvous or anything like that. If she figured I was 
in Sweden, she would figure I was, you know, safe 
and all that. So that™s when I got caught; she 
found out shortly after. Obviously 
she got kind of upset, so did my 
father. But then their -- when 
I -- when the war was over -- well okay, anyway, that™s -- 

Q: When you come back and you™re not s -- well,
 let me  ask it this way. When you come  back 
and you see your mother on the streetcar, 
where are you living at that point?   
A: I was living at a house Lupine (Lupinvej) number 
nine that belonged to a Jewish fa mily that 
had taken off for Swede n. After I got caught, th
at was myself in the house and a young student, 
and when I got caught, the next day the Germans 
went out and blew the house up. Unfortunately, 
they didn't tell the student, and he was sleepi
ng upstairs. And in his bed he went through the 
window, out on the front lawn, still in his bed, wi
thout a scratch. That™s rather unusual. Anyway, 
the house was completely knee high. I™m -- I -- I sa
w the people after the war, and they rebuild, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
55 
 
 
and of course governme nt paid for everything, so 
there wasn™t any financia
l loss as far as they 
were concerned. 
Q: We re you specifically sought after by th
e Germans?  Did they know who you we re?   
A: We ll, when I got caught, and I 
got out to sh -- to Shell house
 and the fellow said my name  -- 
by that time it was too late to try 
to hide it. So I said what do 
you want, so he said oh, Steen, we 
been looking for you. Well, they ma y say that to 
everybody, just to try to scare you a little bit, 
but anyway, it di -- it does kind of make you a lit
tle nervous. Whether they really did or not, I 
don™t know. 

Q: To their mi nd what -- what -- what were
 you up to?  I mean wh -- why were you a danger? 
A: We ll, you -- you c -- you got to admit to someth
ing. You can™t just say 
that you -- you haven™t 
done anything. So you admit to as little as you 
think you can get by with. And then hope that 
they™re -- they™re gonna buy it. Furt
hermore, they had -- they were 
-- they -- they -- they arrested 
a lot of people at that time, so they were 
pretty busy, these fella -- these policeman that 
interrogated you. And they couldn™
t spend that much time on you, so
 unless they got some thing 
out of you fairly soon in the game , they just 
usually shipped you down s
outh and leave you there. 
Q: So what did you admit to? 

A: Some bu -- some  with the -- with the papers, 
and there was one other thing, now what the hell 
was that?  There was one other thi
ng, and I got by with that. It wa
s some thing in connection with 
the -- with this -- this parac
hute guy, cause they kind of tied 
it in. And he was dead, so he 
couldn™t say anything. 

Q: A-And you were caught with bombs? 

A: Yeah, we had bombs in the -- in the apartment. 

Q: Had you ever been invol
ved in the bombing before? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
56 
 
 
A: Oh yeah, with those little ones.  
Q: Can you just describe a situa
tion where you bombed something? 
A: We ll, this was with the tires. You -- you put
 them under the -- the German trucks and then 
when they -- when they drive over them they 
blow up and the tire™s 
completely ruined. You 
know, it™s not as exciting as blowing up a factor
y, anything like that, but they had problem 

getting enough tires for the tr
ucks, so it was helpful.  
Q: Maybe you could take us through it. Wou -- w
ould it be at night?  Did you have the bombs in 
a bag?  Where would you go?  How would you get them under the tires without being seen?  

How™d you do it? 

A: We ll, you -- you try to do it when it™s dark. You™d go on -- on the -- on the -- you would go a 

bicycle if you have the proper lights. And you coul
d go until, I forgot what
 it was, 11 o™clock in 
the evening there. So you c
ould drive around, then if you saw one some where, you could just 
stop and stick one underneath and then peddle along. 
Q: So there was a kind of
 random quality to it -- 
A: Yeah, that™s right.  
Q: -- you mi ght just ride around a
nd see what you could fin -- fi nd. 
A: That™s correct. When you found one you went after.  

Q: And did you go back and check later on to see if they had exploded? 

A: No. That wouldn™t have done any good anywa
y, except if -- you would probably put another 
one underneath them, but no, we didn™t. 

Q: And how ma ny tires do you think you were able to sabotage? 

A: Oh gee, I don™t have any idea. 

Q: Like five, or 50? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
57 
 
 
A: I don™t -- I -- well, you know, with
 -- with those things, first of 
all, you never know when they 
go off. You can put it underneath
 and it -- it may mi sfire. Or it may -- you may be lucky and get 
four tires, the ones -- if you have
 those double -- double tires on 
the truck, so no, I wouldn™t have 
any idea. 
Q: What other kinds of assignments were you 
getting?  We re you being asked to go to Sweden 
and bring things back?  Or people back? 

A: One time  I went over with -- with some  plan
s on -- for some  fortifications on the -- on the 
west coast of Denmark. I went to the -- as I re
ca ll it, deliver ed them to the police commissioner 
in Helsingborg a fellow name  of Palm, and he 
-- he arranged for them to be shipped on.  
Q: Who were they being ultimately sent to? 
A: British embassy in -- in Stockholm. De
legation I think it was. British Delegation. 
Q: And whe n you did go over to Sweden, how 
would you do it?  How would you arrange getting 
over  t h er e? 
A: We ll, go in one of the boats. We  always 
knew some body who was going, so -- so just go with 
them over. 
Q: But was it suspicious for just a person to be 
on a fishing boat in the 
mi ddle of the evening? 
A: Well, the fi shermen were ther e. 

Q: Mm-hm. Was -- 

A: So I came -- oh, one time  I ca me  and I went up
 in a small town called Lanscona. And I didn™t 
have any place to stay that nigh
t so I called the Palm up in Hels
ingborg and he said -- he called 
me  back shortly after, he said, well, the drunk ta
nk is open tonight if you want it. So I went in 
there and slept in a padded cell th
at night only time  I ever been in
 one of those. But they were 
very -- the Swedes were very good about everyt
hing, very helpful and did what they could.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
58 
 
 
Q: And did you ever take any items, other than 
the -- the maps, the plan
s for the fortification, 
over to Sweden? 
A: No. No, just o -- what had to go. You didn™t ha
ve that muc h room, so you just took what you 
had to take, had to bring over. 

Q: And you -- did you ever bring guns back? 

A: No. No, the only thing I brought was that ne
wspaper, British newspaper, which I shouldn™t 
have done. I only did that once. 

Q: In your daily life, what were your interact
ions like with the Germans, once you were o -- 
active in resisting them, what was it like to run 
into them on the street and maybe talk to them? 
What wa -- what was that like? 

A: You wouldn™t talk to them, fo
r one thing. And the other thing, they were -- they were running 
around on the -- you know, they were walking 
around on the street, and -- and you don™t do 
anything special. I mean, you don™t want to stand 
out in any way. Some -- some fellows tried to 
just stop them and -- and take their guns, you 
know, steal their gun, things like that, but that 
didn™t always work so well. They got caught, and 
then they were in trouble. And there was too 
much of a risk just for a gun. Wa sn™t worth it. 

Q: But on a daily basis, did you feel that you 
mi ght get stopped and searched and caught?  Wa s 
that a fear you lived with every day? 

A: Well, yeah. You al -- al y -- 
you always worry about it, of c
ourse. Also, because there were 
these people who would -- they w
ould report people who were in 
the resi st ance to the Germans. 
So you never know whether some body like repor
ted you in, and you know, you were likely to 
get picked up. That was one -- 
one thing you -- you kind of lived 
with. And that was about the 
hardest one of them all, because it™
s kind of a 24 hour a day pr oposition.

Q: Can you reme mber a close call that you had, wh
ere you were very close to being discovered 
by the Nazis, besides the newspaper? 
A: Not offha nd. 

Q: Okay. 
A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: Was there any sense among the 
people that you did speak to, w
ho were like yourself, in the 
resist ance, what was the ultima te 
plan there?  What was the goal? 
A: Oh take -- have the Germans lose. I mean, everybody was hoping for that, and after the -- 

after the inva -- I was still out 
when the invasion happened, and afte
r that  started --  that  -- that 
came about, you know, then there didn™t seem to be much doubt who was going to win. And 
after the invasion -- the German police 
got more difficult, was more active. 
Q: More what? 
A: There was more active. 
Q: More active, mm-hm. 
A: Particularly Gestapo fello
ws. So anyway, I mean, everybo
dy -- everybody I think wa -- was 
convinced that the al
lied was going to win. 
Q: Can you take us back then, to that night th
at you were caught?  We  -- we -- we™ve me ntioned 
it before, but let™s just go back to th
ere. You were with this parachut e -- 
A: Agent. 

Q: Agent. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And you were going to use these bombs on the tires. And just -- 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418

Q: -- what happened, the -- the ca -- the police came
 in, the Gestapo came  in and what did they 
say to you?  
A: Hit the floor. So you™re down there, you™re
 -- you don™t argue when they come  in, you know, 
with a bunch of guns like that po
inting at you, you just go ahead, a
nd cooperate, do what they tell 
you to do. So you get down on the floor and then
 pretty soon you -- you get the handcuffs. And 
then the -- this was on the fifth floor, I think, in 
that apartment. Take you down, put you in a -- in 
a truck and take you to that 
Shell house for interrogation. 

Q: And did they take the agent w
ith you, even though he had died? 
A: I don™t know what happened to him. He was s til
l lying on the floor when -- when I left. He is 
buried in the national ce
metery over there now.  
Q: So there were a period of time and there were
 five interrogations, and 
this went over how long 
a period of time ?  

A: Oh, couple, three weeks. Couple 
of weeks, probably. Maybe three. 
Q: And are you see -- seeing anybody else at
 that time your -- that your fellow -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- fellow [indecipherable] 

A: Only that fellow that came with food. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Then after couple of weeks, another fellow ca
me  in, another prisoner come  in, so we shared 
the cell for the last  -- I think I was there probably four weeks in that  jail, so the last two weeks 

there were two of us. I forgot -- I think he went
 -- he went to -- he we
nt to Neuengamme too. He 
was a baker.  

Q: Had you known hi m before? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
61 
 
 
A: No. 
Q: Hm. Had you prepared in any way to be captured?  Mentally? 
A: No. I mean, you al -- you al
ways hope you™re not gonna you™re
 not going to get caught, but 
no I don™t think you sit down and say, well if 
I™m gonna get caught, I™m gonna do so and so, 
think so and so, you don™t do that. I th
ink it™s simply too scary a thought. 
Q: So then what -- 

A: And you se -- oh, oh, excuse me , but during that
 period, all the time th
e -- the Germans would 
shoot -- execute people, there wa
s one innkeeper, he got caught because he and his family had 
been receiving some  weapons parachuted down. And 
so he got shot, and I think he had two sons 
and a son-in-law, all -- all of them got shot at  the same  time. One of the kids was only 16 or 17. 

But they were all executed. And the Germans would regularly execute people from the 

resist ance, and they announced it in the 
-- in the paper, so it was no secret.  
Q: Why do you think you we
ren™t ex -- executed? 
A: That is some thing that I will never know. Theyhad to yo -- I mean, we were supposed to -- to 

get hanged, I was supposed to -- to -- supposedly 
sentenced to that, and this -- that happened on 
the way. Wh y they did that I don™
t know it -- it -- 
I know one -- one of the 13 after the war me t a 
guy, a German policema n -- shortly 
after the war, you know, and this fellow said to him, are you 
still alive?  This chap said, what do you mean 
by that?  He said, We ll, we heard you were gone 
down Neuengamme he sent me ssage that you were -- supposed to hang you down there. And I 

never -- nothing ever -- and they used to hang pe
ople regularly down there.
 One time they -- they 
hanged eight Polish girls at 
one slot -- one time .  
Q: Danish police girls? 

A: No, Pol-Polish. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
62 
 
 
Q: Oh, Polish girls, mm-hm.  
A: Polish girls. Yeah. Well, the fellow who wa
s the head of the camp got hanged himself 
eventually, after the war.  

Q: Talk a bit about the camp when you got ther
e. What -- what happened when you first arrived 
there? 

A: The first thing that you do is they take a
ll your clothes. Then they shave you, anyplace they 
can find, and -- and then you get some
 clothes that doesn™t fit you ve
ry well. I wound up with a -- 
with a winter coat that was -- that wa -- must 
have been like from Poland because it was very 
thick material and there was like cotton in th
e mi ddle. And it was nice and warm, but during 
these long nights when we had these appelles, 
you stand out there for parade, and you were 
standing out there for four, five or six hours 
until -- they had to count everybody, there were 
20,000 roughly, in the camp. And y -- 
if they only counted 19,999, we
 just stood there until they 
found the last one. So at least th
e coat were nice and warm for th
at. So after they -- they put -- 
give you some  clothes, then you™re sent over to 
some  barrack some where, and then you had to 
find a place. There were usually oh, three guys to a bunk. 

Q: You say you had to find a place that -- so, you so
rt of walked in and you weren™t assigned a 
place -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- you had to see if you could sn
eak in some where [indecipherable] 
A: You know, you see if the -- well, one -- if
 there was one only, two people in -- 
Q: Okay. 

A: -- you know. One time I found one 
with only one fellow in, so I cl
imbed in that one bed, then 
I found out why he was alone 
and I got out very quickly. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
63 
 
 
Q: Why was  he alone? 
A: Homosexual. So I was out, no time flat. Then 
we worked -- I think they woke us up at six. 
Oh, there™s been a lot written a
bout that, you know, in -- people w
ith better me mory than mi ne.  
Q: We re there other people from th
e Danish resistance at that camp? 
A: The whole police force wound up th
ere for awhile. All the Dane -- 
Q: [indecipherable] the whole police force? 
A: Yeah, all the Danish policemen. They were ther
e for awhile, then they got shipped to another 
camp. My godparent™s son was down there in the 
same  place. I didn™t even know he was -- been 
picked up, but I me t him down there one time. So 
there were some other 
Danes, but the Danes 
were all in -- in a number of different 
camps, they were not all in Neuengamme.  
Q: When you found someone you kne
w, did you try to stick with them, or bunk with them, or -- 
A: No, but you were assigned to a barrack and you 
couldn™t start running from one to the other. 
Be -- try to meet the m when you can, you 
know. You had Sunday afternoon off, I think. 
Q: Off fro m what? 
A: Work. 

Q: What was your work? 

A: In the beginning we were keeping some  -- they
 had some  -- some  -- two big buildings built o-
of brick, and that™s -- was meant originally as ba
rracks for the -- th-the gu
ards. Then later on they 
moved the guards outside and then these were used
 for prisoners. But the baseme nt was used for 
-- in -- in case of air raids. Not to prot ect the pr
isoners, but to ma ke sure that in case a bomb hit 
some place the prisoners couldn™t run away. So our
 assignment for awhile was to keep them 
clean. Then for -- I was switched over one time  to 
ma ke some  kind of machinery for volk -- for -

- they had a -- a gun down there that the -- 
the home  guard was using, supposedly more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
64 
 
 
dangerous to be the guy f-firing 
it than the fellow who was in fr ont of it, cause they bl ew up all 
the time . And we were ma king some kind of a pa
rt to that Volksgewehr thing. And then -- oh 
then I got jaundice, and -- and dysen
tery and went in -- in hospita
l and then the war was over.  
Q: What -- can you talk a little bi
t about the other people who were 
there? You said it wasn™t just 
Danes, who else was there? 
A: There were Belgium, Holland, Polish, Russian. 
I got pretty friendly wi
th a guy from Urkutsk, 
that™s way out in Siberia some where. I said 
Polish, and then there was some  Czechs, and no 
Italians, no Norwegians that I 
know of, they were in another camp. But t here were all told, 
roughly 20,000 there, and about on 
average 2,000 died every month. 
Q: How did you know? 

A: We ll, you -- you hear this from the camp offi ce,
 you know. I mean, there was a -- a f -- couple 
o-of prisoners work in the camp office, and they we
re the one that wo -- w -- ha -- have access to 
information such as that . 
Q: Were there Jews in the camp? 
A: I don™t know it specifically Je
ws, no. I don™t think so. Ours w-were mostly political prisoners 
which was the red triangle. The green triangle wa
s -- I think yellow was --  was -- was criminal, 
and there was some  religious prisoners down there, because everybody had a sign on them. I had 

-- like I had a red D, for 
Danish political, and 67399.  
Q: That was your numbe r? 

A: That was my number, yeah, after 
I got out of that politsi haftling. 
Q: [indecipherable]  

A: 67399, yeah. 

Q: And how were the barracks 
or gani zed? Who was in charge? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
65 
 
 
A: Some  of the prisoners that had been there 
the longest was what they call camp, kind of ca mp 
police kapo -- k-a-p-o, kapos. The kapo we had was a Polish guy. He™d been there -- God, he™d 
been there a long time, and he was supposed to kind 
of keep -- keep order in this barracks and 
ma ke sure everything worked out okay. He had a 
lot of author ity fr om the -- fr om the Gestapo 
people. 

Q: We ll, what kind of person was he? 

A: He wasn™t as bad as the Gest apo, but he was not a very friendl
y sort. It wasn™t very easy for 
him either pr obably because each -- I imagine each
 barrack ha d at least a thousand prisoners. So 
he had to keep all that in orde
r, and you know, had -- that™s kind of
 a tall order, cause a l-lot of 
them are pretty rough characters. 

Q: When they did execute people, was it done
 publicly, and were you made to watch? 
A: It was usually done Sunday -- see, Sunday we only worked half a day. So there we had the 

appelle, the counting in the morning and then on 
Sunday at 12 o™clock. Re gular days it would be 
in the morning and then again at six, at -- at a 
-- when work finished. But on Saturdays after the 
appelle was worked out they would hang them befo
re we were excused from so we go back to 
our camp. Although the -- the Polish
 girls, they we re hanged in 
the -- in the camp, they had a 
little jail there, and they took them in there and hanged them all. 

Q: And was that done in ma
nner that you could observe? 
A: No, you couldn™t see them. 

Q: Why wer e  they hanged, do you know? 

A: No.  

Q: Did you usually know why people were hanged? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
66 
 
 
A: We ll, one guy was hanged because he tried to hide
. He wa -- he was really a sa -- I think he  
was kind of half -- half crazy. He had had so muc h of
 this camp that he wanted to get away, so he 
hid in a chimney some where. And so we were st
anding there waiting for th
is last one to count. 
Finally they found hi m, and then next Sunday they
 hanged him. So that was him. That was the 
end of that one. 
Q: Did you ever consider trying to escape? 
A: No. No, by the  time  you have these dog ruled ba
rbed wire fencing and they were about what, 
12 feet high, and you have dogs running around 
in between, and you have people -- ma- machine 
guns all over. You had nightlights shining down 
these -- between the two. No, you don™t stand a 
chance. I don™t know of anybody who ever got out of Neuengamme anyway.  

Q: So once you got in and you saw that, how did you intend to survive? 

A: By surviving. I mean, there™s -- we were fort
unate in -- in a sense th
at after a few month we 
started getting food packages from - -  from the Da
nish Red Cross. And there was -- the beginning 
there was a -- th-there was soap -- soap in them
, there was food in them, there was all kinds of 
things. But in the beginning the Germans w
ould open up the box, open all the packages and 
dump everything in -- in a -- in a bowl, so
 you get your soapsuds, and your salami  and your 
coffee beans all in one nice me ss. But then after 
awhile then they would leave them alone and 
then they worked out fine. One of the big things
 was salami , they used to ship us -- God knows 
how much s a lami . You can get tired
 of that if you get too much. But that really is what -- what 
helped again. And then this -- one time they se
nt us some  clothes, you got a jacket, which was 
badly needed.  

Q: We re the other groups of people, the Poles, 
the other groups you me nt ioned, were they getting 
packages? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
67 
 
 
A: Not that I know of, ne ver saw anybody get any.  
Q: Do you know if the resistance was involved in 
helping the Red Cross get you this stuff, or 
was it just the Red Cross on its own? 
A: I don™t know. I wouldn™t be surp
rised if -- if the people in th
e resistance hadn™t been involved 
in some  of it, but I -- I don™t -- I don™t know one way or the other for sure. 

Q: Is that some thing where your 
parents could send you a package? 
A: No. 

Q: Did they know where you were? 

A: We were permitted to write a letter, was ever
y month or every six weeks, and we were told 
what we could say. You know, I™m only -- I™m
 fi ne, how are you, I hope
 you are fine, good-bye. 
Q: Did you write it? 

A: Oh yeah. Well, at least it was your handwriti
ng. So they knew you were still alive, that™s 
about all it amounted to. 
Q: Wa s there any one person or couple people th
at you became particularly close to at the ca -- 
in the camp? 
A: We ll, of course, out of the -- 
the 13 of us that went down at th
e same  time, we ma naged pretty 
much to stick together. The mi nister got shippe
d to another camp. The one fellow died, but the 
other one -- the two -- two got mo
ved to another section, but ther
e was about six or seven, and 
we -- we ma naged to stick pretty muc h together. 
Q: We re you in the same barracks? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oh, you were? 

A: And we -- we came back on the same bus. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
68 
 
 
Q: Who -- do you reme mber any of their name s? Or, which name s do you reme mber? 
A: We ll, the fellow that di
ed, his name  was Thompson.  
Q: That was the parachut e agent? 
A: No, no, that was one of the 13. 

Q: Oh, one of the 13. 
A: He was an innkeeper fro m
 just south of Elsinore. 
Q: He was executed? 

A: No, he died of TB. 

Q: Oh, he died of TB. 

A: I think he died of TB. 

Q: Okay, okay. 

A: The other ones -- the one called Christenson, he
™s the guy that had the stroke after the war. 
No, I don™t reme m -- reme mber their name s. 
Q: Did you know those me n -- they were all me n? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Did you know them before you went in? 

A: No. 

Q: You call them the 13, okay. But you were rounded up together? 

A: We  were -- 

Q: You were interrogated together? 

A: No, we were pulled out of jail toge
ther and shipped down south together. 

Q: Okay, you were pulled out 
of jail together, and -- 
A: I didn™t know them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
69 
 
 
Q: -- you became a unit when you were shipped down south -- 
A: Correct. 

Q: -- to the concentration camp. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. And when were you sent
 to the concentration camp? 
A: When?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: That mus t  have been in July of ™44, 
or August. Some time in the summer  of ™44.  
Q: But not -- just to get all 
this clear in my mi nd then, so 
you didn™t know each other be fore, but 
then you got to know each othe r as you were shipped down. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: We re you all Danish? 

A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Had you all been in the resistance? 
A: Right. 

Q: Okay. So, you don™t reme mber their name s, but 
if you could just talk 
a little bit about how 
you stuck together when you were in the camp, what small things would you do for each other, 

or what mi ght you talk about together? 

A: Well, like I say, the pr eferred subject was what
 are we going to do when we get out. There 

wasn™t really much to talk about what we had 
done -- not much to talk about what we™d done 
during the war. That was kind of a item you didn™t 
really talk much about
. There wasn™t really 
that much to talk about either what you had done
 before the war, it was really mostly what -- 
what you gonna do from now on, when the war™s over, when you get out. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
70 
 
 
Q: What kept you going when you were in the camp? 
A: I don™t know, I™m -- I kind of wondered too once 
in awhile because you see, some  people -- I 
n --6 there was one Danish fellow I knew, tall, 
strong, big, good looking, he didn't last a month. 
He just seemed like he -- he collapsed, he just
 kind of fell apart. And all the small, skinny 
fellows, you know, that would ca -- kind of hang ar
ound. So it has nothing to do with physique. 
Q: Mm. Did you pray?  Did you rely on your faith? 
A: Yeah, and that™s where we -- we had 
that mi nister, which was very helpful. 
Q: Tell us about that. 

A: One of the 13 was a mi nister.  

Q: Tell us about that.  

A: I can™t even think of his name  any more, 
but he was good, he was very, very good. Very nice 
chap. 

Q: What would he do? 
A: We ll, you know, he would ta -- he™d talk to
 you an-and cheer you up, 
and pray a little and 
things like that. Can™t think of 
his name , but he was there an-and th
at mu st have been like in -- in 
January of ™45. The Germans ca -- ca -- I think they 
collected all the mi nist
ers in one particular 
camp, and he was -- he was shipped down there.  
Q: When -- when did you get sick? 

A: Oh, it was on March or April of ™45. Course, 
jaundice is some thing that
 kind of come s fairly 
slowly. I mean, it™s not like 
all of a sudden boom. Dysentery ki
nd of come s pretty quick, and I 
was in so-called hospital for -- 
oh, I guess it was only three or four days before we were moved 
with the buses back to De nmark. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
71 
 
 
Q: So just give me  the chronology, do you -- you got
 sick and then were you taken out of the 
concentration camp to 
a separate hospital? 
A: No, it was just oo -- 
Q: You just were in the hosp
ital in the concentration camp? 
A: Just one of the barracks, yeah. 

Q: Okay. And how sick were you, I mean, we
re you -- could you get out of bed and walk? 
A: Yeah. But you know, yellow jaundice, you™re 
all -- your eyes are yellow, your face yellow 
and --  

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and then you -- when you have this dysentery on top of that, that ma kes it not so good. 

Q: So -- 

A: Besides, they didn™t have
 any me dicine for anything. 
Q: Right. At what point 
-- what happens then? 
A: We ll then, the head of the Swedish Red Cr
oss, a fellow name  -- na me  -- fe-fellow by the 
name  of Bernadotte had ma de a deal with Himml e r,
 that he would try to negotiate with the allied 
and get a peace going, and the price for that, Hitler 
had -- Himmler had to pay was to agree that 
all Danish and Norwegian concentrace -- con
centration camp inma tes should be shipped to 
Sweden until the end of the war. So that™s 
when several white buses came down to the camp. 
First they collected a bunch of
 prisoners from other camps in Neuengamme, Norwegian and the 
Danish. Then the buses came down, and then they 
took all the prisoners up to a camp just north 
of the Danish German border, fa -- a place call
ed Froslev So we come  up there and we were 
there for a couple of days and th
en they took us by bus and they
 -- and train, we were supposed 
to go through Copenhagen and over to Sweden. But 
I didn't want to go back to Sweden. So just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
72 
 
 
before the -- you get into Copenhagen there™s fairly 
long hill. And I was in th
e first car, so I went 
up in the platform and ended up -- said to the -- to th
e engineer, I want to get off. So he said well, 
he could slow down at that hill there, which he 
did, and then I jumped off the train. And then I 
was in -- in Denmark. 
Q: You jumped off the train, did -- does th
at me a n that you fell, and you had to roll? 
A: We ll yeah, jump. I didn™t fall, I jumped off. 

Q: You just jumped off a
nd you ended up standing up? 
A: No, oh no, no, you roll. You roll a lot. I mean, they™re moving fairly fast. 

Q: But you were sick. 
A: We ll, no sicker than I got on 
the train. Yeah, I had been -- 
they took us from the camp in 
Germany, took us across the border to Denmark, put
 us in this camp down there just over the 
border. We  were there for ma ybe a week, and th
en the -- we were gonna go to Sweden. And as 
we came wit h these buses o-over the border to De
nmark, the first place they took us to was a 
dairy. We  could have all the milk we wanted. 
And not having had any milk for about eight 
month, and I drank a lot you really get a tummy ach
e. It sure tasted good. So then I got off the 
train in Copenhagen, and s -- I went over to 
some body I knew down there and couple of days 
later I went and got the -- some  I.D.. And then 
I went up to El sinore and stayed for a few days 
with a -- with a couple. And then I heard one ni
ght the war wa s over. So I called my parents and 
then I spoke with them and bought a bicycle, dr
ove home. That was a nice trip. And that was 

May five, ™45. Interesting years.  

Q: How did things seem at home, when you 
got home ?  How was your mom and dad and your 
sister?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
73 
 
 
A: My father was at work and so was my sister, 
so I called them. My mother was there, she said, 
what can I do, you want a sandwich? Of course sure
 I did that. So I had so
me thing to eat. Then I 
-- I went out to the office I used to work, ju
st to say hello and I was back. And they said, 
whenever you™re ready, come  on bac k. So then 
I went back home  agai
n, my father got home. 
And then I was home  for a couple of days, and then
 they told me to go to the hospital because of 
the jaundice and that. So I was in
 the hospital for about a week 
I guess. And then I was on -- in 
the -- in the countryside for a w
eek, and then back to work. I think I was back to work within 
four weeks after I come back from Germ
any. The r e wasn™t any of the psychological 
straightening out assistance and ev
erything like that. So I went back. And then I worked for a 
couple of month, then I h
eard about that job in E
ngland, went over there.  
Q: How did you celebrate your home c omi
ng that night with your parents? 
A: We ll, I guess we just talked. They wanted 
to know how it had been, and I wanted to know 
what had happened there, you know. So I™m -- I™m sure we talked until rather
 late in the evening. 
But there wasn™t any celebration in that sense.
 There was just  -- I guess 
we were both pretty -- 
pretty pleased we were still alive.  
Q: Had the Germans left? 

A: Oh no, they were all over. They were all ove
r the pl ace. No, they didn™t leave, but you know 
they -- they -- the British and the --  and the Am
er ican came in, and the Germans had given up in 
all but one very small part of Denmark where th
ey want to fight, and eventually the Russians 
bumped them out of that Bornholm. But -- so the 
Germans start -- just started walking -- walking 
home. Nice to see them leave.  

Q: Did people just let them go, or were 
people angry and did they retaliate?

A: No, they -- they just let them go. A lot of 
the Germans would buy -- tried to buy food to take 
home . But the time they get down to the border they
 just had to leave ever
ything in one big pile. 
Q: Why?  
A: The -- the -- not to take them
 back to -- to Germany. For one 
thing, they were paying with -- 
with money that the German ar my had borrowed 
from the Danish government, which means that 
in a sense the Danish governme nt 
was paying for all this stuff. So 
they didn™t want to -- all that 
stuff to leave Denmark. 
Q: And how were people treating collabor
ators who -- who had survived the war? 
A: We ll, the standard operation 
for the wome n, you cut their hair o
ff. You have them standing on 
a -- on a truck and you drive thr
ough Copenhagen. For the -- for the me n, same  thing, cut the -- 
cut them bald and same  thing, and then they put
 them all in jail and you kind of straighten out 
within a few weeks, you know, who s hould stay in 
jail, and -- and who hadn™t been that bad, they 
could let them out. There were 
-- some of the worst fellows, 
some  of them who woul d be 
shooting Danes for instance there was some  of
 that going on, too. They wound up, and the com -
- some  of them got executed. They were shot. 
But I don™t think there were more than 40 and 50 
all told, like that. And then there were some th
at were put in jail. The German general and the 
head of the Gestapo in Denmark, people like that, th
ey were -- they were put 
in jail, they were in 
for six or seven years, then th
ey shipped them out, back to Germany. So t here was a big party 
that night. 

Q: Which night? 

A: That night the war was over. You know, you 
would have all the -- all your doors, your 
windows open, all the lights you wanted, you can -- you 
can put candles out in
 the street if you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418

want to do that. You could play all the music 
we  want, with the doors open. Could do all those 
things you couldn™t do during the war. 
Q: So people did that? 

A: Yep. As I recall, my mother had one can of 
Portuguese sardines she had left. We  a t e that 
night, celebration. Yeah, that was 
some  party. And then we were back to work, and then the -- 

the daily routine started again. 

Q: Some  wa y -- I™m not sure exactly when, I th
ink that you we re in Sweden and you ran into 
some body who recognized you, that you ha
d helped. A doctor and his wi fe? 
A: Oh, ah -- 

Q: Can you tell that story? 

A: Yeah, that was Dr. Erstwag, I think. 

Q: Okay. Just tell us that story. How did that happen? 

A: Yeah, I met hi m someti me over there. Oh, I 
knew he was over naturally, cause I™d helped him 
get over, but I didn't know where he was, and 
I met him on the street one day, I don™t even 
reme mber what town it was. But he wa -- it wa
s nice to see them, th-they both looked -- and the 
baby was doing well. Started walking 
and everyt hi ng else
. Little girl.  
Q: Wa s this the couple that had 
been inside the beer cases? 
A: No. 

Q: Okay. 

A: No, th-they went over with -- they 
went over with a fi
shing boat, I think. 
Q: So you didn™t recognize them nece
ssarily, but they recognized you? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And wha t  did they say to you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418  
76 
 
 
A: We ll, th-they told me  they appreciate what I 
-- helped them get over an
d all that, and told me 
how well they were doing and everything else. They
 were looking forward to getting back before 
long. Back to Denmark. Then he died shor
tly after, but I me t her years later. 
Q: How do you think your country dealt with the wa
r after the war?  Did people just push things 
aside, or were there wounds that really had 
to be healed some how?  You think it was some thing 
that really weighed on people? 
A: I think there was a -- a -- quite
 a lot of people who realized th
at the people who been resistant 
had -- had taken some  a wful lumps, physically, fina
ncially. What they did on 
the physical part of 
it was built some  old age home s specifically for pe
ople who had been involved with that. They 
have five of them, I think, in Denma r k now. On 
the financial part, they
 examined eventually 
everybody. That was -- I think it was 
five years before I ever wa-was checked out and -- to find 
out whether you have anything 
anything wrong, any -- any lowe
red ability of ma king your 
living, And things like that.. And if
 -- decided, I think they deci
ded I was 60 percent unable to 
work full speed. So then they give you a certa
in amount of money to ma ke up for that. We ll I 
been working right along, but of 
course if -- if I hadn™t been down there, things mi ght have 
worked out a little bit 
better, because you do have certain pr
oblems after that. I mean ow -- you 
don™t sleep as good as you -- you norma lly would. Ther
e are -- there are certain disadvantages. 
But I think they™ve been very liberal ove
r there in -- in what they™ve been doing. 
Q: Do you have trouble sleeping? 

A: Yeah. But nothing compar
ed to what I used to. 
Q: What was the problem wa -- before that was so bad? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418

A: All of a sudden you -- you are back there, in 
-- in some  of i t , and -- then you kind of wake up, 
you know, and you™re a little unhappy 
and takes awhile before you go back to bed -- go back to 
sleep. 
Q: Nightma res. You™re talking about nightma res. 

A: In a sense, yeah, that™s what it is. But ev
entually, I think, you get pr
etty much over that.  
Q: But you had them for  a long time ? 

A: Yeah. But it doesn™t bother me  any more now
, fortunately. So -- oh, I came  out pretty good, I 
mean. Physi cally, me ntally, everything else, I came
 out a lot better than a bunch of fellows did.  
Q: Is there some thing I haven™t 
asked that you would like to say? 
A: We ll, I think I gotta say the governme nt ha
s been very liberal, 
considerate and -- and 
everything else like that. 
Some  of the -- some  of t he natives ha
d a little different attitude, but -- 
little bit more shortsighted. He
 didn™t help me  any, so what good he done for me ?  But that™s a 

mi nority. I™ve been over there, oh, I 
don™t know, 20 times since then, a
nd it -- it™s nice to get over 
there, but it™s not like they used to be, I mea
n, like it was before the war. And I guess it™ll never 
be like that, at least w
on™t -- it won™
tfor me.  
Q: We ll, how is it different? 

A: Oh, because you can™t help, you walk around 
and you get to think, you know, this happened 
there, and that happened there, you k
now, those things [indecipherable]  
Q: Mm-hm. Yo-You can™t be there 
without the wa r, you™re saying? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: The war is always with you. 

A: Yeah. Yep.  

Q: Okay, and what is this here? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418

A: That™s my passport, issued in
 1942 and worth ti -- valid until 1947. 
Q: Don™t think, let™s just doubl
e check. And this one here? 
A: And this one here is from ™47 to ™52.  
Q: Okay, when is this one here? 

A: Ah, whe n was that?  From ™50 -- ™52 to ™58. 
1952 to ™50 -- ™58, yeah. And that was the last 
Danish passport I had. Then ™54, I became a U.S. citizen.
