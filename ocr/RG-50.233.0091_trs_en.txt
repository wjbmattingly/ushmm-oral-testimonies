Interview with Leon Merr ick 
April, 1992 
Rockville, Maryland 
 
A: My name  is Leon Merrick.  I was born in Zgierz
, Poland.  Spelled Z-g-i-e-r- z.  It™s  near Lodz, 
about four miles from Lodz.  I was born January
 8, 1926.  I had my mother and father who were 
living in the same  city as Zgierz.  I had a younge
r brother, his name  was Motl.  He was three 
younger.  I was attending school in Zgierz when
 the war broke out September 1, 1939.  I think I 
was 13 years old.  
 

Q: Can I ask -- let me  stop you for just a second and 
ask you a little bit about 
your early life; before 
the war?  And about -- can you tell me some  th
ings about the town?  Wa s it a large town?  
 

A: Okay.  Zgierz was a town, excuse me a mi nute you™re
 going to edit it later, ri
ght?   Is that what it 
is? 
 

Q: No, we won ™t edit it. 
 It™ll be just like this. 
 

A: All right. The town was,
 Zgierz, I think it was about, 129,000 
people, was about 5,000 Jews.  
Was mostly textile, the people 
were engaged in textile. 
 

Q: Wa s that area of Poland a big text ile area? 

 

A: Ye s, because Lodz was the biggest textile 
area in Poland.  Zgierz was only about eleven 
kilome ters away. This is roughly about five, six miles. 
 
Q: When did you start going to school? 
 

A: I think I star
ted school in 1932. 
 

Q: So you would have been, how ol
d?   Se ven or eight years old? 
 

A: I think seven years old. This 
is when primary school started. 
 

Q: Wa s it a public or a private school? 

 

A: It was a public school. 

 

Q: Did you also go to like a Hebr
ew school or a Jewi sh school? 

 

A: Ye s, I was going to a Jewish school in the af
ternoons because the public
 school was up to, let™s 
say about one, two o™clock. After this about 
once a week, or twice a week we had to go to 
Hebrew and learn about Hebrew.  
We  also had one hour of religious
 school in the public school. 
 

Q: Oh, so you had one hour of religio
us training in the public school? 
 

A: In public school, right. 

 

Q: What exactly, do you reme mber the things 
that you studied in 
the Jewish school?? 

 
A: Basic religion, you know, it was 
a basic course, about the ho
liday and things like that. 
 

Q: Wa s it very fa r from the public school or---? 

 

A: No, it was in the same class. 

 

Q: Oh, it was in the same class? 

 

A: It was in the same  school. We  just had I th
ink, all Jewish pupils, boys and girls.  But we had a 
sprinkling of gentiles, they excused themselves.  So
 the same  thing, it was a Catholic class. The 
Catholics had one hour of public school t
oo.  So they excused the Jewish kids. 
 

Q: Do you remember any instances of an
ti-Semitism when you were growing up? 
 

A: Well, like I just mentioned, most of t he teachers 
were Jewish. A few of them were Poles. The 
head of the school, he was a Pole. As a ma tter of 
fact, he had the same  last name  like I have and 
he was a Pole.  I just reme mber one Catholic
 boy was going to our school
, to our class because 
he was persecuted in the old gentile school because his father was a communist and things like 

this.  So he couldn™t attend school 
over there, he came to our school. 
 

Q: Do you remember like any instances of kids
 getting beat up because they were Jewish? 
 

A: Sure, all the time.As a matter 
of fact, it happened to me  too. On
 my street, there were not many 
Jews living so when I came  home from school 
or from any other place, I saw a couple of 
roughnecks in the street, I know they going to be 
after me , I was waiting for a grown up person 
who was going to pass by my house or ma ybe to the same  apartment building so I can go with 

him.  I woul d be protected, more or less. 
 

Q:  Thi s  happened oft e n or---? 

 

A: Ye s, quite often. 

 

Q: Do you remember which street you lived on, 
the name  of the street when you were young? 
 

A: Ye s.  It™s a long name , I could spell it. Thename  of the street is 
name d after a city nearby 
because it led like--Rockville Pike to Rockville. 
The name  of the city was Konstatynowska, K-
o-n-s-t-a-t-y- n-o-w-s- k-a, no. 15. 
 I t was a wooden frame house.
 There were four families 
living in the same house. We were living lik
e on the courtyard. The European houses have 
courtyards., I mean apartment buildings have courtyards. 
 

Q: Te ll me , what did your father do for a living? 

 

A: My father worked, he was---he worked in a 
factory.  Like I me nti
oned, there was a textile 
center.  He was--sometimes he was going on a truc
k. They had a truck and they also had horses 
and carts. They were going to 
the nearby city of Lodz and they
 were picking out raw ma terials 
from the factories that came out from the machin
es.  He worked in a finishing factory. They 
brought it back to the factory and 
they dyed the ma terial and they took out all this floss and they 
prepared it for the stores -- to 
be ready to go to the stores a
nd to work.  Here you go in, you buy 

a ready-ma de suit.  But in Europe ,especially
 50 years ago, you went to a store first and you 
bought the ma terial. Then you had to look for a tail
or.  So when they finished the material, the 
ma terial went to the stores. The people went inand said I need ma terial for a suit.  Man rolled 
it open, says, how much do you need?  
 He brought the measurements to the tailor. The tailor 
told him how much he™s going to need.  He took the 
scissors, he cut it off, he took it to the tailor 
and he ma de  the suit. 
 

Q: That™s  what your fath
er did, getting the fini
shing of the textiles? 
 

A: Ye s.  He bought the ma terial.  He didn™t finish 
it by hims elf.  He just co
llected all the materials 
from the nearby city. 
 

Q: Did he have a buyer or some thing? 

 

A: No, it wasn™t  a buyer because he wasn™t  buying 
it.  He was collecting it for the factory like you 
buy a salesman.  He brings in th
e ma terial to be finished up. 
 

Q: Your mother, she was a housewife? 

 

A: My mother was a housewife.  In the younger years,
 she worked but like we were getting older, 
we were growing up, she took additional work. She was working with wool in a factory too, 

spinning wool for the material.  
It wa s a textile center, every
body was working in the factory. 
 

Q: We re there any -- like Jewi
sh or any youth organizations? 
 

A: Ye s,ma ny. 
 
Q: We re you involved in any of them?  

 

A: Yeah, I was still young. At that age, I really 
didn™t  know exactly what organizations means.  I 
was 13 years old when the war broke out but I bel
onged to a couple of organizations, just to get 
together to meet people. 
 

Q: What did you do in these organizations? 

 

A: We  sing Hebrew songs, talki
ng about Palestine at 
that time.  Everybody was dreaming of going 
to Palestine one day because Jews were always at 
the me rcy of the Poles.They always felt like 
second -class citizens.  In this country we refe
r like ‚we™.  In Poland you refer ‚they™. You felt 
like an outsider, like you were not part of the pr
ocess and things like that
.  So it™s diff erent.  
They had a quota, they had a quota in school, they
 had a quota in the military. A Jew couldn™t 
be a high official in the governme nt.  Maybe 
from the Jewish distri
ct, he was elected, a 
representative, but that™s about--he couldn™t be
 a high official, appoint
ed.  He couldn™t--they 
didn™t take any Jews. 
 

Q: Why don™t you tell me  a little b
it about when the war broke out? 
 

A: Okay, I remember exactly when the war broke out, September 1, 1939.  I reme mber it was a 
Friday.  I think my mother went
 to the market.  Friday was ma
rket day, especially with the 
Jewish people.They went to buy the stuff for th
e Sabbath. There wasn™t  
like a grocery store.  

You went to open ma rket and you came  back in the morning.  It was eight, nine o™clock; the 
weather was crisp; everybody was talking about 
the war.  I looked up the sky and I saw these 
planes with the top that time because the war hysteria was going already a week or two weeks 

before mobi lization, talk about the Ge rmans and 
things like this.  On Friday, nothing happened 
to our city. The planes fl ew over in the morni
ng. They were just like birds up in the sky, the 
sun was shining.  Saturday, the planes came back
 again and the Poles were shooting up. You 
could see the tracer bull
ets, you don™t  know if you h
it them or not. The pl
anes flew right over, 
flew higher, nothing reached them.  But Sunday, th
ey flew very low. They came very low over 
the city and you could even see th
e pilot inside, very, very low.
The city was in a panic.  
Everybody was going towardsWa rsaw. The Poles a
ppealed to the populations, to able- bodied 
me n, to go towardWa rsaw. We ™re going ma ke a defense line over there, a stand.  My father left 

too. I reme mber we ma rched all night, 54 left Zgie
rz, we left for the city. We  went to a nearby 
village.   I don™t reme mber how ma ny miles, 
maybe ten miles, 15 was a village.  Everybody was 
just like -- refugees. We  took a few possessions,
 a little bit of bread. At night, we got very 
scared because the Poles opened al
l the prisons and they let out al
l the inma tes.  I don™t know if 
they were political inma tes or criminal inma
tes but you see a lot of people, they look like 
hoodlums with shaved heads. That night, my
 fat her left.  He went towardWa rsaw. 
 

Q: So all of you left togeth
er to go to the next town? 
 

A: To the next village. We  went there overnight.
  But the next morning, my
 father left -- he was 
just -- towardWa rsaw -- I don™t know.  Because 
the Poles --. At that time, everythi ng was 
disorganized already.  It didn™t 
take long for the Poles to get diso
rganized already. It didn™t take 
long for the Poles to get disorg
anized. They didn™t send you a 
summons, you have to report.  
They just broadcast, by word of mo uth that al
l able bodied me n who ha d served in the Polish 
army at one time or another had to report towa
rdsWa rsaw. They name d the city Lovitz or 
some thing, we™re going to ma ke there a defense.  
Me and my brother and my mother were left 
alone. We  figured well, we cannot
 defend ourselves. We  have no cl
othes, nothing; we just left 
in a hurry. We  went back towards Zgierz, our 
city.  On the way, we encountered the Polish 
army comi ng back, disorganized, disheveled w
ith horses with wagons, some  on foot.  I didn™t 
see any mechanized unit, none whatsoever. We  c a me  back to our home and the neighbors said 

they were glad to see us back, even though they 
were Poles. They gave us milk and bread and 
things like that.  I wasn™t  there ma ybe one hour
 or two, I heard shooting.  My neighbor who was 
a ma n, he didn™t run away because he owned a fa
rm nearby.  He said the Germans are comi ng.  
He probably got wind of it before. We  were into 
like a shelter.  I don™t know if it was a shelter 

or ma ybe an empty cellar, I don™t know.We  were
 there for a few hours, we heard shooting, then 
we came out  and the Germans were here.The 
next morning, we went
 outside and we saw 
strange uniforms, not like the Polish army. We
 saw a lot of looting, knocking off the stores, 
everything was in disarray. We  see whole co
lumns of Ger mans going towardsWa r s aw. They 
were passing our town becauseWa rsaw was north of where we were living 
 

Q: We re there any --?   Let™s see, you said that 
this would have happened the fi rst time you saw the 
Germans, likeTuesday orWednesday? 
 

A: I don™t have any perception of time but it was January the 8
th
, I mean September the 1
st
, the war 
broke out.  I think this wa s about January 6
th
.  Now I™m reading the stor ies where the Germans 
came into Lodz and I see January 6.  Being we we
re just about four kilome ters four or five 

away from Lodz, this wa s about six days or
 so.  It didn™t take long to come  up north. 
 

Q: Were there any -- when the Germans came did th
ey --?  You said, you talked about the looting, 
the looting of the stores and things 
like that?  Did they
 also loot houses? 
 
A: I don™t reme mber.  I don™t  see any houses, mo
stly I see, I™m s aying about Germans looting 
houses. The populations looting houses. 
 

Q: The Poles also? 

 

A: I have to correct myself. 
The Poles were looting houses. 
 

Q: So the Germans weren™t doing it? 

 

A: I didn™t see any Germans looting houses. They
 were looting houses and stores, we™re talking 
about. 
 

Q: Did the Germans i mpos e any restrictions on Jews ? 

 

A: We ll, okay, I™m going to get to th
is right now.  I™m at this part. 
 

Q: I™m sorry, okay. 

 

A: So after a day or so, after occupation, my fath
er came back.  He didn™t go toWarsaw, he didn™t 
go toWarsaw. 
 

Q: He never ma de it up there? 

 
A: He never ma de it up there.  He decided to co
me  back.  He decided to come  back so after a 
couple of days he was home , he decided to go back to the factory where he was.  He went back 
to the factory. The factory was not in operati
on. They put a German commissar in the factory 
because it was a Jewish enterprise, was owned 
by Jews but only Poles were working except my 

father and my grandfather. They were the onl
y two people working in 
the factory.  He was 
there ma ybe for a week or so. 
 

Q: They were allowed to work as they were before? 

 

A: No, well, the factory wasn™t  
in production, don™t forget. They 
were just sorting things out.  
Nobody came to work. They were just straighten
ing materials out and th
ings like this.  No 
payroll, nothi ng.  He just wanted to hold on to it
 because there was nothing
 else to do.  He went 
back to the factory.  I don™t 
think he even got paid for it. They had a German commi ssar and 

the German commissar moved; he was a local 
German, he moved into the quarters where the 
for mer people who worked in the office used to liv
e. They kicked them out. After a week or 
so, they dismissed hi m because he was a Jew.  He wasn™t  allowed to work. Then one day, I 

don™t have a perception of time, ma ybe it was thr
ee weeks or four weeks,
 according to the book 
that I read now, it didn™t take long, ma ybe mostly fi
ve, six weeks, they said all the Jews have to 
report to the ma rket square. 
 

Q: This is the same  ma rket where your mom used to shop? 

 

A: Yeah.  So we all reported to the ma rket square
 and we were all Jews.  I reme mber we debating 

to take my younger brother with us or not.  I do
n™t think we took him, we left him with our 
neighbors, they were Poles. We  went to the ma
rket square and ma ybe we stood there for three, 
four hours. Anyway, some body ca me  out and 
ma de an announcement, talking about the 
Germans if I  say some body. They gave us three 
days to leave the city. A lot of people were 
living up north towardsWarsaw, a lot of people -- 
we left for Lodz to live, for L-o-d-z because 
my mother had a sist er that was there. 
 

Q: So it was just you and your mother and your father? 

 

A: Andmybrother. 

 

Q: Your brother wa
s comi ng too?   
 

A: Yeah, we left him with the Poles when we went
 to the ma rket square but then they let us go.  
They gave us three days to leave the city.  So 
we assembled everything and 
we left to Lodz. At 
that time, we know already they™re 
going to have a ghetto in Lodz. 
This was in September.  It 
wasn™t  before. The Germans ca me  i n in September and ma ybe we left in October, November, I 

don™t reme mber. Wa sn™t  even snow on the ground yet because we rented a horse and buggy.  It 

was only about 10, 11 kilome ters away. We  piled up our few possessions, we took our 

furniture, we  took it into our neighbors, to the gentiles because we figure if the war is going to 

be over -- everybody was talking about England and 
France going to join the war, the war ™s not 
going to last long. 
 

Q: Is that the perception that most people had? 

 

A: That™s  right.  Maybe three, f
our weeks, five weeks the most.  
The British, the war ™s going to be 
over. We  ca n go back and claim our furnitu
re and our possessions.We  took it in for 
safekeeping. We  knew t here™s going to be a ghe
tto. We  moved in with my aunt, with a few 
possessions. We  were there ma ybe a week or
 two weeks but my father was working with 

some body -- he was in the office. When I me ntione
d it that there were tw
o Jews working in the 
factory, I was talking about two Jews like working people.  But in the offi ce, there were a fe w 

more Jewish people working over there.  One of 
the Jews, he was really from Lodz, he worked 
at Zgierz and he was commuting because he cam
e with the tramway every morning. We  find 
out that he has a lot of-- he knew 
a lot of people, he™s  
got a lot of pull.  My father went to him 
and asked him if he can help us out; we need some
 quarters where to live.  He sure did. We  got 
that room be cause apartments were very scarce. 
They put in the Jews from the city of Lodz 
itself, from all the environs. They put them in a small section and it wa
s the worst section, the 
most dilapi dated section in the city. They assign
ed us a Jewish quarter. We  had one room, just 
one room.  I t  served as a kitc
hen and everything, just one room 
for four people. Then -- that 
was in -- yeah, also for the refugees who ca me  fr
om the environs, they opened public kitchens.  

This was all in the fall of 1939.  I even reme mb
er the next Passover which was the next spring 
likeApril now, was still the public ki tchens, we eat in the public kitche ns because we were 

refugees. Then they close the ghetto.  May 1
st
 they close the Lodz ghetto. 
 

Q: In1940? 

 

A: In1940. 

 

Q: Let me  ask you, can we go back a little bit?   
Wh en you left for Lodz, I know that in the mi ddle 

of Septembe r, the Soviets and the Germans 
split Poland. You were on the German side? 
 
A: I was on the German side. 

 

Q: Wa s there any -- did you know people w
ho tried to run to the Russian side? 
 

A: Ye s,yes. 

 

Q: Did your parents ever think about trying to do that? 

 

A: My parents were thinking like that.  My fa
ther had a younger brother.  He was a shoema ker by 
trade and he was much younger.  He was unma rried 
and he went to the Russian side. We  also 
heard tales that people came  back fr om the Ru
ssian side.  My wife, she was living on the 
Russian side. We  heard that people have no pla
ce to live and they slep
t in synagogues and there 
were hungers going around. A lot got caught by the 
Germans. A lot of people did come back 
but I guess my parents didn™t have
 the guts, we didn™t have the 
nerve and we didn™t have the 
money. You had to bribe a lot, it cost money fo
r transportation to go even there too. We  didn™t 
go but my uncle did go. 
 

Q: Because he was unattached? 

 

A: He was unattached, he wa s single. We  never 
heard from hi m, we never heard from aga i n.  I 
never know what happened, if he vanished, if he
 survived the war or not.  Now, being as you 
brought my me mory back, my father had a younger br
other. Also he had another brother, he 
went towardsWa rsaw. When they said all able-
bodied me n had to come  and he got killed near 
Wa rsaw.  He did join a unit in the fighting a
nd we  never heard from hi m again.  Somebody seen 
him and he says he got killed.  His widow was living in the ghetto. 
 

Q: What was his name , do you reme mbe r? 

 

A: I think Schomi k, Schomolos, something like that . 

 

Q: Your father ™s younger brother? 

 

A: Yeah, but he was ma rried. 

 

Q: Let me  ask you, you talked about the ghetto an
d you said that it was closed in May 1, 1940? 

 

A: May 1, 1940. 

 

Q: You said it was in a dilapidated 
area of the city.  Can you tell me , 
describe it a little bit, how big 
it was?  Wa s  it surrounded by a wall? 
 

A: Okay. They closed the ghetto.  My father
 got a job because we had to live.  I mean nobody 
gave anything for nothing.  Like I me ntioned, this 
guy, he worked before, he helped us with the 
apartment, he also became  head 
of one of the hospitals. They ha
d three hospitals --  fi rst of all 
when they closed the ghetto, they had 160,000 Jews
. That™s  a lot of people. The ghetto was 
composed of two sections.  In
 other words, through the ma in
 street, the tramway was going.  
The tramwa y was going through the ghetto and they 
had a bridge. The Jews had to cross the 

bridge. 
 
Q: Ye s, I™ve seen a pictur e of the ghetto. 

 

A: If I want to go from one  side of the ghetto to
 the other side, I  couldn™t go directly, I couldn™t 
cross the road. They also had a few gates 
where the horse and buggy 
traffic went through.  
Pedestrians could go through too. The Germans guard
s there and they open the gate like five 
mi nutes or so.  Let™s say 25 people assembled, 
50 people  and there were no more traffic 

comi ng to the main street because there was barbed wire on both sides;  they let the people 

through.  I™m going to give you, I have the book and 
a picture.  I™m going to give you a clear 
picture of what this thing looked like.  I had to 
go on the other side.  My 
father got a job in the 
hospital. 
 

Q: Which was on the other side? 

 

A: It was on one side, it was on the ma in side.  My
 aunt was living on the other side.  Some  of us 
was commuting, I had friends. At that time in 1940, it wasn™t  so bad. They still got-- you still 

couldn™t go out. They were sentri
es posted shoot to kill; there 
was barbed wire around day and 
night and nobody could get in.  On
e section of the ghetto, the cemet
ery was adjoining it. There 
was a lot of black ma rket going on and you still c
ould buy food but then time s were getting bad.  
Then the Germans requested people for a sett
leme nt; it was getting crowded. They brought 
more people in from the surroundi
ng vicinities from s maller town
s. They were liquidating the 
ghetto and then they were comi ng into the Lodz
 ghetto. As soon as the ghetto got crowded, 
now I™m reading the books, I know how it was. At
 that time they were opening the camp in 
Kaldum, Humhof, the extermination camp. They
 had to feed the camp, the factories.  
Ostensibly, they were taking -- they were taki
ng some  people out for work too, on road crews, 
healthy me n.  But they were also
 taking out people who were si
ck. They sent to diffe r ent 
camps. 
 

Q: You were talking about passing fr
om one part of the ghetto to th
e other.  Did you need a pass to 
do that or just ---? 
 

A: No, no. The y had a bridge, we didn™t need a -- 
we  just claime d a bridge
.  I didn™t go outside the 
ghetto, we just crossed the bridge
.  If I didn™t want to cross to 
the bridge, I could wait near the 
gate.  Like I me ntioned, when no traffic, af
ter 25, 30 people assembled and people assembled 
other side; there are two guards.The German gu
ards now, they open the gates and you were let 
through, pedestrian traffic basically.  But I thi
nk they only had about tw
o or three bridges for 
crossing, I™m going to show you the picture la
ter on.  I gave a ma p of the ghetto too. 
 

Q: Youdo? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Wa s it Œ can you tell me  like approxima tely what 
size the ghetto was?   Like
 ma ybe four or five 
square blocks or some thing like that? 
 

A: No, it was more that  that , more than that. 

 

Q: Morethanthat? 

 
A: It was -- if you want to stop this, I can go ge
t the book, ma ybe they have a scale there.  Could 
you stop there for a mi nute, I™ll be right back.  
Wa s in Lynoska N-l-y and Dolna, D-o-l-n-a.  
This is the relationship, this is the city of L
odz.  See here. This is how the ghetto was in 
relationshi p to the city.  Here was the Jewish ce
me tery, see it?   Now, here is the tramway was 
going up. It says Zgierz, it was name d. This is th
e Zgierz where I was born.  Here was barbed 
wire, just a tramway which is comi ng through.  
Here is a picture -- I™m going to show you a 
picture what the bridge looked like.  Here it is, 
it™s a wooden bridge.  Here the tram is comi ng, 
we went on the bridge to one side to the other. 
 

Q: That™s just so that the Jews, according to 
the Germans, wouldn™t associate with theAryan 
groups?   Is that 
what it was? 
 

A: That™s  right, right, right.  
This was a wooden bridge. They had three bridges like that in 
different sections. They had the tramway wher
e we went by. When the tramway ca me through, 

the windows were closed. They know with the d
oors and the windows were locked.  I mean the 
Germans locked them in.  It didn™t take long to go through the ghetto, ma ybe in one or two 

mi nutes.  It was very small, they just whizzed
 by.  Now I™ m going to show you the Gypsy camp 
too.  I have a book.  I reme mber this.  I reme
mbe r  this guy, a German. A Gypsy camp red, 
ma ybe the________no, it was very -- dyi
ng like fish and Rita says
 English were dying. Wa s 
very few ŒTa ke a look, this is excrement they 
were carrying.  Fifty y
ears ago in Poland the 

worst section of town. They had no toilet
s or flushing water or things like that. 
 

Q: All Jews were ma de to wear the yellow star too 

 

A: Right, right.  Here was the el
dest of the Jews, this guy. We ll, you read the books, the Jews were 
Œ 160,000 Jews and some of them got___________ and 
then they brought in some  Jews from 
Germany, fromAustria, from Luxe mbourg. That™s
 what the guy looks like.  He was visiting the 
Wa rsaw ghetto.  I guess they went from one place 
to another.  Here™s  what they do with the 
settlements. Are you familiar with 
all this pictures, aren™t  you?  
 

Q: I™ve seen some  of the m, yes. Th
ese are the gates of
 the ghetto here? 
 

A: That™s right. That™s the gate
, that™s the gate. Assembled here
 and then they let you through.  In 
some places, they had a br idge. When they had a 
bridge, there™s no gate.  
There were not ma ny.  
Here the sign says that Jews™ living 
quarters, no entry, 
thing like that. 
 

Q: Wa s it relatively -- did people go out
 of the ghetto illegally so me times? 
 

A: Ye s, they did. 

 

Q: People trying to get f
ood and things like that? 
 

A: Yeah, people got killed too there, shot too. Y
eah, I reme mber, sure they got -- but not ma ny.  
The Lodz ghetto wasn™t  like theWa rsaw ghetto.  It was not smuggling going on. Wa rsaw was a 

bigger city and a lot of Jews, not a lot, some  Je
ws  were living on theAryan side but not in the 
Lodz ghetto because the population was so small. 
There™s no way you™re going to run. There 

was nobody on the other side waiting for you, to r
eceive you or  to guide  you or to take you 
some  place and hide you. You couldn™t go no place. 

 
Q: I™ve interviewed other people who said that they
 were more frightened of the Poles than they 
were of the Germans be cause they said --. 
 

A: Yeah, the Poles because you have no chance. 

 

Q: They said that the Germans only knew from 
propaganda who was a Jew. Whereas the Poles 
had lived with them and knew exactly who they were.  So they were more frightened. 
 

A: Even the bread lines before they closed th
e ghetto.  Like if you find out like a Polish baker 
bread, we went in line, the Poles spotted a Jew,
 they pointed out to the Germans and throw him 
out. They said yes, there™ll going to one Jew less
 in the line, they™re going to get an extra loaf 
of bread. This is why all the concentration cam
ps -- I should correct myse
lf -- the extermination 
camps were in Polish and the Slav
ic soil like in the Ukraine, in
 Russia and Poland.  Because the 
local population was hostile and th
ey couldn™t do it. They co
uldn™t do this in France and 
Belgium or Holland because enough of the population 
would help us, or at least there would be 
an outcry about it a
nd things like that 
 

Q: Let™s see. They closed the ghetto in May of ™40. 

 

A: Nineteen forty, right.  May the 1
st
. 
 

Q: What was your father doing?
 You said he was working? 
 

A: He was working in the hospital. 

 
Q: He worked in the hospital? 
 

A: He worked in the hospital. 

 

Q: Did you work or were you not working? 

 

A: Yeah, I was working too. 

 

Q: What did you do? 

 

A: Well, I tell you, it™s 
like that.  Everybody had to work.  I was young like I said when the war 
broke out, I was thirteen. When I we nt into th
e ghetto, I was fourteen, ma ybe fourteen and a 
half. What can a young boy like me  do?  There 
was no schooling ,nothing.  But I noticed that 
they had a lot in the ghetto.  Like I said, the gh
etto was self- admi nistered. They had more or 
less autonomy.  From t he beginning, the Germans di
dn™t mi x in, they just outside. They figured 
why should a German mix in if the Jews themselv
es can do the job for them?   I seen a lot of 
boys. They were like mailmen. The y were -- no
t mail men -- like they we
re carrying mail from 
one department to another. 
 

Q: Like couriers or some thing?  

 

A: Yeah, they were highly organi
zed in the ghetto. They had the 
statistical offices and they had 
ma rriage bureaus. They had archives, they had 
three, four hospitals, they had orphanages.  

Now, I™ m talking from the beginning, I™m talking 
about 1940.  I told my fa ther if he can find out 
if I can get a job like this.  He knew some body and 
we wrote a letter like 
a petition.  He gave it 
to some body and then I got a response.  I got a re
sponse for an interview.  I came to the office 
and there was a young girl over there and she asked me  
if I ha ve the strong feet.  I says yes so I 
got the job. The job was good.  I don™t reme mber if 
I got paid or not but I reme mber that I got 
two soups a day. At that time, you only worked
 for the food, you didn™t work for pay.  I mi ght 
have got some  money too, I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: So you were one of the se couriers? 

 

A: Yeah, I was one of the couriers.  I wa s attached
 to the post office, the ma in office.  From the 
beginning, then I mentioned, from the beginning 
before the hostilities between Germa ny and 
Russia, I™m talking 1940, a lot of Jews in the ghe
tto were still receivi ng packages from relatives 
from the Russian si de. At that time, everythi
ng was nice and dandy. We  had a post office, we 
had packages, everything was functioning norma lly, 
like this. The Ger mans, at that time, in 
1940, beginning of ™41, they didn™t quite decide to 
exterminate the Jews yet. They put them in 
ghettos, they concentrate them in centers but I 
think theWa nns ee started a 
little bit later on, in 
1942.  So that time we still received packages and mail and Jews came fr om Prague, from 

Germany. They had relatives; ther e were mi
xed ma rriages and mi xed partners ma ybe who 
didn™t come  to the ghetto and they sent packag
es.  It was like a pos
t office, everything was 
functioning norma lly, it wasn™t  quite bad. You still 
could get a lot of stuff on the black market, 
like food and things like that. 
 

Q: We re people, at this point early on, were th
ey apprehensive, were they scared that --?   
Obviously the people who left the ghetto or were probably shot, they were frightened by that, 

did people realize what it was poi
nting toward?  That ma ybe they
 mi ght be exterminated?  You 
know what I mean? 
 

A: We ll, I tell you, I™m going to give this now.  
I don™t reme mbe r  exactly when but it was quite 
early, ma ybe 1942, we heard a rumor that the Lodz
 ghetto was sealed.  Some  ne wspapers were 
getting through. You could hear some  undergro
unds, ma ybe  German ne wspapers, some  were 
getting through.  Because don™t forget ma ybe they throwing through the ga te, houses adjoining, 

just like the wall in Berl in.  One side was we
st, one side was east.  Some how news filtered 
through.  Don™t ask me  why, I was young, I was four
teen, fifteen years old but I heard early on, 
ma ybe 1942, there™s such a thing that the German
s said they™re going in the shower and instead 

of water, gas come s in. We  heard th
at but nobody believed but we heard it down. 
 

Q: Is there anything else that you reme
mber that was striking about the ghetto? 
 

A: From the beginning when some body died, they ha
d a regular hearse. They didn™t have a motor 
hearse like here but they had horses but then 
the situation got bad.  
People were dying from 
hunger and there were too ma ny of them; they just had flatbeds with horses. There were too 

ma ny, they just piled them up.  Like I said, I wa
s like a courier,  I was 
in touch with the post 
office and everythi ng come s in the ma il.  Especial
ly they have people, the people, you suffered 
more than the local, the people who got settle
d into ghetto like from Ger many, from Prague, 
fromVi enna. The Jews from the wes t , they didn™
t come  from a ghetto, they came  straight from 
their homes. They took just a few belongings, they came to the ghetto, they put them into a 

hostile environment. They had nothing in comm
on with the eastern Jews, with the locals and 
was wintertime. There was no heating, no fuels, when you came to the houses, you knock on 

the door, like you had some thing, a summons for them
 to report for a settlement or something, 
you had to go they were all laying in the beds
 -- were hunger -- they were dying with hunger, 
very bad. Then we heard about the Gypsies,
 they were building a Gypsy camp, I re member 
very well. 
 
Q: About what time was that when the Gypsies came , do you r e me mber? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber the exact date but ma ybe it wa
s in the book here.  But I have no perception of 
time, don™t forget, it™s been fifty years.  ButI reme mber exactly where the place was and they 

didn™t last long.  I could see, in other word
s, they get_________. The ghetto wasn™t  getting 
much food from the Germans outside.  But the Gypsies were getting the food from the ghetto. 

Can you ima gine how the situation wa s?  There 
was the Germans -- the German crimi nal police 
was in the ghetto. They had a building in the gh
etto. They dealt mostly with the Jews were 
informed by other Jews where was hidden wealth
 and things like that.  So metimes it was true 

and some times it was untrue.They saw them the
n, they thought maybe -- 
valuables outside the 
ghetto, they had to show them where it was, ma
ybe in the ghetto. They killed them, they 
tortur ed them, they couldn™t get anything out of them because the ma n didn™t have it. 
 

Q: What was your mother and your younger brother doing? 

 

A: Well, my mother, like later 
on everybody had to work so sh
e was working in a kitchen, a 
communal kitchen, peeling potatoe
s and things like this.  My
 younger brother, he was three 
years younger that I was so if I was fourteen, fift
een, he was only twelve a
nd a half, thirteen.  I 
think he worked in a me tal factory.  I don™t 
know exactly what he was doing but everybody had 
to be employed. 
 
Q: They were employed mo stly like you sa
id, it was easier to get food that way? 
 

A: Ye s, because you get food on your job, that™s  it. 
 Because the rations were not enough.  Like I 
had two soups a day and ma ybe he got a soup 
a day.  Everybody got a me ager ration, had a 
ration card but everybody got a bowl of soup by the place of work. 
 

Q: You talked about ration cards. To 
what did the ration 
cards entitle you to? 

 

A: Ve ry, very little. 

 

Q: A piece of bread or some thing?  

 

A: A piece of bread, ma ybe two kilograms of potatoes.
 That some ti me s have to last you for a week 
and some times have to.  Some times  they have to 
last you for three, four weeks. You could see 
that the food came in the ma in gate. They ha
d like an enclave. They had Germans working, 
Jews working,_____________ and all the food came into
 this enclave, they processed it 
through. They came in with horses and buggies with
 Polish drivers. Then the Jewish drivers 
took over. They took it into the ghetto. They
 unload the ma terial and they brought the wagon 
with the horses back. While they were going from
 the enclave out to the distribution corners to 
take it, they had, they were guarded with Jewish
 police. They just had armbands, they didn™t 
have any guns. They were standing on the plan
ks or going behind the wagon if a potato fell off, 
they picked it up and put it back 
in the wagon and things like that.  Potatoes came in and flour 
came in and beets came  a nd flour came.  Don™
t forget, after all they had 160,000 Jews. The 

Jews baked their own bread but to work in th
e bakery was a privilege. You had to know 
some body, because you were allowed to eat in the 
baker, your bellyful, all you can eat.  If you 
work in the kitchen, you could eat 
all you want.  It was a privilege 
to work in the kitchen or to 
work in a bakery. 
 
Q: So people were better off? 

 

A: We re better off because you had your re
gular rations plus you ate on the job. 
 

Q: You said some thing earlier about the underg
round, getting infor mati
on about these possible 
things from the underground. Wa s th
ere pretty exte
nsive underground? 
 

A: I don™t know underground but I know from the be
ginning, in 1940, I me an the ghetto was really 
closed but people had connections.  Maybe th
ey came through tunnels or ma ybe they came 
through the wires underneath or ma ybe Jews, they 
took out Jews for work from the ghetto every 
day from the beginning. They were de molishing houses around the ghetto because the Germans 

want to build a no-ma n™s-land around the ghetto. 
This was near the Jewish quarter and they 
figure ma ybe the Jews have a lot of valuables 
hidden there. They just knocking down whole 
blocks of houses.  Maybe outside, maybe they 
came in contact with Poles or some thing like 
that.  Ma ybe some  news filtered through.  I reme mbered you went to a barbershop or  

some thing, the latest gossip was exchanged there.  Some how t he news filtered through. 
 

Q: How long were you in the ghetto? 

 

A: I was in the ghetto since they closed 
it off. I left the ghetto in March 10, 1944. 
 
Q: You were there from 1940 
or you were there from 1939? 
 
A: The ghetto wasn™t  a ghetto then. There was th
is section but the ghetto 
was closed in 1940.  I 
left the ghetto in 1944 and my pare
nts were still there.  From th
e beginning I didn™t wa nt to go 
but they said the Germans need people to work fo
r the settlements.  I was hiding and then they 
threatened they going to take the ra
tion cards away from my parents --. 
 

Q: If you didn™t go? 

 

A: If I didn™t go so eventually I had 
to report. We  had to report --.  
 

Q: Had there been deportations before? 

 

A: Oh, yes, constantly. 

 

Q: Regularly? 

 

A: Back in 1942, the Germans put a curfew 
for one week, nobody could go out or in. The 
Germans are, they didn™t left it up to the Jews th
en. The Ger mans themselves, they went to --. 
                                        (End of SideA,Ta pe 1) 

 They took them to a central pl ace ,a center poin
t.  From there they came in to trucks and now 
we know what happens. They took them to the train station, put them on trucks and the Kelna, 

the extermination was only 35 kilome ters away. 
They took them right n and the trucks came  

back right away with curfew.  One day, like 
I said my father worked in the hospital; the 
Germans came, they surrounded the hospital, took all the patients out. 
 
Q: Okay so you said that your father worked 
in a hospital and they cam
e and took some  of the 
patients, or all of them? 
 

A: All of them, all of them.  
They surrounded the hospital.  I 
t was early in the morning, ma ybe 
four o™clock in the morning, they took all the pa
tients out. Then they emptied, on the same  day, 
they emptied all the hospitals, three hospitals.  
There was a hospital for the insane, they emptied 
that. They emptied orphanages 
and took all the kids out.  I forgot to me ntion as my memory 
comes back, my mother worked 
in the building, she worked in the orphanage. After this, once 
they emptied the orphanage, she had no -- then she 
start working in the kitchen, got a job in the 
kitchen, public kitchen. 
 

Q: So they took these people away? 

 

A: Yeah, but nobody knew exactly where they t
ook them. Then where the hospital was, the 
Germans ma de like a factory, 
a tailor shop or something. 
 

Q: Did they take them away in trains?  Is that 
how they deported them, they just ma rched them out 
--? 
 

A: No, they came  by with trucks. At that time
 Œ now reading the books, we know that that was the 
Einsatzgruppen, the mo bile killing units. At th
at time, they calling the road commander, they 
were on wheels on big trucks, the road command ers, they come  out and they took them by 

trucks. Whe n I me ntioned it, the Germans put a 
curfew for a week, they took in, from block to 
block, they took in with the wagons. They t
ook them to an assembly point and then the 
Germans came and took them with trucks or they 
ma rched to the train station. Also I want to 
mention that near the cemetery is a secti
on c a ll e d M a r i s h na  ne a r  
the ghetto, there was a 
sidetrack, a railroad track. They took them a
ll to the settleme nts, we
nt to this station. 
 

Q: By the cemetery? 

 

A: By the ceme t ery, was a big station nearby.  
The trains were there a
nd they took them on the 
flatcars. That™s where I le
ft, from that station too. 
 

Q: You said that these things happened often?
 That there were deportations all the time? 
 

A: Constantly, constantly.  Because they were 
bringi ng in new pe ople, they were taki ng out and 
bringing in new people.  Otherwis
e the ghetto would be a quarter of a mi llion people. This way 
they always emptied it, always empty it.  From the beginning, it was up to the local 

admi nistration who should go.  Because the German
s really didn™t care. They said we need 
7,000 people for the settleme nt, we need 900,000, 50 
hundred people so if some  people came  
from Ger ma ny,, fromAustria and they were strang
ers; they were not even
 resettled yet, they 
were just living in a building, th
ey just took them. They just 
need people, they just needed 
numbers. 
 

Q: So they weren™t concerned_______. 

 

A: We ren™tconcerned,right. 
 

Q: Did you ever hear of anybody who escaped or got 
away from some of these transports and came 
back and told what was going on or --? 
 

A: We ll, I tell you.  I didn™t know any person that 
did escape but like I me ntioned before, we knew 
in 1942, early on, that the people -- they take ou
t a few from the ghetto and they tell you like 
you™re going to a shower and they give you soap a
nd a towel.  Instead of 
water, gas come s out.  
Some body must have escaped, don™t forget I was ve
ry young then and your mi nd didn™t believe.  
I was fourteen, fifteen years old but I don™t kno
w who said it, but the news filtered through. 
 

Q: When you were deported, 
you had to leave your family? 

 

A: My fa mily was there. 

 

Q: It was just you that was deported? 

 

A: Okay. The Jews --. 

 

Q: I™m sorry.  I know what I was going to ask. 
When people were deported, when people were 
taken out of the ghetto, were they 
told where they were going or were they just told that they 
were going to be resettled in the east? 
 

A: They told them they would settle in the east.
 The ghetto, like I said, was quite a large area and 
they had like a central prison, the Jews. The pe
ople had assembled there, like I said, but some  
people, they really went for work outside the 
ghetto.  Because they had to go to a commission; 
they had German doctors and they really needed
 them to work.  But if they took everybody, 
whole fa milies, you know they didn™t take these peopl
e to work. They just said you have to be 
resettled in the east.  Li ke I said, I was hiding; 
then one day after ma ybe a week™s time  or so, I 
had to report.  So I was there fo
r three, four days in the centra
l prison.  I reme mber my father 
came the last days towards the barbed wire.  I 
reme mber the pictur e ju
st like vividly.  I 
reme mber what he looked like.  In Europe he 
was wearing boots and I re
me mber his face like --
.  So we ma rch, the next morning we ma rch to
 the train station, we ma rched, all young people, 
no adult with us. Youngsters, I was there ma ybe si
xteen, seventeen already. They put us in an 
open cart, put us in one of the good wagons, cattle ca
rs and they closed up. We  were riding for 
two, three hours. All of a sudden, they open th
e door. There was a truck waiting there and the 
Germans wa iting there.  I don™t reme mber how
 many people, ma ybe 50 pe ople from our wagon, 
whatever it was.  Maybe 50, ma ybe
 60, I didn™t count them; they took us to a labor camp.  It 
was in Kielce.  It was in southern Poland.  It™s
 spelled K-i-e-l-c-e.  
I don™t know if you heard of 
it before. They took us over there and we asked 
how -- I seen them loading up our clothes, our 

baggage. We  had on the truck and then -- they 
had already a labor camp. That camp still had 

Jews already from the surrounding 
vicinities. The camp wa s adjoining a factory. The factory 
was called Hasac.  It wa s a Polish munitions fact
ory before the war or ma ybe it was just a me tal 
factory, I don™t know. The German
s converted this to a munitions
 factory.  Over there, in 
comparison to the ghetto, was good because I had plenty food, as much as I want. The only 

this, you came in contact with the Poles. You work 
in the factory besides with the Poles.  So we 
went to the barracks after finish 
the work but they went to their homes. They promised us that 
they going to give us the clothes, I seen them
 loading the truck. We  ask them, where is the 
clothes, we never got the clothe
s.  I only had what I had on me. 

 
Q: What you came in?  

 

A: What I came  on.  I don™t know who; I was told
 later on that the people who run the camp, the 
Jews, they bartered away our clothes. Th
is is what I was told, I never seen them. 
 

Q: The clothes that you™re talki
ng about were clothes that you had brought with you and they ma de 
you give up when you got there? 
 

A: Yeah, I didn™t  have -- that™s  
right.  I seen them loading the 
truck but when I got to the camp, I 
never see anything.  I had an extra sweater, ma ybe an
 extra pants, an extra pair shoes. We  were 
all probably gone for labor work so everybody took a little bit clothes. They never gave it to us.  

This was good clothes because we took nothing but the 
best.  I could barter 
this if I had it.  I 
reme mber I just had one sweater, some I give it 
away and the Pole, the next day, brought me  a 
loaf of bread or some thing like that.  But food 
wa s relatively good because 
the locals, they were 
locals in the adjoining cities a
nd they probably came with all the 
clothes. They were bartering 
all the time  so they didn™t  eat 
in the commune kitchen. Wa s always
 a lot of food.  
Then at night, 
I could go to the Polish k
itchen if they had food left over, they gave us if I worked the night 
shift.  In comparison to the ghetto, as far 
as food was concerned, was gold.  I was alwa ys 
worried about what happened to my  parents,
 everything seemed unr
eal.  I got up in the 
morning, everything strange.  I worked in the fact
ory; I was making bullets. We put in steel and 
the machines, if you™re working steel with the mach
ines, had to have oil, constant to the oil.  
Like I said, I don™t have any clothes to ex
change nothing so_________ got all over me  and I 
developed all blisters.  I had a
ll blisters on my knee, on my feet
.  Because I had no apron, just 
plain clothes and I had nothing to
 change.  Don™t forget I me nti
oned that I had left in March, 
1944 but then the weather was getting colder.  
I went out in the morning to work. They 
ma rched us from the assembling, we  had to ma rch to factory. We  didn™t have to march too far, 

just like from here to the light  because the camp 
was attached to the factory.  But a cold day, it 
hit my flesh and it was hurting because I had blisters. When I  was in that  labor camp in Kielce, 

I heard about the invasion, the No
rmandy invasion in June 6.  I 
heard that.  But that time, I 
really didn™t know where Normandy was; I just 
heard that theAmerican
s and the British was 
there, I don™t have any perception of time; ma
ybe the camp, ma ybe two, three months.  It was 
the summer and then one morni
ng, this camp, we were guarded by the Ukrainians. A Ukrainian 
auxiliary this camp. Yo u me ntioned if so
me body escaped from the ghetto and I told you I 
didn™t know of anybody.  But from the camp, I di
d heard that they escaped, from the labor 
camp.  But t hey caught him and then they brought him back and then they shot him.  It was a 

different part of the country, 
they did escape and they brought hi
m back.This was still in the 
summertime , after the Normandy invasion.  It was in June, maybe July or ma ybeAugust, one 

morning they lined us all up and they say they 
have to evacuate because the Russian ma de the 
offensive. They were comi ng westward so they 
evacuated us and they put us in open flatcars.  
We  were riding ma ybe a day or two and then they
 let us out in an open field. They gave us 

food; the Germans were debating where they should
 take us. They didn™t know what to do with 
us -- all the people from the la
bor camp. Wa s not a big camp , 
ma ybe six, seven hundred people.  
As I me ntioned before, only about 50, 60 people.  
They had the whole wagons left over but they 
dropped them off in diff erent camps. This camp only attached this car, maybe away to  another 

couple cities, attached like a_________ camp. They 
didn™t know where to take us, we said why 
can™t  we go back -- we still in Poland -- we said 
why can™t  you take us b
ack to the Lodz ghetto?  
There™s a lot of Jews over there.  One of the 
guys told us, the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated, 

dismantled now.  Right now, we in the field, it wa
s still warm, must have been inAugust.  Now 

according to the books that I read, that was when
 the ghetto was being liquidated, in July and 
August. After a couple of days, we decided and 
they took us to a place, Shedbush. We  still in 
Poland, I find it on the map, wasn™t  far away
, ma ybe 25 miles away. Anyway it was all 
youngsters and we were digging ditches, anti-t
ank ditches. The organizationTodd was in 
charge,T- o-double-d.  It was name d after a Germ
an, it was a labor battalion or some thing like 
that. We  came, in the morning, in the daytime we
 went to dig the ditches and at night we were 
sleeping in barns, in farmers™ barns.  But at ni
ght, we heard shooting.  In the morning we got up 
and we ask the German what is all the shooting? 
We heard the partisans,
 they were attacking 
the German units or something like this in the co
untryside.  So after we dig the ditches, I don™t 
know, ma ybe for a week or so, they took us 
away to Chintzerhau_____. The Chintz_______ is 
a  -- I think it™s near Upper 
Silesia -- it™s a very well known Po
lish city. The Polish Madonna -- 
Chintz_________ is on the Polish-German border not far away in Upper Silesia. The same  

factory with the same  work that
 I did in Kielce that I did in
 Chintz________.  Over there, I me t 
my friend.  I me t my friend which I still 
keep up to now; he is in NewYork.  
 

Q: What™s  his name ?  

 

A: His name  is -- well he changed his name .  His 
name  is now Herbert Lewis.  He™s got a better 
recollection than I have.  He reme mb ers more 
than I do.  Somehow my memory fades but he™s 

got a very good recollection and I met him.  I re
me mber the day; he was wearing boots.  Over 
there ma ybe you worked about ma ybe for a mont h or two, was all_________, 1944, reme mber.  

We  went in the morning --.  He wasn™t  in Kiel
ce with Gara; he  was in a different camp.  He was 
in Scarzilsco.  By then, when the Germans 
came, they evacuated everybody and every able-
bodied me n they put in --.  He came in Chin
tz_________ and I me t hi m.  We  were working in 

the same  factory.  I don™t know if we worked th
ere for a mont h or six weeks. Anyway, it was 
still the same year; the German
s came one morning, rounded us up and ma rched us to the train 
station. They put us on cattle cars and I coul
d see that the local population, they were running.  
We  heard distant shooting.  I don™t know, rumors spread in ou
r ranks that the Russians are 
entering the city on the other side but it wasn™t  tr
ue yet.  I could see the Germans were loading 
the big guns on the trains, the German army. Anyw
ay they put us on cattle cars. We  were gone 
for three or four days and we wind up in Germany.
 We  find out that they took us Œ we went to 
Buchenwald in the concentration camp.  Over there they opened up, we came to Buche nwald 

and everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them.The y were 

discarding the Polish money and the German Reich 
ma rks. After two, three hours, we went to 
sit in barracks. They had -- Buchenwald was a big camp, was about 60,000 inma tes at that 

time.  It was established early in 1933.  Ri
ght now, I know it was a political camp.  In 
Buchenwald heather on the ground.  But that time I 
didn™t realize, I didn™t 
realize that. Anyway 
we registered and all the inma tes did all the 
work. They ask us where we come  from, your 

mother ™s name , your father ™s name  and all this stuf
f. After registration, we went to a big hall.  
We  had to take all the clothes th
at we  wear and before I left Poland, I me ntioned that before I 
left the ghetto, my mother told me  that you have 
an aunt in Paris which I did have, her sister.  
She says you have a cousin in Belgium and sh
e gave me addressed e
nvelopes and things like 
that and says ma ybe you don™t know where you™re
 going.  Maybe you™re going to need it one 

day.  But when I went to Buchenwald and 
I had family pictures, my mother, my younger 
brother, I had to put everything on the table. A
ll the clot hes, everythi ng 
on the table and I only 
reme mber one German. A black uniformed Ger man came in, we all had to o to commission.  

He looked at my legs because like I said, from 
the dirty oil, I don™t know 
what I blubbered up in 
German.  He says, he just looke
d at me  and was thinking, thinking. 
 He just motioned at a line 
so I went over there. We  had to go in first to
 a shower.  I reme mber we
 just looking is water 

comi ng in or gas comi ng out. Wa ter was comi ng out and then we had to all to go in. They had 
a big disinfection tube, wa
s ma ybe like this room.  Had to jump
 in, oh I had all scabs over here -
-- was burning and burning.  Before this, I forgot, 
after I took all the clot
hes off and e verything, 
we went to a different room. The inma tes were 
all, the inmates had clippers. They clipping the 
head, clipping hair, clipping hair, all over there.  
Then we were all clipped up. We  ha d to jump 
into this tub, this di
sinfect thing.  Oh, it was burning some thi
ng terrible. Then we jumped out.  
This was January, was already January.  _______know
s, January 18, according to the record, I 
got there, January 18. We  went up from this 
tube, oh yeah, after we got up from the tube, I 
reme mber going up a flight of stairs. They gave 
me  clothes. They gave me  a pair boots, shoes, 
no socks. They gave me  pants but no underwear.  
They gave me  a jacket but no shirt.  I didn™t 
have the striped jacket, just because, don™t forget
, it was January and it was already chaos in all 
those camps.  They had so many people come from
 Ger many,  I didn™t even have a tattoo.  I just 
had an assigned number.  They gave me  all these 
clothes. Then we went out to the other end of 
the barr acks where we stand for two, three hours 
until we assigned a barr ac k.  Here it™s January, 
it™s cold. 
 

Q: You™rewet? 

 

A: You™re wet, you™re unshaved and all this stuf
f. Then they assigned us a barrack.  In the 
barracks, then I lost my friend.  He got assigned
 a different barracks. You had to slide in and 
you had to slide out. You couldn™t go in. At ni
ght, if you had to go someplace, to the bathroom, 
you were afraid to go if you leave your place. 
 Because if you™re placed in, nobody™s going to 
let you back in. 
 

Q: Oh, you me an, to slid
e back into the bunks? 
 
A: You couldn™t slide in, whatever you had to do, 
you had to make it on the spot. There was only 
straw there, there was no --. You had no blanket,
 they don™t give you a blanket, we use straw.  
To be exact, they were looking lik
e shelves, like bins.  Like y
ou see the pictures, you slide in 
and slide out.  I was in this ba
rracks and then later on -- when I 
was in the barracks, I met my 
friend.  But first of all, they had kapos in th
e barracks.  I didn™t  know what the word kapo 
means but I know people came to us and he says 
you people are newcome r s?  I says yes.  I says 
who is your leader. We  called, one
 was a Jewish policemen in th
e labor camp was this. They 
want to find out how we are treated .If we told 
him;  we are treated by ou
r own people, they kill 
him on the spot.  Because they say we  want to do an example, in case they take your people out 
for labor for a day or two to the city a
nd some body is going to inform on you, your own 
people;___________ when he come s back, he™s  going to have the same  thing.  He says we™re 

organizing the thing.  I reme mber
 one guy, he was the head of the camp.  He came  to us and 
says, don™t say anything bad.  Because we always
 thought ma ybe we came from the ghetto from 
Lodz, they didn™t give us our clothes, we coul
d have lived better.  Buy diff erent food, but I  
don™t know what happened to him.  Maybe some
body else squealed on him, ma ybe not, I don™t 
know.  I was in that camp and then I me t my frie
nd, it was nice. The first day, when I assigned 
my rations, I put it in my  pocket.  I figure I™m
 going to eat it later on. You get one day of 
rations, a piece of bread and a bowl of soup so I fi
gure I™m going to eat the bread at night.  So at 
night, I went to eat, the bread wa
s gone.  Some body slipped it out a
nd I didn™t feel it.  I figured 
out, don™t ask me  know but I don™t 
know.  I reme mber one thing, I sewed up my pockets.  Don™t 
ask me  wher e I got the needle and where I go
t the thread.  Some body must have had it.  I 
punched a hole in the jacket thr
ough here and I was slitting out to
 here. While I was in this 
barrack, they took out people for work, the kapos.
 They had people in the barracks, they had 

people -- Germans, they had Russians who pr
eceded us to Buchenwald.  Some  people who 
came ma ybe  in 1939, in 1940, in 1938, they were in char
ge of the barracks, they were in charge.  
The kapos, they had to go to a special appellplat
z, the ma in camp where they counted them. We  
had to go to a different spot too.  Some ti me s, 
we  stayed for two, three hours in the snow, don™t 

forget it was January. The snowflakes they were
 falling; he counted us up, then dismissed.  
Then dismisses, you went into a cold barrac
k.  If you had a piece of bread left over in the 
morning, you ate it.  If not, nothing.  In daytime,
 in the morning, we heard a whistle blowing.  
They took us for work, from the barracks, just to
 drag wood because you have to remember that 
Buchenwald was carved out from a forest.  I don™t 
know if you™re familiar or not.  It™s ten miles 
away fromWe i mar.  It™s a lot of birch trees a
nd forest.  Maybe they need the wood, maybe they 
didn™t need it. They just ma ke you work. They
 don™t let you just stay around idle. They were 
taking us out for work every day. 
 

Q: You were just cutting wood, 
is that what you were doing? 

 

A: No, I reme mber I was dragging wood.  I don™
t reme mber where I was dragging it, maybe 
putting it in one pile, taking to 
the other pile, everybody had to work.  Over there -- I was doing 
this ma ybe for a month or for two mo nths. Then 
all of a sudden, one day,
 they announce they --
-. Then we heard, like I told you, the kapos had 
a separate room in the barracks.  Have you ever 

been to service 
in the army?  
 

Q: No. 

 

A: No.  In the barracks itself, they had a couple 
rooms, in the barracks carved out for the kapos.  
They weren™t exactly mean, they were kapos, they
 were in charge of the barracks, know what I 

mean? 
 

Q: We re the kapos, were they Jewish, or were they --? 

 

A: No, well in this instance they happened to be 
--.  I knew a couple of them were Russians, two, 
three Russians.  One of them was Ge rman.  Mayb
e they were ex-prisoners of war.  Or ma ybe 
they were just taken to Ge rmany for labor a
nd some how they wind up in a conservation camp.  
I didn™t ask any specific.  I know one was -- a co
uple were German.  One was a green triangle, 
means he was a criminal prisoner.  One had a red 
triangle, means he was a political .  Outside the 
barracks, they had detached, likea small cottage. They were only German, kapos. They were 

not kapos but I don™t know what they were doing. They were prisoners, they were dressed 

nicely, they had red triangles and 
they were in boots, they were nice. They didn™t take --they 
had connections in the camp but they 
were prisoners, you know what I me an? 
 

Q: So the prisoners were treated differently depe
nding on what kind of prisoner you were?   Li ke if 
you were a political prisoner, you were tr
eated better than sa
y a Jewish person? 
 

A: I don™t know whether they were treated better 
than --.  But if some body had to do manual labor, 
they were in charge of the au
to workme n.  I f somebody had to drag woods, he didn™t have to 
drag the woods. 
 

Q: So there was defi nitely 
a differentiation between --? 

 

A: Sure.We  have the kapos differently  But if
 he was a_________ma ybe he wasn™t  abused to other 

prisoners but you had to do it.  But they had to
 go to the appells too.  So all of a sudden, one 
day they announce they evacuated Buchenwald. 
 I heard the kapos talking, they bombe d, the 
Americans are already in Erfut.  Erfut spelled E-
e-f-u-t. You ever heard of the word, Erftut?   
It™s not far fromWe i mar.  Buchenwald was nearWe i mar, ten miles away. They would be here 
soon so they took the Jews. They™re taking the Jews. 
 

Q: Do you remember what time this was?   
It was in /45, do you reme mber the month?  
 

A: That must be in February because it was stil
l cold. Wa s a very short span.  I was only three 
months in Buchenwald so I can go back, was in Fe
bruary.  So they say`, they going to evacuate, 
they going to take the Jews. All 
the Jews have to report.  I knew
 if they take the Jews, I know 
what™s  going to happen. 
 

Q: They only took the Jews at this point? 

 

A: To report. They were all mi xed in
 this camp, mi xed Jews and non-Jews,__________and 
Frenchme n. They said all the Jews have to repor
t, evacuated.  So the way they did that, they 
says, they emptied all the barrack
s in a big place, in a big sq
uare and they says everybody on 
this side. Then they have this kapo, lined up, like I said, Russians, Germans, and you had to 

approach.  If they recognize a Je
w, you™re on this side in there.  I passed by, they knew me  but 
they let me  through. 
 

 

Q: They let you on the political side? 

 

A They let me  on the other side .  I didn™t  go in
 the Jewish transport. 
 I don™t know.  Maybe they 
didn™t recognize me , I didn™t ask any questions.  He 
just send me  so I didn™t  go with the Jewish 
transport. Then another day, they did the sa
me  thing.  I hid underneath the barracks.  Some  
kapos came in and they pull us out from undern
eath the benches.  I reme mber some body gave 
me a kick and my back was hurting maybe for a 
week or so. Then I me t my friend.  He was 
hiding too, he was in a different barracks. 
 Finally they says, everybody has to go.  So 
everybody has to go, alright.  So we line all up and we went to the ma in camp to Buchenwald.  

They kept us there in a big hall.  Don™t ask 
me  what kind, I reme mber 
it was a big hall, they 
kept us overnight and the next 
day too. Towards dusk, they says
, now we™re going to go to the 
train station. They let us out from the bi
g, looked like a factory type building.  I would 
recognize it now.  Now you have 
to describe, they had the Germ
an SA, youngsters, one side.  
They had big bat and we had to 
this and they were beating you. 
 

Q: Like a gauntlet or some thing? 

 

A: Like a gauntlet right.  I want
 to say like a gangplank but Idon™t want to use the word, a 
gangplank is like a ramp. You know like a gangplank.  I don™t reme mber if I receive d a blow, if 

I didn™t receive the blow. 
 

Q: They just hit you? 

 

A: Yeah, they had three, four on this on this side; 
three or four on this side. Then the other side, 
they lined us up; they lined us up. 
 

Q: They had like clubs, is that what you mean?  
 

A: Clubs, or bats or truncheons.  Maybe they had 
plain stakes. Who reme mbers?  You see all these 
things lie down, they beating 
the things, you don™t pay attention 
what it wa s. Who knows what 
it was, I don™t  reme mber. Anyway after you went 
through this gauntlet, they lined us up and it 
was already dusk like I said and we ma rched to 
Wei mar. The Germans marched us toWei mar. I 
reme mber they had big dogs on the sides, big German shepherds. They came to the train 

station, I think it was really dar
k. They put us in open flatca
rs, was already dark, ma ybe ten, 
eleven o™clock at night.  I don™
t have any perception of time.  
The trains start moving.  So the 
trains start moving; we moved 
overnight and then in the daytime, planes came and shot up, 
 

Qﬂ They shot up at the trainﬂ. 

 

A: At the train.  Some body asked what
 is the name  of this place?  
 I heard them say Zeis.  I don™t 
know, some place in Germany, Zeis, Z-
e-i-s.  I think right now, I™m not so sure but I heard Zeis 
where they ma ke optical equipment over there. You heard of that thing?  
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: It says we in Zeis or some
thing like that.  Maybe where -- th
en the Germans assembled another 
locomotive after the pl anes left  and we were ri
ding again. Then the planes came  and shot up 

again.  So they assembled us all in column
s I don™t know, ma ybe 5,000 people.  Don™t forget 
they say they empty Buc henwald, not all of them
. They marched us to Flossenburg. This is 
another camp.  I don™t know how 
you spell Flossenburg, it™s nearWe iden.  Right now I™m 
reading all the books.  I™m interested because I 
lived this pe riod; I know that right now from 
history was a criminal camp.  One of the Germa
n,Admi ral Kanaris, he was head of the German 
Upfeur, German intelligence.  He got hung up over there.  In the mi ddle of the story or  not.  
Over there, was even worse than Buchenwald 
because we were sleeping --.  I was with my 

friend there from NewYork and we
 sleeping that camp ma ybe  for a week or so. Then they say 
they evacuated Flossenburg.Thy ma rched us out fr
om Flossenburg to the train. That was in the 
morning, ma ybe eleven o™clock.  I think it 
was on a Sunday, I don™t know why I reme mber 
Sunday but I have stuck in my head, Sunday. 
 I know the sun was shining high and the train 
station was right outside of the camp and they lo
ading us in open boxcars, listen to that.The 
trains didn™t even start moving yet. All of a s
udden, I see planes from far away.  Big planes in 
the sky and the sun shines on them, I think that 
was the jet age comi ng out.  In a second, they 
were right over the train -- shot
 everything up. All of a sudden, I 
heard some thing hit my face.  
I asked my friend, do I ha ve blood on my face?   He just looked, he says no.  But I looked up 

and I see that we were not moving yet. They 
had a big sign, crossing written down in German, 
ma de out of wood. A crossing sign, you know, maybe
 one of the splinters, some  bullet too, hit 
me  in the fa ce.  But nothing was bleeding, it wa
s nothing, some thing hit me . When t he planes 
shot up the train, everybody jumped off the train 
so I jumped off the train too. The Germans 
were running to the farmhouses, to the nearby hous
es.  I run after them too.  I heard them, run 
into German, must have been a German house or
 some thing, I wasn™t  the only one, maybe there 
were dozens of legs, we run with the guards. 
 

Q: Everybody was running? 

 

A: We  were running. The guard says, I heard him,
 I understood this much Ge rman.  He sa ys, the 
Americans must have a base nearby because the 
plane left already. They going to be comi ng 

back.  But then after everything was over, the guar
ds came back. We  ca me  back to the train too.  
But not everybody went with the guards. 
 
Q: Peopleranaway? 

 

A: No, some of them stayed with the -- on the 
wagons. They were going through the packages, the 
Germans™ knapsacks.  
 

Q: St ealing the food and stuff? 

 

A: Just with them open. They 
took out the cigarettes, they took out the food. When the Germans 
came and they saw what™s  going on, they lined everybody up. They searched everybody. They 

found food on them and cigarettes a
nd lined them up and killed them on the spot. After a while, 
they assembled us all and the train start moving again, whoever was left. The ones who was 

killed, I don™t  know if they buried 
them or left them on the side or took them back to camp. The 
camp was maybe a few miles outside. We  didn™
t even left -----__________. We  wer e  riding 
again, ma ybe for a day or two.  Planes used to
 come , theAme r icans and British were already 
nearby. They didn™t have far to go. They were al
ready in France. They shooting at the planes.  
The guard says, some  of them just flew over an
d they didn™t come  down low so the guard says 
over there they™re your friends.  If they come  over, you wave to them, so we waved, we had no 

choice, we waved.  Some  just flew over, they
 didn™t do anything.  Some t i me s they came down 
low. When they came down low, the guards run out.  Some  of us were packed in the station.  

When the planes came over, I coul d see the tracer 
bullets.  I could see them
 just like rains, hard 
rains you can see them.  I jumped off the train. 
 I hid underneath the wagon where the planks 
are. 
 
Q: Where the tracks are?  
 

A: Where the tracks are.  I just lay there and I 
could see the guards, were
 all on the train. After 
this, after it was all over, we went back.  I re
me mber it was British planes. Why do I know it™s 
British?  Because I could see the wheel, the mark with the red. 
 

Q: Like a bull™s eye? 

 

A: That™s right, like a bull™s eye. They came very 
low.  I could see the markings then. Then they 
shot up the locomotive. Then we left another da
y and the same  thing happen.  Here they come  

again. 
 

Q: So they would come  every day to shoot up? 

 

A: Every day, some times twice a day.  I don™t kno
w if you™ve ever been in
 Bavaria or Germany; 
they have thick_________tunnels over there,
 you know__________tunnels. As soon as they 
heard the air drone or some thing like this, the 
loco motive detached itself and it went for the 
nearest tunnel. After the ride 
was over, if the loco motive was in
tact, it wasn™t  shot up, they 
could use it.  It came back and they pull off agai
n.  But if the locomotive didn™t have time , they 
had to get some thing else.  But anyway, they
 shot up a locomo tive the last time and they 
couldn™t get anybody so a big fat German says, 
e verybody line up. Whoe ver cannot -- we going 
to ma rch from now on. Whoever cannot ma rchdoesn™t  have to worry, we going to provide 

transportation.  I know what transportation means. 
 I was the first in line.  Now I can see how 

lucky I am because, don™t forget, I was in this labor camp, like I mentioned before the food was 
relatively good.  I could barter, the 
locals, so it wa s more food left for me .  I was in the kitchen 
at night and it was food and the camp was only fo
r about three months so I was in relative good 
health.  I was in the first line over ther e. We
 marched all night, me  
and my  friend from New 
York. Then at night, we wind up near the roadside  and we took a little bi
t leaves and they says 
you™re going to spend the night over there. The next night the same  thing.  But the third night, 

was raining bad.  I got soaked all through, all we
t. Whoever fell out of line, if you read the 
story about Bataan or Corregidor,
 the same  thing.  I was ready, my friend was ready, I was ready 
to go the roadside but my friend who liv
es in NewYork, he says, come  on. 
 

Q: He wouldn™t let you go? 

 

A: He pulled me, yeah.  I wa s tripping over wire
s because they were shooting. The planes were 
comi ng down, two, three times a day. All the wires were down, it was dark.  I was ready to give 

up; he says, he grabs me  he says 
you got to keep ---.  So towards 
-- that was at night. We  were 
ma rching all night, all we t, you couldn™t walk, soaked through. Towards morning, it was 

already daybreak, we stopped on a farm and they put us in barns. They says you™re going to 

rest here, the guards. All of a sudden, decide
 to take us all out for punishment because 
somehow, somebody, they were messing up the barns.
 There were no toilets there. They were 
lining everybody up. They going to take us to
 a ma rch or ma ybe, who knows. The Germans 
had a tendency.  If some body did any infracti
ons, they lined everybody up and they picked 
people at random. They lined them up and they
 says I™m going to pick every third man, or 
every tenth ma n. They just pull them out and theyjust shot them just for no reason at all.  So 

ma ybe they tried to do the same  thing this time . When they were getting ready, everybody lined 

up, we heard shooting.  So the German says ever
ybody back inside the barn. Then the shooting 

intensified.  Like I me ntioned, it™s a barn. A barn
 has slits so some  of the inma tes looked --.  
Before I me ntion that, for some  reason an e
gg fell down, a chicken egg fe ll down and my friend 
was nearby. We took the egg and we split it in ha
lf, a fresh egg. While we were sitting in the 

barn, like I me ntioned before, it was raining all ni
ght and the barn is warm near the hay and the 
straw, our clothes is steaming.  
We  heard the shooting and we  looked out.  Some  of t he inma tes 
says, the Russians are here. They saw the stars.
 At that time, we di
dn™t know theAmerican 
tanks have stars too. We  know the Russians have st
ars. Then we notice in the front of the barn 
the guards taking white handkerchiefs, or white ra
gs or whatever it was white and put on the 
front of their rifles. You know what I am talking about? 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: I was one of the last ones to 
get out of the barn.  I got out of the barn just like you see in a 
movie picture.  Everything burns around you.  
You™re a farmhouse; a farmhouse burns here; a 
barn burns here. All the inma tes in the thousan
ds, all running wild. All uniforms, all kind of 
uniforms.  Don™t forget they evacuated th
e camp like Buchenwald in the thousands.The 
Germans ha d the transport too with them. They
 had the carts and the horses and some motor 
transports. All of a sudden you see the inma tes 
they robbing the wagons and all the stuff.  I 
went to a wagon too, seeing some  German boots.  I 
had no shoes, I put on a pair of boots.  I had 
no size, just pulled them on.  
Like I me ntioned before, don™t forget, I said I sewed up the 
pockets.  I go over there and I see a big Germ
an woman.  She has a 
big country bread all 
around.  She cut slices and here the inma tes stay 
and everybody gets a big slice of bread. Ta ke 
a big, line the lines, she gives me  a slice of brea
d too. Then I go to the next house and I see raw 
potatoes outside.  I take these 
raw potatoes and I star
t packing them inside.  I™m all weighed 

down, heavy.  I go the next farmhous e, some body preceded me  already. They all Russian 
inmates, Russian- speaking inmt es. 
 

Q: They ate all the food? 

 

A: They already killed the chic
ken. They already picking the f
eathers off.  Some body very quick, 
they were right there.  Maybe they got liber
ated 15, 20 mi nutes before, who knows. Then we 
saw tanks rumbling by and they 
throwing down cigarettes. Then we go to a clearing and we 
saw tanks parked and we go over to some body. 
 Some body ask what language you speak. We  

said, well we from Poland. We  find a Polish-
American.  He speaks in broken Polish.  He goes 
to the truck and brings the car
e rations up.  Now I know they car
e rations, the cheese and the 
candy was there.  Some body gets us cigarettes and 
I start to smoke.  I™ m all dizzy.  So I go to 
the next village. The village not far away, ma ybethree miles.  Don™t forg et there are thousands 

of people in the villages.  I see a German stay
s outside.  I says food, essen.  He says, yah, yah, 
come  inside.  I thought I™m going to be the onl
y one.  I think I went with some body too.  
Somebody was besides me there. I go in and the pl
ace is full. They™re already sleeping on the 
bed and under the table.  Here™s coffee.  I says
 coffee and he says yah, coffee, coffee, eggs, 
eggs, milk. Anyway I ate eggs and the next da
y my stomach was sick.  I™m sick and in the 
meanti me  they catching -- don™t forget next day af
ter the war, they bringing Germans back to 
recognize a guard here and some  bea t en to deat
h, some  all bloodied up. They picking German 
up from the house, inma tes all over, in the thous
ands, Russians, ex-pris
oners, they™re stronger 
than I am.  I™m young, I™m 16, they™re stronger th
an I am.  I™m young, I™m 16, they™re in 30™s, 
35. They entered the war, they know all 
about it. That was 
the liberation day. 
 

Q: Do you remember what day you were liberated on? 

 
A: Yeah.  It™s going to
 be this week, this 23
rd
 ofApril.  I always thought the 24
th
 and I call my 
friend in NewYork.  He says the 23
rd
 ofApril. As a ma tter of fact, because the paper I just 
show you from the tracing bureau, it doesn™t  say wh
en I was liberated but it  (End ofTa pe 1) 
 
Q: Goahead. 

 

A: I went to Schwandorf and I heard the Jews we
re assembled, all the ex-p
risoners over there.  
They ma de a____________and the wome n ex-prisoners
, they went nuts on the kitchen.  I don™t 
know if I should say it on tape, that™s the firs
t time I saw a black person. All of a sudden, I see 
anAmerican army transport pulls up; I saw the bl
acks of the transportation departme nt. At that 

time the army thing was still segr egated then. A 
guy opens the tailgate an
d I take a look and I 
see black hands.  I just looked -- the first time  . 
That™s the first time I™ve 
seen one, I didn™t see it, 
that™s it.  Okay so I was in that home and I didn™t have much c l othes.  Some  of them, like I said, 

some of the ex-inmates were smarter and wiser th
an I am, some  of the m went to German homes 
and who was an ex-Nazi. They says, listen, 
you were a Nazi or you we
re the buegermeister, 
give me  some clothes, give me  that.  So they 
came with clot he s, with sweaters and jackets.  I 

was young, I was 17, 18, I didn™t know what I wanted
 to do.  I want to go back to Poland.  
Don™t forget, this happened inApril and I left
 home  in March, the ghetto, about a year I think 
since I left home.  I still wa
s home sick, I was thinking about 
Poland and my brother and my 
sister. At that time , don™t forget the fi rst w
eek, we  didn™t know the extent, what happened with 
Auschwitz and all the sick, Kelman and all this c
oncentration camp.  I still wanted to go back to 
Poland.  I was in this home . All of a sudden, 
American soldiers came, one or two, I don™t 
reme mber.  He was a JewishAmerican soldier.  He
 says we are in tents 
here on the outskirts of 

the city in Sc heondorf. We  are in camp, we need about three, four volunteers  who wants to go 
to work.  Like washing pots and pans in the 
kitchen.  I says, I volunt
eer to go.  I went and 
another couple boys and ma ybe two, three boys. We
 had a ball, all the oranges we want to eat 
and had a couple of -- I had an Italian cook, 
anAmerican cook, Italian. ________from Chicago, 
a few Polish words and he ma de spaghetti and it
 was good.  Oh the spaghetti, anything, I didn™t 
mi nd to was h the pots and pans. All of a sudde
n, chewing gum and candy; they were living in 
tents on the outskirts of the city
.  In the evening, they brought us
 back to that house where we 
sleeping over there. The next morning, he said
 would you like to come  back tomorrow, I says 
yes. The truck came like 8 o™clock, 9 o™clock, I don™t reme mber. 
 

Q: To pick you up? 

 

A: Picks us up, the three or four 
boys went out to camp. This last
ed about for three weeks. Then, 
he said well, we have to leave, we have assi
gnments. We  have to pull down the tent, we™re 
going to Nuremberg.  I reme mber it was a big ta
ll guy, anAmerican, don™t ask me  the name , I 
forget.  I don™t know if he was a sergeant or not 
and he says we™re going to Nuremberg.  He said 
but we going to come  back and get you boys.  I di
dn™t think anything of it.  He™s  leaving, he™s  
leaving. After ma ybe two, three weeks, this 
guy shows up.  He shows up and he says you want 
to go to Nuremberg?   I says sure.  I had no re
latives, nothing attached.  
I didn™t have to pack 
because I had nothing, maybe I acquired an add
itional sweater or ma ybe an additional pair 
pants, I don™t reme mber. There™s nothing to speak of, I just took it and he picked us up and 

went to Nuremberg.  In Nuremberg, there were te
nts too.  I don™t reme mber what the name  of 
the engineer or Battalion of Engineering or some
thing like that. Then, the same thing, all the 
food and all the --. 
 

Q: You were working for them?   Doing odd jobs? 
 
A: Yeah, no, no money, nothing.  Maybe whatever it is
, they gave us clothing, they gave us shoes, 
army fatigues, army boots, whatever you need Œ 
a shirt, underwear, green underwear. Then they 
said, all of a sudden, they had to leave too, after 
two, three months.  By that time , I wa s working 
over there, I also find out that 
the size of this was Nurems bek. There is a sizeable Jewish 
community in Furt.  Furt, it™s Bavaria too.  It™s
 spelled F-u-r-t. We  took the streetcar from 
Nuremberg and you went to Furt. They had  
Jewish community there and they were all 
newcomers and had a home  too.  Just like a house 
but I was not living in this house.  I think we 
all had a tent to ourselves, was handy there. At 
that time  came to go too. So they said they™re 
going back to the United St ates but before they sa
y, they pack for their vacation. They going to 
leave from Marseilles, France. So they had tw
o choices. We  can either leave you in Germany 
and find you another job with theAmerican army or
 we can give you back to France. At that 
time France was right after post-war in ™45, they 
could bring across the bor
der. You know in 
™45, is everything chaos still.  He says -- we figur
e, well if they going to dump us off i n France, 
we™re on  our own, don™t know anybody.  Here I fi
nd up, the community of Furt and things like 
that.  I felt already a little bond.  So he says
 why don™t you find us a job here?   Next to the 

where they had the tents, was theAmerican hospita
l.  I have letters from the hospital. They 
give letters of recomme ndation, 381
st
 Evacuation Hospital or  something like this. We decide to 
work over there and they give us
 quarters and they give us food. 
 Like I said, we had all the 
clothes, we had a room.  Inside, 
was no tents, already in the hospita
l, had separate rooms, three, 
four boys.  In the morning, we just went to work
 in the kitchen. We  were not cooking; they had 
army cooks. You know what we were in charge
? We  were lighting the stoves. You reme mber 
the field army stoves, are you fa miliar with that? 

 
Q: Yeah, I™ve seen those before, yeah. 

 

A: You pump gas and you clean them and you repair
 them.  Over there, I don™t know.  I work for 
the hospital for three, four years.
  I think later on and I got paid
 for that too --but it™s  so long 
ago.  I think later on they
 transfer because they had German 
civilians working too. We  went in 
the German economy. Then, like I said, my 
friend, the one I spend the wa r with, he found 
hims elf a job too.  He found hims el
f a job in the adjoining city w
ith theAmerican army too.  He 
told me  he heard -- heard a lot of the people who 
are liberated, they go toAmerica. They have 
relatives but I didn™t have anybody so nothing to cl
aim. Then he told me  that if you go to 
Munich, Congress passed a law, he told me  theAmerican governme nt -- I didn™t know the 

difference between Congress and no Congress that so
me  displaced person they can register with 

the Joint.  He went first and he came back, he sa
ys yes, you can register. 
 I went there too and I 
regist ered and I had a very easy time because af
ter the war I worked.  I had recommendations 
from the army, had a good police record. Then I re
gistered and I was -- oh ye
s, then I think that 
I went to be on my own.  I still worked for the hos
pital, I worked for a while but I didn™t want to 
live over there.  Because in the evening I want to 
be free.  I want to be with my own people and 
I put an ad in the paper.  I™m looking for a room
.  Rooms are very hard to get in Germany after 
the war.  But I me ntioned, I want to me ntion that a lot of German Jews came back, German 

Jews after the war. They were liberated or so
me  ma ybe were never in a camp; they were mi xed 
ma rriages and ma ybe the Germans didn™t touch th
em. Anyway I went once to a service in 
Nuremberg, Jewish service. There were a lo
t of German Jews there who came back from 
Theresienstadt and things like th
at.  I find out that they had ve
ry high positions in the post-war 
governme nt in Germany right after the war.  I want
 to live on my own.  I talked to them and one 
told me  he works in this mi nistry, the other in th
e other mi nistry.  So I put an ad in the paper, I 
want to be on my own for a room.  I got a res
ponse like in a post office box.  I went to look at 
the room and the room was right near the Palace of Justice, near the military tribunal, where 

they tried the Nazis. As a matter of fact, th
e building was right across the street, I seen the 
Soviets on the balcony. They were living ther
e too. The people who we
re attached to the 
Justice, to the Russian delegati
on. Anyway I looked at the room and the lady asked me what I 
do.  I told her I am working at the hospital.  She says yeah?   I says I™m Jewish.  She says oh, 

yeah. After the war, everybody had a Jewish re
lative.  She says you know what, I registered 
this room, she says, with the government because I don™t want them to assign me a newcomer 

from -- an ethnic German from the displaced, fr
om Schlis____ or some thing like this.  If you 
can get it, if some how you can br
ing a certificate that you want the 
room.  I  ma de contact with 
this German mi nistry.  I tell him, listen I have
 a room but I need assignment.  No problem, he 

gave me an assignment, I was living over there. Then my pa pers came through. They call me 

to the council.  I had to give the birth certifi
cate.  I don™t have a birth certificate, if you come  
from Europe, everything was taken away. Th
at was relatively easy, you find people from your 
hometown. They know I™m from Pol and so I ha
d this witnesses where I wa s born, where I™m 
from and I assembled different papers. We  get them translated into English.  I went for the 

interview.  Fi nally I got toAmerica. 
 

Q: When did you come  toAmerica? 

 

A: I cameAugust 31, 1949.  Before I came  toAmeri
ca, I was in a camp, in a transit camp .  N the 
transit camp , they give you orientation, what to
 expect inAmerica. They gave you a booklet, 
what you should expect. They gave you a booklet 
in your own language, wh
atever you read the 
best.  I took a book in Polish becau
se I understood this language th
e best. They say, the booklet 

is from -- it sayWa shington, D.C. is the seat of
 the governme nt and NewYork is a big city and 
things like that.  So I read all about it.  
I came on the ship_____________.  It took us eight days.  
I didn™t get sick on the boat, a lot of people sick
 around me . The boat came  to Ne wYork harbor 
like in the evening. All of a sudden when you co
me from Eur ope, from post-war Europe and 
we were outside in the harbor, we didn™t go in
to NewYork harbor. We  just stayed there 
overnight but you could see the car
s moving, they looked like, it™s
 a sight when you come  from 
Europe and you don™t see all the stre
ets and the lights and fire way ove
r --.  Everything is alive, 
you see NewYork City.  Especially when you s
ee from far away.  Maybe it was five miles 
away, out to the harbor. We  stayed overnight 
on the boat. Wh en the mi st start lifting in the 
morning, I don™t know whether it wasAugust, it 
got daylight ma ybe 5 o™clock, ma ybe 5:30 , I 
don™t know, it was already mi st.  I went outside.  
We  couldn™t sleep already all night, passed the 
St atue of Liberty.  I read of the St atue of Li
berty in the book so I knew the St atue of Liberty.  
We  passed it and the boat anchored. Then immi
gration came on the board. We  had papers and 
everythi ng.  I became legitimate. We didn™t go to 
Ellis Island. They put a pin on my lapel.  I 
came through the Joint distribution.  Some body s
ponsored me but I don™t know who did.  It 
came t5he group but some body must ha
ve did it. They had different nationalities. They always 

had to have Catholics, they came to Catholic 
organizations, they had Jewish, they came  to a 
Jewish organization.  Maybe they had Quakers 
through a different organization. Anyway, these 
different organization, my pin, they came  toward
s me .  I didn™t know this people but they could 
tell. 
 

Q: They approached you? 

 

A: They approached me . They said, yeah. We ll, 
I spoke a little bit Englis
h but they assign people 
like to speak in --. 
 
Q: Tr anslators,yes. 
 

A: Tr anslators, they spoke likeYi ddish,American
s who spokeYi ddish. They took us over there.  
My luggage consisted of an old valise, lock-top 
and springs, they had no 
problem.  He s till had 
to go through customs.  Now I know they™re cu
stoms, they open up and they™re looking. They 
assign you right there. You go on the other side and you get doughnuts and coffee.  Doughnuts 

and coffee and then I saw aYi ddish-speaking 
woma n come s t o me .  Re me mber that I had 
nothing to carry.  I didn™t need a porter.  Sh
e says you come  with me .  I reme mber riding 
escalators.  It must have been Penn St ation or some thing, I don™t know.  I reme mber going to 

taxi, another taxi, ma ybe it was.  I reme mber ri
ding escalators and taking 
with the gate. There 
were a lot of people outside th
e gate0.  She says, she gives 
me  two tickets and she says, you 
going toWa shington D.C.When the gate opens up, th
ere will be a train there. When the people 

go down, she didn™t even wait until the gate 
opens up, when the people go down, you go down 
the stairs and you get on the train with the ot
her people and you get off inWa shington D.C. 
 

Q: Wa s there any reason that you went to 
Wa shington?  They just sent you there? 
 

A: We ll, I tell you.  Right now, I cannot think of
 any reason because I put in my papers that I 
worked in theAmerican army in the kitchen.  
Maybe they figured there™s a lot of hotels in 
Wa shington, D.C., ma ybe he can find a job in a 
-- I don™t know. They sent me  toWa s hington, 
D.C.. They just send me  there, I don™t  know.  
I™m going toWa shington, D.C. and they gave me  
three dollars.  She gave me  th
ree dollars, threeAmerican dollars and says, you buy lunch on the 
train.  She says inWa shington, D.C. you wear this pin and some body is going to approach you.  

Okay, so the gate opens up and everybody goes down. The doors slide open and I go inside.  
Everyone sits down and I sit down too.  Now I™ m ready Œ I says I got to go toWa shington, D.C.  

They said how about I mi ss it, but I read Ph
iladelphia in the book. They told you about the 
Liberty Bell Œ they have all th
ese things written down in th
e book. All of a sudden I spot 
American Legionnaires and they hadWa shington, 
D.C. on Le gionnaires™  cups.  So I thought to 
myself whe n they get off, I™m going to get off too.  I had doughnuts and I had the coffee and I 

had the three dollars in my pocke
t.  I said I™m not going to spe
nd the three dollars to buy lunch 
because I don™t know when I™m going to get anAm
erican dollar next.  I will not go in and have 
no_______. What I™m going to do, I don™t know.  I didn™t spend the lunch and didn™t buy 

anything.  I™m getting off inWa shington, D.C..  Ev
erybody is getting off t he train. At that time 
the train wasn™t  yet the jet industry devel
oped. The train was already a________, if some body 
traveled by train especially in 1949, Union St a
tion was crowded.  Everybody getting off, I™m 
getting off.  I™m getting off waiting the ma in concour
se, the main hall.  I™ m just waiting there.  I 
have the valise.  I have my best clothes from Ge
r many after the war.  I ha
ve a suit on and lapel.  
The hall empties and nobody is approaching me . 
 Nobody.  I wait and wait.  If you wait for 
some body a nd you wait for ten mi nutes, it sounds 
like an hour especially
 when you™re in a 
strange country.  
 

Q: You don™t know anybody there? 

 

A: Know anybody.  I walk a li
ttle bit around.  I remember I wrot
e the book and I wrote about the 
Tr avelAid Society.  I look in.  
What™s it called,TravelAgent? No. 
 

Q: Tr avel ,Agency or --? 

 

A: No, not a travel bureau, usually militar
y men go inside too like they help out. 
 

Q: I know what you™re talking about. 

 

A: It™s a travel-aid. They just
 do volunteer work for people who ar
e stranded.  It™s not a regular 
travel agency where you pay money.  I says ma ybe
 I should go in here and tell them that I™m 
lost.  I go by and I look in and 
I see a sailor sitt
ing there talking to some
body so I hesitated.  I 
says no I™m going to wait another five mi nutes and 
the concourse is already empty. Then all of 
a sudden I see a couple or wome n. They comi ng to
wards me. They mu st have spot me  the way 
I™m dressed. They comi ng towards me and I had 
to see the boat. They had a car, they all 
volunteers. To me  they probably wait.  Maybe th
ey couldn™t fi nd any volunteer, were late. We  
walk out Union St ation and the first thing you see is 
the Capitol.  I says this is theWhi t e House?   
No, they correct me , that is the Capitol.  It ne
ver made any difference to me why is the Capitol 
so white.  It all depends on wh
ich angle you look at theWhite House, at the portico, it looks 
like Capitol too. Anyway we got in
 their car and they took me  to 18
th
 St reet, near the zoo over 
there.  It was a boarding house and they says you 
going to be here. They told me  the next day, 
leave it to the Jewish Social ServiceAgency. Th
ey wrote down the address. The Jewish Social 

ServiceAgency at that time was on Spring Road which is right at 14
th
 Street. There was no 
suburbs then and being I was Columb ia Road, ri
ght near the zoo which isAda ms-Morgan now 

and Spring St reet is not --. They
 gave me  the address, I can take
 the bus.  Over there, I was ---
the lady she had lot a -- the Jewish
 Social Service paid her money.  She put newcome r s up with 
food.  She gave me  a room, she had a rooming house.  She says you™re going to be here until we 

find out what we going to do with you. The next
 day I went to the Jewish Social Service 
Agency and I had an interview with a Mr. Pixner.  
I think he just retired from the Jewish Social 

ServiceAgency.  He asked me  what I did and the 
war, where I™m from, relatives, no relatives.  
He gave me  $20 in my pocket.  So I had $3 plus
 $20; I had $23. With $23, they says here™s  $20 
and you will sightsee. They want me  to go to 
the city, transportation 
because they put me  up 
with food so I didn™t need any food.  I went b
ack to the house and this
 lady, she packed my 
lunch.  She says, I™m a stranger in the city.  I wa
s afraid to venture too far out.  She says well 
you can go to the zoo. The zoo was nearby.  I coul
d walk over there,Adams-Morgan.  She gave 
me  the lunch so she says it™s a big zoo.  Big zoo, I™m
 afraid I mi ght be lost
 in the zoo.  So the 
first bench I approached I sat dow
n and I ate my lunch up.  I finished for the day. The next day 
I ventured out and I went to 14
th
 St reet. That time 14
th
 St reet was all white and you could walk.  
It wasn™t  like after________ before 
the riots.  I looked in differen
t stores.  I saw a cleaning store 
and I see some body reading a Jewish newspaper, 
I recognized it.  I says ma ybe  should go 
inside and ask him if he can find me  a job.  Bu
t I hesitated, I didn™t go in. The following day, 
don™t forget, I still ha d food, I went downtown.  I th
ink Lafayette Park or so
me place.  I just sat 
down and men were sitting there.  I struck up a 
conversation with him.  He asked me  where I™m 
from and everything.  I told him whe r e I come from
.  He says he™s  an ex-Navy ma n.  He was in 
the Seabees.  He says he lives on 14
th
 St reet with his wife.  He lives in the CavalierApartments 
on 14
th
 St reet.  I was still living far away like I to
ld you, near the zoo which is all in walking 
distance.  He says why don™t you come  and I wa nt
 my wife to meet you.  Okay, so  maybe the 
next day, I went and me t his 
wife.  He says you know we have
 to find you a room where you 
can stay.  I told him I don™t like where  I stay. 
We  could find you a job.  I think he gave me  
dinner and he said would you like to -- so he sa ys we find a job first.  Otherwise you wouldn™t 

be able to find a room.  How you go
ing to pay?   He asked me what I did.  I says I don™t know.  I 
worked for theAmerican army, he kitchens. They going to find you a job in People™s Dr ug 

St ore.  In the commissary at night. Are you fa
miliar withWa shington? 
They had counters with 
food and all this stuff.  He took me  to the Personn
el and they find a job.  So I work at night.  He 
says well, we  got to get you a room.  I didn™t like 
my job.  I didn™t like ay nights sleeping in the 
daytime, work at night.  I cannot meet nobody.  
I was working there ma ybe for a week or for 
two weeks. Then he says now we go into the People™s  Drug St ores, 14
th
 and Park Road was a 
drug store and they have notices, who rents for room
s.  Inside of a day, he saw a room for rent 
right around the corner where he 
lives. We  went over there and we talked to the ma n. They 
were refugees too. They were German Jewish re
fugees but they arrived there before the war.  
But they were still refugees.  He recognized my
 accent. Wh ere you from, from Poland?   I told 
him.  He says where do you work?  
 I says I just got a job at Pe opl
e™s overnight.  I don™t  like this 
job and the work at night.  He says you know
 what, he says.  I got a cousin; he™s got a 
restaurant.  Let me  call up; if he needs some body.  He calls him up and this cousin live around 

the neighborhood.  He was livingAr
kansasAvenue, in walking distance too.  He says I have a 
young ma n, he™s  from Poland, he works at night.  
Do you think you can use him?   He says bring 
him over.  He says, you work the same  evening. We  walk over the same  evening come  over, 

how you doing, like with wine. All ri
ght, a little bit of wine, Mani
schievez.  He says I have a 
place downtown nearThomas Circle.  He says come
 over there.  If you like it, you take the job.  
If you don™t like it, it™s  fine too.The next day I go
 over there.  It™s  a daytime job.  He says, so 
you spend a day, what do you have to lose. You™re off in the daytime, you work at night.  I 

stayed there and I says I like 
it.  He paid me  a dollar an hou
r, 40- hour week.  I took home  $36 
but I figured I have a room already.  I paid $40 
for my room, nice people, German people, nice 
and clean.  I have a room, I™m single so I don™t ha
ve to go out for food.  I have a daytime job.  I 
have my friend, a newly acquired friend, Mr. Brown. 
 Mr. Brown he was very nice.  Once in a 
while Sally went over there and she ate and 
she says you learn English.  How do you spoke, 
transportation. Ve ry nice people, 
interested in them. You ask 
about school.. I enrolled in 
Americanization school. TheAmer
icanization school was then on 18
th
 and Columbia Road on 

California St reet.  I went to school and then I 
make all -- people from Poland and some  from 
Lodz and some from di ff erent.  Some from boys, 
some ca me t o an uncle, some came to an aunt, 
some came j ust like me. That was in the evening.
  I had to be there seve
n o™clock.  I went there 
seven o™clock.  I learned about the poems Capt
ain my Captain. You recite poems  and s i ng.  
Don™t forget we™re all older people. Then I ma ke friends.  On the weekend I have where to go.  

I have already friends and I have a daytime job.  I ask them what do you do for a living.  One 

worked for an uncle, one worked in a tailor shop, 
one works here, one is giving a party. Then I 
met my wife because I didn™t.  I met some guy
, he says we™re going to have a party this 
weekend.  Could you come  along.  He took me  along 
and my wife, she came to her uncle. They 
were living off -- they had already a nice house.  
Uncle was in business. You know who lives in 

the house?   Fauntleroy. 
 

Q: Oh,really? 

 

A: The for mer delegate, well to do..  I had alrea
dy friends and then after 
Americanization School, I 
enrolled in Central High School and take
 --.  Right now, it™s Cardoza, it™s  13
th
 and 15
th
 St reets.  I 
took a few courses over there at night. Then I ha
d already dates with my wife and had parties 
and we picnic, theAmerican way. We  went to 
beaches and I still had my
 job. Then I had to 
register for the draft and then I got married. 
 

Q: When did you get ma rried? 

 

A: I got ma rried January 6, 1952.  I came in ™49.  I 
got ma rried in 1952.  Listen to that.  I came  
back from my honeymoon, I had greetings from Un
cle Sam to go to the army.  I says I just 
came from -- I don™t want to sound like a________.  
I want to go in the army but I just came 
from a ca mp  and all of a sudden, I got to go aw
ay.  I™m acquiring a fa mily now with a wife, 
with relatives.  I don™t have anybody, now I got 
to go away. All right 
but I have to go. The 
induction center I had to report on NewYorkAvenue
.  I go down there and 
the first time I must 
have been late.  Because we were living north
west and I di dn™t know the bus connections.  I 
was late and the bus left me __________. The clerk 
over there, it was a legitimate excuse, I was 
just late.   She says well you come  back next
 week.  She put it down on my paper. The next 
week I was there a little 
bit earlier.  I came back next week 
and we took us down toAlexandria.  
I think it™s Cameron (? ) St ation. You™re familia
r with it? We  went through the whole process 
tests and everything. Then we had to go for interv
iew.  I went for interview. The captain calls 
me  in because I couldn™t speak -- br oken English and probably didn™t ma ke out too good in my 

tests.  I didn™t  understand some  ques tions.  He 
find out that I was in Buchenwald.  He says, I 
liberated Buchenwald.  He says I™m going to 
give  you a postponeme nt for one year until you are 
a little more fa miliarized yourself with the count
ry. We  put you 4F now.  In one year, they 
called me  ba ck. At that time , I was already more
 organized and they called me  back.  I had to 

report to Ft. Meade.  I was drafte
d, I was two years.  I came in -- I 
went in as a private, I came  
out as a sergeant.  I took my
 basic training with the 101
st
Airborne in Kentucky and then I got 
assigned to Ft. Bragg, North Carolina which was 
good  for me because I was stationed there. 
 

Q: Wa sn™t  too far away? 

 

A: Wa sn™t  too far away and I was in charge of th
e mess hall because I knew it already the same  that 
you cook in baking school.  I came out top of the cl
ass.  I have all the best recommendations.  I 
show you later on after the interview is finished. 
 I let you read about it.  I came up top of the 
class. They gave me  a set of knives and everythi
ng. Then I got discharged from the service.  I 

was looking for a job so I got a j
ob from the Giant ma ybe for a year or two. Then I worked for 
my wife™s  Uncle Ben here, a liquor store. Then 
I went back to the guy, 
the restaurant who gave 
me  the first job.  Over there, I me t some body who 
is a salesman.  He says I know of a place but 
you know the work, he tells me  and I know who wants to sell it, so ma ybe you can take me  as a 
partner.  He says I™m going to draw less than you 
do because I have a job.  But I just  going to be 

-- I™m going to pull up the money just like you.  Bu
t you live in the house and 
I figure that that™s 
a terrific idea for me .  He know
s the place so I went to look at 
the pl ace.  I bought the place and 
now I™m already 19 years over there.  I™m going on 
20 years.  It™s a very ni ce place.  It™s the 
United St ates Secret Service is over there.
  I know everybody over there and I have a good 
business.  Now I™m ready to retire and don™t forg
et, I came  toAmerica with $3 I got in New 
York. That™s my story. 
 

Q: It™s  a very good story. 

 

A: Now I™ m going to go upstairs and I™m going 
to show you the letters of my recommendation, 
okay? 
 

Q: Okay.  Can I ask you a question before we stop? 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: I know you said you left your fa mily in the 
ghetto in Lodz.  Did you ever find out what 
happened to them?  
 

A: We ll, I tell you.  I didn™t find out.  I want to go 
back to Poland right after when I me nt ioned it 
because I was barely one year over. Then I got 
back to work for theAmerican army and this 
like this. Then the pogroms set in in Poland.  In
 Kielce when I was there.  I heard diff erent 
stories that the people who came back from the camp, who came back to the hometowns, and 

the Poles ma de sarcastic rema rk. So ma ny ofyou still survive!  I 
thought you all dead and 
things like that. Then as things became  kno
wn, when they liquidated 
the ghetto, the most of 
them went to Kelna and then they went to 
Auschwitz. Then I considered, I looked at the 
picture, my father was already 
40 years old.  He was born in 1900. 
 He was 44 years, it™s not old 
but the Germans done that and you don™t have mu
ch food to eat, you look like an old ma n.  My 
mother, one year younger. Then I had a younger brot
her.  He was at that time, he was born in 
1929 so that ma kes him in 1945, 12, 13, so it™s a very
 slim chance to survive.  But I did, I was 
writing letters to friends because I know I had some
 friends. As a ma tter of fact, right after the 
war I came in contact with some  people from Fra n
ce. They were in the French army but they 
were touched in Nuremb erg.  Some how I got to k
now them. They tried to help but I didn™t get 
any response.  I wrote to the French governme nt, 
to different organizations
 and -- but then after 
right now with the Clarks_________affair and -- thi
ngs like this, I obtaine
d a letter from the 
Clarks_________and I notice that my aunt was on 
the transport on the list.  I have the list 
upstairs too so it™s a very slim ch
ance to survive.  I didn™t hear a
nything.  Besides I registered in 
Jerusalem and I registered in Germany. They have
 all my records from t he date of inception.  I 
figured if a younger brother is l
ooking for me , he could find me  easily so I never knew.  I 
wondered many times but --. 
 

Q: Did you ever think about going to Israel? 

 

A: I wanted to go to --. America was the last  
thing on my mi nd because I didn™t think of going to 

America in the first few couple of years after th
e war, onlyAmerica had the strict quota. They 
took in people who were sponsored by some body w
ho guaranteed the highest, highest, highest.  
But then somehow, I thinkTr uman, they passed a 
law, Congress passed a law, they got to admit 
200 or 250 thousand refugees.  I wasn™t  the first one 
to believe in it so my friend, he is the first 
one who entered Munch.  But he brought me  back
 to prove that he regi
stered, he didn™t have 
anybody.  I went after that too.  From that tim
e, I knew I™m going to have it easy because I 
didn™t engage in smuggling, black markets.  I ha
d a legitimate job and all the recommendations 
so I know if that™s the date, I be comi ng here. That™s my story. 
 
Q: Okay, I think we™re done if you want
 to say anything else before --. 
 

A: I was just saying --. Wh at I wa
nt to say, now things are differ
ently. At that time  in 1944, if 
people could help one another but they didn™t.  
A lot of people kept silent.  I wouldn™t condemn 
the whole race or the whole nati
on but a lot of people could™ve survived. The populations was 
very hostile in Europe, in Easter
n Europe especially.  InWe stern 
Europe it was a different story 
but in Eastern Europe, the Jews 
were always second-class citizens.
  Even right now, I™m reading 
the stories like after cleaning of theWa rsaw ghetto, they brought 
the people fromAuschwitz to 
clean theWarsaw ghetto. When the Poles made a 
revolt, they freed some of the inmates. The 

revolt didn™t last long but just fo
r six weeks or so. They freed some  of the inma tes, they 
cleaning theWa rsaw ghetto. They said we want 
to free Poland with our Jews.  Some  of them 

got killed after the war so that what it is. That™s  ma n inhuma nity to ma n.  Right now if you see 

some thing wrong, you stand up and get to be counte
d. That™s exactly what it means -- ma n™s 
inhumanity to ma n.  It™s an old poem, I don™t kno
w if you read.  It™s not a poem, it was in the 
paper. A German priest writes.  He sa ys when Hitler came into power in 1933, he said, they 

start persecuting the Jews .  He says, I wasn™t  
a Jew, I didn™t spoke up. Then they take the 
homosexuals put them in concentration camp -- I don™t know if you™re familiar with it -- I 
wasn™t  a homosexual, I didn™t speak up. Then they
 took the clergy, the Pr
otestants, I wasn™t  a 
Protestant, I didn™t spoke up.  It came to the Cath
olic, I wasn™t  a Catholic, I didn™t spoke up.  It 
came to me , there was nobody else to
 speak up for me . That™s the 
way it is. That™s  what it is. 
 
Q: Thankyou. 

 

A: Okay, thank you.  I don™t know how I™m going to sound. 

 

Q: Nope, sounds good. 

 

A: Let me  see.  I™m going to show you what I have upstairs. 

 

Q: Good,good.
