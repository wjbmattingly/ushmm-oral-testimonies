Switzerland, Germany, a nd Austria.  
Q: Was -- was this a family business?  Or -- 

A: Well, n-no, it wasn™t  a fa mil -- but it was like 
a fa mily. See, they were all together  all the 
time, and so they used to come  and visit us. No
w, that™s why my father wanted me  to learn 
German, bec a use at that time  
we were friends with the Germans, when I was young. And I had 
always a -- a governess, she was from Austria,
 and she was Jewish. And -- so I knew German, 
because see, when you™re young, you learn fast. 

Q: Right. 

A: But then I -- I didn™t --
 I didn™t speak any more. 
Q: You didn™t. 

A: But I remember when she used to take me
 to school, she used to behave like a German. 
Q: Can you explain? 
A: She was Jewish, but she -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and she did -- my father didn™t want us to ta
ke a -- a -- the chauffeur with us to take us to 
school, she want us to walk. And so -- but she wa
nted to walk like a German, and sing. Dast ist, 
the lieblin -- and you know wor -- the Greeks used
 to go all the way, and some  of the m, they 
wanted to make fun, you know, that that™s how we
 were walking like this
. But what I could do?  
She was my teacher and I used to do what she 
wanted me  to do. But when we decided after a 
couple of years that we didn™t -- di
dn™t want her to stay any more. 
Q: Uh-huh.

A: Very mu ch. 

Q: Yes? 

A: And until now, she™s un -- 
he is my favorite person. 
Q: Really?  So tell me  what he was like for you. 

A: He was a -- well, what can I say, he -- he wa
s always very nice, and -- and I did sometimes 
wrong things. I reme mb er one day he wanted to 
punish me , and he wanted to hit me . He never 
did that, but -- so I started r
unning around the table, and finally 
he started laughing. And that was 
it. 
Q: And that was it. 
A: And that was the only time that he tried to 
-- he was ma d, I  don™t know what I was saying. So 
-- and he was the only ma n that I used to longagee when we would go out, some  -- some  place, 

you know. My ex-husband didn™t like that. 

Q: You me a n, you would hold on -- 

A: Longagee, yes. 

Q: You would hold onto his -- yes? 

A: And he looked so young, and when my friends 
would see me , we -- they -- they a -- would 
ask me , is a -- are you engaged?  And all 
my friends were -- they loved him.  
Q: Yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486

A: Yes. 
Q: So he was a warm pe rson? 

A: [tape flaw] gorgeous. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The picture doesn™t do much to him, really. 

Q: I™m sorry Joan, we just ha
d a battery going dead over here. 
Q: Okay, we have to stop the tape. 

Q: Sorry about that. Go ahead. 

Q: You were just saying some thing that all your fr
iends were in love with your father, he was so 
gorgeous. Did he talk to you a lot? 

A: Mm- mm -- no, I don™t reme mber, b
ecause he was always very busy -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and traveling. He used to travel to otherparts of Europe, as a Zionist, you know, he wanted 
to meet people. And then he used to go to Is
rael every year. And he 
would buy [indecipherable] 
and homes from there, Palestine -- Palestine. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because he thought that one da
y the -- the Jews would go there.
 And it was nothing at that 
time, Israel, nothing. There were no trees, nobody want
ed to live there, and that™s why the Arabs 
were selling it, everything.  

Q: So he was a Zionist? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Very early.  

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486

Q: As far as you know. 
A: But he was a zion -- he was a very Jew, but he 
kept it on his ha -- he 
didn™t show it to the --  
the Greeks. With the Greeks he be
 -- behaved like them, you know. 
Q: Uh-huh, so he -- was he really assi
milated, or was he just showing that? 
A: No, he was a modernist, he wanted, you know, 
to -- to act a way that
 we will -- they will 
know us, they will love  us , you know?  And by talking their language, by -- for instance, when 

the -- the holidays, they used to invite us, you 
know, and when they used to have the Pa sha, 
which is the Greek Easter, and they had all kinds
 of, and that we -- we 
were eating Passover, you 
know, things. And I used to ask my father what 
shall I do there, I cannot 
eat bread, and I -- said, 
yes, you™re going to eat everythi ng they™ll give 
you, that™s okay. And when we will come  home, 
we™ll do that. And -- and the archbi
shop used to come  to our house 
when they had -- at that time 
they used to fast, and -- and we 
used to give him things from Pesach, and he would eat. And he -- 
my father used to sa
y, if the archbishop -- 
Q: Can eat? 
A: -- can, we  can eat too. So he was that type, 
you know, he wanted to -- and we had -- most of 
our friends were Greeks, not Jewish
. But inside of hi m, he wa s a -- a Jew, with all his heart, you 
know. We  learn -- learne
d -- I learned Hebrew. 
Q: You did? 

A: And at that time , only boys used to go to He
brew school. I was the onl
y girl there, because 
my father said that he wanted me  to be 
like anybody else, you know, 
not different. And so I 
became Bat mitzvah™ed seven years ago. 

Q: Really?  Se ven y
ears ago?  Do you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486

A: And I thought I had forgotten, but all of a sudd
en I reme mber. I became the best student in the 
class. 
Q: But you™re very good at languages, aren™t you? 

A: We ll, I used to be, but you know, 
when you don™t use them, it™s bad. And -- 
Q: So, y-you had a very promi -- you were in a ve
ry prominent family, yes?  Cause your -- your 
home  was huge, yes?  Ha -- do you reme mber how
 ma ny rooms?  Could you even count them? 
A: I don™t, but it was so big that my -- I used to
 run all the way through one room to another, and 
my brother used to ma ke fun of me
. Said, ﬁI will give you a bicycle.ﬂ  
Q: And I™m sure it was big enough, you could ha
ve ridden a bicycle in these rooms, yes? 
A: He was kidding. 

Q: And you had a huge garden. We  have some  -- 

A: And -- and two storey -- 

Q: Two stories. 
A: -- and -- and downst -- be
low, we had how you call -- 
Q: A base -- in the baseme nt?  
A: Baseme nt. And we had like ping pong table, and ot
her things that to -- 
could play, downstairs. 
And next we™ll open the door downstairs, and 
it was -- how you call in Engli -- sometimes the 
other word doesn™t come . Not sea, water, you know. 

Q: Like a lake? 

A: Lake. We had that lake right there, front yard. 

Q: In your yar -- you had a lake?   

A: We  open the door --

A: -- and ther e was the la

Q: Could you swim in that lake, or 
you took the boat, or
 you just looked? 
A: No, no, no, I just looked. 
Q: I see. 

A: And it was always clean, always nice. 

Q: Were there fishes? 

A: I don™t reme mber seeing. 

Q: No. 

A: No.  

Q: Did you feel very -- 

A: I didn™t sta -- I didn™t go out
 of the house too much. See, 
that™s the bad thing about. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, because they ke pt me  too -- I-I was ho
me  most of the -- you know, with this -- with a 
governess, or with friends. The friend
s, they had to be at my house.  
Q: Not you at theirs? 

A: Not me  -- no. 

Q: Do you know why?  

A: Well, tha- that  was -- my father was like that , a
nd he had other things th
at I didn™t like at the 
time. For instance, when he would come  home, he
 didn™t want to hear Spanish He used to say 
they threw us out, they didn™t want us, why s
hould we speak their language?  No Spanish. And so 
you can talk any other language you want, it™s fine
. And when we™ll get ou
t of the house, it™s 
only Greek.  

Q: Had you learned Spanish? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
9 
 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yes.  

Q: And he could speak it, I™m sure, yes -- 

A: Oh sure. 

Q: -- but he didn™t want to hear
 it in the house. Tell me  -- tell -- I™m going to go back to your 
father, but tell me a little bit about your mother
. W- Wi -- you™re not as close to your mother as 
your father, or am I wrong? 

A: No, I wasn™t as close to my mother 
as my father, no. She was very nice, though. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And well, although she was born while the Turk
s were in Greece, she didn™t like the Turks, 
and her fami ly also didn™t care about. And the 
Turks were so good to them. You know, when 
they -- they would go and si -- because the -- ma 
-- his -- her relatives were at that time to be 
doctors, or -- 

Q: Lawyers? 

A: Lawyers, some thing, you know. They were tr
eating them a s , you know, kings, they would go 
down like that, you know? 

Q: So they were professional people? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The Turks. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
10 
 
A: And so -- and -- but she didn™t want to spea
k Turk -- in Turkish, never spoke. She went to 
Greek school, and she knew Greek better than
 I did. Yeah. And she 
thought that nobody is 
perfect, nobody knows all the words 
that they™re -- and she used to, on Saturdays when she 
didn™t do s -- any work, she used 
to take there -- sh -- she had 
to learn new words. You know, she 
used to take the vocabulary, and learn it. And sh
e used to say, if some
body thinks that he knows 
all the words or everything, you know, she™s stup
id, or she™s ignorant, you know, because we 
have a -- a -- 

Q: Your brother Haim is two years younger, or -- 

A: Two years older -- 

Q: Two -- two years older than -- 

A: -- two -- two -- two and a 
half years [indecipherable]

you all eat together? Lunch, and -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- breakfast, lunch and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- dinner? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Or dinner and supper, I don™t know the --  

A: Yes, we used to eat all toge ther , ye s. 

Q: And did you have a lot of conversations
 at dinner, or was it a quiet dinner? 
A: No, we used to have conversations. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
11 
 
Q: And wha t  -- was politics a big part of -- 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Not polit -- no.  

Q: So -- 

A: At that time  we didn™
t discuss politics at all. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was usually religion, or how
 things are in school, and -- yeah. 
Q: And you, and your -- 

A: And probably my father and my
 mother used to discuss politic
s because my mother was very 
involved in it. 

Q: She was? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: In Zionism, or in -- 
A: No, not in Zionism, she wasn™t involved as my father. 

Q: Uh-huh. So what sort of politics was she involved in? 

A: Greek politics, or what they thought about
 the Jews, and the -- and other countries, you know. 
Yeah, and she used to be a philanthropist, which 
my father also was. But my mother, what she 
used to do is she knew several people that they we
re very proud, they didn
™t want to ask anything 
from anybody, and she used to take me  with he
r ma ny ti me s, we used to go and give them 
some thing, and -- wrapped up or something, you know, 
and so that™s what we used to do when I 
was home , because I was at school also -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
12 
 
A: -- for six years. 
Q: Right. Wha -- at what age did you go to boarding school? 

A: I went -- I was 11 and a half.  

Q: 11 and a half. Did they have a good relationship? 

A: With theschool? 

Q: No, your father and mother, from what you reme mber. 

A: Oh, yes. 

Q: It was a -- it was a good relationship? 

A: Yes, but see, there we re al
ways wome n that they were inte
rested to him -- at him,  you know. 
But no, he was good to my mother. 

Q: Right. And was she jealous of these wome n, you think? 

A: No, I don™t think so, because I thought th
at the -- she di dn™t care about that, you know. 
Q: Did -- she didn™t work? 
A: No. 
Q: No, she didn™t work. Was she an educated woma n?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: She was. 

A: But mostly on her own. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She did the -- the -- the most education. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. She learned by herself French. My
 father learned by her -- by hims elf Greek. 

Q: No kidding. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
13 
 
A: And he knew better than I did. He  used to read 
the paper, and -- and -- 
cause the paper is very 
hard to understand some time s. 
Q: Right. 

A: And -- yeah. They le 
--  the-they learned. 
Q: So was he -- was he not born in Gr eece? 

A: He was born in Saloni ka. Wa s Gr eece -- it was Turkis -- 

Q: Is gr -- it was Turkistan -- 

A: -- that  time. 

Q: -- that™s right, yes, I see, 
okay. And tell me  about Haim. The 
two of yo -- a brother who™s two 
and a half years older -- 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- were you -- were you close when you 
were growing up, or was that difficult? 
A: We ll, see th -- my parents, because I was al
ways sweet and nice, you know, they used to hug 
me  all the time , and kiss me , and this and that. And 
he -- didn™t appear that he wanted this, see, 
but he did wa nt probabl y, he was jealous. Because  when -- there were times that he used to hit 

me .  

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, but from -- when I was in -- in the hous
e. When I was away, he used to write me  such 
wonderful letters, 
as if I was a saint, you know?  Yeah. 
Q: So how did you put this t -- 

A: And how my s -- 

Q: You don™t know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
14 
 
A: He used to tell me  how much he loved me , 
and if one day he was going to be a big person, 
would be because of me . 
Q: Really? 

A: So -- but he was very intelligent. His teacher
 used to tell my parents, why you are -- why you 
are against him?  You know, he™s -- ma ybe he do
esn™t ma ke the -- the good grades, but he knows 

more than I do, the teacher 
used to say. You know, he -- 
he was very intelligent. 
Q: So were your parents hard on him in some  wa y? 

A: Yes, because he wasn™t ma king good grades, and they want him to -- 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: -- to do better. And so that™s it. 
It™s always something in the homes. 
Q: In the home s always. Always complicated, isn™t it? 

A: Yeah, right. And he had no reason to be jeal
ous of me . And my mother
 used to say, if you -- 
y-you are so good, so wonderful pe
rson, and she didn™t have that 
tone, that y -- you know, like a 
-- getting a da -- how can 
I say?  Some ti me s I can™t think of the words. 
Q: Wa s -- was he aggressive? 

A: Some times, at me , you know. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Say we would love you more than anythi
ng in the world, you know?  And I would believe 
that, because he had too ma ny good i deas, too ma ny 
good things. But he used to u -- lose his 
temper sometimes, you know. 

Q: His temp er, uh-huh. Was it easi -- do you think it 
was easier for him when you were away at 
school?  Or was he away at school too? 

A: Probably, probably it was. Probabl
y he was perfect at the time --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
15 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: See they -- they tried to send him 
at school, so he 
won™t be with me. 
Q: I see. 

A: You know?  And keep me  at home. 
But he used to leave the school. 
Q: He would leave the school? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And come home so he could be with you. 

A: So they decide to send me  instead. 

Q: Right, right. And what sort of school was this? 

A: It was a Greek school, but we had French, 
and Latin, Ancient Greek. And we had to work 
very hard. 

Q: Did you like it? 

A: I liked it, but we had to work hard. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It was mainly working, you know. 

Q: Wa s this difficult for you to be away from 
the house, because you had been so much in the 
house?  

A: I know, it -- it was difficult, especially 
at the beginning, you know. I always mi ss them. I 
always mi ss them. But I thought they were doing th
e best for me . I always thought so. I never put 
in my mi nd thatthey were 
doing the wrong thing, never. 
Q: So you wouldn™t cr
iticize them, no. 
A: No, never. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
16 
 
Q: Did it help you to become  a little bit mo
re independent because you were away?  Was it 
helpful?  
A: N -- no, see there -- they followed the Swiss 
mentality, that we -- they had to keep the 
children, you know, mor e  in -- in 
schools, ma ybe, in boarding school
s, things like 
that. And str -- 
strange with it -- I mean being -- not being soft. 
See, I used to get in my window in -- in Drama 
and look outside. And I used to see boys or gi
rls, you know, with no shoes because they were 
poor, walking in the rain. And I used to be to -- en
vy them that they were free, and I didn™t have 
that freedom. 

Q: And you didn™t have it. Even thou
gh you knew they were probably poor. 
A: Right. 

Q: But they were free. 

A: But I -- I didn™t know what poor
 was, or anything, you know. And see, the thing with me  is I 
used to read also Russian, la 
-- you know, when -- the fall of the communist, those Russian. And 
they didn™t have a good -- they didn™t talk well
 about their -- the poor, they thought they were 
peasants. They didn™t have ma nners, they didn™t
 have anything. They [indecipherable]. And I 
started thinking like them, and 
now when I think of myself, 
I ™ m -- I™m -- you know, I feel bad 
about it, because if we didn™t have
 that -- all these peopl
e, that they work so hard, a-and they 
were good, and everything, you know, we woul dn™t have
 the things that we have today. It™s 
because of them that we live better. And onl
y when I came here, and I was living the way I 

wanted to live, you know, but I started thin
king, poor -- poor people, you know, working on the 
streets with this heat, and every -- how they
 can ma nage?  And what I™m doing?  Nothing, in 
comparison with them. You know?  And I started feeling differ
ent about people. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
17 
 
A: I didn™t know them wh
-while I was at home. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I di -- I knew only their friends, you know, and -- 

Q: And the children of those friends. 

A: Yes, right. 

Q: So it was a very small soci
ety that you were a part of. 
A: Right, because I wasn™t
 free to go outside -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and meet with other people. 

Q: And whe n you went to school, were this -- a mixt
ure of people, or again it was a very rich -- 
fr om -- fr om prominent families of which -- 

A: From prominent fa mi lies. 

Q: Uh-huh. So you lived in -- 
A: But they -- they were -- in school there we
re some  Jewish people, but in boarding school, 
especially the first years I was all 
alone. I was the only Jewish girl. 
Q: The only Jewish -- and what di
d that mean? Was -- was it -- 
A: But they treated 
very well, you know. 
Q: They did? 

A: Oh yes. And their -- the one that owned th
e school, I mean, I was her favorite, she just loved 
me . And everybody in the school, they never showed any anti-Semitism t here. 

Q: So you never experienced anti-Semitism as a kid?  

A: No. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
18 
 
A: Only one day in the -- going back at home with
 the train. I was sit -- there were some  people 
sitting with me , and they were talking about th
e Jews. And of course, not good things. And -- and 
I only was listening, and I didn™t sa
y anything. And then finally one of them said to me, ﬁWell, 
we don™t hear anything from you,you know, what do you think about
 the Jews?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ I said, 
ﬁyou™re looking to one of them.ﬂ And they became all red, you know, and said, ﬁBut you™re 
better than we are.ﬂ See, they were fr om villa -- 
not villages, places where they didn™t have any -
- they -- they knew nothing about Jews. Whatever 
their church will tell them, that we killed 

Jesus, and we  -- they didn™t even know that Jesus was a Jew, you know. 

Q: Right. 

A: So. 

Q: We ™re going to st -- stop a
nd change the tape right now. 
A: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Before -- before we get back to the story, I 
just wanted you to ma ke clear, when you talked 
about Spanish, you really were talking about Ladino, am I correct? 

A: I found out th-the language here, they -- they 
said Ladino, in -- in the United States. In -- in 
Europe my father used to say the Spanish that they
 used to speak at that time in -- when -- when 
we -- the Jews left -- 

Q: Left in the 15
th
 century. 
A: Yeah, yeah, right. 

Q: Yes. Now, you had particular interests, w
ho -- and one of them -- I™m going to ask you about 

other ones, but you were interested in design, I 
understand, fa shion. And you were, as a little girl, 
di -- 

A: You know -- 

Q: So tell me  what you did, your -- you ha -- so
me body ca me  in and they were ma king clothes 
for you, is that right? 

A: Yeah, and a -- how to call it, a seamstress? 

Q: A seamst ress, yes. 

A: And if I didn™t like what she ma de, I would ex
 -- tell her, do you think this way will be better, 
or this way. You know, can you ch
ange it a little bit?  And so
me ti me s she would undo the whole 
thing, and do it -- so, and that™s how my father 
thought that probably I have
 the -- th-this what I 
would like to be when I grow up, be a designer.  

Q: Wa -- was he right, 
would you have liked that? 
A: I don™t know, because see, after th
e liberation, things were so --  
Q: We re so different. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
20 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But you -- 

A: I don™t know, and then I was so involved 
with the -- the children, and everything -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- here see. I never did the 
-- and -- this jobs before, you know. 
Q: Right. 

A: So I had to learn from the beginning how 
to do a -- everything. And it was little bit difficult 
on me . And so -- and I -- I was afra
id at the time, although that I ha
d my driver™s license, I didn™t 
drive, I was afraid. And I - I spent al l my time in
 the -- in the house. And -- and I liked to do 
everything from st -- scratch, you know, 
the food, everything, I didn™t use -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- so I spent all the day lik
e this. And then I c
ouldn™t wait for my children to come , and hug 
them, kiss them, talk, things what they did and everything. But unfortunately my wors t enemy 
was the television at  the time. Now, I like it, because otherwise I feel very lonely. But that  time, 
I-I need to ha ve a conversation with them, and th
e only time  that I -- I wouldn™t let them watch 
televi sion is when we will sit at th
e table, then I™ll turn it off. 
And that way we had a little time to 
discuss something.  

Q: Right. 

A: As soon as we™ll get out of the table,
 they™ll all [indeciphe
rable] television. 
Q: They were watching television. 

A: Yeah. And that was a difficult part.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486

Q: So -- so when you were growing up, what ot
her interests did you have? Did -- were there 
particular interests in school, that
 you liked one subject better than
 another, or did -- did you just 
like everything? 
A: We ll see, I had one year in -- 
I went at the university in Athe
ns. And then we had to h-hide, 
you know, I couldn™t continue. 

Q: Right. 

A: And here I thought that ma ybe I can become  
a -- well see, a -- oh, what was this place?  The 
F r e n c h  - - s o me t i me s  my  mi
nd stops, I can™t think.  
Q: You™re thinking of a place? 

A: Oh, it™s -- 

Q: Or some  [indecipherable] 

A: It™s some where where they teach French. 
The school a -- scho -- the Berlitz school of 

languages. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
A: I went there, and -- and I-I had very 
good time there, teaching, you know, Greek. And I 

became friends with some people who lived in Rive
r rocks at that time . Ri
ver rocks was against -

- they didn™t want any Jews around, and she beca
me  such a good friend with me , she went to 
Greece, she wrote me  letters from there, and so I-
I was very interest ed. And see, that ™s when I 
think what my father thought, you know. The only time 
that we can be friends with each other is 

by knowing each other. See, otherwise -- say this
 woma n ha-had no idea about the Jews, see? 
Q: Right. 

A: And we came such good friends. 

Q: So were -- were you observant as Jews
 in the house, and you went to synagogue? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
22 
 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. 
Q: And -- you did, yes. 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: It was just that this was a very private -- 

A: No, the thing is that we™d -- we didn™t say th
at we weren™t Jews, they
 knew we we re Jews.  
Q: People knew, right. 

A: But we didn™t try to -- we tr
ied to connect with each other. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know what I me an? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Not too Jewish, ya -- not, 
you know. Tried to be modern. 
Q: Yes, yes, I know, to other people. 

A: You know, yeah. And modern. [ind
ecipherable]. We  can™t be now -- li
ve like they used to live 
3,000 years ago. 

Q: Right, right. And did you discu
ss religion with your friends as you 
got a little bit older, or was 
that not a subject that
 people talked about? 
A: We ll, I don™t know if my fa
ther discuss any. I-I didn™t. 
Q: You didn™t? 

A: No. 

Q: So the kids wouldn™t say, so 
what do Jews believe, or -- 

A: No. 

Q: No-Nothing. 

A: No. I didn™t ask them, 
they didn™t ask me .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
23 
 
Q: Right. 
A: But they knew I was Jewish. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Did you see -- 

A: I never intended to do that, because I 
was proud, I always was proud being a Jew. 
Q: Right. Did you go to synagogue? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yes, you did, on holidays, or did -- 

A: Of course, and I becam
e Bat Mitzvah, I told you. 
Q: But that™s recent. 

A: Yes, it is. 

Q: Yes, right. 

A: And I used to go before, but 
the pronunciation of the Hebrew wa
s different, and I thought that 
I -- I had forgotten. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 
A: And then the pronunciation changed, and -- 

Q: And was this an Orthodox 
synagogue that you went to? 
A: Beth Usurum was no, not Orthodo
x, was -- what™s next to Orthodox? 
Q: Conservative. 

A: Conservative. And now I belong to a Refor m. 

Q: So you™ve moved?  

A: And a -- yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I think that™s what 
I am, that™s how I feel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
24 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: You know? 

Q: Right. 

A: But inside of me  I™m very Jewish, very relig
ious. I feel like a -- th
e -- only our religion has 
meaning, you know?  And you hear th
e others, I mean, I just -- 
Q: We  got sirens. 

A: Silence? 

Q: The -- the si -- you can hear them?  

Q: Yeah. Go ahead. 

Q: Okay, and -- 

A: And because of us we have the 10 commandme
nts, which are the -- the laws. I mean, we did 
that, and people should be thankful to us for 
ma ny things. And the Greeks, that poem, he is 
thankful because we don™t have any more the 
-- so ma ny go -- gods, you know, that they believe 
in, and the -- the Roma ns  too, the same. So it™s 
more believable, what do we believe, you know, 
it™s one God, perfect God, you know. 

Q: You didn™t go hiking in the m
ountains, or skiing, or did you? 
A: No. 

Q: Isn™t there a mountain near you 
called Falakro mountain, in Drama? 

A: Falakro?  Falakro? 

Q: F-a-l-a-k-r-o. No? 
Maybe that™s later. 
A: Doesn™t sound --  

Q: So did you -- when you -- did you go outside 
with the fami l y and go on picnics, or -- 
A: Oh, oh, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
25 
 
Q: Yes, you did. 
A: Picnics. As a ma tter of fact 
-- Rinette didn™t bring that picture.
 It was a beautiful picnic. I™m 
sorry she didn™t. And it was going to Sofia. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Well anyway, we went to the th
eater, went to all kinds of -- 
Q: But this is as a family? 

A: Yeah, with the family. 

Q: You™re not going alone anywhere? 

A: No, no. 

Q: No. Did you ever say anythi
ng to your father or mother? 
A: No. 

Q: No, you didn™t. This was how you were 
raised, and this wa s the way it was. 
A: Right. I thought always they we
re doing the right thing for us. 
Q: Right. When Hitler takes over in Germany, wh
en the Nazis take over, in 1933, do people get 
worried?  Does your fami ly get worried?  Do you feel it?  I mean you were --  
A: Not a -- not as worried as we should. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because m- my parents had friends that were 
Germans, and they used to come  at our house, 
and that™s why they wanted me  to learn German. 

Q: Right. 

A: And -- but they were different at that tim
e, before Hitler ruined them. And -- and the 
Austrians we re very nice. So their – one more  
country, I can™t think th
e name  now. Switzerland. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
26 
 
A: Switzerland. At that time  we 
-- we lived in it, my parents 
open an account, and they supposed 
to have total -- 
Q: They open an account in Switzerland? 

A: In Switzerland, but we didn™t 
-- none of us was to know.  
Q: I see. 

A: It was secret. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Just the -- their name . My 
uncle™s name  and his name . In -- 
in -- and consequently I couldn™t 
go and take the money out, because
 my name was -- and they kept
 secret there. This was a -- 
they had a wa y. So -- but I don™t think that mone
y was lost, I tell you why. My uncle survived, 
his brother, and they ha
d the money together -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- and probably he got it. He didn™t say anythi
ng to me . I went to Swit
zerland my self to get it, 
and a friend of my father sai
d, don™t do anything because there w
ill be more anti-Semitism. So I 
left it. But I have an idea that my uncle probably 
did it. And he didn™t take it for his own benefit, 
he was a wonderf -- a very good ma n, you know. He di
d it to help the rest 
of the relatives, the 
ones that were suffering more. You know what I mean?  

Q: Right, right. 

A: And that™s why I don™t keep any -- 

Q: A grudge? 

A: Grudge. 

Q: No grudge. 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
27 
 
Q: Yes. So were your pa rents putting money there because you -- they thought that maybe they 
would try to leave? 

A: They -- my father had this -- yeah, wa -- can™t keep money in one -- 

Q: All in one place, anyway.  

A: -- one place, yeah. We buy houses, we put in 
certain bank. We  lost all the money in Greece 
because ba -- became nothing, you know, after the war. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So -- and he put it in diffe
rent places. So -- but I don™t ca
re. I never cared about -- about 
money, as long as I -- I ca
n be independent, you know?   
Q: Right, right. 

A: I -- I don™t care. I don™t care about. Because 
I -- I feel -- I always 
felt like they had more 
problems, the -- wh-who --  

Q: The people who had a lot of mone y? 
A: A lot of money. And -- and they 
were a lot ha rder. So anyway -- 
Q: So -- and the Nazis take over, there™s -- ther
e™s not -- you™re not feeling tension in ™33 - ™34 - 
™35 - ™36. You™re going to school, you™re in Sa
lonika, Thalonika, ri
ght, and going to school. 
A: Salonika. 

Q: Is it Salonika or Thalonika? 

A: It™s Thessaloniki  in Greece. 

Q: Thessaloniki. 

A: In Greece. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And Salonika everybody else. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
28 
 
Q: Else, right. In 1936, Metaxas be
come s prime mi nister and he™s --
 likes fascism. He  likes the 
Germans, he  likes -- 
A: To tell you the truth, I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. So you think perhaps it didn™t have any impact on you in 1936?  You™re 

still in school -- 

A: On me, no. 

Q: No, nothing. 

A: No, nothing. 

Q: And you™re hearing nothing from your fa mily? 

A: No. 

Q: Are you reading the newspapers? 

A: I didn™t read th-the news
papers where I was in -- 
Q: In school? 
A: -- the boarding school. 
Q: Did you read it when you were home?  

A: Yes, and I read a lot of books. I di -- 

Q: And wha t  were -- what were you reading? 

A: I was reading French, Russian before
 then, communis m, a nd [indecipherable] 
Q: So who did you read in Ru
ssian?  Tolstoy?  Dostoyevsky? 
A: Dostoyevsky. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: And wha t ™s the other one?  
I can™t think the name  now. 
Q: Did you read Babel?  Maybe it wa
sn™t published then. Not Tolstoy? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
29 
 
A: No, I don™t think I 
read th -- Tolstoy. 
Q: And who did you read in French? 
A: Oh, it™s a -- so my -- my -- still 
in my home  is full of French books. 
Q: French books, yes? 

A: But my mi nd now, I have to think too much. 

Q: Okay then -- then we won™t as
k. Maybe it™ll come  [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, yeah. I have le -- ﬁLes
 Miserables,ﬂ by Victor Hugo. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I read it twice. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It still is in my house. And -- and I still want 
to read it again, I lo -- loved it. And I think we 
haven™t change. 

Q: No, unfortunately, I think you™re right. Did you like movies? 
A: Yes, but not the -- the ones now, 
I can™t stand them, the majority. 
Q: No, but when you were a child, when you were young, in Greece? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Did you see American movies also? 

A: Oh yes, sure. 

Q: Yeah, did you like them?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah? American mo vies 
went everywhere, I guess. 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: But Greek -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
30 
 
A: But we thought that all Americans were -- 
Q: Cowboys ? 

A: Cowboys . 

Q: I knew you were going to say that, yes. We ll, what can I tell you? 

A: And Rinette didn™t show you a pi
cture of mi ne when I came in. 
Q: No, we™ll see it later. 

A: Yeah, I have a -- 

Q: You have a cowboy hat, yes? 

A: -- I™m dr essed like [indecipherable]
. We ll, there are three of us, you know. 
Q: Cow -- a cow -- well, you moved to cowboy country. 

A: Yes, right. But you don™t see any more that. 

Q: No, no. Did -- did you have any boyfri
ends when you were in boarding school? 
A: No. 
Q: No. This was no -- was this all girls? 
A: All girls. 

Q: It was all girls. 

A: I never had boyfriends. And when I did, I was with the family. 

Q: What do you mean it was with
 the fa mily?  [indecipherable] 
A: When I -- I would dance -- when I would dan
ce with a boy, you know, the family was there.  
Q: Uh-huh, so it was always chaperoned in some respect. You look a little funny with that. You 

don™t think that was such a good idea? 

A: We ll, in that time , it was a good idea. 

Q: Right, right. Who dec i des to move to Athens? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
31 
 
A: We ll, they both decided. 
Q: They both decided. 

A: I tell you what, we had [indecipherable] friend
s and I -- and they thought that the Ge rmans 
were comi ng. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- 

Q: So they thought you should leave? 

A: We  should leave and we left everything, all the 
furniture, everything, just 
a -- our clothes, and 
we left. 

Q: We ll, let me  ask you some thing before, cause 
that™s really very important. Wh- When you and 
your fa mily are in Drama, your father is close to
 the king. Am I right, or
 at least he knows -- 
A: [indecipherable] the ki ng was comi
ng to town with his [inaudible] 
Q: That was -- okay -- 
A: My voice. 
Q: It™s okay, is it all right?  Be
cause I -- it™s going to start wi
th me , too. The  if the king would 
come  to town, to Drama, your father would see h
im, yes?  And -- am I right that you tell me  when 
he wanted to call his wife he would come  to
 your house, because he 
could be private, and 
nobody would be listening. So your -- your family 
was not only wealthy and -- and prominent in 
terms of being wealthy, but they were very we
ll connected in terms of pe ople who knew what 
was going on in the world. So, in a sense t -- your
 father was warned, ma ybe it would be just 
better to leave. 

A: Well now, I tell you that our 
friends were all Christians. 
Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
32 
 
A: That they were the -- they used to say co
me any time during the day, the night, any time that 
you feel some one saw you, and you are in danger -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- our house is open for you. And that™s what we
 did, especially my brother because he used 
to go. Couldn™t stand mu ch at home. And -- 

Q: Now wer e  these people in Athens who said th
at, or people all over Gr
eece who said that to 
you? 

A: Well, over Greece -- 

Q: And ma ybe outside? 

A: We ll, no, they didn™t know yet. 

Q: Right. 

A: In Drama  they didn™t know.  

Q: Yes.  
A: But in Athens there were a lot of our friends
 from that -- that they m -- they had mo ved, were 
Greeks, but the-they had moved in Athens. So -- 
Q: Let -- let me ask you just a funny questi
on now. You say Greeks, and you mean Greek 
Christians. So what did you call yourself? 

A: Greek Jew. 

Q: Jew. 

A: Greek Jew. 

Q: But when you say Greeks, you don™t mean Jewish. 

A: Greek Orthodox. 

Q: Greek Orthodox when you say Greek. I™
m just -- it™s very -- it™s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
33 
 
A: I said just Greek, an
d like the Greek, we say. 
Q: Right, but you were a Greek Jew, not just Greek. 
A: Yeah. No. 

Q: No, right. Okay. 

A: Definitely. 

Q: Right. When you mo ved to Greece, was that befo
re the Italians attack
ed?  Cause you moved in 
October of 1940.  

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And October 28
th
, the Italians attacked Greece. 
A: Right, and they were gone quickly.  

Q: Yes. 

A: The Greeks were very good. 

Q: Yes, okay. 
A: But I reme mber seeing them, you know, walki
ng through the streets of -- and they were 
huma ns, like all of us. You could see in their face 
that they were thinking of
 their wives, or their 
children, you know?  You could see it. Bu
t the Germans were, I mean, robots. 
Q: Right, uh-huh. 

A: I -- I used to call them robots. 

Q: So when -- when you left Drama with the fam
ily, you left everything there, and you just took 
clothes. And did you go by car? 

A: No, we fl ew.  

Q: You flew from Dra ma to Athens. And did 
you go to some one™s house in Athens, or did you 
rent a pl ace, or buy a place? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
34 
 
A: W- We  rented a place, and then we bought a place. 
Q: Uh-huh. And was it as big, and as -- 

A: No [indecipherable] 

Q: No, it wasn™t, no. It wasn™t like what it was before. 

A: No, it was two storey house w
ith -- it wasn™t the same , no.  
Q: It was -- 

A: It was a mi ddle class peopl
e, even less [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. And what happened to the house? 

A: We left  it there. 

Q: You just left it? Did 
that ma ke you feel funny? 
A: We ll, no, I didn™t even think of it when I 
was -- I didn™t think about
 it. And my parents 
probably did. But when we sold it, we  sold it for nothing. 

Q: Oh. 
A: Cause nobody wanted it. Who wants a big house like that? 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, they were all poor after that.  

Q: After the war. 

A: The war. So we sold it for nothing. 

Q: So you didn™t feel much of a transition togo to Athens and live in a smaller place?  No. 

A: No. 

Q: It™s interesting, cause y --  

A: As long as I was with
 my parents, and --  
Q: It was okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
35 
 
A: -- you know, it was okay. 
Q: And Haim, of course, is with you, yes? 

A: Yes. But we put him first with a friend of our
s, a Christian friend of ours, because we  thought 
to be with us in a house, day and night, he couldn
™t do it. So we left him 
alone with a fa mily, but 
he couldn™t stand it there. 

Q: He couldn™t stand it? 

A: No, because he wanted to be with us. And he wr
ote a letter to my mo ther, and I have to read it 
again, because I forgot it. And it was a -- I read 
little bit, it was so 
sweet to my mother, you 
know?  And she didn™t want to
 -- her to know that she 
wa -- he wasn™t happy. 
Q: Right. 

A: But my mother knew, so we brought him -- 

Q: You brought him to -- so he™d be with you. 
He wasn™t hitting you any more though, I assume . 
A: Oh no, no. 
Q: No, this -- 
A: That was when we were very young. 

Q: Right. And was your father still working in
 Athens?  I mean, how 
would you take care of 
yourself?  

A: We ll, in Athens, see, he didn™t stay only with
 the tobacco, my father. 
And never -- he always 

wanted to do other things.  

Q: Right. 

A: Which, the tobacco company was very big at th
at time , you know, because we used to sell to 
the ma jority companies. And -- but he wanted 
to do some thing else, a
nd in Athens he bought 
things to sell for -- like clothes, 
and for the bedroom things, you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
36 
 
Q: Sheets -- 
A: And -- 

Q: Pillows --  

A: Yeah, and wholesale, and he had the place only for wholesale. 

Q: I see. 

A: He had two places, one that he  could sell ev
ery day, and one that was only wholesale. And -- 
Q: Is there a school for you, or no school? 

A: After the -- 

Q: In 1940 -- not [indecipherable] 

A: In 1940 I went i -- to 
[indecipherable] was a -- 

Q: Public school? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: I had finished public school. 
Q: Uh-huh, high school? 

A: To college , college. 

Q: Oh, to college? In Athens? 

A: But ma ybe less than a year, because the -- 

Q: The Germans come  i n -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- in ™41, yes? 

A: In ™41, they came in?  I don™t reme m -- reme mber. 

Q: I think so, yes. In April they invade -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
37 
 
A: I don™t reme mber.  
Q: -- in 1941. When you moved to Athens and 
you see the Italian soldiers, are you then more 
afraid? 

A: I wasn™t afraid of them. 

Q: Nothing. And you know the war is going on in Europe? 

A: Yeah, I know. 

Q: But you™re not afraid. 

A: But no, because they were -- they were caught
 by the Greeks at the time that I saw them. 

Q: Right, the Italians were stoppe
d, or at least there™
s a stalemate, they 
can™t get through. But 
then the Germans come  i n, and they do win, and 
they divide the country into three parts. 
A: But the archbishop didn™t wa
nt to give us away, but at
 the end, couldn™t ma ke it. 
Q: So -- 

A: And especially there, in Thessaloniki, 
in Salonika, where there were so ma ny, you know? 
Q: Right. No, the Salonika Jews 
just get -- it™s dec -- decimated. 
A: 90 percent of them perished. 

Q: Yes, yes. Do you remember when th -- when, 
after the German invasion, and that Athens is 
occupied by both the Italians and the Ge
rmans?  Do you reme mber seeing both troops? 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. As a matter of fact at th
e beginning, we didn™t th
ink that this -- the 
archbishop didn™t want to give thei
r na -- our name s or any -- anything. I used to go -- I still used 
to go to the theater. We  have an ancient theater in Athens. 

Q: Ancient theater, yeah. 

A: Ancient theater, we -- has a -- ha s a better aco
ustics than the latest theater here in the United 
States. Amazing, it™s unbelievable. So I was in that
 theater, and besides me , there were Germans, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
38 
 
and when I turn, who do I see? My piano teacher, 
that she used to tell me  that she was Jewish, 
and she was German, she  was with the Germans. 
Q: She was with them. So that must have been a big shock, yeah.  

A: And to have the Germans behind us, but we we
ren™t afraid at that 
time, you know?  It™s when 
they started taking the Jews a
nd putting them in -- in Haidari, the prison in Greece, then -- 
Q: Then you got worried. 

A: We  thought that this was mo
me ntarily, and finally you know 
that, and understand that they 
were all -- 

Q: That they would stop. 

A: Yeah, but we were wrong with that. 

Q: Right. We have to stop the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Wer -- where was this ancient theater? 
This wasn™t the colis -- this is not -- 
A: In -- in Athens. 
Q: In Athens. 

A: But they are in other parts of the --
 but this one was -- is inside Athens. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And if you heard Yanni. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Have you heard Yanni? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: He played in that theater in Athens. 

Q: Uh-huh, so -- I see. These outdoor theaters ar
e just -- it™s outdoors, ri
ght?  It™s -- it™s 
wonderful. 
A: Outdoors, wonderful. And always it™s ni
 -- in the evening it™s always nice. 
Q: Right. 
A: You never get hot or sweating, or -- 

Q: No ma tter when, in the year, really?  It s
ounds wonderful. Were ther
e restrictions once the 
Germans took over Athens?  Did you ha
ve to wear a Jewish st ar -- 
A: No. 

Q: No Jewish star? 

A: No. They took us all of the sudden, you know, it se
emed, that they decided to take us in -- in 
Athens. I don™t know what they did in Salonika.  

Q: No, but you™re not -- you™re
 go -- you move too fast. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
40 
 
A: Okay. 
Q: That was in 1944. I™m talking about 1941. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When they take over, are there -- 
there must be restrictions for Jews? 
A: No, n-not yet. 

Q: No?  

A: They asked to show up in the synagogue. I don
™t know too much because, see, I wasn™t with 
the -- the rest  of the Jews to see -- 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: -- what wa s going on. See, I was i-inside with this family. And -- 

Q: No, I™m t a lking about before you™re in hidi
ng. You go into hiding f -- ™42 - ™43, but you™re not 

-- you™re in your house with your 
parents and Haim in 1941, yes? 
A: No, no. 
Q: No?  
A: In 1941, yes. 

Q: Yes. So for one year -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you™re not in hiding. 

A: Mm-hm, right. 

Q: Right?  So what happens?  You st
ay pretty muc h in the house? 

A: No, we go out. 

Q: You go out? 

A: Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
41 
 
Q: And -- and so you don™t f
eel -- are you going to school? 
A: No.  
Q: No, you couldn™t bi -- ga
 -- you couldn™t go to school. 

A: Probably -- no, probably that -- that
™s when I used to go to school. 
Q: Now, wa s everybody stopped from going to sc
hool, or only the Jewish students, do you 
r e me mb e r ?  

A: I tell you the -- I don™t reme mber -- 

Q: You don™t reme mber, okay. 

A: -- I mi  -- I don™t -- I don™t know
 what the other children did. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Because I was with Christia
ns, Greeks. Orthodox Greeks.  
Q: Yes. So you don™t know, huh? 

A: I don™t know much. 
Q: So who ma  -- the su -- was there 
a discussion in your house about hiding? 
A: Yes. 
Q: There was? 

A: And then is when we came in contact with 
all our friends. They said you can come  out in 
house whenever you want, in the evening, any time. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the last house that we went to beforewe were caught, they had the big house, they send 

the ma ids away because they were afraid that 
the ma ids ma y say some thing. And they enclosed 
themselves in one room, and they gave us the re
st of the house -- to us, and my father said, ﬁWhy 
are you doing this?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ she sa
id, ﬁbecause I want to show th
at there are ni ce people out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
42 
 
there -- there -- there were, becau
se we can go out, we are free to
 go out any time we want to. 
But you stay home , and you need more room and ever
ything.ﬂ So they did that, and the love that 
they show us, and they used to bri
ng us food and this and that -- amazing. 
Q: Really?  So you didn™t just stay with
 one fa mily during this -- is it -- 
A: No, n-no, about two or  three families. 

Q: Two or three families. And who ma  -- did 
your father ma ke the decision that you sh -- you 
should hide, or was it obvious, there were a lot of fa milies who were doing this? 

A: No, because when we thought that some one has seen one of us, because my brother used to 

walk around, but he thought some one saw him, or
 some one may see him, or some one saw me in 
the -- in the window -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: You know. We  had to move. 

Q: Did you look -- I don™t know what it means in 
Greece. In Poland it seems that some Jews 
looked Jewish to Polish Catholics. Was there a 
look, so that if some one saw Haim they would 
think he was a Jewish -- 

A: N-No, no, but there were some  that look -- s
o. But ma -- the majority 
looked like a -- like a -- 
Q: Like everybody else. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But when you say Haim mi ght be seen, it 
was because he was known to be Jewish -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- not because he looked Jewish, I see. So 
were you afraid of these Germans now?  Did -- at 
some  point did you become  afraid of these guys? 

A: If -- we™re afraid now, or then? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
43 
 
Q: No, no, no, then. 
A: Then. 

Q: When -- when you went into hiding. 

A: We ll, until we went to 
Haidari, I wasn™t afraid. 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. 

A: It -- Haidari they put us in 
a room with two other people, and -- 
and then after th
at they put us 
all together in one big room, where we stayed ther
e, and after a week they send us to -- put us in 
trains. 

Q: In trains, to Auschwitz. 

A: To Auschwitz. 

Q: So the hiding period is not such a terrib
le period because you™re with people who know you. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Who care about you. 
A: In Greece, yes. 
Q: In Greece, and want to be good to you. But your
 life is all indoors, because the Germans are 

clearly looking for Jews, yes? 

A: Or some one will tell them -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- there, because the Germans di dn™t know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- who were Jews, and who were not, you 
know. Or, we didn™t have ghettos like -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- other pl aces. We  lived everywhere.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
44 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So they couldn™t know unless some
body told them that these are Jews. 
Q: Right. Now, your father is not working when
 you™re in hiding, or is he going in and out? 
A: No, he stays in. 

Q: He stays -- he stays inside. Do you think your fa
ther is -- is -- is help
ing with the cost of 
keeping you there by paying people,
 or are these wealthy people
 and they don™t want money? 
A: We ll, they don™t want money, but my father wa
s -- didn™t want them to spend all their money, 
you know?  

Q: Right, right. 

A: We  used to give them money. 

Q: Now, what happened to th
e house that you had bought?  You just
 left that house, with now 
less clothes, I assume , and go into hidi ng. So 
each time you move, you have less and less things. 
Is there something that you take with you because you -- some , I don™t know -- 
A: No, I tell you, when we were caught, we decide
d that -- we  used to listen the radio, th-the 
British -- 

Q: BBC. 

A: -- telling us all the time that we™re comi ng, 
this and that, and years went by and nothing 
happened. And my father was still very young, and my 
brother, they were ge
tting tired. We  leave 
the country. [inaudible]. So we d
ecided to go to Egypt, and from Egypt to Israel, and -- and we 
decided that we™re -- we™re going 
to get dressed as if we™re going 
to a wedding, in case they si -- 
they stop us, we™ll tell them that we are goi
ng to a wedding. And that™s what happened. And a 
friend of ours -- you see, we had so many friend -- 
one of them gave us up. He [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
45 
 
in Germany, and we thought that he was work
ing for the Greek governme nt, trying to find out 
things from the Germans. And ma yb
e he did, but he was on both sides. 

Q: Both sides. 

A: And ma ybe the Germans found out that he was 
hiding Jews, who knows if he gave us up. And 
all of a sudden Germans stop us going to the -- to
 the ship, and since I kn
ew Ger man, I got out of 
the car, and I said, ﬁI don™
t understand why you taking us. I mean now, as you see, we are 
dressed, we are going to a weddi
ng.ﬂ He said, ﬁFraulein, we k
now everything about you. You 
don™t have to tell us any more.ﬂ
 Mm- h m. ﬁSo you™ll come  with us.ﬂ And they took us to a place 
to -- where the Germans were. And they started to 
interrogate first my fat her and my brother. So 
they came back, when they came back I was so sc
ared to look at them, because my father didn™t 
have the front teeth, and you know, it seems that they hit them. So then they came to pick us up, 

my mother and myself. And I spoke to them 
in German bec ause I knew German, and -- and 
probably that™s the reason they 
didn™t behave bad with us, they
 didn™t do anything to us. So we 
went back to the room where my brother and [i
ndecipherable] and my brother come s to me  and 
says, ﬁYou are no longer my sister.ﬂ I said, ﬁW
hy? ﬂ  ﬁWhy they didn™t do anything to you?  Look 
at us,ﬂ you know. ﬁProbably you told them where our
 relatives are.ﬂ I say, 
ﬁI wouldn™t do that for 
anything in the world. They ask me , and do you know 
what I told them?  In -- in German, I told 

them, and they didn™t hit me .ﬂ So, I told the 
Germans, I know where my  -- I don™t know where 
my relatives are, but even if I knew it, 
I wouldn™t tell you. So they started laughing.  
Q: The Germans started laughing?   

A: So then after that they let me  -- let us
 go, you know?  And my brother was very ma d at me  
thinking that if they let us go lik
e that, without hitting us, I told them wher e my relatives are and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
46 
 
so forth. I didn™t do it, and that™s why all my rela
tives who were hidden, they were alive after we 
returned. 
Q: Right, right. Did he believe you? 

A: Who?  

Q: Your brother, when you told him. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: He did. That was a very diffi
cult situation I would imagine -- 
A: It was, it -- it was -- 

Q: -- very painful. 

A: -- it was. 

Q: And hi -- was he hit?  Di
d he look as beaten -- yes. 
A: He -- oh, sure, sure. 

Q: Yes. Do you think also that they were hit 
because they we re me n and you were wome n?  Do 
you think there was some difference? 

A: N-No. 

Q: No. 

A: N-No. They didn™t hit us because I spoke to 
them in Ger man, and I guess they liked that. 
Q: But didn™t your father speak German? 

A: No. 

Q: Oh, he didn™t. 

A: No, that™s why he wanted me  to -- 

Q: I see, I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
47 
 
A: -- learn German, so that when the German come  at our house, some one would know how -- 
what to -- 

Q: Oh yes, right. So did this person who denoun
ced you, who told the Germans, did he know that 
you were leaving?  He must have known, because otherwise why would they stop your car? 

A: Mm-hm, right, right. We told 
him that we were leaving, he --  
Q: Ah, so -- 

A: -- thinking that he was a very good friend. 

Q: Right. But he wasn™t the person at the 
time who was -- whose house you were staying at? 
A: No. 

Q: No, it was some body else™s. 

A: Someone else. We stayed th
ere another time at his house. 

Q: Did you ever re-meet this ma n?  Di d you ever see him again? 

A: Well, I tell you, when -- 
a-after the liberation, I we
nt to the court, and 
he was there. And he 
was sitting in the place where the Gr eeks help 
others, and on the other side where there was 
[indecipherable], and the judge said, ﬁDo you see th
e person that,ﬂ -- I said, ﬁYes, he is right 
there.ﬂ And he said, ﬁHow -- how in the world 
you blame hi m?  He did so much for you, you,ﬂ -- 
so I couldn™t do much more. All I 
wanted to do is because of my 
parents, because I -- I lost my 
parents, I wanted to do -- 

Q: Something. 

A: -- some thing, you know. 

Q: Yes, right.  

A: But I didn™t accomplish anything. He was free.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
48 
 
Q: Mm. The people who were hiding you, wi -- we
re they harmed because they were hiding 
you?  The ger -- they --  
A: No, no. 

Q: They weren™t? 

A: But if th-the Germans would find us there -- 

Q: There. 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: I see. 

A: They would take them to -- to bir -- Berdari,
 and then to Auschwitz. See they -- and they 
knew that, and even though they knew that, they did all these things. 

Q: They did it anyway. But the ge
 -- it™s interesting that the Ge
rmans wouldn™t then try to find 
the people who were hiding you, even though you were outside the house. 

A: Uh-huh. 
Q: Because you would think that they would -- 
A: Yeah, because a -- 

Q: -- punish them. 

A: -- he, the man, that man that 
gave us didn™t tell the name s. 
Q: I see. 

A: See?  We ll, he was a -- a good ma n, until then, you know. 

Q: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So being in Haidari ha
d to be a big shoc k for you, because now you knew 
you were endangered, yes? 

A: We ll, yeah, still wasn™t so ba
d -- well, I thought, who knows, ma ybe
 it™s for a little bit. Then 
they put us in a tra -- the train was te
rrible. So much, so ma ny people there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
49 
 
Q: Tell me  some thing, had you heard the rumo
rs about anything the Nazis were doing?   
A: Oh. 
Q: That they were shooting Je
ws, and some  [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, not much. 

Q: Not much. 

A: But my mother knew more than anybody 
else. She had bought the -- the book that -- 
Q: ﬁMein Kamp f.ﬂ 

A: ﬁMein Kamp f.ﬂ 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But nobody believed her -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- you know?  So this is going to be forgetti 
-- forgotten and everything. So they didn™t pay 
attention.  
Q: So this i --  this is -- 
A: But my mother knew everything. 

Q: So she -- she had the sense that
 something really terribl e was -- 
A: But she didn™t want to upset us.  

Q: So how do you know she knew?
 Did she talk to you later? 
A: We ll, we knew she had the book. We knew 
that she tried to tell s -- people. 
Q: I-I see. And they didn™t liste
n. So, it™s 1944, and you™re 20 years old. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Your brother is 22 and a half -- 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
50 
 
Q: 20 -- right?  And your pa
rents are how old, about? 
A: We ll, you know the date --  
Q: Dates -- 

A: Do you have the dates?  My
 daughter has the dates. 
Q: Let™s see, your father was born 1896 or some thing? 

A: I think so, yeah, my 
-- my mother ni -- 1900. 
Q: So they™re very young peopl
e. They™re in their 40™s. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And they looked good. My mother, the only r
eason they thought she was older is because she 

had white hair. But her face 
was just beautiful, like you. 
Q: And she had white hair when she was very young? 

A: No 
Q: This happened in Athens? 
A: Right, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. That must have been a shock to
 you too, to watch your mother™s hair -- 
A: Yeah, no, no -- 

Q: No?  

A: I don™t think so. So -- 

Q: So ar-are there -- are there me mb ers of your
 family with you in Haidari before you go on the 
train?  Or their friends? There wa
s a group of people that you know -- 
A: Yeah, there were friends, there were friends 
that we knew. It was my e x-husband, his mother, 
his sister, his brother-i
n-law, and his son --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486

 the brother-in-law. 
Q: [indecipherable] So that™s Margosh, yeah. And th
en there are some  friends that you have, that 
you know. 

A: Mm-hm. B-But I -- I met them at the concentration camp. 

Q: In the concentration camp, not on the train? 

A: Midla -- Milka and Leoni. 

Q: Milka and Leoni? 

A: I met them there. 

Q: I see. So tell me about this 
train. How do you get from Haidari to
 the train, is the -- is Haidari 
right near a train st ation? 

A: Yeah, I guess so -- I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber, okay. And wh-what are you allowed to take with you? 
A: Nothing, just what -- 
Q: Nothing? 

A: -- we had in our hands, yes. 

Q: Because you didn™t ha ve anythi ng, you we

A: No, a dress, some thing -- 

Q: Just a regular -- because you were supposed to
 be going to this wedding, but it was not such a

A: Yeah -- no. 

Q: And shoes, just high heels? 

A: I don™t know, ma ybe  w-we changed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
52 
 
Q: Uh-huh. Cause you were in Haidari for a few weeks, yes? 
A: See, because before going to Haidari, they to

we had clothes with us that we taking to -- 

Q: You me a n the Germans took you -- they 
took you someplace to do this questioni ng. 
A: Yeah, right, right. 

Q: So was it a prison or jail, or a room?  

A: No, a -- a house. 

Q: A house, uh-huh. Did they give you food in Haidari? 

A: Yes. 

Q: They did. Wa s it -- you were able to sleep? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah?  So you -- I think you said
 first they put you in a small 
room, and then they put you all 
in one larger room. And Haid
ari was like what -- was it a -- 
A: A prison. 

Q: -- it was a pri -- it was really a prison. A

A: They were all Jews. 

Q: All Jews. 

A: They were all Jews. And then a -- a -- a -- wa

A: And the Rhodes came, there were -- I don™t k
now how to explain this. There were all -- 
Q: Tied?  
A: They th -- they thought that if they we
re in bad shape, the Germans won™t touch them. 
Q: Oh, so they were bandaged? 

A: They were bandaged, yeah. We ll, anyway -- 

Q: It wasn™t the right
 strategy, I guess, right? 
A: And we left with them. 

Q: Uh-huh. So you™re in a cattle tr

A: -- he didn™t. He want to
 stay with my parents. 
Q: Mm-hm. So, does your mother si -- is there

course, they don™t tell you that 
you™re going to Auschwitz, yes? 
A: No, we arrive there, and they

place that I -- I am now. 

Q: Houston. 

A: Houston. 

Q: Yes. 

A: They didn™t know anything about it, nothing a
bout it. So when they saw my number here, 
they said, ﬁIs this your phone numbe r? ﬂ And they 
ask all kinds of silly questions all the time. 
And I have a very good friend, Jewish friend with
 me , and he says, ﬁYou know, Rachelle, I have 

a good dermatologist, what about -- I think he can 
do that, he can take it off.ﬂ Because it was for 

me , it was so demeaning, for people to think that I put my -- 

Q: Telephone number, yeah. 

A: And at that time  we didn™t have a car
, I was wa iting for the bus, you know, and everybody 
would ask questions, and I didn™t wa

Q: To the gas chamber?  But this was a way to save you, what she told. She knew what she was 

doing. 
A: The reason she did that is to -- to save me
, right, because  if I -- I would go with my mother, 
they™d the same thing. But I t
hought that was a good idea, she w
on™t work, and she™ll be better 
off. 
Q: And how long did it take you 
to find out what had happened? 

A: Al most at the end.

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Rachelle, I wanted to go back to 1940 for a bi
t because I know you told me  that your mother 
wrote a letter to -- was it the head of a theater? 

A: Yes, so we went to the theater -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- together with my mother, and she was so 
upset by seeing a Jew portrayed in a very negative 
stereotype -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that  she immediately wrote a letter to the dir
ector of the theater. So, 
I™m going to read the -- 
Q: So yo-you re -- read an 
excerpt in English, yeah. 
A: -- an excerpt of the letter. Let™s 
-- when she wrote to the director.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: ﬁI was shocked when looking at the s
cenes, I saw how you portrayed my people. 
Unfortunately, I know you always had this opinion a
bout us, which is not ri
ght at all. At least 
this time  you should avoided all of this, duringthe difficult times that we are now having. The 

Jewish people are fighting with such pathos
 and heroism for our country, Greece, and –ﬂ 

Q: Can you see it?  -- ﬁheroism for our country 
Greece, and giving everyt hi ng of thems e lves to 
win the war.ﬂ Giving.  

A: Giving, okay. 

Q: Giving, yeah.  

A: All right, I wi -- I start agai
n. ﬁThe Jewish people are fighti
ng with such pathos and heroism 
for our country, Greece, and giving everyt
hing of themselves to win the wa r.ﬂ 
Q: Right. And then she asks that
 he take out these characters 
from the play. Did they do it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
60 
 
A: We ll, she ask that, but I don™t know, we didn™t go back. 
Q: Uh-huh. Did you see this play? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You did, and what did you think? 

A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. Did you know -- did you know at the time that she was writing this 

letter? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yes.  

A: She wrote it in front of me. 

Q: Uh-huh. And was she like this?  Wa s this the ki
nd of thing that she would do, she would think 
that she had to act? 

A: [inaudible] yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: She was that kind of person, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: She -- when she felt like she was right, she would talk. 

Q: Right. So she was a strong woma n in ma ny wa ys? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: She was.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
61 
 
Q: And I know you have the original in Greek, yes.
 That™s quite some thing. So let™s get back to 
where we were, you were in Auschwitz for a fe
w months, and then they took you out and sent 
you to Bergen-Belsen, am I correct
?  Do you remember whether this
 was before -- there was an 
uprising in Auschwitz in October.
 Do you think this was before 
the uprising, or it was after the 
uprising, or -- or do you not reme mb er
?  You don™t reme mber . Do you reme m -- 
A: All I reme mber that my friend Paula, she star
ted to be upset that I 
was getting too thin, and 
they would take me  to the -- 

Q: The [indecipherable]
 of the hospital? 
A: No, to -- 

Q: Oh, to the gas? 

A: To the gas.  

Q: Ah. 

A: And it was the day that they 
were looking at different barrack
s to find out which ones were 
thin, and -- or not healthy, you know? 

Q: Right. 

A: So -- and my friend Paula took me  to her barr
ack while they were doing 
that, and that™s how I 
survived, otherwise I would have been with -- 

Q: Now, is Paula some body you knew from Athens? 

A: No. 

Q: Or had you -- you met her in Auschwitz? 

A: I me t her in Haidari, I believe I did.  

Q: Where did you meet her, in Haidari? 

A: Haidari. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
62 
 
Q: Uh-huh, so she was Greek? 
A: Oh yes. But she ma rried a Christian.  

Q: Mm-hm. So this was quite an act -- 

A: And she wrote also poems about the Holocaust
 and everything, and I have one poem with me , 
I don™t know where it is. Rinette has it 
probably. And it™s 
very interesting. 
Q: Uh-huh. Well, ma ybe  we can read it later. 

A: And her po -- poems, she was an international poem thing -- 

Q: A competition? 

A: Y-Yeah. 

Q: Really? 

A: And that was here in Wash
ington I believe, and she won it.
 Yeah, yeah, and I have some  
papers with me. 

Q: And wha t ™s her -- 
A: She died. We  were such good friends, even though w-we lived so far away from each other. 
Q: Yes. 

A: We used to call each other 
every si -- almost every day. 
Q: Really? 

A: And all of a sudden I heard she died.  

Q: And how was she able to come  to you in the other barrack?  We re you working in a similar 

place in Auschwitz so she could see you regularly? 

A: Well see, she wasn™t like
 all of us, she was like -- 
Q: Oh, she was a blochal -- sh -- 
a Blochalteste, she was the head 
of the barrack [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, I™d say so. But she was Jewish. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
63 
 
Q: Right. But she had more freedom to move around. 
A: Right, right, right. 

Q: So that was wonderful for her to do that, yeah.  

A: She could be in trouble also. 

Q: Of course. Did you then go back to your barr
ack, or you stayed in her barrack, do you think? 
A: I stayed for a little bit, until they left -- 
the Nazis from our  bar -- they took whichever they 
found, and they left, and then she took me  back. 

Q: I see. So she was 
a real protector, huh? 
A: Yeah. And she was always
 like that, till she died.  
Q: Was she older than you? 

A: No, I think we were the same  age. 

Q: About the same  age? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: When did she die?  Fe w years ago, about -- 
A: I think it™s a -- a year ago. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I™m not sure. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: My mi nd is getting so bad. Rinette probably will reme mber. 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember leavi
ng Auschwitz for Bergen-Belsen? 
A: N -- well, what I reme mber is that they ha
d us for a couple of days
 outdoors, it was raining 
and everything, and we didn™t have any clothe
s, or right shoes, or anything, you know. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
64 
 
A: And -- and until today I™m fl abbergasted how I didn™t get sick. The whole time that I was 
there, I never had any headache,
 or I was sneezing or anythi n
g. You know, isn™t that strange? 
Q: Yeah. So you -- you™re saying in -- 

A: And I don™t know, maybe it -- this time when we
 were out [indecipherable] wome n, then they 
moved us. And then they took us to wher
e they ma ke ar ms  a nd things like that. 
Q: Uh-huh. A munitions factory. 

A: Yeah, a factory. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: And -- 

Q: This is in Bergen-Belsen?  You think -- you -- 

A: I don™t know, I think it 
was in Bergen-Belsen. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: I don™t reme mber. And we were staying there for 
a little bit. In the meantime they heard that 
the -- the allies were comi ng. And they gave it 
to each one of us, my friends and mys e lf, they 
gave us something to cover ourself. It™s b
ecause the allies were comi ng. And so -- and we 
couldn™t see, you know, because it wa s cold, and we
 had it lowered, and I couldn™t see where my 
friends were, and we used to call ev
ery five mi nutes, Leoni, Milka,  
Q: Right, right. 

A: And then finally -- we always stay together,and they took us to Theresienstadt. That was a 

ghetto, and there were -- there were
 Jewish doctors and everything, a
nd they were so sweet to us, 
so nice. And my hair had starte
d to -- to be okay, you know, I had so
me  ha ir after all this time. 
Q: Right, right.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
65 
 
A: So, and -- to one of the [indecipherable], because they were cutting our hairs because we had 
typhus, all of us. So I said, ﬁ Would you please don™
t cut my hair,ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁbecause I™m going to 
meet my father pretty soon, and I 
don™t want him to see me  like that.ﬂ And he said okay, and he 
took care, he treated me  and everything, and he
 [inaudible] you know, and then we -- we were 
there, all Jews in this ghetto, and -- and they 
would come  to me  and say Rachelle -- the Russians 
-- 

Q: After the liberation, yeah, yeah. 

A: -- the -- the -- the Russians ar
e outside, and they™re cookin
g, and we didn™t have any food. 
Said, ﬁWhy don™t you go in the wi
ndow, ma ybe they™ll give you 
some  food? ﬂ  I said, ﬁWhy don™t 
you go?  I mean, th-there™s a -- why are you sending 
me , I do -- I don™t want to go.ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ they 
said, ﬁyou are the only one who has hair.ﬂ 

Q: So did you go? 

A: We ll, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. And did they give you food? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. What were the Russians like
 when they came, do you reme mber ? 
A: We ll, they seemed to be very sweet and ever
ything. And then after that, they moved me  to a 
hospital where the Russians were, because they di
dn™t have all the necessary things ther e in the 
ghetto. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So -- and they took me  there, and while I was 
there I heard that they 
were taking all the Jews 
to Siberia. And I thought to myself, no way. So I 
had th -- they gave me  
a shirt to sleep, and I 
had -- how do you call it -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
66 
 
Q: The pillowcase? 
A: The pillowcase. From the pillowcase I ma de th
at -- a skirt, because I couldn™t go out, and I 
couldn™t go through the door because they will attack me , you know. 

Q: Right. 

A: So, from the window, I -- 

Q: You jumped from the win -- 

A: -- I jump ed. And nothing -- I was very thi

started walking fast. And I found some  French wome
n that they -- I-I knew
 in the concentration 
camp, and they said to me , ﬁ Oh Ra
chelle, comme vous êtes chic.ﬂ  
Q: Whoa. 

A: Chic. 

Q: Chic [indecipherable] 

A: See, I had the -- my hair. 
Q: Right. 
A: And so that was funny. And I always say so
mething funny to friends if they ask me

and then you all became  interpreters -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- with the Americans? 

A: Yes. See, we -- we didn™t want to stay ther

se -- so i -- it was the 
French Red Cross that came  to pick up their pe

they took us, and they took us to wher
e the Americans were, in Frankfort. 

Q: Did they say that you were
 French?  Did you say we™re Fren

French, do you reme mbe r? 

A: We  -- we spoke to them fr -- in French, yeah --

 do you think, rather than to the French side? 
A: Well, that ™s where they were -- they weren™t going straight to -- 
Q: Uh-huh, I see. 

A: -- yeah, they stopped there. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the Americans [indecipherable] they wanted 
us as interpreters, and 
they gave us clothes 
because we didn™t have any clot
he s, we were dressed alike. 

Q: Right.

those photographs, so soon you gained -- 
A: Yeah, I-I know. I know, and the l-la
ughing, I mean, like nothing happened.

A: Yeah, it™s because we  had th-that kind 
of thought, you know?  We ™ll forget what -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- hap -- happened in the past, no
w we™ll have to start a new life --

certain way, and you don™t know what™s happened to Haim, to your father -- 

A: I didn™t know until later, until I came here. 

Q: Right. 

A: Rinette tried to -- because you 
see, Rinette said, ma ybe he went

said, if [indecipherable] they se

lligent not to know how to come  
back to Greece, you know?  So 
I didn™t belie
ve that -- 
Q: That he went, yes. 

A: So then we found out that he 
died imme diately after the war -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And my father,too. 

Q: And the three of you, you and your two friends
, go back to Athens because you™re all hoping 
to find fa mily, I assume? And you -- 

A: And the thing is, where I used to ask rush --
 the Russians, that we wanted to go back to 
Greece, and they said, well, we can gi ve you some
 money. But we were -- how can we go from -
- that far, you know, go to Greece with a little bi
t of money. Was imposs i ble. Instead, when I 
spoke to the Russians, the Russian were telling 
us, we™ll take you to America, and we™ll give you 
good life and everythi ng. Ye -- well,
 I-I said I™m sorry, I said -- 
Q: You me a n the Americans said this to you. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Not the Russians, yes, okay, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486

 I said, ﬁWe can™t go 
now because we have to go back and find out -- our parent s, if our parent s returned.ﬂ And do you 
know what?  He gave us a plane. 

Q: He gave you a --

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. See, w-who would do that?  Nobody, nobody. Th
ey were so nice, it™s -- I™ll never forget 

that. 

Q: No. But then of course, you go back. 
A: But you know, it was one of us when -- a Jewish ma n that he ask me  to be his girlfr iend, and I 
said, I™m sorry. At this point, you know, my mi
nd is not ki -- cannot
 think anything, you know, 
right now. I want to go to Greece and find my parents. 

Q: Right. 

A: So what he did is he was wr
iting the name s that will be on th
e plane, he took my name  off. A 
Jewish man. 

Q: He took it off?  Because he 
wanted you to be his girlfriend? 

A: Yeah, because I said that I couldn™t be, be
cause -- I had a good reason, I mean it™s not that I 
was going with anybody else, or anything. 

Q: Right, right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
71 
 
A: I said that I wasn™t ready for something like 
that. And so a friend of mi ne, Leoni, took the list, 
and she says, ﬁ Well, Rachelle is not
 here in this list.ﬂ And that™s
 how I know. I got back into the 
list, and I went. 
Q: So he put you back on? 

A: We ll, Leoni put it back on. 

Q: Or la -- Le oni -- but this was a very difficu
lt trip for you, because what you found at the ot her 
end was that no one -- 

A: We ll, we didn™t expect the same  day to fi
nd them, you know?  We  thought with another plane, 

with -- or maybe they -- they -- there were nice 
other people like this Ame r icans, you know. So -
- and ma ybe they™ll come  in a few days. And my 
uncle, which -- I mean, he -- like I said, he™s a 

good ma n, very good ma n, he helps others, he doesn™t 
care about himself, but he wants to help 
with the rest of the fa mily. He went to -- to 
our friends, and he wanted
 the things they were 
holding for us, to take h-he -- 
and you know, ma -- our friends were embarrassed by that. They 
[indecipherable] and they said well, when Rache
lle or the rest of the fami ly come s, you know, 
we™ll gi ve it to them. 

Q: Now, th-the -- the people who were holding yo
ur -- the stuff from your fa mily, were these the 
people who were hiding you also, 
or was this another family? 
A: We ll, we -- we used to go from one house to the other. 

Q: Uh-huh. So they kept it for you, and are those 
the people you went to first when you came?  
A: In Athens? 

Q: Yeah, do you reme mb er? 

A: No, first we bought a house, because the Germans weren™t there yet.

And -- and with that ma n that gave us up, you 
know, to the Germans -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: All this started comi ng up, you know, and I didn™
t want to think much about it. So -- and I 
was involved with my relatives and others, so --

A: I only reme mber one name , Kalantzi. He™s 
the one who wrote the poem, but I didn™t know 
him, I knew his -- a-another ma n that was a frie
nd of my father, and 
his name was Kalantzi. 
Q: Kalantzi, uh-huh. 
A: But this one I didn™t know, as -- just we 
me t, you know, and it™s amazing the poem he wrote. 
Things that we Jews don™t say, you know, he said 
for us. And that™s the kind of friends we need. 
We can say a lot of things, instead of ma king fr
iends, we can ma ke enemies, but when they say 
the good things, then people listen.  

Q: Mm-hm. So were the three 
of you living together when you we
nt back to Athens, or did you 
split up? 

A: We ll, we intended that because  Leoni had an a
unt in Athens that survived, and she had a big 
house, and she told us you stay with me , we™ll st
ay together. But when my cousin came  to see 
me , she said -- he said, no I don™t think you can stay
 here because my mot her will die. See, she 
was my only aunt, there. But I wish
 I would stay with my friends. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486

Q: Mm-hm. So then you stayed with your aunt
, uh-huh. That was -- was 
that difficult for you? 
A: It was difficult because I c
ouldn™t talk. I -- I used to say 
-- you know me, I don™t say things 
that are very bad, you know? 
Q: Right. 

A: I try to make things, I don™t know, easier a litt
le bit for the other pers
on that listens. And I 
didn™t -- knowing that she lost her brother, you k
now, I tried to be nice, and yet she -- she fell 
down by herself. She lost -- 

Q: You me a n, she became  w
eaker? Or she really fell? 
A: Sh-She fell.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: How you say that -- the word when -- 

Q: She collapsed? 

A: Collapsed. 
Q: Uh-huh. Was this -- your aunt wa s on your 
father™s side, or your mother™s side? 
A: On my father™s side. 
Q: Your father™s side. So you r
eally couldn™t talk with her? 
A: Not much. 

Q: Yeah. So how long did you live with her?  Do you reme mb er? 

A: Well a la -- I lived about a year . 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then I went to the house that my father
 had bought. But other people were living inside. 
So they decide to give me  two or three rooms there. So I stayed there for awhile, and then my ex-

husband -- we used to be good friends, but th
at™s all, you know?  I 
was too young, and I didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
74 
 
date before, I didn™t know too much about me n. 
I don™t know -- well, I thought since he is my 
best friend, you know, we™ll be good. But unfortuna
tely -- I -- I stayed with him until the 
children grew up, they finished college and everyt
hing. And then I thought, ah
 well, that™s it, I ca 
-- I can™t take no more.  
Q: Right. 

A: And you know, some times I think ma ybe the r
eason that we both went through a lot, ma ybe 
this is the reason that we couldn™t stay together. 

Q: Because it was too much to be -- 

A: You know, yeah. 

Q: It™s possible. 

A: Yeah, you know, because if I would ma rry so
meone that didn™t go through all this -- we 
would just say some ti me s jokes and things like that, th
at will ma ke me  change 
little bit, or -- but 
no, it -- it wasn™t a -- 
Q: It wasn™t easy. 
A: It wasn™t easy. 

Q: And did you have two children?  Rinette
 is one, and a boy, or another girl? 
A: A boy. I lost my son. 

Q: You lost your son. 

A: I lost my son when he was 25. 

Q: Oh my. So you haven™t had an easy time at all. 

A: That was my worst part.  

Q: Did you -- did you talk a lot about the Holocaust
, a-about your experien
ces after the war?  You 
didn™t?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
75 
 
A: Cause nobody knew in Houston about it.  
Q: And you -- when you were in Greece, 
were you talking with people mo re?   
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 

Q: It was -- it was -- did it ma ke it easier to talk? 

A: Yeah, right, because  they were asking me  questions like you ask me  now. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Exactly like that.  

Q: And that was easier? 

A: But still I wouldn™t say, because my a
unt fainted, and I found out the word now. 
Q: And so you thought that that™s what peo -- 
what would happen to people if you talked?  You 
would be doing some thing bad to them. 

A: And I tried to ma ke some  jokes, and I mean [i naudible] 

Q: Yeah, right. I -- okay, let™s change the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: You know, it™s interesting, be
cause it -- when the camera wa
s not -- wa s not on, you were 
talking about what you had to learn, which I gue
ss you watched your mother cooking, but you -- 
A: I didn™t. 
Q: Oh, you didn™t? So you were not 
aware of how to keep a house? 
A: Is th -- the way, is I smell the food, that™s
 how I thought that that™s
 what probably did it. 
Q: So you -- you could tell what the smell was -- 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- that a food should -- 

A: And my ex-husbandused to 
say that I™m the best cook.  
Q: How long did it take you 
to learn how to cook? 
A: It didn™t take me  long. 

Q: Didn™t take you long? 
A: No. And it™s amazed me. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Because I never liked to cook, and I cook so we
ll, because he used to say that I™m the best 
cook. 

Q: Right. Was it easy for you to learn how to 
take care of children, or was that hard? 
A: It was hard, especially that my ex-husband didn™
t -- he wasn™t the type to -- what he -- when 
he wanted to talk to them, he would write to me , 
please tell Rinette so and so, or tell Fr ed so and 
so, you know. 

Q: Really?  So he wouldn™t communicate? 

A: And he wouldn™t communicate with me  that -- he -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
77 
 
Q: Ah -- wa -- but he™s communicating with you?
 No. Wa s he different after you got ma rried 
than before? You said you were best friends, 
so you must have communicated beforehand? 
A: Yes, very much. 
Q: But not after. 

A: He change afterwards. I don™t know why. 

Q: People are complicated. 

A: Yeah, that™s right. 

Q: Why did you come  to the United States? 

A: He wanted to come .  

Q: He wanted to come . Did you?   

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Because I believed in fa mily and being t
ogether, to the place where you™re born, where you 
have friends, where you have family. I believe in that. 

Q: Right. 

A: Now if you tell me  to go back, I won™t go -- go 
back. I lived here for 52 years and I love this 
country. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, and if I want to trav
el -- before, I used to love to travel in Europe, you know, go to 
Paris, London, this and -- I don™t care any more
. If some body t e lls me  here, the United States to 
go, that™s what I want to do, you know? 

Q: In the United States, uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. I feel that th
is is my country now. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
78 
 
Q: Right. 
A: So it™s true that w -- there are mi stakes done
 in every -- but in the history, when is -- was 

everything all right, you know. 

Q: Right, right. But why Houston?  You stay
 in Ne w York for a f -- couple of months 
[indecipherable] 

A: Okay, a friend of his --  

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- came in Texas, and they -- the pa -- there 
was a ma n and a wife, and they told him that it 
was very nice, and that -- so his [indecipherable]
 our relatives in New York, they wanted us to 
stay there. You know, they had jobs for us and ev
erything. But he didn™t wa
nt to stay there.  
Q: Now, his sister was alive after the war,
 am I right? His sister -- hi s -- her -- 
A: Yes, his sister, all the -- 

Q: -- her -- her husband -- 
A: -- all his -- husband di
ed, and their child. 
Q: -- and the child died.  
A: And he -- she was also very good friend to me .  

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: I consider her a good friend. 

Q: But Houston, when you move there, must have
 been nothing. So it mu st have bee -- comi ng 

from New York especially, let alone fr
om Greece. Did you get depressed?  Yeah. 
A: But I try not to be -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- because I was busy all the time . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
79 
 
Q: Right. 
A: No -- nobody said, are you depressed. I didn™t -- 

Q: No, nobody asked. 

A: No, nobody ask, and I don™t think I 
show anybody that I™m depressed.  

Q: Uh-huh, yeah. 

A: I try to do the best I can. And then I -- I deci
de that I have to drive,
 and I took lessons again, 
you know?  The driver, you know, s-saw my license, 
say why -- ﬁI can take
 you t -- a couple of 
times, you know.ﬂ ﬁNo,ﬂ I said, ﬁthink that I am 
a  -- a child, I™m just starting now, and we™ll go 
from there.ﬂ And that™s what she did. She wa
s very good, and I got some pa -- a -- I still am 
afraid to dr ive. 

Q: Really?  Were you afraid 
when you got your license? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: When did you get your license? 
A: When I -- we came here. 
Q: So -- but you drove? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: But you drove always with fear? 

A: Drove a little bit, ma ybe, but not much.  

Q: We ll to -- what were you afraid of?  What are you afraid of? 

A: Especially I was afraid hitting some body, 
or -- you know, I wasn™t afraid that somebody 
would hit me.  

Q: But you were afraid of -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
80 
 
Q: But you™ve never hit anybody. 
A: I still -- I still have this f
ear, to -- to -- for you to give me  a gun, I would never take it. If you 
give it to me  like that for -- as a gift, never 
take it. You know, I™d rather some body shoot me  than 
to shoot anybody else. 

Q: Right. So what is that?  Where does that come  from?  

A: That™s me . 

Q: That™s you? 

A: And I don™t ask my daughter how she thinks, 
or how she doesn™t thin
k. You know, it™s their -- 
it™s her person, and we are all different. 

Q: Right, right. You know, there™s -- 

A: We ll, of course in Greece then, nobody had guns.  

Q: Guns, right. But you know what the -- Plato q
uoted Socrates as sayi
ng it™s better to suffer 
wrong than to do wrong. So I begin to think that 
maybe this comes from your Greek background.  
A: The Greek philosophy. 

Q: Right. Maybe. 

A: Maybe. I didn™t think 
about that, but ma ybe.  
Q: I don™t know any -- 

A: You know, the friend of -- the h-husb
and of Paula™s is Socrates. He died. 
Q: His name  was Socrates? 

A: His name  was Socrates. 

Q: When did you decide you would tell your childre
n about your experiences?  Did you tell them 
when they were very young, or did you wait? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
81 
 
A: I wait, because they didn™t have a chance to 
speak with anybody. It was much too much to tell 
them, and to keep them inside of them. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: You know, nobody, even in the synagogues, there 
-- people won™t let their -- the rabbi to 
speak about the Holocaust, until r
ecently. About 10 days in -- 10 y
ears, because they didn™t want 
their children to know. 

Q: They didn™t want thei
r children to know, period. 

A: So it was very hard for the children [inaudible] 

Q: Because they felt something. So did it take you a long time  to -- 

A: Their --of course they felt some thing, because they saw the number on the -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- on the -- on his father, and then some ti me s some thing was said among -- among us, the 

father and me, you know. Or they would hear some thing on television. They knew, because my 
daughter one time, she said, ﬁIs that what th
e Germans did to you? ﬂ When she was watching 
some thing. 
Q: And wha t  did you -- did 
you say yes, or did you -- 
A: I said not exactly. 

Q: But that was the extent of you -- 

A: Yeah, right. 

Q: So when did you tell her?  Cause she know -- she knows -- 

A: Well, it™s after I 
brought her here -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
82 
 
A: -- last year. It did a lot of 
good her. She wasn™t talking at all.
 See? And I thought -- and I tell 
you the truth, if I came, I came more for her. So 
that she will see other pe
ople, she will talk, she 
will fi nd out things -- 
Q: I see.  

A: -- and you know, because you know, I-I could tell her suffering, you know? 

Q: Yes. And she -- she -- 

A: She had -- she had to let it go, you know, and talk. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I think it did a lot of good, because comi
ng back to Houston, she started talking and 
being involved in everything.  

Q: And could she hear you better, do you think? 

A: Yeah, I think so, and we talked
 these things together a lot. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
A: We  didn™t talk for years, until recently. 
Q: So the tribute -- you™re talki
ng about the Holocaust museum tri
bute to survivors in Nove mber 
of ™93. I guess it was a year ago. No, less 
than a year ago. Th
is past November. 
A: Yeah, right.  

Q: Is that ™93? 

Q2: ™03. 

Q: ™03. I™m sorry. ™03, right, 2003. Well that™s intere
sting, because it™s a long 
time to not talk. Do 
you wish you had spoken before, in some  ways, or not? 

A: We ll, I was hurting her, it
 felt like I was hurting her. 
Q: By telling her? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
83 
 
A: Yeah. That™s why I wa nted t -- for her to 
talk with other people 
the same  age, you know. 
Q: Right, right, right. Do you think she thinks it 
hurts you too much to talk, so that™s why it hurts 
-- see that  -- that -- 
A: Exactly. Exactly. 

Q: So in some  ways it stops both of you, 
because you don™t want to hurt each other. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: That™s right, she™s very sensitive. 

Q: Right. Have you talked with -- with your grandson? 

A: Not much. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But I think probably hi s mother talked to him a little bit. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: Not much, but -- 
Q: Right. Have you ever talked in
 schools, with -- with kids? 
A: We ll, I tell you, they were as
king me a lot to go to schools a
nd talk, and I went once, they 
force [indecipherable]. It was a woman from a 
school, a Jewish woma n, but she used to teach 
that school, it was for advanced children. And they
 told her to -- to whom to come , and she came 
to me. I liked her very much. And I said, ﬁWell 
why you want me ?  You see that I have difficulty, 

and,ﬂ -- I said, ﬁI can tell you -- I can tell you 
which people you can go to, and th-they help you 
out better.ﬂ ﬁNo,ﬂ she said, ﬁI want you.ﬂ 
And she kept comi ng, comi ng at my house until she 
made me go. I said, ﬁOkay, but we won™t let 
my daughter come, because she™s going to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
84 
 
embarrassed.ﬂ So -- and she didn™t come , we didn™t 
tell her. So -- and I went with her, and the 
children were so involved that they di
dn™t want to go. They [indecipherable] 
Q: They didn™t want to leave you? 
A: They didn™t want to go. The -- their mothers 
came  to pick them up and they didn™t want to 
leave. So what happened is their mothers stayed
 there. And -- and the mothers all start asking 
questions. I -- I th -- I thought th
at I won™t be able to -- to 
talk, and I said I™ll embarrass 
everybody, you know?  But they liked it. And -- and 
they keep asking me  again and again, but I 
said, ﬁI don™t know what happened 
that day,ﬂ I said, ﬁit™s a mi racl
e, because I -- I 
can™t -- I can™t 
discuss.ﬂ  

Q: Did it mean some thing to you that they we
re so involved?  Was that goo -- good for you? 

A: Oh, of cour --  

Q: It must have been, yes, huh? 

A: -- oh, you should see the way the children ca
me  and hugged me , and one black child was 
there, and -- what did he say?  
I don™t reme mber what, he said so
mething that impressed me, but I 
can™t reme mber. And -- and the one Jewish girl, 
her mother ma -- married a -- a Jew, and her 
mother was -- she sa id that, ﬁIf I lived at that tim
e in Europe,ﬂ she said, ﬁt
hat™s what they will do 
to me , too, even though.ﬂ I said yes. It doesn™t 
ma ke [indecipherable]. I had to be honest, you 

know. Because it doesn™t -- if one 
of the parent Jew, they go. 
Q: Right. So, if that was so meaningful, w
hy do you think you didn™t do it again?  You think it 
was some miracle?  It 
was some  odd event? 
A: It couldn™t have been me
, I couldn™t [indecipherable] 
Q: It couldn™t be you?  
I don™t think you™re right. 
A: That™s what I used to say, why doesn™t me  believe me? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
85 
 
Q: Tell me  some thing, what do you -- what did all of this teach you, you think? 
A: Well, it teaches me to learn lessons from the 
past, and not to ne -- e -- repeat them again, 
because we™re getting more interesting, more 
intelligent, it™s -- it™s
 why go through this? 
Q: You think the world has changed? 

A: It hasn™t change, but
 we want to change. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, they can see all these things. Instead of
 having all of these ugly
 movies and everything, 
we should have more history, say what happe
ned, you know?  And things
 keep repeating and 
repeating, and they™re getting worse now. So -- 

Q: So do you really think peopl
e can learn from the past? 
A: I don™t think, no. 

Q: But you as an individual, did you th
ink that these events changed you? 
A: Of course I™m not the same  person that I 
was before, but I™m stronger. Maybe you see me  
now walking when I [indecipherable] today I wasn™t
 feeling well. But I feel
 strong inside of me . 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And I feel like we have to do 
the best we can, and talk. Talk not ma liciously, talk in the way 
that we can understand each other, 
and be friends with each other. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And everybody can, if they want to pray to God, 
or they wa nt to pray to Christ, and they can 
do that. But you can -- there™s no reas
on for us not to talk, not to be friends. We  all are children 
of God.  

Q: But you also learned that from yo
ur father, didn™t you, in some  way? 
A: Well -- well, I -- I think I lear ned more from
 my uncle [indecipherable] than my fa ther. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
86 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Mm-hm. He was very religious. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: My father wasn™t. He would wake up in the morning and he™ll put his -- 

Q: Tefillin on, yeah? 

A: Uh-huh, yeah. And five o™clock he™ll be up.  

Q: This is your uncle? 

A: He was a very good ma n, and ve ry religi
ous. None of us was -- was religious. 

Q: Wa s -- yes. And you™re more religious now than you were when you were a child, when you 

were younger, or not? 

A: We ll, I believe -- n-now I believe that ou
r religion ma kes sense, 
you know?  And I don™t see 
any other ma kes sense as a -- as ours. And I th
ink it™s superior. And I 
feel like how can anybody 
believe anything else, you know, and 
we do. We  ma de mi stakes, too. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But still, I think, we gave
 the best to the world.  
Q: Uh-huh. Is there anything more you™d like 
to say?  Some thing I haven™t asked you, or 
[indecipherable] think? 

A: No. 

Q: You don™t know, huh? 

A: I wish I can think some thing. 

Q: Let me  a sk you what™s -- what -- I don™t even 
know if it™s a fair question. Do you wish all of 
that didn™t happen?  I know -- I mean it -- clear
ly you wish that your relatives hadn™t died, and 
other people hadn™t died. But in terms of what
 happened to you, since you survived, do you look 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0486  
87 
 
at your life and say I just wish all of that di
dn™t happen, or is there 
some thing about it that 
actually became  i mportant for you in who you became?  I don™t know if that™s even a fair 
question, but -- 

A: Well, I thi -- I couldn
™t wait to -- to be free. And I thought 
the first thing that I would do is I 
would go to a mountain and thank God, you know?  Or 
-- but I was too sick and -- to do that, I 

couldn™t do it. First thi -- I -- 
I had -- I couldn™t understand why God did this to us. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: Couldn™t understand. But now I feel 
ma ybe they are in better place. 
Q: Really? 

A: And I™m not afraid to die 
myself. I™m going with them.  
Q: We ll, I want to thank you. It™s really
 been wonderful to be with you today.  

A: Oh, I hope so. 

Q: It really has, it™s
 been a pleasur e for me. 
A: Okay, oh, you -- you™re wonderful. 
I couldn™t do it with anybody else. 

Q: Oh, well, well. It™s really be very moving for me  to be with you. 

A: Thanks so much.

difficult times, and things were so, we could 
not believe they were 
true. Your hair was a 
beautiful color of black and blue. I will never forget our shatteri
ng experience. When we arrive 
in Auschwitz my train -- by train, it was as if
 we had enter a me ntal institution. Everybody was 
shouting and pushing us. We  had little time  to sa
y good-bye to our mothers, and they faded away 
forever. We  felt exhausted. The place was like he
ll. The smoke was getting thicker. We didn™t 
know then, and we learned the following day th
at the smoke  was the result of burning our 
parents.ﬂ She says [indecipherabl
e]. ﬁI had no time to cry. Our nightma re had just started. As I 
turned around, I saw Rachelle with all her hair 
gone. I felt a sudden sadness,
 and I cried.ﬂ That™s 
when they took my hair. 

Q: Thank you. 

A: You™re very welcome. Thank you. 

Q: Thank you very much.
