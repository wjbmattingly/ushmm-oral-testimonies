 A.
 What is your full name? 
Answer: 
Thea Marguerita Va
leria Sacca Rips. 
Q: And when were you born
 and where were you born ? 
A: I was born in
 Trieste 
on February 24, 1922. 
Q: Tell me a little bit about your family
, how long they 
had been there. 
A: Here in the 
United States
, you mean?  
Q: No, how long th
ey had been in 
Trieste
. 
A: Well, in 
Trieste
 from ™22 to ™27, because my fa
ther was work ing -- he was an 
engineer, electrical engineer, and he 
was working with the shipyards in 
Monfalcone. 
And 
when it were -- he was transfers to 
Fiume, 
which now is 
Rijeka
. We moved to 
Fiume 
when
 
I was about five years old. And we lived in 
Fiume 
until 1945, until the end of the 
war. And Father worked there, he was a chie
f -- he was the director of the electrical 
department of the shipyard. 
Can-Cantieri Navale del Quarnaro
, where they were 
build ing all kind of ship s, from s
ubmarines, even to the yacht for 
Mussolini
 they built, 
which was never delivered. And he was in char
ge of -- not only of the projects for the 
electrical equipment on the ships,
 but also of the -- care of th
e cranes and all the electrical 
equipment of the shipyard itself. And practic
ally I was born with fascism, grew under

fascism, without realizing -- it wa -- it w -- it
 was normal for -- for 
s -- my life. And we 
went to school. Then they came  when -- when we went to school. Of course, we were all 
supposed  to be 
piccolo Italiani, 
small, little Italians, beca
use otherwise the schools -- 
apparently  we were not able 
to go to school, as far as I know. I never realized that, of 
course. And I went through the whole system 
until I finished the -- what we call senior 
high school. Actually it is the 
Liceo Scientifico,
 
Scientific Lyceum, 
which is practically 
comparable to the -- to here -- 
even though it was only four ye
ar. Four year of junior high 
and four years of senior high. 
The junior high I went to the 
technical institute. The senior 
high I went to the 
Liceo Scientifico
. But as far as educati
on, they told me it™s 
comparable, when you finish 
Liceo
 
Scientific -- Scientifico,
 excuse me, like two years of 
college in this country, because we had 
very thorough, you kn
ow, the education in 
Euro pe
. And that™s it. My father continued to 
work. H-He was never a -- a -- a carda -- a 
card holding fascist. He became -- he had to  
become or -- or -- a member of the fascist 

party in 1942, because otherw
ise he would have lost his 
job and h-he had responsib ilities 
[indecipherable]
. He had trouble because he didn™t 
want to wear the uniform, and he 
never had a unifo rm and he ne
ver wore the black tie -- th e 
-- the black shirt. But you 
know, they were, with
 the exceptions of few fanat -- 
a few -- several fanatics, th e 
population was a stran g e population in 
Fiume
 because they were open-minded on one 
side and fascist on the other side 
because after the first World War, 
Fiume
 was next to 
Italy
 only in 1924, after the famous 
DiNunzio coup. 
Apparently th-the Italians didn™t

want them, but they felt and they are still 
feel f -- extremely Italian, even though the 
population was mixed and the ch  -- the c
ity was occupied by ev erybody, from the 
Espaniards
 to the st -- 
Napoleon, 
th-the 
Venetians.
 It started as an Roman colony and -- 
but they  were always, who knows why, very 
deeply, they felt deeply Italian. And so  
that™s why they accepted 
DiNunzio. 
So  
DiNunzio
 and 
Mussolini, 
even though they 
didn™t like each other very, very
 much, I must say -- for awhile
 they did, but then -- you 
see, they connected their fact th
at they were -- that they coul
d join the Italian, th ey were 
admitted to be Italians betwe -- to 
DiNunzio
 and to 
Mussolini
. So they felt in that fak -- 
ka -- in that sense they felt that they we
re fascists. Fascists because th -- fascism 
permitted them to be Italia
ns, you know? The city was 
[indecipherable]
 after. And that™s 
it. I tell you also another thing, that this c
ity which was extremely w
ealthy, small city, we 
ended up with 45,000 
people, but we were much smaller when I was little, had many 
plans, many industries. It had the torpedo pl
ant, it had th-the shipyards, it had the oil 
refinery. It had heavy machin
ery plant, it had mills, and it -- ab-absolutely everything, 
and the population, the 
workers were very well off. They 
had nice houses
, we were going 
skiing togeth er at the engineers -- th-th-th-the 
director, with the son 
of th-the -- th-th-th-
th-the -- of -- of everybody. We were really
 a str -- strong community. We were playing 
tennis together with the children of the work
ers and so on. So much so that we had a 
limited number of poor, who were known all 
by name, you see. And th ere was a very 
important Jewish community, 
Ashkenazi
, coming from the east, from the 
Balkans
, from

Germany
. I don™t think there was a single Sephard ic
 Jew, as far as I can remember. And 
we had in
 Villa Firenze
 where we lived, among the othe
r places, just across of it, a 
beautiful, beautiful, three domed 
synagogue with the cupolas co
vered with copper tiles. It 
was really beautiful. And livin
g across the street from them, you see -- we were always 
saying, oh, d -- you know, they  
were th-the -- the real Orth
odox Jews, the 
one with the 
curls and the -- and the fur k -- and the hats w
ith the fur around it, you see. And we were 
s -- and -- and th ey were telling us, you know 
-- we were children, we were -- we were 
actually not so much children al-already, they
 were saying, oh well we cou -- we cannot 
go in there, we cannot go in there, because you know, we -- they don™t allow us to go 

there and who knows what™s go
ing on there? But I never heard about -- people talking 
about blood sacrifices or things like th
is because they were -- we were so 
interwined
 that 
even then there were not many,
 but there were several mixe
d marriages at the time. And 
in my  case, for instance, I found -- I found 
out that some of my  schoolmates in -- in 
school were Jewish because th
ey were allowed, on the Sabba
th -- because at th e time we 
were going to school also on s -- on Saturd ay
 -- on the Sabbath  they
 were not going to 
school, but they were justified. They were 
allowed not to come, because until the racial 
laws were applied, unfortuna
tely, there was no problem. And 
-- and -- and -- and we were 
going -- Jewish kids and non-Jewi
sh kids and Protestant kids
, we were all together, we 
couldn™t care less about religion, o-or wherev
er they were coming from. And that was it. 
So, what did I say? And I rememb er, of all th
ese other people, there was a -- a v -- a very

interesting man, a -- a Jew, Mr. 
Ta nnenbaum
, ma -- mister -- well fa -- probably Mr. 
Tannenbaum
, for us he™s -- it lo oked like -- like a -- 
like a priest or something, because 
[indecipherable]
 we know, with the black caftan and 
the hat with the fur around. He was 
the sweetest man in the world.
 My father knew him well. He didn™t come to our house 
often, but he was going around the house of
 people he knew, he was friendly. He was 
collecting money for charities. B u t charities not
 for the Jewish popu
lation, for everybody 
who was born in town. He was well known for th
at. Then, of course, he disappeared. Life 
was very co mfortable in 
Fium e
, very comfortable. Every 
year we were going to a 
[speaks Italian here]
. And th-there I me t a-another group 
of -- I had this group of Jewish 
friends tha -- the 
Lagers, Bondy 
and 
Ka th y Lager
, his bra -- his cousin , and we were all 
having fun going to  the ocean together 
[indecipherable]
 this or that. And I remember 
they were already on guard in the sense th
at while we kind of ignored the mu sics from 
America
, jazz, the 
[in d ecipherable]
 they already heard, may-maybe because they had 
relatives here or something, I don™t know fo
r sure. But anyhow, they
 were bringing this 
music and we learned jazz through these Jewi
sh friends of ours, you know. They were 
really fantastic. I remember that 
Bondy Lager
 was very much in lo
ve with me. An-And I 
met 
Bondy 
when I first came here in ™55, and he
 was married to an
 Austrian girl -- 
Jewish girl, and he had a child. And we met in -- in 
New York
 wh ere he had a plant or -- 
or -- or a store -- o-of t-toys for -- and it 
-- it was very emotional, you know. After so 
many years, you know I call, who™s there? He says, 
B-Bondy™s 
there. Also because when

Bondy 
escaped from 
Fiume
 in -- just as -- w ith the last boat which left
 Naple
, it must 
have been 1940, his 
parents remained in 
Fium e
. They  were merchants and they had a 
deposit with they had all kind 
of food, the potatoes, all k i
nd of thing. Th-T he parents 
remained in 
Fium e
, but 
Bondy
 and his sister came to the 
States
. And they left from 
Naples.
 And when they left 
Fiume
 by train to go to 
Naples
, my si ster and myself went to 
the train to say goodbye. And th
e funny thing is that since at that time I was young and I 
had many boys at the same time growing arou
nd me, my sister was saying, you know, yi 
-- there is like a -- like a-a -- a 
torta
, a -- a cake. All the flie
s go to hel -- you know? So 
that when 
Bondy 
was writing to me, he was saying lo t of love to the 
torta
, you know 
[indecipherable]
. Well, that was the story of 
Bondy
. His -- his cousin went to 
Milan
, h-
he™s -- hid in 
Milan, 
the -- 
Lazi,
 b ecause they were of 
Hungarian descent, that 
Lazi -- 
Ladizlow
, and -- and he was all right. Then
 what happened 
with this? The 
anschluss
, 
yes, there™s -- now we come to the 
real s -- thing, which is important. 
Q: Let -- let me just ask you some 
questions before we get to that. 
A: Yes. 
Q: You say you had it -- you have a si
ster ti -- and what is her name? 
A: My sister name is 
Laura
 and she is five years younger than I am. And f -- wh-while 
we were in 
Fiume
, more or less we shared our life, but being five years younger, you 
know, she had -- at that mo ment she had her 
group and I had my  grou
p. We were always 
together because we were hikers and sk iers
 and we were going ever
y f -- every weekend -

- weekend -- every Sunday of ev
ery festivity. We -- Father intr
oduced us to the love of 
nature and -- a-an-and -- and mo untains and th
ing. We were going skiing or hiking. And 
she was very funny, they loved 
her very much, so mu
ch so that when I 
f-finished the -- ha 
-- the 
Lyceum
, the senior high and there was the pa
rty, she was invited too, because she 
was so funny, and sh -- and so agile that 
she was making herself a ball, and they were 
throwing her like one. It was -- sh e -- sh
e™s still a funny character, I must say. 
Unfortunately she cannot be a ball any more
, but she is still go to the -- to the gym. 
Q: What are your parent™s names? 
A: My father is 
Giorgio 
and  my  mo th er was 
Emma Pacore. 
Because my  father parents 
were -- are -- well, my g
r-grandmother from my fath
er™s side was born in  
Co urtsela
, and 
my  grandfather was born in 
Montenegro, 
in  
Corta
, but they lived always in 
Trieste
. My 
grandfather was a purser or 
[indecipherable]
 there is a special name, it™s 
[speaks 
Italian]
 which is the assistant purser, but one who is
 in charge of buying all the material 
f-f-food, everything for the ships,
 for the liners of the Austrian
 Lloyd,
 which later on 
became 
Lloyd Ad riatico
. No, first I think it was 
Lloyd Triestino, 
and then  
Lloyd 
Adriatico.
 And he traveled a lot to the Orient
, so much so that the house of my 
grandparents had a lot of Oriental stuff, whic
h like stupid we broke, 
and not only if we 
had not broken, we had to leav
e there when we escaped as 
refugees, so it was all lost. 
And my -- and his mother -- I -- w e -- I have
 the documents, but I don™t remember -- I 

don™t know where she was born, but she was It
alian speaking and German speaking, and

she had th ree sons. My grandfather was the y
oungest one, and when
 her husband died -- 
and I don™t know what her husband did, which I think he was making bottles, wine 
bottles. He had the plant where he was maki
ng wine bottles. And she was a -- she didn™t 
finish school. When  my  grandfather -- great gr
andfather died, on my  
father™s side, she c -
- finished her school, she became a teache
r, and I still have the documents where she 
writes to the Austrian, to 
Vienna
, to have th e permission to teach in a school for girls, 
you know? But ever
ything written in 
Italia
. When 
Mussolini
, as soon as he took over, 
forbade the people of our area -- 
we™re in -- th-the interland of 
Fium e
 was Slav, Croatian 
and 
[indecipherable]
 
Trieste
 Slav, Sloven ian, he forb ad e them to use their language, he 
made them change their names, and he was stupid, wh ile 
Franz Josef
 was sma rt enough 
to let each -- each nationality to use their own 
language and si -- that™s why we lost that, 
kind of, because if he had be
en more intelligent, I will spea
k Croatian, which I love, and -
- and they wouldn™t ha -- we -- w e wouldn™t
 have made enemies. In stead, they were 
enemies. O f course, they forc ed to -- to -- to use a languag e -- the old people wer -- never 

could speak Italian, so -- 
Q: Mm-hm. And -- and 
Fium e
 is a -- a city on the -- on the 
Adriatic, 
a port city on the 
Adriatic -- 
A: Oh 
[indecipherable]
 yes, it™s right, you know, with th e eastern peninsula on one side, 
you know, there is like 
a triangle. There is 
Trieste
. Then, at the tip of the triangle is 
Paola
, or 
Pula 
as they call it now, and then it™s 
Fiume
 on the other side that -- of -- and 

 
Interview with TheaRips

we -- now it™s called 
Rijeka
, which means 
Fiume
 too, beca -- also in 
Russia, Rijeka 
is 
-- 
Rijeka
 is
 Fiume
. And then immediately there is 
the Dalmatian coast and along the 
Dalmatian coast, amo ng the islands is the 
island where my  grandmother was born. And 
my  grandmother was speaking German, of cour
se, Croatian and Italia
n. So did my  cra -- 
grandfather. So that™s it. 
Q: You have one sister
, do you have any other 
sisters or brothers? 
A: No, no, no, only one sister. 
Q: Now you say you were born in 1922. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: When  a man named 
Hitler 
came into power in 1933, 
did you hear of him then? 
A: Well, you know, we kids, we couldn™t care
 less about politics, you know. I think this 

is typical. Maybe now may -- maybe now ki
ds follow more, but 
I know more about 
ancient history than the history that I lived 
through. Now I remember, now I start to -- to 
give importance to the facts, you know, but 
I went thro ugh th e war in -- Span ish war, 
when  -- when we had the 
Franco
, that was a very good chan
ce to go and take a day 
vacation because we were going demonstr
ating against this, or -- or when the 
[indecipherable]
 to go demonstrate on the British co
nsulate. You know, it was -- in the 
meantime we didn™t know -- we™re
 not going to school. We didn
't even know what we are 
doing, it was just having fun, you kn
ow. And as our famous journalist 
Indro Montanelli
, 
who is now -- now dead 
[indecipherable]
 said, you know, who cared about fascism or

anything until things happened
? We were young. We didn™t th ink, we -- we didn™t -- we 
didn™t s -- we didn™t suffer. We didn™t fo
llow th-the -- all the stories so much 
[indecipherable]
 this and that. Father, yes, probabl
y, but in my  home we never spoke 
about politics, never. Father was a rather -- ra
ther closed character, and I think that we 
[indecipherable]
 never discussed politics. They just di
dn™t agree, they did what they had 
to do, their job. They didn™
t participate to the famous 
[indecipherable]
 reunions, every ti 
-- ev-every -- every Satu
rday. They didn™t -- th
ey were just -- I me
an , an-and they were 
not disturbed, they -- they could live their life. 
Q: How religious was your family? 

A: Catholic. I was bor -- bap
tized -- born and baptized in
 Trieste
 in the famous 
San 
Giusto [indecipherable]
 church, you know, Roman -- beautiful Ro manic church, yeah. 
Q: So, up to the time of the 
anschluss
 -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- you had Jewish friends, you 
were comfortable with them -- 
A: Oh, very. 

Q: -- you played with them? 

A: Oh well, of course. Th-They™ve -- then, actu
ally only after a -- a f -- I must say, after 
the 
anschluss
 and then in ™38 the ration laws came
 about, we realized that there were 
Jews and non-Jews. And 
we were -- I -- I --

Q: These are racial laws in 
Fiume
? 
A: In da -- always in 
Fiume
, yes, because we didn™t move from 
Fiume
 until the end of 
the war. A-And -- 
Q: What -- what were some of the restrictions? 
A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: What were some of the restrictions of the racial laws? 

A: Well, they were supposed 
not to have maids. The ki 
-- the girls couldn™t come to 
school, but the professor, for quite a long time , kept an eye closed and the kids were 

coming to school just the same. 

Q: Right. 
A: Then, when they rea
lized it, th ey started to be the -- 
th-the worst part started  when the 
Germans took over, because un
til 1943, when the ger -- when
, after the armistice, the 
Germans occupied the area, a
nd it was the only area of 
Italy
 which was incorporated into 
Germany
. At that time we became part of 
Germany. 
And th at when  the real trouble 
started. 
Q: A -- but up to that time, did you still have
 close contact with your Jewish friends?  
A: Yes, because after the 
anschluss
, we had these -- well, in 
the same building was living 
an engineer fa -- naval engineer wo rking 
[indecipherable]
 a friend of Father, working in 
the same sh ipyard 
[indecipherable] Fierst, B runo Fierst.
 Then there was the fa -- the 
Weiss
 family, Jewish. The daughter married a Catholic boy, 
a -- the brother of a friend of

mine. She was studying piano, she was playing 
beautifully. On  the groun -- on the first 
floor was living -- were living the 
Moscovitz. 
The 
Mo scovitz
 had a beautiful -- kind of 
hardware store, but they were selling toys and everything. And every Christmas 
[indecipherable]
 it was a two story thing, you know,
 and it was on the wa -- in the -- o-
on one of the main s-squares of 
Fiume
, and they had on that 
-- on the second floor, an 
enormous window and there was appearing a 
Santa Claus
, and showing -- and -- and th e 
children, we were all on the street, you know,
 watching what was 
going on, and -- and he 
was showing the 
[indecipherable]
 and the children, to me, 
to me, to me, to me, you 
know, and these were the 
Mo sco vit z
™
, 
you know? And they were very  nice. Sh e was a 
very lovely little girl -- little woman, bu-but
 -- but he was even funnier because he was 
very, very  short and very, very, very prim 
all the time, y ou know? But wonderful people, 
and they  all had the 
m e zu za h ,  
th-the 
m e zu za h
 on the their door, so what? You know, 
they 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did they ever confide in you
 that they were con -- or -- 
or -- your Jewish friends ever 
confid e in you that they  were
 concerned or frightened ?  
A: Until ™43, no, they were not
 very -- they -- they didn™t 
like the idea. Many were smart 
enough, many -- I don™t know how many p -- but
 several left. But these friends, close 
friends of ours who were living in the sa
me b u ilding, they di
dn™t. Then the -- the 
Weiss
 
left first. T h en the 
Moscovitz
 left. They had a maid, the 
Moscovitz,
 
Paula -- Paola
, 
Catholic. And when they left, 
they left the apartment, they
 were in the way it was. But 

 
Interview with TheaRips

13
even -- yes, there it was with the 
m e zu za h  
on the door. They  only gave
 us to save, to put 
aside for them, an enormous po
rtrait, natural size, of Mr. 
Moscovitz
, which we hid 
behind a -- a -- an armoire we had, you know? 
[indecipherable]
 okay. And when the 
Germans came th-there, that apartment, th-the
 maid was there -- oh sorry -- that the maid 
was there, and they occupi
ed the apartment of the 
Mo scovitz.
 They  saw the 
m e zu za h
, 
they could even -- th
ey couldn™t care less. They were there, 
Paola
 remained to take care 
of them. They were too old, and one was 
Rudy  Buko v itz
, a comman d er. The other one I 
don™t rememb er, he was not -- a-and they  were stationed at the shipyard  wh ere my  father 
was working, you know, because
 they -- with the ships. An
d the -- and the sh ipyard was 
supposed  then to repair damaged ships wh
ich were coming i-in port, Germans, si -- 
Italian. 

Q: We™re talking now April 1941, is
 that what you™re thinking of? 
A: Ah, no, this is -- th
is was in ™43. With 
[indecipherable].
 I mix up th e dates because 
they are difference -- different people, different stories, you see. This was in ™43 wh en 
they came. And I know 
that, for instance, the 
[indecipherable]
 the tanks -- we were 
leaving in  a very w-wide av
enue, you know, and they  were
 coming with the tanks and 
they stopped under our building. And si
nce they were livin
g in what we call 
mezzanino, 
which is not really the first 
floor. Here is called first floor, but you have a few steps up 
and there™s the doors, you know? And the 
Mo scov itz™
 w ere li-living -- I mean, on the 
mezzanino, 
and the soldiers knocked at their doo
r, asked for water, they gave them do --

water. Then they gave them br
eakfast and tha-that was it. Th
e soldiers didn™t even di -- 
bother them at all, and -- and th en
 they went away
. Then finally 
Bukitz,
 they took this 
apartment and the 
Mo scovitz™
 went to 
Venice
 and then they were 
-- they went -- they 
were -- they took refuge in the island of 
Sa int George, San Giorgio 
is one of these 
islands around 
Venice
. And there was a kind of a sanitarium
 or a fi -- a psychiatric thing, 
and -- and they hid there during a
ll the period of the war. Well, if I h ave to continue about 
the 
Moscovitz
™, then he died, and then I saw Mrs. 
Moscovitz
 when she went to 
Milan, 
a-
after the war sh-she was there. An-And -- a
nd I think that there she was f -- living in 
Milan
, and across her apartment, there was an
 apartment where there was a couple, I 
don™t remember the name because I met 
them only that time, a young couple whose 
husband of the man and wife -- the wife of 
the man and the husban d of the young woman 
died in concentration camp. Th
ey met in concentration camp
, they got married and they 
had a little daughter. And I was there just for 
Passover. I didn™t know what was Passover. 
And so I invite -- I was sleeping at Mrs. 
Moscovitz
, so we went for -- for the passo -- the 
ne -- we were the five of us, it was my firs
t Passover, you know? And 
th ey did explain to 
me, and this little girl, she said
 di -- when she had to tell the story of Passover, she said 
and then the 
carabinieri 
came. The ca -- the 
carabinieri 
with the 
[indecipherable]
 you 
know. Think it was really cute. And -- and that
 was it. So -- but then I didn™t see Mrs. 
Moscovitz
 any mo re ag ain. I heard th
at she died. These are the

Weiss,

Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with
 Thea Sacca Rips
. This is tape number one, side
 B
, and you 
began -- you had begun to tell the story of this family. 
A: So th ey arrived, and they found an apar
tment. It was a beautiful apartment building 
near the station an -- and th e tennis courts. And th ere were only tw o apartments per 
building -- per -- per floor. We were on the fifth floor. 
Q: And when was this? 
A: 19 -- after -- immed iately after the 
anschluss
, what was -- what year was -- 
Q: So it was spring, 1938? 

A: 1938, yes. They arrived -- we were fla
bbergasted, because they were, all of them, 
about two fee -- two -- two meter of tall -- one
 meter -- two meter tall. He was a very 
elegant gentleman, you know, very well 
dressed. She was a beautiful wo man. 
Q: Wh-Where had they come from? 
A: From
 Vienna
, as far as I remember, 
and then they  had son,
 Anto n, 
called
 Tondo 
in 
[indecipherable]
 he™s always been  
To ndo .  
And I think that he was from very wealthy 
family in 
Vienna
. I think that they were 
[indecipherable]
 special wines were --

expensive, gourmet food. As fa
r as I think -- v-vaguely  this -- I -- we never investigated 
what they  were doing or something, and -- y
ou know. And we started to talk, wi -- you 
know, th-the balcony, which was giving on 
th e tennis courts, it was the balcony of our 
kitchen, and by the balcony of th eir kitche
n was just looking as -- an -- by us, to our 
balcony. So we -- I was already -- well,
 in ™38, I was already 16 year old 
[indecipherable]
 something, and my  sister was 12. 
To ndo
 was the age of -- o-of my  
sister,  and we started t o  talk 
[indecipherable]
 soon from the balcony and then  we 
became friends, we were 
[indecipherable]
 with the parents, and then that was it. And 
they were at four -- ended ‚43. We became 
very close. When , in ™43, the Germans took 
over our area, after the armistice, immediat
ely  after September eight, we, at that time 
were h-having our -- spending ou
r vacation at the seashore in 
Lowranna, 
or
 Lovranna
 
now, in 
Notelle
. And we™ve, unfortunately saw them
 arriving, th e soldiers, how would 
you say? Making pee pee, you know, on th
e street, you know. Walking whi -- wh i-wh ile 
they were walking, going like th
is. Then we her -- we heard shots. They shot a couple of 
partisans who were already read
y there, and they didn™t le
t anybody to go near them. 
There was one in the orchard an
d we can -- nobody can go -- can 
go there to take care of 
this person, and so on. And so, 
since we didn™t feel safe in 
the hotel, there was -- there 
were some Croatian friends who had a villa
, which once belonged to one of the 
archdukes, because that area 
was very famous during the Au
stro-Hungarian empire. They 
were keeping their -- their mistresses and th
ey were spending th eir vacation there, and 

 
Interview with TheaRips

17
this kind of thing. And we went to stay 
with them, eating only sa
rdines and potatoes, 
okay, that was it. And the
 Schtitzel
 were also vacationing in  th
e same place, and th ey got 
extremely scared, of course. And they -- they 
found a -- a f -- a fisherman, who took them 
by boat to 
Yugoslavia
, to the -- to the 
Dalm atia
 actually, to the other coast. They were 
hoping to be able to reach, pr
obably -- I don™t know, southern 
Italy. 
And I remember that 
they gave us a bag with the jewelry and -- 
and the -- and the key to
 the apartment. The 
only thing sh e took with -- no -- they took 
the jewelry with them, giving a -- and -- and 
they went there. Then
 they came back from 
Yugoslavia
 an d  th ey  came 
to the apartment 
because they felt safe, an-and
 they were safe, nobody bot
hered them. But th-the -- we 
know -- nobody knew fo
r how long they would have been
 safe, so they wanted to go 
away. And they got in touch 
with the police commissioner, w
ho probably  is on the -- how 
do you say, the roll of the ju
st or whatever it is in 
Jerusalem, Panicucci
 was the -- the 
commissioner. One was 
[indecipherable]
 the name, they made a sort of film about him. 
The -- 
Q: 
Schindler,
 you mean? 
A: No, no, no, no, th e -- the commissioner, th
e -- th-they made a -- the documentary, that 
-- that it was even show
n on th  -- a couple of weeks ago in
 the Jewish thing. The last one 
was about the one who was also
 killed afterwards, who gave her passports to the Jews, 
and so on, but 
Panicucci 
was -- 
Q: 
Wallenberg -- Raoul Wallenberg?

A: No, no, no, no, no,
 no. In  Italian. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: And 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: 
Per-Perlaska? 
A: 
Perlaska, Perlaska. 
They -- 
Panicucci 
was th e 
Perlaska
 of our area. And so 
apparently  he gave them -- yeah, and he
 gave them papers with another name, 
Sardi,
 and 
th-the Franciscans fath er of the church of sa -- of 
San Geron -- Geronim -- Geronimo™s 
church  gave them birth certificates, Catholic 
[indecipherable]
. But they fact is that i-in -- 
in the -- between ™38 to ™43, 
To ndo
 became a big boy. They were -- in 
Fium e
, everybody 
knew them because they  were so visible,
 you know, tall, handsome, they see all 
[indecipherable]
 of them going, you know? So, they  
were -- th-they went to f -- they 
went to flo -- to the -- 
they wanted to go to  
Venice,
 but how do we go to 
Venice
? 
Everybody knows us, somebody
 meet you on the train, and if we have different 
documents, the Germans were going up 
and down the train. Okay, we -- 
Thea
 can take 
the -- the -- the documents for you, but -- but 
you le -- so they le
ft with the f-forged 
documents on th e train, and on the same train,
 like an idiot, I was 
on the same train as 
they were o-on with their real
 documents. So -- but we prete
nded not to know each other. 
I was sitting in one -- I -- I was sitting on one
 side, in one compartment, they were sitting 
on th e other. And th en, you know, 
we were in different are -- 
Tondo
 and I went on th e 
corridor, we started to talk like two people w
ho ju st meet, you know, it wa -- it was really

something. They  were no trouble. In the mean
time we had told to my
 sist -- my aunt -- 
my mother™s sister, who was living in 
Trieste
, that they were coming,
 to please -- she s -- 
since she had the large apartment, not many 
beds, but a large apartment, an enormous 
living room, dining room, larger th an this 
one, to arrange for them to spend the night 
there, because the next da
y they were going to -- to 
Venice
. So when they arrived, we 
went to the house of my  aunt, she had arrang
ed some mats on the fl
oor an-and we slept 
there. And the next day they went to 
Venice
. Their new names were 
Sardi.
 They were no 
mo re 
Schtitze l, 
they were
 Sardi,
 and they went to live for awh
ile in hotel. But, of course
, 
Venice
 and 
Fiume
 are pretty close and they were
 afraid that some people from 
Fiume
 
would recognize them there, or 
[indecipherable]
. And I remember that
 even I went once 
to visit with them -- o-or es -- yes, before 
leaving they gave us th
eir jewelry, and there 
was another family too, in 
Abbazia,
 where they left a tru nk, wh
ere she left her fur coats. 
I don™t know what was there because we ne
ver saw the trunk and we never saw that 
family. And I don™t know if -- how the stuff sh
e gave them left. We -- they left in the 
apartment only some wine, some fo
od that he had put aside, Mr. 
Schtitze l
. B u t they gave 
us the jewelry, and she took 
only a beautiful diamond ring 
sh e had, she took with her. 
And they went to -- as I say, they went to 
Venice. 
I went to visit with them and by 
mistake I k nocked at the door and I said, Mr. 
Schtitzel
. The poor man was scared -- was 
scared to death, but I did -- you know, it win 
-- I-I -- without thinking.
 He was so scared. 
Anyhow, from there 
they moved to 
Milan
 where this engineer, 
Fierst, 
who was th -- 

 
Interview with TheaRips 
 
 
January 20, 2004

working my -- with my father had found re
fuge in a -- in an apartment building in 
Mila n
, 
where many Jews were living we -- under ma
 -- different names, and they moved in 
there. The 
portieri 
knew about them, everybody kne
w who they  were, but nothing 
happened. But the fact is th
at -- came that time that 
To ndo
 had the age to be called into 
the army. And th -- Mr. 
Schtitzel
, 
Arnold
, got so scared that he -- I don™t know th rough 
whom, thi-this we heard later wa
 -- from -- from th e sh -- from the 
Fierst 
who told them, 
don™t do that, don™t do that, they might not ca ll him. Hide the boy, don™t do it. Instead, 
no, no, no, no, we go to 
Switzerland
, we go to 
Switzerland
, we go to 
Switze rland
. And 
the guys who were supposed to  take them 
across the border apparently betray ed them, 
and -- and that was it. For a long time we
 didn™t hear anything. The war was over. 
Tito
 
occupied our area. And one day a nice gentlema
n knocks at our door. And he says, I am 
so and so  and so . I am the head 
of the Jewish community here in 
Fium e
. I know that you 
helped the -- the 
Schtitze ls
 and that the 
Schtitzels
 gave you so me jewelry, so on. Oh , 
says, thank goodness. So we 
gave to him -- he -- of course he -- he demonstrated 
[indecipherable]
 and we gave the jewels to him a-a
nd then we didn™t hear from him any 
more, but I™m -- it -- I™m sure -- h o w -- how else
 could he know if -- if they had not told 
him? We trusted him immediat
ely and we gave him back th
e jewels. She had -- she had 
hidden her diamond in her rectum when  she 
was traveling and of course they  found it, 
you know, because there -- they
 were examining a-abso lutely
 everything. And so  -- and

this man told us that 
To ndo
 and her -- and the father died in 
Auschwit z
 and, which is 
even more terrible, 
Nellie, 
the mother, was sick and sh
e was killed by the dogs.  
Q: Oh, no. Hm.  
A: They were chasing after her and they -- an
d she died like this. In
 the meantime, they 
had left with us the address of
 her brother, who was living in  
New York, Otto Weiss. 
And I started to correspond -- as soon as I 
heard this, I wrote to him also, telling him 
about the jewels and telling him about the few 
things that they left with us, a -- a -- a 
silver box, because Mr. 
Schtitzel
, during the first World Wa
rs, was a officer in the 
Austrian army . And the box he left with us was a box that he received from his 
comp anio ns, I don™t know in what occasion, 
with all the signatures of his companions. 
And we have a photograph 
of the group of Austrian officers, and he is there, y ou see? It 
was -- it -- and so I wrote to Uncle
 Otto
 in English, with my poor
 English, but I managed. 
No, I -- I a -- at the time I was speaking
 some German, I don™t know whether it was 
German or English, I mixed up things. I s
till have the correspondence, it™s home. And so 
he said well, that to give certain things to 
-- to -- to I don™t know who it was, and to keep 
the rest for us, it was a -- 
the -- th-the -- took the 
[indecipherable]
. And -- and that was 
it. And that was the end o-o-of the 
Schtitzel
. And to us it was just 
like losing family, and 
-- and to hear that they went 
like that was really terrible. I 
kept corresponding with Uncle
 
Otto
, who was sending us care packages, because under 
Tito
 it was much worse than 
during th e war. That was the wors
t part of -- for us, because 
Fium e
 was bomb ed only by 

 
Interview with TheaRips 
 
 
January 20, 2004 
 

 
 
22
-- by the -- but when the British were bombing, 
where they were comi
ng only with the s -
- small planes, with the
 Sp-Spitfires, 
you know, and th ey were -- si
nce all the -- th-the -- 
the big in dustries were along th e coast, they
 were not touching th e city. They  were going 
ba -- th -- shooting at whatever the equipm
ent they had there. But th-then the -- the 
Americans came and then they bombed also the city
, so much so that where we were -- 
no, we had shelters since ther
e is the mountain behind th 
-- we are on the ocean and -- th-
the sea and the mo untain and th e shelters were under the mountain. And wh en th e 
Germans were there, in the -- in
 the -- a-and they occupied th
e shipyard, part of the he -- 
lighter work s were hidden un
der the rocks under the mountai
ns and so that -- and also, 
near our home there was a shelter under th-the 
hills, so that we were safe in there. And 
during th at time, they were 
recruiting the Germ -- the G erm
ans -- this is -- this has 
nothing to -- the 
Schtitze l
 were already away, but at that 
time, yes, we were still -- there 
were still Jews, men -- several Jews in 
Fiume
. Among them were the two 
Farcas 
brother, 
Rudy
 and -- 
Rudy
 and 
Paolo
. 
Rudy 
was the youngest one, a little b it light-headed, 
simp le, very, very pleasant boy. And 
Paolo, 
who was helping my sister with her Latin, 
you know. And the ta -- the tim
e came that -- when th-the
 -- the Germans started to 
recruit the young people to work  -- the famous 
[indecipherable]
 organization, you know, 
to build a -- fortresses to -- to -- to build  fo
r them things all along the border because we 
were right on the border with the Yugo
slavs, you know? An
d we were saying, 
Paolo
 and 
Rudy
, 
Paolo
, go away, go away, go aw
ay. Why do you stay here
, why do you stay here?

And they said no, but there is 
no, we are working there, they 
are kind to us, they are nice. 
We are not only Jews there, they were recr
uiting everybody, you know. And he said, no, 
no, he said, we stay. Then one
 day they took away 
their parents, and they said co -- and 
they took them to 
Trieste
, to the only concen tration camp  that th-the Germans made in 
Trieste
, the famous rice factory, you know, the risia --
 Risiera
 where they -- well, they di 
-- I don™t know wh a-wh at they did to them, th
ey burned  them or the wa -- I had -- I had 
no id ea what -- what was going on. The 
Risiera
 now is the national monument in tr -- in 
Trieste, 
you know. A me-me -- a memorial. And 
we were telling them, go away, go 
away. No, no, no. When, after th
e parents were sent we™d say, but now you better go. No, 
no, no, no, no, no, no. In the 
meantime a lso, my sist
er and my self were recruited and my  
sister became a welder. Be si
 -- since Father was working at
 the shipyard , he immediately 
put them to work  there. I was studying to be 
a doctor, so I was in the infirmary, and I was 
there helping th e doctor, giving in jections 
for -- for all kind of 
people, you know? And 
my sister was a welder for th
e ships, you know? And -- and th
e funny thing is that they 
were repairing the -- one of the -- I think it was a cruiser, I don™t rem -- I don™t know th e 
name, the American names of the ships, but
 anyhow, wh ich had been damaged, and the 

work was not -- never proceed
ing because the workers were
 working and 
undoing. Doing 
and undoing so that the Germans couldn™t get 
it, you know? Bu t finally they had to do it, 
and they -- because the Germans started to
 -- so, it was completed, and they went 
[indecipherable]
 to test, they were only -- but they 
were only the workers, Italian, that 

 
Interview with TheaRips

24
they f -- workers. My father was on board, ever
ybody. They went to se
a, they tested, they 
came back, everything was perfect. The first ti
me that the Germans we
nt at sea with the 
[indecipherable]
 with the cruiser or whatever name 
it is, all at once we were standing on 
-- in -- looking at the -- at that ship, because
 working there both of us, we were there at 
the shipyard with Father. All 
at o n ce from -- it was a sk y like 
this one with 
broken clouds 
and sun, out of the clouds, 
Spitsfires
 started to comes. They knew that there were only 
Germans on board, so there must ha
ve been, you know, something. And 
vroom, vroom, 
vroom, vroom
, they came back to the 
shipyard, you know, with wounded people and so 
and so. That was it. Then th ey bombed of course the -- th
e -- the -- the shipyard, the 
Americans who were in there. 
We were able to go undergrou
nd, in -- under the -- th-the 
rocks. Then, when th e bombard ment was over, 
they brought some soldiers which were -- 
had been there 
[indecipherable]
 the German soldiers, I 
rememb er I had to give 
morphium
 to whoever there was very heavily wo und
ed, the -- he broke a -- he lost a leg, 
but I remember he was there. We were -- we 
were two -- there were the -- the -- the -- the 
real nurse, then -- it was a man, th e doctor an
d my self, and we had really to work, you 
know, 
[indecipherable]
 
morphium
 
Schwester, morphium Schwester, 
because he was 
in terrible pain. His hand was comp letely
 open, like this, you know. I gave him 
morphium
 and then they took him to
 the hospital. I heard that day he lost a leg, this 
soldier. And so the 
Farcas
 brothers were still there and one morning, it was a S u nday, we 
wake up and we could see the synagogue fro
m our building, because it was very opened , 

 
Interview with TheaRips 
 
 
January 20, 2004 
 

 
 
25
and we see f-fire. We said, Go
d gracious, that™s the synagogu
e. So my sister and I got 
dressed. Father and Mo ther didn™t even dream 
to say no, don™t go. It was naturally for us, 
we all -- we went to there and 
the fra -- th-the -- the synagogue
 
was as fa -- afire. And 
there he -- who was, 
Paolo
 and 
Rudy
 
Farcas
, who said, go away , go
 away. He says to 
[indecipherable]
 if the Germans see that you are with 
us, he said, you are in danger, go 
away. We said my -- no, don™t -- when -- we  didn™t go away. We were there crying, 
crying, crying. You should have seen that 
synagogue, it was so beautiful. And -- but we 
se -- an-and they didn™t let the firemen to go a
nd take care of the fire. It was a terrible 
day. It was in ™43 when they 
burned th-the synagogue, those 
[indecipherable]
 th-th-the -- 
the 
[indecipherable]
. And that was it. And of course, after awhile 
Rudy
 and 
Farcas 
[indecipherable] Rudy 
an-and -- and -- and -- and 
Paolo
 didn™t appear any more. They 
were taken and we don™t know
 how -- what, we don™t know
. We can imagine how they 
end up. So that 
[indecipherable]
. I think that™s as far as o u r experience with 
[indecipherable]
. That™s all that I can remember. 
Q: When  you were on the train 
carrying those false papers fo
r -- I mean, carrying the true 
papers -- 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- were da -- were you questioned at all? 
Were there any -- wa-was there any incident 
where you had to make up a story? 

 
Interview with TheaRips 
 
 
January 20, 2004 
 

 
 
26
A: No. No. There were -- I was a -- 
I were just a passenger, period. I -- 
[indecipherable]
 
and I was afra -- I was not afraid, I was not wo
rried. My parents sent me like nothing, you 
know, it™s -- we didn™t think of the danger, 
actually. I don™t know why, because we were 
really -- it -- it was n -- to -- to us it was nor
mal to -- to -- to do th
at, you know. That was 
it. A-And also for my aunt to give them ref
uge there for -- that night and -- and also the 
people in -- in -- i-i-in 
Milan
, if 
Arno ld
 wouldn™t have been so a
fraid for -- for -- for his 
son, probably nothing woul
d have happened , because 
Fierst
 came back, went to work in 
Genoa
 after the war, and, you know. 
Q: The fi -- the first names of the 
Schtikless
 parents was 
Arnold -- 
A: 
Arnold,
 and she was 
Nellie W eiss, Nellie Weiss. 
But they -- they were adorable 
people, so nice, so nice. And when  I ca
me here, I tried to get in touch with 
Otto Weiss
 
and I was not able to find it. Maybe either
 he had died, or the comp any was no mo re 
there, or something. Bu t I have the correspondence with  Uncle
 Otto
 and he actually -- his 
is the one who told  -- who wrote to me that he had -- tha-that 
Nellie
 was killed that 
horrible way, you know. 
Q: When  the synagogue was burning, what about
 the rest of the peop
le in the town, or 
other people, were they horrified? 
A: The -- the people were rea
lly hor-horrified -- horrified, 
but you know, probably there 
were some fanatics who were 
really happy, you know, like always, but no, the people 
were really -- I tell you, until -- it was until ™4
3 that -- that they we
re living peacefully.

Then we did -- then the Germ
ans came, then there was th
e -- of course, the ones who 
were just accusing people for -- for re
-revenge, which happened also when 
Tito
 took 
over, they  had just to say, well, that was a fasc
ist, even if he had not been ever, he said, 
and they killed several people of ours, a
nd -- with nothing to do. It wa -- under 
Tito
 it 
was terrible. But under
 Tito
 I was a -- I left in December to
 stay with fr -- just to  pass -- 
spend Christma s with a friend in 
Vald osta
 for -- to go skiing and 
then they arrested th-
they -- th-they -- they 
-- wa -- we call them 
T itini. 
The partisans arrested
 my father as an 
enemy of the people, you kn
ow, because then  it stopped to
 be something like a war, it 
was a -- the Slavs against the Italians. And 
they arrested everybody who was somebody. 
The owner of all the bus lin
es which were going from 
Fiume
 to 
Trieste
 in the area, the 
director of the for -- torpedo plant. Every
body who was somebody. Fo
r awhile they were 
in -- in jail all together, and for awhile 
they had their -- they
 were very worried, 
especially for my father becau se my father, being an engineer, a technician, they were 

lacking personnel but it -- in that
 -- in -- in that field. We 
were afraid the -- because some 
were sent inside 
Yugoslavia
 to -- to work ther
e for them. And instead there were some 
workers who accused Father of mistreatment
. Father was a -- a rabbit like I am. Very 
good on his job, but not -- not a courageous 
person in the sense that -- courageous, yes he 
was, but not -- not to beat people or do these 
things of this kind, 
but you always find one 
who was for one reason or another. And th en 
he was for one month in isolation, and -- 
and that broke my  father. My father had 
never been the same, and if -- it ended --

fortunately it ended peacefully 
in, you know, his own bed wit
hout ever being sick, but he 
was a depressed person for an o -- when  he ca
me I -- i-in the mean
time, I wanted to go 
back to 
Fium e
 because before going, they came to
 have us opting to be Yugoslav or 
Italian. Of course, we all opted 
to be Italian, to go back to 
Italy
, 
[indecipherable]
. And -- 
and I fr -- heard that my father was in pris
on by so me university comp anions who were 
also from 
Fiume
, who came to meet me at the stati
on and they said, oh you know, your 
father is in jail in 
Fiume
. That was the way I heard it. 
So I wanted to run to -- to 
Fium e
. 
And I got, with great difficulty, in touch with
 my  family and they  told me, please don™t 
come because otherwise they cat
ch you too, because you were 
[indecipherable]
 when 
you -- okay. So I started to wo rk . I -- I -- at 
the time I was studying and then  I had to start 
to work, that™s why I -- I am not a doctor, beca

Na ples

Padwa
 and they hire me -- my  English was ju

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with
 Thea  Rips
. This is tape number two, side
 A
, and let™s just talk a 
little bit ab out the end of the war before we 
continue on with your st
ory. What was that 
like for you? 
A: Well, the -- as I said, I was working as a 
nurse in the shipyards, and my sister was a 
welder, but for -- at the time she stopped wo
rking as a welder because she had typhoid 
fever, something like this. She 
was in the hospital. And when
 the end was coming, it was 
the beginning of May, the Yugoslav were bom
bing with ca -- with ca-cannons, grenades, 
Fiume.
 And in order to be safer, 
they had -- they -- the engine
ers had the -- the shifts to 
spend the nights in the shipya
rd, to keep an eye on wh atev er was going on, you know? 
And I as a nurse, was staying with Father 
and we were sleeping underground in the 
shelter, under the rocks. It was a v ery safe 
she lter, I must say beca
use when they bombed, 
nothing happened to  us. They destroyed a lot 
of things, but the bomb  didn™t bother us. 
And, in parentheses, my fat -- my father 
was made th-the head of -- chief of the 
oompah
, 
which I don™t rememb er right now wh at it means, but it was a -- a -- a group which was 

taking care of -- in case of a fire -- so-some -- some kind of a firema n, in case of 
bombings and th ings of this 
kind. And he an d his work ers -- how -- how can I say? The 
Germans had put dynamite under all the cranes
 of the shipyard , because before leaving 
they wanted to destroy the shipya
rd s. Father and his men of the 
oompah, 
I don™t know 

 
Interview with TheaRips

when , I don™t know now because 
he didn™t -- they didn™t talk
 about these things, took off 
th -- everything, so that nothing blew 
up, you know, never s -- never tol -- never 
recognized because it wa
s an a -- again, a natural thing 
to do. So th -- he saved the 
shipyard. Never recognized, never got a pe
nny for it, but who wanted it anyhow? So 
anyhow, when they started to
 bomb th-th-the -- the bomb
s started to come from the 
Yugoslav side and the Yugoslavs were advanc
ing, the partisans and so on, the Germans 
started to flee. And it was a heavy bombardment.
 So we fa -- they said -- Father called the 
di-director, he said -- th-the -- of the -- of th
e shipyard, wh at do I do? He said, here I have 
a few men, and do I -- he said, do what you 
want. Washed  their hands. You -- you -- you 
decide, you do what you want, he said, beca
use I cannot leave here, nobody want -- you 
can leave because anyhow that 
is -- so -- so we -- we left and we went walking and it was 
quite the walk, you just -- like going from here
, more than down, going to -- from here to 

Bethesda, 
something like this. And we
 -- we heard the grenades, 
fssh, pssh
, falling 
around us. And I kept the white cas -- boar -- rope, you know, was a 
[indecipherable]
 on 
the street, y ou know. But do 
you think that the Germans bot
hered t-to bother us? They 
were running. They  were passing by us, goin
g, running, scup -- escaping, escaping. And -

- and then we went -- we we
nt home. And wh en we reach
ed home, since it was in a 
dangerous positions, we went to stay with a fa
mily, so me friends of ours for a --for a few 
days. Then we went back home and -- and 
it was May -- mu st have been the third or 
fourth , because 
Tito™s birthday, 
I think, is on the -- I have to look in  my  book, but was in

on th e fifth or the sixth of May, wh en they  started to shoot like crazy, 
pom, pom, pom, 
pom, pom
 to -- to celebrate, you know
? And ye -- we could see, since we are in this wide 
avenue, you know, living, it was just like goi
ng th rough a dead city, you know, all the 
shutters were down. We were looking throu
gh the shutters and they were coming with 
these carts, with the car 
-- with the -- how do you 
say, the animals, th e 
[indecipherable]
 
the warri -- 
[phone ringing]
 -- sorry. 
[tape break]
. So th-th-this was all the shutters 
down and they came wi -- on the carts, pulled 
by the oxen, and th at -- a thing which was 
unbelievable, and they  di -- a
nd you could see these people s
itting la -- you know, th-the 
poor -- I understand they -- they were po
or people who lived in the woods, these 
partisans, but they were rea
lly mean. And they were s-sta
nding on the streets and dancing 
the 
ko lo
. And th-the ones from 
Montenegro, 
th --
 
with the sh -- sheepco -- sheepskin 
coats over there ki-killing lice, you know. It wa
s terrible. And that 
was the time when we 
were afraid to talk, when we couldn™t even ta lk to friends because we didn™t know what 
we™re going to do, we -- what 
they were going to say or so
mething. These people di -- 
went in -- they enter some ap
artment, they didn™t understa
nd what they™re -- they didn™t 
know how to  use th-the -- the -- the -- the -- 
the -- the -- the facilities.
 They were looking 
at the chandeliers, you know, all this
 light coming from. It was really a 
[indecipherable]
 
affair. And that was it. So then 
they came, they wanted us to 
[indecipherable]
 as I said, 
and -- and then I, as I said, I went to -- first to 
F-Floren ce
 just for a visit.
 I came back to 
it -- to -- to
 Fiume
, then I went to 
Vald osta
 and when  I went to 
Padwa
 they told me not

[indecipherable]
 head-
headquarters 
Padwa
 garrison. I worked for there for aw
hile, taking care of the wives of 
the English soldiers, Italian wi -- and they
 picked up some very
 good kids, but they 
picked up a lot of trash t
oo, you know? And -- and after -- and I was there until ™48. 
When my father came out th -- 
my -- finally my father was fr
eed because the judge of this 
tribunal of the people w-was -- 
had been  friendly with th e Jews too, and he knew about 
our friendships or something, I don™t know ho
w. And I f -- with the excuse that Father 
had arthritis, one thing and the other, they said  no, no, no, he has to go -- he has to go to 
Abbano
, wh ich is a spa, and Father came out, but 
th-that man on the street didn™t want to 
talk. My f -- my father didn™t 
want to talk. He was turning 
always his head, he -- no, no, 
no, th-they are following me, they
 -- they™re -- that was -- Fath
er was ruined, that was it. 
And fr -- then in ™48 he didn™t want to stay in
 -- in -- he finally found a job down  south in 
-- near 
Foja,
 in 
Na po lia ,  
that he worked for aw
hile, and I worked too. I went to teach at 
the Boys Town in 
Bari
. And in Boys Town in our 
Ba ri
 came an American gentleman, 
Mr. 
Broya
 to visit this place. And at the s -- at
 the same time, I wa
s working with the

 of
 Ba ri
 for the rice company of 
Mila n
, and they told me that if I could 
be t-to help them, because Ambassador 
Dunne
 was coming to 
Bari

this way I started to get in touch with the Am
ericans, b ecause I went to -- I went to the 
theater, there were a ceremony, I was there with Ambassador 
Dunne
, I had the pictures 
around. And -- and th ere there were a certain Mr.

And we went from

And 
this way I got acquainted with 
the Americans and fine -- I got
 the permanent job with the

 in 
Italy --

 in ™40 - ™41, okay, this is all his work
, this has nothing to 
do with it. When he 
was a journalist, since we™re talking about jo
urn -- th-the pa -- newspapers, this is the 
right point, when  he was a journa
list, he covered the civil war in 
Spain
. And apparently 
he wrote something good th a-that he wrote for 
both sides. Of course, being a journalist he 
was covering th e whole thing, and apparently st -- 
Franco
 did something good too, an -
and he mentioned wh at he was -- done. So  that
 later on he was decorated with the Order

38
A: Yeah. It happened that 
when -- they left just while  the Germans were entering 
Belgium
. He -- he -- they had the car, and with
 this -- his parents, and -- and he -- 
[indecipherable]
 went through the 
Basque
 countries to 
Bayonne
 and th ey had to cross 
th-the border, and there is ther
 -- there was this bridge there 
in th-the border. He -- he was 
able to go there very easily because he wa
s known , he had been de
co rated and so on. And 
he went to  see 
Carrero, 
Ad miral 
Carrero Blanco,
 who at the time was only a -- a naval 
officer or something, only of -- of -- I don™t k
now how he was related in th -- th-the rel -- 
the relationship with 
Franco
 and -- an-and 
Carrero Blanco
, I don™t know what it was. 
Q: Ha-Had -- had he already -- 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: -- had he already been decorated by 
Franco
 by this time? 
A: Let™s see. This I don™t know. I have to lo
ok becau -- ah, wait, I have th-th-th-the -- I 
have the certificate. 
[tape break] 

Q: So according to your document, he wa
s awarded this ho-honor in November 4
th
, 
1940? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay .  
A: And he -- I don™t know if -- if 
Carrero Blanco
, I think was the one who c -- put in 
contact with 
Franco
, you see, they want to talk to 
Franco
. He said, no, but it™s 

 
Interview with TheaRips

39
impossible, and so on, so forth.
 No, no, no, he said, it™s importa
nt, I want to talk to him, 
and 
Franco
 received him. 
Q: 
Franco
 received your husband? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Franco
 received my husband. A
nd my  husband talked to 
Franco
, 
and he said listen, we are escaping from
 Belgium
. There is plenty of people at the border 
who cannot come over because they  have -- don™
t have documents, th
ey -- they -- they -- 
there are so many, they don™t know -- but there were not only Jews, there were 
communists, there were all people who wa
nted to escape fro
m -- from -- from the 
Germans, you know? 
Q: And get into 
Spa in
. 
A: And late -- get into 
Spain
. And he said, why don™t you 
make a good gesture and ope-
open the border, let these people co me in? Be
cause otherw ise th-they -- they are lost, you 
know, they™re -- and apparently 
this is -- I tell you wh at -- what
 he told me. So apparently 
Franco
 said, wh-why should I do it? He said , wh
y? And my  husband said, because this 
is, I think, the right thing to  do. And so  
Franco
 called somebody in, sign a paper and they  
open the border and these people 
were able to come over. And 
he told me that they were 
not put in concen tration camps or nothing. 
Q: Did your husband sa
y about how many people he
 was talking about? 
A: No. No, he didn™t, he didn™t.
 He said there were many, sa
id they were running, they 
had nothing, they said th-they even  prin ted 
a stamp that th-th-the police at the border 

 
Interview with TheaRips

40
stamped a -- cards, you know, iden
tity cards. Whatever paper they
 had, just to let them in 
and then  they would let them go. They  didn™t 
ask what they were, wh
at they -- what they 
were doing, where they were coming, they wo
uld let them in like this. That™s what my 
husband says. 
Q: And he was with his family? 

A: He was with his family and th
en he was for a short while in 
Spa in
 and then they 
moved to  
Portugal 
and from 
Portugal 
they came to the 
United States
. 
Q: Okay . And now let™s -- a
nd then he worked in the 
United States
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And then  later on you met him? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But I met -- I met h im mu
-much later, mu ch later.  
Q: And di -- ha -- did all his family survive the war? 
A: Well, he -- some of his relatives, I don™t kn
ow if some uncles, aunts, so on, to  whom 
he always said leave, leave, leave, they -- of 
course they  didn™t want to leave, never heard 
of them. But his brother was already in 
Australia
 and his sister too. So his brother died a 
natural death in 
Australia
 and his sister,  after  she -- she was marrie d  in 
Australia
 with a 
-- I think a German Jew. And -- but married in 
Germany
 and went to 
Australia
. And she 
had a son, sh -- her husband died , and then  
her 16 year old son died
, so she came to the

. 
Serge
 helped her to come here, and sh

living in 
New Yo rk
, and never remarried. 
Q: So he came to the 
United States
 with his parents? 
A: With his pare --

 This is tape number two, side

starting to talk about his decorations. 
A: Well, the decorations he received was -- is
 Officer of the National Order of the Legion 
of Ho nor of 
France. 
Commander of the Mo st Exalted Or
der of the White Elephant of 
Thailand
, and Knight Commander of the Most Ex
alted Order of the White Elephant 
Thailand
 -- this is a knightgood -- knightgo --
 knighthood, with th
e motivation -- in 
gratitude for fruitful and unstinted a
ssist ance. Because thanks to him, 
Japan
 returned the 
-- the gold and whatever, owed 
them for war reparations. The 
Legion of Honor was given

to him because returning th
 -- whatever was taken by 
Japan
 from 
Indochina
, they took 
also s -- whatever wa
s French or -- in 
Indochina, 
and so they had 
to return it to 
France
, 
and 
France
 decorated him with the order, the 
Officié
 of the -- the Legi
on of Honor. Then 
he received from 
Japan
, even though
 Japan
 was defeated in a way, by him, the wa -- the 
wa -- the Order the k -- Knight Co mmander of the Order of the Sacred Treasure of 
Japa n
, wh ich is knighth ood, wh ich was given by Minister 
Shiga Mitsu
, who said this is 
the first time 
Japan
 decorates with deep thanks, enem
y on battlefield, w
ithout alienating 
us, you know? Then he had other 
orders. Order of the Jade of 
China
, and the Order of the 
Golden Ear, also of 
China, 
which he received when he was still a jo urnalist in 
Belgium
 
because he started the campaign to erase th
e unequal treaties which were made between 
the European countries and 
China  
wh ereby -- m- many countries of 
Europe
 had their 
concessions in 
China
 and the Chin ese got no -- got nothi
ng fo r them, and he started, with 
his new-newspapers in gi -- in 
Belgium
 to write why, what do we need them? Why do 
you we do th is? What a -- so 
Belgium
 took off -- closed their da -- their thing. And little 
by little the other countries were -- le-le-left 
China
 in peace and th -- and they got the -- 
the 
[indecipherable]
 back, you see? That™s why he 
got these two orders from the 
Chinese. Then he got th
e Order of the Crown fr-fr-from
 Romania -- Romania, 
but here I 
don™t know why. He got the Order of the Crown of
 Italy 
because he was the only Belgian 
journalist who was invited to 
attend th e wedding of Prince
 Humberto
, th-the son of th e 
king of 
Italy [indecipherable]
 third to the pr -- the Belgian Princess
 Maya José.

was there to report on the wed 
-- and so th ey gave him the or
der, you see? Why did he get 
the order as the -- o-of 
Izhat --
 Knight of th e Order of 
Izhat
 of 
Afghanistan
? I don™t 
know. I have no idea. He to
ld me probably, this I know
 he told me, but I forgot. 
Q: So when did you get married? 
A: We were -- officially in 19 f -- Fe-Feb
ru ary, Friday  February 13, 19 sic -- ™76.  
Q: Ninetee -- and -- and what kind -- 

A: But we were -- but we -- we went togeth
er since -- well, 18 years of engagement and 
18 years of marriage. We didn™t get married  un
til practically I left my job, because I had 
the -- this job with atom
ic energy commission of 
Italy
 and he said well yo-you know, 
better not, and better not, then finally when  I 
-- then -- then we decided that was about 
time. You know, we f -- we talked it over quite a bit. 

Q: And -- and you lived  in 
New Yo rk
, and then wh en did you come to 
Washington
? 
A: I never live in 
New York, 
I always lived in 
Wash ington, 
always. I -- b-because I 
came here, I was staying w
ith a -- first in a fr -- 
[indecipherable] 
wh en  I was an  
interpreter, then I moved in 
with a girl who was working 
with Italian ta -- technical 
delegation. Then , wh en I 
left and went back  to 
Italy, 
when I came back here I got a -- an 
apartment at the 
Alban 
Towers
 
a -- on 
Columbia
 Road. Then 
they built the 
Co lonna d e.
 
In the meantime my husband wa
s living in different places, and it -- he was not mine -- 
my  husband, of course, at the time
. And then we moved both into  the 
Colonnade
 when it 
was built. I had an apartment on the se
venth floor, he had apartment on the 12
th
 floor. 

 
Interview with TheaRips

46
Then from there we -- we moved to 
Bethesda
 fo -- just for a year, because he was scared, 
he didn™t want to buy th e apartment. And wh
en it became a condominium, then we rented 
here at the Towers for a year or somethi
ng. Then from here when this one became a 
condominium, we moved to a 41 
[indecipherable]
 and then finally decided it was about 
time to buy an apartment and we moved he
re in ™81 and I been here since.  
Q: Just to finish off, do you 
-- are you an American citizen? 
A: Yes, yes, I am an American citizen. 
Q: Wh-When did you become a citizen? 
A: ™98. 

Q: Mm-hm, 1998. Do you -- wh -what are yo
ur thoughts now, 
looking back? You had 
such an in teresting childhood and you did 
-- do you -- do you have any final thoughts 
about what happened du
ring the war and your relationship 
with the Jewish families that 
you helped, from this vantag
e point of 50 years later? 
A: Well, from -- n-now that I™m old and wise, I 
hope wise, yes, I -- I see wher -- o-on a 
diff -- I -- I -- I -- I didn™t realize, first of all,
 that my life was interesting. It was living, 
you know? Only  now, going back and remember
ing these things, yes, I -- I think that it 
was -- life was while living and probably if 
I would live again I would do it again the 
same things as 
[indecipherable]
. And as far as the Jewish s
ituation is concerned, well, 
my  feelings had always been the same. T-To 
me that we are all human beings and with -- 
as I told you, I found out th at the people were Jewish by
 chance, and not because we -- 

 
Interview with TheaRips

47
and only after the war they started what are 
you. Are you this, are you th at? Never dream 
-- never -- never, never dreamt, we™re just good 
friends, period. You know, no prejudice. 
Ma -- there was never any prejudice in my fa
mily -- I remember ev en my grandfather -- 
now I reme mb er that they had probably  some
 Jewish friends, from th
e names that they -- 
vaguely I remember, b u t one more -- one th
ing really I™m very 
happy of, that in 
Trieste
 
we have the mo st beautiful synagogue, 
beau tiful, and I don™t know how it was not 
touched. It is -- well, p r-proba
bly they stole something away, 
they -- they -- 
they -- they -- 
they -- they used it, the Germ
ans, for something, but it -- it 
was not torn, it™s a beautiful 
synagogue. I don™t know how it happen. And -- and in -- in 
Trieste, 
for instance, where I 
was born, in my mentality is more
 Triestini 
than 
Italiana
. I am very much middle 
European not -- I don™t -- I feel Italian very
 deeply one way, but 
more middle European. 
And I™m proud of it because if -- 
you have to re
ad that book by 
John  Mo rris
, youknow, 
Trieste
 
[in d ecipherable]
 and you will see. An
d we had, for instance, our great -- two -- 
two of the greatest 
Triestini
 writers,
 Humberto Saba
, he is half Jewish, mother Jewish 
and -- and father not. And 
Italos Levo
, who was 
[indecipherable]
 is also -- makes -- and 
we had a -- a fantastic Jewish community over there in 
It aly
. But we didn™t think of it. 
They were -- we are 
Triestini
. 
Q: Was the synagogue in 
Fium e
 ever restored? 
A: No, th -- I don™t know what
 they built there, they told
 me. We -- I went back to 
Fium e
 
25 years after the end of the war. We didn™t ha
ve the heart to go. This is really another

experience really worthwhile te-t
ell -- recounting, 
to show what 
Yugoslavia
 was under
 
Tito
. And we went with my  nephew who at the 
time was about 10 year 
old. And we went 
to all the places where we had lived. Ha
 -- he -- and we went to slees -- via
 Mario Asso 
number two, where my sa -- my family, the 
Moscovitz
, the 
Weiss
 and the 
Schtitzel
 were 
living. 
[crying]
. We find so  much. How uncivilized th
ey are -- or they were over there. 
We had th at -- you know, we were -- a few st
ep underneath, there was the apartment over 
there -- of the porter -- of the doorman, they say. And after the stairs there -- th -- there 
were the boxes for their mail. Mailboxes w
ith the names, you know? The names were 
there. To us it was a terrible thi
ng. Not our, that was not, but the 
Schtitzel 
were there. 
And the 
Mo scov itz
 w ere there, but the 
Mo scovitz
 at least died peacefully, but when we 
saw the 
Schtitze l
 there, it was so mething so terri
ble, so terrible. I™m sorry.  
Q: Oh no, no. Oh.  
A: That was a terrible experience.  

Q: Is there any message you want to give
 to people who might listen to this tape? 
A: Well, you know, it™s -- it™s a message whic
h should  -- wh-which has been repeated 

and repeated and repeated thousand times. It
 should never any mo re, never, nevermore. 
Unfortunately we can see it ha
ppening over and over again. But with  how mu ch  we 
reach, with how much we pray, 
[indecipherable]
 what we do -- well, maybe we are too 
few doing, thinking like this, I don™t know.

Q: Have you remained an ob
servant Catholic since child
 -- have you remained an 
observant Catholic since childhood? 
A: Yes, well, you know, at the beginning it was a li -- 
Serge
 was little 
[indecipherable]
 
in certain way, he would have liked me to co
nvert. And I was -- I would listen. I -- I love 
you the way you are. You love me the way y
ou are, why -- I -- I wer -- it were -- I grew 
up this way. And I even went to a rabbi for 
a summer to be -- for ed
ucation to -- to -- to 
learn, but I -- I didn™t feel it. And not because 
I have ha -- because I -- I know that we are 
fundamentally we are Jews, nothing doing, you
 know. No, we are Jews. Noth ing doing in 
tha -- we™re -- we -- well, we just accept one th
ing that you didn™t accept, period, but we 
are the same, absolutely. So I 
was not able to do it, I -- I could not. Not that my  parents 
objected, not at all. M y  father said, do what
 you want, you -- you do f -- what you feel 
like doing. But I didn™t feel like doing it. 
Then, for -- but I was always going -- my 
husband was not very observant. We were mo re
 observant when we we
re more with the -
- with the 
Korns,
 you know, and we were going to th ei
r house, then we were going to the 
synagogue. There was a time of -- o-of 
Rabinovitz, 
we loved his sermons, we became 
very good friends, so it -- it was a -- and I went
 to all the festivities,
 I enjoyed them very 
much, I followed and so on. And so metimes 
Serge
 came to -- but I didn™t go to church . I 
didn™t go. Well, you know, the -- 
Serge 
di-didn™t like it, so I didn
™t go. Then -- then for a 
couple of su -- we were -- w-we spent a couple of Christmases 
[indecipherable]
 
Catholic, just let™s go to meet -- w ent to meet 
[indecipherable]
 so we are going to meet

[indecipherable]
 an-and a -- and 
Serge
 was coming. Then, t-towards the end, th-the feel 
-- the last few years at Easter
, Serge
 was saying, hey, we -- y-yo
u -- this is Easter. We -- 
you have to go to chur -- we were -- he was 
going to church with 
me, you see? So that 
was a -- the kind of a di -- di -- mix up. 
And if you look at my -- it was -- we were
 
laughing yesterday with some people, becaus
e I have a-an in -- an image of the Virgin
 
and on top of the bed I have 
Dav i d
 with the head of 
Goliath.
 And even in 
Rome, 
I -- I 
have in the -- on -- on my night table, a -- a -- a -- a menorah. So, you know, it™s -- but 
that™s the way I feel. 
Q: When  did your husband pass away? 

A: He passed away on September nine. Sept
ember 9, 1994. It™s impossible for me to 
think that it™s almo st 10 years. Nine years past.  
Q: And now you are 
moving back  to 
Italy
, you said? 
A: Yes, now I move. I -- I tell you, it™s very pa
infu l, because all of my friends are like the 
Korns, 
and then others, they are all here, you 
know? I spent 38 years of my  life here. I 
never spent more than -- than eight y
ears in an apartmen
t in -- in -- in 
Europe
. Here I am 
22 -- 22 years. And in 
Euro pe
 I have a lot of friends, but they are all over 
Italy
, you 
know, is not -- here I have a concen tration of  friends in my  life, and besides here I had 
the very good life, met very in
teresting people. I-It 
was -- my sister, sh
e had a completely 
different life. I was the lucky one 
in the -- in the 
family. So --
