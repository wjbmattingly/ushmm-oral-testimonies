W ebegin with this portrait of  Josiane Aizenberg walking on a street in 
B ru sse ls.   Jo si
e was born March 21,1939 in Brussels, Belgium , to Jacques and 
Fanny Aizenberg.  The arrow points to Brussels.  
 
 
T he Germ an arm y conquered Belgium  in May of  1940.  Shortly before the 
occupation, Josie'sfather lef tBelgium to jointhe British Arm y.  In this photo, we 

see Josie with her parents in Brussels.  
 
 
In 1942, Josie'sm other Fanny was able to secure ahiding placef orJosie 
in a convent inBruges, Belgium . Here we see Josieand Fanny shortly before 
Josie went into hiding.  Soon thereafter, Fanny, who worked with the Belgian 
underground,or the resistance, was denounced and she was deported to 
A u sch wit z.   
 
 
Af ter six m onthsof  hiding in a convent and growing Na zi suspicion, the 
Belgian underground relocated Josie to hidewith the Debrackelaers, a Ch
ris t ia n 
fam ily in Brussels. Here we see Josie with the Debrackelaers.  Josie is in the 
f ront,on your right, right here. Behind her are the Debrackelaers.T he coupleto

Af term oving to the United States with her parents in 1949, and then 
com pleting her schooling in Paterson, New

T eachers' Collegefor one year.  Josieand Freddie were m arriedona ship a year 
af ter shem et him, and she m oved to Israel where they lived f orf iveyears. While 
in  I s
rael, theT raum s' son Michael and daughter Yael were born.  
 
 
Upon theadvice of m edical experts in Israel, theT raum s relocated to the 
United States in1963 to obtainm edical carefor their disabled son,Michael.  
T heir third child, Jonathan, who is also disabled, was born in the United States.  
Eventually, Freddie's work brought them  toVienna, Virginia.  Josie returned to

Your parents, Fanny and Jacques Aizenberg, were m arried inearly 
1938, and you were born thefollowing March 1939.  Justm onthsbefore 
Germ any and Russia attacked Poland, launchingW orldW ar II. T ellus about 
your parentsand their life in Brussels prior towar beginning. W hatwas their lif e 
lik e ?   
 
>> Josie T raum :  OK. First of all, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm so glad there'sa 

full audience. T hank youfor com ing in.  
 
 
My parents leda pretty, I guess,newlyweds' li fe. Both m y parents were in 
the textile and dressmaking and sewing industry.  M y m otherhad graduatedf rom 
technical design art school,and she becam ea dressm akerand apattern 
designer, and sheactually worked for the royalf am ily, which was a real big deal 
a t tha t tim e .  
 
 
My dad was a tailor.  However, bef ore he becam e a tailor, he used to be a 
violinist.  Many, m any years ago, I'm  sure way, way bef oreany of  your times, 
thereused tobem ovies that were silent. Becausethey were silentm ovies, they 
usedtohave a quartet, anorchestra playing m usic while thef ilm  was being 
shown.  Once the talkies cam e,once thef ilms becam e talking, like they are 
today, m y dad lost his job. They didn't needm usicians anym ore inall of  the 
m ovie houses. Sohewent to school,andactually learned to be a tailor.  
 
  
So bothm y parents were involved in clothesm aking, andthey were 

7 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
m arried,and asnewlyweds I was born about a year and ahalf  later.  SoI think 
they were a young couple with just me com ing around.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Josie,do you know whetheror not 
--
 
f rom  what they said to you 
later, thatthey were married in 1938, later that year in Novem ber, of  course, 
things became evenmore om inous in Nazi Germ any with Kristallnacht, and you 
cam e along in March 1939.  T here were war c louds,Septem berthewar would 
begin.  Do youthink your parents weref earful about thefuture at that time, when 
you were born?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ithink they really were.  At the tim e,there were rum ors in 

Belgium  that whentheGerm ans would invade, it was said, they woul d leave the 
wom en and childrenalone, and only arrest the men. So theref ore, there are 
alwa ys calls on the radio asking peopleto volunteerf or thearm y.  
 
 
My dad and his brother heard the callsfrom  the British to com eonover, 
cross the channelandjoin the British Arm y.  Som y dadand his brother, who 
were both tailors, actually took one of the last ships across the channel in 1940, 
and came to England to volunteerfor
 
the British Arm y.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to take you backfor just am omentbeforewe continue 

f rom  there, Josie.  As a resultof  Kristallnacht, the Night of  Broken Glass, in 
Novem ber 1938, didn't your parents take infor shelter a Jewish child,for
 
a 
period?

R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
>> Josie T raum : T hey did.  Jews were running awa y f rom many of  the eastern 
European countries,f rom Poland, Czechoslovakia, tryin g tof inda saf er place to 
be.  So m y m om  
--
 
actually, bothm y parents and grandparents took in people 
who would stay with them  for afew days till they wouldf inda safer place, 

perhaps crossing aborder in another country.  Sothere was alwa ys a lotof 
m ovement in ourapartm ent.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we com eback to thewar itself , I just have to ask you to 

e xp
lain how you got your nam e, Josiane.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  My r eal name is Josiane.  It's nam edf or a Frenchsinger.  My 

m other adored thatnam e.  She thought it was m arvelous. Here I was given that 
ver y special nam e.W hen I cam eto this country as a little
 
girl, nobody could say 
Josiane.  And so Ibecam e a Josie. SohereI am , I come to you asJosie.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Germ ans, of course, attacked Belgium  and France in May 
1940.  As you explained, with war looking like  it was going to come to Belgium, 
your f ather responded to the callf rom the British to goto Englandtof ightfor 
them . As you say, hem ade itaway f rom  Dunkirk.  Can you tell usm oreabout 
Dunkirk?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  No,Ican't. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here were, I think, several ships

>> Josie T raum :  I seewhat you're saying.  I'm  sorry.  Only a couple ships made 
it.  Many were torpedoed by the Germ ans.  My dad, being on the ship,m ade it 
across the channel, got toEngland.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did your m other know that?  
 
>> J o s i e  T r au
m :  Shedid not.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he last she saw, he was going off  to England
 
--
 
>> Josie T raum :  Not knowing what would happen to him.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith him  gone, it's you and your mom. W hat happenedthen? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  My m om  and I were living to gether, with m y m aternal 
grandparents,m y m other's parents,and we lived ver y m uch together in an 
apartm ent,hiding.  Pretty m uch in hiding. W hen the Germans came, you had to 
have an identity card identif ying if  you were a Jew.  If you were a Jew, when you 
were walking on the street, a Germ an would stop youand say, " Show m e your 
identif ication card."  Of course, if they saw you were Jewish, they m ight arrest 
you, deport you, or you really didn't know what was going to happen.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatabout your grandparents?  Both setsof  grandparents, I 
believe, were still alive at that tim e?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  My f ather's parents, m y grandf ather actually diedbef ore I was 

born.  My grandmother f rom m yf ather's sidediedoncethe war began,and it
 
wa s  
not war

related. Bothm y paternal grandparents died.  My m aternal 
grandparents, we lived with them , pretty m uch in hiding together wit h them.

>> Bill Benson:  Yourm aternal grandm otherworked at aplacefor the homeless 
a t tha t tim e?   
 
>> J o s i e  T r a
um :  It was a society that took care of  people tom ake sure they had 
food.  It was like a Jewish kindof  comm unity,society.  She would 
--
 
because of 
that, she would som etim es geta littlebit off oodfor us.At thattim e,in Belgium , 

food was rationed.  You only got certain rations once a week.  Youwould pick up 
thefood, andthat's really all you would have.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atone point, your grandf ather was arrested, wasn'the?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  My grandf ather was arrested, andhe was taken to one o
f  these 
gathering camps called Malin, or Mecaline. T he Jews
 
--
 
actually, the prisoners 
would be gathereduntil they had enough of them , then they would deport them 

by railroad cars totheconcentration cam ps.Som y grandfather was actually 
taken before m y
 
grandm other and m other.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now it's thethree of  you, your m other and grandmother.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How did they makeends meet?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  My grandmother worked, not only f or the Jewish comm unity, 

but she
 
also worked what we call hada kaddisha. W hena Jewish person dies, 
you are taken care of; they make sure youhave a properburial,and they watch 

over you.  Som y grandm other was very in vol ved, where the Jewish comm unity, 

11 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
people who were dying, she would
 
get f ood f rom  them .  Really, we did with 
whatever little we could get.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  If I rem em ber right, you wer e telling me thatall healthcare was 
cu t off?   
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 

>>
 
Bill Benson:  Here you are, a young child, the clinics andeverythi ng were 
closed to you justbecause you were Jewish.  
 

>> Josie T raum :  Exactly.  All of those things were controlled by theGermans, 
andthey were of  course closed, so I was notable to go
.  
 
 
W hen you're a newborn, you go to a special clinic
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Likeawell baby clinic?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  A well baby clinic, afew tim es am onth, tomake sure you're 
gaining the right weight, getting the shots you need. All of  that was closed. I was 
pretty m uch on m y own with m y m om  and grandm other. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you were saying a f ew mom entsago, Josie, you had 

identif ication cards,and you never knew what would happen.  Youdescribe to 
m eone of  yourearly m em ories, because youwere so young, but you do have an 
early m emory of an incidentona bus.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ido. I remember sitting ona bus, it was beforemy third 

birthday.  I was really still a little one. My m other and I were riding the bus, public 
transportation, and
 
a Germ an off icer, Nazi, cam eon thebus, and what they 

12 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
would do, they would go from  row to row andaskf or your identif ication card.  You 
hadto show it to them , of course.  
 
 
I remember sitting next to m y m om , who was ver y, very scared, andI 
didn't unde
rstand why,  and I was only 3 years old,noteven 3.  Anyhow, the 
Germ an cam ef rom  row to row, asking f or the ID cards.  All thepassengers on 
the tram actually would give him  the card, and he would read itand give it back.  
 
 
He got tothe last row where m y m om and Iwere sitting, andfor som e 
reasonheturned around and left thetram, so henever came, he never actually 
askedm y m om for identity cards, which is obviousl y pretty lucky.  I think 
som ebody m usthavebeen looking over.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  A str
oke  of  lu ck.   
 
>> Josie T raum :  Justa strokeof  luck.  My mother was shaking.  I really didn't 
understand why.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other gotactive in the resistance, theunderground, which 
hadtobe just an extraordinarily brave thing to do.  
 
>> J o
s ie  T rau m :  Righ t .   
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what you know about that. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  OK. At that tim e, of  course, I didn't understand what was going 

on.  
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t , righ t .   
 

13

>> Josie T raum :  My m other was hiding people in our apartment. W e always had 
people therehiding till they founda betterplace to go.  She would also deliver 
newsletters, leaf lets for m eetingsf or where the underground, or resistance 
against the Germ answould bem eeting.  Soshe was busy with all of these 
th in gs, 
andm y understanding is she was ver y involved with that. Becauseof  
that, she wantedtom ake sure that I would be saf e.  She actually got in touch 

with the underground and m ade sure that somebody would pick m eup and place 
m e in hiding.  
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
T hatwas one of the real m otivators
 
--
 
a real motivator was in 
1942 the Nazis beganearnest efforts deporting the Jews.  
 
>>
 
Josie T raum :  Right.  In1942 thedeportations began. They started gathering 
Jews, deporting themm ainly to Auschwitz.  My m other wanted tom ake sureI 

would be safe, so oneday, 1942 I was 3 years old,and two strangeladies came 
to pick m e up.  T hey ac
tually pickedm eup.My m other, by the way, was not 
allowed to know where they were taking m e,because they knew wh en the 

Germ ans would com eto deport you, toarrest you, they would beat you till you 
would tell them  where the restof thefam ily was.  
 
 
So
 
m y m other, these two strange ladies came topick me up,and my 
m other was not allowed to know where they were taking m e. They tookm etoa 
convent inBruges, abeautiful little city nearBelgium ,near canals. It's really 
beautif ul, lots of convents.  
 

14 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
 
I was takentoa convent, very m uch likean orphanage.  In thosedays, 
when people couldn't take care of their kidsor didn'thave enoughfood and the 
war was going on, people would put their kids in a convent, which was like an 
orphanage. W hen the parent
s could, were able tom anage andtakecare of  
them , they would pickup the children. 
 
 
So this convent wasf ull of  kids,and unbeknownst to m e there were three 
other Jewish children there being hidden.  So there werefour Jewish kids hidden 

in this conven
t.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Along with many othernon
-
Jewish kids?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Josie,has your mother had the opportunity to tell you what it was 
like for hertoactually put you intohiding toan unknown place, not knowing when 
an
d if she would see you again? T hat was ahuge decisionfor her to make. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  It was a huge decision.  Itm usthave been sodifficult.  I think to 

m yself now, m y grandchildren, I don't think I'dbe able to just give them up and 
not know where
 
they were going.  
 
 
Obviously, m y m otherm ade the sacrif ice in deciding to takea chance and 
have m e be safe, andeven though she didn't know where I was goi ng.  Indeed, 
she really didn't know.  One im portant thing to rem em ber in Belgium , in most of 
Europ
e, if  you were hiding a Jew and the Germ ans wouldf ind you they would just 
shoot you.  No questions asked. They would just shoot you. 
 

15 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
 
So the nuns whohidme were really riskin g their lives.  T hey were really 
taking a chance.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know anything about how your m other was able to m ake 
thearrangementsfor you to go, or just her connections inthe underground?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Justher connections in theunderground. Indeed,they sent two 

ladies to pickm eup.  Ileft.  I didn't seem y m otheragain till the endof  the war.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. Right.  You were in the convent, I thinkfor about six 
m onths.W hatdo you rem em ber?  Again, knowing ho w little you we re.  Do you 
recall anything of  your lif ethere?  
 
>> Josie T raum : T henuns were very strict.  But m y understanding, it's not 

because
 
--
 
they were very strict with m e. They were strict with all of the kids, not 
just because I was Jewish.  I have spoken to m any people who have goneto 

Catholic school with nuns, they said, "
oh, yeah."   
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: T heyget it.  
 
>> Josie T raum : T hey get it. T hey were reall y, reall y strict.  Butthey saved m y 

lif e. W hat can I say?  One thing I do rem em ber about thenuns, thisshocked me 
m orethan anything else, we slept in big dorms, and the nuns in those days wore 
ver y stiff  habits like you see in "TheSoundof Music,"  very stiff , very tight around 
here. Thenuns at night would take off theirheadgear to goto sleep. T hey would 
sleep with us inthe room s.  
 

16 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
 
I  wa s sh o cke d
, they were bald. That gave me the biggest shock.  Ithink 
it's because it was so hot with the headgear,what they wore, they m usthave 
shaved their heads. I know that's what shockedm em ore thananything else.  I 
had never seen a bald wom an.  
 
[Laughter
] 
I did that, it was pretty scary.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  You were saying they were s trict, but not just in thesenseof  
don'tdothis,don't do that. You toldm eabout, not an incident, you were a finicky 
eater,I believe you said.  How did they handle 
f in ic k y
-
eating kids?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  I remem ber throwing up,and they would let m e stay in bed in 

m y throw
-
up, which is pretty horrible. They wouldalso putm e in a closet to 
punish me and say the devil would com eandget m e.  But here again, it's not 

because I was a Jew.  T his ishow they were with all of the kids. I happened to 
have been a very f inicky eater.  My m other used to play into it.  I survi ved, 
though.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had to, of course, have a differentnam e while you were 

there.  T e

>> Josie T raum :  Belgi um  has two languages, two different ethnic groups.  T hey 

speak Flem ishand French.  SoI was gi ven aFlem ishnam e. My f irst nam e was 
the same, Josiane, but instead of Aizenberg,a very Je wish Germ anname, they

gave m e the name ofVan
 
Berg, a very Dutch nam e, very Flem ish name. Som y 
name did change. They gave me adiff erentnam e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You explained tome one time that, you toldm e what you 
thought was them ostsignif icant im pacton you personally while yo u were in the 
convent.  Do you remem ber talking about it? It was 
--
 
the impact was just the 
lack of nurturing. W ill you say a little bit about that?  
 
>> Josie T raum : T his is where m y tears come.  I strongly, strongly belie
ve , with  
all of  the social work I've doneand with thepsychology and childdevelopment, 
and whatI've really re ad, I really learnedthat thef irst three years ina child's 
development are themost important,asfar as bonding with the caretaker, not 
neces
sarily a parent,but a person who takescare of the child,a caretaker that 
you learn to trustand you bond with.  
 
 
I must say thatm y f irst three years were with m y m other, andI bonded 
with her, and I really felt nurtured and loved. So Ifeel whatever 
happened 

af terwards, being inthe convent, having a pretty diff icult tim e,I really f eel that I 
kind of basically relied on thosef irst three years of  bonding andnurturing with m y 
m other,and I think they m adem e strong asa person, asa child.  
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  I know that's hard totalk about, so thank youfor that.  Josie, 

af ter about six m onths in the convent, the nuns m ade thedecision to m ove you 
outof  there.W ill you tell us what you know about that?

>> Josie T raum :  My understanding is thatthe nunsfound out thatthe Germ ans 
were going to com eand pick up thefour Jewish children, the other three andme.  
So by night, thenuns sm uggled me out of theconvent andtookme back to 
Brussels, which is where I was originall y f rom. T here, they placed
 
me , the y m u st 
have had connectionswith the underground, they placedme with aChristian 

fam ily in Brussels. You saw thepictureof  the Debrackelaers. I was with them  
the rem ainderof  the war.  It was am other, afather,and a little girl.  And I pretty
 
m uch stayed with them for the entire durationof  the war.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Almost two full years?  
 
>> Josie T raum : T wo full years.  And thef ather, Mr.
 
Debrackelaer, was involved 
with the resistance, in the undergroundm ovem ent. Very often, hewould 
be 
taken out during theday and questionedand interrogated, but he never told them  
thatI was there.  
 
 
He used to actually work in theundergroundagainst the Germ ans,as a 
Christian, which m any Christians did.  So I was ver y, ver y luck y they kept me.  
T
hey keptm e saf e, and they risked their lives.  Because, here again, had the 
Germ ans known thatthey were hiding m e, they would have been shot.  
 
 
Also, asIm entioned bef ore,food was rationed in Belgium , andbecause 
they were a fam ily of  three,m other,father and child,they would pick upfoodf or 

a week in rations, and I was not listed there,because I was there illegally.  So 
they actually got f oodfor three peopleand shared it with me.

Mr.
 
Debrackelaer, whenever he was interrogated,never toldthem
 
tha t I 
was there, andactually I remained safe therefor the entire durationof the war.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatcan you tell us, what do you remember,again knowing 
how young you were, what life was like living with them?  Ipresum e to neighbors 
you m ust

>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 

>> Bill Benson: W hat life was like for you during thattim e.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  I kept ver y m uch tom y

well, not I, thefam ily keptver y m uch 
to them selves. W e stayed indoors. I playedwith the little girl.  And our life was 
ver y m uch lim ited.T he f am ily took a risk. They saved m y lif e, which I'mf orever 
grateful f or.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time do you rem em ber what kind of setting?  Did 
they live in the city, outside?  
 
>> J o s i e

were in a m ainf loor, as you come in, it was them ainf loor. And there was a 
bedroom where we

actually, the parents slept in one bedroom and the little girl 
and I slept in another bedroom .
 
W eplayed, and we were very much to 
ourselves.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And do you know if neighbors knew you were there?

>> Josie T raum :  I was very much inside. I wouldbe able to getoutonce in a 
while to m y grandparents.  You saw the picture, of the Debrackelaers with my 
grandparents' neighbors.  So sometimes I would meet with them , and I would be 
with them ,but asidef rom that, we really kept to ourselves.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he war endedfor Belgium ,notelsewhere in Europe butf or 

Belgium , inthef all, I believe, of  1944.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  You were liberated with theDebrackelaers and other
s.  One  of 
your auntsfound you.T ell us what you know about that, and then what 

happened f rom  there.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  My m om  had two sisters, m y two aunts, and they were also, by 
the way, during the war hidden through the underground. T hey wer e all hidden in 
churches. T hey actually rem ained in churches for the entire duration ofthe war.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Actually in the church?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  In the church. T hey stayed there.  One aunt had three boys 

andher husband, andthey all stayed in the church,and all survived , all remained 
a live .   
 
 
W hat Iforgot to mention before,by the way, m y m other, very soonaf ter I 
was taken away to theconvent,m y m other was deported to Auschwitz.  She and 

her mother were deported. My grandf atherhad already been deported to 
Auschwitz.  So m y grandparentsdidnot survi ve.  Howe ver, m y m other did. And 

21 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
what I do wanttom ention, my two aunts really were saved through the 
underground, throughchurches.  Because there was a whole network in the 
underground, m y aunt
 
knew where tof indm e.  T here was like a network you 
couldf ind people whowere also hidden. 
 
 
Som y auntfoundm e,and very soon after that when shef oundme she 
broughtm etoher house.  AndI stayed there till m y m other eventually cam e 

b a ck.   
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson: W hich would be later, in1945.  You were with your AuntTheresa 
quite a while.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember any of  that tim e?  
 
>>
 
Josie T raum : T hey treatedm e like theirpet. She had three sons. T hey were 
all older than me. She treatedm e like a littlem ascot.  
 
[Laughter]
 
T hey spoiledm e rotten.  They were wonderful tom e. T hey were really terrific.  
My m other hadbeen deported to Auschwitz, and she survi ved.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we turn to that, if  that's OK, tell us a little bitabout your 

aunt'shusband, your uncle.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. His name was Maurice.  He was a very quiet, shy, m eek 

m an.  Andaf ter the war, we foundout he got special honorsfor killing Germ ans.  
He apparently was part of  theunderground, and none of us couldbelieve it.  I 

22 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
was a little girl, I didn't understand very m uch, butm y m om and hertwo sisters 
could not believe that Maurice was able 
to do this. 
 
 
He actually went in the undergroundand attacked Germ ans andhelped 
Jews as m uch ashe could,and he got a special award, which was am azing to 
m e .  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatabout your other aunt?  
 

>> Josie T raum :  My other aunt was younger. There were three sisters, my 
m om ,her younger sister, each isf ive years apart.  My younger aunt was quite a 
bit younger.  She worked. She was also inachurch. She worked 
--
 
also, when 
the Americans cam e, she started working actually with the Am ericans.
  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ar would continue in Europe until May of 1945, so a lot longer.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 

>>
 
Bill Benson:  Do you know if there was fear the Germ ansm ight com e back, or 
did everybody at that point,do you think they felt really f ree and liberated?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ithink Belgium felt liberated. T he Am ericansand the allieshad 
liberated Belgium , andI think wef elt cautious, but very safe. If elt safe, certainly, 
as a child.  I was with m y two aunts. Ifelt safe with m y three cousins.  So Ifelt 
ver y saf ebeing with them .  
 
>> Bill Benson: W as that a period of hardship, because they were trying to 

resume their lives, and food?  
 

23 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Of course. T hey hada store, and their apartm entwas behind 
the store,and it was very hard starting to work again, opening your business, 
getting enoughmoney for food andeverything else. So lif e
 
wa s d iff icu lt.  Ye t,m y 
aunt took me in.  I was just part of thef am ily.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Itm ust have seemed likeam iracle that yourm other was able to 
survi ve and return in April of 1945, af ter shewas liberated.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Absolutely.  You know, m y m other andher m other were 

deportedat the same tim e.  They were arrested.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Som ebody denounced them , didn'tthey?  
 
>> Josie T raum : W e talk about wonderf ul people in Belgium , the churches, the 
nuns. T here were som any wonderf ul people.  But there were many people who 
denounced Jews, who would get m oney for telling the Germans where the Jews 
live d .   
 
 
So I was saved, really,  by m any, many people.  However, neighbors 
denouncedm y m om , said where she lived, and they f ound her, and they arrested 

her and deportedher,her andm y grandm other.  
 
 
Som y m other was taken to Auschwitz.  M y grandf ather, by the way, died 
bef ore he got to Auschwit z.  He died on oneof the cattle cars,on the wa y to 
A u sch wit z.   
 
 
My m other and grandm other, as soon as they got to Auschwitz, they had a 
selection where they put people who were healthier and younger inone line and 

24 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
people who were a little bitelderly, like m y gr andm other, whom usthave been in 
her late 40s.  
 
Most concentration cam ps, you got there, they killed you.  Auschwitz 
hada subcam p, which was a labor cam p.  It was called Birkenau. So they 
actually would putpeople who were younger, m ore healthy looking,onto the 
labor cam p.  Som y m other and herm otherwere separated imm ediately, as soon 
a
s they got to Auschwi tz.  Andm y m other went to runto be with herm other,and 
the German really hit her hardand said, " Yougo where you're told." Sheactually 

never saw her m otheragain.  
 
 
So, luckily, m y m other survived, andm y grandparents did not.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas it like f or you to have your m other come back?  
 
>> Josie T raum : W ell, firstof all, m y m otherwas ver y, ver y sick wh en she was 

liberated.  She was liberated by the Russians.  Different concentration camps 
were liberated by differentarm ies.  Auschwitz was liberatedby the Soviets, by 
the Soviet Union.  Sowhen she was liberated, she was taken to ahospital by the 
Russians. She was pretty sick.  She had typhus andm eningitis, and eventually 
the Red Cross brought her back down to
 
Belgium . And she got back to Belgium , 
thef irstplace she went was her sister's house. She knockedonthe door, and 

there I was.  So we were reunited. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Up until thatpoint, she probably had no idea you were there, 

none whatsoever.  
 

25

>> 
Josie T raum :  No.Shehad no idea.  AndI didn't know abouther.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other's experience was just 
beyond
 
description what she 
went through. She was very ill when she cam eback. At whatpoint was she able 
to begin to really take care 
of yo u?   
 
>> Josie T raum : W ell, I think probably ver y s oon, even though shewas sick, she 

really did take care of me.  My dad didn't com ebackf rom England until 1946, a 
year af ter the war. W here he was living in England, abom bfell on his house and 
he 
was in ahospital for two years.  So he really couldn't com e backuntil he was 
healed.  He did com eback in 1946,and of  course, I didn't rem em ber him  

because I was 13m onths old when he lef t.  Iwas 7 years old whenhe cam e 
back. So it was really like m eeting up with a stranger.  Form y m om ,too,I think.  
T hey, all three of us, had very diff erent experiences, and Ithink it took a while, a 
long, long while to becom e used to eachother again.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather came back in1946, so betterpartof  ayear af ter your 

m om  got back. W hat was
 
--
 
do you know what lif e was likef orher to re
-
establish 
her own life, without yourf atherf or that year period, and with you? W hat was 

thattim e like?  
 
>>
 
Josie T raum : W ell, f irstofall, I started going to school. I was too young, I 
couldn't go to school anyhow during the war.  I started going to school, and I had 
som e kindof  regularity and scheduletom y life.  
 
 
My m om , I think, tried to establish herself .W e had a store.  The 

26 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
apartm ent house we lived in had a storeon the bottom f loor. My dad used to 
have a shopthere, which he opened again whenhe came back.  My m other 
started working a little bit with dressm aking, and Ithink she relied a lot on h
e r 
sist e r.   
 
 
Eventually, our life becam e som ewhat normal.  Oncem y dad cameback, 
m y parents bothfelt they really wanted to leave Europe, and they wanted to 

com e tothe United States.  So they appliedfor visas and papers,and in 1949 we 
actually 
--
 
I  wa
s 10 years old, in1949 we came tothis country.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout thatm ore, I'm going to take you backa 

little bit.  You remem ber actually waiting f or yourf ather when he disembarked. 
T ell us about that,becausethat's one of your real memories. Butalso a little bit 
about what happened to him, up until the time he came back.  I'm not sure what 
point yourm other knew he was ali ve. W hathappenedduring his tim e?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  During his tim e,f irst of all, I think Im entionedthe British when 

he cam e to volunteer in England, he volunteered in af actory m aking British 
unif orm s, he andhis brother were making British uniform s.  Once hewas injured 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  From the bomb thatfell on the house?  
 
>> Josie T raum : W hen the bombf ellonhishouse, we pretty m uch lost contact.  

He had been writing to m y m other at the endof  the war.

27

>> Josie T raum :  1945, he was writing to m y m other. Butprior tothat, we really, 
th e
re was no contact whatsoever.  My m otherdidn't know if he was alive, and he 
didn't know if  we were alive.  So it was purely by stroke of  great luckthat we were 

reunited.  
 
 
My f ather came back. There's aport, Astandin Belgium , wheretheships 
com e in,
 
it'sa port city.  My dad cam ebackf rom England, andm y m om  andI 
went to wait for him  atthe port.W esaw him com ing down the gangplank,and 

m y m other of course knew imm ediately who he was.  She said," There's your 
father."  Of  course,to m e he was a total stranger.  I was 7 years old. T his was a 
m an I don't remember, becausehe left whenI was so young.  That's how If irst 
m et him.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would live together asafam ily for three years bef ore you 

ca m e to th e Un ited  S tate s. W hat wa s th
at period like? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ithink it was ver y diff icult. It was a lot of readjustm ent and 

adjustm entfor all of us.  My m other had gone throughhell, really, and sohad m y 
father, in a different way.  M y m other had losther parents, she had lost much of 
herf am ily, and it was very, very hard.  It was a hard adjustment.  
 
 
I remember
 
--
 
I rem ember m y mother having nightm aresand crying and 
scream ing during thenight.  So it was ver y, very hardf orm y parents to become 
readjusted to eachother, not just to eachother butthen tom e. It was like, ina

Josie T raum :  Bill, he knows how to getm e.  My m other tellsm e,because 
there's so many things I don't rem em ber.  Imean, I was 6 years oldwhen I saw

>> Bill Benson:  1949, you make another huge change.  You come to the United 

States.  T ell us about that.

W elived with m y m other's aunt about am onth, till m y parentsfound an

then in the third grade.  I f inally caught up.

you really pick up the language very quick l y.  My parents were ver y em phatic.  At 

home we would speak French,but whenI cam ehom ef rom school I would speak 
English to them , because they really wantedm eto. As soonas we got to this 
country, to New

learn English, they wanted to learnhistory, they wantedtobecom eAm ericans.  

So I spoke English to them when I came home.  
 
 
By the way, Bill did not m ention,m y m other is still alive.  She's96.W hich

But they weren't. T hey really beat m eup. I cam e home, of course, I was cr ying.  
My m other went to school the next day, in her broken English, whatever she

it's because these girls thought that I was Germ an.  
 
 
No w

>> Hi,  J o s ie .   
 
>> J o s ie  T rau m :  Hi.
  
 
>> T hank youf or taking the time to do this. My question is,how did the Germans 
know that you were in the convent? Did they have some kind of connections?  
Because, you said they knew, they were coming f or thefour children.  How did 
they know you were there?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In case the f olks in the backdidn'thear, the question is when 

Josie was in the convent and thenuns had inform ation that it was going to be 
raided,how did they know that?

>> Josie T raum :  First, the Germans were very organi zed.  All the Jews in 
Belgium  and in most European countries wer e actually registered in the 
synagogues, in the Jewish com m unity centers. T he Germ ans really knew where 
m ostof the Jews li ved.  
 
 
T hey also had a lotof  inside information. T hey knew that 
convents and 
nunsand Christianpeople were hiding Jews.  So whether they hadpeople 

workin g with them , people denouncingf orm oney, for whatever reasons,butthey 
knew there were Jewish kids being hidden in the convent.  
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  P e riodic a lly,  p r
obably had raids and m usthave known that one 
was going to eventually com e nom atter what.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  OK. Thank you very m uch.W ehave a questionback there.  Do 
we have one right here?  Yes, right there.  Young m an.  
 
>> 
I was going to say, who or what kept yougoing through the Holocaust?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Excuse me?
 
>>W ho or what kept you going through all of this?  Itm usthave been pretty 

hard.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  How did she get through it all?
 

>> Ye s .   
 
>> J o s i e  T r a
um :  Asachild, you don't question many things.  I was used to 
things the way they we re.  Ididn't know lif e inany other way.  I knew I was in

hiding.  Didn't know wh at it was like not to be in hiding. Soas a child, you don't 
question those things as muchas you do anadult.  
 
 
I think you'd get adifferent answer if  you askedm y m om  what kepther 
going and what kept the adults going.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  One ofthe things I recall you saying to m ethef irst time I talked 

to you about this, Josie, you said whenthe war ended, there you wer e with your 
aunt, your words were "I was just a child whoreally needed to be held."  Yeah. 
OK .  
 
 
W ehave right back there.  No, backhere, then to you with them ic. OK.  
 
>> Can you hearm e? Josie, youm entioned that
 
yourm other was deported to 
A u sch wit z.   
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> From  there, she went to a subcam pf or labor, Birkenau.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 

>>W hat typeof  labordid she do there?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Actually, she went daily toBirkenau. T hey would
 
take the 
prisoners daily, then back toAuschwitz.  She was working in an amm unition 
factory.  She was f illing grenadesand bombs. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Exceptionally, exceptionally brutal circum stances.She tells me 
thather eyebrows andeyelashes burned off and would turn yellow b ecause of 
the chem icals.  It was pretty hard.

>> Bill Benson:  OK.  A question right here. A m ic com ing to you.  
 
>> Josie, thank you so m uch. I'd like to ask you a question that I'veasked some 
other survi vors, and that is may
be f or you and f or your other fam ily m em bers, 
could you tell me maybe would you say that with your experiencesand your 

m other's experiences, has this all beena God

aff irm ing experiencefor you or a 
Go d
-
denying experience f or you?  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he question, if  youdidn'thear in the back, is really the im pact 
f rom a religious perspective f or you, if I can put it that way.  
 
>> Ye s .   
 
>> Josie T raum : T hat's a very hard question.  Right now, I'm anobservant 
personand Ibelieve in God. T here aretoo
 
many good things and wonderful 
things that arehappening in this world tom ake mef eel that there isa God.  Many 

people, after the Holocaust,had a very diff icult tim e believing in God.  You know, 
how could thishave all happened if there was a God? 
 
 I  
don't know.  If eelthat I do believe in God, and Iam observant, to som e 
extent, traditionally as a Jew.  And I think it'sm adem ea strong person.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you. T hank you. W ehave one right in themiddle here, 

then one over there. Let's do them iddle right here.T he m ic is com ing f rom  your 
other side. There you go.  Thanks, Kristin. 
 
>> Hi, Josie.  I was wondering, when did your m om  start talking to you about her 

36 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
experiences inAuschwitz? W hat was it likef or you, when you f irstheard it, what 
your m om went through in Auschwitz?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you hear that OK?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Idid. Actually, shedidnot start speaking tom ef orm any,m any 

years af ter that. As Im entionedbefore, I rem em ber during the night her having 
nightm ares, and running through the apartm ent scream ing and crying, and I 
didn't quite understand m any of the things she was going through. As a child, I 
couldn't understand, because Im yself  was having a diff icult time readjusting to 
lif eand to everything else.  
 
 
I know she tried to speak to some relatives, and they didn't wanttohear 
her. T hey would actually sa y, "W edon't want to hear about that. T hat was in the 
past,and that's bad.  Things are different now."   
 
 
Som y m om  actually didn't talkf or
 
a long, long tim e,for many years.  In 
fact, I think she only really started talking about her history in the
 
--
 
when she was 
90 years old.  Here,Iwould think, I think it'sbecause of them useum . It gave her 

a place that she could actually talk andfeel comfortable about talking.  But I, she 
didn't
 
--
 
what Idid, I did a lot of reading when I was ver y young, and I read as 
m uch as I could, f rom  different experiences from  EliW iesel, f rom  different people 

thathave gonethrough the Holocaust, and Ikind of surm ised whatshe had gone 
through. Littleby little she tells us.

>> Bill Benson:  Over here, this gentlem an.  
 
>> T hank you.  Your story is heart
-
rending.  It's wonderful.  Thank youf or sharing 
your story.  
 
>> Josie T raum : T hank you.  
 
>>
 
M y question is, we hear m uch about the scars of  the childrenand 
grandchildrenof  the Holocaust survivors.  In your years of  social work, I wonder if  
you m ight tell us a little m ore about what the scars are,and how serious are they 
for the children and grandchildrenof  the survivors?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Doesthat
 
--
 
OK.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yeah.  T hat's a very, ver y bi g question.  First of all, let me tell 

you, I can tell you aboutm y experience or how I f eel.  Iam not only a childof a 
survi vor, but I'm a
 
survivor m yself .  So I have like a double whamm y.  And 
because of that, I think I've been very, ver y overprotective with m y children.  
 
 
I am  so worried that som ething m ight happen, even though they m ight be 
ver y, very saf e. But I think children do havea lotof  scars. I've heard children 

say, who are now adults, whose parentsm ade them be saf e and letthem  go 
away, or m adethem  go away, and those children are angry because they were 
gi ven away, not realizi ng thatthe parents,how hard it was f or theparents to give 
up the childrenfor them  to be safe.  
 
 
So thereare scars,I think, that are broughtf rom  generation to generation.  
T here really are.

You know, you're af raid.  I, growin g up asa child, was a very good little 
girl.  I was af raid to get m y
 
parents angry, becauseI f elt that they had suffered so 
m uch.  How couldI doanything to hurt them? So it works in many,m any 
d iffe re nt wa ys.  
 
 
And then, of course, I went into social work,andI worked with abused and 
neglected children.  I wonder why
.  
 
[Laughter]
 
So there's an im pact.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your daughter is a psychologist, right?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Apsychiatrist.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Psychiatrist.  Excusem e, she's a psychiatrist.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes,she is.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I think
 
you toldm eone time she said, " You've given m ea whole 
lo t to
 
--
" 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes," Given me a lot of material, mom ."   
 
>> Bill Benson:  I can im agine you were an extraordinary social wor ker with 

abused children.  
 
>> Josie T raum : T hank you.  
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Very lucky kids to have you work with them , I'm sure.  
 
>> Josie T raum : T hank you.

>> Bill Benson: W e're going to close inam om ent. I'll turn back toJosie to close.  
I want to thank all of you for being here.  I remind you that we'll have a 
F i rs t  
Person
 
program  each W ednesday and Thursday until the m iddle of  August, and 
welcom e you back atany tim e. Soplease join usagain if  you can.  
 
 
W hen Josie isf inished, she's going to step down f rom the stage.  If  
anybody wants to come, say hi,
 
m eet her, get a photograph taken wi th her, 
please dothat.  
 
So with that, it's our traditionat 
F i rs t  P e rso n
 
that our f irst person has 
the last word.  So with that, I'm going to turn back to Josie to close today's 
program .  
 
>> J o s ie  T rau m :  O K.  B ill,  y
ou know what m y last word is? T his is alwa ys m y 
favorite.  Onthe second floor,I don't know if any of  you have been through the 
m useum  yet, but on the secondf loor,as youleave the secondf loor, there'sa big 
quote on the wall, whic h I think is so meaningful and really explains what the 
m useum  is about andwhat your f uture generationsneed to be doing.  It's a quote 
by Martin Niem oller, aLutheranm inister, andit says, " First they camefor the 
socialists.  Ididnot speak outbecause I was nota socialist. T hen they cam ef or 
the trade Unionists.  Idid not speakoutbecause I was not a tradeUnionist.  
T hen they cam efor the Jews.  I did not speak outbecause I was not a Jew.  
T hen they cam efor me.  And there was no one left to speakfor me."   
 
 
And this, tom e,embodies what ourtaskand our duty is.  You need to

because they look different, they're a different color, they're wearing the wrong 
sneakers, or whatever.  
 
 
P le a

people intervened.
