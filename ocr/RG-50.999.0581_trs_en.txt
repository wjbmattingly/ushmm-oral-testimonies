Agi was  bor n Agnes  Laszlo in 1930 in Budapes t, Hungar y. This  map highlights  Hungary. 
 
 
The arr ow on this  m ap points  to Budapest. 
 
 
Agi was  one of two daughter s of Ros alia and Zoltan Las zlo. Here we s ee Agi and her s is ter
, 
Zs uzs i. They s pent the fir s t s ix year s  of their lives in a farming village wher e their father managed a 

lar ge farm.
 
Here we s ee Agi's parents , Ros alia and Zoltan. 
 
 
Due to her father's  failing health and anti
-
Semitic legis lation pr ohibiting J ews  from working in 
agr ic ultur e busines s , the fam ily moved to Mis kolc  where Agi's mother m anaged a boardinghous e.
 
This  
photo is  of the hom e.
 
 
The
 
arr ow on this  m ap of Hungary points  to Mis kolc.
 
 
On Mar c h 19, 1944, the s am e day Germ an forc es  oc c upied Hungar y, Agi's  father died. Agi, 
her  sister and mother  joined a gr oup of 30 J ews  s ent to work in the fields  outs ide the town. After  a 
 

2 
 
m
onth they r eturned to Mis kolc where they lived in the ghetto for  a few weeks befor e being c onfined to 
a brick  factor y on the outs kirts of town.
 
 
The following month, the fam ily was depor ted to Aus c hwitz. This map depic ts  the deportations  
of J ews  from Hungar ian ghettos to
 
Aus c hwitz.
 
 
Later, Agi, her m other and s is ter  wer e interned at the Plas zow c onc entration c am p. The arr ow 
on this map of m ajor Nazi c amps s hows  the loc ation of Plas zow. When the Soviet Arm y appr oac hed 
Plas zow in the fall, the entir e c amp, inc luding the three wom en, wer e s ent bac k  to Aus c hwitz for  a few 
weeks  then wer e m oved to s everal labor c amps .
 
 
On A pr il
 
28, 1945, Agi was  liberated by Am er ic an s oldier s . This  photo of Agi is fr om 1950, 
after  s he emigr ated to Israel.
 
 
Today Agi r es ides in the Washington, D.C. ar ea. She moved to the United States  13 year s  
ago after living in Isr ael sinc e 1949
, w
her e she worked in the insur anc e field for  32 year s . She has two 
c hildren, a daughter , Dorit, who lives  her e, and a s on, J ohnn
ie
, who lives  in Isr ael. She has four  
gr
andc hildr en and four gr eat gr andc hildr en. Agi speaks four languages fluently: Hebrew, Hungar ian, 
Germ an and Englis h.
 
 
With that, I would like to as k  you
 
to
 
join me in welc om ing Mrs .
 
Agi Geva.
 
> > [Applaus e]
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  Agi, thank you s o muc h for joining us and for  your  willingnes s to s pend time with 

us . In a s hor t hour, you have s o muc h to tell us so that we'r e going to get started r ight away.
 
 
I'd like to s tar t by talking about your  life, your c ommunity, and your fam ily in the years  befor e 
the war. Can you tell me about that?
 
> > Agi Geva:  The fir st s ix year s  my s is ter
,  Zsuzsi,  
and I s pent at the farm . My dad was the d
ir ec tor of 
the plac e. We had quite a nic e
 
--
 
norm al fo
r  us. My 
par ents  br ought German nannies  to c are for us  s o 
we s poke fluent Germ an. My dad kept telling us  to know the language well bec aus e we need 
s om ething that c an't be taken away fr om  us .
 
Later it pr oved r eally us eful.
 
 
Then we m oved to Mis kolc , as Ales ia m entioned. My mother had to provide for us bec aus e 
m y dad had a hear t attack  that he never , ever r ecovered c ompletely. He was  fir ed in 1936 from his  job. 
Anti
-
Semitism was n't that m uc h that year , ac tually , that it s hould c ome to this  but that's what happened.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  Ear lier  you told m e that you went to s c hool in an unus ual way. How did you get to 
s c hool?
 
> > Agi Geva:  Yes. That was  in 1935. We went to sc hool with hor s e and car riage. There was  a carriage 
with two hor s es. And in the winter  ther e were warm  br icks  under  our feet and blankets on our  knees . 
That's how we went
 
to s chool.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  A little differ ent.
 
> > Agi Geva:  A little different.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  You said you learned Germ an. Did
 
you 
als o learn Englis h?
 
> > Agi Geva:  When we were 10, m y dad thought that we s hould start another language and we 

le
ar ned Englis h
, a
ctually. And at s c hool we learned Fr ench, Latin. What else?  I think that's  it.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So the Nazis , as  I m entioned before, but the Nazis oc c upied Hungary on Mar c h 
19, 1944, whic h was  a ver y im portant day in your life. And you alluded to this  alr eady. This  was  the day 
that your father died. Can you tell m e about what happened then and then you went on to work in the 
fields and then in the ghetto.
 
> > Agi Geva:  That day was  really very traum atic . My dad died on that day. And later we got news  that 

the family from  Budapes t c ouldn't c om e to the funeral. My m om under stood that we were unoc c upied 
and nobody c ould travel out of the c ities  no mor e, no Jewis h people.
 
When we c ame back  from the 
funeral, ever y c or ner ther e was  a Germ an s oldier with a gun. And it was  really s c ar y. Changed our lives  
c om pletely in the next few days . We had to wear 
a yellow
 
s tar. Every J ewis h per s on had to wear a 
yellow s tar  on our  jacket or  blous es. And we were really, r eally s c ar ed.
 

 
There were rum ors  that wh
o was  ready to work in the fields  and went to the munic ipality to 
s wear  loyalty to Hungar y will not be depor ted. So m y m om organized s ome fr iends , 30, 35 fr iends , and 
we went to the fields . Then a few weeks  it was  really tr aum atic. It was  very hard to get up at 5:00
 
in the 

3 
 
m or ning and stay in the fields  till the evening and do hard job that we never did befor e. But we didn't 
think  that will be the eas ies t
 b
ut came later.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So from there you worked in the fields for  a few week s  hoping that you wer en't 

going to be deported but next c am e the ghetto.
 
> > Agi Geva:  One day they jus t told us that this m or ning we don't go to the fields , we ar e going bac k  to 

Mis kolc . And we under s tood that they went back on their pr omis e that we won't be deported. 
W
e were 
not s ure yet.We wer e taken to the ghetto. That meant a s mall apar tm ent with five, s ix families . It was  
c r owded. It was  tr aumatic . It was  unc omfortable. It was  everything. I c an jus t tell you, it was  not enough 
food. There was  not enough water . Ever ything. We thought the wor s t was  going to happen to us .
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  However
, s
o the Nazis  oc c upied Mis kolc  in Mar c h 1944. By the m iddle of J une you 
were in a ghetto. And then you were taken to a bric k  fac tor  for deportation.
 
> > Agi Geva:  Yes.
 
>> 
Ales ia Fis hman:  And there wer e going to be trains  waiting to take you. 
 
> > Agi Geva:  The brick fac tory was  ac tually a plac e that had no s ides  in walls . It only a c eiling, a r oof. 
That m eant we c ould have es c aped, but my mom  was  afr aid that we are going to be s een and one of 
us  m ight not make it. And s he was  s car ed all the time that we s hould s tay together . So s he does n't ris k  
to es c ape. 
 
 
So we wer e waiting there for trains . And we thought the tr ains would be like trains  that you 
us ually travel in, with windows  and s eats, and s andwic hes , and c onvers ations .We wer e not afr aid of 

this  at all. But when the tr ains  c ame, what we s aw, thes e were c attle c ar s.We c ould never, ever 
imagine that they c an put people into thes e c attle c ar s  and tr avel in them. But that's  what happened. 
 
 
There were s oldiers with guns all around us . We had to get into thes e c ars . Standing plac es, 
put in as many people as they c ould and c los ed the door on us. Ther e was  only a s mall opening on the 

r oof for light and air that was  really not
 
s uffic ient. And the train s tarted to move. And it was  the worst of 
the wors t part. Of c ours e, I would have been happier  back  in the ghetto as  unc omfor table as it was . 

There were pr egnant people, s ick people, teenager s , small c hildr en. People wer e hys ter ic
al c rying. 
They c ouldn't stop c r ying. They c ouldn't stop yelling. Som e fainted. It was  an im pos s ible s ituation that I 

c an't even desc r ibe well enough.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  How long was the trip?  Do 
you r ec all? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  It was thr ee days . And we didn't know when it was  day, when it was  night. It's  

indes c r ibable
. We thought it was  the wors t of the wors t s ituation.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And when the trains  finally s topped, wher e were you and what did you s ee? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  Wherever we were we didn't know.
 
We wer e in Aus c hwitz but we had no idea what it 
m eant.We didn't know that it was  a death c am p. We didn't know it was  a c amp at all. We jus t didn't 
know.
 
 
What we saw was  that in minutes  they s eparated the men from  the wom en, in m inutes.We 
don't even kno
w how it c ould happen s o quickly. So a new hys teric s  started. People wanted to s ay 
goodbye to their br others, husbands, s ons . They begged the s oldier s  to do s o. And in another few 

m inutes they wer e gone. They wer e jus t taken out of the station and we never
 
knew wher e they wer e 
going.
 
And the wom en went in a different dir ection.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And it was  r eally impor tant for your  m other
 
--
 
s he s tar ted to realize, r ight, that it 
was
 
--
 
people needed to look like they c ould wor k  or  c ould work and s o what did s he do? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  Actually when m y m om s aw what's  happening, she was  r eally, r eally s or ry that s he didn't 
tr y to es c ape fr om the br ic k  fac tory. Everything would have been better, s he s aid.
 
But here s he started 
to go
 
--
 
at a c ertain point, all of us  to go but she wanted to be ther e befor e to have a good look what's  
going to happen and what's going on ther e. She told us  jus t to walk with the group. She will go to the 

beginning of the line, find out, and c om e back  to tell us .
 
 
Of c ours e, s he was  under  gun point. She took  a real risk. But s he thought the risk would be 
worth if s he didn't know what was  happening and it turned out s he was  r ight.
 
She s aw Germ an SS 
s elec ting the groups  that c am e in fr ont of them. And s he s aw that fam ilies  were tor n apar t i
mmediately. 
When a gir l was  begging an offic er to pleas e let her  stay with her  m other or vic e vers a, they 

4 
 
imm ediately s eparated between them. They didn't even give a c hanc e. And then s he s aw that all older 
people, s ick people, people with a c hild on their ar m, wer e s ent to the left s ide. She had no idea what it 
m eant at that tim e. And she s aw that to the right s ide wer e able
-
bodied people, mor e or  les s the s am e 
age. And then s he heard that under 16, everybody was  s ent ultimately to the left s ide. She didn't
 
k now 
at that point what it meant. 
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And s o your  m other tried to m ake s ure you all went to the s ame s ide.
 
> > Agi Geva:  She figured that we will not s ay our r eal age, that was  12 and 13. We will s ay 18 and 19. 

They might s elect us to be together. So s he told us  to take out our s c ar ves  and bind it in a way on our 
head that will m ake us look  older. And it was  that way. It m ight m ake m e look  older even now.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Agi Geva:  And then s he wound her  head in another way that s he thought it would make her look  

younger . It was  that way. So it m ight have been helpful, very helpful bec aus e all thr ee of us wer e 
s elec ted together  to go to the right s ide. It was  s uc h and joy and s uc h a r elief when we found we wer e 
all together again but it was n't very long lasting.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And you told m e that you had a bag with you. What did you take?  You c ould bring 

a bag. What did you take? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  We c ould take a bag, we wer e told to go to our  r ooms  befor e we left the hous e and jus t 

ta
ke stuff that we c an c arry. So I per s onally took a book I was  reading, a new watc h, a doll, a dr es s. I 
don't know what my s is ter  took.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And your m other? What did adults  tak e?  What did the grown
-
ups  take? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  We didn't know a
t the tim e but it turned out that they took jewels , papers, doc um ents, 
pic tures, fam ily pic tures, m oney. They thought it m ight be helpful for br iber y or  anything els e.
 
 
And we had to put down our  bags, ther e was  s uch hys teric s , crying, begging to hold on t
o 
them but, of c our s e, the soldiers  pointed their guns  at us  and told us put it down and we had to.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  Can you tell me, als o, a little bit about the food that you had there and the bunks ? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  I think  befor e, I have to tell you what happened. The next room  we had to undres s 

c om pletely and leave all of our dr es s es in another c orner . The hys teric s  and the c r ying and the 
beggings  wer e even wors e than ever before bec aus e when the grownups , inc luding m y mom, thought 

that they m ight ta
ke the bags away, then at leas t their c lothes  will s tay on and they had in their pockets  
and in the lining of their dres s es s ewn in all of thes e jewels , m oneys, family pic tur es . And when we had 

to undr es s , it was  our last hope of ever  having anything that was  c onnec ted to home or to s ave us 
s om ehow.
 
 
So that was  going on ther e. I c an't even des cr ibe to you. We were s tanding ther e without 
c lothes . It was  very humiliating and ver y unc omfor table. We never s aw our mom  and her friends
 
--
 
it 
was  very hum iliating.
 
But then m or e humiliations  followed. We wer e s haved from all hair on our body. 
When we looked at eac h other, we c ouldn't even rec ognize eac h other. It was  terr ible. And as if this  

was n't enough, we wer e s pr ayed with a dis infec tant that only animals  wer e spr ayed with. We k new no 
hum ans  c ould be sprayed like this . So I c an't desc ribe you really what it felt like.
 
 
And then we were s ent into the s howers . We didn't know that we were luc ky, ver y lucky
 t
hat 
fr om  our  s hower c ame water.We didn't k now that in the other  barr acks , I mean on the left s ide, where 

other people wer e s ent, it c am e gas . We didn't know it then
 a
nd neither did m y m om. So it was  s c ar y. 
Not enough that tim e but we didn't know when we found out. 
 
 
Then we were taken to another plac e wher e we had to c hoos e a piec e of clothes  and a pair of 
s hoes . Nothing els e. No under wear , no s ocks, nothing. J us t a dr es s and a pair of s hoes . Whether it fit 

or  not, it was  absolutely not im por tant to anyone.
 
 
Then we were given bowls  and blankets and taken to our barr acks. And the bunks  that looked 
like that. Five, six, s even people on eac h bunk .When s om eone wanted to get up, all the s ix, s even had 

to get up and s omeone wanted to tur n over, everybody els e had to tur n over. It was  horr ible. But we 
had to do it.
 
>> A
les ia Fis hm an:  And fr om Aus c hwitz, you were s elec ted for s lave labor and s ent to Plas zow.
 

5 
 
> > Agi Geva:  The s elec tions  wer e r eally s c ar y. Every s ingle day we were 
c ounted. W
e were s tanding 
outs ide in lines  for hour s until the k apos , the Germ ans , c am e and started to count us . And then after , it 
was  daily in Aus c hwitz there wer e s elec tions. And one day we wer e all selec ted together , at leas t my 
m om and s is ter and I, and were s ent to the r ailway s tation again, to the c attle c ars  again. This  time it 
took one hour.We went to Plas zow.
 
That was  a cam p wher e the 
ﬁ
Sc hindler 's 
L
is t
ﬂ 
was  filmed. We had 
a ver y, ver y hard tim e there.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So they for c ed you to m ove roc k s  there. Is  that c or rect?
 
> > Agi Geva:  That was  our  daily work, to pick up rock s , take them up a hill and the next day to bring 
them back  down. Bec aus e als o not only humiliating, it was  degr ading and it was  very har d work.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  You eventually went back to Ausc hwitz and fac ed even m or e s elections  when you 

r eturned.
 
>> Agi Gev
a:  Yes. Plas zow, I jus t wanted to tell you, ther e wer e not only pr is oner s  like us  but it was  a 
c am p als o of m urder
er
s, burglar s fr om the pr is ons.We were s c ared not only fr om the Germ ans but als o 
fr om  our  fellow pris oner s .We had to look behind us . It was
 
r eally s c ar y.
 
 
Then we were taken
 
--
 
when we heard the c annon s hots, we thought the Rus s ians  ar e maybe 
liberating us , com ing to the c am p. But then the Ger m ans quickly liquidated the c am ps  and we were 
s ent back  to the railway s tation. This  time we were r ea
lly s c ared. We wer e ver y weak. We looked very 
bad
, h
opeles s. This wagon tr ip took  one day. My m om tried to c ons ole us  that we have been thr ough 
the wors t places  alr eady, to Aus c hwitz to Plas zow. It c an't be wor s e, s he said. But when the doors  
opened and we
 
s imply s aw where we were and it was  bac k  in Aus c hwitz. It was  really s om ething that 
we never , ever  thought it m ight happen.We wer e m or e hopeles s  than ever.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And what happened in that selec tion ther e? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  My mom  saw
 
--
 
ther e 
was  one officer s electing s urrounded by s oldier s , keeping their 
guns on the per son who was  s elected. She told us  that bec aus e we ar e in s uc h bad c ondition, s he 

think s  s he's  in the bes t condition, s he will go first and m y s is ter s ec ond, and I looked wors e t
han the 
two of them, I s hould be the thir d. She took a
 
big c hanc e her e to tell us  f
ollow m e wher ever  I will be 
s ent
 a
nd in c as e it's  im pos s ible, then ask  for  a working c am p. The Germ ans  will need wor kers  all the 
tim e s o jus t tr y.
 
 
The 
s elec ting offic er  was
 
Mengele. We had no idea who he was  at that time.We found out but 
we didn't know. So he s ent my mom  to the r ight. And then he s ent m y s is ter to the r ight. And me he 
s ent to the left. A
nd I looked at him and I s aid, Pleas e, no, pleas e, I would like to go t
o that s ide, 
pointing to the right. And he asked m e
, W
hy, what is  there?  I told him it's a work  being c am p. Then he 
r ealized he was  talking German. He s aid you are a Hungarian tr ans port. That's what they c alled us  all 

the tim e, tr ans port. "How c an you s peak  Germ an?"  And her e is  the point my dad was  right. Had I not 
s poken German, I wouldn't have m ade it. And he s om ehow liked the idea. He told m e, H ow do you 
s peak  Germ an?  Started to ask ques tions. He told me, 
ﬁO
k, 
go to the r ight.
ﬂ 
Then m y m om s aw the 
c on
vers ations . She was  s ure s he would never , ever  s ee m e again and knew exac tly what was  going to 

happen to me. She fainted. When I got there, s he didn't even know that I was  s afe. 
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So people s om etim es ask you wer e you afr aid of him, the w
ell
-
known
 
--
 
> > Agi Geva:  People ask  m e, wer en't you afraid of Mengele, talking to him ?  I s aid, no, I was  afr aid of 

my mom.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Agi Geva:  She told us  what to do and I was suppos ed to do what s he wanted m e to do.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So at one point your m other had you r emove your glas s es
. W
hy did s he do that? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  Ther e wer e s elec tions , as I told you, daily. And there was  for fac tor y workers  in 
Germ any. Sometim es  they looked at strong feet, s tr ong hands , str ong eyes . They looked at

My m om  s aid take off my glas s es , fold into the s ide of her s hoe to hide it, that I s houldn't look  different 

than everybody els e and we s hould be able to stay together. And the glas ses  we br ought back . I don't 
know how s he did it. I was  s aved bec

> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  Another s tor y you wer e telling m e about, while you were there, is  the s tory of Lily, 
who was  an opera s inger. And s he was  in the c amp with you.

> > Agi Geva:  Yes. Als o with her s is ter  and her mother was  s ent to the left s ide
 
of the s elections  and 
s he was  really des per ate and ver y s ad. She was  s om e 10 years older than my s is ter  and I. We found 
out that s he was  an opera s inger in m y hom etown, in Mis kolc . We s tarted to ask her  m aybe to s ing for 
us . She was  s o s ad and s o weak and
 
s o hungry and s o des per ate and s o everything that it took  a long 
tim e to per s uade her. But when s he started to s ing, I c an't even tell you what it meant to all of us . If I 

c los e m y eyes , I just thought I'm back  in the opera hous e in Mis kolc  lis tening to opera. She s ang 

beautifully. After  a c ouple of days  s he did s ing
 
to
 
us  and als o the Germ ans  were touc hed by it and 
in
v ited her to s ing in their headquarters.We were s c ar ed ever y tim e when s he had to go whether she 
would c ome back.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So you'r e back to Aus c hwitz the s ec ond time. And fr om  ther e they do a s election 

for a work c amp in Roc hlitz. And that was  late 1944.What happened when they took  you?  Ther e was  

a s elec tion. How m any people went and what did you do when you got to Roc hlitz?

a

after thr ee days

tr ip in the wagon, it was  wor s e than I c ould imagine 
fr om  all the tr ips  bec ause it was  winter. It was  s o c old. We wer e s o not pr epared
 
--
 
we had no c lothes . 
We had no food. We had no water . We had nothing to keep us  warm. And this  trip was  danger ous . We 
thought we'll never m ake it without getting s ome par t of us  fr ozen. But s omehow we did it. And when 
we g
ot to Roc hlitz, it was  a r elief to know that we were in a s c hool, ac tually, wher e we were s tudying 
how to make things for  the factory.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And you told m e while you were in the sc hool, you ended up with a penc il and 

piec e of paper.

> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Agi Geva:  I was  r eally even mor e happy. I found mys elf being r es pons ible and a human being 
again. In Aus c hwitz, bec am e the s ec ond tim e, actually, we had nothing but 
hum iliation. They tattooed 
on our
 l
eft arm  a number, that we wer e s uppos ed to be just this  num ber. And it s aid Aus c hwitz
,  
and the 
letter of A
, 
and the num ber. And when I got to Roc hlitz and held this  pencil, I felt human again. We 
were s itting on c hairs , in front of tables  that we hadn't done the whole year before.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So you wer e telling m e, too, that you wer e m aking s c rews  for  air plane parts  and 
your  mother  engaged in s om e ac ts of s abotage while you were there.
 
> > Agi Geva:  Fr om Rochlitz we were sent to Stuttgart and Stuttgart to the fac tory. And that was  the 

r eal factory where the s crews  really went out to the air planes . My s is ter was  working at the c ontrol 
panels . I was  m aking the s c rews , ac tually. And my mom was  c ontr olling
 
--
 
was  at the filing s tone wher e 
if the s crew was  too s mall, they were thrown away. And if they were too big, then s he c ould file them  to 
the actual s ize s uppos ed to be.
 
 
One day we hear d our mom fainted. It turned out that s he press ed her  sc r ew too hard to the 
filing
 
stone and the stone 
explod
ed. She got s o s car ed that s he fainted. Then they took  her to 
head
quar ters  and explained to her that you c an't pr es s  the s c rew s o hard to the filing stone bec ause it's 
very hard to get a new one. To or der  one takes  tim e and until
 
then the cr ates  with the other  s c rews  will 
s tand in the door way and c an't be s ent out to the airplane. So s he got an idea that m aybe s he c an be 

helpful a little bit and do this  s ever al tim es, that the c r ate s houldn't get to the air planes . She c alled 
[Indi
s c ernible]. She kept on doing it. The s tone exploded. She fainted. And we wait
ed 
for weeks to get a 
new s tone in and get the c rates  out.
 
 
My s is ter and I didn't know about this . We found out only after the liber ation. Nobody knew 
s he was  ver y s c ared that it would be dis c overed. 
 
 
The work  ther e was  ver y , ver y har d bec aus e it was  at night.We worked from  7:00
 
in the 
evening until 7:00
 
in the m or ning. It was im poss ible to stay
 
alive
 
--
 
well, awake. The m ono
phone 
hum ming, mac hines , 2:00, 4:00
 
in the m or ning. E
verybody was  almos t falling as leep already. It was  
very hard to do this  wor k  for  s o long, for  s o many nights.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So finally, in Februar y
 
1945, you were s ent out of the fac tory of Calw on a forced 
m ar c h. Tell us about that and what you thought was  going to happen to you. 
 

7 
 
> > Agi Geva:  Actually, we wer e told one day just to stand at the door and be r eady to leave.We 
thought it was  meant, to be ready to leave, waiting for  tr ans por tation to the wagons  and traveling 
s om ewhere.We were not that
 
s c ared anymore bec aus e we knew that the allies  wer e already near ing. 
We k new s omehow.We wer e not s uppos ed to know anything. We wer e not s uppos ed to be s hown. 

That's why we worked at night. They didn't want the villager s  and the town people to know that t
here 
ar e pr is oner s, J ews , in that fac tory. The Germ ans  wer e s uc c es sful. Nobody ever  s aw us . 
 
 
And when we went to the door to wait for trans por tation, it was  night, of cours e. It was  dark  
outs ide. They didn't mention we were s uppos ed to walk. They told us  
ther e is  no tr ansportation, just 
s tart walking.
 
It was  im pos s ible to im agine that in this  c old Germ an winter
 
--
 
you know, we had one 
piec e of c lothes, one s hoe, it was n't a s hoe anym or e even, without underwear , without gloves , without 
s c ar ves , without anyt hing, jus t walk. But we had to. And it was  m os tly at night. And until the m ornings 

they looked for  a bar n for us  to s leep in. They told us  to look for food in the bar n. So what did we find?  
Raw potatoes , r aw c abbage. I c an't tell you how hungr y we wer e and how weak we wer e and how 
des perate we wer e.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So you wer e walking, m ore or  less, towar ds  a tr ain station where the guards are 

s uppos ed to be r e
-
arm ed with guns. And when y ou got to the station, what happened? 
 
>> 
Agi Geva
:  Fir st of all, we wer e walking 400
 
kilom eter s . We were s uppos ed to arr ive to Mauthaus en 
but we didn't m ake anymor e. We wer e told to walk  quicker bec aus e if we wanted to c ontinue by train, 

we have to c atc h a tr ain and we s hould be able to get ther e on time. If we couldn't, of c our s e, nobody 
c ould walk anymore, nobody was  s tr ong enough to walk quickly if happy to walk at all. Mos t of us 
c ouldn't walk  anym or e even, inc luding I. 
 
 
We didn't know how luc k y we wer e als o her e
; t
hat on other Death Marc hes  when s o
m eone 
c ouldn't walk , they s im ply s at down at the s ide of the road and they wer e shot and left there. And at 

leas t our guys  didn't do that. They helped us  to walk.
 
 
Ac tually, we found out that thes e tr ains that we were s uppos ed to reac h, they were br inging 
am m unition and guns to exec ute us . Now, s om e of us believed this .We didn't know what to believe 
anym or e but we had s o little str ength. I per s onally  didn't c are. Exec ution, no exec ution, I c an't walk 
anym or e. I just couldn't. And just the despair , the hung
er, the c old. It was  so c old and windy. It was  s o 
hopeles s , everything.
 
 
Somehow we got to the railway s tation. And the train was  not ther e anymore. They wer e 
gone. So our guar d told us
 
--
 
the guards  were four  German s oldier s  and two offic ers , one of them 
a 
woman. They told us jus t go back  to the for est and keep walking. That was  r eally the wors t of the worst 

in m y whole life. I c ould har dly get to the r ailway s tation. And then to be told that you won't go on the 

tr ains  and you won't
 
--
 
I wouldn't s ay they told us we wouldn't be exec uted but we're not s uppos ed to 
know it and jus t overheard the Ger man guar d. But it c ame out to be true.
 
 
I jus t didn't know how I got back  to the for est and all of this hopeles s nes s and c old, to go 
through it again. And then s uddenly we looked around and there were no guards  ar ound us. It was  

unbelievable. We started to whis per  of what c an be, what c an be the r eas on, until one of the kapos  told 

us  that fr om this  day, 28th of Apr il
 
1945, we ar e free. Until we hear d this word, it bec ame the bes t of the 
bes t day of m y life. I really thought I would not be fr ee anym ore, ever . 
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So what happened then?  I think there were 180 Hungar ians , 179 Hungar ians.
 
> > Agi Geva:  Ther e wer e 180 Hungar ians, 20 Polis h people, and 180
 
Hungar ians . Then we found out 
that we are fr ee. Ther e were 180 opinions .
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Agi Geva:  Telling wher e we were and what we s hould do. Everybody had a differ ent idea. Of 

c our se we wer e ver y happy but s till c old, still weak , still hungr y. My mother s om ehow found s om e 35 
women of the s am e opinion to go out to the s ame direc tion that we s tarted out. We were s till s c ared but 
we wer e afraid to fall into Germ an hands again or who will be our  liberators or who will be the s oldiers  
we ar e going to find
 
on the way. 
 
 
And then luc kily we hear d English s peaking, an Englis h
-
s peaking gr oup. We found out they 
were Am er ic ans . And thes e wer e the first Am er icans  I ever s aw.When they s aw us, they thought never 

8 
 
in their  life, they s aw a bunc h
 
of w
om en s o ugly, s o dirty, s o bad, s o weak . They jus t took  us t
o t
heir  
headquar ters  and r eally looked after us. They wer e ver y nic e. 
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  So from there your  m other dec ided that you should go back to Mis kolc . What was  
it like
 t
o go back
? 
> > Agi Geva:  My mother
 
dec ided to go back, actually, bec aus e s he wanted to know who r em ained 
alive fr om  the fam ily. The united r es titution offic es  where the Am eric ans  sent us from the headquarters , 

we s tayed eight m onths . It took  my m om eight months  to dec ide what to do. We wan
ted s o muc h to go 
to Pales tine, to the states  m aybe, anywher e els e but back  to Mis kolc . She ins is ted.
 
 
So when we went bac k , our hotel was  c om pletely empty
, a
lmost. So s he couldn't open it and 
s tart anew. That's what she wanted to do. After s he found out who was  aliv e fr om the family. She got 
s om e help. They went to the neighbors. She found every c ur tain. She s aid this  is m ine, this  bed is 

m ine, this  c ar pet is  m ine. They helped her to r efurnis h the hotel and s tar t it all over again.
 
 
But when I went to sc hool the next tim e I c ould, one of the schoolm
ates asked me, 
W
hy did 
you c ome back?  And the other  one asked, 
W
e never thought to s ee you again. So the anti
-
Semitism 
was  even wors e than it was  befor e. So how c ould I go and s it in the s c hool room and s tudy?  
I went to 
the princ ipal. I told him, no way
; j
us t let me m ake the tests  twic e a year and I'll s tudy at hom e. That's 
how I'm going to finis h my s tudies .
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  And fr om ther e you went to Is r ael.
 
> > Agi Geva:  We c ould s ign up as s oldier  for Pal
es tine to fight for Israel bec aus e I was  pas s ed 18 
alr eady. I did s o. And my mother was  des per ate. She thought, I s aved you and I wanted us to stay 
together and now you want to go and leave me her e?  But m y s is ter  and I, we had to.We jus t c ouldn't 
stay th
er e. They didn't let out older  people. They let out only us , the younger  ones
 w
ith the hope that 
the par ents would be able to c om e
 
--
 
they would let them c om e after us. And we had to take this r isk . 
My m om  c ouldn't understand how we c ould do this  to her.
 

 
As  bad as a felt that tim e, it was s o wonderful later . Six year s  later they let her c om e. And 
ever y s ingle day s he told us  thank  you that we did this  that we left and we c ould br ing her  to Is rael.
 
My mom remarrie

old s on in Ausc hwitz. They met and rem arr ied and 
c am e to Isr ael, to a Kibbutz until m y s is ter is now. She lived to 97
 
1/2. Now nobody, not one of them, 
would be alive today if my m om wouldn't have s aved us . Today, of cours e, we ar e mor e but that was  

the thought all t

> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  I don't know what happened to it.

> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  I have it if you want to c ome s ee it but it
 
dis appeared from  the s lide s how. 
 
> > Agi Geva:  And if you have ques tions, I will be very glad to ans wer  of the deportation, what 
happened befor e or  after.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  Ok . So tr y to m ake your  questions  as brief as  pos s ible. I believe we have peopl

with m ic rophones  c om ing down. So if you want to r ais e your hand.
 
 
I think  there's a gentlem an in the back  there waving his  hand.
 
> > Agi Geva:  You might have to r epeat.
 
> > You m entioned earlier a per s on c alled a k apos. Could you trans late that, what is  a
 
k apos ?
 
> > Agi Geva:  Yes. There were am ong Polis h pr is oner s  c hos en kapos . Kapos  m eant C
ommandant, 
ac tually, or  [inaudible] 
meant that they wer e r es pons ible for the s am e barrac k s . There were 250 people 
in the barr ack s  and s omebody had to be r es ponsible. They would als o, Polis h pris oners , bec aus e they 
s poke fluently German. They were alr eady four, five year s  in the c amps  when we arr ived, the 
Hungar ian group. They called kapos and [Indis c ernible]. It just means that they were res pons ible. 
People's  elder s, not
 
neces s ar ily in age. 
 
 
Does  this  ans wer  your  ques tion?

> > Yes, thank  you.
 
> > Ales ia Fis hm an:  Anybody els e? 
 
> > Yes, ma'am. I wanted to know, do you hold any bitter nes s or hatred towar ds  the German people? 
 
> > Agi Geva:  German people m eaning Germ an people
. Maybe thir d, almos t four gener ations  s ince 

then s o whom am I s uppos ed to hate, ac tually?  Thes e ar e not the s am e people who did all ther e have 
to us.
 
 
Is  that what you m eant? 
 
 
My s is ter, for ins tanc e, she does n't s peak Germ an. She s poke Ger man. She wouldn't s peak  
Germ an for anything. She just c an't bring hers elf

or to buy anything that's  Germ an
-
m ade. Many 
people c ame to this c onclus ion. They wouldn't buy a Germ an. They wouldn't s peak the language. I do 

like to s peak the German language and I look  at it in a different way.

bec aus e I s pok e Germ an and Hungarian but 
nobody

and Englis h. Nobody in Is r ael wanted to hear anyone talk English or 
German
. Hungar ian 
nobody unders tood. So I had a pr oblem. So s omehow it s tuck  there until I c ouldn't go on. Until I lear ned 

Hebrew, I was  alr eady marr ied and had c hildren and went in a different direc tion.

Never  think  back  anym ore.We have been thr ough hell. We are free. We don't talk about it anymor e. 
We don't think  about it anymore. And for  a while I believed m aybe that's  r ight but then I thought it's not. 
 
 
With them I c ouldn't dis cus s it anym or e. But then I thought that s om ebody has  to talk  about it. 
And when I heard that ther e are people who don't even believe that it happened, and are doubtful and

> > Agi Geva:  I thank you for  being s uch good lis teners . Really, you give me s o m uc h s ympathy and 
c our age that I s hould be able to talk and able to tell the stor y without a s ingle distur banc e. So really 
thank
 
you.
 
 
I have to tell you that it's not exac tly how it happened. It was  s o m uc h wors e. There was  s o 
m uc h c ruelty and atr oc ities  ar ound me. If I would tell you exac tly how it happened and would mention 

all of thos e horr ible things , I wouldn't be able to k eep on talking about it. So just that you s hould know it 
was n't exac tly that way.
