Q: What were your parents™ name s? 
A: There was 
David
, my father. My mother™s name was
 Paula
; her maiden name 
Kleefelt
, 
k-l-e-e-f-e-l-t
. 
Q: What kind of wo rk 
did your father do? 
A: Well, my father was Œ ha-had in 
Europe
 a plumbing su pply business, which at 
one time arranged over parts of 
F-France
, 
Switzerland
 and 
Germany
. My mother 
helped him, work ed with him in
 the business, or was at home. 
Q: D-Do  you, or di

A: I have one sister, 
Margot
. 
Q: Is she older or younger? 
A: She is five years older.  
Q: So, would you describe yo
ur family as upper class? 
I mean, your father sounded 
like a suc-successful businessman. 

A: I guess everybody more or less describe
s themselves as middle class, and I™ll go 
along with the same thing. Yeah , I would 
say solid middle class. Both my  parents 
came from rural town Œ 
from a rural town, and Œ but then, 
as I say, had this business, 

which was first loca Œ was initially located in 
Freiburg
, in Œ wh ere I was born.  
Q: Did you live right in th
e city, or on the outskirts? 
A: We lived on the edge of the city, let™s 
put it this way, in a re Œ in a residential 
area.

Q: Was this in an apartment, or a house? 
A: It was an apartment, it wa
s an apartment in a Œ one of 
the typical houses, cou Œ la-
large houses, in which there were, 
I think, two or three apartments. 
Q: Was the neighborhood a mixed neighbo
rhood, made up of Je
ws and non-Jews? 
A: I really don™t know, it certainly was not 
a Jewish neighborhood. Since I left there 
by th e time I was about six or seven, I really don™t know very mu ch about the 

religious make-up of th e area, but I would 
say it was Œ it was a Œ a typical urban area, 
and certainly not a Jewish area. 

Q: So you say you moved from that location 
at the age of six, so that would have 
been in 1931. Do  you have any memo ries up to
 the age of six of the friends there, or 
anything that happened at that Œ 
you know, up to the age of six. 
A: Let me amend that, actually was 1933, 
so by th at time I was eight years old.  
Q: Did Œ and so you started school in that location? 

A: I did start school in that location, went
 to  primary school there, yes. I reme mber 
quite well, I Œ I do remember c-certain bits
 and pieces. I can vi-vividly recall the 
area, of course especially so
 since I™ve visited it since then again. It was Œ it was a 
good life. We Œ we had househ old help, and as
 I say, my parents Œ 
my  dad used to be 
traveling quite a bit as a Œ selling for hisbusiness, but my  mo ther was home all the 
time. 

Q: How religious was your family? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

A: I would say nominally so, for the 
holidays, and went to the synagogue 
occasionally, or on Saturdays, regular Satu
rday services. So I would say sort of Œ 
well, how would y
ou describe it? 
Q: So did you observe the Sabb
ath, did you observe Passover? 
A: Oh yes, all the holid
ays were observed, yes. 
Q: Did you have any Hebrew 
school training befo re the Œ up to the age of eight? 
A: No, I don™t Œ not Œ not that I recall, no, I didn™t. 
Q: Was there a large extended family, eith
er or your mother or father™s side? 
A: Well, there was a fairly sizeab le family
, not in a town wher
e we lived, but where 
my  parents had co me from, and that Œ 
since that was only about 20 miles away. 

There was, by today™s standards, a very cl
ose, nearby ex tended fami ly. Of course, in 
those days 20 miles was a fairly substantial distance. 
Q: So did you get togeth
er with them at specia
l holiday s and so fo rth? 
A: Oh yes, we often did. A
nd in addition to that actually, one of my uncles, at times 
worked with my fath
er in his busin ess. 
Q: Was your father very politically oriented, or your mother at that Œ at that time? 

A: No, neither one, I would say, was either 
p Œ was really politically
 oriented or Œ or 
active. 

Q: And were Œ were yo
ur parents Zionists? 
A: No, they were not.

Q: What language di
d you speak at home? 
A: We spoke German. 
Q: So from 1925 to 1933, 
you were in this location. Is there anything else you 
wanted to  say about that time, before 
we mo ve on? Wh -W h-When  you were in 

school, up to  the age of ei
ght, did you have a
ny unpleasant experien ces, or any 
unpleasant experiences in the 
street with other children? 
A: Ye Œ well, some, not very much. I mean, 
we™re Œ we Œ since we left in April of 
1933, this was very shortly after 
Hitler™s
 actual rise to power, 
there wasn™t really all 
that much. Yes, there were the Œ there wa
s the occasional bully, 
but actually I ran 
into that later on,
 much more so. 
Q: Okay , well, let™s now move into  1933, and in January 
Hitler
 came into power as 
chancellor. And so, how did that affect your family? 

A: Well, on April 1, 1933, there was a boycott of Jewish busin ess in 
Germany
, 
which was actually one of the Œ the first cen
trally orchestrated anti-Jewish outbreak 
or outburst of activity. And we
 packed up and went off to 
Switzerland
, where by 
that time a ma Œ a major branch 
of the business was located in 
Ba sel
. So in 1933, we 
went Œ went off to 
Basel
,
 Switzerland
.  
Q: So from 1933 on, you were in 
Basel
, or did you return? 
A: Well, it was Œ it wasn™t all that
 cut and dried. We stayed in 
Ba sel
 for a while. As 
best as I recall, we did not get 
permission to stay permanently in  
Ba sel
. I remember

we lived in a hotel for quite 
a wh ile. And th en we moved to 
France
, across the 
border into 
France
, into 
Saint-Louis
. Again 
[indecipherable]
 across the border 
from 
Basel
. 
Q: Okay, we™ll get to that in a minute. Wh
en you had to move, wh at did your parents 
say to you, why did you have to move? Here
™s an eight year old child, how did they 
phrase it to you? 
A: I really can™t recall. I really don™t kn
ow. But to my Œ well, it was an interesting 
adventure. I wasn™t that wild in Œ bein
g in school, and I was being pulled out of 

school, and off we went to 
Ba sel
. So I really Œ I must admit, I do not know. I do not 
recall.  
Q: Did th is man 
Hitler
 mean anything to you at age eight? 
A: Oh, I™m sure Œ I™m sure he
 did, but exactly what he meant to me at that point, I 
mean, I™m sure it was not Œ I wa Œ I mu Œ 
I must have picked it up from Œ I mean, I 
wa Œ I was receptive enough, I think, to 
pick these things up 
from my surroundings, 
but if you asked me what I thought of th
em exactly, and Œ and what way it came to 
me, I don™t know. 
Q: How would you desc
ribe yourself as a child? Were
 you very  independent, or Œ 
A: That depends wh om you ask. No, I don™t th
ink I was really all that independent. I 
had a Œ well, I Œ I liked being by my self. I 
was probably rather introspective, and like 
at that point already, and this came out 
much later, we liked reading a great deal, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997

liked playing with construction 
toys. In other words, activ
ities that are usually singul 
Œ done by one person. I can™t recall ever havi
ng though, certainly 
at that time having 
a Œ a circle of friends. I mean, I knew pe
ople, but nose Œ no big 
circle of friends. 
Q: So you packed  yo
ur bags to go to 
Switzerland
 with your family. What is Œ what 
di Œ is your sister™s name? 
A: 
Margot
. 
Q: Oh, 
Margot
. So you and 
Ma rgot 
and your parents. Any ex
tended family, or just 
the four of you? 

A: No, just the f Œ no, just the four of us. 

Q: And you don™t reme mb er this being pa
rticularly upsetting, having to leave 
friends? 

A: No. As I say, I don™t think I had a very la
rg e, or a circle of friends at that point. 
Q: And 
Freiburg
 is Œ is not that far from the 
Swiss border. So what about the 
journey there, do you rememb er anything 
about that? And then where did you first 
settle? 

A: Well, we settled for a while in the hotel in 
Basel
. And after that when Œ 
apparently  my  parents did not
 get permission to stay in 
Ba sel
, or they Œ or thought it 
appropriate otherwise. I mu st admit I neve
r did find, never did ask. We moved across 
the border to 
Saint-Louis
, which is in 
France
, and lived th ere. And I went to school 
in 
Saint-Louis
, both my  sister and I did,
 in a local school there.

Q: What was that like for you? Did you 
have any idea of the language in the 
beginning? 
A: None whatsoever. Well, you know you, a-at
 that age if you ge
t thrown into this 
sort of environment Œ th e people there obviously do speak German or a Swiss 

dialect, or a Swiss type of dialect, 
or wh atever you want to call the 
Alsace 
Œ the 
Alsatian manner of speaking. And so Œ 
but French obviously was Œ was Œ was 
difficult, and we had a Œ we spen t a limited amount of time in 
Switzerland Œ 
in 
France
. 
Q: How long were you in 
France
? 

A: To the best of my recollection, un Œ 
until late Œ sometime middle, late 1934. In 
other wo rds, about Œ I would say about a year. 

Q: Any Œ any unpleas
ant experiences there where you
 would Œ did they know you 
were Jewish? 

A: No unpleasant experiences 
to the extent that I know no
w Œ that I can recall, no. 
Q: And were you very  close to your pare
nts, did you have a 
very good relationship 
with them, or were th
ey  open with you about what was happening? 
A: Well Œ 
Q: Or did you not question? 
A: 
A
, I probably  didn™t question it too mu ch. 
B
, I guess at that time already, my 
parents were under a great deal of strain, 
certainly a lot more th
an I was. And while 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

one develops a certain type of closeness as 
a result, it™s Œ it™s not 
quite the same as a 
Œ as a closeness which develops in
 Œ in tranc Œ peace and tranquility.  
Q: Were you able to voice your fears to your parents? 
A: I don™t recall that I had any fears. I susp
ect that my  parents probably were anxious 
to Œ limited my fears to th
e max i mu m p o ssib l e, so  Œ 
Q: Did you talk things 
over with  your sister? 
A: No, we were a little bit Œ we were apar
t Œ five years apart. I would say that 
communication is prob Œ was probably mo re Œ 
even more difficult 
tha-than with my 
parents, because the Œ the Œ the five year 
age difference between the youngsters is Œ 
is pretty substantial. 

Q: So, after the year was 
over, then wh ere did you go? 
A: Well, in 1934, I believe it was, the Fr
ench, having received a large number of 
refugees Œ at this point we ha
d larg ely given up our business in 
Freiburg
 in  
Germany
, and still had the business in 
Switzerland
 and in 
France
. At that point I 
believe it was that the French authorities basi
cally said to the refugees in Œ many had 
settled along the bord er here, that it was n
ecessary for them to go inland a certain 
distance, or to leave. In other wo rds, residence along th e border was not Œ was 

frown ed upon, or in fact, forbidden. And so
 my  parents really had a choice to make; 
do th ey want to go inland? And is Œ if I 
remember correctly, I th
ink the closest they 
could go to would be th
e city Œ the town of 
Merceuil
 or, do they  want to leave Œ and, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

which would of course made pretty well 
impossible the business Œ maintaining the 
busin ess in 
Switzerland
, and while he Œ to a cert
ain extent, the business in 
France
, 
which was also very 
close to the border. 
Q: So your father was still ac
tively working at this point? 
A: Oh yes, we Œ we still had our business.
 And so we packed 
up and moved back to 
Germany
. And we did not move back to 
Freiburg
, we moved to  a town  called 
Loerrach
, 
l-o-e Œ 
double
 r-a-c-h
. 
Q: Is that near 
Freiburg
? 
A: That is Œ well, everything 
is n Œ well, a-again, it™s one 
of those things that today 
it™s very close, in the old days it was qu
ite far. It™s only abou
t two miles from the 
Swiss border. It was about three 
miles as the crow flies from 
Saint-Louis
. In other 
words, they were all 
[indecipherable]
 or not, at the point where the Œ the 
Rhine
 
River makes its bend, where the free countries
 meet. It was about, oh I would say, 40 
- 50 miles from 
Freiburg
. So we Œ we got back there fa
irly frequently, but it Œ it still 
Œ in those days it was a fairly long distance. 

Q: Was it hard going over 
the borders at this time? 
A: No, it was quite easy. A-Again, for a tim
e we lived in a guesthouse, a Œ a local 
hotel near the swi Œ again, very close to 
the Sw iss border. I would say Œ as I say, 
about the mile. And then even
tually moved into an apartm
ent in the center of town.

And that mu st have been e
ither 1934 or early 1935. By  
that time my  sister did not 
come back, or came back and then
 she was se nt to a school in 
France
, a Œ what is it? 
Q: Boarding school? 
A: Boarding school in 
France
, and she went there. A place called 
Remy 
Achmont
(ph). And I started going to school in 
Loerrach
.  
Q: And things started to tighten  up, and 
Hitler
 was gaining mo re and mo re power. 
Did you have a sense of
 this tightening up? 
A: Yes, at that point things obviously st
arted tightening up i-in Œ in many different 
ways. The business was still going, the Germ an business was still 
going, although by 
that time I Œ I think the Œ the main part Œ 
we-well, the Œ or no, I™m sorry. There was 
no mo re business in 
Germany
, the business was largely in 
Switzerland
, and 
probably to a much lesser extent in 
France
. But we lived. It was a nice, large 
apartment in a big ap artment house. 
Q: Was your father able 
to go back and forth to 
Switzerland
 and 
France 
at that 
time? 

A: Yes. To Œ wh ether or not
 he went Œ yes, I™m quite sure he went back to 
France
 as 
well, but I do know he went to 
Swit zerla n d
. And he would travel in 
Switzerland
. I 
would so metimes go with him,
 and we often went to 
Basel
, it was the ni Œ th e closest 
large city.

Q: Well, now you™re getting older and it™s, 
as you say almo st 1935, so you™re 10 
years old, and you di Œ when
 you would see signs on the 
street, derogatory  signs or 
anything anti-Jewish, how did th at
 strike you as a 10 year old? 
A: Well, you Œ you Œ y
ou Œ you begin to notice things lik
e this, but one of the things, 
I mean, in Œ in that part of 
Germany
, anti-Semitism wasn™t
 probably quite as 
virulent as it was in other parts of 
Germany
. In other words, the Œ in the s Œ in the 
southwest of 
Germany
, I think people were slightly mo
re relaxed, and I think this 
was true for quite a bit of time. A nd Œ but 
yes, there were obviously signs. I knew I 
was Jewish, I went to a German school. I we
nt Œ first finished sec Œ f Œ well, by th at 
time I guess I had Œ I™d finished  secondary sc
hool Œ primary school, I was then in the 
[indecipherable] schule
, secondary school. I had a number of friends, but it was Œ it 
was obviously noticeable. One didn™t coun
t the certain problems. You had the 
normal sort of bully. 
Q: Such  as? Can you describe an incident? 
A: Well, I guess bullies are probably pretty
 well the same all ove
r. No, not Œ nothing 
particular. I do know that after the war I 
went back looking fo r him, but he wasn™t 
there any more.  

Q: Did th ey call you names? 
A: No, not that I recall, not that I recall. 
I was not, you know, a Œ it was, again, I was 
probably rather introspective, I was not very
 good at sports, so even if, you know, if 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
15
you Œ if they chose sports teams or teams 
for games and so on, I was usually one of 
the last picked. However, I do not attribute 
t h at necessarily to my being Jewish. I 
suspect I just wasn™t
 very good at it. 
Q: How did you feel about 
being Jewish at that point
, wh en you know it meant 
difficulties? 
A: It was no Œ there was no resentment or 
anything like that on my  part. I felt I was 

Jewish, and that™s the way things are, and 
I was perfectly Œ perfectly satisfied and no 
Œ no s Œ no special feelings about it. 

Q: Did you have any hobbies? You sa
id you liked to r
ead. Anything else? 
A: Well, actually, at that point, mainly 
I wo uld say I liked construction toys. We Œ 
the family often went out for walks, that
 wasn™t necessarily what I would have 
chosen to do, but that™s what we did. No
, no other great hobbies. I did have a Œ at 
that Œ during this period, I ha Œ wh ich 
actually lasted for a long time, I had a 
neighbor, next door neighbo
r, a Œ a young, a friend, an 
Aryan, German, with whom I 
was friendly until we left eventually 
Germany
, and he joined even tually Œ he Œ I 
think he became a 
Hitler
 Œ  memb er o f  th e 
Hitler 
Youth. But you know, that was just 
one of those things that one
 had to do, or did, and Œ 
Q: So you felt comfortable in his house Œ 

A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: Œ did you go play  with him? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
16
A: Oh yes, oh yeah, he felt 
comfortable in our house and I felt comfortable in his. I 
had some Jewish friends. 
Q: Was the school a mixed school? This 
was Jewish and non-Jewish children? 
A: Well, yeah, it was Œ it was the local Œ 

Q: 
[indecipherable]
 public? 
A: It was the local public school, and th ere 
was not a very large Jewish presence in 
that town, yes. So it was Œ it was Œ I me
an, I Œ I don™t know how many Œ I suspect 
you had less than one percent or 
tw o percent Jews in the school. 
Q: And the tea Œ the t
eachers treated you well? 
A: Some Œ I would say yes, I had a couple 
of teachers who were
, I felt probably went 
out of their way to be nice. That actua
lly came, I guess a bit later, but I had one 

teacher who, if you wanted to, I mean 
Œ I don™t know what 
Œ you know, I Œ I Œ 
maybe I™m Œ I™m in a minority. I Œ you ca
n find anti-Semitism anyplace if you look 
for it hard enough. That assumes that not
hing bad ever happens to anybody who™s 
not Jewish. In other words, you know, a 
teacher can be mean, or Œ or you can 
attribute to anti-Semitism. On the other hand , they™re mean to other kids as well. So, 

to answer your questions, it wasn™t terribly ba
d, in th Œ I had some teachers, a couple 
of teachers that I would have preferred not to have. On th
e other hand, I had a couple 
that in retrospect, I think went
 out of their way to be nice. 

Q: Was there a picture of 
Hitler 
in your classrooms? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
17
A: Oh, there must have been. I™m sure th ere was. Can™t recall, but I™m quite sure. 
Q: Did you have to salute him, or say 
heil Hitler
? 
A: No, no, we di Œ we didn™t. 
Q: So when you would look at a picture of 
Hitler
, any specific reaction on your part? 
A: Gee. Well, I don™t know. It™s kind of di
fficult to Œ to Œ wh a-what one felt like at 
that point. Obviously I knew my  Œ my  folks 
were having increasing problems. This 
became very obvious, a lot mo
re obvious as my mother became mo re and more 
tense. My father was perhaps somewhat more relaxed, but my mother certainly 
became increasingly tense.
 So one picks it up, it™s not very difficult. 
Q: How did it manifest itself with her? 
A: Well, a nervousness, a sort of a Œ she,
 I think, developed stomach ulcers, had 
other problems. But for instance for Œ I re
member for stomach ulcers she went to 

Switzerland
 to get treated. So it was still quite
 possible to go b
ack and forth.  
Q: And now it™s, let™s say 1
936, and you™re just leading 
your life as it is. Did you 
hear about the Olympics then? 

A: Oh heavens yes, that was Œ I may not ha
ve been very  good at sports, but I™m a 
great spectator or listener, yes. 
Q: What were your impressions? 
A: Well, I Œ I sort of had, I remember I 
sort of had mixed fee
lings. On one hand, I 
was still interested in the German athletes. 
O n  the other hand, you
 liked to see them

occasionally get beaten. I Œ I didn™t Œ I look
ed at it purely or primarily as a sports 
event, not as a political  event at that point. 
Q: Did you sent Œ sense any anti-Jewi
shness among, you know, permission of 
athletes to compete. 

A: No, at that time I Œ since I knew nobo
dy Œ what I found ou
t in the meantime, 
learned in the meantime is one thing, but 
at that point I did not know. I mean, no. 
Q: What is it like for a 10 year old boy to 
see people on the streets i n  uniform? Did 
you admire them, were you frightened of them? 

A: Well, no, and obviously didn™t admire 
them. But one had a healthy respect for Œ 

you can call it fear, or whatever it is, yes.
 And of course, starting about 1936, then 
things started getting tougher. As I say again,
 until 1936, it wasn™t al
l that bad in that 
part of the world. 

Q: In wh at way did 
things get tougher? 
A: Well, then of course things started with ™37 - ™38. 
Q: What were some of the rest
rictions that you
 lived under? 
A: None that I can recall, that 
we hadparticular restrictions. 
Q: Did you have any cu rfews, or were yo
u restricted to going to any places? 
A: No, but I suspect they wa
s somewhere my parents felt th
ey weren™t Œ they weren™t 
welcome, and we wouldn™t go there. I cert
ainly didn™t know of any place. I me an, I Œ

I Œ I was aware of course, then came the 
Nuremberg 
laws about then. I was aware of 
those. 
Q: How did that strike you? 
A: Pretty weird. You Œ you 
Œ you begin Œ I wouldn™t say one
 begins to accept it, but 
one lives with it, and it™s amazing one does. 
Q: Did you think 
Hitler
 would eventually just go away? 
A: I don™t think I had any par
ticular feelings about that. I mean, I w ould Œ I susp ect, 
as I know a lot of people did, as perhaps my  
parents or my  father did, and Œ but even 
that he Œ no, I can™t recall him expressing th
at, but I would Œ I wouldn™t have been Œ 
would Œ wouldn™t be su
rprised if he had. 
Q: Jews were then classified as second 
class citizens. Did you feel second class? 
A: No, no, I didn™t. I was livi
ng in a slightly different world, let™s put it this way. A 
world that was not in the mainstream, but 
it was still at that poi
nt, normal enough to 
feel that, you know, one Œ one Œ one just 
lived in a Œ in another group, which 
obviously was being Œ was disa
dvantaged to a certain exte
nt, or being Œ being Œ oh, 
how should one say? Consid ered not qu
ite on the same level, but I tha Œ 
Q: But you didn™t feel
 yourself inferior? 

A: No, I definitely did not. 
Q: Any particularly frighten ing 
experiences in ™36 and ™37? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
20
A: No, not that I can recall. Things 
did happen in ™38 wh
ich were obviously  
frightening, but ™36 - ™37, not really, no. 
Q: Okay , now co mes 1938, and it™s the 
anschluss
. Do you have any mem Œ 
A: Well Œ 

Q: Œ recollection of that, 
or anything preceding that? 
A: Actually, preceding that, I guess I should 
say, I was sufficiently aware when  the 
Rhineland
 was being Œ being occupied , that my  
antenna sort of perked up, an d at 
that point began to realize that there were 
certain problems in th
e air. In 1938 of 
course Œ 

Q: Before we go a little furt
her into 1938, I Œ I just rea
lized that your Bar Mitzvah 
would have come in February  ™3
8. Did you have a Bar Mitzvah? 
A: Yes, I Œ yes, yes, I did. I had a Bar Mitzvah. 

Q: Please talk about it. 

A: Well, it was a Bar Mitzvah, it was in Œ in 
Loerrach
. I remember I got a bicycle. 
Now this was obviously not the most important 
thing, but it™s one of the things I still 
reme mb er. Yes, and the other day actually, 
somebody showed  me a picture of me at 
my  bar Œ taken at my  Bar Mitzvah. So  yes, 
it was the relatives, to 
the extent that they 
had not yet left. Now, in the meantime I shoul
d say this: in 1936 or ™37, my  sister Œ I 
guess 1936, my sister left from Œ came back
 from her boarding school, and then went 
off to the 
United Sta tes
. My parents sent her to the 
U.S.
, and she Œ 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
21
Q: Ho-H ow did they get the Œ 
th-the papers to do that? 
A: Well, we had relatives Œ by that time 
we had certain relatives th at had in the 
meantime, left 
Germany
. And we had relatives who lived  here long time, and she 
got her affidavit that way.
 And so she came to  the 
United States
, I believe it was 
1936. We had some other relatives, an uncle who left there. I think they probably left 

in 1937. My mother™s
 stepmo ther Œ in other word s, my  grandmother, she left and 
joined tw o of her Œ one of he
r daughters. So the family at that point was leaving. In  
fact, the only ones that were le
 Œ staying behind was our family. 
Q: Did your parents say why th ey weren™t 
trying to  leave? Or were they trying to  
leave? 

A: Well, they were trying to leave. I thi
nk one of the key problems, of course, was 
having a business. The Germans were very
 reluctant. They were Œ they were 
perfectly willing to let them
 go, provided that they we
re sure that all foreign 
exchange had been repatriated to 
Germany
, and ex changed into  good German 
marks. And to convince them of that, of 
course took a long time. So I would say my  
parents probably  applied for a Œ fo r emigration to  the 
United Sta tes 
probably in  Œ I 

would Œ my  guess would be 1937 
or early ™38. On e of the problems, of course at that 
point is my  father had been in th e Germ
an army, had been wo
unded in the army, 
earned str Œ in fact, he had been wo unded 
three times, h e had earned the Iron Cross, 
etcetera, etcetera. And as the Germans were 
wont to say, the thank of the Fatherland, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
22
you can be assured of the thanks of yo
ur Fatherland. An d a great ma ny actually, I 
think, World War II Œ World 
War I killed a lot of people, and that World War II 
people, who felt that they were safe, b
ecause of the big to-do that the Germans 
always made about their World War I soldiers
. In fact, the other day I ran across, in 
going th rough so me of my  father™s things, a 
certificate. In 1936 he received a special 
medal, which apparently at that point was be
ing given to all former
 front line soldiers 
in World War I. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuati
on of the interview with 
Gerald  Schwab
. And you were 
talking about your father™s experience in World War I. 
A: So, in World War Œ as I say, perhaps 
among former German 
frontline soldiers, the 
urgency, the feeling that they had to get out of 
Germany
 was not quite as great as it 
was among the general po Œ Jewish populatio
n. Bu t anyhow, by th at time, of course, 
then in 1938, a great many things happ
ened. By that time 
the Œ I think it was 
probably in 1938 that the Fr
ench Œ the Swiss started restr i cting access to Jews. This 
is when passports were stamped with a big 
J
, although that may ha
ve been in 1939. I 
do know that my father star
ted encountering problems of
 driving Œ of going into  
Switzerland
. About that time, and again I can™t 
recall exactly whether it was before

the events of November 1938, or after, Jews
, the Œ the use of cars was restricted. In 
other words, things started ge
tting pretty rough. In 19 no Œ 
Q: Can we back up a little bit. I ju st was 
asking about your Bar Mitzvah. Were there 
any problems, did you feel any restrictions 
there, or were you able to celebrate it? 
A: No, no restrictions, we celebrated it. It
 was not a big festivity, but it was Œ there 
was Œ I me an, one Œ one didn™t Œ you certainl
y didn™t do anything ostentatious at that 
point. But as I recall, it re Œ it was 
celebrated and it was Œ we had a Œ 
Q: So you felt comfortable going to  the syna
gogue and participating in the service? 
A: Oh yes. No, no 
question about that. 
Q: All right, now Œ then  
Hitler
 marched into 
Austria
. Do  you have any recollection 
of that? 
A: No Œ well, I have a reco
llection of it happening, and Œ 
Q: What was your parents™ response to that? 

A: I™m not sure we talked about it. I™m not 
sure we did. Keep in mind ag ain, parents 
at that point were somewhat wary as to wh
at they said to thei
r kids. They really 
didn™t know Œ I mean, you were always Œ at 
that point, it had gotten 
to Œ by ™37 - ™38, 
it had gotten to the point wh ere one watched 
very carefully what one said, and had to 
watch carefully what one said
. Things change really substantially after around ™36 - 

™37. And therefore Œ well, pa
rents obviously alerted their 
children, as my  parents did 
me, what I should 
or should not do. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
24
Q: Such as? 
A: Well, I mean, just watching what yo
u do, where you go and what you say.  
Q: When  you say watching
 wh ere you go, such  as? 
A: Well, you Œ you Œ 
you Œ you obviously  did not go 
to large demonstrations or 
marches through town an-and
 Œ and things like that. 
Q: Were there many of those? 

A: No, not too many. No, not 
too many. Except the regional 
Hitler
 Youth 
headquarters was about a half a block from our house, and I reme mb er 
Baldur von 
Schirach
, who at that point was the head of the 
Hitler
 Youth. Yes, I remember 
seeing him from a distance. The ne
xt time I saw him was 1946 in  
Nuremberg
. 
Q: Was it frightening to  see uniforms on the 
Hitler
 Youth? 
A: Yes, at this time you became mo re wa
ry, you Œ you did. 
I mean, you started 

associating it obviously with Œ with certai
n events, things that took place, fears. 
Whether you yourself experienced them, or 
others did. At that point you started 
seeing ﬁ
Der
 
Stürmer
,ﬂ 
Streicher™s
 newspapers on display 
all over town  Œ various 
parts of town. And so yes, at that point
 things started getting Œ getting a lot Œ lot 

tougher. 
Q: Did you see any physical
 incidents on the street? 
A: No, except, as I say , my one personal bu
lly. But even that was limited. But yes, I 
would Œ I can™t really recall 
any physical problem. I do know that fairly frequently I

would take different routes home, to get ho
me, get out of his way and so on. I cannot 
recall they were being attacked, and I™m su
re I would rememb er that. So Œ but you 
know, the-there was a definite fear there. 
Q: Did you feel German at that 
point, or just Jewish, or both? 
A: Well, I felt both, I would say. Yeah, I 
would say you Œ you Œ 
you feel both. You 
do Œ you Œ keep in mind, we did not have 
that large or active a Jewish population. 
There was no Jewish area in th
e town . The numb er of Jews living in Œ in town, you 
could count on Œ on Œ on a coup
le of fingers. I did have, as I say, I h ad one Jewish 
friend. He and I got together fairly freque
ntly . I would say I Œ actually I had two 
friends, one German, one Œ 
one Aryan and one Jewish. 
Q: But there was a synagogue that wa
s supported by th e Jewish community? 
A: Yes. The synagogue
 
was supported, and 
we would often go to  Saturday morning 
services, certainly every holiday, etcetera. 

Q: What was Passover 1938 like for you? 
Do you have any re
collection of that? 
A: Now you™re asking somethi
ng th at I really don™t Œ 
Q: I was just thinking it 
was such a pivotal time. 
A: Well, it couldn™t have been 
terribly good, because at that point my  sister was in 
New York
, most of my re-relatives had left th
e country. My dad™s ability to earn a 
living had pretty well shrunk to
 probably virtually zero, or
 certainly not mu ch mo re 
than that. So  it could not have been  a jo
yous occasion, let™s put it this way. And I 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

26
guess we said next year in 
Jerusalem
 probably with a
 
little more fervor than we had 
in the past.  
Q: And then the summertime came, what di
d you do in  the summer 
of ™38, anything 
special? 

A: Gee. I don™t recall any particular time. 
I was still going to school, I was still going 

to the German school. As a small 
child, wh en we were living in 
Freiburg
 and 
probably early 
Loerrach
, I used to go to a Œ a Jewi
sh summer camp. But certainly 
not at that point any mo re. So I probably  
got into a certain amount of mischief and 
spent the summer that wa
y with my friends.  
Q: You said you had a Jewish friend at the time. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you and he talk about wh at was ha
ppening? Was that so
mething the children 
talked about, or were you ju st involved in ch ildren™s activities with him? 

A: Well, I™m Œ again, I™m quite sure we we
re talking about it, but it was Œ I don™t Œ I 
w Œ I would say it was one of the subjec
ts, it was certainly not the subject of 
conversation. Bu t he Œ he 
and I got along quite well. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: 
Peter Wyle
(ph). 
Peter 
and I got along quite well, we
 Œ we played together, we 
met after school, etcetera. If I recall correctly
, he went to Œ I can™t recall whether Œ he 
didn™t go to the same school I went, 
I can™t recall where he went. But anyhow. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
27
Q: Were you a Œ a strong ch ild? I know you 
said you weren™t that much into  some 
physical activity, but were yo
u Œ were you small for your 
age, or were you Œ look 
older than  you did? 
A: I was a shrimp. No, I was very small, 
yes. Actually I was Œ any picture you Œ I 
have, it™s hard to believe at this point. I wa
s very small, yes, and very Œ and actually 
the only Œ I only started grow
ing about 1941 - ™42, yes. 
Q: All right, and then  you started school in the fall of ™38, and then  co mes kris Œ 

Kristallnacht
? 
A: Then Œ then, 
of course, comes 
Kristallnacht
, and the day my parents went off, 
having heard Œ I™m sure having heard that 
me n were being picked  up, being arrested 
at that point, my parents left town. 
Q: How much damage was done in your town? 

A: In our town not very 
mu ch. The synagogue was Œ the synagogue was burned Œ 
was Œ I bel Œ yes, the synagogue I think 
was destroyed, it wasn™t burned or Œ 
damaged, trashed. 

Q: When  you saw th at, what did that do to  you? 

A: Well, at that point, of course, one wa
s getting used Œ not ge
tting used to it, I 
mean, this was just one of many. Bu
t more importantly, my parents left 
Loerrach
 to 
go to 
Freiburg
. 
Q: With you? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
28
A: No, without me. 
I was staying in 
Loerrach
, I was staying at home. And my 
mother came back alone, my father 
was recognized on the street in  
Freiburg
 and 
arrested. And he 
was then off to 
Dach au 
concentration camp. Now that Œ at that 
point, things were obviously  very bad, so 
I was at home with my  mo ther. Of course, 
at that time we were Œ school was no lo ng er Œ you Œ Jews were no longer welcomed 
in Œ in Œ in Œ in the local sc
hools. So that didn™t particul
arly bother me, I wasn™t that 
great a student anyhow. In fact, if I re
me mb er correctly, I probably  would have 
flunked Latin in that year, if it hadn™
t been for that. An
d, but then yo Œ 
Q: So you didn™t feel cheated 
out by not having to go to school? 
A: No, I did not feel cheated at that point, 
but as I say, my Œ my dad was now off in 
concen tration camp, and my  mo th er and I struggle along at home. I Œ 

Q: How Œ how did she cope with  that? 

A: Well, under Œ under the circumstance I 
guess she coped very well, but she was not 
easy to live with, and I don™t see why she sh
ould be. I mean, you know at that stage 
of the game, the Œ the woman had a pretty 
tough time. I mean, I had it tough, but she 
had it a lot tougher.  

Q: Did she have enough money to 
Œ for living expenses, for food Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ was tha-that ever a problem? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
29
A: Yeah Œ no, that was not a problem at 
that point. And then of co urse, probably Œ 
well, it was about the middle of December, ab
out five weeks after, we Œ I remember 
vividly at getting a phone call at 11 o™clock at
 night, my father saying he™s at the 
railroad station in 
Munich
, and he™s coming home. There™s certain things that one 
reme mb ers vividly, and 
this was one of them. 
Q: Had you any communication wh ile Œ w
ith your father while he was in 
Dachau
? 
A: No, we Œ we knew where he wa Œ I me
an, we Œ he may have
 written once, but we 
knew wh ere he was, in other wo rds. 
Q: Why had your parents or
iginally gone back to 
F r eiburg
? They said Œ you said 
they left you in the town and 
then the two of them went to 
Freiburg
. Why did they 
make that trip? 

A: To get away Œ presumably
 to get away, in 
the event Œ because 
word was around 
that they were picking up Jewish males. 

Q: So they though they™d be safer in 
Freiburg
. 
A: So they thought 
Œ so  they th ought th
ey™d be safer in 
Freiburg
, and of course, 
having prev iously lived  in 
F r eiburg
, somebody obviously  pointed them out to 
somebody, and he was arrested on the stre
et. And as a result, my mother, who was 
not a very  good driv er Œ we Œ well, actu
ally, she was, she ha
d to drive home by 
herself. Come back by car, driving home, wh
ich mu st have been quite a Œ quite an 
experience. About that time my
 father was no longer able
, even before then, if I 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
30
remember correctly, he was not 
Œ no longer able to go into 
Switze rland
 
occasionally; my mother and I would go. But 
of course, after that, no, that was the 
end of that. 
Q: What did your father look like when  he came home? 
A: My father was in pretty bad shape. He
 had frozen le Œ his legs were frozen, his 

hands were Œ had frost Œ heavy frostbite. He 
looked in pretty ba
d shape, I remember 
that. And Œ 
Q: How old a Œ how old a man was he at that time? 
A: Well, at that point he was in hi
s mid-50s. No, mid™40s, late 40s. So Œ 
Q: Did he talk abou
t what happened at 
Dachau
 at all? Did he tell you anything? 
A: Not at that point. Again, that™s Œ you kno
w, they  wer Œ they Œ they used  to be Œ 
there used to be a standing joke in 
Germany
 that where one ma
n  meets  so me b ody  
who has just come back from concentration camp, and he said, how was Œ his friend 

asks him how was it. And the fellow who wa
s there say s, it™s great. You know, they 
woke us every mo rning with Œ with 
Beethoven™s Third Symphony
, and then  we had 
a leisurely breakfast, etcetera, etcetera. And 
of course his friend said, gee, that™s not 
the way my other neighbor tells it. He says
 yes, but he™s there again. So, you didn™t 
talk terribly much about it. This of course wa
s the Œ th-the word  Œ at that point things 
became terribly oppressive, and as a Œ as 
a Œ as a youngster yo
u Œ you Œ you Œ you 
knew it, and you started Œ you lived with it,
 and you Œ that was Œ that was the Œ you 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

31
knew you Œ one wrong step might be dangerous
 to you or to your family and so on. 
An-And that™s Œ th
at™s pretty tough. 
Q: Did you feel like a child th
en , or did you feel very ol
d because of that tension? 
A: Well, I feel I™ve really Œ 
to go to Œ in retrospect, I 
mean, we lost much of our 
childhood, after, I would say from Œ from age 
10 on, th ere wasn™t all that mu ch of a 
childhood Œ normal c h ildhood, of course. We
 had one in teresting experience ab out 
that time, and that is we had the Gestapo in
 our house. Now my experien Œ this is an 
experience that this was actually Œ may have 
been shortly befo re or after my  dad was 
in 
Da cha u
. We had our books at home, and we 
Œ they came in and started going 
through our Œ our books. A
nd th ey acted just like 
CPAs
 did, and it was perfectly Œ I 
mean, it was a Œ 
Q: The-These are financial books you™re talking ab out? 

A: Yeah. Our fi Œ I mean, this
 is what Œ this is what th
e Germans were interested in, 
of course, in our family. And so, you know, 
th-they were in our ho
use, and they were 
Œ I mean, I can™t say pleasant. They were
 Œ they were Œ there was no problem, I 
mean, other than uninvited 
CPAs
, let™s put it this way. So, it™s another phase of what 
the secret police did, you know, it™s Œ it wa
s the financial secret police, let™s put it 
this way. 

Q: Did th ey take the books with  them? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
32
A: No, they just sat there and went thro
ugh them, went down there. They  may have 
very well taken some along. Bu t then Œ 
Q: So now your fa
ther™s back from 
Dachau
. Did his health improve after he got 
home? 

A: Yes, we Œ we did have a non-Jewish do
ctor, if I remember correctly, who treated 
him and his health did improve, but Œ and ac
tually, I think he survived that Œ both 
physically and psychol
ogically, extremely well. 
Q: Was that against the law for that docto
r to treat you, the non-Jewish docto r, it was 
still okay? 

A: No, I Don™t think so , not at that point
. And then in 19 Œ 
comes 1939, and about 
mark Œ 

Q: Wha-Wh at did you do with yourself, 
since you couldn™t go to school? 
A: Well, I guess the same thing I did during
 vacation. I mean, I played, I maybe went 
to a certain extent, etcetera. There wasn™t Œ 
I Œ oh yes, I did go to  Œ I went to wo rk. 
There was a Jewish printer in
 town , and I did Œ did so me part time work  over there, 
trying to  ki Œ my  parents obvi
ously  try Œ I Œ tried to keep
 me busy, which was pretty 
valid. And so I reme mber work ing Œ work ing 
there. This was a f 
Œ a family that I 
worked for, they ha
d this print shop. 
Q: So this Jewish printer wa
s able to keep his business? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
33
A: Yeah, at that point they still were. This
 however, may also have been earlier, just 
may have been in 1938, but I suspect it 
was probably in early 1939 that this 
happened . And then  in April of Œ abou
t April of 1939, I went off on the 
Kindertransport to 
Switze rland
. 
Q: How did your parents arrange that? 

A: You know, we™re still try Œ I™m still try 
Œ I™m currently trying to find that out. It 
was a Œ not a large transport, it was Œ espe
cially since we lived right on th e Swiss 
border, I remember I was picked up, I wa
s taken by my  mo ther, I believe, to the 
railroad station, somebody th
ere on the Sw iss side, picked me up, took me on to 
Zu rich
 and so on. 
Q: How did your parents prepare you fo r that
, t Œ and tell you that you were going to 
be leaving them? 

A: I really don™t know. I don™t know. I do 
know I Œ no, I Œ I really Œ I really don™t 
know. I have no idea.  
Q: And you Œ 
A: We must have talked about it, they must
 have said this is probably the best thing 
you can do. It isn™t Œ since you can™t go 
to school, there is no Jewish Œ no Jewish 
school locally. There is Œ was no really 
that Œ terribly mu ch choice, if you had a 
choice, you know.

Q: And how does a 14 year ol
d boy react to knowing that 
he™s going to have to leave 
his family? 
A: Well, knowing th at I™ve Œ I Œ I don™t reca
ll that. I know how I reacted after I left. I 
ended up in a small, S w iss to
wn, and I™m Œ well, that™s not
 even a good size village 
[indecipherable]
 in a tiny little Swiss village with
 a Swiss farmer 
who had just a 
little before that, lost hi
s boy in an accident. 
Q: Had you taken anything special with you? 
A: No. 
Q: No sp ecial toys, or books, or whateve
r. Did your mother and father say anything 
that you can recall when th
ey Œ wh en you had to leav
e them at the station? 
A: No, I don™t recall. Chances Œ well, at th
at point, of course, we all were trying, I 
knew w-we were all trying to get out. And 
so anything I could do to get out, and I 
have just recently found something that 
somebody gave me, a postcard I wrote from 
Switzerland
 saying please, check on Œ on Œ on th
e Œ the affidavit, which my  parents 
needed, etcetera. 

Q: How many ch ildren were in your group, leaving 
Germ any
? 
A: That we Œ we were not a group, I was 
an individual. I was all by myself. No, this 
was not a big transport, this was arranged Œ in
 fact, just a few week
s ago, I ha Œ had a 
chance to meet with someb
ody else, whom I got to kn
ow there, and they are 
currently trying to find out under what 
ausp ices Œ I don™t even know under what

auspices I went to 
Switzerland
. All I know is I all sudden
ly found myself in this 
little Swiss village with a farm
 family. And that Œ that was Œ that was tough. Here 
comes Œ I mean, here comes Œ comes the city
 boy, and he sudden ly
 finds himself in 
this tiny Swiss village with a Œ out Œ out 
in the Œ out in the 
country, and it was 
different. It was difficult. I was not Œ I m
ean, for a while there I Œ this must have 
been about April, March - Apr
il I joined them, and they trea
ted me like their son, and 
it sort of reminds me of the old story, I 
treat everybody same, lik
e dogs. Not quite as 
bad as that, they meant well. They meant ex
tremely well, and they were very, in their 
own way, quite kind, but they weren™t qu
ite attuned to  me, and vice-a-versa.  

Q: Did th ey have any other children? 
A: No, they had lost their one child. 
Q: Wha-What village was this? 

A: This was a little to wn called 
Munch Altd orf
 on Lake 
Zu rich
, about 20 miles 
outside of 
Zu rich
. And Œ 
Q: And they  spoke German? 

A: Well, as good as the Swiss Œ German Sw
iss talks German, yes. Yes, they did talk 
a certain type of German, which I picked up
 and have retained. 
I stayed wi Œ lived 
with them, and then it came fall, I re Œ 

Q: What Œ what was the family name? 

A: 
Fuerst
. 
F-u-e-r-s-t
.

Q: And did they Œ how did they
 respond to your Jewishness?  
A: As best they could. I me
an, they knew I was Jewish. 
I was probably the first Jew 
they™d ever met. And there was obviously 
no Jewish family nearby. In fact, I don™t 
think that Œ well, there was a Jewish family
, these are the people
 I met again not too 
long ago. They were
 about 10 - 15 miles Œ 10 miles aw ay. 
Q: But when you got on Œ 
you said you were the only child traveling, and you 
traveled alone to 
Switzerland
. Who met you when  you got into 
Switzerland
? Or 
was there anybody on th
e t-train with you? 
A: Oh no, there was some
body on the train, there wa
s somebody who met me and 
then arranged for me to go on. I don™t r
ecall whether they went with me, and I was 
sort of passed on from one to the other. 

Q: So you were never by 
yourself until you got to 
the family. Did you have 
communication with  your parents while you were with the 
Fuerst
 family? 
A: Oh yes, oh yeah, I woul
d write, occasionally I would call. My parents had the 
telephone yet. And we woul
d be Œ we would be in t
ouch. And it was Œ it Œ that 
summer, I remember I agitated fo
r going back to school. The 
Fuersts
 weren™t 
particularly Œ I wouldn™t say anxious, but 
they Œ they weren™t 
Œ they Œ they ju st 
hadn™t given it too terribly mu ch th ought, a
nd I didn™t Œ did go to a school locally, 
starting that summer.  

Q: Did you work on the farm, 
and if so, what did you do? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
37
A: Oh God. Well, let me put it this way, 
yes I work ed on the farm. We did Œ it was Œ 
it was a dairy farmer, he had cows, a few co
ws, about 15 - 20. And so it was dairy, 
we lived across the street from th e dairy co
 Œ the milk collection point. And yes, I 
was supposed to watch the cows
 out in the field, wasn™t ve
ry good at it. Couple times 
they got away from me, and of
 course they knew where ho
me was, and th ey just Œ 
the fee Œ and the Swiss village, the village in
 the center, and then fields around it, and 
like most European farms, the 
f Œ the Œ the fields were so
rt of divided up. In other 
word s, your farmer would have one field 
east of town  and maybe another one north 
of town  and so on. So  we had th ese cows 
out there and ev ery no
w and then when the 
cows wanted to go home a
nd nobody came to get us, the cows just went home. I 
mean, I was not terribly successful as a co
w herder. And every now and then  I would 
trail the cows into town an
d shoo them in the other way 
around. I was supposed to 
lead them back. But, every 
now Œ and of course when th
ey go, they won™t go in a 
straight line, which means they go across th
e fields of the neighbors and so on. We 
did a certain amount of damage. I was not Œ 
I was not a great asset to the family, let™s 
put it this way. 
Q: Did you miss your parents? 
A: Yes, very much so, obviou
sly. I mean, as I say, these 
people tried very  hard, and I 
Œ I Œ you know, you Œ you Œ y
ou Œ they Œ they  did it, they
 had received no pay, they 
did it purely in order Œ and I don™t think 
th ey did it in order to get another farm

helper, I mean, that was not their Œ that Œ th
at was definitely not their reason. If they 
did, they sure lost out. No, they
 did it for humanitarian purposes. 
Q: Were they a very religious family? 
A: No, they were not. She was more
 religious than he was, but no. 
Q: But they didn™t try to convert you in  any way?  
A: They definitely did not tr
y to convert me. And then of 
course it was there that the 
Œ the ki Œ the social center of a very 
small S w iss village at that point, was the 
collection po Œ the dairy collection point, 
the local dairy, where everybody came 
every mo rning and ev ery evening to deliv
er their milk. So if there were any 
announcements of anything, this impor Œ of
 importance, this is where it would take 
place. People didn™t have teleph
ones. And, in fact, I used 
to have to go to the post 
office to make phone calls home. And it was 
Œ I™m Œ I must say also, I had relatives 
in 
Zu rich
, so I had somebody that I could be 
in touch with, it wasn™t that I was 
completely alone in that respect. O n e of
 the most Œ the things I remember most 
distinctly, and I guess from that
 I assume that I must have
 started really becoming 
interested in history and politics and so  
on, cause I remember
 when Œ when the 
German Russian non-aggression pact was 
sig n ed, I prin Œ I announced that this 
means ya Œ war in 
Euro pe
. Then of course I few week
 Œ couple weeks later, it 
actually started. And the announcements fo
r Œ mobilization announ
cements of course 
were posted at the milk collecting station.
 This is where ever
ybody came to. That

was early in the morning wh
en we got up and by noon 
everybody was getting on the 
local streetcar in a Œ in a uniform. So, 
you know, Sw iss Œ Sw iss ma les took their 
uniforms home and their wife will sew them 
after doing their military service. So it 
was a matter of Œ within  a matter of hours 
that they had Œ could mobilize the troops. 
Actually, the kids were mobilized too. I reme
mb er that at that point the swi Œ the kids 
were organized through the school, and I 
think I was part of the group that was 
supposed to help drive the 
cattle into the mountains. Judgi
ng from my experience in 
cattle driving before that, I™m not sure I 
would have contributed
 very much to the 
Swiss war effort, if it had of come to th
at. But it Œ fortunately didn™t. So I stayed 
there, but as I say, there were certain Œ th
e Œ we Œ we Œ we had 
certain, how shall we 
say, there were cer Œ a certain amount of
 friction between the family. I™m not Œ I 
don™t know who Œ to  whom to attribute it,
 I™m sure I shared it, I probably was a 
disappointment to them. I was not being ru
ralized very quickly 
while I was there. 
And so I think in Decembe
r of 1939, I was move Œ 
Q: What Œ were you still in contact w ith your parents once war broke out in 

September? 

A: Yes. Certainly by mail, prob Œ also la
ter on certainly, but I remember mak ing at 
least a couple of phone calls
, yes. And then  I was moved to another family, they 
arranged for me to be transferred. An
d I was then moved to a family, about 
December, on the other side of Lake 
Zu rich
, up in the mountain
s. A fundamentalist

Christian family. They li Œ he was a Œ he wa
s a gardener, and sold  flowers and sold Œ 
an-and raised flowers and so
 on. And that was a totally 
different experience. This 
was a refined family. And agai
n, absolutely no effort made
 to convert me . They bent 
over backwards to respect my
 Jew ishness. And I stayed
 with them until May of 
1940. 
Q: Were you hearing wh at was happening du
ring Œ during the war at that time, w h at 
was happening in
 Poland
, and others? 
A: Oh yes, I became an avid 
newspaper reader. Have be Œ 
have been one ever since, 
yes. No, no, I ke Œ I kept pretty well up to date. 

Q: Did that put you more on ed
ge, knowing what was happening? 
A: Oh yeah. Well, you didn™t need that, but
 Œ but obviously then
. Of course, one had 
no Œ wh at was happening to Jews was not at 
that point front page 
news. It of course 
hadn™t Œ also hadn™t started that way, you 
know. Germans were s
till Œ at that point 
were still encouraging emigration. And Œ 
but what was happening, yes, very 
definitely. 
Q: And also, wh ile you were with the second
 family in Œ in meeting other people in 

their town, did you sense any di
fficulties cause you were Jewish? 
A: Oh no, no. 

Q: You were fully accepted? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
41
A: Oh yeah Œ well, I wa Œ I wasn™t there 
that terribly long, but the family certainly 
fully accepted me. And I did not Œ at that poi
nt I did not go back to school once I Œ 
having been  up there. I think I helped them
 in Œ in their business and so on. I knew I 
would be leaving quite soon, or I assumed 
I would be leaving quite soon. But no, it 
was Œ it was my f Œ in neither place did I 
encounter the slightest anti-Semitism or Œ 
or feeling of Œ of Œ 
of not being wanted 
or anything like that. 
Q: So you felt safe in these two homes? 
A: Oh yes, oh yeah. First one 
not necessarily very happy, but
 safe, yes. And as I say, 
the Œ the second family was totally differe
nt. In fact, I think th ey co ntinued sending 
me ﬁ
The Watchtower
ﬂ for about 20 years. No, they 
Œ they Œ th ey Œ they were a 
lovely family. 
Q: What Œ what were their names? 

A: I was afraid you were gonna ask that.  

Q: Okay, it™ll come to you. So
 you stayed with them until? 
A: Well, then came Œ then came the next thing, and that was in May of 1940, my 

parents were called to 
Stuttgart 
to get their American visa. And I went back  to 
Germany
 to also get my  visa. We got back  Œ I got back  to 
Germany
, it mu st have 
been about the sixth or seventh of
 May. We went off to zi Œ to 
Stuttgart
 where the 
American consulate was located. I rememb
er reading on the mo rning of May 10
th
, a 
German newspaper in Œ while sitting in 
the American consulate. There was a

newspaper it said that a silly be Œ it wa
s a German newspaper, obviously. But this 
silly rumor was circulating that Germans we
re amassing troops f Œ aga Œ against the 
western front.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a 
continuation
 of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Gerald  Schwab
. This is tape numb er two, side
 
A
. And you had returned from 
Switzerland
, and you had gone with
 your family to 
Stuttgart
. 
Q: Well, as I say, sitting in the waiti
ng room of the Americ
an emb Œ American 
consulate in 
Stuttgart
, I was reading the newspaper, wh
ich said that foreign sources 
had reported  that German troops were mass
ing on the western front, and the German 
news agency had obviously said this was 
ridiculous. That was the day in wh ich the 
Germans invaded the lowlands. So  that was May 10
th
, 1945 Œ 
Q: 1940. 

A: 1940 is right. 1940, and that™s the da
y we got our Œ our vi
sa. We then scooted 
back to 
Loerrach
, stayed there I believe about two 
or three days. In the meantime, 
Freiburg
 had been bombed, the first German c
ity to be bombed in response to the 
invasion of the lowland; I think three pl
anes came over. And we were then, I believe, 

about the 15
th
 of May we were in 
Genoa
, in 
It a l y
. 
Q: Wai-Wai-Wai-Wait, let™s not 
go so fast. You heard that 
Freiburg
 was bombed, 
and you had been  born there.
 Any thoughts, any reaction? 
A: Well, actually, we knew 
Freibu rg
 had been bomb ed beca
use the train took us 
through 
Freiburg
, but you couldn™t see anything. No , 
not Œ not particularly, at that 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
44
point I think I felt this is 
a pretty good idea. It was not mu ch of a bomb ing, as 
bombings went later on, as I say. Three 
planes apparently came over, and since any 
time a place in 
Germany
 was bomb ed, it was bound to 
hit a hospital or a school, if 
you listened to that, and I think they said 
a school had been hit. But anyhow, very 
few people, very few casualties. B u t it 
wa Œ it was Œ it was Œ I didn™t feel any 
particular regret, let me put
 it this way. Interesting Œ 
Q: You didn™t feel 
regret about what? 
A: About the bombing having taken place 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Why? 
A: Well, at that stage of the game, I cert
ainly no longer felt like a G erman, let™s put it 
this way. 

Q: What did you feel like?  

A: Gee, I don™t know. I couldn™t Œ I d 
Œ I don™t know. Bu t anyhow, what was 
interesting was tro Œ taking the train from 
Freiburg
 or from 
Loerrach
. The train 
goes a Œ went along the 
Rhine 
River, going north before
 it turned eastward to 
Stuttgart
. This was the border between 
France
 and 
Germany
 an d of course this 
was before be Œ this being the ninth Œ May 
eighth or ninth. This
 was during the days 
of the Œ of the so called 
Sitzkrieg
 and nothing going on. An
d you could easily look 
into 
France
. And th e French obviously saw th
e train on the German side, and 
nobody did anything to anybody. Going 
back, it was quite different. Going back, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
45
whenever you ca Œ when you came to Œ near the 
Rhine
, the train stopped, and then 
you were bused to a place where the 
Rhine
 Œ no longer the border, or the train was 
no longer within view 
of the tra Œ of the Œ the Œ the 
French military. In
 other words, 
they finally started shooting at each othe
r a little bit. And this started on the 10
th
 of 
May, of course. But anyhow, we went back  to 
Loerrach
. Presumably Œ I can™t recall, 
but we collected some effects, things had 
been packed already and so on, and Œ what 
hadn™t been sold or given aw
ay. And we went off, over the 
Brenner Pass 
to 
Italy
, to 
Genoa
, and I think we arrived there about the 15
th
. Now one of the things that had 
been Œ we also did while we were in 
Stuttgart
 was, my father went to the Italian 
consulate to get a visa for 
Italy
. He speeded things up by 
making a quote, charitable 
contribution, unquote, to some 
Italian charity, and he got hi
s visa the same day. This 
was on th e 10
th
 of May. And by the 15
th
 we were in 
Italy
, and by the 18
th
 we were 
aboard  ship, on our way to the 
U.S.
 
Q: Was this a very stressful journey for 
you, the wa Œ going th rough ital Œ you know, 
the 
Brenner Pass
 in-into 
Italy
? 
A: Stressful Œ well, until you 
were Œ you were across the 
border, obviously at that 
point, I me an, yes. You were stressful if Œ and Œ 
Q: What were the border crossings like? 
A: I Œ nothing. I mean, it was Œ it was lik
e any border, it was a border crossing in 
Euro pe
 in the old days. It was a fairly care
ful contro l, but that was Œ that was 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

46
something one was used to. In
 other word s, the Œ the days of easy Œ this was not the 
days of easy border crossings for anybody
. And so  they would ch eck the luggage, 
and they  would check the passports, etcetera. 
Q: Did your parents give y
ou any advice about wh at to say, or wh at not to say? 
A: I™m sure my parents did. I don™t recall wh
at it was, but I™m sure th ey did. But you 
learn, by that point, not to open your mo
uth unnecessarily, even
 though that was 
difficult sometimes.  

Q: So you said you were
 happy to leave the co
untry  of your birth? 
A: Oh yes, very much so. 
Yeah, at this point, I mean, it may have been the Œ the 
country of my  birth, but I certainly had no 
warm feelings towards it, that Œ that™s the 
nature of the game. Th-The events of th
e past two or three years had pretty well 
taken care of that. 
Q: Had your awareness of being Je
wish intensified at this point? 
A: I don™t think that there was any need for 
that, or Œ or Œ I mean one Œ it was part of 
one™s make-up, and I would sa
y no, probably  not. But it
 hadn™t decreased either, I 
mean, it hadn™t Œ it had stayed pr
etty Œ pretty well the same.  
Q: So now you get on th
e boat to come to the 
United States
, which boat was it? 
A: Which what? 

Q: What was the name of the boat? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
47
A: The 
George Wa shington
. Good name. And of course, wh
ile we were in the high 
seas, 
Italy
 Œ 
Q: What Œ what line was it? 
A: It was a 
U.S. 
line, I guess 
United States
 line, I™m not sure, 
but Œ and while we 
were in the high seas, of course, 
It aly
 declared war on 
France
, wh ich would have 
cut that route off, so it was 
the last ship, or one of th
e very last ships to leave 
Italy
 
for the 
United States
. 
Q: Were there many other Jewish 
refugees on the boat with you? 
A: Yes, I believe Œ well, there were quite 
Œ I would say th ere were a number of them, 
yes. 

Q: Did you all stay together? 
A: No, no. I wa Œ I was too 
busy exploring the ship an d 
so on. I mean, I was the Œ I 
was rather inquisitive and there was Œ there wa
s too much to be Œ to be explored, too 
many things to be done, and so on. 
Q: Were there many other teenagers? You 
were 15 years old, were th ere many other 
children your age bracket? 

A: I don™t recall. I mean, we were not Œ 
we Œ I Œ I believe there were, and Œ but I 
don™t Œ really don™t recall any spec
ific group or people or so on. 
Q: What countries did the 
other refugees come from? 

A: No id ea. Don™t know.

Q: And so how long was the voyage? 
A: Well, in those days it probably
 was seven to eight days. Got to 
New Yo rk
 Œ 
Q: What was that Œ what was that like to 
put your feet on Œ wh
at Œ what had you Œ 
been your thoughts on the 
United States
 by the Œ at that time? 
A: Well, it was Œ it was recognition of a 
new beginning, 
it was a recognition of it 
being something totally different. And it wa
s Œ it was an on Œ a Œ a new adventure, 
let™s put it this way. 
Q: Was it very emotional for your pare
nts to put their feet down on Œ on the 
American ground? 
A: You mean at the very beginning? 
Q: Yeah, o-on Œ upon arrival. 
A: No Œ yeah Œ no, I think at that point
 they had cut their 
Œ they Œ they had 
emotionally cut their ties with 
Germany
, with  Œ you know, comp letely. I mean, they 
Œ they did not pine for the ol
d country, let™s put it this 
way. No, they Œ they were 
ready to make the change and th
ey Œ they Œ they were ready. 
Q: What was your first sight of the 
United States
? 
A: I think it probably  was the Statue of Liberty or 
Ellis Island
 or whatever. But Œ 
and then  of course it did Œ it was Œ it was all 
a Œ a Œ sort of a blur at that point. Of 

course, we were met by all our relatives, wh
o in the meantime had gotten together in 
New York
. They als Œ

y in May of 1940?

th
 of May. And they met us, and then 
we moved in with one of my  uncles and au
nts Œ one of my  uncle and aunt, who they

 earlier, and that™s where we went first of all.

, in the 
Bronx
. Very much in the 
Bronx
, yes. And then 
it was a matter, of course, getting acclimated
, or getting acclimat
ed and getting used 
to this city. I mean, you 
have to keep in mind, 
Freiburg
 is a sm Œ is a town, 
Loerrach
 is a small town. Th
e places I was in 
Switzerland
 were tiny villages, and 
then you had 
New York
. So it wa Œ it was Œ it™s a shock to the system, but not a 
negative one, it™s ju
st a plain shock. 
Q: Did you know any En
glish at that point? 
A: Yes and no. I did try out a new word  on 
one of my  cousin s, took me down to the 
street and I can™t recall what it was, we met 
some kids down on th e street in front of 
the house, in front of the apartment buildin
g, and I tried out another word , and that™s 
when  I discovered that that probably was no
t the appropriate one, because he just hit 
me in the side of th
e head. I got a nice big lump  on th
e side of my head. My mother 
almo st fainted when  she saw it.
 It looked a lot Œ I™m sure
 it looked a lot worse than it

was. But anyhow it Œ he taught me very qu
ickly that word s and language, necessarily 
Œ just because you know the 
word does not nece
ssarily mean that it™s appropriate. 
Then of course, I think we stayed th
ere about two weeks and then something 
happened  to  me that was probably of great 
value to me. I had another uncle and aunt 
Œ an aunt. She had come to the 
United States
 already in the 20s, so they both had 
come to the 
States 
in the 20s. And they were gr
eat outdoors people, they loved 
hiking. And they to ok me, within ab
out two weeks of arriving in  the 
States
, they 
took me out for a two week hi
ke in the mountains, in the 
Adirondacks
 or someplace, 
and told  everybody, or every one of their fri
ends to talk only Eng
lish to me. So this 
was what we would today call deep immers ion, and it was great because after two 
weeks I had a fairly decent command of th
e language. That Œ you know, th e Œ it was 
Œ it was a little rough at the time, because 
you get frustrated in going through it, but 
in retrospect, or even at that point, I me
an, immediately afterwards, or even at the 
time, you recognize that this is the way to
 go. And then th ings happened fairly 
quickly after the Œ went in fairly rapid 
succession. I remember 
my  mo th er wen t  to  
work  in one of the 
New York 
sweat shops as a sewing machine operator, and where 
one of my  aunts wo rked, and sh e Œ that wa
s her first job. That™s one the real, I 
wouldn™t say untold  stories, but it™s one of
 the things that I mu st say we have not 
given quite enough reco gnition to it, althou
gh I™m sure it happens even today that 
some of these people make these changes an
d they™re tremendous. I mean, adapted in

ways that is unimaginable perhap s to us t
oday. Although I™m sure th at a lot of ref Œ 
other refugees, refugees today, who may 
be doing th e same thing I do. Anyhow, my  
mo ther went to Œ did th is Œ did Œ became
 a sewing machine operator. And then we 
moved to  
Lo ng  Bra n ch
, 
New Jersey
, where I went to school, and my  mo ther and 
father worked as a maid and a sort of 
a handyman-butler with  a family, with a 
New 
York
 lawyer. And, now, it was amazing that my
 mother could do it, but the fact that 
my father suddenly 
became a sort of handymaid Œ ha
ndyman-chauffeur and jack-of-
all-trades w as also quite amazing. And we st
ayed there, I remember I went to school 
there. I Œ 
Q: Were you accepted by 
the other children? 
A: Oh yeah, y
eah, I mean Œ 
Q: They didn™t tease you ab out an accent? 

A: Well, well, no. One reason of course was 
when  you enter a school at the mi ddle of 
the year and so on, and mo st of these school
s, there are already groups and cliques, 
you™re Œ you™re pretty well 
on your own. Kids don™t real
ly take terribly mu ch  notice 
of you, unless you want to be noticed. 

Q: Were you hearing ab out wh at was happening in 
Europe
? 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, at that
 point I certainly did. I wa
s an avid newspaper reader, 
listening to the radio and so on. Beside 
going to  school, I work ed. I became a Œ 
setting up pins in a bowling 
alley. Those were the days before the automatic

pinsetters. Broke a finger in the process, 
you catch it between two bowling balls. It 
was a fairly  dangerous sport.
 I work ed on th e beach in 
Lo ng  Bra n ch
, dishing out ice 
cream during the summer. That sort of thi
ng. And then my  parents, I think this 
family no longer could afford 
a co uple Œ he Œ they were 
Œ he had once run as ri Œ 
congressman in a Œ for 
congress in a heavily de
mocratic d istrict in 
New York Œ 
of 
course, he was a republican, so he only ran,
 he never did get Œ he didn™t get elected. 
He was Œ they were Œ seemed to be very 
nice people. And at that point my  parents 
then went and went to a trai
ning school, run by either the 
Joint
 or somebody like 
that, and they became farmers. They became in poultry farming. Now this wasn™t 
quite as wi Œ far removed as being a butle
r and a handyman, because my  parents, the 
town they had come fro
m, the parents, the Œ their parents were involved 
in Œ in cattle 
dealing an d so on. So it was a farm commun
ity. And lo and behold
, after they Œ they 
did this and I think they  went through 
training, there was a training unit near 
[indecipherable]
 
New Jersey
, and Œ or 
Bo und
 
Brook
, 
New Jersey
. And after that, 
they Œ with the aid of Œ of the 
Joint
, they bought a poultry farm in a place, in 
Cranberry
, 
New Jersey
, which is next to 
Hightstown
, which is near 
Princeton
. 
And that was in 19 Œ that mu st have been 
in  19 early ‚40 Œ I guess late ‚40 Œ middle 
™41. And they then Œ I went to school ther
e, and th ey had the poultry farm there. I 
went to 
Hightstown
 first Œ well, now I actually Œ I guess I went to 
Hightsto wn
 
High. Must have been  in the fall of 19 Œ 
hm. No, we Œ yeah, mu st have been in

spring of 1941, because we were already 
there when the war broke out. Well, it Œ 
certainly in ™41. I went to high school 
there, had a Œ you know, I was Œ I was a new 
kid in to wn, it was pleasant enough. I went to 
Hightstown
 High. Had no untoward 
experiences there except apparently the Engl
ish teacher told another class that she 
didn™t believe wh at I was saying about having left 
Germany 
in  1940, because my  
English was too good. And we were then ther
e in June of Œ I remember in June of 
1941 when the war br
oke out with the Russians. The 
German-Russian was broke out. 
I believe that™s where we were. Anyhow,
 in 19 Œ some time in 1941 because I do 
remember distinctly where I was on 
Pearl Ha rbor
 Day. And my folks then ran this 
farm, which at that time Œ this was the days
 before the cholesterol scare, and reduced 
meat production, so the egg business 
became  a very Œ quite a good one.  

Q: And did you wo rk on th e farm with 
them, or did you just go to school? 
A: Oh no, I Œ I did 
work on the farm. 
Q: And any connection w
ith family back in 
Europe
? 
A: No. At that point we really had Œ no
, we were very fortunate. We had no close 
family in 
Europe
 any more. We were basically the 
last ones to get out. I mean, there 
were obviously family and acquaintances, but no close family, and there was no 
contact with anybody any mo re, but Œ 
Q: So then life continue
d on with you til you grad
uated from high school? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
54
A: No, I actually had two years of high sch
ool. I Œ til 1943. At that point my father 
prevailed upon the local draft board not to
 draft me because I was needed for farm 
work. And before too long I 
decided I looked like I was 
gonna miss the war, which I 
did not want to miss. And I went to the dr
aft board  and says, I™m ready. And actually 
then was called up and went Œ went off in 
Œ in middle of 1944. Joined  the brig a Œ 
joined the army, basic training, Camp 
Blanding
,
 Florida
. 
Q: Were you a citizen at this point? 
A: No, I got my citizen ship I think in 
Jacksonville
,
 Florida
 while in the army, while 
in basic training. It was a Œ a-any day that
 you could get out of
 basic training was a 
day won. So, you know, it was great beco
ming an American citizen, it was equally 
great to get out of one 
day of basic training. 
Q: How did it feel to put on an American army  unifo rm, after you had escaped from 
Euro pe
? 
A: Oh, it felt great, it felt absolutely great. 
I later on wo re it back to Œ even  though it 
Œ well, we™ll get to that later, but anyhow I Œ I did wear it back to 
Loerrach
, in the Œ 
even though that was in th
e French zone. I wore it in 
Switzerland
. Oh yes, it was Œ it 
was great. 
Q: So you™ve comp leted basi
c training, and then what? 
A: Well, then I c-completed basic training,
 I was supposed to go out and suddenly 
the army just ad Œ I was asked, just as we
 were shipping out to 
basic training, I was 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

55
a-a-asked where my second pair of glasse
s were. Well, the army had issued me one 
pair, but I had never gotten a second pair. And I was heartbroken to  find th at I could 
not ship  out with Œ w
ith the people I trained with. They
 me Œ they were sent overseas 
and before long they  were 
caught in the Battle of the Bulge. I, on the other hand, 
stayed around fo r two mo re w
eeks. At that time they 
didn™t have this one hour 

eyeglass service, otherwise I would have al
so been probably in
 the Battle of the 
Bulg e. And I got, about two weeks later, I Œ 
my  second pair of metal rimmed glasses, 
and I was off to 
Italy
, and became a me mb er of the 10
th
 Mountain Division. And as I 
say, joined the 10
th
 Mountain Division and was in the 87
th
 regiment, 
E
 company, and 
saw combat with them in northern
 Italy
. 
Q: So y-y-you were actua
lly in comb at, you said. 
A: Yes, yes. 
[indecipherable]
 We ended up, after the war, or when the war was 
over, we were in northern 
Italy
. We were in Œ on Lake 
Garda
 when  the war was 
over. And about five days later, w h ile sort
 of trying to  recuperate from what had 
been a fairly strenuous few week
s, I got orders to go down  the 
Fifth Army
 
headquarters, where I b
ecame an interpreter.  
Q: What was Œ do you think 
your experience in combat 
was different because of 
where you had co me from, what you brought
 with you Œ you know, your experience 
with the Germans. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
56
A: Well, my experience in combat was 
different because we 
had a crazy comma nd Œ 
battalion commander, who decided that patrol
s going out at night would be greatly 
enhanced by having a German
 speaker with them. And regrettably, we only had two 
men in the battalion who sp oke good German. So
 either he or Œ or I went out in mo st 
patrols at night. I mean, I Œ I would go out 
and patrol with our own comp  Œ fo r Œ for 
me Œ patrol for my  own comp any, and fo
r other comp anies. And then  he had an 
accident and shot himself, or shot ca Œ shot
 himself through the hand, so then there 
was one of us. So I never needed to  use Œ 
or never did use my  German in patrol at 
night. But th e experience, yes, I had a few interesting incidents. I me an, one 
particular thing, we were the first unit to cross the 
Po
 River in northern 
Italy
 and 
marching along either side of the road with  th
e Œ in Œ in Œ sort of in a ditch, and I was 
at the head. I mu st say, I didn™t volunteer 
for these things, I usually was volunteered. 
And a bicycle rider came down the middl
e of the street, uniform, and coming 
towards us. And he came and came bef Œ I 
thought somebody was going to  shoot the 
poor guy, because he obvi
ously didn™t know what wa
s going on. And finally I 
jump ed out of the ditch and went up and in
 my  best German stopped him. And he 
started arguing with me in German because th e 10
th
 Mountain uniforms were very 
much like German parachuter uniforms, a
nd he thought he had en co untered another 
amer Œ German unit, and he was telling me 
that he had a very important message for 

the comma nding general. Well, we were obvi
ously very interested in that. And Œ 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

57
Q: So you captured him?  
A: Oh yeah, sure. And so we Œ it was Œ 
you know, there were some  incidents like 
that, but Œ but Œ 
Q: W-Were you involved
 in actual fighting? 
A: I Œ 
Q: Were you involved 
in actual fighting? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, I Œ I e
nded up with the Œ with th
e Œ with the Œ with the 
infantryman™s badge, and all this sort of 
thing. Which was actually the nicest thing 
you could get in the 
U.S. 
Army , in Œ if you had to be in  comb at, because it meant 10 
dollars a month mo re in your pay.  
Q: Did you take any German life? Did you
 take any German life? Did you sh oot at 
any Germans? 
A: Did I that I know of? You know, war very
 frequently is, except for hand to hand 
comb at, which we did not get into, war is
 very impersonal. So to answer your 
question, I don™t know. But that wouldn™t 
have bothered me one iota. But no, we 
then, as I say, after the war was over, I got 
transferred to Œ I was told to go on detail 
to 
Fifth Army
 headquarters and there I became th
e Œ one of the interpreters in 
Mark 
Clark 
Œ General 
Mark Clark™s 
staff.  
Q: What city is this? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
58
A: Well, the Œ this was on Œ in 
Gardone Riviera
, right on Lake 
Garda
, one of these 
great big magnificent hotels. Three months of
 it, a real tough life. And they had a 
German general staff un
it there. The Colonel 
Schweinitz
 was in charge. This was a 
German unit that was responsible for getti
ng th e Germans out of the north ern Italian 
Alps
 to surrender, and to organize it. And so 
th ey had Œ they had 
a staff there, and I 
was basically the interpreter between 
the Americans and the Germans there. 
American units and German units. 
Q: You are what, 20 years old now? 
A: Yeah, I was Œ 

Q: And you are interrogati
ng these German officers? 
A: No, I was Œ 

Q: Or transla Œ translating. 

A: Oh yeah, I was tran slating actually. I 
was Œ I was interpreting between them and 
you know, they™re pretty high level in th
e German army , and they  often wanted  to 
know why I spoke such  good German. I made 
absolutely no secret of it, and it was 
an interesting sp  Œ probably  
the funniest experience there 
was, sitting once in the car 
between two Œ two generals, and at that time I™m 
[indecipherable]
 I mean, I had 
been promoted at that point to priv ate firs
t class. And I sudden ly burst out laughing. 
Now, one doesn™t do that when one is a 
PFC
 between two generals, but I Œ I burst 
out laughing, and they both wa
nted to know why. And I said, well, it™s a pretty  silly 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
59
Œ funny situation, because the one man on my
 left was the German chief cha Œ chief 
chaplain of the 
German army in 
It aly
, and the guy on the right
 was the chief chaplain 
of the American army. And I basi
cally said, you know, it™s kind of 
[indecipherable]
 
to have a little Jew in between you, and you 
need me to get together. So that was one 
of the mo re Œ that was Œ that happened dur
ing that period. My German was good, but 
it was certainly not technically all that gr
eat. It was, you know, 15 year old boy™s 
German. But it got me into some interes
ting places like the German underground 
communications facilities in 
Verona
, where all the German telephone lines and so 
on came together. Then  one side you had 
the chief American engineers and the 
German engineers and I was in between. 
Fortunately, when it came to technical 
terms they were able to Œ to communicate without me. I sort of f
illed in the gaps in 

between. But I was there for three months
, and then was transferred to a Œ to 
something called 
USDIC
, 
United States 
Detailed Interrogation Center. This was a Œ 
an interrogation group, which at that point was located in 
Verona
, 
Italy
, and from 
Italy
 we then transferred and we moved to  
Austria
, town like Œ the name of 
Gmunden
 in upper
 Austria
, where we set up an interrogation center. And most 
everybody in that unit sp
oke German, or a great many spoke German. And Œ 
Q: Were many of them refugees like you? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes. I mean, the 
United States
 didn™t have all that many people at that 
point who were pro Œ sufficiently proficient in English and German, and knew 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

60
something about German
 army , you know, ger Œ you know. And th e 
USDIC 
in 
Gmunden
 was set up to this interrogation center, held 
VIP
 or medium 
VIP
 prisoners 
for interrogation. They were interrogated th
ere, and we had a large number of cells. 
And I guess I™m not revealing an y mo  Œ anythi
ng that™s secret any more, but at that 
point, we had concealed microphones built in
to the individual cells, and I spent most 
of my time sitting with earphones, listeni
ng to these conversations, or recording 
them. Some of them were Œ some of them 
were quite interesting. And so I spent Œ 
that started about Ju
ly 1940 Œ or mu st have been 
August, I guess, 1945, so Œ in  
Austria
. 
Q: When you say they were interesting 
conversations, can you say anything about 
that, or you™d rather not? 
A: Well, it got pretty crude 
wh en  you have tw o female Ge
rman youth leaders talking 
about their sex life, for instan
ce, or Œ all sorts of things. 
Q: Did they talk about Jews at all? 
A: No, at this point they  didn™t. No t Œ no
t really. There was nothing Œ it was basically 
material that you wanted to give Œ provide 
to the interrogators, to probe, and so on. 
Q: What was your response after the war wh
en you learned of wh at had happen ed to 
the Jews, and th e camps had been opened? 
A: Well, at that point of course, we
 had Œ near where we were, we had 
Eben see
, the 
camp. 
Mauthausen
 was not too far away. Oh, I gue
ss, what can you describe it?

Anger, frustration, rage, you name it. I must
 say that this Œ I had great problems as 
far as the A u strian concerned. In my b
ook I once wrote that what took Germans six 
year Œ t-t-took six years to establish certai
n measures against the Jews, the Austrians 
were able to do in six w
eeks. And it was Œ w-we got Œ the whole unit, I would say, 
got pretty sick and tired of 
being told how glad  they we
re to see us, and how they 
had suffered under the Ge
rmans, and so on.

, which was alternately being used 
by th e Au strian population, a 
mo vie theater, and also fo r plays, and as a movie house 
for the American troops, the 10
th

in Œ in Œ in Œ in the 
USDIC
 we finally got sick and tired
 of being told  of how the 
Austrians had suffered, that we found a ne
wsreel of Germans Œ troops marching into 
Gmunden
, and we to ld the projectionist to 
play it in connec
tion, without any 
comment, in connection with th e next time he was Œ had a movie showing fo r the

and we didn™t hear this

Q: Then you stayed in th
at location for how long? 
A: Well, I stayed there until December 1945.
 At that time I got, on two days™ notice I 
was told I could 
go back to the 
U.S.
 on 
R 
and
 R
, rest and recuperation. I had the 
requisite numb er of points. 
You Œ you were give
n points by Œ for Œ for overseas duty 
and co mb at and so on, and they  
were taking people back  to the 
States
 for rest an d 
recuperation. So off I went and came back to the 
States
, surprised my folks, and then 
went back . In the meantime I had decided I 
wanted to go to wo rk
 at one of the war 
crimes trials. And Œ 
Q: You decided this? Y-You 
say, y-you made the decisi
on. Why? What brought you 
to that decision, or what 
factors entered into that? 
A: Well, I decided it would be a fairly inte
resting closure. I me an, it would be an 
interesting experience. And it would be the so
rt of thing I wanted to do. Now, I did 
ha Œ well, I Œ 

Q: Was this from a historical prospective, or emotional prospective? 
A: I would say both. It was both. But wh en  I got to th e 
Sta t es
, and I remember I got 
back to Fort 
Dix
, ready to get on the next ship  to 
go back overseas
, I was told, I™m 
sorry, you will re Œ you can™t 
go back overseas. Why not? 
He says, well, the Œ with 
the war over in the Far East, and all this so
rt of thing, the only way you can go back 
overseas is if you re-enlist.
 Otherwise, you can™t go back
. Well, I wanted to go back 
pretty badly, I wanted to go back  to my  
unit. And so I did something in a mo ment of

63
youthful exuberance, I re-en
listed, and signed up, and th
ey changed the orders and 
they Œ I said, you Œ they  Œ 
go back. And I went back, ca
me back overseas. Got to 
Cherbourg
, and there they had me going to  some other unit in northern 
Germany
 or 
someplace, and I screamed and 
yelled as much as a Œ at th
at point I™d been promoted 
to corporal Œ as much a corporal can do. 
And they said all right, they finally Œ I 
reme mb er, I think I had to change a couple 
hundred orders, becaus
e they had about a 
hundred, couple hundred people on Œ on these 
orders to a certain place, and I had to 
go through each and every one of them and 
rule out my name; they let me do that. 
And so they sent me back, they said
 fine, you can go ba
ck to your unit in 
Austria
. 
And I got to 
Paris
 and in 
Paris
 I stayed at the enlis
ted men™s billets in 
Paris
, and 
this was Œ the gods really to
ok kindly to me because when
 I was Œ I stayed there for 
two days, and I was then
 ready to  go back to  
Austria
. I tried to get my duffel bag, 
and lo and behold, it had been stolen. 
Now this wouldn™t normally be a tragedy 
except all my personnel papers were in ther
e. So I got some temporary papers, went 
back to 
Austria
 and of course I forgot to tell them
 that I had re-enlisted. So I guess 
I™m a fugitive from Œ from Œ from militar
y justice. And got back to Œ to 
Austria
, 
stayed there until Œ 
in the meantime I Œ 
I traveled to both 
Da cha u
 and to  
Nuremberg
. 
Q: This is traveled on your own? 
Was this your first time back in 
Germany
?

my first time back in 
Germany
 was in Œ when I was still in 
Œ I guess probably when  I was in 
Verona
, so it must have been about August. I 
traveled to 
Germany
, and I traveled to 
Switzerland
 in uniform. At that point you 
could go to 
Switzerland
. And Œ 
Q: You Œ you had men
tioned th at earlier, so if you can expand a little bit about 
coming into  
Germany
 wearing an American army uniform. 
A: Yeah, I sort of strutte
d around. I went back  to 
Germany
, to my  old haunts, met a 
few people who knew me. Notic
ed that there were a lot of people behind curtains 
looking at this weird American walking in 
the street. Keep in mi
nd you™re in the fr Œ 
I™m Œ I was in the French zone, I did no
t look like a French
 soldier. Wandered 
around, went to 
Breisach
 wh ere my  parents had lived  
and were born, and went to 
Freiburg
. Met Œ as I say, met some people. And then  Œ 
Q: Do any of them Œ any of the Germ
ans whom you knew Œ who knew you before 
say anything to you, especially? 
A: Oh yeah Œ well, you mean, before? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, especially in 
Breisach
 and in Œ in  Œ in  
Loerrach
, oh yes. These 
were people who knew me. 

Q: Were they welcoming to you?

A: Oh yeah, those people were. The others st
ayed out of Œ I assume
 stayed out of the 
way because I didn™t run into any of th
e others. The one person I looked for, I 
couldn™t find. 
Q: Did you feel like you be
longed in these places? 
A: Oh heavens no, I wa Œ I felt lik e a c
onquering hero. No , I felt anything but. 
Q: Did you feel very Œ very American? 
A: Yes, very much so. Abou
t 150 percent. Yeah, it™s Œ it™
s pretty heady fo r a 20 year 
old, you know, I mean, it™s Œ when a want Œ 
wh en you sort of run at age 15 and come 
back as Œ as a me mb er of Œ of Œ of a vict
orious army, oh yeah, it feels very good.  
Q: Did you go ab out it Œ back to  
Dach au
 because of your father™s experience? 
A: No, I went to Œ because the set of tria
ls were coming up there. And I went there 
and then  I decided I would rather go to  
Nuremberg
. 
Q: Why? 

A: Well, it seemed lik e the more interesting, 
more Œ historically more interesting so rt 
of thing to do. 

Q: Was it painful for you to be at 
Dach au
 wh en Œ knowing your father had been  
there? 
A: Yes, well, painful n Œ well, I don™t know
 whether you would call it painful, it was 
Œ it was emotionally wrenching, but not Œ you
 know. But anyhow, I went back to my 
unit, arranged to get my  army  discharge in 
Vienna
, and off I went to 
Nuremberg
. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

Q: So you went as a civilian to 
Nuremberg
, oh.  
A: Yep. I left the army
 in Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Vien na
 and Œ in  May of 1946, moved to 
Nuremberg
 as a civilian. 
Q: And what happened wh en you got there? 
A: Well, you know, you were assigned billets
, you were Œ they ha
d previously gi Œ 
tested me, they had decided that I probably
 wouldn™t make a terribly good Œ which I 
agreed with Œ a terribly good court interpreter,
 or an interpreter in
 the court, but they 
did decide to use me as an interpreter wh
ere you had co nsecutive interpretation, and I 
basically spent all my time either as a 
translator, which mean
s on written documents, 
or as an interpreter working Œ 
well, here I should digress. The 
Nuremberg
 Trials 
actually had 22 main defendants, but in a
ddition to th at, it had seven organizations 
which were on trial. Things like the 
SA
, the 
SS
, the general staff, the 
Reich™s
 
cabinet. The idea being that if the members 
of the organization, if the organization 
were declared as guilty of war crimes, then
 members above a certain level, or maybe 
at any level, would automatically be co
nsidered as Œ as guilty. And now, since 
however there were too many people that 
either wanted to testify, or provide 
affidavits, or statements in connection with 
th ese things, separate hearings were held, 
in a separate room, before a public, but th
ey  were done in  German and English. And 
so you had, there you had,
 before a commissioner, th
e chief commissioner was an 
Englishman who later on met an untimely de
ath as being a Œ he was a secretary for

north ern 
Ireland
 in the British cabinet, and his ca
r bl Œ got blown up. And so you 
had th-the Œ you had four, actually four
 commissioners; you had an American, you 
had a Britisher, you had a Fren
chman and you had a Russian.
 But all the discussions, 
all the ti Œ the Œ the testimony was in Eng
lish and German, and 
instead of having 
immediate translation, simu ltaneous transl
ation, you had consec
utive. But you had 
only one interpreter, so you Œ you had on
e person doing English to German, ger Œ 
and German English.  
Q: Wa Œ were these additional trials calle
d the subsequent proceedings, or th at was 
something else?  
A: No, this was part of the first, main tr
ial, w h ere you for inst
ance had Œ and you had 
actually then, decisions of guilt and innocence  of these various organizations, like the 

German general staff, 
and by virtue of sort of concen
trating, these were the people 
that were on Œ were being he
ard at that point. I spent mu
ch of my time working with 
witnesses f o r the German 
general staff. People like 
von Rundsted t
, 
Kesselring
, 
Manstein
, etcetera. And Œ 
Q: So what kind of contact did you have, 
or was this strictly during the hearings? 
A: No, th is was one of the nice things in th is, because 
A
, the interpreter sat right next 
to the witness. These were not defendants, the main defendants never came. These 

were people that testified. Some of them 
were subject later on to subsequent trials. 

And others then were, for instance, 
[indecipherable]
 
Dieter Wisliceny
, who was Œ 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
68
was what™s his name™s deputy. 
Heydrich
. No, not 
Heydrich
, 
Eichmann™s 
deputy 
was one of the people that testifie
d, and he later on was sent off to 
Poland
, where he 
was executed. One of the nice things was th
at the interpreter sat right next to the 
witness, you weren™t separated by a gl
ass wall. There was no microphone or 
anything like this, and you had Œ could 
have conversations with him during the 
break. In addition to that, your work as 
a Œ an interpreter usually, maximally you 
could do this for Œ it was for about an hour
 and a half. It was fairly strenuous. And 
you would sit Œ either you™d s
it in the room itself, in the 
courtroom, or you would sit 
in a waiting room, and that™s where, usua
lly, the next witness was waiting with a 
guard . An d so you could sit there and ta
lk and Œ yeah, had some interesting 
conversations. I had Œ 
Kesselring
 once asked me, Field Marshall 
Kesselring
, he and 
I, we Œ we sat there waiting to go Œ go onst
age, and he wanted to  know wh ere I Œ 

well, first Œ first we Œ where I™d 
been, and I™d been , of course, in 
Italy
, and he had 
been in 
Italy
. No w, slightly  different positions ob
viously, but we discussed military 
strategy in 
Italy
 to the extent that I was able to. 
He then  wanted to
 know where I™d 
learned my  German, and I told him. And his 
reaction was, well, that must be a great 

satisfaction for you to be here. And I said
, it certainly is, Field Marshall. So, you 
know, some of these Œ 
Rundstedt 
once talked  Œ gave his te
stimony, and he talked 
for Œ we had Œ we had told 
him, look, I can take about four minutes, five minutes 

maximu m, but after that I can™t do any mo
re. And so he made a 10 minute speech, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
69
and then turned to me, and I sort of sh
rugged my shoulders. 
And I turned to the 
judge, who in turn said, we
ll, we can have the court reporter read it o ff, and then 
we™ll translate it from that. The court repor
ter said, I couldn™t follow him either, I 
was hoping the interpreter could. So we
 all turned back to Field Marshall 
Rundstedt
, 
who then  said Œ gave the exact same speech
, broken into two parts. It was amazing. 
This man Œ I mean, he Œ I wouldn™t say it 
was rehearsed, but he gave exactly the 
same thing all over again. So an yhow, so
 it was Œ there were some interesting 
experiences, the Œ the last head of the 
SA
 gave testimony about 
Crystal Night
. And 
actually, I prefer to call it pogrom of
 1938. And he was telling how the 
SA
 really was 
a, mo re or less a social organization whose 
main task was to protect Jewish l ives and 
property during Œ during
 this period, during 
Cry sta l Night
. 
Q: And his name? 
A: 
Miller
. Good German name. And he was 
Œ was going on, and then came the 
break and th en this man really was hiding
 behind the door wh en brains were handed 
out, because he turned  to me, and he says
, you speak ex cellent German. I say, thank 
you. And you have to  
be Œ you have to try to be neut
ral. I mean, you can™t, obviously 
your Œ your Œ your j
ob is to translate. Well, you spea
k ex cellent German, thank you. 
Where did you learn it? Or wh
en  did you learn it. So I to
ld him when. Where did you 
learn it? I says well, you know, I sort of l
earned it. Where did you learn it? I said, in 
Germany
. When  did you learn it? At that point I couldn™t take it any longer, I said, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997

up til 1939. Which of course was after the 
period Œ and he finally, I think the lights 
finally went on. This man had no idea. He ha d no idea what I Œ who I was, or what I 
was doing, or wh ere I had learned my  Germ
an or anything like th at. He just probed 
until I really couldn™t ev
ade the answer any more. But anyhow, so the Œ 
Q: This ma n™s name? 

A: His name was 
Miller
, he was Œ no, no, wait a minute now Œ 
Q: No Œ was it not 
Max Jüttner
? 
A: No, not ma Œ who? 
Jüttner
? Yeah, well, it-it-it may we
ll Œ in fact, a-as Œ I™m 
checking with my book.It must have been 
Max Jüttner
.
 
He was Œ he was the Œ the 
former head of the 
SA
 was 
Lutze
, who died in  1943 in  an automobile crash probably 
caused by a strafing attack, a
nd he sort of followed it. 
Q: How Œ you said you had to 
be neutral, that was part of
 your directions. Ho w could 
you be neutral after what
 you had been through? 
A: Well, your job was to translate, it was 
not to make, at that point not to make 
judgment. And you had to Œ 

Q: H-Ho w did you keep
 your distance then? 
A: Well, you Œ you concentr
ated on Œ on Œ on translati
ng and translating correctly, 
and that was difficult enough without making 
either sneers, sar casti c  comments,  or 
faces, or anything like th
at. You Œ you had to, I 
mean, there™s a certain 
professionalism involved an-and I don™t thi
nk you Œ well, I didn™t find that terribly 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
71
difficult. I mean, I may Œ might have had 
my own thoughts about it, but that was 
about the only time that I ev
er would reveal this to somebody who didn™t ask me. 
And even  he did, actually, in a way he did too, but Œ 
Q: Did you Œ did you ev er f
eel that you just had to release your anger at these 
people? 
A: No. Privately, to my Œ w
ithin me, yes, but certainly not
 that ti Œ no. But then Œ but 
then, you know, at that point
, they looked Œ th
ey looked Œ how should I say, I Œ an 
example was in 1940 Œ en
d of 1946, I went to 
Paris
 to see Œ to I Œ I Œ at that point I 
was already wo rking on th e subsequent tria
l Œ let me just digress a minute Œ and I 
went to see Œ went to  
Cherche-Midi
 prison, the French prison, which a numb er of 
German war criminals were being held, or
 potential. And I ha
d to get a deposition 
from two people. On e was General 
Stülpnagel
, who was the comm ander in 
Paris
 
from 1940 to  1942. He Œ there were two 
Stülpnagel
 gen-generals, 
Stülpnagel
; one 
of them was involved in  the Œ th e attack on 
Hitler
, this w as not the one. And I think 
the French eventually pr
obably  ev en let him go. The other was hama Œ 
Helmut 
Knochen
,
 
head of the 
SD
, who  was 
Klaus Barbie™s
 boss; probably one of the mo st 
hated men in 
France
; the man who implemented the Ni
ght and Fog decree, etcetera. 
Now I saw 
Helmut
 
Kn o ch e n
 before that, in 
Nuremberg
, and in 
Nuremberg
 it was 
very interesting because in 
Nuremberg
 the French prosecutor had a number of 
questions to ask him.
 And he would ask
 Kno chen
 and 
Knochen
, who, by the way, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
72
had it Œ a 
PhD 
in linguistics, would deny that he ev
er heard of this, and the French 
prosecuto r, man by the name of 
Monterey
(p h) would pick up a piece of paper and 
say well, is this your signa
tu re or not, and the man woul
d say yes. And he™d ask him 
another question,
 Knochen
 would deny it, 
Monterey
(ph) would hand him a 
document, says, is this your pre Œ piece th
e Œ is this your signatu
re? Yes. Well, after 
that it was almost like 
Pavlov™s
 dog, because all that 
Monterey
(ph) had to do is pick 
up a piece of paper and 
Knochen
 would ad mit everything. Well, when I got to 
Paris
, 
here was, in 
Cherche-Midi
 prison Œ 
Cherche-Midi
 Prison looks something like a Œ 
we sort of imagined French
 prisons to lo
ok in the 18
th
 century. You Œ when you 
knocked on the gate, somebody would come 
with a key about a foot long, and there 
wasn™t very much oil in th
e lock , and they  would open  it, and then you™d walk in, 
and then there™s a room full 
of French prison guard s an
d one of Œ couple of th em 
were getting haircuts, in another part they
 were Œ some were playing cards. And so 
you finally get to this guy, 
you get to the prosecutor™s o
ffice, and they  would bring in  
Helmut Kn ochen
. This was in 1946. Well, they™d
 given helm Œ it was cold, it was 
December. 
Helmut Œ
 they had given 
Helmut Knochen
 Œ they mu st have given him 
one shav ing Œ one razo r blade a month th ere,
 because he had a stubble beard. He had 
a French army overcoat that was about four si
zes too big. He looked pretty sad at that 
stage of the game, let me put it this way.
 He did not look like the sort of Aryan 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

73
superman, you know. So now 
many of the Œ you Œ you c
ould Œ you could Œ you had 
to maintain your distance.  
Q: Did you have to do a lot of research
 to do this kind of translating? 
A: Only on German military tr
ans Œ when I did the genera
l staff on Œ on things like 
military matters. And there was a certain am
o unt of it, and of course, the German 
language being wh at it is, where you can ta
ke any two wo rds and make a third word  
out of it, you were very ofte
n Œ and in my  case it was a lo
t easier th an in the main 
courtroom, where they  didn™t have time to
 think, but, you know,
 you Œ you Œ wh en Œ 
when a group like the 
SA
, the Stormtroopers were up, and a word  like 
wehrspo rt
 
comes in, 
wehr
 mean s defense, army, military. Sp
ort means sport, it™s things like 
hand grenade throwing, and fo
rced marches with packs. Th
ese were Œ these were like 
the Œ the military pentathlon in
 Œ in Œ in Œ in the Olympi
cs, these w ere semi Œ quasi 
military activities now. An
d then you were forced to make
 a translation of that into 
English, and the translation is extremely im
p o rtant. I mean, you 
translate as military 
sports, and they don™t like it, because Œ bu
t that™s what you co me up with. But th ere 
is no such word  in the English language. So
, you know, you try to prepare for it, but 

you never could for everything. I mean, yo
u would Œ you would be
 blindsided every 
now and then by some phrase. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

74
Q: Did you have any contact besides the 
Œ wi-with these witne
sses or defendants, 
besides the Œ the Œ th e two in cidents that 
you talked about? Did you have any other 
out Œ outside contact with them? 
A: Outside, or inside? I mean Œ 
Q: I mean, when they
 weren™t testifying. 
A: When they were not? No. 
No. No, the-th-they were Œ th
ey were locked
 up when Œ 
and I had no dealings in the prison itself. 
We did have one intere
sting case, and that 
was when  one man came up and that™s where I get s Œ blindsided  by the prosecutor 

who didn™t warn me in advance, because they asked him, do 
you know anything 
about the 
Gleiwit z
 radio station attack? Well, 
Gleiwitz Œ Gleiwitz
 radio station was 
a German radio station on Œ right on th e Po lis
h border, and just before the war broke 
out between 
Germany
 and 
Poland
, there was an attack  on this German radio station 
by Poles and 
Hitler
 gave it as one of the main reasons for attacking 
Poland
. And the 
witness, who was a member of the 
SD
, German counterintelligen
ce, said yes, I know 
something about it. Says, what do you know 
about it? Says, I was in charge. Well, no 
Œ there are times when you wish that the 
prosecutors would let you know something 

like that. They knew what 
was coming up, I had no id ea.
 I knew from history what 
the 
Gleiwitz
 radio station attack was, but you 
know, this was the first indication I 
ever got that it was Œ it Œ it was a German 
a Œ attack. I mean, you suspected it, but 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
75
you never suspected to meet the man that wa
s in charge of it. So, there Œ those times 
it™s difficult to keep a straight fa
ce, but you try, y
ou do your best.  
Q: Did you ever hear any testimony re
gardin g Jews and actions against Jews? 
A: Oh yeah, certainly with 
Dieter Œ Dieter Wisliceny
, as I say, who was 
Eichmann™s 
deputy. There were a number of them, but 
D-Dieter Wisliceny
 was the 
Œ the Œ was the Œ the mo st important one. 
Q: But then, what did he talk about? 
A: Pardon? 
Q: What were some of the 
things he talked about? 
A: Ah, th ere I have to go back to  my  notes. 
But they were talking 
about that the Œ the 
Œ the 
Wannsee 
Conference, of course, the protocol Œ I™m not sure whether the 

protocol at 
Wannsee 
Conference had been fo und by th
at time, or had been lo cated 
by that time. But he talked 
about that. At that point, 
Wisliceny
 knew exactly what 
was going on, the co urt knew th
at he knew, and so on. 
Q: And again, were you able to just k eep your emotional level down when  you 

would hear testimony ab out Jews? 

A: Yeah, you did. You have to. I mean, 
there™s a certain professionalism involved, 
you™re Œ you™re there for Œ to
 do a job and it™s up to the 
court to make the decision, 
and regard less of how you feel
, you have to  maintain your
 Œ oh, how should I say, 
equilibrium. You have to be straight a
nd translate it just as it was, you know. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
76
Q: Is your translation then, a part of th
e official records, part of the official 
testimony? 
A: Some of it is, some of it is what wa
s retain ed. The Œ the Œ there wa Œ it was a 
record made, of course, at that point, 
of the Œ four commissioners then made a 
recommendation to the main court, and some 
of those witnesses that we heard, were 
then heard in open court as well. Y eah. No, it is, but many more da Œ many more 

things Œ things that I did subsequently, th
e next Œ wo rk ing on the subsequent trial 
where I abstracted documents
 for future trials, and I 
still run across those in my 
research every now and then.  
Q: So you Œ you were work ing on th
e documents, and writing the abstract? 
A: Well, this was after I left Œ I left 
Nuremberg
 on the day Œ on th
e main date Œ the 
main defendants in the main tria
l were executed, and went to 
Berlin
 and then worked 
there as a junior research assistan t in 
Berlin
, in the 
Berlin
 document center, working 
on subsequent trials, on prep -preparing subs
equent trials. And there, of course, you 
tried to identify mater Œ at that point your
 job changed, you were
 no longer neutral, 
you were trying to help the prosecution 
to  the maximu m extent possible. And you 

identified documents, and wrote abstracts. 
Q: How Œ how did Œ what 
were your thoughts when
 these wit Œ when these 
defendants were executed? 
A: Oh gee, great. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

Q: Was it a cause for celebration? 
A: No, I wouldn™t say of cele
bration, no. No, it was, we
ll, fine. I mean, you Œ you 
had your own id eas about some of them, you 
were surprised at some  of the Œ the Œ 
the trial Œ the outcome, but no, I don™t Œ I wo
uldn™t call it celebration, but you Œ there 
was a certain degree of satisfactio n. 

Q: Did you sit on any of the 
Nuremberg 
Œ the court proceedings at 
Nuremberg
 Œ of 
the big Œ of the Œ 
A: The main court? 
Q: The main court. 

A: Yeah, I sat in the main 
court whenever I Œ whenever I wasn™t working myself, I 
would sit there and watch in the Œ in  th
e gallery, oh yes, oh, quite frequently. 

Q: And you felt justice was being done? 

A: Well, you wo ndered whether justice coul
d be done. I mean, how
 can you Œ what Œ 
what Œ what does justice mean? Justice me
ans that an appropriate sentence or 
decision, or something 
appropriate to what had transpir
ed, what they 
were guilty of, 
and that obviously wasn™t possible. But no, 
I recognize Œ I mean, the reason I went to 
Nuremberg
, I re Œ I recognize that this was something which history would, rightly  
or wrongly, or Œ either applau
d or not applaud, but would 
consider a major historical 
event, and there was Œ it was interesting being there.

Q: Are there any particular defendants that
 you Œ that Œ that you rememb er, anything 
specific of any of these particular people? 
A: No, I mean, I remember all of them Œ 
I mean, these were people whose name I 
had heard fo r a long time, and so
 with the possible exception of 
Fritsche
, who was 
the propag anda ministry de-d efendant, wh
o really didn™t belong in this group, 
because the people who did belong in this  group either were 
dead, or they were 
hiding out, masquerading as fa
rmers in the Bavarian moun
tains. He didn™t really 
belong, an d he™s the only person I hadn't  
really Œ couldn™t identify immediately as to 
who they were or what 
they were and so on. 
Q: What was it like to, again, live in 
Germany
? You were living in 
Nuremberg
, 
what was that like? 

A: Oh no, I was living in the Œ 
in an American or in Œ in 
a foreign co-cocoon there. It 
was not living in  
Germ any
, I mean Œ it was delightful, I mean, the thing I went back 
Œ we Œ you know, when , fo
r instance, I went to 
Freiburg
 or 
Nuremberg
, you know, 
you stood on the Œ on the Œ

parks, and there was a Œ especially one of
 the things, one of the Œ the acts was a 
comedian who was telling jokes about the wa
r, and half the audience was watching 
the stage, and th e other half was watching
 me. Well, I w as in an American uniform, 
what was he do Œ this was in 
Germany
, you know. So you di
d Œ you did have a 
certain amo unt of contact with local popula
tion, but it was on a totally different level, 
I mean you Œ you did not 
feel you™re home. There 
was no Œ no such  feeling 
whatsoever. 
Q: So th en you said you went to 
Berlin
, to the documentation center? 
A: Then I Œ then I went to 
Berlin
 to the documentation center, and I started Œ we 
started working, I remember, on the subseq
uent trial. And th e first one I think I 
started working on was the justice ministry
 trial. And after working on about three 
months from the Ministry of Justice, we
 discovered that hehad committed suicide 
two months earlier, but they had fo rgotten to
 tell us. So that was 
a waste of time. But

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Gerald  Schwab
. This is tape number three, side
 
A
, and you had said th
at you had arrived in 
Berlin
, to the documentation center. 
A: Yes, and Œ 
Q: Th-This is October 1946. 

A: October 1946, and for the next numbe
r of months, about six months, I was 
looking at documentation, at documents, abst
racting things for the 
use in some of the 

subsequent trials. This is where I came 
across, personally came across some of the 
devastating materials. I mean, there™s the 
Œ the register, I reme
mber distinctly the 
register from a Œ one of the Œ the German
 quote, hospitals, unquote, which were Œ 
were the mentally deficient or mentally 
ill people were killed, and I remember seeing 
the death register. This was in the case of 
the Œ I think it was the justice trial, where 
the head Œ at the top of the page it would 
list the name, and it would list the time of 
death, and then it would list the place of 
death, and the cause of death. And then  
under that you had a list of 
maybe 30 - 40 names, however 
long the register w as, and 
ditto marks under everything el
se. So everybody died at th
e same time, of the same 
heart failure. 

Q: Was this 
Hadamar
? Am I pronouncing it right? 
H-a-d-a-m-a-r

A: I don™t re Œ 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
81
Q: Hosp ital. 
A: I don™t remember w h ich Œ which institu
tion there was, but it was one of those 
things that, you know, they 
Œ they had to fill out a death register, and this was the 
way to do it. I mean, Germans were very 
precise and practical. Law requirement was 
to have a registry. And they had one, but 
they didn™t want to spend all that much 
trouble, to invent a new cause
 of death for each case, so they make ditto marks. They 

gave the name and then a ditto
 mark under it. This is where, as I say , so many of the 
Œ some devastating ma terials of that type 
were found. Orders which were signed by 
officials. O n e of the nice things the Ge
rmans did as far as the prosecution was 

concerned, was that every l
eading official had his own Œ 
had Œ had an initial. Well, 
those are very frequently difficult to deci pher. But what was nice, they all used 

different colors. So if you saw a blue initial,
 let™s say, in the Œ in the Ministry of 
Justice, you know ex actly who saw it, andif you saw a red one,
 you know who saw 
it. So it wasn™t just you Œ you could identif
y the individual, and we™re talking here at 
the top level obviously, at the sub-ministry 
level, and the sub-minister level. And this 
is where, in going th rough the Ministry 
of Justice files, I had an interesting 
experience, because having lived through 
Kristallnacht
, I decided this was a good 
time to look at some of the files having to do with 
Crystal Night
. And th e document 
center had a lot of German employees, who 
we would indicate from registers what 
documents we wanted , or what fold ers we 
Œ what fold ers we wanted, and they would

bring it. And one day this gentleman brough
t me some files, I started  getting some 
files having to do with Œ with 
Herschel Grynszpan 
and th e Œ the 
Crystal Night
 
events and afterwards. And he said to me, 
I see you™re interested
 in the events in 
Paris
 in 1938, and I said yes, I certainly was. 
And at that point I had in front of me a 
Œ the future Œ the trial schedule. The 
Germans had planned to put on trial 
Herschel 
Grynszpan
 after he had been turned over to th
e German authorities 
in 1941, after the 
fall of 
France
. And two of the witnesses were going 
to be memb ers of the germ Œ the 
embassy st aff in 
Paris
, namely Œ I mean, low level staff; one was a clerk who was at 
the front gate when
 he came in, when 
Grynszpan
 came in to Œ and the other was the 
clerk at the information desk who, in fact, took 
Herschel Grynszpan 
to see 
vom 
Rath
, the German third secretary who then Œ a
nd he subsequently  we
nt and shot him. 
And this, of course triggered, or was 
used as an excuse 
for the events of 
Crystal 
Night
. And I Œ the trial preparation called for th
ese two clerks to testify. I asked them 
whether he knew 
Amski
(ph) 
Hilfa
(ph), clerk so and so, and 
he says yes, I knew him 
quite well. I said, well, what about 
Amski
(ph) 
Hilfa
(ph) or clerk 
Nagorka
? He was 
the man who Œ to wh om 
Herschel Grynszpan
 said whom he wanted to see. This 
was a fairly  important bit of evidence b
ecause of some of the Œ th-the arguments 
being made whether or not 
vom Rath
 was the actual intended victim, or the 
accidental victim. And the clerk said well nag Œ clerk
 Nagorka
, that™s me. S o  that 
was a rather startling bit of information, 
but anyhow, he provided
 me the information 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
83
that I wanted. And th is was a Œ basically th
e beginning of the Œ the beginning of my  
research for a book which I finally 
finished about 40
 years later. 
Q: Well, I guess we can talk later about what
 kind of info rmation he gave to you. 
Well, what did he tell you at that point? 
A: Well, he confirmed Œ well, let Œ let me
 go back. The question 
was, did Œ at that 
point 
Grynszpan
 was asking Œ this was in 1942, 
after he had turn ed over to the 
Germans of ™41, he claimed that he shot 
vom Rath
 for personal reasons. And so the 
question was, the key question was, did 
Herschel Grynszpan 
ask for 
vom Rath
 in 
person, or did he just ask for a German 
clerk Œ a German officer. And the answer, 
according to 
Na go rka
 was, he asked to see an emba
ssy official. And this was a key 
bit of evidence. 

Q: We™ll talk some mo re about that later.
 What else did you do at the documentation 
center? 

A: Well, we spend all the time going through documents, every now and then  finding 
something of interest, iden
tifying, writing abstracts, and sending them on to Œ to  
Nuremberg
. The Œ some of them were Œ at that point in 
Nuremberg
, the medical 
trial was going on, but subseq
u Œ th ey were looking fo r 
materials for subsequent 
trials, the Ministry of Justice, an d variou
s other ministries. And you just sort of Œ 
either you were told, or you 
were given ad vice where to lo
ok, or you so rt of followed 
a hunch, or you followed so
mething, so Œ something foll
owed a trail which suddenly 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
84
opened up. By far and away the mo  Œ we
ll, almost the most
 interesting or 
comprehensive trail led to the 
Reich™s 
Chancellery, 
Hitler™s 
office. Because every 
time one minister wrote something to another 
minister, especially if they had a fight, 
they would send an Œ a copy to 
Hitler™s 
Secretary of the Chan
cellery. So there you 
would have both the letter being sent, a
nd the letter being coming back. I mean, 
when  a peop Œ person like the Minister 
of Post got mad Œ or the Minister of 
Agriculture got mad at the Minister of 
Post, and accused him Œ accused him of 
having an illegitimate child, he
 would send a copy to th
e chancellery and then the 
Ministry of Posts would then re-reply to th e 
Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty 
letter, and also send a copy 
to the chancellery. So th
at Œ there was a lot of 
information obtainable there.
 But mainly, you would stumble across something. Or, 
they would Œ somebody would iden tify a cert
ain event, and he Œ 
you would dig into 
it. 

Q: How did you get that kind of trai
ning, to do this kind of research? 
A: I have got no training whatso
ever. Let™s face it, I mean, the 
U.S.
 government™s 
just terribly short of people. So  you Œ yo
u got into it. You Œ 
you had a mo re than 
rudimentary knowledge of the German governme
nt by that time, an d you just sort of 
Œ there was no training for this sort of th
ing. I mean, you couldn™t afford to  have 
somebody sit there an d translate this stuff 
to Œ for somebody else to analyze it. I 
mean, some of it Œ obviously the Œ some of the people at 
Nuremberg
, some of the 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
85
prosecutors spoke no German
. So you translated releva
nt documents for them. But 
you know Œ 
Q: So you didn™t transl
ate everything you read? 
A: Oh heavens, no. You only trans Œ you 
made a judgment and you translated what 

was import Œ wh at you thought was important. But you know, as they say, in the land 

of blind. 

Q: So that was a big responsibility you ha
d going through that 
kind of information, 
and trying to  decide wh at was relevant.  

A: Yes. I mean, sometimes you would Œ y
ou had this supervisor whom you could 

ask. We had a Œ a former German, who is
 now a professor of political science at 
some college in the east coast, an d he was 
our supervisor. So y
ou could go to him, 
and Œ and say well, what
 do you think of this? 
Q: How big a group of Œ of translators 
or Œ or researchers were doing this? 
A: I don™t know how many people were doing 
that. I mean, we Œ we were a group, I 
would say th at I immediately wo
rk ed with about 10 people.  
Q: What other areas were
 you doing research in? 
A: Well, as I say, it Œ it Œ whatever the tr
ials, whatever subseque
nt trials, I mainly Œ 
we mainly did the Ministry of Justice, wh
ere, as I say, we found out after three 
months that two months earlier, our main 
defendant had committed 
suicide. But then

his deputy was still alive. 
Then you had the Œ you had 
the – I don™t remember. I 
don™t rememb er who. 
Q: Okay . When  
you were in 
Nuremberg
, did you see any of 
the well-known names, 
like 
Goering
, or Œ 

A: Oh yeah, of course, they were sitting in
 the courtroom, sure. Well, every time you 
went Œ I mean, they didn™t have mu ch of a 
choice, they were all 
there. You had Œ you 
had Œ you saw them, obviously , on the dock
. The only people I really got to know 
outside was 
Hoffmann
, who was 
Hitler™s
 personal photographe
r, whose daughter 
had married 
Baldur von Schirach
, the head of the 
Hitler
 youth, who was on the 
dock. And she often Œ so she was with her 
father often, and I had the opportunity, I 
had permission a Œ permission 
to carry a camera in the c
ourth ouse. And so I would 
often talk to him. 

Q: Is this a personal camera, or for Œ 

A: Yeah. Yes, personal camera. Came up, 
had qui Œ made quite a few photographs. 
Q: Do you still have
 those photographs? 
A: Oh yeah, sure. 

Q: Do th ese people look bigger th
an life, or less larger than life? 
A: Well, you saw them in the context that th
ey were Œ were there. I would say for the 
mo st part they were certainly not big in
 life any mo re. I mean, you knew that they 
were prisoners, you know th ey were on tria
l for their life. I would say the only one 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
87
who Œ whom you might Œ not larger than life, but Œ was 
Goering
, who Œ whose 
presence was Œ was Œ he wa Œ he was an 
imposing presence, let™s put it this way. 
Q: What was your reaction wh en you, let™
s say, heard he committed suicide? Were 
you angry, or Œ 
A: Too bad. I felt Œ 

Q: Too bad what? 

A: Œ that he cheated the Œ the hangman.
 No , I mean, it™s Œ it was not anything Œ it 
was Œ I Œ I Œ I sort of felt sorry for th
e prison staff, who Œ obv
iously somebody™s Œ 
somebody was going to  be blamed for it. No, 
not Œ no Œ I mean, how he went really 
wasn™t all that important to me. 
Q: Well, let™s jump back to 
Berlin
. Oh no, you had also said
 that you had seen Œ you 
had said that you had seen 
von Schirach
 when you were younger, and then  a second 
time in the dock. Did he look any different? 
A: Well, he was a lot closer the second tim
e, because the first tim
e, obviouslyhe had 
no Œ I mean, I wasn™t looking 
for trouble. I just saw him 
out of the Œ out Œ lo oking 
out of the apartment. And he was down at th
at Œ mu st have been about 1937 - ™38. At 
that time he was head Œ head of the 
Hitler
 youth. He subsequently then became 
Gauleiter 
of 
Vienna
, and so on, and it was in that capa
city that he ended up in Œ in 
Nuremberg
 and got 20 years. He was a lot closer then.  
Q: So how long 
did you stay in 
Berlin
? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
88
A: Well, I stayed in 
Berlin
 until about March, I guess, March or April 1947, and then 
decided it was go Œ time to go back, to quit. 
Q: What made you decide that? 
A: Well, I decided I coul
dn™t quite go on having only tw
o years of high school, it 
was time to go back to school. And of co urse, I came back about the time a great 
many 
G.I.s
 came back, or were back, and had 
decided with the Œ thanks to th e 
G.I.
 
bill. And so there was a great deal of co
mpetition for places in school, and American 
colleges, which of co urse the attendance expl
oded as a result of that. But I Œ so I Œ as 
I say, ninetee Œ early 1947, I figured I 
better go back, finish high school. Well, do 
something. And Œ 
Q: You had not had a high school degree? 
A: No, I had two years of high school, that 
was it. And then I applied to a couple of 
places, and I remember I applied to 
Rutg ers
 Univ ersity, and Œ 
but the one that I 
applied, that I finally went to, was th
e school which would admit me  without 
finishing high school; they didn™t care
, and that was the University of 
Chicago
. So in 
fall of 1947, thanks to th e 
G.I.
 bill, because without it I 
certainly would Œ oh, I™m 
certainly would have gone to 
Rutgers
, which was out of state college or university; I 
was off to 
Chicago
. And sp ent three years there. 
Q: And what did you study? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
89
A: Well, in 
Chicago
, the old days of 
Robert Maynard Hutchins
, you didn™t Œ they 
told you wh at you were going to study,
 you didn™t tell them. It wa Œ it was an 
interesting situation. They 
Œ you took 28 ou Œ battery of 
28 hours of tests, and then 
they said here are the courses you have to
 take, and when you finish these courses 
satisfactory, you get a 
B.A.
 degree. And I did, and in 1949, I got my  
B.A.
 Obviously 
I picked up something in betw
een. Then  spent a year taki
ng Œ well, let™s see, I spent 
one semester, after finishing th e college of the University of 
Chicag o
, I spen t one 
semester in  the School of Social Service 
Administration, and decided that that was 
not the appropriate career for me. I had noth
ing against the School of Social Service 
Administration, I just couldn™t quite see my se
lf working with some 
of the people that 
were taking courses with me, and then sw
itched back to political
 science, until the 
end of 1949 Œ ™47? No, no, 1950. 
And in 1950 th en decided to go to  
Stanfo rd 
Univ ersity in order to Œ I wanted  
to Œ to do so me research on the 
Gry n szp a n 
case 
and the 
Hoover
 Library of War and Peace had the best
 materials. S o  I went out there, 
and then spent a year there gradu Œ 

Q: Do-D oing research on that? 

A: No, no, no, I was 
Œ well, I got a second 
B.A.
 there.
 Stanfo rd
 University looked at 
my Œ the fact that it to ok me two years in 
Chicago
 to get a 
B.A.
, they were horrified 
enough th at I didn™t finish high school. 
But the fact that I only spent two years 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
90
getting my  
B.A.
, and to 
Stanfo rd
, in order Œ the way to  get your 
B.A.
 is to be in 
school for four years. So I got my second 
B.A.
 there, in political science. 
Q: And then ? 
A: Well, then something happ
en ed wh ich Œ you know, you h
ear these stories o n ly in 
America
, something that I still cons
ider amazing, and which I tell some of my f Œ 
my Œ especially my European acquaintances
 about. The State Department put out a 
call to all the colleges and universities for a 
special intern program
. Every school in 
the country was invited to pr
ovi Œ to designate somebody for an in tern program Œ or 
nominate somebody. And even tu
ally, in early Œ you™ll have
 to pass something called 
a 
JMA
, which was a Œ this was during the 
time of the Korean War, there was a 
freeze on federal hiring, except if you passed 
this exam. And you Œ the prerequisite 
was passing the 
JMA
. Well, to make a long story shor
t, out of th e 22 people picked 
by th e State Department, I was one of them, from 
Stanford
. And I still find this 
amazing, because there was certainly no need
 for this Œ the government agency at 
that point to pick so mebody wh o™d been in
 the country  only 10 years. It was ju Œ I 
just found it ab-absolutely amazing, beca
use it was a special program. And so we 
came together, there were 22 of us from all over the 
United Sta tes
. And that™s how I 
then entered my first job, State Department. 
Q: And your career after that? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
91
A: Oh well, let™s see. A fter that I joined
 the Foreign Service. I joined the State 
Department in 1951, joined the Foreign Serv
ice in 1955 Œ four Œ ™54 Œ no, ™55. 1955 
to 1957, I was assistan
t cultural officer in 
Vienna
, then back to 
Wa sh ing t on
 for two 
years, 1960 to ™62. The ama Œ new American embassy at 
Lomé Togo
. 
Lo mé
 at that 
point was so new that mo st of our mail went to 
Lima
, because nobody in the State 
Department mailroom really had heard of 
Lomé
. Then from 
Lomé
 back to 
Washin gton
 for two years. Then to eastern 
Nigeria
 for two years, which at that 
point was on the verg e of becoming 
Biafra
, just before the civil war. From there a 
year to 
Sierra Leone
. You ca Œ as you can see, I Œ I hit all the beauty sp Œ actually 
we di Œ we liked Œ we 
very much liked all of 
Africa
, with the exception of sieral Œ 
Sierra Leone
. I guess we got a little satiated at th
at point. From there, three years to 
Tunisia
. From 
Tunisia
 then a year and a half, almo st two years to 
Bangkok
,
 
Thailand
. Now, there was quite a switch. From 
Bangko k
, 
Thailand
 onto a year at 
Corn ell
 University for a sabbatical, where Œ I guess you call it a sabbatical. Then 
back to 
Washington 
from 1973 to 1976. And at that
 point I was sent to Œ I was 
detailed by the State Department to
 an organization in wh ich the 
United States
 at 
that point was not even  a memb er, namely  the International La
bor Organization in 
Geneva
, 
Switzerland
. We went there for one year 
and stayed 10, and retired in 
1986. 
Q: And when did you get married? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

92
A: Woop. Well, I got married wh
ile Œ in my last year in 
Chicago
. 
Q: And is your wife also from 
Euro pe
? 
A: Yes, she is from 
Berlin
, and I met her through some
body with whom I™m Œ I 
work ed in  
Berlin
. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit now about
 your book and yo
ur research on 
Grynszpan
 and 
what Œ what Œ again what inspired you 
in Œ in the course of your research. 
A: Well, it was an interesting case. I 
don™t Œ I don™t catcha Œ I Œ I Œ the book, 
eventually I named, ﬁ
The Day the Holocaust Began
,ﬂ because I do feel that the 
beginning of the Ho locaust, or Œ was with 
Cry sta l Night
. It was used by the Nazis as 
an excuse. But it was the begi
nning, it was the first time, 
really, with a couple of 
minor exceptions of centralized Œ centra
lly directed anti-Semitic, an ti-Jewish 
activities in  
Germany
. And wh ile there were obviousl
y earlier ones, like the boycott 
of nine Œ Ap ril 1933, the book burning of 
May 1, 1933, but after that it was really 
these Œ most of the things th
at happened were locally in
spired, or locally activated. 
This, the events, once they 
got going, and ev en though 
Cry sta l Night
 was not 
centrally directed in the normally accepte
d term of the word Œ the wo r Œ yeah Œ 
afterwards, it certainly was, and that was th
e beginning, to me, of the Holocaust. I Œ I 
found this young man Œ the story, of course
, is that some body, his parents Œ a young 
Polish Jew, living in 
Germa ny
, born in 
Germany
. His parents had lived in 
Germany
 since 1911, walked in to Œ heard Œ h
eard that his pare Œ he was living in

Paris
, heard that his parents had been
 shoved over the border into 
Poland
. In Œ in 
late October 1940 Œ no, ™38, 
they  sent him a postcard in 
Paris
, where he was living 
illegally with his uncle. He walked in
to the German emba
ssy, shot the third 
secretary. The third secretary, after having 
what to the ra Œ to those of us in the 
foreign service can only call a meteoric ri
se, within two days he became first 
secretary. But he died. And that was then 
the beginning of the events of Novemb er 
ninth to 10
th
, the night of the ninth - 10
th
 of Novemb er. He was held wi Œ in 
France
. 
Subsequently he said he had killed 
vom Ra th
 because of the pos
tcard he had gotten 
from his parents, and so on. He then was su
bsequently  turned  ov
er to the Germans. 
They  were going to  make a major propagan
da trial for Œ in which there were two

were going to try to prove that the shot of 
Paris
 1938 was the same as the shot of 
Sara jevo
 some 20 years earlier, in other word
s, that they had caused World War II. 
The Foreign Ministry was behi
nd it, they hav Œ had to ha
ve some excuse, they were 
desperately looking for 
an excuse for 
the outbreak of World War II. 
Q: So how did you 
do your research?  
A: Well, the research of course, I Œ I did a lot of it Œ I got a lot of it at Œ at Œ at 

Stanford
, materials. I got a lot of zer Œ not 
Xero x
, 
Photostat
 copies of documents in 
Berlin
. And then in th Œ read an  awful lot and research, got
 a lot of materials; for 
instance, as an 
example, the full 
Goebbels
 diary was at 
Stanford
, or the Œ the

Photosta t 
of the entire microfilm was Œ was at 
Stanfo rd
. Worked there, and over 
time, eventually actually, later on 
went to Œ met with his Œ with 
vom Rath™s 
brother, 
who was a lawyer in 
Wiesbaden
, when we were living in 
Geneva
. Did Œ fo und th e 
Frenchman who had done a great deal of 
wo rk on the same thing, and ex chan ged 
documents with him, and th is was basically
 how it wo rked. I mean you Œ it™s a never 
ending th ing. And actually I had my  first ch
ance to publish my work in 1952 or ™53, 
when somebody in 
Eng l and
 heard about it, and I was 
offered that they would 
publish it, and in  the State
 
Department, being a very junior 
officer at that stage of the 
game, I had to Œ at that time it was nece
ssary to submit manuscripts to a review 
committee. And after talking to these people,
 they said send it over, I sent it over to 
them. I had a document written. And about fo
ur weeks, five weeks later I get a call 
back saying this is a very
 interesting Œ we™ve just ma
de a couple of suggestions 
where we wouldn™t Œ since you™re now a 
member of the State Department, where it 
would not be totally approp
riate, but we™ve marked th
e place. Well, the document 
came back and it weighed about twice as mu
ch as it did before it went out because 
they put paper clips on all those places. We
ll, they had a paper clip almo st on every 
other page. And wh at had Œ 
had happened was that the 
French Foreign Minister, 
Georges Bo nn et
, at that point was go 
Œ who had been the Fren
ch Foreign Minister, 
he was going to testify for the Germans, or
 at least so the documentation said, was 
going to testify in this big trial against 
Herschel Grynszpan
. Well, by th is point, mi s

Œ 
Georges Bonnet
 had beco me Œ 1950s Œ 
Georges Bo nn et 
had become 
[indecipherable]
 to Franco-American Friendship So ciety, and it would just not do, 
saying th at he had collaborated with the Ge
rmans. And without it,
 the story wouldn™t 
have made quite as mu ch sense. So I put 
it away and kept it Œ kept it packed up for 
35 years. 
Q: And then  wh at prompted you to
 wer Œ t-to bring it out again? 
A: Well, when you Œ when  you work  and 
you Œ the people usually ask you what are 
you going to  do afterwards, 
you say you™ll write a book. And then  when  finally it 
comes you retire, you gotta put up or shut up. 

Q: Did you learn a tremendo
us amount by doing this re
search? Did you come to 
conclusions you didn™t think you™d be coming to? 

A: Yes, very definitely did. The biggest co nclusion Œ first of a
ll yes, you obvi Œ I 

obviously did a great deal of research into 
the era, into the life of the Polish Jews in 
Germany
. I mean, here™s Œ here are Œ here are people that came to 
Germany
 in 
1911. In 1938 they™re 
shoved across the border as Pole
s. You learn about why th ey 
were pushed across the border, and here you can
 attribute that to the actions of the 
Polish government as mu ch as
 to the German government. 
It™s a story that™s not too 
well known, but the fact of the matter is, 
it was Œ it was provoked
 by the Poles. But 
the biggest thing that I thin
k I learned is that to me 
Herschel Grynszpan
 to start 
with, was an assassin. I don™t like assassins,
 for any reason, regard less. And I was not 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
96
terribly favorably  well disposed  toward s him.
 I learned two th ings. One, befo re his 
probable death Œ in other wo
rds, we still don™t know ex ac
tly where he died, although 
we have a pretty good idea Œ this you
ng man, from becoming a young, hot-h eaded 
assassin, became a true hero. Secondly, whatever damage he did an Œ to Jews, which 
resulted in 
Crystal Night
, I think he saved many mo re lives, or his act saved many 
more lives than the Œ the Œ th
e death that he caused; for the very simp le reason that 
immigration of Jews from 
Germany
 and 
Austria
 started high in 1933, went down 
through 1937, early ™38, an
d then immediately after 
Crystal Night
, immigration shot 
up. So a lot mo re people left 
Germany
 as a result. So in the end, he really Œ his act 
really saved lives, even though 110 - 115 
people died  in the immediate aftermath of 
Crystal Night
.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Gerald  Schwab
. This is tape number three, side 
B
. The book, and th
e research on the 
Grynszpan 
case, and when  you did your 
research, did you interview his lawyer, or 
did you interview other people, and Œ and 
did you interview other people? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
97
A: I interviewed a number of people, I interviewed th e psychiatrist, the German 
psychiatrist who examined him on behalf
 of the German government. In fact, I 
visited him in a hospital in Œ in 
Berlin
. 
Q: His Œ his name? Okay. 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 there. 
Q: That™s okay. 

A: I interviewed his lawyer Œ 
Q: Did Œ did you learn anyt
hing from the psychiatrist? 
A: No, I got his medical opinion, which 
was reinforced by th e documentation we 
found. He found Œ he found 
him a sla Œ somewhat o Œ mo
re than average intelligent 
young man. Quite mature for his age, but at
 that point, of cour
se, he had been in 
German hands for quite a while
. I should say this, that 
he was treated very  well by 
the Germans, because he was a special pr
isoner, they wanted him for a big show 
trial. He Œ and while in pris
on he was allowed to keep  his 
hair. He usually worked in 
Œ worked in the kitchen on 
food distribution, which m
eans that wherever he was 
imprisoned, he had enough to eat. He was no
t, as far as I can tell, mistreated. And 
when  the trial finally opened, a decision 
finally was made to postpone the trial 
indefinitely. 
Hitler 
personally described him, or said 
that he was his personal charge. 
In other words that nothing was to 
happen to this 
young man without 
Hitler™s 
personal decision. Now, it probably Œ wh
ether it Œ whether it finally did happen, 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

98
happened with 
Hitler™s 
knowledge or not, a Œ chances 
are he died at the Œ towards 
the very end of the war. He su
rvived most of the war. But 
let™s see, we interviewed Œ 
or I interviewed 
vom Rath™s
 brother, I interviewed 
Moro-Giafferi
. 
Moro-Giafferi
 
was the French criminal 
lawyer who was hired by 
Do rothy Thompson
 and a 
journalist group to defend 
Herschel Grynszpan
. And him I saw in 
Paris 
in 1946 Œ 
40 Œ late Œ in December of 1946. 
Q: Did he give you an y insights? 
A: Oh yes, yes. He was, as far as I™m con
cerned, he cracked the case in Œ as to what 
the Œ the subsequent argument or this 
Œ the Œ what the Œ the argument that 
Grynszpan
 used to avoid a trial. 
Basically, what happened, 
Hersch el Grynszpan
 
avoided trial, or when the Germ
ans were all ready there to put 
Herschel Grynszpan 
on th e wo rld stage, on trial Œ for this they ha
d already invited, or were ready to invite 
the main newspaper people from 
around th-the Œ the neutral 
Europe
. They Œ it was a 
big to-do Œ was to be a bi
g propaganda trial. They 
had built a special courtroom 
[indecipherable] 
new telephone lines. It was 
to be a big to -do. And 
Herschel 
Grynszpan
 finally announced t Œ befo
re Œ shortly before the trial w as to take place, 
that he had killed 
vom Rath
 because 
vom Rath
 had made homosex ual advances to 
him. Now, obviously homosexu
ality is not what major propa
ganda trials are made of, 
especially if the victim was supposedly in
volved. Well, when  I finally did speak to 
hersh Œ to  
Moro-Giafferi 
in 
Paris
, he Œ by the way, he was 
a Œ a man about five foot 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
99
tall and five foot wide, who wh en I saw 
him the first time, greeted me with the 
statement that he had ever 
Œ only ever lost one man to
 the guillotine, and that was 
Bluebeard
, and Œ wh ich I said could be forg
iven. And he was the numb er one 
criminal lawyer in 
France
 in Œ in the 20
th
 century; certainly the first half of the fu Œ 
20
th
 centu ry , who had really been the lawy
er for just about 
every Œ every major 
criminal trial, especia
lly murder trials. Well, 
Moro-Giafferi 
smiled, laughed, and he 
says, well, let me explain wh ere he got that
 idea. He says, when I initially took up his 
defense Œ and he had been
 hired, as I said, by 
Doro thy Thompson
, who at that point 
was a majo r figure in American journalism, 
foreign co rrespondent in the days when  
foreign correspondents were still major fi
gures, in Œ in the days when you didn™t 
have instantaneous 
CNN
 coverage and so on. He said, I told Œ I asked 
Hersch el
 why 
he had killed 
vom Rath
, and he said, because had go
tten this postcard, and what 
happened  to  his parents. And I explained th at this matter Œ 
Moro-Giafferi 
speaking 
Œ I explained to him that French juries 
are not terribly friendly disposed towards 
political crimes. However, in a case of crim
es of passion, French juries are much 

mo re lenient. And since there had been  rumo
rs, which I have certainly not been able 
to confirm, that 
vom Ra th
 had homo sexual tendencies, a
nd had been rumo rs in town 
that he had visited homosexua
l places, he suggested that he may want to argue that 
there was a homosex ual connection be
tween the two. Well, according to  
Mo ro-
Giafferi
, 
Grynszpan 
rejected this out of hand. 
But then a few years later

remembered it, used it, and basically said 
to his cellmate, they™re not going to  make 
me Œ make another show trial out of me
, they™ve done enough damage already. 
Q: What did you Œ what di
d you want to accomplish by
 doing th is research and 
writing this book? 
A: Well, I just wanted to put it on paper, an
d put it in history. I don™t think it™s that 
terribly important, because if that hadn't
 happened, somethin
g else would have 
triggered wh at happened subseq uen
tly, where there would have been a 
Kristallnacht
, it probably would have happen ed 
differently. But I certainly don™t 
think that 
Herschel Grynszpan
 caused it; he was the excuse. And so I don™t 
consider this book as you know, that te
rribly important. It™s Œ to me it™s an 
interesting footnote to history. I don™t over Œ don™t wa
nt to overdramatize the 
importance of it. It™s Œ it™s an interestingŒ it™s a fascinating life, it™s an interesting 

individual, certainly the way he turned out 
to be. And as far he
 Œ he Œ I have th e 
utmo st respect for him,  and I felt his story needed to be told.  
Q: And is your book the 
definitive book on this? 
A: Until the next one comes out, yes.  
Q: Can we talk now about some general 
questions? Do  you th ink you™re a different 
person today because of 
what you went through 
as a young Œ young boy? 
A: Oh heavens, yes.  

Q: In what way? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
101
A: In every which way. I mean, you Œ you Œ 
you Œ you can™t help but be affected by 
these events. I mean, if I had had a 
normal childhood, if I™d had different 
acquaintances, yes, of course we™re all Œ we
™re all changed a great deal. I™ve no idea 
what we would have been like otherwise,
 but there™s no question. We™re mo re Œ I 

think mo re introspective. We Œ we have a di
fferent view of life, mo re serious view of 
life. No doubt about it. 

Q: You had said earlier that you lost part
 of your ch ildhood. Do
 you think you ev er 
got it back? 

A: No, I don™t think you can Œ there™s 
no way that you can 
get it back. And you 
know, it™s gone, but nerit Œ you Œ you Œ 
you Œ it Œ it Œ it affects you and it changes 
you and Œ and th en also, keep in  mind it™s 
not just what happens to you, it™s also 
what happens to the people who Œ that you 
associate with. For in
stance, the people 
that surround you. I mean, as an exampl
e, my  wife lost both her parents at 
Auschwitz
. Being associated with some Œ with
 these people, the more immediate 
victims, undoubtedly affects you. On th e other hand, at the same time, of course, you 

appreciate much more what you have. And I th
ink that™s of Œ that™s a positive side of 
it, that you Œ you are mu ch mo re appreciativ
e. You realize what life can be like and 
what life is like now. So there are both ne
gative and I guess, in a way, indirectly 
certain positive aspects to it. But change, 
a change that, for all of us, are Œ are 
profound. Or the Œ the Œ that the attitudes,
 or the Œ the Œ our feelings and so on. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
102
Q: You went through a difficult time when
 you had to  leave y
our parents and you 
were in 
Switzerland
, and you were by yourself with 
those two families. When your 
children became that same age, 
did that bring back that time 
to you? Is that a difficult 
time? 
A: Yes, it Œ it Œ it certainly Œ it certainly 
affects you, you certainly think about it. I 
remember sitting, of all the Œ of all th
e places, it really hit me when I saw ﬁ
Der 
Ring
,ﬂ 
Wagner™s Ring
, where 
Wotan
 leaves his daughter surrounded by a ring of 
fire. It really hit me right then and ther
e. So yes, there are Œ there are many times, 
and you try to guard  your ch ildren, of cour
se, from that sort of
 thing. One of the 
things I do when I do inscribe my
 book on the Ho
locaust, or, ﬁ
The Day the 
Holo caust Began
,ﬂ I usually write, may our childre
n never fully understand what is 
written in this Œ what is written here. So you try to protect them, but i-it undoubtedly 

affects your life, your attitude, your habits. 
The whole Œ your outlook on life, oh yes. 
Q: What kind of habits are affected? 
A: Well, I we Œ as I say, I would say mostly
 Œ habits maybe is not mo st Œ best word , 
but your Œ your Œ th e way 
you view life and the way yo
u live life and th e way you 
take it. The way you either appreciate it Œ a
ppreciate it, or the attitude that you have 
to life, it affects, i-it™s 
Œ it permeates everything. 
Q: Is it always on your mind? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
103
A: No, not necessarily. No, 
but it has shaped your mind,
 it has shaped your thought, 
and that is where the change
 then comes in. No, it™s not 
constantly on my mind. If it 
is I would be at Œ then it would be prim
arily negative. Bu t it has changed your mind, 
and that is where it comes in. 
Q: Are there any other s-sights or sounds
 that trigger your childhood experience? 

A: No. 

Q: You mentioned the opera. 
A: Yeah. Well, no, not really. It™s Œ it 
may very well actually, you know, you do 
think of it at ra Œ strangest times, of course. 
But to Œ to Œ you can™
t really describe it. 
It™s someth ing that happens. It™s not the sa
me thing that triggers it. But yes, it Œ it™s 
brought forth by all sorts of things, wh
ether it™s a Œ a book th at you read, a Œ a 
picture that you see, a Œ a Œ a story that 
you hear, all sorts of 
things can trigger. 
Because it Œ while it may not be
 foremost in your mind, it 
certainly is very close to 
the surface, it™s bound to be.  

Q: Did you join the foreign service Œ did th
at Œ did the inspiration to join the State 
Department Foreign Service come from, in
 any way, from your ex perience of being 
born in 
Germany
? 
A: I really don™t know, I don™t think so . I developed an  interest in international 

relations and Œ 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab

104
Q: What was that Œ what I meant was it Œ was that purely intellectual, or because you 
had seen tyranny firsthand, did it insp
ire you to  try to make a difference? 
A: No, na Œ na Œ I wo uldn™t Œ it can™t Œ I d
on™t think it™s possible I Œ my  case, to trace 
it to that, no. It™s Œ it was Œ it was an in
terest in Œ like intellectual interest and 
knowledge of Œ of European  history. And in
terest of Œ well, I mean, it™s Œ I Œ I Œ I 
don™t think Œ I haven™t really 
thought about this, I don™t think that it is traceable back 
to my experiences as a youngster. 
Q: If some one asked you Œ whom you me
t would ask you, are you German? What 
would you answer? 
A: No. Then  it come Œ then it depends wh
at Œ what the next question Œ no, the 
answer is no. I will, depending on the ques
tioner, respond and tell them what I am, or 
who I am. But I don™t Œ I cannot recall 
anybody Œ I mean, keep in  mind I™m Œ I™m 
fortunate. I don™t have a distinguish ed accent Œ 

Q: I just meant someone knew that you u
nderstood German, or in some way knew 
you had some kind 
of connection to 
Germany
. 
A: Well, it depended who it was, the an
swer would be no. I mean, basically, 

essentially, the answer is no. I do not feel 
German. I do not feel any special affinity 
for 
Germany
. I have no sp ecial affinity for 
Germany
, no. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
105
Q: Let™s now talk a little bit about the muse
um. I know you™ve done a lot of work in  
the historian™s office and so  forth. Could yo
u describe your first encounter with the 
mu seum, and when  you began work here, 
and how you learned about the mu seum. 
A: Well, I got involved with th
e museum when I went to see 
Sybil Milton
 in the 
historian™s office and wanted to  see what
 Œ whether I get any comments or a blurb 
for the back  page of th e bo
ok, and I™ve been paying fo r it ever since. I did get the 
blurb from 
Sybil
, and she made some very nice re
marks about it, but as I say, from 
that point on, I™ve bil Œ I™ve work
ed with th e historian™s office. 
Q: When  did you begin work ing there? 
A: Oh, th is mu st have been about eight years ago. It was Œ well, si Œ it mu st have 
been Œ well, when the b
ook was in its former 
state, so it mu st have been about ™89, so 
we™re talking ab out eight years. 
Q: And what kind of work  do you do here? 

A: Well, on the Days of Rememb rance book
, it depends. I haven™t right now, since 
there™s a change, I™m not working with th
em now, but we have been doing various 
things on the Days of Rememb rance book th
at™s on the chronology, for year by year 
chronology of what happened 
where. Then we have rece
ntly done some work in 
connection with the claims by 
American soldiers at Œ or
 Americans who are seeking 
restitution from 
Germany
 for incarceration in concentr
ation camps. And so there™s a 
question of definition, what is a concentr
ation camp, because it™s n o t always clear. 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
106
So we™ve been making Œ this is the Ju
stice Department, we™ve been helping the 
Justice Department on that. So th
ere™s a wide variety of things. 
Q: I-Is this something you™re doing no
w under the auspices of the museum? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And so what do you directly do? 

A: Well, right now I don™t. I mean, we finished
 that particular job. It™s usually either 
going Œ doing so me research and documen
tation in the library, writing up the 
materials. It depends which one you™re do
ing. I™m Œ I™ve done quite a bit of writing 

for them on these Day of Remembrance books 
that they put out every year. As I say, 
for a while there we were doing, in those 
books there™s a chronology, and Œ so you 
go back and try to find things that happene
d, or where th ey happened, during year 
X
 
and so on. 

Q: You said 
Sybil Milton
 had asked you to  start work
in g there, but really, why do 
you work there? 
A: Oh, I find it stimulating, I find it intere
sting, I find Œ I f Œ one
 of the things, of 
course, I appreciate there in that office, is 
that they have usually a numb er of young 
people, young Europeans; Ge
rman, Austrians, who are working there. For instance 
there™s some Austrians who 
work there in lieu of thei
r military service. And it™s 
interesting to be around them
, and to exchange ideas and se
e what they think, and so 
on. It™s a fa Œ I find it interesting, challengi
ng, I mean, I ge Œ I get a lot of intellectual

107
stimulation from my computer, but not 
that mu ch, you know, they can™t do 
everything. 

Q: What is the response of 
these young Austrian interns wh
en  they  hear your story? 
A: Oh we Œ I don™t normally tell my  story. 
It Œ it Œ there™s usually somebody needed 
around there who puts a little bit of balanc
e. And I mean, you have the, on the 
American side, you have, for the mo st part
, a number of people wh o know what was 
going on. Then you have thes
e young Œ relati vely younger 
people. And then they Œ 
the Œ there needs to be, or 
it™s helpful occasionally to  ha
ve somebody who either was 
there or was directly connecte
d, who can put a little
 bit, slightly different perspective 
on it. 
Q: So you feel you br
ing a special insight? 
A: Yes, I hope so.  
Q: Has working at the museum affected yo
u r memo rie s o f  wh at
 you went through? 
A: Well, it jogged it every now and then, 
yes, it certainly does. I me an, you come 
across documentations, or things certainly
, when you go back, you go back  and do 
research on stuff that Œ things that ha
ppened , or came out during the Œ during the 
Nuremberg
 trial, or Œ yes, it Œ it Œ it obviously  keep s it Œ it keeps it current, it keeps 
it alive. Yes, very much so. 

Q: You Œ you said a mo ment 
ago th at you do bring a spec
ial Œ you do bring special 
insights. Wh at Œ wh at Œ can you give us an ex ample? 

 
Interview with Gerald Schwab  
 
November 18, 1997 
 

 
 
108
A: Well, you can talk about the abstract Œ 
in the abstract about 
certain things going 
on. We™re Œreally we™re talking about the 
Nuremberg  
trials, an insider™s view. Not 
necessarily a Œ a Œ well, a Œ a sort of Œ a 
Œ a Œ well, a Œ how should  I say? An ide Œ 
whatever Œ well, I don™t Œ I Œ I Œ I really 
don™t know how to de
scribe it. Basically, 
what comes with actually having Œ having ex
perience that Œ or being around a lot of 
people wh o have experienced it. I 
think Œ I think it Œ of some help. 
Q: You can flesh out the picture a little more. 
A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: If you have friends, or Œ 
or have you encouraged  othe
r people or survivors to 
work at the museum? 
A: No, it™s Œ it™s ga Œ that™s a highly person
al sort of thing. I™v
e encouraged a lot of 
people to go there, both friends and acqua
intances. And I guess I think th ere are even 
Œ there are a couple of them th
at either are working there, 
or have in  the past worked 
there as a result. But I wouldn™t Œ I woul
d not want to recommend somebody to work  
there, if it d o esn™t come to them themselves
. It™s Œ it™s n o t the sort of place, I mean, 
that Œ I me an, it took me long time to take my  
wife there, for me to Œ for my  wife to 
go th ere. It depends Œ it depends on the indi
vidual. And it has to come out of them, I 
don™t think that it is nece Œ 
certainly somebody who is cl
osely involved with it, who 
has a personal experien ce and so  on, I™ve en
courag ed people to go to visit, but I

would Œ I would not encourage so mebody to 
work there if they 
didn™t get that idea 
on th eir own. 
Q: Do you have an
y kind of special re
lationship with other volunteers who are 
survivors? 

A: No. I Œ I don™t really have too mu ch 
of a contact with too many others, no. 
Q: Do you have any impr
essions of the mu seum™s non-survivor staff and non-
survivor volunteers? 
A: Well Œ 
Q: Both Jewish and non-Jewish. 

A: Well, let me say this way. I Œ I have th
e feeling that being Œ I n Œ I know there are 
a number of survivors Œ first of all, of cour
se, I have trouble with
 the word survivor. I 
do not consider myself a survivo
r. I know people who™ve been in 
Ló dz
; they™re 
survivors. Then of course then, I am not 
a survivor, I™m a Œ I™m a refugee, you can 
call any sort of thing, but survivor, I don™t 
feel I am. Then, of c ourse, then there™s the 
Œ the group in between, and that is, for 
instance, my  wife, who is out Œ who was 

never in a conce Œ went to Œ to 
Eng l and
 in a Œ in a children™s 
transport. Had a mu ch 
tougher time, and of course, mo st of all, 
lost her parents. Does
 she belong in the 
survivor cat Œ she doesn™t consid er herself to
 be a survivor. It™s 
Œ it™s very difficult, 
but to me, the Œ I don™t think th ere™s any qu
estion. To my wife™s cousin, who was in 
Lódz
, or was in Œ in 
Auschwitz
, no question either. It™s th
at in-between, gray area.

That™s one point. The second point is, I don™t 
think th at by virtue of being a surv ivor, 
you become an expert. No, quite frankly, 
I™ve Œ I™ve made myself very unpopular 
already. I mean, I™ve only attended one surv
ivor group so far, and I™ve made my self 
unpopular 
[indeciphera ble]
 by basically saying, just 
because somebody™s a survivor, 
they don Œ does not mean th
at they™re necessarily the best guides. So I™ve been 
accused since then of being an academic, or 
being too Œ too feelin
g that you have to 
have university degree and so 
on. Which isn™t, of course
, at all what I™m talking 
about. I™m just saying th at, being the be
 Œ being th e best guide, or a guide, it™s 
interesting to be able to say to a group, 
this person lived throug
h it, but that does not 
make that Œ that™s imp o rtant, but it doesn™t
 make necessarily a Œ a qualified guide, or 
the best guide. There might be somebody whohad no connection with it, and yet still 

is able to do a great job. So , I have a Œ perh
ap s a slightly different point of view  than 
some of my fellow volunteers.  

Q: Have you had any me
mo rable experiences working at the mu seum? 
A: No. 

Q: Are there any particular parts of the mu seum, the exhibits, that you identify with? 

A: No, I™m affected deeply 
by certain areas. Obviously, 
like some Œ everybody else 
be it the Œ the picture gallery, be it th-theŒ the shoes. I mean, you can™t help but be 

affected by. But not Œ it Œ it Œ it™s a Œ and 
I™m sure different things affect different

people, although there™s certa
in things like these, that 
abound ly
 affect just about 
everybody who™s Œ has any feeling wh atsoever. 
Q: Well, is there anything else you woul
d like to add before we conclude the 
interview? 

A: No, I think you have been very Œ this ha
s been rather exhaustive, and I don™t think 
I™ve ever talked quite as mu
ch as this in my life. 
Q: Well, thank you very mu ch fo r doing th e 
interview. This concludes the interview
