HANA FUCHS KRASA 
 September 10, 2003 
 
Q: Goodmorning,Hana. 
 

A: Goodmorning. 

 

Q: It™s lovely to see you again. Ha
na, what was your name  at birth? 
 

A: My name  was Hana Fuchsova, becaus
e the Czech have the o-v-a on the end. 
 

Q:  For t he -- for wo men. 

 

A: Forwo me n.  

 

Q: So your father™s name  was? 

 

A: OskarFuchs. 

 

Q: Fuchs. So your mother was also Fuchsova? 

 

A: Correct. 

 

Q: And where -- 

 
A: But my mot her was also born Krasova. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Her ma iden name  was Krasova. 

 

Q: So is there a relation? 

 

A: We haven™t found it yet, but th
-there will be some where back in the cent uries, because it 
was one clan. 
 

Q: Right. So your name  now is -- 

 

A: I shortened it to Krasa, soon as we emigra
ted from Czechoslovakia, I dr opped the o-v- a. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: Cause nowhere in the world it™s used. 

 

Q: Except-- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
2 
 
 
 
A: Except in Czechoslovaki a. 

 

Q: Czechoslovakia. And where were you born? 

 

A: I was born in Prague. I was bor
n in downtown Prague, at home . 
 

Q: Atho me? 

 

A: At home. And it™s a -- the hous
e is there standing because it 
used to be an old palace. 
After World Wa r I, there was a shortage of
 apartments, they converted some  of the 
palaces into apartments, and in one of the part
 -- palaces, we had an apartment. So it was 

very interesting and it™s still standi
ng there, it™s one of the old houses. 
 

Q: Now, I know you don™t like to give your birthda
te, but I™m going to ask you if you™ll give 
your birthdate, please? 
 

A: I™ll give it to you, because this is for pos
terity, and I™m not going to play around. I was 
born September 24, 1923. 
 

Q: Right. Now, I™d like to get an idea about 
your family, and how you were living, so tell me  
some thing about your father, and then your mo
ther. What wa s your father like, and what 
did he do for a living? 
 

A: My father was a disciplinarian. We  were very
 -- he was very strict with us. And he was a 
self ma n ma de. He came  from a poor fa mil
y. I don™t know exactly what my grandfather 
did. I knew his parent s, because both were livin
g at that time when I was up to about s -- 
when I was about six, my grandfather died. 
My grandma died in Terezín. So I knew her 
very well. And he grew up in a little town 
called Votice, in a t -- 
12 years, he went to 
Prague to go to a high school, to a -- that 
time it was called [indecipherable], which is for 
a s-scientist, like MIT or some thing like th
at. And from the age of 12, he was supporting 
himself, he paid for his studies
, all his schools were private, 
and he supported his parents. 
And when he that to us, we had never really a knowledge what it meant until we were 

much older, and understood what he must have 
been, to come from a little village to a big 
town, and no money, and take care of hi msel
f. Because he said always, ﬁYou have it 

easy, I pay your school, you don™t have to do 
anything.ﬂ Which was true. My mother on 
the o -- other hand, came from a very well-to-do 
fa mily, and the interesting thing is that I 
don™t have a wedding picture of my parents. 
They got ma rried in Prague, in a civil 
wedding, not a Jewish we dding. So I think she ju
st went and ma rried him, and ma ybe my 
grandfather was -- grandparents didn™t even 
know about it when they did it, because she 
came from a well-to-do family, my g -- father
 was from a poor fa mily. I don™t know, they 

never spoke about it. 
 

Q: So do you think that her fa mily didn™t approve? 

 

A: She didn™t have a mother, it was 
only her father at that time . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479

Q: Isee. 

 

A: But my aunt had a chur -- a synagogue 
wedding -- synagogue weddi
ng in Votice, so -- 
and had a party there.  
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: So I don™t know, my mo
ther was a little rebel -- 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- and very independent, and very 
ahead of her time s in everything.  
 

Q: Wer -- was your mother and father
 similar age, was there an -- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Therewas?  

 

A: Yes, three years difference, so that was a norma l age difference. My father  was three 
years younger -- ay -- older. My 
mother was three years younger. 
 

Q: So how would you describe their relationshi
p and their personality?  They sound like very 
different people. 
 
A: I think with our education in growing up, 
we were mostly guided by mothe r . Mother was 
the person who decided what we do, what we
 learn. For example, Mother was very -- 
decided from the first that I have to go to gimnasium, I have to study, because sh -- not 
every girl ma rries, and you have to be able to
 stand on your own feet. That was hers -- so 
that was very far ahead of those days. 
 

Q: Absolutely. 

 

A: And my father was concentrated on the prin
ce, on the heir, my brother, who was older 
than I was. He was studying with him, he wa
s checking what he learned -- ma th was very 
important, my father was an engineer. 
 

Q: So he was focused on your brother? 

 

A: More focused on my brother. 

 

Q: And your brother™s name? 

 

Q: My brother™s name  in Czech is Yearje, whic
h was pretty popular for that generation. In -- 
in English it™s George, translated. And as I 
say, they were very -- he was always very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
4 
 
 
pushing -- very much pushing my br other, 
how he studies. He wasn™t checking on me , 
but mother took care of that. And so my brot
her really jumpe d a grade. He  went from 
fourth grade already to gimnasium.  
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Where normally it was fifth grade, and that was good because in the end he  still coul d 
ma triculate with the last class, they ma tricul
ated before they closed schools in ™39. He  
ma triculated in June, ™39. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: He wouldn™t have if -- if 
he didn™t jump the grade.  
 

Q: So he was born in 1920? 

 

A: ™21. 

 

Q: In ™21, I tho
ught three years. 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: So, I see. 

 

A: No,no. 

 
Q: Okay. 
 

A: And-- 

 

Q: Were you jealous of the fact 
that your father focused on him?  
 

A: No, not really. Not really, because on th
e other hand, if we fought, or if we did 
some thing, he always got it, and not me . He was  the strong -- he was -- he was chubby, 

and I was skinny, and so I was the little girl
, the princess who nothing should be done to, 
and he -- he got it. If we did break 
some thing, he got it, not me. So -- 
 

Q: Were you -- 

 

A: -- w-we were not jealous of each othe
r, we had a very close relationship. 

 

Q: So you were close? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And did you play a lot together? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
5 
 
 
 
A: Yes. My -- my -- my br other was the 
older one, so he was schlepping me  along 
s o me t i me s .  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And I loved that, and -- and when we were 
older the girls liked me , because he was very 
good looking, and they tried to get near him. 
So I had good advantages of having an older 
brother -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- like my brother. 

 

Q: And what was the apartment like,
 since it was a -- i-inside of it -- 

 

A: It was very huge because the rooms were very big, but they di dn™t have the amenities that 
a modern apartment had, and we did move i-in fi
fth grade, when I went
 to fifth grade, we 

moved to a more moder n apartment, in differe
nt part of Prague. Th
is was near the old 
square, these were the old houses, and they di
d have running water 
but they didn™t have 
center heating or anything like 
that. You have the big stoves
 with tiles around them, and -
- but this was very comf ortable, it was big, 
and it -- it wasn™t bad. You had to walk up, 
and there were no elevators, you know, it was 
a old, old house. People still live in these 
houses in Prague today. 
 

Q: Really?  Wo uld you have been considered 
upper mi ddle class, mi ddle class, or up -- 
 

A: Upper mi ddle class, I think, yeah. 

 

Q: So you™re very comfortable? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber that anything was ever 
not given to us because there wouldn™t be 
enough or -- all it a -- had to be, wh-whether
 my father will allow it or not. And -- 
 

Q: Not whether -- 

 

A: -- we went on vacation, we traveled to Y
ugoslavi a. I mean, there was never question. But 
my mother was still frugal, she did not 
like to throw around m
oney, but I don™t think 
there was any problem with
 money all our lives.  
 

Q: And y -- you traveled on vacation oh -- oh -- 

 

A: Everyvacations. 

 

Q: Did you -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
6 
 
 
A: The next day after school we were for tw
o mont hs out of Prague, and my  father would 
come  on weekends, or spend the week with 
us, but we were with my mother, out the 
whole two months. 
 
Q: Really?  The two months?  A
nd what -- where would you be, li
ke would -- she would rent 
a house, or an apartment? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah. Th-Those were vi
llas where people rented part of it, or some thing. That wa s 
done not just us, all our fr iends were livi
ng the same  way, the company we had were 
living the same way. The girls 
-- not all the girls in school, 
because there were poor girls 
in school too, the -- were mi xed. But the friends
 we had, the Jewish friends all lived the 
same  way. 
 

Q: So did you often travel to the same  
place for those two months [indecipherable] 
 

A: For a few years we always did. I remember 
we -- there -- there were
 several places where 
we went in Czechoslovakia, then we were 
going to Austria for a couple years, or ma ybe 
three years. Then we went to Yugoslavia, a
nd then Hitler stop it. 
And it started with the 

Sudeten, and then th
ey didn™t go after. 
 

Q: Yeah,right. 

 

A: ™37 we were the last time on a vacation in
 Yugoslavia, and ™37 in
 -- in -- over Christmas 
we were in Vienna, 
and then it stopped. 
 

Q: So, in the -- 
 
A: We were every year in Vienna 
because my aunt lived in Vienna. 
 

Q: I see. And wh -- is there sort of a tr
adition for the more wea
lthy to leave Prague? 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Two months  seems like an awfully long time. 

 

A: Well, that was the school vacation. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: Yes. It was hot, and dusty, and it was the 
town so you were outside
, and that™s where we 
could play tennis and do things. 
 

Q: And what did your father do? 
 
A: My wa -- father was -- they called him director
, it™s th-the ravuss, the executive office, or 
whatever you call. There was a big factory 
called Odkolek. He didn™t stop there, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
7 
 
 
worked first with the [indecipherable] but I 
was too young at that time . That had about 80 
stores in Prague, that -- had a lot of employ
ees, big factory and -- outside of Prague. They 
had bread, they had chocolate, they had cakes
, they had all the -- it was some thing like 
General Mills, or some thing, you know, but they didn™t produce for others, only for their 
own shop. 
 

Q: For their own stores? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: So he was a big shot at that time  in oureyes, ma ybe there were some  bigger ones. We  did 
not own it, because the rich Jews owned th
e factories. This was owned by a board of 

directors. I mean it was -- what do you call? Th
ey had the shares of that, and they were 

mo -- a-all Jews. And the day 
Hitlercame, my fatherlost
 his job and -- and they ran 
away, most of them [sneezes] 
 

Q: Blessyou. 

 

A: Most of them e migrated to Canada
, the di -- the board of directors. 
 

Q: But your father stayed? 

 

A: Unfortunately. 

 
Q: Now, when you were growing up, what ki
nd of a kid were you?  Do you reme mber 
yourself as a kid? 
 
A: Well, I reme mber myself as spoiled brat, I -- 

 

Q: What do you mean when you say that? 

 

A: I could get out of my 
fat her anything I wanted. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: My m -- in my case my mother was the st
rict one. For example, we got our pocket 
money, and we had to manage our pock -- 
pocket money, but I wasn™t a good ma nager. 
I™d spend it in the beginning, and I didn™t have
 for the end of the 
week, and my brother 
wouldn™t lend me , because he said you shoul
d have ma naged better. And I would go to 
my father, and hug him and kiss him, and get 
some  money, so that 
my mother doesn™t 
know. And I knew how to handle him, even though he was very strict. 
 

Q: So even though he wasn™t focused on you because you weren™t the ma le heir -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
8 
 
 
A: He was there focus, but -- 
 

Q: He really was very focused on you. 

 

A: -- he was focused, it wa
sn™t that he didn™t care. 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: We wouldn™t dare to bring a bad ma rk fr
om school, because that was punishable, we 
wouldn™t get money, or some thi
ng. We were always trying to 
get -- because we had -- we 
felt we had to, I don™t know what would have happened if we didn™t. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I -- I reme mber one thing, I came home -- we we
re two -- this is more in the gimnasium, 
after the fir -- five grades. I came -- there was 
one more girl -- Jewish girl in the class, 
some  were ma ybe mi xe d, but they didn™t decl
are themselves, we were two Jewish, full 
Jewish girls in the class, a
nd she™s still living, she survived
 the camp. We ™ r e still friends, 
she lives in New Jersey. And we knew -- we 
-- the two of us knew Ger man, because my 
mother wanted us to learn languages, andI had to learn French and German. And I 

wasn™t allowed to learn English. And we kne
w perfect -- we spoke -- for us it was a 
spoken language, you still had to learn the gr
ammar, it™s the -- like in any language, but 
we could communicate and we could talk. And 
the teacher wa s very nasty to the two of 
us, so of course we said she™s an anti-Se m
ite. So I came home and I told my mother, ﬁI 
can™t do anything with this te
acher. She™s not going to give me  the right ma rk because 
she doesn™t like me  and Erika, we are -- becau
se we are Jewish.ﬂ A
nd my mother justput 
me  around, she says, ﬁI don™t care why she doe
sn™t like you. You™re going to find that 
ma ny peopl e don™t like you in life. You have to 
be so good that even if she doesn™t like 
you, she has to give you the good ma rk.ﬂ And th
at was it, I could never tell her that 
teacher is against me, or anything because 
it wouldn™t he lp. [indecipherabl e] perfect. 
 

Q: And what happened with that teacher, did you end -- 

 

A: We had to study, we went together and didn™t 
-- we  did try to be better than the others. 
 

Q: And were you? 

 

A: Well, I got my good ma rk. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: We couldn™t -- when we -- we lost he
r, you know, in -- every 
year they change. 
 

Q: Uh-huh,right. 

 

A: And that -- that™s -- my 
mother had no pity over me .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
9 
 
 
 
Q: But she taught you a good lesson. 

 

A: Yeah, in -- in [indecipherable]
 when we went into a store 
and we had to behave better, 
because people shouldn™t say the Jews are loud, or some thing, you know?  We  grew up 

with that, that we are different, and 
we have to behave
 differently, too. 
 

Q: Well tell me  about that. Yo-You -- were you 
living in a -- in a -- we
re -- going to school 
with Jews and with Christians? 
 

A: Yes. And -- and -- 

 

Q: You were?  And it was okay? 

 

A: -- we didn™t feel any anti-Semitism openly, never. But our parents made us aware that 
there are people li -- that won™t 
like us, and that we have to
 behave not to stand out. The 
Jews were always afraid not to stand out a
nd that was the difference from the Israelis, 
who don™t care what the other people think 
about you. The Jews were very caring what 
some body else will sa y about you. 
 

Q: So -- so there was a kind of fear -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: -- that even if you didn™t see some thing 
overt, it could happen if
 you weren™t careful. 
 
A: Ohyeah. 
 

Q: Were -- were you raised as
 a religious person, or not? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: No. We  celebrated Jewish holidays, ce
lebrated Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and 
Passover. Ha nukah we got gifts, but there was 
a little tree, because we had servants, we 
had ma ids, so for the ma id had to be tree. 
And if a ma id got a present, we got one too. 
But we celebrated Hanukah. When we didn™t ha
ve maids any more, we never had a tree. 
And otherwise we celebrated th
e Jewi sh holidays, but not th
e little ones, we  never knew 
Purim we ne ver knew, Shavuot, or Sukkot, or
 anything like that. We  kne w only the big 
ones. 
 

Q: And what were considered the big ones? 

 

A: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Pa ssover, Seder, one day. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
10 
 
 
Q: But no -- and -- 
 

A: Not the whole 10 days, we did o-
only two days we didn™t eat bread.  
 

Q: And Hanukah, you celebrated, 
but not as a big holiday? 
 

A: Hanukah we did, and not as a big holiday, we 
-- we lit the candles, and we got gifts, and 
that was it. Only one night we lit th
e candles, we didn™t do it every night. 
 

Q: I -- I want to go back to your being give
n pocket money. So you™re given pocket money 
every week, and what are you supposed to do -- 
what were you supposed to be doing with 
this money, what was it for? 
 

A: For our own pleasure, for if we want -- if we want to buy ourself some thing in school 
instead of the lunch Mother gave us. And if
 we wanted more than Mother thought it™s 
necessary for me  to have. I would have gifts.
 We  saved for gifts for Mother and Father. 
And we wouldn™t get special money for that, a
nd it was expected that we give some thing. 
So we got pocket money. 
 

Q: So if you we re s -- 

 

A: If you bought yourself some  ice cream -- 

 

Q: Or if you would go to -- 

 

A: My mother wanted us to be able to ha
ndle money, and since I reme mber -- I don™t know 
when it started -- I think, in my opinion, starte
d in sixth grade, because we  didn™t have  -- 
we didn™t have possibility buying lunches in fi
fth grade, in grad -- in grade schools. We 
went home for lunches. So I think it started in
 sixth grade, and we 
could have lunch fr om 
home , but I liked the lunches what the other 
[indecipherable] were 
buying. So that went 
for my money. By the time  sixth grade, we went
 to concerts, we went to the theater, we 
went to movies by ourselves. We  had to pay for it from our pocket money, which I spent 

[indecipherable] Sunday, some ti me s all.  
 

Q: And you would not have 
anything -- when would you get the money, by the way? 

 

A: EverySaturday. 

 

Q: EverySaturday. 

 

A: Every Saturday, and I only got it 
if my closet and my room was clean. 
 

Q: Ah. So you worked hard to keep your closet -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
11 
 
 
A: No, only five mi nutes before, I [indeciphera
ble] it up. Which my mother always said, 
that™s not [indecipherable], you™re to keep
 it all week, but [indecipherable], but she 
couldn™t change me. 
 
Q: But you know, it™s -- it™s interesting that you 
call yourself a spoiled br
at. It seems as if 
you™re spoiled in relationship to your father -- 
 

A: But-- 

 

Q: -- not in relationship to -- 

 

A: -- my mothe r  too. She made sure we played
 tennis, we -- we really had everything, you 
know?  Not -- I didn™t grow up like 
a girl that had to work, you know? 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I didn™t grow up without things. We  had toys. My father ma de me  a whol e furniture -- 
doll -- for dolls, which he hand carved from -- you know, he was very handy with his 

hands, he was a -- he was also very nice, a
nd draw beautifully, so we ne -- never got 
books to color, but he would ma ke pictures fo
r me to color, pictures of flowers, and I 
would color them. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: We really had a easy life.  

 
Q: Do you think that you we re selfish? 
 

A: I don™t think so, we were -- we were taught to
 share, and we shared 
with my brother, and 
I did my sharing with my friends. I don™t 
think I was ever selfish. Nobody was that I 
knew. Our house was very open, a lot of people 
came , mostly Mother™s family, my father 
didn™t have family. She was very close with 
her sister, that™s why 
we wen t  -- she spent 
vacation with on -- us, she™s [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- my aunt was like a second mother to me . 
And I spend vacation with her in Austria, she 
-- when I was rough -- five years old. And well,
 my parents were very giving, so I don™t 
think we were selfish, [ind
ecipherable] my brother.  
 

Q: Because of your characteriza
tion of you -- when some one calls themselves a spoiled br at, 
they™re often an extremely 
difficult person to be around. Bu
t your parents were teaching 
you discipline, and teaching you a certai
n kind of responsibility, and respect. 
 

A: Disciplinedefi nitel
y, discipline definite. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
12 
 
 
Q: Yes. 
 

A: You had to greet every time  you came, just stand there till you can 
greet them. We  had to 
had to sit at the tabl e and not talk, because
 that™s impolite. If you made a spot on the 
white tablecloth, that was an affair, you know?  
We were raised strictly in how we behave. 
 

Q: So in -- at dinner, there was no s -- talking. 

 

A: No, after dinner. 

 

Q: After dinner?  At the table, or 
you were [indecipherable] the table? 
 

A: At the table. What happened is my mother 
wanted my father and my brother to get close 
together. She found some old letters, and old 
stamps, so she brought them, and my father 

got interested in stamps. Old Austrian stam
ps since 1850, since stamps started to be -- 
and my brother, they -- and they were sit ting every night working on the stamps, and you 

couldn™t breathe, and you couldn™t move the 
table, and I hated it. And Mother knew we 
would do our knitting, our -- she taught me  cr
ochet, she taught me  to e mbroider. We  
would do our things like good Jews. We were al ways [indecipherable] together, we were 

not, as kids, allowed to go out at night. A
nd it was a rule, seven o™clock wa s dinner, so 
after dinner we had to do some thing. We ™d lis
ten to the radio. We  didn™t have anything. I 
reme mber working on those stamps, and that 
was their hobby. The stamps, a lot of them 

got saved, and my nephew has them. 
 

Q: Really? 

 
A: My brother™s -- my brother inherited them, 
because I never wanted to ha ve  anything to do 
with them, even after the war. And then my 
nephe w inherited them from my brother. So 
they still exist, and it™s a old, Austrian co
llection that supposedly 
is valued, I don™t know. 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: I have no idea about stamps. 

 

Q: Were your pare
nts affectionate? 
 

A: Yes, and we were a kissing fa mily, and ve
ry muc h so. That™s why we had to kiss every 
time you leave, every time  you ca me back. Bu
t we were a very affectionate family. 
 

Q: Right. What  did you like in school, wa s -- were  there particular s
ubjects that you were 
attracted to? 
 

A: Yes, history and geography, 
that is mine. Hated ma th.  

 

Q: Hated ma th. No wonder you were uncomfortable with the money. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479

A: And no wonder my father didn™t bother w
ith me , and ma  -- my brother was a ma th 
genius. 
 
Q: Yes? 

 

A: My brother was very bright. 
He spoke five languages, and he
 was really very bright. On 
him it was [indecipherable] 
 

Q: And was there some thing particular about hi
story that you liked, since history is -- wa s it 
history of Czechoslovakia? 
 

A: Yeah, the old Greek and Roma n history inte
rested me , loved that. All the stories about 
the gods, and things like that. 
 

Q: Did you want to study Greek? 

 

A: No, because I went into riyad gi mna s
ium where you don™t have Greek. You see the 
schools, are -- I didn™t tell you the [indeciphe
rable] gimnasium where there was Greek 
and Latin. The arr gi mnasium where they ke
pt only Latin. [indecipherable] in riyad, 

where they had the ma th and the sciences 
only, no Latin and no Greek. So from the riyad 
gimnasium where I went, you could go to both 
colleges, to the sciences, and to the 
university. But the others weren™
t geared directly. I don™t thi
nk it™s the same  today, I have 
no idea how it is -- things are 
there today. But you had to ma
de a test, right, where you 
can go. And the pressure was tremendous, and my
 brother ma de the test from the fourth 
grade, and he was young -- a year older, I went 
in fifth grade for that
 test, and I thought I 
will die if I don™t get i
n, because my mother wanted me  so strongly to st udy. But I did 
pass, and God, I cried when they read the name s in class, and I came out with tears, and I 

knew my motherthought I failed. 
 

Q: But you -- 

 

A: Because I was so nervous and so tense that 
I let go of [indecipherable]. And as a reward 
we went for ice cream. 
 

Q: And how old were you then? 

 

A: I was -- and in fifth grade. 

 

Q: So you were -- 

 

A: 10 and [indecipherable] 

 

Q: 10 - 11, 10 - 11 years old. 

 

A: That was end of [indecipherable], so I was 10. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
14 
 
 
Q: Right. So you really liked school, when you liked the subjects? 
 

A: I loved school -- 

 

Q: Yeah,yeah. 

 

A: When it came that I had to leave, I was deva
stated that I couldn™t 
study any more, that -- 
that was, for me  end of the world I wa nted --
 but then burns, my fath
er said, ﬁThis will -- 
war will be over soon [indeciphera
bl e].ﬂ You know, all this -- 
 

Q: Right, that™s what everybody thought 

 

A: -- six months and you™ll be home. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: We were saying even two months
, some  people, not six months.  

 

Q: We have to stop the tape -- 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: -- and change the tape. 

 

A: Okay.

Q: Hana, do you have any way of explaining w
hy your mother was so ahead of her time?  
For a woma n of her time to say you ma y not ge
t ma rried, so you have to be able to be 
independent, you have to be educated. It™s
 very unusual. Whe r e -- where do you think 
that came fr om? 
 

A: I don™t know. I think my mother, as I sai
d, was a little rebel of
 -- in her young days, 
because she told me  little stories, when she got
 punished. Her mother looked so strict  and 

severe. And she loved her parents, and I went to
 the cemetery every time with her to vi sit, 
and she alwa ys cried, so I knew she l
oved them, and she -- I thought, how could 
some body l ove grandma, who looked so strict and -- and she lost her mother when she 

was 20 years old, and had to take care of th
e whole -- my grandfather had a far -- big 

far m, with employees, and things like that, no
t a small where he was the farmer himself. 
And she had to handle all the me n, there had 
to be cooked for all the employees. And she 
has to take care -- I mean, she was 20. She al
so went to school -- not to a gimnasium,  
because they didn™t exist in villages, but to a sc
hool for girls, to -- they call it pensionnat, 
and they learn behavior, serving, cooking, 
and you know, some  subjects, too. Which was 
unusual, so ma ybe that™s where she got her 
independence. And I don™t think my father 
liked all that inva -- dependence sometimes b
ecause when she wanted for us to do it, and 
-- and do other things, my father didn™t want alwa
ys to do it, they mi ght have a little fight 
about it, but there were no 
serious fights, there were -- 
there were regular squabbles 
because we -- she wanted us to play tennis,
 and all -- swim and do things. My father 
didn™t think it™s important or should be, or 
the girls should do it, too, you know?  We  did 
all the sports from very early age. Mother fe
lt very important. You had to learn tennis, we 
loved it. We  had to learn skiing. She tried to
 ski with us, but she couldn™t keep up with 
us, and gave it up because she always had to be
 with us, my fa ther wouldn™t let us go -- 
 

Q: Withouther. 

 

A: -- without her. And we -- the swimming I starte
d at a very early age, and I did dancing, I 
did gymnastics, I pl ayed piano. We had all 
-- everything was because my mother wanted; 
to travel too. My mother wanted us to see 
foreign countries, and -- 
the only thing that I 
reme mber when I started to be little older,
 and I loved the Ame r ican movies, or s -- 
English movies, I wanted to learn Englis
h, and I was not allo
wed. English is for 
businessmen, not for young girls. 
 

Q: And this your mother said? 

 

A: Yes, I had to learn French. French is for gi
rls. So when I came  back in ™45, I imme diately 
started to learn English, caus
e I always wanted that.  
 

Q: And did you want it because you -- you thoughtyou wanted to come  to the United States, 
or just wanted -- 
 

A: No, I wanted it because I want
ed to understand those movies -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
16 
 
 
 
Q: Oh. 

 

A: -- I -- I l-liked the sound of 
the language, I didn™t like Fren
ch. Especially after ™38, I wa s 
hating the French, what they did to us. The 
British did it too, I di
dn™t know that. Silly. 
And I wanted to learn English, and I started 
in ™45, and by ™47 when 
I went to England, I 
spoke English. I was so di -- when I am deter mined, I do it. 
 

Q: That sounds like it. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And you loved the American movies more than the movies of
 other countries? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Wh- Why do you think? 

 

A: I don™t know, I admi red them. ﬁGone With 
The Wi nd,ﬂ ca me only after the war, and I 
ma ybe saw i t  10 times.  
 

Q: Really? 
 
A: I loved that movie. When
 I had to leave school, there 
was ﬁSnow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs,ﬂ on, and my father, as a -- to lessen the pain that I have -- 
they knew I -- I -- I 
was unhappy about leaving school, but there wa
s nothing they could do, and so he took 
me  to the movies for that, you know?  And that
 was the last time I was in the movies, 
because right afterwards it was 
forbidden to go to the movies. 
 

Q: To go to the movies. 

 

A: So I loved anything, we -- you know, it™s intere
sting, when we were little, when you went 
to a movie, there were -- we saw Charlie Ch
aplin movies, there was always the Fox news 
before, and then a cartoon. And all this wa
s in English, and I c
ouldn™t understand, I had 
to read. The reading wasn™t so easy when I was little, so I wanted to understand. I don™t 

know, ma ybe that was the reason. 
 

Q: And did you have favorites when -- how young were you when you went to the movies, 
five or six years old? 
 

A: Yeah, tha -- for the cartoons. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: We got them later than you do. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
17 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 

A: You know, they came to Europe later, ﬁPope
yeﬂ and all that. So we loved cartoons like 
the kids love today. Not the crazy on
es, but we liked the regular cartoons. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And they had special perfor mances for chil
dren, but once we went
 to school and had 
friends, we could go on our own to movies, and 
that™s when we had to pay for it. As long 
as we went with my father sun -- Sunday morning, we didn™t -- 
 

Q: He would pay. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: But if you went on your own -- 

 

A: But on -- later on my parents did not go with
 us, we -- we went to the national -- there 
was part of the school, it was -- they ma de 
student programs, and the student programs 

meant that you got cheap tickets from -- from 
-- as -- as long as you were a student. And I 
was only 10 years old, we  went on our own to 
concerts, on our own to the opera. And that 
was sun -- Sa turday afternoon, and that wa
s our program, Saturday after -- sun -- 
Saturday morning we wents there to school, Satu
rday afternoon we went to the theater, or 
to the concert. Sunday we went to the movies.  
 

Q: And that young you were going to opera and concerts? 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, because it wa s part of our schooling. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: As a matter of fact we had to sometimes write
 a report about it, that 
was expected of us to 
go and hear it.  
 

Q: And did you study opera in school? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: Nnn. 

 

Q: It simply -- this was just norma l?  This was -- 

 

A: This was norma l. One s ubject was music.
 So some ti me s you had singing, some ti me s you 
had history of music. Someti
me s you learned about the composers, mostly Czech -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
18 
 
 
mostly Czech music, and Mozart be cause Moza
rt was favorite of the Czechs because  he 
wrote in -- in park, he wrote -- got no
t -- you know, mostly the Czech composer.  
 
Q: So then how -- 

 

A: Rorchak, and Smetana, and Such, and the -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh. Right. And d-you -- d -- whose operas did you see, mainly? 

 

A: Mostly it was Rorchaks, and Smetana, b
ecause those were the popular operas. But we 
saw Tosca, we saw Carmen. I mean , we
 went whatever the program wa s. 
 

Q: And-- 

 

A: Much ma  -- my parents never went to a con cert with us, we went 
with my brother, and 
my friends. 
 

Q: Interesting. And did you sit in the back? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah -- 

 

Q: Because it was [indecipherable] 

 

A: -- we tried to save mone y, we -- 
we didn™t buy the expensive tickets, no. 
 

Q: Right. And when you went to -- 
 
A: There was a special student prices, too. 

 

Q: I was going to ask whethe
r  t h er e was speci al  pri c es. 
 

A: Yeah, and they™re right in the b
ack, we didn™t sit in the orchestra. 
 

Q: Right. And were there s -- concerts that you 
preferred? Did you prefer orchestra, did you 
prefer piano, violin -- 
 

A: Piano. 

 

Q: Piano. 

 

A: And then in Terezìn too, I used to go to 
Sommer-Herz, to listen to her all the time. 
 

Q: But you were playing piano 
all along, is that right? 
 

A: Yes, but I -- I -- neither my
 brother nor my -- nor me were 
very musical, I don™t think so. 
My father was -- had a tremendous e a r for mu
sic. But it was part of the education, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
19 
 
 
had to go through with it. And only when it was forbidden did I mi ss it, because I had to 
practice every day when I was 
little, half an hour, then la
ter an hour. And the watch wa s 
on the piano so that I don™t practice a mi nute l
onger. So it wasn™t in me , the music. It was 
only because I had to do it. 
 

Q: You had to do it. 

 

A: But again, when you lose it, then -- my brother 
to give up his violin, I 
-- they -- we had to 
take out the piano and give it up, it wa sn™t allo
wed, Jews to have. I wanted to play then, 
and then it was not possible. 
 

Q: Then you couldn™t, I see. 

 

A: But just to tell you how part 
-- and we were in Israel and 
we had very little, but when 
Danny, our oldest son wa s five years old, he ha
d to learn piano. I thought that™s an omen, 
that has to be. We  didn™t have a piano, we 
didn™t have a refrigerator, the first thing I 
bought was a piano for him.  
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: No refrigerator, icebox. No stove, just the 
kerosene, but the piano was in the house. And 
when we came to Boston, I bought a piano for 25 
dollars, that the kids can play piano. So 

th-that was what I was used to. 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 
A: [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Did you start trying to play again? 

 

A: Here and there, but I™m not good at. 

 

Q: You™re not good. 

 

A: I can still read notes, but I™m not 
good. I have never been really good. You had 
performa nces for the parents, you know, that hadrecitals that had to be
 so that the teacher 

shows what she did. But I was never good at that. 
 

Q: Did you like to perform?  

 

A: No. 

 

Q: You didn™t like to be in public? 

 

A: No. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
20 
 
 
Q: No. About anything? 
 

A: Ah, in dance I didn™t mi nd it. 

 

Q: Indance? 

 

A: In dance I didn™t mi nd it. In the gym -- gymna
stics I didn™t mi nd, cause 
I fe lt secure that I 
was good at sports, but musi
c, no, I wasn™t so good. 
 

Q: And were you doing mo dern dance, or you™re doing ballet? 

 

A: First I was doing gymna stics. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And that was with a German deutsche toonfur
ay. And then my mother didn™t want that I 
get muscles, because -- 
 

Q: What is a deutsche toonfuray? 

 

A: That was real German, German speaking gymnastics, and later on it was very 
[indecipherable] oriented, but I was there ve
ry early. And so she took me  out, and I did 
do dancing. Not ballet, but dancing, so there 
was more like -- not modern dances, it was 
like dancing, you know. 
 

Q: Was it at -- ballroom da ncing? 
 
A: No. 

 

Q: No, it wasn™t  that  either. 

 

A: No, it was like a ballet except 
dancing, you didn™t stand on your toes. 
 

Q: Toes. 

 

A: You were doing waltz or in group dancing 
the girls, and that™s what we had the 
performa nces. 
 

Q: Right. And y -- did you have a --
 one live-in ma id, or you had -- 
 

A: We had, when we were little, there we re 
a lot of people around, I 
don™t know. But we had 
a nanny that stayed faithful to us, and we 
loved her very dearly. After that she got 
ma rried, she would still come  and he lp Mother, 
but al -- we had later on only one lived-in 
-- live-in ma id. 
 

Q: But when you were younger, there we re
 a lot of people around doing things. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
21 
 
 
 
A: There were -- there were 
lot of people around that cook -- 
I don™t know where they lived 
all, I don™t know. We -- I reme mber only one 
live-in ma id, but they were comi ng in and 
out, and the nanny was there. We  loved her, so
 she took care of us. And s he was from the 

same  village where mother was. She brought he
r in -- into Prague. 
And she died shortly 
after the war. And she was the only one, wh
ere my parents le -- ta -- some money, and 
she imme diately said, ﬁI give
 you the money back.ﬂ So we said, ﬁNo, we divide it into 
three,ﬂ my brother, me  and her, because she 
didn™t have an easy 
life. The other people 
said, ﬁYour parents gave it to us, when they 
come  back we give it to them.ﬂ They never 
gave it to us. Even though we told th
em my parents are not comi ng back.  
 

Q: Right. I -- 

 

A: But she did. That was our nanny. But 
she died in ™40 s -- ™46, beginning. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: She was very sick when we came back.  

 

Q: Thingsstartchanging 
in ™38 and ™39, don™t they? 
 

A: It started really for us in ™38, when Hitler
 occupied Austria, anschluss. Because mother™s 
sister lived with her husband in Austria, and in
 June they mo ved to Prague. They were the 
ones who told us the horror stories about Je
ws washing -- I mean, being beaten in the 
streets, having to wash the paveme nt. But th
ey were not taken because they were still 
Czech citizens. So they didn™t touch them. A
nd t hey got an apartment near us, and that 
was the year [indecipherable] was very high. 
Czech screaming we will never give up, we 
will fight, be fore Munich. And that su mmer, there was a -- the Czech orga nization called 

Sokol was very patriotic, was all -- like a Ol
ympi ad. And all the schools took part in it, 
and then we ma rched through pr -- Pr ague. And 
I ma rched with my school, I took part in 
it with my school, my brother took part in 
it with his school. And we were all very 
chauvinistics, the Czechs were never -- we 
will fight, and -- the Germans, and we will 

never give up. And my uncle 
who came from Vienna, was al
ways like pouring cold water 
over us, and telling us today they scream 
we will never give  up, tomorrow they will 
scream heil Hitler. And he wa
s right. And then came ™38, September, and we did give  up. 
And from that time on -- my father did look 
into immi gration. Our 
life didn™t change until 

15
th
 of March, because my father still worke
d. I don™t know how he felt, whether he fe lt 
any anti-Semitism, but we have seen change
s in school. We still went to school, nothi ng 
changed, and -- but some  people weren™t so fr
iendly any more, and some  people stayed 

friendly. But it was a very uneasy -- the slogans
 were volt -- which rhymes in Czech, Volt 
number eight had again conquered noses, whic
h meant the Jewish noses. The typical Jew 
had a crooked nose, and so that™s -- was alwa
ys said, that™s Jewish. And the situation 
changed, you didn™t feel so safe any more. And -- but in 15
th
 of March, the day I will 
never forget, it was snowing, it was very raw. Wh ere we lived -- we move d from that 

[indecipherable] other d -- apartment. Jews 
did not -- there were no condominiums, you 
either owned a house, or an apartme nt. Hous
es to own, rent -- to own big apartment 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
22 
 
 
houses, you really had to be very rich, because
 you did not -- mort
gages were not like  
you buy a house today here in the United States. 
So we had a large apartment again, in -- 
on Benohuradi, which was a moder n, and much ni
cer part of Prague, 
more green there. 
And I went to school there in my fift h grade,
 and then I had to walk downtown to school. 
We didn™t use public transportation, we walked
 to school and home . And it started -- I -- 
across from our house was a German school. 
And the German school was imme diately 
occupied, 15
th
 of March by German s oldiers. They cam
e -- they -- at four o™clock in the 
morning, the telephone rang in our house, and my father picked up the telephone, it wa s 
some body from the factory, I don™t know who ca
lled, telling my father Hitler crosse d the 
border, Sudeten -- from Sudeten into Bohe mi a. Don™t come  to work any more. And that 

was the end of his work, 15
th
 of March. And whe n we woke up, the school was occupied 
across the street, and I saw 
the Hackenkreuz fa -- flags hung, and the German soldiers 
standing guard from my windows.
 And it was snowing, it was ve
ry cold and raw, and we 
didn™t go to school that day. 
 

Q: What kind of flags did you see? 

 

A: The German flags -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- with the -- 

 

Q: Theswastika. 

 

A: The swastika. And we stayed at the house 
all day. Also my pa re
nts decided to let the 
ma id go from now on, because my father wa
s without a job. So that was the whole 
change of our life. 
 

Q: Can I ask you some thing?  Your father
 is working in a Jewish business -- 
 

A: Not a Jewish business, this was a regular busin
ess, j-just a board of 
directors were Jewish. 
 

Q: WereJewish. 

 

A: But they were gone from that day on, too. 

 

Q: I see. So it was so fa
st nothing -- they just -- 
 

A: Maybe some of them ar e already left , I couldn™t tell you -- 

 

Q: Yes -- yes. 

 

A: -- before, you know, and some  other people 
bought the sto -- stoc
ks or things. I don™t 
know the financial -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
23 
 
 
Q: But they clearly knew what they were going to do, as soon as Hitler came in. 
 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Because they wanted to please the Ge rm
ans right away, there™s no Jew working here. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: It was imme diate. 

 

Q: So this is -- 

 

A: And a non-Jew stepped into my
 father™s positionimmediately. 

 

Q: Really? So this is extremely shoc
king, this is not a development -- 
 

A: I don™t know whether my father expected it 
or not. We  didn™t, we 
kids didn™t. I don™t 
know what was happening from ™38 in the job wi
th my father. But I know that we were -- 
my father tried to get out in a way. I don™
t know what all this happened. Cause we found 
a letter that a friend of his 
from Palestine had a job for him. And I know that my brother 
took some  Hebrew lessons, which, I didn™t know
 why. You know, we kids were not told 
anything. We were not told when some body was 
sick. As a ma tter of fac t  I could never 
forget that my parents never told me when
 my beloved grandpa 
died. I just found out 
when I came  to visit grandma and grandpa wa
s gone. We  were never told anything. They 
didn™t tell us what the financial situation is, wh
at --cause we lived -- we
 -- we didn™t f -- I 
didn™t feel we don™t money or some thing, you 
know, afterwards. We  lived in the same  
apartment. We didn™t have to move. We  had 
to give up -- later on we had to give up a 
room that was among the Jews and Jewish 
community to -- people lost apartments, 
because if they lived in a cer
tain part of Prague where the SS moved in, they wanted to 
have it clean of Jews, and they move d out. 
Some body else had to take them in. We  took 
in two women that were refugees from Aust
ria, two old women, they were only in their 

60™s. To me they seemed ancient. And then
 we had a -- when they were deported away, 
which was interesting, Mother told me  later,
 they had poison [indecipherable] and they 
said Hitler will not get them. But they said 
they -- they were going to Lódz -- they went 
in the fi rst five transpor ts -- they said we 
will never let him torture us, to Mother, but we 
won™t do it, because you have kids. So when you asked about the suicides, the German 

Jews had -- some  had poison [indecipherable] 
and the Austrian. We  did not, the Czechs, 
didn™t think about that ever. And then we ha
d another Austrian fa mily, a ma n and a wife, 
because when they left, we had to take so
me body else. That was not
 the German decision 
that the apartment was too big for a family. A
nd a friend of mi ne lived with us, too. It 
was the decision of the Jewish community, ag
reement. You know, they -- they had to 
take care of them -- their own people, 
nobody else would. And I think everyone complied 

gladly, we didn™t need that much room.

Q: So these two wome n who told 
your mother they had poison -- 
 
A: -- went to Lódz. 

 

Q: -- they said they wouldn™t do it. 

 

A: They wouldn™t do it. 

 

Q: -- at the -- in the house, yeah. 

 

A: They told her about it. That™s what my mother told me . 

 

Q: Hm,interesting. 

 

A: They left us a legacy, they used to own 
in -- in Vienna, a like 
bread and breakfast, or 
some thing, a pensionnat they call it, pensionne. And they had a cookbook from 1906, I 

still have that coo -- cookbook. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yeah. It™s falling apart,
 and I still bake from that cookbook. It™s in German. 
 

Q: And -- and they gave it to your m -- 

 

A :  T o  me  - -  my  mo t h e r  fo r  me .  

 
Q: -- mother. How sweet. 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Very sweet. So what was it like for you th
en? Is -- where is money comi ng from? How 
do you get food? 
 

A: I don™t know. 

 

Q: You don™t know. 

 

A: You don™t know, because the day Hitler came,
 you did go out that day, my mother went 
to the bank, wanted to take out her safe. A
nd they wouldn™t let her, the Czechs said no. 
The safe was gone. All what she had in thesafe was gone. I don™t know what my par e nts 

had in the safe. When, after the war I went th
ere, because I knew -- 
I used to go with my 
mother, I knew the number, and 
I knew the safe. I went ther
e, and the Czechs said the 
Germans took it all. And when we applied fo
r, in Germany for German [indecipherable] 
wrote about it, they said, ﬁGive us a proof 
that the Germans took it out of Czech Republic 
-- of Czechoslovakia.ﬂ So, that was gone. 
And the money was put imme diately under -- 
confiscated. Your savings, 
and your money. But every month you were allowed to take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
25 
 
 
out certain amount, so that I th
ink that™s how we lived afterwards. And then I worked -- I 
had to do some thing, so my -- I couldn™t go to school. So -- 
 

Q: Wait a second, from March 15
th
 of ™38 -- 
 

A: I still went to 
school till ™39 -- 
 

Q: School till f -- 

 

A: -- then they closed the universi ties, 
and they closed the gimnasium for the -- 

 

Q: In™39?  

 

A: [indecipherable]. I -- ™39 or some time during 
the 40 -- I don™t reme mber. I think it was in 
™39. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And then I had to do some thing, so my moth
er found a job for me  to do as apprentice for 
dressmaking. So I got little bit money, so 
I had little bit pocket money, and I gave some  
thana -- something to my  mother, I don™t know. It wasn™t much. And I had to do 

some thing, so I was working as a apprentice 
for s -- I hated every mi nute of it. I hated 
sewing, but as a reward, my 
father bought me  a new sewing machine, so that -- ma ybe 
that will interest me in it. That™s the same
, except it started mu ch later with me, where 
they felt a girl has to have a -- some thing, if she needs to earn money, and -- because they 

did think we will get out. Mother had some  re
lative in Chile, and we were supposed to 
go, but we kids were deadly against it, we
 didn™t want. The same  way I was in the 

kindertransport, because I wasn
™t 16 yet at that time . My 
brother was 16, he couldn™t go, 
and I threw such a tantrum that I won™t go 
alone. If he can™t go, I™m not going. So my 
mother took me out. And then 
I went alone to the camp. 
 

Q: But you would have gone if -- 

 

A: My brother would -- my  -- my brother would -- 

 

Q: -- your brother jor -- if your brot
her had gone, you would have been -- 
 

A: -- I would have gone, I just 
couldn™t bear to be alone. 
 

Q: -- alone. Now what -- why do you think your
 mo ther chose dressmaking? Was this 
because that™s what wome n did? 
 

A: I think the girls did 
dressmaking or hat ma king. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
26 
 
 
A: And she thought dresses are more -- more
 peop -- you know, hats you don™t change as 
much as dresses.  
 
Q: Asdresses.And 
what did your bro -- 
 

A: My friend, the one that went with to sc
hool with me , she went into hat dressing.  
 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: Hatma king[indecipherable] 

 

Q: Hatmaking. 

 

A: [indecipherable]. Some  learne
d to be a hairdresser or some thing. Some thing that women 
did those days. 
 

Q: So what was clear very quickly was that 
you had to learn to be able to do some thing 
[indecipherable] 
 

A: A trade, with your hands. 

 

Q: -- not some thing that was profe
ssional, in the intellectual sense. 
 

A: You couldn™t, your schools were closed to you. 

 

Q: Closed,right. 
 
A: University my brother went
, I think not even a month uni
versity, and they closed all 
universities.  
 

Q: So what did he do? 

 

A: He -- I think he got a job, some thing 
on the -- in the Jewish community, I don™t know 
what he was doing. [indecipherable] some
thing. Cause he had already matur -- 
ma triculation, he had all -- you know, in 
Europe, ma triculation was enough to do 

some thing -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- was not like here, that you have to have f
our years of college to be some thing, to -- to -
- 
 

Q: So he was 19 in 1939? 

 

A: He was 18. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
27 
 
 
Q: No, 18 in 1939, and in 1940 -- 
 

A: The high s -- the universities cl
osed definitely ™39. I think the -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- gimnasium closed a little later. 

 

Q: We have to change the tape.

Q: Did you have a problem with food when you were younger?   

 

A: I was spoiled in food. I didn™t eat anythi
ng. I was always very skinny, and my parent 
thought I was sick because I couldn™t gain we
ight. I was very healt
hy and I did a lot of 
sports and not sitting still a mi nute, so I di
dn™t gain, I could even [indecipherable] not like 
today, that™s [indecipherable]. And I didn™t -- 
I -- those days parent
 thought that you have 
to eat everything what if once you ge
t hungry, so that you don™t get hungry, eat 
everything. My mother tried, a
nd tr -- I wouldn™t. But when
 I went to camp by myself, I 
promised her I will eat everything. And that
 stayed with me , a nd I™ll tell you a funny 
story about it when we get to that. I was 
very choosy. So m -- I 
would get paid extra 
money if I put whipped cream on my dessert , or 
if I will eat another pi ece of cake, or --  
so I earned money extra.  
 

Q: But what ha -- what happens after the o
ccupation, and your father loses his job, but 
you™re not quite sure what™s happening -- 
 

A: Well, we didn™t have such special foods, we
 had mostly -- first of all, after all the 
restrictions, my mother had 
access removed from -- because there was a -- one stor e ve ry 
near us of [indecipherable] where my father 
-- and my father was loved by a lot of the 
employees. He was very good with them. 
There was a young woma n there who loved 
him too, and her boss, you know?  So she w
ould give Mother out more -- more of 
noodles, and more of flour, or things like that
, without tickets. Because Jews had diffe rent 

tickets, and my mo -- rations, and my moth
er could go shopping onl
y between three and 
five. And I don™t reme mber if it was ev
ery day or three times a week, Monday, 
Wednesday, Friday. I don™t know how, because
 I never went shopping, because Mother 
wou -- did all the shopping. So we didn™t -- we
 had some  friends w
ould bring an onion, 
Jews were not allowed to have vegetables, 
onions. There was a funny story. Fish we were 
not allowed to have, and my mother got 
from somebody a carp, and if you know about 
Heidricks [indecipherable] of hi -- the assa
ssination of Heidrick?  That day, some body 
gave Mother a carp, and she put it in the ba
thtub to have it for w
eekend. Tha -- this is 
[indecipherable] she was on [indecipherable].
 And that night Germans came to the house 
to search, to our house. And when they 
banged down on the door, we woke up, and my 
father right away knew it™s German, my mother 
threw dirty wa sh into the bathtub, so they 

didn™t see the carp. But of course
 the carp died. So we had to have it the next day -- the 
next -- the same  day. They were looking if
 we don™t hide the assassins. I me an -- you 
know, they just wanted to ma ke the Jews afraid, which they succeeded. 
 

Q: Right. Well, so -- let™s -- let™s talk a litt
le bit more specifically. There™s a -- ther e™s a 
series of restrictions that -- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- w -- could you tr-tr -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
29 
 
 
A: I tried to reme mber all of 
them, bec a use I think I was in --
 at that time ba -- home. Of 
course, the first was to wear the Jewish star
, and -- because I considered myself looking 
Jewish, I would be afraid not to. You ha
d to have it on your coat, and underneath. You 
got -- at the Jewish community you got a shee
t of stars, you cut them out, and you had to 
have it sewn on, not with pins, so that you can™t
 take it easily on and off. And that™s the 
one I have sewn by my mother, still on her dress. And -- 
 
Q: Does that mean if you took off your coat -- 

 

A: It had to be underneath. 

 

Q: It had to be -- yes, I see. So it always 
had to be visible, and 
it was on the left side? 
 

A: Always it did, on the left side. Then ca
me  when schools were forbidden, any schooling 
for the childr en. And in the beginning I still got some  schooling, a teacher -- a Jewish 

teacher after work, we could go and read
 some thing, books or  -- she had some  books 
from history, so I would go in, she talked 
about history. It really wasn™t schooling, we 
were just -- they thought to work the brai
n little bit. And I don
™t know whether my 
parents paid for it, what it wa
s, but I went with my friend to
 this s -- but second thing was 
that Jews have a -- eight o™cl
ock you have to be home . Jews
 were not allowed to be on 
the streets from eight to five unless they had a special perm
it. Jews had -- there was from 
the beginning, eight o™clock was Sperre, we 
called. And my father, 
being very concerned, 
we kids had to be home 7:30. And I always sa
id, ﬁYou are worse -- Hitler gives us eight, 

you give us 7:30.ﬂ We  were rebelling against 
that, but there was no way, so our friends to 
-- we went ho -- they walked us home and then they went home, because they could be 

eight o™clock, we were the only ones -- my br
other and me , we had to be home  7:30. You 
have to understand, by this time we
 are teenagers, so we want 
to be out little later. We  
couldn™t. That was the next thing. Then came that we were not allowed to go through 

park. So when I went downtown, or walking, we had to go around the parks. Nothing 

where green grew, you could go around. Then we were not allowed to go to the ma in 

squares. To the [indecipherable] like [indeciphe
rable] squares, the old squares, you had to 
go around, on the out squares. Then came you co
uldn™t go in the street car, only the last 
train, the last platform. And if it was full, it was your bad luck, you couldn™t get on, 

couldn™t get on, wait for the next one. We  
couldn™t go to any coffeehouses, because the 
Czechs were -- even the young one used to be 
-- would go for a coff
ee or dessert in the 
afternoon, walking, and then sit down for a coffee.
 That was fibil, no coffeehouses at all, 
no movies, no theater, no concerts, nothing. 
So what we did, like young people, we met 
in -- every Sa turday and Sunday with a gr
oup, in some body else™s house. And what was 
happening, these groups became very close. Y
ou couldn™t bring a friend unless everyone 
agreed. It wa s like a social club, you know
, because you couldn™t have it grow big, 
because only few people could come  to the house , cause if it was too ma ny it was seen by 

others and it could be considered that we are pl anning some
thing against the Germans, or 
-- so the groups had to be very small. I was in
 a very nice group and I have pictures when 
we put up plays and we put up plays with -- 
with our friend Rhode, and then we showed 

it to the parents, so we had some thing to do 
in the afternoon. At 7:30 
I had to be home. It 
was only for the afternoon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
30 
 
 
 
Q: So it was set -- it was eight o™clock, but for you 7:30, seven nights a week. 

 

A: 7:30, seven nights a week, 7:30 I had to be
 home. When we were young it was seven, and 
then it ca -- became 7:30. 
 

Q: 7:30, so it was a little better. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And what™s the -- 

 

A: And that was dinner, and we had to be
 together. Meals were
 always together. 
 

Q: Alwaystogether. 

 

A: And there was no excuse from meals. We 
had to be together, and if some thing was 
conflicting with it, we ha d to give it up, 
because my father wanted to see us. 
 

Q: So you couldn™t be invited to 
dinner to some one else™s house? 
 

A: [indecipherable] 

 

Q: Did you ever invite peop
le for dinner at your house? 
 

A: My parents did, but not my friends. 
 
Q: But not your friends. 

 

A: N-No. My parents had their 
friends. And when we were l
ittle we couldn™t have dinner 
with them, when we we re bigge
r, we could sit with them.  
 

Q: But be quiet. 

 

A: Bequiet. 

 

Q: What sort of plays? 

 

A: I don™t even reme mber -- 

 

Q: Did -- do you reme mber  

 

A: -- I have some pictures from it, a
nd I don™t even reme mber what they were. 
 

Q: Were you acting? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
31 
 
 
A: But -- we were acting. Our friend who died 
in Terezín afterwards
, very early, was the 
first one we lost, which was such a shock 
to us, he was 21, in 1943. And he was very 
intelligent, and very bright, an intellectual, and he wrote them, and he was so the --  the 
director, and he choosed who was doing what
. And that was fun to do because we had 
nothing to do the afternoon. We  would play, 
like we had a -- a record player, we would 
play music, we would do little dancing, but you ha
d to be careful not to ma ke noise so the 
neighbors don™t hear. You know, we had nothingto do muc h in the afternoons, except be 

in the apartment. Next week we went in so
me body else. So we tried -- so he tried to do, 
and then we had rehearsals for months, and mont hs, and months. And then one 

production the parents would come  and watch 
us do it, which was so childish I think 
today, but we  didn™t think so at that time . 
 

Q: Why were you meeting each other on Saturday and Sundays? Since you ha d no -- cause 
you were working during the day? 
 

A: Because during the week we were working -- 

 

Q: You were working. 

 

A: -- that was our free afternoon. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: And what would we do, you can™t go anywhe
re. You couldn™t even 
sit in a park. You 
couldn™t walk the streets, you couldn™t go shopping, you couldn™t do anything. I 

reme mber when we knew this will be forbi
dden, and we have to w
ear the star, with a 
friend I went to see this -- the castle, and 
go through the church there, which was such a 
famous part of Czech history, because we kne
w we won™t be able to do it any more. We 
couldn™t go to a museum, we couldn™t go to a church, to -- you know, one thing what we 

did too, which was interesting when you talk ab
out concerts, we went to church to s -- 

hear the ma s s, Bach, and all that as kids
. In the church were the concerts Sunday 
morning, we went to the church
 and listened. Music was very 
big part of our life, and I 
didn™t give it to my kids here as much. 
[indecipherable] kids, you don™t take them to 
concerts.  
 

Q: [inaudible] 

 

A: I did in Boston tried. On Wednesday morni
ng was at the Hatch, with Arthur Freeder -- 
Fiedler. 
 

Q: Arthur Fiedler, right, the Pops concerts, yeah. 

 

A: I took my son when he was five 
there. But he wasn™t interested. 

 

Q: It wasn™t interesting, no. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
32 
 
 
A: I don™t know how our parents ma de us intere
sted, what -- I don™t reme mber when they 
started us. So that I forgot, that we we
nt to churches, all that was forbidden. 
[indecipherable] were closed. You know, nothi
ng was working, so we met in the houses, 
that was the only -- 
 
Q: What was your mood?  This is a very depr
essing, oppr -- oppressive situation. Everything 
is -- 
 

A: We were very optimistic, even my fa --  

 

Q: Really? 

 

A: -- my father had a short wave radio. And 
Father listened to BBC, and to Voice of 
America, and to -- mostly the British one they had. 
 

Q: BBC?  

 

A: Yeah. And he would watch what the war is
 doing, and he was very optimi stic. Then we  
had to give up the radio. Bicycles had to be
 given -- my brother owned a bicycle, I never 
did because my mother wouldn™t let me ride
 a bike, I would have muscles on my legs, 
legs should be nice and smooth. So
 my brother, to give up his 
bicycle, what he did is he 

let out the air from the -- from the bike, and 
walked it, so that he ruined the wheels and 
everythi ng because he says he™s not going to
 give it in a good condition to the Germans. 
And the radio we didn™t give up either. From
 this non-Jewish friend, the father came and 
switched the radio, he had a very ordinary ra
dio, where he could cat
ch only one station. 
And my father gave him the short wave radio, 
and then he would come  and tell my father 
what™s happening at night, slip in under da
rkness. So the ordinary radio, the Germans did 
get. So you didn™t -- we didn™t -- 
were not allowed to have a 
telephone. All my life I -- we 
had a telephone, my father had, and we were 
not allowed to have it afterward. So they™d 
stripped us of everything, a
nd every time  we thought it™s th
e last thing. And another thing 
what the Germans did which was cruel, every Jewish holiday, some  laws came  up against 

the Jews. So when Jewish holidays like 
Rosh Hashanah was approaching, we were 

thinking, what will come  this time ?  What w
ill they take away this time? The jewelry?  
This is my mother™s ring. She always wore 
it so I never got another one from Edgar. So 
that™s her -- I don™t know whether 
it was her mo ther™s or whether my father gave it to her. 
But when I had it checked, th
ey said it™s 1900 cut. That 
she hid for me . But you know, it 
came slow. All these people sa
y why didn™t you ever -- 
weapons -- first thing was 
weapons. My father had his sword, cause he wa
s in the Austrian army, and had a revolver 
-- had a -- a handgun at home . So he
 had to give that up, that 
was the very first thing. So 
they stripped you slowly of a
ll your right, and before you knew it, you were like a slave, 

you had no rights at all. And you -- if you didn™
t step -- when the SS ma n walked on the 

paveme nt, when -- we had to step down into
 the gutter, whatever. We  we re not allowe d 
to be in the paveme nt when the SS walked by. 
 

Q: And how did the Gentile Czechs treat you? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
33 
 
 
A: Once Hitler came, except for one friend, a
ll dr opped me  like dead wood. One stayed 
faithful, I™m still with -- frie
nds with her. She™s the one ga
ve me  everything, she™s the one 
with the radio, and the first thi
ng she said to me , ﬁI have your
 father™s radio.ﬂ I said, ﬁI 
don™t want it, he gave it to 
your father, and you were so good to me , keep it.ﬂ She still has 
it. But the others dropped us, wouldn™
t talk to us, would turn away. 
 
Q: So they never said anything, they simply stared? 

 

A: No, they just dropped us. They were afraid to
 be seen with us. I [indecipherable] and they 
[indecipherable]. But this friend still came to visit. 
 

Q: Did that anger you or hurt you, or did you 
understand that they we
re afraid, and -- 
 

A: I wa -- I did understand, and I tried to c
onnect after the war, and the same thing 
happened. 
 

Q: They did the same  thing? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: I did the sa --  

 

Q: Youdid? 

 
A: -- I don™t know. I 
met with them through somebody I -- 
I didn™t know where they lived 
any more, I forgot the address [indecipherable]. 
We got in touch and the four of us that 
were very close in the gimnasium, met. Th
is was soon after the war, very early the 
summer of ™ 45. And I was devastated, I lost my
 parents. I had -- didn™t know what I will 
live off, I didn™t have a profession. I wa
sn™t that young that, you know, today you think 
they are grown-up at that age, I was really
 imma ture for that. And I didn™t know where I 
will be tomo rrow, and I had no roof over my head. And we me t, and we went into 
coffeehouse for coffee. And they talked about 
boys and dances, and 
dresses, and I don™t 
know what. And they were not interested in me
 at all, and I had not
hing to contribute to 
the conversation. We  said good-byes, and I 
never saw them a gain [indecipherable]  
 

Q: So they never asked you what happened. They didn™t -- 

 

A: No. When you wanted to say some thing you we
re told, ﬁDon™t talk a
bout it, that™s gone, 
we survived, it™s finished. Don™t think about it
 at all.ﬂ So that wa
s the end. I don™t know 
where they are, or whether they live, or 
nothing, e-except that one
 friend that I kept. 
 

Q: So you -- you™re saying that you rema ined 
optimistic, in spite of
 all of this -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
34 
 
 
A: Always optimistic in spite -- my father wa
s so optimistic. I don™t know whether he did it 
for us, or whether he  was -- first of all, 
he thought Hitler won™t do to the Czech Jews 
what he did to the German Jews. And we al
ways felt we are differe
nt. We are -- we are 
not like the Polish Jews that wore -- you know
, the Hassidic. We were dressed normally. 
They always considered themselves different
. And then we thought, he can™t do, we are a 
protectorate, we are not Germany, he won™
t do the same  thing. And once -- special in 
1941, when America went into war after Pearl Ha
rbor, we celebrated, this is the end of 
the war. People said the next day will be 
end of the war, the America will just bomb 
Germany, a nd that will be the end. The German
s won™t get up any more . It didn™t work 
that way. 
 
Q: And you alone, with your friends 
that would meet 
every week -- 
 

A: We were very optimistic. 

 

Q: You™re very optimistic, you didn™t sit 
there and say, oh my God, what™s happening? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Really? That ™s very --  

 

A: Until --  until ™41 when the transpor ts 
started. That was a wake up call that ma ybe 
everythi ng will not be --  fi rst of all, in th
e fi rst five transpor ts, which went to Lódz, 
[indecipherable] the friends went already. A
nd then in ™41 in Nove mber, when -- they 
opened Terezín, a lot of friends
 went. And my boyfriend we
nt, and that™s a funny story 
about too, cause that™s wa -- how I got to 
Terezín by myself. And that started, and my 
father had me to be always ready on time. 
Start -- my mother started to preparing for 

deportation. We had our 50 [ind
ecipherable] everyone had what -- what we didn™t wear, 
what do you take with us. My mother wanted
 everything to be like so, in condition like 

new, so we wore the other things. My mother
 would e-eggs we re a very hard com -- well, 
you know, commodity. Jews were not allowed to
 -- we didn™t have it in rations, but my 
mother got some  on black ma rk
et from that lady that was 
her savior, and she would dry 
egg whites, use only the yolks, here and ther
e, and if you mi x the 
dried egg whites with 
water, you had eggs, you know, egg white. So 
sh -- and that didn™t weigh much, so we 
got all a bag prepared of egg whites to 
take with us, and she would bake gim -- 
 

Q: How do you da -- how do you dry eggs? 

 

A: On a plate, and -- and she let it dr y until it got hard like crystal. 

 

Q: Oh my.  

 

A: And she would bake special gingerbread that
 was very hard, but could all -- never got 
moldy. She ma de for us what we called a stude
nmix, al monds, nuts, raisins that she still 
had, and if she had a -- some thing to put
 in [indecipherable] and that -- that 
[indecipherable] and that she ma de a bi -- see,
 this is all the food 
that [indecipherable]

took with us, or we wouldn™t touch it a
ny more since ™41, that was prepared for 
deportation. 
 
Q: So you were always ready to go? 

 

A: My father -- I don™t think other people did 
it, but my father had to be ready. And my 
father ma de another thing, he handy with wood, he ma de mi r r ors for each of us, and put 

money in it. And these mirrors we took with us. 
 

Q: So that there was a wooden backing -- 

 

A: Wooden back and a -- and a mi rror, and in 
between was a hollow, and there he put the 
money. They took it each to th -- Auschwitz, 
and I had mi ne to the end, and my brother 
took it to Auschwitz, and I had mi ne till the end, but when I took it out, marks were 

nothing, just a piece of pa per, because 
they were German ma r ks, and -- 
 

Q: And it was worthless. When -- when German
y attacked the Soviet Union, did that make 
you nervous, or you still thought so
me one™s gonna come  in and -- 
 

A: We -- we still though
t that the 
British --  
 

Q: I mean Poland, not the Soviet Union 

 

A: -- then German, that was the beginning of the war. 

 

Q: Right,right. 
 
A: We knew one thing, that Hitler will not give
 up Czechoslova ki a unless there is a war, we 
wanted that war. 
 

Q: Yeah, I see. So you needed some thing, 
because it was the only way to get a -- 

 

A: And the same thing happened to me  when 
-- the Communists, who I never believed that 
Communists will fall without a war. I said, ther
e has to be a third World War to get the 
Russian Soviets down. Because that™s what we
 believe d, the Germans wi ll not gi ve up on 
their own. They will neve r move back. But 
of course, we saw Britain will comi ng, and 
we -- the biggest depression I think what 
happened was when France fell. Poland, let 
them take care -- Russia will take care of it. But when France fell, that  was very 

depressi ng, cause we thought they will move fo
rward. And then they did the same  thing 
in World War I, and the Czechs were saying 
French are good lovers, but lousy soldiers. 
They give up, you know?  But then the Czech
s ga ve up too, finally. And the biggest 
exciteme nt was when there was invasion, when 
we thought that™s the end of the war right 
then and there, that the Americans -- 
 

Q: [indecipherable] 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
36 
 
 
A: -- will -- will walk through Germany. Didn™t think Germans are that  strong, still -- 
 

Q: So you -- 

 

A: -- to put up the fight me  -- but 
I think we just closed our eyes. 
 

Q: Right. So you really didn™t 
have a sense of what the condi
tions of all these countries 
were. What the economic --  
 

A: Not the condition, not the conditi
on. We  thought they are strong -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- and they will take care of Ger many. 
And we thought Germany -- Germans are weak. 
We thought they don™t have reserves. They had --
 didn™t have oil, they didn™t have rubber 
for the wheels. I didn™t -- 
they didn™t have anything, but
 they ma de what they had. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: They could recycle, which, you know, kept th
em -- and the worst thing was that from the 
Jewish money, and gold, and art, they supporte
d the war. The -- the -- the Jews paid for 
the war. 
 

Q: From what they confiscated. 

 

A: What they took from the Jews, they paid for the war. 
 
Q: Isee. 

 

A: They had the money, the Jews in Swit
zerland, they supported them. But you didn™t know 
that time, but the Jews supported the war. A
nd we thought they were 
run out of ma terial, 
they wouldn™t have 
enough to fight with. 
 

Q: So when they -- 

 

A: My father had some connections in --  in
 -- in Terezín that he got news. What the 
moveme nt of the front is, he knew. But by that
 time he wasn™t that optimistic, because the 
interest -- the Altestenra
t, I think he  knew also what™s happening, because he -- the things 
he told me  when we left, and I couldn™t go with
 -- they did not want me  to -- to volunteer, 
and I did, and it didn™t help. But what he 
said is, ﬁ We had our life behind, we are old. 
You have to survive. You have to do everyt hing to survive. Don™t worry about us.ﬂ He 

[indecipherable] so he went to Russia. He
 didn™t go to Russia, which I didn™t know. 
 

Q: Right. So he knew some thing. 

 

A: Heknew. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
37 
 
 
 
Q: He knew some thing. So between ™39, when -- Germany attacks Poland. And then there™s 
a pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. 
And then they violate the pact, and they 
attack the Soviet Union. 
 

A: That was no surprise to us, because we 
didn™t trust the Russians anyhow. They -- you 
know, we ju -- when they ma de the pact with th
e Nazi -- the right a
nd the left, they were 
ma ke a pact, that™s just [indecipherable]. I 
don™t think anybody believed that Stalin tells 
the truth.  
 

Q: And were you hearing things
 about what was going on in Po
land, before the beginning of 
Terezín? 

 
A: Yeah, we were, but you know, people alwa
ys think things are exaggerated. And it 
happened there, it is not happening here. 
Do you know how today people think, happens 
to the others, it won™t happen to me . 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I think that™s what we thought. I thin
k that was what we 
were hiding behind. 
 

Q: Now, did you know a lot of people whotried to leave, or actually left? 

 

A: Yes, yes, we knew people who tried to l
eave, we knew people who left. My aunt was 
supposed to go. They had a f -- fo America, and they were supposed to go to Cuba 

because they had to wait, and she just wouldn™
t leave. They already ha d their tickets, and 
everything, and she wouldn™t leave withou -- 
without us, you know, and my mother, and 
they stayed, and it was -- well, they died. A
nd we were supposed to leave for Chile, and 

then I don™t know why my parent
s decided not to. And my fa
ther didn™t want to go to 
Palestine, that was open to us. I don™t know what was happening around then, because 

not much was shared. We -- more was shared
 with my brother, my brother knew more 
than I di d, because he wa s little older.  
 

Q: I was going to say, was it because he was a boy -- 

 

A: And he was also longer with my parents, 
he went to Terezín with
 my friends, I went by 
myself. 
 

Q: [indecipherable]yeah.We
 have to take a break. 
 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: Okay.

Tape #4 
 
Q: Hana, I want to go back a little before 
Terezín, just to get a 
couple of pieces of 
information. Did you have pets growing up? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What did you have? 

 

A: We used to have dogs, never cats. Birds,parakeets, turtles, y-you name  it, we brought 
animals in. Both my parents were big animal
 lovers. When we moved from the original 
apartment where I was born, I don™t think ther
e were allowed dogs there, because we had 
to give up our dog. Wa s a big German Shepher
d, and he went to a farm in Votice, to 
friends. So we didn™t have a dog, but we always
 had canaries. We  had 
different birds. My 
father loved birds, and they loved him, 
because he always brought them goodies, and 

they would sing for him and not for us. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: And w-we tried to get babies by pairing 
them, and had eggs, but that never happened. 
And we had to give it up when Jews were not
 allowed to have pets. But by that time you 
didn™t have -- thank God we didn™
t have a dog we had to give up. 
 

Q: So you gave up the bir -- and you gave -- did you give them away to people who took 
care of them? 
 
A: Yes, my parents found some body who -- beca
use canaries we re pre
tty expensive those 
days for you know, not -- your dogs you got, any 
dog you could get free, but -- so I think 
people gladly accepted it. People had pets like 
that, it was a pet that they didn™t have to 
walk or do.  
 
Q: So it wasn™t unusual for people to have birds? 

 

A: No, no. As a ma tter of fact my aunt, who 
ca me from Vienna came out from the train, I 
still see her, with two cage
s in each a parakeet, these 
little green and blue, you know, 
yellow and blue parakeets. She had them until she had to give  them up, too. 
 

Q: And do you think ma ny of these animals ende
d up being killed, that they couldn™t find 
anyone?  
 

A: I don™t know, I think the Jews tried to 
find some body who would take care, who would 
love animals. I think you could find some
body. I don™t know how they did it with cats 
and dogs, because we didn™t have it, but I don™
t think we had any problem of giving it -- 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
39 
 
 
A: But it ma de you lose a friend, it™s there, you know. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Everything was a loss, whether it was the 
piano that I didn™t care so much before, or 
whether it was your jewelry that you got as
 a kid, and you know, the birthday present 
from your fa ther. You didn™t like to part with 
your things, so you didn™
t like to part with 
the animals either. 
 

Q: Right. And tell me , your -- you talked 
about going out with friends, and -- 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: But -- but did you have a so
cial life, were you dating? 
 

A: Yes, we did. Within the parties usuall
y you found a partner, and then you switched. I 
mean that going together wasn™t very serious
. It could become  serious. And then in 1939 
-- ™40 -- I think in the winter of ™40, I don™
t know, I me t a boy. That time we were still 

going to Hagiboar, which was like a pla
yground where you could run around, and do a 
little sports. That was Jewish, so that was 
allowed to go to. And I me t him there through 
another friend of my friend. Si
nce 1939, a girl lived with us. My very clo -- became  a  
close friend of mi ne. Her parents lived out
side, and they wanted her to learn the 
profession, so she was learning to sew in some
 other pl ace than I did. And she lived with 
us and we shared a room, and ti -- tha 
-- used to go weeke
nds to her parents 
[indecipherable] just fun. But 
then even that was forbidden 
because Jews couldn™t travel 
by train at all. So then she couldn™t vis
it her parents and met them only again in 
Theresienstadt, which they came from the village, she came from Prague. And her 

brother also stayed in Prague
, and lived with my  aunt, who was around the corner, wasn™t 
very far. So within, you know the group you were, and you had one or two groups, 

because you me t Saturday and Sunday with 
others. You paired up with a boyfriend. We 
were -- when Hitler came I was 14, so by that 
time we started to be interest ed in boys, 
and we did, and I had a boy that we got 
engaged when we we re 16 and a half, 17. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: My parents and his parents didn™t say anyt
hing, and that was -- he put me  later on on his 
list as a family me mber, and that™s how I ended up in Terezín. 
 

Q: Well, that™s why I asked you. 

 

A: I had to go before my par e nts, and even
 though my father was devastated, so was my 
mother, and I was. I wasn™t ready. You know, 
I wasn™t -- today 18 year old girls go to 
school, and they are ready to be on their 
own. We  were not growing up that way. We  
were never alone or going out at ni ght becau
se we never had those opportunities. And so 
we were, I don™t think, not that grown up yet. 
So for me  going for the first time out of my 
house, not knowing -- I reme mber the last ni
ght, thinking will I ever sleep in my bed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
40 
 
 
again. And my friend was staying with my parents, it was me  who had to go. And that 
was really for everybody devasta
ting. And my father 
tried to arrange and go and tell them 
that they want to -- they did not want to 
volunteer because of my 
brother. They felt if 
they -- as long as they can stay out, ma ybe 
the war will end, and we will f -- continue to 
live our norma l life. So they didn
™t volunteer, and I didn™t want them to. So they tried if I 
could wait for them, and they wouldn™t do it, so I had to go. 
 

Q: So who -- whats -- was this boy™s name ?  

 

A: In Czech it™s Honza, it™s John, and his last na me  was Kosepak.  

 

Q: So you have this funny engageme nt, and -- 

 

A: Not funny, we really thought -- 

 

Q: -- you were serious [indecipherable] 

 

A: -- we were li -- we were 
serious, we -- we thought -- 
 

Q: -- but the parents obviously -- 

 

A: -- the parents I don™t know, they didn™t -- were not against it, we knew -- both families 
knew each ot her, and f -- was nice Jewish boy. They were not agains t it, and they knew 

the war is here, and people get engaged earlie
r, or even ma rry. We  didn™t -- I didn™t 
intend to get ma rried or anythi
ng. And so we just got engaged. 
 
Q: Did he give you a ring? 
 

A: He did, and I still have the rest of it. It 
was only silver with a blue aquama rine stone. The 
stone is lost , the ring is br oken, but I keep th
e rest of it as a reme
mbrance because that 
one I smuggled, that one I gi -- didn™t give up. 
 

Q: So that was when you were 
16 and a half, now you™re --  
 

A: 17some thing. 

 

Q: -- 17. Now you™re 19, so you -- were you actually
 going together for a couple of years? 
 

A: Yes, we were --  

 

Q: So you were -- 

 

A: -- not 19, I w -- he went with the 
second transport, he was just in -- 
 

Q: In ™40 -- in 1940?  Or ™41? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
41 
 
 
A: 1941, with the second men transport, 
Edgar went with the first one -- 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- he was with the Akar, too, which was 
Nove mber ™41. He just became 18, and I was 18 
September. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And we me t  again when 
I arrived in July ™42. 
 

Q: Now you just me ntioned some thing that I 
think is important. Akar one and Akar two. 
 

A: Aufbaukommando. 

 

Q: And can you explain what that means? 

 

A: The first ones, because they were 
supposed to build Terezín, were called 
Aufbaukommando one. That was the 340 
some thing that Edgar went with. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: After that we nt another thousand me
n, only me n, and it was called Akar two, 
Aufbaukommando number two. 
 

Q: And do these become  privileged -- 
 
A: They were -- were privileged one degree below the Akar one. 

 

Q: I see. And then everyone who 
come s after, it™s not Akar -- 
 

A: No, it™s already, it -- 

 

Q: It -- it™s gone, y -- 

 

A: -- first started with, I think 
Edgar™s transport -- parents were
 M. I was already in triple 
digit transport, AAR647 was my number. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: My parents were already in CC alpha
bet. The whole AAA, and the BBBB alphabet. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And they came  at CC [i ndecipherable] 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
42 
 
 
Q: But it™s only the Akar one and Ak
ar two that become  [indecipherable] 
 

A: Two that they™re aristocrastic. We call them aristocrastic. 

 

Q: Aris -- aristocrastic. No
w when y -- when John -- John? 

 

A: Well, Honza we called him 

 

Q: Honza-- 

 

A: Hanush in Czech. 

 

Q: -- went, was that shocking to you? 

 

A: To both of us. We  didn™t -- we had fun 
together, we enjoyed 
each other company -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- we didn™t want to separate. But he said to
 separate from his pare
nts, too, his parents 
didn™t go. 
 

Q: So he didn™t volunteer for that transport? 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: Did he tell you he was going to try and get you to -- to come  -- 
 
A: No-- 

 

Q: -- trying to get you on the list? 

 

A: -- but I think they enticed them, they said
 if you put them -- thes
e two transports were 
supposed to be kept in Te rezín, they were
 like privileged, they 
didn™t think -- and, you 
know, like Edgar they send him with the last tran
sports, it wasn™t in any other. And they 
said if you put your fami ly me mbers on your list, 
they will be also privileged. So I think 
that™s why he did that. He didn™t me a n to ge
t me into -- but that™s
 how Edgar™s parents 
too, because they were on his li
st as parents, came in early. 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: So that™s what happened. 

 

Q: So what happens, you get a notice through the ma
il, or it™s delivered to you?  What -- how 
-- do you reme mber? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
43 
 
 
A: I don™t know how that was delivered, but I got 
a notice on that and that day, to be at the 
palace with 50 kilos, which is 110 pounds, what 
is allowed to take, and that™s it, you go. 
My brother went in the stre
etcar with me , you had to car
ry the 50 pounds yours -- kilo -- 
yourself, up to where you had to register. Wh
at you had was a backpack, a roll where you 
had your pillow, your linen, and you put in so
me  food or anything. We  call it bedrollup -- 
bedroll, and the trunk. So some how I got from
 my boyfriend -- fiancé, whatever you want 
to call it, a notice through his parents that
 I should ma ke a white rectangle around my 
name  because he will save my lugga ge, becau
se the luggage  was confiscated usually, and 
you ended up only with the backpack and the roll.
 Not the first transport, only when -- in 
™42, so Edgar doesn™t even know about it. 
So, you know, we had to put Sa rah in our 
name , every woma n was  Sarah, and every ma n wa
s Israel, to degrade us more. We  didn™t 
-- we used to say we are privileged, because 
Chur chill™s daughter is name d s -- Sarah. So 
we very proudly carried that. I was Hana Sara
h Fuchsova. So -- or German Fuchs. So we 
did it, and he did save my luggage, and he 
saved the same  way my parent™s luggage. He  
worked at that time at the transpor ts
, and he kept his j
ob to help people. 
 
Q: So a -- in this early stages, they -- you we
re able to get some messages fr om Terezín once 
-- 
 

A: I don™t know how he did it, but he did do that. 

 

Q: He did it. 

 

A: Well, you know, there were nine boys hanged 
for letter writing in Te
rezín in January ™42. 
 

Q: No, I didn™t know. 
 
A: Oh yes, that™s very well known. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And -- because they wrot e letters and they we
re -- and they were 
caught, so they were 
executed. Edgar can tell you about it, he 
was there when that happened, we -- 
 

Q: This is before -- 

 

A: And we knew about it in Prague because th
at was ma de sure every Jew knows it. The 
Germans ma de sure, so that they don™t write letters. But through some  of the gendarmes 

evidently, he succeeded, give them something, 
and he smuggled a letter to his parent s, 

and his parents told us.  
 

Q: When you™re going to be dropped off by your brother -- 

 

A: My brother wouldn™t go out of
 that streetcar, he pr omised 
my father he wouldn™t because 
he was afraid they can pi ck him off the street
, and bri -- if there is a [indecipherable] 
company. So he was in the streetcar with me at the back, cause we had -- as we were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
44 
 
 
passing, I saw my father standing on the corner
, he wanted a last glimpse of me . Crying. 
And then he just had to go another station, my
 brother, and then he returned home. And I 
had to walk up the street to the entrance by myse lf. 
 

Q: And your mother stayed inside, by herself. 

 

A: My mother stayed home. 

 

Q: Were you crying on the train, do you reme mber? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Well we were, I think three days or four 
days it took, till they processed the thousand 
people. Register. And I don™
t think they even weigh our
 luggage, you could have had 
more, but nobody dared. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I-- 

 

Q: Were you in a cattle car? 

 

A: No. Until we went -- th
is is with a streetcar. 
 
Q: The streetcar, right, 
is the normal streetcar? 
 
A: Yeah. I-In T- Terezí n we were in a ca ttle ca r.  

 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: But that didn™t take thre
e days, that was in one day, a
lthough it took very long, for it™s 
only 60 miles. We arrived some where after
noon, three o™clock in Terezín from they 
started to load at five
 in the morning, so -- 
 

Q: So you were waiting in Pra
gue to leave for three days? 
 

A: In Prague for processi
ng took at least three days. 
 

Q: Threedays. 

 

A: Because I arrived on the 16
th
 of July in -- in Terezín. 
 

Q: And you had left your house on -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
45 
 
 
A: Aroundthe13
th
 -- 
 
Q: 13
th
. 
 

A: -- I think it was. 

 

Q: When you™re waiting in Prague, and you™re goi
ng with your brother 
on it -- on the street, 
what™s your biggest fear?  Do y -- do you know, or is it very confused? 
 

A: I™m afraid. I™m a fraid to do this alone. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: I was scared, I had never been alone. 

 

Q: Alone. 

 

A: Either with my brother, or with my pare
nts, and I have never b
een alone like that.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: To have to take care of myself, and that™s when I promised my mother I will -- 

 

Q: You™lleat. 

 

A: Eat everything, and they gave us this big 
portion of the watery -- brown water, which was 
supposed to be coffee. So I promised Mother 
I™ll finish everything I™
ll get. So I finished 
and drank it. My friend thought I like it, she 
gave me  again. And I hated it, but I said I 
will drink it because I promised 
my mother to eat everyt hing. 
 

Q: Now, w-when you™re wa iting these there da
ys, and there are a thous
and people, are there 
people that you know? 
 

A: I didn™t know anybody, but you start talking to 
your neighbor -- and I had the same  name  
because you are alphabetically put on the ma ttresses. And you try -- you walk around 

trying to find some body whether you know, a
nd it™s a long day. You wait, you get to -- 
you have to go to the table, you have to re
gister. You have to give up your trunk. The 
bedroll and the rucksack you carry
 yourself. This is in July. 
I had a winter coat on, I had a 
suit underneath. I had double -- double unde
rwear. I had heavy shoes because you 
wouldn™t take sandals. And I had to lug the 
luggage, and we walked from Bohusovice to 

Terezín, and some  people fainted, and some  pe
ople couldn™t make it, it was very hot. I 
did. And when we came into the -- they br
ought us to Hanover barracks. That was the 
Schleusse they called it, th
e accepting barracks. Didn™t ta
ke long and my boyfriend was 
there, telling me , I have your trunk. And I told 
him right away to tell my friend that I am 
here, which he did. And he brought he r ove
r, he  smuggled her in, because nobody was 

allowed to come  near us. And they had to pr
ocess us again. And her mot her arranged that

they move me to Ha mburger where they were
 staying. She took over like my mother, her 
mother, and she later on saved my life again. So
 when we came to register, I already had 
a address where to go, I went straight to Ha
mburg, and then my friend said she™s working 
at the mi ca production, where we peeled the mi
ca. So she went imme diately and signed 
me  up for that. So the next day I went to wo
rk with her. So I had some body there. And 
then you start -- and then I tried to locate my
 grandma, who was there. My grandmother, 
si -- about three weeks before 
me  -- 15 -- or four weeks, 15
th
 of June she left Prague, my 
grandmother. So then my  boyfriend located he
r, and that™s when I say Edgar is wrong, it 
wasn™t yet opened the ghetto, he had to get me a false document, of another girl to -- so I 

can go to visit her into
 that house. And I did, 
and I saw my gr andma. 
 

Q: So it wasn™t allowed, yo
u couldn™t just walk around. 
 

A: Not yet, it was op -- and she died on 22
nd
 of August of that same
 year, and by that time it 
was opened. But when I arrived -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- I couldn™t move freely, any -- and the firs
t thing she told me , she was so happy -- she 
was blind, but she knew who I am, s he was so happy to see -- see me . Acc ording to our -- 

what we counted, she was 86. According to what
 they have in the files, she was born ™54, 
not ™56 as we  thought. So she mi ght have been
 88. As I say, she la
sted about six weeks 
there. Got sick, she died of dysentery. And the 
fi rst thing she said, ﬁTell your father not to 
come .ﬂ She thought my father was a powerfu
l ma n, can do anything, and he can say I am 
not going, and he will not go. ﬁIt™s a terrible
 place here. Why did you come?  He should 

have taken care of you, you should not co
me  here.ﬂ I don™t think she understood, you 
know, the situation. 
 

Q: But she understood some thing. 

 

A: Oh, she understood that it™s a bad place -- 

 

Q: Badplace. 

 

A: -- but she didn™t know -- 

 

Q: What. 

 

A: -- that you have no choice. 

 

Q: Yeah. How did this w-w- woma n, the -- the 
mother of your friend, and what -- what was 
her name , and -- and the -- the name  of your friend, and the mother™s name. 
 

A: Okay, my fr iend was named Eva, their name was Dittel. 

 

Q: Dittel? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
47 
 
 
 
A: And I called her Mama Dittel afterwards. And 
she died in Munich at age 101 and a half. 
So I saw her last time when we went th
ere to celebrate her 
hundredth birthday. 
 

Q: Wow.  

 

A: And what she did for me , in September of ™
42, I was put in for deportation to Poland -- to 
east, nobody knew where. And she decided that
™s ridiculous, her parents are still in 
Prague. She went to [indecipherable] and put
 down the -- my application. She was OD, 
Ordnungsdienst, so she could do it
. And said, ﬁThis girl is no
t 21 yet, her parents are in 
Prague, how can you send her alone?ﬂ And put
 stamp, do not send. So I got out of the 
transpor t, and I didn™t realize somebody else 
must have gotten in because of me . That 
time we didn™t think that way. 
 

Q: Yeah, right, right. Now it™s -- 

 

A: That came only when the people started to
 ask are you guilty of -- yes, some body else 
must have gone, because thousand people had to go -- 
 

Q: So they had to -- 

 

A: -- and that™s one transp
ort where they have destin
ation unknown. Nobody knows what 
happened to the thousand people.  
 

Q: Really? 

 
A: That™s the September transport to the east. 
 

Q: So the -- uh-huh. And -- 

 

A: I found it only, you know, after we got the 
-- the me morial book from Prague, from the 
Terezín inshairtif. They colle
cted a book of all the name s 
and birthdays and where they 
went and where people died. And all the trans
port that went ever to -- to Lódz, or to 
Terezín, and where they went fu
rther, and their -- this -- under that transport, destination 
unknown.  
 

Q: Hm. And they have the name s of all 
the people who are on them?  Oh, excuse me . 
 

A: Well, that is hard to find 
who -- they have the name  of th
e transport, you would have to 
go through all the people. 
 

Q: Uh-huh, to find it. 

 

A: To find that there -- when you have your na
me  there, it says where you were liberated, 
and where you died if they know it. If they 
don™t know it, it™s the transport where that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
48 
 
 
went where you died. Because ma ny people went
 straight to Treblinka, so they don™t 
have the date or anything. 
 
Q: Right. And what was Mama  Dittel™s ti --  she 
was -- let™s explain what that  is, that -- 
 

A: She was a real, very aggre
ssive, in that case woman, she 
got the job, and she would -- OD 
means Ordnungsdienst, which meant she was re
sponsible anywhere there was a line, to 
keep order, and so if she kept order on -- in
 the line for people to go into the offices or 

some thing when they requested -- everywhere
 you waited in line. Whatever you wanted. 

In -- you wanted a job or some thing, there wa
s 50 people lined up for that, too. So they 
needed these people who kept people not fighting, and to keep them in line. 
 

Q: Right. So she had -- 

 

A: So she had such a kind of job, she was sta
nding near the kettle so people don™t fight for 
the food when they were giving out food that was her job. And Eva and I worked 

together. We are s -- friends, we were friends
 from Prague already, she was one of the 
group. So we used to go to her house, to our house, you know, and to others, she was a 

me mber of one of the groups that I was in. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And she was there since January ™42, they we
nt early. And her father 
was there too at that 
ti -- and I knew the whole fa mily, 
my  mother knew the whole fa mily. 
 

Q: So the mother had a certain -- certain ki
nd of position, which was why she could get you 
-- 
 

A: No, she was on the -- yeah, but she was also
 very aggressive, she could get it, you know, 
some body else wouldn™t. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: Some body else wouldn™t ma rch into the 
office of the [indecipherable], she did. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And she was accepted, pe ople accepted her. She had a way with people.  

 

Q: And in -- in the same  way she got you in
to the other barrack. Instead of being in 
Ha mburger you were in Hanover -- 
 

A: Probably, I don™t -- 

 

Q: -- no, a -- the reve
rse, the reverse. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
49 
 
 
A: No, that -- that was ten -- temporary 
anyhow. They would assign you where to go, they 
would ma ke a list wherever they ha d place,
 but if you had some body, and wanted to be 
together with the family, and there was room, they would do it. I got my mother then, to 
be with me  in the room, too. We  just put it 
on her list, you know, as a request. That -- the 
-- where to put people wa
sn™t diffi cult to get -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- because they didn™t care. If there wasn™t 
room, I had to sleep on 
the fl oor between the -
- on the corridor unt
il there was room. There was constant moveme nt. Pe ople moved 
around, they found a friend, they wanted to be pu
t together, that was not so hard to do. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And transpor ts went, so there were empty spaces -- 

 

Q: Spaces. 

 

A: -- you when -- that was like a seniority. Y
ou started on the floor, and ended up where you 
wanted after awhile, when 
it got -- became available. 
 

Q: So y -- 

 

A: So in the end, Eva and I had a bunk together. 

 

Q: Together. And you were in Hanover? 
 
A: Ha mburger. 

 

Q: Ha mburger. 

 

A: Ha mburger. Hanover wher
e -- where we arrived. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: And then -- then Hamburger became  what
 they called Schleusse, for incomi ng and 
outgoing transport, but at mi  -- some times 
it was a different barrack, whichever they 
emptied for it. When I came in ™42, it was Hamb urger, when my parents came , there were 

in a different -- Hanover -- when my parents 
came it was in a different [indecipherable]. 
 

Q: Different place. And Schleusse means what? 

 

A: Schleusse is where the wa ter goes thr
ough. People comi ng and going, and that™s probably 
how the -- they took it and was a expression 
I learned only in Terezín. In Czech it™s 
Schoishka, so they took over the word, gave only a Czech ending. I-It me ans passing 

through, probably. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
50 
 
 
 
Q: But this was also where they would confis
cate the luggage, am I right?  They would take 
it -- 
 

A: The luggage never arrived there. The luggage
 was put on some carts that the people that 
worked in the transports schlepped, like my
 boyfr iend, and they schl
epped it directly to 
the ma gazines or to the st orage where they st
ore them. This clothing original was only for 
Germans, that the Jews didn™t 
get it, only until they opened th
e stores, did they share the 

clothi ng for those -- from those storerooms w
ith the Jews. Because th-the Germans were 
bombed out, they lost everything. They needed
 clothing, so they took it from the Jews.  
 

Q: Right. And was your boyfriend -- wa s Honza 
taking a chance bringing you your luggage? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: He was, wasn™t he? 

 

A: Yes, but he did it for his pa
rents, and for my parents too. 
 

Q: So did you then take the lugga
ge a -- I mean, put the clothes -- 
 

A: He brought it after wa -- 
he kept it until I had a permanent place in the Hamburger. 
 

Q: I see. And where did you keep the lu
ggage?  Under the bed, or what did you do? 
 

A: No, I didn™t have a space under the bed. 
 
Q: Okay. 

 

A: I lived on the upper -- 

 

Q: Oh, you were on the upper?  So then what did you do? 

 

A: -- upper bunk. There was a shelf and I put 
the trunk that was a
ll where you had your 
clothes, you couldn™t hang it, you co
uldn™t -- you didn™t have anything. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So you kept it in the trunk, and 
the bedding you spread on your bed. 
 

Q: And where -- where would be this
 shelf? Near the -- near the -- 
 

A: O-Our bunk was -- we had the top, the two of us. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
51 
 
 
A: And the shelf was going towards -- there was a window, and the shelf was going to the 
window. So on that shelf I had the trunk. 
 
Q: So some one had to lift up this fif -- 

 

A: Yeah. The mi ddle one had also a shelf, the bottom one had it underneath. But the trunks 
became my bed later on. The tr -- 
 

Q: And I -- the trunk became your bed? 

 

A: Yeah. Three trunks ma de a bed on th
e -- on a trip with
 [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Did you -- excuse me , did you have a lock on this trunk?  We re you concerned about 
people stealing?  No. 
 

A: No. I doubt it. 

 

Q: Okay. I think we should stop the tape. 

 

End of Tape #4

Tape #5 
 
Q: Hana, I want to ask you some  details about the -- 

 

A: Arrangeme nt? 

 

Q: Arrangeme nts, yes. So you™re on the t
op bunk, although it takes you a little while to get 
to the top bunk. Is that when -- when you™re 
in the top bunk, is that when Eva is up there 
as well? 
 

A: She was there already, and her partner, what
ever -- whoever lived 
there, then moved out 
of -- I don™t know where, was pretty fast, ther
e was always a mor, or found a better, or 
found some where else to live. When it emptied, and I was on the floor, a -- but nobody 

else wanted it, I could get it. 
It went according to seniorit
y. Each room we were about 40 
wome n in the room, and there was one wo
ma n who was called Zimmeralteste, which 
means the oldest of the room. And s he was th
e one who ma de the decisions. So -- but she 
was pretty good, she -- you know, honored some
 request, it didn™t change anything for 
her. So it didn™t matter if I was in the corridor, meanwhile, when my mother came she 

was in the corridor. She couldn™t climb up because she suffered fro m sciatica nerve, 

otherwise I would have switched with her, but
 it couldn™t. And then 
she got right away a 
bed because of that, so you know, she ma de
 those decisions, she also ma de sure 

everything is clean, that the r
oom looks clean, because therewere checks some ti me s. And 
-- and I don™t know by whom, but we were alwa
ys expecting some  inspections. And then 
she also was the one that distributed the 
rations. You got a ration of bread. Some times  

you got little bit of milk, which was like bluish
 water. And some ti me s 
you got little bit of 
sugar, and ma rgarine, those were the rations. 
So she got the whole th
ing, and she had to 
divide it into 40, so there was enough, you got a big s -- soupspoon of sugar, if was more, 

you got two. Bread was always the same , you go
t a piece of bread, 
that was for three 
days. Being me, the first time I got the bread I 
ate it. In two days I didn™t, so I learned 

very fast that I ma rked how much bread I 
can eat every day. And that was only once that 
it happened that I ate it all. A
nd I took little bit supply from 
what I had from ma r. So, s he 
was the responsible person. She al
so decided if we had little 
bit of wood, when to heat up 
the room or not, because there was only little stove, in that -- in -- for wint er. So it was 

pretty cold, but you had the blankets. You di
d have blankets. So we slept with Eva 
huddled toge ther under two blankets, we didn™t need each a bl anket. In summer it was 

much worse. The bedbugs were terrible, and we
 would take our ma ttresses and put it on 
the corridor outside, in front of the ro
om, along the -- you know how these windows are 
in Hamburger -- 
 

Q: These round [indecipherable] windows, yes. 

 

A: -- barrack? Under the windows, and we sl
ept outside, because 
it was too buggy, and too 
muggy inside. 
 

Q: So it was buggier 
inside than outside? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
53 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
 

Q: And what sort of a ma ttress was this, 
was this straw?  Or was this a real -- 
 

A: Yes,straw. 

 

Q: It was straw. 

 

A: Straw. I think that™s what all the Czec hs us
ed. I think that™s what was mostly they used, 
horsehair mattresses in good times, but I think for 
us they -- it didn™t ma
tter, we slept. We  
were so tired, we slept. The first -- I wasn™t
 so tired from the mi ca peeling, or some thing, 
that was si tting down. We had fun because we 
were -- that™s where we made most of the 
friendships, we were eight gi
rls together. Course the young 
clung together and we were 
also a very noisy tabl e, because we were 
telling our th-things, and we were laughing and 
things, and the old people didn™t li -- the old pe
ople, they were in their 40™s and 50™s, 
didn™t like it, so they were always hushing 
us that nobody can hear when we are there. 
And all of us knew that this 
is a terrible job, dust
y, sitting and peeling them, and we had 
to make a -- sort them, a nd make a certain
 amount a day. It wa
sn™t just playing, you 
know. 
 

Q: Wh-Wh -- what -- what  -- 

 

A: It™s a -- it™s a -- 

 

Q: What is it? 

 
A: -- the mi ca you have to peel thin, they sa
id it™s for the airplane, and there was bigger 
pieces, smaller pi eces, and you had to sort them according to sizes. 
 
Q: And then you peel the -- 

 

A: Peel it into thin, like if you would peel -- 

 

Q: Anonion? 

 

A: -- anything in layers.  

 

Q: Yeah, yeah. So it -- there would be
 a number of layers on the mi ca -- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- and you would peel it off. 

 

A: You would peel it to the th
innest one and then the supervis
or checked that there is not 
some thing wrong, no -- the sizes 
are all right, and 
-- because he was responsible to the 
German. So we all tried to get into a bette
r job, and one of my friends with whom I™ m 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
54 
 
 
friend to -- today, she lives in Los Vegas, she decided -- she had a boyfriend too, that 
time. And who told her to get into agriculture. 
So she was the first one
 to leave the table, 
the -- you know, the eight of us. Then two others went to agricultu
re, so I decided I™m 
going too. And I went and apply for the job a
nd they -- I said I come  from a farm, my 
grandpa was a farmer. 
 

Q: Hewas? 

 

A: So they asked me  how potatoes grow, I ha
d no idea, because I have never seen potatoe s 
grow. So I don™t know where I got it, I said, ﬁL
ike onions, with the -- with the roots in the 
ground.ﬂ And they said, she knows, a
nd I was in my -- in agriculture. 
 

Q: Now where would you -- fir-first of all le
t me  ask you, why was it -- I-I -- one would 
think that working inside would be better th
an working outside, but 
that was not the case 
there? 
 

A: What did I have, I had nothing from work
ing inside. I peeled mi  -- for mi ca that I 
couldn™t do anything with. I breathe in 
the particles, and [indecipherable] 
 

Q: There™s a lot of -- 

 

A: I wanted to get out. 

 

Q: Uh-huh,okay. 

 

A: They told you get out into the fields, 
and you can eat the vegetable, so I got out.  
 

Q: So then where -- where do you go to apply for a job in this -- 

 

A: There was a place where you -- the groups alwa
ys gather, that was 
called Drusstvo, it was 
like a collection place where they had offices. Th
ese were lot of people, and lot of fields 
that had to be. They had cows -- they had hor
ses, not cows, and they had pigs, and there 
had to be organization, and there was a head 
of that, and then over him wa s the German 
head, who was in the party but was not -- who 
was not a SS, was a civilian. He must have 
been me mbe r  of the Nazi party, was a civilia
n. So there was a organization, so they had 
to meet in the offices and the -- the storerooms where we stored some of it, because we 

grew all kinds of vegetable. So my friend st
arted it, she knew wher
e to go, she taught me , 
I went there.  
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: And I got in. Which was in winter, which wa
sn™t the best  thing because we were in the 
freezing cold all day. But you were outside, a
nd you got out of the ghetto. My father, my 

mother never set foot out that since the day they came .  
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
55 
 
 
 
A: And -- behind the wall. I was out every day. 

 

Q: So did you -- 

 

A: [indecipherable]group. 

 

Q: -- so you -- did you have a differe
nt sense of yourself, and was it -- 

 

A: A different sense of jealousy. I saw people, 
I said people still live
 norma lly, how is that 
possible? They walk on the road, they went 
with the horses, we had to go to the side 
because we were ma rching in columns, with
 the gendarmes, two gendarmes with their 

rifles, so we don™t run away, or
 don™t pick up a fallen apple, drop the apple from the trees. 
And people were -- passed the SS -- we went al
ong the river, and we passed the SS -- like 
for swi mmi ng place, and they were there si tti
ng and enjoying themselves with children. 
And I couldn™t understand why we can™t have 
a norma l life. It was very -- we were 
jealous, why do we have to be like this?  Why couldn™t we be like them? 
 

Q: So it was a conflicting -- a situation of conflict. 

 

A: Yeah, we -- we -- we talked about it, what
 we will do when we get free. You know, we -- 
I reme mber saying I wish I was -- I cou -- I don
™t care how old I will be
 at the -- as soon 
as I can say it™s 10 years after the war. It
™s -- you know, we wished for the impossible 
that time.  
 

Q: Were you very hungry all the time? 
 
A: Not when I started to work in the agricu
lture, no I had the [indecipherable], I brought in 
the vegetables, I smuggled them in my bra. 
 

Q: But this was very danger -- w-was some
one -- a group called Berusky, s-some thing -- 
 

A: Berusky yes, but I was the only person that never was examined by them or touched. 
When I went to work, they were there only 
at the j -- gate when I working on another 
place. I was the good luck charm for my gr
oup. I had never been searched by them. 
 

Q: Never? 

 

A: Never. And I went every day to work. 

 

Q: Now explain who Beruskys wa -- what the name  -- 

 

A: Those were wome n, SS German, 
that waited at the gate, that
 were allowed to frisk us. 
And of course, if they found some thing was the 
same  like SS. So we were afraid of them. 
Some times you had a good gendarme who woul
d warn you, and some  people were 
caught. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
56 
 
 
 
Q: Why do you think you were -- it™s an -- 

 

A: I don™t know. 

 

Q: You don™t know. 

 

A: I don™t know, I never lived it. I lived thr
ough one search. There was a big -- this was in 
summer, June ™44. We  called it afterwards, fa
shion show. What happened, they caught -- 
there were people who were transporting ashe
s out of the town from the kitchens, and 
from where they were heating in big -- I don
™t know, they were ashes. And un -- they -- 
they were stopped by some  SS, and they found some  lettuce. These people were 

imprisoned, and everybody who was on the fiel
d were -- had to stop working, and they 
hoarded us into one of the barracks, into one
 of those -- there were -- in the -- in the 
bastion or whatever that is, 
there were rooms, and there we
 had to -- they took four and 
four wi m -- girls in, and they 
had to strip totally, and the 
SS -- and we were stage -- 
standing naked in front of the SS, and th 
-- he checked whether you don™t have anything. 
And then you dressed, and we didn™t know what th
ey will do with us, but they did let us 

go. This took a whole day till everybody was 
frisked, till three or 
four, and we went 
home. But while we ther e -- we were there, we didn™t. But that was the only time I was 

frisked like that. And because the gendarme s 
were there, and of course they knew us, 
they were wa tching with us, we had to stri
p to be naked, we calle
d it fashion show. And 
we always said, ﬁOh, that one was in the -- at
 the fashion show.ﬂ Because he was with us, 
so -- that was one time, but we
 still -- I don™t think we were
 afraid that something will 
happen to us, because we didn™t ha ve anything, 
whatever we had, we ate. A girl had a -- 

something like a lettuce, so we ate it all. It --
 it was just swallow a little wa d of paper. My 
sister -i n-law said they had to swallow someth
ing else, like piece of -- they had a crown, 
or the money on them, which was supposedly ha
rder. She just told 
me  now, I didn™t know 
it. She was in -- my sister-in-law was with 
another group, she was there, too. So I wasn™t 
sure which one, she says it was June ™44. Wa
s hard to reme mb er dates, you didn™t have 
calendars, so you didn™t know exactly, but you knew when it™s Sunday, and you knew 
dates, but to reme mber the dates, you don™t. 
The one date I reme mber is -- did you ever 
hear about the census taking in Terezín? 
 

Q: From?  Oh y e s. 

 

A: Nove mber11
th
, 1943? 
 

Q: Yes,tell 
us about it. 
 

A: Oh, we were the first barracks, because Ham
burger is right on the e
dge of Terezín. So we 
got the notice that everyone has to be count
ed, we  didn™t know how extensive it is, and 
what it means, but we had to line up in the 
courtyard at five in the morning. Because it 
was Nove mber, some  people took a blanket with them, whic h was very good, because it 

was fr-freezing cold to stand there all day. 
We  didn™t know what they™ll do. And they 
ma rched us into this place, which was not
 like a valley, but it 
was surrounded by little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
57 
 
 
higher, you know, not wall, the earth was like a 
division between fields, but it was higher, 
much higher, so -- there™s a Czech word for it,
 like a small valley or something. And they 
ma rched you by hundreds, always. And we ca me th
ere, and we were one of the first ones, 
so we were right on the edge. And they put
 the SS with machine guns on top of these 
things, so we  got little frightened what will 
be on -- they going to
 shoot us here?  They 
said to count, some body supposedly ran away, 
and there the count wa
s off. And I never 
heard counting one by one. So I think it t
ook nearly all morning till everybody got 
assembled there, or till 10 - 11, I have no id
ea. And then people started to walk around. 
My brother lived me  and my parents, but I 
was the only one -- by that time my father got 
the room in one of the houses, and Mother and 
Father lived together, because he was also 
privileged. And I still stayed in Hamburger,
 and my brother found with a friend in the 
cellar a room, and they made themselves in 
the cellar a -- a room for them. So he lived 
near my parents, so they were together in 
the column, but I was again separated. So then 
my f -- brother found me, and I went over to 
say hi to my parents, that I™m okay, and 
everybody™s there. But then you were afraid, 
because the Germans were walking by, and 
you were not allowed to move. And when you 
have to go to the bathroom, luckily you 
had the blanket, some body put it around you. A
nd they were counted, one by one every 
column was counted. And it was getting dark, 
in -- in -- in November, it™s not so long 
daylight. And we decided to talk how nice 
it will be, I will kiss my bunk if I get home. 
We didn™t know whether we will be there all 
ni ght. It was pretty upsetting. So by 11 at 
night we got home . We  were 
again the last  ones, because we were the first ones comi ng 
in, some  got earlier. The next day my  father sa
id that™s it, the family has to be together, 
you have to move in. So I moved in with my 
parents, I was very wi
lling. I didn™t like to 
be separated. My brother was again with th
em, and I was in. My brother lived in the 
house next to them, so the whole block of hous
es went together, he was not separated. So 
there was not room for a nother bed, so on 
the floor we put the trunks, and then we 
separated them -- the door was blocked. And 
-- and when -- during the day we put them 
up like a seat. So that was the room I had th
ere with my parents, in November ™43. 
 
Q: So -- well -- now let™s go back. So you 
left the mi ca working, you™re working the 
agriculture, you work six da
ys a week or seven? 
 

A: Six days a week. 

 

Q: Six days a week. 

 

A: Not seven, no. There were days when we had to work on Sundays when there was 
harvest, and ma ybe it would rain and they want
ed to get the hay in, 
or the -- the harvest 
wasn™t, for the Germans, going fast enough. Those days we would, from e a rly morning 

till light was out, 10 o™clock or so -- there were days. But regularly six days a week.  
 

Q: And what are you do -- doing?  [indecipherable] 

 

A: Well I have -- every group was diffe rent
, and everybo-body -- I got 
into the group with 
my friends because I wanted to be with them, 
wit h this girlfriend that I had. And I got in 

what they call the field group. And we were desi
gnated to take care of
 the toma to fields, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
58 
 
 
which was near a village called Travcice, so th
at those fields were called that. And ther e 
we went every day. We  had to plant them,we ha d to tie them. Everything was done by 
hand. We  had to clean all the weeds every ti
me . We had to harvest them, we had to 
prepare the fi elds for next season. In between 
they had some  kohlrabi or other vegetable, 
we had to harvest that. And then if some th
ing was necessary, we had to plant other -- 
other vegetable, there we re fields. Spinach 
fields, there were beet -- beets. You know, 
anything that you are doing agri
culture, there is always work
 to -- they would put the 
field, and there was a Staabsgarten, which was -- they were the -- this was for the German 

population soldiers, or population. But there 
was a garden where they had vegetables 
only for the SS, for the SS kitchen where th
ey cooked for them, and for the whole SS 
soldiers [indecipherable]. So my friend, the one
 that we went to sc
hool together, worked 
there. And she went every day there towork. You know, everybody had different places. 

My other two friends were -- their mother jo
ined too in agriculture
, and they worked on 
the place where they -- so when I went to he
lp out there, I had onions, I could bring home  
onions. You know, it™s -- we stole anything we
 could, and we ate anything we could. 
 

Q: And did you usually
 eat it there? 
 

A: What we ate, I wouldn™t touch a toma to at 
home, I ate tomatoes all day. That was all I ate 
all day, I me an, no bread, I wouldn™t use the br
ead when I had toma toes. [indecipherable] 
my stomach was full of vegetable, and we -- 
when we were harvesting kohlrabi we would 
-- but we had to cover up the peels or  anythi
ng, because we were not allowed to eat. And 

we had a lookout, because Heindel, who was supervising us, SS, had the motorcycle, we  

could hear hi m. The lookout will hear him, so
 we wouldn™t eat, and we would work very 

hard when he came. And if hear -- saw so
me body standing up, he gave us two hour mo re 
work, the whole group. So we had a lookout. A
nd the lookouts were on all fields, and we 
whistled. We  had a sign to whistle, then he fo
rbid to whistle, so we were barking like a 
dog. I mean, we found always a way to -- 
to -- I -- I have to put my hand up. 
 

Q: To -- to s -- to signal people. 

 

A: Signal. And we had a lookout for that.  

 

Q: Were you getting f -- whatever normal food w
ould be getting -- i -- people getting in the 
ghetto during the day that you™re working? 
 

A: Yes, we went home for lunch.  

 

Q: Oh, you we nt back to -- 

 

A: We had to go home  for lunch and come  out again. 

 

Q: I see. So you would have whatever br
eakfast, if they had anything, in Terezín. 
 

A: We had -- breakfast was black coffee. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
59 
 
 
Q: Blackcoffee. 
 

A: And we had a bread. We  had a piece of bread. 

 

Q: So you would get bread for three days that you had to eat. 

 

A: Yeah, a certain, it was 
this -- about 
this big. 
 

Q: And where would you -- 

 

A: Like a big loaf, and a fourth
 was the -- but then my brothe
r worked in the bakery, so we 
had more. 
 

Q: Where would you keep the bread? 

 

A: Except my mother wasn™t a good -- we kept it 
outside, on a paper. My mother wasn™t a -- 
no [indecipherable] or anything, my
 mother was a giver. There lived a lot of old people in 
the housing, she would share 
with them what I brought, [i
ndecipherable] the bread, too. 
My father wasn™t allowed to know about it.  
 

Q: Now, wait a mi nute, but -- there™s a period of
 time when you™re working in the fields, and 
your parents are not there. 
Am I correct?  That you -- 
 

A: No, my parents were there. By the 
winter of ™43, my pa
rents were there. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. So by the time  you have the job -- 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- in the agriculture -- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- they™re there. But you 
don™t move in with them -- 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: -- for a -- 

 

A: No, I stayed in the Hamb urger. Mother 
was with the Hambur ger. My father and my 
brother were in Sudeten barrack. 
 

Q: Barracks. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
60 
 
 
A: And after my father got established, a
nd found his way around, a
nd became  me mber of 
the imagdabolt, and after the housing was to
tally empty then, I mean available or 
whatever, I don™t know whethe
r it was empty already. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: He got the room for Mother and him. So th
at was little later, that
 was also around winter 
of ™43. First they were
 in barracks two -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh, okay, right. Now, when I -- when
 I asked you about where would you keep the 
bread, when you were living in
 the barrack, you weren™t -- 
 

A: You kept it up on top on your shelf. 

 

Q: Ontop? 

 

A: Nobody would steal it. 

 

Q: And what about the bugs?  Did they eat it? 

 

A: The bugs don™t eat bread, no, they eat your blood. 

 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: They suck your blood. 

 
Q: Isee. 
 

A: Bed -- bedbugs suck your blood [indecipherable] 

 

Q: Were there lice? Were there lice? 

 

A: Yes, there we re lice, but luckily we didn™
t have it, that was our biggest concern if 
some body got lice, they shaved his head. Her head. 
 

Q: Or her. And nobody got lice in your group? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: And how come ?  

 

A: We were very careful. I don™t know.  

 

Q: You don™t know? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
61 
 
 
A: I don™t know where the lice were more prev
alent, but nobody had in our room, in the 
barracks. You tried to keep -- you wash
ed your hair, tried to keep clean. 
 
Q: And you wa shed your hair with what? 

 

A: Cold water and soap. 

 

Q: You had some  soap?  

 

A: I think we must have gotten - couldn™t be 
there for three years that
 I was there, I brought 
enough soap with me . 
 

Q: [indecipherable]yes. 

 

A: The soap was swimmi ng. You know, that 
was not the regular soap. The war soap. 
 

Q: What do you mean it was swimmi ng? 

 

A: It wouldn™t sink. 

 

Q: It wou -- it was very light? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: I see. And did you have toothpaste? 

 
A: I don™t know. Maybe in the beginning. 
 

Q: Did you brush your teeth? 

 

A: We did. We  had to go to the dentist, but he
 couldn™t do much. My teeth were -- I got my 
wisdom teeth there, and afterw
ards they had to be pulled, bu
t we didn™t have much de ntal 
care, but there was a dentist, yes. 
 

Q: But the dental care wa
s probably pulling teeth. 
 

A: Probably they had to. I don™t know if
 they had Novocain even that time. 
 

Q: Yeah. We re there toilets there? 

 

A: Yes., and pretty near us wa
s the toilet. We  were the last room -- we were 191, and the last 
one was 190, and opposite was the toilet, so we 
didn™t have it far. I don™t reme mber being 
any problem with long lines, because we went 
late at night, maybe and we didn™t go at 
night, and the early morning because we had to
 go to work. So I don™t think we had such 
a problem. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
62 
 
 
Q: And-- 
 

A: There could be a line he
re and there you know, but -- 
 

Q: But you don™t reme mber  that? 

 

A: There™s alwa ys a line in ladies room, you know -- 

 

Q: Yes, I know. 

 

A: -- that when you go some where, so 
that™s about it, what we had too.  
 

Q: And when you were in the field, 
did people just go?  In the fields? 
 

A: Behind the tree. 

 

Q: Behind a tree. 

 

A: There were no toilets. 

 

Q: No, I imagine there was no outdoor toilets, right?  

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Was this very tiring work for you, or because you were eating more, were you less tired 
than you mi ght have been? 
 

A: We were tired because we really worked ha
rd, very, very ha rd, we
 were out on our feet 
all day -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- with the hoe, we had to turn ove
r the ground, we worked like me n. But you know, you 
are not really hungry, but because you don™t have
 it -- first of all, toma toes, you full your 
stomach and in half an hour you are hungr
y again. And because you don™t have it, if 
some body tells you can™t have more in a day than 
this, then it™s -- this is very small. So 

you do feel hunger. And we talked a lot about 
food, but we also heard a lot of requiem. 
My friend was singing in requiem, and while 
we were turning over the ma nure, she was 
singing what she learned the night before. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Was that good for everybody that she was singing? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
63 
 
 
A: Yes, yes, yes. We  were singing songs with
 her. She had a beautiful voice, and we knew 
what™s going on, and we were waiting for the 
production, and we all went to listen, and it 
was so uplifting that I co
uld never forget it.  
 
Q: And when you were talking -- well, we™ll 
talk about that mor e , but when -- when you 
were talking about food, 
you™re all young wome n -- 
 

A: We didn™t talk what we cook, what we like to
 eat and what we would order, and what we 
wanted to eat. 
 

Q: I see, what other people would have cooked for you. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: I didn™t know anything about cooking. 

 

Q: Was this -- 

 

A: What dessert you like best, 
what ice cream you like best. 
 

Q: Is this -- 

 

A: We always ate. 

 
Q: Did this ma ke you hungry, or was this helpful? 
 

A: I think it was helpful, we tried to tast e it in our mi nds. 

 

Q: Yeah, right. Now, did a -- 

 

A: We were not really that starved. I can™t
 say, because we did have some thing, but we 
didn™t see eggs for years, you know, so you were imagining how good eggs are. At one 

point they decided that they will have silkworm
s on a f -- there. So four of us girls, and I 
was among t hem, were responsible for the silkwo
rms, we ha d to feed them. We  had to go 
and look for mulberry trees, and a Ge rman wa
s comi ng with us. We  had to take all the 
mulberry leaves, put it in a bag, and then we
 came where they had the silkwor ms, and we 
fed them and cleaned out that. They were very
 nice, they were silky, the wor ms are very 

nice. And once it was in a farm, and the chicke
n lost her egg. Now we wer e  four girls, 
and we were trying to get the egg. What we 
would do with one egg for the four of us, I 
had no idea. But the -- the German saw it, and he
 picked it up, wouldn™
t let us pick it up, 
so we lost our egg. But th -- those were th
e things we were longing for that we didn™t 
have. We  ha d the soup, and the black coffee and bread, norma l meal. And some ti me s the 

dumplings with [indecipherable] a treat. But yo
u didn™t have variety, you didn™t -- so we -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
64 
 
 
- we dreamt about that, we were hungry for that
, but starving like they 
did in Poland or in 
-- in those camps, no. 
 
Q: Yeah. 

 

A: You see, I would pull out the 
carrot and eat it with the eart
h and everything on it, and -- 
 

Q: So you were really -- 

 

A: -- I got vitami ns. 

 

Q: Right, I was going to say 
you™ve got mi nerals, and -- 
 

A: Mm.  

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: And I bring it home, and I couldn™t tell my fa
ther, and we had to cheat him, and telling 
him that I got it as a reward, and I found it, 
and I -- I don™t know wh
at kind of excuses I 
found that he eats half a toma to. 
 

Q: The tape is running out, we
™re going to change tapes. 
 

A: I have to get up and get -- 

 

End of Tape #5

Q: I want to go back to the toma toes fo
r a mi nute. How -- when you carried a lot of 
toma toes, how ma ny could you carry? 
 

A: Well, the maximu m that we counted what
 I carried were 33 toma toes wrapped -- 
 

Q: In your bra? 

 

A: In my bra. 

 

Q: Now these are not bi g toma toes? 

 

A: Regular toma toes. They are not beefsteak toma toes. They are -- 

 

Q: 33?  Without breaking them?  

 

A: Without breaking them. 

 

Q: Did you have a very big bra? 

 

A: Empty bra, yes, very big, I had nothing there. But -- 

 

Q: Because it seems inconceivable to have 33 -- 

 

A: Once we found on the way, and we happenedto have a good gendarme with us, walnuts. 
But if you know the walnuts ar
e in a very prickly -- 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Well, we put them in bra, too, and we got burned from the acid. 

 

Q: You got burned from the acid. 

 

A: On our chest. 

 

Q: But it would also hurt -- 

 

A: Itdid. 

 

Q: -- beca use it -- 

 

A: But you would bring it in, that 
was some thing totally different. 
 

Q: Now I have to tell you, my vision of you w
ith 33 toma toes is the Berusky would come  
after you in a second because you would be so hu -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
66 
 
 
 
A: No, we had roll -- the clothing, I had my fath
er™s shirt, for exampl
e. I -- someti mes to 
work I had to have my father™s shoes in -- 
in winter, because I put newspaper -- paper, 
whatever we found in, because we were wo
rking cutting re -- reeds, and that was 
standing on ice, some times little water. A
nd I didn™t have such strong shoes like my 
father, and so he ma de me  wear them so
 I don™t get frostbite. So you -- you know, you -- 
I wore -- 
 

Q: [indecipherable] your father™s.  

 

A: -- my father™s shirt, I could put in anythi
ng. And when I worked w
ith my friends, I told 
you they worked four people on th
is little -- it was a li
ttle place where they had few fields 
of onions, she would give me  onion. The 
onion burned you too, ma de us brown if I 
brought onions home. But the onion was like gol
d, because that ma de any food better, if 
my mother just -- but I d
on™t know how often my  mother
 -- my mother always found 
some where some  wood, and would -- would ma
ke some thing in -- we had a little stove 
for heating the room, so you only got little left
overs of wood from the carpenters, so -- so 

she always would find some thi
ng to heat with. We were f
eeding pigs for example, one 
week it was our job, our group. We  were a grou
p that was put wherever they needed. And 
we stole the good potatoes from th
e pigs and gave the rottens 
only to them. So we always 
found some thing different to -- to eat, and to steal. 
 

Q: And how many were in this group? 

 

A: We were about 15 girls in the group, so
me ti me s 10, some ti me s 12, and was always the 
same  group. You kept together one group, a
nd you had a head of the group. And there 
were several groups together and the head of
 all the toma toes and everybody was We rner 
Neuflies who still living at age 
95 in Israel. And we are still 
very friendly, and he™s not 
writing now, so I don™t know what™s happeni
ng to him. But you had a leader, you had a 
group leader, and you were a group. Now, when th
ey needed to bring in hay, we had to 
all go and rake the hay and turn it over till 
it™s dry. Bundle it and s-
stick it up, and we had 
to carry the heavy bundles lik
e anybody else. But we were all young, we were all in our 
teens, and -- no, we w -- had wome n that were
 in their 30™s too, a
nd had children already, 
they -- so we were but still young people, so 
we could do it. And we had the vitami ns. 
 
Q: Was -- where there ma y -- comparable ma le groups, or were these -- 

 

A: There were some  ma le groups, but not fi
eld groups, not garden groups. Males were 
working with horses and different thi
ngs where wome n were not working.  
 

Q: Were any of you in these groups
 knowledgeable about farming? 
 

A: I think so. My friend came  from a far m, fo
r example. She still lives in Czechoslovakia, 
we see each other when we go there. She™s th
e one who was singing in the choir. She was 
from a far m, she knew about field work. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
67 
 
 
Q: So did -- did you learn -- 
 

A: When she was young -- she was younger thanI was, two years younger, but she still 
knew about it. The Prague girls didn™t know muc h. 
 

Q: So you had to learn quickly. 

 

A: We learned. We did -- it™s 
very easy, shows you what to do 
with toma toes, how to plant 
them once, and you do it. They show you how 
to ma ke the plate around so water keeps, 
and you do it. And then you got through all th
e rows all morning until you finish.  
 

Q: And you said in your group, you don™t know what
 other groups were like, but whatever 
food you took out, you shared. 
 

A: We shared. We had three older wo -- old 
wome n we called them, but as I say, they were 
in their 30™s and 40™s, who were very nervous, 
who didn™t want -- were not as risky. We  -
- we some how -- I don™t think we believedsome thing can happen to us, that™s the 

stupidity. And because they were so nervous, 
they didn™t know how to hide it, and they 
didn™t know how to behave in front of the genda
rmes, they would put us all at risk. So we 
decided, hey you don™t take anything, you go on the side, so you see you are free. And we 

will, when we get behind the door, we
 will divide it. And they agreed. 
 

Q: So it was very smart. 

 

A: Yeah, but -- was very smart. There were da
ys when we couldn™t 
take, we knew we can™t 
take because it was a very bad gendarme, and 
we  didn™t know what he will do at the -- at 
the gate. And so there we re days when we
 didn™t take anything, and when we had the 
feeling it will -- 
 

Q: So did you discuss this as
 you were in the field -- 
 

A: Ohyes. 

 

Q: -- and say, oh we think we should nothing. 

 

A: Oh yes, we worked together -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

 A.        A: -- we worked together as a group. We worked together, we did               
entertaining together. As a ma tter of fact
, the last -- on New Year™s Eve in 1944, we 
decided we will party, this is the end of the 
war, we -- two months and it™s ended. And I 

think we knew that the war 
is going bad for the Germans.
 So we decided -- we saw a 
room and there was -- used to be a stove -- 
by that time, don™t forget, after the transports 
in October, the ghetto was half empty, 
more than half                         we had a program. 
And I have the program, I didn™t -- I don™
t think I left it -- wrote it -- what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
68 
 
 
[indecipherable] each two or one ma de a -- 
a -- a -- like a number performe d, and we 
didn™t have anything to 
drink, but we  were like drunk, becaus
e we said we™ll be free, this 
is the year we will be fr ee. 
Q.      So you were there all night, partying. 
 

A.      All night partying, yea
h. Very quietly partyinh, nobody should hear. 
 

Q.  Right. 

 

A.  But we were together, we were very close knit group. 

 

Q.  Right. 

 

A.  But I think the others were, too, becaus
e I think it was a necessity, you have to work 
together, you couldn™t do it on your own.  
                                                                                                                               
                                                     

Q: So you didn™t hear fighting in the barrac
k, or pe ople yelling at each ot her, having 
arguments, or did you? 
 

A: Oh, some  wi nnen -- women mi ght have a argument that she threw down a piece of paper 
on her place, or ma ybe, but we were so littl
e in the room. And then I lived with my 
parents, there was no argume nt there, so -- 
 

Q: When -- when you first got this -- 

 

A: -- bickering, I would ca
ll it, not really fights. 
 

Q: Bickering, okay. When you first got there, th
is is before your pare
nts come, and you have 
a sort of substitute mo m -- 
 

A: Martha--MamaDittel. 

 

Q: -- do you -- Mama  Dittel -- do you have a f -- a 
feeling -- d-does it take away the -- some 
of the loneliness because  there™s some one there? 
 

A: Defi nitely,defi nitely. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And I had my boyfriend that I looked forward 
to see. We  did part, afterwards, but I had 
him there, too, so -- and -- and I felt freer 
in one way, I had no -- th
e people that looked at 
us differently, I didn™t meet th
e others. We  were among ours e lves only, I felt much fr eer. 
I felt better. And I felt that when it is over in
 two months, I have my room, and my bed, 
and our apartment and my parents. They are st
ill home. I felt privileged that they™re -- I 
was -- by that time  I wa s happy that they di
dn™t come . But was the bubble blew and they 
came, but --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
69 
 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- which was again, I was happy to see them, I was unhappy that they had to come . But at 
that time, the fi rst few months, I felt priv
ileged that I have still my bed at home . 
 

Q: So there was a si -- 

 

A: I don™t know why the bed was so important
, because I think the bunkbed wasn™t very 
comfortable. 
 

Q: But there was a sense of outside security, 
because the war will be over, so you™ll ha ve a 
place, and here it™s not so bad yet. 
 

A: Yes. You know -- 

 

Q: Because you at least have -- yes? 

 

A: -- we -- my friend had scarlet fever, my othe
r friend had typhoid fever, and I thought if I -
- we slept together on the bunk so
 I mi ght get it too, and then I can™t get into transports. 
The transports were hanging over you all the ti
me . You would be rather sick than getting 
into transport. But I never got it. 
 

Q: You never got sick? 

 

A: No. There was diphthe ria, there was encepha
litis, there was he patitis, there was scarlet 
fever. What else was there? 
 

Q: Dysen-- 

 

A: Dysentery. I was always h
ealthy. I think the vitamins di
d it. But o -- even in the 
beginning when I didn™t have them. 
 

Q: So you were very strong, ther
e was some thing in your system. 
 

A: Probably. Because in the end when we were 
liberated, friend of mi ne came  as the first 
transpor t that  came, where we for the fi rst 
time  realized what happened, where we saw 
for the first time -- we called them musselm
an, those devastated 
people that looked like 
skeleton. We tried to feed them. We  were th
ree girls that volunteer
ed to -- imme diately 
we had to take care of them, and eve r ybody was mobilized to do some thing for that 

effort. Forget the garden, and -- but s -- do 
some thing for these people. They cooked the 
soup, but -- whatever they did, and they brought
 it and we were supposed to dish it out. 
And they all swa mped around us, and the whol
e kettle and everything was down. We  had 
one girl that was like a general,
 and of course they broke an
other kettle and she screamed 
at them. They all -- you know, they were afraid
 of screaming. We  didn™t want to do that. 
We got them -- she helped us to get it. We  saw them like animals and -- and that was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
70 
 
 
terrible for us. And with the fi rst came -- th
e fi rst women, there was my fr iend with her 
mother. And she was sick so she was in th
e -- in the teepho -- t
yphoid barracks. But it 
was open, I could go in and out. So -- and she 
called for me  a nd from the window I saw. I 
said, ﬁWhat do you want? ﬂ  And she told me , 
I don™t know, piece of bread or whatever. I 
ran home and brought it, and I just walked into the typhoid hospital 
and I brought it to 
them, you know, stuff. Then I went outs -- we
 had outside hothouses
, you know, for stuff, 
and we had all this vegetables there, so 
I brought some  veggies to them, some thing to 
nibble on, and nobody stopped me , could in and 
out as I wanted, and I did. And some  
people got sick, I didn™t.  
 
Q: It™s really quite amazing. 

 

A: I didn™t know. I -- I was not 
afraid to get sick and I d -- 
I -- I never thought I could get 
sick. When I think of it today when I ha
ve a little sense, it™s different.  
 

Q: You had some  sort of immunity -- 

 

A: Probably. 

 

Q: -- who knows?  Who knows? 

 

A: Probably. 

 

Q: Bef -- be -- when you were y -- there 
before your parents came , did you have bad 
dreams?  Do you reme mb er at any time ha
ving bad dreams, having nightma res?   
 
A: Opposite. I was dreaming being home.  
 

Q: You s -- 

 

A: And it hurt in the morning more when I woke up around. 

 

Q: Because you were in a different place. 

 

A: They are not bad dreams. Bad dreams  I had afterwards, not there. 

 

Q: Uh-huh.Right. 

 

A: Not there. I was always dreaming I™m back at
 ho me. Because that was -- I -- I wanted my 
parents to keep the apart -- 
I wanted home , you know, we wa nt
ed to be liberated, and we 
thought life will continue  where it stopped, 
but it didn™t, and that was the biggest 
disappointment, and it took out all the pleasure of being liberated -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- because it was not -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
71 
 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- what we were -- we thought will be. 

 

Q: Right. Your parents arrived -- 

 

A: End of -- 

 

Q: ™43? 

 

A: No, ™42 -- 

 

Q: No, ™42 -- end of ™42. 

 

A: End of ™42. ™43 I was already in agricu
lture. ™43 they were 
there. End of ™42. 
 

Q: So you™re there July ™42 -- 

 

A: [indecipherable]th
ere end of Nove mber. 
 

Q: And they™re -- they come  -- 

 

A: Four months  later, some thing like that.  

 

Q: Four months  later. 
 
A: Yeah. Four and a half months, it™s about that time.  

 

Q: So, to the beginning of ™43 -- 

 

A: End of ™42. 

 

Q: -- or the end of ™42. End of ™42. Ok
ay. You didn™t know they were comi ng? 
 

A: No, but as soon as my boyfriend got -- he wo
rking with the transports
 he got the list, he 
saw them on the list, he came  to tell me  your
 parents are here. And then he took me  over 
to them, he smuggled me  in. Because nobody wa
s allowed to come , but those boys that 
worked with the transport could, and he got me in. So I saw them still in the Schleusse, 

and imme di ately I put on my mother that I wa
nt them in the -- want her in Ha mburger. 
My brother and my father went
 to the barracks they were as
signed to. My father -- I -- 
immediately there was a transp
ort going to Poland, and I was afraid they would go, so 
imme diately my father contacted his friend 
who was on the Altesten
rat, on the council of 
the elders. 
 

Q: And who wa s that, do you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
72 
 
 
 
A: Zucker, his name was Zucker. 

 

Q: And so he™s he deputy dir
ector un-underneath Eidelstein? 
 

A: Yeah. And he ma de sure that he
 stayed. And he gave him the job. 
 

Q: So he got a job [indecipherable] 

 

A: Not right away, but he -- he
 stayed -- the transport I think 
went -- I™m not sure when the 
transport -- early in Januar
y or end of Dece mber. I -- I 
don™t know when the transport 
went exactly, I could check on th
at. And he ma de sure he stayed, and then he gave him 
the job to make order, to ma ke
 sure. My father had a vision 
that if nobody steals from the 
main -- I -- I stole from the Germans, but he
 didn™t [indecipherable]
 stealing either . So 
stealing is stealing. 
 

Q: No ma tter fro m who m.  

 

A: No ma tter from whom. If -- as long as 
everybody will eat his portions, then these ol d 
people that were dying would 
get enough food, too. There wa s 
some truth in it, but I 
don™t think he realized that ma ybe the young pe
ople need more food than the older one, 
and the kids need more food. He wanted jus
tice for everyone, and he worked very hard 
on that. But he was very generous. All of hi
s friends and everybody got a good job there, 
too, as long as he could take care of them. 
 

Q: Hm. But there™s always -- 
 
A: There was the end. He went with the last 
transport when all the 
-- when all the -- the 
whole f -- Alteste and everybody was gone, so he
 -- he couldn™t stay any more. Zucker 
was gone, and I don™t know what happened, w
hy he was taken. There was a group of 20 
young boys taken by Heindel, out. That™s why they wanted me  as a witness against 

Heindel. They were taken off the -- you know
 where you get on -- in
to the train. They 
were not in the train, yet -- on the -- 
 

Q: On the ramp . 

 

A: On the ramp . And my father was among them
, but he wasn™t in his 20™s, he was 50 years 
old -- fi -- 50 thr -- 54 years old. And they t
ook them to the small fortress and they were 
the ones -- which I found -- we found only af
terwards, and we found his name  on the 
small fortress too, and they were the ones that
 had to clean out the crematorium from all 
the urns, and throw them into the river. And last time when we were there, there is a 

me morial for these 20 me n, and where they th
rew down the -- the ashe
s into the river. 
And according to Elna Haas, he was about six 
weeks, and then they executed all of them, 
all 20. 
 

Q: After they™d fi nished this. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
73 
 
 
 
A: Evidently. So that -- I 
found that out from Elna. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And Mother -- that was the 20
th
 of October. Mother went 
to Auschwitz and didn™t pass 
the selection. She was 51, that was too old 
for them. My friend™s mother that passed 
because she was with her, she said that sh
e is 40 years old. She was the sa me  age, 50 
about, and that she™s my  friend™s sister. And 
because she was naked then -- and she said 
she had so ma ny children, that™s why she -- she 
lost a lot of weight
, and she survived.  
 

Q: This was Ma ma  Dittel? 

 

A: Mama Dittel. 

 

Q: When your parents came, and your mother 
is living with you, a
nd then your f -- your 
father is in Sudeten, do you thi -- 
 

A: Yeah, and my brother, too. 

 

Q: -- for -- for awhile before -- and your brothe
r too. Do they come  and say that they have 
some  idea of what™s going on in Poland?  Or don™t? 
 

A: No[indecipherable] 

 

Q: They don™t know anything, and they™re not h
earing -- or they™re not
 telling you what they 
know?  
 

A: We knew what™s going on in Poland little
 bit, because everybody, wherever you got the 
30 [indecipherable] and as I said one of Mothe
r™s best friend, we called her aunt, wrote to 
her, in a way she wrote that it™
s awful, and the only thing that™s good for her is the mi rror. 
So we knew that she had little 
bit of money that she could us
e in the ghetto. That was the 
mi rror my father made for everyone. 
 

Q: Right. And she was in wudge -- Lódz -- 

 

A: Izbica. 

 

Q: Oh, she™s in be -- Iz
bica, right, right, right. 
 

A: From my real aunt I never 
got -- we never got news, we ne
ver -- she went -- according to 
the book, I think they we nt to Sobibór, stra
ight from Terezín, they never went to 

Auschwitz or anywhere. 
 

Q: Now, does it surprise you that 
you™re not hearing rumors by ™43? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
74 
 
 
A: We knew it™s very bad, everybody was afraid 
to go east. We  knew the Polish people were 
very bad to the people. That was some
how known, that the Polish people are not 
sympathetic to the Jews.  
 
Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: We knew that the Jews are su
ffering, that they are beaten 
and killed, and -- and we knew 
about concentration camp. But there is still 
the belief that if you do and work hard, and 
do what they say, they let you live. We didn™
t believe in ma ss extermination. We  thought 
in masses is strength, and they can™t kill 
hundred people at the same  ti me . How dumb. 
They could kill si x million. 
 

Q: Mm. So your parents, I assume
, are somewhat less optimistic than they were before they 
come? 
 

A: But in front of us kids -- 

 

Q: They™re the same. 

 

A: -- they were always talking, it will be 
ending soon, you will have a norma l life, you have  
to survive. Their aim was  that their kids surv
ive, they didn™t care much about themselves. 
My parents lost a lot of weight, even though we 
tried to bring and steal, they never take a 
thing, you know, from a nywhere or anything. 
So we kids were the ones. My brother 
worked in the bakery and would bring addi
tional bread, and -- whic
h he would give his 
par -- our parents, and 
they lost a lot of weight. My 
father was a little belly, and you 
know, he looked well-to-do, you will see it 
on the movie, and he was very skinny 
afterwards, and my mother too. And that we
nt very fast. And I was bringing home the 
stuff, so you know, that didn™t help, to [i ndecipherable] they were healthy people. 

Otherwise, there was nothing wrong with them. 
And they -- they considered themselves 
old, and lived their life, although th
ey was only in their early 50™s. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther work? 

 

A: Beforethewar? 

 

Q: No, no, no, no, when she was in Terezín -- 

 

A: Ohyes. 

 

Q: -- when she same to -- 

 

A: Oh yeah. She started with the Putzkolonne 
like Edgar™s mother, like everyone. When new 
people come they start the worst jobs becau
se once you are there for a little while, you 
find a way to find some thing bett
er. My father didn™t start on th
at note, he started in some  
office or something. But my mother started in
 the Putzkolonne with 
washing floors, and -
- and I don™t know where they all cleaned, and 
I have no idea, because I was gone for the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
75 
 
 
day. And then -- for a long time she was very 
handicapped with her -- 
she got a terrible 
attack of sciatica nerve and 
she couldn™t -- she could onl
y lay down, she couldn™t move 
for weeks. Because there was no me dication, 
nothi ng, no pain killers, nothing. So only 
time would heal. And then finally I -- she got
 onto a bed so she could rest better. And 
then it stopped slowly, and she started to 
work. So for some time she was incapacitated. 
 

Q: Were you concerned that she would be 
transported out if 
she was incapaci --  
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Youweren™t? 

 

A: No, no, that -- I wasn™t, because I believe
d in my  father. We  believe d Father can do 
anything too, like my grandma.  
 

Q: And because he was in a sort of priv
ileged position by then, could he protect your 
mother?  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: You -- he could? 

 

A: And they also went together. 

 

Q: Later -- no, I -- yes, I understand. 

 
A: Because of that -- 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And at that time , I knew th
at if sh -- if I get her into -- there was a man that was 
responsible, Edgar wanted me  to tell you, fo
r the agriculture, his name  wa s Kurzawy. He 
was not an SS, and he was really very good to us. When the SS came he was -- he would 

call us all dirty name s, and scream at us, a
nd when the SS went he would said, ﬁOkay, it™s 
norma l again.ﬂ You know?  He would always prot
ect us if he could. He was a great guy. 
In 1945, he was imprisoned like all the Germans, 
in the small fortress, and the agriculture 
group got together and signed a petition and we
 got him out. And he ended up his life in 
Austria. But he was great, so I thought ma ybe I -- my sister-in-law some times worke d in 

his pri -- private garden in his house, it was 
outside the ghetto. So I 
thought we -- I could 
get my mother in to be protected, but my 
mother wouldn™t let me , she said, ﬁAh, you are -
- your father and me , we are toge ther. We  
will go through this together. You have been 
here before alone, you can survive again, a
nd you have to surviv
e.ﬂ And she wouldn™t 
[indecipherable] 
 

Q: She wouldn™t [indecipherable] 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
76 
 
 
A: -- she wouldn™t s -- try to save herself, no. 
And I tried to get in, but
 they wouldn™t take us. 
We were 29 girls that appealed to everyone
 we could, including Murmelstein, who threw 
us out very rudely, that wanted
 to make a swap, 15 girls take
 in and 15 parents take out, 
you know, swap it, it™s nu mber for number. No. Because it was a rule that we have to 
bring in the harvest, that -- a
nd that what Kurzawy did. None 
of his girls were allowed to 
be send away. He needs them for ha
rvest, and that he saved everyone. 
 

Q: So do you now think Murmelstein in some  
way, even though he was not the nicest of 
persons, that he ended up
 saving the girls life? 
 

A: I think he did it -- I don™t think he cared, I 
don™t believe that he care
d. I think he did what 
was the order from the commandant. 
 

Q: So these people -- 

 

A: And the order was not to send 
anybody who works in the fields. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And[indecipherable] 

 

Q: Because they couldn™t substitute the older people for you. 

 

A: Yeah. So I think that was his, and as a ma
tter of fact, Kurzawy told me  -- I went to him 
too, and he will talk to us. But he said, 
ﬁYou wi -- you won™t be with your mother, and 
you will be grateful to me that
 I saved your life.ﬂ And I said to him, ﬁI don™t ask you for 
that. I want to go.ﬂ And he said, ﬁYou will not 
go.ﬂ That was the end. So then in Februa ry 

came a Swis s transport. And I happened to be in
 the Swiss transport ti -- again. By that 
time [indecipherable] could go, that was alre
ady the end comi ng. And I decided if he 
didn™t let me go with my parents, I™m not l
eaving Terezín because my
 parents will come  
back to Terezín. I don™t want to be some where 
in Switzerland. Besides, it™s probably goes 
to the se nt -- to Birkenau. Birkenau we 
knew -- to Birkenau two, and I do -- I™m not 
going anywhere now. So I went to Kurzawy 
and he said, ﬁIt™s going to Switzerland, I™m 
telling you.ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t be
lieve you, I want to stay.ﬂ He
 said, ﬁYou can stay.ﬂ And I 
stayed. Took me  out of the transpor
t. But that went to Switzerland 
 

Q: That really went to [indecipherable] 

 

A: That really went, but I 
didn™t trust them any more.  
 

Q: Okay, we have to change the tape again. 

 

End of Tape #6

Tape #7 
 
Q: Hana, when Heindel said to you, you will be gr ateful to me  -- 

 

A: Kurzawy, not Heindel. 
Heindel would never -- 
 

Q: Oh, of course, kur -- s -- I™m sorry -- 

 

A: -- talk to us. 

 

Q: Kur -- kur -- 

 

A: Kurzawy. 

 

Q: Kurzawy-- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- said that you would be grateful 
to me , cause -- that™s you™re alive.  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you then un -- realize that for every -- 

 

A: I think we understood that it™s very ba
d on the other side. What we didn™t know, and I 
didn™t know that he was in sh -- Auschwitz 
once, that he was there, he saw what 
happening. 
 

Q: So he knew? 

 

A: He knew, but I didn™t know 
it until my sister-in-law told me
 years later that he was sent 
to Auschwitz as one of the transports, and he saw. 
 

Q: And then he ca -- and then -- 

 

A: And that™s when he decide
d to save his groups, and his -- 
the girls he worked with, I 
think. We  think, we don™t know. 
 

Q: So it only seemed to you that he was saying 
it™s -- one can be very vulnerable there, wa s 
not -- 
 

A: It™s ve ry bad there, there™s -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- you know, much more hunger, there 
is much more -- we knew that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
78 
 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: And it™s under the SS -- 

 

Q: right. 

 

A: -- very, very bad, you know. And we knew that
 the camps were wors
e -- the ghettos in -- 
Lódz ghetto was much wors
e sanitary and everything, that we knew. Everybody was 
afraid of the east, because the Polish people 
suffered before the war, with pogroms. They 
didn™t need the war for that.  
 

Q: I™m asking this only because it™s -- it™s -- 

 

A: But nobody believed that -- 

 

Q: I know, I understand. 

 

A: -- some body can do such a thing to huma n beings. 

 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: To children.  

 

Q: Yeah. 

 
A: To young people, old people. Nobody believed it. I was so upset when grandma died 
because I thought it™s my fault, I should have
 take n better care of her, which I didn™t 
know what to do, how I would have been able, 
because they were dying at that time , the -
- the book it says 220, I thought about 150 a day 
in ™42, in summer. That was the worst 
summer for death rate in Terezín. And after th
e wa r I said I™m so grateful that she did, 
because they schlepped the old people to Au
schwitz, they died on the way in the train. 
She was spared that, she died in a bed. 
You know?  And she was 86 or 88, I don™t know. 
So for her it was a good deed. But I -- we kne
w it™s very bad, that
 we knew. Why would 
everybody fight not to go? 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: Terezín wasn™t a bargain. 

 

Q: Yes, right. But the real -- what
 was really happening, no one was -- 
 

A: The gas chamber we didn™t know. 

 

Q: -- no one had any suspicion. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
79 
 
 
A: And we didn™t know that 50 is old. My 
mother said, ﬁLook, I am strong, I am still good 
enough to work, I can work hard and I™ll come  back.ﬂ She didn™t. 
 
Q: Shedidn™t. 

 

A: Was too old. 

 

Q: I want to ask you some  about, not only the 
requiem concert, but also other artistic and 
musical and theater activity.  
 

A: We went to anything we could get our ha
nds on tickets, or whatever they get. I saw 
Brundibar. I saw Bartibride. I saw all -- some  operas. 
 

Q: Did you see, ﬁMarriage of Figaroﬂ? 

 

A: No, that one I didn™t see. 

 

Q: ﬁCarme nﬂ? 

 

A: ﬁCarme nﬂ I saw. I saw -- I went to near
ly any concert [indeciph
erable] to get on Alice 
Sommer-Herz, which was the pi anist I loved so much. 
 

Q: What was her name -- was her name? 

 

A: Alice Sommer-Herz. She™s the hund
red year old one, and -- and -- 
 
Q: Ahundred? 
 

A: -- I would listen to her, b
ecause sh -- to -- she played the Mozart, she played Chopin, and 
I loved that. So I would try to get to these c
oncerts, but they we re not
 only concert -- as a 
ma tter of fac t , we did some  recitals of poe
ms, because a guy, usually Geor ge Loy put us, 
about six gi rls together, and we recite, just
 to do some thing, because we couldn™t sing. 
But that wasn™t too -- too successful -- 
 

Q: Itwasn™t? 

 

A: -- cause people didn™t listen to poems  
too much, s o after short while it -- it stopped 
[indecipherable]. But we wanted to do thi
ngs, because that -- that took away the 
boredom. 
 

Q: Did you have to pay for these tickets? 

 

A: With your ghetto gelt.  

 

Q: And what was ghetto gelt?  Th
ere was actually mo ney printed? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
80 
 
 
A: Actual money that you get for your work. 
We  played Monopoly. My sister-in-law made 
Monopoly board, I don™t know where she got th
e cardboard, and with this money we 
played Monopoly sometimes. 
 
Q: Really? 

 

A: Yeah. But I don™t know what happened to it
. She said all she ha
s left is about two 
calendars that she ma de for birthdays. Y
ou get -- you -- you paid with some thing, like 
toma toes, and you -- she ma de you a -- you know, a some thing else, and the person made 

you whatever you ordered. 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: I have a pendant that I got in ™43 on my birthday. 

 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah, we have it with us. Edgar didn™
t show you his pendant in those pictures. He 
has one too, different. It has 
his -- his number, transport 
number in the Akar, and mi ne 
has my transport number and the date on it. 
It ™s fro m scrap me tal, it™s not silver  -- 
 

Q: [indecipherable] 

 

A: -- it™s not gold, it™s
 just [indecipherable] 
 

Q: -- it has a different kind of value. 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Yes. Did ma ny, ma ny people go to
 these events, or a small -- 
 

A: It was always full. 

 

Q: It was always full. 

 

A: I don™t know how many people go twice or thre
e times. Because it was also hard to get 
tickets, there was too ma ny people that wanted
 to go, because that was -- for the two 
hours, an hour and a half, you forgot you were where you were. The music was -- well, 

I™m not a musician, but I s -- would say perf
ect. That was -- anywhere else the conc ert 
could be held, and would be great. She wa
s a great pianist, so you know, I™m not a good -
- ma ybe some body would say the pi
ano wasn™t tuned very well,
 but -- and there were too 
-- big competition, you -- some ti me s you knew 
some body who could get the tickets or 

you -- you really bargained for that, but you got
 tickets, you went. I don™t reme mber how 
it was later, because in the beginning you also
 ha d to be eight o™clock ho me . Whether for 
Freizeit we were allowed, becau
se this was all evenings.

Q: FreizeitwasFriday? 
 

A: The free -- 

 

Q: Freeday. 

 

A: No, Freizeit means that was the fr
ee entertainment, or whatever -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh,uh-huh. 

 

A: -- you know, and that you got permission to 
go later out, I don™t 
know, but I know that 
there was a -- from eight to 
five, you were not allowed to be on the streets, but you had to 

get home from those performa nces, so that mi ght have been allowed. 
 

Q: I just thought of some thing that ma y seem
 stupid. Ho -- how were your barracks lit at 
night?  With what?  Candles? 
 

A: No, there was electricity. 

 

Q: There was li -- there was electricity. 

 

A: Electricity. There was only no heat. There 
was no heat or hot water. I don™t know how 
they had it in the kitchen, but in the washr
oom, where Edgar ad -- des-described it, where 
we went every night to
 wash, and sit under -- 
 

Q: There™sno-- 
 
A: -- the cold water -- 

 

Q: --hi-- 

 

A: -- yeah, there was 
no hot water there. 
 

Q: You sat under the cold -- 

 

A: No, you -- you jumped onto the [indecipherable] 

 

Q: Yes? 

 

A: -- and sat down and opened the pipe, a
nd -- and that was your shower. There was no 
shower. 
 

Q: You had towels? 

 

A: We had towels from home , sure. That wa
s in the hun -- 50 kilos, in the 110 pounds. You 
had towels, you had bed linen in that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
82 
 
 
 
Q: And then you sent this out to be cl -- washed? 

 

A: Only the big things you could send out to 
be washed, like the bed linen and the towels. 
Your -- your things, you washed in the cold 
water. You had a basin that you shared. 

[indecipherable] 
 

Q: And you wa shed that. And where would you hang it? 

 

A: Above your bed. 

 

Q: So it would drip down? 

 

A: You hang it this way, they didn™t drip 
down. [indecipherable] where you could. Also 
between the windows outside. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: Wherever you could. 

 

Q: But in the cold weather 
-- really cold weather -- 
 

A: Yeah, it would be -- 

 

Q: -- it would -- it -- it would freeze. 

 
A: So you didn™t wash that day. 
 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: I don™t know how we did it. 
I don™t know things of ordinary
, we didn™t have paper, we  
didn™t have pencils, only what
 you brought in. But then those 
people that work with it, 
the painters, they got it, they mi ght have
, you know, some  may k -- have come  to their 
friends, or again exchanged the barter system. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: But paper was very valuable. 

 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: There was no toilet paper, I don™
t reme mber ever 
getting a ration. 
 

Q: Of toilet paper. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
83 
 
 
A: And any hygiene, there was no hygiene. But we
 all ar-are s -- young girls, did not have 
period for those three years. 
 
Q: You never got your period in 
Theresienstadt -- Te rezín. 
 

A: You entered the ghetto, it stopped.  

 

Q: It stopped. You know it™s interesting, becau
se ma ny wome n will tell you when they went 
to a concentration camp it stoppe
d. But they forget that they ma y not have gotten it in the 
ghetto. 
 

A: No, it stopped in the ghetto. 

 

Q: Itstopped. 

 

A: And-- 

 

Q: And you had obviously -- 

 

A: -- which was lucky, because we had no way of getting -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- anything. It started only when we came b
ack to Prague. I don™t know when, I mean --  
 

Q: Right. 
 
A: -- never thought about that. 

 

Q: Well, it was fortunate that it stopped.  

 

A: Well, evidently. Which we didn™t think of
 at that time. We just forgot about it 
[indecipherable] 
 

Q: Were -- was anybody worried that they
 weren™t getting their period?  No. 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: That was the least of your worries. But you re
 -- you never got it? So imme diately?  So it 
wasn™t that you were ge
tting less food. Because -- 
 

A: Well, it was the fi rst three or 
four weeks and nothing happened -- 
 

Q: Nothinghappened. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
84 
 
 
A: -- and that wa s it. You didn™t worry about
 health those days, we were young, we thought 
we are -- nothing can touch us. 
 
Q: It means you™re invulnerable. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Was the Verdi Requiem one of th
e most important concerts for you? 
 

A: Yes,yes. 

 

Q: And why was that the case? 

 

A: The most i mpact, the mo st -- because we 
-- I at least knew what they are singing about 
because my friend told me . She was singing 
for us, she was with Schecter. She knew 

what [indecipherable], and I took Latin in sc
hool, don™t forget I went to school from - -  
 

Q: That™sright. 

 

A: -- sixth grade I had Latin. So I knew what libera ma y mean, e-even if I didn™t understand 
every word, and couldn™t translate 
it for anybody, I didn™t know that much. 
 

Q: And what did -- 

 

A: It was very powerful. 

 
Q: And what did it mean for you? 
 

A: I thought I am back in Prague in a concer
t scene. So [indecipherable]. You -- you forget 
where you are that -- those two hours, you -- 
you hear the mus i c, you hear the concerts, 
you hear the opera [indecipherable] it was 
only singing, there was no acting, there was no 
stage. I mean, there was a stage where they
 s -- were standing and the piano and only 
singing. And you were back in th
e National Theater hearing the 
opera. I mean all in am -- 
imagination was great. 
 

Q: So it was -- but all of the performa nc es 
that you heard were important, wa s the requiem 
particularly important some
ho w?  Or was it more -- 
 

A: I think so. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: I think so because it -- some how our -- my friend told me  what  the meaning is, to tell 
them that they will suffer. In the end, trut
h will wi n some how, and we wanted to believe  
that. You know it was very interesting, I thought
 I could kill any SS with cold blooded. In 
™45 when they started -- when 
they ma rched them, they were torn, they were dirty, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
85 
 
 
were not these spic, span w
ith these high boots SS. I suddenl
y didn™t hate them so much, 
I couldn™t. They looked so vulnerable. I don™
t think I could have killed anybody, and -- 
even though I thought I could. 
 
Q: So they became  people again in some  way? 

 

A: In some  way they looked worse than we 
did. But in 1947 I went to England, and on the 
way back, I -- I brought some  oranges. I had 
a one year old nephew, my brother had a 

child with my sister-in-law, my friend. 
And on the all -- the all -- we went through 
Nuremberg which was all destroyed, and I en
joyed that very much. And under -- in the 
station we stopped, and I had these oranges, a
nd chocolate in my trunk that my friend -- I 
called her cousin, gave me  for everybody. And they were begging for food, those 

children. And I said, ﬁNo way do I give you Ge
rman children anything.ﬂ Like if those 
kids murdered all the others, but I could l
ook at them begging for food, a nd I didn™t feel 
guilty at all. And I know I wa
s awful, I know I -- I™m biased
 all my life, and not good, but 
I just couldn™t get rid of it
 at that time, ™47 was too early after the war. Now I am 
different. 
 

Q: Do you remember the preparations for 
the Red Cr oss visit in June of ™44? 

 

A: Yes, yes, because our group again, being 
put anywhere we™re needed, was put on the 
ma in square to do the grass. And it was al
l done, we had to clear everything away, new 
earth had to come . There was nothing, there wa
s just mud and stones. We had to clear it 
of stones, which was heavy work, several tim
es. The earth had to be brought in and 
turned over, and put in lime  a
nd stuff that -- to grass to grow
. And then we had to seed it, 
and then we had to stamp it by -- by -- see, we worked days and days and days on 
fershernerone we called it beautification. And then when they did the film, we had to 
ma rch because we -- we looked healthy, because we had the ve getabl es. We had to ma rch 

with our hoes, and shovels on our shoulder. A
nd ma rch in front of the came ra, and pick 
up the cake, and then behind the corner, we had to put the cake back on, and a new tray 

was brought in. Nobody could take a bite. That wa
s just a little some thing that we had to 
pick up. 
 

Q: This is the film -- 

 

A: That Hitler ma de -- Hitler
 gave a ghetto to -- a city
 to the Jews , or whatever. 
 

Q: To the Jews. But it was never ac
tually [indecipherable] the Jews. 
 

A: Yeah, the film that they showed, we -- we 
saw part of it, we saw our f -- one of our 
fr iends in it. But the agriculture walking ther
e, they never showed that. They said there 
are parts mi ssing.  
 

Q: And that was mi ssing. 

 

A: Maybe they didn™t pu
t it in, I don™t know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
86 
 
 
 
Q: They never completed it as far as I know. 

 

A: Yeah, ma ybe they didn™t put it in, 
it mi ght be it™s lost. I wouldn™t know. 
 

Q: So you were watching also, while you were -- while you were -- 

 

A: We knew what they are doing. 

 

Q: What they were doing. 

 

A: We knew what they are doing. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: The shops were being introduced, the shops we
re being staffed. My mother was put in the 
food shop, where she was selling mustard and 
relish, that™s all they had. But it was a 
change, I loved mustard and bread, and 
that was the [indecipherable] delicacy. 
 

Q: So it went on long enough, so actually people liv
ing in the ghetto could go into that store 
and get -- 
 

A: Yes, they -- yes, yes -- 

 

Q: -- if they had gelt. 

 
A: -- it was -- it -- it took time to esta
blish that it took time till the grass gr ew. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: Then we had to cut it to -- to 
-- you know, to ma ke sure it looks good. 
 

Q: And could every -- 

 

A: Have the flower planted t
oo, flowers. There were -- it wa
s ma de beautiful. They were 
putting up -- one space was for the gazebo fo
r the musicians or some thing. And on the 
day of the inspection, I was in 
the fields working, I was not in town. We  were rarely in 
town during the day, because once the grass grew
 and was finished, we went back to the 
fields, cause those had to be taken care of, 
and the summer is still most work. So on the 
day of th -- I never saw the -- 
 

Q: The Red Cross. 

 

A: -- people, the Red Cross or anybody. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
87 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm, okay. Now, during th
at period before the Red Cro
ss visit, could anyone who had 
free time walk in that area and go into the s
hops? Or was that a rest
ricted area to only 
certain people?   
 
A: It was a restricted area, it was in the mi
ddle of the town, and I don™t know when the shops 
opened exactly, but once they were opene
d, I think you could go 
in. I don™t think -- I 
don™t know how early before that they opened it, 
but in the ghetto, was no restricted area. 
I have no idea how it was during 
the exi -- actual inspection, wh
ether they restricted the 
main street where they walked, because I was outside. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I wasn™t there.  

 

Q: Now, it™s a few months -- well, it™s four 
months, June, July, August, September -- five 
months after this visit, that
 your parents and brother are de
ported. Are you living together 
during this period, or have you wi 
-- now been separated?  Are you -- 
 

A: Until they were deported, I stayed in the room with them. 

 

Q: You stayed with them. 

 

A: My brother next house. When 
they -- by the time they left, in
 the last transport, there wa s 
nobody in the house, I wa s all 
alone in the whole house. 
 

Q: Really? 
 
A: And my sister-in-law was 
in another house around the corn
er, and she was alone, too. So 
first we moved in together. I moved over there,
 I -- I didn™t want to stay in -- in that 
room, I -- I had nightmares, I was -- I wasn™t afra
id of anything, I was 
afraid to stay there 
alone. I tried to save few of the things. 
When you went to Auschwitz, you were allowed 
your backpack and what you can carry, no more 
a trunk, that stayed all with me , the three 
trunks. My brother™s things too. And then 
the agriculture departme nt opened a house 
right opposite where we had the place where we
 gathered for work. And my sister-in-law 
imme diately, through her supervisor, got a room fo
r us there. So we were five girls that 
moved in into that house in one room. I don™t 
remember the fifth, my
 sister-in-law says 
we were five, I reme mb er only four. 
 

Q: Let me ask you something, I know this -- I 
know how difficult this is for you to talk 
about. But y-you assume d that you
r parents were protected. 
 

A: Until they weren™t. 

 

Q: Until they weren™t. And at a certai n point, I guess, the people who were protected st opped 
being protected, they just -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
88 
 
 
A: They all went, and I knew there is no help by that time . 
 

Q: By that time . 

 

A: Because once my father says, ﬁWe have to go,ﬂ I knew that. 

 

Q: And did -- you obviously spoke to your brothe
r before he left . He was the first one to go, 
he left on a different tran
sport than your parents. 
 

A: He left on a different trans
port, and my sister-in-law says 
they got ma rried the day before, 
I thought always they got ma rried the same  da
y he left. That was a period of time when 

me  and my sister-in-law were
 jealous of each othe r. She™s 18, I am 20. So, you know, you 
don™t -- 21 -- you don™t -- 
 

Q: Get ma rried first if you™re younger, isn™t that -- 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: You -- not that -- 

 

Q: Oh,oh. 

 

A: -- that didn™t bother me , mi  -- ma rried my 
father -- my brother, not anybody I wanted. But 
she would claim my brot her more, and she w
ould claim that she knows him better. Now I 
lived with him, he was a little baby, I know hi
m better. So in Terezín we were bickering 
to, and fighting, and all that. When we came back and my brother returned, he was not in 

a very good condition that time , because he weigh like 90 pounds, 80 pounds, he was 

very skinny. He had the boils like Edgar. 
Didn™t look very good. But the first thing he 

said, ﬁI don™t want to hear my wi fe what 
she says, and I don™t want to hear you. We  a r e 

now the only fa mily [indecipherable] and you 
will get along. And that™s
 it, don™t come  to 
me.ﬂ So we didn™t. 
 

Q: That was [indecipherable] 

 

A: We got along, we had to get along, but not 
willingly. We  love each othe r now, and I™m so 
happy when I see -- have to see each other ever
y year at least. She was just here now. So 
she left Monday, the day you came he re. 
 

Q: And -- is that true, uh-huh. 
And Honza also was deported. 
 

A: He was deported -- 

 

Q: Earlier? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
89 
 
 
A: -- in the third transpor t, we -- we separated. 
 

Q: Before. 

 

A: Before, because I wasn™t ready 
to be  a true fiancé or whatever
. I wasn™t really ready for it. 
And he wanted more experience, 
let™s put it that wa y, as a boy. 
 

Q: So he was looking for more intimate experiences? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And you we re saying -- 

 

A: So we separated, but we di
dn™t fight. And when he -- he 
came to tell me he is in a 
transpor t, this is in ™44, when they all were 
leaving in the third tran
sport, and will I would 
accompany him to the Schleusse, and I said, ﬁY
es, I™ll go with you.ﬂ And his last word -- 
words were, wait for me .  But we were not 
going together, what do I™m waiting for?  His 
mother stayed, his father went
, too. And we were very good fr
iends, she came  to visit us 
in Israel, hi s mother. 
 

Q: So he -- 

 

A: He was an oldest chil
d, he was a terrible -- 
 

Q: Loss. 

 
A: -- terrible loss to her. She 
stayed in Terezín, we were ther
e, because she worked in the 
mi ca, and those people were also safe because 
that was war effort. So she stayed till the 
end, too, like I did. 
 
Q: Now, when you talk about yourself, with resp
ect to sexual intimacy, 
did you notice that -- 
 

A: We knew what™s going 
on, but I just wasn™t -- 
 

Q: You weren™t ready. 

 

A: I wasn™t ready, not in camp, and not 
under those conditions. That™s not for me. 
 

Q: But you -- but you noticed that
 this was happening around you? 
 

A: Oh yeah, we knew that, that there were pl
enty of girls who we re
 willing, go ahead. I had 
better ideas about my life. 
 

Q: Was this surprising to 
you, shocking to you, or no? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
90 
 
 
A: No. I just wa sn™t ready in the [indeciphera
ble]. I wasn™t ready b
ecause I don™t think my 
parents would approve. My parents were all 
to me , and I wanted to live the way my  
parents wanted me to be. I -- my mother 
was very modern and everything. We never 
talked about sex or anything like that, but I 
thought she wouldn™t appr
ove, so -- not just 
casual, I couldn™t. 
 
Q: Right. Do you think people were being casual? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Theywere? 

 

A: Yes. Even some  of my friends. 

 

Q: And they -- 

 

A: And they knew it. 

 

Q: And when you say casual, you mean 
they weren™t in love with some body?  

 

A: They were neve -- not in love some body, 
it was just the present that counted, and 
some body e - else can come  a fterwards, and I 
wasn™t that type, 
I couldn™t do that. 
 

Q: Did you understand it? 

 

A: I knew that I couldn™t do it. 
 
Q: No, no, no, I -- no, no, I™m not talking about 
understanding yourself
. I understand that 
you understood yourself. Did you understand o-other -- the wome n and [indecipherable] 
 

A: I did not judge them, no,
 I did not judge them.  
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: That™s their way of life. My
 best friend was that way. She told me  about it, she told me 
I™m stupid. 
 

Q: And why did she think you were stupid?  Because she thought you should do this? 

 

A: Because I didn™t take advantage of the -- 

 

Q: Of the -- 

 

A: -- free -- of being free, not even having parent
s. She had her mother there, and I -- I just -- 
I don™t know. I -- I wasn™t ma ture enough. I think I was too yo-young, even though in age 

I was older. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
91 
 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: By this time  I am 20 - 21. And so today 21, that™s -- 

 

Q: Old. 

 

A: -- old. I mean, you know, I just wasn™t ma ture 
for that. I did not think that -- I -- I wanted 
relationship, but some thing that I can
 value, and that wasn™t there.  
 

Q: Right. No, I™m not suggesting that you should 
have been different. It™s a very -- it™s -- I -- 
I would imagine in some  situations of -- of 
that level of depravation, with the possibility 
that you™ll die, that one mi ght say, this is so
me thing that I™ll do. And I suspect that that 
mi ght be what motivated -- 
 

A: That wa -- was for them, and not for me . 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Edgar says I was stupid. He says I was stupid 
till I got ma rried. He had always said I was 
stupid as a young kid. I don™t know, you know, I re
spected my  parents very much, and all 
my life, I just wanted to be the person they wanted me  to be. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: The -- it was very important to me , I don™t know. 
 
Q: No, I understand. 

 

A: But I think -- I always said to Edgar, it 
would be different -- because I had my s -- my 
fights with my parents, I wanted things that
 they said no. My father wouldn™t let me  go 
on trips when he thought it™s too dangerous, be
cause he was overprotective, and I was -- 
tell you I told him you are worse than Hitle
r, Hitler said eight, and you say 7:30, you 
know, but he had to be 7:30. So we f -- I had fi
ghts with my parents,
 I wasn™t the -- just 
the cream of a relationshi p. But they died so
 tragically. I couldn™t do anything for them, 
to help them. If they lived certain age and died
 of illness, and I could take care of them, I 

don™t think it would be so painful, and I don™
t think that you would have such a impact, 
their teac hing, on me  like this, what  happened. 
Because I believed strongly that they will 
come back. For me it was a shock. For whatev
er , my parents will come back, my father 
knows what to do. He will help Mother, and he
 will -- he always -- he survived World 
War I, he will survive this war. So I was -- I 
believed my father be powerful, and -- which 
he wasn™t. You know?  So the -- for me , 
the hardest time s we re after ™45. 
 

Q: We have to change the tape. 

 

End of Tape #7

Tape #8 
 
Q: When your parents and brother were de
ported, and you couldn™t go, you must have felt 
really awful. 
 

A: We all did. We were in the barracks from
 which they were deported, we were 29 girls 
with our backpacks that we packed, thinking 
-- what some times the Germans did, if they 
room in the -- in the wagons, or if not 
enough people they thought were deported, they 
would collect anybody they saw on -- in the c
ourtyard, and sh -- we thought ma ybe that 
way we get with. So we stayed until the train left. 
 

Q: Hoping to get on? 

 

A: Hoping to. And we were huddled there all ni
ght, because we couldn™t go back in, back 
home . We  were 29, and we were 
all crying because th
e parents just left. And that was it, 
we were devastated, but I did what my parent
s said, I have to go back to work, and I had 
to survive.  
 

Q: So you end up with -- 

 

A: But the three days were diffi cult, I was c
onstantly thinking that 
three days we ne -- I 
don™t know how we knew that it takes three da
ys. Some body must have 
told us it takes 
about three days to get to Au
schwitz -- to Birkenau. We  didn™
t think it™s the same  thing. 
 

Q: Youdidn™t? 

 
A: They were talking about Birkenau. But we 
didn™t know it™s next to Auschwitz, we didn™t 
know where it is. We  thought it™s 
another camp l i ke Terezín.  
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: That we knew some how. 

 

Q: You knew the name , but you had no idea -- 

 

A: We didn™t know -- no idea. 

 

Q: -- of the con -- no idea what it
 was, and that the conditions -- 
 

A: But they said three days it takes to get ther e. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: So when the three days were over, I sa
id, ﬁOh God, they™re out of the wagons.ﬂ My 
mother had some  food, and some  dr ink in 
the wagon for the trip. Whether she ate it, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479

whether she didn™t, I have no idea. And my 
father, too. And I was relieved after there 
days, because I thought they were now start ma ybe working, and ma ybe they had to -- 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- establish themselves, and what I didn™t know 
that that™s -- when th
ey arrived, that™s the 
end. Ah, not my father, my mother. 
 

Q: Right. So from Nove mb er unt
il the Russians come in May -- 
 

A: Russians came  May eighth.  

 

Q: Eighth of 1945. 

 

A: But some how we knew some thing is happening 
because in April -- first of all, people 
weren™t coming back to Terezín in the awful 
state they were in. And there was lot of 
work to do, we still had to have the vegeta
bl e growing, we still ha d to have -- feed the 
people. There were not enough people to do things, because we  were so decima ted, just 

the few of us. And the Red Cross, Czech Red Cross came over -- 
 

Q: There™s another Red Cross visit, right? 

 

A: No, the Czechs came over -- 

 

Q: Czechs. 

 
A: -- around the fourth of May. Th
ey -- I think fourth of May they moved s o me  people from 
the small fortress into the hospitals in -- in Te
rezín. And in April, the Swedish re -- Red 
Cross, the -- came with I think four buses,
 I don™t know how ma ny. And they picked up 
all the Danes -- there were the Danish peopl
e. And the Danes were very good if -- they 
took all their girlfriends with them, even 
though they were not Danish. And some ti me s 
they were not girlfriends, they just took some body with them to get them out. The SS 
didn™t say anything. The Swedes were st
anding now and giving out cigarettes and 
chocolate, and the SS wanted to stop him,
 and he  said -- they just showed him 
[indecipherable] the SS ma n decide. So we knew some thing has happened, the SS 

wouldn™t interfere. There was nobody who would in
terfere if you wanted to get in, or the 
SS didn™t say anything if you wanted to ge
t on the bus. Depended 
whether the Swedes 
will take you. So some  people got to Sweden that way, like a fr en -- 
 

Q: Did you -- did you -- 

 

A: I didn™t want to leave, no way. 

 

Q: Cause you™re waiting, you think your parent s are comi ng back. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
94 
 
 
A: My parents and my brother will come, and th
at™s wa -- we -- I didn™t know where to go in 
Prague. Wh ere do we meet in big Prague?  Th
ey know I am here, they will come  here. 
That™s what we had, you come  back to Terezín, 
I™ll wait for you. So I didn™t want to leave 
any more, no way.  
 
Q: So who is doing the kitchens, 
I mean, there -- s -- you -- you -- 
 

A: Women, all women -- 

 

Q: Wome n. Everyth -- 

 

A: -- and there were no -- very few men, there were some -- 

 

Q: -- men. I see. 

 

A: -- there were some . Ther e were some  in the agriculture too, but very few. And when the 
Russians came from that time, it was the worst 
thing, because first of all they quarantined 
us right away, you couldn™t
 move freely any more. 
 

Q: Within the ghetto you couldn™t move freely -- 

 

A: No, within the ghetto, you could -- 

 

Q: Oh, you could, you -- 

 

A: -- but you couldn™t go out. We  could, we were
 agriculture, again. I could go in and out, 
and I did. My sister-in-law, as soon as she 
heard that my brother -- someone -- I don™t 
know how the news traveled. My sister-in-law 
found out that my brother is on the way to 

Prague, so I knew my brother survived, he™s
 going to Prague. So she said, ﬁI leave 
everything here. Wa tch over our things, weneed everything. I™m going to Prague.ﬂ She 

left. My friend left too, for Prague. And then
 she said, ﬁI got an apartment back, if you 
want to come, come .ﬂ So I decided with 
another fr iend, we will go, I want to see my 

brother. Meanwhile, the people from the last 
transport came, who said that my mother 
didn™t survive, that she did ma
ke the right side. I didn™t be
lieve them. In my mi nd I knew 
it™s true, but in my heart, no. My mot her is so
me where in a hospital, she -- sh -- I™m sure 
sh -- she said she™ll survive, she™ll keep he
r word. And -- but I decided I want to see my 
brother. I didn™t know anything about my fath
er. But le -- meanwhile, my brother spoke 
with Erna Haarth, and knew about my father
, and he told me . And was devastating for 
me , but you know, I was still hoping ma ybe it™s 
not true, ma ybe some body else died, and 
not him, ma ybe. He™s so sick, ma ybe heforgot his name , ma ybe -- you know, I -- 
 

Q: Well,sure. 

 

A: -- I wanted the impossible to come  true. So
 we met with my brother, I saw my brother 
and that was nice, and then I went back. B
ecause he said, ﬁGo back, and you have to 
come  only when you can take all your luggage
, we need everything. 
I have nothing what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
95 
 
 
I have only.ﬂ And he left few things when he
 went to Auschwitz, and I have few things 
from my father and mother, so I watched ove
r it, and on the first of
 June, they announced 
that the fi rst transpor t going to Prague, so
 I imme diately put myself on the list, pack 
everything, took all the luggage I 
could in the train, and I went
 for Prague -- first of -- 
Prague, first of June, and I went -- I knew wh
ere my sister-in-law, my brother are. Her 
father came back, so he got his own apartmen
t back, so that™s where we me t. And sh -- 
and I brought the things, she didn™
t let them come  up, I had to 
leave it all in 
the courtyard, 
and they sprayed it till that 
we don™t bring the bedbugs. Ba 
-- back to the bedbugs. We 
thought that Theresienstadt 
is moving, and that™s -- 
 
Q: Everywhere. 

 

A: -- from the bag -- bedbugs, millions of them. So -- so that™s how I came home , with the 
first empty -- and I found out from t he poems, a nd from some writing of his mother, she 

wrote a little diar
y what happened -- 
 

Q: Edgar™s -- Edgar™s mother. 

 

A: Edgar™s mother. It™s hard to read because sh
e wrote in pencil. And she writes that first of 
June they came by train to Prague, so they were on the same  train I was, but I didn™t 

know them, so I wouldn™t know who they were. 
 

Q: Yes, right. Now, if I can interrupt your st
ory for a mo ment, is there a story about bedbugs 
-- 
 

A: Yeah, there is a stor y that -- yeah -- 
 
Q: -- and a candle that I™m supposed to ask you about. 

 

A: But from him, not from me. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: As you know, we lived on the bunkbeds -- 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- with Eva, and right at the window, the f
ourth window from the co
rner wa s our window. 
And downstairs the me n were working on the 
railroad day and night. Now we had with 

Eva, a arrangement that if one is being b
itten, she wakes the othe
r up, then both of us 
look for them. Now we didn™t have
 what to do with them, so we
 put water in that dish we 
were fus -- getting our food in, put water in 
it, and we were throwing them in to drown 

them. But we had to do it always together, a
nd we had to find them. So we had a candle. 
And in summer it was hot, we slept naked. So
 we would light the candle and look for it, 
and Edgar said they had a good show downsta
irs, the boys did, who were working. We 
didn™t care. We couldn™t sleep, 
we had to catch the bedbugs. So
 that™s the story he likes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
96 
 
 
 
Q: I see. The candle had nothing to do with
 the bedbugs, but ju
st had to see -- 
 

A: No, we had to see where --  

 

Q: -- see them -- right. 

 

A: -- where to catch them. How do you see them in the dark? 

 

Q: Right. So many people saw you. 

 

A: And you couldn™t -- not too ma ny. You coul
dn™t put on the big li
ght, because you would 
wake everybody. So we would put on the candle and look for the bedbugs. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So we can sleep. 

 

Q: It™s fortunate you didn™
t start a fire, I guess. 
 

A: We didn™t think of that. 

 

Q: So you come back to Prague. How long 
does it take you before you believe that your 
parents are not comi ng back? 
 

A: I don™t know because I -- I wanted to belie
ve for a long time, maybe s-six months. We 
had to dict -- we had -- we wanted to get some
thing back from my parents, so we went to 
the insurance company because th
ey had life insurance. We  went to the firm whether my 
father wouldn -- get something from like pe
nsion or some thing that he paid, but of 
course, we were over 21, so there wa s nothi
ng we  could get. And the -- the insurance 
company wanted death certificate. We  coul
dn™t explain to them we don™t have death 
certificates, they died in a camp. So we had 
to go to the court and declare them deceased, 
and that took six months. And then we got
 o-officially death 
certificate. And I don™t 
know whether that made me believe. I don™t thin
k I wanted ever to believe that they are 
dead. And then we went to the insurance 
company, and then they told us, well the 
Germans took their life insuranc
es and everything. It™s in
 Germany. So we wrote to 
Germany ne c -- to the company, and they said 
give us proof. They wouldn™t give us the 
proof, and they didn™t believe us, so that wa
s lost. I don™t know when I stopped believing, 
when I knew they are gone. I didn™t want to 
believe it. I knew that. I -- I saw -- I don™t 

know whether I even could have taken the 
suffering I saw in the other people and the 
state they were in, imagining that my  father 
would look like that. So I didn™t wish that on 

them either. I just want ed them to be a
live, and the way they were before. So -- 
 

Q: You wanted to move from one period of time, ba ck to the other.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
97 
 
 
A: Back to whatever, but nothing I ve -- I 
-- they wouldn™t give me our apartment back 
because my brother lived with his wi fe ther
e, and I was a only person, the apartment was 
so -- too big, so I didn™t get an apartment, 
I had no right for an apartment as a single 
person, so I had to find a room some where,
 and I had to find a job. And I didn™t know 
anything. And luckily a friend of mi ne send me  
to the trade unions that they are looking 
for some body. I don™t know why they took me , because I was supposed to work as a 

secret ary and I never -- I -- meaning -- I say I 
never saw, I saw a typewriter, but I never 
worked on a typewriter. But they took me  and gave me  chance to learn. And I was lucky 

to have a job, and when I had a job, I rent
ed a room, and that™s how I started, with 
nothing. But I still, you know, in back of my
 mi nd, some mi r acle will happen, but -- 
 

Q: [inaudible] 

 

A: -- in my -- in my head I knew it is impossi
ble. I went every day to the -- there was a 
offi ce of political pr isoners, which we  were considered by that  time, political prisoners, 

and they published every day a new list w
hom they found in some  hospitals, or in 

Germany, survivors. And I would go there ever
y day to look for the name s, whether my 
parent™s name s appear there. I was searchi
ng. I went to Red Cross, whether they have 
some  people that, you know, we think ma ybe
 they just lost the me mory and don™t 

reme mber where they are from, or who they
 are, whether that 
exists, you know?  There 
were some  people in shw -- Sweden, I wanted
 to know whether they are -- whether the 
Red Cross there knows about them. But there 
was no -- no wa y that there -- could survive 
in a -- when people were witnesses that -- not 
the -- exactly to it, but witnesses to what 
happened, and they knew. 
 

Q: Was your brother like you, 
or did he believe them?  
 

A: No. 

 

Q: He -- he believed they we re -- 

 

A: He -- he knew, but he had his wife, and 
my si -- nephew was born September ™46, he -- 
he went back to school. That™s why he told
 me , ﬁI can™t help you, I am student, I don™t 
have money.ﬂ He lived with his father-in-la
w and his wife and -- and the son. And he had 
a new life, I didn™t. Not -- no -- very fe -- 
all my fr iends that we  were the groups, few 
girls came, no boys. None of my -- 
 

Q: So Honza is --  

 

A: -- the friends I knew -- no. 

 

Q: Honza didn™t come  back? 

 

A: No, no, none of them. 

 

Q: None of the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
98 
 
 
 
A: None of my brother™s frie
nds, none of my friends, none of
 the boys I knew survived. Of 
one friend, one brother, who lives in Aust
ralia, who was like four years younger. His 
brother was ou -- my brother™s friend. So we
 were in a group. But from the groups we 

were bef -- before the -- before Terezín, none 
of my ma le friends, if you put it that way, 
that were in a group, not all th
e boyfriend, came back. Only the ones i -- Eva is -- few of 
the girls, and the rest were the girls we 
lived through the whole -- 
until the end, because 
they were in agriculture. 
 

Q: So you™re 22 or 23, in -- 

 

A: In ™45, I was 22. 

 

Q: -- 19 [indecipherable] 22. ™46 you™re 23. And 
you not only don™t have your parents, your 
whole world has collap -- essentially has collapsed. 
 

A: Yes. Yeah, and don™t forget, I -- my aunt, 
whom I loved very dear
ly is gone. My uncle, 
my three cousins. My mother had an extens
ive family with whom we wer e  very, very 
close. One of her cousins which -- whom I knew very well, survived in Bratislava, and 

two of them -- so I was in t
ouch with them. And her sons, I 
wa s very close, which are like 
second cousins already. One survived in England.
 In ™47 I went to visit him, we are still 
in touch. That was the whole family that surv
ived, but the family that was living in --  
near Votice where we went visit -- when we
 went visiting my grandma, my mother™s 

cousin would call all the cousins and her aunt, 
and we would have big dinner, and th -- it 
was like a huge fa mily, even though they were
 mother™s cousins, they were not -- you 

know, ki -- my close family, but we were very 
close, and I loved them like an -- all were 
gone. Everybody there was gone from her fa mil
y. Her brother, the brother™s family, the 
three children and his wi
fe. The -- everybody was gone. 
 
Q: How difficult was it for you with your -- with
 your brother, with 
whom you were close in 
a certain way, but now he™s moving in anot
her direction, and you don™t know where to 

move?  You -- your -- i-is that difficult? 
 

A: I think I suffered, but I knew that I have to
 do what he says. I can™t hang on him. I knew I 
would be dead weight if -- in that case, 
and that I have -- I have to do some thing.  
 

Q: So does in some  way your having been in Te
rezín -- I -- I hate to put it like this, but in 
some  way a help to you because it wa s the fi
rst time in your life you were alone, before 

anything bad happens. So you 
learn that you can cope. 
 

A: Yes, yes, it helped me, it made me different. 
It ma de me  aware of different life than just 
protected by my parents, and 
I think it helped me  to f -- put my feet down on the ground 
in ™45, because that was very difficult. I 
-- today I think it was difficult too, because I 
have nobody to talk to. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
99 
 
 
 
A: Nobody wa nted to listen to us. With my friends
 I could, and we were all in the same  boat. 
But nobody want -- I couldn™t went -- I couldn™t 
talk to my brother, he wouldn™t listen. 
 

Q: Hewouldn™t? 

 

A: No. He looked only forward, my brother. He
 wouldn™t listen what 
-- just forget what 
happened. You -- you have to look forward. So
 you know today we know that some time s 

people need to talk. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: I didn™t know it that  time, either. 

 

Q: Well, you knew in some  way, because you wanted it. 

 

A: I think so, but I didn™t know -- have 
a person that I would want to talk to. 
 

Q: You didn™t find some one? 

 

A: No. Eva was in the sa -- you know, my friends
 went through the same with me , but most 
of my friends had fa mily. Had mothers. Ev
a had her mother, my other friend had her 
mother. Most of them. One had mother and father.  
 

Q: And Ma ma  Dittel never 
said do you want to -- 
 
A: No, no. They wanted to forget, too. 
 

Q: Everybody wanted to forget.  

 

A: Mama  Dittel went through Auschwitz, she didn™
t want to talk about it. We  were visiting, 
we were very close, I was very close with them.  
 

Q: So w -- you -- 

 

A: But not close enough to have a shelter there. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: I had no shelter, you know? 

 

Q: You had no shelter. 

 

A: Until 1948. I was moving from room to room because somebody got married, because a 
friend took me in and the brother ma rried, they
 needed the space. I pi ck up my trunk and 
I move. In 1948 my friend brother had a little
 studio apartment. You had to have a permit 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
100 
 
 
from the town, you had to get -- it™s -- it was 
very complicated to get an apartment. But 
he we -- he was running in front of -- away 
from the Communists, and she said move int -
- into his apartment and then you will have it. 
So I did, and that™s the 
fir -- and from work 
they helped me  to get the apartment, and I 
had roof over my head 
permanent, that nobody 
can tell me I™m getting married, you have to 
mo ve out, or you know, things like that. I 
moved from place to place 
during the three years. 
 

Q: So for those -- those years, ‚45 to ‚48,
 you don™t have a permanent place at all. You 
always were thinking -- 
 

A: Any time I cou -- can be asked to move out. 

 

Q: And all that  time you™re 
working as a secretary? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: So you learned how -- 

 

A: From -- from auba -- August ™45. I had to, 
I had no money. I had to take the job as soon 
as it appeared. 
 

Q: And you learned how to type, I gather. 

 

A: I learned how to type, yeah. 

 

Q: Were you good? 
 
A: I don™t know, they kept me . 

 

Q: They kept you, I guess you were good. 

 

A: I worked here 25 years. 

 

Q: Yes? 

 

A: Yes. In one job as Admi nistrati
ve Secretary, so I think I did okay. 
 

Q: Obviously, very good. And you ma rried
 -- you me t Edgar in ™46, and -- 
 

A: Well, we me t and separated, and he went 
to -- to Switzerland and I went to England 
because I wanted that -- I wanted to learn 
better English, and I spen
t about six weeks, ™47, 
in England, and I wanted to stay in Engl
and. And they offered me  you could stay as 
domestic. Well, when I wrote that  to my 
brother he exploded. ﬁYou didn™t survive the 
war to be a ma id. You have a job here. We
 are the only fami ly and you are tearing it 

apart.ﬂ So I returned. You can go any time you 
want to England. And I returned because -

- and then the Communis t s came and I couldn™t go -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
101 
 
 
 
Q: And you couldn™t go. And then you re-met Edgar. 

 

A: Edgar, in ™48, when he came back fr om 
[indecipherable] and suddenly appeared in my 
office. Had no idea why we didn™t hear for ye
ar -- for the two years he wa s away we 
didn™t hear fr om hi m cha  -- 
 

Q: For two years you were separated, that™s -- 

 

A: A year and some thing, I don™t know exactly. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. And he found you, cause he knew where you were. 

 

A: I was still working, he knew where I was working -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh,yes. 

 

A: -- so he went to look up for me . 

 

Q: Yes. And you took up again. 

 

A: We started to go out again, and by thistime he™s a -- he was sophisticated, he was 
traveled in the world, and he wa
s good looking, and I got interested.  
 

Q: Right. More than you were before. 

 
A: I wasn™t interested be fore because first of
 all my friend was interest ed in hi m, and she 
invited him, and I didn™t want to take hi
m away from her. I didn™t know what the 
arrangement is, I didn™t know he was not inte
rested, or interested
 in me  more, I don™t 
know. I just didn™t feel it™s right. She introduced us, but she to
ld me  she is interested in 
him. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: But she -- she has a f -- she ma rried, but she --
 we planned together to run away with my 
friend, the one that lives in New Jersey. By th
at time  she got back the business -- she and 
her sister survived, so sh -- they got the -- 
back the business of her father. And she had 
some money, and to get ille
gally across the border that time, what she found was like 
10,000 dol -- crowns, not dollar. And she did it
, and I was visiting my brother at that 
time, but even if I were in Prague I c
ouldn™t go, I didn™t have 
the 10,000. So she left 
illegally in ™48, in May. And 
so after she left, and Edgar came back, I had no problem. 
 

Q: Right. You could see him. 

 

A: She was gone -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
102 
 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: -- she was here in United States alre
ady. And she had a boyfriend, and ma rried an 
American soldier that was in -- in Ge
rmany. So we are very close, both. 
 

Q: And how soon after you -- you 
start seeing ed -- and it™s Ed
gar Krasa, in case anybody 
doesn™t real ize -- 
 

A: Pretty soon I got interested. 

 

Q: Interested-- 

 

A: Very pretty soon, he didn™t know 
it that I ma de up my mi nd. That™s it -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- that ™s the right pe
rson. The first time, no. 
 

Q: And how soon after you decided were you will
ing to meet his parents?  Or did you me et 
him s -- 
 

A: He asked very fast about that, that wa s one
 thing that I didn™t wa
nt, I thought it™s too 
serious the fi rst time when he star ted ri
ght away we go to visit my parents.  
 

Q: Isee. 

 
A: But Edgar took it as a visit. I came there w
ith him, I agreed to it because I was already 
interested in him. A
nd the mother™s -- he said, ﬁI wa
nt you to meet my girlfriend,ﬂ new 
girlfriend, whatever he said. 
And her mother -- my mother-in-law said, ﬁAnother one?ﬂ 
Like what -- she shouldn™t think she™s the onl
y one. And his father looks me  over, I was 
very skinny that time, and says, ﬁWhat do you 
see in her? Nothing front, nothing back.ﬂ 
So that was their greeting. 
 

Q: This is the introduction. 

 

A: But they were, you know, I have not seen a 
family together that 
all -- everybody, like two 
parents and the son. I -- I thought it was so
me thing ma rvelous to 
be invited to dinner 
there, and -- and share.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And Edgar was a great son, he did not -- he
 would -- Mother would go with us to every 
concert, which I some times didn™t like, he doesn™t even know it. Cause I wanted to be all 

alone with him, too. 
 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
103 
 
 
 
A: And we had to go every Sunday to visit hi
s parents and play cards with them, you know, 
he was that kind of a son. He wouldn™t leav
e them even -- he would bring the company 
there. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And I liked it because  it was fa
mily. There was so me thing tangible. 
 

Q: And it was a kind of devotion you understood -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: -- because you -- you had that. 

 

A: I think I respected it. I respected it becau
se I saw it at home, too. My father and my 
mother were really dedicated to his parents. 
My mother didn™t have
 her parents any more. 
My mother was great with her mother-in- law and father-in-law, and -- and there was 

great respect, and we had to re
spect the grandparents very much. 
 

Q: You described yourselfas feeling very guilty. 

 

A: Yeah,always. 

 

Q: And you still feel guilty? 

 
A: Ofcourse. 
 

Q: Do you really blame yourself? 

 

A: No, but all the girls that 
went, like Eva with her mother, 
and the other Eva that I knew, 
saved their mothers because their mothers had a 
reason to try to be together, would try to 
get to the other side. That happened. 
 

Q: But it didn™t always happen. 

 

A: Probably not. I only look
ed at when it happened. 
 

Q: When it happened, and blamed your
self for not being able to do it. 
 

A: Yes. I couldn™t do anything for my fa ther. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
104 
 
 
A: That was hopeless. And wouldn™t be even
 near him, because me n were immediately 
separated, which we didn™t know. But after 
knowing everything in 
™45, I felt if I was 
there, ma ybe I could have sav -- 
everybody said it™s ridiculous, I know. 
 
Q: You know it intellectually. 

 

A: Probably. 

 

Q: But not -- not in your heart. 

 

A: No. Cause I really tried hard, and it di
dn™t happen, so ma ybe I didn™t try hard enough.  
 

Q: Is this your punishme nt? 

 

A: I don™t know. I don™t know, but I was tied to
 my -- you know, there are -- my brother was 
more independent than I was. Since he wa
s a boy, he was mor e  inden -- independent. 
And my kids, thanks to Edgar were i
ndependent. I wouldn™t have let them be 
independent. So ma ybe that™s -- I wasn™t -- 
I -- I tell you, I wasn™t mature for being alone 
in the world and do for myself. Some -- Edga
r was. He was the one who fed his parents 
since he was 14. Sup -- Supported this parents.  And he was very easy to start anywhere 

else life. For me  there -- every time  it wa
s difficult. Whether it was Israel, or it was 

United States. And so I am not so courageous
 like he is. I needed some where to come  
back to.

Tape #9 
 
Q: I know there™s a -- a lot more to your story 
after the war, it™s very complicated, but I -- 
we™ll have to do a lot of that at another time , 
but a lot of people think that when the word 
liberation is used, like [indecipherable] right
, that everything is 
fine. And it™s not. 
 

A: We thought so too. 

 

Q: You thought it was -- 

 

A: We thought so too. But our liberation was,
 you go back home, I go back to school and 
everythi ng will be normal. And of course it 
wasn™t, it cannot be norma l. And my sister-

in-law who got the apartment back wasn™t normal. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: She got interrupted her schooling even earlier than I did. They did offer you -- they give 
you a paper that you finished school, but what
™s the use, that education was mi ssing 
anyhow. So you thought liberation means back 
to where you were before the war. And 
like when you saw, if you go back to
 your home t own, it™s not the same .  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: We didn™t -- we didn™t know 
that, or we didn™t wa nt to know
 it, and didn™t think about it. 
 

Q: Right. That was -- that
 was the fa ntasy while 
you were in Terezín. 
 

A: Yeah, yes.  

 

Q: But it™s a very diffi cult adjustme
nt, if one ever fully adjusts. 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Do you think you adjusted? 

 

A: I think once I me t Edgar, and we started new 
life, and then really, I think that was for me  
good life. That was what -- 
 

Q: Yes,yeah. 

 

A: -- I wanted from the beginning. I didn™t want a career, I wanted a family. So I worked 
because I have to support myself. I didn™t thi
nk of working my self up or some thing, that 
wasn™t important. Important was to have family. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
106 
 
 
A: So my brother said -- I said, if I don™t ha
ve a kid by -- or some thing by 25, I™m going to 
do it without the husband. My mother, you know? 
 
Q: Yes. 

 

A: Ahead of the time. So my brother joked th
at, ﬁI think some body will sacrifice hi mself, I 
put an ad in the newspaper.ﬂ I was determin
ed to have it one way or the other. I was 
determined. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: I wanted a fa mily, but if I can™t 
have it, I™ll ma ke  my own family.  
 

Q: And what was it -- what was it about havi
ng a family. Wa s it rec
onstituting what you had 
before and recreating it -- 
 

A: Yeah,yeah 

 

Q: Is that what it was? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: So that you could ma ke it. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 
Q: Mm-h m.  
 

A: Ineededit. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: You know, s o me  people are [i
ndecipherable] they don™t even 
want a partner or anything, 
because it -- it™s -- you ha ve to adjust to a part
ner, too, and all that, so they don™t want to 
do it. But for me that was important. 
 

Q: You said you ma inly had bad dream
s or nightmares after the war.  
 

A: After -- after the war. 

 

Q: Did that continue for ma ny years?  Does it -- 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: -- even now? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
107 
 
 
A: No, I don™t think so any more, no. 
 

Q: And the bad dreams are -- 

 

A: Even in Israel -- in Israel  I was dreaming we
 are in Prague, want to
 get out, and can™t, and 
Edgar is in Israel, how will we get together. Things being separated, so I had dreams 

about that. But I think 
that stopped already. 
 

Q: And did you ever have nightma res about Te
rezín, that you we re back in Terezín? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Youdid? 

 

A: Yes. And can™t get out. 

 

Q: And you can™t get out. 

 

A: Always this can™t get out. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Or after we ran away, that I am b
ack in Czechoslovakia and can™t get out. 
 

Q: Right. 

 
A: That -- that did happen, yes. 
 

Q: And I™m certain you™ve dreamt about your pa
rents. Or I shouldn™t be so certain -- 
 

A: I dreamt of a -- 

 

Q: Iguess. 

 

A: -- yes, I dreamt  that I found them in a hosp
ital in Poland. I -- I dreamt that they came su-
suddenly back. I wouldn™t even know how they would find me , because we didn™t ha ve a 

common address -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- or anything where to find me , 
but you don™t think about these things. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And till today when I think about my  parents, 
I see them the way they were in their 50™s. 
I have no idea how they would age. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
108 
 
 
 
Q: Of course, of course. When did you st
art talk -- who did you find, when you found 
some one to talk about what you had gone through? 
 

A: Nobody until Edgar. 

 

Q: Nobody until Edgar. 

 

A: Until he wanted to know what I did, or some thing, no. And until the 90™s, nobody wanted 
to hear. People I worked with fo
r 25, didn™t even know I was in a camp. 
 

Q: Did they know you had come  from Israel, from th -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And from Europe? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: But they never said, what happened? 

 

A: They were young people that were 
born here and they didn™t know it. 
 

Q: But you were in United States when the 
film, ﬁThe Holocaustﬂ was on television. 
 

A: Well then that -- 
 
Q: 1978. 

 

A: That was in ™78? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: I think that™s when people st
arted to get so in -- I thought 
it was in 80 - some thing, so I 
thought that™s when people star
t to be interested. And that™s
 when they started to ask 
questions, yes, after that movie. 
That was a serial, and that -- 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- that -- that was 
anyhow fiction, that™s -- 
 

Q: Yes, it was fiction. 

 

A: -- not a true story. 

 

Q: That™sright. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
109 
 
 
 
A: I saw it, and I thought, that isn™t true. 

 

Q: Terribl e. 

 

A: Terribl e. 

 

Q: But it worked, because a lo
t of people started talking. 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Yeah. And was it helpful then, or  was it too late? 

 

A: I don™t know, but I think what happened to us
 is that we found out 
that being quiet is 
harmful, people should know that as we ar
e dying out, there are comi ng more and more 
people that will say it never happened.  
 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: It™s fiction, it™s imagination. And in me mory
 of a ll those that di
ed, that it should be 
known and so I can talk.  
 

Q: But you don™t talk in school
s, am I correct?  Is it -- 
 

A: No, because I am not a public speaker. 

 
Q: Oh. 
 

A: I am very conscious of my accent.  

 

Q: It™s a beautiful accent. 

 

A: It™sterrible. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: When I heard myself on the tape the fi
rst time , I said, I sound like [indecipherable] 

 

Q: No you don™t. 

 

A: On the tape I do. 

 

Q: Absolutelynot.[indecipherable] 

 

A: And I get embarrassed in front of all people.
 I -- you know, this is fi
ne, I can do this any 
time. And besides, I already 
feel I know you, since yesterda
y and feel very comfortable 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
110 
 
 
with all of you here. But total 
strangers, I -- I have difficu
lty, and Edgar can do it with a 
thousand people, he doesn™t mi nd, and he will jo
ke, and he™s witty, I am not. I can™t joke 
about it. Wh en he gets embarrasse
d he jokes more. [indecipherable] 
 
Q: And you don™t. 

 

A: Idon™t. 

 

Q: You -- you get very shy. 

 

A: Yeah. I don™t -- besi -- and again, I don™t have
 what to tell in the 
schools, it™s not such a 
interesting story like his. Come s back to that. 
 

Q: Well, I guess that™s in the eye of th
e beholder, what™s in
teresting or not. 
 

A: I know, but you know, especially the way Terezí
n is pictured now as a paradise for the 
Jews. So -- what should I tell them?  
 

Q: It wasn™t a paradise for you. 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Or for anyone else there. 

 

A: For anyone. And that™s where I have  the diffi
culty, take pe ople back there, because the 
psychological, the fright when it came  tran
sport is going, new transport is collecting. 
Who is going to go, which friend is going to be 
in it?  Will I be in it? Where is it going?  
That -- that psychological -- th
at cloud was over you all the tim
e. All those years, up to 
the end we di dn™t know when a transport is 
going, until the Re d Cross came . Because one 
thing we were afraid of all that, what  will th
e end be like?  Will they shoot us all? Now we 
are such a small group here, they have it much 
easier. Will they let us survive?  And when 
we heard the stories that they did not let 
the people survive, the last day they were 
shooting them, I don™t think they 
would -- if they have time w
ould have not be willing to 
do it to Terezín, too. So that was -- we  were
 always afraid of the end, even though we 
were in Terezín, the end was for us a myster
y. And we thought in ma sses is strength, that 
they can™t kill 50,000 people, but we 
learned that they could, so -- 
 

Q: Let me  just ask you one -- I™ll ask you two 
more questions. One has to do with the -- the 
world in which you live now, that -- that is
n™t the Holocaust. When you hear the news 
about genocides in various countries, in Rw
anda in ™94, in Bosnia, in Cambodia -- 
 

A: You are saying it™s going on again -- 

 

Q: Again. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
111 
 
 
A: -- and it™s everywhere, and s
till in the world. And I feel th
at huma ns do it to themselves. 
You know, I couldn™t believe in 
God afterwards, because my 
mother was such a angel, 
and my father helping everybody, how could they
 be killed? And the rabbi, I don™t even 
know his name , I don™t know where he came from, I met him some whe r e where I wa s. 
And I told hi m I don™t believe because He let my parents be killed, and who were so 

good. And he said to me , ﬁ What do you think God looks like? Do you think he™s there 

like a puppeteer, moving his finger and saying th
is one die, this one live?  God gave 
huma ns brain. Huma ns are doing this to human
s. He™s not guilty, he™s trying to ma ke you 
a better human. You believe in
 Him, you believe in good.ﬂ  
 

Q: Youbelievethat? 

 

A: I think humans that -- are doing it to themselves
. I don™t think that -- I th
ink it™s in -- it™s -
- they are animals. If a man can kill a lit
tle baby and go home  and hug his own baby, how 
can he do it? And that™s what the SS did. So 
they are not humans to me, they are just 
animals. And I can™t even treat animals badl
y, because they have f
eelings and pain; and 
they could, so they are worse than animals. 
 

Q: So has the world improved? 

 

A: No, they are still doing it. They 
are doing it st ill all over the world. 

 

Q: So this has to be a disappointme nt to you, you can™t -- 

 

A: It is, but I don™t know how to repair it, I™
m not that clever. Educa
tion, education, but what 
happened in Israel? The kids are educated to 
hate each other, the ki
ds are educated to 
fight, th -- th -- it™s -- they get hatred w
ith their mother™s milk. And it won™t be good until 
they change that. And I don™t think it will 
be for our generation to see. Maybe these 
terrible atrocities and terrible wars can ch
ange the generation of my grandchildren, that 
they get some sense, and say violence doe
sn™t pay, and shouldn™t be. Our generation 
wouldn™t do it. 
 

Q: Wehaven™tlearned. 

 

A: Hm?  

 

Q: Wehaven™tlearned. 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Is there anything you™d like to say that 
I haven™t asked you about, 
or you™d like to say 
anyway? 
 

A: No, I don™t think so, I don™t know. 

 

Q: Well, I want to thank you very much -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479  
112 
 
 
 
A: You™reverywelcome. 

 

Q: -- for your honesty and your being willing to ta
lk about what I know is really difficult for 
you. 
 

A: Sometimes. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: There are parts of -- even 
during the war when we were ha
ppy. I cherish, I think for life, 
all the friendships I ma de there, and we are st
ill writing, even if we 
can™t see each other, 
we are all over the world. This -- and I think 
those friendships, and those -- that closeness 
cannot be replaced, and cannot be achieved late
r. The circumstances were such that you 
became close, and that™s a great feeling to have such friends. 
 

Q: Right. We ll thank you again. 

 

A: You™rewelco me. 

 

Q: And who is this? 

 

A: This is my grandfather, Gustav Krasa, w
ho died some ti me  in 1923, so I have really never 
met hi m. That™s my mother™s father. She was a born Krasa. 
 

Q: And who is this? 
 
A: This is my grandmother, Johanna, born strass
a -- Krasa, who died 
much earlier, in 1913.  
 

Q: And who is this? 

 

A: This is my father Oskar Fuchs, and my mo
ther, ro -- Rosa Fuchs, and my brother, their 
firstborn, Yearje, which means Geor ge. 
 

Q: And this photo? 

 

A: This photo is again my brother, and 
me . A profe ssional pict
ure by a photographer. 
 

Q: About what year, do you know? 

 

A: I think I was about three here, ma ybe
 two and a half, some thing like that. 
 

Q: And this one? 

 

A: This one is again me  and my brother, I 
think about two years ol
der, ma ybe four I am 
here. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0479

A: This one is going to first grade. We  did not have kindergarten in our times like here. I 
was very proud to get the school bag,
 and I wanted a picture with it. 
 

Q: Doesn™t look like your brother was quite so happy. 

 

A: My brother was older, he wa

 third grade. 
 

Q: Andhere? 

 

A: That™s my brother in -- going to first gr

school bag, I wanted it too, when I went.  
 

Q: And this shot? 

 
A: This is me , but I™m not sure whether that

probably before going to 
gimnasium or something like that. 
 
Q: And this shot?   

 

A: This is around 1940, when we started to wear
 stars. Both my friend and me went to get 
pictures.  
 

Q: And who is this? 

 

A: This is my friend, Ollie Dupe, who pe
rished with the 5,000 Czech Jews on March 
seventh, 1944, in Auschwitz.  
 

Q: And this was the same  day that you took this 
picture that we just saw?  Right?  You went -
- the two of you went on the same  
day to get your photograph, right? 
 

A: No, this -- 

 

Q: Oh, this is different.

Q: This is Ollie? 

 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: And this is? 

 

A: Me. We  were pretty inseparable certain 
time s before I was transported away. Eva was 
already gone, so we were inseparable. 
 

Q: And this was when you were in the -- in the group? 

 

A: Yeah. This is during those groups. She was in the same  group as me . 

 

Q: And this shot? 

 

A: This is Ollie and her brother Gusta Dupe

Q: And you ma de the costumes?  

 

A: I had my -- there was a dress I had, and th
