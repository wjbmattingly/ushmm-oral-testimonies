Interview with Pal Rozsa 
June 18, 1992 
Rockville, Maryland 
 
A: My name  is Pal Rozsa.  First name , P-A-L; 
last name  R- O-Z-S-A.  
I was born in Budapest, 
Hungary in 1925, January 20. I always lived in B
udapest and there I fini
shed high school and 
later I went to university.  My father, Dezs
oh Rozsa; first name, D- E-Z-S-O-H (double-dot), 
was born in 1885, March 19.  He was a teacher in B
udapest for foreign languages, first of all 
English and French.  He gradua
ted in Budapest as well.  
 

Q: He taught at a high school?  

 

A: He taught in a high school, yes. A commer
cial high school; that means language was real 
important there.  
 

Q: Did he have a university degree? 

 

A: A university degree, yes.  He
 got his degree in Budapest, a un
iversity.  He was an excellent 
teacher, a very famous one, actually.  He got hi
s de gree from English literature.  His doctor 

degree and his special field was predecesso
r of Shakespeare.  Ben Johnson, Marlowe, 
Thompson (?)and all these people. Wh en 
he was young, his special field wa s English 
literature.  La ter, the language teaching, the la
nguages and he was very active.  He taught in 
different courses for adult people, also
 private. He gave private lessons. 
 

Q: He was doing that in the 1930™s? 

 
A: Ye s, yes he was doing all the time. Actua
lly, it was a ________.  He was paid quite well, to 
give private lessons, it was always 
we ll paid.  He retired in ™40 as
 a consequence of the first law 
against Jews.  He retired earlier th
an it would have been necessary. 
 
Q: He was only 55? 

 

A: Fifty-five when he retired, yes.  It was too ear
ly for it but afterwards, he
 was still active but, of 
course, less active.  Not much time left there. 
 He  wrote a lot of gra mma r textbooks which was 
used all over the country for high schools and 
also some  others which would be used by 
everybody.As a matter of fact, it is a shame that in 
spite of the fact that my father was a teacher 

of the English language, I don™t sp
eak it better.  My English is
 not very good, of course, you 
know how it is, being a child, it is always 
difficult to learn from his own parents. 
 

Q: What about his family? 

 

A: My grandfather was also a teacher, but for music. He was a violinist and gave also lessons on 
piano. He studied in Germany withYochim.  
I don™t know whether you know the name . He was 

an outstanding ma ster in the prev
ious century.  He  was one of his students.  He was not a bad 
musician.  He  died when I was fi
ve years old so I don™t have much
 me mo ries about him.  Only I 
know stories going on in the family, that he was 
an awful person, stingy, stingy person.  I don™t 

know, of course. 
 

Q: Did your father have an
y brothers or
 sisters? 

 
A: Ye s, he had an elder brother.  He was an
 employee in a bank in bank work and he had two 
sisters but they died very 
young, not so young, they were already grown up but ma ybe  in their 
twenties.Tuberculosis, one and I don™t  know what
 was the matter with th
e other. Anyhow, I 
only knew my uncle, my father was the youngest a
nd the brother was the eldest.  He was not a 
particularly successful ma n, but he worked. 
 

Q: Yourgrandfather? 

 

A: No, no, my uncle. Thegrandfat
her, I don™t know very muc h.  I know
 that his father had an inn, 
a small pub in old Buda --.That my grandfathe
r could study and studied in Germany, that was 
already something.This way, I just wa nted to 
give you certain background so my education was 
a very intellectual one. Also my mother --. 
 

Q: Did you learn a musical instrume nt? 

 

A: Oh yes, I learned piano.  I studied ten years 
and I liked it very much and I was a good level.  
Some  me mb ers of the family wanted I became a mu
sician.   But I didn™t.  I knew that I am not 
as good in music.  It wa s fun but not a profession a
nd I am sure that I was right.  But I like it 
very much.  My mother, she was born in 1890 and she was a teacher for ma thematics. 
 

Q: Whatlevel? 

 

A: Highschoolteacher. 

 

Q: So your parents me t at university? 
 
A: No, no, not at the university.  I don™t know ex
actly how they me t each other but anyhow that 
was a very happy ma rriage. 
 

Q: Did you celebrate the Jewish holiday
s?   Or observe them, should I say? 
 

A: No, no.  My father had no idea at all about re
ligion and my mother, maybe in her family, it was 
more usual to keep the highest holidays.  I reme
mber when I was a child, she used to light the 
candles on Fr iday evening.  I reme mb er it and we
 had a very nice candleholder and some  of the 
china or some thing.  One day it broke and she st
opped to do it.  It was not a kind of being 
religious, just a 
kind of religion. 
 

Q: They were married in a secular marriage? 

 

A: Oh, yes, secular.  I don™t reme mber -- ma ybe the only occasion when they went to syna gogue, 
that was --  what is the name of the me mory 
of t he parents who died?   OnYo m Kippur, how do 
you call it?   Just a secon
d.Anyhow, religion was not an issue in
 our family. That™s interesting, 
ma ybe I can speak about it, but what™s intere
sting, my mother cam
e -- her father was a 
physician and he came fr om a very simple fa mily 
from the countryside where I think there were 
ten brot hers and sisters. When he was a chil d, they sent it away because they didn™t have 

money. The y told him that he should go toone relative and fr om there to another one.  

Somehow, he managed to finish the university.  
He became a physician.  He had five children.  
My mother was the brightest.  She finished and 
got degree in Budapest.  She was an outstanding 

student and I still have her book.  I don™t know how
 you call it, where all th
e grades are written. 
 
Q: Report card or a transcript? 

 

A: No, I don™t know how they -- ma ybe you don™t haveit. Anyhow, I still have it at home  and the 
best grades whatever students can get, she had. 
 I™m very proud of her, excellent professors she 

had.  Unfortunately, when they ma rried, it was 
in 1914, the war came.Aft e r the war, it was 
impossible to have jobs.A Jewish couple couldn™t have jobs from the state, two teachers. My 

father had the job and my mother was fired.  So
 she didn™t work as a teacher.  Some  years and 
then she stopped.  She had also private lectures
.  Unfortunately she died very early. She was 
fifty only in ™41, just be fore the war.  She was ill.
 I had a sister, an older sister.  She was born in 
1918, May 15 and she could enter the university.  It
 was not easy because also as I™ve already 

me ntioned, there was no law against Jews, however the policy was not to be  accepted.  

However, since my father was a teacher and had 
a lot of friends and connections, he entered the 
university. She studied chemistry but never worked 
as a chemist, a chemical engineer.  She got 
involved, very early, as a student into the co
mmunist move ment. In ™43, there was already 
doings of war.And very ma ny young communists were
 put in jail. She was also condemned to 
three years, in ™43. In the jail, 
she got ill, she got tuberculosis. 
 Maybe that was her luck because 
on this basis we could get her out from the jail 
temporarily and when the Germans came into the 
country, the German invasion in 
™44, the first thing was that 
all communists were taken.  She 
was not registered because she was registered
 as some body who is in the jail so nobody was 
looking for her.That was the way how she escap
ed. Never cured perfectly
 so she was working, 
and then again in a sanatorium and so
 and so.  Finally in ™75, she died. 
 

Q: In ™75?  Wh ere was she during the war? 

 
A: She was hiding with false documents. As I me ntioned, nobody was looking for her, because 
was not registered as a freed person, and so sh
e could get false documents and she could hide. 
 
Q: Where did people hide?   
I know a lot of people hid. 
 

A: It was not very difficult because many ref
ugees came fromTr ansylvania.  She had also a 
document as a refugee fromTr ansylvania and she just -- I don™t  know was recommended or in 

the newspaper -- she rented a room, a private room in a fa mily house. The only danger was that 

some body r ecognized her or was suspicious whethe
r she is a hidden Jew.
 If they called the 
police, and looked after the documen
ts, they are real. It was very
 difficult to check whether it 
was a real docume nt or not because  very often it 
was a real docume nt.  Only fromTr ansylvania. 
 

Q: Did you have to pay a lot of money to get one of those? 

 

A: No, no. The  comr ades gave her.  She was a communist, yes.They helped each other --. 

 

Q: You were not a communi st then? 

 

A: Me? 

 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: In soul I was, only I was not a me mb er, I was too young. 

 
Q: We re your parents leftist leaning? 

 

A: No, no, they were not.  My father was a ve
ry progressive and a very open mi nd but he had 
opinions, you should know everything; you should
 read about everything but you should not 
commit. Don™t go close to anyt
hing.  He was -- you know what 
he was -- free -- very old 
international move me nt.  Fr
ee -- Mozart was al so a --. 
 

 

Q: Ama son? 

 

A: Ye s,yes. 

 

Q: He was a freemason? 

 

A: Ye s,yes. 

 

Q: Oh, well that ™s interesting. 

 

A: Ye s, he was a freemason. 

 

Q: Did he go t meetings? 

 

A: We ll, it was forbidden. It was not allowed, of c
ourse not. Whe n it was allowed, that was before 
the FirstWo rldWa r, then he went, yes.  Maybe
 some where I still have the documents what he 
got ther e. Then after the FirstWorldWar, it was 
strictly forbidden.Then he didn™t go there. At 
least I didn™t know about it–.I just
 reme mber that in our library 
in the third row there, I found 
all this documents and the books about the freemasons. 
 

Q: I never completely unde
rstood, that™s  very inte
resting, the freema sons. 
 

A: I didn™t understand it either. Anyhow, I know th
e ideas were very good, very nice, to help each 
other -- yes, freethinker. That 
was the attitude of my father.  He was very desperate when it 
turned out that my sister was i
nvolved in the communist movement. 
 

Q: He was afraid? 

 

A: Ye s, of course.  One day in the morning at 
four o™clock, was ringing a
nd they came and took my 
sister, you can imagine. 
 

Q: That was in ___? 

 

A: That was in ™43.  It
 was already the war. 
 

Q: But he knew before that, that she was involved? 

 

A: We ll, he knew that she wa s a sympathizer.  But th
at she was so much involved that  --- . Actually 
she didn™t do anything, just were, 
leaflets distributing.That wa s wh
at she did. There were some 
young boys in the group.  If they got two flaps 
from the police, they gave out the name s. 

 
Q: Informers? 

 

A: Informers, yes. The girls never did it.  Only 
the boys.  So they were frightened very easily so 
they gave the name s.  I knew about it so she to
ld me  previously, today they send this one was 
taken by the police so I am prepared tomorro
w I will be taken as well. It  happened. 
 

Q: What was your fa mily life, where did you live in the 1930™s? 

 

A: That™s  also a typical story.  My grandfathe
r was a physician.  My mother ™s father.  I told you 
that my grandparents from father ™s side died very
 early. Also this other grandfather died also 
very early.  He saved some  m
oney and bought a house in Budapest. He had the intention that he 
will live together with us and my parents will ta
ke care for hi m until he lives a full life.  So we 
can live together. What happened before we coul
d move into the house, he died.  He was old 
already but he got leukemia and that™s  very qu
ick. Then the sisters and brothers from my 

mother wanted their part.  My parents didn™t want
 to sell the house and to give them money.  
They agreed they will pay the rest  for these brot he
rs and sisters.  Especial
ly one sister was very 
rude, she made a trial against our parents.  She 
won, of course, because sh
e had the right to get 
the ---.  It was not a ni ce thing. 
Anyhow, for me it was good because ---. 
 

Q: What year was that? 

 

A: What year?  It was in ™2
9.   I was four years old. 
 

Q: How can you reme mber it well? 

 
A: I reme mber the grandfather and the grandpare
nts but the whole story 
I learned only later.  
Actually, for me  it was wonderful because this 
house was in Budapest, in one of the mo st 
beautiful parts, a hill on the dsboodoc
ks.  I was grown there in a gard
en.  It™s a family house.  It 
was really wonderful.  Of course, I didn™t know 
about these problems with my parents. The 
house was too large because it was actually for 
my grandparents from father ™s  side and for 
grandfather from mother ™s side and everybody di
ed and we stayed there alone. Then my 
mother wanted to ma ke some  advantage of it 
and so she decided to ma ke a boarding school 
from it. 
 
Q: Aschool? 

 

A: No -- a boarding house -- a dormitory.  For gi
rls who come and live th
ere -- since both parents 
were teachers, they could help them. They c
ould get food there and the 
girls can live there.  
That was in her mi nd.  My mother had an excellent sense for business, so had my father, as me , 

too, yes, as I too. As a consequence there wa
s this boarding house th
ere, all f
acilities and 
everythi ng, just no girls came, nobody came.  On
e day somebody came, because it was really a 
very nice part of Budapest and the gardens, as
 I told you, and in summer it™s ideal, so one day 
somebody c ame and asked if they cannot get a room
 there to live. Who ha d vacation .  Since 
there were empty rooms, my mother told yes,
 why not?  After a while people came to spend 
their holidays, vacations there. 
 

Q: So it was like a bed and breakfast? 

 

S: More, because they could get a full -- pension, yes. 
 

Q: When was that? 

 

A: That was still in the early ‚30™s. 

 

Q: 1935? 

 

A: ™32, ™33, yes already started 
in ™31. I reme mber all the time,
 it was, I was very desperate 
because it meant that my  mother was involved in
 this business and she didn™t  have time enough 
for me . I was jealous for these guests and I alwa
ys was complaining that well -- to hell with 
these guests and you should care for me . Finally it 
was a very nice time .  My sister wa s eight 
years older than I was and we were very, very cl
ose to each other.  She had a fiancé who was a 

mechanical engineer.  He was very good with me  
and watched interest for signs in me . I had all 

this kind of attention;  fr om fath
er ™s  side, the languages; from mo
ther ™s side, mathematics; from 
sister, the chemistry; from her fiancé, the engi
neer ing; but ma inly mathematics was my fi rst 

interest.  Just I wanted to show that in this 
period, it was very nice. You ask whether we were 
religious or not.  I had no idea 
what it was, Jew or not Jewish. 
The first time I had experience 
in this respect was when I was enrolled into
 primary school and reli
gion was compul sory.  
There was a list and they ask these persons shoul
d go to this room.  I went there and found 
myself in a big room. There were
 all the pupils there, not only fr
om the first grade but all four.  
They started to pray, prayer and I didn™t  unde
rstand a single word. It was Hebrew and I didn™t 

know what is is Hebrew.  I didn™t know what is Je
w; I just saw that some thing different.  I was 
told I am a bright boy, that I™m smart.  I was 
so much confused by the whole fact and I went 
home  and asked what happened.Then they expl
ained me  wha t  it was. This is about --. 
 
Q: Then you studied Hebrew? 
 

A: Then I studied Hebrew, I didn™t mi nd it.  My 
teacher asked me , not me  but the class, well is 
anybody who doesn™t  pray every day?   Since I wa s 
taught at home  that you have to be always 

sincere and tell always the truth and you must 
not lie; of course, I was the only boy who said 
that I don™t pray, never.  She started to ma ke 
reproaches, why not?   I don™t mi nd, I don™t think of 
it. Then, you don™t think that G__ will not think 
of you?   I would have never thought about it!  

Finally as a consequence, I realize 
-- this is what I lear ned ther e -- 
that  in certain cases it™s better 
if you lie. That was my first lesson, not to be si
ncere.  Never left the 
religion, I™ve never denied 
that I was a Jew.  Of course, now
 I don™t.  It™s a different th
ing, that™s  a tradition.  Moskir 
(Yiskor) what I wanted. Have you ever heard what 
is Moskir?   Moskir is
 a part of a holiday 
prayer which is only three times a year, I thi
nk, but most i mportant inYo m Kippur. You know 
whatYom Kippur is.  Moskir, even people who ar
e absolutely not religions, they go to Moskir 
because this is again a tradition, to think of the pare
nts. To pray for them, t he parent s, or  just to 

think of them.  My father who had no idea about 
praying at all, he we
nt to Moskir and my 
mother too just because his parent s went to 
Moskir. You know, you understand the situation.  
This is really, I think you will agree, it is the mo
st important event in all the religion. This is 
really what we were taught. That was my ch
ildhood and then I went to high school.  I knew, I 
was aware of the fact that if I wa
nt to enter the univers
ity, then I have to be the best in school.  
So I was always the best ______ without any effo
rt because it was a public school and all the 
other students were not very brig
ht so it was -- not the best school, yes. It was also not a bad 
one. Anyhow, it was not difficult for me  to be the be
st but I knew that I have
 to be the best.  In 
™43 I graduated in high school with excellences,all the best grades.  
Is it interesting this? 

 
Q: Oh,yes. 

 

A: Ye s, that was also such a competition.  I 
finished second in the high school among the students 
who just finished the high school from all over 
the country, from all the schools in the country.  
There I participated in this competition in physic
s and I got fours, a prize.  So I was among the 
best and it was something.  I hoped to enter the univ
ersity, or if there is 
any chance to enter the 
university, then I can get it because I was the best
 in the school.  But it was ™43 already and we 
had already two laws and it was very
 restricted and so I didn™t  get 
into the university.  I wanted 
to become  an engineer which was even more diff
erence, it was always the most difficult for a 

Jew to be enrolled to a technical university.  
So out of question, well what to do? Then I will 
work, that™s  also a good experience, a good opportuni
ty.  If I want to become  a mecha nical 
engineer, I go into a factory and there I will lear n. I will become an apprentice.  I went  to this 

t_____ in Ujpest, and ---, 
 

Q: Theelectricfactory?  

 

A: Electric factory, yes. 

 

Q: Electric parts factory, would you say? 

 

A: Electric parts, yes.  It was not only for the 
bulbs themselves but also they produced all the 
machines which are necessary to produce bulbs. 
 It was a very good experience. That was in 
™43. 
 

Q: Then you were__?   How old were you? 
 
A: I was there -- I was 18.  One year, almost a 
year I was working there 
but in ™44 March 19, as 
you know, the German invasion came.  Until June, I could work there and my luck was -- I was 

lucky because I had to go into the forced labor ca
mp in June.  Otherwise, as Eva already pointed 

out, people who were working inTung ---, later sh
e will be  taken toAusc hwitz toge ther out of 
population of Ujpest.  Since in June, I was alr
eady in the labor camp so I could escape this 
experience.  Just I wanted to
 tell you, it ma y be interesting, 
March 19 that was my father ™s  
birthday. Then my sister was in the sanatori
um because I me ntioned that she could get ____.  
We  visited her and that was a sanatorium outside 
of Budapest but very close to the border and it 
was a very ni ce place. We went there in the morning and my sister told us what happened, 

because we didn™t know about it, the German
 invasion, but they had the connection, the 
telephone, everythi ng.  She told us you should retu
rn as soon as possibl e because ma ybe they 
will close the border and you should go through the 
woods.  Not the road, the regular road and 
don™t take the bus. We  did it and that was our luck
 because this path in the forest was free, was 
no control.  On the road, the regular road, the 
bus, they didn™t let the Jews anymore enter the 
city.  If they had caught us, then
 it would have been worse. Th
at was the last visit for us both, 
my father to see my sister. As you know, each day and each week, it became  worse and worse.  

In June I had to go to the labor camp, I was 
really happy.Yes, because then there was a 
community, how to say, and I knew that in genera
l the army was not as bad as the gendarmerie.  

We  didn™t know what happened in other countries, 
inAustria, in Poland and so on.  Being under 
the army, we could have more safe and secure 
position.  Of course, it was no assurance for it, 
but in the army there were better pe ople than ot he rwise. 
 

Q: I know that I read that ther
e were actually higher-ups in the 
army who wa nted to protect --. 
 
A: Oh yes, definitely th
ere were excellent people. 
 

Q: There were points when you c
ould have been taken and this 
was kind of a way of protecting 
part of the Jewish population. 
 

A: Ye s, yes that™s very true. {Fe male voice: ﬁT
he young, the Jewi sh population who survived, they 
survived in the army.ﬂ}  In the army, in th
is labor camp.  Not all 
of them, because it was 
depending on the leaders of this.  In general, they 
were not as bad.  That 
was also -- we had to 
work.  I was young and even if I didn™t  have th
e experience in physical work, well it was not so 
bad. 
 

Q: You weren™t brutally treated? 

 

A: No, no, not at all. 

 

Q: It was sort of like being in the ar
my only you were in this labor service? 
 

A: {ﬁThe places were very different.ﬂ}Ve ry diff
erent.  It depended really fro m the leader ship. 

 

Q: What was the name  of the place where you went? 

 

A: Where I was?  In summer, we were in, it™
s a very small place, Chicho___, it™s in northern 
Tr ansylvania. We  were constructing a railroa
d. As ____ for the second lane.  It was very 
important for the war because it was only one 
rail and because of th
e transportation, they 
needed, urgently, a second one. We  were 
building it.  It was summer, we were young.  
Sometimes we told each other that if we knew that
 we survive, then it wouldn™t be so bad, like a 

summer vacation. We  had good food. There wasa very good organization, food.  From this 

respect it was not bad.  It was in summer. Wh
at I thought interesting, 
probably you know from 
history, thatAugust 23, Roma nia we
nt to the Soviet side. That 
meant that the war and the front 
came very close.When we finished this second 
railroad, next week, la
ter it turned out, next 
week another b_____ came  or a group of locals and 
they blew up. What we were -- that™s  an 
irony–we were working so much a nd so hard in summer. Then they blew up. That was a 

change of the whole situation.  It became  worse 
because we went to the front and we had to dig 
this trench a second time . 
 

Q: Where was that? 

 

A: It was between Cluj andTursda. Tuesda isTorda so that™s a familiar. 

 

Q: How do you spell the first one? 

 

A: Cluj?   In Roma nian, it is C-L-U-J. The Hungari
an name  is K-O-L-O-Z-S- V- A-R.This is a very 
fa mous and important historical city. This ma y be 
the largest city inTr ansylvania.  In the forties 
years, it belonged to Hungary, it was attached to
 Hungary.  In this area we were working and it 
was not easy.We  had to work in the night and in
 the morning, of course, attack came. Our work 

was ___. 
 

Q: Only Jewish me n worked on this? 
 

A: No, not only Jewish me n but in our group, we 
were only Jews, of course. There were other 
Roma nians and Serbs, you know, these mi norities 
who were not reliable and they didn™t  take 
them into the army as soldiers. They were in such labor camps.There was a big diff erence 

being a Jew or being a Se rb.  Dange
r always. We  were not there very roughly from the soldiers.  
There were nice officers, nice people. 
 

Q: You had relative freedom of the camp? 

 

A: No, no. We  had absolutely 
no freedom of move ment. We  di
dn™t  have the dema nd for it. 
 

Q: You were just ma rched from one wor kplace to another? 

 

A: Ye s,yes. 

 

Q: What about the food? 

 

A: It was good, yes. 

 

Q: You slept in barracks? 

 

A: We  lived in barracks, yes. Again, it was not 
very comfortable but we were exhausted in the 
evening and we could sleep so it was no pr
oblem. The only problem we ha d was lice. 
 

Q: How long were you digging trenches? 
 
A: We  left this railroad the fi
rst days of September.  October 
10, we were already liberated.  One 
month. 
 

Q: Oh, October 19, 1944. 

 

A: Forty-four. 

 

Q: The Soviet army ___. 

 

A: Ca me , yes. The Roma nians and the Soviet ar
my. Actually, what happened, we were working 
for this trench and I told you in the morning the 
attack came. We  had to withdraw, not we, but 
the Hungarian and the Ge rman ar my, had to withdr
aw their troops in such a hurry, they couldn™t  
get into these trenches. They 
had to withdraw everybody. We  had to ma rch all day long. Now, 
we were very tired because all the night we were
 working, all the day we were ma rching.  In the 
evening we said some  of them, we were kept to
gether, that now that™s  enough. We  have to have 

a rest. We  stepped from t he street into a forest
 and we lay there and we slept there. We  didn™t 
know what happened and it could have been very 
dangerous; in the morning the soldiers find us 
and say you are deserters, right? We  could have
 said well, there was such a turmoil, everybody 
had to leave so we are looking for our battalion. 
We  don™t know where they are.  Our luck was 
that the soldiers were so very eager  for thei r 
own life and security; they were afraid fr om the 
enemy. The only thing what they were concer
ned about was the kitchen and the food. They 
take the kitchen and the food a
nd the storage and run in front. 
 Some  other cases, could have 

happened that they go behind us and if some body wa
nts to step down, then they kill them.  Our 
soldiers were not so every eager for us, they we
re eager for themselves. As it turned out, we 
were left behind. When we stepped down in 
the night, all the Hungari
an and German troops 
left and in the morning, we were there. We  
didn™t  know so we went further by the pretended 
intention to look for our lost battalion. 
 

Q: Did you have a special uniform?  

 

A: No, just --. 

 

Q So you were identifiable as --. 

 

A: We  were identifiable -- we didn™t have to wear 
the stars, the David stars,
 that was a rude thing, 
but we had to wear a yellow ribbon here. That
 meant that we are Jews, they knew it, everybody 
who wanted to know it. We  went in this intent
ion to look for our battalion. We  didn™t find any 
Hungarian or German soldiers but
 in two hours, the first Romanian
 soldiers who were from this 
particular village -- also the 
population told us, don™t be silly
, don™t go, wait here, our people are 
here close to us. We  wer e  there without any effo
rt, we were lucky.  It
 was October 10 and this 
terrible thing in Hungary happened in October 
15 when theArrow Cross people, these ultra-
rightist people took over the power.  
That was that. Then we were 
also lucky, in certain places, 
people were put into pr ison and took time until they 
could figure out that they are Je ws and not 
enemies.  Someti mes the Russians, especially, didn
™t  care for it and they took them some where.  
It was not a security.  I reme mber just tell
ing the joke when we were speaking among each 
other, when we were in this forced labor camp.  I 
always told them as soon as possible I want to 
go over to them.  Most people want to go to B
udapest. What do you want in Budapest?  What 
do you expect there?   It™s  nothing there a
nd ma ybe we don™t find anybody there because we 
knew already that from the countryside everybody wa
s taken. That was also what we expected 

from Budapest.  But if we go on the other side, ther
e is hope to survive.  
Some  of them told me , 
yes and what do you want to do there?  Then I told
 them, well, the worst case I go toAmskin.  I 
will be at  the university as a servant.  It is ev
en better to be a servant 
at Amskin Universitity 
than in _____ {ﬁAmskin is a very very good unive
rsity.  It is a very high Œﬁ}. High -level 
university. They were always laughing, ma de j
okes, poor Pal, he wants to be a university 
servant.  Now, of course, it is easy to laugh about
 it but at the time  it wa
s not so.  Finally, the 
10
th
 of October that we were liberated then we 
went toTurdo. There we got some  docume nts 
and in two days, the first train went to Buchares
t. Then I told,Well, I™m fed up with the war 
and everything.  I don™t want to be here close to
 the front but again most
 colleagues wanted to 
go with the fr ontier to Budapest I don™t  want to st
ay so close to the frontier, let™s go back. I went 
the first train to Bucharest and I waited there until
 I could return.  I returned to Budapest in 
April.  I lived there six months.  I learned Jurm
anian.  I lived with a family.  I was working as 
an electrician in some  private busine
ss.  I was lucky. Personally for me . 
 

Q: Maybe you didn™t go back because you didn™t have any fami l y there anymore?   Maybe you 
didn™t want to go back for that reason? 
 

A: No, no. I wanted to go back.  I wanted to go back -- first of all ---We ll, I di dn™t know what 
happened with my fa mily, that was the only concer
n.  I had to figure out what --.  On the other 
hand, I was only 19 years old,  I didn™t  have an
ything in my hand.  I wanted to study, the 
opportunity to study; the only chance was in 
Hungary where I was at home.  I knew the 
language, the culture and 
I had in mi nd, if I survived, why not
 be there in Hungary?   I didn™t 

have anything, I felt my self as a Hungarian, a Hunga
rian Jew.  I was not a Zionist; I didn™t want 
to leave for Israel.  It was enough for me  the expe
rience in the labor camp, to be together with 
three hundred Jews. Among them there were terribl
e people, I have to co
nfess.  I didn™t  know 
what happened with my father, with my sister, 
with all other relatives. What happened with 
them -- as I told you, my sister was hiding and su
rvived in this way. When she was liberated, 
she went into the Party, the Communists were 
there and she wa s working for them.  My father, 
well in October 15, when thisArrow Cross people 
took the power, five days later, October 20, 
they went from house to house. They lived
 in a ma rked house with David™s star. 
 
Q: Yourfatherdid? 

 

A: Ye s, my father rema rried.  I told you my
 mother died in ™41 but later he ma rried. 
 

Q: Who did he ma rry? 

 

A: Actually, she was a woma n who 
was taking care for my mot her b
ecause my mother was very ill 
for one hour and a half, so she took her --. 
 

Q: One year and a half? 

 

A: One year and a half, yes.  
We  found her and she took care of he
r and you know in this situation, 
how it is.  My father was in very bad condition 
after the death of my 
mother and she stayed 
there and finally they ma rried.  I was very de
sperate because I was 19, and for a 19 years boy, it 
was a disappointme nt that the father ma rries. {ﬁ
You were not 19, but 16.ﬂ} Oh, yes, of course.  I 

was sixteen and it was even worse, being a sixtee
n years boy. What is this age, how do you call 
it? 
 

Q: You were an adolescent. 

 

A: Adolescence, yes. It was a shock, really a shoc
k.  I liked her as a person but I was disappointed 
the fact that my father married so. 
 

Q: Was she Jewish? 

 

A: Ye s, she was.  She was very good to my father. 
 Objectively, I didn™t ha
ve anything against it.  
Later, of cour se, and now I see that it was 
good for my father because it was somebody with 

him. They lived together and October 20, th
eseArrow Cross people went house to house and 
collected all ma les under 60.  Since he was 59, he 
had to go.  He was a very fragile person with 
a very, very thick glasses.  Never in his life, 
was working physically.  Never did any sport.  He 

had to go digging the trenches.  I don™t  know how 
long it lasted, ma ybe thr
ee weeks or four and 
then all these people I mentione
d already were taken toAustri
a, ma rching, walking.  Because 
the Soviet army was very close, 
their last efforts was to take th
ese people.  I me t one single --. 
 

Q: We re they taken by theArrow Cross? 

 

A: Ye s, yes.  Everything was inArrow Cro
ss. The terrible things, probably you heard --. 
 

Q: This digging the trenches, that was not the ar
my  forced labor, that was a different kind of --? 
 

A: That I don™t know.  {ﬁIt was not. 
 It was then theArrow Cross, the BudapestArrow Cross had to 
follow it even in the ar my.ﬂ} Even in the army, ye
s.  {ﬁ Because that was the capitol. They had 
their people everywhere.ﬂ} Everywhere. Actual
ly what they did was a coup d™etat, right?   
Because Hortee was de clared the peace. There were some  soldiers around him. That me ant 
these soldiers are no more reliable.  Only theAr
row Cross people were reliable, so they took the 
power everywhere. They decided what to do. Then
 I me t, when I returned to Budapest, I me t a 
physician who knew my  father and who told me  th
at he me t my father on the road toVi enna 

and he lost his glasses.  He 
couldn™t walk and he was put on to
 a carriage and he gave him a 
shot, just to keep him some how.  
 

Q: The physician did? 

 

A: The physician gave him, yes.  It was a Jewish
 physician who was on the road and he tried to 
help people who were there. That means, I™m sure
 he couldn™t  get to the 
border.  Quite frankly, 
I didn™t want  to know more because why would it 
have been better for me if I had known what 
circumstance s and where exactly he --.  His wi
fe  committed suicide during the siege.  She 
stayed there at home.  Later she escaped from 
this marked house because it became dangerous.  

She went to the house where we used to liv
e. There she was hiding because we had a 
housekeeper there, a Christian woma n who was ther
e, who behaved very, very nicely.  She took 
her, she was hiding there.  But her nerves were not good already, so she committed suicide. 
 

Q: Your father ™s -- you didn™t  want 
to know anymore about your father? 
 

A: I don™t want to say I didn™t  want to know but
 I didn™t find anything out 
and that™s  it.  {ﬁ We  
know that on the border, ma ny people who were, tr
ansferred to the border, ma ny were killed at 
the border.  People ma ybe they couldn™t walk an
ymore or even if they could walk, many, ma ny 
-----were killed.ﬂ} Wr iters, poets. teachers, profes
sors, the best people and just when they saw 
that the war is already over. With their last effo
rt, they killed them en masse.That was the stor y 

what I wanted to tell you. Then 
when I returned home inApril,
 of course, I learned about my 
father, what happened.  I found my si ster who 
was in a sanatorium because her condition was 

not good enough, but of course, we were very glad to
 meet again. That wasApril 26.  In five 
days I went to the university 
and I asked when it starts. They
 told me  that one hour ago it 
started.  I made a case I can get into the first cl
ass.  I went.  Everybody told me , are you silly?  
What do you want to live off?  You don™t have any background. What is your imagination?   

Then I have to laugh because I told you, you are silly
 because if I survive a
ll this terrible times, 
do you think that now I™m going to st arve.  I am ha
ppy that I can fulfill my old desire to study.  
I went to this university. Then, of course, th
e only way, we didn™t have any scholarship, the 

only thing what we had was a Joint. The Jo
int gave me  food, it was so terrible the food, 
horrible it was.  My friends and colleagues learned about my situation and they sent me  pupils, 

students whom I could tutor and soon that was th
e way how I ma de my existence.  It was very 
good, very nice. Altogether, I have to tell you that I was among the few people who were lucky, 

fi nally.  In spite of it all this. 
 

Q: There™s nothing else you __-? 

 

A: On the fa mily, what happened with the fa mily me mbers.  If I try to count how ma ny pe ople in 
the closest family have died ---.  I mentioned th
at the son of the second wife of my father from 
the previous ma rriage, he died. 
 My other cousin from father ™s
 side, his older brother ™s son, I 
don™t know how he -- he didn™t --.  He was not 
considered as a Jew,
 probably because he 

converted early. Anyhow he was in the army a
nd he died in the army. Another cousin from 
mother ™s  side died also on the Soviet front, in
 a labor camp; I told you 
that the husband of my 
sister, they lived seven months t
ogether; he was taken to the Soviet
 front, he has died. All of the 
fa mily me mbers of my mother ™s side, her young
er sister, her elder 
sister and her younger 
brother with their wives and husba
nds were take n toAuschwitz. 
 
Q: That was from the village? 

 

A: The village, yes. They were from countr
yside; from Ka ______, and from Pu _____.They are 
different parts of Hungary. The only cousin w
ho survived is the daughter of the younger sister 
of my mother who was also inAuschwitz a
nd then was taken to Bergen-Belsen where the 
mother of Eva died, but she survived.  She got 
ill, typhus.  Some how, she survived because she 

didn™t want to take the food what they gave th
em. That was her luck because the others who 
took the food, they died.  She didn™t want, she ga
ve up.  But she had a friend and she forced to 
give her tea and biscuit and nothi
ng else.  She recovered and she re
turned.  Now she is living in 
Switzerland.  She is theonly close relative I have. That™s th
e story.  I don™t know whether it is 
interesting. 
 

Q: It is ve ry interesting.
