Q: When were you born? 

 

A: I was bornAugust 5, 1918. 

 

Q: Do you remember where you were born? 

 

A: I reme mber where I was born. The hometown was a 
little town, Bodzanow.  
It is in the vicinity 
near Pluzk, 25 kilome ters of Pluzk. Then the next
 big city on the other side is Ploinzk which it 
was 29 kilome ters. Then another to
wn in between_______________ which is about 17 
kilometers from my hometown. 
 

Q: Sounds as if you were in 
the very center of Poland. 

 
A: Right. 
 

Q: In 1918 was the last year ofWo
rldWar I and you were a war baby? 
 

A: I don™t reme mber the war, but I trust you as 
an historian that you mu
st have been right. 
 

Q: Now how di d your parents come  to be in Bodzanow? 

 

A: They came to Bodzanow in the mi ddle ofWorl
dWar I, close to the end, maybe.  I think they 
came in 1917. The little town of Bodzanow. 
 

Q: Where were they fr om originally? 

 

A: My father was in a town not far fromWa rs
aw called, Radzami n(?). The mother came  from a 
different town, also not fa
r away, its calledVolka(?) 
 

Q: And when did they ma rry? 

 

A: They ma rried 1885. 

 

Q: You were the youngest?   

 

A: I was the youngest.  I reme mber I was told 
my parents had fourteen children.  I was the 

youngest.  I reme mber only, unfortu
nately, only seven. The others
 passed away in between as I 
could reme mber.  One of them, matter of fact, 
passed away in the town, Bodzanow but I don™t 
reme mber.  I reme mber the name my  parents mentioned it.  But I don™t reme mber the history. 
 
Q: What did your father do for a living? 

 

A: When they moved to Bodzanow, they had a bake
ry and I reme mber the bakery, I reme mber very 
vaguely there was a fire once in
 the bakery and the authoritie
s had stopped, they couldn™t bake 
anymore all baked goods, bread and everything else
, but they were permitted only for Shabbos 
to bake the challa, what we call, bread for cha
lla for Shabbos and also we were permitted to 
bake the ma tzos for Pesach. And this practica
lly they ma de a living at the time , then during 
later year s they rented a fr uit garden in the vill
ages, they went out when they barely started to 
bloom and later on around June, July we moved out
 there to keep an eye on the fruit, they 
shouldn™t steal it, which it happened.  Some
 kid came around, some  grownups came  around and 
they stol e some fr uit, so we had to be there to
 watch it. Then we could stay there ‚till end of 
August, beginning of September ‚till all 
the fruit was ready, we took it home . 
 

Q: Do you remember what kind of fruit? 

 

A: Apples, pears, plums.  In th
e beginning was cherries. Ye s. 
 

Q: What was your favorite fruit? 

 

A: My favorite thing was to climb trees to-- 

 

Q: To shake the trees? 
 
A: Not shake. We   couldn™t shake them, because
 if we shook the trees it fell down and it got 
spoiled. We  had to take them off ver y gently.  
Cherries was nice.  In the beginning we used to 
ma ke a double we put them up on 
the ears like earrings.  It was 
a good experience.  It was an 
experience on the way you had to watch to ma ke a 
living. When they come  in some  kids came  
in to do mi schief to steal or to shake the trees
 I used to hide myself, was a little narrow places 
where I could hide, and when the kids came in 
I ran out, I caught some  of them. The y were 
like, what do you call it, the grass what sticks, pois
on ivy.  I used to, if I grab somebody, I used 
to, of you™ll excuse my expression, I used to pull 
down his pants and put him in the poison ivy.  
An this was the last time  he came in to steal the fruit. 
 

Q: What kind of house did you grow up in? 

 

A: The house. We  didn™t have the convenience what we have here in Philadelphia.  Not 
whatsoever.  I don™t even reme mber having any to
ys to play with.  But some how we grew up.  
Ta king the more value of life we always had to
 be on guard because the anti-Semites in Poland 
was very great. When I used to go to school we
 always had to fight.  I had to fight because I 
never run away from a fight. We  used to go in 
the street, two, three boys,
 and were approaching 
us a couple of Polacks, Polish boys, so the one 
who ca me  across in the sides where they were 
comi ng, they always went on the ot he r side, the side that I should always face them with my 

elbow to the Polacks. When they passed by, wh
en I stick out my elbow, they felt it.  So I was 
always like a fighter.  I was a li
ttle boy in the family, but I never ran away from a fight.  Many 

times it happens later on, it was around ™37 or ™3
8 when I was inWa rsaw working, we™ll come  

later to it, so I was sit
ting with another boy in a park, a couple
 of boys approached us and start a 
fight. 
 
Q: For no reason? 

 

A: For no reason. The reason was, we were Jews. 

 

Q: How did they know that? 

 

A: They find out later.  Because they find out th
at we didn™t run away, we paid them back.  Even 
home  we had a friend what they had like a ca
ndy store and the boy was 
around the same  age as 
me , a year younger than me , but we were very 
good friends. Whenever, I™m going one thing to 
another, in the pockets I always had a piece of 
rubber from a tire, the rim from a tire inside I 
always had 15 or 20 inch rubber in the pocket.
 The pocket was open, but it was in the bottom 
of the lining.  Just on every eventuality what 
happen.  So I was going once one evening in that 
luncheonette candy store and a couple of boys 
approached me  and I knocked on the window 
and the other one came out and both of us beat 
him up and I walked in the store in the back 
room. A little while later the parents came in, a 
whole bunch of them, and they want to drag me  
out.  I hold onto the door, they tore out the doo
r and I didn™t gave in.  Something happened, 
police came in, some body called police, and I was sa
fe at the time. We  were always fighting. 
 

Q: Now the house that you lived in, 
was it a house or an apartment? 
 

A: It was an apartment.  It was a house which it 
was there one floor, there was three apartments.  
Four different neighbors lived there. We  had 
one room. And that time wa s the parents, two 
rooms we ha d, the parents, myself, and a sister 
at the time when I grew up. The older brother 
had been inWa rsaw where he worked there. 
 

Q: Did you have electricity: 

 

A: No. We  didn™t  have no electricity. We  had kerosene lamps. 

 

Q: We re the streets pave d?  

 

A: The streets weren™t paved, but
 they were the cobblestones. 
 

Q: What was the language spoken in your household? 

 

A: The language spoken in my household wasYi ddish. 

 

Q: In what languages could 
you and your parents speak?    
 

A: Polish. 

 

Q: And the language in the school was– 

 

A: Polish. 

 

Q: And how would you describe th
e religious life in your fa mily? 

 
A: Religious life as we know now here
 was strict ort
hodox religious life. 
 

Q: Would you say that your parents were
 strict in other ways as well? 
 

A: St rict in every way possible, every way. Th
ey were respected by ever
yone in the little town.  
Ve ry respected and from that respect what I sa
w the people gave to my parents I was giving to 
the other people. Whenever Iv saw an elderly pe
rson was the greatest plea
sure of me  to see the 
person and being able to do some thing for him, like 
to help him cross the street or even later on 
here in the St ates, in Philadelphia, wherever I co
uld help to another pers
on, an elderly person, it 
was a pleasur e.  Because I reme mber the respect wh
at they gave my parents, this was a time to 
give to others. 
 

Q: Now, what did you want to be when you were growing up? 

 

A: There wasn™t , in that town, wasn™t  much to choos
e from.  Either a shoemaker, or a tailor. There 
was a carpenter too.  So, I choose the tailor.  Bu t before I came  to be a tailor, I was about 12 

or13 years old or so, I don™t reme mbe r, I went
 to aYe shiva for around two years to another 
town,Tutusk where a brother of mi ne lived 
and an uncle, cousins, and those days I was 
fortunate to have a cousin.  My
 brother lived in a suburb from 
the town, and a cousin lived in 
Tutusk, very comfortable living they had, and 
I stood with them during the week and for the 
weekend I went to my brother.  I was there for 
close to two years, then later on I came  home  
and I went to work as an apprentice tailor. 
 

Q: There wasn™t  any chance of you becomi ng a rabbi? 

 
A: No, I couldn™t  foresee it becau
se I had to do some work to help my parents the upkeep in the 
house where we lived. 
 
Q: You started to work as a tailor to help ma ke ends meet? 

 

A: Ye s, I didn™t ma ke too much money for a year an
d a half I didn™t  get anything.  Later on, after a 
year and a half they didn™t  have apprentices.  How I learned the trade is a different stor y, 

because when I got there to work there were thre
e brothers working at the same  place. Then 
one some how left and I worked there with th
e two others and one was a good mechanic and 
they didn™t want to show me  anything.  But I have
 to admit myself, I was quick with mi ne eyes.  
Whatever I learned from looking on to see how th
ings were being done. The boss lady one time 
showed me  how to sew in pockets to a pair of 
pants.  Otherwise everything what I knew what I 
learned at the time, I learned from 
looking. This they couldn™t stop m.  
 

Q: So they were afraid of you as a future competitor? 

 

A: Possible,possible 

. 

Q: How old we re you 13, 14? 

 

A: I was about 13 or 14 years old. 
 But things what happened yest erday or the day before most 
likely you forgot.  But things what happened 
around sixty years ago 
like what happened 
yesterday. There was an incident which it happ
ened when I was working.  I was getting that 

time, five lopes(? )  equivalent to
 five dollars a week, and I was si
tting at the machine working to 
the left was the table where we used to press,
 to iron the work. Around the corner from the 
table was the other room where the boss used to 
cut the stuff a nd at that time the boss lady was 
standing at the table, she was ironing an apron for 
herself.The boss said, he said to his wife, her 
name was Marsha, similar to Moishe, he said, Ma
rsha give me  the scissors. And the scissors 
were layi ng on the tabl e just to 
stretch out the hand and around the 
corner to the other room.  So 
she said to me , Moishele, take in the scissors
 to my husband, to______.  So I said the scissors 
are right around the corner, just stretch out the 
hand and she expressed herself to me  not nice.  
Like, I don™t know how to call it, like 
not nice, which I felt it was wrong. 
 
Q: You felt insulted. 

 

A: Insulted.  So after she said that so I said if 
this is the case, if you could insult me  like this, I took 
my coat and I was going out. There was anothe
r ma n working at the time, he said, Moishele, 

they used to call me Moishele, which a lot of peop
le call me  to this day.  He said, don™t  be so 
hard, don™t run away, she didn™t mean anything.  I 
said, oh, no, if this is the case, she could 

insult me  like this, so I went home.  I went home.
  So my mot her, may she rest in peace, said, 
you shouldn™t  have done it. You 
know how mothers always softie. 
 My father, ma y he rest in 

peace, he said, well you did it, you did it.  So I 
went over to a brother of mine which had a 
grocery store next house down.  I was there, a little
 while later the boss lady come s in.  It wasn™t  
far, they didn™t  have no trolley car, it was wa
lking distance. The whole town you could walk 
through it in five mi nutes.  So, she said, I di
dn™t mean anything.  I said oh, no.  She said, you 
know what, I™ll give you an extra lotte(? ) 
a week, like a dollar a 
week, but my husband 
shouldn™t know and come back to work.  So th
is persuaded me  and I went back to work. 
 

 
Q: Inadvertently you were a good negotiator. 
 

A: Ye s, I was always trying to stay on my feet
.  I figured out what™s  right and what™ wrong.  I 
learned that in my house , from my parents, to
 observe what™s right and what™s  wrong. To do 
most of the time  the right things, and I figured
 I thought it was wrong for her to insult me  like 
this and I hope she™ll forgive me. 
 

Q: We re you taught anything useful at 
school when you went to public school? 
 

A: Unfortunately, I went only three gr ades because
 I had to go to work.  I remember when I was 
working here in Philadelphia in a place whic
h they had a bookkeeper and they laid off the 
bookkeeper and the boss lady took over the bookkeep
ing and she was an attorney but she was a 
lousy bookkeeper. Whe n I got the week wages, th
e way I figure, I didn™t  have the full amount 
that was comi ng to me .  Not because she wanted to
 take it off, to cheat me, but a couple mi nutes 
here and a couple mi nutes there she didn™t figure.  
So I told the boss, he said, go see my wife.  
So I went to see her and I told her, this I know, 
one and two is three. You figure it I said I don™t 
know and the way I see it, it™s  not enough money. 
We ll, she said, I said, unfortunately I didn™t 

went to a schooling like you, I just had three 
grade school, but some how the figures I couldn™t 
figure out.  She said, for not 
going through school, you™re doing 
all right.  She admit she was 
wrong.  
 

Q: Now earlier you me ntione d you had so me  troubl
e with anti-Semitism in your hometown in 
Wa rsaw. What was it like dealing it, was it a problem at school? 

 
A: It was a problem in school when I was very youn
g. We  had to fight back.  For no reason at all 
they were trying to antagonize us
 and do whatever they could.  
And we insisted not to let 
ourselves be knocked down. 
 

Q: Do you have any theory as to why they were like this? 

 

A: Not too ma ny, not too many to rely on. 

 

Q: How about business relationshi
ps?  Your father rented orch
ards nearby were these from–.?  
 

A: From Polacks, yes. This doesn™t  mean that 
all the Polacks were bad.  But there were a lot of 
them which they were very very bad. 
 

Q: Did you or anybody in your fa mily give any t
hought to emigrating, leav
ing Poland.  I know one 
of your sisters. 
 

A: Yeah, one of my sisters left Poland in 1929. 
 In 1939 there was the exhibition in the United 
St ates, in NewYork, my sister
 that time was trying to bring 
us over to the United St ates. 
 

Q: This was your older sister? 

 

A: One of my older sisters, Br
iandel(? ) .  She got ma rried in 1925 
and her husband left forAmerica 
and in ™29 she came over to the United St ates an
d in 1939 she was trying to bring us over, but 
some how, in the bureaucracy, or whatever it 
was, she couldn™t ma ke it and that™s  how we 

rema ined in Poland.  My sister, the one who 
was supposed to come  over with me  in ™39, 
vanished during the war a
nd that™s the way it was. 
 
Q: So you were hoping to go toAmerica? 

 

A: At that time, yeah.  But then dur
ing the war it was a different style. 
 

Q: An older sister had gone toWa rs
aw years before, this was Bayla? 

 

A: Ye s, Bayla lived inWa rs aw, but another sister
, the one Hendel, was supposed to come  over with 
me in ™39, she lived inWarsaw too, up to the war.
  She was with my sister because she was only 
two years older from me .  She was still si ngle an
d she was working inWa rsaw as a tailor too.  
And I too, I went to work inWa rsaw in 1936.  I we
nt toWa r saw.  I had a brother there, a tailor, 
he was doing subcontracting, tailoring, and I went 
to him for a while, then I went to work for 
some body else and I worked until 1939, ‚till three 
days before the war broke out.  There was a 
call, that time, for the mo bilization of the 
people who were accepted for the army.  I wa s 

accepted in 1939, it was May or June, I reme mbe r  
when I stood to the Board and I was accepted 
to the army but was never taken.  But then when
 they were talking about the mobilization, so I 
said if I have to go to the army at least I™ll go 
from my hometown and be with the parents to say 
goodbye.  So it took me  a day or so to come  fromWa rsaw to my home town, Bodzanow, 

because the roads were bl ocked by the army, th
e military around, but they never called us.  
Many times we tried to go to the ar my to enlist
 and they didn™t  want 
us.  So that™s  how I 
rema ined in Bodzanow.   
 

Q: So you were in Bodzanow when the Germans came in?  
 

A: When the Germans came in. 

 

Q: What do you reme mber of when
 the Germans first arrived? 
 

A: Right after the war broke out 
before the Germans came in yet to our hometown, we we re trying 
to go toWa r saw. We  he ard they are not far fr
om us, the Germans  , and the expectations what 
we heard wasn™t  good so we were trying to r
un away from the hometown. Twice we were 
running, once we were going toWa rsaw, na
turally, with one road through__________, which 
we couldn™t ma ke it.  Next day we went to 
___________, we wanted to go the other direction.  

We  couldn™t ma ke it because it was cut off alr
eady, so I rema ined in Bodzanow and a couple 
days late the Germans came in and they took over 
the city, the town.  Certain things which are 
blacked out. They came  in trucks, passed by to
wns, which we saw and then they took over the 
place, ma tter of fact they ma de a tailor shop next  
to my brother ™s grocery.  He had to move out 
from the grocery and they made there a tailor 
shop. The grocery my brother took out from the 
store everything what we could. 
 

Q: But he had to give up his grocery. 

 

A: He had to give up his grocery business and time was getting tough. 

 

Q: Meanwhile some me mbers of his family were still inWarsaw? 

 

A: Ye s. Then when it was quieted down a littl
e bit I was going twice, 
took in some  food to 
Wa rsaw to my sister and brothe
r.  I took a horse and buggy with a 
Polish driver and we went to 
Wa rsaw and gave it away the food what we had th
ere to my sister and brother and some  friends 

and then a while later, a week or
 two weeks later, I did it again.  I couldn™t come  back already 
with the horse and buggy, I took like a ferryboa
t fromWarsaw. The fruit we took over to 
Wa rsaw and comi ng back I went with a ferryboat and we passed by a town the Germans 

boarded the boat and they took us off. We  ca me  
to a border like, we landed and they took us off 
from the boat and whatever they found, a pairTf
illin, it was used for morning prayer, and the 
Germans found it and said whose is it and na
turally everybody was af
raid.  So one young ma n 
went over and said it™s  mi ne. Whether it was his or not, I don™t know.  He gave it to him and 

didn™t do anything. So they antagonized some thing 
then finally they let us go back home . The 
ferryboat didn™t go to my home town, it was 
to the next town___________, from there is was 
about 70 kilome ters, so I took a 
walk back to my home town. 
 

Q: Emptyhanded? 

 

A: Empty handed.  But I came in one piece. 

 

Q: Two of your  older brothers, if I™m 
not mi staken, were in the Polish army. 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: They weren™t serving in the Polish army during the war? 

 

A: During the war, no.  One was in the 1922 and th
en during the war he passed away in 1936. The 

other brother he was in the army ™28, ™29 and they didn™t draft him back in the army. 
 
Q: What were your parent
s doing during this time? 
 

A: They weren™t doing anything. They were retired 
and they were afraid to
 get out from the house. 
 

Q; Now, what other changes occur with the German occupation? 

 

A; With the German occupation they took us out to 
work to dig ditches on one side and fill them in 
on the other side, and then the 
other way around.  Dig out the othe
r side and put back in the 
other side. They were taking some  people to diff
erent towns for hard labor. Two of my friends 
they took to a town which called Drubnine,  I 
think.  One got killed there and the other one, 
after a long while, he was able to 
come back home. We couldn™t be
 in the street.  Didn™t let us 
be in the house.  Funny. And we were chased not to work. They ma de like a commit tee which 

for some Jewish people made a committee and they 
had to do their dirty work for the Germans. 
Some  did as huma nely as they could, others we
re doing very harsh dirty work for the Germans. 
 

Q: We re you at any point forced 
to wear armbands or badges? 
 

A; Yeah. We  were wearing armbands, we were 
wearing a yellow patch. Th
is happened right after 
they came, not too long later when they came in 
they ma de us  wear the armbands and a badge, a 
yellow badge. 
 

Q: Wa s this in the fall of 1939, after you came back fromWa rsaw? 

 

A: After I came back fromWa rsaw, yeah. 
 
Q: Everybody in the family wore one of these? 

 

A: Everybody, everybody in the town. That™s how
 they recognized ev
ery Jewish person.  
Whenever they felt to gr ab some one, they grabbe d them. 
 

A: We re you forced to move at any point from your  house? 

 

A: No, no. At one time there was a young fellow wh
ich they took to attend 
their horses. And at 
one time I was taken there then I run away. Th
ey caught up with me  a while later when they 
caught me  back and they stretched me  up on a 
bench and gave me  the whipping.Ta ught me  a 
lesson not to run away.  During the wintertime we 
were taken to work to clean the snow from 

the roads.  Many times there were ditches on the 
roads on the side roads.
  Some people fell in, 
we had a hard time to get them out. And this was going on the living. Then I was taken to 

work in the tailor shop.  So I work
 in the tailor sh
op for a German. 
 

Q: A Ger man tailor shop. 

 

A: A Ger man tailor shop.  Li ke I said it was ne
xt door, two houses from 
whe r e I live, where the 
grocery was. And there I was working the tailor shop until we were evacua ted. 
 

Q: Was there a ghetto? 

 

A: No, there was no ghetto.  It was a small tow
n.  It was within ten mi nutes you could walk around 
the whole town. There was no place for a ghetto. 
 
Q: How ma ny Jews lived in this town? 

 

A: When we were driven out there was about 
1,200 souls. A little over 200 families. About 1,200 
souls, people, Jews. 
 

Q: And how many non-Jews ? 

 

A: Non-Jews, there we
re a couple thousand. 
 

Q: And when you were rounded up to do work on 
the roads and snow and so forth, were you just 
young me n? 
 

A; Young me n, mi ddle aged me n, all ages. 

 

Q: Wo me ntoo? 

 

A: Wo men too.  Sometimes they took an elderly 
person put on hisTa llis andTfillin and put him in 
the mi ddle of the street and they ma de fun of hi
m.  Cut off his beard, did whatever embarrassing 
thing they could do. 
 

Q: Did they ever attack your father? 

 

A: No, no.  He was fortunate, they never attacked 
him.  Either he wasn™t  out, he never we nt out. 
 

Q: We re non-Jews also requir
ed to work shoveling snow? 

 

A: No, just Jews .  Matter of f
act the non-Jews they helped out Germans to chase us around.  In 
large numbers. 
 

Q: We re you ever attacked by the Germans or by collaborators? 

 

A: Ye s.  I reme mber we were at work some wheres and Polish_________ from the Germans 
(striking noise) so they told us to stretch out
 on the ground and they walked over us. The Polish 

people. 
 

Q: They stepped right over you? 

 

A: St epped right over the bodies. I could have helped, I wasn™t  so weak at the time, but laying there 
was nothing you could do. 
 

Q: We re you and your fa mily in touc
h with your relatives inWa r s aw? 
 

A: No, we couldn™t, no letters, no way anything to go through. 

 

Q: So the few trips that you 
took that was the last time– 

 

A: This was the last time when I saw them at the time. 
 

Q: Now the Germans selected you to be their tailor? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: What was that like? 

 

A: It was fairly good work.  I reme mber the bo
ss, so called, a German, I re me mber him from 
before the war.  He lived, there was a village about six, seven kilometers fr om the town, which 

was a German colony.  It was sickening to look at 
him. A dirty, filthy, he was, he was a crippl e 

some how, too, and he was so ugly to look at him. 
 Sickening. Then he became  a big mihaf (? ).  
He ma de that shop.  I worked there, a couple pe
ople worked there, and 
it wa s fairly, you could 
sit, you didn™t  have to go out
side to work in the street. 
 

Q: Did they pay you? 

 

A: They pay.  I can™t  recall what
 they pay. They paid some thing, yes, what the was, I don™t 
r e me mb e r.  
 

Q: Did you get food? 

 

A: We  had food, fairly. 

 

Q: Wa s food be ing rationed in your town? 

 
A: Ye s,yes. 
 

Q: How did your parents eat, how did they get food? 

 

A: We  ma naged some how to get food.  I was a little
 bit of the supplier too.  I helped out. There 
was the parents, there was a sister-in-law, who lost her husband in ™36, with two children.  So I 

was trying to help as much as we could. We  had 
some  people, Polacks, like I said not all were 
bad. There were some  which they helped. Th
ey went out of their way to help.  But, 

unfortunately the ma jority were against us. 
 

Q: What did you ma ke when you were working in 
the tailor shop?   Did you ma ke unifor ms, did 
you ma ke ladies clothes? 
 

A: We  ma de everything, whatever came in. Whatever
 they wanted. This went on for, I would say, 
for a year, ™39, beginning ™40, I would say about a year. 
 

Q: The Germans who ran the town, were they Gestapo, SS? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And your boss was a Folksdeutch (?) 

 

A: Ye s. 

 
Q: And the Germans ran the town? 

 

A: The Germans ran the town. 

 

Q: Wa s there any kind of self- governme nt?  

 

A: There was a self-governme nt, but they 
had to do whatever
 they were told. 

 

Q: Now what you were experienci
ng from the Germans, did it come  as a surprise from you or was 
this what you expected? 
 

A: Unfortunately this was expected. When I work
ed inWa rsaw before the war in 1937 or 38, there 
were, Germany what they send out the people what 
they lived in Germany, they sent  them back 
to Poland from the __________.  So they told us what
 was going on.  Of course we didn™t  want 
to believe it yet. We  said the same  thing, how
 could it be?   But unfort
unately, it didn™t  took us 
too long to realize whatever they to
ld us wasn™t  ( end of side 1)–.. 
 

 SIDE2 
 

Q: We  were talking about the German 
occupation and they weren™t a surprise. 
 

A: No, we weren™t surprised. We  were surpri
sed how one huma n being can do to another human 
being without any reason. 
 

Q: During the fi rst year of the German occupation did they kill people? 
 
A: Not in our home town, no. 

 

Q: Do you know people who were deported to camps? 

 

A: Deported to camps, yes. 

 

Q: No one in your fa mily? 

 

A: No, no one in my fa mily was deported, no. 

 

Q: So what happened the beginning of 1941? 

 

A: The beginning 1941 there were time s  which people us
ed to say like the next
 day is going to be 
the evacuation from the Jewish people.  My father
, ma y he rest in peace, always used to say, 
why try to guess for the worst, or speak up for th
e worst, why do we have to guess it?   So, this 
also I learned from my father no
t to think for the worst, not to
 speed it up, whatever will come , 
there™s nothing you can do.  So in the same  comp
lex, not like a complex of apartments, it was a 
big yard, there were apartments he
re and there.  In one of the apartments they used to come  in 
2:00 in the morning to the place to Doven.  So, one
 morning my father came in early back in the 
morning, it was March the 3
rd
, he said they™re saying again toda
y is going to be the evacuation.  
It was early in the morning.  He got dressed a
nd this was no guess. They were right. The 
Germans we re all around with the Polish cohor
t and to knock on the door to go to the ma rk 

place. The town was, in the mi ddle of the town was a ma rk place, a square, to meet over there.  
We  took very little thing that we could in
 a bag, knapsack, and we were going in town. 
 

Q: We re you told how much you could take? 

 

A: No, you couldn™t take much. 

 

Q: Did anyone have any idea where you were going? 

 

A: No, going to the square was going me, my parents,
 the sister  and the si ster-in- law with the two 
children. 
 

Q: The one sister was with you? 

 

A: Ye s.  So, while we were goi
ng from our house out to the street
 we passed by one street the we 
came to the next street to the right, on the left
 was the Synagogue and one side street, at the 
second street we ma de the right, one side was st
anding the buses, the truc
ks.  In one spot was 
standing the Germans, four, five of them, I don™t 
reme mber, two or three, whatever there was, 
with sticks and whips. Whoever passed by, they hit them.  I was trying to avoid, but there 

wasn™t  no way.  I wasn™t  so much a fraid for my
se lf, but I was afraid for my father. Anyway, it 

didn™t help, couldn™t avoid them, and they hit 
him with the stick and he fell to the ground. 
 

Q: We  should probably end right now. Your fath
er was born when?   He 
was a very elderly ma n. 
 

A: He was about 82 years old. White bearded ma n and they hit him over the head and they hit me  
over the head, was bleeding.  I wasn™t  thinking of
 myself and like in a daze, I reme mb er there 
was a ma n c o mi ng behind us, another group of people, one came  over and helped me  pick up 

my father.  His name  was, it™s worth to reme mb er,YosselVolinsky.  It™s like, they were living 

across the street, it™s like in a 
daze I reme mber him.  He helped me  pick him up and we got him 

in the Square. The whole town was there. Ther
e in the Square we stood 
with the group.  I saw 
an elderly man was beaten to death in the Square. 
 

Q: Possibly a friend of your father ™s? 

 

A: Ye s, it was a friend. They all knew each other.  
But, they beat him to death.  Getting in the line 
so called, so everybody got up on the 
truck they hit them, wherever 
they could, they hit them.  
And going to the trucks we were separated. Wa
s me  and my mother and my father and the 
sister-in-law with the children and my mother an
d the sister got on a different truck.  So this 
was -- they drove us up from the hometown with 
whatever we had, everything was left in the 

house.  Just took a small package, with
 whatever it was I hardly reme mber. 
 

Q: You still didn™t  know where you were going? 

 

A: No, we didn™t™ know where we™re going. We  
drove through a town called, Checkanov.  Over 
there we stopped, the Germans stopped and peopl
e knew from there in the town they knew 
where we™re going. They had an idea where we™re going.  So they throw up on the truck some  

food, bread, Jewish people throwing it. Then th
ey took us to a place called, Dzaldowo.  Over 
there was the same  story. When we got to the ga
te they di dn™t let the people get off, they pulled 
them off, or they hit them and pulled them 
off. And somehow ther
e is a mome nt which 

everybody for a mo me nt  is for himself.  So I saw on the truck ahead of us a young boy like I got 
to the gate and he jumpe d off from t he side of 
the truck to avoid their 
hitting. When my truck 
came over, I did the same thing.  Mome ntarily, while I jumped off I said to myself what am I 

doing.  I left my father there, so I walked ar
ound the truck to the back where they were taking 
them off, I t ook him around my hands and I helped them off the truck and they just lightly 

touched him, and said, go you old dog. They didn™t 
hit him. That™s  how we got to that town 

Dzaldowo, was a camp and over there we also 
saw brutality. There was a young ma n which 
they hit him,  he jumped like crazy, that™s the 
way they hit him.  A couple people got nearly 

killed.This was, we got there,
 I think on a Monday,Tuesday, 
We dnesday, I think on aThursday 
they took us out and they took us to Chestochowa.
  Over there we were spread out in the town 
in different places. There was a ghett
o______________ a big ghetto, later on they ma de a 
smaller ghetto. At that time it was still th
e big ghetto and they located us, Synagogues, 
community centers and I was fortunate, my parent
s were fortunate, because of my father, his 
personality. When they took us to that 
place, the first_________ was the streets in__________ 
like a street. Wa s a Synagogue in the backyard, wa
s a big place, they took us in there and I was 

bleeded.  FromTuesday I wasn™t  cared of. The blood was dried up so there came  in nurses and 

doctors came in and helped us and another person
 fr om there they saw my father also with the 
blood so they took him to his apartment. Then in
Ya ldova  we  got reunited with my mother and 
sister and the sister-n-law with the children we 
got reunited and we got to that pl ace, they took 
us unto the house, which it was fairly, I mean 
it was clean. The day they took us to the 
Synagogue, they put in straw and junk back and th
at™s  where they were laying one on top of the 
other. While they were cleaning up my h
ead wound there wa s a young girl comi ng in and 
helped attend me  to clean me  up_________. And, so
me how she took an interest in me . This 
was in March.  On May the 15
th
 we got ma rried. 
 

Q: This is some one you had not seen before? 
 
A: No. 

 

Q: This was in– 

 

A: This was in Chestochowa. 

 

Q: So you went to Chestochowa, toYa ldodov (? ) 

 

A: No,Ya ldodov, Chestochowa.  FromYa ldodov to Chestochowa.  

 

Q: How long did that
 truck trip take? 
 

A: The same  da y. 

 

Q: So you got there the same day? 

 

A: The same  da y, just a couple of hours.  It wa
s a big hole, and the sanitary conditions, don™t ask.  
Even hard to describe.  Unless you wa nt to know. 
 

Q: Goahead. 

 

A: It was a ditch, big ditch a pole 
was in front of it and another pol
e like in the back in the open 

field. 
 
Q: Who filled up the ditch?  

 

A: We  were only there three days.  

 

Q: Who were your guards? 

 

A: Germans.  FromYa ldodov we went by train toYa ldodov. 

 

Q; There you were sent into the big ghetto? 

 

A: Then we were sent
 into the big ghetto. 
 

Q: And that™s where you me t your wife? 

 

A: And that™s where I me t my wife and we got ma
rried.  But when we got ma rried after four weeks 
or so we were able to contact my sister inWa rsaw and she asked the parents to come  over to 

Wa rsaw, it was in ™41, March orApril.  In 
April they went toWa rsaw to my sister. 
 

Q: They mi ssed the wedding? 

 

A: They mi ssed the wedding. 

 

Q: Just your parents? 

 
A: Ye s. The sister Hendle was still with us in 
Chestochowa. This was inApril, they came  to 
Wa rsaw and must have been inAugust they passe
d away, my parents. They were fortunate to 
pass away ten days apart. The father was firs
t and the mother ten days apart. They were 
fortunate to have a burial. 
 
Q: In the ghetto, of course. 

 

A: TheghettoinWarsaw. 

 

Q; Do you know the date they died? 

 

A: I know the date in the Hebrew date, 
I never looked up in the English date. 
 

Q: What was the Hebrew date? 

 

A: My father passed away eighteen days inAv. 

 

Q: The18
th
 ofAv? 
 

A: Ye s, and the mother, 28, 1941.  It never occurred 
to me  to look up the date, the English date. 
 

Q: So they were in the ghetto for a few months? 

 

A: For a few months. 
 

Q: You don™t know what they died from? 

 

A: They died. Then my sis t er told me because th
ey died in my sister ™s house. They got weak and 
weak and weak and they died. 
 

Q: Meanwhile you have a wife? 

 

A: Meanwhile I had a wife and I lived with 
her by a brother of hers, his name  was Duvid 
Ta nnenbaum.  My wife ™s  name  was  Rose, ma id
en name Ta nnembaum fr om Krzepice. And 
naturally we were driven to work, taken to work
 and one thing I must say, I was one from the 
very few, very very few, fortunate people to be 
together with my wife all the time, since we got 
ma rried, to work together and for a time  wa
sn™t  so nice but unfortunately this was the 
conditions of life, there were a barrack for 
couples, ma rried couples, naturally no ma tter how 
the conditions were, everyone was trying to k
eep up self control, 
self obedience in the 
cleanliness of the fa mily. We  were given a 
long, what you call a bunk bed, a long. We  were 
ma king separations wherever we could to ma ke 
a separation between one couple and another.  

Unbelievable as it ma y s ound, it was a truth. We  ke
pt our dignity as much as possible to keep 
clean, to keep nice, self -respect. We  were t
ogether then when they liquidated the big ghetto, 
which it started on aYom Kippur day, 1942. At 
that time we  were at the synagogue and we 
were told that the ot her end of the city they we
re liquidating the ghetto.  So we were driven out 

from there to a smaller place to live. Then that
 house, where we were, it was still considered 
the small ghetto..  I had a sister of mine there, 
she lived a diff erent part of the city, which I 
didn™t see her anymore, Hendle. And then we were taken to work. 
 
Q: You were still a tailor? 
 

A: No.  I was taken once to air force pl ace. We did there, whatever we did.  I can™t  reme mber 
already whatever we did there.  In the kitchen, 
the backyard, whatever it was, we were gone in 
the morning comi ng back at night. At one time I ran away from the group where they took us to 

work.  I was hiding, why I did it, I don™t reme mb
e r  even. I was hiding in a like a ditch or 
whatever it was and for the day. Wh y I did it
 I cannot reme mber.  But I couldn™t do anything 
and then I got back to the work and they went back and some how snow came . Then my wife 

was working in the kitchen there so after awhile, 
like I said, I was fortunate to be with my wife 
together, like  when it was time when it looked 
bad, they were trying to take the wome n out, I 
went to intervene.  Later on when they were tr
ying to take the me n away, take me  awa y, she 
went to intervene. At that  time when she wa
s working in the kitchen, 
which it wasn™t  too bad, 
at least we had some thing to eat, so the forema
n l i ke, was a Jewish fellow. There were two 
brothers and the wife had three sisters. We  lived in the ghetto, even before the ghetto, they 

lived there too.  Back to back. 
 So they knew us very well.  One of the brothers became  the 
fore ma n and he want to take away the wife, my
 wife from the kitchen, take in somebody else.  
He must have got something from the m.  So I went to him, my  wife went to him, begged him, 

I™m staying here why are you taking me  away?   
So his wife told my wife how long isn™t enough 
to be with your husband together?   Do you unders
tand? That brother gave her hell for it.  How 
could you give her hell for it, how could you say 
it?   But, apparently, time  is doing is own 
course.  Later on she got separated fr om her husba
nd and I was with my  wife all the time.  So 
then everybody was against it so they ma de a lo
ttery to see who should rema in in the kitchen 
and who not.  So, it so happened, my  wife was able
 to remain in the kitchen. Then this was 

going on while we were still in the small ghett
o. Then they liquidated the whole ghetto and 
they took us into the factory, the ammunition factory. 
 
Q: Do you remember when this was? 

 

A: It must have been some time in ™43.  I guess it must have been some ti me  in ™43 when they 
liquidated the ghetto. And so I wa
s working the ammunitions factor
y like I said, together with 
my wife. We  were working -- I was taking ca
re on machine which we were controlling, 
checking the shells for the guns. To the machin
es which controlled the shells, whether they 
were a certain size, everything. 
 My wife was working at the 
machine and I was the mechanic 
on the machine. And that™s  how we spend our time
s in that fact ory. There were times which it 
looked close to the end.  My wife used to ask 
me , ﬁMoishe, what™s that?ﬂ  But somehow, like I 
said before, I learned from my father, may he re
st in peace, not to speed up and not to try to 
guess for the worst. To think positive like. 
 

Q: Ta ke one day at a time? 

 

A: Ta ke one day at a time . Although, it looked ba
d, some how but in the b
ack of my mi nd I hoped, 
ech, it doesn™t look so bad. Whether I believed 
it or not, I don™t  know.  But just to ma ke 
comfortable my wife she  
shouldn™t think the worst. 
 

Q: Positivethinking? 

 

A: Positive thinking. That™s the way I did it. 

 

Q: Did you have any idea who was going to win the war? 
 
A: I™ll tell you, there are so
me  people which they say, oh when I wa
s in that time  I was thinking I™ll 
do this and I™ll do that. To me I cannot it didn™t 
occur to me  what would happen.  Back of my 
mi nd I believed that maybe, maybe something will happen we™ll get fr ee.  But to make plans, I 

couldn™t do it. We  didn™t know what was 
going on. We  didn™t know what was going on. 
 

Q: Had you heard any rumo rs about other camps, worse camps? 

 

A: We heard rumors that when they had to leave,
 they liquidate the camps wi th the people. This 
we heard later on, the end of ™44.  So, ma ny time s  
I heard like this, my wife asked what™s that, I 
said it doesn™t  look so bad.  It ma de her feel co
mf ortable. There were twice, two mo ments, she 
asked me what™s that?  In my wildest imagina
tion I couldn™t see anything good, so I said I don™t 
know.  She didn™t ask me anymore. At one time all 
of a sudden it was at ni
ght, they shut off the 
lights, we we re in the factory, we were working 
the night shift.  It was some ti me  in ™44, the end 
of ™44.  Wh at™s that?  I said, I don™t know, I 
couldn™t find anything, I couldn™t find any excuse.  
Naturally, we thought for the worst. And the se
cond time, which it was the last mo ment before 
we were liberated, she said, we were driven ou
t to the gates fro m the factory with the trains 
were outside and all of a sudden we were pus
hed back, the whole me ss was like pushed back.  
My wife asked me  that time , what™s that?  This wa s when it we nt through the mi nds, this is the 

end. I said I don™t know and she didn™t  ask anymore.
 We  hel d on for a couple of mi nutes, then 
we could spread.  It got over. What it was,
 I don™t know.  Some people were taken out t the 
train a the time  and the bulk of us rema ined.  
There were three other 
camps in Chestochowa, 
ammunitions factory.  I worked ammunitions fact
ory and the day before 
we were liberated, the 

day when we were liberated, to me  it seems to be the 15
th
 of January, ™45. Ye ah, I have to go 
back to a little incident before that. The end of
 ™44 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I 
was a mechanic at the machine. There was one 
Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of 
those machines. We  had there a German boss which it didn™t bother him.  He said you don™t 
bother me , I don™t bother you.  I did some  tailoring for him I did some  fixings for him 

some ti me s.  He was foolish, but it didn™t  bothe
r him any, didn™t do anything wrong. Then they 
took him away and came in another one. They used to call him the mi schugana, the 

crazy_________.  He was crazy, foolish. You coul
dn™t talk to him anything, couldn™t talk to 

him, there was no way.  So the boys said let™s tr
y to bribe him, ma ybe we could persuade him to 
be a little bit.  So we did whatever we could to
 try to bribe him. Whenever he used to pass by 
my wife when she worked at the ma chine, so
me times a shell we would find on the floor, or 
whatever it was he hit he r.  He passed by, becau
se  he worked on the same  shift and there was 

another one, he hit her too, but 
some times he gave her a piece of bread too. And this one, 
whenever I passed by she was crying.  One time 
I passed by she said was it night?   She was 

crying, I said what™s the ma tter she said I don™t 
know, everything was going perfect.  He hit me  
with a screwdriver.  So I go over 
to that boy and I said, listen you
™re trying to bribe him, at least 
let hi m show some  decency. We ll, he said the sl ogan was, if not today, it will be  tomorrow.  

Which it me ant if we won™t be finished today, we
 going to be finished tomorrow. As weak as I 
was I said no, not enough.  I don™t buy it. And 
I find in between two ma c hines, he was a short 
fellow, he wasn™t  taller than me  and I went ove
r to him and I yelled at him.  I said why did you 

hit my wife for nothing.  If you going to hit my wi
fe for nothing, hit me , I™ll be able to take a 
beating, but don™t hit her. And he started bea
ting me  up. Whi l e he was beating me  up I was 
screaming to him the same thing, next time do 
the same thing, but don™t hit my wife.  It™s 

unbelieva ble because he didn™t have to take me  out 
to shoot, to kill, he  could kill me  on the 

place.  But apparently, he  didn™t do it and since th
en he didn™t touch her again. This was before 
Christma s time  ™44, about three, four weeks before. Then the 15
th
 of January in the morning, 
they didn™t took us out from the barracks. We  
rema ined in the barracks.  Like norma lly, we 
used to go out to work. A day before, the evening before, they took out about 700 people from 

the shift from the night before. At that time
 it looked, it didn™t  look good. At one time before, 

like I said I had my sister in Phil
adelphia,America, home I never used
 to write the letters to her.  
But when the letters used to come  she used to live at 633 North 5
th
, Philadelphia, Pa., USA. At 
one time it just him me, came into 
my mi nd the address.  I used 
to say it in Polish.  I took the 
address, I wrote down on a piece of paper, just 
like this. Wh en it looked so bad, I said to my 

wife, you see, here I give you my sis t er ™s  address.
  If we™ll survive ther
e we™re going to meet.  
This happened the 15
th
 of January, the 15
th
.  So in the morning we didn™t go out to work because 
they took out the night shift the night before. 
 Later on around 9 o™cloc
k or so, 10 o™clock, we 
had to go out to the appel and stand up in th
e line and the bosses came around to take us to 
work. We  had one boss which he was fairly a 
decent ma n.  Unfortunately one time he took, he 
killed, shoot a woma n. Whether he was drunk, it 
was a little instigati
on from somebody else 
and he passed by our group and told us in Germa
n, naturally not, it should be noticeable that he 
is talking to us, to take with you _________ clothes.
 To take in the factory.  Like he knew 
some thing, some thing is going on.  So we went in
 the factory, our group, and while we were in 
the factory, I took the coat, whatever my wife ha
d and mi ne, put in a room wherever we had to 
do for the machines, and I™m there for a mi nute or two mi nutes, a boy comes in and says, 

Moishe go out take a look where your wife is.  I 
went out I see her come  in from outs i de. The 
boss who had the shift before, so he want to k
eep his wome n, he want to keep, and send away 

the others.  So she went over to him, it was the 15
th
 of January, it was cold, she said I want go 
take mi ne coat from my husband and I will be 
back.  He said go, but come right back.  So 
naturally I went over to that 
boss, he knew me , not the one who hit my wi fe before, but the 

other one, higher than him, and I told him my wi
fe they™re going to take out, do some thing.  He 
said I™m powerless, there™s nothing I can do. Th
ere was, the ma in engineer from the whole 
factory there, the ammunitions factory.  So the 
main engineer from the whole factory, in normal 
times, everybody was afraid for his 
look. Te rrible, terrible man.  
At that mome nt he stood with 
a stick and he was hitting over the head everybody 
whoever came to hi m. Why, it was plain and 
simple. The y were trying to take out the 
people and people were running back.  Nobody wants 
to go away.  Everybody wants to stay in the place and they we re taking them out and they were 

running back.  So he was hitting everybody over th
e head, wherever he could. And while he 
stood with his stick hitting everybody over the h
ead, unbelievable as it ma y sound, how I did it, 
I don™t know, but I did some thing.  I went over to him and I said, engineer, I™m here from the 

first mo ment when the pl ace st arted, now they™re goi
ng to send out my wife.  If they™re going to 
send her out, I™m going to go with.  I scared him off.
  So he said, where is the boss?   He called 
over the boss, not the one who hit 
her, but the other one who hit 
her from time to time, but he 
gave her a pi ece of bread too.  He said do you know
 her? .  He said yes.  Is she a good worker, 
he said yes.  He said rema in here. Anothe
r boy did the same  thing for a girl and she also 
rema ined.  How I did it, I don™t know.  But it wa
s a rumor just imagination it was, supposedly 
you™re supposed to say they should have left hi
s father that the boy should rema in here.  So 
some how I did it and that™s how we
 rema ined together.  Later on I 
gave her the address from my 
sister and said, because it looked like some thing is
 going to ha ppen.  So I said if we™ll survive, 

there is going to be a place where we me t.  O.K. 
Then we are still in the factory, we we re going 
to lunch to bring the pot with th
e lunch and that time  I went to 
the kitchen to bring in the lunch 
for the group. Then we got a lunch and I sat do
wn on the floor near the machine, while I was 
sitting eating we heard some  banging, to bang a big 
factory.  So I didn™t pay too much attention 

after awhile another repeat, didn™
t pay attention yet, but then 
it didn™t took long another few 
mi nutes we heard more banging.  So I said that 
time  to my wife, because she was sitting with 
me near the machine, I said now I™ll put away 
the food what I had, let™s pay attention what™s  
going on.  So after awhile we saw the Germans th
rough the window, we could 
see that they start 
running. Then one of the German bosses came in and he said to the other one, he said what™s 

going on with you don™t you see what™s doing outside 
already?   St op the work.  So they stopped 
the work and we were driven out to the barracks. There was a factory_________, a munitions 

factory, a bigger one than ours. When the Russians came close to that__________ they 

evacuated the factory and 
it took about six months till the Russi
ans came in that time.  So they 
were told, the rumors we re going on, the Germans 
said they were supposed to leave the factory 

with the people. The factory should be able to
 go till the last mi nute, cause it was a bigger 
factory than ours. This apparently what they di
d.  In our place, in our 
situation the fact ory was 
running until the last mi nute.  But still we were 
afraid that they™ll tear off t he bounty (?) place 
with the people. This was the thought what it ma
y happen. This is what they did in some  other 
places.  So we were in the barracks and around it st
arts to get dark already, one of the Germans 
came in with a sack of bread giving out bread.  
So whoever could reach it got bread. Then the 
commander from the camp start to go around and cal
ling the people said to go with him.  He 
said I was for you like a father, 
come  with me , the Russians are comi ng, come  with me. And 
unfortunately, a couple h
undred people went up. 
 

Q: With hi m?   

 

A: With hi m. And we re mained. 

 

TAPE 2, SI DE 1 
 

A: Around 10 o™clock, at first we were
 in the barracks, then we started to move out to go out from 
the barr acks, after that  incident at the gate, the 
push back was like I said 
before and so we start 
to spread and we were in the barracks, we 
were outside, because we heard the shooting and 
wondered what was going on. Around 10 o™clock the fi
re engines, the fire people from the fire 
engine company they came  around and told us 
now you are free, just wa
tch out from upstairs 
from the planes.  It was only a wild dream to 
be able, I don™t know whether I even identify, but 
subconsciously there was some  kind of hope in th
e back of the conscien
ce that ma ybe, ma ybe.  
This was the mo me nt what we heard, now you are 
free just watch out from the top.  So I still 
had my can with my lunch and it was cold.  So 
some  people did smart things. They were going 
around in the German homes and did whatever 
they could do, take whatever they could. 
 
Q: These home s were empty? 

 

A: The homes were empty, the Germans were out 
already, they were gone. All of a sudden they 
disappear.  Me and my wife, ma y he
 rest in peace, another friend 
just passed away in Israel, we 
kept ourselves together. We  walked and we wa
lked into an apartment building, Polacks were 
there. And at  fi rst they hesitated to let us stay 
there, but we insisted a
nd we did not let ourselves 
be driven out. Till the next morning. Talking ab
out the friend of mi ne I have to go back a little 
while to me morialize him, cause he just passed
 away and we were very good friends.  He too 
was a tailor and while we were in the camps 
in the same  barracks we used to ma ke caps by 
hand, little caps be able to wear it. And my
 wife, if she could fi nd a potato, she cooked 
some thing, so whenever she cooked some thing, whatev
er I ate, I fall asleep.  He used to say, go 
ahead, go to sleep I™ll finish it. 
And that™s  what we did, we liv
ed very close together.  Next 
morning, the morning we went out in the st
reet, because the other guy, he was from 
Chestochowa, so how do we start a life ag
ain, we didn™t know because everything was 
unplanned. We  ca me  into our house, we knocked to
 the door and I said in
 Polish, naturally we 
just came  out and we need hot water. They didn™
t let us in, they didn™t 
let us in.  I went to 
another door, knocked on the door and told them 
the same thing.  See the difference between 
one person and another one, she said come  in. 
 

Q: Polish?  

 

A: Polish.  She said come  in and ma ke yourself comf ortable. 

 

Q: You probably smelled. You had lice? 

 

A: Oh yeah. We  ma de ourselves comfortable.  Ma
tter of fact she went out, she had to go to a 
funeral she said, stay in the house, do whatever 
you want it. And me  an
d that friend and mi ne 
went out shopping see what we could do. We  
saw a woman was carrying a big batch what she 
grabbed from the store, shirts.  So everybody gra
bbed from her, so we did the same  thing.  I 
grabbed a shirt, he grabbed a shirt, then we go see, it was a bakery. We  tied up the two sleeves 

and put in bread, at least we ha
d already some thing to eat. And 
slowly we started to realize 
what we had lost during that time . And we star
ted to do whatever we can to start a life anew 
again. 
 

Q: Meanwhile you probably didn™t know what happene
d to the rest of your family, who s urvived 
and who didn™t? 
 

A: We  didn™t realize we didn™t  know anything that
 was going on.  I had a cousin of mi ne in a camp 

next to us, not far from us, which we didn™t know.  I find out this right after the war, we  find out 
about it.  Like I said we didn™t comprehend what 
we had lost.  Naturally,
 we started looking and 
we™re still looking to this day. 
 

Q: You had a sister inWarsaw? 

 

A: Shesurvived. 

 

Q: How did she survive? 

 

A: It™s one of those mi racles, if there is meant to
 be, no ma tter what it™s  going to be.  She was in a 
camp called Poniatow.  Unfortunately, very few pe
ople survived that camp.  She was there with 
four children, a son and a daughter in that camp 
where my si ster was in another place of work, 
the same  camp, another two daughters. That da
ughter that she was w
ith was doing tailoring.  
She was working for the Germans.  One time she found out it™s going to be a selection to take 

up people.  So being my  sister 
was an elderly woma n then, white, grey hair, so she said to her 
mother, Mom, go hide yourself because there™s go
ing to be a selection they™re going to take up 

people.  So my sister listened a
nd she hid herself.  Fortunately from that particular group where 
they were, they didn™t took up anybody.  So, it 
was good. A while later she come s back again 
and says Mom, go hide yourself they™re going to ta
ke up people again a sel
ection.  So my sister 
says, nah, they didn™t take then th
ey™re not going to take now either
.  She didn™t want it.  It so 
happens they took out my sister.  So the two 
kids went over to Mom and said, Mom, where 
you™re going, we are going.  Mom started to beg 
them said, me , all right, it™s me , I™m elderly 
already, so you™re still young you still have 
a chance.They said no, where you go, we go. The 
other two kids they couldn™t reach because they
 were a different place of work.  So what 
happened, those few people what they took out they
 sent them to a different camp, the remain 
bulk of the people they all got wiped out. That™s
 how she remained alive 
with the two children. 
 

Q: Your sister and the two children survived, the other two? 

 

A: The other two, no. At one time she was inAusc
hwitz. They also found some  people that they 
did some thing and they going to take them out and they going to send them to the 

crematoriums.  She was white, she wa s thin, she 
was grey, her head was tied around with a little 
kerchief and she was running, she said like a 
young chick.  So me how she went through not to 
go to the crematoriums.  She survived. Then from Ger many,  she survived in Germany and 

Belden(?) Belden.  From there, after the wa
r, she went to Israel
 with the two kids. 
 

Q: You had another sister inWa rsaw? 

 

A: We ll, the other sister was with me  in Chestochowa too. 

 

Q: One was in Chestochowa? And 
another one was in, not inWa rsaw? 

 

A: Bayla was inWa rsaw, she was taken fromWa rsaw. 

 

Q: The sister who was with you, you 
were separated near the end? 
 

A: When they liquidated the ghetto in Chestochowa. 

 

Q: The small ghetto. 
 

Q: You didn™t see her again? 

 

A: Never heard from her.. 

 

Q: Wa s there another si ster? 

 

A: No.  One sister was over here inAmerica. 

 

Q: You had a brother. 

 

A: I had a brother, he was inWa rsaw with his family, which I didn™t  hear from hi m.  

 

Q: Not from 1939? 

 

A: When I took over the food to him, toWa rsaw. 

 

Q: Your parents, meanwhile had 
died. You knew they had died. 
 

A: I didn™t know. This I found out after the war 
when I saw my sister.  By then you heard about 
Auschwitz.  How did we  find each other?  We  
find each other through my  sister inAmerica. 
 

Q: The address you had given to your wi fe? 

 

A: No. They wrote to my sister, toAme r ica and 
I wrote to the sist er and 
that brother Josel, who 
lives now in Philadelphia, he also wrote to my 
sister.  So from there we got information about 
each other. 
 

Q: And you we nt toAmerica? 

 

A: And I went toAmerica. 

 

Q: Do you remember the year? 

 

A: It™s  funny, the organizations giving out a year
ly bulletin and everybody of us writes in certain 
happenings.  I mean from the war. 1941, March the 3
rd
, I was driving out from my home town, 
1947, March the 3
rd
, I came into the United St ates. This I wrote in the bulletin. 
 

Q: And your wife was with you? 

 

A: My wife was with me . After the war in Pola
nd I start to write from 
Poland, Chestochowa, to 
my sister. At  one time  in the mi ddle ™45, May or
 June, a friend of mi ne
 heard that he had a 
brother inTheresienstadt, Czechoslovakia, so he 
was sick.  So both of us took a train to go to 
Czechoslovakia.  Just like this, 
like you go from here to NewYork, but it wasn™t  so easy. We  
got on a freight train from__________________ we 
took a freight train to Prague, 
Czechoslovakia, we didn™t  have no money, we 
didn™t have no tickets.  Going up on the train 
was no problem, going off the train they stopped 
us, we were stopped, tickets?  We  have no 
tickets.  So they took us to the station in Prague
, they took us to the Police St ation, so called.  

Ta lking to us about tickets, who knows about tickets. We  di dn™t even know what they were 
talking about. A woma n walked 
in and apparently she saw us taken off at the station. A woma n 
walked in and she asked what was the problem.  
Apparently they told her what was.  She took 
out money, paid the fine and gave
 us some  money 
and disappeared. 
 

Q: You didn™t know who she was? 

 

A: Never knew who she was. 

 

Q: Not even whether she was Czechoslovakian/ 

 

A: Or Jewish, never knew who she was.  She walk
ed away, period. While I was in Prague, we 
wanted to go toTheresienstadt so we had money 
already.  So while I was in Prague I said, let 

me  send a telegram I saw a post offi ce, let me  send a telegram to my sister.  So I went over to 

the post office and asked can I send a telegram.  He
 said yes.  I wrote down in Polish.  He came 
back, no good, got to be in English.  So I took th
e for m with me , telegram blanks, and I was 
going around the streets in the 
station, do you know English, do you read English?   One said 
yes, so he wrote me  down in English, he ju
st wrote down, script.  I came back, no good, it™s got 
to be print.  I took a couple blanks with me  went
 toTheresienstadt cause 
we had to get a train to 
go toTheresienstadt.  Because we had the train al
ready to go toTheresienstadt. While I was in 
Theresienstadt, we found his brother, so I go ar
ound and ask people whether they write English.  
So finally I got some body who said they write Eng
lish.  I told him it got to be in pr int, capital 
letters.  He wrote down the telegram, took f
our weeks I got an answer from my sister. 
 

Q: And that was the beginning of the chain. 

 
A: Ye s, the chain reaction.  But one thing she said
 in the letter sh
e wrote to us.  She said I am 
sending you out ma il, she sent out money and she 
wrote me  and said, one thing I want to tell 
you if you want to come toAmerica you will have 
to work for a living. Another thing she said 
to stay clean not to get involved 
in any false dirty business. A
nd after that letter, you wa nt to 
come  toAmerica you have to work for a living, wh
en she left I was eleven years.  Now I am a 
ma rried ma n.  She felt sorry what she wrote. 
 

Q: Tr eating you like a little kid?  

 

A: No, she said now maybe it™s a different character, 
ma ybe I tried to scare them off.  So s he wrote 
a couple letters after, she tried to apologize.  Bu
t I took literally the way she meant it. There is 
no way to go around with a bucket and a shovel to 
shovel in the gold.  If you want to ma ke a 
living you will ha ve to work. And we kept close a
ll the years till the last  
mome nts of her life.  
Very close.  Like when I came over here I 
lived around the corner, the same block but around 
the corner.  If I had to take the bus in my corn
er, I went over to the next corner to go in the 
store, she had a cleaning store,
 to say good morning and took the bus.  Some ti me s it happened I 
was late and I got the bus right
 at the corner I couldn™t go i
n, she came up to the house, the 
apartment, to see what ha ppened. That
™s  how close we were all the years. 
 

Q: Did she realize what you had been through? 

 

A: Ye s. Ye s.  She realized and she got one son, he was 15 when I came over here. When it came  
in a telegram from the boat I was comi ng in here, 
I sent a telegram to my  sister that we  are on 

the way because she sent to us the papers. And it was on a Sunday when the telegram arrived, 
the letter carrier brought in
 the telegram and the boy was 14, 15 years old.  So he gave the letter 
carrier two dollars.  Because th
e parents weren™t home.. The n when they came home, he said 
came in a telegram from Moishe. That™s it, they
 were happy.  Did you give
 him some t hing?   He 
said yes, I gave him two dollars. They said
 two dollars!  He said isn™t it worth it? 
 

Q: And he hadn™t me t you yet. 

 

A: No. A funny thing when we a
rrived.  She sent us the papers. 

 

Q: Eight years late. 

 

A: Right.  Other people came  in from the HIAS, 
fr om the JOINT, she paid for everything.  For 
everythi ng she paid. The day when we arrive
d, we came into Ellis Island, no, we stood around 

Ellis Island overnight , we didn™t get off the shi
p, because we arrived a Sunday night.  I think it 
was a Sunday night. We  stood a distance away.  In the morning they came into NewYork, into 

NewYork Port.  Right into the port. When we 
got off the ship and the port went through all the 
for malities, the paper work, I started to look 
around. Was a huge hall, a huge building.  But 
some how I looked around and I set my eyes to a co
rner.  I said to my wife, you see this is my 
sister. We  didn™t see each other since 1929.   But we
 got pictures.  I said you see, this is my 
sister and we  start raising hands.  It took a wh
ile, she came down with her sister-in-law for us.  
It was my sister.  Li ke we could feel from
 the distance that™s  a 
sister and brother. 
 

Q: It was a happy ending. 

 

A: It was a happy ending.  It was like I said I was 
from the very few fortunate people to be with my 
wife together. We  ca me  over here she was pr
egnant, six months, and then mi ne daughter was 
born. We  came in March, she was born inAugust,August the 10
th
.  She lived till the 2
nd
 of 
March, 1968.  Didn™t live to see th
e happiness from my daughter. 
 

Q: One day short of March 3
rd
. 
 

A: Yeah.  So she didn™t live to see the happiness 
from our daughter.  But she knew that she had a 
boyfriend. The boyfriend he lived acr
oss the street of us.  He wa
s home a week before, he was 
going to college in North Carolina, what was the name , I forg ot the name . 
 

Q: Duke? 

 

A: No.  I forgot the name  of the college. Anyw
ay he was home  a week before and the following 
week she called him her mother had passed away.  So he came back. The week before when he 

came in he gave her the pin. That™s how mu
ch s he knew this was going to be the future 
husband. That™s  how life goes.  She is a good 
daughter, a good son-in-law and two wonderful 
children. The older one is going to be 17 in 
December and the young one will be 13 in January 
7. 
 

Q: I have to say there™s a big smile on your face right now. 

 

A: Ye s, yes. There™s a song inYi ddish.  Every smile is mi xed with a tear. 

 

Q: I can see it.  Do you have anyt
hing else to add to your story? 
 
A: Anything else to add?  Ye s. There were time
s which we couldn™t  talk about the Holocaust.  I 
think that most of us came  to the conclusion we
 should talk about, we s
hould tell about what we 
lived through and the world population with few ex
ceptions stood silent, callo
usly silent, to the 
annihilation of six million Jewish people. Amon
g them a million and a half children.  Children 
which they never had a chance to see the world w
ith its beauty what th
ey taste the tyranny of 
the people. We  should talk about, especially now
, they are so called educators, they are so 
called educators that they are 
denying the Holocaust. They 
say it only in our imagination.  
Things like this never happened.  How kind of 
vultures can I say those people are. They 
denying the existing of us survivors who went th
rough hell and they know about, but still they 
are denying it. We should reme mber, we reme mb
er, we should never let the people forget what 
we Jews went through, other Nati
ons too, but there is a differen
ce between us Jews and other 
Nations. We  were annihilated for one reason and for one reason only.  Just  because  we were 

Jews. There was said this Hitler may he rest in 
hell, wherever he is, said, if he™ll fi nd a Jew in 
1945, he is going to kiss his head. Thank G-d there 
are Jews survived him, there is Israel which 
hopefully will exist and he is in hell wherever he
 is. We  a long accounting to do with people.  
So called friends. We  hoped that the world will 
realize and help Israel, the Jewish Nation live 
in peace.  Unfortunately, so- called friends are doing ve
ry little to help Isra
el in peace.  But let™s 
hope we are out ma king people hopefully will exis
t for ma ny years to come. And I thank you 
Anthony Di Iorio.  I thank you for comi ng into th
e house and telling my story of life.  Maybe 

it™s not so_______ but it™s  a story of life which we went through.  Many people ma y say, why 

didn™t you fight back?   But there is
 a saying that it is 
always good to be a 
quarterback next day 
after the game.  Unfortunately, this was the story 
with us. There were very few which were able 
to fight back, to resist. The greatest resistan
ce from the people was to exist and try to conduct 

as humanely as you could with all the bad luck 
situations where we liv
ed, conditions where we 
lived, and we  resisted to be able
 to exist and I think this is 
the greatest resistance what every 
huma n being could do. And I thank you again for comi ng. You had a long day. 
 

Q; Thank you for having me .  I probably should say for those who will hear this tape that hard 
necking people, we should sa
y that means stubborn and tough. 
 

A: Right, right.  I just 
couldn™t  bring out the proper word for it.
 There is the Hebrew translation for 
it, Em shay oraf, the heart necking stubborn people. With all the humiliation that we ha d we 

still were able to bring up a second generation nice young people who do take an active part to 

keep up the Holocaust me mory and the me mory of th
e grandparents that they had lost.  It™s  very 
heartwarmi ng for those youngsters to be. 
 

Q: And the rate you™re going, you™re 
going to have a third generation. 
 

A: Let™s hope, let™s hope.        
   (Di Iorio: Thank you.)
