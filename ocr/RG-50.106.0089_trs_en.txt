Ruth Harve y
: 
 My name at birth was Ruth Abel, A-B-E-
L.
 
 

Q:  And your date of birth? 

 

A: October 9, 1928.   

 

Q: And place of birth? 
 
A:  Berlin.

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
2  
 
 
Q: Would you talk about your parents and your grandparents. 
 

A: I only knew m y mat ernal grandparents and the y were gentle peopl e but I also, the y 

were a 
bit forbidding.  The y didn™t  have a great wa y with children. 
 
Q: And their religi on? 

 

A: The y were Jewish. 

 

Q: And your mother? 

 
A:  My mother as well was Jewish. 
 

Q: And what about  your father and his parents? 

 

A:  My father™s father was Jewish but in those days you were German first and then 

whatever religion you were. He happened t o fall in love with a Christ ian girl and 

switched religions in order to be abl e to marry her.  He became a Chri stian. 
 
Q: Yeah, in order to be able to marry her because of her parents orŠ  
 

A: Now this is somethi ng I do not know.  I don™t know.  This was quite a long ti me ago. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
3  
 
 
 
Q: But you were just told that he could not  marry her unless he converted but you don™t 

know why.  

 
A: I don™t know whether it was a must sit uati on or whether it was just somethi ng he 
chose to do. Probably her parents might have objected but I don™t know any of those 

circumstances. 

 

Q: So your father was raised Christian. 

 

A: Yes. Al though secularly really. Observi ng t he major holida ys but nothing much in 
between. 
 

Q: And do you know whether he was Catholic or Protestant. 

 

A: No, no Protestant.   

 

Q: Protestant.  Lut heran or Œ 
 
A: Yes, Lutheran Protestant.   So heŠ  

 

Q: Protestant Lutheran. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
4  
 
 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: And so his family were secular Lutherans and were not very observant, as far as you 
know.  
 

A:  I wish I could tell you. But you know m y father was already 40 when I was born. His 

parents were long dead.  I never knew them.  All I knew was the stories he told me. 

 

Q: And what kinds of stories did he tell you? 

 
A: Well I 
mean
 the history of the fact that he never knew his mother.  Only after she died, 
he heard some aunt sa ying the poor boy and that was actually his first  memory. He does 
not remember his mother. She was the Christian. And hi s father, he was extremely close 

to, very, very, he loved hi m and honored and respected hi m.  In fact all during m y 

childhood not, not a day would pass that he wouldn™t mention hi s papa.  In one nice wa y 

or another.  

 
Q:  So you had an idea of him, even though you didn™t know hi m. 
 

A: Oh I saw photos of hi m.  A very, a man, with very big eyes and worried looking. He 

had been wi dowed so very early and was never remarried you know. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
5  
 
 
 
Q: So your father was Lutheran and your mot her was Jewish.   

 

A: Jewish.  
 
Q: And what was your household like?  Did your familyŠ  

 

A: Well.  My parents were not church goers or temple goers as such. My mother 

someti mes with friends might go to temple for high holy da ys, Jewish high holy da ys. 

But other t han that she never did and m y father simply was not a church goer, although 

he was a very religious man. When I was a teenager I spoke to him once and he didn™t 
answer me, didn™t answer me. And after about five minutes, he looked at me and he said 
I™m sorry I didn™t answer you, I was pra ying. That was his religi on and it was very deep. 

But he was not a church goer. But  he accompl ished miracles as you will later find out. 

And I™m sure it had somet hing to do with his relationshi p he had wit h the higher being.  

 

Q:  And were you bapti zed? 

 
A: I was 
act ually
 bapti zed. And you know I was young child. No, no I mean I wasn™t a 
toddler or an infant. I was already, I can™t remember how old I was.  Ma ybe five, 
something like that. And the y decided that I should be baptized. And we went to Pastor 

Neemuler
™s church but he was not  there. Someone else baptized me but with water from

the 
Rubes spra y
 in Berlin. And I 
remember
 we came home from that and my mother had 
a close Jewi sh girlfriend who heartily disapproved.  She thought it was just terri ble. And 
she told them that. But then she invited them i n for coffee and cake to celebrate. 

 
Q: So this would have been in 1933 abou
t.
 
 

A: Probably.  Or a little later. I don™t know whether I was, I cannot remember what age I 

was.  I might have been older than, probably they might have done it a little later when 

things were beginning to look really bad.  33 was still fairly early, you know. I wasn™t 

aware of what was real l y happening. 

 
Q: But some persecution had started in 1933. 
 

A: Yes and you know you have these roving bands of Brown Shirts, singing anti-Semitic 

songs and torch parades.  A little bit awesome and scary, t hat sort  of thing. 

 

Q: So you had a baptismal  certificate? 

 
A: If I ever had one, I don™t think I ever saw it. Honestly. My mother must, I don™t know. 
I just, I™ve never seen it . 

 

Q: Do you think that if you were baptized t hat one existed.  

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
7  
 
 
 
A: This being Germany, you can be darned sure. The y had document ation for everything.   

 

Q: So you went to school. 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: To a public school? 

 

A: A publi c school until a certain ti me period, later in the 30s.  When Jewish chil dren 

were no longer allowed in public school. And under the logic of the Nazis the y had me 
figured out as being three-fourths Jewish.  So I went for a ti me, only for a time cause then 
we left Germany, to a private Jewish school. 

 

Q: You said they had you figured out.  WhoŠ 

 

A: The Nazi s. 

 
Q: The Nazi s. And how did the y know that you were Œ 
 

A:  It would be like cit y hall. You know. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
8  
 
 
Q: So the y would have traced who your grandparents were. 
 

A: Yes, mm hm, well anyt hing is documented so the y knew exactly everyone™s, t he y 

knew my roots better than I did.   
 
Q: So you had to leave the public schools.  Do you remember that? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And what was t hat like for you? To have to leave? 

 
A: Distressing.  Scary.  All of a sudden I was t aken out of m y, alt hough I must tell you, 
that the public school was no longer a pleasure.  There was one teacher who was very 

anti-Semiti c and was perfectl y beast ly to us Jewish children.   

 

Q: What di d the teacher do? 

 

A: Oh it was just her sharpness and  her nast iness. I don™t remember details. Very quick t o 
slap faces, things li ke that.  
 

Q: Do you remember your face being slapped? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
9  
 
 
A: Yes, mm hm. 
 

Q: And did you tell your parents? 

 
A: Well it was the custom in Europe for the teachers to do that. It wasn™t, I mean, now i t 
would be a shocking thing, but in those da ys it was done.  

 

Q: There were other Jewish children in your class? 

 

A: You know that is vague to me. I don™t really remember any particular Jewish, none of 

us children really paid attention to our different religion. We were just kids together. And 
I to this day I could not  tell you who was Jewish and who wasn™t . I think there probably 
were more non-Jewish children in that class. There ma y have been a handful besides 
myself.
 
 

Q: Did you think of yourself as Jewish? 

 

A: I always thought of m y, thanks to the Nazis, I thought of m yself as three-fourths 
Jewish and one-
fourth Christian.
 
 
Q: And what did you t hink that meant, being Jewish? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
10
 
 
 
A: Being t hree-fourths of one religion and one-fourth of another religion. 
 

Q: So what did Jewish in particular mean to you? 

 
A: I wish I could really explain it to you. Later upon maturity, I realized much more 
aboutwhat it means.
 

 

Q: But as a child. 

 

A: As a chi ld it was just a religion that for some reason wasn™t popular at that time in that  

country. I was just a child. 
 
Q: So you had to leave the public school. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did the Jewish children in your class go wit h you to the same Jewish school. 

 
A: No. I remember going to this Jewish school which was in a ni ce suburb there, called 
Rosentav
, which means valle y of roses. And not really now wait a mi nute. That ma y not 

have been there.  But the lady, m y mother™s best friend whom I sta yed with for a while, 

she lived in 
Rosentav
.  I remember having to take a bus in the mornings to get to the 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
11
 
 
 
school.  I can™t tell you to this da y where it was. But it was a very nice school and 
everyone there was Jewish and t he y were all new faces to me.  So.  

 

Q: Was the curricul um very different from the public school? 
 
A: The one big difference was that I had to learn Hebrew, which was very difficult and of 

course, I never really learned it.  I j ust 
learned
 some of the symbols and how to 
pronounce them and how to read them.  But you know that ti me period could not  have 

lasted very long because I didn™t do that very long. And it was must be shortly thereafter 

that we left. That means in other words, t hat I didn™t leave the German public school. 

Well I left Germany in 39.  Probably 38.  
 

Q: That you left the public school. 

 

A: Yes.  

 

Q: So you were about ten.   

 
A: I think I was nine.  I was ten when I left.  Yeah. 
 

Q:  What el se do you remember from that ti me about what your l ife was like?  

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
12
 
 
 
 
A: Well there was one little instance. I was down, I don™t  know if it was 
Vonnzee
, that 

great big bathing resort , outside of Berlin. I was at the beach.  And playi ng in the sand 

and a little girl came over and she said ma y I play with you. And I was just about to sa y 
yes when she added but not if you™re Jewi sh.  My momm y doesn™t let  me pla y wi th 
Jewish children.  So I said well I am, or you can™t or something.  And that was the end of 

that.  But I remember it to this da y. And I™m now 67. But you must admit that that is, 

others had much worse experiences. And, and even though this was a small thing, it was 

a pin prick t hat lasted.  Let me see what else.  Well you just wanted me to tell you about 

things that  went on around me and my reactions to them. 

 
Q: Sure 
 

A: Well there were Hitl er™s speeches on the loudspeakers in the street s.  I would hear this 

mal e voice shouting and of course his Austrian accent. I never was able to understand a 

word that t he man was shouting. He could have been talking another l anguage.  I didn™t 

understand what he said.  And there were all sorts of things in t he newspapers which of 

course I didn™t read but  I heard my father and 
m y 
mother discussing them at home in the 
evening.  And he woul d you know furrow his brow and be very worried and he alwa ys 

thought that this couldn™t last. This was j ust something that would go away. 

 

Q: This is your father. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
13
 
 
 
 
A: My father.  Sorry, my father.  And he just  couldn™t believe that t his madness could 

stay and they would be talking.  There was a current joke t hat went around in Berlin that  
it ended wi th the Jews and the bic yclists. And the question woul d be why the bicyclists.  
And then the answer would be why the Jews.  And that ti me it was one of the current 
jokes.  It sounds better in German.   And let me see what el se. It was just a general  

feeling of, I don™t know, somethi ng dark surrounding us. And of course, shall I go on 

about when my father left or do you want t o ask me that later.  

 

Q:  Well before we get to that, what was your father™s occupation. 

 
A:  All right. He had hi s own export i mport firm and then he hired a new secretary and 
this was m y mother to be.  And, they, she was his secretary for about four years and it 

was a one man company. And of course no, he had people that worked for him but the y 

were salesmen. It was export i mport and i t was doing quite nicely.  

 

Q: What export 

 
A: I, I remember he had British Yardle y™s so and things like that .  All sort of different 
things. And everyt hing went along well. My parents got married after the y had known 

each other for four years.  I was born the next year. By then it was 1928.  And his 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
14
 
 
 
business folded. Ti mes were bad.  Horrible. And he ended up scrounging around for all 
sorts of different jobs. 

 

Q: Now was the business folding, was that a result of persecution. 
 
A: I believe so.  I don™t  know. I think it was the economic climate. I don™t know if it was 

a depression that had touched Germany.  As well. I™m not  clear about the economic 

reasons. I just know that before I was born, or while I was still an infant this business was 

no longer supporting hi m. 

 

Q:  If his father was born Jewish, was he consi dered a Jew? 
 

A: You mean his father. 

 

Q: No your father™s father was born Jewish. So was your father considered a Jew by the 

Nazis?  

 

A:  Yes.  For the same reason that I was considered three fourths Jewish, he was 
considered one half Jewish yes. 
 

Q: I wondered whet her that Œ 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
15
 
 
 
A: He had been in World War I. He had gotten the Iron Cross, second class and he had 
been a patriotic German and he was 40 when I was born. He had had a very happy young 

manhood in Berlin, enj oying hi mself.  Enjoying life in Germany. And all this came like a 

bad dream and he coul dn™t believe that  it was going to l ast.   
 
Q: So backing up a bit, there was bad economi c times and his business got into bad 

trouble and so then what happened? 

 

A: Oh he scrounged around.  He sold vacuum cleaners. He was a wine salesman. You see 

his great gift was salesmanship. He used t o, his nickname was 
Fredl.
  
The y used to joke 
Fredl
 could sell refrigerators to Eski mos.  He really could. And so he kept us afloat with 
that.And m y mother, whenI
 was older, she went and got herself a j ob at somet hing 

called the 
Palestina Unt
.  The office for Palestine, a Jewish organization, near where we 

lived. And she had a regular office job there, secretarial. And she had that job act ually 

until we left.  Oh, but before she got that, she t ried everything. And I™m going to jump 

ahead and say when m y dad left.   

 

Q: Ok. 
 
A:  She took on a job as a housekeeper for a very nice well-to-do Jewish family and it 

was really nice because there was a young woman there who she became very good 

friends with. And her grandfather, the young woman™s grandfather and her mot her who 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
16
 
 
 
seemed to be a little bit  retarded.  Some kind of emotional  problems.  Her grandfather 
was a marvelous old gentleman and they sort of adopted me as the chi ld of the house, and 

spoiled me. And my mother did cleaning and cooking and it was something she™d never 

done before but she was really great, very adaptable and hardworking, just to keep us 
going. 
 

Q: So she was doi ng this to support you. 

 

A: Yes and  also we started out in a lovely apartment when I was born. Then we went to a 

slightly less wonderful apartment.  And finally ended up i n a furnished room.  Things 

were really, really bad.  We were poor.   
 
Q:  So goi ng back to your father leaving. How did that come about? 

 

A:  All right. This was still before Kristall nacht.  But thi ngs were bad and he was 

struggling and one day a letter came from City Hall to present hi mself in the next day 

with his passport.  And he knew something was up.  He was very intel ligent and aware, 

even though he couldn™t believe that this woul d last  but he knew that things were getting 
dangerous. 
 

Q: What di d he think t hat was all about? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
17
 
 
 
A: Well I™ll  tell you.  At that ti me m y mot her was already employed at the 
Palestina
 
Unt
.  
Yeah, I get confused.  He called her at work.  And he sai d Edith, come home and help me 
pack. Tonight I have to leave Germany.  And he explained that the y wanted hi m to 

present hi mself with hi s passport at City Hall and he knew what t hat meant. The y were 
going to put a J in it for Jew, which would mean that his t raveling would be severely 
curtailed if not made i mpossible. And he decided he was going to flee that night.  Get out 

of there. 

 

Q: Before they put a J on his passport. 

 

A: Yes, yes. 
 
Q: And so how di d he l eave? 

 

A: Well.  I t hink he went to his great aunt Mat ilda and borrowed some, she was t he 

Christian part of the family and quite well  off. And she lent hi m some mone y and he, I 

think he took a train to um, somehow he found -- there was two places he went t o. He 

was in Amsterdam and he was in London, trying to find a steppi ng st one.  I™m a l ittle 
co
nfused where he went first. And then eventuall y he ended up bri efly i n New York to 
gain a foothold. But in order to enter legally into the United States, he needed a quota 
number, vi sa.  And so i n those da ys, peopl e in that position woul d eit her go to C anada. 

Some ended up in China.  In Shanghai.  And he opted or ma ybe it was the only choice he 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
18
 
 
 
had to go to Havana Cuba, to wait  for this and so that™s what happened. In the meanti me, 
we had a 
year
 without hi m. And I must t ell you he was a marvelous cook.  He 
was a great  
cook and he had made a bouillabai sse his last day and I remember aft er he had left, he 

had left in the evening. And I don™t quite know what mode of transportation. He must 
have taken t he train t o Hamburg, to take t he boat over to England, something li ke that. 
There we were with his soup that he had left. And I remember m y m other and I eating 

that soup and the tears were just rolling down our cheeks. And for many, many, many 

years, I coul dn™t stand bouillabaisse. I just couldn™t stand.  Then much later on I 

developed a real liki ng for it because we were together again. That was something. It was 

a terrible shock to have him gone all of a sudden.  But he saved hi mself and he saved us. 

By that action. 
 
Q: So when he left you had some awareness of what was happeni ng. 

 

A: OH a great deal of it . In fact fear was our constant companion.  Because then we had 

Kristallnacht.  November ninth  wasn™t it?  1938.  I believe.  And my mother was a real 

Berliner. There™s an expression in Berlin. If somebody comes at you all excited, we sa y 

Nabublensten 
(German) which means oh so where™s the fire?  You know. So at 4:00 in 
the morning or at 4:30 or 5 there™s a pounding at the door. And m y m other gets up out of 
her sleep. This is some time after my father left. I don™t™ know how long. And all grumpy 

and she goes to the door and opens it and she said so where™s the fire?  And the person 

knocking on the door said the temple across the street is on fire. The Jewish temple. This 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
19
 
 
 
was 
Fazanemistrasse
.  The corner had hotel 
Kampinski
 at it.  That was the last address 
we had in Berlin.  And kitty corner from us across the street was t he, a Jewish synagogue, 
which is now by t he way the Jewi sh Community Center. I saw it in 1978.  They did 

something very smart.  They saved the front of this templ e. It had been a beautiful 
building. The y saved the doorwa y and made a modern bui lding for the Jewish 
Community Center, and put the doorwa y there. It was a striking and very beautiful thing. 

And the strange feelings come back after so many years and see that. But anyway to get 

back to that  horrible ni ght or morning. My mother must have gone out the door t o take a 

peek
 at it. I don™t™ remember. She l eft me upstairs in bed or ma ybe I slept through all of 
this. I don™t know.  And I remember.  She stayed home t hat da y.  And I remember sa ying 

oh how nice. You don™t have to go to work. You™re staying with me. And I remember her 
sad smile and she said but what a reason.  I was too young to underst and the horrible 
things that  were going on around me.  And another really night mare moment was we at 

this time li ved in a furnished room. And I in fact slept on a cot in t he kitchen. It was a 

nice big old Berlin apartment and the lady who lived there was a wonderful old lady. Her 

name was Mrs. Moses. I think her first name was Martha. I™m not sure. She had a 

retarded daughter, a l itt le shriveled lady, must have been in her 40s or 50s, scared me 

terribly because I di dn™t know about retardation. But she was kindness itself, very old and 
tired looking.  And she was very good to my mother and myself. She had some other 
tenants there too. She had her son l iving i n the apartment above her.  And   I thi nk it was 

the da y after the fire or very shortly thereabouts that there was talk of Jewish men being 

searched for by hordes of SA men. You know those were t he Brown Shirts.  And there 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
20
 
 
 
was a brass door sign next to the apartment door.  Outside the front door and it said 
Moses on it. That was her name. And some 
very
 smart person across the wa y sai d, you 
know if I were you, I would unscrew those screws and take that sign off. It™s a very 

Jewish name.  They™re bound to come to you. And m y mother was real feist y Berliner 
always, said oh that™s not necessary. She di dn™t want to do that. And t he reason prevailed 
and the y di d it. And it™s a darned good thi ng because later on we heard these boots on t he 

stairs. My mother and I were inside the pantry.  With her arms around me, shaking like 

aspen leaves when we heard those poundi ng boots coming up the stai rs.  And we heard 

somebody sa y ﬁOh, don™t ring there. There™s no Jews thereﬂ and t hey went on up. I 

believe they got her son, either that time or lat er. And I don™t know. She and her daughter 

must have ended up dead. It was j ust dreadful.  Anyhow, that is a moment that is 
probably the most frightening moment of my life.  And we crept out of the pantry. The 
Nazis had gone. And then shortly t hereafter it must have been that word came that we 

should go to HŠ
from my 
father who had at t his point reached Havana. And, and he sai d, 
he wrote, go to Hamburg. Go to t he Cuban consulate and get all your documentation and 

soon I™ll be able to send for you.  And so m y mother and I took t he Šand early morning 

train. It was still dark, from Berlin to Hamburg. 

 
Q: Now this was right away, the next da y.  
 

A: No. As a child your sense of time is real ly non-existent. It™s fueled by events. I si mply 

cannot tell you. It must have been shortly t hereafter. I™m sure.  And so there we were. I 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
21
 
 
 
thought it was the greatest treat in the worl d to sit in the dining car, a little ship.  No, 
white table cloths and silver and waiters.  And I 
remember
 eating a soft boiled gg and 
looking out the trai n window. I took my enjoyment where I found it you know.  (laughs) I 

thought that was great.  Well then we trudged t hrough Hamburg and we went to the 
consulate.  Everythi ng was fine. It was lunch time. And I was gett ing hungry. And m y 
mother, everywhere she saw a restaurant it sai d Jews aren™t wanted, forbidden to Jews.  

And she was a mot her first and she decided the heck with all of this.  She had young child 

here and she was going to see to it that that chi ld got some lunch.  And so we just walked 

into one of those restaurants and ate. And of course it didn™t mean much to me but you 

can i magine her feeling.  And then shortly after that I was able to l eave the school  and 

happy word came that Œ 
 
Q: Wait a minute.  You weren™tŠdid you go back to Berli n or did you sta y in Hamburg. 

 

A: Oh yes, this was just a trip to get document ation from the Cuban consulate. And then 

shortly thereŠ 

 

Q: So you went ri ght back to Berli n? 
 
A: We went  right back to, to Berli n. 

 

Q: How long was the trip from Berlin to Hamburg? 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
22
 
 
 
 
A: You™re asking me something I don™t know. I™m not, I can look at the map here. How 

far is Hamburg from B erlin.  MaybeŠlet™s see Hamburg.  

 
Q: So you did it i n a day? 
 

A: Oh yes, oh m y yes. It was several hours. 

 

Q: So you didn™t have t o stay overnight in Hamburg? 

 

A: I don™t remember that. It must have just been a day trip, yes.  And so then the 
wonderful word came t hat we would be able t o leave.  And do you want to ask, 
I mean 
anyt hing else. Or should I go on t o that now.  Word came and my mother got ready.  

Prepared everything.  You know now I have t o go back to childhood memories, before I 

continue wi th this.  Let me delve back. You know we started moving from one nice 

apartment t o one less nice, to one l ess nice, to a furnished room.  I remember a lovely 

place we had.  
Geisenhimerstrasse
 is the place. It was outside of Berlin and it was a 
little apart ment wit h a balcony but  it was on t he ground floor. And I remember, at  that 
time I was four years old. And I was just starti ng, having this i mpulse to draw pictures. 
And so I remember sitting at a little table, on a little chair on this balcony. It had a hedge 

around it to separate it from the road. And I would sit there with paper and pencil and 

scribble and scribbl e happy as could be.  I remember that clearly.  The first apartment I 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
23
 
 
 
remember.  In fact, m y first memory was waking up from a sleep and my parents were in 
the next room packi ng and we were going t o Denmark the next day for a little trip. That 

was my very first memory.  I think I was t hree then or something. 

 
Q:  So that  was a happy ti me when you were a very small child. 
 
A: Oh yes, m y parents were m y world. I had no siblings and the y were always absolutely 

wonderful parents.  We had a happy relationship.  Trouble free.  And  that, why did I go 

into that-- oh later on when I came back wi th m y mother  in 78, we visited this apart ment 

because that was the only place that held happy memories for me. It was raining cats and 

dogs and the apartment , the whole neighborhood was now filled with Turkish labor 
immigrant s.  The y, you know you™ve read about the Turks that, and they were having a 
very hard time and foreigner hating Germany you know. And there were these Turks in 

that apartment. We couldn™t make ourselves understood t hat we used to live here. That 

we wanted t o see it. It was a blank. And it was rainy. I felt heartbroken. I don™t know why 

but I felt so sad.  Anyway t hat wasŠI™m digressing here. I went back into the past.  Now 

this, why did I do that now. What was I tryi ng to tell you?  

 
Q: You started to talk about leaving Germany and then you went back to your early 
childhood happy 
Œ  
 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
24
 
 
 
A: It™s not, leaving that neighborhood.  We had to leave t hat apartment because we just 
didn™t, we didn™t have any more mone y. And that™s when the furnished room life started. 

And no I t hink there was one more apart ment, high under the roof, which wasn™t too bad.  

And then came the furnished room. But anyway, the da y that we had t o leave 
Geisenhimerstrasse
, t here was neighborhood Punch and Judy show.  In German it™s 
called 
Ca
spe
la Teata
 and all the neighborhood children were getting ready to sit  and 
watch it. And I had to leave.  I had t o drive away with m y parents. That very time. And I 

felt so bereft, you know. So that was a sad thing. 

 

Q: So it was in many ways difficult for you to leave your home? 

 
A: We
ll that home, yes.  But then later, leaving 
Fazanemistrasse
 to go on the boat to 
Cuba was unbelievable happiness. I was not sorry to leave that Germany. 
 

Q:  Talk about that leaving. 

 

A: All right. I had to, I was never one for dolls but I had a lot of stuffed toys and 

particularly I loved a white stuffed cat, beautiful little white stuffed cat with green glass 
eye, a little pink nose and a moust ache. I l oved it.  And for some reason, with all the 
excitement of packing and getting ready to leave that got left behind. And I don™t know 

whether we were in a t axi to the train or in the train or what. All of a sudden I 

remembered and I said oh 
Mutti
, I forgot the cat and can we go back and she said no, oh 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
25
 
 
 
no.  I mean can you i magine in her mind going back and being snapped up. Of course 
not. But you know to this da y I have regrets about that stuffed cat. And other than that. 

 

Q: Let™s stop here because I have to turn over the tape.  (pause)  This is a continuation of 
theUnited States HolocaustMemorial museum vol
unteer collecti on interview with Ruth 
Harve y. Tape number one, side B .  When we stopped you were talki ng about leaving 

your ani mal  behind. 

 

A: Well, it was not a li ving animal.  It was a stuffed toy ani mal. 

 

Q: And how upsetting that was for you.  To forget that and then you were telling me 
about a painting that you did which you now have in front of you and the title of the 
painting is. 

 

A: Childhood memories. It is so strange. My art teacher suggested a subject 
because
 I 
was at a standstill. She said why don™t you pai nt your chil dhood memories. And it 

unleashed a torrent i n me and it had a very odd result.  I had been planning a trip through 

the Rhine country, a picturesque German towns along the river.  When I got through 
painting this paint ing, I had gotten so closely back into m y childhood self, that I was 
totally unable to go to Germany.  And I changed m y travel plans and went to Greece 

instead.  

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
26
 
 
 
Q: So you had a lot of very strong feelings. 
 

A: Oh m y lord yes, and you know it was catharsis. It just  came out.  

 
Q: To do the painti ng? 
 

A: As I did the painting yes.   

 

Q: Could you describe some of  the things in the painting? 

 

A: Yes, I™d be happy to. Down here you see this cornucopia with the colorful objects. 
 
Q: This is in the lower right hand 

 

A: The lower right.  I™m going to go from the lower right hand.  Now in Germany when 

children reached school age their l oving famili es present them wit h these cardboard 

cornucopias filled with candy. Thi s is a German tradition for your first da y of school.  I 

remember mine was just somewhere, I have a photo of m yself with that in m y arms. It 
was like this big.  And it was filled with candy, and but this year symbolizes. It™s lying on 
the ground with all  these colors spi lled out of it.  And I think of that as my spoil ed 

childhood. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
27
 
 
 
 
Q: Spoiled childhood? 

 

A: Yes.  Spilled, spoiled yes. 
 
Q: Whatdo you mean spoiledchildhood?
 
 

A: Well 
instead of having a normal  childhood, going through the normal  school s in the 
normal way, it took all sorts of odd twist s and turns and humiliations and scares and that 

sort of thing. 

 
Q: And what else i n the painting i s especially important to you? 
 

A: Now you see there a little girl with her arms outstretched floating after a white toy cat. 

That™s the story I t old before, that to this day I™m searching for that.   

 

Q: Over here and you can speak int o the microphone.  

 
A: Thank you, yes.  So that is there. To the right of it is the Punch and Judy show. If you 
look at it very closely t here™s a devi l with a pitchfork and horns. These are all red.  And 

there™s 
Caspela 
or Punch as he was called i n English wi th his stick and his poi nty cap 

and his red nose. And l ater on when I was all filled anew with, wi th fury at what had 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
28
 
 
 
happened, I somehow thought of the Punch as a typical st upid German and the devil 
mai nly Hit ler or Goebbels leading hi m on. I thought of that later, with an adult mind, 

fairl y recently. As a chi ld I just thought of it as Punch and Judy but somehow it fits into 

that painting.  You know, for that reason. Now to the left of this you see a black 
rectangle, wi th a white bulb on the top and you see two shapes. A large female shape and 
a small female shape.  Clutching each other. And that 
was
 m y mother and I in the pantry 
clutching each other in deadly fear.  Behind it you see gra y steps going up and a large red 

swastika behind it. That was the sound we heard of the Nazi boots on the stairs.  Now if 

there™s anyt hing else in here that you want to ask me about.  

 

Q: Is there anything else that is particularly emotional for you? 
 
A: Well all right.  Emotional. It™s both good and bad.  Here you see a gra y ship going 

through the ocean, bravel y headed i n a new direction. And that was the German ship the 

Orenachal 
and m y mother and I were lucky t o get ticket s on that. We were in fourth 

class, steerage.  We were down in a down below in a huge room shared with many other 

women. I t hink there were 40 of them and lower bunks and upper
--
 my mother and I of 
course were together I think it was a lower bunk.  And what she had done, brave lady,  
we had a wonderful oil  painting. It™s right  over there. It™s a self -portrait of a great, great 
grandfather of mine who had artistic talent. And he did this painti ng of himself in the 

earlier part of the 19
th
 century. And so she took it out of the frame because this was the 
one true antique that we had of great sentimental value, a self-portrait  of an ancestor. And 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
29
 
 
 
she rolled i t up and we slept with it between us in a cardboard roll. That was the one thing 
she managed to get out .  You know.  And now it™s hanging there. Anyhow that was a 

pretty unpleasant tri p. I mean the sl eeping conditions Œ t he food wasn™t too bad. It was 

si mple but good.  And I as a child enjoyed everyt hing.  The adult s of course are worried 
sick and uncomfortable. 
 

Q:  You were on a German ship. 

 

A: Yes and in fact there™s somethi ng in t here I™m going to tell you about, yes, because the 

first Œ ok, this here what you see here is Œ 

 
Q: We were talking about the pai nting yeah the upper right hand corner of the painting.  
 

A: And I™m still in the mi ddle here.  There™s a black and white tile floor. There are tables 

with white table cloths, an elegant French door, pal m trees, or pal m bushes in pots.  Very 

elegant salon. Well t here was a lady on the shi p who was a very well to do Jewish lady 

and she was traveling first class. My mother and she were acquaint ed. And one day she 

invited us up to first class for tea.  Now we had been for quite some time down i n the 
hold.  And here I am a little girl. And when we went up t here I heard violin music playing 
and waiters scurrying by with trays.  And I saw all this luxury and it made a very deep 

impression on me. It reall y did.  The next pict ure you see is a man, my father, wearing his 

blue bow tie, white shirt, and gra y pants with his arms raised in the air, and he™s standing 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
30
 
 
 
under a pal m tree and bidding us welcome.  Very welcoming figure. And were we ever 
happy to see hi m. And then it goes on the painting swirls up to t he right above and there™s 

little girls floating around.   Those were the lit tle girls I became friends with once we 

settled in Cuba.  And they were very lovely. And of course I didn™t speak Spanish and 
they didn™t speak German. But I managed to learn both Spanish and English, at l east 
starting to while I had t hat year and a half in Havana.   And the end of the painting at the 

upper right, you see these white towers, skyscrapers. You see the stars in the 
sky tu
rning 

into the stars in the American flag and this was the land of our dreams, which I di dn™t™ 

know yet.  And I saw t hese miracul ous skyscrapers up there and we had to get there. And 

that was the idealized version of it. That pretty well descri bes everyt hing. 

 
Q: Oh that™s a very interesting painting. 
 

A: Thank you.   

 

Q: Can we go back and fill in some of the details of your trip. You and your mot her were 

in the taxi cab going to the train. 

 
A: Or whatever conveyance, yes. 
 

Q: And then you got to the train station in Berlin. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
31
 
 
 
A: Oh that is no, I don™t™ remember those t hings.  
 

Q: You don™t. 

 
A: No, I just remember I have never had a terribly good memory. I just remember the 
emotional parts or the dramatic parts. How I got somewhere, how long it took, this is all 

gra y area. It™s something I honestly don™t know.  At that ti me I was about nine years old.   

 

Q: Do you remember on the ship, the Oronoco, it was a German ship and I think you had 

said it sailed from Hamburg? 

 
A: Yes, to Havana. Oh and we stopped in Antwerp once. All I remember there are houses 
with blue t iles.  We stopped there shortly.  
 

Q: Do you remember on the ship whether you were treated differently being Jewi sh? 

 

A: The German crew for the fourth class were very decent. Nobody ever was rude or 

nasty.  The y were very decent and in fact m y father alwa ys had hi gh regard for the 
Germa
n navy.  Men who were at sea.  He had wanted to become a naval officer but his 
astigmatism kept hi m from that. And no, no there was not one instance of any kind of 
rudeness or mistreatment.  The y were other very interesting Jewish people who were 

professional people who were also down t here in steerage and we enjoyed each ot her™s 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
32
 
 
 
company. And I had photo of that little girl wit h a scarf and a little sai lor doll. We must 
have bought on board, looking as happy as could be. 

 

Q: Were most of the ot her passengers Jewi sh? 
 
A: The people down at that level certainly were. 

 

Q: The trip was as you described it before. Do you remember anyt hing else about  the 

ship?  

 

A: Just a terrific contrast between our steerage and that first class salon with the violin 
mus
ic. It was unbelievable. I stood there thunderstruck. I t hought I was dreaming it all 
you know.  And of course I enjoyed seeing the gray north Atlantic. I had never been at 
sea beŠI mean no I was at 
Von n
zee 
which is a huge lake.  I had never been by the 

ocean. I loved it, I thought it was just wonderful. I™ve loved it ever si nce. 

 

Q: You arrived in Havana. 

 
A: Yes, I have a cute st ory to tell about m y fat her. Shows you what ki nd of a man he was.  
First of all he boarded t he ship wit h a pilot, somehow he wrangled that.  Greeted us all 

(inaudible, outside interference) It was heaven. It was so wonderful. I had always adored 

m y 
Popi
 and it was just shear heaven to be with him agai n and I™m sure m y mother felt 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
33
 
 
 
the same. And then of course he couldn™t™ take us right off because there was a sort of 
Cuban version of Ellis Island called 
Tresconia
.  I think i t means three horns in Spanish 

but I™m not sure. And again with a child™s different look at things, I t hought it was 

fantastic.  And it was this ancient garden with pal m trees.  I had never seen pal m trees 
before and the y were so wonderful I thought. And we had the, real ly unpleasant 
conditions. There were no mattresses. And we slept right on the metallic springboards 

with a sheet  over it, but it was the t ropics. It was very hot and it wasn™t too uncomfortable 

to me.  The only thing I remember eating there was sweet black coffee and red beans. I 

don™t remember anyt hing else. I thought i t was great.  I enjoyed it .  And m y father got us 

out of there within two or thre
e d a ys.
 
 
Q: You and your mother stayed there, not your father. 
 

A: Yes, yes, yes. He had already made living arrangements so he cam e to get us much 

quicker than we had anticipated.  Other people were still t here. I remember sa ying 

goodbye to them and out of sight, out of mind.  I don™t™ even remember anyone in 

particular there. So m y father confronted my mother and he said Edith you have to be 

very brave. Now you can imagine that I couldn™t get something very good and you know 
we don™t™ have any money and you have to be brave. It™s a bit of a slum but at l east we™re 
together. And she said oh 
Fredl
 it  doesn™t  matter. We™re together.  It™s so wonderful.  We 
all happily drove to whatever horrible place awaited us. Well he had had his little joke, 

because 
he had
 rented half of a two famil y house, typical Cuban with gorgeous tile floor, 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
34
 
 
 
lovely veranda.  Rented furniture.  We had rocking chairs. The one thing I remember 
inside was  a tray with tall glasses from Woolworth™s with big red dots on them.  And a 

decanter
 and this, these are the tropi cs.  It l ooked so good and so invit ing and the house 
inside was cool.  And these wonderful old tile floors. Well  we couldn™t believe it. He had 
totally tricked us. We were so happy, we didn™t know what to t hink. He had his little 
joke.  He was so happy too to have his family again. And I must tell you. This is where 

m y guilt complex comes in. While others were having this great sorrow and this great 

pain in Europe and they were going to ghettos and concent ration cam ps, we were having 

this little i dyll last ing some, over a year or so of pure happiness. Of course m y father had 

money worries, but  the important thing is  we were together and we were safe and Cuba 

at that ti me long before Castro, was a wonderful place to be. 
 
Q: Were
 there particular people back in Germany that you were concerned about?  

 

A: My grandparents who were our only cl ose relatives the y had gone to South Africa 

through the help of m y mother™s younger brother who was five years younger than she.  

He in his youth had been a communist, idealistic, and he saw the writ ing on the wall in 

the early 30s. and he had he lit out  from Germany. And he went t o South Africa, 
established hi mself as a businessman  and he became quit e well off.  He™s dead now. And 
he got his parents out.  The y lived there peacefully.   

 

Q: Did they leave Germany before you  and your mother? 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
35
 
 
 
 
A:  I wish I could tell you for certain. Probabl y, probably.  The y didn™tŠI was not close 

to them. They were good people but they didn™t have a knack with children and it was the 

same with m y mot her.  The y were her parent s, but the y were not reall y close. She 
appreciated them but  there was no closeness. And so I™m not quite certain. The y must 
have lef t before we did.  Yes, the y must have because there wasn™t much later after 1939 

you know.  

 

Q: Were there any people 
backin Germany that you 
Œ  
 

A: There was the Christian side of the family who we ourselves didn™t know  too well. 
My father was the cont act there. They were doing all right. I mean I don™t know what 
the y suffered under the Nazis but they were not in any i mminent danger.  My mother, m y 

father™s mother™s maiden name was 
Vogt
, V
- O-G-T or ma ybe it was V-O-I-G-H -T. I™m 

not sure. It was pronounced 
Vogt
, which i n German means abbot. And so they were the 

Christian side and Aunt Mathilda the great aunt, she had married an Abel so she was 

Christian so but her, the man she married cam e from Jewi sh family.  So anywa y it was 

one aunt much later in fact just about two years ago I learned that m y very glamorous 
older great aunt, she was m y grandmother™s si ster, her name was Ida, Eda and she 
married  wealthy im, she was married and she had married a Jewish gentleman. And I 

learned recently that she had ended up in 
Thereiseinstadt.
  I had not known thi s before. I 
was very, very sad. She was Œ I wasn™t close to her either but I knew she was an el egant 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
36
 
 
 
lady, very unhappily m arried. And I remember a stained glass wi ndow in her di ning room 
when we visited. The y had one of those phenomenal Berli n apart ment s you know.  But 

being an only child, we did have some relatives in Dresden who were non-Jewish. The 

boys went into the army. I think they bot h died.  They were an odd family. Do you want 
to hear another childhood me
mo ry.
 
 
Q: Sure. 

 

A: When I was in Dresden. Two, t wo come to mind.  Nei ther one of them pleasant.   
 

Q: I don™t think you have mentioned why you were in Dresden or when you were in 
Dresden. 
 

A: This was obvious, ok this was when m y fat her was between jobs. He was struggling.  

And he wanted to put his wife and child someplace. There was Œ so he decided to leave 

us with hi s relatives in Dresden. So we went t here. The lady was an eccentric.  She had 

about 13 cat s or more and this big old rambling country house in Dresden. She had two 

sons. I remember one of them was called 
Reiner 
and I can™t  remember the other one. 
The y were much bi gger boys. I was just a little kid. And they pla yed two tricks on me. 
The y gave me somethi ng that looked just  like honey and they sai d thi s is good, Ruth.  

Why don™t you eat it.  I was such an ignoramus.  I ate it and it was laundry soap. To this 

day I can remember t he taste. It was so awful. The other thing they di d which di d not 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
37
 
 
 
endear them to me, they would take, put me in a potato sack and move me around the 
garden. Just drag me you know. That wasn™t t oo good.  I was scared to death of them. Not 

having any siblings, particularly brothers you know. And the other thing is I developed a 

t ypical childhood cold and some German fami lies had some pecul iar i deas of how to raise 
children. This woman™s idea of curing me was to tie me hand and foot in bed and put a lot 
of blankets on me to sweat it out of my system.  Well my mother was horrified.  She felt 

like she was very vulnerable. She was there because she di dn™t have a penny to her name.  

Her husband was struggling in Berlin to find a job and a place to li ve. All she had were 

these people. She didn™t want to offend the lady but she didn™t™ want to desert me either. 

So while I was lyi ng there sweating and pleadi ng for her to release me and she was sitting 

there crying. But she di dn™t™ have the nerve to untie me.  This was a very unpleasant 
memory.  And remember this was not done by a Nazi. This was done by what was 
considered a good German 
parentsega
, not my mother but this l ady who was related to 

m y father by marriage. It was her husband who was a cousin of his.  And so m y 

memories of Dresden and it was al so ghastly winter weat her and depressing and I was 

cold most of the  --  it was just si
mplya horrible memory
 
 

Q: So that was a difficult time  
 
A: But let me throw in how Germans think chi ldren shoul d be raised.  I told you how 

close my father was to his father. And his father was a darl ing man who had been 

widowed much too young. He was well off. They had a lovely house. And he had my 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
38
 
 
 
father woken 
every
 morning by a housekeeper coming in and put ting ice cold sheets 
around hi m to wake him up and t oughen him up.  Can you imagine a little boy, half 
orphaned, waking up in the morning and being wrapped up in these icy sheets. Well this 

was the German way of bringing children up.  I™m so glad that m y own parents didn™t™ 
have those i deas. I j ust wanted to t hrow that in. 
 

Q: Let™s move ahead to Cuba.  You said t hat you were very happy  

 

A: Oh it was unbelievable 

 

Q: With your family there for about a year.  Did you go t o school in Cuba? 
 
A: Yes.  I did and t his i s a very interesting thing. I went to a place  cal led Miss Philip™s 

school and it was a pri vate school. My father had done some fund rai sing for the 

American Joint Committee and hel ped many Jewish refugees.  And t hey were gi ving him 

an allowance. That™s who we managed to l ive.  And I don™t know what the financial 

arrangements were for me to attend school , but I went to this lovely A
merican Miss 
Philip™s school in Havana. It was a lovely t ropi cal building in a nice part of town. And I 
was learning both Spanish and English and I Œ 
 

Q: The school was conducted in English? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
39
 
 
 
A: There was a Miss Sema. I think it was English and Spanish. Yes, i t was, I had an 
American teacher, Miss Martha Jane Pruit t.  No, Martha, Martha Jane Jones. She marri ed 

a Mr. Pruitt later.  She was a darling young girl.  And it was, I remember there was an 

older teacher with white hair.  Mrs. Morri s Sema.  And she must  have been Spanish 
speaking.  But I managed with all these li mitat ions in language  t o be the second best in 
m y 
class and I got a silver medal.  I still have it. And a gold medal was earned by another 
refugee boy I remember. A nice pl ump Jewish boy with a marvel ous sense of humor.  

And he got  the first one which was gold.   So these refugee children were really 

outdistancing the l ocal kids. 

 

Q:  Were there many refugee children in thi s school? 
 
A: No. But there were many refugees in Havana.  Yes.  

 

Q: And at home, did your family st ill speak German?  

 

A: Yes, that™s probably why I am now working in the historical divisi on doing 

translations, because my fundamental German is very deep seated that I have not really 
forgotten it  because even in this country, until m y parents™ deaths.  My mother died in 
1984, m y father much earlier, we would intermi ngle English and German.   

 

Q: So German has for you the memories of being with your mot her and with your father 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
40
 
 
 
 
A: I know some very embittered people who have suffered greatly and who when the y 

came to America, refused to speak German. And I respect that and I understand it.  But 

that™s a different situati on. 
 
Q: Well ma ybe we can talk more about that  lat er. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What else about Cuba? 

 
A: I thought the Cuban people  were so different from anything I had seen before.  I 
remember pale faced northern Germans or worried Jewish Germans and great deal Œ I 

was alwa ys cold in Germany, it seems to me and everything seemed to be gray.  Berlin 

seemed to be gra y. And all of a sudden I was on this golden island and with royal pal m 

trees. I thought I™d never seen anyt hing so beautiful.  The sunset s, thi s tropical skies were 

something I™d never experienced before.  The music, the people. They were very warm 

and charming. And at that ti me, happy. 
 
Q: And did you feel any special treat ment as a Jew? 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
41
 
 
 
 
A: The y couldn™t have been nicer to us. The y were so good and hospitable and 

welcoming.   

 
Q: How did you happen to leave Cuba? 
 

A: Oh that was because our quota number came up. We had done our wait. I was 

heartbroken.  I remember the day we sailed away.  My parents had locked me int o a cabin 

because I had been asleep when they left and t hey didn™t want me to be in any danger.  

And I remember waking up as the ship was sai ling awa y and I was looking at the 

Monicone.
 It™s that great stretch of road that™s the first thing you see when you come to 
Havana harbor.  And the lights twinkling like pearl necklace and I wanted to go on deck.  

And I coul dn™t.  The door was locked.  And I remember standing at that porthole and 

sobbing because I didn™t want to leave Cuba.  The people I knew.  My li ttle girlfriends. I 

was distraught. 

 

Q: So you did make friends in Cuba? 

 
A: Oh in fact just a few months ago, I visited one of them 
whois now alady my
 age in 
her late 60s.  Living in Florida. That was my dear friend Hilda whom I had met then. She 
was then a very beautiful little girl  with her own problems. Her parents had divorced. But 

she was a well upper crust Cuban. I mean a very well, they were weal
thy.

Q: So she was not  a refugee? 

 

A: She was an only child like myself and I fascinated her 
because
 I was a refugee and so 
we became friends and it™s a lifelong friendship. 

 

Q: So it was hard for you to say goodbye to Hilda and it was and your other friends. 

 

A: It was agonizing.  Yes. 

 

Q: Why did your parents want to come to the US instead  of staying i n Cuba? 
 

A: Oh because there was no future for us in Cuba.  It was a marvel ous resting, stopping 

off place, better than we ever hoped for or expected.  But it was not a place to remain. 

There was no way you could make a living or anyt hing. We were set to become 

Americans. 

 

Q: Did your family have contacts in the United States?  
 
A: Wellhe hadhad connections withthis 
Joi nt Committee and we quickly found work 
but it was a terrible struggle. I once wrote an essay about  my father. And I gave it to my 

children in which I explained how it was for him.  Here he was at this point in his 50s, 

Interview with Ruth Harvey

and he looked for any kind of job.  Salesman. He worked at the Savoy Plaza Hot el in the 
basement as sort of jani torial worki ng. There he was once a well set up gentleman with 

his little fortune. And here he was now pract icall y a janitor and guys half his age who 

referred to hi m as he y Al, you know. And it was a great come down or I don™t know but 
he was very gallant about the whole thing. He got used to it. He struggled with i t. He put 
up with it.  He fought and he finally ended up creating his own position with a German 

language newspaper, the 
Sta ts Sanctunk und Hera ld   
(German), a Knight Ri dder paper 

and he found a job in their advertising department.  And with his contacts back i n 

Germany and his knowledge of German, he became the advertising director for the ads 

from Germany, big industry ads.  And I wanted to explai n how it was possible for hi m to 

go back to Germany on business t rips after all that had happened. And this was of course 
after the war when Germany was being built up again. He knew the high commi ssioner 
and he had contacts from business before.  And he managed to get some fabulous ads for 

the paper and he did thi s twice a year for seven years until he died of lung cancer.  And 

the wa y that  he could do this, as I explained before is that he had had 40, al most up to Œ 

no more than 40, mid 40s.  He had had a good life in Germany. This was a nightmare that 

came upon hi m in middle age and he had had to adjust to it.  He had t o understand it 

wasn™t goi ng to go away.  That he had to get away from t here. He had not been in the 
camps. He had not had the experience. And so he was able to come back and deal with 
the post war Germans.   He was not eaten up by hatred or revulsion li ke so many  

rightfull y were.  You know. And so he could do this.  

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey

Q: Can we back up a bit to your arrival in t he New York.  Do you remember that? 
 

A: Oh yes. He had a good friend in New York.  His name was Eric Goodall.  For a while 

he was a political cartoonist and he, the very first night, he took us around in his car. I 
remember drove us to Little Italy where all the lights were lit and oh first the skyscrapers 
down Fifth Avenue. And I was a little child. It was an open converti ble and I lai d back 

and just looked up at the skyscrapers and the bright light s in Litt le Ital y and all over. And 

I remember falling asleep, leaning back wit h m y mouth open. That™s m y first ni ght in 

New York.  My father, as we were going down Broadwa y on that first  da y, stopped at 

77
th
 street and Broadway. At the corner there was a hotel called the Benjamin Franklin.  I 
looked recently and the building is still there, but it™s no longer the Benjamin Franklin. 
It™s been rebuilt as something else.  It was a residential hotel and he rented us a nice large 
room with kitchen privileges for that first night. And we l ived there for some months.   

And so our arrival i n New York was very pleasant
.Ihad m y parents with meand m y 

father had his good friend there. And getti ng acquainted with New York. And t hen I went 

to public school and that of course was a li ttle frightening but I got used to it. 

 

Q: So you were about 12? 
 
A:  11 I think. Wait. We arrived in 1940. I was born in 28.  12. 

 

Q: And how was your English by this time? 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
45
 
 
 
 
A: Oh it was so good. I remember being in public school and I asked what is a bra. And 

this girl™s l augh and sai d imagine Ruthie Abel not knowing what bra means.  I di dn™t™ 

know that it was a brassiere.  I was still too young for that but girls were talking about it.  
And there were words I just didn™t ™ know yet.  I had to learn them and eventually I 
realized that I was beginning to think in English and that I had really gotten good at it, 

but it took a few 
years
.  Not too long because I was young. My mother although she had a 
very good knowledge of structure of the language. Had an accent that is so thick you 

could cut it with a knife.  She never 
mastered the 
T-H™s.   
 

Q: was she home during the da y 
 
A: She worked. 

 

Q: She did 

 

A:  I was sort of a latch ke y child for quite a while. 

 
Q: what did she do? 
 

A: Secretarial mostly.  She was a very good secretary. In those days 
secretary
 was not a 
dirty word. Now it is. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
46
 
 
 
 
Q: So she was out  with the public and had to use her English  every day. 

  
A: Yes, oh yes, but she also managed to work for many refugee firms where 
the y all 
spoke German                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                             
      
                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                       
 
 
Q: She use d German at work a lot of the ti mes. 

 

A: Yes, different 
jobs yes. 
 
 

Q: So you went through school in New York. What schools did you go to in New York? 
 
A: It was a public school   in the neighborhood there and I was just getting, I was getting 

adjusted to the American wa y of life and Œ 

 

Q: How was it making friends? 

 

A:  I made a few good ones, not too many.  Ki ndred spirit s and in fact one of them, Vera, 
was a refugee.  In fact she™s in C hicago now. For many years she taught heart at the 
University of Chicago and her father came from Danzig.  And Russian background. 

Lovely girl.  I became very good friends. And then there was a darl ing Irish American Ji ll 

Interview with Ruth Harvey

McConnell . She became m y best friend. She was from the neighborhood.  She in fact 
she™s the one who gave me m y mi ddle name. 

 

Q: Which was?
 
 

A:  Andrea.  What happened was after five years m y parents had the opportunity to get 

their citizenship. In fact we went and swore the oath and t he y made a big dinner 

afterwards and celebrat ed. I, as their child. Aut omatically became a citizen. And I was 

told that when you become a citizen you can have a choice at what  name you want and 

well I have always been upset at the fact that I had one name only and that was only one 

syllable.  
Rutt.
 It just wasn™t Œ that™s how it was pronounced in Germany,  
Rutt.
  I 
didn™t™ like it. It wasn™t  enough for me. I di dn™t feel like just Ruth. You know or Ruth and 
so she and I took a walk on Riverside Dri ve because I told her I want ed to get a middle 

name. And I realized that 
every
 American I knew had a mi ddle name. I only had one and 
it was only one syl lable  so I said Jill will  you help me find a name.  So we walked and 

we started with the A™s naturally.  We didn™t get very far because when she said Andrea, 

I said sa y t hat again.  And she said Andrea. And I said I li ke it.   

 
Q: What di d you li ke about Andrea? 
 

A:  The sound, the soft three syllable sound.  And so I became Ruth Andrea Abel.   

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
48
 
 
 
 
Q: Did it have any national connotations for you? I mean was it definitely Œ 

 

A: No I was alwa ys, I alwa ys went by sound rather than rul e.  Later I l earned it meant 
something like gift of God or something. I™m not sure.  I™ll have to look that up again. 
And of course Rut h Andrea became Randy. That was my nickname for many years.  Now 

that I work at the Holocaust Museum, I feel Randy isn™t right, so I go as Ruth.   

 

Q: Where you 
named
 after anyone i n particular? 
 

A:  Well that™s the strange thing. My parents when the y were wait ing for me, apparently 
never had di scussions about names the wa y m y husband and I di d. And here™s my dear 
mother, recuperating from having had me in bed and m y dad hot foots it to city hall and 

says he wants me named Ruth. He had never even consulted  her.  She wanted to call me 

Ellen, but t hen she thought Ellen Abel doesn™t sound good so she hesitated.  So he comes 

back with a fait accom pli.  Here I was Ruth.  I didn™t like, she di dn™t l ike it.  But  there it 

was. 

 
Q: Do you know why he selected Ruth? 
 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
49
 
 
 
A: I wish I knew. It would be interesting, wouldn™t it? I haven™t a cl ue.  I don™t™ t hink he 
ever had a girlfriend named --- used to have many girlfriends before he got married. In 

fact he was married before.  And never mentioned Ruth.

Margaret Garrett:  This is a continuation of United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 

volunteer collection interview with Ruth Harvey, conducted by Margaret Garrett on 
August 22, 1997 i n Bet hesda, Maryl and.  Tape  number 2, side A.  During the break you 
were talking about your father™s first marriage. 

 

Ruth Harve y:  Yes. He had always been a st age door Johnny, a man about town. He really 

was.  He once had a violent love affair with a young actress named Helen Richter.  And 

he was so j ealous of her, he was all set to shoot her. He was a very passionate young man. 

Well he got  over that.  But he did marry an artist as his first wife. She was pri ma ballerina 
of the Berlin Opera. Her name was Elizabet h 
Grube
.  She was non-Jewish and she was a 
very good dancer. They were married about four years and then she ran off with a stage 
designer, a Greek stage designer.  (background crashing noise) and then he was a 

divorced man and I thi nk it was a very good t hing wh
en my mother
-
to
-be walked into hi s 
life.  As his secretary. 

 

Q: So he had no children from his first marriage. 
 
A: No. And she  later married some titled German and barely escaped with her l ife when 

the Russians overran the estate that the y lived on, barel y escaped.  She later died.  I met 

her once. She™s a very charming lady. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey

Q: Ok. Let™s go back to New York and you went to high school where? 

 

A: I went t o the high school of music and art which had alwa ys been a fund project of 
Ma yor LaGuardia, Fiorello LaGuardia.  And you could, and only go in there by passing 
certain tests.  And I™m happy to say I passed them. And t here were t wo categories in 

those da ys.  Now i t™s the high school for the performing art s, but i n those da ys it was just 

music and art.  I belonged with the artists.   

 

Q:  AndŠ  

 
A: It was a regular high school but the y were these two different things that we 
concentrated on, a career for music or a career as an artist, in addi tion to high school 

subjects. 

 

Q: So you graduated from high school in what  year? 

 

A: I think ma ybe 48. I was always one year behind 
because
 of m y having been a refugee. 
I believe I graduated in 48 if I™m not mist aken. 

 

Q: And then what happened? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
52
 
 
 
A: Well I went to Cooper Union for a ti me. I did not graduate from there. I was all , that™s 
another thing. You had to take an exam to get into that. I passed t hat for the day courses.  

And then m y parents took me aside and sai d R uthie, there just isn™t the mone y there. 

You™re just  going to have to take a da y ti me job, go to night school. Well I was very 
upset about  that. All my friends who were abl e to go to Cooper Union were going in the 
day time. And it was very hard for me to work at jobs, sales jobs. The worst job I ever 

had as a very young person, oh this was ghastl y was in some horrible neighborhood 

downtown where we spra y painted little monkey masks. You know the little faces on 

little monkeys.  We spray painted them.  Every ti me I sneezed I™d get  out a different 

rainbow color. It was unhealthy and unpleasant. It was I would say factory work. It was 

just ghastly. Well I did, the jobs I got in t hose days were not very good. And it was a 
great strain to work at t hat and then go to night school. And after a while I, I just  dropped 
out. And much to my regret, really.  And t hen I, eventually after many lesser and less 

enjoyable j obs, I found a lovely secretarial j ob with Paramount t heaters in the Paramount 

building in Ti mes Square where I stayed for four years and I really enjoyed it.  I was 

ordering candy for the t heater chains and doing secretarial.  Candy was bigger with them 

than the fil ms were.  They got more revenue from that. And I stayed with them.  Oh I 

must tell you how I got  the job at t he State Depart ment in Washington.  Would you like 
to 
hear
 how I got that? 
 
Q:  Were you in New York when you got the State Depart ment j ob? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
53
 
 
 
A: Yes. I™ll  tell you how. My parents went for a vacation t o Nassau and it was February 
and I was al one in the apart ment and feeling a little woebegone. Things were not going 

terribly smoothly in my life.  And late at night I had the radio on and I heard an 

announcer sa y woul d you like a career in the foreign servi ce?  If so, apply to the State 
Department at Center Street downt own and get  your form.  Well I took off from work the 
very next da y and took the subway all the wa y down to Center St reet, near Wall St reet, 

and applied for form 57, for empl oyment with the State Department i n quintupl icate.   

 

Q: Why were you i nterested in applying for the job? 

 

A: New York was not a healthy environment for me. I h
ad
 been there 16 years and I was 
not flourishing. Things were not happening well for me.  And I felt that I needed a 

change of life, life st yle, surroundings, everyt hing. 

 

Q: What was not happening that you want ed to? 

 

A: I met a l ot of people who I felt were rather neurotic. There was something unhealthy 

about life in New York, if you were not well cushioned by money. If you had 
to struggl e, 
it could be downright depressing at times. And I felt that I was young enough, that I owed 
it to m yself to go someplace else and try something new.   So the very next da y I got the 

form.  My parents were still on vacation.  Every night after work I would lie on the floor, 

on the carpet , on m y st omach and fill out some more of this huge, positively endless form 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
54
 
 
 
in quintuplicate. You had to go back to your very first beginnings of life.  Everybody you 
ever
 knew you had t o go get references and schools. It took a week to fill it out 
conscientiously.  I did t hat and I listed 
references
 here and t here and what not. And I 

mai l
ed it off and this was February.  And I forgot about i t. In Ma y I™m sitting 
in my 
office at the Paramount  theaters when the phone rang and it was Washington, offering me 

a job.  Well  m y father was so pleased because he had always had a high regard for 

diplomats. The diplomat™s life. And here was this little Ruthie entering, true at the very 

bottom. B ut still it was the State Depart ment. He couldn™t have been more pleased. So I 

gaveup my jobat Paramountand traveled to 
Washington. 

 

Q: Now you had been l iving still in your parents™ home. 
 
A: Well at first in their home and then I managed to get a room in the same building 

above them. But I left all that quite happily and settled in Mount Pleasant and worked for 

the State Department for about four years. 

 

Q: Did you know anyone in Washington? 

 
A: I had had a boyfriend who had lived in Washington on and off. He was a flight 
engineer. And I visited him once and the first t hing I saw from Union Station was the 

Capitol and trees everywhere I looked. I feel hook line 
and
 sinker. I fell in love with 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
55
 
 
 
Washington and I want ed to live here. So when the State Department job came, I thought  
this is wonderful. This is a wonderful way to get where I want to go. 

 

Q: So you came down by yourself and you found housi ng. 
 
A: Yes. My father treat ed me to my first night ™s hotel room and then at the State 

Department I went t o the registry for housing and the y found me a pl easant place on 

Mount Pleasant. Yes, it was nice.  A group home with lots of other young women.   

 

Q: And that job worked out pretty well for you. 

 
A: Oh indeed, I had a wonder, I loved working for (                )The odd thing is I went as 
a, I wanted t o go as a foreign secretary.  And they offered me such a hideous assignment 

that I simply switched to domestic because I thought I™d be happier than oh what was this 

country. It was land locked.  And I can™t think of the name right now.  But it was the least 

appealing country i n Latin America. No ocean, no nothi ng. And  I thought to m yself to, 

to lose two years of m y life in this boon docks. That didn™t seem right. And so I si mply 

and in those da ys you can get a second choi ce.  And so I switched to domestic and I 
worked in t he Latin American division  with m y previous knowledge of Spanish. And I 
had a very good time as a single girl in Washi ngton. I enj oyed myself. And then 
I met m y 

husband to be.  And that starts another chapter in my life.   

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
56
 
 
 
Q: And how did you meet him? 
 

A:  Very romantic. In those days the Park Sheraton hotel had a magnificent Olympic 

sized pool. Now it™s been paved over as a parking lot. Can you imagi ne.  IN those da ys it 
was a very refreshing beautiful blue green. Water. And one Labor Day, i t was Labor Da y 
1957. It was very hot, m y girlfriend and I decided to go to that pool for a nice swi m.  And 

so we went and that™s how I met m y husband.  Sitting next to me. 

 

Q: What was he doing? 

 

A:  Well this is so strange. He was also , he said he was also in the foreign service. And 
what he couldn™t™ tell me in those da ys, but I can tell now because h e™s been dead since 
1972, he was with the CIA. I mean he didn™t™ tell me that of course. He just, we 

exchanged telephone numbers and he said if you call me and I™m not there, just leave a 

message cause that™s the wa y it is.  I didn™t know that so he called me and missed me so I 

called hi m and he wasn™t there and I wasn™t going to leave a message so I just hung up. 

This wa y we never would have gotten together. But finally he got me at home because I  

had only given hi m m y office number. My boss took pity on hi m and he said I™ll give you 
her home phone number, god bless him.  And t hen we saw each other every day for about 
nine mont hs and t hen he was assigned to Athens, Greece. And that ™s when he asked me 

to share his life there with him, And we got married and we went t o Athens.  And live 

happily there for five years. And two of m y three children were born there. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
57
 
 
 
 
Q: Now when did you l earn he was with the CIA? 

 

A: He told me after much hemming and hawing months and months l ater.  He had too 
because I was Œ 
 

Q: 
Before yougot married?
 

 

A: No let me see.  No I was aware of what he was doing before we talked marriage yes. 

 

Q: So before you talked marriage. 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: You knew that he was with the CIA.  Was he Jewish? 
 

A: Oh no. He was, he came from Milwaukee of Polish and 
Welsh
 stock. The Welsh or 
English part woul d have been Protestant, but I, Unitarian.  And the ot her part was Polish 
Catholic. His mot her was Catholic. She came from Polish peasants, maybe third 
generation and his father was first generation. The y came over from England and went 

into real est ate in Milwaukee. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
58
 
 
 
Q: And what religi on was he? 
 

A: Well like his, li ke his, well he was not Catholic like his mother. He was like his father. 

Could you stop it  for a mi nute. I™m trying to. 
 
Q: Will you sa y that again. The tape didn™t start when you spoke so would you just repeat 

that?  

 

A: Yes, I had said Unit arian but I misspoke.  He was Congregati onal ist. In fact our three 

children were baptized at Plymouth Church in Milwaukee on different home leaves when 

we came back to visit his folks. And he had them christened right there. 
 
Q: Did you consider yourself at that point Jewi sh, not Jewish. 

 

A: This is the story of m y life. I™ve never figured out 
exact ly
 what   I am. I certainly feel 
more Jewish than anyt hing else.  And yet , I am not really a practicing Jew. I don™t follow 

the high holida ys or the customs 
because
 I was raised so differently. And so that is sort  of 
a, a conflict within me as to what exactly where do I belong. 
 
Q: So your children were christened in the Congregational  church. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
59
 
 
 
A: Yes, and the y™re ful ly aware that my background is Jewish, t hat some of their blood is 
Jewish and the y know all this and the y are simply, all three of them. I have tried to get 

them to go to Sunda y school or have given them bibles, and the y™re just. They™re 

wonderful. They™ve got good characters but they™re non-rel igious totally. I couldn™t get 
anywhere with them. 
 

Q: Whydid youtry to get 
them to go to Sunday school? 
 

A: Because we were in the foreign service overseas. There was a lot of people going to 

church. It was a social t hing for the people to get together.  Their children went to Sunda y 

school. And I thought it would be kind of good for them t o learn t he stories of the bible
.  
You know. But I couldn™t get them. The y didn™t want to.  
 

Q:  In your home, did you celebrate Christ mas? 

 

A: Christ mas, Easter, Thanksgiving. And birthdays. That was about it .  

 

Q: You were in Athens with your husband for five years. 
 
A: Yes five years. 

 

Q: You had two children there? 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
60
 
 
 
 
A: Well two were born there, yes. The third was born in Fairfax hospital later.  

 

Q: How do you think having been a refugee and that entire experience, how do you think 
that affected your life when you went back overseas t
o Athens?
 
 
A: This is interesti ng that you should ask this because the Greeks, delving back into 

history have alwa ys been known t o honor the stranger, to give hospit ality to the stranger, 

to the visitor.  
Xeno s
, t he stranger. They couldn™t have been more hospitable or 
welcoming. It™s in their blood.  And I compared that to the German character of 

mistrusting instinctivel y t he foreign element.  The Aryan. Right awa y. And I thought to 
m yself what a shame that people have to be so different. 
 

Q: So the Greeks 
were hospitable?
 
 

A: Oh yes.  

 

Q: How about other people in the foreign service and in t he CIA? 
 
A:  Well those were the da ys when there was a very ideali stic bunch of people there like 

m y husband and his friends, very good sort of people. And to patriots, and risking their 

lives and we have a very high opi nion of the people we worked wi th.  In fact, I didn™t

realize. You know i n those days I didn™t™ think about liberal or conservative, Democrat or 
Republican.  In those days in the 50s there were so many moderat es on both si des and 

they sort of melded. It wasn™t really until the 80s and 90s that you see this really ugly 

tooth and nail attitude between the Democrats  and the Republicans, the ultra 
conservatives and liberal has become a dirty word. This is something that didn™t exist 

then. 

 

Q: Did you feel there was any di scri mination about you being Jewish? 

 

A: I just say no.  No.   

 
Q: So you were in Athens for Œ 
 

A: However excuse me for interrupting. Had t here been anything l ike that, I would not 

have hidden. I would have spoken out but  I was fortunate in that, that never came up. 

 

Q: Do you think that™s because of your previous experience that you would have been 

more likely to speak up? 
 
A: Oh definitely, of course.  Yes. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
62
 
 
 
Q: What about havi ng children? Was that for you do you think a different experience 
because of your previous life in Germany andŠ 

 

A: I would not wed these two ideas together. It was something entirely different. A 
totally different trip. Had nothing to do with religion.  Or, or past or anything.  It was 
something new, a new world I was going into. 

 

Q: And so that wasŠ 

 

A: The best  thing I ever did or went through and gave meaning to m y life. I mean this is 

what I had been born for and raisi ng theŠand then later when m y husband died, fairl y 
early.  We had only been married 14 years, and left, leaving me with three children and 
their ages were at the ti me, 11, ten and eight.  And fortunately the government provided 

pensions and we di dn™t™ suffer hardship, but st ill I was the one to raise these three and 

ma y, this i s interesting. Ma ybe m y past experi ences in deal ing wit h hardships gave me 

the strength to endure t his terrible shock of losing him so young and being in charge of 

three young lives.  And I must say the y had such good character. It was so easy to raise 

them. I thoroughly enjoyed being a parent  and I must sa y the y didn™t give me much grief 
at all. The y were good kids. I raised them instinctually.  All of us do and there™s no 
handbook for being a parent. And i t came out well.   

 

Q: You have boys and Œ 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
63
 
 
 
 
A: I have two boys and the girl is in the middl e.  Well of course the y are men and a 

young woman.  Jenny j ust went, moved to Brooklyn to follow her man who got a job 

there and she is a cli nical social worker. She just got her masters l ast year, a year ago.  
And Michael is an honors, the oldest boy is an honors professor in Milwaukee at 
University of Wisconsin. 

 

Q: What is his field? 

 

A: He™s teaching an honors course which will be up next year and then he has to struggl e 

to get another job.  It™s not easy. 
 
Q: An honors course would cover a number of different subjects? 

 

A: Yes.  Arts, poli tics and those things are only for three years so when that™s over and 

with the present problem with teaching and professors not having tenure, he™ll be lucky if 

he gets anot her teaching position, although he™s very, the student s love him. And my 

youngest is worki ng here in Washi ngton. He™s got a nice j ob, just  got married recently 
and nice young couple, very happy with life. So I can  gratefully say t hat I would sa y the 
most creati ve thing and the most construct ive t hing in m y life would be raising these 

three children.  Havi ng gotten them in the first place born healthy and I™m very, very 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
64
 
 
 
grateful about that.  And that™s what helped me through m y widowhood, having them to 
take care of.  

 

Q: Did you work after your husband died? 
 
A:  Yes. I remember that I had worked at, had a little part t i me job at an insurance 

company when Johnny was still working for the agency here and then he left and a mont h 

after he left, I got the death notice and struggl ed for a little bit longer at that job.  And 

then the y replaced me with somebody who had been there before and like a homing 

pigeon I fled to the agency that he worked for and told them my story and the y gave me a 
part time job which I kept for eight years whil e raising the children. I couldn™t take a full 
time job. I had a part time job. I was home when the y came home from school. And then 
I switched t o full ti me for a few more years when the y were bigger and then I took early 

retirement. Now I™m retired and it™s amazing how full one™s da ys can be, although 

retired. 

 

Q:  And so have your friends been some refugees, not refugees? 

 
A: Well there™s still  Vera, although she™s far away and I™ve had friends from all over.  
Refugees and native Americans and Cubans and oh yes,  I just t ake people as 
the y come. 

I don™t have groups. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
65
 
 
 
Q: So you haven™t felt l imited to having other refugees who have had similar 
experiences?  

 

A: That is a feeling I had in New York when I was a teenager, about 13 or so and those 
days all the poor frightened sick people who had survived Nazi Germany had all come to 
Manhattan and all settled on the west side. And it was, I  remember how terribly 

depressive it was as a young teenager to see these poor ol d pale gra y shadows of 

themselves walking around Broadwa y, each one a tragic story. There were so many of 

them. I remember the feeling I had at the time, how tragic this was and how I wanted to 

get awa y from it. 

 
Q: So that was part  of 
your
 wanting to come t o Washingt on.  
 
A: Well by the ti meŠ yes, you know by t he time that I was ready to l eave, those people 
were still there.  Oddly enough, many, many 
decades later
 I went back. They were all 
gone and their offsprings doing well and the places had been, bad neighborhoods had 

been made wonderful. AndNew Yorkwastotall y different,
 a completel y different stage 

set. All those poor, poor shadows had vanished.  And you saw nice young people joggi ng 
along, healt hy and i t was just, just like it was when I went to Germany. I said this is a 
brand new country. New York was a brand new country decades after I left it. But at the 

time when we were all refugees there together, I found it very, very sad. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
66
 
 
 
Q: But when you came to Washington, you did not have that feeling of refugees together. 
 

A: No, in fact you know in New York thi s had this unhappy reputati on for not being 

terribly polite or.  Well I thought anyone i n Washington seemed so healthy and so 
pleasant and I really enjoy the people here. I li ke it better. I must admit I had got ten fed 
up with New York. And consider this place a place to get m y healt h back and I did. 

 

Q: You went back t o Germany when?  

 

A: With m y, oh after I became widowed in 72, m y mother and I managed to plan to go 

back to Germany.  I think it was 76 or 78. I don™t remember which. And the sad t hing 
about m y husband is he died in Viet Nam and when he left here, we had decided t hat 
when he had finished his tour whi ch was supposed to be 18 months, we would meet in 

Germany and I would show it to hi m.  He was going to come strai ght from Viet Nam. I 

was going to come straight from Washington.  We were going to meet there and I was, I 

told him we were going to paint t he town red. And I was so looking forward to t hat. 

 

Q: He was in Viet Nam with the C IA? 
 
A:  Yes. 

 

Q: And how did he die? 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
67
 
 
 
 
A:  Well there are several versions which I don™t know t hat I want to go into. One is that 

he died in a swi mming pool and the other one™s a different version that somebody got to 

hi m from North Korea and so not knowing the full truth it™s best not to. I don™t™ know.  
I™ll never know the truth so I can™t really tell you.  But anyway the idea being that when 
he had finished his tour, we were going to reunite and I was going to show hi m m y home 

town. So you can i magine the state of mind I was in when I went  years later with my 

mother.  I remember being very unhappy and very unpleasant and very crabby and I 

apologized to her.  I said Mutti, I™m sorry, but I™m just so sad. I pictured this so 

differentl y. And she said apologies are not necessary my dear. I fully understand. But 

then after I had gotten t here and discovered t hat it was, everything was so different from 
what I remembered and people were pleasant. And this was before the return of the 
skinheads. At this point , I thought oh my this i s marvelous.  The new Germans are great. 

This is a democrac y. How nice. And it was onl y l ater when I was back home a few years 

later and I read about  these outrages against t he Turkish laborers and the skinheads you 

know setti ng houses on fire. And just being generally nasty to the alien labor forces that 

they had. And skinheads with swastikas and what not and I got so fed up and so disgusted 

you know.  So as you can see, I™ve always had a roller coaster feeling about Germany. 
It™ll alwa ys be with me. My daughter said maybe you should see a therapist and I don™t 
know.  I just don™t  know. Should I or shouldn™t I, I don™t, she thi nks I should.   

 

Q:  Let™s tal k about  your experience with t he Holocaust museum. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
68
 
 
 
 
A: Yes. It™s funny. People had alwa ys told me through 
the years, Randy
 why don™t you 
be a docent, ma ybe at t he Smithsonian or something. And I™d say yeah, yeah.  I didn™t™ 

really want to. I had no desire to.  I think Œ  
 
Q: Think t hat you needed an interest or you had too much ti me. 

 

A: Yeah, something besides I™m garrulous and I like people. The y thought it™d be terrific. 

And I said nothing tugged at me. And then I read an article in the Washington Post about 

the new hol ocaust museum. And the idea t hat I adored, in those da ys the y still had those 

pass machi nes when you would take a one of those ID book, cards or pamphlets from the 
machine and you woul d read you know peopl e who had been through the Holocaust and 
you™d read t heir story. And in those da ys you would have to go to a different floor and 
get the second page and you coul dn™t just read the whole thing. As you went from floor to 

floor the fate of this person unfolded. The y got rid of those machines because the y were 

used to deat h, the y died. The y got  rid of them.  They were always breaking down.  Now 

you get the whole little passbook and unless you control yourself and wait you can read 

the whole t hing while waiting for the elevator.  The idea being that you didn™t know then 
would this person make it or woul d they perish. And that was rat her dramatic.  I thought 
the idea was phenomenal 
you
 know. And then I read that the y were looking for 
volunteers and all of a sudden it was like bong.  All of a sudden, I was interested. My 

heart was in this. This i s something that I felt I could do so well with my background. 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
69
 
 
 
And so I wrote a letter and the y replied. And I came for an interview and I was accepted. 
I was thrilled. I loved t he museum. I love what they™re doing  and I enjoyed being a 

volunteer and were it not for m y bad ankle and knee, I would be here much more often 

than I a m. But fortunat ely the y have an opening for me here in the oral history 
department and I™m very happy translating and shaking through t hese documents. 
 
Q: You sai d that you love the museum and what the y™re doing.  What is it that you love 

about the museum? 

 

A: It™s a learning museum. It teaches peopl e, often, young peopl e who otherwise might 

be totally unaware of the Holocaust that there was such a thing and t hat those flakes who 
keep proclai ming that i t never happened are fl akes. And that this real ly did happen. 
There™s enough evidence in this museum to show that.  I l ove that .  That somebody took 

the trouble to build it and, and I love the architect who went to the camps and got the 

ideas for the architect ure directly from the camps.  James Engle Freed. And I l ove what 

he did.  It™s a magnificent building.  And going, the strange is when I applied, I said 

please don™t put me near scenes of horror. I don™t™ want to see it. And put me anywhere. 

Well sure enough, t he y did just t he opposite. And I found m yself walking through the 
permanent exhibit.  But  I learned to live with it. 
 

Q: What was your first assignment  there? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
70
 
 
 
A: To walk, to be a wal ker through the different floors of the permanent exhibit. Make 
sure everything was going along well.  You know as you come out of the elevator you see 

a horrible thing on the fourth floor, against the wall and al l the corpses of, I mean this is 

what I had tried to avoi d.  And som
ehow the y got meint othat.
 
 

Q: Did you ever ask to be transferred? 

 

A: No once I was t here, I decided that having seen it once, I could live with it and do the 

job that they wanted me to do. And of course 
t here™s many others. Youdon™t, you™renot 

constantly walking through the permanent exhibits. Many other areas. So I do it. And 

unfortunately because of my bad foot now, I don™t go as often. I intend to go perhaps 
once a month on a weekend when they need people. Keep m y foot in so to speak, but 
concentrat
e moreon oral 
histories and transcriptions.  
 

Q: You said that when you read about the need for volunteers somet hing Œ  

 

A: Oh m y heart just jumped.  I sai d to m yself god if anybody can show the publi c, it™s me 

and I think every one of those volunteers must  have had that same zing when the y read 
about this, don™t you think? 
 

Q:  
Can you
 say more about that feeling that you would be able t o show the public Œ 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
71
 
 
 
A: I had a feeling that m y life, remember now that I was a middle aged retired woman 
without a husband in her life, children grown up, life a little empty. And all of a sudden 

here is something t hat t otally engaged me, m y mind and m y heart and I said this is what  I 

was put here for. I was taking, I was in the skil led complex because I didn™t™ suffer as 
much as the others.  I said this is maybe how I can atone for that. I can tell peopl e what 
these people went through and where the y ended up and, and I can be more dramatic 

perhaps than somebody who wasn™t as close to the subject, you know. And I, I had a 

f
eelingthatthis museum gave more meaningt o m ylife.
 
 

Q: We have to turn over the tape. 

 
Q: When we stopped you were talking about your work at  the museum giving meaning to 
your life. Can you say more about that? 

 

A: Oh yes, yes. Fi rst of all when I was an only child and shy I di dn™t™ know that I really 

loved peopl e. But as I  got more mature and more worldly I discovered that I really liked 

people very much and it™s wonderful working with the public. You meet so ma
ny 

different people, different outlooks on life.  I™m able to use my two foreign languages on 
them. When I speak Spanish to some people, bewildered 
family
 from Argentina, t heir 
faces just light up and I can conve y to them the things they want to know about the 
museum and when Germans come to visit, and this is a strange t hing. I™ve seen young 

German people come i n and the y have the strangest expressions on t heir faces.  Ma ybe I 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
72
 
 
 
read more into it because of my background, but ma ybe not.  There is a mixture, sort of 
fear and shame and more. It™s a combination of impressions, when I look at the young 

faces. They know what their country has done and I™m sure the y feel t errible about  it.  

And the y feel embarrassed and gui lty but eager to see this and afraid to see it. It™s a 
fascinating expressi on. I™ve seen it at various times.  And I try to put them at ease. I mean 
they didn™t cause this. 

 

Q: How do you do that ? 

 

A: I speak their language to them.  And l ook at them kindly.  I am gentle with them. But I 

say how happy I am that the y are here. Then I emphasize but you of all people 
you
 have 
to know this and that™s all I sa y.  And the y nod. And I have a feeling I™m getting m y poi nt 

across. 

 

Q: Do you think any of the visitors  pick up that you were a refugee? 

 

A: Oh, thi s is interesting because one of those mi nute suggestion was, the minutes from 

the meeting of the survivors, that the survivors ought to have special badges sa ying 
survivor.  Some people want that. Others, m yself included, do not  thi nk it™s such a great 
idea. But whenever I think it™s appropriate to a particular group of people in a given 

situation, I™ll mention. There is one place, m y favorite in the whole museum and it™s a 

remember the children Daniel™s house. That is my favorite exhibit  because that is partly 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
73
 
 
 
m y youth growing up i n Germany. Many of the things in that exhibit it™s like walking 
through a series of stage sets. Remind me of my own childhood. Although it didn™t have 

the terrible ending t hat are pictured there like the ghetto and the camps. I left before them. 

But every often when I have a nice 
family
 who brought t heir chil dren, I™ll put t he 
emphasis on look at the children and the y™ll say t hat™s just like my chi ldhood was I grew 

up under those circumstances and t hen I sa y but I didn™t™ have the sad ending.  But I says 

basically remember my own childhood there and this, the children look at me wi th big 

eyes.  It™s very useful t o be able to do that convincingly because it ™s the truth you know.  

And I do t hat when I li ke a given group and I want to add to their knowledge. I don™t feel 

that I want t o go around with a badge that sa ys survivor though you know.  I don™t want 

to do that. Was anyt hing else on this subj ect that you wanted to know.  Oh m y interaction 
with people.  The sweetest little peasant woman from some East European country 
talking Yi ddish came. She had mi splaced some object, had lost somet hing that her 

grandmother had gi ven her and it had been found in the l ost and found and I got it for her 

and handed it to her. And she didn™t speak the language. She grabbed m y hand and kissed 

it and I thought that was the sweetest most touching thing. And I was smiling the rest of 

the da y. I™m embarrassed but also touched.  And you meet so many different people. 

Someti mes you see a lady middle aged, tot ally overcome.  It was l ike we would come out  
of the hall of remembrance and she was just st anding there and her shoulders were 
shaking. She was leani ng against the column, her face to the column and I just gently.  I 

know we™re not supposed to touch the public but someti mes a human touch is sort of 

instinctive and I just gently patted her shoulder and stood by her and she calmed down.  

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
74
 
 
 
You had the feeling that you are an ambassador between the museum and the public and, 
and you try to be a good influence and help and represent t he museum and all of that.  

Many other stories. 

 
Q: How has it been working with the other vol unteers? 
 

A: I met the nicest bunch. First I went on Wednesda y afternoons and then Larry asked if 

there were anybody here who would be willing to work on weekends because that™s when 

they really need help.  So I decided sure if that™s what™s wanted. And I work on 

Saturda ys, first in the afternoons and in the morning. Every second Saturda y.  And that 

worked out  very well. As I said everything was fine until I got my trouble with the knee 
and the ankle.   So I hope it will i mprove so I can do more.  But I found it very 
challenging and very nice. There™s 
alwa ys
 the odd pill in every crowd. There was one 
that was particularly odd but she™s no longer there I™m happy to sa y. And on the whole, I 

found them very pl easant.   Not everybody was pleasant but most of them are.   And 

some of them have stories to tell. Again which makes me feel guilty because I didn™t go 

through what the y went through.  It™s always t hat conflict. 
 
Q: You mean the other volunteers? 
 

A: The vol unteers, yes. 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
75
 
 
 
Q: Survivors had stories to tell. And how does that come up? 
 

A: Well I know that Nessy Golden for one, she™s legendary. When we had our trai ning 

she was the speaker. S he told us about when she was young child, when she was 15 and 
she was in on one of the worst camps and told of life in camp and, and you know ever 
since, whenever I see her, m y arms around her and hug her. And compared to her I feel 

guilty. It™s not m y fault  mi nd you. I know that. But the interesting thing is I discussed this 

with another volunteer and she looked at me.  She said you have the same feelings.    She 

said I thought I was the only one and I said oh thank god t here™s more and it™s a common 

feel
ing for those of us who had not had the utmost pain that the others did. 
 
Q:  Have you had more contact wit h survivors and other refugees through your work at 
the museum than you had before as far as opportunity to talk about Œ 

 

A:  Opport unity arise there which I didn™t have before.  Yes. 
 

Q: Has that  been helpful to you to have a chance to talk about some of these things? 

 
A: Absolutely. I mean i t™s™ fascinating.  There are some such dear people I look at  them 
and I listen to their past  as very young people in the camp and I say to myself, how can 

this man be so pleasant and so normal what he went through you know.   

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
76
 
 
 
Q: Are those things that you didn™t think about before or Œ 
 

A: Well those are things which I t hought about  before but had not been confronted with 

in the flesh. And you meet these people actually and you wonder about the human spirit, 
how much it can take and stay normal. 
 

Q: Overall would you say i t™s been more upset ting for you or it™s been more helpful to 

you to have  the volunt eer experience?  

 

A:  Oh it™s been heartwarming.  It has filled an empty place. I want ed to do something 

important, something necessary. I was feeling too comfortable here, a little isolat ed with 
not terribly much to do and I think that the, for the rest of my life, until I am no longer 
able to, I want to be involved with this museum. I just love it.  

 

Q: You started as a vol unteer?  

 

A: At the very begi nning when they were first  open, I was there before the y opened the y 

museum to the public t he da y before. There™s another little story. I went with m y very 
nice mature daughter Jenny. And we went  through the museum and she went you know 
where those boxes are where adult s look down at a series of clips below, pictures and 

film clips about the reall y horrendous thi ngs t hat the y don™t want kids to see. And that™s 

the experiments and beatings and that sort of thing. It™s kind of sad how many people are 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
77
 
 
 
alwa ys eager to look down at that.  Jenny came up to me and she said mom she said, 
don™t ever look at t hose. And I knew 
exactly
 what she meant because I™m the type if I see 
an ani mal being treated cruelly, I can™t get over it.   And you see some of these things it 

sears your soul. You can™t forget it. She di d me a big favor. And I™ve been working there 
since the beginning 
and
 I have never gone and looked at those things. Never. And she 
warned me. I™m very grateful to her.   Had I looked at that , I probably couldn™t continue 
working at the museum.  You would have to shield yourself against the utter horror. 

There™s limits to what you can take.  In fact I™m going to travel to eastern Europe in the 

late fall and on the way there will be a chance to go to the camps and I™m not goi ng to go. 

I don™t™ thi nk I could face it.  It™s enough that I go through the permanent exhibit. It™s not  

because I don™t™ care, but ma ybe because I care too much that I don™t want to go. 
 
Q: Now you are worki ng less wit h visit or services and you are spending some time doing  

translations Œ 

 

A: The purple folder is full of a document whi ch was on tape, a vi deotape in German. 

First I took it down wordy by word in German.  39 pages of it and now I™m translating it .  

From the German t o English.  Unfortunately I™m not ready yet for word processors and 
things like that.  I understand the museum might give courses on that. I™d like that. I™m 
doing it by hand. It would be lovely if I could just sort of tick it off like this. 

 

Q: So you do this in longhand? 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
78
 
 
 
 
A: Oh yes, that™s why it™s taking me a littl e longer. 

 

Q: Do you go down to the museum to do this? 
 
A: 
Wh en
 it™s done, I™ll go down.  In the meant ime I have a sufficient amount I™ll  mail it 
to Ms. Rubin.  Amy Rubin, I work for her. She™s a lovely girl and I want to have her 

know that in working on this, it™s taking quite a while. 

 

Q: I wanted to understand the process.  The museum lends you t he vi deo. 

 
A: I could do it all there in the library.  But I™ve chosen t o do it at home.  It makes no 
difference to me. 

 

Q:  So you put the video Œ 

 

A: I do the, I take t he i nformation from the vi deo at the li brary of course with their 

machines. And then when I have the document  I go home and I translate it.   
 
Q: I see. And what is t hat like for you? 

 

Interview with Ruth Harvey
 
79
 
 
 
A: Fascinat ing.  For instance, I™ll tel l you there is this wonderful video on.  It™s cal led 
ﬁWeapons of the Spirit ﬂ and it™s about the wonderful French Hug uenots mountain village 
of 
Le Chambon
  
and they™re legendary for their aid that t he y gave to Jewish refugees. 
The y™re famous for it.  In fact if you™d like me to lend 
you
 this, it™s wonderful.  It™s called 
ﬁWeapons of the Spirit ﬂ.  Ad it™s t his very stirring which I™ve alwa ys been so moved by 

that this particular translation is of a man who was a French Swi ss who worked at 
Le 

Chambon
 during the war, helping numerous children, carrying for t hem, nouri shing 

them, helping them escape.  And how the y vill age of 
Le Chambon
 worked with hi m.  

And it was a very famous priest.  Father 
Trocmé
, legendary and he™s mentioned in this 
manuscript. So I have been so thri lled to be working wit h this material because 
even
 
before I knew of the museum, I was touched by t he story of 
Le Chambon
 and how they 
helped the Jews there. The y were al l Huguenots, not Catholics.  It™s very thrilling 
mat erial.  First I did the story of his wife, and now I™m doing his story and it™s absolute
ly 

thrilling work. And it shows you the heroi sm t hat people are capable of. This is a 

particularly, this is not the story only of suffering and vict i mization but it™s what one man 

with good will can do to prevent horrors from happening and to get, he always 

emphasizes in this report that he didn™t do it by hi mself. He had the help of the village 

people and other pri ests and many others.  But he had this gift of networking which is a 
gift. And he used it to full advantage to save many lives.  And you can imagine how 
honored I am to be working with this story.

Q: You sai d some minutes ago that working with the museum i s heartwarming 
for you.  

Could you sa y how that Œ 

 
A: Ma ybe t hat™s the wrong phrase. I just have the feeling that it engages my heart, m y 
emotions. I™m fully committed to bring out the best that this museum has to offer and 

share it wit h the public. I have had no dealings with creating it or furnishing or anything 

but what I am able t o do as is be in between the museum and the public and convey to 

them some of what the museum is about. And I feel that I am uniquel y qualified to do 

that.  And that is satisfyi ng. 

 
Q: And what do you think is the best that the museum has to offer. What is it 
that you 
want to conve y? 

 

A: It teaches the world about the Holocaust.  That is its purpose.  And it™s, somet i mes I 

look through the book that visitors leave data on, their thoughts about it and it™s 

marvelous, wonderful whatthey 
have to say about it. You get the occasional oddball that  
says something horribl e, but fortunately the y are few and far between.  The maj ority of 
people are absolutely enthralled by it.  
 

Q: What ki nds of things do you remember people saying?

A: How wonderful for you to be here and show the worl d or this sort of thing must never 
happen agai n. And God couldn™t, ma y God prevent this from happening again. Thank 

you so much for showing the gratitude and astonishment and you know it™s marvelous. 

It™s just fascinating. I don™t know if people know that they can go up to the second floor 
and look through t hese books of what others say about it.  At the, you know at the end of 
the exhibiti on  that  crosses the Hall of Remembrance and then when you go through the 

little corridor there these big books that you can write in.  And it shows you that the 

public really does appreciate it.  

 

Q: Do you feel that your work is appreciated? 

 
A: Definitely. I™ve had numerous, we have one little gimmick that ™s very satisfyi ng. Each 
one of us receives every month, t en ticket s. Now you know the t icket s are free but you 

have to wait  in line for a long ti me. And it ™s very convenient to be handed a ticket.  Now 

I don™t always have ten family members or inti mat e friends that I give these ticket s to.  

So I keep them in m y purse and when I™m at t he museum. And when that hour finally 

arrives when there™s no more ticket s, and I see some desperate young visitor from a far 

off country, I™m so glad I could sl ip her ti cket  or hi m and oh, right after the Oklahoma 
bombing, I had the Att orne y General of Oklahoma.  He was in t he news just the other 
day. I forget his name right now. It™s 
Boswerson
 or something.  Very nice man. And he 

looked at me. I had no idea who he was. And he said oh what a shame.  He said I can™t 

get any ticket and I™m only here for a da y. And I said where are you from. He said

Oklahoma.  He said I™m t he attorney general. No, he didn™t™ sa y that then.  He j ust said he 
was from Oklahoma and I liked the wa y he looked. He seemed like a nice human being 

so I r
eached 
into m y pocket and I said here l et me give you this li ttle pass. I hate for you 
to be here for nothi ng. And he thanked me so much and dashed off.  Hours later he found 
me where I was collect ing tickets or something and said I want to thank you so much for 
making it possible for me to see. He said I™m the Attorne y General of Oklahoma and I 

said oh m y god, I said your poor state. I™m so sorry for what you had to go through. And 

it was just like instant friendship.  We never see each other again.  But  I don™t™ thi nk 

we™ll ever forget each other. And it™s that  sort of human story that is so enriching you 

know.  And many other instances t hat I can™t remember of a direct contact with another 

life, brief but you don™t ™ forget it.  I just said I can™t remember. But  you know what I 
mean. Different various instances remain i n my mind. 
 

Q: What else woul d you like to tal k about? 

 

A: Well I ok, let me say t hat I appreciate that the museum gives us folks a chance to 

voice our 
experiences
 from where we came from and where we are and how it felt and 
how it was.  This is a wonderful thing that you™re letting us do and it™s alwa ys ni ce to 
have a voice and to be counted and to be heard from and I appreciate that and I want to 
repeat that I really love the museum and I™m t erribly glad the y came to the city. And I 

think that™s all. Don™t you.
