Interview with Frederick Wohl 
February 13, 2004 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr 
collection. This is an interview with Fr
ederick Wohl, conducte
d by Margaret West, 
on February the 13
th
, 2004, in Bethesda, Maryland. Th
is interview is part of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum™s
 post-Holocaust interview project, and 
is a follow up interview to a USHMM vi
deotaped interview conducted with 
Frederick Wohl on Novemb er the 22
nd
, 1989. The United 
States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum gratefully acknowled
ges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this 
interview possible. This is tape numb er one, side A. 

Answer: Oh no, this is yours, isn™t it? 

Q: Yes. Mr. Wohl, I wonder if you™d first 
of all just tell me on tape, we™ll record, 
your -- your name and your
 place and date of birth. 
A: This is Fred Wohl, actually Freder
ick Richard Wohl. I was born on June 7
th
, 
1914 in Baden-Baden, Germany.  

Q: And I™m also interested in knowing y 
-- your name, Wohl, is that a -- a German 
name, a Jewish name? 

A: That™s a -- a -- it -- it™s an o-original. 
My family, far as I know, never changed 
their last name, and I know my  grandfather 
-- really my great-grandfather supposed 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
3
to have come from Hungary, but I don™t know
 enough about that, on
ly that they told 
my father that he™s coming from Hungaria
n horse thieves, that™s about all. My 
grandmother came from Poland. My -- that™s 
on my father™s side
. On my mother™s 
side, her grandfather, I think, 
had a flour mill in the Germ
an state o f Hesse, an d they 
were pretty well off. My grandmother beca
me a widow before I was born, and sh e -
- a -- a -- her brother-in-law, Joseph Berlin
er, took care of her affairs in various 
ways. And I remember him as a v ery, ve
ry stern man, who however, when it was 
needed, came through. My parents were ma
r r ied in 1908, and with the dowry that 
my  mo ther got, my  father bought the pharmacy in Baden-Baden. This was a Grand 

Duke™s court pharmacy and one of the requi
rements was that the owner would visit 

the castle every year, in high ha
t and o-outfit, just as a co urtesy, leave his card there, 
and to continue to be the pharmacist of 
the court. That even continued after the 
German revolution, as long as th
e Grand Duchess Louise was alive. 
Q: So it ha -- it was a b u siness with a great history to it. 

A: Yeah. The pharmacy 
building was from t h e 15
th
 century, and is still unchanged, 
mostly, from the outside at l
east.  Although when 
my father decided to get central 
heating, they  dug up unde
rn eath the store and found 
buckets of Roman coins and 
Roman cups and things, which he gave to
 the mu seum in Baden-Baden. He had 

kept one -- one glass, but that™s -- was lo
st in the -- naturally
, during the -- in the 
war. His name is no longer at the mu seum in Baden-Baden.

Q: What was your father™s full name and his date of birth?  
A: His name is Julius Wohl, and his birth 
was the eighth of June, what™s the -- must 
have been ™89? Someth
ing like that, I™m not -- 
Q: A-And your mo ther™s full name? 

A: My mother™s full name was Gisela Littm
an, and she was nine years younger than 
my father. Her birthday was August 24
th
.  
Q: And -- 

A: I think my father™s was ™81, and he
rs was ™89. 1881 and 1889, something like 
that. 

Q: Mm-hm. And you were one of 
three children, two sisters -- 
A: [indecipherable] actually, 
my mother had five childre
n and three survived. When 
-- that was a time when babies didn™t have t
oo much a chance of 
su rviving. Even so, 
she had her children at a hospital in Baden-
Baden. He -- ma -- she first had a son, 
who did not survive, and th en after my  yo
ungest sister, she had another baby girl 
that was born dead, something like that. 
Q: And what was the -- what were the name
s of your two sister s, and what was the 
birth order? 
A: My older sister Ilsa, who became Mr
s. Ilsa Burns was born f -- second of 
September, 1915, and Margaret was born 
th e second of September -- no, she was 
1915, Ilsa was 1912, the older one. A
nd none of them are alive any mo re. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
5
Q: So you were the baby? 
A: No, I was in between. 
Q: Ah, so -- ah, 1914, of course, of course. 

A: Yeah, yeah. And Ilsa died on the isla
nd of Majorca. She had cancer, never told 

us, but she had been smoking and drinking 
all her life. Not excessive drinking, but 
years ago, quite a bit. Her favorite was Ut
a, a-and she died. I don™t reme mb er the 
years of either one. Margaret got sick a
nd she had to have a brain surgery, which 
she had in  New Jersey, where she owned 
a little house, and unfortunately she never 
recovered properly an d my  da
ughters looked after her a
nd took her to a place in 
Arizona, where they bo
th lived. And she -- she died ther
e. She died about five years 
ago, I would say. So  I say, 
I™m -- I™m no good on these da
tes, but I remember that it 
happened , and that was pretty sad, but sh
e didn™t realize that, she was at a point 
where she was happy with her 
life. Even so , she wasn™t a
ll there. That™s the family. 
And my first wife, Lillian Eisenberg, wa
s born in March six. She was six years 
younger than I am, that must have been 
™20 - 1920. And we had tw o daughters. We 
had a good marriage, but then she got sick 
and she had to be on 
dialysis for two and 
a half years, after which she -- she died 
here in -- in Washington. And I was alone 
for a little while, then I got 
married to Evelyn Mitzner, on June 26, 11 years ago. 
We had known  Evelyn and Ernie Mitzne
r for many years, and Ernie was a good 
friend of -- to me, and he died 
from -- what™s it? Sugar. The -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
6
Q: Oh, diabetes? 
A: Diabetes. The -- he was an amazing guy. He first lost one leg, then he wa -- lost 
another leg, and then  he lost a couple of fi
ngers, and finally he ha -- his heart give 
up. But he enjoyed life in spite of hi
s disability. They had a nice house in 
Annapolis, and we went toge
th er on weekends. They  had a weekend home in West 
Virginia, and we went on vaca
tions togeth er. And so, after a year and a few months 
of being alone, I married Evelyn and so ld 
my  house. And we are pretty happy to -- 

happy together, but in April 2003, she ha
d unexpected bleeding 
in  her brain, and 
she -- she had blain sur -- brain surgery, 
and she -- fortunately -- she is still in 

recovery actually, but she 
is doing br -- amazingly well, which makes me quite 

happy. One month after that, for no reason 
whatsoever, I got sick. In May, 2003. 
And at the Suburban Hosp ital 
they operated my -- my -- what is it? My belludder -- 
underbelly. I -- they told me afterwards it 
ma y have had to do with a hernia that I 
had been operated on 
about 40 years earl ie
r. And they put things in order, but after 
they had closed me up, they had to open
 me up ag ain to make sure everything was 
work ing. And th is separ -- second opening da
maged my  heart. So I was pretty sick 
since May of 2003. I was then in and out 
of hospital and recovery  places, and I™m 
now home with my wife, but we had to decide that this home is too big and too 

difficult to keep for us, and 
in th e next two months, we™ll be moving to the hired

residence on Connecticut Avenue, where 
we have a two bedroom and tw o bath 
apartment. And that™s it. 
Q: Well, I™d like to go b
ack to the beginning. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And -- and have you tell 
me more about your childho
od in  Baden-Baden. What 
do you rememb er about your
 extended family then? 
A: Well, my -- my father and my mother 
were prominen t citizens of Baden-Baden. 
He was naturally the owner of the [German]
 which is not a drugs
tore like here, it™s a 
pharmacy. A-And he was a honorary co
mmander of the first [indecipherable] 
organization. He was also memb er of the demo cratic party, and my  mo ther liked to 

be the society woman. She -- 
they -- they went 
to theater and concerts regularly and 
especially as long as we lived in the city
, she had tea hours after lunch with friends 
from the theater or from the concert. Pe
ople like the general director of the 
orchestra would come and have
 a cup of coffee and acto
rs with whom my mother 
got friendly. Let™s see, one
 who would be prominent be
came Mrs. d ™Albert, the 
composer d™Albert. She was his last of 
six or seven wives and he was a man who 
for each of his wives wrote an opera. A
nd she was -- Hilda d™Albert was stubborn. 
She wouldn™t get divorced, so there was 
no opera after the one he had written for 
her. And he died wa -- when I went to -- back to Germany the first time, d™Albert 
was -- she was living in  a pensio nne and I 
tried to see her, but without result. She

had a head ache. So it was quite a shock fo
r my parents when th
e Nazis came. T h ey 
were not known as Jews, b
ecause only my father had a little bit of religion, my 
mother didn™t. And we children, we had a fr
au -- fräulein, and whenever the fräulein 
changed, they took us to th
eir church, wa -- if they went
 to church Sundays, and in 
general we had no -- no relig
ion. And only after the Nazi were her -- Nazis were 
here, I became definitely aware of what I wa
s, and that both -- bo
th my parents were 
Jewish, and I was trying to find a -- I had 
a membership card fro
m the Jewish sports 
club, but I couldn™t find it. I™m slow, but 
what can you do? Have to th ink. No w, 
what next? 
Q: Did you have any ex tended family that
 were cl-close to you in Baden-Baden? 
A: There was my father™s brot
her lived there. He was a -- in a bank. And afterwards 

he was in the -- in a factory of [indeciphe
rable] after works -- I worked. He was -- 
had an  interesting story because when 
the Nazis took the Jews from Baden-Baden 
and brought them to south of France to
 a camp, I don™t rememb er the name, but 
then towards the end of the war, he was pa
ck ed on a train to ge
t to the -- to the 
ovens. And he got sick on the train and they
 threw him off in Avignon, in France, 

where he, who had never le
arned two wo rd s of a foreign language, he acquired 
some French and worked there -- and Eng
lish, I guess too -- worked there with the 

American -- the authorities who came up th
e Rhone Valley and eventually he made 
his way back to Baden-Baden, where they 
-- he became police chief and had a -- I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
9
think for 10 years he was that, and then 
he retired and everybody was happy with  
their Jewish police chief. But he had never be
en married before, so then he first got 
married to a lady who had a nice apartmen
t, which was one of the attractions, but 
after they were married, the 
authorities came and said this
 apartment is too big for 
you, you have to divide it up. Do  you want 
to keep the part with
 the kitchen, or the 
part with the bathroom? She selected the pa
rt with the kitchen, because there was a 
hotel nearby where my uncle was friendl
y with the owner, and wh ere they could 
always go to take a bath. That lady died
, and he remarried, a 
woman whom he had 
met a few years earlier on his vacations. He
 had the nice custom of going on a 
vacation alone. And he told us afterwards, 
yes, it was c a -- she was a nurse. He met 
her in -- on vacation, a la -- a woman with
 -- from Vienna who had three daughters, 
and I met her in Baden-Baden ju st before
 my  uncle died  and I visited her once 
afterwards, but I don™t know whether she is
 still alive. She had 
a big disappointment 
because there™s a regulation that younger
 women who marry an
 older person could 
not inherit his pension. They  wo uld have to
 be -- have been married for at least 10 
years and they were not. My 
cousin, who lives in Essen, Germany, tried to help her 
but there was no -- no way. Sh e had a nerv
ous breakdown, but then it seems her 

daughters could take care of her. And I 
no -- not in touch with any of them. 
Q: If I go back to your childhood, you woul
d, as a boy, not think of yourself as 
Jewish at all, is that right? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
10
A: No, that™s right. We didn™t now it. My
 sisters didn™t know it, and it came as a 
surprise. 
Q: Mm-hm. Would there be any way in wh ich you would observe Jewish holiday s 

or any religious services at all? 

A: No, my  -- my  father would go once a y
ear to synagogue, and I don™t rememb er 
whether I ever went with him. My first re
collection actually of a Jewish services 
was when  I lived on Cyprus and that was 
pretty late. But I made up for it to some 
extent by learning things, studying a little 
bit. When I -- when -- after I had lost my 
job in Germany, and stayed with my  parent
s in Frankfurt for a few weeks, there was 
a man who was traveling around [indeci
pherable] a-around Germany collecting 
money fo r a rabbinical school he wanted to
 start in Lichtenst -- Lichtenstein. He 
was probably a crook, but was very interes
ting man. He traveled with a companion. 
He sa -- he said he was his cousin. An
d he got sick and I visited him in his 
pensionne -- hotel where I was -- I lived. And 
that is where I recall first to get the 
first impression of the Jewish religion. He 
taught me that in contrast to all other 
religions, Jews can talk directly
 to their God, and that the ba
sis is -- of their religion 
really, 10 commandments. And I™ve never for
gotten it, I should have -- I should be 
gr-grateful to him. [indecipherable] 

Q: How -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
11
A: He left the country just before the Nazi
s tried to catch him, and a -- I -- I wished 
I had his name or anything, but I wa
s never in touch with him again. 
Q: How old were you when  your life bega
n to change as a result of the Nazis 
gaining power? 
A: 19 -- I was 20, ™14 [indecipherable] Nazi
s came. I was working 
the industry of -- 
in the office of [indecipherable], a compan
y that made bicycle lamp s and hydraulic 
lifts for automobiles, and electric switches,
 hot switches. I started working th ere in 
™32. ™32 was a year of 
change for me anyhow --

Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Muse
um interview with Fr
ederick Wohl. This 
is tape number one, side B. And we™ll continue. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You were telling me about the time when
 your life changed as the Nazis gained 
power. 
A: Right. So -- 
Q: That apprenticeship you were doing in  
1932, would th at have
 been regarded by 
your parents as a comp romise? Would th
ey  have wanted you to have been a 
pharmacist? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
12
A: No, no. But that™s the on
ly thing I could get. You s
ee, I -- as I say, I go -- I 
matriculate -- I got the [indecipherable] in 
30 -- March ™32. I left the same day for 
Switzerland, where we had an exchange 
program [indecipherable] family, and we 
were due a few more weeks. So I stayed
 in Nyon, at town on th e lake o-of 
[indecipherable] of Lake Leman, and went
 around the neighbor
hood on bicycle with 
a friend who was a son of that family. We
 went, for example, through Geneva and 

listened to a session of the League of 
Nations Council, which for us was very 
interesting to wa -- to see these people in
 the -- some [in d ecipherable] there was a 
[indecipherable] the British prime mini
ster, and Von Bulow was the German 
representative. And from France, I think it 
was Brionne, but I™m 
not sure. They had 
caricatures at that time, all over Geneva wi
th the -- the caricatures of Chamberlain, 
Brionne and Straserman, who was a German  
foreign minister. I met in Geneva also, 
some acquaintances of my  parents, just by 
chan ce, and to ld them that I had to go 
back to Germany soon, but I had no job and 
if there™s anything they could think of 
to help me. So when
 my time was over with the Prin 
[indecipherable] P-r-i-n, I went 
by train back to Basel, where we also ha
d friends, and there two boys and I, we did 
a bit of roaming around the mo untains in 
Switzerland. Then just one day befo re I 
would have to come -- go back to  Germa
ny, I got an phone call that there was a 
farm in -- n o rth of Revai on the Lake of 
Geneva, and the owner was ready to take 
me on as apprentice as -- to learn  about farm
ing, if I was interested . I exchanged my 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
13
ticket, instead of goin g north , I went back 
so uth to the lake and that man™s son f -- 
received me in Revai. The place where I spe
nd, must have been 
about four months 
is a -- was call -- the farm was called Ea
u de ville and ever
ybody spoke French, 
which was naturally the purpose, I shou
ld learn French. And it was at times 
difficult, but I had, in the early mornin
g, to go and clean the pig sty. I had 
afterwards to clean the cow sty, or the ca
ttle sty, and then the 
s -- [in d ecipherable] 
the couple of horses, after which we got br
eakfast that consisted of -- what™s that 
Italian mai ze? Anyhow, it™s something I ha
d never eaten before
, and very weak 
coffee with lot of milk. I also learn ed in th
at place to eat cheese. I never before had 
eaten cheese. And I worked ha
rd. I also had to go up on 
trees for cherries and for 
peaches, I think it was. And during thesefew weeks on the farm, I g rew about two 

and a half inches, and I became real -- talle
r. Before, I had been 
one of the shortest 
and weakest in my  class at school. 

Q: And that was your 18
th
 year? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And did you learn French? 
A: I ha -- yes. I learned French, and af
ter a few weeks the owner sent me on an 
[indecipherable] meadoww
ith a shepherds and a dozen
 heads of cattle and one 
horse. 
Q: This was to a mountain pasture? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
14
A: Yeah, and the mountain,I know -- I think it was calle
d the Pleardes. There was a 
-- an electric rail going up there to a couple of
 hotels and a hut that belonged to th e -
- th-the owner of the -- of the farm, and w
ho had to su pply milk to these hotels, and 
who would ca -- have to carry it up on hi
s back? Me. Was interesting because you 
had to be careful not to be chased by 
some steer, or -- even though the meadows 
were separated by -- thank you. These are thin
gs I don™t thing I -- I wrote if e-every 
-- anywhere. I -- I don™t know whether it™s ri
ght to go in all th
e detail with you. 
Q: I think it is. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah.  

A: In -- the Swiss national holiday, is 11
th
 of August, and for th
is holiday we built a 
big stack of wood on the ar-arm -- on the me
adow, and put fire to it in the evening. 
And all around the lake you could see fires 
from sta -- from these, that™s how they 
celebrated the holiday. And after that 
I went to one of the hotels for -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- to eat and drink as mu
ch as you wanted . I -- then, shortly after that, my  father 
found me a job as apprentice in that Sc
hillay-Bruksela company. And I left, not 
before the owner of the one hotel had told  
me how much he appreciated the fact that 
when I was in the kitchen in
 th e mo rning, bringing him -- them their milk, and he 
came in, I would stand up. And fo r that he 
gave me a pipe. I started smoking a pipe 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
15
then. Also the owner of the farm g ave 
me a very nice certificate. Something 
happened during that time al
so, that I wasn™t aware of. The son of the owner had a 
girlfriend, and one day he told me, I th
ink, two weeks they are getting married. I 
wrote my  parents and send a telegram of c
ongratulations and the day of the wedding 
I put a s-suit on after my work and waited to
 be called, to the meal or whatever 
there was. Nobody called. When  I fina
lly went down , they were just about 
finishing, and I realized what 
had happened  -- [tape break] 
Q: Yes, the -- the Swiss family™s son™s marriage. 
A: Yeah. When I came down to 
dinner they were just abou t finished, and I realized 
what had happened. The bride was highly pr
egnant, and I found th at it si -- was a 
kind of marriage where the father of the 
groom had to force him to get married. And 
father and son didn™t get along too well. Bu
t as I left the farm, I got a very nice 
certificate from him, which I still have, it™
s in here somewhere, from the farm. I 
went right to a town, Holle nberg, in the Black Forest, 
where the Schillay-Bruksela 
company had their factory, and I became a 
apprentice in their o
ffice, starting with 
how to open letters without 
reading them, and go through 
all the departments of the 
office, within two years. 

Q: I wanted to make sure I understood wh er
e that was in Germany. It™s in the Black 
Forest -- 
A: Yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
16
Q: What is the nearest large city? 
A: There is, on the one -- it™s on the Black Fo
rest, the railway, and on the one side is 
Offenburg in the Rh ine -- on the side wh ere 
the Rhine is. On the 
other side there is 
Constance, on th e Lake of Constance. That
™s about in the middl
e -- in the middle of 
mountains. It™s a nice pl -- located place,and I spent there first the two apprentice 

years, and then a year, I th
ink, yeah, as employee until th
ey were forced to let me 
go. During that time th e -- th
at comp any advised me to the take the te -- the 
examination as commercial -- oh, what
 do you do, what 
would you call that? 
Commercia l assi stance , which was give
n by th e Ch amber of Commerce, of 
Freyburg. They  had their letters come thro
ugh hide -- to Offenbu
rg there, and there 
was -- they™re testing various things that 
had to do with the 
commercial, life, like 
adding and bein
g able to multiply in your head, a
nd you had to write a composition. 
I remember there was only of -- of five di
fferent titles, there was only one that had 
nothing to do with the Nazis that I could 
select, and on each -- for each kind of 
lesson, there were three people who exam
ined you, and always one was a Nazi. But 
only one of the whole lot made a nasty rema
rk  to me. And well, couldn™t be helped. 

But my -- I was lucky, because during that
 period, there had 
been some political 
upheaval, and nobody was allowed to wear
 his uniform. Otherwise I would have 
been the only civilian, I guess, and m-may not
 have been able to take that test. It 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
17
was the mo st difficult examin
ation I took ever, but it was useful. I -- I don™t know 
whether I still have the cer
tificate, I don™t think so. 
Q: When  you mentioned the nasty remark being made -- 
A: Yeah? 

Q: -- wa -- do you remember what was said? 
A: No, he wa -- he was surprised that a Je
w was allowed to take the examination.  
Q: Would that be the first time 
you remember an anti-Semitic remark? 
A: Not really, no. I mean it -- at th e office 
already, you came in in the morning, you 
didn™t say good morning, 
you said heil Hitler. And it wa
s 1934, the Nazis had been 
in -- had -- they had been 
in power for a year, and Mr. Schillay, of Schillay-
Bruksela complained 
about that remark afterwards
, but it didn™t help. You see, 
Bruksela is a Jewish partner, and Schillay 
was a -- my uncle™s friend, so -- because 
they both were -- I had been 
in school with the Jewish 
partner™s daughter, and so I 
was -- they accepted me as apprentice, but
 during ™35, the Na-Nazi trade union 
insisted that I be dismi ssed. This is a pa
yroll [indecipherable] in that place and they 
would tell -- t-tell them, if that Jew s doe
sn™t leave, you can™t dismiss any other 
seasonal employees. So I was out, I got notic
e for the end of December, ™35. But the 
beginning of December 
I went skiing in the Black Forest. I had been skiing and 
walking around by myself ever since the Na
zis started, and I liked
 it. Naturally there 
came things, but I went to a lake up in th
e mountains of the Black Forest, where I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
18
used to swim after wi -- going up th ere, 
which was a few hours walk, I came there, 
there was a sign on the lake, no Jews allo
wed. Nobody there, but that sign. And 
then, to get back in th e beginning of De
cember ™34, I went skiing and I fell and 
broke my thumb, here. Can still see it. A
nd I couldn™t write. So they let me go 
earlier and I -- I moved to Frankfurt with my 
parents, tried to find something to do 
there, which was impossible. I would have
 had a -- had to  have a permit to work, 
and the authorities wouldn™t give me one. So  I decided to leave Germany and go to 

Athens, Greece, where my sister was alrea
dy. I left -- I found
 somebody in the 
Frankfurt passport office who believed that
 I was an student of archaeology, going 
to Athens to study. I found out afterwards 
that if I went there, the police of -- for 
foreigners in Greece was already informed 
that this guy is not a student, he™s a 
refugee. 
Q: Do you reme mb er having 
discussions a-around this 
time with your parents about 
family plans and wh at should be 
done, or would yo
ur parents -- 
A: No, no. 

Q: -- not discussed it? 
A: We -- my father was still working. Afte
r he had left -- had lost the pharmacy, he 
worked as -- in public relations for two 
factory -- pharmaceutical factories, where 
he went to the universities, and told 
the students about the products of these 
companies, they should prescr
ibe it when they  became doctors and so -- so he was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
19
reasonably happy, and nobody 
believed at that time that 
the Nazi power would last, 
see? So I left, and one year la
ter we let my parents come. 
Q: Were you aware of othe
rs leaving Germany? Did -- 
did other comp arable, well-
to-do families leave? 
A: The y-younger people tried to leave.
 The older people didn™t believe that it 
lasted, or they cook -- they took their 
money and went to what was then still 

Palestine and lived on their money as long 
as they could. After the war, probably 

went back. But -- and so I went to At
hens, and I had a typewriter and I had a 
[indecipherable], and we -- I found work  
in Athens. I took my  typewriter from one 
office to the other, made [i
ndecipherable] correspondence in English, French  and 
German. Sometimes people who didn™t know
 either of these languages, or very 
little, they had to trust that 
I would write what they said
, and it worked out all right 
for three years in Athens.  

Q: Now, which of your sisters was in Athens? 

A: Ilsa, the older one. My 
younger sister had gone on a farm. She had joined  the 
Jewish organization to eventually go to
 Israel. And my mother™s uncle, Joseph 

Berliner, helped her to get a -- a job,
 and she worked th
ere until the -- that 
organization had to evacuate and they took
 the young people to
 Denmark. On the 
way from that farm to Denmark, my si
ster Margaret found herself a husband, 
Irwin.. What was his last name, d arn it? 
Irwin -- and they got 
married. They were 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
20
both in Denmark, and then the organizati
on, the -- what was it [indecipherable] is 
that it, the name? And they 
took th em to England, and th
e both of them worked on a 
farm in Devonshire, where my -- where 
they had a little boy. And they still had 
intended to go to  Israel, but even tually hi
s mother convinced th
em to come to the 
United States. But that was after the war. Now, in Athens, I had a lot of fun. I was at 
the age where I didn™t think about tomorrow or
 the next day. I was able to have a 
good income, and I learned the Greek lang
uage in no time because I had learned 
ancient Greek at the -- at the high school. [i
ndecipherable] tickets 
to the theater, and 
there was another one who had just come 
fro m Turkey, that was 
shortly -- actually 
only 10 years after the exchange of popul
ation between Turkey and Greece. And I 
fortunately could help him quite a bit. Then
 the important jobs I had there, one was 
only in a technical office, the engineer sp
oke well German and French  and imported 
whole electrical works from Europe. So
me parts from Germany, some from 
Switzerland. And I did the correspondence and 
kept the books for three years. We -- 
the owner was reasonably friendly, at a distance, and once he warned me -- I g o t too 
friendly with an associate of his who wa
s in the same office, and when that 
associate separated himself, then I hear
d from my  boss that I should watch out, not 
tell him anything, so on. That associate had 
been a officer in the -- in the Marine of 
the Greek fleet, and he at one time invite
d me, which was interestin g, to his home 
for dinner. Which -- it was a big honor, be
cause for one thing, the man was not 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
21
married, he lived with his parents and his 
sist er. And the father was a Greek priest. 
So, the men were eating on the table, a
nd the women were serving the food. And 
after -- after dinner, they started singing a
nd all si -- sin g ing an
d dancing around th e 
table. This was one thing -- something new 
for me. But the -- as I say, my boss was 
not happy about me being too 
friendly with the -- this one. 
Q: And you were able to br
ing your parents to Greece? 

A: One year after I arrived, my father lo
st his job. They  made a law in Germany, 
where about five or six pe -- Jews were 
doing that kind of work , but that was no 
longer allowed, so my pare
nts took a vacation to Italy,
 where my sister I lsa met 
them, and they --

th

Holocaust Memorial Museum™s

Frederick Wohl on 
Novemb er the 20 -- 22
nd
, 1989. The United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum 
gratefully acknowledges Jeff
 and Toby Herr for making 
this interview possible. 
This is tape number two, side A. We we re talking about your parents and your 
bringing them to Athens. 

A: Yeah. My father had 
been able to secure th
e representation of the 
[indecipherable] in Greece. 
They were pretty nice to
 him, realizing wh at was 
happening, and he had met friends there. 
So, for one year afte
r leaving Germany, 
they paid  him a salary, and 
we rented an apartment in the center of Athens, where 
my mother kept house, and my sister Il
sa and I lived there with my parents. 
Naturally, I only saw them for breakfast, be
cause I worked late, and I, most days, 
went out after that. And my  father went ar
ound trying to get so
me industrialists to 
undertake to work with th
at company who -- whom he
 represented, but nothing 
came of it. He was the only one in the fam
ily who actually got 
a permit to stay in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
23
Greece, and to work in Greece. My sister ne
ver got a work permit, and I never got a 
proper work permit, either. 
Q: Why was your father granted the permit? 

A: He was employed, see, by a foreign co
mpany, yet. I always
 had to be on th e 
outlo ok for agents of the police department 
trying to catch me at work. Th-They did 
a couple of times and brought me into th
e police center, but friends, young lawyers 
already, usually found the soft spot and 
I was released, with 
the exception of the 
very last time. My work in Athens al
so encomp assed long hours of work  at a 
newspaper distributing agency where I went 
at about four or five o™clock in th e 
afternoon and usually stayed
 til eight or nine. What ha
d happened is that I was 
given the name of the owner of the empo -- 
of that agency. The 
name of the agen cy 
was Spiro Svengalis, and the general mana
ger owner was Janus Anagnostopoulos. 
Anagnostopoulos saw 
me in his office and after 
asking who had recommended me -
- was a -- the man who supplied th em their 
paper stock, he was satisfied and took 
me, without anything fu rther, to the baseme
nt. There was a big office, and we had 
to talk in French 
because Anagnostopoulos only knew
 a few words of French and I 
didn™t know enough Greek at that time. Be
hind the desk in that office was sitting a 
young German with not one 
but two party signs on his ja
cket, and he told me, in 
French, that he had to leav
e for the Fatherland right away, and here is the book in  
the work s, and good-bye. He never found 
out that I was German, and he took the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
24
German embassy all s -- all these y ears to
 realize who I was. The agency imported 
German newspapers as a sideline, and 
French and British and Czech and Swiss 
newspapers. That was a department of fo
reign press, which I was certainly in 
charge of. And I didn't change anything mu ch
, but a number of German residents in 
Athens were subscribing to  German newp
aper -- Nazi newspapers and after looking 
through the books, I sent a young man wh
o was employed there to go and collect 
for the mo nthly rent, or three monthly re
nt, I don™t remember. Anyhow, he came 
back and said every one of his guys had 
a receipt. So my British [indecipherable] 
had gone off with quite a bit of mone
y. I figured out it was about a hundred 
thousand dollars. And I had 
to go to An agnostopoulos 
after a few days work ing 
there and telling him look, there a h
undred thousand dollars missing. And 
fortunately he took it all right, and advan
ced money to  my  department. And he was 
otherwise satisfied at that 
time. A few months later he 
called me at the engineering 
office, I had to come immediately . So I we
nt over to -- to  his office, and he was up -
- very upset. The censor, the government 
censor had called and 
told him that the 
one German newspaper had publish -- had 
published an article about the Greek 
Crown Prince having an affair with a lady 
in Athens, and that naturally should not 
be distributed. But we had di
stributed said paper alrea
dy. We only got 20 or 25 
copies, was another import office for foreig n newspaper, they got more -- got more 

offices. So what to do? I took a taxi a
nd went from one newspaper kiosk to the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
25
other, and bought 25 c
opies of that particular newspa
per, I cut the top off, and could 
s -- prove that well, we had not distributed
 it, and we were in the clear. The owner 
of the other office ended up on an island for a few months, and I had from then on 
the additional job to look through the va
rious papers and make sure that nothing 
was written about the Greek royal family. An
agnostopoulos had the 
idea to start an 
illustrated weekly inAthens
 ak -- on the type of paper that was [indecipherable] 
very nice weeklies that the newspapers had 
on Sundays in Europe. He got lists and 
he ordered the machinery. Money was no pr
oblem with him, but the instructions 
were in German, which he didn™t unde
rstand and I didn™t know enough Greek 
mechanical words to put it 
in Greek, so I translated 
it into French
. When the 
machinery came, and was put in the free ha
rbor before import. When -- when we 
left Greece it was still there, I don™t know 
whether -- what ever 
happened to it. But 
at the end of ™40 -- of ™39 -- 

Q: When you -- 

A: -- things in Greece went bad for us. It seems the German embassy found out who 
was work ing there, and who -- who was se
nt -- looking through th e papers, and 
Anag nostopoulos couldn™t do an ything any mo
re to keep me. So the police told us, 
you have to leave Greece, or we
 take you back to Germany.
 So then, t-to
 show them 
how serious they were, they put me not in 
jail, but -- but into a police office, where 
I stayed three or four days, after w h ich we
 could make them realize that while my 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
26
father and my  sister were working to find
 wh ere to go, I should be doing th at too, 
and not stay in the police wh -- thing. We
 went from one consulate and embassy to 
another, and nothing ha
ppened til the consul of Paraguay  said yes, he could -- we 
could go to Paraguay. But wh en  we in
quired  at the American Express about 
traveling there, they told us that countrydoesn™t have the power to give you a visa. 
You have to go to Italy, to the general consul, and forg et it. 
Q: Now, you were able to use your mo
ther™s connection with a former foreign 
secretary of the -- 
A: Yeah, now -- 
Q: -- Weimar Republic. 

A: -- during that time, when things got real 
bad, we were trying ot
her kinds of visits 
and this and such. Now, my  father had been
 a Mason for all these years. In Athens 
he went to  attend Masonic meetings of 
a Freemason™s Lodge that [indecipherable] 
in German. And at a big dinner there that
 was given in honor of a British duke, he 
happened  to  sit next to a young fellow who-- with wh om he started talking and he -
- that fellow was a secretary to the Britis
h ambassador. They got friendly and that 
young fellow, he took my  daughter skiing, and -- 
Q: This is -- 

A: -- that was before -- before things got so bad. 
Q: That was your siste r.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
27
A: But when -- when things 
got real bad, my  father got to him and asked for help, 
one -- one Mason to  another. And the 
man got him an audien ce with the 
ambassador, the ki -- British ambassado
r, who listened to the story and i-
immediately started investiga
ting the family. Now, my moth
er had a third or fourth  
cousin whose name was -- 
Q: I think it was R-Rathenow, right? 
A: Rathenow, Walter Rathenow. And he had 
been German foreign minister in the 
first Republican government after the firs
t World War. And he had been mu rdered 
in 1920 th -- two or ™23. His -- his brot
her, Emile Rathenow was a big industrialist 
in Germany, but that Walter Rathenow, th
ere was some connec tion to my mother, 
and the British f -- office for -- that inve
stigated people found
 that out and the 
ambassador told my father, well you -- you can go wherever you want in the British 
area, but we had no money. 
Q: What -- what was the reason th at the -- that connection would -- 

A: That we were -- we were -- 
Q: -- you know, persuade th
e British to give support? 
A: They were -- we were
 pressured to get out. 
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: And we tried everybody and everything, 
and this was about the last, because you 
couldn™t just go into the British embassy. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
28
Q: Yeah. It would be because 
as members o f that family -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- you were in opposition to the Nazis. 

A: We were as -- we were certainly Britis
h protected persons, a
ll four, and he asked 
us, well where -- what did yo
u go -- where would you go 
to? The closest place to 
Greece was the island of Cypr
us, which was British, an
d we thought we make 
arrangements and go there. But the governor
 of Cyprus wanted each person to  show 
1,000 pounds sterling. 4,000 pounds ster
ling we didn™t have. So the British 
ambassador, again, he managed to get this
 fee on th -- this guarantee reduced to 

1,000 pounds for the whole fami
ly, but we didn™t have 1,000
 pounds. So I talked to 
anapel -- Anagnosto
poulos in the newspaper distri
buting office and asked him for 
help. And he said well, he would lend 
me 500 pounds, provided I could get the 
other 500 from somebody else. And he even  talked to the engineer, the engineering 

office, got him to also lend me wa -- 500 
pounds. So  see we -- we are -- were all 
right to go to  Cyprus, and after six 
months, I send them their money back. 
Q: Now were you welcomed 
on the island of Cyprus? 
A: Not really, but we were refugees, like 
th ere were a few hundred other refugees 
there, and -- 

Q: And there was a Jewish community  that had been th ere from 1905. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
29
A: Well, they -- it was not really a comm
unity, was a couple of families, who lived 
all over the island, who had came together 
for the high holidays. [indecipherable] 
with one family who had big orange and 
grapefruit groves in Famagusta. There was 
a physician who was the center of the Je
wish community, actually, who owned a 
Torah, and where they  had their high holid
ay services, an d where I went with my 
father to services.  
Q: What was your -- your own,
 and your family™s state of
 mind at this time? Were 
you becoming mo re despondent? 
A: We were -- we were very nervous til we
 were in Cyprus, and my -- we first had 
very little money to get establish ed, but my 
sister got an -- a job in an attorney™s 
office from two brothers, and I got an corres
pondent thing in an import office, for 
one pound sterling a week. So we got along
 and on the day Italy entered the war, 
there was a note on my typewriter, we do 
not employ enemy aliens, good-bye. My 
next job was with two refugees from Vien
na who had had some money invested in 
a sausage factory in Cyprus, where they ma
de good sausages, even after the earlier 
owners, this man, had left, he had showed 
them how to  do it, but none of these two 
knew the right languages. So I came -- I was useful to them, sellin g their sausages 

in a little store. 

Q: Now your parents, I think, were em
barrassed by your work , selling sausag es. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
30
A: Yeah, we had rented  a small house on 
the outskirts of Nicosia. Nicosia is the 
capital of Cyprus. They didn™t -- they neve
r came in to the sausage factory, the 
sausage store, but they liked the sausage 
wh en I brought it home. I met through this, 
naturally, quite a few people, refugees in
 Cyprus, and was able to make my self 
useful here and there. 
Q: Now, it would seem that you, from the 
time you were 18 and wo rked  on the farm 
in Switzerland, that you were being fo
rced to  assume adult responsibilities -- 
A: To [indecipherable] 

Q: Well, much m -- at 
a much younger age -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- than would have been the case were
 it not for the Nazi power. But at what 
stage do you think you were becoming the 
leader and decision maker, as comp ared 
to your father? 

A: Yeah, we did that together, but there 
was no way out. See, we were thrown  into 
Greece, we were thrown into Cyprus, and 
from Cyprus we were 
thrown into East 
Africa eventually. There was 
not mu ch choice. The same I came here, I happened to 
get into an insuran
ce office as a bookkeeper. I learned the insurance business, and 
that was it, I didn™t have any choice, but 
I came to like it. I decided that if I sell 
anyone insurance, once he ha
s it he was better off than he had been  befo re I sold it 
to him. And so I cam
e to like my work. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
31
Q: Did you -- did you consider
 other options in terms of
 a country wh ere you would 
build  your life? I mean, did you think of -- 
A: I -- 

Q: -- Israel, or returning to Germany after the war? 

A: No, I -- no, I did not. And my parents we
re not Zionists. And the only th ing I -- I 
wanted to become a CPA, but at that time the 
rules were so strict in the district -- I 

think they still are, that a young man ha
d to become apprenti
ced to another CPA 
and wouldn™t make any mone
y during that time. On the contrary, some of 
[indecipherable] required a paymen t. So th at 
was out. So I went to the university to 

eventually  get a degree -- not 
that I needed it by that time, 
but I just wanted to  get it 
and I le -- learned the insuran
ce business, and started selling. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let me go back. We -- we are jumping -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- from Cyprus to Unite
d States, but in fact your -- your time spent in -- 
A: In Cyprus? 
Q: -- in East Africa is
 covered in your -- 
A: Which [indecipherable] 
Q: -- is covered in the earlier vi
deotaped in tervie
w done in 1989. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But when the war ended in -- the 
second World War ended in 1945 -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
32
A: Yeah. 
Q: How -- what did you do immedi
ately after the war, and what -- 
A: I -- 
Q: -- what arrangements had to be
 made for coming to the States? 
A: I tried to get another affidavit. You 
see, a very distant relative again, named 
Edgar Berliner lived in Canada and afterwar
ds in California, and he, when  the Nazis 
came, made arrangements for a group of you
ng people to come to Canada to start a 
farm of some kind. He -- he was pretty 
wealthy and to his surprise, by the time he 
was developing that plan, I was the only on e left to go. And naturally that -- that 

plan was out. We kept corresponding, and 
he was helpful to me. He sometimes sent 
me small amounts of money. Very small.
 He -- I only learned that he was a 
millionaire -- I -- I learned -- learned that la
ter. And he -- when I was in Athens he 
gave me an affidavit to come here, but by
 the time these papers
 arrived, we were 
already thrown out of Greece,
 and they sent the papers
 on to Cyprus -- no, to 
Jerusalem. And there were quite
 a few refugees in Cyprus in
 the same situation, that 
they had the papers, but the American consul
 was in Cairo and he
 wasn™t anxious to 
have any Jews come to America. He didn™t
 -- even if a couple of hundred  people 
ready to come, he wouldn™t come to Cyprus 
to see them and inte
rview them. So that 
was out and my affidavit eventually was -- 
was out of -- it wa -- had a limit, a time 
limit.

Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Fred erick Wohl. This is tape number two, side B. 
A: -- refugees to come. It was expressed 
after the conferen ce of Evia, and the only 
family I know who came to America at that
 time was the personal physician of the 
Crown Prince of Greece, a Dr. Miller, I think,
 with whom my father afterwards was 
in touch in the States. 
Q: When  you came to the United States 
-- you™ve told  me a little about your 
decision, but I wonder if you™d tell me more about the -- about your parents and 
their discussions about where 
they would go after the war. 
A: My parents did not know wh ere to go af
ter the war. After I had left Tanganyika, 
they made arrangements to be taken back 
to  Cyprus. And since my  father could not 
find any employment on Cyprus, th
ey insisted to come to 
the States. And my sister 
and I signed a affidavits for them, they 
came over and we had a tough time to make 
ends meet. At that time my parents stayed 
in the States first 
in Mount Vernon, New 
York, and then here in Wash
ington, but nothing work ed out
 for my father, and they 
returned in 1950 to 
Tanganyika, where my  father got a job as -- at the pharmacy of 
an Indian in -- I think in 
Yoringa, I don™t remember th
e [indecipherable] where they 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
34
stayed until my father™s hea
lth deteriorated, and the doct
or told him he had to get 
out of the tropics. [indecipherable] 
Q: I want to -- I -- please tell me about 
your voyage to the Un ited States when you 

came, and what it wa
s like on board ship. 
A: Yes. I s -- I still have the ticket fro
m the British shipping line, I thi -- from D ar 
Es Salaam to the first port in the United 
States. The trip took ab out two months, and 
was very interesting. The only limit for 
me was that I didn™t have any money to 
enjoy the stops at the various places. They
 boat arrived in Dar Es Salaam while I 
was in bed with a malaria atta
ck. I looked out of the wind
ow of the hotel and when I 
saw the boat coming in, I really got well very
 fast and packed up and got aboard. It 
was a Kaiser ship that allowed about 
20 passengers to co me on board, and th e 
cabins and so were not very luxurious, but 
I was glad to be on my  way. The boat 
stopped first in Durb an, South Afri
ca, where one of the passengers had 
acquaintances and they  took 
us to one of the South A
frican National Parks, which 
was an interesting experience, and wh ile 
we were looking over the mountains and 
had left the windows of the car open, a bu
nch of mo nkeys got in the car, and ate the 

fruits that we had brought for 
our lunch. The other memo ry I have of Durb an  is that 
I called my  mo ther™s great-uncle, Joseph W
ilde, in Johannesburg and to ld him that 
the boat was slow and I could 
come and visit him, but he was not interested. He sent 
me some money instead and I have never be
en in touch with him again. I tried to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
35
obtain his address afterwards, even  th
rough the Jewish co
ngrega -- Jewish 
organizations in Johannesburg, without resu
lt. The next stop of the boat was Cape 
Town  wh ere we stopped a few days also, a
nd I inspected the town . The weather was 
not good enough to go up th
e Cape Town mountain, th e cape mo untain, which was 
unfortunate, and actually th-the only memo ry 
of Cape Town I have is that when you 
went in the mo -- to the m
ovies there, the ticket included an ice cream or a cookie, 
or a piece of cake, which they offered to
 you during the runn
ing of the movie, 
through a salesperson. Fr
om Cape Town , the boat went to -- hold it a mo ment. 
Q: We™ll ignore the name. 
A: Yeah. The next stop was a harbor in  
wh at is now Namibia, southwest Africa, 
which was a real godforsaken place, all sa
nd, with the exception of a couple of 
breweries and th e railroad station. In this 
place they had a crew of workers who did 
nothing else but keep  the railroad -- the rails
 clean of desert sand, because there was 
a constant wind, and there was nothing to  
keep the sand away 
from the rails. We 
stopped there only fo r a short while and 
from then on, went 
across the ocean to 
Trinidad. In Trinidad
 the boat could not -- we -- we
 could not go ashore because 
they had a general strike, and after a couple of
 days the boat went on to Bermuda. In 
Bermuda I had my  last bad malaria attack, on 
the second day there. I had to take to 

bed, and for the rest of the stop in Berm
uda, I was in bed. What I remember of 
Bermuda is the fact that the lunch in the 
restaurants there cost as mu ch as a whole

day in a hotel in Dar Es Salaam, which ma
de a difference to my pocket. The boat 
then went onto New Brunswick
, to Saint John. And we st
opped then after a couple 
of days, the shipping line decided that th
ey were going to st
ay there much longer 
than anticipated, and we should make our a
rrangements to get to the States by alls 
else. I took my last money fo r a ticket to
 New York, and took off. I was -- til then, 
actually always on my  -- I had in mind 
that coming from where I came from, and 
going across the frontiers, somebody would 
stop me and have a ser -- and search, 
whether I brought any diamonds with me
. But I didn™t. Maybe I wasn™t smart 
enough, but I was anxious to get to the Stat
es without any trouble, and met my sister 
Margaret and her husband at the -- what™s 
the station in New York? At the railroad 
station in New York. 

Q: Grand Central? 
A: No, the other one. 
Q: Penn.  

A: Hm? 
Q: Penn. 
A: Penn Station, yeah. 

Q: Penn Station. 

A: I had never met my  brother-in-law,
 it was interesting fellow with whom, 
however, I did not get 
too well acquain ted over the shor
t time that I saw th -- him. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
37
My sister and her husband at that time were
 w o rking as a couple 
in an old age place 
in Mount Vernon, New York , where the ow
ner lady made room for me for a couple 
of days. I was surprised at the kind of wo rk
 they did, but got us
ed to the fact that 
any work here in th
e States was o k ay.  
Q: I have lo ts of questions. 
A: Yes? 
Q: I want you to tell me more about the meet
ing with your sister. 
It mu st have been 
very emotional. Did she know you? Did you know her at once? Had she changed? 
A: She know -- yes, we knew -- we know 
each other, but there was no time to be 
emotional, anything. Was a crowd of people
 and we got from one train to the other 
and then  to -- took th e train to Mount Ve
rnon, sat there looking at each other and 
realized that we were not as young as 
we used to be, but there™s nothing exciting 
otherwise. 
Q: Mm-hm. And wh at luggage did you ha
ve with you that you™d been carrying 
then? You™d presumably brought a -- a few personal possessions? 
A: I -- I don™t re -- don™t really recall. It couldn™t have been mu ch. 
Q: No diamonds. 

A: It couldn™t have been much. I didn
™t even have a winter coat, and it was 
December, or no, the end of November.  
Q: And I assume that the malaria meant 
you were really in very poor health? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
38
A: No, it wasn't too bad. A-As I say, ma
 -- th at was my last malaria attack, in 
Bermuda, and after that I took two -- twi
ce I went thro ugh th e medications for 
malaria. I should remember 
the name, it sta -- it starte
d with A, but I don™t. In 
Mount Vernon I -- I didn™t sit around long. I went to New York and got scared by 

the traffic. I got -- couple of times I got
 marooned in the middle of a street, and I 
had to learn to dodge automobiles. I hadn't 
s e en  so  man y au to mo
biles in a lifetime. 
And I spent time in the big stores, just 
lo-looking what was going on there. And 
decided to  visit Washington. I, at that tim
e, was of the opinion that the man who 
had given me the affidavit,
 and who lived  in Ho llywood wanted  me to come  over 

there, but I got a letter telling me more or le
ss that if I fo und something to do in the 
east, we would meet early enough. I had 
never met the man, his name was Edgar 
Berliner. So the day I got that letter, I took the train to Washington, wh ere I had an  
address of an attorney, I found out he™s qu
ite a prominent attorney, to -- with whom 
to get in contact. He was -- his wife was th
e sister of the man who had given me the 
affidavit. And this was a time where Wash
ington was crowded with people wo rking 
on the war effort, and if it hadn™t been for 
that recommendation, I would never have 
been able to get a room in 
a hotel. But they were nice to me, I had dinner there, and 
the lady, Louise King, took me around
 Washington by car and to Mo unt Vern on 
and to the cemet -- cemetery, and to a c
oncert, and showed me the -- where the 
mu seums were, and I was on my  own for a co
uple of days, during which I found an  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
39
employment agency, and applied for jobs. 
The man sent me immediately to two 
places where -- where peoples were -- were as
ked for and in both 
places I evidently 
made a good enough impression that he af
terwards told me I could select which 
one. And I did not. I went that evening to 
have dinner with the Kings, and told th em 
what had been happening. Wh en  -- Milton we
nt to the phone and came back and he 
said his brother™s insurance agency al-also needed a boo
kkeep er or accountant, and 
gave me the address, I should go th ere the 
next day. Naturally, that was a place to 

go. Even  so the pay, as I afterwards
 found out, was very low fo r American 
purposes. But being recommended,
 I went. I found a room on 16
th
 Street, 1827 16
th
 
Street, and I rented it, then went back 
to New York  and got my  stuff and started 
working a f -- a few days in December. It 
was an insurance agen
cy and there were -- 
it was interesting for me because the bookke
eper, an old lady, had kept her records 
for the past couple of years at least, on pi
eces of paper and I had to put it together to 
be accepted by an -- a CPA. I forgot to men
tion that before being accepted by these 
people as employee, they sent me to thei
r CPA for an interview, and I ga -- I was 
friendly with this CPA for 
quite a number of years. He was a -- an older man who 
was the head of the CPA organization in
 Washington. Not on
ly that, he was a 
director of the Franklin Accounting Scho
ol, where both his sons -- is -- both his 
son-in-laws had been put thr
ough accounting before they c
ould marry his daughters.  
Q: At that time you would be planni
ng or hoping to train as a CPA? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
40
A: Yeah. I had no in tention to do someth
ing else but accountin
g and naturally to 
write -- to find out how to beco me a CPA, 
especially after the experience in Africa, 
where I was unable to stay, to
 some extent also, because they wanted a -- what they 
in England called a chartered accountan t for 
the diamond mine. I also registered in 
the university in Washington. It took a -- I went from one university to the other 

because this was a time where all of the 
students were studying under the -- what 
they call the war. They didn™t pay there. 
I was the only paying student in American 
Univ ersity and that university was favorab
le fo r me because the ma n who to ok care 
of foreign students was a former G erman andhe was helpful to me in my studies for 
the years I was at the university. 

Q: So every local college was -- 
university was full of G.I. bills? 
A: G.I. [indecipherable]. I mean, they were 
not interested in a paying student, but 
this man, Professor Correlle, was happy to help me. 

Q: And that was at American University? 

A: At American University. At that time 
the university had classes in some half 
fallen down  buildings on F Street in 
northwest Washington. And I naturally 
registered for evening classe
s, where they had interesting lecturers who came to the 
mo st part from government and really kne
w their -- knew wh at they had to teach. 
Especially interesting was one course on in
come tax, which was a course mo re or 
less on income tax avoiding.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
41
Q: How f -- yeah? 
A: But that took awhile -- took awhile to
 get to that. The other thing I did after 
arriving and getting settled, I registered at Arthur Murray™s, because I didn™t know 
anybody and thought well, at least I coul
d dance, I might meet some people there 
and at least get a little bit more social. Beca
use all I knew to talk about was my stay 
in Africa, and who was interested  in that? 
People were only interested in the news 
with Walter Winchell. The other thing I did, 
after a few days I found that the Jewish 
Center was only a couple of blocks from 
my  room, and I went there and fo und a 
few other young men who had come from Germany, and got introduced to th em, 

and we had a -- had a circle of friends fro
m there, with whom we got together. We 
had a poker round and I attended some social
 functions at the Jewish Center on 16
th
 
Street. Through the friends, I 
got into a Jewish thr -- a 
circle of young women of 
marriageable age, who were ready to party.
 We had hayrides, a
nd every few months 
a wedding, which was new to me all, and I re
alized that I had to be careful, because 

it was time to keep a dist
ance from these young ladies, 
until I -- unless I would be 
serious. Having nothing but a job, natura
lly to think of getti
ng settled down in a 
marriage was tough. In 1948, I attended a 
dance in, I™d say, 
a Jewis h  Co mmu nity  
Center, and met my future wife. It was [i
ndecipherable] my  friends were all there 

and after the dance I took Lillian to a bar just to talk and have a drink and 
afterwards walked her home, wh ich took 
hours, because she lived in a women™s 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
42
build ing on the other side of the Po tomac.  And naturally, we walked there, and 
afterwards I walked back at
 night, for hours again, to
 16 Street. And I dated this 
young lady every -- whenever I could. Sh e 
made sure that I on our dates, spend 
whatever money I had so that I 
couldn™t date anybody else.  
Q: Was it love at first sight, do
 you think? Do you remem -- 
A: What? 

Q: I wondered if you were
 taken with her as soon as you saw her, or -- 
A: Yeah.

Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This 
is an interview with Frederick Wohl, condu
cted by Margaret West, on February the 
17
th
, 2004, in Bethesda, Maryland. This inte
rview is part of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum™s
 post-Holocaust interview 
project, and is a follow up 
interview to a USHMM videotaped interv
iew conducted with 
Frederick Wohl on 
November the 22
nd
, 1989. The United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum 
gratefully acknowledges Jeff
 and Toby Herr for making 
this interview possible. 
This is tape number three, side A. 
A: -- to go back to my wo
rk, I walked every morning 
from my residence to the 
office, stopped fo r a cup of -- for breakfast
 at a little Greek restaurant and it was 
tough to  make ends meet with the pay I r
eceived at that time, which was originally 
quoted as 50 dollars a week
, but m -- no, it was quoted as 200 a month, 200 dollars 
a month. No w -- no, was 50 dollars a week, but wh en it came to payday, I was 

corrected, it was less because of
 Social Security and health 
insurance, and as I say, I 
-- after a few months, asked for 
a raise. I got a small raise,
 as far as I remember. But 
they mainly said, why don™t you go and 
sell insurance? And I took a course in 
insurance that was given by the Aetn
a Insurance Company,
 a correspondence 
course, and got a license to sell insurance 
in the District of 
Columbia. I remember 
the first insurance I sold wa
s on [indecipherab le] a lady in the rooming house where 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
44
I stayed had been  given by one of her admi
rers. I was rather tim
id at that time -- 
time. I couldn™t talk about anything interes
ting to people, because -- as I say again, 
who was interested in -- in Africa, or in
 Cyprus? I had nothing mu ch to say about 
America, only that I was glad to be ther
e and it was interesti
ng and I was going to 
stay. 
Q: What about your 
bond with Lillian?  
A: That we -- I -- we continued 
to date and in 1948, October 31
st
, my friend Bernie 
Friedberg got married to his wife Charlo
tte. And that night, on the -- on the way 
home to her place, I popped th e question and got accepted, which got me so excited 
that after I had left her, on my
 home, I got violently seasick. 
Q: On your long walk? 
On your long walk back? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Ho-H ow old were you both then?  
A: I was about 35 -- 30 -- yeah, 34 and a 
half, and she was six years younger. I 
reme mb er she had given me her age, I think wa -- one year younger than she 
actually was. I met, during the -- that time,
 her sister and brother-in-law, who lived 
in Washington, and who were very hospitabl
e, and as I assumed, they were glad 
that Lillian had a boyfriend. 
Q: Tell me about her family and b
ackground and religion and so on. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
45
A: And they were -- they were Jewish, not -- not too religious, and the m-mother 
lived in New York, the father 
just died about that time, 
I never met him. And it took 
awhile til I met her mo ther, who lived in
 a -- a suburb of New York, west New 
York, in a small apartment. It was all, 
naturally, a new experi
ence for me, even the 
driving in so mebody el -- with somebody 
else to -- to New York , at a time when 
there was n-no superhig hway. And it took ne
arly a day to get where we wanted to 
go. My  parents, in the meantime, had arrive
d in the States, and they were not very 
happy with my  getting engaged. 
My  parents, to some extent I think, had expected I -

- I would make a good living in  America a
nd that I would be able to take care of 
them. Seeing that that was not going to  
be the case, our relationship after my  
marriage was a little bit estranged, and th
ey made arrangements to go back to 
Africa. My sister and her hus
band were still in Tanganyika
, and they indicated that 
there was work for my father
 and they would be standi
ng by them. They left New 
York a few weeks after the birth of 
my first d aughter, that was Jackie. 
Q: Tell me the full name of -- well, this is
 a good time to tell 
me th e full name of 
both of your daughters and 
their dates of birth.  
A: It™s Jacq ueline Diane Wohl, who is 
by now Tinney, but she uses her maiden 

name professionally, she™s an attorney with
 her own office. My younger daughter is 
Valerie Ann Wohl, who is single after a very
 short marriage. And who also uses her 
maiden name. She is a physician. Both
 my  daughters live in Tucson, Arizona. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
46
Q: And what was the -- what -- what we
re their birthdates, or approximately? 
A: What™s your birthdat
e, Jackie? It™s 1950. 
A2: June 26
th
. 
A: Hm? 
A2: June 26. 
A: June 26, and June 27 is when  m-my  
seco nd wedding. And Va
lerie™s birthday is 
March 19? 
A2: May --  
A: Hm? 
A2: May 17
th
, 1952. 
A: May 17
th
, yeah, ™52. Going back 
to the time of the engage
ment, I found that not 
only was I not making much money at that 
time, but also Lillia
n, who worked for 
the Navy as an clerk, had not much of an
 in co me, but also had so me debt, wh ich she 
kept secret from me an d paid off during 
the first month of our marriage. We see 
how -- 
Q: So how did you find out about it? 
A: Afterwards. I think that that 
was mainly her bridal outfit.  
Q: I wondered to wh at extent you shared va
lues in life an d whether that was part of 
the reason for your getting along well together? 
A: Getting who? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
47
Q: Well, I™m interested in
 knowing whether you had shar
ed values in the way you 
approached life, and -- 
A: No. I had, during my travels always fallen into some kind of existence which 

was interesting and where I enjoyed life to 
-- naturally to a limited extent, whatever, 
but I don™t recall that I was ever, let™s 
say, unhappy with what I was doing. And 
getting into the accounting and insu rance 
in Washington wa
s no exception. 
Q: You sound resilie
nt and optimistic. 
A: Oh yeah, I -- I did a study ab out insuranc
e, but I took a first life insurance course 
with the -- an agent of th
e Penn Life, and even sold a couple of life insurance 
policies. I don™t know whether they™re s
till in force, because at that time a 
commission was only continued by the co
mpany fo r 10 years, and the commission 
was paid to the office I wait -- I w o rked for. 
I learned a few [indecipherable] if -- if 
my selling insurance is conc
erned, and had let a -- Bill 
had [indecipherable] with 
my  name and made sure that whatever
 insurance I sold was going to  be my  
busin ess. It can™t be done any mo re toda
y. I found that out by experience, but I 

eventually built up a nice book 
of business in spite of the 
fact that I just could not 
go and do any co ld calls, as they called, 
for -- to buy -- to sell insurance, unless I 
had a recommendation or referral. I was not courag eous enough to
 get in and talk, 
besides the fact that I didn™t need  a
ny -- didn™t know en ough in surance -- of 
insurance, in the beginning.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
48
Q: But you -- you enjoyed it. 
A: Yeah. I had developed the ki
nd of philoso phy that if I 
sell you insura
nce, when I 
leave you™re better off than you were when
 I came in, an d that kept me going.  
Q: Where did you live after your marriage? 
A: My brother-in-law manage
d to get us an apartment 
in Arlington at North Taft 
Street. It w as a small apartment without ai
r conditioning, so if we wanted, we kept 

doors and windows open, not 
only for our apartment, but
 the other apartment on the 
same floor. We™d got friendly with these 
people, which was a good thing because 
they had a car, we didn™t. 
I took the bus every mo rning from Arlington Boulevard 
into town. And Wash
ington su burbs at that time
 were still such a friendly 
surrounding that sometim
es even people wo uld stop and pick me up, gave me a ride 
into the city. You couldn™t do that any mo re.  
Q: And that™s where the girls w
ould go to school, in Arlington? 
A: Oh no. [indecipherable] 
we lived not too long in Arlington. Oh, let me go back 
to our wedding. 

Q: Oh. 
A: This is -- is -- somewhere I have a pi
cture of the wedding party, which was my  
mo ther-in-law, a nephew of hers who was 
a policeman in Washington, my  sister-in-
law and brother-in-law and 
their little daughter Andrea
, and Margo was -- I think 
Margo was there, yes. My parents and my 
brother-in-law, with their little boy, and a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
49
girlfriend of Lillian™s and how I met who was 
the second rabbi I had talked to about 
getting married. The first rabbi, whose name
 I won™t me ntion, was too business-like 
for me at th e interview, and Rabbi Metz 
was very understanding of the fact that I 
was not very religious, neither was, actua
lly, Lillian. And we -- we got married in 
his study, in his home. And I was so little  knowledge about, at that time, that 
without thinking of anything I invited th
e rabbi for dinner, for the wedding dinner, 
and naturally he didn™t come. Another guest 
at the dinner was cousin Joe. That was 
a distant relative, and if I -- I should rememb er his full name, because he was 

important. 
Q: Sanders? 

A: Hm? 

Q: Sanders? Joe Sanders?  
A: Yeah, Joe Sanders. Joe Sanders was also
 married into the Be
rliner family, and 
was an important man in that family. You 
see, there was one Berliner who invented 
the Gramophone record and he was not a poor man. His brother, Joseph, started the 

Gramophone comp any in Germany, and he 
had been helpful to 
us after the Nazis 
had started. And wh en Emile Berliner, the 
inventor died , his widow kept an ap ar -- 
had an  apartment in the hote -- in a hotel he
re, and kept the family together. It was a 
b -- a big family because they had brough
t over about 90 people from Europe and I 
was not one of them. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
50
Q: When  did those people come? 
A: Well -- 
Q: Was it early in the 1930™s? 

A: Yeah, in 1935 - 19 th ir -- see, the Nazis started in ™33, and whoever had fo resight 

-- and very  few had, actually, would get 
out, or whoever had relatives, and I met 
quite a few of these fellow relatives, but th
ey all [indecipherable] clear for me, that I 
was not one of that group.  

Q: Why? 
A: Because they were a very jealous crowd 
of each other. They are jealous of each 
other, see, and I was an outsider who had a
rrived later, after the war. And even so, I 
had arrived with the help of the -- of one 
of the Berliners. The rest were very -- 
were very nice, but distant. Only the on
es who were about my age, the young -- 
young, we were friendly to each other. 
Q: Well, you had some family help, but it 
sounds very much as if you built your 
own life here. 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. I -- I didn't
 ask. Once I had found out th
at I had to ask for a raise, 
and that without being pushed, nobody in
 America would think to increase your 
pay, and I wasn™t used to that. But I kept 
going and we had, as I say, we had a nice 
wedding, with a limited number of people
, and moved to an apartment in Maryland. 
Q: How do you -- how do you -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
51
A: After [indecipherable] moved, we lived 
in Virginia for awhile, and after Jackie 
was born, we moved to Maryland, to Ka
ywood Garden . Was a small apartment and 
when the second girl arrived, we had a -- 
we got a bigger apartment. And we stayed 
quite a few years in Kaywood. From there al
so I took the bus into
 town to my work. 
Q: I wanted to ask -- 
A: Yeah? 
Q: -- and interrupt to ask, you 
had done all that traveling -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- which you did out of 
necessity, Greece, Cyprus -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
Q: -- Dar Es Salaam. 

A: Yes [indecipherable] 
Q: But how do you look back  
on those early years of ma rriage? It sounds as if your 
wedding was very joyful, and th at mu st have
 been a very happy stage in your life. 
A: Well that, yes, it was, with exception of 
the strained relations to my parents.  
Q: But did that -- 
A: But that -- 

Q: -- did that feel -- 

A: -- we had a good -- pardon? 
Q: -- and -- did that relationship heal with time?

A: Oh yeah. Wonderf -- when 
my  parents decided to go ba
ck to Africa, because my 
sister and her husband promised
 to more or less take care of them there, things 
improved. And so later on there were times
 when  we had to su
pport not only my 
parents, but also my  mother-in-law. And 
living in  Kaywood was not very luxurious, 
but the ch ildren had decent 
schools. Did they have sc
hools? Yeah. And we made 
ends meet and actually enjoyed life as we
ll as we could. We joined the Jewish 
community there, and they -- th
ey fa -- more or less fish ed
 me out to beco me active, 
first as a secretary of a men™s club, then as
 president of the men™s club, and th en as 
president of the congregati
on 1959 and ™60. During th
at time this group built a 
synagogue and sold  the synagogue becaus
e p-people moved in other directions. 
They  built a second synagogue and I stayed 
member th ere, now about 55 years that 
I™ve been a member of that co
ngregation. But we have to  
go back to the start. There 
came one day wh en I asked for a raise, and 
they just said, well, sell insurance, 
you™ll make commissions. And I went 
back  -- no, I had met a man who was 
working for the Group Health association in
 their office, and he
 needed -- he was 
working as chief accountant for Group Hea
lth association, which was starting at 
that time in  downtown Wash
ington, and he had an open
ing. But they
 -- the only 
way I could get in there was through an  
employment agency. I 
went back to th e 
agency I knew, and through 
them got an appointment to
 Group Health, and I told  
my  employer s-sorry, I can make mo re money there, and I did. Bu t I kept my

insurance business, which was tiny, w
ith the pe -- the people who had been 
work ing, and kept in touch with  it, so th
at way I worked for 
-- as assistant chief 
accountant for Group Health
, for a little bit over a yea r. Was interesting work 
because we had -- I -- I found that the phys
icians had to be idealists, who started 
Group Health. I saw it from the paycheck s, 
which were -- which I had to make out. 
And on the other hand, the treasurer was a 
man from Trinidad  who, after seeing my  
history, for months wouldn™t talk to 
me, because I had been heading a black 
work force, and he was black
. But eventually he got 
over it and we got quite 
friendly. He is -- became a CPA in Arlin
gton afterwards. After about one year, the 
accountant for Wolfe and Cohe
n, the Insurance 
agency where I ha
d been, called me 
and asked why I had left. I told him, it™s ju
st a matter of fina
nces, and th at I had 
been married, and --

caust Memorial Museum interview with 
Frederick Wohl. This is ta
pe number three, side B. 
A: He asked me to come to his office, th
e accountant of the 
insurance agency, and 
we were talking. I had been friendly with
 him while I was working th ere, and he 

asked me under what conditions I would go
 back there. I was surprised, even 
though I™d kept friendly with 
th e owners, I had been to  th
eir offices to attend to my 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
54
insurance business every now 
and then. I asked for a quite healthy salary and for 
time to build up my own busin
ess, and to my surprise, they accepted it. And I went 
back, and I had some good years there. I 
learned more about th
e insurance business 
and I got registered as ag
ent in Maryland, which was 
an interesting experience, 
because the person who ti -- w
ho supervised the examinati
on in Baltimore had what 
you would call an open hand, an d was disa
ppointed wh en I just shook his hand 
when I left. But I got my Maryland license
, and worked pretty hard. We lived in 
Kaywood, on th e lookout fo r even tually finding a house. And I had during that time 
been in contact with an 
attorney who took care of
 claims to the German 
government. This is -- this was of great he
lp to me because the first payment I got 
for them was used when -- to seriously  
look after a house. A
nd we lived from, I 
guess it mu st have been  ™42 - ™43 - ™53,
 in Silver Spring 
[indecipherable]  
Q: Mr. Wohl, tell me what it would have
 been  for. Would it 
have been for your 
pharmacy business, the reparations? 
A: No, that reparations had 
only to do with me personally.
 It was my interruption of 
studies, it was my unable to be -- to fi
nd work, and it was afterwards a kind of 
German Social Security. The -- ma-many 
refugees got payment from Germany, and 
nobody would talk about it tilit was an actual fact, beca
use there was the mentality 
that if I tell somebody else and he does 
the same kind of app
lication that I have 
done, maybe it would in fluence my a-app
lication. But I found out that I did no 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
55
worse and no better than other refugees, an
d I got a -- a rent from age -- I think it 
was age 65, from Germany, whic
h helped us quite a bit. 
Q: And what -- what percentage of refuge
es do you think received this support? 
A: Whoever could get it an-a
nd found the right channels. 
You see, I -- I happened to 
get to a -- through some people i-in the Stat
es, through an attorn
ey in Frankfurt who 
was pretty active in that, and who afterwar
ds received the first 
nine months ofmy  
pension, wh ich was his contract. And I didn™
t mind. I was an optimist. I thought, I™ll 
live longer than all these people, and I™m 
s -- I™m still surprised 
that this actually 
happened .  
Q: As a f -- as parents, 
did you think it was important 
to give your daughters any 
kind of religious upbringing? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Did you go to -- oh, tell me. 
A: You see, we belonged to the -- in M
ount Rainier to the co
ngregation. My  wife 
was that religious and I got that way, too,  th at we attended Friday  night services, 
and sometimes Saturday. We went to the high 
holidays, and as I said
 I took office in 
the congregation, and enjoyed it. I was not 
very knowledgeable in reli gious things, 
but I had the help of our first permanent 
rabbi -- oh no, the second permanent rabbi, 
who was brought in from Europe. He was fro
m Vienna and he had been a rabbi for 
the British army in Frankfurt before they 
brou -- took him here
. He and his wife 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
56
were very great friends, and I was the one 
who had to interview this rabbi for his 
job, and we stayed friends even after he 
had left Washington, and he was kind of a 
father figure for me. R abbi Weinberg. 
Q: Did you observe -- did you -- a
ny dietary rules in your home -- 

A: No -- 
Q: -- o-or would it just be going to  -- 
A: -- on the high holidays. My wife family
 had kept a kosher home, so we started 
out with that in mind, but 
we are quite liberal by now. 
Q: And what about your
 daughters, in turn? 
A: My daughters went to relig -- to the re
ligious school, and to th e congregation and 
were confirmed, and they have mu ch mo re 
religion than I ever had. Jackie and her 
family, even though her husband is not 
Jewish, b-belong to a congregation in  
Arizona, in Tucson, wh ere on th e high holiday
s, she usually plays the violin  at the 
services. And my  younger daug
hter, also re -- at l -- go
es at least to high holiday 
services. B u t they know wh
ere they come from and wher
e they belong, to a much 
greater extent than I did. And my  late wi
fe would have been very happy to see how 
her grandchildren got a real Jewish upb
ringing. They ma -- Jackie has two 
daughters, my  other daughter is
 alone. Well, where were we? 
A: Well, how was it that both of
 them have settled in Arizona? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
57
Q: Well, Jackie got friendly with a youn
g man even tually, who was work ing in a 
government committee in Washington and 
who came from Phoe
nix. They decided 
to get married and mo ved to 
Tucson, wh ere he went back  to university. And Jackie 
got her law degree here from the American 
Univ ersity, and she passed the necessary 
examinations in Arizona, and that wa
s it. Why my younger daughter, for her 
practical year in the medical study, went to
 where her sister lived, and stayed  there 
afterwards. Fortunately they are frie
ndly with each other, 
and my younger -- 
younger daughter enjoys her 
nieces, which is good. So th
ey are both on their own, 
and after end of their studies, did not need
 an y support from us. So we could live a 
little bit more comfortable. And we had th
e nice circle of friends from the old -- 
friends from the po -- poker round. There 
are only tw o brothers left -- no, two 
brothers and one mo re, yeah, there are thre
e of the-them left with whom I am in 
contact, and the one on whos
e wedding we got enga
ged, is still a very dear friend, 
even with  my second wife. My business 
went all right til it got too big fo r the 
agency I was working 
with, and they were unhappy. 
I had an assistant in their 
accounting department and no
w automation came in and 
I helped them to get 
automated to some extent, and they -- we
 had long discussions about computers, 
because it was too -- too difficult and while I 
was on my first visit to my parents in 
Germany, they decided on a computer sy
stem. When I came, I naturally had to 
agree with it, and [indecipherable] it to some extent, so that I could live, that I could 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
58
continue. Bu t they th en refused to give me
 help in the work, 
because the computers 
did the work , and as a result, I didn™t 
have enough time for my  own insurance 
busin ess, and I had to consider
 leaving. I left and went 
with a life insurance agency 
who looked to it that I got a decent up -- 
decent education in life insurance, which 
was important to me, it was important for them because it -- life insurance company 
then paid part of my salary
, for the first couple of year
s. I, from then 
on, put more 
emphasis in life insurance, which was difficu lt for me, cause I did not have the right 
connections, and eventually
 only -- only so ld life in
surance. But I kept -- 
Q: Mm-hm. What do you mean you didn™t 
have the right connections? Other people 
would come to the business with 
some [indecipherable] connection -- 

A: I si -- I see where big companies have 
their insurance agents
 who not only do 
their life in surance nowadays, 
but also take care of -- in -- advise on investme nts, 
which I tried to do at one time, but that y
ear the stock market went down  and I gave 
up on that type of advice. 
Q: You chose the wrong time. 
A: Yeah. I see today from my stepson, wh
o is in the life insurance business, how 
the agents go on -- go afte
r big accounts, not small homeown ers. The homeowners 
have to look out for themse
lves to find an agent, unle
ss somebody just
 happens to 
call them. And that helped me, to a certain 
extent, that couple of attorneys who were 
in the real estate settlement business, 
would call me whenever
 somebody bought a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
59
house and did not bring an 
insu rance connection to the 
settlement. They would pick 
up th e phone and give me the name and addr
ess, and say oh, I had a customer. That 
were -- they were very good friends a
nd without them I woul
d not have made a 
success the way I did. Naturally, after selli
ng these people their fire insurance for 
their new home, I would at least try to se
ll them life insurance also, to cover their 
mo rtgage, or automobile insurance, or wh
atev er. And I had over 
400 accounts, and I 
had my own little office in Silver Spring,
 which also has a story because after 
leaving Wolfe and Co hen, I went to that
 life agency, and doing their accounts, I 
found that they were draw
ing too mu ch money from the busin ess, and I had warned 
them, but they continued. And after three ye
ars, I think, they we
re unable to keep 
me because they didn™t have money for my 
salary, and I had to look around what to 
do. One of the lawyers with 
wh om I was friendly, had to 
have an office in Silver 
Spring, because for settlement
s in Montgomery county, ther
e had to be an office in 
Silver Spring. So he -- he and an  associat
e had rented an office in the Perpetual 
Building, wh ich was very seldom used. Th
ey  would co me there 
for an hour for a 
settlement and then -- otherwise that place 
was empty, and I got it, as a helper, I 
paid -- I -- I worked there, fi
rst wit h out paying a penny re
nt, or t -- even telephone. 
It cost -- it was no additional charge for 
them, but afterwards I insisted, and my 
busin ess grew that I had to take a part 
time h elp, and when that was -- when it was 
too much for this, I associ
ated with an ag
en cy  in Wash ington, who were well 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
60
known, and where I had a contract for 10 
years, which was sat isfact o ry, but the 
owner of that agency was not a very stable
 character, as I found out after years, and 
in my -- at the end of the eighth year of my
 contract, he went out of business, and I 
had to take my accounts somewhere else. I as
sociated with anothe
r agency in Silver 
spr -- no, here in Rockville, and got a three 
year contract. I was older at that time, 
and I didn™t think any further. After thre
e years, they took my general insurance 
business over, and I was left with the life 
insurance alone, which was fine with me. 
And I worked til the beginning of ninet -- of
 2003, in the later 
years from home. In 
two -- wh en my  wife got sick in April 20
03, I stopped, and that was the end of my  
professional life.  
Q: You know, I™d like to have you comment 
-- and I don™t know what your thoughts 
are, but on the impact you 
think th ere was on your life and thinking of your wartime 
experiences. Obviously there was a 
profound impact on career, and -- 
A: My -- my first wife actually was not too 
much interested in it.
 She was interested 
in the children™s education. She realized 
I had to go out in the evenings, visiting 
customers. And thank God she made a good 
job of the education 
of my  daughters. 
We got along well, naturally had our little 
differences now and th en, but we were 
married for 42 years. She becam
e sick, she had to go on di
alysis for two and a half 
years, and died, unexpected
, but naturally on dial -- di
alysis people -- you have -- 
you have to expect something. Bu t two a
nd a half years was not expected. There are 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
61
people wh o are on dialysis mu ch longer. It was a sad time, because i -- the two of 
us, after the daughters were married, had 
been able to trav -- do quite a bit of 
traveling, and even when sh
e was on dialysis, we traveled
 to Germany, we traveled 
to Bermuda, we traveled to Aruba, where 
she could get treatment. You had to  make 
arrangements for the treatment, but we enjoye
d life as well as we could, and we had 
a lot of pleasure, actually, from our daughter
s, whom we visited at least once a year, 
right?  

Q: Did you get invo
lved in politics?  
A: From the beginning of living in the Ka
ywood Garden in Moun
t Rainier, I joined 
the democratic party, which helped me in 
business, and I became in Silver Spring, 

precinct chairman and did as much or as littl
e as I could for -- i-in party work, but at 

least I was connected, and met 
people. I kept busy with th at, and with the congrega 
-- the Jewish congreg ation and with B™nai 
B™rith, and especially with the Masonic 
Lodge. My father had helped
 me to get into the lodge 
here in Washington and I™ve 
been there now 55 y
ears, at least.  
Q: With -- with Freemasons, what are the -- 
are there people of every religious faith 
there?  

A: The Masonic Lodge is open to everybo
dy who has some kind of
 religion, but the 
Catholic church is unfriendly, let™s say. There were Catholics in there. There are 
lodge -- lodges -- by now, I be
lo ng to two Masonic Lodges, one in the district and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
62
one in Maryland. And there are lodges wh
o are [indecipherable] Jewish, but in 
general anybody who is accepted, and yo
u have to go through ritual and 
examinations, is accep table. 
Q: Mm-hm. My question about politics was 
really -- I was wondering whether you 
felt that there was a lin k between your wish 
to  be involved and your experience in 
Nazi Germany. 

A: I -- I remember having a written -- a littl
e article in Germany that was published 
in a [indecipherable] as a -- a letter from -- 
w h ere I told them that oh, Nazis may be 
big in the cities, but the general popula
tion was quite democratic. Naturally I was 
wrong, but I remember that. And I wasn
™t active politically in Germany, no, 
because before leaving, I was part of a Jewi
sh sports club in Frankfurt for the few d 
-- short time I was in Frankfurt, but that was about all. The --

is an interview with Frederick Wohl, condu

th
, 2004, in Bethesda, Maryland. This inte
rview is part of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum™s
 post-Holocaust interview

Frederick Wohl on 
November the 22

locaust Memorial Museum 
gratefully acknowledges Jeff
 and Toby Herr for making 
this interview possible. 
This is tape number four, side A. 
A: What do you mean, family history? 
We -- we lived a -- a pretty quiet life. 
[indecipherable] after we had moved to Silv
er Spring, where one 
of the aims was to 
give the children the best possible schools,
 and to live in a ne
ighborhood wh
ere they 
could make friends, which was successful. Th
ere naturally was always the fact that 
I had to go and visit customers 
an d my wife was left to e
ducate the children, or to -- 
to direct their lives. T h ere are many things
 that happened in my  professional career 
that might be funny or interesting, but I 
don™t think they have any room here. Just 
now like the time when my mother-in-la
w was hospitalized in Wash ington, and 
walking outside her room I met a man wh
om I knew, an d who was there after a 
slight heart attack, and who wanted to buy
 some life insurance. Immediately I had 
to explain to him that that wasn™t quite th
e way to do it. Or the adventures we had 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077
 
 
 
 
64
with automobiles. Our first 
car was a Nash that we bought from a man who work ed 
in the NIH, and it was all right. At that 
time you had to  have your car inspected 
every six months in Virginia, and after m
oving to Mary land, th
ey were maryli -- 
more liberal in that respect. The man wh
o sold her the car was sitting in a coffee 
shop in Athens when  we visited Greece 
some time later -- later. Which was a 
surprise. You meet people all over the place,
 and you have to be
 pretty careful. 
Others -- things -- the accident I had or avoided on Jackie™s 16
th
 birthday, going out 
to buy -- to buy a birthday cake and also
 to pick up my yo
unger daughter from 
mu sic school, we had an accident with a small Citroen car that I had bought some 
months earlier and that suddenly  lost brak
es. Fortunately, we could stop by running 
into the car in front, and nobody got hu
rt. But the interesting thing was the 
policeman who came, first thing he did, he
 wanted to smell my breath. And well, 
that car had had it, at that time. W e la
ter on got a second car -- [crashing sound] 
Q: Oh, Evelyn, Evelyn! [tape break]. At 
this point, Mrs. Evel
yn Wohl tripped and 
fell over in an adjoining room. We theref
ore, somewhat abruptly, concluded the
