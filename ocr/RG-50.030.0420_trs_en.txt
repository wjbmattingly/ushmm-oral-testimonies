KING MICHAEL I of ROMANIA 
 November 12, 2001 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Your Majesty, I would like to tha
nk you for agreeing to share with us your 
recollections of a very complicat
ed period in your life, and criti
cal period in Romanian history. 
Before we begin, for the camera, could you pleas
e tell us your name , when you were born and 
where you were born? 
Answer: Now, this thing of the name  is some thing which is very confusing to very ma ny people. 

My name  is Michael, as you know, but this -- I 
don™t want to ma ke t
oo many explanations, but 
anyhow just tell you how things are. Of c
ourse, our fa mily come s from Germany from 
Sigmaringen, become  the first -- the first ki
ng of Roma nia was a Hohenzollern, like my 
grandfather. But that ended with my grandfather.
 So we, in fact, do not have a family name  in 
Roma nia. The fa mily name  of Hohe nzollern is
 the origin, but that 
does not figure in any 
document or [indecipherable]. So that™s why I said
 it™s a bit confusing. So, 
the result is that we 
are called by our name  and then add, of Roma nia . So that™s how things are now. I was born on 

the 25
th
 of October, 1921, in Sinaia in a house wh
ich unfortunately doesn™t exist any mo re 
because the o-original one burnt down, and it was 
rebuilt in 1954 - ™56, the m
odern one. So that™s 
about all for the introduction. 

Q: Thank you, thank you. Your ma jesty, King Ca
rol returned to Roma nia in 1930. You were 
nine years old. As I understand it, 
he took charge of your educati
on and upbringing at that time . 
Can you talk with us about your relationship with
 your father in those years, and about the 
education that he organized for you?

A: We ll, two things here. One was my personal f
eelings and personal relationship with him, and 
the second part was a j -- was about the schooling. 
My personal relationship with him, to put it 
quite frankly, was not all the very best. I don™t 
know how ma ny people in 
United States and other 
countries are quite aware of what 
went on at that period. I don™t wa
nt to say too strongly, but his 
private life is the one that 
-- that other people know more a
bout. As you know, probably, that he 
had a connection with a certain pe
rson. As far as I could recollect 
what I was told, that started 
when I was about two years old. An
d in the 20™s he left Romania 
and renounced his rights to the 
fa mily and to the throne and to everything concer
ning Roma nia. So then when he came  back in 
1930, with a promise that this person was not going 
to come  back with him. He finally did bring 
it back. So this situation got, we
ll let™s say practically out of ha
nd. Because of this, my  mother 
had to leave the country. So she left for good in 
1932. So he had been away in the 20™s, and my 
mother looked after me  and gave me  -- this 
is the way we [indeciphe
rable] in Roma nia, you 
know, the first seven years at home. And that™s so
me thing that norma lly rema ins with one for the 
rest of your life. And the life afte
r, when my father came was so totally different that it just was 
very, very diffi cult for me to really take it. Well,
 that™s one part, but th
e part of my education 
where I must say I was thankful to him because he
 had an idea, which is certainly very well. He 

ma de a special school for me  inside the pala
ce grounds, but in the [indecipherable] and we 
started with 12 boys in this school, each one of th
em from another part of the country, and from 
completely different social standings. From sons
 of si mple peasants ri
ght up to sons of some  
industrialists, or inte
llectuals. So that helped me  to, say to 
rub shoulders with a very good part of 
the Roma nian people, even if at our age. And theteachers that we had were selected of some  of 

the best run schools, especially one school. And th
en at the end of every school year, for about 

three weeks, we took off in a trai
n, a special train with everybody in
 it, the professors and all of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
3 
 
 
us, in a different part of the country, we -- we
ll, we took our lessons 
and courses in geography 
and histor y on the actual place where these things
 ac -- ha ppened. So that is how I got to know 
my country, as much as possible, 
every little corner. I mean not 
every, it™s very difficult, but a 
lot. We ll, that has served
 me all thro
ugh my life. 
Q: You have just described a difficult relati
onship with King Carol. As you grew up in those 
years, did he talk with you and 
share his views about the political
 developments in Roma nia that 
he was confronting? 
A: I forgot again. I forgot to me ntion 
one thing, that although my mother was gone, 
[indecipherable] with some thing was rather painfu
l for me  be cause he only let me  go to see her 
twice a year for three weeks in Florence, because
 she went to Florence. You know, she loved art 
so much, she f-found a villa there from 1932 and bought 
this place, and that™s where I used to go 
and see her. And I can say that
 those six months in -- those 
few mon -- not few months, few 
weeks, I™m sorry, few weeks at the time, I coul
d say that that really charged my batteries, 
because ot he rwise it would have been reall
y, if I can use the expression, absolute hell, 
some ti me s. Now as far his political life and that
, again, I don™t think ma
ny people understand the 
situation at the time. I was never, at least not 
from hi m ever told what was going on. We learned 
a certain amount of political systems in school, but 
that was very dry, not in practice. So in all 

these events that f-finally led up to 1940 when he
 had to leave, I knew about them, of c ourse, as 
a side line. But I had to try a
nd find out by myse lf from various 
people, but I never got anything 
from hi m, fr om my father. And that was a terrib
le handicap when he left
, because I was suddenly 
-- found my self in a position withou
t actually knowing all the details. 
I knew a lot of things that 
were going on, but not all the de
tails on how everything worked. 
And that ma de life really 
di ffi cul t .

Q: How did you find out what was going on? 
A: What? 

Q: How did you find out 
what was happening?   
A: We ll, of course, I could see the newspapers and some other people -- and some of the boys 

used to tell me  things that I always expected my 
father to say. So that™s the -- that is a very 
sketchy thing and it™s not the 
real basics of what was going 
on. That I didn™t find out except 
much, much later. 

Q: Can you describe your reaction if -- if you were aware of the significance of this, of the rise of 

Hitler to power in Germany? 

A: We ll, of course, that™s -- 
everybody knew, I knew, we saw in the papers, we knew what was 
happening with him, yes. We ll, I could put it then th
at in the later part  of 
the 30™s, all of Europe 
was catching fire, see, so we were unfortunate
ly in a place geographi
cally, in a very, very 
diffi cult situation fr om the east, then the pressu
res from the Germans. We had alliances before 
with [i ndecipherable] many people knew, which 
when Hitler started bullying Europe, these 
alliances fell to pieces, unfortunately. So our pa
rt of Europe was left uncovered. We  had ma ybe 

an advantage as a disadvantage be
cause we have oil, and Hitler needed oil. We  have the Danube 
[indecipherable] part of the Danube. I think heliked that part also. So the whole political 

situation was getting mo re and more complicat
ed, more and more involved. But I just found 
these things out in a [indecipherabl
e] so to speak, not the actual basi cs, not the actual mechanism 
of it. That was my difficulty.  

Q: Did you have the same  difficulty knowing what 
-- what happened in Roma nian political life at 
that time? There was a -- this 
was a period when right wing partie
s began to appear in Roma nia. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
5 
 
 
A: Yes. Of c ourse [indecipherable] these people 
that used to come , wanting audiences to my 
father, but just very rarely ot
her people, we had certain festiv
ities. I knew a lot of them. I knew 
quite a lot of what they were and what they 
were doing, but that™s about all. I had no actual 
proper contact with these people. They just sort
 of just -- you know, like a -- how shall I say, 
meet at a party, that sort of thing. But not
 in depth. Now that was very difficult. 
Q: Some  historians have said 
that some  of those right wing po
litical groups, the Iron Guard in 
particular -- 
A: Mm. 

Q: -- had great appeal to young people in this 
country. We re you aware of
 -- of their mass ap-
appeal to young people here? 

A: We ll, among the young people, yes, I have ca
ught, how do I -- shall I 
say, from their point 
[indecipherable] long, because through their parents, I suppose, a
nd themselves, they realized 
what had happened with me  and 
my mother. Now that did -- I must say it was very, very 
gratifying because whenever we me t these young people [indecipherable] the warmth was 

extraordinary. Maybe I didn™t quite understand why it was happening, 
what the reason for it was, 
but this I found out years later, because they r
ealized what it was which was happening with my 
mother. And then you mentioned the point a
bout the extreme right 
comi ng up, and that 
[indecipherable] influenced politically my fath
er. Because I must say some thing here, which I 
don™t want to be badly understood. But this person
 that was the cause of my mother™s sadness, 
she was Jewish. Not that I have any particular fee
lings about that, but I ha
ve a feeling of what -- 
because of he r, what happened with my mother
. And those extreme rights were [indecipherable] 
the Nazi fifth column, you know, were anti-Jewis
h. That, of course, conn
ected with my father, 
from his private life. Because during the 30™s 
I must also admit that Roma nia progressed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
6 
 
 
enormously, if not politically, but economi cally. 
We have our money, the leu was practically at 
the level of the dollar in the end of the 30™s.
 We  had a standard of living like France and 
Belgium. So s -- some  good did come, very mu
ch good. The trouble was the pol-political part 
that was not quite as it should have
 been. And this background of my 
father with these others is a 
complicated matter. And then of course, some 
political tendenc y, like in all parts of Europe, you 
know, we still have this -- how shall I put this, so
rt of a Byzantine influence, which is completely 

different to what we know in the west, politically
 speaking. That also didn
™t quite fit in with 
some  of my father™sideas. And 
that™s why, towards the end of the 30™s, he for med a sort of a 
[indecipherable] we like to call it, which was not
 quite the thing to do, 
because when the real 
trouble started, we didn™t have the old political pa
rties to lean on. And th
en you got the situation 
that the extreme right started agit
ating out in the streets. Very 
complicated situation and he fell 
into that. Now, these are all 
things that I -- not studied, 
I™ll say, but I found out ma ny more 
details many years after. But at the time we we
re all very worried and I could not ma ke out 
exactly what was going on in detail, because I wasn
™t told. I had to try and pick it up here and 
there. That™s very much in a nutshell. 

Q: What was your father™s view about Jews in 
Roma nia?  Wha t  were his feelings, his personal 
feelings and his political feelings? 

A: About me personally? 

Q: Abo -- about Jew -- Jewish people. 

A: Oh. We ll, he never talked about them. Not a wo
rd. That is also some thing pretty extraordinary 

because we knew what was going on with Hitler and 
so on, but he never said a word to me . So I 
can™t really say what he actually
 felt about that. I™m sorry, that
 -- just one of those things I 
couldn™t -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
7 
 
 
Q: An-and what did he think about the Iron Guard? 
A: Well, that  -- 

Q: Did he -- did he speak about that? 

A: We ll, the Iron Guard you mean? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah, well that, of course, I could feel it more
 than hear it, to understand that he was, of 
course, not at all for that. He di
dn™t wa nt that at all. They were attacking him because of this 
person. And there were certain things that went
 on of course, which we also found out much 
later. Like the execution of th
ese whole group of Iron Guard people.
 I still can™t ma ke out exactly 
if he approved this or if he
 instigated this, or it wa s done 
by some  of the governme nt people 
without him knowing [indecipherable] that I really
 cannot say, because I was not told. And even 
today I™m not very clear [indecipherable] 

Q: That execution of the group of Iron Guard pe
ople, including Corneliu Codreanu hims elf, took 
place as your father was returning from a visit 
to Germany. This was actually a vi sit that you 
began -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- with him -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- in London. Could you talk about that trip -- 

A: Mm. 

Q: -- to -- to, I believe Ge rmany and France a
nd the United Kingdom and what your goals were 

and what the results were. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420

A: Well, that  again come s into the same comple
x with me, because I was there offi cially with 
him, of course, in London, Paris, and then we
 went to [indecipherable]. But what was going on 
underneath, the discussions he had around th
ese places, I never knew a thing. It seems 
inconceivable, this thing, in a way, but unfortuna
te that that™s how it was. I just know that the 
English visit -- you know, the English royal fam
ily, and ma ny of the English people, did not 
appreciate my father at all becau
se of his private life. So, the o
fficial part, of course, had to go 
along as it normally goes, but couldn™t exactly feel hostility, but you felt some thing that was not 
quite the same  as another place,
 you know. In France that wa s diffe
rent and of course when we 
ended up in [indecipherable], of course I knew 
what Hitler wa s doing and I knew who he was 
and so on, but I was not involved. My father and 
him went up in the -- in the house there, and 
what happened, I don™t know. What I heard that wa
s being said, apparently, I c -- but I can™t be 
sure, but Hitler must have said some thing about
 the extremists. In what way and how, I really 
can™t tell. But whether what happened with Iron 
Guard execution was because of this, a-again, 
I™m sorry, I can™t -- 
I really don™t know. 
Q: You me t Adolf Hitler at -- on that occasion. Wa
s that the first time  you had me t him and can 
you tell us your impressions of hi m and the people around him?  

A: Well, of course I saw them all around there th
e first time I have ever been to this pl ace. But 
[indecipherable]. That was a very -- just to s
how you, there wa s a awkwar
d thing that happened 
that™s [indecipherabl e] neither here nor ther
e in this whole thing, because everybody knew my 
passion for cars and mechanics. So I happene
d to look out the window and I saw his big 
Mercedes there. So one of his ai
des, I think, was [indecipherable] 
so, are you interested in autos?  
I said well, yes. So they took me  
down and offer e d me  to go in this 
car of his, ride it up to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
9 
 
 
mountain at the little eagle™s ne
st, what you call it, it was on top 
of the [indecipherable] and we 
went down, ju-just to show you 
I was out of all this thing 
that was going on in-inside. 
Q: And your father did not reveal in his at
titude or -- or moo
d, what was happening? 
A: No [indecipherable] 
Q: In this same  trip, when you visited th
e United Kingdom -- I know because I™ve seen a 
photograph of a dinner at Guild Hall, where you 
were seated with Prime Minister Neville 
Cha mberlain. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Can you talk about him?  

A: No, I think we just talked, you know, what one 
talks at a big party lik
e that, but nothing else. 
And some  of the newspapers had some  funny jokes 
about that. They were 
wondering if I talked 
to him about fishing, because he was supposed to
 be a good fisherma n, or some thing, but not -- 
you know -- 
Q: So at this time you were not aware of or talk
ing about the Munich accords and the results of 
this for Romania. 
A: No. Not at all, unfortunately.  

Q: When did you become  a ware of th anti-Semitic 
nature of political gr
oups like the Iron Guard, 
and the League of National Christian Defense 
of -- of Achay Cuza, and -- and the National 
Christian Party that had both Goga and Cuza. 

A: We ll, there was Cuza, of course I me t hi m, but I didn™t have very much contact with him, so 

on. But all through the school year, the ™37 - ™
38 - ™39, I could feel it was -- some thing was 
boiling up. And I was again, very much aware of
 what was happening, but without knowing all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
10 
 
 
the underneath and how the mechanism was worki
ng. What was happening is -- well we were all 
very concerned. 
Q: Did you ever see the demonstrations that
 took place in the st
reet by these groups? 
A: No, no, no, we were all but closed in in this 
thing, and when we used to go out, any event or 
some thing locally, that was kept out. But, when he
 got to the [indecipherabl
e] in the beginning of 
1940, then of course I could hear them screaming 
outside, not yet. Now then -- I did find out that 
they were screaming because they wa nted all the change because of what happened with 

Codreanu and the [indecipherable] this w
hole story has ever been brought up and 
[indecipherable] getting more and more acu
te. Not yet. [indecipherable] I didn™t know. 
Q: You made reference earlier,
 your Majesty, to the political 
reorganization that your father 
ma de here in na -- in the early part of 1938.  

A: Mm. 

Q: Did he talk with you at that time  about
 what his goals were, for the Frontul Rena
terii 
Nationale, th-the Front 
of National Rebirth. 
A: Right. That was [indecipherable] in the new 
constitution we  ma de in 1938, of course we had 
to learn all about that in school. We  practically ha
d to, not quite but nearl
y, learn it by heart. My 
reaction to that was -- what sha
ll I say, sort of unknowing of the de
tails on the things brought this 
thing on, that I only found out much later. Probab
ly the dissatisfaction of my father, because 
certain politicians would not exactly follow wh
at he would like to do. A certain amount of 
friction among them. So what I ma
de out later on was that my father got fed up with this way of 
happenings. So that™s why he put them 
out and introduced this new Frontul Rena
terii, they 
called it, which was -- looked to me  like on the ba
sis of some  sort of -- not extreme right, but 
very right. You know, all un
iforms and all sorts of 
things that were not in our character. So of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
11 
 
 
course the general population did not really apprec
iate this sort of thing, but we couldn™t do 
much about it then.  
Q: He was supported -- 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
12 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: -- last year that King Carol was king, and th
e last year before you became  king was  a very 
complicated and troubled period in 
Romania. It was a year that be
gan with the murder of a prime 
mi nister, of Ar ma nd Calinescu. Do you reme mbe r  fr
om that period, the impact of that murder on 
the royal house and on your father? 

A: Well, I do reme mber something, yes. My impr
ession of the time was that this was the revenge 
of the Iron Guard for what happened with that gr
oup that was killed. That™s what we imagine. 
What happened afterwards, was a sort of a re
volt among the people™s feelings because those 
three pe ople that actually killed the prime mi ni
ster, were caught, brought to the pl ace where they 

shot him and were shot in the he
ad, and left them lying there. 
That I reme mber. So the reaction 
of the people was that no ma tter what they did, how
 much of -- th-that™s not
 the way to behave in 
a civilized country. That was the reaction. They 
even came, a lot of pe
ople -- town people, I 
think and maybe some other pl aces, and they put
 flowers on there. That I reme mber. What 
happened, we were at the time [indecipherable] we were leaving for Torchyn, because there was 
some  work being done on the -- behind the palace 
where we lived. And we 
were -- I was at lunch 
with my father when we heard the -- some 
screams on the radio, which was cut immediately. 

And then here™s the ma ster of the household, or 
the ma rshalle of the house,
 as you call it. He was 
on his way back home, he came back rushing, and came in and said -- I can tell you the word he 

said was Arma nd, which was called Ar ma nd Ca linesc
u, is dead. The reaction, I saw my father go 
white in the face [indecipherable] 
he went up in his room. So wa 
-- that™s how I -- how I saw it, I 
was there. Well, after that he called me  up to 
his room and s t arted to -- you know, he was on the 
shock, deep shock. He said a whole bunch of thin
gs that I should realize that these people are 
murderers, that any day he coul
d be shot also, that -- I don™t know
 a whole lot of other details 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
13 
 
 
which I don™t quite reme mber, but I know that he 
was -- what shall I say, he was -- he -- he was 
going to pieces, really. Well -- and af
ter that I think they must have
 talked in the [i ndecipherable] 
because I don™t know again the de tails [indecipher
able] not explain, were not told. Now that was 
the reaction, I was there, I li -- I lived with.  
Q: Did he ever recover his cont
rol of the situation after that? 
A: We ll, he was in control for quite some  tim
e. But then, you know, Europe -- Europe was going 
to pieces also. Then the -- the way the country 
had to navigate between all these things going on 
was getting more and more complicated. As I said 
before, the real political parties were -- were 
nowhere present, and he was more or less quite al
one with this new thing that they produced. So 
he was in control, of course, but the feeli
ng in the population was going down and down, so that 
was a diffi culty. This is all the things that I 
suffered -- I suffered it, I was living with it, but 
feeling it from the boys at sc
hool, and things I saw in the ne
wspaper, but not the actual 
information, properly be given to me  of how
 and what is going on. That I didn™t know. 
Q: In 1940, King Carol invited some  Iron Guard me mbers, including Horia Sima  into the 

governme nt. How can we understand that? 

A: That™s one of these things difficult to unde
rstand. You see, we got another situation which 
was rather  hu miliating for my father in a sense,
 because this General Antonescu at the time, 
which was very much against hi m because of his 
private life and because of his politics with 
these party things and so on. [ind
ecipherable] was against my father
 in certain declarations. So 
being a officer when this wi -- went down very 
badly with my father, of course and he put him 
under house ar -- sort of a house 
arrest if you can ca
ll it, in a monastery. In the monastery 
[indecipherable] and he put him awa y. Not 
-- not prison, but anyhow a semi  -- semi -fr ee 
[indecipherable]. Again, a situation 
evolving in such a way that sudde
nly he had to call him back 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
14 
 
 
to put him in some  position. See, it™s a very, ve
ry awkward situation, a
ll this. And I just saw 
these things happening, but I coul
dn™t get the undernea
th of it. I know that the Legionnaire 
[indecipherable] had been contacting Antone
scu, but without knowing what and how long -- 
what was being prepared, that I didn™t know at a
ll. I don™t want to jump too far forward, but -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- but in the beginning of the 40™s, of course
, on top of the situation 
-- internal situation and 
we got [indecipherable] from the Rus sians, a
nd then we got [indeci
pherable] for northern 
Transylvania, and then it got from 
bad to worse. Only some  t hings that sort of leaked out to me . 
First of all, the population around me  also said we
 have to do some thing, we have to have some  
reaction, and there was no reaction from that point 
of view. It was quite 
obvious that we could 
not -- our army, or anybody else could have possi
bly stopped the Russians from comi ng in, but 
one should have don™t it, at leas
t a sort of symbolic someth
ing -- resistance, you call it. I 
reme mber there was a crown council [indecipherabl
e] after the Russian [i
ndecipherable]. It was a 
-- I was not involved, but I know it was going on [i
ndecipherable] in Paris, when one of the 
leading former politicians and professor -- ma yb
e you know the name  of Yargo, the hi storian. He 
was also not very friendly with my father, but an
yhow he was there, because he was part of these 
people, so he came out of this meeting when I ha
 -- happened to be there.
 So he came straight up 
to me , I could see he was livid, in his face. And he
 just said a ve ry strong word and he said, all 
that bunch is a bunch of traitors, 
and he walked off. And I -- I di
dn™t understand what that was. 
Then after I found out that they got probably frig
htened or didn™t have backbone or whatever it 
is, I™m not quite sure, but they 
all advised that ther
e™s nothing to be done, we just have to 
comply, not to [indecipherable]. And that™s oneof the revolt of ma ny of 
the people in Romania, 
is that we should have at least done some thing. 
But that™s about how I got to know these things, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
15 
 
 
cause I was also [indecipherable] put in the sideli
ne that I was also involved because it was the 
end of my s c hooling years, just before univers
ity, and I was having my fi nal exam with four 
other boys, just about that sa
me  period. Now, I don™t know what you call it in English, in 
Roma nian or the French is the baccalaureate, a
nd sh -- all this -- you know
, you get sort of torn 
between the home  life and different things. I ha
ve to concentrate on my exams, and the same 
time these things are going on. You™re sort of -- get 
to be in a sort of a haze, you know?  So that™s 
in a nutshell also, if I could say. 
Q: In this period, the very end of your father™sreign, did he ever share 
with you the idea that he 
mi ght lose control and have to leave? 

A: No, I can™t say he di d. You know, from -- 
I had this backgr ound becau
se of my mo ther, you 
see. And he never talked to her -- about her, or 
very, very rarely. When I used to come  back from 
seeing her, he never even asked me  how she was. So no, I didn't  -- I saw some thing wasn™t 

clicking, you know, that™s -- this is
 just very, very difficult way to
 explain it, surely, but I think 
some people maybe will understand. 

Q: How did you learn that King Carol ha
d abdicated, and that you were king? 
A: We ll, this was getting on, as I said before, wh
en -- this is a little be
fore the beginning of 
September, 1914, when he called back Antonescu. He
 made a prime mi nister, I think it was at 
the time . Ac cidentally, I happened 
to be just outside my father™s office when Antonescu was in 
there. And when he came  out, he saw me  there, he 
came straight up to me  and 
just said -- he -- he 
always had this funny habit of talking in the 
third person, you know, about hims elf. A-Awkward. 
So he came up to me  and she said Ge neral Antone
scu guarantees the situation. Then he left. Now 
what did he guarantee, what was th
e situation?  I had no idea. So we 
come  to the last part of it, 
this was on the fifth of September. On or before
 that, he had another audience with Antonescu 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
16 
 
 
when Antonescu dema nded that he give up nearly al
l his prerogatives to Ant
onescu. That just left 
him with a few -- put it little bit vulgar in a wa
y, [indecipherable]. So on the fifth of September, 
we could hear shooting going on 
outside in the streets. The 
guards around the palace grounds 
were reinforced [indecipherable], I me t hi m in the garden. But all that  night we stayed awake, 
until about five o™clock in the morning, and then 
a courier came from Antonescu with a letter. It 
was given to him, he ope ned it, and as he was 
reading I could vaguely se
e his color was draining. 
And he gave this letter to this ma n that
 was the gray ma tter behind him, a ma n called 
Ludverrano, just gave it to him, so that he read it
 also, and then he said 
to my father in French, 
because he used to talk a mi xture of languages, he  said, nothing more to do. So I was, you know, 

sort of shaken out of a haze, so I just said, well, 
what™s this? So then they
 read it to me, in which 
Antonescu de ma nded his abdication because of all 
sorts of things, the political situation, this 
[indecipherable] one thing, my moth
er and so on, a whole mi xture of things, and that -- then -- 
dema nding his abdication. So that was that. That™s 
at five o™clock in the 
morning, we hadn™t slept 
all night, and funnily enough there™s 
a certain lady there, was a -- a 
-- present at this same  thing. 
What she had to do with [indecipherable] I don™t 
know, but anyhow. So I went to bed. And about 
nine o™clock in the morning, the telephone rang. 
Now one of the ladies, she said, quick, get up, 
get dressed to take the oath. Now [indecipherable]
 slept for two hours. So that™s what happened. 
I went back into the palace afte
r I sort of woke up. And there™
s Antonescu, the patriarch, the 
president of the Supreme court, and one or two ot
hers. Horia Sima  was not there. They said he 
was, but he wasn™t. So I took the oath. And as my
 father had given him all those prerogatives, he 
put under my nose [indecipherable] so ma ny people
 didn™t understand how I can, but he ma de 
me , forced me  to sign it, that Roma nia became a -- a na tiona l legi onnaire state. You probably 

don™t remember all that stuff. Well, this was, 
again, because of my non-infor mation of what had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
17 
 
 
been going on. I did not quite understand what was 
going on really. So this situation was -- was 
again, kept quite out of [indecipherable]. Now one 
thing I must say that I 
was extremely grateful 
to Antonescu in all this unpleasantn
ess that he did bring my mother back. And I consider this one 
thing, that if it wouldn™t have b
een for her all those aw
ful years, I don™t know what I would have 
done, cause she -- she kept me  going, in a way. 
Q: Right. 

A: And bringing back all those years when I was 
quite small, and so [indecipherable]. So that™s 
the situation I found, and how I f-
found myself involved in it. 
Q: And wha t  was the tone of Antonesc
u toward you as king in this period? 
A: He was a terribly stubborn ma n, you know, and ve
ry foolishly he had this idea which -- like 
with -- I discovered it. You know, th
e -- the French saying says, [ind
ecipherable] father, so is the 
son. [indecipherable] père, [indecipherable] fils. 
So he probably had this stupid idea that I was 
rather influenced, or that I was going to follow in
 my life like my father. So he kept me away. He 
certainly was not particul arly friendly with me , no, 
because of this mentality of his. So, all this 
attitude of his went on til 1944. He was cold, co
rrect if you like, which he was. But personally 
[indecipherable] around it, you can feel
 these sort of things, it was 
cold. He had great respect for 
my mother, that he did. She ma naged to put certai
n things through with him,
 but that™s about all. 
Q: The National Legionary State -- 

A: Mm. 

Q: -- for historians, meant for Romania move to
wa rds alliance with Germ
a ny, and action against 
the Jews, and -- 

A: Well. We ll, yes -- 

Q: Can y -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
18 
 
 
A: -- well -- 
Q: -- can you speak about this? 

A: -- that situation with the Legionnaires, they 
didn™t last very long. I 
don™t know why -- perhaps 
Antonescu used them or they used him or some thi
ng to get my father off, but it™s very possible. 
But then was the famous  rebellion, 
they called it. He put and end to
 that in [indecipherable] with 
a -- I think, the permission of Hitler so mehow, be cau
se they were his men, after all. But that was 
all. And from that, of course, there was an -- a 
verbal alliance with ro
 -- Germany. There was 
nothing written, as far as I know, and that™s how he 
got us in in a sort of partnership with Nazi 
Germany, which was not at all in 
the feelings and mentality of th
e Roma nian people, neither that 
right, neither at left, ne
ither. We  never had these sort of 
me ntalities, but he, having all the 
prerogatives, he did what he want [indecipherable]. 

Q: During the Iron Guard rebellion, to which you 
referred, there was terrible violence against 
Jews in Bucharest and some in
 other parts of the country.  
A: Mm.  

Q: We re you aware of what was happe
ning in the street toward Jews? 
A: We found that out a bit, 
let™s say, a few days after. 
I know -- that I know very well 
[indecipherable] things that happe
ned there, but I must have some
thing else, it is not with -- not 
just the Jews, there were ma ny 
of our  own Roma nian intellectu
als, historians, professors, 
mi nisters, they were also in the same  thing, they were also murder
ed together with
 all the others. 
But that™s, of course [indecipherable] discusse
d in the feelings of 
the population, but they 
couldn™t do anything, they -- we --
 we all had our hands tied because of Antonescu. And I don™t 

know if he ma naged to stop this, what was 
happening with the Je
ws, or did he just 
[indecipherable] it out by its
elf, I™m not quite sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
19 
 
 
Q: Did he talk with you at any ti
me  about policy toward the Jews? 
A: No, he kept pretty [indecipherable] my 
father because this thing of the Russian 
[indecipherable], that they shouldn™
t get anything, that they were
 all [indecipherable] the same  
old stories comi ng over and ove
r again, you know, but nothing else
. You ma y [indecipherable] 
already, and ma ny other people that
 when the war was declared on Russia, my mother heard it on 
the BBC on the radio. And that same  morning we
 went [indecipherable]
 I called up his deputy 
[indecipherable] the small Antonescu we called 
him, and I said, what
™s going on?  We  are 
[indecipherable] nobody tells me . 
He said, well, I thought you we
re going to see it in the 
newspapers. So you can see the kind of atmosphe
re that was going on. 
They declare -- my 
country declaring war against the 
Russians, and I™m not even tol
d. And I must find it out in the 
newspaper, you know. Y-Y-You sort of
 rema in speechless [indecipherabl e] 
Q: We re there people on whom you could count 
to share information with you about what was 
happening? 
A: We ll, this is also something. First of all,
 I inherited a number of people from my father. 
Others Antonescu put out imme diately and replac
ed them with his people [indecipherable] and 
my people run the court. So, you know, you felt you
™re cornered, spied on,
 you couldn't actually 
open your heart to these people and 
try and discuss properly -- but of
 course the -- the officers 
around me  came with all sorts of information 
[indecipherable]. We  kne
w what was going on, but 
without any possibility of doing a
nything or even saying anything.  
Q: When the war began, there was a simultaneous 
increase in violence against Jews in -- in 
Roma nia. C -- do you recall the -- the ev
ents surrounding the 
-- the pogrom in Ia
i -- 
A: Mm. 
Q: -- and how -- how you understood that at
 -- in the -- in j -- June of 1941. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
20 
 
 
A: We ll, we had informa tion, yeah I did have 
information what was going on, then we had the 
chief rabbi, which I me ntioned before, 
afran, as a young ma n at the time. He ma naged, 
some how he came and saw me  quite often, a
nd saw my mother, and he was giving us 
information. But in the very, very early stages of 
this, we could not even ma n -- ma na ge to talk a 
word of all this, Antonescu wouldn™t even liste
n. But slowly, slowly durin
g the war, with more 
and more information comi ng from 
afran. My mother did there ma nage some how, I don™t 
understand how, but she ma naged some how to ge
t Antonescu, get some  reason in him. And 
although these things did happen, we
 can™t -- I me an, be honest about
 it, it did. I can say that no 
Jews in Roma nia was ever sent to a concentr
ation camp in Germany or Poland, no th -- no. They 
did send them into Transnistria, quite a num
ber of them. But ma ybe you a l so know that 
Eichma nn was running around in Roma nia also. Now that was the information we got on the sly, 

that he was trying to get Antone
scu to do the final -- what you ca
ll it the final pogrom,  and -- but 
he refused. He let other [indeciphe
rable] things did happen, but not this real bad one, as far as I 
can know -- I -- as far as [indeci
pherable] afterward. Not only th
at, but he allowed that my 
mother should send a few train wagons into Transn
istria with clothes and food for the Jews that 
were there, [indecipherable]. And it -- it did work
 to a certain degree. A
nd because of that -- you 
probably know that also, that my mot her™s pos
ition was getting rather dangerous, from the 
German poi nt of view, because of this.  

Q: Could you speak mor e  about that? 

A: We ll, the idea that I could understand [i
ndecipherable] you™re talking about ma ny, ma ny 
evenings about all these things,she was completely distressed a
bout it. And as I knew her, if 
another question that there were Jews, that there 
were Romanians, that they were this, or they 
were, whatever it was, they were huma n beings
 like us. [indecipherable]. From a Christian point 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
21 
 
 
of view and a moral point of vi
ew, these are unconceivabl e things. 
And that is why she tried her 
best to get Antonescu to get some thing through hi
s head that this is 
not some thing that is 
possible. It™s -- she even told me
 once that if -- I co-can™t also
 say some thing and try and alter 
this, I™ll be known as Michael the Bad. Sh -- I do
n™t know if she meant it like that, or there -- 
some thing, but anyhow. We ll, I do reme mber we 
had one or two meals with Antonescu, and 
even the German mi nister [indecipherable]. And 
I tried to say some thing, and my mother said 
quite more. The atmosphere was glacial. But 
some how something did ge
t through to Antonescu 
and he didn™t do the worst that could have been done, as far as I know. 
Q: Did you have similar conversations with Mihai Antonescu? 

A: Yes, we did also. And he was mu ch more -- 
how shall I say, more softened on this thing. He 

tried several times to take my part in some  of
 these problems with Antonescu. Maybe that also 
helped. That even my mother, let™s say [indeci
pherable] backbone [indecipherable] fight to try 
and get some  sense in [indecipherabl e] stop as 
much as possible, what was going on. Because we 
also in Romania, the mo ment the war star ted, what was left  of the political  parties, the national 

[indecipherable] laborers and myself and the whol
e population of Roma ni a, we fully agreed that 
we have to get back the [indecipherable]. No, 
no problem there. No pe -- all [indecipherable] 
what not -- one step of our front, yeah. With the re
sult that we ended up in
 Stalingrad. And that™s 
how it happened. But I -- I want to say about th
at that the Roma nian people are not the kind who 
want to go around and do these sort of things. It™s
 not in their character.
 Whether they like the 
Jews or not like them, that™s besi
de the point. The fact is that they
 -- it™s not in the character of 
Romania, at least at that time. 
[indecipherable]. And that was, in
 a way we had the moral backing 
from the feelings in Roma nia about this thing, th
at™s perhaps why my moth
er had a little more 
courage to fight it out, and I too. I mean, we trie
d to do what we could, and it™s very much thanks 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
22 
 
 
to the Rabbi 
afran, that used to come  fairly often and 
tell us what was happening and as far as 
he could ma ke out, what was going to happen. So we
 did ma nage perhaps because of this, to say 
certain things before something did happen. It™s possible. 
Q: We re you aware that -- 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
23 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Your ma jesty, again, talking about the autu
mn of 1941, were you aware that Antonescu had 
ordered the deportation to Transnis
tria of all of the Jews of 
Bessarabia and northern Buchovina, 
and the conditions in which these 
deportations were taking place? 
A: Well that part is something which was not very pleasant, because there are -- we had infor -- I 
had informa tion, like everybody else, through the ar
my, that w-when the Russians came  in and 

invaded -- you know that that part of northeastern
 Roma nia, there were qu
ite a lot of Jews living 
up there. Now, by all me ans, not all at all, because  ma ny had run out, but there were quite a few, 

unfortunately, that collaborated 
with the Soviets and some  rath
er unpleasant things did happen 
there also, that™s quite true. Whet
her they were brought in by theRussians or they were actually 
ones that were there, I™m not very sure, but some
thing did happen there. Not that that changed 

the -- the me ntality in Roma nia, no. It was just
 [indecipherable] about 
that, that™s all.  
Q: And whe n the Roma nian army occupied Odessa -- 
A: Mm. 
Q: -- there was an incident invo
lving Roma nian -- the Roma nian comma nd center, and in reprisal 
the army executed twent -- 25,000 local Jews, Ukrain
ian Jews from Odess a . Did this news come  
to Roma nia? Wa s there general awareness?  We
re you and the Queen mother aware of this? 
A: Those are things we found o -- 
out of course after it happene
d. You know, that™s after, I don™t 
reme mber who it was exactly, blew up some  hea dqua
rters, I think, yeah. Now, which part of the 
army did some  of those things there, I™m not quite  sure where the order ca
me from, but I think it 
was the general sort of thing given to the 
army. But I do know that there was one general 
commanding around there that proteste
d violently, and as far as I reme mber he was put out and 
moved some where else. So there was some  react
ion, that I know. But we found it out probably 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
24 
 
 
say a week, 10 days after th -- all that happene
d, yes. Now we -- we were all very unhappy about 
this. But a -- but Antonescu never said a word to
 me  on that. Again, all of these things were -- I 
was kept in the dark. 
Q: You visited the military front on so me  occasion. Did you witness the conditions in 

Transnistria itsel f, in which people we re li
ving under -- under Roma
nian admi nistration? 
A: That the people -- 

Q: That -- in which people were living. 

A: Oh. We ll, we did -- we  knew the general situat
ion, yes, but I said before, these details that 
were going on underneath and so on, that we 
only found out much later, after the events. 

Q: You have ma de reference to
 the action that you took, and th
at the Queen mother took -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- in 1942, to st
op the deportation -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- of Jews from Romania. And indeed the 
Queen mother has been recognized as Righteous 
Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, and she is rec --
 so recognized at our museum as well. I™d 
like to ask about some  of the 
people who perhaps helped to 
increase your awar
eness and the 
Queen mother™s awareness of what was actua lly 
happening with the Jews. And I™m -- I -- I™d like 
to ask you about some  individuals because hi stor y 
tells us that certain 
people were involved, but 
we don™t have real confirma tion in most cases. 
One you have ma de reference to, and that is 
Rabbi 
afran. We re you ever approached by ot
her Jewish leaders in the country? 
Q: Yes, I was, Filderma n, who was, I think, the he
ad of the Jewish community in Roma nia as far 
as I reme mb er. But not quite as often as with Rabbi 
afran. But we did -- we did meet him and 
then, with the heads of 
the two political parties,
 [indecipherable] and Br

tiano, indirectly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
25 
 
 
collaborated I™d say, morally with them, because th
ey also tried to push, if not directly with 
Antonescu, but around some how. Then 
he was the patriarch [indeciphe
rable] directly then with 
Antonescu. As far as I reme mber there were one or
 two of his mi nisters, 
I think, who also did not 
agree with this thing and tried to do their best
. They couldn™t get -- do too much because they 
would have been imme diately put out. I™m not su
re of their name s, but I know there were some . 
And a few others, which I do not know exactly who, but I know there were some  -- some  people 

in -- among the higher class in Roma nia that
 did try to influence [indecipherable]. 
Q: Mr. Mokshoni Steercha in his me moirs -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- me ntions just in two words that the r
oyal family was approached by Baron von Neumann 
about this. Do you have recollection of that? 

A: We ll, he was very close to us, with my mo
ther, myself and my fath
er™s secretary was in 
school with me . We used to disc
uss all these things a
nd try and find the ways and means to sort 
of try and put some  brakes on all this and some
how [indecipherable] the 
actual thing itsel f, I™ll 
have to read it again to see how it was, but 
I know we did have ma ny, many meetings with -- 
with him when he was in c -- at court with me
, so we saw him nearly every day. And whenever 

some thing like this came  up we always spent seve
ral hours discussing it, yes, it™s quite true. 
Q: And another name that is mentioned in the -- in those memoirs is Max Auschnitt. 

A: Auschnitt? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Well, I knew him before, my father™s [inde
cipherable] because they had [indecipherable] 
years together with Malaxa. Th
ey™re both industrialists, and th
ey were in certain circles 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
26 
 
 
[indecipherable] but except for knowing him and m
eeting him, I didn™t have anything to do with 
him really. I just -- I just -- 
Q: But you don™t -- you don™t reme mber
 his speaking about this --  
A: No, no. 

Q: -- about the treatment of the Jews? 

A: Because after the -- after my 
father left, all these people di sa
ppeared. They were put away, or 
left, or some thing. So after that
 no, but before [indecipherable]  
Q: We re there foreign diplomats who a
pproached you on the ma tter of the Jews? 
A: No. Because I didn™t have the occasion to m
eet with them. Very, very rarely. If -- and the 
diplomats at that time almost -- you know, the Am
ericans, the British and the others are gone. 
The Germans, I know the ones that were more or le
ss in that line, but we 
never got to talk about 
anything of that, unfortunately. We  
didn™t have enough contact with them. 
Q: And René Devek represented Americ
an interests here during the war.  
A: Not that I reme mber about -- 

Q: He was a Swiss representative. 

A: -- no. Not that I reme mber, mm- mm. 

Q: You ma de reference to the patriarch, Nic
odem -- did you have contact with Metropolitan 
Balun on the issue of the Jews? 

A: With who?  Th -- 

Q: Rabbi Balun of Transy
lvania. Metropolito Balun. 
A: Ah, Balun, yes. Not specially because I used to
 meet all the higher cler
gy, but I had heard that 
he™d tried some thing else, but I 
never talked with him about it. 
With the patriarch yes, but not 
with the others. Patriarch came here several times and he talked to my 
mo ther and try and find 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
27 
 
 
some thing to influence [indecipherable] the others 
I -- I imagine they must have said something. 
I did hear about Balun, but I never pe
rsonally talked to him about that. 
Q: Another church leader, not 
of the Roma nian church, is th
e papal nunzio, Andrea Casullo -- 
A: Mm. 
Q: -- who was here in Bucharest. Again my ques
tion is, was this a person who raised the Jewish 
issue in a significant way? 

A: You see, the situation with Antonescu and me
, and all these people that he had put around me , 
except for [indecipherable] we -- we felt spie
d upon. All these other 
big groups, like church 
dignitary models, well we sht -- imagined that th
ey were proper Christians, what else could I say, 

but you know, we were really cagey about certai
n things because just about [indecipherable] 
Antonescu™s, you didn™t quite dare go and speak
 your mi nd out loudly too much. Not for us, but 
perhaps those people mi ght start suffering afterwar
ds. So we were very, very careful, ma ybe it 
was too muc h, not to say -- not 
to be too, too aggressive, you mi
ght say. We were aggressive 
where -- like my mother was with Antonescu to 
try and get some thing done, but that was inside 
here, sort of not in public. That was a very, ve
ry strange situation, because all these people 
around with big ears report immediately -- I even 
had several occasions wh
en the head of my 
military house here, a general, went  and ma de 
a written report to Antonescu about some thing 
that I talked about. So you see, we
 found that out after a
nd we had to sort of 
pull back a little. It 
was a -- a situation which very difficult for people 
outside the world, this sort of thing to quite 
understand because in Britain and America [indeci
pherable] you breathe the freedom. We did not 
got fr-freedom inside ourselves and our mentality what we couldn™t dare go out quite like we 

would have liked to. S-So me times here and ther
e we ma naged, but not as much as we would 
have liked to.

Q: How wer e  you and the Queen mot her able to discuss these ma tters? 
A: We ll, the -- we didn™t at that time , I don™t 
think we had mi crophones in the house. That came 
ma ny years after. But oh, we talked, we talk
ed, we  talked days and weeks among ours e lves, 
trying to find some  [indecipherable] to impress wh
at we -- our I -- ideas and our me ntalities. And 
that™s why some thing did get 
through. We ll, I can give you a
nother example for instance, 
Antonescu insisted that I should 
go on the front. All right, that 
was probably the right thing to do 
with our troops. But he wanted me  to go to Transn
istria. Wa s that big part of per -- part of land 
between the Dniester and the Bug. That™s where th
e -- the Jews were put. We
ll, I refused flatly. I 
said, I™m not going there. If you want me  to go 
to the front, I™ll take an airplane and go to 
[indecipherable] but I™m not going ther
e. He didn™t like that at all, but he had to -- he swallowed 
it. So, he had unveil a few things like that. We  di
d ma nage, but let™s say the basic part of ruling 

the country, and that, no.  

Q: And your decision not to go to Transnistria, wh
at was the -- the rationa
le for that decision? 
A: What?  To go to Transnistria? 

Q: To not go to Transnistria. 

A: Oh. To Moscow?  No. 

Q: To Transnistria. When Antone
scu wanted you to visit the front. 
A: Ah, yes. Well, he thought it was a -- because 
I was the head of [indecipherable] you see. He 
was comma nding it, but I was the head. It™s a very
 awkward situation there because that was all 
these arrangements that was left over from my
 father. So he found, and I suppose it wa s fairly 
right, that once our troops we
re fighting anyhow, I should show myself a mong them. Which was 
nat-natural, yes, but not, I don™
t think for any other reason, but 
just that, to be among them, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
29 
 
 
which I did, in two or three places, in [indecipherable] and some  other places in the fronts in 
Roma nia when it started, also. But 
only once or twice, not more.  
Q: How did you finally convince Ant
onescu not to deport more Jews? 

A: This is a -- it™s a very long 
story, but I™ll try and concentrate 
it some how, because we were so 
distressed about going into Russia, because it wa s 
none of our business. I know the Roma nians -- 
see, generations, you look at our history, all our 
troubles that we™ve had 
here had always come  
from the east. So after the Russi
an revolution, slowly, slowly, all 
these years, we saw what was 
going on there, so this was certainly not in our
 me ntality. So the fact to take back Tr-
Transylvania and -- I me an Bessarabia and Buchovi
na was perfectly in ag
reement with that, but 
not any further. So, as things were getting frombad to worse, we™d realized ma ybe be fore th-that 

this is going to end extremely badly. We got toge
ther in a clandestine -- 
I sort of picked the 
words not quite right, if you like, on the sly, 
with [indecipherable] and our group of some  
officers, to try and find a way to get out of the wa
r. And this started alre
ady in the end of ™42, it 
went all through ™43 and ™44. That
™s how we had the -- well, th
ere again you have Antonescu 
which is an awkward situation 
[indecipherable] with the German
s, doing everything with the 
Germans and at the same time he let people from
 these two parties go out to [indecipherable]. 

They let them even have, some  of them that were
 in prison, radio transmitter. I-It™s one of these 
situations that doesn™t make 
sense, you know?  But anyhow. So we
 sent some  people out to try 
and contact the allies, that is the American a
nd the Great Britain, to se
e what we can do. We  
probably don™t want to go on with this [indeciphera
ble] we have to get out. So these discussions 
and negotiations, recall they went on quite a l
ong time til late ™43 and ™44, when Britain and 
America said that we won™t discuss with you 
any more, because you™re 
bringing the Communist 
Socialist gr oup in this. We were all shocked abou
t these things because what else we gotta do? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
30 
 
 
We have in Roma nia an -- an population of 
20 million pe ople, about. We  had known, about 500 
Communist me mbers and another 30
0 sympathizers. We ll, what do they got to do with what -- 
this, you see?  We  found that out muc h later, that
 it was the Soviet [indecipherable] that we 
should bring them in. So anyhow, they try and ge
t [indecipherable], the --
 Stalingrad happened. 
The situation was getting more a
nd more dangerously acute. So we 
finally decided that we must 
find the right mo me nt to tell Antonescu that he has 
to stop this war, or ma ke an armi stice. So if 
he doesn™t wa nt to, he™s got to be put out. Th at™s not very easy to say, but, you know, their job 
was going up and down inside Roma nia all the time . 
The Gestapo sitting here, next to the Royal 
Palace and the German c o mmander too, recall [ind
ecipherable]. It™s not very funny, so to speak, 
you know?  We had -- just when the worst part 
is happening, the Russian troops were comi ng 
close to our borders. The Germ
ans funnily enough, they took 
two Panzer divisions from 
Romania and put them up in Poland. Maybe -- maybe 
you heard about all this. But that gave us a 
sort of a little breathing space, but we still 
coul dn™t do anythi ng on our own completely, because 
we asked for help from t he allies, which we di
dn™t even get an answer 
from then. And that™s 
because of the Soviets, we knew that after. So, 
to bring a very long stor
y short, when the front 
collapsed in Bessarabia in the north, Antone
scu came  back fr om the front in the 22
nd
 or 
some thing like that, in August, through an i
ndiscretion [indecipherable]
 we heard the telephone 
conversation, from his headquarters, saying that
 Antonescu is going back
 on the front on the 24
th
, 
I think was. Well our arrangeme nt, which have 
already been done, was to call him on the 26
th
. 
We asked for strong American bombardme nt, for the air force to come  here to hit certain spots 

where the Ge rmans were, and then we hear [indecipherable] 24
th
. So in a great rush, we 
organized the [indecipherable] for the few troops that
 were here, just in ca
se, and I called him, it 
happened to be the 23
rd
 of August, and [indecipherable] spec
ific date [indecipherable] just like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
31 
 
 
that. [indecipherable] came. And that is when 
everybody knows what happened. It™s just that I™d 
like to specify one thing is that it™s always been
 said that it was a coup d™etat, but it -- I don™t 
ma ke coup d™etats. I was the head of state, even
 if he was the [indecipherable] he was called. So 
it was perfectly on my prerogative to dismiss 
him.  So, not a coup d™et
at, you could call it a 
political coup if you like, but that™s not quite th
e same  thing. And our greatest luck of all was 
first of all, surprise, because I™m perfectly convi
nced that the Gestapo and the Secret Se rvices 
here knew that -- exactly that we were pl
otting some thing. The very [indecipherable] 

informations on the political si de, whereas what  ac tually happened was the military side. And 

that they didn™t know. And that was a complete 
surprise, it took them completely by surprise, 
and contrary to what very ma ny people like to 
say, that Romania was liberated by the Soviets, 
which is absolute nonsense, excuse me  the wor
d, because we finish with the Germans in 48 
hours, or four days [indecipherable]. When the 
Russians came  here to [indecipherable] there 
wasn™t single German left. We  -- we ma naged 
to take too, 50,000 prisoners, including the top 
brass, right down to the last, he
re and in other parts around the to
wn. The g -- the ra -- Americans 
bombed those places and that finished the resi
stance, and there were one or two small pockets 
north, near the oil fields, which we
re -- that went pretty quick. And that was all. And that was the 
greatest luck we had. I think we must  have -- how
 shall I say?  God™s hand in all this, because you 
see, another little detail was that when we did this thing in 23
rd
 of Augus t, the Russian advance 
stopped, or slowed. We  didn™t react at the ti
me , be cause we didn™t understand, but later we 

understood what that is. I personally am convinced
 that -- you reme mber in Warsaw we had a 
uprising against the Germans, and the Russian
s stopped the advance, they let the Germans 
[indecipherable] the whole lot, a
nd then they came in. We ll, that™s what they were hoping that 
was going to happen with us, only we had the luck 
to finish ourselves, without them. And that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
32 
 
 
disturbed them very mu ch. But tw
o little details which I can give 
you if you like, from their point 
of view is when -- in the pal
ace it was, on the night of the 23
rd
 of August, the Communist ma n 
came with -- who was known later on as [indeci
pherable], you probably know that. He was -- 
came as another name . But -- but Toscanu, who came in straight to me  in the office where I was, 
and he looked at me  and said, what have you done
, you™ve ruined us. So 
I -- I was speechless. I 
mean, we™d been discussing this thing for months, a
nd I go -- he tells me  that it™s ruined him. We 
understood that later, I™ll come  
to that. When the armi stice -- 
what we call it here, was ma de up 
of a commis sion that went to Moscow. But Toscanu 
let -- leaked it out after that  he went to see 
some  i mportant person i-in Moscow. And he repor
ts to him, he said, what have you done over 
there, you spoiled our business, some thing like th
at. The Roma nian wor d is different. [speaks 
Roma nian]. That™s how they put it. So he sa
id, we ll what -- what is [indecipherable] you know, 
it™s scratching down a bit from the surface, he ca
me  [indecipherable] very slow there in the 
trucks in the northeast, waiting for this to happe
n, and surely they have 
that in mi nd, that the 
Germans we re going to finish us and then they 
could come  and do what they wanted straight 
away. But here is an very important thing, becaus
e I had the supports of th
e two ma in parties, the 
ma in ones, of course the other two also, but
 the strongest support of was the army. So, 

Antonescu was comma nding the army. We ll, when 
I gave the order, there wasn™t one single 
defection. And that is some thi
ng that a -- a -- what I heard would happen in Hungary. It seems 
that [indecipherable] gave the same  order and noth
ing happened. They didn™t listen to him. And I 
don™t know you explained this. Is it the military 
discipline? Is it the oath they took?  Was it 
because the commanders of the big units and all that
, realized as much as us that the whole thing 
is finished, and that some thing 
had to be done?  Or is it a comb in
ation of all that together?  But 
anyhow, it worked, see. Not ma ny people seem t o 
understand quite all th
ese underneath things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
33 
 
 
that were going on, cause all our work, political 
work so to speak, on the sly, that lasted well 
over a year. It came [indecipherable]. It was, of c
ourse, unpleasant for me  in a sense, risking the 
whole thing one -- one side, but An
tonescu were not an enemy of mi ne, he was an adversary, if 
you can call it like [indecipherable] 
I just put in English, because 
he behaved very unpleasantly 
with us. But anyhow, it was some thing I had to 
do, nothing to do with, like ma ny people say, my 
revenge on Antonescu [indecipherable] that™s abso
lute nonsense. I don™t have that. That™s not my  
me ntality. But it was some thing that had to be d
one, and we did what we had to. And that was 
my duty towards my country [indecipherable] th
at™s the ma in thing. With God™s help, we 
ma naged. What happened afterwards, that is a 
completely different question. That™s not our 
doing. So our hope for whoever hears this th
ing will ha ve a better understanding of it. 
Q: That™s -- that™s very intere
sting, and this puts an
 end to the Antonescu regime . I want to ask 
you to come  back with me  just for a mo me nt -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- to 1942, when you and the queen are pressing 
Antonescu to not deport the Jews of Ragatz, 
and southern Transylvania and ask that, were 
you aware that there wa
s a new plan to deport 
Romanian Jews to the concentration camps in Poland? 
A: Yes, that also came from Rabbi 
afran, the infor mation. And then we had heard that 
Eichma nn was around, running around Roma nia, and ta
lking to Antonescu, ta
lking to the Secret 
Service here, Gestapo and what have you, you know
. So that™s why it was -- my mother was 

strong about certain things, because it™s hard 
to br ing Antonescu™s attent ion, but it was unheard 

of, the kind of thing like that, 
it™s -- I don™t know, she used some
 arguments, I don™t reme mber 
exactly, but that got th
rough to him, which -- 

Q: And you knew that these were extermination camps in Poland? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
34 
 
 
A: Yeah, which was fairly unusual with Antone
scu, because he  was very stubborn. But ma ybe he 
had a little soft point some wher
e that my mothe r  managed to ge
t through. So he did not have 
anybody sent out t-to the German 
and Polish [indecipherable]. Yes, 
he did Transnistria, that™s 
true, but it could have been much
 worse. And that was thanks to
 my mother [indecipherable] she 
ma naged to get this, to do some thing th
rough to him. And much also, thanks to 
afran, because 
he used to come  and tell us what™s -- either 
what is happening or wh
at he knew was going to 
happen. So that™s why we could ma nage a little bit to do some thing before.  
Q: One story that we hear -- 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
35 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Your Majesty, I -- I have hear
d that when the Queen Mother wanted to be successful in 
stopping the deportation of Jews, she 
threatened Antonescu, and told hi
m that if this did not stop, 
she would leave the country, and th
at you would leave the country w
ith her. Is this so, and can 
you tell us about what actually ma de the grea
test impression on Antonescu, and when you knew 
that you had been successful? 
A: Yes, now that you mention that, I reme mber va
guely something that my mother told me, that 
she said that, something like that to Antonescu. Wa
s a little bit I said before, when she tried to 

get through to him that this is a [indecipherable] al
l the rest of it [indeciphe
rable] I -- I think that 
probably when she added some thing about me , then -- that we  would leave, or some thing like 

that, I think that™s true, yes. Now that you say it,
 I do reme mb er that she had said some thing to 

me , not muc h detail, but just a fe
w words to that effect, yes.  

Q: And was this what ma de the difference? 
A: Yes, you know, she had a very, very deep relig
ious feeling. She was 
mo re -- let™s say more 
Christian than religious, inspired by her family. 
A very, very strong moral sense, and these sort 
of things that were going on, just -- she could not 
take them. I t  was not just
 sitting still, she had 
to say some thing, and some ti me s I heard her say to
 the other people some  very, very -- really 
strong things. And she didn't mi nce her words at a
ll, so ma ybe in this particular occasion, she 
used that type of talk with Antonescu. I don™t know,
 I wasn™t there when she said that to him, or 
ma ybe she -- I was there, but she said it in a corn
er. I didn™t hear her sa
y it, but she told me  
afterward, now that you remi nded me of it. 
Q: And Antonescu™s reaction once this was decided, 
was anger, or what -- 
what was his reaction? 
A: Well, that  was the [i ndecipherable] surely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
36 
 
 
Q: You have described already 
your action to remove Antonescu 
from power. Within two years 
after that, you signed his death sentence, and he
 wa s executed together with Mihai Antonescu, 
and Alexianu, the governor of Tran
snistria, and Mr. Vasiliu from 
the Ministry of the Interior. 
When you removed Antonescu from power, did you exp
ect to be signing his 
death sentence after 
that? 
A: What do you [indecipherable] 

Q: Did you expect that th
e course of events -- 
A: Oh. 

Q: -- following his removal would lead to his death sentence? 

A: We ll, yes, we did ima gine that probably 
some thing like that would happen. I mean, the 
judgeme nt. But the whole way this was done -- you 
see, this is [indecipherable] one of these 
cunning things with the Soviets. Coul d I say some
thing before that? I have  been accused of ma ny 
people that I gave up Antonescu 
to the Communis t s, which is not true, for the simple reason, on 
the night of the 23
rd
 to the 24
th
 of August, we were over our heads with reorganizing the whole 
thing, ma king the governme nt, na mi ng mi nisters, a
nd all the rest that went with it. And then, 

some  officers in the general staff, through one
 of my [indecipherable] said, you must leave 
Bucharest as quick as possible, because there™s go
ing to be s -- reprisals from the Germans, as 
the American bombing couldn™t have happened before the 26
th
. So we all packed up in a hurry, 
and I left Bucharest at around two 
or half past two in the morning. We went out to the west 

[indecipherable] the country. Now, we had organized
 with the two parties to have a team that™s 
going to take  over Antonescu and take care of h
im, because we didn™t wa nt some thing to happen 
with him like with Mussolini, ge t him out. So, 
unfortunately these two 
parties did not have 
anybody ready because it happened too quick. The onl
y one that had a team ready of course, was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
37 
 
 
the Communists [indecipherable]. So around four 
in the mor ning they came to the palace and 
said, we have  to take  care of this thing, because 
if nothing happens, and th -- the Pr ime Minist er I 
named, General S

n

tescu, ma ybe in a little mo me nt of wea
kness, let them take hi m. So they 
took him to the seat of the Comm
unist party in Bucharest, yea
h, a place called [indecipherable]. 
Well, I was in -- already in the western part of
 the country, how could I have done that, see?  
Now, the Communists, as I was comi ng to say is 
that they took -- when the Russians came  in 
here, of course they took him, Moscow -- L
ubyan, I think, the prison. Th
ey kept him for two 
years, about. So what happened in the meantime , the Russian troops were here, they started 
me ssing up all the political parts, me ssing up what
 I was trying to do. [indecipherable] come  in 
here and smashing door in my o
ffice, [indecipherable] on the tabl
e [indecipherable] forcing me  
to put Groza on, bringing in al
l the Communists in ™45. So it™s 
not -- th-things started to 
deteriorate, I wouldn™t say ver
y, very fast, but very clearly. So, in the meantime the population 

was getting sort of worked up, mode
rately at least. So in the two 
years that Antonescu was hir -- 
kept by the Russians, th-the pe
ople st arted to see 
that perhaps was better during Antonescu™s 
time than it was now. Which, in fact, it was, 
unfortunately, except for the war. So when 
Antonescu got back and put on trial, all these peop
le were sort of said, after all, he™s done 
some thing, these people, look what they™re doing, 
see?  On that I™m convinced that the way they 
did this trial, which was a farce, all of it fi xed 
beforehand like the Nazis used to do also, like in 
Russia. It wa s done I thi -- I -- felt there -- m- ma
ybe I think of it now, to 
-- to bring down my 
image. See -- you see, in that time I don™t 
know -- want to know everything that™s 

[indecipherable] not with th
e thing behind it. Now what, constitutionally speaking, my 
[indecipherable] my situation wa
s that no act is valid that I 
would sign without the counter-
signature of the mi nister. That is in our constitu
tion because it™s the mi nister that countersigns 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
38 
 
 
that is responsible, not me . S
o, whe n they came out with the se
ntences -- now, the Minister of 
Justice at the time, Patrascanu came [indeci
pherable] saying -- asking for pardon, which 
Antonescu did not do. With -- his 
lawyer did it, but not him. So
 on, and then he said no, no, no, 
one or two years. So constitutionally speaking, what
 will be my position?  I 
could refuse that and 
sign some thing else, but nothi
ng will have happened. That™s
 one thing. And the second 
complication was that -- that there were Soviets 
behind it. I™m absolutely certain [indecipherable] 
American. So even if anybody would have wantedto [indecipherable] this thing, it would not 
have been possible. And that™s how it happened. 
And the way they did that was -- excuse me  the 
word, was absolutely disgusting. Ca
use after all, he was a patriot,
 he loved his country, he tried 
to defeat [indecipherable] and so on. He -- politic
ally he did it for the -- my question wa s what 
could we do?  [indecipherable] But his feelings 
we re the Romanian [indecipherable]. Although he 
was [indecipherable] things that went on, still. 
And the way this was done was -- was not a trial, 
they were murderers, to put it quite fr ankly, and 
was very distressing for 
me  and my mother and 
all the others, ever after what
 we been though. And the way he
 ended, I didn™t like it, although 
probably some thing had to be done, you couldn™
t avoid that, you know. Not quite like that, you 
know?  No ma tter what he did and all that, he
 is still [indecipher
able] you know, they did 
[indecipherable] 

Q: When the war ended, your Majesty, you faced
 another huge challenge here, and you had 
begun to talk about it. You showed great cour
age in opposing the communization of Roma nia. 
After four years of war, and th
is invasion of the Soviet Union 
that you have referred to, do you 
believe it was possible for Roma nia to resist th
e imposition of a Communi st regime ?  That it was 
realistic to think that  this was possibl e?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420  
39 
 
 
Q: Well, all these things that happened after [i
ndecipherable] circles of 
high politics in the world, 
that were not our doings. And we we re in a way, th
e victims of all these things. I tried to do what 
I could to put brakes on it. And because it was -- 
these arrangeme nts were in high circles. I don™t 
mean to be unfair, mi sunderstanding, but we di
d not get the proper back
ing and help from the 
western allies. We  know [i
ndecipherable] percentages. So the 
Soviets that came here, they were 
the monsters and they would do what they want, 
and how they wanted. I know
 there were a lot of 
-- a lot of -- lot of contacts with the American
 person in [indecipherable] commission and the 
British one. And they were doing what they 
could here, locally. And they understood the 
situation very well, but they didn™t, as far 
as I can ma ke out get the true backing from 

Washington and London [indecipherable] these big 
arrangeme nts. And there™s not muc h more I 
can tell you about that. I did what 
I could with who I could, whethe
r it™s [indecipherable] I say, a 
losing battle in a way, but at l
east one thing I can say, 
that like [indecipherable] like my mother, 
too. Maybe we lost our batt
le, at least we lost it with some di
gnity, with our heads up that we did 
at least tried to do what we c
ould to save what we could -- 
be saved. It didn™t work, but not 
because of us .  

Q: Looking back 50 years to this period of time t h
at we have talked about, and especially the 
years when you were king, from 1940 through 1
947, how would you characte
rize those years in 
Roma nia™s history? 

A: It™s difficult to put that in one word. What 
could I say?  Besides being sad, it was more than 
frustrating. You see what was happening, you have
 your hands tied. I was 
here in the position 
which was supposed to do more, and I couldn™t.
 You know, it™s frustratin
g, perhaps you™re not 
strong enough, but I don™t know what other words to
 put in it. We  fought like lions and tigers. 
Our conscience, my mother and mys e lf, is cl
ear. We had hands tied, you know, that™s why I say 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420

frustrating, we were -- I don™t know 
a better word for that, but to say it was difficult is a -- an 
understateme nt of [indecipherable] you know. Th
at™s how things happen some ti me s, you know. 
You know, they say sometimes very often that th
e ways of the lord are many and unpenetrable. 
We never quite know what these meanings are, w
hy these things happen. You try to do the best, 
someti mes it works, sometimes it doesn™t. I don™t
 know. I don™t want to 
be [indecipherable] you 
know, but I mean, you know -- you -- you think a
bout these thing, you can™t
 put it out of your 
mi nd sometime. And that™s one side -- all right, 
that™s me  personally, you see, but I look at 
what™s happened to this part 
of Europe and my c ountry. So that [indecipherable] on top of it. 
Difficult to explain sometime, very difficult. 
People say you get bitter, yes, you do get bitter 
some ti me s, but if you let bitterness lead you, that means you go down the drain with it. That™s 

not the way to do thing. I mean, it™s sad and it™s
 painful, it™s wounds you have, but you mi ght -- 
mi ght let that take you -- lead you, because then 
you -- then you say, I™m not so good at all. So 
we tried at least. I -- I hope
 I ma naged to [indecipherable]. 
Q: I would like to thank you very mu ch for 
sharing these thoughts w
ith us today. Thank you, 
your Majesty. 

A: We ll, I can perhaps add some thing, that with 
all these awful things that have been happening 
since the war, especially in this part of Eu
rope and Roma nia, being on a program like yours now, 
I do hope that ma ybe I can -- I brought some  light 
into some  events, to explain certain things 
which I™m quite convinced that very few people 
know. [indecipherable] and 
the thing happens as 
[indecipherable] you see events, you start ma king 
up your mi nd. Make decisions, or have ideas 
which are not actually based on the full knowledge of what™s what. And that is what I™ve been 

trying all these years to sort of
 bring out. To stop looking at the 
surface of things, which are bad 
or good, whatever it is. What -- th
e point it, why have we got 
to a certain point if you don™t

understand what™s happened underneat
h. And that is a sort of grudge
 I have against ma ny peopl e, 
that they dis -- they di scuss the -- the signs 
on the surface, without bothe ring to go underneath 
and find out why, what are the causes of these thi
ngs, and to ma ke -- to try and get that thing 
healed up. And then the rest should follow. You 
know, they say some ti me s that it™s a very -- how 
most people cut the branches [indecipherable] 
off, but a very, very few that look at the 
underneath of the -- at the roots of it. And that™s 
what I wish so much, with all this modern world 
now and the people that -- that -- you know, ever
ything™s [indecipherable] 
all over the place now, 
to -- to try and understand why di
d certain things happen, and thetragedy of the whole -- what 

will you say, let™s say in this 
part of Europe, a hundred millio
n people here. And unfortunately 
it™s ha ppening in other pl aces also now. And we
 feel terrible when we see these thing 
[indecipherable] here, of course
, because it™s my country, but 
when you see other things that 
happen -- look at New York now. Which just -- 
I don™t know. We  -- we have another Roma nian 
saying that says, when God wants to mock the pe
ople, they take [indecipherable]. I don™t like 
that, but when you see what™s happening in th
e world these days, you re
ally don™t know. You 
can™t understand any mo re, some time. Anyhow, I th
at what -- I me an they™re saying now that 
they™ll be a better understanding, at
 least as far as we are con
cerned, what happened. And I thank 
you very mu ch for it. 

Q: Thank you, sir.
