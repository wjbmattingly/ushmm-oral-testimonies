JOEL ELKES and AVRAHAM TORY 
September 26, 1991 
 
E: Avraham, we are here to r
ecollect and to reconnect. To c
onnect the parents, my parents  
which whom you knew with the parents w
hom I  reme mber. And I think we should 
perhaps begin by recalling the way I reme mber 
my parents br iefly and then give you the 
opportunity to tell us, all of us, how you saw 
them and how you experienced them. It is 
very important, I think, to establish this 
connection because you are a witness and I am 
only a witness once or twice removed. I have 
experienced it through 
your writings and in 
my i magination. You actually were there. And 
our object is in this conversation is to 
connect what I reme mbe r  and what I knew 
with what you saw and you experienced. Does 
that seem a very good way of 
going about this discussion? 
 

T: Anything you say. 

 

E: Well,I... 

 

T: You ma de a very nice introduction and I you. 
So please st art and then I will come in. I'll 
step at the right mo ment. 
 

E: I'll be very brief. 

 

T: Yes. 

 

E: I'll be very brief. As you know, we both were
 in Lithuanian. You're in my employee. I am 
Kovno. You and I went to Hebrew schools wh
ere everything was ta
ught in Hebrew. A 
unique experience for both of us. My father
 helped to found in Kovno which is known as 
the. And I am just going to ramble along 
a little because it will give you...us both the 

feeling or give whoever wants to see it, th
e feeling of our experience, growing up in 
Lithuanian at the time before World War II.
 The extraordinary e
xperience of being 
educated in Hebrew about the 
world, not just about Judaism. I reme mber in my school, 
being taught in Hebrew about Voltaire and 
Gerter, by the same  teacher who taught me  

also and Hebrew history. The same  ma n wa
s Voltaire on Tuesday's and was on Friday's. 
And father had a lot to do with that ki
nd of spirit and...and....bri
nging the school into 
being. I remember my gr andparents, and Sarah El
kes, my father's parents, living in a little 
steetle in Kovia where my father was born in
 1879. I reme mb er who wa
s sitting in a little 
back of his shop reading the Talmud where he
 was selling herring and to the peasants, 
saying, "You want to know some thing about 
your father?  I'll tell 
you." When he was 10 
he was redheaded and he started reading 
the Russian encyclopedia, volume one, and 
simply whe n on with." That's all I re
me mber. Nobody knew where he got his first 
education. But what they did know is that he
 was a from beginning to end. He learned by 
himself. He was self prepared. He went a
nd studied me dicine in Kernicksburg. How the 
Hell he got (pardon the expression) got into 
me dicine school to this day I do not know, 

with his qualifications, but he 
got in. And he studied me dici
ne in Kernicksburg and then 
tutored Hebrew to ma ke a liv
ing, to keep body and soul toge
ther and then me t ﬂMiriam

Muldune who began his wife, who was his pupi
l and became his wife. When he returned, 
he became a officer in the Russian army, and he
 traveled from to the and back again. But 
one thing I reme mber of which will keep 
in...in history books, I think you are going to 
say about him is this. He told me  that in 
his regime nt he was the only Jewish officer. 
 

T: Right. 

 

E: And there were always anti-se mitic, an
ti-semites around and there were anti-semitic 
rema rks ma de. And he is on record as saying, 
"In my presence there will be no scurrilous 
rema rks about my people," and getting up 
and walking out. And...and he....the other 
officers knew that you do not engage in this ki
nd of conversation in th
e presence of this 
ma n, Elkes. You just don't take him on. 
 

T: This is exactly what he told me  while we were in ghetto. 

 

E: Hedid? 

 

T: About this service in the army, and they 
called him. They didn't call him. They just... 
 

E: Talked about Judaism. 

 

T: And the Jews should go out, that they don't 
belong here, so he immediately said, "I will 
never dine...it was in the... in the dining room... 
 

E: In the mess...the mess room. 

 
T: In the me ss room... So he said...he came  to hi
s officer, to his superior , and he said, "I will 
never again step in in this mess room because
 I don't want to hear such expressions." 
And...uh...and to the greatest surprise of Dr. Elkes, his superior just ordered as Dr. Elkes 
said he would want it...it to be. That the wo
rd is not only a...a translation into Russian 
from the word Jew in ...in is much more than this. 
 

E: Thehuman.  

 

T: Thehumani zation. 

 

E: Yes.Yes. 

 

T: Degradation. Jid is this 
everything bad. Whatever... And he...a
nd he spoke to me  about it. 
 

E: And that is...that is really 
in a sense a of things to come. 
 

T: Yes, of course. 

 

E: Because that really is 
a...an instance of the world...

T: He told me about me about it in a contact
 after his very serious and very dangerous 
conversation with one of the top 
people of the Gestapo in Kovno. 
 
E: Yes. Yes. That is the co
nnection which I want to ma ke. 
 

T: Exactly. 

 

E: Exactly. Exactly. And then as you reme mber, 
he settled in Li thuania and rapidly became  
the leading physician of the town and the count
ry. He helped to found the Jewish hospital 
in. He helped to found the Jewish school, a 
number of other institutions, but he. He 
refused to serve on committees, councils, anything, of any kind. He was just very much a 

private person. And in this his wife, Miriam, 
supported him. And I reme mber that ours 
was...myself, my sister, Sarah's, was a quiet
 life. It was a very 
private life. Not ma ny 
parties. Not ma ny...uh...official functions. No
thing of the high life that usually 
accompanies the desperation of the country. Not 
at all. Very, very quiet and private and 
confused. It is important in 
view of the fact that later 
on, when you came to mi nd, he took 
on such hugh...hugh public 
responsibilities. 
 

T: He didn't wa nt it. 

 

E: He didn't wa nt it?  Both pe
ople were talking at once at this
 time , and I could not ma ke out 
their conversation. 
 

T: He...Yes. 

 

E: And then he became a very well known as
 a physician, very well accepted by the whole 
diplomatic corps, the Russian and the Ge
rman a mbassador, and the Swedish ambassador 
and the British ambassador and the American
 ambassador, they were all his patients. 
 

T: And the Japanese council. 

 

E: And the Japanese council which we will come to in a mo ment. 

 

T: Yes. Very important. 

 

E: And they became very important too. And he
 became physician to the Prime Minister and 
his wife. And I reme mbe r  one instance which again speaks to the same  kind of 

characteristic. It was Saturday and I answ
ered the telephone and on the telephone was the 
secretary of the wife of the Prime MInister. 
 

T: – 

 

E: – 

 

T: –

E: And then she came on the telephone phone a
nd and I passed the telephone to father. And 
he said....this was a Saturday, Sabbath.  And sh
e said, "May I see you." He  said, "Yes.ﬂ Is 
it urgent?" She said, "It's not very urgent." 
And he said in his ni
ce, polite quiet way he 
said, It is my Saturday. Perhaps we can meet
 tomorrow or the day after?  Would that be 
convenient?" And she said, "Thank you, I will be  
very glad."  He stressed that not only 
that he was not available, but it is my Saturday
 and unless it is very 
urgent, I prefer to see 
you when I am working and not on my Saturd
ay. This is the kind of reserve and...and 
respect which he...he treated all his patients,
 and by contrast I unde
rstood something else. 
Because he was enormo usly generous in his se
rvices, hi s waiting room was always full of 
poor people. Poor folks he saw for free, and mi xed with...with some  of the high society 
people. They waited in the same  waiting room
, and there was never any give or take, 
any...any privileges. He was extraordinary ge
nerous with his time. Uh...He ma de hous e 
calls continuously again to poor home s . No 
compensation. Just because he reme mbered 
that patient and that patient a
nd that patient.ﬂŁ So he was...he
 had this enormous presence 
about him when he dealt with people who 
...of standing and warmth and kindness which 

emanated from hi m whe n he was with patient
s, any patient, which became  legendary and 
which I am sure Dr. Brauns' father, 
who was his assistant, commented on. 
 

E: The Interior Departme nt of the Hosp
ital of which your father was the head.  
 

T: Yes. Yes. So these are so me  of the 
things which...which I recall so vividly 
about..uh...about Dr. Elkes. The extraordinary se
nse of presence, generosity, kindness, 
and also a deep philosophical bent which vi
ewed the Jewish et hic which we lived and 

breathed as the ethic of ma n. I can give you an
 instance. On his desk, there stood a little 
tablet taken from the grave from a Emmanue
l. Emmanuel was buried in, and on his grave 
there is a little tabl et which is known as the
... And it recalls the saying of which my fa ther 
used to repeat to Sarah and me .  And it goes 
transl ated something like this. "Two things 
occupy, continue to occupy the mi nd and fill it 
with ever gr owing astoni shme nt and more 
than mi nd occupying itself really. One is a th
e starry sky above me , and the other is the 
morale law within me ." And Elhanan Elkes re
ally lived these...these simp le, these two. 
Day by Day. And in some way he combined them
 with a deep sense of Jewish identity.  
 

E: Because these emanates from his education, 
which he got a very religious education at 
his time, where was not even schools and not 
even modern s c hools. It was a seder so 
called, and a ﬂ which if you didn't comply with
 what he gave you, also with a bite you 
know. ﬂ  
 

T: Yes.Yes. 

 

E: But this is what was the very basic of his 
Jewish education and it ke
pt him...and he kept it 
with him all the year s until he was the heri
tage, the Jewish heritage and the Jewish 
morales. 
 

T: Yeah. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315

E: Jewish morales. Because he always spoke about it in the ghetto with me , e ven in the 
council. There is a morale...and...and when I ta
lk about...about your father when he was 
in the ghetto, I'll come back to it why in the 
very crucial day before the 28th of October, 
when the great selection of 10,000 inma tes of th
e ghetto were taken out, he didn't want to 

comply with the order of the Gestapo that
 the Jewi sh Council should order...should not 
publish...should order all the inma tes of 
the ghetto...then the population of 30,000, to 

report at the 28th of October at
 6 in the morning at the...at 
the Seventh square. And when 
the...the opinion of the me n of the Jewish 
committee were, he asked...the chief rabbi, who 
was a great scholar of all faiths, was a...he wa
s a candidate to be chief rabbiﬂ Łt hen to 
consult hi m on this matter. This st ems all fr
om his Jewish education which was deep and 
rooted in his heart and mind. 
  

T: Yes...I...I really want to...I'm so glad to 
bring that out in this 
context...in your context 
because that again ma kes...uh...the connection wh
ich is the purpose of this conversation. 

Uh...The other and related aspect. Growing...t
he same  tree growing from a  different 
group is to br ing the reality....day to da y realit
y, the day to day reality of Arab's Israel 
long before because to hi m the day to day re
ality and to which he conveye d to us as 

children, which he conveyed to 
his school which we took part. 
 

E: Well, this is why he was one of the 3 trust
ees of the pioneer farm, the Jewish...there were 
pioneer farm....the Jewish...there were pioneer 
moveme nts in the...in the...in Lithuanian, 
and there were pioneer moveme nts of the so-c
alled social , social 
Zionists and general 
Zionists. He didn't care. But they bought a fa
rm from a Lithuanian in order to train...to 
train their...those pioneers from the Zionistmoveme nt in order to bring...to train them 

in... in agricultural work to be...to be ripe forthe...for the lif
e in...pioneer life in Israel.  
 
T: In days to come . In days to come . 
 

E: And this was...and he...this was a non-politic
al...it was a general farm of training  in 
English trade. 
 

T: Preparation. 

 

E: Yeah. And this is was near a little steetle. 

 

T: And he and I stayed there and what is more
, every Friday ther e there was a to dinner with 
us. 
 

E: Ofcourse. 

 

T: Every Friday, and he...the the young people ca
me  to us and my mother would talk to 
them. And I reme mber the vivid, very, very
 well and the treme ndous enthusiasm which 
he had for this enterprise. You see he, bring br
ought up in Kovia in a 
little town. He lived 
near a farm. He knew what...what a pumpki
n, and a...an onion and a potato looked and 

smelled like. I mean he had done it. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315

E: The ma in purpose. Education....educating a 
new a generation of Jews who were most ly 
citizens...of the citizens. They
 had no profession. They had no 
linkage to...to the farm, to 
land, to agriculture. And not onl
y was he the...a trustee...bu
t in a...in a public function, 
but he was also the physician of all the and th
ey we re treated by him...it is...it is...ﬂ Łfree 
of charge. No question about it. But in serious
 cases, he used to go there to them and call 
them on the spot and give to them. 
 

T: Yes. I reme mber that. I went with him. 

 

E: And this, bear in mi nd, is a physician 
of...of outs t anding qualifications who was the 
physician of the prime minister of the presid
ent of the state, of the ambassadors as you 
said. But in first place he  was the...the 
physician of the humble, of the popular. 
 

T: Yes.Yes. 

 

E: And I want to say another word. I was...
it is...there was a near Godless state where no 
before you  
 

T: Yes. We  had...we had an old apartment. 

 

E: The old apartment. I was there because my
 father was ill and I wa
s there. So you could 
always find a food pack. And not only people wi
th very, as you said, well dressed and 

people who came very, very poorly. Very poorly. 
 

T: Yes.Yes. 

 
E: And I want to say not only Jews. 
 

T: No. No. No. 

 

E: Not only Jews. 

 

T: No. No. He had... 

 

E: Because his door was open for every needy 
and for every ma n or woma n who needed and 
could not afford to pay. 
 

T: Yes. Yes. Yes. I reme mber him. And th
en we are now comi ng to a time  when he 
consulted the priest of the British Ambassador
 and he said, "What shall I do for my s on?" 
He said, "Send him to English. I've been t
o...I graduated my school in...in Lithuanian, 
Hebrew school. And then for good measure, I went to a German school in Kernicksburg 

which turned out to be a  in 1929, 30, whic
h was already was fee
ling the tremor of 
Nazism, and I felt it very much there. I was th
e only Jew there. And 
then he went to the 
French Ambassador and said, "Is there a possibi
lity." And he said, "Yes, of course." And 
he wrote a letter and that is how I we nt to 
England and then where Sarah followed me in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315

1937. And then he and I corresponded in my th
roughout the years. I went to the Zionist 
Congress in  
 

E: In 30...in 39. 

 

T: 39. 

 

E: But it was not a 39 was in...39 was in Geneva. Perhaps you were a Congress before.  

 

T: The congress before. In Basil.
 I remember it was in Basil. 

 

E: This is a Basil. It was the 20th Congress.I was 20th Congress which was the last Zionist 
World Congress, before the war. 
 

T: Beforethewar. 

 

E: At the end...at the end actually, the c
ongress were closed immediately because the 
declaration, the German declared war against Poland. 
 

T: August 1st. August 1st. Yes. 

 

E: Yeah. August first, in 1939. 

 

T: Well, I saw him the last time in 1938. He ha
d come  and visit me  in...in the...England and 
brought...and Sarah accompanied him. Your parents came. And I saw him last time in 

1943. And...uh...I still reme mber.... 
 

T: 36? 

 

E: 38.Fine. 

 

T: Uh. – had just been occupied, and he had consulted the German a mbassador whether it's 
safe for me  to travel to Ge rmany. And the German ambassador told him never had our 

relations between them been bette .  And that 
is when I saw him last at the railway station 
when my mother andIwere...my mother and he
 seen me  off. And then, of course, there 
was recollects again and then the letters 
stopped. And the letters stopped comi ng and 
there was the Russian occupati
on of Lithuanian where I he
ard only indirectly of his 
activities and the ways he was handling the si
tuation toward his family and above of all 
for his colleagues and himself. And you served
 with him at that time . You knew...I had 
already lost contac
t with him in 1838. 
 

E: But then I started my contact with him. So there is a some  continuation, not a– 

 

T: Entirely continuity with him, and this is 
really what I wanted 
by way of introduction to 
you...bring you to the point where you saw hi
m a nd I only learned about him through you 
and other friends, but ma inly through you and – So let me  ask you now, When the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315  
8 
 
Russians came  and they...and they were, of 
course, very suspicious of...of...people who 
were well placed economi cally and socially a
nd so on, what can you recall of that pe riod? 
 
E: Well, first of all, the fate of your father 
wouldn't be much better than the fate of those 
Zionists and well to do Jews in Lithuania
n. They would have simply exiled him to 
Siberia. And in fact they came to do so. Th
ey came to do so in the mi ddle....in the mi ddle 
of the night. So he when they came to takehim from his home, he said that he wants 

to...to see the...the Soviet Ambassador in...in Li
thuanian. This was entirely a very, very 

exceptional case because most of the Jews wh
en they came to took, they didn't speak to 
them at all because they didn't have to sa
y. They didn't have anything to...to...to...to call 

upon while Dr. Elkes was the...the private doc
tor physician of the Soviet Ambassador as 
well as ma ny other ambassadors, so he told th
em, "Wait, a mi nute. I want to talk to...you 
must wait until the morning." They don't wa
nt to wait. So he said, "You...you....if you 
don't want to wait, let me call them right now
." And he called in the mi ddle of the night 
to the...to the Soviet Ambassador and this is
 thanks to his innova
tion, they...they didn't  

take him and his wife like the houses right 
on the truck and right you go to the train and 
this is how he was rescued from the exile to 
Siberia, which was the fate of thousands of 

Jews which was supposed to have been my fate too but they didn't like very much the 

idea of being exiled to Si beria. 
So...uh...But this is what he to
ld me  when we were in the 
ghetto. But....uh...to... to ...the first encounter of
...of me  with Dr. El
kes was in the...when 
the order was published that Jews should be
 expuls...to the ...should be the expulsion of 
Jews from Kovno to the ghetto... 
 

E: That was after the...after the....when th
e German...after the German occupation? 
 

T: After the...the...the Soviet 
occupation lasted for 1 year. 
 

E: Yes. 

 

T: June 40 to June 41. 

 

E: Yes. 

 

T: I me ntion this exile because I...I followed you... 

 

E: Yes.Yes. 

 

T: But also you see, Dr. Elkes with me , to
ld me  not only about his...his danger...his being 
almost expelled. The same  happene d to the fo
rmer Pri me Minist er of
 Lithuanian who was 
the last prime mi nister of Lit
huania, who was great pride, wi
th great esteem we were the 
guest of honor in Moscow several months ago.  
 

E: Yes. 

 

T: They tried to get his signature on a ...on a 
agreement. They call it–in Lithuania. Asked 
the Soviet Union to be...to be one of th
e 60th Republics, and he...and he...and he didn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315  
9 
 
want to do it. So then when the Soviet s occu
pi ed Lithuanian with military bases, they 
came in one of those nights where they calle
d upon your father so. 
They called the the 
prime mi nister was visited his ﬂŁhome and he 
claime d he was very si
ck and he cannot...he 
he...he cannot be move...shouldn't be moved from
 his bed.  And they didn't hear...listen to 
them, so he said, "Here, call my doctor." So 
they said, "Who is my doctor?" He said, "Dr. 
Elkes is my doctor. I cannot move. I 'm
...If you move...if you take me  from the bed, 
I'll...I'll...I'll die." So the...the...uh...the Secret
 Police at that time  
went imme diately to 
the...to your father's  home and they took hi
m out from his bed. They said the prime 
mi nister, the for mer prime mi nister is sick, 
very sick, and they didn't tell him what for 
they'r e taking him. So he  said, "Can't  it wa
it until the morning?  It's the mi ddle of the 
night. It's 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock." "No, it's urge
nt. He's  very sick. You mus t  go. And they 
took him out from his bed and they brought hi
m to the...to the...to 
the apartment of the 
prime mi nister and there Dr. Elkes just... uh....j
ust ma de it...he gave 
me  a...a picture of 
this scene that he witnessed. He came into 
the house. Of course
, led by three secret 
police, and they find the prime...prime mi nist
er in pajama s in his bed, and he...and he 
cries out, "Lord, I am sick. I am going to die." And...and all kinds of...and he jumps like a 

clown. So...so he went and he says...so when
 he saw...when the the Prime  Minister saw 
Elkes, he says, "Doctor, rescue me . Rescue me
. They want to take me . They want to take 
me out of my bed. Rescue me. Tell them. Tell 
them that I'm so sick." So the...the...Dr. 
Elkes in his very way, calm way, says, Mr. ca
lm down just a mi nute. I want to check you. 
And he said to the...the secret
 police. They didn't move from t he room. He  said, "If I have 
to check my patient you cannot stay in the r
oom." So they said, "Under no circumstances. 
Under no circumstances. We have orders to 
take him." So Dr. Elkes said, "You cannot 

take him away. The ma n is sick. You can see 
the ma n is sick. I have to calm hi m down. 
You can't ...I, as a physician, don't...cannot take th
at responsibility. If 
I have to treat him 

you have to leave the room and I want to ha
ve a private checking of
 the prime mi nister 
and not because he's a prime mi nister but ever
y patient. This is the alfa and the omega of 
a...of a physician. And I want to tell you to the gr
eatest surprise of hims
elf, they just...he 
made them respect hi m. This was the i
nner strength, morale strength. He speaks 
to...to...to...to intelligence, secret intelligence. 
This is the most degraded people you can 
ever meet under...under the Heavens. And they 
had no way out but they had to leave the 
room and leave him. And then he told hi
m, "Look, ﬂ you cannot play around with these 
people. Tell me  what...what...what do you feel
?  What is the...the trouble?" He said, "I 
just...just don't want to go, and you must help
 me." "He said, "Be quiet. Speak quietly. 
Because if they hear that, they
'll arrest you. They'll arrest me." To cut a long story shor t, 
he...they came  in. They couldn't wait so...as l
ong as Dr. Elkes because Dr. Elkes wouldn't 
invite them at all.  So they entered the r
oom and they say...Dr. Elkes said, "The ma n is 
sick. Can't it for a couple of days, 2 or 3 da
ys?  I'll take care of him and then you'll do 
with him." "No, we have orders. We  must  imme diately report 
it to...no he didn't say 
where or what. He said, "We mu
st immediately take him under 
arrest." So he said, "I...I, 
as physician, cannot allow to do this...so becau
se he needs medical care of a physician." 

So he says, "You come  with me ...you come ...you 
come  with us." So he said, "I cannot go. 
I am head of the department in the hospita
l in and patients are waiting for me . I have a 
whole schedule for the morning, the next day 
and I cannot just leav
e the patients along.ﬂ 
So he said...and besides... "No, you go with 
me  immediately. "How can I go with you. 
I...I...I have  to get dr essed." And they 
said, "We have...you have to accom
pany him until

the border with the Soviet Union, with Russia." So he says, "If I have to go I have to get 
dressed." So they took him back to his 
apartment and they took a...it was a– 
 

T: Heavycoat? 

 

E: Coat and some...some medi
cine. I don't know what... 
 

T: And he accompanied the prime mi nister to the ... 

 

E: No. They took him and the prime mi nister a
nd they wrapped in the
...in the, you know in 
the... 
 

E:  I n  t h e  bl a n ke t s . 

 

T: In the blankets and with the pajama s 
you know, they...they bound him like a...like a rope, 
you know, you see, like you take a ...a bundle, a 
bundle of...of clothes or some thing. They 
threw him in...in...in their car and Dr. Elkes as
ide him. And they came to the train and 

then there was a special  a special compartm
ent where it was for the prime mi nister and 
Dr. Elkes and he...they said, "Doctor, you are res
ponsible for...for this 
ﬂ that he shouldn't 
jump out of the...through the window." So he sa
id, "I am...can only take care of him as a 
physician. I have no idea and I have no tools 
and ways to safeguard him what you do." So 
this is your duty actually. You are the secu
rity people. You are the ma in people of 
security. And...and then this is how he went 
all the night long until they...they came to the 
fr ontier and then they let him 
off and he could come  back.ﬂ  
 

T: Well that again is... 
 
E: This is what he told me  when we we re in
 the ghetto because in the ghetto it was not only 
a relationship started, of course, when I 
was...when he was elected of....... But we 
developed a very, very close personal relati
onship that I never be
fore experienced in 
all...in all my young life that time. Because af
ter all Dr. Elke s was a ma n of over 60 and I 
was a young ma n, spokesman, and student 
whatever it is and what not. 
And...uh...nevertheless, it...it developed such a re
lationship that we us
ed to go out in a 
later time. Also, I should accompany from the
...from the offices of the Jewish Committee 
to his.... 
 

T: – 

 

E: So come  back now about to the time when 
you met him after the Nazi, the first...I me an 
the first days of the Nazi occupation. 
 

T: Yes. 

 

E: Come back to that. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315

T: Well, I made...I made an aborted attempt 
to...to escape to run way from Kovno, and from 
Lithuanian. On a bicycle, imme diately on the 23rd. 
 
E: On the 23rd.  

 

T: On the 22nd... 

 

E: And then they came. 

 

T: On the 22nd, the war break out. I was waiting 
at...at my sister's home for a...for a wagon 
to take us, and it didn't come  until 2:30. This
 is how I started to make to make my– 
 

E: That was...that was the hist
oric day on which you started. 
 

T: In the evening...in the evening, at mi dnight on the 22nd or the 23rd, I was waiting 
for...for a wagon to come and pick me  up. 
 

E: And that's when you started to... 

 

T: And I was so much impr essed of the bomb
ardme nt, of the fire what was all along Kovno 
and of the first already Lithuanian fascists, goi
ng from various parts 
of the city. So I was 
overwhelmed and I couldn't help it, but I took 
the first sheet of paper that was in the 
steetle and I wrote. I have it with me. 
 

E: In your brother-in-law's house. 

 
T: My...my sister's home. My olde
st sister, Botcha. My
 oldest sister Botc
ha she was to me  
like...I was the youngest and she was the olde
st. She never allowed me ...when I studied 
Kovno University in the law school, she neve
r allowed me  to live some where else and 
take a room. I had to live with her. And fort
unately was so attached to me  we were like 
brothers. He was...he was not a 
Zionist at all. He was a left
 wing. He was from the– This 
this is not...and that night I started 
a diary. The diary I wrote 4 pages. 
 
E: Fourpages. 

 

T: And this was the fi rs
t entry of the diary. 
 

E: Which you finished 3 or 4 years later. 

 

T: And then I couldn't already stop it. So I...I
 escaped from...from the town and I couldn't  go 
far that. It wa s 100 kilome ters on a bicycle 
of course. And when I came  back it was a 
terrible thing and then...and then I heard 
that the house of the chief Rabbi there are 
gathering the leaders of the Jewish co
mmunity. And I was always, you know, had a 
interest in... in...in life of th
e students in the Youth Moveme nt, sports moveme nt so I 
went there to listen what's ...what '
s going on. And then...then...uh...then...uh...the 
Germans, the...the...the Committee, the Jewi
sh Co mmittee was formed to transfer...to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315  
12 
 
arrange for the transfer of the regular, norma l, 
as far as possibl e transfer of the Jews from 
Kovno to the ghetto. And then there was an orde
r in the...in the lst 
of August, I think. 
 
T: Yes. 

 

E: There was an order that the Jews 
should nomination...nomi nate an Oberjude. 
 

T: Let me  track back. You...you me t your father then
 and we will come  to the in a mo me nt.  
 

E: Yes. But this was after the... Can I interru
pt for 5 mi nutes. I must go in a certain place 
where the Ki ng goes by foot. (Long Pause.)   
 

E: So we were about...the Germans or dered we
...that the Jews nomi nate a Oberjude, a chief 
Jew, and we...uh...the...and it should be done in...
in a ma tter of days. So on the 4th of 
August 1941, uh... the...the activist of the 
Jewish community in Kovno called an 
assembly which was the last assembly of th
e Jewish community in Kovno at the 4th of 
August 1941 at the school, and the...on the 
agenda was an election...election of a 
Oberjude, and this was the most dramatic a
nd the most...uh... the most historic assembly 
in the history of Jews in Lithuania. Head
ed the assembly was the veteran co mmunity 
leader, Wolf, and he introduced the people w
ith the situation that it was never such a 
horrible situation, that Jews ar
e being killed in the streets, they are in ma sses being 
dragged from the houses and stores to the...to
 the prisons or to the forts. Jewish women 

are being publicly raped in 
front of their husbands and so
 far and it is a situation 
that...uh...we are on br ink of perdition, never was such a situation in Kovno, and in this 

situation, we are called to elec
t, they say nominate, but we
 say we will elect, not an 
Oberjude, not a chief Jew, but the head 
of the Jewish community and...uh...nobody of the 
assembly...there were dignitaries, people who 
were me mbers of the parliame nt, of the 
Lithuanian parliame nt, of heads of the Je
wish institutions, l
ong standing community 

leaders, not one of them wanted to get th
e nomination of a a Oberjude, because we had 
already the experience of the 
day of the Jewish Oberjude, Dr., who was a community 
leader of standing, of high standing, and he didn'
t want to fulfill the task to being a tool in 
the hands of the Germans and he committed suicide. So not one and they still ma ke the 

assembly.... So then stood up an unknown Rabbi at that time  from a– and he stood up 

and he said everybody wanted Dr
. Elkes to be the...to be he
ad of the community. But he 
didn't want to do it because he said he
 had no municipal experience. He had no 
experience. He is a physician a
ll his lifetime, and he would not
 take the responsibility for 
leadership of the community which the German
s said it would be a muni cipality in the 
ghetto that the Jews would be able t ma nage
 the all things. But Dr. Elkes said he has 
ﬂŁno...never had the experience of a municipa
l position. But everythi ng thought that Dr. 
Elkes would be the most appropriate because
 of hi s being the pr
ivate physician of the 
German a mbassador like of ma ny other am
bassadors. And we thought that this 
relationship, special relationship between 
Dr. Elkes as the private physical of the 
American...of the German ambassador 
would be helpful in perhaps ma king 
certain...uh....certain verdicts or certain ed
icts more...more huma ne. Of c ourse, it...it 
turned out as we all know but Dr. Elkes flatly
 refused to become  the...the Oberjude and 
then said for them you'll be a Oberjude. Fo
r us, you will be the respected head of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315  
13 
 
Jewish community  and you will with God's 
help we'll all go with you hand in hand. And 
this . Those who are going in a mi ssion can neve
r be helped, and with God's help we'll go 
with you. You will lead us and bring us out from
 the ghetto which is a and to bring us to 
the home of Israel and the 
spirit in the...in the whole 
was such tension and the 
hopelessness that the people just expected
 that the deadlock that came should 
some ...come  out and then after the speech, the most moving speech of Rabbi everybody 

was in tears. And then he stood up, Dr. Elkes, and he said, "If you all think that it mu st be 

I, I am here. I am here." That means I am the victim. This is exactly the words, this is 

exactly what we...what we assume d this. And 
then there was a relief and each one stood 
up and...and shook hands with Dr. Elkes a
nd greeted him and...and wished him...uh...a nd 
then three young lawyers, Dr. and myself, stoodup and we went to Dr. Elkes and we told 

them we are young lawyers and now we place our
self to your disposition, and will be at 
any time whatever you may think we can 
do, we will do and will go. We  help to you 
service. And he thanked us very muc h and he
 was pale like... like the wall. He was very 
much move d but he...everybody was sure th
at he's...here is a ma n that...uh...placed 
hims elf to the...the disposal of the dev
il actually. And then 
his deputy was elected, 
Garfunkel who was a me mber of the parliame nt
 and ﬂ Ł was elected as the chief of the 
police. Now this was the fi rst meeting with 
Dr. Elkes. The next day then...from then 

they...you already used to come  to the offices of the commission for the transfer 

committee, where they transferred the Jews
 to the ghetto which was in the...in the 
municipality building 4or 5 k
ilome ters I say 3 miles away from Dr. Elkes's house and 
street. And...uh...a day after, one of the three la
wyers of us that we volunteered to help, 
he was killed on the streets while going from
 his home to...to the 
and we were...and then 
there also thousand me n were kill
ed in one day in the street of
 the 6th of August. It is 2 
days after the election and also the thing 
was community did a–also was killed and 
we...we were very much impressed and unde
r...under...scared of what's  going on. So 
when Dr. Elkes, when he finished the work...t
he day he worked in the community in the 
committee for the transfer, I felt I cannot le
t Dr. Elkes go himself to his home . Because 
some thing can happen at the...at the street b
ecause the Lithuanian departme nt didn't ma ke 
any distinction. Dr. Elkes or no Dr. Elkes. 
A Jew! So I offe red him to accompany, to 
escort him to...to his home . He said, "Under 
no circumstances. It's  dangerous. Go...go to 
your home."  I said, "Dr. Elkes, I am a spoke
sma n and I will escort you to your home . 
You are now the chairman of the committee. I 
am one of the secretaries and I am duty 
bound to accompany you...to accompany you." But he 
didn't want. I nevertheless escorted 
him. And I came, you know, I thought if some
thing happens we...I could signal to of 
some thing happen that the partisans arrest, th
ey can arrest Dr . Elkes. And luckily we 
came...we c a me  to the home  of Dr. ELkes 
and there we saw on the sidewalk stood  
a truck with German We irmacht offi cer...offi cers and soldiers, so Dr. Elkes told me , 
"Thank you very much. You can go." I said, "No,
 I want to....I don't like this...this truck. I 
want to go up and see what is in your
...in your apartment." And we went up on the 
second floor...I think it was the third floor
...the second floor, the apartment of your 
parents and there we saw German high
 officers are going around the rooms and 
looking...looking on the...on the pain
tings in the...in the ...betw
een us the...the vases or 
crystal and so on and...and Dr. Elkes in his wisdom...I couldn't unde
rstand, but later I 
understood. He went...he went and he says to 
the officer, " Gentleme
n...Officer, You like 
this painting, take it. You like this one?  
Pl ease have it. You like this...uh....this set of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315  
14 
 
porcelainﬂ have it? Take it. And they didn't... he
 didn't have to say twice. Then he ordered 
me  I should take it and I should bring 
it down to the truck. So I went up and 
down...uh...brought the paintings, all kinds. They ...they...they took all the best things out 
of the apartment, and then...uh...when I went down the last time  Dr. Elkes accompanied 

me  and he a sked them to let me  go home . So they said, "No, I should load the truck and 

accompany them to their place where the Germ
an...at their apartment and I should reload, 
you know, from the truck to the apartment. And 
it didn't help Elkes's said he has a wife, 
he has a family. Let hi m go. He worked all the day.  He's the secretary of the committee. 

Nothing! Anyhow, I...I went until I brought...I we
nt with the truck with the officers to 
their apartment, took it off, 
and I asked them they should give me  a certificate that I 
worked that day for them so I can have a fr
ee passage to my home, that the Lithuani an 
partisans, should not take me  under arrest, but
 they didn't. So anyhow I came  safe home  

and I called imme diately. Dr. Elkes said th
ank you and thank God I'm back home . And 
your mother was so nervous and she's so upset that because of them I had to be in trouble. 

Anyhow, this was the first time that I me t a
nd I made acquaintance in a certain very 

systematic special circumstances of that time.
 ﬂ  I used to meet him every day in the 
Council. And then...uh...I used to write the diary 
and next day I used to give to Dr. Elkes 
to read it. Now I knew of all these encounter
s meeting were...there was a...a...and the fi rst 
time 3 days after we went into the ghetto. We nt
 into the ghetto the 15th of August. On the 

18th of October...of August, they or de red that
 500 academics, doctors, so they worked for 
them in the archive. So he said of 500 cam
e 534 and the very same  day they took them 
out of the ghetto and they killed them. Dr
. Elkes didn't let one st
one unturned, and he 
went to Jordon who was the of the... He wentto the chief of the Gestapo, and he insist 

that he as chairman of the Jewish Comm
ittee mu st know where are these 534 who didn't 
come...they took them  from the ghetto for arch
ives one day and they didn't  come  back. 
And he...for weeks and weeks, he went from 
one  top Gestapo to the ot her until the came 
to the chief of the Gestapo, Yeager, and th
ey told him always told him tomorrow, 
tomorrow and tomorrow  never came and until they said that the Jews make the sabotage. 

They walked with sugar and they put the ga
soline in the sugar. That's why they were 
killed. This was the first encounter, and then
 there's the second one was in the ghetto. 
There were two...uh...gynecologists Dr. who was 
the head of the gynecology departme nt 
in the ghetto and Dr....uh...Dr. Borshen. Both succeeded in escaping from the ghetto and 

they found some  hiding in the cities. But you 
know not all the Lithuanians were kin and 
were...and they were...to cut a long story, so th
ey were...they were the Lithuanians gave 
them... disclosed them to the Gestapo and they
 were arrested. And then Dr. Elkes started 
his...his emergency actions. In all directions as
 I said before, and then he came to the...to 
the chief of the Gestapo, Yeager
, and they told them they a
rrested the two Jews, the two 
doctors, and they arrested also the Lithuanian who gave them refuge. And he went to the 

chief of Gestapo, and he told them, " These ar
e the two doctors that 
are mostly needed in 
the ghetto because there is an order from
 the Ges t apo that...uh...pregnancies should be  
forbidden. It is forbidden. And they exac
tly had to act as gynecologists to cut off 
their...and make abortions. And they are so need
ed in order to comply
 with the order of 
the Gestapo, this is what...what...what he...he
 convinced the Gestapo because they did it 
not because  they are doctors to...to the good of
 the inmates of the ghetto because to fulfill 
the order of Gestapo that forbidden pregnancy. 
And he says, "I assure you that this was a 
one-time pe ople in stress." And they said, "Alrig
ht, they should go...first of all, they said 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315  
15 
 
Dr. should go. He said, "He 
himself wouldn't do. There ar
e 30,000 people in the ghetto. 
They needed  too. Alright and said...when 
they stood up, Yeager, and they thought they'r e 
finished with him. So Dr. Elkes said, "No, you 
are chief. ﬂ I have a
nother. I cannot leave 
you before I ask you also for the release of th
e Lithuanian. The Lithuanian who was held. 
He said, "What have you to do with the L
ithuanian?  You are a Jew?  The Lithuanian 
didn't take any money and he has done it for 
huma nitarian grounds and it would be for us 
a very permanent ﬂ blow, morale blow on the 
whole Jewish that a Lithuanian who gave 
refuge to Jewish...to Jews from the ghetto should be arrested or should be  humiliated to 
that because of the Jews. And he influenced
 the chief of the Gestapo, Yeager,  you see, 
"It is not good. You have him also. Let him 
out." So the Lithuanian...so the Lithuanian 
then came to Dr. Elkes and he kissed his hands, said  to do so. But the... the...the all the 

Lithuanians in the city spoke about it that 
a Jew in the ghetto brought
 about the release of 
a Lithuanian who kept...this is most rema rk
able incident. And another very important 
day, terrible day, the selecti
on of 10,000 people out of the ghe
tto on the 28th of October. 
First of all, Dr. Elkes didn't want the...as I 
said before, Dr. Elkes didn't want to publish 
the announcement that Jews...the inma tes shoul
d report on the on the 28th of October. 
Because the people will understand that the Je
ws...the Jewish committee, he is guilty of 
what ma y ha ppen that we didn't know what 
was to happen that da
y. But nevertheless it 
must not be...shouldn't be a very good th
ing. So... uh...then...uh...Dr. Elkes and others 
decided they shall go and ask the ch
ief rabbi of Kovno and then went 
Garfunkel...Garfunkel and they went...uh....and my
self. And they waked the chief rabbi 

late in the evening approxima tely at 10:00 
was too late in the evening. There was a 
curfew in the ghetto. And when we came to...to the ...uh... no, Rabbi the one who asked 

Dr. Elkes, and he...when we came and  and to
ld them what...what this is about and he 
said, "Should we...in the Jewish Committee...should the Je wish Committ ee publish 

this...this order? " And we already elaborat
ed the formulas, saying that the Jewish 
Committee announces the order of the Gestapo 
that was given by the Gestapo and not in 
the name  of the committee but neverthele
ss it was not still...uh...so the Rabbi was 
awaken. He was an old ma n, a sick ma n. He wa
s in bed. He says, "I have to think about 
it. Come  to...next morning." And we...when he
 came  the next morning, he was not yet 
ready. It was ﬂ Ł, and some body looked around 
and– To cut a long story short, in the 
very end, he came to the conclusion and he said
 he found that there was...it's  too short a 
time, to cut a long story short, he said, 
"If a community, a Jewish community is in 
danger, and there is a possibili
ty that part of the community can be rescued, can be...part 
of the community and not all the communit
y, the Jewish leadership is bound to do 
everything in order to rescue the part." 
And...uh...uh... that's  why the order he says in his 
opinion, the Jewish Committee should...should pub
lish the order, more so that it says 
clearly that they are publish
ing the order of Gestapo, that
 the Jewish...the Jews should 
report. This was a great thing. And then on 
the 28th of October at 6:00, there was a 
ma rch. The ma rch I...I write in my...in my di
ary in my opinion it was the march, a funeral 
that they...those the victims are ...are themselves
 participated in their own funeral. That is 
how it looked like. In the morning 6:00 it 
was dark, and Dr. Elkes stood...oh yeah, the 
stood on some  hill and looked around and could 
see all the scene and with his fingers 
lifted left, right, left right, Jews were sure
 that the right is th
e good sign. So they...they 
turned to the right and they even some
times say...say, "Thank you. Thank you deeply for 
your graciousness." And to the left was th
e good sign. He stood up and Dr. Elkes stood 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0315  
16 
 
and close, not far away from hi m and when there was a special hardship for a family to 
be...to be apart...torn apart or some ...or fo
r reasons, there was a ma n like who was a 
veteran Zionist leader and so on, so he aske
d this ma n is needed...w
e needed a carpenter 
for the...for the building of 
the airport and so on, and he could rescue ma ybe 10, ma ybe 
15, ma ybe 20, but he stood on his legs. He 
didn't sit down. We brought him a chair and 
he didn't sit down. It's a terrible thing that 
they...why did I have to live up...my...over this, 
to see this...this sin. And all 
the day-long from 6:00 in the morning til 7:00 in the evening 
when everything was gone and 10,000 were take
n out of the election, of the selection 
and...uh... this was a great...the greatness of 
a ma n who stood in the hardest day in the 
ghetto and he tried to do his utmost to 
...to ...to rescue whom he could. That was 
another... 
 

E: I ma y just ask you. Then he went to the sm
all ghetto to try to re scue a 100 people too, and 
then he was beaten up. 
 

T: It...at night, people came to his home and sa
id my...my...my wife was taken, my husband 
was taken, my son was taken. So he didn't
...uh...he asked  to go to and asked him to 
get...allow a permission to go into this
 small part of the ghetto where the 10,000 
were...were...were concentrated and this permi
ssion to take out very hard cases. And he 
had the permission and so he went the ne
xt morning to that small ghetto. He and 

...uh...we escorted him, and myself, but we 
didn't...we are not allowed to go...to pass 
the...the sma ll ghetto. Only hims elf. And then
 only he went in... in to the me ss. They 
were all already in rows on their way to the 
Ni nt h for t r e s s ,  whi c h i s
 the fortress of death 
where they are finally executed and when th
ey saw Dr. Elkes one took him by his sleeve. 
The other one took him by his coat. The othe
r one took him by his...by this head. ﬂ Ł 
Rescue us. Rescue us, Dr. Elkes.
 He had the...the...the list of
 the people, but then the...the 
Lithuanian partisans were escorted this groups
 of 100s. They didn't let him, and they told 
him that he should leave imme diately. It 
was a...there was a di
sorder of all the 
ma rch...was disorder, and they told him that 
you should get out. Otherwise, they'll take 
him to the Ninth fortress. But he didn't m
ove. So t hey gave him...they hit him on the 
head, and he fell and fainted and gently we r
un back from the other side of the ghetto and 
we took him to a closed home  ...uh... on the othe
r side, and there he stayed for 2 days 
because he was beaten all terribly beaten 
and bl ood, and it wa s a terrible situation and 
to...to...to the great...to the great mo urning 
of 10,000 victims , we had thought that Dr. 
Elkes got from it should not...should not come  
up on his feet again and to go on the 
leadership. Another one was.... 
 

E: Yes. Yes. You ma y want to talk about ot
her conversations to w
ith, particularly with 
Gerker.  
 

T: Yes. Now when the ghetto was about to be li quidated, Elkes always tried to talk first of 
all with Giding. There was a General Giding, who 
was the head of the greatest slave work 
site, the building of a mi litary airport . Five
 thousand Jews from the ghetto went day in, 
day out, 24 hours an day there, and there was a 
terrible, terrible situation for the people. 
Slavery where people couldn't stand it, and 
it was the head of this big enterprise 
construction was a General Giding, to whom
 Dr. Elkes went. He...he...he finally...Dr.

Giding respected very high Dr. Elkes and from time to ti me  he used to get to free to 
release a group. Not only one, a group of peopl
e, and he said, "I'll send employees from 
the Jewish Co mmittee to replace them so 
they cannot work all the time." And this 
relationship was also a special relationshi
p with Ar mond, the German...the German...the 
German director of the labor exchange in 
ghetto. He was and he...he was not a Hitler ma n 
and he used to speak with Elkes in private. Come  to him at home and tell him, "Listen, 

Dr. Elkes don't do this. Don't do that or they'r
e expecting so, and this was the ma n that we 
wrote after the...after the war, 
let us to the German courts th
at they should not shoot him. 
And finally he dared to talk to
 a chief of the Gestapo or the 
chief of the or to a chief of 
any chief of the Germans. And he dared. This
 was his strength. He
 said, "I have my 
60...over 65 years behind me , and nothing can happ
en to me . He kept in his small pocket 
always poison and he said if worse come s to 
worse, I will not fall in their hands and I'll 

take...I'll take poison in the last mo ment." 
And this is exactly what happened. It could 
have happened when they took Dr
. Elkes to the 9th fortress. 
Before...when...uh...when...before the liquidation of
 the ghetto, the Germans arrested all 
the me mber s of the Altestenrat. And they brough
t him to the Ninth fortress. It was in July 
1944. And they...Dr. Elkes was released imme diatel
y the first, but he didn't  want to be 
released until the Garfunkel, and Goldberg, a
nd the others be released. But it didn't help. 
They took him out. But when they let him go, when they brought him back into the 

ghetto, he immediately went to the ch
ief of the Gestapo, Yeager and he 
said...uh...command them please I wa rn you. This 
is what he said. I warn you. Garfunkel, 
my assistant, my deputy, and Goldberg, the me
mber of the Altestenrat, they gave them 

portions of portion before they went to the 
Ninth fortress. He divi
ded. He took his portion 
of poison and gave one part to hims elf, one 
part he gave Garfunkel and Goldberg, and he 
said, "If they will torture, you...you have the...the way out. And he said, "I am afraid 

when they continue talking them on the 
Ninth fortress my closest friend, the most 
respected former me mbe r  of parliament, Ga
rfunkel, can commit suicide, and you have to 
rescue hi m. You cannot keep him there. I 
or der...I'll commit you at your place. And this 
is how he got the release of
...of Garfunkel and of Goldberg
 and all of the rest. This 
is...and...and then before the liquidation, he
 had a...dared to speak to was a ma ss 
murderer. He  was the liquidator of many 
ghettos in Poland. When he came  to...to the 
ghetto of Kovno, first of all he...he convert
ed it to a concentration camp. And then 
he...he...uh...he...uh... actually took all the rights 
and all the...the...what the ghetto 
community had to do, the Committee was absolu
tely powerless. They had no right to do 
anything. They were not permitted anymore to give ...have contacts with the civil 
authorities. And then it went...and the had 
to...to...and here the Red Army was already 
come  closer every day to Lithuanian, and it 
was expected that everyday they mi ght come 

to Kovno, but Gerker had a order that he
 should...the remnants of the ghetto, 
approxima tely 7,000 Jewish...Jews, that they shou
ld be brought, transferred to Dachau, to 
the concentration camp i n Germany. Dr. 
Elkes commandant. You know like I know that 
the Germans lost the war. It's now only a ma tter or days or weeks. You can save your 

own honor and your own life by postponing the tr
ansfer of the remnants of the ghetto 
Kovno to Germany 4 days. And this will be no
t a rescue of your own life and your own 
honor, but this will be  also a gest ure for th
e...for your people ...for your German people. 
And...uh...we will see to it that after the war,
 you will not be  br ought to...to punishme nt 
and so on. If it...there was not any single ma
n, not in the Kovno ghetto, not in any other

ghetto in...in Lithuania or in Po
land that dare speak to a li
quidator of the ghetto the way 
he spoke because they could just wi
th one...with one finger on his...on...on...on his 
bayonet it would kill him. But Elkes dared. And 
then he said to him, "For the first time a 
German approached a Jew saying, "Herr...M
r....Dr. Elkes. I understand you well. But I 
am...I know...I agree that we 
lost the war. But I am a Ger man officer, and I am duty 
bound to fulfill orders. And it ma y what happen I 
must do my...fulfill my  task. But I'll see 
to it that you'll brought to a special...special
 train. This is secondary. But the very 
approach of Dr. Elkes showed only a very mo
re strength that not one in any Jewish 
community of the ghetto dared, and that's  why 
Dr . Elkes is the only 
Jewish leader whose 
name  was praised after the... 
after the liberation by the Firs
t Zionist World Congress in 
Basil that convened in December 1946 and it was from a very great honor to hear from 

the podium of the World Congress that was dedi
cated totally to the Holocaust to...that Dr. 
Elkes was the only one of Jewish leaders of
 the ghetto that he was praised for his 
behavior, for his courage for his...for his...for
 all what he has done and for all that he 
stood for. Now there was also...I must....before
 anything, I must say my last...my last... 
my last...my last meeting with Dr. Elkes at 
a tiny house of Miriam 
and Dr. Elkes in the 
ghetto before my escape from the ghetto. It ha
ppened so that un...unexpe
cted at all, I had 
to escape from the ghetto and Pnina, my pr
esent wife, arranged it without even telling 
me . And when I got word that a wagon will co
me  to take  me  out from Kovno to a farm 
50, 40 kilometers far away, of course, I came to
 Dr. Elkes and I told him this and we sat 
at his home from let's say 8:00 in the evening....there was present Dr....Dr. Elkes and 

Miriam Elkes and Garfunkel, the very high resp
ected deputy and they were great friends. 
And when I told them about my plans to go to...to run away from the ghetto, which was 

as I said before already c
oncentration camp, they said...G
arfunkel said, "Go?  What do 
you think?  It's  a concentration camp. How do you go out?  Wh o'll let you go out?  They 

kill you on the mo ment when any part of the ...the  barbed wire you'll try to squeeze 
through, they'll kill you." And we had the...the
 example of who was head in the ghetto 
when he was caught in the... Don't do it. You 
are going to do a...a suicide. It's  absolutely 
suicide. I beg of you. You have a wife. Y
ou have fa mily. Don't do it. This was the 
approach of Garfunkel, and it was correct to hi
s character. This was exactly as he felt as 
he saw it. Ve ry, very honest ma n. Very great 
friend of mi ne. A great 
friend of Dr. Elkes. 
And then Dr. Elkes says, "Goebel." My name
 was "Goebel.ﬂ He took me  in his hand and 
he says, "Go. If you would be my son, I would tell you go. Because you are the only one 
who knows better than anybody else
 in the ghetto what expire
s in the ghetto. Because you 
have written a diary da y in day out. And I 
know each entry of your diary which you read 
before me  e very morning what you have writte
n the former, the previous night. And this 

has to be...to reach the outer world. So your
 escape is a mi ssion, and I am sure...I know 
you...I know your courage and I believe and I am sure you...you will succeed in escapi ng 

from the ghetto. And in...in the last mo ment 
he took out from his dr
awer a letter which 
was a list will to his childre
n, Yuill and Sarah Elkes in London. He loved them. And he 
gave it to me. And he said, "This, I'm 
sure you'll succeed in your mi ssion, and you'll 
give...and over this my last will and testam
ent to my son and to my daughter and they 
should have from you our intimate friend, th
e firsthand information of what expired, 
when I wrote this my last  letter and what is
 there. Nothing could encourage me  more to 
dare and to escape from the ghetto. When I 
left at 2:30...at mi dnight after embracing Dr. 
Elkes and kissing Miriam Elkes and Miriam El
kes looked at me  and she listened to Dr .

Elkes and I could...she...she didn't say a word, 
but her eyes said everything. (long pause, 
crying). So This was 
a relationship none....
