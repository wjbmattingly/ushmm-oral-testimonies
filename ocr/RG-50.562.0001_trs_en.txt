Beginn ing Tape One 
 
Question: Good mo rning, 
Jack. 
Answer: Good morning. 
Q: Nice to see you here. 
A: Likewise. 
Q: Thank you. 
Jack
, wh at was your name when you were born? 
A: My name was 
Jurgen Jakob Bassfreund
. The name 
Jakob
 was given to me as a 
Jewish name because my grandfather™s na
me -- he w-was a rabbi with a title of a 
docto r, and he -- his name was 
Jakob Ba ssfreund
. And s-since he was deceased 
already when I was born, I -- this was give
n to me as a middle name, as a Jewish 
name, so to speak. 

Q: Right. And 
Jurg en
, where does that co
me  from, do you know? 
A: Well
 Jurgen
 is -- I don™t know how my mother ev
er got the idea. My father said, 
ﬁHow co -- what happens if he really 
looks Jewish, and you give him the name  
Jurg en
, and he will find out 
[indecipherable]
 look Jewish, and he can™t be named 
Jurgen.ﬂ Jurgen
 is actually a Danish name, I believe, it™s -- it -- it™s a na -- 
George
 in 
Danish, or something to that effect. 
Q: And did they call you
 Jurg en
? 
A: No, they used to call me 
Bubchen
, which means little boy. 
Q: 
Bubchen
?

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oh, it™s a -- it™s near

A: Well, yeah. 
Q: It™s on the river. 
A: It™s called 
Bernkastel 
on the 
Mo sel
. 
Q: I see. 
A: Yeah. And it™s very famous for its wines.
 In fact, you can almost go in every per -- 
pe -- wine store here in this 
country , and you™ll find wine from 
Bernkastel
. 
Q: Right. Did you grow up in 
Bernkastel
, or in -- or in -- 
A: No, not in 
Bernkastel
 proper. We lived about two m
iles, or three miles out of 
Bernkastel
, in a small village I would say, it™s called 
Mu h lh eim. 
That™s where we 
lived, that™s where my 
father™s practice was.

Q: A medical doctor. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: So how come you were born in 
Bernkastel
? 
A: Well, this -- when my mo
ther gave birth to my  sist

ashamed to give birth at the hou -- in the 
house, and this was the only hospital around, 

was in 
Bernkastel
. It was a Catholic hospital, I rememb er there were all nuns there. 
And also my  father used to have his patient

 also did surg ery.

A: I -- removing -- a-a-appendectomies, and 
operations of that kind. Heart operations 
weren™t done in those days -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- days, so -- 
Q: So how did you find 
out that that was the reason why you were born in 
Bernkastel
? 
A: Because my mother told me.

a very loving father. He --

Q: Yeah? 
A: -- I must say, yeah. And my father 
used to put, let™s 
say, for instance 
Lindt
 
chocolates on our night tables, 
an d things like that. He was a very good father. He was

very -- he was a good man, too, he had -- I 
remember I ha -- ga -- my father used to 
also buy -- when I bought a pair -- he bo
ught a suit for me, he would also buy the 
chauffeur™s son a suit, and he used to bu
y schoolbooks for -- for him and for me. A 
very good man. 
Q: So he was a generous man. 
A: In fact, I understand that there were 
underp riv -- some o-of his underp rivileged 

patients, who didn™t even have any electr
icity, that my father
 used to put -- put 
electricity, and had it charged to him, beca
use he had to  see wh
at he was doing, you 
know, and besides that, he felt that people 
have got to have electricity, you know? 

Q: So he was a genero
us person? Generous? 
A: He -- 
Q: He -- he was generous. 
A: Yeah, very generous. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Very generous man. 
Q: Did he have a good sense of humo r? 

A: Oh yeah, he did. 
Q: Is that where you go
t your sense of humor? 
A: I guess so. I guess I have a pretty decent sense of humo r. 
Q: Now, did he have in  -- his office was in 
Muhlheim?

A: Yeah. He had his office in 
Muhlheim
, and he moved in -- I think it was 1930, yeah, 
he moved into a new house, we had a 14 
room house, and th e practice was in that 
build ing, on the side entr
ance, and there was the -- 
Q: I see. 
A: -- was the practice there. 
Q: So, did you go fo r walks with 
your father, or did you build  -- 
A: Oh yes I did. 
Q: Yeah? 
A: My father had very little time, because duri
ng ha -- in those days doctors used to do 
house calls, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: It wasn™t like today, the only doctor came in the house is
 Dr. Pepper.
 But in those 
years, they -- my father was 
called out day and night. In 
fact, we had a telephone line 
going direct to the chauffeur™s house, and if 
my  father had to go somewhere, he would 
ring up, and he would come 
and pick him up wi-with the car and take him to the 
patient. 
Q: Now, I understand that your father was 
not the best driver, is that why he had a 
chauffeur? 

A: Oh yeah, he was a horrible driver. I don™
t -- I never drove with him, but maybe I 
wouldn™t be here today if I would have. My  
mother said that he drove once, and that

he almo st ended up in a ravine, or somethi
ng. And she said, ﬁYou can™t drive no mo re, 
this is it.ﬂ She said, ﬁYou better hire somebod
y to,ﬂ -- because in the beginning, when  
my father first started 
out, he used to go to 
[indecipherable]
 day he had to go to the 
woods there, and things like that
 -- they had wild boars in 
that area too, you know, in 
the woods. So it was kind of a risky situa
tion. And it™s better to go by car, you know -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- than walking. 
Q: So does this mean that you we
re fairly wealthy, because you had -- 
A: Ba -- by American standards, I don™t thi
nk that my father was very wealthy. I mean, 
we didn™t have a -- a yacht in the ocean, or 
anything like that. My father was very hard 
work ing man, and he very se
ldom took a vacation. I rememb er even wh en my  mo ther 

was -- would take us on vacations to the 
Black Forest
, or most of the time we used to 
go out of -- out of the country,
 because there was a lot of 
anti-Semitism, especially in 
do -- in places near the -- near the 
North Sea
 where the Germans had 
the ba -- the ba -
- spas, and places. The fact was th at the Jewish newspaper in 
Germany
 used to print 
every year a book that have places where 
Jews are not wanted. And they listed all 
these restau rants and hotels that 
did not cater to Jewish people.  

Q: And this is before 
Hitler 
came? 
A: Yeah, that was before.

Norderney

is it on the b -- I think it™s on the 
Baltic
. And -- or maybe it™s on the 
North Sea, 
I™d -- I™m not sure now. And they never 
allowed Jews in -- 
in that town.  
Q: Wh-W hat was your father™s name? 

A: 
Manfred, M-a-n-f-r-e-d, Manfred Bassfreund
. 
Q: And was -- was he equally doti

A: Oh yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- he was close to both of you? 

A: Yeah, yeah, definitely. 

Q: What -- uh-huh. Was he interested in music? 
A: Oh yeah.  
Q: Yeah? 

A: Very much so. I remember
 th at -- I remember the old 
Ca ruso
 records that we had. 
In those years, used to have a 
crank tha -- a crank up phonograph. 
Q: Right. 

A: It was a

Caru so
 records, he had symphonies, 
but in those days the symphonies came, ea ch movement was on a separate record, of 

course. So I™m -- I remember we had 
Beethoven™s 
First, the first 
movement, and we

had the opera recordings, so 
of course tha -- in those days you didn™t have comp lete 
operas. There were arias, or duets
, or so on and so forth, yeah. 
Q: So you grew up as 
a youngster hearing a lot of classical mu sic? 
A: Oh yeah, I did, I did. 
Q: And did he teach -- did 
-- did you listen together an
d he taught you about the 
music?  
A: Yeah, he taught me about the mu sic, a
nd we listened together. And he also -- I 
reme mb er in those years, in 1932, came out
 for the first time, a German encyclopedia 

in one volume, 
A
 to 
Z
, and it was a very good one, was wa -- well made, and he gave 
it to me. A nd I used to love to look
 up things when I list -- listened to 
Verdi
, I would 
look up
 Verdi
. When I was listen ing to 
Meyerbeer
, I would look up 
Meyerbeer
. And 
I learned a lot from it, you know? I -- 

Q: Did you also listen to 
popular music, or it  was strict l y  classical  music?  
A: No, I would say strictly classical -- I™m 
still to -- well -- I™m s
till today not a great 
friend of -- of popular music. 
I mean, my wife is a big enth
usiast of jazz, and you can 

ask her almost anything, she can tell you when  
Lo uis Armstro ng
 had a headache, 
almost, but my -- I am not rea

Q: Mm-hm. Did you go to concerts 
as a kid, were there concerts in 
Muhlheim

Q: Yeah? 
A: In fact, that this is the on

Germany

little town had an opera house there. 
Q: Really? 
A: In 
Trier
 has an opera house, I mean all tare -- 
also used to give plays in that but 
they -- but we had to -- I remember a ber 
-- a -- a gentleman, we were friendly, my 
sister was friendly with his daughter, he was a

heldentenor 
is 
somebody who does the Wagnerian waltzes, 
the real stro ng voice, tenor, you know. 

You have to be for 
Wagner.

Q: And tell me something about y
our mother, what was she like? 
A: My -- my mother was -- I was not as close 
with my mother as wi
-with my father, I -
- I can truly say. I think my  mo ther was not
 as patient and as l
oving a person as my  
father was. But of course
 she was my mother, you kno
w, and you have no -- no 
options why -- 
Q: Right. 

A: So, I can™t say anything bad about her, but
 I sh -- remember my 
father more fondly 
th an  my  mo th er. 

Q: Was she a disciplinarian? 

A: Yeah, among other things, yeah . 
Q: What are the other things? 
A: You know what, I -- what 
I mean to say is just, in 
Euro pe
 wh en  a wo man  is 
married to an 
MD,
 she has the feeling as if she™s part an 
MD
 as well, because the 
woman is usually called 
Frau Doktor
, which is stupid because she™s not a doctor, not 
at all. My mother Wa -- didn™t -- ma -- my 
mother was not stupid, but she didn™t have 
the brain capacity to be a doctor. And this isn™t -- she used to walk around, you can see

even, in one picture. She used
 to  have wh at is called an 
esculap
, I don™t know whether 
you know what an 
esculap 
is. An 
esculap
 is a snake winding ar
ound -- I think was a 
sign of a doctor. And she had a brooch with  a 
diamond in it that she always wore. So 
you would know that she had something 
to  do with th e medical profession.  
Q: But she didn™t work? 
A: No, no. She didn™t work. 

Q: Yeah. And did th ey get 
along okay, your parents? 
A: This was the bad part about it, because 
since she didn™t work , she could dedicate 
more time of this discipline 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did your mo ther and father get along, 
do you th ink? From what you rememb er? 
A: Yes, to a certain extent. My mother was 
a little bit on the jealous side, and so on, so 
-- but this is not neither here nor th ere. 

Q: Right.  

A: I mean, I think sh e™s not the only one. 
Q: Right, right. And how ab out your sister

reminisce, whatev

Q: Did you play together? 

A: Oh yeah, sure, sure. 

Q: Yeah? 
A: Sure. 
Q: Because often when the -- when you have a 
si -- a sister or brother who is a couple 
of years older, they don™t want to ha

A: No, I loved -- my sister always let me 
win the games, and I was very happy about 
that, so I played 
a lot with her. 
Q: Right. 

A: I remember playing with he

 dolls, and I used to play

sunlamp, or whatever. 
Q: Uh-huh, yeah. 
A: It was a big contraption a -- in those da

you had to lie down on it, and I don™t know 
how lo ng, two or three minutes, whatever, 
you had to wear goggles, you know. 
Q: And what was the purpose? 
A: I don™t think even that it™s that healt

that. 
Q: And you -- you did th at?

A: I think se -- sa -- in those years people di
d things that are abso
lutely wrong to do. I 
used to gar -- get sick very 
often because probably 
due to the fact that my father saw 
[indecipherable]
 patients, and probably so me of th
e germs carried over into  the house 
or whatever. I used to have 
a sore throat every hour, so to
 speak. And in  those years, 
when  someone had fever, they would give th
em something like aspi
rin, and then they 
would take a wet cloth, and wrap  you up in 
it, and you had to sweat in that. Which is 
wrong because it causes pe
ople to get pneumonia. 
Q: Right. 
A: And a -- I -- I remember distinctly, I had 
quite a lot of sickness when  I was a kid. I 

even had scarlet fever. 

Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. And -- 
Q: So th ey wrapped you in a wet li 
-- like a towel over your entire body? 
A: Yeah, not wa -- two or three times a day,
 yeah. And I hated -- I used to scream my 
head off, but they
 had no mercy.  
Q: No mercy. And th is was a hot to
wel, in order to make you sweat? 
A: Yeah, it was a hot towel, yeah. And it was soaking wet. 
Q: Right. 
A: And then  they put a dry one
 around it, on top of it, and 
you had to lay there, and if 
you were lucky somebody would read you a 
story, and if not, you just screamed --

Q: Did your sister get 
sick as often as you? 
A: Not as often, but she also got, once in awh

call the

Q: The 
wic kel?  
A: Because 
wickel

were wrapped 
up in  it. 
Q: I see. Did you like school? 

A: No.  

Q: Do you remember
 going to  school? 
A: No, I -- I don™t -- I liked school, but I ne
ver remember that I went to school where 
there was no anti-Semitism there. 

Q: Really? 
A: I mean, already in 1930, the Nazis ha
d a way of getting -- teach na -- national 
Socialist teachers into the 
s -- s- sc hool op -- system.  
Q: Right. 

A: And I remember th at there was a German  poem, where it was ab out a tree which 
wanted to change it™s leave, and then 
God gave him golden leaves, and when  the 

golden leaves 
[indecipherable]
, a Jew went through th e forest, and he saw the golden

leaves, and he took them all 
off in a big sack, he came in
 with a big beard and sack. 
And every time when I -- when this part of 
the ballad was supposed to be said, he -- 
the teacher would call on me to say it, you 
know? And the kids didn™t want to play 
with me any more. And when -- I remember 
even before I went to school, usually 
when  kids fought they used to call each othe
r idiot, or donkey, or ape, or whatev er. 
[indecipherable]
 called you a dirty Jew, you know? And it got worse and wo rse, of 
course, and so we had to -- in fact, I rememb
er that the school teacher I had used to 
smoke Nazi cigarettes. There was one co mp any in  germ -- you know, the Nazis always 
had for a -- for all their things, thes
e forceful names. Like, the black 
core
 was the 
SS
 
newspaper. 
Der Sturmer, 
or the storm man, you know? And the attack -- the 
[indecipherable]
 -- the attack. And these cigarettes were called 
Trommlers
, and they  
came, of course, in a brown pack ing with an  
SA
 insignia on it. And he used to  smoke 
them. I hope he got cancer from them. But he
 smoked them constantly, he was a chain 
smoker. And they infiltrated the system. 
This was -- I would say that maybe the 
National Socialists used the most -- the cl
everest way of fooling people, and getting -- 
getting th eir system working. Because they
 did it without you knowing about it, you 
were -- all of a sudden somebody appeared in
 school, he tried to get the kids to enlist 
in the 
Hitler
 youth. And then th ey used to send 
-- my father was hated by them, but of 
course, my father, every time wh
en s -- when they 
-- they -- they tried to assemble, and 
somebody would sp eak, my  father told the owne

them speak, I will tell the Jewish people no
t to buy wine from you.ﬂ And then they 
cancelled it, of course, because 
they would have lost a lot of
 money. But of
 course he 
was on -- on their black list, on their hate 
list. And I remember 
that every time when 
they used  to come and march past our hous
e, they would raise the Nazi flag high up 
for us to see it, you know? In 
other words to say, once we 
get there, we are going to 
take care of you, so to speak.

Q: So what do you mean wh
en -- when  I ask you the que

what does that mean to you? 
A: Well, I wasn™t religious, we -- I had to
 be religious. My father was fluent in 
Hebrew, and on the high holid

about a mile out of town, 
and he wo uld take over the -- the -- the part of the 
Chassan

openly in  -- in 
Muhlheim

A: Yeah, I certainly do rememb

-- two, there were thousands of people lin
ed up to see -- he
 was interred in 
Trier
 of 
course, because I don™t know, my  father said 
he doesn™t want to be buried in a Jewish 
cemetery in 
Muhlheim
, because it was out of th-thing
s -- my mother wouldn™t have 
had the ch an ces to go and visit the grave, 
and all that. So he was interred in -- in 
Trier
. 
And people lined up, because my father wa
s beloved in those ye
ars, you know? He 
had many patients, he saved many lives, and 
he was very well loved. We had also  two 
more doctors in this little horse village th
ere. One was a drunk. He had a mistress, and 
he was standing -- always going hunting with
 her in the lo -- hu
nting lodges in the 
forest. The other one was -- he was a good do -- I -- I guess he was all right, but he 
didn™t have -- my father was the busiest of 
the three, because he was always there. Not 
because he was Jewish. They

ﬁYour dad passed away,ﬂ and -- and he was -- he was crying.

 And I can truly say he™s one of the 
new
 Nazis 
that I -- now I saw him after the war, and 
he almo st got in a concentration camp 
because he went into a store and he said 
good morning. There was a woman who said, 
ﬁIt™s not good mo rn ing any mo re, it™s 
heil Hitler
.ﬂ And he said, ﬁWhat happened to 

the good mo rning?ﬂ And th at woman was 
very upset about that, you know, the

Bar-Mitzvahed,

there was a Jewish butcher, he had a very un

on a 
band
. Like, you

 in this department, he would wrap it up and it 
goes to the next department, and so on, so

Rosenthal

Der Sturmer
, he would stand in 
front of an d photograph the people. It was all done by the party, you know? 

Photograph the people going in  that store to
 make sure that no 
German would buy in 
that store. And this guy lost his business b
ecause he had a extremely busy store, and he 
had good merchandise, good meats, and ever

 no outrage in the

[indecipherable]

 worse. That was in ™36, 
the Olympic games. In ™37, well, in ™37 of

while he was dancing. That was

 then he had to go there. It was an

leather in. And on the botto m, 
there was like a pattern, this 
wasn™t a pattern, this was a 
piece of wood that was connected 
to this with a leather strap,
 so when you put your leg

and it would hold the l

sewing it.

 of material, and on 
each end you had to 
sew in a piece of string. I would s -- ma-maybe
 even say more a piece of rope, so it™s 
came to a

fact, I was so good at 
it sometimes I had to ma

had inspections there. I hadto make the -- the samples,

I had to go to the hospital, and a -- a German

pital was allowed, let™s say,
 if I were to cut my hand 
off or something, they would allow t-to 
put a bandage on, but 
you could not go to a 
German hospital. In those days
 the only vehicle I was allowe
d to take to work was the 
streetcar. And I™ll tell you what that is if 
you have an acute appendicitis and you have 
to take the streetcar from one end of 
Berlin
 to the other. Every 
time that st -- car 
started to rattle, I could -- I felt that my in

Rehfeld
 
yet, or 
Schindler. 
Who could keep up with her? A
nd -- has to ap-appear at eight 
o™clock at night at the police station. So I 
went with my mother. 
The police officer -- it 
was a statio n that no Jew want
ed to go to. It was in the 
Krollmanstrasse, 
in 
Berlin
. 
They  were non -- if you stand there waiting,
 a police wo uld come and push you, and 
you would fall, and all kinds 
of things. Well, there was this guy sitting there, and he 
said, ﬁYou -- you have a letter,ﬂ he says, ﬁw here are you from?ﬂ My mo ther says she is 
-- that she is from 
Saarbrucken
. He says, ﬁI™m from 
Saarbrucken
, too,ﬂ he says, 
ﬁwhat cr-crime did you commit?ﬂ She said, ﬁI
 gave the stamp in.ﬂ He said, ﬁScrew 
them.ﬂ He s -- tore it u p  and threw it in th
e wastebasket, said, ﬁGo home.ﬂ Was a lucky 
break. 

Q: Right. 

A: She could have gone to camp for that. Sh

that real wild ones. Ther
e were a few decent people. 
Q: Right. 

A: I™m not saying th at all of

 was bad. 
Q: Yes.

were always people that would hide them, 
that would do this, would -- would do that 
for them. Or at least ch ildren, they would ta
ke children in to hide them, or -- not in 
Germany
, you didn™t find that. 
Q: But did you -- did 
you know that in 
Berlin
 there were Jews who were hiding 
underground? 

A: Yeah, of course we knew. We didn™t kn
ow where they were. But there were Jews 
hiding. 
Q: Di-Did you think about 
that as a possibility, or -- 
A: No, I had nobody to hide me. 
Q: You didn™t know anyone to do it --  

A: No. 
Q: Right. 
A: Abso lutely not. 

Q: But certainly starting in 19
41 when they -- when
 they took you in
 forced labor, the 
deportations out of 
Berlin
 start
. 
So did you know about deportations? 
A: Deportations started in ™41, I believe. 

Q: Yes, yes. 
A: Yeah, I saw, for instance, people who had 
worked with me at 
that leather factory 
already, they went to 
Rig a

 that time, and the Germans 
occupied it, was called
 Litzmannstadt

nobody thought that 
they would go in  the gas chamber, they 
would be shot an d -- and -- and -- by th e 
hundreds and by the thou

Q: But at the same time, you certain

A: Oh no, nobody wanted to be deported.

A: I mean, after all, I mean
 you lived somewheres, you were wi -- in your house, and 
with your -- in your apartment,
 with your mo th er or with

case might be. You don™t want to 
all of a sudden be shipped to

Q: Right. Do you -- do you feel a differe

Berlin 
in ™38, and when you™re in fo
rced labor in 1941 and 1942? Do
 you feel that things are 
getting somehow wo rse? 
A: Oh yeah. You saw them getting worse,
 you didn™t have to feel it even.

two slices of bread, whatever it was. And 
you had to eat it fast, because if you didn™t

to wa -- that™s how long th

And I remember one night -- first of 
all there was -- t-they gave you a 
[indecipherable]
 pockets for people to 
urinate in. And the last one that came there, 
and it was full, had to go -- an
d nobody wanted to go and fa
 -- with the cold outside. 
So if you didn™t go -- 

Q: You had to take it outside? 

A: I go th ere once, and I figure oh, still good en ough. All of a sudden I got hit over the 
head, and the 
ka po
 was there, ﬁGet out with that da
mn  thing you son of a bitch.ﬂ And 
he threw me out, you know, 
[indecipherable]
 was kind of thing. So I figure since I™m 
in the toilet already, might as well empty 
myself completely. I sit down, all of a 
sudden I feel some -- something touching 
me on the sh oulder. I look up, there™s a guy 
hanging on the -- on the -- on th
e blankets, i -- pi -- hung
 himself, you know? And he 
was dancing on my shoulder when I was s
itting, you know? And it 
did -- did not phase 
me because it was nat -- that was a natural 
thing. I mean it™s like, if you go in the 
swimming pool, you expect to get wet, right? 
Q: Right. 

A: And when you in  -- and wh en  you™re ther
e, you expect to see th ese things, I mean, 
that -- hangings. Then they had something th
at was called sport. After work -- well, I -
- I don™t know whether I told you th at we ha
d to, when  we made 
the bunks, the bunk 
consisted of a straw mattress,
 and a -- and a wedge pillow, a very thin wedge pillow,

and a blan ket, of course. Thin blanket, to 
be sure. And in the mo
rning when  we made 
that bed, that had to be done in the militar
y fashion. There were two guys that started 
from the first bed to the last one, they ha
d th e string, and these pi -- these wedge 
pillows and the -- and that blanket, they had 
to perfectly align. There had to be a crease 
in it, you know? So that th
ey all fit in the crease 
[indecipherable]
. So I don™t know, 
we p -- goofed, or somebody goofed. I don™t know, maybe I goofed, I don™t rememb er 
exactly. That means y ou have sport. After 
they came back from wo
rk, they s -- bunks 
[indecipherable]
 so and so , you™re all going out for 
sport. Well, th e sport consisted of 
carrying a very long ladder. That ladder was al
most as long as from this end here of 
the room to the -- to this end. And each person
 had to take one of th e sprockets, one of 
the things oh -- in his should
er, we had to run across and sing, and we had to say, ﬁWe 
are supposed to be clean, we are supposed to
 make our beds right, we are not,ﬂ -- all 
this. And that went on --depends 
how -- wh at mood th ey -- they -- the 
ka po
 was. It 
was a very cold day, and he was cold himsel
f, it didn™t last as long. But on the sunny 
day, believe me, you could -- 
could go on for hours. 

Q: So you would keep 
running back and forth, singing th is song? 
A: We had to ro -- run around with it. 
Q: In a circle? 
A: Yeah, well --

 the whole camp area there.

A: Just us.

A: It was a punishment. And this was one
 of the lesser punish ments, the worse 
punishment was when they gave you 25 b
eatings, you know? They

that. 

Q: Did you ever get that? 

A: No. I was lucky. I almost got it, but it 
wa -- the Russians were coming already, they 
couldn™t do it no more, because it was a very cold
 winter, that -- that wi-winter of 1944 
and ™45. And I was wo rking outside. I was 
carrying up bricks, un
loading bricks, and 
was very co ld, so one of th

everything. So I got aw
ay with it. But in 
Auschwit z
, th ey had very -- in --in --
especially in 
Buna
, the very cruel method. Wh en I got to 
Auschwitz

kinds of ways of killing people.
 With the spades, or
 they lay them down on the ground 
on th eir stomach, and they take a -- a broom, or a -- a shovel, and the -- the -- the 
ka po  
would step on him and break th
e guys nec -- neck. All these things we had. Then we 
had to bring them in. At night we had to 
bring the dead  in, you 
know, they had like a 
little carriage there, a little wagon -- four 
wheel wagon -- two wheel wagon it was. 
And that™s where we put thecorpses in and then we had 
to -- because everybody had 
to be counted where -- there was no su ch thi
ng -- if somebody died, he had to  be laid 

out during th e roll call. 
Q: So that they could count. 
A: They would take the count, you know,
 because otherw ise how would th ey know 
that nobody escaped? 
Q: So how did you have s

to be carrying these -- 
A: Because I had done physical work all this time.

A: On th e railroad station, all o -- but even
tually, also, I lost a lot of weight, you 
know? And when  you lo se a lot of weight y
ou got to be careful because they got those 
selections in the camp. They would call a 
-- they would close the camp  up co mp letely, 
nobody can go in to  wo rk, and out of -- out 
to wo rk or anything. And th en you had to 
undress in front of the -- the shower room 
there, which was in essence a barrack with 
two doors on each end, you kno
w? And you had -- you knew what -- what this was all 
about, because we knew they
 made the selections, we ne
ver -- once you in th e camp  
you know all about it. So we had to  undress 
comp letely n -- comp letely naked, and you 
had your shoes in your hand, 
that™s all. They march you 
through that -- you had to run 
though that thing,
 and there was the 
SS
 standing, one guy had th
e cane, and he had the 
t -- the end that -- the handle end out, and if
 he saw some body that he thought was not 
able to wo rk any mo re, he would pull him 
by the neck over to 
the side, take his 
number, and he had to stand th

 speak, in -- in a different fashion. And I remember I 
walked through there, I -- y-you die a

happening there. And I used to s -- f -- take 
a deep breath, make my

Q: How -- how often did they  have selections there? Do you reme mb er? 
A: Oh, about four or five weeks. 

Q: Every -- every four or five weeks? 

A: Yeah. Sometimes they had 
it even mo re often. It all depended how the demand fo r -
- for -- for prisoners was in th
e camp. If they had an overcr
owding, then I -- I mean if 
there were too many within, 
they  figured , oh, might as well take people that are new, 
they™ve still got strength
 to do work, you know? 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And we get rid of the old ones. 

Q: So how many month were you in 
Buna
, do you think? 
A: I got there in February, I say about six 
or seven month. Torture that place was. I 
don™t know, I had some friends that 
stayed there during the whole time. 
Q: What did -- what did you -- when -- when 
you were in the barrack, or even at work, 
did you guys talk
 about anything? 
A: No, we were actually
 not supposed to talk. 
Q: You™re not supposed to talk? 

A: No. We -- we would talk though, I mean 
-- but we didn™t talk about that. That was 
not on our mind, and our mind 
was where you get this piece of bread, that -- where 
you can find potato peels, or whatever. I re
memb er we used to take potato peels, and -- 

they had in -- in 
Auschwitz

the heat in from one central poi
nt into the barracks. And we
 used to take the potato 
peels, and make a little bowl out of them, 
and roast them on there to make them hard. 
Q: That was a delicacy . 
A: It was a delicacy, it sure was. And wa
ter you couldn™t drink there because it 
contained th-th -- that typhus 
bacteria, is all k ind of things. The water was actually red 
when  it came out, I don™t know if -- 

Q: Red? 
A: Yeah. There were a lot of sh -- people that
 said that™s the blood of the Jews that™s 
running through it, but this wa
s not the case. The case was 
that the Germans must have 
bombed the water mains, and -- and probabl
y somehow the rust 
and everything went 
in there, or whatever. We kn
ew -- there were some people 
they couldn™t help it, they 
drank that water. Some of them nothing happen
ed to even, but a lo
t of them died of 
dysentery, I think it was, or to -- and then 
you used to go to bed 
after ti -- they have 
lice and fleas in this place you wouldn™t 
believe. You laid down, there was like a 
whole army  creeping over your body, you co
uld feel it. It was like a never-ending 
army  of -- of fleas and lice. You could get 
rid of them, if a flea hops, and you -- used 
to get them, you had only one shirt, you know
, you had to wear that shirt at night as 
well, in the mo rning you got up, the fleas were
 in the shirt, you had 
to go to work . It 
was terrible, it was very painfu l, because 
they bite, you know, and the -- I don™t know 
what they had to eat there, because we didn
™t have certainly nothing to eat, but they

found something. And then th
ey  -- all of a sudden they  sa
id they needed some people 
for 
Auschwitz
, and I figured, as I said, I™m not goi
ng to  exist here any longer than 
over there, so I volunteered for 
the things, I told a couple 
[indecipherable]. 
One day a 
Red Cross wagon sh owed up, I said, ﬁOh my  
God.ﬂ That™s already a bad sign, the Red 
Cross wagon were very closely associated w ith the -- with the gas chambers. Had to go 
in a -- we had no choice, we got to 
Auschwitz
. They  brought us -- 
Q: And you -- you™re talking ab out 
Auschwitz I
 now, right? 
A: Yeah, the main camp. 
Q: Mm-hm.  

A: I got in there, they pu
t me in the -- what was call
ed the hospital, it was the 
kra n kenbau, 
the building for the sick. So
 I went in there, the 
SS
 doctor comes and 
says, ﬁYou don™t look bad.ﬂ I said
, ﬁNo, I feel very good, I 
would like to go
 to  w o rk .ﬂ 
He says, ﬁGet the hell out of here,ﬂ he says
, ﬁgo to block 18.ﬂ A
nd I went to block 18 
and I was out. But some people were not th
at lucky. There were 
some of that they 
were taken right to 
Birkenau
 and they were attached to
 an incoming -- there were 
always tr -- there were always trains comi
ng in. That place was as b u sy as a -- a bee™s 
nest. You have no idea, one train went out,
 another one came in. That depends on wh at 
countries people came from. The Hungarian 
Jews came at the end, and it was a 
unusual situation with them, you probably  he
ard about it, they were treated like they 

had the families were together, that their hair 
wasn™t cut, and all of a sudden, after six,

seven months they took them all out and 
gassed them. Kids, and the -- and ev en the -- 
the -- there wa -- there was a guy that to
ld them, a Hungarian Jew there, a young 
fellow. He loved those kids and -- and a 
-- he -- I think he went -- he committed 
suicide there. 
Q: I think you™re talking about the 
Theresienstadt

Q: Fro -- from 
Theresienstadt
 -- 
A: Abso lutely. 

Q: -- you said 
Hungary
. 
A: Y-Yeah, from 
Hungary.
 And I remember that night, 
I was working th e night shift 
in 
Auschwitz
. My friend 
Itzhak Klein
, the gynecologist and I, we work ed in a 
woodwo rking factory, they made 
the beds for the -- bunks for the 
SS
, whatever. It was 
a very modern outfit. All the 
shavings, the wood shavings 
were sucked out onto a big 
pile on th e outside, there was a -- a mo tor 
that sucked the th
ing out. There were 
shavings and things. The 
SS 
used it a lot when th
ey burned Jews in
 the open pits, you 
know, to -- on a rainy day they  couldn™t star
t the fire, they would come over, we had to

139
load it up for them, you know.
 And they were the -- and one
 of them said once to me, 
ﬁDon™t take it -- don™t give me all,ﬂ he says, 
ﬁleave some for yourself.ﬂ This was a nice 
way of putting it, you know? 
Q: Was nice, wasn™t it? 
A: Well anyway, the -- I went in there, and 
that night, when the Hungarian Jews were 
driven  into the gas chamber, you could -- it 
sounded like a jungle, it was horrible. I can 
still hear it today in my ears. They were
 screaming like lions, 
like animals it sounded 
like in the jungle, you know? A 
horrible noise. But that didn™t
 help them any, they had 
to go in. So th-this was th
e -- one night they gassed and 
burned 14,000 people, can you 
imagine what the -- how many people that is? 
And later when they 
caught -- when the 
-- when the Poles caught 
up with the -- with 
Hoss
, the -- the camp commander. There 
was a 
Rudolf Hoss
, and there was a 
Rudolf Hess. Rudolf Hess 
was as deputy fuehrer, 
he does not -- I -- I™m not
 talking about -- he was already in prison in 
England 
at that 
time. I™m talking about 
Rudolf Hoss, 
the camp commander, and he said -- he said, 
ﬁWell, I c -- I couldn™t kill more people,ﬂ he said, ﬁbecause the mach inery would have 
suffered and broken down , and we couldn™t 
take that chance, we had so many mo re 
Jews to kill.ﬂ But was horrible that night, 
I remember it. We went on top -- that 
build ing had three stories, and from the third floor you could see the ovens, ya -- the 

chimneys, and the fire was coming out ther
e something -- it looked like something was 
on fire, you know, th e build ing was on fire
. Yeah. And it stank too, oh horrible,

horrible smell. It smells like if you would ta
ke a steak and you put it on a fire without -
- and it starts burning, 
you know, that flesh sm
ell. It also went in our hair, because the 
ashes -- this is very unhealthy climate up 
there, it is like they got a lot of wus -- 
stagnant waters there in that area. And 
the -- the -- the ashes, you know, the ashes 
settles because if there was 
a low ceiling, the ashes woul
d come down, and goes for 
miles. Would settle on our head, we were shav
en. Used to come back at night that we 
had a whole -- whole thing full of ashes on 
your head, you know, from the burnings. 
You couldn™t take showers there, it was onl
y one shower a week, you know, and it was 
all there was. And you just had to do 
like this, you know, till everything came -- 
Q: Till it came out. 
A: -- most of it came out. And -- 
Q: C-Can you go back for minute? When  the 
-- when th e docto r kicked you out of the 
hospital, when you first went to 
Auschwitz I
, he said go to barrack 18? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What™s barrack 18? 
A: Barrack 18 -- all -- all the barracks had numbers -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- th-the lower floor was 18, the top was 18
A, 
I think I was in 18
A
. And they  had 
the -- they had this 
up -- a -- woodworking 
thing, it was a good 
[indecipherable]
 
because at least in the wint
er you could -- you 
had to go inside, be
cause you had to

take that thing in . Wh at we did is we had 
a wo oden  box about this size, I would say, 
and this high, and it had tw
o handles on each end. And 
Itzhak Klein
 would ha -- go in 
the front, or me in the front, and he was in
 the back, we would fill this up, bring it 
inside, and use it in the heating system, they
 had central heating there. We would s -- 
put it in the ovens there, in 
the -- in the regular ovens, you 
know, to heat the building. 
And so at least you had a chan
ce -- when it was -- it™s bitter co
ld there in the winter, a 
chance to warm -- get -- get warmed a little. We 
used to go back and 
forth, and then of 
course we had to deliver some of it to the
 SS 
w h en  th ey  n eed ed  
it for the burnings 
there in the -- the open pits, be cause even though th ey  had, I think four of -- six at the 
end, I think six 
gamma -- 
gas chambers, it didn™t have 
enough facilities to burn them 
all at one time. So they -- they went again to  that system where they had these holes in 
the ground like they dug holes or 
[indeciphera ble]
 eight or 10 feet in deep, and there -
- that™s where they would throw 
the -- throw the -- the people in. 
Q: So when you say woodworking, you really mean taking pieces of wood to various 

places, so that you could heat -- 
A: They would use these -- these shavings, 
they would put some 
kind of an oil on it, 
okay,

when I worked in this
 wo odworking shop, the 
Poles, you know, are very an
ti-Semitic, and -- but they -- I mean, P o lish there was the 
main language spoken, I couldn

lucky I could -- I was able to -- to rep
eat my  number, you know, because every time 
you got bread, or you got soup, 
you had to  tell them, you know, 
106377
, and then they 
would get. So I gave them the numb er in Polish 
[indecipherable]
 they were very 
happy about that alread y. A
nd one day there was one guy, 
he was -- one Po lish guy, he 
was walking around like a
 Beau Brummel
, here, his un -- his prison garb  was tailor 
made, and he had a -- a cap that had -- wa
s hanging over there. And he say, ﬁH ey, 
what™s your number, number, number?ﬂ He c
ould hard ly speak German. So I gave him 
my  number, so he put it down. So  the othe

they™re making the transport fo

Q: So that was very lucky. 

A: That was lucky.

A: Anybody who was in this camp had to be
 lucky. If you weren™t lu cky, you are not 
here. 

Q: Right. 
A: It™s just as simple as that. 
[indecipherable]
. When you go in that camp , you have to 
complete -- your life has to be completely 
re-oriented. You have to know where not to 
go, where not to stand, the same th i

12 -- 10 - 12 prisoners there. Would take the

said, pick it up. Well, once you out of the thin
g, he took the p -- his rifle, and he sh -- 
he told us to lie down, he 
would shoot the guy. I mean, this  what the games that they

A: The what? 
Q: Orchestra. 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, who wouldn™t 
know the orchestra. 
We had a very  good 
orchestra. We had all Jewish musicians a
nd we had the Polish conductor, very good 
conductor, conducting the 
things. They used to di -- di -- di -- di -- we used to have 

concerts on Sunday when we weren™t work i
ng. We had a f -- very fine Jewish guy 
from 
Italy
, wa -- a wonderful tenor, he used to si
ng tenor arias. I mean, there was such 
a contrast in things that were happening th
ere, you know? It was just unbelieva -- this 
was in the same 
[indecipherable]
 -- where the orchestra was playing was the same 
place where the next day they wo
uld hang all the people or beat them up. It was right 
in front of the kitchen, the kitchen wa
s like in a horseshoe fashion made, it was 
build ings here, here, and here
. And there was a big, wide opening that was very good 
for a stage, for anything you 
wanted to do, you know? So 
the orchestra used to play 
there, but the orchestra also us
ed to play when we
 used to go out to
 work. If it was in 
the summer, they would play 
outside. If it was in the winter, or it was raining, they

would play inside in the wi
ndows, they would open the windows in th at room wh ere 
they were playing. So we we
nt out, we marched out, they
 were playing marches, you 
know. And we would march out, and then  we
 came back with th
e -- the dead, they 
usually had waltzes, an d things, it was a ridi
culous, really unbelievable things that 
happened there. ﬁThe 
Merry Widow,ﬂ ﬁLand of Smiles.ﬂ A

they used to 
play. Bu t it was a good orchestra, nevertheless. 
Q: Was it helpful in any way to hear 
the music, or it was just ludicrous? 
A: Well, I still enjoyed hearing music, I mean -- 
Q: Is it -- y eah. 

A: It was something I mean -- I remember I 
-- when I used to 
see the birds fly, I 
always said, why can™t I fly like that? Fly ove

tough time, horrible. No t ev

oks can really -- even my 
speech cannot really reflect all the things wh
ich happened there, and you cannot -- of 
course you cannot feel it, b
ecause it didn™t happen to you. I even today it -- don™t feel 
it any mo re to the same extent. I mean, you 
get hit with a -- with a -- with a rubber ber 
-- hose, you feel it. And those pe -- people su
ffered terrible. My friends -- is there still

Rudi Koln

barracks that I was in 
Auschwitz

be a lot of build ing, we build ro ads a

Adolf 
Hitler

Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. And I worked on this 
[indecipherable]
 we had to take the b -- bricks and -- 
it was actually -- brought it fro

really, there was no actual rhyme nor reason to
 doing it in the first place. So then I™m 
carrying, all of a sudden the Americans fly 
over there and start shooting wi -- ma chine 
gun fire. And I took the bricks, I figure the 
hell with this, and I fell da -- threw myself 
down , and I saw the -- the -- the bullets, 
you know, and I saw the 
sand -- the -- the dust

to go down the road, and th en they  come ba

back, this pilot. So
 I was saved there.  
Q: This was when you were in 
Auschwitz

Buna

A: When ausch -- in 
Auschwitz
. In 
Auschwitz
 there was a -- we w o rked, and the -- 
and we used to go -- there was a factory an
d they had big machin

they had an air raid, we used to go in -- 
into the -- where the ca

would -- there were big 
b-ba to ng
 plates, they would -- I mean, berp -- what do you 
call 
batong

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And they were put over and then after th
e air raid was over, they -- we would come 
out again. Unfortunately, 
Auschwitz
 was never bombed, except the 
SS
 barracks in 
Auschwitz
 were. I was there too when that happe
ned. I was work ing there, and we had 
to go in the basement, and a
ll of a sudden, there was such 
a n -- pressure, air pressure 
from that bomb falling, I fell over two rows 
of people. But nothi
ng happened to me, 
and nothing happened to the people there. A
nd then the women started to scream, there 
was a women™s camp in 
Auschwitz II
 that w as in

 That was 
where they -- they fixed the 
SS
 uniforms and ironed them, whatever they had to do 
there. And the guard s ran out, and got the 
SS 
man, one 
SS
 man said, ﬁThey not have to 
shoot them, they™re just scared

this was a three story building, it was called

two miles, or a mile and a half mo re 
from the main camp. 
Q: I see. 
A: When  you work ed at night -- y

SS
 would walk

 wooden towers --

 needed a lot of

very early March. So you™re there for 
almost two years, am I right? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you get stronger the lo
nger you were there, because 
you get used to this in some 
way? 
A: Yeah, I get -- I™m -- not because I got used to. You get stronger because some 
conditions slightly, slightly 
improved in the ca
mp. They need
ed already people. The -- 
the Russians were closing in on, there were 
no mo re slave labors to be gotten from the 
eastern ber -- ber -- countries. So what they  
did is since they needed work er, we got a 
little bit more ri -- we d idn™t get more brea
d or anything, but we
 got a little bit more 
soup. What happened 
was when  a -- when 
people came in the 
[indecipherable]
 they 
had breads, and all kinds of -- some of them
 was hide diamonds, and th en all this. The 
bread was taken to th e kitchen, and they
 made a bread soup 
out of it. But the 
unfortunate thing was some wa -- some of th
e bread was mo ldy, I used to get a terrible 
heartburn from that bread soup. Bu t it helped, you know?

to a dog. And it helped you somehow bolsteryour body a little bit, to a slight extent. 
And I actually felt a little better -- I mean, 
I wouldn™t say I felt as good as wh en I got 
in for the first time, but I felt better 
than at the beginning of it, you know? 
Q: Right. 
A: And we had a little bit more rest, too. I 
think we worked on 
Saturdays, only till 
about four o™clock, and we used to work 
till seven. And Sundays y
ou were also -- what 
we did, we used to get soup, we would eat,
 and then we would go
 to -- I would go to 
sleep. 
Q: For th e day. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Unless say -- some extra-curricular activ
ity was going on, they had a -- that the 
SS
 
was counting, or something. But mo st of 
the time that didn™t happen. So  I had mu ch 
more rest, too. So I actually 
felt a little better. I couldn™t 
have made that Death March 
without having had a little improve 
-- improvement within my body. 
Q: Were you also -- did you have im-impr
oved clothes, did you 
get better shoes? Or 
were you still wearing the wooden shoes? 

A: No, I wasn™t wearing the wooden shoe
s any mo re. The wooden shoes was also a 
thing that al -- that also de
pended upon luck. Sometimes 
they would have some shoes 
from people that they wouldn
™t use. Some -- I wa -- I had once one brown shoe, and

one black shoe also. I mean, wa -- 
there were no fashion parades in  
Auschwitz.  
Needless to say,
 
who cares? But they were shoes ne
vertheless, and they was mu ch 
better than these wooden things, because they
 got -- they gave -- they  broke your feet 
up, and th ey gave -- they -- they started bleed
ing, and oh, horrible. 
They never fit right, 
I mean, you couldn™t make them fit the 
-- and then th e other thing was we had no 
shoelaces. Once shoelace broke, 
or you couldn™
t knot them together
 any more, you had 
to rely on your own ingenuity, if you we
re lucky, to find a piece of string, or 
something you could hold it with, if not y
ou had to go like this
. You had to go like 
somebody goes to the bathroom at night, 
actually. And I had -- yeah , I had shoes 
already then. I think I had a little bit better uni
form, too. I used to

Q: Yeah, right. 
A: And I might have not heard it, or I don™t know why I didn™t hear it. 

Q: Did you think you changed in  
Auschwitz
 as a person? 
A: No, I don™t think -- I did change, but th
e only thing my outlo
ok on certain things 
have changed. I wouldn™t think that I change
d, I mean, I bi -- didn™t become cruel or 
bitter, or anything like that. I still enjoy 
company of people, you know, and -- but I 
became anti-religious. Anti-religion. Because I 
figure -- I said to myself, if there™s a 
God, and He wasn™t there, we ne -- who ne
eds Him? This was the worst thing that can 
happen to  a person. To lose his life, ch
ildren, women. People who never did anything 
wrong. So I don™t need Him. If I have to go
, I go, so -- and th en the story wh ich is you 
go to heaven, for heaven™s sake. It must be 
a crowded place, that they going to heaven 
now since the -- since the 
Adam
 and 
Eve
, and before, even.  
Q: But you weren™t very religious before, wh
en you grew up, and y-you grew up in a 
house that was traditional until your father died. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But did you believe
 in God then, even 
though you wer --  
A: Yeah, I guess so, I was 
totally believe in God -- 
Q: So you were?

A: But I believed what they told me. 
Q: Right. 

A: I mean my father re -- was a v ery intellig
ent man, and I -- we believed what he told 
us, you know? 
Q: Right. So do you thi
nk you became an atheist? 
A: Yeah, in a way, I think so. 
Q: Do you -- do you think yo
u became cynical about huma
n beings because of what 
you saw? 

A: In which w -- w -- ga -- ga
 -- define that a little more. 
Q: Well – If the behavior of people surprise
d you, that people could be so cruel and 
so indifferent to other human 
beings, did you then begin to  
believe that it was -- that it 
was less likely that people could be
 good under certain circumstances? 

A: No. 

Q: In other word s, it was very easy to make people behave in terrible ways. 
A: No, I don™t think it™s easy to make -- I believe that there are people that are born to  
be ruthless, and when you really think a
bout it, the Germans were -- had the upper 
hand in 
Euro pe
, because nobody could beat the Ge
rmans, the French, the English, 
everybody was afraid of the Ge
rmans. So if you have so mu
ch power, it™s easy to be a 
hero, you know? The 
Germans went into 
Poland
, they marched behind the tanks, you 
know, th-the -- the Poles came on horses, y
ou know? But when  -- 
when -- when they

came to 
Stalingrad
, th ey were running faster than a rabbit. So all of a sudden the 
supermen were not so super d
uper any mo re as they prete
nded to be. Because I believe 
normally that every person, in case of dange
r, is going to go and -- is going to  lose his 
heroic ideas and do wh at the rest does, you
 know? So the German
s were actually -- I 
mean, really in my opinion 
they were not superior to 
anybody because they were 
superior as far as the material go -- went
, the -- the -- the war material, but once the 
allies got to the point where they overt
ook them, there w ere no more heroes.  
Q: Right. 
A: And I still insist today that
 actually the real winner of
 war were the Russians. The 
Russians had more casualties, an d fought more
 than anybody else. The Russians had to 
fight because 
Stalin
 would send them in, they coul
dn™t come out. If somebody was not 
brave, they  would put them up ag ainst the 
wall. And th ey did a wonderful job, they 
really did. And -- and that™s why th at time when 
Stalin 
me t  
Churchill
, he says to him, 
ﬁYou know,ﬂ he said, ﬁyou cannot win this
 war.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou always tell you™re 
going to  attack when  you don™t do anything.ﬂ
 He says, ﬁIf you want to win a war, you 
have to go into comb at with
 the enemy, otherwise you ca
n™t win the war.ﬂ And he was 
right. And 
Churchill 
was sitting there with his cigar, 
and was listening, you know. But 
eventually -- the British are lik
e that. The British like everyt
hing should be settled in a 
diplomatic way. You can™t se
ttle with the -- with people 
like Nazis in a diplomatic 
way, with  German 
Hitlerites

Q: Did you know th ere was going to be a marc
h out of -- they were going to evacuate 
you from 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Yeah, absolutely, you kn
ew. Because we knew that 
they -- the Russians were 
coming, you could hear the 
artillery and everything. And 
when the Germans put us -- 
th -- told us we have to leave the camp, we 
knew that we had to -- we were going on a 
march. I mean, the -- the Germans didn™t use 
[indecipherable]
 and say this to -- to s -- 
to chauffeur us, we had to walk on th
e -- it was terrible too, it was snowing and 
snowing and snowing. I don™t know how 
lo ng I walked, if you would ask me how 
many days I was on the road, I really wouldn™t know. And I 
[indecipherable]
 was 
sleeping and walking at the same time. 

Q: The same time? 
A: When I woke up, I thought 
I was in the same spot that 
I originally was when I fell 
asleep. It lo oked all the same. Snow, snow, 
snow. Dead people on the road, prisoners. 
People shot, and blood running in th e sn
ow. You didn™t see a
nything you -- it looked 
like that whole area was what™s like a monoton
ous area, like you walk into a desert, 
there was no end and no beginning. And we
 were -- we overtook the women when we 
walked, and of course there was that -- alwa
ys the truck there to pick up the dead 
people we had to throw on there. We didn™t
 walk during the day
time, they -- they -- 
they didn™t want the Poles, and the people -- the civilians to see us, I guess. So in the 
daytime they would put us in some kind of
 empty haylofts, and 
empty places where

they had cows, and things like that, and 
we had -- we slept there on the dirt. I 
reme mb er waking up one mo rn ing,
 I have ants in my  mouth.
 It was -- my -- it was like 
a -- well, you know wh en you take a st
rawberry from animals that was laying 
[indecipherable]
 defecating, and so -- th -- that™s
 where they -- th
ey put us, you 
know? But we had to  march on, and march on 
and finally we came to a train. And this 

train took us to 
Gross Rosen
, I think. 
Gross Rosen
 is in lower 
Silesia
, but it was a 
horrible camp too. 
Gross Rosen 
was -- had a lot of 
ka po s
 and criminals, supervisors, 
you know. In some instance yo
u had couples were political pr
isoners, they were not as 
bad. You know, Co mmunists, or -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- some people that they di -- had a 
brain, they knew that -- what was going on 
there. But these guys, they -- 
they still -- they also believe
d that the -- that the Germans 
would win the war. In fact, the Germans re
cruited from some of these prisons, they 
recruited them for war duty at the end, some
 of the -- I remember they were exercising 
with wooden sticks, and they had to sing, 
and -- and carry the wooden stick over their 
shoulder like a rifle, you kn
ow they wouldn™t give them a rifle. You know what 
happened when you give
 a criminal a rifle, but they 
must have used them well for 
military purposes later on.

Q: How long were y

A: Oh, a couple of days only -- 
Q: That™s all? 

A: -- I don™t know, maybe a week. Was horrible, 
[indecipherable]
 the -- every day 
two prisoners -- four -- four pr
isoners had to go to get the 
-- the breakfast tea. That was 
some water, and some kind of a plant they
 put in there, was brown, it was horrible 
tasting. It was icy there, and 
it was all up on the hill, and we used to slide around there, 
we were afraid we -- if you spilled that 
tea, it was the end of you, you know? And 
when I s -- was ther
e a week, and the 
[indecipherable] 
I have a transfer to go, I said, 
ﬁI™m volunteering. I™m going.ﬂ I didn™t like it th
ere at all. So I went on again, they 
marched us. And then finally we went into
 a train. Again a freight train, again 
overcrowd ing, ag ain no food, an d we had an  aw
ful lot of people dying in that train. It 
was really so bad we couldn™t leave on th
e ground. I mean, they
 were laying on the 
ground 
[indecipherable]
 couldn™t sit -- couldn™t stand 
-- if you did this -- we had a 
brilliant idea, we took one of the blankets
 and we knotted it onto the -- the two metal 
bars there where the sliding door was, a
nd we made a hammo ck out of them, we put 
the corpses in that. And, course not a nice 
thing to  see when there™s -- every time you

see dead heads shaking back
 and fo rth. Bu t it was better than having them on the 
ground, we -- that the living had to sit, or 
things -- had to -- look 
-- so finally when we 
got to 
[indecipherable]
 it was either regen -- no, it could have been  
Regensburg  
or 
Augsburg
. I would say it was 
Regensburg. Regensburg, 
all of a sudden the door 
opened, and the 
SS
 said, ﬁIf you throw out the dead, you going to  get something to 
eat.ﬂ Oh, oh, wonderful. So 
I grabbed them by th e head, 
and this other guy grabbed 
them by the leg, and we just slid them 
out, you know, one after the other. We had 
about 15 of th
em in there. 
Q: 15 in that hammock-like -- 
A: Y -- not only the hammo ck, we -- we put th
em in the corners, we put them any -- 
any odd way where we can put
 them where they would 
take up the least space. 
Q: I see. 

A: And some people tried to break their bone
s, and figured that they could make them 
smaller that way. And well, 
we got them out, and I still s
ee them, th ey were rolling 
down  from the railroad tracks there. And th
en the -- the German Red Cross came and 

they gave us a little cu p of soup th
ere, you know, like it was this big. 
Q: That was -- that was the soup? 
A: Yeah, it was soup. That was the food we go
t. And we got a piece of bread, and th en 
they closed that up again. And since we had 
already the soup, they  didn™t think th at we 
would need water. So off we went and th
is was already -- the Germans were t --

coming back from the front, and th trains were
 going to other fronts, and -- and th-the 
railroads were bumper to bumper there. We had to wait till the -- the army per -- trains 
were going. In the meantime we had the air 
attack by the American
s, and we™re lucky 
they didn™t hit our train, and things like -- 
it w as horrible. It was -- y ou™re sitting inside 
a railroad car -- or standing inside the railr
oad car. You cannot move, you can™t get out 
of it, because it™s locked. And here were thes
e bombs falling. It™s a hell of a situation, 
you know? I mean, at least if you are in th
e war, you can throw yourself down, or hide 
behind a bush, or wh atever you can do, I don™t know. 
[indecipherable]

matter of luck. I don™t thin
k that anybody got out of 
Auschwitz

that fled, on account of their ow

 bad as it was, and as much I suffered, I 
was still lucky. I was lucky to escape all thes

I know where I finally had arrived wh
ere I was supposed to go. And it was 
Muhldorf
, 
it was the forest camp, or the 
Wald lager

Waldlager
 also 
had no gas chambers. Th

they™re in the open, so the

because they™re underground. So
 we had three shifts going

work  project -- 
Q: Of digging underg round to create -- 
A: No, here™s what it was. You came to a 
spot there, and there were wheelbarrows, 
wheelbarrows galore, and prisoners galore as 
well. So there were b -- planks going up 
like a little hill, and when you 
came to that hill there was 
a big shaft and there were p-
pillars there. Cement pillars
, whatever. And you had to em
pty -- they filled the thing 
up with cement before you we

the cement in there, and then
 you go back again around a

And there were some people that fell in, 
they were so weak, 
they fell into these 
column s, you know, the next 
guy, what could do, he -- he put the cement on top of 
him. I bet -- I bet you that there™s still b-bones in these things there,

take your own people in there, all the Hung

he took me in. And this

 loved to -- to do this because he always liked to hit 
people. So that was another job for him to do,
 and I went in there, and I was together

was imagining that I had killed the camp 
commander and had him

wouldn™t take me. The next mo rning th ey t

A: I got out and I -- they brought me to a place that was called 
Ecksberg, E-c-k-s-b-e-

, and th ey made a hospital out of it, I had 
good care. At first 
I didn™t get mu ch to 
eat, because they knew that if
 they would feed me that I 
would die, you 
know, because 
I didn™t -- hadn™t eaten for over two years,
 you know? And ev entu ally -- oh, they  took 
care -- I had a pus in my -- on my finger. In f
act I still -- I still can see here the scar 
where he cut it. And finally we gots 
already cigarettes, ﬁLucky Strikesﬂ -- 
Q: Oh yes? 

A: -- he brought us, and then he brought us 
Hershey™s 
tropical chocolate, that was an 
issue in those days for the 
army  because the chocolate didn™t melt as fast, or didn™t 
melt, whatever. 
Q: Tropical chocolate? 
A: Yeah, was called 
Hershey™s 
tropical chocolate for the army , and it didn™t melt. We 
were in good shape already. And then I 
-- there was a very pretty woman, she was 
married to an 
SS
 man, and one American took a 
fancy, then she became the 
supervisor, and I had already fights with 
-- and I wasn™t normal at that time, I had 
typhus. There was a tin y little plant outside, a

haven™t eaten salad in three years, and I 
wanted a salad. Well, little thing like this.

nothing there.ﬂ I said, ﬁI want it. If you don™t
 give it to me, I™m going to go to the -- to 
the Americans and tell them to give it to me
.ﬂ And I didn™t get it anyway , needless to 
say. And a lot of peoples were still dying in
 th at hospital. You woke up in th e mo rning, 
there was another one dead, and he had to
 be carried out and all this. And we -- 
Q: So is -- is one of the symptoms of this kind of 
spotted
 typhus 
A: -- From the typhus, I guess, yeah. 
Q: -- is delirium, with -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I don™t know how I got out of, but I 
did -- I did -- I did get out of it, and then 
when I was already a little bit improving, bu
t still in the state like a s-skeleton, the 
ﬁ
Stars and Stripes
ﬂ used to come, used to take pictures, and I -- I was always 
horrified when they came because they -- I had to sit down, and I was na -- only bones, 
and when  I sat down it felt as if somebody 
put a needle up my  back , you know? But 
you had to go th rough with, you
 know, so I did. And -- 
Q: Why did they take pictures? 

A: I guess for the newspaper, I guess they maybe
 they freed us, th-th --th -- these army 
guys probably freed it, or a part of -- I don™t 
know. They took -- a lo
t of pictures were 
taken of these camps. That™s why you ha

pictures were t -- were taken. In the meantime, the
 SS
 wasn™t there any more. When -- 
when we -- when the t -- when
 the Americans came close, 
I was -- I remember it was a 
day I was lying outside yet in the camp, and 
resting, the sun was shin ing, was beautiful 
day. All of a sudden, the Americans came 
and -- and bomb s fell in the forest. I saw 
[indecipherable]
. But only once or twice. Th
en, all of a sudden the 
SS
 disappeared,
 
and called the local police in to guard us. 
So when the American
s came, a lot of the 
SS
 
had disappeared already. The pol
ice, they didn™t know -- th
ey said they 
didn™t know, 
and they  were called in, they had to go, 
you know? So I don™t 
know how many they 
caught there, there were -- I was in that -- expected -- that recuperation area there, I 
would say for at least two months, until I 
got a little better, you kn
ow, and then they 
discharged  me, and I went on th e -- there we
re no trains going thos
e day, there were 
freight trains. If you hopped on a frei
ght train you took a chance, it could go 
anywheres. And that™s what it was. I remember
 being on a train, a 
day and a half I fell 
asleep, I was in 
Augsberg 
twice. The train was going to  
Aug sberg
, came back and 
went back  to 
Aug sberg
, and I was still on. So -- 
but eventually I got to 
Furth
. It was a 
scary thing because all these railro ad crossi

Furth

Nuremberg

Nuremberg

A: I went to 
Nuremberg
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I come to 
Nuremberg, 
again I had a problem there, 
that you co uldn™t get a room. 
So they let me sleep in one 
of the bunkers that they built what -- where the people used 
to go in for the air raids, 
and was no electricity. I couldn™t find the electric switch. I 
was in there, it was dark, I fe
ll asleep. In the morn
ing when I got up I couldn™t find the 
door. I was in that thing longer than I ever wa
nted to be. Finally I 
got out, and I finally 
I contacted the Jewish congregation there. 
The head of the Jewish congreg ation was 
married to a non-Jewish woman, so he was 
not in the camp, and he
 took over business 
there for us, you know? And he got me a room
, and I got a job with him, I was helping 
him out, I used to go on a bicycle, and br
ing envelopes to people, you know, to the 
Americans, and all kinds of things. And fi
nally -- oh, th ey had it good already because 
all the -- th e -- the p
ackages came from the 
United States
 with food and things, they 
came to that place, you know? So I had -- 
I now had marmalade to
 eat, and I hadn™t

seen marmalade, I didn™t even
 know what it look

didn™t even think 
of it, I didn™t even know it existed. And I had 
it, then I got a job as an assistant to a mo

a year with the -- till I -- till I came over here

A: Had a relative.

A: He came after the first World War to 
Atla nta, Georgia
, and he opened up a flower 
shop. And he was very  successful, he had 
whole plan tations there and all kinds of

Q: Right. But now, at a certain point, bef -- 
I think it™s a -- a few weeks before you go 
to 
Bremen
 to get the boat, you are going to
 interviewed by somebody named 
David 
Boder? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: How did it -- how did it happen? 
A: I was at the place in 
Munich
, was called the
 Funkenkaserne
, it was once an army 
p-post there, the electronic equipment, or 
whatever that was called in those days. And 
it was empty and they  used that as a staging area for the people wh ere they had rooms. 
It was a halfway decent place, I mean th
ere was -- it was not 
dirty or anything. 
Q: Right. 

A: And of course it was -- we had not -- not
 much to do there because you si -- sit 
around talk, and thing. You get tired of it. 
So one day I see a lady 
there, and she says 
to me, you know, I was ju

Boder

Boder
 was. Der -- she says, ﬁWhy don™t y

he said, ﬁOh yeah , yeah , I can use you, s

Q: Right. Was this one small room that he was in? 
A: Yeah, it was like a -- yeah, like a little room. 

Q: Uh-huh. And do you remember -- 
A: And there was a table, I remember, and 
a tape recorder -- there wasn™t a tape 
recorder, a wire recorder. 
Q: Wire recorder. Was this a big mach ine? Do you remember what it was? 

A: Oh, about the size of a typewriter 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: A big typewriter? 

A: Yeah, a big typewriter. I remember -- I th i

 I™m not sure, but I think it was.

how do you play?

as clear as this. 
Q: As this? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What was that like for you,
 to be interviewed by him? 
Is this the first time anyone 
had asked you what
 had happened? 
A: Yeah. Well, no, some Germans were intere
st to hear what really happened there, 
and so on, they listened to me
, say they never -- they never really said we did a wrong 
thing, or they never apologized. It was just 
-- they were interested
 in hearing it, like, 
you know? And he was -- he 
wa -- I don™t think -- he was a good in terviewer, but he 
was like a -- like a general talking to a serg
eant, you know? Or a general talking to a 
private or a corporal, you know? He was -- 
he was not a per -- a person with  a -- he 
had no personality at all. He was li
ke what they call in German a 
pedagoga, 
a 
pedagogue. He was strictly like a teacher, 
where were you born, 
how long did you live 
there, what came next, what did you do 
there, what did you do? It was like an 
interrogation more than an interview. 
Q: And not an interview. 
So were you uncomfortable 
with him, do you rememb er?

I mean, I -- I would -- I had never kind of 
a close contact feeling with him, what you 
have -- like I have with you, you know, b
ecause -- not because he was a man, that 
might be one of the reasons, but he -- he 
was like a -- I don™t kno
w, very p -- without 
feelings, like, you know? Without emotions. 
He was a man like that, probably that™s 
how he was. Because not too much is known 
about his private life.
 E v en the guy that 
writes the book tells me that. 
Q: Did he explain to
 you why he was doing 
th is, or did he just sit down and started 
interviewing you? 
A: No, no, no, no -- 

Q: He didn™t -- no explanation. 
A: -- he didn™t explain anything. Bu t there was no 
Shoah 
foundation then I don™t 
think, and -- 
Q: No, nobody was doing intervie

 one of the first --

I™m going to play you part of th

Boder
 is 
asking you whether people got 
their businesses back in 
Munich
, I think it is. And you 
answer, and he™s talking about the Jewish
 community coming back, and the synagogue 
opening, as you tell him. And then  he starts 
to say to you something about that you™re 
becoming American, and you say not quite. An
d then  he gives you some advice. So I 
thought we would just listen to 
that, because it™s sort of inte
resting at the end that he tr 
-- is trying to be very  supportive 
of you. So let™s listen here.

it now? I mean, th

soon be across and let me give you some 
good advice. Don™t let anybody tell you th at education is expensive in 
America
. There 
are expensiv e schools, and av erage priced
 schools, and th ere are free schools, and 
there are courses by correspondence. Young pe
ople study, older pe
ople study, and you 
will find a way. It might be 
good for you upon arrival in 
America, 
after having taken a 
rest, after having looked around a bit, that you go to a place wher
e they give vocational 
advice.ﬂ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And you say yes. And th en he goes on. 
I mean, he™s clearly being the pedagogue -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- but in some way caring about you. 
A: Y -- Human, being mo re human. 
Q: And then  he says, ﬁpsychological 
and occupational advice. They may find 
something for you to  do that you may learn 
without difficulty. Th
ere are such places, 
and the 
ORT 
is also active in 
America
, and your relatives will 
probably assist you, 
and if you work hard, and get 
accustomed to the life 
there, things will be all rig h t. And

America 
before I shall return,

and I will give you my address. Drop me

managed to arrange things.ﬂ A
nd th en you say, ﬁI wish to 
thank you, first of all, for 
giving me the opportunity to 
talk about my expe
riences in the lager, so that people 
should get a picture of what -- of that whic
h has really happened. 
Wh at I have told you 
are only isolated incidents, and I can tell 
it with a clean conscience, but nothing is 
exaggerated. On  the contrary, one cannot 
describe these things the way it really 
happened .ﬂ 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: That seemed as if at that mome
nt he changed with
 you a little bit. 
A: Mm. 

Q: D-Do you -- do you re-remember that
 part of the interview at all?  
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: I remember -- I remember him asking -- 
t-telling me that he would give me his 
address. He seemed to be a little w armer -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- at this point -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- to me, e-even at the a -- b-before you 
told me about it. But -- but do we -- I have

194
ge -- general terms, it woul
d probably somehow -- that word
 from the main point that 
he wanted  to bring out. In other wo rds, th
ere would be talk about priv ate things, or 
things like that. And he wanted the facts, 
so to speak, you know, 
what really happened 
there. 
Q: Right. 
A: And he probably  figured  if he tells me 
lik e in a -- in a manner like a -- a -- a general 
to a private, that it would impress me mo re, and th en I would -- 
Q: You would tell him -- 
A: -- give the answers faster and better, you know? 

Q: Yeah. Right. Cause he certainly pushes you -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- in the interview, what happen
ed here, and what happened th ere. 
A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: So this -- 
A: Sometimes it seems to me that he wanted
 to make sure. I mean he -- he sometimes 
touched on one subject a few 
times, probably to make sure
, maybe I would ch ange my  
mind and say something else, or so -- which 
also could be the -- be the case in his -- 
that he thought it -- thought that. 
Q: Y-You said the interview, i-it didn™t occu

 did part one, and then  you

A: I came in December. It was a v ery
 bad crossing, it was stormy. The 
Queen 
Elizabeth 
was two days late, and the thing was going like so and so and so. I was 
seasick. Now, here I was after not having 
eaten good th ings in so many years, and 
there were oranges, and apples
, and I couldn™t eat anything. 
Q: Because you were so sick? 

A: Yeah. I could really, truly say that I made
 the crossing by rail, because I was always 
throwing up. 

Q: So when di -- when -- that
™s really funny -- when  did you first contact your sister so 
she knew that you were alive? 
A: I don™t know -- I contact my -- c

up like she did, but I 
wasn™t too keen on her.ﬂ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: I knew she wasn™t too keen on her.  

Q: Right. 
A: She never was. And I don™t think that my
 mother -- my mother 
of -- my mother was 
not a doting mo ther to begin with
, but she preferred me to her.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I think th e reason fo r that was maybe be
cause she was grown up already, and now 
if she would meet a man, they would know
 how old she is, may -- maybe that was one 
of the reasons, psychologically. And sh e always
 liked to dress my
