like before the Germ ans invaded? 
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :W e had no problem at all.  I was the youngest of nine children, and I went to 

public school. I went to Hebrew school.  Idid play a lotof  games with other children. W e got along 
f ine.  Now and then we had a skirm ish, but who doesn't? W hen youplay soccer, you always argue.  
T wo m inutes later, you m ake up.  You're still buddies. Our neighbors, we got along with our 
neighbors. W edidn't have any problem . They used to come to theshop, and they were on a 
f i rs t

nam e basis with my f ather.  He was still alive at thattim e. W e couldn't see any problem  
whatsoever.  Of  course, all that changed.  My f ather passedaway t wo m onths before thewar, and 

then m y mom , being protective of  kids, not the m arried sisters, they had husbandstoprotect them , 
with the kids,butthe others were hom e with us, and she decided togo, to takeus with a neighbor on 
our horse and buggy t o to farm.  
 
>>W arren Marcus: Tell us how m any siblings with you, boys, girls .  Describe thefam ily.  
 

>> Henry Greenbaum : On thatfarm, we came with our three sisters  and m yself ,and the oldest of 
the brothers.  T
he other brother served in thePolish arm y.  I didn't know where he was.  He was 
f ighting in the war. T hey were nom atchf orthe Germ ans,of  course. T hey were understaffed of after 

the war, we f ound outhe was a prisoner inaghetto in Lithuania, and I didn't m eethim  till af ter the

W hile we were on thefarm  with the oldest of the brothers, we were out there on thefarm ,

also, hisunif orm  was a little ripped.  He had a lot of decoration, a lot of medals o
n h i m.  Som e ho w,  
m y brother knew of  his name. Maybe he was one of our custom ers. Maybe he served in the 
outskirts of the town, maybe like whatever soldier he was, butthen he knew hisf irst nam e.  
 
 
He says to him ,W here are you runningf rom?  
 
 
He said,
 
I'm  runningf rom theGermanarm y. They're com ing this way.  T hey have three 
kilom eters to come here.  Hedidn't want to get caughtby the German arm y to become aprisoner.  

He saidhe was running awa y.  
 
 
All of  a sudden, I could notbelieve m y ears what
 
I heardm y brothersaid, Is it OK if I go with 
you?  He said, Yeah, be m y guest.  
 
>>W arren Marcus: How old is your brotherat thispoint?  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum:  Late 20s, I guess.  My herobrother,m y protector.  My f atherpassed away, I 

was expecting 
him  to protect m e.  
 
 
Anyway, he tookoff  with that soldier, and I didn't like that. Ihidebehind bushes.  Following a 
couple m ilesalmost. Ever y tim e I stick m y headout, Go back to your m other.  Gobacktoyour

tom y m other, I said OK.  I wound up going back tom y m om ,and I told her the news, what happened.  
T hey disappeared, they run awa y.  He was the bread winner in thefam ily afterm y f atherdie

Our little house was not toof arf rom the railroad station. W e cleaned up.  I wasf rightenedof  the Nazi

all of  a sudden they decided they needed people to go to work.  Sowho did they grab in
 
the street?  
T he one that looked Jewish.  I hadthe little curls here.  I had the tassels sticking out. T heywere bare 

headed.  Anybody that walks on the sidewalk that way they were grabbing to go to work, because 
they knew they were Jewish.  Lateron,theychanged it. T hey tookus, put us on the yellow Star of 
David.  Ever y one of us had to wear this yellow Star of David.  
 
 
W elived near the synagogue, aboutf ive doors away m aybe.  Quiteaf ew other Jewish people

Otherfam iliesdid too.  But we managed. W e stayed in that areaf oralm ost two years, we s tayed in

W eheard newsf rom out of town what didthe Nazis like and dislike. They liked if  you worked 
in afactory.  They liked if  you workedf or thegovernm ent. TheShoem aker, tailors, it didn't make any 
difference. They like when you work in thefactory or stone quarry or producing springs orbrakes, 
aircraf t shells. They like that.  
 
 
My f ather was still alive.  Oneof  our customers cam e into our shop,andm y father approached 
him .  He knew that he is running afactory notfar away f rom us.  Hesays,W ould you give m y children 
a job in yourf actory?  It was a Polishm an.  He says, Yes, sure. He tookm e, not quite12,andm y 
three sisters. W eall worked inthef actory.  W ehad IDs. T he only wa y you can come outof  the

was the only one in the barrack by herself. W hy?  It's beyondm e. It's m ind

boggling wh y they didn't 
takeher where they took all the other sickpeopleaway and shotthem and they just killedthem .  
 
 
She was suffering a slow death.  She was inthat little barrack by herself , ona shelf .  You 
would think it's supposed to be a sickperson, put some straw so she can rest or something.  She 

com plained to me, Ihave bedsoresf rom thewooden shelf .  Can you get me some cloth? Cloth, 
cloth, If igured out in the munitionf actory they m ight have cloth there, especially f rom the cloth that I 
wipe the equipm ent off.  I tried to take the
 
clean clothes.  It took methree trips to sm uggle them in, lay 
them  on her bunk. She thankedm efor it. It's a littlebit betternow, she says, and it's sof ter.  
 

 
Oneday I walked in after that, she was notthere.  I said,W here would she go? She coul
dn ' t  
walk.  I approached the Jewish policem an, which we had in our slave labor camp,I askedhim  what 

happened to Yita? She was there yesterday m orning. W hathappenedtoher? She saidshe died 
during thenight. W eburied her in the bottom of  the stone quarry.  W here? W hat? I don't know.  
T hat's theanswer I got fromthe Jewish policem an.  So I lost one sister.  I came backf rom  the night 
shift, oneof  theother days, there I see Faige,them iddle sister, in apickup truck. T he

T he Einsatzgruppenput them in the little pickup truckand take them to theoutskirts of the

Mind you, when I was telling you they put us on the yellow Star of David, they grabbed us in the 
ghettoor the street, wherever, we had todig trenchesf or them . They toldus the trenches weref or

T he war was still going on.  T hey knew what they wer e going to do, they were going 
to kill peopleand need somewhere tobury them . T hey can't leave the dead people on theoutside, 

badpublicity for them, and not cleanf or the rest of the population, so they had to bury them . That's

Anyway, I could notf ind her. I said she would not,m aybe she ran awa y.  She thought maybe I 
died when thebullet hit m ef rom the impact, itknocks you out. 
 
 
So Idecided instead of lookingf or her outside through that hole, which I made a good 
decision, because had they caughtm e close to that they would have probably this tim e I wouldn'tbe 

so lucky, thebullet grazing m e, I would probably have caught abullet in my heador whatever.  I

getting into them ud.  They hada rail leading into there, but thatarea didn't have anything.  He

I said,I know I'm  thefuture, but youhave totell what happened so we can avoid it happening 
again, by us
 
telling thestory what they didtous.  
 
 
I took till 1978. I thought, that was m y idea, they hada picture playi ng, it was called 
" Holocaust."   
 
>>W arren Marcus: TV show, right.  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum : Threenights on NBC. No Hollywood in there.  It was a lot of true things in 

there,99% I would say, but really happened.Right after that,people were interested in thesurvi vors.  
 
 
T hen we didn't have enough tim eto talk. W e were invited ever ywhere.  Now I'm not trying to 
show you off, but I was invited to Larry King r adio in Crystal
 
Cit y ri ght after thatfilm  was playing.  I 
was there on radio with apriest by the nam eof  Eugene Fisher.

T he second question, is your name, which isyour correct nam e? There's two nam es here on the 
paper.  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum : The correct name is G
-r-e -
e.  Greenbaum . The reasonI changed
 
tha t is 
becausem y father's two brothers andtheir children spelled their name G
-r-e -
e, why shouldn't I do 
that? T hen I said Chuna, in Europe, here inAm erica, Chuna, C
-h -u-n -

>>W arren Marcus:W hat's wrong with that,Henry?  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum : My sister said peoplewi ll laugh.  You needto change it.  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum : I said I am  going to change to G
-r-e -

public school, they calledm e Henyik, with an H.  Henry was close.  
 
>>W arren Marcus: So I understand, the sister already here, are you saying did shehaveany idea 
what was happening during the war, to the rest of  thefam ily?  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum:  It wasn't thatbad, really they didn't bother us until the war started. T hen it 
was too late to send messages to her. It wasn't like we have now, those little things you have, you 
carry, in two seconds they know the news.  Yeah, in two seconds. It was days or weeks.  
 
>>W arren Marcus: No tweets in1938.  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum : That's right.

>>W arren Marcus: I suggest that was a long question what sources shehad of  inf ormation. T he US 
didn't get intothe war until 1941, soonce you go into the mainexhibit you will see headlines that the 
Am erican public knew all about things upto the start of the war, in Germ any.  Then once the war 
starts there's a lot going on, adelay in term sof  when them ass killing inf orm ation comes out. So 
investigate thebroader context, then you will f ind out. OK? 
 
 
One?  Yes,m a'am , right here.  You will be next.  
 
>> T hroughout the span of the 10 years, you lost a lot off am ily m embers, and I was wondering, I'm  
s o rr
y about all of your losses, I was wondering if  when you lost yoursister Faige if you hadthe tim e 
andenergy to mournher loss in the camps, what that was like?  
 
>>W arren Marcus: She feels badaboutall of  your losses,and wonders when you lost Faige in the 

escape attem ptdid you have tim e tom ourn or was there too much going on? 
 
>> Henry Greenbaum:  I was m ourning every day.  Every day I m issed her.  Shebecame like am om  

tom e. Im issedher stretch. I saw her stretched out,that was like alm ostth
e end, the end of  m e.  I 
said I was almost ready to gi ve up, but then Isaid, no, I still have m y sister in Am erica.  She's saf e.  
Someday, with God'shelp,I'll m ake it to America.  
 
>>W arren Marcus: By the way, have you mentioned yourbrother in silver
 
spring?  How o ld he is?  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :W ell, he's 103.  But that was theone that ran away, that was a story. T hat 
was a m assive story.  When we came andI teamedup with the brother in the Polish arm y, through a 
cousin we met.  He was liberated in Poland, Iwas liberated inGermany.  Near Frankfurt. T hat same 
cousin that helpedmewith the bleeding, oneday I m et her there, inBergen
-
B e lse n,  she  says I 'm  
going to Poland to look for m y brother. I said, Ita, she wantedm etogo with her, I saidI

didn't want to go nowhere.  That was the British zone, Bergen

Belsen.  I wentto theAmerican side.  I 
said Ita, if  you go to Poland, you locate your brother, lookfor m y brother.  Maybe theone inthe Polish 
arm y is there too.  It was in Poland, they hada displacedperson there, organized by the United 
States, where there was enoughf ood, it had to be the United Statesorganized.  
 
 
She was there, shef lew over there andm et her brother.  Hehad brother knew ofm y brother, 
that he's also in
 
that Displaced Persons Camp, because they're f irst cousins.  She told him I'malive, 
near Frankfurt. It took him 3, 4 weeks to visit m e, he stayed with m e.  He was 10 years older than I 
was, that particular one.  I said where do we have our sister?  She's in Am erica, I didnot know where.  
T he soldiers tried to help, but Ididn't know wh ere.  He said thebest I can come up with, in the 
W ashington area. They started looking, thepeople in thatdisplacedperson camp. It so happened 
that they cam e up with 
shem arriedaf irst cousin, the uncle thattook her down sponsoredher.  She 
m oved into their house.  Theyf ell in love with the cousin.  She was born in Europe, he was born in 

W ashington. In New
 
York, I guess.T hen she fell in love. W hat we're trying to tell is they maintained 
the same name, except spelling diff erent.  Soit wasn't toohardtof ind her. G
