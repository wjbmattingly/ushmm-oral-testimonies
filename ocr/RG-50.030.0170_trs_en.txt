And I e ntere d s chool , t he  sc hool

was i n for more t han. Uh and as
 I say, I thi nk that t he fi rs
t clouds that I  can r ecollect 
obviously be gan whe n in Oct obe

came into our classroom and 
said all  those  chil dre n whose  par ent s had i m mi
grat ed i nto Ha mbur g __
____ uh pleas e l e ave

 or  what ever  she 
said. She  c ertai nl y 
didn't  sa y t ha t the y were going t o be de porte d 
t hat  very sa me  da y but  thi s wa s the begi nni ng 
of t he de port ation of uh Polish J ews i n  parti cul
ar. I, per ha ps it was othe r J e ws as  well , I ' m 
not  sur e. But  I t hink it  wa s Poli sh Je ws pri maril y 
wer e s ent  tha t  ver y da y, that sa me  eve n ing, 

out of Germany and back
 to the Polish border. 
I  think that  t he Pol es didn't wa nt t he m, a nd 
the Ger mans  di dn't wa nt t he m. 
I do re me mber  that  
ther e was a child of 
a  Spanis hPort uge se 
fa mi ly in my  class, and he was 
the rabbi of the uh I 
think, I believe the 
one  a nd only Spa nish 
synagogue in uh a

in my cl assr oom,  and I  
thi nk t hat she  al so wa s 
called out. I'm not, I couldn
't uh vouc h for t hat . But c h

Obviousl y t h at le ft  s o me i mpres si
on on all of us child

 what e xtent  t het

 it  al so creat ed a great  deal 
of uncertainity 
and insecurit y 
of our  pa rent s as  that did i n its el f must  have
 bee n fe lt by t he chil dren. Then t he ne xt big

10th of No vemb er, 1938
 - the Kristallnacht. An

that feeling of 
fear sur faced all over agai n and 
I could feel  it li ke  I fel t  it  
as a child of si

As  I s

I didn't understand it 
until recent years when
 I have read many 
stories of other people like my self wh o came 
from German fa milies 
and where the feeli ng 
was exactly the same, wh
ere the attitude was the 
same. They were Germ

in Germany for generati ons. Uh 
I know that my  mother's  fa mil

for  a lit tle bit over t w o hundred

thor ough job, s o I ' m sur e that I  c an go bac k
 much further. Uh my 
fat h er 's  fa mi l y  e v e n  
though he was bor n i n wh
ich was the heart of Prussia, uh 
under  Ame rica n la
w after the after 
the uh 1st World War  it had been ceased ( ph)  
t o Poland and accordi ng
 to Ameri can law it 
wa s Poli sh a nd ther e for e he we nt  on t he Polis
h quota, which ca
used all the problems that it 
caus ed tha t  we  coul dn't get t o Ame r i ca be fore 
the war. But nevertheless
, he in his own heart 
wa s a  Ger ma n a nd had al wa ys  be en a Ger ma n . An
d uh I have to say th
at  t o day perha ps  I ca n 
underst and it  muc h bette r that t h
ey had such trust that this co
uld never happe n t o t he m. Uh I  
don't  know how, I don't really
 know how mu ch would an Amer
ic an Je w who has  be en her e 
for several generat ions, i f the same sit ua
tion woul d confront  hi m, t hough he  ha s t he 
experience of only fi fty years 
ago in the in the back of hi
s mind, but how 
much would he 
fe el that something so 
drastic, so total an
d so inhuman could take pl
ac e. I I ' m no
t sure. But 
nevertheless this was the fe elin
g. So t hat my par ents di d no
t register very early for t he 
Ameri can quota. My mot her and 
I  bot h havi ng bee n
 born in Ge rmany 
had not, no great 
proble ms . The quota , our  quota  ca me  up ver y 
qui c kly, a nd we  coul d ha ve l eft  for Amer i ca 
sever al ti me s  be fore  lea vi ng for  Alba nia. I  thin
k we  were  call e d to t he 
Consule at  least t wi ce 
if not three times. Howe
ver, my father  acc ordi ng t o  Ame ric
a n la w,  we nt on
 the Po lish quota, 
and that was a smal l quot a and 
this  wa s, and he ha d a high 
numb er beca use  many ea ster n 
Eur opean Jews had regi st ered 
much much earl ier. And of cour
s e we were n't  goi ng to lea v e 
wit hout hi m, so needl ess  to 
s ay eac h ti me  we  ga ve  up our qu
ota  and some one 
els e possibly 
left i n our  ste ad. I beli eve  di
d. So  that here in
 the, a nd the  uh M eyer  fa mil y had not 
regist ered early so they r e ally could not le
a ve Ha mbur g. The y had t o also fi nd a not her  
asylum. And it wa s exactly that. It
 was a sear ch for  an asyl um 
no matter wher
e. And uh the 
passibilities were very 
very slim. They 
thought of England. We ll 
England requi
red quite a 
substantial amount of mo ney as 
the security deposit for every 
one t hat  uh e n tered Engl and. 
I 'm not  s ure what t he  a m ount wa s a n d I  don't t hin
k t hat my pa rents  c oul d have  a fforde d that, 
and neithe r a ppar entl y could the  
uh Meyer fa mily, so 
t hat  we ha d t o fi nd ot her wa ys out . Uh 
my  father I believe had uh - 
no, not I believe, I kno
w -  ha d cousins  in Ar
gentina. Wasvery 
difficult to get into 
Ar ge ntina. You ha d t o prove t h at 
you were  some  how or  ot her uh 
connect ed pr ofessionally to ag
ric ultur e, and of c ourse t hat  
he  c oul dn't prove . He  was  a 
busi nes s ma n, thr ough a nd thr ough. So that 
wa s out . So s o me how, 
and I'm not quite a 
hundred percent sure how this 
Albania uh possibility surfaced, 
but what I had heard always 
wa s my  mo t h er ha d me t t h e Al ba

 Ger many at  a

the conversation it turned out th
at he  wa s a bout t o  be  marri

some  money. He  got us  i n ret ur n
, per haps not  in r eturn -  I don'
t want  to ma ke it  s ound t hat 

this was a bribery. I thi

st ly wa s able to officially give them vi sas to 
go to Alba ni a. And uh Dr . M eye

obtai ne d t he uh Al ba nia n visas  a nd our  pa ssports  
or a letter - I'm not qu

use my grandmother was 
not allowed to know 
at that poi nt t hat my mot h er 
was going to take an

how does anybody go 
i nto an air plane. Bu
t  nevert hele ss when 
she came  safely back the sa me evening she wa

relief that she didn't

mysteri ously be ga n. My r ecolle

Grandmother because we could not think of ta

conside r  my sel f not  a n ol d pers

e coul d not  thi nk of taki ng her 
to a pri mative country like Albani
a and this is all we
 kne w about  Alba nia . Uh s he  was  l eft  
alone in Hamburg with an olde

that she she al
one would still 
ma ke  it to America were  fairly
 good, although
 she  too by coi nc iden

(ph) . I  believe that my gra ndfat
her  fro m my  fat h er 's fa mi l y  an

in Po sen of course. Uh  but uh 
at  any rate she was on t he Polis

chance to just leave her in 
Ha mburg. That was ver y  sa d.
 Uh  my  my  parents uh now 
proc eeded to unravel a ll t heir a f
fair s i n Ha mbur g. We  had to gi

give  our home . Uh and we  thou

wit h t he American Consule to 
the American Consule 
in , which indeed we
 di d a nd that we 
wo uld go to Albania for a period
 of maybe four  mont hs, fi ve mont hs, hal f a year . Uh I ' m not  
eve n s ure  tha t  the y t hought it woul d t a ke t hat
 long. Consi deri ng and uh
 t hinki ng ba ck of the 
a mount of lugga ge  that  we to
ok with us, and t he ki nd of cl
ot he s  we t ook 
with us, it was 
really consi d ered only a matt er 
of mo nths that we  wo uld be in
 Albania. Uh  the rest of our 
belongi ngs, t hat whic h we were  
all o wed t o t ake  out, beca use  he re we  are , Ja nuar y, Febr uary, 
1939. We 're  not  allowed t o ta ke  
out a n y sil ver . We 're not allowe d t o ta ke  out mar e t ha n 10 
mar ks  per pe rson. Uh we 're not allowe d t o ta ke
 out any jewelry. We 'r
e not allowed to take 
out  many ot her t hings , nothi ng tha t  was ne wl
y purchased. I 
me an t here  wer e very ver y 
speci fic uh r ules  and regulations . I  be lieve  tha t  
i n my papers  at  ho me i n Hai fa  I even ha ve 
lists of things my  parent
s took with them. I have I think a do
c u me nt t hat  sta t es uh tha t  you're 
onl y all o we d to take out  t hings t hat  were pur ch
a se d one  year pr ior t o your uh i m mi grati o n 
and things of that sort
. I me an everyt hing wa s ma de ver y cl
ear . The y pac ke d a  li ft  (ph) under  
the supervision of German uh of
fi cials. Everyt hing was checked,
 what we nt  i n t here , a nd uh 
these lift s were left  in 
the stora ge  of the harbor
 i n Ha mbur g wi th t he i nte nti on that  as  s o on as  
we  wo uld  ar rive i n Ame r ica we  wo
ul d s end for t h ese li fts. I  be lieve  tha t  at  t he ti me  t he  r ule 
wa s that you could not just simp ly
 s end off your li f t  to the  Un

beca use  I thi nk the  Unit e d State s, or  t he har bor
 of Ne w Yor k woul d have be en fl oode d with 
lift s of peopl e who unfort unat ely ne ve r made it  
themselves there.
 So  our lift wa s left in uh 
Ha mbur g, in the  uh har bor of
 Ha mbur g, and uh we  le ft Ha mb
ur g on uh I  bel i eve  the  date  
wa s t he 23r d of Febr uar y, 1939. At  le a st this i s
 what the official exit 
docume nt t hat I have  
states. Uh my father had a ve
ry hard time detaching himsel
f fr om literally thousands of 
letters , doc ume nts , photographs , e t c. I t  was  i mposs
ible t hat  he c oul d ta ke  all  of t hes e t hings 
that were very dear to
 him and that mean
t so much to him.
 These were letters still written by 
his mot her t o  hi m whe n he wa
s  in the war . Uh his  younger 
brot her ha d fa lle n for Ger ma ny 
eighteen days before the end of
 Wo
rl d Wa r I. He's buried 
somewhere in France. Uh his 
mother , as I stated be
for e , alr eady died when
 s he wa s uh a young wo
ma n i n  Fe br uary of 
1919. She  ha d gone t o Be rlin t o
 wa it for hi m a s he  arrive d. He had bee n suc h  a patri ot t hat  
although t he  war  e nde d i n  No
ve mber of 1918, he  ha d vol unte ere d t o fi ght  a g ainst  the 

Bolsheviks (ph) 
and went into Russia an
d never came back fr om
 the war until February 
1919. Uh s h e was  in Berl in. Sh
e  a wait ed hi m at t he  railr oad 
st ati on. And someti me duri ng 
that peri od she contract ed as I  sai d t h e Spanis
h I n fluenza. She  we nt bac k t o  Pose n and died 
very s hortl y therea fter . And he
 c oul d not  even go t o her fu
neral  be cause he  wa s a  Ger ma n 
soldi er, or  e x -soldier. Pos en by 
this time was Polish 
and I don't think that 
he got uh a  pe r mit  
to go into Posen. Uh
 I believe a little bit later on, pr
obably 1920, everyone who lived in 
Posen was given the option to opt
 for either the Poli
sh citizenship or 
German citizenship, 
and of c our s e my gr andfather  uh opt e d a nd 
a nd pa rt of the othe r fa mil y opte d for t he

German citizenship, and th
ey all went to live in
 Berlin. So as of 1920,
 I believe that uh all 
whoe ver  was  le ft in Pose n of the  fa mil y Ger
echt er and whatever else t heir  names were al l 
went to live in Berlin. But to 
come  back to our own fa mily, so 
I re me mber s o  ver y disti nct ly 
my  father making arrangements 
wit h the superi nte nde nt of t h
e  buil ding whe r e we  live d, t hat 
he could use the fur nace r oom 
of the house and burn all wh at
 he  couldn't  ta ke with hi m. 
Papers , doc ume nts , e t c. et c. He  t ook s o me  th

ry few. We  were so 
li mit ed in our ba ggage  a n d our  lugga ge that it  wa
s really uh very diffic
ult t o deci de what  to 
take  and what not t o take . Uh it
 ca me  to t he poi nt  where  my mo
ther  a nd fat her ha d t o go to 
the uh customs official s and gi ve
 them, hand them ov

their...anythi ng, a ny obje cts i n t he  house  that  
were made of silver, no
ne  of which c oul d be 
take n al ong. The  uh cutl e ry a nd 
uh you know, whatever uh else 
was of silver in the house. 
Uh I do remember my 
mother going out 
and being permitted to buy th
ree sets of cutlery, of 
uh silver-pl a ted cutle ry to be  ta ken wit h us. 
One for  eac h of us , a nd 
nothing mo re. An d her 
jewelry. Wh en they came to 
the customs official, some one 
recognized her,
 a n elder ly 
gentl e men a nd it t urned out  that  one  t i me  he 
worked for my gr andfathe r, possibl y t en or  
fi ft een years earlier  in hi s busi nes

her, he al lowed her  to ta ke 
just a few extra items al

otherwise all they were permitte
d re al ly wa s t heir  we ddi ng ring
s, and as I said, a set of uh 
three sets of cutlery fo
r each of us. Uh she 
was allowed very fe w ad
ditional items, and those 
items were in this pla
ce, packed in a sealed 
little package. I still see 
the package in fr ont of 
me . It wa s very small and it 
was seal ed wit h seal- locker,
 act ually sealed, and I  guess 
included wa s a list of items that
 we re i n it . And a c opy of t h
at li st, whe n we  fi nall y le ft 
Ger ma n y a n d cr os sed the  Pa ss  int o It a l y, that
 list was over there with
 the customs official,

the package at that place was

 parents were 
still packing. I re member the last
 night in our

rewell to toys
 and everything 
else and of course the very ve

.see her standing 
on her  balcony and wa vi ng at us  as

And uh we  tr avele d t o M unic h

That 's  for s ur e, and we  know

 Hamb urg, and that's 
all we  ha d with us. We  ar rived 
in Bol o gne  the next  day, and uh here  we didn't know what  
we  would be  doing beca use t he 
ten ma rks by now had been used
 up t he one night  in M uni ch 
and uh the Meyer family 
of fi ve  and the  thr ee  stood on t h

didn't  know where  to tur n. To our  gr e at s urpri

to be t her e a nd uh re ceive Ger ma n or other  i m

for us for an entire week until 
we wer e a ble t o re

and the s a me  went  for  t he  Me yer fa mil y. Uh t h

dis patc h ed, a nd I gue ss 
in t hos e days  uh tel egr a m wa s alr eady i n e xis

don't know how quickly 
it went. But we were for an entir

took us around town , showed us Bo

 for, first of all fr om
 for our ticket, railroad

took a boat t o Al bani

allowed to pay for these 
t wo tri pls , be caus e t his  was out  of
 terr itorial  Ger many. They woul d 
not allow us to pay with Ge

ese two tickets, which would 
have ma de  li fe  a  lot  ea sie r  and, but t hi s were  
all  cal culated on the part 
of the German

ever ythi ng el se, all bel ongings, were  put  in

 Ha mb urg, many ma ny y

already were no l onger al ive, 
and the German cour t some how f

wa s a lift  stored in a certain ma n's uh  wa

cont ents  of not onl y our  li ft  but I  s uppose  many
 ot her pe ople 's  uh li fts , had bee n distri buted 
to so-called bombed-

 the glorious amount of $400 
American dollars, or was it 400 
marks - I'm not quite sure a
nymore - uh maybe sometime in 
the earl y earl y '60's as compensa

yway, we 'r e now uh in uh Bologne. As  I 
said we uh were ta ke n car e, 
bea uti fully taken car e of by t hes e pe ople  a nd it i s  only wee ks

Italian Jews and Italy and its Je

I  thi nk. Unfort un

doe sn't me nt ion Alba nia  at all , and I ' m tryi ng
 to get in touch with
 her which I haven't

think it's a pity that sh

Anywa y, we  now le ave  for Bari , and i m me diat el

... We  arri ved on M arch 1s t, 1939, i n t h e earl y, e a
rly hours of the mo rning.
 We went up on board and 
the site  that  uh we sa w was one  of e xt r e me depr
ess i on. It  was  a  one  doc k a n d port , piles  and 
piles, heaps and heaps of char
coal on the pier . It  was pour
ing rain. The black water was 
everywhere, running all 
over t he pi er from t he char coal . Th
ere were fe w uh Albanians, for 
the most  part  gypsi es be c ause  they us e...used
 to use gypsies for th
eir heavy wo rk and for 
carryi ng a nd so on. Cove r ing thei
r, and t his I kept  seeing i t 
all  t hrough t he years whenever it 
raine d, these  pe opl e woul d use  as  a pr otecti on just
 the j ute  ba gs  over t heir  heads  a nd thi s  is 
was t he sight  that  met  our  eyes. 
It  was  really real ly depr essi
ng . An d I re me mb er my  mo ther 
crying bitterly and saying 
I am not leaving this 
ship. I am going to st
raight back to . She 
abs olute ly c oul d not  envi sion how
 she  woul d ever be able  to 
s et  foot t o t his  kind of a  
unbelie vabl y de pres sing uh si ght . Well  again to 
our surprise , bec ause  we  reall y had no i de a 
what was expecti ng us 
i n  Al ba nia , uh there  were  ot her 
i m mi gra nts, Eur ope a n i m mi gra nt s 
already in Al bani a, an
d some one fr om the pier
 call e d up in Ger man, are t her e any Ger man 
Je ws, are there any Je ws  on bo ar
d?  And uh we  we re very ha
ppy t hat t his  ge ntle ma n who 
had alre ady bee n i n Al ba nia, th
is was his job to be there ever
y day when boa ts arri ve d t o see 
whether t her e would be r efugees on t hese boat s. 
And uh s o he helpe d us
 get off the boat and 
uh take us t o  one of t he  local hot
els. Well ho...hotel is
 a n ove rstat e ment  of fact s, but  that 's 
what t he y were c alle d. Excee ding...e veryt hin
g wa s e xcee dingl y pri mati ve. Uh we  ha d, 
coming from Hamb urg, uh hygien
e being the epitomy of
 our  lives a nd s o o
n, this was really 
unbelie vabl e . But  neve rtheless  here we were . 
Uh I  don't  know. We  c h
ildren perhaps because 
of our  age, by t his ti me
 I had just turned my  
eighth birt hda y in Dec e mb
er before we left , and 
uh the  uh chi l dren of t he fa mi l y Me yer , one  wa
s  younger -  I  beli eve  he
 was  only five  -  and 
uh the  ot her , the t he  girl s -  on
e was a year older t han mysel f
 and on e wa s exactly the sa me  
age. So  I don't know 
ta  what exte nt we c oul d e mp athas
ize with the feeling our parents 
experienced. I think that to 
us some of this 
was exciting because 
it was new and it was 
di fferent and and it  was j ust a
ll uh a new experi ence fo
r us  chil dren. I  t hin
k at thi s poi nt we  
uh we wer e certai nly ver y i nsec ure  be caus e 
we  didn't know what was facing us or wh at 
school  woul d be li ke  or  t he us ual t hi n gs t hat  
childr en do - t oys, we  ha
d almo st none with us, 
just what we could car
ry in our arms or our
 little bag that 
each one of us 
had over their 
shoulder, and uh I do reme mb er
 very well that for ma ny ma
ny ye ars the  one  thi ng tha t  I 
missed so terribly was my  scho
ol bag, and I al ways  ha d i n t h
e back of my  mind, well one 
day when I get to live 
i n Ne w Yor k, my s chool  bag wa s . 
I n Ger ma n y we  us ed to wea r  the  
school  ba g on your on your bac k. I ha d s o me  pa
rticular like for this 
I suppose. I don't know 
exactly why, but that was so important to me th
at I did not have that
 wi
th me. Uh another 
thing I  had r eceived as a 
gi ft fr om an uncl e of my mother
's a doll house that he had made 
hi msel f a nd of c ouse I ha d t o le ave  that behi nd
, ne edles s t o say, a n
d that wa s a tremendous 
uh and I  mis sed it ver y badly. We
ll, t hese ar e t he t hings t hat  children of t hat  age I  thi nk we 
experiencing. The lack of the uh
 us usa l , t he schooli ng, t he fri

the family the grandparents, et
c. Uh but the other insecuritie
s of where does 
the next meal 
come  from or where are we  goin
g t o l ive and wher e are we go
i ng to slee p a nd so on whi ch 
pare nts  ha ve  to worry about, I t h

Vienna. Uh had rented or I shou

ttle bit differently at
 this point. There 
wer e Al bani an Je ws  and that i s t o say there  
were  two fa milies originally fr om Greece  who 
had lived for  many year s in Al bani a a nd the y
 were  consi dere d Albani an Je ws . Uh t here  
na mes  were  uh Kohn (ph) and Le

e dr y goods store s a nd uh the y 
were we al...very Jews. Th
eir origin as I say was fr om Sol
oni ka  (ph) I  believe a nd uh when 
these other people had arrived a 
little bit earlier than we, I do
n't believe that
 anybody was 
there  mor e  t han ma ybe  a  ye ar
 longer than we . In other 
words i n  1938 I  beli e ve i s 
i mmi grati on to Al bani a s t arted. Uh t he se people
 ha d s ort of as s u med the r ol e of uh t o t he  
highest to the Joint Distribution 
in Ameri ca . M ade c onta ct wit h
 them, and they were sending 
Ameri can dollars t o t hese two fa

Albani an equival ent  of t his 
money. But in all these years they made very 
nice uh currency out of 
t hese Jews that came 
to t o t o e sca pe Ge r many. Neve r mi nd. At  a ny 
rate  uh the se pe ople ha d orga nize d t he ms e lves  
in uh the y ha d re nte d a  ve ry ve

str eet fr om t he  fir st one  but 
had not completed the arrangem

original home, and had to live in
 this hotel. So it 
wa s us and uh the Me

wer e a  c oupl e of ot her  c o uple s 
or single people who 
i n t he me a nti me were  s t aying i n one  or  
the other of these hotels
. I think at that time  
there were just  two. (_
_____) On e was called . 
The  ot her  one was  call ed, and uh 
but for me als we had to qo ev
eryday to thi s hoste l whic h 
was perhaps not  a l ong way. I don'
t  really r ecall . I do recal l t hat  
as a chil d it  wa
s a trecher ous 
waly to walk. You have 
to reme mber that uh ro
ads as such weren't re
allly known in Albania 
and it was al l ver y uh muddy. Th
is was the rainy season in Fe
br uary a nd Ma rch i nto Apri l, 
and uh we had to go tw
ice a day for meals to th
e home, to the uh hostel
. And it wasn't  until a 
fe w months l ater, and I 'm not  
quite sure exactly wh
ether  it was May or  J une  that t he  se cond 
host el had be en r ente d and when
 we c oul d move , be move d i n 
there. OK. Uh 
so this us 
proc edure he re we nt on al l thr o
ugh March and into Ap ril. April 
5th, 1939, we woke up t o  a 
barra ge  of ca nnon uh s hot s. 
And we di dn't quite  know what
 it was. We  were told 
immediat ely that the royal family
 had j ust uh the Quee n of Al

an heir  to the  thr one  a nd uh t hey were  shoo

he Ki ng of 
Albania, King uh offe red that 
t he se sixty or ma ybe by now si xt
y-fi ve  or  se ve nty i m migr a nts 
Albani an citi zens hip in honor of

ha d ta ken pl ace  but in the  e nd histor y prove d t hat i t would 
have bee n te rrible  i f it  ha d happe ned, beca use  
we  wo uld never have gotten out of Albania. . 
Two days later we again were 
awoken by terrible uh noises of
 artilleries shooting but this 
time  it was the real th

was  the  wee k of Pass over . Pa ss over 
wa s e arly tha t part icul ar year. I belie ve  I l ooked
 up in my book e arlie

It was a solid

Some of them ar e even i n t he

became a necessit y. And 
anyway uh t he ne xt 
really traumatic experience in my 
li fe was t he fact  that uh my 
mother  became te
rribly ill. We  
were still in the hostel and it 
was still the summer of
 1939, and she was 
diagnosed as being, 
suffering fr om uh typhoid fe ve
r and so she was ill fo
r a good numbe
r of weeks before fi nally 
some body decide d well i t  ha s 
t o be typhoid fever a nd she 
wa s t ake n by a mbulance t o a 
hospital in , , the capital city 
but at that ti
me her condition had dete
riorated tremendously. 
She  ra n ver y  hi gh te mper ature q
 for al most a mont h duri ng wh
ich time she was hallucinating 
constant ly. She l ost  a tre me ndous a m ount of

somet hing li ke uh 35 or 40 k
ilos  a nd uh I  di dn't see  her  for 
uh al most four weeks , and my  
fat her  feared the wor st. In fact
 he didn't take me  there becaus
e he was afraid 
that I  wouldn't  
recogniz e he r or  or  a nyti me  he we nt t here  
uh he woudn't try to. 
She she couldn't be 
pers
uaded to eat  or  dri nk any of the, a gain, 
what  was i n t hose days  us ed real ly I  mea n, 
penecillin was nonexistent.
 Sulfur drugs were non
existent yet. These ar
e things that perhaps 
wo uld have cured it quickly. 
Uh I ' m not  sur e  wha t  dr ugs  we

cure  for  typhoid fever i s yougur
t  and mil k beca us e  both of th
em evi dentall y cont ain cer tain 
antibodi es that can fight 
t he bact eria . And she would ha ve  no
ne of it. So  she was for a very 
long time really very
 very ill. She did come
 out of it finally. Some
 Italian doctor in the 
hos pital  trea t ed her , I ' m not 
sure with wh at. Wh en she fi
nally came back
 to it was a 
tre mendous  j oy for  me , but i n my
 own life  the fear from was 
a  tre mendousl y re al one . Uh I  
realize d t hat  she  was  ver y  ver y sic k a n d I  real

very re al. And I  ha ve  to te ll you tha t uh I  los t

 she was fift y-

One  one side , one bedr

The anter oom is wher e t he guar

unbelie vabl y . It had a  cla y ove n I  re me mber , 
and lots and lots of 
rats and mice walking

 no uh bathroom facilitie

thouse, even in a place

fi nd a n out door bathtub whic h 
I  gue ss was us ed by the la dies

so called harem which I

much mor e nort hler nly l ocate d t ha n Durats o 
a nd  it was  a ver y  col d wi nter . Uh  we  were  
living, well for me first of all,
 it  was  fun a gai n. A huge  garde n
, pomgrani tes  (ph)  gr ew i n the 
garden. I  pi c ked the m. 
And low and behol d t her e wa s a  dog,
 a fe ma le dog, a bitch in the 
basement somewhere, 
who had given birth to these th
ree little puppies. 
And must have 
happe ned jus t as  we arrived. 
To me t h is was great  excitement
. Ver y good uh 
much fun, and 
uh one morning, by chan
ce, I s a w a n Albani an boy who ha
d chased the mother away and 
was about to take the 
puppies away. And 
the puppies were no mo re
 than uh ma ybe a week 
or two old - they didn't 
see yet. In other 
words they really were very
 little, and uh I guess my 
father  must have  told me  that
 I  ma
y ha ve one of t he se puppie s
. So I argued w
ith this young 
uh boy and i nde ed he  di d gi ve 
me  t he puppy t hat I  wa nte d. It
 was a  whit e a n d blac k puppy. 
And uh now I ha d my 
puppy. And I  c alled my 
puppy Pi cholo ( ph)  ev

fe ma le  and s he shoul d ha ve bee n calle d Pic hol

three and a half years of her 
life . And uh she grew into a ve
ry loving and 
lovely little dog, 
absolutely 57 varieties, but that
 di dn't bot her me . Uh we  ha d to, 
we  fe d her l i t erally with a  uh 
milk bottle that belonged to 
one of my dolls I s
uppose and uh I don't 
even know where we 
got  the  mil k fr om bec aus e I 'm s ure  my mother
 didn't  ha ve  enough mi
l k for me , but  I do 
remember t h at she bought the 
uh can of condensed 
milk and watered that
 down, and that's 
what the poor little puppy lived 
on fo r a while, and 
I also remember that
 one day she made 
some cream of wheat and it bur
ned on these wonderfu
l uh cooking fac
ilities, and somehow 
that became food for t his
 baby uh dog, puppy, fo
r a  fe w da ys. As long 
as it was sour - the

 t hat was t he  uh c entra l poi nt 
of my li fe at thi s poi nt. The  
dog wa s e ve r ythi ng. The 
dog me ant  a great  de al t o me , and 
uh my pare nts  very muc h li ked 
this dog as well, so I didn't ha

 keeping the dog in 
the house. I could 
keep the dog wi th me 
all the time. And uh I,
 we  really became  ve
ry close fr iends and it 
beca me  uh a I ha d no ot

The dog wa s a  very uh ce

with Italy, between Italy and uh
 It al...Gre ece  start e d very s hortl y t herea fter . We  li ved ver y 
close  to a  mosque , a nd uh what 
we  didn't know was that the 
mosque  ha d be en use d by t he 
Italians as a storage place for 
a m munit i on. The  fr ont line  was  qu ite cl ose . At  night we  c ould 
see the artillery fire, the flashing
 uh fl aming up of 
of projectiles - we c
ould see them. And uh 
the city of or this village of 
was bomb ed very very often. Th

were bombed I

we  reall y di dn't  ha ve  any mone y,
 and t here was a period exactl y

END OF TAPE  

 

OK. Uh we wer e bac k I  belie ve i n Durats o. We  wer e
, OK, at this point uh we
 were no longer being 
support ed as  I sai d by the Jo
int. We were no lo
nger supported by th
e  uh uh Al bani an 
government and uh work
ing per mi t  a s  such was  i m pos si
ble to obtain. You have to 
remember that this is a very 
small country with a ve
ry li mited uh indust
r y a n d very li mite d 
resource s of any ki nd. Uh and 
so my father  once again reso
rte d  to his  painti ng. Uh he 
continued actually wh at he had st
arted in , uh in , to
 paint the store signs 
and uh he eve n got . 
some  uh jobs with th
e uh hi ghwa y de part me nt t o do si
gns  whe r e c ons truct i on was  taki ng 
place and things of this sort. 
Ho we ver, that didn't really 
amount to mu ...enough mo ney and 
at thi s ti me , at thi s poi nt, we  were  livi ng out of 
the, out in the 
uh on the uh fa

to c all it  a  fa r m, but  that 's  reall y what  i t  was ,
 and uh together with ye
t anothe r  fa mil y, frie nds 
of our s, and uh the  t wo fa mili es
, my parent s a nd these pe ople , 
Mundle  (ph)  was  thei r na me , 
Fee nie  (ph) a nd Walte r ( p h) M undle , uh deci de
d that they were  goi ng
 to uh wa sh laundr y 
for It alia n uh truc k dri ver s. Uh i f  I  thi nk ba ck
 of the uh l aundr y busi n
ess, I somehow have to 
chuckle. The aut o mati c washer s and t h e automa
t i c dryer s and t h e runni
ng water and the hot 
wat er a nd e v erythi ng el se . I  don't know what  
they used for so...for
 soap, quite obviously. 
One of t h
e  things  that wa s  uh
 popular in Albania 
to use was the the ashes of charcoal.  
It's  fantastic to cl
ean your clothes with. I don'
t know how fa ntastic
, but that was one 
of the additives 
to a washing machine, to a wa
sher . The washing machi ne consi s
ted of a uh uh tin cylindric 
uh bucket I guess you could call it, 
tall, fairly tall buck
et with a little kind 
of a uh tube! in the 
middle into which you pu
t charcoal and you lit 
the charcoal and that
 would warm up the 
wat e r.  No w i f  y ou  were  n ot c a
re full e n ough and you had your  la
undry touch that part  of t he 
kettlel, uh you could even get it 
burned. At any rate, 
it would be boiled in
 there, and then it 
would be put  on a  ta ble, s crubb
ed with a brush, and 
of cours e ri nse d. No
w my job in all of 
this was to pull water fr om
 the uh well. We  had a 
little well in th
e uh in our, in front of our 
house , but  that was  the dr inki ng
 water and the washing water an
d e ver y othe r  ki nd of wate r,

and uh i f  it  wa s t o wards the su
mmer and in Albania it doesn't ra
in like in in 
Israel you only 
have a  rai n period, uh the wa
t er very quickl y get s e xha uste
d and (______) 
bottom of your 
well and then you have to
 wait  for s e veral  hour s 
t o st art fi lling up a gai n.
 At  any r ate I, that 
was my job - to fill up 
buckets and buckets of 
water uh for the laundr
y, for wash
ing and for 
dryi ng the  la undry. And of c our se  the n t he 
laundry was hung in th
e back yard and my  
mother  woul d ir on, a nd a gain, 
ir oning was  done  wi th a  ste a m 
ir on, but  a big 
heavy uh iron 
iron, which ope ne d up a nd you put 
burni ng charcoal i nto it  in 
order  t o heat  
it. How do you 
iron without heat? All of
 t hese  thi ngs t oda y are l augha ble  bu
t they weren't so
 laughable then. 
They were pretty seri ous. It wa
s a li vi ng for us for a 
good numb er of years,
 a t leas t t w o, t wo, 
two a nd a  ha lf ye ars  and uh my par ents c onti nued 
doi ng thi s s o rt of thi ng. What  di d I  do i n 
all of this time? My d
og was with me for sure. 
Out i n t he on t he far m, thi s onl y danger  really 
wa s uh snake bit es 
and t hat was not  s o far - fetc he d  and it
 was  al so da nger ous
 for us. In fa ct 
my mother once found a snake in
 her  bed whe n she went at  ni
ght to bed. Uh
 the uh thing 
that I  I  had a carefree li fe in 
t he sense  t hat school ing a s s u
c h for  a while  I didn't  atte nd. 
Ag ain, all through 
the uh mo nth or however lo
ng we  were  in t he t w o 
uh little cities in the 
center  of t he country, i n a nd , ot her i m mi gran
ts wer e tea chi ng me. I  di d a gre at deal of 
readi ng and I  today speak, read, 
and wr ite a  pe r fect  Ger ma n  and it
's only due to the efforts of 
all these lovely people
 and my own tr e mendous
 hunger for  rea ding. 
I r ead a  gre at deal . 
Wh atever came  into my  hand, be 
it Italian or be it 
Ger ma n , I  re ad it . And 
this was really the 
basis of my uh education until I 
came to the United St
ates at the age of 
15. Uh my parents 
however they did it is still is a 
uh miracle and uh a puzzle t o me
, but  the y ke pt me  uh fair ly 
hap...uh ha ppy and we ll- adjusted
 c hil d. I c an't say 
that I uh was not 
well-adjusted and I 
cannot  sa y t h at I ha d a  ter r ible 
childhood. The dangers
 per haps I  di dn't under stand t hat  we ll. 
Uh for a part  of our li fe i n  Al
ba nia  we wer e more or les s s a fe
 and and secure. Uh the uh lack 
of uh material values wa sn't  th
at something that matte
re d t o me  as  a chil d so muc h. We  li ved 
out  on t he fa r m. That wa s  fun. 
There wa s a cow. I learne d to 
mi lk. I had s o me c hickens . Uh 
I coll ected t h eir eggs. Uh eventu
ally my mother found out that 
t here was an aft ernoon It alian 
school  taught by nuns. She re gi
ster ed me and she t
ook me  there  uh a nd I star ted l ear ning 
how to read and write Italian. 
Uh the following 
sc hool  ye ar I  wa s act uall y r e gister ed int o the 
third gr ade  - I ha d gone  in Ge
r m
a ny in Ha mbur g j us t  to the  
fir st grade and a few month,s 
into the  s econd gra de . They t ook
 me into the third grade. The 
s chool was t a ugh
t by nuns . It  
is alwa ys my  favor
ite thing to say that I wa
s  taught by uh I  was  t aug
ht i n a nunner y. Uh nuns 
did teac h me , a nd they were l
ovely. They were very good to
 me . The y kne w I was  Je wi sh. 
There were some kids i n t he cl
as s a s well, but  for one year , on
e school  ye ar, I reall y li ve d a 
nor mal , uh st ude nt li fe. I we nt i n t he  morni ng 
to s chool and I  c a me 
home  in the  a ft ernoon. 
Uh we  ha d t o dres s i n unifor ms
 like all Italian chil
dren. A bl ac k s moc k wit h a  whit e c ol l ar 
and a blue big bow. Uh  the nuns 
were good to me. They were no
t pres suri ng unduly let 's say 
honestl y. Nuns do not wa lk 
by the ms e lves . They're  al wa ys
 acc ompani ed by some one , and 
so at ti me s I would a
ccompany my favorit e nun 
from s chool  t o her uh domici le whic h was  a 
hospital in in uh Durats
o. She  would a sk me  t o
 c o me  to c hur ch wi th
 me, to take  her  t o 
chur ch. Uh s he woul d oc cassi ona
lly say, wh y, wh y don't you 
kneel down and pray with me. 
Not hi ng will  ha ppen to you. 
And be si des , why do you people
 s u ffer  so muc h. You re ally 
coul d save your  sufferi ng. But  t h
at was the most  that
 I ever experienced 
in uh uh the sense 
of being pre s sure d i nto uh acc epti ng or  beli evi ng 
in Cat holi cis m.  I have t o honestl y say they 

never pres sured us . They never, 
no one e very tal ke d a bout ba pti s m or  a nyt hi ng of that  s o rt at 
all. So for one year, as I  sa

morni ng, a n d I  loved it . I  love
d it so much that in
 the morning when I 
we nt  to s c hool , I  
regret ed the fact t hat  anot he
r da y wa s goi ng by, and it  was  
one less day of going to school 
till the vacat i on came. 
And t his was the only year
 - this is t he year 19
42-43. Uh ( ______)  we 
had als o uh ma de  frie nds  wi th 
an Albanian fa mily. 
Uh t heir  na me  is  . He was a  c ons truc tion 
or a  ci vil engineer . She was Ger ma n , a nd the y
 had two sons. Uh  mo st
 Al ba ni ans  who st udy 
anyt hing -  t h ere wa s no univer sity uh i n Alba

Ger ma n y, pe rhaps he eve n we nt
 t o England. I ' m no
t sure. But this wa
s the norm. Anybody 
wh o uh had a profession had b
een to s tudy a broad. 
And uh this partic ular  engine er had 
studi ed in Ger many a nd met  a n
d married a Ger man wo ma n, w
ho I assume had had adapted 
uh herself to the religio
n - I don't know what the proced
ure of becoming a Moslem woma n 
is or  not , but  she c ertai nl y brought up her  
children in the Moslem 
faith. Uh interesting 
indi vidual  and uh I 'd li ke  t o 
dwell on her for a  moment onl y be
cause it is such 
a very typical 
story. We  were her  so- ca lled 
court Je ws. She wa s su
c h a  str ong supporter  of Hi tler. I n he r 
living room she had a tr
emendous colo
red portrait of Hitler. He
r, she came from which is 
the beginning, which was the be
ginning of Hitler's little band
 of supporters. She enjoyed 
telling us of the fact that uh in
 the late twenties 
and early thirties when
 national socialism 
was still illegal in Germ
any, during the 
Republic, uh secret me etings
 with Hitler 
took place 
in t he bas e ment of her  fat her 's home , a nd 
you ca nnot, she woul d 
tell me mother, the 
charisma of this ma
n, t hese eyes -  
I mea n a nd s he woul d r ea lly go int o al l ki nds  
of e s ctasy descri bing thi s ( ______) phe nome nal  
huma n bei ng that  this H
itler was and so on. But she was Al
ba nia n a nd s he li ved i n It aly, I  
me an in in Albani a, 
and she was a a good wo
ma n. She  would c o me out  to t he far m whe r e 
we  lived and bri ng us  food, and 
uh when the chips were down, that is to say in 1943 when 
uh, well  I don't  ha ve  to re peat  the  hi st ory 
whic h i s already known, but  e ve n tually t he 
Germans regarded t he Ital ians 
as their enemies and 
they act uall y occupied
 Al bani a, and uh 
to t he extent  where they depor
t ed the I talians by trucks , vi
a bac k  int o It aly. And the y 
became t he r ulers of Al
bs nia. Uh at  thi s po
int, it became very da
ngerous. We were in 
Du ratso - oh, I have really sk
ipped something that is most 
important, and wh
ere t he famil y 
came in very much. Uh a little 
bit earlier on, I suppose it must
 have been - 
well, let's go 
bac k. I I ' m a fraid we have  to go bac k t o 
1942. In 1942, first of
 all the Ger mans are 
occ upying Yugosla via, a n d a  
gr oup of ma ybe a ppr oxi matel
y a hundred Yugoslave  J ews 
accomp...came acr oss t h e border at
 , and the Al banians 
let t
hem in. Uh her e
 the It alians are 
still the rulers of Albania, toge
ther with the Albanian
s, and these! Jews 
are escaping uh and 
Bel gra de. Uh t he Ger ma ns ha d bomb arde d Bel gra
de for twent y-four so
li d hours, at  the end 
of which they marched 
into the city, and some
 of these Jews were 
able to escape really 
literally escape by the 
back door when the Ge

the fr ont door, and uh 
ma de  thei r way t o t he  uh Albani an bor der an
d came acr oss. And uh ther e were t here wer e 
about a hundred of them. Eventu
ally we met them. We  are no
w i n 1942, a nd 
even anot her 
interesting uh point that
 I didn't uh mention 
I'll briefl y mention it, 
in this little uh house 
where  we li ved on the fa r m, a n 
Italian fa mily eventu

left t he l aundry, quote , unquote
 -  di d s o methi ng el s e with, for  
a living, for a 
l ivelihood. And 
an Italian fa mily moved 
in. He wa s a truck driv

. And uh s he  would be

the t he  far me r  who wa s li ving i n
 the back of the house, didn't he
ar us and uh we  lived on the 
ground fl oor  of c our se , a n d it  was  a Fri day ni

was being opened from the 
outside. And our littl
e dog, Picholo, ju
mped through the 
window, and he was the saving 
grace. Italians are very frigh

wo uld be bitten by a

to their uh health
 aut horiti es and 
where  di d you get t he  bit e . We ll,
 they let the window
 fall down, and ra n a w a y, and we  di dn't 
hear  from the m, but  a gai n, this  was  t h e most 
fri ght ening experi ence  a nd uh the dog bar k ed 
half the night. Never came back
 until the next mornin

our life! There's no 
two wa ys  about  it. Thes e two s oldi ers , and t he y 
we re fr om t he , the ones wit h t he feat her ed

 to get  s o me  mone y 
obviously. But you never know what
 e lse t hey c a me out uh they
 were out for,
 and uh we  
reported them the next 
morni ng. That whole  ni ght  we  sta y

very bad experience. And uh the

 to identify, even if they had 
the slightest doubt th

you know involve th
emselves into such
 a trap, and they 
didn't. We  never were uh bothered
 again, but i t  ne ver ne ver wa s 
a safe place again fo r us. Uh 
we lived as I  sai d abou
t a mile and a half or 
two mi les away from the

out at night. We  had to uh deliv
er t he  laundry, or  t hings of th

he ma de  a  hole i n our , be twe en our a p art ment

wo uld happen again, we 
wo uld have an escape route. We  ha

Our re al proble ms  star te d. This  
is summer of 1943 
and uh we  heard about it, and uh once 
be for e my parent s had a  very uh
 close call . They wal ked on 
the beach, and 
the one a nd onl y 
really bad uh Al banian police officer whom 
we met throughout a

recogniz ed t he m, st oppe d his car , a n d a ske d his  uh

t he m bac k i n either  or  , a n

d uh t he onl y t h ing my par e nts 
were able to do was to inform
 t his  engi neer  , whom until
 now we  ha d onl y known on a  
social  basis , that his  wi fe  invite d us  to Chr i st

to us and brought us food when we lived out
 in the village, and uh 
they immediate...I had

she came and she took me  to he

lived, t he y li ved year-r ound, a nd uh he, it  took
 hi m about  four  or  five
 days to uh get  my 
pare nts  out of jail . The y wer e i n s olit ary conf

mother and my father 
bot h didn't  s pea k a ny Al bani an. You can i magi n

here  i mpri soned with wome n who at  night put  ou

unbelieva ble  hor ror. Uh and a fte r

Ger ma ns , maybe onl y a  mont h be
for e the Ger ma ns occ upi ed 
Albania. As soon as the 
Germans occupied Albania,
 this engineer took 
my fa

small village. I, it was 
called . It fell in the northern
 part  of the c ountry, a  t iny 
vill age  where  he  was  doi ng some  
construction work, a nd he  pa sse d my
 father  off as an assist ant  
to hi m. He  lodged hi m wit h 
some peasant: or so
mething, I I'm not quite 
sure, but my poor father
 spoke very little Italian 
and not a word of Al bani
an, so for hi m thi s was 
s heer  tort ure . I mea n it  wa s rea lly ver y very 
terrible. And my  mother and I we
re taken in by the fa mily as their relatives, as her German 
relatives. This woman, with 
all  her Na zi background, ne ver  ne ver gave  us a wa y.  
 

My mother wa s a  di sta nt  relati ve
 who was living with

she was known in the

they would come. OK. It was 
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur

and we were  maybe  some ot her  vi site d ma ybe s o

Ha shanah uh my mother wa s sw

we  lived i n, it wa s t hat  uh 
was really a wood

in They shared this ho

and little kitchen. 
Eac h one  opening out  int o t he 
front porch a nd the  porc h ha d a  
few steps into the sand and 
that's that's the ex

that was i t
. So uh it wa s ma ybe s eve n, ei ght

 I'm not sure, and my 
mother was sweeping the front 
steps when out of no wher e a 
Ger ma n  o f fi cer wit h  a  fe w

looking for you 
for several days already and I 
never fi nd you at home

 was upstairs. He was 
luckily still in the ro

- she l ocked the door from the

And uh he pr ocee de d t o te ll

really didn't dare move 
a little. Uh he told us 
that his soldi ers wer e combing t he beach for

two German spies. She 
marched them into the

took uh uh an Albanian out. 
He wa s s hot  right out side  thi s

 God was good 
to them once again, and uh 
one of the uh offi cers inside th

station, rec o gniz ed my parent s fr

who knows  what woul d happe n

it open for eighteen days
, and t hen one  da y we  
saw one single solitary 
British airplane that bombed the escap

the end of it all when 
it was really over, some
 of the Germans soldie

deser t ed, we re in hi di ng -  we 
saw them later on wa
lking around in thei

They also blew up home s 
and this is one sight that
 will never leave my image 
- I have actually seen 
whole  house s go up, homes whic

s  were  either hidi ng in or  
belonged to fa mil ies  of Pa rtis
