Abstract 
 

Joseph Kirzhner was born in Odessa on January 
7, 1916. He had four brothers. One died before 
World Wa r II, one served in the Russian Army a s
 Joseph did, and the youngest brother was sent 
to safety in the Ural Mountains. Three brothe
rs survived, but their father, a hat ma ker, was 
killed fighting in the war. His mother was exterminated.  

 

Joseph drove tanks in the Russian Army for about
 five years before he became a prisoner of 
war in 1942, and was sent to a concentrati
on camp. Joseph was sent to three or four 
concentration camps, partly because he tried 
to escape four or five times Œ twice from 
Auschwitz. After being caught, Kapos used sticks to
 beat his bare feet, and then ma de him walk 
until hi s feet bled. In Auschwitz, one or two 
surgical experime nts were done on him. He 
reme mbers little except constant beatings, wire
 all around, and German sol diers tryi ng to shoot 
all the inmates as the liberating Russian Army approached.  

 

He was liberated in April 1945. One of his feet 
was frozen, and he had stomach problems. After 
treatment in a hospital, he returned to serve 
in the Russian Army. Later, he  worked as a 
shoema ker. He and his wife e migrated from 
Rus s ia to the United States in 1978. Joseph has 
suffered health problems , especially rega
rding his foot, ever since the war.   
 
The interview was conducted through an unident
ified interpreter, Ki
rzhner™s step-grandson, 
with assistance from Kirzhner™s wife. 
  
Transcript 
 

Interpreter
: What exactly do you want to know? 

 

Interviewer
: Just start off with his name , as best as 
we can determine his date of birth and also 
the place he was born and then ask him a little
 bit about his childhood, brothers and si sters, 
father and mother, you know that kind of thing, wh
at they were like, what his father did for a 

living, what his mother did. 

 

Interpreter
: He was born in 1916, January 7, 1916. That 
I can verify. He was born in the city 

of Odessa, that's  south Ukraine. His mother 
was a housewife and his father was a hat ma ker. 
Those days in 30's, 40's, hats, everybody used to
 wear them. There were
 three brothers, just 
three brothers. One died; his younge
r brother died before the war.
 His second brother is still 
alive. He lives in Russia in th
e city of Krasnodar, that's by th
e Ural Mountains. So there were 
four brothers originally, I'm sorry. 

 

Interviewer
: No problem. 

 
Interpreter
: One now still lives in Odessa. 

 

Interviewer
: Wa s he the oldest? 
 

Interpreter
: No, he's  the second oldest. His brother 
was born in 1914, his older brother. He is 
still alive. 

 

Interviewer
: I know that this will probably be hard, but does he reme mber anything about 
Odessa growing up? 

 

Interpreter
: Before the Second World Wa r, the life 
was a lot better than when they were 
leaving. His older brother went into the Army a c
ouple of years prior to him, his oldest brother. 
He was an aviator. 

 

Interviewer
: His brother was? 
 

Interpreter
: His older brother, yes. I have to clar
ify some thing, because he  mi xed me  up with 
the dates so I have to look up some  r ecords. 

 

Interviewer
: Sure, no problem. 
 

Interpreter
: He went into the Army altogether in 1940'
s, he was liberated from a concentration 
camp. Altogether, he was about nine
 and a half years in the Russi
an Army ; that includes near 
three and a half or four y
ears in concentration camp.  
 
Interviewer
: So he was a prisoner of war. I didn't know that. It didn't say that in his records. It 
is one of the groups in fact that we are trying–. 
 

Interpreter
: I think he was in Auschwitz. He doesn
't  reme mber. In 1942, April of 1942, April 
or June, I can't  ma ke it out, it is very old; in
 January of 1942 on the city of Rostov (Rostov-na-
Donu), in a small town called Panevtsy, and this
 is where he was actually taken prisoner. In 
April of 1945 he was liberated.  

 

Interviewer
: So he was in a concentration camp for three years? 
 

Interpreter
: Three years. Now during these three y
ears, I remember, because I was filling 
certain papers. In those days, about ten years 
ago, I was filling the 
papers for UJ, you know 
repatriation fund whatever they call that, I reme mb
er that he ran away four times. He was in 
two or three different camps be
sides Auschwitz, he was in -- I'
ll find out which. This is by the 
way, a copy of, when they liberated him, th
e Russian Army was giving a like a record. 
 

Interviewer
: So he was liberated by the Russian Ar my? 
 

Interpreter
: Right. And it says here he was liberat
ed by, it was signed by Lt. Kronov (see 
references below, which say signed by others) in
 April of 1945, Silesia, 
Upper Silesia. Where 
was? 
 

Interviewer
: It's in Poland (mostly in SW Poland, with some portions in Germany a nd some  in 
Czech Republic, according to 
Where Once We Walked
). 
 

Interpreter
: Auschwitz was there? 

 

Interviewer
: Close. Auschwitz was in that area. 
 

Interpreter
: Ahlborn was another camp 
and Katowice in Germany. 

 

Interviewer
: I think that 's in Poland. 
 

Interpreter
: In Poland also. Because I can't  ma ke it 
out. It is a very, very old copy, a dark 
copy; you know what's t he problem. And the ha
ndwriting, it's not print or anything. You know 

what repatriation is, right?  This
 is his copy of his ﬁNKGBﬂ or ﬁ
NKBﬂ?  that he is back citizen 
and that they checked him out and that he was 
in German concentration camp and they gave 
him the letter of repatriation and everything. OK? 

 

Interviewer
: Wa s he?  I know that many of those who 
returned after the wa r to Russia, the 
NKB were not very nice to them. 

 

Interpreter
: This is the original one. OK, in the back. 
OK. It says here that he was in the Army 

in the 9th Polk, you know what's Pol k, right, it'
s like a battalion, in J
une 1942, between June 
and July 1942, he was taken a prisoner and its 
station Tatsnitzki and 
Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu), 
probably T-a-t-n-i-t-s-k-i, 
T-a-t-z- n-i-t-s- k-i, T-a-t-s or T- a-t-z, something like that and like they 
used to say Gubernia province near Rost
ov (Rostov-na-Donu), OK?  And in 1942, he was 
stationed right there, there was a camp just fo
r war prisoners. Later 
on, in 1942, they took him 
to Katowice, Upper Silesia, in Germany, you know where it is, right? 

 

Interviewer
: Yes. 
 

Interpreter
: From over there, he ran away and he wa
s later and captured and taken to Ahlborn. 
 

Interviewer
: Is that al so in Germa
ny or is it in Poland? 
 

Interpreter
: Also Poland. And then, he ran away fr
om Ahlborn and they took him to Upper 
Silesia and that was, I think, I don't know the name  of the town -- Nikloch, Upper Silesia -- 

Niklai , looks like Niklai, it says here Upper S
ilesia and it says here, Germany, but I don't think 
Upper Silesia was Germany. 

 

Interviewer
: Yes, what the Germans did was they inco
rporated most of Poland into the Reich, 
so it became German territory. 

 

Interpreter
: Now do you want, it says here he wa s liber
ated by first, Russia
n front, yes here it 
says the name  of the city, Nikolai (Mikolow
, Poland or Mykolayiv, Ukraine or Niklovichi, 
Ukraine), Upper Silesia and the ma n who gave hi
m the letter of liberation is Captain Ivanov and 
they had to check him out because it is da
ted May 12th, 1945, so actually straight from the 
concentration camp they took him back to th
e Army. Oh, I 'm sorry, I was wrong. Right after 
they liberated him, they put him into the hospital, they had to operate. 
 

Interviewer
: He was injured and wounded? 
 

Interpreter
: Right, he has the wound. He was all 
cut up, because of his stomach and 
everything. When after the warand people liberated, they were
 drinking and eating and they 
weren't eating for years so right away a lot of th
em -- so he was in a hospital and they had to do 
surgery on him and everything and he came out of 
the hospital, he doesn't  know why he had the 
operation or anything. According to 
the records here, indicate thisis the original letter given 
Kirzhner, Joseph, born in 1916 in the city of Ode
ssa and he was liberated, and it is signed here 

Captain Ivanov and it is date
d April, 1945, NKO, Departme ntof Repatriation. And he was 
liberated by the 1st Ukranian Front. And Colone
l Karnavolov was the guy who signed it and it 
was a special Krokov, some  kind of Karnavolov punt, th
is is where they used
 to collect all the 
war prisoners, look in the records,
 check if they were
 traitors or not, an
ything like this. And it 
was stampe d by his stamp and it says he was the h
ead of repatriation for 1st Front of Ukraine. 
He's a Colonel Major Karnavolov. OK?  Altogether, 
I reme mber that he ran away four to five 
times from t he concentration camps and he was caught because they couldn't run far enough. So 

they were punished and one time, in Auschwitz 
they did some kind of experime nts. I think a 
couple of the wounds, because he wa sn't  operated 
only after the war. During the war they also 
did some  kind of experime nts because ther
e were a couple of operations done on him. 
 
Interviewer
: Does he reme mber that? 
 
Interpreter
: He doesn't . I asked him before why did 
they operate and he doesn't  reme mber 

anything, all right? His father got killed 
in the beginning of the Wa r in Odessa.  
 

Interviewer
: Was he fi ghting in the War? 
 

Interpreter
: Yes, he died in the front. And Mama, she was like the Jews, they were all 

exterminated, she was exterminated. His older brot
her was at the front fighting, the same  as he. 
And his parents sent his younger brot
her who lives in Krasnodar; th
ey sent him to relatives in 
another town. 

 

Interviewer
: So away. 
 

Interpreter
: Away from the front. He is the youngest br
other. He is still 
alive. He lives in 
Krasnodar. What else would you like to know? 

 

Interviewer
: Let's see. Can we back up a little bit a
nd ask hi m a little bit about hi s time in the 
Ar my?  Like before the wa r and 
also about the Finnish Wa r. 
 

Interpreter
: He reme mb ers that he wa s in Finland and that he was in active Army, be cause 
they were fighting but that's  all he reme mbers. 

 

Interviewer
: In the Army, what did he do?
 Wa s he an artillery ma n? 
 

Interpreter
: He was a driver, a truck driver. 

 

Interviewer
: So he drove a transport? 
 

Interpreter
: But in a tank division, he probably was 
in what do they call it, the mobile tank 
division? Oh, he was a driver of tanks?  He drove a tank, OK.  

 

Interviewer
: Does he reme mber where he ma
y have gotten near, what cities? 
 

Interpreter
: According to the records he was captu
red on the Rostov (Ros
tov-na-Donu). If you 
reme mber, on Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu), in 1942,
 it was the biggest tank, uh, that's  what 
happened. 

 

Interviewer
: No, I mean in Finland? 
 

Interpreter
: Oh, Finland. In Finland, he wasn't  a tank driver yet. 

 

Interviewer
: Oh, OK.  
 

Interpreter
: He already was a tank driv
er in Finland. And he was 
taken in prison, they were 
surrounded, the army was surrounded under the city
 of Nikolaiev (Mykolayiv) near Rostov 
(Rostov-na-Donu), you know. He was fighting in 
the city of Nikolai (Mikolow, Poland or 
Mykolayiv, Ukraine or Niklovichi, Ukraine) 
on South River or South Book (neither found). 
 

Interviewer
: Oh, the Book River, yeah.  
 

Interpreter
: It is about 500 km some
where near the city of Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu). This 
where actually he was taken prisoner. He doe
sn't  reme mber, there was something Millinov, 
Milli, he reme mbers some  na me s of the people th
at were in prison with him. The he ad of the 
5th part of division some thing, Maltzev; anot
her tank driver Yapalov, another tank driver 
Furdarov. During the war he told them that his name, he didn't tell them his real name because 

he was Jewish and the Jews were automa tically
 killed so he went under the name  of Urlov 
Sasha, which is Alexande r because he  has the 
eye because if you look at his eye --. He told 
them he was  a Tartar. Faust or Raust (Rauscha?) 
was the name of the concentration camp in the 
city of Nikolai (Mikolow, Pola
nd or Mykolayiv, Ukraine or Nikl
ovichi, Ukraine). Faust. And 
another camp by the name  of Seli ma
 (Sellin?), or this is Selima  
Faust, I have no idea. No, I'm 
sorry. Selima was his friend. They were together
 in a concentration camp. You reme mber he 
was in Auschwitz. According to that letter, Ni
kolai was the last camp they (can™t understand). 
Nikolov?  (Nikolaistr. ? )  I think 
it™s Nikolai (Nikolaist r. ?). 
 

Interviewer
: I'll look it up when I get back. 

 
Interpreter
: According to that letter, 
it's Nikolai (Nikolaistr.?). 
 

Interviewer
: Does he reme mber anything about the camps
, being in them, what they were like? 
 

Interpreter
: He says all he reme mbe r s is wire a
ll around, and my  grandmot
her says sometimes 
when they show movies then he remembers, he
 says this tower here , this tower ther e. He 
shouldn't really get into -- too much for him 
in one day. He reme mbers constant beatings. I 
think that should be enough. 

 

Interviewer
: Let me get a little bit about the end st ra
ight. You said he was in these different 
concentration camps from '42 
to '45. And he was liberated by the Russian Ar my, the 1
st
 
Ukrainian Fr ont in April of 1945. No w he was interviewed by the NKGB.  

 

Interpreter
: The NKO i s  a different, I wouldn't know; let's try to figure it out. NKO, this is 

exactly what it says. After the war,
 a lot of prisoners, they said 
"well, if you'r e alive, then you 
are a traitor". So NKO is proba
bly a special committee who used to check and I think I gave 
you the name of the Colonel who signed it. OK? 

 

Interviewer
: You did. I know that most of the prisone
rs were considered traitors. But he 
wasn't?  

 

Interpreter
: He wasn™t. First of all, he had his 
two feet frozen, his 
legs were frozen. 
 

Interviewer
: And that's because he was in the camps; in the colder air. 
 
Interpreter
: Exactly. That I know from his me dical 
history because I go some ti me s to the 
doctor and when they ask him certain things
 from the years before I reme mber. And I 
reme mber he used to tell me  when I was a kid 
that a couple of times he ran away a few guys 
together with, the name  of his friend I gave you, 
a couple of time s he ran away from a couple of 
camps. 
 

Interviewer
: When he told you these stories, did he give you any more details? 
 

Interpreter
: We ll, when they used to catch them, they
 used to give them heavy beatings and 
they used to beat them on thei
r feet. The guys who used to beat
 them we re different prisoners. 
 

Interviewer
: They were Germans?  
 

Interpreter
: Not only Germans, not only Germa ns. 

 

Interviewer
: Do you reme mber who they were? We
re they other prisoners or were– 
 

Interpreter
: Yes, he told me  they were Kapos. They 
used to beat them with a stick on their 
bare feet and ma ke them walk, you know, until the blood used to come  out. 

 

Interviewer
: Did he give you any more details on this 
kind of thing, was this in Auschwitz or 
was it somewhere else? 
 

Interpreter
: I can't  ma ke  it out. He's trying to te
ll me  some thi ng. I think Ge rmans threw 

some thing. He has a problem with his kidney so some ti me s it become s unclear for a while. 

When the liberation army started mo ving in closer and they started bombing the camps, so the 

German sol diers lined everybody up and they started 
to shoot them all, or to shoot them before 
the Army got there, before the liberation came. 
All the prisoners started to run in different 
directions. This was just before liberation. 
And right away, right after, the bombing and 
shooting and disarray, within an hour or tw
o the Russian army moved in and they were 
liberated. When he was liberated, he had a problem
 with his stomach and his feet were frozen. 
 

Interviewer
: Was the problem with his stomach because he di dn't have anything to eat, was 
that what it was and he ate too much? 

 

Interpreter
: He doesn't  reme mber why but it was a
ll the way up to here. You know ma ybe it 
was experime nt or some thing. He doesn't  reme mber. I can't ma ke it out. He was operated once 

in Germany and after the war the second time. 
I know that his feet, you know why because his 
original trade after the war became a shoemaker and when I was a child I used to sit next to him 

and he used to fix the shoes in th
e house, we used to talk and I 
used to ask him questions and he 
used to tell me and I asked him how come you lik
e your shoes white and he said because I like 
it white and with warm lining becau
se  during the war, he said my 
foot was frozen and if I get a 
little flu or some thing, my foot swells up and redconstantly and then he got some  kind of rash, 

which goes on, you know. 

 

Interviewer
: We ll, the only thing I can do if you reme mber more of what he told you, 
because–. 

 

Interviewer
: Basically, this is. 
 

Interviewer
: This is all he told you? 
 

Interpreter
: Yes. I reme mber a pictur e of his father
, my grandfather, because he was a very 
big, bold ma n and we used to have a Communist
 hero called Kotovsky, his last name , I don't 
know if you ever follow Russian history. When I 
was a little baby, I reme mber I used to tell 
everybody my grandfather was Kotovsky because he
 was big and bold ma n and he had always 
uniform of Russian Army and I reme mber him on 
the pictur es and what else. I di d meet my 
grandfather's two brothers and we live here 
17 years already so you can
 understand. I reme mber 
the stories of hi m running away from the camp a
nd in one camp he told them he was from 
Moldavia and another camp he told them he's
 Tartar because  most of the Tartars were 
considered like people the Communists and Russ
ians used to terminate them themselves so 
Germans tried to leave Tartars alone. They used
 to give them a heavy beating and take them 
into the camp. 

 

Interviewer
: So he told this to the Germans, that he's Moldavian and Tartar. 
 

Interpreter
: Right, exactly. Once he told them Moldavia
n and that didn't work, so the next he 
got captured when he ran away with the othe
r guy, you have the name , I don't re me mber, they 
told both that they were Tartar
, and he advised him to say the same  and he'd teach him a couple 
of words here and there and that's  it. That's  how 
it went. All together, I th
ink they ran away four 
times. I remember from previous records that 
I filled for his pension and everything. Each time 
they were caught, they we re taken to a camp. I 
think from Aus c hwitz alone, they tried to run 
twice. 

 

Interviewer
: And they were caught both times? 
 

Interpreter
: Yes, and they were beat on their feet 
by the Kapos. That I reme mber pretty well. 
And then when they wanted to do some thing, they were barefoot. 

 

Interviewer
: After the War, after the ope
ration, what did he do, did he
 stay in Russia for a long 
time? 

 

Interpreter
: Oh, he came back to the city of Odessa. That's  when he me t my grandmother. 

Because this is my step-grandfather. My real gr
andfather died during the war also. He died in 

the Russian Ar my in 1942. 1944, my real grandfat
her died. They me t after the war. But he 
always had his health problem after the war. As
 I reme mber, in 1950's, he was in the hospital, 
1960's. 

 

Interviewer
: When did you all come  to the United States? 
 

Interpreter
: We  ca me  1976, they came  1978. 
 
Interviewer
: You came before that. 
 
Interpreter
: In 1976. 

 

Interviewer
: OK, I think that's all the questions I have. 
 

Interpreter
: All right.
