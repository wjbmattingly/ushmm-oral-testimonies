Interview with Carla Lessing 
June 28, 1999 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: This is United States Holocau
st Memorial Museum, 
Jeff and Toby Herr 
collection, and this is an interview with 
Carla Lessing, conducted by Jo e Richmond, on 
June 28
th
, 1999, in the Lessing home. And this is 
a follow up interview to the Memorial 
Museum videotaped intervie
w, conducted with Carla Le
ssing, in 1990. And the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum grateful
 -- gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby 
Herr for making this interview po
ssible. This is tape number one, side A. Let™s start just 
with sort of a brief overview of your experi
ences during the war, before we move on to -- 
to after the war. 
Answer: Yeah. I was born, and went to school
 in Holland, in The 
Hague, and in August 
of 1942, my  mo ther and my  brother and I went 
into hiding. My  father had already died, in 
1936. We had gotten a place to hide through th
e Jesuit, of the Catholic church, who were 
working in the Resistance, and they found 
a place to hide in The Hague, with a widow 
who took in Jews in order to -- not necessary 
help Jews, but to help
 her to go to heaven . 
That particular hidi
ng place did not work out, because
 the -- the lady was so in -- 
exceedingly anxious that her sons
, who knew about that we were 
hiding there, told us that 
we needed to leave. Th
ey did tell us that we were foun
d out, but that was not really the 
truth. So then we went from 
The Hague, again to the Catho
lic church, we found another -
- not we found, but th-the Underground foun
d another place in Delft with a Catholic

family with seven children in
 a very small, little whole 
downstairs, where it was the 
barber shop and the beauty pa
rlor, and we were upstairs, a
nd we stayed there. We were 
supposed to be staying there temporarily because it was not a proper -- not proper -- it™s 
not a good place to have three more people in
 the house, and especially three Jews, 

because there were seven children, it was ve
ry dangerous for the 
whole family. We did 
stay there until the end of the 
war, because my mother always 
told them that she did not 
want to be separated from her children. So 
we stayed there until the war was over in 
1945, May fifth, 1945. We -- 

Q: Wh-W ho was it -- Who made up your fam
ily? How many -- it was your mother, and -- 
A: My mother, my older brother, and my
self. My father had already died. My 
grandparents, who had immigrated from Germ
any, and my  uncle, who had immigrated 
from Germany in the 30™s, were hiding in th
e eastern part of Holland, but we did not 
know where they were hiding. There was a 
little bit of contact 
between them and us, 
through a third party, who su
pplied us with ident -- false 
identity cards. So -- But we 
really didn™t know where they wer -- we di
dn™t know where anybo
dy was, really. We 
didn™t know that my uncle and aunt, and th
eir little daughter had gone to Westerbork, and 
then were transported to Au schwitz. My un
cle went to Sobibór, we didn™t know wh ere 
anybody was. I mean, we
 only found that out later. So
 that was really my immediate 
family, my mother, my brothe
r, and I, and my mother didn™t want to be separated from 
her children. My brother, at the beginning of
 the war in 1940, was 14, and I was 11. So, 
anything else that you woul
d like to know about this?

Q: Well, during that time, how much inform
ation could you get wh
en you were -- when 
you were in hiding? I mean, di
d you have any sense of what 
was going on either in the 
world, or how dangerous it was for you at that time? 
A: I found out later that -- I wasn ™t aware, 
I was kind of numb during th e war. I found out 
later that my brother would go in one -- in
 the only to ilet of the -- of the house, and 
apparently the neighbors had a new radio, an
d they were listening to -- illegally to -- it 
was called ra -- Radio Oranga, Radio Oran
ge [indecipherable] was -- it came fro m 
England, and he knew -- he -- 
he would listen very  carefully 
wh at they had to  say, what 
was going on. He did hear a 
little bit what™s going on. We 
knew that the invasion of 
Normandy, for instance, we were
 very happy, because we t
hought we would be liberated 
quickly. And we knew that they
 -- all they had -- all -- came all the way to Ireland, I 
mean Holland, and -- I mean, we
 -- we heard some stuff, but 
we didn™t know really the -- 
the -- the -- the -- the scale of 
the -- of the war, and the destruction of the Jews. We would 
hear planes coming over, going -- the German 
planes going to  England, and th e English 
planes going to Germany to  bomb [indecipherab
le]. We -- I was really
 pretty numb, that™s 
really what it was, so I was -- I just was ki
nd of waiting fo r it to be over, and took a long, 
long, long time. You have nothing to do, [inde
cipherable] happen. No thing to  do, so days 
were very long, and nothi
ng happened, you know. 
Q: Was that one of the hardest, the boredom? 
A: No, th-the -- the hardest thing was rea
lly the fear. Boredom was -- somehow you -- 
you know, as a g -- as a girl 
I would -- could -- if there wa
s some food, we could peel 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050

potatoes, I could knit, I could read . We were k
eenly aware that we we
re very much in the 
way, that we endangered the people we were
 hiding with, that there was not enough food. 
That we had -- somehow th ere was a terribly 
-- disturbance in the family, that my  hiding 
mo ther was extremely anxious, that my  hiding
 father was the one who wanted  this, who 
did this, with all his heart. So we -- we -- we 
kind of picked up co nsta
ntly these -- these -- 
these cues, I would say, from everyone. The 
children were angry, the little ones were -- 
the young ones in -- in
 that family were not -- you know
, they -- they c
ouldn™t play the 
way they  would play  before, or talk, because th
ey had to keep this a secret that we were 
there. A family would visit, we had to quickl
y go upstairs to the bedrooms, and then be 
very quiet. So it was a very tense situati
on. I -- Boredom was -- I would almost say 
secondary  [indecipherable] you know, it was -- it wa
s really the fear th
at any of us would 
do th e wrong th ing, and th en it 
would leak out that we were 
hiding there, and then we 
would be sh -- sent to the camp s, and al -- an
d of course, my  hiding father would be also 
picked up and sent to the co
ncentration camps. We didn™t quite
 know that, but we knew it 
was extremely dangerous. 
Q: You often mentioned in the vi
deotaped interview about Walter? 
A: Walter? 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Walter, Walter Verhane -- see, in Holland, 
that -- the -- the young man, who between 
16, and whatever, older, 26 or so
, were sent to the camps -- not
 the camps, to the -- they 
had to go wo rk camps, yes, work  camps. A
nd he was -- he was the one who was called up 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
6
 
 
 
 
to go to one of those work cam
ps in -- in -- in Germany. He 
decided to go and not to go 
into hiding. And luck ily he came back. That 
was one of the mo st horrendous things for 
us, because we knew -- we always suspected he
 had gone there because we were in the 
house, and that he really coul
dn™t go in to hiding, because, we
ll, we needed to find another 
place, they would be looking fo
r him. And after the war, we -- we always heard that he 
suffered terribly. It was very difficult to thin
k about, always, that he went th ere because 
of us, and I never realized how long he wa
s there, he was there from 1943 to ™45. I 
thought he was there maybe 
for a half year. So many, many years are -- many, many 
decades after the war, I wrote him a letter, a
nd asked him exactly wh
y he had decided to 
go to  a work  camp, and then he wrote back 
that he -- it was adventurous -- an adventure 
for him. I don™t know if he was comp letely tr
uthful. He was a very religious man and he 
believed that he -- that he would be saved, th
at he would not get hur
t or killed. He had a 
terrible time there. He was -- He was imprisone
d there, I found out later. I -- I mean, I -- I 
-- I probably heard th is all in 1945, but some
how I pushed it away, 
and he -- I found out 
later that he had been in  a work  camp , and 
then he said something that -- against the 
German nation, and somebody revealed that 
to -- I don't know to  whom, and he was 
eventually  taken to prison in  Germany. 
Q: Did you -- So, did you continue a co
rrespondence with hi
m [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, well, I go regularly to Holland, I mean
, regularly every three years, four years, 
five years, and we always m
eet up. And he has done -- which 
is very interesting, he has 
made contact with other people who were in th
ere, in [indecipherable] were in the same 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
7
 
 
 
 
prison, in  the same workcamp , and they have
 a reunion, so they have done quite, you 
know, similar thing what we ha
ve done, kind of come out, a
nd talked to others who were 
in the same  situation, and he even  wrote 
about it, and I have his -- his story. So -- 
Q: What was the name  of his story? 
A: I don™t know. I re -- can™t remember. I 
[indecipherable] can™t 
remember. I don™t know 
if he gave it a name yet, or -- but, 
you know, it™s just a personal memo ir. 
Q: So what was the relationship like between 
your family and your hiding family? It was 
[inaudible]  

A: During the time, it was very -- it -- very 
tense at times. After the war, we would -- we 
still -- we always go there, although my -- my
 hiding parents are dead
 now, but I -- when 
I™m in Holland, I always visit with them. My br
other always sends them
 -- he™s in Israel -
- he sends, around Christma s [indecipherable] he
 sends oranges, or -- or grapefruits from 
Israel. We call at Christmas, and we call at
 birthday, to th e er -- just the oldest d-
daughter, not all -- not all seven of them, but 
one or two are -- have -- one -- one of the 
sons is very angry with us, because they thou
g h t th at my mo th er wa
s very rich, that she 
had a lot of money, and that she didn™t give 
enough money for our hiding to her parents. 
My mother was very poor, sh
e was a widow. The -- The other 
childs, that™s the one, two, 
three, fourth  oldest, and there is another 
one who also doesn™t feel so comfortable 
because they  think that, you know, he -- we 
should have given more 
money. We didn™t -- 
My mother didn™t have money,
 and they were paid very little
 through the underground, or 
through my uncle, who was -- he was -- as a fact, 
he was in hiding in 
-- in -- in the east of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
8
 
 
 
 
Holland, and I think they sent like, only so me 
money, cause he owned a factory. With the 
others, it™s -- it™s -- it™s a pretty good relations
hip. We always have to be thankful for 
them because we -- now the children, you know, 
they -- they are aware 
that they suffered, 
too, wh ile we were in hiding th ere, and th
e interesting thing is this happened very 
recently, I got -- for our 50
th
 anniv -- wedding anniversary, 
we got a letter from the third 
oldest child, who is really -- I would almo
st say obsesse d with the war. He reads 
everything, he talks second 
World War, and -- all the time, 
and he now has written -- he 
wanted us to read this during 
our party, but we didn™t because we had to translate this, 
and it wasn™t quite appropriate. But in the -- in 
this particular letter that he -- was sent the 
10
th
 of May, which was kind of
 interesting, this -- the 
war started in Holland, 10
th
 of May 
of 1999, he sent this letter, and there was a pa
ragraph in there which said that the children 
of rescuers were not recogniz
ed, especially not in Ho lland. And it just so happened that I 
know a psychologist in Holland
, who had just written a book 
about the -- the selection, 
and dislocation of th e children of
 rescuers. S o , what I did, I put them in contact with each 
other, so that this man, who is in his 70™s no
w, not well, can talk to this woman who just 
wrote the book. She is -- Her name is Luma 
Abbas-Amden, she™s a psychologist, she has 
written quite a few books about rescuers. She 
was in hiding herself, 
was found, and went 
to a concentration camp, so she has -- she is very, very, very familia
r with -- with subject, 
has done quite a bit of resear -- research. So
, I hope it will help this particular man, 
Donald Prafana is his name. Maybe if he sp
eaks to this Luma Ab bas-Amden, maybe he

gets a little bit of validation, and a little bit 
of relief. So that™s 
kind of right now my 
relationship with -- actually the -- only now w
ith the children of my
 rescue family.  
Q: Let™s -- I guess let™s -- let™s go on to af
ter the -- after the war, after liberation. 
A: After liberation, that was very strange. 
We -- We had to leave there, but we had no 
place to go, we were in hiding in Delft, a
nd we were -- returned 
from The Hague. So my 
mother found a place for me to 
stay with a -- actually, it was 
the hiding family of a great 
aunt of mine, who was an ice skater, I can™
t remember for how long, until she found an 
apartment, you know, she was gi
ven an apartment in -- in -- in
 The Hague. I -- I can™t tell 
you how long, or -- how 
long I was there. The -- The only 
thing I remember th at, it was a 
very strange family, and that for the first 
time, I saw somebody who used opium. Th--Th-
The father in that -- in that household [ind
ecipherable] can™t tell you, it™s the only thing I 
remember. He was addicted. That was like in
 May, June, of 1945. My mother found it 
very necessary that I would go
 back to school, and my brot
her went -- they tried to find 
work for him. He didn™t want to go to 
school. He went and -- He went on hashava 
[indecipherable] from Israel. I do
n™t know exactly what the da
tes were when he went. So 
my mother and I lived 
in the apartment, which was -- sh
e had gotten apartment in a very 
bad neighborhood of The Hague,
 and even tually we moved 
to a better neighborhood. I 
did go to school. I went -- My mother felt that
 it was necessary that I would go to school 
with girls my  age, 16 or 17 years old. So  I 
went -- She got me -- and this is remarkable -- 
she got me into a school fo
r home economics, which was ki
nd of an -- kind of after high 
school you went there, and at 
night I went to evening high 
school. And th en we found the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
10
 
 
 
 
Zionist organization, and th at™s what we did 
in our free time, and that™s where we found 
back -- actually we didn™t find back, we found 
other people that were in hiding that came 
back -- back from -- from the 
concentration camps. I didn™t 
find back my friends, my old 
friends from before the war, excep
t one. So that was really my
 life after -- after the war. 
My mother tried to make a liv
ing, didn™t succeed very well.
 She didn™t have specific 
skills, she was -- I think sh e was selling some
 perfume, and stuff to stores, and then 
eventually she found a job as a manager 
in a clothing -- in clothing stores.  
Q: Was everyone at that time trying to -- just
 go back to  normal life? I mean, did -- did -- 
did it -- you know, like it could po
ssibly be like [indecipherable] 
A: We tried desperately to go
 back to normal life, but it 
was very difficult, because all 
around us, everything was diffe
rent. You know, you always 
be -- you -- you know, just 
me going to school for home economics with
 girls who had gone [indecipherable] to 
school -- to high school. I didn™t fit in, you 
know? In th e evening school, the evening high 
school, I didn™t fit in either. So, it was kind of
 an -- we tried desperately to kind of live a 
normal life, but I think in Ho lland, we couldn™
t really do it. There were too many -- it -- it 
-- it was just so -- it was such a destruction 
of the Jews that w-we constantly were 
reminded of it, even if you don™t want just to
 really face it on, [indecipherable] see it, but 
we were constantly reminded of it. And my
 uncle, and my  aunt, and my  -- my  cousins 
were -- were killed in a concentration camp. 
So, I didn™t have fam
ily. My -- Luckily, my 
grandparents, and my  uncles also survived  
the war. They were just caught maybe two 
days befo re the liberation, and th ey didn™t 
know what to do with two old people. And my  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
11
 
 
 
 
uncle, they put him in prison, 
and then the Germans left, and 
so my -- then
 -- then they 
were freed. But it was just at the last mo ment
 that they were caught, and -- and like I said, 
the Germans didn™t quite know what to do with
 them because the war was almo st over. I-
It -- What I remember, the best part of our 
lives was then the Zion
ist organization where 
we all came together with those who surviv
ed, and had weekends of -- you know, like 
camp -- like studying, and we danc
ed, and we sang, and we ta
lked ev ery night. We all 
wanted to go to Israel. My 
brother was called up to  go to 
Indonesia, because that™s -- in 
1946, they were going to fight 
to keep Indonesia 
at that time, the Dutch East Indies 
independent. And th e Jewish -- ma ny of the Je
wish survivors, young men, didn™t go, and 
they went on illegal alleyah to -- to Israel. 
And my -- So my brother left -- I guess it was 
in 19 -- maybe 1946, or 
so -- earlier than that, to southe
rn France, and -- and then went, I 
don™t know, maybe stayed there. The whole tr
ip was like three months, and then  he went 
on one of those boats illegally to Israel, a
nd he was -- he was on the last boat that 
[indecipherable] was caught, but went all the wa
y to Israel, and went into an -- in a camp. 
He didn™t go -- The next boat went to Cypr
us [indecipherable]. So he has been, since 
1946 [indecipherable]. So -- So 
my mother and I were left. I 
met Ed in the -- in Zionist 
organization. He left in -- Yeah, go ah ead. 

Q: What was it about the Zionist organization th at -- what did that do fo r -- for you, and -

- and the other [indecipherable] 
A: We didn™t talk about it, wh-what it did fo
r us was we -- we knew that we had the same 
experience. We didn™t talk about it, but we kne
w, we -- it felt comfortable. It didn™t feel 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
12
 
 
 
 
comfortable with the non-Jewish youngsters
 because they  had -- didn™t have such a 
disruption in  their lives as we had had, and th
ey didn™t have so many losses in their lives 
as we had had. They said they
 suffered terribly in -- in -- in
 the war, but it -- they didn™t 
quite understand wh at happened  to  us, that 
wh en you -- when  we came out of the war, we 
couldn™t go home, because there was no 
home any more. Our -- To go back 
[indecipherable] that it seems that as soon as
 we went into  hiding, they emptied our 
apartment, and all the furniture
, ev erything was gone, in no
 time. You know, they just 
emptied it out. So , we didn™t have a place 
to go back to, so to
 be with them was 
wonderful, wonderful. And then  the other thing that was wonderful, we had the Israeli 
soldiers, who were in the Br
itish brigade, came also to 
Holland, and they represented 
healthy young men who 
had fought in the second Wo rl
d War, and were not persecuted, 
and so th ey were like symbols of health, 
and -- and -- and was wo nderful. An d many of 
our friends went with them back to Israel
. Some got married, they fell in love, got 
married, some married [indeci
pherable] you know, just to bring somebody into  Israel 
without being -- I forgot what [indecipherable]
 in -- in the -- someth
ing that they were 
allowed to go in to as well, so our friends al
so disappeared, you know, like my  brother, he 
went illegally to Israel, so even in those tim
es, people went -- left
 us. They kind of, you 
know they went to Israel, and 
-- and then I, like I said, I met Ed
. Ed left in June of 1947, 
and we didn™t quite know if we were going to  get married, or not, but we were going to 

kind of see if -- the sep aration, if it lasted
 through writing. I comp leted my  schools there, 
and I -- we got a visa for United States becau
se -- very quickly, because my mother was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
13
 
 
 
 
German born, and the quota for German born 
people was very low, compared to the 
Dutch, and I was underage, too,
 so I left for th e United Stat
es in January of ™49, which 
was quite something, because we really didn™t
 want to go to the United States, really 
wanted to go to Israel, but I want to get ma
rried to Ed, so I had to
 go first to United 
States, before I could go to Israel. 

Q: But you knew -- you -- you 
[indecipherable] United States, but you -- you didn™t think 
you [indecipherable] want to st
ay in Holland? Is that -- 
A: There was really very little
 in Holland for us. Looking 
back now, it -- it didn™t feel 
comfortable any more. There were very few Je
ws at that time. I don™t know what -- I 
don™t think we saw a future 
in Holland. Course you have to
 rememb er, the Zionists, so 
there was only a future in Israel. Y ou didn™t ev
en want to even cons
ider that there was a 
future in -- in -- in Holland. And we would ju
st go to  Un ited States to kind of go th ere, 
and then go to Israel, w h ich 
we did in ™51. The period in  
-- in -- in -- here in United 
States, between ™49 -- for me from ™49 until 
™51 was kind of strange. I don™t know. We 
got married six weeks after I came to the St
ates, it was the smallest wedding you can 
imagine, there were -- you know
, there were five people at 
this ceremony, with the justice 
of peace, and seven people at 
the lunch. Course 
we didn™t have -- ev erybody was poor, 
and we didn™t have family. Ed 
went back to work , he had a job th ere, I went with him to -
- it was in Ossening, New York. 

Q: What did you think when  you got to 
th e United States, [indecipherable] strange? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
14
 
 
 
 
A: Strange, well, because I never really want
ed to go, probably, and it was -- w as kind of 
another disruption, and we really didn™t want
 to stay, so it was like a vacation here, but 
not quite, because we had to live a daily 
life, and -- and again, I had a hard time 
connecting. I realize that now, I didn™t realize 
that then. I wasn™t lik
e the other American 
kids who were 19 years old and had gotten marri
ed, I di -- hadn™t gone to school here. I 
had a strong accent, I didn™t know the ways
 of you --   you know the ways of the 
Americans. So it -- it felt as if I didn™t be
long, which I -- I didn™t belong, really. I 
eventually went to work [inde
ciph erab le] to  mak e  so me  mo n e
y, go to Israel. That felt a 
little better because I -- I worked
, and my days were stru ctur
ed. I didn™t work there very 
long. I was a filing clerk, I knew foreign geog raphy, so I had a special assignment. Was -- 
I think at that time I always wanted to go 
to Israel, that™s [inde
cipherable]. Also , my 
friends had gone there, you 
know, fr-friends from Holland. We
 went in 1951 to Israel, 
because Ed was about to be called up for the 
Korean war, and so he 
left before he got 
enlisted for the Korean war. I -- W e arrived in 
late January of ™51 in Israel, we went to 
the kibbutz where my brother was, and I felt r
eally very good there.  I had my first child 
was born in December of ™51, it was for me 
a very good time [ind
ecipherable]. I was a 
worker, a mother, and a member of the ki
bbutz. I had voting rights, which was very 

unusual as a woman. I fitted in. There were 
other people from Holla
nd, which, you know, 
we had th e little group of Dutch people, not that
 we always spoke Dutch, I don™t think so, 
but we had the same background, so I was real
ly appreciated as a -- as a worker, I was -- 
work ed with babies, and with 
the toddlers, and I had my  ow
n group, and that was -- that

was a good time. Our child go
t sick, she had tuberculosis
 of the lymph nodes, here, 
lymph, and that was a horrible time, she was 
in the hospital for six months, and then sh e 
needed to be separated still from other peop
le. That was horrendou
s. Ed was not very 
happy in -- in the kibbutz, it wa
s very difficult for him to kind of
 fit in that -- in that kind 
of rigid structure.

Q: This is an continuation of the interview 
with Carla -- Carla Lessi
ng, and th is is tape 
one, side B. You were just talking 
about in the kibbutz that Ed was -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- less h appy. 

A: Ed was less happy. He had a hard time with 
-- like I said, rigid structure. Also, at that 
time, there was very -- what can I say, little
 chance for anybody to
 do any -- 
anything 
different than wh at you were assigned to do. 
To get, for instance, 
go to Haifa to take a 
painting course, I as -- I remember was somebody
 want to do that, th
at had to go through 
many, many people, it had to be okayed  by th
e general meeting. I mean, everything was -
- nowadays you could do it eas
ily, you could go and study, but in those days it was a -- 
more of the pioneer times. So we
 decided to -- Ed decided rea
lly, and I kind of agreed, to 
go back to the United States for 
a couple of years, because E-
Ed I think, might have been 
one of the very few people who had not one re
lative in Israel. I had, besides my  brother 
and my sister-in-law, I me -- they had one child
 at that time, I had an uncle, a maternal 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
16
 
 
 
 
uncle and aunt, and a cousin in Israel. So I ha
d a little bit of family in Israel, but he had 
none. So  that was a difficult period because we
 went back, and th at, of course, in those 
days, was very, very bad that
 you go back to  the Un ited States. You were kind of a 
deserter. And we couldn™t go 
back to the States, because my  daughter had had 
tuberculosis, we could go back 
to Holland. So we decided -- 
we couldn™t enter the United 
States because she had had tuberculosis, we 
decided to  go to  Ho lland. And we stayed for 
one year in Holland, she was 
then healthy en ough
 to go. The Americ
an embassy let us 
go, gave us a visa. The year 
in Holland, and that was in 1955 - ™56, was kind of a 
vacation for us. We went to Ho lland knowing th
at we™re not going to stay, we kind of 
enjoyed it. Ed went to work, I 
took care of our daughter. We had some old friends there, 
it was familiar, we spoke the language. And 
we knew it was only going to be a short 
period of time. So we arrived here in the Unit
ed States in October of ™56. Let™s see, Ed 
had an -- h-his grandfather lived in Amsterdam,
 so we had a little b it of family  in Holland 
when we were there. We arrived Octo
ber ™56, in the United States, again. 
Q: At that point, were you thinking th at
 maybe you would get back to Israel? 
A: Yeah, we were going to go 
back to Israel in -- after a fe
w years. I -- I -- I didn™t really 
want to go to the Un ited States. That never 
happened. He started -- Ed fo und a job here 
where -- in the neighborhood 
where we lived, in Dobb™s 
Ferry. My daughter went to 
school, went to kinderg arten 
and Dan was born in ™58. Ed 
went to evening school, to 
Pratt Institute. So, we kind of led this norma
l family life, where th
e husband g-goes to 
work , and he went to  school at night, and I to
ok care of the children, and -- and we tried 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
17
 
 
 
 
to live kind of an -- a normal lif
e, as Holocaust survivors. It
 was mo re normal than when 
we did not have children, because you know, 
you have to -- you have
 children, you have 
mo re contact with the other people, because th
e -- like my daughter went to kindergarten, 
and we met some other people whose childre
n went to kinderg arten, or she brought 
girlfriends home, and I met the parents, a
nd so that was mo re often a normal life, 
although it was a difficult life, cau se Ed was away
 a lot, going to school, and then that he 
had a lot of homework a
nd so on. And we didn™t have a 
lot of money, we had very little 
money. That time I see as -- it was kind of 
a good time, having th -the children, and 
having contact with other people. We then 
moved from Dobb™s Ferry, actually to here. 
That was in 1963, Ed had just graduated fro
m Pratt Institute, and my daughter went to 
junior high, and our son went 
to kinderg arten here. And we were not involved at all with 

survivors, except my  whole family. My mo th
er was a -- is a -- you know, was a survivor, 
she w-worked in New York  City
, my in-laws were survivors,
 they lived in
 Springfield, 
Massachusetts. My -- My two 
brothers-in-law were, you know, they -- they went to 
college. Like I said, my children were surro
unded by survivors, they grew up with 
survivors, that™s -- was their family. I went to
 college too, in 1967 , to community college, 
Westchester Community College, 
completed that, went to Mercy College, the Catholic 
College right near here, comple
ted my  Bachelor™s degree. Tr
ying to catch up, because I 
really wanted to do something, but I didn™t
 have the degrees. Before that, I was an 
assistant nursery school teacher. I work ed part
 time when Dan was five years old. So  I 

worked from, he was five, ™63 to I went to
 -- full time to Columbia
 School of So cial 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
18
 
 
 
 
Work in s -- I worked 
for 10 years, ™73 I went there.So I worked for 
10 years as an 
assistant nursery school teacher, because 
I didn™t have a degree. That was nice. 
Q: Had you known for a long tim
e that you wanted to  go back  an d get an  education, an d 
the degrees? 
A: No, not really. Actually -- 
Ash -- Ed pushed me, said ﬁWhy
 don™t you go to school?ﬂ 
And so I did, and I really enjoyed going to  
school, enjoyed very much going to social 
work  school, although again, it was kind of -- 
I don™t think there was any survivor in my 
class. There were lots of young people wh
o had gone to Ivy Le
ague schools, and I 
realized that my education was 
far less solid than th
eir education, that my papers were not 
very well written. But at that time, I was very
 lucky, Columbia Unis
 -- University School 
of So cial Work  had never ax -- never had acce
pted ex -- very, very  few older people. And 

when  I applied, they had -- they had to accep
t older people, so I was accepted, with some 
other older people. I was already in my 40™s. 
So I was lucky at that time. Social work 
school was interesting, because I was placed in 
-- my first inte
rnship was in an Protestant 
foster care agency, and there 
was a woman there who was, I thought that she was a little 
anti-Semitic, and -- well, a lot anti-Semitic, 
and which happene
d, I would almost say to 
be true. She -- The -- I was in the student 
unit, and there were two Orthodox Jewish 
student -- social work  students, and one was ta
king off all the holiday
s, and she was kind 
of punish ed for that, she eventually had to
 leave. And there were other things that 
happened that were kind of what I felt was 
anti-Semitic, and I feel very -- I felt very 
uncomfortable, and was about to quit, but I said, 
ﬁI can™t. I -- I need to get a social work 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050

degree. I must -- I must stay and -- and -- and co nquer this.ﬂ And I did, in a very -- it was, 
I felt, a very hostile environment. I finished 
the first year, but tha-that really was -- was 
very hard on me. The 
second year, luckily, I was placed 
in an -- in another place where 
there -- I had a Jewish supervisor, 
so she couldn™t be anti-Semitic.  
Q: Well, at that time, h o w much of your iden
tity had to  do with being Jewish, or being a 
survivor? I know you said that
 you didn™t -- didn™t have many 
survivor friends, you didn™t 
really know, sort of, you kn
ow, you -- there wasn™t a sort
 of community. How much was 
it part of your identity at that point? 

A: I think I wasn™t aware of it, that I -- it -- 
it was always there. I was always different, 
like I was saying to you, when 
I went to social work school,
 and all these young -- young 
s -- young men, women, who had 
gone to the very good scho
ols. I mean, I had nothing -- 
and I was older. I had nothing in common with
 them. Even the ones
 who were maybe in 
their late 20™s and early 30™s had -- I don™t 
think there was anyone
 who had gone through 
-- through what I had gone th
ro ugh. No [indecipherable] in
terest, somebody would say, 
you know, where you come from,
 I said from Holland, and ok
ay so, interesting, I like 
Holland, I like Amsterdam. They would sayto  me, ﬁPeople are friendly in Holland?ﬂ 
And you know, that was about it. People were 
not really interested, as I recall. I might 
also have given them messages that I didn™t wa
nt to talk about it. So, it wasn™t really -- it 
was a -- as you say, how mu ch 
was my identi -- I wasn™t so 
much aware of it, but it was 
always there. I always felt different. And if
 people were asking, 
an d -- about maybe you 
know, where were you in the wa
r, and in hiding, I di
dn™t want to talk about it, because it 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
20
 
 
 
 
felt uncomfortable. It felt uncomfortable 
because -- and it -- over and over and over 
again, I noticed that when I st arted to talk about it, people b
ecame very serious, and some 
people kind of looked  at me, and they became
 sad when I was talking about it. And I felt 
I inflicted pain on them, rather than not -- not inflict pain. That™s really what I always saw 
when  I would talk about it, and you know, 
when I would say, you know. If somebody 
would say to  -- how -- ﬁWhat happened  to 
you wh en you were a teenager?ﬂ You know, 
ﬁWere you allowed to wear silk stockings?ﬂ
 I mean, when I was 
a teenager, I was in 
hiding. I mean, or you know, it was su
ch -- it was funny bizarre, if you know 
[indecipherable] these questions. I was glad 
to have socks, you know? So, how could I 
explain th is to them, that you know, or that
 the main thing was th
at you know, in the 
morning that there was a piece of bread with maybe a little bit marmalade on it. That was 

-- That was wonderful, but going out -- 
Q: Tell me about with
in your family, with 
-- with your kids, and 
with your husband Ed, 
did -- you know, did you have conversations about -- 
A: About -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Like I said, it was always there. I can™t 
recall. I spoke less about
 it. When I took my  
daughter in 19 -- in -- when was it, 1976, ho
w old was she then? Ye
ah, 1976 to -- to 
Israel, and then later on to Holland, and intr
oduced her to my rescuers. I mean, there was 
always something going on, but it wasn™t very
 open, you know? I introduced my  daughter 
to my -- actually when 
we were in Holland the first tim
e, she knew already my  rescuers, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
21
 
 
 
 
so -- and then we went again in ™76, we agai
n mes -- met my rescuers. We t -- also took 
our son to Israel, and to -- to Ho lland, and a
ll -- France. He also met my rescuers. So it -- 
it was always there, but it wasn™t -- we didn ™t a -- they never aske
d, tell me now from the 
beginning, you know, wh
at happened. There were little funny
 stories sometimes, that we 
talked about. The interesting thing is our son 
spoke at our anniversar
y party, and he kind 
of said that when he was a teenager, he rea
lized that his parents were different from other 
parents. Something -- He didn™t realize when he
 was a kid, but he realized that we didn™t 
know a lot about baseball, or all these -- foo -- 
or football. He didn™t realize that, but later 
on he realized that we had a different hist
ory than his par -- than the parents of his 
American friends. So it was there, always, w
ith our children, because not only that, my 
mo ther-in-law had been  in Berg
en-Belsen, and my father-in-la
w always kind of protected 
her, because she had been in Bergen-Belsen, sh
e had suffered more than us. My father-in-
law, and my  brothers-in-law,
 and Ed were in hiding. My
 mother-in-law had su ffered 
more than an-anyone el
se, so it was always there, it was kind of there, and -- but not a 
whole lot of -- talked about. The kids knew,
 and it -- it -- it was there, yes. You know, 
everybody had an accent, to st
art out with. You know, my 
-- my mother, my mother-in-
law, my father-in-law, not my
 younger brothers-in-law. S -- 
He -- They knew they were 
children of immigrants, and -- an
d they were n -- interesting if
 -- is that my son™s best 
friend was a -- I don™t know exactly wh en his fa
ther came, his father was an immigrant. I 
don™t know if his father came in late 30™s or
 early 40™s. Father was originally born in 
Russia, went to France, and came here wh 
-- I don™t know if he was a survivor, but 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
22
 
 
 
 
maybe a refugee. My daughter™s very best 
friend father escaped from Poland, came here 
the United States. I don™t know ex -- he pr
obably was a refugee. And so there is 
something th at they got conn
ected up with people who had 
a simila r background. They 
didn™t quite know, I mean, what it was, they ju
st kind of discovered it later, that this was 
the -- the attraction, or the connection that
 they had with -- w
ith their friends. My 
daughter, later on, when she moved up to -- 
near Peekskill, across 
the road was another 
family, a y o ung family, and th -- and she 
was a daughter of a hol -- of hol -- two 
Holocaust survivors. Best fri
ends still, today.So someth
ing is, you know, they get 
connected with people who have
 a similar family history. 
Q: And when did th at start to happen fo r you?
 When did you start to beco me mo re of a 
community of survivors? 

A: Actually, in the early -- in 
the early 80 -- actually, probably  late 70™s, or early 80™s, I 
become more aware that I was different, that 
I had been  in hiding, and th ere must be a lot 
of people who were in h -- had been in hidi
ng, right around here, but I couldn™t get to 

them, and since I was a social worker, and wa
s a group -- also a group work er, I said, I -- 
I should maybe get this suppor
t group together. And what I did was I called the Dutch 
consulate, and I knew that othe
r Dutch Jewish immigrants were
 in -- had been registered 
there. And so -- And luckily, the woman I sp
oke to was a social 
worker, so she knew 
what I was talking ab out. And I ask her if 
I could send -- if she would send a letter from 
me to people she knew who had been in the wa
r in Holland, Jewish people wh o had been 

in war in Holland, and if th
ey wo uld then contact me , ma ybe we could meet. And so I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
23
 
 
 
 
started a support group, I think it was in 
1982, of Du tch Holo caust survivors who had 
been in hiding. And the diffi
culty was that I th -- that 
we came from New York City, 
Westchester county, New Jersey -- I had k-kind 
of asked her to send letters to the me -- 
metropolitan area. And we met the first time wa
s kind of an intere sting [indecipherable] 
maybe 20 people in -- in New 
York City. We met, and ther
e were older people who had 
been in hiding, and younger one
s, like people who had been in hiding wh en th ey were in 
their 20™s. And one man said immediately, 
he said, ﬁYou know, we don™t need  a group, 
we know who we are, but yo
u youngsters, you were
 children and teenagers, you didn™t ha 
-- you really didn™t have an identity. You suffer
ed more than we did, because we had an 
identity.ﬂ And he wasn™t so wrong, but I co
uldn™t quite understand what this was all 

about. And so we met another two years with
 the people who were younger, because the 
older people said you know, that we don™t want
 the group, and so on. We had this -- I had 
this support group with you
nger people who were children and teenag ers in the war. And 
that was very interesting, only difficult -- we
 had a difficu lt time to find a place to meet, 
and -- and that kind of -- like I said, it was tw
o years, that was until 1984. And so we had 
-- I ha -- I realized that y -- I found people 
I had something in co mmon with. I think wh at 
-- maybe what I™m not talking about is that we 
really kind of led a so-called normal social 
life here, in  -- in resh -- here in Hastings. 
You know, we went out, 
we had friends, we had 
dinner parties, but it -- it -- plus we were alwa
ys a little different. It wasn™t that we were 
completely isolated from -- fro
m -- you know, from our neighb
ors, or the parents of our 
friends, or friends we had made
 on our own. Bu t it wasn™t lik
e -- we didn™t quite belong, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
24
 
 
 
 
it -- I can tell you, we were at the dinner part
y, and people had invited some friends, and 
there were like a couple of couples, and th
ere were two couples w
ho didn™t know each 
other, and then they  found out that they gr
ew up on you know, in th
e same  neighborhood 
in the Bronx, and all of a sudden, they had su
ch a strong connection, 
even, to you know, I 
don™t know which one it was, Public PS wh at
ever, and do you know 
th at, you know, this 
one, and do you know that one, 
and wh at did you play in th
e street, stickball, and you 
know, we didn™t do this, whatev
er they play ed. And I realized, I never can meet anybody 
who I went to school with. So  these kind of
 things did happen, an
d I felt very kind of 
isolated, and when the -- when
 do I ever meet somebody I we
nt to school with? So, I 
guess wh at I wanted to say to you is we kind 
of led an -- an -- a normal social life here, 
but felt different, because we had gone thro
ugh the war. When we -- When I had the s-
support group of Du tch Hi
dden Ch ildren, we had some connection, I had some 
connection. And in the meantim
e, I had become a Social Work er, and I was wo rking as a 
Social Worker, and -- which was -- I -- I -- I 
loved my  wo rk, and -- but I didn™t have the 
same background as they had, although, you 
know, I was very well integrated in my, you 
know, professional community, of where I work
ed, at work, you know, there was -- I -- I 
-- I felt pretty -- pretty comfortable there.
 Then, in ni -- 1980 -- 1990, we did our 
interview in -- in -- in Washington, and it™s 
a very complicated stor
y how we -- how they 
-- how we found them, and how they found us
. We did go for a weekend to Washingt -- 
to be int -- to Washington to be interviewed,
 and I forgot ex -- was a terribly rainy day, 
and it wasn™t in the museum yet, because th
e museum wasn™t there yet, it was somewhere 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
25
 
 
 
 
else in the studio. And I remember that I wa
tched -- watched Ed on 
a monitor, but not in 
the same room, and he watched me on a monito
r, and we were completely wiped out after 
we had to ld the whole story. It was rea
lly from -- you probably saw -- you saw the video, 
so it was from early years, a
nd then into -- into the war ye
ars. And we were absolutely 
emotionally exhausted. And th at was really th
e very first time that I had told my whole 
story. I -- I even now get, you know, very move
d ab out it, and I don™t know why. So that 
was in 1990. At the same time
 -- at the same -- around that
 time, o n e of my colleagues 
gave me an -- he said, ﬁYou know, you mi
ght be,ﬂ -- I had spoken with him, I guess, 
about my background. He gave me an announcement of an -- of
 a conference in -- in New 
York City, about th
e psycho-his -- the psycho
-history association gave
 an -- an -- an -- an 
-- an -- an conference for child
ren of the Ho locaust. And it 
was -- he said, ﬁYou might be 
interested.ﬂ So, I said, ﬁYeah, I 
mi ght be interested to do that.ﬂ
 So I went there, I took a 
day off, I went to that seminar, and there was 
a whole row of people there sittin g behind a 
table, and -- and I was there, and I -- you kn
ow, somebody was going to  listen to all these 
papers they were going to present. And I liste
ned to the papers they were presenting th ere 
all about -- they were very professional and th
ey had done a lot of research on ch ildren of 
the Holo caust. And all I heard was kids who ha
d been in a concentration camp . And I, at 
one time I wanted to  ask -- I ask a question 
to these professional people, was -- one was 
Judith Kastneberg , and some others, Eva 
Fogelman, and some others, and I ask a 
question, if they had done any research on 
children who ha -- children of the Ho locaust 
who had been in hiding. And th ey said no, th
ey hadn™t, they don™t 
have any data on that. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
26
 
 
 
 
And somebody in the b
ack heard my  question, and came 
over to me, and she says, ﬁYou 
have been in  hiding?ﬂ And I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁY
ou know, we are planning a conferen ce for 
Holo caust survivors who had been  in hiding
, or children who had -- Holo caust survivors 
who had been in hiding, are you interested?ﬂ
 And I said, ﬁYes, I™m interested.ﬂ So, we 
exchanged telephone numb ers, and she said, a
nd there™s a meeting wh
enever, to -- in one 
week or two week. I went to that first meet --
 for me that first mee
tin g, of children -- wh-
which was -- which was later called Hidden
 Children of the Holocaust. And they p -- 
were planning a conference from the Memorial 
Day week end of ™9 1. And so I started to 
work with them, and I said, 
ﬁYou know, I™m a social worke
r, I can plan wo
rkshops.ﬂ And 
so I got connected to this group of people 
wh o all were -- had been in hiding, and -- and 
wherever, Poland, France, Belg
ium, not one from Holland. An
d we started to work  on 
this conference, which was very intense, a
nd regular, you know, meetings, and planning, 
and shouting, and arguing, an
d -- and was very interesti
ng. And I started my  work, 
getting work shop leaders togethe
r, I got -- you know, there were lots of people who had 
been in hiding, who were in the mental he
alth profession, so I had no problem finding 
psychiatrists, psychologists, social work ers, in
 this country, or overseas, or in Holland, or 
in England, or in Israel, I m
ean there were lots of them. 
So I began my  work  with the 
Hidden Children, and in a ki 
-- in a sense, I found my community. I -- I did things I had 
never done before. I didn™t know 
anything about how to organize
 worksh ops, but I did. I -
- I -- You know, we made all kinds of d
ecisions about -- about 
the conference, how 
confid ential it should be, who should -- what we
 -- we -- we planned wo rksh ops, we had 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
27
 
 
 
 
to give names, you know, we had to find 
out what was -- what would be appropriate 
work shop fo r people who had been  in hiding as
 children. And we came up with all kinds 
of -- you know, we got some consultants, th
ere™s a psychiatrist in -- in Vancouver, who 
was a hidi -- had been  in hiding as a child, wh
o had been  very involv
ed in child survivors 
of the Holocaust, so we -- we contacted him, and we -- we got all the names for the 
workshops, and -- and titles for th
e worksh ops, really. We had to
 read up on it, you know, 
like abandonment, trust, you know, relations
hips, all these problems of -- of people 
having because of the Holo caust, and 
the experiences th
ey went through. 
Q: What was that -- W h at was that like to all of
 a sudden look at thes
e issues in such an 
intellectual way, rather than ju
st from your own, you know -- 
A: From my own exp -- oh, it was wonderful to 
do it in that way. Was 
great, I mean, I -- 
well, don™t forget, I have been in  psychothera
py -- I ha -- in -- in therapy since ni -- I was 
in therapy already since 1979. 1
970, I had been in therapy, so
 I mean, I could look into -- 
intellectually in -- in a way that -- cause I 
had my  -- you know, I had done some work in  
therapy. There was -- I think wh
at happened that you felt kind of a little control, and a 
little power, to do it like that, you know. It wasn™t
 that easy when  people talked  about it, 
you know, when  other people 
talked about how they were 
abandoned by 
their mother, 
when  their mo ther waved them goodbye, or wh
en  they  were placed in a convent, you 
know, I mean that -- that
 wasn™t easy to kind of listen to. 
But to plan it, wonderful. I still -

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of th
e interview with Carla Lessing, an
d this is tape two, side A. 
And you were just -- actually, I want
 to backtrack just
 a little bit -- 
A: Go ah ead. 
Q: -- from where you were before
, when you -- you said you di
d the first video interview, 
and that was the first time that
 you really told your whole story , sort of [indecipherable] 
A: Chronologically, right. 

Q: And -- And I wonder if you just could talk
 about that a little b
it more, what that was 
like to begin to see that expe
rience as a -- as a story? 
A: You know, you talked about
 how was it intellectually, yo
u know, you can do all these 
work shops, you know, that -- 
the titles of the workshops
, and you can talk about 
abandonment, and all this kind of stuff, and th
e -- the interesting thing is that when I have 
written a -- a paper about the va
nished culture of Holocaust 
survivors, and I was just 
going to  be published th is summer, and I write 
about it, that there ar
e other therapies for 
Holo caust survivors, other than individual an
d group therapy. There -- Such as giving a 
testimony in  a chronological order, not only 
th at you™re going to  validated, but somebody 
is listening, and that your -- for whatever hours 
it is, to your story, ra
ther than to just a 
brief segment, and -- but that you are being 
validated, that you go through it, that it is 
your story, that -- a
nd not only I say that it is, you know,
 therapeutically very important 
for anyone to tell their whole 
story, chronologically, other professionals, I mean I -- it™s 

not my  inve -- you know, I didn™t find that out,
 I -- I read that over and over again, from 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
30
 
 
 
 
other professionals. It is -- I didn™t realize th
at it was so important. Not that I™m watching 
my  video, I never look at it, I -- you know, bu
t it™s there, and we gave it to our children, 
as a document. And you can see I get -- ev
ery time [indecipherable] and I don™t know 

why. Because I have kept it -- You know, 
one of the workshops we have, keeping -- 
keeping a secret, I -- I actually 
did the work shop, keepin g -- k
eeping a secret, and this is 
what we really have done, be
cause we wanted to lead a normal life. And we succeeded. 
You know, we had -- we had a family, we ha
d children, we went 
to the PTA meetings, 
we went -- we went on vacations with our 
children, but there was so much else. So, I 
think that when I did this inte
rview, in a sense, for the fi
rst time somebody listened, and 
asked me questions. Like I said, I was -- I 
s -- I was -- I was va
lidated, it was -- it 
appeared to be a very important document. A
nd when I so casually 
said, you know, they  
take a little s -- you know, a little piece out of, 
then put it on the -- I wasn™t pleased with 
what they took out at
 the mu seum, but it™s there, and -- 
and you know, wh en  my  -- my  -- 
one of my daughter™s friends went to the mu
seum, and she said, ﬁI saw your mo ther on 
the -- you know, on th -- on the -- on th e vide
o.ﬂ Or -- And so mebody else said, ﬁI looked 
for you on th e video.ﬂ Something happened , so
mething -- and like I said, something -- the 
story that I kept hidden all these years is now out in th e open. So , I think that™s important. 
It™s -- It seems to be more important than 
writing it down, because when I -- when I wrote 
my  paper, or -- or when I spoke, you know at
 some conferences about it, it isn™t the same. 
It™s not that I™m talking about my self in th
e paper, but it™s about Holo caust survivors and 
their losses, and their -- the -- the terrible harm
 that it has done to people who have been 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
31
 
 
 
 
in the Ho locaust emotionally, and how people
 have continuously to
 suffer, some more, 
some less, and you know, s -- mo st of us ev
ery day think about the Holo caust in -- in a 
very -- sometimes just a minute, you know, or
 -- or some times longer, but there™s always 
a reminder, something. There™s always in your
 life a reminder of the -- those years that 

we were in hiding, or even be
fore. See, you mu st have seen in my  video, that wh en I was 
in Germany with my  grandparent
s, I already was persecuted there in a s -- in a sense, 
because I couldn™t -- like [indecipherable] a
nd my grandfather said, ﬁOh, you may not 
speak loudly, you may -- don™t -- don™t draw a
ny attention to yourself.ﬂ And I saw -- you 

know, I saw the SS  already marching around. So
 I grew up with -- for a long time since  
1936 until 1945. So I 
-- My -- My -- My whole life until 
1945 was the Ho
locaust really, 
you know? So when  it is -- when
 I gathered -- when  -- you were asking ab out the video, I 
think it was very important for me, and that I 
had a -- like I said, it™s been -- it™s stored 
away, and I don™t think of it. 

Q: [indecipherable] just  to know it™s there? 

A: No, I actually -- maybe to know
 that it™s there. I don™t know
 what™s going to happen to 
it when I™m not here any more, but it™s th
ere. And -- And -- And there are so many 
[indecipherable] I don™t know how important
 -- it™s important for my  family, my  

countrymen. We were a -- a -- I don™t know 
if you know, we were also interviewed by 
Jane Marks, who published 
the book, ﬁHidden Ch ildren: Secret Survivors of the 
Holo caust.ﬂ I don™t know if you
 know that. And our stories 
is in that book, and -- and 
people read our story. It™s -- It wasn™t so 
intense as the one in 
the -- you know, in 1990.

This was after the conferences she did this . Actually, in February of ™91, I was 
interviewed by New York Magazi
ne, and I also told my  story there, and it was published 
in the New York  Magazine, with five othe
rs who were in hiding. That wasn™t as 

important to me as the -- as the video. Yo
u know, it™s -- it™s -- I™m in a magazine, you 
know, so -- and my  story is in there, so people
 read it. It didn™t have the depth of it, you 
know? Because he edited it, of
 course, a lot, you know? 
Q: [indecipherable] the whole story from beginning to  end? 

A: Now I don™t know. I -- I don™t -- I don™t know
 exactly  wh at it is. I -- I guess I don™t 
want to minimize this, but I guess the video 
makes it more real, because I™m there, I™m 
talking. But it is printed, it™s kind of I 
have given it away, you know? And -- And th e 
person who interviewed me, and edited it, it b
ecomes mo re her story. I don™t know, I -- I 
did something with it that I don™t know I wa
nt -- I don™t know wh at I did with it. It™s 
really what -- what -- what this video di
d fo r me. Is there anything else that you 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Well, a couple other things
 just in terms of how, you 
know, as you lo
ok back on your 
experiences, and how it shaped 
who you™ve become now, in te
rms of things like, let™s 
talk about religion, first off. I know that in y
our video interview you 
say, one thing that I 
thought was very interesting, 
about how proud you were to we
ar a yellow star, and to be 
Jewish. 
A: Mm-hm.  
Q: And -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
33
 
 
 
 
A: Not Jewish as a religious person, Jewish 
as [indecipherable] people. One experience I 
reme mb er is that when I was in hiding in
 the second -- with the second family, maybe a 
year into that, so let™s say th
at 19 - 1943 - 1944, at one tim
e I realized I don™t understand 
that I -- I, o r any -- or my mother, my brother,
 had to go through this
. Cause we were kind 
of innocen t people, we didn™t harm anybody.
 And if there was a god, why -- why did He 
do th is? Why did He do this to us, and to th
e other Jews? And in particularly there was 
round -- when we -- we -- before the war, ther
e was a Je wish famil y
 around the corner, 
they had two very  small children, babies, an
d they -- somehow we 
knew that they were 
not in hiding, I don™t know why,
 but that they were shipped -- that they went to -- to the 
camps, and I just could remember these little girls, and [indecipherable] what happened 
to them, and -- and you know, that they w
ould not sleep in their own beds, and they 
would be somewhere in -- in Westerbork, an
d I don™t know what would happen to them, 
we didn™t quite know what 
happened to them. These littl
e kids, you know? Horrible, 
when I think about it. So I -- I -- At the 
time when I was in hi
ding, I think ab out 
[indecipherable] of God. Why, why did He put
 us here? I mean, in hiding, we afraid 
every day fo r your life, and for the other people
™s lives. So, I kind of 
said, I -- I don™t es -- 
I don™t believe there is a God. And I still don™t 
-- I mean, I™m still stru
ggling with this in a 
sense, because I don™t know how this all ha
ppened around me. But we are not religious. 

We celebrate Hanukah, and Pesach, and Rosh
 Hashanah, mo-more as
 a -- as a tradition, 
and as ee -- having a Jewish id
entity, not necessarily religious
 identity. And we were also 
[indecipherable], so we got kind of an -- a 
different identity. When 
you go to  Israel, you -

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
34
 
 
 
 
- you don™t need to be religi
ous to be Jewish. So, our chil
dren were not Bar Mitzvahed, 
and Bat Mitzvahed, we have ne
ver belonged to -- to
 a temple, we are not affiliated. But 
when my mother -- befo
re my mother died, I went to a 
- to the temple down here, it™s a 
Reform temple, went to the rabbi, if he wanted 
to do a service, and he said yes. And wh en 
my mother died, I went down there, and he
 did the service -- graveside service, you 
know? So there is some -- I 
think it is more -- my Jewi
shness is more connected to 
tradition, and to the Jewish people, rather th
an to religion. I went a little bit to Hebrew 
school in Ho lland, but that was not a very go
od experience, because my  mo ther sent us to 
shul on the holid ays, and sh e usually didn™t
 go, and -- and it was very boring, and it was 
all in Hebrew, and we didn™t understand an
ything, and -- and -- you know, the men were 
there, and the wo men were upstairs, and it 
was not a good experience. So, I guess you get 
the picture.  
Q: How about in terms of your [indecipher
able] family, and -- you -- you talked a little 
bit today about the importance of
 having, you said, a normal life. 
A: Oh. I think what we all -- 
mo st of us who went thro u
gh the war wanted to lead a 
normal life, which meant getting married, and ha
ving children, although there are many -- 
quite a few hidden ch ildren who never 
got married because they™re -- they 
[indecipherable] had a terrible hard time with 
relationships. With -- I got married when I 
was 19, and -- and I think that™s the mo st importa
nt thing, to have a family lead so called 

a normal life, have -- our -- both our children 
got married, they both have two ch ildren. 
It™s amazin g . I mean, that -- that this happened
 after we were not supposed to be here. So 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
35
 
 
 
 
when  -- when we had our anniversary, and 
yo-you know, months ago, there were our 
children and our gran dchildren. Unbelievable, 
you know? So I think that™s -- th -the -- the 
accomplishment that we -- I™m mo st proud of. 
And they seem to -- 
a little -- I™m -- our 
children are affected by our Holocaust experien
ce, they seem to be managing quite well. 
My daughter is married for 23 
years. Our son is married for 10
 years, mo re than 10 years. 
So somehow we have instilled in our childre
n that family is important. They™re good 
parents, they are extremely good parents, so
metimes a little too permissive, but they™re 
good parents, they love th
eir children very mu ch. And yo
u see it every day, you know? 
They -- So, I think that that™s
 my proudest ac
complishment. 
Q: Is there anything else 
that you would want to add? 
A: To what? To family? 
Q: To everything. 
A: Oh. Oh, the -- you want 
to know a little bit? How 
much more do we have? 
Q: We -- We have enough time. 
A: Well, the -- the -- the mo -- the other impor
tant thing is that -- I was telling you about 
working on the Hidden Child c
onference, and that we did have the conference, and it was 
an incredible success. We had -- We had 
expected 300 - 400 people, there was 1600 
people and we didn™t know what to do, th
e people in th e work shops, that were like 
work shops -- 75 people [indecipherable] you 
know, th e work shops [indecipherable]. But 

it was such a success, a nd it changed ma
ny people™s lives, including my  husband™s, 
which you probably will hear
 on tape. It changed because
 people found each other, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
36
 
 
 
 
connected with each other, and 
what we did after the conference, we started support 
groups, and I™m still running a s
upport group here in Westches
ter co unty. We just had a 
meeting yesterday. So that™s from August of 
™91 until now, is eight years, we run -- once 
a month we have a meeting. It™s not always 
easy, but we do have a 
meeting, and I have 
been working since then for th
e Hidden Child Foundation, wh
ich is the organization, and 
in the last few years since I 
retired from the clinic, and I onl
y wo rking part time at night, 
private practice, I am workin
g with Holocaust -- needy Holo
caust survivors. What I™m 
doing is trying to help them connect with res
ources, financial or psychological resources, 
so that they don™t continue to su ffer unne
cessarily. And that keep
s me  quite busy. I go 
once a week  to New York City
, and I work with -- I -- w
ith agencies, or with the 
Holocaust survivors. 
They don™t [indecipherab le] to ha
ve been in hiding, anyone -- 
anyone who was in concentratio
n camp , or child of Holo caust survivors who are needy 
for whatever, psychological services, or fina
ncial services, I will co nnect them up with 
whatever is available. So, that
 fills kind of, my life. This is not all, you know, because I s-
spend about two -- two and a half days in 
my private practice. I have my family, 
whenever they want to
 come over [indecipherable] we alwa
ys there. But it is a major part 
of my life to be involved in 
Ho locaust survivors, and their -- their needs, or just maybe a 
party or an  -- an -- like we had yesterday 
a brunch, wh ere people get together and 
connect, because that™s really 
one of the most important things for the survivors, to 
connect with others. So -- B
ecause, for instance, with hi
ding, we understand what it 
means -- w h en I talk to somebo
dy else who has been in hidi
ng, I know what it means to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 
 
37
 
 
 
 
be -- have been in hiding, 
and have your schooling in
terrupted, your family life 
interrupted, your friendships interrupted , 
everything in terrupted , I never was normal 
again after that.  
Q: What -- What is it about you and your husb
and that have led you both to become so 
involved in this way, wh
ere others may -- may not? 
A: Well, Ed wasn™t involved in  the planning of
 the conference. I did -- I kind of dragged 
him along. And then  he got in
volved very mu ch when  -- with
 the sh -- with the Shoah 
Foundation, when he started to do the interv
iews, he got very involved, wh ich is only I 
think the last three years or so. I don™t kn
ow -- I am involved because I think I can 
contribute. It™s my community
. Although socially we don™t 
get together, it™s -- it™s an 
interesting contradiction. I can wo rk with th
em, but socially, you know, with a few, but 
not with the whole -- with all th
e people that I am in contact
 with. I can only -- it -- it -- it 
feels -- it feels good to -- to do this. It -- I ha
 -- kind of -- I can contribute because I™m a 
social worker, ca -- ca -- I can 
do the work, it™s not difficult for 
me to do this. I -- I can™t 
really tell you why -- it -- it -- it 
just -- that™s what I need to
 do. I can also tell you th at I 
never was a memb er of any or
ganization before this. I neve
r was a memb er of Hadassah, 
I never was a member of, like I say, of 
the temp le. I never was a memb er of any 
organization befo re I got connected to the 
Hidden Ch ild Foundation. I didn™t belong, I 
didn™t feel comfortable, I -- I me -- I mean, 
I am now a member of the Clinical Social 
Work Society, I go to thei
r meetings, but it™s not the same, it™s a professional 
organization. So , I guess that™s where I feel I belong.
