On November
 
9, through November  10, 1938, the Nazis  c ar ried out a nationwide Pogr om 
agains t Germany's  J
ews , known as  Kris tallnac ht, Night of Br oken Glas s. Aler ted to the danger, J ill and 
her  fam ily fled to Cologne.
 
 
J ill's  family dec ided to em igr ate from Germ any and in May of 1939, they left for  Kenya. In this  
photo we s ee J ill, who is  on the r ight, and Inge while on the Germ an s hip that took them on a two

J ill Pauly.

> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, J ill. Thank  you s o muc h for  joining us  and for being willing to be our Firs t 

Pers on today. We have jus t an hour and you have a gr eat deal to share with us  s o we are going to s tart 

r ight 
away.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Ok .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e, J ill, that Kr istallnac ht, Night of Broken Glas s , was  the c atalys t for the 
dir ec tions  and dec is ions  that your fam ily's  life took  for  the balanc e of the Holoc aus t and the war. You 
were very young at tha
t 
tim e, just 5 year s  of age. Let™s  begin with you telling us  about your family and 
the events and your fam ily's  life leading up to Kristallnac ht and that c atalytic  event for you and your  

family.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Ac tually, I was  thinking about it this m orning or las t night, about the gener ations of my 
family going back in the area near  Cologne, one hour  by c ar from Holland. I pers onally have genealogy 
that go back  to the ear ly 1700s  in that ar ea.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Som e 300 year s ' wor th of fam ily.
 
> > J ill P auly
:  Yes . And m y father's  m other, my gr andm other, who lived with us until s he pas s ed away, 
we lived together, told the fam ily that s he believed her anc es tor s es c aped the Inquis ition in Spain and 
the family moved
 
--
 
we don't know wher e to but landed up in a city Cr efeld, als o about 45 m inutes from  
Holland. Now, they might not have s ettled there r ight away. I have a feeling that a lot of the J ews  that 
c am e up through Spain and upward went to The Nether lands .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > J ill Pauly:  And then wandered over . That's  one s ide. The other s ide I don't know. Been there 

forever . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about your parents . What was  your father's  oc c upation?
 

4 
 
> > Jill Pauly:  My father was  a c attle dealer . Going back to the 1600s  there were two profess ions  
that 
the c hur c hes permitted the Jews  to go into
:  
one was  hors e tr aining; the other was  c attle dealing. Thes e 
people wer e s m all farm ers , land keeper s , Orthodox J ews , in m y c as e. They had s m all bus ines s es.
 
I r ead s om e stuff on it. They had to go to c ourt becaus e s om ebody did s omething to their c ow. It was  
little tiny bus ines s .
 
 
By the time m y late father  was  mar ried, they had a big c attle bus ines s. There were four 
par tners  in it, fam ily. They had land. They had hous es . They had money. They did well.
 
 
My father  really was  a ver y c r eative per s on and superbly talented with animals . So m uc h s o, 
when he cam e to the United States and s ettled in New J er s ey
 
--
 
what do 
you 
c all a doctor
 
--
 
the 
veter inarian. The veterinar ian in the area would pic k him up at 4:00, 5:00
 i
n the mor ning, whic h 
dis turbed ever ybody. Wher e did you go at 4:00, 5:00
 
in the mor ning?
 
He would c ome back and say, 
ﬁW
ell, he had a ver y s er ious  c as e and I tried to help him  s ave the anim al.
ﬂ 
> > Bill Bens on:  So he knew his  bus ines s .
 
> > J ill P auly:  He kn
ew his  bus ines s .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Nazis  c am e to power  in 1933, five years  before Kristallnac ht. Right away 

r es tr ic tions  on J ews  began. One of the things  you had told m e, that keeping kos her was  for bidden by 

the Nazis  and yet at c ons iderable risk your family  c ontinued to do s o. Tell us  how they managed that.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  It was  a form  of r es is tanc e. They were very c our ageous. They dec ided
 
--
 
they had been 
forbidden s laughter ing, forbidden to do bus ines s  in 1937. You know, they wer e hem med in.
 
There we
r e 
families  in the area, thank  God, wher e we lived that were very anti
-
Nazi that eventually helped them a 
lot. But they went on our own with this  kos her s laughtering. J ust wouldn't give it up. I gues s  99% of the 

people did. They wer e the 1% that wouldn't. They took  r isks. They were r aided. Our hous e was  r aided. 

I don't rem em ber that. I m us t have been there. And my unc le had hiding plac es  for thes e spec ial 

knives . He s tr apped them  to the ins ide of the c himney. They didn't get them. And they c ontinued doing 

i
t.

I had one unc le
 
--
 
I went bac k  in 2012. I went to his  hous e where they lived. And I tried to s ee 
if my memory
 
--
 
nothing kicked in. But I s aw a r etaining wall on one s ide of the yar d that had hooks built 
into it. And I asked the wom an who took  m e there
, I s aid, "What are thos e for, thos e round things ?"  
She s aid, "They us ed to tie up the c attle ther e."
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the wall.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  He had an 
abattoir
. He was  a kosher s laughter er. He was  the one in the family that 
pr oduc ed and s old the me
at. He dec ided to c ontinue doing it. And what he did
 
--
 
he had a Nazi right 
next door who watc hed ever y s tep they took . He did the kos her killing. He had a m an help him  that he 
tr usted. And then he took  a gun and s hot to the severed head s o the neighbor  next door would think  
they s hot the animal and had no way of pr oving he didn't. They were really defiant.
 
 
Ac c ording to 
Je
wis h law
,  
when you'r e under that kind of pr es s ure, you don't have to k eep 
thes e laws . But they als o didn't know how long it would las t b
ec aus e their non
-
J ewis h fr iends  told them  
this  is  r idic ulous ; this  
c an't la
st. 
> > Bill Bens on:  This guy Hitler  is  not going to las t.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  No!  They thought he was  c razy. That was  a sm all perc entage.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right. J ill, you ar e four ye
ars  younger  than your s is ter
,  
Inge. So at that time you were 
not in sc hool but Inge was  in s c hool. Tell us  a little bit, from what you know fr om Inge, what her s c hool 
experienc e was  like.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  It was  r eally s ad, really. This  is an exam ple of what J ewis h c hildren had to go through. 
They s ent her to
 
--
 
by the way, s c hooling was  c om puls or y. So they s ent her  to the c ommunity public  
s c hool. She was 6. She was  beaten by a boy. She tur ned ar ound and hit him. She hit him  on the nos e, I 
think . She jus t str uck  out and he was  bleeding. And m y par ents bec ame very frightened. They took  her 

out of the school. So at the age of 6 s he was  s ent away fr om  hom e. This  goes  for many, many of the 

Germ an J ewis h c hildr en. They c ould not stay at home to go to s c hool because there were no J ewis h 

s c hools  in villages  and they wer e too young to c omm ute to the big c ities . So the c hildren had to be 

6 
 
m oved.
 
Luckily ther e was  a sc hoolhous e wher e my gr andmother lived, in another c ity, another  town. 
She lived with my gr andmother and an aunt. It was  ver y s ad. 
 
 
There was  a s c hool teacher  ther e who was  r eally well
-
known. His  nam e was  Lar a Gottlieb. He 
had from firs t grade to eight grade in one r oom. He taught Hebrew, Hebr ew reading. It was  J ewis h.
 
And 
at the s ame tim e, they als o had s ec ular  studies . He was  outs tanding. I mean, what m y s is ter had by the 
age of 9 was unbelievable. And I r ead his  his tor y, his  s tory. He would not leave town where he was . He 

s aid he had never  done anything to anyone. He was n't politic al. He was n't into anything detrim ental. 

Nobody had any is s ues  with him, s o he felt people wouldn't do anything to him. They picked him up. 

They s ent him to the c am ps. I c an't r emember whic h one but he was  m urdered in a c am p. He was  
r eally a very innoc ent m an.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  J ill
, of cours e, five year s  after Hitler c ame to power, the night of Novem ber
 
9 thr ough 
10, 1938 is  what we c all Kris tallnac ht or  Night of Br oken Glas s . Tell us  what you rec all and what you 
know about the events  of that terrible night and what happened that ni
ght for  your  family.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Kr is tallnac ht happened in the morning, Novem ber
 
9, 1939. I was  5
 
1/2. For s om e reas on, 
m y gr andpar ents and I were s itting in the living room, where we never  s at. We us ually wer e in the 

kitchen but we wer e in the living room bec aus e there was  a little s tove in ther e. I think  it was  c old that 

Novem ber night. There was  a knock  on the door at 9:00
 
in the m orning by a r ighteous  gentile, a fr iend. 
He told my father not to go near the s ynagogue that day. My father was  dres s ed t
o go. I rem em ber he 
was  wearing a white s hir t. It was  9:00. My father s aid, 
ﬁW
hy?
ﬂ
  
He s aid, "Don't ask m e why. If I tell you 
not to go. Don't go." He says , "But I don't k now what you're talking about. What's  happening?"  The guy 

s aid, "It's s om ething bad." And he left.
 
 
Well, that r eally
 
--
 
until then the phones  hadn't r ung. They hadn't hear d anything. It was  not in 
the news paper . It was n't announc ed, of c ours e. And s tarted s cr eaming. They were s o terr ified. Didn't 

know wher e to go, what to do. I gues s ther e were a lot of r ec r im inations  about not having left when they 

s hould have left. 
 

7 
 
 
My gr andmother had a broken leg. Her leg was  in a cast. She was  a ver y heav y woman. She 
jum ped out of that c hair  and s he s aid, "Call a dr iver . We'r e leaving." We'r e leaving , you know. Leaving 
wher e?  Doing what?  Wher e ar e you going?  She dec ided to get the dr iv er , who was  a non
-
J ewish 
m an, a friend, but he did it for money, it was  his  bus ines s , and he took  m y s is ter and I and the 

grandpar ents .
 
 
And m y God when we c ame out
- - 
> > Bill Bens on:  Separ ately fr om your par ents ?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Separately. They rem oved us  fr om the parents . And when we c ame out the fr ont door , 

m y s is ter started to sc r eam . When I saw her  s o terr or ized, I s uppos e I s tarted s c ream ing, too. And what 
was  
going on is we wer e s m elling smoke. We were s eeing flakes fly thr ough the air . It was  gr ay. It was  
the s ynagogue burning. It was  just a block  and a half up the s tr eet. 
 
 
They s tuffed us in the c ar. My gr andm other s aid, "Get down on the floor. Put your  fac e
 
down." 
We did. And s he put her feet on one of us and m y gr andfather  put his feet on the other one. It r eally 
helped it quieted us  down.We wer e not allowed to get up until we were c los e to Cologne. Then s he let 
us  look out the window. And I rem em ber seeing fires . Som ething dusky. 
 
 
I r em ember s eeing the Nazi flags  for firs t time. They r eally kept me under wr aps . I was n't out 
of the hous e without an adult ever . I couldn't play in our own bac kyar d becaus e m y m other was  afraid 
of being overlooked by neighbor s' teenaged c hildren who m ight be in the Nazi Party.
 
So to m e this  was  
like, they wer e beautiful, thos e flags . The colors  were pretty. 
 
 
The guy drove us  to a street. We got out. And we went into an apartment wher e four  unc le 
and aunts lived together in r etirement. It was  a two
-
bedr oom  apar tm ent. I don't even r em ember that. I 
s poke to my s is ter las t night. She s aid, "You know, that was  a two
-
bedr oom  apartm ent and we were 12 
people in there." What I do r em ember  very muc h is  the instr uctions  the adult
s  gave us . That fr ightened 
m e to the point, I gues s, of depr es s ion. I was  unhappy in that apartm ent with all of thes e adults, s om e 

of them older  no c hildren
 
--
 
you know, I never had c hildren to play with. It was  jus t awful. I reacted very 
badly.
 
I had a pers onality c hange over night. 
 

8 
 
 
At home in the c ountry, in the hous e where we liv ed, m y grandmother  was  ver y 
good
 
at 
keeping m e oc c upied but once I was  in that apartment s he was n't ther e and m y grandfather was n't 
ther e. And m y mother was
 
--
 
s he had
 
a s ick  mother in the apartment who was  dying of c anc er, nobody 
had r oom  for anything. There wer e no beds  for us.We didn't s leep in a bed, my s is ter and I, for 18 

m onths, until we wer e s ettled.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was your father in the hous e with you?
 

>> Ji
ll Pauly:  No. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Tell us  about your  father .
 
> > J ill Pauly:  No. The men r an away. They took  the fam ily c ar s  and kept driving.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause the J ewis h m en were being rounded up.
 

> > J ill P auly:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  30,000 in tota
l, I believe.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yes . But they didn't know that then. They just knew they wer e going to be picked up.
 
So they got in c ars  and they dr ove. They eventually end up in the woods , over night. They heard, the 
next m or ning, that it was  c alled off. That does n't mean they weren't picking people up anym or e but that 
the looting, the beating, and the des truction was  c alled off.
 
 
I have to tell you
 
40 years  later what happened. I went bac k  to Germany
 
the
 
first tim e in 1982. 
A wom an c am e to vis it me. She want
ed to m eet me. I never  met her  before. I didn't k now who s he was . 
And s he asked m e
 
--
 
s he s aid, "I have a par tic ular ques tion. What was  your  father and his  br others  
doing at the gas  station in Lec henic h on Kris tallnac ht?" 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  40 years later s
he asked you this  question?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yeah. 1982. I said, "Well, I would pr es ume they wer e getting gas oline.Why ar e you 

as king m e?"  She s aid, "Bec aus e I was  there. I saw them ." Luck . 10 years  old it would have been very 

eas y for  this  little gir l to
 
repor t that the J ews  wer e at the gas  s tation jus t now.
 

9 
 
 
I c ame back to New York , to the states , and I ask ed my mother  about this  bec aus e I was  
c ur ious . And s he s aid, "Yes . That was  a gas  station that was  willing to sell gas to the J ews  and not 
r eport them
." So it was  luc k .
 
 
Kr is tallnac ht was  on a Thur s day. On a Friday after noon the m en c ame into Cologne for  the 
Sabbath. And on Sunday mor ning
 
--
 
no it must have been im mediate bec aus e they left. Satur day night 
we went upstair s into the building wher e the apartm ent was , wher e we were gathered. And m y father  

was  going to go into hiding with us  in the attic
, l
ik e other s  did. And thank  God
 
--
 
Inge s cr eamed at night. 
She had nightmares . So he knew they c ouldn't s tay there. So on Sunday they all got in a c ar, thr ee
 
m en, and dr ove into Holland without perm is s ion. They wer e c aught. They were put in pr is on. And that's 
a whole differ ent part of the s tor y, the Dutc h par t.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Why don't you c ontinue with that part of it.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Ok .
 
 
My par ents  were ver y c onnec ted in Holland bec aus e it was an hour away by c ar. My father did 
a lot of bus ines s  ther e
, a
nd m y unc les . And two of m y unc le
s 
and an aunt left Ger m any in 1937 to go to 
Holland becaus e you c ouldn't make a living in Ger many any longer. The unc les  u
s ed to work for a 
c om pany, the two unc les. And the c om pany was  c los ed down by the Nazis . In 1937
 
th
ey got a c ar d, a 
little pos tc ar d fr om the gover nm ent, that they were no longer allowed to do bus ines s . 
 
 
So my family was  not func tioning, the 
bus ines s was n'
t functioning
, 
s o this  fam ily had to go to 
Holland. And when they got to Holland, they wer en't allowed to work bec aus e they c ame in and Holland 
had already been oc c upied by m aybe 30,000 Germ an J ews  and the Dutc h wer e having ec onom ic  
pr oblem s  s o they for bid
 
them  to work. If they had m oney to live on, fine
. I
f they didn't, that was  tough.
 
 
But they wer e c onnected there. And through the connec tion in Holland
 
--
 
one of my uncles  
was  a par tis an. He used to take news paper s to the r iver, to the water , whatever  wat
er  ther e was , I don't 
know, and us ed to s it ther e and read news paper s . And J ews  s wam over from Germ any.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Acros s the bor der .

> > J ill P auly:  Mm
-
hm m. They s wam . And he had c oats  with him and news papers  and handed them 
c oats  and news papers . And they dis appear ed into Holland. He was  guts y. He was  in his  20s. He was  
fluent in Dutc h. He was  born on the Dutc h border.
 
 
He c ame to s ee the men in the pris on.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Where your  father  was .
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Wher e the thr ee men, m y father and m y two unc les . He s aid to the pris on guar d, "What 

ar e you going to do with these people?
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
I'm sending them back  to Germany tom orr ow morning." He 
was  a Nazi. And m y unc le s aid, "You c an't do that. It's  against the law." "You have to have wr itten 

per mis s ion f
r om  The Hague." He had c alled an attorney before. "And you can't s end them back  without 
that written per m iss ion." So the guy s aid, "You bet I will if I don't have that piec e of paper." He got him 

that piec e of paper. And believe it or not, they wer e c onnected to a m an who was  the c our t J ew to the 

queen.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The queen of the Netherlands ?
 

> > J ill Pauly:  The queen of the Nether lands  wrote a per mis s ion for thes e thr ee m en to stay inter ned in 
Holland in a c am p, until they c ould leave. She s aved their lives . They wer e in an inter nm ent c am p for  
nine m onths . It was n't a c onc entr ation c am p but they s uffered ter r ibly fr om being c ut off from 

ever ybody. They c ouldn't c ommunic ate.
 

 
My unc le told me that my father was  des perate in that c am p. Ever ything he
 
had in his life was  
in Germany.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Inc luding the r est of his family.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So, J ill, her e's your  father and your two uncles  interned in Holland. They c an't get out 

of there. And now the res t of the fam ily r eally s prings into ac tion. Your family m akes  a dec is ion that we 

m us t leave Germ any. And you wer e able to ac c om plis h that by J une, I believe it was , 1939, about 

s even months after Kristallnac ht.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Yes .
 

11
 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us how that c am e about, what the family went thr ough in order for you to leave 
Germ any knowing that they felt they had to get out of there.
 

> > J ill Pauly:  They knew that befor e. I think it was  on the table from  1935.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Mm
-
hmm.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  But m y father  was
 
the kind of man who didn't want to go to a c ountry wher e he c ouldn't 
m ake a living. He had s even people to s uppor t. My mother s aid he s pent a whole year  of 1937 looking 
for a way out. He c ouldn't work at home.
 
 
By the way, I r eally need to br ing this  up. A pos tcar d telling people as of this  day you m ay not 
c ontinue making a living. So that had to be obeyed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your c areer , your  livelihood is  over
, 
that postc ard.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  One m onth later I s aw the pos tc ard. I don't know what happened to
 
it. I have it in my 
papers  som ewher e. 1s t of J anuary
 
1938, telling my father  and the fam ily that ever ything they own now 
belongs  to the state.
 
So m aking a dec is ion to leave the c ountr y was  not that diffic ult. The diffic ulty was  
ther e wer e no c ountries letting people in. Half of the J ews  of Germ any left befor e Kr is tallnac ht but m ost 

of them went to s urr ounding c ountr ies and they were c aught up in the war . So it was  
p
os s ible to get 
out. We just c ouldn't get in anywhere.
 
 
The woman that m arried into the famil
y c ame fr om a very educ ated family . She had a c ous in 
who s aw Hitler s peak on the street in Munic h in the 
`
20s. He had made a dec is ion that as  s oon as he 
got finis hed with his  univ er s ity he was  leaving and he went to England. And he and his  partner  star ted 
a 

c hemic al fac tor y. This  man had a s ideline. He helped J ews  get out of Germany into som ewhere.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr om his  plac e in England.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  From his  plac e in England. He had brought over  his  brother , out of Germany, put him 
through law s c hool. This  brother got a job with a com pany in Nair obi, Kenya, a law firm. So in 1937, his  

br other went to Nairobi.
 
 
Three or four years  ago we got letter s  that pas s ed between the families . This  m an
 
--
 
his name 
was  Her man Str aus s, was  in this c om pany in Nair obi wher e ther e was  a man who had very good 

12
 
 
r elations  with the Britis h gover nment. I believe he was  J ewis h. And through that c onnec tion, and the 
m oney that m y gr andmother  s ent out of the c ountry the day I was  bor n
 
--
 
she s ent the bus ines s m oney 
into Holland. She wouldn't allow it to stay in Ger many in any bank. So with that m oney s he was  able to 
fac ilitate a getting out.
   
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So he was  able to purc has e affidavits  or  vis as that allowed you to travel to Kenya?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  They allowed us  
to 
c om e in. And when they found out that the family had money, they 
bec ame ver y inter es ted, acc or ding to the letters . And they didn't quite know how to get ahold of that 

m oney. [Laughter] So they c harged a lot of 
--
 
a lot of money per head, per pers on, to c om
e in.
 
 
Obvious ly, I s aw the lis t thr ee, four  year s  ago, of the people who applied, her side of the 
family, the parents applied, and they were rejected. And many years  later her  family, members  of her  

family that s ur vived
, 
dis owned her  bec aus e s he saved our
 
s ide
 
--
 
her hus band's  s ide but s he did not 
s ave her  s ide. And we never  knew why. Well, her son found out, by c hance, by c alling England three, 

four year s  ago. He s pok e to the daughter  of the man who saved us . She s aid the r eason s he c ould not 

br ing her parents  out was  bec ause the s is ter  was  an epileptic  and they would not acc ept the s is ter  s o 
the par ents dec ided to stay with the s ister. This woman s uffer ed. She s aved 19 people and s he 
s uffer ed for the r es t of her life. She was  on dr ugs to keep her  going. She was  s o depr es s ed. And she 

never knew that this  happened bec aus e of her s is ter's  illnes s .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But s he was  able to get your  family along with your relative in England
 
--
 
> > J ill Pauly:  We got into Kenya. J une
 
--
 
no. J uly 1939. My father  and the three men who wer e 
impr is oned in Holland wer e alr eady in Kenya. They had gotten us plac es  to s tay.
 
 
It was  terr ibly diffic ult on m y mother.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How many of you in total left Germany?
 

> > J ill Pauly:  Germ any, 12 of us  wer e on the train. In 
Holland, they c ame later . The men, the three 

m en that were inter ned, left fir st.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Got there before you.
 

13
 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Then we left. Then the others
 
--
 
there was  a fam ily of four in Holland, went on the boat 
the day Hitler walked in.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Into Holland. Mm
-
hmm.
 
 
So, your  m other , partic ular ly, and grandpar ents , whic h wer e I think  cruc ial to m aking the 
dec is ions , they m ade all the arr angem ents in Germ any, working with the folks in England. They wer e 
able to pack  up a lot of stuff
 
to move, whic h, of cour s e, never  m ade it. Right?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Right. They had money in the bank . [Laughter ] That's  funny. And the women went out 

and dec ided to buy
 
--
 
I mean, they wer e going to Afr ic a in 1939. They didn't really know wher e they 
were going and what this was  like or wher e they would be living. So they bought all s or ts of things. With 
all the money that was  left in the banks, they gave s om e to the r elatives  that needed it and the rest they 
went out s hopping. And eac h fam ily had a lift. A l
ift is  like a 9
-
by
-
10 r oom full of boxes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Stuff to go to Kenya.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Mm
-
hm m. And thes e wer e s ent to Ham burg, to the port. I think it was  s even lifts . Only 
thr ee or four  ar r ived. The rest didn't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If I remem ber fr
om s om ething you told m e, at that tim e you were allowed to leave and 
take goods with you but you had to pay 100% tax on anything you took  out of the c ountry.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  You had to pay double the tax
 
on
 
everything.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To get out.
 
> > J ill 
Pauly:  On tickets
, o
n anything
 t
hat you took  out of the c ountr y, for Jews  it was  double.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Yet the m ajor ity of it did not mak e it. 
 
> > J ill P auly:  A lot of it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of the ironies  you s hared with m e, when you finally made your way to leave 

Germ any, you made your  way to Italy to board a Germ an s hip. A Germ an s hip was  taking you to 

Kenya.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Fir s t, the 
trip fr om Cologne to Genoa was  s
o dangerous . And the danger was  that we 
would get s epar ated. A big thing for the Germ ans  s eparating fam ilies  and they it well.
 
So m y m other s at 

14
 
 
us  down, as  little as we were. I was 6. She s aid she got
 
--
 
s he got acr os s  that this  was  not for c hildren; 
this  was  an adult thing. We wer e not to m ove on that tr ain.We were not to ask for food, not to go to the 
bathroom , nothing.We wer e to s it still fr om Cologne until we wer e out of the c ountry. And, again, I 
w
anted to know why. I then s tarted to unders tand that we c ould be s epar ated. And I was  terr ified. So I 
was  very good. We didn't move.
 
 
My very sic k grandmother was  in the c om partment with us . When we went over the bor der 
fr om  Germany into Switz er land, I c an
 
promis e you I had never, ever  s een my mother s mile fr om  the 
day I was  bor n. Her fac e was  in a c ons tant state of pain until we c r os s ed that line out of Germany.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Into Switzer land, a neutral c ountry.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  Into Switzer land. Of c ours e, s he knew when we got to Genoa, we wer e getting back on a 
Germ an s hip, whic h was a Nazi s hip, and s he had the two c hildr en, m y grandpar ents, and they wer e 

old. We got on that s hip and s he hears that all the J ews  will be on the lower deck  and the rest of
 
hum anity on the upper  dec k s . And s he r eally got furious . She was so angry. But s he had to put up with 

it.
 
 
We wer e on the s hip. And to m e it was  heaven. You know why?  I was  s un depr ived. I needed 
the energy of the s un. I was  a c hild that was  ins ide all t
he tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had been s o c om pletely protec ted.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Mm
-
hm m. And when I was  happy, I s ang. I was  s inging.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And there's  a s tory there. You have to s har e that.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Mm
-
hm m. Yeah.
 
 
I was  off by mys elf s inging. I don't know what I played with, m aybe a doll. I was  overhear d by 
the Nazi c aptain. I don't know who. He c alled my m other  up and s aid he wanted to know if s he would 

give perm is s ion for me to s ing for the c rew on the s hip.What was  s he going to s ay? 
 
 
There were pr oblem s . I had lear ned the whole Pas s over  his tory, the Haggadah, whic h we 
r ead and s ing once a year  at the 
S adr
. My unc les  had gorgeous  voic es . One of them  was  an oper a 
s inger. And to keep m e bus y, they taught m e the whole Haggadah mus ic. And I
 
s ang Germ an folk 

15
 
 
s ongs.Who k nows  what I was  s inging. I don't know. And the wom en got so frightened bec aus e they 
didn't want m e to s ing Hebrew s ongs.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  To the Nazi the c ompany and his  c r ew.
 
>>
 
J ill Pauly:  Yeah.When I was  6 years  old. They had me up in the c abin, my two grandmothers  and a 
c ouple of the aunts, s inging with they what I s hould s ing and what I s houldn't s ing. I gues s  I made it. I 

thought I did it onc e. But a lady that's still liv ing, who is  98, always  told me, no, 
you 
did it ever y day for  
two weeks . 
 
 
It made them happy, I gues s . And they left us alone. They really didn't bother us on the s hip. 
But for  my mother it was  a ter rible stress bec aus e s he didn't k now if the s hip was  going
 
to take us  to 
Kenya. What did they know? 
 
 
When we got to the har bor  in Mombas a there was  a man in European c lothes  and a Eur opean 
hat and that was  m y father .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Waiting for you in Mom bas a.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Mm
-
hmm. Mm
-
hm m.
 
 
We had a little exper ienc e with m y m other. He had rented a r oom  s omewhere. I don't know 
what it was , a hotel, I don't know, for us to stay the first night and then c ontinue traveling
 b
y train. I was 
s leeping on s omething called a c amp bed, at the foot of the bed. I hear s cream ing. It was  dark  out. My 

m other  was  s cream ing. And we didn't know why. Ther e was  a black m an in a long white gown a
nd a 

hat s erving tea befor e daybr eak. And he fr ightened my mother . She made it a c ondition
 
--
 
I remember 
her  saying "As long as  I'm  in countr y I don't want to be woken up at 6:00
 
in the mor ning for tea." 
Cultur al.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If I r emem ber c orrec tly, one of your gr andfather s or grandparents would not leave the 

s hip for a while bec aus e it was  the Shabbat. Wasn't it?
 
> > J ill P auly:  No, n
o.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  No?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  No. He wouldn't go to Kenya
 u
nles s  he knew ther e was  kosher food on the s hip.
 

16
 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And he was  able to get it. Right? 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  The wom en c alled Ber lin. Ther e was  s ome kind of organization
 t
hat br ou
ght the food to 
the s hip. And ac c or ding to J ewis h law, he didn't have to do that either. I mean, they didn't know what 
laid ahead. They could have done anything. They just didn't know. Nobody knew what the final s olution 
would be.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you
 
arr ived in Kenya, I believe it was  1939, of c ourse, J uly, the war began just a 
c ouple of months  later. In fact, jus t over a m onth later, September
 
1, when Ger many and Rus s ia 
invaded Poland, the start of Wor ld War II. By that time you're in Kenya. So now you're in a c ompletely 

differ ent world. What was  that like for the fam ily? 
 
> > Jill Pauly:  Diffic ult. Difficult in a differ ent way. The pers ec ution c ontinued. My s is ter and I, we were 
under pers ec ution for  12 years . The family was  under per s ec ution for 12 
year s . In Kenya ther e wer e 
laws  per taining to Germ ans , of c our s e, but German Jews , we were Germ an J ews . We always  felt they 

didn't under s tand
. W
hy wer e they doing this ?  We c am e ther e to be liber ated from  fear. And the r eas on 
they didn't under stand it is  bec aus e we didn't know that there were Nazis  s tealing J ewis h identities  and 
s neaking into allied c ountr ies . So they had no way of knowing who was  who. So when the war  br oke 
out, they c am e ar ound and they picked up all the m en in the family and put them in camps . And we 

were left
 
--
 
m y gr andmother  told them  if they took  the gr andfather , s he would have to c ome along. So 
they didn™t
 
take him. They left him.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So in the eyes  of the Br itis h, becaus e you wer e fir st and foremost in their eyes  Germ an 
ther efore you wer e c ons idered enem y aliens .
 
> > J ill Pauly:  We were enem y aliens .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Even though you es c aped there to get away fr om the Nazis .
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Right. And we r em ained enem y aliens  until the end of the war . So the fam ily had eno
ugh 
m oney left for  a downpaym ent on a farm . Nothing els e. They couldn't go for hair c uts after that. Nothing. 

All the m oney you had was  s pent on s aving us. There we wer e on a farm. They locked us up.We wer e 
interned on the farm . We could not leave without per mis s ion. Whenever they left the farm , they had to 

17
 
 
s end a black  m an on a bic yc le to a plac e c alled Kiam bu, where the c omm is s ioner  was , and s ign a 
s tatem ent that they c ould leave the farm  to go s hopping. They didn't go ever y week. They went ever y 

two, thr
ee weeks to Nairobi to s hop.
 
 
Now, I don't k now if my sis ter  and I needed anything bec aus e we had to go to s c hool. They 
didn't interfere in that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you had to go to Englis h s c hool.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Br itis h s c hools . We went to Britis h boarding s c hools . We did not boar d in the schools  

bec aus e my mother wouldn't let us go wher e there was  no kos her food. So we lived with fam ilies  that 

were c los e to the s c hools . They wer e ver y diffic ult s c hools, very, ver y diffic ult s c hools. The Britis h 
educati
on was  tough. And the teac her s were mean
, v
er y m ean.
 
 
I lear ned later that thos e teac hers were plac ed there agains t their  will. They r eally didn't do 
this  voluntarily. They wer e plac ed ther e by the gover nm ent and they didn't like it. So they had to let it 
out s omewhere.What?  A little J ewis h gir l?  You c an pick on her anytime.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I was  struc k  when you told me that almos t right away there you are in Englis h
-
s peaking 
s c hool, of c our s e you don't s peak Englis h, and they're demanding that you s ing
 
"God 
S
ave the 
K

> > J ill P auly:  Mm
-
hm m.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you learnedWor ds worth, "The 
D
affodils ," and had to r ec ite that. Your educ ation 
had to c ome very quickly.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Very quickly. We lived in a big house in Nairobi for s ix weeks . My father put us  into 
s c hool
 
the
 
first day we got ther e.
 
The tr adition was  that the black  young men would c ar ry our lunc h 
boxes  and walk us  to s chool. Now, this  is with a mother  c om ing out of Nazi Ger m any, ok ?  We had to 
go to s c hool. So thes e two young men took  us . It was  about a 25, 20, 25
-
m inute walk through the 
woods, over a water , you know, where you had to take your  s hoes  and s ocks off to c r oss  over it, the 

s c hool.We didn't k now any language. We didn't k now Swahili. We didn't k now Englis h. They c ertainl
y 
didn't know German. Within s ix weeks  we understand the language.We unders tood the Swahili. We 

18
 
 
were s peaking with them. Englis h was  a little longer , three months. The teac hers  wer e m er c iles s, 
abs olutely m erc iles s .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And during that tim e, Jill, of c ourse the Br itis h that wer e there, the m en wer e, of 
c our se, going off to fight, joining the Arm y, having to leave their  enterpr is es , their farm s and ranc hes  
that they had been running. So that's when they tur ned to the inter ned men. Tell us what happened to 

the m en.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  The m en cam e out of internm ent a week after they wer e put in bec aus e we had the farm, 

bec aus e we had put a downpaym ent on the farm. Other men c ouldn't leave until they had jobs . They 

plac ed them  far away from  Nair obi. We
 
were 20
 
m iles  fr om Nair obi, whic h was n't s o far.
 
I'm los ing m y tr ack. Where was  I?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Desc ribing that the men now had to manage the Jewis h far m s.
 

> > Jill Pauly:  Yeah. The m en, the refugees, wer e as s igned res pons ibilities  to go to Br itish far ms and 

help the wom en run those far m s as their jobs  as sec ondary jobs. And m y father did that for the duration 

of the war, and s ever al of the other m en did it. It worked out because these people needed us  and they 
were c los e by. That was  it.
 
> > Bill B ens o
n:  You wer e her e with us  a c ouple of years  ago with your s is ter , Inge
, 
 
and I think Inge 
m ight have m entioned this . You had a c landes tined r adio at your hous e. Tell us  about that.
 
> > J ill P auly:  We had a
 
--
 
it was n't c landestine. It was  jus t a r adio. It ran on batteries . And my unc les  
didn't want those batter ies  us ed bec aus e you c ouldn't get new ones  s o quic kly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you only lis tened to what was  going on in the war  at that tim e.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yes . And we were r eally living in the most pr im itive c onditions  you c an im agine. They 
found a c inder block  house with windows  that had fr am es  but no glas s. It was  jus t ver y pr imitive. But it 

was  c inder bloc k with a tin r oof. They worked on it for  about a month, with a lot of help, and it was  a nic e 

ho
m e. We c alled it hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I k now we'r e m oving for war d bec aus e of tim e, Jill. Of c our s e, you would go thr ough 
one m ore m ajor upheaval, I think , in 1947, just before the upris ing.

> > J ill P auly:  No.We left.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I was  going to s ay, you left right befor e.What pr om pted you to leave Kenya and how 

did you m ake it to the United States ?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  My father  was  not happy with the politic al behavior  of the Br itis h. They wer e very c ruel 

to the indigenous  black  people. And my father always  told us , ac c or ding to the Tor ah, that that was  

forbidden
; 
you c an't do that. He s aid, 
ﬁ
I don't want m y daughters  growing up in this s oc iety. I'm getting 
out. We'r e leaving the day the war  is  over.
ﬂ  
Well, we c ouldn't get out the day the war  was  over 
becaus e 
we didn't have people in the United States  who c ould s pons or us . That took  another c ouple of year s .
 
We left in 
`
47 in 
`
52 they los t the farm . They s till had the far m. Financ ially they los t the farm, again. 
Bec aus e of the

beginning in a c ountry.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you s tarted all over again.

Right.

s alutator ian. 

I don't know if I opened a book.
 
I s at on a benc h, went home. I was  way ahead. But then things  star ted 
c hanging when I went to high sc hool.

gotten us ed to not working. And I s tar ted m aking new friends. It was  ver y, ver y diffic ult for me. There 

was  one thing in this  wor ld that I was  jealous  of, nothing els e, ever, was  the c omfort level of the kids  

ar ound m e: 
t
hem gr owing up together , knowing eac h other
, t
he way it is  in Am er ic a. It was n't like that 
for m e. I was  r em oved from  family and fr iends  and went to s c hools  with kids  who were not partic ular ly 

20
 
 
m y c up of tea. So I had to star t from s cratc h at 14. They had already had 14 years  before me in

to ask  J ill s ome questions  but when Jill finis hes , we'r e

J ill's  going to r em ain her e with us  on the s tage. 
So i
f  
anybody would like to c om e up and ask her a ques tion or  just, you know, s hake her hand or take a 
photogr aph, whatever  you want to do pleas e feel free to do that when we c los e.
 
 
You m entioned to m e that the Fourth of J uly
 
--
 
in the past you've mentioned the Fourth of J uly 
has  s pec ial s ignific anc e for you. Of c our s e, we just 
c elebr ated the
 
Fourth
. Why is it s o s pec ial for you? 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Love of c ountr y and love of patriotis m. I heard a radio program  on the Fourth of J uly 
wher e a young man who won the m edal of honor s poke. And he s poke about his  back gr ound and his  

life. 
I believe he was  fr om  either Iowa or  Idaho. I r em ember c learly him  s aying that he was n't a ver y 
good s tudent in s c hool but when he was  a junior, in c hem is tr y c las s , 9/11 happened. They had a TV in 

the r oom. They s aw a plane fly into a building and they thought it was  s ome nut, you know, who los t his 

way and flew into the building. But then very quickly they s aw that it was  two huge planes  and that it 
was  ter rorism. He goes  hom e and he tells  his  m other  that he's found his  voc ation in life; he wants  to 

21
 
 
join the militar y r ight away. And s he s aid, no, you have to finis h high s c hool and then you c an join the 
m ilitary. He talk s  about fighting and going into plac es  where you have to shoot back  and how he 

learned that what he was  fighting for was  not to go out and kill people. You kill people bec aus e they 
attack  you. And he was  going out to fight to keep what we have. And I was  s o im pr es sed. And s o happy 
to be living here. It's  s uch a privilege.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It's our tradition that our
 
First Pers on
 
has  the las t w
or d so I'm going to tur n back  to J ill 
to give us  her last word.
 
When s he's  finis hed, our photograph, J oel, will c om e up on stage, take 
a  
photogr aph of J ill with you as  the backdrop
,  
s o I will as k that you all s tand at that time. Then as I 
m entioned, J ill will s tay her e on the s tage so pleas e feel fr ee to c ome up and c hat with her .
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being her e. I r em ind you that we will have
 
Firs t Per s on
 
pr ogr am s 
eac h Wednes day and Thur s day until the m iddle of Augus t. The mus eum's  webs ite provides  inform ation 
about eac h upc oming
 
Firs t Per s on
 
guest and, of cours e, we'll have inform ation about our pr ogr am  in 
2017.
 
 
So with that J ill, c los e our  program .
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Ok . I think I jus t c los ed the progr am. I s poke about the young m an who won the Medal of 

H
onor  and what a privilege it is to have people lik e that
 a
ll over  this  c ountry, young men who go off to 
fight in other c ountries to tr y to m aintain what we have at hom e. It is  s o prec ious . Maybe you have to be 

a natur alized c itizen and go through
 
the har d times  of bec om ing an American. It's  not eas y. I don't k now 
anybody who jus t gets  off the boat and bec om es  an Amer ic an. It's a proc es s . It's a ver y, ver y diffic ult 
pr oc es s
; c
ultur ally, financ ially, s oc ially. It's  diffic ult. It takes a long tim e. But it's  all worth it. 
 
 
We didn't do a thing or  have a thing happen to us that has n't been r ewarding. My hus band is  
her e. He was  in the for c es  dur ing the Kor ean c onflic t.We adopted c hildren in the United States .
 
When I 
c am e to this  c ountr y I was  13, not quite 14, got mar ried at 24. So I was  only her e 10 year s. And within a 
few year s  I adopted Americ an babies  that needed to be provided for. Otherwis e they didn't give you the 

babies . 
 

22
 
 
 
So I don't think  that a natur al bor n Am er ic an c an ever  unders tand what they have her e. Mos t 
of the people that c ome here, 99%, are r unning away fr om s om ething. They are c oming to Am erica to 
live bec aus e they want a better life and they fight for this  life, to maintain it. So the s peec h yes terday 
that I hear d really s ort of galv
anized what I feel.
 
 
With that, I thank  you for c oming and lis tening.
