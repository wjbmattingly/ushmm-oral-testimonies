Question: Joan Schwab inte
rview tape number 1, Novemb
er 5, 1996, Billian Cline, 
interviewer. Tell me about you home
 life before Hitler came to power. 
 
Answer: We lived in an apartm
ent in the tea garden area, 
and I remember some of the 
lovely art pieces we had, which I loved very
 much and we went to
 a private schoolmy 
twin brother and I with another 
girlso there was only three of us going to a private teacher 
from age six to ten. And th
en we went to an other pr
ivate school which was mixed 
Christians and Jewish. I think 
we were only there for about a 
year, and then  we moved to 
a Jewish school in (?Altmorebeat?) I believe
 it's now called the An ne Frank School in 
that area because we visited it a few years ago. 
 
Q: Tell me about your experiences at home a
nd with respect to your Jewish community 
or Judaism? 
 
A: We belonged to a co ngregation called Adas
 Israel, and we went to synagogue every 
Saturday  mo rning, an d of course we kept th
e high holidays. I knew 
that my mother came 
from BÃ¼dingen, and from parents who were no
t in the least religious, and in fact my 
grandfather, who moved in with  us in 1936 
wh en things started getting difficult for Jews 
in small areas in Germany, he always said 
I fought for the Kaiser and I'm German and I'm 
going to I've been born in Germany, I'm going to
 die in Germany, of course, he didn't he 
died in th e concen tration camp  
in Theresienstadt, but he move
d in  with us in '36 and so 
did my  uncle. 
 
 
Q: Did your grandfather object to the degree 
observance in your hous
e as compared to his 
home?  
 
A: No, he didn't object, and I think he and my  
uncle, his son, who move
d in with us at the 
same time would go out and ea
t ham and pork, wh ich we didn't have in the home. We 
had a kosher household. It was a little diffi
cult having th em come an
d live with us in a 
small apartment, but they had 
nowhere else to go because 
they 're shop was taken away. 
And then they started helping my father in 
his four leather shops, and that was a great 
help having family to run th ese different shop
s. It was not a leather shop in th e way you 
think of it in the United States. It was a (?shum
ahe bedafsaticel?) And th at is to say things 
that a shoe maker would buy to  repair his 
shoes. And it was a growing concern and it was 
called Rishad Brant, and in  very , very sma
ll letters under Rishad Bran t would be written 
Israel Nusboum, owner, so that peopl
e would notice it was a Jewish name. 
 
Q: You observed the holidays at home? 
 

A: Yes, we observed the holiday s, and I re
memb er one of my  favorite ones was Sukkot, 
and we walked through the synagogue, an
d there was one man who was a butcher who 
always gave us sausages for our collection, a nd th at was a particular
ly grand day, and we 

really enjoyed that. But he 
fasted on Yom Kippur, and that
 was very important, and my  
brother was Bar Mitzvah in 
1938, but by th at time we ha
d all thought of emigrating 
already because things were ge
tting wo rse and wo rse. And we 
children were told never to 
hit back anybody who would ca
ll us Jew on th e street or wh
o would attack us. And this 
was sort of intimidating for a youngster. We we
re not allowed to go to the movies, but we 

had a cleaning woman, a Chri
stian cleaning wo man who, ve
ry sweetly, would take us 
with her daughter to see some Shirley Te
mple films; so that was very exciting.
 
Otherwise my  parents played cards, and my  
mother helped also 
in the shop, and I 
reme mb er a very happy childhood with cousin
s visiting, and I think Berlin was better to 

live in as a Jew than than 
small places in Germany. I do 
remember one experience where 
we went towe went to a big fest, Unter 
Den Linden, and Hitler 
and his cohorts came by 
on th e street, and they were policemen on hor
ses. We thought, well, we ought see this 
man who's making such  a difference in our liv
es, and low and behold
, one of the horses 
kicked my mother, and the po
lice were very solicitous and 
wanted  to know our names so 
that they could, I guess, give us some sort 
of help, and we were very anxious not to tell 
them that our name was Nusboum, and my  mo
ther looked just like a Christian woman. 
She had blue eyes and bl
ond hair so I guess they didn't re
alize they we were Jewish, but I 
reme mb er we didn't tell our name or anything 
we said, "No. It's perfectly all right. Don't 
worry about it."  I do remember that it was sort of scary. 
 
Q: That's v ery interesting. Tell me, what was yo
ur first experience of Nazi rise to power?  
I know you were a child, bu
t what can you recollect?  
 
A: I remember our family ta
lking about it and that we we
re scared, but we always 
thought it would pass, that the 
Germans would realize that H
itler really was no good, and 
that things would be well again. Somehow one
 never anticipated the degree to which this 
(?youden fu fulg en?) would go. So that we
 did think of going ot
her seas and made 
preparations for it to go illegally because we
 didn't have anyone
 to sponsor us. But 
somehow we always relented at the last min u
te and decided to stay. It was really only 
Kristallnacht that repelled us to th
ink serously of leaving Germany. 
 
Q: What was your ex perience of Kris
tallnacht or wh at did you hear?  
 
A: Well, it was interesting. We had a sudd
en telephone call from 
my  16yearold cousin 
who was wo rking in  Berlin, and she told us 
that "Uncle Iz" as she called himmy father 
whose name was Israel. Should go for a walk, a
nd of course we immediately realized that 
somehow he shouldn't be home so he went ov
er and stayed with his sister because we 
knew the Gestapo didn't look in  women's houses.
 They only looked 
in families. They  

didn't  look at women's houses. My uncle went
 to his girlfriend's house. My grandfather 
stayed home because he was 72 already. And 
my brother of course
 was only 12; so we 
didn't  think that that was dangerous. We had 
a visit from our janitor's wife who asked us 
whether father was in, and we said no he wa
sn't, and I don't really know why she visited 
whether she visited with a view to telling hi
m to go out or whether th e Gestapo had sent 
her on an advance to make sure that he was 
there, but in any event we were lucky. He 
was gone, and ab out ten minutes later two 
black leather coated men came up and asked 
for my father. We said he had gone out, and 
they very politely aske
d to look through the 
apartment to make sure; and we said, "Sure go
 right ahead."  And of
 course he was gone, 
and they  saw my  grandfather sleeping there 
and asked how old he wa
s, and we told him 
72, and after they left, I remember my mo
ther saying sh e was shaking all over, poor 
thing. And of course us childre
n we didn't realize the import 
of it all. But it was from that 
day onward that we did thinkof getting out of the country. 
 
Q: What steps did you take 
to leave the country then?  
 
A: It's so happened that at our Jewish sch
ool, there were some forms being passed around 
where a secondary school in Lo
ndon had gotten togeth er with 
a parentteacher association, 
and they  had decided to bri
ng to England three children: 
 One from Austria, one from 
Czechoslo vakia, and one from Germany, in fact
 three girls because it was a girl's  school, 
and since my  parents said, well really should 
try to get out, I completed the form, and it 

was sent back to England. And I was very lu
cky to be chosen  the German girl to go to  
England to school. So in Ma y 21--I shan't never forget it 
of course--we went to the 
railroad station, and off I went with the child
ren's transport. It was a dreadful experience 

because there was a Polish woman on the pl
atform who was being dragged away by 
Gestapo men by her hair, and she was screaming,
 and we didn't really know whether we'd  
all by arrested before we left. So it was very 
awful in leaving my pare
nts really not with a 
view that I wouldn't see them
 again because I never thought 
that would happen. But it's a 
new experience to go a countr
y with another lang
uage, and I remember I had a little gold 
ring and in the compartment, 
the train compartment, so mebod
y mentioned that, "oh, we 
shouldn't have any jewelry with us."  And 
I reme mb er going to  the toilet and hiding th is 
little gold ring, and after we got to Holland, 
I picked it up again. I think it was in the 
garbage can, something like that. But it was--we were very ha
ppy wh en we left Germany. 
It was like we could sudden ly breathe freely,
 and there was some people in the railroad 
station that brought us cookies and crackers 
and welcomed us with juices. And it was like 

being in another wo rld, and it's
 very odd, but after I left 
Germany, I started growing and 
getting bigger. I used to be a really thin 
little thing, and I guess being in a free country 
makes you think and eat differently, 
and I became a normal 13yearold. 
 
Q: Tell me, you say your parent
s were planing to emigrate. 
Had they made any attempts 
to emigrate as a family ?  
 

A: Only illegal attemp ts. My father was very s
cared that at the last
 minute at the border 
we would be caught, and of cour
se that would be wo rse than not going out at all. So wh en 
I left, one of the things my  parents had tried to
 get us out, which I did tried to do and I did 
manage to get my  twin brother out, but unf
ortunately the war broke out, and I could not 
get my  parents out, and they perished in Au schwitz. 
 
Q: On Kristallnacht, when your
 father was fortunate enough
 to leave the house, do you 
know of any other me n who were not so we
ll prepared, and what happened to  those? 
 
A: Yes, I remember ab out six weeks after Kr
istallnacht, my  father's brother who was a 
teacher in Dortmund came back
 from concentration camp, a
nd he had frostbitten fingers 
and toes, and he looked absolu tely dreadful. 
He had been  in a concentration camp . And 
then my English teacher came back from concentration cam
p and his teeth, his front 
teeth, had been smashed in. And it was a very
 dreadful experience fo r us because as 
children you grow up trusting, 
trusting your parents, trusti
ng the system, and all of a 
sudden you realize that you'
re on the outside looking in, 
and things won't get better. 
 
Q: These men came back from concentration camp? 
 
A: Well, as far as I can remember, I guess th
e Germans were not re
ady yet to keep men 
on a permanent basis; so that th
ey let them g o  after about si
x weeks, and then they fined 
all Jews for the murder of Vom Rath, and we a
ll had to give up part of our silver and pay 
money to  comp ensate the Germans for having
 lost Vom Rath whic
h was the excuse, of 
course. And even tually, of course, they did 
get concentration camps ready, but at that 
time they didn't have sufficient facilities to 
keep people. And I th
ink they w
ould have 
been very happy to let all th
e Jews go out of the country , 
because but of course they 
weren't allo wed to take their money with th
em anyway , so they would have kept the 
money and got rid of the Jews. 
 
Q: They would have been happy to get the 
Jews go, but th e Jews 
weren 't ready to go 
then?  
 
A: No. I think the Jews were ready to go, bu
t they didn't  want to
 go without any money, 
which is what they would have 
had to do. My father lost hi
s four stores. They were all 
broken in to, and things were stolen, and after 
that he didn't have any wo rk an ymore. So it 
was living on your inco me, what
ever you had, but not making
 any mo re money. So  it was 
a matter of really thinking we have to get out
 of here. But it was ea
sier said than done. 
 
Q: What was your ex perience as a Jew in th
e non Jewish community before Hitler and 
then after Hitler came aboutcame to power. Wa
s there any change in the attitude of your 
friends and neighbors?  
 
A: We really didn't have Christian friends be
cause of the school we went to with the 
other little girl was Jewish also, and ju st like 
in any big so ciety in 
an apartment life, you 

don't really have neig hbors with  whom you 
associate. So I can really say because we 
were all in Jewish circles. 
 
Q: Was there any change among the people that
 you weren't necessar
ily friendly with, but 
neighbors?  Did you discern increased hostility?  
 
A: No. We lived our liv
es completely apart, but we were
 very careful not to give any 
neighbors cause to criticize us. I remember ve
ry clearly listening to the BBC and foreign 
broadcasts, and our parents al
ways while they were listeni
ng, had us gomy 
brother went 
to one door, and I went to the other to ma
ke sure the noise wasn 't penetrating the 
apartment so thatbecause you could get arrested
 for listening to foreign news services. 
 
Q: On your train ride out 
of Germany and toward Engl
and, tell me how were you 
provided for?  Did you ta
ke food along with you? 
 
A: I don't really remember whether we took
 food along, but we did get fed when we 
crossed the Dutch border, and we 
were also fed on the ship be
fore we arrived in England. 
And I shall never forget that because we had 
white bread, which I ha
d never seen before 
and co rnflak es, which was another thing th at 
was new in my  life, not having eaten cereals 
in Germany. And th en by train we were take
n to London to a hallI guess it mu st have 
been in th e railroad station, and names were 
called of children, and various people picked  
them up and when my name came, there was 
a young blonde girl 
by name of Yolanda 
who came and picked  me up, and 
she explained to me that sh
e was the ward of the head 
mistress of the school who had really been
 very mu ch ah ead of her timesingle woman 
who had adopted a German, a Czech, and anAustrian child. And the German teacher had 
paid for my school ed ucation, wh ich I didn't
 find out until the ve
ry end. Anyway , I'm 
proceeding myself. We went to the home of 
a Norman and Elsie Denim where I was to 
live. They had a daughter about 
my  age who went to the same school and a son four years 

older, and Yolanda spoke a little 
bit of German to me, and th
is was when she got to the 
house, she said, "Well, that's  the last time I'
ll be speaking German 
with you."  And I was 
sort of scared because I di
dn 't speak very much Englis
h. But everyb
ody was very 
welcoming. And I do rememb er that we had 
tea, and everybody sat around th e table, all 
these new people chattering in English, 
and th ere was something that looked like 
chocolate paste, and I asked the young boy by
 name of Hue wh at it was, and he spoke a 
little German so he explained to me that it was 
chocolate the (?retch?)  It turned out to be 
Marmite an d very spicy, and I learned very soon
 to take very little of it. And then I went 
upstairs and cried. I went into the bathroom a
nd cried, and after that I guess I decided this 
was my new life, and I was going to have to
 accommodate to it. And people were very, 
very kind. I'm still in touch wi
th Marry, my foster sister, and 
Hue, my foster brother. We 
visit each other's homes, and we
'v e been very close friends. 
 
Q: Were you able to contact yo
ur parents during this period?  
 

A: I wrote to my  parents on a regular basis, 
and th ey an swered, and Auntie Elsie took me 
to a Jewish language school every Sunday, wh
ich was a big sacrifice for her because they 
were very devout Plymouth Brethren Ch ris
tians, and so sh e missed the Su nday mo rning 
service taking me to Hebrew class. 
 
Q: What were you permitted to 
bring on your trip to Lond
on when  you left home?  
 
A: Well, I remember I was allowed to carry on
e suitcase, which of course we each had to 
carry ourselves, and I remember 
my  mo ther buying me some nice clothing to take along, 
all of which turned out to be
 comp letely unsuitable because we wore uniforms to school. 
And as soon as I got to London, friends of
 Marry's would contribute school uniforms for 
me to wear, and as I said, I grew too quickly 
after that that in no time flat I had out gown 
all my beautiful clothes. I remember that wh
en I was evacuated to Chichester after the 
war had started, Auntie Elsie sold my  cl
othes, and all I got from these beautiful 
garmentswhich actually I think I never wore
 ag ainwere three pairs of black woollen 
stockings which I detested but wh ich were part
 of our school uniform and I had to wear. 
And I guess I've always rememb ered it beca
use I was so unhappy ab
out losing all these 
beautiful things. Bu t makes sense;
 they didn't f
it me anymore. 
 
Q: How did you feel?  You were from obvi
ously from a welltodo fa
mily, and suddenly 
you're taking handmedowns from other famili
es. You were an impoverished child. How 
did that affect you? 
 
A: Well, it didn't  bother me 
too much. Everybody was so ki
nd, and it bothered me a little 
bit about the clothes as I said, but generally
 sp eaking, I was feeling so liberated and 
wonderful to be out of this 
scary atmosphere where you c
ouldn't say wh at you thought, 
and all of a sudden I could say whatever I 
felt like, and when I saw a policeman and I 

cringed, Auntie Elsie would say, "You don't ha
ve to be afraid of 'our Bobbies'," which 
they were called in England. "They will always
 be there to help y
ou."  And it was such a 
wonderful feeling to be free, really free. 
 
Q: How did you feel about 
being Jewish in an essen
tially Christian community? 
 
A: I didn't worry about it at a
ll because everybody was so very 
kind to me that I just felt I 
was one of the people, and 
nobody ever asked me was I 
Jewish. Nobody treated me 
differently because I was Jewish. And as ch
ildren will, they take for granted that 
whatever happens to them is the right
 thing, so I had no worry about that. 
 
Q: Tell me more please about your expe
rience in the Jewi
sh Sunday school. 
 
A: Well, we walked across the common every 
Su nday  mo rning, and I went to Hebrew 
class, and having been  told by my  parents th
at I really should try and get our family out 
of Germany, I approached th
e head rabbi who was teaching 
us one Sunday morning and 
asked him if they could not find a home for my  
brother. And he looked at me and he said, 

"Oh. You're the little girl who 
lives with nonJewish people." 
 And I said, "Yes, I am."  
And he said, "Well, until you move to a Jewi
sh family, there's nothi
ng we can do."  So I 
said to him, "But if I move to a Jewish fami
ly, I'm already taking away the place that my  
brother could take."  
And he said, "No, no there's nothi
ng we can do until you move to a 
Jewish family."  So I left 
Sunday school very depressed 
and very unhappy and started 
crying on the way home, and Auntie Elsie sa
id to me, "What's the matter?  Why are you 
crying?"  And I told  her about the incident
, and it was Auntie Elsie and Uncle Norman 
who decided to adopt my  brother who then
 came to England at the beginning of 

August 1939 and started to process papers fo
r my parents to come over, but unfortunately 
due to th e war breaking out in 
September, they never made it. 
 
Q: How did you feel telling Auntie Elsi
e what the rabbi had said to you? 
 
A: I was very ashamed that a Jewish person 
would do a thing like th
at. I'm still ashamed. 
 
Q: How did that effect your 
feelings towards Judaism?  
 
A: Well, that's an interesting question be
cause inat the outbreak of war, we werethe 
children that is to sayall of the school were al
l evacuated to Chichest
er, a small, very old 
town  in the south of Engla
nd. And there was no Jews in 
Chichester. My Uncle Norman 
wrote to my father through th
e Red Cross asking wh ether it would be all right for Hans, 
my  brother, and my self to go to  church, and 
my  father wrote back  and said that his 
children were old enough to  know what was right, 
and that if he felt that since there was 

no Jewish house of worship, we
 should go to Sunday schoolth
at he should feel very free 
to send us. 
 
Q: Did Uncle Norman want to co nvert you?  
 
A: No. Not at all. Which is 
why theyUncle Norman was a cu
stoms official in the British 
Civil Service, but he was interested in relig
ion and had studied relig
ion theo logy, and in  
fact he was a doctor of theology wh ich he ne
ver, never talked about. But that was why he 
was interested in Jews and Judaism because
, of course, he understood the connection 
between the Old and 
the New Testament. 
 
Q: What was Auntie Elsie's attitu de toward you as a Jew?  
 
A: Auntie Elsie treated me not as a Jew, but
 as another child in 
the home. She endeared 
herself to me because I had brought a doll to
 England, and during th
e transport its eyes 
had fallen out, and sh e took me to a doll hosp
ital and had the eyes put back in. And th e 
doll meant very much to me. 
It was the only cuddly th ing, and the family was not a 
cuddly family so that all of a sudden phys
ical contact was gone. I guess as Jews or 
Germans, perhaps we were more physically
 effusive certainly 
my family was with 
hugging each other which the 
Denim family never did. 
 

Q: Did your brother fit in
to the family there?  
 
A: Well, he fitted in very well because he ha
d Hue as a companion, 
and of course, he was 
only there for about three weeks because at
 the beginning of September, we were 
evacuated to Chichester. 
 
Q: How did you adap t to the new school especially in a language you didn't understand?  
 
A: It was difficult the first two or three days
, but being thrown in to
 an Englishspeaking 
household and going to an En
glishspeaking school, I ende
d up ju st like Yolanda. In no 
time flat I wasn't speaking German anymore,
 only English, and I'm 
a little bit ashamed of 
myself because when I 
picked up my brother at the railr
oad station, I im
itated Yolanda 
when we got home and I said, "That's the la
st time I've spoken  any German to you, 
Hans."  
 
Q: As I rememb er you were very angr
y wh en Yo landa did that to you. 
 
A: Yes. I'm afraid so. 
 
Q: Was how long was it between the time you a
rrived London or in 
England and Hans?  
 
A: It was about two months, and I reme mb er
 that it was difficult at school, but I was 
placed into a lower class so 
that I had less difficulty catch
ing up, and the children were 
very kind. Occasionally they 
would tease me, and I remember
 one of them calling me 
fish face. A nd I went home, and I asked Uncl
e Norman, "What's fish face?"  And he said, 
"Well, it's nothing very  bad, but next time you 
see the girl who said th
is to you, you just 
call her dog's  body."  
 
Q: What subjects were your favorite in school? 
 
A: I would say English was my  
favorite, and geography I loved,
 and art. I loved drawing. 
 
Q: And the sciences?  
 
A: Well, I was never too good 
at the sciences I'm afraid . 
 
Q: How about your brother? 
 
A: My brother's strength was ma
thematics, but of course, since he came in August, he 
never went to school in London. He started 
going to school in Chichester after we were 
evacuated. 
 
Q: How did you find the level of educatio
n in England comp ared to what you had 
experienced in Germany?  
 
A: I would say it was about on the same level. 
 
Q: Same amount of homework  and 
numb er of hours in school?  
 

A: Yes. I would say it was very ____+ ye
s. I would say it was very comp arable. 
 
Q: Tell me about your experience in Ch
ichesteryour home life and schooling. 
 
A: It's a long story really because it was my 
main life in England. I was in Chichester 
from just before the war starte
d until 1944. I went to high school there, and I graduated 
from high school, and at that point the school
 went back  to Lond
on. By brother and I 
were locatedbilitted was the word--in a sm
all home where a very old lady and her 
middleaged daughter lived. Her middleaged da
ughter was working, but it was really no 
environment for a teenage boy and girl so that 
within a very short period of time, we were 

reassigned separately, my  brother to one house
hold and I to another. And he stayed in th e 
household he was in and was 
very happy, went to public
 school, and went back to 
London in 1944 
also. I on the other hand was with 
a family where th
e woman actually 
had a nerv ous breakdown after I got there. I 
kept hoping it wasn't me
, and I don't think it 
was, but one of her neig hbors who was a dear 
lady took me into her house. She had three 
other evacuees, and we all slep
t in one double bed, and ther
e was a dog who scared me to 
death. I had never had experien
ce of a dog, and the first thin
g this dog did was to upset a 
hot cup of chocolate over my  la
p, but we got to like each 
other very  mu ch even tually. 
 
Q: Your were three, four girls in one double bed?  
 
A: Yes. We were four girls in one double 
bed, and we had a shower every two weeks, 
and it was a matter of putting money in the (?
giza?) to get hot water in the bathroom 
where was really the only place you could get 
hot water. And we would take turns in 
being first, second, th ird, four
th in the bathtub. And it was so
 cold that first winter. I was 
not used to just having a fi
replace in the living room and 
no other place in the house not 
heated because in Berlin, we had had centr
al heating, and we had hot water in the 
bathroom. Here we had no hot water and wo rs
t of all, the toilet was outside the house. 
 
Q: Was this a poor family? 
 
A: I would say it was a lower middle class fam
ily. But they were love
ly people. The lady 
whom I called Auntie Nell, she had been edu
cated age until 14; so 
she didn't have too 
mu ch education, she could barely write. He
r husband was a fishmonger and eventually 
was called up in to the police. Thethe other child
ren went back to Lon
don after this falseI 
forget what it was called, but in the first 
winter, there was no air raids so the children 
some of them did drift back 
to London. I stayed 
with Auntie Nell, and when  her husband 
was called up, she an d I grew very  close. Sh
e had no children, and I had no mo ther; so 
she was very protective of me. They had ve
ry little money, but I 
remember one birthday 
she gave me a bicycle which enabled me to ri
de to schoolwhich I had to do twice a day 
because we came home for lunchinstead of wa
lking the two miles which was a long way 
to walk. She was a lovely person. I'm still in 
touch with her. She's ju st entered an old age 
home in Chichester. 
 

Q: You say that the other children went ba
ck  to London; so did you have a bed to 
yourself?  
 
A: Well, actually what we did was she and I sl
ept in this double bed, and the other room 
was rented out to another person to make a 
little mo re money becaus
e they really didn't 
have very mu ch money. There was one 
man whoMr. Watts, who came every summer and 
stayed with her while he wa
s selling his ice cream, and I reme mb er Mr. Watts coming to 
the house and saying, "I want to stay w
ith you this summer," and Auntie Nell said, 
"You're welcome."  And he sa
id, "What's this little girl doi
ng here?  Is she German?"  
And Auntie Nell said, "Yes, she'
s German."  And he said, "The
n I don't want to stay with 
you."  And she said, "That's pe
rfectly all right. The little girl
 is going to stay with me 
whether you stay or not."  He finally relented
 and decided to stay there; so between bein g 
German and Jewish, it wa
s hard road to plow. 
 
Q: Was Auntie Nell a devout Christian, and 
did shew hat was her feelings about you're 
being Jewish? 
 
A: No. She wasn't a devout Ch ristian, but 
like mo st uneducated people, they  felt Jews 
were different. Now of course, since I lived with
 her for so long, she re
alized that I wasn't 
different, but in the beginning I had a diary 
which I locked. It had a lock on it, and I 
would write in there when I was unhappy, 
and one day I came home and she had broken 
the lock on the diary and read
 my  diary wh ich then made me never write in the diary 
again. Bu t I didn't hold it against her because she really was very kind. It made me 

unhappy for a little while. 
 
Q: What was it that she read in
 the diary?  Was it anything th at effected your relationship 
to w a rd  h e r? 
 
A: No, it wasn 't because 
it was still in German. 
 
Q: I see. Are there any experiences while you 
lived in Chichester th
at are particularly 
memo rable to you? 
 
A: Well, there are several. One was that due 
to the fact that we had only cold water to 
wash with and no bathroom, I 
took a catlick in the kitchen 
in the morning, and one day 
my schoolteacher said to me, "Inga, yo
u 've got a dirty neck," which was very 
embarrassing and humiliating,
 and after that I even managed 
to wash my ne
ck with cold 
water. That was one experience.
 Another one was went I was bicycling home from school 
there was a German airplane very, very low 
in the sky, and I felt sure it was going toto 
machine gun me, and so I dashed  off the bicy cle and into a doorway 
and of course that 
this (?hagencoits?) the swastik
a still frightened me so much. 
 
Q: What happened to  the plane?  
 

A: I don't really know. It might have crashed.
 We did have an air force base not too far 
from us called Tangmere, and it could be that 
the German plane was 
looking for this air 
force base to bomb. 
 
Q: Back to Sunday school. Any incidents or 
stories you want to tell me about going to 
Sunday school and going to  church? 
 
A: I sort of resented going to Sunday school
 at church, and there was a dear old man who 
was in charge of Sunday school, and when ev er
 he called on me with a question, he would 
say, "My ch ild of Aberham."  He always ca
lled me his child of Aberham. And I would 
argue with him fiercely because I was very 
well acquainted with the Old Testament, of 
course not with the New, but it was something 
which came to mean  a lot to me, and I got 
to the point where one night I dreamt about 
Jesus Christ, and I felt that, yes, I was 
converted, and it made me very happy. Jesus 
Christ to me was someone I could talk to 
anywhere, not just in church . I would be in th
e bathroom, and I could talk to him or in the 
kitchen or in my  bed, and so mehow I remember
 Yahova as being a very
 strict god, a god 
who was jealous of his prerogatives and to 
me, I guess Jesus was more of a friend and 
father which I did not have. 
 
Q: Any other experiences at Chichester?  
 
A: Yes. Chichester was a wonderful place to
 grow up in. It was a small city and our 
stratum secondary school was ho
used in the Chichester High 
School building, and we had 
some rooms that we worked 
in, and Chichester High School
 had some rooms that they 
worked in. The teachers 
lived near the school and looked
 after us in many ways other 
than at school, and when we were 16 years 
old, we were called before a counsel in 
Tunbridge Wells and asked wh ether we woul
d give away  any secrets to Germans who 
would promise us that our 
parents would be saved. 
 
Q: Who is this "we"?  
 
A: We is my brother and my self, and so we sa
id of course we wouldn't. Of course I never 
really knew what secrets we could possibly 
have known at age 16 to give away  to 
anybody. 
 
Q: Do you feel that the En
glish were still very skeptic
al of you as Germans?  
 
A: I think that they were not too skeptical
 of us because we didn't speak German 
anymore. Ou r English was perfect
, and we were still children; so I don't think that we had 
any difficultly in that respect. 
 
Q: Do you know what
 the motivation was behind this inquiry? 
 
A: Oh yes. Themany Germans at the beginning 
of the war had been interned and sent to 
the Isle of Man and were not allowed to st
ay in areas which they considered to be 

important such as London and Birmingham a
nd Manchester and so 
on, but welljust like 
during th e first world war, lots of people di
dn't play Wagner because he was a German 
composer. So we were consider
ed German refugees rather than Jewish refugees. It was 
just the fact that my brother and I were so 
young that saved us from 
being interned in the 
first place. 
 
Q: You were considered  Ge
rman rather than Jewish? 
 
A: Yes, absolutely
. Yes, absolutely. 
 
Q: After Chichester you returned to
 London. Whom did you stay with? 
 
A: I went back and stayed with the Denims. By
 that time, my  foster brother had left and 
was in Sri Lanka and Marry was at university
 in Camb ridge, and my  brother had found 
himself a job with--with a la
wyer somewhere in 
London. So I was 
the only one that 
remained, and I stayed 
with the Denims. I had one scholarship in Ch ichester and decided 
that I wanted to go to secretarial school beca
use I was very much aware of the fact that I 
was being supported by people who were not my  
parents, and I also felt that if my parents 
were saved after the war, I would want to 
have a profession to  look after them. So I 
studied for a year to be a secretary shortha
nd in  typing and bookkeeping and got a job in 
a London law office. 
 
Q: In this London law office while you we
re work ing there, you remained with the 
Denims? 
 
A: Yes, I remained with the Denims, and 
I don't reme mber paying them any money for 
staying there. I mu st have offered it, but I gue
ss they just didn't  accept it, but I was very 
happy with them. We went to to church  to
gether because by that time I was converted. I 
became a Sunday  school teacher and mymymy  
remembrance is that Auntie Elsie took me 
to the Jewish community to le
t them know that I had been converted, and they  were not 
very happy about this, and I 
had some rabbi in Ox ford  who would write me letters and 
ask me to answer them to make sure that
 I knew what I was 
doing which I did for a 
while. 
 
Q: Your brother, what happened to
 his affiliation with Judaism?  
 
A: He had no affiliation to Juda
ism, but he also was not relig
ious in any other way. He 
ended up marrying an Eng
lish Christian girl and s
till lives in England now. 
 
Q: Did he raise his children with any affiliation?  
 
A: None whatsoever. 
 
Q: And when you married, did you rais
e your children with any affiliation? 
 

A: No, I did not. My husba
nd is Jewish also refugee from Germany, but he was not 
religious, and by that time I was n o  longer religio
us either so that we have brought up our 
children, he was in the foreign service. We 
brought them up all over the world, and we 
wanted th em to know 
about religions, but we were never religious. 
 
Q: Do your children identif
y themselves as Je wish?  
 
A: One daughter does because she is marri
ed  to a Jew, and although they are not 
religious, they don't g o  to syna
gogue at any time, but their son was Bar Mitzvah, so that's  
a sign of Judaism anyway. 
 
Q: And the other daughter?  
 
A: The other daughter was never religious. Sh
e's a professional, and she's about to marry 
a Catholic gentleman 
who is not religions. 
 
Q: Did you have anymore experien
ces after you return ed to London? 
 
A: Well, yes, we did. We had something 
called the doodlebugs. And th e V2  rockets 
which the Germans sent over; and 
for six weeks, were slept in 
an air raid shelter with 300 
other people, and we surviv ed it. I got to 
work  one mo rning, and the office had been 
bombed, and we had to clear out glass. And 
I was with a friend one weekend, and I had 
been making a hat in the garden and after a 
doodleb ug crashed nearby. It happen ed to end 
up in  a tree. We could never get to it again.
 But we spent a lot of time cleaning up after 
these doodlebugs. I didn't kno
w anybody who had been hurt 
by them, because by that 
time people were sleeping in sh elters. 
 
Q: What exactly are doodleb ugs? 
 
A: They are pilotless planes, r
eally, rocketsthe first rocket
s. And they were programmed 
to go down over cities such as
 London, and they would make
 a noise. You could hear the 
mo tor, and all of a sudden the mo to r would st
op, and within a few 
minutes it would crash 
so that whenever you heard 
the motor stop, you dove under 
the table because you were 
scared that it might crash right over you. 
 
Q: Did you continue to hear fro
m your parents during the war?  
 
A: We had a letter from our parents in 1941 ju
st before they left for Theresienstadt and 
asking us if we could raise 
a certain amount of money so
 they could go to  Sh anghai. 
Unfortunately, we couldn't ra
ise the money, and so th ey 
did go to Theresienstadt. I 
remember receiving one letter after they were 
in Theresienstadt, but after that we never 
did, and I think that we felt it was not po
ssible to write to them. We may have been 
wrong. Perhaps this could ha
ve been done, but we were 
so far away from anybody who 
could have given us any advice on
 this that we never did write and felt that if w e wrote, it 
would be construed as 
writing to the enemy. 
 

Q: What did happen to your parents,
 and how did you learn about it?  
 
A: My parents at one point in
 1944 were sent from Theresie
nstadt to Au schwitz, and I 
believe almost immediately killed there. Th
e way I found this out was after the war, I 
went to Germany as a translator for th e US War Department, and when I was in 
Germany, I used to go to th
e Joint Distribution Committee in
 Munich every week to see 
if I could find th eir names. And I would put 
in the names of all my entire family, of 
whom there were 18 memb ers, to see if anyb
ody got out alive, bu
t we heard from some 
lady who had met them in Auschwitz, and she 
said that they had been killed. And of 
course, their names never turned  up. Of all 
the people whom I put in
 traces fo r, only one 
aunt and one cousin were saved. 
 
Q: All the rest perished?  
 
A: Everyone else perished
. Everyone else perished. 
 
Q: Tell me more about your experience as 
a translator in Munich. When  did you go 
there?  What were the conditions?  
 
A: We were trained in Paris and given Americ
an uniforms. Then we went to a little place 
called Pullach, which is outside Munich , and I 
was a translator of letters which had been 
confiscated for censorship. Letters, that might
 have let us know where some Nazis were 
hiding so these could be prosecuted. I was 
only 18 at the time; so I was one of the 
youngest people there. All the camp consiste
d of elderly refugees who had been in 

England during the war. Also some American
Americans who had come to America as 
refugees, all of us speaking German and Englis
h of course. And I was there for two years, 
and after being there a year, and meeting some
 British people, I got to realize that I was 
really the only one who thought of myself 
as British. Everybody 
else all, the other 
English people that I knew thought of me as 
a German refugee. On the other hand, I felt 
that Americans had definitely 
assimilated, felt American, were treated as American and 
so I said okay I'm under 21, and I'm free, and I'm not close to my  brother really, and my  

parents are dead, and I decided to  immigrate to
 the United States. I wrote to an aunt in 
Los Angeles of whom I learned through her GI
 sons who were in London. And I was sent 
an affidavit, and so at the ripe old age of 21
, I came to the United States which was, apart 
from going to England, probably  one of 
the best decisions I could have made. 
 
Q: How did you learn about this oppor
tunity to translate in  Germany?  
 
A: I learned of it through a member of the church , strangely enough, who to ld me that 

Americans were hiring British 
subjectsBritishnot necessarily 
citizens, to go to  Germany, 
and I felt that was the best way 
to find out about my  parents. 
 
Q: Did youwere you well paid?  Were you ab
le to subsist on wh at you earned  there? 
 

A: We were very well paid, and I got to know
 a lot of people in the same position I was, 
and it was so wonderful to see the Germ
ans so poor and humiliated and little kids 
collecting cigarette stubs, and I think those 
two years in Germany got out of my  system 
this terrible hatred that I bore for the Germ
ans because after that, I was able to go to 
Austria as an American diplomatic wife 
and to  treat Austrians like any other people 
which I ma y not have been able
 to  do if I hadn't gotten this hatred out of my  system. 
 
Q: You have any other recollec
tions of this time that you
'd  like to share with us?  
 
A: Well, there is one more. Little Binette which I feel very strongly about and that was 
the Denims always prayed in th e living room
 before going to church, and it was toward 
the end of war, in fact it was after the war, and 
it was just before I went to Pullach that we 
were praying in  the living room, and after 
Uncle Norman finished
 his prayers Auntie 
Elsie, in a very unaccustomed 
manner because she never used 
to pray aloud, decided to 
pray, and say that if anything happened to
 my  parents and they  died, she could not 
believe that they would not go
 to heaven just b
ecause they  had not known Jesus Christ, 
and I'll never forget it. It was so
 touching. It still makings me cry. 
 
Q: Thank you very much, Joan. This has been
 a very in teresting and wo rthwhile history 
to share with the researcher
s of the Holocaust Museum. 
 
A: You're v ery we
lcome. Thank you. 
 
Q: For the record I'm interv
iewing, Joan Schwab. Will you 
please give me your date of 
birth, city of birth, and the full 
name of both of 
your parents?  
 
A: I was born on March 24, 1926, together w
ith my brother Hans in Berlin, Germany. My 
parents were Israel Nusboum a
nd Tony Nu sboum (?Ne Ziheil?) 
 
Conclusion of Interview
