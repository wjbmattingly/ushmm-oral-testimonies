JULIAN NOGA 
December 11, 1990 
 
Q: Good morning. Would you tell me
 your name , your date of bi
rth and your place of birth? 
 
A: Yes. ____. Julian Noga. I was born in Poland but
 actually my  life starts
 in this country, 
United States. In 1921 my whole fa mily was in
 this country...my father, my mother, my 
two brothers and then in June 1921, my mother
 decide to go back to Poland and after she 
arrived in Poland, two months after, on July 
31st, I was born in Poland, so that's  my... 
 

Q: Where in Poland? 

 

A: Ah, that was a little uh village by the na
me  how pronounced Skrzynce (ph). This is the 
county of Dabrowa (ph) a
nd the state of Krakow. 
 

Q: In the st ate of Krakow. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Can you tell me a little 
bit about your uh childhood? 
 

A: Yes. I was grow uh grow up on the country, 
up to sixteen. When I was sixteen years old, 
I go to the big city by the name  Tarnow (ph), and  I start working as a dishwasher in a 

very elegant Jewish club by the name Musa on Si berski Square, right 
in the center of the 
city of Tarnow. I was there for some  
 

01:02:   

 
time as a dishwasher. Then after I decided to 
go and learn to be baker and that's  not quite 

two years, about two years I was learned to 
be baker. And that's  1939 the war started.  
 

Q: What was your first recollection 
of the German invasion of Poland? 
 

A: Yes, that was on Friday, September 1st. Earl
y in the morning I was delivered as usual out 
back to the groceries and I was in a city a
nd I find out from one of
 the grocer that the 
Germans invade Poland and that was a shock 
to me . I was about eigh
teen years old that 
time and then right away you see those sire
ns sounds and the me gaphone sounds through 
the me gaphone speakers. You know, they announc
e that the German attacked Poland and 
they break out the border, you know, a
nd they are already going in Poland. 
 

Q: How far was  your...the town of Tarn
ow from the German-Pol ish border? 

 

A: I should say about tw
o hundred kilome ter. 
 

Q: And how long before the Germans came to your town?

A: I can't  tell you exactly but that was about another week or so they ma rched through the 
Tarnow and that was scary. 
 

Q: What was...what impact did them comi ng to the town have on you initially?  How did it 
change your life at first? 
 

A: Well, at that time my life was changed. The 
bakery was closed. I have to go back to my 
mother on the country and the 
 

01:04:30   

 
Germans  put the posters all over. They expl
ain why they are there and everything going 

to be now under the German rules and when you break the law, there be a death sentence, 

Totesstrafe. That was very scary. And you see ho
w they start arreste
d. First of all they 
go...they come  to another small, small town
 by the name  Strutch(? }. This is on the 
Vistula River and first day that the German 
come s, they pick up twenty-seven Jewish 
people, those Jewish we know like some ...one of
 the Jews I know very very good. He had 
a tobacco store. The other one had a restau
rant . Another one, he was a cabinet ma ker. 
Many of my  friends learn how 
to ma ke cabinets by this Jew who was very nice ma n and a 
photographer, I reme mb er his name  Pilschnik. They took him. Twenty-seven Jewish 

people they take. They bring to the church ther
e. They give them the shovels and they dig 
out their   01:06:  own graves and they 
was executed right there the by the church, and 
that was scary. That we see what that means a
nd what this going to be like, and that was 
really...that was some thing, you know
, some thing I never forget. 
 
Q: And you we re back on the farm with your pa
rents and your brothers and sisters after the 
bakery closed down, and what happened...wha
t did you do after you went back to your 
parents? 
 

A: Yes. My parents, I beg your pardon...my fa
ther stays in this country. He didn't go to 
Poland. My mother pick up three of my 
brothers...Matthew, Bruno and John. Matthew 
was thirteen years old. Br uno was seven years 
old and  John was five years old and after 
she arrive Poland, two months later on July 
31st, I was born, 1921. Yes. So before the 
war, each my brother come  back to this count
ry and the last one, John, he come  back to 
this country in 1938, just a year before the war 
broke out, and I was a li
ttle bit jealous see, 
because I didn't have chance to come back to 
this country, so actually I stay only with my 
mother. My mother didn't have much land. Sh
e had about three or four acre, not quite 
four acres land. There was plenty food for us 
and that time after the Germans come, there 
was not muc h to do and we wouldn't  know what do to and what to expect, so I was 

arrested 01:08:  because I tell you why. As the Polish soldier back up, there was so many 
weapons and happened in the woods I find a beau
tiful new rifle, Army rifl e, and I bring  
it home and I hide the rifle in a barn, in a 
haystack and that time  if you'r e hiding any 
weapons...the posters was all over, you know
...that means death sentence. There was no 
question about that. But they give us time  
up to I forgot...November 10 or some thing like 
that. Anything belongs to the Army, gove
rnme nt, any weapons, ammunition, even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
3 
 
blankets, we should turn to the Germans. Af
ter that if you keep so
mething like that and 
they find out, there be a death sentence for that. 
So but that rifl e, I didn't...I didn't give it 
back. Now I thought ma ybe some da y I going to
 use it, but some body 
somehow  squeal on 
me to the German Gestapo and they come. They 
arrest me , right there in the village, next 
village and they kept me  there for three week
s, in Nove mber 1939, and they treat me  very 
rough. If I tell you I get seventy-five on my rear
 end...they tied me  to the bench and they 
tell 01:10:  me...they tell me if I won't bri
ng that weapon, they going to shoot me , and I 
tell them I haven't got no weapon and some ho
w some body from the village...I think there 
was  some  people, you know, had me out and th
ey talk from me I am innocent. I just 
come from the city. I was a baker, you know
. I had nothing to do, but the chief of the 
Gestapo says now you too danger for me . Th
e ne xt week, on Wednesday, I want you be 
here and we assign you in for the work, for the farm working the German, and you got to 

be here about nine o'clock We dnesday. I fo
rgot what day was it. I believe that was 
December 6th, on We dnesday some where as far 
as I can remember, so I sign a paper and 

they took us to Germany. Happened by good luck
 we landed in Austria, which was much 
better. We go through Czechoslovaki a. We stay overnight  in Vienna. We come to 

Austria, to Li nz and from Linz we come  to th
e little town, a little city I should say, by the 

name  _? ? ______ in Austria, and we come  to the place, unemployment office and the 

01:12:  farmers was waiting for us. If I te
ll you the story you wouldn't believe. From my 
village ther e was a fr iend of mi ne with me 
by the name  Frankie (ph) and both of us we 

was assigned to the big, the biggest farm in 
that area, in that county I should say, and 
guess who picked us up. My wife Frieda. Sh
e was at that time...gosh, nineteen...nineteen 
years old, twenty. Father sent her to the 
unemp loyment office and she bring us home. 
Matter of fact they give us the taxi like a
bout short before the house there was the kind of 
hill and the taxi couldn't make it because was 
quite a snow ther e at that time there in 
Austria, so at that place..
.oh, about a half a mile, we have
 to...half a kilome ter I should 
say...we walked, and here we come  on that farm and by gosh two big dogs because the 

father of the far mer...he was more than a fa
rmer you see. He was a very wealthy, wealthy 
ma n...the biggest in the area. He had also 
hunting area. I don't  know
 how many thousands 
and thousands acres of hunting, and that 
hunting was in that house for over a hundred 
years, so he had the two big hunting dogs. Th
ey greet us, you know, first. (Laughter)  I 
look at them if either one of them goi ng to 
bite me, and we and friend of mi ne Frankie, 
we come  over there and here they greet us. 
Right away they show us the room where 
we'r e going to sleep. There was two beds. We
 put the suitcases there and we wash 

ourselves...hands...and they invite us for the bi
g supper, and I reme mber that first supper 
in that house. There was a heavy, hot stew, like 
an Irish stew, see. Ha
lf and half with the 
meat, you know...very good...and we was hungry 
though and was tasting good, and here 

come s the whole family. There was four da
ughters and the parents and probably about 
four...that time...three or four workers. Theywork for that big far m. There was almos t  

winter time you see. Summer time t hey hire fo
urteen, fifteen people 
they hire for the 
work, and that's what our...my job be
gin in Austria on that farm. Yes. 
 

Q: What kind of work were you doing? 

 

A: Yeah. We ll, the next day we didn't do 
nothing. They show us, you know, what we'r e 
supposed to do and I think on Monday we work on the ma nure, see. We  loaded the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
4 
 
ma nure on a 01:15:  wagon. There was a one pa
ir ox(en) and one pair horses, and they 
wanted their daughter, Fr ieda, which is my
 wi fe now...we 're going to talk about her 
(laughter) later on...she was working with 
the horses. Big horses. Oh my God, and a 
friend of mi ne Frankie...they give him the 
pair of oxes. Oxes. Right...I pronounce alright 
oxes...yes. And we was  working with them
, you know, and they put the ma nure on...we 
put the ma nure on a _??___. Then after that they
 had also about twenty acres of forest 
belong to that farm, so during the wint
er time we  was cutting the woods, you know, 
piling, se nding to the saw mill, you know. Y
eah. And food was good I must say. Plenty 
food, yes. If I tell you there was meat twice 
a day you wouldn't believe even that time, 
and  they treat us pretty good. You got to 
work. So long you work, put your twelve hours 
a day, you're alright. So they tr
eat us pretty good, I must say.  
 
Q: How long did you stay on the farm?  

 

A: Not very long. See, it's happen...it's hard to
 explain how this happen. Now that Frieda, the 
one of the daughter...I use to help her and oh for some  reason we liked each other. You 

know...I was young that time . She wa s young and we
 liked each other, see. And I think 
this is little bit too far gone, so the family
 notice some thing too close friendship here in 
between us. 01:17:   So that was  on Nove mb
er...or before November 1941, the father had 
a speech to me  and to Frieda. We  know you 
two close together. You know what it is. She 

go to the concentration camp and you going to
 be dead ma n. One of you got to go. You 
can't  stay together, so which one going to go?  
Leave the farm. One of us. Either Fr ieda or 

me . I says my gosh. This is your daughter. 
She should stay. Well, it's up to here, up to 
her. I don't care. So Frieda decided to leav
e the house, and I stayed. Yeah. That was 
some thing from a big house, you know, like that for a big family, very well-known 

fa mily. She go to the unemployme nt  office a
nd they sent her off I should say about ten, 
fifteen kilome ter away on a smaller far m, but soon I find out where the fa rm is and once a 

while on Sunday we meet again. Wa s nothi
ng in between us except a very close 
friendship. OK. And then not 
long after that some body squeal
 on us, so I was arrested 
from the Gestapo and Frieda was arrested a
nd we  was brought to 01:
19:  that very well-
known Gestapo in Linz on the Donau in Aust
ria. There was...all foreigners who was 
working there in Austria, they know what...what it is Gestapo in Linz, you know. There 

was the toughest Gestapo in in 
in Austria I should say. So they keep us for eleven days. 
They keep me  eleven days. I don't know. Frieda
 I think she was thirteen days, and they 
couldn't prove anything because actually 
it was nothing between us except  a good 
friendship so what happened they call me  in one day and they says OK, we believe you. 

You had nothing to do with Frieda Gr einegger
 (ph)...that's what her name was. We let 
you go, but  01:20:  before we let you go you got
 to sign this paper, and there was the 
whole so ma ny points, you know, what is agains
t the law, and the very last one was to 
any friendship with German or Aust rian girl
...that sentence by hanging. 
They tell us this. 
They tell me , so you remember this. If you see Frieda again, you're going to be hung. 

Understand? Understand, OK. But he says 
here you go on the unemployment office and 
the unemployment office going to send you diffe rent direction where I was 

before...different direction of about I should say 
about fifteen kilome ter  from Linz or as 
by the railroad there as you go to Vienna, you know. Differ
ent directions, see. Now you 
go back where you were, pick up you belongi
ngs and you go on that on that farm. The y 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
5 
 
know about and you going to work over there an
d reme mber, behave yourselves. Yes sir. 
I says yes sir. So I go to Frieda's parent
s where I was before, pick up my suitcase and 
everything and then I think that was on Monda
y I was going back. Come  back to Linz on 
a railroad depot and waiting for my train go to
 that direction where I was assigned for the 
new far m, and you wouldn't believe how this 
happen. You you mi ght call it coincidence, 
but that's what happened. Here I walk in a 
third class in Linz on a railroad and here 
comes the Frieda. But we didn't stop. We ju
st go by and she told me  some thing like 
follow me , so we go in a place and you got 
to be careful because you don't know...ma ybe 
they watch you, you know. Who knows. And then she told me  she's assigned to another 

far m, not home. They di dn't send her home . Di
fferent di rection on th
e other side of the 
city, again you know. They try to keep us as 
far apart as possible s
ee, and then she told 
me  OK...not  this Sunday, next Sunday I meet
 you on a Landstrasse by __?? ___. This is a 
little city _?? __ between Linz 
and that farm wher e Frieda's
 parents where I was working. 
I meet you on a highway. Highway means, 011:23:  you know, Landstrasse. I meet you 
there on certain time . I forgot what was it
...one o'clock or two o'clock afternoon. I going 
to be on a bicycle there and I meet you ther
e. I says Frieda, my gosh, suppose some body 
watch us. You know what that means. She says 
that's alright. Whatever happen I want to 

see you then, you see. So good enough. I think th
ere was two week after I did borrow a 
bicycle from my new far mer, you know, from 
that new farmer and he was a very fine 
ma n. Even s o, he was a me mber of the party bu
t he was just a me mber for of the party so 
he get the machineries, you know, and this 
and this, and they di
scover him after, you 
know, by the end. They find out he was fooling 
and and they they they draw him to the 
Ar my and he was a prisoner in English...the 
English took him, yeah. Anyway, he was a 
fine ma n. He says well, OK. You want a  bi
cycle. Go. Now tricky was there if you want 
be not recognize, you got to dressed up the 
same  as the Austrian you know, wear their 
suits. So I had a nice grey suit with the green stripes on the side, you know, how those 
Austrians are and their short jacket
, you know. I don't know...Eisenhower you call 
it...(laughter)...the jacket and 
I had a green hat with a big 
brush (ph) in the back, you 
know. I looked like an Austrian see. So wh
en I ride the bicycl
e nobody pay attention, you 
know. You know what I mean....you have to be dr
essed like that because actually for the 
Polish workers...first of all, you're supposed to
 have that P. There 
01:25:  was a square, 
yellow square ma de out of the cloth ___ a
nd there was a purple...purple P. Ugly. And you 
have to have this, you know. You ha ve to w
ear all the time, all th
e time this over here. 
Yes, I did have. I have on this side, s
ee. If I see the polic
e, you know, I was no 
way...where's your P. Yes, I got it here. I 
I got it here, yeah. We ll, says now wait a 
mi nute. That's supposed to be on this side. Yes,
 it's  OK. I put it on this side, see. We ll, 
anyway and happen after two weeks I meet Frie
da or whatever and sh
e told me, she told 
me , you know, where the farm is. M a tter of fact
 we ride over there and she show me  and 
says next time  when you come  there's a w
oods over here. We 'r e going to meet over here. 
I says Frieda, what are we  doing?  They'r e 
going to kill us, both of us. Maybe not you, but 
(laughter) they'r e going to hang me  a nyplace 
you know. And s a ys well, Julie (ph), I like  
you so much. Tell you the truth I can't  live 
without you. I says Frieda, you know what 
you're talking. This is a death sentence. I don't 
care. To me  it's worth it. There you are. So 
that was going fine. There was a small farm
 which to Frieda was working. I was happy. 
She was happy. I was doing the whole work. I had 
a nice pair of horse
s there. I take care 
of the whole far m because the farmer, he 
was a little guy, you know, and he didn't want 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
6 
 
to work hard see. He had a new tractor there. We ll,when there was anything to do with 
the tractor, he was sitting on a tractor, 
you know, but with the hor
ses the most job, you 
know, I was doing, you know. He wa s 01:27:  ve
ry glad and I was working hard and 
same  thing Frieda was working on that little
 farm where she was. She was working fine. 

Everything was there fine, but meantime the Ge
stapo told the farmer where Frieda was 
working...look and watch it because she ha
d something to do with Polish guy. If you 
know anything, if you notice anything, le
t us know. And good enough...how long you can 
hide. Sooner or later they found...they did 
find out...I don't know how...that that we was 
together, and he didn't ma ke any report to th
e Ge stapo. So long Frieda was working there, 
fine. But Frieda ma ke one mi stake. She want 
to quit that farm and go work in a city for 
the  airplane factory, mo re money, more 
time , you know. And th
at was the biggest 
mi stake Frieda ma ke. And that's what the tr
ouble start right then. 
So when the little 
far mer where Frieda was working find out sh
e going to quit, she 
call up...he call up the 
Gestapo and Frieda was arrested
 first. I didn't know. And we had a...we had a date at that 
time, you know. That was on end of the week, yeah. I go over there and where we usually 

meet, Frieda wasn't  there. So I had a bad 
feeling. Something happe
ned. Is she sick?  But 
there was no way to find out. But I no have 
to wait long to find out what happen. So good 
enough...that was I believe was on a Frid
ay, September 19, 1941. We  wa s digging 
potatoes. I was working on on my farm. 01:29:  I mean on that farm wher e I was 
working. I was working with the horses. I had that machine, you know...dig out the 

potatoes, and we was working afternoon. At
 noon we bring some potatoes home and we 
go for lunch. Good enough. We  was in a dining 
room. We  was eating and here to the 
kitchen from the other side comes the policem
an and he talk, because the farmer and his 
wife and the old parents, they was eati
ng in the kitchen and we  was eating the 

workers...there was two girls and a one Fren
chman, a prisoner, prisoner from the French 
army...Louis...he was with us. We  wa s eating th
ere and I hear in the kitchen...I hear my 
name  and what I hear what the farmer was answering, he's very good. He's a hard worker. 

He's  a good ma n, yeah. And he was putting down. 
Then nice, not rush, the policeman was 

waiting till we finish and then he come  to 
the living room and says, Julius Noga...I was 

called by Julius in German. Julius Noga. I wa
nt you to dress up and pick up whatever you 
want to pick up and you go with me  to Linz. I 
says sir, is that Ge
stapo?  Yep. Ah...to live 
or not. I was speechless. I says yeah, y
eah, yeah. Come  on. Dress you up. Wash you up. 
Dress you up, yeah. I wait for you. So I go to my
 room. I go to my two horses, you know. 
I clapthem. I givethem some more oats
, a little more 01:31:30  hay. I clap them. I 
know...I know I no going to see those horses a
ny more. Then I dressed up. He says  
whatever  you need like shaving or
 equipment or whatever you need, 
whatever...toothpaste, brush, wh
atever you think, take it. 
But don't take too much. You 
don't need it. I know I don't need it. So he
re was another very important...I don't know 
how much did help. Now Polish worker not 
supposed to drive the bicycle and not 
supposed to ride a train. Now the Polis
h people was treated very...you know, Polish 
worker, you know...they're worse, you know. Y
eah. Like Czechoslovak, they cannot ride 

their bicycle. They ride a train, but not Polish 
people. There wa s strict, very strict. So but 
ma ny ti me s when I go see Frieda on the othe
r side of city, there was...I forget...oh 
probably what was it...forty, fift
y...no, forty kilome ter, so ride
 the bicycle wa
s a little bit 
too far for me you know. What I was doing I go with the bicycle on a on a depot and put 

the bicycle in the box car, th
e first one always was box car 
there. Put the bicycle on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
7 
 
train and go to the last cit
y, take the bicycle...you know, 
pay extra...it was cheap, you 
know, that time. Take the bicycle and go wher
ever you want to go. But here we come  on 
that depot with the policeman and  we suppos
ed to go by train to the Linz what was only 
sixteen, eighteen kilome ters, ____?? _______, andthis is close to the concentration camp 
Mauthausen there, that direc
tion. So first thing he come  to
 the window where they sell 
the tickets and that was the guy by the name  
Schottinger (ph) . He used to be very good 
friend to my  far mer and every day as I delive
red the milk on six o'clock train, I delivered 
for him a little canned milk, see, and each time  I go some where when he was there, he  

sold me  the train tickets, you see. So the fi
rst thing the policeman 
asked him, did you ever 
sell the  ticket to this to th
is Pole. He looked at me  and I 
see in his eyes. He look at me . 
He understand. He says never. I says God 
bless you. I never...if
 I live through, you're 
going to be my friend. So OK. So we go outsi
de by the track. We 'r e waiting for the train 
and here comes the train from Vienna, a
nd I was thinking my gosh, suppose when the 
train come , you know...I long before study??  a
nd I lay myself on a rail. I was ready to 
commit suicide, but you know, when you come
 t o some thing like that, you always 
some where in the back you always had hope ma ybe mi racle happen. Maybe it's too soon. 

OK. So we go on the train and we come  to Li
nz and from Linz  Bahnhof, railroad station. 
We  walk to the Gestapo. Straight  to the Ge
stapo offices. Not to the jail. To the Gestapo. 

Four hardy, strong Gestapo me n was waiting fo
r me . Ah, you are come . Julius Noga. Ah. 

Hum. We 'r e waiting for you. Yeah. Now you'r e 
not going to tell us this time. You 
reme mber 01:36:  you sign that list you no 
going to have...I mean you're not going to 
have nothing to do with the Austrian girl. 
You reme mber that. Here it is. Did you sign 
that?  Yeah. Now, and you're still with her,
 right. I says no. What?  You no see Fraulein 
Greinegger? No. Hmm. Hey, Hans, he says
 he didn't see her. You know what the 
guy...one talked to the other one. We ll, you know...he's  liar, you know. He says you son 

of a so-and-so. You Sau (pig). Pow. Pow.

tell us the truth, you'll never come  out of th

the concentration camp. You better tell us

did you come out from t hat big house with th
e rich, very well-know fa mily?  How did you 
come  to have some thing to do with a guy, 
a Pole worker?  He was working for your 
parents. How did you come ?  What you got to do
 with him?  You're beautiful girl. And 
this is true , because she was...she was beauti
ful. 01:40:  I got the picture. She had three 
sisters and all of them was beautiful. And 
she start cry. She didn't answer, but they say 
OK, you tell him, and she says yes. We
 meet. How many times?  I don't know how many 
times. OK. Now, what you got to say, they 
ask me. You see, if you tell us from the 
beginning we  wouldn't hit you that much. OK. So
 that's  all what they want to know. We 
talk some  more tomorrow to you. Go outside and face the wall close. One of them br ing 

me  there and when you go on a on a wall, you st
ay close to the wall and face the wall, 
see. Face the wall like this. And don't tur
n, you know. And you stay there, and they took 
Frieda there. I don't know where they took her a
nd then I see this is it. And then next day 
they ask some  more question. Th
ey take the pictures from three sides...from the front, 
from this side, from this side...they took the pi
cture. They took us to the...of course, there 
was more prisoners...they took us to the docto
r. They weighed us. They me asure us. You 
know, I don't know why they did it, but they did 
it. Oh, when we come  to that doctor that 
was some thing. That was a private doctor, a pr
ivate practice this doc
tor. And the Gestapo 
ma n...there was four of us and we was...we ha
d that what you call it...that chain, handcuff 
and there in the office there 
was a a window or there was a bar on the window, bars, and 

he chain us to that bar and here was civi
lian people sitting, you know, and they shake 
their hand you know, and he looked at it, 
you know. He probably...they fe el good so he 
unchain us there 01:42:30  and he keep the 
eye on us. Yeah. Well, from t hen there was 
more and more question. They didn't hit 
me  no more after that. Yeah. OK. And good 
enough. Wh en they finish...when they bring me  to
 that jail on in Linz on Mozart St rasse, 
Polizei Presidium that's the name  wa s... there was a very mo dern jail, built in 1938. 

Everything push button. Clean. Very very tough. 
There was no way to run away from that 
jail. No way. So from my previous...from my
 last year experience I know that cell  Cell 
Number Five...they peel the pot
atoes, and I knew they had enough food, so in our office 
before they give me  the cell, I asked the 
inspector would you please put me on cellar...on 
Cell Five. He  says well, I don't know. I think 
Cell Five is crowded, but he call up that 
guard there, ask you got room on Cell Five for 
one more man, and I remember that guard 
name ...Rollinger (ph)...blond guy, tall guy. He says
 oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I have room for 
another guy. They put me on on Cell Nu
mber Five, and good enough. We  peel the 
potatoes. Before noon we peeled  boiler pota
toes and we had a salt and boiled potatoes 
you can eat how much you want, you know, and th
en afternoon whatever left over, they 
give us the leftover too, so that was plen
ty food there. So that was good. That was good. 
That was in Nove mber. Short before Chri
stma s, the Gestapo...I don't know for what 
reason take us, about thirteen 
guys, put us in a black van an
d bring us to another city 
closer to the previous farm 
where Frieda's parents are. Wa s the next city though, pretty 
01:45;  good sized city and they put us in an
 old jail and I reme mber the the street, SA 
Strasse. And there was a very small jail, ve
ry old prison and we stayed there over the 
Christma s and during the winter two guys co
me from Linz, from the headquarters, a 
prisoner, Polish guy, and they tell us what
 the Gestapo do. They 
hanging people in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
9 
 
woods and they send to the concentration camp and you...it's going to happen same  thing 
to us. So what should we do?  My gosh...thi
s is occasion over here. We  mi ght have a 

chance to run away from this, from this 
jail see. There was two old guards and the 
inspector and  that was th
e ??_____ how ma ny prisoners there. They coming and going 

oh ma ybe twenty, thirty pris
oners, you know. They comi ng 
for short time, you know, like 
those guys don't want to work on a farm or do some  some thi ng wrong, you know, and 

they give them for the...the
y give them for the few...ja
il for the few days. You are no 
bread, nothing and no food and they keep them
 three, four, five days hungry, you know, 
and they give them good advice, you know. 
Go back and work. Next time when you 

come , we going to keep you here two weeks without the food or we'r e going to send you 

to the conc entration camp, so they they scar
ed the people. OK. So now here what we'r e 
doing here...what's  the what's  the reason they bring us over here. Nobody knows, but 

those two guys tell us we better run away if
 we got chance. OK. So how we going to run 
away?  There was thirteen guys all together, 
all Polish. We  was on that cell, so one of 
them was shoema ker. Walter was his name . 
He was a shoema ker. He says you...that bar 

in the window, if we cut just one of them 
and we lifted it, we can go through, and there 
was a screen, thin screen. If you cut just 
the one, you you you can ma ke a hole. You can 

open it, see. Yeah. But where we going to get th
e saw. He says well, we got to figure out 
some thing, so next morning we go...in the morning we go on a on a hall for.. there was a 

big sink where we washed ourselves and then
 you can go toilet there and there was a guy 

and he had those high boots. A guy...he was ju
st a short for one week. He had 01:48:  
those high, high boots and then Wa lter looked 
at those boots and he says my gosh, I 
know...I'm shoema ker...I know this...in those boots, you know, there's strip of me tal, of 

good steel. He said ma ybe we can make a sa
w out of this. So Wa lter go and talk to 
him...how long you are here. Oh I'm here al
ready third day. You hungry?  Oh my gosh, 
I'm hungry. I didn't eat for three days. He sa
ys look, you want to se
ll those boots?  Yeah. 
Yeah. Look, we give you ...we exchange. We  
exchange, or something like that. We 
exchange the shoes...you you need the shoes, ye
ah, and we give you half a loaf bread for 
the...good, good. OK. So we give those pieces, make a half a loaf, and we get them. 

You'd be sur prised. He pull out those steel 
plates, you know, narrow one, steel. This is a 
good steel. Now, how we going to ma ke a 
saw now?  OK. Figure out. Walter says why 
don't we break the shoe and call up the guard. Maybe they got the hamme r  and some  

nails, you know, fixed up the, you know, sole, you know. Good enough. Pushed the 

button. The old guard come ...Austrian with 
their big mustache...yeah...he smoked a pipe, 

yeah. What is it?  Oh I says Herr Wa c h me ister, Wachme ister 01:50:  you call him, the 

guy...look, my shoes is broke. You you got hammer 
and some thing we can fix?  We l l , yes. 
I look. I think we got some thing upstairs, yes.
 So he go upstairs. He come  not only with 
the hammer and nails, short nails
, but he bring us that what 
you call that steel stand like 
for the shoes, you know, ___?? ______. I don't know
 what you call that ...like you fix the 
soles...you you you put on that steel plate lik
e, you know, ma de like a lace (ph) or 
some thing, you know. Steel lace I should say. OK.
 So Wa lter...Walter says look. How we 
going to ma ke it?  So we put those two plates
 close, right?  Anot
her guy hit with the 
hammer and we go like this. We  go like this, 
and when they get two saws in one. How 
whether the saw going to cut now?  Now we 'r e 
going to try out, and that that was the 
week before Palm Sunda y in April 1942. OK. So  the very first night we start...we tried 

that saw, and by gosh, you'd be surprised how
 that saw was  cutting the bar. We  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
10 
 
couldn't...we couldn't cut just like that
, you know, steady. No. They upstairs. Maybe 
some body hear, so we tied the bar with the blan
ket and go just a litt
le bit, slow you know, 
and believe me ...about four o'clock in the mo
rning...we start about nine o'clock in the 
evening to cut little by little.
 About four o'clock in the morning we got that through and 
there was a square bar, I should say one 
inch by one inch thick. And good enough there 
was not so tight together, so we cut the 
second  one on the bottom. There was only one 
cross bar in the mi ddle, so we figured out when
 we cut it on the bottom, so we grab it and 
bend it up and this was big enough...what we ha
d to do just to the thin screen was 
outside...just cut the once you know, and then 
we run away. Then...but before we did it, 
we swear, we make a promise...we go all of
 us, thirteen guys. We  go out, and we all 
decided to run away. OK. And that that night
 going to be Palm Sunday,  Saturday before 

the Palm Sunday, so Palm Sunday we going to
 be 01:53:  out. OK. Good enough. Then 
that ni ght come s, the Saturday, and we pray as usual. We  had a supper. We go a little bit 

early to the sleep but me antime I forgot to 
tell you...the very same  day one of the guard 
come  and he  says he needed two me n for some  kind of work there, for short time , so he 

took two guys and they were there oh I'd sa
y for a couple of hours. Then they comi ng 
back, and that bar was already 
cut, so when they come  ba
ck we ask, did the guard ask 
you some thing?  Did he notice...notice anythi
ng? No, no, no, no. He didn't say...he didn't  
ask no question, no no. They don't know nothing. OK. So tonight we'r e going to go. Good 

enough. So that that that evening, after the s
upper, we go a little b
it early and we'r e going 
to start around ten o'clock. We 'r e going to 
go out. And we already had plans, you know...I 
go with you and you go with him, you know...a
ll different direction and we ma ke 
agreement we going to walk, run away only by 
night. If we have to go by the by the  day, 

we have to have either shovel or fork or
 some thing carry, you know, ma ke  believe you go 
to the work so you won't  be stopped by the 
by the policemen when you go far, and the 
first night we got to go as far, as far awa
y, and there was a river over there and we should 
pass that river. It wasn't  very deep. We 
should pass that river for one reason...when they 
chase us with the dogs, when the dogs come  
into the water...that's what we understand 
that time...they going to loose their tracks, 
see. Good enough. So that night we go early 
bed and we wasn't ...it wasn't  long we hear
 the guards come , open our cell and the 

inspector was with them, and first thi
ng he ask why you guys going so early sleep 
tonight. Nobody says nothing. Come  on...get up. 
Get up. And there was a long bed ma de 
out of the ____. There was no ma ttresses. Ther
e was just the blankets, from one wall to 
the windows...a long one bed, you know, like a...a
bout that high...like a like a floor. OK. 
We get up. He jump on that bed, go straight, 
open the window, pick up the knife from his 
pocket and on that particular bar start 
from the mi ddle and go way down...oh, and we 
covered that cut...we ma ke it go  under the 
___ and we covered the cut and and we had 
black shoe cream. We  put the...because the 
bar was black, we put the cream...that that 

that black shoe cream...we put it on, so...yea
h...so that's  why he go with the knife. He 
knows which bar is it, see, and then his knife fa
ll in that cut. He says
, I see. He cleaning it 
up a little bit, put the knife 
there...so, you cut the bar huh. Y
ou want to run away. Hmmm. 
He s mile, you know. That's  bad, you know...he 
smile. I don't know for what reason he 
come  straight to me  and says  where is 01:

Tape #2 
 
Q: Would you continue the st
ory from when you and the two other prisoners were 
transferred to Cell One?  
 

A: Yes. That was a cell called in German Korr
ection (ph) cell. Now, what is correction cell?  
This is windowless cell, dark, 
concrete on the floor and there was three of us...me, Wa lter 
_____ and John Jachinsky...Yachinsky, and for three 
of us they give us only one blanket 
and that was the Holy Week before Ea ster
 Sunday. We  spent the whole week over there 
and Easter over there. That was very sad 
because we couldn't see much, but you after you 

stay so in a dark cell for a while, you know
, you beginning to see (laughter)...right. So 
after Easter...that was on Tuesday... th
ey send a Gestapo ma n, happen he was 
photographer. That's the guy ma ke those pictures
, first one when we was arrested, and he 
come  and pick me  up. That was on Tuesday, an
d he chain my hands. He want to chain 
my hands in the back and I beg him to chain my my hands on on on the front, handcuff. 

And we go on a railroad depot and I reme mber
 there was so ma ny Ger man soldiers was 

going on a east front, Russia, was ____  there, 
but we come with the 
regular train from  
____ to Linz what is like I said fifteen kilome
ter, some thing like that 02:02:  and that was 
a third class train. There was 
a one lady sitting there and he
 excuse her...would you please 
leave this compartment or what you call that
 part of the train and there was a window 
open. He closed that window and I was sit ther
e vis-a-vis with him. And that time  I wa s 

in a good mood for some reason. I know this is
 my last days, you know. I know what they 
going to do me . I was so sure, hundred percent 
sure I was, but I was wrong. And I say ...I 
look at it through the window from
 from the from the train. I 
see how they work in the 
field. Some body was plowing there with the 
horses, you know, and it remi nds me  how I 
use to plow the ground there on the last farm
 where I was. How much I would give to 
change the pl ace with that guy who was plowing th
at that land, that land there, and then I 
start joking with the Gestapo ma n. I...I di
dn't care whatever they going to do. I know 

what they going to do to me . I says hey Inspector. So I know the Gestapo going to hang 

me  or they probably going to hang hang me  
or they going to shoot me , so which...what 
they going...you can talk to me
, you know. It doesn't  ma tter.
 I know you going to kill me  
anyway. He says who told you that. I says th
ere was a two guys come  over there in a ___ 
in the cell and they tell us how many alre
ady you hanged and 02:04 
  how ma ny already 
you shoot. I was so open I I didn't give a damn, you know. I was  _____. He says no, you 

not going to be hanged and you you not going to
 be shot. Gestapo want to see you and 
ask you a few questions. I says what Ge
stapo want to know more. Gestapo knows 
everything about me . He  says well, I don't 
know. Don't ask me. I don't know what they 
want to ask you. He says yeah. So was sit
ting there, sitting, y
ou know. Then again, you 
know, I asked hey Inspector, so when this going to be?  Today or...it's early in the 

morning, you know, you still got time when...toda
y or tomorrow?  And where they going 
to go? Where I was working there, because usua lly what they did in a case s like that, they 

take the guy they want to hang. They...day befo
re they call up all foreigners on certain 
day. Next day certain day in the woods where they going to hang that ma n, you know, in 

the woods. So they show...so they scare hi
m, sa y you no work. If you not listen, that's 
going to happen same  thing to you, see, 
so I says you going to probably...you going to 
bring me  to ____?  Sankt Florian, that's th
e place was the __?___ and probably and go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
13 
 
some where in the woods you going to hang me . Then he was little bit upset. He says now 
listen. I no want to hear that from you. I 
tell you once you not going to be hanged and you 

not going to be shot. We  go to the Gestapo. We ll, good enough. So we come  to the Linz 

on the same very familiar railroad station, y
eah, and from the from 
that station to the 
Gestapo, not to the jail on Mozartstrasse. We  was  walking. So I come  to the office and in 

the office they open a book and they 02:06: 
 look at my na me. Says oh...that's the one 
was involved in boycotting in Vels?  ____. He's  
danger. Ah ha. It says you guys cut the 
bar. You want to run away, what you head
ing...which you was thinking. Where you turn 
wrong...where?  Where?  How can you hiding?  
I says well, we try...you know...I I don't 
care. I know I'm dead man anyway. So I sa
ys hey Inspector, would you please do me  one 
favor?  Yes, what is it?  Woul
d you please put me on on Cell ag
ain Numb er Five?  He says, 
ah you hungry. Not quite. I like to peel the pota
toes before I die. What?  Before you die?  
Who told you you going to die. I says I got that
 feeling. Ah, forget it.
 So they call up the 
guard and they put me on Cell Five, and tha
nks God, because from April after the Easter 

up to August 1st I believe, I was on Ce
ll Five. We had plenty food. Nothing 
special...potatoes, carrots, carrots, beets, whatever we had, you know, but we fill up the 

stomach, you know, and ma tter of fact I I gain
ed some  pounds, you know, in that cell. On 
August 1st, on the evening, I reme mber, 
again the _____, you know, that tall guy, the 
guard come  with the pink sheets and says Ju
lius Noga. Sign this here. We  already know 
pink sheets what means...concentration camp. 
I said so I says OK Herr Wachmeister, 
when?  Tomorrow?  Yeah, tomorrow you go Flossenberg. And we hear some thing about 

Flossenberg, that that's  supposed to be t
ough concentration camp. I 
thought they going to 
send me  in Mauthausen. No, but for some  r
eason they send me  in Flossenberg. So next 
day, OK. They pick up...I  believe there was 
forty-six of us. I was the only one Pole, 
Polish guy in this transport. They cuff our hands two and two, and they bring us down to 

the garage down below and they  put us on a 
bus without a top, that bus what they usually 
bring the prisoners from the from the jail to 
the Gestapo building what was in a city there, 
a new building, yeah. They bring us on a rail de
pot and they put us on a on a railroad car 
and that was small comp artments you call 
it... three me n or four me n to the one 
compart ment, yeah, and two of them can sit 
and two of the m stand and then we change, 

you know. So we come  as far as Salzburg in 02:
09:  Austria. Then in Salzburg we stay 
overnight...some kind of old jail,
 big cell, all of us was la
ying there. There was some  
ma ttresses on the floor and we stay over nigh
t and this is very interesting because all 
documents in a concentration camp a nd on the Gestapo, all docume nts fr om the 

foreigners wa s destroyed, but Salzburg, that
 jail for some  reason I don't understand even 
when you go today, when you call up, they keep th
at record and says Julian Noga stay 
over night here in a on the way to concentra
tion camp to Flossenberg, and this is the only 
evidence there in Austria where is I was se
nt to concentration camp Flos senberg. I got 

some  other witnesses, but that's  what is still, you know, the the the best proof, you know, 

I was on the way to Flossenberg, so the next st
op was we stay overnight from Salzburg in  
Munich. Also in some  kind of jail, andthis what I meet...how should I say...my good 

luck. As we was there wa s late in the ev
ening. They bring a tall guy, brunette, tall guy, 
strong guy by the name  Hans Bauer (ph). Now Hans Bauer was in a German jail for ten 

years. He served his term and the and he 
was free, but the Gestapo was waiting for him 
and pick him up and put him in a concentr
ation camp like they did with all others, 
criminals were told that. So always you serv
e your term in a jail like Hans Bauer ten 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
14 
 
years, but the Gestapo, they decided, you know, 
he's too dangerous to be free so they put 
him in a concentration camp. Now he wa
s poor, that guy. He didn't have nothing and 
happen when I was there in Linz on Cell Five some  of those guys will clean up on the 
Gestapo there and pick up the cigarettes
, you know, butts, you 
know. We  had plenty 
tobacco and we...those newcomers come and th
ey had some  cigarettes and from the 
office we had one guard so he bring the ci
garettes on the cell, 
you know, because what 
you say black ma rketing was when going all over,
 so I had plenty cigarettes and I had a 
nice bag of tobacco, so I give...he was a hea
vy smoker that Hans Bower. I give him one 
pack of cigarettes and he was appreciate it so 
much and he says what is your name . I says  
Julius, because they usua lly ca ll me  Julius. OK. I reme mber this. Now what it was soon 

after we come  to the concentration camp, but 
before we come  to that, now then from 
Munich we go to a little town, 
the last 02:13:  railroad station 
by the name  Floss (ph). It is 
close to the concentration camp Flos senburg. No
w there the SS with the black vans, they 

was waiting for us. And how they greet us wh
en we step out from the train...with the 

whips, the long whips and they call us all kind 
of na me s. Lauese (ph), lice...and they pack 
us, you know, in that black vans there and s
hut the door and we wa
s standing so packed, 
you know. And we come to the concentrati
on camp and whe n they open the door, you 
couldn't see nothing when we was...and that 
was probably from Floss to concentration 
camp wasn't  that far...was ma ybe three kilome te
r, not more than five kilometer and here 
they open the door and we looking around. We  
had not muc h time. My gosh...we see the 
watch towers and the wires and those guards th
ere, and and right away they put us in a 
washroom which was few stairs
...I don't know...about five, six 
stairs down. They put us 
there and they push us and they 
hit us with the whips and that's  when we t a ke the clothes 
off and they give us nice cold shower. Of 
course, that was summer. That was beginning 
of the August, but (laughter) you take a really 
cold shower, you feel 
it, and they put the 
hose, you know, they had a big hose with the 
water. They put the hose, you know, just 
like the animals, you know. OK. And they give
 us the striped suit what I going to show 
you later on, but some  are striped white and bl
ue, thin. Thin fa bric. Yeah. OK. And then 
they bring us on a on a newcomer so-called, ne
w- come rs barrack and they keep us there  
for fourteen days, for two weeks. The only 
thing they didn't give
 us the shoes those 
fourteen days and every day in the morni
ng they call us to th
e Politische Abteilung, 
means to the political bureau, and they ask us...everyone of us...you know, one by one, all 
questions, you know...where you was born, wher
e, how, this, how come , how you come  
over here, and they had this 
all reported. But they ask you, s
ee. Then I reme mber just a 
short ...I give you example. There was a guy as
king question. Ah he was not even high 
officer. He was some  ki nd of like a corporal, 
SS, and he was sitting on a table, you know, 
and play with the feet, you know...he look at
 me . He asked me  question like this...you 

know why you are here? I says yeah. Why?  We
ll, because I was too close friend to the 
Austrian girl. He laugh at me  and he says
 no. You here to pay for those all German 
soldiers was killed in in a in a city by
 the name  Bedgost??  in Poland. I know that's  
02:16:20  later on I find out because I aske
d so ma ny people why, why, why he ask me  
questions. Be dgost. Who is ____?  I know that 
_____ they had a big factories, clothing 
factories, some thing like that. I don't even
 know where is ____ you know. Far away from 
from Tarnow. I says sir, I never was in 
Bedgost_. What?  Macht nichts. But you pay for 
those German soldiers was killed in Bedgost.
 Now after I find out, yes. There was a ____. 
Even before the war start, there was so
 many Germans  living there in the ____ and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
15 
 
Germans started it. Whe n the people come  
out of the church, you know, there was some  
shooting, you know, some thing like that, so 
the Polish people go after, after those 
German and after the Germans come, the 
soldiers, you know...that was some thing very 
unusual and that's what he probably was th
ere and he reme mbered
 this and that's  
probably...that's what he told me . OK, sir, 
if you say so...fine. OK. Raus. He chased me  
out and good thing he no even slap me , you kno
w. But other guys, some  of them, he beat. 
He kick, you know. Mean, mean ba stard, you know. Oh me an, mean. So what we was 

doing after that...OK. After they asked...so 
they had a kapo. Kapo was like a forema n. 
Kapo come s from an Italian word, language...ka
po, which me ans forema n. He had a long 
whip and he let us run five...five me n in one
 row. How ma ny was there? Oh gosh...I don't 

know. Maybe fifty, ma ybe hundred. He let us ru
n, run there, on Appellplatz which me ans 
the roll call square, in a mead
ow, and there was no blacktop. There was just a like a 
rough gravel. Pretty smooth but not too 
smooth, and you ima gine...no shoes. And we 
had...we had to run all wa y around, you know, and 
he play with us, you know. He hit us  
with the things you know. So they keep us for 
fourteen days and teach us all those rules 
in a concentration camp and the best thing 
what they tell us, you know, one of the 
guy...he was a prisoner, a German prisoner, criminal, the kapo. I reme mb er his number. 

He had a green triangle and his number was 
very low...number 14. And I think his name  
was Paul. Big ma n. He say now while you are 
here, you're going to work twelve hours. 
See that quarry over there. 
You're going to work in th
at quarry. Most of you. Twelve 
hours a day. Here is the eighth what you call 
commandment of the concentration camp. I 
forgot how you name  it, you know, but those you know, you you got to work. You got to 

be good, you know. You got to listen this and this and 02:20:  this. And if you not listen 
to this, for stealing, stealing br
ead was death sentence. For th
e little thing you get twenty-
five whips on your rear end. And then he sa
ys oh yes, you can go free from this. Of 

course, you go...you had the on the entrance you 
had that writing arbeit ma ch frei 
(ph)...just the baloney, you know. Nobody go free th
ere. He says but yes, you can go free. 
You see that chimney on the crematorium th
ere?  That's  the way you go to freedom. So I 
thought my gosh...and you look at those all wires, double wires. You know, the first first 

was I don't know...three, four me ter high, barbed
 wire and on the bottom t here was a big 
rows you know, the barbed wire. And the sec
ond one probably oh about thirty inches, 
three foot. There was the electric wires. Smoot
h electric wire, pretty
 close together. Fi ve 
thousand volts, so if you touch it, you bur
n, and I saw that too, you know, what can 
happen when the person start turn blue 
and black, you know. OK. Thanks  God...my gosh, 
you know, now that's  the life supposed to be so 
I start...somehow I st
art thinking now it's  
going to be impossible. I got to prepare myself
 to commit suicide. OK. So after fourteen 
days they one morning...oh, by by the way...you ge
t up four o'clock...four thirty in the 

morning. That's get up. Aufstehen, you know. Hear the whistle some where. Aufstehen 

some body s c reamed some where. Then you got to get up fast, ma ke your bed, go in the 

washroom, t a ke your shirts off up to here, 
wash yourselves and 
ma ke ready and go out. 
Go out by the barrack and the block ma n...bl
ock man...that's t he German prisoner. He 
was responsible for the bloc
k, for the barrack, barrack. 
He count you. There on the SS 
fuehrer, block fuehrer you called it...one of th
e SS take care of the...for instance, by block 
was number nine. He come  and the block ma
n make a report to him, so many men go 
ready go to work, so ma ny me n is sick, so 
ma ny die over night. We  say four, five, six 
me n die over the night, so he ma ke this repo
rt. OK. Then the block nine was way high as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
16 
 
you go...in the mi ddle the blocks was on both 
sides and there was hundred two stairs. 
There was few steps and there was a level gr
ound and there was one barrack on one side 
and the other one on the other side, and ag
ain few steps up and two barracks and a few 
steps up, so I was pretty block nine on the 
right hand side was I think second or third 
before the last one on the right hand side, 
so when you looked from block nine, when you 
looked down to the square, to the roll call,
 you see everything. You see the cremation 
building, you know. I had a very few view from
 block nine, so OK. So aft e r fourteen 
days they took us early in the morning and they
 bring us to the 02:24:  quarry. They give 
us shoes too, with the wooden sole and that's why I got the or iginal pictur e because as I 

show here and I going to leav
e that pictur e, my pictur e from the first day in the 
concentration camp hangs there today in a mu
seum in Flossunberg and this is a big 
for mat of the picture, so when I was ther
e two years ago, when I saw myself on that 
picture, I thought I going to faint. My legs 
go down and I call my wife. My wife was with 
me , my daughter, my son and I show them 
that, so that was something...excuse me...and I 
reme mber exactly that time when that pictur
e was taken. It was the first day in a quarry 
and that was at noon when we get the soup. We  was waiting for the soup. You're going to 

see that picture. We  are going to show later 
on, and there was a little SS, red hair with a 
big black came ra like a like an accordion I 
should say (laughter). And why I reme mbe r  so 
good because we was joking from that guy. How come  they pick him up for the SS 

because usua lly when they pick up a ma n for 
the SS they got to be tall...you got to be 
perfect, see. But some how (laughter) they pi
ck him up. He wa s a little guy, red hair. 
Anyway, he ma ke that picture and I reme mber
 that day and that picture was ma de as I 
can reme mb er as I come  to Flossenburg on August 3rd, and fourteen days they keep us 

there. It must be around August 18, 19 or ma
ybe  20th that picture was ma de. How this 
picture survived, how they get it, how they 
put it there, I don't know. But I'm there see, 
and then on a in a quarry they put me  
in a special gang, so-called Kette Kommando. 
Kette Kommando was was a gang...I can't  reme
mber...was four of us, six of us, few 

gangs like that...our job was goi
ng in a quarry way deep with
 a dynamite that granite 
night before, and those big blocks granite...w
e put the chain around and the big crane was 
on top of it. He pick up those big blocks and 
bring on a level and then
 those blocks, they 
was cut again for the smaller 
pieces. So I was there for few weeks and that was very 
dangerous. Some time t he whole block slip
ped, you know. We didn't put the chain right, 
you know, some how, and there were so ma ny ac ci
dents there. That was that was very 
danger(ous). Now why I say this pi cture was ma
de in a first da y in a quarry. Because on 
that picture I got the shoes with the woode
n sole and after a while I was assigned for 
those Kette Kommando...put the 
chains on...what was so muc h climbing, they give me  
leather shoes very next day, and that's why I I 
reme mber that that was the fi rst day in a in 
a quarry. OK. So after a few weeks they...for some  reason one morning they put me  on a 

barrack...they take me  off from this 
kommando. We call it 
kommando...you know, the 
gang. And they put me  on on cell number 12 to 
learn how to work out
 and ma ke pieces 
out of the granite, so my fi
rst teacher there was another prisoner, old prisoner, a 
Czechoslovak. I reme mb er his name . Very ni
ce ma n. Franco Cerevani_ and he teach me  
how there do this granite. What we was doi
ng we was ma king the stone for the corpse, 
for the sidewalks and for the kilome ter posts
, for the streets those... in Germany you got 
though ma de out of the granite, little s
quares, you know. Wh en you see some time those 

streets in Germany ma de  out of the granit
e, you know in diffe rent designs, see...those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
17 
 
kind of squares we was ma king and also we
 was ma king stones for the buildings. For 
instance, ma ny buildings in Germany, they'r e 
ma de out of granite. Matter of fact the 
Politische Abteilung building there, later on we pu
t there. Pol. Abt. m
eans the all political 
bureaus was there, the whole concentration 
camp commandant, wheels...they had offices 
there, and matter of fact I got my probably...I 
can't re me mber exactly...four or five stones 
underneath the roof and they'r e in a shape like used to call them cocquils...special ma de. 

They stick out on the ____ roof and they
'r e in a shape like half-rounded, you know, and 
two years ago I was there and I show my 
wife, my daughtera
nd my son, look...I don't 
know which one but I know this is four or five
 of them, those stones, I ma ke it, see. And 
also we was ma king stones for the bridges. That time they build up the autostrada 

(ph)...the big way you call it...and by each bridge
 on the side, those walls, they was us ing 

those big blocks. We ...t here there wa s a name Soldaten St eine. Yeah. That's the name  

was, and that's what the work was. First 
few 02:30:30   weeks that was terrible, you 
know. I thought I not going to ma ke it s
ee. My hand...you...that was all hand-work, you 
know. Point chisel and s flat ch
isel, you know, ________, _________, (tools in 
German)________ and ma sh (ph) hammer 
number one, number two, you know. You 
smooth it up with the with the ma sh hammer. So you start with number one what is 

rough, see, and you pound and pound and you got the brush, you know, and you brush 

that dust. There was no fan, nothing. In th
e evening after twelve hours when we'r e 
finished, we was full white, you know, like a bakers. Remi nd me  in a bakery, you know, I 

wasn't  that much white that time. And the
n...now if you ma ke that stone, each stone had it 

own term, you know...how long takes it to ma ke
. If you ma ke that stone on on time, you 
have extra bonus. We  say in a week, 
one ma rk, two ma rk bonus, so you can buy 
some thing in the canteen. They had a canteen
 in a concentration 
camp, so after after a 
few weeks I pick up because friend of mi ne to
ld me, look Julie, if you want to survive, 
you got to show them some thing what 
you can do and don't go down. If you go down, 
you come  to the stage of mussulman...wha
t we call mussul man, mussulman...they going 
to kick you. They going to kill you. You're gonna swell up. You going to die he said. All 
the prisoners told me  that, you know. So I 
really pay attention and thanks God by gosh, 
some how I I did my work the best and I fini
shed some  of those stones most of them on 
time, getting better and better and I become professional stone cutter, and that's probably 

was one reason...as a good stone cutter, 
you know, as a low number...1623, those kapos 
they some how some how they they like 
you, you know. They  kick you any time, you 

know, but no respect, you know. He 's a good stone cutter. He 's  got low low number, you 

know, so some ti me  they skip you. They no kick you, you know. But that doesn't  mean  

(laughter) you're safe. OK. So you know, mi
ght want to know how what  kind of a life 
was in a concentration camp. You hear so ma
ny stories. Wha t  should I say?  Gosh, that 
was mi serable. No ma tter what I going to 
tell you, you probably...half of that you're not 
going to believe it because I tell you the truth. 
If I think back right now, if I think, you 
know, it's hard for me  to believe, you know, how
 this possible could be how I survived. 
Yeah. And there is so many, so ma ny bad th
ings happen in Fl ossenburg. The life, daily 
life was terrible. You get up four thirty...quick, quick, quick, quick. And go to the quarry, 

work twelve hours, six days a week, tw
elve hours a day. Sunday...Sunday before noon we 
do the chores, so called, you know...clean out 
the your lockers, clean out the barrack, 
clean up yourselves and everything. Then 
we had inspection, you know. If you had 
button mi ssing or some thing like that, you was 
punished for that, see. So it was clean. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
18 
 
That time from the beginning was clean, I mu
st say. Yes. Oh...they cut our hair every 
month, and every week they cut with the 
clippers in the mi ddle, you know. Yeah. And 
then you work 12 hours a day. The food was not 
to survive no matte
r how strong you are 
for six mont hs, you know. The stronger people I saw,
 in a six months they die. Like in the 
morning you get only half a liter, what you ca
ll a liter, black coff
ee, ersatz coffee so-
called, ma de  out of a bark, burnt bark. Then
 when you was working in a quarry, around 
nine o'clock they give you tw
o slices of bread with ma rgar
ine, as a heavy worker. Yeah. 
At noon, as you see on this picture what I got
, we had  soup. Soup. Cabbage, red cabbage. 
I thought I never going to eat red cabbage in 
my life. Spinach. Spinach. Spinach...I says 
my gosh, spinach again, and that was watered, you know. There was no fat to it, see. So I 
thought as long as I going to live I never ea
t spinach. But I tell you some thing. I like 
spinach, Once in a while (laughter) I eat sp
inach. Yeah. And then 
after you come  from 
the work here on the roll call square, th
ey count you again and son of a gun...you know, 
every day some body was mi ssing. No ma tter what
. And they count and count and count  
till they find out what happen. What would ha
ppen some ti me  guy die or was killed in a in 
a quarry. Many of them was killed and they forgot
 to to take his name  off, so they find 
out  in a...we had a hospital. We  called it 
ambulance. They find out the guy is in the 
ambulance or they find out he is on a pile 
there by the crematorium, you know, but it's 
happened, many times happen some body want 
to try run away, and that was death 
sentence. My gosh. Yes. Don't you try to 
do that. If you try th
at, you...but I know, I know 
at least three guys..they run away and they
 didn't catch them. Why they didn't catch 

them?  Because anybody run away, either death or
 life, they bring them ba ck right in the 
mi ddle in in that square. They put them 
there and says look, we  we caught him. And 

when you people want to run away, we'll bri
ng you back like that, you know. That's  was, 
you 02:38:  know, the lessons, you know, for for 
this. So the worst...one of the guy from 
this ___...this is very interesting...there 
was a Ukrainian guy. He was s mart on one hand 
but he wasn't  so smart on the other hand. What he did when we was working in a 

quarry...I ma ke the st ory short, we had some  
civilian bosses there. Usually those guys set 
the dynamite there in the evening, and those 
civilian bosses, they had some  kind of s uit 
which you call uniform or or...there's a name
 for  it, you know...the pants and the all 
together. At noon...that's right...at noon the the 
boss hang out this suit in his shack, and 
that Ukrainian guy sneak in and put that on a
nd put his cap and he go 
on a side there there 
was a small gate, yeah. And the guard salute 
to him, you know, and he let him go, and he 
go only about thirty kilome ter. We  fi nd out 
after he go about thirty kilometer and he 
come  to the far m and he says, he told the farm
er he just come  from the Ukraine. He start 
on a station...he don't know what station and he 
want to drink the water. He was thirsty, 
and the train go away and he lost everything, 
you know. He lost the paper. He lost the 
suitcase. He had a suit over there and ev
erything, you know. The farmer need a worker. 
He says don't worry about that. You know, that
 guy is a Geme inde Buergermeister, he's 
friend of mi ne. I ma ke a paper for you, so he ma ke a paper for him, you know, and 

everything, even the clothes you know...was 
everything alright. Now three months 
after...I don't know, not even three months...he
 was too fresh and for some  reason that 
far mer was fresh too, and the farmer hit him a
nd he hit the farmer back, so he call up...the 
far mer call up the Gestapo. The Gestapo 
come . Ah...yeah...he had a different name  
already, but listen. What a coincidence. So
 Gestapo keep him there and give him good, 
you know, and this and now we 'r e going to se
nd you to the concentration camp. Would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
19 
 
you believe where they send him...to the Fl
ossenburg. There is now...that be alright. 
Nobody would know nothing, but afte
r fourteen days as a newcomers, they sent him to 
the quarry and they sent him to the same
 gang where he was before and the kapo 
recognize him and he call up the camp and two SS 
come  with the with the rifle, with the 
bayonet, and they bring him over there. So in
 the evening when we come , when we come  
to the camp, he was standing there by the pole 
in the center and he ha
d a big sign in three 
languages...I think that wa s in German, in Po
lish and in Russian...Ich bin wieder da. That 

means I come back. Yeah. OK. So they keep hi
m for a few da ys in a jail. We had a jail, 
bunker  we called it. See. They keep him ther
e for a  few da ys, and one evening we come  
back from the work...usually they ma ke
 a show...almost every week they hang 
some body...and here they carried...we had a
...they had (laughter) 
portable gallow, 
gallows. Portable. Two me n carry them, you 
know. They bring the gallows. Nothing 
new...we know. Every week they bring th
e gallows...you know, they hang some body and 
they hang that Ukrainian fe llow. Now when
 they hang the guy, no ma tter winter or 
summer, he had only pants. Barefoot. No sh
irts, nothing, and the hands wa s tied in the 
back. They bring that guy and we find 
out who that guy was. Now that was the 
unforgettable mo ment. I saw so ma ny people was hanged there and feel sorry for them 

you know, but for this guy particular I feel so
rry be...because this is a unbelieva ble stor y, 
so they put him on the  gallows. There was...t
he gallows was a box with the floor cut in 
the mi ddle and there was a handle on the side
. Wh en the guy pull out that handle so the 
floor goes in, you know, and the guy fall in that
 box and and was hanged. And that's  what 
they do to that Ukrainian fellow. First they 
read the verdict, you know. The verdict, and 
no ma tter what it was, they always saysfor the sabotage. Everything for them was 

sabotage. So what they did...and we stood there, everybody still, you know. You got to 

stay there and and watch it, see, and they 
pull out the handle and th
e guy fall in that box 
and would you believe the rope breaks. The the the the rope broke. Now some body t old 
me  because we got all kind of people in a concentration 02:43:        camp...lawyers and 
judges, you know...that was an international law...I
'm not sure about that
 but they tell us, 
if the rope break when they hang some body, the  ma n supposed to go free. Those 
criminals...they ma ke a knot, you know...they put th
at rope together a
nd they hanged that 
guy second time  and he was crying. He was
...he was begging them...he 's going to be 
good worker. Just keep me  in this concentration camp. They hang him second time, and 

that was the worst thing.  
 

Q: Can we go focus a little bit more on some  
of the things that happened to you while you 
worked in the camp...some of the situations 
that that you were the victim of while you 
were at Flossenburg? 
 

A: Well, yes. Li ke for instance this was...I 
think that was well, I was working in a in a 
quarry, as I tell you before and what happene
d to me  and forgot about think to me  
personally, once I was sent to the kommando...i
n a in a concentration camp kommando 
means gang...and we was pushing a wagon on 
a small tracks with the dirt, you know. 
They was building some thing, another barrack
 or some thing, and on that job I had a 
different forema n and he  hit me  with the stic
k over the head and he 
split...I still got the 
got the scars over here. He split my head, and I was...he was a German forema n, and I 

was so furious I don't care what happ...what's 
going to happen. I take
 the stick from him 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171  
20 
 
and I hit him so hard so the blood come  from the ears, you know, from him, and they 
catch me, the kapos, the other kapos catch 
me  and there they give me  a...oh my gosh. 
They beat me so bad on there in the quarry 
and they bring me  to the first aid in the 
quarry, and again the Hans Bauer find out a
bout that because that was some thing, you 
know, that the the Polish guy hit the hit th
e German fore ma n, you know. That was death 
sentence right there. I didn't care, you 
know. He hit me  for nothing, you know, you know, 
and I was so ma d I didn't know what I doi
ng, you know. That was my reaction, and the 
Hans Bauer...at that time , you know, he saved 
me . He grabbed that forema n and he says 
if anything ha ppen to this guy, I going to kill 
you. So he said, because he says that guy...I 

had a knife. Knife...this is death sentence, you know. You...besides the hankerchief, you 

not supposed to have nothing on a...in a qua
rry, just a hankerchief
. And a and the dish 
what you was eating and a spoon...that's all. Y
eah. So that was...that was some thing, you 
know, that Hans Bower saved me  right there,
 you know. The second time  why I got that 
number on my arm, four. Up today I can't  e
xplain how this happened and what they had 

in mi nd, what they want to do with me . Ther
e was a group of us. There was some  officers 
come  and we find out they was from Auschwitz, Oswiecem, and they pick up so ma ny 

prisoners and happen, you know, they pick me  up 
too. First of all, we
 have to take the 
shirts off and they put my 1623 with the red chalk (ph) on my on my chest. Then they 

took us to the extra barrack there and th
ey tatooed our our numbers, you know, like I 

have 1623. Well in Flossenburg we had no num
bers, you know, and we was ready to go 
for the transport, and we find out for Au
schwitz, _____. And I don't know why they tatoo 
us there. Then we was ready to ma rch to th
e to the truck...there wa
s several trucks, you 
know, pick us up and bring us on a on a 
railroad depot. Again Hans Bauer come s 
some where, and he check up...he was al
ready...he was alread
y big wheel in a 
concentration camp, so-called you know...big wheel
. He was lageraeltester number two at 
the...yeah. And he look at me . He recognize me . 
He look at me  and he go to the officer. 
He say some thing to that officer and 
then he come  back and he says ___________1623 
austreten, and he pull me  out, and he says 
go on your barrack quick. And he saved me  
that time. Yeah. What can I tell you my pe
rsonal...that was hard. Many times come s, you 
know, I was ready to commit suicide because I 
didn't believe  what they was doing, what I 
saw every day would happen in the quarries, 
how ma ny people die in the quarries, how 
ma ny peopl e they kill, fr om nowheres, and I 
tell you after that  what they lay out the 
bomb for Hi tler, you know, in the bunker, you know...they want to kill Hitler. You want 

to see how ma ny Ger mans, officers, all kind 
of me n, they bring to the Flossenburg. And 
they kill them right there.
 What it wa s today people look for other people they 
disappeared during the war, 
during the war. They don't know
 how they disappeared.  
 

Q: I'd like to stay back on on where you...wha
t was happening to you at this time. After 
Hans Bauer saved you from the transport... 
 

A: Hedid. 

 

Q: ...what events occurred while
 you were still at Flossenberg? 
 

A: OK. I still wa s working in a quarry, do my 
stones, and till April 20th. On April 20th, the 
the concentration camp was evacuated from 
Flossenburg to Dachau, so you want to know

some  more about the concentration camp.My gosh. You know, you hear so ma ny stories 
there. Unforgettable. OK. I give you another 
example, what I witnesses and what bothers 
me ... 
 

Q: You? 

 

A: What happened to me ?  No. What I saw. Wh
at I saw. Now we  had a very interesting 
Christma s Eve in a concentration camp. Ev
ery year they put us...they put the big 
Christmas tree by the entrance and that eveni
ng when we come from work, there was a 
gallows hand-made... long log was and five loops and they hang up five me n on the front 

of that Christma s tree, and they had a guard
s...yeah...nice present isn't it?  And the offi cer 
that report officer had the guards to co
me  wish you Merry Christma s and Happy New 
Year and we wish you be free in the next year. We  couldn't put this together, you see. 

And that's...this is some thing unforgetta
ble...unforgettable for me . There was a 
time...there was a time it did help me . You 
know ma ny peopl e ask me  how I survived. It 

did help me , because that time when I was arrested I had three hundred eighty ma rks. 

That was a lot of money though. I was doing 
a little bit black business before I was 
arrested, you know. I'd buy some thing like sh
oes, you know. I had a a place where I can 
buy shoes, you know. I buy them for ten ma rks. 
I used to sell them for twenty ma rks, you 
know, for other people, you know, because th
at time  was everything, you 02:51:30  
know, you have to have Bezugschein card, you 
know, to buy anything, you know. So I I I 
saved quite a money. I had about three hundr
ed eighty marks that time when I was 
arrested, and that money from the Gestapo 
to the concentration camp was follow me , and 

they deposited that money and that was hone
st, you know, at least that much honest. I'm 
surprised. So from that money I can wiggle
...every week, anytime, I can wiggle some  
money. I give you, for instance, like how 
much you pay, how much I pay for the 
cigarettes. Cigarettes was very important. H
undred cigarettes was only two ma rks. For 
the cigarettes you can buy everything, youknow. You can buy bread. You can buy soup. 

You can buy anything, you know, and that help
s me  to survive, you know. I tell about 
myself now. 
 

Q: Tell me  about how...what happened to you dur
ing the evacuation?  Y
our your evacuation 
from Flossenburg. 
 

A: That was the worst experience for for all be
cause I thought this going to be the end. They 
no let us...they no let us live
 through and be witness like t
oday so I can tell to everybody 
what happened, see. So we we we believed they going to liquidate us. OK. That was on 

Friday, April 20th in Fl ossenburg. Maybe I s
hould go a little bit b
ack, thirteen days. 
There was a one night the guards and the SS le
ft the concentration camp and we was free. 
Let's see...that was about a week or a little be
ttter than a week befo
re the evacuation, so 
one day, one night, we was free. We  alrea
dy put the flags, white flags you know...we 
surrendered, you know, please. American planes 
come . They ma ke a picture. They circle 

there. We  was free. But just don't run away. 
Don't  go nowheres, because in the woods all 
over there wa s so ma ny  German sol dier, you know, so anybody can shoot you. But that 

was short freedom, see...over the night. We  get up in the morning and here you got the 

same thing...all the guards and even worse b
ecause they had new guards from the front, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171

SS, and they was very cruel, you know,
 and they start shooting, you know, anybody, you 
know. If they no like you, they shoot. OK. So we was we was there for one week like 
that. Then they was talking about the evacuat
ion, so OK. On April 20th, six o'clock in the 
morning, they start evacuati
ng two thousand me n...that wa
s probably about close to 
sixteen thousand prisoners that
 time . Now three years ago when I when I come  to the 
concentration camp, that Flossenburg was not
 more than two thousand, not even two 
thousand. So by the end there was about sixteen
 thousand because we had some  prisoners 
from Gross Rosen comi ng. OK. The y start ev
acuate us on that day, April 20th. OK. So 
the tricky wa s for me  and few other my frie
nd of mi ne, hiding and stay as long as 
possible in the camp because the American 3r
d Ar my was so close already. You can hear 
them...you c a n hear the shots you know, machine 
gun, so we'r e going to stay as as as long 
as possible in the camp, but come s about five
 o'clock afternoon. The last column was 
called and many people fa ll on a...they they 
want to be sick, you know...they don't want 
to go, and they start shooti
ng, you know. Get up or death, you know, or they shoot you. 
So ma ny people get up, you know, and theyform...I don't know...was it two thousand, 

close to two thousand. Yeah. Then we ma rc
h. We 'r e ma rched and how sneaky they are. 

They bring us to the woods, you know...side roads, you know, through the woods, thick 

woods, you know, we was ma rching. They didn't gi
ve us nothing to eat. Nothing to eat. 

That was Friday. Saturday, nothing to eat, and 
soon we just left to the concentration 
camp. We come  to that woods. We  see ther
e's so ma ny dead people laying on both sides 
from previous columns, you know. Those pr
evious...there was eight columns, two 
thousand each, you know, before us. All day, you know, and you see those dead people, 

so that was the worst thing. 
First of all, soon you get so tired, you know, to walk and no 
water, no bread, nothing. On Sunday we had to
 stop... we had to stop and they give us a 
little, little pi ece...fift
een decagram of bread. No water. No coffee. Nothing, and that's all 
what we had. Now each each morning...oh let's say around four o'clock, they bring us in 
the woods and  let us rest for two, thr
ee hours the most, you know and by gosh that was 
good, but so ma ny people couldn't get up, you know
. They was exhausted, so they was 
shot. They were shot, and as we ma rch 
to Dachau, if some body was walking, you know, 
like, you know, wobbles, the guard come  to
 that guy, push him on the side and close 
range shoot him with the rifle.
 Shoot him in the head. It wa
s terrible picture. So I give 
you exampl e. From Friday till Monday noon, about four thousand prisoners from those 
columns wa s shot and I was...that last da
y I was ready to lay down and OK...shoot me  

because, you know, it was impossible, almost im
possible. So and we was not even half 
way to the to the Dachau concentration 
camp. We was free on Monday, twelve o'clock. 
On my gosh...at noon. The first Ame r ican ta
nk come  with the white star. That was 
emotional. Would you believe...oh...then we  have to lay down, you know. Some body 

give us the...some body give us the order tolay down, and some of those guards want to 

run away but they was stopped by by those machine guns, American Army . Third 

Ar my...General George Patton, th
e best ma n. God give him heaven. So after we get up, 

the first thing what we was running to the Am
erican tanks and we 
kissed those tanks. We 
hugged...we squeezed those American soldier. We
 kissed them shoes and we thank them 
for the freedom. That was unforgettable. Th
at was some thing. That was the biggest 
mome nt, and during those not qui
te four days, four thousand 
was shot and then we'll go 
back just a little while...a little
 back where we...there was a li
ttle town there, Stansriedt 
(ph) by the name  there...not far away from ____
 city, and we stayed there for...privately 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0171

for two weeks and the Americans ma ke a kitc
hen for us and we had plenty food and we 
stayed there and after three w
eeks the Americans give me  the special paper, pass and they 
give me  bicycle and I go back to Austria. 
I was thinking to see Frieda. And  there's so 
much to say what happened in a concentr
ation camp, but by gosh, you know, the cruelty, 
unbelievable cruelty. So ma ny peopl e knows so
 ma ny peopl e not believe that's  happen. 
Last week one lady call me  and says  you wa
s in a concentration camp. I don't believe 
you. There was not such a thing. Yeah. So after that... 
 
Q: I have to stop right now
. We 'r e out of tape. Thank you.
