Q: You were the youngest, born inVi enna? 

 

A: Born inVi enna. And inVi enna, my  father la
ter on, he had a store on a 
main street, like, it was 
like it was a pharmacy but he 
didn™t have prescriptions. 
 

Q: Like anAmerican drug store? 

 

A: Ye s, on a main street inVi enna. The street was called Berginger St rasse. 

 

Q: Berginger? 

 

A: When I was a teenager, I worked in the store an
d my sister worked there too. We  were selling 
things. And it was a very busy street.The reason I tell you this because when the Nazis came to 

Vi enna, when they ma rched in, all the soldiers th
ey ma rched on the street and they came  to our  

store, a few of the German soldiers came  to our
 store and they wanted to buy razor blades and 
they looked at my sister, they looked at me  and 
t hey said ﬁare you Jewish? ﬂ  and we said yes. 
And they screamed at us ﬁdon™t you know we ar
en™t  allowed to buy by Jewsﬂ and they walked 
out. 
 

Q: Withoutbuying? 

 

A: Oh, yes, without buying anything. 

 

Q: Did they take?   Di
d they take anything? 
 

A: No, they didn™t take.  But it was my first 
encounter with the Nazis passing me and soon 
afterwards the people were standing outside our 
store and they wrote down
 in big yellow letters 
ﬁJudeﬂ and they wouldn™t let anybody come  in our st
ore. They blockaded it. And a fe w months  
later, the SS me n ca me  in our store and we had to
 walk out he said and we were not allowed to 
take the cash or anything from our store.  My sist
er and I were there and we had to just walk out 
and leave everythi ng behi nd. We  had no 
more rights because we were Jews. 
 

Q: So this was a few months after the______________? 

 

A: Ye s, a few months after. 

 

Q: And you lost the store? 

 

A: Oh, yes, we lost the store and everything. 
We never saw it anymore. We c ouldn™t take 
a_____________ out or anything,, the cash register, nothing. 
We just had to walk out.  It was 
one of our first experiences. We  didn™t know ho
w bad it was going to be
 but everybody tried to 
escape.  Only Jewish people went to escape el
sewhere. And everybody tried another way. And 
my brother gave me  advice and told me , w
hy don™t you look in the ph
one book and write to 
some  people and they will sponsor us because no country would let you in anymore. We could 

leaveVi enna if anybody would let 
you in but no country wanted to 
leave the refugees
 in.  So we  
took a English phone book and I wr ote five name s  from
 the alphabet. The first five names.  I  
wrote toAbbot was his name Abbot  and four more
 name s and my sister wrote to a fe w B™s and 
her name  was Bell. And a few wee ks later, I 
got an answer from a ma n name dAbbot and my  
sister from the name  Be nn and he said he would 
sponsor us and be able 
to help a huma n life. 
And he wrote all the documents and this is the 
way I came to England. And he was a complete 
stranger.  It was in 1939. And when I came to Engl
and, he was a furrier and right in the heart of 
Oldgate he was situated. And I went to thank h
im and we were not allowed to take any money,  
of course, only 30 shillings we were allowed to
 take fromVi enna and we were not supposed 
to_______________ in England because he guarant eed for us but he asked me and 

asked_____________ of course, because no money or nothing, and asked, can you keep a 

needle in your hand. And are you 
good at sewing and I say of cour
se.  So he gave me  a job off 
the books.  He paid me  in cash 
and I was sewing and I was happy and I had a job there in his 
factory.  I wa s sewing lining in fu
r coats and he was very nice.  He 
save my life. And my sister. 
She was ma rried at that time. 
 

Q: InAustria? 

 

A: InAustria. And she went, her sponsor was a 
judge in Scotland.  His name  was Bell.  He was  

not Jewish. 
 
Q: Wa s your sponsor Jewish? 

 

A: My sponsor was Jewish, yes.  He was not Jewi
sh, he was a judge. And he  was very well off and 
they were so good to my sister and her husband. 
They had a beautiful house there in Scotland 

and with butlers and they treated them wonderful
.  But after a few months, the war broke out in 
the meantime, my sister and her husband went to
 London. And after the war, it was easier. You 
got a permit.  My brother in law got a job 
with___________ some thing, officer, he was a lawyer 
inVi enna and when the Nazis came toVi enna, he 
had a car and in the firs
t week they took away 
his car. And they took away everything from the  Jews. 
 

Q: We re you interned in England, when the war broke out? 

 

A: Oh, no. The y didn™t intern us, no. 

 

Q: So you got a work permi t  and you were able to work legally, after the wa r? 

 

A: Duringthewar. 

 

Q: After the war broke out. 

 

A: In London, it was very bad when the war br
oke out.  Bombs were falling and everybody was 
running to the shelters. And everybody tried to sa
ve your life. And the  district where my job 
was where Mr.Abbot was, it was all bombed w
ith incendiary bombs and overnight and over 
weekends, everything was on fire, it was right 
in the heart of London. And I we nt to the 
country to escape, you know.  I was working in
 a factory and was sewing goggles for the army. 
 

Q: You spent the entire war in England? 

 

A: In England.  I lived in England for 13 years.
  My sister too.  I wa
s married in England, my  
daughter was born but my husband died when sh
e was a baby.  I took her to the nursery and 
everything.  I got another job in Lond
on. This was already after the war. 
 

Q: You ma rried an Englishman?   Lipton? 

 

A: Ye s.  My brother was still inVi enna.  He was three years – 

 

Q: I was going to ask about your brother.  
You had a sponsor fromAbbot, your sister was 
sponsored by Bell, what was 
your brother, did he try to? 
 

A: No, theAustrian quota, everybody was trying to 
come  toAmerica.  But theAustrian quota was 
very small and when all this happened with th
e Jews inAustria, everybody wanted to go to 
America but it was too late to be registered be
cause the quota was so small but my brother was 
lucky.  He stayed inVi enna two years afterHitler occupiedVi enna and in the meantime his  

quota was ready to go toAmerica and on the last
 boat what came fromAustria toAmerica he  
was on it and he came toAmerica. When we we
re living in England, my sister and I, my 
brother wrote to us, of course, he said what 
are you doing in England. America is the best 
country in the world so you better 
come  toAmerica.  It was in 1952. 

 
Q: When you fi nally came  toAmerica? 

 

A: When I finally came toAmerica. 

 

Q: Now, during the war, you were not 
able to correspond with your brother? 
 

A: Not during the war, no.  But after.
And we lost all contact, of c
ourse, with my mother and father 
inVi enna. And my brother, when he leftVi enna
, he saw my parents, he saw them there and my 
mother ™s brother lived with them
, one of her brother ™s lived with
 them that I told you before. 
 

Q: So your mot her ™s  brother lived
 with your mother and father? 
 

A: But I still don™t know what happened to him.  
 So far, the Red Cross couldn™t find out what 
happened to him.  I wrote, you know, all those fo
rms for them to --his name  wasAdolph Gabler. 
 

Q: When did your brother leaveAustria, do you know? 

 

A: He left just when the war broke out. 

 

Q: 1939?   Or? 

 

A: I think 1940. 

 

Q: Or the United St ates entered the war in 1941. 
 England entered the war in Se ptember of 1939. 
 
A: It must have been. 
 

Q: It was after you settled in England.  Did you 
have the work permit when your brother left 
Austria? 
 

A: I know he left on the last boat that went toAm
erica.  So it must have been -- Hitler was at war 
with England andAmerica was in 1941, so it must
 have been in 1940 before the United St ates. 
 

Q: What was it like inVi enna, when you grew up inVi enna? 

 

A: Before the war?  Oh, it was beautiful there, be
fore the war.  But the people got anti-Semitic, all 
this stuff, anti-Semitic, there, but you didn™t feel it. They didn™t let you know. But as soon as 

the Germans came, they had an easy field there. TheAustrian people welcomed them. 
 

Q: Did you have any me mo ries of going to school 
inVi enna?  What kind of school did you attend? 

 

A: Oh, yes.  I went to a co
mmercial school for four years. _____________.  I had a job there in 
Vi enna, too, in an office. 
 

Q: So you attended grade school.  Did you go to gymnasium as well?   

 

A: No. The ____________ shuler. 

 

Q: And from there you went to the _____________.  It was 
for four years.  My sister did the same . 
We  learned languages there. We  got French in 
the school and a lit
tle bit of English but when I 
came to England, I could hardly speak anywhere.  
It was terrible.  It was the biggest handicap 
when you don™t speak the language. 
 
Q: Did you have any bad experiences in school
, were there any anti-Semitic incidents?  
 

A: No, no, it was before Hitler. 

 

Q: So before Hitler came in, did you have  any anti-Semitic experience? 

 

A: No, not personally, no. 

 

Q: How your fa ther ™s  business, the store.  Did 
he have any problems be fore the time of Hitler? 

 

A: Before the time  of Hitler, no, not before the 
time. The only thing I reme mber is when you were 
Jewish, even before Hitler, you couldn™t get a 
high job like a judge or
 a professor in the 
university. They didn™t give those high jobs 
to Jews, you know big jobs for the governme nt. 
This was even before Hitler. 
 

Q: Now regarding your religious life.  How woul
d you describe your fa mily
™s  religious
 activities? 
 

A: My parents were orthodox Jewish. 

 

Q: Both? 

 
A: Bothparents. 
 

Q: From Poland and from Eisenstadt? 

 

A: Ye s. You know kosher. And my br other when 
he came toAmerica, he was also very religious. 
He ma rried a woma n, she was so religious, he 
wouldn™t pick up the phone on Saturday.  But we 
were not religious in En
gland, me  and my sister. 
 

Q: But your parents and your brother were re
ligious? And the lan
guages that you spoke. 
 

A: German.  

 

Q: German, unt il you went to school. 

 

A: Ye s, but I spoke very little.  In school I didn™t learn too much. 

 

Q: You weren™t the great student? 

 

A: I was studious but languages was a weak spot. 

 

Q: Do you recall talking about
 politics during these year
s, either with your frie
nds or your sister or 
your parents? 
 

A: I reme mber before Hitler when I was a young gi
rl, there was Shushnick and Dorfus, I reme mber  
the night when Dorfus was killed and they were
 shooting in the street s and it was like a civi l 
war, but it didn™t last too long 
and then Shushnick came and in a 
few years, Hitler came , right? 
And the _________ and I  reme mber in the most households when Hitler came, they came to 
the door (they know exactly where to find the Je
wish people, by their name  and everything, the 
Austrians) and they came to the 
door, they took all the me n away
 to the concentration camps . 
And some  of the m ca me  back and some  of the m
 went to Dachau concentration camp and some  
of them never came back.  This was in the ve
ry beginning when Hitler came. And I reme mber 
we used to live in an apartment inVi enna. 
 

Q: Do you remember the street th
at you lived in, what section? 
 

A: Ye s, sure.  Haborstrasser. 

 

Q: Haborstrasser? 

 

A: Haborstrasser.  It was in
 the second_______________, the Leiperstad
t, the most Jewish people 
lived there. 
 

Q: This was a Jewish neighborhood? 

 

A: Jewish neighborhood.  Habor
strasser, that™s  where my
 mot her used to live 
and we used to live 
when we were children. And when the Nazis ca
me  and they knocked at 
our door and it was an 
apartment building and they wanted to take my 
brother and my father. And we didn™t open the 
door and a neighbor from the sa me  floor, she came  
out, she was not Jewish. And she said ﬁwhat 
do you want from those people, they™re not at home. And they are very nice Jewish people, 
what do you want from the m.  Leave them aloneﬂ.A neighbor said that.  And they walke d  
away.  But it was first week when the Nazis o
ccupied.  But they, of course, didn™t leave the 
Jewish people alone. 
 

Q: Did you know anybody personally that was taken away by the Nazis? 

 

A: Oh, yes.  M y cousins. They took my cousins away. They took them first to Dachau.  But, the y  
let them go.  In the beginning they let some of them go, but later on it was worse. They 

wouldn™t let any Jewish people survive.  It wa
s terrible.  But the worst part was you had no 
rights anymore. You couldn™t go anywhere to complain. You c
ouldn™t go to the police or to 
anywhere. They took all your 
rights away and there was not place you could go to fight for 
your rights. This is th
e worst thing of all. 
 

Q: When you went to England, what 
kind of passport did you have?    
 

A: I had a German passport and it was written as
 Margaret Sarah. All 
the Jewish women they 
called Sarah.   
 

Q: What did they call the men? 

 

A: Israel . 

 

Q: So you had a German passport. You were no 
longerAustrian but Germa
n.  Did you have a ﬁJﬂ 

on your passport? 
 
A: Oh, yes. The ﬁJudeﬂ was the ma in thing.  It
 was the worst crime you c
ould have had, to be a 
Jude, a Jew. 
 

Q: What did your mother and father think of the Nazis? 

 

A: Oh, terrible. You know,  when
 they came for us and they had been singing in the street, ﬁJuden 
brut offen messerﬂ, terrible alwa
ys against the Jews singing thos
e words and my mother and my 
father were shaking, you know, they couldn™t believe it, suddenly we were such enemies 

without any reason.  It was terr
ible the propaganda.  Hitler, 
the speeches, I thought screaming 
like a mad man. 
 

Q: Do you remember your parents ta
lking about the Nazis before they
 came in, when they were in 
power in Germany in 1933? 
 

A: Oh yes.They said it™s terribl e.  But as terr ib
le as it was, they didn™t realize that that mad ma n 
would take the Jews and kill them like that.  
Nobody realized what really could happen because 
that never happened before in our time, if
 you reme mber.  So nobody knew he wa s sending 
them to the gas chambers when we were living th
ere.  He kept it a secret too.  I don™t know if 
you ever saw in the movies, when he takes all those Jewish people and puts them in those trains 

and the wome n, they were so vain, they want
ed to look nice, they
 took the suitcase and 
everything, they didn™t know where they were going. You saw the movie s. And as soon as they 

went, as soon as the trains arrived in the conc
entration camps, they took their luggage away and 
they were sorted out who was going to live 
a little longer and who was going to the gas  
chambers. As soon as the train arrived. Y
ou saw the movie s , those things. Te rrible. 
 

Q: Now your parents, inVienna. 
Your father continued to run 
the store after theAnschluss? 
 

A: Oh, no.  they took away our store. 

 

Q: I reme mber, you explained that. 

 

A: Oh, no, it was the end. 

 

Q: How long after did that happen? 

 

A: We were still there, maybe two or three months
 after the anschluss, we could keep it and then 
they took it away, until they got organized the N
azis, they found all the Jewish stores. And I 
had an uncle, my father ™s brother, he was very 
wealthy inVi enna.  He had a big warehouse, like 
Macy™s . These people, they went first to thos
e people because they had most money.  He was 
very, very organized.  First, he went to all th
e rich people and they took everything away.  And 
then he went to the people w
ho we re not that ric
h.  But everybody got it in the end. You 
couldn™t keep anything. 
 

Q: When you were planning to leave, you were 
writing to people in phone book addresses, were 
your parents thinking about 
leavingVi enna as well? 
 

A: No, my mot her, shealwa ys said
 he would leave, he would reali
ze it.  She always was optimistic 

and she said, he would leave the 
old people, what can old people 
do for him, he would leave the 
old people alone.  It was very hard for young people to escape so old people it was much harder 
to escape because nobody would sponsor them because
 they are getting sick and old.  So it was  
very hard to get out. 
 

Q: So your mot her didn™t want to leave? 

 

A: She wanted to leave. 

 

Q: She wanted to leave but 

 

A: She wanted to leave but she was optimistic.  
She thought he would leave 
the old people alone. 
But there was no chance she could leave.  Nowh
ere to go. The only country where we could go 

was Shanghai and I™ve got 
a few friends who escaped to Shangha
i.And to Israel was also very 
bad to go.  I had a cousin she went on a boat to 
Israel and the English people, they were just 
fighting with Israel. They sunk her boat and sh
e was killed by the British.  Her mother was on 
the boat and her husband and the baby. And they all got killed. The boat was bombed by the 

British.  It wa s near Israel and it 
was sunk by the British.  Di d you know that? 
 

Q: I didn™t know about this boat. 

 

A: Because I ha d two cousins, her brothers, my c
ousins two brothers.  I me t them before we went 
toAmerica, we went back toVi enna to see if
 I could find out anything from my pa rents. And 
met those two cousins accident ally and they told 
me  what happened to their sist er. They were 
killed on the boat to Israel. 
 
Q: So your mot her 
 

A: When I went back toVienna, I wanted to find out about my  parents.  So, I had a good friend, a 
fa mily friend, and he was blind.  I looked him up 
and he told me  he was together with my 
parents inTheresientadt with his wife and he 
was together and one da
y they took my parents 

away fromTheresienstadt and his wife too but th
e Nazis left him alone because he was blind. 
And this is the way he survived. And 
after the war he went back toVi enna. 
 

Q: Did he tell any stories about  your parents inTheresienstadt? 

 

A: He told me  that they were together, all togeth
er.  One da y, they didn™t  come  back anymore. 
They disappeared. They sent
 them t o the gas chamber.  
 

Q: But he didn™t  describe any stories about how th

Theresienstadt? 
 

A: No, I don™t reme mber.

A: It was terrible.  Everybody was livi

Q: But we don™t know when they were forced to
 move. Your friend, the blind ma n, he didn™t 
reme mber when? 
 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: So, even though they were living in the _____________, they were forced to move. 

 

A: Yes, it was more people together.  Or ma
ybe in the Haborstrasser 
they didn™t want Jews 
anymore. 
 

Q: The landlord was not Jewish? 

 

A: We  didn™t know, it was a big building, a big apartment building.

be to you how and when he left 
your parents, what he said and 
what he said to them, when he said goodbye? 
 

A: They were heartbroken, of cour
se. We  had no contact anymore.  
As soon as I left, we couldn™t 
write a letter or anythi ng anymore because th
e war was on and nothing went smooth anymore. 
 

Q: We re your parents happy when youand your sister went to England? 

 
A: They were heartbroken but they were happy we 
saved our lives. These 
two me n they saved our 
lives.  I wouldn™t be here.  My whole family 
wouldn™t be here.  I would be caught in that 

holocaust. And a lot of people weren™t that lucky.
  Other people who tried to escape to different 
countries, my mother ™s  sister, one of my mother ™s
 sister, she had a friend inYugoslavia. When 
Hitler came, she went to her friend inYugosla
via and a few months later she was caught in 
Yugoslavia with the friends of Hitler. 
 

Q: When the Germans invadedYugoslavia? 

 

A: When the Germans came.  So there was no esca
pe. The only country where really the Jews 
could escape but they couldn™t get in was Engl
and.  Because Hitler never came to England. 
And Switzerland was ________ too. 
 

Q: But it was difficult to ge t into Switzerland. 

 

A: Yes.  Everything was difficult.  Or Italy or
 France but later they got caught in these other 
countries. There was no escape for the Jews. 
 

Q: This man that you know, the blind man.  Did he 
tell you any specific stories about life inVi enna 
before they were deported toTheresienstadt? 
 

A: There was chaos, of course
.  Nobody could ma ke a living anym
ore.  I don™t know what they 
were living on, what they were eating. 
 

Q: Nowork? 
 
A: Oh, no, for Jews, work?   Oh, no. 

 

Q: How about walking on the 
streets or wearing yellow

A: Oh, yes. They put paint on the paveme nts in 
Vi enna, yellow paints, and the Jews had to kneel 
down and scrub it and __________ on top of the 
Jews, the people who were scrubbing the 
floors. They were terrible, the Nazis, such beasts, terrible. 
 

Q: Would you know what they were doing when they
 were inTheresienstadt, those three months  
that they were ther e?  
 

A: I don™t know, just surviving. They gave them 
soup to eat or some thing. And the other people, 
they had to work. Te rrible.

ined healthy until they were deported. 
 

A: Ye s, they were healthy people. 

 

Q: Of course, eventually, you came to know what 
happened to your parents.
  How was that, that 
you found out? 
 

A: We ll, the blind ma n, fir st of all.  But then, 
I wasn™t  sure because he didn™t know where they 

were sent.  He only was inTheresienstadt with 
them. And the reason that Hitler left him alone 
was he would have been a headache for them.  He
 was blind and they ordered to go there and 
go there to the chambers, you know.

were taken away, where did they

ad in the local paper and there was a phone number  
from the Red Cross and they say they could fi
nd some  Holocaust victims  and you could call a  

number. When I called the number from the Re d 
Cross and they sent me a for m bec a use I was 
always wondering what really happened.  It never 
left my mi nd.  I sent out the application and a 
few months later they say they 
have an answer, they found my parents.  I was so surprised.  I 
thought ﬁhow could they find two name s from so
 ma ny million people.ﬂ 
 I guess when they 
really found out when and where they died and what happened.

Grungrund when theAustrian people took it. A

what did she like to do?  We  talked about cooki
ng and singing and I was 
going to ask what else 
she liked to do as 
she was growing up. 
 

A: I reme mber she al ways used to tell us the pe
ople inAustri a, they were anti-Semitic, even the 
kings and the queens, they were
 all against Jews. The only one
 that was good to the Jews wa s  
the last one, Cata Fransion, I don™t 
know if you ever heard of him.  
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: But how ma ny years ago the Jews inVi enna, th
ey always had problems .  Casia MariaTheresa, 
she was very anti-Semitic and _______ MarieAntoin
ette back in Fr ance, her head wa s chopped 
off, you remember this in history? 
 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: And my mo ther al ways said that it was ri
ght for MariaTheresa because she hated Jews so 
much. And in her time  the Jewish people had to go 
to a certain di strict inVi enna and all of the 
Jewish people lived in a certain
 district inVi enna, the Leiber
stein. That™s where I wa s brought 
up too. 
 

Q: Where your parents lived? 

 

A: Ye s. But after Kaiser Josef came inAustria,
 he was very good to the Jews.  He  ma de no 
extinguishing against Jews and non-Jews, they had all the jobs they could have and they all 
loved him.  Kiser Franz Josef of Hapsburg. And sh
e al ways said if he w
ould have still been in 
the governme nt, Hitler would never have come  toAustria. 
 
Q: But he was an old ma n when he was there. 

 

A: Then ___________ was there, that was in my  time al
ready.  He was the last Kaiser of Hapsburg 
and then came  the republic. 
 

Q: And what did your parents think of the republic? 

 

A: They thought it was all right.  
They we re anti-Semitic

ny thought of moving to Hungary? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Your father and mother settled inVienna.  
Wa s it ma inly because of business reasons, because 
of the store he ran or other reasons? 
 

A: I think as you must know that 
in Poland was also always anti-S
emitic.  My father ™s  parents, 
they left  Poland beca use of the anti-Semitic. That™s why they settled down inVienna.  His 

parents settled down inVi enna too. 

 
Q: So your father ™s parents 
continued to live inVi enna. 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: We re they around during the Holocaust? 

 

A: No, they died before. They were very old. 

 

Q: So althoughVi enna was anti-Semitic, it wasn™t  as bad as other places? 

 

A: Oh, no. Wh en Hitler came, it was open up.  It 
was a big difference.  But the Jews had all the 
rights that the other people had. You could go to the police, you could go anywhe re.  But as  

soon as Hitler came, all this disappeared.  But 
to most of the people, 
I think it was welcome.

Hitler in Germany, all the Jewish
 people were shivering. They 
didn™t know what is going to ha
ppen next.  It was terrible. 
 

Q: Did you know any refugees from Germany who came toAus t ria? 

 

A: No.  But I reme mber when Hitler came to Germ
any,  a lot of German Jews, he let them go and 
they even could take their money with them. Th
ey went to Israel, a lot of the m and a lot of 
them went to SouthAmerica. At first he wasn™t  
that bad.  He let them go
 with their money.  But 
a few years later, he got worse and worse.  He 
got crazier and crazier.  He took everything away 
from the m, including their lives.

at the Germans mi ght inva
deAustria and take it

work so he blamed everything on the Jews. 
 

Q: How was the economy inVi enna?

Overnight it happened.  It was after the FirstWo

was worthless.
