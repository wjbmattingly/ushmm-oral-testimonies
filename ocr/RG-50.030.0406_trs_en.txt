GUNNAR SONSTEBY 
 February 9, 2000 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Mr. Sonsteby, it™s nice 
to have you here in Wa shington with us. 
Answer: It™s very nice to meet you. 

Q: Tell me , what was your name  at birth? 

A: My name  at birth was Gunnar S
onsteby, Gunnar Fridtjof Thurma nn Sonsteby 
[indecipherable] 

Q: And you were born what -- what year and what day? 

A: 1918. 

Q: And the month? 

A: January. 

Q: The day? 
A: The day was 11
th
. 
Q: January 11
th
. And where were you born? 
A: In Rjukan, a small place in Telema rk. Andit™s pronounced Rjukan, it™s
 written Rjukan, but I 
was born there in 1918, and I stayed there for abou
t 18 - 19 years, had my 
school there, and I -- 
then I went to the university in Oslo after that  time. 
Q: Tel -- tell me  about your fa mily, your mother
 and your father. What did your father do? 

A: My father was a worker in a hydroelectric pl
ant in Rjukan. My -- my mother, she was a very 

energetic wo ma n, so she started a 
-- a little sewing thing. She was 
a very clever, so she put up a 
little business because my father™s salary wasn't  too big. He was there for -- he ha d been there, 

came from Oslo because most people came into 
Rjukan from different towns in Norway, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
2 
 
Sweden, or England, or Germany. Could come  
fr om many places, so it™s the only pl ace in 
Norway where you have no dialect, 
none at all. People in Norway 
are not aware of this, so now 
I™ll tell them.  
Q: No dialect at all? 

A: Not at all, so I speak in Norwegian, I speak an Oslo dialect. They -- and when I was 

interviewed with my program, [indecipherable]
 said, ﬁOh I™m looking forward to hear your 
dialect.ﬂ ﬁWell, I™m sorry, I ha
ven™t got any dialect,ﬂ I said. 
Q: So is this the only place in Norway where it
™s a sort of -- is it --
 would you call it a kind of 
pure -- 

A: I -- I think so. 

Q: -- nor -- Norwegian. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s interesting. 
A: It came from everywhere, and 
then they had a common language. 
Q: And did you have brothers and sisters? 
A: Yes, I had a sister, little olde
r, tis -- very good, you know, to be 
taken care of, an older sister 
even better than mother some ti me s.  

Q: So were you close with your sister? 

A: Very, very close. 

Q: So what was it like to grow up in 1918, after 1918, in -- in your town? 

A: We were very lucky because Rjukan, the people
 that started up industry there, they were very 
foreseeing. They put up an -- think that some  of 
the workers living quarte
rs is today occur -- 
even today look like salaried pe
ople [indecipherable]. It was 
very good, from the very beginning. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406

So we were very lucky, and we had free schools. 
It was just -- books and 
everything was free. So 
it was extremely well done from that -- 
Q: Now, is that unusual in Norway that the schools were free? 

A: We ll, at that time  it was unusual all over the world. So they were very ahead, I must say. The 

hydro, it™s -- it was shortened to hydro, hydroelectri
c company, but hydro, and I think they had a 
wonderful personnel departme nt, wonderful. 

Q: What did you like in 
school?  Did you like school? 
A: I was lucky in way -- later on, 
you know, I needed to be an average looking fellow, and I was 
also, when I had speeches in schools, they say I wa s also average in schools, and the peop -- the 

people that liked to hear that, aver
age in everything, also in school. 
Q: Did you like school? 

A: I liked history. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And ma th, not too bad.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: [indecipherable] was -- we were 
-- we were always -- when we were not in school, we were in 
the mountains, so it was very important to -- to
 have that role the [indecipherable] physical 
activities. 

Q: We re you a skier? 

A: Yes. We  had to be, when we were in the mountains. 

Q: Right. 

A: At those times, it was always snow
 enough. Today it™s some ti me s scarce. 
Q: We re you close with your parents? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
4 
 
A: Yes, I would think so. I am -- when I left , 
18 years old, to go into military service, and to 
university later on, was a little strang
e, especially for my parents, of
 course, and my sister. But to 
me it was fu ture. 
Q: And your sister rema ined in -- in town. 

A: Yes, they -- she rema ined th
ere, and ma rried to one of th
e people in the hydro again, they 
were all there, and he was la
ter on taking care of personnel. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: My brother-in-law. 

Q: Uh-huh. Were your parents poli
tically con -- active, and -- 
A: Yes. Not -- not active, but they had their opinions, and -- but it was not very radical, because 

they belonged -- as a worker he belonged to th
e Labor party, but wasn™t
 very active. He was 
[indecipherable] and then he was trying to become  
a sculptor. So he was very interested in books 
and all that. So sh -- he should re
ally had gone on the sculptor way. 
Q: Your father? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So, I always felt that. But he was very fond of books. So in 1935, he came with a book to me , 

and I was there sixt -- roughly s -- six -- almost -- 

Q: 17. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And he came with a book written by a Germa n called Wol fgang Langhoff. That wa s, in 

German, Moorsoldaten, it means Moor soldiers. 
It was from a  concentration camp in Germany, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
5 
 
the first one. And that book opened my eyes for N
azism. And my father came to me with it, he 
said, ﬁRead it. You understand a little more.ﬂ 
And then -- from then on, I was an anti-Nazi. 
When I was in s -- the second grade, it were col 
-- a kind of college, then
 we had the discussion 
always in the class, it was 28 peopl
e in our class, was -- four were
 very hard against Nazism, but 
-- and the others were, of course, 
not Naziists at all. But they sa
id Hitler is -- everyone has a job 
there. Roads best in Europe, so -- so wh
at. But if you had been through that book from 
Oranienburg, when they built up right at the st
ation there -- later on it 
was moved a little, the 
concentration camps wer e  moved a little, but at th
at time it was right in 
Oranienburg. I think it™s 
-- was the first in Germa ny, in ™33. They say mayb
e -- they mention another 
place too, but I think 
it was the fi rst, and I think I™m right in th
at. And he got away in -- so he could -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- flee to Switzerland, and he
 wrote the book immediately. It 
was very important that we 
knew more about it, and h-he -- he 
more or less described it so what help -- was later, that we 
saw later. 

Q: Did you discuss the book with your father? 

A: Oh, very much. No, I didn™t need to discuss it 
in that way because he said, you read it, so you 
know a little more about this. So when -- that -- 
we discussed it in school, but most people un -- 
was another thing, the German propaganda came to 
Norway already at that time. In 1936, before 
the Olympics, th-the terrible propaganda, you know?  They had more -- they had sent out young 

boys from Germany into Norwegian schools,
 that were called 
wunder -- in German 
wunderfagrin. And they had been 
educated, they were just 19 
- 20, they we re educated in 
German propaganda. They were going into school
s, and who knew that?  They thought they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
6 
 
very nice to have Germa n, young Germans here. But 
they were all specially trained people, right 
-- put right into schools in Norway. 
Q: So was the government of Norway in some  way 
sympathetic that they a
llowed this, or they -- 
A: No, they didn™t -- no -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- they we re no symp athetic, they just didn
™t -- we didn™t understa
nd it. We  were fooled, 
already that -- at that time, by the Gesta
po me thods, and the propaganda machinery, you know? 
Q: But you in some  sens e understood because you read the book, so did you say things to these 

people when they came into your class?  Did you ask them? 

A: Oh yes, we discussed it, and we -- we were 
-- hard discussions betw
een us. But it was talking 
-- to some people it was just im -- they 
just wouldn™t understand. Wa s very difficult.  

Q: So as it got closer to when the Nazis took 
over, you -- you finished high s -- is it high school 

g y mn a s i u m?  
A: Yes, that™s right.  
Q: And -- and when?  In 1937 - ™38? 

A: Yes, was all -- in ™38, and I 
-- from 1939 - ™40, I was in the u -- at the University of Oslo. 
Q: In Oslo. 

A: So now I studied economi cs. 

Q: And wha  -- 

A: And at the same  time, of course, I had a j
ob. But at that time you would not -- I could -- my 
parent couldn™t pay any education, so I starte
d as an accountant. I was trying to become a 
chartered accountant, which was [indecipherable] a
nd at the same  ti me  I studied economics. So 
when the war came in ninth Ap
ril, ™40, I was writing it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
7 
 
Q: You were writing your thesis? 
A: Yeah, in my education.  

Q: Why was  it economics?  Why were you want to -- want to do economi c s? 

A: We ll, I -- I thought -- I liked it in a way, a
nd I -- I thought the combination of chartered 
accountant and economi c s would do as a good future, give you a good future. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: Interesting future. 

Q: Did -- did you have a sense that
 Germany would attack Norway? 
A: Not at all. 

Q: None?  

A: Oh no, didn™t believe it, it coul
dn™t be done, and so -- so was th
e rest of Europe. France?  They 
didn™t believe that the German
s woul d attack. And the same
 with the British, you know, 
Cha mberlain?  Peace in our time. 
Q: Right. 
A: Lasted a few months. 

Q: So there was no warning. You had no -- when they -- 

A: No, it -- it wasn™t, but of cour
se the -- how they treated German
s in general, the very brutal 
dictatorship, we heard about that
, and we thought it was terrible. 
And of course, we heard about 
the Jews that were -- but nobody could really believe what later came.  

Q: So what was it like when the Germans occupied? What was -- what we re those first few week 

-- 

A: Wa s a shock to all Norway. And then -- but 
you know, Hitler sent an ambassador to Norway, 
called Dr. Bräuer, and he  came with a ultima
tum,  and that said, he came up to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
8 
 
[indecipherable] in the morning, ninth April, 4:30
 in the morning. And then he said, it™s an 
ultimatum. You give in or we start war. And 
the government, I think they withdrew for about 
quarter of an hour, they came  back, we take the 
war. So then it was on. And it had almost start -- 
it had st arted a little before, because Germans sent 
in -- the Hitler™s pride was a very big warship, 
and that ship was stopped, it came almost into 
Oslo, then it wa s stopped by [indecipherable] 
fortress, fortress just before Oslo, near -- near 
the town of Jerbok, and th
at big ship was hit by -- 
they had some  big guns  there, German guns, by th
e way. And that ship was sank. That ship had 
2400 people on board, and they had an orchestra, 
because [indecipherable] going into Oslo, to 

take Oslo in the morning. And it was sank at the 
pl ace there, that fortress. And then the king -- 

the governme nt and part of our congress people 
or parliame nt, they could get out to Oslo, 
because that™s -- ship. They had 800 specially 
trained troops to take over -- to take the 
government, arrest them in the morning. But they
 didn't have the chance, so the government, the 
-- the king of course, and the family, and part or 
most of Parliament me mbers came out to Oslo. I 
could -- they were saved, so they
 could meet outside Oslo to discuss the situation. So they had -- 
they got a little time. If not, they would have 
been taken in Oslo for 4:30, five o™clock in the 
morning, they would all be arrested, and then 
we had, of course, it ha
d been [indecipherable] 
fighting for the government. Now they could get out
, king, and then later on, we fought for about 

two months, Norway, and then the governme nt, th
ey went on fighting in England. And one thing 
what was very important to see, we had -- atthat time , you wouldn't believe it, but we had the 

third biggest me rchant fleet in the world. We  ha
d the biggest tanker fleet in the world. Three 
million people. It  was enormous. And the -- all the ships were  out, on the world. Out in the 

world. And it was only five ships in Norway. And 
then -- then the war came and the governme nt 
came to England. They sent out the telegram to a
ll ships, and they said, 
we are now at war. You 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
9 
 
have to go into allied harbors, New York, London, and they all did. And then we put up a 
shipping company, the biggest shipping compa ny 
the world has ever seen. Wa s thou -- thousand 
ships, and it -- you will never see that shippi
ng company again. It was the world biggest, it was 
incredible. And of course, then
 the governme nt had money. Now th
ey could build up this small 
fleet, the Navy, they could build up a small Air 
Force in Canada. And they could up -- put up 
some  specially trained paratroopers, for all the ti
me , that could go into Norway and start fighting 
there, behind the enemy lines. 

Q: S-So the -- the king and the crown prince, and 
the family and part of the government went to 

London?  

A: Yes. 

Q: And stayed? 

A: They came  over there, and the family, royal fa
mily ca me  over to Ame r ica, luckily. And that 
was Crown Princess Märtha and he
r children, three childr
en, one of them was -- is King Harald 
today in Norway, and they stayed in Washi
ngton there, and they we
re taken good care of by 
President Roosevelt and his wife. They were very close to them, all the time .  

Q: Now, did you know this as you we re in Oslo, 
that you -- you -- you knew 
that the family --  
A: Yes. 

Q: -- excuse me -- the 
royal family had left? 
A: Yes. And we knew that part of the fa mily, the 
-- the children and the wi fe of the crown prince, 
they came out to the last ship from Finland. By 
the way, it -- what was an American ship that 
took them out, over Petcimal in Finland. 
They got out to the States that way. 
Q: I see. So they went 
from Norway to Finland. 
A: To -- right to America -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
10 
 
Q: I see. 
A: And the royal fam -- the king and the crown 
prince, they ca -- came over to England and 
started there. And now the crown prince was later on comma nder in chief for the Norwegian part 

in England. They had to put up a 
mi nistry there, and -- within -- 
within the governme nt, and they 
were leading i -- our tro
ops there, Na vy, and so on. 
Q: So what happened to you?  School st
ops, or doesn™t stop?  What happens? 
A: I was in the insuranc e company, having a job th
ere as a assistant accountant. And then I went 
into the office ma nager and I said, I™m sorry, but I 
have to go into the war, can I have fr ee?  Can 

you give me  a -- so, it™s incredible, isn™t it?  And he
 -- he just said, so, get out, get going, it™s 

time. But I thought I had to tell him, ask him if 
I had the admi ssion. So I went -- then I went over 
and into the woods, north of Oslo, and joined 
a skiing company, with a friend of mi ne . So -- 
Q: And you were going to try to meet the military in the north?  

A: Yeah, so that -- and next day I was fighting 
with the German troops comi ng from -- they had 
been then -- some  of them landed 
in Oslo at the airport, and then they came  north, and we me t 
them there, and we stopped them for  about a good period, a day or two, but we had guns, we had 

rifles only. They had artillery, 
they had tanks, and they had allkinds of weapons which we -- you 
know, it was the strongest army in the world, you know, so -- 

Q: Yeah. Right. 

A: But we kept going two months. You know, Fr
ance fell in 14 days. So I think we did okay, 

expect what we could expect from us . 

Q: Now, ha d you been trained with guns? 

A: Well, I had a very little traini
ng in the King™s Guard. But we had 
-- it™s really interesting this 
is not so well known in Norway. We  had the 
volunteering, military serv
ice among the students. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
11 
 
We put up that before the war. So in the 
-- li -- late ™39, just be
ginning 1940, we had the 
voluntary -- volunteers training ther
e. So that was -- so you ma y have thought some thing could 
happen. So we were right. 
Q: And who started that
, students started that? 
A: That was one of my friends, he wa s a student
 leader, Knut Moyen, he 
started that. And later 
on he became one of the leaders in a sec -- wh
en we started building up small secret gr oups, 
military groups.  

Q: And were there boys and gi
rls in this or only boys? 
A: No, at that time  it was only boys, but of cour
se girls in -- in the resistance move me nt, when 
we should go for instance, into Oslo to look af
ter what had happened [indecipherable] we used 
our girlfriends -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 A: -- because the -- they were not suspected, se
e?  But th-they did fine job. Also, all the -- was 
girls in resistance moveme nt did a wonderful job. 

Q: So after Norway falls, after two months, 
where -- where are you?  Have you -- have you me t 
the -- the military in the nort
h, or you never got there?  
A: We ll, our -- we -- our skiing company fought fo
r about three weeks in southern Norway, then 
we had to give in, and I went back to Oslo. 
And then already some  [i
ndecipherable] I got the 
very bad pneumonia, but I got th
rough it and the same month, more
 or less, July 1940, I me t with 
some fr iends at the student™s hut, out in the w
ilderness, north of Oslo. 
We  started immediately 
think, what are we going to do?  Wh at can we
 do?  It™s now two -- 200,000 Germans here. Where 
can we start?  But we thought we will start sl
owly, building up small groups. Maybe could be an 

invasion, and we hope for that. And -- but one 
thing was what -- very important, it was all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
12 
 
rumors. The  papers were censored, all the newspa
pers. Radios taken, so now it was all rumors. 
Anybody. It was rumors, rumors. So we thought you ha
ve to do some thing with this, you have to 
inform people. So then we starte
d secret newspapers. It was about 
350 newspapers in Oslo at that 
time, and I think it came  up about at least so many 
secret newspapers, not w
ith that circulation of 
course, but one of the newspaper had the circul
ation of 25,000. The newspaper what was that, we 
had -- the Norwegian [indecipherable] had put up 
a -- with BBC, the Norwegian broa dcast to 
Norway, every evening, 7:30. And then these peop
 -- the news was taken down, that was news 
from the free world. It was no propaganda, it was -- we had got all the news from the free world. 

And they were put down, and they were ma gnifi
ed -- I mean, they were copied, and then you 
could have a sheet of paper, you could have
 15, and you spread it round, very often where you 
were working, at your -- it was spread, and th
en the Germans propaganda and anti-propaganda 

was -- for them it was the worst thing. So Gesta
po, it was the most terrib
le thing when -- if you 
are taken with the -- ca
ll it the clandestine newspaper, secr
etive, you would be arrested, and you 
could easily be shot. Or you we
re put into concentration cam
ps. I think about 20,000 did this 
during the war, 5,000 are taken into custody, 
concentration camp, ma
ny, ma ny died. And over 
200 Norwegian jour nalists -- call it journalist, they
 were shot, why?  Because they fought Nazism 

with pencil and paper. And they
 were shot, 200 of them are shot
 during the war, we hear about 
now. So it was just incr edible how the -- and it was 
two things that -- that Gestapo was after, but 
I had a real Gestapo force in Norway, secret poli
ce, security police, they
 were after people doing 
these newspapers, and building up small military 
groups. And of course they were after other 
groups, and later on, of course, the Jews, whic
h we -- which we  couldn™t -- didn™t understand. 
We couldn™t expect it at all, you 
know. They were Norwegians, they
 -- to me  it was Norwegians, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
13 
 
they had Norwegian passport, they lived in No
rway, had -- they were born there. That we 
couldn™t believe at all.  
Q: So let™s talk about these ne
wspapers. Ha -- about how ma ny di
fferent clandestine newspapers 
do you think there mi ght have 
been during this period?   
A: I think it mi ght have been 350. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. All over Norway. About the same  as we
 had before, but of c
ourse not with that 
circulation. It™s just natural. 

Q: And they were distributed what, indi
vidually, you would pass them out to people? 
A: Yes, for instance, when you had copied, 
let™s say 50, you had othe
r comi ng, fetching them, 
and of course we also used schoolchildren to 
distribute them. Could be
 old people, young people 
and schoolchildren, girls and boys. They were spread. But when they were grown up, they were 

taken and of course when you had 20 people [ind
ecipherable] you, it was seen by some  traitors, 
some  infor mers, they would inform on you. They had put up the same  as they had in Germany. 

Security police and informers. You know, in 
any nation you would have one to two percent 
which are traitors to your countr
y. And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the 
-- they were about 4,000 in Oslo. In -- over th
e two, three years, we had 4,000 informe r s. And 
when they saw ma n with the paper, they inform
ed it to the Gestapo, and 
that ma n was tortured. 
And of course, he had been to a place getting it
, and that was -- of cour
se he -- you cannot stand 
the torture, it™s impossibl e with the torture. 
They came to Norway with Middle Age tortur e. 
Middle Age torture, which I had re
ad about, it i -- wa
s history, and now they came into open with 
the Norwegian -- with the security
 police and they -- then they 
also organized, or reorganized 
Norwegian police. So they had about, I should say, 
20 percent of them got ta
ken into a new state, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
14 
 
it was federal police, state police, and they were
 just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they 
were as good as any German Gestapo, any German
 security officer. So it was a very -- if you 
were in that, call it that trad
e, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be 
arrested, tortured and killed. Wa s a very
 great ri sk. We all -- they all knew. 
Q: But it was e-equally as risky to 
take the newspaper and be seen w
ith it, as it was to deliver  it, I 
gather? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. Then they would arrest 
you, they would torture you and say where did you get 
it from?  Wh ere -- where did you get it from?  And, 
of course, they couldn™t stand it, and they -- 
then they were arrested, others 
were arrested. But it all the time 
they kept -- kept on, it was more 
and more newspapers, secret newspapers. 

Q: Did you write some  of the stuff that went in
to the newspapers, or did you distribute them, 
what did you do? 

A: No, we -- I tried a little to begin with, becaus
e I started with this in 1940, we already -- we 
had the newspaper that started already autumn -- 
fall, ™40, and the -- well, I think it fall -- ™41, it 
was really started, on the -- the very good newspapers
. So -- but it was wr itten by our best brains, 
very good articles, and today you can
 read them in our resistance 
museum, they™re all there, you 
can read them, and very interesting to read now. 

Q: So how long did you work with the clandestine newspap -- were you also, by the way, 

working at this -- as an assistan
t accountant still?
 Did you go back?   
A: Oh yes, I tried, but I hadn't had time  for th
is, because now I was a resistant worker on full 
time. 

Q: Full time . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406

A: So then I started to ma ke different aliase
s because after one year, the Gestapo heard about 
Hans Jacobsen, he was one of the -- what the hell 
this is --  one of the leaders. And then the -- a 
ma n was tortured, and he said that we ll, he knew
 Hans Jacobsen, that wa
s his address, and then 
of course then the Germans went out and they co
uldn™t find any Hans Jacobsen at all, he had no 
telephone, he had no address, he had just not
hing. So they -- I was 
there, and then -- 
Q: Wa s that your alias at the time ?  
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Jacobsen? 

A: Then I was Hans Jacobsen. 

Q: Oh. 

A: But then when that was known by the Germans,
 I changed into another name . And I really 
started to fake this myself. I le
arned it, and I think I -- I used -- 
when I had the false papers I had 
no -- I had ma de [indecipherable] myself. So 
I believed them, I knew they were correct. 
Q: Wa s this easy for you to do?  To fake yourself?  

A: We ll, no, it wasn™t easy to start with, but fo
r instance, will you -- you 
will see in one of my 
passports, one of the worst Gestapos we have ev
er had was a fellow called Martinsen, he was the 
head of the Norwegian part of Gestapo, and I 
today -- even today I can write his signature, 
because I had the signa -- his si gnature on one of 
my passports, and I think I today could write K. 
A. Martinsen, pol -- chief of police, secret police 
in Norway. So i -- i -- th
at was -- I hadn™t had it 
in school, so I had to start from the ke -- beginning, you know? 

Q: Tell me  some thing, did you go -- during this 
period, the beginning peri
od a-as you started in 
the resistance in -- did you go back to your fa m
ily and talk to your pare
nts and tell them what 
you were doing, so the -- that they -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
16 
 
A: A that -- 
Q: -- they wouldn™t worry, or they would worry? 

A: That™s an interesting ques
tion, because in ™43, January, on
e ma n was tortured, and he knew 
my real name, Gunnar Sonsteby. I think it was my r
eal name . Then they went right up to Rjukan 
and arrested my father as a hostage for me . Bu
t I talked with him, and I thought this would 

happen, that was the -- the way they did it. And we
 agreed he™d take -- said -- he said to me , 
ﬁYou take your job, I™ll take mi ne.ﬂ He was in
 prison -- concentration 
camp for two and a half 
years. But I knew I had to go on, and he was kept
 in Norway because they couldn™t send him to 
Germany, because then they couldn™t threaten 
to shoot him, you know?  They would have -- liked 
to have in the neighborhood so they could s
hoot him if it was some thing with me. But he 
survived.  

Q: So early on, in 1940, or ™41, you 
spoke to your parents, and -- 
A: Yes.  
Q: -- it was clear to them that this was -- 
A: And my mother knew -- my
 mother knew about it too. 
Q: Okay. 

A: And they -- I helped them, they were -- I wa
s living in Oslo, and when all the [indecipherable] 
were taken. Then, she took a couple of these [ind
ecipherable] up to Rjukan, it was used there as a 
secret [indecipherable] for 
the rest of the war.  
Q: Hm. And your sister, was she 
involved in the resistance? 
A: Yes. Very little, because th-the
n it would have been too much. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So, it wasn™t -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
17 
 
Q: You me a n it was too much to have two children -- 
A: Yeah. In the small town like that, it wouldn™t 
do, it had to be other peop
le that took over.  
Q: Uh-huh. So did you get bored with working 
on the newspaper and wanted to do some thing 
more? 

A: No, I didn™t get bored, because 
it was terribly intere
sting. But I h -- then, in ™41, I wanted to 
go to Sweden to report because I don™t -- I didn
™t know what about our allies?  What about our 
people in -- over the -- overseas, in the -- in Lo
ndon. And knew -- I knew they had their office in 
Stockholm. So I went with one of my  refu -- he
 wa s a refugee, over to Sweden, to report. And 
then they told me , we can use you as a growing --
 as a career between Oslo and Stockholm. So I 
started that. So I had about 15 - 
20 of these trips be tween the town
s, to report. Then I knew a 
little more what they wanted with us, from 
England, wh-what the allied wanted, through the 
Norwegian governme nt and our defense people in -- 
in England. So our -- 
after awhile, I think it 
was in ™42, ninth of April, ™42, then I was in 
touc h with the British. And I said, we™re have an 
organization, I didn™t know what. It was a S.O.E
., special operations executive. And then they 
asked me , are you willing to go back to Norway, put 
up an office in Oslo for us, secret of course. 
And I did. So from ninth of April ™40 to ninth 
of April ™43, I had an o
ffice in Stockholm -- in 
Oslo, and every fortnight it came a courier to me , a
nd I had to report -- ma ke a report, so that had 
be ready when he came, so I wrote the report 
every fortnight that ye
ar, about conditions in 
Norway. 

Q: Let me  a sk you some thing. Prior to that, we
re you not taken to a refugee camp in Sweden? 
A: Yes, but -- 

Q: Or -- of -- of -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
18 
 
A: -- I had the -- I don™t know how I -- it was very
 se -- very special in Sweden, if you left the 
camp, you would be arrested, but I was lucky, so I 
was -- I was wanted in 
Sweden very early. So 
when I was in Sweden later on, I had to be -- k
eep in Stockholm very -- I couldn™t go into hotels, 
so -- and I had some  Swedes want -- could -- they
 dared to keep me  in their small hotel, for 
instance, but when I -- the first 
time I was in Stockholm, I had to
 stay there three mont hs. And 
then I spent my days going into different small 
coffee shops, because in da ytime I couldn™t go to 
that pl ace where I lived, so -- but it was very na
tural that I was wanted in Sweden because you 
couldn™t have Norwegian refugees running all 
around the country, in a war. So it was very 
natural. So I was put in -- prisoner for about th
ree months, but then I got out again, under a false 
name . I put up a new name , a new fa mily na me , and 
I was put to court, and they all believed me . 

So then I got out to St ockholm, and then in secrecy back to Oslo.  

Q: And wha t  was this new na me ?  I 
think it™s rather significant. 
A: Oh, that was the -- I picked the name, then
 I knew the British pe ople in Stockholm, and the 
Norwegians, the army people, they wouldn't -- wouldn™t know exactly what happened to me . So 

I put up a new na me this time, I s -- I call myse
lf Gunnar Lear. And my 
father was a station -- 
gas station owner in Oslo, I -- my mother was Mar
gda Lear, and all that, wa
s a big family, and so 
they all believed me , then Swedish state [indecipher
able] security police, a
nd I got out, but then I 
put the name  Gunnar Lear, that means in E
nglish, you know it™s Gunnar Liar. And when the 
British saw that, they really got 
a kick out of it. So they say, oh, this is Gunnar, certainl y. 
Q: And the Swedes did not check to see 
whether this was a real person, or -- 
A: We ll, they checked, you see, but I -- I did it 
in -- in Karlstar in Sweden. Then I called the 
authorities in Stockholm, and I say, do you know 
any Gunnar Lear?  And then I had given up the 
name , it was a fe llow, was Norwegian that was in 
Associated Press in nor 
-- in Norway. I -- and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
19 
 
-- I had taken him over the border, I had saved him.
 And then he said -- when he said -- I 
me ntioned him, and he was a very well known ma n, of course. So it -- and he said 
[indecipherable] he said to hims elf. He was -- 
I knew he was brilliant. Oh yes, I know Gunnar L-
Lear. Oh, certainly I know hi m. He was very quic
k, and that helped me . Otherwise I would have 
been -- been in custody in Sw
eden for the rest of -- 
Q: Rest of -- 

A: -- for the war. 

Q: So when you became involved with the S.O.E
., is it a person name d Daniel Ring who brought 
you in?  

A: That™s right, he -- he brought 
me  in. And we discussed what my numb er should be, and I -- I 
wanted the number 13. That™s my lucky number. 
And he said well, you can™t have that, another 
fellow -- so you can have 24. From t hen on my 
c over -- call it number wa s 24, under which I was 
known in the resistance move me nt. Numb
er 24 was -- then I knew who it was. 
Q: So now, let me  ask you this question. How -- how do you get money in these situations?  You 

don™t get a salary from the resistance move me nt , how does -- 

A: That™s right, that™s right. You got the m
oney from the British and the Norwegian liaison, 
because they knew I was -- you know, all refugees comi ng to Sweden, they had mone y, 

Norwegian money, with them. And t he -- they were
 -- then they were changed into Swedish 
money, and all this money could be used by us. So
 I had this Norwegian money back to Norway, 
it was sent  back to us. We  used millions of kroner. [i ndecipherable] Again, we had mo ney in 

England, because o -- of our me rchant fleet, a
nd the tanker fleet. You 
know, our tanker fleet, 
they say the tanker fleet -- we -- England had to ha
ve fuel -- fuel. Fuel is a war. And they needed 
for billions of troops, everyt
hing. 60 percent of all Jews co
mi ng to that island, came fr om 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
20 
 
Norwegian [indecipherable]. So they said -- C
hurchill said in parliament, this is about one 
million soldiers. [i ndeci pherable] So that™s the --  the real  effort was Norway -- that  was the real 
effort of Nor way, this fleet. 

Q: When you were staying at
 different people™s ho -- I gath
er you had to move around a good 
deal, you didn™t have one place where you lived. Did you pay people? 

A: No. But no, no, it couldn™t be pai
d, that -- that wouldn™t do. But 
of course, I had all kinds of 
connections, I had enough food, I had connections 
everywhere. So when I went in hiding and 
lived with the fa mily, I had all s 
-- always -- I couldn™t s
it there, eat myself, so
 I had all this food 
for the whole fa mily. I couldn™t go into there with
 food for myself and the fa mily didn™t have it. 
Q: Right. 

A: So it was never difficult [indeci
pherable] that, and that meant so much to them. But they were 
anti-Nazi so they didn™t [indeci
pherable] that. They could offer you meals, which they almost -- 
it™s impossible. So it were -- they
 were all patriots and th-they 
took a very great risk. If they 
came there and I had to shoot myself out, th
e whole family would 
be in trouble.  
Q: So when you became part of the SOE -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- what wa s your -- what was your role?  
The SOE™s connected with the British, yes? 
A: Yes, and later on, of course, with the No
rwegian government in L
ondon, so it was all put 
together and coordinated, so they -- and I was re
porting all kinds -- intelligence was first of all to 
begin with, in all kinds of intelligence, but th
ey needed everything from Norway. For instance, 
pilots, books, to get all kinds of 
things, of the -- all kinds of in
for mation about nor -- Norwegian 
Nazi authorities. Wa s very valuable things for -- for the allied, and of course, all troop 

move me nts. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
21 
 
Q: So you had to have -- did you choose agents 
in the field who would get this information and 
bring it to you?  And were you -- 
A: Yeah, I had friends. I ma de friends, of course, 
and you could si -- when -- when I came  into -- 
outside Oslo and needed a contact for instan
ce, and we -- I knew it was about four or 5,000 
informers. I usually picked doctor. They were ve
ry -- there was very few [indecipherable] so I -- 
I took the chance to run and see the doctor and he
 could help me . Or I would go to the teacher, 
and some times the priest, they we
re all -- that™s an 
-- that™s a chance you took, and I was always -
- I always was lucky, or -- or
 I picked the right people. 
Q: We re you frightened? 

A: I was lucky, I had good parents, so my -- my psyche was -- my psyche -- is that right?  M-

Must have been very good, because I didn™t have 
any. Th -- I must have been very, very -- back 
when God gave us the nerves, I must have
 been way ba -- way back in the queue. 

Q: What do you think in your background, in your
 t -- as you were growing up?  Wa s there 
some thing you think that prepared 
you for this?  It se -- 
it seems as if it was some thing just very 
natural to you, you just decided 
this was what you had to do. 
A: We ll, in a way you are right. I 
just had to do it, it came naturall
y. So and that, of course, when 
you heard how the Nazis had gone, with -- when 
you -- what they did to the German population, 
the -- the Jews, and the same  what they did 
-- did to all your friends. In a way it was not 
necessary to hate them, but you had to fight them
. It was natural to feel so angry. How they 
treated i -- for instance, when they
 arrest ed women, it -- it --  it --  it was incredible that they 
tortured wome n. It was -- how could you believe?  
So we got very angry. And of course -- and 
that was with the -- the rest of my friends. I -- I 
-- they had nerves, of cour
se, but I think this was 
-- that was really what ma de the m fight.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
22 
 
Q: So you were getting infor mation and then you 
were encoding information to send it to -- 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- to England. And how were you doing that?  What was the process? 

A: That was done -- I put my own system. I took a book in Norway, and I started it with a page 

in that book, and I took -- I counted syllables,both ways, and then you co
uld -- it was a hell of a 
trouble, you see, so I got so angr
y and tired, this was like to be 
in school again, I sat nights and 
did that, so I had a -- then I had th
e ma n that could take over. So -- 
Q: So ex -- 

A: So he did that [indecipherable] and it came 
to Stockholm, and I had the same book, the same 
page, and I could easily -- we coded only the name
s. The rest you wrote could be written, but the 
name s were important, and the places, of course. 

Q: So can you explain the system?  
Was it by syllable, or by letter? 
A: By syllabl e. 
Q: By -- by syllable. 
A: Yeah, you counted down in that page, on that
 top of the page, you find a e. Numb er five 
down. So that™s -- I think it was very simple, and 
I think it™s almost impo
ssible to -- if you had 
the book and you didn™t know anything about that, you couldn™t solve it, I think. 

Q: And did they send you me ssa
ges back in the same  way? 

A: Exactly. 

Q: To get -- to ask you to do things? 

A: Yes. But was name s and places that we
re coded. That was the important  thing. 

Q: And not -- not the others, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
23 
 
A: No, because you know, I was in Sweden, and 
reported every -- every quarter. So I -- I knew 
what I thought they knew, what they wanted. 
Q: And how did you go back and forth from Oslo to Stockholm?  

A: Oh, I had good friends, and I knew the way. I had 
the good papers, so I usually took a train o -
- up to border town called Kongsvinger, and from there, then I had that -- who did help me  there? 

I found a ma n that was head of th
e -- then -- the state transportati
on system in that town. So he 
knew everything of course. He helped, he was my ag
ent there. So then I -- 
from stock -- I-I -- in 
that period when I came  on the -- and board a trai
n, I had the control by Gestapo officers almost 

every time . So one of my passports, which you ha
ve seen, that has been
 going through about 40 
Gestapo cont rols, I think. Then I was -- I was a 
stock worker, working in a stock up there. So 
they believed it, and I looked fairly in -- 
innocent, you know, don™t you think so?  So it worked 

all the time . And then how to ge
t into the border?  It was about 
25 miles. Then, in -- in summer I 
used to bicycle and in winter I used some thi
ng I think you know in the States, called a kick 
sledge. Have you ever heard about that? 

Q: No. 

A: You find it in some  places, in Wi sconsin, or so
me  th -- they know it there, kick sledge. They 
know it in Sweden, Norway and Finland. And this ki
ck sledge was -- took me  there, and -- very 
quick -- 

Q: So what is it like?  What is a kick sledge? 

A: It™s a -- a sledge, wh
ich -- it™s a kind of -- 
Q: Do you stand behind them?  

A: Exactly, yeah. And it built in that way 
so you can stand behind it. And then you -- 
Q: But who -- how do y -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
24 
 
A: -- just kicked your way. 
Q: You kick your way? 

A: Yes. 

Q: I see, so there are no dogs? 

A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No, you did it yourself. 

Q: You did -- uh-huh. 

A: Keeping to that built up. 
So it was a very good thing.  
Q: Did you have to change your na -- use differe
nt identities each time  you went, or did you use 
the Liar name -- Lear? 

A: No, no, I had changed ma ny times  since that 
time . And it was so strict. If you came up to 
Kongsvinger, and you™re in -- you we re controlle
d, then if you had a 
passport showing it was 
ma de out in Oslo, you would be taken. So I had to
 ma ke new passports, which they did for me  up 

there -- would -- and I did -- by the wa y, I did them
 s -- myself, but I got a for m up there. And 
then I had the passport being i
ssued by the Kongsvinger police. 
Then they wouldn™t say, oh gosh, 
he™s -- he™s living here. 

Q: Now -- 

A: But if you -- if you had a passport issued
 by Oslo police, you w
ould be interrogated. 
Q: Why?  

A: Because you were suspicious then. You were 
man outside the -- the -- 
the German guard in 
that town, of course they had 
a couple of security police, a
nd they said all strangers to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
25 
 
Kongsvinger, be careful. They mi ght  be [indeciph
erable] they mi ght be resistance workers. So 
that™s was a [indecipherable] 
Q: So when you -- when the police would look 
at your I.D. card, you -- you did -- you weren't 
afraid of anything? 

A: No, I had so good papers. I knew they were good. 

Q: You knew. 

A: I knew I would fool them. 

Q: Look at that smile.  

A: But of course, if you had some  -- some  stupi
d thing could stop it of course, but I was lucky, 
all the time . And I was from February ™43, I was wa
nted and they had nice pictures of me  at the 
Gestapo headquarters in Oslo. Ni
ce pictures, but wi -- an averag
e looking man like me , I have a 
nose, I have eyes, and a mouth, ear
s, that™s -- you cannot pick up a 
ma n - -  I think you can talk to 
the police here, it™s impossible 
to pick up a average looking ma n 
from a picture. I knew it was 
impossible, I -- and I --  I still, I believed it. 
That ma de me  look just 
[indecipherable] I walked 
around in Os lo street without trouble. 

Q: We ™re going to take a break now. 

A: Good. If you -- 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
26 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Mr. Sonsteby, you were connected a little earlier on with the group, 
the resistance group 
Milorg, am I right? 
A: That™s correct . 

Q: Or are you -- 

A: That™s correct [indecipherable] 

Q: So tell me  how -- why it was that
 you did not stay 
with that group. 
A: We ll, I did, because I followe
d it all the time, and I -- I mention the name called Knut Moyen. 
He and I worked very closely together. And ever
ything I could do to help him. Then all the SOE 
sent in instructors from Great 
Britain to Norway, and it was a 
mi xture there, it was a little 
difficult, because the Norwegian organization di
d one thing, and the groups from England did 
another thing. It was the Norwegian independent
 company number one. But then, together with 
Knut Moyen we could discuss this, and I could help him out. We were both a little unlucky 
because one of the people comi ng from England, 
he was arrested, he 
was tortured, and he 
became mor e  or less an infor mer. Of course, th
is -- he was shot, he got shot right through the 
head, and [indecipherable] so it was terrible, but
 we are both a little unlucky there because ma ny, 
ma ny peopl e, 200 people are arrested because of that
 instructor who was tortur ed. But otherwise, 
I took care of -- I was asked by my a uthorities to
 take care of all peop
le come -- all agents 
comi ng in fr om England, from the -- comi ng around 
the central part of Norway, and I took care 
of them, that was part my job, so we could disc
uss this, and in the -- in
 a couple of years it was 
all coor dinated. It was a little because th
e [indecipherable] thought I should built up with 
Norwegians alone, but they finally
 saw that some  of the people 
inside Norway that built up the 
resistance, they were clever enough to let 
us -- so they could cooperate, but you know, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
27 
 
couldn™t talk to each ot her in that way 
in Norway. I-I-It was all secret, you know. 
Communications with England was 
difficult, everything was difficult,
 but in two, three years, it 
was all coordinated within SOE, and the Norweg
ian authorities in Engl
and and also the home  
fr ont people, the military central leadership in 
Oslo, it was all fi nally coordinated fr om I would 
say, ™43, it started. And we had al
so a very good leader who was ve
ry clever, and th -- he was 
over to England a couple of times, which I was als
o, but he really was a good ma n, and he -- they 
understood in England that he was a 
-- quite a terribly clever fe llow. He re -- he impressed them. 
That helped. And we had also, of course, Co
mmunists, which didn™t ag
ree in that kind of 
leadership. But I worked together with them, 
so when I met the man who fought the Germans, 
that was the important part, whatev
er he was. That was the important part for me , so I was lucky. 
Had a good cooperation with them, but
 legally on top, they would 
-- they would listen more, of 
course, to Stockholm, M oscow, than -- instead of 
to us. But they were not under Moscow, but to 
a certain extent theylistened more to Moscow than London, 
which is -- was natural, you know. 
But it --  it worked fa irly well in Norway. 
Q: And how would you distinguish the Milorg
 people from the Linge people, from t he 
Communists?  I mean, how -- ho --  

A: It was the same  young Norwegian people, but 
with a different education, call it. Where -- 
when you came over to England, you were taken car
e of by the British on the -- went through all 
that training schools, and they were
 -- must have been the best 
instructors in the world, because 
when you met -- when you re-met Germans in the wa
r, beginning of the war, the -- like all the 
soldiers and all that, you -- we fe
lt inferior. But after being instru
cted and trained in England, we 
didn™t feel inferior at all. We  
knew we had the best weapons, we 
knew we had the best brains to 
train us, so now we could be equal. And being 
equal, I think we were the best. I think so. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
28 
 
Q: So wer -- were all these different groups, re
presentatives from the m, brought to England?  The 
Milorg had people who were England trained also? 
A: Yes, there were all kinds of people, school
boys, and people without schooling. It could be 
carpenters, lumberjacks, everyt
hing. And they all for med these 
groups, they could go into the 
Navy, they could be pilots. They were trained 
in what™s called Little Norway in Toronto, 
Canada. They were sent over and they did very 
well, and the -- first of
 all, I think everybody 
want to be a pilot. So I reme mber when I wa
s in Stockholm, I should go over to England, I said, 
can I be a pilot?  No, he said, y-you -- you can, but
 I think we have anot
her [indecipherable] for 
you, called the Norwegian independent company, we
™ll put you in there, probably, send you back 
to Norway. 

Q: And why did so ma ny people want to be pilots? 

A: I don™t know, because they had done very
 well, I think in -- 
from -- you know, over London 
in 1941 and ™42, they did very well. So -- 
Q: We re there any bad conflicts 
between these different groups? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: Not at all. It could be, of course, when 
you™re immi grants, it can al
ways be little small 
quarrels, but in nor -- to Norwegians, we had been
 very lucky, and it was -- when we came  back 
to Norway, or when it started, at
 the end of the war, it was onl
y one real body, and that was the 
resistance moveme nt in -- under the leadership of
 the homefront people, a
nd they were the only -
- the Communists were -- didn™t put up a group like 
that, so it was all -- we had -- we had no, 
shall we say possibilities th-that 
they should start fighting each othe
r in Norway. We  were very -- 
extremely lucky. It may be that we are -- I don™t 
know why, really. But we  agreed, or we had all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
29 
 
-- one common emeny -- enemy, that was Nazis. And so
 that was the feeling all over. I think -- I 
would say that 95, we had 98 percent behind us in 
Norway. They tried whatever they could, they 
tried to ma ke the pupils, they tried to ma ke the t
eachers into nat -- Nazis. I mean, it wasn™t -- it 
was -- I think it was impossible in Norway. I think 
we had -- after five years hard propaganda, I 
cannot see that they had any Norwegian turning 
into Nazi. Only opposite, it was the opposite. So 
that doesn™t -- pure princi
ple is nothing for us. We 
have demo cratic rules. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit more about what the 
general population was doi
ng. I understand that the 
bishops made statements all over the count
ry when they resigned, is that right? 
A: Yes. That™s right. And also, our
 -- all of our -- they call it
 the -- what would you call it here, 
the top cour t in [indecipherable] 
Q: Judiciary? 

A: The high court -- 

Q: The high court? 
A: -- people. The -- the Supreme High Court. Th
ey all withdrew alrea
dy in ™41. So they all 
withdrew because it was no -- it
 was no freedom, it was no rights
, it was all German propaganda, 
so they all withdrew. They were not arrested, by 
the way, but they disappeared into -- but didn™t 
do anything. 
Q: And teachers, professors? 

A: Yes, teachers and professors -- 

Q: Wa sn™t there a st rike? 

A: -- they did a wonderful job. To begin with, fr
om ™41 - ™42, then -- the 
little Nazi party, they 
wanted to have schoolchildrens into uniforms . Th
ey didn™t use the swastika, but they had now a 
new kind of a sign, it was a sun, course -- cross, 
sun cross. It was a kind of a cross. And -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
30 
 
schoolchildren should now be put in uniforms. It 
was almost to that. And then they put up all 
teachers, professors were put in a new organiza
tion called some  teacher™s association, Nazis. 
And they all refused. And then they took about
 -- arrested thousand. 500 were sent up to 
concentra -- tra -- concentration camp up in the no
rth, very north, at our no
rthest town, and then 
th -- 500 were sent over to Trawni
a to be shipped up to Trawnia, to this concentration camp up in 
the north. And they had a small passenger ship, a
nd that -- on deck it was German sol diers and 
underneath, in -- in the room of 
the ship, it was put 500 teachers. And they were sent up to the -- 
in that little ship. It would ta
ke about 14 days to the very north, and then -- oh, course it was, 
when an allied plane saw that ship, it was all Germ
ans. It was a small troop transported. It looked 
like that. That was the idea for 
Terboven, the chief Nazi in Norway, and Quisling. They thought 
that was a good idea, maybe allied planes woul
d bomb them, and who had done it?  That kill 
them all. And it was protested very hard from 
the who -- all the populatio
n to Quisling, and to 
Terboven. Please stop it, you 
cannot do this. They did. 
Q: They stopped it? 
A: Yeah, but the -- no, they sent them. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They -- they didn™t listen to protests, they said, 
this is the way we want it, we want them to be 

gone. So we don™t care. And luckily, nothing happene
d, and they came -- but most of i t  -- I think 

it was many teachers that die on the way, it was very 
little wa ter, ve ry little food, and then they 

came up to the concentration camp, and the -- afte
r about a year, the Ge
rmans [indecipherable] 
that little party, you know, Nazi party, they came i
n. So the -- they won this fight, the teachers. 

And it was wome n, and me n of course.

Q: H-How do you account for this response on the pa
rt of Norwegians to refuse?  I -- w-w-were 
the -- is Norway filled with heroes? 

A: No -- 

Q: In some  way? 

A: -- it -- well, you saw all the tr
oubles that -- I think 
that I™ve seen ma ny Germans ha ve seen the 
same , but it was penetrated completely by security
 police, and the informers, that had come  so 

far in Norway, so -- but it was -- they were trying,
 but luckily we -- well -- well, they had -- they 
had a power, so we could just try to in a 
way sabotage it, that was the way, you know, and I 

thought it was just the wa y to do it. To try to help it,
 and they -- we are -- it
™s very hard to get to 
know each [indecipherable] democr acy, I think. Of course, it™s very hard to explain that it was 

only two percent, one and a half 
percent. I-It™s still hard to 
explain that there was so few. 
Q: So few who appr -- who -- 

A: The Nazis. 
Q: Nazis. 
A: Or who were belong -- believing in th
e Nazi . It™s really hard to expl ain.  
Q: In 1942, things got much worse for the Jews
 in Norway. There were what, 1700 or 1800 Jews 
in Norway, am I correct? 

A: About 2,000 in all to begin with. And it was -- 
could have been a few Jews comi ng from other 
countries to come  to that safe Norway. And lik
e Willie Brandt, for instance, and others. I know, 

of course, many Jews came , very fa mous Jews, docto
rs and musicians. But th
en the -- in ™42, it -- 
the first thing that started -- you sa
w my passport, they put a J there. Of course that was awful. 
We didn™t understand it, how they could do it, b
ecause in Norway, one was a Methodist, anot her 
was a Baptist and another was a Je
w, we didn™t think of that. Now 
they tried to ma ke us -- a kind 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
32 
 
of propaganda against Jews, but it didn™t work, it -- not 
at all. It didn™t work
 in -- in Norway. We  
hadn™t had that impression at all. So then it st
arted a little mo re, and the trouble was, now when I 
think back, y-you know that far -- that far -- al
l the -- all the ar-archi
ves, you know, all Jews. 
They found that in [indecipherable]
 and in Oslo. Well, how could 
you help it, in a way, but then 
was when the trouble started, you know?  [indeci
pherable] they wouldn™t know everyone, every 
fa mily, and then s -- I was standing there again at
 the -- summer, July, August, ™42. Then I had a 
fa mily called Rubinstein, and they -- they had 
a feeling that it was ma ybe worse than they 
thought, but the trouble was that if
 you left for Sweden, you lost everything. You were sure to 
lose everythi ng. You lost your house, you lost 
the bank account, if you had any. If -- you lost 
everything, everything when you have
 left Norway. Your business was taken over by authorities, 
Nazi authorities. And if you didn™t, then it was a
bout -- I took the family over, and I think it was 
good idea, but we didn™t feel that
 all sh -- all should be done, b -- because they had Norwegian 
passports. And then the rumors came -- I would sa
y so very much, in October, ™42, but then 
suddenly they went there, and the -- reme mb
er, the police had been organized, reorganized 
some how, it was Nazi police. And then that 
night, it was -- now it was about 700 left, about 

eight, I would say, 1200 had come  out to begi
n with, and later on it was taken over by the 
resistance the people had wanted. 
Every -- in those years, everyone
 that wanted to go out, could 
be helped. I could easily take a family over, I ha
d their o -- a-as I told 
you, I knew the people, I 
could take easily. And I had no tr
ouble going into Sweden. But then 
the 700 in all fami lies, ol der 
people, young people, and -- and children, old peopl
e. And then the -- then one day, one o -- why 
-- I heard it in this way, that one of my friends
 -- I knew a law -- a la -- a young lawyer, and his 
name  was Hawkin [indecipherable]
 and he had a -- I didn™t know 
he was a Jew, or anything, of 
course. I knew he had the passport, he had s
hown me  that. Then he was a young lawyer, then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
33 
 
suddenly, six o™clock in the morning, I was to hear 
this, they came  and they said, you are arrested 
because of the law so and so. He said, ﬁI don™t know that law. I never heard about it.ﬂ He was a 
good lawyer, and he said, ﬁIt™s wrong, it must be
 wrong.ﬂ So -- but then -- well, you have to 
come  with us. Your bank account is now take
n, you lose your house and have you any jewels 
here, we have to have them now
. Eve r ything. And he was so bewildered, of course, and then that 
-- it was a shock to hear that new law, two days 
old, and the shock to hear he had no more things 
in life. They were all taken. And then he was ta
ken away. I heard about this, and of course, then 
it started all -- all over Norway. 
A fe w were -- then, what happened to his wife, and a little 
daughter? Three days later, a ma n 
knocked at the door, five o™clock 
in the morning, and they said 
get away, soon. And so she moved from the seco
nd floor, up to the third fl oor, to -- and the 
fa mily said please come  in here. Si x o™clock th
at morning the Gestapo came  for her and her -- 
but she were -- they were saved. So many had -- 

Q: She was saved? 
A: She was saved, and with the la
 -- little girl. She was takencare of and sent home to Sweden, 
so she was saved. But another thing, you know, wh
at was terrible, I had also knew about the 
young ma n in [indecipherable]. He was a -- a Jew, 18 years old. He told me afterwards that he 
was now in resistance. And then he got to know his 
parents had been told, if
 he doesn™t report to 
the police, they would all be take
n. And of course, he gave hims el
f up, and they took all of them. 
The Gestapo, security police, Nazis, lies, lies, 
and lies, that was all they had comi ng fr om that 
German [indecipherable] 

Q: So, did the resistance warn 
Jews and say, things ma y happe
n, we want to take you out of 
Sweden, or did the Jews ma ke contact 
with the resistance to ask for help? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
34 
 
A: No, I just -- for instance, we had a fa mily, 
which I talked about, we discussed that openly. 
When I -- we had a -- a career, he -- they kne
w him very well, so they heard from Stockholm, 
they had news from the outside world. So they 
-- they heard about th
e Crystal Night, you know, 
all that, so now they started to think, ma ybe 
it can happen here. And about the 1200, they have 
started to think that way. But I talked to Jule Ben
ko my friend that is here with me . He is one of -
- in our parliame nt he wa s the speaker of our 
[indecipherable] parliame nt for 12 years, and we 
discussed this. He was a young Jew at that time. 
He was in resistance, ™42, so we discussed 

between ourselves now, we are di
scussed it now, what did you thi
nk -- what did I think. We  had 
the same  view on this. We had just thought the sa
me  in Augus t. So he -- then Gestapo was -- had 
wanted him,  so he went over to Sweden, of cour
se, because  we had to flee, because he was now 
wanted by the Gestapo, then you had to flee. And he -- 

Q: So what -- what was your view, 
that it was so alike at the time? 
A: That was that we didn™t -- we couldn™t beli
eve that they would be 
arrested, or -- or w-we 
could believe that they would be
 arrested to a camp in Norwa
y, but the rest we didn™t at all 
consider. And he went over to Sweden and la
ter on he came over to Canada and joined the 
Norwegian Air Force, and all his family are 
lost. All of them. So he knows what happened. 
Q: So in 1942, you don™t know what™s happening in 
Russia, you don™t know that there are more 
than a million people who have been shot. 

A: We ll, in --  they --  how they trea ted -- when
 they came into Russia, of course. But comi ng -- 
going on into Norway, trying to keep them -- they tr
ied to keep us as a civilized nation, but all 
the -- the rule there, it wa s harder
 and harder. Hitler had of course
 hoped that th-the Nordic types 
there would be drawn in, because -- so he was 
furious when they had this fight -- all the 
resistance in Norway. And we lo
st ma ny. Also at this time  of 
™42 August, it was thousands of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
35 
 
Norwegians that were waiting to get out Sweden, 
because Sweden were ne utral. It was important 
to us that Sweden was neutral. Without the ne
utral Sweden I cannot see how we could have had 
a resistance at all. Because al
l routes towards Engl and, over the sea, were stopped in ™42 for 
refugees. And it -- we could take
 50,000 over to Sweden during the 
war. And we had them out at 
the same  times, at -- this shocked us, the Je
ws, we had -- could have had two, 3,000 in Oslo 
waiting to get over to Sweden to save their li
ves. We  als -- mi xed together, you know, so -- 
Q: W- We re the Swedes like the Norwegians in 
the sense of even though they were politically 
neutral, were they anti-
Nazi in your experience? 
A: In my opinion, I met only at the border in
 sma ll town, Gottenberg, also, and even in 
Stockholm, I didn™t meet anybody that had a Nazi
 sympathy. I knew it was some , but I -- I didn™t 
meet any. And I had a wonderful -- but I -- it wa
s difficult when I -- I had my headquarters at the 
-- at the farm, on the -- right 
on the Swedish Norwegian border.
 And then I understood that on 
the other side, the custom officer, 
I was pretty sure he was intellig
ence officer. Befo
re I had been 
in army, lived in Sweden, I [indecipherable] custom
 official, with a officer -- intelligence officer, 
and I was right. So I got in touch with him, and from then on we worked together. But if it had 

been known, and the police, they came up and fetched me  on the border, and took me  in this 

sleeper to Stockholm. I was -- had a free way. And 
I -- I could tell them about all Norwegian -- 
all troops, Ge rman troops, were they difficult, or 
could they attack. I coul
d tell them everything, 
and -- but if this had been known in Stockholm, in 
the Ministry of Justice, they would have been 
arrest ed, because if you ha -- re -- if you, in front of
 Ger many, in front of Hitler, it™s only wer -- 
one way to be neutral, that is to be 
neutral. That™s -- that™s my view on it. 
Q: You decided at some  point, I believe 
it was in 1942, that a ma n na me d Swenson -- 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
36 
 
Q: -- mi ght be willing to become  part of the se
cret police so that he 
could be a -- I guess one 
would say a double agent in some  way, yes? 
A: You™re well -- very well advi
sed. My -- I came to a small town called Notodden, very near to 
my home town. Had a -- I came to a small town called Notodden. There was a policeman, he was 

a secret member of the military groups. I said to
 him, how are you liked in Notodden?  We ll, very 
good. Will -- will you try to be a little more, yo 
-- not rude, but be difficult to the population. 
And then I said to him, why don™t you try to come  
into the Nazi police in Oslo. And of course, he 
applied, and it was sent  back for the police head
quarters, Nazi, they send back, what kind of 
people to the -- to the -- the pa
rty me mbers in Notodden, that -- the Quisling party me mbers. And 
they said, ﬁHow is Swe nsen?  Is he a -- could he be  a resistance? ﬂ  No, he is not. He is one of us. 

Of course it was very ba -- very sad for Swense
n, too, because the population there, they more or 
less hated him because they thought he -- that he r
eally was that. So then I said, you come  in to 
the police, and he joined the police, st ate police,
 and the -- or the federal Nazi police. And then 
one day we had two people that was arrested, so 
we agreed that Swensen had to be offered, he 
had to -- now he had to take those people out and 
try to get out of Sweden, too -- over to Sweden 

[indecipherable]. He had the right papers, and he
 went up to the -- worked together with the 
Gestapo people, the Germans, and they said okay, you can interrogate them. So he took them out 

from the prison, did not interrogated, put -- 
took them over to Sweden. And he had also 
[indecipherable] so we lost a very good spy of course, within federal state Nazi police. But he 

helped me  that -- that time . I got go know -- got
 his passport, police passport, so I ma de one 
similar. So now I will --  had also
 the passport as a secret  police 
line within fe deral police. And I 
could use that for special times, which I did. 
So it was good to have, to pretend being a -- a 
Gestapo. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
37 
 
Q: So did you have -- just to be
 light a little bit, did you have 
a big wallet filled with all these 
different I.D.s, or did you keep them in your
 apartment and take one when you needed one? 
A: No, the reason -- you know, I came over to Sw
eden every fortnight 
-- every fourth month. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Then I took them ove r to Sweden and let them
 stay. And I had notes --
 note, it was crosses 
and all that, and I left my books in Sweden every 
time I had new, new, left them over, new, all 
the time . 

Q: I see. 

A: So when the war was over, it was all in Swede
n. So that™s why I have them now, I could show 
people. They™re very -- very few know this in 
Norway, I think, but I think they™re very unique, 
the whole collection. 

Q: Why would some body like Swen
sen agree to be a de --  
A: He -- he -- 
Q: -- it™s such a difficult 
position to be in, you know? 
A: No, he was -- I knew he was a good ma n, and I kne
w he was in -- in the -- in a military group, 
he had started it in Notodden.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So he was one of the very good people. So -- 
but he was one of the few that really could do 
this. Otherwise we™re taken as being in resist
ance, you know, and arrested
 and tortured. So he 
had been lucky. 

Q: So for how long was he acting as this secret -- 

A: Oh, it was a very short time, about three months. 

Q: Did he have a family? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
38 
 
A: Yes.  
Q: So -- 

A: But they were not t-taken. 

Q: They weren't? 

A: Yeah, well they stayed in Norway. That was 
difficult and different, very
 different. Some -- i -- 
some  of the fa mily would be taken, but very ofte
n they were -- well, ma
ybe not -- they had not 

enough space in their prisons, so they had to real
ize, are they important, are they dangerous. So 
they let them out after ma ny hous
e wife, or wifes of the resist
ance workers were set free after 
two, three months.  

Q: But that must have been difficult for hi
m being in Sweden won-wondering what would 
happen to his wife. 

A: Could happen anything. 

Q: Anybody, uh-huh. 
A: They could have been shot. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Because that was very serious, what he ha
d done [indecipherable] he was a real spy -- 
Q: Yeah. Right. 

A: -- within their outfit. 

Q: Hm. When you wrote your book, you -- you talked 
about this feeling of
 restlessness that you 
would get in a situation, a kind 
of sixth sense that some thing bad was going to happen. There 
was one evening when you™re with Ba ke
r Anderson, and his daughter, I believe. 
A: Yes. We  ran -- 

Q: And in the mi ddle of the night
, you th -- you thought something -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
39 
 
A: Yeah, we went to the mountains because they had a beautiful place up there, and um -- far up 
in the mountains in Telema rk district, not fa r from Rjukan by the way. And we went up there, 

and it was also a courier from -- from Stockholm, 
which had alls -- all kind
s of false papers, too. 
But we went up in the mountains there, and we sat 
discussing der night, a
nd I had a feeling that -
- it must have been -- I don™t know if a sense,
 sixth sense, but must have been kind of a 
computer, and I put that thought in my brai n, ma ybe -- he is there, ma ybe he is under 

surveillance, what about 
his daughter?  They had been arrested on
ce, so it must have told me , get 
away. So in -- during the night, two o™clock 
at night, I left. I -- they -- they laughed 
[indecipherable] think I was very stupid. So I le
ft. Six o™clock in the morning it was, 30 me n 
with three leaders fr om different
 [indecipherable] comi ng for me. 
Q: 30? 

A: 30 of them. And they were looking for Mr.Bloch. I had [indecipherable] got by the name  Mr. 

Bloch, I thought that was a nice name. So it was th
e Bloch this time. They had heard that Bloch 
was with -- they were arrested, but they were 
let out after two, three m
onths in prison. They 
didn™t -- they said, these people can
not -- they don™t know anything, so
 -- but that was a chance.  
Q: And you biked -- 

A: Yes, I biked -- 

Q: -- to where, to your home? 

A: -- over in the mountains, over to Rj ukan. And was 
in a way a little stupid
 because in Sweden I 
had lost my real identity card for Gunnar Sonste
by. I had torn it to piece
s so the secret police 
shouldn™t -- the Swedish sec -- couldn
™t get it. So I went up to Rjukan to the police there. I knew 
they didn™t know I had been in Sweden or 
anything, I knew that. I took the chance and I got a 
new, real passport, which is in my collecti
on now, for Gunnar Sonsteby. So, I had luck. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
40 
 
Q: And how did you explain th
at -- you just lost it, is
 that what you told them?  
A: Oh yes, I just told them I lost it in Oslo. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They didn™t know. So I was lucky, they didn™t know.  

Q: Now, Anderson was a baker, yes? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And did you not have  some thing to do with hi
s place in gro -- was it Groland Street in -- 
A: Oh yes, I had -- since that, when -- after they
 had been out again, we 
started again. That was -
- I think it was one of my central 
places in Oslo, it was, actu -- 
ma tter of fact, but then he was -- 
later on he was under suspicion again, so then I 
had to take him over to Sweden. But his wife, 
and la -- daughter, they were 
standing, helping us for a year, 
and then finally we had to send 
them also over to Sweden as refugees because
 then the -- there was all blown, the Gestapo 

[indecipherable]. Then we disappeared
 of course, from that place.  
Q: Right. And how did you use that place?  Wa s this
 a -- a meeting pl ace for the [indecipherabl e]  
A: Meeting place for all kinds of 
resistance workers. It had starte
d -- he started in a way, but he 
had the bakery. The Germans ca me  t o Oslo a
nd I said, you are putting 
your bakery at our 
disposal. He said, no, I don™t. And I took it. He di
dn™t want it. I said -- one
 of the very few. And 
then he started to send bread over to the prison. Was 
very near to his place, and he -- they got in 
some  bread to the prisoners ther
e. So he -- that™s how he star
ted, and later on all the couriers 
came to hi m and we me t there. So it wa
s a real  central place for resist ance. 
Q: Did you meet upstairs?  The bakery
™s downstairs and you me t upstairs? 
A: Yes. Was very important because you had to be
 in places where you were not seen or mi xed 

in to other people. The shop was downstairs, it 
was hundreds of people in and out all the time . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
41 
 
And you can go in there, and you can just go up the 
stairs to the second floor. And when I came 
into the shop it was a very nice girl standing th
ere behind a desk, and I had also eyesight with 
her. I knew if she had the usual way, she smile
d and say hello, how are you Bloch, or -- she 
knew my different name s. And then if she would 
say -- or just smile. If she had been some thing 
wrong, I would have known it imme diately. I would 
have turned around. So that was my security 
sign. It was very simple and effective. 
Q: So a -- a lot of your work really depended 
upon people who were not necessarily working in 
the resistance, but always supporting you. 

A: Oh yes. And you got supporters everywhere bac -- but you knew, a mo
ng your supporters in 
Oslo, it could be f -- one of the 4,000 informers. So you had to -- a little luck. 

Q: Did you have a gun on you all the time? 

A: It depended. When I had a sabotage to do, 
an operation in Oslo, I 
was arme d. But when I 
worked -- wa lked around and organized and did a
ll my resistance work, my intelligence work, 
helping -- taking people over to Sweden, then I w
ould never carry a pistol of course, because it 
was controlled everywhere. I would run 
into control, I would be there. 
Q: Did you also have poison with you in case you were caught? 

A: No. No, I didn™t want that. 

Q: You didn™t want it? 

A: I want -- I lived, and during th
e night I was sleeping behind a locked door, on the fourth floor, 
third floor, and I knew I would -- they would wa
ke me  up and I could st
art fighting them. Now I 
always [indecipherable] hand grenad
es, a couple of pistols, and th
e last six months I had also 
some explosives besi de my bed. Because I coul dn™t be taken. I knew -- they -- they knew, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
42 
 
knew. It wasn™t if they interrogated me, they co
uld torture -- they didn't need -- they knew I 
knew. So -- 
Q: So you were simply going to fight. You we
re either going to get out or be killed? 
A: Yeah, I had to because  I would ruin the whole organization, if I was -- was taken. 

Q: Because you knew too much? 

A: It was just natural thinking.  

Q: At one point in 1942 -- I don™t 
-- it was the late summer in 
August, I think you got some  sort 
of a order to borrow the printing pl
ates from the bank, from Norway? 
A: Yes, that was a interesting j
ob. I got the letter from the Minist
er of Finance in England that 
was -- they wanted to print money in England be
cause they were scarce of
 money in Norway. So 
they asked me  to go to the Bank of Norway, it™s lik
e -- like Fort Knox here, 
is it? And the -- fetch 
the steel plates for 50 kroner and 100 kroner, th
at™s about five dollars
 and 20 dollars, roughly. 
That was very important to have, and I got to kno
w some  of t he people, and of course their bank 
ma nager, he -- when he saw me , a young boy of 23, in
 with the -- was a very bad -- my clothes 
were a little filthy, and they said, this fellow mus t
 be crazy if I should believe him. And he said, I 
want -- first of all, I want a few words. The ma
n t hat -- running the radi
o from Great Britain, the 
Norwegian radio with BBC, he was very well know
n in Norway, and he was a personal friend of 
the bank ma nager, and he said, I want five lines 
from hi m, five words with that and that. And 
then he said, now I got rid of that fellow. Thr
ee weeks later I came  up to his office and I showed 
him, here it is, from your friend in England. And th
ey saw it wa s, then he believed me , then that 
started the w
hole thing. 
Q: And this was real, you 
didn™t forge this letter? 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
43 
 
Q: No, this was a real one. 
A: No, it -- he knew it was the real
 letter. He knew that he wr ot
e exactly what he had suggested. 
And he o -- or I -- he also could have had -- we ta
lk -- we -- we talked about that. He could have 
a special from that fellow if I had asked him, 
you say on the radio from London that for instance 
some body si  -- a special sign that the weather is ni
ce today, could be, but he could have got that. 
But we didn™t need it to do that, 
be -- but I could have d-done th
at easily. But then he -- the 
whole board, went into hiding. They
 had [indecipherable] court, they
 didn™t stay at home  that 
night when I had the pla -- pl
ates and took them over to Sweden. The next morning, eight 
o™clock, I could call him and say they™re
 all safe in Sweden and England. 
Q: How did you carry them?  In wh
at -- what did you put them in? 
A: I had, at that time  we had no gasoline. I ha
d a little, but the Germ
ans di dn™t, and they -- 
usually you can use gasoline, and we had a ch
arcoal burner. And you had sacks with also 
charcoal to burn and ma ke the -- the -- the car 
running. And on the bottom of
 that sack, I had the 
-- that little package of steel
 plates. And we took them up to
 Kongsvinger, and -- but you know, 
it™s always happening, some thing, it -- it was dark
 night, and the -- then 
the -- suddenly all the 
lights in the car disappeared, so we
 landed in a ditch. And I said to my friend the chauffeur, what 

the hell are we doing now?  And then a car came
 in, a German car, a big car with about 20 
Germans in. And they offered me  to take us 
up again. And I said -- I 
said, oh, I said, please, 
come  on, I s a id. And when I left them I was glad 
that they le -- left us, I said -- I say, Auf 
Wi edersehen, so nice, you know, 
Auf Wi edersehen. So then -- 

Q: So was this -- you we re in 
a car, or you were in a truck? 

A: No, I was in a car. It was -- I used a -- a taxi 
driver. He worked for me in Oslo. They were all 
perfect, I must say. I didn™t find any taxi driv
er that was a Nazi, by the way, but my friend 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
44 
 
Hornbeck, he -- he -- he -- that was be -- before
 I had got my own driv
er™s license. But I found 
after that , that I had to get my 
own driver™s license. So I ma de one, and drove into the traffic, it 
went all right, in ™42 - ™43. 
Q: Why did you decide that you had to have 
your own driver™s license and drive yourself? 
A: Because I was all tra 
-- al-always a li
ttle -- you had to wait for the driver, you had to find one, 
and if you had your own car with false license pl
ates, it™s -- you wi -- ma y need it very soon, you 
know, very quick. You can™t wait for 
a driver, or a taxi driver.  
Q: So these Germans who helped you were not
 at  all suspicious, were these soldiers? 
A: No, they were soldiers, a
nd they were usually kind -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- of course, to the population, 
because after all,
 they were taught to be, try to be kind to them. 
But when they were ordered to shoot 20 Norweg
ians, they would do it imme
diately. That was the 
difference. They were disciplined, and they 
-- all the leaders, SA 
-- SS troops, you know what 
they did. They got their orders from Gestapo, they worked closely with Ge stapo, all of them, all 

the leaders there. And then you 
were just arrested, shot.  
Q: So you got to Stockholm, you not ified Oslo th
at the plates were th
ere safely, then what 
happens?   

A: They were -- during the night, they were -- th
ey were copied and they were sent back to 
Norway. 

Q: Sa me  wa y, you went back? 

A: Yeah, and I -- 

Q: In the car? 

A: -- put it -- put in the pl ace, back again. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
45 
 
Q: And did you go to the bank at night to
 return these, or during the day? 
A: I -- I didn™t do that
, because at that time I didn™t have -- I must not be seen in the 
neighborhood or any of those, it was too dangerous, 
where I had that -- it wa
s one of the -- one of 
the business there or  firms that s
upplied paper and other things to
 the -- he knew them very well, 
so I had that supplier go to them. Teda Munsen, 
he was -- he knew -- he was one -- one of the -- 
he was one of the very few that [indecipherable] this. He helped -- 
Q: So did he go from Stockholm to Oslo -- 

A: No. 

Q: What -- 

A: He -- he didn™t -- no, he 
was in Oslo, only in Oslo. 
Q: Okay, so you -- 

A: So he helped me  there. 

Q: I see. And then you -- 
A: We  had other people. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. That could be couriers and -- 

Q: Now, we re you in a pa rticularly da ngerous si
tuation at that mo me nt, because you had gone to 
the bank originally a
nd gotten the plates? 
A: No, there -- they hadn™t seen me . 

Q: They hadn™t seen you then? 

A: No, no, so -- and I was at that time Mr. N
ilssen. [indecipherable] Oh, he had a beautiful 
address, he was not there. But what about Nils
sen, have you -- they™ve never heard of any. So I 
was -- I was not there. No trouble. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
46 
 
Q: So what is this, you
r fifth or sixth or 10
th
 name ?  You keep -- 
A: Oh yes, it could now be number 20. 
Q: It could now be numb er 20. So th
e copies of the printing plates -- 

A: That came to England, and -- 

Q: And then they -- 

A: -- at the same time, I had to go up to the pape
r mill in Bergen to get the right paper. That I 
did, was sent over to England. 

Q: And how was it sent to England? 

A: That [indecipherable] paper. 

Q: Really? 

A: Special paper for Norwegian money. 

Q: And was it flown to England or on a ship? 

A: Yes, taken over by courier planes from Stoc
kholm to -- to Scotland. You know, that was very 
strange that you had courier plan
es from Stockholm to England, and you had courier planes from 
Stockholm to Germany. And in a way, they let it 
happen because they both needed this courier 
planes. 

Q: So the Germans didn™t si -- di -- di
d they check what was on the planes? 
A: Oh no, they couldn™t check it in Sweden. 

Q: They couldn™t, because  it™s a cour ier plane. 

A: Exactly. I mean, in Sweden, in neutral Sweden
 they couldn™t check it. But [indecipherable] 
not at all that  -- that we
 couldn™t check the Germans and the allied coul dn™t check. 
Q: So you got the paper on this plane, and the plates. 

A: Oh yes. I didn™t -- that was not my bus
iness, that was done by SOE in Stockholm.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
47 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: British, or  Norwegians. 

Q: But you found the paper? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And wha t  -- 

A: They got the paper over. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I can™t  recall how mu ch it was, but it was -- 

Q: It had to be a lot, no? Because -- 

A: Yeah, but first of all, they could ma ke si mila
r in England with the paper, they had to have 

samples for all the paper [indecipherabl
e] was very good paper in Norway.  
Q: So now they forged million -- I mean much money. 

A: Yes, but they -- I think they ma de about 20 
million kr oner over in England. It was very little 
used, because as I told you, it was -- all the refu
gees came with money, s o of course that was the 
most safe money to use, that 
was the real money from Norway, but
 they we re so well done, of 
course, because the people, it was a very fam
ous company in England, and they had been doing 
that for Norwegians before. So they
 -- they knew exact
ly how to do it. 
Q: So they stockpiled this money in England 
waiting to see whether 
they would need it? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And you didn™t use very much. 

A: The 20 millions 

Q: Yes, wow. 

A: I didn™t use any, but I know some  did in Norway. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
48 
 
Q: It™s quite a story. 
A: Oh, it™s a interesting story. 

Q: Yes. Wh y did you take the name  of Nordstrom, Gunnar Nordstrom?  Do you remember? 

A: You know, I thought that was a nice name  -- 

Q: Nice name? 

A: -- and it was a name  that was used up in th
e district. Could be [indecipherable] i-it™s a good 
Norwegian name . [indecipherable] 

Q: Mm-hm. And did you ha -- you had a cover stor y for each of these name s, yes? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You had to know -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- who the parents were, and what -- 

A: And you see, I didn™t dare to be  lumberjack, because when I saw my ha nds, I say, oh this 
fellow cannot be a lumberjack. I didn™t dare to do
 that, but I said I work
ing in the stock -- some  
stock up there, some  wa rehouse -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- by the way, was a warehouse worker. That 
suited more to my hands and the rest. 
Q: So let™s talk a little bit a
bout this so-called ordinary look th
at you have, that you can sort of 
pass, that you™re not suspicious. 

A: Well, as I said, my -- I had no special marks, 
I had ears, as I said, a
nd a us-usual nose, eyes 
and it was no special -- if you should try to desc
ribe me  it™s very difficult. When you go out now, 
I™m sure you -- if you should describe me  in front 
of the police, you wouldn™t be able, I™m sure -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
49 
 
pretty sure, I™m so average. Average looking, su
ch an average ma n, so you have to -- not to 
behave, but you had to feel one. 
Q: But your demeanor is very quiet. Is that -- 

A: Is it? 

Q: Well, that ™s what it appears to me. 

A: I don™t know -- 

Q: Is that unusu -- was that unusual in the resist
ance?  We re people -- I mean, I suppose one often 
thinks about people who were in the 
resistance as very strong, and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- sort of -- and you™re -- 

A: We ll, to begin with I thought th
at I had the big heavy people, lu
mberjacks, but after awhile of 
course -- they mi ght be very br
ainy, too, of course, too, but they 
-- they understood that the most 
important thing was what did you have in your 
head. That wa s a -- of course was the most 
important thing. 

Q: Did it surprise you how easily you -- you™re very innovative -- we -- yo -- do you know what I 

mean, you -- 

A: It™s just -- it™s interest
ing that you ask that question becau
se after the war, I thought everybody 
had -- had the -- my experience. I thought that was 
usual. I didn™t know that I had a very -- had -- 
had a very special job, or -- 
I thought everybody had the --  
Q: That everybody was doing this? 

A: Yeah, I thought so. So I was a little depressed 
when I found out that some  things I had been -- 
wasn™t all done. It was much -- I 
think that was ma ybe a good thing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
50 
 
Q: We ll, clearly it was a very good thing. But wh
at did you think then when you realized that 
what you were doing was unusual?  Did you -- 
A: Yeah, I felt it was -- ordinar
ily I knew that it was ma ny saboteu
rs. I knew they had been lucky 
and done lots of things. So I knew I was one of them. So, easy. 

Q: When you were in Stockholm in autumn of 
1942, you were then made a liaison for all the 
new agents? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: In Oslo, is that ri
ght, and what did -- 
A: In Oslo, er -- 

Q: And wha t  does that mean?  

A: You know, the most important part of our 
Norwegian independent co
mpany number one, was 
not to be saboteurs in Norway, also but first of a
ll instructor s in a secret army. So most  of them 
came, for instance, when I came by boat, into this
 west coast, I didn't -- wa s not in touch with 
them, but when they came , very oft e n they cam
e through Oslo because it was -- you had all the 
refugee routes, so you could come  easily to -- over
 to Sweden at that way. When I had finished 
[indecipherable] I had to get -- go out to Swede
n, and flown back to England. So then I had -- 
they knew I was in Oslo, so to me  Oslo became such a small town. It is, but -- so I knew, and 

ma ny peopl e knew where I was -- I could tell [indeci
pherable] some  people knew. And then they 
got hold on me , I could help them going out to Swed
en, I could help them w
ith a bicycle, I could 
help them with food, I could help renew his pa
ssport, anything. And I had country -- I had a 
couple of men with me . So we had the -- we 
had the -- all kinds of connections. A doctor, 
anything. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
51 
 
Q: If you would count up the numbe r of conn
ections you had in Oslo, how ma ny people, do you 
think?  
A: I-I think I met -- every day I met new people, up to 10 - 15, every day. 

Q: Really? 

A: It was incredible. When I came to Engla
nd, I was interrogated by this [indecipherable] 
security police in London, outsi
de the London. And I s -- some pe
ople, they voiced their opinion. 
Everybody is arrested, but not 24. He is a spy. And 
I was very glad, I -- I knew, I had a feeling 
that they -- they had to control that. So the 
policeman was put -- wi -- 
interrogating me  and he 
said, write down all the name s, you know, all le
aders. I put 200 names on
 the paper. And he 
started. Why did you deal with that man?  Because 
they had hundreds report
s from many of these 
leaders already in England, so he could contro
l. What did you -- why did you meet Petershim?  
What about the lawyer Hansen
?  What about Dr. So and So. 
And I could explain everything, 
naturally, how they were arrested and not me . So
 t hey finally said, okay, we let him go back to 
Norway. He -- we are hundred percent that he 
is good. But to me , when you are a sus -- when 
you are suspect and all that, it™s ve
ry good that they -- I was so glad
 that they looked into this  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: We ™re going to take a break now. 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
52 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Mr. Sonsteby, in October of 1942, a couple of agents were executed by the Gestapo, was that 
-- is that r -- let me  ask it another way. Th -- 
w-was it very often that 
agents would get caught 
and tortured and executed? 

A: Yes. If you take our -- this compa ny wh
ich I me ntioned to you, the freedom company in 
England, it was about 200 when the -- in the mi ddl e of the war, and -- and about 55 were taken 

and shot. Was quite a high percentage. Tw
e -- nearly 20 percent, ma ybe 250 boys. And 
some ti me s you didn™t hear any, but suddenly they 
were caught, it was an informer very often, 
and then they were taken to custody. First of all, 
to begin with they were 
tortured and they were 
sitting there in the prison. But 
later on it came an order, a Hitler order that they should be 
tortured and shot within 24 hours 
[indecipherable] the last -- fr om 
™43. De r Fuehrer bifel, it was 
called. The Hitler™s bi fel, or the Hitler™s or de
r. But it could ha ppen. And of course, not only 
people from -- agents from Engla
nd, but in the resistant 
groups, in Milorg for instance, if a ma n 
was taken there, he was very badly beaten a
nd -- and that could happe
n once a week. Could be 
one that was taken and the whole -- and some
times you could get -- arrest many who were 
tortured, and then they could give up, up to in one,
 two nights, and also it 
could have been almost 
200 arrest ed. Some will be -- but most of them we
re taken into custody, and -- or -- or sent for 

new interrogations, and later on to Germany, to 
concentration camps to die. To work for two, 

three years and then off.  

Q: Do you -- were there any particular incidenc
es that come re -- th
at re -- you reme mber?  
Friends of yours who were working with you who were caught? 

A: Yes, it was one very bad, I think, actually on t 
-- here was arrested in an apartment in Oslo, 
and he was sent down to [indeciphe
rable] shoes, where we had our 
machine. At that time it was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
53 
 
very, very tough prison, and it was Ge rman guard
s everywhere [indecipherable] escape, to 
escape was sum -- almost impossible. But we trie
d to get them out, but we thought we couldn™t 
ma ke it. So I had cook -- the cook there, they 
had a good cook, the Germans. And I asked him, if 
my fr iend wants a poison pill, how ca n he do it? 

Q: ﬁ Well,ﬂ he said, ﬁhe can stand by the window
 and be pretending that he™s cleaning the 
window and he loses the little clot h pi ece, and then
 I can take it out, I™ll put the pill in there.ﬂ 
They did. So it worked, but some  Ge rmans had seen
 it, but the -- they couldn™t prove it, so the 
cook was a very good cook, so they said, well, forget
 about it. But my friend got a pill. When he 
understood that we had given up all 
hope, he then thought to hims elf,
 now I try to flee from here. 
And he really almost ma de it. He came  to the wa
ll, and the -- jumped over the wall, he had come  
all the way out. Then a German sol dier -- by 
the way it wa -- he was an under -- he was a 
[indecipherable] or some thing, and 
he took his rifl e and shot him. So, it wa s very sad, but he had 
ma de it, but it was a very -- an ordinary thing, a 
-- a soldier wouldn™t do th
at, but this time he did 
it. So it was very un -- unhappy thing. He was -- we
 were very close. That could be, of course, 
several -- actually we had also when I was in 
England, two of my best me n, they wanted to do 
some  anti-propaganda. It was a school in London 
what they called the anti-propaganda school, 
it™s another English name  for it, but they did 
some of that in Norway, trying to ma ke the 

Germans believe that it was a secret opposition betw
een German soldiers. I tried to pretend that. 
It was -- and then they got hold of, from one of 
the districts, the Milorg had taken to -- had hid 
two German soldiers, but thei r --  they pretended to
 be -- didn™t want to do any more, they were 
getting out of the army, trying to get over to 
Sweden, they pretended. And my friends, they 
believed in it. And when I me t these two guys, in
 Oslo, the Gestapo was there, and they were 
Gestapo people, so they were both sh
ot, shot in the -- in a restaur -- 
in a café. So there™s one le -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
54 
 
one died imme diately, and the other one, Taloxe
n, he survived, but very -- hardly wounded, but 
then he was taken to hospital firs
t and then to prison, and then he -- he hanged hims elf. He -- he 
knew he couldn™t take it, he knew 
he would give in, give up some  na me s, s o he didn™t want to 
take the chance. I was in England when I heard 
this through the -- we ha
d the wireless operators, 
they wired it over to me , so I 
heard it. So then I had to pick
 up new people, two new people to 
take them ba ck to Norway. That happened. 
Q: Mm-hm. Tell me, did -- did the agents, ot
her than you, who had hundreds of na me s in your 
head, did most of the agents only have a few name s -- 

A: Yes, usually. 

Q: -- because they would give -- oh. 

A: They were not in my position, they were ju
st comi ng in from Engl
and, doing their jobs, and 
back again. 

Q: I see. 
A: So that was a big difference. But they ha
d names, of course. They could say, how did you 
come  to Nor way? 
Q: Right. 

A: Well, we came by ship. 

Q: Ship, okay, that was [indecipherable] but 
who helped you when you came ashore?  What was 
his name ?  Was it [indecipherable] w
ho could it be?  That wa s very dangerous, of course. So they 
knew enough name s to ma ke trouble.  

Q: Did a lot of agents use aliases and keep
 changing their names, so -- so that -- 
A: No, they ha -- they were given a 
name  in England, before they left. 
Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
55 
 
A: So that was another thing, I -- I had to send 
over to Stockholm, I had to send different forms 
for different passports, that was 
also a thing. And they were very
 well done in -- in England, but 
if you had taken a name , and that ma n had been a 
policeman in that district, then he would be 
shifted out. If you ca me  after two 
years, then suddenly -- and t
hose name s hadn™t been checked, 
one of the groups came right into [indecipherable]
. He was [indecipherable] by a Nazi. It was a 
new ma n, and it was a -- a small shopk
eeper that they also could use.
 He was a Nazi at that time. 
So all na -- everything, all information had to be ve
ry up to date. So that was always -- when they 
ma de out the for ms, passports in England, it woul
d -- could be a little mo
re chance. I didn™t have 
that chance in Norway. So our pape
rs, they were more dependable. 
Q: Let me  a sk you another question about sort 
of your everyday life. Whe r e were you eating? 
Where did you eat lunch, where did you eat dinner? 

A: Tha-That™s a ver-very interesting question. When 
I stay at a place, I didn™
t want to be seen in 
daytime, so I usually went out in the morning, 
well, say nine o™clock, then I didn™t come back 
until 10 - 11. 

Q: At night. 

A: Yeah. Because I di dn™t want to go in and out
 fr om that building. So then I had my luncheon 
for instance, down at the bakery. I had my dinne
r with a -- an old lady, a widow, whe r e I could 
come . I -- but then when night came I always we nt
 back to my hiding place, and I knew it had to 
be shifted in, for instance, three months. Then 
the people could have seen
 me, and it was some -- 
after the war, some  of the me mbers of the N
azi party, they said, we
 didn™t do anything wrong. 
No, but when they saw a ma n going in, out -- for 
instance with a rucksack every night, they 
reported it, and they had to report it. If you were a 
me mber of the party you had to report it, and 
that could be disastrous for us. We ll, they di
dn™t understand it, and you 
can explain it to them, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406

but that™s the way of a tr
aitor. Some t i me s they are forced when they are in the organization. That 
was the same in Germany. When you were in the pa
rty, you were forced to be -- more or less to 
be a -- an informer. We had the same in Norway. 
Q: And wha t  were you doing from ea rly morning until 10 o™ clock at night?  We re you actually 

going some place to work? 

A: Oh -- me eting people.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: All day. And we -- a couple of time s my s
econd in command, we had a apartme nt which we 
used in the day, in the daytime, [indecipherable]
 so we could sit down, have coffee and sit and 
talk and do our passports. We  had a small -- we 
had a small office, which we had hired, so we 
have spent some  time there. And then when we 
had -- were -- had a sabotage job done, we also -- 
they used, very often -- the night, of course
. Sometimes it was daylight when we did our 
operations, but some  -- usually nights. And then th
e -- the place where I lived in for about a year, 
then the -- the lady there, she understood because 
whenever it was some  noise in the town, I had 
been away. So she said to me  after the war that
 she thought that I ma ybe 
have carried -- carried 
the -- the -- the case for -- or th
e rucksack for the saboteur. Sh
e thought I had been a helper.  
Q: Helper. 

A: But she never believed that I was the ma n, you s
ee. So it --  if -- she di
d never think that I was 
able to do any sabotage operations
. So I was an ordinary ma n. 

Q: Tell me  about your conversations when you 
would sit with your -- with your colleagues. 
Were they pr actical conversations, were th
ey political conversations, a combination? 
A: We ll, it was very often not so -- I would sa
y funny things, we were joking very often. We  had 
the -- the humor, very good. And all kinds of joke
s were very popular and for instance, when I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
57 
 
should meet with the whole group of let™s say six,
 seven, altogether, then we usually me t at one 
of the big graveyards in Oslo. There was 
no money -- n-no people there, you know. And that 
could be a very good way. It™s -- for instance, we 
never met in restaurants. We didn™t never meet 
in cafés. It was too dangerous. We  me t in the ope
n, and I can™t recall that the whole group ever 
me t in one apartment. Would be disastrous. 
So some ti me s then, communication between us 
could be difficult, because of that. And that co
ul d -- could easily be some  mi sunderstandings. So 
when we had one operation, we -- the first time th
e ma n that should help us, he had -- he had 
overslept . So he didn™t show up, and we couldn'
t go because he had the fuse. Next time, he 
forgot the fuse, so we -- I was very angry with h
im, I™ve never been so angry in my life, I think. 
So, things like that could happe
n [indecipherable]. But was -- then made it more -- mo re simple, 
more so the nerves could help out with -- they 
would have -- some  had difficulties with their 
nerves, of course, but I had the 
-- we had about 15 operations in 
™44, and then one of the fellows, 
he said, well, he s -- what will ha ppen here?  
Can we come  into trouble and get shot, or  
some thing. Then one other fellow said, no, 24 is with
 us. I had had so much luck, every time , and 
th-they were all -- we had no -- no -- then, 
15 successful operations. So in a way, it was 
dangerous to think that way, but I had the luck. 

Q: Mm-hm. So how would you communicate when
 you were going to do an operation, or you 
had a task that some one should do -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- how would you get the word out so that peop
le would know to meet you in [indecipherable] 
A: Oh, that™s intere
sting. Telephones.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
58 
 
A: Telephones were not tapped in Oslo. I think 
the reason why they coul
dn™t tap all telephones, 
they had the -- the -- Germans had the techni cian
s, they had it, but they we re dependent on 
Norwegian, on Norwegian technicians, all overyou know. They call all --
 these telephone boxes 
were different places. I don™t th
ink they found any technician th
at was a Nazi. So they didn™t 
think of it, and they had thought
 they should do it, but they never did. So you could use the 
telephone, but of course you wouldn™t say, now we
 are going to have sabotage. You didn™t say 
that, but you say, we have to fetch the milk, or we meet in a shop because I got any more bread, 

or maybe a little goat cheese. 
That™s Norwegian usually. So, telephone was very much used. 
Then, that day, they were [indecipherable] then 
we met, and I had all the information, all the 
intelligence, because I had been round there. I 
-- I could be al ways in the open, I was there 
[indecipherable] it. So what important in any mili
tary operation is intelligence before, and -- and 
intelligence very often can be wrong. But I could go 
there and see with my own eyes that it -- it 
was like that. So that was a ve-very important thing. 
Q: Right. 
A: But ma de out on the telephone, very often. 

Q: Let me  go back to January 1943. The -- appa
rently the -- the Gestapo was hunting for you, 
and you -- there was an incident when you came  
back to the apartment in which you were 

staying. Could you describe that incident? 

A: Yes, how -- how would I know that I was want
ed?  I didn™t know. For -- when they had the -- 
when that fellow had given up my na me , real name
, I didn™t know it. So I had, at that time, about 
seven different hidi ng places. I ha d -- in the town
, so I could use several -- several around the 
town. And then at one of these places I had a sm
all house I had hired, or my friend, as a ma tter of 
fact, in -- small house in the ga
s station, you know, slow -- very near the -- the headquarters of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
59 
 
the police, and -- and then the -- 
I didn™t know a thing, I came in from -- I™d been in the woods, I 
think had the little week
end, which I had in the mi ddle of the week. So I came in, it was dark, 
and then when I came to the house, I thought -- ev
erything had to be blinded at that time, every 
house, everyt hing that no light should come out b
ecause of air raids, so on. So -- but I thought it 
wasn™t well done in a way. I felt some thing must
 be wrong. So I didn™t put the key in the door, 
then I would just be shot , because there was some  people waiting for me . And I r-read about this 
afterwards, because Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he
 wrote the report about this. And he was very, 
very angry with the people sitting there, because 
I dis -- I just  -- they didn™t catch me. I -- I rang 
the bell. Then I would -- knew I would have a split second to think what to do. And the -- the 

door was thrown open -- open imme diately and I -- th
ere was a -- I got a pist
ol right in my face. 
And the -- h-he asked me  to come  in, and I said, to
 hell I don™t want to come  in here. And I saw 
two Germans, in -- gendarme s wer -- they were, a
nd with gun -- with rifles, 
and then he -- I tried 
to get my pistol, but then he -- that
 pistol was right in my fac e . So 
I just -- when he yell at me  to 
come in, I said to hell I want to, 
and I hit the pistol, and the -- he
 -- the shot went in the air and 
then the -- I jumped out in the 
dark, and the two Germans shot, th
ey all mi ssed. So then the --  I 
knew it was people there, that -- I 
knew it was people that didn™t li
ke me . So then I went to the 
second, it was only a hundred yards away, my sec
ond place. Then started shooting there, then I 

got away there, and then the -- my es -- taxi  driver
 who drove me  at that time , he said -- he said, 
ﬁI-I don™t think you should go to any 
of these places.ﬂ I said, ﬁI ha
ve to se e at least one more, 
then I know they are sitting everyw
here, but I have to.ﬂ And when I came  down to that flat, they 

had put a safe ty chain inside, so I was warned. So I got away there. But then he -- my -- my taxi 

driver ans -- he said, no, no, no, please no more. So
 I then found an -- a new -- brand new place, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
60 
 
and had a good night™s sleep, no trouble. So 
-- but that -- that night, ma ny, ma ny people are 
arrested, because it was [indecipherable] all over.  
Q: Why was n™t two time s enough for you?  
Why did you have to try the third? 
A: We ll, I had to know, are they sitting ev
erywhere?  What about the rest of them?  
Q: And -- uh-huh. 

A: I had to. I tho -- I had thought 
so, I had to be safe, that they were sitting there. Then I was 
pretty sure they were. And this guards, they we
re -- got into very big 
trouble in front of the 
Gestapo chief. They really got hell, because they had the -- 

Q: Because they mi ssed you. 

A: Yeah. And h-he said in his report, the worst 
thing isn™t that they mi ssed him, but they didn™t 
report to me, so I lost -- I lost 
the whole thing. If they had repo
rted imme diately, we could have 

gone to some other places and got him, but they 
didn™t dare to tell me
 that they had lost. 
Q: I see. 
A: So it was a good thing [indecipherable] frighten
ed by the Gestapo chief, and they got hell. 
Q: So tell me  a couple of things. How did 
you find a hiding place that night?  You had seven 
beautiful -- 

A: Yeah, I knew -- I knew about the me rchant 
-- haberdasher, by the way, and I knew he was 

good -- or a good ma n, so I went up to his place, 
and I said I wanted to
 -- I was welcomed 
immediately. So you would all -- in
 a country like ours, we know 
all -- most people, anti-Nazis, 
you would be supported. But it was also a chance th
at they could have been all of -- arrested 
before that. You could go right into th
e place. But you had the -- you needed luck. 
Q: Wa s this a circumstance where you dr
opped a book?  Your diar
y, or am I wrong? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
61 
 
A: Oh yes, I -- I lost that in 
that little house, and -- but I s 
-- I knew I had put na -- two names on 
that notebook, so I put on some  other clothes an
d after half an hour I went back there. I knew 
they wouldn™t start over 
again, lost -- they lost track of me . 
So I just went right in -- almost 
outside and found it. Two days late
r, they -- it -- you had to try to  think rationally, to say, why -- 
why should I keep staying there? I had disappeare
d, why should I -- well, then you could be safe. 
Q: Did they chase you? 
A: Yes, but that would be done in that mi nut
e. But I disappeared in the darkness, it was 
impossible.  

Q: Were you afraid at all th
at -- at that mo me nt when they shot -- shot at you? 
A: Well, I was -- I was angry. 

Q: You were angry? 

A: Yes. I -- of course, yes [indecipherable] st
upid people. They starte
d up this. And I had no 
respect for that fellow that came 
up there, I -- and we™re -- I -- 
I saw he was nervous, could see it 
imme diately, he™s standing with a pistol like 
that, you know. Very few people are quiet in that 
mome nt, I™m pretty sure. 

Q: So is that why it was so -- easier for you to hit his arm -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- because he in fact 
was shaking [indecipherable] 
A: Yes, a-and it was within my reach. 

Q: Yes. 

A: That™s not a good thing to do wh
en you™re try to hold up a ma n. 
Q: Now, let me  ask you some thing. You were susp
icious when you walked -- this wasn™t outside, 
you were -- you have to go inside to
 the apartment, am I right?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
62 
 
A: No, no, the stair -- 
Q: Or was it outside? 

A: -- it was a small house. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The stairs, right into the open. 

Q: Okay, so -- 

A: So I was standing in front th
ere, it was a little opened, just 
a little wa -- jump down three 
stairs. 

Q: So if you were suspicious, why did you ring the bell? 

A: Well, I wasn™t sure. I 
had a feeling, and you couldn™t stop there, you had to -- 
Q: You had to find out. 

A: You had to know. I could have been 
wrong, I could have been -- I was right.  
Q: So, did this mean -- this se
t of circumstances mean that Fe
hmer, the -- the Gestapo head knew 
more than you had thought he knew? 

A: No [indecipherable] 

Q: So you have -- so now you -- 

A: But he knew -- he knew more or less that 
I knew most people in 
the --  the leaders. 
Q: Right. 

A: He knew that. 

Q: And he now had your name ?  

A: But he called -- he called me  a -- he thought
 I was a spy, no, and -- an
 English spy or -- or 
from the governme nt that had left Norway, which was bad enough for him. So -- but when he 

lost track, he -- he -- then he had my  father
, he thought that was good enough to stop me . But I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
63 
 
don™t know if he -- but I -- he didn™t have any 
[indecipherable] about me
 r eally, until we met 
after the war. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were you able to keep track of your 
father when he was sent
 to the concentration 
camp and he ar how he was, or [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, and the thing was that he was se
nt to a concentration camp in Oslo -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- outside Oslo. So I knew when the car -- they 
were put to some  work in Oslo. So I knew he 

was comi ng with that car, but with German guards, 
of course. I had to be 
way out of sight of it. 
So I knew that. And my - -  I had to try to c
onvince my mother that I was in England. So I 
corresponded with her through Stoc
kholm. So she got letters fr
om a relative in Stockholm, 
saying that she used another name  -- name  for 
a girl. And she -- I wrote her, she knew it was 
from me , from England. I was in Os
lo, but I pretended so she -- I tr
ied to ma ke her believe that I 
was in England. But at one time she came to the bakery. I almost me t her in the stairs, but she 
was sitting in this next  room in the ba kery [inde
cipherabl e] face, all the 
time. Sh -- I was in the 
next room. But that was 
just what could happen. 
Q: And you didn™t want  her to know because
 you didn™t want  her to be afraid? 
A: Exactly, exactly, and get mi xed into it. But fi
rst of all, they were 
afraid, you know, what will 
happen. So that was an idea to keep that way. 
Q: And the Nazis never picked 
up these letters, the Germans? 
A: No. 

Q: They™d never detected anything? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
64 
 
A: We ll, they had the -- the first ni ght she was in the -- when I worked these different pl aces, 
they were there -- she st ayed at one of these pl
aces, and the Ge stapo came  there during the night, 

and so he met my mothe r . He knew it was my mother, so -- 

Q: Fehmer met her, or -- 

A: Yeah, Fehmer himself. 

Q: Hi ms elf. 

A: The Gestapo chief, he  came hi ms elf to that pl
ace, and -- i-in the ni ght. Early -- usua lly like 
came three, four o™clock in the morning so th
ey could do that, p-peopl
e wouldn™t wake up, and 
her -- the friend that she was with, she was take
n to the -- the concentr
ation camp for about two 
years, but because Fehmer asked her did I ever co
me  there, and she said no. And then he -- for 
that lie, you will be -- come to prison, he said. 
But my wife was -- my -- my mother was left 
there.  

Q: Why do you think that was the case? 
A: Well, a -- 
Q: Do you think your father was enough for him? 

A: Yeah, he -- yeah. I guess so. 

Q: And wha t  was the name  of the camp, 
was -- wa -- that your father was in? 
A: That was Grini. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Grini, G-r-i-n-i, Grini. 

Q: Right. 

A: Concentration camp, a -- right outside Oslo. 

Q: Now, when did you figure out that
 this ma n name d Monse n was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
65 
 
A: An informer.  
Q: An informer. Wa s that around this 
time?  After your father was taken? 
A: Yes. He was sent out, and was done in a very 
smart way by the security pol-police. They were 
-- the Germa ns were all afraid of all kinds of sick
nesses, so they put peopl
e in showers, to have 
bath or showers, always. So they had a ma n, wa 
-- one of the prisoners were heading in a bath, 
taking care of all that. They put in an informer
 who took care of all the 
prisoners. And of course 
prisoners would think [indecipherable] why don™t you ta
lk to my -- he™s also a prisoner. So they 
gave him two, three, name s. A friend of mi ne wa
s given up, a-and he -- then
 he was -- came  out 
from prison, pretended they were releasing him. 
So he came up to that [indecipherable] that he 
had heard that from other prisoners, of course, b ecause they believed in him. He was just one of 

them. So they got a telephone, and he telephoned
 my friend, and he wanted to me et my friend, 
and we had to meet him, because it could be 
very valuable information from other prisoner 
friends. So we had to take a chance. Of course
, we didn™t know exactly how it was, but it could 
happen. So we me t him in the evening, outside in 
Oslo, about eight o™clock in the evening, very 
dark in winter. And he started 
to tell us greetings from two pe ople, which were -- later, by the 
way, died in Germany, i n concentration camps. One was a [indecipherable] ma nager in Shell 

company, and then -- but we -- we just didn™t -- we 
had a feeling that he wa
s not in the resistance 
move me nt, we had a -- the way he said it, then we
 understood that -- we were
 pretty sure that he 
was an informer. So Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, 
he was reporting this afterwards, we have it in 
his report. And he -- he said that the -- th
e man was stupid, and my -- my man, he was stupid 
enough to give up his telephone number. And that co
st him his life. So we won at that time. 
Q: So you had Monsen killed? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
66 
 
Q: And who did -- who shot him?  [ind
ecipherable] I don™t know whether --  
A: What a  
Q: -- was he shot? 

A: Yeah, he was shot. 

Q: He was shot. 

A: Part of the group. Some  other -- 

Q: And is this in th
e open, or do they -- 
A: No, at night. They went into his bi -- apartm
ent at ni ght, because they had -- had his telephone 
number, they could find his addre
ss. Otherwise he had -- could ha
ve told -- he didn™t get any 
names from us, but he wa
s very, very dangerous. 
Q: How does one make a decisi on as to
 who will assassinate the informer? 
A: We ll, if he hadn™t been taken that evening, it
 had been too late, next morning it would -- he 

would report to Fehmer and he would say ma ybe  and ma ybe could come  with some  tracks, you 
know. 
Q: No, what I mean is how do you decide who™s going to kill him?  

A: Oh well, that was a -- 

Q: Is -- there™s a volun -- 

A: -- oh, it had to be one of the -- they were di
sciplined, they had -- they
 knew what it cost. So 
one of the group would get that order. 

Q: But they -- it wouldn™t be voluntary necessa
rily, it would be, you should be the one to do it? 
A: Yeah -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- yes, it could be. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
67 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Of course, if you had said, but th 
-- I knew. This was part of the game . 
Q: Of the game .  

A: That was our enemies. When you are in -- at 
the front, you see the enemy over there, but here 
is -- you don™t see him, you just feel him, you -- 
it™s much mo re difficult. 
So it™s just a -- a s -- 
German sol diers fire at American soldiers, just  that. 

Q: Did you -- was it -- wa s there ever a circumstan
ce where -- where people doing that -- it was -
- afterwards they suffered a great deal, even 
though they knew they were killing someone who 
was an enemy, it was -- was it difficult for people to do it, do you think? 

A: We ll, I think for Norwegians it was. And afte
r the war, when I have 
been sitting in a -- in a 
official bureau, taking care of all 
the disabled veterans, and when we discussed this, if a ma n had 
-- had a very bad destiny, and needed a pension, fo
r instance, a disabled pe
rson pension, then this 
would mean some thing, because of hi s nerves, that
 he had been through that. It was me ntioned as 
a very hard thing to do. On the front it™s ma ybe a 
little different, but -- but 
you were also face to 
face in the front in a war, so -- 
Q: But this is more face to f
ace, you™re going into some body™s  -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- apar tment, into a living -- 

A: It is. 

Q: -- it™s di fferent. 

A: It is. 

Q: Right. 

A: So, it was considered a very tough thing [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
68 
 
Q: In May of 1943, you™re -- you™re sent to Britain. 
A: Yes, for -- 

Q: Now, ha ve you been trying to
 get to Britain for awhile? 
A: No, I hadn™t -- I hadn™t time .  

Q: No. 

A: I had no time . I had to do my ossage -- office 
job for them in Oslo. But then when it was 
during the dark hours and days, it was easier, but 
then I was wa rned by the -- our secret -- we 
have also secret police agents, few of them, th
ey ha -- they were a group, and they warned me , 
and they said, you better get out this summer. They
 are after you all the time,
 so please get out of 
Norway for the summer. Then I went over to Stockholm, and I was asked inter -- invited to come  

over to this special operations executive traini
ng camps, trained in that company, so we -- 
Q: That™s the SOE group. 

A: -- yeah, and we then reached the independent
 company, number one, that was the name. Also 
under Norwegian control. 

Q: But when you go over there, they do a very he
avy security check. This is when you describe 
you™re writing down the [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, and I -- I could -- they -- they said 
to me , don™t use your name  over here, it could be 
German spies. So that -- they asked me  to put
 ano -- another name , the Erling Fjeld name . So I 
came over as Erling Fj eld, it was only two people in
 the British secret service that knew it -- 
security force, that knew who I was, and I -- soI had to pretend to be Erling Fjeld for six m -- 

four months. Born in ™16. 

Q: 1916? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
69 
 
Q: So you™re a little old. 
A: First March 16. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That was the -- the date, I reme mb er it ve
ry well. That wasn™t my real birthdate. 
Q: Right. And where -- where was Erling born? 

A: I was born in Oslo. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And my father, he 
had a -- a small shop. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I think his -- his wife -- and my mother 
was Margda, I thought that was a nice name , so I 
built up the whole thing there. So I had to go back
 to swe -- to Norway, and then when I came to 
the border, Swedish border, I came  there as a re
fugee called Erling Fjeld.
 And then I was given 
the papers in Stockholm, and then I wa s wanted also
 in Sweden. So that™s why I, in one of them, 
that Erling Fj eld picture, I put in 
-- on the scarf, and a couple of window gl asses, and -- just to be 
safe, and I went through that controlin Sweden without 
being discovered.  

Q: Tell me , when you were in this training -- wa
 -- a few things I would like to know. When you 
have this new identity, and you can create 
my father, my mot her, where I was born. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: When people ask you things about your
 life, do you ma ke up everything?  We r -- 
A: No, no, that you could use your ordinary life. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Take -- pick another town. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406

A: For instance, you could pick a town on the west
 coast, which was also industrial town, could 
have been just the same . So you had to pick thin
gs that™s real so you -- 
you didn™t need to -- to 
ma ke it up. You tried to find things tha -- that wa
s there. So you couldn™t 
always -- that was the 
way to reme mber.  
Q: Tell me  about the training. After a few weeks,
 you passed the security check, right?  And then 
in June, you go to Scotland, I think? 

A: Yeah, and we had a traini
ng camp with only Norwegians. 
Q: Only Norwegians. 

A: Yeah, on that -- that camp. The ot hers were 
all people comi ng from all Europe, from occupied 
countries, but here we were 
together, and about 30 me n for  
two months, very hard, tough 
training, day and night. And we had 
learned all kinds of sabotage. 
Q: That was the -- that  was the point of the trai ning -- 

A: Yeah, yeah -- 
Q: -- sabotage. 
A: -- by then. 

Q: Now -- 

A: I had difficulties over there because I ha
dn™t the right discipline to be in the -- 
Q: Yes, can you explain that? 

A: -- I had a little trouble there.
 We l l , I -- they didn™t know that I had been in the resistance 
move me nt for two, three years as one of the leaders. They didn™t know that
, they thought I was a 
young fellow comi ng. Erling Fjeld, they never heard a
bout him, so they tried to ma ke him be a 
little more disciplined. But I had di ffi culties. I -- bu
t a -- first of all, so I di dn™t do very well in 
the s -- that school, but I had the best ma rks in sa
botage. I knew that was what I needed. The rest 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
71 
 
of them, I could actually teach them. So that™s
 why, between the leader and me  it was a little 
trouble.  
Q: But your ma in purpose was 
to learn explosives -- 
A: Exactly. 

Q: -- anyway, so that you could do that. 

A: The rest I knew. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I knew they couldn™t -- he couldn™t learn 
me  anything. He didn™t know. And he didn™t know I 
had been in resistance for two and a half year. 

Q: And does he want you out of there?
 Does he try and sort of flunk you?  
A: Yes, he said I wouldn™t -- I -- I couldn™
t be used. But when I came to London, I knew, of 
course, so -- so it™s not often that it -- it -- 
it -- use -- useful ma n can be a good -- good pupil. 
Q: And who -- you had a friend, how -- Haugland is his name , Knut?  Who -- 
A: Yes, I had a very good friend from my home
t own. He wa s later on the wireless operator on 
the Kon-Tiki fleet, the raft.  
Q: A -- a what kind of operator? 

A: He was wireless operator together with [i
ndecipherable] later on, because he needed some  

relaxation after the war, because he had so much
 headache. So he joined [i ndecipherable] on the 
Kon-Tiki. He lost all his 
troubles with -- after that 
trip with the raft, Kon-Ti
ki. So Knut and I, we 
were close friends from Rjukan, and then he
 knew me , of course, 
he knew my na me  and 
everythi ng. So he helped the leadership in England to get me  over, because to send pe ople back, 

it cost lots of money, you know, it 
-- it -- you had to send what they
 pretend to be the best. So -- 
but the leadership in London, they -- they 
knew, so they wanted me  to go back.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
72 
 
Q: It wasn™t so easy to
 get back though, was it? 
A: No, it was -- you had to really 
-- you know, they put up a plane, it was terribly expensive, was 
a big thing, you know, a four engine
 bomber, Halifax bomber, or 
could be an [indecipherable] 
American, and sent back to Norway. So they had to
 try to find the best to send, or the ones they 
knew could do some thing.  
Q: So you parachuted back -- 

A: Yes, back -- 

Q: -- after a couple tr
ies, back into -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: And you parachuted with weapons, or -- 

A: With all kinds of weapons. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I had Knut, we came together. 
Q: You and Knut? 
A: Knut Haugland, and we had in our planes, we  ha
d a -- almost two tons of weapons with us, in 
small parachutes that was dropped toge
ther with us, two tons of weapons. 
Q: And whe r e in Norway would they be dropped?  Towards the coast? 

A: That was the very -- in the mi ddle of Norwa
y, called -- a very neat place called Kongsberg. 

And then I dropped right there in the mountains. 

Q: And there there were people -- agents 
who were picking thes
e things up, right? 
A: Yes, we did that, we had some  of the farmers came with sledges, you know, in winter and 

picked them up by horses, sledges. And they ha
d them down t o -- to the road, the ma in road, 
where we could pick them up. For instance, in my 
way I -- I had the very cl
ose friend in the -- in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
73 
 
the gas company, and we had their truck, their tank 
truck, and we filled -- put all the weapons in 
that truck -- tank wagon, and people -- when we
 came running, came on the road, they didn™t 
believe it could be weapons on 
the tank, you know, in the tank. Thought it was gasoline, so now 
we could be fooling the Germans,
 not the opposite. So some  fun 
-- some time s we™re -- we™re the 
cat, and then they™re mi ces. 
Q: So when you ga -- came back, once -- did you go 
back to Oslo after y
ou had parachuted into 
Kongsberg? 

A: Yes, I go -- went imme diately back, and I did not
hing in the fi rst two week
s. I want to get to 
know a -- all -- to be -- find out
 what had happened, so -- 
Q: So were you away for a year? 

A: Yeah, then I had been -- 

Q: Al most a year? 

A: No, I had been away for -- for five months, you know. 
Q: Five months. 
A: Yeah. So now I was back where 
I could -- I really liked to be.  
Q: So after a couple of weeks, did you ma ke
 the first decision about the first sabotage? 
A: Yeah, I stayed two -- two weeks before, so I 
get used to the climate. A clam -- a clam -- a 
[indecipherable]. So I knew then I could start again. Met my people, what™s the situation now, 

where are the controls, how can you -- where can 
you stay, where -- what can you do?  I was -- so 

I was just relaxing there for 14 days
, then I could st
art over again. 
Q: And whe r e did you stay?  Did you get a new set of -- 

A: You know, then I stayed with a -- a doctor at one
 of the hospitals, big hos
pitals. And then I -- 
I was to find a place for my friend, Knut Haugland 
as a wireless operator. So he™s put -- came  to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
74 
 
that same  hospital, a -- he  took over my place, 
and he was in -- sending all his me ssages on the 
top floor of the hospital. And then I found so
me  other pl aces, new places, another five, 10 new 
places where I can di sappear completely, and -- 
under some name, some new name, could be 
Knutsen too. That™s why one day we were very, 
very -- little stupid, because we had both put the 
name  Knutsen. So when I me t my friend, he said 
to me , ﬁ Who are you? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI™m Knutsen.ﬂ 
ﬁAnd I™m Knutsen.ﬂ I said. So then it was Knutsen one and Knutsen two. But in -- in two months 
we had different name s again. 

Q: Wa s your first operation the bombing of the labor office? 

A: No, it™s -- yeah, yeah, I would say so, it was th
e first where I was -- had that chance, and that 
was in open daylight. You had --where they ha
d conscripted the [indecipherable] meeting the 
next day, next morning, about ni
ne o™clock and they wanted us
 to blow up the place -- 
Q: Can you expla -- 

A: -- in the evening. 
Q: Can you explain why it was so important  to 
-- to do some thing at the La bor Office? What 
were the Nazis trying to do at this time?  
A: See, they were trying to deal with a lot of
 Norwegians, several thousands, could be quite a 

percentage for all the youngsters. And they wanted
 them to be conscripted for labor. But it was a 
concealed conscription for army, for German ar m
y. And the long week -- it was very hard to stop 
it, it was, of course that was sent over th
e radio, BBC radio, Norwegian broadcast to Norway, 
please don™t go in there, don™t -- 
don™t report. But if th
ey didn™t report, they
 -- all the youth, 18 -- 
between 18 and 22, they would be fetched -- they
 would be taken by the police, would -- could 
be shot or put in a concentration camp. So it didn™t
 help them to refuse. But in Oslo they were 
supposed to meet 3,000 in ™44, spring ™44, 19
th
 May, they were supposed to meet. 18
th
, the day 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
75 
 
before, I was asked -- it was my first job, I was 
asked to -- they ene -- in the evening, same  
evening, blow up the office, and it wa s in -- in No
rway it™s very light in 
May, it™s -- almost all 
night. So about eight o™clock inthe evening we went up there, and had a -- some  explosives, 14 
pounds of explosives. And then we just -- in a sm
all parcel. And then th 
-- we thought it was very 
easy to do this, but it was about 20 people wo
rking overtime, because they should have  3,000 
people next morning. So I said to my  friend, I can
not kill these people, 
I don™t -- we cannot do 
that, that™s not our job. Our job is to ruin it. 
So I shouted -- went up to
 -- in the house, and I 
shouted as hi gh as I could, get the hell out of 
there. Two mi nutes the 
house will be -- the whole 
thing will be blown up. And they all got out in 
a split second, more or 
less . All of them. And 
when we came out, it was only less than one mi nut
e before it exploded, so -- then the next 

morning, nobody could meet there. I had a feeling that
 the -- I™d heard from 
some historians that 
three pe ople went instead of 3,000. And they had 
troubles because the stairs wasn™t there any 

more. So we were lucky. And this helped. Ne
xt day they knew three -- 3,000 should me et, but 
they had no place to me et. So that was start, we
 made several sa botage operations s-so we could 
help this, and it was stopped, fina
lly. After six mo nths, they gaveup. So we -- we sent a ti -- sent 
in 5,000 youngsters [indecipherable] means quite a 
lot to people [indecipherable] three million. 
Quite a big percentage. 

Q: We re there a number of sabota -- was the Labor Office in Oslo the ma jor -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- center? But there must 
have been centers all over. 
A: No -- yeah, that was always done. But no 
-- Oslo was so terribly important, because 
everything was centerized. The pol
iticians today say -- they comp
lain that we are centerized 
today, but at that time it was all 
centerized. Every town in Norway, if they needed even change 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
76 
 
their house, you had to go right to 
the -- to the headquarters in Oslo. 
So it meant so much. So this 
was mostly done in Oslo. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So it meant very much for the whole country. 
You could use a telephone all over the country. 
So it spread. 

Q: Really? 

A: That somebody was now hitting the Gestapo. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they were disappearing, hitting, ruining 
for them, and disappeared, all the time . So of 
course it was -- was not very nice for th
e Gestapo, really. They got into trouble. 
Q: Okay, we™ll take a break now. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
77 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Mr. Sonsteby, before we go on and talk abou
t some  other sabotage operations, let™s get a 
pictur e of how many Ger mans there are to every 
Norwegian in -- in the country at  this time. 
A: We were, at that time, three million people.
 And we had in from ™42 - ™43, we had about 
250,000, later on more than 300,000 troops. It was 10 
percent of all the 
population. And if you 
take the age of -- the military 
age, which was an important 17 - 
18 to 32 - 34, then it was -- in 
southern Norway it was about thr
ee Germans to a Norwegian. And in 
north Norway, very little -- 
it was not so ma ny people, we had -- it could be 
about 10 Germans to a Norwegian in that age 
group. So [indecipherable] swarme d in [indecipherable] 
Q: So when you were walking around in
 Oslo during your daily meetings -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- did you always see a lot of troops? 

A: Oh yes, all the time. But I 
didn™t care, I thought that they 
didn™t touch me, and I didn™t touch 
them. So, just like that, especially you were 
always -- all the contro
ls, you know, and when you 
consider Norwegians, they were 
being traitors, they ha
d the -- some  of th
em had the control. 
They were one ma n with a machine pistol, and 
it was five others, youngsters, Nazi boys with 
rifles. And then you were stopped, they looked in
 your pockets and in your -- your vest -- what 
do you call these small things you have?  Suitcases
, and briefcases and looked through them, 
opened. And if you saw them, and you tried to ge
t away, and you didn™t stop, you would be shot. 
They shot immediately these 
youngsters, young Norwegians. That was very bad to see, you 

know. And they were Nazis and they didn't understa
nd what they did. So it could even be on the 
[indecipherable] gosh that ma n -- if you then just
 moved another, they would stop you. And if 
you didn™t stop imme diately, got shot.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
78 
 
Q: A -- A few weeks after you bombed the Labor Office, you were supposed to blow up an 
insurance company building, why? 

A: Well, they used some  kind of a -- in order to 
call in people, they had 
to use what you call -- I 
won™t -- I don™t know what you call 
it in English, but all the insura
nce companies had -- is a kind 
of starting up of data system. They c ould sort 
out things on new machines from the States. And it 
was, of course, the company that had this, that 
was IBM. At that time  in Norway, it had another 
name , the company, and they had these machines. 
And these machines were now put in to sort 
out people to find the addresses. They were sorted
 like anything is. It was a first kind of data -- 
data machine, I think, data. And then the Germ
ans and the Norwegian -- the Nazi government, 
they wanted to use this. I got the order to take it, 
to destroy it before they 
could start. So the first 
-- the machines, they were -- they were in a nice 
shop in Oslo, and one mo rning we heard that it -
- they will be taken over by the Gestapo. So the 
day before, we came there, and we had a big 
stone through the window, and had three small ch
arges of -- of explosives, and there were no 
more after a mi nute. Then we disappeared comple
tely. The next day they -- we had forgotten a 
big machine up in the insurance 
company. And then we had got th
e new order to go up there and 
take that. And then they had put four guard
s around the machine with a police dog. Now they 

were sure it will not be taken, and the Gesta
po and the -- they were hundred percent sure nobody 
could come  there. So it was impossible, but we
 found a new way. If it had been now we would 
have ma ybe used a helicopter, bu
t you didn™t have helicopter at 
that time , so we had to crawl 
over three, four roofs, until we reached that building and got down there, and the --  there we 

knew it was -- the machine was under the -- the di
ning room, or the room where the fella -- the 
employees had their meal. And during the night we
 came, we reached it, and put the explosive, 
that would 10 -- it was a delayed bomb, 10 mi nute
s, and then we went back, we -- if you then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
79 
 
went into the streets about 10:
30, you would be taken, it was Germ
an gua rd all over town during 
the night. Also because of these sabotage operatio
ns. If we came into the street, we would be 
arrest ed imme diately, our age. So
 we wen-went into the next bu
ilding and had a fine view to 
where the explosion will go off and 10 mi nutes af
terwards, again we -- we didn™t want to take 
lives, so we called them again on the telephone, 
we said, two mi nutes, yo
u™d better get out. And 
they knew from experience now, so they all got ou
t, even with the dog, and then it was blown up, 
the whole thing. And next morning they coul
dn™t find anybody, no track whatsoever, which was 
a very important thing. We didn™t 
lose people, I didn™t lose any of
 my me n, and it was a -- should 
called a success.  

Q: You mus t  have driven them crazy.  

A: I think it was not so easy to bear. Not to 
find a track, it was impossible. And of course it 
meant that the people also, they didn™t talk. They knew they had -- shouldn™t talk about it. Of 

course it was wonderful for them
 to hear about it, and when I 
came the next day, I went down in 
the district and talked to people a
nd they said, oh, terrible people that™s done this. So -- but it was 
very popular, of course, within 
the population because they kn
ew it was a fight towards the 
Gestapo first of all, and to stop this conscription of our young pers
ons. So in -- in the course of 
™44 summer, autumn, it was all stopped. They ga
ve up. And another thin
g, politically, Germans 
some ti me s found that these Norwegian Nazis weren'
t always so good. So they were -- they were 
now annoyed that they didn™t ma ke it and put [ind
ecipherable] Gestapo in trouble. So they were -
- it could be a little -- for us it 
was very important that it was 
a g -- not good relations between 
the Germans and the Nazi Norwegians. That could also be a point.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
80 
 
Q: Now, I guess it was about a month later, in 
the Lysaker factory, ther
e -- you -- you blew up, 
was June 28
th
, 1944, there was another bombing that you 
did. Was it following that that the 
Nazis retaliated in terms of the ration cards? 
A: Yes, every Norwegian over 16 years old had 
to have a ration card. And then these youngsters, 
they were all -- they were all refused to fetch 
the cards. And then we -- 
I was asked to steal a 

few, to real -- ma ke it a hold-up. 

Q: Now wai t  a mi nute, wait a mi nut
e, ex -- go back a little bit. 

A: Yes -- 

Q: What were -- what were the Nazi
s doing with the card
s that if you -- 
A: They refused to give the cards to 
-- to the youngsters of 18 - 19 - 20 - 22. 
Q: Because they wanted to conscript them? 

A: Exactly. 

Q: I see. 
A: Then they would have to report. If they didn™
t get a card, they had to report, that wa s the 
way.\ 

Q: Okay. 

A: And then I was asked to -- to put up a hold 
up, to take over 75,000 ra
tion -- ration cards, and 
that was one and a half ton. So it was not a pocket 
theft, it wa s a real [ind
ecipherable]. So we -- it 
was comi ng out from the  printing shop with gua
rds, the whole truck, and we  stopped it. In 
Norway y-you have a han -- it™s right driving you know, we have left and right, Norway was 

right. And then you can stop the 
car. My car came and stopped th
e other one, because it had 
stopped because of the right of way. So then we 
-- I took over the car. 
I just opened the front 
door of the truck and said, let me  have a place here, 
I don™t want to sit here 
in front. So I put my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
81 
 
gun in the side of the watchman, of t he guard, an
d he moved imme diately. And at the same  ti me , 
two of my friends went up on the -- on the plat
form, on the truck, where it was two other guards, 
so the car was ours. We took it ov
er, the whole thing, with the one 
and a half ton of ration cards. 
That was -- then we met another car, which I di
dn™t know the number pl
ates, I didn™t know 
anything, I knew exact at 9:30 we 
will meet another car, I stoppe
d there, and i -- all ration card 
got taken over to the other truc
k, and that disappeared. If we we
re now arrested or taken, we 
didn™t know where to find the cards. They could 
have tortured us, but we didn™t know. That was 
also important at that time. So -- 

Q: So then what happened?   

A: Then the -- some  of our leaders, they had 
a telephone to the authorities, one way line. And 
the-they told the authorities, now we have -- we 
have the cards, we want to ma ke a deal with 
you. And they say, what™s your -- what™s your a
ddress?  We ll, we haven™t got any address. 
What™s your telephone?  We haven™
t got any telephone. But we want you to give a new order that 
the youngsters should have the ca
rds -- have their ration cards. 
And th -- how -- why did they 
give in? Yes, they gave in because at this ti
me, Germans were building up that most important  
fort in Europe. That™s the stronge
st fort in Norway -- Norway from
 this time  on. So if it had been 
an invasi on, had been terrible to take back No
rway. Would have cost millions, ma ybe. And then 

we said, we are going to send thes
e cards all over, sell them to ma
ke the black market way and it 
will ruin your situation, the w
hole station here. What about pe
ople working on your fortress, and 
all that?  They would have no -- 
no food, nothing. It would 
be terrible. It w
ould ruin the whole 
situation here. And then the Nazi government, 
Norwegian, they had to give  in, because  the 
Germans would be furious if their 
laborers, all those, di
dn™t get any food at all, it will stop all 
work. So they gave in. We had won. That wa
s in September ™44. They tried once more to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
82 
 
conscript the lady -- the wome n, but that didn™t work
 at all. So we didn't hear any more. And our 
office, without address, without telephone
s, just disappeared from the Nazis. 
Q: And then once they agreed, you gave back the cards? 
A: Yes. Of c ourse, this was done by another gr
oup, but I worked closely with them. I didn™t do 
that part of it, but my part 
was to get hold of the cards. 

Q: But that giving back process 
could also be dangerous because 
they could then catch the group 
A: Oh yes, that -- you are quite 
right, but the way we did it, we ll we just gave them first 20,000 
cards and then they -- we said, you can pi
ck them up outside the bank, for instance. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then part of it we put in small parc
els, and on top of them we wrote, dangerous 

explosives. And it was put round in
 Oslo and it was a hell of a tr
ouble for the police, the Nazi 
police, and they didn™t dare to touch them. So 
they sent for a company outside, an -- German 
specialists to -- on the -- to take
 over, and then they opened it very carefully, and it was ration -- 
ration cards. So we had a little fun also. But of 
course we were -- ma n -- ma ny peopl e into this, 
and -- but it was all coordinate
d very well from t he top. 
Q: Now, in s -- in August of 1944, there was a bomb
ing at Korzewall, with the airplane parts? 
A: Yes, that was an important place, it was ve
ry hard to find because the German camo uflaged it 
with a very big [indecipherable] very big, you know
, the biggest in Norway. And half of it was 
put into st ock of all kinds of spec-special  re-repair part s for --  for fi ghter planes, Messerschmitt. 

And they had also a-about -- about 20 fuselage that
 was there, to put -- put up to the airport later 
on, and we got to know it, and it was very hard 
to know where it was and what they did, but we 

had to get intelligence, a
nd one of my friends, he got to know all 
of it. So then we went in there, 
and the part -- the Norwegian part was no gua
rded, strangely enough. Wa s one guard, which I by 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
83 
 
the way took -- had -- took hold of when we came 
there in the night and pacified him. And then 
we went in there and then went into the German
 part in the baseme nt, through three fe nces, and 
put down about 300 pounds of dynamite. We  bl ew up th
e whole place. And I think it wasn™t very 
nice for them to use their spare parts in Norway. 
And the same  had to be 
done with ball bearing. 
Ball bear ing was terribly important for any na
tion. And Swe dish -- Swed
en had the best ball 
bearings in the world, you know, they had also 
a small place in Oslo, which was also bl own up. 

Another thing what -- how -- how w
ould we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk 
about submarines. Submarines use batteries. Submar
ines batteries, that 
means sulfur, the acid. 
And we had two of them in Norway, so the wa
y we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the 
submarines was to ruin these two acid factorie
s, and they were stopped. So they couldn™t produce 
any more, they were ruined for the rest of the 
war, and then it was not -- very few batteries 
comi ng from Norway to -- norw -- to submarines, 
because  at the coastline in Norway, during the 
war you could hide every nation™s fleet, submarines and everything, in Norwegian fjords. You 
could have the whole -- the worl
d could be placed into Norwegian fjords. And they did, of 
course, all those submarines, they
 disappeared in Norwegian fjords
. So they were -- it was very 
important to hit them in a way 
of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries. Then you had to have 
experts to help you [indecipherable]
. But when we talked about Haugland, he was also wireless 
operator on the heavy water operation, and on myhome town. And so he had a [indecipherable] 

experience. Two s-s-small town -- two 
s mall town boys were also there. 
Q: You said you pacified the guard. Is
 that another word for killing hi m?  

A: No. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
84 
 
A: Just to hold him up, and just keep watching 
him, or one man had to watch him all the time. 
But the trouble with that, of c
ourse, if he doesn™t start scr
eaming. And people ma ybe done that, 
without helping it.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So that could be a -- then, when you hearabout guards being -- you can shoot him, because of 

the noise. So when you hear about that, it™s a 
-- a necessity, because they can give a noise, 
scream or some thing like that, but he -- luck
ily he didn™t. So he was a -- sent out -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Afterwards. So we tried to be very careful with
 the civi lian at all. It
 was not our -- we were no 
terrorists. The Germans called us, of course, te
rrorists, but I -- I -- 
I don™t know any type or 
[indecipherable] which was terrorism. 

Q: And in that operation at th
e air -- at Korzewall, there 
were cleaning wome n who us ed 
[indecipherable] 
A: Yes, that was another difficu
lt thing, of course, when you come
 into a place like that, if you 
had -- if you had the cleaning wome ns and I had paci
fy them in a way that -- I said that we were 
now -- you know, on all buses, you have different adve
rtising, and I said I 
was a painter, so I 
should paint some  of the buses with the -- and th ey believed me . I -- I looked very innocent, and 
they said, he™s a nice painter. So
 then I -- then I -- when I saw a
ll the explosives being carried in, 
I said, this is meat. So this is -- go to 
your -- your people in the 
-- with all the buses 
[indecipherable] it will be fine. So they believed
 me , but whe n they talked, and -- but then I had 
to tell them, I™m very sorry, but it -- now it w
ill be blown up, you come with us. So -- but they 

could stop the whole operation, you know, if they ha
d started. So that was not a way to be 

innocent, try to ma ke people believe. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
85 
 
Q: And wha t  was their response when you said to
 them, essentially, I wa
s lying to you, it™s now 
going to be blown up, get out. We re they a
ngry at you, were they frightened of you? 
A: Oh no, they were frightened. 
Q: They were frightened. 

A: Like hell, of course, which 
is understandable, under -- but th
ey got out. They couldn't  -- 
nobody hurt them afterwards. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: They couldn™t do anything. But people, when 
they see and hear abou
t explosions, you know, 
fuses burning, it™s very understand
able that they are frightened. 
Q: Right. 

A: It™s -- it™s a 
good thing, I think. 
Q: We re you with Haugland at the 
heavy water operation, or no -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- was he alone?  I me an, was -- 
A: I was then in Oslo, and they were trained in
 -- specially on that targ
et in England, by some  
Norwegian professors that had really installed th
e heavy water pl ant at Rj
ukan. It™s part of the 
electr -- electrolyses. Th
at™s part of it, you get the heavy water from the -- 
Q: And was he hurt at that operation? 

A: No, no, he just -- he -- 
he was -- the operat -- operator 
[indecipherable] to keep the 
[indecipherable] London advised all 
the time, do they go in now?   
Q: Right. 

A: And then he had to keep away so he could, if 
they had been lost, he had the report, so he was 
keeping in touch with the -- Engl
and all the time , during operation. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
86 
 
Q: I wanted to ask you about one mo re sabotage 
before we went back to England, which -- your 
group became  known a s  the Oslo gang -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- right a-around this time , in 1944. 

A: Or also detachme nt, I said the name  then, but -- 

Q: Detachment? 

A: Yeah, in Norway it™s a gang, see, which is -- can be -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- mi sunderstood, I think. 

Q: But in England it was know
n as the Oslo detachme nt? 
A: Yeah, that -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- was the British name for it. 
Q: But you -- there was a decision ma de to 
destroy thousands of gallons of oil. 
A: Yeah, that was, of course, also necessary becau
se - -  especi al l y t he spec
ial oils for -- could be 
lubricating oils, which wa s very important, veryscarce. You know, the Germans, they really, in 
the last part, they had no lubri
cating oil, they had no 
gasoline, it was just -- some  part of their 
Panzer, you know, couldn™t work because they hadn™t 
any more -- so that, it was very scarce. So 
to ruin any gasoline tanks, or l
ubricating, was very important, that
 was part of how you could hit 
the Germans. But as I said before, the real effo
rt in Norway™s war was the sailors and the -- or 
that was the real thing, but so
 -- but everything you could do ag
ainst the occupying powers in 
Norway would, of course help -- help out. 

Q: So you destroyed about 50,000 gallons of
 oil in that operation, am I right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
87 
 
A: Well, it could be, but it was more from th
e small groups, they did ma ny, all over Norway. 
Q: On that day? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Not -- not on that day, but [indecipherable] occasionally. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That was done by several groups. So I -- I don
™t know how much it would be, enormous. It 
was ruined, especially al
l the stocks in Norway. 
Q: Now why did you leave Oslo in Nove mber of 
1944?  You went back to be more highly trained 
than you were? 

A: Ah -- yeah, I wanted to report now in Engla
nd, in London. So I -- then I went over with a n -- 
third name . My name  was this time Harald Sorensen. When I came to England I had good 

papers, when I came to the security police -- in
 England you can think in a wartime, security 
police, and I got in now a-at the 
thi --  in the third, after third name, Harald Sorensen, electrical 
engineer. So then it was a very 
few people that, of course -- in th
ere, so we  [indecipherable] that 
I was let in. Could be a dange
rous [indecipherable], I guess. 
Q: Mm. So you took a cour -- an 
STS 17 course, is that right? 
A: Yeah, that means -- no, I didn™t, I -- I went up 
there because my course that had be en before, 
so I just reported over there, to -- to try what
 happened, what about th e experience did I have, 
with the things I had learned in Great Britai
n. So that was a special course in sabotage. 
Q: Now at -- during that period of time  wh
en you were in London, you met with the crown 
prince, and the king? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
88 
 
Q: That the case? 
A: Because -- 

Q: And wha t  was that meeting about? 

A: The sa -- the king heard about th
is country, and of course he ha
d not been in Norway for four 
winters now. And when he heard that I was ther
e for the -- number 24, he knew. And then he 

asked me  to come  up to there to see him. Of c
ourse, it was very nice to meet them. And then the 
king said to me , ﬁ What™s your name  today, Er
ling Fjeld? ﬂ They laughed a little, you see, and 
then I said, ﬁNow today, your ma jesty, my na me  is 
Harald Sorensen, electric
al engineer.ﬂ And he 
-- I -- if I had invite him to go back to the re
sistance in Norway, he ma y have followed. But he 
was a tall man, so it would be really strange 
if you had seen the Norwegian king up and down the 

ma in street in Oslo. 

Q: Right. 

A: But he -- he had really en-enjoy this, of c
ourse. But on the other hand, if -- when we talk 
about Oslo and all, he was nearly crying. It was 
very serious to him, but he couldn™t go back, and 
then -- but then after six months
, in June ™45, he could go back. 
Q: What was that like for you to
 sit with the king of your c
ountry?  Wa s that extraordinary? 
A: Oh, very, very special, of course. So I then 
didn™t realize it, I think, 
because all things were 
quite serious, so -- but it 
-- it was -- it was nice. 
Q: Was the crown prince th
ere as we ll, during that? 
A: Not at that day. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The other day. I me t him with the others. Then
 he was commander in chief for all forces -- 
Q: For all forces. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
89 
 
A: -- Norwegian forces. 
Q: I see. 

A: From tha t  time.  

Q: Then you went back to Oslo in December of 1944? 

A: Yes, with two new men, two new -- 

Q: And is this a -- 

A: -- me mbe r s from the Oslo detachment. 

Q: And what™s the situation for resistance when 
you come  bac k?  I mean, is it harder, are the -- 
are the Germans being -- 

A: Oh, it -- it was harder, and the Gestapo was ve
ry hard, it was -- it was terribl y hard, terribly 
tough. Many, ma ny people are shot, ma ny peopl e ar
e put in concentratio
n camps and now we 
heard more than rumors what happened to them 
in Germany, but not exactly what happened. We  
knew it was tough, but even in December we didn™
t realize. It wasn™t realized before the 
Americans came to the first camps. So we -- we 
couldn™t believe it, and in
, of course, summer, it 
was not easy because they knew I was one of their 
leaders, and I very often got telephones, have 
you heard from my s-son, have you -- have you -- 
my father, and -- and the -- it was about 
10,000, you know, that™s -- for a nation of three millions, 
it™s quite a lot. But it coul dn™t -- some 
people -- some  countries in Norway -- in Europe was worse, you know. 
Q: Am -- am I correct that one of your last
 sabotage operations wa
s March 1945, you call it the 
Operation Ce me nt Mixer? 

A: Yes, because the Germans really had a count
erattack in the Ardennes [indecipherable] that 
often [indecipherable] it was calle
d on, it was really tough, because 
it cost the allied -- I think 
one place you lost 75,000 Americans in that [indeci
pherable]. And lots of people, and then this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
90 
 
will be reinforced by troops. We  had -- Hitler had fr esh troops in Norway. And he -- they had 
some  of the troops that had left Finland -- 
you know, Finland turned around and kicked the 
German out, you know. They came over to Norway, all of them, so it was some  of t he best 

armi es in Germany, still, and now they shipped them down to Oslo, and shipped them over to -- 

soon as possible to Germany, to reinforce this o
ffensive -- the [indecipherable] that offensive. 
But then the order came  out that try to ruin -- 
stop the railways, north 
- south going railways, try 
to sabotage it, try to derail trains
 and all that. And then the [i ndecipherable] all the repair thing 
was done by -- by as -- the central office in Oslo. 
To repair the railroads, there were all the 
people there, so then I wa s asked to blow up th
e whole admi nistration bu
ilding. So it would ruin 
their effort to repair and build it up again. 
And that was done, blown up, completely destroyed, 
all of it. And then the [indecipherable] the gar --
 it was guarded usually very well, it wa s about 
six, 10 guards there. One ma n was sitting behind a 
glass door, but we got -- we got hold of him, 
and -- but he s -- started shouting, as I told you befo
re, so I -- so we had to -- I was going to take 
him out -- outwards, but he shouted, tried to -- to
 warn the rest of the guard, but he -- then you 
had to -- of course, to shoot him, and the guards,
 you couldn™t think of those guards. They had th 
-- but they were our enemies, a
ll of them. We  hadn™t invited them to Norway. So they say that 
we stopped about -- it wa s four divi
sions trying to be se
nt to Germany, a nd I think, I™m not sure 
historically that we stopped about two and a ha
lf division comi ng to reinforcement in Germany.  
Q: And around the country they were blow
ing up railroad tracks and offices -- 
A: All the wa y. 

Q: All over? 

A: Yeah, all over, especially 
a trai n where railways were, so they derailed and all that . 
Q: And I guess timing here was very -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
91 
 
A: Yeah, it™s true -- 
Q: -- significant, because whe 
-- of where the w -- the allies we
re comi ng, so they can more 
quickly stop -- 

A: Yeah, and -- 

Q: -- and there was no chance to rebuild. 

A: And of c ourse, the Ge rmans, they came as 
a shock to the Germans be cause it was all done 
eight o™clock in the evening, 14
th
 March ™45. And by the way, on my father™s birthday. So I -- it 
was a good gift, when he was in 
prison, it was a good gift to give. 
Q: And did he find out about it while he was in prison? 

A: No -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- I -- I doubt it, at that ti
me . He ma y have, a little later. 
Ru mors were going all the time.  
Q: Right. 
A: So -- 
Q: The war ends May eighth, but on March sixth,
 the Oslo detachme nt or gang, and Milorg, go 
and get the archives, yes?  Two days before the end. 

A: Yes, and then I was again, because a -- it -- Ge
rman Gestapo and a Norwegian Nazis, that are 
burning all archives, started wi -- two, three days 
before the -- Norway was taken over, and then 
-- then we got the -- the order -- 
it was a order, we were under orders from the -- I got the order 
to try to -- try to st -- not to stop it, but to 
get hold of the archives, be
fore they burnt them. We 
were lucky, we went to the police departme nt, and to the justice departme nt. And we had some  

secret agents there. They picked up the most im
portant and we took it all out on a big truck, four 
days before the -- Ei senhower said it™s over. So
 it -- it meant quite a lot when we -- we had the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
92 
 
name s, all the Gestapos, we had the name s of th
e -- ma ny of t he traitors, otherwise, they had 
been burned. So they are still the archives. 
Q: Are they in the resistan
ce museum, or are they -- 
A: No, they are taken over by the National Archives
. We have some very specially deep in the -- 
in the cellars. 

Q: Now, on May eighth, y-you are ma de a captain. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Of what?  In the army, or -- 

A: Yes, yes -- 

Q: Yes? 

A: -- because our outfit, the Linge company, th
e special -- as I said, the -- the independent 
company, number one, and then the -- I talked to my 
friend in the -- that washead of the -- all the 
Milorg groups all over the country, 40,000. And I sa
id to him, ﬁ What shall I -- what am I now? ﬂ  
You know, in England, they had the record, they
 didn™t know of Sonsteby. They didn™t know any 
Sonsteby had been in the company. 
They couldn™t do anything to him, they couldn™t give him a 
rank, you cannot give a fa lse name  the rank. So
 Erling Fjeld didn™t get the rank. So -- 
Q: Sorensen didn™t get a rank. 

A: No, sor -- 

Q: Nordstrom didn™t get -- 

A: That™s right. So then the -- Haugland said 
okay [indecipherable] my fri e nd, the leader. Said, 
well I think you™re -- you™re a cap
tain. And then the -- afterwards 
the military off -- authorities, 
they had to fi nd out what -- this Sonsteby has ne
ver been here in England, never been in this 
company. So -- but, of course that was -- the resu
lt was that I was given 
that rank, but it had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
93 
 
come  six mo nths later, because they had to find my
 name, they had to do it all properly. So I kept 
the title. 
Q: So tell me , there 
are 40,000 me n in Milorg? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And so -- 

A: Not -- not in uniforms -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but they had all on [ind
ecipherable] and when the Germans should give up, even in 
Norway, they said, we cannot surrender here, 
we cannot surrender our weapons. It™s no allied 
[indecipherable] here, not one. Then they got th
e me ssage from Eisenhower
 personally, directly. 
You can rest assured, you will meet 40,000 young me n, they have no uniforms, but they have an 

[indecipherable]. And then the German general sai
d, what™s -- why [indeciphe
rable] like this, we 
cannot give away our weapons to this. Then 
Eisenhower sent a new me ssage. They are all 
disciplined, I can guarantee it, they have all 
weapons, they are very disciplined. And then 
general, in the -- at the Lilleha mme r  inNorway said okay, we  -- then 300,000 Germa ns 

surrendered to 40,000 [indecipherable] 
all their weapons, artillery, ev
erything. So they had their -
- it was necessary. They were -- as we say in Norw
ay, they were en -- on ort en stellar, as they 
say in German, they were in th
e right place at the right time.  
Q: And wha t  about the other re
sistance groups, the Communists? 
A: We ll, of course -- 

Q: Or the -- 

A: -- some of them went to the Milorg. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
94 
 
A: So -- so they had some sort, but it was very 
few, so they did -- I must say they did a very good 
job at trying to hurt the armi es when they were
 there. And -- but it was at this time, the whole 
leadership in the home front, I said, after four 
days, when the governme nt delegation is here, you 
take over. We withdraw. And they all wit
hdrew. No trouble whatsoever in Norway, the 

governme nt came and took over all the -- 

Q: And took over? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Intere sting. 

A: They had never any trouble, no -- neve
r any groups that didn™t follow orders. 
Q: Now, you guarded the crown prince when he
 came back on May -- in May -- June -- no, it™s 
May. 

A: Yeah, in -- in June, yeah, that™s correct. 

Q: Both -- both the crown prince, and the king when he came back later? 
A: Yeah, it™s a -- first the crown 
prince came back in 13 May in ™45, because he came  back with 
the governme nt delegation. 
Q: Right. 

A: Half the governme nt, because that had to take 
over as soon as possibl e, we wanted that. And 
then they -- it was 10,000 Germans i n Oslo, and 
the crown prince come  -- came in there, and I 

was asked to -- was responsible for his life. So 
then I put the whole group
, this detachme nt, or 
gang, they were his bodyguard, all of us. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We  were about 20 of bodyguard, all the way -- 
when the royal family came back, they had the 
same . So we were about 20 people having that job. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
95 
 
Q: And you were in the car
, I believe, am I right? 
A: Yes, first of all, when the Crown Prin
ce came , we had another 
friend called Max Manus, 
which I thought was a little quicker than me , be
c ause I could be maybe -- he -- he was like a -- 
like a good horse, he was -- so I thought that -- 
we  were so afraid there we re hand grenade 
landing in the car, because the 
Germans were all around, so -- 
Q: And the crown prince wanted to come  back in 
an open car, right, he didn™t want to have the 
closed car. 

A: Yes, yeah, and I had the discussion with him, but he -- just did -- didn™t -- only wanted an 

open car, but he sat on the top ther
e, on the -- so he just didn™t car
e, but the fellow I had -- th-the 
chauffeur and Max Manus [indecipherable] they 
were both there, and the boys around him, so 
we knew we  could stop it, hope so.  

Q: I understand that when Quisling, who was 
prime mi nister, yes?  
Or a minister under 
Terboven?  
A: Yeah. An-anyway, called 
himself prime mi nister. 
Q: Yeah. But he didn™t have very much power. 
A: No, it was nothing. 

Q: It wasn™t a -- 

A: And the Germans, they -- some -- when -- I think some of them laughed. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- but when you knew Hitler, you had to 
be careful to laugh about some body. So they 
were very -- for instance, Terboven, that [indecipher
able] he was very careful, because that™s -- 

Hitler like him. That had been the whole thing. If
 Hitler liked him, Terboven would be kicked 
out instead. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
96 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So it was very important to be frie
nd of Hitler, I think, at that time .  
Q: I understand that you took him -- accompanied him to his trial, right? 

A: Yes, when he was t-tried, he was sitting in 
one prison, and it was a little too far to the place 
where we should -- he should be tr
ied, courthouse. So I fetched him. And in a way I -- he was 
alone. I-I thought, how terrible, poo
r ma n. In a way. But of course, we knew what he had done 
and all that, he had been terrible, all the things. 
So I had a Black Maria you called that, and I put 

him in there, and -- and then I 
said to a friend of mi ne who ha
d been in all the prison camps, 
three of the worst, and he had survived, and I sa
id to him, Mr. [indecipherable] you sit in with 
Quisling. Tell him what you have experienced. But he
 said afterwards, wasn
™t very -- very ma ny 
words talked between us, he said. So I thought it
 was a very good thing that now he was there. 
Q: Interesting, yeah. 

A: But it -- one thing, I have neve
r seen any soldier, Norwegian re
sistance spitting or even show 
anything in front of the Germans, ne ver. So, a
nd of course Quisling wa
s a little different, but 
nobody came near to him, of course. They couldn™t -- 

Q: So there were no revenge attacks? 

A: No, no, not at all. Of course, we were af
raid. Some people are -- 
can be crazy, you know. 
Q: Yes. 

A: But it was nothing, and we kept an eye all the tim
e, so he should have a trial, a fair tria -- 
well, as fair as possible, whic
h we think we gave him. They 
-- he had his lawyers. But you know, 
when a ma n is trying to overthrow your governme
nt, if you got in a situation like here, that you 
had a ma n trying to overthrow the governme nt here
. You had to shoot him, you had to get rid of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
97 
 
him. And death penalty is the only thing. When 
a man is taking a whole 
country, bei
ng a traitor 
with the whole country, the
n, at that time at least, 
it was no discussion at all. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Pretty much. 

Q: So he was sentenced to death? 

A: He was shot 24
th
 of October ™45, after three,
 four months of trial.  
Q: Did he say anything 
that was signif -- 
A: Oh yes, he tried all the time, he didn™t understand. 

Q: He didn™t understand. 

A: He pretended ma ybe. He pretended, I guess.
 H- He must ha ve understood, but he was a 
strange fellow. 

Q: And you me t Gestapo -- the head of Gestapo, February. 

A: Yes. 
Q: And did you want to meet with him?  
A: We ll, actually, not so 
much, but when I saw he was there, I 
just said hello to him.  But I had 
no -- nothing to tell him. 

Q: Does he -- 

A: I -- I™ve nothing to speak with 
-- I couldn™t -- what shall I talk
 to him about?  So -- so just a 
few words, said to my o-old opponent. But he had b
een -- he -- he really organized the torture in 
Oslo from the very beginning. And I knew he ha
d, for instance, tortured wo me n. He did it in a 
way that put them in a cold room, and then they
 were naked, and they we
re put in cold water, 
and they were just -- tried to put 
them under water, almost til they died more or less, that was the 
terror, real. So he had been a te
rrible fellow. All the people that 
I™d been torturi
ng, the -- all the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
98 
 
tortur ists, were shot in Norwa
y. There was about -- people that 
-- they enjoyed it. These people 
had the death penalty. But when be -- when the 
war was over, I turned around with the Germans, 
the war was over, no mo re war. So I went to
 Germany already 1950, started discussing paper 
buyings from our paper mill in Norway. So we 
had forgotten -- we had not forgotten, but we 
knew we had to change, and saw -- I saw Germ
any built up as a democracy again, through those 
years. I was in Germany from 1950 to 1970, one, at
 least a month. Every month I was there. I 
saw the whole democracy being built up, and I knew
 Willie Br andt, the chancellor, later. And I 
think, luckily, it was -- succeeded, in my opinion, hundred percent. 
Q: H-How do you explain your ability to -- the war 
is over, it™s over, and now we start anew. Is 
this --  

A: Well, it™s natural, isn™t it? 

Q: I don™t know. A lot of people don™t do that. 

A: Yes. Well, it™s rational, let™s put it that 
way. You had to be rational, you have to be 
[indecipherable] no way -- no way. And they were 
enemies, and no more because they done their 
best to become  -- but we have people in Norw
ay, they try -- why don™t you take it into the 
[indecipherable] can say that?  A
nd then we said, okay, if you real
ize that you™ve done a mi stake, 
that you did a mi stake when you joined the -- the N
azi ideas, or the Nazis,
 Holocaust and all that. 
If you don™t say that, that you -- you -- you were 
wrong, we still -- you are still my enemy. I™ll 
never understand that. You have to regret it. 
Wh en the -- you regret it, and you have your 
punishme nt, okay. But we have some  people, they w
ill never regret it, they still think they were 
right. And that™s incredible, isn™
t it?  That™s what™s strange, in
 my opinion. They have a few in 
Norway also, but we were very few in -- 
I think all in Europe, I think. Very few. 
Q: When did you find out about the gas chambe
rs and the genocide, and the ma ss killings? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
99 
 
A: Well, immediately, when -- it was like [indeciphe
rable] the troops, right?  
It was really, really 
real, you know. American troops, th
ey just didn™t believe it. Russian troops, French. And so the 
real thing we  -- we had, of course
, in the last part it was a -- wh
en -- what -- it took a long time til 
we heard that -- what ha ppened to the Norwegia
n Jews. [indecipherable] not before the war was 
over, really, that you had 
the -- the truth of it.  
Q: So did that ma ke you more angry, that -- th
at ma ke you ha te?  It™s -- 
I have a sense that you 
don™t hate. 
A: No, it -- no way. [indecipherable] he
lp at all, and I talked to my
 friend, very close friend that™s 
here with me , Jule Benkel, he was -- was -- as I 
said, in the resistance and later on he became a -- 

th-the leader -- the speaker 
of the house, and we talk about it. I -- 
I feel that he is -- he lost all his 
fa mily. It™s hard for him -- it™s hard for me  to go to the Holocaust. But I -- 

Q: To the Holocaust Museum, yeah. 

A: Yeah, here, and then everywhere. In Germ
any. And then my wife has  taken young people 
down to Auschwitz, I think it™s ma ny thousand sc
hoolchildren, she has been with one of the 
groups, and she said, they have changed when I have
 been there. They changed. It™s really hard. 
So when I first came into a remarkable [indecipher
able] here, I -- I had to -- I couldn™t take it, I 
had to stop. I™d been through it ha
lfway, I say, well I™m sorry, but 
I don™t feel that. The same  
with [indecipherable]. And we have been [indeci
pherable] Norwegian authorities, our foreign 
mi nistry, I think it™s a good idea that we go out
 and inform people. Inform the m in Norway, 
inform the m everywhere where we have listeners. Yep. 

Q: We ll, I want to thank you very 
mu ch. Is there -- is there anythi
ng more you would like to add?   

A: No, I don™t think so, what -- 
I think you have covered a littl
e of the sto -- of the story 
[indecipherable] a little bit. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
100 
 
Q: We ll, thank you so much for comi ng t
oday and sharing your story with us. 
A: Well, it™s very nice to listen to me. I like that .  
Q: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Now can you tell us what we™re
 looking at here?  What does this
 represent?  What does -- what 
does this -- 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- what does this represent, all of these? 

A: Yeah, you see up on the left corner, that™s some
 of my different name s, aliases which I had 
during the war. This is part of
 it. I think I had about 25 dif -- 
different. And this, in the mi ddle 
there, that™s my real passport under Gunnar Sonste
by, which of course couldn™t be used after ™42, 
when I was wanted. That™s the one, yeah. 

Q: That™s the one -- yes,
 that™s his real one. 
A: Yeah. And these ot hers are at different times, from 1941 til ™44 - ™45. 

Q: And they™re actually 
different photographs -- 
A: Yes, I -- I -- and I just  -- 
Q: -- I mean different si -- angles, right? 
A: It™s a very strange, but ever
y picture was -- I didn't try it, but
 I went to these small boxes, you 
know, you fi nd in the railroad station, where you l
ook at -- as a criminal anyway, when you are 
photographed. So that was the case. And you see in 
the sign there, that™s the police sign, which 
you had on the back o -- of the jacket
. I think they did that to police 
here, they back -- they had in 
Norway at that time . So I had -- it had a num
ber, a nu -- number, if you go down there, you see 
the police. I had also a secret police 
me mbership. The card shows that. So -- 
Q: That™s the card on the -- 

A: Yeah, that™s -- 

Q: -- that™s being shown. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
102 
 
A: -- now I am a me mbe r  of the secret federal 
police, and -- the Norweg
ian one. There were -- I 
was a spy, so I could use that in case I was in 
trouble. Very few times we
 -- I -- it usually could 
be used and help me . This is an ordinary police 
-- and this -- this is br i --  dr iver™s license, the 
fuehrer court, fuehrer court. That™s the driver™s
 license, I had the ma de 
up driver™s license like 
the name  I had, so I also changed the driver™s lice
nse, all of them, and then it™s ma ybe a little one 
of the -- the last I had, I had 
it renewe d in 1945, so I never -- I 
shouldn™t tell that to the police 
because I never had an exam. And here, you see,that™s the one there, if you go back a little, 
that™s Erling Fjeld as a soldier in Great Britai
n. So it shows, you could give him any rank, Erling 
Fjeld, he was a -- he was a fake name , so -- but
 it™s incredible, it™s all original soldiers 
[indecipherable] for duration of war. 

Q: Now that was when you went to Britain in 1943? 

A: Yeah, and then a [indecipherable] yes, where th
ey advised me, the British security police, to 
use a false na me  because of the spy risks in -- because I should go back into Norway. If you go a 
little on the side there, that gr
een card there, then I was -- that card has been through about 50 
Gestapo cont rols be tween Oslo and the border, 
and I had no difficulties. It™s ve ry -- I look 
innocent, and the passport was ideal. You had to 
have that kind of passport when you came  up to 
the border. The border dist
rict had special passports
 with -- which I had. 
Q: Now, there you™re wearing a beret for the first time. 
A: No, it™s -- 

Q: No?  

A: -- it™s actually a cap. 

Q: Oh. 

A: It looks like a beret, but it™s a cap. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
103 
 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: But the -- because of the pictur es. And that™s
 an ordinary pa ssport which I got in Stockholm.  
Q: The red one? 

A: Yeah, that™s a -- a real one under a false name
. That was ma de up by Norwegian authorities in 
Stockholm, and it was used only when I was going 
to England. And it had -- 
this has all stamps 
fr om British authorities. 

Q: And that™s -- that™s not a forged one, that™s for real. 

A: That™s real one, ma de by Norwegian authorit
ies outside Norway, of course, not the inside 
Norway. I could do because I had the garment and 
everything else [indecipherable] Norway, here 
in the war. Here you see some  of the stamps wh
ich I had -- was made for me. And I used them, 
and I had stamps, I have a -- about 50 of them
 [indecipherable] papers, because when you had a 
car, you had to have a license plates, they were 
false, you had to have a control sign on your pay 

-- on your wi ndow, or it said that you -- you coul
d run a car, you could run through the night. 
You had all -- I had all kinds of -- when I came 
into, four o™clock in 
the morning, I had a sign 
showing from the Gestapo cho -- top chief that I 
could do it. So everything was -- and I also had 
to ma ke up a book. So when you were out, I had to 
say -- I had to know what kind of job have 

you had tonight with the control. A
nd I -- I -- I did all that. It was 
-- could be with a car, and all 
that, could be three, four, five [indecipherable] you 
need -- they were all there. It was a -- in my 
opinion, it should have been a litt
le strange that you had a routine,
 you we re -- and there were to 
-- you were too good. [tape break
] -- they put in the -- 
Q: Wa it -- you want to repeat -- 

A: -- the hands from the back. 

Q: Why don™t you repeat 
that about the -- the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
104 
 
A: Handcuffs -- 
Q: -- the handcuffs were used by you in the resistance. 

A: Oh yes, those handcuffs there was used, and I 
handcuffed the hands on the back when I trol -- 
tried to control the guards. So -- but you had to
 be very quick to put the handcuffs on a ma n 
[indecipherable] bigger than you, 
and you had to be very quick. 
Q: And those big keys? 

A: Yeah, that™s the -- for that 
[indecipherable] prison, those keys 
there, it was for the cells. I 
could have got right in there when we tried to 
get out my friend, who was later shot and who we 
tried to give that poison pill. It must be very ha
rd for him, instead of we taking out, he just got a 

pill. Pl ease take it [indecipherabl e]. It was terrible 
to -- for us, too, to do that. But he was terribly 
tortured. Could have helped him.  

Q: And those brass knuckles, whose are those? 

A: Yeah, that -- is th
at a [indecipherable] 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, that could be used if you are a -- 

Q: Did you use those?  Di d you have those? 

A: No, I ha -- I didn™t, but I knew exactly, I wa
s trained how to use it. If you hit a ma n just 
behind the ears you can kill hi m always. They are te
rribly -- they are very -- and if you hit the 
ma n on the nose like that, he wouldn™t talk to 
you for some  hours, I can tell you. So it™s a very 
dangerous thing. For German and Norwegian, I™ll tell you that. 

Q: Okay, go ahead.  

A: Yeah, this is a passport which we used when
 you are nearing the border. When we were about 
25 from the border, 25 miles, then you would have
 a special passport. Every citizen there would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
105 
 
have this kind, so you can -- you are allowed to be 
in that district so near the border. And it was 
necessary to have this. If you haven™t got th
em, you would be arrested when you -- it was a 
restricted area alongside a border. And that™s a pict
ure that I usually -- when you take a picture in 
that box in the station all that
, they™re all different. Look like criminal anyway, don™t you, when 
you have these pictures taken. 

Q: It™s a nice picture. 

A: And it™s in German a nd Norwegian. So you 
can see the German, now you would read the 
German, so the -- the German guard would see imme
diately that you were supposed to be there. 
And you -- you would be arrested co
 -- if you hadn™t a good reason to 
be visiting there, and even 
if you should go 30 miles in Norway, you had to 
have a permission. The written permission. And 
here is that passport of Thor Hansen. Then -- 
this I very seldom used, because you see in the 

signature th-that is from the ge
neral -- Nazi genera
l Martinsen who was the most -- that ™s my 
handwriting, but on the we -- left
 side, you see it™s signed by Martinsen, he was one of the worst 
me n we had in Norway. He was a leader of the 
-- all these st ate police,
 all the federal Nazi 
police, and I used to -- I know his handwriting so 
well now, so I can -- if you want me to sign it, 
I ma y be able to sign it even today. 

Q: So when would you use that? 

A: I would use it in -- for instance when I had to go
 to a special district in
 Norway with a -- to try 
-- if it was a real hurry, to get to
 tol --  tell people, give them some
 idea, then I could use this. And 
in the car, I had a car, it was the same state polic
e car, federal -- could be a Chevrolet, could be a 
Chrysler that  I -- that  I had, a
nd that -- I had a driver™s license 
with the same  na me , Thor Hansen, 
and that -- on the -- I -- plate ther
e, it said -- the state police, fede
ral police. So it could be three, 
four documents which you had to have in orde
r to go through that control, Gestapo control. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
106 
 
Q: And you didn™t have to wear a unifor m in that situation? 
A: No, no, it™s all civilian. 

Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh. 

A: We ™re all civilians. All Gestapo, they were ordi
nary civilians. Very seldom they show that 
they were all S -- SS, they had high ranks, but they we
re -- to do that job, they 
had to be all, as in 
Germany, they were all civilian clothes. So I ha
d -- I didn't need the -- and that™s an ordinary 
passport, which every Norwegian had to have, 
with the number and everything. Luckily, if you 

see the number on top there, if they had stopped 
me , and had the lightest suspicion that I was 
lying, then they would call th
at number, that was that.  
Q: Mm. 

A: And I was finished. So -- but I never -- they 
never did, luckily. But if they did so, you would 

be taken imme diately. Then you ar
e -- then you would be killed. 
Q: But this is when you were Erling? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Af -- 

A: Yeah, that™s Erling Jacobsen, is it? 

Q: No. 

A: Erling -- oh this is Brul, th
at™s my -- bull. Chicago Bulls. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: No, this is Erling -- Er ling Johannes Brul -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- you see, on the top there. 

Q: I see, so it™s anot her -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
107 
 
A: That™s the fa mily name  on the top. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And down to 16 years you had to have these passports, everybody. 

Q: Okay. 

A: When you had that passport and you -- no, when
 you had that passport, on the left side you 
had a J printed when you were a Jew. And that came
 in, I think it was in ™
41 - ™42, it was terrible, 
of course, when we saw that in Norway. We  had ne
ver thought of it, that 
he was -- was he -- that 
[indecipherable] was he we didn™t ever think abou
t it, so we thought it wa
s awful, all Norway.  
Q: I have a question to ask you. 
Do you dream about this now? 
A: Not at all. When I leave here, I put the dr awer
 inside again. Now, I ha
ve taken the drawer out, 
when I leave this room, I put it in again. 

Q: Do you think about it? 

A: No, not at all. 
Q: Not at all? 
A: No. But I have to think about it tomorrow, because then I -- 

Q: You have to speak, yes. 

A: -- meet my friend, and we have to talk a
bout it. Then you have to
 put it in again. 
Q: So how -- when you -- 

A: No, I am lucky there. I am just [indecipherable] 

Q: We ll when you look -- 

A: -- tonight -- 

Q: Yes 

A: [indecipherable
] think about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0406  
108 
 
Q: It™ll -- it™ll be gone. 
A: Oh yes. Why shouldn™t it? 

Q: So when you think about your life -- 

A: It™s in here -- it™s in -- tim
e now, I don™t need to think that way. 

Q: But when you think back -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: -- at that time, are you amazed at what you did, or 
it™s just well, this is 
what I did?  I mean -- 
A: No. 

Q: You™re not amazed? 

A: No. It was so long ago, you know
, so -- no, don™t think about it. 
Q: And do you see yourself as a hero? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: Do you see yourself as a hero? 
A: Not yet. 
Q: Not yet.  

A: No, no, not at all. We ll, we were ma ny, you k
now. And some of the small people here, which 
helped us, could be the hero, for inst ance, any of them, gave us the ri ght intelligence. And if we 

were taken and you know, I could get away becaus
e I was quite clever, you know, and the others, 
they [indecipherable]. So they, the helpers were us
ually the heroes. That™s quite clear. Oh, that™s 

quite clear.  

Q: Well, I think you™re a her
o. You don™t have to. Thank you. 

A: You have the rest of them?
