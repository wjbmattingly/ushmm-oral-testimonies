Abstract 
 
Bozenna Gilbride, née Urbonowicz, 
was born to Christian farming 
parents, Wi ctor and Janina 
(Janka), in Wolyn, near Tuczyn, Poland. Her father hi
d Jews in a shed on his farm early in World 
War II, and was arrested often. In late summer 
1943, they barely escaped when their fa rm and 
village were burned to the gr
ound by Ukrainians who ﬁbutcheredﬂ the villagers. Her fa mily 
immi grated to Germany, unaware of what wa
s happening there, Bozenna says. At Freiburg 
(Freiburg im Breisgau), Germa
ny, eight-year-old Bozenna and herfamily worked in a factory 
ma king leather goods for German soldiers. An a
unt gave birth to a baby. Germans dr ained its 
blood for German troops, and the baby died.  
 

The fa mily was moved to a slave labor camp in Che mnitz, where her parents worked in a 

munitions factory. Bozenna contracted TB, and fr
iends saved her from receiving a lethal shot by 
switching her me dical papers. Her mother was su
spected of being in the Polish underground, so 
German troops beat her and sent her to Ravens
bruck, where she was sterilized. Her mo ther was 
sent eventually to Gross-Rosen. 

 

Bozenna says the worst part of all her experi
ence was being separated from her mothe r . The 
father and the four children rema
ined together throughout the war. 
 

When the American front approached their camp, the Germans took the 
several hundred inma tes 
to the nearest city, and du mped them on the sidewalk. They walked for days. Germans gave them 

food they begged for, but would not allo
w them to sleep on their property.   
 
Eventually, the fa mily was in a DP camp in 
Leipzig from 1945 until the beginning of 1947, when 
they immi grated to the United Stat es. 
Bozenna was 12 and a half years old.  
 
After the war, the mother return
ed to Poland. She wrote to relatives in US, who said her family 
was in New York City. Denied a visa, the 
mother joined the Polish underground, and was 
imprisoned. Eventually freed, and finally granted 
a visa, she joined the family in NYC in 1957. 
 
  

Tape 1 Side A 
 
My father was a farmer. I think he was self-e
ducated; he had schooling. He  was in the Polish 
Ar my (AK), as were my uncles.  My mother cam
e from a farming fa mily too. She came from a 
large family, as did my father.  My mother™s 
family seemed to be very musically inclined. 
Everybody took to an instrume nt. Nobody sang, though. 
Grandmother, my father™s mother, left 
for America, I think, in 1938, and stayed in Amer i
ca. She never returned.  And my father, the last 
son to ma rry, took over the farm and ran it for profit. 
 
And your mother, she helped? 
 
She worked side by side . There™s even a story th
at she had a baby in the field, wrapped it up and 
returned to work.  I don™t know if it™s
 just as accurate as they tell it. 
 
But you we ren™t that  baby? 
 
I wasn™t that baby, no. It was later on. 

 
What was religious life in your family? 
 
As far as school goes, I reme mber being taught re
ligion in our local school, we observed all holy 

days. Church, we had to walk. Some times we 
would use the wagon and go 
to church in Tuczyn. 
In Tuczyn, my father had a wonderful friend, Mr
. Friedman.  The reason they were such good 
friends is they dealt in the ma rket together, se
lling vegetables and farm goods.  I reme mber one 
time Friedman sent me  a pair of white galoshes.  
I had never seen white galoshes in my life.  I 
didn™t know what they were for.  You put 
them over the shoes.  I didn™t know that. 
 
And what did you do with them? 
 
I just wore them and flopped around in the galosh
es in the house. I thoug
ht, gee what wonderful 
floppy shoes, you know, and they were white
. I™d never seen white shoes before. 

 
What was t he house like? I imagine it would be a farmstead? 
 
Yes, we had three rooms , a very large liv
ing room, with ma ny windows, kitchen, and one 
bedroom.  I reme mber sleeping sometimes in 
the living room because it was warmer by the 

stove.  In Poland, they had stoves that you woul
d warm up i n the kitchen, and the wall behind, 
some ti me s three walls from the other sides would keep the other rooms warm, so it depended, I 

guess what the situation was, how many 
of us were in the same  room.   
 

And I, being the oldest of four children, I was al
ready responsible to go ou
t with the cows into 
the meadow and stay there all day, which I didn™
t like, I didn™t like gett
ing up so early in the 
morning. It was barely daybreak, and I heard my 
father or mother calling me . Oh, how I hated 
that part.  I didn™t want to come
 out of bed, but I did. I would go out
 to the fields, and I would cry 
almost the whole day that I had to go. 

 

So walking the cows out -- was that your primary job?
 
 
That was my primary thing, and I had to learn 
horseback riding, bareback. That was very hard 
because the horse that  was mi ne, Mischka, (Mys
zka? ) which means a ﬁlittle mouseﬂ, Mischka 
was very frisky and every time Mischka wouldbend down her head to graze, I would slide 

down. And I would cry, why would 
she do that to me, why didn™t 
she let me sit on top, because 
my father would get furious, ‚Can™t you catch on 
that if you go into the gr
ass, the horse is going 
to bend down and graze and then you™ll slide right down™. 

 
And ho w long did it take for you–?
 
 
I don™t remember, I don™t reme mber if I ever mast
ered, but I know that when we left Poland I 
thought about Mischka a lot.  Th
at was my horse, she was a very smart horse. When I fell down 
one time and she was walking, everyone said that
 she™s going to trample me . But Mischka, I 
don™t know how she did this. I fell down, I was in her path.  She stepped over me .  She  knew that 

I was there, and she just kept 
going, but she stepped over me .  I reme mbe r  my father or mother 
screaming ﬁ™Bozenna, Bozenna, Bozenna™ﬂ.   I was in
 the path of that horse.  But Mischka didn™t 
hurt, she just stepped over me . 

 
Now, you r ode Myszka not as sport, this was not sport, this was–?
 
 
Sport, no this was for sport. I was learning, I 
was learning, but eventually I would have to 
ma ster.  Everybody had to learn these things.  
Skiing was something, was some thing you had to 
learn.  There wasn™t muc h to do on a far m. 

 
It was dull?
 
 
We didn™t know it was dull, no. It wasn™t what our children have now. 

 
Did you have electricity? 
 
No.  I reme mber a wireless radio though.  And wh
en we left Poland, when we ran, I reme mber 
running and thinking, oh, my gosh, we left that wi
reless behind. I thought that was ma gic, my 
radio.  It was forbidden to listen to, forbidden.  
 
Under the Germans or  under the Russians?
 
 
Communists, Communists, yes.  We
 kept it in the drawer in ou
r bedroom, covered with cloth.  
And the only time they listened to the wireless wa
s if you invited a neighbor or two.  This way, 
they wouldn™t give you away.  
 
Accomplices? 
 
 

Right, right.  But I remember my father talki
ng about Hitler.  I had no idea who Hitler was. 
 
What did your father say about Hitler?
 

 
I reme mber him saying, ﬁ‚Oh my God, what is 
he doing now.™ﬂ  That™s 
about all I remember, 
ﬁ‚Look what he™s doing now,™ﬂ in shock, you know, 
ﬁ‚Look what he™s doing now.™ﬂ  But I never 
knew what he was doing. 

 
You didn™t even know he was a Ge rman or
 a Nazi  or anything of that sort? 
 
I had no idea.  Even in school at Christma s time 
when the Communist authorities would come  to 
inspect the schools, our teachers would suddenly 
speak Russian.  We  were told that when 
authorities would come , that
 they will ask you, "‚And who gives you candy?™"  We  were 
supposed to shout, ‚Papa Stalin gives us candy!™ 
 And then they would throw candy at us, which 
they did. They would throw handfuls and handfuls of wrapped candy at us, and we would squeal 
with delight.  We  had no idea who Stalin was.  
We had no television, no regular papers, wireless 
was forbidden, how would you know
 anything, especially childre
n?   Nothing, children were 
protected all the time .  You tell ch
ildren nothing, that™s the best way. 
 
Did your parents ever talk about these things
 to you? Did they coach you in any way? 
 
My only coaching came, there was one warm summer
, my mother sent me  to the River Bug [ph 
78], which was in our front yard almost.  We  ha
d a shed there, and my mother™s instructions 

were to take the bread and soup to these people 
and give it to them.  But  if you are stopped on 
the road, turn around, speak to no one, and come  
right back home .  And I did this repeatedly, 
over and over, but I never saw people in the shed, 
just hands.  I didn™t know if they were me n or 
wome n or children.  There was no 
way of knowing.  And this would go on, and then they would 
stop, these visits to the shed.  And then later, th
ey would resume  again.  
And my father, atthat 
time, he was arrested frequently. 
 
This wo uld have been under the Russians?
 
 
Still under Co mmunis m, yes.  And I didn™t know 
why, I thought this had some thing to do with 
him being in the military. At this point my aunt, the wife of the Polish offi cer, moved in with us 

one night. In the mi ddle of the night she came, 
and it was all very hush-hush, whispers. She was 

pregnant then, and had three little boys.  But 
my uncle, her husband, was nowhere in sight that 

night.  She didn™t stay long with 
us.  The Communists came  in 
the mi ddle of the night, grabbed 
her, the three little children, and 
they were shipped to Siberia. 
 At that time, we didn™t know 
where they took them.  But after the war, we had 
the full story.  She lost the little baby girl in 
Siberia. 
 
Do you know when this happened?
 
 

My recollection is, it was less than a year before
 we left Poland, less.  We left Poland in 1943, 
and it was before that, but not long. 
 It wasn™t long before that. 
 
But under the Russians? 
 

Oh, yes, yes.  Now I know that those people that
 my father was giving 
the shed to, and hiding 
them, they were friends of friends, Jewish friends.  I found out, when I got to America after the 
war, that that™s who these people were, I never knew who these people were, they were just 

people.  The children were protected, don™t tell 
the children too much. 
 Tell them nothing, it™s 
even better.  So we never knew. 

 
Under the Russian occupation in 
1939, did your father lose his farm?
 
 
No, it became a collective farm. I reme mber that
 you couldn™t kill a pig.  I reme mber that my 
father and neighbors di d kill a pig together, sl
aughtered it and divided it.  You couldn™t do it 
alone because you were afraid some body would sn
itch, but of course, if you got your neighbors 
in on it, you could get away with it.  Also, we
 had a bee farm, and a portion of the bees, the 
honey, had to be given back to the Communists.
  They would send some one who would collect 
the honey, and they would leave us a small portion. 
 
Did this bee farm prec ede the time of the S
oviet occupation? I mean was this something 
that –? 

 
It was already there, but that wasn™t our bee fa
rm. It was rented by some
body else. He used our 
land for that.  We  also had nuts. We  grew nuts, 
too. That too, a portion had to be given to the 
Communists. 
 
What else di d your parents grow on the farm? 
 
Potatoes, wheat, those were the primary. Wh
eat and potatoes were the primary things. 
 
Do you remember the outbreak of war in Sept ember 1939?
 
 
No, no. Whe n parents listened to 
the wireless, they usually ma de
 sure you weren™t there.  The 
children didn™t hear it or know that they™re 
listeni ng because you were afraid.  Children go to 
school; children talk on 
the streets, children tell each othe
r.  You didn™t let the children know 
these things. It was safer that way.  That™s 
why, to me , that wireless was a ma gic box. I didn™t 
know how you can get a voice out of that. 

 
You described going to school. You began going
 to school  under the Soviets in the fall of  
1939.  Besides telling you where your candy was 
coming from, what else did they teach 
you? 
 
 I don™t remember anything else. I reme mber portra
its of Stalin being in the classrooms, that I 
reme mber.  Oh, yes, I reme mber when the Comm
unists would come  into town, and they would 
be walking in the road in front of our house.
  We  were given orders, I don™t know by whom, 
though.  We  had little red flags, and you had to put them every so often on the fence to welcome, 
the red flags were to welcome the Communists 
who visit the town, that I reme mber. And I 
reme mber my father saying some thing like, ‚Are 
they gone? ™   And he™d run out and pick up all 
the red flags, and hide them for the next time
 that we™re told to put out the red flags. 
 

Did you see Soviet Army troops?
 
 
Marching, mm-hmm, in fr
ont of our house, yup. 
 
And ho w did they behave?
 
 
As if they were our saviors.  As if they were 
Œ I never saw any -- they ne
ver terrorized us.  There 
was nothing like that.  They rode th
eir horses, with their chins high. 
 I was terrified of their boots 
and shoes because they were shiny.  I never sa
w shiny shoes on a farm. We never saw shined 
shoes. 

 
Muddy wo uld be the word.
  
 
Muddy, yeah.  To this day, I still have a fear of
 boots, high shiny boots like policeme n wear.  I™m 
not alone, I know a lot of other survivors 
that are scared of high, shiny boots. 
 
For the sound that they make.
 
 
Click, click, yes. 

 
How was your mother taking these changes? 
 We talked a little bi t about your father. 
 
 
You mean at that time, what was happening? 

 
Yes, in 1938, 1939, 1940? 
 
My mother, I don™t remember her doing anything 
but working, working, working right alongside 
of my father.  And then, of c
ourse, family ma tters. She was a very family oriented woma n.  We 
did have hired help.  Wh en a new baby would be
 born, my mother would get a lovely Ukrainian 
girl that was very friendly to us
.  She would come, take care of the baby so that my mother could 
work the fi elds with my father.  And then sh
e would disappear until the next  baby™s born.  And 
then the same girl would come  back, and she was 
very nice to us. She was a very gentle lady, a 
young girl, she wasn™t a woma n yet, she was a girl. Bu
t she wa s older then the rest of us, so to us 
she seemed like a lady. But I don™t reme mber a ch
ildhood really on the farm.  I worke d from the 
day I was born.  I always felt like I wa s a mother
, always, I don™t reme mbe r  anything else. I was 
always taking care of some body.  I a l ways had to be very grown up. 

 
So you were kind of a baby sitter since your mo
ther was working on the farm much of the 
time?
 
 
Yeah. 

 
Would you call your mother strict?
 
 
Never, no, no.  My father, yes.  There™s a Polish 
expression that the ma n is the king of the house, 

but the woman is the crown, so she is above him.  

 
So she is above him
. 
 

In a very nice way, right? 

 
Uhm, did you have any pets other than your famous horse?
 
 
Yes, yes, we had dogs.  As a ma tter of fact, 
when we ran from our far m, the dog had puppies. 
Oh, and I was so upset, what will become , because
 the whole village was burned.  That  means if 
she wasn™t smart enough to drag those puppies
 from under the shed, they would perish. 

 
When was your village burned? 
 
Late summe r  of 1943.  We had horses, cows, lots 
of cows, pigs, sheep. It was a regular farm.  
Now, from what I understand from r e latives, our 
far m was a very thriving far m. My father was 
very knowledgeable about farming, and he really 
was very devoted to his land.  That land in 
Wolyn, the soil is ve ry black, it is a ve ry rich soil , it™s a farme r s dream to till such soil.  And my 
father recognized that even the
n, that that is good, ri
ch soil. We can live on land like that, and we 
did.  We  were not wealthy, but we were never hungr
y, ever.  There was always some fruit, there 
were some  nuts, there was honey. There was all ki
nds of ways of fixing potatoes.  There were 

leftover scraps of meat.  My mother would 
dream up these concoctions, and we thought it was 
heaven.  

 
So as far as you knew you were not missing out on anything? 
 
Nothing, we were fine. 
 
Were you old enough to have dreams, that is, 
dreams of what you would do wh en you grew 
up? 
 
No, I never had dreams like that. 

 
When is the first time you saw Germans? 
 
Well, when we run from our village, from our
 farm, in 1943.  The village was burned to the 
ground and butchered by the Ukrainians, who want
ed, from what I understand now, the land that 
we were on.  We  were the mi nority in Wolyn. 
 All summer long, we would sleep out on the 
fields, because we knew they were determined to
 kill us and burn the village.  But this one 
summer night, we decided to sleep in our beds
, and that™s the night 
that it happened.   
 

Our neighbor came to our window and quickly ra
pped on our bedroom wi ndow, waking us all.  
He said, ‚Wictor, Wi ctor, they are burning our villag
e, this is the night.™  
We just jumped out of 
the bed.  There was no time to find clothes.  In
 the dark, you couldn™t put
 lights on, you couldn™t 
light a candle or anything.  We  ran out the doo
r, and we could alrea
dy look back and see the 
village burning.  You could hear 
the crackle, the homes collapsing 
already in the fire.  We  ran 
through the wheat, through the forest
, heading for Grandma™s house.   

 
We thought that from that end of the village, ma ybe we could get to Grandma and Grandpa and 

everyone there, and warn them and run together. 
But it wasn™t like that.  By the time we reached 
Grandma, that end of the village started to burn to
o.  So we headed in another direction.   While 
we were running, my father had th
e bright idea that he™d like to 
go back to the farm, a nd let all 
the animals out of the barns because  he had visi on
s that we™d return to the land again.  So we 
didn™t know if he was safe, because he  ran back.  
He told us to keep running towards the river.  
Then, as we were running towards the river a
nd realized he™s not be
hind us, we didn™t know Œ 
continue or wait for him, what
?   My mother said, "‚Keep 
running, don™t stop.™"  So we ™re 
running and running and running, an
d behind us there™s a ma n following us.  And my mother 

grabbed the youngest child who was almost three, 
and she told us, ‚Hold on to each ot her, don™t 
let go, and run as fast as you can™.  As we 
were running, the ma n behind us is calling my 
mother™s name  ‚Janka, Janka, Janka–™  My mo
t her is so frightened, because ma ny pe ople knew 
us in the village, not just Poles,
 but Ukrainians knew us to.   
 

Well, we were running as fast as
 we could, and it was my fat her. 
 He caught up to us, but in the 
dark, in the moonlit night, you couldn™t tell.  Even
tually, we reached the ri
ver, and we went to 
the forest near the river, and 
we spent the rest of the night hoping Grandma was okay.  We  were 
very close to her house.  Morningcame .  We all decided that we ha
ve to move on.  We can™t stay 
here, it™s daylight, because 
they™ll come  looking for us. 
 
The Ukrainians? 
 
Yes, they™ll come  looking for us to finish us off.  
So we crossed the river, and in the river, as we 
were crossi ng, there was a teenage girl from 
the village, with a dog, a big German shepherd.  

And that dog barked and barked and barked.  And 
she was still in the wate
r, and she was begging 
us, "‚Please, please Mr. Urbonowicz,
 please take me  with you.™" And 
there were lots of people. 
We weren™t alone.  There were ma ny other villag
ers with fa milies.  They
 had a conference, all 
the grown-ups there at the river, 
and they decided not to take he
r along.  They asked her to leave 
the dog because he™ll give us away 
with that barking.  She wouldn™t.
  She chose to stay with the 
dog. And we continued, and we cros
sed the river into the clearing. 
 
This was the Bug [ph245] River? 
 
Bug  [ph245] River, yeah.  And whe n we crosse
d the river, heading for my aunt™s house, we 
stood up.  And the field was open, no trees.   The s
hots started to ring out.  The Ukrainians or 
some one wa s waiting for us to stand up and show 
ourselves.  So we all hit the dirt, and we 
crossed on all fours into the next pa
tch of woods into the forest.   
 

There, we went to my aunt Leocadia™s house.
  The house was empty, no one was there. We  got 
frightened, we started to walk aw
ay.  Near her house was a pond, it wa
s mud at this point.  As we 
were walking out of her house by the pond, bodi
es stood up covered with mud. My God, we 

thought, this is it for us, all of us
. We ™re finished now.  That was 
my aunt and my unc le and their 
children. They were hiding in th
e pond.  When we knew they we
re okay, we went to another 
aunt™s house across the road to see if she™s okay.   

 

There, the chicken and geese were running ove
r the house. The front gate was swinging. But 
they had children our age, so
 my mother thought she could ge
t clothes for us and dresses, 
because we were only in our nightshirts and baref
oot. My mother dressed us, and my father said 
he was going back to the farm to see. My father
 loved his land. He had to 
go back to see if it™s 
okay for us to return. And he was gone a long tim
e. My mother got nervous. She decides to go 
find him. She leaves us lying on 
the cot there, and she goes.   
 

She told us that when she got to the farm, 
there was nothing standing. 
She didn™t see Wictor 
either. She didn™t know what to do. She knew we 
were hungry, so she grabbed a chicken by the 
head, and decided she™s going to take the chicken 
back to us, and we™ll have dinner. As she™s 
running with this chicken, holding the chicken by 
its neck, there™s a ma n running after her. She 
got so scared, she dropped the chicken and ran 
fa st. But it was my father. He recognized her 
again. 

 
Two cases of mist ak en identity in one week. 
 
This is fright, this is fright you know.  By th
en, my mother found some  c l othes for us, and we 
started to go deeper into Poland.  We  walked 
into Tuczyn that was where Mr. Friedman lived.  
We stopped at Friedman™s. We  did that often at 
Friedman™s house, because he lived close to our 
church. So we often stopped and shook the sand 
from our shoes and continued to our church, 
which was just a stone™s throw away from hi m.   

 

In Friedman™s house, we were told to lie down 
and rest. Mr. and Mrs. Friedman took my mother 
and father to the kitchen, but they didn™t close 
the door. And I being the oldest, and I wa sn™t that 
tired, I heard what they were saying.  And my 
father was pleading with Mr. Friedman to leave 
the town and run. ﬁ™Don™t stay here.ﬂ And Friedman
 said, ﬁ™No, this is my home , this is my land, 
and I am staying.™ﬂ And we left them there in
 that house, standing in the doorway, and bidding 

us farewell. 

 
And Mr. Friedman was  Jewi sh? 
 
He was Jewish. They were friends that 
my father dealt with in the market. 
 
How had he managed to survive two years of German occupation? 
 
No, he did, he did. 
 
Not in hiding? 
 
No, no, no. 

 
The Ukrainians when t hey were burning you
r village, did they discriminate between 
Ukrainian and Polish homes? 
 
We didn™t see a difference.  The whole villag
e was burning. I don™t know. The whole village was 
down to the ground, nothing rema ined. When my  father
 ran back to see if any of our livestock 

was returned to the barns, or anything, nothi
ng was standing.  The bric
k schoolhouse, my father 
said, rema ined standing.  But everything else 
was leveled. Nothing. You wouldn™t recognize one 
house from another that st
ood there. You wouldn™t know. 
 
Would you know where they got their we apons? 
 
No, most of the arms, they we
re knives, that kind Œ most. 
 
So they didn™t have fire arms? 
 
We heard firearms, but I know for a fact that most
 of their arms Œ they were butchering people Œ 
that™s why we use that expression. They were butc
hering because that is exactly what they were 
doing. They would slit your
 throat or stab you. 
 
This was a very primitive operation? 
 
Very primitive, yeah. But when we left Friedman
, we decided to go deeper into Poland.  There 
were throngs of us by then on the road, withnap sacks, pushing baby carriages, homeless people 

like us. 

 
Fleeing the same? 
 
That™s right. 
 
For two years you lived under German occupation? 
 
Soviet, Soviet that part of, that 
part, not German yet, I was still– 
 
So this was still before 1941? 
 
That™s right. Now in 1943, I was still under the Sovi et occupation, that part of – we didn™t see 

anything different. There was no difference there. 
When we left the farm and ran, we ran right 
into the arms  of the Nazis now. 

 
I™m saying that period between 1941 when th
e Nazi s took over your area and then in 1943 
when Soviets are returning, did you
 have any experience that™s–? 
 
No difference.  No, we didn™
t see the difference there. 
 
No difference?
 
 
No!  I didn™t see German soldiers. 

 

 
No German soldiers, no atrocities? 
 

No, nothing. 
 
So the first atrocity that  
you experienced was at the hands of those Ukrainians? 
 
That was first, yes. That was first. 

 
In 1943, and this is what drives you deeper into
 Poland, and when you first run into Nazi s? 
 
That™s right, and there were th
rongs of people with knapsacks, 
and we didn™t know which way to 
go.  And we  ma rched right into the arms of the Nazi
s in Poland.  I didn™t k
now what city or what 
town this was in, but when we arrived, it was getting towards the evening and the Nazis had told 

us that they™ll put us up in this abandoned sc
hool building or some thing, 
or railroad station. It 
was just a building really, a big building. As a ma
tter of fact, we couldn™
t even get inside the 
building, there were too ma ny peopl e. We  woun
d up sleeping on the outside. But the Germans 
told us that the Ukrainians, they frightened us 
really, now I see. They told us that they are 

ﬁ™going to come  back tonight to fini sh you 
off.  We will give  you arms . You can defend 
yourselves.™ﬂ 

 
The Germans are going to help you to defend yourselves? 
 
Against the Ukrainians. This is what they told us
 the adults, yes. They are going to defe nd us.  In 
the morning, they ma de us an offer, the Germans, we couldn™t refuse. They did come  to attack 

us, by the way, all night long. 

 
The Ukrainians? 
 
Oh, yes, oh, yes. There was shooting all night lo
ng, bullets whizzing past our ears, because we 
weren™t inside the building, we couldn™t get in, it
 was too crowded.  In the morning, the Germans 
told us that we can go to Germany, t hat we™ll ha
ve a place to live, we™ll have a job, we ™ll be 
warm, and we™ll have food.  What else could 
we do?   We  couldn™t go back.  We  didn™t know 
what was really happening in Germa ny.   
 

Wagons came very quickly; this was done very, very
 fast.  The cattle cars arrived. I had never 
seen a train in my life.  I thought cattle cars we
re the only way to travel. What did I know?  No 
one ever showed me  any other way.  They rounde
d up the people and they very quickly pushed 
us into the wagons.  There were too ma ny people,
 so we ended up standing shoulder to shoulder. 
In a cattle car, there™s no window
s, just slits on top, elongated 
kinds of slits. And you couldn™t 
breathe when there™re so ma ny people.
 And there were no facilities.   
 

We traveled, I think, two nights 
or two days a night, I don™t re
me mber. I was only about eight 
and a half.  I don™t reme mber food or water being 
given, I™m sure there was some  at  some  point. 
I know that mothers were crying because they ha
d no room. They wanted to nurse their babies; 
they couldn™t.  There was no room.   

 

When we arrived finally in Freiburg, Germa
ny a nd the doors slid open, I knew we left people 
behind, but I didn™t know that they 
were dead.  There were babies, there we re old people. They 

just fell down when we started to file out 
from the wagons.  They probably died standing up, 
because there wasn™t enough room to lie down.  
They quickly put us into an abandoned building 
in Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau), where my 
mot her and father worked in a leather factory, 
ma king things for the Nazi troops.  Children worked 
in a field.  I can™t reme mber what we did in 
that field, though. Did we pick potatoes, plant 
potatoes?  I can™t reme mber  a thing.  I just 
reme mber walking and being very, very col
d, and picking up rock
s from the field. 
 
This wo uld have been late summer, fall? 
 
Late summe r , fall, yes, yes, as soon as we got there.   

 
So it would be harvest time? 
 
We were doing some thing. I know now why I don™t re
member , because I starte
d to get sick with 
TB. And my mother begged one of
 the guards in the factory to 
get some medical attention for 
me . Now, we were still not in 
the normal type of slave labor 
camp. They were just keeping us 
there for factory work.  Later,
 they started to divide us, 
and sending us wherever Germany 
needed slave labor. By the time the German guard
 offered to help me , I was very, very sick 
already. I wa s semi -conscious by then.   
 

He came in a little black car like a Volkswagen, 
and he took me  to a hospital. I reme mber riding 
with him, and I saw a gray building that I thought
 would be a hospital, and I was impressed that 
I™m going to be in that beautiful, beautiful kind of
 a building.  But that was not for people like 
me. That was a German hospital. Far away from that
 hospital, he told me later, that that  was for 
Polish swine. And that™s where they kept people lik
e me .  I reme mber lying 
in that hospital. And 
my mother said years later that she came  to vi
sit me. But I didn™t know re
ally that she snuck out 
from that place some how and got to the hospital.   

 

I reme mber that I was very sick and I thought I wa
s dreaming that my mot her was sitting next to 
me  and stroking my hand and talking sweet
, you know, like mothers 
do. But I thought I was 
dreaming, so I wouldn™t open my eyes. I thought if
 I open my eyes, the dream would stop. So I 
never opened my eyes, and my mo
ther died never knowing that I knew that she was there. But I 
didn™t want to open my e yes.   

 

I was in the hospital, my  mother said, three to 
four months. It was very cold, but it was drawing 
close to spring when another guard came  to bring 
me  back to my mother. But he didn™t come  in a 
car this time , he came on a bicycle. And it wa
s cold, and I was holding on to the handlebars. I 
was sitting on the handlebars, holding on. And I reme mber the road still having patches of snow. 

But it was thaw already, and it was mud, and the 
bicycle was constantly splashing mud all over 
my legs. Wh en we got to the building where th
ey kept us, I couldn™t get my hands off the 
handlebars. I thought they froze to 
the handlebars. He had to help me  get my fingers straightened 
out. My mother begged them, if they™d only let me
 rest a little bit and they said no, I had to go 
back to the field with the other children.   

 

At this point, my hair was already shaved, because
 I was infest ed with lice. All of us were. My 
hair was just growing back. I had to wear a beret. Some body gave 
me  a hat. But when I returned 

from the hospital, I had no shoes. My shoes were
 stolen, so I had to wr
ap rags around my feet. 
We slept with our shoes under our pillows, th
at™s how bad it was. No one had shoes. 
 
What did they feed you? 
 
In this particular camp, t hey had the ugliest s
oup ever. It was soup ma de out of cherries. I hated 
that. It was sweet-sour. I didn™t 
reme mber anything but that soup, 
and there was vegetable that 
they gave us, like turnip. That was an over abund
ance. I don™t reme mber milk. Maybe we did get 
it. I don™t reme mber 
seeing milk there. 
 

How about sleeping conditions
? 
 

Sleeping, we  slept, this building, there were no 
beds. We  slept on a floor. Whatever we brought 
with us, belongings, clothes for a pillow, or if
 you happened to have a blanket, you covered all 
your children with one blanket. That™s why we we
re so lice-infested there, because we  were on 
top of each other. 

 

Was the family allowe d to stay together
? 
 

Yes, at this point, yes. 

 

So there wa s segregation based on gender
? 

 

No, no. 

 

Which kind people were in this camp
?  Were they all from  your town, village
? 
 

No, strangers, strangers at this point. But from wh
at I re me mber, we were  all Poles at this place. 
 

All Poles
? 
 

We all spoke Polish, I don™t reme mber
 hearing any other language there. 
 
No Uk rainians? 
 
No, I didn™t hear it, no. In the end of the 
spring, beginning of the summer, wagons came and 
trucks and all of us had to quickly get out, get 
into these trucks, and they drove us to a slave 
labor camp.  We  didn™t know what a slave labor
 camp was, in Che mnitz. This was a whole 
different story. Chemnitz had tall fence, it had 
a wire on the top, and it 
wa s located between the 
railroad tracks and a mu nitions factor
y, where my mother and father worked. 
 

My father™s job was loading torpedoes onto a tr
uck that hauled them away to I don™t know 
where.  My mother worked in that factory wi
th a Ukrainian woman, and they became best of 
friends, these two wome n.  Now, in this camp, 
it was all di fferent. It  
was organized. We had 
other nationalities, we had French in there, 
we had Ukrainians, we had gypsies. And I never 

knew what a gypsy was.  I thought gypsies only read
 tarot cards.  They were nice people, you 
know, but I thought that™s all gypsies did.  
 
Could they tell fortunes? 
 
No, no they were just like rest 
of us. But like I said. there we
re French, there were Russian 
wome n there, there were children, ma ny, many child
ren. We were forbidden to look towards the 
railroad tracks, but I was curious, and I did look.
 I thought I could see some thing that would look 

like human beings, but there were never any peop
le at the train stati
on. I never saw people. I 
knew trains stopped there, because I could hear 
the screech of the wheels comi ng to a stop. They 

picked up some thing or delivered some thing.   

 

In this camp, we stayed from sometime from 
1944 summer, late spring, to the end of the war 
almost. My mother in Chemnitz somehow wrote 
a letter to her brother 
who was working as a 
slave laborer at a Germa n far m. Now, how my 
mother ma naged this, I don™t know. She wrote a 
letter– 

 
How she managed to write the letter, how sh
e managed to know that her brother was–? 
 
Yes, how did she know? I never learned this fr
om my mother. How did she know where to send 
this letter?  She wrote a letter and put three le
aves of tobacco, because he was a chain smoker. 
And don™t ask me  where she got the tobacco. I don™t know how these people ma naged these 

things. They must barter some how in the camp. 
Some body must have had it. And in the letter, 

she said some thing to the effect that it won™t be
 long now when the children will be fi ni shed off 

first, because of the food, the lack of food. A
nd the letter was thick. It was censored. They 
opened the letter, and they quick
ly arrest ed my father. My mother si gned the letter with the 
initial ﬁJﬂ for Janina. And some how, in their hast
e, they thought it was my father who wrote the 
letter. They came and arrested my father. They
 interrogated him all night, beat him some thing 
terrible, because he didn™t know anyt
hing, and they insisted he did.   
 

They showed my father in the 
morning the letter, and when he 
saw my mother™s initial without 
realizing he said, ﬁ™But that™s Ja
nka™s letter.™ﬂ But he was so beat
en at this point, he didn™t know 
what he was saying anymore. 

 

So he incriminated your mother
? 
 

Yeah, I™m s ure–  

 
 
It™s interesting that a pr isoner could be arreste
d, because in effect, he™s a prisoner already.
 
 

Yes, you were already a prisoner, right?  But they
 came when they realized their mi stake in the 
morning. They brought my father back, and they
 took my mother. And I 
reme mber my mother 
and my father passing each other,
 and my father said to her, ﬁ™
Janka, we now have real trouble.™ﬂ 
And my mother whispered to me  that she hid 
nine German marks, money, under the mattress. 

She said, ﬁ™If you need it, use it™ﬂ. You know, very thrifty woma n, she salvaged nine ma rks, and 
hid them in a mattress, for some day.   

 

It seems the reason my mother was really in tro
uble, not only because of that letter, but the  
Ukrainian wo ma n that she worked with ma de a su
it for her boyfriend out of
 a gray blanket, and 
he escaped. That was a successful escape. Ther
e were other successful escapes. The Germans 
thought that there was a Polish 
or some  underground working insi
dethe camp. And my mother 
and this Ukrainian girl, they worked shoulder 
to shoulder, so they must know some thing. 
They™re probably part of it. That woma n maybe wa
s, but my mother definitely wasn™t.  So, they 
arrested my mother and that woma n t oo.   

 

My mother and she were terribly beaten to re
veal name s of others. There were no others to 
reveal, and the more they denied, the more they we
re beaten. Both wome n were then sent -- this 
is already pushing towards the end of 1944 -- both 
wome n eventually were 
sent to Ravensbruck 
concentration camp. My mother in the camp, she wa
s sterilized so she would never have Œ they 
way they put it to her -- so there would be no 
more Polish bastards born in the world. That™s 

what they told her. 

 
Tape 1 Side B 
 
Never, never, never discussed, she could be a 
Polish or a German Jew but  it was some thing the 
wome n protected.  They protected ea
ch other like that, they knew.  
 

Did your mother we ar a uniform
?  
 

She did. 
 
What kind of badge or emblem di d she have on? 
 
She had her red triangle, red triangle with letter P. 
 
Red triangle, political?
 
 
Red triangle with a ﬁPﬂ, with 
a ﬁPﬂ.  I don™t know her number. 
The reason we found, tracing my 
mother™s number, her batch of numbers, could have been destroyed when Germans we re 

destroying all records, when the front was a
pproaching.  We  had found some  other wome n who 
also lost, who were there with friends.  Frie
nds™ numbers survived, re
cords, and some  wome n 
you can™t find. This is some thing we found in Po
land very often. We  me t three wome n. One was 
only listed, she said. We  went through the camp 
together, the two other wo men, their records 
were destroyed.   

 

But going back to my mother, she did spent time  
in the hospital, Revier, in Ravensbruck.  She 
told us stories that you could only stay in the 
hospital three days.  If
 you didn™t get better, you 
were admi nistered a lethal shot. 
She said her friends had falsifie
d her papers that hang over your 
bed.  Some one had died, and they hung some one else
™s papers, switching, be
cause if her original 
papers that she had come  in there with three da
ys ago stayed there, a
nd she didn™t get better and 

leave the bed, she would have received her lethal
 shot. So they switched papers some how, so she 
could stay another day or two, when she could be
 stronger and walk out. My mother was always 
determined that she would not go ﬁ™through th
e chimney.™ﬂ That was a favorite expression. 
That™s what gave them hope. That was not the wa
y she™s going to die, ju
st as her friend was. 
They™re not going to go through the chimney.   
 

Eventually, there was a German guard when my mo
ther was in the solitary, there was a German 
guard who came one ti me to my mot her with a little
 jar of vaseline.  And, he
 said mater of factly 
to her, ﬁ™My wife feels sorry for you. She sent 
you this Vaseline.™ﬂ My mother said it was a 
blessing and a curse, be cause she coul dn™t show the vaseline to any of her friends, her inma tes, 

because they would fight for it and take it away fr
om her.  She couldn™t let anyone see it, because 
she™d be accused ma ybe of stealing it some place.
 She slept with it under her armpit or between 
her legs. 

 

What did she do wi th it when she worked
? 
 

I have no idea what she did. Did she have a pocke
t, did she have underwear, did she stick it 
someplace else? But she said this is
 what she had to do to make sure
 that they didn™t steal that 
little jar of vaseline.  You couldn™t go
 to sleep with possessions like that. 
 
Was she able to use it?   
 
She did, she did, while she was in solitary, she did. She was alone. But when she came out, she 
went out to the barrack. But eventually, they se
nd her from Ravensbruck to Gross-Rosen, where 
she worked in the stone quarry. But we  rema ined in Che mnitz, the family, until spring of 1945. 

There weren™t that ma ny of us that survived. 
We  were thinned out by then. We  weren™t as 
crowded anymore. 

 
What did you do, what  was an ave rage day like for you? 
 
For children?   
 
Yes. 
 
There were German wome n who took charge of th
e children while the adults worked in the 
factory. They taught us the glories of the Third 
Re ich. They taught us how to knit scarves. We  

thought the scarves were for us
, because winter wa
s approaching. They were for their own 
children for Christma s presents. They confiscated 
all these gr een little 
scarves, and took them 
home for Christmas presesents
 for their own fami lies.  
 

I know at one point there, when my mother was gone
, I lost all interest in
 my appearance, and it 
was very important to the Germans that we be ve
ry neat and clean, and our hair be combed. But 
when my mother was arrested, and I became the moth
er in the family, I lost interest in things. 
And one time I was sitting at a long bench with my
 brother and sisters, an
d I guess I wasn™t very 
clean, or my  hair wasn™t comb
ed, I don™t know, but she grabbed me  and s he slapped me  because 
I was dirty. She called me  a dirty Po
le and I fell, I was so surprised, I fell, I lost my balance and 

fell down. And she even kicked me  once so the ch
ildren would know that it™
s very important that 
we listen and that we stay neat and clean. I re
me mber one time  there was no food, and I went to 
the dump be hind the kitchen there. There was a du
mp, and I found apple peels and potato peels. I 
was in heaven. I thought potato peels. I thought, I 
hadn™t seen a potato in so long. I brought the 
potatoes to the barrack, and the wome n were besi
de themselves with joy. How are we going to 
cook these? We want to have potatoes. We  want
 to taste potatoes. And some how they cooked the 
potatoes. I don™t know how. I reme mber eating them, and they were full of sand. I don™t think 

they washed them very well.  

 

But in 1944, in the spring, I s
uppose the front was approaching. 
The wagons came and trucks and 
they told us to take our belongi ngs, and get into the wagons. They 
took us to the outskirts of the 
city. They dumped all of us on the sidewalk. 
We  still had several hundred people. And no one 
told us what this was all about. When we were
 all on the sidewalk, the German guards lined us 
up with guns, and told us to ma rch and find the American front. We  didn™t know which way to 

go. They told us not to turn back because 
they we re going to shoot.  We  had too ma ny 
belongings. We started to leave th
ings on the sidewalk. We  s t arted to walk in the direction they 
pointed, towards the forest.   

 

As we started to wind our way through the city in
to the open field and head into the forest, some  
German people came out they whispered to us to
 stay on the road not to go into the fields 
because the fields are mi ned.  We  stayed on the ro
ad for days. We  traveled for days. We slept in 
the forest. We slept in abandoned railroad cars. 
Sometimes, we would sneak into a German barn 
if it was dark, and we could do that without any
one noticing, if the dogs didn™t bark. At this 

point, people started breaking 
up into different units. Everybody had their own idea which way 
to find the American front.  

 
You had no  escorts, no guards? 
 
No, nothing, they just let us go loose into the German population. 
 
Was your father wi th you? 
 
Yes, my mo ther was al ready in the 
Ra vensbruck, there were four of us. 
 
So your father was your guide, so to speak? 
 
Yes, he was, but the German people were afra
id of us they would ___ when we beg for food, 
they would ___, and then they would ask to spend 
the night in their shed 
or barn or some thing, 
they would say ﬁ™nay™ﬂ no, there were afraid. 
 
You were full of lice? 
 
We were dirty, you have to reme mbe r , we were 
the people that they we
re taught to hate.  
Eventually, we did find the American front. When we converged in this one place, the 
Americans didn™t know what to do 
with all of us. There were so ma ny of us, every day a new 
group of people arriving. Where 
do you house all these people?  Ev
entually, we wound up in an 

old abandoned schoolhouse, I thi
nk. The Americans sent us by mi stake into German s c hools. We  
had lost a few years of schooling. The German 
children ridiculed us. They called us a Polish 
swine, and I reme mber someone called me a Polis
h bandit, a Polish bandit
. I thought to myself, I 
have never done anything to be called a bandit. 
How did this happen?  I™m a swine and a bandit.  
That was such a puzzlement to us. We couldn™t figure this out. 
 
Did you even know what a bandit was? 

 
No, I knew it was some thing bad, ﬁbandytaﬂ in 
Polish, I know what that is. How did these 
children consider me a swine and a bandit?  What
 did I ever do?  They were dressed beautifully, 
these children. We  were in rags. 
They ma de fun of our clothes. 
They had made fun of our name s 
too, so when the Americans realized what wa
s happening, they quickly took us out of these 
schools and they formed local schools within our 
group. There were teachers there. At one point, 
we even had a priest that survived. He  was with us, a Polish priest. We  stayed in this one 

building for few months, and then it got overc
rowded, and by mi stake, some how, they shipped 
us to Buchenwald concentration camp. 

 
The Americans shipped you to Buchenwald? 
 
There were beds there. No one 
really knew how bad it was. I am sure no one knew. When we got 
to Buchenwald, and we saw what had happened in 
Buchenwald, they quickly took us out of there 
too.  And they brought us to a place, a Displaced 
Person (DP) camp at this point. Then I learned 
a name  for t his place, a DP ca mp. There were
 hundreds and hundreds of us, and the American 
took care of us, there was an organization called
 UNRA, United Nations Re
lief Agency,  I think, 
and they tried to send us back where we bel
onged. Where did we want to go?  My father 
wouldn™t go back to Poland. He was afraid because
 he had a prison record there, and he was 
positive that that record still existed, and he w
ouldn™t go back. And he wouldn™t take us children 
back, even though we had thought my mother perish
ed, and my mother thought we had perished, 
even though the slightest chance that my mother 
was alive; she mi ght be in Poland. Even that 
wouldn™t ma ke my father want to go b
ack there. He was that afraid, so–  
 
Now Poland meaning–? 
 
Communist Poland, yes.  
 
Yeah, or worse. The Russian, the area that you 
had come from, was that still part of Poland 
at the end of  the war? 
 
I don™t think so, not any more. But he woul
dn™t go back. He had very bad me mories. 
 
Now his prison record, you say he had a prison
 record in Poland, this was not under the 
Polish government, wa s it? This was under the Communist government. 
 
Communists, right. And later, he
 told u she was also afraid 
some one mi ght snitch on him for 
other activities. We  were hiding people by the 
river. We  don™t know if anyone snitched ever on 
us. Did he spend time for some  of that, too?  
I don™t think he should have, but we don™t know.  

 
As a prisoner of the Germans, did he get to
 we ar a prison uniform wi th a triangle?  
 
My father?  No, not in 
a slave labor camp, no.  
 
And you co ntinued to we ar your usual rags? 
 
Your own rags, yes. There were no un
iforms  for us in that camp, no.  
 
Do you know where and when you 
were liberated by the Americans? 
 
Spring of 1945. 
 
You don™t kno w the month or the date?  
 
Mm, mm. 
 
And the town where you were? 
 
I think we we re in Leipzig. 
 
And the DP camp?  
 
That™s what I™m thinking of, the DP camp was in Leipzig.
  
 
But you we re liberated somewhere else, not far from Leipzi g? 
 
Not far, no, very close, because this was very 
fast moving, so we couldn™t have been ve ry far 
from each place. But when, UNRA l ocated relati
ves in New York, and told them that we 
survived the war, they sponsored us, and passports
 and birth certificates had to be ma de very 
quickly. And in that same  DP ca mp, we were th
ere till January 1947 in that DP camp, from 1945 
till the beginning of 1947. We  had our own little 
schools. They tried to teach children reading, 
writing, ma th. We  even ma de hol
y communion. There was priest 
there who taught us religion 

after the war. Three of us, three out of the f
our children received holy communion. And we had 
Polish scouts, I reme mb er. I was very impresse
d. I was already a teenager, 12 by then, 12 and a 
half I was. I was terribly impresse
d that Polish people 
even had scouts. 
 
When was the last time you attended church? 
 
Oh, my God, from 1943 to 1947, I had no regular 
church, no. We prayed, but no church. Holy 
communion, they ma de a ma ke-shift church 
for us for holy communion in the DP camp. 

 
Your schooling at the DP camp, was th
at in English, German, or Polish? 
 
Polish. It was still Polish. Yeah, but we all spoke
 German at this point already. Even when I 
came here, I was able to speak German. You just 
pick up these things. Children pick up very 

quickly. And my father and mother, they could 
speak Russian, German, Ukrainian, Polish.  They 
could jump back and forth between these languages. 
 
When did you realize that your mother was alive?
 
 
 
We ca me to America in early 1947, and my mother
, when she was sent to Gross-Rosen, that is 
the rock quarry slave labor camp to work there. 
 She with her Ukrainian best friend, again, when 
the front was approaching, they
 didn™t know it was. Some thing was changing at Gross-Rosen. 
My mother noticed that the guards we re not b
eating the women, they were almost kind. So my 
mother said to her friend, ﬁ™I am going to run fo
r it tonight when it gets
 dark.™ﬂ And the woma n 
says, ﬁ™I™m going with you.™ﬂ So my mother sat un
til dark and they went for the gate. The gate 
opened when they pushed. There were no sirens, 
no dogs, no search lights. The two wome n froze 
for a second, and then took to thei
r heels, and ran into the forest
. They spent two to three days 
sleeping in the forest in dampness, until both were burning with a fever. So they deci ded that 

they™re going to enter the first house and ask for help.  

 

When they went to this one house, it was still 
dark. Lights were on inside, the door opened, and a 
ma n sees these two women in striped uniforms, with
 very short hair. He gets scared, he doesn™t 
know what to do, so he calls his wife. His wife 
come s in, and she sees the two wome n, and she 
pulls them in quickly, and clos
es the door so no neighbors woul
d see them standing there. And 
she took pity on my mot her and her friend, and sh
e said, ﬁ™You could spend time up in the attic, 
but don™t walk, because the ceiling creeks.™ﬂ  So my
 mother said they were there two, three da ys 
until the fever subsided. The woman fed them. 
She took a tremendous risk, and her ne ighbors 
could have reported her that sh
e took in two prisoners.   
 

One day, my mother hears tanks approaching th
e house. The roar was getting louder and louder, 
and closer and closer they came.  She  thought that
 that was the end for both of them. As they got 
closer to the house, she recogni
zed the language they were speak
ing, and it was Russian.  They 
were being liberated by the Sovi
et troops.  And of course, 
the two wome n r a n down, and the 
Soviet troops opened their arms, and welcomed them. They were very happy to find two of them 

alive.   

 

They were taken after that, my mother said, to
 some  holding camp, where in this camp they were 
told they can either go back to Poland or to 
Russia.  My mother, hoping we  would be in Poland, 
went to Poland. In Poland, my mo
ther gets impatient to find us; 
are we dead or alive?  So she 
pieced an address, part of an address, and wr
ote so me thing to a relative in Detroit, who knew 
some body i n New York who knew us, who found us. 
This is by this point is 1949.  They find us 
in New York. We  start corresponding. My mother ge
ts anxious to come  to the United States. She 
applies for a visa. The visa is denied by the 
Communists because she is too young, she was then 
39.  They need young people to rebuild Poland. 
We™re corresponding furiously back and forth. 

My mother gets very impatient to come . She jo
ins the Polish underground 
in Poland. She tries to 
cross the border, on the water some how. They were
 picked up off the water, three me n and two 
wome n, by a Russian trawler. And my mother winds
 up in prison again.  While she™s sitting in 
prison, her visa does come  up, but s he doesn™t know it.   

 

She told her sister when she jo
ined the underground -- she didn™t
 tell her sister that she was 
joining the underground -- all she told her sist er 
in Poland was, ﬁ™If I am in trouble, I will send 
you a post card and the st amp will be upside down. That me a ns I am in trouble.™ﬂ That™s all she 
said, and she took off one night, 
without explaining anything. But 
when she finally came out of 
prison and reapplied for her visa 
from the Communists, they told 
her you can™t leave the country, 
because you have a prison record. And this is like 1950, 1951 already.  She came  in1957 to 

America.   

 
How did she pull that?
 
 
The visa came  through; they took pity on her, finally. 

 
The Gomulka regime. 
 
The Gomulka regime , that™s right, that™s 
right. She came on August 15, 1957. I was a ma rried 
lady, my sister was ma rried. 
 
It™s a Holy Day. 
 
That™s right, you reme mbered, good boy.  

 

Boy? 
(laughter) 

 

And we picked her up at. I reme mber picking he
r up at LaGuardia. I don™t know why LaGuardia 
sticks out in my head. But I only had like a 
week™s notice that she was comi ng. That™s how 

quickly. A telegram arrived, that™s it, ﬁ™Meet me  
at LaGuardia.™ﬂ I went there with my husband. I 
didn™t recognize her. I wa s looking for a different
 kind of woma n, the woma n that I reme mbered. 
This is more than 15 years later. It wa sn™t 
anything what I expected, and I wasn™t what she 
expected. 

 
Was your father still around? 
 
He was. He didn™t come  to the airport with us. 
He couldn™t do it. Emotiona
lly, he just couldn™t do 
it. 
 
Where did your mother stay during these years in Poland? 
 
She knew her sister; this was Klodzko, Poland. 
 
So she did not return to her hometown?  

 
No, not that way, no, the opposite almost, the oppos
ite end of Poland, near the German border, 
the Czechoslovakian 
border, I think. 
 
And when did you know that she 
was alive through all of this? 
 

In about 1949– 
 
So when she applied for the vis
a, she knew you were in America?
 
 
Oh yes, she knew. That™s way she applied for the 
visa then. Piecing little 
bits and pieces of the 
address that she reme mb ered in her head. 

 
So all those years you thought that she was de ad? 
 
Oh yeah, yeah
– 
 
And when y ou had left her in–when was that ? 

 
That was in about the end of 1944. 
 
That is whe n she left you? 

 
Yes, we were separated. 
 
In Ravensbruck, that was the good bye– 
 
Yes, that was last time. 
 
Did she get a chance to say goodbye to you then? 

 
No, they were hustling her very fast. I™m 
sure no one thought it was a goodbye. I don™t think 
anyone thought that way at that time , mm 
mm. Some times people ask about our childhood. 
There was no childhood for people 
like us. There was nothing.   
 
So when di d you reach adulthood, 1943?  
 
Probably, probably when everything -- I was the moth
er, definitely in the 
European tradition, the 
oldest child takes the place of th
e parent that ™s not ther e. I was the mother.  When my mother 
arrive d in Ne w York, I was ma rri
ed, my sister wa s ma rried, my 
brother was courting seriously a 
young girl, Polish girl.  My younge
st sister, the baby, who was 
pushing 19 already, 18, 19, she 
was getting ready to leave and go to the convent.   
 

My mother found four adults, not children.  Sh
e didn™t understand why we celebrated birthdays, 
not feast days, because in Poland at that time  we
 celebrated the saints.  She couldn™t understand 

why we do that. She couldn™t understand Tha
nksgiving, why would you celebrate a turkey. 
Didn™t ma ke sense.  We  spoke English amongst our
selves. That hurt my mother, I know it did.  
A lot of things -- we never, 
really, really bounded after that
. Now that I™m mother and a 
grandma, I understand. We never, never bonded af
ter that. There was something torn, lost 
forever.  That childhood bonding that occurs in norm
al average fa milies never returned to us.  It 
was different, and I™m sure my mothe r
 felt it until the day she died.   
 

She used to say, ﬁ™I welcome death, that™s okay, th
at™s okay.™ﬂ She was alwa
ys disappointed that 
people did that to people, what she saw, people 
did it to people, and that bothered her always, 
that she had to witness. And I 
found out my mother would talk 
about her experience. That™s why 
I know so much more, because I aske d, and I kept 
a jour nal of things she said. My father had 
nightma res till the day he  died. He would not talk
. If we talked about the Holocaust, he  would 
hear the subject beginning in the room, and he 
would walk out of the room. He woul dn™t stay. 
He™d go and lie down, and for good measure, he woul
d put the pillow over his head, turn towards 
the wall, and want nothing to do with us.  And he 
had endured a lot. He could have told us the 
stories how he had to take care of four childr
en. What were his thoughts,
 trying to shelter and 
keep these children alive?  Never talked. 
 
Whom do you think suffered the mo
st, your mother, you, your father? 
 
I think my mother. She was alone. We were toge
ther, four children and a father. We  stayed 
together. But she was separated all by herself. 

 
As a prisoner in a sense. 
 
Yeah. 

 
The Ukrainian friend was no s ubs titute. 
 
Well, it™s good to have a friend, you know. She rema
ined with that woma n to the end. And then, 
when they were liberated, each went her own way. 
 
Do you know when and where she was liberated? 
 
No. 
 
Somewhere  outside Gross-Rosen by Russian troops in the spring of 1945.  
 
Yes. 
 
What was t he worst experien
ce for you during these years?
 
 

I think when I heard in Germany after the war th
at -- I heard that they 
burned people and that 
they put their ashes in jars and la
beled the jars.  I wanted to find a 
place like that with jars so that 
I could be convinced that she™s al
ive or she™s dead.  It used to 
haunt me , that story that I heard 
about the jars of ashes, and that th
e Germans labeled them so meticulously. 
 
So the fear, the suspicion that your 
mother was dead, that was the worst?
 
 
This was at the end, already. We  were liberated, bu
t in the camp itself, it 
wasn™t the lack of food 
that was hurting the mos t , it™s the separation 
from the mother. And then you know the father 
would be working all day in the factory, and I 
wa s never sure if he would come  back home  
either. And you would be there all day without 
mother, without father. These German wome n 

ma king fun of you and teaching you things that you didn™t know why they were teachi ng you 
these things. What is our future?  Wh y are you teaching me  all these things, what for? 

 
How did you view the Germans?
 
 
At that time, I was confused. I knew they were ba
d, but I didn™t know why. No one told us. See, I 
thought throughout the war, when I 
heard grownups talking, I thought
 that Hitler hated people, 
and he hated Poles. I didn™t know
 at that time  yet anything about  the fate of the Jews. That 

wasn™t discussed in front of us children, ever. 

 
Did you know any Jews wh
en you were growing up? 
 
In the village, yes, but I didn™
t know they were Jews. I found out
 later that these people -- I 
thought they were just Poles, because they 
spoke Polish. No, I never knew the difference. 
 
There were no Jewi sh collective farmers?
 
 
No,  I didn™t see anything like that. When I 
came to America, I heard, when we lived in 
Brooklyn, our first place, adults talking at the ki
tchen table, and my father saying, ﬁ™My god, my 
god, I should have seen what they were doing to 
the Jews.™ﬂ  And I thought to myself, the Jews, 
and then I heard it again, ﬁ™to the Jews™ﬂ. I said
 to myself, how come  no one
 says what they were 
doing to us, too?   And that was my first experien
ce that  Hitler  was out to
 destroy all the Jews. 
And I was already in America when I learne
d this. We  were never told these things. 
 
 
And this wa s from your father
–?  
 
From my father, yes. 

 
Who, really -- did he even see what
 Hitler was doing to the Jews? 
 
He saw. I saw Hitler in a parade some place when 
we were in Germany. He was in a sidecar of a 
motorcycle. I was very impressed with the 
way they were ma rching in this parade. 
 
You literally saw him? 
 
I saw him. 
 
This was when you we re in– 
 
This was some ti me  in 1943. It wasn™t in 
1943, it was some time in 1944. We were being 
transported fr om this Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau) to another camp, and there was a parade 

going. And we had to stop because of throngs and 
throngs of people. We got off the wagons and 
we were standing, trying to see what was going 
on. My father lifted me , and my father said, 
ﬁ™You see that, that ™s Hitler.™ﬂ I had no idea w
ho Hitler was. All I remember is, he stood there 

and he was doing his ﬁ‚Heil Hitler!™ﬂ Who is that 
person?  I had no idea. Y
ears later, my father 
remi nded me of that. I had no idea. 
 
But this is Hitler on para
de, not for killing people? 
 
Parade Œ oh no, no, no on parade, no, no, no. This wa
s people screaming and shouting. And I had 

no idea who this famous  or infamous  person was at that time . 

 
No, I was referring to your fath
er™s remark, ﬁ™You should have 
seen what they we re doing 
to the Jews.™ﬂ The fact is, he wasn™t even seeing the worst–  
 
Hi ms elf. He  still, he felt sorry for what they
 were doing to the Jews. That™s why he was saying, 
ﬁ™My god, my god, you should see what they were
 doing to the Jews.™ﬂ But my father died 
peacefully. My mother died in her sl eep. 

 

You will never know what their mo
st terr ifying experience  was
. 
 

There were so ma ny, my father story?  I can only
 tell you what his nightma re. I can tell you to the 
day he died, he used to beat th
e wall with his fi st s and scream. 
And he was always dreaming that 
the Ukrainians were killing him;  that they were 
successful; they butchering. He told us this, this 
was from his lips. That was his mos t  horrible ni
ghtma re. He was so afraid of being killed that 
way. 

 
And as it turned out, they took hi s farm. 
 
They took his farm. They were happy, I suppose. They
 took the farm, they got what they wanted.   
 
And your most terrifyi ng 
experience during the war? 
 
I think bombs falling, probably. Whe n the sire
ns go off, you don™t know where to hide your 
head. Usually, when the sirens would go off, becau
se we were between the railroad tracks and 
the munitions factory, so the Allies we re trying to
 bomb one or the other.  I didn™t know where to 
run. We had no mother. My father couldn™t co
me and grab us quick enough. Where do four 
children run?  Where do we hide?  That was scary,
 when there was no one to look after us, no one. 
 
And you di dn™t know whose bombs they we r e ? 
 
No we didn™t know, no. 

 
And it probably would not have occurred 
to you that these were friendly bombs. 
 
No. I reme mber one time , planes came and leaf
lets were dropped. The whole area was covered 
with some  kind of leaflet. I h
eard them talking later that  the leaflets said so mething Œ that 
ﬁ™Hitler give up, you never win th
is war.™ﬂ But who dropped these 
leaflets, I have no idea. No 
one ever told us. So I don™t know where they cam
e from. Was  it the Britis
h or -- I have no idea, 
no idea. 

 
When did you, your father, since he  was the brains
 of the family, at this
 point, realize that 
the end was in sight, that this 
will not go on forever, this prison? 
 
I think, when they threw us from the city. They
 said go. They didn™t know what to do with us. 
 
So very late? 
 
Yes. I™m sure everybody thought that we™re not
 going to ma ke it, because they were 

systematically starving. People who died, childr
en would die. I woul
dn™t see actually dead 
children, but I knew there were children were 
mi ssing, and I never questioned, where did they 
go?  Their parents are still there, where did they
 go?   There™s a child mi ssing from this fa mily, 
there™s a child from that. And eventually they 
would replace; they would send new people for the 
work, for the labor, because that mun
itions factory was very important.   
 

As a matter of fact, I went back to Germany la
st summer, and I went back to Chemni tz, and I 
stood where that camp was, and I recognized the ra
ilroad tracks. And I said to my hus band as I 
looked, I said, ﬁ™In back of me  
there should be a factory.™ﬂ And he said, ﬁ™Turn around.™ﬂ When I 
turned around, there™s the factory. 
It™s all there.  When I asked 
the German woma n in town about 
the camp, did she see it?  She says ﬁ™Yeah.™ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁ™We ll, I was there.™ﬂ And she says, ﬁ™That™s 
impossible, there were no children in there.™ﬂ
 And I said, ﬁ™Madam, there were ma ny c hildren 
there.™ﬂ  She said, ﬁ™That™s impossible, we 
would have known.™ﬂ I said, ﬁ™When you saw people 

in there, behind the wire, didn™t you wonder?™ﬂ  
ﬁ™Oh no,™ﬂ she said, ﬁ™You™re not allowed to 
asked questions. You don™t know who you are talki
ng to. They mi ght report you, and you™ll go to 
a concentration camp, so you ask nothing.™ﬂ 

 
You don™t even take a close look.
 
 
Well, she didn™t. She didn™t know
 there where children there. 
 
And you we ren™t children any more. 
 
No, no, we looked like children, though. But she wa
s convinced that there were no children 
there.  So ma ny people, and she didn™t know. No
 one asked who were we, what were you doing 
there. Nobody cared. 

 
So this was the we lcome that you got. You were fleeing the Ukrainians. 
 
Yeah, always r
unning from somebody. 
 
And Germany turned out to be a prison camp for you. Your crime? 
 
Being Polish. 

 
Being Polish, being refugees?
 
 

No, we were their labor. 
 
Your parents had not committed any sabotage
, or rose up against the German regime? 
 
Nothing, nothing.  An aunt of mi ne who left Poland
 with us at the same  time, she was pregnant, 
and gave birth to a baby in Freiburg (Freiburg 
im Breisgau). They took the baby from her, and 
drained the blood for the German troops. And even
tually, in a few weeks, the baby died. My 
grandmother worked for a German bower, a farm. 
She was fed so poorly that she just died of 
starvation there, they were so cruel. 

 
So family members perished? 
 
Yeah, yeah. It™s so hard to imag
ine things like that if you™ve lived
 in freedom all your life, like in 
America. It™s so hard. Some ti me s children say 
to me , ﬁ™ Why didn™t you protest? ™ﬂ We ll, who, to 
whom, wher e?  Who was going to listen to you?   I think, in Poland, probably, it was a paradox. 

We were victims, and yet some  ma na ged to be 
rescuers of others. Some  Poles were lucky enough 
to have saved some  Jews .  It™s a paradox to me  th
at they could have done 
that, and they did, they 
did. 

 
Your younger brothers and sisters all survived? 
 
Yes, my youngest sister died of cancer a
bout five, six years a
go. The rest are fine. 
 
Do you have anything to add, additional reflections?  
 
The older I get, the wiser I ge
t, the less I understand. Why?  Why?
 Why?  I™m so disappointed in 
people, some times, that we do that to each other. I don™t know why, wha t  for?  We  all look so 

much alike, feel the same  way, hurt. There™s so mu
ch more that binds us than divides us, and yet 
we take sometimes pride in dividing from others as
 if we™re different.  I™ve seen that in Europe, 
now with national pride comi ng i
n, and that worries me . Human pride would have been so much 
better.  

 
Will it ever end? 
 
N o  mo r e  fo r  me .  

 
Thank you for your story.
