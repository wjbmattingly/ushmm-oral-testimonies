Interview with Irena Frisch 
February 22, 1992 
Teaneck, New Jersey 
 
My name  is Irene Frisch.  My ma iden name  used to be Bienstock.  In Poland it was Irena 
Bienstock.  I was born on May 3, 1931 in a small town in Poland.  The town was called 

Drohobycz.  I had a very nice childhood until the war.  I grew up as the youngest of three 

children of Izrael and Ewa Bienstock.  My fath
er was in thread?  business.  He was a very 
prosperous businessman who was quite known 
in the town, who had ma ny friends.  I 
don™t say it was a poor family and it was very priv
ileged, rich life.  I am
 here to tell you 
my story because I feel I owe it to Frania 
Osobkowa.  Her maiden name  was Babecka.  

She was a very proud Polak, a Polish woma n, 
very devout Catholic, the most beautiful 
huma n being I have seen in my life, good and 
selfless and helpful and 
it is her that I am 
thankful, that it is for her that I am he re t
oday to tell my story.  Frania worked in our 
house as a housekeeper.  My mother hired he
r when she was very young and she came  to 
work for us before I was born.  She took care of
 my older brother, of
 my  sister and then 
eventually with me.  It™s time to say that 
at the beginning she didn™t like me  because she 
resented having to take care of three ch
ildren.  She knew all her friends had only two 
children to take care of and here she is, st
uck with three children. 
 My mot her understood 
that she was very devoted to us so my mother 
didn™t want to lose her and after a time  she 
hired some body else to take care of me .  But 
after a while she got very careless and we 
never could have anybody, and Frania, of cour
se, she was not educated, she didn™t know 
how to write or to read.  She was a very 
intelligent woman and today when I see the 

children are insecure and have to go to psyc
hologists, I am thinking how lucky I was to 
be brought up by a woman who had so much
 common sense that we never had any 
security problems.  We  always believed th
at we were the best, smartest and most 
beautiful.  Fr ania believed this and she instilled 
it in us.  And I am very grateful to her for  

ma ny, many things in my life.  During the wa
r, we were not, in the beginning, we were 
not really touched with that.  She was alre
ady a ma ture woman and 
she lived outside of 
our house.  Her husband went to war and 
she did not have any children and she was 
working me nial work in a factory and when th
e time came that my parents saw that there 
was absolutely no way for me  to survive, that
 as a last resort, they sent some body ahe a d 
and asked her if she could help out.  And she 
said, ﬁNaturally, I expect to take care of 
them.  And i f you are not here after the war, 
I will have her christened and she will gr ow 
up as my childﬂ. 

 

I know how to pray in Polish because of the 
prayers more better 
than I know my own 
prayers.  She taught me  I -- know it all -- I know
 about holidays.  I sp
ent with her two and 
a half years.  I reme mber we didn™t have mu
ch to eat, we were very, very poor because 
my mother did not have any -- she eventually
 took in my mother and my sister.  We  
didn™t have any money, we lost 
everything and we had to live on the little money that she 
was earning in the factory which ma ybe woul
d have been enough for one person but she 
had to feed four people on that. Most of 
the time we were hungry.  Frania went to a 
neighbor and was offered a cup of tea with a 
lump of sugar.  She would sneak the sugar 
in her pocket and bring it home.  My mother
 and two children;  I wonder if I could do it 
for my children.

Basically, even today I believe in providen
ce and I believe in things that happened 
because they were meant to be.  I do not beli
eve too much in praying.  I ha ve seen ma ny 

times in life that things have been just  b
ecause  probably God meant it so or whatever we 

call some  kind of spiritual power
.  It is interesting how we
 were rescued by Frania, how 
Frania came  into our life.  When my moth
er was a cucooman, she helped me find my 
other brother, and he was a little chu
bby, cute baby.  Once she took the baby in the 
carriage and went to park.  On the way to
 park, she was stopped by a young peasant girl, 
who like mo st of the peasants in Poland, was 
wearing a long skirt in
 front of the wading 
pool and she was very poor and she wa s bare
foot.  She stopped by my
 mother™s carriage 
and she said, ﬁOh, what a beautiful baby you 
have there!ﬂ  Na turally, each young mother 
thinks that her baby is beautiful and she was ve
ry flattered and she says really because it 
was a boy so my mother told her.  And she 
said, ﬁCan I stop and play with him a little 
bit? ﬂ  And she took the rattle and was playing 
and my mother saw that she liked the baby.  
She told her how old she was, ma ybe fifteen 
or sixteen years old and my mother said 
what are you doing here and she said you know, I come  for the employment and my 

father died ve ry young and I was working for th
e priest s, I was ---.  She started to work 
when she was five years old in the little village and she was mi nding the geese.  The 

priest had some  geese so he took a five-yea
r old girl and gave her a stick and she was 
mi nding the geese.  And then as she was growing up, she was promoted to more 

important jobs.  She was helping in the k
itchen, and in the gardens and when she was 
sixteen years old or fifteen, her mother said
 for her to start making some  real money.  
Because in the village, she could not ma ke 
any money, she just worked there and she got 
food.  They were poor people with ma ny children 
so food to feed a child was a treasure.  
So when she was like fifteen years old, she came 
to us.  She said, ﬁI came here, I told my 
mother -- I came  here to look for a jobﬂ.  Wh
at do you want to do?   ﬁI would like to care 
of a child, help in the houseﬂ.  So my  mother said come  to me , you have a job.  She had a 

little ke rchi ef and in her kerchief, she 
had (???????????????) .  S
o, my mot her brought 
her home, people didn™t ask for references like
 people ask today and they gave her a bed.  
She was very happy to take care of the baby, mo
stly, it was more to it.  She was very 
good to him and from my parents, it was very 
thoughtful that they could realize that we 
had more help in the house.  
But she really took care of my
 br other and then my sister 
and as I have me ntioned before, I came  al
ong.  I don™t think I was really _____, it was not 
the style of mi ddle class, upper class people to ha ve three children.  It was stylish to have 

one or two but when I came  along she was very 
ma d that she did not really want to bother 
with me  too much so my  parents had to 
hire some body else, you ma y remember.  I was 

told many times about this, my brother and si
ster used to tease me
, Frania doesn™t like 
you like she likes us but eventua
lly she did love me  as much as anybody else.  So when I 
came into hiding, she took me from ghetto, as 
I me ntioned to you, she came  at night, she 
took me  out and we went walking and we went singing the carols and even today I 

reme mber the carol s and I love Christmas like 
very much.  As a matter of fact, the first 
Christmas after I married, alre
ady, in the United St ates, I was with my hus band our first 
Christma s in Atlantic City and I said
 ________ because I don™t believe you Œ the 
Catholic religion.  Today I am a practicing Jew 
more or less, and I said to my husband we 
have to go to services so, my friends, Chri
stmas as a married woman, I went with my 
husband in Atlantic City to Christmas Night 
which was not as meaningful as it was in 

  
 
3
Poland but she took me  out of the ghetto on 
Christma s Night and she took me  to her 
house and took very good care of me .  And gave 
me  very mu ch love.  Then she thought I 
am not happy, I was mi s sing my parents, so 
she brought over my sist
er and my mother.  
She could not do much for my father because she did not have  much space in her 
apartment.  We were lucky to meet my fath
er after the war.  Most of my friends, my 
Jewish friends, did not survive.  I had very
 wonderful friends from before the war that 
didn™t survive the war.  Since Frania was ba
sically a very poor woma n and did not have 
much money, she lived in a very small apartmen
t.  It was one room, that was living room, 
dining room and everyt hi ng and a small kitchen and there was no place for us to hide---  

it was very starkly furnished, she had the be
d, one bed, she had the sofa and she had a 
closet, but this -was it, a small closet, a tabl
e and four chairs.  There was not much room 
for us, no place to hi de.  But in Europe, the 
bed was fixed with all kinds of pillows, and 
covers and then you had a big, long bedcover 
and the bedcover woul
d go to the floor.  
When I was alone, for a while, I would get 
along without my mother and without my 
sister, I was spending all  my days undernea
th the bed.  I was not allowed to move 
because neighbors shouldn™t hear. It was an ap
artment, not really, th
e apartment she lived 
in, she shared with another family so there was not even a wall between the two 

apartments. It was one big apartment broken in
to two or three, and 
they were separated 
by a door so on the other side of the door ther
e lived another fa mily.  If I would move 
during the day and the neighbors knew that 
Frania was at work, it would be very 
suspicious so I was not even allowed to 
cough, not to breathe loud because on the other 

side of the door there lived a family, there 
lived an older woman who was all day at home  
and she would have noticed that something is
 going on in the apartment.  They all knew 
that Frania is at work so I 
practically stayed under the bed mo
st of the time.  However, I 
suppose, ma ybe, at one point the neighbors gr
ew, some how, suspicious.  Maybe, they 
didn™t grow suspicious, ma ybe it looked so. 
 There was a point when I was _____ with 
my mother and my sister and 
we found out that the ghetto is
 being liquidated.  It means 
that all the Jews from ghetto have been ki
lled.  Frania, in the evening, went to the 
bathroom or some thing, which was on the outside of the porch and she st
arted to talk to a 
neighbor and the neighbor ma de some  comme
nt about the Jews being killed and the 
neighbor was not very sorry about it, no, a nd the neighbor said to Frania, ﬁDo you know 

what?   Some  of our people are stupid enough to
 help the Jews?ﬂ  She said what did that 
mean.  ﬁSome of our people are hiding the Jews!ﬂ  Now, you can imagine.  Frania came 

home  and we had altercation, we were close 
enough.  We  got very upset and Frania said 
to my mother, ﬁI had a feeli
ng that she suspects some thingﬂ
.  Maybe she didn™t suspect, 
ma ybe it was just a general statement, but Fran
ia had a plan.  So th
e next day she decided 
she™s not going to work.  Some how she notifie
s the place of work, there™s no telephone so 
she notifies the place of work a
nd she says ﬁI™m not comi ng to work today.  I have to take 
a kitchen dayﬂ, or whatever she ma de up.  She told her neighbor my
 hous e is really so 
neglected, I have to take ge
neral cleaning, ma ke general cleaning – She opens all her 
windows, all her doors and started to tear the 
apartment apart, cleaning.  She wanted the 
people to see, to come  in, to be able to come  
in to the apar tment and 
to see that she really 
does not have  anyone.  So, as evidence, we 
have to go from under the be d because it™s 

too dangerous.  She put my mother in a closet.  She put my mother in a closet which 

looked like today™s armoire and my poor mother 
was sitting in that cl
oset, my mother was 
a tall woma n, taller than I and I am not a sma
ll thing.  My sister and I were stuffed in a 

  
 
4
box.  The box looked like a huge suitcase, not a suitcase, a chest, some  kind of chest that 
was really given to her by my parents.  My
 father was bringing furs??  His me rchandise 
from the groat in that chest.  My sister and I,
 we were sitting, like fo
rged together  in that 
chest, an she opened a little
 bit the cover and put some th
ing, some  food, we should not 
choke on it.  We  cover and we were sitting 
there for two hours rigid, not being able to 
move.  Finally, after Frania ma de big order 
in the house, airing, took 
the beds apart, took 
the ma ttresses outside so the people could 
see and neighbors came  in and ‚Oh, Mrs. 
Osobkowa we have never been to your room™.  So she showed her apartment, the 

ma ttress was out and the bed was empty.  N
obody could even believe that there was --- 

that some things were -- -.  She was very resour ceful and a very intelligent woman to do 

that.  It was month of the infidel??   

 

I reme mber another incident when she came home in the evening from work and was 

completely pale.  We could see that her face wa
s white and she said, ---.  My mother said, 
ﬁFrania what happened?   It seems that you are 
very disturbed.ﬂ  Frania said, ﬁYes, as I 
was comi ng home , I passed by the marketﬂ.  It wa s the ma in place of the town so for 

Drohobycz, it was like a ma rket place.  ﬁAnd you know what I saw?   They caught a 

fa mily of Jews that were hidden by Polish people and they hanged them in the 

ma rketplace.  Together they were hanging.  Th
e Jewish people together with the Polish 
peopleﬂ.  So my mother said, 
ﬁYou know, Frania, I feel so sorry for youﬂ.  So she said, 
ﬁDon™t feel sorry for me ﬂ.  She had two big pi
ctures of saints, Maria and Jesus.  She too 
the big picture of the ma n, holy picture and 
hung it over my mother™s sofa .  She going to 
take care of it.  This today when I travel
 with my husband, I always come  in a town, I 
always go to church.  And I always give mone
y and I always take a candle and light it.  
She believed, my good friend. 

 
I could tell you ma ny mo re st
ories about Frania™s generosi
ty and beautiful hands.  I 
reme mber one day when we went to sleep.  We  were very poor, we were very hungry.  
We had nothing already to sell and we went
 to sleep often, very hungry.  We didn™t 
_________.  And at night, we hear some body mo
ving around.  I open my eyes and see 
Frania shaking and she says, get up.  I say, what
 is it?   She says, I don™t know, I couldn™t 

sleep.  I cooked some thing.  I found some  bl
ack flour in the kitchen on cupboard and I 

make little du mplings and I put a little sacchar
ine.  Come, we™ll a
ll eat together.  She 
woke up my  mother and my si
ster to share the food with 
me .  Then came Christma s and 
we wanted to do some thing for her because 
she was believi ng in Christ mas and it was 
important to her.  We knew that it is importa
nt and we also knew th
at she was deprived of 
ma ny things because she had to share everythi
ng with us.  So I reme mber my sister was 
quite resourceful and found some  ol d pajama s 
or whatever and ma de a little baby dress 
out of it.  She was a young girl, but very daint
y.  She made some little things.  We gave it 

to Frania and she went to the ma rket.  She sold it.  She had a little money. I still 

reme mber the little apron or dress that my 
sister ma de or ma ybe it was a baby dress and 

an apron.  She was like fourteen -- or fifteen 
years old girl but she was very good with her 
hands.  We  had a little bit money and Frania
 bought some  flour, ma ybe s o me  pottery.  I 
don™t think we had ________money then.  And then
 we went to another baking, cakes for 
her.  The cakes were a sort of pancake.  We
 cannot reme mb er.  We  didn™t have yeast, so 
we couldn™t grow.  We  put some  kind of powde
r.  I reme mbe r  when we often would take 

  
 
5
the ________ to bite.  They were flat.  They 
were not good.  We prete
nded that they were 
cake.  It was Easter.  She came from the chur
ch.  In Poland, it is ve
ry important to bring 
the food, the priest should bless it.  She took 
the food cakes to church and the food cake 
was blessed.  And we pret
ended that everything is good 
and delicious.  We actually 
started like that.  Then, the Russians were
 comi ng closer and closer.  We  never knew 
what is going on outside.  Naturally sh
e didn™t have a radio.  She couldn™t buy a 
newspaper because it would be suspicious.  People, her ne ighbors, knew that she di d not 

know how to write or to read. 
 So she would come  up with a 
newspaper, it would have to 
be everything we did had to be very calcula
ted.  But we heard some  nois e s, we heard like 
shooting, artillery going.  One day, the Russianscame to the town and we were liberated.  

We went out.  She did not want ever me n
tion, her neighbors to know about it because I 
am e mbarrassed to tell you that ma ny of the neighbors were very anti-Semitic and many 

said that it was good that the Jews were ki
lled.  So she did not 
want to antagonize the 
neighbors so we came out.  And we couldn™t 
come back to the house because we did not 
want to embarrass her in front of her 
neighbors.  I don™t reme mber such a great 
childhood.  We had very bad experience because th
e Russian soldiers were not nice to us.  
They say to my mother, you must have 
done something wrong.  You mus t  have 

collaborated with the Germans.  Otherwise you wouldn™t have survived.  We  were 

expecting so much symp athy from a ________ af
ter the war and we were all the time 
planning what the whole world is going to try to
 compensate us for our experience.  This 

came from the Russian soldiers and they said, when my mother told them she was 

Jewish, ﬁYou must have collaborated with th
e Germans.  Otherwise ---ﬁ  So, you know, 
we had double problems, you know.  So we found some  other Jewish family and we 

stuck together for two days until we found so
me  kind of an apartment.  We had nothing 
to eat, we had no food, we had no mo ney.  My
 mo ther found, me t some one, an old friend, 
also a Jewish woma n, who unfor
tunately lost her two sons 
and survived with her husband 
in Poland.  And when she told my mother of
 the two children, she ga
ve her some  money.  
She had some money left .  She gave my mo
ther money and said go and buy meat for you, 
buy some  br ead.  And very soon my mother got to Frania and was working _____  

______.  She got a job in a dairy of some  ki
nd of, not factory, but they were doing all 
kinds of ma king or producing their product. 
 And whenever she could steal some thing, 
she would bring it to us.  
Then she never stopped caring. 
 

What I wanted to say, that eventually we 
left Poland and in 1949 or 1950, we left Poland 
and we went to Israel.  As I me ntioned befo
re, I am the third of three children.  And we 
are only two today.  I had a brot
her who was five and a half 
years older than me  and in 
the beginning of the war, he 
got sick and due to bad conditi
ons, he could not be properly 
diagnosed.  Just today, I talk 
to my sister, and we are wonde
ring what really happened to 
him. I have a feeling that he had walking pne
umonia.  He was fourteen years old when he 
died, at the very beginning of 
the war.  It was a terribl e tragedy; it was the fi rst time that I 
encountered death.  In the time 
later, it became  a daily tre
nd.  I have seen it so ma ny 
times that ---.  But it was the first time, it was a terrible tragedy,_________ of all 

fa milies.  Needless to say, Frania was shat
tered, almost unbelievabl e, as my mother.  
They went together to the f uneral and they were both cryi
ng like they both loved him 
very, very much.  She still, to the end, alwa
ys talked about him.  It was her baby, it was 
the baby that changed her whole life.  This was the baby, that because of the baby she 

  
 
6
came into our fa mily.  The baby was fourteen 
years old.  He was very big, he was very 
tall, he was a huge young ma n, to have him for her baby.  Many times later, my mother 

said, you know, Frania, it is a good thing that he 
died.  Because if he didn™t die, he would 
be killed.  This one got killed, and this -- 
most of his friends got  killed.  And Frania 
would say, no, I would never let him be killed. 
 I would have prevented it.  So, we were 
left in the ghetto with our pa
rents.  In 1945, one year after our
 town was liberated, we still 
did not live together.  Frania was still emba
rrassed that she saved Jews.  She came to our 
house only in the evening, people shouldn™t see, 
but we were in constant touch.  We  had 
seen that?  Over time , Polish people would be
 evacuated to the new Polish territory and 
we all left Poland.  We  c onsidered ourselves 
Polish citizens and all 
Polish citizen left.  
Only the Ukrainians remained there.  We we
re traveling in very primitive trai ns and it 
took a long time , four weeks, 
until we arrived at our destination.  Many, many times that 
she was traveling with us together, we were 
already together, and one more thing.  People 
came from concentration camps and people told 
us that they saw my father in Auschwitz, 
in Plaszow, in Bielitz, in Germany, i n diffe
rent concentration camps.  The r e were even 
some  people who said that he was dead.  Ther
e  we r e  s o me  me n  t h a t  ca me  t o  my  mo t h e r  

and said, ﬁYou are a widow.  Why don™t 
we get ma rried?ﬂ  Men_______ who loved their 
fa milies.  My mother was not interested in
 getting ma rried agai n and we were going to 
Poland and we were sure that my father 
is dead.  One morning, on the train, I was 
sleeping, as usual, next to Frania, and she w
oke me  up.  She said, ﬁLook, who is here!ﬂ  I 
had a pet name that they called me at home,when I was a little gi
rl.  She always called 
me  by that name , a funny little name  and she 
called me  by that name .  She shook me  and 
said, ﬁLook who is here.ﬂ  Here I see my father
 stepping in front of the train, in front of 
our compartment, tall and handsome and dash
ing through the train, well dressed, with a 
big bag and I thought I see a ghos
t.  I was screaming and I was petrified.  I jumped on 
him and he was there, he was real, he hugged me
 and he kissed me .  A fe w mi nutes later, 
I say, ﬁDaddy, what do you have in that bag? ﬂ  Because I reme mber when he was coming 

from all his trips from the road, before the wa
r, there was always mo
st beautiful gifts for 
us.  Believe it or not, he was not sure th
at we were alive.  Some body had some  vague  
rumors that we were alive but
 he attributed them to _____.  He had very fa ncy raincoats 
for my sister and for me , blue raincoats and th
ey were in that bag!  So when I opened the 
bag, here was a gift for me .  He had prepared
 just in case he needed them.  We  were 
reunited with Father and for the next few mont
hs, my father, every day after business, he 
was taking home , closing the door, closing th
e windows, and my father would tell us 
horror stories about concentration camps.  Horror 
stories.  The last year, I went for a visit 
to Poland and from Cracow, I took a tour, 
a bus to Auschwitz.  When I was walking 
through Auschwitz, it seemed to me  that I wa
s there before because I saw all the places 
that my father was telling us.  What happene
d here and what happened there, for a mo nth, 
everything he walked, ________.  He was telling 
us how this died and how that died and 
how this died and all the people that we
 knew, young boys, young girls, people, how -- 
what people went through, he sat every eveni
ng and we were listeni
ng to him talk about 
the problem.   So when I came to concentr
ation camp, to Aus c hwitz, I felt I know all 
about it, no doubt about it.  
It was not me  talking. 
 

Anyway, we  lived in Legnica and I went thr
ough high school there.  
Right after the war, 
in Poland, also my father was a good businessm
an and financially we were doing okay.

But it was terrible and I could not __
______________.  But some how pe ople ma nage and 
people look always for the good things, for th
e nice things, but there weren™t very ma ny 
people that were nice to us
 including a principal of 
Ga ma ti who ma de up his mi nd, 
Professor Bodola -- he  must be a dead ma n no
w because it was in 1946 or ™47, that I went 
to this ma n.  He decided that he does not know
 the Jewish kids in the high school, he was 
principal.  And my father who was an educat
ed ma n, told him that I knew how to talk to 
him and tells him that he will go to the Mi
nist ry of Education, of Departme nt of 
Education in Warsaw to fi nd out why I can™t  
be ad mitted to this high school.  So, he 
admitted me  because he had no choice .  But for 
two years, he made my life mi serable.  I 
cannot even begin to tell you 
and I don™t know how I wanted so much to go to school.  I 
know my ki ds never wanted so much to go to
 school and they had not the condition.  It 
was the most important thing for me to go to
 school.  Maybe because I mi ssed it so much, 
I wanted to be part of -- ha
ve a norma l life.  So Professor Bodola was a principal of that 
high school, and was teaching classes and I wa s starting humanities in high school and I 

had every day from eight to ten o™clock, Lati
n.  Every morning from eight to ten, he had 
the __________.  No ma tter what I did, no ma tter 
what I say, my father hired a private 
tutor and the private tutor sa
id to my father, I don™t know, I cannot teach her any more 
because she knows almo st as much as I do.  But 
in the class, I always got an F.  At one 
point, I was translating some
thing, I don™t remember and there was a word, tyrum?? 
_______ is a ______.  So some body s a id, have you ever seen a lamb? .  I said yes, where?   

I said, in a meadow???  No an
swer.  Sit down.  And for two 
years, for three semesters, 
which was three quarters, I was getting an F a
nd I was sure that I am going to fail.  If you 
get one respect ??  So we had a very
 good ______. One day Mr. Bodola was remove d.  
Apparently he did some  other things that 
were not right and he was removed.  And we 
got a new principal, Professor Kaploski.  Some how, I couldn™t do anything wrong for 

him.  I stopped studying at all.  I sneezed, I 
got an A.  No ma tter what, you know.  It 
didn™t do me  any favor because I stopped 
studying completely on the subject he  was 

teaching us.  He taught us philosophy.  I got A 
whatever I did so kind of feel in life, got 
to give you on one hand, taking away with th
e other hand.  So whatever Bodola did for 
me , Professor Kaploski did the ki nd work. 
 Recently I found a girl
 who is the late?  
Grown woman who lives in Mineka with a lawy
er and she was one of the very few girls 
in high school who was a nice girl, it didn™t 
bother her that I was Jewish, we talked 
together.  After ma ny, many years, I picked
 up, I found her.  Maybe, I™m helping her a 
little bit.  She wrote me a letter that  she ne
ver knew that out fr iendship meant so much to 
me .  She apparently looked at me  as an ordi
nary schoolma te.  It was very important that 
some body i n those days treated me  norma lly. 
 In the winter of 1949, the Jews were 
allowed to leave for Israel.  My fami ly deci
ded to go to Israel and my parents offered 
Frania to go with us.  They promised he
r, there we re ways, with money you could 
arrange all kinds of -- an arra
ngement could be made, to tran
sfer her to Israel although 
non-Jewish people were not allowe
d to go but we could have done it.  She refused to go.  
She said, ﬁYou know I™m going to mi ss you very mu
ch but this is my country, this is my 
language, this is my religion, this is my pr
iest.  I go to church, I understand what the 
priest is saying, I belong here.ﬂ  So we left 
but we were heartbroken; we cried for mont hs, 
all of us.  We went to Israel, 
we would write the letter, it was 
very different.  In Israel, in 
1950, it was very difficult to live.  The co
lonical??  Situation wa
s very bad -- no food, 
nothing.  The country wa s very poor.  We  didn™t 
do too well.  Then my si ster got ma rried

and she passed _______. We  went to school, we 
studied, we went to the university but 
my sister we were sending Frania every cent 
we could spare, all countries from Israel.  
Some  mone y, very little, we didn™t have muc
h.  But I reme mber that one of the first 
lessons she was to give, ﬁNow that you are 
in Israel, don™t send me  any more money.  
Your husband does not know me .  It is not fairto him, he should send me  money.  I am a 

complete stranger.ﬂ  I don™t th
ink a mother could write a lette
r like that.  She was not a 
wealthy woma n, we left her provided but it wa
s years, took her years, she was on and off 
.  We  always writing to her, we always se
nd whatever we coul d.  I came to the United 

States 31 years ago but I was al
ways in touch with her, sent
 pictures, she sent pictures 
back.  We  se nt packages to her and always
 she would say, please don™t send, ma ybe your 
husband will be unhappy, ma ybe you will need 
it.  She never took advantage of our 
situation but we did help her out.  Eventual
ly she took in, she was a very loving woma n, 
she had a brother who had children and the brot
her was a poor ma n so she adopted one of 
his daughters and raised her as her own.  She 
needed some body to give love to.  About 15 
or 16 years ago, I found out that actually 
people in Gradzanowo, Poland were ma ny 
_______  _______. 

I think you know what this time that you should be
 right.  We bought a ticket, we split the 
money, my sister was in Atlant
a, Georgia that day.  We  put 
together the money, the ticket 
was quite expensive; ma ybe it was 16, 17 years 
ago, we sent the ticket.  Frania took the 
airport in Stupeka _____.  She did the airport.
  When I left Poland, I was 18 years old.  
Here I am, a woma n in my forties with my
 husband.  I see that the aged woma n, very, 
very, she was very worn out, I had never seen
 so ma ny wrinkles in my life, came out of 
the gate and I came over and I said, ﬁare you Mr
s. Kobach?ﬂ She say, yes, yes.  It looked 
like her.  And I said it is me
.  Naturally we hugged, we kissed,
 we cried.  She came to my 
house, she take tea.  I must tell you what 
a great, generous wo ma n.  She came with a 
fruitcake, there was a china set for me, one for my sister, God forbid anybody should be 
jealous.  There was a dancer?  For my daughter
, there was some  kind of t oy for my son.  
There were cufflinks for my husband, she di
dn™t have that kind of money. ________  She 
came, a gallant woma n with gifts, she cooke
d, she baked.  I took her to the church on 
Fifth Avenue.  Then she told me , you know, 
I still don™t tell my friends, my neighbors 
what I did.  She had all new neighbors and fr
iends, she lived in 
a _____  I™ll give ______  
_____ to confession.  I thought, please my G
od, where am I going and who invited me 
but otherwise nobody knows.  She was a woma n in 
her sixties at the time.  I never knew 
her age.  But she had hard luck, as I me ntioned she had started working when she was 
five years old,  I took her to a departme nt 
store and I dressed her, I bought her everything, 
shoes, stockings, dresses, coats, everyt hing 
from A to Z.  And each time , I brought her 

things, try this, try this, she™d say, please 
don™t do it, your husband ma y ge t upset.  I don™t 
want you to do it.  You have children, what 
of them.  You kee p the money for yourself.  
You have young children, you will need the mone
y.  She did not want to take a thing.  
The same thing with my sister,  She takes th
ree weeks with me  and 
three weeks with my 
sister.  She went to the church St. Pa trick™s 
a great pavilion and she said Gee the chur ch is 
bigger than all the churches put together than I 
have seen in my life.  I think this was the 
highlight of her life.  Then we asked her to 
stay with us because we
 really loved her and 
we would have taken very good care of her.  We  as
ked her to stay a time. 
      We  lived a 
quite comfortable life, nothing special, but co
mf ortable, not bad.  There would be room 
for another.  She chose not to.  She sa
ys, you know, how would I go to church?   How

would I understand what the priest ---.  I sa
id, Frania, look how ma ny churches we have 
here.  But she said, do they understand what 
the priest has to say.  How wi ll they go to 
confession?  No, it is not for me.  So she le
ft.  We  kept in touch.  She had the niece who 
would write the letters for her because sh
e could not write, she was only signing the 
letters.  And then one day, _______.  We  had the le
tter, she died.  Then we got pictures of 
her already dead, all dressed up, 
the cemetery, the grief, the eter
nity, so this 
is the end of 
a beautiful relationship.  Every year, I don™t 
know exactly the date, 
I go by the church, I 
donate money.  I am in touch with the niece.
  I send her some  money.  As a matter of 

fact, this week, I got 
a letter from her  thanking me  for th
e Christma s gift which was some  
money.  I have seen that the niece be comf
ortable and the niece opened a little business 
and she wrote a letter to me .  I opened my own 
business.  I think this and my house is all 
thanks to you.
