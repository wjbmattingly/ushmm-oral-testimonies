A: The reason I was born in 
Sav annah
,
 Georgia
 was that there was a Œ a pawn 
shop in 
Savannah
 that was operated by a Œ a Œ an elderly Jewish ma n, and he 
wanted to  have somebody take over for hi
m in the Œ you know, 
the daily duties. So 
he sent word  out to 
New York
 that he would be prepared to move a Jewish couple 
down  to 
Sav annah
 and get them lodging, if the Œ 
the man in the family would take 
over the running of the pawn sh op. And he 
interviewed my father, and he felt my 
father was qualified, and my father had 
recently been married 
to my mother, who 
came over from 
Lithuania
 to Œ I th ink she was encourag ed to co me over to meet 
my father, but I wasn™t there, so I don™
t know anything about that. Anyway , they 
did get married and go 
Œ and went down to  
Sa vanna h
, and s-so that™s where I was 
born, and my  three younger siblings were bo
rn there, too. Eventu
ally the pawn shop 
turned into a la
rge department sto re, and my father became the man ager of the 
department store. 
Q: Ah, I see. 
A: And i Œ the Œ you know, and our life in 
Savannah
 was quite interesting and 
exciting. As a young child, 
I remember adventures in 
Savannah
 that Œ that I really 
cherish. 

Q: Well, I™m going to get Œ want to explor
e some of those, but right now I™d like to 
talk a little bit more about your immedi
ate family. You antic
ipated one of my 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
5
questions, which is, did you have any sib
lings. And so you did,
 and it sounds like 
you were the oldest of the Œ of the children. 
A: Yes, I had three siblings, and I was th
e oldest, and sadly I™ve outlived them all. 
Q: Oh dear. 

A: It™s Œ some of them died fairly young.
 Two of them actually contracted illnesses 
in 
Lithuania
 during the very severe winters that  we experienced there. One of them 
had spinal meningitis, which Œ 
Q: Wow, wow. 
A: Œ did not affect his life, other than it wa
s a great shock to us to find out that Œhe 
was just a little baby Œ well, not a baby, but 
he was about two years old, or so , and Œ 
or three. And after he Œ he
 recovered from the spinal me
ningitis, we discovered that 
he could no longer hear 
anything. So he became a 
deaf mu te. But he Œ he Œ 
Q: What was his name ? 

A: 
Bernard
. 
Q: And when was he born? 

A: You know, I don™t know. 

Q: Okay . 
A: I Œ I don™t know the birthdays of anybody. 
Q: Okay. That™s okay. I ask, but if 
it Œ and if it™s there, it™s fine Œ 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ and if it™s not Œ it™s just to Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ it™s just to get a sense of Œ 
A: Yeah,, I wish I knew a ll these things, but since our
 family was pretty much 
broken up with all th
e trips back and fo rth, and my  father losing his job as Œ as a 
consequence of these interruptio ns in our liv
es, we didn™t have family affairs like 
birthday parties, and Œ and ce
lebrations. I mean, it was just get what you could get 
out of life, you know, so th
at™s why I don™t Œ I really don™t Œ I Œ I never put mu ch 
store in anyone remembering my  birthday, 
or Œ or me remembering theirs. In any 
case, he did Œ he did grow up as a deaf 
mu te, and work ed, and had a family, and had 
a Œ a reasonably successful life. My brother 
David
, the youngest, was actually 
spirited out of 
Lithuania
 as the Nazis were invading. 
Q: We™ll come to that. Right now I 
just Œ I™m sorry that I interrupt. 
A: Yes, that™s all right. 

Q: But right now what I want to get a sense o f is just who you
r family Œ the names 
of the people, a little b it about your pa
rents and so  on. So when we come to 
chronologically, let™
s say 1939, 1941 Œ 
A: Yes.

Q: Œ things like that, then we
 Œ we™ll explore some of these important parts of their 
lives. 
A: I understand. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yes. 

Q: So right now we have y
ou as the oldest, then who was the next brother in line? 
A: 
Harry
. 
Q: 
Harry
. And then Œ 
A: 
Bernard
 Œ 
Q: 
Bernard
. 
A: Œ and 
David
. 
Q: Okay , and how many years were ther
e between you? I mean, were you very 

mu ch an older brother, or were they close to you in ag e? 

A: We were approximately Œ we Œ each on
e of us was separated from the next one 
by a year and a half. 
Q: Wow, close. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Pretty close. 
A: Very close. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016

Q: Yeah. Tell me Œ 
A: And I suspect that my 
mother took us all to 
Lithuania
 so she wouldn™t become 
pregnant again. 
Q: That™s a rather drastic trip, you know, a lot of distance. 
A: Well, my father stayed in 
America
, so Œ 
Q: Yeah. Well, we™ll come to that. But le
t™s now stop with your Œ no, not stop, but 
turn to your mo ther and you
r father. Tell me your moth
er™s full name and maiden 
name, if Œ if you have it. What 
was her first n ame, and her Œ yeah. 

A: Her first name was Œ 
the English version was 
Mildred
. In Œ i-in the Œ in Jewish 
it was 
Miechla
(ph). 
Q: 
Miechla
(ph), mm-hm. 
A: Yeah, but it became 
Mildred
 in Œ in Œ in English.
 My father™s name was 
Moishe
, but which became 
Morris
, and Œ 
Q: Were they first generation immigrants to the 
United States
? Had they Œ 
A: Yes, they were. 

Q: Okay . 

A: First to general Œ first generation. 
Q: And where did your fa Œ yo
u said your mo ther came from 
Lithuania
. Wh ere did 
your father come from? 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016

A: The same town they Œ as a matter of 
fact, it was at my father™s urging that my 
mother™s sister, who was here in 
America
, negotiated to have my mother brought 
over for my father. 
Q: Oh, as a potential bride? 
A: Yes. 

Q: I see, I see. 

A: They may have had contact in 
Za r a s a i
. I™m not sure, because eventually our 
family got so separated, that with all 
the trip s and spending time first with both 
parents, then with one parent, you know, you lose a lot of Œ 

Q: Yeah, of course. It sounds like chaos. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So y Œ both parents are from 
Lithuania
, from the same town. 
A: Yes. 

Q: They™ve come over to the 
United States
, your father first. Did he have siblings, 
by th e way, your father? Did he
 come from a larger family? 
A: Yes, he came from a large family, and 
curiously, considering what I mentioned 
earlier, as just an observation, my father 
was very angry at his father, because he Œ 
his Œ his mo ther was pregnant all the tim
e, and he had a Œ a large numb er of 
siblings. So, it™s ironic in a way that I Œ 
I think that maybe my mother felt the way 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
10
he felt. But i-it wa Œ it was really not unc
o-uncommon at Œ in those days for large 
families Œ 

Q: Abso lutely. 
A: Œ to grow and grow and 
grow. And of co urse my  father loved his mo ther so 
much that she Œ she started 
to become sickly with all 
the work  attendant to having 
lots of children, that I think he felt like th
at Œ that Œ like, you know, a lot of children 
felt, that as they got more and more 
siblings, and their mo thers were being Œ 
Q :  W o rn  do wn . 
A: Œ wo rn out Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ they worried about that. 
Q: Of course. 

A: So Œ but my mother™s fam
ily, there were a lot of sibli ngs also. Some remained in 
Lithuania
, and some went to 
Russia
, and two of them Œ two of my  mo ther™s 
siblings went to 
Russia
 and became doctors. So Œ 
Q: In the tsarist times? 
During the tsarist regime? 
A: No, it was Œ it was probably the Soviet. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
11
A: Yeah, because during the tsarist regime
, everyone was fleeing, I d Œ from what 
I™ve heard, and I Œ I have no reason to kno
w whether it™s true or not. They mainly 
feared being in the tsarist milita
ry, and being sent to fight in 
Japan
, or some Œ you 
know, strange place in the world. So tha-
that was the reason why a l Œ a lot of 
young Jews took off and emigrated. So  Œ 
Q: It™s a reason I also heard. Nobody want
ed to fight in the ts
arist army, you know. 
A: That™s it. 
Q: Nobody wanted to Œ pa
rticularly as it wasn™t their home and their fight. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did your family always 
come from this part of the 
world? I mean, this is the 
[indecipherable]
 settlement, and a lot of Jews 
weren™t allowed to live in other 
places of the Russian empire. Do you know 
anything beyond th-the stories and the 
lives of your grandparents, 
of where they ca Œ their fa
milies came from, or does it 
pretty much start from there? 
A: I don™t know a-a Œ I don™t know wh ere my gran dparents came from. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I Œ the only rumors that I heard as a ch
ild was that they Œ wh
en  they could, they 
escaped to 
Lithuania
, and in fact, 
Lithuania 
is surrounded by lakes, and one of the 
thrilling stories that we cousins would talk
 about was that our various parents spent 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
12
nights in the lakes, breathing through st
raws to avoid being recaptured by the 
Russian military people who were look ing for Œ for the 
young men. So Œ 
Q: Can we cut for a second. 
[break] 
Rolling? We™re rolling.
 Okay. So Œ so 
Za r a s a i
 
was surrounded by lakes, and you heard stor
ies and rumors of some of the relatives 
staying underneath Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ breathing through straws, to not be captured. 
A: That™s Œ that Œ that™s Œ those ar
e the stories I™ve h
eard when  I was in 
Lithuania
, 
and of course to me, these were very br
ave people with  great adventures. And I was 
caught up in it, I Œ you know, as Œ 
Q: Of course, there™s great Œ they™re 
grand stories, and it™s very dramatic. 
A: Yes. And surviv al was really Œ you kn
ow, was a dail y business. Whether it was a 
shortage of food, or Œ or
 you™re being persecuted by
 one group or an other. My 
cousin 
Daniel
, who is my  age, and was very brig
ht, he was so happy ab out the fact 
that 
Japan
 defeated tsarist troops. Oh, he celeb
rated, he had little soldiers, and he 
would play the Japanese 
knocking over the Russians. 
For some reaso n , tsarist 
Russia
 was very unpopular in th
e circles that I was in Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ which was predominantly Jewish. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
13
Q: Of course. 
A: Not all Œ not a hundred percent. My
 Œ my  father figure was a Polish man. 
Q: That™s 
Za r a sa i
, yes? 
A: Pardon? 

Q: That™s when you™re in 
Za r a s a i
? 
A: When I was in 
Za r a s a i
, yes. 
Q: Hold that thought. 
A: Okay . 
Q: We™ll get there. Right now th ough, I wa
nt to find more out Œ more about your 
parents, as personalities. What kind of a 
person was your father, what kind of a 
person was your mo ther? Can 
you tell me that, can you talk to me about that? 
A: I ca Œ I can tell you as much as I know
 about my  parents, which is, considering 
our frequent separations, is limited. One thi
ng I can tell you fo r certain is that both 
my  parents had amazing senses of humor. Un
fo rtunately, they didn™t deploy it all 
the time, because they were 
in a certain Œ in certain areas of conflict. My father 
disdained the religious community, my  mo
ther embraced it. So there was a Œ 
Q: Tension. 

A: Œ there Œ and of course, when my  fath
er took me and my  brothers out on a 
weekend trolley ride to some amusement 
park, he would buy us hot dogs, and he 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
14
would say, do not tell your mo
ther. You know, these were 
not kosher hot dogs. So Œ 
but as far as humor is concerned, my  mo
ther, when  Œ when we Œ when we visited 
Lithuania
, and I met her relatives, and friends 
of hers when  she was a young girl, 
and they  would say, oh, your mo th er, the 
greatest entertainer 
in the world. She 
could mimi c people, and sh e could do skits 
about the tsar and the tsarina and Œ and 
e-everyone was rolling on th
e floor with laughter. 
Q: Is this a mo ther you knew? Did you recognize that? 
A: I Œ I Œ yes, she was very creative, and 
sh e was also very in
telligent. I mean, she 
went to night school in 
America
 as soon as she arrived, 
to learn English. And she 
became so proficient at it, that she collect
ed books, and she woul
d read to us every 
night to go Œ when we
 were going to sleep. 
Q: In English? 
A: In English. And even when we were in 
Lithuania
, ev ery day sh Œ almo st, she 
would co me to me and say, write to your 
father and tell him to send English books, 
because you need to keep up
 with your English. And sh
e constantly corrected our 
g r ammar. 

Q: Wow. 
A: I can rememb er so vividly, her look gl
aring at me and saying, who is her? You 
refer to me as your mo th er, not as her, or 
she. I mean, she Œ she was a stickler for Œ 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
15
Q: Propriety, and Œ 
A: Œ correctness. 

Q: Œ yes, yeah. 
A: And it™s Œ it™s Œ has served me well, beca
use I™ve written tons of material myself, 
and I Œ you know, I Œ I think I learned to
 sp eak properly because of her. When  I 
returned from 
Lithuania
, and they stuck me into classes that were younger than th 
Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ where the people were younger, I 
was skipped frequently, because I knew Œ I 
knew the stuff. My mother Œ 

Q: She made sure you didn™t lose the language. 
A: Abso lutely. Read w
onderful stories to us from English books. 
Q: Now, at home in 
Sav annah
, that begs this question of what was the language 
you spoke to one another in? If English wa
s something that was special, does that 
mean you spoke another language with one another? 

A: No, we spoke English en-entirely. 

Q: No Yiddish? 
A: No Yiddish whatsoev er. Wh
en  I Œ when  we landed in 
Lithuania
, it was first yi Œ 
I did hear some Yiddish. We had an Œ an
 elderly Œ not my aunt, but my mother™s 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
16
aunt, and my  mo ther would talk to her in Yiddish, and my  Aunt 
Frieda 
would talk 
to my mother in Yiddish if she didn™t wa
nt us to understand 
what she was saying. 
So I heard Yiddish. I had no id ea what it Œ 
any of Œ an ything meant, except maybe a 
few simple word s. Bu
t when I arrived in 
Lithuania
 I knew  none of it, and Œ but I 
learned to speak it fluently. 
Q: Okay. Now tell me a little 
bit about your dad. You said he also had a sense of 
humor, but he had a different
 value. He was not religious, whereas your mo th er was 
religious. 

A: Yes. 

Q: What kind of a personality did he 
have? What do you re
member from that? 
A: He Œ he was Œ I met people in 
Lithuania
 who would, when  they heard who I 
was, and they rememb er going to school w
ith my father would sa
y, oh, your father 
was the smartest guy in the classroom. He
 also was Œ he became a well-known 
calligrapher. He could write a s Œ a Spencerian
 hand, that was Œ people used to ask 
him to fill out papers for them. 

Q: Wow, mm-hm. 

A: All self-taught. And he was an av
aricious reader, but of newspapers Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ and magazines. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
17
Q: What were the newspapers in your home in 
Savannah
? What were the 
newspapers that he would read? 
A: Well, there was a local paper Œ papers, 
but I Œ I don™t rememb er the Œ the names 
of the papers. My only interest in those 
papers were the Sunday funnies, and the 
daily funnies as well. My brother 
Harry
 an d I were crazy about the cartoons, 
because we were bo-both had 
art talent. And part of the art talent w e had came from 
copying the cartoons from the newspaper st
rips, which were taught to us by our 
father. 
Q: Really? 

A: Oh yes. He would sit us
 down on a Sunday, and take 
out a large sheaf of white 
paper, and start drawing 
Jig Œ Ma ggie and Jiggs
, and 
Dick Tracy
, and all the car Œ 
cartoons of those days, and 
it was like magic to me and 
Ha rry
, and we became 
professional artists, and Œ but my
 father was very good at it.
 He Œ I think that had he 
pursu ed it as a career, he co
uld have succeeded. But Œ 
Q: But isn™t that interesting, that he bequ
eathed to you Œ in so
me ways you se Œ you 
talk about sense of humor as something 
your parents both had, his talent in 
calligraphy, and how that translates to Œ to
 kind of fostering this Œ this drawing 
talent in young boys to Œ y
ou know, copy th
e funnies out.  
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
18
Q: That these are sort of lik
e legacies in Œ in a way. 
A: Yes, they are. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Well, he Œ he was Œ he was, unfortunat
ely, a beaten man. And that took a lot out 
of him. Took a lot of the fun out of him.
 And the reason he was beaten is that, 
because of his frustration at not be
ing able to keep
 his family in 
America
, my 
mo ther was constantly taking us to 
Lithuania
, he lost his job because of that. He Œ 
the first time we went to 
Lithuania
, h-he Œ he ga Œ he ju st
 took off from his job as 
manager of a departme nt store, and spent 
months and months trying to get us to 
come back. And when he re
turned, of course the Great Depression struck, I think 
that was 1929, and his job was eliminated
. And he Œ th e only jo
b he could get was 
in the post office, because 
he had vetera
ns benefits. 
Q: He fought in World War I? 
A: He was in World War I. 
Q: Where did he fight? 
A: He was Œ he was captured by the Germ
ans, and suffered terri
bly in World War I. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: And I remember I was so fascinated w
ith World War I when I was a little b oy, 
because there was still a 
lot of talk about it Œ 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
19
Q: Of course. 
A: Œ there was a lot of Œ a lot of veterans
 around. And I would constantly say to my  
father, you know, typically, Daddy, 
tell me what you did in  the war. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And he Œ I™ll never forget his answe
r, it was always the same, I shot lions. 
Q: Oh God. 

A: I said, Daddy, you didn™t go hunting for 
lions in th e war. He says, oh, I did. The 
rest of them were shooting each other, but 
I was looking for lions. He didn™t want to 
talk about it. 

Q: Of course. 
A: I later fo und out from his brother, my Uncle 
Harry
 that he was captured by the 
Germans. And 
Germany
 was not Œ did not have the Nazi Œ 
Q: Of course. 
A: Œ anti-Semitic attitude at that time, so 
he was not mistreated as a Jew, he was di 
Œ mistreated as Œ as an Œ as an Œ not only 
as an American, but by the fact that th ere 
was not enough food fo r the German peop
le, the captive Americans were given no 
food at all. So he Œ he st
arved, and s Œ like they all did, all the captives. So, he 
didn™t want to talk about th
e war at all, but my Uncle 
Harry
 filled me in on the 
months and months and months that he lived in Œ in a 
Œ in hovels, and Œ

20
Q: Was this when you were olde
r that he filled you in on this? 
A: Yes, when I was older. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: When my father was no longer alive, he
 told me. I think my father must have 
told his brother, d-don™t Œ don™t te
ll them about Œ you know, what Œ 
Q: People want to spare th
eir children these things. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: They really do. 
A: I think so . He never wo Œ he never on
ce mentioned a single thing about the war, 
and he wo uld hide photogr
aphs of him in unifo rm. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, I Œ I Œ I foun Œ I got some sent 
to me by relatives, 
cousins of mine who 
inherited photographs from their mo thers,

father. And there he was, looking very, ve
ry  snappy in Œ in 
a doughboy uniform. I 
think I included a picture in the 
book, if I Œ but I™m not sure. 
Q: Oh. But what di Œ I mean
, in some ways, for someone who doesn™t want to talk 
about it, what a charming answ er he gave
 you, you know. I was shooting lions. And 
so you have to go on that tread Œ on th at 
thread of, no Daddy, you weren™t, it can™t 
be that way. Oh, yes I was, and Œ

A: Yeah, it wa Œ 
Q: Œ and he™s distracted you from the real question. 

A: Well, he distracted us and he ente
rtained us. He took me and my  brother 
Harry
 
to all kinds of wo nderful places, in and around 
Sa vannah
. He took us to an airport 
to see airplanes doing their st
unts. You have to remember 
that these are little Œ they 
look like model airplanes. And we were
 overjoyed. And of course, again, the 
admonition, don™t tell your mother what I 
bought for you to eat, you know, cause 
it™s not kosher. But Œ and he 
took us to merry-go-ro unds, and loop-de-loops, and 
you know, all kinds of Œ 

Q: Fun things. 
A: Œ fun things. He Œ on his day off, he 
was wonderful. By  the way, one of the 
things that was thrown at him when 
he was fired, was hi-his children™s 
destructiveness. He used to invite me and 
Harry 
Œ
 Ha rry
 and me Œ I hear my  
mo ther correcting me Œ to the toy department
 of the big departme
nt store, and give 
us leave to play with the toys. 
Q: Oh my  goodness. Oh my  goodness. 

A: Well, we broke them, and we did all ki
nds of terrible things, which my father 
told us not to worry about, 
he will pay for it. But just 
the same, they threw that up 
against Œ to my  father when  he was being let Œ let go.

Q: He sounds like a very doting father. 
A: He was. He would lie on the floor, co
pyin g those cartoons ha
lf the Sunday, you 
know, we Œ and he took us to
 the park, and in troduced  us
 to this Œ the friends he 
made in the park, and you know, h-he Œ he
 Œ and he bought us 
candies, and he did 
buy us hot dogs, cause we be
gged for it. And candied apples. You know, he wa Œ he 
was Œ he was a good daddy, and we
 loved going places with him. 
Q: So what happen
ed  at home? Was home life tens
e because yo Œ you Œ your Œ 
we™re going to come to that 
part when  you™re leaving, but did th ey get along, as far 
as you knew, your parents? 

A: They seemed to get along, but ther
e were little problems that fro m Œ from a 
child™s point of view  Œ and you have to reme
mb er that I™m six years old, five or six 
years old Œ my  mo ther would co mp lain ab
out how mu ch work  there is to do. You 
know, typical Œ you have a lot of childre
n, and you Œ you Œ yo
u™re tired, and you 
complain. 
Q: Sure. 
A: And my father would take charge, a
nd he™d hire an African American lady Œ 
where he got her, I don™t know, be Œ prob
ab ly by asking questions. He was very 
friendly towards African Americ
an people. In fact, his Œ his favorite helper in the di

Œ in the store was 
James
, whom he would send on his bicycle to pick me and 
Harry
 up and bring us to the store, on a bicy cle. 
Q: Whoa. 
A: Which my mother wasn™t crazy about
 either, but no Œ nothing bad ever 
happened , and we li Œ we li Œ we loved 
James
. But then he would send Œ probably 
he would ask someone like 
James
, do you know somebody wh
o could Œ who could 
help out in the house and clean and wash 
dishes? And then  he™d  come home and my  
mo ther would be hysterical and say that 
she mixed the milk dishes with the meat 
dishes. 
Q: Non-kosher. 
A: There are certain basic things that do 
stick with people, even if they™re not 
strictly observant. Yo u have two sets of di
shes, just the way Catholics have certain 
things. 

Q: No fish on Friday. 
A: Yeah, no fi
sh on Friday. 
Q: Yeah.

A: No meat on Friday. And you put a Œ a 
hamburger on their plate and th ey™ll Œ 
they will recoil. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And with  my  mo ther, if you put a hamb
urger on a plate that™s used for dairy 
products, she wouldn™t touch it. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So, these are centuries of
 religious practices, but th
ey™re not religious, they™re 
customs. They become cust
oms. And even  non-religio us
 people are observant of 
customs. So she would beco me hysterical an
d then say, I have to throw the dishes 
out. And my  father would argue and say, 
you can™t throw dishes out just because 
someone made a mistake. You know, and that
 Œ those are the kinds of conflicts that 
they would have. 

Q: That the children would 
hear, that you would hear. 
A: We wo uld hear it and it would be upsetting. Bu t Œ and sometimes m- my  
mother™s creativity Œ she was 
very creative Œ aside from be
ing a fi Œ an unbelievable 
mimi c, she could act out poems and Œ and th
ings like that, but she also had picked 
up notions th at Œ about bathroom habits, a
nd she decided that we mu st Œ that the 
children mu st go to  the bathroom every da
y. And the only way to guarantee that 
was to serve castor oil every day. Well, 
we rebelled against that, we wouldn™t Œ 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

we™d disappear. So, her creativity, she built a 
witch in the closet that was so real, 
and she would say, you will ta
ke your castor oil, or I™m
 putting you in the closet. 
And she™d open the door, and th
ere was this living witch. 
Q: Oh my God, oh my God. 

A: By today™s standards, this is abusiv e treatment of children. 

Q: But Œ but it Œ you™re right, it™s very creative. 

A: It was very creative. We to ok Œ we took our castor oil.  
Q: Castor oil. 
A: Yep, we did take it.  

Q: Oh my God. 
A: But she had an obsession ab
out that because even in 
Lithuania
, sh e would send 
me to some  woman in town  who was Œ ha
d a Œ a private apothecary, you know, not 
Œ not licensed by anybody, it wasn™t a 
drugstore or anything, but she made up 
potions. And one of the potions she made was a Œ a laxative. It was made from 

boiling the leaves Œ those little things
 that come down from a maple tree. 
Q: Oh, the little Œ the little Œ 
A: With two wings. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Œ 
I don™t know what they™re 
called, but I know wh at 
you™re talking about. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

A: They would float down like this. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: She would boil them, and it would turn  
into a black sludge of some kind, and 
supposedly my mother believed that that
 was a good laxative. But we wouldn™t go 
near it, witch or no witch. 

Q: So Œ well, the Œ you get older and th
e witches lose some of their power, you 
know. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: You know. 

A: But I don™t look back on
 it with bitterness. I Œ you know, I thought it Œ I Œ I 
really thought she was very inventive, and 
I Œ I kind of admired that, and it™s Œ has 
stood me in good stead all these y ears be
cause being in ventive is the name of the 
game for me. I™ve created a lot of stuff, 
physical stuff, in tellectual stuff, artistic 

stuff, and I think she imbued me with that id
ea. She inf Œ she created a lot of o-other 
things as well; a good deal
 of her own clothing. 
Q: Mm-hm, what about your clothing? 

A: I Œ I can™t recall that Œ that she speci
fically  sewed anything, she must have. But 
she did take us to specialists in 
Lithuania
 who made shoes, made shirts, made 
volekkes
(ph) and Œ

Q: Has an issue. 
A: Œ deserves what he gets. 
Q: Yeah, exactly, yeah. 
Was she a warm mo ther? 

A: She could be. At times she was very warm, especially wh en she put her arms 

around us and read us the stor
ies, or told th e stories from her experiences as a young 
girl growing up in 
Za r a s a i
. And Œ and talking about 
Œ you know, holidays were 
very, very  big time things, just 
like Christmas is for non-Jews, 
Simchas Torah
, 
which is celebrating the Torah, well it™
s a joyous holiday , wh ere you give each 
other gifts, and bags full of nuts a

Q: Okay . Tell me  a little bit about Œ now let™
s get to Œ to the part where Œ where you 
Œ you leave. I mean, w h at are the conditions 
of the first time that you leave, how did 
it happen? It sounds like from what you™ve to
ld me so far, the picture that™s been 
painted, it kind of comes out of the 
blue. Why would she want to  leave? 
Q: The reason my mother want
ed to leave, as far as I 
can understand it, was really 
very simple one. She had a father in 
Za r a s a i
. She had a sister, 
Liefa
(ph) in 
Za r a s a i
, who was married to 
Moysai
(ph) and Œ and th ey had a son, 
Danke
(ph), 
Daniel
, and Œ and she had friends that she ha
d left behind. So  she convinced my  
father that she would just like to go for a 
visit. Now of course, I wasn™t old enough 
to know Œ to  be privy to their conversation,
 did she say to him, I want to go for a 
month, or two weeks. There mu st have 
been  some kind of time limi t discussed. 
Well, all I know is, the time 
was dragged on and on and on. 
Q: When  did you leave, by the way,
 wh at year was it, do you know? 
A: 1926. 
Q: So you were four year
s old Œ five years old. 
A: I was five, yeah. 
Q: You were five. Do you remember the leaving? 
A: Oh su re.  
Q: Tell me about it. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

A: We left 
Savannah
, and got on a train,
 and arrived in 
New York City
. 
Q: Was the first time you see 
New York
? 
A: The first time I Œ I saw 
New York
. And ostensibly, we were in 
New York
, 
where the ship would be, a
nd we stayed with relatives
. And it was exciting for me, 
but also terrifying, because my  mother took 
all of us Œ well, there were four of us. 
The youngest, 
David
, must have been around six months old, I mea n , he was very Œ 
Q: A baby. 
A: Œ he was a baby. He may have still been 
nursing, for all I know, I™m sure he was. 
And I reme mb er she Œ she took us on a subway, and th e doors were opening and 
closing, and people were ge
tting on and getting o
ff, and I would Œ I remember being 
so terrified that either I™ll 
get off and sh e™ll stay on the 
train, she™ll get off and I™ll Œ 
you know, and we™ll all get lo
st. Well, I couldn™t wait to ge
t out of there, and then 
we wound up at some 
Muma™s
(ph) place, an aunt. And Œ 
and that also was kind of 
crazy, because these were not mansions. Th
ey were lit Œ tiny little apartments in Œ 
in poor neighborhoods, and all the peop
le squeezed into one
 big ro om, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And I Œ I don™t even remember if we ate 
there, or what we did, it was Œ i-it was Œ 
the Œ the experience was terrify
ing, but eventually we we
re schlepped onto a boat, 
and we Œ we left and a
rrived in Œ I believe in 
Hamburg
, 
Germany
.

Q: That would be logical. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: That would be logical, that
™s w h ere a lot of the boats Œ 
A: We were on the German 
Lloyd
 line, I know that. We arrived in Œ in 
Ha mbu r g
 Œ 
and by th e way, we had retu
rn tickets on the German 
Lloyd
 line. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Which my father, when he came over 
after a year Œ I suspect that he was 
expecting us to come back every month, because my  grandfather, I heard him 
yelling at my  mo ther, go back to your husba
nd. Are you crazy staying here with this 
whole bunch of children? Oh , they used to
 have terrible fights, because he really 
thought she had it made by going to 
America
 while they™re all stuck in 
Euro pe
. 
Q: Sure, sure. 

A: And Œ 

Q: This was a poor place. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Y-You know, it was Œ 

A: I mean, she was a 
return immigrant. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And it was just not logical, no one was doing th at. So Œ

Q: And so what was the train 
ride? Then you took a train from 
Hamburg
 into 
Lithuania
? Do you ha Œ do you have any 
memories of that train ride? 
A: I Œ I have very little Œ I think it went into 
Kaunas
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Bec Œ and the reason wh
y I think it went into 
Ka unas
 is because on the way 
home, we got on a train in 
Ka unas
 and got off in 
Hamburg
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So Œ 
Q: It had to be that way the other way too, yeah. 

A: Yeah, it had to be that way the other way. 
Q: Do you remember what
 your first impressions are when you come from the 
United States
; from 
S a vannah
, which you 
knew well; and 
New York
, which you 
had gotten ju st a glimpse of, and you co me into either 
Kaunas
 or to 
Za r a s a i
; what 
kind of image there was in your mind of
 these places that you had arrived at? 
A: Well, I Œ I Œ I really thought that I wa
s going into  pre-history. I mean, people 
were barefoot in the street, and 
we were surrounded by Œ my brother 
Harry
 and I 
were surrounded by local little
 kids who were all baref
oot and Œ and 
wearing ragged 
clothes that were patched,
 and Œ and we we
ar Œ wearing our little fl Œ Lord

we felt like clowns, you know, those little Œ  
Q: Oh God, it™s death to a little boy when ev
erybody else is dressed the other way. 
A: With a 
tam o™ shanter
 and Œ I mean Œ and Œ and Œ 
and neither shorts nor long 
pants, but something that came ju st belo
w the knee. And we Œ we felt so out of 

place. 

Q: This was 
Za r a s a i
? 
A: Pardon? 

Q: This was in 
Za r a s a i
? 
A: In 
Za r a s a i
, yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And of course we didn™t
 understand, we were surro
unded by little kids who are 
yammering away in a foreign language, and 
we didn™t know what
 they Œ the only 
thing that I understood is 
one kid said, you boxer. He 
goes like Œ you boxer. And 
then a chorus of them, yo
u boxer. And I looked at 
Harry
, I said, what is he saying? 
I didn™t understand. It was only later on 
that I found out that their hero was 
Jack 
Sharkey
, a Lithuanian boxer in 
America
 who had won th e heavyweight champion, 
and had become wealthy. The 
dream of wealth was just 
the only dream anyone had 
in those days. So Œ but also Œ

Q: Do you know if these were Œ do you kn
ow if these were Jewish kids, or these 
were Lithuanian kids Œ 
A: These were Jewish kids. 
Q: These were Jewish kids. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: We Œ we lived in the 
Œ in the Jewish sect ion Œ 
Q: Of 
Za r a s a i
. 
A: Œ o-of 
Za r a sa i
. Although, the area that we re
nted a house in was not Jewish. 
Q: Can we cut? 
[break] 
Okay, this is just to say th
at we cut the camera because 
there™s drilling outside, and unf
ortunately the noise is such
 that it will be captured, 
but we™re going to keep on going. 

A: Okay . 

Q: Okay. So you lived
 in the Œ in the Jewish section of 
Za r a s a i
, and so you 
remember these little k ids su
rrounding you when you first 
arrive, an d you couldn™t 
understand what they  were saying. 

A: That™s correct. 
Q: And how long did it ta
ke until that changed? 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
35
A: I c Œ I couldn™t be sh Œ I Œ I Œ I couldn™t 
place a time as to ho
w long it took me to 
integrate with the li Œ local language
, but it Œ for one thing, my cousin 
Da niel
, who 
was my age, grew up in
 a house with my  Aunt 
Leifa
(ph) and Uncle 
Moysai
(ph), 
where they spoke French and Englis
h in addition to knowing Yiddish. 
Q: That™s pretty Œ 
A: They did Œ they  did not speak Yiddis
h among th emselves. Of course they  knew 
it because they had to 
speak it to certain clients and pe
ople like that. So I Œ I could 
have conversations with 
Da niel
, and he would translate wh
at the kids are saying, 
and then  I would question 
Daniel
, and I wo uld say, tell me again, what does this 

mean? And he would explain it to Œ he was 
very bright, and he would explain it to 
me, and little by little I picked it up, and 
before long Œ you kn
ow, kids can learn 
things very quickly th
rough experience rather
 than by rote. And ju st having th e need 
to find out something, you le
arn the words, so you can do
 wh at you want to do. I 
learned Russian that way. 

Q: Well, that was one of my questions, is 
did they speak Russian as well, did they 
speak any Lithuanian, did they
 Œ what were the number of
 languages, what were the 
languages that they spoke? 

A: Li-Lithuanian was not sp oken within the 
family f-for whatever reason that I 
don™t know. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

36
Q: Did you hear it outside? 
A: It Œ not often. 

Q: Okay . 
A: You heard it in the post o
ffice, and you heard it in the movie house. Of course, 
Lithuanians would come in. Th-The Œ th
e land around the town was the Gentile 
area, where the Polish landowners and 
Lithuanian landowners had farms and 
orchards and things like that. J-Just like my  landlord, 
Karo wlka
(ph), he Œ he and 
his brother and sister were of Polish descen
t, but they  had a very larg e orchard, and 
a bath house, and a Œ an estate, really. An
d it was a beautiful place, they had cows, 
and provided us with milk. 
Q: Was he the person you said was your father figure? 
A: Yeah, he became a f Œ at least a big br
other. He wasn™t that much older, he was 
like Œ I remember when he went down fo
r the test to be c
onscripted into the 
Lithuanian army , so he was 21. But to Œ 
to someone who was, at that time may b e 
10, 21 is Œ is Œ 

Q: An adult. 

A: Yeah. And he would take us s-spearfishi
ng, regular fishing. 
He would Œ he Œ he 
Œ once a month it was his assignment by my
 mother to take us to our little 
bathhouse, which was a steam Œ a sauna. An
d we had great times with him, he was 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

37
Œ he was Œ he really was like a big brother 
or a father. He taught us a lot, and we 
didn™t speak Œ he di Œ he 
could not speak a word of Yi
ddish, so even by the time I 
was fluent in Yiddish, I knew en ou
gh Ru ssian. And Russian was the 
lingua franca
 
there during tsarist times. 
Q: Yes. 

A: So, whether you were Jewi
sh, Polish or whatever, ye 
Œ if you wanted to get by 
you had to speak Ru ssian. So I learne
d a lot of basic Russian, and I could 
communicate with 
Karo wlka
(ph), with 
Anna
 and 
Zi e g m u n d
(ph) very, very easily 
in Russian. 

Q: How did they come Œ how did 
they intersect with your life: 
Karowlka
(ph) and 
Anna
 and 
Zi e g m u nd
(ph), and how did you meet? Wh
at was Œ how was it that you 
got to know them? 

A: I Œ my mother was lookin
g to rent a place, and th
ey  had one big house wh ich 

they lived in, and then
 they had a little cottage next Œ 
nearby Œ next door, that they 
rented, and my mother rented it. And so
 we were on the same grounds, really. 
Q: How did she pay for this? 

A: Pardon? 
Q: How did your mo ther pay for th is? 
A: Pay for it? 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
38
Q: Yeah. 
A: Well, my father sent money regularly. 
As a matter of fact, she was constantly 
telling us to write to our father that we 
are desperate for money, that we have no 
food. And later my father told me, I wa
s sending money Œ he ha
d postal receipts 
that he showed me, about that high. He
 was sending money all the time. But she 
was also giving money away. She believed 
in the Talmudic, or Torah thing about 
Tzedakah
, which is giving to the poor. And 
whoever Œ who-whoever she found out 
about through th e synagogue or people she kn
ew, that so and so was desperately out 
of money and couldn™t survive, she would 
give them a chunk of mo ney. So I Œ I 
didn™t object to that really , except, you know, we all have the feeling of, your first 
duty is at home. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But we survived, so it 
Œ there were other people 
wh o were good to us. So  Œ 
Q: Tell me a little bit about your wider fa
mily there. You mentioned that your 
grandfather, your mother™s father, still live
d there. How did Œ wh
at was his way of Œ 
of making a living? Wh at did he do? 

A: He was loosely called an 
avokat
(ph), which is an attorney. 
Q: Okay .

A: Now, I don™t think that he
 had a formal lawyer™s education. First of all, it w as a 
big joke about getting into
 the gymn asium. You coul
d only get into  the gyna Œ 
gymnasium if you fo und a Gentile kid and got
 him in, then the two of you could get 
in. That was the rumor. 
Q: And gymn asium is Œ is
 Œ is the high school? 
A: The high school, yeah. 

Q: Okay . 
A: So going to Œ going 
to higher education was virtually impossible Œ 
Q: For a Jew? 
A: Œ for Jews, yeah. They Œ well, you kn
ow, I was too young to know th e details, 
and I would really love to know what th e restrictions were. Maybe Œ maybe they 

just couldn™t pass the test, I don™t know. Bu
t f Œ from the information I was getting, 
if you™re Jewish, you can™t get into the 
gymnasia
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Okay. So we accepted that. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And a lot of Jewish kids did not go to 
public schools, they went to cheders or 
yeshivas.

Q: And what about you wh en you were ther
e? Did you go to Œ wh ich kind of school 
did you go to? 
A: My mother sent us to a 
cheder, which I hated and I st
opped going to it, because I 
was not interested in the religious part of
 it. I mean, I must have gotten that from 

my father, but my mother wanted us to Œ 
so then she hired tu
tors, and I found the 
religious part interestin g, as long as
 it wasn™t hammered 
into our heads.  
Q: In that cheder, can you 
describe to me what it was 
that you hated about it? What 
was Œ what were the instruction like, what 
were the teachers lik
e? What were some 
of the other kids like? 

A: Well, there was a lot of hitting, you kno
w, rulers on the hands and there was a Œ 
a lot of disciplining, and since I didn™t 
understand what the discipline was for, it 
was frightening, and Œ and I 
really did Œ I hated goin
g to school. But I enjoyed 
having the tutor because my 
mother hired a Œ a very br
ight young man who not only 
went thro ugh th e Bible and made it Œ made 
the Bible stories interesting, like Noah™s 
ark and stuff like that, but he also dealt 
with science, and explained science and 
geography. I reme mb er him telling us Œ and 
I used to be able to recite all the 
Japanese islands, because he 
Œ he taught us all about 
China 
and 
Japa n
 and 
India
, 
and it was like going on a trip. It was Œ that
 was very en joyable. Bu t that was one to 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
41
one and he wasn™t threateni
ng us and telling us if we do
n™t behave we™re going to 
get hit, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So school was Œ first of all, in school, 
you had a Œ a lo  Œ a Œ a lot of unruly  kids. 
I like to believe I wasn™t one of the unrul
y ones, but the Œ the 
guy running the thing 
was Œ didn™t care about distinctions, he just 
walked around with a stick or a ruler or 
something and it was very scary. I guess I Œ 
I just didn™t like the discipline of the Œ 
the religious discipline Œ 

Q: Well, you hadn't been old en
ough to  start school in the 
United States
, had you? 
When you left at age five or six, had you 
already started any kind
 of education here 
in the 
States
?  
A: I did go to Œ I Œ I did go to something in
 school. I Œ I ke Œ I don™t want to use the 
term kindergarten. I started school in 
Savannah
, I remember that. And I remember 
being bullied by the older kids, 
and especially with my name, 
Abraham
, which, if I 
didn™t get bullied by anti-Se
mites, then I got bullied by
 confederates, you know, 
because the name 
Abraham Lincoln
 was poison in 
Savannah
. I mean, you gotta 
reme mb er, it™s al mo st
 a century ago. 
Q: So this is Œ this is still living me Œ 
in the 20s, with still 
living memory of the 
Civil War. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

42
A: Sure. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Sure. I mean wa Œ the minute I woul
d mention my name in polite company, 
people would look at me
 like Œ with daggers. 
Q: And your parents would have had no 
idea when  they  named you that it could 
have this kind of effect? 
A: No. 
Q: They™re totally from a to
tally different tradition. 
A: Yes, the Bible. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Now th Œ it happens that the southern
 people are very  Œ they ™re very Bible 
conscious, and the Œ the Œthe Old Testament and the Ne
w Testament are, I think 
revered by Christians everywhere. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: So that wasn™t the problem, but the 
association they were making Œ nobody was 
naming their child in the south, 
Abraham
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean, any mo re than after the Amer
ican Revolution, I don™t think an yone was 
calling their kid King 
George
. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
43
Q: Exactly. No 
Georges
. 
A: No 
Georges
. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 we had 
George Wash ington
, so Œ 
A: No, 
George Washin gton
 was the revolutionary . 
Q: That™s right, but we have a King
 George
 who was defeated, and we have a 
George Wa shington
, so maybe 
George 
is a neutral name, cause both of them had 
it. 
A: Well, 
George Wa shington
 had his name while he was a subject of the king of 
England
. 
Q: Abso lutely. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Abso lutely. 

A: He just didn™t change his name after defeating King 
George
. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: So anyway Œ 
Q: Right. So you experienced Œ there™s so
me thing I wanted to pick  up on. Did you 
experience, you know, anti-Se
mitism in the world of ch
ildren, wh en you were in 
Savannah
? 
A: In 
Sa vanna h
, yes, to some mi nor degree. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
44
Q: How did that express itself? 
A: No, it Œ I can™t say it was anti-Semiti
sm. M aybe from the neighborhood that I 
lived in. You know, people of 
similar interests tend to co
ngregate. It Œ people of 
color, of course, were segreg
ated by co lor. Bu t very Œ I Œ 
I Œ I remember when I mo 
Œ came back from 
Lithuania
 and moved Œ moved in  Œ my  father and I shared  a r Œ 
a room, and rented a room in the 
Bronx
. And the building I lived in, I made friends 
with a couple of Jewish kids, and they wa
rn ed  me not to go on certain streets, where 
the Italians lived, and on another street 
where the Irish lived. And it wasn™t that 
there were Œ they were Œ none of thes
e streets had a hundred percent Jews, a 
hundred percent Irish, a hundr
ed percent Italian, but th
ey were predominantly of 
one ethnic or religious gro
up. And if you Œ if I walk
ed to  school on the wrong 
street, I™d be sure to get beaten up. I 
was chased, and I found out. So then, after 
being chased, my friend 
Hilton
 said, never go on that 
street. They™ll catch you, 
they™ll Œ they™ll take your shoes, they™ll 
take everything away from you. So  I said 
okay. It was just Œ those conflic
ts go on and on. I mean, even in 
Ireland
 where they 
were all Christian and they we
re killing each other, you know. 
Q: Well, what about Œ what about 
Lithuania
? Did you also have Œ I want to make a 
comparison. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
45
A: Yes. We s Œ we stayed pretty much in
 the Jewish areas. Now, that™s not to say 
that there weren™t some Gen
tiles living in Jewish areas
, and so me Jews living in 
Gentile areas. There are people who find 
acceptance because they integrate and 
they™re not threatening, and 
they Œ they just don™t deve
lop friendships, they don™t 
eat at each other™s houses and thing Œ th
ey  don™t have coffee klatches, but they 
leave each other alone. 
They don™t hit them Œ 
Q: Pick on each other. 
A: Yeah, they don™t hit each other. So
 Œ but I knew all the areas in Œ in 
Za r a s a i
 that 
were Œ that had Jewish homes mixed in 
with non-Jewish homes, and no one was 
likely to attack me, becaus
e they knew that I would r
un to the Jewish home, and 
then it would be a wh ole big hullaballoo between grownups.  
Q: So it was a safer area. 

A: A safer area, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: We Œ you automatically Œ but I di
dn™t feel threatened anywhere. I Œ 
Ha rry
 and I 
wandered all over town, and into non-
Jewish areas. And certainly no grownup 
would ev er do anything to a child in 
Lithuania ,
 that I never even thought of it, but 

you ought to watch out for the Œ for kids 
your own age, because
 fighting was, you 
know, what kids do Œ 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
46
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ for any reason, you know, 
that they can 
think of. So Œ 
Q: When  Œ when  you came to 
Za r a s a i
, what was, if there is one thing, or two 
things, that struck you as the stran g est th
ings you™d ever seen
? Because you™d come 
from a different world. You™d come from Œ I mean, 
Savannah
 is certainly different 
than 
New York City
, but that™s the wo rld of the 
United States
, and you come to 
this one, and you™ve mentioned that it™s likebeing in pre-history, but wh at was the 
strangest thing that you saw? 
Q: The strangest thing to me in 
Za r a s a i
 on my first experience was the lack of 
automobiles. There was not a single automo
bile. In fact, when 
one would be coming 
in from 
Kovno
, that we had heard about, all the 
kids would gather 
to run after the 
car. And we used to stand behind the car 
to smell the gasolin
e from the exhaust, 
because it was such an
 unusual smell. And that struck
 me. The other thing was that 
you could find fo od on trees everywhere. A
ll you had to do was walk in a certain 
area where the apple tree was hanging over th
e street, and get a stick and hit it, and 
get an apple and eat it, or a pear, or a bunc
h of cherries. We used to go after those 
things. 
Q: Well, that sounds lovely  Œ 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
47
Q: Œ you know? That™s Œ 
A: We were constantly eating fruit of so
me kind or another. The currant bushes 
were hanging over fences 
everywhere. You could walk  
along and just with your 
hand pull off big load s of ye
llow and red, what we called 
paretsky
(ph). 
Q: Mm-hm. And Œ and what about Œ you said
 your grandfather was sort of like an 
advoka t
(ph), maybe without formal training, 
but nevertheless, that. What was Œ 
what would he do? What was he Œ 
A: He Œ he interceded on be
half of Jewish people who ne
eded to go to court about 
s-some Œ some matter. It Œ it wasn™t things
 like divorce, or Œ or suing a storekeeper. 
What it was, I think, is these people re
ceived a notice that there was a Œ some kind 
of violation. Either they le
ft their horse out in the st
reet, or who knows what? And 
my  grandfather Œ now, I never heard him 
speak Lithuanian, and I suspect that he 
really couldn™t speak Lithuanian becau
se they really were refugees from 
Russia
. 
But he did speak Ru ssian fluently, and he 
might have learned e
nough Lithuanian to 
get by, fo r all I know, I just never heard 
him speak it. So he would Œ a Œ a Jewish 
person who had received a notice that he has 
to come to the court, my grandfather 
would represent him. And as 
a large landowner in town, he
 Œ he did, he ow Œ he 
owned a Œ a very big hous
e on what would be in 
New York
 a sw Œ an entire square 
block. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016

Q: Wow. 
A: Yeah, it was a large property, fille
d with lumber that
 my unc Œ Uncle 
Moysai
(p h) was dealing in , and Œ and also po
ppy fields, and fruits and vegetables 
growing there Œ 

Q: In town? 

A: Oh, it was a fantastic garden. Fantastic. 
A nd we used to go there all the time to 
pick fruit and stuff. So he was a prominen
t landowner. How he got it, I have no 
idea. 

Q: What was his name ? 

A: 
Haim  Gordon
. 
Q: Gor Œ so is that you
r mother™s maiden name? 
A: My mother™s maiden name was 
Gordon
. 
Q: So sh e was 
Mildred Gordon
 in English, but in Œ in 
Yiddish it would have been 
Milcha
(ph)? 
A: 
Michla

Gord on

his first name, your grandfather™s? 
A: 
Haim
. 
Q: 
Haim  Gordon
. 
A: That™s 
Hyman
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And can you pain t a picture for me a
bout wh at the house looked like that he 
lived in? Was it a brick, a stone, a w
ood? How many floors, things like that. 
A: My grandfather™s house wa
s a wooden house, but very, 
very elegant. It was not 
very wide, but very, very 
long. When  I say not very  wide, it Œ it Œ I Œ my  guess 
would be, let™s see, it had 
bedrooms on each side, and then a long hallway. It might 
have been say 50 feet wide, but 
maybe a Œ a 120 feet long, so Œ 
Q: That™s large. 

A: It was very large, and made of wo
od, and it had many, many big rooms: mu sic 
room, bedrooms on both sides, a huge kitchen and a huge dining room, where my  

grandfather entertained local big shots, wh
ich is Œ was where he got his power in 
the courtroom, because he was Œ now he must
 have spoken a language Œ I™m sure he 
was fluent in Ru ssian, and probably all the big shots in 
Lithuania
 were fluent in 
Russian.

Q: Yes, they would have been. 
A: Yeah, because it was a part of 
Russia 
Œ 
Q: Right. They would have Œ 
A: Œ shor Œ you know, 
I was there in the 1920s
. Well, in 1914, it was 
Russia
. 
Q: That™s right, that™s right. 
A: So it™s not that far back. 

Q: Sure. Educated people got their degrees, their higher education at Russian 
universities. 
A: They did. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I mean, there was no un
iversity in la Œ in 
Za r a s a i
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And in
 Kovno
 there was a university, but who could travel from Œ 
Q: 
Za r a s a i  
Œ 
A: Œ 
Za r a s a i  
to Œ there were no cars. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So Œ 
Q: How did you get from 
Kovno
 to  
Za r a s a i
? So did you take 
a bus? Was there a 
bus route, or Œ 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
51
A: We took a bus. 
Q: Okay , so they did have 
bus routes at that point. 
A: They did have a bus 
that came once in a while. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Once in a while. I did have a fantastic e
xperience wher Œ all the kids did. It was 
in the winter, and the Lithuanian  air force 
Œ I™m saying this slowly, so it should sink 
in, we found out that the Lithuanian 
air force was going to land on th e lake. 
Q: So it must have been  winter, with Œ it™s frozen. 
A: Pardon? 

Q: The wi Œ lake mu st have been  frozen. 
A: The lake would freeze. They pulled out si
x foot slabs of ice from the lake in the 
wintertime. 
Q: Wow. 

A: They used to saw it, a
nd then pull it out, and put it in
 a barn, and cover it with 
straw, for it Œ later in the Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ spring, you know, to preserve butter 
and stuff like that. Well, th e air force, 
three airplanes came in  and landed on the ice.
 And all the kids and half Œ a lot of the 
grownups, we all ran out on the ice. And th
ere was some talk, what if the ice cracks, 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
52
you know, and we all go down
 into the lake. But it coul
dn™t. Th Œ I think the ice 
froze to six or eight feet. 
Q: That™s how far north it was, huh? 
A: Yeah.  
Q: Mus Œ th en it was co
ld in the wintertime. 
A: It had a nickname. 

Q: What was that? 
A: 
Lithuania
 is the 
Siberia
 of 
Lithuania 
Œ 
Za r a s a i
 is the si Œ 
Q: 
Siberia 
of 
Lithuania
. 
A: 
Siberia 
of 
Lithuania
.  
Q: Wow. 
A: Yeah, we used to kid about that, but
 it was a Œ it was a lovely little town, and 
you have to picture the town 
Œ I-I-I™ll draw a word picture.  
Q: Sure. 
A: Here is a big lake. In the middle of th
e lake is a mountain. And you cut off the 
top of the mountain, and 
you build  a town  on it. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 

A: So, in the wintertime, any road going do
wn to the lake becam
e a sledding thing. 
Q: Opportunity. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
53
A: Yeah. We would ride the sled down, out
 onto the ice, it would go out 500 feet 
out onto the ice after going dow
n the hill. It was terrific.
 And everyone had a sled. 
So Œ 
Q: You Œ going back  to your grandfather™s
 house, it sounds like a very well-to-do 
house, actually, if he had separate rooms fo
r different functions, and a large kitchen. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Now, to get a sense of, you know, th
e differences in modern ity, did it have 
electricity? 

A: No. 

Q: Did it have indoor plumbing? 
A: No. 
Q: How was it heated? 

A: I Œ it was heated by fireplaces. 

Q: Coal, do you think, or by wo od? 
A: By wood. 
Q: By wood, okay. 

A: I mean, my Uncle 
Moysai
(p h) had 2,00 logs out in th e Œ in th e big garden . No, 
they Œ th ey had plenty of 
wood. I di Œ I Œ I don™t rememb er seeing fires going in a 
lot of fireplaces. I Œ I Œ  I slept there during the winter and 
y-you climbed under 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
54
quilts this thick, and it was cold. I mean, 
if you got out of bed it was freezing. And 
you didn™t want to have 
to go outside to the outhous
e. That™s Œ that was the 
plumbing.  
Q: So, during th is time, you™re Œ you™re
 still a little boy, even though you™re the 
oldest in the family. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You™re still th Œ you know, you
™re little. Did you miss your dad? 
A: Oh su re, but you know, children are am
azingly adap table. They  Œ they can be put 
off, you know. You may not be Œ be able to
 put them off if you promised them an 
ice cream cone. They ™ll nag 
you for that ice cream cone forever. Bu t if you tell 
them, you™ll see your father in six months 
Œ you don™t even know
 wh at six mo nths 
are. 
Q: Exactly. 

A: You know, so you say, all right, so I™
ll wait, so I™ll wait. And Œ but you nagged. 
Now, don™t forget my father wrote to us
 all the time, an d we looked forward to 
those. He would write to us in a roll of 
funny papers that would be a roll like that. 
Q: So he™d send 
you funny papers. 
A: Sent. We got a notice every month or so,to come to the post office and pick  up 

this roll of funny paper. And 
Harry 
and I would like on the floor reading these 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
55
things for hours on Œ we ma
intained our English Œ our ab
ilities in English, I think 
by reading and rereading th es
e funny papers over and ov
er and over again. And 
then we would read them and transl
ate them to  our friends as well. 
Q: Well, that™s so cool. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: They get to see these, 
and Œ did they have Œ did th
ey have anything like fu nny 
papers or cartoons that were from the area, from 
Lithuania
 
[indecip herable]
 
A: Not Œ not from 
Lithuania
, but from 
Germany
 Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ there was something 
Zi e g m u n d
(ph) and 
Ignatz
 or something like that, you 
know. Little Œ little mischievous kids who we
re playing tricks 
on older people, and 
stuff. And we used to laugh h
ilariously at those. But they
 were hard to get. Only 
once in a wh ile someone who traveled came
 back and brought papers with them, 
and we were dropped off 
at my  grandfather™s hous
e, and then my cousin 
Da niel
 
would bring it to us, and they were s 
Œ they were very 
cosmopolitan so Œ 
Q: Well, it sounds that way, with
 th at many languages in the home Œ 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
56
Q: That speaks of not Œ it could be a remo te area, it could be the Siberi Œ 
Za r a s a i  
being the 
Siberia 
of 
Lithuania
, but it still means that there is a wider perspective of 
the world. 
A: Yes. 
Daniel
, we never spoke Yiddish with  hi
m, only English. Bu t his parents 
spoke English to him, as well as F rench. 
Q: And so where would they have gotten those? 

A: I cannot figure it out, they Œ they must
 have been eager beavers. Or you co uld 
chalk it up to upwardly mob
ile, you know, pretentious. 
Snobs, even, you know. I 
mean, let™s face it, if you learn a language 
Œ if you learn Chin ese and you live in a 
country there™s not a single Ch inese person,
 then it™s out of curiosity more than 
anything else, but the Œ Eng
lish and Œ and French were c
onsidered  very high class. 
And just being able to flaunt it was Œ 
Q: What about German in the 1920s? Be
cause for so many people, Jews and non-
Jews alike, 
Germany
 was the land of culture. 
A: Yes. And we saw many, many Germ
an language films in my Uncle 
Moysai™s
(ph) theater, and Œ 
Q: This is in 
Za r a s a i
, or in 
Ko vno
? 
A: In 
Za r a s a i
, and in 
Kovno
 as well. 
Q: So there was a Œ so there was a theater in Œ in 
Za r a s a i
, there was a cinema there.

A: Yeah Œ no, 
Moysai

Q: Who was your mother™s sister. Okay. 
A: Btu he was like adopted  by my  gr

grandfather. But 
Moysai

handsome guy. I mean, I used 
to look up to hi

when he showed the German films, I c

A: ﬁ
The Forwards

id, you gotta remember that my 
Yiddish speaking was up to  the age of 12,
 I Œ so I don™t have an intellectual 
connection to Yiddish, I just know basi
c Yiddish. And if you start going into  
complicated philosophical st
uff, I don™t know what it Œ what it™s about. But the

nt store, or general store? What did the 
town  square look like? I™m asking two qu
estions at the same time, my  apologies. 
A: Since I didn™t have any money, and 
shopping was also somewhat of anathema, 
I™m not aware of store Œ everything was ma de
 to order. All my shoes were made to 
order, all my shirts, my  coat. When  winter was approach ing, my  mo th er started to 

schlepp us to the Œ 

Q: Tailor™s. 
A: Œ to the tailor™s, to the 
bootmakers, to the Œ you know, to the Œ stockings. I had 
to go to a place to have stockings made. So Œ 
Q: What about bakeries? Were there bagels? 
A: There were places where you could buy
 bagels. There were also ladies who 
walked down the stre
et with strings of bagels, shouting

 That™s in 
Russian. There were bakeries, yeah, you c
ould Œ you could buy 
bread. I know we 
didn™t bake anything. And we scratched for fo od. 

Q: Were you hungry? 
A: I was hungry a lot, yeah. My  mo ther 
didn™t pay much atte

food. That™s one of the 
things where she fell d o wn

starving and she™d Œ finally she would co
me home and we figure, maybe there™s

another time Œ and I hated this Œ she bro
ught like a pound of butter, and a pound of 
white cheese, and mashed it all together,

was not fulfilling.

A: Œ I honestly don™t rememb er what food
 was about. The thing we looked  forward 
to in 
Za r a s a i
 was something called cholent. Cholen
t is a big iron pot, about the s Œ 
bigger than a basketball Œ about the size of
 a ba-basketball. A s-s-solid iron pot. 
And all kinds of stuff went into it: sliced 
carrots, peas, chicken, 
potato, even onion. 
And 
[indecipherable]
 water, and it was just a huge stew in there. Must have been  
five pounds worth of food in th ere, and 
I had to carry it to a communal oven, Friday 
before sundown. And it would be shoved 
in to a communal oven. And then Saturday 
night, after sundown, I would go pick it up and carry it for five kilometers. Oh God, 
what a chore this was. I™m not yet 12 year
s old, I™m a Œ maybe 10 or 11. And a Œ it 

Œ well, we built a wagon, 
Ha rry  
and I, and we used to pu
ll it. Someone gave us 
broken parts of yo-yos. They  were ma
king yo-yos in a mill, a wooden mill. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. And th ey would br
eak ap art, and they wouldn™
t bother putting it togeth er, 
so they gave it Œ we had a friend th ere, and he gave me a bag full of Œ  
Q: Yo-yos. 
A: Œ y-yo-yo discs. We made 
wagons out of it a

gotta tell you that when  that came home, it 
was still piping hot, because it™s Œ 

Q: The iron kept the heat. 
A: Œ an iron pot, and Œ and that stuff was boiling wh en  we picked  it up. And it 
cooled off enough to  be able
 to eat it, and it was delicious. That Œ you know, it™s a 
great stew, I mean, potatoes and carrots 
and chicken and Œ I think she put some 
honey in it too, I Œ but it was Œ it was just 
delicious. And that™s the best meal of the 
week that we had. Otherwise it was a lot of 
herring. It re Œ herring was easy to get. 
Is Œ this comes in a barrel. So we™d each
 get a herring and a piece of bread. But it™s 
not a fulfilling diet. 
Q: How Œ how did your 
mo ther spend her days? 
A: Either with friends, or she was in 
the shul, I don™t know wh ich one she was 
doing. We Œ I Œ I™m Œ I™m sure she had a lot 
of friends, or she pref Œ or took care of 
sick old people. That was part of her charity work . 
Q: But her kids na Œ it sounds like 
you were kind of ra
ising yourselves. 
A: We were raising ourselves, yes, we were. And then

™d  say, are you hungry? And we™d say yes. 
And 
Ka rowlka

me good food, but 
if you tell your 
mother, you will never, ever be able
 to eat here again. So we s Œ 
Harry 
and I would 
say, we won™t tell, we won™t 
tell. And I think we even got 
pork chops. Bu
t we didn™t 
care. 
Q: Do you remember that 
kind of food? Was it very 
different from the food you 
were used to at home? Or
 was it just, it™s a meal? 
A: Not th e chicken, very Œ chicken and 
fish, you know. You used  to go out and 
spear fish. So you get a nice big pike, abou
t that long, and that was delicious, you 
know. Had a lot of little 
Y
 bones, but you learn to spit them out. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And oh, I loved going th er
e, you know, that was great.
 And they were very sweet

ook care of the cow and the

 of stuff, and the ga

bles. And fruit galore. In fact, his orchard 
was so productive th at he would rent it 
out in the summe r to a entrepreneur who 
would co me and pick  loads of th e stuff and sell it to the stores. But we could go in

there and pick apples and pear and curra
nts and gooseberries, wonderful stuff. But 
that™s in the summertime. In
 the wintertime youhave to
 rely on slaughtering the 
chickens, and Œ I had pet chickens, too. 
Q: Did you? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did th ey have names? 

A: Hm? 
Q: Did th ey have names? 
A: They did, but I forget
. I had one favorite chicken and Œ and I thought she was 
lost. And then one day, she™s found, she marches out from under the outhouse, I 
think, I can™t know where she was. And 
she™s followed by little chicks. So I Œ I 
became a father. And I know that was very 
exciting. I really th
ought that either 
somebody had grabbed 
her and eaten her Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ or she just got lost, but she just wa
s in confinement. And 
she marched out with

Q: You know, it sounds that way. There so
unds li Œ the picture that you™re painting 
alternates b etween a place that is back
ward technologically, but has a lot of 
wonderful features to it, you know. 
A: Oh, it Œ I had a wo nderful time. We did 
Œ we did have a cert
ain amount of fear, 
because there was conflict, and it wasn™t
 Œ it™s Œ it shouldn™t be confused with 
institutional anti-Semitism, such
 as Nazism. No, it was just 
the conflicts of religious 
belief. And this goes on between Mus
lims and Hindus, between northern 
Ireland
 
and southern
 Ireland
, you know, it goes on all over the world; 
Nigeria
, you name 
it. 
Q: So you wouldn™t say if 
I Œ if I Œ it doesn™t sound like it would be mo re different 
than in other places of the world. It would 
be what you have in other places in the 
world. 

A: Abso lutely. It™s just that
 there were Œ there was tribal
ism, cliques. But tribalism 
is really what it is. Gentile kids hung out 
with Gentile kids, Jewish kids hung out 
with Jewish kids, and if the two came t
ogether, there would be co nflict. So Œ and 
then, of course, there were terrible rumors 
that were spread about Jews drinking the 
blood of Ch ristian children on Passover, you 
know. Someone starts 
a terrible story, 
and it gets passed along, because people
 Œ there are people who want to create 
trouble.

know enough ab out this, I 
would like to research it 
mo re. But, you know, sometimes
 I connect dots and I have 
to research to find out 
whether or not the co nnection is really 
valid. But the part of the world you™re 
talking ab out, which we™ve already emphasize
d, was part of the tsarist empire at 
one point. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And when the revolutionary m
ovements were happen ing in the 19
th
 century, that 
alarmed the authorities that were in power. 

A: Yes. 

Q: That there were these revolutionary 
movements. And the secret police, the 
Okhrana
, secret police Œ this is what I have 
heard, and I™d have to  research it Œ 
created The Protocol of the Elders of 
Zi o n
. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And so, if this was the place where th
is was created, and it then had a power, you 
know, it got disseminated, this
 is in those territories.

Hitler™s
 solution, and he 
was a majo r anti-Semite, and Œ beca
use he believed The Protocols of 
Zi o n
, which 
was a fabrication. 
Q: Yes, complete. 
A: Comp lete fabrication. You could do th
is with any group, you could do it with 
black people, you could do it to Irish peop
le, to a-anybody. Just pick some little Œ 
Q: Thing. 

A: Œ thing, and enlarge it into a big fair
y tale. So Œ and the Œ the spreading of 
notions like 
Christ
 killers. 
Q: That™s right, I was going to mention that
 too. So that comes from one force, and 
then you have Œ and then you have unfor
tunately, the Catholic church and other 
Christian denominations. But mostly, it woul
d have been  the Catholic church that, 
for centuries, talked 
about that, you know. 
A: Yes, well, I Œ I™m Œ I™m not well enough 
educated in these matters to Œ to take 
sides as to who the guilty pa
rty is, and who the innocen t. 
The innocent party, as we

always know, are the ones who are singled 
out for attack. They Œ no group is as 
guilty o-o-of any crime Œ first of all,
 you can™t make a g roup guilty, they™re Œ 
they™re Œ within a group, ev
en a Œ a group of bigots
, there™s somebody who says, 
wait a minute, we™re going too far with 
this. This is not Œ yo-you know Œ 
Q: That™s right. 
A: Œ this is not a human attitude. So I™m
 sure there were N
azis who had doubts 
about what they were doing, 
but you either go along, or
 you™re Œ you beco me part 
of the pariah  group. So it™s Œ it™s a Œ it™sa tu Œ it™s a tough call, but it Œ tribalism has 

been going on since the Œ si
nce time began, and it un
 Œ it undoubtedly will go on 
forever and ever. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The best we can do is learn lessons 
from these things, and try to  pass along the 
notion th at people aren™t inherently bad.
 People are born into certain circumstan ces 
beyond their ability to do anyt
hing about, you know, and Œ 
and if they become part 
of the cursed, they are in te
rrible trouble, that™s all ther
e is to it. So I think the

eating victims. We have to Œ we
 have to not do th at to any

Hitler
 if I had a chance to 
do so. I would Œ I would 
separate him from Œ from others so that he
 can™t do any more harm, but I certainly 
wouldn™t take revenge on hi
m by, you know, doing terrible 
things to him. He™s a Œ 
he was a human being as well, but Œ this is
 just my  feeling is that revenge gets you 
absolutely nothing. The only Œ th
e only terrific revenge is to educate, so that terrible 

things are l o oked upon as terr
ible things, and they turn 
everyone™s stomach, and no 
one wants to do them any mo re.

that you had to come back to th e

did come back to the

found out, 
Harry

house. So we go there, and there™s our fath
er. So our father said
, well, I™ve come to 
take you home, on and 
on and on. And I don™t Œ here my
 memory is a little shaky. I 
don™t know if he came with me and 
Ha rry
 to the house that my
 mother was renting, 
and told  her Œ or if she came to my gra
ndfather™s house. But in any case, we were 
all ordered to pack up and 
get ready to  go back home. 
Q: So that™s pretty sudden. 

A: That was very sudden. It Œ I don™t kn
ow if my  mo ther had any warning. Sh e 
probably received mail that 
said I™m Œ you Œ if you don

A: Yes, and it Œ 
Q: Tell me about that. 

A: When  he opened the suitcase, and it 
was Prohibition, I think he wanted to 
celebrate in 
New York
 with the family that we were
 staying with, relatives, and he 
went for his bottle of wine and 
it was broken in the suitcase. 
Q: Oh. 

A: I mean, during Prohibition, 
to lose such a va
luable Œ I thought I Œ he was gonna 
cry. 

Q: Poor guy. 

A: Anyway, that™s Œ 
Q: So did your mo th er not
 protest about going back ? 
A: I think there must have been a m Œ an
 ultimatum of some sort. He Œ she Œ I™m

 any case, we Œ we did come back, and Œ 
but she didn™t want to go to  
Sa vanna h
, she wanted to stay in

made him rent a house in the 
Ro ckaways

Rockaway 
beach, and becoming an American
 beachcomb er, you know. Another 
experience entirely. But my father was out 
of a job, because of this problem of Œ

A: Yeah.

Q: Œ that he had Œ he Œ becau
se he took off to get you, 
he was away from the store. 
A: Too much. And he was thr
eatened with being fired if 
he went Œ if he went off, 
and sure enough he was fired. So when he
 came back Œ however the son of the man 
who owned the department store had a bank in the Œ one of the 
Carolinas
, 
No rth 
Carolina
 or 
South Carolina
. And he offered my fath
er the opportunity  of 
operating a refreshment stand in the bank, with 
Co ca
-
Cola
 and Œ you know, 
sandwiches and stuff like that. So my  fath
er hired somebody down th ere to help 
him, and established this little business,
 from which he was ma-managing to send 
money to my mother in the 
Ro cka way s
, to pay for the house we lived in. And that 
went along smoothly fo r almo st a year, when
 she hysterically notified my father that 
I was Œ I was Œ that I was in the hospital,
 after being hit by a car. Which was true, 
but she made it sound mu ch 
worse than it really was. 
Q: Well, being hit by a car 
does sound kind of serious. 
A: Well, it was Christmastime.  
Q: What happened? 
A: And I was on the street, in ra Œ in 
Rockaways
, and across the str eet was 
Santa 
Claus
. And I wanted to run over and see 
Santa Claus
. Now, I was probably  around 
eight at this time, so I ran across and got h it by a car and was in the hospital. So my 

father came to the hospital. 
At this point, the thing in 
the bank collapsed, that he

had. That was taken away from him because
 what happened was, the man he hired 
to help him, stole everything, and moved 
it out of the bank. So
, you know, it™s like a 
soap opera. 
Q: Well, he had Œ you know, 
if he didn™t care about hi
s family, then he probably 
could have saved everyt
hing, but it Œ clearly, he cared about you Œ 
A: Oh, he did, he did. 
Q: Œ he cared about Œ and so, th at took priority. 
A: We survived the Holocaus
t because he cared. And that I can get to very  quickly. 
Q: I™d like to hear that pa
rt, yeah. We can talk about it now and th en go back  and 
fill in the gaps. 

A: All right. You mentioned that he cared 
about us. Well, here™s how he cared about 
us. In 1933, 
Hitler
 became chancellor of 
Germany
, and was going to  clean all of 
Euro pe
, if not the world, of Jews. 
Judenrein
, it was going to be. Well, my fath er 
ba Œ at that point, the only way he could 
survive after losing th
e thing in the bank, 
was to apply to the post office for a job, wh
ich, he took the test, but because he was 
a veteran of World War I, they gave him extr
a points so that he Œ he was one of the 
chosen. Otherwise, he would have
 had to wait for years in line Œ

t his Œ his ex-extra points from being a 
veteran, ma de it happen quicker. 
Q: What was his job? 
A: He was a Œ a postal car Œ not a postal 
carrier, he was a substitute postal carrier. 
He only made money when  he was sent out on a job. He sat in 
Grand Centra l 
Station
 waiting for a 59 cent an hour assign
ment. But those were Œ it was the great 
depression. This is 1933 Œ ™32 - ™33. So
 he borrowed money from Œ his father died, 
and left a little bit of money to him and 
siblings, and he bothe
r Œ borrowed some of 
the money from siblings, and he went 
over to get us, to save us from 
Hitler

whatever is gonna happen in 
Euro pe
. I don™t know th at he specifically decided that 
he was saving us from 
Hitler
, I think he was just simply 
getting very lonely after all 
these years. This seco
nd time, we were in 
Lithuania
 for four years. First time, one 
year, this time, four years. So he 
wou Œ I Œ I was Œ we were living in 
Ko vno
 at the 
time, or the Œ the suburb of 
Kov no
, called slu b  Œ
 Sluborda
(ph). 
Q: 
Slobodka
, mm-hm. 
A: 
Slobodka
. And 
Slobodka
 was essentia ll y a Jewish enclave. 
Q: Poor. Very poor. 

A: Very poor and Jewish 
and with yeshivas and syna
gogues, and later became a 
concen tration camp wh en the Germans came in.

Q: A ghetto. It became a ghetto. 
A: A Œ a ghetto. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But sort of like a concentra
tion camp. You couldn™t leave it. 
Q: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
A: So my father came and we got a notice 
from our Œ from relatives
 to Œ to come in 

and visit them. Their name was the 
Simonses
™ and they lived in 
Kovno
 proper in a 
very nice place, with a courtyard and wagon
s and horses, and very nice. So they 
used to invited us periodically, and feed 
us. And we always look
ed forward to that. 
And we had a couple of cous
ins there, too, relatives of
 my ma Œ my mother™s. So, 
we arrived there and my  cousin takes me and 
Harry
 in to another room and says, 
look who™s here. And it was my father, whom
 we hadn't  seen for three and a half 
years. Well, it was a shock. I mean, he
 embraced both of us, and it was very 
shocking. And he Œ then he told  us, he sa
id, I™ve come to take you all home, and 
let™s go and get your mo ther and the younger brothers, 
David
 and 
Berna rd
. So we 
went there, and they  had a bi
g discussion which I Œ we Œ I 
Œ we didn™t listen to, they 
held it in private. And finally they came 
out and th ey had an agreement, and the 
agreement was that he should 
take the three older boys to 
America
, and leave the 
youngest one with her, and sh
e™ll join us later. Well, I don™t think she ever had any

intention of joining us 
later, she Œ we went to 
America
 with my father, and she 
returned to 
Za r a s a i
 from 
Kovno
 fro m Œ 
Q: With your youngest brother. 
A: With my  youngest brother. And Œ and th
at™s the last we ever saw of her. 
Q: Now this is what year? 
A: 1933. May of 1933. And the reason I reme
mber that so well is that when I came 
to 
America
, I had to be put into  school in 
Œ it was May, it was sti ll school. 
Q: School time, yeah. 

A: So Œ 

Q: What about your brot
her? Did he ever Œ wh at happened to him? 
A: My youngest brother? 

Q: 
David
, mm-h m.  
A: Now we go back to my fa
ther™s caring. When Œ when 
my  father brought us back 
to 
America
, he o Œ he obviously coul
dn™t take care of us. He was a substitute postal 
carrier. He took me to
 live with him in a fu
rnished room. My Uncle 
Harry 
and  my  
Aunt 
Pauline 
in 
Brooklyn
 took my  brother 
Harry 
in . A n d  
Bernard
, the deaf mute, 
was put into the 
New York
 School for the Deaf, which he never stopped crying. 
Q: Oh, the poor fellow. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
77
A: It was so sad, because he had grown 
up with us through 
thick and thin in 
Lithuania
, and we™ll Œ had our own language. He
 didn™t know sign language or any 
of that, he knew our langua
ge. But things settled down a bit, and throughout my 
school days, every Friday I went to  the 
New York
 School for the Deaf to pick 
Bernard 
up and brin g him, and we all slept in one double bed, my  father,
 Bernard
 
and I, in a furnished room. And then on Mond
ay he had to be Œ 
no, Sunday night he 
had to be taken back to the 
New York 
School for the Deaf. And that™s how we 
lived. But now going back
 to my father™s caring. He to
ok care of all of us. He did. 
He checked on 
Ha rry
, who was living with my Œ hi
s brother, and he Œ for th e 
su mmer h e sen t  me to  l i
ve with his sister s in 
South Fallsburg
, and it was a 
wonderful treat for me, because 
South Fallsburg
 was as close as to 
Za r a s a i
 as you 
could get, surrounded 
by rivers and lakes. 
Q: Where is it? What state is it in? 
A: It™s in new Œ upper Œ 
Q: Oh, it™s up near Œ 
A: Œ in the 
Catskills
. 
Q: I see, okay. 
A: 
Catskill
 mountains. 
Q: That™s why I didn™t recognize it, yeah. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

78
A: Yes, 
Catskill
 mountains. We had rivers and la
kes and fishing, and everything 
that I had in 
Lithuania
. And I had cousins, and I di
d everything with them. And 
then, much later on, in
 s Œ when  the war was already starting, and Œ 
Q: 1939? 
A: 1939. My father made arrangement
s for a young Polish man, who was 
emigrating to the 
United Sta tes
 Œ he mu st have done th is through 
HIAS
, or one of 
the Hebrew organizations, or Jewish or
ganiza Œ I think it mu st have been 
HIAS
, but 
I™m guessing. He arranged for this 
young Polish man, on his way to 
America
, to st 
Œ to go to 
Za r a s a i
, and to go to the address where 
my mother was living with ber Œ 
with 
Dav i d
, and tell 
David
 that he has tickets for them to go to 
America
. And I 
guessed they  mu st have discussed the fact th
at if he told his mother, she wouldn™t 
let him go. He was 14. So they  kept th
e secret, and he wo
und up on a train to 
Memel
.  
Q: 
Klaip
¡
da
, yeah, the port city. Th e port city, mm-hm. 
A: No, first they Œ they Œ they w
ound up first in Œ in a Dutch city. 
Q: Oh, th en it wouldn™t be 
Memel
, that would be further west. 
Memel
 is what Œ in 
1939, March 1939, it had been part of 
Lithuania
 and then 
Hitler
 took it back , right 
after 
Czechoslovakia
 Œ 
A: Right.

Q: Œ he to ok it back. 
A: It wasn™t 
Memel
, it was Œ it Œ it was a Dutch city. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And the reason that I re Œ now remember
 that it was a Dutch city, is when the Œ 
this Polish young man and my  
brother went to the hotel to
 Œ to a hotel, to stay til 
their boat left in 
Antwerp
, they were told n-no Jews. 
By that time th e Fifth Column 
of 
Germany
 had already invaded the low co untries of 
Holland
 and Œ 
Q: 
Belgium
 and Œ 
A: 
Belgium
 and 
Holland
. And th ey couldn™t find a place 
to stay, so they made their 
way to th e port city, and ju st went looking for the Œ their Œ 

Q: Could it have Œ co uld 
Hoek
 
von Haven
 Œ could it be Œ there™s a Œ a town  called 
Hoek
 
von Haven
 or something like that. 
A: I don™t know the details, but I Œ I do re
memb er one fact that Œ that I think may 
stir something in your mind. They were ona train from the Dutch city that they had 

landed in , they needed a train to go to wh
ere the boat was. When
 they got on the 
train Œ and I don™t know where the train 
was going, but it was 
filled with German 
soldiers, and my  brother told us that he
 started speaking Yiddish, which he was 

fluent in, to the German soldiers, and they 
shared their lunch with  him, and with the 
Polish fellow. They thought he 
was speaking some kind of Œ 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

80
Q: German dialect. 
A: Œ germ Œ German dialect. And they 
all got along sw immingly, and th ey safely 
got off the train to where they
 were going to catch the boat, and even tually th ey did 
Œ they mu st have had to  go to 
Eng l and
 though, to get on a bo
at, because they came 
over on Œ my  father had ticke
ts for them on the German 
Lloyd
 line, but they 
couldn™t be used, so they had to go on 
a different boat. Now, we were switched Œ 
originally we were switche
d from a German boat to the 
Gripsholm
, which was a 
Swedish boat. But I don™t know what Œ 

Q: That was in 1933. 

A: In 1933. 
Q: And would have that been for political 
reasons, because the Nazis were in power 
by then Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ and they weren™
t going to  take Jews. 
A: They weren™t going to take Jews on their German
 Lloyd
 line boats. 
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: So we sw Œ we switched to the 
Gripsholm
. 
Q: Okay .

A: And that was a wonderful 
trip, wonderful. And Œ but no
w, my memory is sort of 
Œ none of this was written down, so my memory is getting a little shaky with my 
brother™s experiences. I reme mb er he told us
 all about this, but that was in 1940, or 
1939, 1940. I can™t even remember Œ 

Q: And 75 years later we
™re asking you details. 
A: I Œ I Œ the 
Rotterdam
, I think he was on. 
Q: Ah, okay. 
A: I think it was the 
Rotterdam
. But he Œ he and the Polish 
guide were Œ just barely 
got onto it. They  arrived late, they bare
ly got on, and so he arrived here, and 
unfortunately he brought Œ he brought his Œ 
the Lithuanian winter with him, in the 
form of rheumatic fever Œ 
Q: Oh. 

A: Œ wh ich he contracted in 
Za r a s a i
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: That™s why earlier I said, two of my br
others got sicknesses from winter, that™s 
all, it™s Œ and Œ and Œ 
Q: They™re cold winters and th
ey™re damp winters. And it Œ 
A: Damp and cold, yeah. 

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: Everybody was a lit tle sick. You know, you
 just couldn™t get 
enough heat in the 
houses. 
Q: You know, but it really doe
s speak to the extraordin ary devotion your father had. 
For somebody who was earning a living as a 
substitute postal carrier, to Œ to care 
and borro w and Œ you know, hi
s own career, such as it would have been, was kind 
of shattered. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But to care to that exte
nt, that even if he had noth
ing, he was going to  get his 
kids out. 
A: Oh, he gave us everything.
 He Œ he even  ev entu ally 
got a Œ he was still in the 
post office, he™d never le Œ ne
ver got out of the post office,
 but he did take the test 
to become a regular, so he had a regular sa
lary, not just a pick-up salary. Cause he 
was a temp  really, before. So now he was 
Œ had a regular salary, and he got a small 
apartment, it was a Œ a one bedroom apartm
ent, but we used the living room as a 
bedroom also. And he Œ he installed me in
to that apartment, and of course, every 
Friday I™d pick 
Bernard 
up and brought him to that ap
artment. And Œ and then later 
on 
David
 arrived, so he Œ he ministered to all of us. He didn™t let a single one of us 
down . And when  
David
 was in the hospital with hi
s rheumatic fever bouts, my 
father was there all day long. Certainly on
 his day off. And on 
his work days he 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

83
came up as soon as he could, skipping dinne
r and just going straight to the hospital. 
No, he was Œ he was a devoted father. Th ere™s a lot he couldn™t do fo r us, but I™ll 
even tell you this little anecdot
e: I had Œ I had to cut cl
ass in the high school in 
mu sic and art, a class that went on beyond
 the school day, which required us to go 
to a mu seum, a art mu seum, and I cut it, and I went to pick up my  brother 
Bernard
, 
brought him home. Subsequently, I was call
ed down to the dean™s office, and was 
reprimanded, and I explained why, and th
e dean was sympathetic, but she sent a 
note home to my father that I™d Œ it was her 
duty to report that I had cut a class. And 
my  father gave me a note to take back to
 her. And she called Œ and I met with her, 
and I sat with her and she opened the letter 
that my father sent, and it said, how do I 
know wh ere he was? You see him mo re ofte
n than I do. Bu t he Œ he was going to  
ride herd on me, you know? It™s Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And Œ no, it was at that point that I 
explained to her what it was all about, not 
before. I said, well, Mrs. 
Dorkin
(ph), let me tell you why I cut the class. I have a 
deaf mu te brother who is waiting at the gate 
for me to arrive, cause he is dying to  be 

with us, and I can™t Œ 
Q: Leave him there. 
A: Œ be late for him.

Q: Yeah. 
A: And she said, don™t worry about it, neve
r happen again. You don™t have to ever 
worry. So, you know, 
it™s like a soap opera. 
Q: Well, it™s Œ it™s Œ 

A: But it™s real life. 

Q: Yeah, it™s real life, and wh
en  you hear of Œ this is al
so real love, you know? It™s 
real devotion. It is when you sacrifice 
because they™re your kids, and they co me 
first. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And Œ 
A: My father did that with wh atever means he had. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And sometimes he had no means at all,
 and he borrowed money, and hopefully 

he repaid it, and I™m sure know
ing him, he would have. So Œ 
Q: I mean, tha Œ I thi Œ I™m very
 touched by it. I really am. 
A: Yeah, well, when I think 
about it, I sometimes think, 
Pop, I wish you were here, 
just so I could show you what I™ve done. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, that Œ I™m Œ that 
I™ve Œ I™ve followed your principles.

Q: Yeah. And that what he first Œ with Œ w
ith the Œ with the funn
ies, you know, that 
it started with the funnies th
at he introduced  you to? 
A: The funnies, the people in the 
funnies became part of our family. 
Maggie
 
and
 
Jiggs
, and th e 
Katzenjammer Kids
 Œ we identified with the 
Katzenjammer Kids
, 
but the 
Maggie and
 
Jiggs
 were real weirdos to us, because she was always 
throwing a rolling pin at 
Jiggs
, which I couldn™t understa
nd. It would have killed 
him. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But no, it Œ it™s Œ he created Œ he Œ he di
d create in us, a desire to be something, 
succeed at something, to fo
llow our hearts and our Œ 
our imaginations and our 
creative impulses. He had them, but he had to
 subdue them in order to be loyal to 
us, and take care of us. He never let us 
down. I can™t rememb er him ever letting me 
down . 

Q: That™s amazing. And that™s a wonderful tr
ibute. It™s just Œ it™s just a wonderful 
tribute. 

A: And we had our argument
s, and we Œ I was Œ at tim
es you can™t help Œ wh en 
you™re a callow youth, you ca
n™t help be a ca Œ but be a callow youth. And I would 
Œ I would say things to him 
like, you won™t let me have that white sweater, so I can 
wear, you know, the letter that I won in ba
sketball. And he™d say, get a job after 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

school and get yourself a sweater. And I sa
id, the other kids parents pay fo r these 
things, and then we
™d get into a Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ squabble over it. But I, of course, with 
the benefit of time, I 
realize that he had 
enough on his plate that he just couldn™t ca
rry off everything. He Œ lo oking back, he 
did mo re, I think, than mo st people would 
ever do. A majority of people would not 
Œ they would have given up. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: They mu Œ they 
Œ even good people would have 
said, I can™t Œ I can™t handle 

this. I can™t raise four little boys by mysel
f, and take care of all their needs. I don™t 
know that I could have done that. 

Q: And first of all pull them out of 
Europe
. He pulls you all out of 
Europe
. 
A: He pulled us out of the Holocaust. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I mean, you know, when  he came ove
r, people were not able to escape the 
Holo caust by th en. 1933 was a 
rough time in many parts of 
Euro pe
. I mean, he was 
a bit prescient.  

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
87
A: I mean, he beat Œ he beat the Œ the sy
stem, because it wasn™t
, I think, until 1936 
that things started to get really bad. 
Q: Well, in 
Germany
, it was, of course, some people i-i-in 
Germany
, as Œ as you 
probably well know, the depar Œ the de 
Œ the Œ amongst Jewish families, the 
question of to leave, to stay, should we le
ave, can we ride this out? If we leave now 
will Œ what will we lose? You know, all of that. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Some people left earlier, some people left
 later, some people le
ft in 1940, almost 
unheard of. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But Œ but this Œ this whole qu
estion became very relevant after 
Hitler
 came to 
power, and from other countries, like 
Lithuania
, it was Œ it were Œ other Œ there 
were other issues Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ that came up. But it was Œ then, it wo
uld have been Œ you
 know, when I™ve 
interviewed people who were
 Œ it would have been 1940 
Œ 1941, that™s when the 
cutoff is, you know, that you can™t leave,
 because the Germans have come in. 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
88
Q: And before Œ so, but let™s go back to 
Œ let™s go back to yo
ur mo ther. When you 
leave in 1933 to  go back with your fa
ther, is that the last time you saw her? 
A: That is the last time  I ever saw my  
mo ther. We did get a 
couple of pieces of 
mail, and very warm, loving letters plea
ding with us not to forget her. Very 
touching. 
Q: Any explanation? Was a
ny explanation ever given to
 you why she did not come 
to the 
United States
 again? Why she stayed? 
A: None that I know of. I have never hear
d any explan ation. The Œ th e counterpoint 
to what we were talking about, my father™s
 loyalty, and his dedication to  saving his 
children, the counterpoint to 
that Œ to that puzzle is my 
mother not seeming to care. 
I mean, you would think th
at she would have rushed
 Œ she would have written 
letters to my father Œ she could have 
communicated, there was no question about it 
Œ and saying get me out of here, I want to see my  children. No w, the Œ the only 

thing I can conclude is that there must ha
ve been some kind of mental breakdown, 
which would be understandable,
 certainly in the co Œ in  the context of her letting her 
husband take three children away , and even tu
ally losing the fourth
 one as well. So, I 
could see a Œ a breakdown, but I have no Œ I 
tried, through the Red Cross to Œ to  Œ I 
wrote to the Red Cross and asked them if
 they had any kind 
of way of tracing 
someone in 
Lithuania
, and the answer I got was basically that while the Germans 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
89
kept meticulous records of everything, wh
ich is typically Germ
an, the Lithuanians 
did not keep records at all,
 she s Œ they said. So I di
dn™t turn to 
the Holocaust 
Museum, I thought about it many times. But I wonder if the Holocaust Museum 
might have a record of
 what happened in 
Za r a s a i
, and Œ 
Q: Oh, what happened in 
Za r a s a i
, we probably do, and we
 will see h o  Œ what we 
could supply. But for this interview, it is 
that you™ve never f
ound out. Is that Œ 
A: I never found out anything. 

Q: So, do y Œ and was it a handful of 
letters y ou got sinc
e 1933? You know, 
between the time she could write, until the 
time she could not write any more? Was 
it once a month, like you said Œ 

A: No Œ 
Q: Œ your father would send you something once a mo nth wh en you were in 

Za r a s a i
. 
A: I Œ I don™t recall getting Œ I Œ I think we 
got one Œ one thing that Œ there™s a little 
bit of a mystery here. When my book was 
being done, I Œ I received a package from 
my cousin in the 
Catskills
 with Œ whose fami ly I had lived wh en I was a bo Œ a 
little boy, and 
Bernie
 sent me a package that his pa
rents had left behind when  they 
died. And one of them contained a whole 
bunch of photographs of my  mo ther and 
father, including my father in uniform. Th
ese were things that ma Œ apparently 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
90
wound up in my father™s sister™s hands. A
nd th ere was also a picture of my  mo ther, 
and written on the picture wa Œ back
 of the picture was Œ it was in 
Lithuania
, and it 
says, do not forget me. That was where 
that came from. So there were mix Œ a 
mixture of Œ of artifacts, but I have no dire
ct mail, nothing th at I can recall that she 
wrote directly to us. She might have writte
n to my father, she might have written to 
her sister, or other people, but I have nothing. I don™t recall anything. 

Q: It™s quite a gap. It™s quite a gap, you know. 
A: It is a gap there. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. And you™d think something woul
d have happened after she lost my  
youngest brother, wh en he wa
s wi Œ wh isked away by Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ this fellow who brought him to 
America
. No, it™s all a mystery. 
Q: Did you think ab out it mu ch over the years? 
A: Yeah, I think about it periodically. It
™s Œ it™s unfinished Œ it™s unfin ished, 
important in Œ life story. Bu t you know, ou
r defenses rise up. You Œ in order to 
survive, you can™t dwell on 
Œ on horror of th e past, or 
a-any Œ anything. You just 
have to move on. And so, that
™s been my defense, I Œ I just move on. Fortunately, 
my father didn™t have that attitude.

Q: Well, you know, it sounds to me like you 
lost your mo ther mo
re than one time. 
You lost her in a very personal way, as a 
family, as a mother, a
nd then you lost her 
because there was the Holocaust. 
A: Yes. I had heard that, lik
e in all the countries of 
Europe
, and th at includes 
Italy
 
and 
Spain
 and 
Bulgaria
; and you just name them all: 
Hungary
, 
Ro ma nia
, they all 
had local Nazi sympathizers. And so the Œ 
the story I heard was, once the Germans 
came in, ev en in a small group, and empo
wered the local se Œ sympathizers, they 
had people joining their group, local bi
gots, anti-Semites, or what have you, 
opportunists, and they ju
st did what the Germans wanted them to do. 
Q: It did happen. 

A: That happened. 
Q: That happened. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Now, had you heard about that in general,
 or about your mo the
r™s pi Œ situation, 
or 
Za r a s a i
 in particular. 
A: In sizi Œ yes, I heard about 
Za r a s a i
. I can™t remember fr 
Œ exactly from whom, 
but the th ing that I heard about 
Za r a s a i
 was the main road ou
t of town was cut off, 
so that the Jews were trapped with no Œ 

Q: In the town, mm-hm.

A: Œ in 
Za r a s a i
, with nowhere to
 go. And th en they were all rounded up and taken 
to the woods that I loved, where I us
ed to get my  fishing poles, and pick 
strawberries, the little ones. 
Q: They™re delicious. 
A: They™re wonderful, the little, tiny things. And we used
 to get baskets full of 
them. And well la Œ you know, it was like 
Huckleberry Finn
, I™m te Œ I™m telling 
you, 
To m Sa wy er
. And we lived the good life wh
en Œ you know, wh en we were 
able to go to these things. 
So th-the story is that they  cut off the ex
it from town on 
the main road, and then rounded them up 
and took them to 
the woods and killed 
them. And this di Œ not only happened in 
Lithuania
, it happened in 
Poland
, it 
happened  in  
Hungary
, 
Romania
, 
Yugoslavia
, every Œ you know, everywhere. It™s 
a strange kind of opportunism
 to curry favor by killing 
people, but that™s what 
people did.  

Q: There™s some things th
at we try to find answers for, and so metimes we find 
partial answers, but some parts of 
those always remain inexplicable. 
A: Inexplicable is 
the correct answer. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, because we just don™t expect human
 beings to behave in an inhuman way, 
and Œ but they do, oth Œ if they didn™
t, we wouldn™t have any mo re wars. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee

Q: Well, you know, this is one of the re
asons why earlier, when we were talking 
about relations between Jews
 and non-Jews, and whatev er
 your personal experience 
might have been in 
Za r a s a i
, I wanted to get a sense of
 how you viewed wh atev er 
was going on th ere, in the contex
t of other places, because if Œ if the message is that 
this was just as normal, you had a normal kind
 of life there, as there could be in any 
other place, that means that Œ that means 
a very spooky thing. That means that you 
put the right kind of forces together, a
nd these things can happen an ywhere. They 
didn™t ha Œ genocide didn™t happen  everyw
here. It happened in particular places, 
within a hor Œ historical context,
 when there was a final solution. 

A: Yes. 
Q: But it™s the ingredie nts in the cauldron. 
A: Yeah. I think self-preservation is a c
onsuming mo tivation, be
cause you either Œ 
the thinking among certain people who are 
very scared of everything, if you don™t 
join them, you become the vic
tims. You Œ your choice is to
 join the bad guys, or die 
as the good guy. 

Q: Oftentimes, that is 
how people saw things.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Oftentimes Œ is that a full answer? 
A: No. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
94
Q: I still think that there is Œ 
A: Well, I just can™t picture being with 
a large armed Jewish group, out to have 
sport by killing Gypsies, or some other 
unfavored Œ black people, you know. I Œ I 
just can™t picture even ente
rtaining such a notion, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s so preposterous. 
And yet, there are people who get down to  
where they say to themselves, if Œ if I 
don™t join that gang, the gang is gonna k
ill me, so I better join 
the gang. That™s how 
gangs recruit people, 
they threaten them. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And I think it would be very easy to
 threaten a non-educated farmer in 
Lithuania
 and tell him, if you don™t get rid of
 the Jews in the next farm, we™re 
gonna burn your farm down , you k
now. So what are you going to do? 

Q: Well, you know, that™s how Œ wh at the 
Œ that™s what we do wh en  we don™t know 
Œ we suppose. We suppose. And it could 
very well have been this, it could have 
been, I want his cow, I want hi
s Œ the one car that™s in town. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It could be Œ 

A: It Œ 
Q: Œ it could be Œ 
A: It could be any numb er of thin gs.

Q: It could be any numb er of thin gs Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ but there is something different when
 a war comes on when  Œ when  you have a 
force that, you know, an occ
upying power that has this po
licy. And so what do they 
do in  order to convin ce you to take part
 in somebody else™s 
repression and Œ and 
annihilation? You know, how do 
you Œ how do you explain that? 
A: It™s 
Schadenfreude
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Thank God it™s not me they™re after, you 
know. It takes a lot of courag e to stand 
up with the persecuted and sa
y, you want to do th ings 
to them, you do th em to me, 
too.  

Q: Oh yeah. 

A: You know. So Œ but it™s Œ it™s Œ cour
age is not an easy thing to  come by. 
Q: No. 
A: And I don™t claim to have any of it. 
Q: Well, we don™t know what we™d be lik
e in Œ in any sit Œ I mean, unless you™re 
tested, you don™t know how you™d react. 
A: You don™t Œ you really don™t know. An
d that™s why I appreciate the Holocaust 
Museum™s efforts so much, is that it™
s not Œ in my  view, it™s not so mu ch

remembering the fallen as to hold a mirror 
up to humanity and say, you want to be 
like these people, you want a world that Œ 
like that to live in? It™s Œ it™s horrible. 
Let™s not ever allow this to happen again.
 And course it can Œ you know, of course 
today it™s Jews, tomo rrow it™s black people, 
the day after it™s Chinese people. It Œ 
it™s always a Œ 
Q: Take your pick. 

A: Œ you can pick a victim anywhere you 
look. But no, we™re all part of the same 
race, we™re human beings and 
we need to treat each other that way. Of course, I™m 
only, you know, sounding off 
about something that™s Œ ev
eryone knows is a basic 
truism. But it bears rep eating. I mean, I™m 
not ashamed that I repeat my self with 
these kinds of things. Yes, we™re all in it t
ogether. It™s o n e world, we™re all brothers, 
we™re all eating Œ eating and 
drin king and Œ and trying to
 preserve things for our 
children and grandchildren an
d great-grandchild
ren and the millions of others who 
are yet to come. And hopefu lly, by example,
 we can Œ by doing something about it, 
by at least talking ab out things, showing 
how bad things are not to be Œ that 
shouldn™t be repeated, perh
aps someday it™ll happen, that
 people will no longer hate 
each other. 

Q: Well, the point Œ I think also, if 
we don™t do it, it will be a lot worse. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
97
A: Yes, it will be a lot worse, because 
the world is becoming 
more crowded, and 
there™s less of it, because 
of climate change, which is 
encroaching on the lowlands. 
Islands are disappearing slowly , contin
ents are shrinking and populations are 
growing, and fo od sources are becoming le
ss abundant. And so we™re either gonna 
have to get along together, 
or perish togeth er, eventua
lly. I mean, I k n ow a lot of 
people say I won™t live long enough to 
see the horro rs of Œ o-o-of Œ of global 
warming. And in my case that
™s certainly true, I Œ I me
an, I don™t have to worry 
about it happening in the next 25 years, 
because I™m not going to be here in 25 
years. But my great-grandchildren, whom I 
love dearly, will be here in 25 years, 
and I want them to have a future, as I 
want everybody™s children an d grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren to have. So  that™s
 wh Œ that™s why we Œ we talk about 
reme mb erin g . 
Q: Thank you, thank you. 

A: You™re welcome. 
Q: I couldn™t have thought of a better way 
to conclude our interview today than that. 
I really, really appreciate it. 
A: Thank you,

Q: You™re welcome. And I™ll say with this, that concludes the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum™s 
interview with Mr. 
Al Jaffee
, on May 21
st
, 2016, 
in 
Manhattan
,
 New York
. Thanks again. 
A: Thank you. 
[break] 
Q: Okay, so we started talking about a few 
things off camera, that I really asked if 
we would be able to repeat on camera. So 
this is going to be an accretion to the 
interview with Mr. 
Al Jaffee
 on May 21
st
, by the 
U
.
S
.
 Holocaust Museum
, and we 
were talking about Œ about legacies in so
me ways, so if you could Œ if you could 
give me a sense of what is it 
that you got from having lived in 
Za r a s a i
 that you 
couldn™t have here, and wh at is it that yo
u got from here that you couldn™t have 
there? 

A: Oh, what an interesting 
question. I can quickly tell you wh at I brought from here 
to 
Za r a s a i
, and how Œ how it helped me integrat
e into s Œ z Œ the children™s society 
of 
Za r a s a i
. First of all, most of the little guys that I met in 
Za r a s a i
 had never seen a 
train, a plane. They have s
een maybe one or two auto mobile
s in their lifetime so far: 
they were six or seven years old. But there™
s Œ there™s so much that never arrived in 

Za r a s a i
 for them. And I would regale them wi
th stories about subway trains that 
arrive every five minutes 
and 2,000 people shove thei
r way in, and go to work. 
Q: The ones that te
rrified you so  much. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
99
A: Yes, the one that terrified me. And Œ 
but they Œ you know, their mouths would 
hang open , and they  would ask questions: ho
w fast does this train go, and is it above 
the ground? And I said, well, some of them
 are above ground; they ™re known as the 
elevated tracks, and some 
are subways, they go unde
rg round. And there™s a new 
train every 10 - 15 minutes. And the kids
 would say to me, how many trains are 
there? And I would say oh, there are Œ they 
go around the whole city, and it™s just a 
continuous train tr Œ bunch 
of trains every 10 - 15 minutes. And I would tell them 
about trips I had taken in buses and cars a
nd with my father. And air Œ airplanes that 
we watched take off and land. And they Œ th
ey were staggered with Œ with curiosity. 
And Œ but then, I learned a lot from them. 
I learned how to Œ I Œ I didn™t know how 
to swim, so I learned how to  make swimming Œ wh at do you call a Œ 
Q: A raft of some kind? 

A: Thing that you lie down  on that su
pports you in  the 
water, and you Œ you 
practice swimming. 
Q: Oh well, it™s not a raft then, but I know wh at you mean Œ 
A: Water wings, or something like that. 

Q: Yeah, something like that, mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016

A: Anyway, I learned how to make so many things. We made our own toys, we 
made our own wagons, we made
 our own sleds. We Œ we Œ 
[phone ringing] 
[break] 
Q: So, you said you lear
ned how to make things. 
A: The Œ I learned a lot of how you Œ in 
Za r a s a i
 you didn™t have 
Woolwo rth™s
 and 
other stores that you coul
d go in  and buy whatever 
device you needed. If you 
needed  a device, you either made it, or 
you went without. And the way to find out 
how to make it was to consu
lt the local people. My friend 
Ka ro wlka
(ph) taught me 
a lot of things; how to Œ ho
w Œ how to Œ I™ll give you an  example of something Œ to 
go fishing was a Œ a very interesting occ 
Œ pri Œ you know, bus
iness for us, and Œ 
because the town was surrounded by lakes. Bu
t you need a fishing pole. Well, that™s 
very easy. You go to th e local woods, and 
you find a sapling that™s just the right 
length and th e right size, and you cut it down,
 and that™s your fishing pole. Now you 
need fishing line. Well, you can™t use just
 anything. But there are white horses, and 
white horses have long, white tails, and 
you just pull out a few strands here and 

there, and you braid them, and it turns into the Œ a-and then you Œ you have like a Œ 

maybe a two or three foot length, and you 
get about six or seven of those, and now 
you have a terrific fish ing line. The Œ the 
bobber is simple, a goose quill and a cork, 
and you put a hole in the co
rk and you put the goose qu
ill through it, and then you 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
101
run your line through it. The 
only think you have to buy
 is the fish hook. Nobody 
knows how to make a fish hook. And th e st
ore always has fish hooks. So we went 
fishing all the time with these things, and we
 caught the fish, we fried the fish and 
we ate the fish and we had a wonderful tim
e. But we also Œ you could buy sleds in 
the wintertime, but my  brother 
Harry 
and I loved to play Œ pl
ay with wood, and we 
would make our own sleds, they were simp
le things, but Œ but we di Œ we didn™t 
bother wi Œ sl-sleds were rea
lly so cheap that we were ab
le to get a few pennies to 
buy sleds. But we made our ice skates. 
Q: You made your own ice skates? 

A: We made our own ice skates because all it took was le-leather straps, a piece of 
wood, and then you go to th
e local blacksmith and he pu
ts a little strip of iron 
underneath as Œ as a runner. And you put the 
straps Œ nail the straps to the piece of 
wood, and you put it on your fe
et. It worked. I mean, we we
nt ice skating with these 
things and had a wonderful time. So, we le
arned how Œ we learne
d how to swim, we 
learned how to ice skate, we learned how 
Œ how to catch fish. In the wintertime we 
got Œ we got sp Œ poles that were simila
r to our fishing poles, only heavier, and we 
put a Œ a spear at the end of it, and you co
uld spear fish through holes made in the 

ice. So Œ but all these things were local 
lore, and you ask peop
le, and they showed 
you how to do it, and th en yo
u did it, and Œ also, there 
were no street lights. And 

 
Interview with Al Jaffee 
 
 
May 21, 2016 
 

 
 
102
when  we would go visit our friends at ni
ght, you would overstay
 too long, and no Œ 
there was no one nagging you who said you 
better go home, it™s going to  get dark 
and all that. It just got dark, and th e p Œ 
the parents of our friends said, you better go 
home now. And now we got a couple of k
ilometers to walk in absolute pitch 
darkness, imagining that there are wolves 
out there. So, you make a lantern. And 
it™s very easy to make a lantern, 
Harry 
and I made so many lanterns, all made out 
of little pieces of wood, you Œ and you Œ yo
u go to a glazier, they cut you a little Œ a 
little rectangle of glass, and you slip it in Œ 
on thr Œ three or four sides of this little 
thing. It™s not easy to describe, but just Œ 
Q: But you made it, you made it. 
A: But we made it. And we felt very jolly
 marching home in the absolute darkness 
with our little lanterns. And we did this w
ith everything. We did this for capturing 
fruit from trees. The same kind of pole that 
we made the fishing pole out of, also 
served to have a hook at the end that you 
co uld reach up and snare an  apple. So we 

never went hungry, because the whole town
 had nothing but apple trees and pear 
trees and plum trees, and Œ depending on wh
at time of the season, we could always 
get something to  eat that way. And Œ but
 being creative, making things, making 
what you need instead of going out to bu
y it, was an experience I™ll never forget, 
and it has served me well in the rest of  my life because before I go out to buy

something, I think, what do 
I have around th at I can make it out of? And wh en I had 
a house and a basement and a Œ and some t
ools, I made a Œ a lot of things. I made 
toys for my children. I made, you know, all kinds of th ings. So I learned a lot in 
Za r a s a i
,
 Lithuania
, which I will never forget, and it™s Œ any time I™m feeling a 
little bit blue, with nothing to
 do, I think back to those 
days when I made all th ose 
things that gave us so mu ch pleasure. And so 
Lithuania
 Œ for me, 
Lithuania
 was a 
wonderful experience. I Œ I enjoyed the coun
try boy life. I mean, it was Œ it was just 
like 
Tom Sawyer
 or 
Huckleberry Finn
. 
Q: Well, thank you.  
A: You™re welcome.
