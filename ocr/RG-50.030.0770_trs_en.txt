A: 
Bia
ystok
 was the center city for the county of 
Bia
ostocka
(ph)
 Voivoidsfa
(ph). 
Voivoidsfa
(ph) 
Bia
ostotsky
(ph), that™s come from 
Bia
ystok
. There was one 
hospital at that time. I lived, for the firs
t year, somewhere on the ci Œ in the city. 
And when I was a year, or a year and a 
half, we moved to the part close to 
Pa
ac
 
Branitsky
, is 
Palace of Branitsky
. 
Q: And where™s that? 
A: I-In there, on part, they were divided, 
so there was a fence between the one park 
and the other. One was the school, which was 
just ordinary school with the school 
for the teachers. The other was the ci-city of 
Bia
ysto k 
where Œ where 
magistrat
(ph) is. 
Q: Was municipal authorities? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And at that part there was also a big la
ke where we used to 
slide during the night 
Œ du-during the winter. 

Q: So it would be frozen over? 

A: Why we moved to th at part, wh ich was the school, because my  mo ther was a 
teacher. Both of my parents has only 
education up to the matriculation. 
Q: What does that mean, matricul
ation? High school, or some college? 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

A: Twelve. High school, high school. 
Q: High school. Gy mn asium, and so, yeah . 

A: They didn™t have anything farther than
 that. So my mother
 was specialized in 
teaching the teachers, and because of that
, she was teaching e-even in high school, 
the 10
th
 an d 1 1
th
 Œ well, 13 grade. At that time th
e teacher, after 12 of the 13 grade. 
Otherwise, she has only the right to teach 
up to the ninth Œ sixth grade, sorry. The 
school was divided six grades, four grades
 and two top, and th en you have the high 
school. 

Q: So your mother was a teacher. 
Was your father also a teacher? 
A: No. He was the Œ they met in 
Wejherowa
, it™s close to the sea. She was a 
teacher and he wanted to be the soldier. And she convinced him to leave the army. I 

have no id ea what happened  duri
ng the war on 20 for my father. 
Q: In 1920. 

A: Because he Œ in 1920, he
 was 22. So most likely he 
was in the army. They never 
talk about that. The only 
thing my mo ther convince him to leave the army . And 
because he was in the army 
before, he was the army rese
rve. So from time to time 
he had to go and learn a bit mo re for a week or two. Otherwise, he was a clerk. A Œ 
mo st likely he was an accountant. I didn™t know mu ch about it. 
Q: I see.

A: And we lived in the build
ings close to the palace. 
Q: What™s a 
powets
? What™s a 
powets
? 
A: Palace. 
Q: Palace, okay. 
A: Mm-hm. The buildings were built Œ when
 I visit after the war, the walls were 
mo st likely close to a meter wide. So it was always warm, but of course for the 

restroom we would have to go Œ share it 
with two other familie
s and go downstairs 
somewhere. There was no hot water, and th
ings like that, because the building at 
that time was already 150 years old. 

Q: How was it that you lived in this palace? 
A: Because my mother was teach
ing in the school. So we Œ 
Q: And the school was located in the palace? 
A: Yes. 

Q: I see. O k ay. 
A: Oh, part of it. 
Q: I see. I see. 

A: And in the Œ there was a beautiful park
, there were tennis courts, which are very, 
very expensive, but I was not athletic. My
 brother, four years older than I am, was 
in tennis and swimming and everything. In 
Bia
ystok 
there wasn™t Œ there was a

river, but the river whose Œ which sm
ells very, very badly, because 
Bia
ysto k
 is a 
town of industry for clothing. 
Q: Textiles. 
A: And every Œ textile. And ev
erything went into that river, and vo Œ very small 
river. It used to be called 
Bia
ka
(ph). Right now they call it 
Bia
y Rzeka Œ Rzeka 
Bia
y
, which means 
White River
. It was really nothing, it was smelly always, not 
transparent, but no Œ no
r Œ no an imals, no nothing. 
Q: So it™s polluted. 
A: Enormously polluted. You can™t imagine. 

Q: Even before the war? 
A: Before the war. They were going to 
put it into undergro
und. What they did 
afterwards, I don™t know. I visited 
Bia
ysto k 
only once from this country , and it 
was completely different. Before the wa
r, it was 104,000 people. And apparently 
half of the population was Je
wish. I thought it only ab out a third. Part of the poorest 
part was Jewish, and they were all Œ also 
little shacks where they
 were selling every 
Œ food and everything, so we would go ther
e. And I™m sure that it was completely 
burned while eur Œ when the Je
wish people were fighting. 

Q: I see, so  Œ

A: But I wasn™t there at th
at time. Why I say about my 
father and ab out the Œ his 
experience, because when the 
war started, he had to go 
to the army, and with his 
army , he was going back, back, back Œ 
Q: Wait, excuse me, I™m going
 to interrupt. We™ll come 
to that point. I™d like to 
leave the Œ the stories and the ex periences 
about Wo rld War II to the side right now, 
and concentrate on Œ on wh at Œ wh at was life like pre-war. And I have a few 
questions already from what you were te
lling me, and they™re factual kinds of 
questions. 

A: One th ing also. 

Q: Sure. 
A: My mother had a servant Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ who was taking care of me, and cook
ing, because she was a teacher. But she 

was paying a lot. It we Œ the servant 
lived with  us, and she was paying 25 
z
oty
. If 
you could somehow Œ I think th at her mont
hly was 200, or something like th at, her 
mo th  Œ  my  mo
ther™s. So Œ 
Q: Your monthly Œ your mo the
r™s monthly salary was 200 
z
oty
? 
A: I think so , but I am not sure. I k
now that she was paying not 20, but 25 
z
oty 
to 
the servant.

Q: Per week or per month? 
A: For a month. Fo r a month. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And most of the servants had very 
little ed ucation. For one, her daughter was 
somewhere, and I was writing the letter, wh
ic h she was Œ so, she was completel y  Œ 
couldn™t say anything. 
Q: So sh e was not literate. 
A: Not Œ not at all. 
Q: So you would write letters
 for her to her daughter? 
A: Yes. 
Q: I see. 
A: And so, that I know. We lived in a conv
ertible place. My father, my mother, my 
brother, four years older, I and the servant. 

Q: Can I in-interrupt right here then? Your
 brother Œ if you are born in 1927, yes? 
A: He was born in ™23. 

Q: In 1923, okay. And his name was what?

Anto nyen

Warsaw
, and my mother from 
Przemy
˚
l
. Well, 
Warsaw 
is 
west of 
Bia
ystok
, and 
Przemy
˚
l 
is south. And I can tell you this story of my  
family. 

Q: Oh please, please. 

A: That™s a most likely true story, completely. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014

A: And the time is in 1683. 
Vienna  
was defending, and they ask king of 
Poland
 to 
Œ to c-come and rescue, and 
Vienna
 was defended. That was very important in the 
history of 
Euro pe
. 
Q: You mean when there was the 
Ottoman
 
Empire
, or the Turkish 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Forces were Œ 
A: And at that time, th e king w
ould conduct a fight from the hill. 
Q: Yes. 
A: And once a day, he was st
anding on the top of the 
hill, and there was a Turk 
coming on his horse. And the bo
y who was at the Œ we Œ th
ey bring all the food and 
so on. 

Q: Who was bringing th e food, I mean, I guess just the Œ a Œ a Œ a young boy who™s 

been Œ 
A: Young boy. And he saw 
that Turk coming, and he 
killed him. For that act 
Œ czyn
 
in Polish, he was name d 
Czynski
(ph), and the king ga-gav
e him somewhere Œ right 
now it™s 
Ukraine
, 
Humanya
(ph). He gave him a big pla
ce. And of course, he gave 
him Œ he was a nobleman, made a nobleman for that 
czyn
. And he was 
Czynski
(ph). My mother is Œ

12
Q: 
Czynska
(ph). 
A: Œ ma Œ was 
Czynska
(ph) from that. But the leet 
Œ that Œ that young boy was 
Jewish. And to be a nobleman he cannot 
be Jewish, he had to be Catholic. And 
because of that his mother Œ 
most likely they were poor. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And he was given a lot of
 land and being a nobleman 
for always, and she didn™t 
like it, chan-changing her allegiance, 
no. So  she curse him and Œ up to 11
th
 
generation. I™m his 11
th
 gener-gen eration. So what Œ 
I have one in 
2000 drop of 
Jewish blood. 

Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: But I really respect her, that being 
from poor to Œ and th
is is most likely 
completely true story. 
Q: Well, you know what is also interesting 
is that it is a story that was passed down 
through those 11 generations, to
 you. That is, it™s somethi
ng that stayed
 within the 
family Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ as Œ as Œ as a stor
y of how Œ so did 
your mother come from nobility? Could 
you say that she was born in  Œ

A: Well, in 
Poland
 there is a custom that if a fath
er had three sons or 10 sons, his 
property is divided equally, except if somebody goes to priesthood. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So th ey were pushing boys
 to priesthood so they wo
uld Œ and because of that, 
the noble people were sometimes have the 
piece of land just as m-much as the 
peasant. And the story, but I don™t know, 
it was mo  Œ mo st likely my  grandfather Œ 
Poland 
was taken by 
Russia
 and Œ and so on, three times. And once, my  
grandfather as a baby, was carried throug
h the border in a wash basket. So Œ  
Q: From 
Russia 
into Œ 
A: Œ then  they didn™t have Œ from 
Humanya
(ph), which was 
Poland
 Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and right now is 
Ukraine
, middle of 
Ukraine
 somewhere. 
Q: I see. 

A: I always hoped to  Œ to go th
ere and see whether there are any 
Czynski
(ph) there. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But mo st likely not. I don™t know. But an yway, so they  moved, and my  mo th er 

was in 
Przemy
˚
l
, somewhere connected with

. My grandfather 
died wh en  she was one year old. 

Q: Oh. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

A: And that™s also story in
 the family. She was the younger Œ youngest of four from 
second wife. Of course, the 
first one died, no Œ not di
vorced. So  she™s Œ for a 
woman, my mo ther was born 1898. So at that
 time, to bring up four children, so my 
father wish her Œ I wish that he Œ that
 that one will die for you. That was my 
mother. Well, three is easier 
than four. Sh e managed somehow. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: She gave good ed ucation for Œ 
Q: All her daughters. 
A: Good Œ 

Q: Yeah, all her children. 
A: Yes, yes. And she was work ing with a 
nurse na Œ nurse, servant and nurse. They  
were cooking and giving lunches to peop

October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
15
A: So, we believe that wom Œ women are 
equal, but comp letely different. But we 
are equal. 
Q: Yeah. Well, you survived, and Œ  
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and she brought up her children. 

A: Yes. So she was a teacher, and because 
of that we lived there. And sh e had a 
servant, she had to, but in comp arison I ca
n™t Œ did Œ I didn™t sa
y how big was our Œ 
Q: Yeah, tell me. 
A: Œ apartment. Four of us and the serv
ant, there were two rooms. One little room 
connected with two rooms, and kitchen, an
d so they co uldn™t be Œ that room could 
not be used for anything, only just storag
e of Œ cupboard . And the servant sleeps in 
the kitchen. 

Q: Wow. 

A: When  the Soviets expelled us, a man ca
me in and my mother says, well, we™re 
here only, and 
[indeciphera b le]
 there no room. And he said, oh, in our co untry 

even 
Stalin
 doesn™t have such a good
 room. And he believed. 
Q: Yeah, he believed, yeah, yeah . 
A: He believed. But it was really very sma
ll, but that was cheaper than Œ because of 
Œ 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
16
Q: She taught Œ 
A: Œ it was only for teachers Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ so it was slightly cheaper, 
I don™t know how mu ch it was. 
Q: So, I got the impression Œ tell us 
again, there will be people who know 
geographically where 
Bia
ysto k 
is, and others who don™t. 
Can you tell us where in 
Poland
 the city is? 
A: It™s halfway from 
Warsza wa
 to Œ you say 
Vilnius
, I™m saying 
Wilno
. 
Q: So it™s halfway between 
Wa rsa w 
and 
Wiln o
, and
 Wilno 
is in 
Lithuania
, so that 
means it™s in eastern 
Poland
. 
A: Yes, right now it™s very easter, but
 is part of Œ biggest part of 
Poland 
was taken 
by 
Soviet Unio n
. 
Q: So that means that it™s in
 the northeastern part, so Œ 
A: Slightly 
north to the 
Warsaw
, but it™s not very far. I think, if I™m right, it™s 110 
kilometers. That mean
s about 18 miles from
 Warsaw
. And wh en my  brother 
finished his middle school gymnasi
um, four years, that™s the 10
th
 grade, he decided 
to go and visit my aunt, which was in 
Pruszk ów
, which is very close to wa Œ 
Warsaw
, and my  grandparents were in 
Warsaw Œ 
on the bicycle. And he made it in

paved. It was just a ro ad. An
d that™s the ma

Warsaw
 to 
Wilno

Q: Now, within 
Bia
ystok
, were the roads paved? 
A: They were something what we call

Did they  have radios? Ho
w modern was a ci Œ was 
Bia
ystok

A: A Œ one of the teachers, they didn™t ha

days of th e war. I was coming Œ I™m somewhere close to that

 any Jewish friends? 
A: Yes. There were Œ there we

 a girl. The girl, nothing 
special. The boy was the 
mo st intelligent and he usually didn™t
 get the best grades, and I did.  
Q: Really? 
A: And I was completely sure that he was 
much brighter than 
I was. So Œ but the 
teacher was giving the boy less than me.

grades. And the 
[indecipherable]
 pedagogic. 
Q: Pedagogical, okay. 
A: Yes, and those teachers 
had to learn on us. And since 
in the country there were 
big classes Œ usually, I think, in 
Poland
 were, in cities it will 
be 30 in class. But in 
ours it was 40, and once I was in a connect
ed school, connected class, third and 
fourth  grade together, 60 kids
 all together, so the teacher
 would learn how to  do it. 
Only one year like th
at. So, there were big classes. 
And out of our 40, there were

three children who had the option Œ there wa

for an hour Œ they could stay, or they co
uld go out. That was 
not discrimination, 
they a Œ all Œ all the children were very, ve
ry glad to leave a
nd do whatever they 
want. 
Q: Not have to be Œ yeah. 

A: No, th at was definitely not discriminati
on, they could stay 
and learn. Our Œ for 
instance, we start with the 
prayer. They  would not have to pray  with us, only they 
have to stand up on the very beginning an
d the very en d of the school. But they 
would have to pass religion to 
pass to the next grade. So Œ 
Q: Their own religion? 

A: Their own religion. So the rabbi has to 
say that they passed 
the religion for the, 
say second grade, before they will go to th e 
third. But what they learn, that was his 
only. He did not have to say wh at he
 consider good for the second grade. 
Q: And you™re saying this was true 
for the Orthodox children as well? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . And were there 
many Orthodox children? 
A: In my class, only one. 
Q: And that brings me to 
another question. You mentione
d that you thought that the 
Jewish population of 
Bia
ysto k
 was maybe 30 percent, but 
after Œ truly afterwards

you

 half. So were there Ukrainians in 
Bia
ysto k
? Were there 
other nationalities? 
A: No. I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I don™t know. But there was a joke afte
r the Russians came in, th at people used 
to say when they were in 
White Russia
 or 
Ukraine
 Œ we call it 
White Russia
 Œ 
Q: You™re talking 
Belarus
? 
A: That they lived 
Bialosc
(ph). 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I can™t pronounce it properly
. They used to say that we
™re local, we™re local. And 
they say afterwards that Polish people want
ed  Œ for 20 years wanted to make them 
Polish and th ey didn™t, but the Russia
ns came  and did it in two weeks. 
Q: Well, there is some
thing to that, yes. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: I remember from learning
 about the region around 
Wilno
, the people wo uld say 
the same thing. Who are you? And they w
ouldn™t say I am Polish or I™m Lithuanian 
or I™m Russian. 

A: I™m local. 
Q: They say, I™m 
tutejszy
. I™m fro m here. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

A: Yes, 
tutejszy
 it™s lo cal, yes 
Q: Yeah, I™m from here. 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
Q: Which is an intere
sting kind of identity. 
A: Well, because it was under 
Russia
, 
Poland  
doesn™t exist for 150 years, and they 
felt Polish, so Œ 
Q: Sort of. Kind of. 
A: Kind of Polish. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: They knew that the Œ the 
others are strangers, the othe
rs are occupa Œ occupants. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And don™t Œ don™t treat people the sa
me ways. So Œ so, 
they were local. 
Q: They were local. So let™
s talk a little bit more about
 religion, a little bit. Was 
your family religious? 
A: My parents were not. They treat Œ well,
 I think that the Œ the problem was that 
they believed in regulation of birth, and 
that™s against the ga Œ Catholic church. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Oh, so th ey believed in birth contro l. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
24
A: Birth control. I believe that was the r
eason, but I don™t know
. But they kept us, 
we were going to Œ to church  every Su nday
, and Œ and well, th-they try not to talk 
about that, but because 
of they believe in bir-birth co
ntrol, they didn™t try to go to 
church  and pretend th at they are good Catholics. 

Q: I see. B u t you were Œ y
ou, nevertheless, would ha 
Œ take religion classes in 
school, and did you go through the various
 stages of, you know, having a First 
Communion and a Confirmation, and things like that? 
A: Yes, yes. There is only one thing. My
 mother told me that once a woman came 
to her and said, I don™t want my  child to be
 in a religion class. 
An d  my  mo th er said , 
what Œ well, I™m an ath e Œ atheist. So all through those years my  mo ther was 

[indecipherable]
 something. There was one atheist. 
Q: I see. 
A: And of course her child
, who would not go to  religi
on class because that was Œ 
only she could not provide a certificate of a
ny religion that he passed. So he was not 
learning. 

Q: Really? Okay. 

A: But one in years. So at
 that time it wasn™t, it was 
la Œ and there is one other 
thing, people av Œ wh o sa
y about anti-Semitism in 
Poland
. I believe that there was 
no Œ not really anti-Semitism. It wa
 Œ came during the war, brought by 
Soviet

Unio n
. My husband was a mathematician, 
and he knew a mathematician in 
Poland
 
who was very distinct in Œ in 
Warsaw Polytechnic
. I forgot his name right now. 
And he was very respected, s-some grand 
or something like that, one year, and th e 
second year they told
 him to get out of 
Poland
, they allowed him. But he was 
married to a Catholic woman an d had Cat
holic child. So he was expelled and not 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And 
[indecipherable]
 sort of Œ 
A: That was during the war. And he lived with us, he came to 
United States
, he 
lived with us for a w
eek or two. And right now, if he
™s alive, he™s still teaching in 
an Œ 
Ann Arbor
. But that came, that one year 
everything was Œ was bad, it was 
supposed to be bad because
 of Jewish people. And I 
think so mething was bad, 
people can™t take very easily. So most 
likely right now there is the real anti-
Semitism in part of 
Poland
, not to everybody. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But it was definitely Œ I Œ I want to 
give you what was be
fore the war. There 
were some Œ 
Q: Tell me before the war, mm-h m. 
A: Before the war there were some
 people extremist who were saying 
bi
 
)
yda
. 
Q: What does that mean? 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
26
A: Beat the Jew. That Œ those were extrem
ists, but hardly ever. And so that was not 
showing what the population was. But we ha
ve, don™t buy in  Jewish store. Last few 
years we e Œ if we could avoid. And 
th e reason was economic, because before 
Poland
 received independence into ninet Œ 18 
Œ Jewish people were taking part of 
commerce. Because for a nobleman it was not nice, so if he brings some food, 
somebody had to bring into th e city. And th
at was what Jewish people were doing. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Then 
[indecipherable]
 Jewish population was very l-
large. Out of 30 millions Œ 
no, 33 million people we had 
before the war, three million were Jewish. Because 
when in the western 
Europe
 in, I don™t know, 15
th
 16
th
 century, when  there were a 
fight and they didn™t wan Œ like Jewish pe
ople, Jewish people came, and apparently 
just past the e-e-
eastern border of 
Poland
 there was a biggest population o-of 
Jewish people, because we accepte
d them. So that was only when 
Poland
 get the 
independence, and we started to modern
 life, somebody had to have the Œ the 
shopkeep ers could not be only Jewish pe
ople. And because of that, Jewish people 
were fighting th e new stores. Of course, th
at was economic fight. The whole part of 
was Œ some Jewish people were giving m
oney to this storekeeper who was next to 
the new Polish store Œ not Po lish, Christian 
store. Jewish people were Polish people. 
But they  were giving him money, so Jewish store had ev erything cheaper. After a

time, after a year or two, the other one has 
to close. Then, the prices in Jewish store 
went up. That was known, and because of th
at we were, don™t buy in Jewish store. 
But that was not anti-Semitism. T h is was 
justified of Œ as I said, the noblemen, 
since they gi Œ were giving to every son,
 th en they were poorer and poorer. That 
was a cul Œ sort of culture. But Œ 

Q: I want to Œ I Œ I want to go to Œ 
I understand what you 
are explaining, but I 
would like to Œ I would like to focus on, did 
this play out in your life at all? Did 
your parents talk about such things when
 you were growing up, ab out Œ did you Œ 
for example, when you went with your se
rvant Œ by the way, what was her name, 
the servant? 
A: They change, from one to the other. 
Q: I see, so  it wasn™t always the same person. 

A: Yes, for 12 Œ 12 years, 
there were two or three. The first one was the one which 
work ed with my  mo ther, providing lunches to people. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So sh e was my  Œ my  nurse on the very  beginning. 

Q: So Œ I mean, was Œ how did this play
 out when  you were growing up? Did you 
know there was a difference between Jewish children an d your Œ an d yourself, 

outside of the religions classes? 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
28
A: No, I knew something. 
For instance, I Œ I™m Œ 
well, I live in commun Œ 
community where is a lot of Jewish peopl
e. There are two synagogues. For me it 
was a surprise that there are different 
kind of Jewish Œ that they need  two 
synagogues close to each other. 

Q: That means in 
Bia
ystok
? 
A: No, no, here. 

Q: Here, here, okay. 
A: In 
Silver Spring
. 
Q: I see. 
A: I live in place where there™s a lot of Je
wish people. But, for instance, I knew tha 
Œ and I always wonder wha Œ from me tothe closest synagogue is mo re that 1,000 

paces. And I learned that Jewish people canno
t walk farther than 
10,000 paces. So 
how can stretch it? They don™t drive, of c
ourse. They go Œ walk to synagogue. But I 
knew about that. I knew about matzah.  
Q: Mm-hm, about Passover, and 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Ye-Yes, I like it very mu ch. I didn™t know that it™s a religious, the triangular 
cake, but we had triangle ca-cakes with pop
py seeds inside, and big one, no-not the 
short one, but short like Œ 
Q: I think these are called 
hamantashen
, I™m not exactly sure. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
29
A: I Œ I don™t know, but I knew some things 
[indeciphera ble]
 that they had to wash 
the Œ all the dishes somewhere. So, we 
knew a little bit of the Jewish culture. And 
of course, my parents were very much ag
ainst us. That was just before the war, 
there were some people who were against Je
ws very strongly, and my parents were 
saying that it™s Œ it was completely silly.When we had to, during the war, under the 
Russian occupation, we had to go to 
Warsaw
, to German Œ 
Germ any
 
[indecipherable]
. So, my  mo ther went to a friend who was a doctor, and she gave 
my  mo th er a sig n  th at my  mo th er h as a weak
 Œ weak heart, and have to stay at home 
for three weeks. That was in case we
 would not be able
 to pass through 
Wa rsaw
, 
and she would have to come 
back, so she will be able 
to get her job again. Of 
course, that was something wh at she Œ it was be punish ed by wh atever, maybe 

sending to 
Siberia
. But she gave it to
 my mother. So Œ 
Q: And she was a Jewish lady? 

A: She was Jewish, yes. 
Q: Yes, I see. 
A: And also we have a doctor, h-he was Je
wish. When  we starte
d t o  buy only in 
Christian stores, we didn™t change him. 
So, it was a Jewish doctor. So I really 
believe strongly there was no an ti-semit Œ an
ti-Semitism is always in all the world, 
but in 
Poland
 it was not strong. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

Q: I see. 
A: But people believe right now, but taking 
a bad thing is very, very easy, and since 
Soviet Unio n
 were saying that everything is 
fault of Jewish people, and so you 
know, it start. 

Q: So let™s Œ let™s go back to Œ let™s go ba
ck to the events of your life, and your 
family™s life. You were Œ you 
were then Œ your father wa
s working as a clerk, your 
mother was teaching Œ 
A: A teacher. 
Q: Œ you were attending the school, whic
h was kind of like the children were the 

guinea pigs for teachers in training. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: And did you Œ 

A: In Œ mostly were normal school. Only  from time to time we had that Œ 

Q: That sort of situation. Did your
 parent talk about politics at home? 
A: A lot. 

Q: Really? 

A: Of course, we eat always in Œ i-in
 Œ around the table, not Œ not in front 
TV
 or 
something like Œ 

Q: Yeah, there was no such. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

A: So, they were always talking. My father
 was very interested 
in social things. But 
I don™t know Œ 
Q: Were they Œ I mean, were they supporters
 of any one particular party, or any one 
particular kind of public Œ 
A: I wish I knew Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ but I don™t. There was only one thing. In 
Poland
 Œ here you have the names Œ I 
was so-so Œ it was so funny for me when I 
think he was the principal of the school 
somewhere in 
Gloucester
 where I live years ago, and the street was named by him. 
And so there was some thing opening, and 
I shake his hand. Why it was so funny for 
me, because in 
Poland
 there is no Œ right now there is 
a lot of streets named by Œ by 
the Pope. Bu t otherw ise Œ I don™t know wh ether that changed, but in 
Bia
ystok
, 
there was a street named by 
Ko scza
(ph) 
Kowske i
(ph) was mi Œ misa Œ some Œ 
someone in government. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And my father objected to it. And because
 of that he lost his job, and for four 
years Œ that was eight years before the war 
Œ for four years he c
ould not find a job, 
and then  all the savings are Œ went down . He had one job somewhere in 
Silesia
, and 
he Œ somehow he lost it, after he have a ye
ar. So it Œ we Œ we we
re really using all

the savings. And then  he got the job in 
Ta rnopo l
, which is 
Ukraine
 right now in 
that. 
Q: In tarno Œ in 
Ta rnopo l
, yeah. 
A: 
Tarn opol
, yes, there was a 
Voivodswa
(ph)
 Tarnopolski
(ph). And so Œ 
Q: Okay, so was the region of 
Tarnopo l
, yeah. 
A: Mm-hm. He used to come to us for 
Christmas, and we were going for vacation 
down there. 
Q: And so, if I understand this properly, 
your father had strong political views of 
one kind Œ 
A: And because of that he™s Œ 
Q: Œ and that got him into trouble. 
A: Yes, in trouble, because not that he 
cannot Œ there Œ there 
were no work. They 
did not want him to get work . 

Q: So there really was blackli Œ 
A: It was a punishment because he sa
id the streets should not be called Œ 
Q: After this minister? 

A: Yes.

d this minister belong to? 
A: I have no idea. 
Q: Do you have to Œ 
A: You may be able to find it. 
Q: I don™t know. What di
d your parents think of 
Ma rshall Pilsudski
? 

A: That I don™t know, because 
in school I don™t think that
 they were with him. But 
anyway, he Œ 
Pilsudski
 was in school a very  important person. And my  mo ther, like 
she was teaching me to be Catholic, she 
was teaching me to good Pole. And that 
was Œ I™m not sure that they were with hi
m very much. I don™t know Œ I Œ I was too 
young to  understand when  he started some
 trouble, where they were in that Œ 
Q: What they thought of it Œ 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: No, I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . Were they Œ would you think thou
gh Œ I™m trying to get a sense of what 
was their political orientation. Were th
ey more on a liberal side, on a Œ on a 
socialistic side? I Œ I only suggest that because you say th
ey were for birth control. 
And in those years, very often Œ 
A: That was progressive, very progressive. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

34
Q: Progressive, yes. 
A: I know th at there Œ one teacher had th
ree ch ildren, and they were saying it™s too 
much. And that time in  Œ wh
en my mother, during the wa
r was teaching in Œ in the 
country, my  friend was one of 14. 

Q: Wow. 

A: So th at was the usual. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: So, one thing. My fa
ther, when he was in 
Tarnopol
, he was away from the 
family. He was playing 
Bridge
, which is how we Œ 
Q: It™s a card game, yes? He was playing 
Bridge
, the card game? 
A: Yes, yes, card game. And for a very sm
all amountof money, 
but he also always 
winning and bringing money home. 
Q: Really? So, he was good at it? 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 very little. B u t apart from that, he
 had nothing to do. So he was 
apparently  taking, at that time, everywhere
 in the country, people during th e winter 

were just suffering, because 
they had nothing to wo rk , not
hing to eat, and so on. 
And so he was supporting the peasant Œ pe
asants™ art. A nd apparently there was a 
shop cl Œ something for that
 opened before th
e war, already for a few years. And 
people were so grateful to my father, th
at they gave him an how Œ ho Œ handwoven

carpet, which was, when I came here I sa
w something close by Œ close to it, it will 
be a thousand or 2,000 dollars™ worth here. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, something that beautiful Œ 
A: And they  gave it to him Œ 
Q: As thanks. 

A: Œ for what he was doing. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But what he was doing, I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So Œ so definitely he 
was for the people, but on th
e other ha-hand, my  mo ther 
was paying that five 
z
oty 
more than usual, the Œ th
at™s way other people were 
taking th is Œ her servan ts, ta
ught by her, and so on. But, so
 was sort of equality for 
people, good, bad. Also the Œ I would say 
that it would be for everybody, strike 

your own, and help other people. 
Q: So those were their values. 
A: It was not Œ it was the values Œ not socialist values. 

Q: Okay . 
A: But still good for other people. 
Q: Okay .

A: And I think for both my parents. 
Q: I see. 

A: My Œ my  mo ther was a teacher who Œ 
who would try to  do everything for ev-
every child. It was not just working th
ose hours, she was a really teacher. 
Q: I want to ask something about Œ about 
your family in a pers Œ more personal 
way. Is Œ what was the family dynamic? Wa
s your Œ were you cl
oser to one parent 
than the other? 
A: Another story. My father was at work
 when  I was born in the hospital. And my  
mo ther somehow called by telephone. And th
e people around us, oh it™s a girl Œ boy 
Œ girl. I lost my  second boy. They wanted
 to  have only two children, and I was a 
girl. 

Q: Ah. 

A: So, my father
 told me that. 
Q: Yeah. Jokingly. 
A: Jokingly. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, right then he

A: Whether my  mo ther had a favorite, 
I don™t know. But I definitely was his 
favorite. 

Q: And what kind of pe
rsonalities did they have? 
A: Is difficult for me to say. 
Q: Were they outgoing? I mean, they sound 
like they were very Œ they liked being 
with people. If they Œ if their Œ 
A: Yes, they must be, but to 
me they were perfect, really. 
Q: Ah. 

A: Let me say with the 
[indecipherable]
 because I will be most
 likely coming back 
also, to things other. When wa
r started, my father had to 
go to  Œ to th e army . And he 
Œ everybody was going back, ba
ck, back, so they 
will re Œ reorganize and start to 
fight Germans, straight. 

Q: So they were retreati
ng in order to regroup. 
A: Retreating all the time, because they 
were going to  reorganize. We had pact Œ 
pact of 
nieagresji
. A pact with 
Russia
 that we™ll not be fighting each other.

Poland
 
A: Œ had interaction Œ 
Q: A non-aggression Œ 
A: Œ non-aggression pact.  

Q: Œ aggression pact, okay. 

A: So we did not expect our
 friends to free Œ free us. 
Q: I see. 

A: So they came in Œ before
 that, there was a appeal to ev erybody, young man. My 
Œ my  brother was 16, but he Œ to retr
eat and form the ar
my  and fight back. 
Q: Okay. I understand. 

A: So he was retreating also. 

Q: I want to Œ excuse me, I want to Œ I wa
nt to ask a few other questions about this, 
since we™re going to  start into 
this. But before I left your family, I w anted to ask one 
mo re question th at was about the fa
mily, and then go
 on to the war. 
A: Yes? 
Q: And that was what kind of a person 
was your brother, and 
were you close to 
him?

A: I was very close to, he was my  friend, not only my  brother. On ly four years 
older. He was teasing me from time to time, 
but we were really friends. And he was 
very athletic. I was Œ I was always choosi
ng my  food, and I was small, and tiny and 
not athletic at all. And he was in everyt
hing, and he was playing music Œ piano. My 
mo ther was Œ wanted  me to learn piano, I 
was learning for four years, because piano 

you don™t have to have good hearing to  Œ to
 be able to play. Bu
t he was very good, 
one of the Œ had some concerts and so  on. 
So  by 16 he was known as good pianist, 
and good tennis play er. We had that tennis 
courts, which that™s a very expensive Œ 
because you don™t ha Œ you had to pay 
for that, but since it was on the school 
grounds, we Œ we have it. So he was ve
ry, very athletic, and my best friend. 
Q: Oh. So now this Œ 
A: Even four years older. 

Q: That™s Œ that™s amazing. I mean, th
ere are very few sibling Œ I mean, many 
siblings are close, but such that they coul

 First Germans come to 
Bia
ysto k
 for one week. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
47
Q: Okay . 
A: In the school there was Polish hospital Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ because there Œ there was a big kitche
n, and my  mother wa Œ hated cooking. 
But she volunteered to help 
in th e kitchen. And I was 
wiping the Œ she wa Œ she 
wasn™t cooking, luckily, 
for people. But she was washing the dishes, and I was 
wiping it and going out and putting th e wa
ter out. When Germans came, since that 
was already hospital, Germans took it as 
a hospital for one week. And then  they 
retreated because Russians were
 supposed to, according to 
Mo lotov-Ribben trop
, 
Bia
ysto k
 was supposed to be in Russian. So 
they retreated, and Russian took th e 
hospital, and there was a hospital, with
 a vo Œ very good docto rs. A Œ amp-
amputation of the leg or hand lo ok awful, bu
t it™s one of the easiest thing to do. And 
people were saying that if that one docto r there would cut the leg off, the person 
would die for sure. It was a horrible thing. 
When the war started,
 all the stores had 
to be open , whether they have anything to
 sell, or not. And that Œ the woman who 
had the store with Œ with Œ I™m thinking 
in Polish when I am 
talking about that. 
Q: It™s okay. Okay. It takes a little b
it of time sometimes 
to find the words. 
A: Yes. Somewhere where you sell the medicine. 

Q: Ph-Pharmacy? 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

A: Yeah, pharmacy. The owner of the pha
rmacy had th at pharmacy open. Sh e told 
th at to  my  mo th er, my  mo th
er told me. There wa Œ came a man, and she said, I™m 
sorry, but I don™t have anything left. And,
 you really don™t? What about that? And 
there were the Œ were the little baby, you pu t here in his mouth so he won™t cry. 
Q: Oh, you Œ oh, you mean the Œ I know 
th e word  in Œ in the wrong languages. 
Thank you very mu ch , a pacifier. 

A: Pacifier, yes. 
Q: Thank you. So, it was a pacifier, right. 
A: A pacifier. And that was a Russian Œ I 
think Russian officer, 
but an Œ anyway, is 
Russian. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And she ask hi-him, you want one or tw
o? No, all of them. And he bought 50. 
Everything what we had, it was 
really luxury 
for them. And Œ 
Q: So you say the stores emptied out, is th
at what you™re sayi
ng, when the Russian 
army came in? 

A: Well, it was almo st ev Œ empty, everyt
hing was sold, nothing brought in. So sh e 
said, I don™t have anything, I Œ and only t
hose pacifiers. And since there were 50 
pacifiers, he bought 50 pacifiers. There 
were a time when we didn™t have bread, 
when  Œ an d once we had 
ha lva h
, you know what it is? 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
49
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: We could buy a lot of 
ha lva h
, and we were eating that 
halvah
, because that™s 
what brought to Œ was brought to 
Poland
. And just the beginning of the war, 
Russians were going to the main square. In 
Poland
 there was Œ nuns had th e 
orphanag e. And they  were going to take
 the orphanage, th e whole orphanage or 

something. That was one of the first 
ma -main thing. People learn about that, 
everybody came to that square. 
Q: Square. 
A: Thousands of people, and we didn™t le
t Russians take the nuns out. My brother 
was there, I wasn™t. 
Q: So, they were going to Œ they were going to Œ 
A: To take that orphanage somewhere, 
all children from the nuns. I don™t know 
exactly what, but I know that we went. Ther
e™s another thing. The Œ the first Œ first 
half year of the war, we were sent to di
fferent classes, mi xed together. People were 
saying Œ once my  mo ther said, be very 
careful what you say, because somebody 
said that you said, when Polish 
ef Œ officers will come from 
Lithuania
, we™ll have 
free 
Poland
 again. That was be for me, 12 ye
ar old, would be so stupid. Bu t 
somebody had to say something about me, a
nd because th at Œ they  said that stupid 
thing. And my  mu  Œ somebody warned my  mo
ther, my mother say, be very careful

what you are saying. On  the other hand, th
is first half a y ear again, we had in 
Poland
, a cross in front of the class. We us
ually pray ju st before the classes and 
after the school end. And Ru
ssians told to take the cro
sses out. No  crosses in school. 
So in my  brother™s school, they  had the Œ 
not Œ not al-always on
e, but one of them 
would bring a cross every day,
 put it there, take it down 
afterwards. But duringthe 
classe s, the re was cross there. In my s Œ 
and in my  school Œ and that was already 
mix, because I went to seventh grade fro
m six, that was different school, and 
because of that, I knew half of half Œ they
 were specially mixed, so you will never 
know. And once, we were finishing the 
class where would Œ we would say the 
prayer. And we were saying th e prayer 
even when  there was a Œ I don™t know 
whether we had a cross, or there was no 
cross, but we were praying into that 
direction. Oh, of course, 
in every class there was 
Stalin
 and somebody else there.  
Q: You mean the picture. 
A: Picture, yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So us Œ one of the girl
s, and that™s already in that mixed school, say, are you 
going to  pray to the 
Stalin
? And without anything we tu
rn around, and then after 
that, every day when  we Œ was a prayer, we 
would stand up, turn  around, so back to

afraid, afraid. 
Q: But I™d like to ask this. You mentione
d of a story of, you know, where a Russian 
officer went Œ or Soviet officer went to
 a pharmacy. Did you see soldiers in the 
streets? Did you see any th at you had any contact with? 

A: They was Œ they were marching, the w
hole battalion or something, I don™t know, 
and they  were Œ were always singing. They
 sing beautifully, even
 in the army, they 
sing not one voice, but two voices. 

Q: In harmony, yeah , mm-hm.

A: And looking at my mother. Since she sa
id so, I Œ I didn™t know what it was. 
Later on, wh en I was grown up, I learned. 
I remember it. People, as people, were 
pretty nice. Nobody complain
 about them. There were no
 Œ no excesses. But they 
do what they were told to do 
the Œ and that one told us to
 get out of th Œ our house 
to somewhere else
, because even 
Stalin
 doesn ™t live so luxurious we did. 
Q: And so, when  did that happen? Di

will be fine. So my Œ my father, first of all,
 he was jokingly said that he will Œ marry 
Œ married my mother because he
 wanted to have children. So
 of course he wanted to 
go back to  children. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And he was the first one to sign that 
he is going to . And he told me that. He 
make a bid Œ big fuss when  the first transpor

fear. That we were Œ will be the next in, our family. 
Q: I see, to be deported, mm-hm. 
A: Deported. And my  parents pack ed ev er
ything what could be necessary. And then 
the gossip or true, came that
 young girls were taken to 
the house of prostitution for 
soldiers. So my parents decided no, we™re 
not going to , we Œ we™re going to try to  
get to 
Warsaw
. 
Q: So, get out of the Russian occupied area? 
A: Yes, to German occupied area. 

Q: Mm-hm. I see.  
A: And at that time they were still friends
, German and Russians. We Œ we went Œ 
the last night I even slept at my neighbors,
 because they were to
ld that in case my 
parents will be arrested that night, to se
nd me and I will be going with that part, 
through the Œ they were not. 

Q: You mean, if they would have 
been arrested to be deported?

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ who was Œ his wife was pregnant. 
He was arrested, and for some reason 
[indecipherable]
 let Œ let go. From that time on, 
all the teachers, if their Œ if he 
would co me close by, they would start to speak about weather, and things like that. 
Because everybody knew that if he was le
t out, it was because of pregnant wife, and 
somebo Œ the threat him so, not to
 speak in front of him, and Œ 
Q: So, he could be an  informer? In other word s, he was let go Œ 

A: He mo st likely was promised to be an
 in fo rmer and because of that, nobody 
blamed him, only everybody was very careful,
 because we did ex pect that he was an 
informer. And that was the fear all the tim
e, fear who will say 
what, and what next. 
So, we Œ we were trying to  cross the border. 
I had a fever at that Œ I Œ I was Œ some 
common thing which people right

A: No way. So we were 
trying, and we were caught
. Those people who were 
leading us, never were caught 
before that, and that was 13
th

Warsaw
, they would say, we™re coming from 
Bia
ysto k
. And because of that, they would be se
nt through. But th
is time they were 
looking for a spy, or somebod
y. And because of that, a

40, maybe 50 people. One child was always 
given so mething to  sleep, and they Œ

 And we saw him after the interrogation, 
a few months, and my mother said
 that he still had blacks place. 
Q: Black and blue marks? 
A: Black and blue. And he was once 
saw a woman Œ pregnant woman being 
interrogated, and she was kicked in her 
stomach, and her blood came through the 
mouth. So  th at was the kind of interroga
tion. But anyway, finally his Œ they were 
asking him, where did you 
put the arma ment and Œ an
d how mu ch  and where? And 
he didn™t, so he was saying no, no, no, and finally it was too mu ch fo r him, after a 
week or two or three, and he said, I™ll be
 talk ing. That my father told me. And I 
cannot say exactly what it was, b u t the Œ he sa
id, yes, I am put in Œ there Œ there is a 
national park close there. In the nationa

guns. He was writing. Four hundred 
cannons. He was writing. And something like 
that. Finally he said, and three planes. 
Then  that man beat him once mo re, and kn

weren™t given any food at all, and in pris
on they were pretty hungry already. And 
then, after three days, they were let go. 
And good heart almost
 killed my father, 
because he was working so
mewhere, and the woman wh
o was making butter, saw 
that he was from the prison, and gave him 
that big lump  of bu
tter, which she just 
made. And after three days of
 not eating and one 
year of pri Œ being hungry, he ate 
all that, and was very, very
 sick. Then he went to 
Bia
ystok
, to where we used to 
be. And he was waiting that maybe my  brothe
r Œ he learn in prison that my  brother 
was arrested, we Œ we thought that he was already in 
France
. And so he wa-w aited 
for about a month, and then co
me to us. And th en he had 
that Œ that he could show 
that bla Œ 
Q: Black and blue. 
A: Œ black and blue. 

Q: So he was able to ge
t Œ okay, by that point Œ 
A: By Œ by then, 
Germans were in 
Bia
ystok
 as well. 
Q: Stock Œ yeah, yeah . 

A: Œ because they moved forward. As Œ 

Q: So you hadn't  seen Œ ex
cu se me Œ you hadn't seen your father from the time you

rolled territory, and he was arrested, and

that was in May 1940, until well over a 
year and maybe in the summer, sometime 
1941, is when you see him again. 
A: But my mother, when th
e war started Œ war between 
German and Russian, didn™t 
want us to Œ to be separated. She found 
a job as a teacher in 
the country south of 
Warsaw
, and I was staying with my  aunt and 
traveling. That was also something I 
was doing already 13, but trav
eling every day to school, 
which was illegal. It w as 
called Œ because after six years, it was onl
y trade school. So my  school was called 
za b a wka r ska
, something prepared  to make toys. 
So  we had, I think nine hours of 
paint Œ drawing, and six hour
s of making something a week
, a ye Œ a week, plus the 
normal courses. But of course the normal books were kept at home only. Teacher 
was saying and we were l
earning that way. Bu t Œ and I was traveling from 
Pruszków
 to 
Warsaw
 every day, and then  I Œ I know that I had to have a 
photograph for my license, or some Œ no Œ 

Q: 
I
.
D
. 
A: I Œ 
I
.
D
. And so if you are 13 and never did th
at, to go to do it, it was something, 
yeah. 

Q: It was probably very frighten ing.  

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
64
A: Yes, I know that it was. But when the 
war started, with the Germans attacked 
Russia
, then  my  mo ther sa Œ came and take me
 to the country. Fo
r two years, I was 
learning from books, and Œ 
Q: Can you hold Œ ho Œ excu se me.  
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: I want Œ hold that thought. Can we cut for a second 
[break]
 Okay, so as I 
explained, I™d like to find out, before I 
forget, the sequence of events for your 
brother. The last I understood is that he™s
 a scout, help ing people wh en there are 
bombard ments in 
Bia
ystok
, and bringing a man to Œ to a hospital, and someone 
criticized him for that. And th
en he™s with the Boy Scouts,
 and they retreat Œ he was 
a scout, and they Œ they  
retreat and come back. 
A: Let me say one thing, because we™ll Œ 
we™ll show the Œ what
 kind of upbringing 
it was. My brother started to smoke, and sc
outs were not supposed  to smoke. So  he 
was going in  the fall, say I™m Œ I cannot 
be a scout any mo re. And my  mo ther was 
in scouting, sh-she Œ she was smoking, 
she could not be the normal only was 
helping with camps and so on. But she was 
very involved as we
ll. But my brother 
was going to  say, I™m not going to  be
 a scout because I cannot stop. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
65
A: And then the war started, so he, as a sc
out, went to help in 
that hospital, because 
he knew that™s mo re important than that, 
but he was going not 
to be involved. But 
he was very  involved in scouting. Then  he
re, when the Œ there 
was appeal to young 
men, and see, he was 16 only. He went 
because he wanted to join  the army . 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Then he came back, and 
he was in school a little bit Œ well, he was Œ I don™t 
know, he was taking part in the Œ putting 
the cross on the wall. But I don™t know 
whether it was 
[indecipherable]
 or there were others, it 
could be. He told me also, 
that™s the first half o-of the Œ that™s ™39,  that he joined some underg round army , and 

a 16 telling her Œ his 12 year old sister, don™
t tell anybody, but I™m in that. And if 
they will tell me to shoot 
somebody, I™m going to shoo
t to kill. A 16 year old. 
Q: It™s frig h tening. 

A: It™s hard thing. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But he Œ I knew th at he was already in
 something. But then the Polish army was 
formed in 
France
, and through 
Romania
 you could get there. He was pretty tall. 
He was 5™10ﬂ wh en he grew up
. But at that time he was pr
etty tall, straight, athletic. 
And somebody stupid enough,
 who was going to take hi
m through the border, told 
him to wait at the railway sta
tion. He was arrested there.

letters, and I come to the letters later. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And that™s the only thing wh at I know
. I don™t know even wh ere he was in 
Siberia
. When the Œ there was a park between 
Poland
 and 
Russia

Katy n
, so at 
Katyn
 there, they started ignore us. 
But they allowed people to go 
south and form an army, 
Anders™ Army

Q: So this was after Œ afte
r the Germans attacked the 
Soviet Union
, there were 
many Po lish people who were Œ had been sent to 
Siberia

in order that they could go 
back and fight the Germans.

A: Yes, but I don™t know mu ch about it. 
Q: I see. 
A: But he went down Œ apparently that Œ

just walked , or Œ I Œ how he did, I have no
 idea. But there was a first transport to be 
sent to 
England
, those people who wanted to 
join Marines and air force. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And he wanted to  join Marines. But si
nce they were on the sh
ip for a lo
ng, long 
time, I think they 
had to go around 
Africa
. A friend told him, jo
in the air force. So 
he wanted to join the air force, but since 
he Œ he was hungry fo
r long, long time, his 
eyesight was not very good, so he could no
t be a pilot, only 
the navigator. So  he 
was a navigator, he was trained in 
Canada
, and th en Œ 
Q: Let™s break a bit, excuse me. 
[break]
 Okay, so Œ 
A: He flew in 
[indecipherable]
 was na-navigator, 50 Œ 50
 times. That™s it Œ one 
tour. Later they changed to 
a hundred or 150, I think.
 But at that time it was 
beginning, it was only 50. 
So he flew 50 over 
Germany
.

Germany
?

what he said. Afterwards, he was send to a 
school for officers, and that™s usually in 
Polish army  it™s only when  you have the high
 school finished, and he had only 10 Œ 
10 grades, but he was sent 
that. And th e war ended in 
Europe
 in May, I believe. In 
Œ since he was not in fighting army  at that 
time, fi Œ fighting air force, air force was 
under the British command. 

Q:

my  father was Œ my  brother was looking 
through it whether my mother was there, 

and he was surprised to find me. So we st
ar Œ started to exchange letters, and he 
sent me 13 letters. So all I know about him is from those letters.

Q: Yeah. 
A: And of course the letter was, I™m sorry, 
I cannot do anything about it. I Œ I hope 
that it will Œ so he never managed to get us to 
England
. A-After he died, is the man 
who was in 
Tarnopol
 that told my father

r German occ-occupation then. And the 
teacher would ask who had trouble with 
school. And somebody would say, I cannot 
do th e third one. So  come to the blackboard  
and we™ll explain. That was the kind of 
le Œ teaching usually when you™re in scho
ol you do not say th

so we were looking for granules of coal. 
And yes, it was cold. 
But my father said 
no, you Œ you cannot be there, you have to go to school
. How he found th e school, 
through whom that they would trust me that
 they would be there,
 because of course, 
everybody could always say somethi
ng. So my  mo th Œ my  father Œ 
Q: I™m sorry, I need to interrupt a little bit, 
just to clarify . Your mother is in this 
village outside of 
Wa rsa w
 and she™s teaching legally, because the children are 
younger than sixth grad e. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So sh e™s earning a salary by doing it, 
and doesn ™t have to worry about this. 
A: Except that the salary wa
s roughly the same salary 
as before the war, and the 
prices went up. 

Q: Of course.

A: Luckily, custom in 
the village is to bring two eggs
, to bring an apple, to bring 
something. And we had a little plot of 
land where we coul
d grow so mething. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Not too much, but 
something, as well. 
Q: So when your father comes back 
from having been released from prison Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in about the summer of 1941, does he 
find you and your mother in this village? 
A: Yes, because he had sister in pr Œ 
Pruszków
, which is close to 
Warsaw
, and his 
parents in 
Warsaw 
itself. 
Q: I see. 
A: Sorry, not parents, my  grandfather 
died in ™39, wh ere Germans was fighting 
about 
Wa rsa w
. And my  grandmother was very, very
 frightened  of everything, and 
everybody thought that if 
you go to  the cellar it will be
 safer, and everybody was 
going to  the cellar, and somebody pushed  my
 grandfather Œ by Œ by chan ce. He fell, 

and was unconscious til Œ til th
e very end of the Œ of hi
s life. And that was soon 
after Germans took 
Wa rsa w
. But my mo Œ my grandmother was very, very 
frightened , so she took him to Œ to his bedroom, second or third floor, I don™t 

remember, instead of goin
g to the cellar where Œ

so much noise, she put her 
Œ what™s Œ wh at do you call? 
Something what you cove
r yourself in bed? 
Q: Blankets, duvets? 
A: Not blanket, but something fluffy. 
Q: Something fluffy? A quilt? 

A: Yes. She put the quilt into the Œ  

Q: Windows? 
A: Œ windows, so that she wouldn™t hear so
 much, and stayed with him all that time. 
Q: Oh my. And yet she Œ 
A: She died soon after. 
Q: Did she, yeah. And so your father, when
 he came  back, he found you with  your 
mother together Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ in this one Œ and how 
Œ did he move in with you,
 or did he mo ve you to 
Warsaw
? What happened? 
A: No, he went to 
Warsa w
 by himself, and joined  the 
[indeciphera ble]
 army 
[speaks Polish]
. That was before 
Armia Kryova
. 
Armia Kryova
 is home army . 
[speaks Polish]
 Œ when I joined, it was 
Armia Kryova
. And after a time, it was 
beginning of 1943, he took me to 
Warsaw
. And on the very beginning I had to have

some papers, safe papers, 
because without the papers 
anybody could be sent to 
Germany
 straight away. So I was working to 
Red Cross. I was in arc h ives, so I 
learned how to put it. Everything was what 
finished, I was suppos
ed to put in the 
sides. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I didn™t know at that time, but 
the daughter of my  boss, she was in 
Armia 
Kryova
, so maybe that™s where I Œ my father
 found the work for me. And another 
thing he said, that time there came a 
Œ through Red Cross, a letter, which I 
reme mb er by heart. I™m okay. 
I only lack news about you.
 In Polish it was. And so  I 
hope that Œ that came b efore that, ab
out two or three months earlier. So Œ 
Q: Who was it from? 

A: From my  brother. Through Red Cross 
you can get the message like that, it™s 
open message. And it came to my  aunt, becaus
e he knew Œ he didn™t know that we 

were in 
Warsaw 
at that time. He didn™t know anythi
ng about us. We didn™t know Œ 
but th Œ for the first time we
 learned that he is alive. I always believed, but my  
parents thought that he didn™t Œ that he died.  

Q: They didn™t know th at 
he had been arrested. They
 didn™t know th at he Œ

A: He learn Œ my father learn about himbeing arrested when  he was in prison. 
Somebody apparently  was transferred from 
one prison to another. So  my  father 
learned there. Because we thought the he went to 
France
 and maybe he died there Œ 
Q: I see. 

A: Œ fighting with the Polish army. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But instead my father learn, and because
 of that, after he was released finally 
from Œ 

Q: 
Siberia
. 
A: Œ prison, he went and waited in 
Bia
ystok
 Œ 
Q: Your father. 

A: Œ because he thought that maybe my br
other will also come. But my brother was 
arrested half a year earlier. Almost half a ye
ar. So, he was already sent out to  prison. 
Q: So your mother, did she 
stay the entire war in this
 village, teaching in that 
school? 

A: Up to the first days of insurrection in 
Warsaw
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: In my Œ bef Œ well, first of all, my fa
ther Œ I thought that Œ about the father, you 
always think that he™s old. In ™43, he was 45. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
82
Q: Oh, that™s young. 
A: And he didn™t know wh at his only son 
did, but he took his 
daughter, me, in to the 
army. So I joined the a Œ jo
ined the army, I Œ my sole
mn  swearing was on the fifth 
of August, but much before th
at, I was already the messenger. 
Q: So you were in 
Armia Kryova
. 
A: 
Armia Kryova
. 
Q: And your s Œ and your swearing
 in was fifth of August, 1943? 
A: Yes, but I was much before that Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ because during the summer I was work
ing in  those ar Œ archives, and I was 
definitely at that time already in the 
Armia Kryova
. 
Q: So th at meant you were 15 year
s old, 16 years old, something Œ 
A: Sixteen. 

Q: Sixteen. 
A: Sixteen. 
Q: Sixteen. 

A: And so what I was doing, I don™t rememb
er. First of all, my fath er was at th e 
command of the 
[Polish]
. Middle force, it was divided 
into, I think four pieces. And 
he was in the second on in the 
comman Œ command of the second one. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
83
Q: Uh-huh. The second sort of area. 
A: And he was not the commander, he was in
 the comma nd. He Œ one of his things 
wa Œ jobs was taking care of the five messengers. 
Q: Okay . 
A: In between I was. 

Q: And you were one of the five? 

A: Wa Œ one of the five. And th e whole st
ructure, wherever it was possible, was the 
fifth, because you expect that if so mebody wi
ll be arrested a day or two, he may su-
survive the tre Œ 

Q: Torture? 
A: Torture. But you cannot count for always
. And because of that, if it™s only five 
people who know each other, then you 
can told this for disappear, because 
somebody is already there. And that way it was safer. 
Q: So, did any of the five th
at you were part of a group, did any of them get arrested 
by the Germans? 

A: No. 

Q: Okay . 
A: But one died, I have to tell you, because well Œ 
Q: Please do. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
84
A: Œ if Œ instead of me . But anyway, ju
st before the commander of that second 
[indecipherable]
, was Œ had tuberculosis. In a very 
bad shape, and he had to be in 
hospital. And of course, if someb o dy will 
say anything, so in hospital you cannot 
run away  from it. So, he didn™t have childre
n Œ he surv ived the 
insurrection. Only 
his wife, his second-in-command and I knew 
where he was. So if something were Œ 
messages to him were going th rough me. Beca
use if, for instance, my father did not 
know in hos Œ which hospital, nothing. So  he
 was safe. He went out of the hospital, 
I think ab out a month before insurrection.
 And my  biggest experience during the 
insurrection was, I was just trying to fi
nd out what Œ we know
 the date, but what 
day of the week it was. It was Œ insurrec
tion started Tuesday. And we have in the 
yard of the house wh ere was the command, 
we have the mass for 
soldiers. So it was 
not the first day. Is on a Su
nday then. And after that he 
came to me  and ask me, how 
do you feel in free 
Poland
? And I looked at them, I re
member that I did not know 
what to say, and I don™t remember wha Œ afte
r that I say. But finally I realize, this 
little piece of land is free 
Poland
. And for me the whole insurrection was because 
of that, I was in free 
Poland
. People were dying around me
, I could die as well, but 
the Œ the important thing is, we are already in free 
Poland
. That little piece is ours. 
And that changed my  whole lo
ok at the Œ peoples say trad Œ traged y, or something 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
85
like that. To me it was something, fight in free 
Poland
. And that™s what Œ what he 
said. 
Q: Who was this person who said that? 
A: He Œ he was the commander of the second Œ 
Q: Ah, th e one who had been  in the hospital? 

A: Yes, that™s one. 

Q: And so his Œ  
A: And under him there were 
2,000 people prepared. I lear
n later, from another Œ in 
his comma nd th ere were a man who was taki
ng care of something, as Œ I don™t Œ 
don™t know what™s the in command, in Œ in Œ in military, I don™t 
know. But he told 

me that there were two Œ 2,000 people in th at place. 
Q: Do you reme mb er his name, the commander? 

A: His sa Œ surname was 
Litvin
(ph). Oh, I™ll tell you later. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I Œ I know his name. And it happen
ed that after the war he was in 
Gdansk
 and 
my Œ one of my aunts was there, and they met. So

Abra movicz

Litvin
(ph) is his Œ 
Q: A pseudonym. 

A: Œ pseu donym. 

Q: Yeah. Actually, it so
unds like a Jewish name.  
A: I don™t think he was Jewish, no. 

Q: No? I heard that quite a few people were a part of the insurrection, the 
Wa rsa w
 
uprising, who were of Jewish background. 
A: Definitely yes. And I™ll have 
to tell you all about my little hero. 
Q: Okay, tell Œ 
A: Anyway Œ 

Q: Tell me. 
A: Œ I lived through the insurrection in that part of 
Poland

Wa rsa w
.

Warsaw

th rough th e nin Œ sewers.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
87
A: So it was the safest. But anyway, one da
y somebody was silly enough to say that 
all people who went from old city, wh ere the fighting was the worst, should sign 
that they Œ they knew
. And they  were gathering around the church. 
Q: They should sign so mething? 

A: Yes. They should be 
who surviv ed and so on. 
Q: I see. 

A: And Germans were flying over that, 
and people were co ming to  that. And we 
were supposed to work there, our five. An
d the top of our five was a chemist, and 
she came after her shift, sh
e came for me, and I was asleep. And she said, well, 
she™s so fast asleep, I™ll 
go back . And she died there. 
Q: She was bombed? 

A: They were bombed. Of course, when  
everybody is gatherin
g, it™s worthwhile. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So do you th ink was done on purpose? 
A: German did it on purpose. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, but the Œ the Œ 

A: No, no, that wa
s a silly comment.  
Q: I see. 

A: People are always silly.

Q: Unfo rtunately. 
A: Once I remember I was going so mewhere. 
There was a lot of blood on Œ and that 
was terrible, I never seen. There was somebody Œ we had 
[indecipherable]
 
something we Œ wh en you, ev
ery day you say Œ say ap ple,
 and you have to an swer 
pear Œ 

Q: Oh, you had a password . 

A: Passwords. 
Q: Okay .  
A: And somebody who came from old city, where the fighting was the worst, when  

they came through the sewers, which we
re Œ not everybody su rviv ed. And he 
thought, well, here is everything, you 
walk  like that. And somebody ask him at 
night, what it is the Œ 

Q: The password. 

A: Password. And he didn™t say. And th
e Œ the one who was asking was saying stop 
and so on, and he didn™t 
stop because it™s a safe way.
 And he was killed by th at. 
But, it was right, they never knew what it.
 So I was in the in
surrection up to the 
very end. And when  Polish people manage
d to get the Œ Germans called us bandits, 
but 
[indecipherable]
 they really had trouble with us
. We were prepared for, I think

three days of fighting and th
ree days of ammunition. I have to back then, year 
earlier, to Holocaust as well. 
Q: I want to talk about that. 
A: Yes Œ 
Q: I want to talk about the ghetto. 

A: Œ definitely. But here I Œ I wa
nt to go to Œ to my little hero. 
Q: Okay , come Œ 
A: We were sent to 
Sandbostel
, my mother and I, and my 
father as well. Then, the 
officers Œ 
Q: What is 
Ze n  B o s t o n
, what is that? 
A: The name in 
Germany
. 
Q: And what was it? 

A: The camp for Œ so ldiers camp. 

Q: So you™re talki
ng about prisoner camp . 
A: Prisoner camp. 

Q: So you™ve jump ed betw
een Œ you know, you had thre
e days of ammunition left? 
A: Well Œ 
Q :  A n d  th en  wh at h a pp en ed ? 
A: The insurrection was 63 days. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
90
Q: Yes. 
A: And at the end of that, Germans wanted to
 get rid of us, so they said, we are not 
bandits, we™re soldiers. And from that on, 
Germans treated us properly, definitely 
properly, because we were in 
Sandbostel
, somewheres and somewhere else. And 
my father, from that camp went to 
Murnau
, where is only for officers Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ also. And I don™t remember, but I th
ink it was before the Christmas that w e 
were sent to 
Oberlangen
.
 Oberla ng en
 is close to border of 
Holland
, with empty 
space all around us. And they sent one af
ter another, they sent women from other 

prisoners of war, which was definitely very
 safer for us. My fa
ther said that in 
Sandbostel 
they were Œ Polish men were prepared 
that if we will be freed, they will 
try to go at any place to our camp, our Œ 

Q: Area. 

A: Œ area, because there are men who are four or five years without women. So 
Germans took all the wo men. Before that they
 ask who wants to work  in th Œ in the 
country, or something. I think it was volun
teer everywhere, that m-maybe there was 
pressure on women, but definitely not pr
essure on the Œ physical pressure. No, not 

physical pressure, psychological pressu
re. Because a lot of women from the 
prisoner of camp went to wo rk somewhere. Bu
t we went, just sent to that one camp. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

Q: I want to interrupt you just for a sec
ond, just so that we have the chronology 
right. The uprising starts on Au gust 1
st
, 1944, correct? 
A: Yes. 
Q: It lasts for 63 days, which means that
 by early October it has been quashed, at 
which point you™re taken prisoner Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ and your mo ther is taken prisoner,and your father is taken prisoner. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Were you together at the time, all 
three of you, or were you separated? 

A: For a day or two we were togethe
r. We were marched, I think about 20 
kilometers to 
O
*
arów
, and then  in a very big camp, and then men was separated 
fro m wo men . 

Q: And then  you were Œ 

A: But we were taken as or
dinary soldiers, already. 
Q: And so then you were put on cattle ca
rs, is that right, on trains to go to 
Sandbostel
? 
A: Oh yes, yes.  
Q: Okay . 
A: That™s not comfortable, but is nothing. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

92
Q: So, when you get to 
Sa ndbo stel
, you are there for how long? 
A: Most likely before Christmas, but I™m
 not sure whether it before or after 
Christmas. Then we were taken to 
Oberlangen
, which was an empty space Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ with  only us. 

Q: Only  women. 

A: Only women, from a different ca
mp. I was in the 
second barrack. 
Q: And your Œ and th is was still done by th
e Germans together, and this was done Œ 
did you know why they  did th
is? What was the reasoning? 
A: Why they took all the women together? 
Q: And Œ yeah, and 
put them together? 
A: I™m thinking because th
ey thought that it was safe
r. They  was done properly. 
Q: I see. 
A: And we were even received three Œ three 
times I think, a parc
el from Red Cross. 
On-O nly three, usually it would be mo re
, food or something. On ce they sent 
hygienic things for women, and I learned then everybo Œ well, we had the little 

hospital there, for us, and so  it was useful
. But, mo re than half of women did not 
have the usual period, because of the Œ 

Q: Stress. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
93
A: Not only stress, hunger.  
Q: Oh. 

A: We were given fo od, but Germans didn™t 
have mu ch of that. We had to  work  in 
the kitchen for ourselves, so th
at™s all again Œ according to a 
Geneva Convention
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I cannot say that Œ someb
ody once said that it was a sp
ecial camp or something. 
It was the proper camp, they treated us pr
operly. We had to go out to bring the 
potatoes, but I had unusual smell, and they  as
k me very often, what is in this soup? 
And I would say that the soup is with salt,
 or without. Sometimes
 they didn™t have 
salt. I cannot say more salty or less, but salt,
 or without salt, I could smell it at that 
time. So they always ask me, I neve
r made the mistake. So you see Œ 
Q: That™s amazing. 

A: Œ it was so little Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ that Œ that Œ well, we were doi
ng everything. We could do during th e day 
whatever we wanted to. The restroom were
 outside, of course, not inside. And in 
one empty hut there was water broken, and 
even the winter ther
e, it was flowing 
there, so we would go ther
e, or something like that. 
Q: So the ice was broken, 
so there was some  water. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
94
A: No, it was broken, ne-nev er repaired. 
Q: Oh, you mean the fau Œ 

A: But it was an empty one. So we were 
Œ walked around, there were ma-maybe 10 
huts, and only four or five were occupi
ed. Altogether we were close to 2,000, I 

believe. So Œ 

Q: So how large was a hut? Ho
w many people fit into one hut? 
A: About 200. And it was three Œ well, three level of Œ 
Q: Well, they were huts
, rather than buildings? 
A: Of course, because Œ and 
we could wash at the end of
 the Œ but to the restroom, 
we would have to go outside. 

Q: I see. I see. 
A: But three levels, an d of course there 
were wood, and shins Œ wood planks, and in 
the middle of it, there was a stove. And of 
course, from time to time we took one 
plank. And so sometimes it was difficult to
 sleep, no, not to fall down, because on 
that we had 
shen-nikeetsa
(ph), big bag with straw inside.  
Q: Mm-hm. Okay. 

A: So Œ but Œ and how did I got the Œ it 
was close to Dutch border, I had wooden 
shoes, and for instance, one of my things 
was how to walk  at night. How did I walk 

to that restroom there on nigh
t, so nobody would hear it?
 Try to walk in the wooden

shoes. So th at was something wh at to oc
cupy me, when  we didn™t had any pers Œ 
anything, we learn history. I started to lear
n Œ I-I started to learn English before that, 
but we had one book. It was 
[indecipherable]
 something like that
, it Œ a some book 
on lowest level, about some mu
rder or something like that. 
Q: Like a detective novel or something? 
A: M-Most likely detective novel. But the three girls who we-were learning from 

somebody who knew th at, were on mu ch bette
r progress, so I was le arning what is 
here, there, at, and things like that. 
Q: So they were learning E
nglish from the detective novel? 
A: Yes, because we had that dete
ctive novel. And it™s still Œ in 
Sa ndbo stel
 we used 
to walk up and down  the corri
dor there. There we were in
 such a crowd that when 
we were sleeping on the floor, if we want
 to turn around, ever
ybody would have to 
turn around. But there was 
a corridor on which we could 
not walk during th e night, 
but during th e day. And I and tw o other gi
rls who were learni
ng English Œ English 
was not popular in before 
the war, only French and German. Russian, we had to 
learn later, but wasn™t popular. But anyway
, so we were talking the whole Polish 
sentence with one word English which we
 knew, not to forg
et. But then in 
Oberlangen
 it was already something like that. 
And of course if we were bored ,

and if somebody knew
 something about the subject, 
there was a conference about 
that and everybody would cool Œ 
come and so it was ordinary  Œ 
Q: Prisoner of war Œ 
A: Prisoner of war camp. 
Q: Œ camp. 

A: And definitely Germans treated Œ well,
 sometimes w e, if they couldn™t count 
correct Œ nobody run away fro
m the camp, I don™t think so
. But if they couldn™t 
count everybody, beca
use everybody would have to come Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ but somebody sick maybe, we could sta
nd fo r two or three hou
rs. But that™s the 
usual in camp. Opposite us, opposite this 
four or five huts, were the others, and 
there was that little hospital, which we ha
d for Œ and also, durin
g that morning and 
evening Œ 

Q: 
Appel
? 
A: Œ count of us, there were boys. There we
re soldiers. They were
 Œ the oldest one, 
mo st likely 12 or 13, and he would say, on 
top, march, look that, and so on, because 

they have to be counted. Th
ey were soldiers. 
In my hut, there were two sisters Œ 
Q: Also, prisoners of war. 

A: Yes, prisoners of war.

Q: Prisoner of war, too, okay. 
A: They were, definitely. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And in my  camp, I learned 
later that bo-both went to 
Israel
. We knew they were 
Jewish, we can hear a Jewish accent. It
™s a so me sort of accent, I don™t know 
whether I would be able to recognize right 
now. Jewish people had that accent, and 
the best educated had the best Polish, no 
accent at all. You hear the mu ch better 
pronunciation th at others. But the just or
dinary people had some sort of accent 
which we could recognize. They  definite
ly had, and th e older one looked  like 
Jewish girl. So Œ with the 
f-face. Nobody ever mentioned 
that they were Jewish, of 
course, because we never knew wh ether th
ey Œ even  as prisoner of war, whether 
they would not be taken out.
 And I was talking to that little one. I think that she was 
about 10. Apparently, she jo
ined the insurrection, and 
was a me ssen g er, as I wa s. 
And she said her biggest trouble was that
 when she was sent with messages to 
people 
[indecipherable]
 somewhere in there, and she should not ask people wh ere 
to go if she mistake it. And she could not
 read, so she was putting the message s in 
between her fingers to remember to whom
 she has to go and show, if she ge-get 

more. 
Q: She didn™t kn
ow how to read?

A: No. Apparently she was in
 ghetto. There was no schools. Because  she must have 
been Œ 
Q: Very little. 
A: Œ at least nine, but I think sh e was abou
t 10. And so that™s wa
s a soldier, that™s 
my little hero Œ hero. 
Q: Aye aye, aye aye. So she would in Œ 
because she didn™t kn ow how to read, she 
would put Œ 
A: She was putting in t Œ in between her fi
ngers to remember, because she could not 
ask somebody on the street. She would never 
know who is that person. So , what she 
did before, for that year, I don™t know. Ma
ybe she was singing in  the streetcars, or 
so on. There were some songs against Germ
ans, which the Œ the streetcars were so 
crowded, and nobo
dy would s Œ would 
[indecipherable]
 anything. What they did 
before, I did not ask. And apparently Œ I 
don™t think that she would be alone with 
her sister. I don™t know whether it was her 
sist er, they used the same name, last  
name. But they were so different. One 
was Œ my little hero was blonde, and the 
other one was dark. Everybody liked the 
little one, we didn™t like very much the 
other one. They completely 
different. Most likely they 
just lived together, maybe 
they were sisters, I don™t know. But defi
nitely Œ I don™t remember where I heard, 
there was a list of people wh
o Œ women who were in th e 
camp. But then with the

age, but I couldn™t find someones who woul
d be Œ I didn™t know exactly what their 
age. But le Œ 
Q: Were there more Jewish young women who 
were in the ca Œ in this prisoner of 
war camp? 

A: I don™t know definitely. I™m sure that 
there were more, but this two were in the 
hut where I was, and I Œ somehow I 
talked with that Œ that little one. 
Q: And do you reme
mber her name? 
A: No, I don™t. 

Q: Mm-hm. And the Œ and back in 
Warsaw
, during th e insurrection and even  
before in the resistance activities, did Œ 
did you see any people who were Jewish, 
who were part of these activities? 

A: No, I was not close to it. 

Q: I see. 

A: People in 
France
, for instance, people would 
be punished, but not us in 
Poland
. 
In 
Poland 
you mu st have heard ab out many peop
le wh o kept Jewish people hiding. 
And if they would find, the whole family, 
including small children, would be killed. 
I was not close to that. Now, I lived in 
Wa rsaw
, very close to ge Œ ghetto. 
Q: Tell me, what did you see there?

Q: When  you lived  close to the ghetto, what did you rememb er seeing? 
A: That I have to tell you, the ghetto was fi
ghting. First of all, there was a very big 
wall with the barb wire Œ 
Q: Barbed wire, yeah. 
A: Œ on top of that. I think eight feet, or 
something like that. On the other side I was 
walking very often

elazna

Q:

elazna
, mm-hm. 
A: And so th at was Œ and I think, but ri
ght now I don™t remember, b u t I think that 
the gate, very often before the insurrec
tion in Œ in the ghe
tto, the little children 
sometimes were walkinghere
 and there, maybe begging or something, and I think 
that Germans allowed that. 

Q: To walk outside the gate, into the Œ 

A: A little bit. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: A few steps. But I don™t really know 
whether I remember it right. I think that it 
was that it was possible.  
Q: Were you ever inside the ghetto? 
A: No, why? 
Q: Well, sometimes w h en you Œ 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

101
A: I wouldn™t get out. 
Q: Yeah. In the early days I have had some
 other people say there were streetcars 
that would go th rough, and so th ey could ta
ke the streetcar in. 
But that was in the 
early days of the ghetto. 

A: There was small ghetto and big ghetto. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I don™t remember n ext to 
)
ela zna 
where I was walking, whether that was big or 
little one, right. And in between there was a 
street, so you coul
d see it, and people 

could go from one ghetto to another over that
. And that was Œ now, one of them, the 
one which was farther away from me, star
ted to fight a few days earlier, I don™t 
remember. And then I was wa
lking Œ we were shocked 
[indecipherable]
 we knew 
that they cannot surv
ive, nothing will Œ there was a 
Polish underground and Jewish 
underground, there were some connection,
 but we didn™t have a lot of ammunition 
or anything, even for Œ for our-ourselves, so
 we didn™t have later. S o  we couldn™t 
help, we just had to look he
lplessly. And we were sorry, 
looking at Œ at people who 
were dying there. But on the very  beginning,
 on th at Œ that other ghetto, other part 
was fighting and this one not. When I was going through 
)
ela zna 
street, and over 
that big wall, I could see a woman Œ it was April, it was warm enough, she was 

looking through the 
window down there. They we
re not fighting. And sh e was 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

102
maybe even  smiling. She was definitely not
 Œ not horrified, not 
frightened. She was 
talking to  somebody with Œ it couldn™t Œ you couldn™t say joy, I Œ I don™t have the 
word for that. But I was horrified. How coul
d she be so calm, wh
en she is going to 
die pretty soon? Wh ere her people are dying? It took me a few years to understand 

that she was proud. She knew what™s waiti
ng for her, and I s Œ I still can see her 
how it was, and she took it nicely. She was gl
ad that Œ that they fighting and not Œ 
not allowing to be martyred by Œ by th emse
lves. It Œ it give me a Œ an impression, 
because we were horrified. 

Q: Well, that stayed with you. 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: That image has 
stayed with you. 
A: A few weeks or months later, my father Œ 
I used to go by streetcar next to all get 
Œ the ghetto was always closed to us, afte
rwards as well. There 
was streetcar, and he 
said, don™t go by streetcar today, not th
is one, because Germans put Œ hung some 
people and so high, so you could see it fro
m streetcar, and there were dead people 
there. So Germans weren™t nice to us. And we learn only that during the 
insurrection, that there was a pris
on th ere, and some people were Œ 
Q: Were hung? Were executed? 

A: Re-Rescued then.

Q: Ah, I see. 
A: And we didn™t know that
 there was a prison there. 
Q: Which prison was it? There™s a 
Pawiak
 prison, I remember. 
A: No, no, 
Pawiak
,
 
he was somewhere else. It was after Œ after ghetto da Œ it was Œ 
after the Holocaust Œ 

Q: I see. 

A: Œ there was a prison there. 
Q: Within the Œ within the area 
of what the ghetto had been? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: I see. Had you Œ you know,
 did people outside the ghetto
 know of the transports? 
That is that Œ 

A: On th e very beginning, we didn™t. I kne
w quite a lot because of my father pretty 
high position in  Œ in th e ar
my. So, for instance,
 when Russians were coming and are 
close to 
Wilno
, people were saying we™re 
Armia Kryova
. At first they were treated 
nicely, but then they were prison there, so
mething. So, before the insurrection, we 
knew already what was really
 expecting us, that unless we™ll be strong enough to 

get 
Warsaw
 before the Russians would come in, but
 they  stop, and they didn™t want 
the allies to  Œ to come in 
Lo ndon
, whatever, once
 more they Œ 
Q: Yeah.

A: Œ they did whatever they Œ 
Q: Excuse me for a second, we™v
e got people talking out here. 
[break] 
We™re going 
Œ we™re going to repeat some of the thi
ngs we were talking 
about now, because 
there was some background noise. I 
was asking you, did 
you know of Œ of 
transports of Jews outside of 
the ghetto, while you were in 
Wa rsa w
 proper. What 
was happening to them? 
A: Maybe later we knew. On the very be
ginning, nobody knows. Wh en ghetto was 
starting, some couple which were Christia
n and Russian Œ and Jewish, they could 
choose the Œ at least th e wife could stay
 outside. They usually would choose to go 
to ghetto together Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ because nobody expected that. They 
expected that people will be separated, 

but not that. Later they knew and mo st likel
y we know. But for qui
te a ti me Je wish 
people didn™t know that when
 there is a transport, the 
transport is to be killed. 
Q: So did you know the na
 Œ did the Œ did the terms 
Auschwitz
 mean something in 
1942 and 1943? Did the term 
Treblinka
 mean  so meth ing ? 
A: I don™t know when it™s come. B efore
 the insurrection, be
fore the ghetto up-
uprising, we already knew, but Œ 

Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
105
A: Œ how long before that, I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . Okay. 

A: Because we Œ we knew that German
 want to kill all the Jewish people. 
Q: So you did know that. You did 
know that there was Œ there was Œ 
A: But not on th e very beginning. 

Q: Okay . 

A: On th e very beginning we didn™t. 
Q: Did you ever, or did your father ever se
e any Jews being taken from the ghetto to 
the train station for such a transport? 

A: No, no, no, no. 
Q: No, no. 
A: And I never Œ well, walking around in th
ere, there was that gate. I never seen it, 
no.  

Q: Okay , okay. 
A: So, most likely they were already dr
iven  by so me Œ something. I don™t know. 
No. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So during the war I was not
 involved with a
ny Jewish peop Œ pe
rson trying to get 
away, or anything like that. I 
think that I knew the name of a person who was mo st

active in ghetto. If you say the name I will 
tell you th at, yes. But Œ so  we know that 
there is a underg round there, but we knew
 that everybody is helpless. The Œ our 
insurrection was prepared for three days
 only, because we didn™t have the 
ammunition for everything. 
Q: Oh, so when  you were te
lling me about three days, it 
Œ and it ended up being 63 
days Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: That™s what you were explaining. Got it. 
A: Yes. Some was tak en from Germans, so
me was Œ but very little from the Œ being 
thrown by allies, but not Russi
ans. The Russians, on the very
 end, helped and they s 
Œ threw some bread, I had some bread. 

Q: Oh really? Some bread? 

A: Yes. Completely dry. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: We were hungry, but it was the ammun
ition which we needed. And they  did not 
let the allies planes land on their side. And 
because of that there was a lot of people 
lost because of that.  

Q: So, were Œ were Œ 
A: Russians stopped, because they  wanted us to be killed.  

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

107
Q: Y-You mean the Russian 
forces were already at 
Warsaw
 and they Œ 
A: Close to 
Warsaw
 Œ 
Q: I see. 
A: Œ yes, and th ey stopped.  
Q: I see. 

A: The Œ 

Q: And had the Œ and were the insurrecti
ons, the people from the uprising, were 
they expecting the Russians to
 come over the Œ and help out? 
A: Definitely, because they 
were our allies. W e were not in good Œ in terms with Œ 
with them, because of 
Katy n
, and that time o n ly 
Ka ty n
, not Œ not the other camps. 
So it was broken without us, but I think 
[indeciphera b le]
 went to see 
Stalin
 just 
before that, and 
Stalin
 didn™t say anything. And no di 
Œ they were definitely wanted 
us to Œ to be killed off. 

Q: So tell me a little bit Œ I™d like to get 
a sense of how Œ by the time the news about 
Katy n
 was revealed, when
 the Germans found the site 
of the massacre of the 4,000 
Polish soldiers Œ Polish militar
y men, were you already in 
Warsaw
? 
A: I was in 
Warsaw
, I don™t remember when it was. 
Q: Do you reme mb er learning ab out 
Katy n
 in Œ wh ile you were in 
Warsaw
? 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
108
A: Straightaway, because we knew. The Germans allowed the Po lish Red Cross, 
because they wanted
 everybody to know 
what Russians did. 
Q: I see. 
A: So, there was all th e news we knew, and 
since people were k
illed in Œ with their 
all uniform, there were some pape
rs and things like that, so Œ 
Q: So th ey had iden
tification with them. 
A: Identification. We had not di Œ doub
ts that it was the Russians who did it.  
Q: And were you wo rking at the Red Cross 
when this news came in , or was this 
before that time? 
A: I think it was later, could have been
 later. I don™t remember when it was. 
Q: Okay . And you mentioned to  me earlie
r when we were not taping, that your 
father recognized so me names. Can you tell me about that? 

A: First of all, the Œ he was the first one to sign th at he wants to come back to his 

family. And Œ 
Q: That™s when he™s still in 
Lithuania
. 
A: In 
Lithua nia
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And then the first transport went out, a
nd he was not on th at, so he went back to, 
most likely the camp Œ Polish people in th
e camp , who signed him, and he said, 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
109
why not I should be? An
d then in the third one, I™m su
re that he knew the names, 
because there was a ter Œ transp
ort from there. I think that 
Katy n
 was not only from 
his camp, but from the others as well. 
Q: Course. 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know what the name
 of his camp  was, but definitely he was 
in the second transport, not the first one. 

Q: Okay , and so  wh en Œ wh en you learned ab out 
Ka tyn
 Œ 
A: We knew what it was. 
Q: Yes Œ 

A: Only then we learned, because 
we Œ before that we didn™t know. 
Q: Did he recognize some of the names of the people? 

A: Yes, he did. 

Q: I see. So when he Œ wh
en the identification list was 
made, he recognized that 
some of these people had been in  this camp with him? 
A: Yes, because he would not know that 
the Œ there was a thir Œ third transport. 
They  could be from everywhere, but he rec
ognized it Œ he knew that third one went 
there as well.  

Q: I see, I see. So there was no Œ no doubt
 in your minds that this was not just 
German propaganda, this was actually true. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
110
A: We knew, we knew, becau
se Germans wanted everyb
ody to know, and because 
of that they allowed the Red Cro
ss, Polish Red Cross to go there. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And recognize. And there were letters and 
[indecipherable]
. Yes, we knew. 
Q: So let™s go back to 
Oberlangen
, where you are, you know, you™re Œ you™re there 
with about 2,000 other women, prisoners of war, and it™s now like the winter of 
1945, the war is comin g  to an end. Did peop
le in the camp n Œ have that feeling that 
it™s not going to  be a lot Œ long now before it™s all over? 

A: Yes, we believe that. And it was funny 
incidents, there were people in Polish 

army under British command, and they stopp
ed not close to our camp, and Germans 
ask, why do you stop here for the nigh
t? Why your women are there? Because 
Germans knew. And so they went. I think we
 were rescued about five or six o™clock 
in the afternoon, beca
use they did not know 
that there was camps. 
Q: So you were liber
ated by Po lish forces? 
A: Polish forces, yes. 
Q: Oh, that must have been something.  

A: And that was before the end of the war, 
about a month, I think about a mo nth. It 
was April. 

Q: It was April?

A: Yes. 
Q: Aside from the time you were in free 
Poland
 in that little courtyard. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: This is when you were Œ what 
happened to you? Wh
at did Œ what Œ 
A: Well, after we learn in July that my 
s Œ mo st likely it was beginning of Au gust 
that we learned that he 
died, on 27 of July, we de
cided to  go and jo in our 
Anders™ 
Army
 in 
Italy
. And the detail Œ 
Q: Excuse me, I™m sorry. Yo
ur mother was with you in 
Oberlangen
? 
A: Yes, and my Œ 

Q: And where was your father? 

A: Œ father came. 

Q: To 
O b erla n g en
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay , mm-hm. 

A: Just to tell the news. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

112
A: And we went there, and it was the last
 month when somebody could still join the 
army. The 
Anders™ Army 
was mainly from 
Siberia
, but also quite a lot of people 
came who were taken to German army , and 
they would go th rough the Œ to Po lish Œ 
Polish people who were under 
the occupied person, and th
ey were forc
ibly joined 
the German army. So a lot of people came lik
e that, to them. But, since the war was 
over, they  was not taking any ne
w people. But Œ and at that time we could not go to 
England
. My brother was trying and 
didn™t before he Œ he died. And so  we™re Œ we 
were in 
Italy
. I was in 
Porto Sa n Giorgio
, and that was 
[indeciphera ble] Italy
. 
And there was a school for girls who didn™t
 finish. So th ere were some from the 
Polish insurrection, some were
 through ho Œ went thro ugh 
Siberia
. O n e o f  my 
friend was a tall, well-built woman Œ 
girl, at that time. S h e was in 
Siberia
, she was 
working in the forest
 cutting the trees. So that™s
 not exactly a woman job.  
Q: No. 

A: But otherwise we Œ we didn™t talk a lo
t. One was Œ mo st of them were driving 
trucks to supply there. And one of them 
said that when it was very hot, th-they 

would put wet sheets on th em to Œ to cool 
themselves. But otherw
ise they didn™t say 
how Œ 
Q: What their Siberian experiences were, huh? 
A: No, no. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

113
Q: Yeah. 
A: Nothing like that. 

Q: But it brought you all so much togethe
r, all these people w
ho had such different 
Œ different destinies, differe
nt hardships, different Œ  
A: And we didn™t talk about our experien
ces at all. It was the school and wh at Œ 
how to do it. And under the Œ under our sc
hool, there were food magazines. And so 

we had lo t of rats. And in 
Italy 
you have, in Polish it™s 
[indeciphera ble]
 it™s a sort 
of Œ something like a Œ a Œ over your bed wh en you sleep, so Œ 

Q: A mosquito net. 

A: Mo-Mosquito net.
 
And she put her leg out, and the rat bit her once. My other 
experience from there was I couldn™t sleep, I 
went there, and down  there, there was 
Œ we have military in 
Œ people who were taki
ng care of the food under that, and th Œ 
about us, and so mebody who was passing by
, another soldier, came and say, oh 
well, you have a good Œ so many women ar
ound you. And he th
 Œ the one who was 
there said no, there are good people, good women there. 

Q: So, in other words, there were people  who were looking at you in a different 

way. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
114
A: Well, some other people thought that 
well, when there are women and whatever 
happened . But no Œ no, it was Œ it was not
. And th e man who Œ who was there said 
so. So I heard it. But Œ 
Q: We Œ were these so ldiers? 
A: Yes, Polish soldiers. 

Q :  B o th  po le Œ  y eah . 

A: Polish so ldiers. 
Q: I-I have a question about Œ about General 
Anders™ Army
. Why would people be 
joining the army, his army, af
ter the war is over? What 
would have been the reason 
for that? 

A: We didn™t want to go to Soviet
 Pola nd
. 
Poland
 was not free. 
Q: So in  other word s, it would have
 been now to fi
ght the Soviets? 
A: Well, there were some Œ I think 
my daughter-in-law father was in 
Poland
 still, 
after the war, after the insurrection, and he
 was fighting th ere. How he got out, I 
don™t know, because we didn™t talk about 
those things. But he was one who was still 
fighting Germans and Russians and he Œ he
 was a Œ we did not fight Russians, 
because they were allies, so he was stil
l fighting Germans. And there were some 
people left and in 
Poland
 a lot was arrested and killed and so on. 
Q: By? 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska

115
A: It™s not Œ not Œ fo r us, the war did not
 stop there, even for somebody Œ we could 
choose to go out of 
Wa rsa w
 as a prisoner or war, or as
 a civilian. And many people 
decided to go as civilian. If 
they were found later by Russi
ans that they 
were in the 
underground army , they w
ould be arrested, killed. 
Q: I see. 

A: So Œ 

Q: So even thou
gh they were allies, having foug
ht in an underground army, they 
were threats. 

A: No, no.

A: After a year I wanted so much to go to 
England
 when my  brother was alive Œ we 
had to go to 
England
 and to be resettled. So I was 
in the camp there, and another 
year of school, and so I have my  
matriculation in  Po lish system. And Œ 
Q: So in  other word s, you, wh ile your brot
her was alive, he wasn™t able to get you 
to 
England 
Œ 
A: But then I had to Œ 
Q: Œ but after he died, you could go. 
A: I had to go. After a year, all the Polis
h soldiers were th ere, and tried to be 
resettled there. 
Q: I see. Was there any e
ffort to resettle you into 
Poland
? 
A: Whoever want to go, could 
go. And out of Œ we were in 
[indecipherable]
 this is 
Œ there were about 30 girls in 
[indecipherable]
. Two of them went. And if you 
consider that they were mostly young 
women, because it was the Œ we were in 

school, so it was from say 16 to  20, 
22, only two decided to go to 
Poland
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And that was why there are so many pe
ople stayed outside. We didn™t recognize 
the 
Poland
 as it was.

A: And I ne Œ I thought I send my ch
ildren when they were grown up, to 
Poland
. 
My oldest one, I told him, 
if somebody will ask you something, answer in English, 
not in Polish, so they will treat y ou as 
a foreigner. Because that was at the time 
when  it Œ it could be dangerous, I didn™t kn
ow. He was 16 at that time. But I never 
expected that I will 
be able to go to 
Poland
. So, we never expected that, and we Œ 
we didn™t expect that at our lifetime, 
P o la nd 
will be free. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But right now is still after 
Ukraine
, wh at would be next is 
Lithuania
, and 
Poland

Lithua nia
 and 
Poland
 are in 
Euro pe
 right now Œ 
Q: In the European Union. 
A: Œ and 
Ukraine 
is not. So, hopefully th
ey won™t be able to. 
Q: I want to ask about then your 
later, your parents, did they go to  
England
 with  
you? 
A: Yes, yes, because th
ey were in the army.

A: My mother was still teaching. Na Œ no

England

supposed  to help as an  ad
visor, even without the Englis

tuberculosis and a heart attack. He died
 on seven heart attack at that time.

Q: And this was in what year? 

A: That was in 
Lo ndon
. 
Q: And this was in the 50s? In th e 1950s or 1960s? 

A: That Œ it was Œ no, no, at ‚60 my  husband and I came to

But she could not wo rk without the langua

difficult to learn.

decade or mo re in pole Œ in  
England

Q: Okay . So Œ

and that was a college. An d my  husband 
still can Œ could go in Polish 
only. I had Œ I was a year la
ter, in English, and I was 
not good in English. I failed five times, so
 I didn™t finish it there. But I wanted to 

finish it, so when  I came to this country , there Œ in 
Eng land
 there is no Œ noth ing. 
How Œ you don™t call grades is
 Œ for each one you have one or two what Œ I lost the 
word, I™m telling you 
Q: It™s okay. So for Œ 
A: But anyway, I could not pass whatev
er I already learn in engli Œ in 
England

there. And I finish my  study, I have my  bachelor at 42. 
Q: Congratulations. Congratulations. 
A: It wasn™t easy. I just wanted to finish. 
Q: And he Œ he Œ was it Œ a
nd so if I understand it properly, it was that he was able 
to pass his exams in 
England
 in th e Po lish language Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ wh ich made it easier. A
nd by the Œ and you, co ming 
a year later, had to take 
those exams in English, even though you 
knew the subject matter. Then, because it 
was in English, it was hard for you to do. 
A: Well, I had to pass five exams. One 
was mo st likely mathematics; physics and 
something like that. Lab. And I was passing 
four, and th e fifth was English, which I 
could not pass. I think five times I failed. 

Q: I see. 
A: So th en I was studying by my self with th
e books, which Œ at home. But that gave 
me knowledge, but nothing. A
nd when we came to this co
untry t Œ first two years I 
didn™t do anything. And th en I join and Œ at 
University of Maryland
, my husb and 
was teaching there, we wer Œ lived in 
Mary land

Q: Wow. 
A: So I was really angry with that Œ them
. But later I was going to  get my  bachelor 
and then  fight by-laws with that. And 
[indecipherable]
 some Chinese or some body 
else did it before me.  
Q: Okay . 

A: So it was changed. But it was hard on 
us, because we didn™t have money, and 
here I had to pay a li Œ right now is very, 
very little, but it™s Œ it still was a lot for us.

A: Yes, we lived in 
Wa rsa w
 a few blocks away, but we met in 
England
. He went 
through the insurrection, through 
Italy
. In 
Italy
 he was studying at 
Turin 
University
. How he did, I don™t know, becaus
e he did Œ didn™t know span Œ  
Q: Italian? 
A: Italian. So maybe that™s where so
mething in English, I Œ I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But he Œ 
Q: And why Œ 
A: Œ was studying there for a year. 

Q: Œ why did you leave the 
U
.
K
. to come to the 
United States
? What was the 
reason? 

A: My husband started to study in  
England
, higher degree. Somebody advised him 
to Œ to go to  one place, and to do 
[indecipherable]
 engineering, and he finish 
master in engineering. And 
he hated if somebody will call him engineer. He wanted 
to study mathematics. And his professor in
 Polish university told him, you are too 
old for that. He finish, he got the doctor
ate in mathematics. 
And apparently, it was 
so well thought in th
is country about the degree he got in 
England
, that he went 
with somebody he kn
ew from one of the meeting of 
people with Œ whatever their 
interest. He took him 
and my  husband got seve
n offers of a job. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
123
Q: Wow. 
A: And he choose, like that, 
Maryland
, and we are in 
Mary land
 ever since. 
Q: Oh my. And you said 
you have six children? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And we talked about this
 a little bit earlier, but te
ll me, have Œ do your children 
know your story, your hi
story, your experiences? 
A: I know th at my  daughter once said so
mething was so Œ so out of reason. So 
apparently  we didn™t talk enough about it. 

Q: I see. I see. Do any of the grandchildre
n express interest or curiosity about these 
things? 
A: Sometimes I talk, but I think th ey do
n™t think it™s very important. I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . What would you want
 younger generations to un
derstand about wh at your 
generation went thro ugh, what your 
parents™ generation went thro ugh? 
A: Somehow I™m dissatisfied with people 
who right now go out 
and there™s no Œ not 
enough work in 
Poland
, so when they ca
n go anywhere in 
Europe 
to Œ to work, 
they do. I Œ they don™t really
 think of coming back. They  do
n™t think really that they 
should belong to  
Poland
 and not to be outside this. 
And it seems to me they™re Œ 
they™re a completely different generation. I lived in free 
Poland
, which was under 
150 years when we were not free. An
d right now some people are Œ in 
Poland 
are 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
124
mixed up, and th ey don™t recognize that 
they were not free under the Soviet 
occupation. There is a lot of progress in 
the country , as I Œ I think I mentioned to 
you that my  brother wanted 
to go on th e bicycle to Œ from 
Bia
ystok 
to 
Warsaw
. 
And that half of main road was paved and 
some half wasn™t. Right now, even in the 
village where my mother lived
 there, everything is paved.
 There is electricity. Right 
now there are a lot of trees, say cherry tr
ees, which are si Œ small. So it™s easy to 
pick. So  you have to Œ 
Q: They™ve been Œ 
they™ve been raised
 that way, yeah . 
A: Œ start Œ raised like not Œ not only it™s 
a different kind of cherries, not the big 
one. So  that had to be change, you don™t ch
ange it from year to year, you have to do 
it. And there, in that village where my 
mother was teaching, there was about 2,000 
people, and one Œ one with higher educatio
n only. So  education was allowed, but 
also some people were pushed, and th
ey sh ould not have the Œ that higher 
education. But definitely everybody ha
s the Œ much more opportunity. So, the 
villages went up, and because of that, so
me people from there don™t feel that we 
were not free for so many years. We 
Œ us being outside, 
we knew what was 
happening. They accepted whatit was, and it wasn™t a free 
Poland
. So Œ 

Q: And so you™d want people to have 
a Œ have a greater understanding of wh at 
freedom means. 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
125
A: Yes. And maybe it™s coming. So me people
 say that schools are not as Œ as good 
as it used to be. I know from my mo-mot
her that after we got independence in 
[indecipherable]
 the schools were Œ they were s
upposed to be like the schools in 
Switzerland
. That was the example for us. But my
 mother wa-was going with so me 
inspector, wh-w ho Œ who he was I don™t k
now, about once a year for three days, to 
different schools in the country, wh ere the 
teacher would have to pass an exam to be 
Œ 
Q: A teacher, yeah. 
A: Œ a teacher there. So some people we
re not very well educated, and the schools 
went Œ th e level of schools went up and ap
parently they  say that right now is going 
down . I don™t know why. 
Q: It happ Œ you know, the Œ it still is c
ountries in development, after Œ after such 
changes, it takes a while for Œ for 
systems to work, 
and to improve. 

A: Yes. There Œ right now th
ere are changes there Œ in 
Poland
, children start at 
seven, they start at six or something. 
And they  Œ I don™t understand what, but Œ 
Q: I wanted to ask Œ yeah. 

A: Œ something is not Œ not very  good. 
Q: I wanted to ask this question in a 
different way. What 
would you want young 
people, and younger generations 
from other countries: from the 
United States
, from 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
126
Canada
, from the 
U
.
K
., from 
Germany
, and even from 
Russia
, and from countries 
outside of the European  experience, what
 would you want the children of these 
countries to understand what you 
and your family, and the people in 
Bia
ystok
, and 
the people in 
Wa rsa w
 went through? What do you th
ink you™d like them to be able 
to get about that? 
A: I don™t think they would learn by themselves if the Œ if something will happen. 

But wh at I am not Œ people Œ other peop
le are always dissatisfied, I don™t like 
what™s right now common in the world that 
the countries are not religious countries. 

Poland
 was definitely Catholic country, but 
there was tolerance to everybody. And 
as I said, th-the kids who were going out of
 religious classes, they enjoyed that. And 
they could stay and learn. 
Q: Right. 

A: Not pray, but learn. 

Q: Right. 
A: And it seems to me that only religion, wh
en you believe Œ we believe in the same  
God, only different, and of course
, I Œ I believe it is better than 
[indecipherable]
. 
But is the same God. And peop
le need to Œ to believe in 
God, whatever it is. If they 
don™t know, they even  form 
belief that in several gods, or whatever, I don™t know 
what Buddhists believe, and so on. Bu t ther
e is a toleran ce, and it was tolerance in 

 
Interview with BarbaraSyska  
 
October 22, 2014 
 

 
 
127
Poland
. But here, right now, I Œ I Œ is my Œ my
 own saying, that et Œ atheists are not 
tolerant. They cannot tolerate cross so
mewhere on the street and somewhere. 
Maybe they feel guilty that 
they don™t believe in God, 
but I don™t see tolerance in 
this country, and everywhere. And 
Poland
 right now is Œ is se
parate of state and Œ 
and Œ and I think it™s going the same direc
tion, lack of tolerance. And I™m very 
dissatisfied with that, so I 
don™t know whether people can change it again, back  to 
religious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in 
Poland
, so me gathering, they  Œ they 
have the Œ right now they moved from east to
 west and so on, so it™s more difficult, 
but those people were Œ 
Poland 
was always fighting Turk s 
and Œ and Tartars, they 
were Muslims. So those people were taken 
prisoners, or were Œ 
they were always Œ 
they started as our enemies, fighting us. 
And right now we consid er them just any 
other people. We don™t have problem with Œ with Mu slims right now in 
Poland
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But we are tolerant to any religious, a
nd it seems to me that if Œ  well, with 
Muslims it™s difficult b
ecause not all of them
 are Œ are fighting. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: But it seems to me I would like young peop
le to believe that religion is the base 
of the social work. 

Q: Okay .
