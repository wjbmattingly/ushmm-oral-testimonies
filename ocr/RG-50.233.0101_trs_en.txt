Q: How ma ny?   Does she reme mber how ma ny?  

 

A: There were eight of us in the fa mily. There we
re only two or three Jewish fa milies ther e. When 
they took our fa mily, we were the only ones.  
We  didn™t see anyone else. They took us, and led 
us out of the village. They said we weren™t goi
ng to walk any further, and they began shooting, 
so that the people in the village 
would think they had killed us .T
hey shot into the air. And we 

were thinking they were going to shoot us.They
 took us at night to some  house, and we were 
thinking again that they were going to kill us. 
 His mother and father, were crying, and saying 
goodbye to us–we thought they were going to kill us .  It turned out that they weren™t bad 

people, they didn™t kill us.They took us for three days to a camp. We  had no food, no water, 

nothing. They put us in
 a ghetto, in Saroka. 
 

Q: How far was  that? 

 

A: Ve ry far. We  walked for three days. We  ha
d nothing, not even water. They took us into some  
synagogue. There were probably a 
thousand people there. They were all sitting there, like 
this–There was a well, but the soldiers 
were surrounding it, and wouldn™t give any 
water–whoever wanted water, they would–The
re was a second level in the synagogue, and 
they would urinate on the heads 
of the people below. We  coul
dn™t even raise our heads–they 
ma rched us from one village to another, fromone place to the other. There were 1,000 people, 

ma rching in columns. Whoever couldn™t walk was shot. 
 

Q: Did they know where they were taking them?  

 

A: No. We  didn™t  know. We  walked so long, 
and there was a lot of rain.  Such rains–

Q: Can I ask a question? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: You said that–Do you reme mber when the–
Now the Romanians took you, not the Germans, 
right? The Roma nians ma rched you to Saroka. 
 

A: Romanians.  But Germa n commander was with them. 

 

Q: So the Romanians are still ma rching you away from Saroka in July? 

 

A: They drove us fr om village to village. Then we got to a forest -- Kosauts. All the people were 

there. We  were there in the forest for six weeks, 
in tents. There, the soldiers would take girls at 
night, and beat them wit h–raped them.  Every night
 there were such screams.  It was terrible.  
From Kosauts, they drove us toVe rtuzhaniye. 
 
Q: Back to her home town? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: We re they feeding them in the woods? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: They had to find food for  themselves? 

 

A: There were people from the village. They
 brought out stuff. Moldavians brought food.  
Whoever had some thing to sell would 
sell it, but I didn™
t have anything. 
 

Q: How did she get food? 

 

A: We ll, if someone had some thing, th
ey mi ght give me  a piece to eat. 
 

Q: And she was still pregnant at this time? 

 

A: Ye s.  InVe rtuzhaniye, I gave
 birth on the floor, without anythi

Q: I™m sorry–take your time. 
 

A: From there–fromVertuzhaniye, they marched us 
to theVi netsk District.  In aboutAugust.  It 
was already fall.  It rain
ed.  It was cold.  I didn™t have anyt
hing on my fe et.  I went barefoot. My 
baby died on the way–then they ma rched us 
to Bershed, then to Obudovka.  Finally, to 
Turkanivka. 
 

Q: And that™s where it finished? 

 

A: They ma rched us there. They took us to wo
rk in the kolkhozes.  I wo
rked in the kolkhoz.  I 
cleaned beets, dug potatoes, wheat. Then they put us in a pigsty. 
 

Q: Does she reme mber how far, she marched all 
this way, from her hometown --Ve rtuzhaniye.  
How far was that from there toTurkanivka? 
 

A: Ve ry far, I don™t know. We  walked all day. Then I went to the kolkhoz to work. They put up 
barbed wire around the camp. We  ha d to wear badge
s. Ye llow badges.  St ars.  Jewish St ars.  
No numbers. If you were caught without this, th
ey could beat you. We  were all supposed to 
wear the star.  In the camp, very ma ny people di
ed.  100 people died from hunger.  It was cold.  
There were no windows, or doors. There 
was nothing, it was a pigpen.  Pe ople froze. 
 

Q: This was in late 1941? 

 

A: 1942.  It was afterVe rtuzhaniye–the pigpen. Vine

even more than a year. 
 
Q: So when she™s talking about very cold, duri
ng the winter, when she stayed over there?  From 
that– 
 

A: Ye s, yes.  It was very cold. We  got straw, bur
ned it. Tr ied to get warm that way. And the rats 
ran over us.  Rats this big–and we didn™t have 
anything to eat. We ll, when the kolkhoz was 
harvesting beets, we collected 
beets, and baked them. That way, we were able to feed 
ourselves. You know -- sugar beets? 
 

Q: Can I ask a question about the camp?  
You said that you worked on a farm? 
 

A: I worked wherever they se nt me . Ye s, a farm. 

 

Q: So, they were held in a camp, that was surround
ed by barbed wire. And then taken out to work. 

 

A: They took us to work. The told us to report 
some where, then we would work awhile, then back 
to the pigpen. They kicked us out of the camp t o go to work, and then locked us back in to 

sleep in the pigpen. 
 

Q: She said that she was there for a year. What happened after that? 

 

A: I got very sick there.  I had typhus.  I fe
ll ill, and lay in the pigpen.  People lived here 
(showing), and went to the bathroom over there (
pointing).  I didn™t know, and I fell over there.  
I lay there, and one woman fell 
over my leg in the night.  I m
oved -- she thought I was dead.  I 
lay there among dead people. Then they dragge
d me  out of there–no–it 
turned out that they 
knew my pa rents -- they took me  awa y–In this bar
n, the space was divided 
into little lots, one 
fa mily here, another over there. They took me  in, 
let me  stay with them.   I forgot to say that 
when they took me  to work, they sent my husba
nd™s parents to a different place -- to Obadovka 
-- a different camp. I was  left inTurkanivka aloe, th
ey were sent away. All the time  I was alone.  
And I never saw them again. They died there, 
in the other camp. The ones who picked me  up 
knew my pa rents.  I was like a me mb er of their family. 
 

Q: What was the name of the family? 

 

A: Weissman.MelaWeissman. 

 

Q: Did she get better, or was she still sick at this time? 

 

A: It was a whole year–I crawled on my knees.  I 
wa s like a baby–I couldn™t  walk. Then, after a 
year, I got well.  It got wa rmer
, there was no snow–I got better. 
 

Q: Now this is still in the camp, near the farm, right? 

 

A: In the camp, inside the barbed wire. Then
 they allowed us to take–.There were only a 
hundred people left out of a thousand. Even 
more than a thousand. All had died, and– 
 

Q: Now these were the thousand people who 
had left from the synagogue in Saroka? 

 
A: Well, from different gathering pl aces. 

 

Q: But, over a thousand came  to this cam
p, and only a hundred were left after a year? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah–they buried 50 
people every day in the camp. Then they allowed us to take 
an apartment somewhere–to live. They let us ou
t of the barbed wire, to live somewhere in the 
village. We still wore the Jewish star. 
 

Q: But were they guarded, they were just allowed–? 

 

A: They already had stopped guarding us.  But, we had to go every time to theVillage Hall. There 
were Germa ns, Roma nians there–we  all had to 
go there. They took the me n to work loading 
wheat into trucks---without pay.

We  worked on the kolkhoz, or wherever. When the 
war ended, that™s when they released us. When
 was that, 1944?   Oh, the war hadn™t ended, but 
the Roma nians came in and let us go, in 1944.

the barbed wire to go to th
