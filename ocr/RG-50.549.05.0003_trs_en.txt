some thing about your family™s history in the area of Bia

A: My father™s name  was Josef 
(ph )
 and my mother™s name  was Chaya 
(ph )
.  I was born, I was the 
fifth child; we were eight childre
n.  I was one of the youngest.  We  
were four girls, four sisters 
and three brothers and one was a twin.  I was the,
 one, two, three, four...  I  was the fifth child, 
like I said before.  And I had a very healthy, ha
ppy upbringing.  My mot her was in business.  My 
father, at that point already, coul
dn™t work because he was sick, so he used to help in the house 
with the children and he helped 
Mom in the business.  And we we
re loved, getting along sisters 
and brothers, very good.  And it was 
great.  I went to school.  My 
mother always believed in a 
private school.  She never believed in a public 
school.  So, we were taught Hebrew and Yiddish 
and Polish. 
 

Q: What was your mother™s business? 

 

A: Food business.  We  had a food store. 

 

Q: You had a shop?

A: A shop, yeah food store. 

 

Q: Did you live near your shop? 

 

A: Not too far, within walking distance, not too fa
r.  And my mother was a 
very devoted mother.   
 

Q: What was her ma iden name ?  

 

A: Her ma iden name  was R osenberg. 

 

Q: Rosenberg? 

 

A: Rosenberg,RO 
S E N B E R G.  
 

Q: Okay, okay.  What were your brothers™ and sist
ers™ name s, starting with
 the oldest and moving 
down to the youngest? 
 

A: My oldest sister was Itga 
(ph )
, the second one was Shayna 
(ph )
 and the third one was Fulma 
(ph )
.  In between was a boy, his name  was Mihal 
(ph )
.  And then I came  and my na me was 
Jospe.  And then I had a brother, Ab
raham.  And then there wa s Mischa 
(ph )
 and, uh, what was 
my sister™s name , the youngest, the twin?   Fega 
(p h )
.  
 

Q: Okay.  So, the two youngest were the twins? 

 

A: The two youngest were the twins, yes.  And it wa
s a very happy home .  I had a grandmother that 
lived with an aunt in the same  building.  And 
we  were always playing together, my aunt™s 
children and us.  And never had a problem.  It was a very happy house.  My mother used to tell 

jokes and did birthdays and everything for the 
kids.  She was a very hard working woma n.  
People used to say that I looked li
ke her and I care like her.  It 
was never a dull mo me nt, all this 
happiness. 
 

Q: Was your family religious? 

 

A: I would say not orthodox, but
 conservative, conservative. 
 

Q: They go to services every Saturday? 

 

A: Not every Sa turday, no.  Holidays mostly.  If some thing special came up, but I wouldn™t say 
every Saturday, no.   
 

Q: And can you say some thing about your father and his, what he was like? 

 

A: My father was, I could only say my father ne
ver hit us.  He didn™t know
 what me ans.  He had 
patience.  He was very good to us.  He was like pl
aying the part of the mother, because my father 
was in the– he had– he used to ma ke skins. 
 But this didn™t– he couldn™t carry this on, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

3
because he had problems breathi ng, had a weak heart. 
 So he couldn™t continue to doing that part.  
So, that™s when he had to quit his work and he
 stayed home with the children and helped out 
Mom at the store.  He wa s a very lovable ma
n, good, caring, very caring for the family.  He was 
not born in Bia
ystok.  He was born in Sokolka, which is 
not too far.  My mother was born in 
Bia
ystok.  And we were surrounded, always, by love
 and by friends and by fa mily.  We  didn™t 
know from a ny hardships because we always had what
 to eat, being my mother was in business.  
And we got along with everybody.  That™s it. 
 

Q: What language did you speak in the home ? 

 

A: We spoke mostly Yiddish with the parents a
nd then Polish, of course, 
in the streets and the 
school.  And Hebrew. 
 

Q: Was it an all Jewish school that you attended? 

 

A: Yes.  Yes it was. 

 

Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in
 Poland before the wa r began, in Bia
ystok? 
 

A: I had very little– the only time I experienced 
is when, the ghetto, when we were in the ghetto.  
Otherwise, I really didn™t, because we were, like
 I said, I went to Hebr
ew school and my friends 
were mostly Jewish.  But the neighbors on the 
block, just enough to sa
y a hello and good-bye 
and they had their life, and we had our life.  I 
never had any problem.  My father used to have 
problems, because he used to love soccer and ev
ery Saturday they had a soccer game .  And after 
we finished our lunch, we  used to go.  But he 
alwa ys took along a cane, in case they hit him or 

they throw stones or whatever.  If the game – if
 t hat team lost, you couldn™t get home, because 
they used to be very ma d.  And that™s what they
 used to do.  They used to throw stones, hit you, 
so he always took a cane along with him.  But he
 wouldn™t mi ss a game .  He loved it.  He loved 
that spor t.  And that™s it.  Mo
m took care on the kids, he was at
 home and that™s what it™s all 
about. 
 

Q: What did you, did you and your fa mily– were you aw
are of Hitler from t he time that he rose to 
power in Germany?   And did you feel threatened by what was happening in Germany? 
 

A: Actually when you heard the stories, wh
en you heard what™s going on– we, of course you 
started to get scared, but we 
didn™t know so much what, what
™s going on.  And my father, ma y 
he rest in peace, always said, he
 was a medic in the First World War and he always says that the 
Germans wouldn™t do that.  They ma y put you to wo
rk, but they will never harm you in any way.  
And like anything else, you listen to your parents, 
whatever they told you.  I mean, you didn™t 
have much of a chance to run any place.  We  wer e  on the– in our town, first came in the 

Russians.  And we were with the Russians ma ybe a year.  And we were on the– they evicted a 

lot of people that were in business for themselves.  So, they put us on a truck to go, I don™t know 

where, to Siberia or  whatever. 
 

Q: The Russians did?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

4
A: Yes, the Russians did that, because my mother
 had a house and we had a store, so we were 
already like, rich, you know
 what I™m saying?   So that™s wh
at happened.  And my mother gave 
them some  money and they took us off the truc
k and we remained home.  Had we known what 
was going on, that we wouldn™t stay
 home , of course we would ha
ve gone to Russia better.  But 
that™s what it was.  And then a year late
r, this was 1939, when the Germans came in.  The 
Russians left  and the Germans ca me  in.  And wewere with them for a while from  the beginning, 
then they started to ma ke  all kinds of things
.  When the me n went to the Temple, like on a 
Saturday, they burned down the whole Temple with
 the people inside, whoever it was there.  
Then one Saturday they took away all the me n. 
 They left the women, but all the men.  And 
that™s when the trouble started.  A 
while later, they put us into the ghetto and this was terrible.  
The ghetto was terrible.   
 

Q: Okay, before we get to that, I wanted to as
k you a little bit more about
 the time before the war 
started.  Wh en the war started it was 1939, you were
 about sixteen years old?   Is that right? 
 

A: Yes.   

 

Q: Can you tell me  some thing about what your 
interests were?  I mean you were a young woma n, 
you™re just comi ng into your...  you™re getting cl
ose to adulthood.  Can you take me  back into 
that time and just recall 
what your life was like? 
 

A: Well, like I said before, I have
– I admi red my s i sters.  I always
 looked up to them.  My oldest 
sister was a designer.  She was ve
ry good at it.  She used to design for me  clothes.  She used to 

ma ke me  dr esses.  My second sister, she was in
 the house.  My third one, she loved school, but 
she was sick.  And I always used to complain to 
Mom, that she™s– takes advantage of me .   She 
hits me .  Wh atever she has, I cannot have it.  
Li ke we used to come  from school on a Friday.  
She wanted some thing special.  She wanted some
 kind of pastry and sh
e always got it.  And 
milk, she did not want it to eat, but it was in the 
house.  I was forced to
 eat everything, whatever 
they cooked for me .  And I rebelled.  And I came to
 my Mom™ s store.  This was after months.  
And I came to my Mom™ s store and 
I started to cry.  And I said to
 her, ﬁWhat™s going on?   You 
don™t love me.ﬂ  I mean, what could a child thin
k?  I don™t know how old was I, ma ybe seven or 
eight.  And I said, ﬁYou don™t love me.ﬂ  I says, 
ﬁHow could you say that to me ? ﬂ   My mother 
said– I said,  ﬁYou see, you yourself said when Fulma touches me –ﬂ in other words, she gives 

me  a –  
 

Q: Apinch? 

 

A: A pinch, exactly, I was looking for that.  And that
 place hair wouldn™t grow
, that™s what she used 
to say, because she was strong in her hand.  And wh
en I would go to school with her, she has, 
she walks and I run, and I couldn™t 
catch up with her.  ﬁSo, how could you tell me  that she is sick 
and I am we ll? ﬂ   ﬁOh,ﬂ my mother said, ﬁOh, I s
ee you have already brains.ﬂ
  I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ  She 
says to me , ﬁHow ma ny fingers
 do you have? ﬂ   I said, ﬁWha
t are you talking about?   Everybody 
has ten fingers.ﬂ  So, she said, ﬁIf you hurt one
, if you cut one, does it hu
rt you? ﬂ  I said, ﬁOf 
course, what kind of talk is that? ﬂ   That™s wh
en she sat me  down on her 
lap and she explained it 
to me .  ﬁI love you all the same , but she happen 
to be sick, that™s why she gets everything.  I 
don™t want to upset her.ﬂ  So, ag
ain, I said, ﬁI don™t believe you.  How could you do that to me ? ﬂ

So, she said, ﬁ Watch.ﬂ  She had, what do you– now it™s going to come  back to me .  I™m getting 
all excited.  Epilepsy.   
 

Q: Oh, mm h mm.  

 

A: And most of these things happened during the ni
ght and I never saw it.  So when she told me  
that, I trusted her, my mom.  But I– still I had to
 see it for myself, that kind of child was I.  And 
sure enough when the light came up and I used 
to see everybody running to her bed and foa m 
came out of her mouth.  And from then on, you c
ouldn™t do nothing to her, she was the best 
sister.  She couldn™t be  wrong in a
ny place.  I looked into her eyes
. This all I have to thank my 
mom, that she explained it to me  properly, becau
se otherwise I would grow up hating her, how 
she dared do that to me .  That kind of mo m 
we had, very smart and outgoing in every way. 
 

Q: What was the sister™s name  again? 

 

A: Shayna.  She was the third one and I was under her.  And– 

 

Q: What were your interests?
  Did you have any dreams?  
 

A: My interest?  To go school.  And that™s what it 
was.  I didn™t have any other ambitions, but to go 
to school at that point, because I had older sist
ers to care for.  You know what I™m saying?   We  
didn™t jump to any conclusions ahead.  That™s th
e way we were raised.  
My oldest sister got 
ma rried.  And she had two children.  The other 
sister got married in 
the ghetto.  And my 
brothers, my  brother got ma rried in the ghetto. 
 And they all had child
ren in the ghetto.  And 
that™s what it– it was kind of hard on us.  And my sick sister, she too got ma rried in the ghetto 

and she had a baby. 
 

Q: Had you started dating by the time  the war started? 

 

A: Not dating, actually not dating, 
just having friends.  We  used
 to belong to organization, and– 
Zionist organization. 
 

Q: What was the name  of it ? 

 

A: Jabotinsky
1
?  Would you know?   Mm hmm.  Yes, yes, yes.
  And that™s– we used to be together, 
like, and go on, you know, like hikes and things 
like that, but of c
ourse, everything was 
supervised.  And that™s it. 
 

Q: Okay, now tell me  a little bit more about the Russian occupation.  The way I understand it, it 
started in 1939.  The Germans occupied fo
r a week and then the Russians came in. 
 

A: Uh huh.  They were more than a week.  They were there for ma ybe a year.

Q: After the– so the Germans came in, and then th
ey occupied just for a little while and then the 
Russians occupied for– 
 
A: No, just the opposite.  First were the Russian
s, first were the Russians and then came the 
Germans. 
 

Q: The Germans returned and occupied 
again and establishe
d the ghetto later on. 
 

A: Right.  Uh huh, right. 

 

Q: During that time  that the Russians were o
ccupying, you me ntioned that
 your– did your fa mily 
actually lose their stor e? 
 

A: Oh yeah, we lost everything, yes.  Yes, at that time.  Short time after we went into ghetto. 

 

Q: And what, how did you feed, how did your fa mily
 support itself during that time , before the 
ghetto, that it lost
 t h e  st or e?    
 

A: Before the ghetto, I, it wasn™t a long time, le
t™s put it this way.  We  didn™t feel the pinch in 
anything, because like I said before, my mother
 took care on everything.  In the ghetto we felt 
the pinch, yes, definitely, but not before. 
 

Q: Do you remember when the Germans came in and occupied Bia
ystok? 
 

A: Oh sure, oh sure. 

 
Q: Can you tell me  about that day? 
 

A:  The day, we heard planes comi ng back and fort
h and they threw bombs .  We  were right, not far 
from there.  And we still thought that they we
re pr acticing.  The Russians are practicing because 
we didn™t believe that this was the Germans al
ready.  A short time after, you saw already riding 
on the motorcycles, you know, and comi ng into town and that™s what it wa s.  And that™s when 

the trouble started. 
 

Q: Were they brutalizing the Jews of Bia
ystok? 
 

A: What?  The Germans? 

 

Q: TheGerman s. 

 

A: Of course, of course.   

 

Q: Did you witness any brutality?   

 

A: I mean, thank God, we were lucky at that po
int, that nobody was mi ssing from the fa mily, but a 
lot of people didn™t have their hus
bands already.  They took them a w
ay, or their sons.  They used 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

7
to pick them up from the street and, and take them
 out.  But at that point, we were yet, the whole 
fa mily was together yet, until the, the selection th
at they ma de.  That they put us into the ghetto 
and I had to go out to get some  food, because 
nobody else coul d.  My brother wouldn™t go out, 
he was afraid.  And so my father couldn™t carry a
nything, so I used to take off the yellow star that 
we wore.  And I was blond.  And I took it off a
nd I went out through the– they had like a hole 
they ma de.  And I went underneath and I went to
 the Poles, the ones that used to do business 
with my mother.  And I used to buy from them pot
atoes.  And I used to bring it in underneath 
the– on the way back, the same  wa y like I came 
out.  And I did it quite often for the fa mily, 
they should have what to eat.  
 

Q: How did you get money to buy the food?   Wa s that saved from before? 

 

A: Oh, money left, we had money from 
before.  Yeah, money we already had. 

 

Q: So, it wasn™t taken away 
when you went into the ghetto? 
 

A: No, no, no.  No, the money, at that point, 
they didn™t take nothing.  When we came into 
Auschwitz, that™s when they took everything aw
ay.  You hid it, you know, in certain places.  
You know, you prepared yourself.  But at 
that point we still had money.   
 

Q: Can you tell me  a little more 
about going into the ghetto.  What 
were your living 
quarters like?   
Or do you reme mber, how you were...  do you even reme mbe r  being informed that you had to 

move and what your family™s response was to that? 
 

A: Yes.  Like I said before, I was not of the ones 
that listened into everything.  I had older ones than 
me , listening in, you know, but you followed whatever
 they, they told you. 
 It was one bedroom 
that we had in that– in the ghetto.  And that™s 
what everybody was together.  But my sister, my 
oldest sister and my– my oldest 
sister and my second sister, they were ma rried already and they 
had babies, so they couldn™t go with us when we we
re hiding, because they were afraid that they 

going to give  out.  Because if the ki
ds start crying, the SS will hear.   
 

Q: You were hiding in the ghetto or before? 

 

A: This is the last time , before they, they ma de
 those selections, so we were in the ghetto.   
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: From there they took us, they took you out. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And that™s from there where they took you.  First 
they put you all into a 
ghetto, in order to be 
easier for the Germans, that we should be all toge
ther.  And that™s exactly what happened.  They 
took– so we were separated.  My mo m went w
ith the– with the younger ones, the ones that 
had the babies.  And my father we
nt with the older, like me  and 
my brother, that had no children. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

Q: Okay, before we go on– I definitely want to hear
 about that, but I wanted 
to focus on the time  in 
the ghetto and going into the ghetto.  So just onthat early time, right as you were going in, did 
your whole entire family, beside
– go into that same  bedroom?  
 

A: You had no alternative.  Now my oldest sister
, she was ma rried;  she had two children.  So she 
went with her husband, but not too fa r.  And my
 other sister was not 
with us already.  And 
neither did my brother, because 
he was ma rried.  So, it was just the younger ones, that we were 
all together.   
 

Q: Five children, five children and your parents. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Yes, yes.   

 

Q: In that bedroom.  

 

A: In one bed, yes, yes, yes. 

 

Q: And when you were in the ghetto, did you work in any way? 

 

A: No, I never worked, no.  No, I never worked. 
 I was going– I didn™t go to school already then, 
because you weren™t allowed to go already.  But I 
was home  with my parents, because I had to 

watch them. 
 

Q: Do you remember the, the– 

 

A: It was a lot of things on my head.  Let™s put 
it this way, because I knew my father was sick and 
they had to get certain things a
nd I had to– I had to be the one to go out and get it.  So, every 
time you, one of you we nt out, you wasn™t sure if
 you were going to come  back, but I would 
never say no.  Never. 
 

Q: So, you were the ma in, of the children 
that were left with your parents– 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: –you were the ma in caregiver? 

 

A: Right.  Caregiver.  Not God forbid that it wa
s sick, bedridden.  But as far as providing food, and 
I reme mber my sister was having a baby in ghetto. 
 And at that point alre
ady, they wouldn™t take 
no money, the doctors.  So, I had to go get the doctor
.  My mother sent me , 
so I went, of course.  
And he came.  And I had to be the one to, to stay
 with them in the room.  They chased off my 
mom, everybody from the room and she was having the baby.

Tape 1, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with
 Justine Lerner .  Okay.  You were telling me  a little 
bit more about the ghetto.  Did any of your brothe
rs or sisters do any work in the ghetto, in any 
of the ghetto industries?   
 

A: None of them.  None of them
, no.  No.  No.  My brother, lik
e I said, didn™t go out, out of the 
ghetto, you know.  And of course neither did my  fa
ther or my mo m.  The  only one that I went 
out, and I used to bring in the provisions, whatev
er, whatever it was able 
to, ma inly potatoes and 
flour.  Sugar, my mother, she knew that some
thing™s comi ng up.  So, the main doctors didn™t 
take, if you needed a doctor, money was no 
good, because they couldn™t buy nothing for the 

money.  The ma in thing was sugar and flour.  And 
that™s what she saved up a lot of it.  So, she 
paid the doctor, when my sister
 was giving birth, that™s what 
it took, is sugar and flour.  And 
none of them worked, no, no. 
 

Q: Was it frightening to be sn
eaking in and out of the ghetto? 
 

A: Yes, it was, let™s put it this 
way.  I had no fear.  I knew I had to
 do it, because I could not give it 
over to some body else.  It was my job and I did it ve
ry, very nice.  I went out, like I said before, I 
wasn™t sure if I™ll ever get bac
k, but that™s it.  You have to do
 what you have to do.  And I was 
always successful.  I went in 
the same  way and I came out the same  wa y.  And that™s it.  The 
fa mily was happy and I was happy that I was able to do it.   
 

Q: Did you have any close calls? 

 

A: Not in the ghetto.  I was fine.  In the camps, yes,
 but not in the ghetto.  In
 the ghetto I was fine.  I 
went in okay and I came out okay.  And it™s not 
like– my mother made meals and we ate and– 
the best she knew how, I mean whatever she ha
d left, you know?   But we
 never felt hungry or 
anything like that.  
 

Q: Were you aware of any organized, unde
rground resistance in
 the ghetto?    
 

A: No, no really don™t– we were, we didn™t, we
 didn™t– how do I say?   We  didn™t mi ngle with 
people, you know what I™m saying?   Because we 
were a clos e fa mily, and we were mo stly by 
ourselves.  But I knew that people were working 
for the Germans, but we didn™t know how could 
they do it!  You understand what I™m trying–?   
How could they do a thing like that?  When I 
came to the, when I came to the concentrati
on camp, to Auschwitz, then I saw what was going 
on.  Up till then, I did not know.  Like I said be fo
re, my father always used to say the Germans 
are educated.  They wouldn™t do th
ings like that.  The only thing 
they could do is to put you to 
work.  But not to hit or– or do certain things uncal
led for.  Those are vicious killers, that™s it.   
 

Q: Do you remember when, approxima tely, you 
entered the ghetto?   Wh
at month and year? 
 

A: No, I really don™t reme mber 
that.  I really don™t reme mber. 
 

Q: That™s okay.  And do you have a sense of 
approxima tely how long you were in the ghetto?

11
 
A: Not too long, I would say.  People rema ined af
ter they took us away, of course.  Maybe three 
months, or four months the most.  That™s all. 
 And of course you couldn™t take nothing with you, 
because you had to carry it.  Just like a pill
ow case, that™s where you put some , your belongings 
into it.  You went.  Because they didn™t 
give you enough time.  So, you wrapped whatever you 
could.  And like I said before, I was not with my 
mother.  I was with my father then and my two 
sisters, my older sister and 
my younger one.  My, my younger brot
her and my older brother and 
that™s what happened. 
 

Q: Did you witness any actions in the ghetto or 
any round-ups during the time  that you were there? 
 

A: No, we just read a bit or, or were told.  Bu
t I never witnessed anythi
ng like that, no, thank God.  
Like I said before, we were lucky at that
 point, yet.  We  were all together.   
 

Q: When did you go into hiding and why?   How did that come  about? 

 

A: Because they said, I mean they didn™t say, but 
you heard rumors that™s going be a selection, that 
they™re going to take people away from– from 
t he ghetto.  And they™re going to ship them to 
Auschwitz.  So everybody went in either to a 
ba seme nt or they built some thing underneath and 

that™s the way they™re hiding.  You took some  wa
ter with you or some  bread and that™s what 
happened.  And you we re sitting up and waiti
ng that some body should knock on the door or 
whatever.  And that™s exactly 
what happened.  We heard them 
walking upstairs, Germans with 
the boots, and we were underneath.  And from 
nowheres they found out.  And they knocked on 
the door and that™s what happened. 
 They took us out from t here. 
 

Q: You were in the same  building as where you had lived? 
 
A: No. 

 

Q: You were hiding in the same  building? 

 

A: No, no, this was a different build
ing across the street.  Yeah, my 
mother and my sisters were in 
the same  building underneath. 
 

Q: And you, will you repeat who exactly you were with?   You were with your father– 

 

A: My father, my oldest sister, be
cause her children were older, my 
father and my sister and her two 
older children and my br other and me . 
 

Q: Okay, so, four of you, okay, and plus the children. 

 

A: Plus the children, yes.  My– 
what did I want to say, I forgot. 
 Yeah.  And we got out and they 
put us on the trains.  And– crowded.  A lot of pe
ople.  And we were riding, like I said before, 

my father kept telling us, you see all 
the way, close to Auschwitz already. 
 

Q: And this was taking place in the winter time ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
12
 
 
12
 
A: In January, February, yes, when the snow wa
s fa lling on us.  And we were sitting.  A lot of– 
there was no room to go to 
the bathroom, you should excuse 
me, a lot of people made on 
themselves.  It was just like, cattle have a better, 
better look than we had.  It was just unbearable.  
And my brother, the oldest brother jumped the tr
ain.  He didn™t want to come  into Aus c hwitz and 
they were standing there and shooting.  So, I ne
ver heard from hi m, so I don™t know if he got 

shot or he got killed afterwards.  My father to 
the last mi nute still had good
 ideas, that they™re not 
going to hurt us, they™re going to put us to work. 
 But it was not so.  The mi nute we arrived to 
Auschwitz, we still saw people standing 
and digging ditches.  And he said,
 ﬁ
What did I tell you 
children?   They™re more civilized than anythi
ng else.  They™re not going to do these things.  
They™re not going to kill.ﬂ  And as soon as the 
train stopped it became like a terribl e wind.  And 
they separated us, the wo me n this way and the me n that way.  Didn™t see my father anymore.  

Didn™t see my sister, she was next to me , but 
she wouldn™t part with her children, so you pulled 
her out on this side.  So, I ran out 
from my side and I went to see– 
to be with my sister.  And the 
SS, they had canes.  They took the cane and put
 around my neck and pulled me  out.  They pulled 

me  back to that line.  So, I ran again over to my
 sister.  I think I was s
cared, I didn™t know which 
way.  I wanted to be with her.  So he took me  
out for the second time and he opened up my head.  
Hit me  with the cane over the head and that was th
e end of it.  I never saw them afterwards.  So, 
when you come  into Aus c hwitz, you had to get undr
essed and of course, I started to cry very 

much.  I wanted to go to my si
ster.  I didn™t tell them what
, what I was crying.  And an SS 
woma n comes over to me  and she says to me ,
 ﬁ
Why are you crying?ﬂ 
 Disoriented. 
Everything– it was unbelievable what they could 
put people in.  And she says to me , ﬁ Why are 
you crying?ﬂ  So I said to her, ﬁI want to go back
 to my sister.ﬂ  And she said, ﬁYou are going to 
see her tomo rrow.ﬂ  She was a good one.  And th
en another SS woma n ca me  over, said, ﬁ Why 
are you crying? ﬂ  I cried harder.  I 
said, ﬁBecause I want to go to your sister– to my sister.ﬂ  She 
said, ﬁYou™ll never see her again.ﬂ  And since that
 point, I never cried again.  Because first they, 
they cut your hair, and then th
ey tattooed, and my  hand got swo
llen like this.  And lonesome , you 
have nobody.  I was really transport from the same
 town, but they were no, not related to me .  
And I had nobody.  And the following day when they took us to work, we saw the smoke comi ng 

out of the chimney and I put two and two toge
ther and I knew exactly what was going on, that 
they not around anymor e.  Th
at™s exactly how it was. 
 

Q: Did you have any friends from Bia
ystok outside of your fa mi ly? 
 

A: Oh surely, and I me t a lot of them.  Not from
 the first day when we got there, but they had 
another transport and that™s when
 I met a lot of people from Bia
ystok, yes.  I knew them.  I went  
to school with them.  My mother knew their mother
s.  They were in business.  And that™s it, we 
stayed together.  We  tried to hold onto one another.   
 

Q: So you, did you talk togeth
er about what was going on th
ere and try to figure out–? 
 

A: We all knew the same  things.  You couldn™t figu
re out anything.  You c
ouldn™t escape as far as 
this is concerned.  You had to listen, and you ha
d to be strong, and you had to help one another 
the best you were able to.  And 
that™s exactly what happened.  I 
was always helping and one day, 
one morning– it was called the block, the pla
ce where you were staying.  And every day 
some body else had to go to get coffee in the mo
rning.  And– two people, because it looked like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
13
 
 
13
a garbage barrel.  With two _______________ and you had to carry.  And that morning was my, 
my turn to go to get the coffee in the morni
ng.  Had to go to the kitchen.  And sure enough I 
went and the other girl we nt and from nowhere 
a girl came along and she 
had a, a plate like a– 

you know, like a– I don™t know what, how to– like 
she used to get the soup there.  You know?   
They used to carry with you all the time.  And sh
e stopped the, the pot to 
get some  coffee.  And 
an SS woma n saw her through the window.  She came running out with the dog, and she poured 

the hot coffee, boiling coffee on my l e g.  And the 
skin came off right away.  And– and that™s it, 
and there was nobody to talk to.  Nobody to, 
nobody to complain.  Because nobody would listen 
to you.  They would gas you.  So, after being th
ree weeks like that, and without me dication.  I 
used to put on, they had like a litt
le blanket to cover yourself, whatev
er it was.  And I used to, I 
ripped up a piece and I made like a, like a bandage. 
 And it used to get stuck during the night and 

in the morning I used to take it off and I went
 to work like that.  A
nd couldn™t go on no more.  
And I said, after three weeks, ﬁI can™t go on no 
mo re to work.  I cannot carry on.ﬂ  I said, 
ﬁ Whatever™s going happen, it™s going to happen. 
 I™ll rema in on the block.ﬂ  And you were not 
allowed to go to– to rema in on the, on the bl
ock, because they would kill you.  They would gas 

you the same  day.  So, I went to work and we we
re digging ditches and they moved a way from 

there and I threw myself into the ditches and I figure
d I™ll let me lay there.  It™s like a grave.  Let 
me  re ma in there.  But some how they walked away and I crept out and I we nt on Revier.  The 

Revier meant, like a hospital.  And they wouldn™
t accept no Jews, of course.  So, I went in there 
and they accepted me .  They asked me who did it. 
 I said, ﬁI burned myself.ﬂ  I was not allowed 
to say that the SS woma n did it to me.  I says, ﬁI
 burned myself,ﬂ and that™s it. And they accepted 
me .  You didn™t get no help or me dication or a
nything like that, but at least you had the rest.  
You didn™t have to get up six o™clock in the morning and stand outside for 
Zahl Appell
.  They 
used to count everyone in the morning.  And this
 took an hour if it rained
 or snowed, whatever, 
they didn™t care, because they we
re dressed.  And so, I said to my
self, at least I don™t have to go 
through this.  And that™s the way I rema ined fo
r two, three weeks, and then they had a big 
selection.  And, and I don™t know if you ever sa
w it, it™s– the beds were like boards, you know 
what I™m saying?   Straight boards.  And you we
re– it was down and up.  It was two, two layers, 
the boards.  And I was upstairs.  And they sa
id everybody should go down because they had like 
a selection.   
 

Q: Was this in the Revier or in the bl ock? 

 

A: No, this was at the Revier.  Revier means a hospital,
 that™s what they used to
 call it.  Yes.  This 
was at the Re vier.  And the SS came in and they
 said, ﬁEverybody come  down from the bed.  
Used to call it colliers 
(ph )
.  And– a nd everybody should go down.  I touched my next door girl 
and the other side and they were dead.  Th
ey came from Greece and 
they couldn™t– they 
couldn™t take the climate, because they were used 
to warm climate.  And it, at that point it was 
not warm in, in Auschwitz.  It was winter time.  
And they just , they used to fl y, lay, they fell like 
flies.  They went to bed and they never got up. 
 And I said to myself, ﬁI don™t stand a chance.ﬂ  
This is all your head, you™re
 talking to yourself.  I don™t st
and a chance by going down, because 
you had to take off whatever you wore and parade 
through them naked.  And if they like the way 
you looked, they put you one way and if they didn
™t, they gassed you.  So, I said, ﬁI™m not going 
to give them satisfaction.  I™m not going down.ﬂ
  And I rema ined like that on the bed.  Somebody 
carried on with you, you know, tell you not to do it. 
 And the Doctor, Doctor Mengele was a very 
tall fellow.  And he touched one, two, and here 
I was laying in the mi ddle.  And he didn™t touch 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
14
 
 
14
me, because I was still warm.  They could have 
taken me  down and killed me .  And I rema ined 
like that, so this actually saved my life.   
 

Q: How did you know it was Doctor Mengele? 

 

A: Oh, you could tell.  They announced it, too.  
They announced everything. 
 You knew.  Yeah, you 
couldn™t do nothing about it, but you knew.  And 
then some how, I, I don™t reme mber it was from 
Greece or from a different country, 
that gave them a lot of...  I 
think it was from Greece.  And 
they shouldn™t gas.  They stopped gassing for a 
while.  And that™s the way I rema ined on the– 
on the Revier.  And it saved me  because I didn™t ha
ve to get up in the morning, like I said before, 
to stand outside and wait for the 
Zahl Appell
.  And I got the same , how 
did we used to call it?   
Sa me  a mount of food that I would get when I worked
 outside.  That piece of bread and that soup.  
And I was friendly with a girl, she was not far 
fro m Auschwi t z, we were
 sleeping together and 

eating together and between the two of us– she 
lives in England now.  Between the two of us, 
we had two slices of bread, so we were rich.  So
 one slice we have to– we used to save it up for 

the night me al and for the morning, we took along the other one to work.  We  never finished 

both slices of bread.  One we put away. 
 

Q: Was she in the Revier with you? 

 

A: Oh yes, she was all over.  No.  She was not–  af
ter.  After.  No, not in the Revier.  She was not 
with me in the Revier. 
 

Q: What was her name? 

 

A: Halina. 
 
Q: Halina, what was her last name ?  

 

A: Oh, what was her last name ?   I know, I have 
to take a look in the book, because– She lives in 
England.   
 

Q:  Okay, we can check later, if you™d like. 

 

A:  Yeah, I have to take a look in the bo
ok, so.  You want it now, shall I take a look? 
 

Q: Sure.  You can say it.  What was her name ?  

 

A: Halina Lichtenstein.   

 

Q: Okay, thank you.  Can you, were you about to say 
some thing else or shall I ask a question now? 

 

A: Ask me  a question. 

 

Q: Okay, you me ntioned before you got the burn
 on your leg, that you were working, you were 
digging ditches.  We re you working outside of the camp?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
15
 
 
15
 
A: Outside, outside, yes, we used to go from the 
Zahl Appell
 from in the mo rning, they used to take 
you to work by groups.  I don™t know how ma ny peopl
e they needed that day.  So, like they 
counted off thirty, forty, sixty, whatever they 
needed, and we ma rched.  We followed them and 
whatever they said to do, that™s
 what you had to do that day.  A lo
t of times they brought back a 
lot of girls, back dead ones, because they didn™t 
like the way they looked, or for no reason at all.  
And they brought them back on– on two pieces of 
wood, ac tually.  And that™s they put them 
back, because they had to account, each and ever
yone they took out from the gate, to bring the 
same  a mount back, even if dead.  But they had 
to bring you back.  And that™s what happened. 
 

Q: Were you living in the– do you reme mber
 where your barrack 
was?   Was it in–  
 

A: Oh sure.  Twenty-one was the, from there they us
ed to take you to gas.  But this must have been 
four or five. 
 

Q: InBirkenau? 

 

A: In Birkenau and then we went to Auschwitz.  Fr
om Birkenau it was a terr ible place.  Fi rst of all 
when I arrived there we didn™t have no water yet. 
 We  had a lot of mud and I lost a shoe.  If you 
put your foot in, you couldn™t take 
it out, you had to leave the shoe.  
And it was horrible.  It was 
not to be believed that you could do that to
 people.  And mostly young people, because they 
never chose elderly, because they didn™t, they 
only needed you to work.  And the elderly, of 
course, didn™t have no strength, 
so they gassed them right awa
y.  But the younger ones, they– as 
long as they needed you, they used you and then
 after that they kill
ed you.  And that™s it. 
 

Q: Do you remember the prisoner functionaries, Kapos–? 
 
A: Oh sure, I reme mber the Kapos very well, yes.   

 

Q: Will you tell me about, what 
your experience was with them? 
 

A: I had very bad experience with them.  Like I sa
id, we were in Birkenau and the fi rst thing in the 
morning, after they, of course, cut my hair, putthe number on and did ever
ything else what they 

had to, separated us, of course, from the loved 
ones.  And six o™clock in
 the morning or five 
o™clock in the morning, these four people from C
zechoslova ki a, they came before us.  And they 
were real meanies.  Mean.  They had nothing nice
 about them.  And the first thing out of their 
mouth at six o™clock in the morning was ﬁ
Polska koovi stavach
 
(ph )
.ﬂ  I– I, the fi rst time in my 
life, by that point, I heard.  It meant, to expl
ain it, ﬁPolish whores, get up.ﬂ  And I was so 
bewildered with that sayi ng, because I didn™t know 
even what a whore me ant at that point.  And 
that was my first greeting with the Ka pos.  
And from then on, like I said, there was nobody that 
told you, but you figured out already what™s goi
ng on and, and that™s it.  You cannot go under 
their nails, you cannot ask for anything, because you
™re not going to get it and you have to obey.  
You have to leave at a certain time  your room an
d then that™s it.  You couldn™t stay there.  To 

rema in on the bed?   Neve r, because they woul
d gas you right away.  And like I said, luck was 
with me , I don™t know if it™s luck, or–  I always 
said, that through my lif
e, through my stories I 
always feel that some body carries on with you.  Or
 whatever it happens in life, that some body 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
16
 
 
16
carries on with you.  It™s God will.  I shouldn™t ha
ve gotten off the bed.  Had I gotten off the bed, 
they would have taken me  i mmediately.  But like I 
said, my brain told me, you™ll never ma ke it.  
And don™t get undressed and don™t go through him.  
And I rema ined.  And like I said before, I 
was in the Re vier after a few week
s.  And of course they didn™t 
treat me, but at least I had the 
chance to– not to go outside.  And then I got a 
better job.  So the woma n t hat took care on me , 
she was a Polish woma nŠnot took care, but she 
spoke to me , let™s put it this wayŠon the 
Revier, was a very nice person.  So one day I ap
proached her after being there ma ybe three or 
four months.  So I, I asked he
r if– she used to come  in the 
morning, she was wearing a white 
coat.  And she was clean and she had a short 
hair cut.  She was really pretty woma n. 
 
Q: Do you remember her name ?  

 

A: She was a Polish– Magda, I think it was.  And 
I, I approached her one morning.  And I said to 
her, ﬁWhat do you do with the water after you finish washing yourself? ﬂ  And she looked at me .  

She says, ﬁWhy?   Do you want to drink it? ﬂ  I sa
id, ﬁNo, who drinks dirt
y water? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI 
want to wash myself around the way you do.  I wa
nt to be clean.  I want to look good like you 
do.ﬂ  So, some thing we nt into her head and she, 
every day that she came in, in the morning, she 
brought me  a, you know, a basin, a small basin w
ith water with the soap and the dirt and 

everything when she washed herself.  And I used
 to wash myself around.  And I felt so good, like 
a million dollars.  So I said to myself, how coul
d I help the woman?  I had no money.  I can™t 
give her no money.  I can™t give 
her nothing that I have of me .  
What could I do?   I said, okay, 
I™m going to help her to clean out.  She was clean
ing out under the beds, the walk.   And I said, I 
have to help her. Before she gets here, I™m goi
ng to do it and when she comes she won™t have so 

much work.  So, I told her.  But when I went 
down, I could, I fainted fr
om laying so long on the 
bed.  That I couldn™t, I couldn™t do.  So I got up, 
and some body helped me to go back on the bed.  
When she came in that day, I told her what ha
ppened.  She says, ﬁIf you want to live, you must 
get off that bed.ﬂ  I said, ﬁSure I want to live.ﬂ 
 So, she said, ﬁBut let™s 
do it–ﬂ excuse me .  ﬁYou 
start doing it before the SS comes in, before th
ey change.ﬂ  So, I don™t know what time  it was, 
four or five o™clock, I don™t know.  So I climbed 
down again from the bed and I was able to stand 
for a mi nute.  So this was really a big accomplishm
ent.  And I took a chair and I pushed it.  And I 
was walking, like jumping, I couldn™t put down ye
t the foot all the way 
on the bottom, on the 
floor like.  But every day I tried, until I got
 stronger.

Tape 2, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interv
iew with Justine Le rner.  Okay, go ahead with the 
story about cleaning. 
 
A: About cleaning for that woma n. 
 And she appreciated it very, ve
ry much.  And she thought it was 
very clever of me  to do a thing 
like that.  And she used to give me  an extra piece of bread.  And 
at that point, she told me  that I cannot rema in on 
the bed.  I have to get off and they were, they 
were trying out– there was a period
 of time that they didn™t gas.
  They got a lot of mo ney.  I 
think it was from Turkey or I can™t reme mber ex
actly from where it was.  And this was to, to 
hold off the, the selections.  And she said they 
were trying, they were looking for, for nurses.  

That pretty soon they were going to ask who want
s to become  a nurse.  So, she said to me , ﬁI 

would advise you to volunteer for that.ﬂ  So, that
™s exactly what I did.  I volunteered and I was 
transferred fr om this into a diffe
rent, a better place, not too far 
from one another.  And I didn™t 
get as a nurse, but I got as– when the new arri
vals came on, when they took off their clothes, 
the personal things you had to leave there too, 
everything.  And you had to go through to look for 
diamonds, or for money people used to sew in th
eir clothes.  And that
™s what was my job. 
 

Q: This is the Canada commando? 

 

A: Oh yeah, that™s right.  You know that.  Yes, yes,
 Canada, yes, right, right, 
right.  So that™s where 
I worked.  And of course the SS stood right
 by and there was big boxes like, how do you– like 
piggy banks, but of course it was not a piggy ban
k, but it was a, big boxes with locks on top.  
And they used to– had to put in all the, whatever
 you got, put it right in there.  And this was my 

job.  And then you had to bring in th
e clothes to the zone or whatever 
they call it.  It
™s like a, they 
used to– like cleaners, they used to clean the cl
othes.  They went through the heat, and that™s 
what– I don™t know what they did w
ith it afterwards, but that™s what
 it was.  And that™s what I 
was working for.  And this helped me, too, not to
 get outside with my leg.  And of course, it 
healed by now, but I– it left me  a terrible scar
.  It– it grew like wild
 flesh on it, but I was 
happy that I could walk on it.  A
nd that™s what it was.  When I came out of there, when people 
saw me  that they knew me , they didn™t believe th
at I™m alive, because months I was not with 
them. 
 

Q: Did you go back to living in the same barrack
 that you were living i
n, sleeping in before you 
went to the Revier? 
 

A: No, I didn™t go to that barrack because I was 
in a different place alr
eady.  And– but it was a 
better place, because there, like I said befo
re, you didn™t ha ve  to stand outside in– for the 
Zahl 
Appell
.  They knew exactly where we  are and where 
we™re working and that™s what it happened. 
 

Q: So, there was not more 
Zahl Appell 
at all? 
 

A: No, no more in the morning, no more 
Zahl Appell
s, no.  You didn™t have– they didn™t have to 
count you already, because they knew there were
 so ma ny people, so ma ny people are working 

there and that™s what it was.  
My luck that I had the job.

Q: Is this where you me t, you me
ntioned that you had a friend–? 
 
A: Halina? 

 

Q: Halina. 

 

A: Yes, that™s where I met her.  Halina Lichtenste
in, yes, we became very good friends, like sisters.  
And like I wa s telling you before, we never finished
 the bread and everybody used to be envious.  
How could we do it?   I says, that™s exactly wh
at happened.  We™re not vultures.  We  thought 
tomorrow, we™re going to live maybe till tomorrow, 
so we™ll have the bread for tomo rrow.  A lot 
of people didn™t do that.  They– whatever they
 gave them, who knows if they™ll ma ke it to 
tomorrow?   In the meantime, they ate it up.  And 
I never cut my bread.  I always gave her, she 
should do it.  Because thinking, God forbid, ma ybe 
I™m taking a bigger slice for myself.  Would 
never do that.  That was in my mi nd.  That™s th
e way I was raised.  And we were wonderful, we 
were just like fa mily. 
 

Q: Was she from Bia
ystok, too? 
 

A: No, she was from Bendin 
(ph )
, that™s near Auschwitz, not too 
far from Auschwitz.  So she was 
from around there, yes. 
 

Q: Do you think it helped you to survive, to have
 that little b
it of huma nity and kindness in your 
life?   Did that help you to
 have hope for your future? 
 

A: I don™t know.  It has to do– I never changed as 
far as helping people.  All my life I suffered for 
that.  I never changed.  I think 
it has to do with the upbringing, 
to do, be good, to help.  Even 
now, all my life I™ve been like th
at, after the war too.  If some body–  My mother was that way.  
If some body needed a donation, or to ma rry off 
a child and they had no money, my mother was 
always there helping.  She knew already the people, and they always gave 
her and she always put 
it in anonymous, not to know or to
 thank you what you did.  This is a wonderful thing.  And I do 
it the same way.  All my life I™ve 
been doing it.  I got– my  hair was cut off, but later on towards 
the end, they allowed you a li
ttle hair to grow.  And wh
en the transfers from Bia
ystok came, and 
like I said before, I had a good job 
already and I was trying to help. 
 And they told me that the 
block elteste
 
(ph )
, in other words, this was the one that
 was wa tching them, the Kapo, she wanted 
a doll.  Like I said before, we were working, we 
were working with the clothes and, and so I told 
some body else, if they came  along, you find a doll, put
 it away.  Hide it.  I took the doll and I 

threw it over the, the fence.  And they caught me .  And they pulled me  out.  And they cut my 

hair, again, because at that point  already we 
had, you know, they let you 
have a little hair 
already.  And of course, when they take the hair o
ff, they take all the beau
ty away, especially to a 
woma n.  And they put me  on a, on a 
pail in the mi ddle of everybody, like at 
Zahl Appell
, and 
they gave me  sixteen, uh, with a belt. 
 

Q: Lashes? 

 

A: Lashes.  And that™s it, you couldn™t cry, and 
you couldn™t say anything.  
And that™s that.  You 
were guilty.  You took it and that™s 
what it was.  So you would think 
I forgot already?  No.  Then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
19
 
 
19
some body else needed some thing else, but that™s 
the way I am.  I can™t help myself, always good 
to people.  I always shared.   
 
Q: Were you injured by that to 
the point where it was hard to work?   Or did you recover? 

 

A: I wasn™t injured.  No, I was 
not injured, but I was ashame d.  Th
e shame was there, but not the 
injury.  It hurt for a bit, the backside hurt, of 
course, but not ashame d.  I was ashame d rather than 
pain, let™s put it this way. 
 

Q: Did you have dreams and fantasie
s, things that you would do to
 escape in your mi nd, at least? 
 

A: No, I knew I could never ma ke it.  No, no, no.  I 
was just like a lamb.  I was following whatever 
they said.  I helped people, yes.  I have a frie
nd, that I saved her.  She lives in Brooklyn yet.  
Called me  last week.  Sonja Rotenberg 
(ph )
 is her name .  She  had ma laria, and there was a 
selection going through.  And she, and I was working 
that time.  She said to me , ﬁJustine, Jospe, 
Jospele, help me , help me , help me .ﬂ  So I t
ook a beet, and I rubbed her 
cheeks, and I put her on 
a clean nightgown.  And instead of going throug
h this way and shaking, I put a ma ttress under 
her, she could quiet down.  And instead of going th
is way, she went that wa y.  And all her life– 
she™s in Brooklyn.  And always, forever, said, ﬁShe
 was the one that saved my life.  She was the 
one that saved my life.ﬂ And I alwa
ys did things that seemed possibl
e, let™s put it this way, just to 
help out some body.  But that™s 
my nature, I can™t help it. 
 

Q: When– what would– do you reme
mber what you would talk about with your friend, like with 
Halina or any other friends when you weren™t working? 
 

A: I reme mber a lot– you couldn™t talk while you 
were working.  I™m talking about already after 
the war we were together in France.   
 

Q: Did you have a chance to talk together while 
you weren™t working while 
you were in Auschwitz? 
 

A: Here and there a word, but you couldn™t ma ke 
the conversation, because they were watching and 
nobody wanted we should get hurt.  You know what 
I™m saying?   So if it was important you said 
one word, but otherwise you wouldn™t talk.  You 
couldn™t have a conversation, especially when 
they were standing and watching you.  Uh uh.   
 

Q: Did you work, how ma ny days a week did you work?    

 

A: Every day.  There was no Sabbat
h, no Sunday, no, every day you worked. 
 

Q: Frommorninguntil– 

 

A: From morning until, they had to bring you back at
 a certain time, five or
 six o™clock, de pends the 
time of the year.  If the day was longer, you work
ed longer.  If the day was getting dark, you had 
to return back.

Q: Did you have any hope that you would surviv
e?   Did you have an idea that it would end 
s o me t i me ?  
 
A: Not at this point.  Not from the beginning, you 
had no hope.  Later on you started to have hope.  
But not from that point.   
 

Q: How did you start to have hope?   Did you 
get any news from the outside world? 
 

A: You didn™t have to get news.  First of all, th
ey were evacuating us from Auschwitz, because the 
Russians came  close and they did not– the Germans did not want to fall into the Russian hands.  

So, they evacuated us to Ravensbrück.  Ravensbr
ück was another camp, but it was not as bad as 
Auschwitz.  They didn™t have the gassing chambers. 
 It was just a concentr
ation camp a nd there I 
got a job in the kitchen.  And I was dishing out
 food and everybody came  over, ﬁJospele, Jospele, 
give me  some food.ﬂ  Just pour 
it in.  You know, because I, it wa
s not mi ne to begin with, and 
they were hungry.  So I always di
d that.  In that respect I was 
lucky, I always got good jobs.  And 
then from Ravensbrück they transferred us to Sw
itau.  That™s where we 
were liberated.  And 
there, I was already there with nine
, nine girls.  All of us were 
Jewish girls.  And somehow, like I 
said before, this was not a concentration camp. 
 They couldn™t gas you there.  It was just 
working, a camp, a conc entration, but without th
e, without the, what do you call that? The gas 
chambers.  So, now we were there nine girls an
d there were a lot of Polish women that were 
from Auschwitz.  And they exactly knew that we are Jews.  So, one day we spoke among 

ourselves and we decided that we™re not going to
 go in, all of us, together to wash in the 
morning, because we didn™t want to be with any
body that should identify us.  So, we ran in and 
we washed ourselves, like three of them and thr
ee stood outside.  And that
™s the way we made it 
up.  Sure enough, one day all of the Polish, and they
 were even anti-Semites.  They were very 
mean.  It™s not that we took anything away, but th
ey had to squeal, they 
had to tell that we are 
not, that we are not gentiles, we are Jews.  
And sure enough, one day they found out.  And they 
went and they squealed.  And they called us all 
out.  These, these, th
ese, you know, the numbers 
they called and we had to go in the fr ont.  A
nd they said to us, ﬁA re you Jewish?   Are you 
Jews?ﬂ  We said, ﬁNo.ﬂ  We made it up before, becau
se we felt that it™s the end.  That was what 
it was trying to come .  We heard the, you know, 
that™s a battlefield going on.  We  heard the 
shooting.  We heard the 
cannonen
 
(ph )
, they used to call it, the– everything, but we didn™t know 
exactly when it™s going to be the end.  We  knew 
it™s nearby.  So, that™s the way we made up, that 
we– each one was going to say, ﬁMy mother was Je
wish, my father was a gentile.ﬂ  The other 
one said, ﬁMy father was gentile, my mother wa
s Jewish.ﬂ  You know, all of us denying.  And 
they looked, and they looked, and they looked and thank God, they didn™t kill us.  But– and 
then from there we went to Sw
itau.  This was the last camp. 
 

Q: I™m going to, sorry, I™m going to interrupt you a l
ittle bit, because I wanted to hear about how 
you got from– I don™t want get too far ahead of
 it, because I wanted to hear about– 
 

A: Hmm. I™m making it alrea
dy finished.  (Laughter.) 
 

Q: –Yeah.  There was a time– 

 

A: You got to go? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

21
Daniel Lerner (Justine™s grandson): Yeah. 
 

Q: Would you tell me  about, let™s go back to the tim
e that you were in Auschwitz and you™re getting 
ready to leave.  Did you leave on a fo
rced ma rch?   How did that happen? 
 

A: We left, they put us back on buses, open buses
.  And I reme mber like now it was snowing.  And 
we all climbed up on the buses.  And they were ta
king us– we didn™t know where, but we got to 
Ravensbrück. 
 

Q: This was winter 1945?  
 Is that right?    

 

A: ‚45, right.  We stayed in Ra
vensbrück not too long, ma ybe six m
onths.  And from there we went 
to last  one, Switau, the Czechs.  And that wa
s, that™s where we were liberated from. 
 

Q: So, you were, you didn™t have to ma rch out of–? 

 

A: No, no.  Some of the m from the beginning, they
 took them by foot.  We  went by train, by bus.  
Yeah, they loaded us up on the buses and we tr
aveled by bus, because it wa s a few selections 
from Auschwitz, two or three, because a lot of them
 went by foot and they ran away from there.  
That my friend™s– her husband did that.  He es
caped, because he knew the area.  It was, Bendin 
was not too far from Auschwitz.  And he knew exac
tly the area, the woods, and that™s where he 
escaped to. 
 

Q: Who, who– I™m sorry.  Will you repeat who escaped? 

 

A:  That™s my fr iend™s husband.  Halina, the one that is England now, her husband did that.   
 
Q: She was married at the time? 

 

A: She was ma rried before the war, right.  Right.  
She was a little older than
 I was.  She was ma rried 
before the wa r.  And that™s what her husband 
escaped into the woods, because they knew the 

area very well. 
 

Q: Were you with Halina on the buses away from–? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber.  I really don™t remember.  She 
had to be together, beca
use we were on the last 
one.  We  were in Switau together.   
 

Q: Were you in Ravensbrück together? 

 

A: In Ravensbrück together, too, yeah.  
So we were there together, right.   
 

Q: Do you remember anything a
bout the journey by bus?    
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
22
 
 
22
A: It was not a bus like a bus.  It was like  a 
truck, you know.  The journey was terrible, because it 
was like unknown, you didn™t know where you were 
going.  And that™s all I could reme mber 
actually fr om that. 
 
Q: What kind of a bus was it?   Wa s it closed? 

 

A: Open, open like cattle, you know, like an open bi
g bus.  A truck better than a bus.  A truck I 
would say, an open truck, yes.   
 

Q: And were you with people who were from the Canada Commando that you worked with? 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

 

Q: All wome n or wome n and me n? 

 

A: All wome n.  There was no me n 
down there, all wome n.  Differ
ent blocks had me n, but no, we 
were all wome n.  
 

Q: Is there anything else that you can think of to
 tell me about your time in Auschwitz?   Was there 
anything striking that happened to 
you?   Anything you want to say? 
 

A: The only thing I could reme mber is like I sai
d, they burned my  leg and when they cut my hair 
off.  And they hit me .  Otherwise, oh sure when
 I came out of the Revier
, out of the hospital, 
people didn™t want to believe that I™m alive, b
ecause they, they didn™t see me for mont hs.  So, 
this was a shock to a lot of th
em, eve n my cousin, but we stay
ed together.  And nothing else, I 
mean I witnessed a lot, but nothi
ng else that I could really sa
y, that unusual, you know what I™m 
saying?   Everybody else ther
e lived the same  thing.  
 

Q: You had a cousin who was in Auschwitz? 

 

A: Yes, yes.  The only two, my mother and her 
mother were sisters and she came with the second 
transport, but she was ten year
s younger than I was.  She was,
 I think, the youngest thing in 
Auschwitz.  She passed away three ye
ars ago.  She had a heart attack. 
 

Q: What was her name? 

 

A: Her name was Leah Weitzenfeld 
(ph)
, and she was ma rried in New York. 
 

Q: Weitzenfeld was her maiden name? 

 

A: Weitzenfeld was her ma iden name , yes, Leah We itzenfeld, yes.  And she has two children, a son, 
who™s a pharmacist and he ma rried a pharmacist. 
 And we are in touch.  They live in Brooklyn, 
yeah. 
 

Q: Did you try, did you have any information at al
l when you were in Auschwitz about what had 
happened to your fa mily?   Wa s there any way to find out? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
23
 
 
23
 
A: No, no.  Wh en the second transport came , or the th
ird one it would have to be, they said that they 
saw my mot her comi ng into Auschwitz.  The people from Bia
ystok, interviewed them.  And 
they said– and that™s when 
I got hit, when they wanted a doll for the Block elteste 
(ph )
, for the 
Kapo.  And that™s when I tried to organize and gi
ve it to her.  And that
™s what happened.  And 
that™s when they said, in that transport my mo
ther was, but I did not see her.  I did not see 
anybody, no.  That was last time .  When I me t them
 at, when we arrived in Auschwitz, I never 
saw them again.  Always hoping, alwa ys search
ing, always looking, but of course, nothing.  
When I was in Paris, we lived in Paris for a y
ear, after the war, of c
ourse.  And I was always 
going on the trains, looking.  In Europe the trai
ns are much better than– you never saw a train, 
did you?  Oh, in Wa shington they have beauti
ful trains.  Here, because it was riding in 
Washington on the train.  But by us 
in New York, the trains were hor
rible.  And I always used to 
run from train to train.  That™s
 what I did in Paris, looking, th
e searching.  From the back, look 
like my sister, from the back look like my brothe
r.  Always thinking, looking into their eyes, but 
of course, it was not them.  But I always t
hought, yes, yes, I™m going to find some body.  But 
that™s it.   
 

Q: Now, going back again, just a little bit.  I don™
t know whether this question is going to be clear, 
but you described before you arrived in Auschw
itz how, what a close-knit fa mily you were. 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: You were all very close and you were dependent
 on your parents to a certa
in degree to kind of 
tell you what was going on and to give you a sense of
 how things, like what the future mi ght be.  
And you talked about how you trusted your father a
nd your father always believed that things 
would turn out all right.  It must have been a 
terrible shock to arrive 
and be suddenly separated 
from everyone you knew and yet some how, some how
 you survived that.  Can you say some thing 
about how you adjusted to that extreme change? 
 

A: I always fe lt, this I told my fr
iends in Paris also, that this was 
my  mo t h e r ™ s  a n d  my  fa t h e r ™ s  l a s t  
wish, that some body has to rema in from the fa m
ily and carry on.  And I 
was the one to survive 
and that™s what I have to do.  I have to build back
 what we lost.  That™s the way I lived after the 
war.  But of course, it™s just like a, like a ma de up
 story, but it™s, this helped
 me a lot in my life.  
Like I™m not doing it, but some body e l se tells me  to do it. 
 

Q: That was what kept you going in the camp?  

 

A: That™s what kept me  going.  My friend told me
 that, too.  Halina, the one from England.  There 
was a time in my life when I was in Paris, I™ m 
going way ahead.  This was after the war and we 
were liberated.  And the Americans liberated us.  
And each of us from the nine girls that there 
were, had family in the United States.  I had an uncle.  This one had a sister and this one had in 

South America.  Every one of us had fa mily a
nd they advised us that we shouldn™t go back to 

Poland.  They asked us, what do we want to do.  
And we said, we want to go to Poland to look 
for the fami l y.  And they advised us not to go 
back to Poland, because 
at  that point al ready 
everything was shared up already, 
what belongs to whom.  Poland belonged to Russia already.  
And they told us not to go, because we™ll neve r ge
t out of there.  So, the only thing they advised, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
24
 
 
24
advised us, excuse me , is we should go back to Pa
ris.  Excuse me .  So, the Americans, the ones 
that liberated, advised us not to go back to Pari
s, uh, not to go back to Poland.  We  should go to 
Paris, fr om there the organizations will take over and we™ll fi nd our fa mily and then we™ll be able 
to get to them.  So that™s exactly what happe
ned.  They gave us a paper and they put us on, 
because we had no clothe s.  So, they gave us a pa
per, and they gave us uniforms that the WACs 
wore and they put us on the train.  And we were
 going to Paris from Switau, from the Czechs, we 
were going to Paris.  And on the way they took us
 off the train one stop and they said that we 
shouldn™t talk to them, we should just give them
 the paper.  And sure enough on the, the next 
stop they put us back on and we came to Paris. 
 And there Rothschild gave us, it was a hotel.  
And they gave us the hotel for the mi splaced pe ople
.  And that™s what it was.  We slept two in a 
room and downstairs was a kitchen. 
 So, and we used to be able to come  down and eat.  Now, I 

don™t reme mber how long I was there, but I just 
couldn™t go down with a dish again and eat.  So, 
I cried so much.  But it was more tears in the di
sh than it was food.  And I decide I™m going to 
cook for my self.  And each floor, they had like a 
two burner.  So, that™s what happened.  I bought 
some  potatoes and that™s what I used to cook.  
But of course, there was like a line.  You know, 
you had to wait quite a while, but 
it was for me  better not to go dow
nstairs, but to cook and eat 
for myself.  And so, that™s where 
I got in with my friend.  I slept with Halina, with my girlfriend.  
My cousin and another fr iend was in the other ro
om.  We  were– we had nine rooms, one after 
the other.  And at one point practically ever
ybody found their fa mily already and they were 
leaving.  And of course, me , I didn™t find my fa mil
y, didn™t find my uncle.  And the only thing is, 

I said to my self and I said to them too, either he™s
 very rich, he doesn™t wa
nt to identify hims elf, 
or he died, one of the two, so ma ny years.  So– 
 

Q: I™m going to, I™m sorry to do this, but I™m goi
ng to interrupt you again, because I™m going to 
forget–  
 
A: We skipped too much. 
 

Q: Yeah, we need to go back. 

 

A: We need to go back, yes. 

 

Q: And find out a little bi
t.  But we™ll reme mber– 
 

A: Where we stopped– 

 

Q: –where we left off. 

 

A: Yes, in Paris. 

 

Q: And come  back to that, okay? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: You were, we were talking a little while a
go about the trip fro m Ausc
hwi t z to Ravensbrück. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
25
 
 
25
A: Ravensbrück,right. 
 

Q: And you had me ntioned a little earlier a little 
bit about Ravensbrück, but
 would you tell me more 
about the conditions there and what the living cond
itions were like, where you slept and so forth?   
And then I™ll ask you a few questions about Ravensbrück. 
 

A: The sleeping conditions were pr
actically the same , but the only thing is, there we already had 
water.  You could wash yourself whenever you wa
nted.  And of course the food was the same , 
but we didn™t have the–

Tape 2, Side B 
 
Q: Tape two, side B of an interview with Jus
tine Lerner.  You were telling me about arriving. 
 
A: Ravensbrück, yeah.  And we didn™t have it on our 
heads that there is gas 
chamber.  So you were 
a little bit more at ease than you were in Ausc
hwitz.  That™s the only 
thing.  That™s the only 
thing. 
 

Q: You were with your cous
in at that point, too? 
 

A: My cousin, I don™t reme mber her being in Ra
vensbrück, because I think we were not.  In 
Auschwitz we were together.  And then after the wa
r, in the last one we 
were together.  In the 
last one we were, but Ravensbrück, I don™t reme mber if she was with me . 
 

Q: Do you know how long the journey fr
om Auschwitz to Ravensbrück took? 
 

A: I really don™t reme mber.  It had to be 
a few hours, ma ybe five or six hours for sure. 
 

Q: Did you have the sense at that time th
at the war was comi ng close to an end? 
 

A: Only from, because you were talking among yo
urself.  I mean, here and there some body passed 
by and they heard a radio.  So this came  the ne
ws, but otherwise we were not allowed to have 
any, any news.  But like I said, you heard, heard th
e guns, I mean you ha d to be deaf not to hear 
it, because it was nearby.  But of course, we di
d not know when we were going to be liberated.  

We knew it was close, but how close we did not 
know.  Because at one point like we used to 
hear ﬁroooh, rooohﬂ all night long an
d then all of a sudden it got quiet.  So we figured it out, 
geniuses, that they push
ed them back.  You know what I™m sa
ying?   And then again, and then 
again it was too quiet.  But we 
knew that the end is near, but we
 didn™t know how near it was. 
 

Q: You said you got a job in th
e kitchen?   Is that right? 
 

A: Always the kitchen.  I love th
e kitchen.  (Laughing.)  I– how di
d it happen?   By luck, like I said 
before, nothing unusual, just picked, you know.  A
nd that™s it.  And like I said before, everybody 
put in their, their thing 
and took out some  food a nd of course, I 
didn™t stop them.  And that™s it.  
And that™s what people appreciate
d.  Always was there for the unde
rtaker, I always let them do. 
 

Q: Did people look out for you, too?   You talk a
bout how you were looking out for other people.  
Do you think people were looki
ng out for you too, as a result? 
 

A: I always had belief that they would.  I always believed that they would.  I had very dear friends 
and that™s what actually helped 
me  in actual life, because family we didn™t have.  And we were 
like sisters and brothers.  When you first came to th
e, to the United States and prior to that, we 
were looking for one another and when we
 found each other it was like, like you found 
some body from the fa mily.  And don™t forget, it™s ove
r fifty years and we still, the ones that are 
alive, we are very, very close. 
 There is no week that I shouldn™
t speak to them.  And helping in

every way that we could, if God forbid some bod
y™s sick.  When it happened to me , only my 
friend from concentration camp helped me . 
 
Q: When you were, when you had– when you were attacked? 

 

A: Yes, when I was attacked and left in the house.  So, I was all alone.  My husband had passed 
away and my tenant moved out that day, the 
one that lived upstairs
.  And there was nobody, 
nobody.  And that day I was supposed to go to a f
uneral, also from, one fr om concentration 
camp.  She l ost her son of cancer, young fellow.  
And I was going to go to the funeral.  And I 
had a ride.  She didn™t live too 
far from me , a fe w blocks.  And 
when I came down on the block 
they told that  they just left .  They didn™t wa
it for me .  I was very disappointed and hurt, and 
unbelievable, how could you not wait?   I don™t know if
 up to today, if they forgot or they just 
didn™t care.  I don™t know.  Because right afte
r this it ha ppened.  And I never– I don™t know 
them so well.  But being she lives on the block, 
I was going to go with th
eir neighbor, which they 
were also survivors of the Holocau
st.  But like I said, I didn™t know 
them s o close.  So I really 
don™t know if they did it deliberately 
or if they forgot, because I ne
ver was able to di scuss it with 
them.  So, when I came there on the block and it 
was very short for me , ma ybe two blocks.  So 
the neighbor said to me , ﬁ Whom you looking for? ﬂ  
So, I told her.  She sa
id, ﬁThey just left.  
Everybody left.ﬂ  So, I came  home  a nd I got und
ressed.  This was on a Friday, and started to 
prepare for dinner.  And I opened up the window.  
And the, I had a, a, you know, what they call 
that?   For the air to come thr
ough.  Like a shade or whatever 
it™s called.  And not thinking, not 
thinking, that God forbid some body™s  going to cl
imb in through that, open up the window and 
get in.  And he hit me  in the head, cut my face.  I don™t know, he broke my  arms, they were 

hanging, both of them.  He did some thing terrible
.  And my friend– me  and his wife, she passed 
away, we were the best of friends from concentr
ation camp.  I™m now friends with her daughters, 
always was.  They live in New 
York– he knew that I was supposed to go to the funeral.  He 
didn™t go.  And he kept calling.  Called in the 
evening and no answer.  So he couldn™t figure it 
out what™s going on.  Then he thought ma ybe I we
nt to, the woman that lost her son, to their 
daughter, to stay with them, he
lp out.  So, Sunday he came along to the house and I lived on the 
corner.  And he walked around, parked the car and 
he walked around this way.  ﬁJustine, Justine, 
where are you? ﬂ  And I don™t know from what and 
when.  I yelled out, ﬁHere I am.  Save me , 
help me .ﬂ  And that™s when he heard my voice. 
 Across the street was sitting wome n, neighbors.  
So they, he asked the neighbors, ﬁDid you see 
Justine?ﬂ  And she said ﬁNo, but I™m wondering, 

the light is on.  She never used to leave the light
 on.  The light is on and I 
haven™t seen her.ﬂ  So, 
when he heard that, he ran over to them a
nd they climbed through the window, the kitchen 
window, because I had a porch, like
 a terrace like this, but hi gher. 
 And they went in, one of 
them went in through the window and they found 
me  laying on the floor in my bedroom in a 
puddle of blood.  And that™s when they called th
e police.  And the police called an ambulance 
and that™s why they put me  into a hospital, a trau
ma  hospital.  And they called my son and that™s 
what happened. 
 

Q: How long had you been lying th
ere before some body found you? 
 

A: Twenty-four hours.   

 

Q:  Oh, my. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
28
 
 
28
 
A:  Twenty-four hours, from Friday, I don™t know what
 time  Friday.  But from Friday till Sunday.  It 
had to be Friday ma ybe twelve or one o™clock 
in the afternoon.  And that™s what happened. 
 

Q: Well, let™s– we™ll come back to that time again later, but let™s again go back to the time that you 
were in Ravensbrück.  And you, you started working 
in the kitchen.  Wa s there brutality on the  

part of the guards?   Or were 
things starting to ease off? 
 

A: No, no, we didn™t find it so bad. 
 It was like a paradise away from
 Ausc hwitz in Ravensbrück.  It 
was much better, much better, di
fferent people, different looks. 
 And like I said before, the gas 
chambers were not on top of our heads, on top of
 it.  And we had experience already.  We  were 
about already a few years.  So, 
it was much easier than Auschwitz. 
 

Q: You had enough to eat?  Di
d you have enough to eat?    
 

A: Like we were– I don™t know.  We never complain
ed about the food.  Ne ver.  We  never.  You, 
you didn™t have the room to compla in, but I th
ink it was much better th
an in Auschwitz.  
Auschwitz was the worst.   
 

Q: How long were you in, do you have any sens
e of how long you were in Ravensbrück?    
 

A: I really don™t, ma ybe five months at most, I think. 

 

Q: And then how did it happen that you went from there to Switau? 

 

A: They used to take people to different camps, so
 that™s where they took us
 to Switzerland.  Uh, to 
Switau.  That™s in the Czechs, Czechoslovakia, ye s, that™s where it was. 
 

Q: And that was a camp? 

 

A: It was a camp, yeah, but they 
did not have, like I said before, th
ey did not have the gas chambers 
there.  Just working camp, you know?   But no, 
no gas chambers, no smoke comi ng out from the 
roof. 
 

Q: How ma ny of you were in that transport?   
Wa s there a large transport from Ravensbrück? 

 

A: Nine, we were nine girls.   

 

Q: Only nine girls. 

 

A: Only nine girls.  No, I mean the Jewish girls. 
 We  stayed together, we 
were only nine.  There was 
a lot of them comi ng from Ravensbrück to Switau, 
but we stayed together.  We  were, like I said 
before, the only nine Jewish girls,
 Jewish girls that were there. 
 

Q: So in Ravensbrück, you nine Jewish
 girls stuck together there, too? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
29
 
 
29
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  We  
stuck together a long time, yes, yes.   
 

Q: So when you were deported on the buses from
 Auschwitz to Ravensbrück, were those buses, 
were the people on the bus mostly non-Jewish prisoners? 
 

A: Mostly of them.  Mostly, but ma ybe there we
re a lot of Jews too, th
at we didn™t know.  You 
know what I™m saying?   But we stayed t ogether.  Yeah.  Everybody had some body that, you 

know, was holding onto some body.  And th
at™s exactly what it was.   
 

Q: What were you doing in Switau? 

 

A: The same  thing like we did in Auschwitz, nothing
 worked that you could say that you worked at 
a machine, you did some thing, some thing that 
you learned a trade or anything...  nothing like 

that.  We  just were working and digging and that
™s it.  And first, one day you digged and the 
second day you covered it.  It™s– that was the wo
rk, labor, that was nothi
ng special that you did. 
 

Q: Did you have any idea what the goal was in the 
labor?   Wa s s o me thing bei
ng built or arranged?   
Or were you in the dark about that? 
 

A: In the dark about everything.  No.  You didn™
t have a radio, you didn™
t have nothing.  You only 
depended on the, on the people that heard ne
ws.  If you passed by, you heard a radio, so you 
listened in on a word or two.  That™s what 
you–.but you didn™t have no first class news .  No, 
you did not know. 
 

Q: How were the living conditions there in Switau?  

 
A: The same  thing like in Ra vensbrück, this was th
e same thing.  It was a little more scary like I 
said because they pulled us out, you know, and we 
had to tell them.  But  
otherwise it was the 
same  conditions.   
 
Q: So people there– 

 

A: You had mo re bedrooms ma ybe.  It was a littl
e more elaborate than Auschwitz.  You had the 
water, you had to go to the bathrooms.  So this wa s– when we first came to Auschwitz, we 

didn™t have that. 
 

Q: You could clean yourself in Switau? 

 

A: In Switau, yes, you were able to do that. 

 

Q: You could– every day 
could you clean yourself? 
 

A: Every day, yes, yes, you could 
clean yourself, yes.  They had a big washroom ma ybe three time s 
as big as that room, for the ladies, for the wome
n to go into.  So they had a basin and they had 
soap.  You could wash yourself around, yes.  Yea
h, it meant a lot.  Because, well, you liked to 
stay clean, that™s what it™s 
all about, it mean
s a lot to you.

Q: Was it all women there in Switau? 

 

A: Yes, all wome n.  There was no me
n there.  There was no me n there. 
 

Q: Do you have any sense of 
how ma ny people werethere? 
 

A: Oh, thousands, I™m sure.  Thousands, I™m sure.  But it was not comparing to Auschwitz.  No.  
None of them could you compare to Auschwitz. 
 Mm- mm.  The me n™s camps some  of them you 
could comp are, like Dachau or another one
, say you could compare to Auschwitz.  But 
Auschwitz was the worst. 
 

Q: You me ntioned a little earl
ier and I didn™t fully understand... 
 you were talking about how you 
were tryi ng to conceal your Jewish identity, you 
and the other girls.  So when you arrive d in 

Switau, people, the camp authorities di
dn™t know that you were Jewish?    
 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: Is that right, they didn™t know? 

 

A: No, they did not know.  But the Poles, of course
, they find out and they...  
they didn™t know what 
it means, the triangle.  Because the Je ws had a triangle by the number.  And they knew it.  And 

because no ma tter discreet you could be, but they 
were always on top of you.  And that™s what 

happened.  And they were very mean.  I mean, wh
at did it hurt them that some body e l se should 
rema in alive?   But that™s in their upbringing, hate
, hate, hate.  And that™s
 the way they have to 
live with them for the rest  of their lives. 
 

Q: Did that surprise you, the anti-Sem
itism that the Poles were showing? 
 

A: The Poles, everybody knows that they are very 
anti-Semite.  They had no love for us and I had 
no love for them.  I had love for the ones that
 my mother used to do 
business with, but they 
changed too, during the war.  They did.  When
 I asked for some thing else like this, ﬁWe don™t 
have it, we don™t have it.ﬂ  They
 did not go out of their way to he
lp.  But yes, a lot of them, I 
heard from s t ories, my fr iend for instance, thatthe people used to leave 
the children, like infants 
a few months old.  And they wanted to place them in a home in– by Poles, when they knew, 

they gave the money for keeping.  And the childr
en never returned back to the– I mean the 
parents didn™t survive, but the kids never returned
 back to their home, they rema ined Catholics, 
the way they raised them.   
 

Q: Did you have any sense of faith during the war years? 

 

A: A sense of what? 

 

Q: Faith. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
31
 
 
31
A: I would say that I had.  I al
ways believed that somebody above
 carries on with you.  Whatever 
happens in your life, some body™s there to, to help
 you.  Yeah, faith means a big thing to me , yes. 
 
Q: And that wasn™t destroye
d by what you saw at Auschwitz? 
 

A: I wouldn™t say that I became  more pious, you 
know, more, but I would say I™m on the same  level 
like I was.  A lot of people ma de fun out of me , t
oo.  Some  of them turned out to have no religion 
at all.  I al ways believed.  I always ke pt a kos
her home, when I was there.  After the war, up till 
today, I wouldn™t mi x certain foods, like we are 
not allowed to have cheese and meat.  I would– 
I wouldn™t touch that.  It goes ag
ainst me .  I was raised that way.  I was brought up that way.  

And that™s the way I tried to keep it.  Now I have 
my different town.  It™s 
very hard to get certain 
foods.  So I used to have separate dishes all my
 life.  I used to conduct my self very, very nice, 
didn™t mi x up anything.  Now, I don™t do that.  To 
be honest, I don™t do that. 
 But I will not, still 
not eat the meat and the dairy t
ogether.  Goes against me .   
 

Q: You said that people ma de fun of you? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: They ma de fun of 
you for having faith or–? 
 

A: For having faith. 

 

Q: In the camps ?  

 

A: No.  No, out of ca mps.  When we were– af
ter the war I™m talking.  In the camp, no, no.  After 
the war.  And those were all, we were all am
ong our own, but some  of them, like I said before, 
lost their faith completely a
nd some  of them didn™t.   
 

Q: What would they ma ke fun of you about? 

 

A: Not fun exactly, it™s fun– becau
se– ﬁOh, stop being stupid,ﬂ or 
things like that.  ﬁIt doesn™t 
mean a thing.ﬂ  You know what I™m saying?   They
 had no religion in them 
at all.  I couldn™t do 
that.  I like to go to the Te mple when a holiday 
came  along or anything that came up.  I felt that™s 
my place.  Even my husband was not a believer an
d he came out from a very pious family.  But 
he saw what™s happening, he lost it completel
y.  But I was different, I was holding onto this. 
 

Q: So when you, it was discovered that you were Je
ws, you and the other girls who were in Switau.  
The Poles told the authorities of the camp that you were Jewish. 
 

A: We were hiding that we are Je
wish.  And we were hiding and not 
telling the trut h, that™s what it 
was.  A day or two later they took us out from the 
Zahl Appell
, there where you stood there to be 
counted.  And they called out al
l the numbers.  I don™t know how 
they knew the numbers.  They 
must have pointed it out, days.  And they called 
us all out.  And we had ma de up, we figured 

some thing, because once they found us and they st
arted to ask us questions.  So, we knew right 
away that they were going to– th
ey not going to keep our secret. 
 And they were in Auschwitz 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
32
 
 
32
the same  like we were.  But those were mostly people that had, either they were, what do you 
call that, politics
3
 or– because they wouldn™t take  them Po
les just to Auschwitz, or they were 
prostitutes or whatever, some thing 
like that, that™s why they were, 
stayed in Auschwitz.  But they 
had to give out, they had to sque
al.  And that™s what happened.  Th
ey called us all out.  We were 
nine people and they started to ask questions
.  I said, you know, ﬁMy father was Jewish, my 
mother was Irish,ﬂ whatever.  And the other one sa
id her mother was Jewish, her father was not.  
Each one, we ma de up a mong ourselves that™s what
 we were going to say.  And that™s exactly 
what happened.  And they spared us the life.  They really did. 
 

Q: They believed you and they– 

 

A: They believed us. 

 

Q: Did you, did they do anything–? 

 

A: That we were mi xed, mi xed.  They used to call us 
mischling
, some thing like that, to that effect.  
Mixed ma rriages.  And it was practical because
 a lot of people did get ma rried, you know, like 
this.  But they didn™t touch us.  They didn™t do 
nothing.  Of course, we didn™t know, we were 
shivering.  But that™s what it was.  And the mi
nute they spotted us, th
ey started to ask us 
questions.  How, how, how co
me  we had the triangle?   
 

Q: Did anything happen to you after that?   
Did they do anything to–.Was there any more 
harassment from the Poles in the group? 
 

A: We stayed away from them.  We tried to stay 
away from them as far as possible.  We shouldn™t 
meet.  But of course, some ti me s you couldn™t help
 it.  You had to walk through the same  path 
like they did, but we knew exactly not to say 
anything, not to talk, you know.  Be proud and go 
on and that™s it.  And that™s right.
  No, they were very mean people, a mean machine.  That™s it.  
They had no conscience.   
 

Q: Do you remember how you found out that they had squealed? 

 

A: We didn™t find out that they squealed, but we 
understood.  Because that™s the only ones that me t 
us.  Nobody else knew us.  And that™s what happe
ned.  We knew right away.  The mi nute they 
started to ask questions about th
e triangle, we knew that we ar
e finished.  And that™s what 
happened.  Because nobody else would know that Jewish people have a triangle.  They had 

numbers just like we did, but of course they di
dn™t have–.So they compared right away and they 
knew what was going on.  Because nobody else
 would think up a thing like that. 
 

Q: What were the questions 
that– you said that during the 
Zahl Appell
 they were asking you 
questions and you responded w
ith talking about how you had– 
 

A: Mixedma rriages. 

 

Q: Mixed ma rriages.  What kinds of questions were they asking you?

A: Are you Jewish?   And I said, ﬁOf course, it™s a 
mi xed ma rriage.  My mother was gentile and my 
father was Jewish.ﬂ  And they bought it.  And all 
of us said the same  thing.  So, that™s the only 
way we could get out of it.  Because of course,Jews they didn™t keep.  They, they, I don™t know 

what they did with them.  Did they kill them back
 in the– I really can™t say, but that ™s what it 

was.  And that™s what came  to our mind to say, th
at all mi xed ma rriages.  And for that they had a 
little bit more respect, I guess.   
 

Q: Do you remember the day of liberation?    

 

A: Oh, sure.  I reme mber like now.  Everything 
that happened in my lif
e, I™m always in the 
bathroom.  Any exciteme nt.  I™ m always ___________.  And all of a sudden you hear screaming.  

It was a lot of hills, in Switau, I mean in the 
Czechs, a lot of hills.  So everybody started to 

scream, ﬁThe Americans are here!  The American
s are here!ﬂ  What you 
heard them comi ng with 
motorcycles up the hill, you know, up and down, a lot 
of them.  And they were wearing ma sks, 
like to see through, the dust shouldn
™t go into their eyes, I guess, 
and mout h.  I mean, that™s the 
way I assumed.  And they all came  to a certain spot.  Like in the mi ddle of the– and they, and 

they stopped.  And they announced that the Amer
icans– that they are the Americans and they 
came to liberate us.  And we shouldn™t be afraid.  
And of course, they had 
the business of picking 
up the Germans, too, that watched us.  And I ran 
out from the bathroom with my pants down and 
I came to the spot and I pulled it up.  And it was like
 a mi racle, like, like you see it in the movies.  
You couldn™t, you couldn™t see it otherwise, and 
unbelievable too, that we are free.  And they 
said to us, ﬁWe ca me  to liberate you.  Be ver
y, very careful not–ﬂ Šthis was on the second or 
on the third day, I reme mberŠ ﬁnot to pick up 
any food and conserves.ﬂ 
 They had a lot of 
things, the German, in jars.  And we shouldn™t ea
t no meat, because our stomachs are not used to 

it, because a lot of people fell and they died from 
it.  And we should be very careful, if possible, 
we should mostly eat rice and drink wa ter.  And th
ey were just like, like 
sisters and brothers we 
found.  And among of them was a chaplain and he
 said to us, not to us, to everybody, to the 
whole camp, whoever is Jewish should come  for w
ard.  And we were stil
l hesitating, because we 
didn™t trust anybody already.  And a fe
w mi nutes later we stepped out, 
all of us.  He said not to 
be afraid, they™ll try to help us
 in every way.  And this was a 
few days later, about two, three 
days later, ma ybe.  And that we shouldn™t go b
ack to Poland like I said before, because the 
Russians are there already.  Everything was alrea
dy arranged.  And that they™ll help us and 
everybody from a mong t he nine of us had fa mily in the United States, so
 we should come  to, go 
to Paris and fr om there the organizations w
ill take over.  And they™ll fi nd the family. 
 

Q: What language was he speaking? 

 

A: Yiddish. 

 

Q: Yiddish. 

 

A: This was a chaplain fr om the Army. 

 

Q: Did you speak English at all?

34
A: Hello and good-bye.  (Laughing.)   No, I did not
.  I spoke Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish and that™s 
it.  I didn™t speak English at that time.  And they
 brought us to Paris and like I said before the 
organizations took over and Rothschild gave us a hot
el and that™s where we 
stayed until we left 
Paris. 
 

Q: So how long did you stay in
 Switau after the liberation? 
 

A: In Switau maybe three or four days. 

 

Q: What was your physical condition like at that time?  

 

A: I don™t know.  The impact in you was driv
ing you, you know, you were healthy, but underneath 
you were not healthy, because when I came to Pari
sŠthis was months laterŠI used to go and I 
used to fall, had no strength in my legs.  But 
at that point, I wa s str
ong like a bull, I didn™t, you 
know, that drive, that drives you to do, to surviv
e, and to go on.  And after a while when you find 
out that™s when it all starts.  You find out th
at you have nobody and you get disappointed and it™s 
harder to take.  But with a little help fr om your 
fri e nds– that™s what it did.  Like my friend, the 
one that™s in England,  I got very depressed afte
r while when I knew that this one is leaving and 

that one is leaving and I™m stay
ing, I™m going to rema in alone in Paris.  And I didn™t want to go 
out.  I didn™t want to see anybody and– and I di
dn™t care.  That everything was finished, and 
there™s nothing more to go–

Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: Continuation of an interview with Justin Lerner. 
 This is tape number th
ree, side A.  You were 
talking about being in Paris? 
 
A: Yes.  And I started to get very depressed a
nd didn™t want to go on.  There was no use in life 
already.  And then my fr iend, that she™s now in 
England, said to me , ﬁYou know, I™m s ure that 
the mother™s wish was some body should survive. 
 And you are the one that survived and if you 

don™t want to go on, open up the window and throw 
yourself out and get it over with.  But don™t 
ma ke everybody mi serable and yourself.ﬂ  And this 
few words put so mu ch sense into my mi nd.  
I took a turn around and I said, ﬁShe
™s right, I™ve got to go on.  I™v
e got to do it for them.ﬂ  And 
that™s the way I live all my life.  That they woul
d want me to be that 
way.  And that™s it.   
 

Q: Did you feel a lot of anger after the war ended, 
at the Germans?   Or at the world?   Or at 
anybody?   What did–. 
 

A: Anger was not the word for it.  Disgraced. 
 Anger, I knew I can do nothing, but how could 
people live like that?   To do that, one to anot
her?   This was hard to understand.  And to kill 

everybody, not to have anybody.  To be
 alone in the whole world.  
That™s what bugged.  But we 
all of us had the same  thing, the same  actually lo
okout on life.  You got to
 build, you got to start 
from scratch and be productive and do what your 
parents wanted you to do.  And that™s exactly 
how I went on all my life like that. 
 

Q: Do you– go ahead. 

 

A: The, the will to live and to carry on and to br
ing a new people into this
 world, that™s what we 
tried to.  And to help one anothe
r.  And we very seldom spoke a
bout anything like that.  Took us 
years.  When they erected the monume nt in, in 
Washington, so we went to Wa shington.  And we  

went like eight or nine friends.  And I reme mb
er being at the cemetery, Arlington Ce me tery in 
Washington.  And– and we had a lot of soldiers 
down there, came to, interviewed us.  They had 
the American flag going around and they had people
 from the me dia.  And in the back of me , 
they had, they were taking pictur es and they were talking, speeches.  And there was a big, heavy 

cable.  And all of a sudden a young gentlema n touches me  and he says to me , be careful.  I 

shouldn™t go back, because the cable, I™ll fall.  And the answer was I cannot fall anymore.  I was 

fallen enough.  And somehow, that youngster, I will ne
ver forget hi m, di d not disappear from us.  

And he started to ma ke conversations.  And he
 ask us, where do we go from here?   From the 
cemetery?  And I told hi m, we are going to the 
Capital that time.  And 
he says, ﬁCould I come  
along with you? ﬂ  I says, ﬁ What are you, 
you know, hanging around us?   Some body send you?ﬂ  
And it turned out that– I said, 
ﬁDo you go to school?   Do you go to college?   Do you have to 
write thesis?ﬂ  I– we couldn™t understand.  He to
ok us by train home , because he had a– he had 
a small car, so we couldn™t go in, all of us, into 
the car.  So left the car where it was pa rked on 
the cemetery, not far from there and he took us by
 train to go to the Wa shington, to the, where 
the  monument is going to be erected.  Because 
he  asked us, where do we have to go?  And for 
the first time we went on a train.  A beautiful tr
ain in Wa shington.  And then we went to the 
Capitol.  We  had lunch there and we paid for 
his lunch.  And he wanted
 to spend with us a 
whole, a whole evening, but we were going from 
there on.  But he found us so interesting.  And

he was in law school and wanted, like you, and he 
wanted to know more and more about it.  But 
he was a very nice gentlema n.  He had company t hat
 night comi ng, so he coul
dn™t stay with us in 
the evening, because we had everyt hing set up for 
us.  You know we were there for three days.  
But it was ve ry interesting.  And– and that™s it. 
 And that– because he wanted to know more 

and more and more.  How do we fee l  out of lif
e?  How do– our outlook on life.  I said, ﬁIt™s 
time to cry and it™s time to love, and that™s th
e way it goes.  Time for life and time to– and 
that™s it.  That™s our motto.  You got to go ontill the end, there™s no alte
rnative.  You can™t go 
backwards.  You got to go forward.ﬂ 
 

Q: You me ntioned earlier, that you we
re staying in a 
hotel in Paris? 
 

A: Yes, Paris, Rothschild gave us the hotel. 

 

Q: Do you remember the name  of the hotel, by any chance? 

 

A: It was on Rue Giparteau 
(ph )
.  That was the address.  And this was Rothschild gave this to us, 
without charge, no mone y, no nothing.  Yes. 
 

Q: Were you still with all of your friends, the girls? 

 

A: All of my friends, yes.  We were
 there, yes, but like I said, I rema
ined the last one.  They all left  
before me .  And it was– it was nice, I mean, 
it was livable.  We  had– everybody had the same .  
You had two beds in every room and a bathro
om, which was very nice.  And of course, no 
charge, because we had no money to pay them. 
 And we got the meals downstairs and– and 
those were your headquarters.  If you had to go 
to– and a lot of times people came, helping you, 
asking you questions.  ﬁWhere are you from?   What
 was your fa mily name?ﬂ  Reporters.  ﬁHow 
ma ny in your fa mily? ﬂ   You know. 
 All kinds of questions till 
you get tired of answering, too.  
And nothing came out of it.  And then towards the 
end, I didn™t want to talk about it, because it 
brings too much hurt in you.  And one night, I 
ma ke– I was sitting in my room and I think it 
was with Halina, yeah, or ma ybe she went dow
n, I was alone.  And all of a sudden I heard 
screaming on the corridor.  And I said, ﬁOh my
 God, the Germans ca me  back? ﬂ   You didn™t 
know.  You were like a lamb.  I said, ﬁ What™
s going on? ﬂ  Fi nally I opened up the door.  I 
wanted to see what was going on.  And there wa
s my husband, at that time  I didn™t know hi m 
yet, and kissing my two friends, 
the two sisters.  And they were
 crying and screaming and they 
introduced me  to hi m.  ﬁThis is
,ﬂ how did they call it?   ﬁA 
landsman
,ﬂ this means from the same  
town.  And they me t hi m.  He came l ooking for pe
ople that survived.  He
 heard that there was 
people there and he was still in the Ar my and that™s
 when he came  over.  So, they introduced me  
to him and I went into the house, to my room
 and I said ﬁGood night, nice knowing you,ﬂ and I 
left.  And he used to come  to them every single
 day.  He used to bring them soap, a piece of 
chocolate and sardines.  And if they had too muc
h, they gave it to me .  They shared with me  a 
little bit, which was very nice of
 them.  And that™s when I found out mor e  about it.  And a short 
time later, they left.  They went to South Amer
ica, to Paraguay, which they had fa mily there.  
And at this point everything was ready and they
 left.  And my husband came  around a few times, 
but I didn™t pay no attention to him.  And thenhe was discharged from 
the Army and he went 
back to the States.  And he came in twice more
.  And the girls had ma de up with me , the two 
sisters, they knew I had nobody.  At 
that point I didn™t find my uncle 
yet– that if I want to come

to South America where they are, they have a brothe
r, that is, that is, his 
wi fe was left in Poland.  
He left before the war, and the wife didn™t get a 
chance to go out.  And that they would want me  
very much in the family.  And that™s when all 
the trouble started.  And I said, that™s nice, that 
was very nice of them.  But of course, they m
eant more for themselves than for me.  And then 
my husband, I told him the story about what happened and after a while he came out and he told 
me the truth.  They had mentioned to me that 
he was ma rried before the war and they had one 
child.  And my husband knew that he had two chil
dren.  And he must have been old like my 
fat her. 
 

Q: I™m sorry, who was ma rried before the war? 

 

A: The two fr iends, the two sister s that left  for S
outh America, to Paraguay.  This was their brother 
and they wanted me  for a sister
-in-law.  And they think I didn
™t have anybody and they knew me  
from concentration camp.  So, they wanted me , 
I should come  out to them.  And they have a 
brother that the wife didn
™t– did not survive.  And they wanted me , I should– 
 

Q: They thought they could ma ke a ma tc h. 

 

A: –a ma tch.  So, I didn™t know anything.  So, I sa
id, ﬁLet him write to me  and we™ll see later 
what™s going to be.ﬂ  But I never got a letter fr
om them.  I only got telegrams.  I should come  out 

there.  And they send, they bought me the pa
ssage to go and everything and like a dummy, I 
didn™t know from nothing.  I™m going to Paraguay. 
 

Q: What were the name s of
 your friends in Paraguay? 
 

A: Sure, Sonja and what was the other one?   Sonja Br aun 
(ph )
, Braun is her name .  And what was 
the other one?   I can™t 
reme mber her name .   
 

Q:  That™s okay. 

 

A:  Maybe it™s going to come  back to me  like be
fore, but right now I can™t
 think of her name .   
 

Q:  That™s okay. 

 

A:  And that they want me  t here very, very much. 
 And like I sa id, ﬁTell him to write to me  and we™ll 
see what™s going to be.  Or send 
a picture on top of it.ﬂ  But this
 never materialized.  I only got 
like right away telegrams and telegrams and that
 they™re ma king out the papers.  And they™re 
going to send me – I have to go and get a visa
.  And they™re going to pay for the fare and 
everything.  They knew I had no money.  And then
 when my husband came back and he asked 
me, did I find my uncle.  And I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ  ﬁS
o, what are you going to do? ﬂ   I said, ﬁI™m going 
to Paraguay, that Sonja and,ﬂ oh I 
can™t think of her name , the othe
r one, ﬁwants me  there.  And 
they want me, they have a brother for me .ﬂ  And he knew the whole fa mily, what was going on.  

Then it came out a few months later,
 didn™t tell me  right away, the 
truth.  That he was ma rried, I 
said, I knew, but he had two children.  They onl
y said he had one.  And the age they didn™t tell 

me.  And he was almost the age like my father. 
 And that™s what happened.  And then, so my 

husband said to me , ﬁGi ve me  the, all the partic
ulars that you knew about 
your uncle.  Give it to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

38
me .ﬂ  I said, ﬁI™m sick and tired.  I don™t want 
it, anything else.ﬂ  The onl
y thing is I could think 
is he™s very rich, the same  speec
h, or he™s passed away.  I reme mbered the children, their name s, 
I reme mbered his name.  I reme mbered his wife
™s name .  But I  did not remember the address 
where he lived.  This my  mother told us just 
before the war broke, before we were, we were 
separated, that we should all reme mb er.  And that
™s what happened, the address I forgot where 
he lived.  And that™s what it was so hard for hi
m to find me , for me  to find him, rather.  Excuse 
me .  And the papers that he rea
d, there was a lot of Jewish papers
 them years.  So, instead of 
The 
Day
 they called it, you read 
Good Morning
.  So, I put it in this paper a
nd he read the other paper.  
So, so I gave my husband all the particulars, he we
nt back to the States.  And that™s it.  And two 
days later or three days later, I get a letter, my 
uncle.  And he sent me  
twenty dollars, he put it 
into the envelope.  But he just found out from th
e  soldier, Mr. Lerner, that I™m alive and he™s 
going send out papers for me  that I should come  
to the States here.  And being nobody survived 
with me , my  cousin, that was his sister, too.  It was one brother 
and two sisters, so I was from 
one sister and my cousin was from the other sist
er.  And he wants very, very much I should come  
to the United States.  And that™s the way it started.  
So, in the interim I, I sent him a letter.  That I 
was ma d, because I took it very wrong that he does
n™t want to acknowledge himself.  This was 
my pride, but it was not so.  He was very, you 
know, devoted and healthy, happy that I™m alive, 
that some body™s alive from the fa mily.  And interest
ed, very, I should come  and he™ll try to help 
in every way.  And that he™s sending out papers
.  But then from there instead of sending me  
letters, they sent me  telegrams.  And they bought
 me already the, the, 
everything, they paid the 
fare in for me to go by plane to South America. 
 And I started to put– and then he came  again, 
my husband.  I was over a year in Paris.  And by 
that time, he came again, once more.  He joined 
the Merchant Marines and he went back and fort
h.  And he told me – and I told him what™s on 
my mi nd.  And when he told me  that– yeah, a pi
cture came from the m.  And he was in the back.  
Because I wr ote them, ﬁI never got a pictur e, I 
never got a letter, I don™t understand what™s going 
on.  You don™t keep your promise.  I™m not going 
to keep my promise.ﬂ  You know, that™s the 
way I was talking to my– writing to my friends. 
 

Q: Your friends in Paraguay,
 you™re talking about now? 
 

A: Right, right, them two, yes.  And then I got a pict
ure from them all.  The ones that I knew.  When 
my husband came, I showed him the  picture and he sa
id that™s not him.  He was very short.  But 
they put a stool in the back, that
™s why he was in the back.  S
o, that™s when I put two and two 
together.  And I went back– yeah and between
– I had to go through Spain to go to them, 
through Spain, I had to stop in Spain.  So, I had to 
have a visa from Spain.  In the interim, Spain 
and Paris, and France didn™t– had some  kind of 
delay or whatever.  They had some  kind of 

argument.  This was right after the war and they
 wouldn™t allow anybody.  So, I had to be stuck 
again in Paris.  And that™s what happened.  I 
went back to ORT, ORT is a Jewish organization 
that they knew the whole story.  And I went back
 to them and I told them, ﬁI™m not going.ﬂ  And 
the girl said to me , ﬁ Wha t are you crazy or some
thing?   You couldn™t wait to get out of Paris 

already to go and now all of a sudden you change
 your mi nd.ﬂ  And I told her the whole story, 
what was going on.  And she said, ﬁI™m sorry.  
I cannot help you.  You™ll have to go from 

Paraguay, if you don™t like it there, 
you™ll have to go whatever you want from there.  But in the 
interim you must go.ﬂ  I said, ﬁThere is no such thi
ng with must.ﬂ  I went– I said, ﬁI want to see 
some body higher than you, different authority.  A
nd there came a gentleman and I told him the 
story.  And he says, ﬁDon™t go.ﬂ  And that™s when
 I– I had a friend in Paris that went with me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

39
with all these things.  Halina™ s fr iend, she came fr om the same  town.  And she was very nice to 
us.  She used to call us in for dinner and what
ever we had to go, she went along with us.  She 
was very, very helping.  And then
 I decided I™m not going to go. 
 And I waited in Paris and my 
husband wanted to ma rry me .  And I said, to myse
lf, ﬁOkay.ﬂ  It was over a year.  I couldn™t find 
anybody.  And we decided to get ma rried.  But in 
order for me and him, go together to the 
United States, we had to get ma rried in Paris.  So
 we had a beautiful weddi
ng in Paris, invited all 
my friends.  And after a while we came  over here. 
 

Q: Had you had any feelings for your husband before that point?  Did you –? 

 

A: Oh sure, it took me  over a year.  I didn™t want to– he was comi ng back and forth, but I didn™t 
understand what was going on.  You know what I™m sa
ying?   He had feelings, and I had feelings, 
but I wasn™t ready yet, let™s put
 it this way.  Because I was sti
ll searching and looking and once I 
promised, I didn™t want to break my promise on 
top of it.  Once I heard what he told me , I 
believed him and that™s what happened.  They 
were very nice and very good, but they wanted 
good for their brot her, too, so they wanted me . 
 Because they knew I wouldn™t have to go any 
place else.  I wouldn™t be able to ge t out.  
And that™s what happened.  But I™m happy.  Got 

ma rried already after a while and had a child, wh
ich I was very happy for the whole story.  But 
we got to see them after the war. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Oh yeah.  We went to South America.  My hus
band had a sister in Argentina.  And from there 
we went to, to see them.  I didn™t want to go, but
 my husband insisted and 
we went.  And that™s 
what happened.  And after that they came quite a few times t o New York, so they came  to see 

me , too. 
 

Q: Did you talk to your husband about what had ha
ppened to you during the 
war?   Did you tell him 
stories?  
 

A: Oh sure, all along, sure.  He
 knew everything, because he only
 hung out with people that lived 
through the war, because we were always together. 
 

Q: You me ntioned, did he, was he born in the 
United States or  wa
s he born in Europe? 
 

A: No, he was thirteen years old, that he came to, his 
fat h er was, l e ft  before, fi
ve years prior to that.  
And then he came with the rest of the fa mily. 
 

Q: Where was his family fr om? 

 

A: The same  place where my girlfriends, my two fr
iends.  Wher e was he born?  Not too far from 
Bia
ystok.  Oh God, your mi nd escapes you.  
om
*
a.  
om
*
a.  That™s not too far from Bia
ystok.  
That™s where he was raised and born, down there. 
 His mothe r  was still in Europe.  His father 
was in the United States.  So he went to visit 
her in 1939, just before th
e wa r broke out.  And 
that™s when he me t all these people again, because  
they were from the same town and they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
40
 
 
40
very close.  So, when the war ended, that™s when
 he me t them in Paris.  He came  searching.  
That™s exactly where he met them.   
 
Q: Was your husband the first ma n that you had ev
er dated, or had ever been involved with 
romantically?   
 

A: I would say we went out in Poland, actually, befo
re the war broke out.  Like I said, I belonged to 
the Jabotinski, to the– but yes,
 to be exactly, yes.  Yeah. 
 

Q: Was that difficult for you to be, becomi
ng involved with someone after having gone through 
what you had just been through?    
 

A: Well, I was not, not like toda
y the girls, they go and they sl
eep with their me n.  We didn™t do 
these things.  I would never do that. 
 Had to wait to get married in or
der to be near each other.  I 
stayed at Rue Giparteau 
(ph )
 and he was in a hotel.  But it was, you have to trust some body in 
order to, to be honest with some body, I m
ean.  You look nice and you look good and had all 
kinds of promises, and that™s what happened. 
 

Q: You had lost so much of your childhood a
nd of your teenage years,
 that young wome n are 
norma lly, you know–  
 

A: Wild, and– yes. 

 

Q: –just learning about 
each other and having fun. 
 

A: No, we didn™t have that, defi
nitely not.  We  did not have 
that.  We  had no, a broken childhood, 
actually.  That™s what it was.  Ye
s, and that™s why when I see a ki
d of twelve, thirteen years old, 
including my grand-daughter doing 
the hair, streaking.  I say, ﬁIs that necessary?ﬂ  I can™t see it 
for dust.  I cannot see it.  Because we were–I didn™t put on lipstick until my wedding day.  Did 

not.  Now I cover all up all the things.  (Laughin
g.)  But them years?   No.  Never smoked, never 
did anything like that. 
 

Q: Had you had a fantasy of getting ma rri
ed?   Had you ever 
thought about it? 
 

A: Yeah, a fantasy, of course.  But you didn™t talk 
about it.  It™s not like 
over here, you talk to your 
friends.  ﬁThis happened, that™– 
no, we didn™t– I was not of that
 age, you know, to talk about 
things like that.  Because like I said, I had young
er, older sisters than me .  But no, I didn™t have 
such fantasies, no, like the kids today, no.   My fa
ntasy was just to bring in food in the house and 

we should have what to eat, and– and we should 
all be together.  This was my childhood.  It™s 
different. 
 

Q: What about your hopes and dreams for yourself
 after the war and you got over your depression 
and you ma de the decision that you were going 
to go on living your life?   Did you want to 

continue your education?   Or did you want to 
have children?  What was the thing that was in 
your–?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
41
 
 
41
A: The education, at that point, I di d not go, because
 you started to build a life for yourself.  And of 
course, I wanted to go have a child.  And we were
 just starting out, so it
 was not actually for me  
to go to school.  That™s the way I looked at it. 
 I just wanted to help my husband and build a 
home .  And I used to go to school
 at night, night school 
they had them years.  And I was helping 
my husband.  We  were working like hand to hand,
 and to become somebody, to make something 
out of yourself.  And then we wanted to have a 
baby, so it took me  almost  seven years until I had 
my son.  And this was a big thing, because all my
 friends had children already.  So, it™s another 
thing.  But thank God, he was born and I was very 
proud of him.  And he was the whole life to 
me  and to my husband, both of us.  And we only sa
w that he should have a better life than we 
did.  And he should go to college and he should 
be some body.  That™s it.  That was my ma in 
thing. 
 

Q: Before we go on to that, when you were in 
Paris and you had the opportu
nity to come  to the 
U.S., had you had any thoughts before that 
or any dreams of going to Palestine? 
 

A: No.  I– my cousin went to Palestine, b
ecause she was younger than me , ten years.  And she 
went with a child™s transport from Pa ris.  And 
I wa nted to go with her very, very muc h, because 
once I found her, I didn™t want to
 let go.  And especially I was ol
der.  And, but I couldn™t go, 
because this was just a child™s tran
sport.  So, I said to myself, I c
ould always go to Israel later on.  
So, I rema ined in Paris and she went on to Is
rael.  But at the end, 
I brought her here.  She 
finished her schooling.  She was in a kibbutz. 
 And she finished her schooling, she became  a 
nurse, and then I took her here.  But she was sic
k.  I didn™t even know.  It was not an easy life, 
not easy, because she saw her mothe r  gassing.  They 
put her in the twenty-fif
th block they called 
it, when they got her.  And she noticed the 
smoke comi ng out right away.  They gassed her. 
 

Q: InAuschwitz? 
 
A: In Auschwitz, and she couldn™t c
ope with it.  I didn™t know at that 
point.  At that point we were 
all the same.  But when she went to Israel, and th
at™s when it all came  out.  She was lonely, and I 
brought her to me .  And she stayed with me  a wh
ile, but she, she did not 
listen.  I thought she 
was mean, but she was sick already.  What did Iknow about me ntal heal
th?   I didn™t know about 
all these things.  And then I marri
ed her off, but she did not stay with me  anymore.  She, she 
moved out.  She went to my uncle–

Q: Tape three, side B of an interview with Justine Lerner. 

 

A: And she went to my aunt, to my uncle™s house, to
 stay with them for a while.  But of course I had 
said to my aunt, ﬁCall me  one night.ﬂ  And sh
e came, when I brought her, I was pregnant with 

my son.  And like I said before
, it took me  seven years almos t .  And she– when he was born– I 
was ma ybe in my ninth month already when she got 
over here, and if I said to her, ﬁI want to 
spend more time with the kids.ﬂ  She came– I got 
her a job to work in a hospital, but not as a 
nurse, as a nurse™s aide, because she didn™t have 
the diploma.  And they wouldn™t acknowledge it 
at that time  from Israel, all the years, you had to 
go through a test, which she wasn™t ready for it.  

And no ma tter what I said, she took it, everything 
she took wrong.  If I said day, she said night.  
No ma tter what, how I tried, no ma tter what I did.
  If I jumpe d off the roof, she would keep– 
but I didn™t know like, she was si
ck.  Couldn™t understand.  When I 
slept, she used to come  into 
me  in the bed.  She was scared.  She used to come
 in to sleep with us.  And I said to myself, 

what™s going on here?   So, I took her to a doctor,
 took her to a fa mily doctor, of course.  Who 
knew about psychiatrists them years?  And he prescr
ibed a pill and she took it and that™s it, but it 
was not enough.  She needed more than that.  So
 I got her a– a room on my block and said, 
ﬁYou could come  to eat by me , but not, not sleeping.ﬂ
  And that™s exactly how it was.  And then 

she, she was keeping company, already she me t a 
nice fellow.  But she had a hard life, she did 
not know what–.She had one, what do they call th
at?   One attack after 
the other.  She wound up 
in a me ntal hospital.  And she couldn™t deal w
ith life.  And that was 
a very big strain on me , 
punishing myself, what I didn™t know.  I didn™t kn
ow what was going on.  A
nd I couldn™t be to 
her a mother and I couldn™t be to her the fath
er.  I could only be like 
the way I am, warm and, 
and everything else.  Caring.  But she didn™t buy 
it.  She didn™t– she didn™t understand.  She 
didn™t have a happy life.  She had a wonderful hus
band, a good, educated ma n.  But she, herself, 
didn™t live the way it™s supposed to, and she left
 two children.  The boy I™m very– very, very 
nice, and the girl is just like the mo m.  
 

Q: This is the same  cousin that you me n
tioned earlier, you were in Auschwitz with? 

 

A: Right, right.   

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Right, right.  And th
at™s the way it went on. 
 

Q: How did you get from Paris, how and when 
did you get from Paris to the United States? 
 

A: In ‚47, 1947.  We  got married a
nd then we came to, to the States. 
 

Q: Did you come  by ship? 

 

A: No, we ca me by plane.  I came by ship.  (Laughi
ng.)  They, they were transporting the soldiers 
back home.  But being I was a G.I. bride, so I 
had the same  privileges, but of course, you had to 
wait for a boat.  So one day my husba nd goes down to get a paper and he come s back and he

shows me  that the boat that we™re 
supposed to goŠit was Marine Flasher 
(ph )
ŠI re member it 
like now, got a– on fire in the, in the dock. 
 And I thought he was ki
dding me .  I thought he 
wasn™t telling me  the truth.  So I 
looked at the picture.  I didn™t 
know how to read.  So I looked at 
the picture and that™s exactly how it was.  And th
en we had to wait threemonths for another ship, 
for another boat.  And on one side I reme mber wa
s the me n, and on the other side was the ladies, 

gated off, you know.  And I was not a good, I couldn™t 
take the ship.  I was very sick, dizzy and 
sea sick, couldn™t take the water.
  And I was laying more than I, than I wa s walking around.  And 
he tried to bring me  food.  And there was a ma tr
on watching us and she took a look at the tray.  
He put down from everything, this was a joke. 
 Put down from everything and the ma tron took a 
look at it and she says, ﬁIf you bri
ng her so much food, she™s not sick
 enough to get up and eat.ﬂ  
(Laughing.)  So– but instead of going, we were s
upposed to go like nine da
ys or ten, we went 
fifteen days.  It was a broken up ship and was– got
 filled full of water.  We thought we going to 
drown.  And then they fixed it in Halifax 
and then we came t o the United States.   
 

Q: Was it a U.S. military ship? 

 

A: It had to be.  I don™t think she wa
s in use in the military or they re
tired her.  But that™s what they 
took and that™s what we came back.  Yeah.  It
 was not a luxury ship, that™s for sure.   
 

Q: What were your expectations of the United 
States or your ideas a
bout it before you came ?  
 

A: Before I came , drea mi ng, just tall buildings, 
you know, to see, how different would it be?   How 
would people accept me?  My husband had a father, 
that we lived together.  And he was very, 
very nice to me .  I adored that ma n.  He was a 
very nice, pious ma n, very lovely and respectful, 
very respectful.  And it was just a pleasure to be 
with him.  We moved into him.  And he wanted 
to give us everything, whatever 
he had.  He wanted to give 
us his room.  There were two 
bedrooms.  I says, ﬁPa, how could I take your bedr
oom?   It™s yours.ﬂ  So, we slept the two of us, 
his bedroom was big and to the front, ours wa
s like in a driveway.  But I was happy that 
some body a ccepted us and I was very grateful.  
And you go on with your, whatever you have to 
do.  I went down in the morning to get breakf
ast, it was local, on the same block, a grocery, 
today you don™t see it.  Today you have supermarkets
, big ones.  That time everything was, and 

from the beginning when I went into the store ev
erybody gave me  their next.  And then I figured 
out why, because they wanted to see if I have horn
s.  (Laughing.)  If I– how do I speak.  It was 
a pleasure.  I didn™t have to wait 
on lines, but it didn™t last long. 
 Because after a while they heard 
that I™m the same like they are, 
so they let me  go to wait in line
.  And I used to shop, and bring 
home the food, and make three meals a day, and it 
was just like my mother did, the same  thing. 
 

Q: Where did you live?  Where was this? 

 

A: On Newport Street, 448 Newport St
reet in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  It wa
s a nice area.  You were able 
to get a bus and a train.  Y
ou know what I™m saying?    
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: They didn™t have so ma ny cars like they have 
now.  You mus t  have a car, otherwise you can™t 
move.  No s uch thing.

Q: And when you said people wanted to see wh
ether you had horns, were you talking about people 
who were– 
 

A: American, they were born here.   

 

Q: Non-Jews? Or– 

 

A: They were Jewish, too, yes. 

 

Q: They just had stereotypes a
bout Holocaust survivors?   Or ? 
 

A: They didn™t have a stereo– I 
don™t know if they have stereotypes.  I wouldn™t say that.  But I 
ma de up that joke.  That™s the way it was going on.  
That they wanted to see if I have horns, how 
do I talk, how do I move myself 
diffe rent than they are.  Cu
riosity I would say more than 
anything else.  But then when they found out that 
I™m just like them, they didn™t let me go ahead 

of them anymore.  I had to wa
it in line.  And that™s it.  
 

Q: Did you  feel that anyone, did anyone 
discrimi nate against you in any way? 
 

A: No, I can™t say that.  I didn™t 
find it.  I never had that feeling, 
no, no.  My friends had that feeling, 
a lot of them, but I never had that feeling. 
 I never felt any differe
nt than they are. 
 

Q: Your friends had the feeling that they were di
scrimi nated against because 
they were survivors or 
because they were Jewish? 
 
A: Oh, they were Jewish, because they were survivor
s.  They mixed with di fferent kind of people.  I 
really don™t know.  A lot of them fe
lt that way.  I never did that.  I 
never felt that way.  I felt I™m 
the same  like them, not any better, not any wors
e.  I™m the same  platfor m that they are. 
 
Q: When did you start to learn English? 

 

A: A short time, right away, right 
away I would say, when I came  to the States.  They had at night, 
the night school.  Thoma s  Jefferson was the school
, I reme mber.  And I said if I want to live 
here, I have to learn.  Have to learn to read and 
write and that™s what I di
d.  I went at night.  And 
one day I came  home and I see the light is on, 
because my fat her-in-law™s windows were to the 
front.  And as I was walking home, a nd I see– I got
 scared.  I said, I hope 
he feels all right.  And 
I come  upstairs.  We  lived on the first floor.  A
nd I come upstairs and he™s
 sitting and learning.  I 
says, ﬁPa, what are you doing?   Do
 you feel all right?   What™s the ma tter?ﬂ  ﬁWell, I™m jealous 
on you,ﬂ he says.  ﬁYou™re here such a short tim
e and you™re learning Eng
lish.  I want to learn, 
too.ﬂ  And that™s when he got one of my books 
and he was sitting and reading English.  I thought 
it was so cute. 
 

Q: Did you speak Yiddish with him?  

 

A: Yeah.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
45
 
 
45
 
Q: And with your husband? 

 

A: Yes.  Yes. 

 

Q: Did your husband speak Polish? 

 

A: Broken up, very broken up, not 
grammatisch
4
, like they say.  Not like the– how do you say.  
Like with the ABC.  I don™t know how
 to express myself to say it.   
 

Q: He didn™t speak fluently. 

 

A: Fluent, yeah.  Not only fluent
ly, but not, if a ma n, he would say it™s a woma n, you know, you use 
the same  phrase.  You know what 
I™m saying?   But very poorly.   
 

Q: Back to your journey, just 
briefly, do you reme mber your firs
t impressions?   Did you see the 
Statue of Liberty as you we
re approaching the harbor? 
 

A: Oh yes, saw the Statue of Libert
y.  I saw, at that point, was Elli
s Island, them years, but of course 
I didn™t see– the tall buildings amazed me  very, 
very muc h, just to keep it up.  And we had 
somebody picking us up from the, from the boat a
nd that™s it.  And my husband took me  to, to 
his friends.  I mean not right away, but days after 
and we all became like friends.  I fitted in right 

away, they did like me  very much.  And that™s th e way we rema ined friends all our lives.  I had a 

good life.  And if it wasn™t good, you have to ma ke
 it good.  That™s my mo tto.  You got to ma ke 
good. 
 
Q: Did you talk to people about 
your experiences during the war? 
 

A: No, never.   

 

Q: Did you ever want to? 

 

A: Uh uh, didn™t want to.  I didn™t 
want to be different than anybody else.  I wa s always wa nted to 
be like some body else.  The number, 
couldn™t live with it.  I had to take it out.  And I did and I 
was very happy.  And once I took it out, I™m like 
everybody else.  You don™t know what™s in my 
heart, but on the outside I l
ook alike.  If I open up my m
outh, of course you™ll see I™m a 
foreigner, but I was never ashame d of being a fo
reigner.  But I couldn™t live with the number, 
because this made me di fferent than everybody el
se.  This I couldn™t accept.  So, when my son 
started to go to school, I 
said, that™s when I™ll take it off.  An
d exactly I did that.  And like I said 
before, I– if you ask me, ﬁOh that™s what th
e ___________?ﬂ  No, this is my number and I™m 
very proud of it.  In the hospital, whenever I wa
s, that™s my number.  If some body rang the bell 
and it was in the morning, I could open up thedoor in a house dress or my nightgown, but I 

could not, would not let you see my number.  Had 
to take a dish towel from the kitchen or 
something to put it on top.  It was like unacceptable 
in my, in my life.  I can™t do it.  One time a 
child caught me  and she asked me , ﬁWhat is that
? ﬂ   And I told her, ﬁOh it™s my telephone

 German: grammatical.

46
number.ﬂ  I always found an excuse, I figured 
how the age, how she™s going to accept  it.  Of 
course, she didn™t accept that, she understood 
some thing.  She says, ﬁNobody puts a telephone 
number,ﬂ but I said, ﬁI don™t reme mber, so I didn™t 
want to lose it.  So, th
at™s why I put it there.ﬂ  
But you couldn™t catch me  the second time already w
ithout anything.  I used 
to put on a tape to 
cover it if I had to go out.  All the time until I 
took it off.  It was like a, I don™t know, it was like a 
disbelief, a hurt.  Not everybody felt the same  way lik
e me.  A lot of my frie
nds still have it, but I 
just couldn™t live with it.  I took 
it differently.  And that™s it. 
 

Q: Did you talk to your son about
 your, did you talk to your son a
bout your experiences during the 
Holocaust? 
 

A: I didn™t talk to him directl
y, let™s put it this way, to sit down like I™m sitting down with you and 
talking about it.  Here and ther
e I had the picture together.  Be
cause he always saw me  crying.  
Like a holiday came, any occasion 
and it hurted him.  I remember 
when my son was six, five or 
six years old.  And he came into the house and 
I don™t know, I was sitting 
and crying.  It had to 
be some  kind of a holiday, because this was the wo
rst time of my life, not to have family sit at 

the tabl e, just  the three of us.  It was very hard
 for me, because like I said before, I was– I had a 

big family and warm fa mily, and I was mi ssing it a 
lot.  And he said to me, ﬁWhat™s the matter?   
What happened?ﬂ  ﬁNothing happened, Joel.  I don™
t feel good.  I™m just crying.  Everything is 
okay.ﬂ  And I wouldn™t tell him.  He took me  ar
ound and he said to me , ﬁMa, when I get bigger 
I™m going to ma rry you, don™t cry.ﬂ  (Laughing.)  
I never forgot that.  And boys have like 
protected me then already.  You know what I™m 
saying?   But he knew, I™m sure that he knows 
everything, what went on.  Here 
and there he heard it.  But I 
never sat down, like I™m sitting 
down with you and telling, never. 
 

Q: What ma de you want to
 tell your story now?    
 

A: I™m getting on in age.  Kids are learning in sc
hool about it.  My gra
nddaughter went to Poland.  
The March of the Living, for the March of Livi
ng.  And she preaches in school and college, now.  
She tells everybody the story.  And she™s very much 
into it.  And I said, ﬁWhat the heck, let me  
tell my story, too.ﬂ  And that™s it.  I always 
said they have enough without me , but I guess each 
and everyone brings a diffe
rent story to it.   
 

Q: That™sright. 

 

A: And that™s what it™s all about. 

 

Q: Are there certain things, that you, even though y
ou didn™t talk about it, are there things that 
you– did you think a lot about it 
over the years in your own 
mi nd?   Were there images– 
 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: –that haunted you?   Or
 did you have nightma res? 
 

A: Oh yes.  Nightma res I didn™t have.  I am blesse
d, what I think, that a lo
t of people don™t want to 
believe me .  Even when they attacked me .  I don™
t have no nightmares.  I™m not scared.  This is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
47
 
 
47
something in me, that I have no nightmares.  My
 husband used to have nightma res.  My friends 
told me  that their husbands had nightma res, but 
I never had nightma res.  No, I can™t say that. 
 
Q: But you did think a lot about that time in your own mi nd? 

 

A: Oh sure.  Oh, in my own mi nd, all my  life, I live
 with it.  Li ke I said before, mostly holidays was 
very painful.  And feeling sorry for myself and 
hating myself.  Why did I have to be the one to 
survive?   But there™s no answer for me .  That™s 
the way God wanted it and 
that™s what it™s all 
about. 
 

Q: Did you talk to anybody about t
hose feelings?   Was there any 
way?   Any release for them?  
 

A: No.  no.  I was always able to solve my probl
ems.  I never spoke to 
anybody, no.  I was a strong 
woma n, very strong.   
 

Q: Tell me  about your, what your husband did as 
a profession in the years that you spent in 
Brooklyn.  Initially, how did he build his own life? 
 

A: My husband was in the real estate, not the bi g buildings, of course, but multiple dwellings, that  
they called it.  It was– we bought a house, 
an apartment building, four bedrooms, three 
bedrooms a nd he held that house.  
He did alterations.  They fixed it.  A lot of them were closed 

up.  You brought them back to life. And not in th
e best areas, in the– for the poor people, let™s 
put it this way.  Middle class, no, 
it was lower than mi ddle class.  And it was working them.  He 
went for the plumber, he went for the electr
ician.  He brought them back to life, those 
apartments.  And that™s the way he used to used
 to build them up.  Them years if you put in a 
new gas range or you put in radiators they had in 
the walls for the heat, so you got a raise.  And 
that™s the way he was working it.  And fromthis he ma de, from one house, then he bought 

another house, then he bought another house and 
paid the bank the mortgages, and– and I took 
care on it.  And that was his job.  And I used to 
take the complaints in 
the house.  So, this was 
my job.  And that™s the way we built it up.  He used
 to come home for lunch and dinner.  We had 
a real family life. 
 

Q: Did you feel like, you we re talking a little b
it earlier about how it was 
important for you to not 
feel different than everybody el
se.  Did you feel, did you come  to
 feel like you belonged in this 
country and that you were an American? 
 

A: Yes.  I never had that– I felt I™m just as 
good as everybody else.  All my life I felt like that. 
 

Q: When did you become  a n American citizen? 

 

A: Right away ma ybe, I think it was a year, a year a
nd a half after.  I didn™t have to wait the five 
years.  So, I went and I passed the test.  Yeah. 
 

Q: Was it a significant event for you to get your Am
erican citizenship?   Wa s that important, an 
important, me morable occasion? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
48
 
 
48
A: Yes, it was.  I was very proud of
 my self that I made it.  And I 
always felt if you live in a country, 
you have to be able to know what™s going on.  Qu
ite a few times I went, they called me for jury 
duty.  And I told them, I says, ﬁCan™t you get 
some body better, more educated than me?ﬂ  And 
they said, ﬁNo.  You ha ve a brain, you™re using 
it, that™s what™s important.  You know how to 
read and write? ﬂ  That™s what 
it is.  And one time, I was– th
ey picked me  on a case about 
weights and measures, and– and I told them– so, 
we ma de– they settled 
it out of court.  And 
they said, ﬁYou could go home .ﬂ  I asked the judge
, I was there a whole week.  ﬁThe money that 
we™re going to get, do we  have to declare it?ﬂ  
And he turned around and he said to me, ﬁLet 
your conscience be the guidance.ﬂ  (Laughing.)  A
nd I™m still laughing about it.  Whatever they 
give you.  I don™t reme mber exactly, seven or eight 
dollars a day.  But the way he answered it.  I 
said, ﬁDo I have to declare it?ﬂ  Like afraid 
to be good.  You know what I am saying?   To do 
what is the right thing to do.  That was always 
me– I was always.  And I asked him.  He said, 
ﬁLet your conscience be the guide.ﬂ
  I said thank you, and I went on. 
 
Q: So, did you report it or not? 

 

A: No, I did not, had no conscience.  I think it was ab
out sixty or seventy doll
ars I ma de that week.  
Don™t forget I had to take off transportation, 
too.  (Laughing.)  But it was very funny.  I thought 
it was very funny. 
 

Q: Did you ma ke friends with pe
ople who were American Jews– 
 

A: Rightaway. 

 

Q:  –outside the survivor community? 

 
A: Oh yeah, right away.  My husband introduced me  to
 his friend that he came the same  time  like he 
did to the United States.  And his wife was an 
American girl.  And now s he™s, poor thing, in a 
home .  She has Alzheime r™s.  And we were the be
st of friends, all our,
 through our life.  We  
always said we™re going to help each other 
when we™re going get– she had no mother.  Her 
mother passed away.  Her father had rema rrie d, and she had a hard life, and she had two boys 
and the sons write to me and th
ey call me all the ti
me.  And we became like family right away, 
and helping one another.  If I didn™t have no child
ren yet, she wanted to go some place, I babysat.  
We always, always helping ways.  If I ma de some th
ing and I knew that the 
kids are going to like, 
I used to bring over some food, and they enjoyed it.
  Things like European things, but they loved 
it, certain things that 
she didn™t know how to ma
ke.  And I had a lot of friends, American born, 
here, but they were people, they were– I never 
had a problem.  Never.  They were them and I 
was me , that™s it.  Maybe because
 they considered themselves an American and had friends.  So 

ma ybe that™s what it was, but I 
never, never found any fault. 
 

Q: When you think back over the eras, the years af
ter the war that you spentin the United States, 
and you think about the 1950s and the 1960s and 
the 1970s and some  of the move me nt s, the 
social move me nts and political moveme nts that 
were happening at that 
time , was there anything 
that touched you directly?   Li ke 
the Civil Rights move me nt for ex
ample, or the McCarthy era or 
the wome n™ s move me nt.  We re any of those intere
sting to you or did th
ey affect you personally 
in any way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003

49
 
A: The only thing that I cannot watch here and I 
cannot agree with them is like, no love for your 
brother.  The guns, the killing, th
e stealing, the–  all these things
 goes against me.  There is no 
reason for it.  There is no reason for it.  Or
 you see some body r obbing in the street.  There™s no– 
it doesn™t call for it.  You could work and ma ke
 a living.  And I™m very
 much against these 
things.  I feel that everybody is the same , has th
e same  right.  I have a woma n that takes care on 
me from the day I got here.  And now it™s almos t  tw
o years, it™s going to be
 in June.  I treat her 
royally, better than I treat myself.  She has a ch
ip on her shoulder because she is black.  And I 
keep telling her.  Like she gets
 excited if some body looks wrong at 
her.  I says, ﬁTeresa, grow 
up, it™s all in your head.  It™s 
no place else but in your head.  I don™t know why you have that 
feeling in you.ﬂ  She was persecu
ted and this and that.  I said, 
ﬁI was not sitting on my beautiful 
chair and watching television all my life, too.  
I was very hurt in my– but you got to let go, you 
can™t hold on to these things.ﬂ  
I don™t agree with a lot 
of things.  I personally
 think they have it 
too God damn good, they should go out to work bette
r.  Even those kids, what went on now.  It™s 
a terrible thing that doesn
™t call for all thes
e things.  And how did the pa
rents not know about it?  
I will never believe it. 
 

Q: You talking about th
e shooting in Colorado? 
 

A: I think it™s a disgrace.  It™s a disgrace.

Q: Continuation of an interview with Justine Lerner. 
 This is tape number four, side A.  Okay, were 
you finished? 
 
A: About Bosnia we were talking.  Yeah, the way 
they™re throwing them out of their homes.  It 
brought back so ma ny me mories. 
 

Q: AndKosovo. 

 

A: And Kosovo, yeah.  I was sit
ting and crying.  My son called me, 
said, ﬁWhat™s the matter, Ma?ﬂ  
I said, ﬁThat™s what it is.  I can™t take these th
ings.  It doesn™t call for 
all these things.  It™s 
enough is enough.ﬂ  But I guess it™s not enough yet. 
 

Q: Did you ever go back and visit Poland? 

 

A: No, I would never go back there, ne ve r, never in 
a million years.  I went to Israel .  We  travel ed a 
lot.  And we went to South America.  We  we
nt a lot of places, but I would never go back to 
Poland.  I feel that I have nothing there but mi ser
y.  I have no graves.  I have nothing to go to, 
even to go on the grave, I don™t.  To say hello, 
I don™t have no graves.  
I have nothing, so what 
am I going to go see?   Never.  Never, never.
  My husband did go, to see my house where we 
lived.  Oh yeah, but I would never do that.  He 
went without me.  We went to Washington that 
time and he went to Poland.   
 

Q: He went to Poland to see the house? 

 
A: Uh huh.  He  went on a– on a tour.  And I woul
d never in a million and one years go.  I have 
no– I have no heart for this anymore.  I cannot ma ke
 it any better, so.  I want to remember it the 
way it was.   
 
Q: You moved to Kentucky after 
that very horrible event happened 
to you.  And I imagine that after 
what you had already been through in your
 life– how did you recover emotionally, 

psychologically?   I mean, to experience such a tr
agic, trauma tic event again.  We re you able to 
recover your hope and your faith in the good of hu
ma nity after that?   
Did you feel like it all 
turned your sense of hope–? 
 

A: It™s a very funny thing.  I still 
have my beliefs and I cannot change
 it.  It™s– I take him for a bad 
boy.  The child was on dope.  That™s what the mo ther says.  I don™t know.  I didn™t know hi m and 

I wish I would have never known him.  I™m not ther
e to fight the case.  He only got six and a half 
years, which is nothing. 
 

Q: It was one person who had attacked you? 

 

A: One person that did that.  He 
robbed me .  I f he would come  in 
and would rob me , he would want 
my jewelry, I would give it to hi m gladly.  He di
dn™t have to kill me .  But– and if you ask me ,

do I reme mb er him?   No.  The detectives came wh
en I was in the hospital, I reme mber, the day I 
left.  Showed me  pictures of hi m. 
 Never saw him before in my life. 
 
Q: How did they catch hi m?  

 

A: The kids from the area gave him out.  The po
lice went around, detectives
 searching what went 
on, you know, looking.  And they were the ones that 
gave him the address and the name .  And he  
did two people the same  day, me  and another woma n a block away.  So, I me an– and it was not 

a black boy.  It was a white boy.  So the mother is 
there.  I should say that I feel sorry for the 
mother?   No.  That this would be a lie.  She goe
s every day to court when it went on the case.  I 

was not there.  My son was not there.  So we ha
d a lawyer, but they coul
dn™t fight it without us.  
He left me a crippl e for the rest of my life a
nd all the pain that I have with me , but nothing 
helped.  Because he was there, a
nd that™s what he got, six and a ha
lf years.  He™ll come  out, he™ll 
do it again.  But I can do nothing about it.  Canno
t take a gun and go and kill hi m, because it™s 
against me .  I can™t do that.  But that™s it.  But 
on the other hand I have to 
take that thing out of 
my life.  I could lay down and die?   No.  My ti
me wasn™t up yet.  When my time is going to be 
up, I™ll go.  But I have another extens
ion of life, so I have to go a
nd enjoy it.  And that™s the way 
I™m doing it.  I™m enjoying it– I™m not enjoying it, 
but I™m alive.  Let™s put it this way.  Like for 
the holidays, my son belongs to a– the Reform 
t e mple, so I went with him.  And the four 
doctors that used to take care on me  in the hospi
tal were there and they 
came  over to wish me  a 
happy New Year.  And they couldn™t get over how good you look.  I said, ﬁThank God for the 

ma ke-up.ﬂ  I always have some thing what to sa
y.  I said, ﬁThank God for the ma ke-up, it covers 
all the sins.ﬂ  I says, ﬁThat™s nice.ﬂ  He sai
d, ﬁA lot of people™s ma ke-up cannot do such a good 
job like this.ﬂ  (Laughing.)  But I always have so
me thing I could always ma ke a joke out of it.  
You know what I™m sayi
ng?   But that™s it. 
 
Q: Will you say your son™s name for th
e record and something about him? 
 
A: Would I say some thing for my son?  

 

Q: Just about your son and his name? 

 

A: I was always a good mo ther.  I have to– I ha
ve to compli me nt myself.  I was always a good 
mother, looking out for the child.  Always being ther
e for him.  And I think that™s what he repays 
me  back.  He™s there for me  all the time .  He cares about me .  But I understand very much he has 

his own life and I don™t want to take nothing away
 from hi m.  But he™s a very good boy. He™s 
good.  And I™m thankful to God that I have him.  
And that™s what it™s al
l about.  He takes care on 
me .  I was good to him, too.   
 

Q: His name  is Joel? 

 

A: Joel Lerner.   

 

Q: And your grandchildren, you have how ma ny?  

 

A: I have four grandkids.

Q: What are their name s? 

 

A: The oldest one is Shawn.  Which he was just, in
 February fourteenth, he
 was twenty-two.  He™s 
in school, college, rather.  My s
econd one is Lindsay.  Lindsay is
 twenty.  She was twenty, in 
March twenty-seven, she was twenty.  And she too 
is in college.  The number three is Daniel.  
He™s still in high school.  Daniel
 was sixteen, he™s going to be 
seventeen.  And my youngest one 
is thirteen, Ashley.   
 

Q: And they™ve taken, at least Daniel has 
taken a special intere
st in your history. 
 

A: They all do, I would say.  I 
would say they all do.  Now, th
e youngest one now, wants to go to 
Israel later on, I guess, when she™s going to be si
xteen.  I said, ﬁI™ll help you every way I can.  I 
want you to see your land.  And I want you, too, li
ke the others did.ﬂ  Ashley went, uh Lindsay 
went, so did Shawn.  Da niel™s 
going to go along maybe later on a li
ttle bit.  And I always visit 
them, because I lived in Brooklyn and they know I 
have the love for them and they have their 
love for me .  I know they are ve
ry busy.  I would like to see th
em more often.  But I understand 
that not only do they have  their life, but I can™t dema nd anything from them, because I™m not 

going to get it.  I should be tha
nkful whatever I got and that™s th
e way I go on.  They respect me  
and I respect them and that™s what it is.  A lot 
of people cannot see it, the wa y I see it.  I cannot 
dema nd from anybody.  I™ll do myself.  But my frie
nd just lost her husba
nd not long ago and he 
used to be, he used to take her all over and he
lp her with every way.  And she couldn™t walk two 
blocks.  Now of course, she finds it very, very 
hard.  She has one daught
er and the daughter is 
getting tired of it alrea
dy.  She has a family too and she work
s.  I said, ﬁBetty, get a hold of 
yourself.  She has her life too.  You can™t demand 
too much, because you™re not going to get it.  
That™s it.  It™s nobody™s fault that, you know, you got 
spoiled all your life.  
And that™s what it™s 
all about.  That™s it.  You, you can work.  Y
ou can™t go, walk?  Get a cab, go whatever you have 
to do.  There™s no alternative.  
If you don™t drive that™s what you 
have to do.ﬂ  And I cannot lay 
on anybody– I™m always appreciative whatever
 you do, it™s good, it™s okay.  I ma y think 
differently, but I™m not going to give it out.  I ca
n™t do that.  I still know 
between right and wrong 
and I™m a happy bird.  I™m very happy, all my life, like a stupid– [laughing]  I™m a ha ppy-go-

lucky. 
 

Q: You ca me  to Kentucky after your attack, you were
 attacked in New York
.  And that was 1997?   
Is that right? 
 

A: Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Yeah, it™s go
ing to be two years in June. 
 

Q: What were your ideas and e
xpectations of Kentucky and what
 were your first impressions? 
 

A: I had no expectations.  I didn™
t know at that point what was goi
ng on in my  life.  I– my husband 
never wanted to move to Kentucky.  He didn™t lik
e Kentucky.  It was not for him.  But being the 
neighborhood started to change, so I 
started to talk to him about it. 
 He didn™t want
 to listen to 
me .  ﬁThat™s my home  a nd that™s the way I™m go
ing to be there.ﬂ  So, I didn™t have too much 
expectations.  I knew what was going on in Kent
ucky.  The money talks.  He found out, he felt 
like that– if you want to meet some body, you 
go out for lunch.  My husband was from a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
53
 
 
53
different era, he knew his wife is going to ma ke lunch and you come  to the house.  And I found it 
very hard, too with that thing.  Because theydon™t want to cook, everything is going out and he 

was not used to a life like this.   
 

Q: You mean in Kentucky–? 

 

A: In Kentucky, in Kentucky, yes, yes, yes.  
So, he was not too much 
for Ke ntucky, but after he 
passed away, I didn™t know what to do.  I knew I 
couldn™t stay too long where I was, because the 
neighborhood was changing.  A lot of
 my friends moved away.  So, where did they go?   Either 
they went to Florida or they went to New Jers
ey.  And I figured I™ll find out.  So I went to 
Florida for the winter for four months, and I– 
I still was undecided what 
to do.  And then this 
thing came up and– and here 
I am.  And that™s right. 
 

Q: What were your first impressions of Ke
ntucky?  You moved to
 Louisville, right? 
 

A: Yeah.  What was my i mpression?  I mean, 
I knew I™ll never make a friend over here, because 
that™s my age.  You ma ke friends when you™re
 young and you hold onto them.  When you are an 
older person, I don™t want to hear their problems 
and they don™t want to hear my problems.  You 
talk about sicknesses.  Especially
 if I don™t drive, that
™s a disability alread
y.  I cannot– I have to 
wait for somebody to take me .  And I don™t like that
.  I was always used to walk and do my own 
thing.  And solve my own problems.  I was a pr
ivate person.  I didn™t li
ke anybody to feel sorry 
for me  or whatever.  So– but here I have no alte
rnative.  I have a woma n that helps me.  She 
takes me  all over, wherever I have to go.  She 
ma kes the appointments fo
r me with my doctors 
and that™s it.  I do my own cooking, and 
that™s it.  It™s a lonely life.   
 

Q: Did you ma ke any connections with the Je wish community, the Holocaust survivors? 
 
A: I never went to the Holocaust– I didn™t even 
know that they had one 
over here.  I would like 
you to, if you have an address, to 
leave it and I™ll find out mo re a
bout it.  This I would like very 
much.  I didn™t even know that they have 
a Holocaust– the Jewish, JCC,  the Jewish– 
 

Q: CommunityCenter? 

 

A: –Communi ty Center.  I went after my hus
band passed away, and I came down for a holiday 
over here by myself.  And my
 son took me  around to show me I should settle over here in 
Louisville.  So we ma de  an appointme nt with 
the JCC that I should go over there, you know, and 

they™ll tell me  what I could do, what, what kind of facilities they have for senior  citizens and all 

that thing.  So, he dropped me  of f at ten o™clock in the morning. 
 This was before I got hurt, 

before my a ccident.  He dropped me  off at ten 
o™clock in the morning and she showed me  the 
building.  She showed me  all the things what they
 have for senior citizens.  And he says, ﬁMa, 
you™re going to have lunch over here and I™ll pick
 you up after lunch.ﬂ  I says, fine.  So, the lady 
takes me  for a walk and shows me  the building. 
 And then she showed me downstairs where all 
the senior citizens meet.  And they were ma king a journal, because a 
journal come s out like 
every month.  And I was helping them to put th
e journal together.  A
nd I was very happy.  And 
of course, I was the youngest one, you could imag
ine.  (Laughing.)  One didn™t hear, one didn™t 
see, but I took everything fine, it™s good.  And 
I had my poc ketbook with me , and I said to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003
  
 
54
 
 
54
woma n that I was working with, I said, where 
could I, where do you leav
e your bags?   Where do 
you put your pocketbook?   She says, ﬁPut it next to 
me  on my – at the table.  I™ll sit over here 
and you™ll sit next to me. We™ll ha
ve lunch together.ﬂ  I says, fi
ne, thank you.  And it must have 
been ma ybe about ten to twelve.  And the lady 
come s over, ﬁWhose bag is that?  I said, ﬁIt™s 
mi ne.  What™s the ma tter? ﬂ  ﬁThat™s my seat.ﬂ  
I said, ﬁI™m s orry.  I™ll 
take it away.  I didn™t 
know.  The other one told me , that lady told me  
I could sit over here, no big deal.ﬂ  And it threw 
me  off so much, that I just– I wasn™t used to it.
  I said, ﬁAh, that™s not 
for me .  Let them stay 
with them.  I™m not going to come  back.ﬂ  And sin
ce then, I went again.  I 
went to a concert there 
not long ago.  I try, but some how, I don™t get– it™s not for me.  I can™t 
be like that, them– it™s 
like anything else, I don™t know them.  Let™s put it 
this way.  And to get ac
quainted at this point 
and to have their lunches, whic
h I don™t care for, it brings ba
ck too many me mories.  So, I™d 
rather stay home .  And here they have a pool and 
ma ybe I™ll join the pool.  I™ll go over.  I™ll take 
a look.  And that™s it. 
 
Q: Are you a member of a s ynagogue, 
a temple here in Louisville? 
 

A: Yeah.  Yeah, I belong to the Reform a
nd to the Conservative, to both of them. 
 

Q: Do you go to services? 

 

A: Oh sure I go, holidays, not every Saturday.  Holidays I do go.   

 

Q: So, are mostly the people that you spend tim
e with are Teresa, who™s your caregiver and the 
me mbers of your fa mily? 
 

A: Right.  Right.  We ll, I made friends with a la
dy over here.  She™s not Jewish, she™s gentile, but 
we have a lot in common and we™re very good– 
so I go with her some times to a movie.  
Teresa™s off, Saturday she works a few hours and S
undays she™s off.  So that™s the days, she took 
me , that lady, to her daughter™s.  They had the 
Derby party.  So, I brought a bottle of wine.  I 
went there, and they were very, very hospitabl
e, very, very nice.  I had a good time.  But 
otherwise, I stick to my famil
y.  And of course, my friends in
 New York.  I talk to them.  
Saturday and Sunday, I™m busy with
 the telephone.  I mean duringthe week, too, but– I keep in 

touch.   
 

Q: Is there anything else you™d like 
to add?   Any concluding thoughts? 
 

A: Includingwhat? 

 

Q: Concludingthought
s?   (Laughter.) 
 

A: Concludingfoxes?
