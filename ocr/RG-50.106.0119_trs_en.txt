Kittlitztreben 
to 
Buchenwa ld
. We 
were there for about a week and then I Œ 
I went out with the 
last transport from

Buchen wald
. I was hiding in th e wall and sudden I heard shooting in to the wall 
cause some  other people came. I went out 
through a window, cut myself, and ran in 
Œ outside I shouldn™t get shot and they we
re already a line Œ lined up, only Jewish 
people. They only asked for Jewi
sh people. And we walked to 
Weimar
 by fo ot, 
which it was full glass, probably a half 
a foot glass from bombing and ev erything. 
And then on cattle train, put us about h
undred or 110, I don™t know exactly, on the 
train. And people were dying ev ery day, 
no food, no water, anything. And we threw 
out bodies. But we didn™t ha
ve place where to sit or anything. Wh en it got mo re 
roomy and more place, actually took so me 
bodies to make ourselves pillows, and 
we sat on them. And on the fourth day they  
stopped at the station, which they  gave 
us a soup. And it was pure salt, this proba
bly meant to kill us off, which I threw 
away right away 
[indecipherable]
 the other people don™t eat it. And on the fifth day 
they gave us some potatoes, they stopped 
at the station. And th en came two Russian 
airplanes, and th ey started strafing the lo
comotive. Every five minutes the two came 
back. They were there for 
about a minute, strafing them. And on each side of the 
track were German soldiers also, and th
e aircraft, and other transports from the 
other camp. At that time when I ran down 
the train, from the train everybody ran, 
because we were afraid of 
the bullets from strafing. From
 another train came a boy 
from my  city. He was a young Œ a young kid 
ab out 15 years old, and he was a Pole

in the camp, not as a Jewish guy. Says, co
me on, we™ll be with the Polish people, 
not as Jews, and you will survive better a
nd we go there, and we have more food 
there than you do. And I says no, I will 
[indecipherable]
 with the Jewish people, I 
am going to stay, you can join me. And 
we were there a whole night long in  the 
field laying around an d the bom
bs were falling we saw from 
[indecipherable]
 
everything red, on fire, with heav y bombing from the 
[indecipherable]
. And this is 
the last time I saw that boy, he went ba
ck. In fact, I think 
they killed the whole 
transport there, and he got k
illed too, he didn™t survive.
 They Œ several of us got 
away, but they killed 
them, because even so
ldiers, not only the 
SS
, they were 
looking for us, and we walked
 all the way til we came to 
Terezin. 
In 
Terezin
 we 
were very hungry , dirty, and I don™t have to tell you the lice and everything, they  
ate us up alive. And we waited at 
Terezin
 all night long, they didn™t have a place 
for us. We slept on the stones there, I re
member. Then we came 
the morning, they 
gave us hot coffee, bread, and some cheese
. And right away they  Œ we had to  give 
away our clothing. We were washed and ev
erything. They gave me two new shirts, 
clean white shirts. This is 
the first time I put on a shir
t in four years. And nice 
clothing, and even a pajama, I wa
s shocked. And we were in the 
Hamburg 
caserna
(p h).
 
We were there for a couple days, 
and people were just dying in  the 
room, sick from typhus. And I was very sc
ared to be with them. I knew Œ I saw

what™s happening. And I jump ed down  a wind
ow, I don™t know if I was sick at that 
time or so mething, but something, I jump
ed out the window and I don™t know how 
long I was on the feet. But 
in th e mo rning I Œ I have, in sleep like singing Czech 
songs, partisan songs, and 
when  I woke up there was a Russian soldier what woke 
me up. He stood with me. And they gave me  some food. I went back  to the Œ went 
back to th e room there with some other people, we only left 16 people from over 30. 

And then  I went out, I couldn™t walk b
ecause I was only abou
t around 80 pounds, 
not any more. And after a day, the entire 
long day, a guy from our barrack, he was 
very hefty, he mu st be the kapo
 
or something, but a h
ealthy guy, he smuggled 
himself out from 
Terezin
, because it was quarantine, th ey didn™t let anybody out, 
there were Czech soldiers staying outside the 
[indecipherable]
 because a lot of 
sickness was going, typhus. Th-Thousands of 
people died at that time. And he came 
with the wagon, horse and 
wagon and on th e wag
on he had wine, cases and cases of 
wine. And the Portuguese sardines in gol
den labels, I rememb er like now. And he 
brought in there thousands and thousands 
of hundred mark bills, which we didn™t 
have toilet tissue, was diarrhea a lot, and 
we put them on a hook, on nails, and we 
put them in Œ we didn™t know that the m
oney will ever be good
 for something, how 
would we know? We didn™t ha
ve any other paper. And all 
I ate is the sardines and 
the Œ and the wine drank. And 
we didn™t have bread or anything. And th en they  told 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

me to go to the doctor. When I went to th
e doctor and he says, 
what have you been 
eating, that you not even  hu
ngry? First of all, my  stomach shrank, we couldn™t eat 
mu ch. And he says, you™re pretty lucky,
 because you could have died from the 
sardines. You are lucky that you drank a lot 
of wine. The wine, that saved your life. 
And they  gave us food, right away  theybrought in fo od, the same food wh at the 
army, the Soviet army took. And this was 
the biggest, biggest mistake, because th-
they came in with the field kitchen, and th
ey have kraut with bacon in it, meat, an d 
potatoes and everything so fat, and people 
were dying like flies from the food. Then  
I heard when you were liberat
ed by the Americans, they
 didn™t give you no fo od, 
very little, because the stomach
 shrank, you couldn™t eat anything. And that™s the 
reason a lot of people they could surviv
e, died from the food. And I was very 
careful. When he told  me you lucky th at the wine Œ and when  they  gave such  a 

food, all I ate was a little piece meat, not 
much, and the potatoes. And a liquid. They 
gave milk, this I drank, and Œ fo r abou
t a week. And then th
 Œ th-they burned 
[indecipherable]
 there because they were fu
ll with, you know, vermin and 
everything. And dead  people 
were all around. And then Œ 
Q: Did th e docto r explain to 
you why sardines were dange
rous and woul
d have been 
harmful to you?

A: No, he didn™t explain, he just said that
 you were lucky, but 
they tasted so good. 
Yeah, and everybody ate them, 
and we drank a lot of wine
. We didn™t have anything 
to do, cause we were afraid to go to othe
r barracks there. They weren™t barracks, but 
the other buildings, cause this was actually
 the ghetto, it wasn™t barracks. And we 
afraid a lot Œ I met there so
me friends, they were sick
, from my hometown also. 
And a lot of my friends passed away. And we saw there Œ there I met a girl fro m 
Yugoslavia
, she was on a bench sitting, I warmed 
myself in the sun,
 and then I met 
the girl
 Truwik
(ph)
 
from our city, from 
Dabrowa,
 they have a store with leather 
goods, the ver Œ very  fine family and we 
talked about it. And then came the Œ they 
came for her that she went to 
Sweden
. She begged me to go with her to 
Sweden
. 
And Œ cause they took young 
kids there. And I says no,
 I™m gonna wait, maybe I 
find somebody or something. And I saw 
there guard s, huge guards, they took 
Germans, the
 SS
 and other people, cleaning away 
the dirts and everything, and we 
screamed at them, we 
[indecipherable]
 but we couldn™t do any other thing, and I 
was sorry I didn™t kill a couple of them. But there™s not
hing you c
ould do. 
Q: When  were you liberated? 

A: Well, let me tell you the story what was.
 From the Red Cross they came, ask my  
name, from which city I am, and the inform
ation that they  took from me, went the 
same, I think, on the radio in 
New York.
 All over 
Europe
, every night betw een 10

and one in  the mo rning, they Œ they  
called out names who surviv e, which camp 
were they at, so on, so on.
 So my sister™s husband, 
Klugman,
 the one that was the 
secretary from 
[indecipherable]
 he heard on the radio I am alive. He was in 
Budapest
 at that time. He was with his son, 
he was in the underground, and Œ so 
when  they  heard me, he went alone, his s
on, they made up that they™re gonna meet 
in 
Prague
, and he came to 
Terezi n
. Of course, they wouldn™t 
let nobody out at that 
time, but he had his son™s pass, and with th
is pass they let me out, and he was as a 
correspondent, because he had papers as a 
co rrespondent there. 
And he took me out 
from there, I had only  one pair of pants, 
I took along an other shirt what they gave 
me, and we walked a couple miles to 
Buchewice
(ph) because there was no train at 
that time. 
Q: When  were you liberated? You know the date? 

A: I was Œ I was liberated, was around the si
xth or seventh of Œ of May, or maybe 
earlier, I will never know the date exact, but
 appro Œ approximately this is the time. 
Cause don™t forget, I was out, I do
n™t know how long I was out.  
Q: You said that they announced  on th e radio your name Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in the camps. What camps
 were you in  during th e war?

A: Well, I was Œ first of all, of course 
in the ghetto. Then I wa
s in one camp right 
after they took my pa
rents away, the Jewish community send me to 
Szczakowa. 
This was a leather factory, which we work
, we were about 30 men there. And after 
it was 
Judenrein
 in all 
Upper Silesia
 and we got food from the Jewish community. 
The 
Juden [indecipherable] 
send us food. And when  was no mo re food, about two 
weeks after
 Judenrein
, the
 SS
 came. Now, the 
SS 
came, they took us away from 
Szczakowa
 and we were the ones cleaning out the 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Sosn owiec
, 
Chancer
(ph) was still there, he was the 
Juden-Elster
(ph) from 
[indecipherable]
. 
And we went there, I remember all the 
sto Œ all with people were sleeping and 
everything. And one mo rning before 
[indecipherable]
 we came Œ we went to work, 
came the 
SS
 man
 Ludwig .
 He was the head that they  sent all the people to th e 
camps from 
Silesia
 and ev erybody was petrified s
cared of him because we knew 
who he was. He sent my sister to t h e ca
mp  also, and everybody from our city. And 
he ask if there is a painter. And I was doi
ng painting in the ghett
o during the war for 
the 
Bauleitung.
 This is the building company that
 they send us to work . I was doing 
bricklayin g and painting a lot and I learne
d the trade very good in the war, I was 
very good, young, and I kept my  mouth 
shut, because I was afraid. I was a young 
boy, short, and I™m not going to  tell him I™
m a mechanic, I™m a painter, I was afraid 
of him. So one from my  
city that was with me 
[indecipherable]
 his name, said that

the 
Rosen
 is a painter. So he came Œ he came over to me, 
bist du ein Maler? 
Jawohl Oberscharfuehrer,
 he gave me right away in the face 
[indecipherable]
 he 
knocks me out, all the teeth. 
[speaks German here]
. Why do you keep your mouth 
shut? I am a painter, I said, 
I am a very good painter, ve
ry  good. He puts me on the 
side. I didn™t know what he was going to 
do with me. Everybody 
went to work and I 
stood there for about a ha
lf hour. Then came two
 SS
 men with him. He said, I got 
three rooms to paint and I give you th ree days. And he took out his pistol, tapped 
me in my head. He said, if you are not fini
shed in three days, you
 lived enough. So I 
told him, I don™t have no tools, I don™t 
have no material. If you allow me to go to 
Dabrowa
 where we live, I got some tools th
at I work in the ghetto and I can 
[indecipherable]
. He says, you don™t need anythi
ng, you get everything. So  the Œ 
the two 
SS
 men took me, I walk
 with them through 
Sosn owiec
, this was in 
Sosnowiec
 and while you walking on 
the street, I noticed a Jewish girl. Blonde hair, 
beautiful girl, I knew her. And she passed by so
 fast, and Œ and I looked away that I 
didn™t want to pay attention wh ere that sh
e should get caught or something. Bu t she 
walked by. Then we went 
into a hardware store.  
Q: I have to just check th e equipment for one moment. 
A: Yeah. 
[tape break] 
Q: Okay, we™re back, I™m sorry. 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

A: Okay, after Œ 
Q: You were telling me about the Œ 

A: Œ after I worked by Œ 
Q: Œ I asked you about the camp s. 
A: Yeah, after I worked by him, and I wa
s working there for ab
out four weeks, so 
he said, well, 
Maler,
 you are not going to  
Auschwitz
, which I didn™t know what 
Auschwitz
 meant at all. At that time we didn™t
 know. And he said, but I send you to  
a camp. And he brought me food every day. 
So I ask him, is it possible you send me 
to a camp where my  sister is, I don™t have 
nobody from my  family
, just a sister. He 
says, where is she? 
I said, she is in 
Gruenberg,
 Lower 
Silesia. 
He says well, this is 
a women™s camp. And then he stood fo r a second 
[indecipherable]
 that you will go 
there. But meanwhile you go to  another 
camp, a transition, which I went to 

Annaburg
, and this was around October we went to
 Anna burg . 
There was no 
work there, but the transiti
on beating every day. And fro
m there I was sent Œ only 
three people went, 
Chancer
(ph), which was the 
Juden-Elster 
from Œ from 
Dula c
(ph) and 
Sosnowiec
, and 
Herta
(ph) 
Goldfinger, 
which it was his sweetheart. 
She was Œ sh e went over to Christianity, 
but still she was Jewish. They send her and 
she became 
Juden
-
Eltesten
(ph)
 
for the women in the cam
p, and by my self. I came 
there, it was about October in ™43, and th
ere were already some people there, men

there, and I walked there in the 
[indecipherable]
 where they make 
[indecipherable]
 and the first 
[in d ecipherable]
 arrived, he let me in to see my 
sister,  the 
Juden
-
Elster
, because you got to go th r
ough the women™s barrack, the 
women™s hall and the men went with the 
[indecipherable]
 every day, and I went to 
see her every day and I saw my sister ev
ery day in camp. And there we were til 
about March 1944. The
 SS
 came for us because there was Œ the me n couldn™t be 
any more with the women, it became not a labor camp, forced labor camp, but a 
concen tration camp. And we were sent to 
Kittlitztreben.
 Was a subcamp from 
Gross-Rosen.
 It was hell there because the Œ th
e barracks were still not heated, no 
water, anything. And from there we were
 til February fifth.
 When the Russians 
came near, we marched out on foot and this
 was the first death march, of wh ich in 
previous tape I told my  story. And we arrived sometimes in April to 
Buchenwa ld. 
And
 Buchenwa ld
 was hell too, with all the dead
 people around everywhere and 
mountains of people, which I saw cannibalism 
for the first time. A
nd on the heap of 
the dead bodies were still some live 
people half dead, one of them was 
Meyer 
Hysharik
(ph). He was a German  Jew, but they 
chased him out. He was in our city 
and I used  to play 
[indecipherable]
 ping-pong with him in the 
Ma cca b ee 
quarters. 
And he asked me, don™t you recognize me? I am 
Meyer. 
He says I knew Œ but at 
that time w h en I saw the other people cuttin
g thing, and I start screaming at them. 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

So they ran to me and I ran away. And then
 we heard that the American army came 
close by and they start to taking out only
 Jewish people, they called for Jewish 
people first, which was, I was hiding in th e 
wall, I told the story. And then we went 
to 
Weimar
 by trains and th is was the second death march to 
Theresienstadt
. 
Theresienstadt
 I arrived toward the end of April, must be the 25
th
 or 26
th
. This is 
the date. And I was liberated in May,
 either the sixth or the seventh. 
Q: When you were liberated, tell me, what 
did you look like, and wh at was the state 
of your health? 

A: Well, the state of my health wasn™t ba
d, because all during 
Œ all during my  being 
in camp, I kept myself clean as can be. Th
is was the most important thing, not the 
food as much, but not 
to run after food to get beaten
 over a Œ a pea, on the death 
march, on a stomped cigarette like people go
t out and got beaten bloody, that™s how 
they died. I kept away fro
m this. I was with a couple
 people, friends from camp , 
from 
Gruenberg
. We kept ourselves clean, neat, we shaved, everything. And I 
would say I wasn™t very hungry, but I wasn™t
 sick, I didn™t have no diarrhea like all 
the other people. I was watching my self, 
I was sometimes with 
Œ two weeks without 
food. But the will to live an
d the will to live is on the death march because I have 
the pictures from my home. That™s what kept
 me alive. Of tor Œ course I lost them 
the last day in 
Buchenwald
. And what I wanted to liv
e is, I wanted to see, 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

16
particularly some of my friends, and 
especially wh en I met a young girl in 
Sosnowiec
, and I was hoping I can meet her. That
™s was the will to 
live, to see my 
family and this, and that™s what kept me 
aliv e. And I wasn 't 
thinking about fo od 
never, but just to take 
[indecipherable]
 I wanted to live. And that™s, I think, that I 
lived thro ugh th e war. And then , as I told you, my  sister™s husband came and took 

me out, and this was sometimes in May ar
ound, I would say around the 14 or the 
15
th
 of May. And we walked thro ugh 
[indecipherable]
 there was a train didn™t go 
this way, so we went the first time Œ da
y in  hotel. And we had there a dinner. Of 

course, they  didn™t have meat, but nice potat
oes with the soup, an d this is the first 

time that I ate like a person, with a tabl
ecloth and with a real fork and s Œ and 
spoon. The first time that I 
cried, and I says it couldn't 
happen. And when  I came to 
the room, the bed was all white linens, 
I couldn™t believe. And I took a shower 
there, went to bed. And the next mo rn
ing we got up early, an
d we waited for the 
train. On the train was no place, so we wa
lked up on the roof
 from the train, my 
brother-in-law, myself. We held onto each 
other, a lot of people were there. We 
came to 
Prague. 
We came to 
Prague
, the first thing when we got off the train, we 
saw on the street in every co
rner was the kiosk with food
, because a lot of people, a 
lot of people came out from the camp s hungry. So  every corner was a heart, a red 

heart and the ches Œ

food. So  we had soups, and they  gave 
us meat. They were so nice, that™s 
unbelievable. I Œ I just c
ouldn™t Œ couldn™t think th at anybody would be so nice, 
especially to Jewish people,

 after Œ after being there 
about two days in the hotel,

the hotel to sleep. And they were 
offniks

down , they grab me by the thing, and in
 Po lish, rough language, where do you think 
you go? You stay right here. But I Œ they
 threw my shirt, 
I jumped down, my 
brother-in-law jump ed down , right? Cause they
 were awful. They 
Œ th ey didn™t have 
men for a long time, this was their desire. 
And at that time I didn™t think of women. 
So I jumped down and went 
to the bathroom to wash up,
 and in th e bathroom comes 
a young Œ a young gentleman, 
was about 18 years and I th
ink Œ he ask me if I can 
loan the cup he wants to wash his teeth.

meet up. What happened, they gave me m
oney, they gave me ticket from the Czech 
people. I come to the trai n, the train arrive from

 people, 
nobody™s safe. So I turn back and went 
to saw my  brother. He says, I had enough, 
he says, I don™t like the Russians. They  ar

liberated us. He says, I don™t like the commu

the American guards or some
thing,don™t tell them you

. So my nephew started 
talking to him English, in a perfect Englis
h and th e same thing my  brother. So they 
ask how do you know such a good English? 
In fact, they used 
to have a French 
maid at home that she spoke to them only 
French and English in
stead of Po lish, and 
he knew very well. So
 they took them off 
from the train, who they  are, and he says 
you go, I find you. So
 I went by my self and arrived 
about 12 o™clock at night in 
Pilsner
. When I got out from the station there 
were American soldiers sleeping on 
the ground with their sleeping 
bags and blan kets. It was cold. A May day at night is 
very cold in
 Europe. 
And I was only dressed in a shirt 
and a pair of pants. So I lay 
down between them, kept pu
lling the blanket. They kept
 pulling back and I kept 
telling th Œ pull them to me. Finally I fellasleep, I don™t know, when I woke up it

angry at the Poles. 
And then  he tole Œ he gave me five

picture. About a week  later I get a telegram from 
Poland
, from a friend from my 
sister that they both escape togeth
er from the death march. Back to 
Gruenberg
 they 
went, to German people they
 went. And their life, well, 
that™s all I k n ew. This was 
the telegram which I still have it, and I™m
 going to give this to the museum. And 
when I heard my other sister is alive, 
so we packed ourself, went to Œ with a 
transport to 
Ulin
, to camp also a 
DP 
camp in
 Ulin
(ph).
 
And then  we smuggled 
ourself out from
 Ulin

UNRRA
 you know what they tell you wher
e to go, this Œ and we came to 
[indecipherable]

they were also invited ther
e. My friend from my city 
William Luxembourg, 
or 
Helen Luxembourg
 if you know. I know th em, th
ey were married there and we 
were good friends there. And I was there 
for awhile, then my 
other sister that 
escaped what I knew she™s alive. And what
 happened why we didn
™t see her before, 
when she ran away, she went 
with the Russian army to 
Russia
 to look for my older 
sister, she knew she escaped to
 Russia,
 looking fo r her 
[indecipherable]

she went back to 
Da nzig
 with her friend, and then
 she came Œ she came to 
Vidin
(ph) which I me t her too. And Œ 
Q: How did she know where to find you?
 How did you all know how to find each 
other? 
A: How Œ what happened Œ don
™t forget at that time, wh
erever you were in a camp, 
a 
DP
 camp, or you met a friend, leave 
a note that I am alive. And people 
[indecipherable]. 
For instance, the girl
, Karla
 
Lunda
(ph )  
[indecipherable]
 
Salzburg
, she got somebody in 
Poland
 let them know that I am in 
Salzburg
. That™s 
how I got the telegram. And my  older brother, he was in
 Prague
, he went in fact to 
pick up my youngest sister
, Bluma
 from
 Poland, 
how,
 
he didn™t have anything, you 
know how it was. And what I forgot to
 tell you, a very interesting story in  
Vo lary ,
 
which I go back. Very interesting. I didn™t 
have no shoes, I still walk around in my

wooden shoes. 
[indecipherable]
 So one of the officers, wh
ile I walk in the officers™ 
kitchen, he looked at me, he says, hop into  the 
Jeep
, come with me 
Moniek
. And Œ 
where we going? You will see. W e arrived in 
[indecipherable]

station. He knew that the Czech people th
rew out all the Germans, the same thing 
like they did to the Cz
echs, the Germans from
 
the 
Sudetenland
 threw out the 
Czechs, now they threw out th
e Germans, and they let them
 have 10 kilo in their 
bags, that™s all they were allowed to ta
ke. So  we saw there a lot of people with 
boots and everything. He goes over to one, a ex-German officer, ma ybe it was an
 
SS
 man, take off your boots. Put th em on
 Moniek
. About on the fifth person, they 
fit good. He took my  wooden shoes, gave 
th em. You took away  mo re from him. He 
wore this for many years, now you can w
ear them. Then he to
ok away the camera 
from him, with film. He says, you took 
away more from him than a camera. And 
with this camera I took pictures in the hosp
ital with the girls ther
e. I t o ok about 80 
pictures, I have so much film. And the histor
ical pictures from the girls laying in the 
hospital, the girls 
[indecipherable]
 which they Œ now you can see them in the 
mu seum, which I gave a whole book fr Œ ju st from
 Volary
 with my friends being in 
bed sick, they are now there, these historical pictures. That™s what I forgot to tell 
you. When we were in
 Salzburg
, I forgot to tell you, I went to see the girls when 
they went dancing th ere with their friend. And going to 
Barb ishel

have to go, and one to

there, we went in there to the men™s r
oom, it was outside, they didn™t have no, you 
know, in the stations. As I 
walk out from there, in come
 there, stood at the train  
comes a German policeman with
 me Œ with a invalid Œ a 
POW, 
a German 
POW 
on 
one foot. And he said, you took this man™s 
vallit
(ph), which is release papers, a 
POW
, money, everything. I says, are you crazy? Well, you ju st came out there from 
the toilet, and he was there. And he wanted
 to take out everything from pocket and 
my Œ my other friend were a 
big guy. He says, you are goi
ng to tell me what to do? 
Damn  Nazi, he called him, and he 
wouldn™t do it. So he called the 
MP
. The
 MP
, 
come with us. He took us in a 
Jeep
 to the constable, you know. I come in there, was 
a officer and a officer at the desk. Beautif
ul, tall guy, handsome as can be. Take out 
everything from the pockets. I took ou
t from the pockets. Why do you have 
American scrip? Are you on black market
? I says, I work for the American army 
and they  pay me with scrip and that™s wh
at I have. He took it away on the side. 
Then I have what an Am
erican soldier gave me
, a Jewish soldier in 
Vola ry
. This 
Yankee division, the 
Y. 
He took this away. And he sa
w pictures that I™m with the

be that I am with eight girls and I do th

that™s why I have so many co upons here. Didn™t believe me. They took us away to a 
prison. We come into the pr
ison on third floor, there ar
e Nazis there.
 Locked up. 
We started banging at the door, what it is. 
I says, we just came out from the Nazis 
and they put us like that. There we
re German guard s there, by the way 

[indecipherable]
. So they took us on the second
 floor, who was there? Prostitutes. 
Still better. Yeah, locked
 up. So, we had to sleep in 
the hall, they don™t have no 
other place, and we were there three days. Th
ey Œ I gave them the information that I 
am in 
Salzburg,
 in 
New P a lestine
, gave them there ev erything information. They 
took three days to find out who we are and if
 we are live there, if we tell the truth. 
Three days. After three days with th e 
Jeep
 they come and they 
took us back to  the Œ 
to the station. There was my  stuff he gi
ves me back, but the scrip and the Yankee 
division 
[indecipherable]
 and he give us for the trou
ble two carton cigarettes. I 
took the cigarettes, step ped them down and 
I spit in his face. I says, y ou damn Nazi, 
you put me with the doxies in camp . Well,
 what he™s going to do to  me? And I spit 
in his face. And Œ but this 
was far to go to the stati
on, wait, if so
mebody go. We 
don™t need  your help , you wo rse than the 
Nazis Œ because it™s after the war Œ and we 
walked out. What that incident

coming back from 
Barbishel

there. And there was a big stall where you 
stepped on it Œ you sit on it Œ to Œ you 
know Œ and I see some thing sticking out, a
nd it was his portfolio under the stall, he 
lost it. I threw it and I didn™t even look an
ything, I threw it into the toilet right away. 
But what™s interesting, that was the first high holidays, 
Rosh Hashonah
 in
 
Salzburg
. And they  Œ they
 took in the 
[indecipherable]
 where they have the 
[indecipherable]
 there for the American soldiers
, the Rainbow division what they 
called it. They had services for the high ho
lidays. So  displaced persons came for the 
high holidays for the first ti
me. I sit down there Œ I came with one of the girls, and 
sit down and I look at that beautiful dresse
d Œ that son-of-a-gun th at send me to the 
prison, to  the Nazis, that was behind the 
desk. And I looked up at him, you Nazi, 
you in th e synagogue? And I looked at hi
m, and I walk ed away and went all the 
way to th e back. He look at me, and I walk ed over again. You get out from the 

synagogue, you Nazi. He Œ he didn't answ
er anything. They weren™t nice. That™s 
that Œ that™s what hurts still today, that 
it hurts. And he didn™t kn
ow what to answer. 
He probab ly did his duties, but he shou
ld at Œ understand better, with Jewish 
prisoners wh ere he sent, and took three 
days to found. Well, anyway, I was in
 
Vidin
(ph). Then  Œ th en was transports th
ere and there came a gentleman by the 
name of 
Haskell

back because there was hope 
that they™re gonna go to 
Palestine
, evident, so we 
bought her new clothing, everything and sh e we
nt back  and in fact they went Œ they 
were the first ones, because from the 
Ex odus
 people had priority even  from
 
Cyprus,
 that they went first. And she met he

good friend of mine 
lived with me in 
Vidin
(ph), he was 
Shlamik
(ph) 
Merin
(ph) 
from 
Benzburg
(ph) 
[indecipherable]
 that when he went illegal to
 Palestine
 
through
 Marseilles, 
and he Œ he got off th
e ship, in the first 
[indecipherable]
 he 
didn™t even see anything of 
Israel
 that he got killed. They send him toward 
Jerusalem
, he didn™t even see his Œ anyt
hing. And I still 
have the death 
announcement from the paper, from the Jewish
 paper, I still have it at home. And so 
we supposed to go also to 
Israel, Palestine
. So my  brother said, look here, we lived 
through a war. We lost so much from 
our family. We have two aunts in 
New York, 
my father™s sister
s. If we go to 
Palestine,
 we can™t go to 
America
 later. If we in 
America
 we can all time go Œ time go to
 Israel. 
So we decided we are going to go 
wait out, and we got affidavits from my 
aunts, and with  the help from the
 HIAS
, we 
came to
 Bremen, 
it was October, this was two days before
 Rosh Hashonah
. W e  
came to
 New York
, and wh at happened , we have to 
get inoculation against all kind 
diseases, ev erything. And since I was a
ll the time fainting from the needle and 
everything, all in my  possession I have this 
50 dollar, that™s all what I have. I gave 
the nurse in 
Bremen
 the 50 dollar, please mark that 
everything is there, I was 
petrified for the needle. She took it, wrote 
everything down, I took all the needles, 
everything.

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ can you tell me for a few mo ments Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ what were the conditions like in the
 DP
 camp ? Tell me about life in the
 DP
 
camp. 
A: Life in the
 DP
 camps, it wasn™t bad. It depends where you were. For instance, 
New Palestine
. We were very close-knit from th
e camp. We Œ we knew each other, 
we went out dan Œ th at we 
had dances there, and pa Œ 
especially I went to Œ in 

Salzburg
, I went to every new show, any 
new operetta. What happened, you 
couldn™t get tickets there, they were very
 hard . Bu t, if you bribe the cashier, you 
have it. I bought her soap, I bough
t a stocking, wh ich I got from the 
UNRRA
. S o ap , 
I gave her. So from the soap
, other things, I got ticke
ts. Every time 
when  a new 
show came, I had several tickets, as many as
 I want. And at the Œ almost every day I 
went out somewhere, cause in 
camp, there was a lot to do 
[indecipherable]
 but I 
had to go out, I liked to 
go out and wh at I mi ssed out 
right during the war as a 
youngster, I want to catch up. And I met se
veral girls there, which of course one 
wanted to get married, 
but I said not in the 
DP
. And I wouldn™t do it, I Œ I not going 
to have a handout from the 
UNRRA
. This was a Hungarian girl from
 Budapest.
 
Very beautiful, intelligent gi
rl. Anyway, she went to 
Palestine, 
she oh Œ from the

ship she send me 
[indecipherable]
 even a letter, which I still have it, with the other 
things. But she went to 
Palestine, 
I came to United States. 
Q: What kinds of th
ings did th e survivors talk about in th e 
DP
 camps? 
A: Well, most of them about parents, ab
out what they  went thro ugh, ev erybody 
[indecipherable]
 through. And we had the paper ther
e that we gave out a lot, and a 
lot of people wrote articles also. And th  Œ 
we liked to make out for the lost time. 
That™s wh at™s about it. What I tried Œ wh
at I forgot to mention, right after the 
liberation, this was the wors
t time in my life, right after the liberation, cause during 
being in the camps, all what I thought is ho
w to  surviv e. Always
 I was thinking is 
only to surv ive, and we didn™t think anyt
hing about back home or anything. You 
didn™t have time to think. But after the lib
eration, then came 
back, where do I go? I 
don™t see my parents. This one™s missing,
 that one™s missing. Then I realize, I 
became again a person, with my mind and th
is was the worst time, and I was very, 
very nervous. And even
 when I came to the 
United States, 
for the first three y ears, 
all I did is taking pills and pills and pills
 til one doctor told me, you want to live? 
Put away the pills. You can
 do without them. Then I made up my mind and I 
stopped taking the pills, and I Œ and I startliving a normal life. But this was in the 
United States.
  
Q: I™m curious as to what kind s of pills. What kinds of pills? 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
41
A: I forgot. This was in the 50™s. What wa
s it for nerves, the p
ills that they gave? 
Q: Some kind of sedative? 
A: Sedative. But what got me that the docto
r even charged me for every pill. He had 
it as samples and he charged me
 10 cents for each pill.  
Q: When did you first co
me to realize the full 
extent of the genocide? 
A: Well, I knew in camp alr
eady what happened to my  parents. In camp, because a 
transport in ™44 came from 
Auschwitz
 to our camp, and it was a Œ and it was one 
from our city 
[indecipherable]
 
Lev enstein
(ph). And he says, oh your father™s alive 
because they have it good in 
Auschwitz
, because they were in 
[indecipherable]
 
and because they had a little 
bit more food, yeah. And fo
r him it was good, but the 
parents, they™re not alive, and he told 
me about the burning and ev erything and the 
extermination. So I knew already this, 
I knew everything. But we didn't know to  

what extent. I couldn™t believe at that tim
e to what extent, because here, okay, th ere 
were killings in the camp and everything, 
but we didn't  see, in our camp was no 
burn or ex termination, anything, it just that people died  from hunger and from 

beating. And I was very good at that. I ne
ver got the beating, only once, because I 
was short and I never stood in front in the 
lines, all the time the mid d le, and all ki Œ 
picked tall guys that they sh
ould be in front of me. Wh
en they hit I was all time

bend down and I n Œ I never got hit. I was 
selfish. But everybody looked to surv ive, 
that™s what it was. 
Q: Before you leave 
Europe
, is there anything else about the years after the war, 
while you were still in 
Europe
 that you would like to Œ to  cover, to talk about?  
Q: Well, about being in 
Europe
, I just hated 
Euro pe
, I wanted to get out from the 
bloody soil, es
pecially from 
Germany
. I wanted to get out, but we had to wait, we 
didn™t have where to go to
 Poland
. We couldn™t go back because a lot of killing 
was going 
Pola nd . 
And then it wa Œ I was too much hu
rting, going back to the city 
there, which I never wanted to go back. An
d then finally my time came, yes, w h at I 

wanted to know, right after th
e lib eration, when my friend 
Mo n i ek
 
Sheps
(ph) came 
to pick up his sister
, Sheva
(ph), which was in 
Va ramoltso
(ph), he told me that a 
good friend of ours, 
Moniek
 
Nifel
(ph), that he is in 
Bergen-Belsen
 very, very sick. 
So I left everything there and went by train, went to 
Bergen-Belsen
. I found him 
still alive. We talked, he cried, I am very
 sick. And of course this was under British 
occupation. Would he be under 
United Sta tes 
occupation, hundred percent he 

would be alive. Under the British, didn™t
 get medication, not the proper care, 
anything. And he expired there, unfortunatel
y. And a lot of people there, if they 
would be under the American
 occupation, they would do
 more. The British weren 't 
interested in anything to help out. That™s
 what I wanted to mention about it. And 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
43
they™re known for it. And then
 what was going on, we marched there, we protested 
a lot. I don™t know if you rememb er with 
Belvin
(ph), they didn™t let the Jewish 
people to 
Palestine
, we protested, and we wrote in. I wrote a letter also to the 
United Nations, 
which I still have copies of it. Not 
[indecipherable]
 but then the
 
Exodus
 ship and everything, I think that™s what helped
 Israel
 to beco me a nation. 
Q: Did you follow the 
Nuremberg
 trials while you were in
 Euro pe
? 
A: Yes, because my brother-in-law, my si
ster™s husband, he was a Jewish, the only 
Jewish correspondent from the 
DP
 camp s, in fact, and he covered all the 
Nuremberg
 trials. I w as there six  times because he
 took Œ he was able to take along 
as guests two people. And I gave one to th
e museum and I still have one of the entry 
cards. And I saw everybody there. The se
ssions, I even have the numbers of the 
sessions there. 
Nuremberg
 was everything demo lish except the building wh ere the 
tr Œ the international tribunal was there, wa
s standing. And in fact, I was Œ this year 
also there, I went back to the 
[indecipherable]
 cause I exhibited 
Nuremberg
 my  
exhibit this year, and I went to the courth
ouse there. I took even pictures how it 
looks now, I recognized the buildings
 right away wh en  I came there. 
Q: You said you saw everybody there.
 What do you mean you saw everybody 
there? Were you there for the main tria
l, or for the subsequent proceedings? 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
44
A: I went for the main trial. I saw  
Goering, Keitel
, everybody and when I saw on 
television the things I was looking if I can  see my  brother-in-law there, because he 
had good connections with 
Redenko
, wh ich it was the Russian prosecutor. And he 
tried to listen to the American prosecutor
 there, in fact, we had breakfast with 
Redenko
, which I am sorry I never took a pict
ure, he was very good friend with 
him, yes. And in  fact, my  brother-in-law 
was one of the first ones that wrote a book 

about 
[indecipherable]
 like sheep to the slaughter, in
 the 50™s. And he wrote a lot 
of articles in the Jewish papers
 and a lot of articles to the 
[indecipherable]
 that he 
covered the Œ the trials. But 
he never got any money or 
anything, he never ask for 
money or anything. Yes, and Œ and now 
we want to know about me coming to 
United States. 
Q: Yeah, one more question still in Œ in 
Europe
. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You said that you prot
ested wh en you were in 
Europe
. Can you tell me about 
the movement in the
 DP
 camps for the partition of 
Palestine
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What was going on, what was the politics of that.  
A: Well, the politics of that, that in every
 DP
 camps we scream
ed and we wrote 
articles, we send away to 
United Nations
 that we lost everybody, we live still on 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

the bloody soil, that we can™t
 walk on it to go back to
 Poland
. We can™t, they killing 
Jews again. And we don™t have no place to
 go. The only place we want is to have 
our own Jewish homeland, and that
 was that. I remember one act in
 Salzburg
 which 
I can never forget. There was two cousins, 
they survived the wa
r, and one of them 
had a carton of cigarettes with him. And the 
[indecipherable]
 policeman ask him 
what he have here. He didn™t
 want to show him and he es Œ he ran away. As he ran 
away, he shot him dead. And at that time, all the 
DP
 camps, 
Linz, Ebensee, 
all 
around 
Austria,
 from 
Polking
(ph), they wanted to come
 here and do something, 
damage to 
Salzburg.
 And the 
[indecipherable]
 police, because it was a policeman 
that shot him, and the 
MP,
 hide away. They  covered every road lead ing to 
Salzburg
, trucks or cars, because a lot of trucks came with 
DP s
 from
 Linz
. There 
were partisans a lot, that they used to be
 partisans. They came
 with hammers, they 
came even with weapons, what everything
, and we wanted to do something to 
demo lish 
Salzburg
. And th ey knew about it. So 
when the funeral came, they 
shipped back the people,

 they didn™t let 
them, they stood at the train st
ations. They  didn™t let no Œ no 
DP
 person, no Jewish 
person in to
 Salzburg.
 And they  covered the whol
e funeral march, we were 
cordoned off by the military police. We had 
to go in the middle 
of the road, they 
didn™t let nobody out. And we
 couldn™t Œ we couldn™t let out our anger to anything.

But we came to the cemetery, th ere was one house, which it was the caretaker™s, I 
think, and we put the house to fire. Which,
 I have pictures from the funeral, they™re 
here in the museum, which I gave them. We
 attended the funeral, I will never forget 
this. And that policeman, he ran away from
 Salzburg
, cause we said we are going 
to kill all the police there. But, we coul
dn™t do anything. There were the happenings, 
what was. I remember coming to 
Munich
. In the
 Munich
 was a march, which I still 
have the papers, which the Germans show 
what the Jews did there. They also 
starting demonstrating and Œ an d beati
ng up some Germans and th ings. And Œ 
because it was near 
Dachau
, they wanted to march to
 Dach au
, they didn™t allow. 
But I heard demonstrations in 
Mun i ch
 from displaced person people, they came 
from all over. And I used to go from camp to
 camp  if I can meet anything. That™s 
was the main thing. I went to 
Feldafing,
 I went to 
La ndsberg
, I went to 
Erfort
(ph), which I found in each camp some
 old friends, people from our city. I 
met at this station in
 Frankfurt
, a young girl, used to be 
friends with my sister, and 
she gave me a picture, in fact, from her 
sister on it, and another one a neighbor and 
my niece. And this picture was in the Re
d Cross, on the pamphlets advertising the 
Red Cross, the Holo caust 
[indecipherable]
 and I gave it also here to the mu seum. 
And that™s the stories. Wherever I came, 
I met some people. And finally, wh en we 
had the chance to go to the 
United States
, I said I had enough. I don™t want to see

any mo re 
Germany
 or anything and I would never go back. And came to the 
United States. 
When I came to the 
United States,
 the first thing is I went to my 
aunts. They waited for me, we came with the 
[indecipherable] 
ship. And 
everybody got sick, seasick, throw up. 
I think I was the only one walking around 
laughing, and I was the only one eating. 
When nobody could eat food, I was the 
only one. I had with me two watches that 
I took along to have some. So one of the 

crew people says, they going to  arrest you, you can™t have two watches. He just 
wanted one watch. He gave me 20 dollar, 
which the watch cost me over a hundred, 
and I had to  give it up. But then I talk, I wa
s foolish, I was just taken, it was too late. 
Two days before we arrive to 
United States
, what everybody got already well, 

when you should have
 see the screams in
 the morning on the 
ship. Everybody was 
laying on the decks, on the floor, why did 
I come to die on th e sea? Why couldn™t 
we die there in 
Europe
? That™s was the feeling of 
everybody. When 
everybody got 
well, even my  brother got well, I came w
ith my  brother together, I got start on 
getting sick. So I didn™t have a good arrival in 
New York
. When came to 
New 
York
, my  two aunts waited for me already with my  brother. And I can never 
forgive them, they we
re so nice, too nice, they want
 to do something for us. We 
didn™t even go home, straight from the ship she went 
Fifth Avenue
, bought for my  
brother, myself, hats w ith silk shawls, with shirts. Wanted me to try on a suit, I was

sick like dog still. And I couldn™t tell them 
an ything, they wanted 
to be nice and we 
came to the house, it was on the Œ prepared
 a big dinner. And right away, you are 
gonna be my  children, you are not going to  wo rk any more in your life no mo re. 
You are going to  live with us, you don™t have
 to put a finger in cold water, which I 
didn™t like it, I like to be independent. I 
stood there with my  brother for two weeks. 
Then I went for one week to my nephew. Wh
at I forgot to tell you, my nephew, it™s 
my  older sister™s son, he was in
 Vienna
, translator to General 
Clark
, and then he 
was translator for the American army in
 Vienna
. In 
Vien na
 as you know, there 
were all four, the Russians,
 the French, the English an
d the Americans. So every 
mo rning they have all four on one she Œ if
 you saw on the news
reel something. And 
he was the one, wh en ever they gave him 
orders what to do, where to go, he 
translated him in French, in
to English, into German. A
nd I have a lot of pictures 
him translating everything wh en th ey have
 the meetings, and he was the translator 
there as a young boy. I mean, I was very
 proud of him. Once he came to 
Salzburg
 
with a young girl, she was only 
14 years or 15 years old, 
Herta
(ph) 
Weiss
(ph). She 
was in 
Stutthof 
in camp, in 
Riga
 in camp, which was writte
n a book and the picture 
her father, that her father got shot there. 
It™s a whole story, a separate story about 
her. And he came to me, introduced me th
at we are going to get married. I says, 
you™re crazy, he™s a kid. Fell in love 
with her. He traced her all the way from

his name is also 
Mo n i ek
, after my 
grandfather™s name, but he changed his name. 
Tom, 
now, he says, you got to 
escape, because the Russians wanted to take
 you over to the Soviets. At that time 
they caught, you know, a lot of people, speci
al kind of people, and so right away he 
let know his superiors, was during the ni
ght, it didn™t take five minutes, they 
cordoned off the

from the army camp to

HIAS
, 
and then  he wanted to  go to  the 
Columbia University
. At that time, ™47, they didn™t 
take many Jews to 
Colu mbia

the paper and th e director from 
Columbia
 called him up. He Œ after talk with him, 
he was accepted. He was accepted and he wa
s accepted and for international law, 
and then  si Œ going seven years. He made
 it in  three years with scholarships and 
when I came to the 
States
 I stood with him, also for 
a week, which they were so 
nice to me, everything. And then  
I said I got to get away from
 New York

came here, so I got right away a job, I 
took a job in painting, because I knew

feel like tw o cents. So he got 12
 dollar a week for his work. He 
[indecipherable]
 
up. And it was very often 
[indecipherable]
. I cried every day, I wanted to go back. 
First of all, I didn™t know 
nobody. Then  wh en I had an 
apartment to get in, so s Œ 
there I work Œ I didn™t want to stay by 
my  brother, because the sister-in-law wasn™t 
so well, she was an American, sh e had a di

[indecipherable]
. So I says, I 
didn™t come to the 
United States 
and live like this, worse than even a camp, near a 
shoemaker with the smell and everything. I went on my  own and I found a room. I 
found a nice room there and we moved in
 right away. This 
was Sunday mo rning, 
we went right away to
 Reed™s
(ph) drugstore, we bought pots and pans. We went

baked the cakes and 
everything, right away she brought in

 which in the next morning 
it went to the garbage can. We were Œ 
I don™t know, we were so that from 
somebody™s hands we didn't  wa

54
I had to go, I didn't know not a 
wo rd of English. So I had to go to school, so I went 
to night school. After work  nine, 10 hours 
a day, cause I wanted to get mo re hours 
[indecipherable]
. Then my brother work

think. After working for somebody, what happened that the men what we worked 
couldn™t mix the color for a person for a

particular color. And of course I knew colo
rs very good and ev erything. So as he 
went Œ as he went to get material Œ as 
he went to get material, I mix for her the 
color. Oh, that™s exactly what
 I want. When he came back
, she says, I want him to 
do mixing th e colors, everything. And she to
ld  me, why don™t you
 go on your own? 
I says, I don™t know nobody, I don™t know
 the language or anything. She says, I 
give you a customer. So I quit them and I got the customer on my  own. From 18 

dollar, right away that she offered 
me 60. From 18 to 60 dollar, cause 
[indecipherable]
 a me chanic. So  he says no. You

and you were telling me about the Œ 
basically branching now out on

A: Yes, yes. Then I went on my own to
 wo rk, and I took my  brother right away, 
we™re not going to work fo
r 12 ah Œ 12 dollar a week
, you are going with me. 
Whatever is going to happen, is gonna
 happen. And it was very tough in  the 
beginning, with my  English, although we 
went to school. And I decided I got to do 
something with me. First of all w e wanted to
 get a grocery store. At that time almo st 
every surv ivor went into grocer
ies, because they didn™t have 
[indecipherable]
. So 
while I was work ing, one of the nicest pe
ople was that person who was in charge of 
the 
Exodus
 ship in
 Ba ltimo r e,
 Mr.
 Spierd
(ph) which he™s known. He was the one 
that brought everythi
ng, and the ship was 
[indecipherable]
 right in
 Baltimore.
 And 
his wife, she says no, you™re too intellig
ent, you don™t want to be a slave in a 
grocery store. You™re not married yet, yo
u won™t be able to find a girl. You don™t 
want to be shop. You go to  school, contin
ue and do what you™re
 doing, never go to 

a grocery. And I already had 
a lawyer and everything, we
 already got prepared  to 
buy this for everything, and I listened to 
her. Instead, I enlisted, I went to the 
Mary land
 
Institute of Art,
 to the art school. I went seven years to the art school

for interior design. I first graduated Œ ho
nest, I was the only one in th e ever class 
ever to get the medal, usually
 they give the medals for 
day school. I couldn™t go day 
school, I had to make a living. Worked 
durin g the day. I went post-graduate at 
seven years. Then  the teacher told me, 
you have talent, I se
nd you Œ which might 
not cost you for scholarship, to 
New York. 
But wh at happened  Œ and meanwh ile I 
got married already Œ 
Q: How did you meet your wife? 
A: I met my wife at a blind date. And before
 I come to this, I want to tell you I was 
miserable for the first year in the 
United States.
 I didn™t know nobody.
 Baltimore 
was like a little town. Every weekday Œ every Friday even
ing when I got my pay, 
when  I had money, I ran to the train right away, and 
New York
 because I have a lot 
of friends. 
Baltimore 
was a little town. If you want to
 go out with so mebody, you 
have either to know them Œ you couldn™t go to a dance like 
New York 
on your own, 
you have to belong somewhere, wasn™t as
 Œ even school, I was all the time called 
here comes the greenhorn. I wasn™t received 
not at all good. I went to the synagogue 
on a Saturday, all the ti Œ oh, here™s th
e greenhorn. I came for a sundae to a 
drugstore 
[indeciphera ble]
 made fun because I didn™t kn
ow so good English. So I 
let them have it in German, and I said, 
it™s miserable. They didn™t treat the 
newcomers at all good at that time. Th
e American people were not at all

57
[indecipherable]
. They Œ they treat us like third class, and I mean third class, that I 
wanted to  go back  to
 Europe
. But, with the time 
I met my wife. I met her in ™53, we 
went for a year time. I met her already in 
™5 2. We went over a year time, and then 
March 31
st
 we got married, to a Baltimorean gi
rl, so was a little different. And I 
work myself up, and I was looking for an 
apartment before, which it was very hard 
to get apartments because pe
ople thought we are going 
to have kids, they didn™t 
want 
[indecipherable]
. And I worked there 
by a builder, na Œ and at that time, and I 
finish a job early, so I went
 there to look for work for 
my own, to another builder. 
When  I came in, he asked me what I am looking th is house, 
[indecipherable]
 was 
there a painting contract? And I couldn™t say 
that I am lo oking for Œ for paint. So I 
says, I am interested in a home buying. Ok ay. I ask him how mu ch . It was 18 and a 
half thousand dollar home. And at that tim
e  t h ousand dollar, who had that kind of 
money 
[indecipherable]
. Then I 
[indecipherable]
 suppose I don™t finish this, and 
this I will do on my own, not
 only my own painting, but 
finishing off a lot of the 
walls and the bathrooms, knocked off this a
nd th is. He came down to about 15 and a 

half thousand dollar. Then I wo
rked for this builder at 
that time, I did Œ for his 
private home, and I told him, he says, oh, he
™s a friend of mine, let me go. He came 
to him, he says, do something for him, a
nd this and this. So he knocked it down  

another 1500 dollar. So I said, instead of
 paying rent somewhere, looking for a

house, I gave a down  payment. And I said
, I am buying this home. On a Satu rday I 
took a ride, I took my  fu ture wife, I wasn™t ma rried then 
[indeciphera ble]
 who can 
dream 
[indecipherable]
 home. This was the firs
t semi-detached homes in 
Baltimore
, beautiful. I said, this is yours, this
 is a present, she couldn™t believe. 
And I didn't have mo ney for furn iture, anyt
hing. And I had everything togeth er with 
my  brother. One bankbook. It didn™t matter 
w h at he makes, what a Œ I mean, when 
we split up, when we went
 for our honeymoon to 
New York
, when we came back, I 
only had money for a bed and th is. And of
 course she got some money from her 
parents, not mu ch. And my  brother, what
ever we had money in th e bank left, he 
bought a kitchen set, and he set up a bedr
oom, and we didn™t Œ we didn™t have any 
other furn iture, but this came piece by pie
ce. And unfortunately Œ or fortunately, I 
should say, I have very  expensive taste, 
which I just wouldn™t 
buy anything, I would 

Œ where I work, this was, I mean there 
lived the most richest people in Œ in
 
Mary land, 
that™s the customers I had. I was neve
r listed in the phone book, I Œ this 
was recommended 
[indecipherable]
 I was all the time three, four years lined up 
with work before, I Œ and I 
didn't  go ev erywhere, I just 
had a selected clientele. 
Then I wanted to go into interior design. 
Then I found out Œ that
™s what I graduated 
from Œ I didn™t go to 
New York
 because I have already a home here. Got my  wife 
here, I couldn't Œ not start all over again. So
, for interior design y
ou got to have a lot

of money, you got to open a 
business, you got to have y
our own material, you got to 
have a showcase, I just couldn™t do. Then
 I was recomm ended to interior designer 
Chambis
(ph), which she was the most known in 
Baltimore
, she told me okay, you 
can. And I said no, I-I am a boss on my 
own, I™m not going fo
r somebody. So I 
work  my self up all alone, and you know, I 
hired a lot of men, and then I had my  
builder™s work and I helped out decorating,
 which I got money fo r this too, but I 
could never 
[indecipherable]
 for opening my  own busine
ss for interior design. And 
I was happier with what I was doing and I 
was interested in my old hobby, this is 
philately
,
 stamps, which I started as a youngster
 six years old. I continued in the 
United States, this was by co
incident. I went down town 
Baltimore
, I saw a st a mp 
store, it was something familiar to me, and 
I started again. And I came to join the 
club in 
Baltimore
, the philatelic club, which I was one
 of the first Jewish people to 
join, because at that time there were only 
doctors and lawyers, only professionals, 
and I was actually the first one like to join
 with them. They liked me and I became 
right a memb er of the Œ there Œ the an Œ go
vernment of the Œ of the society. And I 
started also to put my  collections together 
in topics to exhibit, and I was startin g to 
get known internationally for 
my exhibit, my work. So Œ 
Q: What exhibit? You need to explain.

A: This was philatelic exhib
ition, which I was specially 
interested in Olympics. I 
was all the time following Olympi
c games in ™36. This was 
the first Olympics that I 
followed. So , and every mo rning I went thro ugh th e paper right away , who won 
this. I followed everything, and I started 
collecting Olympic stamps at that time, 
which I Œ every penny I made in
 Europe
, things, I Œ I bought stamps, and I was 
very knowledgeab le in it. And I have 
a good eye on good
 material to buy, 
everything. And I assemb led one of the 
best collections, probably , on Olympic 
history. And I was invited to 
Europe, 
I think the first exhibit was in ™74 in 
Israel
 Œ 
internationally the first, the other ones I 
exhibited mainly here, wh ich I won a nice 
prize. Then I was exhibiting other places, 
in the navy too, I had invitation from the 
Olympic committee fro m 
Italy, 
to exhibit as an American guest in 
Ro me.
 They  had 
Œ they invited 16 people from around th e wo rld, the mo st known Œ mo st known 
philatelists andOlympic commi
ttee members. First I declin
ed, I don™t have time my  
business. In the philatelic 
[indecipherable]
 they told me, this is the biggest honors 
you can have, and you are going to recline?
 They  send you ticket. Then  I Œ I send a 
telegram, so right away they 
send a telegram back to go 
Philadelphia 
and go to 
Washin gton
. I Œ from everywhere, tickets, special 
plane, and I had to take to the 
Italian emb assy my collection, that goe
s by pouch, you know,
 which they took 
along from the embassy, they
 took my collection there, and I was treated royally

there. We were about 18 people there, ev
ery day special dinners, special things, go 
out. If I went to the synagogue on a s Œ 
on Saturday , I have a bus for a hundred  
people going with me, with one person.
 Of course I took along a Polish guy 
[indecipherable]
 and a German guy, which they went
 with me, they wanted to see 
the synagogue in 
Rome
. And I was invited for the 95
th
 congress, which was the 
Olympic congress in Œ in
 Ro me
, and from then on I got 
very popular. Then I was 
invited to most of the international show
s, which I was judging also, I became an 
apprentice judge first, and international. A
nd I went to every Olympic, I was invited 
free. They paid for my trav
el, they paid for my hotel, 
for the food. They gave me 
pocket money. And I built up my collection 
through my knowledge, which was one 
Œ one of the greatest Olympic collections 
in the world. Ther
e were only a few Œ 
very few more in this 
[indeciphera ble]
 and I think I was the only in the 
United 
States 
this. And then I was also interesting Œ 
in the 50™s I saw a advertising in the 
German paper, ﬁThe 
Aufbau
,ﬂ about somebody has a 
[indecipherable]
 stamp from 
the ghetto. I was very interesting and I bought a 
[indecipherable]
 the first was the 
Bansburg
(ph) ghetto. And I di
dn't even know it exists, this 
kind of mater ial in  the 
50™s. And as I went from show to show, I ask 
[indecipherable]
 and this, and then I 
found out that I can buy some material. 
And I started assemb ling a collection on 
ghettos and especially on Holo
caust. Which I assembled one of the largest private

collection in the world, which 
I exhibited international, in 
[indecipherable]
 
Bulgaria
, in 
Spa in
, in 
England
, in
 Israel, 
which I 
[indecipherable]
 in
 
J oha nnesburg
. Last year I exhibited and Œ this year 
[indecipherable]
 in 
J oha nnesburg
 and 
Israel
 and I just came from 
Nuremberg
, I exhibited there, I 
gave several lectures on the Ho locaust, a
nd mine collection is very  well known, and 
I write a lot of articles on Holocaust material
, and I give a lot of lectures on it. Now 
I have to put togeth er a collection on 
concen tration camp s, and subcamps and 
forced labor camps, w h ich I have about 8,
000 pieces, but I don™t have the time to 
put down. So far 
[indecipherable]
 on my  ghetto collection, wh ich I™m very happy, 
and I give a lot of lectures
. And in ™91 Œ in ™91, I ha
d a phone call from the Jewish 
council. They called me up that they star
ting to open up a Ho
locaust tracing center 
in 
Baltimore,
 which this is the first center in  the 
United States
 all over,
 
and 
Baltimore
 became the headquarters of it. Th
ey called me up, I says, I know, 
because they know me from e
xhibits all the time, the 
JCC
, I exhibited in 
Baltimore
 
the city, whenever it™s 
Yom Ha Sho ah
. Okay, I will go over ther
e. They interviewed 
me there, it was not open yet, but they in
terviewed me, they lo
ck ed  th e d oo r, we 
don™t let you out. You know too mu ch. Y
ou be very good fo
r us. You know the 
languages and you translate 
[indecipherable]
. Okay, since I retir ed from work, I™m 
going to  do something. So I started and I st
art to come every day there, then four

times a week. And then, when 
Gorbachev 
came to power, you know, they started 
to open up, you know, on th ere in th
e archives from th
e Holocaust, from 
Auschwitz
, death books and everything. There was a young lady in 
Baltimore,
 
came to an idea, why don™t 
we open up a center, we ca
n find and something to do 
for survivors, so on. And 
Washington [indecipherable] 
the main headquarter 
[indecipherable]
 was. And that™s where I started out
, I started out from the first day 
on. Then , when  they  find anything, so one Œ 
one official that st
arted  working on the 
Holo caust before they opened up, he was Œ 
he let know that Red Cross that we have 
some important material in 
Suitland,
 in the National Archives
, that can be used for 
names and so on for the Holocaust. So 
we had out about 12 people, twice a week, 
before they wanted everything twice a 
week. We had a driver from the Red Cross 
and took us to 
Suitland
. After just two weeks, 
Haverford
(ph) quit. He couldn™t 
take it, it w as too much, you know, when th
ey read the stories, and a lot of them 
couldn™t understand either, because you 
know, you have to know languages. I 
decided Œ it was very tough 
on me because everything came back to me. I never 
wanted to talk about the Holocaust at hom
e, never did. Never to nobody, I never 
mentioned, I never wanted to watch a pictur
e of the Ho locaust, anything to do with 
it. But here, everything came back on me. Horrible stories. And 
when I read there 
some stories, what I thought I went throu
gh bad, then  I said, I was in the luxurious

hotel, not in the camp. What people went th
rough, especially Œ especially in hiding 
place. And we remained only a few of them. 
Q: I need to interrupt you for one minute. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You Œ you reference 
Suitland. 
Can you please establish on tape what you are 
talking about? What is 
Suitland
? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Explain it. 
A: Yes. 
Suitland
 is the National Archives that™s 
the fourth largest depository and 
archive from the war in the 
[indecipherable]
. They were Œ peop
le come from all 
over the world to look for archives and ever
ything is there. If you want to see from 
the Civil War, if you want to see about an
ything with the Indians, parts of lands, 
how Œ ev erything™s there. But particularly
 is what we were interested on war 
material, th ey have in 
Suitland
 33 tons, and I™m talking 
tons of material on the 
second World War, wh at the American 
army confiscated from archives in 
Germany
, 
Italy, Yugoslavia, France
 and 
Austria
 and 
Czechoslovakia
. And we 
were work ing, we had there Œ th
e main one from the Red Cross was
 Suzanne 
Artivelis
(ph)
,
 which she is now head fro
m the Christian society in 
Africa
 she 
work s. And we Œ several people. And we we
re interested in finding names. What 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
65
we found in names, the names what we r
ecorded, we put down Œ in every section 
we put in, we put in pieces of paper and th en  once a month they  came and they 
copied th is microfilming, which they gave
 to the Red Cross and then which it was 
sent to 
Germany
, to 
Arlsen
(ph), to the archives for the 
tracing, Holocaust tracin g. 
If somebody traced, you know, all the time, th
ey sh Œ we knew names where they, if 
they died  there or not, but they  had them
, the names, they™re there. And we found 

that books which we record
ed, over 400,000 names, wh
ich we gave to president 
from the Red Cross, Mrs. 
Dore
(ph), it was on television, I think, I discovered a lot 
of things. But aside to looking for na
mes on the Œ as a historian and from my  

personal things, anything th at concerned Juda
ism, or Jewish thing, important things, 
because people couldn™t read, they just Œ th
-the American people they didn™t know 
languages, just names and they  knew the na
mes and they put in 
where to copy this. 
But I looked thro ugh documents, and I had th
e sharp eye, I just ful Œ I knew right 
away, when I start tak ing a batch with do
cuments right away, I knew right away 
what™s there, what to look
 up. Whenever has to someth
ing with Jewish history, I 
copied. I did mo re spend money there in
 copying Œ co pying documents, which th ing 

Œ they all are, what are you doing, what ar
e you doing, that I am
 all tying up the wi 
Œ don™t worry. I have my  names everything,
 but besides that, I have assemb led over 
10,000 
Xerox
 copies from the museum, which a lot 
of it were not even declassified, 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
66
I declassified thousands and th ousands of 
pieces there. And I came across material 
that™s not known to now
here. Of course, I™m go 
[indecipherable]
. I Œ I have at 
home that I recorded, over 500 pages of
 documents that came out from the 
American embassy in
 Ankara, Turkey, 
which has to do with a Jewish question, a 
request from 
[indecipherable]
 from 
Palestine
, and also from the 
United States
 
with a request to President
 Roosevelt
 to rescue 405 rabbis from 
Europe.
 In the 
beginning, he said okay. This was in 
ninet Œ beginning ™41,
 which was already 
known what™s happening in  
Europe
. Of course, he got in touch with Mr. 
Eden
 
from
 England. 
So
 Eden, 
right away 
[indecipherable]
 anything, you are going to 
try to rescue 405 Jews? All Euro pean Jews 
are going to co me to you. We don™t have 
ships, we have a war going on. What do y
ou need them for? Let™s forget it. Well, 
anyway, it came Œ it came then, it came 
Karski
 also, it™s know what he did here, 
what™s happening, and the 
[indecipherable]
 day, I have names written down , who Œ 
who was the representative and everything. Even 
Stev en Weiss
 was also connected 
with it. So, he promise Œ he prom
ised then, he said, where would 
[indecipherable]
 
means money. Once they had to send 25,0
00 pounds, which they send it. 25 pow Œ 
thousand pounds was a lot of money, it wa
s over five dollar a pound at that time. 
Then another 15,000 pound. Finally they ca
me up that they have to buy a ship. 
There was a ship on the 
Black Sea
, and they had permis
sion from the Turkish

government, when they come to 
Turkey
, to the 
Bla ck Sea
, through 
Bulgaria
, they 
will let them in only for one nigh
t. Then they will go Œ go to 
Palestine.
 
Palestine
, 
the British only allowed th
em one night to be in
 there to come to 
United States. 
But 
of c-course, delaying, de
laying, you wi Œ ev erythi
ng Œ you know what happened 
with the Holocaust, nobody™s a
live. What we have on record  is about 35 rabbis that 
they came out alive, whic
h they  escaped to the 
Soviet Unio n
. And late in ™44, when 
it was known there are no more Jews, finally 
Roosevelt
 gave in. They sent in Œ they 
sent in to all the friendly embassies in 
Europe, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, 
if 
somebody would list the name of the rabbis 
and if somebody comes here, give him 
the visa. So we have a undersecretary 
Long 
here, which he was a anti-Semite, and 
he send Œ write the letters, be
fore anything, I want to kn
ow who they are and what 
to know. I have all documents home. 
Q: Now, I™m Œ I need you to clarify something th at I™m not Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ quite sure I understand. You said yo
u made copies of these things from the 
archive Œ 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Œ and you said two th ings that I Œ I 
need you to clarify. One is that you 
declassified  them, and I™d Œ 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ like you to  explain that. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And also you s Œ you said that th
ese are now in the museum. What is Œ 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 the museum. 
[indecipherable]
 in the museum. 
Q: Okay , please clarify those two points. 
A: I will clarify. First of all, when 
we looked through, 
don™t forget 33,000 
documents, a lot, 90 percent was not decla
ssified yet because nobody came to those 
documents yet, which I discovered them fo
r the first time. And 
when  I wanted  to 
copy this, I can™t copy
 this til they™re now d
eclassified. So I have 
to go to the head 
of the archives, he put in 
a stamp with a little note decl
assified the date, the day 
with the year, everything, requested for de
classification and then  she put on a stamp 
declassified, and then  I could 
Xero x
 th at, yes. And I have at home at least 5,000 
documents which I decl
assified because nobody saw them before.  
Q: And what of your collection Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ is now in the 
U.S. Holoca ust Memorial Museum
? 
A: I would say about 60 percent, I have a 
lot of them, they™re not. For instance, the 
names of the rabbis. I have every name. 
I have from which synagogue they belong, 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
69
from which county. Fo
r instance, they have 105 rabbis from 
Lithuania
, that™s about 
198 rabbis exact from 
Poland
. They have one rabbi from
 Estonia
, from
 Latvia
, 
from
 France
, from
 Germany
, from 
[indecipherable]
 all 
Europe. 
And this 
documents, I gave a talk on it which I™m go 
Œ I Œ in my book th
at I hope to write, 
these documents are g o ing to be shown, becau
se a lot of them Œ I want to say this 
[indecipherable]
 some tape, but a lot of them are 
not declassified yet, which I have. 
So, I™m a little bit scared. 
Q: I have seen a few of the things
 that you have in your possession Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ that are not 
Xerox
 copies of documents. 
A: Yeah, right. 

Q: And they™re not stamps. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Te Œ I would like you to  Œ before I go 
back and find mo re about your personal 
life, as long as we™re on this I™d like y
ou tell me about your 
personal collection of 
historical artifacts. 

A: Yes, yeah, mine personal collection of
 historical artifacts, especially on the 
Holocaust. I acquired this through auctions
, through dealers. Of course no Œ i-in 
here. And a lot of material, which I realize 
now, which I got info rmation, was stolen 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

70
out from archives in
 Poland, 
especially from the Jewi
sh Œ from the Jewish 
Historical Society on the 
Litzmannstadt
 ghetto, which I didn™t want to buy 
anything, but there I came to one particular
 item, which I said if I™m not going to 
buy, somebody is going to buy. It™s 
Œ it™s never will go back to the museum 
anyway. And I know it was stolen out from 
the museum, but at that time, everybody 
Œ every Pole we had a hand in the mu seum
, what does he think ab out Jewish things? 
There were mostly Gentile people, and th
ey stole them out, but loads of them, 
suitcases, which 
they came to 
United States 
and they  were auctioned off here, and I 
bought them and I have a lot of documents. I have docu ments from 
Hitler
 also. I 
have documents from
 Himmler
, signed by 
Himmler,
 other thin gs. I bought this at 
the auctions. I bought in 
Switzerland
. In the 60 Œ I was pretty
 lucky, the original 
telegram from the
 
Crystal
 
Night, when  Crystal Night broke out, when 
Herschel 
Grynszpan 
shot 
vom Rath 
in the embassy, it was the f 
Œ one of the first teleg rams 
that came o u t from 
Paris, 
sent to
 Berlin
, and it Œ it™s a backstamp a picture of 
Herschel Grynszpan 
that they sent by wire, backstamp 
Scheid el
(ph)
. Scheidel
(ph) 
is like 
Reuter
 news, this is
 Scheidel
(ph). It™s the original telegram that 
[indecipherable]
 wh at they call him, you know, in German. 
Herschel Seibel 
Grynszpan
, I ever Œ never knew that he had a middle name, nobody knew. His 
name is 
Seibel
(ph), like the original telegram, wh
ich th ey have now a copy in the 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

71
mu seum. O-Of course it™s gonna remain la
ter on in  the mu seum, but for time being 
I hold onto it, but I have copies in th
e mu seum. I have other documents. I have 
documents from 
SS 
even, things which were taken 
away by soldiers, which I got 
them. Is one picture that I acquired even  in 
Vidin
(ph) from a friend of mine, which 
he personally took away 
from a German soldier, how 
they cut the curls, the 
sidecurls from Jews with th
e beards, that I have it, all the other documents. And I 
work ed fo r about seven years in
 Suitland 
in the archives, and th
en they went over 
to 
College Park
 and then I stopped, I didn™t have time and I had a drive a day from 
the Red Cross they supplied, and I did a lot of
 research there, plus
 my research that 
I know. And while I was working there,
 Bob Casting
(ph), he should rest in peace, 
one of the nicest, mo st knowle
dgeable guys probably  that 
this institution ever had, 
he worked in 
Suitland 
in the archives and a lot of tim
es whatever I found, I gave it 
to him, to 
Bob.
 I was introduced, and Œ 
and then he asked me 
Morris
, how about 
coming over the mu seum, work 
for some. This was on a case that he had. So I did, 
and since then I™m with the 
museum, working in the archiv
es on a lot of things. And 
I wouldn™t say that I enjoy these things, 
what I look, who I work  on the microfilms, 
on Œ wh ich came out from 
Poland
 now in ™55, the 
[indecipherable]
 they have, 
which I work already tw o years on it. And 
it™s not pleasant y
ou Œ wh en you read, 
but somebody got to do it, and 
the people that they can tran slate, that we can do the 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

72
stories, if they™re not going to  do, who is
 going to  do this later? There™s Yiddish 
especially. It™s not a dying language, bu
t yet very, very few 
people know. If it™ s 
printed they know, but handwriting, if it™
s handwritten, which I took along a lot of 
them, 
Xerox
 copies, maybe somebody can help me
 out, I have so 
mu ch  w o rk . E v en  
to the rabbinical college in Œ the college in 
Baltimore, 
the rabbi, no, they wouldn™t 
do it, it™s too hard  because it™s fancy Yidd
ish and this, but I managed to do. And 
somebody got to do, and I enjoy the people 
here to work with and I learn a lot 
through what I read, through Œ a person can
 never say he knows everything. It™s Œ 
it™s Œ it™s Œ believe me, I have a lot Œ a lot to
 learn to Œ to know. 
But, a lot of things 
that I learned here, and it™s good to kn
ow. I wrote many, many articles of this 
subject, and Œ and I have a lot Œ in fact I ha
ve here an article that I just wrote about
 
Stutthof, 
the camps in 
Stutthof
, with all archival wo
rk  do cu men ts fro m my  
collection, with letters from
 Stutthof
 and it™s all there fo r future generations, and I 
hope to write a book, so for future ge
nerations, they can learn a lot about it. 
Q: Le-Let™s pause and change tape. 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

73
Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: Œ Holocaust artifacts, and I-I™m very curiou
s to ask if you have
 any idea what the 
value of this collection is, historically and financially. 
A: Yeah, well, historical, it™s very va-valuabl
e. I have a lot of unique items in postal 
history. Fo r instance, I have 
letters. A letter from Kaiser 
[indecipherable]
 wh ich  
it™s the only one known . From 
[indecipherable]
. I have from some ghettoes that the 
ghettoes were only a hundred Jews, not quite a hundred , I Œ from there. I have 
historical letters, which letters could ge
t out from the ghettoes, the people couldn™t 
get out. And everything was censored there,
 censored by the Je
wish Œ by the Jewish 
council has to be censo red. If anything was 
written there, they were Œ they could be 
punished and even shot. But, you know, in
 the ghetto slang,
 which the Germans 
couldn™t understand right. Fo r instance, I have a postcard from mine city, written 
from an aunt to a niece. And sh e writes, my 
liebers
(ph)
 kin
, this is mine last writing 
to you. We expect an Uncle 
Ma lch amov i s
, and I will have to go with them. The 
Germans thought Uncle 
Malchamovis
 is a name.  
Q: But Œ 

A: But it™s not. Then I Œ 
Q: No, no, please explain. 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
74
Q: What 
Ma lchamovis
(ph) is. 
A: 
Uncle Malchamovis
(ph) is a Hebrew name, the angel of death, so the Germans 
wouldn™t understand what it is. But 
the person receiving th is card knows 
Uncle 
Malchamovis
 what it is, and she knew where she 
is going. Other letters that I h ave 
in ghetto slang, that reveals the panic th
ere, which in fact I™m gonna write now a 
article about postal history from the g-ghe
tto during th e war, it reveals the pain and 
the suffering of the Jewish people. With ev
eryone listed in ghetto slang, we have a 
lot of material on this, of the news how 
many people got killed there. For instance, 
you have postcards with a request to a Jewish
 consul, to a Œ the le Œ th-the head of 
the Jewish ghetto, we don™t 
hear from this and this fa
mily, can you write? And he 
says, well, they™re buried in this and th
is cemetery. So how can it be that four 
people from one family is buried, died in 
the same day? Must be something. So , as 
a archivist I look documents, I lo ok through 
things. I found out on 
this and this day, 
they murdered 650 Jews. Th
ey put them in the synago
gue, and put the fire the 
synagogue. And these are things you learn 
from it. And this is this Œ you got to 
write about it, what happened. And you ha
ve the documentation, it™s not just that 
something nice can come 
[indecipherable]
 happen, it™s everything written the 
postcard. And th ey can™t deny because th
is was censored, by the Germans censor, 
everything. I have from the camps, going fro
m the ghetto into th
e camps, letters, 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

postcards. And this irreplaceable, you can™
t put in a value on it. On a history you 
can™t put the value. And to sell, I don™t 
know what you Œ depends
 on the collector. I 
thinks that I paid 5,000 dollars for an ite
m, for one letter, which is extremely rare. 
Q: In your work in th
e Holocaust Museum Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ do you ever wo rk  with th e public? 

A: With the public here, not, but I do a lot, 
I give talks to charities. I gave talks to 
universities, and I do this about 10 to 15 
times a year. I gave a talk about two years 
ago in 
Fort Meade
 fo r the army  people, wh ich it happened it was the ninth of May, 
the anniversary of the end of the second
 Wo rld War. Was about 300 officers there 
present, they wrote me up in the paper, in
 fact they wrote me up in two papers. 
Well, I came there. I didn™t talk much ab
out the Jewish Holocau
st, because I don™t 
know who th e people are. Gentile Œ it 
depends. In schools, in schools or 
[indecipherable]
 I tell them the Holocaust. Army
 people is a different thing. I 
wanted to disclose to them, whic h the army doesn™t know if Œ the 
United States 
population doesn ™t know wh at
 happened to American 
POWs
 during the war. Their 
holocaust, which people don™t understa
nd, they don™t know, wh ich I have 
documents from the second Wo
rld War that I copied, and it™s everything in the 

archives. In what ma
nner they killed the 
POWs
, also death marches, which it™s not

known th at they went through death marc
hes. There™s a death march with 8,000 
British 
POWs
 from
 Poland
 
[indecipherable]
, they took them through the snow 
and everything, that I found in the arch
ives, a book from a major, fro m a British 
major with the names who got 
killed, shot on the road, th
ey couldn™t make it. So 
many of them, thousands got 
killed from the 8,000. This is not known, and the 
public don™t know. And they opened their 
eyes when they hear
d what they did to 
the American soldiers, how th
ey  buried them with the heads up, which you can find 
pictures in si Œ and now it™s in Œ in college 
[indeciphera ble]
, with the heads up, 
buried. I have a fact, a Jewish soldier, wh
ich I have a docu ment with the picture, 
everything. When  they Œ wh en they  captur
ed  him they found a 
pray er book, which 
they have the army prayer 
books, the Jewish people, 
they took aw ay everything. 
Then they wanted to take off his ring, an
d it wouldn™t come off from the ki Œ finger. 
They  took a shovel and cut off his finger to 
get the ring. Then  they buried th em with 
the heads up, and when the 
American army came in and they saw them burying the 
head, they kept them Œ th
ey kept them from the Amer
ican army , we should bury 
them here. He says, don™t ta
ke no prisoners from them, look wh at they did to  them. 
And this is the anger, but today the popu
lation don™t understand what the Germans 
did to them. The Œ they don™t k
now that over two million Russian 
POWs
 were 
killed by the Nazis in 
Buchen wald  
also. There were between
 three and 400 killings

every day in  
Buchenwa ld
, that they had the barrack there, it was called by 
telephone, 91. When  they called them up, they
 knew what it is, they were dressed as 
doctors. They put them in Œ they put them into this ba
rrack, and it was just Œ just 
like a doctor 
effice
 Œ office for examine your eyes, the height, and everything. And 
they took prisoners, a lot of prisoners in one time, every night wh at was going on. 
And they examined their teet
h, th ey examined their ey
es, everything. Then they 
took one by one into  a next room, whic
h it was against the wall to measure the 
height. But there was a slot there, and they
 put with the heads back and th ere he got 
right away  a bullet in his back head an
d this was going all night long. In  the 
morning they cleaned everythi
ng off, they had to have a 
plumber to unplug from the 
blood and everything. They  captured those 
people, they captured the people after 
the war. Wh at did th ey do to th em? I found documents, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s unbelievable 
that the American government could do 
this. I have a docu ment wh ich a German 
officer, a doctor decapitated a g Œ a-an Amer
ican officer. He took
 his head, put them 
in a liquid, get off the flesh, everything. He
 bleached his skull, and it Œ he sent his 
wife a souvenir for mantelpiece. They ca
ught this, and now the 
German told them, 
and he wanted to save his life. And he 
was among 45 other German prisoners what 
they killed 
[indecipherable] 
other places. And of course, 
he was sentenced to death 
by hanging. So the Germans were very smar
t, and very smart lawyers, right away 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

got Œ they got petitions fro
m the people from that 
city which that doctor 
[indecipherable]
 decapitated the soldier. They got 
over 5,000 names that he was a 
good citizen, he went to church every S unday, that he has a old mother, how can 
she die knowing if he™s gonna be killed? 
He has two small kids. How will the kids 
live the rest of the life he™s going to get k
illed. And a letter included that came from 
the Vatican, which I have a copy, a 
document, which it went to General 
Clay
, 
which he was the governor of
 Euro pe
 from the American army , if you are going to 

kill those 45 people, you are 
not any better than the Nazi
s, because the war is over. 
So they commuted them. Of course they got
 commuted to life. The lawyers were so 
smart, they send in the petition to 
Washin gton, 
not explaining th at they were 
commu ted from hanging to  life, but they said
 they were sentence
d to life. And with 
the same th ing with their signatures. So 
that particular person was commu ted to 25 
years. After sitting 
Landsberg
 for five years only, for g
ood behavior they let him 
out free. I have the documents to show. 
Wh at do we say to the parents from that 
poor soul that he got decapitated? They
 walking around free. And of course the 
Cold  War there so they  did away ever
ything, it™s known for it. And it hurts.  
Q: You mentioned you do a lot of public speaking Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and you have quite an extensive collection  

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ now. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: But you didn™t talk about 
it in the past. Do you have children an d if yes, what did 
you tell your children about your ch
ildhood and your experiences in 
Europe
? 
A: Well, I never wanted to 
talk from anything, but my s
on, when I was invited to 
talk to a church in 
Stevenson,
 there in 
Baltimore
, so him with his wife came, and I 
think that™s the first time he ever heard this
, because I never wanted to talk at home. 
And he knows a lot of times when I watch a f
ilm that Œ that I cry a lot. I don™t cry, I 
walk out, so he knows this. And he Œ he
 knows more about things. And I told him 
about my  collection. A lot of it I donated, a lot of 
[indecipherable]
. Every time I 
come here I give some here to the museum. 
Of course, I can™t give everything to the 
mu seum, cause I got kids to leave some money, cause all my  money, I never did the 
bank, everything went to buy this stuff,because I figured, I went through so much, 
let me enjoy what I want
 with my collections.  
Q: How many ch ildren do you ha
ve and how old are they? 
A: Yeah, I have two boys. On e just got his birthday in July, his 40
th
 birthday and 
one is 38. He is married, and I have my
 first grandchild, which sh e is 18 months 
old, beau tiful girl. But the only thing th at I 
complain, he is all th
e time travelin g on

planes for a Œ his job demands a lot, he gi
ves lectures and this, he travels all over. 
For instance, he was only six weeks a
go, th e first time they send him to 
Israel
, he 
was only for a day and a half, he saw my  sist
er only for 10 minutes, that™s all. H e is 
all the time on the travel, and with a young ki
d. Bu t he is very well loved. My  other 
boy is so-so here. And then my wife, unfor
tunately not so well, when you get a little 
older, with different things, and so it™s not 
easy, but I manage to do everything. And 
I™m going to talk a lot abou
t my family, what happened. 
Q: I Œ I do want you to go over and tell me
 what happened to the memb ers of your 
family, but I would like to ask you for a fe
w moments to reflect 
about some of the 
things that happen
ed while you were 
in this country. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: And the first thing that
 co mes t o  my  min d  is th e 
Eichmann 
trial. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you follow the 
Eichmann 
trials? 
A: Yeah, sure. Well, the 
Eichmann
 trial I did follow, a
nd my  brother-in-law was 
there. In fact, I have letters 
from Œ  from the prosecutor, from the 
[indecipherable]
 
trial, which they gave to my brother-in-law for writing all those articles. He Œ he 
writes a lot for the army and everythi
ng. And what both
ered me from the 
Eichmann
 trials especially, when my  brother-in-
law wrote me a letter, he says he Œ 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

81
I can™t understand. There were Israelis at 
the trial, and he overheard young Israelis, 
what kind scared people are the Jews? Co
uldn™t they fight b
ack, that they were 
killed like nothing, and everything. And I got
 very aggravated about it. I saw Œ I 
was once on 
Yo m HaSho ah
 in 
Baltimore
. It was couple days sitting past me, he 
says, 
Morrie,
 don™t you Œ couldn™t I fight back, they
 go to be killed? Just Œ just Œ 
just whatever they tell them
 to do it? And when I was Œ 
I was invited to go with a 
group of Polish officers for the 50
th
 anniversary of the Battle of 
Monte Cassino
. So 
I figured I™m gonna go, I was the only Jewish person who 
[indecipherable]
, which 
I went with them, we went to 
Ossiah
(ph),
 
we wen t to
 Vienna
, we went to
 
Budapest
 and th en 
Italy
, to all the cemeteries wher
e were soldiers from the 
[indecipherable]
 army were killed in
 Italy
 and th ey are buried there. And it™s a lot 
of Jewish soldiers are buried ther
e. People don™t know about it. In
 Verona
, other 
places. In the
 Monte Cassino
 we have about between 36 to  40 Jewish soldiers 
buried there. So one of the ladies
 here, a very intelligent woman from
 Chicago
, 
she™s a teacher for music and a artist. And 
we were very close because with her I 
talk intelligent manner. And she told me, she says
 Morris
, you tell me one thing. 
Look at the Israelis how they fight and 
this. How come the Jews never fought there 
in Œ in Œ in 
Poland
. So I ask her wha Œ and then it burned me up, so I ask a 
question. I says, 
Stasia
(ph) tell me, how co me that 15,000 Po lish officers, they were

officers, not regular army people, were killed in 
[indecipherable]
 murdered in 
[indecipherable]
, they never fought b
ack. By the way, there were over 800 Jewish 
soldiers that got killed, officers got killed in 
[indecipherable]
 wh ich I have Œ the 
names I have in the archives, 
I was working the archives in 
Warsaw
, I found th e 
names, everything. Tell me that th e same
 valiant soldiers fro
m the Russian army, 
that they captured 
Berlin
, everything, fo ught so gallantly against the Nazis, over 
two and a half million got killed, and they
 went like sheep to the slaughter. They 
didn™t fight back. I said, how come so many British 
POWs
 got killed, they never 
fought back? In
 Poland
 they never fought back. I sa
id, who were the first ones to 
fight, with nothing? It was the Jewish uprising in  
Wa rsa w
 ghetto. I said, you show 
me in all the mankind history,
 if a person Œ if a army  
[in d ecipherable]
 is in 
defense, there is no uprising, they don™t. Only  wh en 
[indecipherable]
 there™s 
uprisings. I said, the Polish uprising in
 Wa rsa w
, when did it co
me? When the 
Russian army were near th Œ near th
e Œ over there. And they were near 
Praga
 and 
they didn™t come in, they 
la-later on killed the Polish upr
ising. That™s what they 
wanted. So then wh
en the Œ the Pole Œ I said
, people fought back in
 Sobibor 
in the 
camp. They fou
ght back even  
Auschwitz
. They fought back anywhere they can, 
even the ghettos, when they
 Œ when they saw uniforms fo
r the army Œ for the army, 
I said. I sa i d , Jewish people fought. I 
said, t w o Œ two and 
a quarter mill ion Œ

250,000 Russian soldiers, Jewish soldiers 
got killed fighting the Nazis, it™s a fact. 
How many Jews in the British army fell? In
 the French army, in the Greek army, 
everywhere they fought. How many Jewi
sh soldiers fell a
nd fought against the 
Nazis, American soldiers? You go and tell me
 that they didn™t fi
ght back. Give them 
a chance with what to fight
 back, but they fought.  
Q: During your years in the 
United States
 Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ did you beco me involved  with any of
 the Holocaust organizations that were 
not related to the mu seum, the Œ the survivors™ groups, anything like that? 
A: Well, when we started out in  
Baltimore
 when we came, there w as a survivors™ 
group, we had meetings, but only
[indecipherable]
 for three years. What happened, 
people didn™t have time, where they have 
the groceries, mo st of them went to 

grocery stores. They were 12 hours a day,
 they slept there and everything. They 
were dis-integrated. I mean, not particularly
 Œ there was a Œ I tried to Œ I tried to 
form a group, without success. I tried 
even to  put out a Ho locaust mu seum in 
Baltimore
, which I went to the biggest people,
 which they give donations in the 
heavy thousands, hundreds of thousands,
 but to have their name on it. But 
something like this, I went to them, they 
told me, wa Œ what do 
you need here? It™s 
going to  be a mu seum in 
Wash ington
, it™s a museum 
Los Angeles,
 what do we

need this here? I told them, you don™t ne
ed much, just give 
me a room, like they 
have in 
Chicago
, they  have in 
Los Angeles,
 there™s a little museum. I will give the 
material. In  fact, I was ashamed. Three 
years ago they  called me from the Jewish 
Council, they have the teachers, th
e Catholic teachers convention in 
Baltimore
. So 
they wanted to put 
up a little exhibit, so there Œ 
at the table from the Jewish 
Council, which I exhibited there, and I was 
there. And they found out that I wanted 
to put up a museum and to donate this material. That pr
iest from the church came to 
me, we will Œ you donate th
e material, we will have in 
the church a little museum. 
So I says, I am very sorry. I can loan 
you the material, but you asking a little too 
much. What the Christians 
killed so the Jews, and Œ an
d Œ and the priests didn™t do 
anything, you ask me from the people, fro
m the victims to donate this kind of 
material to a church? I mean Œ  

Q: This coming week Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ there is going to be a march in 
Wa sh ingto n
 Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ of th e neo-Nazi groups. 
A: Yes. 
Q: There have been several of these over the years
. 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen

85
A: Yes. 
Q: How do you respond to 
the neo-Nazis and the skinh
eads in this country and do 
you think th e American Jewish co
mmunity should be concerned? 
A: How can you respond? Wh
en  I reme mb er when  they  opened Œ the opening of the 
Holocaust Museum, what is th
is, almo st six years ago.Ri
ght in front there, where 
survivors came in were Nazis there marchi
ng with placards and the police didn™t do 
nothing. Wh at 
[indecipherable]
? It™s free of speech here
, they say, you can do 
everything. But they  don™t know from 
these speeches, what
 they have now, 
especially on the Web and everything, it 
can be another Holo caust. How can I 
react? And the best thing, let them go, not to
 put even the papers this was a march. I 
ca Œ I started, I never wanted to  talk about 
the Holocaust at all, but when  did I start? 
W h en  I h e ard  in
 Skokie
 what was go on the marches. Then I woke up and I says, 
now I got to do something, now it™s about time I opened my  big mouth. 

Q: How do you think th e Ho locaust has ec 
Œ influenced some of the choices that 
you™re made in your life personally, professionally? 
A: Well, with everything I am very bitter. 
If you Œ you ask me a
bout religion. I was 
very bitter, because where was God, and ev
ery survivor will tell you. And if people 
wouldn™t be that fanatic of religious, b
ecause a lot of people couldn™t before the 
war, go to 
Palestine
 at that time, but they said no, 
they have to wait til the Messiah. 

 
Interview with Morris Rosen  
 
August 5, 1999 
 

 
 
86
It wouldn™t happen. A lot of
 people, if they would have cut their beards and th is, 
they could have maybe survived . They  didn™
t. And wh at I found out, a lot of people 
that they were so religious 
before the war, friends of mi
ne, they became the biggest 
thing, they eat everything no
t kosher, they wouldn™t ev
en go to a synagogue, not 
even on 
Yom Kippur
. And a lot of people that they were not religious, became 
religious. And I tell you, it Œ ma Œ I think my
 boys suffered a lot in the beginning of 
it, because they saw me and i-it Œ it does so
mething to the kids. It does something. 
But, wh en you get older, a
nd this Œ and my self, I thought well, it went through 
everything, let™s forget it. You can™t forg
et. The older you get, the mo re you remind 
yourself what happened, the mo re you wa
nted to cry wh at happened. You have 
more time to think about it, before you 
were busy with your 
work, with business 
and this and this. Now when  it comes you go 
to bed, ev erything comes back to you, 
and especially with me when
 you work  in the mu seum. Wh
en you see all the stories 
and ev erything is your head 
Œ you register everything in
 you Œ in you mind, and it 
comes back to you, everything. A lo t 
of the times I came
 home from work, from 
here, my  wife, uh-oh, uh-oh, you had a toug
h time. She can notice, by the way, that 
I don™t talk of this and this
 and this and this. But yet, 
whenever I come to company, 
I all the time with a smile
, I all the time lighten up 
[indecipherable]
 and I try to do 
my best in life what 
I can. When I am in 
Germany
, and I have a lot of German

friends, they ask me, and th is and this and 
this and this. I says look, the only thing 
you can do about it, what happ
ened, so to see that it doe
sn™t happen again. If you 
see somew h ere the Nazi party and everythi
ng, do something about it. That™s what 
you can help, I said.  
Q: You mentioned that you were
 thinking of wring a book. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Can you briefly tell me a little b
it about your plan for this book? 
A: Well, first of all, I want to talk ab
out my whole family, wh
at everybody in the 
family went through, because it™s a book in
 itself from e Œ every person my  family 
can write a book. And my life at h o me, my
 life in school, which I remember fro m 
the first grade on, the teachers and stude
nts and everything. And during th e war 
what happened, from everybody from mine family wh
at happened during the war. 
And right after the war, how traumatic it was,
 everything. And yet,
 you got to go on 
with your life, and you get situated the best
 you can, and you tr
y to be happy, and 
try to raise a family, and to ha
ve a future, that™s all. And 
that shouldn™t be forgotten, 
that™s the main thing. 

Q: You mentioned that you knew wh
at happened to your parents Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ during the war. Can you go thr
ough your siblings one at a time  Œ

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ and tell me with each one, their fate? 

A: Well, for instance, my parents. I Œ my parents, August 12
th

[indecipherable]
 in our city, that the th-they Œ 
they Œ the Jewish
 community, the 
council, put out notices everybody shou
ld co me, in the best clothes to be 
represented nice, and they come thereto a field which it™s near the Jewish 

community, and they ™re going Œ they™re going 
to register everyone
 for work and this 
and this, to come, and we have to  be on 
time. That™s six o™clock in the mo rning we 
came. We were there six in the morning, 
I won™t go to th e Œ all the history, it™s 
known, but they took aw ay mine parents at 
th at time, and they marched them all the 
way to 
Benzburg
(ph), where they were 
in an orphanag
e for almost three days. I 
didn™t have the keys to the house to get in, so I ran to
 Benzburg
(ph), which the 
police didn™t let me in, the Jewish militia. 
One of them recogniz
ed me and I says, I 
got to get the key. He says, you might be 
Œ not be able get out. I said I™d take the 
chance. And when I came in there, I can ne
ver forget the scene what I saw. People, 
a lot of them had 
taleism,
 how they prayed, an-and th
ey banged themself in the 
heart 
[indecipherable]
. And I will never forget the scen
e that it was, my father gave 
me a watch, he had th e watch, and the ke
ys to the house. And wh at happened, I 
work ed at that time by one of the biggest

for his girlfriend. And a Œ a day before I as
k him what™s going to  be with the parent. 
Oh go, you go th ere 
[indecipherable]
 because I was scared. And then I came on 
with my  older bro Œ why didn
™t Œ you promised me they
 would take my  parents, 
where are they? They 
took him away. Well, I will see 
what I can do. Then two days 
later is where it was to o late, but he didn™t 
tell me where they went or anything. And 
what happened when 
I came out from there, from work, and I went home, I went 
through the fields, never thro
ugh the city. I went through 
the fields, I notice a train. 
And when I look at the train 
I saw German army people in
 the roofs, and this. I see 
through the window 
Yurinis
(ph) 
Snifell
(ph), the father from mine good friend, the 
one that what I told you,
 he died  in Œ in Œ in
 Bergen-Belsen
. He waved to me, I 
waved back . That™s how I knew this 
is the train that they went to 
Auschwitz
. And 
it™s recorded that they
 were killed in the 17
th
 of August, they were killed. And then 
the first victim was my sister
, the one that went on the 
Ex odus
. Sh e was taken away 
in the beginning of ™42, May, wh ere they
 told all young girl
s, women between 14 
and 30 have to register, 14 
or 13 years old. And of course, my  sister was the 
youngest at home, she was only 14 years 
old. And wh at I forgot to  tell you ab out 
my sister, some Œ which it™s interesting i-
in the ghetto what ha
ppened. I will come 
back to this wh Œ 
time will permit me. My sister sa

was the worker™s underground. They were 
more leftists. And when came back all 
the four girls were cut the throats and th
e stomachs. And she was dead and th e kid 
was alive, all bloody from th
e blood. They  didn™t hurt hi
m, but bloody. He grabbed 
the kid, he washed it off, ran away, and in 
Kraków
 he went to a building Œ you 
know the buildings have there staircases
 where you can Œ windows look out? And 
he put the kid near a monastery, on the 
steps from a monastery. He was there for 
about an hour watching window, and he 
saw somebody came out
, a nun, and they 
took the kid away. And he ran 
away. He ran away back to 
Lvov
, to 
Lemberg,
 
where he came from, he was in
 Lemberg
. And what I know about it, what we 
found out, and this is from her husban
d™s brother, what we found out. Her 
husband™s brother was a officer in the Ru
ssian army . And wh en he came back to
 
Lemberg
, when they liberated 
Lvov
, they came from th ere, he found his brother, 
mine sister™s husband and he 
told him the story wh at happ
ened to her, 
and with the 
kid. The same day they were sitting a re
staurant, a drunken Ru
ssian soldier killed 
my  sister™s husband. The day from the lib
eration. So  anyway, he knew about the 
kid, so after the war they put in the pape r they™re looking for 
this kid, and they 
offered a lot of money. In fact, I th ink that the 
HIAS
 or some Jewish organization 
offered a lot of money, a reward for Œ for 
give information ab out that kid that was 
here Œ he had taken aw ay. It took about 
two months, came a telephone, and they let

them know that they
 know about the kid 
[indecipherable]
. They went there, no, 
gave him away already. He went to anot
her place where we gave him Œ he™s on a 
farm. When he came there toward  the fa
rm, he saw a little boy in  the pasture, 
barefoot that the cows, and the little boy starte
d to yell in Polish, help, help, that the 
Jews want to kill me. [speaks Polish he
re] They probably tr
ained that little kid 
against the Jews that they shouldn™t be Œ either suspect he™s Jewish or something, 
they never know. But 
anyway he came in, he wanted 
th e kid, they  wouldn™t give 
him. He says, I give you so  mu ch money. 
No, they don™t have kids. They  held  him 
all during the war and this, it™s his, that th
ey™re not give away. He says, but I want 
to pay fo r every Œ no, no money can do. We 
Œ we love him and everything. Well, he 
saw he didn™t have no Œ anything to do, 
he took a couple Jewi
sh comrades from the 
army, he went back with the 
guns there, and he says, okay,
 either we take him, or 
you gonna get killed when we 
take him. Anyway, they gr
abbed the kid Œ there were 
four sold iers, they grabbed the kid, they
 left money on the table and ran away. 
When  they  ran away they threw aw ay th
eir uniforms, smuggled  themselve over to 
Italy
, and then from 
Italy 
illegal to 
Palestine. 
And my oldest sister that came b ack 
from
 Russia
 when they came to 
Palestine,
 she found out about 
it, she wanted the 
kid because she™s a aunt. Bu
t they went to court in 
Jerusalem
 and they  gave the kid 
to the uncle because he risked
 his life, and Œ and so  anyw
ay, I met a nice Œ he looks
