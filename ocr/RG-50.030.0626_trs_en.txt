Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoca ust
 
Memorial
 
Museum
 interview with Mr. 
Brooks McClure
, on July 7
th
, 2011, here at the co Œ Ce
nter for Advanced Ho lo caust 
Studies, at the m Œ hol -- 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
. And Mr. 
McClure
, thank you very much for 
agreeing to meet with us today. I™m going to start 
the interview as fairy tales do, at the very 
beginning. And that™s goi
ng to  be to ask you 
your Œ when  you were born, the date you we
re born, what was your family like, and 
we™ll take it from there. 

Answer: Well, I was b o rn in Œ on March 8
th
, 1919 in 
New York City
, and lived there 
for the next 20 years of my  life. I never went
 back, really. So I Œ 
my recollections of 
course, are of a nearly ra Œ a disruptiv
e period. We were going th rough the Great 
Depression, and I thought fo r a while I was mo re
 or less exempt from the effects of this 
thing. But my  father was an engineer and he 
got very  sick early in his life, and died at 
53.  

Q: What year was this? 
A: This was 1940. 
Q: So you were
 21 years old? 
A: I was 21, that™s right. 

Q: And had you liv Œ when  you said 
New York City
, were you Œ did 
you grow up in 
Manhattan
, or in the outer boro ughs?

A: I grew up in 
Manhattan
. 
Q: Mm-hm. Had you done Œ attended co
llege? Had you finished high school? 
A: No, that was the thing you see. We 
were relatively well-off, and also terribly 
conservative economically. So
, we had no debt, and neve
r borro wed from anybody fo r 
anything, and the result is that we were rela
tively well off when th
ings went awry. But, 
there was a fund, of course, fo
r the future, for my education 
[indecipherable]
 and that 
suddenly disappeared, b
ecause they knew that 
my father was mortally ill, and we were 
going to  have to take over in some fashi
on, and this is Œ this would be very dis-
disorgan izing, as it was. And so Œ 
Q: Did he Œ excuse me Œ did he 
have his own busin ess, your father? 
A: No, no. 

Q: No. He work ed fo r somebody else. 

A: He worked for the 
New York
 state transportation depart
ment, and his own job had 
to do with train wrecks. When
 Œ when there was an accident
, they had a team th at went 
out and tried to find out wh
y it happened. And he was very
 good at that business, I 
guess, because he went right th
rough from Œ he was a very young man, almost an office 
boy wh en  he arrived, and wo
rk ed his way up. And the thi
ng is, he had no education 
either. He Œ he was born in 
Oh io
, and he went to the good
 schools. I guess you would 
say he was a very ambitious man, and he 
read all the time, and that was a great

influence for me. He had me reading 
Dickens
 and 
Dumas
 when I was nine and 10 
years old, but Œ 
Q: That™s pretty impressive. 
A: Well, if you starting at the right end Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ you know, for instance Œ well, I guess it was 
Robert Louis Stev enson
, it was Œ 
was the start of my  foreign educa
tion, and Œ what was it, the Œ ﬁ
Treasure Island
ﬂ was 
the first book. So, he very carefully chose 
the books to be at a level where I could 
understand, hopefully, and Œ 

Q: Were you his only ch ild? 
A: Pardon me? 
Q: Were you his only ch ild
, or did you have br Œ 
A: No, no, there was a girl after me. 

Q: So you™re the oldest. 
A: Well, I was Œ I was the eldest, yeah. An
d well, at any rate, I Œ I g o t a piece of 
education from reading, and I Œ the reading 
habit I got into, and had occasional troubles 
with my schoolteachers becaus
e they didn™t think that th
e family should race ahead of 
this program, you know. 
Q: Curriculum, yeah.

A: So, at any rate, he was a wonderful old ma
n, and Œ but he Œ he 
got very, very  sick. 
Heart can Œ heart condition, and we knew he wa
sn™t going to be ar
ound a long time, so 
we had to prepare for this. And the prepara
tion did not include an
y possibility of going 
to college. 
Q: I see. 

A: Because not only did we not have enough
 money to cover that, but I knew that with 
a high school education, at that time when jo
bs were very scarce, I didn™t have much of 
a chance. So  Œ but I did have an in terest, 
and the interest was in journalism, which 
actually I developed in the grammar school. An
d befo re I got out of grammar school, I 
had an idea, I Œ I had a Œ I wa Œ a little pl
ay friend, the Œ thes
e correspondences with 
children from other places. 

Q: Oh, pen-pal. 

A: Yeah, one of Œ one of my teache
rs went to, of all places, western 
Australia
, which 
is just Œ just about west of anything in th
e wor Œ in the world. And so I-I got the Œ my 
friend sent me the local paper Œ matter of fact
, all of the local papers. And I noticed that 
one was a weekly, which looked
 more like an American pape
r than  any of the others. 
There was the lingering influence of the Br
itish journalism, with the ads on the page 
one and th at sort of thing. This was 
different, this had he
adlines on page one 
[indecipherable]
 news on page one. And I was really intrigued by this. And I had 
already started my self-education, read ever
y book that had to do with journalism. I

don™t know whether I understood 
it or not, but at any rate, I did that. And Œ and th en 
one day I got the notion that mayb
e these people out in  poor old 
Australia
, would like 
to have a correspondent in the 
United Sta tes
. 
Q: Not a bad notion. 
A: And I noticed that they had 
a regular correspondent in Œ in 
Asia
 who traveled 
around. And then th ey had 
another correspondent in 
Lo ndon
, which was home to the 
Australians. And so these were very special ne
eds. One was, of course, the local aspect, 
of the Œ of news, and the other was 
London
. And Œ but I said th Œ I-I decided to write a 
letter to the editor. So I went
 to the British Œ the Œ I don™t read it any more, but oh, I 

can™t remember the name of it. At any rate, it™s Œ was Œ it™s a Œ it™s a British 
publication, similar, b u t rather more seri
ous than the World Almanac for Œ that we 
have. 
Q: The Economist? Would it be the Economist? 

A: No, no, the Œ 
Q: No? 
A: Œ no, no, no, this i Œ no, no. No , it says Œ 

A2: You mean like 
the encyclopedia. 
A: Sure, it™s got the name of a Œ of a the Œ research publication, but Œ 
Q: I see, okay. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

A: But at any rate, it was the one place wh
ere they had all of 
the editors by name, 
everywhere in the British commonwealth. 
And so I thought, well, in the British 
commonwealth, they speak
 English, and that™s the only 
th ing I can speak, so I wrote 
them a letter and I said, I am a student of
 journalism. No mention of grade, age, 
anything like that. So, I had the Œ and I follo
wed my father™s rules.
 He said, when you 
write a letter, you keep it on one page, if yo
u possibly can, because you lose the reader 
on th e second page. 
Q: Abso lutely right
. Absolutely right. 
A: And so Œ so I followed all the rules, 
and I used the simp lest language, don™t be 
fooled by the multi-syllable wo
rds. So I just said in pl
ain English that I was a Œ a 
journalism student 
[indecipherable]
 without experience as of now, but I noticed their 
paper, and I noticed that they 
had correspondents in these ot
her places, and none in the 
United States
. So would they be interested in
 taking me on, course free, as a 
correspondent. And I thought afterwards, 
what a stupid thing 
to do, you know. I 
consulted no one, and I got Œ I had the shiv
ers afterwards. Then, in the normal turn of 
events, which between the 
United States
 and Œ and 
Australia
 is about two months, I 
got a letter back, and it was from the publis
her, who said, you know, we are Œ we are 
interested in you. We have 
to know a lot more
 about you, but then he said, let™s 
consider it a possibility. And so I did, I 
Œ I found the name of the editor of the 
publication: that was on the masthead of co
urse, And I wrote him and sent him a very

long article about the fa
ilure of the Œ o-o-of 
Roosevelt™s 
policies. Because at that time, 
it were Œ that was about 1937 was it, something like that. 
Q: So you weren™t even  20 
years old? You were like 18. 
A: Oh, oh, I was far from
 20 years old. I Œ I was 
[indecipherable]
 nothing man, I had Œ 
had ab solutely nothing, so Œ so Œ 

Q: But chutzpah. A lot of chutzpah. 

A: Oh, a lot Œ a lot of Œ a lot of gall. 
Q: So, I™d like to turn this 
now to Œ as you™re speaking, a number of thoughts are going 
through my mind. When  I™ve interv iewed ot
her people who were part of liberating 
forces, 
U
.
S
. forces, mo st of them do not have the 
exposure that it so
unds like you did, 
to news, to world events, to 
Œ it Œ to people who were diffe
rent from yourselves. So one 
of the key questions that 
I often ask somebody is, before they even get to 
Euro pe
, did 
you meet anybody who was Jewish. Well, if you live in 
Manhattan
, chances are you 
did. 

A: You couldn™t miss them. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Oh yes, well, that™s a Jewish city, almost. 
Q: And then  my second ques
tion is, is that if you were
 interested in news and 
journalism,  were you aware, even as 
a teenager, of the news coming out of 
Euro pe
, of 
what 
Germany
 was doing? 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

A: Oh, oh certainly. I was ri
ght Œ I Œ I was reading about 
Hitler
, it seemed, when he 
first came u p . 
Q: To power. 
A: 
[indecipherable] 
by Œ what was his name ? A famous, very arrogant guy, who 
seemed to win wars w
ithout thinking about it. 
A2: 
Hindenburg
. 
Q: 
Hindenburg
? 
A2: Talking about 
Hindenburg
, 
v on Hindenburg
. 
Q: 
Von Hindenburg
? 
A2: 
Paul von Hindenburg
. 
Paul von Hinden burg
. 
Q: 
Pa ul von Hindenburg
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: That™s right 
Q: Yes. 
A: And Œ 

A2: The chancellor. 
Q: The chancellor, yeah. 
A: Yeah. And so  I a Œ I was a con Œ conscious of the growth of 
Hitler
. Actually, almost 
everybody was, but I read so 
much. I read internationally 
because I was interested in 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

international affairs, but I was also Œ I-I wa
s taught at home that you Œ you™re a man 
when  you gu Œ when  you™re born , and you 
use your brain from there on. And so it was 
a very good policy. And I had a mixed litera
ry education, in that I Œ there was ﬁ
Tarzan 
of the Apes
,ﬂ which I also read, and the bi Œ the Œ was it the 
Hunter 
boys? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: A-Another series. And so here
 I was reading the classical 20
th
 century Œ or 19
th
 
century literature from 
Europe
, in English, of course, translated, and then th ese other 
books, and enjoying them both. Bu t at a
ny rate, no, I was really up on th e news in 
Euro pe
. There were a lot of other things too, the same time, an awful lot of trouble 
there. 
France
 was having a terrible time. This 
was followed up by the other activities 
that are Œ were very ominous in 
Japan
. They were going after 
Ma nchukuo
 Œ ma Œ
 
Manchuria
. And Œ and in 
Africa 
the Italians were trying to take over Œ 
Q: 
Ethiopia
. 
A: 
Ethiopia
. So, it was a very disturbing time, interestin g time. I can™t say that I was 
scared by it. I was intrigued by it, and th
ere was some very go
od books at the time 
coming out, various comment
ators; professional j
ournalists wrote books. 
Q: Well, 
William Shirer
, I think, was based in 
Berlin
 at the time. 
A: Oh yeah, well I Œ he was a giant in the Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
12
A: Œ in the group. But at any 
rate, there was a great deal of
 concentration on the things 
that counted abroad, and al
so many of the problems at 
home. We had no military 
policy, and we were Œ we were
 terribly weak at the time, 
and that was one of the big 
issues coming up in the 
United States
, how do we protect it? 
Q: So I™d like to turn it back 
to, again, what you talked about earlier in your father, and 
his role in your education. 
And Œ did these Œ these events, 
these world events that you 
are talking about, not only in 
Euro pe
 but elsewhere, but of course for us it™s 
particularly what was going on in 
Europe
; were you discussing these at home? 
A: Oh yes, well, we Œ we, of course, had 
dinner every night in th e dining ro om, and it 
was a conversat-sational sort of sport. So 
we talked about everything, and sometimes 
when I wasn™t old enough to
 know, I got instructed from 
the higher people, my mo ther 
and father. And yeah , 
you know, it was a Œ it was a very
 good way to  get educated, I 
think, without feeling the pain. 
Q: Yeah, it is. It is. To have
 got Œ to have Œ to have c
onversations around the dinner 
table about important events of the day is so
mething th at doesn ™t happen that often any 
more. 

A: There were a lot of people then, commentators on radio. There was one fellow Œ 
what was his name?  
A2: 
Ka ltenb o rn
. 
A: Yeah, 
Kaltenborn
.

A2: 
H Œ H
.
V
. 
Ka ltenbo rn
. 
A: Yeah. He was a Œ and there was also a ma
n who sp oke so fast, w e couldn™t eat. So 
we turned him off. And 
Lowell Thomas
, and you know, a lot of people. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The pretty Œ pretty mu
ch accomplished journalists
. And th e Œ and who could 
expound on a-anything. I think they had a 
little more freedom th
an they do today, 
because there are other people who popped up 
and said, you™re wrong. And so that was 
a very good example of growing 
up in a democratic state. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: It was a Œ it was a fine ex
perience, and a lot of fun. 
Q: So, did you write Œ after th
at first article that you sent
 to the Australian newspaper, 
did you become their 
correspondent? Did you 
end up submitting pieces? 
A: Well, I did, actually I did, but that Œ lo
ng before that, they had that article, w h ich 
was very long. It took a whole bedsheet of pa
per, that they used to
 print on those days, 
and oh, th ey had the 
[indeciphera ble]
 that they Œ usually y
ou find in the Œ in the 
English press, but in the American. Our correspondent in 
New York Œ 
Q: Yeah. That™s right. 
A: Œ
 
tell us
 
what in the world is going on th ere? So
 Œ so I was astonished, because they 
were sort of ta Œ presuming. They didn™t 
know how old I was. I 
know they wanted to 
find the Œ 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

14
Q: They didn™t ask the basic questions. 
A: They weren™t Œ well, they wanted to fi
nd out, but events were mo ving too fast. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And I was, of course, absolutely stunned, 
because I had a plan. As soon as I got that 
rejection, I would write 
to an English paper in 
South Africa
, and see if I could work  on 
them. And there was no Œ there was no compen
sation for this, but every few weeks I™d 
get a very generous check, a hu
ndred dollars, which to  me Œ 
Q: That™s a lot of money. 
A: Œ was a lot of money, to cover my  e
xpenses. Well, my expenses were because I 
traveled by subway, and you 
know, were Œ were very s
lim. And Œ but I Œ I had a 
terrible time because I found that between 
reading about these th
ings and getting an 
idea of how coverage is done, and then ha
ving your pencil in your hand and trying to 

decide, do I do it, or d-d Œ or don™t I? I 
had a couple of disastrous Œ potentially 

disastrous experiences. One was 
Lena  Medina
. 
Lena Medina
 was a five year old girl 
in 
Lima
,
 Peru
 who gave birth to a child Œ at least th
e story, this is what the story said. 
And my  source was I had read it, it was a 
UP
 dispatch. And I knew because I™d gotten 
the Œ a sort of the copy boy™s job at the ﬁ
Herald Tribune
ﬂ at the Œ at that time. I knew 
that the paper always substituted the 
UP  
for 
AP
 or anybody else in 
Latin America
, 
because they felt that it
 was more reliable. So in comes 
this strange story, and I was too 
young to  have the educational experience of
 anything involving women. Women were

there, and what it takes Œ what I assume it 
Œ you know, it assume s th
at. But at any rate 
Œ 

Q: That it™s unusual if they give birth at five. 
A: Œ this was all to Œ very unusual, I t
hought it was Œ I thought instinctively it was 
impossible, because I had never met a
nyone five years old who had a child. 
A2: Reasonable conclusion. 
A: And so I sent in my cable as one of the little stories I h ad from 
America
, this strange 
place where five year olds have 
children. And then
 apparently Œ 
Q: They printed it, I bet. 

A: They Œ they printed it, 
oh wh at they did though, they
 did a very  clever thing. 
Q: What did they do? 

A: They also doubted the veracity of this. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So they called every 
[indecipherable]
 person in 
Perth
, and asked them wh at they 
thought of it, and they 
said, it™s crazy. It can™t be, it™s 
impossible. So  then th ey Œ they 
ran that story together with my  story, in orde
r to take the onus off themselves, in case I 
Œ I™d gone crazy. And Œ but they had, and they
 didn™t know it. And so then there was 
that dead Œ dreadfully 
dead period, nobody wrote me or
 anything saying you shouldn™t 
take these stories seriously. And I had my  
ex planation all done, because I realized, I 
talked to some older people, th-they sa
id, oh, that™s ridi
culous. So then Œ 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
16
Q: Trial and error. 
A: Œ ﬁ
Life
ﬂ magazine was bought by somebody on
 the paper. And this was a Œ oh, 
month or two later, and all Œ 
everything goes very slowly  ou
t there. So Œ and it showed 
a picture of 
Lina Medina
, her surgeon who had per Œ perfo
rmed the operation. It was a 
Œ it was a Œ a Caesarian operation. And Œ and there was the little infant, believe it or 

not, there he was. And Œ and they  got very
 excited about this, so immediately they 
jumped on it. They Œ th
ey reported the existence of the 
photograph, and said they™d Œ or 
they Œ they though
t that they should
 print the fact that this
 was photographed, maybe 
everybody would be interested 
in reading it, or seeing it. 
And they Œ they got really 
very excited. The publisher began going back to
 the Monday lunches that he had sort of 
artfully dodged, after that
 terrible thing. And the Œ 
Q: Does this mean your journalistic
 career was born with that article? 
A: Oh, I don™t know, I had the writing, yo
-you know, I™d been submitting stuff, and 
they™d been printing it, and I got pretty sa
ssy about it. I expected to see the story 
repeated, whatever I said, w ith a byline on it. 
They  put a bylin e every story, even  a 
short one. And no complaint, no instructions
, nothing from them. They  just let me go. I 

had Œ and then in 1941, I sti
ll had this job, and I had th e 
Œ another one of those shocks. 
I was Œ I Œ I had a very  weak Œ weak week
. Poor week for journalism. Nothing was 
developing that I thought I could afford to se
nd. It was 35 cents a na Œ a Œ a word, press 
if I filed. So I was very conscious of this
, par-particularly because of my Scottish ba Œ

background, and I didn™t want to waste the 
paper™s money. So I came to this crisis 
where that weekly cable looked pretty feeb
le. Excu se me. And th ere was a big, big 
event the Wednesday before. This was about
 Friday, I was filing. And th ere was a 
battle at 
Aron
 between the French and the Britis
h. Maybe you rememb er it. I don™t 
know how they 
[indecipherable]
 but this was a pretty exciting story because the 
British and French were allies,
 and they Œ the French had 
been trying to get Admiral 
Darlan
, who was in command of the French forc
es, to Œ to surrender, and the Œ the 
French were very stubborn; 
they wouldn™t surrender. So 
finally the British said, all 
right, if you don™t surrender, we™re going to 
fight you. And they started this battle, a 
really horrible thing because the casualty ra
te was enormous. So me of the biggest ships 
then operating in th e two navi
es, had been sunk, there in 
Algeria
, of all places. 
Q: Is that where the battle was taking place? 

A: Mm. 

Q: In 
Algeria
, okay. 
A: Yeah, that was it. A nd so  I knew all about 
this, of course, and then source reports in 
the general news that so many ships had been
 lost, and so many people had been killed. 
It was a pretty horribl
e outcome. But I thought 
[indecipherable] 
and maybe Œ maybe I 
could sneak it in, and they™d  
realize that I was using old 
news, but I had to. And so, 
oddly enough, they  printed it. Bu
t what they did is they ran 
Œ they went to the archives 
and got the 
Jane™s
 book Œ 
Jane™s
 ships, and copied  out the pictures that were 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

18
mentioned, all of the casualties, an d read it 
down one side of page
 one. And then they 
sent all of Œ the few little words I had to sa
y, I never mentioned anything that I Œ you 
know 
[indecipherable]
 to repeat. But obviously the battle
 had been fought, and I had to 
say something about it. So I did that, and th
at was all printed in eight point type. So 
mu st have been a very impressive thing. I never saw it.  
Q: You never saw that
 piece as it ran? 
A: No, th e paper never came. My Œ every once
 in a while I™d miss a 
copy. So, any rate I 
Œ I was agonized wh en I discovered that 
they printed it, and no other paper in 
Australia 
printed it, of course. And so  th-there was no 
wi Œ no battle and all of its casualties from 
Brooks McClure
. So I wondered how Œ how we got 
around th is, and what happened. 
Well, what happened was that I Œ I always 
made s-small reports, 
as small as I could 
make them, and put each story 
on a different page. And then 
I™d sit in the telegrapher™s 
office and peel them off wa Œ one by one. We
ll, because this was such a bad reporting 

day, I wo rked very hard  and very  late, to get 
the best I could out of it, and so I guess the 
cable came in with this odd st
ory in  the middle, and the rest of it mu ch less important 
stuff. And so  the Australian censor then reco
rd it. What they done
 is they blanked it 
out. And so, on the next Wednesd ay was an announcement that 
Churchill
 is going to  
make a special speech. And so everybody in 
the world was listening 
to that, and they 
heard all about the Battle of 
Aron
, many of them for the first time. S o , at any rate, I 
escaped Œ

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ that time, and I didn™t even  know it. And I thought I was so smart, oh boy. 

[indecipherable] 
to get it. They said th
ey didn™t know what to
 do, they held a Œ and 
editorial conference, and Œ and they were all 
standing around, they 
Œ all the editors, and 
debating this thing. Finally somebody said 
well, look, he™s our ma
n, and we™re Œ we Œ 
we trust him, and it™s all down on paper. I 
think we should stick with it, see what 
happens. And so  everybody more or less agre
ed, that™s what they 
did. And they saved 
themselves a lot of trouble. Well, all ri
ght, I™m sorry. I hope I didn™t digress Œ 
Q: No, no, no, no. 

A: Œ too mu ch. 
Q: It Œ it Œ this is Œ it is all very relevant
, because it brings me to the next poin t. And 
that is, you had mentioned earlie
r that your dad passed away 
in 1940, and that your life 
changed at that time. 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: And I wanted to Œ I wanted to  ask in 
wh ich way it had changed, and how did you Œ 
did you have to leave journa
lism then? Did you have t Œ di
d you make decisions to go 
into the military, were you drafted? I want to
 bring Œ get us to th
e place where you™re 
ending up in 
Europe
, and t Œ and tell me what the sequence of events was.

A: Oh well, I was Œ I was not drafted yet, an d I guess I had a slightly preferential rating, 
because I had al Œ besides my father, who was 
very sick, I had three women to take care 
of in the immediate family. 
Q: And they  were? 
A: So I had Œ may have had a 
[indecipherable]
, but the Œ but I Œ they didn™t draft me, 
and I didn™t volunteer until mu
ch later. But wa Œ events moved very fast. He was a 
stubborn old Scot and he
 Œ he went to wo rk every day.
 He didn™t know he was dying 
and his physician was recommending th at he qu
it, and all that. No, he wanted to  go on, 
do th e job. So it was a terrible strain on ev
erybody who loved him, of course. And I Œ 
what chan ged Œ well, one thing that didn™t 
change was the journalism idea. I had now 
fixed it, because I did this silly thing. And 
I knew that that™s wh
at I wanted to do. 
Regardless, I Œ I went hunting all over 
New York
, all over 
Westchester County
 to try 
to get a job. And of course, they almo st 
laughed. What school did I go to? And I only 
[indecipherable]
 curious creature. I was six -one, 
180 pounds, and in other words, 
always out of line with my peers, and Œ and 
always doing silly thin
gs. So Œ so I Œ I got 
the desserts I Œ I really worked for, and coul
dn™t get a job in Œ on a newspaper. So , we 
had Œ we had to manage Œ cour
se, we had to live on th e re Œ the savings of th e family, 
and it was very hard. I Œ I was out run Œ ru
nning around, trying to  get another job and 
all this, and it was Œ

A: Œ it™s the next thing to the bran Œ

George 
Washington High
, which is down at 
Washington Heights
. So Œ 
Q: I know th e area now. I get a better sense of
 that. I wanted to then  Œ you were looking 
for Œ you were looking for a job.
 Did you eventually find one? 

A: Well, I got a job, oddly, on the Œ on the ﬁ
Herald Trib une
.ﬂ I had been  writing a 
little bit, trying to 
sell some articles in 
America
, too. And I didn™t do spectacularly, but 
I made a few sales. And then th ere was a man named 
Charlie McLenden
(ph), who had 
just taken over as city editor of the ﬁ
Herald Tribune
,ﬂ and I got an interview with him.

And I brought my  clippings, to show him that
 I was doing something. And he said well, 
I™m sorry, we don™t have any 
jobs for Œ for people like you,
 you know, education, all 
those considerations, on Œ on the staff. But he
 said, I Œ I™ll hire you for Œ on the Œ for Œ 
as a copyboy. That was another irrelevancy,
 here I was over six 
feet tall, and running 
copy from one desk to another. 
Sort of an embarrassin g  situa
tion. And so I had that job 
for a long time, they didn™t 
fire me, they kept me on. And they had a reputation for 
those that they Œ that passed 
the test and stayed, of Œ of 
making them reporters after a 
certain length of time. But all these people ha
d, you know, education. So  it didn™t look 
very promising. Bu t I was able to use the pa
per™s facilities, their library, the Œ they had 
an internal telegraph office, where I spen
t a lot of time writing up my stuff. And the 
work  wasn™t hard. The Œ this big goof
 
was running around doing it. And so, at any rate, 
I used it to good advantage, and almost
 gave up. I Œ I was Œ I was then 23. 
Q: Mm-hm, so that™s 1942. 

A: Yeah, that™s right. Well, th
at™s when I joined 
the army , and I Œ my  mo ther and I had 
a ken Œ co nsultation. I asked her what she w
ould think if I went in the army . She said 
she thought it was a very intellig
ent thing to do. After all, th
ere are all kinds of people, 
big sons like you that have to go. Su re they 
have to die, they have
 to suffer, but they™re 
going. And she said that, you™re an  American
, you have to decide wh at to do. So  I 
joined the infantry, which was 
the most idiotic thing to do. 
I™m sure I could have gotten 
a job at a Œ at a better b ranch of the service,
 but Œ but I fel Œ felt very patriotic at the

time, I did the right thing. So
 Œ and then, of course, I had 
to make a lot of changes, I 
had to quit my  job in au s Œ 
Australia
. Wh ich actually was paying off a little bit, you 
know, they were paying me fa
r more than I was worth, and 
I had originally asked just 
to Œ to work for 
nothing, but they wouldn
™t accept that. So, they were very nice. And so 
then off I went in
to the infantry. 
Q: And where were Œ were you stateside for a while? 
A: Pardon me? 
Q: Were you based in  the Œ in th e 
U
.
S
. for a while? 
A: 
United States
? Oh yeah, sure. I™d, of course, did a
ll the basic training and all, which 
is a Œ which is another great exercise. It™s 
very, very hard , you kn
ow, you Œ you have to 
fall on your rifle, and do all sorts of od
d things that normal human beings probably 
wouldn™t. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: But Œ but I got along all right, I got promot
ions. And th en I had a Œ a specialty, I Œ I 
developed a special sk ill 
[indecipherable]
 because I worked at night, and so metimes I 
stayed over, and then the fellow do
wn  Œ we had a wire link between 
New York
 and 
Washin gton
, and th ere was another young fellow th
ere, just in my  same position. And 
we would send long messages to each other. An
d I Œ I got so that I could type 60 word s 
a minute. 

Q: Wow. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

24
A: And then Œ that™s the speed
 of the transmitter distribut
or that does it automatically, 
you know. And so, when I got in th e army , I 
did another foolish thing. They  said, put 
down  anything you think y-you mi
ght be ab le to do in  the service, if you have a special 
Œ 
Q: Skill, mm-hm. 

A: Œ skill. So I thought about th at a little bit.
 I thought the only th ing I knew how to  do 
was to type. So Œ so  I told him that I coul
d Œ I Œ I could imitate the speed of a Œ an 
electric transmitter on the typewriter. Well that
™s Œ really that wasn™t such a Œ an 
achievement. There are millions of girl
s with typewriters who could do th at. 
Q: But they™re not in the army. 
A: No, th at™s right. And they didn™t get the opp
ortunity to do this. 
So  somebody had run 
the 
IBM
 rod you know, through the bo Œ throug
h the cards, and came out with this 
remarkable fact that one of th
eir soldiers Œ actually, I had 
Œ I had this experien ce with 
computer Œ with transmitters that, 
you know Œ computer
 transmission. 
A2: The teletypes. 
Q: The teletypes probably. 

A2: The teletypes. 
A: Yeah. 
A2: The teletypes? 

Q: Was it the teletypes? 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
25
A: Yeah, teletypes, yeah.  
Q: That™s right, mm-hm. 

A: So, well, then I didn™t know this, but th
e Œ the army  decided in the earlier period, 
when  they  weren™t so overw he
lmed, that they would experiment with a Œ a wireless. 
Well, wirel ess was an unknow
n then, for teletypes, although it™s Œ today it™s e-
everywhere. And so they Œ they transferred 
me. I think I was a Œ I was probably just a 
PFC
 at the time. And Œ 
Q: Private first class? 

A: Huh? 

Q: Private first class? 
A: Private first class. A nd all of a sudden I 
found that I was still 
in the infantry, but I 
had this special assignment. They had te
letype machines, and 
you could practice on 
them, and I practiced on them, and somebody el
se did too. And one of Œ two of Œ two 
other men were taken in for this, but th
ey  were both noncoms. One was a master 
sergeant and the other ta Œ the next le-level. 
And so Œ but they came out of the Œ out of 
the signals busin ess, they wo rked  for railroa
ds, you know, all sorts of things. So  they 
had plenty of experience. Th
ey knew all about how Œ how 
these things wo rk ed. I didn™t 
know, I couldn™t repair one. I wa Œ I wasn™t
 going to tell them I wasn™t qualified. I was 
secretly pleased that the Œ well, I guess I alre
ady had a grade. I was probably  a corporal 
or a sergeant by that time. And I™ll tell you,
 when  you think and wh at you do in the

infantry, how you will get home to
 mama is a question. So Œ 
so I the Œ I Œ I decided I™d 
do what the wa Œ army  wanted
 me to do. And so I had th
is curious job all through Œ 
actually variations in my career, I joined the air force, and I Œ I Œ I qualified, and I was 
very keen 
about that. 
Q: Was this post-war? 
A: Huh? 

Q: Joining the air force was post-war, or during the war? 
A: No, this was during the height of the cas
ualties in Œ in the eighth army, you know, in 
the Œ in Œ in 
Europe
. And of co urse, we weren™t doing too well the Œ 
Asia
 either, but Œ 
but it was a Œ it was a death wish, actually, if
 you got into that. And I Œ I was willing to 
go, but when I had any kind 
of alternative, I Œ I was willing to accept it. Then a Œ 
Q: Because the in Œ can I just Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ clarify? Because being in the infa
ntry would have been
 the worst possible 
situation. Is that Œ i-if I unde
rstand this properly? It was Œ 
A: Well Œ 

Q: Œ not the Œ the least of Œ le-let me see if 
I can rephrase that. Is it
 if you want to get 
home to mama, being in the infantry is going 
to be the place where it™s least lik ely to 
happen? 

A: Oh, wi Œ yes, I would say so. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
27
Q: Okay . Okay. 
A: Although the Œ although I discovered after I 
got in the air force, that the casualty rate 
was just as great. They shoot 
you out of the sky, 
and Œ instead. So the question Œ I Œ I Œ 
I wasn™t doing too good at artful dodging, rea
lly. But at any rate, things were all right. I 
was just getting around, and then  finally wi
nd Œ wound up back in
 the infantry when 
Eisenhower
 declared that they had too many flie
rs, and Œ and that they were going to 
pair Œ send all the fliers and 
[indecipherable]
 specialists, and all the special kinds of 
people back to the infantry. 
So me of them had never been in the infantry wh en  they 
were put in. If you ev er heard of th e Battle of the Bulg e Œ 

Q: Oh yes. 
A: Œ there was a Œ there wa
s a tremendous of them 
[indecipherable]
 to that. And to go 
in to a Œ to a war like that, 
that was murder. And Œ but I di
dn™t Œ I was sent down to a 
regular infantry division th
at was only training. I-I Œ  
Q: What year was this? 

A: Oh, let™s see. Oh, this 
was late ™43 or early ™44. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And I Œ and I joined this infant
ry unit, one of the last to go to 
Europe
, actually, and 
oddly enough, yo
u know, was a late arrival, I was put into 
Patton™s Third Army
, 
which had one of the dreadful in fa
ntry scores Œ casualty scores. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

28
Q: Mm-hm. So you arrived in 
Euro pe
 Œ I want to establish th
is fact: you arrived in 
Euro pe
 when? In early ™44? 
A: Let me see. Must have been. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And we were the last division to  arrive,so we were sort of a Œ a poor gift to the 

army that got it. But we trained very hard
, and I had had a little train ing before, so I 

felt, they can train me to death if they want
 to, because I want to be equal to the job 
when I get it. So Œ but in th
e meantime there was this type
writer business. Now, if you 
can imagine, they had, 
while we were in the 
States
, they had the typewriter equipment, 
and they  had this special articulated truck,
 one of those things that swings in all 
directions, you know, to Œ to 
transport it. And I was tra Œ I 
was trained in how to park 
this thing, and you know, to ru
n it, in case they need ed me. But Œ but they had a regular 

team of transport people who Œ who normally 
handled this job. Well, I went into the 
field in 
Mississippi
, and did all these things, and that™s 
the last I saw of the truck or the 
Œ or the computers, the Œ 

Q: The wireless telety pers? 

A: The tele Œ wireless teletype. And they didn
™t Œ course they don™t Œ didn™t consult me 
in the service on anything, really, but I didn™t 
know what ha Œ wh at happened  to  it, but 
they had forgotten to cancel it or change it in
 some way. So there was always this little 
strange thing, that I went abroad, I was Œ 
I was posted in the signal comp any of the 65

infantry division, and got 
assignments occasionally, but 
it was not a Œ not terribly a 
busy job for me. A division is about 14,000 me
n, so you can see they had a lot Œ lot of 
people that do th eir normal work. And Œ a
nd I never was pressed 
too mu ch, because I 
had this secret job. Nobody ever talked about 
it, it was just Œ I was just out in the cold, I 
guess. I got a couple of promotions. 
Q: Well, what did you do? This is wa Œ so
mething I don™t unders
tand: wh en you were 
in the infantry, what was it that
 you were doing over there in 
Europe
? 
A: Well, I was Œ I was attached to this supe
r-secret mission.So, I 
don™t know, that was 
enough for me. But I was in Œ getting in a few Œ few firefights, but nothing Œ 

Q: So you didn™t really see battle? 
A: Huh? 
Q: You didn™t see battle? 

A: Well, sure I f-fought. I was shot and Œ s
hot at and I shot back, and no, I had enough 
experience so I could say I was an infantryma
n, but Œ but there I was encased in this 
situation, and th ey Œ 

Q: Well, what can you tell us Œ what can you te
ll us about this su Œ this secret mission? 
What was its goal, what was its p u rpose, what was Œ 
A: Well, the thing was, they wanted to de
velop a wireless system, which would connect 
the Œ the frontline troops with 
headquarters, and Œ in-insta
ntly. And you can do it with

teletype, but you can™t do it if 
you have to have lines betwee
n teletypes being cut by the 
enemy all the time. 
Q: Right. Right. 
A: And just laying th e lines is too hideous 
a job. But this was obviously the beginning 
of a project that we were trying to analyze a
ll the aspects, and see if they can straighten 
it out. I Œ I could understand, but I never Œ 
never thought it was ter ribly funny, but I 
happen to be the beneficiary, so I wasn™t
 going to argue about it. Well, as a resu lt 
though, I had a distorted military caree
r, in which Œ during which I had the two 
experiences that we Œ we were to talk about. 
Q: And that we™re Œ I™m hoping, yeah, that we 
can now. So di Œ does th
is Œ the fact that 
you were in this Œ in this particular Œ I do
n™t know if the right wo rd is occupation or 
activity, is that what bro
ught you closer to Œ wh en 
we™re going to talk about 
Ohrd ruf
, 
that Œ why you happened to be
 there at Œ at th at time. 
A: Well, you know, it™s only because I 
got into this peculiar subculture Œ 
Q: I see. 
A: Œ in the military. There were other peop
le in the army, some
 fascinating people. 
There Œ you can™t imagine 
how some noncommi ssioned officers got positions of 
enormous authority, and it™s because of that, in 
this instance, that I 
got into one of these 
things. The one about the Œ th
e wor Œ the wo rk projects of the Œ to so many of the 
Holocaust victims. And so from there on I was

have to go Œ di Œ wasn™t calla
ble and ba Œ an d part of the 
[indecipherable]
 and really 
just give it Œ I had a lot of free time. A
nd that was the real trouble. Free time and 
McClure
 don™t go together. So I went out, 
had some adventures. I was actually 
AWOL
, I guess a ti Œ absent without leave. 
Q: Where? 
A: And Œ but nobody missed me, and Œ 

Q: Were you in 
Germany
? 
A: Œ I answered all the Œ you know, you ge
t up in the morning, 
they blow the bugle, 
they get you out, they
 Œ they ch eck your name to make 
sure you™re there. Then  you go 
to breakfast, and then, of course, 
McClure
 vanishes.  
Q: Where did you vanish? 

A: My wer Œ might work on a keyboard , but 
he™s not doing anything mo st infantry men 
would respect. So, at any rate, the way I Œ I at
 some time will get to
 the Œ to these two 
things, two very different expe
riences, quite profound. And Œ 
Q: In all of this, you say you arrived in 1944,
 early in 1944, and probably  it™s a year and 
some months later, ma ybe a year and th
ree months later when  you come onto 
Ohrdru f
. 
In that time , did you know, was it spoken
 of, was it known ab out, of what was 
happening basically to the Jews and others in 
Europe
? Was it Œ was Œ were you aw are, 
were others aware?

Q: Well, that™s an interesti
ng question because as an indivi
dual, I don™t rememb er being 
terribly well-informed about Œ we
ll, once Œ once they open ed 
Auschwitz
, all rig h t. But 
before that Œ well, I was aware of the 
Sa int Lo uis 
incident. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And the criticism of 
Roosevelt
 because he didn™t save t
hose people, keep them from 
going back and dying, like they did. 

Q: Yes, absolutely. 
A: And so I Œ I was aware of that, and of 
course I knew that the German propag anda 
was all anti-Jewish. But this business of gath
ering up people just to
 kill them, I didn™t Œ 
wasn™t aware of being aware of that. And in
 fact, when I Œ wh en Œ wh en we discovered 
that the work quarters of 
these poor people in south 
Germany
, first time we had 
encountered  it Œ apparently, I don™t know 
how they got away with out being caught, 
becau Œ of course, 
Germany
 is a very big country . 
Q: Yes. 

A: And Œ and we went 
after the cities first. 
Q: So tell us about Œ you say th e first 
time you enco untered this was in south 
Germany
? So was that like 
Bavaria
? In 
Ba va ria
 is Œ 
A: No, no, I Œ it™s th

 was. 
Q: Oh no, no, then 
we™re going the other direction, then it™s 
Thüringen
. Then Œ was 
Ohrdru f
 the first time you came into contact
 with what this policy had been?

everybody. Nobody Œ 
Q: Can you Œ now can we go 
into some detail 
about this? You were

 was your job? Wh at
 were you doing when  
you were called to go to 
Ohrd ruf
? What was y Œ wh at were you in volved  in? 
A: Oh yeah, well, that™s the Œ 
the Œ the thing here, I referred 
to about th-the sub-class in 
the army. 

Q: Right. Right. 

A: Some awfully smart people of very low ra
nk got in, and it™s amazing. He was in the

good work. He made sure
 everybody got decorations
 who were supposed  to. 
Q: Who was this person? 

A: A young man from 
Chicago
, ju Œ was just a name to me
. I got to know him, but he 
wa Œ he worked on th e ﬁ
Chicago Tribune
,ﬂ and had Œ that 
was a fascinating Œ 
something that I didn™t know. Because, I guess 
he had good talent, he was taught to do 
all the main  jobs on the paper. So that the Œ if
 the Œ if the printers went out on strike, he

would go down  and wo rk a linotype machine.
 So, at any rate, he was a Œ a pretty Œ 
pretty savvy young guy, and had 
been kicked around 
a little bit, so he Œ he knew how to 
Œ how to  handle problems. And Œ and he had 
a boss, a Œ I don™t know, a colonel, or a 
lieutenant colonel who was very en amored of 
him for a while; this is a smart b oy. And 
so he grad ually elevated in authority. He was given 
[indecipherable]
 of things to do, th 
Œ his boss wanted resu lts, and he was a results getter. And so , at any rate, by the time I 
ga Œ I got to know him pretty well, because of
 my  interest in journalism, I found he had 
been with the ﬁ
Chicago Tribune
,ﬂ which was not the 
New Yo rk Tribune Œ  
ﬁ
Herald 
Tribune
.ﬂ 
Q: Right. 
A: But Œ but we had a simila
r interest, and we joked about
 Œ about journalism, and so  
on. And so it got so, for little th
ings. I was mostly idle, in a
nother part of the camp. The 
Œ the camp is a city, really. And he™d call on me
 if he ever had something th at Œ a job to  
do, that he couldn™t do or Œ so Œ so we go
t pretty chummy . Then  one day a Œ one day a 
Jeep
 showed up first thing in 
the morning. I Œ I was just 
finishing breakfast, I guess, 
and I was being called by my  friend. So  I got in  the 
Jeep
, and off we went, over to his 
headquarters, and he told me we Œ we™ve di
scovered some anomaly here, strange thing, 
a lot of people dying and I don™t know, we ju
st got a radio report on this thing at Œ I 
need this Œ h-he Œ he describe
d it. Well, he said he Œ he wa
nted to send me over there to 
take a picture of this thing. He said we shoul
d have pictures of it. 
So he gave me a no Œ

a German 35 millimeter camera, one
 of the best that they ma
ke. And Œ but it had film in 
it, I didn™t know the speed of
 the film, and that was a big handicap because I knew I 
couldn™t take many pictures in the shadow, if 
Œ if Œ if that was stan dard film. So, off I 
went, and they had a driver, really  quite incr
edible. He had surveyed
 the route to this 
place by Œ by using a Œ automobi
le company maps. And so we went right there, it was 
no problem, he made no mistakes, he drove ri
ght there. And we got into the area, we 
didn™t know where the camp was, but we sa
w all of the military equipment that had 
been gathering. 
Q: So, by the military e
quipment, do you mean 
U
.
S
.
 
military? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . And how long, you know, from wher
e your unit was to where this camp  was, 
was it a half hour drive, was it an 
hour driv e, do you rememb er? Was it Œ 
A: It was Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ as I Œ I feel it now,
 it seemed to be about 
half an hour, 45 minutes. 
Though I Œ I could be wrong ab out that. 
Q: Yeah. But anyway, it wasn™t half a day. It
 wasn™t something that was very far away. 
A: Oh, no. 
Q: Okay . 
A: We didn™t have to eat or anything. 
Q: Okay . Okay.

A: So, well, I came upon this 
rugged terrain. We got off th
e main drive. He wa Œ he 
was absolutely sure of where he would find
 it, and he came Œ he came into an area 
where we saw a lot of Œ a couple of tanks
, and a lot of other mo torized equipment, 
American, and we figured we™d
 Œ we™d hit something. And 
th en we were Œ were led by 
the locals, wha-whatever 
G
.
I
.
s 
we could find, and led to this place. Well, it w as very 
remote in the woods, and the 
little building, all of raw wood
. And they had a huge gate, 
with a slogan, let™s see if I can remember. 
It™s a very simp le slogan in German, and 
[indecipherable]
 although most people had to deal with it. 
Arbeit Œ 
something about 
arbeit
 that Œ well, work is a liberator, or Œ 
Q: 
Arbeit macht frei
. 
A: Yeah, that 
macht frei
, that™s right. 
Q: 
Arbeit macht frei
. 
A: 
Arbeit macht frei
. And there was this Œ that™s th
e only metal I could remember, 
everything else was ju st wood. 
And I learned also later that
 they built hundreds of these 
on th e same plans, so that if you encounte
red one in one place, it looked like the same 
you saw before. And Œ 

Q: So, was like a wooden building? Did it 
look like a storehouse, or a warehouse? 
A: No, no, it didn™t have any 
distinction or appearance of
 authority or anything like 
that. It was just a little Œ I 
want to say, a crudely built 
architecturally nil kind of

construction. And it Œ it was designed fo r its
 purpose, which it was just to house the 
Holocaust victims. 
Q: So, did you open the Œ di
d you open a door to it? 
A: Oh, I didn™t do an ything. I arrived, I was just another 
G
.
I
. I Œ well, I was mo re than 
that, I was a Œ I think I was a serg eant by then
, but I was just another guy dressed in all 
the same clothes that everybody else was, 
an d I liked that because nobody asked any 
questions. I wasn™t part of the rescue team
 though, and I had free access, I could go 
around, take pictures wherever I wanted. I Œ 

Q: What™s the first picture you took? 

A: First picture I took was of the Œ of the 
grave. There was about, oh, I would say about 
800 feet long, very lo
ng, and very deep , and about 15 feet wide. 
Q: And what did you see in it? 

A: Hm? 

Q: What did you see? 
A: Well, bodies. In fact, I Œ I had no tr
ouble understanding wh at it was for, because 
they were in  the process of dumping mo re bo
dies in, all of them naked. They  take Œ 
they took off the rags that 
they had been  wearing, washed
 them, and then
 they™d use 
them again, you see. But th Œ 

Q: So when you came aco Œ across this first 
scene that you to ok a photograph of, there 
was actual dumping of bodies going on in the Œ

A: Yes, oh yeah, sure. 
Q: Was this now the 
U
.
S
. military that was cleaning it out?  
A: Oh, th ere were. There was a lot of work
 to do, because there were many bodies in 
this Œ in the barracks. Barracks were three Œ three stages high, as 
I r e memb er, a n d  th ey  
were just lay Œ laid out on the floor of th Œ 
each level. And so me of them were so weak, 
they couldn™t get up to eat. 

Q: So, when you were in th
e barracks there were people wh
o were alive, as well as 
people who were dead. 

A: Oh yeah, well, they 
were dying. That™s what they were doing, it was Œ 
Q: Was this men or women? 
A: All Œ all Œ all Œ both. 
Q: Both  men Œ any ch ildren? 

A: No, I didn™t notice any ch ildren. I think they
 disposed of the children very quickly. I 
know Œ 
Q: When you say Œ excuse me that I™m in
terrupting Œ wh en you 
say three stages, do 
you mean that there were Œ the bunks were in three bunks Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ and that people were on each level? 
A: Three tiers. 

Q: Yeah, okay. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

39
A: Yeah. Now, of course, the 
stronger ones so happened to be
 on the top, because they 
could still get down, but Œ but there were a lot 
of them even in the 
Œ on the lowest level, 
who were just comatose. Ju-Just a terr Œ 
it™s a terrible sight. These are people who 
should be dead, but
 were alive.  
Q: Did you take pictures there too? 
A: Pardon me? 

Q: Did you take pictures of them? 
A: Couldn™t, because I wasn™t sure of the Œ of the film. 
Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. I figured it was not a ver Œ a super 
speed, that™s what you
 need for that, in 
order Œ 

Q: Because it would be inside, and darker, yeah. 

A: Your light, there™s Œ there™s almost no lig
ht in there. So I didn™t Œ I took some 
pictures, but they didn™t come out. 
Q: Mm-hm. And do you have an idea of ab
out how many bodies you saw, or how many 
people you saw in there? Was it stuffed to 
the gills? Was it a hundred, 200? Was it 50? 
I know those are abstra Œ you know, sort of estimates, but Œ 

A: Yeah, hard to tell. 
Q: Œ to get a sense of a Œ 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
40
A: Hard to tell how many there were. I went in
, I took a look, I saw some of them, and I 
came out. 
Q: Did any move to you? Did an
ybody want to talk to you? 
A: Oh yes, well, not Œ not 
Œ I mean, they didn™t campai
gn, but you could see they™d  
look at you with those empty eyes, and beg you,
 really, to help. But 
th Œ they were very 
pleased, they were Œ by Œ by the time I got
 there, the operational troops had called for 
help, and they got some Œ some very skilled 
medical people, by the way. They couldn™t 
do mu ch  for the ones that were dying, of c
ourse, but they were dying, and they  had to 

be disposed of, because it was a v ery grea
t danger, biological danger. So, when I got 
there, I Œ the one thing I 
reme mb er, the one, looked like pretty husky guy, a man, 
maybe in his middle 30s, something like th
at, carrying a skeleton.
 Dang Œ skeleton was 
just dangling there. And then
 Œ then tossed it into the 
trap, you know, into the Œ 
Q: By trap, do you mean that 800 foot long Œ 

A: Yeah, di Œ 
Q: Œ ditch th at Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It was the grave. 
A: Yes, it™s a Œ and somebody, they put in 
lime. And I saw this, and I think that was 
early enough so that Œ it 
isn™t the way it necessarily looked at the end. But Œ 
Q: So this is before th
e lime starts taking effect? 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
41
A: Hm? 
Q: This is before the lime starts d o ing what it does? 

A: Yes, that™s right, it wasn™t Œ th-there
 Œ there was some lime underneath. Th-T his Œ 
the depth of this, human depth was maybe three 
or four feet already, so a lot of bodies 
underneath that al Œ already b
een disposed of, and I don™t kn
ow how long that gash had 
been there. I suspect 
that it was th ere be Œ before the 
guards left. They Œ they got a 
warning that the Americans were coming. 
Q: Can Œ do you have a sense of how lo ng the 
U
.
S
. military was already there before 
you arrived? 
A: Well, not to my Œ it wasn™t too long. 
Q: A day? 
A: A Œ no, no, not a day. Th
ey Œ the tank came on it Œ what was that hour, I don™t 
know. It could Œ I think it was a man who became General 
Abrams
, who was the 
commander of the tank. He was then a captai
n, or something. And th en he had other 
trucks, cars with him, with troops. Let™s see. 
I think it was fairly late in the day when he 
came on, or possibly even later. 

Q: In the ev ening, maybe. 
A: Yeah, right. And he immediately re Œ radi
oed back to headquarters, and Œ and they 
of course notified the division command. An
d that™s the way I got the word myself,

very first thing in the morning. We Œ so they  mu st have been th ere, couldn™t have been  
doing very mu ch, because of the darkness. 

Q: Right. 
A: And I suppose they were Œ they mu st have been susp icious too. A lot of serious 
trouble going on one place, you know, and th 
Œ and after dark, you don™t dare endanger 
yourself. But at any rate they Œ they notifie
d us. They  used their own medics in the Œ 
the little group that arrived. 
Q: Do you remember the date? 
A: Hm?

. We™re on 
a separate track, that™s why we™re go Œ so
, I was asking you ab out the date. Do you 
have an idea about when this was? 
A: Oh, I didn™t keep track of dates. I Œ I could be a week  off Œ 

Q: It™s okay. 
A: Œ at any time. 
Q: But it was April. 

A: Hm? 
Q: It was April, you think. 
A: I th Œ I seem to remember that it was Ap
ril. I was looking Œ incidentally, I didn™t 
mention this, but I had a few notes, and I had 
some of the pictures that I took, in my  
files. And my  wife died, and I got sick, and 
so I didn™t follow up 
very much on this. 
Had to sell the house and Œ and move into  an
 old people™s home. So, I Œ I Œ I wasn™t 
aware of this very much, but 
unfortunately a lot of the file
s that I preev Œ prized, were 
lost. And so I would have had th e date, and a Œ 
a lot Œ lot of other things in there. I Œ I 
can™t imagine my  not noting th at down , beca
use this was such an unusual experience. 
Q: Yes. 

A: But Œ

A: Huh? 

Q: Was it cold still if you Œ 
A: Oh, it was always dank. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Sort of chilly, you know. 
I do Œ there was certainly in
 the air, and it was in Œ I 
suppose even in Œ it might have been
 in spring, you know, the weather. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But I was wearing a re-regular uniform, no 
coat or anything. So I Œ I don™t know. It 
couldn™t have been very  cold. But 
those poor people, oh my heavens. 
Q: Did anybody try to speak 
with you from those Œ from Œ 
A: Yes. Usually in a langua
ge I didn™t understand. A lo t 
of them were Poles, ge Œ 
Germans, Russians. 
Q: Mm-hm. So you think you sa Œ maybe ther
e were Soviet soldiers who were in the 
group, too? 

A: Oh, it™s quite possible. The Germans we
re not very  respectful of the Œ of the 
Russians Œ 
Q: No.

ally the extent of my experience.

 How long did you stay
 wi Œ in this one 
place? 
A: Not Œ not very lo ng. 
Q: No? 
A: We were Œ we were on the move. The Œ 
the Œ the army as itself, was moving very 
fast. And that™s why I think they Œ they over
took some people that were trying to get 
away. And 
Patton
 moved at times, 50 miles in a day. No w, if you can imagine a 
military force of maybe clo-close to a half a million men Œ 

Q: That™s a lot. 

A: Œ moving this fast, and actually, if yo
u read up on it, it™s quite interesting in 
retrospect, to see how well the Americans di
d. They fought like fiends. The Germans

Q: Œ the guards from the camp. Could you tell us something Œ 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
47
A: It would be a shame not to talk about th
at. The Œ the camp  had th Œ been  warn ed by 
wireless, and immediately started to disband. 
And ul Œ a lot of the Œ th e guards seemed 
to have ro oms or some thin
g down in the town of 
Oh rd ru f
, 
o-h-r-d-r-u-f
, as I 
reme mb er the spelling. And some of them da
shed down  and ch anged their clothes, and 
just mingled with the local people. And s Œ 
but very soon the Amer icans realized what 
had happened, and th ey  sent a tank down  a
nd they put them on th
e tank, brought them 
back Œ the ones they  could find. They  fu 
Œ found quite a number apparently. This all 
happened before I arrived.  

Q: So very quick ly. 

A: Yeah, oh, y
eah, so was Œ 
Q: Very quickly. 

A: Œ no delay. I thought the military did 
a wonderful job. They
 didn™t pause for a 
minute. And they brought them back dressed in their 
[indecipherable]
 uniforms, and Œ 
and civilian clothes. And this town, by the 
way, is a lovely little paradise, beautifully 
kept. They all had flower Œ window flower
 arrangements. And Œ and it was really a 
wonderful place to goto. They had the 
[indecipherable]
 and then the Œ all the 

arrangements. And so Œ and they  had a fu
ll population town, I gu
ess, mostly middle 
aged people, women and men. But Œ 

Q: About how far was th
e campsite from the town? 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
48
A: I™d say about two miles now, my  guess 
Œ my  guess is. I don™t 
know how you Œ one 
measures d istance when you™re walking Œ 
Q: Did you walk it? 
A: Œ especially when  you™re a young man. 
Q: Did you walk it? 

A: Oh, I walked it, sure. 

Q: About how lo ng did it take you 
to get from the town to the camp? 
A: I don™t know. And I don™t know why I walked it, because we had a car. But Œ but I 

don™t Œ I don™t know, I went down Œ maybe 
I™m a Œ had comp any. I can™t reme mb er 
now. 
Q: It™s okay. 
A: But, at any rate, I got down there, a
nd I remember en tering the town from one end, 
and seeing how beau tiful it was, and how fie
ndish  the whole idea seemed to be. At a-
any rate Œ 
Q: The guards Œ excuse me that I™m interr
upting, but we go back to  the guards. They  
were brought back in civilian clothes to 
the camp. Did anybody recognize them and 
identify them, from the Œ from those dying people? 

A: Oh yes, well, that™s what I was about 
to say. There were so
me of the Holocaust 
victims who were at least strong enough to  
stand up and move arou
nd. And when the Œ 
when the Americans bro ught these people in, I heard, and I Œ and thi-this is not my 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

49
personal experience, but they attacked th
em. And at first the Americans had to 
intervene, and stop it and so  forth. And Œ but 
that didn™t appease the Œ the victims at all, 
of course. The Œ but all of this is hearsay.
 I wa Œ I Œ I heard this when I Œ when a Œ 
when we arrived. 
Q: Another question. Maybe my  final one that has to do with 
Ohrdruf
, unless 
Joe 
has 
some mo re, is when peop Œ wh
en the Americans came, th e 
G
.
I
.
s Œ
 no, I have two mo re. 
When theAmericans came, and 
they saw this, did they have any idea of what it was 
that they were seeing? 

A: No. No. Of course, the first thi
ng you see is the dead and dying. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And these were obviously not people arme
d, so they weren™t so
ldiers in the normal 
sense. And they were all dressed in thes
e curious unifo rms, with the stripes going 
down , you know. And so they 
Œ they were Œ mu st have b
een aware that these were 
prisoners who had re
volted, or something. I-It was hard to piece together a story, even 
when  I was there. And the next day, a pa
ssel of Œ of generals came to see it. 
Q: Well, that™s my second question. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Does the name 
Franks
 say anything to  you? 
Franks
, as a last name. 
A: French? 
Q: 
Franks
. 
Frank
, with an 
S
 at the end. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

A: Like Œ like the country? 
Q: No, no, not like the coun
try, like the hamber Œ no, 
like the hot dog. A frank. 
A: Oh, the franks. 
Q: Yeah, does the name 
Franks
 say anything to  you? 
A: No, no, I di Œ I never met a 
Frank
 knowingly. 
Q: Okay. Because I had heard that there wa
s Œ this was a person who was responsible 
for getting some of the hi
gher-ups to come to 
Ohrdru f
 and 
Buch enwald
. 
A: Oh, well, I may have. I ma Œ oh, no, 
Buchenwald
 is something else again. This is an 
entirely separate and belated development. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So no, the next day they got 
Patton
,
 Bradley
, I think Œ what™s that? Field Marshall 
Montgomery
, and th en  a couple of others, beca
use they found that it was something 
very unusual. Actually, how 
it escaped their notice so long, I don™t know, because our 
patrols extended far in. But I suppose er Œ if 
it had been  er Œ discovered ear-earlier, it 

would have been a little bit Œ bit of a situ
ation. For one thing, maybe the response, 
because of the time of day, 
would have been quicker. They
 Œ they rea Œ they Œ they 
recognized Œ the medics that 
they had were just regular co
mbat medics, and they knew 
they couldn™t do a great deal. All they did 
was recognize the principle that after a 
certain point of not eating, you are doomed. 

Q: Right. Yeah.  

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
51
A: And Œ and th ere were a lot 
of doomed people around ther
e. Oh, it was really awful. 
And, you know Œ well, you™ve all seen pict
ures of these people; 
they™re so thin, it™s 
unbelievable. Their veins stood out
 on their arms and everything. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 didn™t seem human. And I wonder 
how th ey got along. There was 
a good mixture of languages, but you™d have
 to organize it among the survivors, a few 
could speak English or French. Otherwise, 
they were out of communication, really, I 
think. Maybe some of the Germans mi
xed in would have 
been re-reasonable 
Q: How long did you stay there? 

A: Pardon me? 
Q: How long did you stay there? 
A: Oh, I didn™t stay very long at all. Took 
my pictures. I knew they  wanted th em back 

at headquarters, and so I Œ I just abou
t jumped in the ca
r, and off we went. 
Q: So were you there a couple ho
urs, perhaps, or half a day? 
A: Yeah, yeah. Not very 
much at all. I realized early on
 that I couldn™t spend much time 
in Œ inside th ese buildings.  

Q: Mm-hm. So it was mo
re than one build ing? 
A: Oh well, I think so. I th
ink th ere was. I only went into one, but it was a Œ it was a 
pretty sizable thing. I don™
t know how many work ers they 
had to have, or they  were 
using for whatever project they were doing. 
They  were Œ they we

out the Œ the – the woods, you know, beca
use the Germans do th at. They  make it a 
policy, clean out the underbru
sh  wherever they are, an
d they use it, of course, 
profitably, to burn. But Œ and I wouldn™t ha
ve been Œ I don™t know wh ere the Œ how Œ I 
don™t know how Œ how the civilians 
managed. They Œ the tradition in 
Germany
 is to go 
into the woods and clean it out. Well, you know, 
if Œ if the Œ if the camp  was two miles 
away, I don™t know how they w
ould escape being discovered, 
but I don™t think that™s an 
issue. These Œ the Œ the townsp eople all knew about this. I understand that afterwards, 
the Americans took the 
Bürgermeister
 and a number of senior civilian officers up to 
watch this process that I watched; 
they were still burying these people. 
Q: Did you ever write ab
out this after the war? 
A: Huh? 

Q: Did you ever write about this? 

A: No, I never did. I never did. Bu t I Œ bu
t I Œ I think that after the war it was well 
known, and wasn™t quite as dramatic as hanging th em with piano wire in 
Auschwitz
. 
But the Œ the whole thing is unbelievable,
 mo re-so Œ you know, one says that it™s 
unbelievable that a group of people would be killed this wa
y, for nothing other than 
being what they are. And that binary nature
 of these people, who could be very polite 
and Œ and com Œ polite society, in their polite 
society, and yet they Œ th-there was Œ the 
Germans did an analysis of one of their bi
g meetings and it survived the war, and I saw 
it in 
Germany
, in fact. This was after the war. And it was appalling to see these people

who were responsible for th-th-the disposal
 of human beings, joking about it and going 
about it in such a deta
ch ed way. No  Œ no Œ no emotion in
volved. Well, but at any rate, 
that™s not pertinent to what
 we™re talking about, but Œ 
Q: It is, but it is not Œ it™s not direct witne ss, it is the impressions that you get after the 
fact. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: So it ties in, it ties in. 
A: That™s right. It didn™t have to be a visual presentation at all. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: You just think of the idea, planning 
and executing th ese people in such a way.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: And this was the other way. These were 
the dregs. These were Œ these were not the 

people wh o were employed in 
[indecipherable]
 plants all through 
Germany
, or Œ there 
Œ there were a lot of commercial p roperties th
at were ma naged and run by these people. 
Some fantastic stories about that, but 
seeing it is an emotional experience. 
Q: Did you talk about it to your folk

Q: When  Œ when  
Patton 
moved on at that clip, that pretty fast clip of moving, you 
know, such a wall of humanity fo
rward, 50 mi Œ did you go fo
rward as well, as part of 
that? 
A: No, well, the country is vast. 
Q: Okay . 

A: We had the Œ the Œ th e third army  had the southern quarter of 
Germany
 to take care 
of. We Œ we were Œ were Œ we were at one point closest to 
Berlin
, then moved down , 
on orders, of course. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And 
Patton
 was assigned this last southeastern quarter of 
Germany
, and what went 
with it, a little bit of 
Czechoslovakia
. 
Q: Right. 

A: And Œ and 
Austria
, of course. 
Q: Right. 
A: The Austrian experience is also  Œ th
at™s where they have separate comment. 
Q: I™d like to get there. 
A: We were all a little anxious, I suppose. We 
were doing very well, 
but when you™re in 
a battle, if you™re moving forward, you feel 
pretty good about that
, but your Œ you™re 
further exposing yourself to doom. And th
e Œ I was Œ I was not aware of Œ of this 
sweep, but I knew it happened. And in fact, af
ter Œ after the Battle of the Bulge, our Œ

our Œ our army  Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I™m afraid I Œ I 
shouldn™t say our army , I wasn™t in the army , 
but I Œ in that army, but because I Œ of my
 personal experience. But oh, the casu alties 
were fearsome. And the men who really fo
ught have a different, instinctive feeling 
about it. But our infan Œ infantry really ch 
Œ went thro ugh th em so fast, that we had 
some surprises. We overtook the Œ the retrea
t of the Germans. They™d retreat a while, 
then they™d surrender. And so 
Œ but as I say, in Œ in 
Austria
 they got another picture of 
it. 
Q: What happened in  
Austria
? 
A: Because they were Œ these were civilians
 and Œ and the Austrian
s that were in the 
army were, of course, in the German army. 
And so  they didn™t have mu ch to do in 
Austria
. I know wa Œ in our experience, the Au
strian takeover was a cinch, after the 
fighting that we had done before. 
Q: Was this already Œ if you were in 
Ohrd ruf
 in a Œ in Ap ril, where did you Œ when  the 
war ended in early May, do you rememb
er that, where you were at the time? 
A: Yes, I was in 
Linz
, 
Austria
. 
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: Sure. Sure, I Œ the Œ the end of war is r
eally the end of war for Œ for the Austrians, 
there was nothing. And all the pretty girl
s, some very eager to cooperate ger Œ 
Austrians, but not Œ not resisting. We had to 
face the possibility that we™d have to fight

through it, but they  didn™t have Œ they did Œ 
they didn™t have a home guard or anything, 
to give us any trouble, so 
[inaudible] 
Q: Let™s talk then about th
at second Œ second episode Œ 
A: Oh yeah, well, that™s a different thing en
tirely, and Œ and in  retrospect, it™s a funny 
experience. I enjoyed it so much afterwards
, because it was so dangerous when it was 
done.  
Q: So tell us about that. 
A: I Œ we were Œ we were stationed in 
Linz
, in western 
Austria
, and I was Œ I Œ I had 
attached myself to the Œ to 
the intelligence section of the 
army. And get Œ got to know a 
very affable, probably 25 year old major 
who was working there too. He was an 
infantry officer, a big man. I 
Œ apparently he certainly neve
r showed any fear or anxiety 
under extreme pressure. But at any rate, I re
ported in one day. It was across town, I was 
with ya Œ with my infantry friends, and Œ 
eating there and so forth. So I came in one 
mo rning, about eight o™clock I suppose, a
nd there was this major whose name I can™t 

remember Œ and that™s a shame,
 y ou know, that just Œ should
 never forget the name of 
somebody who made such an impression. Bu
t at any rate, he wa
s a good Œ good old 
boy, an Irish American, and he lo oked in his flushed face 
[indecipherable]
 and he 
looked very affable, frie
ndly, to ok care of his non-coms and was very mu ch 
appreciated. So, he had come in to the office just before me
, and he got a call from the 
director of the mu seum. And the director said
 oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

this way, but he heard about 
the Œ the exchange of troops. 
We had gone on th e Œ on the 
u-upper Austrian side of the 
Do na u
 river, and had Œ th e Russians had moved in too far 
when  we Œ when  we met. There was a cleric
al error. So that wa
s passed. The Russians 
were in that territory, we didn™t try to 
throw them out, of course. But they were 
advanced maybe Œ maybe a couple of miles on 
Œ on what was supposed to be a straight 
line of division. And so  they 
now Œ now decided that they 
would settle all this at the 
very highest level. Probably 
Patton
 himself participated, and 
they decided they™d better 
change this. So they got t
ogeth er with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, 
the Russians would pull back, and we would 
mo Œ we™d move forw
ard into that area. 
And wh en Œ although we didn™t
 know anything, or I didn™t
 know anything, of course, 
let me  say that when  I say we don™t know, 
that means I don™t know. But at any rate, I 
didn™t know there were planning to  do this
, they didn™t consult 
me. And so, both the 
major and I were very upset. Wh at happened 
was, when we first 
came in, the major 
went over to this museum, and talked to 
the director, who seemed to be a perfectly 
reasonable sort of person, to see were there 
kind of an y pictures that were reputed to 
have been put there by 
Hitler
. And Œ excu se Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: The director at that time said that no, 
there were no pictures, but that we could see 
that there were spaces where pictures had be
en. And we didn™t know what Œ what wa Œ 
happened  to  them. So Œ but nevertheless, 
any amount of questioning as the director, 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

58
produced no answers. And then  of course, s
uddenly, the Œ there came this change, and 
he discovered wh at he knew, or something, th
at the pictures were in a certain farm wa Œ 
in a Œ in a barn, couple of miles in
 Œ in that area. And so he said Œ 
Q: Where the Russians were Œ where the Soviets were. 
A: Yeah, right. And he had Œ he had the Œ in
 fact, address. He knew exactly how to get 
there. He™d obviously checke
d somebody. Wh at they were
, were cases, beautifully 
made, of wood, for each picture, whether it™
s small or large, and were beveled off so 
that they wouldn™t hurt anything.
 And he said, he se Œ he wa
s sort of apologetic because 
he knew he should have re
vealed this before. Although 
I do Œ I think if that had 
happened , what would happen
 is the Ru ssians would have stiffened, and taken him 
away. So  we™re probably lucky that this 
happened. And Œ and so, th ey Œ I™m Œ I™m 
surprised they didn™t have Russian guards 
on Œ on these things. But, at any rate Œ 

Q: Did he ask Œ was his request to your Irish
 American major that 
Œ that the Americans 
go and get his pictures back? Wa
s that what the request was? 
A: No, it was a sort of a Œ a spontaneous r
eaction of idiocy by everybody there, you 
know, they Œ they rea
lly Œ we all agreed. 
Q: That you had to get the pictures back? 
A: Yeah, had to get the pictures back. And 
I don™t know what happened to me. I Œ I™m 
not prone to make profound decisions like 
this, but Œ but he we
nt around, and asked 
each soldier, do you want to go? It™s
 a little d angerous, but let™s go. 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure

59
Q: And this is your major? Yeah. 
A: Yeah, this fella, he didn™t
 know any more than I did really, but at any rate, he™s a 
very low rank in  that big army , and he wa
s making an aw ful decision. But he Œ we 
could have all been wiped out. Was 
the craziest thing, going over the 
Linz
 bridge, to 
the other side of the 
Do na u
, and feeling that you might 
be going to your death. 
Anyway , there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or 

something, whatever had been assigned to
 them. And it was a Œ I thought it was a 
comical thing afterwards, but I didn™t think th
at Œ very  mu ch that 
way at the time. So 
we all went in a little convoy, 
with the major out ahead in a 
Jeep
, and mo st of us back 
in the trucks. We had two bi
g trucks, and we didn™t know
 how much  we were going to  
face. Well, we got out there, and in very 
short order I remember thinking, if I were 
driving, I wouldn™t have been that Œ that Œ th
at good. Bu t we arrived in there, in the top 
of an enormous barn. You know th e way th os
e barns were constructed? They used the 

upper levels for hay that they dropped dow
n in the spring. And 
so there were the 
pictures, among a lot of 
fressen
 for the cow Œ for the Œ the bu
lls, or what have you. And 
the Œ we became a little worried, 
because the biggest thing of
 the lot Œ not Œ not Œ not 
the Œ the heaviest thing was an unusual shap
e. It was about two feet wide, two feet 
high, and about six feet long,
 and weighed like lead, oh. We
 c Œ we Œ we could move 
the pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we
 didn™t know what it wa
s, we couldn™t take 
the time to open it, and 
so we thought we had 
[indecipherable]
 take Œ take it. So for

our two and a half ton truck, we Œ we put it on the Œ th e Œ down  early. Bu t it took all the 
mu scular strength we could master. And so 
when we got back, w-we drove back, and 
that was a terrorizing experience, because 
there was nothing but de
ath. No thing moved 
in that whole distance that we had Œ 

Q: You did Œ did you Œ 

A: Œ that Œ that they had evacuated. 

Q: So no people were there, at the Œ 
A: Huh? 
Q: No people were at the farmhouse, or Œ 

A: No, no, well, I™m sure there™s some took th
e alternative of goin g 
into the cellar, to be 
discovered later. But an awful lot of them went visiting th e relatives and friends in the 

safe part of town. 

Q: No Soviet soldiers? 

A: Hm? 
Q: Did you see any Soviet soldiers? 
A: No, I saw Œ I didn™t even see an Œ an ordi
nary dog. You know, th
ey Œ the little street 
dogs everywhere. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But we saw nothing 
breeding in that area. 
Q: The dogs went visiting too? 

 
Interview with Brooks McClure  
 
July 7, 2011 
 

 
 
61
A: Oh yeah, I mean, th ey went
 visiting or Œ or hid in the 
cellar, too. But at any rate, it 
was just a naked run really, from the safe sa 
Œ  place, to this Œ and it wasn™t too long, 
and so I figure a couple mile
s, ma ybe. Then  we lo
aded  it all up, and came back. And of 
course, that was the loneliest automobile tr
ip I ever made. And so we went across the 
bridge and got back, and we Œ 
we decided to put it in the mu seum, we could put a guard  
on it there. And we didn™t have anybody el 
Œ of the ability to examine them, and we Œ 
we didn™t want to Œ there, there wa
s a Œ was a big station in  Œ in south 
Germany
, near 
Munich
. 
Munich
 th Œ yielded an awful lo t of thos
e paintings. And they had Œ there we 
had some American Œ those specialists, 
who knew these paintings, you know. You 
needed  somebody like that to ma ke a judgment.  
Q: Did you open up the cases, though? 
A: No, but we did open 
up one. The major said, 
that damn thing that 
[indecipherable]
 
and so forth. He wanted to see what was in it, so we opened it. Was a beautifully 

encased box. And what was it? It
 was a rowing machine with a 
[indecipherable]
 iron 
base, that apparently the officer
s wanted to  take with them, or get rid of, or something. 
Didn™t want to yield to the Russians, maybe
. So in all that happened, we had a good 
laugh after. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Bu-B ut 
[indecipherable]
, it tied us up for a while.

Q: So was this Œ did this whole thing es Œ 
did this whole adventur
e take half a day? A 
day? 
A: Oh, well you can be sure we 
did it as fast as we could. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And that Œ see, that was early in the 
morning when we first 
got the word, and the 
major took no Œ no time making arrangements w
ith the mo tor office. And, we were up 
and gone in Œ in a matter, I™m afraid, of mi
nutes. Every ab le-bodied 
soldier in the area 
were Œ well, at least there was a mass of 
early risers, you know. And the major went 
around, asked each one of them, you kn
ow, why th ey Œ why th ey do this. 
Q: Any flak about it Œ 
A: And he guessed ri
ght. Huh Œ huh? 
Q: Any flak about it from the higher ups later? 
A: None Œ none that I heard of. I didn™t st
ay on very much longer. I got reassigned to 
France
. I was going to  go home, and they  put 
me in a safer place, I guess. But oh, I 
was Œ that was quite an experience.  

Q: Quite an adventure. 

A: Oh yeah. And I Œ I Œ I thought it was, th
inking about it afterwards, I thought it was 
pretty darn  clever of these fellows to say ye
s, you know, that™s Œ then it™s a very freaky 
thing. I™m sure that if you ask th e same people, a lot of them would have said no. But 

that™s th Œ I know ho
w those things happen.

Q: Well, when you™re young, 
and the war is over, it sort of 
Œ it can go with the territory. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It can go Œ so tell me, when did you re
turn back to the Stat
es? D id you stay in 
Euro pe
 much longer after the war ended? 
A: Well, I was assigned to a place in 
Mourmelon
 in  
France
. I then was shipped to 
Paris
, and got a job as an editor on the ﬁ
Stars and Stripes
,ﬂ which I thought was a 
delightfu l way to finish up with  the army . A
nd th en in due course I had enough credits 
to come home. Was a lovely  assignment th
ere. I don™t know wh at happened to  the 
teletypes. They just never showed up. 

Q: I guess not. Well, is there anything else 
you™d like to add to Œ to this story that 
we™ve talked about this morning? 

A: No, I don™t think so. There Œ there™s an af
ter play, you might say. I stayed on in Œ in 
Austria 
for quite a time, and these people got out 
of their cages, and they™d just walk 
around, stupefied. I don™t know how th ey ate.
 I Œ I was a nonsmoker, and it Œ but I took 
my smoking rations. And cigarettes were wort
h an awfu l lot of money. You could get a 
dinner, a whole dinner, for a cigarette in so
me places. And I had no use for them, so Œ 
so I Œ I Œ I gave mine away, rather than de
stroy th em. And th ey di Œ they™d  know, as 
soon as they saw the cigarettes, I was be
ing a friendly Œ I-I don™t 
know how they  were 
treated by other soldiers, you know? And it™s 
a terribly disturbing thing if somebody

comes up and says in a perfectly modulat
ed civilian voice, something obviously  
understandable, if you coul
d understand the language. It
™s a terrible feeling. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Sometimes they just want a sa Œ a cigarett
e, or some Œ or a Œ 
or Œ they™d  never ask 
for a cigarette. They™d get it 
if somebody gave it to them. 
It was much too valuable a 
piece of property. 
Q: You™re talking now about pe
ople who had been prisoners? 
A: Yes, right, and Œ 

Q: Former prisoners. 

A: Œ didn™t speak a language that I understood. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: By then I could get along all right
 for primitive things in da Œ German. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I had studied it, and so I ha Œ had an
 advantage. But I don™t know, it Œ it seems 
unreal. I don™t even think I Œ sometimes 
I don™t think I ha Œ I went there.  
Q: It™s not Œ you know, there are people I™ve ta
lked to who have been  survivors of some 
of these camps, and they say the same thing. So
metimes they say, I w
onder if this really 
happened to me.
