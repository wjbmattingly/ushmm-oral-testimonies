 I apologize for mispronounci

born, and when ?  

A: I was born November 5
th
, 1942 in
 Berlin, Germany
. 
Q: And what did your parents do for a living? 

A: My father was a buyer. Not sure what th
at means, I™ve heard different versions. 
I™ve heard th at, you know, it could be a 
bookkeeper, it could be, you know, a buyer 
[indecipherable]
. My mother was a sea mstre ss,
 as her mother was, my 
grandmother. So Œ 

Q: Did you have any br
others and sisters? 

A: No. 
Q: No, you were 
an only child. 
A: I™m an only child, yes. My mo Œ I™m 
told I™m a lot lik e my mother, and Œ which 
means I™m stubborn. Bu t she decided she was 
going to have a baby at a particular 
age, and no matter what the 
world situation was, she was 
gonna have that baby. And

she thought, well, if something happens, 
they get taken away, her mo ther, my  
grandmother, would take care of me. And then
 they™ll come back and take over. It 
never occu rred to her th at th
ey may not come back. So Œ 
Q: So, did your Œ di
d your family all live togethe
r, did your pare
nts and your 
grandparents live together in a Œ did 
they live in the 
same neighborhood? 
A: No, my  parents did for
ced labor, so my grandparen
ts took care of me. My 
grandfather was Catholic, so my  grandmot
her was protected wh ile he was alive. 
Q: Right. 

A: Anyway, so every eveni
ng my  parents would come to
 visit me, and one day my  
former landlady came running up and said, 
Frau Cheever
(ph), they™re taking them. 
And she stood on the balcony and watched 
my  parents being taken away by the 
Gestapo. And I was three months old, they  were taken to 
Auschwitz
. I have Œ I 
finally found a permanent Œ let™s say a defi
nite death date for my father, and that 
was March 28
th
, 1943. And for my paren Œ my  mother, it just says the end of March. 
And just within this last month I got 
a lot of documents about myself and my 
grandmother, and my  parents. And is Œ it da
 Œ so I say, now I have absolute proof 
that I™m a survivor Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ because I Œ it shows, you know, everything.

Q: So you had a birt
h certificate, or Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ or some sort of documentation, yeah . 
A: Well, that™s not what I just got. 
Q: Right, but you had Œ you had had it Œ 

A: But this is 
[indecipherable]
 the camps. 
Q: Right. 
A: So 
Auschwitz
, 
Theresienstadt
. 
Q: Mm-hm. But you had a birth 
certificate when you were born. 
A: Yes. 
Q: That Œ that Œ 
A: I Œ I got a copy years ago I need ed 
[indecipherable]
 to prove my age, so yes. 
Q: Yeah. And so  your Œ your grandparents 
were taking care of you at this point. 
A: Mm. 
Q: When a Œ you wound up in 
Theresienstadt
, how Œ how did you get from 
Berlin
 
to 
Theresienstadt
? 
A: Well, evidently my grandmothe
r knew she was going to go to 
Theresienst adt
. 
She had a family frien d that worked for th
e underground. And the lady said, well, I 
think Œ well, they called me
 Gitta
, which was my German name. The 
Hitler
 regime

didn™t allow me to keep a Germ
an name, so it was changed to 
Gittel. 
So she says, 
oh, I think it is best chance for survival wa
s to go into camp w
ith her, so I went to 
Theresienstadt
 with her. And I was in the nursery, and I was, you know, a toddler 
at that point. 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 

A: And my grandmother would scrub th e si
dewalks and the step
s with cold water, 
and ev ery winter her hands w
ould turn  blue, because of that experience, the rest of 
her life. 

Q: Right. 

A: It Œ that affected her that much. 
Q: Do you have any memo
r Œ any recollection of 
Theresienstadt
 at all? 
A: No. My  husband thinks I™m blocking it out.  
Q: So what do you thi Œ wh at do you 
think your first memo
ry is, that the Œ 
A: After Œ in
 Berlin Œ 
Q: In 
Berlin. 
A: Œ going to services every Frid ay night
, and no matter who my  grandmother met, 
she would tell my story, or our story. 
And I guess she didn™t realize little pictures 
have big ears, and that I knew ev erythi
ng. And by the time we came to the 
U.S.

when I was 13, she finally to
ld me about my  story, wh ich I had known all along, but 
didn't  say. 
Q: Right. 
A: And she used to say, if I™d asked 
about my mo ther, you know, where™s my  
mother, oh she™s in 
America
. And I have Œ I™m in two books now. In  the first book, 
that™s entitled, ﬁMy De
ar Mother is in 
America
,ﬂ and Œ my  grandmother did an 
interview before we left 
Berlin
, and that was the title of the story. 
Q: Right. 
A: And she just didn™t want me to know
. And I Œ I™m thinking logically, when I 
came here I would say where she was, a
nd I mu st have blocked it out because I 
don™t know the answer.  

Q: Right. 

A: You know, how did she, 
at that point, cover up that my  mo ther was not here. 
Q: And what happened to your grandfather? 
A: He had tuberculosis and cance
r and died. And that™s when  Œ 
Q: Mm-hm, in 
Berlin
. 
A: Œ yeah , and that™s when  she lo
st her protection and we went Œ 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Œ to 
Theresienstadt
 at that point.

Q: Now, was Œ was your grandmother practic
ing her faith wh ile Œ 
or Œ or Œ before 
the war, was she practicing her faith, or Œ 
A: I think so , yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Just from what my uncle said, because hi
s attitude was, religion™s not important, 
least of all judi Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ least of all, Judaism. 
And we would go to services 
every Frid ay night, and high 
holy day service and ev erything. And then  
she™d say to me, well, there can™t be a 
God if He let your mo th er die. So I grew 
up with mixed messag
es, in my  opinion. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: You know.  

Q: Being taken to services.  

A: I don™t how much to elaborate, so I™m goi
ng to let you just lead the story. I Œ I 
could say mo re Œ 

Q: No, I mean, feel free to con Œ I mean, it™
s Œ it™s Œ it™s a question that we ask a lot 
of our survivors because ther
e is such Œ almost a struggle between th eir reality of 
what they experienced, and their faith
. And so it™s why we ask the question. 

A: No, we Œ I mean, we went to serv
ices very Œ you know, every week.

Q: And so, when  you Œ when  you came out of 
Theresienstadt
, you were three? 
A: Almost three. 
Q: Almo st three. And you Œ you went back to 
Berlin
? 
A: We went back to the 
Berlin
, to the same apartment 
we lived in before, and 
waited for my parents to come back. 

Q: Right. 

A: And she Œ you know, she just
 expected they™d be back . 
Q: Right. 

A: And just before we left 
Germany
, she got copies of th
eir death certificates. 
Q: When did you leave 
Germany
? 
A: In ™51. 

Q: ™51? 

A: I landed the day after my  ninth birthday in 
New York. 
So it™s a very easy day to 
remember. 
Q: Yeah. What Œ wh
ile you were still in 
Germany
, I assume you started going to 
school again Œ or
 started school. 
A: Yes, I did Œ I did start school. 

Q: And you were speaking Œ 
A: I went there for like two years. 

 
Interview with Gittel Jaskulski

10
Q: Right. 
A: I learned some English, so I knew, ta
ble, door and ch air. Lot of English to  get 

started in a new country. 
Q: Well, it™s better than nothing. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you were Œ you were 
startin g school, you were learning a little bit of English. 
Di Œ was Œ was it always 
your grandmothers inten
tion to take you to the 
United 
States, 
or Œ did she want to stay in 
Berlin
? 
A: There was a comp ensation fo r having be
en in the camp. An
d my uncle didn™t 
talk to my grandmother for three years. 
She would bake every week  in case he 
would co me, he didn't come. I Œ I think I 
suspect why he didn't  come . I have no 
other Œ 

Q: Why is that? No Œ 

A: She befriended a Œ a gentleman, for lack
 of a better word , and he abused me, and 
I think th at™s why he stoppe
d visiting his mo ther, becaus
e he was so against this 
man. This lady that worked for the unde
rgro und, boo Œ we went back , after my  
grandmother died, I went back to 
Germany
 with my  whole family, my  husband and 
my  three sons. And this lady that work ed
 for the underground, I met her, and she 
said something to me, and I said, how di
d you know, I never 
told anybody, you

know, that I was sexually abused. And she sa
id, I suspected by the way he held  you 
on his lap. And so, I would th
ink, you know, my  uncle pr
obably did, too. And, you 
know, now I think, well, why didn't so
mebody do something to  protect me from 
that? 
Q: Mm-hm, yeah. 

A: So Œ 

Q: So this is while you were still in 
Berlin
, or this is when you go to Œ 
A: While I was in 
Berlin. 
Q: Do you think that influenced
 your grandmother™s decision? 

A: I think th at™s why my  uncle didn™t come around Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ and since he didn™t come around, she 
thought my best chan
ce for survival was 
to come to 
America.
 And like I said in my
 documentary, I love my children, I don™t 
know if I could give up
 my country for them. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: You know? So Œ 

Q: Wow. And d Œ you Œ you 
never talked to your gran
dmother about the abuse? Did 
she Œ do you think she knew about it?

A: And on the ship someone said to her, yo

because nobody is going to 
wait that long for domestic
 help. So we come to 
New 
York
, and th ey said, you can™t stay in 
New Yo rk
 because the population is too 
great, so choose someplace to go. And she had relatives in 
California

want them to feel obligated to take
 care of us, so she decided ag ainst
 California.
 
She had old family fri
ends that lived in

 for somebody. Didn™t earn 
Social Security like that. 
Q: Right. 
A: I mean, she didn™t earn like a regular pa
ycheck, but that™s Œ you know, and there 
was comp ensation money, she got 
[indecipherable]
 and some money for me until I

was 18, so that™s what we liv
ed off of. And we qualified for public aid, or wh atever 
you called it at the time. 
Q: Right. 
A: And being strong, or Œ I™m Œ I™m Œ can™
t think of the word 
right now, but they 
would co me every month and ask the same questions, like how many rooms do you 
have, and how many bathrooms do you have
? And she™d, that doesn™t change, you 
know, from month to month. 
Q: You™re living in the same place.

Œ you have three sons? 
A: Three sons and five granddaughters, so Œ 
Q: Oh wow, wow.

16
Q: You don™t have any memo
ries. Do y Œ do you th ink you
 have Œ well, I mean, you 
were so young. 
A: Yeah.  
Q: But Œ 
A: But you Œ wh at™s intere
sting, and my  husband has 
found this too, when I™m 
among su rvivors Œ first of all, I don™t have 
to explain myself, and I think just like 
they do, I fall right in with 
them, in spite of it. So I don™t know if it was like raised 
into me, or what. Bu t I am, you know, very co
mfortable i-in this type of situation, 
or with a group that we had, you know. 
And so , we think the same way, you know 
you Œ I have a stack of food, let™s say, yo
u know, so I never Œ even  though we were 
both unemployed fo r a long time, I never wo
rried about food, because I have that 
stock. 

Q: Right. 

A: That™s my security blanket. 
Q: Right. 
A: So we Œ we all fall into that. 

Q: And when you Œ wh en yo
u were Œ well, you were too young to  rememb er what it 
was like in 
Theresienstadt, 
but wh en you were in 
Berlin
, did you Œ do you 
reme mb er being hungry? Were you Œ 

 
Interview with Gittel Jaskulski  
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
17
A: No. 
Q: No? It™s just an innate quality that yo
u have now, that yo
u have to stockpile 
food? 
A: I don™t know. 
Q: Yeah.  

A: Can™t pass up a good deal 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: When you were in Œ 
when you were
 back in 
Berlin
, do you rememb
er, after the 
war is over, do you rememb er anti-Semitism 
at all? Were you experiencing th at?  
A: I Œ you know, I think I was too young 
to know that, and 
as I grew up in 
Chica go
, 
I knew people didn't like me, but I didn
't know why. When I started work ing is 
when I really experienced anti-Semitism, 
I had to quit a job because of it. I was 
threatened, and I was harassed. One of my ki
ds in particular says the Holo caust has 
really affected him. For in
stance, when the series ﬁ
Holocaust
ﬂ was on 
TV, 
he came 
home with Œ somebody 
told him a joke that I don™t 
rememb er, but it ended up with, 
all you need is an ashtray for six million Jews. And so, what I say to the audience, 

how do you respond to that as a human be
ing, as a Jew, let alone as a survivor? 
Q: Right. 
A: And so now, I talk about the different th
ings that have happened in my life that 
has affected me because of 
the Holocaust, you know?  

 
Interview with Gittel Jaskulski  
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
18
Q: Yeah. 
A: So that™s really where my story is co
ming in, because everyone says oh, well, 
you™re lucky you don™t have memories. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I said, well Œ and now what I™m emp h
asizing, doesn™t mean it didn™t affect 

me. 

Q: Right. 
A: And how it™s affected me, my children 
and my  gran dchildren. And fir Œ I mean, 
first of all, you don™t have, 
you know, family get-togeth er
s, be it for holiday, or my 
graduation or wh atever, you know? And ev
en my  grandchildren are mi ssing out on 
all of that. 
Q: Right. 

A: Because the family is
 not there. So last 
Rosh Hashanah 
weeke Œ we™ve got one 
congregation we belong to that
 I absolutely love. We never 
used to go to services, I 
belong to  two co ngregations over 13 years, 
and people didn't even say hello to me. 
And now, if I™m not going to be here, like 
this last Friday, don™t worry about me, 
I™m fine, I™m going to be out of town
, you know. So , the second co ngregation, 
Holocaust survivors are free. 

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Gittel Jaskulski  
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
19
A: It™s a co ngregation that broke off from 
another congregation. So they have what 
they Œ are called a p
itch-in dinner for 
Rosh  Ha shanah 
eve, eve 
Rosh Hashanah. 
And, you know, I never had a family holid ay 
dinner. I™d like to se
e what that™s like. 
Q: Right. 
A: Let™s skip 
Rosh Hashanah 
services, you know, we™re there all d ay long, we Œ 
you know, we™ll miss that. An
d I got woken up th e next mo rn
ing, I didn't  see you at 
services last night, are you okay, is 
Vern
 okay? Missed you,
 and Œ you know, 
because my husband had two lung collapses
 and lung surgery this year. So, you 
know, people, of course, are Œ are very aw
are of what™s going 
on in our lives. So, 
it™s a totally different Œ so I™ve had Œ 
even like this year, some very new 
experiences. I n Œ I had Œ I™ve had so many people say, oh, forget about the 

Holo caust, put it behind you. Lot 
of Œ from different people Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ comments like that. Or there™s no more 
prejudism 
in the world, you know, 
and we all know better than 
that. So yeah, there™s more 
and mo re Œ obviously my  Œ 
I don™t feel my life is normal Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ because of it has been affected in 
spite of my  age, an-and no memo ries, you 
know?

Q: Do you Œ I mean, do you have Œ I don™t 
know, did you ever find an organization, 
especially when you were 
younger, did you ever think 
that maybe there would be 
something out there for other Ho locaust surv
ivors? Did people talk to you about it, 
did they  ask you questions about it? 
A: Okay, I Œ I used to say, my parent
s didn™t survive th
e Holocaust, and my 
grandmother did. An d I never put my self in
 that picture. And 
in 1981 was the world 
gathering of Holocaust survivors in 
Israel
, was the first event 
I attended. And my  
son was on a work study program in 
Israel 
at the time. He™s now, of course, you 
know, almost Hassidic, I mean, he™s u
ltra-Orthodox. He was on a work study 
program, quit the program in order to join 
me for the gath ering. We went to kibbutz 
comprised of survivors from 
Theresienstadt
. And the man, among the racks and 
racks of documents found my  name, and 
my grandmother™s name, wrote down for 
me what transport I was on, how many 
were on th e transport, and how many 
survived. And at that point 
it hit me, that this happened
 to me, and I™m a survivor. 
Q: Right. 

A: And my life changed a lot after that. 

Q: How did it change? 
A: Well, because now I™m talking about 
it all the time, an d I™m realizing it did 
affect me, youknow?

that you Œ behaviors that 
you had, that once you found out all of 
this, and fo und paperwork and saw proof, 
did you make the connecti
on between that behavior, 
and oh, it™s because I™m a 
Holocaust survivor. 
A: Yeah, now I Œ I™ve Œ certainly I see that
, b ecause as I talk to other people Œ like 
one of the guys from my  group
 said, look it, I have all this fruit, because I didn't 
have that as a child, and I know I have so
 much it™s gonna spoil, but that™s just 
because of the war. And like, 
you know, we talked about I have a stack of food Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ that I™m not gonna worry. But when 
we join our presen
t congregation, the 
rabbi was hemming and hawing and he says
, this is very awkward, and I don™t 
know how to say this, I just 
have to come up with it, we have a food pantry, and, 

you know, I can get food ev er
y week. And I said, just ask my kids, I™ve got too 

mu ch Œ an d I said, I have too mu ch  food. 
Nobody has Œ has too much food, he said. 
I says, just ask my children, I have too 
much food, you 
know. And we just had like 
flooding in the baseme nt, we had terrible ra
in, we had to  throw out a bunch of food. 
I™m not worried about it. I™ve got food th
at™s way outdated, I™m sure, you know.

A: I always knew I Œ 
Q: Did you feel awkward in school becaus
e of that? Because of
 the autobiography Œ 
A: I always knew I was different, but
 I didn™t know why, you know? And 
everybody had parents, and it just Œ I d
on™t know. I hi Œ why Œ I mean, I made 
different friends and this one girlfriend, I spent weekends with them, and I called 

her parents mom and dad, and so  I 
had a little sense of family there. 
Q: Mm-hm. Do you think that ri Œ you Œ 
it sounds like you™re close with your si Œ 
with your children an d your gran dchildren, do
 you think you™ve created that to Œ to 
find a family that you didn™t have Œ 
A: Well, family is important to me Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ you know, obviously. 

Q: Right. 

A: Cause I Œ you know, grew up without

cuts us off at her Œ her whim, and my

three years, and her mother was also a su
rvivor. And so now she™s starting to get 
involved a little bit with the 
Second Generation. It™s ve
ry difficult, you know, we 
just had ano Œ I mean
, that cookbook Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ the Holocaust cookbook, okay? And Œ so 
I ge Œ all I ever hear about is I can™t 
deal with the subject, okay? So , I did not
 give my  son or my  granddaughters a 
choice. So I gave them each a book and I wrote something in it. I didn't give her 
one, it didn™t occur to me. Like I se Œ yo
u know, and she™s never let me explain 
what my  thinking was. They  don™t have a c
hoice but deal with it, they have to deal 
with it, because I™m here. 

Q: Right. 
A: But she doesn ™t, okay? So 
then, that caused another 
rift. And my other daughter-
in-law, ‚why would you improve me™ attitude. 
In fact, they don™t 
even have a copy 
of the book yet. So, it™s were Œ they chan
ged the book now fo r s Œ both Œ tw ice, and 
both times was because of me. 
Well, the first time my Orthod
ox family that cuts me 
off all the time, their pictures weren™t in
 Œ in th e book, so they had to add the 
pictures. 
Q: Right.
