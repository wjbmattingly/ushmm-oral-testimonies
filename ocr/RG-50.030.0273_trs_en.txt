QUESTION:  Ilse Sauer, 
if you woul d jus t  be gin 
by tel ling me your na me , 
dat e of birt h and where  
you wer e born.   
ANSWER:  Okay.  My name is Isle
 Sauer , nee Ils edor e Rudol phosou. 
 I was born in 1923 in Penslo 
(ph.), a small  town 
north of Berlin.  
Q:  Tell me a little bit about yo
ur family and your town.   
A:  I was  a n onl y c hild.  My pare nt
s got married pretty late
 in li fe a nd -- a nd our
 life in Penslo was 
my earl y chi l dhood what  was quit e
 nor mal.  We had a siza ble  Jewi
sh community in Penslo.  There  
were a number of Jewish fa mili
es.  We had a  bea uti ful synogog
ue and we, chil dr en, l ater on 
attended religious school there.  
Well , whe n I wa s six ye ars ol d I star
ted public school and after four 
years of el e me ntar y sc hool I wa s 
awarded a scholarshi p to a l yceum
 and a n all girls a c ade mic hi gh 
school , but before my first year 
there was over my
 schol ars hip wa s revoke d and I was noti fie d that  
we  would no longer  welc ome at t hat  s chool.  
So all  -- bec aus e I  wa s 
J e wish.  And --    
Q:  What  year was that?  

A:  It was in 1943 -- 193
4.  Excuse me.  It was in
 1934 and alr
eady at that time th
e anti-semitism in 
Penslo was quite wi de sp
r ead as it was in many 
smaller towns.     
Q:  No w, what kind of bus
iness was your  fat her i n ?   
A:  My  fat h er was , wh at  yo u w
oul d probabl y cal l a commercial arti
st.  He mainly concentrated on 
desi gns for e mbroi der y.  In those da ys there wer e
 a lot of fa ncy e mbr oidery of t able clothes a nd  
linen a nd e v erythi ng a nd that wa s hi s mai n oc cupa
tion.  And --  Q:  Wa s 
your life style fairly  
comfortabl e?  

A:  Our li f estyle was - -  yes , was a mi ddl e --
 mi ddle cla ss Je wi sh fa mi l y.  We  lived quit e  
comfortabl y and i n the be ginning 
in my early childhood everything 
wa s all right .  Then when I ha d 
to leave t he speci al school I was for c
ed to go back to the public sc
hool which i n th
ose  days publi c 
education l a sted for eight year s an
d I  graduat ed i n 1937 at  the age 
of 14.  Because there were no

opport unit y of me in Pe nslo my 
par e nts se nt me  to a Jewi sh hous
ehold s chool in the  suburbs o f 
Berlin which was actually to
 learn all kinds of domes
tic skills including child 
care.  During that year 
my parent s move d to Berlin into an apartment in 
an apart ment house.  Beca
use life  in Penslo had 
bec o me i ntol erable .  
Q:  Let me a sk you a que stion be for e you go
 on.  Did --  was  your
 fa mily religious?  
A:  No.  M y fa mil y wa s act uall y not reli gious  as 
such.  My fat her  especi
ally was a stanch (ph.) 
cellar (ph.) J ew who would fi ght for 
his Judais m a ny chanc e he  would get.  See , in those  years Je w s  
wer e alrea dy taunte d a lot, being call ed na me s an
d eve n physi cally pus hed around and my fat her  
would go out at night wi th his s na ppy wa lki ng st
ick and whe n some body 
would ta unt  hi m or he  
would c o me  across a young Na
zi boy he would t ry to hit the m 
with hi s c a ne whic h s o meti me s got 
him into trouble and my
 mother  wa s always  worr i ed about  hi m.  
Q:  I'm trying to get a sense of 
just the build up on the anti-semiti
sm and whether thi s
 wa s a fact o f  
life before Hitler came to powe
r and how it progressed.  

A:  It was already before  Hitler came to power.  
There were already signs 
of anti-semitism and then  
when Hitler came to power,
 as I said, in 1934 mo
st of the men had joined
 the Nazi party.  The  
youngsters were in the Hitle
r youth and they had horrast
 us Jews qu
ite a bit.  
Q:  I n what wa y?   

A:  Well , they would ca ll us na
me s.  They some ti me s would push 
me ar ound in s chool a nd out .  
The y were belittling us a nd, you know
, it was not  too ple asa nt .  I mea
n, some of the Gentile s, I ha d 
some Gentil e girl friends , but  late
r on when they jo
ine d t he Hi tler yout h t h ey wer e s o brainwas he d 
agai nst Je ws  that for me r  fri ends woul d not dare t o
 associate wi th a Jew an
y longer.  Be caus e in a  
s mall t o wn, you know, e ver
ybody knew everybody.  It 
was di ffer ent  in a large 
city like Jovi an (ph.) .  
Q:  How di d you ma ke  se nse  
of it?  Di d you talk about 
it wit h your  par ent s?     
A:  Yes, certainly we talked w
ith my parents also with other 
youngst ers .  You know, we wer e  
talking about these things
.  About -- t hey were i nvisible bec aus
e, you know, the Na
zis got str onger  
and stronger and life  b
ecame mor e di fficult.  
Q:  Did your parents 
have  any l ose  of

 ____________ in
 their life?  
A:  Yes .  We  had -- we were de spe r ate l y tryi ng t o 
get out of Ger ma ny.  And my par ent s r eally neve r  
had a chance.  We  had no relatives 
in Ameri ca who c oul d have  sent  us a n a f fi davi t or  a n y pl ace else  
where we could ha
ve gotten us out.  The only possibilitie
s for my parents were either to go to 
Palestine or to Shanghai in Chin
a which my fat her was a fra id he woul d not tolerat e  the cli mat e  
beca use  he  wa s s u fferi n g from at hs
ma.  Then my parent s at  least wa
nte d  me to get  out a nd I  ha d a 
fai r ly good c hance.  The direct or of t he house hol d 
sc hool i n Berli n had i m mi grate d t o Engl and a nd 
she ope ne d a  chil dren's home t here .  She  se nt papers
 to some  of us young gi
rls to come to England 
and work with her in the children'
s home , but somehow t he pa pers me
ant for me got lost.  I have a  
fe eling t hey must have b
een sold to somebody and 
by the time the director
 was a ble t o ma ke out  
ne w pa per s i t , unfort unat ely, wa s too late.  So i n
 1938 whe n I c a me ba ck fr om house hol d school a nd 
move d in wi th my pare nt s a gain th
e persecution of Jews in Berlin had become 
quite bad already and 
then later on we were forced to 
wear t he Jewish st ar.  We had t o 
take the added first na me s of Sar ah 
and Isreal.  Doctor s, lawy
ers and other professionals could no lo
nger attend to their professions. 
Jews were not allowed in the univ
er sity.  I n fact , already in '39 
we were not all o wed to go t o the  
theater, to the opera, the 
movies even.  So our life
 was very li
mited for us.  
Q:  Wh at -- were you -- did you se
e a lot of difficulties in the stre
ets or round ups,
 anything like 
that?  
A:  Well , ye s.  ______
______ ha ppened on N
ove mber 9, 1938 and I s aw the de structi on of J ewish  
busi nes s ' and Je wis h home
s and there was terrible vandalism a
nd i t was just a horrible s ight. 
Fort unatel y, some how they
 mi sse d our apart me nt a nd we wer e not
 dire ctly a f fe cte d
 by that.    
Q:  Did you hear it happe
n at  the ____
________?   
A:  Yes .  Well, heard what went 
on.  We als o, you know, i f you l i ve
d in Berli n was pretty cl ose t o  
the sports palace in which Hitler fr
equentl y spoke.  So right nearour house we had these parades of 
Hitler and his whole enteras co ming around quite fr
equently.  That was ab
out what happened in 
thos e year s.  You know - -    

Q:  Did you fe el at risk when 
you saw these para
de s c o me on?

A:  Well , you were  al wa ys at  ris k
 e specially, you know, on
ce we  start  wea r ing the  Je wi sh s t ar,  b ut - -  
well , fortunately, I -- I, personall
y, my pa rent s, we were ne ver  really
 bothe r ed t oo muc h by that.  I  
mean, we could not associate with 
Gentiles any m ore.  In fa ct, one of
 my father's br
others had been 
married to a Gentile woman 
for yea rs.  In fac t , he had c onverted
 to Chri stianit y and the brot her s  
coul d not  see each other because 
t hey wer e afraid t o be se
en wit h Jews because --   
Q:  This is a bit of a 
digre ssion, but what ha ppe ne d t o t hat br ot her?   
A:  That  brot her sur viv
ed in Berlin, yeah.  
Q:  As  a  C hr i stian?   
A:  As a Chr i stian whi ch wa s unus ual beca use I kno
w of other people where 
one spouse  was Je wi sh 
and the othe r  spouse ha d t o s u ff
er  for it  and also wa
s re port ed, s o t hat was quite unus ual .   
Q:  Was there, kind of an inwa
rd gr owt h of t he Je wish c o mmunit
y beca use you we r e so is olate d  
fr om the rest  of the city?  

A:  Yes .  In a wa y it was, of c ourse , you know, we  
mo ved to Berlin late, so 
we really didn't have too  
ma ny friends.  We  ha d r elative s in 
Berlin a nd on the outs kirt s of 
Berl in I  had an aunt  who had a  
beautiful villa in a beauti
ful suburb of Berli n wher
e I actually had spent a lo
t of my school vacation 
when we still lived in Pe
nslo.  And my mot her had 
sis t ers i n Berli n a nd s o me of us were together  
mostly with fa mily and relatives
 i n - -  in J e wish Fr ance .  
Q:  Was -- I mean, wer e there ever
 by the Jewish community to kind 
of take care of -- take care of  
each ot her?  

A:  Yes, t he r e wer e.  You know, the Je wish c o mm
unity set up a lot of op
port uniti es for us Je ws  
espe ciall y us  Je wis h youngst ers .  For  insta nc e, 
i n 1940 I  found out t hat t h e Je wis h c o mmunit y ha d 
establ ished s o me dres s making c ourse s and I  enroll ed
 in one of these courses.
  Unfortuna tely I  could  
not quite fi nish it beca us e be fore 
the end of it I was or dere d t o forc
e labor.  That was in April of 
1941.  And the forc ed labor I had to do wa s in a larg
e comme r c i al laundry on the outski rt s of Berli n .  
I had quite a lengthy train ride gett
ing there.  At that time the 
war in Europe was on and Britis h 
bombers would c o me over Ber lin pr a cticall y eve r y 
night a nd bomb Berlin.  
So we , Je wis h, force d  
labor s worked on t he four p.m. t o
 midni ght s hi ft and we ha d to so
rt dir t y laundry for the Ger ma n

ar my.  Well , on my way home a ft er mi dni ght I was usua
lly caught in an air raid
 on the train and had 
to go to a shelter at th
e Neil (ph.) station and some
ti mes I didn't get home till 
eight, nine o'clock i n  
the mo rning.  That's  how 
long the air raid lasted
.  Once in a whi l e I  wo
ul d just ma ke  it home and 
imme diately had to go into ou
r cellar which was se
t up as an ai r rai d shelt er.    
Q:  Wa s t he  wo rk  har d?   
A:  Yea h, well, we ha d t o work hard.  You know
, dirty la undr y e ha d somebody st andi ng over us to 
see that we -- we didn'
t sit still.  We  really 
worked all the time.  
Q:  I  want  to as k you t o go bac k a  minute bec aus e - -  

A:  Ok ay .    

Q:  --  be fore  you had me ntione d t o
 me that as a school  girl  --  
A:  Yea h.   

Q:  -- there was a lot of anti-
semitism in the sc
hool itself.  
A:  Yea h.   

Q:  Ca n you tell me  --  

A:  We ll, I'll tell you for instan
ce  I had a pri ma r y tea cher in my 
sc hool who wa s a s t anc h in t he  
semite (ph.) and she 
always preached anti-
semitism.  Hatred fo
r Jews.  And of co
urse that dropped 
off on the young stude nts who alr eady wer e in t h
e Hitler yout h and we re i
ndoctrinated anyway and 
there f ore  ma de li fe mi ser able .    

Q:  Wa s she me an to you?  

A:  She was -- no, she al
wa ys ma de a n exception of me bec aus
e she had known my family.  One of 
my father 's sisters had been a teacher years earlier 
toget her wit h her.  So 
she was fa mi li ar wit h my 
fami ly and she al ways
 said "Well, of course th
ere are exception and I sle i s
 one of t hese exceptions , 
but  in ge ner a l, all  J ews ar e bad and all  Je ws  are  doi
ng ba d t hings," and t his  wa s t he ji st of her  st ory.  
Q:  Wa s t hat  a reli e f t o you 
t hat you were a n exc ept ion?   
A:  No, I fel t  terribly e m barra sse d by it.  Especial
ly there wa s anot her J ewi sh girl i n my class wh o 
wa s of c our s e was  mea nt by all t his  insinua
tions  and it  made me  
feel  ve ry ba d.

Q:  Is t here a nymore, i n a  detail you c an gi ve me
 a bout the pers ecuti ons or
 what you s a w a nd hear d 
in -- in -- in the at
mos phe re in Berli n be for e you wer e deporte d?   
A:  We ll, you know, i n Berli n we re ally ke pt pr
etty much to ourselves 
except , you know, getti ng  
together with our family.  There r
eall y wasn't  mu ch cont act with th
e Gentile population.  They were  
to stay fr om us anyhow.  And well,
 you sa w that very ofte n eve n be
fore the pro bone of 1938 tha t  a  
Je wish s our c e would be  vandalize d a n d J e wish hom
es, you know, they
 we r e -- pai nte d s wa stika s on 
them and, in general, thes
e were  the t h ings  
that stand out  in
 my mi nd.    
Q:  Did people c onti nue  going t o s yna gogue?   
A:  Ye s, people did 
go to synagogue.  
Q:  So  that wasn't 
totally restricted?  
A:  No, t hat  wa s one  thi n g t hat wa
s not restrict ed at
 the time.    
Q:  And your fat her conti nue d t o wor k?   

A:  Um, my  father , no.  My fat her only got per mi
ssion to move to Berlin 
under t he re gulati on tha t  
he would not work i n Be
rlin.  That he c oul d not  ma ke a li vi
ng.  Actuall y, we had t o  live on the 
pension a nd some  pa per s, you know, 
trea sur y pa pers or t hings li ke 
t hat t hat we ha d.  So tha t  he  
coul d not  work a nymore .  

Q:  How --  did your fa mil y ha
ve fri ends or  di d the y have a n
y sense of what was coming?  
A:  Oh, yes .  We de finit e l y ha d 
a feeli ng t hat we wante d to get out
 of Ger m any des per at ely.  I thi nk  
I mentioned that be fore t hat we didn't  have a cha n ce 
to get out.  Yeah, no.  
My mother, she was ve ry 
a   

pesti ma t e pe rson, pessi mistic, and the n the ne ws of 
t he pertrat i on (ph.) st art e
d to come  a bout.  She 
suggested that we should commit suicide togeth
er be cause we woul d never sur vive  any ki nd of 
depr ecati on (ph.), but I sort of talked her out of
 it and said "Oh, you'd be
 surpri sed.  We wi ll  
manage.  We will live 
through it," and I still had hop
ed that it wouldn
't be quite as bad as the -- a s  
she had a ntic ipate d.  So t hen while I wa s doi ng t h e fo
rce d la bor and t hat la undr y in J anuary of 1942, 
the beginning of January, 
we got a notice that we 
would be resettled to th
e east.  They did not 
mention where to, just to 
the ea st.  And we were s uppos e to pa
ck our cl othi ng, be ddi ng, a ker ose ne

heater , and pos sibl y s e wing ma chin
e  whic h I ha d of cours e and wh
ic h we pa cke d, we pa cke d a ll 
these t hings and never s a w any of it agai n.  Th
en on Januar y 11, 1942 the  Ger ma n sec r et polic e  
ca me to our house a nd took us a wa y
 and they sealed off our apartm
ent which most likely later on 
wa s plunde r ed.  They took us t o a ga thering pla ce  
at the syna gogue in Berl
in where a whole gr oup 
was assembled for this tr
ans port whic h consi sted of 1,037 peop
le.  Mostly mi ddl
e aged and ol der  
people .  Ver y fe w young one s.  My
 mother  di scovere d one young gi
rl by the name of Stella.  She 
introduc ed me t o her a nd we be fr
i ended e ach other and went to t h
e fi rst part of the diplocation 
toget her .  
Q:  But did they tell you whe n you got there a
nyt hing more a bout where 
you wer e going or what  
wa s happe ni ng?   

A:  No , t he y just sai d
 " To the  ea st."   We  woul d be se
nt to the east to
 work there.  
Q:  We re they polite?  

A:  Not too polite.  I mea
n, they just out right told
 us we would be 
resettled to work
 in the east.  
Then we st ayed in that 
s yna gogue of two da ys .  We  sl ept  on th
e  floor  of course , bei n g t hat ma ny 
people.  And on the 13th of Janu
ary the Jewish communiti
es ma de sa ndwiches  for  us t o ta ke along 
on the  tri p.  And on the 
13th we we re put  aboar d a n old, 
unheat ed tr ain for  our tri p east .  
Q:  Wh at  wa s th e ge
neral  mood like?   
A:  Well , we wer e all quite de pre ss ed of c our se . 
 And on --  on thi s old train.  Our mood bec a me  
mo re s o mb e r  an d it wa s rea
lly ba d.  It was s o c ol d that e ven t h
e drinking water fr oze.  My father 
was not able to take his asthma 
me dic ation whic h had kept hi m asth
ma free for several years before 
and he suffer ed hi s firs t a sthma atta
c k  on t he tr ain to Lega (ph.) .  The n
 the a rrive d in Le ga a fter four  
days on t he train.  We ar rived at t he Ski atave (
ph.) frei ght  sta tion out side of Lega .  And we  were  
told by the SS t hat t her e wer e 
trucks available fo r the transpor
t t o the ghett o whi c h was se ve n 
kilometers away, but 
there were not enough truc
ks for e ver ybody.  J ust  for t he olde r  and infir m 
people and e verybody pe ople  would 
have to walk those seven kilome
ters.  So my father got upo n  
the tr uc k a n d my mothe r  was  first  
s tandi ng in li ne next t o me  a nd the n  she s udde nl y s aid " You 
know, your fat her mi ght  have di

was so mewhat har d of hear
ing from an acci dent in hi
s chil dhood.  So 
she left my si de and got up o n  
the tr uck wit h my fat her and that  
was the last ti me I ever saw my pa
rents.  I was barel y 19 year s old 
at the time.  So the rest of the 
group of us mar ched towar ds t he gh
etto.  The se ven kil o meter s as I  
said.  It  was  40 de gree s below 
zer o.  The snow was very
 de ep a nd it wa s ver y
 difficult to marc h 
thos e seven kilome ters .  I was luck
.  Before we were deported a re
lative ha d give n me s ki boat s and 
I was weari n g these ski boats all t hr ough my t i me i n
 c onc entr ati on ca mp.  Su
mmer and winter.  Um, 
so here every time, you 
know, somebody slow
ed down a little bit on the 
march, the SS would use 
their rifle butts and kick them in the rear to turn
 them on until we finally
 ma de it to 
the ghetto.  
Q:  An d when you go
t  to the ghetto di d a nyone 
ask "Where's my mo ther.  
Where's my grandfat her?"  
A:  Oh, absolutely.  The 
first thing I did was frantic
ally l ook for  my pare nts and so di d al l the ot he r  
people who had l e ft pare nts on the 
tr uck.  And the truc k ne ve r arrive d 
at the ghettos.  We were told 
by the  SS that the tr ucks had be en
 ta ken t o Duna me nda ( ph.) for t h
e peopl e to wor k at the cannin g  
fa ctor y.  And, i n fact , t he r e was no 
such thi ng as Dunamend
a and t he tr uc ks were ta ke n directl y i nto 
the woods which we found out only 
l ater a nd the people  ha d t o str ip 
and were shoot into open ma ss  
graves.  All this, of course, we fo
und out later.  Meanwh
ile, we settled down in 
the houses or shacks 
that were assigned t o us becau
se t he ghetto was in the wo
rse sl um area of Lega.   
Lega, a ctual ly, wa s a be au
tifu l town, but this was in a very 
bad a r ea a n d it ha d occ upie d by the  
Leucoli ne  (ph.)  troops.  It  was  a Le ucoline ghetto
 before we Germ
ans arri ved there.  So --  
Q:  They weren't 
t here anymore?  
A:  No , t her e was  n ob od y -- ye s, t h
er e were some  out  of 
-- we found out, we  we
re told that out of 
34,000 Le uc oline  Je ws, who 
had lived i n the Le ucoli ne ghett o we
re all murdered 
except fo r 4,000 
young me n who ha d oc c upati ons that  
were i mportant to the war effo
rt .  And they wer e separ ate d 
fr om us Ge r ma n Je ws .  The y were i n a Le uc olin
e ghetto what we called in
 the Ger man ghett os, 
separ ate d by wire fe nces .  There were  some gat es 
i n the fence and on week
e nds t he Le uc oline J e ws  
me n woul d someti me s get per mis sion to come over

they all told us that they had all 
lost their entire families
.  That  they all ha d be
en killed before the 
first German transp ort arrived.  In fact , we were to

tr ans port i n Nove mber of

1941, and when they came to
 the ghetto there was still -- there wa
s still food in the --
 in the houses, 
in t he ovens and on t he table.  Th
e sign t hat t he  pr e vious occ upa nts 
mu st have just le
ft before.    
Q:  But wh en you 
got there it was --  
A:  Whe n we got  the r e, no, t here were  seve ral tra n
sport s be for e  our s.  The ghetto was s e parate d i nto 
di ffere nt gr oups fr om di ffere nt pa rts of Ge
rmany and also from Au stria and some  from 
Czechosl ovakia.  Each had their own area in th
e ghett o.  And eac h school ha d thei r own te mpt  
elder s and t h e chi e f of labor assignm
ents which were Jews 
t hat  were assi gned t o
 do t he selecti on for  
the out side l abor  detail .  
Q:  So -- so t he r eal gh
ett o wa s divi de d.  The r e we re various  communiti es?   
A:  Ye ah , I me an , we were 
all t oge t her, but  di ffe rent -- i n di f fer en
t street s.  In fact
, the streets were 
named after the ar ea 
where we had come fr om. 
 There was Berli na Strasu
sa  (ph.) , Cologne (ph.)  
Street a nd al l these vari ous, you know, we ga ve t h
em the na mes of the people who were living there 
now from G er man.  

Q:  Did all of the people
 that were in the Ge rman ghetto ge
t a l ong or  that  you c o mmunic ated?   
A:  Oh, yeah.  Ye
ah.  And in the 
beginning in the ghe
tto, fa milies were still 
allowed to be together  
whi ch was a  good t hing and didn't la st all t oo 
l o ng because ever y few w
eeks ther e would be a 
selecti on -- oh, yeah.  Wh en we fir st go there I was 
assigned to shoveli ng snow
 in the sleet of Lega 
for t he whol e wint er.  That was an
 assignment.  In t he morni ng we
 woul d be e sc ort
ed out of the 
ghett o to the place of wor k.  In th
e evening we would be escorted ba
ck and always in the ghett o the y  
had gall ows set up.  And 
we wer e al ways le d by the gall ows and us uall y the r e wa s a cor pse hanging 
there .  Bei n g ha nged be caus e th
ey had bartered for some food on 
the outside which was strictly 
forbidden.    

Q:  I ' m a frai d we  are  g oi
ng to run out  of the  ta pe .  
A:  Oka y.  The  Leuc oli ne J e ws ha d prett y bad fee
lings toward us German Jews of course because 
all their fa mi lies ha d bee n mur dere d t o make room 
for us .  And t hey had lo
st e ver ybody.  So -- but 
--  

Q:  Wa s t her e te nsion bet wee n you?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273

A:  Well, I personall y didn't noti
ce tha t  muc h tensi on.  Ma ybe , in ge
neral , I didn't notice it too muc h.  
Um, t hese work det ails , the out side work det ails , 
we nt on, you know, the s e wor k deta i l s had to do 
wit h the war  effort.  You know, wor ki ng for the Ger man ar my and the -- an
d the war industr y.  And 
some assi gnme nts were rever sed 
and others, they we re always se
lection.  Ever
y fe w wee ks  we  
would be  ass e mble d a nd sent eithe r  
to the ri ght side or le ft si de . 
 One  side me ant bei ng mar ke d fo r  
exter mi nati o n.  The  ot her  side me ant  
being selected for work detail.  
Q:  Did you know that at the ti me?  
A:  No.  We -- not r ight in t he be ginning and th
en l a ter on, of c our s e, we rea liz ed what wa s 
happening every t i me there was a 
se lection a nd we didn'
t see those people anym
or e t hat had bee n  
sent t o the one side.  So we had 
a pre tty good i de a that they had be
en s ent  to the woods too a nd --  
and s hot .  

Q:  Di d you think when you
 first  got  that t hat the  ghe tto ha d be
en cleared speci ficall y  for you in  
therefore you wo
uld be safe?  
A:  I don't know if we re
ally felt that way.  It seemed that wa
y, real ly.  It see me d that wa y, but we  
were all pretty much in 
the sa me  pr edicament.  We
 all had t o wor k and as long a s we we re a ble t o 
wo rk a nd be o f hel p t o th e Ger man s we we re -- we
 woul d be  aloud to work. 
 Otherwise that was the 
end of us.  

Q:  We ll, you wer e tal ki n g a bout - -  a b out  the  se lect ions  --    

A:  Yea h.   

Q:  --  that I  t h
ink you le ar ned --  
A:  Ye ah, we learne d pre tty fast that t he pe ople who 
ha d bee n sent to one si de woul d be sent to their  
deat h.  That t hey were bei
ng taken to t he woods  and al so 
shoot into the open graves.  
Q:  Tell me a little bit 
more about how the ghe
tto bureaucracy was set up
 and what people's 
responsibilities were.  

A:  Well, like I said befo re, ther
e was -- first of all , was t he SS ghe
t t o c o mma n.  The n all his  under  
links , all our  guards.  They s elect ed
 German Jews from each school 
to ser ve a s group elder s or  a s  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273  
11 
 
chie f of la bor assi gnme nt s 
and they --  that was thei
r responsibi lity.  And t h at 
was about as far as it  
we nt.   
You know - -   

Q:  Did  t hey  -- were  th ey
 respe cte d by the - -  

A:  Oh, t here  was also ghetto poli
ce.  So me  of our young Jewi sh me
n had to man the  
gates that were 
separ ating t h e ghett os and were  us ed
 as our own inte
rnal police.  
Q:  You wer e tal king a bout t he pe ople  
who guar d t he ca mp a nd you sa y SS.  
A:  Yeah, when I saw SS
 I meant t h e Ger man SS as well as 
the Le ucoli ne SS.  And fra nkl y the 
Leucoli ne SS were e ven wor se the n the Ger ma n SS
.  They t ook -- t hey wer e real anti-se mitism.  
The y took t heir jobs ver y seri ou
sly and, you know, th
ey we re, besides t he ha ngings, the re gula r  
hangings  of people  who had bother
ed for  food -- by the  wa y, the fi rst 
transport s t hat  had come int o  
the ghett o, when t hey first came 
into the houses they found that 
the a par t me nts ha d bee n pret ty 
much pl undered.  They had be en de
stroyed.  All of the 
val ua bles ha d bee n ta ke
n out.  But once in 
awhile hi dden away some pl ace we 
would di scover a piece of jewelr
y or somet hing and t hen even  
though we had ne ver got t en our own clothi ng i n th
e ghetto t he r e wa s a clot hing depot s et up tha t  -- 
where we i ssued our clot hing and 
these things were used
 to bother on the outs
ide for food.  A pie ce  
of bre ad or whate ver we  coul d get .  Bec ause you 
coul d not li ve on the food rati ons we got i n the  
ghett o.  We  wer e  gi ve n 200 gr a m
s of brea d a  da y iss ue d onc e 
a wee k a n d ____________ pot atoe s 
and ol d cabbage leaves and fish 
heads.  And once in a 
great while a small po
rtion of horse me at  
whi ch was a great treat .  So as I 
sai d , you ha d to supple me nt your 
food through out side bart ering.  
Other wise you coul d not  exist.  So
 you ha d to ta ke your c hances of being hange d.  Someti mes one  
of our SS commendans wo
uld shoot people on the spot besi de sthe hangings.  So we had shoot ings  

and hangings all the time .  

Q:  Who were you bartering wi th?  

A:  With the Leucoline 
Gentiles that we met on 
the outside.  You know, 
when our guards weren't 
looking or s o.  And the y kne w all 
r ea dy.  They woul d see us day a fte
r da y and t hey would know t ha t  
we  ha d some thing t o give  the m
 and they brought 
us s o me bre ad or  some thi n g e dibl e.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273

Q:  Did you ever 
talk to someone on
 wh at wa s going on wh en they --  
A:  No, we coul dn't re al
ly.  First of all, we di
dn't know the Leucoline langu
age.  See, and in that  
respe c t, t he Leucoli ne J e ws , the fe w survi vi ng Le uc
oli ne J e ws  were bette r o f
f.  They knew -- knew 
the la nguage  and als o some of t h
e m esca ped from t he ghett o and j oin
ed t h e Pr otest ant s because they 
were able to speak the la
ngua ge and they could go in the countr y
 side a nd meet far mers a nd some of 
the m got  a w ay wit h it .  And later  on we found out
 t hat t he y wer e wor king with t he Pr otes tants .  
Q:  But none of yo
u were able to?  
A:  No, not really.  One of the Leucoline fellows
 once suggeste d I should 
--  he would es cape a nd I  
should come with him.  
And I sai d it  would be out of the qu
e stion bec aus e we woul d certai nly b e  
found out because I do
n't spea k t he  la ngua ge .  So 
I  turne d t hat  offe r down.  
Q:  Where  di d you li ve i n the ghetto?   
A:  Well , at  first , as I sa id, we
 lived with the group that we had 
come with fr om Berlin in these 
houses.  Some houses were
 literally like three story 
buildings.  Others were 
just shacks, but all of 
them had outhouses.  You 
know, they had no toilets inside.  
So -- well, life 
was still bearabl e  
because as I said, fa milies were
 still together except for thos
e who had been si
ngled out and -- 
duri ng the  se lections .  This ca me  la
ter on that the families
 were separated.  In
 the summer of 1942, 
that was the first summer there, there was anot
her sele ction and 50 young girl s including my  
girlfriend Stella who 
I met in Berlin, we were se
lected for a work detail at 
the Baltic (ph.) seashore. 
Thi s was the best assignment ever
.  We  ha d to fi x up for m ally Je
wish homes, Nazi  confiscated 
estates that were suppos
e to be made ready for recreati on pl
aces for high SS officials and high 
Ger ma n offi cials to c o me  there for the  -- during th
e  summer for their recr eat
i on.  We wer e house d in 
the, what for mall y must have be
en servant s quart e rs and we had no water  - -  unfort unat e ly we had 
no wat er.  We  couldn't wa s oursel ves or bat h.  So 
at ni ght  aft er dark the SS
 would take us t o the 
Baltic sea to wash ourselves.  We
 got our food fr om a 
soup kettle.  Thia was 
the most obstrense d  
(ph.) soup t h an t he food we had ha
d i n the ghett o, so we could easily 
survive on that. 
 We got bread. 
One man had been taken al
ong fr om the ghetto beside
s us 50 girls who operat
ed the soup kettles. 
So t he n we girls al so cl e ane d the 
home s for t he occ upa nts .  I , mys e
l f, had the garde ni ng detail .  So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273  
13 
 
as I sai d, t hi s wa s a very good as signme nt.  You 
know, we weren't be aten. 
 We weren't arrested 
mu ch.  Yes, we  were under obse
rvation of the S, but they pr
ett y much left  us alone.  
Q:  Ho w wer e  y ou  
c hos en for  thi s?   
A:  We ll, the comman
da nt must ha ve  looke d over  us  young 
gi rls a nd who ever  suited his fa nc y he  
thought we would do for that assi gn
me nt.  So I be frie nded fi ve of the gi r l s on this la bor detail a nd 
we decided t hat once we 
would get back to the gh
etto we would try t o m
ove toget her .  Where as , 
you know, t hey all  ha d bee n fr om 
different districts in Ge rmany an
d we had all  live d  in di fferent  
places.  So after the su mm
er  was ov e r  we  g ot b a c k 
to t he ghet to and our li f e
 went on as  usual i n the 
ghett o.  We we nt on our 
work ass i gnme nts  and as  us
ual .  The n  in -- yea h.  
Q:  Wh at other work assignme nts now?  
A:  Well, you know something.  It's
 r eally not cl e ar in my mi nd a nym
ore .   It all ha d to do wit h the  
ar my, wit h the, you know, fi xing
 up uni for ms for the ar my a nd ship
me nts , doi ng shippi ng and prett y  
-- some work was very hard
 a nd  we wer e v ery  much  
abuse d by our capt ur es.  Others were not qui te  
as difficult.  You know, th
ey were a little more leni
ent and so that wa
s a little easier to handle.  But 
all this time our life wa
s in consta nt danger .  Fi
r s t of all because of the 
bartering and a chance of 
being hanged or shot.  A
nd secondl y, because of t he 
constant selections.  We 
wer e afrai d  to get sick, 
of course .  Whic h ha ppene d to me a nd -- in t he e a
rly fall of 1943 I got ver y 
sick.  I got jaundice a nd 
hepatitis.  And I was put into th
e ghetto hospital which was set up
 instead by a Ge
rman inmate 
doct ors  and nurs es who wer e i n t he ghett o wit h us
.  There weren't many me
dicat ions availa ble  for  
us, but over some wee ks  I got better .   Never re all y
 regai ne d my strengt h, but the y dis char ged me  
aft er se veral wee ks .  But I was t oo we ek to go on 
outsi de a ssi gnment s, s o I -- oh, by t his  I for got to 
me ntion.  When we ha d gotte n back
, the si x girl s from the - -  fr om 
the work commander at the Balti c 
sea, we  di d move  toget h er
 int o a ver y old shack at the end of 
the  ghett o t hat ha d bee n  unoc cupied. 
So we wer e under t he j ur i sdicti on 
of the Colon group.  So
 now, when I wasn't ab
le to out on outside 
work detail I talked to th
e  chie f of the labor assi gnme nt a nd t ol d
 hi m of my predi c a me nt and he s a id  
"Oh, I tell you what.  
You can help my older daugh
ter Lilly who has to take
 care old my six young 
children because my  wi fe
 goes outside to work to 
bring i n some food
 fo r t h e fa mi l y."  
 We ll, this for

me  was  gr ea t.  I e njoye d being wi
t h t he c hil dren.  I enj oyed bei ng 
wi th a fa mil y b
ecause I hadn't had 
a fa mily in all this time .  I live d with my frie
nds there i n t h e, you k
now, in the s ha c k, but  the  
daytime I spent with my friends ther e.  
Q:  Thi s j ust  brings up a  questi on
 be for e you were  gone .  Ther e wer e 
a lot of children in
 this ghetto?  
A:  Yes, at that ti me 
there still were a lot of
 children until later.  
Q:  We re there activ
ities for the kids?  
A:  Yes, they did have 
activities for the children.  
I'm really not too clear on 
that.  I think they did 
have some s chooling and some pl
ay groups, you know, wher e olde
r youngsters took care of the  
young c hildren.  A
nd I 'm reall y not  too cle a
r anymore, but there were
 some activities for the  
children.  

Q:  Were there activ
iti es for t he r est  of t he people?  Were
 t h ere vocational courses or was t here 
religious activities?  Wa
s there any culture?  
A:  Well, any religious activities w
ould have to be held in the vari
ous apartments.  You know, there  
wa s no -- no syna gogue -- not hing of that kind a n d th
ey were held in secret.  Services were held, 
you know, t here were s o me Orthodox
 Je ws ther e  who held s e rvice s in the i r apart me nt and invite d 
some ot her Ort hodox pe ople t o parti cipate i n the m.  I under s tand t hat the r e onc e in a whi le was a  

concert.  You know, I wa s neve
r part of it  and I really wa
sn't  personally there.   
But  I 've hea r d that once  i n a while t he r e were  so
me per f or ma nces.  You kn
ow, some  of our  ghett o  
inmates still had some, I don
't know how they mana
ged to get instruments 
unless they found them 
in -- when they got
 to the ghett o.  Yo
u know, l e ft be hind by the  Lacli ans .   

It 's quit e pos sible bec aus e eve r yt hing had bee n ta
ken a wa y fr om us .  You kn
ow, any kind of jewelry 
had been ta ken away from us .  Als o
, fur coat s.  Everyt hi
ng, you know, and that 
was al l se nt bac k t o 
Ger ma n y for, you know, for use  th
ere.  An d, you know, as I said, e never saw any of our own 
clothi ng a nymore.  Only, yo
u know, i f it happe ne d  to be
 in the clothi ng depot.  
Q:  So  what -- after you came home  fr om 
work in the evening 
wh at did you do?  
A:  We ll, we  ha d --   

Q:  I'm sorry.  One second.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273  
15 
 
A:  Well, in the evenings of co
urse we cooked our meal s fr om th
e me ager rations that we had and 
sat around t he di nne r ta ble and had convers ations. 
 We had found s o me books i n the  apart me nts  
fr o m the Leu c olin e Je ws we were 
r ea ding.  But we we nt to be d prett y earl y bec aus e we worke d ver y  
hard  a nd  we wer e  
very tired.    
Q:  Do  you reme mber any of thos
e conver sati ons  a nd the  types  of 
t hings  you woul d talk a bout?   
A:  Well , a c tuall y, we r e mi nis
ced more about our chil dhood and 
about the good times than we 
wanted to dwell on the hard time s that we had t here .  Wh ich actuall y bec a me worse l ater on.  Wel l , 

anywa y, whi l e I was hel p ing my frie
nd Lill y t o ta ke ca re of these younger childr en I  ha d a rel aps e  
of my he pati tis and t he ja undice a nd I  was ta ken back
 to the hospital.  This 
was in the later fall of 
1946.  And I  was i n the hospit al ag
ain for several weeks and improved 
t o s o me ext ent , but rea lly not 
enough to be discharged.  So 
one day my girl fr iend Lill y who ha
d visit ed me re gul arly at t he 
hospital, came by _________
___.  There was no vi
siting time and she called 
me at the window and 
said t o me  "I 'm very gl ad t o 
hear t hat you're comi
ng out of the hospital
 tomorrow."  We ll, I 
understood immediately what that 
message meant and I told the doc
tor, the chief doctor in the 
hos pital , t hat  I would be leavi ng the  hos pital  the  ne
xt  da y a n d he sai d " Not  with my per miss i on. 
You are in no condition to be releas
ed fro m the hospital."  I said 
" With or without 
your permission  
I'm leaving."  And so here I was barely able to sta
nd on my fe et, but I  le ft t h
e hospital the next day. 
It so happened t hat  Lill y's fat her , t he chief of la
bor det ails , ha d gotte n wi nd of t he fact  that  ther e  
would be a -- that the hospital w
oul d be evacuate d.  All these  people
 would be s ent a wa y to t heir  
deat hs a nd t hat 's why he  had t old his  daughte r  to 
warn me of that.  So I came out.  This was in 
No ve mb er of '4 3.   I came out 
of t he hos pital and sur e e n ough a  fe w days lat er the hos pital  
populati on was taken out and put t o 
de ath, but all the other ghett o inma
t es ha d to st and for selecti on .   
And this ti me not onl y were the infir m pe opl e taken 
away, all the older one s who we re left a nd ther e  

were not ma ny of them, but mo thers 
wit h young childr en.  Al l young 
children were put to one side 
and we wer e  aske d at what plac
es we h a d wor ked .  An d I o f co
urse have not -- having not had 
wo rked on the outside, li
ed that I had been wor ki ng at t he Av
iar (ph.) whi ch was t he a r my cl othi ng 
depot.  Ot he rwis e, it would ha ve mea nt dea t h for me 
too.  And luckily I got aw
ay wit h  it.  I wa s p u t  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273

-- put on t he  right side.  So all these mother s wit h
 the young childr en got take n away t hat ti me t o  
their death.  
Q:  Whe n you s ay that  t h e hos pital  wa s e vac uate d - -  

A:  Yeah, well --  

Q:  -- did you know whe r e the se 
people were -- I me an, what happ
ened?  How did 
you know wh at 
wa s goi ng on?   

A:  Well , we  ha d a prett y  fairly 
good idea that it didn't 
me an a nyt hing good.  That t he y  we re me ant  
for de ath be caus e, you know, t her e were pre vious sel
ecti ons in the ghett o.  
So we had a fairly good 
idea and my  girlfriend Lilly actua
lly saved my life by 
getting me out there in 
ti me.  Otherwise, I  
certainly wouldn't be around anymor
e.  So now, this me ant, this 
was  No ve mb er '4 3,  th at mea nt t he  
end of the Steliga  (ph.)  ghett o.  
All the ghetto inmates that were 
left were sent t o concentrati on 
ca mp, Kisa vold ( ph.), out side of Le
ga .  And s o me of the m sta y ed ther
e fo r work details there.  Most 
of us were se nt t o out side  install ations  wh
ere  we were house d a t  our work pl aces .   
So I was sent to thi s Av
i ar (ph.), to t he ar
my cl ot hing depot where  we we
re housed i n barracks that  
had double or triple  bunks wher e 
we slept and we  we re give n a me
s ket ( ph.) a nd a 
cant een and we 
worked t here taki ng care of t he cl
ot hi ng for  the ar my.  Sort ing it.   

Shipping it out and all these 
things connected with it.  
Q:  Ho w ma ny of you we re there?  

A:  Yo u know, I don't really
 recall .  There were quite
 a  fe w of us.  Ma ybe a  100
.  I ' m r eal ly not  sure.  
Q:  Yo u wer e n 't  in  Ca mp  Ki
sse rwal ( ph.) wer e you?   
A:  No, I wa s lucky.  We were
 onl y process ed in Ca mp Kiss er
wal.  Now, all these outside  
installations were under the jurisdiction of Ca mp 
Kisser wal .  So the -- the food there, agai n, we got 
soup t hat was made wit h potat o peel
s and we got s o me brea d.  It was 
sufficient, but just  barely so. 
That  we  coul d j ust live  on 
it and do our work.    
Q:  We re you wit h t he ot her girl fri end t hat yo
u ha d bee n li ving wi th?   Di d t hey ma ke it?    
A:  No .  In t his p a rtic ular  wor k
 detail I was not with any of my fr
iends.  Th ese were all other whom 
I met in the ghetto, bu
t nobody t hat I  wa s re
ally friends with.

Q:  We re you pretty stro
ng or  di d you fe el --   
A:  Well, I r eally 
wasn't strong yet because 
I hadn't fully recovered fro m
 t he -- fr om t he jaundice 
and the hepatitis, so I was quite week
 yet.  But I mustered all my 
strength and did my
 work.  Then,  
this was fr om Nove mber '4 3.  July
 of '44 we were still 
working there.  Even 
other people had other 
work, outsi d e detai l  wor k det ails , but all ha ving to 
do with t he ar my.  I n  Ju
ly of '44 a dele gati on 
ca me fr o m Ca mp  Kis s er wa
l and Viver man ( ph.) had our  hai r  ___
_________ off.  So now we were  
all bal d and we wer e gi ven pri son
 cl othing.  The n in August we 
we re s ud de nly a
sse mble d and ta ken 
away fr om our work pl aces and we
 wer e put on frei ghters of barg
er s ( ph.) you mi ght call them.  
Open barger s.  Pre sse d i n like sa rdi n es.  You know
, tha t  ho w man y o f u s  wer e  ther e  and we wer e 
being s hippe d out again.  
The conditi ons on these barger s were t e
rrible.  I mean, we were just laying 
one on top of another.  We  bare
ly had a little water to drink and it
 was just horribl
e conditions. 
Now, on the barge I was very l u
cky.  All of a sudden I found my
 girl fr iend Lill y a nd t wo ot he r  
friends from the ghetto, Margaret
 (ph.) a nd Gert a who were sister
s a nd wh o were t h ere wit h th ei r  
mother .  And all  of 
a sudden t he four -- t he fi ve of us, act ua
ll y, wit h t he mother , wer e toget her a n d 
fr om that mo ment on the fi ve of 
us were together until our liberatio
n actually.  So we
 were happy to 
have found e ach ot her on the bar ger s.  The tri p on 
the bar ger took thr ee da ys and t ook us to the por t  
of Dansic (ph.) or ____________ 
as it was called in Po
lish.  And we were sh
ipped to Camp Stito f 
(ph.).  Now, Stitof --  

Q:  How much i n for mati on -- di
d you know where you were going
 or  why you were  going?   
A:  No, we had no idea.
  The y j ust  put  us  on t he  fre i ghter  a nd --  

Q:  Had you at this point  had a ny inf or mati on a b out the war?   Did you have a se ns e of what was  

goi ng on?   

A:  Well , so me ho w we s e nse d tha t
 the -- the war wa s not goi ng to we
ll for the Germans.
  That's why 
they ke pt shi ppi ng us  from pla ce 
t o place and that  the 
Russians mu st have be
en coming closer.  We  
sens ed t hat .  We di dn't r eally k
now for sure, but we sensed t h at. 
 So when we sa
w Stitof, it was a 
horri ble  sight.

You know, t he chi mneys  were s moki ng and the s me
ll was li ke stuck yards.  And we i m me diat ely 
thought that if we had to
 stay the re we  woul d ne ver  make it  out alive .   
So --  

Q:  What  di d you see  whe n 
you we nt i n ____________ t oget her , pe opl e i n t h ere?   
A:  Well , we  saw other peopl e be hind -- there wer e di
fferent sections in Stito
f.  They had di fferent  
areas all separated by barbed wi
re where di ffer e nt pe opl e fr om ot
her c a mps, I gues s, had bee n  
asse mble d.  And l ucki l y we were kept together  in
 one area be hind bar bed wire .  And we didn't sta y  
there long.  I think we we
re there only maybe a week
.  Not even a week, so 
we  were  v e r y l uck y.   
Q:  So  you weren't wo
rking or  anythi ng?   
A:  Not at Stitof.  We we
re sent away to work deta ils.  So luckily my fo ur 
girlfriends and the mother 
and I were s electe d toget her.  We we re all toget h
er a gr oup of 1,
000 women who were
 sent to the 
Poli sh c ount r y side whic h ha d bee n take n over 
by the Germa ns to dig tr
e nches for t h e Ger ma n  
ar my.  

Q:  We  st opped whe n you had 
ride fr om Stotif to the   
____________ side, but I wa
nted to ask you to go back a little b
it more to the Raga (ph.) ghetto and 
maybe tell me a little 
bit more about the lifestyl
e in there and whether you 
had social life, whether 
you worke d ever yda y, whether 
you c elebra ted hol idays.  
A:  Yes, first of all, a lot of the Jewish girl
s be frie nde d the Le ucoli ne Je ws  who ca me over on the  
wee ke nd to be wit h -- wi th us gi rls.
  And as a matter of fact some -- some of them later on after the 
liberati on married t hem because, I 
mean, most of these  fell ows  had 
bee n pr eviousl y mar r ied a nd ha d 
lost their fa mily.  But we
 had -- there als o we r e, of c our se, boyfri ends , girl frie nds in the Ger ma n  
ghett o, you know, t hat we

e njoyed eac h othe rs c o mpany a nd t h e 
Leucoline fellows would come  over
 and we would social ize t oget h
er .  We would get  toget her  in 
groups of t wo coupl es, three coupl
es in somebody's ap
a r t m ent we woul d get t ogether.  And, i n  
general, e njoy e ach ot her s  compa ny 
and e njoy t he  day of

Q:  Oh, you had a  da y off.

A:  Well, ye s.  We had a  day off 
from wor k.  That 's on the weeken

Q:  So that you ha d t he fre edom

the Le ucoli ne ____________ whe n  
the Ger man ____________.  

A:  No .  We Ger ma n Je ws were  n ot al lowed  to  g o
 to the Leucoline ghettos 
and I think the Leucolin e 
fel l ows had t o get s peci al  per miss i on to come ove r  
to visit in the German gh
ettos.  Wh ich they got 
quite  re adil y.  

Q:  Di d the  Leuc oline J ews get any kind of fa vor
ite treatme nt in terms of
 work as si gnme nts or  
freedom?   

A:  Well, I believe that their wo
rk as si gnme nts wer e better beca use 
they had special skill s that were  
nee ded for the wa r e f fort.  Tool 
maker s and what ever other tools  th
ey had t ha t  ca me in ha ndy for t h e  
war effort and for t hat reason I be
lie ve  that they ha d pre f erre d t r eat

Whe r eas we j ust

Q:  Wh at were the di ffe

did you fe el a s  
a women?  

A:  No , l ots  o f ti me we wo me n 
were treated just as 
rough as the me n.  Of 
c our se , we ll, so me of  
them might have treated some of
 the young girls a little bit better, 
maybe, than they 
would have men 
or ol der wome n.  Whi ch appli es al so to the SS.  Y
ou know, s o me of t he Ger m
an SS sort of favor ed 
some  of the Ger ma n  girl s  an

Q:  We re t he r e gi rls t hat  you kne w wh

A:  Well, I personally didn
't have that experience
.  I mean, my girlfriend
 Lilly and Margaret and 
Gert a a nd mysel f, we didn't ha ve t hat experience.  
My friend St ella wh o I had met in Berlin on the 
trans port  be friended a Leuc oline  Je w and lat er on a f

A:  Yea h.   

Q:  And you wer e house d  --  

A:  Well , there were house and ba
rr ack t here behind barbed wire an
d we  we re a sse mbled .  Lik e  I  
said, a 1,000 wome n were 
picked out for this work detail.  Not all of us were fr om the German  
ghett os .  We  had Je wis h wome n th
ere from Lacli a , fr om Lit hoania 
and Ist o nia (ph.) .  All the three  
di ffere nt countrie s.  All  the countri es.  So here  
we were in the Polish co
untry si de  assigned t o  
digging the t r enc hes .  We  were hous
e d in a woode n tent wit h high -- te
nts .  Like circle t e nts.  Round 
wooden pl y wood te nt
s.  100 women to each tent in two laye
rs.  One layer of st
ra w on the gr ound, a  
plank, a wooden plank, a nd a not her la
yer of st ra w for the s ec ond laye r.  50 on the bottom a nd 50 on  
the top.   

We wer e ea ch given a horse bl anket.  That 's th
e onl y wa y that you c an c all it and, of cours e, ther e 
wa s no light, no heat
.  Nothing.  I n t he  be gi
nning it was summe r.  We  wo
uld di g our  dit c hes  and we 
would all, i n  the mor ning, we woul
d first shovel a seat for Mar garet
 a nd Ge rta 's moth
er so that she 
coul d sit down i n t he gr een a nd we war ne d her 
when t he ga urds were c o
mi ng cl os er to look bus y  
and shovel t he earth.  We 
-- we girls would work harder t o make 
up for her part of
 the work and we  
really dug t h ese drenches which be
came ver y di fficult i n the winter 
because we fir st had t o loosen 
the ice and snow with pick axes be fore we even ge t 
-- c oul d get  at t he earth.  
We also built barbed --  
barri ors across t he r oad t hat were 
suppose t o st op the Russi an ar my
 from a dva nci ng.  Now, i n our  
tents  her e i n this plac e we were , al so we  were gi
ven very meger rati ons.  
We  got t he s oup ea ch da y 
that was ma de out of potato pe el
s a n d ___________
_ and ca bba ge lea ves  and thi ngs like that , and  
really unsufficient for the 
wor k e w were doing.  So at night, in
 the dark, we youn
g gi rls, t wo a t  a  
ti me , we wer e four , we woul d sne ak out into the fe
ilds and steal  turnips and potat os .  The  turnips we  
would e at ra w and the potatos of course you c o uldn'
t eat raw so we once in awhile -- while were 
able to make a fire and bake so
me poatos in the fi re.  We had,
 occa ssi onall y we ha d SS guards who

were a little more leaniant and who looked the other wa y and let us get away with that.  So that was 
a speci al treat when we had baked potatoes.  In t h
e -- in the t ents we -- we were infected wit h lice 
and there were mi ce or rats r us
tling around under the 
stra w and we 'd never  
forget any of them 
beca use a s s oon as -- as i t  got light they got a way 
and s o we li ved wit h this
.  Pe ople got  sick.  The r e  
wer e so many that di ed.  That I 
think at the end of this work de
t ail out of 1,000 
wo me n ma yb e there  
wer e 100 le ft.  Not more than t hat
.  ____________ for it and dyse nter y 
and they just died off.  I got 
sick t oo.  I had -- I had intesti n
al pr oble ms  too.  My legs we re co
vered with open boils that were 
oozi ng pus s.  And I felt pretty ba
d, but we got t h rough this a nd th
e mot h er of Mar gar et and Gerta 
got through with it. 
 And this lasted fr om August
 of '44 till January of '45.  
Q:  Had, in this period of 
ti me, did you l earn a nymore a bout wh
at wa s  going on in the outsi de  
wo rld?   

A:  Ye s, we had hear d th at the war was n ot g oin
g well for t he Germans and 
that t he Russians were  
coming close.  So in Ja
nuary of 19 -- of 1945 a
ll of a sudde n we we re as se
mbled and we starte d on a 
deat h marc h.  The SS wante d to get  us c l os er 
back t o Ger m any towar ds 
Ger many.  So her e we  
mar che d.  Had we  st aye d i n Lega or iginal ly we 
underst and t hat Le ga wa s 
liberated i n '44 alr ead y 
and I  thi nk i n October of '4 4, so ma ny mor e of us
 woul d have stayed alive, but t he Nazis al ways  
took us a st ep furt her closer towar ds Ger many an

death mar c h a nd marc hi ng  
day and night and all of us were really sick.  My 
girlfriend Margaret was de

An d, you know, I also had diar

And whoe ve r wa sn't a ble

 we mar c hed thr ough sever a l ni

SS fi nall y let  us  sta y over night i n a  ba

rn.  And wh en we  
woke up the  next morni n g, I believe
 i t  was Januar y 21st of 1945, our
 SS guards were gone a nd we  
wer e suddenly fee or so 
we t hought, but our j oys  wer e s hort l i
ved.  We  move d on by t he ti me --  
there were just the five of us 
toget her.  Maybe  a fe w othe r wome
n were wit h us  at first , but  
eventuall y there were just  the fi ve
 of us.  We went on bec a us e  in 
the barn there was nothing to eat 
for us .  We  l ooked a n
d found a not her  deser ted far m h

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273  
23 
 
the first thing was to kill
 the chickens and 
ma de chic ken soup a nd ga ve i t  to our  frie nd Margaret  
who I ' m sur e  woul d not  have sur viv

 found some canned cherr i es in 
the cel lar of t he far m house and 
she ate a whole jar of the sour cherri es and t hat r e
ally cle ane d her out.  And from that day on sh e  
started to get better.  No
w, two days  aft er the SS 
had left the Russian soldie
rs started t o march in, 
but they never really liberated us
.  We were  just a  ha nd
ful of wo me n and we  to

And al so -- t hey were a f t er us , yea h, t he s oldi ers wer e

They we re a l wa ys tr yi ng

Al l four of us ma naged t o get

She woul d t r y -- try to t alk to t he m.  We le arne

Q:  It must have been fr ighten

___ with the Nazis to be
 liberated and still be 
fi ghti ng for  your li fe.  
A:  Yea h, se e we never had any -- we  never got a ny 
paper s because nobody reall y liber ated us.  I t  
wa s plai n Russia n s oldie rs who mar c hed i n.  Who 
had no a ut horit y to gi ve us any pa pers or who 

didn't even believe that we were Jews.  So we we
re  suppose t o go to a town c alled ____________ in 
Poli sh wher e they ha

the Russian war co mmandant was 
suppose to give us instructions 
what to do further.  Now, we 
had hear d si nce there were wome n

they wer e consta ntly a ft e r us.  And, s o we tri ed

s o ldiers ____________ of 
Nunmar k (ph.) .  And we mar che d a r ound the Polis

worked in the fi elds sometimes a
nd s o we found one plac e a ft er the

chur ch a nd t his went on for five months.  Five 
mont hs we str uggled t hr
ough thi s and me anwhile,  
you know, I  always  thought  
comi ng bac k t o t he r apes , atte mp ted

leave me al one because if they woul d see my legswit h all the puss runni ng out 
of the sores that they  
wouldn't be  intere sted i n me, but t hat never w

____________ our sel f wa s,
 you know, being --  hidi ng a wa y or
 some  other wa y, but that woul d  
have never s t opped the m.  
Q:  We re there any wo me n soldiers
 or  Je wish s oldi ers a r ound?   
A:  Occ asi onally we ha d a Je wis h mentor , but we 
ne ver sa y a wome n sol dier, but we had, once i n 
awhile we had a Je wish soldi er who, of cours e, t old
 the ot hers to leave us alone.  And that also 
save d us.  So, you know, a fter t h
e s e five mont hs, pra cticall y fi

__________ the y  had school

s o me milk and potat oes  to eat. 
 You know, and ot her ti me s t h e  
far mers  would gi ve us  food for  wo
r k that we di d for  th

Russian authorities after us, but we
 also had the Polish 
militia (ph.) who 
was looking for us too.  
And, you know, the Po

They are known for that.  So by 
t his t i me we alre a dy fi gur ed it di

 We  girl s helpe d one

Q:  Thi s  wa s  whe n?   

A:  This  wa s in  J une  o f

Took care of us

mother by this time had 
a very bad cold a nd wa s 
real ly sick, but  we di dn't  reali ze how serious i t

ghett os whic h ha d bee n de molis he d by then and a f te
r a whil e we de cide d it wa s ti me to move  on a n d  
we wanted to try to get back to 
Germany.  So with another piece of
 gol d fr om Lil l y we got on a trai n 
to Berlin and in Berlin we were 
some of the first refu gees coming
 ba ck and t he y ha d just se t up a  
Jewish relief center.  And that 
was opposite the Jewi sh hospi t al. 
 And Mar garet and Gerta 's mot her

She had _________
___ a nd eve n though 
she got  good tr eat me nt

 Berlin.  Whic h was ver y s ad beca use  
after all she had gone through, three 
years of concentration ca
mp, fi ve months of wandering thr ou
gh Pola nd, s he made 
it all the way to  
Berli n a nd t hen past  a wa y.  And t h
e hospital and the relief
 center wer e located 
i n t he Briti sh sector  
of Berlin.  We  met some 
British soldiers and they 
gave us money to bury 
the mother.  I knew the 
large Jewish cemeter y there and th
at 's where we burie d he r.  So me
anwhi le, we had st ayed at the 
relief center across fr om the hospita

set  up they ha d not hing reall y 
to give  us.  The y ha d no clot hing

 Out of which I sewed

in Berli n.  There must ha ve been
  Nazis livi ng there who had fl ed 
a nd we ll, we ma de ours elves at

Berli n a nd he tol d me he want ed
 me to stay in Berlin wherea
s I had intended to go with my  
girl frie nd t o Levi tt (ph.) , but he convi nce d me that  
it would be better for me to
 stay in Berlin since I 
was entitled to fo od ra

my other benefi ts we
re two days where I 
had ____________.   
So he  re nte d  me a 
furni s hed room and t he girls  tr ied t o get  
back t o t heir  homes 
in the west.  On a  
Briti sh tr uck, you know, Briti sh ar my .  But the fir s t ti
me t he y c oul dn't make  
it.  They got  stopped by 
the Russi ans at t he boarder and were
 sent  ba ck.  So all  of a sudde n 
t hey appeared i n my furnishe d 
room, my furnished room again and 
we spe nt t w o mor e  da ys toget her
 and then they 
made a second  
attempt.  This time the British so
ldiers hid them among 
barracks on the trucks 
and they made it t o  
the west .  They ma de it to Margaret and Gert a '
s house whi ch was still found 
i ntact i n  their home 
town.  And our fr iend Lilly stayed 
wi th th e m.  S o  we  were al wa ys i n c ont act with  o ne  ano t her .  I  
had to find myself a job.  I ha d to earn a livin
g and I absolutely
 did not wa nt to
 work for any 
Germans.   I fi gur ed they were all Nazis and 
I ' m c e rtai nly not goi ng t o  
work for them.  And I 
ma na ged to fi nd mys e l f a job with 
t he Ameri can ar my that  was sta

where I ha d my furnishe d home .  I go
t a job t here in the offi ce.  That
 was the quarter 
master 's suppl y 
people wher e all the American t ro

the supply.    
Q:  ____________.   

A:  Ok ay .    

Q:  You ha d gotte n a j ob i n Berl

A:  Ri ght .   Yea h.  At this ar my ba se  I was the on

who ha d be friended Ame r ican s oldie r s a nd wh

to this job.  So --   
Q:  What  di d that  se e m li ke?   

A:  It didn't  ma ke me fe e l  ver y 
good, but t hat 's  the  way i t  was  a

s one Je wish ma n 
at the ba se who wa s pl a y

ano for the soldi ers.  A
nd he c a me over to me 
one day and said " Ar e you the Je wis h 
girl that just returned
 fr om concentration camp.
  It's the talk of 
the town that there's a Jewish girl."
   I said, "That ' s me .  I 'm t h e one
."  He said "You
 know, we have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273

quite a few Jewish soldiers.  I'll in
troduce you."  So he did.  He  intro
duced me t o the 
Je wish soldier s  
who were r e ally wonde r f ul.  I mea
n, here t he s oldiers were not supp
ose to give us a nyt hing.  You 
know, us e m ployees  at t h e ba se, but t hey al ways 
ma na ged to give us , you know, i nsta n t coffe e a nd 
soda and cigarettes.  And, you 
know, it wa s very good beca us e, I 
mean, all the supp

wer e ver y s h ort ____________ ration.  But I c oul d 
eat at t he ar my base, but
 _________
___.  Now, 
the Jewi sh soldier s had servi ces Fri d ay ni ght at t h

along for the servi ce. 
The y ha d as ked me i f I wa nte d to go and I said ab
solutely.  I would like to
 attend a servi ce.  And 
every Friday night they wo uld take me in thei
r army vehicle a
nd take me to the ____________ 
where we had a Jewish servi ce.  
After the services there was a Je
wi sh family in Berl in who had 
lived under ground, meaning they 
had been hidden by German ge
ntiles all during 
the war and wh o 
had come  ba ck t o their 
home wh ich had not been destroyed, wh
ich, by t he wa y, I  found out t hat  the  
house t hat my pa rent s a n d I had l i

the gr ound.  Y
ou know, when I c a me back I  
sa w it bomb ed to t he gr ound whi c

______.  That  
wa s never ____________.  Anyway, 
we came to this open house an

____________, you know, re fuge es 
or people who ha d lived under gr
ound a nd ha d ve ry interes ting 
disc ussi ons group a nd s ocializ ing at
 their house ever y Friday night.
  Whi ch made it very pleasant ,  
you know, very nic e esca pe.  Then 
i n -- when was it -- in April of 
1946, you know, me a nd my ot her  
fel l ows  were  wor king at  t he --   
Q:  Where  were you li ving at  thi s poi nt?   

A:  I  ha d a furnis he d r oom.  

Q:  You wer e basica lly al one .  

A:  Ye s, I was basi cally alone.
  I  ha d a fur nis he d r oom not 
too far fr om the army base.  
Q:  Did you -- were -- di
d you have any family?  
A:  No, none, I me an, at  that ti me only later on di
d I get in contact with my
 Uncle.   Besides from 
this Uncle in the Gentile 
and -- and t h eir family.  I really didn't 
have anybody ther e.  I be fri ended t h e  
Je wish fa mil y who re ally took i n like  I was t heir 
own c hild.  That was als o
 a mixe d marriage, but  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273

they had suffered persecution.  
The Gentile husband had been take
n to a concentration camp for  
awhile.  So they treate
d me  very well and tr
eated me like fami ly.  
Q:  What  about  your  rela tions  
wit h t h e Ger ma n pe ople  in Berli n
?  Wh at kind of response?  
A:  Well, of course, none of them
 ever admitted that they ever had 
been Nazis.   Of course, there 
wer e no mor e Na zis ar ound, you know
.  As far a s that wa s c onc erne
d the y all lie d, but, of c our se , 
ever y -- ever y person at  t he age t hey coul d have b
een Na zis .   Yo u kn o w, I ' m s ure t hey  wer e  Nazi s  
be for e  and a side fr om s o me of th
e gi rls that I worked wit h at  th
e ba se I r eally didn't have muc h  
cont act.  As I said, all my  spare ti me I spent wit h 
this one Jewish family th
at  had be friended me .  So 
one Friday night in Apri l  of 1946, 
this Jewish fa mily told us that
 the y ha d obtai ne d questi onnaire s  
fr om the American Joint Distributio
n Commi ttee  t o a ppl y for visas t o
 go to the Unites States for us 
-- for us, mostly girls who 
ha d ret urned a nd some fel l ows t oo.  
Some  fell ows who re
gularly attended  
these open hou ses.  An d I, even
 though I  was  not t hat  anxious  to
 go to America because I had 
nobody there, but I knew I 
couldn't get to Pale
stine (ph.)  at th
at time, so I fille
d out the form to 
appl y for a visa .  And t o my greate st sur pris e, 
several weeks later I was 
called to the America n  
consulat e a n d they que sti one d -- i n fa ct, I ha d gott en
 -- I  ha d j ust ar rive d a t  my office  at the  ar my  
base.  I had not even had my br
eakfast yet when I received a tele
gr am fr om the Joi nt Distr ibution 
Committee telling me to co
me to the consulate.  
So I immediately went to
 the consulate and I was 
que stioned t here t he whole da y.  M aking s ure I was r
eall y the person I clai med 
to be .  I  had by t his  
time , I can show it to you later,  I had a little thing like 
a passport stating I wa
s a victim of fasisim 
(ph.) and at t he end of the day they
 finally bel i eved me a nd it di dn't 
take that mu ch lo
nge r then I got  
my vi sa.  Through t he ge nerosity 
of President Tr uman who had all ocat
e d visas for t his
 place  per son. 
From - -  it was a c o mple t e suppl y and sever al wee ks 
late r ther e  in Ma y of 1
945 -- '46 e x cuse me .  I 
was sent to Bro mine (ph.) to the 
port of Bromine on my  wa y to Amer
ica.  So I first notified my  
friends that I was comi ng to Br
omi n e and all thr ee of them, Marg
aret, Gerta and Lill y came t o 
Bromine   We were housed there in the British ca
mps t he y  ha d s et up and 
we were  hous ed ther e 
four wee ks before we le ft  on a sh
ip.  And my girl f r iends spe nt the 
whol e week with me there whi ch 
wa s a bsol ute ly wonder ful .  We  ha
d a great ti me t o gether.  And the y
 saw me off.  
On the 14th of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273  
29 
 
May 1946 we wer e put a boar d a liber ty shi p.  It 
was, you know, a for mer 
Ameri can tr oop tr anspor t, 
the marine perch.  And we were 
put  aboard the ship on
 our trip to America.
  Now, it was quit e  
primitive of course.  Being 
an army ship we had trip
le -- triple bunks, but I 
really spend no time in  
the bunk at all.  I spent 
t h e whole ti me up on deck because dow
n below you would on
ly get sea sick 
beca use e ver ybody t here got se a sic k, so I sta yed on
 top a nd our whole gr oup 
had a wonder ful ti me.  
We wer e on the shi p for 10 da ys and we were s upp
lied there by the sailors 
wit h fr esh food whic h t o  
us wa s a  real  novelt y a nd I was  ne
ver  sea sick, so I  could enj oy all 
t he good foods that t hey offered  
me  a nd ha d r eally a gre at ti me .  
Q:  Did you know --  di d you have a n y fri e
nds on this boat be fore you - -    
A:  No, none of my frie nds -- we
ll , not real ly.  The y were mostl y
 not from my ca mp.  There we re  
di ffere nt people who had just c o me ba ck t o Berli
n, but no, I don't rec all t hat
 I met anybody from my  

camp.  

Q:  We ren't you a little nerv
ous about taking this larg
e trip all by yourself?   
A:  Oh, cert ainly.  Oh, c ertainl y.  And I had nobody 
in -- in Ameri ca.  It was a big undertaki ng --  
taking, but I certai nly wa sn't  goi ng t o 
stay i n Ger m any.  That I coul dn't 
do.  I coul dn't sta y ther e.  So  
we all wanted to get out. 
 My frie nds  wa nte d to ge
t out.  So when we spot
t ed t he Stat ue  of Li bert y 
as we were close to New York that
 was the biggest thrill 
of my life .  So we 
landed in New York and  
the Joi nt Dis t ributi on c o mmitt ee was  there to gr e et us and the y put us up i n a hote l  and the y took 

care of us.  And what th
ey had i n mi nd wa s they wer e going t o
 se nd, there  wer e 
quite a fe w young 
girls a mong us a nd t hey had i n mind to se nd us 
young girls out of Ne w York beca us e they figured 
we woul dn't  be a ble t o get j
obs  in Ne w York a nd e ve n, you co
uld eve n ge t hous ing or eve n a  
furni shed room was di ffi cult to come
 by.  It was s hortl y a fte r t he wa
r when all the so
ldiers ha d come 
back, so they tried to pl
ace the young girls with Je
wish fa milies all over th
e country.  You know, to 
be baby sitters, household help to
 Jewish fa milies and for some r
eason I was absolute
ly determined 
to stay i n New York.  I don't -- I don't  really kn
ow why.  I had nobody the r
e.  The onl y thing I had  
wa s my -- my Je wi sh sol die
rs from my army base in Berlin had 
given me a d dres ses of t h eir fa mili e s  
in Ne w Yor k wh o m I c onta c ted  a
nd this somehow made me feel I 
wanted t o st ay here and even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273

though the Jewish co mmittee told me
 I probably wouldn't be able to
 fi nd a job in 
New York and I 
wo uldn't find accommo dations in 
New York I ma na ged t hr ough thes
e cont acts t o find mysel f a  
furni she d r oom.  I al so f ound a job a s a sea ms t re ss 
and so  then I wa s on my  
own.  You know, I - - I  
move d int o the fur nis hed room and I  started a li fe
 on my own being a st ea m 
stress.  Now, in the 
me anti me ,  my  healt h,  o f c our se
, had been per mane ntl y i mpair
ed t h rough all t he year s of 
concentr ation camp and wanderi ng around i n Poland
 and I  had thi s se rious i ntest i nal pr oble m. 
Al ways pain and diar eah and so, 
whi ch was  later on diagnose d as __
__________.  So 
that made it  
very di fficult .  I mean
, I  we nt t o wor k a s a  se a ms t ress .  I we nt
 to wor k e ve ryda y.  I  di dn't  even miss  
work e ven when I was  runni ng a 
fever , I we nt  to work.  And 
thi s we nt on -- me anwhil e, my  
girlfriends Margaret and Gerta were
 still at their home in the west
.  My girlfriend 
Lilly had fo und 
two of he r brothe rs, t w o older brot her s wer e aliv
e and she found them back
 in Colon and they ha d 
gone t o an Uncle i n France and t hey 
were living in France at that time.  Now, um -- I'm stuck.  I had 
-- yea h, s o a year a ft er I had gotten t o Ameri ca, i n
 fa ct, i n June of 1947 I 
me t my futur e  hus ba nd at 
the s wi m mi ng pool .  I forgot to 
mention, my fri ends Mar gar et and 
Gerta came to Ameri ca a year  
aft er me.  They had an Uncle in
 Chicago and they settl ed i n  Ch
i cag o.  S o mean w hile , I met my 
hus ba nd int o  the end of June of 1947 and three 
mont hs later  we got mar r ied be cause  he had ha d 
si milar experiences t hat I 
ha d e xce pt  that  he  ha d come  to Amer
i ca j ust  be for e  t he war, but  he  us  
never able to get his parents out 
and his parents and young
er sister were also 
killed in concentratio n 
ca mp.  So f or our we dding i n Oc
t ober, my gi rl friends Margaret 
and Ger t a ca me  to c e lebra t e our  
we ddi ng e ve n t hough t he y wer e here  onl y s uc h
 a  s hort  ti me  and had 
just started jobs.   
But t he y ma naged to c o me here a
nd it was re ally wonder ful .  So, I 
mean , we were a b
l e  to fi nd, my 
hus ba nd a nd I got a base me nt a part m
ent.  You know, a part me nts we
re ver y har d to c o me by a n d  
starte d a ne w li fe.  I continue d on 
se wing.  You know, worki ng as a 
sea m stress.  He had come bac k  
fr om - -  fr om the servi ce.  He was in t he American
 ar my and he was worki ng 
in the post office, so 
we got  settl e d in for a ne w li fe.  And the onl y dr a w 
bac k was t hat I was si c k 
so mu ch.  Th
en in 1949 
our s on was  born a nd a f ter that my
 ____________ reall y got bad. 
 Even worse than before and 
whi l e he was  quite young yet I was i n
 and out of hospit als a nd that ma
de it, of course , quite di ffic ult

for my  husband.  He  had 
to go t o work a nd ha d t o ta ke c are 
of t he chil d after wo
r k.  He got s o me  
fr om cousins and from friends wh o he
lped out, but in general, it was 
quite difficult.  
But all in all,  
we  ha d a good li fe.  And so, yo
u know, we  can't complain.   
We 're ver y happy that we  ar
e here i n t his country a nd were a ble  
to start all over again.  And in the 
me an ti me t hen  ju st a bo u
t t hree  ye ar s ago t o ad to my ot her  
ali ment s I got a ver y sever case of  
shingles in my head an
d my eye and because of 
my  i mpa ired  i mmu ne  sy s t
em through all the year s 
of c onc entr a tion ca mp I coul d neve
r get over  it.  I ha d -- 
I suffer ed a sever ely
 da ma ged ner ve t hat  
leave s me in const ant pai n and, 
but you have t o put up wit h it.  
You know, life goes on.  We have a  
very c l os e re lationshi p.  We ha ve a 16 year old gr
anddaughter and we have 
a very cl ose  relationship 
with our fa mily and so
 life is good.  
Q:  I'm going to ask you 
a few more questi ons.  
A:  Ca n you turn on t he a i
r condi tione r or  s o methi ng?   

Q:  Do you wa nt t o t ake  a br eak 
fo r a couple minutes?  Ok ay.  We 'l

A:  Yea h.   

Q:  Did you think 
t hat you woul d sur vi ve all of t his ?   
A:  Well, I te ll you, we were hopi
ng.  We didn't thi nk wi th a cle ar 
mi nd.  We  were hopi ng we woul d 
survi ve.  In fact, when we were in
 the se wooden t ents  doing our la st 
work detail  in Pol and, at  ni ght, 
you know, we -- t here wa s no li ght  in the te nt 
or anythi ng, we would l ay down a n d we woul d 
re mi nis ce a n d ma ke belie ve we  were i n our c oz y 
living rooms at home and 
the mother of Mar garet  
and Gerta woul d ____________ us t h
e stor y of he r ne ws and how she 
had spent time at the English 
fi nis hing sc hool , so we kept oursel ve s alive .  In
 fact, when we wer e di ggi
ng the trenches we were 
standing on top of a mountain wh
er e we dug t he t r ench we would si
ng.  So we  would a l wa ys tr y t o 
look on the  bright  si de and hope we  woul
d survive it.  Never re
ally believing it.  
Q:  What  do you t hink ga
ve you t he  st rengt h?   I  m
ean, you wer e a  young gir l
.  You wer e all al one .  
A:  Yeah, well --  

Q:  What  do you t hink 
got you thro
ugh this?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0273  
32 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 I just had the will to 
live.  It's as simple
 as that.  So after 
my husband and I were  
mar r ied alr e ady as I sai d, my girl fri ends Margar
et and Gerta  lived in Ge r ma ny i n we st Ger ma n y  
until they came to the states.  Our girlfriend Lill
y immigrated from France to Pa
lestine.  Th
at wasn't 
quite Australia and she met a youn
g ma n that be ca me a doct or and 
who is a pr ofessor in medical  
research and they still live in Israel
.  And we four girls have kept 
in contact steadily over all these  
more tha n 50 year s.  We  telephone e ach ot her .  
We get toget her once in aw
hile.  Even when Lilly  
from Israel has been here on any -- 
a n y number of ti me s an
d then we try t o all four get t oget her a nd 
re mi nis ce about the old ti me s and th
ink how good we have it now in co

gone on bet wee n our fa mili es 
now for all  t hese years.  
Q:  Yo u guys have
 quite a bond.   
A:  Ye s, quite a bond. 
 We are very cl ose.  
Q:  We re -- wer e ther e ot her people who, I guess ,
 didn't s ur vive by helping 
each other a nd who were  
-- I mean, -- well, I 
gue s s  what  I ' m a s king i s  wa s  ther e a  di
fferent  sense of moralit y at that ti me  
being t hat  pe ople  were  str ugg
ling so hard to survive?  
A:  Yes.   Yes.  I mean, you fou
ght for ever y pi e ce of bre ad, for 
eve r y, you know.  And it ma de it  
very har d.  You know, people did fi ght with eac
h other and whi ch we ne
ver di d.  You know, we  
always -- she had every bit that we
 had and that s ave d us bec a use I '
m s ure none of us woul d be alive 
toda y i f we had not ha d this cl os
e bond a nd -- a n d di d e ver yt hing toget he r  and s hare d  ever ythi ng. 
All our experiences.  All 
our  food.  Everythi ng.  
Q:  Ho w i mp ortant  wa s re ligio n t o
 you through out 
all of this?  
A:  Well, I still believed 
in God even though it was 
very difficult under the 
circumstances to believe
