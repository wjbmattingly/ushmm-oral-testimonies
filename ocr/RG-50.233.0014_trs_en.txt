Okay.  Could

bit about your life
, your childhood, 
and your life before th

The only thing I remember
, I was a happy 
child, I had a ve
ry good life .  
My father was not
 too rich but weal
thy and I had ever
ything what I  
needed. 

 

What was your fathe
r's occupation? 
 

He had a store, a textile store. 

 

And where did you go to school? 

 

My first elementary 
school was in Janina.  As 
I said it was a city with 
30,000 people an hour 
from Preveza and 
I was in a French school, 
Alliance Israelite Universelle.  An
d afterwards when 
I finished that 
I came back to Preveza a
nd I continued 
high school. 
 

The elementary s
chool, so then it was 
an all Jewish school? 

 
 
 
2
 
Yes, yes. 

 

Did you study Jewish s
ubjects there also? 
 

I studied French, 
Greek, and Hebrew. 
 

And history and all the 
other subjects as well? 
 

That's right. 

     

Was there a Zionist orienta
tion from this school? 
 

I don't think so, I don'
t know.  But the only th
ing is that all the  
children in this school
, they are very good 
educated in Heb r e w  
language.  We don't speak, but we 
read-we learn every
thing about the 
holidays and we kept 
we had a good    
                  17.  
 

Well, was this a 
large Jewish commun
ity?  What do you remember about 
the Jewish community? 

 

From my city 
or Janina? 

 

From your city. 

 

My city, it was a very 
small community, about 
300 people.  But Jani na 
has 3000.  And that wher
e I stay my elementary 
school, and after that  
I came back to Preveza 
and I continued in high 
school but it was not  
Jewish. 

 

Well what was your home 
life like?  Could y
ou tell me about your 
brothers and sister?   

 

Normalfamilylife.  No 
excitement.  I said, sm
all city and you can't 
do crazy things there b
ut it was very.
.. it was very normal, easy life, 
easy life really. 

 

Did you live in a ho
use or an apartment? 
 

In a house. 

 

What was your house li
ke?  Was 
it large? 
 

Five children, can 
you imagine if 
it was large? 
 

Well, either all five 
children lived in
 one room ..your bedrooms. 
 

No, not that. 

 

Is there anything you ca
n describe to me, about wh
at did it 
look like?  
I assume it was very bea
utiful there. Greece is 
a beautiful country. 
 

 
 
 
3
Itis 
a 
beautiful 
country.
  But 
I 
said, 
the 
Jewish 
community 
in 
my 
city, 
it was very small. 
 But still we kept the ho
lidays.  Wedo
n't go ever y 
Saturday 
shul 
like 
wedo 
here 
but 
we 
usedtogo 
Yom 
Kippur, 
Rosh 
Hashona,  
Pesach, and Sukkoth
.  The most important ho
lidays we 
were there. 
 
And the Sabbath, you 
kept the Sabbath? 
 

We kept the Sabbath not in 
shul, though, 
in the house.  My mother          
31 cook supper.   
              
             
     32.  She would 
prepare everything 
from Friday.  
That's why, I still 
dothat.  Friday 
is the cooking and 
cleaningday.  ButSaturd
ay is nothing.  This  w e  
kept the day of rest. 

 

So your father didn't
 work on 
Saturday? 
 

Oh yes.  In the 
beginning, no.  In 
the beginning, no
.  But after a 
couple years becaus
e life was harde
r, everybody sta
rted to open the 
stores Saturday, so my 
father did too.  But, in
 the house it was n o  
work at all. 

 

Could you tell me the names of
 your brothers and sisters? 

 

Yes.   

 

And their ages? 

 

Their ages? 

 

Well, what appro
ximate year th

  Then Albert, 
then third it's 
me, my sister... 
 

What is her name? 

 

Rachel, Rachel. 

 

And then my youngest brother, Joseph. 

 

And did you all have th
e same schooling?  Did 
they all attend th e 

 
 
 
4
Alliance school? 
 

No, not in Greece because 
they are too young 
to go there.          
46 then it was in Ital
y, the oldest one.   
 

The oldest one went 
to study in Italy? 
 

Italy, yes.He left nine 
years old, he went in Italy. 
 

Oh so he spent all hi
s high school... 
 

When he came back, he di
dn't need to go to scho
ol here in my hometown. 
 

Was he in Na
ples, then? 
 

Yes, Naples. 

 

In a Jewish school there? 

 

No.  Convito Nazional
e Vittorio Emmanuele 
 

So, a public institution? 

 

Yes.  But, he would 
sleep over there.
  Mygrandmother
 was living  i n  
Italy at this time in Naples.  But sh
e goes to visit 
him every week, 
every Saturday or Sunday, I don't
 know, but he stayed there. 
 

But he ultimately ca
me back to Greece? 
 

Yes, when he finish
ed school he came b
ack to Greece.   
 

And what did he do then? 

 

He was working as a--n
ot secretary, what can 
I say--he ke
pt the books 
from one electric 
company.  Account. 
 

And how about Al
bert?  He was 
working also? 
 

He was working with
 my father in th
e store, Albert. 
 

And Rachel, was she 
still in school? 
 

Yes. 

 

Now, could you tell me, di
d you have any ho
bbies or interests as a child  
that you liked to do? 

 

Like what? 

 

Oh I don't know--artistic thin
gs or music, did you play--? 
 

I used to play my litt
le mandolin(ph)59 but when 
the war came, I forgot 

 
 
 
5
about everything else. 
 I would only read a 
lot, knit and crochet, 
sewing...these thin
gs I used to do an
d because this is
 things I can 
doin 
the 
house.  My 
father 
didn't 
believe 
the 
girls 
togo 
work 
outside. 
 
 

Oh really? 

 

Yeah, they have to 
stay in the house,
 so these things
 I used to do. 
 

What about getting to
gether with friends,
 did you do that? 
 

Yes, a lot, a lot with f
riends, almostevery day. 
 

Oh, really? 

 

We used to go to their 
house, they used to co
me to my home, we used 
to go walks outside.
  That's all, but not in
 parties and 
things like 
that like here. 

 

No? 

 

No, no, not like that. 

 

Was this boys and gi
rls or just girls? 
 

Mixed. 

 

Mixed.  

 

We were mixed 
with friends of my brothers. 
 

Did you have friends 
who weren't Jewish? 
 

Yes, I say that because the
re were not a lot of 
Jewish people there.  
 

Right, so...? 

 

Two.  Two Jewish gi
rls and the others
 were gentiles. 
 

What was that like?  Did you experie
nce any anti-sem
itism as a child? 
 

No, no, none at all.  The
y were very friendly 
and very helpful and 
everything.  NoIdidn't
, that's true.  I don'
t know the Greeks they 
didn't show anti-s
emitism before the 
war.  Thishappen edafter.  This  
happened afte
r the war. 
 

So you said you liked
 to play the mando
lin (ph)73 and you 
liked to read.  
What types of things, 
was it European literat
ure in translation into 
Greek or was it Greek? 

 

Greek, Greek books.
  We had no 
library there. 
 

 
 
 
6
Classical Greek authors? 
 

That'sright.  Only
 Greek, nothing else beca
use I didn't speak fluent 
any other language and I
'm not interested to re
ad something I wouldn't 
understand. 

 

But it wasn't like 
a famous author tra
nslated into Greek? 
 

No, we don't have 
any libraries over 
there to find the 
books we needed. 
 

So, it was a very small town. 

 

That's right. 

 

Did you, at that time did
 you travel in any othe
r places in Greece,  
had you been to other 
cities or anything? 
 

Only Janina and one 
timeinAthens.  Itoldyo
u my father, he was very 
strict, what can I say,
 he didn't believ
e that the g
irls had to go far 
away from home.  They had to stay 
home until they 
get married.  But  
after the war, I went ev
erywhere you c
an imagine here. 
 Being in th is 
country, I had more fr
eedom. I went to  
California, Hawaii, Isra
el, east and west Europe,
 even Birkenau and 
Auschwitz. 

 

What about your moth
er, you haven't talked mu
ch about, what was your 
mother like? 

 

My mother comes from 
a big family, eight child
ren, four boys and four 
girls, and she w
as the oldest.  
So, she used to hel
p my grandmother  
work at home.  She 
was a real house
wife woman more th
an anything else. 
 

Was she educated? 

 

Not too much.  You know
 those years, th
e woman they never had highe r  
education.  If they fi
nished elementary
 school, it wa
s a big thing. 
 

But she could read? 

 

Oh, yes.  Even my grandmother, s
he used to read.  
Though she had 
cataract in her eyes she u
sed to read the small 
little romance books, 
something like that
, to pass the time. 
 

So your family comes from 
the Sephardic tradition? 
 

Oh yes.       
     [WE HAVE 
DISCOVERED SINCE THE 
INTERVIEW THAT  
   THISISNOTSO] 

 

Is there anything specif
ic that you woul
d like to tell 
me about tha t  
type of a life, were there 
observances that you did? 
 

Well everything what t
hey should do for holid
ays, Rosh Hashonah, Yom 

 
 
 
7
Kippur, Pesach, 
everything we did 
much better than here
 I can tell you. 
 
You did have a synago
gue in your town? 
 

Yes, I did.  One, but 
it was enough 
for the people th
ere really. 
Janina had more synagogue
s because there 
were more people.  But the 
holidays they kept 
very good.  When 
Rosh Hashonah, Yom 
Kippur came you  
feel 
the 
holiday,you 
felt 
that.  Here 
you 
don't 
feel 
the 
RoshHashon ah  
coming because no
body around shows.  Only w
hen I go to syn
agogue, then  
I know is holiday.  Ev
en Shabbot now.  I feel o
nly when I go to shul.  
I realize that.  Here, 
I don't see nothing. 
 

Yeah, it's di
fferent. 
 

But still, after my husb
and passed away, almo
st every Saturday I a m  
there. 

 

Well, it's impor
tant.  Werether
e any Jewish youth 
organizations in 
Greece? 

 

Janina they had because
 there were more peop
le over there but i n  
Preveza, no. 

 

So you weren't 
involved in any of that? 
 

There were not t
oo many people. 
 

Did you ever help your 
father in the store? 
 

Well, yeah, once in a whil
e but only if they ne
ed extra help, that's 
why I went, but not too mu
ch because there were tw
o.  Mysecondbrot he r 
and him, they manage ve
ry good.  I told you the
re was not big city and 
the business is no
t so big so th
ey didn't need 
extra help, but  
sometimes. 

 

Was this town, is it
 near the water? 

 

Yeah. 

 

It is? 

 

Yes, swimming. 

 

So you went to the se
ashore all the time. 
 

Swimming all the time. 

 

In the Aegean 
Sea, which sea 
is this?  
 

IonianSea.  No,Idon
't--it's Sagul (c.) 107 
is a gulf, Amuzakikos  
Gulf, is a gulf 
it's not sea. 
 

 
 
 
8
Okay. 
 

Is 
the 
Ionian 
Sea 
outside.  But, 
this 
is 
a 
smallgulf, 
Amozakikos 
Gulf. 
 

Is that walking 
distance then to your house? 
 

Oh yes.  All over the ci
ty is walking distance be
cause it is so small.  
But it was a very nice walk 
all through the city, you know. 
 

Was it mountaino
us in this area? 

 

No, not too much
.Janina has mountain
s.  Janina has a lot
 of mountains.   
Snow and cold in 
the wintertime. 
 

Oh really? 

 

Oh yes.  But Preveza, 
it has humidity rather th
en cold, and a lot of 
rain. 

 

Sort of a Medite
rranean climate? 
 

Yeah. 

 

What did the buildings 
look like?  Did they
 have red clay roofs? 
 

How can I say these thin
gs? they put one on top 
of the other ones an d 
till... 

 

Shingles? 

 

No, not shingles.  I 
don't know how to c
all them in English. 
 

The clay, the red clay... 

 

Yeah, like clay, one t
he top of the other th
ey put like that. 
 

And were the building
s white usually? 
 

Most of them, most 
ofthem.  Youdon'tsee 
dark like her
e.  No,no, 
all paint. 

 

What about your house? 

 

My house, white. 

 

White house.  Did 
you have any pets? 
 

One dog. 

 

You did.  What was 
your dog's name? 
 

Matzil. 

 
 
 
9
 
Maztil?  Hebrew? 

 

I don't know how we
 got this name, Matzil, bu
t he was over
 there when 
the Germans came to pick us up. 

 

So, you left him. 

 

Couldn't take him with 
me, who can 
do that? 
 

Matzil in Hebrew means to 
save, lahateel(ph)125.   
 

Really? 

 

 

Yeah, matzil is the
 word they use for a lif
eguard in Hebrew.   
 

I didn't know that. 

 

So, maybe it had something to do with that. 

 

I don't know.  My
 father and my mother, they
 call him Mathi
le (ph)127, 
I didn't ask where th
ey got this name. 
 

Okay.  Nowmaybe,isthereanything
 else you can re
member about your 
childhood that you coul
d tell me, about your sc
hooling?  Whatabout  
your high school? 

 

Myhighschool 
was 
inmy 
hometown, 
in 
Preveza.  That 
is 
where 
I 
finished 
the high school, there. 

 

So, it was an academic pr
ogram like a re
gular high school?  It wasn't 
a technical school? 

 

No, no, it's a 
regular normal
 high school. 
 

Like a public 
high school? 
 

Yes, but I think the pub
lic schools over there 
and the high
 schools 
especially were higher than here
.  They had more su
bjects and subjects 
like they have in first and
 second year 
of college.  
 

Yeah, 
it'smore 
intensive.  Defi
nitely.  It 
was 
like 
a 
gymnasium, 
kind 
of? 

 

Yeah, it was called a gy
mnasium over the
re.  There,theydon'tcall  
it high school. 

 

Right, so it w
as a gymnasium. 

 

Yeah, but the last 
two classes, seven
th and eighth, th
ey had so hard 
subject.  Like I sa
id, first or second 
year of college. 

 
 
 
10
 
Like physics...? 

 

Physics, and mathematics,
 algebra, geometry, an
d everything else. 
But here I see nothing of
 that kind, no, only wh
en you go to college. 
 

Right, they like to 
play in high school. 
 

That's alright, tha t's all right. 

 

Carefree.  So,beforeth
e Nazis came did you ha
ve any knowledge or had 
you heard about the Na
zis or anything that 
was going on in... 
 

Well, I thought they
 would be stuck ov
er there in Germa
ny and I didn' t  
know they were going to
 start dispersing all ov
er Europe little by 
little.  Weheard 
about Polish pe
ople but they used to 
say that Polish 
people they are a li
ttle harder to the
m.  Theydidn't 
go along good .   
And the Polish 
they hate the Germans.  So
 I said we ar
e far away we 
don't have nothi
ng to do with them.  But 
we didn't realize that one  
day they were going to come
 to us; they p
lanned to come to
 Greece too.  
We didn't realize 
that.  And in the meantime, 
we didn't hear
 anything 
what happened over th
ere.  Everybodyusedto 
say, if they will take 
us to Germany, they are 
going to put us to wo
rk until the end of the 
war 
and 
thenwewill 
come 
back.  I 
saidalright, 
we'll 
goto 
work, 
fine, 
I don't care.   

 

So that's what they told you? 

 

Yes. 

 

So, do you remember when
 the Germans invaded Gr
eece and came to you r  
town? 

 

Sure I remember 
that, my God! 

 

Could you tell me 
what it was like? 
 

How can I explain when I saw the fi
rst soldier or t
he first officer  
with this dress?
   We'rescare
d to death beca
use we know wh
at happened  
to Poland and the othe
r countries after that.
  I though
t something 
would happen to us 
too but it's nothing we c
oulddo.  Inthemeantime 
they obliged us, a
ll the Jewish people,
 to go every da
y, every morning,  
in the police and 
give our presence to saywe are here...to be ready 
topickusup 
any 
time 
they 
wanted.  You 
understand?
  So 
we 
didn't 
have 
any choice and we coul
dn't escape in the mo
untains because small 
mountains were close to
 the city.  
But we ha
d all the people in the  
house, my gran
dmother, my f
ather was not 
so well, and we 
couldn't leav e 
them and go the mountain
s.  Andtheycouldn'tfo
llow us over either. 
For myself I could have
 a job in the mountains
 and teach Greek to the 
village girls but how 
could leave my
 family and go there?  You 
understand?  Itwasterriblesituat
ion for us and 
for my parents too 
because they couldn't
 move so easy.  An
d     175myfathersayswhat 

 
 
 
11
happens will happen
 to all of us.  So we 
accept our fate,
 all of us. 
Just to be together, so we 
could help each other. 
 
 

When was this? 

 

This was '43. 

 

What month?  Was it
 in the winter? 
 

No.  I think it was th
e same time, March, some
thinglikethat.  And  
one year later 
exactly, they pick us up. 
 

So they had been occu
pying for a year? 
 

Yes. 

 

Were your businesses open? 

 

Yes. 

 

They were and we were allowed to work. 

 

Until the last mome
nt, the last day. 
 

Did they beat you in the stre
ets or anything like that? 
 

No, no.  I forgot to tell you.  Six 
months before we had...six months  
before we had the Ita
lian occupation. 
 Yourememberwe
 had the Italian 
war then.  When the Italians left, 
right away the Germans came.  And 
they started restr
ictions.  NoJewsallowed 
to go out at nighttime and 
we had to wear the 
star of David in 
ourarm.  Wedon'
t have th
e right 
to go to movies.  We do
n't have the right to 
go outside nighttim e, 
everythinglikethat.  SoIthought 
it was temporary.
  Isaiduntil 
we will be free and they
 go we have to accept this
 life, we couldn't 
do nothing else.  In t
he meantime you couldn't ta
lk to them, they had 
such a wild lang
uage nobody  
knew German to this time and
 you couldn't 
talk to them.  But really
 they were mean, very 
mean.  Iremember,the 
worst part, they brought pr
ostitutes in my home. 
 

Really? 

 

Yes.  And my father
 and mother were so scared.
  Myselfandmysister 
went to a friend's house,
 a gentile, to sleep 
this night because they 
didn't want us to 
be in the house. 

 

You mean the Germans were 
sleeping in your homes? 
 

They came in our homes y
es, but this time...  
 

And then they broug
ht prostitutes. 
 

 
 
 
12
That's right, they did s
leep nighttimes but in 
my home they brought  
the prostitutes for
 a night.  But another hou
se, they kept the whol e 
house.  They throw the pe
ople out and they stay 
in the house.  Don't 
say what happened then. 
 

So you then couldn't ima
gine that they were 
going to deport you? 
 

No!  Theonlythingbot
hers me why we were 
obliged every day to go to 
the police office and sa
y that we are here.  They 
know that we are no t 
going anyplace, they knew 
that.  See,thegirls 
in this time and this 
city 
they 
arenot 
sofreetodo 
whatever 
they 
wantedto 
do.  Their 
lives 
wereveryclosed.  You 
had to go certa
in time and cer
tain place. not 
too late, you know.  Wi
th them, too different. 
 

When was it that th
ey deported you? 
 

25th of March. I can'
t forget the da
y.  25th of 
March, 1944. 
 

 

That was late in th
e war really. 
 

Late in the war?  I thin
k we were the last count
ry occupied from  th e 
Germans.        213 We had so
 dark, we didn't k
now nothing what  
happened outside f
rom our home.  It
's unbelievable, t
hat.  Iremember  
we had a cousin in At
hens who was 
more in touch 
with the situation that 
used to write to us. 
 "Our cousin is very sic
k, we pretend  
    21 6  
that the situation 
is so good.  We have to
 try to take 
him somewhere 
to get well."  
These people in A
thens they escape in
 the mountains,  
they hide with our fri
ends and they we
re saved.  But we
 couldn't do 
that because in my hometo
wn there were so 
few Greek, or 
Jewish people 
and the people...  (the city) was 
so small, every
body knew us . 
Wherever we go, they woul
d recognize righ
t away.  But in 
Athens which 
was bigger city you co
uld hide.  Nobody know 
if you are Jewish or 
Gentile.  Inmyhometo
wn it was difficu
lt to do that, that's why you  
couldn't hide.  But for 
me it was so easy to 
go to a small village and 
teach Greek.  So be bu
sy over there and go far 
away from home.  But 
I couldn't do that, I co
uldn't leave 
my family. 
 

Can you tell me then what
 happened...when you we
re deported
 and where 
you were taken and wh
at happened then? 
 

Yes.  I 
told 
you 
two, 
three 
o'clock 
in 
the 
morning, 
1944, 
25thofMarch, 
they knock on our door. 
 Right away, I 
said to myse
lf, "Oh, the 
Germans".  And I realized that 
because I heard t
he walking in the 
streets, you know, the boo
ts.  I said to myself,
 the Germans.  And in 
the meantime, no li
ghts in the hous
e.  The lights 
went out.  The 
Germans start to scr
eam to get re
ady and pick up wha
tever you can, an d 
go.  No, we were so ner
vous.  Canyouimagine, 
from the sleep, sleep, 
wake like that.  What can
 I take in the 
dark, no lights 
or nothing.  
Sowetookwhateverwe 
could.  The 
only 
thing 
myfather 
and 
my 
brothers, 
they took some money 
in case we need 
wherever we go.  So,
 we went, they  
took us right away 
downtown near the 
city,port.  They
 had already the 

 
 
 
13
cars over there 
already.  Onebyon
e they put in the 
car.  That'sall.   
And who couldn't get in 
the car because 
of his age, they had to push 
him.  So, they took us to    2
40  another city. 
 We passed 
all the 
cities        
241 to go to Athens
.  Ineveryplacewe
 stop they pick 
up the Jews from  th
ere and they put in the cars.     243 they 
concentrate all the Jews 
from these smal
l cities and fr
om Athens too, 
and from there they de
port us to Birkenau. 
 

In trains? 

 

In trains, in _____
____ trains, not 
passenger trains. 
 

So you were all tak
en to Birkenau? 
 

Yes. Were you toge
ther with your fa
mily at this time? 
 

Oh, all of us. 

 

And how many days did 
it take to get to... 
 

It was eight,
 nine days, I think. 
 

Did you have food? 

 

Food.  They put us raisin
s, I remember.  But we 
had some food 
with us.   
I don't know how, 
what.  Wekept   
   250knownothing.  Andsleepit 
is out of question.  One 
on the top of the other 
one.  I was so happy 
when I arrive to Birken
au because I thought th
at at least we g o  
someplace to wash ours
elves, to take a 
little fresh ai
r.  Boy,what  
a disappointment when we
 arrive over th
ere.  Justdown 
in the pavement  
where the train 
stopped, there 
were German officers.
  Andtheystart, 
" Left, right, left
, right, left, right".  
We don't know what this 
meant.  We find out 
later what this means, "le
ft, right".  One is for 
concentration camp,
 and the other is for crema
torium.  Wedidn'tknow 
that.  When we arrived over there,
 we find some Jews 
from Greece, from 
Salonica(ph)259, who went to 
Birkenau a yea
r before us. 
 

Oh, really? 

 

Yeah.  Myhusband 
was a year before
 me there.  So, 
we ask them, wh at 
happened to our parents, 
where they are?  Oh, 
yes they say, they were 
so calm--forget abo
ut your parents, 
you look for your
self now.  I 
couldn't believe t
hat.  Icouldn't 
believe but he sa
id to me, you will 
believe, when you will s
ee the crematori
um.   One hour later, the 
flames from the cremator
ium are alrea
dy up.  
 

What happened to your br
others at this time.  
Were they selected to  
work? 

 

Yes, they put them to wo
rk, all three.  They 
were young, 
they didn't 
keep people over 45 and 
under thirteen or some
thing like that.  All  
of them under and over 
went to the cr
ematorium but my
 brothers were 

 
 
 
14
young 
and 
healthy 
and 
they 
could 
work.  Look 
overhere, 
this 
way.  This 
one was eighteen, sevente
en, I don't know 
how much he was.
 He was very  
strong boy and the other o
nes too, so they put th
em to work.  But th ey  
had lousy job, that's why they went
 so fast.  All of t
hem, they worked  
in the crematorium.  They
 put them there.  A
nd you know wh
at the job 
was in the cre
matorium.   
 

To unload the bodies? 

 

No. To put them
 in the flames, 
in the oven. 
 

Oh, they went to th
e crematorium? 
 

That's right, they worked
 over there and the w
hole job is to put the 
people in the oven, put in
 the oven.  After they
 kill them with the 
Zyklon B .  They take th
e bodies and put over th
ere.  They 
had another  
commando, I can't re
member the name, who took 
thegold  teeth,whocut 
the hair and things
 like that, and then 
they put them in
 the oven.  I t  
was a terrible job to do 
that's why they couldn't 
stand a lot on the 
job, it was depressing. 
 And my oldest brothe
r, we used to have  
correspondence on
ce in a while wh
en he find people wh
o work in Birkenau  
they used to send us so
metimes packages from 
there and letters.  An d 
they used to say we ha
ve everything here but t
he job we are doing is 
terrible.  Herearenicepeopletha
t he knew from Greece and he had 
to put them in 
the oven.   
 

What did you do?Wh
at was your job? 
 

Iwas      286.
  I change a hundred jobs, 
not only one.  The first one 
was dig ditches, make something like 
that.  And I di
dn'tknow.  I 
didn't know how 
to touch the shower.  And a
ll my hands w
ere bruised   
289 the German soldiers, 
they used to laugh be
cause I didn't know to  
do the job.  After that
 they changed me, th
ey put me to work in other 
things, but not thin
gs that I can do as woman.
  Men'sjobs
.  Iworked 
almost until November. 
 I got the job 
from March unti
l November.  
After that we tr
ansfer to Ravensbruck 
and Malhoff   295. 
 

Oh, you went to Ravens
b r uck ?                  
 

Ravensbruck and Malhoff 
    296.  Two more, 
the last two months. 
Over there, they put me
 work nighttime.
  Make caps 
for pistols. 
 

Oh really? 

 

And it was terrible job 
too because I couldn't k
eep my eyes open the  
whole night.  I was so 
terrified to hold 
that gun and thi
ngs like th at .  
And for what? to kill our peop
le.  That's it.  That's.. 

 

When you were going thr
ough all these camps a
nd everything, were you 
with other Greek Je
ws at the time? 
 

Girls.  Yes, there 
was a bunch of gi
rls with me, yes. 

 
 
 
15
 
How 
didyou 
communicate 
with 
the 
other 
prisoners 
or 
did 
you 
communicate 
with them at all?Because I 
assume--you knew French, right? 
 

Yeah, 
but 
I 
didn't 
seeany 
Frenchpeople 
there.  The 
onlything, 
you're 
not going to bel
ieve.  I met over there 
in Birkenau, one girl from 
Poland who didn't spe
ak Greek, who didn't sp
eak French, who didn 't 
speaknothing 
else 
besides 
Jewish 
and 
Polish 
which 
I 
don't 
know.  Fir st  
time in my life I heard 
Jewish language over th
ere.  InGreecenobody 
speak Jewish. 
 Even the rabbi do
esn't speak Jewish. 
[Yiddish] 

 

Right. It's an Ash
kenazic language. 
 

That's right.  We di
dn't know that.  But th
is girl, we 
 attached 
because we had bought th
e shovel and not come in
to ____, (c.315), not 
at all, got friendly.  I 
mean, to--a litt
le bit together, that's a ll.   
When I came back al
l of a sudden, I saw her h
ere in Whitelo
ck (c.316) 
Street with a child
 in her hands. 
 

In America? 

 

Yeah. 

 

Really? 

 

Yeah.  I 
didn'trecognize 
in 
the 
beginning.
  First 
of 
all 
after 
so 
many 
years, everybody c
hanged from 1945 '
til '51, everybody
changed.  What 
is____?(c.319).  Ithou
ght my God, this girl 
I know but I couldn't 
find where I remembe
r, from where.  So I went 
to her and I said, excuse 
medoIknowyou?   We
re you in Birkenau?(c.322)
 Do you work in haus  
commando camp?  She says 
tomeyes.  Ididn't 
knowhername.  Idon't 
even that.  She says to me and I s
aw the number.  It wa
s much different 
than mine because she was 
in camp from '39.  
She had the 
good life, 
very early (c.325). 
 So she said, y
es I remember that.
  Didyouwork 
over there, yeah.  Did you do this,
yeah.  Didyoudothat?  Doyou 
remember the Greek girl 
who couldn't talk?  Sh
e says, no I don't. 
That's all right. 
But since then, we'
re friends here.   
 

Oh, good. 

 

We see each other ver
yoften,really.  Sheha
s two boys, the same age 
with my girls.  

 

Very nice. 

 

But we were--how we
 could communicate all this
 time together? nothing .    
 

That's what I was wonder
ing because I know this 
was a problem and it  
was also a problem for a lot of th
e Italian Jews becau
se they didn't  
know any other 
language.   
 

 
 
 
16
I didn't, I get in touch 
with Italians over ther
e.  It's so hard t o  
communicate.  You're no
t in the mood to commun
icate, nobody there. 
Just the Greeks who 
knew you and who 
go through the s
ame way that you 
do now.  But the only 
thing is, we didn't have
 any touch 
with other 
girls, nothing. 
 

Were there any incid
ents or episodes that hap
pened while you were in 
camp that stand out
 in your mind? 
 

Yeah, 
yeah.  Something 
I 
never 
can 
forget.  I 
told 
you 
mybrotherswere 
working 
in 
the 
crematorium.  And 
it 
was 
justacrossfrommy 
block 
where 
I lived, was the block 
of the ladies but the 
men were on other side.   
So my brothers, I kne
w they work over there a
nd I wanted to 
go see them 
onetime.  Sotheytold 
me, you can do 
that something. 
 Sunday,the  
blockova can help you to 
go one day when 
you don't work 
outside here.  
You are free, you can go 
see them.  So I went 
to the blockova who was 
a Polish Jew.  So I to
ld her, listen,
 I said, I don't
 remember even 
the name.  I heard my 
brothers are there.  I 
would like to give me 
permission on Sunday; it's 
a day that we have re
st, right, have rest .  
On Sunday, leave me one h
our to go and see the
m.  You know, what she  
did?  She 
slapped 
myface 
because 
I 
askedher 
that.  Since 
then, 
I 
hate 
the Polish people myse
lf because they are so
 bad.  She could do 
something, she coul
d help me, right? 
 But she didn't. 
 

She was a Jew? 

 

She was a Jew, Polish Jew.  But sh
e was really bad. 
 She wanted to be 
good with the Germans and
 she slapped my 
face.  Iwas 
so mad, I was 
crying.  Isaid, 
what can I do.  I know my 
brothers are just across 
and I can go and see them.   

 

How did you ask her?  Did yo
u ask her in German, or---? 

 
I didn't know Ger
man.  Nothing, just the 
way, you know. With the 
hands 
whatever 
I 
could 
do.  Because 
I 
have 
somebody 
else 
from 
the 
camp, 
another 
Greek 
girl.  She 
saw 
her 
husband, 
was 
working 
with 
my 
brothers .   
I said, if she can go, wh
y not me?  I don't take 
off from the job today, 
I have to work.  But Su
nday is my day of
rest.  Icoul
d go over there 
and visit my brothers.  She says no. 

 

Is there any othe
r thing like that 
stand out that 
you had either 
witnessed or h
appened to you? 

 

The revolution that happ
ened at the crematorium? 
 

In Auschwitz? 

 

Birkenau.   

 

Birkenau?  You were there
 during the revolution? 
 

Sure, it was a day that
 we had to go to work. 
 This happened the two 
last days of Succoth.  
The Germans--every time th
ey wanted to do s o m e  

 
 
 
17
selections or bad th
ing, they find the holiday
s.  Soitwasthelas t  
days of Succoth and I know
 that because the Hungar
ian girls were very 
religious people.  I do
n't know how they went
 through, they passed 
books over at the cremator
ium, in the ca
mp.  They used to
 read and pr ay  
with the shovel in 
their hands.  One had the 
shovel, the other had th e 
book.  Everytimethey 
saw the Germans, they 
hide the book
.  Youare 
free and they took th
e book out and they read 
again.  But this group 
was very religious and 
every holiday, the camp
, they show--they tel l  
us that this is Rosh H
ashonah, Yom Kippur, so
mething--holiday, you 
know.  Soweknow 
that this was Succoth, the 
last days of Succoth whe re  
we go to work again the sa
me way like ever
y day.  Six o'clock to five 
o'clock waiting out
side for the appe
l, couple of hou
rs rain or shine, 
cold or snow, nev
ermind.  Afterthat,go 
outside from th
e camp wit h  
the music.  It was seven o'clock, 
eight o'clock when
 outside at work, 
outside we hear bulle
ts going here an
d there, here an
d there.  We 
didn't know what 
happened.  WethoughttheAm
ericans or the
 Russians 
came to liberate us. 
 All of a sudden we hear
d this blochkova said, 
schnell (ph)(c.388), sch
nell in the bloc
k, schnell, schnell in the 
houses, to go back
 again we come.  We didn't
 know what happ
ened.  T h e y  
rush us inside the 
block, they clo
se the doors.  To
oquiet.  Inthe  
meantime, the bullets we
re going left and righ
t, left and right.  I 
see the soldiers going a
round here and 
screaming but we didn't know  
whathappened.  Finally 
when they stopp
ed we find what happened.  The 
boys in the crematorium c
ause a cross-fires.  Th
ey find out that they 
supposed to be killed b
ecause the Germa
ns, they knew, 
they did after 
five, six months when the
 people work in the cre
matorium, they were  
sick and tired, you kn
ow, and disgusted.  Th
ey can't do the job  
straight the way they wa
nt.  Sotheydecideev
ery five, six months, 
change them.  Kill 
them and replace with new 
ones. The G
ermans used  
to replace the peopl
e who worked in t
he Sunderkommando after five or 
six months with new ones. 
 So they knew that so the
y decide to do as 
much 
damage 
as 
they 
could 
because 
they 
knewtheywere 
dead 
anyway.  T h e  
organization that they 
used to make over there
 that guard munitions ,  
with guns, whatever they 
could do to damage.  
So when the time come  
and they call them to go
 over there, they jump
ed on these guards tha t 
they disarmed them 
and they took their arms
.  In the meantime, the 
Germans called for help. 
 

I'm just -------- 
papers.  (c.411) 
 

The Germans called fo
r a--help.  Four, 
five hundred peop
le came again, 
Germans, to give help with
 them.  So it was im
possible for the Greeks 
to win.  They knew that
.  Sosaidatleastth
ey're going to
 die last 
time free.  They kill as much as 
they could but in 
the meantime the 
crematorium was 
down and all the people who
 were over there--that's  
where my brothers were with it. 

 

At the crematori
um at the time?  
So were they part 
of the uprising, 
do you know? 

 

Yeah.  Sure, they're th
ere.  But what a use. 
 It was two, three 
hundred people who 
working over th
ere in the cremator
ium.  All of them  

 
 
 
18
went at the sa
me time.   
 
Which brothers 
were these? 
 

All three. 

 

All three? 

 

All three were there.   

 

So you know that they
 were all working at
 the crematorium? 
 

I knew because I told yo
u, I find out...  It 
was across the street,  
the crematorium, across f
rom my block.  In the 
afternoon, we used to 
eat outside.  I used to 
see some one of them 
walking but it was not 
allowed to come clo
se because of those elec
tric wires. 
  It wasn't 
allowed. 

' 

What were your food co
nditions in Birkenau? 
 

Forget about that!  Who 
thought of food?  To 
get the soup in the 
morning, you had to fi
ght and wait hours. 
 

Can we stop for a minu
te, would that be okay? 
 

Yeah, we can stop it. 
 This is better. 
 

Mrs. Carasso is going to read a written accou
nt that she wr
ote telling 
about the story in th
e crematorium.  
 

In 
the 
crematorium 
worked 
a 
groupwhich 
was 
called 
sonderkommando 
where 
just 
after 
______(c.439 
the 
peoplediedin 
the 
gas 
chamber,to 
cut 
their 
hair, extract the 
gold teeth and put them in 
the oven.  Terrible wor k  
but obliged to do it.  Every five 
or six months, they 
killed them and 
replace with a new group 
with the same luck. 
 ___(c.444)September, 
last days of Succoth, we 
got up as usual at 4 a.m.
 and waiting outside 
in line until 6 a.m
. until it gets l
ight and go to w
ork.  I forgot to 
mention that every day, g
oing and coming back from
 work, we had musi c 
playing for us. 
 Also playing 
from prisoners. 
 

What kind of music? 

 

Music--whole band, violin
, cello, the whole ba
nd.  Jewish people  
playing. 

 

Was it classi
cal music? 
 

Different things, different things.
  But Jewish people playing, 
that's what's 
important, not Germans
.  That was an ir
ony.  Onlythat 
we needed, the music.  We
 went to work as usua
lly, out of the camp.  
We went and suddenly at
 9 or 10 a.m., 
we heard bullets 
whizzing right 
and left and not too far 
from us.  
Soldie
rs running here and there w i t h  

 
 
 
19
their dogs and guns, sc
reaming and cursing.  
We didn't know wh at  
happened.  We 
start 
to 
laugh 
and 
cry 
and 
hopethat 
the 
Allies 
wereclose 
and that was the reason 
ofthisturmoil.  They 
called us to go back  
right 
awayto 
the 
camp 
and 
theylockedupin 
our 
block.  We 
were 
ordered  
to be quiet.  In the mean
time, the bullet
s kept going le
ft and right.  
This turmoil continued fo
r couple more hours.  
We stuck our nose with 
anxiety, in the 
window, and we were 
waiting with anger (?) (c.480) and 
impatience to see some 
foreign soldiers
, American or Ru
ssian to com e  
there 
and 
open 
our 
doors 
to 
freedom.  But 
thatwe 
dreamed 
day 
and 
night.  
But what disappointmen
t.  No Americans, no 
Russians showed up.  
Instead 
wehad,it 
was 
a 
revolutionin 
the 
crematorium,  The 
prisoners ,  
sunderkommando, killed t
hemselves but also th
ey killed al
l of the 
German soldiers who ha
ppened to be there  th
is time by blowing up the 
building.  Theywerethe
resixmonths.  Theyknew
 they would be killed 
in this place so they decide to take 
revenge and kill as many Germans  
as they could.  And on
 this sunderkommando 
were working my three  
brothers and this was th
eir end.  That's it. 
 
Thank you for reading tha
t. So this was in 1944,
 still?  In Succoth ,  
1944?   

 

That's right. 

 

What happened after that
?  Now you were taken
 to Ravensbruck after 
that? 

 

Yeah.  November, they 
took us to.  November. 
 I don't know.  They 
emptied the camp but they 
took us into the Rav
ensbruck.  
Over there 
I had another job nighttime. 

 

That's when you were 
filling the ----? 
 

Pistols, pistols, yeah. 

 

Now in Auschwitz then
, what did you do--? 
 

My husband was in 
Auschwitz, not me. 
 I was Birkenau. 
 

Birkenau,I'm 
sorry.  Th
at's right.  What
 other job, you said you ha d 
a job digging out in the ---? 

 

Yeah, digging was
 in Birkenau. 
 

The whole time, you
 were digging? 
 

The whole time, dig
ging.  Different 
kinds, not only digging.  They 
used to make just a bit 
hard--take piece 
of stones--move 
from one place 
to another.  Or pieces of
 the grass, move from 
one place to another .   
Just to be busy, yo
u know.  That's the worst 
part of ever
y job.  But 
the 
only 
thing 
we 
did 
and 
schnell, 
and 
schnell 
and 
schnell 
all 
the 
time.  
Fast, fast, fast.  We had 
so much strength this
 time to do fast job 
like that but we had to, 
nochoice.  Notonly-
-to Ravensbruck, they 

 
 
 
20
put us to nighttime.  
 

And in the day? 

 

No, nighttime. 

 

You only worked at night? 

 

Nighttime.  Did you 
sleep in the day? 
 

No, 
how 
we 
could 
sleep?  They 
don'tleaveyou 
quiet 
to 
sleep 
overthere, 
my 
God.  To 
catch 
a 
little 
sleep,we're 
praying 
to 
leave 
us 
alone.  But 
it was really a very hard
 job and we w
ere very disappointed because 
Germans were really cru
el to the Jewish people. 
 Youthough
t that they  
had something perso
nal with us.  I 
told you my brot
her that used to 
send me packages w
hen I was in Birkenau only
 when transpo
rts came from 
the other cities when th
ey came to Auschwitz, 
they brought
 stuff with 
them, colognes, dre
ss things, food like we 
brought.  So all of these 
they gave to these 
people who work
ing in the cremator
ium.  Thepeople,  
they distribute between 
them--who had someone wh
ere to send in t he 
camps, they did, but who 
didn't have it
, did nothing.  So my brothers 
they found a way to send 
one package sometimes.  
This was a big holi da y 
for 
us 
because 
we 
knew 
mybrotherswere 
alive.  But 
after 
this 
happene d  
from the crematorium, th
at'sit.  Afterthere
volution in the camp,  
no packages, no news,
 nothing from them. 
 

Is there anything else f
rom your time in the co
ncentration camps that 
you can tell me? 

 

About the revolution--the cremat
orium, I told yo
u.  What else? 
 

Then you were in Rave
nsbruck? and you 
were in one more? 
 

Malhov, Malho
v.  Yes. 
 

Is that a work camp? 

 

It was a rest camp
 for sleeping the 
whole day.  We 
didn't do nothing  
there.  All day we 
were in bed, bel
ieve it or not. 
 

Did you get sick at any 
ofthese 
times?  Didyou
 catch anything, typ h u s  
or anything? 

 

Yes,yes.  No,no.   Ju
st temporary.  What are 
those, I don't know.   
One day, it's unbelievable but yo
u're going to la
ugh, I was in 
Ravensbruck.  My feet were swollen 
from the sun.  My 
eyes were swollen 
here too.  They told me 
it's because I 
don't have enough
 vitamins.  I 
said where am I going to 
get vitamins he
re?  So they put me to the 
hospital for that.  They
 didn't do nothing, th
ey just let me lay in  
bed.  I stay over there four days 
in the hospital.  
 Nospecialcare, 
just relax at le
ast.  Thelastday, 
I'm supposed to re
turn to my blo c k ,  
I 
dreamed 
ofmy 
mother, 
believe 
itor 
not.  This 
never 
happened 
before.  

 
 
 
21
She said to me, don't wo
rry, everything 
will be all ri
ght, I'm with 
you  Don't worry, you'
ll be all righ
t.  Next day-
-I feel chills 
myself, one thing--becau
se I never dream my moth
er over that, never .   
But this last day, she 
said don't worry,
 you'll be all right, you'll 
be all right.  I'm with yo
u.  Next day they let 
me go to the camp again 
with the other gi
rls.  We stay over there 
till the day-
-to this day ,  
1944, we're suppose
d to transfer agai
n.  To Berlin, I don't know or 
where I don't k
now.  So we got ready, we 
start to walk ag
ain, day and 
nighttime.  May,but 
it was real cold over th
ere, believe it or not, 
and we walking for two da
ys.  We stopped just for 
a while to get a res t  
and walk again.  Food, 
forget what had.
  All of a su
dden, after two  
days walking, the guards
 disappeared.  We star
t to talk ab
out how the 
Greeks were togethe
r, the only bit of--.  
Where we going 
now, where  
we 
going, 
don't 
know 
nothing,where 
to 
go 
here?  Nobody, 
nobodytote ll  
us what to do.  So we
 just got a group of a cou
ple of girls together.  
We start to see where
 the other people
 go, we go too.  Because it was 
the only way.  So
 we went to--. 
 
Can I stop you, I want
 to flip the tape? 
 

Yeah.   No langu
age, no thing. 
We're walking to find out where 
all the people 
go, we go too.  So 
in the meanti
me I met some cousins 
from Janina. We go
t all together then--some bo
ys not only girls.  We  
decide together to 
go here or there until we 
find a place.  Finally  
one agent came and tri
ed to concentrate all th
e Greeks in one place 
and we went with h
im.  Theyputusinhotel-
-in a school, 
not hotel-- i n  
a school for one month.  It was--I
 think it was this
 one--they put us 
in a school.  And we ha
ve regular food 
over there  and freedom to do  
or to go, wherever we want 
to go.  I had a real 
terrific time then.    
 

This is after the 
liberation then? 

 

Yeah, after. 

 

Who--what month wer
e you liberated? 
 

May, 1945.  In the 
street, I told you.
  We're walking. 
 

Oh, you're just
 walking? 
I'm sorry, okay. 
 

We're walking and the gua
rdsleftus.  That's 
why I didn't know wha t  
to do.  

 

I see, okay, okay. 

 

So when we met our--th
ese people from Greece, 
men and more girls, we  
got all together, make a 
group and then 
decide to go al
l together to 
one place.  So 
they concentrate 
us in this school 
over there all  
together.  We stayed till they colle
ct all the people
 around, it was 
almost 
five, 
six 
months, 
westay 
there.  In 
the 
meantime 
we 
had 
freedom 
to do everything we wa
nted to do.  We went 
out nighttime.  We went 
daytime, we'r
e free!  

 
 
 
22
 
How did you get money or anythi
ng?  You were th
ere--were ther e 
societies, aid s
ocieties, Joint? 
 

Notyet.  Nobodyreach 
us yet.  But we managed 
somehow, I don't know 
how we managed.
  The boys were more
 capable ______(c.631) 
 

Where did the food co
me from then if 
it wasn't---?  
 

In school they give 
us food, in school. 
 

So you were at t
his school and they
 just took care of
 you?  I see. 
 

Right, in school they gave
 us everything.
  ThentheUN
RRA, you heard 
the UNRRA?, they con
tactus.  Thedoctorsexami
ne us and they gave us 
vitamins because ev
erybody was short 
ofvitamins.  I 
didn't have m y  
period all this time myself because
 the Germans they used to pu t  
something in the soup. 

 

Oh, really? 

 

Yeah, we don't h
ave any period.
  I didn't 
have any... 
 

The whole time in th
e concentration camp? 

 

Yes.  No, no.  That's why they tr ied to treat us. 
 Buteverybodywas 
anxious to go home this 
time.  Nobodywantto 
staythere.  Nomatter, 
if we didn't find nothing 
withhouse.  So
 we stay in this school and  
after six months, 
September, they put us in a 
plane and send us back 
to Greece.  Another di
sappointment, we
're going back to Greece.  No  
one, no one from the Jo
int was in port to wait f
orus.  Nobodywasov er  
there.  Firstnight
, be in Greece, myself, I 
slept on the pavements 
of the high 
school.   
 

Really? 

 

Yeah.   Nobod
y was there. 
 

Was anyone with you?
  Allthepeoplethatwere
 with you left and went 
back to try and fin
d their families? 
 

Everybody had somebody wh
o come to pick th
em up from the 
plane.  Ihad 
nobodybecause 
I 
wasnot 
from 
Athens 
myself.  I 
was 
only 
withmy 
sister, 
that's all. 

 

Then you--when did yo
u find your sister, 
_________?(c.645) 
 

After the liberation, we were separ
ated for a short 
time but we got 
together soon. 

 

Oh, so she went throu
gh the camp?  I did
n't realize that, okay 
 

 
 
 
23
Yeah. Going from Birken
au to Ravensbruck, th
ey put us in plain--in 
small cars, smal
l cars.  Not cars l
ike this, cars with 
the wheels with 
no cover. 
 

Cold, like the 
things--it was outdoors? 
 

Yeah, no cover, no nothin
g.  Justthecars
.  Westayover
there   S o  
we're going front 
myself in a car and my s
ister was going in another 
car, in the back.  So we 
didn't pay attention.  H
er car fell 
in a ditch 
and I didn't see it.  
We continue ourselves, con
tinue, continue.  All 
of a sudden, I rememb er, where is my si
ster? where is my 
sister? I said.   
Nobody know because
 she stuck over th
ere.  I find my
 sister three 
months later--anoth
er surprise.  All this 
time, I was cr
ying, I was  
all the time with my sister and now
 the last time we
're free, I lost 
her.  I couldn't really say anything
 about that.  So one day we wer e 
a group outside to eat.  
All of a sudden one of 
the women com
e to me.  
I 
didn't 
even 
know 
her.  She 
cameto 
me, 
says 
to 
me, 
she 
was 
from 
another 
camp, from a villag
e, a little fart her from the bar
racks where we 
stationed ourselves.  Sh
e says to me, do you 
have a sister
?  Istart 
to cry.  I say I know 
I have a sister but I do
n't know where she is.  
She says to me, I know w
ho she is.  I didn't know
 this woman, never 
saw her in my life.  I 
said, how do y
ou know she is my
 sister?  She  
says to me, you look ali
ke.  Believeitorno
t, we don't look alike, 
with my sister.   I don
't know then but now we do
n'tlookalike.  She 
says to me, you look alike.  I tell 
you where she is.  She told me.  
I ask again. How do 
you know it's my sister?  Your sister is in the 
next village here.  How can
 I go myself? 
 Do I know.  So
 when we came 
to this camp over ther
e, were some people 
from Yugoslavia, Jewish 
people, took care of t
he camp, Yugosla
vian people.  He
 took care of 
us, food, someth
ing to get dressed, things 
likethat.  Th
is--his name
 
was Melumed, Melumed (ph
)(c.670).  Isaid,Mel
umed said--you're not  
going 
to 
believe 
that.  Somebody 
told 
me--heknow 
the 
story 
that 
I 
lo st  
my sister this wa
y--somebody told me 
that my sister is 
in this village.   
How can I get 
there?  Hesaysto 
me, I just came from 
there, he says 
to me.  How should I kn
ow?  I didn't know them
.   Sohowcanwego? 
how can do that?  
He says to me, don't worry. 
 I'll try to find a way.  
He was the head of the c
amp.  Nextday, 
all of us saw 
him come with 
my sister.  You don't be
lieve how it felt when
 I saw her, at least I 
had somebody.   

 

So the two of you came 
back to this camp? 
 

Yeah, came back 
together.  WenttoAmsterda
moverthere.  Westayed 
intheschool.  Idon't 
remember some st
illthere.  It
's a city near 
Berlin.  I don't remember that really
.  Ihavethis 
story all writte n 
and I don't rememb
eranything.  Any
way, we got together 
with my sister 
since then and we came
 back to Greece to
gether in 1945.   
 

Did you find a
ny relatives? 

 

I 
didn't 
find 
the 
most 
important, 
my 
family.  
Always, 
I 
hoped 
that 
some 
one of my brothers esc
aped.  Because they sa
id someone 
escaped to 

 
 
 
24
Russia.  I said, maybe, it's one of
 my brothers, maybe.  I was goin g 
downtown and I was lookin
g and looking here and 
there to se
e if I could 
find one at least from 
my brothers or a familiar
face.  MaybeI'llf i n d  
some one of my family-
-nothing, nob
ody.   
 
Terrible. 

 

To tell me. 

 

Then you stayed in Athens for a 
while?  Is that 
how you met your 
husband? 

 

Yeah.  _______
___(c.687).  Ineedsomebody 
to take care of me.  Who's 
going to feed me?  I don't have house, I don't have 
nothing nowadays.  
So I start to work in t
he Joint Distribution Co
mmittee.  Overthere ,  
I met my husband because 
he came three months late
r to work there to o.   
 

I see.  Do you want--we 
could--if you ha
ve a picture of
 your husban d  
from around the war 
period, we can include him 
in this project also.  
If you can tell me 
about his life. 
 

My husband was not from 
Janina or Preveza.  He 
was from Salonika.  
Would you know anything 
about what his childhood 
was like or anything?  
 

The only thing I have is
 his picture when he wa
s in the army, if w e  
can find this picture. 
 It was too old picture
 for him--h
e was in the 
army then.  Charles, his 
brother, was very act
ive in sports; very 
active in sports an
d my husband was 
a pharmacist.   
 

Did he work in Amer
ica as a pharmacist? 
 

No, he had to go to sc
hool and have th
e American degree.   In the 
meantime, I had the smal
l child, three years ol
d and I was 
pregnant.   
He says to me, how can I 
go to school? 
 Who's going to take care of  
you?  So better
 start to work. 
 So he starts 
to work here. 
 

What was his occ
upation here? 
 

He was working--you know
 how I did--at a doctor
's hospital 
in Charles 
Street.  He was a pharma
cist with no la
nguage.  Every time the nurs e 
used to go to the pharma
cy and ask for medicine, 
my husband would sa y 
write, write.  Bec
ause he didn't--could
n't understand what sh e 
talked.  She used to w
rite the name of the me
dicine and give to him.  
But 
after 
one 
year, 
hequit 
because 
thepay 
was 
not 
good.  He 
had 
family  
to feed. 
 And I couldn
't work either myself be
cause I had 
one child 
and 
pregnant, 
how 
can 
goto 
work?  So 
afterthat, 
he 
quit, 
after 
a 
year.  
He start to work at Read's
 Drugstore, two 
shifts a day to 
make the mone y 
he needed.  He d
idn't have nobody but the Jo
int really, he
 helped u s  
in the beginning.  Wh
en he saw that th
e salary went
 up, they gave les s ,  
you know.  They used to give 
certain amount e
very week for the 
expenses.  Rent, I h
ave to pay rent here.
  I have to pay for 
everything,right?  Soth
ey give us certain amo
unt.  Every time he saw 

 
 
 
25
it went up, they reduce 
the amount till he got fr
ee.  Hegotonlywhat 
heneeded.  Finallyhede
cided to make--
to start a job, 
his own.  He 's  
not going to work for so
mebody else.  He
 succeeded rea
lly.   Hedid 
very good job. 
 

He opened his own pharmacy? 

 

No, how?  He had to go to
 school to have the degree. 
 

So what did he--? 

 

Shipchandler.  Heworkedwithships
, with the Greek shi
ps.  Heopened  
the store.  He got mer
chandise for the 
ships and the pe
ople from the 
ships, they used to come in Balti
more.  They used to go to the store 
and buy things and send 
back to Greece.  He go
t this job an
d forgot 
the pharmacy. 

 

I see.   

 

What for four years 
in college again to 
have the American
degree?  H e  
didn't 
know 
English 
either 
but 
somehow 
he 
managed 
his 
way.  He 
did 
very 
good but then every
thing has an end. 
 That right?   
 

I suppose so.  Is the
re anything else right no
w about your story that 
for the sake of our tape and our 
interview that you 
haven't mentioned, 
that you would like 
to mention? That
 you can think of? 
 

I don't remember.  I don't 
think I have anything else. 
 

Any details that you left
 out, that you would 
liketo---?  Anything 
specific again that stan
ds our in your mind of
 a particular--either  

from your childhood or
 anything that happen
ed during the war?  
 

I told you my childhood. 

 

Right. 
So 
nothing 
stands 
out, 
aside 
from 
the 
things 
that 
you've 
already 
told me about? 

 

I don't recall anything t
hat I left out.  I thin
k I said everything .   
That's why I told you to 
read this one 
because here wh
en I wrote this 
one, I have more q
uiet, you know.  I expre
ss myself much better when 
I am quiet.  But I thoug
ht I mentioned everything. 
 

Could we go on and talk a 
little bit about your 
brothers here that you 
have pictures of? 

 

Yeah. 

 

Which brother is th
is on the left? 
 

This, Josef. 

 

 
 
 
26
Joseph?  Wh
at Jani? 
 
The younger, the younger,
 was still in school. 
 

What can you tell me about his p
ersonality?  Wh
at was he like? 
 

Oy.  He was full of life and so amu
sing, this boy, i
t's unbelievable.  
He was full of life.  
He made everybody in th
e house laug
h with his 
jokes. 

 

So he had a good 
sense of humor? 
 

A lot.  A lot more th
an everyone of us. 
 

Did he do that 
in school also? 
 

Yes.  And a thousan
d friends.  
 

Yeah, a lot of
 friends. 
 

Yeah.  Myhouse,whenthe
 kids were home
, my house was full of kids, 
one going and coming,
 going and coming. 
 

What kind of--he went to th
e Alliance School or not? 
 

No, no.  Alliance was in Ja
nina; was not in Preveza. 
 

He just went to a publ
ic school in Preveza? 
 

Yeah, the regular school. 

 

What--did he have
 a bar mitzvah? 
 

We didn't have bar 
mitzvah over there. 
 

You don't have? 

 

Notthistime.  Insh
ul, they did something 
but that's it.  Not big  
like here. Nothing
 to compare with
 this country. 
 

I know, I realize th
at. But he could 
read Hebrew and .... 
 

Yeah, he could read in 
school, Hebrew.  Learned 
in school, I told you. 
 

He went to a J
ewish school? 
 

Well, the elementary school they ha
ve Hebrew too a little bit.  A 
little 
bit, 
not 
too 
much.  I 
had 
a 
littlemorein 
Alliance 
myself.  But 
in Preveza I had a little
 bit, not too much. 

 

Was it for only Jewis
h students or ---? 
 

 
 
 
27
No..... 
 

He was in a Jewish school or
 was it a public school? 
 

No, no, no.  Allianc
e was a Jewish school.   
But this one 
was a public 
school.  But 
the rabbi from 
the shul used to take
 couple hours every  
week and just teach th
em the basics of t
he Jewish language. 
 

He tried to do 
there? (c.745) 
 

Because there we
re very few boys 
over there.   
 

I see.  So that's how th
ey got a Jewish education? 
 

Yeah, 
just 
a 
littlebit, 
not 
too 
much.  Enough 
toknowthat 
he's 
Jewish.   
 

Right, right. 

 

But 
in 
Alliance, 
we 
had 
regular 
hours 
for 
Hebrew, 
for 
French, 
and 
Greek. 
 

So it was more 
rigorous?   
 

Yeah.  I was not in Jani
na at this time.  Comi
ng back to Preveza, n o  
Alliance there.  

 

I see.  So he gr
ew up in Preveza? 
 

Yeah.   

 

The whole time? 

 

Yeah, yeah. 

 

Did he go to Italy?
  Was he born yet w
hen you were in Italy? 
 

I think he was bor
n--he was one year old may
be, I don't kn
ow.  Hewas 
very small.  

 

Did he do any sp
orts or anything? 
 

Everywhere.  Spo
rts is the boys' thing, 
you know.   
Everything. 
 

Which sports in
 particular? 
 

Baseball. 

 

Like American
 baseball? 
 

Well, it seems to me 
it's like the Ameri
can, yes.  Baseball. 
 

Did he play soccer? 

 

 
 
 
28
Soccer, yes, yes. 
 

So he was friendly and o
utgoing and 
humorous? 
 

He was the youngest in t
he house, you know that. 
 

So when you were depor
ted, then he worked in
 the crematorium? 
 

Yeah, that's the luck. 
 If he was working some
where else, maybe he 
could be saved.
  But no. 
 

How about--which brother?
  This is Albert?  
Or this is Moise? 
 

No, no, this is Moise.  Albert is t
he other one, the 
small pi
cture I 
showed you.  

 

Okay, would you want to
 talk about Maurice fo
r a few minutes?  
 

I told you Maurice 
I know so little because 
he left when he was nine  
years old and he came when
 he was in school.  
He was like a stranger 
to us when he came back because he d
idn't know ev
enGreek.  Heforgot 
his language after so many years.  Bu
t slowly, we got 
used to him and 
he started to ta
lk Greek better. 
 

What was he like? 
 Was he serious? 
 His personality? 
 

Oh, 
he 
was 
very 
serious, 
this 
one.  He 
was 
the--my 
father'sstrong 
hand 
over the house bu
t we--he used to 
do a lot of thing
s, helped anyway.   
 

He lived--all the children 
lived in the same house? 
 

All together, all together. 

 

So he was--he's 
the one who worked in the ---? 
 

Electric company. 

 

Right. So like a book
keeper kind of ---? 

 

Well, like an admi
nistrator because 
he did the whole thi
ng over there. 
that's right. 

 

None of these broth
ers were married, 
is that right? 
 

No, no.  This is the r
eason I thought someoneof those--someone, at 
least one will be ba
ck.  But nothing.. 

 

What about Albert?  

 

Albert, I told.  He was finished the sc
hool, the elemen
tary school  in 
myhometown.  After 
that he went to help my 
father in the 
store because 
he needed somebody. 

 
 
 
29
 
So he didn't go 
to gymnasium? 
 

No.  He didn't 
have any chance,
 this one.  
 

What was his personality like? 

 

Very serious boy, very se
rious boy.  It's not li
ke modern boys to run 
here and there.  He was 
very--family boy this one. 
 

Oh, yeah.  He liked to
 stay with the family? 
 

Well, he did. 

 

Was he protective of 
you and your sister? 
 

All the time, all the ti
me and all of
 them.   
 

But you said that 
you had combin
ed friends.  Was th
is the brother that 
you had the joint fr
iends with, Albert? 

 

These 
boys 
had 
friends 
their 
age.  So 
I 
used 
to 
go 
excursions, 
daytime ,  
for example.  From morn
ing till afternoon.  
With them and thei r 
friends too. My
 friends, too, together. 
 

So you all went
 together? 
That's nice. 
 

Yeah.  Alone, 
we're not allowed
 to go alone. 
 

That's right.  W
here would you go? 
 

Some small place we had 
near my city.  
Outside, very 
nice, like you 
go for a picnic outside. 

 

Did you ride your bicycle th
ere?  Or how 
did you go? 
 

Are you kidding?  Bicycle at this 
time?  We'renot 
allowed gi
rls on 
bicycle.   

 

You weren't allowed
 to bicycle? 
 

No, no.   

 

Very strict 
upbringing. 
 

I told you.  We're not allowed to 
go out by ourselves.  Every time I 
wanted to go, just a wa
lk outside--not a ride
, to walk a little 
outside--someone had to 
be with me.Tell me! 

 

It's another world. 

 

I 
wantedto 
go 
to 
movies, 
I 
have 
to 
goshop 
around.  I 
can't 
goby 
myself 

 
 
 
30
and the movies... 
 

Even with your friends, 
you couldn't just go--? 

 

No, no.  We had to have
 a male companion.They shop around too. 
 

This is all your--did all
 the girls there have 
the--looklike  this  
for all the girls? 

 

From this hometown, yes. 

 

I told you it was sm
all city, that's why. 
 

In Janina it was a litt
le different.  But my 
hometown, ______(c.799), 
I couldn't... 

 

In Athens, it co
uldn't have be
en like this? 
 

Oh, no.  Are you kiddin
g, not to go by yourself 
wherever you
 want t o  
go?  No,Athenswasno
t like that.  But my hom
etown, I told you, it 
was 
a 
very 
small 
town--Jewishpeoplevery 
low.  They 
live 
together 
ju st  
likethat.  Youcouldn't 
do anything be
cause if you say 
something, the 
whole city would ta
lk next day.   
 

Do you know things about 
your family, li
ke the--how long
 they've been 
in Greece?  I mean, th
ey're Sephardic, had they
 been there since the 
Spanish expulsion in 1492? 

 

Much before the expuls
ion.  They're born over
 there and raised in 
Greece and nothing el
se.  They say... 
 

[PLEASENOTE:  AGAIN-WE
 HAVE DETERMINED TAT T
HE GANI FAMILY WERE O F  
ROMANIOT DESCENT, WHICH 
IS THE GROUP WHO RESI
DED IN GREECE AND THE 
BALKANS] 

 

Many generations? 

 

Yeah,many.  Theysaywe
 come from Israel.  Bu
t I don't see anything, 
I don't know where.  My
 parents they d
idn't speak no 
other language  
except Greek. 

 

Do they know Hebrew? 

 

No, nothing, no.  But th
ey kept the 
holidays. 
 

So--but they were Sephar
dic, not .....Eskewazyes 
 

Sephardic, 100%. 

 

So they were probab
ly from the Span
ish expulsion? 
 

Only my husband's fa
mily. My husband's 
family half Spa
nish.  Because 

 
 
 
31
his family comes 
from Spain.   
 
Right. ____
_(c.818) 
 

My husband's mother di
dn't know one word Gr
eek, only Spanish. 
 

Really? 

 

Yeah. 

 

Oh, wow.Yeah, I guess in Salon
ika, they had a lot of ,,,, 
 

A lot.  There were a l
ot of Jews over there and 
they kept 
the Spanish 
language. 

 

Ladino? 

 

Ladino, yeah.  Even the gentiles, they're 
obliged to learn Spanish 
because they couldn't
 work in Solani
ka.  Becauseall 
the commerce was  
inJewishhands.  Exce
pt for that the Jews di
dn't work in Salonika o n  
Saturday.  Thegentiles,theywere 
obliged to stop 
work too because  
they couldn't do anything. 

 

I didn't realize that.  

 

It was really--it was Jewi
sh, Jewish, Jewish cit
y.  Everywher
e.  How 
many shuls they had over 
there? 10 - 15, I don't 
know exactly. How many 
shuls they had in Saloni
ka? a lot.  My 
husband, the fi
rst time went 
over there, he was crying
 to see how Salonika 
became ghost-
ridden.   
 

So you visited 
afterwards? 
 

Oh, 
yes.  I 
visited 
Israel 
five 
times.  I 
wentby 
theway 
in 
the 
eastern  
Europe one time because 
my husband and 
I wanted to sa
y a prayer, a 
kaddish we say, to 
my parents.  We do
n't have any grave here.  So I 
said to my husband, one 
time we have to 
go to Birkenau because I know 
theretheydied.  SoI 
went over there but beli
eve me, we passed all 
the eastern European 
countries.  You 
couldn't talk to
 them, first of 
all, because the language is so 
different.  But whe
n I arrived to 
Cracow in Poland and we'
re going closer to Bir
kenau, I start to cry 
myself because I felt, I 
felt my parents 
are dead here and 
I don't know 
where. So I went to Birkenau and 
I took a little sa
nd from that and 
I brought  over here, ju
stonetime.  ThenIwen
t to block 
where I w a s  
sleeping.  I saw the be
d, I showed my husband
 the bed where I wa s. 
Still the beds are ther
e, still the blocks ar
e there, everything, a 
littleruined 
now 
after 
so 
many 
years, 
but 
stillthey're 
there.  I 
to ld
 
my husband, you s
ee this bed.  I s
lept in the second 
floor, my sister 
and I and a couple
 of friends.  In one be
d were sleepi
ng six girls, 
like sardines.  We coul
dn't turn from one side 
to another.  And food, 
forget about that.  A pi
ece of bread with marg
arine and salami what  
they have.  I used to eat
 half at nighttime, ha
lf in the morning. 
Because 
wedidn't 
want 
toworkwith 
empty 
stomach.  So 
many 
times, 
th ey  

 
 
 
32
used to steal at nightti
me, the other girls.   
 

Really? 

 

Oh,yes.  Theyw
ere hungry, I don't
 blame them.  Bu
t we had nothing  
more than that.  So when
 I show it to him, my 
block and where we slept 
and the life we had over
 there, he says 
to me now let's 
go to Auschwitz  
and I show my block.  So we went 
after left Birkenau,
 was a h
alf-hour 
walking distance.  We
nt to Auschwitz.  F
irst of all they show over 
there the rooms w
here they have different thi
ngs from the 
people who 
were there.  Sui
tcases, shoes, hair
, these cans fro
m Zyklon B and 
things like that.  Or they have diff
erent rooms and y
ou visit and you 
can see them.  
When finished all of
 that, then he sa
ys, let's go t o  
myplace.  Hetookme--
this was more di
stant this place 
because it was 
two blocks--two ___
___(c.866) blocks.
  Myhusbandsa
ys this was our  
first floor and 
this was my sleeping place.  
But it was like a house.  
Mine was like a barn, you 
know.  Different.
  Theywantedtoshowt o  
that crowds and the 
Red Cross that they treat
ed good, the Je
wish.  And 
he was going to 
sports over ther
e, play baseball 
and basketball, 
whatever 
it 
is, 
with 
the 
other 
prisoners.  They 
had 
more 
freedom 
there.  
We were really 
prisoners in 
Birkenau.   

 

I 
guess 
itdepends, 
you 
know,whenever 
he 
got 
there, 
the 
state 
of 
health 
that he was in? 

 

No, he was lucky 
because when they to
ld us, when we we
re at Birkenau 
what profession we have. 
 My husband says ph
armacist.  Ididn'tsay 
nothing 
because 
I 
didn't 
have 
any 
profession.  I 
was 
just 
in 
the 
school  
and 
then 
in 
thehouse, 
what 
profession 
I 
have?  So 
just 
because 
of 
that, 
they put him in the se
ction where they
 kept the pro
fessionals, the 
doctors and things 
like that.  Going
 to Auschwitz, th
ey put him over 
there, to take care of
 the sick peopl
e.  How they take care?  No 
medicine, 
no 
nothing, 
justwithaspirins 
and 
water.  But 
the 
only 
thing 
is, he had a little fr
eedom, more than I did.  He was not scared of 
this selections they used
 to make once in a 
while, but a
lways the 
holidays, Peseach, Su
ccoth, Rosh Hashonah
, Yom Kippur, all th e 
holidays.  Whenwecome
 back from work, 
they rush us in 
the block aga i n  
and the blockaltester ca
me to visit us.  What's
 that, it's going to 
be a selection.  God, ev
erybody tried to hide be
cause even if you ar e 
strong, if you have so
mething, small 
thing in here 
or in your stomach 
or 
somewhere 
else, 
crematorium 
right 
away.  So 
wewere 
scared 
to 
deat h.   
They used to wake up 
us, 11, 12 o'clock
 from the sleep to visit us.  
The next day, midnight... 

 

Selection? 

 

They took the numbers of
 the selected girls a
nd the next day you see  
this girl disappeared.  One day was
 in the line for work, next day 
they're not.  You didn't know fro
m one day to anoth
er what would 
happen.  Today you are alive, you wor
k.  Nextday, 
maybe you're not .  
Depends how lucky you are.   

 

 
 
 
33
Terrible. 
 

Tell me.  When I was li
berated, I was 100 pound
s,likethat.  I'mnot 
fat, I never was fat butI never was 100 
pounds either.
  After the 
liberation, I told 
you they kept us to this
 hotel for three months, 
two months, I don't know 
how long.  You know what 
we did the whole day.  
Eating and sleeping, eat
ingandsleeping.  We 
came back to Greece I  
was just like that fat.  
I couldn't bend myself 
and tie my shoes, so 
fat 
I 
was.  That's 
true.  But 
afterthat, 
slowly, 
slowly, 
I 
lost 
a 
bit.  
Not because I kept
 any diet but I 
didn't eat like 
that and I move a 
little around.  Over the
re, I was sleeping beca
use I was so
 tired; I 
wanted so much to sleep. 
 At work, I was 
looking, having 
my shovel in 
my hands, I was l
ooking.  Ifno
body was lookin
g, to lay a bit in the 
grass and sleep, 
to find just a 
moment to rest.  
My friends and my 
sister used to say oh go
 in this corner and sle
ep.  I'll take a look.  
If somebody comes, I'll 
wake you up.  This was 
something we used to 
do for them.  Go, la
y in this corner.  I'll 
take a look.  If somebody 
comes, 
I 
will 
wake 
you 
up 
again.  We 
were 
so 
dead 
for 
sleeping, 
so 
dead.  
And going to block to re
lax, you know, in the bl
ock were 10
0 kinds of 
girls over there  Diff
erent nationalities, 
different education, 
different backgroun
d.  Theystart 
to fight.  We want to go to sleep 
and relax, they start to
 fight.  They fight in 
their languages.  I  
didn't know what they say,
 what they did but t
he only thing fight and 
scream.  

 

When you came to Athe
ns, what did your 
sister--?  You 
met your husband 
then at the Joint?  
Did you come to America at
 the same ti
me with your 
sister? 

 

No, I came six m
onths before my
 sister.  
 

She got married in Gr
eece also?    
 

No, she married here, af
ter me. 
 I was married 
in Greece but she was 
younger, I told you. 
 She married here. 
 

But she managed to come
 to America too?  
 

Yeah. 

 

Did she live with 
you then when ---? 

 

No, they send her to Chicago. 

 

Oh. 

 

She lived one year in Chica
go.  She went to schoo
l all this year and 
after 
that, 
the 
Joint--because 
the 
Joint 
helped 
her 
sendto 
school 
over 
there--she 
quit.  She 
cameto 
New 
York 
and 
she 
start 
towork 
over 
there.   
 

Did she try to come to 
the same city? 
You had come 
to Baltimore? 
 

 
 
 
34
I didn't know where to go 
because they asked me if
 I had relatives here 
to help me, to go to 
America.  I said, I di
dn't want to say I had 
relatives because I didn't
 want to bothe
r them to help me.  I said I'm 
old enough, I'll go over 
there.  I can work and do
 my--make my life.   
I don't like to bother n
obody.  SoIsaid 
I have nobody.  So they had  
opening; was open her
e in Baltimor e so they send us 
here.  Isaidaf te r 
all, 
I 
have 
some 
friends 
in 
New 
York 
but 
I 
didn'tliketo 
bother 
anybody.  
I said New York and Ba
ltimore, they ar
en't far away. 
 If I have 
_____(c.918), I'll go vi
sit them.  But I didn't 
go.  I didn't say that 
I have relatives in
 New York, I didn't
 want to say that.
  Sotheysend 
me here.  I said, fine
.  Here, I don't care
.  Stranger keeps you 
sending you there, 
it'll be a new place.  But 
I'm glad.  My husba n d ,  
though, all the time, he 
didn't like Baltimore w
hen he came here.   
 
Why not? 

 

Because we're the first 
Greek who came to Balt
imore, the fi
rst one.  
We don't have nobody. 
 The gentile Gr
eeks lived but
 far away and 
different.  With 
somebody in our own religi
on, you know,...  So he 
says to me all right, le
t's see what we're goin
g to do.  We
'll try to 
go 
to 
New 
Yorkbecause 
wehave 
our 
people.  We 
tried, 
one 
yearwe 
tried, 
next year we tried.  Th
e other year we t
ried.  Inthe 
meantime, we're 
used to this life now here.  Also 
more people came 
from Greece here . 
 

There are other Greeks? 

 

Yeah, they came.  First 
they moved around.  One 
moving to California, 
another one moving 
Cleveland, another one moving New 
York 
sotheygo 
here 
and 
there.  But 
in 
the 
first 
time, 
we're 
completely 
alone, it was good to ha
ve them here.  
Now, there a
re two, three 
families here.  

 

Immediately 
after 
thewar 
when 
you 
were 
recuperating 
at 
this 
place 
when  
you were sleeping and eatin
g, what was going --? 
 
 

Where, where? 

 

InGermany.  Whatwasgoingthrough
 your mind?  Did
 you think about 
what happened or did y
ou just not, 
try not? 
 

I was thinking of going 
back home and fin
d my family.  T
hat's what I  
hoping, find somebody
 from my family.  I was 
really disappointed when  
I didn't see nobody. 

 

Were you able to get any re
parations from the ---? 
 

Yes, again we got, after 
a while, not this 
time when I need it really.  
After a while, I made 
application Germ
an consulate and  they give us.  
Every month I get somet
hing.  But the first ti
me when I need it, they 
didn't have nothing. 

 

Well, 
I 
wantto 
thank 
you 
very 
much.  If 
there's 
nothing 
elsethat 
you'd 

 
 
 
35
like to add, we can 
turn off the tape. 
 
Just ask me somethin
g.  Idon'tremem
ber if I have any
 thing written 
overhere.  Itoldyou, 
I told you about.
..  This is my story, you know 
that.  You read 
that, didn't you? 
 

Yes. 

 

Okay.  Of course, this one too.
