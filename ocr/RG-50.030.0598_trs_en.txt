October 16 and 17, 2010
 
 
Question: Hello. We're starting the interview 
again because I am afraid that it did not 
record.  This is the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with Ruth 
Heiman, conducted by Agatha Lysis (ph.) on th
e 16th of October at the Kindertransport 
Association conference in Ar
lington, Virgin ia. I apologize in advance that you would 
have to repeat, but we will just -- now that 
I've heard mo re, maybe it will even be more 
helpfu l that I can direct questions in a way --  
 
Answer: Okay. My name is Ru
th Heiman. You know that al
ready. I was born Decemb er 
31, 1923, at 7:00 in the even
ing, five hours before 1924; tax deduction, exactly nine 
months after my parents got married. My moth
er was -- my parents had a textile business. 
My uncles -- I had -- my  father had several br
others. It's a large fa
mily, and they had a 
wholesale busin ess. And my  father, who was to
tally disinterested in business -- I had to 
go back to that -- however, 
they set him up in the tex
tile business. And we lived 
comfortable, but no comp arison to my  uncles 
who were all very wea
lthy. And my  father 

was, by nature, highly mu sical, would have lik
ed to be a musician, 
which was out of the 

question. And as I mentioned be
fore, he had been in America before the war. At the age 
of 18, he had come to America like some of
 his brothers. Were in LouisianA: I don't 
know for how long. And 
when World War I broke out, his br
others insisted he come back 
to Germany. If you refuse -- and they said
 
if you refuse, then you will not
 belong to our fam
ily anymore. He went back, married my 
mo ther who had a profession, which was un
usual for wo men. Sh e was a chemist and 
worked for the Germany equivalency of Gene
ral Electric, it was ca
lled IB, until she got 
married, and then sh e always 
worked. My mother always wo
rked. We had a business, she 
work ed in  the business. Very strong, very st
rong, very  powerful woman. As I say, mo st 
women were mu ch stronger and mo re able to 
cope than  men. And my  childhood, as such, 
was quite pleasant, until I was about 5 -- until 
I was about 10 years old. And even  then, 
our parents protected us to th
e umpteenth degree. We really didn't know wh at was going 
on. They  kept -- I knew from nothing. To the ex
tent that -- I don't know if it's right or 
wrong. Today you would probably 
consider it wrong. At that tim
e, it was the thing to do. 
You didn't talk to your children about -- I 
know we covered the telephone. We th ought 
somebody was listening in . This 
was in the late '30s. And I went to a German grade 
school, and the teacher was very anti-Nazi. I 
think because they to
ld them that songs 
which were forbidden, famous song, and had 
two ch ildren who th ey sent to Switzerland; 
so they would not have to 
go into the Germany Hitler Y
outh Movement. But Nuremberg 
was extremely antisemitic always. And I was -- 
since my  father had been in the World 
War I and fought at the front, I was -- the Je
wish children whose parents fought, their 
fathers fought in the front, th
ey were allowed to go to Germ
an high school. I refused to 
go, because I knew what was going
 on more than my parents. 
All of my friends went to 
the Jewish high school, which was very diffi
cult to get into. You had to pass an exam. I 
don't know how I did it. I copied somebody el
se's notes. Got in when  I was 10 years old 
and managed to graduate. We were forced to
 graduate with an equivalency of a high 
school exam at the ag e of 15. That is when
 schools shut down. It was a very orthodox 
school, where I learned -- we had Hebrew every 
day. I learned nothing. I had a good life.  
I had a good social life there.
 And then somehow or other, I got to -- my  parents got me 
on the Kindertransport. I remember my father 
coming to Berlin and saying, you are going 
to immigrate to England. Sounded great to me
. Anything to get out at that time. Berlin 
was not as bad as Nu remb erg, because, of c
ourse, there was more of an international 

community there. So I was sent to England on 
a ship. I remember, as 
I said, being on the 
-- my  mo ther pushed me on the train. That was 
it. Nothing told -- all 
she said, you forgot 
your washcloth. Go t on the train with a bunc
h of other kids. And the Nazi officer came  
through just before we got to 
th e Dutch border. And he said 
-- I had a watch, a very cheap 
watch. An d he said, a Jewish kid doesn't ne
ed a watch, and he took my  watch. I had 
nothing. We got to Holland. Th
ey gave us hot chocolate. Some people can reme mb er the 
ship. I have no recollections of how I ended 
up in London where 
I was taken in by a 

Jewish family arranged through 
relatives my  mother had in England, I think, who were 
pretty poor. They were -- the woman, she 
was a young woman, very volatile. One minute 
she would hug me and kiss me, the next minu
te she'd hit me. And she had a little boy. I 
took care of him. I used to -- now he calls me
 all the time. Now he is 70. We are still in 
touch. He called me. He got in touch with me, 
I have to add, ten years ago. He wanted to 
know wh at happened . I don't discuss this thing.
 I don't discuss it. And I lived with him for 
a year and a half until I was in
terned at the Isle of Man. 
Because I was 15 when Holland 
and Belgium and France were in
vaded, and we were consider
ed enemy aliens. And I was 
not yet 16. So we had to  pass 
a tribunal at the age of 16. 
I was -- I don't know how I got 
there. I was at the Isle of Man, which was 
an interesting experience in itself. I was there 
for nine months. You want me to tell the story?  
 
Q: Yes.  
 
A: It's about the spy.
 
Q: That's okay. If you could, please.
 
 A: We were put up in a hotel. And we ha
d a house committee. Of course, I thought it 
was fantastic. I was th ere. I was 1 6  years old.
 I didn't have to do a thing. Read all day 
long, went to the beach, had a good time. A
nd th e food wasn't bad. We were not being 
bombed. And th ere is a place on the Isle of 
Man, there's a holiday 
camp. It's a resort 
areA: And they had stationed Ge
rman nuns there. German n
uns were interned there, I 
think about 19 or 20. And they 
all had separate camps, becau
se they were very devout 
nuns. They were all comp letely covered. And 
for the fun of it, we used to count them 
every mo rning. They  were praying ev ery mo rni
ng on the beach. And to
 backtrack, when I 
was -- I remember lig hts coming, flickering back
 and forth at night. And I mentioned it to 
somebody that I see these lights all the time. It 
must be -- are they 
German ships, or are 
they British search lights or whatever. N
obody took any notice.
 I don't know what 
happened . But one day I saw, in
stead of 20 nuns, there were only 19. So  wh at happened  
to the other nun. There's a nun missing. And it tu
rned out, that particul
ar nun, I found that 
out only much later after I was released, a 
German spy had parach
uted. They used to 
parachute. This was in the early '4 0s. They 
parachuted spies into 
England and disguised 
as whatever. This guy was disguised as a 
nun and tried to get o
ff the Isle of Man by 
signaling to Ireland. And a week  later, I was 
released. I was not told  why. But I only 
found out later, I don't reme mb er how, that he 
was a spy, and he was 
frantic trying to get 
out. So that was it.  
 
Q: Could you please tell us a litt
le bit about your earlier life
 in Germany, and maybe also 
about any anti-Semitism that you personally 
experienced or that you witnessed.  
 
A: I experienced a lot of anti-Semitism pretty early on, as I said. I h ad very curly, very 

kinky hair. They  called it Jude
n Haare. My brother, who did 
not have it, didn't have any 

problem at all, because he had -- he was rather
 Slavic looking. And 
he could have easily 
passed for the Hitler youth, while I did not.
 And I remember walking out very often 
having ro ck s thrown at me. However, I had go
od German friends whose parents -- I was 
invited to  birthday parties. All this stopped 
around 1934. Then  people got scared. You 
know, they wouldn't -- 
I still have pictures of birthday 
parties where I was invited, and 
there was -- we had carnival. We were dressed 
up in co stume and stuff. I have pictures of 
that with my  German friends. And that st
opped around 1934, '35, because the parents 
actually got scared, except one. We had a family
 living -- we lived in an apartment house, 
had a big ap artment. My parents and my  uncl
e lived with us. There 
was a family, he was 
a count. And they were pretty 
decent. I think, if I remember, 
they did invite us and talked 
to my parents and didn't greet us with "He
il Hitler". But I was more
 aware -- I don't think 
I was more aware, but I was anxious not to go 
to a German school and forced my  parents 
to send me to a Jewish school by the simp le
 method -- I was 10 years old. I drank a whole 
bottle of castor oil on the day of the exam. That
 way I don't have to go. I did not take the 
exam. Because you had to pass an exam to go 
to high school. And in Germany, you went 
to high school at age 10 for six years. I went  t o  this Jewish high sc
hool, where my grades 
were very mediocre, except in sports and in 
socializing. And I belonged to a Jewish youth 
group in Berlin, and we had a great time, 
because we stayed en closed, you know. We 

were very mu ch protected by our parents. As
 far as possible they protected us. However, 
children realize things that they don't tell th
eir parents either. We tried to protect our 
parents, too. My brother was too young. I d
on't reme mb er mu ch . He 
was just a nuisance, 
as far as I'm concerned, at that time.  
 
Q: And what do you think that you might have 
noticed that your parents weren't seeing as 
a child?  
 
A: That were what?  
 
Q: Do you have an ex ample of something you 
feel that you were noticing th at maybe you 
were saying that you were prot
ecting your parents a little bit?  
 
A: Yes, by not telling th em that people attacked
 me on the street. I didn't tell them that. I 
found another way of going. I did not tell them
 that I read Der Sturmer, whichever. I was 

an avid reader, in fact, to th
e extent that I was told by 
my mother, stop that incessant 
reading an d do something. So I bought a Sturme
r or I found a Sturmer, and I hid it, and I 
read it. And it was totally the 
mo st horrendous thing. And as I said, to this day, I cannot 
understand how a people
 of so-called literate, cultured pe
ople can read pornographic stuff 
like that. There was somebody in our co mmun
ity, I don't -- I only remember th e name.  
His name was Katzenberger, was accused of 
Rassenschande because he had a Chekhov 
girlfriend. And wh at happened to  him, I don't 
know, something rather awful. And all of 
this was in Der Sturmer.  
 

Q: Can you talk about your
 brother a little bit.  
 
A: Yes. My brother was -- he was 3 years younge
r than I was, very a
ttached to me. To me 
he was a nuisance, because he read my diar
y. And he was sent to
 -- I was already in 
England when I found out. But after the war 
broke out, they managed to -- my  parents 
managed to get him out to Palestine, wher
e I have my  uncle and my  aunt and my 
mo ther's brother lived and my  co usin. All our 
relatives w ere in Palestine already, the ones 
who had survived . And he told  me this only 
later on. He was sent -- he and two other 
children, ages 12, 11 and 13, he was 12 years 
old, were put on a train to Trieste, where 
they were supposed to get a sh
ip to Palestine. And when th
ey got to Trieste, the ship 
wasn't there. I ask him, this is not long ago,
 a few years ago, what did you do. He said, I 
don't reme mb er. They mu st have wandered th e 
streets of Trieste. I don't know what they  
did. After about three or four days, the sh
ip came. They got on th
e ship. He told me, 
nothing -- he has no recollection of it. And all of
 the letters that my parents wrote, he has 
them. Now, I have to say, what I do now, as
 a volunteer, I work for the -- I do translations 
for the Leo Baeck Institute. And pr
esently, I'm also going to have
 -- I just finished a lot of 
translations for a pastor minister in Germ
any who published pamphlets for small towns, 
what happened for Jews who lived there fro
m the 12th Century on, just background of 
this particular village, and I translated all of 
that into English. That
 is what I'm doing at 
this point.
 
Q: That's g reat.
 
A: They asked me to come to Germany ne
xt year to see -- for the publication.  
 
Q: Oh, that's great.  
 
A: I got a little sidetracked. What were we talking about?
 
Q: About your brother.  
 
A: About my  brother, yes. He has the letters 
of my  parents, which 
I could have -- should 
have translated. I can 't  do it. He speaks English 
fluently. So he can hand
le this. I left it to 
him. I never discuss this with my -- I never sh
owed it to my children.
 They couldn't  read 
it anyway. They are in German. But I did read 
two letters from my mother. That was all.  
When  I was -- about 1939, '40, they wrote 
to these people very concerned about me, 
because I was 15 years old, what would ha
ppen to me. And also, I was at a very 
vulnerable age. What kind of trouble can I ge
t into. In fact, I was sent to America with 
the following sex education. Wh en you go out 
with a boy, keep walking, and don't sit 
down. That was it. That's all.
 That's all I learn ed. And th
at came in very handy. After 
Dunkirk, I met a young guy who was from Vie
nna, and we went out.
 We went to the 
park, and we sat on the bench. And then, I 
found out what they were talking about.  
 
Q: Yes. Yes.  
 

A: That was my sex education. That was,
 to me, unforgivable how little we knew. You 
know, that was those days, just not good en ough.  
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And then  my  parents, I f
ound out my  parents were deporte
d very  early on. And I didn't 
tell anybody. I had -- my  mo ther had a cousin
 in Sweden. And I don
't rememb er, I think 
he wrote. He told my  aunt, who was my  mo ther
's aunt, my great aunt what happened.  He 
found out that my  parents were deported im
mediately to Sobibor and that they were 
gassed within three weeks after 
they got there. And I didn't 
tell anybody because I could 
not, simp ly cannot handle, and not to this day, a
ny kind of pity. I didn't want any -- this is 
my  business, you know. My brother is the same
 way. My brother and my  sister-in-law, 
they lost a son in the war, in the Lebanese  war. My sister-in-law, who was Hungarian 
descent, was able to really let go, and he didn't
. We'r e just too inhibited,
 to this day. So be 
it. It's  nothing. I don't apologize for it. You 
know that is how we were made, in a way, 
how we were brought up. Pretty unemotional, 
which made it difficult, but also was a help 
at times.  
 
Q: And do you -- maybe 
you don't reme mb er if we had ta
lked about it -- if you reme mb er 
the Kindertransport?  
 
A: The Kindertransport, yeah, I remember
 coming to England. You know, the people 
who took me in, they were, in a way, they were very -- I spoke very little -- v ery little; I 

spoke no English. I spoke whatever English I 
learned in school. And they invited people, 
young people to the house who lived nearby 
so that I learned English. And I learned 

English by playing Monopoly and not speaki
ng a single -- nobody spoke German. They 
took me to the movies, and that was How Gr
een was My Valley, and within six months I 

spoke English. I was sent to a school. In En
gland, you went to a private school. You 
didn't  go to public school. Of co urse, ther
e was no money. Ho wever, there was -- school 
was impossible. You could get a teacher certifi
cate by finishing high school. And I went 
to a school, Pitkin (ph.). I got a uniform, a
nd I got a hat and a unifo rm, the whole bit.  
And I met a young girl there who became my
 friend and whose parents owned a pub.  
And we'v e been friends. We were friends all 
our lives until she died last year. A nd I do 
remember, they were talking -- 
the first two or three weeks 
I was in school, they were 
talking about somebody called Enemy. Now, 
my  cousin's  name was Anime (ph.). And I 
said, why do they keep ta
lking about Anime, Anime. 
That was the only wo rd I 
understood. But within six mont
hs, I spoke fluent English, and until I came to America, I 
spoke English without an acce
nt, with a British accident. I said buttuh instead of butter. 

That was my -- the people were not bad. It
 was okay. But I was always the outsider, no 
question about it. And they al
ways -- and people started feeling sorry for me. And many 
years later, when I went back 
to England with my  husband after my  children were grown, 
I bought all new clothes. I wore all the jewelr
y I had, wh ich wasn't a lot, to show that I 

made it. And there were -- because I felt so 
inferior, and they had 
-- the people I lived 
with after I came out of the internment camp
, was the sister of the woman befo re, which 
was very strict, very clean a
nd very  neat. They had three daughters, one my  ag e and twin s 
who were two years younger. One was deaf. So
 I had -- she was totally deaf. But they 
were pretty good. The husband was very co
mpassionate. The wife less so. She was very 
demanding. But I learned a lot. I learned ho
w to be a mar v elous house cleaner, best 
cleaner in the world. 
 
Q: Do you want to talk 
a little bit more about your 
time on the Isle of Man?  
 
A: The Isle of Man, yes. The house comm
ittee, the story of the house committee. Ms. 
Brahms, I think her name was Abraham, she 
became Ms. Brahms, called me one day. Oh , 
there was another story. I was by far the you
ngest. I was six years younger than the next 
young woman. There were only women th er
e. And th ere was two women who were 
always fighting. On e was from Vienna, and 
the other one was from Berlin. I found out 
afterwards they were prostitutes. And I got 
sick. I had the flu. And these women were 
desperate for children. They wa
nted to take care of me. So they  both came, and they 
came with a hot water bottle. One came with 
hot water. And they 
were screaming and 
fighting. I was lying in bed pretty sick. I 
think I had flu. And one opens the hot water 

bottle and pours the water over the other one. But I recovered and recuperated. I was like 
a pet to them really, so. And life wasn't bad on 
the Isle of Man. And then I came back to 
London. I started working first in dressmak
ing, supposed to be a dressmaker. T o tally 
unsuitable for it. Totally hated it. And then got 
a job. I wanted to go -- oh, yes. I wanted 
to go to the ATS, but I wasn't old enough. 
I was 17. They had a gi
rl's training course, 
something. However, for some reason, my re
latives wouldn't let me
. I don't know wh at 
say they had over the matter. No, you can't
 go to the ATS, too many men around or 
whatever. So  I ended up in a factory wo rking 
four years, and I did 
a good job. I started 
out as a toolmaker's helper. An
d then one day I was promoted 
to a very big machine that 
had just arrived from America, a milling ma
chine came from Pittsburgh, size of this 

room. And I was making little bloc
ks. And I got a wide apron, learning how to do this. I 
was 18 years old. And they had 
a minister of -- the war mini
ster, and they were showing 
him the factory. Ms. Heiman, will you dem
onstrate the milling machine. I demonstrated 
the milling machine showing o
ff, put my finger right through
 it and cut off half my 
finger. I still have no sensation. So after 
that, I couldn't  work
 for a while on the 
machinery, because I could only
 use one hand. So they put 
me on sorting out stuff with 
old people of 30 and 40, and I worked. And th
en I was promoted. I became -- I'm not that 
stupid; so I don't have to sit there all day.
 I became an instrume
nt inspector. And we 
made some thing to do, put into  planes, airp
lanes. And I worked there for close to 60 
hours a week with overtime. Not bad. Made
 good friends. Learne
d a lot about life from 
ordinary people, very , very or
dinary people and had very -- I 
always say, my  best friends 
were the British, the ordinary working class people. They were kind
. They didn't question 

me about my  background. They  
were never judgmental. And if 
it hadn't been -- if I hadn't 
met my husband, I would still be in Engla
nd. I would now be an
 English woman.  
 
Q: And can you tell me the story 
of how you met your husband.  
 
A: Yes. My husband -- as I say, no nice girl
 went out with an America, you know. They  
had a reputation. They were called overpaid , 
over here and oversexe
d. So you didn't  go 
out. You know, you had to be introduced. You 
had to  be very careful. And my husband 
was -- I had two cousins who were distant rela
tives of mine. I met o n e when they came.  
They were stationed in London. And I met Mart
y. He was ten years older than  I was. He 
knew me because he was 14 when I was 4, bu
t I didn't  know him. And his family had 
given him my address, and we met. And that's
 another story. Piccadilly was an American 
-- a club for the American soldiers, and ther
e was a newsstand there. And I'm standing 
there waiting for Martin. I didn
't know wh at he looked  like. The lady who owned the 
newsstand said, you can't stand th
ere. I said, why not. It's so
mebody else's stand. I said, I 
have a right like anybody else. I didn't know 
th at Piccadilly was a place especially for 
prostitutes. So she said, young 
lady, I'll advise you; move.  
 
Q: Oh, no.  
 
A: And I don't know. I met him. Somehow we
 met. And we only  spent a few days 

together because he was sent overseas. That 
was it. And then he wrote me during the war.  
We kept in touch, but I had 
another boyfriend. He was enga
ged to somebody else. That's 
a long -- he was engaged to a girl in Argentin
A: I had a boyfriend in England, but that 
broke up. And we got -- he got 
-- we came to AmericA: We couldn't get a ship because 
we were called GI issues. We were only fiances. On the same ship came -- we came over 
on a ship  and landed  here January 1, 1947, 
they had a bunch of Ge
rman war brides who 
had children who were already married to Am
ericans. And there were the British girls 
and the German girls. They  had to separate 
us. Fights broke out. We were furious that 
they let the Germans on while 
we had to wait for a year to
 get to America, while the 
Germans came. So that was quite a to-do. An
d the ship, I remember 
the steward said to 
us, young ladies, you don't know what you are 
in for. I take as many of you back as I 
bring over.  
 
Q: Oh, wow.  
 
A: It happened very frequen
tly. I met one guy, I met a man, a soldier from Kentucky.  
And he co uldn't read or write. He said, the fi
rst time he had ever wo rn shoes was in the 
Army . So th ese young girls from England, they 
all looked alike, and they all had money.  
So that was -- and I came here, and my parent
s owned -- my parents-in-law -- my father-
in-law was a cousin of my 
father. And they owned a chic
ken farm in New Jersey, in 
Lakewood. And we came here. We
 got married in March '47.  
 

Q: Could you talk a little bit about the war.  
 
A: About what?  
 
Q: About the war.  
 
A: The war, yes. It was, at times, it was fri
ghtening. I remember, I was not there. I missed  
most of the blitz. However, the British were
 always very calm. And I remember the 
outbreak of the war, where we liv
ed, I lived with this family
 Robinson. Acro ss the street 
lived a family, a man and a wife, called At
kinson. And the British were very calm.  
Noth ing ever shook them. And on the -- I th
ink it was the 3rd of September, when the 
war broke out, I was sick. I threw up, and I ca
me back. Everybody, let's have a cup of 
teA: And Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson came over and 
sat down to  have tea, very calm. And  
Mrs. Atkinson had a coat on. And she opened 
her coat, and sh e was totally nude. She was 
a nudist. They were nudists, a
nd she forgot to get dressed. 
That is how they show their 
excitement. I remember, she quickly went like 
that. She had forgotten to get dressed.  
 
Q: Wow.  
 
A: That was the outbreak of the war. And an ot
her scary thing, I was out on a date, also 
with a distant relative, a cous
in, an American officer. We 
were in London in Leicester 
Square. Now, I saw subways here like that, w
ith an enormous long escalator. We were 
going up an escalator. Air raid siren had just 
stopped, and another one started. And that's 
the only time I saw British panic, the people
 were going up the escal
ator, other people 
going down .  Everybody fell back
ward.  And fortunately, this
 guy held up ten people.  
Otherwise, we would have all been killed. We 
did have a shelter in the house, a table like 

this, a heavy table. We were supposed to 
sit under the table. And the children were 
evacuated. I was not evacu
ated. I didn't  want to. I was ol
d enough. I stayed in London, on 
the outsk irts. You know, it was scary. And I 
rememb er, the Robinsons, whose original 
name was Robinowitz, said at the big outb reak
 of the war, if the Nazis -- if the Germans 
set foot in England, we 'r e going to turn  on 
the gas. That I remember. We did not starve.  
We had enough food. Except, I weighed 30 po
unds mo re then than  I do now, because we 
ate a lot of bread and potatoes. And since I work
ed  in a factory, we got extra rations. I got 
extra rations. And we got fo od rations, coupons,
 and clothing coupons. I sold my  clothing 
coupons for sweets. I'd rather
 having candy than clothes.
 
Q: That's a good ideA
: I think I would do that
, too. Maybe then, let'
s then jump
 a little bit 
ahead to your life in the 
United States. Do you want to talk about that?  
 
A: I had a good life. I came, as I said, got 
married. We used my  husband's pay to buy a 
house. It was impossible to get an apartmen
t, and I had a good -- as I said, my  uncle 
insisted that I come to Pales
tine, and my  husband too, to se
e my  brother and my family.  
And I was just married  three months, and I left. 
I have all of the letters. That was not easy 

to be -- it was a long trip in those days to go 
to Palestine. It was like three weeks. We had 
a change in Genua, stuff like 
that. And so I was gone. And th en, when I came back, we -- 
my  husband was in the spice business. He 
worked  for a spice comp any. We had two 
children. My  son is now 61 years old. 
My  daughter is 58, and I have grown 
grandchildren. And we had a wonderful life un
til he died ten years ago. He was 83 when 
he died. He had a stroke. And 
we had a very  good life together. What attracted me to him 
at the time was also as a father. He was very 
protective. He took care of everything. I felt 
-- I was very anxious that someone would take 
care of me, instead of having to take care 
of myself. And yet, I was still very
 independent. I got a job.   
 
Q: Your children or your gran
dchildren, do you talk about 
your experiences with them?  
A: My children, to some exte
nt. My grandchildren, not at 
all.  They don 't eve n  know.  
That is why I just bought a book
. Not at all. Both of my gr
andsons live in Pittsburgh right 
now. On e is a web designer, and the other on
e is going in to physic
al therapy. Never. 
Even my daughter complained ab
out the fact that I never talk
 about it. And she said, all I 
ever learned -- she was in Isr
ael. She spent two years in Isra
el. And she said, everything I 
learned about wh at happened  is from your
 brother, from my  brother, not from me. I 
wanted to  get on with my  life. I did not want 
to dwell on the past. It was my fault up to a 
point, but I didn't  want to. And my husband ta
lked to th em about it, but I didn't even tell 
him everything. That was my  shtic
k. It was just too difficult.  
 
Q: Thank you fo r sharing. And 
is there anything else that you would like to add, or is 
there a memory or --   
 
A: All I can say is, always -- it's
 what I said in my last interv
iew too. People have to learn 
to be tolerant of each other. I get terribly, 
terribly upset when I se
e what is going on now 
with the gays, with this -- anybody who is diffe
rent, different color, different persuasion.  
As long as you are a decent human bein
g an d don't hurt anybody else, you can do 
whatever you want, as far as 
I'm concerned. In tolerance, 
and the ad vantage I think we 
have in America is that it's not a homogen
ous society. There are so many cultures, so 
many religions. We'v e got to acce
pt them. You can do what 
you want. Leave me alone.  
But be to lerant toward s other people. I go to the -- we have in New York  -- I don't know 

if you've heard of it, The Ho locaust Tole
rance Center, The Tolerance Museum, and my  
emphasis is on tolerance. That 
is what you have to teach 
children and not be bullies and 
not look down on other people's 
color or because they are a different race or a different 
background or a different education.  
 
Q: Great. Anything else?  
 
A: I can't think of anything else.  
 
Q: Thank you. Thank you so mu ch .  
 

A: You're welcome.

Q:   This is a continuation of an interv
iew with  Ruth Heiman
 on October 17, 2010, 
regarding th e Kindertransport. Please go ahead.  
 
A: The interview yesterday I left out the most
 important thing to me that I pushed out of 
my  mind all along. When my  son was born, when
 I was in the hospital giving birth to my  
son, I was furious at my mother for not bei
ng there. And I needed her so mu ch. I was 24 
years old. She had been killed six years earlier.  
 
Q: I want to thank y
ou for sharing that.  
 
A: I knew that, but nevertheless, I never got 
over the anger. How could she leave me at a 
time like that. Totally irrational. My husba
nd was there, of course. It was totally 
irrational. I never forget it. This 
was '49. She was killed in '43.  
 
Q: Did she die in a concentration camp?  
 
A: My parents went in 
1942 to a death camp. Th
at is the addition.  
 
Q: Thank you very much.  
 
A: You're welcome.
