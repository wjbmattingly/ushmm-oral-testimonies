Question:  I'd like you to star
t by telling me  your name , when were you born, and where you  
        were born? 
Answer:  I'm Marianne Rosner.  I was bor
n in Vi enna on the 21st of October 1910. 
Q. And what was your birth name ?  

A. Marianne , but my second birth na me  was Robczek (ph.). 

Q. Tell me  a little bit about your
 fa mily life like in Vi enna? 
A. My fa mily life was beautiful, just beautiful
.  I had very good parents.  I had a sister.  My 
father was a well-to-do businessman in Vie
nna.  And I had the mo
st beautiful childhood 
and youth life that ever you can image.  A
nd I was very young when I me t my husband.  
And when I was 19 years old, we got ma rried 
in 1930 in Vienna.  We  are 65 years.   
Q. Was your family religious? 

A.  No.  No.  We were Jews, good Jews.  But not religious. 

Q. Did you mi x with Christian people? 

A. A lot.  A lot.  We  were together in school
.  My best friends were 
Christian.  Customers in 
my father's  business were Christians.  It ma de
 no difference.   As a ma tter of fact, I never 
met any antisemismus (ph.) in Vienna; I met only antisemismus in Poland.  I never met 

any in Vienna to my ti me.  I left Viennain 1930.  You know, that 
was a long time before 
the Hitler anschlus (ph.). 
Q. What else can you tell me about your background in Vienna? 

A. My background in Vienna was a good, simple life
 with a nice fa mily.  I went to school.  I 
went to -- I have only 2 years of college.  I 
didn't want to study.  I only wanted to go out 
with boys and have a good time.  There's not 
muc h to say there, just a norma l, nor ma l 
good life.   
Q. You got ma rried in --

A. InVienna. 
Q. In Vienna in 1930? 

A. In1930. 

Q. And you left Vienna. 

A.  I left Vienna in 1930.  Right away afte
r the wedding we left.  My husband was a 
musician, a violinist, a very fi
ne violinist, and we travelled 
a lot.  As long as we were 
young, we travelled a lot.  We  went to Roma ni
a, to Hungary, and to Poland.  And then 
we settled.  When my son was born in 1935, we
 settled in Wa rsaw.  My son was born in 

Warsaw, and there we settled, and there we were until the wa r broke out.  In 1939 the war 

broke out and caught us in Poland. 
Q. Now, when you were in Warsaw, were you 
aware of what was starting to happen in 
Germany?   
A. No.  No.  No.  We  didn't -- ma ybe becau
se we where young, and we didn't take life so 
very serious, you know.  But rather I would say, 
rather it was a surprise for us.  But it 
should come  to us.  All right.  We  hea r d a lo
t of things, what's happened to the Jews in 
Germany, you know, but we really never t
hought that was going to happen to us. 
Q. So you were aware that there were problems in Germany? 

A. Oh, yes.  Oh, yes. 

Q. Did you experience any anti-Sem
itism in Warsaw at that time? 
A. Yes, I did. 

Q. Forexample? 

A. For example, certain st ores you were not pe
rmitted to walk in.  In Warsaw, maybe not so 
much, but we were in Catelvich (ph.) which is
 a ni ce city.  There was a sign on the street 
-- I have to translate it into 
English.  It was in Polish there.  The saying wa s, "don't buy 
anything by Jews.  Jews are you enemies."  
And there were signs on doors like barber 

shops.  Jews -- not allowe d.  Things like this 
are very, very, very sad -- very sad.  This 
time you felt very, very uncomfortable.

Q. Did you feel things were changing and getting worse for Jews? 
A. Of course, of course.  Of c
ourse we felt this.  Sure, sure. 
Q. Where were you living when the Nazis 
-- when the Germans came into Poland? 
A. We were living in Krakow. 

Q. You had left Wa rsaw? 

A. We left Wa rsaw before we were living in 
the ghetto.  And before the ghetto was closed 
completely, we run away from the ghetto -- 
from Warsaw, and we went to Krakow.  
Krakow -- only Krakow we couldn't stay eith
er.  We had to move 30 kilome ters away 
fr om  Krakow, in the country.  And we were
 living there.  And then the ghetto was built 
in Krakow.  When the ghetto was built in Krakow, we had to move back from the country 

to the ghetto to Krakow. 
Q. What -- how did things come  about 
that you had to move to the country? 
A. Because we didn't want to be closed in in 
the ghetto in Wa rsaw.  We  didn't want to st ay 
in the ghetto -- do you know you had 
to stay in the ghetto even 
if you didn't  want to.  We 
know what some  of the things that might happe
n.  We  had to react 
to the sign of David.  
And we took this off, and we traveled in the 
train like -- not Jews.  
And that's the way we 
went to the country. 
Q. I'm confused about something.  If you were
 in Krakow when the Germans came in -- 
A. Yes. 

Q. There was already a ghetto in Wa rsaw? 

A. No.  There was filth, and it was a ghetto, bu
t an open ghetto.  There was a section of the 
city which was meant for the Jews to move 
in there, but it wa s ope
n, you could still go 
out -- you know out. 
Q. This was before the war started? 

A. No.  No.  No. 

Q.   Okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm confused. 
 The reason that I'm confused is because when 
the German troops came in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312

A. Yes? 
Q. Were you in Wa rsaw or in Krakow?    

A. Krakow. 

Q.  You were in Krakow? 

A. Yes.  Then we moved.  But you know I had 
my apartment in Wars
aw.  I was living in 
Warsaw before my son was born.  From 
1935 until 1939, I was living in Warsaw.  I had 
an apartment, and I had a normal life.  But 
then when the German ca me  in, my husband 
had a contract as a violinist in Krakow. 
Q. As a violinist? 

A.  A band leader, yes.  Okay, a band leader.   

Q. InWarsaw? 

A. A band leader.  Yes, his ba
nd and he has a contract in Krakow.  That's  how we ca me  
from Wa rsaw to Krakow.  And then when th
e contract ended, and the Germans ca me in, 
and the contract was no good anymore.  Jews di
dn't  play anymore.  We  went back to 
Warsaw.  We had to mo ve into the ghetto.  Now, it's a new year, reme mb er.  But then 

when they sa id that  the ghetto was going to be
 closed, we left.  We  left, and we went -- 

his parents were in Krakow, a
nd his brothers and sister, so 
they want to be with the 
fa mily.  So we went there, and then
 we had to move away from Krakow. 
Q. Okay.  I think I understand now
.  When -- can you describe to
 me  what it was like when 
the Germans came?   Do you reme mb er that? 
A. Do I reme mber that?   Of course I reme mber 
that.  It was very bad, it was very sad.  It was 
-- no stores, Jews couldn't have no (sic) st
ores.  There were no -- nobody could go to 
school anymore.  There were no jobs for 
Jews whatsoever.  They couldn't earn any 
money.  As a ma tter of fact the mone y 
was taken away.  And the bank -- the bank 
counters were closed for the Jews.  You know
, it was a very sad, very mi serable time. 
Q. Wa s it fr ightening?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312

A. Of course it was frightening. 
 Of course.  It was frightening, 
sure it was frightening.  The 
Germans took away men from the streets, you 
know, just because th
ey were Jews.  And 
they put them already then
 in concentration camps.  
Q. Did they bomb Krakow at all? 
A. Yes, they bombed Krakow, but not to bad, 
not to bad.  The  first attack it was boom, 
boom.  We went to the shelter.  And this 
time  I was living on Prove
nska Olsa (ph.).  We 
went to the shelter.  My boy was in this tim
e four years old, you know.  So it was pretty -- 
we didn't have too much money.  We  were
 young and we didn't run away.  A lot of 
people run away, you know.  Not that we did an
y good with that, but we didn't run away.  
We didn't think that it wa s going to come  to 
that, but it did come  to it.  You know, we 
didn't think that it was going to come  to c
oncentration camps and th
ings like this.  We 
didn't believe it.  
Q. What was the local reaction to the Germans comi ng in? 

A. The local reaction?  Some of them, they like
d it.  Some  of them, they didn't.  The Poles 
by themselves -- some  of them didn't  like Je
ws.  Some  of them, they were very good to 
Jews.  Some  of them hel ped saving their lives
, and some  of them helped destroying them.  
You know, like in ever country they
 have good people and bad people. 
Q. Did you have any experiences with Polis
h people that you knew or that you husband 
knew?  
A.  No.  Not bad experience whatsoever.  No. 

Q. So who all went to the country?   Who we
nt to the country when you had to leave? 
A.  When we went to the country my husband, 
myse lf, my child of c
ourse, his brother, and 
his parents were living there.  We  all were th
ere in a little town.  We  even used to ma ke 
some  money there.  He used to play fo
r the governor there, you know, when the -- 
Q. Did the local admi nistration tell you to l
eave, or you just knew you had to get out? 
A. There was a law, no.  There was a law.  We  
had to leave.  They put sign on the streets and 
the houses that we had to leave.  We
 didn't want to leave.  We had to.

Q. When was it? 
A. It was a short time after the Germans o
ccupied Krakow, a short time after.  I don't 
reme mber exactly the time, you know. 
Q. They were trying to get 
the Jews out of the city? 
A. Yes.  Yes.  They wanted a UdenRhine (ph.) clean of Jews city. 

Q. So you stayed in this country town for -- what
 was the name  of it?   What was the name of 
it?

Q. Were there any Jews where you move d to
?   Did you know that there were no Jews? 
A. In this town where were we
 came to, there were no Jews. 
Q. Do you know of any othe
r Jews that lived there? 
A. Okay.  In the this town, in Perhovesay, we
 went to their -- I don't know how ma ny ye ars 
ago, sixty years, there were no Jews living 
there.  And when we came  there, and you 
know that we are Jews, they didn't believe it,
 that the Jews looked like normal people, 
you know. 
Q.  Did the people there like you? 

A. Some  of them like us and they help us to 
stay there.  We stayed there until we had to 
move from t here.  We had to move fr om th
ere and we had to go to the ghetto.  In the 

meanti me  in Krakow we prepared a ghetto. 
 The war was around the ghetto and we had 
we had to move to the ghetto.  All Jews 
from the surrounding from Krakow had to mo ve 
to the ghetto.  So they liked us, and they ha
d us stay there until we had to move from 
there.  We  had to move from there, and we had to go to the ghetto.  In the meantime, in 

Krakow, they prepared a ghetto.  They put 
a wall around the ghetto, and we  had to mo ve 
to the ghetto.  All Jews from the surroundings 
from Krakow had to move to the ghetto. 
Q.  And this was when? 

A. This was -- I would say '41 or '42, some
thing like that.  1941 or '42, I don't reme mber 
exactly the dates.  I don't want
 to give you the wrong dates.

wagons, we put our stuff on the wagon, and we 
went to the ghetto.  
It wa s not far from 
Krakow ma ybe an hour.  We  got from th
e Jewish committee or organization, I don't 
know -- we got an apartment -- an apartment.  We were living in a five-room apartment 

with ten families.  We  were living in one r
oom wi th Henry's sister, brother-in-law, two 
children.  They were four people, and we we
re three is seven, and 
one sister-in-law, a 
single girl.  Eight peopl
e, we were living, eating, sleeping 
-- living in this one room.  And 
in each room of this apartment, this was the 
apartment of a doctor.  Doctor in good time s, 
but he had a dental -- a dental 
office there.  In every room was  just as ma ny people.  In 
the hallway was living a fa mily.  It was ver
y, very congested, very crowded.  We  had a 
little iron st ove in the mi ddle of the room.  And there we cooked. That was our life until 

they opened _________ -- in the beginning Abbe
tslager (ph.).  And then it became a 
concentration camp.  Until we went there, that was about in 1943, '42, '43, 
something like that. 

Q. Were you working while living in the ghetto? 

A. No.  Yes -- I was ma king money.  We  had fr
iends and relatives, which -- men, which like 
to play cards.  So in the evenings, we cam
e up there up to my room, and five, six, seven 
me n to play poker, or whatever they coul
d play.  And I cooked coffee, and I ma de 
sandwiches, and I baked cake, and I served them
, and them and they paid me  for it.  This 
is how I ma d a few dollars.  My husband used to
 work there, too.  There was a little cafe 
or restaurant were he used to play with thisorchestra.  It was a small orchestra, but it was 

an orchestra.  The Germans permitted that.

Q. And was this just for the Jewish people? 

A. Just the Jewish people, ye s.  

Q. And was it easy to get the food that
 you were cooking?   Wa s there enough? 
A.   No, it wasn't  easy, but you could get it.  In the back ma rket -- you know people, the 
Polish people, they smuggled it in.  There 
were some  black ma rkets, you know, you had 

to pay a lot of money for ever
ything, but you could get it.  Yo

fact, my son didn't know how to write or 
read until he came  to America.     
Q. Were there any political  
organizations in the ghetto? 
A. No, not that I know of.  No.

people who took advantage of their position, 
you know.  And there were nice ones, too, 
which like to help.  You can't  put everybody 
together, you know.  There are always good 

and bad. 
Q. Was there access to the Polish side, or
 did you have to stay in the ghetto? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312  
9 
 
A. There were access, but you had to have a permit to leave the ghetto.  When you had to 
leave you at least had to have a reason to 
leave, so you had to apply for permission to 
leave.  Sometimes you got it, sometimes you didn't . 
Q. For work or for what?  
A. Work.  Wor k.  Yes.  Wo rk -- there were gr
oups of Jews which worked for Germans.  My 
husband, for example, got a group which work 
for the Luftkow (ph.) Commando.  It was 
some  organization for fliers.  I don't know what
 it is.  And he had a group for cleaning the 
offices, and doing things like this.  So he we
nt out every day from the ghetto.  In the 

morning, he went out, and he 
come  back in the evening. 
Q. Were you always sure that he was going to come  back? 

A. No.  No.  I wasn't  sure he was going to co
me  back, and he wasn't  sure that he was going 
to find me .  But there were actions in the ghe
tto in which they killed the people in the 
ghetto, and there were actions outside of
 the ghetto.  You never know, you never know 

what the next hour is going to bring.    
Q. Can you describe for me  those actions? 

A. I don't think so -- you want to listen to this. 

Q. I think it's important.  Ca n you try?
  Just tell us what you reme mber. 
A. Just the actions.  They put the ol d people 
all together in the ma
rketpl ace, and they had 
buses there.  Between these people was my 
husband's parents.  They put them on the 
truck, and they pushed them out, a
nd you never saw them again.  ______________ in 
ma ssive -- you never saw them.  You never know 
where and when.  They were horrible.  
They took the children out, chil
dren, little children, two years,
 three years, four years.  
They put them on the trucks and they move
d them out.  The parents came back in the 
evening from work, and they didn't find their 
children anymore.  My nephew went this 
way.  My sister-in-law, his sist
er went together with this baby.  When she didn't want to 
let them go alone she went them.  Her husba
nd came  home , a nd he didn't find his wife 

and his child anymore.  I don't think anybody 
wants to listen to these things.

Q. This is important.  This an important as a 
testimony for history.  It is important that we 
know your pain. 
A. There was a hospital in the ghetto where they 
liquidated the hospital.  They just ki lled the 
patients.  The hospital -- they never came  out
 of t he hospital.  I was lucky, I came out of 
this hospital.  Some
how, I don't know how it came, but I wi
ll never forget.  I was in the 
entrance.  There was a mother with a child.  I 
think she had just gave birth in the hospital 
to this child.  And I went out there, and an
 SS ma n took this child by the legs, and he just 
hit him against a brick wall.  He pushed us asid
e, and then they went to the concentration 
camp.   
Q. How did you ma nage to keep your s
on?   I thought that was very hard. 
A.It was thanks to my husband.  Thanks to my husband, he -- it 
was known that he was a musician, and these people -- how 
bad they were, but they liked music, you know, and they 

found out that he was a musician.  And he played for the 

_________, he and his brother.  And he played for them, and 

they liked his music so much.  This how he saved -- he 

saved, and they know that he had a child, and they helped 

him.  The commandant, this murderer, he helped him save our 

child. 
Q. Did you have to hide him while you living in the ghetto? 

A. Yes.  Yes.  We had to send him out of the ghetto.  He let us know when there was an 
action going on in the ghetto, and we had to se
nd him out of t he ghetto. 
 He was out -- he 
was in different towns for some  time there.  A relative of ours was a police -- Jewish 

police that was high ranked, 
and he was there for a few weeks or months.  I don't 
reme mber how long.  And then the commandant 
said, "Bring him back, because there is 
going to be some thing there."   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312

 Barneya (ph.) was the name  of the town. 
 And that's -- there he met Schindler and 
commandant.  That's where he me t Schindler, 
and Schindler got a li
king to him, and he 
put us on the list, and we  we
nt to Brelitzer (ph.).   
Q.   Ok.  So let's -- I'm not jumping ahead.  But how long were you in the ghetto before you 
were sent out? 
A. I would say 1940 to 1943.  Maybe 
-- not quite a year I think. 
MR. ROSNER:  More. 
MRS. ROSNER:  What ? 

MR. ROSNER:  More. 

MRS. ROSNER:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
 No.  More than a year? 
MR. ROSNER:  More than two years. 

MRS. ROSNER:  No. 

MR. ROSNER:  It was a littl
e more than two years. 
MRS. ROSNER:  No.  I n '43 -- in '4 4 we left
 Plashau (ph.).  And we
 all about a year in 
Plashau, over a year, '43 couldn't be more than 
a year.  It was in '
41-'42 a bout a year.  
Yes, about a year. 
BY THE HI STORIAN: 

Q. At the time  that you were sent out 
of the ghetto, were you aware of camps  -- 
concentration camps and things like
 that?   Did you know about that? 
A. I heard about it!  I heard 
about it!  But some how, I don't know if I was an optimist or 
whatever.  I never thought that
 was going to come  to me , that I am going to be the one 
which -- I never thought about it.   
Q.   There were deportations from the ghettos before you left? 

A.  Yes, but not from the  -- not directly to Au
schwitz.    First we had to come  to Plashau, 
which was right next Krakow, you know.  Then 
fr om Krakow, then the transports went 
out. 
Q. Now, how did it come  to pass that you 
left the ghetto?   Tell me  what happened. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312  
12 
 
A. Well, the ________, the abetslager (ph.) wa
s ready, you know.  They
 ma de it out of a 
cemetery.  They made -- the they built the ba
rracks, and they ma de a concentration camp.  
When this was ready, when the barracks was ready, then all the Jews had to go there.  
Every day a certain amount.   Every day a certa
in amount we nt up there.
  It was, like, on 
a hill, you know.  And we got accomodation in some  barracks.  And I was chosen 

because I spoke German.  So I became
 a block______.  Block______, it was like a like 
house mother you know.  I had three-hundred wome n in my block, and I had to take care 

of -- that they should go out to
 work, and shouldn't run away, a
nd they should be there.  
But it was a very tough job. 
Q. Why was it a tough job? 

A. Because the wome n wanted to do their own 
way, you know.  They didn't want to listen.  
Everybody wanted to save themselves, and do the best for themselves, which wasn't  so 

easy.  So that was what it was like 
in any one of these houses here. 
Q. So how did you keep order in your -- 

A. I tried to.  I tried to explai n it to them
, and some how they listened to me , and some how 
we -- in all this time, only one woma n ra
n away.  One woman escaped, which I was 
punished for with twenty-five 
lashes on my behind, which was very painful, and very 

sicking for months.  And -- but I was lucky  
because it was actually a life threat.  
Actually, they said, "When some body runs aw
ay from you, you are going to be killed."  
So I was lucky that I got aw
ay with this twenty-five. 
Q. So whenever any of the people in your block did some thing wrong, you could be 
punished?  
A. The block_______ was responsible for it, yes. 

Q. Now, did you husband and son go to Plashau with you? 

A.   Yes.  Not with me , but they went to 
Plashau to.  He was in the me n.  The me n were 
separate.  Men were separate, and wome n were
 separate.  He was in the me n's block, and 
he had the child with him, until they sent him out of the lager (ph.).  He wasn't  too mu ch

in the lager.  They sent him out, tha

action, and we went out to wor
k.  When he was alone he hid 
himself -- he hid himself.  
Some how, he tells me  a story I didn't know about 
it, because I wasn't  there.  He tells me 
this story that some how he walked and he
 walked and he went up by some  nuns.  And 
they took him in, and they fed him, and he slep
t there.  And when he came  -- he found his 
way back to the ghetto, and everything wa
s over.  The action was over.  He saved 
himself. 
Q.  I see, that is some thing.

Q. And this was, I think, in March of 1943? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312

A. Some thing like that, yes. 
Q. And you knew where you were going? 

A. Yes.  We  knew we were going to Plashau. 
 I never was there befo
re.  I never was there 
before in my  life.   
Q. What were the conditions 
like in Plashau for living? 
A. We were living in a barrack, in a woode
n shack, which was three floors, you know, one-
two-three.  And there were 
straw sacks.  I don't reme mber, were there blankets?   No 
pillows of course.  The blankets were for th
e cold.  and there were latrines.  You know, 
latrines -- outhouses for ma ybe a hundred peopl
e, you know, one next to the other.  There 
was no sanitary condition whatsoever.  Once 
in a while, you had to bring your people -- 
your room a nd I had to bring them down to
 the shower.  You know
, there was a building 
like a __________ were they were looking for lic
e, and, you know, and things like that.  
And the wome n had a shower once in a while.  A piece of soap was rare.  Some  

smuggled it from outside.  A little piece of soap
 which everyone was permitted to use just 
a little bit.  And no to
ilet paper, no toothbrushes, no things
 like that to use --nothing.  We  
tore off from our dresses pieces and used th
em as toilet paper.  No running water or 
anything like this.  We  had to bring 
the water in a __________, you know.  Very bad, 
very bad, very bad.  You know, some times when
 I -- when I think back like this, on an 
occasion like this, I hardly can believe that 
this has happened.  So that's when I think, 
when I tell it to some body else who never was 
there, how can they ma ke any sens of the 

pictures, when I myself doubted that I could --
 I could live through th
is.  In the beginning, 
when I came to America, it was no use to talk 
to the American people and telling it then.  
They don't believe you anyway.  You can't  belie
ve it.  It's  too hard to believe.   
Q. Did they feed you?

me  soup, some  water, and some  would even

It didn't go.  Very bad.  In the morning, I had 
to take a woma n, I had to go to the kitchen.  
You had to bring this black wa ter which was 
supposed to be coffee, you know.  And then you 
give it to the woma n.  And then there 
was an appel (ph.) -- we had to take the wo
me n to the appelplatz 
(ph.), and they count 
you like gold.  We  went back then -- you had to
 go to the kitchen and bring the kettle 
with soup.  Some how -- some how I don't know 
how was it then.  Some  groups of my 
woma n began to work outside of the lager. 
 They came back in the evenings, and they 
smuggled in something sometimes, you know, something to eat.  They ma de some 
___________, you know, and they got some thing better to eat.  So some body who had 

yet a few dollars hide (sic) away so they
 could buy some thing.  There was the black

 in and spend the night with me , you 
know.  And that that was the privileges. 
Q. So he could actually come  to where you were -- 
A.   He had to come , but nobody knows.  He ha
d privileges, too, because he played for the 
commandant, so they respected hi m.  They 
knew that he could get away with it.   
Q. Do you think that your wome n wer e  ma d at you because you had privileges?

the chief of the police.  When 
you don't find these two girls, 
they are going to kill a hundred me n.  So 
the police went out to Krakow, and they found 
these girls, and they brought them back.   
 So these two girls run away, and they br
ought them back.  They found them.  They 
brought them back.  They tried very hard, because they di dn't want that a hundred people

was then happening, so they saw that, too.  
And they saw how he vomited.  He couldn't 
take it, and I think this had a lot to do with hi

that.  He couldn't take this.

it a little bit more for some body who doesn't  
know it.

Q. So, were you, where -- were you 
there until the end of the war? 
A. Yes, I was there until the end of

31 
 
no Germans there.  We  were all on our own, 
and then we heard that the Russians were 
going to come , that the Russians were going to 
come , so they had to 
take Schindler away, 
because people were afraid that the Russians 
ma y not be so ha ppy about him, so they got 
him out of t he camp.  Some drivers from us, so
me  of our prisoners -- we  had a car -- took 
him in the car, took him to the Swiss border.  And the Russians came, the Russian 

soldiers came.  I will never forget them. 
 They came on horse s without saddles, without 
shoes.  Some of them, they had uniforms, some
 of them were dresse
d in plain shirts, and 
they saw what is going on, and then they or
ganized some  offi cers, some  of them spoke 
Yiddish.  There were some  Yiddish officers with
in the Russians, and they let us out of the 
camp, they occupied some  apart ments of the pe
ople there, and they put us in apartments 
of the people there in the town in Berlitzer, out of the camp.  I reme mber I got in an 

apartment where there was a sewing mach

were curtains, and I reme mber that I took down the curtains, and I made some skirts on 

the sewing machine for my sister-in-law and 
for myself.  And I saw some brasierres.  
And I saw some  handkerchiefs for the head.  In
 a few days, I went on the way.  I went on 
the way.  I wanted to go back to Krakau, 
because  I had with my husband an agreement 
that when we live through the war, we were 
going to meet in Krakau.  So me  and my 
sister-in-law, his sister, and 
my brother-in-law and his wife , and we all went on the way 
to -- there were no trains.  I reme mbe r  on the way we stole a horse and a platform, you 

know, like a wagon, and we went to the next town, where there was a little train going.  

We went on this train, and then we went to 
Czekloslovakia.  The Czeks treated us ve ry 
nicely.  They took us to a school, and they fed 
us.  They gave us food.  They let us sleep 
there, and we came to Krakau.  Somehow, it took us ma ybe a week, ma ybe ten days, but 

we ma de it.  So then I was in Krakau, and I 
was together with a girlfriend, and I went to 
this apartment where I used to live when th
e war broke out.  And I 
spoke to the lady, and 
I said, I have no money, but I am a dressmaker
 by profession, so if 
you would let me  have 
a room, I wi ll try to ma ke some  money.  I will pay you, and she did.  She did.  And I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312  
32 
 
living there, and I was living al
ready a little bit hu man life, 
my facilities.  I was living 
with my girlfriend together, and we started to
 sew.  We  got some  woma n, and we sold 
dresses, blouses, shirts, whatever it was, 
and we ma de some  money.  And my husband, he 
didn't come .  And one day my sister-in-law ca
lled me  downstairs, and 
she said, there is a 
newspaper, there came a newspaper fr om Munich.  Regards to the families in Poland 
from the prisoners from Dachau.  And between
 all the name s, there were Henry Rosner 
and his ten-year-old son.  So when I was read
ing that, I said, I am going to go to Munich.  
So my girlfriend says she is going with me . 
 So we ma de ourselves on the way, because, 
ma ybe, I don't know, once we went and then we
 went back, we couldn't go any further.  
Then we went again.  It took me  ma ybe tw
o weeks.  We ll, there was no trains going 
directly or some thing, some  part
s had the trains, some parts didn't have it yet.  We had to 

walk.  We  had to try to get some  communica

French soldiers, wherever we coul
d find them.  So we went there. 
Q. So you found your way to Munich? 

A. I found my way to Munich.  In the last fe
w weeks in Berlitzer, Schindler gave me  back 
Henry's __________.  You know, Henry was taken away the __________ and 

___________ laws, and -- but he said that this is 
not his violin.  This violin belonged to 
Oscar Schindler and Oscar Schindler went 
to ________ Rosen, and said, my violin is 
here.  And he got back the violin.  And in Berl
itzer, he gave me  back the violin.  He said, 
"This is for you, and you ma y use it."  He gave
 it to me .  And then I went to Munich, 
Munchen.  I had the violin.  I took the violi
n.  And I got there -- 
I got there and I found 
them.  My s on was ten years old at this tim
e.  It was in 1945.  He was born in 1935.  He 

was ten years old.  And he looked good, a little 
bit small for his age, but otherwise, he 
looked good.  He was very skinny, and we were
 both sick on Typhus, and he was there in 
Munchen for 11 months.  11 months, the Americans took care of us. 
Q. In ___________?   We re you in ____________?

A. He was working.  He was playing for the 
Americans.  Yes, he was playing -- in the 
Deutchesmu seum, there was a little cafe for 
the American offi cers, and he  was playing 
there with a pianist and th
e orchestra.  Not for mo ney, he got food, you know, canned 
food, cigarettes, sugar, gasoline, whatever. 
Q. How come  you decided to
 go to the United Stat es? 
A. Because he had a brother here.  My husband 
had a brother here.  He came here in 1939 to 
the World's Fair, you know, in the Polish 
_________ as a pianist.  And he couldn't go 
back, because  there was no more communicatio
n.  All the ships were occupied by the 
Ar my, by the soldiers.  He lost his wife and 
his daughter in Poland, a
nd he stayed here.  
So then we knew that he was in America, but, 
of course, they didn't ha
ve an address.  We 
had no way to reach him, so Henry me t in Dachau -- a ma jor from the American army.  

He was an amateur cellist, and his father belonged to the musician's union here.  And 

Henry gave him the na me of his brother. 
 "Henry -- Henry, please go out of the way 
there." 
 Wherewerewe? 

Q. You were talking about finding 
Henry's brother here, I think. 
A. Yes.  So this Dr. Most (ph.), he was a 
dentist by profession.  He was in the American 
army.  He c ontacted his father here, and he
 gave him Henry's  brother's name , and he 

found his address in the musician's union, and th
is is how we contacted his brother, and 
he sent us affadavits, and that's how we came to America. 
Q. You didn't have much problem getting into the country? 

A. No.  No.  We were displaced persons.  
We  were accepted as displaced persons, and we  
had an affadavit from his brother.  We  didn't have no difficulties.

Q. Do you remember your first impressions when you arrived here? 
A. Yes.  My first impression was ver
y, very -- how shall I say -- overwhelming.  
Overwhelmi ng.  You know, the size and everyt
hing was tremendous.  My brother-in-law 
me t us on the pier.  We  came here by boat, you know, and he stopped on the way to a 

Astoria.  He rented us a room in Astoria.
  We  stopped a few time s, becaue he bought ice 
cream for my son.  My son never had ice cream 
before.  It wa s the first time that he had 
ice cream.  So then we have three ________ in
 Astoria for a while, and we started to 
work.  I started to work as an alteration ha
nd in a dress shop.  And Henry started to work 
as a musician.  He got a job in a 
very nice nightclub in New York.   
Q. Okay.  So you were working as a dressmaker -- 

A. No, I was working as an alteration hand, and 
my  husband was working as a violinist.  My 
son went to school.  And then I switched from
 dressmaking to furriers, and I was a furrier 
for 37 years.  And Henry had beautiful jobs.  He
 worked in very fine restaurants and very 
fine hotels, and he -- we pus
hed our son to college.  My son graduated Renselear 
Polytechni c Institute, and we 
ma de a living here, a life here. 
Q. What -- what do you think gave you the 
strength to get th
rough all of this? 
A. Up there.  I think he did a lot of things, 
God did a lot of things.  I think he took away 
from us all these years what we are -- a
nd the years from 1939 until 1945, it's about six 
years.  I think he took it away from us.  
We  always looked younger, and we were mo re 
stronger than people in our ages used to be.  I worked until I was 72 years old.  Henry 

worked until he was 82.  We eliminated these ye
ars.  We  were  very, very lucky.  We  have 
been in Ame r ica, where we only dealt with b
eautiful people.  We ne
ver had any hardship 
here, real hardship we never had.  We  worked hard, but we accomplished what we 

wanted to accomplish.  We are secure in our 
old age, and today we are retired.  We  are 

not rich people, but we live in comfort.   
Q. So your religion gave you strength? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312  
35 
 
A.  Yes, yes, yes.  We  are not religious people.
  We  are Jews, and we are proud to be Jews.  
We are not religious people, no, we are not.  We  don't go to the temple every week.  I 
don't light candles.  I don't keep a Kosher hous
e.  I am not a religious person, but I am a 
Jewess.  I am a Jew. 
Q. Did you ever resent that? 

A. No, I never did.  I never did. 

Q. When you were living in Dachau, and when
 you were living in Auschwitz, did you have 
dreams -- did you think you would get out?   
Did you think that it would be over? 
A. I think I have.  I think I ha
ve.  I think I lived ther e with 
the idea that I am going to live 
through.  I am going to get over this, all of it, 
yes.  But as I was -- the fear was there.  
You constantly fear for your
 life, you know.  I don't re me mbe r  this.  I don't reme mber 
this. 
Q. When you think back now, over all of thes
e years, I am sure th
at there are certain 
thoughts, certain images that you never lost
 that are stronger im
ages than others? 
A. I always tried to live a straight  life.  I tr
ied to be helpful to other people.  I was never 
really a selfish- egoistic person.  I wa s not.  
I tried to do as much as I could, and I did.  I 

did.  A woman in my block, my __________ wo
man -- you know, she respected me for it 
very much. 
Q. Were you one of the few who was that fair? 

A.  Yes.  You can't  talk about yourself, you know, you can't  do that. 

Q. Are there certain images that haunt you 
still, that you have bad dreams about or -- 
A. Yes, yes, yes. 

Q. Likewhat? 

A. Bad dreams that you mi ssed so much -- you 
mi ssed so much of living, because when you 
could live, you couldn't live because you had to work, to work, and to work when there 

was no money.  You know, you didn't relly li
ve.  You were eating and sleeping, and 
doing, but you really couldn't live like other people which were exampled ____________

and his company.  When we came he re, it was already late.  When we came here in 1946, 
I was already 36 years old, and my husband was in
 his forties.  People here in this age, 

they were already settled.  They were estab
lished.  We  were penniless.  I didn't have a 
spoon.  I didn't  have a plate.  I didn't have 
a sheet.  I didn't have nothing.  And I didn't 
have a wedding so I could get wedding gifts 
-- everything -- everything I needed, I had to 
ma ke for it.  I had to work for it, so it was a ve
ry hard life.  A hard 
life, but we were -- we 
were still younger, so we survived. 
Q. Is there anything else that you w
ould like to say about
 your experience? 
A. I don't want to live through it again, that's  fo
r sure.  I had horrible experiences, and I don't 
think -- I don't wish that anybody -- I hope 
never, never, nobody is going to go through 
like this.  I think it's better to die 
before than go through this again. 
Q. Is there anything else that you wa
nt to say about your husband or -- 
A. I am going to say it because --  

Q. You say it, that's  fine. 

A. This is the accordian that I told you that 
this German overseer gave it to my son in 
consideration.  This is the accord
ian.  I kept it all these years.
  Oscar gave it to me back, 
and I hope it's going to be for my grandchildren. 
Q. And this is your fa mous musician -- 

A. This is him, yes. 

Q. I know, I have one more question for you. 

A. Yes. 

Q. After the war, did you ever have 
any contact with Oscar Schindler? 
A. Yes, of course I had.  We got very friendl
y during this ten months that I was living in 
Munchen.  He was living in ________burg, which is
 close, and we got friendly.  That's  
how our friendship started.  And then he emig
rated to South America, Buenos Aires.  
And we have been writing to each ot her letters fr om America, and when my son 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0312  
37 
 
graduated in 1957 from Renselear Polytechni c Institute, he came to Ame r ica to the 
graduation. 
Q. Did you talk to him after the war about hi
s experiences and how he thought about that? 
A. Not too muc h.  Not too much, no.  We didn't wa
nt to talk too much about it, no.  Then he 
came, and I ma de dates with him when he wa
s living in Germany.  Whe n we would go to 

Europe -- we  travelled to Europe, I me t hi m in
 Vienna.  We  spent a few days together.  
Then he started to travel more
 to Israel, and he came again to America once more, and we 
me t hi m.  And when he was here, he was pe
nniless.  He didn't have any money.  So we 

started here a foundation between the survivors 
so we could help him 
out a little bit, you
