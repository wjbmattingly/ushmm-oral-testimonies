Question:
 United
 
States 
Holocaust
 
Memorial
 
Museum interview -- oh boy, what is 
this? 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum, 
Jeff
 and
 Toby Herr
 collection. 
This interview is conducted by 
Reg ina  Ba ier 
on February 9, 2001, in 
Springfield, 
New Jersey. 
This is tape numb er one, side
 A.
 Okay, my  first question is, would you 
tell us your name? 
Answer: My name now is 
Norman Salsitz
, but this is not the or
igin al name. So if you 
ask me from before, I was born as 
Naftali Saleschutz
. And th e 
Saleschutz
 is a very 
long name for 
America
, so we changed it to 
Salsitz. 
But during the war I had a few 
other names, in the way for each -- for each
 time. During the war my name first was 
Tadeusz Jadach, 
a Polish name, then it was 
Tadeusz Za leski
, and then also it was 
Anatoli Sherbakov
, which is a Russian name. Then it was also
 Lazarus Spillman
, it 
was a German name. And when I came to 
America
, we change it to 
Salsitz,
 and I™m 
still 
Salsitz
, and I hope it will be 
Salsitz
 til I die. 
Q: That was very short and nice -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but now I have to as
k you, of course, a little 
[indecipherable]
 
A: So th at later you will edit this. 
Q: Yes, I will edit everything. 
A: Yeah.

Q: And I just want to ask you, say a little b
it more about who were you, or what -- why 
were you 
Tadeusz Za leski
 -- 
A: Okay . 
Q: -- at one point. Who were y
ou, and those different names. 
A: Yeah, now when  I was born 
Naftali Saleschutz
, of course they  had to give me a 
name when I was born. I had a lot of names, not orig -- not names, legally names, 

people called me all kind of names because 
I was not an angel when I was small. My 
family called me different, my friends ca
lled me different. During the war, when I 
escaped from the camp  and I started -- I escape
d to the woods, I had to -- I got false -- 
it™s -- oh, actually, it was not false, it was a 
real birth certificate from a monsignor and 
he gave me the name -- I picked out the name because the -- the name belonged to a 
friend of mine who went with me to scho
ol, and dur -- 1939 he was in the army, he 
was killed. And I picked out his name because he s -- he -- we looked very much alike, 

like we would be brothers. And his name was 
Tadeusz Jadach
. It™s a very good 
Polish name. So I asked the monsig nor, so he 
gave me his birth certificate and I started 

to masquerade when I was in th
e underground in the woods, as 
Tadeusz Jadach. 
Then, during this time, I also
 belonged to a Russian group,
 a Russian partisan groups 
for a short time. So there I got th
e other document in my  name as 
N a ftali
 in 
Russia
, su 
-- supposed to be 
Anatoli
, it™s changed. So I liked 
Ana t oli
, so I got a paper as

Sherbakov
, which is a real Russian name, so I became 
Anatoli Sherbakov
. Then, 
when I d -- was liberated, and I joined th
e Polish army , and th e Po lish army  didn™t 
want me to have the same name as I had in the underground, as 
Tadeusz Jadach
, 
because there was all p o litical 
mis -- they didn™t believe in
 the same ideology, so I 
changed the name to 
Tadeusz Za leski
, it should be similar to my  original name
 
Saleschutz
, so it became 
Za l e s k i
. It could be 
Saleschutz
 but spelled different like in 
Polish, because the real 
Saleschutz
 was spelled like a German
 name. But then people 
were afraid that it -- my superiors, that 
it will have a connection with my name from 
before, so they said let™s have a new name, so 
Tadeusz 
was okay, it™s a good Polish 
name, so I became 
Tadeusz Za leski. 
Then later when I was 
in the -- in the Polish 
army, I was in the intelligence, and I had sp
ecial -- you -- in a special unit, so for a 
certain time I had to be -- to have a German name, because we had to 
interduce
 -- to 
in -- interrogate German officers, but there is
 a long story in my  book about it, so I had 
a friend, his name was 
Lazarus Spillman, 
so I made out documents that I am 
Lazarus 
Spillman. 
And when I came to 
America
 -- so I came -- I got back to my real name, 
Naftali Saleschutz
, but for 
America
 the 
Saleschutz
 was too long. People don™t have 
time to spell, everybody ask how do you sp
ell it. So because I had a brother in 
America
 and his name was
 Salsitz
, so I change it to 
Salsitz. 
And 
Naftali
 they thought 
is a too Jewish name, so I became 
Norm an
, which I™m sorry til 
today because I like

Naftali
 much better than 
No rman
, and this is how I remain. So do -- this is -- this is 
my  n a me. 
Q: This is your many names. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay, I want to skip certa
in things. So-So-Some -- some 
things that we don™t talk 
about will be summarized 
in the middle of narration. But I 
would like you to talk about 
-- about 
Kraków.
 Why did you go to 
Kraków
, when did you go, and what position 
did you have? I want to
 talk about the whole 
Kraków 
scene 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah. Whe -- when I went
 into the Polish army afte
r I was liberated -- I was 
liberated in the beginning of Au gust 1944, and 
I right away wanted 
to go to the army 
because I figured if I survived
 the war, I have to fight th
e Germans, and this was my 
aim, because my father™s last words was, 
Na kuma , na kuma , na kuma . 
It means 
revenge, revenge, revenge, take revenge. I 
figured how can I take revenge? I have to 
be in the army in a special 
unit. And th en I was sent to
 a -- from a -- in --in -- the 
government was in 
Lublin
, the Polish government, temp orary government, because 
Warsaw
 was not liberated, and then later I was sent from 
Lublin 
to  
Szeszo w
, because 
Szeszo w
 was a bigger town
 near my town, 
Kolbuszo wa
, and I know 
Szeszo w -- 
I 
knew 
Szeszow
 and I knew the surrounding and I 
knew the people there. So I was in 
this time -- we call it
 informatsia voickowa
, which means -- this was the political unit

in the army. It was -- so
 a -- when then -- the 12
th
 of January, 1945, was the left -- the 
less 
[indecipherable]
 towards 
Berlin
, towards the -- take over 
Germ any
, because in 
Szeszo w
, when I was liberated, the front stopped, the front stopped in August. And fo r 
six months nothing ha
ppened, they stayed in one 
place, and they made all the 
preparations for the final push. The January th e 12
th
 the war started -- I mean, the 
[indecipherable]
 start ed towards the west, and 
this was actually the last 
[indecipherable]
 til the war was ended. Now I was 
picked out -- in this time they 
picked out a group f-fo -- of 
hundred young, mos
tly officers, and we were assigned to 
go with the Russian front. As 
the Russian front went, we 
went right with them, and 
from the hundred, soon as a town  was liberated, some of us 
remained in the town to 
establish a Polish presence, and to start to
 organize -- organize security, and -- and 
civil offices. So each town had some people le
ft, two or three. I was assigned to do the 
same thing, but til we will re -- reach 
Kraków
. When we reach 
Kraków
 -- so from the 
hundred remained ma ybe 50 or
 60, and we came into 
Kraków, 
and I was assigned to 
the same u n its, which was the 
military -- the milita
ry intelligence, but 
my si -- my par -
- there were a lot of sections. People had 
th e section with the clergy, people had the 
section with the civil organization. I -- my  
section was that I had to do with Germans 
who lived in 
Poland
, or who remained in 
Poland
, or Polish people who collaborated 
with the Germans -- an d they
 ch anged during the occupati
on, they  made out papers 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

that they are ethnic Germans. And because I 
spoke German, so I wa
s attached to this 
unit, and also we had a lot of German prison
ers of war, so I interrogated them, and this 
is how I became the head of the county f -- of 
Kraków
 for this reason, for this 
purposes. 
Q: I will summarize th e story of how you me
t your wife, because it is a long one -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and we have only 15 minutes. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But I would like to talk about afterwards
, so what -- so when -- once you had taken 
care of the columns, that
 was disconnected, the -- 
Kraków
 was saved, what were the 
other jobs? You had a lot of wo rk to  do. Wh
at was basically ho -- what did you work , 
and -- and what was the situation in 
Kraków
, and what did you do? 
A: Well, 
Kraków
 was -- luckily 
Kraków
 was not touched. It was not destroyed y -- 
like other town s. Like 
Warsaw
 for instance, was 90 percent destroyed. 
Kraków
 was 
not destroyed and this is in
 the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because th e 

Germans prepared for a destruction, and 
they prepared 287 co
lu -- places where -- 
were mined, and the 287 I rememb er distinct
ly because this was our main em -- th -- 
main thing to elimin
ate those things. So 
Kraków
 wasn™t destroyed, but our -- our da -- 
duty, wh at we had to  do the first thing, we 
had to clin -- to get rid of the people who 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

collaborated with the Germans. 
Mostly Germans they left, th
e army left, but there were 
some who remained. But the people who co
llaborated, now they 
were Polish people, 
but during th e German occupati
on they made out papers, and 
they find ways that their 
grandfather was from 
Germany
, or great grandfather was a colonist. And e -- 
sometimes even if it was not true. They wanted
 to do it, why? Because doing this they 
became ethnic Germans, and the 
German gave them bigger ra
tion cards, they could get 
a nicer apartment and they could get a good jo
b. Even the Polish people who were sent 
away to concentration camps, a
nd they were -- didn™t have th
e rice, they had more rice, 
and they were the elite during the German oc
cupation. Now, as the Germans left, those 
people tried to be back Poles,
 because actually they were Po
les, they were traitors. So 
naturally our aim was to find 
out, to interrogate them, an d 
to find them. If they came 
from different towns, if they started having
 new papers. So mo stly this was our aim, 
and this was also for the security of the go
vern ment not to have enemies in our place. 
So this was the main things that we had to
 have. Then I got an -- a special job. This 
was -- now we occupied  
Kraków,
 officially occupation was the 19
th
 of January , 1945. 
This was official date. I 
was two days before in 
Kraków
, but this was the official date 
when 
Kraków
 was occupied  do -- by th e Russian army . And -- and the only Polish 
unit was our unit that we came in and that
 we were the -- the first w ho were in 
Kraków
, and th e people looked up to us that we 
are the liberators. In beginning, or i-i-

in th -- in beginning of February , a group came from 
England
, and this was the -- 
organization to study th e crimes of the Ge
rmans. And the head of this group was 
Hewlett Johns -- Johnson
. He was the Dean of 
Canterbury
 from 
England
. He was a 
archbishop and he was the he
ad. And he had in his gro
up mostly professors fro m 
different universities, from 
countries who were not a g -- 
who -- who didn™t work with 
the Germans. Like in 
Europe
 a lot of countries collaborat
ed, and th ey  had armies like 
Hungary
, 
Romania. 
Those were professors from places 
that they were always against 
the Germans, or the Germans were occupying 
their countries. We had professors from 
Russia
, from
 England
, from -- from 
Argentina
, from all over the world. And I was 
assigned that I was to prepare -- I had to 
prep are every day™s activity for this group 
where to go. We went to all concentra
tion camps, to -- like
 for instance, in 
Auschwitz
, 
we were in 
Auschwitz
 maybe two weeks after 
Auschwitz
 was liberated. Everything 
was fresh. The de -- the destruction of the 
crematoriums, they we -- still were h o t from 
-- from -- from fire. The clothing of the people  that they were -- we
re killed, andthey 
were still, the blood was still soft, becaus
e it wasn™t dry up. An
d then th-the -- the 
warehouses from children™s s
hoes, and eyeg lasses, and 
[indeciphera ble]
 and all those 
thing. This was just in th
e beginning. And we found in  
Auschwitz
 also, about 20 to 
thir -- 25,000 people who coul
dn™t be sent out with the 
death marches like they did 
before the Russians occupied. 
So I went with this group for about four, five weeks.

Every day we -- the h
eadquarters were in 
Kraków
 in the hotel, and my job was to 
prepare the itinerary for the next
 day. Where to go, how to go
, to have the cars and the 
transportation for the group. And because I 
spoke a little English, 
so they picked me 
out and I was the one that I explained to th
e man who was in charge of transportation 
from the Dean of 
Canterbury, 
and with him, too, and I br
ought them over to all those 
places. During the times that we went to 
the concentration camps, there was a other 
aim, was the Polish government wanted, is 
to show them how th e people are very 
happy with the communists who came in. 
Now this, everything was staged, nothing 
was the truth. Th -- th -- the -- 
Hewlett Johnson
, the archbish op later had a nickname, 
the Red Dean, because everythi
ng -- he was very much pro-
Russia
. When he went, for 
instance to 
Korea
 in this -- later, and always he went
 to  investigate, but he always was 
pro-
Russia.
 So what my -- my job was 
to -- to stage -- like, fo
r instance, we went to a 
place, to a concentration camp. On the spo 
-- on the way, when we
 saw there a group 
of Po lish peasants, and they were dressed 
in the Polish traditional clothing, which i -- 
this was all staged. So I said
 to him, ﬁWell, let™s find ou
t, let™s stop and find out from 
the people what they think a
bout the new regime.ﬂ Because 
they started to take away 
land from the landowners, and gave them away
 to the peasants. So we stopped, and I 

asked them in Polish, and it was translated. 
Now those were not peasants that we met 
occa -- special we met. Those were people w
ho were told to be on
 this spot, dressed 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001

like peasants and they had all kind of m -- pi
tchforks and other things what peasants 
use. And I said to him, oh there are peasan
ts, it™s good to find out. Now, they were 
prepared, those were people who were from 
the government. Tho -- there were -- who 
belonged to the communist eg 
-- organizations. And they were
 prepared what they will 
be asked, and what they  should a -- was -- 
wa -- should answer. And naturally all of 
them said how happy they ar
e, that before the war they
 were discriminated, the 
peasants. And now they come 
in and th e government is so good fo r the peasants. And 
they took away from th
e very rich  people, who never took 
care on their fields, and they 
divided, they  gave. And she -- they praised -- they praised there the 
[indecipherable]
. 
And this was everything -- natu rally they ma
de the film, and they  made pictures, and 
this was later shown in -- in newsreels, 
how the Polish populatio
n, the peasants are 
very, very  happy with
 it. But this -- ever
ything was staged. 
Q: I want to ask you just one mo re question about 
Kraków
. You also were involved to  
some degree in -- in food and relief efforts, right, because 
[indecipherable]
 people 
were coming back 
A: Yeah, I was -- not officially. Officially 
I couldn™t be ra -- i-involved because the 
first thing, I was not a Jew. 
I -- in this time I was not -- 
Tadeusz Za leski
, a Polish 
Catholic. And th e second th ing, our job was not 
to -- to give food to
 the people, to help 
people. Our job was to find out
 collaborators and other things, but thro ugh my  future

wife, because I started to bring her food 
right the next day when I met her, because 
there -- there was no -- you couldn™t buy food, 
and people didn™t have food. So I use -- 
and we had everything, because in the army
 we had ev erything, so I use -- I took my  
adjutant or some, and I used 
to send to her ev ery day, bread and salami and butter and 
other thin gs. Now, when the people who 
came out from hiding -- you didn™t have yet 
people from concentration camps, because it 
took a few weeks til they started to come 
in. But people came out from hi
ding, they were hungry, and they were -- they were in 
hiding for -- for two years, for y -- year a
nd a half. They  find out that there is a -- 
somebody who surv ived and he is
 Jewish and he has food. So
 th ey started to come to 
her and asked her for -- for -- for food, and 
she was glad to give it to them. Now, as 
she gave them the food, naturally, she notif
ied me. I didn™t see her so often in the 
beginning. She notified me she needs mo re, 
she needs more, and I 
n -- not officially, 
sent her all kind, and she just -- and sh e gave
 it away. Also, I gave her a lot of clothing. 
As we took over a lot of apartments, wh
ere Germans left, or people who were 
collaborators were arrested, we confiscated th
eir apartments, and we had all the things 
from their apartments, so I coul
d give it to her, and she used to distribute to th e people 
who came ba -- with their -- with their conc
entration clothing -- they didn™t -- it was 
winter, because this was in January, February
, it was very cold. So I gave it to her and 
I was very happy and the people find out,
 and wa -- once somebody find out, there 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

12
were more and more and more, 
[indecipherable]
 I gave it her, she gave it -- she give it 
-- give it away, and I was very happy I could 
do it, unofficially. Then later I also find 
out that there was a woman, and there is a film made ab out it. They called it, ﬁ
My 
Hundred Children.ﬂ
 And this woman collected child
ren who were left for -- fo -- 
after fa -- they were hidden, and also a lo
t of Polish people who to
ok in the children to 
hide, and they were promised money after the 
war, and then later they find out that the 
parents are killed, nobody came back, so  they abandoned th
e children. And the 
children didn™t have wh ere to 
go. So the Jewish co -- commi
ttee started to collect those 
children, there was one woman special, and 
she is in -- in the 
book th -- what they 
wrote, 
ﬁMy Hundred Children.ﬂ 
She collected chil -- she lost
 all her family, so she 
collected those children and br
ought them into the Jewish 
committee, and they were on 
-- they had that 
[indecipherable]
, but she didn™t had wa -- 
what -- how to feed them. 
So she find out about me, because when I came to 
Kraków
, and I went right away to 
two leaders of 
Kraków, 
one was -- his name  was -- he wa
s involved with
 the Jewish 
committee, he was a lawyer be
fore the war, his name was 
Stulbackt
. And th en it was 
a rabbi who survived the war, not from 
Kraków
, but he kra -- remained, and he was in 
Kraków
, and he was like the official rabbi. His name was 
Steinberg.
 So I came to 
them and I told them, ﬁListen, I am a Jew.
 N o body knows that I am a Jew, b u t I want 
you should know. Any time you have a proble
m, and I am in the government, and I

have a big position. If you need something, please te
ll me, not official, and I will do 
what I can do.ﬂ In this what 
I -- they always came to me  and the brought me problems, 
and -- and I have -- and now -- in -- in
 my  new books that I writing now, 
ﬁTreasure of 
Jewish Memories,ﬂ 
I™m describing those episodes fr -- from the -- what a -- for -- 
from this time. So when
 -- when I find out that the child
ren are there, they didn™t have 
what to wear, they didn™t ha
ve what to eat, so  I sco -- I-I
 couldn™t give them money, 
and I -- so we had a lot of sugar. And becaus
e sugar the Germans th -- had the sugar in 
warehouses and we took it over. So I told this
 woman, I cannot give you money, but if 
you have a truck -- I cannot deliver it -- you ca
n come and pick out 
and I can give you 
as mu ch sugar as you want, and later you sell 
the sugar. So this way they could support 
themselves. Then later th
ey need ed  some clothing
. And we took away from 
Germany
 
two large warehouses, because
 the Germans had warehouses for underwear, shirts and 
other things, for the Germans,
 because everything was on ration cards. Now the Poles 
didn™t get anything, but the Germans got 
-- oh, and those were I find out where the 
warehouses are, because when the germ -- be
fore the Germans left
, they put all this 
material in two houses in basements. Th
ey were big basements because this was a 
whole 
[indecipherable]
 and I find out about it. So we went and we confiscated 
everything. So I had a lot of this material. 
I remember there were children™s socks, and 
children™s underwear, and ev erything what -- 
so -- so I brought -- every time I came 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

over to th em, so I brought a trunk full of thos
e things and I gave it to them. Now, they 
knew that I am Jewish, those few people, bu
t the rest, they didn™t know. And when I 
took it out from the warehouses, the people 
who work with me, th
ey didn™t know why 
I take it aw ay. Maybe they thought maybe 
I take it and I sell it on black market or 
something. But I gave it away
 all to my girlfriend, or 
to the Jewish committee.  
Q: When  you th ink about the time today, 
you were very busy -- about that time in 
Kraków
 -- you were very busy, you had a lot of
 work. Was that spec
ial for you, that 
time of fo -- and if so, for what reason? 
A: I think this was the best time of my -- th
ere were two times that there were the best 
times of my life. And I think this was the 
best time. One time was 
the best time when I 
-- like for instance, when I was 
in the woods, naturally we 
starved, it was cold, and it 
was terrible fear. But if we could do something -- there was one time that we made a 

raid of -- o-on -- we made a raid, there was a -- a sop -- police statio n from 
Puskov,
 
from the 
SS
, and we made the raid, and we killed th
em, all of them, so I think this was 
the happiest day in my life. As a matter of 
fact in my  book th ere, somebody wrote, and 
in th -- in -- and what I explained to him it 
is -- it was like when I had the machine gun 
in my hand, it™s like a lame 
who couldn™t walk, and suddenly 
he -- he -- he was able to 
walk. To me, that I was not any more the vic
tim, that I w asn™t any more the pe -- the 
person who was killed, that I could pay back
. And this was my life why I wanted to 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
15
live. To take revenge, which I 
did as much as possible. In 
Kraków
, it was a other, 
naturally we couldn™t go out, we couldn™t 
kill people any mo re, it was after the war. 
But for me to see that the people, the Jewi
sh came ba -- the Jews came back, they had 
nothing, they di -- and even the Po lish gove
rnment was not very, very friendly with 
them, because individual -- maybe the gove
rnment as a whole was not anti-Semitic, 
because in this time it was a communist g
overnment, but each individual policeman, 
each individual clerk, ev
erything, he had this hate in hi
s heart as again the same thing, 
they didn™t change. Now, if I could do so
mething, I was very happy. People that I 
didn™t know, they find out -- th
ey find out that -- that they
 could do -- through me they 
went to this rabbi, and if I could help them
 I was very happy. And also, also, if they 
needed apartments, an d ther
e was every apartment, usually there was a -- a office 
where they gave out the apar
tments. Now, if a Jew came fo
r an apartment and even he 
lived before in 
Kraków
, they wouldn™t give it to hi
m because the people were very, 
very against Jews. And they said, ﬁWell, 
why did you come back?ﬂ And they  looked at 
that Jew -- and now I™m writi
ng a new book about the killings
 after the war, so the title 
of the book is what they used to  say in the title is, you are still alive? I -- and the 

subtitle is, I thought they killed all of you. 
This was the first ques
tion -- the first that a 
Pole ask a Jew when he surv
ived. But when -- wh
en -- when they went to this rabbi 
and the rabbi knew that he could be helped
 through me, I did it. 
Now this was a very,

very rewarding thing for me. Because if I st
arted a thing, we were killed, and nobody 
did anything. And th is time we were undre
ss -- I™m not talking I personally, but the 
Jews, and we were undr -- dress over a -- a 
-- a ditch, and we were killed. Now if e-
each one of them would 
think, if I would live and if I 
could pay them back, everybody 
will do it. Now, after the wa
r, people didn™t do it. The wa
r is ended, and everybody 
was interested to have a bread, to make a liv
ing, and to  save his family if he had a 
family. But for me, I surv
ived for two reasons -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
A: -- for me, I survived for two reasons. And 
this, to -- to survive,
 you had to have a 
legacy, you had to have a reason. Th-This 
gave you strength, ot
herwise you couldn™t 
survive. And I had two. One wa
s when my father was killed, he yelled to take revenge, 
and I -- it is now 55 - 60 years later, I still he
a r his si -- hi s screa ms.  This was one that 

gave me strength. I have to live, because 
I was the youngest, and I was the only one to 
pay back, pay back fo r my  five sisters, pa
y back for my  -- the sister™s husbands, pay 
back for my  nieces and nephews
. Who would pay back? So th
is mean that they were 
killed, and nothing will
 happen to the people 
who did it. So this was one legacy that it 
gave me strength. To take back the sec
ond one was when my  mo ther was taken away 
to 
Belzec
 w ith my five sisters to be killed in 
Bel zec, 
she somehow gave to somebry --

body a letter, and I got the lette
r from this person. I was in 
[indecipherable]
 and sh e 
wrote to me, you are my  ninth child, you 
are the youngest. You are young, you are 
strong, you are smart. If somebody will su
rviv e, you will survive. Because she 
believes that somebody will survive. She sa id, ﬁAfter the war, go to your brother,ﬂ 
because I had a brother in 
Palestine
, ﬁgo to y -- 
Palestine, 
go to your brother,ﬂ I had a 
brother in 
America
, ﬁand tell the whole wo rld wh at the German mu rderers did to us.ﬂ 
So this is the reasons that after the war, I 
started to tell, even in the beginning people 
didn™t want to listen. But I spoke, and th
ey  thought I have an obsession, some people 

didn™t like it. Later, 20 years later, st -- peopl
e started to realize, and they listened. 
Books came out, movies came out. But I star
ted to speak the first minute I left 
Poland
, 
and I told  the stories. And pe
ople thought that it is someth
ing wrong with me. And this 
gave me strength to survive. That if we 
will not be alive, the 
whole world 
would know 
what a cruel thing happened in
 this time. And for this re
ason not only I, all survivors, 
their duty is to write down, and to write and 
tell the stories. Because everyone surviv ed 
a different way. Everyone had 
different problems and cruelties. So for this I am telling, 
and I am going out, if somebody asked me 
to go and speak, I don™t care where and 
how and when, I never took money f-for it, and 
I am doing it because I think this is my 
duty, that the people should
 know what 
happened .

Q: Before we get to 
America
, you had to leave 
Czechoslovakia
, or afer -- n-n -- I™m 
sorry, 
Poland, Poland
 first. Te-Te-Tell us a little b
it more about some time the 
decision was made, or you -- y
ou and your wife talked abou
t would you stay or would 
you leave. S-Say so mething ab out it. 
A: Well, then later from 
Kraków
, I was tran sferred to 
Breslau
, and I became the head 
of the security for 
Breslau
 for the cow -- fo r the town. In 
Kraków 
wa -- I was the 
head for the 
county. In 
Breslau
 I was for the town. And ag
ain the same story, in 
Breslau
 I had a lot of work , because
 Breslau
, first thing 
Breslau
 was 90 percent or 85 
percent destroyed, and there were a lot of
 Germans, and we wanted  the Polish people 
should come in, and they shou
ld show that there is -- th
is became a Polish town, and a 
-- and we then -- later we gave out in orders
 that all the Germans have to leave. Now 
they left, and they had two suitcases, a
nd this was something fo r me very, very  
important, because this was a pay back what
 they did to the Je
ws. Naturally they -- 
when they were sent out, when
 we brought them to the trai
n, we didn™t kill them th -- 
like in the -- in the 
Szeszo w 
where I was and one day they 
killed 6,000 Jews, sik -- 600 
Jews, then thousand Jews, by an 
aktia -- 
we call it a
 aktia
, it means an 
[indecipherable]. 
But by the Germans nobody was killed,
 they only had to leave. Now 
the -- their apartments were 
taken over by Polish people, a
nd in -- in -- in -- but -- but 
one thing we s -- in this tim
e also, the -- it started in 
Israel
, we knew -- 
Palestine 
in 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

this time, and we knew 
Palestine
 will have to -- the Jews will try to have their own 
country. And as -- I always was a Zionist. 
I never became a me mb er of the communist 
party, even  they ask me to do 
it. But my excuse was that I 
am not in th -- I -- I am not 
taught enough to know the ide -- the ideo
lo gy about communism, I have to learn a 
little more, I have to read more
 and this was my excuse. And my wife never wanted to 
stay, because my wife had ve
ry bad experience, because wh
en the Russians came in to 
the -- her town in 
Stanislav -- 
in
 Stanislavov
 in 1940 -- in 1939, 
and they lived under 
co-communist regime, now the people who were well off were middle class 
[indecipherable]
 middle class th ey were -- th-th-th
e Russians tried to liquidate them. 
If they were Zionists they sent them to 
Siberia
, if they were rich
 they took away 
everything. So from them th
ey took away their apartm
ent, they took away the 
busin ess. Her father had to be a plain wo
rker, which -- my wife wanted to study 
medicine, they didn™t let her in because sh
e was a daughter of a bourge -- bourgeois 
family. So she sa -- an d then 
they saw the system i s not fo
r her, so she didn™t want to 
stay in 
Poland
. And sh e always said, well in 
Poland
 you got a king for a night, but the 
end we -- I don™t want. So we started 
to think -- and I al
so, when I was in 
Breslau
, I 
start -- well, even in 
Kraków
, I started to work in that organization, a Zionist 
organization. Naturally the people from the 
organization knew th at I am Jewish, and I 
gave them some protection, and they 
had to -- to -- to travel toward the

Czechoslovakian
 border, I helped them. 
And also, when  I was in 
Breslau
, I was still 
involved with this organization, and -- and 
-- and -- but -- but the end was that we had 
to leave, til it came a time that
 my  wife said she ha -- we have to leave because the 
longer we will wait, it will be 
harder to -- to go away. Now, I left first, and I left very -
- not organize in 
[indecipherable]
 because I went with that 
-- with a truck, through the 
border to 
East Germany, 
and on the way I could be cau
ght, I we -- but it™s a long 
story, but I left.  

Q: I want to ask you a follow up question th
ough. Were there other thoughts of why 
you wanted to leave? 
A: Yo -- well, my th -- my th
ought -- well, see, the first thin
g my wife wanted to leave, 
of course, she had family in pales -- in is -- in 
Palestine
 at this time. She had a 
grandmother, she had a sister, she has three 
uncles with her family. So she said, well 
she had somebody. And I wanted to leave be
cause I saw , even now -- I have a good 
position and everything, but I had to masque
rade. I wanted to be myself. I -- why 
should I -- if we have a free country , and if we -- the communist regime is so equal, no 

anti-Semitic, why do I have to hide
 my identity? Why do I have to be 
Tadeusz 
Za l e s k i
? Why can™t I be my self? And also, be
ing a non-Jew, the people wh o work  
with me, the people who were in the govern
ment didn™t have no secrets because I was 
one of them. So then I coul
d see that deep in -- imbedde
d anti-Semitism towards Jews. 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
21
And nobody was a friend sp  -- in those -- in th
is time. E v en offici
ally they couldn™t go 
out and say, well I hate Jews, and this and 
that, but inside ever
ybody was anti-Semite. 
Now, in the -- there were no secrets from me, 
so I saw that this 
will not be a life for 
me, and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see, in 
Russia
, in the Russian 
system there were three kinds of people. Peop
le who were in jail, people -- pe -- he -- 
people who were in jail, people who are in 
jail, and people who will be in jail. So the 
end was I -- I didn™t care how
 big I was, the end was if
 I do so mething -- something 
wrong, see, if I would be a -- a 
[in d ecipherable]
 if I would be a -- a communist, and I 
will like the regime, and I 
[indecipherable]
, so then I would say, well this is my life, 
and I love it. I wasn™t -- I come from a 
very Orthodox, ultra-Or
thodox home. Reet -- 
not, I wouldn™t say millionaires
, but a very comfortable home. We were -- we were 
considered  10 percent of the richest peopl
e in our town. And the whole family was 
very religious, so I was not brought up to be
 against religion, or to  hate people who 
have money or make a living. I did it because
 it was comfortable for me in this time. 
The war ended, I wanted to take revenge, 
and I could have a job 
to be acknowledged, 
but not as a Jew, so this was very bad for 
me. So I knew that th e end would be I will 
not be there. But longer my w -- my wife 
was very smart, she 
said, longer wewill 
wait, worse it be to come out. And naturally 
I went out first, and she remained and she 

was arrested because they 
thought through her they w
ill get me. So -- but I never, 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
22
never had my mind, because th
is was not a regime for me. Now, we want to go to 
Palestine. 
I was registered, and I work
ed with that group called 
Bricha
. 
Bricha
 was 
the one who took out people, an
d they smuggled them to 
Italy
 and from
 Italy 
to 
Palestine.
 Now, from 
Poland
 the 
Bricha
 went over to 
Germany
, from 
Germany
 to 
Italy. 
Now, unofficially I belonged to th
em, because my  dream was to be in 
Palestine. 
Because even when I was home befo
re the war I wanted to go to 
Palestine
. But then 
later we escaped and we came to 
Germany
. In 
Germany
 there was other -- other 
problem to go to  
Palestine
 because you couldn™t go offi
cially, you had to go illegally, 
and you wind out in 
Cy prus 
in a camp  and my  wife didn™t wa
nt to go to a camp, so we 
came to 
America
. We said, we will go to 
America
 -- which one would come first, 
Palestine
 or 
America
, and if 
America
 comes first, we™ll go to 
America
, and if we™re 
in 
America
 we can always go to 
Palestine. 
And we came to 
America
, and the first 
money we made in 19
49, so we went to 
Palestine -- 
to -- it was already 
Israel
, not 
Palestine
. Well, this 
[indecipherable]
 but -- but it was -- for me it was too late, 
because there was no war -- 
Q: We -- we™ll get there, I want 
-- I just want to -- to -- to -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- follow the chronology a little bit. 
A: Yeah.

Q: Was it difficult to get a visa? Wa -- did y
ou need papers that 
you didn™t have? What 
was -- 
A: From where? From 
Poland? 
From po -- 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 no, no, no, no, from 
Germany. 
A: Oh, from 
Poland
 you couldn™t go no place -- 
Q: No, no, I know, but -- 

A: I had to ask [
indecipherable
] yeah, it was difficult because in 
Germany
 if -- see, I 
had a large family in 
America
. My  father had four brothers and two sisters and they 
had children. Naturally, they were 
[indecipherable]
. And we always -- and I had a 
brother. So I wrote to them that I need a
ffidavit, you need  affidavit there, oh, my  
brother said he™d  send me, I never got it. So
 I never got -- so I got -- and we wanted to 
go at -- if we couldn™t go to -- to 
Israel
, we want to go to 
America
, we didn™t want to 
stay in 
Germany
, because for me being in 
Germany
, every day it was the biggest 
torture. Because when  I went in in a trolle
y car, and if I saw every German, I looked at 
every German, I saw in every Ge
rman I saw that he was the 
murderer of my father, the 
murderer of my family. Ever
y German looked to me the 
same. And I couldn™t stay, so 
-- and I had a lot of problems, because I re
me mb er once I went in and in  the trolley 
car, and -- and I was sitting on -- on a seat, and there a woman, a elderly woman came 

in, and -- and I didn™t get up, and so one 
young German came in, he says, why don™t 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
24
you get up, she™s a old woma
n, and -- and -- and you are 
young fellow, why don™t you 
-- so I said well, did some
body get up when  my  mo ther came in? My mo ther was 
killed. So why should I -- maybe those are 
the people who killed my -- so we had a 
argument, then later we had the fight. I re
member once we came in in a place and I 
saw a la -- young Jewish, they fighting with
 a group of young Ge
rmans. I didn™t ask 
questions, I di -- I didn™t know why. I jump
ed in. But so happen
s that I didn™t look 
Jewish, so the Jewish people starte d to beat
 me up. I said, ﬁWhat are you beating me 
up?ﬂ They said, ﬁWell, 
aren™t you a German?ﬂ I said, ﬁN o, I am Jew ish.ﬂ So every day 
-- every day something else. So we di -- we wanted to  get out, and we came -- you 
couldn™t go, you need ed that affidavit. So 
I -- my family didn™t 
send it to me, so the 
Joint Distribution, they  gave out -- what th
ey  did, they didn™t 
give out individual 
affidavits, they made a group, let™s say 
hundred people and one affidavit, and the 
organization took care to show the government that we will not later stay in the -- in -- 

in -- and not to make a living.
 So this is how we came. Ev
en they paid 
-- they -- the 
Joint paid for my transportatio
n, for the passage. Then later 
I paid them back, but they 
didn™t know if I would pay them b
ack. But my family
 didn™t do it. 
Q: So when you got the visa finally, wh at
 -- what happened th
en ? Where did you go, 
and how was the boat trip? 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
25
A: When I got that visa, so 
we were assigned to go to 
Bremen
, and from 
Bremen
 to 
go to 
America
. But in this time, w e -- we had to stay in 
Bremen
 almost a half a year, 
because it was a coal strike in amer -- in -- in  
America
, and the sh ips -- the boats 
didn™t take us. 
Q: Was it 
Bremen
 or 
Bremenhaven? 
A: 
Bremenhaven.
 In 
Bremenhaven 
we were there in there 
they made like a staging 
area in a school, and the people you were stay
ing there, they gave us to eat, but we 
couldn™t leave. Now, it was also a very unp
leasant place because that ger -- when -- 
when  you got -- when  you had to go to  get 
the visa, Germans got the visa very fast. 
But course, by us, there was in this time, the 
consul and the co -- th
ey -- they -- they 
didn™t let the Jewish people who wanted to go to
 America
, they didn™t let them to -- to 
see the consul. Why? Because they dema
nded documents, birth certificate, and 
[indecipherable]
. Where did the Jews get documents when they  came out from death 
camps? So every day in the consulate, th
ere were hundreds of Jews waiting that 
nobody could reach the cons
ul. So there was one secret
ary and she made a business 
out of it, and for 200 dollars, she made that
 you could see the consul. Now people start 
-- who had money started to pay her, and ev
erybody knew that she takes money. No w 
the first thing we didn™t have the money a
nd we didn™t want to 
pay, why should  we 
pay her? So because my wife spoke English, 
I spoke a little English,
 I said, we have to 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
26
take it in our hand. So there was that 
general consul, I rememb er his name was
 
Clarke
. And this 
Clarke
, we said  we have to see him. S o  once when he went for 
lunch, we stopped him. And my  wife said 
she wants to talk to him, and sh e -- he 
explained -- she explained to him that it is
 impossible, there are hundreds of people 
who want to go to 
America
, and we cannot go because 
this woman demands 200 
dollars for a person to let her see -- and sh
e -- she was a partner with one of the vice-
consuls, there was 
[indecipherable] 
and she was a partner and she sent it to him and 
they got im -- they got the visa. So
 she told this -- everything to the 
Clarke
 and I was 
standing there and he listened and listened. 
So he said, well I want you should come to 
my  office, and we went there. And we explai
ned, and I reme mb er th
at when we left, so 
he came to us and he put the hand on our he
ad. He said, ﬁWell, do you know, children 
like you we need in 
America .ﬂ
 And he changed the whole 
rule. Instead before you 
needed  -- she -- this woman said, ﬁIf you do
n™t have the documents, I don™t let -- I 
don™t make the application.ﬂ So  he changed 
the rules, and the rules were you needed 
two witnesses. And when the 
two witnesses gave a state men
t that they know you, you 
come from this town, and ev erything, the 
two witness was -- so
 everybody got two 
witnesses. One was a witness 
for him, then later he was 
a witness for them. And then 
the people -- we were -- we ca -- we came th
em every day. Then later the people knew 
that we made this change, and they were 
very happy. Even til t
oday some people who 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
27
are here and they always remind us that we 
went and we had the gu
ts to speak up. And 
this way, we -- this woman was fired. They
 -- the -- the consul -- the visa consul was 
still there. It so happened th
at we were assigned -- I remember he had one le -- he was 
a -- a invalid, so we were assigned to him b
ecause the general consul didn™t take care 
on all the children, so -- on all the people, so
 we were assigned to him. When we were 
assigned to him, and -- and he
 didn™t ask us too many ques
tion because we had the two 
affidavits. Then later he said to raise th
e hand and he sw ore us in. So I was afraid 
because I almost burst out in laughter, beca
use he was the one who was a partner with 
this woman, and now he is giving me this th
ing. Well, we got the 
visa and we had to 
go to 
Bremen, 
in 
Bremen 
we got stuck for six months. An
d then later we went on the 
-- on the liberty ship. Those were the ships, th-the name was
 Ernie Pyle
. This was the 
last time th at the liberty sh
ip, and unlucky we were cause 
it was in the winter, it was in 
January, and -- and underw -- underway it was 
a terrible storm, a
nd the ship, the boiler, 
everything broke and we almo st drowned. 
And everybody was so sick, that I was 
laying on the -- on -- on th e 
[indecipherable]
 the -- the people, the men were in the 
basement, what maybe 201 in -- in -- in th
is hole. No w th e wo men were 20 - 25 in 
their cabin, when -- and I was so sick I wa
s laying out -- outside on th e deck. And I 
pray to God it™s -- the ship should sink. I coul
dn™t take it, I didn™t eat. So my wife, in 
this time she put on a woman™s housecoat w
ith the woman™s pajama and the kerchief 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

28
on my  head, and she took me in in her room
. And the people in her room knew and -- 
that I am w ith her and I slept there, and 
this was a little b etter. But what -- we were 
very, very  angry that the German people wh o went to 
America
 in this time, cause a lot 
of German went to 
America
, they had family here, they
 had the big, best cabins, 
because they had money topay. And they -- the peopl
e from the company were 
German, so they had cabins and they were
 sitting and eating and 
drinking and dancing. 
And we were laying like -- like dogs in -- in -- so this was very, very unfair. But this 
how they  came. So mo -- not only on our ship
, on all the ships. So
 the German people 
had all the privileges because they were nor
mal people and they got
 people who gave 
them those places, and they could pay for 
it. So then we came 
to -- w e came to 
[indecipherable]
 we arrived in 
America  
January the 17
th
, and -- and -- and we were 
so sick. So then later, a ni
ght before, somebody said, tomo
rrow morning we arrive in 
America
. So I -- I as -- how -- as sick we were
, everybody di -- dragged out the -- the -
- the -- the best suit, with the best coat, and we were 
[indecipherable]
 and we waited 
half a night, we were just staying on th e de
ck waiting for the Statue of Liberty. And 
when  the statue of -- when we saw the Statue
 of Liberty, everybody from us started to 
cry. Even  today 
[indecipherable]
 we saw already the Statue of Liberty, and this we -- 
we are in 
America
. Now wa -- wa -- wa -- this was not the end. Then later when we -- 
we went that -- they said to take out the va
lises and everything, so we took it out on th e

29
deck. Everyone to his initial, 
N 
to 
N, S
 to 
S 
and so  on, and then later they came to 
check. So the American customs, 
th ey  op en ed  th
e valises, they 
[indecipherable]
. And 
we were staying there in -- where -- where the [
indecipherable
]
 
then a 
[indecipherable]
 a heavy set guy in the -- in the -- 
in the lumber jacket comes in and 
he goes around and he ask 
where is it, where are the 
Saleschutz™s? 
Sa -- so we were 
very much afraid, maybe -- figured maybe some
thing is wrong, an d they would ship us 
back or something. We didn™t say anything 
in the beginning and later he said, ﬁWell, 
their should -- was supposed to
 be two people with the name 
Saleschutz
,ﬂ yeah. So 
my wife was standing there, and sh e said, ﬁYes, we are 
Saleschutz
.ﬂ And ﬁWhat™s 
wrong, what™s wrong?ﬂ We were so afraid
. So he said, ﬁNothing is wrong.ﬂ An d he 
got up to  my  wife and he kissed her, he got
 up to me, he said, ﬁYou know, I am,ﬂ --

the sidewalk when we took us
 out, a car was waiting and we went in in the car and th is 
was -- my  brother was waiting in the car, they

 were sick in the 
[indecipherable]
 that was t errible sick,  so she 
somehow -- she didn™t have -- I -- I couldn™t  eat anything, and -- and so she em -- met 

a r -- a sailor and he was a black sailor, so sh
e told him I am sick, so he used to give 
her an -- an apple, a banana, something lik

Q: So now you are an American
 and one of the first, most
 pressing things was to find 
work  for you. Tell a little -- te
ll a little bit about the work 
process. Did you have help 
from your family, how -- what happened? 
A: Well, the wer -- the work process, first in 
America
, I had the very unpleasant thing 
-- see, my  brother took me to his home, a
nd I stayed with my  bro -- he had his own 
house, and I stayed with his house two week s.
 After two weeks he said that I have to 
look for an apartm
ent, because in 
America
 tw o weeks is enough, and th en later you 
[indecipherable]
 the fami -- and so -- so I bro
ught with me 200 dollars. 200 dollars I 
brought, they were hundred dollar bill, two hu
ndred dollar bills, but 
they were the long 
hundred dollar bills, maybe you remember th ey
 were the long one,
 not the new one in 
there and so  my  brother said we™ll go to th e bank, we™ll put it in the bank. And we 
went with  him to the bank, to his bank. A
nd th e girl wh o took it looked and lo oked, 
and she called the manager, and the manage
r looked  at it and he said those are 
counterfeit money. He said, we
ll by right I have to call the 
FBI
, and see, because if 
you just came over, maybe you smu -- maybe with
 the ring, but he™s going to do us a 
favor. He did us a favor and he took a match 
and he burned the 200 dollars. He said, ﬁI 
will not call nobody,ﬂ and later of -- well, today, I am very sorry that he did it, because 
I™m a -- a -- a coin collector and a bank 
note collector, so today those -- this money 
was made in 
Auschwitz
,  they had Jewish engravers a
nd artists, and they made false 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

32
money. And 
Germany
 used th is money all over the wo rld. So today, a hundred dollar 
bill which was counterfeit and was in 
Auschwitz
 is worth 10,000 dollars. But they 
burned it and th is was my  -- so then I had 
to look for a job. Now before -- before 
looking for a job, so the fami
ly got together. I had uncles 
and I had cousin s, and some 
cousins were very rich. So we
 got together and they said, what should we do with  the 
boy. It means me. I was in this time 27 years.
 My wife and -- got a first job she got in -
- to make ties. But she didn™t
 know how to  sew, so she work ed th ere one week  and the 
woman said, ﬁYou know, you didn™t make en
ough, ev en half wh at I™m going to pay 
you, and I -- you can -- you can leave.ﬂ But she went and she got a permit to be a 
Hebrew teacher, yeah, so in the beginning 
she got the permi -- a temporary permit and 
later 
[indecipherable]
 she got a -- so I lived on her -- 
on her salary. But I -- we found 
an apartment, it was very hard
 to find an apartment, so It
alian man took us in in his 
apartment, he had two rooms. And he -- we 
were in one room, and he didn™t want to 
take money for being 
[indecipherable]
 so he said you stay here, and we were there, 
and it was a very bad in a -- over a factory 
and then -- and we had a lot of mice. We 
had a small kitchen and he ha
d his bedroom. We had in  the living room we slept in. 
Then later he left for 
Italy
, and I remember h is name was 
Rosario
. He left for 
Italy
, 
and then  he said -- he gave us over the apar
tment, it was very hard
 to find apartment. 
Now I had to get a job. So I didn™t have a 
trade, and my  English wasn™t good, so a

cousin got me a job in the same h ouse in 
a ink factory. And the ink factory was very, 
very bad for me, because there were 11 peop
le. There were 10 blacks, I was one white, 
which is all right. But the boss, the owner, to
 the -- when  the black boys came in he 
used to tell them good morn
ing. When  I came in, I said good mo rn ing, he never 
answered.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
A: -- now I had to get a job. 
So  I didn™t have a trade, and 
my English wasn™t good, so a 
cousin got me a job in the same h ouse in 
a ink factory. And the ink factory was very, 
very bad for me, because there were 11 peop
le. There were 10 blacks, I was one white, 
which is all right. But the boss, the owner, to
 the -- when  the black boys came in he 
used to tell them good morn
ing. When  I came in, I said good mo rn ing, he never 
answered. And then -- a
nd then he disliked me from th e 
first minute. And I knew that I 
will not be able to be there 
long. So I had the friend -- and 
I almost got crazy, I wanted 
to commit suicide, because here -- from 
Poland
 I was a big shot and I came over here 
and I was nothing. I -- I couldn™t make a livi
ng. I made a -- the first job, I remember I 
made 21 dollars a week. And 21 
dollars a week, my wife, as
 a teacher, she made more 
than double. So what -- and a
bout 21 dollars. So I knew th at
 I will not stay there long. 
So I went to my friend, he was a psyc
hiatrist and he came with me on one 
ship
. He 
was the head of 
Graystone
 Park
, 
that is a mental hospital. 
And I told him that I -- I™m 
going crazy, I will commit suicide.
 So he said, ﬁYou have 
to quit the job because you 
cannot,ﬂ -- what my job was, I f -- in a ink factory I filled out every -- there were three 
trays with ink. I had the gadget and I put in
 and I fill up the ink, all day staying there. 
So I was thinking and I will li 
-- I -- I lived thro
ugh the whole war 
during every day. 
So he said, ﬁYou have to qu
it, you have to go to have a 
job, you sh ould wo rk with  your 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

35
mind. Not like this.ﬂ So -- so he
 -- so -- in -- in -- in -- to 
quit, I figured before I quit I 
have to take care of my boss, who made my  life miserable
.
 So I took care of him -- 
well, not -- then -- do you want me take -- how I take care? 
Q: You could just -- 
A: All right, so I worked on th
is -- in the factory and -- and this man, he made my -- he 
gave me -- he start to call me a very bad name. He was Jewish and he was from 

Poland
, but he was already here 25 years, yes,
 so he was a big shot. So -- and -- so I 
was -- like for instance, I don™t kn
ow if I told you this the last time, we also ma de -- by 
ink, we also made mu cilage
, 
the glue. We were -- you know wh at mu cilage is -- is, 
yeah? So we made this, and wh
en we made it we had to  put in a big container, powd er 
with water and this had to boil. But while 
it was boiling you had to mix it, or otherwise 
it would burn. So I used to mix it, so he co
mes in and he™s -- calls me bad names, he 
said not to mix it from the left to the ri
ght, but from the right to the left. I says, 

ﬁWhat™s the difference?ﬂ He said, ﬁBecause I 
want it so.ﬂ So I said -- and he showed 
me how. So  we made one batch his way, an
d it took 15 minutes longer than my  way. 
So I said, ﬁYou see, mine goes faster.ﬂ He
 said, ﬁStill I want my way.ﬂ And he -- he 
abu -- he -- he abused me, so I said so
meday I will teach  you a lesson. And -- and 
when  -- when -- we had this cage, it was about
 like a room with the ink that we put in 
in the bottles the ink, and wh
en it was empty, so we wash ed it out, so when it was 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
36
empty, so I took a -- a stopper, a cork from th
e mu cilage and I put it 
into the spigot in 
the inside, and then later we filled it up w
ith water, and we -- w
ith powder, and with 
the mechanical mixerer. And then when I star
ted to put in wa -- it didn™t go. It didn™t 
go. He couldn™t unders
tand why, so he went up on the ladder, and th is was like a -- 
like a -- lik e -- like a ha -- like a room. He trie
d with a wire to push through. Mo re he 
pushed, worse it was, and th en later he couldn
™t reach it, he put -- put -- he took a box, 
put in th e ladder on the box and th-then try.
 I don™t know wh at happened , this was a 
full -- it was maybe thousands of
 gallons of ink, and someth
ing happens that he bent 
over and he fell in there. He almo st drowned 
and he started to yell,
 they pulled him up. 
As they pulled him out and -- and -- and -- and 
bi -- he was still dripping with th e ink, 
and he gave me a name -- there is a 
expression, and -- for a refugee or a 
[indecipherable]
, they called him a greener -- a greener 
[indecipherable]
 but he gave 
me two names. He g-gave me a greener 
tookas
, it means a green ass, that™s how -- and 
this how he called me. 
And I was very angry 
[indecipherable] 
so when -- the minute 
we pulled him out, so tha -- the first thi
ng he said, ﬁNobody did it but the greener 
tookas
.ﬂ So -- so then -- and then he didn™t kn
ow how he fell in, but he was on the lad 
-- on the ladder, I -- so happens that I went 
through and -- and I did it. But he didn™t 
know. So he said you fired. So I s -- th
is was on a Wednesday, 
I remember, I said, 
ﬁNo, y -- I cannot be fired.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhat 
do you mean you cannot be fired?ﬂ I said,

ﬁBecause I quit last Friday.ﬂ So I lost a fe
w days, he never paid me. So then I went 
into other jobs and like I said, I had so many jobs, but each job -- 
Q: Ho-H ow many jobs did you have, and how -- 
A: Oh, I had -- I had ab out eight, nine jobs
, I don™t know. Because each job or -- you 
see, there were two reasons that -- or I was --
 I wanted to -- a device to make it better, 
or to do something, so they said well what 
-- he™s going to tell me , the boss, he had to 
teach me. And then I -- ye -- also , when I -- 
when I went on a job, the first day, the 
second day, I always was thi
nking, how long will it take me 
to take over this business, 
you know? This was in my  mind,
 or -- not to take away th 
-- to be in this business. 
Well, anyway, some guy, I told  him to co -- to
 correct, do this, and th en I -- yeah , I -- I 
-- you see, I was always -- home I was a busin
essman. I  was not staying there just to 
work  and not to -- well, anyway , after about
 a year and meanwh ile -- and my  wife got 
the job, so she -- from her money that we -- she made, so for on
e week we lived for 
two weeks, because we lived -- pay -- rents 
we didn™t pay, and everything was so 
cheap and we didn™t go out. 
I remember I had to make a phone call, it was five dol -- 
five cents, we had to think twice to make 
the phone call. And -- 
and after -- after -- I 
even had my  own business, I 
worked in a -- in a remnants
 place, we used to export 
remnants. I didn™t call 
them remn ants, I called 
remnantses
 because there were a lot of 
them. So one is a remnant, a lot is 
remnantses. 
So I --

Q: I -- I want to -- I want to ask you two 
specific questions -- two specific stories -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- because they were important, I thought.
 The first story was 
about when  you went 
to your cousin to the factory, to ask whet
her you would have a j
ob, and th ere™s a whole 
story connected when  you finally met 
Joe Siegel.
 Maybe you can kind of tell that 
story. 

A: Oh, you me -- yeah. Well, so I went and 
I looked for a job, but I -- one uncle is -- 
who was very nice, he was a poor uncle, an
d he never made a living, cause everything 
was on his mind, the whole fami ly. So he was 
very nice, so he went with me, and there 
was one cousin, and he -- and -- and -- and th
ey had the largest s
ilk company in the 
United States
, lining for 
[indecipherable]
 silk. Ven -- they were very well known, 
and -- and so I went to -- to th
e f -- to -- to them
 Sunday morning to 
visit the father, to 
ask my job. He said, ﬁWell, I am retired, 
but my son is the owner now from the how -- 
from the business you go to  him.ﬂ So he -- so I 
went over the next day naturally, I got 
dressed in my  best, a European
 coat, a European suit, a Eu
ropean hat. And naturally it 
was not like in 
America
. So I came in, there was a beau
tiful receptionist, and then she 
ask me what I want, so I -- my English, I sa
id, ﬁWell, I™m a cousin of -- of the -- your 
boss,ﬂ and his name was 
Saleschutz
, they never changed the name. I wanted -- so she 
told him and I went in. I went in, he was s
itting by his desk, he didn™t go a -- didn™t get

39
up, he didn™t shake hands. He looked at me
 and the first words he
 said, ﬁWhat do you 
want?ﬂ So  I told him, I saw yesterday your fa
ther and I need a job, I just came from -- 
no, the girl asked me who are you. I said, ﬁI have the same  name as your boss. His 
name is 
Saleschutz,
 I am 
Saleschutz.ﬂ 
Because this was before I changed my  name. 
So then he said what
 do you want. So I said, ﬁI came 
and I need a job.ﬂ And he -- they 
-- they had about 300 people wo rking there. 
So  he looked and looked at me , and he 
took out a wallet from his pocket,
 he took out a hundred dollar bill, put it on the table, 
and he said, ﬁTake it, and get o
ff my back.ﬂ And when
 he said to this, 
naturally I didn™t 
take the hundred dollars. Now, the tears fille
d up my eyes, and I -- I -- I couldn™t -- I 
couldn™t answer anything, and I couldn™t 
cry. It was like -- like sometimes you fall 
down from a -- from a ladder and -- and then -- 
and I was standing th ere, and -- and the 
minute I was standing there, when he told me 
this, and this went through very fast in 
my  mind, and what would I do if he would come to 
Poland
, and -- and -- and he will 
say this is my cousin. So I -- I visualize that I was in this
 time in -- in the army, I will 
make a -- a review, I-I put him on the reviewing stand 
[indecipherable]
 the army, 
we™ll go there, through will salute, and I™ll 
tell everybody this is my cousin. But here 
he said to me, take th e hundred dollars, get off my back. So I didn™t take it. Then, 
when I didn™t take it, he took it back, and 
put it in in his wallet, and he said, ﬁWell, 
another thought I™m going to give it to Un
ited Jewish Appeal, let them do what they 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

want with this money.ﬂ And I run out
, and as I came to this receptionist 
[indecipherable]
 room, I burst out in -- not in crying, but li -- I co uldn™t breathe. And 
I run out, she said, ﬁWhat™s wrong, what™s 
wrong?ﬂ So  I said nothing™s wrong, and I 
would run out, and I was staying in the ha
llway, and I was crying. I was 27 years old 
and I was crying. A man goes through, and -- 
and he said, ﬁHey mister, what™s wrong, 
what™s wrong?ﬂ So I said to him, ﬁAre you 
an American Jew?ﬂ He said yes. So I said, 
ﬁYou know, you should have been  in 
Auschwit z
 and be killed.ﬂ To him. So he said, 
ﬁWhy you say, why you curse at me there?ﬂ 
He says becau -- so I said to him, ﬁWhy 
should my father -- 
father be killed because he™s a 
Jew, and you live here, and you 
have everything.ﬂ I didn™t know what I am
 saying, it was a -- so he said, ﬁHey, why 
you cursing me?ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ So
 he says, ﬁYou know what, you ate lunch?ﬂ 

I said no. He said, ﬁI w ant you should co
me with me, I™m going to  eat lunch.ﬂ So I 
went with  him. And I stop crying, and I re
memb er we went into a luncheonette. And 
the first time I had this -- and he -- oh, he
 ask me what do you want. I said, ﬁI don™t 
know, I will have the same thing you have.ﬂ So I rememb er he ask 
[indecipherable]
 
cheese with the -- with the ve
getables with radishes, with onions, with  -- all chopped 
up together. And I liked it so I said I will have
 the same. And I ate, ate, I felt better. So 
he -- so he said, ﬁYou want the other one?ﬂ 
I said, ﬁNo, one is enough.ﬂ He said, ﬁNow 
tell me, why did you curse me, 
why did you cry?ﬂ So I told 
him the story. I told him

 happens that I am one of his customers.ﬂ I 
said you should go -- he said, ﬁYou come w
ith me. And I want y
ou should hit the son 
of a bitch in his nose, in his face, but I wa
nt to see blood.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁDon™t worry, 
nothing will happen to you, I will be with 
you.ﬂ I said you go and this guy deserved -- 
so I said, ﬁNo, I only can te ll you one thing, so long as 
I will be alive, I will never 
speak to him.ﬂ He gave me his card, and I rememb er his name was 
Louis Siegel
, and -
- and he gave me, he said, ﬁYou come and 
see me when you feel better.ﬂ And I came 
to him and he used to  buy -- he used to get re -- well, now 
remnantses
. And he used to  
see it to people who use like 
[indecipherable]
. And how did he get? He got -- he got 
these remnants -- remnants illegal. Why ille
gal? Because when th
ey send over to a 
converter material, an d when 
th ey dyed it, and th en after the dyeing, always shrunk 
maybe one percent, two percent. But he 
was a partner with the guy from the dyeing 
and he shrunk five percent. So from each piec
e he got a piece of six, seven yard s. And 
he got those things. No w, he paid 40 cents a 
-- a pound, and he sold it for four dollars a 
pound. So he said to me, ﬁI
™m going to give you every we
ek a case of remnants.ﬂ And 
he gave me the address where to sell it. And he told me how mu ch to  s -- for how 
much to sell it. And he said to -- to me
, ﬁI will charge you what I pay for it.ﬂ A 
stranger. And I went to him, and I did it 
once, maybe once a week, maybe once a 
month, how mu ch he told me to give it, a
nd I took those things 
and I dragged it to the

42
place -- to the wholesale place, and I accumulate nice mo ney. And he was always 
happy, he told me, this is what you have to get 
[indecipherable]
. One day I come into 
him, he was sitting, he was not sha -- yeah, 
this was when I want to -- when I came to 
him, it™s the first time that 
I saw a shirt white on white, I never saw it before, so I 
looked at him and I said something, a beautif
ul shirt, yeah. So  and one day I come in 
and he was sitting there not shaved
 and this and that, so I said, 
[indecipherable]
 what 
happened? He said -- he said 
to me, ﬁI™m in trouble. I™m in trouble, and the police is 
after me.ﬂ And he lost everyt
hing. And he lost everything, so I lost everything. But he 
was the nicest guy in th e -- he had a strange -- I never saw him 
[indecipherable]
 
family, nothing. So then later I started on my
 own to  buy, but I 
didn™t have money to  
do it. No w, there was a question about my  na
me. Now, th-the -- my -- my family -- yo 
-- 

Q: Let me -- let™s -- let™s skip that qu 
-- that one because I would like to ask you 
something else. When you were a peddler for a long time -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- 20 years ago, you told me last time one
 story where you walked up the stairs and 
you overh eard a young mo ther talking to 
the child. Could you 
tell that story? 
A: Yeah, well then later I had this 
[indecipherable]
 job, this job, th
en later somebody 
told me what do you have, what do you need
 the job, I will give
 you a good job. And 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

43
he had the wholesale place on in
 the -- on the east side that 
peddlers used to buy by 
him dry goods and this. So he said to me th
at -- and there -- and now then I met a lot of 
people wh o were peddlers and everybody in  th
is time they made money. So he said to 
me, ﬁWell, don™t look fo r a job, I™ll tell you 
what to do. I will give you merchandise 
and you go out, and I will tell 
you, and you sell it on paymen
ts, and you don™t have to 
buy the merchandise. And -- and then -- then later you will collect, we will split the 
profit.ﬂ So he says, ﬁHow do 
you like it?ﬂ Said -- so I said
, ﬁI like it very much under 
one ex ception.ﬂ He said, ﬁWell, what™s the 
exception?ﬂ I said, ﬁI will -- you will give 
me merchandise and then later we™ll be part
ners.ﬂ I said, ﬁI will get the merchandise, 
but I don™t want partners.ﬂ 
[indecipherable]
 So I -- they gave me some credit, and I 
started to -- to go to 
Jersey 
City, because in 
Jersey
 City there were Polish people. And 
then the problem was that a
ll my  customers lived on the fifth floor -- on the fo urth 

floor, there were no elev ators, and I had tw
o suitcase, and I had to drag the suit -- I 
couldn™t leave them downstairs, so I dragge
d them upstairs. And one time I came into 
one Polish woman, and she wa
s a young woman maybe 28 - 
29 years, and the door 
was open, and I hear she yells in it™s -- the 
child cries. So she -- she -- and she didn™t 
know I am in the doorway, and she starte
d to scream on the child, she said, ﬁStop 
crying because if you don™t stop crying, th
e Jew -- the Jew will come, he will take you 
away in his sack.ﬂ Th
is what she told to 
the child. So th
e child stopped crying. Then

when -- when -- then she goes
 out, she saw me, sh-she was a little -- not worried, but 
she 
[indecipherable]
. So I asked her, ﬁTell me, how co
me that you said to the child, 
stop crying because the Jew will come and take
 you away in the sack? So I mean, how 
many Jews did you see that they come aro
und and they grab ch
ildren?ﬂ She said, 
ﬁWell, I don™t know, but I reme mber when  I cr
ied, my  mo ther used to tell me  this. I 
always was so afraid that I stopped crying
. So  I am telling it to her.ﬂ And wh at I 
understood that this child will grow up and 
this child will tell it 
to her children. And 
this is how the -- the heritage from -- fro
m those people who didn™t know why she 
said, but she said it. So then, b-being a 
peddler, I -- I mad e out very well. And I 
reme mb er the first day, I have to tell you 
[indeciphera b le]
 becoming a peddler, I used 
to make 21 dollars a week. So
 then later when I became 
a peddler, so th
ey told me 
some -- some man told me, he brought me
 to a man, and he said to me to buy 
children™s socks. So I bough t hundred dozen children™s so
cks in two suitcases. And I 
paid -- I paid two dollars a dozen. And I went to 
Jersey 
City. In one day I sold a 
hundred -- everybody had ch ildren, and I so
ld them for three dollars a dozen, three 
dollars a dozen was cheap. And I made a 
dollar a dozen. And I 
sold in one day, 
hundred dozen children™
s socks, and I made hundred do
llars profit. When I made the 
hundred dollars profit -- this was the first day,
 I remember. So I said -- people used to 
say that in 
America
 money is laying on the street. It 
is laying on the street, but you

have to know how to pick it 
up. I said, this is for me. This is my country. If I could 
make the first day a hundred dollars a day,
 so I will -- I will remain  a peddler. And 
started to sell socks, then underwear, th-the
 dresses, then curtains, and I wind up th e 
end with furniture. I sold 
only furniture, I had the wa
rehouse. So this was the 
beginning of bein
g a peddler. So I was about 10 
years -- 10 years a peddler til I 
became a builder.  
Q: Let™s go back then , at one point you did go to 
Palestine --
 or to 
Israel
 at that time -
- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- I would like to -- to get a sense of wh
at it was like to be there, and what your 
family said to you, because yo
u were still thi
nking of 
moving. 
A: Yeah. When we -- when -- 
it was 29 -- in 1949, I was in 
America
 al -- almost -- 
almost two years, and I accumulate enough mone
y to go to -- also my 
wife in this time 
was a Hebrew teacher. And there was a special
 in the Hebrew Univ
ersity, there were 
special courses for American Hebrew teachers.  They -- they wanted
 to -- to make it a 
higher level. So sh -- we went and we did th
e train -- th is was the first time th ere was a 
plane to 
Israel 
in ™49. In the -- before there were 
no plane -- planes. So we went in the 
-- today, takes six hours to go to 
Israel
. In this time it to ok us 36 hours. We went -- we 
stopped in 
Newfo u ndla nd -- Newfo undla nd
, we stopped in 
Shanno n
, we stopped in -

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
46
- in 
Switzerland
, we stopped in  
Ro me
, cause they had to refuel, and -- and then we 
came to 
Isr a el.
 I reme mb er -- and they had a lot of problems, the people who were 
with us in th e -- on th e -- on the plane, becau
se we stopped in all those places, so we 
went down. And every time we went down  we 
couldn™t go up because we didn™t have 
per -- papers, we only had a piece of paper th
at we are -- and we ju st came . So it took 
long, and they didn
™t like it, but anyway, we came to 
Isr a el
. And I will never forget 
the -- th-the feeling when -- when the plane came over 
Israel
, you s -- look out 
through the window, you see s -- yellow sa
nd, yellow sand. Then
 later, suddenly you 
see like a n ice green, garden. And this was 
Isr ael 
[
indecipherable
]. And whenwe 
were 
[indecipherable] 
we started  to sing, and -- and then I went down, so I lay -- 
kneeled down on th e ground, and 
I started to kiss the -- the -- the earth, and we started 
to cry, and -- and -- and it was -- the family
 was waiting for us, my wife™s family, my 
brother was family and they took us home
. And t -- they were very happy as -- 
naturally it™s the first time th
at -- that my wife saw her gr
andmother after the war, that 
she survived, and my brother, and with the children. Now,we came -- we wanted  to 
remain. And we said we have nothing in -- in
 America
. We -- I make a living, but we 
have no ties. Th-The -- the rooms, we had th
e same  room where this Italian guy gave 
us, and we wanted -- and th en it was very bad in 
Israel
. I don™t know if you know 
what means 
senna
. 
Senna
 was a time that -- that 
everything was on cards, you

couldn™t buy this, you couldn™t buy this, a
nd th e people didn™t made money -- it was a 
very t-terrib -- because they had all the ne
w immigrants, there wa
s no industry. So we 
said to -- I -- I said I alwa
ys wanted to -- to live in 
Israel, 
and I -- so we -- so the 
family got together, and they said, ﬁYou 
-- you came too late.ﬂ Why too late? Would 
you come when  you wanted befo re the war, 
I could be very imp-important in the war. 
They  didn™t have professional soldiers, I 
was, and -- and I wanted to fight for 
Israel
, 
but the war is ended, and the -- everybody 
-- so what will you do, you will come over 
here, we will have two more mouths to feed
, we don™t have food. 
And we then -- what 
will you do, and you -- says you are in 
America
, you establish yourse
lf a little bit, you 
making out all right. Go back , make money,
 send us the money. And this was the 
reason why -- and my wife wanted to stay be
cause she had there a sister, and her sist er 
was starving, she had the farm, and they di
dn™t have what to give to eat to the 
chickens, it was -- it w as terrible. So we cam
e back and -- and this was -- th -- then 
later we went every year, every two years, 
but this was the re -- the reason we went 
over, because we wanted to stay. Because I s-
said if I su rvive the war, I have to g -- I 
have to live in 
Israel.
 And even  til today, my bigges
t regret, if you ask me about 
regrets in life, my  biggest regret is that I didn™t go to 
Israel
, not in this time, but before 
Israel 
was established. Because if I -- who 
would -- who had to 
go? I was 27 years 
old. Who had to go to 
Israel 
to fight, if not a survivor of the Holo caust who was 27 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
48
years old? And special when I had the sc
hooling wh at the Ru ssians gave me, the 
schooling that I could ba -- so even til today,
 I always say this is my biggest regret. 
And I have articles in this 
new book ab out those things.  
Q: Now in the -- while -- while you are work ing 
in the early years, in
 -- in very -- first 
year, or second year in 
America
, too, you were also training fo r comb at. Can you tell 
about that a little bit? You -- 
you meant to go and fight 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah, well, when I was startin g in the 
first year, so I belo
nged to undergro unds, 
which from like they were illegal -- illegal 
organizations. You probably know there 
was the 
Haganah
, but there were more ra
dicals, it was the -- the 
sten
 group, the 
atsel
 
where 
Begin 
was. So I belonged  to those organizations, because I was in my  mi nd -- 
my mind was, eventually I wa
nt to go. This was before 
Israel 
was li -- was 
established. So we -- we had -- there was 
one man, he sa -- he was a major in the 
British army, he™s no -- his name was 
Weiser
. He actually was from 
South Africa
, but 
he was in British army. And he came to 
America
, and he organize,
 and he called it 
George Wa shington
 Legion. And the 
George Wash ington
 -- because there was once 
a 
George Washin gton 
Legion that they we
nt in to fight for 
Ireland
, but this was 
before. So  he organized this and he got peop
le together, he wanted  to organize it here, 
and to -- equipped -- to be e
quipped here, and to go to 
Palestine
 in this time to fight as 
a unit. And he -- we worked, and we -- we 
had meetings every week, and I rememb er 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
49
the meetings were -- th ere was a hotel, 
Algonquin 
Hotel in 
New York
. We had to 
have the meetings, naturally. I went to 
the meeting, now ev
erybody in mostly 
Mosul 
they had people who belonged to th is th
at were veterans, who came back from -- 
American veterans, who didn™t have wh at to 
do. They came back, 
some were Zionists, 
some were not Zionists, that 
they wanted to do something.
 Also, we had a -- a lot of 
black soldiers that they came
, and tha -- this was a opportunity. So we ha -- and I were 
-- and they establish a staff, and I was picked
 up, in the staff I wa
s picked out -- I was 
made that I am the head of the milita
ry police, because my background in 
Poland
, so 
lo -- and I was very happy, and we work ed 
and wer -- and then it was -- he tried to get 
the permission from the American government, 
and they refused him. They said that 
you can go individually, but not as organi
zation. A-A-Ag ain, individually, it means 
illegal. But not as our -- he wanted to have
 a organization equipped, and money should 

come from 
America. 
So when I -- when this happened to
 them in this time, I also -- I 
started -- I belonged -- this was li
quidated, so I belonged to the 
atsel,
 to the extreme 
revolutionaries, they™re from 
Isra el
, so I belonged and then I wanted to go and they 
prepared. And my je -- I work
ed, but also my job was th
at we collected guns from 
veterans in 
America
 and we sent them over. Now, the 
guns had to be packed . So we 
had a place, by some Jew who he -- was a furrier on 27
th
 Street, and I went there after I 
worked, I went over ev
-every night, and what we did,
 we -- we cleaned the guns, and 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

50
we put them -- we packed th
em in barrels, and we closed it, and then there was 
camouflage 
[indecipherable]
 material, and -- and this had to go to 
Israel
, to pal -- to 
Palestine
 in this time for 
the people from the 
atsel
. And then one day we were packing 
this and the police came in. 
Somebody in -- squealed, I 
don™t -- we didn™t know what, 
and they arrested us. They 
-- we were there about eight, 
nine people. They arrested, 
they confiscated the -- the guns, and I was taken to jail. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
A: -- And one day we were packing th is
 and the police came in. Somebody in -- 
squealed, I don™t -- we didn™t know what, a
nd they arrested us. They -- we were there 
about eight, nine people. They arrested, 
they confiscated the -- the guns, and I was 
taken to jail. And I was in jail a 
herely
 -- I -- I just came from 
Europe
 and I was a 
stranger and I™m already in jail. And I was 
there overn ight, and the next day a group 
came, and the police, and started to inte
rrogate us. And then after they ask me 
questions, they let us go. So they let us go,
 the reason why is because there were a lot 
of influential Jews in th -- with the police to
gether. Well, now, legally I didn™t have to 
look here, we pack 
[indecipherable]
 everything was illegal, but they let us go, they 
said to go out. So -- but I st
ill went there, and they prep
ared us to go illegal, through 
Marseilles, 
to 
France
 to go to 
Israel.
 I even -- we had a cousin
, she was a nurse in the 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
51
hospital, and I talked her in, and she said 
she will go with us. A
nd then one day -- one 
day I came there and they said well, Sunday
 mo rning you transport is going, and -- and 
I came home, and I said to my  wife, I am going, and she was against it. And I started -- 
I took wh at I could, a -- a knapsack, and I 
-- and sh e said to me, ﬁIf y ou are going you 
must know one thing. You ar
e going but you cannot come 
back to me. I will not wait 
for you, and I don™t care what, because I kno
w you will go, you will
 be killed. And -- 
and -- and -- and I don™t -- I lost 
too many people in -- in -- in 
Europe
, and I don™t 
want to have 
[indecipherable]
 so you -- you can go, I cann
ot stop you. But you cannot 
come back to me.ﬂ We
ll, I felt very bad, and we had to
 meet in this hotel, we had to 
meet Sunday mo rning and then  a truck had to ta
ke us in -- to the -- to a boat, to go to  -- 
to ma -- to 
France
, and from 
France 
to 
Israel
. And I got wh at I had to take and I went 
there -- over there, and -- and then they -- 
when I was there, so I was thinking wa -- 
what my wife told me, and I said I am 
not going. They  were very mu ch surp rised 
because they liked me. Now,
 my cousin, th -- ma -- 
Marilyn Petranka
, she went, and 
she was a nurse durin g the war, and she 
met a -- a young English doctor who was 
Jewish, and they fell in love, and th
ey got married, and th ey live now in 
Ca nada
. They 
have children. But she was in during th e 
whole war, because they needed nurses and 
she was a registered nurse. And I never, ne
ver went. This was -- this was before -- 
before ™40 -- it was in ™40 s -- in ™47, the year that we arrived to 
America
.

Q: In those early years, who were your friends? 
A: Well, first I have to tell you -- I don™t kn
ow if I told you ab out changing my  name, 
this is very important. I don™t know if I told you the last time? 
Q: Yeah, you di -- you -- you to ld already on
 the other interview, but I didn™t -- I -- 
A: Yeah, okay 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Who were your friends in this? 
A: Well, th -- in the beginning, all my fre 
-- y ou see, my family, I had a large family, 
and my family was very, very not 
helpful. Like -- also, we came to 
America
,
 
you see -
- wh-when we wanted to go to 
Palestine 
in this time, and I wanted to go to 
America
 if 
we cannot go to 
Palestine, 
because I said that all the co
usins are my age. Why? See, 
my father was the youngest from -- from th
e brothers, I was the youngest from us. And 
they had children and the childre
n were my age. I said, I h a
ve cousin s. This uncle has 
children, this uncle has childre n. So they were -- we will be
 close. They were very -- 
they never invited us. We were strange to
 them. And -- and in -- th-they were -- the 
children were rich, they didn™
t give me jobs. And we as
ked them for it. Now, the 
reason why is because they l
ooked on us with the eyes as
 they will see their parents 
came when they came in 
1885 - 1890. When
 they came in 18 ni 
-- in 1890, they came 
from a village. They ne
ver wore shoes in the village. 
They were not educated. They 
came over here when they were 14 -- eight -- 
14 - 15 - 16 years, and they had to start 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
53
in -- in the -- in -- they never made out of 
-- of their life something. One was a presser, 
one was a tailor, one was a button hole make
r. The children already were educated -- 
were 
[indecipherable]
. So they looked at
 us, they didn™t realize that we had a 
progress. 
America
 also had a progress. 
America
 in 1947 was not th
e same as in 1885. 
But they looked at us with the stories what 
their parents told us 
-- told them. So we 
were never their friends -- they were neve
r -- which we expected to be liked. For 
instance, there is one woman, she still a 
-- she™s 94 years now, and she was my first 
cousin, her name was 
Frances
. And I was already six months here and I didn™t see 
Frances
 and I knew the stories about 
Frances
, because she was a older woman, she 
was already 32 years and she wasn™t married
. So my father, everything was on his 
mind. So he always, my father, when
 he had problems, when  he thinks 
[indecipherable]
 so he used ta -- take his beard, 
and he used to chew his beard. So 
when  he chews his beard, so we said, ﬁWhat™s wrong?ﬂ He said
 Frances
. He got a 
letter 
Frances
 wasn™t married, sh e™s already 32 
years. He always worried about 
Frances
. So when 
Frances -- 
when I was 
[indecipherable]
 then later she got married, 
she had a daughter. I was six months, so once I called up
 Frances. 
I says, ﬁ
F rances, 
I™m already here six months, and -- and my
 father always worried about you, and I 
wanted to  see you.ﬂ She was a daughter of my  father™s sister. So she said, ﬁOh yeah.ﬂ 

This was a Sunday, and I had already -- I sp
ent five cents for a telep h one call. She 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
54
said, ﬁYeah, I would like to see you too,
 come over sometimes.ﬂ So I says, ﬁ
Frances
, 
why should I come over sometime s? Today is
 Sunday, I don™t wo rk, my  wife doesn™t 
work. Why can™t we come over 
today?ﬂ Because she lived in 
Brooklyn 
too. Sh e said, 
ﬁOh, I already have some friends coming to 
my house.ﬂ When she sa
id to me this, I-I -
- I -- I didn™t say anything, I hu
ng up. Now, if she had friends
, this was the best time to 
invite us, we should be -- and we should kn
ow fre -- so what, she 
was afraid to show 
off with the -- the greener animals, or those 
things, so this was their feeling. Now, my 
wife was more educated than 
they. Now, for instance, in 
the beginning th ey were very 
-- they were angry at me why I -- I got ma
rried. So my wife wa
s beautiful, she was 
very intelligent, she spoke seven languages,
 and everything -- they didn™t -- so -- so 
they said -- even my brothe r said to me, ﬁWhy do you ha
ve to rush ? You are a young 
fellow, you are not so bad looking, you c
ould marry here a woman. All right, maybe 
she would be a -- a divorcée, or a -- maybe 
she™ll be a little older, but she will have 
two houses, she will have a busin ess, you woul
dn™t have to worry, you wouldn™t have 
to start for scratch, why do you have to 
marry?ﬂ Now, I couldn™t understand instead to 
be happy, that I brought over my wife, th
at she was prettier than
 they, she was more 
intelligent than they, 
she was smarter than they, she su
rvived the war. 
So they said, 
why did you have to ru sh, why ya -- and I was 27 years. You see, th -- the -- there was 
no feeling, there was no understanding. There was only this one elderly -- the -- the 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
55
one, the poor brother, 
Shulem
 we called him.  He was the one
 nice guy. From the rest, 
there was no -- see, my  wife™s family was diffe
rent. My wife™s family
 took us in like -- 
like a family. Why? Because th
ey knew them. My wife™s fam
ily came in ™38, so whe -- 
they lived in 
Berlin
. So they knew
 them, they used to 
come and visit them 
[indecipherable]
 they knew them how they lived, th
ey knew them ho
w th ey went to 
school, they knew them they were different 
people. So they took 
us in like we would 
be their children, even til today.  
Q: Who were your friends then ? Di
d you have any friends at all? 
A: Yes, I had friends, mostly we had friends
 survivors. We fre -- we had a few friends 
who were survivors, right away I was involv
ed in a group, and people that I knew from 
Poland
, and also people who were very ap
preciative what I did for them in 
Poland
, 
and -- and we remained friends til today. 
And -- and the only thi
ng is that now all 
those people are dying out. Th
ey™re dying out but -- but we
 still have this, and even 
today, mostly we -- we are close mostly w
ith people who are survivors. We have some 
who are not, neighbors, this, but i-it™s not a 
deep friendship as -- because they cannot 
understand. And -- and -- the -- the -- the -- 
look, I belong, see I-I™m -- I am d ifferent 
than my wife. My wife, she b -- she does -- 
if she belongs to organization, she just 
pays the dues and that™s it. And if I belong 
to organization, I have 
to be active. I used 
to be president from my 
Kobulshovera [indecipherable]
 from the town. I am still 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
56
president from the Israeli Red Cross. I™m president from here, I™m president -- why? 
Because if I am involved, I have to  be i
nvolved, otherw ise I don™t want to bother. My 
wife -- now, from all those groups that -- that
 I am involved with the organizations, we 
have friends, but we are, I don™t know, so cl
ose as with the people who are survivors. 
For instance, last year I had a very
 big -- things happened. I bi -- the 
B™nai Brith -- 
you know what 
B™nai Brith
 -- and I used to be very active, and I am still -- and we 
have a -- a board from the local 
B™nai Brith, 
and -- and once a mo nth we have a 
meeting, and -- and then once we always ma
ke a, once a year, on one of the me etings 
we have a film. And we show th e film and the people come and the m -- the 

memb ersh i p , no t on ly
 the board . So when  th-the presid
ent said, let™s have a film, I saw 
a film from 
Woody Allen
. And 
Woody Allen
, a wonderful comedy, let™s have a film 
from him. I -- I don™t like 
Woody Allen
 as a human being, I don™t like him as a Jew, I 
don™t like him at all, because he™s too 
-- he™s -- so I said 
why should we have 
Woody 
Allen™s
 film? It so happens that I 
got a new film, it™s called, ﬁ
The Rescuers,ﬂ 
maybe 
you saw it. And ﬁ
The Rescuers
ﬂ is a wonderful film, it is 
-- the first is a Polish girl, a 
Polish woman who was -- took a -- a Jewish 
boy for two years. The father of the 
Jewish boy was a doctor, the mother was la
wyer, but anyway, they
 became -- she was 
a nanny for the boy, and they were taken away
 and they were killed, and they gave the 
boy to the -- this woman. And she promised
 them to -- that she will save it. And it 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
57
shows the whole film how she save it, her 
problems she had. Sh e survived  the war and 
the boy went to pales -- to 
Israel
, and she went with him to 
Israel. 
She never changed 
her religion. She™s Catholic, but she wanted 
to be with  the boy, an d the boy is happy, 
he studied. Beautiful story. And then the 
second story is about the French wo man, a 
French woman, she never ge -- never saw Jews
. And in her village 
there was -- they -- 
they started -- those were -- how you ca
ll the French that they who -- who -- 
Huguenots? 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
Hu gu eno t s. 
A: Yeah, so they were very 
friendly and th ey took
 in about 40 Jews, Jewish children, 
and the whole village tried to save them. A
nd this girl, she was a young girl, worked -- 
a secretary by th e bishop. And -- and -- and she 
helped  -- and she saved ab out 40. It™s a 
beautiful -- you know. So I said let™s show 
the -- it™s not a bloody thing that people 
don™t want to see. It is a human interest
, like two girls, two persons, two wo men, how 
they saved the Jews, it™s very beau tiful. And wh
en I said it, let™s have this film. So one 
guy was sitting there, he said, ﬁStop with this 
crap of the Holocaust. 
Only I hear is this 
crap the Holocaust, Holocaust, I have it til he
re. Isn™t it time we shouldn™t talk about 
the Holocaust?ﬂ When he started to say crap, 
crap, Holocaust, either
 I -- I was so numb 
that I couldn™t answer him, I couldn™t belie
ve it. Then later when
 I felt better, so I 
opened my mouth. I said, ﬁYou call the Holo
caust crap? Six million Jews were killed.

It was just yesterday, I™m still alive. A 
millio n and a half child
ren. And -- and you 
should say it on a Jewish -- 
in a Jewish organization, 
B™nai Brith?ﬂ 
And I -- and -- 
and, so he said, ﬁWell we suffered too.ﬂ 
I says, ﬁWhen did you su ffer?ﬂ She -- you -- 
you didn™t have enough steak,
 you had to eat chicken?ﬂ Be
cause they would not have -
- and I walked out and I said, ﬁI am not 
coming here any mo re.ﬂ Now, it didn™t -- not 
so much that this idiot said
 stop with this crap, with 
the always -- there were 18 
people, and nobody said a wo
rd . None of them opened their mouth. And after this I 
wrote a letter to the interna
tional president, he never answ ered me, and to th e people I 
didn™t go back. So I -- and those were most
ly American who -- I said, you have here 
your family, your fathers, your mothers, yo
ur children are here, your grandchild ren are 
here. Those people didn™t suffer. And 
[indecipherable]
 for him, it is enough. We 
talked about the Holocaust en
ough. So -- so you ask about friends. I feel comfortable 
when I am between somebody -- now, I was 
very active -- now I™m not so active. We 
have the 
Vagra,
 the 
Warsaw
 uprise organization. Every year -- every year we make a 
commemoration in the -- used to be 
Ma d i son
 Square Garden. And I was the chairman 
from the arrangement and security. And I wa
s -- I was v ery much
 involved, because 
we had all people survivors. And with su
rv ivors I can feel -- today in the mo rning 
somebody called me up, a man, 
and he tells me a story, 
her survive. He was very 
happy to talk to me, and I was happy to talk
 to me, because we went through different 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
59
ways, but we always went thro ugh th e same. He
 lost a family, I lost
 a family. So but -- 
but American Jews, they are s -- n o w, there 
are some that they -- 
like for instance, in 
o u r  T e mp le, th ey ™re mak i ng  a comme mo rati
on about the Holocaust. Few people come, 
and it™s not -- they didn™t 
want to go th rough it.  
Q: Let™s make me the connection to 
the beginning then , 
when you came to 
America
, 
when  you spoke, and you always spoke, I think. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did -- did people know ab out it, did they  want to hear about it? 
A: They didn™t want to hear it. No, they 
wanted -- they always
 thought that I am 
obsessed and th ey didn™t want
 to hear it, and they -- they avoided me. They av oided 
me because I spoke about it. They didn™t 
want to know, and -- and -- and they  didn™t 
want to hear, and I always spoke, and I to
ld them stories. Some people didn™t say 
anything -- I mean, the surviv
ors -- then, because they didn™t want to listen to people. 

Then later, in -- in -- in 
the 70™s, in the -- with 
Eichmann™s
 trial, films came out, then 
the people started to be a little more intere
sted, and then they le
arned about it. But in 
the beginning -- like fo r instance, my  family. 
They  didn™t want to 
know. They -- now, I 
have a other -- I had the man that he had 
the nieces and nephews and he ask me all 
kind of questions, so I ask hi
m, you ask me all kind of que
stions, but you never ask me 
about the nieces, about your nephews, about ot
her -- oh yeah, I had in  mind to -- to ask 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

you this. I said, ﬁBut you didn™t.ﬂ They  didn™t 
want to listen, they 
didn™t want to hear. 
And they -- when I tell stories, they said -- they avoi
ded me, because I am obsessed 
with the Holocaust. 
Q: And that was from both, that was Americ
an and then non -- non-Jewish, but also 
Jewish community didn™t
 really want to -- 
A: Well, the non-Jewish, it was -- no, I wa
s not in contact so, about non-Jews, and I 
didn™t -- I didn™t tell them, but I™m talking 
about Jewish from organizations when I -- 
we came. Then later, it became our -- I™m st
arting to be invited and -- to schools, to 
public schools. Now, for instance, the 27
th
, what is -- next week. The 
[indecipherable] 
I have to go to 
George Washington
 University, I was there last year, and they invited 
me again, I should come 
to speak. So I am staying there two days, and -- in 
Washin gton.
 Now, a few months ago I was invited to  
Norfolk, Virginia
, to speak 
there for a Jewish central organizations. Now,
 I spoke in one scho
ol, then later there 
are three schools, so each one in
vited me to his school. So I was 
[indecipherable]
 
instead one day, I was there three days. Al
so they invite me that I should speak 
because I don™t take money for it. Li
ke for instance, in same school in 
No rfo l k, 
Virginia
, 
Elie Wiesel
 was there about two weeks befo
re me, and he took 25,000 
dollars. So -- so I said -- he
 spoke a half an hour, and 
I didn™t take anything and I 
spoke three hours. So -- so
 I told them, there is no bu
siness like show business -- not 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
61
show business -- like - -
 not show-a -- like 
Shoah 
business. You know, 
Sho ah 
is -- gets 
25,000 dollars. Look, somebody sa
id, he is at the normal pri
ce, but still, takes a lot of 
money. 
Q: You did tell me in the first interview 
about a story when -- when  you heard in 
synagogue that a rabbi -- rabbi said they 
didn™t really know what was happening, and 
you had researched 
it, and you saw -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Could you tell that story? 
A: Yeah, this was in the beginning, and th e -- when I spoke about the Holocaust, and 

so then the rabbi said, well th
e people, they  said, we didn™t
 know. We didn™t know if it 
-- I say -- in the -- so if we didn
™t know -- and so I went to the 
[indecipherable]
 daily 
[indecipherable]
 and they had microfilms from -- so
 I picked out microfilms from the 
time, from 1942, becaus
e there where the mass killings st arted. And in the microfilms 
I had all articles, every day, this cam
p and this camp in this town, this 
[indecipherable]
. They™re making copies -- I made 
copies, and I came back to -- to 
the same synagogue, and I said, ﬁYou didn
™t know? Here it is. You knew, but you 
didn™t read it.ﬂ If -- there was an English pa
per, and if the English paper put it in on the 
15
th
 page, a little this, so -- but in the Jewi
sh paper, it was always written down and -- 
and in the -- and you -- you knew it. Now, ther
e is also -- there is 
also -- I told them 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
62
that people were not interested, because in
 the same paper, it was -- well, 3,000 Jews 
were killed in this town. In just the next 
page, it -- it says 3,000 stocks were -- w ere 
sold yesterday on th e stock market. In the 
same breath, you speak about 3,000 Jews, 
and 3,000 shares of stocks from this comp an
y. But in the beginning -- and I -- I -- my  
br -- 
Q: So -- so you think it wa
s difficult for people to -- to
 unders -- to kind of put it 
together, or -- 
A: No, e -- e -- well, not that it was differ -- di
fficult, they didn™t want to believe -- and 
nobody could understand, even til today, 
how could a thing like 
this happen. Here, 
when -- when you see a -- even no
w, when you see a disaster in 
India
, it™s a terrible 
disaster, where 12,000 people, 14,000 were ki
lled. It was a disast
er made by God, not 
by people. And here, when  you take a town
, like my wife™s town
, in one day they 
killed 12,000 people. Killing 12,00
0 people for -- for no reason 
at all. And this was in 
every town, not in one town . Ho w can a hum
an mind comprehend this? Now, a -- a -- 
it™s a -- it™s a -- I don™t know if sa 
-- you heard about it, there™s a Dr. 
Gross, 
you know, 
a gr -- he™s a professor in -- in 
New York, NYU
. He™s a very good friend, because he 
edited one of my books. So this Dr. 
Gross, 
he™s from 
Poland
, his father was a judge in 
Kraków
, a Jew, and he married a non-Jew, a Po
lish, and she helped
 him to survive. 
He was born after the war, he started in 
Warsaw.
 Now he came here, he™s here. Now, 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
63
he made the study -- he made the study about
 -- about killing of -- so there is a town, 
Jedwabne,
 a small to wn near 
Warsaw
. In 
Jedwabne
 were 18,000 Jews -- no, a 
thousand eight hun -- 1800 Jews. In 
Jedwabne
 in one day, all the Jews were pushed in 
in a barn, and they were all bur
ned to death in one day. No w, 
peppel --
 people knew 
that this was in the time of
 the Germans, that the -- th
at the Germans -- that the 
Germans did it, right? So -- but this was 
-- he went, and he -- he -- he had some 
inclinations that it wasn™t done 
by the Germans, so he went to 
Jedwabne
, he found 
there witnesses, Polish witnesses. Th
en  he found out that two Jews from 
Jedwabne
 
survived there in 
Israe l, 
he went to 
Israel
 and he wrote the book, I have the book,
 
and 
he -- the book is called -- just came out, it™s called , ﬁ
Sasiedziﬂ
 in Polish. ﬁ
Sasiedziﬂ
 
means Neighbors. And he describes that th
e 1800 people were killed by Poles. The 
Pole -- the Germans were there,
 they were standing th ere, th
ey saw it, but they didn™t 
interfere because they were ve
ry happy somebody else is doing it. So the Polish people 
killed all the Jews from their to
wn where they lived together 
three, four hundred years. 
And they burned -- they
 pushed them in, and 
then he described the owner of th e barn, 
and the owner of the barn said he didn™t want
 to do it, that they forced him. Some were 
later arrested. They pushed them in, they 
poured gasoline and they
 burned all alike. 
Now if you -- in -- in the -- in
 the book is so -- now, wh-w
h-what he describes, that 
before they pushed in, there wa
s a child. The Poles were sta
nding with knives and th ey 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

64
took out the eyes from the ch
ildren, and they threw in th
e children. Now, they knew 
that they will be killed. Why 
did they have to do it in th
e -- it™s such bestiality, such 
terrible thing. Now, the book just came out
, so I told him the bo
ok has -- I want to 
translate it. He said, ﬁIt™s being now translat
ed into English, and in to Hebrew.ﬂ So it 
will come out maybe in a month or two mont
hs. But the English version came out last 
month. 

Q: Did -- did you want to have ch ildren? 
A: I wanted to have -- when we 
got -- when we got together in 
Poland
, we didn™t want 
to have children. Course we beli -- we spoke 
about it, and we decided we don™t want to 
bring in children to such a world because 
we wouldn™t know wh at happened in  -- and 
like my sisters, all th
e children, they were killed, so 
why should we br
ing in children 
into world? And then in -- so we didn™
t want. Then later when we came to 
America
, 
so we figured we are now in 
America
, it™s a different country 
and everything, we want 
to have ch ildren. So  it took us 11 years, 
we -- we didn™t have a child. After 11 years 
we ha -- we wanted to adopt, but I didn™t want to adopt on the 
black market. So we 
went to a doctor, and the doctor to see if 
ther e™s somethi ng wrong 
with me, or with my 
wife, and the doctors, well they said, there™
s nothing wrong with  y
ou tw o. So  we don™t 
have the children. So we want
 to ad -- adopt not 
with black markets and we went to a 
legitimate 
Steven Bryce
 adoptio n. And we want to adopt
, we made the application, it

took about a year, and they 
gave a case wer -- a worker, and sh e was very nice, and -- 
and she told us that they will approve
 it. And one day, which was before 
Thanksgiving, she come to our house, and this time we lived in 
Brooklyn
, she saw the 
apartment, and we showed he
r we have one room reserved
, and we going to  put it for a 
-- for a child. And she and I made already in
 this time a good living. My wife was a 
teacher, and I had a good business already. I 
still was a p eddler. And she said, ﬁI think 
you will have a very good Th
anksgiving,ﬂ beca
use they were ready 
to give us a child. 
And we says, ﬁWell, w e prefer if we can ge
t a girl.ﬂ We wanted to  have a girl. And 
then, befo  -- before about two months and befo
re she said that probably we™ll have it, 
sh -- they switched her and we got the ot
her worker. And the fi
rst minute when she 
came to house, we saw right away  that she™
s not the same person. She looked at my  
wife and she was -- we saw that she is ve
ry jealous. And the wa
y she talked to my 
wife, and my wife was maybe prettier, we 
h ad a nice apartment. And -- and she was 
not so nice as the other one to us. And then  
later we got a letter that we were rejected. 
It was a very terrible shock to us. And the 
reason why we™re rejected is because they 
don™t -- they -- they don™t believe that we, 
aft er going through so
 much, that we are 
normal people, that we will be able to bring 
up a child like in a no
rmal home. And this 
was the terrible thing. I had people who wr
ote letters, people who I helped very  mu ch -
- like, for instance, there was a Dr. 
Rosenhow
, he was one of the biggest professors in 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
66
the world, and I did a lot of things for 
him. He was in this time a professor in 
Colu mbia
, he was a very -- a international known 
eye doctor. So I told
 him this, so he 
wrote a letter, and some other 
[indecipherable]
 what I did to him -- for him. And -- 
and there was other me n, but th
en they said once it™s reje
cted, nobody can correct it. 
But nothing wrong with us, the 
only thing that they don™t th
ink that we will be able to 
bring up a child. If -- well, anyw
ay. So then I said I have no 
-- I have no choice, so we 
find somebody that we can get 
a child on the black
 market, and we got in touch with a 
wo man  from 
Philadelphia
, and in this time she said fo
r 8,000 dollars we can get a 
child. And so we agreed, and I gave no mone
y in advance. She said the minute when  
they was here -- we told her we want to ha
ve a newborn child, and if -- a -- a girl, and 
if she will have it, I will come an d 
pick it up and gi-giv
e her the money. 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
67
Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
A: -- well, anyway. So then I 
said I have no -- I have no choice, so we find somebody 
that we can get a child on the black market
, and we got in touc
h with a woman from 
Philadelphia
, and in this time she said for 8,000 
dollars we can get a child. And so we 
agreed, and I gave no money in  advance. 
She said the minute wh
en they was here -- 
we told her we want to have a newborn ch ild
, and if -- a -- a girl, and if she will have 
it, I will co me and pick it up and gi-give her 
the money. We received a letter -- a -- a 
telephone from her, so she said, ﬁCome to 
Philadelphia
, a child was born to day, in 
three days come, you can pick
 up the child.ﬂ When I go
t the cel -- telephone, about 
four days before, my wife went to the doct
or, and he made a rabbit test, and he says 
that she is pregnant -- well, 
a few days before. Naturally we
 told her that we change 
our mind, and 
Esther
 was born. Then  after -- after this she was pregnant about three 
times, she had miscarriages. Cause I wanted 
to have a large family, cause we were 
nine children. So sh e -- so that we were th
inking about adoption, then later we decided 
no, because if we have one our
 daughter, we™d -- we didn™t 
think that we will have the 
same feelin g for some -- for 
adopted child. If we wouldn™t have our own, so maybe we 
could adopt two. But once 
we have our own, so we
 thought we will deprive 
Esther
. So 
she was -- a few times she had mi
scarriages, and this is it. 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
68
Q: Did you have particular ho
pes or values that you wanted 
to instill in your -- in your 
child, for 
Esther
? 
Q: Hopes and values? Yes. Hope of -- the firs
t hopes and values is to -- to install in her 
a value of Judaism. Not a value of Judaism, 
about religion, God, bu
t to be proud being 
a Jew, what the Jews did. This what I am 
proud, what the Jews did, fa -- through the 
4,000 years since 
Abraham, 
what they did to human beings, wh at they did to th e 
world, including th e 10 commandments, including 
Jesus
, even. That -- how come that 
-- that -- even with the Ca
tholics, when  they  believe, said God picked out 
Ma ry  
to 
have a child, that God is a father, how come
 she didn™t go to a 
-- to a Spanish woman, 
or to a Po lish woman, or to a Irish woman 
and have a child -- if -- if I would believe 
what a Catholic believes. And to have a 
child with -- with -- with one of those 
nationality. So why did He pick out a Jewish girl, to have a child with a Jewish girl? 
So probably there is 
something more to it. Now -- whic
h I don™t believe in all those 
things. Now, I believe in 
Jesus
, far as a human being. Now, he was -- if 
Jesus
 
wouldn™t be made now, the religion was ma de
 200 years later they started to write. If 
Jesus
 wouldn™t be ma de a God, he
 would be a prophet by th
e Jews, because he was a -
- a -- a -- a man that he tried to help th
e underdog. His friends were fishermen, 
shepherds, prostitutes, all those things becaus
e he wanted to help them. He was a very 
ethical man . And so I believe in this, but I don™t believe that 
Jesus
 had anything to do 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

with God. I mean, he was a religious man. 
Jesus
 was a
 Nazere
, a naze -- I don™t know 
if you know what means a 
Nazere
. A
 Nazere
 means that he didn™t want to have too 
much pleasure from a life on this world. Li ke -- like he -- he never cu t his hair, he 
never drin k whiskey, he never had a wo
man. Well, those were as people, and 
Jesus
 
was one of these. You -- you cut it off? 
Q: No. 

A: Now I -- I don™t know if I told you last time I had a grandfather. My grandfather 
was a very, very pious Jew, he was a very learned Jew, he was very well known that 
he was one of the biggest scholars. In 1875
 he wrote a book, and the book was in -- in 
-- 
Jesus
 in -- 
[indecipherable]
 mean s 
Jesus 
from 
Nazareth. 
He wrote it in Hebrew, 
and this book was never pub
lished. And I rememb er we had one manuscript home, 
written by hand, beautiful written.
 I would give ever
ything if I would ha
ve to take that 
book, but the book got 
lost. And he wrote it in -- in this time, a Jew to write about 
Jesus
, it was sacrilegious because 
the Jew -- the Jews even 
didn™t want to mention 
Jesus™s
 name. So he wrote about him, and he -- 
this what he explained. He explains 
that
 Jesus
 was born, and he was -- he had a very
, very hard childhood because all his 
friends they  used to  call him names because he
 was born out of wedlock. So they used  
to call him -- in Hebrew is
 mumser. Mumser
 means somebody who was born in -- 
without a father. So a -- he was very bitte
r because he knew that he was born -- his 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
70
mother was not married to je -- to 
Joseph 
in this time. B u t as a human being, he was a 
wonderful human being. He wa
s very compassionate, as -- but so f -- and he was very 
religious. So to me that the Je
ws -- this what I try to -- wh
at the Jews gave to -- to the 
world, now take in -- in our 
time, the biggest doctors, the 
biggest thinkers, the biggest 
mu sicians, everything is Jewish, I am very pr
oud of it. I™m very pr
oud of our heritage 
during all the time of the relig
ion and their history. But I 
stop a little when it comes to 
God, I stop because I have questions, and I don
™t know if I believe in God, if I don™t 
believe in God. I don™t want to think about 
it, but if I believe, I™m very angry at Him. 
Because if -- like they say, if He rolled -- ru
ns the world, and if He rules everything, 
how -- where was He when  they  pushed in  4,00
0 people in a cha -- in a gas chamber in 
Auschwitz
, and the -- the crying and ev erything, He 
didn™t hear it. If He didn™t hear it, 
and He didn™t help, so probab
ly  He couldn™t help. And if He couldn™t help, well who -- 
who need s Him? So the -- but
 I -- but this isn™t -- but 
Esther 
is more religious that we 
are, because she doesn™t have this experien ce. She doesn™t ask God why didn™t He do 
this, why didn™t He th is, why didn™t He help 
my mother. So she is
 more religious, not 
the way religious she wi -- not to eat pork, 
she will eat pork. Not 
to drive on Saturday, 
she will drive Saturday. 
But, as a Jew, she is religious 
and I told her if she will have 
children, if the children will go  to a religious school I pay for it, and I do. For all the

three children, they go to 
Salo man Schachter
, I pay for it. So I am very, very proud 
what the Jews accomplished. 
Q: Did you talk to her about --about y
our war experience, about the Holo caust? 
A: I spoke to her about the Holocaust, but I 
-- I think -- this what my wife™s opinion is, 
that I -- I sp oiled a lot, because I started to ta
lk to her too early. I started to speak to her 
when she was small, and then
 sh e was so fed up that she 
tried to push it away. Even til 
today, there are organizations
 from second generations and 
this, and we told her to 
join, to be active, she is not
. And this what she said, because she was exposed too early 
to it. And then later, she tried to push it 
away. But I -- she know
s it from since  she was 
four or five years. And then
 later when I did with the gr
andchildren, she told me the 
same thing, not to try to  spo
il it, and not to try to influe
nce and talk so much about it 
when they are too small.  

Q: What -- how -- how did you tell it to he
r? Did you make it into some kind of 

bedtime stories -- 
A: No, no, I didn™t, not the bedtime stories. 
But I told her that -- 
th at I may -- about the 
five sisters I had, and about 
the children. Now there is -- 
there is -- in  the sign -- the 
new book I™m writing, there™
s some storie s comparing 
Esther
 with the -- with my 
sister -- sister™s children. S
ee, my sister™s children I lo
ve so much that -- like th ey 
would be my  children because we lived togeth
er. We lived together, we always -- we -

- especially  in the ghetto we 
were together. And the children 
[indecipherable] 
and 
they looked up to me. If I went out from the 
ghetto I took off my ba
nd there, and they 
looked up to me, and I always
 brought them one, wh
en  they didn™t have no -- an apple, 
they didn™t 
[indecipherable]
 or a plum or something wh en I came from a trip, or 
something, I smuggled it in and I gave it to
 them, so they waited for it. And -- and I 
was an -- the hero for them. 
Naturally in this time I was 
not in th e underg round, but 
still, I was the one that I -- th
at I brought them something, candy, a piece of chocolate, 
in the ghetto. But later, na
turally, they were -- and they
 were very young, like -- like 
one sister I had a girl come three and a 
half years and got killed, and one was two 
years. One -- the other sister had a boy th
ree and a half years and the other was two 
years. And then I had a nie
ce, and the niece was three y
ears younger than I. And my 
brother had the three children. One was 12, 
one was 10 and th e girl was eight when  
they were killed. But I was very, very a
ttached to the children, and -- and now it™s 
thinking back it™s like -- like 
I almost -- we all were very
 attached, the whole family, 
because we lived together and my father 
-- 
if I had a sister got married, he didn™t let 
them move away from our town
, they stayed in 
our town, he opened a business for the 
new son-in-law. Each daughter got -- he bo
ught them -- he gave them a dowry, and 
then later he bought them a house. He was 
well off, he could do it. But we were like --

like -- even when they
 married, th e -- there was no diffe
rence, they were like they 
would be home.  
Q: Let™s -- let™s go back to 
Esther
 for just a minute. Was -- she was an only child, and 
she also did not have any -- did she ask for grandparents -- 

A: She oh -- 
[tape break] 
Q: -- ask you th is again. Talk ab
out her missing grandparents, and -- 
A: Yeah, when she wa
s small she was very unhappy b ecause she always ask question, 
how come all her friends have
 grandparents, have aunts,
 and she doesn™t have. And 
came Sunday they came to vi
sit. So as a matter of fact, she had a friend across the 
street, and -- and they  -- she had tw o sets 
of grandparents. So she ask how come she 
has two gr -- sets, and I don™t have even one?
 So naturally we told
 her that they were 
killed, and where are they, th
ey are in heaven. 
So then later she mad e up with this 
friend that she said she should give her one se
t of grandparent. So  they said yes, we 

adopt you. And every time when 
they came over here, so she 
went to visit them, and -- 
and -- and she se -- but she knew that it is 
not grandparents, but she knew -- and they 
said we -- we will be your grandparents, and -- because 
Ellen
 has two sets, so you will 
have one. But she always was very unhappy th
at she doesn™t have grandparents. Then  
later she got older, so she realized then -- th
en -- in the beginning,
 when then en -- she 
was very small, so we told her where are th
ey. So we said they were killed, bad men

came and killed them. And -- and -- but then la
ter, naturally, when I told her about the 
-- about th e war, so ma ybe I told  her too ea
rlier, and she was like pushed away  because 
she le -- realized it when she 
was four or five, six years.
 It was a little too early. 
Q: I want to ask you another question that ha
s to do with your jobs again. So  later on 
you went into contru  -- into construction 
business, and you made
 good money, you had 
a successfu l firm. And then 
your family kind of liked 
you in a different way. 
A: No, no, they -- I didn™t say 
that they liked me, beca -- 
Q: No, no, I™m sorry. You -- y
ou to -- you just told me a story that they made you 
president of the family  circle -- 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: -- I just wondered whether you could say -- 
A: Yeah, well, no, because you see, in 
America 
the money talks. So they di -- I don™t 
think so they liked me more
, maybe some hated me mo re, because they were jealous. 
So they -- because -- and I give you other 
example, I had an unc
le and his son went 
here to college, and he hardly made a living. 
So they came to -- wh
en I moved in in the 
new apartment, and -- and I had new -- right 
away new furniture, so I told him, well, 
we try to fix it up, but we no
t finished yet. I purposely sa
id it. So she -- so I see she 
jump ed in th ere to her husba
nd, she says, ﬁSee, see? And my  son went to college and 

look at him. He just came over here, he has already a beautiful apartment, he has a

75
busin ess, and he is already 
fixed up.ﬂ Now, they were ve
ry, very, very jealous, but 
they said when they 
spoke to so mebody else, and they  said, ﬁOh
 No rma n
 is doing all 
right.ﬂ So they always said, ﬁOh yeah, we
 put him on his feet.ﬂ Which they didn™t do 
anything. And there are occasions that -- that 
-- what they did. Like for instance, I had 
one cousin, and they  -- he inherited from his fa
ther, he had a very big factory, and th ey 
made all kind of children™s underw ear. So -- a
nd I -- I was in this time in the remnant 
busin ess, so -- and he had s -- in the factory 
he sold remnants, so 
I went to him and I 
said to him, I buy remn ants. Now h -- and he 
sold it to a dealer, so
 he probably charge 
50 cents a pound, and later I bought it and I paid four dollars a pound. So  I said why 
can™t I buy direct? And he was a cousin , so he
 said, ﬁWell, I would sell it to you, but 
you have to bring me a st
atement from the bank. See,
 we do only business with 
somebody who could send me a fi
nancial statement. If you br
ing me the bank, that you 
have in th e bank 25,0 00 dollars, and 
[indecipherable]
 we will do business.ﬂ So I said, 
ﬁI don™t have 25,000 dollars.ﬂ So I had to
 buy his remn ants and pay instead a half a 
dollar, I had to pay four dollars. And I made 
a very small profit, which I could make a 
lot of profit. All right. Then  about 10 year
s later, when I was already selling furniture, 
I established my self, so this man opened a lo
t of -- a few  discount houses. So once I 
went in and I said to him, ﬁYou know, in th
is discount house you don™t have fu rniture. 
I™m -- I sell furni -- why don™t you give me a 
call and then I™ll bring 
in kitchen sets and

76
other things, we can make a lot of money, 
you will be a partner.ﬂ So -- and I will have 
-- and I could make a big business. So he 
said, ﬁYeah, well it™s a very good id ea, but 
you have to bring me that 
you have in the bank at l
east h u ndred thousand dollars, 
otherwise how could we do business with you?
ﬂ So I said to him,
 ﬁYou know what? In 
five years I will come back to
 you, because this way I w
ill make money. The first time 
you wanted 20, I didn™t have it.
 So now I have 20,
 you wanted hundred, I don™t have it. 
Maybe in five years we come
 -- I will come to you, you™
ll ask for a half a million 
dollars, but I already will have the hundred 
thousand dollars. So 
I will keep coming to 
you and I will raise my capital.ﬂ Naturally, 
he never let me have the furniture, and I 
never did it, and -- and it™s -- and this -- th
is how it was. Is a -- now there I have a 
other --  
Q: T-Tell me -- tell me the story though about
 the family  circle, because that™s also 
very telling. 

A: Oh, well the family circle, 
then when  I started to make a good living, and th en we 
had a family circle. Before n
obody wanted to know me, and 
[indecipherable]
 would -
- wanted to -- to have 
anything to do with me 
-- 
with it. Then la
ter, one -- one time 
when  we had a meeting, we had a meeting on
ce a month in a restaurant. They had to 
pick out a new president, so 
they picked me out fo r a pr
esident for -- for the family 
circle. And there were a -- a lot of people. An
d then to  make a president, so two people 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
77
came to me and they took me under the arm,
 they ca -- they we
nt with me to the 
podium, and then -- and they in troduce me, and 
I am the family circle. So in this time I 
brought my wife the furs -- mink stole. An
d mink stole was very fashionable, but in 
the beginning th is was very expensive, not 
everybody had it. So 
I took my wife™s mink 
stole and I spre -- and I spread it and I hold it,
 and I said to meet the new president of 
the family circle. They looked at me. So I sa
id, ﬁYeah, the mink stole is the president, 
but wouldn™t I be able to buy 
my  wife a mink stole, I would never be a president of the 
family circle.ﬂ So naturally they didn™t lik
e -- also they didn™t like it because a lot of 
times I said something 
what they didn™t like. So ab -- bu
t I didn™t care. So -- so I was -- 
I was a president for the -- fo
r the family circle. And -- 
Q: Let me -- let me ask you this because it 
-- it fits right now with what you so rt of 
said. When I ask you about the achievements
 -- I mean, you have had a long work life 
here, and you have bui
lt things. You have a family now
, you have built things. When I 
ask you what -- what do you consider the -- th
e achievements here, in
 this country, for 
you? 
A: Well, the achievements in this country, th
e first thing is that 
I had a daughter. This 
is the main -- th-this is 
the highlife -- the highlight, because wouldn™t I have a 
daughter, my  life wouldn™t be wo rth anythi
ng, because why did I surviv e? To have a 
continuation. The Jews lived 
for so many years, and I had 
to have a continuation. No w

she -- I have a daughter, she has three grandsons. So  it means that 
Hitler
 didn™t win 
the war. With me he didn™t win the war, beca
use his -- to win the war, it means to an -- 
an -- to destroy every single Jew, and with 
me he couldn™t do it. Now, we had a town 
very few -- only -- only four people surviv
ed ous -- from my town
. Now all the people 
when I look back -- when 
I look back and I -- there 
were families, the families 
stretched 300 years, nobody su
rvived. And then wh
en they killed the 
last one -- so it 
means they just destroyed ev erything. And with me, I didn™t. My  father had me, and I 

have 
Esther
, 
Esther
 has the children, and th e genera
tion goes on. I -- I™m very -- a 
little disappointed in  -- not disappointed, I f
eel bad that I don™t have a son, and the 
reason why, because by Jews, th
ere is a sect, and we call it 
kohanim. 
The 
ko hanim
 
descend from the priestly family
. Now this started, the first 
Cohen
 was 
Aaron
 -- a 
Cohen
, 
Moses
™ brother. This is a -- 4,000 years. 
And a son came after the father, after 
the father, and it was never change, because
 the Jews how -- not religious -- I mean, 
they were not religious, but this th
ey obeyed, that a 
son should be a 
Cohen
 after a 
father. Now this went on for 4,000 years til 
it came to me. Now, I don™t know how 
many forefathers were killed because they we
re Jews, probably a lot. My father was 
killed because I -- because he was a Jew. Bu
t I remained, and I took his place. Who 
knows, maybe his forefathers were
 killed by the Crusaders in the 
[indeciphera ble]
. 
We don™t know. So because it la
sted for so -- for 4,000 year
s, and it never -- the string, 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
79
the lineage was never cut 
off. And so not being a 
Cohen 
is cut off by me, because a 
daughter is not -- she herself is a 
Cohen, 
a daughter of a 
Cohen
, but her children are 
not any more. So this I am
 a little disappointed, becaus
e I would like this lineage 
should be long, and it 
should be til the end of time. Bu
t it isn™t, but I am happy. And 
they are -- they are th
e three boys, and -- and they shou
ld know that 
they are very 
proud to be Jews. And if -- if 
-- if one of them would marry 
out of religion, this will be 
the worst thing for me, I don™t know if I c
ould survive it. Not because era -- oh -- I bel 
-- I told you this before, not because abou t not being religious, 
but not being a Jew, 
because there was a man, there was a nation, they want a -- nea -- hel -- a -- destroy all 
the Jews, and I said no, I want to be aliv
e. And th rough me -- not only me, and others, 
said we are going around, we going a -- we are 
here, we establish a country, we in -- in 
America.
 We are Jews, and we did so much fo
r -- for the world, that I want the 
continuation should be. 

Q: Maybe that™s already enough, but if you 
have other things that you consider an 
achievement -- 
A: Well, this is a achievement
 about having a family. So no
w, also achievement is that 
I will leave a few books. And th is is very
 important for me because -- see, I don™t 
make money on the books, and I™m not interest
ed to make money. And if -- if -- if I 

get from wha -- book, I get some royalties or 
something, I send it to the mu -- to the 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
80
museum right away, because I 
don™t need it, I may -- I h a
ve enough. But to leave a 
heritage -- now, if I will leave my daughter, 
a other -- other thousan d dollars, or a other 
five thousand dollars, and I will leave her a b
ook, I much more in 
-- in -- I -- I™m much 
more happier. Why? Because the grandchild
ren will know, well my grandfather wrote 
a book, an d what do I write, I don™t write 
jokes, I don™t write -- I write something from 
the -- our survival. Like -- like if I woul
d have the book from my  grandfather who 

wrote about 
Jesus
, even -- I -- I -- I cannot imagin
e how he could have courage to 
write a book like this. But still he wrote it, he had -- he -- he went 
out and he -- he had 
guts to do it. So this is also 
that -- that my -- my
 s -- my -- what I di
d with the books is 
very important. And also that I am 
[indecipherable]
 my wife, and -- and my wife is -- 
I think we are -- we ra -- we are in
 love, e -- even we have frictions 
[indecipherable]
 
and -- and the frictions are because she doe
sn™t tie down the toot
hpaste like I w ant it 
should be down  because it™s 
loose. So we -- we have 
those kind of arguments. No t 
because it™s important things, but small thing 
[indeciphera ble]
 like -- like she likes, in 
winter for instance, I have a busy day be
cause the whole day she opens the window 
and I close the window. She wants a 
[indecipherable]
 minute I come in, I go out, the 
window™s open. I close it. So those are -- t
hose are the -- the -- the frictions. But as a 
whole, I think we agree on everything. We
 agree with the -- w
ith the -- with the 
grandchildren. We agree with our daughte
r, with -- mostly only small things that 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
81
otherwise -- and -- and this -- this is a achieve
ment, the achievement is that I am alive, 
that our generation, our herita
ge is alive, and I am giving -- I prepare a lot of things, 
the only worry I have is that they will not 
continue, or they will destroy it. Now, for 
instance, I told you before ab
out the stamps. I collected the 
stamps over 50 years, and I 
have the mo st beautiful collection. I don™t wa
nt to sell it, I don™t want to give it to a 
mu seum. I want my  grandchildren should have
 it, because it is -- the stamps gave me a 
lot of pleasure. I collected it, and it™s worth 
a lot of money if I sell it, and now I get 
nothing, practically for it. As
 a matter of fact, I told yo
u before, I bought today two 
albums. I said million times I wouldn™t buy 
any more, but it comes out something, I 
buy it. So this is a -- this is a very -- a ve
ry -- a pleasant thing, and -- and I -- I belong 
to a lot of organizations. Now I started to gi
ve up because a lot of 
times in the evening 
there are meetings in 
New York
, and -- and I don™t go. Even if I want to go, my wife 
doesn ™t let me go. So this is very rewa
rding, that I am getting acknowledged, I™m 
getting plaques, I™m invited to  speak. And life 
goes on. This wh at is inside me , nobody 
knows, because every night -- th
ere is not a night that I shouldn™t thi -- see, I am -- I 
am the 
United States
 almo st 50 years. 50, or mo re? ™
47? More than 50, yeah. I never 
dreamt about the 
United Sta tes
. Now, I went through, I have my life here and family. 
You always dream from your life. I never had that dream about the 
United States
. It 
doesn ™t mean that 
United States
 was bad for me, in the contrary. 
United Sta tes
 was 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
82
very good for me. Always 
when  I have a dream, it™s always a dream from home, 
before the war. Dream from 
the Holocaust, and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and I 
never -- I never -- and I™m thinking about life 
here. I never dreamt about it. Maybe this 
is the way it should be, that
 you don™t dream from -- from 
good things wh ere you are 
alive here, but you dream from be
fore. So th-th-the -- I live 
with the past, and this is 
very -- it™s not good, but I live 
with the past in, all right, 
luckily my wife is also  a 
survivor. Would I have an Am
erican survivor, probably we
 couldn™t live together -- I 
mean, with American person, because I don™
t think so that somebody would take it. 
But with  her, she has the same problem as 
I, when she dreams, sh
e dreams also about 
her family, about her ho -- ab
out her youth. And -- and this
 how we going on. I -- I -- I 
am very much interested lik
e I told you in the Temple, 
I™m not religious, but when it 
comes to the high holidays, I 
perform, and I -- I conduct services, I™m singing with the 
choir, I teach them. Because th
is is something that it™s in
 me, it™s a heritage, and I 
don™t want to let it go. 
Q: That was -- that was very important, 
yeah, you didn™t say that in the other 
interview. I™ve only two 
quick questions left -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and then maybe you can play a little music or so. 
A: Yeah, okay. 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
83
Q: I would like to ask you though, what did 
it mean for you to be in v -- wh en did you 
feel comfortable in 
America
, sort of , and -- and what did 
it mean to you to live in this 
country? What does it mean 
to you be an American? 
A: W-Well, to be in 
America
 is -- when I came over here
, I was very unhappy. And I 
was unhappy for a few reasons. I will give you an -- an article that it was just 
published. The first thing, I was very unhapp
y, I came to a country  -- see aft -- would I 
come straig ht from a concentration camp, I 
would be very happy 
because I would have 
to eat, I wouldn™t be chased. But I already 
went through a period after the liberation, til 
I escaped, I became already -- I had a chauffe
ur, my wife had a cook, and I have a 
bodyguard, and I was em -- a-and I was ad
mired, and I had a position, I don™t -- so 
then, after this, when you came down, 
it -- and I fell down so drastically to 
America
 
that I was nothing. What do you mean nothing?
 I di -- we didn™t know the language, I 
didn™t know the people, I didn™t have a trad
e, I didn™t have a job. And -- and it was not 
so -- this that you became -- you became worthl
ess. So in this time, for this reason, I 
wanted to go also to 
Israel
, but I figure 
Israel
 it will be -- a -- its -- was a dream, yeah. 
And -- and -- and in this time I con -- consid
ered to -- to commit 
suicide a few times, 
because I figured what -- why 
did I survive? What was -- we
ll, then later I started to 
make out all right, and -- and -- and I started 
to belong to organizations and I saw that 
America
 is giving me more than I ever dream
t, because I was not ex -- am -- nobody 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
84
called me Jew, no -- I was not beaten up, a
nd I could do anything
 I wanted. So I saw 
that 
America
 is -- and also, e -- I was -- I worked 
very hard, and I co -- saw -- then I 
bought a house and I could buy a ca
r, and -- and all those things, so til 
Esther
 was 
born I was satisfied, but it was mi ssing a child. No w, when 
Esther
 was born, so I think 
everything was comp leted. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
A: -- with regrets what I didn™t do, before 
-- I told you before the regrets. So you 
couldn™t go back, you couldn™t turn  back  
the clock, but I was very happy. So  
America
 
meant a awful lot t-to me. I ju
st wrote an article, I will g ive it to you, and I called it 
ﬁ
My Three Homelands
.ﬂ And I describe the three homelands, 
Poland
, amer -- 
Q: I™m sorry, could you say it again, there was a -- 
A: No -- 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You called it your three homelands. 

A: Yeah, ﬁ
My Three Homelands
,ﬂ and I describe it that three homelands, 
Poland
, for 
instance. 
Poland
 was like a stepmother, and I loved 
Poland
 and I wanted to be a 
patriot, but
 Poland
 didn™t let me love it. I wouldn™t 
-- I wanted to go to the army, and I 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
85
-- I couldn™t -- this before the war. And -- 
and -- because I thought we live in p -- in 
Poland
 -- Jews lived for thousand years, my fa
mily lived for 300 y
ears, and I thought 
for 300 years we could become citizens, but we
 didn™t. So then I describe -- I will give 
you this article -- then I de
scribe my  second homeland is 
America
. 
America
 to ok  me 
in, and nourished me, brought
 me back to health, and 
America  
did everything to -- for 
me that I n ever dreamt that 
America
 would do it for me, so I love 
America
, but my 
third homeland is
 Israel. 
It™s that my soul is in 
Israel
. Even if I live in 
America
 it 
doesn ™t mean -- I love 
America
, but 
Israel 
is my -- my real home, it™s that -- now, 
when I was the first time in 
Israe l, 
so we had an organization,
 and after the trip they 
ask me -- and I spoke about it, and so
 they  ask me who do you have in 
Israel
, why do 
you -- and I was so happy to  be there, even 
if I had there a brother. So I said, ﬁWell, I 
had an  awfu l lot of friends in 
Israel
 and I met all my friends. And I was -- I went 
home.ﬂ Who are the friends? So I 
told them my friends was the 
Rumbaum. 
Rumbaum
 is -- is a scholar from the Midd
le Ages, who is buried in the 
Tiberias. 
Maria Balanessa
, a other sage, who is buried in -- in -- in -- in -- in 
Tiberias
. There -- 
the founder of 
Kabbalah
, of my stic, was buried in 
Meron
, and so  on and so on. Those 
are my best friends. I lived -- I was brough t up with them. Then, the new generations 
that are my  friends is 
Theodor Her -- Herzl,
 the founder of 
Zi o n i s m
, and 
[indecipherable]
 who was a soldier and o
fficer who was killed in 
Israel 
in --in the

86
beginning. So you see, those 
people were my friends, and 
I went to visit th -- with 
them, because I lived with
 them. And then we had the patriarchs, in  -- in 
-- Abraham,
 
and a -- naturally they were not
 alive, but I went to them
. And then  I had my  ad opted 
mother. My adopted mother was
 Rach el 
in 
Bethlehem
. Every Jew knows that 
Rachel
 
was the adopted mo ther. So I went to there 
-- to them, and I spoke to th em, and this 
was my highlight for it -- so fo
r this reason my soul is in 
Israel
, my reality, my natural 
life is in 
America
. And my  dream was in 
Poland, 
but it was never continued because 
the Polish people didn™t let me
. Yeah, yeah, yeah
. So about -- th-thas -- I ge -- I --

Q: That™s very important -- 
A: You see -- you see, I™m -- 

Q: -- you did not say it that way -- see, th
at™s why it™s good so metimes to go back and 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you see -- you see 
America
 -- 
America
 naturally I have a lot of 
complaints to 
America
, but we are allowed to have co
mp laints, where I can speak up. 
I remember when I came to 
America
, I was very unhappy I to
ld you, because I didn™t 
make a living, and I wanted to commit suicid
e. Then later when I started to make a 

living, and when  I went to 
Florida
, and I -- and this I will never forget, and my wife

went to 
Miami
 to buy a pair of shoe
s, and we go in -- we went in in a store and I 
wanted to go to the bathroom
 and I see it™s written for wh
ites and blacks. I wanted to 
drin -- I couldn™t believe it, 
I couldn™t understand that in 
America
, so I went back and 
there was a full -- the store was full with people,
 and I started to yell, again I talk a lot, 
so I started yell don™t buy here shoes, I w
ouldn™t let you buy shoe
s. And she asked me 
why. I said go and you will s
ee. There are two fountains,
 two toilets, what do you 
mean this is for white and blacks? You can
not -- you cannot buy he
re. And I pulled her 
out and she didn™t buy the shoes, because 
for me it was something new. On the way 
home we stopped, I th-think, in 
No rth Ca ro lina
, something like that, and we went in a 
restaurant and with us was there a gi
rl, she was from -- a Jewish girl from 
Yemen
, she 
was dark. We were sitting by the table and 
we -- we ordered some food. So I made a 
joke, I made a joke and I said I hope they  
will not see -- recognize you who you are, 
because -- made believe that she is black
, you know? And the waitress heard it and 
two minutes later, the -- a manager came a
nd th-th-th -- he said you wa -- and they 
were -- they threw us out from the restaurant
 because we were with this girl. And sh e 
was Jewish. So when they thre
w us out, I didn™t want to go, then  they  called the police 

and we went out, and there 
were two police mo torcycles. 
And th ey ask where is your -
- where is your cars, I told them. They said
, you leave the town, we will escort you, 
and if you don™t go right away, we™ll arrest you. 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

Q: When  was that? 
A: This was in 19 -- in 1949. 19 four -- ™49 
or ™50, yeah , ™49. So  they  went behind us, 
we were out -- ou-out from the 
town, so they turn
ed back . And I described this in one 
of the vignettes. And this was a terrible th
ing for me. I co uldn™t
 understand how come 
that -- that -- that here in -- in 
America
 that I admire so mu
ch, and -- and there are 
people -- see, in this time
, for me, the-the-the-the -- wh
en they -- we called them 
Negroes in this time, that th
ey suffered and I could see th
em as I w as a second class 
citizen in 
Europe
. So this was very, very, very -- it 
-- it was terrible for me. I -- I -- I 
remember I had later, and thi -- I had later in -- in 
Hoboken
 houses, so I had houses 
and there one -- one house -- you see, all thos
e stories I have written down that will be 
in my -- in the book. Yeah
, so there was one man, he
 was the president from the 
NAACP
 in -- in -- in 
Hoboken, 
he didn™t pay me rent, I went for the rent, we had an 
argument, he beat me up. And -- and -- and I we
nt -- I want to go to
 police. So then I 
was in this time chairman from the 
ADL
, from, you know, Anti-Defamation League
 
from 
B™nai Brith
. So I told the stories, I said I wa
nt to make a case out of it because 
the 
ADL
 and the Jews they emancipated, in 
this time the blacks, they gave them 
lawyers to be -- they marched.
 So they made -- they made
 a complaint and I was called 
to -- to the headquarters from -- in  
New York 
from the 
NAACP
. So we were called to 
listen to the story and they called th
e man who was the president from their 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

89
organization in 
Ho bo ken
. So th-the story was that he took
 -- so I told them, he beat me 
up, I came for the rent. So he said, ﬁYes, 
I beat him up,ﬂ he was a big, husky guy, 
ﬁbecause he came in and h,ﬂ -- and I told hi
m, ﬁyou effing nigger, 
give me the money.ﬂ 
This -- this what he told them
, for this reason he beat me up.
 So I ask them, can -- can I 
ask him a few questions? Yeah, yes. I said, 
What kind of a house was it? Eight family 
house. Who lived in  the house? All eight 
were blacks. Wer -- what floor were you 
living? He say, on th e top floor. What tim
e of the day was it that I called you this 
name? It was eight, nine o™clock at night. 
No white people and I was there with my 
mechanic because we had to fix something. So
 I -- I -- I ask him those things, so I said 
to the people, I said, ﬁNow, do you think th
at if I will co me to his house, it™s a eight 
family house, all are blacks, he lives on th e 
top floor, nine o™clock at night, and I came 
in and I will tell him this what he said, and 
I will be alive, I will be here, huh?ﬂ So they 
asked then the -- my mechanic, he was Ukrainian, and he said, ﬁI ju st came in to fix 

something.ﬂ So they thought that
 he is lying, so on th e spot 
-- on the spot they said you 
don™t belong to the organization any mo re, 
you™re not a president and you -- we don™t 

believe you. And I -- so I was very, very pl
eased with their decision. And they were 
mostly -- they were about half Jewish la
wyers and half were blacks, because Jews 
gave them lawyers. So you see, th
ere was a lot of -- of things in 
America
 that I disap -
- disapproved, and -- and I liked . Like I disa
pproved wh at they did for black people, 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001

because I couldn™t believe that there should be
 a discrimination; after all, we are in 
America
. The same thing I didn™t want to be 
discriminated as a Jew. Well, those are 
the things that I have ev erything in
 the -- in the -- in
 the book, yeah. 
Q: Do you think the wo rld 
has learned from Holo caust? 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t think so . The wo rld has learned that our environment -- 
when -- when people who are in
volved  learn a -- Jews learned a lot, not so mu ch  about 
the Holocaust. Let™s say -- let™s talk about Jews in 
America
. The Jews in 
America
 are 
a little different now to what™s 
Isr ael
. They are closer to the 
Israel
 -- to 
Israel
 on 
account of the Holocaust, 
because they know that we -- would we have 
Israel
 before 
the war, probably more than half of Jews w ill be alive, because they will run out and 
they will have a place where to 
go. They didn™t know where to
 go. So now, this is like 
a insurance policy. A lot of Jews -- well, th
e young Jews I don™t think so , because they 
think we are in 
America
, 
America
 is mine. We have 
America
 in our pocket. And it™s 
not true. So -- but the other people, the el derly people, they figure well, this a 

insurance policy that in case
 something happens we have 
where to go. So the whole 
world didn™t learn anything, because as you can
 see, we have now not on the -- on th e 
so -- so strong as the Ho locaust, we had 
Rwanda
, we had
 Bo snia
, we had 
Cambodia
. 
So there are a lot of places that it was 
repeated. It was not so repeated like the 
Holocaust, like I said to you
 before. Why? Because it™s 
not done by the Germans. 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
91
Would the Germans be in those places, it wi
ll be done co mp letely. But those people 
were not capable to make it so comp lete as
 the Germans, becaus
e everything what the 
Germans did, it had to be perfect. So they  di
d perfect with the Holocaust also. So -- but 
they didn™t learn in case something ha
ppened it will be the same thing. Now, 
America
 
for instance, there are so many na
tionalities, but we know the time fo r 
McCarthy
, I 
don™t know if you rememb er this, it was almo
st. But, there were courageous people 
who stood up, and th ey started 
to bring this in the -- t-to 
the world and they  -- and he 
was thrown out. But as -- y-y -- also beca
use it was good times. God forbid if there 
will be bad times. They will look fo r a scapegoat. They  will look for a scapeg -- and 
here in 
America
, the first scapegoat will be the 
black. We have somebody who is 
behind us. And the next
 scapegoat will be a Jew. There is even a story that a Jew -- 
somebody said to a Jew that
 all -- all the disasters are on account of the Jews. 

Everything, all troubles are the Jews. So -- so
 then he said, well give me one example. 
So he said, take the 
Titanic. 
The 
Titanic
 si -- under the Jews. So he said what you 
bring the Jews, what have to do 
ya
-
ya
? He said, well the -- the -- the 
Titanic
 was 
destroyed by a iceberg. So he sa
id, this what I mean, iceberg, 
Greenberg, Goldberg
, 
they are all the same. S o  this 
is -- this is -- the man said 
it and he believed it. And there 
is -- and then a other man said about the -- 
about the Holocaust that
 all the trouble in 
the world, all the trouble in the wo rld are 
on account of the Jews, and account of 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz

92
bicycle riders. Every trouble what™s on the wo
rld are -- is guilty the Jew, or the bicycle 
riders. And people, when you tell it to them
, they look at you and they  ask, why 
bicycle riders? What have bicycle riders 
to do with the destru
ctions with this? 
Nobody™d ask why the Jews. N
obody said what do have th
e Jew -- in the country, if 
there is a disaster, the first scapegoat is th
e Jew. So nobody -- wh en you tell the story, 
and I tell the story to a lot of people, nob
ody ask yet, why the Jew. But everybody ask, 
why the bicycle rider? So there 
you have the answer, and if you ask -- if it co -- if the 
world learned a lesson, the world didn™t le
arn no lesson. The Jews
 learned a lesson. 
The Jews who su rvived learned a less
on. I don™t think that the Jews in 
America
 
learned a lesson. There are some Jews wh
o th -- know there was a H o locaust. But the 
majority Jew, what, they go to 
W-Wall 
Street, making money, coming home, going -- 
going to  -- to a nightclub, going to the movi
e. Do they think a
bout the Holocaust? No. 
The Holocaust was done
 for somebody else, and it was done
 in a other™s time, and it is 
not fo r them. 
Q: Very last question, and then
 I™d like you to  sing because -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, sa -- okay -- 
Q: -- I™m sure you still 
have some voice left. 
A: -- okay, yeah. 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
93
Q: In the later years, 70™s, 80™s, or s-s-s -- 
yeah, 90™s even, anythi
ng that happened in 
this country that was of importance to you, 
that you f -- that had impact on your life, 
that you thought was important
? Political, cultural, anything. 
A: Well, i-in this -- well, I told you, 
I™m not talking now ab
out personal things, 
because naturally persona
l things I improved. 
Q: Yes, I know. 

A: I improve them materially, and all those th
ings, but it -- it-- there were things that -- 
that is -- w ell, like for instan
ce, take now. Take now, I am
 very much -- I™m very much 
disappointed  in the results of the elections
. This is just happene
d yesterday. Now why 
am I memb  -- why am disappointed ? Because I know in 
America
, in such a 
democratic country, and I kn
ow that the elections were st-stolen, and -- and it™s not 
stolen, I -- there -- some lawyer was on tele
vision, he said it was not stolen, it was 
robbed. And it was robb
ed because we know -- now, if y
ou go to a bank,
 and you give 
them a hundred dollar bill, a
nd you said cha -- exchange it 
to me for wo -- single ca -- 
single bills for hundred. And 
you go away from the ta --
 from the window and you 
start to count, and you see it™s only 65 dolla
rs instead hundred . You will go back  and I 

say, you know you cheated me, you gave me 65.
 So what will he sa
y? He said let me 
count it over. And he will count over, he said
, he™s right. He will give him extra 35 
dollars. Now here, if it was wrong, if -- if 
it was right -- so why do they have to be 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
94
afraid it will be counted over? If it™s right
, so he™s right. But they  didn™t count it over 
because they knew it was wron
g. So this I am very mu
ch hurt. Forget about the 
democrats or republicans. If it will be the 
opposite, I will be hurt the same way. So a 
thing like this, I am very, very much di
sappointed. Disappoint
ed because I love 
America
, I love American democrats e-even if it™
s not hundred percent, but at least we 
can speak about it. In this, yo
u cannot even  speak. And th
en later the -- the -- the ca -- 
the Supreme Court in 
Washin gton
, they make the decision. The Supreme Court has -- 
i-is not created to make a decision about 
elections. The Supreme Court is made for -- 
to make decisions about something else. Yo
u see, be-because you ask me, those are 
the things that just happened
 yesterday. So a thing like th
is, I am disappointed  because 
I feel 
America
 is min e. It™s not a thing that I am living in a strange country, is a -- in a 
foreign country like I lived in 
Poland
. In
 Poland
 everything they  did, I had to take it 
for granted, this is the 
way it should be. But not in 
America
, this is my
 America. 
The 
same thingit™s your 
America
. Who are the Americans? We 
-- and this is -- and then 
there are -- there are a lot of places, a lot 
of where I c -- I coul
d give you a lot of 
instances that it is the same way I -- 
when I see injustice and it™s done in 
America
, I 
feel very bad, because I feel it is mine, 
and there shouldn™t any injustice. – M o stly 
songs that I sing -- course, it™ s 
a v ery popular song, because 
this is from my operetta, 
it™s made by 
Goldfarden. 
And the operetta™s name is 
Shilamis. Shilamis 
is -- was a 

 
Interview with NormanSalsitz  
 
February 9, 2001 
 

 
 
95
story about the ancient 
Israel
. And it™s a -- and there is a song is 
[speaks Hebrew 
here]
 means almonds in raisins. And you -- th
is is a lullaby. And my  daughter knew 
about it because I always sing it, she didn™t 
know what the words 
are. And -- and this 
they -- this they -- th
e song is about the Temple, and 
they described about the Temple, 
and they -- I always lo -- I love older -- ol-o
lder songs, but this 
is special with my 
daughter. 
[sings in Hebrew]
 There is a hymn of the Jewish partisans, you probably 
know about it. So I always, when I speak ab
out the Holocaust, I always sing this song 
of the Jewish partisans. Yo 
-- you -- you heard it, you know 
[sings] [phone rings]
 I 
always -- but this is English. This is always
 -- I sing this when -- when I just was in a 
place and I sing Yiddish  songs and there wa
s one woman, and she said, ﬁI™m -- I™m 
listening, but I don™t understand.ﬂ So I said, 
ﬁFor you, I have a b
eautiful Jewish song, 
but it™s in English.ﬂ So she was 
so glad, so I said this is, ﬁ
My Mother™s Sabbath 
Candles
,ﬂ did you ever hear it? It™s 
a beautiful song, I like it. Okay? 
[sings]
 ﬁMy 
mother™s Sabbath candles that make our home 
so bright, that faith
fully she light them 
with a prayer each Friday nigh
t. And then around the table,
 we gathered and we heard 
my  father chant a Kiddush, his heart is
 everywhere. Our humble home became a 
mansion in that mystic low. 
Our hearts filled again with hopes and dreams of long ago. 
Through all the tragic stories of
 Israel™s 
darkest nights, they 
never dimmed the glory 
of my mother™s Sabbath lights.ﬂ My mother™s
 Sabbath lights, I™m sure that all of you

reme mb er your mo ther™s Sabbath lights, a
nd if she was anything like my  mo ther, she 
used to do th is. First you put in a 
babushka
, a 
fichila, 
or a kerchief over her head and 
light the minimu m of two candles. And if y
our mother was as religious as mine, she 
also lit a candle, an extra candle for each ch
ild in the house. And 
even an extra candle 
on top, just for good luck. W
ith her hands, she covered her face, and made a traditional 
pray -- prayer, because this was the closest 
she ever got to God. ﬁAnd then around the 
table, we got it and we heard my father ch
ant the Kiddush, his heart is everywhere.ﬂ 
[sings in foreign language here]
. ﬁOur humb le home became
 a mansion in the te --

filled again with hopes and dr
eams of long ago. Through
