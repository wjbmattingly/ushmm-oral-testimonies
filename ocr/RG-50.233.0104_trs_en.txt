 LEXINGTON,MASSACHUSETTS
 
 
Dr . Prot , could you pleas e  tell me 
your name  and the date of your
 birt h and t h e pl ace  of bir t h.
 
 
Plea se don't  call me  Dr. Prot , my na me  is Jana. I t  
is my ni ckna me and my fu
ll name is Janina and 
my last na me is Prot.  
Oh, they don't work.  I wa
s bor n on Fe bruar y  8, 1926
 in Poland, in a small 
town na me d Nowe M i ast o, ne ar Wa rs aw.
 
 
Could you t ell me a bout  your c hil
dhood, what was it li ke growing 
up in your t o wn, a n d what  was  
your fa mil y like, di d you ha ve br
ot he rs and sister s?   What  di d 
you like  to do?   Anyt hi ng you c an  
re me mber a b out  that  ti me .
 
 
We ll I can reme mber plenty.  I gr
ew up mo stly in Wa rsaw.  But 
in my childhood
 I  changed my 
place of li vi ng because my par ent s 
wer e di vor ced, and part
 of my childhood I sp
ent with my father 
and part with my  mother. 
 I  have  a  br other  who is  t wo years  y
ounger  a nd for some  
time, before the 
war , we  wer e  se parat e d , beca use  he  wa s with  my  
mother, I was with my fath
er .  There  were ple nty 
of fa mily pr oble ms .  M y father  ha d so
me  ki nd of high positi on i n Pol and.
 
 
What  di d he do?
 
 
He  was a dir ector  of a bi g fac t or y 
of muniti ons a n d e xpl osi ve mat erial
s  in Pol and.  I was li ving wit h 
hi m near Radom i n a 
small town Pionki which was 
ne ar a big fa ctor y.  We  
lived in a big house with  
a bi g gar den.  I  di dn't go t o s chool .
 
 
You didn't?
 
 
 
No, i n Pionki was a s ma l l  countr y-
like elementary school , and my fath
er  di d not wa nt t o se nd me t o  
this  ki nd of school  beca use  th
e education wa s not too 
good.  So, I was taug
ht at home with two 
other  gir ls wit h a  pri va te tut or and we had les son
s at  home.  In the afte
rnoon I had to do my  
homework, as all  childr en.  Once
 a year I had to ta
ke some small exam, 
it  was a governme nt  
requi re me nt that  I ha ve e nough e duc
ation to start anot
her  clas s.  This  wa y I  practicall y  ne ver went  to  

school  except the last  year be fore the war, when 
we moved to Wa rsaw
 and I started w
ith they call in 
Pol and " G ymnasi um"--a  junior  hi gh.
 
 
Could you te ll me about  your  reli
gious  li fe in your  home , or re
s pecti ve homes wit h your pare nts?
 
 
Now we  have st arte d one  of t he  co
mp licated part s of my li fe.  My 
parents converted to Catholicis m 
before I was born.  Most  
o f  my  fa mil y wer e  co mple
tely, as they sa y, "assimilated"  fa mily.  They  
never feel  they ha ve  too 
much to do with Jewish 
habit s.  My father , I  t hink, wa s t he  bi ggest  Poli sh  
patriot that I ever met in
 my  life, and I think almo
st everybody on my  father's
 si de , pr obably i n  the  
20's, after the first war, converted 
t o Cat holi cis m or to Prote st antis m.
  N ot  in my  mo th er 's fa mil y.  
My mothe r  wa s, I  thi nk, onl y one .  So I gr e w up 
as  a Cat h olic girl.  M y parent s were not ver y  
religious in any religion bu
t official ly t hey were 
Ca tholic , and I  wa s brought up wi th ot he r chil dre n, 
so the y  want ed me  pr oba bl
y to be  the  sa me  as  the  ot her  gi rls. 
 I  was  bapti zed, an d I  went  to Firs t  
Co mmunion being, I think, 8 years ol
d.  I didn't know that
 I  a m J e wis h.  We  ne ver  ta lk about  it  a t  
home. I knew that we 
are a little different and it was hard fo
r me to figure out what is reall y  
di ffere nt.  I kne w that we are  di ffe
re nt t han the other pe opl
e.  My parents never 
went to the church. 
But if I wanted to go to the chur
ch wit h the  ot her girl s or i f  I wa
nte d to go t o the c hurc h wit h a  
serva nt , it  was per m
itt ed;  it wa s fine .  I r eall y disc over ed wh
o a m I  whe n t he war 
started and we al l  
disc ove red t hat  we  are  not  Pole s  a nymore, t ha t  
we  ar e Je ws  a nd  we  ar
e treat ed as Jews by  
ever ybody ar ound.
 
 
But  other wi s e, pe ople  di dn't  know, or t hey di d know?
 
 
Oh, yes , of c ours e, ever ybody kne w. 
 It was some kind of thing that 
tactful people don'
t talk about. 
We ar e li vi ng bet w een educated, 
intellectual people and many of 
t hem have what  they cal l i n  
Poland, mixed ma rriages. One of th
em was Jew, one of them was 
Pol e, a n d al most  e ve r ybody has  
some grandmother who is a 
Jew.  And pr
obably until late 30's Idon't know if my fa
ther really felt a 
big antise mitism.  I thin
k lat er  somet hing st ar ted, bec aus e  
I  re me mbe r  t hat  a bo ut  '38  or  th e 
begi nni ng of '3 9 he s t arte d to ta
l k that  he woul d li ke t o quit hi
s job, whic h wa s ve
ry well paid, and 
also I t hink he e njoye d 
what he wa s  doi ng. I  ne ve
r had a n opportunity t o 
as k hi m; I  was a c hild . 
And pers ona lly, I was  living 
i n some  kind of is ola t ed a r ea , I di dn
't go to school, I was living with 
my fat her be ing t aught at
 home .  It  was pr actic all y not e ven 
possible to be expo
sed to the Polish 
antise mitism.  I knew that it exis
ted; I knew it was so
mething really bad, 
but I never took it 
pers ona lly.  I gre w  up i n  very li be
ral house.  It was bad 
to be antisemitic, it 
was bad to think that 
blac k people  are  di ffere nt  and all people s hou
ld be equal.  You can
 imagine how it is.
 
 
Als o, I i magi ne you didn't  ha
ve  too ma ny bla ck pe ople.
 
 

No, no, but  t here  was  thi s  
ki nd of feeli ng in the  
house.  Pe ople  a r e e qual .
 
 
Ca n I  as k you more ab
out your  chi ldhood.  Do you
 re me mber if you ha d a ny 
interest or hobbies, or 
music , or t hi ngs  that yo
u purs ue d or e njoyed to do?
 
 
I don't think so. 
 I  was  a  very unhappy, s ociall y is olate d 
chil d.  I wa s unha ppy
 bec aus e  my pare nts  
were divorced.
 
 
How ol d wer e you whe n t hey were  di vorce d?
 
 
I was about 4 years  ol d.  
And t he y we re const antl y  
fi ghting t o have t he  chil dren.  M y fat her wa nte d  
to ha ve  bot h of us  and my mother
, of c ours e  want e d t o  have  bot h of
 us.  And we  were
 constantly for 
di fferent  reasons, swit ched from 
one  parent  t o  the other .  M y  mot h
er  was a very tense, ner vous, 
anxi ous, neurotic  pe rson.  I was  
muc h  more  ha ppy wit h my father. 
 B ut my  mo ther ,  whe n I  was  wit h  
her  for  vacation, was cons
tantly telling me , "How come  you ar
e  wit h your father, you shoul d be  
with your mother.  You ar
e  a  gir l, a n d chil dre n  s hould st ay wit h
 mother," and so 
on and so on.  I 
wa s reall y a very shy, un
happy and fr ustrat ed c hil d.  I wa s a 
very good student 
and I was reading 
books  fr om age  5.  I ha d ti me s I  
was reading two books pe
r day.  Everyone wa
s looking and saying, 
" What  s ort  of wonder ful  
child, rea ding and rea ding and rea ding."  
 No, it  was my escape--not t o  b e  
expose d t o t he fa mil y pr oble m, not t o pl ay wit h
 childr en where they coul
d as k me , where i s your 
mother?   I al wa ys  ha d ve ry st rong
 fee lings  t hat I  a m di fferent.  
It was  a ver y  di ffi cult  chil dhood.
 
 
Wa s t his  up t hrough your teena ger hood?
 
 
No, I  was a teenager  dur ing the war.
  I was also unhappy but  in a 
di ffere nt wa y.  The  war s t arte d 
wh en I wa s 13, and just befo re 
the war I moved to Warsaw, with
 my  b r ot her  t o  my  mot h er 's 
apart ment  and we stayed wit h her.
 
 
Ca n you te ll me  when you fo
und out you were Jewish?
 
 
I re me mb er  one  tal k wit h  a  maid .   
I  was proba bly 7 year s old, I  want ed
 to go with her 
to the church. 
My grandmother, my pat ernal gra ndmother , wa s livin
g with us when I was with
 my father.  I really  
didn't  li ke  her, s he  was  very vict
oria n, very ri gi d and sti ff and c o
nsta nt ly t r yi ng t o corre ct my  
behavior.  I remember te
lling the maid, "I know w
hy she doesn't want me 
to go to the church--
beca use  s he  is J ewish."   And I re
me mb er the  ma id l oo kin g ar oun d  an d 
di dn't know what t o sa y.  So 

I knew the r e  wa s s o met h ing a r oun
d.  I cannot cle arly tel l you wh
en I found out , pr obably I was  
about 12, but still 
the people didn't talk
 about it.  It was fu
ll denial.  Of course, 
immediately after the 
war , we  all  fi nd ou t wh o we  are .  Not h
ing mo re, nothing le
s s, but  the  Je ws...
 
 
After the war?
 
 
When t he war st arted.
 
 
Do you want to talk about that 
a lit tl e, where were you, what  wa
s going on, what  
di d you e nd up  
doi ng?  
 
 
War st arted, as you know, Sept ember 1, '39.  I  came from 
vacat ion, the last vacat
i on I spent wit h my  
fat her , to Warsaw.  The war star
te d a nd we move d from our  a part m
e nt which was on t he north part  
in Warsaw in Bielany to the huge apartment of my  
aunt who was a siste r of 
my fat her .  For a reason  
I was never  able to underst and, 
everybody had the feeling that it
 was more safe to be in the 
downt o wn Wa rsa w  tha n all  ar ound. 
 Li fe  showed that it wa s completely different .  And then it was 
the siege of the Warsaw.  We  stayed all time  with
 the apartment of my aunt
 and her husb
and and her 
daught er which wa s 10 years older at
 this time and also 
t heir  daught er-in- l aw be cause t he s on, my  
cousin was i n t he ar my, an officer 
i n the ar my.  So his wi fe was i n
 t his  bi g apart me nt a nd her  thr ee-
mont hs- old child.  It  wa s a  7 or
 8 room apartme nt in downtown  
Wa rsaw.   And Se ptember 25, it 
wa s the worst bombardme nt of Wa rsaw
.  And one of the first bomb  dr
op on t his hous e.  My c ousi n  
was killed at the pla
ce, wife of my cousin a
nd thre e- mont h- old baby wa s kil l ed a nd her mother  was  
killed.  Four people were kille
d, being about, I don't 
know, fi ve yards fr om
 me.  Soon the house 
collapsed and we  stayed in the ba se me nt of th
e coll apsed house.  We 
survi ved--my aunt, he r 
hus ba nd, my mothe r , my brot her , an
d mysel f .  The  fir st phas e of t h
e war  fini she d, Wa rsa w gave up,  
it was Se ptember 29 or 30, 
and we  went back to our 
apar t ment  on t he nort h pa
rt of the Wa rsaw.  It  
wa s not  badl y dest royed, no gl ass  i n t he  windows ,  bu
t  ot her wis e it  was  t he  s a me as  be for e.  Then we  
disc ove red t hat  we don't have any mo ney.  My fat h
er  dis appea red, we  kne w he  wa s i n  the  ar my, we  
did not know if he was 
killed or what has happen
ed.  And, also, I think 
my mother kne
w that the 
pres sure aga i nst J e ws ha d start ed. I t hink in Octo
ber or No vemb er of 1939, 
it was the order that the 
Jews had put the ar mband with the 
Star of t he David.  Of course 
we di dn't .  We are in complet e  
deni al t hat we are not, we are not
 Je ws, but  we knew that  we a r e. 
 And I think the landlords, owner 
of t he house where we were
 living, he probably knew
 it.  People knew of th
ese kinds of things.  So 
we  ar e hangi ng ar ound, not ha ving 
too mu ch money, even 
to buy bread. In No vemb
er '39, my father 
showed up from t he ar my.  He kne w
 ver y wel l  t h at he c oul d not st
a y i n Poland for ma ny reas ons. 
He  started imme diately to try to go
 through the green 
border, illegally, to Hung
ary.  Finally, he we nt 
to Hungary at t he end of December
 1939 a nd fr om Hungar y  t o Fra n
ce and from Fran
ce to England 
and I  ne ver sa w hi m again.  So th
e last time I sa
w hi m it  wa s for a br ief 
ti me i n Dec e mb er o r  

No vemb er 1939.  And we decided 
to move  fr om Wa rsaw to some  
ki nd of conve nt 
which was near 
Wa rsa w  an d my  mo the r  h a
d good frie nds  there . 
 
Could you tell me a little 
bit about this convent?
 
 
It was an interesting place.  Th
e convent  was of Franciscan Sister
s .  It  wa s or ganize d by Mot her  
Cza cka . The  congre gati o n was  quite 
liberal and plenty of people fr
om Catholic-Polish aristocracy 
fr om intellectual circles, they s
tick to this convent--it 
was what they call Fren
c h Cat holi cis m.  The  
Siste r s were  runni ng sc hools an
d works hops  for blind c hi l dren. 
 Mot her Czacka, the Mother  
Superi or, wa s bli nd herse l f.  Some  Je wis h i ntell ec
tuals were al so connected 
with this convent.  Two  
nuns  in hi gh posit ion we r e 
of Jewish origin--they converted.  My
 mother knew some of them before 
the war and wa s ver y fri endl y wi th 
them.  In De cember, 19
39, the y  invit ed us  to
 stay there.  They 
coul d not gi ve us s o mu ch a s a n a pa r t me nt , but 
I got  a room and my moth
er c oul d he lp with the  
garden, whic h s he  love d t o do and I 
ca n go to sc hool.  What eve r, I  do
n't think we  had 
a cl ear plan on  
what we  would be  doing. 
 I t hink ever yone hoped t hat
 the war wo uld be fi nished
 i n one  year .  So we  
would s urvi v e one  ye ar.  Nobody 
expected what r
eally happened.
 
So, in the very e nd of 1
939 we pack our belongin
gs with very fe w of ou
r fur nit ure, some bas i c  
things and moved to Lask
i , whic h wa s 10 
kilometers north of Wa rsaw
. We  stayed in a small 
apartment, my mother wa s working helping in the garden; or  sometimes in the kitche n whatever  
was needed.  My brother st ayed
 mostly home and for t he firs
t  year I was si mpl y helpi ng--I 
re me mber  working in the ki tchen or  in the wa shro
om or doing whate ver  ne
e ds  to be  done.  I  wa s  
bore d t o dea t h, it wa s not hing t o 
do, nothi ng to rea d, it wa s no peop
le in my age, 
I was not allowed  
to go, of course, to
 Wars aw or  any ot her  pl ace .  Proba bly here
 is the good place to
 say that I did not 
look li ke  a  Poli sh gir l.  I ha d ver y  black ha ir, 
bl ack eyes, rat her dar k sk
in and obviou
sly, it was 
difficult fo r me to walk on a Wars
a w st reet , not  being a ske d, " Hey, st op, you are Je wish? " or " Ar e 
you a Je w? "  M y br other  didn't  l ook li ke  a  Polis h c h
ild either with curly bl
ack hair, but he was not 
circumc i se d, and t his  wa y it  was  ea
si er to s a ve  hi m tha n 
it was to save me.  My mother, if we were 
talking how we looked--she look
ed wonder ful ,  she absolut ely 
di dn't l o ok J e wi
sh; nobody e ver 
suspect ed that she was Jewi sh.  Sh
e had a small, very prett y face, 
compl et ely grey hair  and she di d 
not have a ny proble m when s he wa s wal king ar ound.  The 
di ffic ult y was our docu ment s.  We  ke ep 
our name  Pr ot because it doesn't 
have any Polish, Jewish
 or  any othe r meani ng, but my mot her 's  
maiden name is Dajches.  She 
was Zosia Dajches.  So all our 
docume nt s wer e changed a nd my  
mo ther 's  mai den  n a me  w a s giv e n   
Kossouth
, what  is a typical  Hungaria
n na me and it  wa s given in 
this goal so that if 
some one wa s asking during the war, "Oh,
 you l ook s o me what stra nge , you l ook 
Je wish, you have s o blac k hair"   
I  wa s telli ng i m me diate l y, " Oh, ye
s, I ha ve blac k hair  be cause my  
grandmot her  was  Hungar ian, you k
now.  My mo ther's  name  is Ko ss
out h."   And the  doc ument s were  
cha nge d wit h t he hel p of the  nuns
, where we stayed and I  thi n k it  
were  ve r y good docume nts .  We  
had baptismal documents.  
It was filled out in
 church's  books, so it was 
possi ble to check that  it i s  
not false .  Some  pri ests  were a ble 
to do this if they wa
nte d t o fa lse t he r ecor ds i n c hurch books .  So, 
we  ha d not t oo ba d docume
nts  for  the  war.  Do yo
u wa nt t o know what 
happened to me later?
 
 

Ye s, i f you wa nt t o give this strai ght
 narrati ve  -- you were  in the c onvent ..
 
 
The n--I  a m in t he conve nt, it wa s about  1940.  All  
thi s year  we stayed t
oget her , my  mo ther ,  my  
brot her  and mysel f .  It  was very 
hard, it wa s ver y poor, it wa s not  
enough food.  We  di d not  ha ve  
enough clothes, but we  fe lt 
quite  sa fe .  In 1940, it  
was the feeling that the 
war  woul d not fini sh s o  
quic kly.  I  tr ied t o pre ss 
my  mo the r  v e ry ba dly  th at
 I woul d li ke t o go bac k
 t o s chool , and I be gge d 
her  to go ba c k t o Wars a w  be ca use  I  want  to go to 
school, to my  gymnasium an
d it  is  not  pos sibl e for 
me t o l ose s o muc h ti me .  M y mot he r  had  frie nds  in
 Warsaw and they agreed 
t o ta ke me and to st ay 
with their children and I would be  able to live with
 t he m a nd go to school . 
 I moved with them--I ' m 
sure they knew who am I.  
I a m quit e s ure .  Of c ours e, we  ne ver 
talk about it.  It 
was  some  ki nd of  
agreement  t hat it  would be co mplet e denial .  
They don't know I am Je
wi sh.  I have  all my  
doc uments, I am a Polish gi rl wi th a Polish na me , 
I am Catholic.  It was ve
ry helpful  t hat  I kne w 
Cat holi c reli gion ver y well and of 
course , all prayers.  It was no pr
oble m for me to go t o  the c hurc h  
and I  kne w how to beha ve  during the 
M ass .  It  was a  bi g hel p .  I  we nt
 to s chool  and 
it was difficult 
for the first year and then the next
 year, how it wa s?  It
 was about 1941 I stay
ed with these friends 
for  about  ha lf a  year  and the n  I  
was quite unhappy with 
thei r children.  It wa
s very cold, it was  
somewhat di rty and I was hungry 
all  the ti me and my mot her deci
ded that I am big enough--I was 
about 14 or 15--t hat I  could li ve 
alone.  She arr anged another place
, beca use no one  ha d mone y for  a  
room, but through some  fri
ends t hat  found an ol de r woma n who 
wanted to have some company and 
she rented me a bed in her room. 
 It was in Zoliborz, 
it was more cl ose  t o my school  and I sta ye d  
wit h her.   S h e was  a  nic e  wo ma n  
a nd I was  going t o s chool .  Re me mb
er, I had to cook
 for mysel f, I 
had to feed myself and it was absolutely nothing to
 eat.  I  was awfully, terri bl
y hungry all day long. 
I ha d onl y t his r atione d whi ch was  
possi ble  to buy.  Of 
cours e, you c oul d buy 
all kinds of things  
duri ng the war on the  bl a ck ma rket, 
but I  di dn't ha ve any 
mone y.  So, for  di nner  
I  cooke d s o me  ki nd  
of ka sha and I ate the pie
ce of bread for  breakfast, 
and this kasha that
 I cooked with 
water, I ate in 
the a ft ernoon.  I  re me mber being ve ry, ver y hungry
.  No w I  hav e  to
 move back a 
little bit. The  
ghett o was orga nize d much earlier , but it wa s more 
s out h fr om the part of
 the town where I was  
living, and I  avoid ver y mu
ch going to the downt own.
  I was living in the 
nort h part of Wars aw-
Bielany and later in Zoliborz.  
The  school  was  i n Zoli bor z, and 
I practically never go downtown 
beca use  it  was ver y uns a fe .  The  fe w ti me s t hat  I  
went, I saw the wall of the 
ghett o and the streetcar 
wa s going t h rough t he ghetto.  It 
wa s a bi g ghett o and a s ma ll ghett
o c onne cted by a woode n bridge.   
The  stre etcar  wa s going t hrough gh
ett o, not stoppi ng of c ours e.  A
nd I re me mber on one  of my trip s  
through the  ghett o, i t  wa s proba bly 
i n
 1941, I  t o ok t he str eet car  and 
then it was possi
ble to see the 
streets thr ough t he st reet car windows.  And then 
I saw dead people lying 
on t he stree t s.  Thi s I  
re me mber, dead boys 
a nd chil dren covered wit h ne ws pa per.  I 
didn't know what to
 do, I didn't know 
to look, or not to look, 
or  what  to do.  Thi s 
I  remember ver y cl early. 
 
 
Did people talk about wh en th
e  stre etc ar we nt t hrough t he gh
ett o?  No one said a word?
 
 

No .  Wi ndows were blocked in so
me towns. If you
 see the movie 
Europa, Europa
--I'm sure yo u 
did-- he 's l ooking through s o me kind of scrat ch. 
 If I remember correctly
, the wi ndows were not 
bloc ke d in t his st reetc ar  that I t ook, and shortl y 
after this it was some ch
ange in the relationship  
bet wee n big ghett o and s mall  ghett o.
  I think small ghet
t o wa s liqui date d and t he stree t c ar was  not  
goi ng a nymore through ghett o.  Onl y
 along t he wall t hat we see 
t he Por t  Brama-entr ance wit h  
Polish and German police.  
At this time, someti
me you ar e able to 
see Jews on t he st
reet going to do 
some work in the town.  Of cour se with German
 soldier or police with 
guns.  Some ti me s we sa w 
this  s mall  gr oup of Je ws  out  of 
the ghetto.  I thin
k it was  a bout  1941- 42.  Al so
, this was probably in 
1941, I  was  i nside  the ghetto onl
y once during the war.
  Should I tell you 
the st ory about what 
happe ned?
 
 
Ye s, ple a se .
 
 
I went downtown Warsaw with so
me  ot her  childr en of 
my fri ends who were hal f- Je wi sh and hal f-
Poli sh.  We  wer e  ver y s t
upi d.  We t ri ed t o  change  stre etcar  ne
ar t he ghetto wall  
which was the most 
danger ous pl ace, because 
the people hangi ng ar ound
 we call , i n Pol and, 
szmakownik
.  Do you know 
wh at  is  
szmakownik
?   Informers.  The 
people  who pi ck you up in t he  
street and "Oh, you are Jew, 
and give  us  mone y.  I f not , we  
are  goi ng t o  the  polic e."   So we  
st op t here on t he street , at t he  
streetcar stop near t he ghetto entr
anc e and, of c o urse , i mme diately 
they pick us.  My friend was a 
little older, I was about 14
 and she was, I think, 
16.  They took us to 
the police station at the 
entrance to t he ghetto, an
d i nsi de t he  ghett o to some  ki nd of, 
I reme mb er, big room
 and t hey st arted 
to a sk us  for  docume nts  and what
 we are doing. You are Jews an
d how come we ar e out of t he 
ghetto.  We are sitting 
and I keep telling them
, "We are not Jews, absolutely 
not. This is a mistake. 
Please let us go, it is a mistake."
  I do not know 
how, I a nd the ot her  girl , 
how we had the ner ve  to 
tell that.  In some mo ment it came 
t his, I rememb
er  ver y clearl y, some olde
r  ma n, a Je w wit h a  ba nd  
on his ar m, and he ca me  to me an
d a ske d me " Why you don't  have a 
ba nd? "   So I sai d , "I a m not  
Jewish;  t her e is no reason
 for me  to have a n a r mband."   Oh, 
how come , you are  Je wis h, it 's  e nough 
to look at you.  You ar
e Jewish and I don't understand, but if
 you will give me 
some money I can 
help you.  Do you ha ve parent s?   
I can call them where you 
are.  I can help you 
if you give me some  
money.  It  was clear  th
at he  wa s  worki ng wit h  the police a nd I l ook at  hi m and I t old hi m ve r y 
firmly, "I am not Je
wish and please go away an
d leave me  alon e."  He  we
nt  away,  and then the 
Poli sh police ma n ca me  a nd as ked me  about  doc ume n
ts .  I  di d not ha ve enou
gh because I don't have 
yet Kennkar te; t he Kennkarte was 
given wh en you were 
16.  I found a small 
piece  of pa per , fro m 
sch ool  wh at I was  att e n di n
g one year before the war.
 It was  a  Cat holi c sch
ool . I  s how hi m t his  a nd  
told hi m " D o you thi nk i f I woul d be  Je wis h, I woul
d be goi ng to Cat holi c  sc
hool be fore the war? " 
He  looked a t us  a nd he 
let us go.  He  pushed us
 through t h e e ntra nce  a nd 
we t ook the streetcar .  
Since then I knew very well
 I have to keep far away
 fr om this place.  In 
1942, I was still going to  
school  a nd wa s li ving wit h t his  
woma n but  I  st arted to have pr oble
ms at this time
.  I think the  
wo ma n did not know who I am, but 
I re member a fe
w ti me s they pi cked me on t he street, thi s  
Polish informer, they 
t ol d me  " oh, you ar e Je wis h, go wit h us ."
  Mostly I tried to tell them, "No I am 
not , go a w a y."  Beca us e  I kne w t hat  once I  woul d te
ll the m, "Yes", or if 
I woul d give  the m some  

mone y, it  woul d be  the e
nd.  And some  people , e ven
 in school, they
 asked me , some  girls they ask 
me , Why you look so Jewish and I alwa ys tell the 
story:  " Well, I  ha ve black hair  be caus e I a m  
Hungaria n desce nde nt."  But  it was , 
I don't  know how to tell you, it st
arted to be as 
I  was  consta ntl y, 
day a nd ni ght, t we nt y- four hour s on t h e st age .   Tha t
 I a m pla ying s o me body th
at  I a m not .  When i n  
this situation, somebody 
pi ck you up on the  s t reet fre que ntly
, the J e wis h people  bec a me ve ry 
confuse d. You c oul d s ee  fear on t hei r face s.  I  le ar
n not t o ha ve it on my fa
ce.  I learn when they 
pick me  up t o s mile  a
nd say," Ha, ha, how funny."   But  I  re me
mber  ps yc hologic ally
 I  was some what  
exhaust ed.  I t  was denial and de nial  a nd it  was  
no one with whom I  c oul d 
talk openly.  Absolutely 
nobody.  Be caus e  even
 it  was  some  fr iends  I  woul d be  wit h  
and I  kne w tha t  t hey
 know, but it was  
taboo.  We  never talk about it; 
never admit that they 
know; never talk abou
t this problem.  You  
mi ght t hink it is funny, but 
time to time when my mo
t her vis ited me , we neve
r talked about it!  It 
was denial  between my moth
er  and mysel f.  It  was so
mething that we 
ne ver, ne ver t a lk a bout.  M y  
mo ther  al wa ys t old me , r e me mbe r  y o u are  Hu nga ri
an, and I  kne w why s h e was sayi ng this , but it  
was impossible to say, "We'll talk about  it."  Talk 
about  wha t  has  ha ppene d t o 
t he r est  of t he family?  
Ne ver , neve r.  To make  things  
more complicat ed, at t h
is  ti me  my mo th er ha
d to move fr om this  
convent where she was st aying with my  brot her.  I 
thi nk it  wa s 1942, and one  
day they told her that  
there are some infor mer s te
lling the police that she is
 Jewish and that my  brot
her is a Jew, and they  
told them if they 
did not go away in a fe w hour
s, they will be taken to 
the police. So my mother 
took my br other, lea ving ever ythi
ng abs olute ly behind, I thi n k she 
took s o me cl othes wit h he r a nd 
as much mo ney as t hey had, as th
ey had not too much, of
 c o urse , a nd t he y went
 by fo ot to Warsaw 
and then I know fro
m her stories, she di
d not have any place 
to go.  She was walk
ing on the street in 
Wa rsa w , ke eping by ha nd t his  ver y 
Je wish-looki ng boy.  
She di d not ha ve a nyplac e to go, and it  
would be  curfe w  i n a fe
w hour s.  It wa s i n su
mmer, 1942, it became  th
e  eveni ng a n d you cannot  
stay on t he street .  It was so
me small hospital, in
 downt own Wa rsa w r un 
by nuns. My mother 
knocked to t he door of th
is small hospital. 
 The nun opened an
d  my  mot h er to ld  
the  nun, " Thi s boy 
is very sic k a nd he  ha s t o be i n t he hos pital right 
now. "  The nun, of course, 
did not  want  t o ta ke hi m 
and my mot her al most forced hers
el f int o--I t old you my 
mot her al ways l ooked
 very elegant--and 
told her, "I am very
 sorry, dear  nun, but he ha s a p pendiciti s a n
d has  to be operate d
 on now."  So  the 
nun did not  know what  t o do, but  
she op
ened the door and 
put  my brot her  t o t he  bed.  The  ne xt  day, 
I don't know if the doctor wa s s
eeing him or not. My mo
ther  left  hi m with th
e nun as a ver y si ck 
child in the bed, a nd we nt ar ound
 Warsaw t o fi nd a pla
ce where t hey can take 
hi m.  I  thi nk some  
fri ends  took hi m for  a  fe w days , a n
d then he was placed in an orph
anage wit h the chil dren of th e 
Poli sh offic ers  who per i she d  du
ring the war.  It wa s special or
ga niza tion hel ping this kind o f  
children name d R. G.  O., 
Rada Gt o'wna Opiekun'esa
.  They had some  hous
es where t hey t ook 
childr en who did not ha ve  fathe r s. 
 So my br other r e maine d i n t he 
orphanage, my mo
ther took a jo b 
as a hel per  of sick woman wi th ch
ildren, or a tutor of children, or
 a li ve -in ma id.  I  wa s goi ng t o  
school and living with th
is old wo ma n but quickly it 
started also to be impossi
bl e.  I t hink s o me body  
infor me d  he r , s he  sa id I c oul d no 
longer stay with her w
ithout  givi ng me  cl ear 
r eas on.  During t his  
time ,I think it was 
1942, some children from gh
ett o  wer e r unning t he  stre ets  of Warsa w  a nd be ggi ng  
for brea d.  You could see  the m
 on the  street  runni ng i n 
schmat tas
, very hungry mo st
ly without hair. 
The y  ha d some  ki nd of c ans  and 
they bang on these meta
l  ca ns ma king noi se 
and some , not all the 
people , are  t hrowi ng food to t he se ca ns.  It was  
i n winte r , 1941- 42.  The 
childr en wer e dyi ng fro m  
hunger .  When t he Ger mans see t h em, t hey shoot 
them si mply on the street .  In this apartment 

buil ding where  I  was  li ving wit h t his  woma n-- she
 wa s going to work and I wa s back from school 
about 3:00 in the afterno
on--it  was a child sleepi ng on t he stai
rs, wit h t his  big noi sy ca n.  He wa s  
banging on this c an a ski ng t he people to t hrow so
me  I thr o w so me  fo od,
 some br ead, and h e  
re me mber what  I di d and the ne xt da
y he showed again.  He
 wa s on my door, ba ngi
ng on this can.  I 
don't  know i f you c oul d underst an
d my s ituati on--how terri bl y dang
er ous  it wa s t o  ha ve a Je wis h  
child at the door.  I open 
the  door and I agai n t hr ow 
s o me food.  I r eally didn
't know what t o do.  I  
was dying that the neighbor
s will open the door and 
then it would be
 a horrible sit uati on for me.  He 
came again and then he
 came again.  But  I 
was in fe ar of this poor chil
d.  I never ha d this  ki nd of  
fe ar; I was sitting at home 
and almost praying to G
od not to send this chil
d anymore, because I did 
not know wh at to do; 
open the door or not open 
the  door .  At  thi s
 time me mother 
really didn't know 
wh at to  d o wit h me .   S u
mmer, 1942,  started, my  
mot her 's  fri ends found s o me  frie nds  near  Lowic z.  
It was an agr iculture scho
ol for  t he peasant  girls an
d they sent  me over  ther
e so I can help and work 
in the fields .  They agreed to ta
ke me.  That means that
 I woul d have  a  bed an
d food and then I can 
work.  And I  went  ther e kno
wi ng that I don't have anyplace to go
, nobody doesn't wa
nt t o ta ke me. 
I start ed t o work and I 
wa s terri bly unhappy, but  I 
was  unha ppy all t he ti me , 
it  was nothi ng ne w.  I  
was only one girl with da
rk hair between this Polis
h peasant ,  very si mpl e  gi
rls  sl eepi n g i n  these  bi g 
rooms wit h  more than t wenty beds
.  I had one bed between
 them and I was working in the fiel ds or 
taking care of cows , garden, or taki
ng out  weeds.  I  lear ned a lot .  
 The gir ls never  suspected that I  
coul d be  J e wis h.  The y  were  si
mple and it was too far from th
eir imagination. I was goi ng with 
them to the church and they were surprised that I 
have di ffer ent  hobbie s a nd di ffere nt cl othes .  The y  
aske d me  t h ous ands of naive  questi ons 
as what  for I a m 
reading books.  
 
 
Where  di d you get  books  at t his  ti me?
 
 
They ha d some  small 
library.  It  was very bori ng, as I knew 
al most  everyt hing, but
 you know, I still 
was reading in the evenings.  I think the director  
of the s chool , he proba b
ly knew very well who am 
I, but  they playe d t he y did not  
know.  It was again some  kind of
 denial .  I  ha d 
my  documents and 
this  ti me  I  had Kennka rt e.  As  yo
u c an see ,  it wa s general  agr ee ment  
t hat  I a m not  Je wish.  I  sta yed 
there quite a long time.
  I  didn't  go bac k t o  War sa w , I  did not  go
 back to school.  It
 was not possible .  
I was worki ng, I wa s ve ry e xha ust e
d, very lonely, there was absolutely nobody to talk.  I wa s still 
only 16.  I got hepatitis an
d I was very sick.  Of 
course, I was not seen by
 any physician.  I was  
lying i n  bed wit h high fe ver, a s  ye
llow as le mon.  After 
hepati tis, as  I  unde rstand 
now, but not at this 
time , I had very deep depression. 
 I was unable to do 
anything physically
 or mentally.  I was sitting 
in the corner of th
e room and I was even un able
 t o rea d.  I  wa s stari ng by
 window.  I did not want  
anyone to t alk t o me a nd I di
dn't  want to answer .  
It was for about thre
e or four we eks and 
ever ybody wa s s urpr i se d what is  goi
ng on.  The y think I a m
 goi ng cra zy.  Aft er t his ti me  I went  
bac k to wor k.  I was ve ry wea k and ever ybody 
wa s laughing because I 
cannot work too muc h. 
They told me I was lazy. 
 Beli eve me , I wa sn't laz y , I was sick. 
 But I was dr aggi ng my foot .  One of 
the girls i n s chool got t y phoid feve r and the y dec i ded 
I was the best person to 
take care of 
her.  They 
put us together in the small room. 
 I had always 
some kind of nurs
ing capability.  I was interested in  
me dici ne.  I wa s taking c are of her a nd s he wa s so 
si ck that they took her in the hospital and she 

died.  It wa s  Dec e mber 1942, yes 
it was Decemb er.  I re
me mber I wa s sti ll not ver y healthy and I  
we nt to bring water from the well.  It  was a very
 wi ndy da y and I ha d l ong
 hair  whi ch I c o mbed  
nicel y bac k  and put  the m toget her , 
but it was in the morn
ing and my  hair, I thin
k, wa s down and i t  
wa s wi nd y  and  my  hai r  was  wa vi
ng.  Suddenly 
the car with Germans ca
me to t h e school  for 
somet hing--t hey were comi ng freque
ntly.  I  was  a l wa ys  hi ding so mepl
ace when I  saw t h
at the car i s 
coming.  An d just as I was taking
 this water the car w
ith t he Ger mans came an
d t hey look a t  me and 
they i mmedi ately went  t o the dire
ctor of the school  and they aske
d  hi m wh at  thi s  Je wis h  gir l  i s  
doing here?  So  he said th
at I could not stay there an
y longer.  'You ha ve  t o go,
 you have to go now.'  
Some  way, I don't reme mber how, I informed my 
mother, I had my  mo ther
's address, I  don't 
re me mber.  It wa s possi ble to call , proba bly, I do
n't know.  My mother ca
me next wee k a nd she  
picked me up and it was the end of 
my sta y i n  thi s  sc hool .  I  went  
with her to Warsaw and I stayed 
with my  very good friend
s.  They were parents 
of my  friend from scho
ol, Sophia Kiel an, with  
whom I am still ve
ry friendly.  I was go
od friends  with both sisters,
 Zofia and Christina, and the 
pare nts  agr e ed t o t ake me 
to their home.  
It was just the beginning of 19
43, a nd I start e d a gai n t o go 
to sc hool.  I  tried t o cat c h all t hat t he y lear ne d 
during t he la st six mont hs. 
 For all my war ti me, it 
wa s proba bl y t he  be st ti me .  I  was  
tr eated as a t h ird daughter .  I  t h
ink they like me and I treat them 
as my  parents.  Of course, th
ey kne w  a nd I  kne w that  the y  kno
w.  I  ha d all  my pa pers , I  ha d 
doc ume nts, I  ha d my Ke nnkarte , I  ha
ve big beaut iful pict ure  of my 
fi rst communion. 
 It was very 
i mport ant  that I ha ve it.  I st
ayed with them 
until May 1943. 
 
 
Does that  mean afte
r ghetto uprising? 
 
 
Ye s.   The  ti me  wa s  ve ry  di
fficult for the Je ws. It wa s plenty of in
formers.  It was very difficult to be 
on the st reet .  Many times they 
st op me;  sti ll so
metimes I had to 
go to downtown Wa
rs aw.  I  ha d to 
prete nd tha t I was  a 'nor mal  pers on'; that I  a m m
ovi ng around a s e ver ybody 
else .  I di dn't me nti on 
be for e--but I ca nnot tal k a bout e ve rythi ng at 
the same time--I was in the Polish underground 
move me nt , from age 14 or 15.  I  
was involved wi th my  friends, Soph
ia and Christine Kielan.  I wa s 
in Pol ish undergr ound ar
my youth or gani zation, whi ch was  Szar
e Sz ere gi, gre y  tows .  We  had our  
meetings and we had some underg
round activities.  It 
was a danger, but for 
me it was also so me 
kind of pr ot ection.  I don't know
 if you understand why.  Un fo
rt una tel y, I  di d not onl y fea r  th e  
Germans, I fear, above all, the Po
l es.  The  Ger ma ns  were  not  danger ous  for me  directl y ; indire ctly, 
yes.  But directly it wa
s  t he  Poles ,  some body on t he  stre et, or
 ex-friends, or so
me one who knew wh o 
was my fat h er, or t hey st
opped me because t hey r
ecognized me, or some nei g
hbor s, or concier ge. 
Being in the Polish 
underground moveme nt crea
ted some  kind of protec
tion.  I am with Polish 
youth, I a m in the under g
round move ment  and c ann
ot be Je wis h.  We  had our  meeti ngs;  we ha d 
small di fferent tasks.  I rememb
er they gave me a Polish underg
round ne ws pa per ca ll ed Biul etyn 
Informacyjny.  They gave me  a bunch of them, I don't  know, twenty 
or more  and the y  as ke d me  t o  
deliver t o di ffe r ent  hous es.  It wa
s what t he young people 
wer e doing.  I di dn't
 want to take it; I 
didn't wa nt t o take it not beca use I di dn't want t o, 
but my da nger wa
s my fa ce.  I didn't wa nt beca us e  
if they pick me up with the un
derground material
s who knows what 
I will tell if th
ey will start to 
beat  me  up.  But  I  di dn't  wa nt to 
tell them that I didn't 
want to take it.
  Ever ybody will  be t hinking, 

why not?   Of c ourse , it wa s out of
 the questions to tell them--what
 wa s most si mpl y--" Look at me . 
Do you really want  me  to walk on the street  with 
this  ki nd of l ook wi th und
ergr ound material? "  So 
you ca n s ee it was c onsta nt str uggle
 how to avoid this kind of i nvo
lve me nt .   I re me mber  one  ot her  
scene. I was goi ng to
 school with my  friend, So
phia, and her mother gave 
us some smal
l lunch with  
us, pi ece  of brea d, we  ha d i n t he  
pocket.  We  wal k .  It was  not very
 far  fr o m t h e  ho me  and  t h ere  wa s  
a Jewish child sitting with a can, 
this completely 
emaciated child sitting with
 this can and banging, 
hal f dea d l ooking.  We  both t ook 
our lunch fr om our pock
et and throw away to 
his can.  This Polish  
woma n noti ced it  and s t arted t o 
run after us screaming 
"You dirty Jewi sh help
ers."  She was very 
angry that we gave this pi
ece of bread to t he Jewi sh 
child.  Now let's talk a
bout t he  J e wish uprisi ng. 
The  upri sing start ed just be for e Ea ste r.  I  thi nk it
 starte d on Thurs da y and from t he pl ace t hat  we  
wer e li ving- - it was fi fth fl oor , t he wi ndow fac ed to
 the s out h- -we  could s
ee the fla me s and eve n  
when it wa s quiet  at  ni ght,
 it was no s treet move ment, you ca n h
ear  pe opl e screa mi ng.  And t he n, of 
course, smoke, and consta
nt  guns s hot .  We  al l trie d not  t o 
go ne ar t he ghetto
.  It was very 
danger ous  at  this
 ti me s,  as  w a s  ma n y t i mes  
described.  And then I reme
mb er  a  fe w  day s  a fter  t h e 
ghett o upri si ng starte d, it  wa s East er brea kfast  in the 
house of our fr iends .  I 
think t hey have a har d 
time  with me too, 
because all  the relatives st
arted to tell them--why do
 you keep this str ange -  
looking girl; we are sure
 she is Je wi sh, a nd so 
on and so on.  
But  it was  a  bi g bre akfa st and t he  
relatives and friends were invite
d and we were si tting at the t abl
e a nd eati ng a nd t he windows are  
ope n and you c an se e t h e s moke a nd he
ar t he  guns.  It was 
hard for me t o take
 it.  It was some  
fe elings that  I am not in the right pl ac e, that probab
ly I should be over there,
 not here.  And some  of 
these people sitting in 
the room, I remember, sayi
ng, 'Good that th
e Germans are do
ing for us the 
dirty work.'  It is  a  poe m by 
Czestaw Mitosz, do you kn
ow Ca mpo dei Fi ori?  
As  I told you it wa s 
not good to go near  the gh
etto at t his  t i me , but  I went onc e or 
t wice and I re

tion and mat ura .  I  do not go
 into detail b
eca us e it  ha s not hi ng to do wit h  
my  personal story, Jewish
 st ory.  Gymnasi u m was  not  e xisti ng 
duri ng t he  war and we  ha d what  t he y  
call komplet y.  It was an undergr
ound sc hool a nd we  mo
ve from one house  to 
anothe r a nd t eac hers  
wer e  c o mi ng and t his  wa y I  fini sh
ed gymnasi u m, wit h s m
all groups of ot her gi
rls  and i n M ay, 1943 
we ha d to t a ke mat ura , hi gh s c hool
 di ploma exa m.  Both my fri ends 
went  to underground unive rsity  
which was also active during the wa
r in Warsaw, and I decided to go 
to t h e s chool  for  nurs es .  At 
this time I knew that
 I  want  to be a phys
i cian.  So I  de cide d to go to s c
hool  for nurses.  It was a very 
good sc hool  in War sa w.  It  was  
run by a wo ma n, Mrs. Roma nows
ki;  I  re me mb er  her.   A nd  s h e 
deci ded to t a ke me eve n t hough 
I was  below the  a ge.  You ha ve to
 be  17 t o be  admi tte d and I was  
sixtee n a nd a hal f.  She  agree d  to
 take  me  as a student.  We  were  working in the hospital in the 

morning and in the afternoon we  ha
d l essons .  It  was a dor mi tor y on 
the last  fl oor;  one  r oom for  four  
girls and we were able to live ther
e-- a lso very poor food, but a t  leas
t it was something to eat.  This 
way I was all set, I can tell,
 because I  was abl e  to st
ay there.  Also it was 
sa fer bec aus e  I  had a  nurse 
uni for m with some kind of 
a white hat and I feel that
 I did not look s o di ffere nt in t his .  M y hai r wa s  
pulle d back;  my uni for m wa s all  whit
e and I  was always careful to be 
extr emely cl ean and i n  or der .  
You know it  was ver y i m porta nt not t o l ook negl e cte
d.  What wa s very str ang
e, the di r ectress of t h e 
school , I thi nk, she  kne w  very we
ll who am I.  I thin
k some  people  ca lle d her  a nd a s k her  t o take  
me.  At first  she agreed t o t ake
 me even though
 I was below the age.  A
nd se cond, eve ry ne w pupil 
has some  kind of task to do in sc
hool .  For i nst ance, k
eep t he bathr ooms cl ean 
or  kee p  t he  cor r idors  
clean or  cl ean t he t abl e af
ter breakfast.  They gave
 me a chapel.  I  was in 
char ge of chapel .  What  
wa s not so very e asy
 bec ause  I had to get up 
very early, 5:30 i n the mo
rni n g, and cl ean the chapel  
and put t he flowers and t hen help 
the priest with Mass.  After Mass
, you don't know 
this because it 
is completely different now, th
e prie st wa s  going t o  gi ve  Comm
union to the si ck peopl e in the 
hos pital .   And I was  the  on
e going before the priest
 with a  ca ndl e a nd a  s mal l bell  ma king noi se  a nd  
to s how hi m who wante d to ha
ve Co mmunion.  That was my  
task for  every 
day morning. 
 
 
Where  was  your  mot her  a t  thi s ti me?
 
 
My mothe r  wa s wor king for s o me pe ople  with pr obl
e ms .  I re me mber , i n one
 hous e, t he woma n had 
cancer and she had small  chi ldren 
an d  my  mot her  wa s hel pin g.   S h
e ne ver  had a ny s pec ifi c proble m 
as a Jewish woman.  We 
ha d als o other proble ms:  we didn't  
have a ny mone y, we di dn't have an  
apart me nt .  My brot her  staye d i n
 t he  orpha nage.  He had pr oble ms
 because he looked too dark; he 
had curl y, da rk hair.  At  t his ti
me , I t h ink he kne w that he wa s not 
c ircumc i sed and he  kne w that he  
can prove he is not Jewish
.  I stayed in th
e nurses' school un
til 1944, when it st
arts the Warsaw 
uprising.  I was still
 in the Polish underground 
movement and still
 had to take so
me orders fr o m 
them--we were sol diers.  So, wh
en Wa rsaw uprising  st arted I ha
d t o go to my 
unit; I wa s two 
mont hs  in t h e ar my.  I  was use f ul  
a ft er one  year 's  nursi ng s chool .  I  
was  with a par a me dics  group;  i t  
wa s four or fi ve girls  in this 
group.  We  stayed tw
o months t oget her , bei ng al most ki lled ma ny,  
many times, but at this time, at 
least, I was no di fferent
 than the other people;
 we  wer e  all fi ghti ng  
wit h Ger ma ns.   B ut it  was not  als o
 so easy, I  remember  
when the Polish soldiers
 fro m uprisi ng were 
leavi ng Star e Miast o a nd goi ng t hrough s e wera ge  an
d the y ar e  taki ng t he m  in the ni ght  through the  
ope nings i n the str eet .  One of the  girls tol d me 
later that when they we
r e taki ng her out-- she  ha d  
very bl ack hair li ke I  had but  I don't t hink s he  wa
s Jewish--one of the people
 he lpi ng her  sai d, " Wh y  
should we  help you, you 
are Jewish", and pushed 
her  a way.  Of cours e ot her  pe opl e s aid, " N o, no, 
she is with us."  But mo stly at 
this time it was not 
important how do 
you look, everyda
y we  could be 
killed, not once, but many 
times.  The uprising fini
shed in end of Septem
ber 1944, and we were 
take n to a ca mp, t o Pr usz kow.  It
 was a bi g camp and most of the 
people  were ta ke n to Ger ma n y. 
We  went wit h my frie nd Sophi a a nd her mot her fr om
 Warsaw to Pruszkow.  
Then we were taken to  
the  trai n; t he  trai n was  going ver y sl owl y  thr ough 
the station and we  jumped
 fr om t h e trai n.  The 
train was open, they didn't have 
a roof, if some body he
lped you, you could ju
mp  over.  Then I  
stayed with them in their friend's house.  I was ve
ry si ck, I ha d pne u moni a. 
 We all had louse, we  

wer e very dirty, pr oba bl y not ea ting for ma ny da
ys .  Eve n I  don't re me
mber, I think I was not 
compl etel y conscious.  The peopl
e wer e very nice, t hey
 ga ve us baths and clea n cl othe s.  Our  
clothes were  onl y t o be burne d; t he y  wer e s o di
rt y a nd l ouse- infest ed.  I  
have some  ki nd of foggy  
me mory of this place.  I stayed through Oc tober,
 1944, and in Nove mbe r, 
my  mot he r  fi nd  th at I 
survi ve d, and she survi v ed 
a nd my brothe r sur vi v ed.  They were 
in a completely other part of the  
town; we did not  know about eac h ot
her for  more t han thr ee mo nths . 
 My mother came
 and she took 
me away t o some bi g ho
use for  di spl aced persons from War saw, 
near  Krakov.  It  was terribl y dirt y  
place  a nd we were  happy i f  we ha d one  s ma ll be d 
for t w o pe ople .  Ever ybo
dy sleeps two people on 
one  be d, or if it wa s worse, th
r ee pe ople  on t he  bed.  We  were
 very hungr y, ther e wa s a  s mal l 
a mount of food a nd the  peopl e were
 very unpleas a nt for  us .  And on 
the end of November, I we nt to 
Krakov myself and I 
found myself a job in a small chronic 
hospital  for old and dis pla c ed pe opl e. 
They were very short with any help and they took 
me i mmedi ately when I  to
l d  the m I  fi nis hed one  
year of nursi ng school .  I t  was the most terr ible 
place that I ever wor ked, but
 at least I  was abl e to 
survive.  I was living in a small room with anot he
r  woma n a nd they ga ve  us  some  food t wic e a  da y,  
and we kne w t he war woul d fi nish 
s oon.  And war fini she d for us, 
in January 1945. 
 I wa s working 
over  there  for t wo months.
 
 
Who liberated you?
 
 
The  Soviet s, of c our se.  The  war  
fi ni she d and i m me diate l y when t h
e  university ope ne d i n Krakov, I  
wa nte d t o  go t o  Me dical  School  i n Kra kov, I  was not
 admitted.  They told me  that  I di dn't  finish 
high s chool .  I  ha d some s ma ll pr
oof of my  final exams but they sa
id it was not eno
ugh.  In fall, 
1945, I  moved from Kra kov wi
t h  my mot her  a nd my brot her  t o Nt oc
taw--Breslau in Si
lesia.  It was  
an easy t o wn for some r eason--it 
was easy to have an apart me nt.  
The town was destroyed, but still 
there  were  s o me good hous es.  Th
e  Ger ma ns  we re s e nt  to  Ge r ma ny  
a s dis place d per sons.  And we  
got  so me nice apartment and I was admitted to me
dical  sc hool  and my brot
her went  to gymnasi u m 
and my mot her got a j ob as a li br
arian in t he Pol y techni
cal School in Nt
octaw.  So we started so me  
kind of nor mal  li fe.  We were  very
 poor, of course.  My mo ther's
 salar y  wa s ver y
 low and it was 
difficult for us to live.  
I  had s o me  str ange j obs  du
ring my year s at  
me dical  school , tr ying t o ma ke  a  
little money.  My father was help
ing a little--my father was in E
ngland sending some parcels, 
so meti me s wit h fo od an d so me ti me s  wit h s o meth ing w h
at we coul d s e ll.  And 
t his wa y we s urvi ve d  
and I fi nishe d me dical sc hool a nd I  
stayed in Poland.  I 
was married, I ha d childr en and I le ft Pol and 
in 1971.
 
 
I want  to tha nk you ver y mu
ch for your ve
ry ca ndi d... 
 
 
But I think I should add, 
I al most  feel  obligated t o  add what  
ha s happe ned t o othe r me mbers  of my  
fa mi l y .  Th e fa mi l y  
on my father's side, they mostly conver
te d be for e t he war an
d nobody, or a l most  
nobody went to ghetto.  Th
ey stayed on the Polish 
si de  and t hey had a very di ffic ult  ti me .  The y  

were we althy and if you ha
d mo ney, of course it wa s 
easier  to survive.  But, also, you were unde r 
constant attention of informers th
at are coming to the house and telli
ng, " We ll, give us  s o me  mone y, 
you Jew, give us some m
oney.  If not we will go to
 the Gestapo and the polic
e."  We were so poor 
and it was so obvi ous  that  we don'
t  ha ve any mone y t hat t he  infor mer
s  di d not pay much attenti on to  
us bec aus e we  were  not  attrac tive  for the m.  So one
 of my a unts  al wa ys  sa
id we survived the war 
beca use you wer e too poor to be of
 i ntere st for a nybody.
  And, some of them survived and some of 
them they were given by 
informers to police and Ge
sta po a n d t hey wer e  kill
ed .  In  my  mo th er 's 
fa mily, almost ev
eryone was killed.
  They never converted, they 
were Jewish a
nd everybody knew 
they were Jewish.  They 
never changed their name--t
heir name was Dajches a
nd they all perished in  
Ausc hwitz.  I gat her ed all  the  na mes  for Ya d 
Va she m.  It was  more t ha n t we nty peopl e. 
 
 
I 'm s orr y t o hear  that .  Is  ther e a nyt hi ng else  you 
wo uld like to add, any ep
isodes you di
dn't recount 
to me , or anything else you wo uld 
li ke to s ay to me  at thi s poi nt?
 
 
I think only that it can be 
said much better than 
I did.  I try to keep on fa ct
s.  I think, ba
sically, t hat 's 
all.  Thank you.
