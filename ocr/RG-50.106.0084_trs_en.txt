GEORGE PICK 
November 13, 1997 
 
Question: This is the 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
George Pick
, conducted by 
Gail Schwartz
 on Novemb er 13
th
, 1997 in 
Arlington
,
 
Virginia
. This interview is part of the muse
um™s project to interview Holocaust 
survivors and witnesses who are also volunt
eers with the museum. This is tape 
number one, side 
A
. Could you give us your full name? 
Answer: My name is 
George Steven Pick
, 
p-i-c-k
. 
Q: Is that the name you were born with? 
A: The first name is A nglic
ized. The original name was 
György
, but I changed it 
when I became a citizen
 because nobody could 
spell it and pronounce it. 
George
 is 
an equivalent E
nglish version of 
György
, which was my name. 
Q: And your family name was 
Pick
? 
A: My family name was 
Pick
, correct. 
Q: And where were you born, and when were you born? 

A: Yes, I was born in  
Budapest
,
 Hungary
, in  March 28, 1934.  
Q: Now let™s talk a little bit about your 
family. Ho w long had they  been in th at 
area? 

A: My family™s history had been quite
 intertwined with the Austro-Hungarian 
empire™s history. I have records wh
ich shows that my family was in 
Hungary
 for at 
least 250 years. I have actual birth certif
icates and Œ and other do Œ documents

which document this. And I ha
d a very large family. I did 
a little bit of genealogical 
research. It showed that I had roughly 25
0  family  me mb ers in  
the empire. And I am 
saying this because when the empire broke up
 after this first World War, my family 
sort of stayed to Œ stayed in the geogr
aphical locations they were, but all of a 
sudden they were citizens of
 three different countries, 
Czechoslovakia
, 
Hungary 
and 
Austria
. And some of my relatives also lived in 
Transylvania
, so they became 
Romanian. And this was the 
situation between the two 
wars. We were a fairly 
closely knit family. People were keeping in  
touch with each other. And I know, for 
example, of what my great-grandparent
s did. One was on my father™s side, a 
physician. And the other one 
on my father™s side was a merchant, an importer, who 
imported mostly fruits and spices. My gran
d Œ great-grandparents on my  mo ther™s 
side, one owned a lumb eryard, and the s
econd one was a lawyer. And so I have 
quite a bit of Œ of information about th
em. My grandparents of Œ my  maternal 
grandfather was an engineer, a mechanical 
engineer. Worked as chief engineer of a 
Œ of a factory in 
Hu nga r y
, and my  grandmother wa
s a housewife. My other 
grandfather was a director of a lumber comp
any. My  father was a Œ an engineer and 
my mother was a paralegal secretary. So that ™s the background. I am  an only child, I 

had no brothers or sist
ers. I have a number of cousins, I have a Œ 
Q: What are your parents™ names?

A: My father™s original name was 
Istvan
, which is transl
ated roughly to 
Stev en
, 
an d  my  moth er™s n ame  was 
Margit
, which is 
Margaret
; that™s what she Anglicized 
her name to when she 
came to this country. 
Q: And her maiden name? 
A: Her maiden name was 
Ko rnha user
, and that™s her father™s name. Her mother™s 
maid en  n ame was 
Spitze r
(ph). And my  grandmother on my  father™s side, her 
maid en  n ame was 
Augenfeld
(ph). 
Q: And you said your father was an
 engineer, what kind of engineer? 
A: He was a Œ a mechanical engineer, a
nd he worked for a 
short time as such. 
Because of some of the Jewish laws, whic
h came into effect in the late 30s, early 
40s, he lo st his job in January  of 1939. 

Q: Yeah, we-we™ll get to that in a mo ment
, yeah. All right, you are born, you said, 
in 1934. Did Œ was your family living in
 the center of the city, or whereabouts? 
A: Well, my family lived in 
Buda
, which is the other side of the Œ the 
Da nube 
river, and we lived there until I think I was 
about six or seven, 
and then we moved 
to 
Pest
, my father, mother and I. 
Q: Do you have 
any  memo ries o f  
Buda
, living in 
Buda
? 
A: Yes, 
Buda
 is a very Œ very nice hilly secti
on of the city. We lived near a Œ a 
large square, where Œ and a Œ and a hill, 
Gellért
 hill. And my mother took me, when  

 
Interview with George Pick

I was a child, walking ther
e to both the Œ the hill and the square. And I Œ I do 
remember very well the Œ th-the area. 
Q: Was this a Jewish neighborhood? 
A: No, it was not. There was a Jewish neig hborhood in 
Pest
, but not in 
Buda
. A n d  
we did Œ we were very Œ we 
were not very religious. We we
re fairly Œ we Œ we were 
really Œ 
Q: Assimilated? 
A: Yeah, assimilated, I could say. And were
 not very co nscious of Œ of living in a 
Jewish neighborhood, although we Œ we
 know that we are Jews, of course. 
Q: Did your fami ly have any 
kind of religious observance? 

A: I th Œ we Œ we observed 
the high holidays, but that was 
about it. My father™s side 
of the family had a number of people who 
were Œ who married non-Jews, and they 
were, I would say, comp letely non-observan
t of any religion. A few of them had 
converted before the war, but most of 
them stayed Jewish, but were Œ were 
completely secular, I w ould say. 
Q: Do you think you knew 
you were Jewish by th e time you were six Œ up to th e 
time you were six? 
A: It™s an interesting story. When I was about four or five years old, my  mo ther 
took me to a little gymnasium. The gymnasi um, in an English sense, was in a 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997

Jewish high school, and we went there 
once a week. And the teacher was Jewish, 
and it was a little bit of a physical educatio
n type thing. And on the corner, just 
across the street from this high school, 
there was a Œ a Catholic church. And I 
always insisted that we should go into th
is church, because I liked the way people 
were Œ were praying there. My mother 
didn™t say anything, a
nd we went there. 
However, on Œ by ag e six, my  mo ther enrolle
d me into a Jewish elementary school, 
and by th en I knew very well that I was Jewi
sh. I was also sort of forced into the 
reality of being Jewish after my father lost
 his job and he told me that he lost it 
because we were Jews. 

Q: What language did you speak at home? 
A: Well, we spoke German, mo stly my  mo th
er and father and gran dparents. I would 
say they did, I didn™t. And they  spoke it 
because they didn™t want me to understand 
certain things. I was taught German when 
I was in kindergarten, and I spoke fairly 
well for a few years, but then I™ve comple tely forgotten it. Hungarian was the main 

language, essentially. 
Q: Was your father, or your 
parents in any way Zionists? 
A: They were not. They were not Zionists 
at all. There was a Œ I had an uncle who 
came to the 
United States
 in the late 30s and he first wanted us to co me, and sent 
papers. This was in 1940. 
Hungary 
was a neutral country until June of ™41, so

people could theoretically at least, 
leave the country. My uncle, who was a 
physician when  he emigrated, brought 
Œ took our papers and sent us some 
affidavits, but my father was very reluctant.
 He Œ he didn™t want
 to start again, and 
the un Œ my uncle was fairly discouraging 
as far as the possibilities of employment, 
because on Œ he was telling my father that 
he would be sort of a tradesman, maybe a 
mechanic. Well, my father was an engineer
 and a businessman and he didn™t want 
to step down the ladder, so
 we didn™t do anything. Th
en in 1940, he
 offered my 
mo ther that he would adopt me, and that he would take me, but my  mo ther declined 

that offer. So, because of
 that, I got stuck in 
Hungary
 with my  parents, of course. 
Q: When  was the first time that you rememb er hearing the name
 Hitler
? Granted, 
you were very young in th
e 30s. Do you have any me
mories up til 1939 of your 
parents talking about this man, or wh
at was happening, how conditions were 
changing? 
A: I have very vivid memo ries in 1938 of 
Hitler
, because 
Hitler
 sp eeches were 
broadcast in the radio, and I rememb er th
is frightening voice,
 and Œ and his yelling 
and screaming, and Œ 

Q: And you were only four and a half. 
A: Correct, but I remember it very vividl
y because it was frightening me. I mean, I 
didn™t understand the language, but the wa
y he spoke was Œ was very frighten ing.

Q: Did you say anything to  your parents,
 or do you rememb er them comforting 
you? 
A: I don™t remember them comforting me, I th
ink I Œ I said to my parents that Œ that 
this man was a very frightening pers
on, the way he spoke. And we had 
[coughing]
 
excuse me Œ we had a prime minister atthe time who was also a great anti-Semite, 
and I rememb er Œ well, I don™t rememb er the Œ the speeches, but I do rememb er the 

kinds of Œ of expressions he 
Œ he Œ he used , which again, were Œ were frightening to 
me, although I was only a youngster. I was 
a fairly precocious child and I was well 
aware of some of the politic Œ political figures, 
Churchill
,
 Roosev elt
, 
Hitler
 an d all 
this. And in fact, it was a sort of a joke in
 th e family that people always ask me, you 
know, who was the Prime Minister of 
England
, or who was the president of 
America
, or whatever else, and I always kn
ew the answer, even when I was in 
kindergarten. So I was sort of regarded as
 a smart kid, and I Œ I was mo re aware, 
probably, than an av
erage four or five years old, about wh at was happening. 
Q: Okay , let™s move now to 1939. Is that 
the year you said  your father lost his job? 
A: Yeah. In main of Œ May of ™3 9, when
 th e second Jewish law came into effect, 
my father lost his job, but it was more than
 that, because that particular law, also 
allowed what they called 
people who were not trustw
orthy fo r the govern ment. 
They allowed the government 
to induct them into labo r brigades. And of course, 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
10
these groups included communists and Jews
. And because of that, a number of my  
uncles, and among them, my  father as well,
 was impacted very
 sh ortly. Actually, 
1940, my father was induct
ed into a labor brigade.
 And they took him to 
Carpathia-Ruthenia
, which at that time was already occupied by 
Hungary
. And 
they sent him to bu
ild roads, strategic 
roads in that area. 
Q: When  did you say he was taken away? 
A: This Œ this was in Œ in 
September of 1940, 1940. And Œ 
Q: What did he do between the time he 
lost his job, and being taken away? 
A: Okay, between the time he
 lost his job and being taken away, many Jews figured 
a way to go around th e Œ the laws. Accord
ing to the laws, which were designed to 
squeeze the Jews out of the economic life of 
Hungary
, a Jew could not practice 
busin ess. But wh at they did, wh at the Jews
 did is they hired a Christian person who 
would th en take out the business license, 
and they would work  under him. And in  
our build ing wh ere we lived, there was a super by name of 
George Dudek
(ph) who 
was a very kind man. He was a friend of 
my f-father™s, and he volunteer Œ he Œ he 
essentially agreed with my fa
ther that he would take ou
t the license, and of course 
my  father paid him a stipend, and under th
is Œ with this arrangement, my father was 
able to Œ to do th at Œ some business. Now,
 when I talk about business, it was not a f 
Œ it was not a formal store. What Œ what 
they have done, and this is a fairly 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
11
interesting story, is they Œ they went to
 coffeehouses, and they
 met there Jews and 
non-Jews and th ey made busi
ness essentially on a handshake 
[indecipherable]
 and 
they sold them both things. My father, be
ing an engineer was more familiar with 
engineering materials, so he Œ he sold 
scrap iron, scrap materials and bought Œ 
bought them as well. And he had some pa
rtners who were Œ a
nd business partners 
who were both Ch ristian and Jew, and that
™s how he essentially made a living. And 
bet Œ and after ™39, he has done that fo
r Œ for quite awhile. As you see, he came 
back after the 1940 inducti
on, and then he was inducted
 another time. But between 
1939 and 1944, he was home mo st of th
e time, and when he was home, he was 
doing th is, he was practicing business. 
Q: When you were very young, di
d you have non-Jewish friends? 
A: I did. I remember o n e, I don™t remember h is name. M y  grandparents had a little 
home Œ a little home, a little yard and a Œ 
a small bungalow, about 20 miles from 
Budapest
, which we used, as well as some 
of my other relatives for summer Œ a 
summer cottage. And I remember in 1940 pa
rticularly in the summer of ™40, we 
went there. My mother and 
I stayed there for maybe a 
month, and my  father came 
out on the weekends and we ha
d some Œ I had some next door neighbors, little mini-
farms, and kids came over, peasan t childre
n, and the Œ we played . And there was 
absolutely no talk abou
t wh ether you were Jewish or you
 were not, they were just 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
12
friends. And Œ and as I said, I had a num
ber of them from that Œ it was a little 
village called 
Gerdaler
(ph) and we had a ne
xt door neighbor, was a Serbian couple, 
and we were very friendly w
ith them, and some others, 
also. The building we lived 
in in 
Pest
 had a few children. In fact, our next 
door neig hbor had 
two girls, and the 
next door neighbor was a professional sold ie
r. He was a Œ a Œ an officer in the army. 
And I was extremely friendly with their kids
. I was Œ if I wasn™t home, I was there, 
and they sort of regarded me as Œ as a 
family member. W h en 
there was Christmas, 
they had a little gift for me under the Ch
ristmas tree. And I have a number of 
pictures with the Œ with the two girls. 
One was my  age, and the other was a couple 
of years younger. The next neig hbor next do
or was also very fri
endly. They Œ they 
had a Œ a girl who was my  age as well. 
And the three girls and myself, we were 
almost inseparable friends in the age four
 to seven or eight,
 even up to 10. And 
again, there was very little, to me, was ve
ry little awareness of Œ of what™s the 
difference between a Jew and a non-Jew. 
Q: So you™re saying you di
dn™t experience any anti-Sem
itic remarks at that time, 
during th at interval? 
A: I Œ I wouldn™t say that. What I was sa
ying is that I did ha
ve non-Jewish friends. 
We had a number of anti-Semites in the bu
ilding. And th ere was one incident which 

I reme mb er very vividly. There was a teacher, who was a Œ quite an anti-Semite and 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
13
he disliked me and I disliked him also, a
nd once he asked me something, and I sort 
of a smart-alecky answ er and he gave me 
a big slap on the face. And I Œ that was 
the first time I have ever ha
-had Œ even my parents didn™t
 do things like that to me, 
and I was very upset. And the interesting end 
of this story was that a couple of years 
Œ couple of days later, this fellow came ove
r and apologized to me that he did this, 
that he shouldn™t have. But I know that his 
feelings were not very  friendly. But he Œ 
Q: Do you think that™s 
because you were Jewish? 
A: I am almost positive that that was 
the case, that because I was Jewish. 
Q: How do you know th at? 

A: Well, I think he was a member of some 
sort of a Hungarian Nazi party. An d he 
was certainly Œ he was the warden, the air ra
id warden there, and he was very gung-
ho on Œ on the war. This was 
the first year of the wa
r, when this whole thing 
happened , in 1941, and I know that he was Œ he was nationalist at least. But I Œ I Œ I 

always had the feeling that 
he was also an anti-Semite. 
Q: What was it like for you as 
a young child to have
 your father tell 
you that he lost 
his job, his work , because he was Jewish
? Do you rememb er what your reaction 
was at the time? 
A: Well, I Œ I don™t Œ I don™t rememb er 
what my reactio n was, but I remember 
when he lost his job. I do not recall whet
her it was a panic time or not. But he has 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
14
lost his job many times during the Œ the de
pression, and he always found something 
to do, and somehow to make
 a living. He was a man who could make a living on a Œ 
in 
Antarctica
 probably as well. He was a very ingenious person. 
Q: So you don™t remember feelin g particul
arly threatened in 1939 because you were 
Jewish? 
A: I did not feel threate n ed economically, but
 as I said, I  had this Œ I mean, I heard 
Hitler
 and I heard the prime minister of 
Hungary
 speak and yell. I certainly was 
frightened  by th is. Maybe I was not comp lete
ly conscious as to what could happen. 

But just the Œ the voices were disturbing. 

Q: What kind of relationship 
did you have with your pare
nts? Was it a very close 
one, did you feel you 
could talk to them? 

A: My relationship with  my  parents at th
is time was clo se to
 my mother and not 
very close to my father. My father was a fa irly  cold person. He was not a kind of a 

person who would Œ would colo r, or who 
would tell me that he loves me, or 
something. And he was not a 
kind of a person who 
would want to take me to places. 
There was always a great disagreement betw
een my mother and father as to how to 
bra Œ how to bring me up. My  father felt that my  mo ther was coddling me too 
mu ch. He called it a monkey  love, and he wa
nted to make a man out of me, and he 
felt that I w as just too soft. And over the years,
 this Œ this translated into a Œ a fairly 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
15
distant relationship betw een my self and my  
father. Even later in my  years, I Œ he 
felt that I Œ I just did not meet his expect
ations in terms of physical prowess. My 
family, particularly my fath
er™s family had a number of
 gymnastic champions and Œ 
and great sportsmen. My unc
le was an Olympic Œ he was a European champion of 
gymnastics and seven times Hungarian cham
pion. And both my  aunt and my  uncle 
on my father™s side w ere attending the 
Los Angeles 
Olympics. My uncle also went 
to the 
Amsterdam
 Olympics and 
Stockh olm
 Olympics as a Œ as a part of the 
Olympic team of 
Hungary
. And with that, of course, w
ith that kind of competition, 
no, I was Œ was not able to comp ete. My 
father was, in his younger days, pretty 
physically active. In his 40s he was not as 
active as he was earlier. But he expected 
me to follow his footsteps and his brother™s
 footstep, who was a Œ a great skier and 
mountain climber, and I was never able to fu
lfill these kind of things, so he sort of 
gave up on me on that. 

Q: Now you said that your family
 moved away. Was it in 1939, from 
Buda
 to  
Pest
. 
Why did they move? 

A: If I remember correctly, in 
Buda
 they lived with my
 mo th er Œ  matern al 
grandparents. This was right after they got 
married, and they rea
lly could not afford 
to live apart. In the late 
30s, they had improved the financial conditions wh ere my  
father beg Œ was wo rking fo r 
a couple of years there, and I guess they were able to 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
16
afford to move away. Th
ey  didn™t want to move into  a very expensive 
neighborhood, first they moved into a Œ 
a fairly low Œ middle class neighborhood. 
But then later, in 1940, me Œ we move
d into an upper class place in Œ in 
Buda  Œ  
in 
Pest
, in Œ which at that point was 
sort of considered a suburbs. 
Q: And when did you start school? 
A: I started school in September of 1940, an
d I went to a Jewish elementary school. 
It™s called the Jewish Boys™ Orphanage, but 
it was not just an orphanage, it was an 
elementary school for other children. An
d it wasn™t even for boys only, it was a 
coed school. So we had about 30 stude
nts, I guess 20 boys and 10 girls.  
Q: Why did you go to a Jewish school? 

A: Well, there were several reasons for that
. One of it is that 
school was considered 
very good, and at that point I think my  pa
rents became aware that
 I should be more 
aware of my  Œ my  Jewishness. And so they  decided that this was a Œ a good school 
for me. And indeed it was. I had met child
ren, both girls and boys, who were Œ 
essentially who became lifelong friends. In f
act, I still have a number of them here 
in this country, whom I known since age si
x from first elementary school. And so it 
was a Œ a Œ a great bond, as it turned out. We had a great teacher 
Arn
(ph) 
Magda
(ph) who was a Œ a young woman at the time. And I rememb er the school as 
a very friendly school, and as a very friendl
y place to Œ to go to. I also rememb er 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
17
that my mother took me ev
ery ni Œ every day. The school was about a half an hour 
walking distance from where li Œ where we
 lived. And I always woke up late. 
Actually, my mother didn™t ha
ve the heart to wake me up
 early enough, so that we 
ended up running all the time. And Œ and she Œ I rememb er very well that she 
always had my  Œ hand my  Œ he
ld my  hand, and we ran thr
ough this city park to get 
to the school. And I also rememb er the other teachers, other than just 
Arn
(ph) 
Magda
(ph). 
Q: In the early 40s, did you Œ or even in
 late 30s, did you notice any refugees from 
other countries coming to 
Budapest
? Jews from 
Germany
, 
Poland
, 
Austria
? 
A: Yes. Actually, they were some of my
 relatives who were able Œ there was one 
uncle, his name was 
Gustie Œ Gustav
. He lived in 
Vienna
, and after the 
anschluss
 
he was arrested, and they took him to 
Dachau
. And for Œ and I am not sure and I 
don™t rememb er how, but after 
about a year and a half in 
Dachau
, he was let go, 
and he managed to slip
 over the border to 
Hungary
, and became an illegal alien . 
And I remember him very well. He Œ we us
ed to have a family gathering in my 
matern Œ paternal grandmot
her™s and grandfather™s hou
se. They had a little house, 
and it was a family tradition that we got 
together every Sunday afternoon. My 
cousins, my  aunts, uncles and ourselves. And I rememb er Uncle 
Gustie
 came at that 
time and he was telling us stories about the cam

believe him very much. He was a very ni
ce man. I didn™t realize it until after the 
war that he was a multimillionaire who at th
e end did not survive,
 and who left all 
his houses for nobody. Ma Œ on my  mo the
r™s side, there were several great-aunts 
and ch ildren and Œ who lived in  
Bratislava
. And I remember 
Ileanor
(ph) and her Œ 
her 16 year old boy 
Ga rbo r e
(ph) and her husband, they we
re able to slip across the 
Danube 
in 1942. And they 
lived again as illegal refugees in 
Hungary
. We, between 
1942 and 1944 were able to hide them. It will Œ this fo
llows, we had a fairly large 
family in 
Budapest
. They Œ every night 
they slept somewhere 
else. And so every 
week or week and a half, we were the 
ones who were hiding them, and my  mo th er 
and grandmother were particularly fairly 
nervous wh en th
ey slept in our house. Had 
Œ they had some papers, but 
they were not very good.  
Q: Was this nervousness conta-contagious? 
You were eight and nine years old wh en 
this was going on, and if so
, how did it manifest itself? 
A: Nervousness was contagious in a sense th
at I was aware that these people were Œ 
were illegals, that they came out of ho
rrible things. We knew about the ghetto. 
Q: How did you know? 

A: Well, they were telling us about the ghe
tto, they were there, and the Œ and that 
people went into hiding, into forests, and 
also the Œ th at they were di Œ taken aw ay. 
Q: All this was believed? 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
19
A: All this was not believed very  mu ch. We 
Œ we didn™t think th ey were lying, but 
we certainly didn™t think th at it could ha
ppen to us. And so, although we were 
nervous about their status, and we obviousl
y were family, and we helped them as 
much. There was, for example, one uncle wh
o Œ who was a very ni
ce guy. He was Œ 
his name was 
Louie
, and he was a very religious Ca
tholic al Œ although he was not 
born Cath olic, he was a Jew who converted. 
And he was a great fa
mily man, and he 
was the one who got false papers to thes
e people. Somebody Œ and I do not know 
who and why and how, betrayed him, and he
 went to jail for six months, because he 
not only helped the relatives, he helped othe
r people in getting false papers. At that 
time, there were approxim
ately 10,000 Po lish and che Œ Czechoslovakian Jews 
living illegally in ha Œ in 
Hungary
. 
Hungary 
at that time was reg arded as some sort 
of a haven, a safe haven for Œ fo r Jews. Again, the Hungarian government sort of 
knew about their existence a
nd tolerated them, but that they were still illegal and 

they had very little possibilitie
s of Œ of doing a
nything. They couldn™t work, they 
were essentially charity cases 
for the Œ for their families.  
Q: In 1942 and 1943, did you 
notice any rise in anti-Semitic
 
incidents on the street, 
or to you personally? 
A: Yes. The Œ in 1943, there was an intere
sting in cident, which really brought home 
the frightening reality. My father was Œ as 
I mentioned,my fath
er was inducted in

1940 to 
Carpathia-Ru thenia
 working on strategic roads. He was let go three 
months later, and in 1943, he was induct
ed again. This time he was taken to 
Kluge
, 
Transylvania
. 
Ko loszvár
, wh ich is a Œ was again, part
 of the occupied territories 
by 
Hungary
. He was doing some roadwork there 
as well. We visited him, because 
we had some relatives who lived there, in 
Kluge
, and we the Œ I remember very 
well that he was quite lucky, because his commander was a decent man. His name 
was 
Andoor
(ph)
 Alto i
(ph), and he was a very humane person. He recognized this 
whole thing as being really ludicrous. And 
they Œ the Œ the men were able to, for 
example, organize groups. Some of them
 we Œ mo re well-to-do men paid money 
into a fund to get furloughs,
 and that money went to th
e families of the destitute. 
And the Œ the man who ran, 
Altoi
(ph) who ran this Œ this brigade, this labor brigade 
allowed this to happen, and he did not allo
w the lower, non-com officers to Œ to hit 
the Jews or Œ or Œ or do an
y kind of inhumane things. So in
 that respect, my father 
was quite lucky in that. After he was deac tivated, which was in

Q: Let™s back up. What™s it lik
e for a nine year old to see his father in a Œ you know, 
taken away and having to
 do th is kind of wo rk? 
A: Well, we had a family tradition, we neve
r went to Œ to the railroad station. We 
always said goodbye at home. And it was a 
very traumatic experience, of course, he

Œ I rememb er his rucksack, his Œ his thing,
 he carried his thin
gs with him and he 
bought good shoes and things. And it was 
Œ we were always terribly distraught, 
because of course, we never knew how long 
my father would be taken, or if we 
would ev er see him again. It never Œ it™
s sad, you know, you ar
e inducted, and you 
have to go to such and su
ch a place within 48 hours. 
But we never knew what his 
destination was. And then, of course, when
 we heard from him, when he was taken 
to a Œ to 
Transy lvania
, it took roughly a mo nth befo
re we knew where he was.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum 
interview of 
George Pick
. This is tape number one, side
 B
, and you were talking 
about wh en you would say good
bye to your father at the 
railroad station. And then 
you had also mentioned Œ when  he was 
taken away Œ and then you had also 
mentioned that you and your mo ther came 
to  visit him one time, an d I was just 
asking what it was like for a young boy to
 see his father in that position. 
A: Yes, as I mentioned to y
ou, our Œ our family tradition 
was that we were not Œ we 
Œ we never went to the railroad station, 
we said goodbye at home and then he went 
to the railroad station himself. I Œ I like to 
step back in time, in 1942, because it was 
very important and a very traumatic one. In
 April of ™42, when 50,000 Hungarian 

 
Interview with George Pick

22
Jewish slave laborer servicemen were induc
ted, men between the ag es of 18 and 40 
were inducted and they were taken to 
Ukraine
. Among these were three of my 
uncles. My mo th Œ my  father was lucky 
because he was one year too old to be 
inducted, but my three uncles weren™t. And 
I want to mention that there was a very 
large catastrophe wh ich happened to them 
as well as to the 50,000, as well as 
200,000 Hungarian army  personnel in Janua
ry of 1943. There wa
s an offensive in 
the middle of the f Œ winter in the 
Don Œ
 bend of the 
Do n
 river in the 
Ukraine
, 
where the Soviet army had a counteroffensiv
e and they  Œ in six 
days they wiped out 
200,000 Hungarian army  men, and 50,000 
Jewish slave laborers; among them, two 

of my uncles died. 
Q: What were their names? 
A: Their name was Œ one was 
Bondi
(ph) 
Korn hauser
, and th e other one was 
Yanu
(ph) 
Pick
. And tw o of my  other uncles, 
L a zlo  K o rn ha u s er
 and 
La zlo  P i ck
 
survived. We did not k
now that they did, but Œ but in  
fact, they did. And they  came 
home about a year and a half later, but th
e other ones died . And many friends whom 
we knew who went, did not come back at th
at point. So I wanted to  mention that. I 
also wanted to mention that
 we fo und out late in 1942 th at the German govern ment 
asked the Hu ngarian govern ment to impl
ement the Final Solution in budap Œ in 
Hungary
, and the Hungarian government refused 
at that point. And th is, of course,

was a Œ was a great relief for us, and 
we really believed that the Hungarian 
government is Œ is not going to  let us go.
 We did not know wh at happened  to the 
rest of Œ of European Jews. We were co
mpletely ignorant. And it is interesting 
because my father and I and 
my mother listened to the 
BBC
 every day, and th ere 
was very Œ there was a lot of news 
about the war, how the war went, and I 
reme mb er very well that we had a big ma
p at home, and my  father had pins, red 
pins and white pins and we always looked at
 the Œ th-the map, and they were telling 
us where the Œ the offensives were, or what
 kind of battles, and my father was a Œ a 
vivid follower of all this. And ther
e was a Hungarian speaking co lonel on 
BBC
, 
who spoke not very good Hungar
ian, very accented Hu ngarian, but he was the Œ the 
war correspondent, and he was the one who ta
lked about all this, and we were very 
Œ very  mu ch listening to  wh at was happening. There was no word , to my  

knowledge, which said anything about camps, or labor camp s or deportation, or 

what happened to the Jews. Was very little, or nothing, no
thing to my recollection. 
And in 1943 wh en
 Œ when this 
[indecipherable]
 breakth rough occurred, was a 
great sadness in 
Hungary
. And I think that even the Jews, of course, felt sad 
because they knew how many Je
ws were killed. And as I 
mentioned, my next door 
neighbor was a Œ was an army  officer, and 
my father and they 
Œ and he very often 
spoke about the Œ how 
the war was going. Now 
Hungary
, of course, was a Nazi

ally, and I Œ today I Œ I Œ to-today I Œ I 
Œ I wonder, you know, this man, he really 
had a great amount of goodw
ill, because he could denounce my father. I mean, my 
father was trying to convince him that the 
Germans lost the war 
in 1943, and in the 
beginning of ™44. And this man,
 of course he di Œ he Œ he
 Œ he talked to my father, 
but I mean, this was a very dangerous thi
ng my  father was doing, and this man was 
really decent enough no
t to Œ not to do anything. On
 the other hand, I reme mber 
another ma n who lived in our building, w
ho was a commander of a Jewish brigade, 
who took this Jewish brigade to the 
Ukraine
. And wh en he came home on fu rlough, 
he was very  proud of the fact that among 
his Jewish slave laborers, there were a 
number of extremely Orthodox Hassidim whos
e beard he personally cut and shaved 
and taught them the delights of eati
ng pork. And th is man, by name of 
Drexell
(ph), 
he was Œ 
Drexler
(ph) rather, he was 
very proud of this. 
Q: What was his first name? 

A: I Œ I do not remember his first name, but
 I reme mb er his last name. and he was 
much frightened after the war, because he kn
ew that he made all these statements, 
and he was particularly frightened  when  he
 Œ when we returned
, and he thought we 
would denounce him; we did 
not. Going back to 1943, 
my father was deactivated, 
and after that we went to a Œ take a Œ a 
week Œ one week vacation to the mountains. 

And it was a Œ a luxury hotel, and Jews we
re allowed to go ther
e. There was only 

 
Interview with George Pick

25
one hotel, which was not open 
to Jews, which was open to army personnel, army 
officers actually. And it was a beautiful 
summer and we enjoyed ourselves very 
much. One afternoon, my moth
er and I took a walk in the woods. And there, in the 
woods, we saw a large group of men in 
N a zi u n i fo rms. T h ey  
were the Hungarian 
Nazis, called the 
Nyilas
, and they had the rally there. 
And that was the first time we 
really saw these people, and they were 
yelling and screaming and we were really 
frightened . And we sort of managed to slip aw
ay, but Œ but this really  sort of banged 
reality to our consciousness in terms of Œ 
well, here these people, we Œ we thought 
these people were underground wi Œ they 
were e Œ theoretically
 illegal, they were 
not allowed. Their leader was in jail, but 
yet they were organizing and they were 
meeting in these places out in th
e mountains, in faraway places from 
Budapest
, and 
Œ and we became more aware that these pe
ople were real. I mean, we Œ we Œ we 
knew the propaganda, we knew that these pe
ople existed, but this was my  firsthand 
encounter with them. 

Q: What™s it like to see someone in a unifor
m like that when you
™re nine years old? 
A: Well, it was quite frightening. We Œ we
 understood, and I understood wh at the 
unifo rm stood fo r, and Œ 

Q: How did you understand? You™re nine years old. 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
26
A: Well, I have seen a lot of propaganda 
leaflets, and they have, all over the city 
they had these Œ these big 
propaganda photographs and 
Œ about the war effort and 
how the Œ these people look in 
SS
 unifo rm, how did the Hu ngarian uniform look 
and how did this Hu ngarian Nazi unifo rm l
ook. Particularly the 
one which we were 
well aware is the armb and wh
ich they wore, which were 
red and white stripes with 
a Œ a large Arrow Cross in th
e mi ddle, green Arrow Cross.
 And we Œ we were Œ we 
recognized that. And as I 
said, it™s just the way th
ey behaved was frighten ing 
enough an d what they  were yelling, slogans
, all this kind of things. They were 
mostly nationalistic and racial slo g ans, 
and they were yelling slogans, you know, 
death to the Jews and all that. And of cour
se that was quite, even at age nine, it was 
quite clear to me that these people were not our friends. 
Q: And how did your
 parents interpret this to you? 
A: Well, we didn™t talk very  mu ch about
 it. I knew that my mother was very 
frightened, and we sort of left, and we trie
d to sort of not to speak about this. We 
thought Œ we didn™t ignore 
it, because I remember it, b u t we did not want to Œ she 
didn™t want to emphasize that, look, these 
people are terrible, and we are going to 
have terrible times. W e really hoped at that
 point that the war is turning, that we 
will be able to survive. Th
at before anything
 would happen, the 
war would be over. 
Q: So it™s 1942 - ™43, and you ar
e still going to this Jewish school? 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
27
A: Yes. 
Q: And then  wh at is the next big change that you remember? 

A: Well, the Œ the Œ the next big change, wh
at I rememb er was that in 19 Œ end of 
1943, beginning of 1944, my  mo ther deci
ded that I am now old enough to  learn a 
little bit ab out music and culture. And next 
door we had a lady 
who happens to be 
Jewish Œ happened to  be Jewish, and who wa
s a violin teacher. And we went there Œ 
actually it was maybe 1943 when I started 
violin lessons. And I never got too far, 
but what I did get out of it 
was a love of mu sic. And I 
rememb er th at in  1 94 3 ,  my  
mo ther decided that we were going to buy
 some sea son™s tickets for  a musical  and 
opera performances. A ll the Jewish perform
ers were thrown out from their jobs in 
1940 - ™41. And in 
Budapest
, in the Jewish community 
center, there was a cult Œ 
there was a Œ like a hall, culture hall. Small hall.  
Q: This is in 
Pest
? 
A: In 
Pest
. In 
[indecipherable]
 12, and it™s called the 
Goldmark
 Hall in memory 
of 
Karl Goldmark
, who was a Jewish composer. And curiously and Œ and 
ironically enough, the people who were th
rown out for the first class, the best 
singers, the best music ians. And so what th
ey did, in order to make a living, they 
essentially organized their or
chestra, and organized thei
r Œ an opera company. And 
almo st daily they had concerts and oper
a performances, and it was a very vibrant 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
28
and I would Œ should say a better quality of 
performance than in 
the opera house. So 
my mother bought tickets, and I remember
 th at my first opera, which I saw, was 
Rossini™s 
ﬁ
Moses
.ﬂ And I saw a number of operas, 
Faust
. And we had opera tickets 
like once e-every two weeks,
 on Sundays. And we had opera tickets for ﬁ
The 
Queen of Sheba
,ﬂ which was a 
Karl Gold mark
 opera for the Œ on the 20 Œ on the 
19
th
 of March, for the 19
th
 of March. And it was a sort of a birthday present for me 
because my birthday™s the 28
th
 of March. So, we ne
ver went. Why didn™t we? 
Because on the morning of the 19
th
, the Germans came in , and the performance was 
postp oned indefinitely. The school went on
 for a couple of mo re Œ I think maybe a 
week or so. 
Q: The Germans came in, wh
at do you remember about 
that day? Can you talk 
about March 19
th
? 
A: Yes, I remember th e Germans came in
, th e tanks came in and it was very 
frightening. 

Q: What do tanks look 
like to a 10 year old? 
A: Huge. I remember the 
Tigers
, they were Œ they were unbelievably big. The 
Tiger 
tanks were the Œ the largest German ta
nks. And I remember, as they rumbled 
through the city, and the street Œ we lived in
 a s Œ on a street which sort of led into 
the center of the city. It was a wide street
, and it was very mu ch Œ it had streetcars, 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
29
but it ha Œ it had enough room for tanks. 
I remember also 12 years later in 1956, 
when the Russian tank
s rumbled on the same street,  to
ward the center of the city. 
But on that 19
th
 of March, it was absolutely fri
ghtening because we did not know 
what was going to happen. 
We knew that something 
terrible had happened. We 
heard the radio, and it was, you know, ev
ery hour on the hour there were mo re 
things, saying, you kn
ow, orders given to various un
its. Hungarian units do this, you 
know, fari Œ code wo rds or code numbers
, you know, 12th Hung
arian division, be 
alert, or bring Œ br
ing yourselves to wh atever c
ity, and so forth. And what I 
reme mb er is the confusion, and the Œ the di
sbelief that th is c
ould happen to us, and 
the Œ an-and the belief that Œ that now,
 something which we didn™t think would 
happen, will. And of course, the optimis
t would say well, you know, what can the 
Germans do? The Germans cam
e in because Œ we know wh
y they  came in, because 
the Russians are pushing the German army 
toward  the west and the Germans want 

to make sure that the Œ th
e German army  has a retreat, you know, it wants to make 
sure that Œ that Œ that it could retreat.
 We also knew somewhat earlier that the 
Hungarian government was already discussi
ng peace feelers with Œ with the Brits, 
and that that government was quite liberal
 and looked the other way. Well, that all 
changed on that day. In three da
ys a new government was sworn in, 
Döme Sztójay
, 
who was a Œ p-prior to this was the Œ the ambassador of 
Hungary
 to  
Berlin
. And he 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
30
was essentially a Œ an Œ he Œ he didn™t 
speak very good Hungarian, he was a 
German himself. There were thes
e Germans in the west side of 
Hungary
, groups of 
Germans living there, we called them 
Schwabs
. They were the Œ th-the ethnic 
Germans, and 
Sztójay
 was one of them. And his go
vernment was containing the 
extreme Nazi elements. The on
ly thing which was relatively 
heartening to  us is that 
the Œ that 
Horthy
, who was the head of the govern
ment, stayed. Now, we fo und out 
that 
Horthy
 was out of the country, and Œ but he 
came back later that afternoon. He 
was with 
Hitler
, and of course that was the trick 
Hitler 
used; while 
Horthy 
was 
out, that™s when  the Œ they cam
e. We also found out that a 
couple of days later, that 
Eichmann
 and co mp any also showed up in  
Budapest
. The reason why I know this 
is that my mother had an 
uncle who was a very prominen
t lawyer, and who was still 
practicing law in 1943. And the reason why 
he was Œ were two reasons. One is that 
he was a World War I hero, a very decora
ted captain of the Au
stro-Hungarian army, 
and he was exempt from Jewish law. An
d secondly, he was a good friend of th e 
German ambassador, 
Jakov
. Well, 
Jakov
 left, 
Veesenmeyer
 came in. And va Œ 
before 
Jakov
 left, he told my Grand-uncle 
Paul
, 
Pa ul Ko rnha user
, whose son was 
lost in 
V o ro n e zh
,
 
that 
Paul
, things are changing. But 
Paul
 was a Germanophile all 
his life, a-an admirer of 
Germany
. Never really believe
d that anything could 
happen to  him. He was a prominent Jew. He
 was not very religious, but he was very 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
31
active in the Jewish community . Many of the Jewish leader
s told him that he™s on a 
list, that he should go into
 hiding. Well, he didn™t. 
In fact, when he got his 
summons, the first one ha Œ 
Eichmann
 did th e same thing as he did everywhere 
else, he™s Œ he summo ned the prominent Jewi
sh leaders the first three days or four 
days after this occupation, to a Œ a interi
m camp , and my  uncle, my  great-uncle took 
his dress uniform, his Hungarian dress unifo
rm with all his meda
ls and went in and 
demanded to be exempted from all these thin
gs. Well, they didn™t exempt him at all. 
In fact, they Œ they  captured  him and in 
a week, he and a hundred  prominent Jewish 
leaders were sent to 
Auschwitz
 and he died  there. So we knew that things are 
happening. We also knew that 
by the fifth of April Œ on th e 28
th
 of March, my  10
th
 
birthday came out a Œ the law that we mu st
 wear the yellow stars in a week. So by 
the fifth of April we all wore the ye
llow stars. That was sort of my 10
th
 birthday 
present. 

Q: How does it feel to wear a yellow star? 
A: Well, it Œ it certainly was Œ was someth
ing different. I was not very easy to 
accept that now everybody kn
ows that I am different
. I mean, up until now I Œ 
people the Œ we Œ we lived in a house 
where Œ in a building 
where two or three 
Jewish families lived, the rest of them we
re not. This was not a Œ an issue, I mean, 
although anti-Semitism we knew about, bu
t as I said, there were a number of 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
32
Christians who were friends, 
and symp athetic. But now, this was a Œ a Œ a huge sign 
on one™s coat. It was e asy to see who was.
 And of co urse, we did not know who th e 
Œ the Œ th e enemies were. Whom, we didn™t know. And it was Œ 
Q: Were you Œ were you 
unhappy about being Jewish? 
A: No, I was not unhappy bein
g Œ being Jewish. No , at that part Œ time, I was 
already very  consciously Jewish. We had 
th e Bible studies and Hebrew in Œ in 
elementary school, and I was much 
mo re conscious about being Jewish. 
Q: Would you have pr
eferred to be something else? 
I™m talking as a 10 year old. 
A: Oh I cert Œ I would have 
preferred to be not there, 
so Œ for sure, but I don™t 
know. I Œ I would say th at I was Œ I was a proud Jew. I w Œ I was Œ probably 
wouldn™t prefer to be anything but a Jew, 
but I certainly would ha
ve preferred to be 
not a Jew who is Œ who is go
ing to be sent to the slaughterhouse. And wh at Œ what 
happened there in the Œ on 
the same day when we started to have to wear this 
Jewish star,  my father and other Jewish 
men from 18 to 60 were 
inducted again. So 
essentially, my mothe
r, my  grandmother and I stayed behind, and my  grandparents.  

Q: Did your mother sew on th
e Jewish star on your clothes? 
A: Yes, and I rememb er that Œ that it was 
in the newspapers, you know, they  were Œ 
they were telling us exactly how big is 
has to be, and how ye
llow and y-you Œ you 
could buy this material, but it cannot be or
an ge, it has to be very lemon yellow, and

it has to be this big and this wide and a
ll these things. And I rememb er how we Œ we 
were cutting it on the Œ on the table, on the 
dining room table, 
these things andwe 
were counting how many we need for the ou
ter garments and inner garments, and it 
was a Œ and then my  mo ther and grandmothe
r were sewing it. And we had to  wear it 
on th e Œ right above our hearts on the left 
side. But what was really traumatic w as Œ 
is as I said, is my father ha
d to leave again, and th is time, of course, what do we do? 
And we didn™t hear from him for a long 
wh ile, and about a month or so later, we 
heard rumors that the Œ that
 the Jews in the countrysid
e Œ and I had 150 relatives Œ 
are starting to be gath ered into ghettos. 
And there was an interesting things which 
happened , which was another lost opportun
ity. My mother™s family had a friend, 
and his Œ he was a Œ a romane Œ he was 
Œ he was a Romanian, or he lived in 
Romania
, but he was Hungarian. And he came to 
Budapest 
in April, middle of 
April, and came to my  mother and said Œ 
Q: 1944. 
A: Ninte Œ 1944, correct. And he said
 to her, he said, look, things in 
Romania
 are 
come and gone. I™ll take 
George
 with me, and he™ll be sa
fe with me. My mother 
refused. So this was another missed oppor
tunity. And then  he went and we never 
heard of him afterwards. We n Œ we d
on™t know wh at happened to  him and his 
family. But he is a Œ he was an old frie
nd, and he was a trustworthy friend. Bu t,

whether it would have been better for me
 to go with him, or not, who knows? 
Obviously, in the final 
[indecipherable]
 I was okay at the end. That happened  in  
April. We didn™t hear abou
t my relatives except thes
e rumors, and these rumors 
were getting mo re and mo re disturbing. Th
en we had a lo t of different rules and 
regulations. We had to  subm
it our radio, our bicycles, 
our telephone. And we were 
cut off from the world, because
 we had no radio, for exam
ple. So we didn™t know 
what was going on. 
Q: You had to give 
up your own bicycle? 
A: I Œ I Œ I had to give up my
 bicycle, I had to give up
 my  Œ our radios, jewelry. 
Q: What that difficult for you as a 10 
year old, to give up your bicycle? 
A: Yes, I did. I would say yes. I Œ I Œ 
it was difficult, and probably more difficult 
was the radio, because it wa
s a lifeline for us. And Œ 
Q: What were you an d your other 10 year ol
d friends talking about? Did you used to 
talk about the war, or did you just 
talk about typical children™s things? 
A: Oh, we would Œ we talk more Œ more
 about typical children™s thing, in the 
school. The school was abrup
tly ending. By th e middle of  April, we had no school, 
it was all finished. It was th
e Œ I comp leted the fourth grade, I got my  paper saying 
that I comp leted the fourth grade and Œ an
d the Jewish kids no lo nger were allowed 
to go to school. I remember the fi Œ about
 two weeks after we had the Œ the red Œ the

yellow star on us, we still went to school, bu
t then it was over and 
they told us that 
we should come in October to
 rigi Œ to register for th
e gymn asium, for high school. 
October was not a good time to register 
that year, unfortunately. At home, there 
were just too many things happening. We
 were listening Œ the 
radio we couldn™t 
listen to, but they had these Œ these an
nouncements which th
ey mounted on the 
walls. And every day th ere was 20 - 30 
different things, you know. We were 
rushing around and we were trying to make
 sure that we have food at home, we 
were Œ 

Q: These are loudspeak ers on th e street, or in the build ings? 

A: They were Œ they were newspaper, mo
stly the newspaper was used. There was 
one thing which I remember in April; my fa
th er was still there, before they took 
him. It was the first raid on 
Budapest
, bombing Œ bombing raid. And my  
grandfather, as I mentioned, on my  fath
er™s side, who lived with my aunt, whose 
husband was also inducted into the 
Ukraine
, they lived in a small h ouse, not too far 
from where we lived. And in th is particul
ar raid, their house was hit. We didn™t 
know this, but my father, after the raid 
was over, went Œ was worried and went over 
to see what happened. And it 
turned out that they were 
in  the basement, and except 
for my aunt, who got hit by something in 
the face, and bleeding, th e grandparents 
were okay, and there was also a cousin. So  all Œ all of them were brought, my  

 
Interview with George Pick

36
mother, my father brought them over. An d my  aunt was bleeding. Her name was 
Elizabeth
. And in our build ing, there was a doc
tor. And he was visiting Œ actually 
was not living th ere, but he visited his sist
er and his mo ther, who lived there. They  
were ethnic Germans, and he was an Œ an 
SS 
officer. And I don™t know how and 
why so naively my  father and mother went 
over to him, and asked him to help, give 
first aid help to my Œ to my aunt. So, rather
 naively my father we
nt down  to ask this 
SS
 doctor to help my aunt. I 
was there with him, and Œ with my aunt. And this man 
Œ I never forget his expression, he had 
very light blue eyes
, and the amount of 
hatred which Œ which came out, was incredible
 and indescribable. What he said, I™d 
never forg et, he says, you dirt
y Jews, you think I will help
 you? He says, you will Œ 
you will die just your brothers and sister
s did, very so on. And th en took and 
slammed the door in front of our faces. A
nd I was completely flabbergasted, and I 
was surprised and shocked by 
th is. We knew his mo ther and his sister for years. 
They lived Œ they 
were just a couple of Œ lived a Œ 
lived just a couple of doors away 
from where we were. They were never ve
ry friendly people, but I Œ we never 
realized that, you know, how much of a Nazi 
they were and he was. In fact, one of 

the interesting side Œ not inte
resting, tragic, I should say,
 was that he also at th at 
time Œ I found out later on that
 he was bragging th at he himself killed 20 Jews. He 
was one of the Nazi doctors who did expe
riments apparently, in the camp s. I don™t

37
know what happened to hi
m after the war. I know that his mo ther and his sister 
survived and st
ayed there. 
Q: Their names? 
A: I Œ I wish I could tell you th e names. I 
Œ I Œ I Œ I wrote down th e names, but I 
don™t have it in my  head
. It starts with an 
H
. A-As Œ if I remember, I Œ I™ll Œ I™ll let 
you know later. But that was right before 
my  father was taken away  in Œ in th e 
middle of April. On ce my  father was taken, and as I me ntioned, we were in a Œ in a 

panic every day because they
 had pages and pages of ne
w regulations and orders, 
which in Œ which affected us. What we have
 to Œ wh at we cannot use, what we have 
to give in, and then finally,when we heard these rumors 
about what happ
ened to the 
Œ the Jews in the provinces 
Œ you know, these were just 
slight rumors, and then we 
got Œ but we were very busy then, because 
we Œ we got the order that we have to 
vacate our apartment, and we have to m
ove into these special Jewish houses.  

Q: Can we just back up a little bit? Do 
you think your parent
s ever considered 
getting, as some people tried to do, gettin
g a baptismal certific
ate? Doyou think 
they ever thought about that? 

A: Well, I know that my fath
er never thought of it. My moth er, in April heard that if 
you get a baptismal certificate, you may be 
ex empt from something, and she talked 
to my father about it, and 
my father said, well, go ahea
d if you want to do it; I am 

 
Interview with George Pick

38
not going to  do it. And I rememb er that she and I went a couple of times, maybe 
twice, to a convent not too 
far from where we lived, wher
e we had these Œ they call 
them white sisters. White si
sters™ convent. And they we
re giving a group of Jews 
lessons about the catechism. And we went
, I think, maybe twice, and then my 
mother saw the futility of it, and 
she said no, forget it. So Œ 
Q: Did it bother you to do that? 

A: It Œ it didn™t bother me to do it. I di
dn™t understand the catechism at all. I 
couldn™t understand wh at Œ it was like Chin
ese to me. B u t Œ but the Œ the sisters 
were kind, and it was Œ if it were someth
ing which would really help, I would say 
why Œ why not to do it? I m
ean, a lot of people did it. It
 turned out that Œ that 
conversions did not help at all. My Œ 
my uncle, who was converted because he 
believed in Catholicism, by the Primate of 
Hungary
 in th e early 30s, and who went 
to church  ev ery Sunday, was inducted as
 a Jew, because both his parents were 
Jewish and he was Jewish and his conver
sion was too late, and the only difference 
between him and my  father was that he wo
re a white armband while my father wore 
a yellow armb and. And Œ but he
 got the same treatment, in
 fact worse, and he ended 
up in 
Auschwitz
 and he was gassed. So we knew 
that Œ that conversions were, at 
that point, ineffective, but when  in Œ wh
en you are in a situation like this, you try 
anything and everything you can. But it alwa
ys struck me and it always stayed with

me, that despite of the fact that my fath
er was Œ I don™t think he had gone into a 
synagogue a half a dozen times in his last 
20 years of his life, he still would refuse 
to do this, and that he was 
very mu ch of a Œ a Œ a Jew. But he allowed us to, if he 
wanted to , they gave us this
 Œ this Œ this choice. So, wh
at happened to us then, May 
came, and we got the Œ the 
order that we have to move. And we moved in June, 
toward th e end of June. We were not allo
wed to take any furniture with us, only 
beds, and only the mo st crucial clothing.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
interview with 
George Pick
. This is tape two, side 
A
. 
A: It was June 17 when  Œ 
Q: 1944. 

A: Œ 1944 when we had the, essentially th
e deadline to move. And my  grandmother, 

my self and my  mo ther moved in  Œ in with my grandmother™s younger sister, who 
lived about two or three blocks away. 
Q: How did you get the order?
 How did they notify you? 

A: Well, they Œ they Œ they
 notified by Œ via newspaper, 
essentially everybody Œ the 
newspapers came out, as I mentioned, wi
th  many, many orders
 every day. And 
repeated deadlines, you know, when you ha
ve to move out and wh at houses are 
available and so  forth. So it was av Œ a lo
t of bureaucratic Œ but very fast. I mean, 
the time the deadlines were days instead of
 weeks or months. And it was quite lucky 
for us that we had, in this apartment 
house wh ere we moved to, we had several 
relatives liv ing there, on 
Co lumbus
 Street. We lived in 
Elizabeth 
Street, which was 
a main street. 
Columbus 
Street was like a side street. 
Q: Did you take anything sp ecial w
ith you from your own apartment? 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
41
A: Yes, I Œ I took some toys; not very 
many, because there was just no room for 
that, because we moved into a two room pla
ce. The si Œ the three of us occupied one 
room, and my  grandmother™s sister, her 
daughter, and the Œ 
and her daughter™s 
brother occupied  another room. And th en we
 had a meet Œ or ev Œ or almo st every 
apartment had a maid room Œ maid™s room 
over the kitchen. And they took a single 
woman th ere, so she was the seventh pers
on living in a two room place. And the 

only thing we could take is 
a Œ is essentially our beds
. And I remember, the room 
was not that ver Œ large, and it was wall to 
wall beds. We had nowhere to eat, or we 

had to sit on a sofa bed to eat, essen
tially. And this was the Œ as I said, the 17
th
 of 
June, and we heard rumo rs that things are 
happening in the coun
tryside. We did not 
know precisely what. 

Q: Were these houses marked in any way? 

A: They were Œ they had the la
rge yellow star, as if to tell 
people that this Œ this is a 
build ing wh ere, you know, Jews live, or le
pers live, whatever you want. There was 
one apartment which was occu
pied by a Christian family. The man was the super of 
the apartment, his name was Mr. 
Vargo
(ph), 
Janus
(ph) 
Vargo
(ph). He was a 
decent fellow, and as you will hear, the Œ 
his actions were quite crucial in saving 
our lives; both my  grandmothers and the re
latives there, and my mother™s and mine. 
We settled in, essentially in the last week 
of June. There were 
a few young people, I 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
42
was the youngest kid, there 
were no kids. There were a fe
w teenagers, mostly older 
people. And almo st daily, toward the end of 
June, we started to have to go down  to 
the air raid shelter, because of
 air raids. I remember one pa
rticular day very vividly, 
and that was July the second
, 1944; it was a Sunday. And 
even before, I was always 
worried about air raids, becau
se evas Œ ever since the Ap
ril air raid, ever since my 
aunt was hurt, I was afraid. And I remember once Mr. 
Va rgo
(ph) 
[indecipherable]
 
was on th e second of July, he Œ after every
body was ordered to the air raid shelter, 
he took me upstairs to the Œ 
just to the street level, to
 show me how beautiful those 
airplanes are. And they were, I mean, indeed
, huge airplanes coming in, hundreds of 
them. And I Œ I can never forg
et the Œ the tremendous nu
mber. I mean, they almost 
covered th e sky. And we were out there ma
ybe one or tw o minutes, and then  I said 
no, I don™t want to stay there, I want to 
go downstairs. So we 
did. And we sat there 
very quietly for about 10 minutes and then  a
ll of a sudden we heard this tremen dous 
crash. At first is a whistling sound, a cr
ash and th e whole building sh ook up. And I 
started to scream and everybody else did to
o, and my mother sort of put my Œ my 
head against her Œ her bosom and trying to
 put her hands again Œ in  my  Œ on my  

ears so that I wouldn™t hear this. And 
a few minutes later another, even larger 
sound, and it was like an ear
thquak e. And we saw Œ we had these blast do Œ doors 
leading to the outside, and Œ and it™s Œ th
is Œ this is a very heavy steel door. And 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
43
along the door you see this brilliant li
ght coming in. Of course, by then the 
electricity was gone, and we were sitting in 
the pitch dark. And Œ and this Œ this was 
like Œ like hell. And it went on for three ho
urs, and we had four mo re very close 
hits, and we didn™t think th at we were going 
to surviv e, and then  we did. And after 
three hours we came up, and wh at we saw 
was incredible. We had Œ this building 
was a three story apartment building. It wa
s sort of stood by itself. About a hundred 
yards behind it, there was a six story ap
artment building, which was hit. And the 
only thing Œ and it was a Jewish house, with
 the same y ellow star like we did. The 
only thing which stayed up there was one 
fire wall, and ever
ything was down on Œ 
in a big heap, and people we
re dead. Across the street th ere was a villa, a private 
home, before the raid. Afterwards, there was 
just a huge crater in the Œ crater in the 
Œ on the Œ on the Œ on the 
earth, and you could see body 
parts. You could see hands 
and legs and 
[indecipherable]
. And this Œ th e right side
 had four tennis courts, 
nothing but a big crater. And th e left side wa
s a Œ just a vacant lot, and a crater. So 
essentially, within a 
hundred  yard s of the building, 
we had four huge bombs hit. 
And I could almost feel even today this Œ 
this smell of Œ of Œ of death there and Œ 
and Œ and everything was smoking, and it 
was blackened, and purple, the sky was 
purple. And some people were optimists. I 
Œ I just can™t believe that people said 
well, maybe this is the end. Maybe Œ maybe 
this was used as a Œ as a camouflage to 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
44
Œ to drop paratroopers here, and maybe th
e Brits and the Americans are here, and 
we will be coming Œ we™ll be 
freed. And of course, that was not the case at all. 
What was the real story was that it was the first carpet bombing of 
Budapest
, and 
30 percent of the city went 
Œ was in ruins, and the Jews
 were blamed for it. And Œ 
Q: How are the Jews blamed for it? 
A: Well, the propaganda, I m
ean, the Œ the radios were blaring that it was a Jew ish 

conspiracy, that Jews left their lig hts on 
th eir buildings to show where the Œ wh ere 
the city was, because of course we had bl
ackouts at Œ at night.
 Well, blackou Œ and 
Œ and of course, if you were caught with a
ny kind of light seeping th rough, that was 
a punishable Œ death punish able offense. 
And when  Œ we were 
very careful looking 
around all the time, to make sure that there is no light, because we were accused of 
Œ of spying, too. 

Q: Was this the first time 
you had seen dead bodies? 
A: It was. Actually, these kind of dead 
bodies. There was one dead  body I saw a 
few days before this. And this happened 
because there was a pharmacist who lived 
in our building and who pois
oned himself, he committed 
suicide, and I saw him. 
Q: This was a Jewish pharmacist? 
A: Jewish pharmacist who lived there,
 and I saw him being taken away in a 
stretcher and he was Œ his hands were Œ I 
didn™t see his face because it was turned, 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
45
but his hands were yellow and were sort
 of hanging down  from the stretcher. And 
that was the first dead body
. But the number of dead bo
dies after this raid, they 
were Œ they were really huge. And the first 
time that I saw  this kind of Œ it™s not just 
dead, I mean, they were
 bloody. It was Œ was Œ was Œ was like hell. 
Q: How does a 10 year old process something like that? 

A: Well, I was absolutely frightened. Afte
r this, every t-two Œ twice a day, all 
regular like clockwork, at 11 o™clock in th
e morning, the Œ the 
westerns allies came, 
and then  nine o™clock at ni
ght the Russians came in bombing raids. And every time 
this happened, my mother 
had a huge pillow, which sh
e put on my head. And to 
show you how traumatic it was, 
it took 30 years for me to  
be able to sleep without a 
pillow over my head. And Œ a
nd it was Œ it was an absolute trauma. I mean, I Œ  I Œ 

even today, if I hear some unexpected la
rge noise, loud noise, I would jump . We did 
not know it at the time, that
 besides the air raid, we had an even  dead lier situation 
developing in 
Budapest
. What had happened  is 3,000 gendarmes came out Œ came 
up to 
Budapest
 two days before, in process, or in
 Œ in  the process of wanting us to 
be deported. In other wo rds, by this Œ by 
the first of July, most of the Hungarian 
Jews from the country side were deported. The only community alive was 
Budapest
. My 150 relatives were largely dead 
by then. We did no
t know this, but 
what had happened is the extreme Nazis wa
nted to commit a coup, and get rid of 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
46
Horthy
. And th ey got these 3,000 gendarmes fo
r two reasons; one is to prepare for 
deportation of the Jews, and numb er two is to get rid of 
Horthy
. And there was 
only just a few, the courage of a few ar
my  officers who were available and who 
were ready to follow orders. 
And one single army  unit, a 
Panzer
 division was 
willing to come to 
Budapest
 to counteract this Œ not ne
cessarily the deportation of 
the Jews, but the Œ the coup
 against the region. And by 
the second of
 July, they 
were around 
Buda pest
, taking up positions. By the seve
nth of July, they forced 
these gendarmes to leave. And 
Horth y
 declared that that day, that they deportations 
would stop. And that, of cour
se, saved our lives, because with 3,000 gendarmes, we 
would be deported in  probably  a week, or 
two weeks. I mean, in si x weeks, almost 
500,000 Hungarian Jews were deported fro
m the countryside. You can imagine that 
160 to 180,000 Jews in Œ in 
Budapest
, were concen trated, could be deported in a 
matter of days. But we were not. And that 
saved our lives. What happened after this 
was a Œ a little miracle. 
Eichmann
 left. He was frustrated by this inaction by the 
Hungarian government. And he also knew 
that things were not going well in the 

front. What we didn™t know, but he did, 
and many of the Nazis did, is that the 
Hungarian government started again some 
negotiations with th
e western allies and 
even with the Russians. And 
these negotiations, essentially, 
they wanted to manifest 
this Œ their good will. So
 the way they did it is th
ey essentially replaced the

47
government with a Œ a government of army
 officers, who were not as extreme. And 
Œ  
Q: Did you ever see 
Eichmann
?  
A: I did not personally see 
Eichmann
, no. 
Q: Did you ever see 
Horthy
? 
A: I have seen 
Horthy
, yes, when  I was a kid, yes. 
Q: What did he appear to you to be like? 
A: Well, he was a handsome old man. He was Œ he was an 
[indecipherable]
 but he 
was a Œ a horseman, and he
 Œ he rode the white hor
se. And we had a national 
holid ay on the 20
th
 of August, which was a holiday fo r the first king of 
Hungary
, 
Saint
 Steven
. And wh at I rememb er about Œ ma
ybe I was six or seven wh en my  
father took me to this
 day Œ the Œ the Saint 
Steven™s 
day on th e 20
th
 of August was a 
great holiday, because his right hand was, as
 a miracle, was preserved. Now, this 
man died a thousand years ago, a
nd his right hand was the icon of 
Hungary
, and 
they took this right hand and Œ and th
ey took it all around 
the city, you know, 
there™s a whole procession. And 
Horthy
 used to ride the horse, also. And I 
reme mb er this procession in  the late 30s
, when  this had happened. And I saw him 
once after that. In 1938, if I reme mb e
r, there was a huge, Catholic congress in 
Budapest
, where the pope came, and Œ or at
 least the man who became pope later, 

 
Interview with George Pick

Pius
 the 12
th
. And he spoke and 
Ho rthy
 was with him and I saw Œ I reme mb er that 
I saw Œ this was a huge thing. He was not ju
st a Catholic thing, he was everybody™s 
thing, and I saw 
Horthy 
that time again, 
the second time. 
Q: Was he a hero to you? 
A: He was not a hero to me, but he was 
not a villain, either. We knew that he had 
Jewish friends. We knew that his best po
ker partner was a Jewish industrialist my  Œ 
by name of 
Goldberger
(ph) and 
Weiss
(ph). And his wife was connected to Œ there 
was a rumor that his wife had Jewish blo
od in her. And that Œ we knew that his 
older son, married to a Œ a countess who wa
s very much pro-Jew. In fact, it tu rned 
out that Œ that she was work ing for the Œ 
the Œ the anti-Nazi resist a n ce. And she™s 
still alive. She™s a very old lady 
now. And we knew that Œ that 
Horthy
, if he was 
not pro-Jewish, he had friends
, and he was not the worst. 
He was not a hero , but he 
Œ as I said, he was not a villain either. So
 going back to my stor
y, we did not know, 
but we were saved. After 
Horthy
 changed the government, things started to be a 
little easier. Up until then, we 
only had like one or two ho
urs where we could go out 
to the street. We were Œ we had a Œ give
n a couple of more hours of freedom, free 
time to go to the street, to shop, for example. 
Q: What did you do inside the apar
tment when you co
uldn™t go out?

A: Well, I was a lonely child, I Œ I didn™t ha
ve people to play wi
th, so I pl
ayed with 
my toys, and I was with the relatives. They pl
ayed cards, and I sort of sat next to my 
mo ther, and they had a Œ a game which they
 played ev ery Œ a day, which was a sort 
of a superstition. I Œ I don™t know if this ga
me exists here, I guess it does. There is a 
[indecipherable]
 like a Œ a 
[indecipherable] 
with alphabets, with Œ with various 
ABC
 and so forth. And wh at they do is th
ey put a Œ an  upside-down Œ a turned  
water glass, and they put their hands on
 and then supposedly
 a ghost comes an d 
then push es the glass and th
en spells out things and tells you your answers, you 
know, and mo st of the questions were, are we
 going to have an air raid tonight, you 
know, and of course we didn™t need to
 know the answer, we knew that it was 
coming. But, you know, some people believed 
this, and we played  that every day. 
That was a Œ a Œ a game we played . And we
 also, as I said, we played various Œ 
various games, word games, and I was so
rt of tolerated by the adults. And I was 
trying to  be a fly on the wall mo st of the 
time, and didn™t do too much. Wasn™t very 
happy and wasn™t very active. I was readi
ng a lot actually, I had a few books and I 
was reading. I Œ I was Œ my favorite author was 
Jules Verne
, and since I was all 
[indecipherable]
 up, I was reading about ﬁ
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
,ﬂ and 
Five Weeks in the A-Air Œ Air Balloon, 
and things like that. I Œ I was always 
interested in Œ in adventures, and it was ce
rtainly an ironic time to read about those

adventures. And that™s what I did. And th
e summer went relatively fast, and Œ and it 
was lucky, because my father™s unit was 
brought back from th
e western parts of 
Hungary
, where they built fo
rtifications to 
Budapest
. And my father was lucky 
because his commander was a decent man 
again. Turned out that his Œ the 
commander™s fiancée was Jewish, and sh
e lived in our bui
lding. And the 
commander sort of looked the other way wh en half of his brigade sort of 
disappeared  every ev en ing, and reappeared 
every early mo rning. 
This was strictly 
illegal. If a man was caught, he Œ under th
e circumstances, he would be subject to 
immediate execution. Nevertheless, my  fath
er, about tw o, three times a week, took 
this chance and came home late at
 night, after curfew, and Mr. 
Vargo
(ph) let him 
in. Mr. 
Vargo
(ph) got a few hundred 
peng
˘
s
 for this act, but nevertheless, he took a 
chance too. My father came in for a few hour
s, and then he went
 back early in the 
mo rning. So  it was happiness that we have 
seen him at that time. A nd again, the 
eternal optimist said well, it couldn™t last
 long. The Ru ssians were already fighting. 
We knew the Romanians were out of the 
war already, and Œ and they know Œ we 
also knew that, you know, the war couldn™t 
last for more than a week or two. I 
mean, the Russians were less th
an a hundred k
ilometers from 
Budapest
 at this 
point. So the October 15 rolled around, an
d October 15 was a very tumu ltuous and 
very important day. That was the day when  
Horthy
 declared that
 Hungary
 was 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
51
becoming a neutral country, and that 
Hungary
 essentially threw in
 the towel. Well, 
I can tell you th at it was unreal for us. We 
heard this on loudspeakers, and we went 
out, and we ra Œ ripped al Œ 
our yellow stars off, and we we
re absolutely hysterical. 
But the people around us were yelling down 
from their windows that we are just a 
little bit too premature, we are a little b
it too happy. And th ey
 said, well, you dirty 
Jews, don™t think th at you will survive. And 
indeed, th ey were more prophetic that 
we realized, because in a couple of hours, 
the Œ this Œ this coup was over. In fact, 
with German help, the mo st extreme Nazi
s, Hungarian Nazis took over. The ar Œ the 
Arrow Cross. And we heard Mr. 
Vargo™s
(ph) radio, he was nice enough to open his 
doors so people could hear through the 
radio, when  they 
were looking for 
Bara kti
(ph) 
Burger
(ph), who was the extreme Nazi general to come to 
Budapest 
immed iate l y  to  assu me th e 
Œ the Œ the comma nd of the Œ 
the troops. And we heard 
by th e end of the day that 
Horthy
 was arrested and then that 
Szálasi
 became the 
head of the state and a new governme
nt was sworn in. And th is was the 15
th
. Ten 
days later, all the women between the ages of Œ Jewish wo men, ages of 18 and 40 
were ordered to come to a soccer field, which was the 
Kishauk
(ph) soccer field. 
And this impacted my aunts, 
Elizabeth
, who was 29, with a baby of three years old, 
and 
Yoli
(ph), who was 38, with a cousin of 
mine, who was my  age, 11 Œ 10 Œ 10 
and a half. And my mother was 43, so sh e was too old to  go, but they did. And

10,000 young women went. The women wh
o had children were excused, and 
Yoli
(ph) left, but 
Elizabeth 
didn™t. She was too tired, she was just Œ she said, I Œ I Œ 
I just give up. And the Œ she was one of 
the ones who were deported. At that time 
they had no transportation except to walk
. They had these death marches. And she 
made the death march, we knew that she di
d, because her friends who su rviv ed told 
us. She got to 
Ravensbrück
, and she died a few days before liberation. She was 29. 
Her baby daughter, 
Susan
, was hidden by an aunt who was not Jewish, who was a 
wife of my uncle, 
La zl o  P i ck
. Now 
La zlo
 
Pick
 was one of the uncles who went to 
the 
Ukraine
 in 1941. He was a th
in, skinny man, but he was a tenacious sports 
person. And he walk ed  the 800
 miles. He just got back 
in March of 1944, just in 
time for the next round. And he was to be
 deported in September, but he didn™t wait 
for that, he took his rucksack, left it and 
went home, where his wife, in an efficiency 
apartment not very mu ch bigg
er than this one, hid him in a closet for three months. 
And she also hid the baby, my  co usin 
Susan
, and they survived
. My father came 
home in the beginning of November, with
 the news that he got the 24 hours 
furlough, and th at he is going Œ he wa Œ if
 he is going back ne
xt mon Œ next day in 
the morning, he is to go to the railroad st
ation, and he knows th
at he was going to be 
taken to 
Germany
, and he was not about to go back
. He had a friend, and th ey had 
a plan. The plan was that they were going
 to my  grandfather™s abandoned building, 

 
Interview with George Pick

53
which was in ruins, but the basement was 
in fairly good sh ape. And they knew the 
war was going to be over in a week, so 
they would go there and they would just 
stick it out there. And my father left, and 
we didn™t know what
 happened . This was 
the sixth of Novemb er. We didn™t know anything. On  the 22
nd
 of November, a Œ an 
army man came over and we were very su
rprised, I mean , you don™t see an army 
soldier coming to a Jewish house. And he came in and he wanted to talk to my 
mo ther and he handed  her a note. And the 
note said that Œ was a one sentence that 
said, you and 
George
 follow this soldier and come 
immediately where he will take 
you. Well, my mother was unhappy about th
is, because she didn™t
 want to leave my 
grandmother and everybody. And Œ and Œ 
or the Œ the message was not to tell 
anybody anything. And so we went, but my  
mother didn™t take anything except me 
with her. And we went to this place, whic
h was a factory building on the other side 
of town , in a blue collar neighborhood, called 
Chango
(ph) Street. And it was a 
factory, a textile factory. And the soldier 
took us there and we met my father. It 
turned out that this factor
y was a camouflage place, 
where they had a bunch of 
Jews, Jewish men, hidden. The outs Œ fo
r the outside wo rld this factory was a 
factory for army  uniforms, Hungarian army
 uniforms. My father was quite mad at 
us when he saw that we just came with no
thing, and to ld us to go back immediately, 
and come the very same evening, come he
ll or high water. So my  mo ther saw when  

 
Interview with George Pick

54
Œ when Œ when she saw Œ wh
en  she saw that he was ma d, we went home. We got 
back and we were terribly 
ru shed, because we had mayb
e a half an hour before 
curfew. And she threw in a couple of Œ sh
e Œ the thing which she was most worried 
about were the family photos
. And she threw in a f Œ th
e family photos in a small 
bag, which I still have. And she also put 
a little food in, and no
thing else. While we 
were in the midst of this desperate pack
ing, the house was raided by two teenage 
Nazis. And they came in, one must not be
en  Œ I don™t think one was mo re than 13 
and the other one maybe 16 - 17. They  ha
d submachine guns with th em. And they 
went and they rampaged the whole place.
 They  Œ they  broke things, they stole 
things, they made a mess. They saw these 
little thing which my mo
ther put together, 
this little bag, and threw it on the floor 
and stomped on it, and they terrorized 
everybody for a couple of ho
urs. And then they finally 
left. And this was after the 

curfew. So my mother put ev
erything back and begged Mr. 
Vargo
(ph) to  let us out. 
Again, little money 
changed hands and 
Va rgo
(ph) let us out and we went. And we 
got there Œ this was end of Novemb er, to
ward the end of November, so it was a 
short day, just like today. An
d by six o™clock or so, it was 
quite late la Œ quite dark. 
We got there and my father was really re
lieved to see us, and 
told  us how he got 
there, because we didn™t know what was going 
on. So he told us th
at he went to this 
rendezvous place with his friend, his name was 
Gargutzi
(ph). And 
G a rg u t zi
(ph)

never showed up. He was caught in a raid, 
and he was killed. So my father was in a 
panic, and went to a frie
nd of his, by th e name of 
Gaykis
(ph), who was a Christian 
business associate, and told him that
 he needs to hide somewhere. Well 
Gaykis
(ph) 
told him that he would be happy to he
lp. He gave him this address, it™s 
Changutca
(ph) 
6B
 address, and gave him a note. 
Told him to Œ not
 to talk to 
anybody, just go there, hand
 the note to the commanding 
officer of this army Œ 
factory. My father did just that, and he ha
nded the note to the 
soldier and Œ and the 
soldier took back the note 
to the army commander and th
en the door opened and he 
was let in, and the army commander went 
to see him. The army commander turned 
out to be a Jew who was a friend of my  fa
ther™s, and who was playing th is role. He 
was a spit and polished army  Œ army  comma
nder unifo rm. And he told my  father 
that 65 people who escaped fro
m deportation are also ther
e. They are all men, and 
he is welcome. And this was in the begi
nning of Novemb er. Toward  the middle of 
Novemb er, the man who heard th e news Œ th ey were mu ch better informed, of 
course, than  us, that things are happeni
ng throughout town, 
they knew about the 
deportation of the women. They
 started to bring their fam
ilies in. So my father also 
took this Œ sent a soldier 
who was a deserter Œ a real
, bona fide soldier, but a 
deserter, to the note Œ with 
the note to my mother, and that™s how we got there. 
Well, my  mo ther didn™t bring anything and 
so my father™s overc
oat served for the

next three months as our blanket. We did not know what
 had happened, but this is 
what happened, the very next day: the 
Arrow Cross raiders came back, and took 
everybody from the building wh
ere we lived, to the bricky
ards. And at that point, 
Mr. 
Vargo
(ph), who knew of a brother, my  gra
ndmothers had a Œ tw o sisters and a 
brother in 
Budapest
. And a brother lived in a 
Swedish house, Swed ish Œ 
Q: Safe house. 
A: A safe house, correct, safe 
house, which was a Œ was saved by 
Wallenberg
. And 
Mr. 
Vargo
(ph) ran to  this man, by the name of 
Beyla
(ph)
 Kornha us Œ Beyla 
Spitzer
(ph), and tell him that Œ told him that his three sisters were in  the brick 

factories. And 
Spitzer
 was able to get in touch with 
Wallenberg
, who went and 
took the three ladies, and one lady™s daught
er with her Œ with him, and to ok Œ took 
Œ took th ese four people to the safe house.
 The other ones were deported, and Œ by 
foot, and none of them came back. We 
would be among those 
who were deported, 
and who would have been, of course, the vict
ims. This we found 
out later, after the 
war. In the place where we now were in the 
factory, we had about 120 - 130 people. 
They  had a bunch of kids, young women an d 
in a few days we found out that there 
was a group of young people wh o were runn
ing around in Nazi uniforms, but they 
were Jews. And they  had a Œ a group of 
five or six people who went to the 

deportation trains and to the 
roads, to snatch so
me people back. They had papers, wi 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
57
Œ which were forgeries, which said that 
such and such  people 
would have to be 
brought back to headquarters
 because they wanted to 
interrogate them. And this 
way they brought in more th
an 50 people back  from the 
road, who were already to 
certain death, mostly Œ mo
stly young women, and some
 young men, but mostly 
women. And so in the next week  or so, th
e number of people went to about 170. We 
had ab out 22 kids, some of them were
 younger than I, and it was a Œ a great 
camaraderie. I mean, since Œ since the early sp
ring that year, in 
1944, I haven™t been 
with kids. And it was a lot of fun, and wh
at was fun about it is that this Œ this 
factory had a bunch of machin
es, big textile machines a
nd we were av Œ able to 
explore these, and a few of us were curi
ous, particularly one fellow. His name was 
Foti
(ph). 
Foti
(ph) 
Yonchee
(ph)
 
and 
John Foti
(ph). And he was my  age, and he Œ 
we went on, and we played with  these mach
ines and it was just a lot of adventure. 
We also found that there was a garage, or so
rt of a shed, which had a Œ a lot of hay. 
And the hay was important becau
se attached to the factor
y, there was a horse, and a 
Œ and a lorry. Ho rse and a lorry. And th e hay was, of course, his food, horse™s food. 
But wh at we found out, which was very inte
resting and uk Œ unex pe
cted is that one 
of the young men who was in this resistan
ce told us that under the hay there was a 
car, a personnel mo torcar, which they use to rescue people.

Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
George Pick
. This is tape number two, side 
B
. 
A: Okay, so what we found ou
t is that under the hay was 
this car, and they gave us 
the permission to go into the 
car, and it was, of course, very
 exciting. This Œ this car 
was an early 
−koda
, model 1930s. And at that time,  in order to start the car, you 
had a piece of Œ a steel rod you had to pu
t in in  the front and make it, you know, 
move it around. Bu t these people 
told us, and I am sure this 
was a fib, that in fact Œ 
in fact that™s thing was not a part of th
e starter, but it was a machine gun built into 
the car, and that this would be used 
in case something happens here. And we 
believed that, it was a good Œ good fib, an
d it was certainly an in teresting story. 
Unfortunately the reality was a little less in
teresting. What had 
happened is that on 
the second of December, we heard a Œ a ve
ry powerful knock on the door, and there 
were only f Œ a few seconds before we h
eard ru nning steps. We Œ our Œ our rooms 
were on th e second floor, second story of th
is place. It was really camouflaged as 
work rooms, but by the time we reached
 this number of people, there was not 
enough room to sleep on the fl
oor, so they build these multip
le Œ actually three story 
Œ 
Q: Bunks? 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
59
A: Bunks, I guess you can call them. And 
they  brought the hay from downstairs and 
we Œ we slept on the hay and we used the 
army uniforms, we had several hundred  of 
those, as blankets and pillows, whateve
r. And we were in a middle bunk, and I 
reme mb er t h e 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did you ba Œ did you stay
 with the children, or did 
you sleep with the children, 
or with your mother? 
A: No, I slept with my mo
ther and my father. The 
families stayed together. 
Underneath there was another family with
 a little girl I remember, her name was 
Onchee
(ph). She was about two or three years old and she made a racket and sh e 

made her grandpa Œ Papa, very, very mad 
all the time, and she knew how to push 
his buttons. And it was hilarious, I mean, it 
was really funny. Very  close by, there 
was a young lady, young 
woman. Her name was 
Cotto
(ph) 
Ferhier
(ph). And she 
was a Œ she was marri e d , she was 22 years ol
d, and we got very good friends. Sh e Œ 

she was patient enough with me and I talked
 to her about my stories I read and all 
these things, and I was 10 going on 30, and 
we really became very good friends and 
my mother and father didn™t 
mind that at all, because of
 course, they  didn™t have to 
babysit me. And that was another friendship,
 but she was more in
terested in another 
fellow, who was a young man by the name of 
Bondi
(ph). And 
Bondi
(ph) was one 
of the Œ the refugees there, the Œ the one
 who was able to escape from deportation. 

 
Interview with George Pick

And 
Bo ndi
(ph) one day, and this was the ve
ry end of November, I think the 30
th
, 
got very, very sick. And he got high feve
r and he was deliri
ous. And the committee 
who ran this place had a real dilemma, they 
didn™t know what to 
do. If they bring in 
somebody from the outside, you know, they
 may jeopardize 129 
Œ 69 people, and if 
they don™t, they may have 
Bondi
(ph) dead within a day or two. Well, they decided 
the next day, wh en 
Bondi™s
(ph) condition became worse,
 that they were going to 
bring somebody in. And Œ and they brought 
a Christian docto r in late at night, and 
he gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that
 it was an infection. And in a day or so, 
he got better. The date is very important, 
this was the first of December. In the 
mo rning of the second, we heard th e running steps, and as we were trying to 
scramble fo r some shelter, we saw  five 
men running in with submachine guns and 
yelling and screaming us and 
saying th at we know who you are, you are just a 
bunch of dirty Jews who are trying to Œ to  
hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi 
state police. This was the gest Œ the Hunga
rian Gestapo. And they sorted out the 
men to one side of the room, and women 
an d children to the other and we thought 

that this was the end. I mean, there was 
just no way. Within the few seconds of 
confusion, one man, 
John
 dove out the window and in to another building. It was 
like six or seven feet, and he really jump
ed, and he crashed thro ugh a Œ a Œ a glass 
door Œ glass enclosure. And his luck was 
that it was a haystack
 underneath, so he

61
got into  the haystack. And they  ran after hi
m, they tried to push
 the haystack, they 
couldn™t find him. But we we
re captured, and we thought 
that this was going to be 
the end. But for a while nothing happened,
 and about 20 or 30 minutes later, th e 
detectives, one of the leaders of the detec
tives came out of the office, and made the 
following startling statement, that henceforth
 we are under their protection. An d we 
just couldn™t figure out what happened. Th
ere was only one arrest which they  made, 
and that was a na Œ a man by the name of 
Kormus
(ph). 
Kormus
(ph) was the Œ the 
leader of the group. No t the commander, bu
t the real leader, the organizer. I didn™t 
know much about 
Kormus
(ph), but I found out later what
 Œ who he was. They  took 
him and they  took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in
 cash, which by shee
r luck was there, 
because there were a number of extremely ri
ch people in hiding. 
So in other words, 
they bribed these detectiv
es. And they left with 
Ko rmu s
(ph) and th e money, but 
they left us behind. After the 
war I found out that they took 
Ko rmu s
(ph) and th ey Œ 
they tortured him for two days because th
ey knew that this, our place, was not the 
only one. In fact, it was a networ
k of four places, all of which 
Ko rmu s
(ph) ran. 
They knew of three, our place, an
d another two. And what happened is 
Kormus
(ph) 
was betrayed. We thought that the doctor di
d Œ betrayed  us, it was not the doctor. It 
was a man by name of 
Althurdi
(ph), who hid 
Ko rmu s
(ph) and his family for 
months. And the speculation was that he wa
s either blackmailed, or he didn™t get 

 
Interview with George Pick

62
enough money, but he betrayed 
Ko rmu s
(ph). He knew of three places 
Kormus
(ph) 
could have been, and he knew of a fourth 
place, but he did not know the address of 
the fourth place. So when he Œ when 
Kormus
(ph) was betrayed, they raided three 
of the four places, 
Kormus
(ph) happened to  be in our place. But the fourth  place 
they didn™t know. The fourth  place was a factory in  another part of 
Budapest
 with 
350 Jewish slave laborers who 
were essentially also hiding 
there. But th
ey, the slave 
laborers were armed, and th ey had a mi ssi
on there. They  were armed, and their 
mission was that they would 
save the utility companies of 
Buda pest
. The paper said 
Œ they were all in army  unifo rms Œ their pape
r said that they would be the last o n e to 
stay, to blow up these utilities, the ga
s Œ gas company, the Œ the wa Œ the 
waterworks and so fo rth, and the electric 
comp any. That was the paper which said, 
but the real mission was to, in fact, save
 these utilities. And ev
ery day they were 
trained like soldiers. Every night on the 
other hand, they we Œ they had a little 
factory underneath and they fo
rg ed  papers. And th ey work
ed with the Zionists and 
they work ed with ou
r little group, and they  were part of the Hungarian Jewish 
resistance, and 
Ko rmu s
(ph) was the head. So  
Ko rmus
(ph) Œ they  Œ they knew 
Kormus
(ph) knew about this and they tortured
 him. He did not 
speak, and because 
he didn™t show up fo r two days, they knew in
 the fourth  place, that things were bad, 
so they left. They Œ they Œ 
they  Œ they couldn™t accompl
ish their mission, but they

were all safe, they were able to escape. And then 
Ko rmu s
(ph) was sentenced to 
death, and they took him to the 
Danube
, but he was able to escape. He was very 
sick because of the fact that 
he Œ they tortured him, but 
he escaped. He was able to 
hide, and he survived the war. The other tw o places which were raided, were not as 
lucky as we were. They  had not many rich
 people there and they  were deported. 
One was deported on foot to Œ to 
Germany
, and they  all died. And th e second part 
was taken to political headquarters, and th
ey Œ they were am
ong the ones who were 
sentenced and 70 of them were taken to th e 
Danube
, and only 
Kormu s
(ph) was 
able to escape. The rest of
 them were shot into the 
Da nube
. So our group was 
essentially the Œ out of the 
three groups, our group was 
the only one who survived. 
After this happened, the committee wh
o ran the building decided that the 22 
children were not safe, so th
ey decided to take us from Œ ranging from age of six 
months to 11 years, I was among the ol
dest. And one lady wh
o Œ who had th e six 
months old son, I think, th
ey took us to a Œ a Red Cross build ing wh ich was in the 
middle of the city. We took the lorry and the soldier brought us
 to th e Red Cross 
building. And the idea was that this was a 
protected building, we
 would be fed there 
and we would be okay. That was the theo
ry. The practice was 
that when  we got 
there, there were about three or 400 childre
n, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half 
a dozen adults. I didn™t 
like the place at all. 

 
Interview with George Pick

Q: When  you said this was a Œ another 
protected build ing, protected by whom? 
A: By th e Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross bu
ilding, okay? They we
re the Œ they had 
about 30 buildings through
out town , wh ich were run by the Swiss Red Cross, like 
the Swedish buildings, this Œ but this wa
s not within that enclosure, you know. 
There was a Œ what they called an inte
rnational ghetto, where the Swiss, the 
Swedes, the 
[indecipherable] 
and the Span ish had rented  buildings, about 32 
build ings. This was in a part of town, and 
they were all concentrated. That™s where 
my  grandmother and my  grand-aunts and unc
le were. The Red Cross buildings were 
throughout the city, they we
re essentially Swiss protected. No t very well, as you 

will hear in a minute. But at 
the time that I g o t there they were protected, and they 
were concen trating children there. Now, 
the idea was that there were adults who 

would supervise these children, they woul
d bring hoo Œ fo od an
d everything. Well, 
the Œ that was the theory. 
The practice was that the building was almost empty. I 
was put in with a friend of mine, into a ro
om where we had about 35 children of my  
age. No furniture, we were 
sleeping on the floor and we 
were told that there is no 
food for the day. Well, I wandered around 
and I was crying, and I me t a friend of 
mine from school there, who was there w
ith his sister. I knew him, his name is 
Mike Vairmas
(ph). He now lives here in this co
untry. And he was telling me that 
he wa Œ he just came in a few days earlie
r and they are thinking about leaving the

build ing, escaping, because they haven™t go
tten any food there since they came. So, 
a young girl saw me there cr
ying, and asked me why I wa
s crying, and I was saying 
I was hungry and I was lonely fo r my  mo the
r. This young girl has a boyfre Œ had a 
boyfriend who was in a Nazi uniform, and w
ho to ld me that he wo uld be mo re than 
happy to take me back. Well, I knew that 
that was not the right answ er, and I knew 
that I had to escape now, cause I knew that 
if this man would take a Œ take me  back 
to wh ere we are hiding, you know, he would betray us. So 
John Foti
(ph) and I 
decided that in the very next morning,we are going to take off. And the building 
was locked from the inside, so we couldn™
t just walk out. And the next mo rning 
when the employees came, there was a ki
ndly lady who came a
nd we asked her to 
take us out so that we could buy some fo
od. And as she took us out, we ran away 
from her.  

Q: Wasn™t that a very brave decision? Yo
u™re 11 years Œ 10 years old, to do that? 
A: It was a brave decision, but it Œ we ha
d no choice, because if
 we went back, the 
Nazi would recognize us, would take us to
 wh ere my  father and mother and the 
other people were hiding. I didn™t want to
 take that chance. The chance was that 
they would catch us somewher
e, because they were look
ing for kids too, and of 
course we didn™t wear our Œ our yellow sta
r. That was the chance I had to take. It 

took us a couple of hours 
to Œ to get back. We were 
sort of ducking various little

groups of Nazis who were patrolling the st
reets. We bought a newspaper, which we 
pretended to read. We took a numb er of
 streetcars to go, and we knew where Œ 
where the place was, so we had to change 
like three times, and we got back there. 
My mo ther couldn™t believe that I did co
me back and we came back. We were the 

only two kids who Œ who did co me back. Af
ter the war I found ou
t that about three 
days later, the Nazis raided the buildin
g and they took the children to the 
Da nube
 
and they  shot them. And my  friend 
Mike
 and his sister escaped just a day or so 
earlier, but not the rest of them; the rest of 
them all died. So here we were, this was, 
I think maybe the 10
th
 of December. A few days afte
r this, two policemen showed 
up in our building and told us 
that the detectives sent out 
Œ sent them to let us know 
that we are under suspicion by some of th
e Nazis, who live in the area, and they are 
about to report this suspicious building 
and people. And that they da Œ they  

suggested that we should fo
llow th em, they would take us
 to the ghetto. The ghetto 
in 
Budapest
 was established at the very end of Novemb er. And th e people wh o 
were still in the Œ the yellow stone Œ yellow st
arred houses were taken to the Œ to the 
places. Now, many of the yellow starred 
houses were raided, and many of the 
people already were deported, but in the 
middle of Decemb er, which is what Œ what 
was, there were Œ 
Buda pest 
was almo st comp letely surrounded by Ru ssian troops. 
And so the Nazis decided that they woul
d concentrate the Jews who are left in

Budapest
 into a small ghetto in the middle of 
town, which was the 
Œ used to be the 
Jewish quarters. And then they  would do something. And so , on the 14
th
 of 
December, the ghetto was alrea
dy established and these policemen told us
 that they 
would go ahead, we would be behind them, 
they would not look back, and nothing 
else was said. Well, of the 150 people 
roughly, only 65 arrive
d in the ghetto. The 
rest sort of evaporated along the way. My
 father decided that we have nowhere to 
hide, so we went back  to th
e ghetto. The ghetto, as I men
tioned, was in a very poor 
section of town, the Jewish quarte
rs. The center of it was a square, 
Klauzá l
 square, 
and in th at square, or one part of th e 
square was a mark et. They took us to the 
market, where the Nazis Œ a number of Nazis 
were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us 
that, if you have any jewelry, mo ney, they 
are going to  do a body search, and if they 

find anything, they ™ll shoot us. There was a 
dead body to sh Œ 
to prove the point. 
And we didn™t have anything,
 but a couple of people di
d, and they  would thro w the 
Œ the jewelry into the sewer rather than gi
ving it to these people. Of the 63 of us 
who got there, we were separated into se
veral groups. The group which my  father 
and I Œ my  mo ther and I stay
ed with were about 20 peopl
e. We were just taken to 
the other side of the square, is 
Klauzá l
 square seven, a three story old building. 
Turned out that 
this building housed  a Œ the remn
ants of a old age home, old age 
Jewish home, brought in, and the first two 
stories Œ floors, were quite chock fu ll of

68
people, but the third story was empty. So  
they  gave us two rooms there, and it was 
dirty and no food. And I rememb er that afte
r Œ the day after we arrived, my father, 
who was always enterp rising, he was lookin
g around and he found a piece of bread, 
which mu st have been  six m
onths old. And bugs were 
jumping all over the place 
out of it, but he said, that™s okay, beca
use we™ll toast it an d then we can eat it. 
That™s precisely what we did, somehow we 
toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we 
ate a piece of it. That was th
e food for that particular day. People were not very 
choosy at that point. My father also we
nt around to see what Œ what was the 
situation in the ghetto. The 
ghetto was Œ th-the area origin
ally was an area for about 
12,000 people. By the time we got there, th
ey had ab out 40,000 people living there, 
and at its peak they had 70,000 people. 
So you can imagine th
at there were not Œ 
there was not mu ch room around.  
Q: Did you feel older than your age by th
at time, because of what you had been  
going th rough? 
A: Abso lutely yeah. I didn™t feel like a ki
d at all. I mean, all these th ings age Œ age 
people pretty rapidly, and Œ and I reme mb
er that, you know, walk ing around with 
my  mo ther on th e Œ on the streets and seei
ng people in Œ in terrible physical and 
mental condition, and dirty and broken dow
n, and it was Œ it was very depressive.

Q: Did you feel any responsibility for your 
mother or your father, or did you feel 
that they were still taking care of yo
u? Had the Œ was it still a parent-child 
relationship? 
A: It was still a parent-child relationship, 
essentially, yes. And my father was not a 
part of Œ you know, he was 
a take charge person, he wa
s not a person who would Œ 
who would break down. In Œ in fact, you 
know, he was my  hero, because he was 
very brave man, as you will hear what happ
ened there. What he did is he looked 
around for possibilities, and on
e possibility was to
 join the ghetto 
police. Now, the 
ghetto police in 
Budapest
 was a very different 
from the ghetto police in 
Warsaw
 or 
Lódz 
or any of these other places. This is 
now the middle of Decemb er in 1944. 
The Russians are completely surrounding this place. The 
ghetto police™s mission is 
different. The ghetto police™s mission, ri
diculous as it may sound, was a defensive 
mission. They™re supposed to persuade or 
Œ or Œ or fight off the Nazis coming into 
the ghetto. And the means for that was a nightstick and a Œ and a Swiss beret and a 

Œ a armb and, a white armb and which says gh
etto police in three different languages; 
Hungarian, German and Russian 
[indecipherable]
 languages. And he had an 
I.D.
 
card saying he was ghetto police. Well, one 
of his lucky strokes was that he found, 

in the basement of the building wh ere we
 stayed, a hardhat. These Œ you know, 
what Œ what the Œ

Q: Construction wo rkers? 
A: Construction workers wear. A ctually, th
e firefighters. And he always wo -wore 
that. That saved his life mo re than once. A
nd the reason why he wa
nt to Œ or wanted 
to join the ghetto po
lice force was that the ghetto po
lice had double rations, and he 
wanted to  bring the ration home. The poli
ceman™s life were very difficult. They 

were on patrol 12 - 14 hour
s a day. And as I said, their mission was Œ their main 
mission was to try to fight off the Nazi
s. Well, you don™t fight off people with  
machine guns when they come
 in, and of course, they c
ouldn™t. Many of them died 
because of that. They tried to
 be polite to the Nazis, who 
simply let a Œ a slug of Œ a 
slug into them. There Œ a few days after 
we moved in , at night, we heard this 
tremendous noise and a huge cr
ash. We found out that th
e shell, an artillery shell 
was shot into the ghetto. We don™t know w
ho shot it, but it landed in the next room 
from where we were, and th e people who we
re there, died. And it was a wall away 
from where we were, where my father, moth
er and I were. I got hysterical and I 
said, I™m n o t staying up here
, and my  mo ther and I and 
Cotto
(ph), who was with us, 
the Œ the young lady who we met in 
Chango
(ph), the three of us moved down  to the 
basement. The basement was very deep . It 
used to be the shop of wo od maker and it 
was covered with wood saw, and we just
 slept there. They had a couple of 
workbenches there and I never moved out of 
that place after that happened. I never

needed  to move out because 
in about two days, the Œ wh ich was Ch ristmas day, the 
siege of 
Budapest
 began, and ev erybody move
d on. The food supply was 
catastrophic. We had people who were ol
d Œ and I mean old Œ battle hardened  
Hungarian Jewish slave laborers, the remnan
ts of the people who were taken out in 
1941. Ab out a half a dozen of them ended 
up in our building. 
A number of them 
were very religious Jews, and they were Ha
ssids and they  were praying all day long. 
A number of them were not too religious, 
but none of them were willing to risk 
their lives at that point to bring food. Th
ere were food available about a block or a 
block and a half from where we lived, but 
somebody had to go there and get it. My 
father always volunteered, but he was not 
enough just by himself, and a few people 
went and some got hurt. And so our fo
od supply, because of this, was very 
precarious. People knew that the war couldn
™t la Œ end up Œ I mean, how long could 
you live like this? There was no water, ther
e was no electricity, gas, nothing. Wh at 
we had was about 200 people in a small ba
sement, which had no electricity, w ith a 
couple of slit windows eight 
feet high or nine feet high,
 and a couple of cans of 
floor wax. I remember that I contributed on e of my shoelaces as wick s and we put Œ 
put it in the can and that was the Œ the lig
ht which 200 people had. My father Œ I 
haven™t s Œ you know, I Œ afte
r the siege begun, my  father was mo stly out, he Œ he 
didn™t come home very  often. One time I re
memb er wh en  h e came in , h e came in  

 
Interview with George Pick

72
only for Œ for a few minutes. He came in w
ith the good news that he found his own 
parents in the ghetto, and his parent
s were in reasonably good shape. 
Q: What were the sanitary conditions
 like in the basement in the ghetto? 
A: Well, the sanitary conditions were Œ were
 horrible. What they
 had to do was to 
dig a Œ a latrine in the middle of the room
. And th ey had some old bed sheets, and 
they got a couple of pieces of wood and 
you know, you sort of
 leaned against it 
when you had to do your th
ing. But the stench was u
nbearable. And then, because 
we were very close together, people starte
d to have lice, and because we were close 
proximity, everybody got it. An
d the way we Œ we lived th
ere, we Œ we raided the 
bil Œ the upper part of the building and 
got the Œ the doors out and put the doors 
down and the people essentially slept on 
the doors. We still had my father™s 
overcoat, who would have really needed it in
 his forays in Œ out
side, but he didn™t 
have it because we were using it. 

Q: How did you keep  yourself clean? 
A: We didn™t, we couldn™t. There was so
me little water, but it was negligible, and 
mo st people just gave up on 
it. And you know, for the last
 two weeks, two or three 
weeks, it was just nominal washing. Some
 people tried to do it. Interestingly 
enough, the Œ the mo re well educated were the ones wh o sort of gave up; the least 
well educated ones, who tried 
to keep their Œ their cleanl
iness. And it was a Œ it was 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
73
an interesting Darwinian selection. One of
 the things which happened is that old 
people died. They  starved to death and we 
found them in the mo
rning. And in a lull 
of fighting, a few men volunteered to brin
g them out of the building, and threw 
them on a pile of dead bodies which were
 piling up in the middle of the square. I 
went Œ 
Q: Was it Œ was it easier for you by then to
 see dead bodies, since you had seen so 
much? 
A: No, it wasn™t easier. I think it Œ it Œ it 
Œ it never was Œ was easier for me. I Œ I 
knew that those people were alive a day befo re, and I knew them, I spoke to  them, 

some of them. I could never take this fo
r granted. And I remember o n ce when I Œ 
when the lull in the fighting sort of pers
isted for an hour, I came out and I looked 
out and I saw this Œ this hill of bodies. 
And I knew that if something will not happen 
very soon, we would all e-end up there. I di
d not Œ did not think that any one of us 
would su rvive. And then Janua
ry came, and we were all lethargic, we were sort of 
sitting there, weak. And tha Œ at that poi
nt there was very fe
w who had any spark 
left. And on the fourth of January, a grou
p of about 30 or 35 
young ladies, young 
women were brought 
in. Turned out that
 they were from 
Wallenberg™s 
houses. 
Wallenberg
 was very concerned th at he could no
t really protect people any more at

74
that point, and he d
ecided that many of the people wh
o were still alive there Œ his 
houses were raided by the Nazis Œ he decided Œ 
Q: What di Œ wh at did you 
Œ wh at had you heard about 
Raoul Wallenberg
 previous 
to this date? 

A: Very little. This was the fi
rst time that I h eard of his name, from these people 

who came from his house. I-I Œ most of 
the things which I knew about him, I 
learned after the World War. I knew that 
Raoul Wallenberg
 was trying to save 
people, and it wasn™t just 
Wallenberg
 incidentally, but other people in 
organizations. We knew about the Swedes, we knew ab out the Sw iss. We had, for 

example what they call 
schutz
 pa sses, safe p assages. Th
e Œ they had forg eries by 
the hundreds of thousands. Everybody had 
a couple of them in the pockets. We 

didn™t know whether they were
 real or forged. At that 
point, sometimes it helped, 
sometimes it didn™t. 

Q: Did your fami ly have any 
schutz
 passe s?  
A: Yeah, we had Œ we had 
schutz
 passes. My mother had 
them, I had, my father 
had. 

Q: How Œ how did th ey get them? 
A: I Œ I guess at that point, they were gi
ven. They  were given aw ay  by Jewish 
organizations. I sa Œ I™m sad to say that so
me of the Œ the Jews did not give them

away for nothing, they  Œ they  made money 
on it. We were Œ we didn™t have very 
mu ch money, we never had Sw edish passpor
ts, which was expensive. So we had the 
Swiss, which was cheap, or nothing. But it 
wasn™t Œ it really didn™t matter most of 
the time. I mean, most of the 
Nazis really didn™t look at 
the paper, they Œ they threw 
away. Bu t sometimes you never knew whether 
it had or not. So Œ for some people it 
had sometimes. 
Q: Did you ever have to  show yours? 
A: We never had to show ours. We had it 
in our pocket, but we
 never had to show 
ours. 
Q: Did your parents try to get 
into  one of those safe houses? 
A: No. As I mentioned to y
ou, our Œ our Œ our story was 
th at my  f Œ  my  mo th er an d  
I stayed in the Œ in the re 
Œ in the yellow star house until we went into hiding. And 
the only people who went into the safe 
houses were my  grandparents Œ my  Œ my  
grandmother actually, and my  
grandmother™s sisters who,
 through the good offices 
of 
Raoul Wallenberg
 were able to Œ 
Q: I meant, did they  try to get into  any of the safe houses. 

A: No, they did not, no. Not that I 
know of. Remember, 
there was very little 
communication betw een people at this point, 
there were no telephones. Each house, 
each yellow star house was sort of an isla
nd. We did not know
 what happened to

76
fair Œ friends, relatives, a
nybody. And we did not know what was going on in the 
outside world. So at this point, this wa
s the first time we knew about, or I f-found 
out about safe houses. I found out that th
ese safe houses were no lo nger safe, and 
these people were brought in. They were 
better fed than we 
were, but they were 
very frightened. And we squeezed them in 
as everybody Œ at that point it was not 
that much of a squeeze because  most of the older people 
died already. So this was 
the case. Tenth of January rolled around,
 an d we were even weaker. A young 
SS
 
soldier came down. He was surv
eying the building. He told 
us that the whole ghetto 
is mined, that we will not survive, and just
 forget it. They will not allow the Jews to 
survive. The Russians were 
very close, but before the Russians would get there, 
they would blow them up Œ blow th e ghetto 
up. Turns out that Œ that the real plan 
was even more sinister. I do not know whethe
r the Œ this Œ this was really a fake 
story or not.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
George Pick
. This is tape number three, side
 A
. 
A: The Œ the real plan was more sinister 
than the one which the 
soldier disclosed to 
us, namely that they would blow up th e gh
etto. The real plan was to massacre u s on 
Œ for the 16
th
 of January, there was a massacre in plan, 500 
SS
, a couple of hundred 
Hungarian police. The number of Hungarian 
Nazis would come in with submachine 
guns, and would line us up e
ssentially, and Œ and mo w us down . It turned  Œ turn ed 
out that fortunately, 
Wallenberg
 found out about it on the 15
th
, and he sent a 
message to the 
SS 
general. His name was 
Schmidhuber
, that if this happens, he 
would personally guarantee that 
Schmidhuber
 would be hung. Apparently 
Schmid huber
 was a middle-aged man and he was now concerned about his own 
welfare. And he called Œ called this action 
off. That obviously saved the people, my 
life, my father™s, mother™s, 
my  relatives and the 7,000 people who were still alive in 
the ghetto. This was on the 15

 - 16
th

 in our building, her 
name was 
Alice
. She was about eight years old, and sh e was a weak little kid. She 
was not very alive. She had a mo ther, a

and the grandmother was also. And sh e ca

to everybody to  beg for some food fo r he
r mo ther, who Œ who was in a diabetic 
shock. We had very little, na
mely and specifically, we 
had about a quarter of a 
pound of sugar. As I mentioned earlier, wh
en we left our house, our home, the 
Jewish re Œ yellow star home to go into hi
ding, my mother took very  little food with 
us. This food was shepherd ed
 along since Novemb er, now it™s January. The la Œ the 
Œ the Œ a month of food which is left in th
at little bag is fa Œ 
is a half a pound of 
sugar. My mother kept it fo
r me because she felt that maybe a few sugar cubes 
would save my life if Œ if it all comes down 
to that. So my moth
er refused to give 
Alice
 any fo od. This was the 17
th
. On the 18
th
 of January in the mo rning Œ on the 
evening of the 17, my  fath
er came home and he decided to stay home. On the 18
th
 
there was a strange quiet. We didn™t know 
what happened. It wasn™t as quiet for Œ 
for weeks. I mean, this was a 24 hour a 
day artillery duel and 
bombing raid and we 
didn™t know how mu ch  was left over of th
at city. And all of a sudden it was Œ was 
strange. So somebody climbed 
up to that slit window, about
 nine feet about th e Œ 
the floor of the baseme nt and saw some st
ran g e boots. They were not Nazi boots, 
they were Russian boots, and 
we were liberated. There wa
s no elation. We vid Œ we 
really even didn™t say anything to each ot
her. It was fear that the Nazis would come 
back. Was indecision what
 to do next. The one thin
g we found out is that 
Alice™s
 
mother and grandmother were both dead, an
d my mother felt te
rribly guilty for the

next 47 years of her life. Nobody could te
ll her that she was sa
ving the food to her 
son, that was a choice between somebody wh
om she didn™t know, and her own son, 
and there was really no choice in the ma
tter. She felt still guilty til the day Œ day of 
her death. I remember that some of the y
ounger people ev aporated first. They didn™t 
ask, they didn™t say anything. We didn™t 
know what happened 
to the people whom 
we knew. My father and moth
er decided th at, around noon
time, that it™s time for us 
to leave. Both my mo ther and father were so weak 
that the little suitcase which we 
had, wh ich contained a half
 a pound of sugar and the family™s pictures, they 
couldn™t carry. I was the one wh o carried th
em, I was the Œ the strongest one. My 
father, who was 43 years old, looked like 
70. And in his two or three weeks of 
patrol, he lost three of his partners, and he
 was more dead than alive. And then he Œ 
we started to walk out of 
the ghetto, that was not Œ no
t an easy walk. There were 
very few walkways there, half of the bui
ldings were on the street. We heard the 
shrapnel zipping and making this awful nois
e above our heads. The artillery fire 
was going on, the Œ the siege of 
Budapest
 was still going on. It 
took us three hours 
to get home, and we decided, like homin
g pigeons, to go back to our home from 
which we were thrown out by
 the Nazis in June of 1944
. We went back, it took us 
three hours, two and a half miles. We saw,
 in that journey, many dead bodies, many 
dead horses, and one live Ru
ssian. Which was almo st ludicrous because this ma n

was singing. He was singing, he wa Œ mu st
 have been drunk, but he Œ he had a 
happy face, he was smiling and singing. And 
we looked at him as if he were crazy, 
instead of the world. Maybe 
he was the ones Œ the only sane people in that Œ person 
in that whole Œ whole mad, maddening s
cene. And as we were walking, these 
shrapnels were hitting buildings, and whol
e walls came down, tumbling in front of 
us. I mean, we were in mortal danger, we Œ we
 were crazy to walk  there, but we did. 
And we walked thro ugh the 
city park, and we were he
ld up by a small group of 
Russians, who wanted us to, for all other 
things, break up th e ice on the sidewalk. I 
mean, breaking up the ice, and he gave 
us these ice pick s to do it. My father 
couldn™t lift it, you know, and he finally said 
well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf 
of bread. That was the first loaf of bread 
we have seen for more
 than a month. It 
was Œ was a square loaf of bread, I reme
mb er. And th ey just let us go. And we 
stumbled home, and it was maybe four, fi
ve in  the afternoon by th e time we got 
there. And the man whom we met first was M r. 
Dudek
(ph). Mr. 
Dudek
(ph) was the 
man who was giving my  father the paper 
under which he was 
able to work for 
years, and who also hid a large suitcase fullof food, which we left with him in June, 

and which he gave back  to us. I rememb er
 th e suitcase was a green suitcase, it was a 
canvas, but it was full of canned fo od. He didn
™t take any. But the rest of the people 
who lived  there were rather frightened. They  
looked at us as if we were ghosts. Not

just because of our physical appearance, 
but because of their 
bad conscious. Here 
these Jews came back. Now what will happ
en? There were Œ we knew about those 
extreme Nazis, Mr. 
Drexler
(ph), who was Œ who was boas
ting about his adventures 
with the Hassidic Jews whos
e Œ whose beard he cut off 
and whose stom
ach he filled 
with Œ with pork. And some
 others, who were no less gu
ilty. They thought they will 
Œ that we were going to denounce them to 
the Russians. We were too tired, too sick 
to Œ too noth ing to Œ to do anything. The 
miracle which happened to  us was that a 
few hours later my Œ my matern al gra
ndmother came h o me. Turned out that she 
was in the ghetto. And reve
nge was the furthest from our minds. My grandmother 
was born in what is now 
Slovakia
, so she spoke the language. Ru ssian troops came 
down , everybody was frightened  of them. We
 found out that they came a few days 
earlier, raped a few women. But my gran
dmother spoke their language and th ey  
were very, very friendly. And I remember th at Mr. 
Dudek
(ph) made room for us, 
and on th e evening of the 18
th
 of January , we s Œ we went to sleep in another 
basement, in another part of town, and the siege of 
Budapest
 was still on. In fact, it 
was still on for more than a month, because 
Buda
 was still defended by the Nazis 
for a month after 
Pest
 was liberated. The life came b
ack slowly. The first thing we 
tried to do is to get some food somewhere.
 My father found a 
rucksack somewhere 
and went out and scrounged for frozen pota
toes, whatever. We ha
d this suitcase full

of food, which helped  a great deal for the 
next few weeks. But of course it doesn™t Œ 
you know, I mean, we were 
Œ my  father was like 90 pounds, my  mo ther was like 
that too and my  grandmother too, and so we
 really needed to eat something. There 
was very little food. There were no utilities.
 Water came about because we were the 
fru Œ we had the ice, you know, in the Œ in
 the yard an d we cut it up and boiled it Œ 
boiled it with water, or whatever. 
Q: What was your physical condition like? 
A: My physical condition was the best of th
e three of us, cause if there was food, I 
ate it. I was weak, but maybe not as weak 
as my  mo th er an d  fa
ther. And I probably 
bounced back in 
a couple of weeks. We lived in 
the basement there, and we were 
trying to  find so me other arrangements. As the end of February ro lled around and 
Buda
 was liberated, people were free to m
ove back up. Ou r old apartment was 
occupied; they gave it to another family
. But the apartment ne
xt door, which was 
the apartment of the 
Surka ™s
(ph), the man who was a professional soldier and 
whose two daughters I used to 
play with, they went to th e west, they left, and their 
apartment was empty. So Mr. 
Dudek
(ph), the super, suggest
ed that we would go 
and occupy that place. At 
that point it was like catche
r™s catch can. A number of 
apartments were also burned 
out by shells. That particul
ar apartment was in fairly 
good shape, so we went up and we occupied it. Many months later, the 
Surkas

came back. There was a law by that time th
at if somebody occupied  an apartment 
for more than a certain number of months
, they were the owners of it. So the
 
Surkas
(ph) couldn™t have a claim. They were
 a sad lot when  they  came back and I 
felt very sorry. The yo Œ the ol
der daughter died. They went
 to the west. The father 
was a soldier, they got liberat
ed and they came back, and 
then they disappeared. I 
don™t know whether they left 
Hungary 
or not, but at that time Œ this was in May or 
June of 1945, and that was the last tim
e I saw them. Our next door neighbors who 
lived in number five, they
 stayed  and Œ and mo st of the neighbors who Œ who Œ 
whom we knew before the wa
r, stayed there. There were 
some new neighbors, some 
people left, but all in all, we had about 20
 apartments in this 
apartment house, about 
15 of them were familiar faces. So what 
happened next? In March, the schools 
opened, and my  mo ther and father and I de
cided that I™m going to go to  the Jewish 
high school. It opened in the Œ what us
ed to be the rabbinic seminary, the old 
build ing wh ich was in 
Aboni
(ph) Street was not givenback at that point. And 
people somehow, and I don™t know how, they
 got the news that it Œ school™s garin Œ 
going to  be open, life is going to start again.
 In the beginning, in March, there were 
no streetcars, so it was like an hour a
nd a half walk each way. My  mo ther Œ 
Q: Was the school in Œ in 
Pest
? 

 
Interview with George Pick

84
A: In 
Pest
. In the middle of 
Pest
. We lived in 
Zu g l ó
, which is sort of outside. Say 
was about a good three miles,
 three and a half miles from 
where the school was. So 
every mo rning we got up fairly early, a
nd my mo ther and I Œ my  mo ther took my  
hand and we walked to the school. And ev
ery Œ and then  she waited for me in front, 
and then  wh en it Œ school was ended, she 
took me back, we had the same  walk. And 
my mother became such a fam
iliar face that th e Œ the teachers all knew her and they 
invited her and then  sort of she said Œ th
ere were some mothers, not all of them 
were like that. But some of 
the mo thers whose sons were all Œ whose Œ this was a 
Jewish gymn asium for boys, boys™ gymnasi
um. We had a girls™ gymnasium also, 
but this was the boys™ gymnasium. And so we
 started out fairly larg e, we had about 
72 students in my class, two 
[indecipherable]
 classes. I  was happy to see some 
friendly fa Œ and Œ faces from the elementa
ry school. But we found out, very  sadly, 
that the Œ the orphans did not surv ive. Wh at
 happened to the or
phans, one day they 
Œ they raided  this orphanage and took ou
t those orphans who were my  classmates, 
10 of them, with the teache
r and took them to the 
Da nube
 and th ey shot them. So 
they didn™t Œ they didn™t 
survive. But many of our 
classmates who were in 
elementary school did,and 
Œ and we saw them Œ I saw them in the gymnasium. It 
was very primitive in the begi
nning, we didn™t have anything, it was just an empty 
school building. And the educ Œ and th Œ 
and many of the teachers didn™t come back

from deportation, or from school yet. They  sort of trickled ba
ck throughout that Œ 
from March to June. That was a very truncat
ed year. It was supposed to start, of 
course, in September of ™44, end in June of
 ™45. Well, it never started, but it ended 
in June of ™45 an yway. And by then , the st
reetcars started to run, and by then life 
started to trickle back. We got a te
legram in early June, I believe, from 
America
, 
from the 
United States
, from my  uncle, the one who want
ed to adopt me, telling us 
that they found us through the Red Cross 
somehow, and that they™ll happy that we 
are survive Œ that we surviv
ed, and th-that he and his wife had a son who was born 
in 1944, and they are fine and happy and we
 should write to th
em, and we did. And 
we started corresponding and th is Œ they se
n Œ they said they 
would send us papers. 
But my father decided ag
ainst it. He felt that 
Hungary
 is going to be a good 
country now. And indeed, after the war th
ere were some possibilities. My father 
restarted his business. It looked like ther
e was going to be a demo cracy. People 
were Œ were having some hope. Many of 
the surviving Jews d
ecided to join  the 
communist party, my  father and mo ther jo
ined the social demo
crats.  And some of 
the people were out for revenge. Many of 
them decided to join
 the political police 
and they were after the Nazis. 
Kormus
(ph), for example surv
ived, became a head 
of a people™s court, and as such, his 
mi ssion was to put away as ma ny Nazis as 
possible. And he accomplished it. My father
 was not that kind, and my mother was

neither, and we sort of tried to reconstr
uct whatever we could. We looked around 
the neighborhood, we found that some of our furniture
 was not do Œ too far from 
where it originated from, and we got it back
 from the neighbors. And we just tried 
to rebuild our lives, somehow. 
Q: By that time, when you 
had gotten your strength back  
and had fo od and so forth 
and school had started, by then  did 
you feel free, and feel liberated? 
A: In a sense, yes. I think it took me a l
ong time to really feel liberated. Probably 
1946. I remember 1945, and I remember th e 
first of May of 1945,
 which was a huge 
demonstration by the social demo crats 
and the communists. And I rememb er the 

struggle, the political struggles. 
Q: You Œ you mean a 
May Day celebration? 
A: May Day celebration and the political stru
ggles for power. I now also knew that 
most of the communist leaders who came back from 
Moscow
 were Jewish. 
Rocco 
Shagerra
(ph), 
Farkosh
(ph). And most of the Jews 
were not unsympathetic. Some 
of them were. Obviously the Œ the ones 
who were rich before, saw that the 
communists are not going to retain them as
 Œ as capitalists again. But my family 
was never really rich. My father was a Œ an 
engineer, he figured he
 would be able to 
do business, he would be able
 to find a job, and we were not very worried. In fact, 
in 1945, 
Dudek
(ph) Œ my father was able to reward 
Dudek
(ph) and 
Dudek
(ph) not

only saved some of our food, but he also 
saved some of my father™s material, y ou 
know, ma Œ business, and so  my  father gave
 him half of it, and they  started out a 
business, a little business 
right in the building. 
Dudek
(ph) was not a good 
busin essman, so he Œ he didn™
t do very well, but my  father
 was, and Œ and he started 
to deal with the same people he dealt 
with du Œ befo re the war. And it was a good 
time. I mean, inflation was there for sure
, but there were possibilities. And these 
possibilities ended in 1947. What were th
e possibilities? Well, one was, you know, 
we were Jewish and the Joint from the 
United States
 had sent food and things, 
clothing. I remember in 19 Œ I believe it 
was the summer of ™46, an d I went to a 
camp which was run by the Jo
int and Zionists. And I was 
not a Zionist myself. We 
had a lot of Zionists in our Œ in our school
, and many of the teachers were Zionists, 
and they  had socialist 
Zionists, such as the 
Hashomer Ha tzair
, and then they  had 
Orthodox. And one of the things which 
bothered me is that there was some 

animosity and definite anim
osity between both  the teachers and the students who 
were of various persuasions. I rememb er
 a particular teacher who didn™t like 

Orthodox Jews and who hit them, hit their 
heads, to hit their hats off and Œ and 

things like that, and I could never unders
tand it. After ™44, how could a Jew hit 
another Jew because the Jew wears a hat?
 And there were some very passionate 
discussions about, you know, 
Hash omer Hatzair
 and 
Irgun
 and all these others.

And 
Beta r
 and Œ and whoever else. And some 
people who were or
phans Œ many of 
my  students Œ fellow students were orphans, moved in to these Zionist camp s, these 
little Œ they had houses. And they lived like 
Œ like Œ they were to
ld that they were 
like adults, I mean, 13 - 14 year old kids, th
ey were adults, they could do anything 
they wanted  to. And I was fortunate enough to have my  parents, and in a sense I 

was a little bit jealous that th
ey could do anything
 and I wasn™t. I was still a son, and 
I was still a child. And despite ™44, you kno
w, I Œ in a sense I reverted back to 
childhood. I couldn™t accompli Œ 
completely in a hundred percent, but Œ but largely, 
and I was expected to. And I was expected 
to forget about all those things. And it 
been Œ and it had been bothering me 
for a long time, you know, what do you 
reme mb er, how could you re
member, you were too young. And th e authenticity of 
these remembrances were always questione
d, not by me, but by others. But life 
went on and we were told, you know, that 
we shouldn™t dwell on the Holocaust, we 
shouldn™t dwell on this. We shouldn™t Œ 

Q: When  you say we were told, you mean
 your parents told you that, or other 
people told you? 
A: My parents told me, but mo stly ot
her people, and the Œ and th Œ and th e 
newspapers, and the Œ an-and
 the school, you know, now 
you have to learn, now 
you are back  to school. Now you worr
y about your homework , now you wo rry

about your exams. Now you do  things. You know, we join
ed first the Boy Scouts, 
and then  wh en the Boy Scouts were disban
ded, the Yo ung Pioneers. And there was 
always something to do. There was some ex
citement too, I mean, how did we Œ how 
did we build Œ rebuild our liv
es? What do we Œ what di
d we do? Ho w did we do it? 
And as I mentioned, I was taken to one of
 these camps, Zionist camps, I was Œ we 
had four languages in the same time, and 
I was never a good linguistic expert. We 
had Hebrew , Latin, English, and for a while
 German, but then that was dropped. 
But three languages were more than eno
ugh for me, and I was not very good in 
either of those. And the onl
y way I could not flunk Hebrew
 is that the Œ I promised 
my Hebrew teacher that I was going to go 
to a Zionist camp. An
d they took me and 
I was unhappy and I s Œ I escaped. I escap
ed after about a week. Went home, my 

father was very upset with me. He felt that
 I was just a coward, that I just couldn™t 
do it. I disagreed with  him. But these th
ings were not for me, I was Œ I was too 
much of a mother™s boy still, and I was s
till with my mother. 
I was only 12 years 
old, I mean, it™s not that I was Œ and th is camp was not exactly wh at you would call 

a camp here, it was hard. And we didn™t 
get that much food, and the food was 
mostly split pea soup, whic
h reminded me of the ghetto
, which was the only food 
there. But I had friends, and I started to 
Œ to  form relationships. But I didn™t have 
too many friends of my own age. The buildi
ng we le Œ lived in had a Œ a numb er of

young girls who were older than I was. I wa
s always attracted to young girls, and I 
was Œ these young girls were 16 - 17 - 18. 
And I was more mature than my age and 
I started to have Œ sort of strike up co
nversations with  them. And I thought that I 
was enough of an intellectual challenge to Œto talk to, to be ta
lked to. And our next 
door neig hbor was a Œ her name was 
Miriam
. She was not Jewish, she was 16 and 
she was telling me about the 
facts of life, and there was 
another girl down stairs who 
was Œ she was Œ her Œ her name was 
Maurika
(ph) and she was 18 and she was a 
very studious girl and we 
had nice, interesting convers
ation about Œ conversations 
about literature and art and music and things
 like that. Of course, they all had their 
boyfriends, but I sort of fancied myself
 as being so mehow a surroga Œ surrogate 
boyfriend and Œ and was there. And so  my  
Œ my Œ my life, my social life sort of 
started to evolve among these people, my
 neighbors. And many of my  friends, too. 
And then  I got involved  
in the Young Pioneers, and some other various 
organizations. There was one organization,
 Young Workers. They were usually 
three, four years older than I was, and th
ey were not Jewish. And once I got into a Œ 
a real fight with them, and they told me 
that I was just a dirty little Jew, and they 
chased me out and chased me to Œ through th
e streets. A nd I Œ sort of it occurred to 
me that, my God, you know, 
these people are the same. Th
ey are not Œ they are not 
different any more. They are just the same
. They are still calling me dirty Jew two

years after the war, and they are still ch
asing me down the street. And then I had 
some doubts whether it was a good idea to stay in Œ in  
Hungary
. But these doubts 
were not, at this point were
 not very bad and very pron
ounced . This was 1947. We 
had a Œ an election and the communists 
came in distant fourth. We still had a 
demo cratic government. 
Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah? 

A: I had a Bar Mitzvah. My Bar Mitzva
h was an interesting one. It Œ in 
Budapest
 
there were two orphanag es, a girl orpha
nage and a boy orpha
nage. The girl or-
orphanage was very close to 
wh ere we lived, so Œ and they had, of course, a shul. 
And Rabbi 
Schwartz
 was the rabbi there, and he in
structed me. In 
1947, I had the 
Bar Mitzvah there. And my  mo ther decided 
that I would have a Bar Mitzvah lunch, 
and well, what can you do with
 a lu Œ fo r a lunch, you know? I invited the following 
people; there were a couple of communist 
kids in school, they were about three 
years older than I was, but they were 
friends. And there was a fellow who was a 
friend of mine who was sort of a li
terary guy. And then a few friends, 
contemporaries. And I borro wed two girls fro
m the orphanage, th
ey came also. And 
we had a very nice lunch, and th e adults 
were in the other room. That was my Bar 
Mitzvah. And I remember, I got a book, wh
ich I still have. It™s in Hungarian, of 
course. It™s about Jewish Middle Ages. It™s ab out 
Spa in
, the Spanish Jewish Middle

92
Ages. And it was by 
Ro th
, Sir ce Œ Sir 
Cecile Roth
, famous historian. I didn™t read 
the book, it was way above my 
head at that time, but for some reaso n  or another, I Œ 
I got it Œ my mother got it out of 
Hungary
, and I found it many years later and I 
read it with much interest, and I still have
 it. My Bar Mitzvah present. And then a 
stupid th ing happened. A friend of mine wa
s tackling me in school, right after my 
Bar Mitzvah and pushing me back and my  shin  broke. And so , I missed about two 
weeks or three weeks of class. I w as in 
a cast for six weeks. 
And after the cast my 
father and mother decided th
at I should go to a camp, 
a real camp . And they  send 
me to this camp, which was run by Jews
. Was run by a Olympic Œ Jewish Olympic 
wrestling champion by the name of 
Ka rpa thi
(ph), and it was called a 
Karpathi
(ph) 
camp, it was a sports camp . And mo st of th
e kids were Jewish and I had a great time 
there. And it was three weeks. I didn™t esca
pe there Œ from there. I learned how to 

bike again, because for some reaso n  I fo

those things; how to dance. There was a 
girl there who was

Karpathi

 Kerienyi

became friends and even after the camp I 
saw  her many times and then we lost in 
touch maybe a half a year or so later. Fi
ve years passed by, and I me t her again. 
And I™m going to cut this story, because 
there will be some significance at that 
point. But now we are still in
 1947 Œ 1947 and 1948. I had a happy education, 
particularly in one particular subject, wh
ich was history. My homeroom teacher and 
my history teacher was one and the 
same, he was a young ma-man named 
Paul 
Poch
(ph). He turned  out to be one of the great historians of
 Hungary
, and he was 
very young man and he Œ one of his claim to
 fame was that he was also the director 
of the statistical survey 
run by th e Joint, of the 
[indecipherable]
 remnants. And you 
find a copy of the book in our library. Wh
at they did is 400 
people, in 1945, in 
August of ™45, went th
rough every building of 
Buda pest
 and found the 
[indecipherable]
 remnants of Œ of Jews in 
Budapest
. Found 68,000 of them. There 
were Œ there were probably more, but many 
of them did not want to be registered. 

My family and I were Œ my family™s name
 and my  name were Œ are in the book. 
Poch
(ph) was the one who did it.
 Besides that, he was a brilliant teacher and he was 
my homeroom teacher for four years, 
and I wanted to be a historian. 
Poch
(ph) left 
the school because he became a profe
ssor, a full professor 
at age 28 in the 
University of 
Buda pest
 in the Œ the economic university of 
Budapest
. A few years 
later he became the Œ the dean, and a few ye
ars after that he became director. Then

he became a absolute world class historian.
 The one thing which 
he did however, is 
that he completely changed his point 
of view, he became a Marxist economic 
historian. And he wa Œ he
 became one of their authority. And Œ but he was a 
humane person, and one of the interesting part
 was that one of the classes he taught 
in the Jewish high school, who graduated in
 1948 - ™49, of that class, three men 
went to his Œ his faculty. They became very
 famous historians. One of them became 
the president of the Academy 
of Sciences, his name is 
Ivan Berendt
. He came to 
this country, he™s now a professor of history in  
UCLA
, and 
Poch
(ph) helped him 
and helped  others. Helped 
one man by the name of 
Ra nkey
(ph), who became a Œ a 
Œ an authority on Hu ngarian Ho lo caust.

A: I was saying that 
Ra nkey
(ph) was not a communist. He was Œ he became a 
Holocaust expert, historian. And because
 of that his Œ his career during the 
communist ye-years was really jeopardized. 
Poch
(ph) helped him a great deal, and 
he helped others. So although 
Poch
 became a communist, he was still a Œ a great 
human being and help ed a great deal of Œ 
great many men and people in their Œ in

their career. So I must say that I am pers
onally very  thankful 
to him and grateful, 
because for one, he taught me the love of
 history, which is Œ which I wanted to 
become my  Œ my  profession. Thankfully 
wh ich did not become my  profession, but 
a lifeti me h o bby. 1948, 
Poch
(ph) leaves and a number of other teachers leave the 
school. Passover, 
Pesach
, nine four Œ 1948. We say go
odbye to many of our friends 
who went to a camp, Zionist camp. After 
Pesach
, our s Œ our class of 38 became 
class of 13. The rest of the people left
. We found that they  went through the 
Bricha 
lea
(ph) to 
Israel
. Many of them are still there. And 
we stayed Œ I wasn™t a Zionist Œ 
with this small, shrinking cl
ass. They combined
 the other class with us, which also 
shrunk, and of the 72 people, we had now a 
class of roughly 30, a comb ined class of 
30. We had other teachers. So
me teachers left with the 
Bricha
, some teachers 
stayed. I became very intere
sted in acting. We had 
a little acting group in our 
school. I became interested. We had put on 
full three act p lays. My father became 
interested in this school. He wanted to he
lp the school. He found
 out that the school, 
of course, lost mo st of its labs, and he wa
nted  to raise money, so he figured a Œ a 
way to ask famous performers to come
 to the school fo r nothing, and have 
fundraisings. And he became 
involved in many of these kinds of fu ndraisings. And 
you would not believe the mo
st famous singers came to 
sing; Jews and non-Jews 
alike, and they are always sold out perfo
rmances, and my father was really a great

 and Œ and got enough money 
to rebuild the physics and 
biological libr Œ labs. And in 1950 or ™51,
 they dedicated a greenhouse on th e top of 
the building which my father raised m
oney for. And so  my father became the 
president, or the 
P.T.
 and then my mother was very 
involved and I became involved 
with the Œ on a student level. And it was fro
m ™48 to ™50 - ™52. 
They were Œ despite 
of the fact that Œ that there were Œ th-t
here were terrors, and 
Œ and Œ and wo rsening 
political situation and crisis
, there was an island there. The school became a Œ a 
separate island, wh ere we had a dicono Œ 
dichotomy where we shared both what we 
needed  to share, su
ch as you know, what you need ed 
to talk about, you know, the 
great communist camp, and the 
[indecipherable]
 the imperialist camp and all this 
phraseolo gy, wh ich we had to also say, 
but then we talked 
about what was the 
Voice of 
America
 saying, you know? So it was a real
ly funny, ironic situation. The 
same people who were parroting the phrase
ology were talking about the Voice of 
America
. And the teachers who had to parr
ot the phraseology also, Marxist 
phraseolo gy, wh ich they didn™t believe in
, who were Hebrew teachers before he 
beca Œ they became Marxist, quote unquote,
 teachers, who were teaching Yiddish  
instead of Russian, which 
they ended up teaching fo
r a while, you know? These 
teachers knew that this is a big joke, that
 nobody believes in th
is, but we pretended 
that something had to be done, 
and Œ and we did. Except for Œ

Q: Di-Did th e tighten ing of the govern ment
, or what you had to
 do, did that bring 
back any memories of the war? 
A: Well, it certainly did. Of course, the 
Œ the tightening of the government, and the 
Œ the loss of rights brought back  a lot of 
memories. And people who were deported 
during th e Holo caust, were deported again. 
This time not because they were Jewish, 
but because they were
 capitalists, and capitalists couldn™t live in 
Budapest
, so they 
took the Œ took away their Œ 
their homes and they deported 
them to the countryside.  
Q: Did th at make you mo re nervous? 

A: It absolutely did, but there was no choi
ce in the matter now, of course, that the 
Iron Curtain was shut. In 1948, after the 
Bricha
, and very shortly thereafter when 
the communists took power, thin gs were over. 
And by then, of course, those of us 
who recognized too late, and 
too belatedly that we were pretty stupid again, we 
were there. So what coul
d you do, you know? Well, wh
at you could do was what 
we did, which is to go al
ong outwardly, and go to  th
e May celebrations and the 
Novemb er celebrations, and at the same  time talk about 
BBC 
and Radio Free 
Euro pe
 and trying to keep each ot
her in Œ in a Jewish era. We were Œ we were still 
studying Œ not legally at
 this point Œ Jewish things, Jewish history. 
Q: Did you feel more Jewish no
w than you had many years ago?

A: Abso lutely. In the next Œ in the firs
t two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium 
meant that we were not studying, we were 
Œ we do not have Saturd ay classes, but 
instead we had to go to the 
synagogue. So  we did. That
 wasn™t a pleasant thing for 
me, I was n ever a synagogue goer. But it 
made me want to know more Jewish 
history. It made me much more of a 
conscious Jew. And after the communist 
takeover, the synagogue
 
was closed, we couldn™t Œ the 
Œ th e Œ the synagogue of the 
Œ the gymnasium was closed, it was no longe
r there. So Œ but Œ but we still had 
some spark, and Œ and many times the spar
k was nothing mo re than, I know you are 
Jewish and you know th at I am Jewish, 
and you can trust me. And that was not 
always the case, unfortunately, although I 
think we always knew whom we could 
trust, within the school. We knew that th
ere were a few people wh o Œ who we could 
not, including teachers. And this
 came to a head in 1950. 
In 1950, there was a letter, 
which was drafted by a teacher and a studen
t, which was circulated  in the school, 
demanding of the government of nationaliz
ing our school. And they  tried to 
intimidate the students and the teachers. A
nd it came to a head because there was a 
conference, a te Œ a teacher-student-paren
t conference. And it was supposed to be a 
secret letter, but somebody told that Œ th
e principal of wh at was going on. And this 
Œ all hell broke loose. And I was there a
nd I rememb er. There was a parent of a 
classmate o f mine whose Œ who told the 
students and the teacher, who did not want 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
99
to identify himself, that they
 are cowards, they are da
mn cowards, and they are 
traitors. And it was really embarrassing b
ecause this was a communist inspired 
thing, you know. And this wa
s toward the end of the sch
ool year, and in the next 
school year, we had from 200 students, 
to 45, including the t
eacher who was Œ who 
Œ whom we found out was a Œ was a defect
or. And he left, he became a principal 

somewhere else, and all these students. But 
I stayed, and 45 of us
 stayed. Our class 

of 30 became a class of 13. This was our 
sixth grade, it was junior high school. And 
we stayed, and we became more Jewish, a
lthough outwardly we could do less. We 
couldn™t talk about Jewish history. We co
uldn™t talk about Jewi
sh things. But we 
could talk about books written by 
Stefan Zw eig 
and 
Berfer
(ph). And we could 
sabotage learning Russian, 
for example. An ex-rabbi
 
was teaching us Russian, who 
did not know from Russian from a hole in 
the head. I mean, he was always a Œ a 

lesson ahead of us, but that was it. And Œ a
nd we took this as a 
joke, inside. But we 
realized mo re and more, and more and more
 keenly that this island for us, is going 
to come to an end. And th
en wh at? And that end came in 1952, when I graduated. 
Now one of the motivations of the Œ all 
of my classmates who left, was that 
nobody™s going to be
 accepted in a university from a 
parochial school such as the 
Jewish gymnasium. That wa
s the motivation why they le
ft. It turned out very 
ironically, that out of the tw
o Œ four Œ 13 of us who gr
aduated, 11 of us were 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
100
accepted. Because the regime in 1952 wanted 
to show the world th
at there was such 
a thing as religious freedom. Much less of
 the people who left were accepted, 
percentage-wise. The only two who were no
t, were bad students,
 period, who didn™t 
even want to go to school. I was accepte
d. And here came the big shock. The big 
culture shock, because I wa
s trusting to the university
, the technical university, 
Budapest
, where we had a class o f 1200 peop
le, from 13 to 1200. And we had this 
huge theater and we were sitting there,
 you know, men and 
women. And I found 
myself in Œ very much in a minority. This
 was the year where it made a difference 
who™s Œ who your parents were; if your pare
nts were peasants or workers, you got 
accepted regardless of your qualifications
. If your parents were businessmen, you 
wat Œ you were rejected. My father was in
-between, and I sort of, because he was a 
Œ what they call an intellectual, or a prof
essional, that was not well thought of, but it 
was better t h an a businessman 
for sure. My father wasn™t
 a businessman by then , he 
work ed fo r another comp any. And so in Œ I 
was able to slip in on this, but I found 
my colleagues to be very different from 
me. The chemistry wo
rked there. Very 
quickly we found from 
each other Œ o-of each other, wh
o were Jewish. Of the f Œ of 
the 1200, roughly 
about 150 of us were Jewish, wh
ich was a large percentage. And 
as I says, the magic of chemistr
y, I mean, we didn™t know from 
Adam
. We found 
us, each other and we drifted toward each
 other. The way the school were Œ was 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
101
divided up, we
 had subspecialties within mechan
ical engineering Œ this was only 
mechanical engineering. We had specialtie
s o n  textile engineering, shipbuilding, 
whatever else. And in my subspecialty, wh
ich was naval archy Œ naval architecture, 
we had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of th
em were not. And we were 
sort of drifting in and out. I was Œ I was ne
ver really very friendly with these people 
because their culture, their Œ 
their interests w ere very di
fferent from me. I felt sorry 
for them because they 
were not really qualified and they
 were really struggling with 
the material. They didn™t kn
ow elementary algebra wh en they had to learn calculus, 
and they  really had a heck of a hard  time, 
alth ough the regime gave them all sorts of 
scholarships and stuff. I have to step back
 now because there is a Œ an important 
thing wh ich happened in my  life, right be
fo re graduation, personally. And that Œ 
what happened was that I fell
 in love, 18 years old. This was right before graduation 
in February of 1952. Fell in love with a 
young girl who didn™t understand my  Œ my  
feelings, and I was very brokenhearted wh
en my feelings were not reciprocated. 
And I was so brokenhearted that I fell si
ck. They thought I ha
d mononucleosis and 
other diseases and I was in the hospital fo
r a month. And this was in February - 
March of ™52, just befo re graduation. And 
my wa Œ mother and father were worried 
that I was going to se Œ lose that year. 
But my  colleagues were very nice and they  
brought me up to date very f Œ very fast. 
Then  Ap ril roll Œ rolled along, and walking

on the street, in a nice, bright, April after
noon, I met this girl who was very familiar. 
Made a long story short, it was the girl, 
Judith Kerienyi
(ph),
 
whom I met five 
years earlier in a camp. Then we started 
to talk, she was, at this point, just 
graduating from college. She became a si
nger, she never married. Didn™t marry the 
Œ broke off with the fiancé, and she was si
ngle. I was 18, she was 22 - 23. And it 
was a roma nce, and it was maybe an antidot
e to the love, the unrequited love I had 
before. It became a very hot romance, not 
to my mother™s liki
ng and my father™s 
liking, who felt that I should
 really learn and study. The way it went in our school 
system is that we finished the school ear
ly, in May, and then we had six weeks of 
real study, after which we had a five hour oral exam. And it was almo st like a 
PhD
 
thing. And the six weeks we supposed to cr
am in everything we
 need to know about 
the oral. And we had these little 
[indeciphera ble]
 things, they had hundreds of 
questions. We knew the questions, we just 
needed to learn the answ ers. Of course, 
that was the trick, you know, you can™t le
arn eight years of answers in two months. 
You really had to learn some other things
. Bu t at that point, you know, the Œ the 
summer was full blown and Œ an d I was too 
interested in Œ in Œ in everything, 
mostly 
J udith
, and less interested  in the study. But I studied a little. And Œ and it 
was just the hottest romance we had. It wa
s sort of crazy. The 
Œ her parents worked , 
my  parents work ed, so both of our apartm
ents were vacant dur
ing the day and we 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
103
took advantage of it. And it was my  real 
Œ first real romance. I mean, I had some 
sex before, but they were occasional type th
ings, mostly prostitutes. This was really 
a woman. I didn™t know wh at Œ and sh e di
dn™t know how to handle it either. Which 
was too bad because she was 22, I was 18. 
If I didn™t know how to handle it, well, 
that was something, but she Œ she should
 have known better. Made a longer story 
short, she became pregnant, and of course, 
my father and I didn™t see eye to eye 
through this. I wanted to marry her, of c
ourse, it was moral obligation. My fa Œ my 
mother told me the same. My
 father said absolutely not
, I am Œ you are a minor. In 
Œ in 
Hungary
 you were a minor until 21, and I™m
 not giving your permission and 
that™s that. Make the long story short, we
 didn™t marry and she had an abortion. And 
there is a letter which I still posse
ss, which my mother wrote to 
Judith
, where it 
was a woman to woman letter; a v ery sad on
e, in fact. And saying that, you know, 
she understands the Œ the pain an d the sorro
w. But she has to understand that I am 
too young and I am just starting my  Œ my
 schooling, and she should have known  
better. And that romance stayed with me fo
r a long time. That was really a very 
poten t one in many different respects, and I ne
ver forgot it. It was a happy ending, if 
you want, because she had an abortion, 
and then she got married and she has 
children. No thing bad happened  to  her. Bu
t perhaps I am kidding myself, I don™t 
know. And I went on to scho
ol, and I had this Œ and I ha
d another girlfriend about a

104
year later, who was more to my level of in
terest maybe, and same age as I was. And 
the shock went on for four years, from 19
52 to ™56. I had the 
same girlfriend this 
time, 
Erica
 was her name. And we had a tempestuous relationship. But there was a 
Œ there was something important which happ
ened, not just with
 her but with my  
circle of Œ small circle of fri
ends. We still kept going to Œ 
to Œ to operas. We went to 
theater. We kept a cultural core, which the 
country in  itself did not, you know, they 
Œ they so rt of sank into this 
Bo lshev ik 
slide. But we kept a western level of culture, 
and I think that kept our humanity, too, in
 a Œ in a great degree. Between 1952 and 
™56, times were hard, and I wa
s work ing very hard 
in Œ in school, trying to earn my 
college tuition, wh ich I did. We were not ri
ch, and I really needed to work. In the 
summertime, I did. I went to Œ this was not
 my  choice, I had to do wo rk once Œ one 
month ev ery summer, work  Œ we got paid  Œ in  industry. And one month every 

summer, we had to go to the Œ to th e army
. And I had a hard time in the army, I 
mu st tell you. Bo th Œ I had three su mmers 
which I had to go to th e army , and all 
those three summers w ere very, very hard 
for me, I was n o t cut out to be a soldier. 
And that in is Œ in itself a story of itself, 
but I™m not going to go in th ere. Fifty-six 
came around. The winds of change started to
 be felt, and then tragedy struck. My 
father all of a sudden got sick and died. 
He got celebra Œ cerebral hemo rrhage. He 
was a chain smoker, and finally got to him.
 This was at the end of March, right

105
during my  period of ex ams, final exams. 
And I was very scared, and I didn™t know 
how to handle it. I was 22. I had a ve
r Œ a very  good friend, his name was 
Dionege
(ph) 
Brock
(ph), he was stud Œ he was studying to  be a rabbi; in fact, he was 
already a Œ an ordained rabbi
 and I asked him what he th inks, wh at he thought. He 
knew 
Erica
 very  well, he knew me very well. He
 was a very, very close friend. He 
sort of said look, I thin
k you should  pull togeth er. You should have a better Œ a 
bigger family. You should really be not 
one Œ I mean you Œ my family, my real 
family was not very close knit, particularly 
after my fath er died. 
In fact, even in the 
last few years before my father died, my mo
ther and fath er sort of drifted apart, and 
I drifted apart from my father. And I drif
ted Œ the only person I had close was my  

mo ther. I had a couple of cousin s I wa
sn™t that friendly with. My maternal 
grandmother died. My paternal grandparen
ts still had this family gathering every 
Sunday, but after 18 I didn™t want to go. I found th em strange, I had nothing to say 
to them. So here, after my father died, I 
had literally very few people to go to. And I 
was scared, so 
Erica™s
 family, she had a sister and mo
ther, father; th ey were very 
nice people, I liked them, and I liked 
Erica
. And Œ and essentially
 I felt that maybe 
this is the time when
 Œ when  I should have my  own,
 and then I engaged Œ I became 
engaged to  her. And we had an engagement 
in Au gust. And we were planning to get 

married after I graduated from school, wh ich wa
s at the fall of 1956. It was going to

be in October of ™56. And in fact, in Octo
ber of ™56 Œ I just comp leted my  last exam 
on th e 22
nd
 of October. The 23
rd
 of October became a notab
le day, but for me the 
22
nd
 was the Œ the real clincher. There was 
a meeting late in the afternoon, right 
after my exam, where I went to, student m
eeting, which lasted 
until three o™clock in 
the morning, and which, at 
the end, we declared that 
Hungary
 must be an 
independent state and should declare neut
rally Œ neutrality and the Ru ssians, we 
demanded the Ru ssians get out. A
nd we agreed that on the 23
rd
 in the morning, we 
would all come back to th
e university and we wouldhave a Œ a demonstration. 
Came October 23
rd
, I went to the university, we 
waited until late afternoon, we 
finally got permission for the de
monstration. I was there in 
Parliament 
Square, and 
then I went home and then the sh ooting war 
started. I went back  to the university 
about a week later, and I participated in 
some of the Œ the skirmishes which had 
happened  th ere. Novemb er second, th
e Ru ssian tanks rumb led through our 
neighborhood. 
Q: Wh-When you say you par
ticipated, what did that

I felt that it was 
futile, and at that point I wanted to stay alive, I d Œ I didn™t go out to shoot any 
more.  
Q: Ho Œ and seeing the Russians coming in 
in  their tanks, did that trigger any 
memories for you? 
A: It did, it certainly did, th-the memory
 of that March Sund
ay, when the Germans 
Œ German tanks came in the very same route,
 toward the Œ the cen
ter of the city, and 
that Œ that memory also triggered that, you know, wh at is happening here is Œ is 

history repeating itself, or not. But there 
was not very mu ch time for thinking here, 
because there was a war going 
on and for two weeks there was a Œ a real fighting. I 
mean, at that point we went Œ ev erybo
dy from the build ing wh ere we lived wh en 
down to the basement, just lik
e we had in 1944, and ™45. 
It was artillery duels. And 
by November, by the 20
th
 of Novemb er, the inside of the downto wn  was comp letely 
demo lished again. I me an, 10 years after 
the war, the downto wn  area looked just 
like it did in 1945. Twenty-second of Novemb
er Œ oh, during th is period of time, we

are listening to radio free 
Europe
 and a voice of 
America
. And I was particularly 
appalled by the fact that I was sitting in  
Elizabeth 
Street, in a basement, while a 
bunch of people are already sending messages from 
Austria
 to their relatives, 
saying that they are already in 
Austria
 and they don™t know 
whether they are going 
to 
Australia
 or 
Canada
 yet. And I™m sitting as Œ like a rat in a basement in 
Budapest
. And I, just to mys Œ I am saying to
 myself, I mean, how many mistakes 
can I make? I mean, my moth
er and father made enough mistakes. I™m not going to 
make the same. So, on the spur of the mo me
nt, I called my fiancée and a friend, that 
in the next morning we are going to meet in 
[indeciphera ble]
 railroad station and 
then we™ll see what happens. And I bicycl
ed there, because there was nothing else. 
Said goodbye to my mo
ther. The decision took all of a ha
lf an hour, and in the next 
morning we met at the railroad station. We
 had a vague plan, which is to go to a 
border town  and then  feel our way around. We
 never got there. After the Œ the Œ this 
is chaos now, there is no central govern
ment. The Ru ssians are occupying part of 
the country, not all of it. There is s
till fighting going on in
 the countryside. 
Railroads have no schedule, government 
is nonexistent. People are doing their 
thing. Obviously a lot of them are alrea
dy outside of the country. The train was 
comp letely packed , maybe a thousand peop
le. And shortly after we started, we 
found out that most of the 
thousand people had the same  
idea, to go to the western

border and get out. We were told that it™s 
dangerous to keep maps, so we thro wed 
the maps away. I had a couple of things
 in my  pocket, two overcoats and a few 
other thin gs. Couple of pieces of jewelr
y sewn into my pock
et and who knows who 
to bribe, how to do whatever is
 going to happen. We had no idea. 
Q: What™s it like to ma ke decisions your
self? Previously, in the war, it was your 
parents who made the decisions. 
A: Well, it Œ I was 22 years old and I felt 
that in the war I made a few decisions 
which saved my  life, and I am not going to  stay around. I knew th at some people 

knew that I was participating in the fightin
g. I knew that the Ru ssians are not going 
to be very merciful fo r those who were 
participating. I could end up in jail, or 
worse. So I didn™t have much of a choice a
nd I really wanted to leave. I Œ I thought 
this was the mo st psychologically opport une moment in the world for me. I had 

comp leted my  undergraduate education, and 
here is an opportun
ity I would Œ would 
pay, you know, I would take wh atever chan
ces there was. To make the long story 
short, the train never reached the to wn  wh
ere we went to. It stopped in a smaller 
town , some 20 Œ 25 miles from the border. 
We slept there, and the very next 
morning went to the station, we got into a 
cattle train. The cattle train stopped in the 
middle of the day, in the middle of nowher
e, and then  we walked for two days, and 
ended up at the border. And I didn™t like th
e situation very mu
ch, because in the 

 
Interview with George Pick

border there was some  fighting at night. So 
I told my fiancée and our Œ our friend to 
Œ we are moving back. We m
oved back to a small villag e
. I met a Œ we met a fellow 
who told  us that he would 
help us the very next mo rn
ing, because he knew a way. 
And we also told him to go 
back  to our parents and see if they would be able to 
come out. The next mo rning we went out bri
ght, early mo rning, a
nd he told us that 
between those two haystacks, if we stay 
between them it™s okay. That haystack Œ 
beyond that haystack are the Russian, be
yond that haystack are the Hungarian 
communists, but in-between is okay. And that
™s what we did, we went in between. 
The only problem was that right before no ma
n™s land, there was a quarter of a mile 
of completely cleared land, and behind 
that there were towers, watch towers. 
Q: Do you think y
our experience during th e war 
helped you get through this? 
A: Probably. I do not know. At that point
 I was only thinking ab out the now and the 
then. Th-The moment. We knew that we ha
d to go Œ go th rough. We knew that we 
also had an excellent chance 
of being shot in the back 
from the watchtowers. We 
also knew that in front of us, wh ich used to  be a minefield, the mines were removed 
a few months before, and we
 have no other barrier. And this was the chance. And I 
think there are some points in life when  one does not think too mu ch , and hesitate 
too much, because if one does, one gets para
lyzed. So what I just did, I started to 
curse in Hungarian, started to yank my fiancé
e as fast as I could. We ran though this

part, and it took us probably  all of two mi
nutes, but it il Œ seemed like an hour. And 
then we were there, we were Œ we were
 in no-man™s land, we saw the Austrian 
flags, and we were on the other side, a
nd then in about five minutes later, the 
Austrian border patrol intercepted us. We 
didn™t speak the language, but they  didn™t 
want. Turned out, wh
en we ww-went to 
Lutzmannsdorf
, which was the first little 
town, is that the night befo
re, the border police all defe
cted, and so nobody was up 
there, but I didn™t know that
. So my Œ my luck was still 
Œ still with me. And then the 
very next day, the Joint came to 
Eisenstaedt
, which was the next largest city. They 
took us to 
Linz
. It was already organized, all the hotels in 
Linz
, which was 
Hitler™s 
hometown, were reserved for the Jews, and 
that was an ironic twist of fate. It was 
Wiesenthal
 Œ I don™t know if you know the name 
Wiesenthal
, 
Simon Wiesenthal
, 
who was in charge of th at operation. We 
had hundreds of Hungarian  Jews there. 
The non-Hu ngarian Œ Hungaria
n non-Jews were thrown in
to a camp, and we were 
there for three weeks. Mean
while, the Joint fed us and 
paid our hotel room. There 
came recruiters from 
C a na da
 and from the 
United States
. When they found out 
that I was an engineer, young engineer, 
they said absolutely, you should come. 

When they found ou
t that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all. And three 
weeks later, on the 19
th
 of December of 1956, our
 plane touched down in 
Newark
, 
and we went to Camp  
Kilmer
, and a day later I was in 
New York City
.

Q: How did you feel putting your
 foot down on American soil? 
A: Well, it was unreal. We had a 
30 hour flight. We stopped in 
Reykjavik
 Œ in 
Reykjavik
, 
Iceland
, we were in 
Scotland
, we were in 
Labrador
. Not the jet 
planes, th-they Œ they  had no jet planes in
 ™56. It was a Œ it was an exhaustive Œ 
exhausting trip because the night before 
we started, we alre
ady were 
going Œ we 
originally  were going from 
Linz
 to 
Salzburg
, and in 
Salzburg
 we didn™t have a 
place, so they sent us back to 
Linz
, and from 
Linz
 to 
Muenchen
(ph). And so we 
were on a bus for 14 or 15 hours before we 
had the 30 hour flight. So  I was sort of 
in no-man™s land. There was one thing wh
ich happened a day before we left, which 
was very important. We visited 
Mauthausen
. This was an inoculation against 
Euro pe
 and against any kind of Œ 
of Œ of wanting to  go back  to the old Œ to  the old 
Œ to the old country.

Beginn ing Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
George Pick
. This is tape number four, side 
A
. 
A: Prior to leaving 
Austria
, my mother and I were in
 almost daily telephone 
contact. 
Q: Le Œ you were talking ab out maut Œ going to 
Mauthausen 
though.  
A: I™m sorry. The day before we left for the 
United States
, we decided my  Œ my  
fiancée and my friend and I decided to in
oculate ourselves ag
ainst any kind of 
homesickness, so visited mau Œ we visited 
Mauthausen
. 
Mauthausen
 is in a 
fantastic place, it™s on the top of a hill. Be
autiful view, and unspeakable horrors. In 
™56, 
Mauthausen
 was very different, I am sure, th
an what it is now. It was much 
closer to what it was in 1944, and we ha
d a vivid sense of what had Œ wh at mu st 
have been. And Œ and it certa
inly recalled all the horrors which we read about and 
which we heard about from th
e surviving friends and rela
tives who came back and 
who Œ so me of whom came back from 
Mauthausen
. I have a number of uncles who 
were in 
Mauthausen
 and who came back. And so  I could now put togeth er the Œ 
the name and the place, and it certainly cure
d me for Œ for many, many years, for 38 
years from Œ from any kind of homesickne
ss. And then the next morning, as I 
mentioned, we were bo
und to go to Œ to 
Salzburg
 and then back and fo rth until we

got to the plane. Prior to leaving, fi
nding ou Œ we only found 
out that we were 
coming to the 
United States
 about a week before we left. We did not know 
precisely what was going to  happen, how lo
ng things would take. And shortly after 
we left 
Hungary
, my mother and I, and my fian
cée™s parents were in daily 
telephone contact. The original plan was 
that her Œ her parents and my  mo ther 
would essentially come to 
Austria
 and then  we would meet
 there. The peasant who 
helped us over, indeed  went to Œ to 
Buda pest
 and he on Œ he also told them that 
they could come with him and 
he would help them. But they
 didn™t want to take the 
chance. It started to be fairly late in 
December. My mother and a cousin of mine 
went down to 
Szeged
, which is close to the Yugoslav
ian border. They tried it there, 
they couldn™t do it, they were turned b
ack. And I told my 
mother not to go 
anywhere, just stay in 
Budapest 
and see what happens and leave the country 
legally. I didn™t want to wait for her because
 by then we had the papers and I didn™t 
want to miss the opportunity  to come to the 
United States
. So, late at night on th e 
19
th
 of Decemb er we touched down. On  the 20
th
, I met my uncle, who was very 
strange, or somewhat strange, told me th
at you don™t need those Jews. You co me 
with me, I live in 
New Jersey
, and I™ll take care of you. I told him that, that™s nice, 
but I came with my fiancée and I™m not go
ing to let her just drift away. He 
reluctantly took her al
so with him, and us. We went to this 
New Jersey
 place, it™s

Wharton
, 
New Jersey
, it™s a small town, small Hungarian town , sort of. Most of 
the Hungarians who live there,
 lived there since either th
e 20s or 30s, or after the 
war, which meant that most of them were 
Nazis. Now my uncle is a fisi Œ was a 
physician. I didn™t know it then, but I found
 out very so on that he converted, and he 
wanted to keep his Jewish 
origins a deep, dark secret. 
This led to a fallout, and a 
very irreconcilable difference between him and me. Until I left 
Hungary
, I went to 
say Kaddish for my  father every day. Wh en  
I came to this countr
y, I couldn™t. There 
was no Jewish synagogue in 
Wharton
. My uncle arranged for me to have a job, 
mean Œ two Œ two weeks after 
I came, as well as my fian cée. She was a chemist, she 
spoke English, she got a fairly good job. 
I got a general helper™s job in a small 
factory, not a very satisfactory job for an
 engineer, but that was what I cou-could 
have. Wh at Œ and it went on for a couple of
 months, but what really broke things is 
that in March was my 
Yahrzeit
, and my  fiancée and I had decided to go to the next 
town, which had a little, small sy nagogue. A
nd we Œ to say Kaddish. So I went to 
say Kaddish, and there we met a friend of
 my uncle™s whom we Œ knew we were 
Jewish. And that friend told my uncl
e a couple days later that we saw 
George
 and 
his fiancée in a synagogue. You know, ho 
Œ what Œ what™s going on? Well, my 
uncle was quite furious about this and told 
me that Œ why didn™t I tell him this, he 

would have taken me a hundred miles so
mew h ere, where nobody knew him. So it 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
116
was a big fallout. I wrote to my  mo ther very
 angrily, and so  angry that I forgot to 
put the address. And it Œ the letter was 
intercepted by the mailman, who was a 
Hungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian 
priest of the town , who opened the letter 
and in short order found out who th e letter 
came from, and with 
e Œ much glee I am 
sure, gave it to my uncle, who almost kille
d me. And wrote a letter to my mother 

that I will end up in a gallo
ws in this country  and I w
ill Œ and I am just a terrible 
person. My mother, who was 
absolutely petrified as to
 what will happen to me. 
Anyway , make the long story short on that
, I was able to get a scholarship at 
Temple 
University to learn English, and in 
March of 1958, wh ich was Œ ™57 rather, 
sorry, three and a half months after I went 
to live with my uncle,
 I left. My fiancée 
stayed there. I went to vi Œ to 
Philadelph ia
, I stayed there fo
r over a year. My 
fiancée and I sort of broke up 
at this point. She moved to 
New York
, and later on 
she got married. My uncle and I broke up quite
 a bit, quite severely, and my mother 
left 
Budapest
 in August of 1957, with a visa to 
Israel
. She never went to 
Israel
, 
she stayed in 
Italy
. My uncle, wh o was her brother, helped  him Œ her a bit, 
however, in reality what he did is he told 
me that I have to he
lp my mother. And I 
sent my  uncle a certain amount of money 
every month so  that he would send it to 
my mother. After 
Temple
, I got a job as an engi Œ junior engineer at 
Westinghouse
, 
and I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at 
Drexel
 and 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
117
I started to study engineering. And I did 
that until March of ™58, at which time I 
found out that my
 mo ther was going to  come to the 
United States
 and sh e will be 
coming in th e next six months. And my  uncle 
very specifically to
ld me that he was 
not going to  help my  mo ther come to the 
United States
, or help her when she™s 
here. So I had no choice in the matter, I quit school. I went to 
New York
. I was 
unemployed there for a little wh
ile, and then my friends have it Œ my friend™s help, I 
got a job. And with another interesting st
ory, I met a Russian princess who helped 
me to get the job here in 
Wash ington
. This Russian princess 
happened to be the 
cousin of the 
Lazar
(ph). Her name was Princess 
Trumbetsko y
(ph), and for some 
reason and another, hil Œ she liked me. And she called Cardinal 
O™Boyle
, who was 
the chancellor of the Ca
tholic University of 
America
 and told him that, here is this 
refugee boy, and that she would like to help
 him. And I got a interview, and I got a 
job as an instructor there. I also enrolled in
 graduate school there, I stayed there for 
seven years. I taught there mechanical engine
ering, a-and endi Œ ending up as an as-
assistant professor and receiving my Master™s
 degree in mechanical engineering in 
1962. In 1960, I met a young, Jewish gi
rl, and we got married that summer. That 
marriage was a disaster and we divorced 
nine months later. Two months after I 
came to 
Washington 
in ™58, my mother arrived he
re. And I live with my mother 
from ™58 until ™64. And I work
ed in the univers
ity and my mother Œ most of the 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
118
time my mother didn™t work
, essentially. She found a 
little job to get a social 
security, finally. And the university was Œ 
the university experience was Œ was not 
as rewarding as I was hoping fo r, it Œ it™s 
a small school. At that time Catholic 
Univ ersity was a rather backwards school 
in terms of theology.
 They still didn™t 
step out to the 15
th
 century, and although th
ey tolerated me as 
a Jew, they didn™t 
tolerate me  as a divorced Jew, and I got so
me flack and by the time I realized that 
that™s not much of a future for me, I got
 another job, and I left. Well, actually, 
divorce wasn™t as bad as my remarriage in 
1964. I met another Jewish girl here, and 
we married. And that Œ after that, things 
became very intolera
ble. By then I only 
work ed part-time at school. I got a job in 
a research inst Œ a research in Œ firm, a 
small firm, and it was very 
interesting. One thing whic
h happened  after I got my 
citizenship in 1962, shortly 
after I got my  degree, is I got my  passport, and I took 
advantage of still working in 
a university and I went to 
Euro pe 
for two months, 
which was the first time since ™56, and the fi rst time I really had 
a chance to travel. 

And it was a fabulous two months of Œ of
 Œ of not just vacationing, but Œ but 
discovering western 
Europe
. It was very interesting, 
because I sailed on a ship, 
which was called the 
USS France
. On the manifesto of that ship, there was a girl, 
her name was 
Toby Yaspar
(ph). She became my wife a 
year later. We didn™t know 
that we were sailing on the same ship, or if
 we were traveling together. We met in a 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
119
Œ in a Jewish get together, about a half a 
year later. In 1966, I went to join th e Œ 
work for the navy. At that time I already fi
nished all the courses which I needed  for 
my  
PhD
, and I needed a thesis. A nd the univ
ersity had no laboratory wh ich was 
really capable of doing anyt
hing. So one of the lecturer
s there, who wo
rk ed  fo r th e 
David Taylor 
Model Basin, told me to
 come to work for him,
 and then I can work 
on my thesis there, which is what I did. I 
worked there 11 years.
 I worked there in 
high energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my  thesis. I never got my  degree, because by 
the time I wrote my thesis, I 
lost  my minors, which was 
nuclear engineering, and I 
just didn™t Œ I was in Œ in school studying
 12 years at that poi
nt, and I had enough of 
it. And I really didn™t think that
 I needed it. So I had all the 
PhD 
courses finished, 
and I Œ th e thesis finished, the comp rehens
ive was the only thing I didn™t. It was 11 
years of research; nice years, interesting 
research. I wrote more than 50 papers. I 
was involved in the professional developm
ent there. And then 
in 1977, I had an 
opportunity to get a promotion somewher
e else, which I did. I moved from 19 Œ 
from 
Maryland
 where I lived, to 
Virginia
. Unfortunately, my 
family life did not 
turn out as well as my career. After six y
ears, my wife and I, with mutual consent 
got divorced. Reason why we 
did Œ and this was a Œ again a fairly long story, is I 
had a problem having children, wanting ch ild
ren, and she wanted  children. We went 
through three years of therapy and the th erapy resolved noth
ing except that her

biological clock was running and that the only
 way that she could have a child is if 
she will marry somebody else. 
Q: Did you not want children because what 
of Œ you went through when  you were a 
child? 

A: Precisely. I didn™t think that I would 
be a very comp etent father after which I 
went thro ugh, and th e father which I Œ whom
 I had, wh om I adored in one sense and 
in another sense I was very ambivalent abou
t, and I was afraid that I would be just 
like him and I would be incomp etent and I di
dn™t want anybody to have that kind of 
a life. I went through three more years of 
therapy after this, because I wasn™t sure 
that Œ if it was the final decision, but it wa
s. Then  we divorced in ™73 - ™74. And it 
was during our separati
on when  I went to 
Israel
 the first time. It was a fantastic 
experience in 1970. It was a real revelation,
 and the first time in my life, perhaps, I 
felt home. And I didn™t feel home in a sense 
that I wanted to live there, but I felt a 
real close kinship. I had many friends
 there, and Œ and the land was just 
indescribable. I went back two more times 
in the next 15 years af
ter that. I traveled 
a great deal, I was single for 20 years. I 
traveled every year
 abroad, from the 
Far
 
East
 to the 
Middle East
 to 
Europe
 many times. My career went fine. I worked for 
the navy two mo re jobs. From 1977 to ™88, I work ed fo r a high en ergy laser project, 
where I became a project manager, and it 
was a very exciting, new edge, high Œ 

 
Interview with George Pick

121
high tech e Œ envelope program, edge of 
the envelope program. And the next one is 
Œ ha-happened from 1988 to
 1994, where I wo
rked for a multi-national project 
office, which was the 
NATO [indecipherable] 
office, where I very Œ where I 
jokingly said I wanted  this job because I 
Œ al-always in my  job I was the only one 
with an accent, and this Œ in this office
, I would be in the majority, having 13 
different nations, and people 
from 13 different nations wo
rk there, although I was 
the only Hungarian. And we had a lot of fu
n, it was a very interesting project, 
developing a Œ a vertical mi ssile. And I wa
s very instrumental in that. After the 
project was over, wh ich was in 1993, unfor
tunately things for the navy became a 
little bleak, and the technical challenges Œ 
whereas the money sort of went away. 
And at the end of 1994, I decided to Œ 
to retire. There were two things which 
happened in the early 
90s. One is that my mother got si
ck at age 89. We lived apart, 
but very close for 20 years. Now, we 
moved back together, she moved back. Sh e 
was an invalid and I took care of her for 
18 months. And the last 18 months of her 
life perhaps was the happiest for many years 
for her, in spite of her sickness. She 
felt that we were again together. In her 90
th
 birthday sh e beca Œ she got the heart 
failure. They pulled her out for some reason,
 she lived six more 
weeks. And then  in 
May of 1991, she died of heart failure, he
r fourth. In 1990, af
ter some  unsuccessful 
relationships, some long term, some shor
t term, I met a woma
n who was as far

away from my culture as a
nybody could be. Sh e wa Œ she™s Mexican, her name is 
Letitia
. And wh at I found out, actually it was 
in 1991, and I found  out that when 
my mother got sick, that my American girl
friend didn™t stick out with  me, but this 
woman, whom I met only two or three week
s earlier, did. And she stuck with me 
for a year and a half almo
st, with Œ under these cond
itions and Œ and I found not 
only a kinship, but also love. We got married
 in 1992, and we are still married. She 
works in the Mexican embassy and we are pr
etty happy now. So I think that™s the 
end of the story. 
Q: Well, there are just a few more things
 I want to ask you now about working at 
the mu seum as a volunteer. What was your 
first encounter with the mu seum before 
you went to work  there? How di
d you learn ab out the mu seum? 
A: I learned about the muse
um probably 10 years before
 it was built, through some 
solicitations and thro ugh friends whose Œ w
ho provid ed some funds to the mu seum. 
I did not know very much 
about the museum until I sa
w an ad, I think in the 
ﬁ
Washington Jewish Week
,ﬂ where the museum adver
tised for volunteers. This 
was in 1992. And I went to the 
L
 Street, where the museum headquarters were at 
the time, and I didn™t know wh at was going 
on, and I volunteered and I said I could 
help in the library, could do
 some translations from Hunga
rian to English. And I got 
Œ I Œ I worked a little b it with Œ with a car Œ with 
Sheri
(ph)
 Sheb o
(ph) Œ you know 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
123
Œ I don™t know if you know 
Sheri
(ph). She Œ I think sh e still 
works up in the library. 
And I wo rked there for a couple of months
 until the first course started for the 
volunteers for the visitors™ services. And I was in Œ in that group. 
Q: Why Œ why did you start working for the mu seum? 
A: I felt that the museum fulfills a miss
ion for me. I am a survivor and I had a 
responsib ility and a mission until I can, and I™m 
capable of, to associate myself with 
projects which have somethi
ng to do with the Holo caus
t. My awareness started  
before the mu seum, in the mid Œ mid-80s, 
when Holocaust becam
e a subject, which 
they spoke again about. As you know, th
e Holo caust was a taboo su bject, even in 
this country, for many years. Altho ugh I read a n Œ a number of books, it™s 
astonishing how little came up 
between say 1956 and 1986.
 There were a few books 
only, and not very much of the Holocaust.
 I think where I becam
e more aware is the 
gathering. I was a volunteer there, because I 
felt that I w as really not a survivor, that 
Œ that, you know, this was fo
r the older surv ivors, and th
e concept of child survivor 
did not hit me at that point. It hit me a c
ouple of years later, when I started to read 
about child survivor groups. And in  1991 
I got associated  with a group here in 
Washin gton
, called the 
Washington-Baltimo re
 area child survivors, and I became 
very active. We had a conference in 19
91, and at that time I knew about the 
museum, and I became very inte
rested in that, as well as 
the child survivor group. I 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
124
started to write, I started to read more, I 
started to speak to groups. And by 1992 - 
1993, I was a Œ a full-fledged volunteerwho is Œ was more than eager to do 
something, and I liked the id
ea of wanting to educate the 
public, as well as others, 
about the Holocaust. I 
felt that the people, even the 
Jewish people, were ignorant 
and that they really need education, a
nd I felt that the mu seum was a Œ was the 

vehicle for that. And so when
 we finished, I was more th
an eager to start working 
there. The first thing I did is I, when th
e opportunity arose, I Œ I completed the 
learning center specialist course, and I fini
shed another cor Œ specialized course for 
Œ for student, and then for teacher guides 
in the permanent exhibition, which I still 

can do, and do occasionally. A
nd then I got associated w
ith the speakers™ bureau in 
1980 Œ in  1995. And in ™95 - ™96, I Œ I 
spoke to a number of outside groups: among 
them Pentagon, a numb er of army  es
tablishments, schools, synagogues and 
churches. And I feel that Œ that that aspect
 of Œ of my  wo rk, in conjunction with the 
museum is very appropriate fo
r me as a Œ as a survivor. 
Q: Are the talks that you give to th ese groups different? 

A: Some of them are d ifferent. Most of 
them center about my 
own story, you know, 
survi Œ as a survivor. But I have sp
oken to high schoo
ls, such as the 
Lee 
High 
School in 
Silver Spring
 about other things, such as the relevance of Œ of the 
Holocaust in today™s world. It™s a Œ it™
s amazing how many people think that the 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
125
Holocaust is really not relevant, and how I f
eel that that™s wrong, and that there is 
tremendous relevance even today and will fo
r the future. In a sense, I am very 
desperate to Œ to Œ to pres
erve the memory, which what
ever means that takes. I 
wrote up my  story, which was published, 
incidentally, in 1993 also, as a Œ as a 
collection of stories with 11 other Hung
arians and Œ and it™s published in a book. 
And I Œ I am writing now a Œ a lo Œ lo
ng Œ longer autobiography which will be 
probably  a full-length book
. Not just my Holocaust,
 but my post-Holocaust 
experience in life in general.  
Q: How has working at the museum affe
cted your life? Has it affected your 

memories of the Holocaust? 
A: It certainly has. It in
duced me to Œ to learn a lot more. I thought I knew the 
Holocaust fairly well, through roughly 10 - 
15 years of reading, 
but I found out that 
I needed to learn a great deal too. And in
 the last five years, oh, I read maybe a 
couple of hundred bo
oks on the Holocaust and I took 
a numb er of courses, mo stly 
in the museum. There are tremendous cour
ses in the museum, for learning center 
specialists and research depa
rtme nt. I try to go to  every course and every lecture 
and ev ery one or two day cour Œ one or two day Œ 
Q: Seminars, conference? 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
126
A: Œ sem-seminars, w h erever it™s offered, then wherever I have time. I Œ I went 
maybe 50 of them already. So I am Œ I™m
 really immersed, and it made me very 
conscious about a lot of things
. A lot of things which a lo
t of people just sort of 
don™t care about or Œ or feel that it™s not 
Œ not relevant any mo re
, and I think it is.  
Q: Why do you thi
nk it™s relevant? 
A: Why is it relevant? I think that it™s re
levant because people are Œ mo st people in 

this country and everywhere else in the 
world are still as disinterested in what 
happens to other groups who 
are discriminated against, or
 who are being killed, as 
they were 53 years ago when
 the Jews were killed, and I think the message is still 
fresh. You cannot be disinterested , you mu
st be involv ed, because involvement is 
the only insu rance for th e wo rld to prevent mass genocides. 

Q: Do you think, as a staff member at
 the mu seum, you bring special insights 
because you are a survivor? 

A: I do believe that that™s the case. I belie
ve that every time that I say to a group 
who comes, and whose Œ and 
I give group Œ little Œ little 
group orientations when I 
say that my  name is 
George Pick
 and I am a survivor and all of a sudden everybody 
looks at me. And it Œ it Œ I think a survivor 
is a Œ is the only dire
ct link people have 
to the Holocaust, and I believe that that is
 a unique thing I bring to  the mu seum, and 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
127
all the survivors who are there, bring to  the mu seum. And I think the mu seum 
should take maximu m advantage of that. 

Q: With your survivor friends, have you ev
er tried to encourage them to volunteer 
at the mu seum, and if so wh at Œ 
wh at did th ey respond to you? 

A: Yes, I do, I Œ the Œ I have two sets of
 survivor friends. The Œ so me of them are 

older than  I am. The ones who are Hungarian
, and who are in their 70s, and some of 
who gave consid erable amount
 of money to  Œ to the mu seum. Who can afford to , 
but they  do. And who are Œ some who arenot as wealthy, my self included, who 

would give our time. I know that a numbe
r of us are volunteering in the mu seum 

who are Hungarians and who are survivors.
 Same thing from the survivor Œ child 
survivor group. And I am Œ 
Q: So th e Œ so the response to Œ wh en 
you ask people to volunteer has been good? 
A: Not as good as I would like it. I woul
d like to have more of them volunteer and 
more of them go out, but each year I can Œ I can persuade a few more people to Œ to 
get involved . And as Œ that™s always pleasi
ng to me, and I™m always
 gratified if that 
happens Œ if Œ when  that happens. And I™m
 trying to keep people™s minds out Œ 
interestingly enough, few Œ few of my fri
ends who really suffered a great deal 
through the camps, are not willing to speak 
out and not willing to
 face, maybe never 
will face th e horrors they Œ they had g
one through. And Œ and I sympathize and I 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
128
understand that. But I encourag
e everybody else, who are capable of talking, to Œ to 
talk to the museum, talk
 to the foundation, the 
Shoah
 Fo undation, and give 
testimony. 
Q: Can you describe your relationships 
with th e other volunteers at the mu seum, 
who are survivors or witn
esses to the Holocaust? 
A: We have a very close-knit relationship.
 We know, of course wh o the survivors 
are, and we speak perhaps mo re among ours
elves. We have now a group who meet 
about twice a Œ about once every two months
. We have now th e Œ the director of 
survivor affairs, and
 Martin Goldman
, who is encourag ing us to interact with him 
and with each other. We are very conc
erned about the museum and we are 
concerned about the direction the mu seum ta
kes. We want to make sure that the Œ 
the Jewish aspect of the Holocaust is emphasized and that the Jewish aspects of the 
Holo caust are not going to  fall by the 
wayside. We understand it™s a Œ it™s a 
government institution, but we still believe 
that the main event 
of the Holocaust was 
still the Œ the Holocaust against the Jewish
 people. And we em
phasize that among 
ourselves, and among the Œ the visitors. We do 
not think this is in contradiction with 
any kind of mu seum policy, should  not be
, and mu st not be. And so we are Œ we 
feel that we want to preserve the museum
™s main  mis si o n ,wh ic
h is to explain the 
Holocaust and show what Œ what 
had happened during that period. 

 
Interview with George Pick

129
Q: Do th e Œ you think th e emphasis is becomi ng less Jewish? 
A: I do. 

Q: In what way? 
A: Well, I think we have now, this year 
particularly, succeeded in steering the Œ the 
museum back a little b it. I was unhappy ab
out the Œ the Nazi Olympics. I think it 
was Œ it ma ke Œ it first of all, cost a lot 
of money and a lo t of resources, and I don™t 
think it has a direct relationship to the Holo
caust. I mean, it was a Œ an event, a Nazi 
event, but there were many, many, many ot
her events, which had direct relations. I 
am very happy now that the 
Kovno
 ghetto exhibit will come
. I was happy with the 
Fry 
exhibit. But the Œ but I tho
ught that going Œ going with 
that Nazi exhibit Œ Nazi 
Olympic exhibit was essentially going away
 from that. I was al
so unhappy for the 
same reason of that little exhibit we had, which was the faces of 
Bosnia
, or 
whatever they called. Which I sympathize again, I felt that it was a terrible 
genocide, and you know, I symp athize with a
ll this, but again, th
at served to Œ to 
steer away the muse Œ from the museum™s 
main mission. And I don™t think we can 
afford that, we have too many other Œ too 
Œ too many things wh ich is not in the 
main exhibit, which should be said
 in the various other exhibits. 
Q: Such as? 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
130
A: Well, such as Œ what, for example was 
the Œ you know, the Jews, as victims are 
shown pretty well in the main exhibit. Bu
t what about the Jews as contributors of 
European culture and science? We were not victims before 
Hitler 
came; we were 
great contributors. There is Œ I think th
e mu seum has that part Œ the mu seum™s 
mission is very integrated with that, to s
how that Œ that our contribution, our 1,000 
year old contribution to  European culture
 and civilization and technology is more 
than just six million deaths. And I think th
e museum should have an exhibit for that 
Œ pretty soon, as a matter of fact. That™s
 one idea, and I had 
about 20 or 30 other 
ideas which I wrote up as a Œ in a memo
 to the management, and which I submitted 
to the ma Œ high management in January  of 
this year. I really be
lieve that they are 
looking at some of it, and so me of these 
ideas are already bearing some fruition. But 
I think th ey have a long way to go, and ma
ny years to do it. And I think th at Œ that Œ 
that management should not forget
 these aspects of the Holocaust.

 B
. 
Describe your impressions of the museum
™s non-survivors volun
teer and staff, both 
Jewish and non-Jewish. 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
131
A: My impression of the non-su rvivor volunteers? 
Q: And staff. 

A: And staff. 
Q: Those who are Jewish, and non-Jewish. 
A: Okay, yes, of course. I think that it 
is not a coincidence that in the volunteer 
corps, probably 95 pe
rcent are Jewish, whether they ar
e survivors or non-survivors. 
I feel that, and I very mu
ch encourage anybody who vol
unteers to volunteer for the 
mu seum whether Jewish or non-Jewish. But 
there is, I think, a reason why Jews feel 
mo re of a mission there than a non-missi
on. And I feel the same thing ab out the 
staff. I am sorry to say that
 one of the concerns I have
, and not only I, but many 
others, is that many of the staff, th e Jewi
sh staff, is leaving 
the museum, and many 
of them already have left. 

Q: Why is that? 

A: Well, that™s a good question, I don™t Œ 
I don™t know wh at the answer is, but I 
have a feeling that the answer is very comple
x. One aspect of that answer is that the 

museum, in some respects be
come a bureau Œ bi Œ be Œ 
is becoming a bureaucracy , 
just like any other bureaucracy and it kills
 initiative. And there are some Œ there 
were some very bright people there, with
 ideas and initiatives, who were stifled  and 
who were frustrated and who fi
nd Œ found a dead end situa
tion th ere, and left. They  

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
132
were not just a bunch of young people who left, whom I knew and symp athized 
with, and who would have loved to stay 
in a museum if th
ey have seen for 
themselves some Œ some way up and some 
way to develop. Bu t some senior man Œ 
senior people, senior historians, whohad a reputation, and whose reputation 

enhanced th e reputation of the mu seum, su
ch as the research center. I was very 
sorry to see 
Baron
(ph) 
Vaughn
(ph) first of all leaving. I was very sorry to see 
when 
Sylvia Milton
 left. And my fear is 
that, with these kind 
of people leaving the 
museum, the research institute 
is not going to be able to 
attract the ty pe of reputable 
scientists, such as 
Browning 
and others. It is not just a matter of mo ney, I think it™s 
a matter of reputation, and 
I think the Œ the institute st
arted out as a world class Œ 
world class institution, and I am
 not positive that it still ma
intains that status today, 
and I think it should. And if it doesn™t now, 
it should certainly stri
ve to do it again. 
That is an awful lot that in
stitution needs to do, and had 
the potential to doing it. I 
think the mu seum management should defi
nitely strive to Œ to nurture that 
institution, and my impression is
 that it is not doing that. 
Q: What would you like to see them do? 

A: What I like to see them do is to firs
t of all encourage a
nd hire world class 
historians to work there. As I said , some
 of them already left, and I™m not positive 
that too many of them wants Œ wants to wo
rk there under the ci
rcumstances. I think 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
133
some enticement, grants, sut Œ etcetera, pr
obably will bring so me 
of them back. But 
I think that there is a Œ a limitation th
ere. There are other institutions who are 
comp eting for these same people, and I thi
nk if Œ if the research institute is not 
going to  comp ete successfully in the next 
few years, they may lose that kind of 
brainpower, and I think that would be a great loss. 

Q: You had mentioned that 
you had many other ideas fo
r other exhibits. Can you 
just name a few? 
A: Yes, well I Œ I believe that some of th
e exhibits, some of various ghetto exhibits 
Œ I think 
Ko vno
 is Œ is a good Œ good Œ I™m sure 
it will be a good exhibit, but there 
are other ghettos and life in Œ in gh
ettos which were very different from 
Kovno
 and 
which is portrayed in the main exhibits, 
which should be shown. For example, in Œ 
in west 
Europe
, the ghettos were very different. I th
ink that there shou
ld be exhibits 
about the Hungarian Jews, and this is 
not because I am a Hungarian Jew, but 
because the Hungarian Jewish story is ve
ry different from the story of the Polish 
Jews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it Œ in 
my estimation it™s underrepresented in the Œ 
in the main exhibit, anyw
ay. So it should 
Œ it should find someplace else. The 
French Jews same thing, and Œ and the west
 European Jews, in a general sense, are 
also underrepresented, and they  should
 be given at least temporary space. 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
134
Q: Are there any powerful experiences, or
 me mo rable experiences you™ve had while 
you™ve been  wo rking at the mu seum? 
A: Yes. These me mo rable experiences had been very asso Œ very  mu ch associated 
with teachers training there. I 
was fortunate to be invited 
a couple of times to speak 
to them, in a 
Belfer
 conference. I was very sorry to see 
Marshall
 
Sa bo l
(ph) leave, 
who recognized very early on th e poten tial of
 the survivor contributions to teachers™ 
education. After 
Marshall 
left, he took some time in doing, and I mu st say to my se 

Œ to Œ must say that I was 
the one who forced the issue 
also there, until the a Œ the 
education department recognized the co
ntribution with  the educ Œ wh ich the 
survivors could make to education. But I 
had some me morable instances this year, 
when I participated in a 
Belfer
 conference, not as a speaker, but as just sitting 
around and listening to others
, and having teachers come 
to me with questions and 
wanting me to show them the main ex
hibit and comment on th em. And one Œ and 
telling me Œ and I have go-gotten letters from 
them, several, not just this year, but 
other years, is that their me Œ most mean
ingful experience was to meet survivors. 
That many things they could learn from bo
oks and from exhibits, but the person to 
person touch was Œ was mo st meaningful fo
r them, and which they
 hope to transmit 
to their students. And I really believe th
at. That was certainly most memorable for 
me there. 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
135
Q: Are there any particular parts of the mu seum with which you id entify with? 
Anything special there? 

A: Of course, I Œ I under Œ I identify with 
ev erything. It would be saying, you know, 
if you have many children, who do you lo
ve more? But despite of that, there are 
certain things obviously , wh ich Œ which were
 closer Œ or which are closer to me 
than other pieces are. For 
example, the portrait of 
Raoul Wallenberg
. Obviously, 
the man who saved my life, directly and 
indirectly and who saved my  immediate 
family™s life, makes a difference to me. Bu
t Œ but everything is meaningful. And of 
course th-the-the large pictures which 
Œ which show the Hungarian  Jews on th e 
ramp of 
Auschwitz
 in the selection process, the 
two little boys whose bewildered 
faces remind me of my own, and whose unif
orm they wear, I had as six years old. I 
have a picture of it, and I provid ed that 
to the museum to show that this was a 
uniform which little H u ngarian boys, whethe
r they were Jewish or not, wore. And 
so I am alw ays very moved by their faces, 
and think of me, that
 I could be one of 
them. They of course, not surv ived  and I did.
 And that is a very emotional thing, but 
for me Œ and a lot of people always wonde
r, how could I be a su
rvivor and Œ and go 
through that Œ that exhibit so many times
, isn™t that stressful? The answer is, 
absolutely. It™s a gut-wrenching
 experience, and I Œ I feel th at I owe that to Œ to the 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
136
dead, and I owe that to myself
 and I owe that to the people whom I try to educate, 
of wh at it was, not just to look from the outsi
de in, but what it was to be in, in hell.  
Q: Be-Because of the very difficult expe
riences you had during th e war, was there 
ever a time when you resisted re
membering what you experienced? 
A: I Œ I do not remember consciously resist
ing. After the war, particularly after the 
communists took over in 
Hungary
, this was a taboo su bject. We did not focu s at 
this, we had day Œ daily problems and con
cerns. The memory, as fresh as it is 53 
years later, was somehow buried for many,
 many decades, without losing its 
vividity
, its Œ its vividness, its Œ its Œ its re
levance. And it stayed there. I mean, it 
obviously th is kind of things don™t 
go away forever, but I never resisted it 
consciously, I si Œ I simply just went so
mewhere else. I Œ I did Œ and I Œ I mu st say 
also that my life is not defined by the Holo
caust. Maybe in the later, last few years 
it™s focusing Œ the Holocaust is more of a focu s. But as you heard it from my  post-
Holo caust experiences and my  Œ my  profe
ssional life, I was not Œ the fofo Œ the 
Holo caust did not deter me in what I 
was doing. I was among th e probably few who 
ended up not in a helping profession. 
You would be a-ama
zed how many of the 
survivors ended up in a helping profe
ssion, or ha Œ how many ended up in 
becoming a Œ mo re lawyers and docto rs, 
and how few are engineers. But I was 
among th e ones who became the hard scientis
t and I felt that my real calling and 

 
Interview with George Pick  
 
November 13, 1997 
 

 
 
137
profession was engineering and 
science, although I am trying to catch up now, and I 
am very much like Œ I would like to learn 
as much as I can ab
out the Holocaust. I 
still do not regard myself as, you know, as a 
survivor only. But I f Œ want to use my 
survivor status to speak, and my  Œ my  priv
ileged voice to speak and to teach as long 
as I can. 
Q: Do you think you™d be a 
different person today if you hadn't gone through the 
wartime experience that you did? 
A: I am sure I would be. I think the wa
rtime experiences has Œ had taught me a 
great deal. Many things which I probably 
wouldn™t be. Persistence. Not be cowed 
by Œ by intimidations. Sometimes recognize 
when a crucial decisio n  have to be 
made, and I learned that heroes are not born , but made. Not un Œ I™m not com Œ 
saying th at I™m a hero, but at least I have 
seen heroes who became heroes, who were 
plain folk , and Œ and I brushed with  de
ath very  many times. So many times that 
sometimes I worry that I r
un out of luck
 eventually. 
Q: Do you feel Hungarian 
or American or Jewish? 

A: I have to  tell you the Œ I have to 
tell you a little story about this. You know 
Einstein
 was asked the same  question. The Œ does he feel American, German or 
Jewish, and he says Œ do you know what hi
s answer was? His answer was, well, as

Americans will say I Œ I am American, and 
of course the Jews will say I™m Jewish. 
But if my theory turns out 
to be incorrect, the Americ
ans will say I™m German and 
the Germans will say I™m Jewish . So the same way with me
, it™s Œ I feel that the 
components are there. I am 
a part Œ I have 22 years of 
me with Hungarian. I have 40 
years of me  with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and th ey 
somehow counteract and in teract. I Œ I think 
it is Œ is sort of a very simp-simplified 
question wh en one asks, who, what is, in 
what component. I Œ I mu st say, I love 
Hungarian literature, and I like Hungarian ar
t and music. I love American literature, 
but I love a lot of Œ lot of other thi
ngs. And my hobbies, for example are more 
universalist than either Hungarian, Americ
an or Jewish. But I 
lo Œ but there are 
components of all three, which I love, and 
then there are things 
which are associated 
with neither. For example, I Œ I love p
hotography, wh ich is neither Jewish Œ 

although there were many Jewish photog
raphers. Neither Jewish nor Hungarian 
were Œ there were a lot of good Hung
arian photographers. Nor American, where 
again, same  Œ same thing happen s. My 
interest and philosophy of life, I hope 

transcends somehow, this
 compartmentalization. 
Q: Is there anything you™d like to add th
at you haven™t said, before we finish? 
A: Yeah, I l Œ I like to go back
 to  the mu seum, and I like to go back  to a Œ a concern 
I Œ I had and raised and shall raise in 
the future, and th at is about teachers™

education. I believe that the vast majority
 of the teachers and ce
rtainly the students, 
who will be teaching Holocaust studies an
d who will be learni
ng Holocaust studies 
would be Ch ristian. I had 
had very uneasy few hours, few days in the mu seum 
about anti-Semitism. And this
 is specifically  in the 
Belfer
 conference this year, 
where I was Œ where I am Œ was looking at
 the struggle of non-Jewish teachers, 
trying to  teach non-Jewish teachers about 
the central Œ centrality of anti-Semitism 
and church anti-Semitism in the Holo caust. And the difficulties which these 
teachers had with the acceptance of this id
ea. And I was very 
concerned because I 
feel that if these teachers would simply 
ignore this, you know, wa Œ one of the Œ one 
of the teachers said well, what happens if
 e Œ we teach it different? And he says, 
well, you have a mo ral obligation to teach 
it this way. Well, that™s n ice. I always 
believe in moral obligations, 
but I heard of very spec Œ spe-specific and fairly 
practical objections. For example one bl
ack teacher got up Œ very few black 
teachers participated in th
is, said hey, I came from 
Tennessee
 from the Bible Belt. I 
cannot teach the Baptists that
 their belt Œ their Œ their New Testament is wrong. I 
can™t teach that, you know, I mean if the 
Jews are right, then they are wrong. How 
do I do th is? And I was really concerned an
d I am Œ I think that this is a great 
central concern and should be of the ed
ucation departme nt to Œ to  teach the 
Holocaust and the centrality of the a Œ of Œ 
of the anti-Semitism 
in such a way that

the teachers can accept it. I™m not talking suga
rcoating. I am talking truth, or I am 
talking ab out acceptable ways, so they
 can teach it. If you teach it without 
acceptable ways, then it won™t be taught. And 
if it is not taught, then the great point 
of the Holocaust, the great cause of the Ho
locaust is going to be lost. It™s not 
enough to teach what happen
ed, they must teach why it 
happened. And 
they cannot 
shirk from the fact that it largely happened 
because of the centuries of art Œ of anti-
Semitism. But how do you packag
e it, how do you do this so that the teachers can 
teach it and can accept it themselv es? I talked 
to teachers afterwards, they really are 
struggling. I mean, they Œ they  hear their 
own priests, they have their own beliefs, 
and then  they hear this, and they  don™t know
 how to resolve it. I 
think this needs to 
be really considered and reconsid ered in
 the mu seum, and th at™s not a small amount 
of work either. That™s my
 parting shot for this.  
Q: Well, thank you very mu
ch fo r doing th e interview. 
A: Thank you for Œ for letting me do it. I-I re
ally hope that I have pointed out some 
Œ some thoughts here. 
Q: You certainly have. This concludes the
