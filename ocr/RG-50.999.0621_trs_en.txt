Fritz Gluckstein was born in Berlin, Germ any, on January
 
24, 
1927. T his photo is f rom  1932.
 
H e  wa
s the son of a Jewish judge and Christianm other, Georg and 
Hedwi g Gluckstein. Here we see Fritz with his parents at the beach.
 
T hese contemporary photographs show places where Fritz li ved, 

attended school,and played.
 
As a child, Fritz enjoyed fam ily activities, f riends, and school 
gatherings. Here Fritz i s circled in them iddle.
 
Af ter the Nazis came to power, Fritz's f ather lost his job as a judge 
and because of  his f ather's and m other's backgrounds, Fritz was 
considered a geltungsjude, a counted Jew.And we wi ll hear m ore 
about that in a little bit.
 
T he Nurem burg racial laws based Jewishness on genealogy and 
religious practice.T hisis the star that Fritz, as a geltungsjude, was 
required to wear.
 
T hroughout thesediff icult times, Elf riede Dressler, Fritz's
 
aunt, 
provided the Glucksteins with m uch neededextra f oodas their rations 

continuedtodecrease. In this photo we see Fritz and his Aunt Elf riede 

af ter the war.
 
At the endof  the war,Fritz's parents stayed in Germ any and his 

father, Georg, resumed his Here we see Fritz with his m other and 

father af ter the war.
 

Fritz decided to imm igrate onhis own to the UnitedStates andarrive d 
in the U.S. in 1948 where he studied veterinary m edicine.
 
         
Fritz lives in the W ashington, D.C. area with his wif e, M
aran.  
Following his arri val in the UnitedStates afterthe war, heeventually 

becam ea doctorof  veterinary m edicine.
 
Af ter a stint in the U.S. Army, Fritz began a long anddistinguished 

career with thefederal governm ent includingat the U.S. Department 

of  Agriculture andending with the National Library of  Medicine. He

He hasa daughter, Ruth, andtwo granddaughters: Em ily who is 18

>> B ill B e n s o n
:  Fritz, thank you som uchf orbeing will ing to beour 
First Person today. You have so much to share with us in a short 

period.W e'll start right away if  that'sok.
 
>> F rit z G lu c k s t e in :   A ll righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were a young boy when Hitler cam e to
 
power in 
Germ any. Let's start with I telling us about yourf am ily and you during 

those years, living under the Nazis as their power gre w and as partof  
that, tell us what it meant to be geltungsjude,or counted asa Jew. 
W hat did thatm eanfor you and you
r f a m ily.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  A geltungsjude hadoneJewish and one 
non
-
Jewish parent and was raised Jewish. He was subject to all the 
regulations andhad to wear the star.The Nazis couldn't makeup their 
m ind.T hef arther away he livedf rom  Berlin, the
 
more likely he was to 
escape deportation because there he was subject to the whim s of the 

local com mander.
 
Bef ore Hitler, we hada ver y nice lif e. My f ather was a judge. He 
taught m e how to salute the f lag.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He won the Iron Cross in theFi
rs t  W o rld  W ar?
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Iron Cross inthe FirstW orldW arbecausedidn't 
serve in Germ any. Butwe had a very good life.W ent tothe zoo. 
W atched the big gorilla who when he gotanapple, caref ully looked. 

And in one blem ish, he would eat it.
 
M
y m other was Lutheran.W e celebrated both Jewish and 
Christian holidays. I got the best of two worlds , Hanukkahand 

Christm as and Passover and Easter.
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  But cam ethe day Hitler cam e topower, m yf ather 

wa s d ism isse d .  T he
 
day he was dism issed,he told not to Lefcourt 

through the f ront 
--
 
notto leave the court through thef rontdoor 
because there was adem onstration. My father said, I" I I cam e in 
through thef rontdoorandI will be leaving through thef ront door".
 
Of co u
rse, losthis job,m oney was quite a problem .W e had to 
m ove imm ediately. My AuntElf riede helped us ver y m uch, stood by 

us. Andm y m other's relatives also stoodby us. However, m y f ather's 
colleagues,at leastm ost of  them , said, so sorry, we can't have a
n y 
contact with you.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And these hadbeen colleagues on the court.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Other judges.So sorry. Oneor two m aybe,but 

m ostof them  sim ply couldn'tor didn't want to,I would say.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fritz, you were there, of course, during the1936 

Berlin Olym pics.T ell us a littlebit about that.W hat did it mean to you? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  35, 36, signs showed up in restaurants Jews are 
not welcome, and in the suburbs, goback toParis signs. There were 
special benches, the
 
36 Olym pics signs disappeared. T hem om ent 
af ter Olym pics,they cam e upagain.T hey didn't want to see, people 
f rom other countries, what was going on.
 
>> Bill Benson:  On abit of a lighter note, ashard as those things 
were, you were still a boy and you hadam ischievous spirit. You were 
telling m eaboutpranks would play on tourists.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  A friend ofm ine, sitting on abus,double
-de cke r,  
we were sitting there.There was a tour. Yousee here, that is the 
President's hom e. And over there 
[Indiscernible].
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time, Fritz, did yourf ather makeefforts to 
try to em igratef rom  Germ any to get out of Germ any?
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes, of course. But,of  course, in orderto 
em igrate, f irst you had the quota, then you hav
e to have money, and 
then you were able toget passage. It wasn'tso easy.
 

>> Bill Benson:  And so just all the doors wer e closed.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Couldn't justpack your suitcaseand leave, no. 
T he quota was called.You only got a visa if  you hadpa
ssa ge . I t  wa s 
quite diff icult.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So yourfam ily he's aliving u nder these 
circum stances,as you said, conditions are very hard, food is scarce, 
your f ather's lost his job. T hen comes Kristallnacht or Night of Broken 

Glass, Novem ber
 
9 through 
10, 1938. You'rejust 11 years old.T ellus 
about Kristallnacht.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, I went to school asusual.There was a 

broken shop window. Could have happened. Thenanother one.T he 
third one I realized som ething was going on. Andthen Ipasse
d by the 
synagogue and therewere flam es and smoke cam eout.
 
By the way, how did they know what windows  to break?They 
didn'thave lists, no. About a couple of months before, the Jewish 

shopkeeper had to place his name with white letters on the shop 

windo w
. All they had to do, look for the big white letters and could 
break it.
 
I remember I wentto school.Som eof our teachers were sentto 
the concentration camp. Got anoticef orhome: Because of special 
circum stances, reports wil l be late.
 
--
 
report cards w
ill b e  la t e .
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell our audience was Kristallnacht was.T hat was 
som ething that wasn't just in your comm unity.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  No. It was all over.W hat had happened, inParis, 

a m isguided young man shot and killeda council, Germanm e
m be r  of  
theembassy. And, of course, in interrogation,there was an outbreak 
of  violence.Actually, the people
 
--
 
it was done by well or ganized 
groups.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And it was all over Germ any?
 

>> Frit z Gluckstein:  All over Germ any. Inf act, Berlin an
d  sm a ll c it ie s 
were even worse. Berli n, of course, wasn't quite asbad aspeople 
thought of . But little town, it was horrible.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And on that nighthundreds of  synagoguesbefore 
burned throughout Germ any.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Andm any were sent to the concentration camp. 

My f atherfortunately escaped.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you realize at the tim ethat it was across the 
country? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Ihad a pretty good idea.W ehad apretty good 
idea.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said to me
 
--
 
th at w
as Novem ber
 
1938. You said 
thatthe startof  the war in Septem ber
 
1939, whenGermany invaded 
Poland, that's whenthings really changedf orJews andf or yourf am ily 
in particular.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: Well, of  course. First I had totake
 
--
 
Jews had to 
ta k

Start of the war. It we had todeliver jewelr y, radios, bicyclesf irst. And 
rations,m eat, white bread had special allotments.W e were allowed 

only to shop between4:00
 
and 5:00
 
in  t he  af
ternoon. Anda haircut, 
s o m e of t h e r e s t r i c ti o ns .
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou shoppedbetween4:00
 
and 5:00, the odds 
were good there was nothing lef t in the store.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes. My m other could go if  nobody was around. 

T he shopkeeper was decent, wait a m inute, I'll gi ve you som ething. 

B u t.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Am ong all of those restriction that tookplace, andyou 
m entioneda coupleof them , besides radiosand things like that, Jews 

were f orbiddenf rom  having pets.
 

>> Frit z Glu ckste in :  Ye s.T h at's
 
r i gh t .
 
>> Bill Benson: T alk about, if  you don'tm indsharing, about your pet.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W e took careof a pet offriends who were 
deported.T hey had trained him .If  you gave him  apieceof food and 

said " From  the Jew"  he ate it.But if you sa
id " From  the Nazis"  he did 
not.
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid f irst start having towear the star?
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  At that time, 41.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And one of the things you shared with m e is that 
police would com eby with pencils.
 
>> F
rit z Gluckstein:  Oh, yes. T here was a nasty policem an cam e with 
a pencil. And if  you get a pencil behind, pretty bad.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid deportations begin? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  In 1941. It started slowly andthenm oreand more 

af t e r .
 
>> B ill B e n
son:  Including m any of your classm ates andf riends.
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst e in :   Ye s.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou hada neighbor ora classmate or a 

colleague who was deported, did you have any idea where they we re 
being sent? 
 
>> F rit z G lu c k s t e in :   No . W ell, f irs
t, they said, well, m aybe
 
--
 
s o m e 
idea. Never really knew. At thebeginning, actually, notice you would 

be deported. And thenthey got the list.T heyhadto list their 
belongings andf urniture. And ina certain tim e came an off icer, 

actually a policem an, and hadto seal the arm
 
--
 
apartment, and hadto 
go to the closest,nearest, correctionsplaceandf rom there we wer e 

transported.
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time, where were you living?W ere you 

still in your own hom e? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  A sm all apar
tm e n t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Intoa sm all apartm ent.
 
T he allies started bombing Berlin about that tim e, too.W hat 
was that likefor you? You're facing the Nazis
 
--
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Hoped we wouldn't be hit. Atthat time I was still 

going to school. If  class beyond1:00, school startedtwo hours late.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the m orning?
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yeah. And we were sitting hoping it would stop 

soon. Onthe other hand,m aybe a little bit longer and school will be 

shorter.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Sounds like a typical kid.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  At that time, yes. And school closed1942.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And being a kid,besides hoping that thebom bing 
would delay school, you alsohad ahobby of collecting shrapnel.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes. Collected shrapnel
 
and exchanged for 
bigger shrapnel. Boys. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  As you began to tell us, youwere able to continue 
school until June
 
1942andthen the schools closed. Af ter that you had 
several ver y close calls yourself  with deportation.T ellus about those 
an
dthe events thatf ollowed. And alsotell usabout the closing of 
school for you.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Closing schoolsand they gave m e af inal report 
card.T he reason,becauseof  theordered closing of the Jewish 
sch o o ls.  I  gu e ss m o st of  m y cla ssm a te s we
re deported. Afew, one, 
two, cam eback. One or two went in hiding. And if  you were a 
geltungsjude, you survived butabout 35,40,all perished, and so did 
the teachers, m ost of  them.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wasstruck, in your book you write so eloquently 

abou
t your teachersand your fellow studentsas everyday heroes.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yeah. Particularly theteachers.They came, 
taughtus, helped usto forget them isery of everyday. T hey gave us 
som ething we couldbuild on later on.T hey cam e.W eknew they
 
wer e 
deportedbut truetotheir prof ession they cam e. They didn't realize
 
--
 
we didn't realize it, we didn'tappreciate it. Now I know what they did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I was really struck by what you wrote about that.
 
You had a very f rightening experience 
when your m other 
helped som eone who was f acing deportation.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes. My m other helpedsom eone carry suitcases 

to the collectionpoint. An an SS man whatare you doing?Tomorrow, 
if  your son andhusband report downtown to the correction ce
nter. 
Downtown was the special collection center.T here we were, about the 
tim e there were 10m en in a room  andthey also had non
-Je wish  
wi ves. Perm itted to liedown because theKom mandant
 
--
 
a  na sty S S . 
He hadf orbidden to lie down but did it anywa y. Ho wever, the 
policemen who guarded the building, whenever he left,theother cam e 
running out, "Get up, get up. He's com ing."  Rem arkable.W ebeen 
caught, we would have wound up at the Russianf ront.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Is thiswhen you encountered [Indiscernible]
? 
>> Frit z Glu ckste in :  Ye s, ye s. Na sty. Camefrom Vien na .W ell, afte r 

two or three days, the Komm andant's office for interrogation.W ell, m y 

father and an old gentlem an preparedm e,don't show any sign of  
contem pt orhostility, answer the questionf ully but donot, do not 
volunteer anything.
 
W ell, I went in the office. He was sitting therebehind hisdesk. 
At the side about 10 uniformed SS. He tried to catch me really
 
--
 
yo u r  
m other is Jewish? No,I said,m y m other is [Inaudible].
 
I had questions working at the Jewish comm unity. I tell you, 

gi ve you a decent job. T om orrow report to the labor exchange.
 
Outside Ifoundm y f ather. He stepped out. A sigh of  relief .To 
date, January
 
24,1943, m y 16th birthday, that was thef irst.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas thef irst.T ell us about the next one.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: The second one.W e were at thefactory. One 
m orning a goodf riendof m ine was sitting atthe bench doing some 
work f or the Air Force. Suddenly thedoor opens and the SS officer 

com es in. Get yourselfoutside! Outside we assem bled.Asked the 
driver to com e in.The truck came. Puton thetruck. And then back to 
the SS, we were drive n downtown.T here we were in what hadbeen a 

dance hall.All the tables and chairs had been removed and we 
cam ped in them iddle.For some of the wom en
 
--
 
it was Saturday, half 
day, plenty of the children were in childcare,m aybe at home. It was 
ver y badf or them .
 
W e were sitting there. It was am azing. No com plaints.W e were 
sitting there.Af ter hours, calledby a very nice  plain
-
clothed m an, get 
outof  here,don't wantto see you here again.W estepped out, about 
8:00
 
atnight. Andby stepping out at 8:00
 
atnight, we broke the law 
because curfew f or Jews was 8:00, through the winter 10:00
 
a t n igh t. 
W e walked hom e. 
 
My m other was
 
ona trip visiting her aunt. Sent a telegram , it 
would be advisable if  you cam e hom ef ast.T he next morning, justtim e 
to get ration andI went to the ration card office and loand behold 
there was abig m oving van. Ever yone cam eon them oving van. And 
we
 
were transported to collectionf or the synagogue where I had m y 
bar m itzvah three years ago.
 
T henagain we were transporteddowntown to abuilding of the 
Jewish congregation, so
-
called Rosenstrasse. And there we were, 
quartered inthe room  just enoughto 
lie down.W e spent our tim e 

deliberating what happened to us.
 
Standing in line
 
--
 
of course, f acilities weren't set f or hundreds 
of m ento come in. Af ter a week or so,ed into, I rem em ber, we got 
once at 4:00
 
turnips to eat, I rem em ber.
 
Af ter a week or so, was calledout. My release slip was typed 
by a secretary of  the Jewish congregation. Andm y f ather, too. Andwe 

both were ready to leave.W e hadtopresentour release slip to the 

sergeant,Sargeant Schneider. He looked atm y f atherand said, I 
judge you have been but you've certainly ruled the lives of  many 
people. My father said, I hopenot. And we lef t.
 
But, what we didnot know, while we were inside, there was a 
demonstration wherethe mothers and wives demonstrated, 

demanded the releaseof  the children
 
and husbands. Fight f irst the 
regular police, then the SS andGestapo. It was the only challenge to 
authority to Third Reich.
 
Said,no, let's not have it now.W ecan take care of the m ixed 
m arriages, geltungsjude let on,not know. Right after the Battle o
f 
Stalingrad.
 
So after thatI was sent to labor cam p.W e went side
-
to
-
side 
cleaning up af ter air raids.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we m ove on to that, just so we all hear that, it 
was the only dem onstrationto theThird Reich.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: The only demonstrationagainst authority. They 
didn't go.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And there's even been am ovie m adeaboutthis.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes, am oviem ade. And now there isof  the 

people who stoodupfor their loved ones, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So now both you
 
and yourf ather aref orced to be part 
of  these work details.So you startedto tell us, what were you f orced 

to do?
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, we had to clean upthe ruins.W em oved 
around and cleaned up streets. Actually therewas an accident,partof  
a  
wall f ell onm e, knocked m e outand I was injured.There was a 
m edic. He f ixed m e up temporarily. T hey brought m e to a hospital but 
were not perm itted,non
-
Jewish hospital were not perm itted to help 
Jews but they did it anyway. Sewed m eup.They tooka ri
sk o n  m y 
behalf .T hey could have gotten in real troublebut they took a risk. I'll 

never forget that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wasstruck
 
--
 
you shared wi thm e that as you were 
out theredoing thesework details where you're forcedto cleanup 

rubble, really hard work outthere
 
--
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes. Actually, of  course, there werefour other 
young, form er classm ates. Andtheolderm en, lawyers, chem ists, 
engineers. Of course, young people don't learn anything.T hey 
thought it a kind of school.
 
In m y case,
 
I rem ember a wheel barrel, whenwas being f illed, I 
was gi ven a question to which I had to answer when I cam eback.And 

still rem em berone.W hen you come back with an em pty wheel barrel, 

it rem ainedthe Great Lakes of the United States. Something else 
im a
gined50, 60 years. Of  course,f irst theolder m en hadtoexplain to 
us som eof  the language to be used.Became very helpf ul later on 
when I worked in afactory. Som enicepeople, really vital, teachedme 
four
-
letter words. Itried very m uch. Itdidn't work becausethose words 
cam e [Indiscernible] very sim ilar in Germ an and they did not work.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atone point during theseforced labor work details 

you were told that you were going to now have todo
 
--
 
you had a 
catastrophic m ission.
 
>> F r i t z G l
uckstein:  Yes.W e were bom bedout twice.T em porarily in 

the Jewish hospital.In them orning I setoutf or m y regular job, 
steppedout of the building, suddenly some SS cam e.Goon thetruck 
there. You're detached to so
-
called catastrophe m ission.
 
W ell ,  af
ter riding the truck, open it up, andthere we were in 
f ront of the devil's den. Eichmann's headquarter. Eichm ann was the 

drivin g f orcebehindthe deporedeportation.You knew who Eichm ann 
wa s .
 
W ell, very luck y, worked there. One young lieutenant, I was 
as
signed to him . I waslucky, he was ver y decent,not anti
-
S e m it ic , 
really. Som eof  theotherf ellows hada very r ough supervisor, nasty 

tim e. Deputy comm ander running around with adog and cursing, tried 
to sneakup.I was lucky, again. Might m ovefurniture
.  H e  wa s  ve r y 
c ivi l.
 
W ell, one day
 
--
 
I guess we m ovedfrom  rubbish. Said 
Ikeman
 
--
 
Eichm ann iscom ing. Oh, boy. I wondered, really wondered, 
how we would look like. Ordinary. Nobody noticed in the crowd. Came 

right next to me, gavesom e instruction,and l
ef t  a ga i n.
 
>> Bill Benson: T his absolute monster.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  I stood shoulderand shoulder with that monster 

but lucky.
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time,m iddle to the end of the war, you're 

in Berlin. As you described it tom e, Berlin was bom bed all thetim e, 

f requently. Food was scarce. Conditions were m ore andm orediff icult. 
How did you and yourparents manageto survi ve and exist under 
those conditions?W hat was it like for you then? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, you adapt. Didn't lose hope
. It wa s 
am azing. Food was scarce. A loaf of bread, them ice had gotten into 
it.W ell, cutoff  what was important and continuedeating.And, of 

course,didn't change clothes very of ten. Nohot water, no soap. You 

just adapted. And, of course,for spirit, always  told little story and jokes 
that helped us. 
 
[Inaudible] young man pulledhim out. Friend,you saved m y 
lif e.W hat canI dof or you? I want a statef uneral. Statefuneral. Yes. 

Andfatherf inds out I pulled you out of the river, he's going to kill m e
. 
SS man said,I am  going to shoot you. Unless you tell me which one 

of m y eye is glass. Oh, he said. Very easy. It's the right one. How do 

you know? Oh, it looks so human.
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: Then, of  course[Inaudible].T he bread was 

ho
rrible. Sometimes I don't know what they put in there. Everything 
substitute. My father, when wi ll this war be over?W ell, when the 
British eat rats andGerm an eat rats substitute.
 
T ho s e  lit t le s t o rie s . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As the Germandefenseof Berlin was
 
collapsing, you 
said to me that youand your f riendsf igured it would take31m inutes 

for the Russian tanks to get through the barriers that had been putup.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yeah.Whathappened one day, fall 1941
 
--
 
44 ,  
we were detached to build f ou
ndations fora new Berlin after the war. 

At that tim e. But detached again to build tanks, perhaps there.
 
--
 
trap s. 
T here we were digging ditches, 40
-
degree angles. So at night, I 
guess, m iddleof  thenight they gave us some soup. Next m orning they 

told us,
 
ok, you can go.
 
W ell, we looked at our handy work and thought, now how long 
wi ll it take the Russians to get through? 31 m inutes.T he Russian 

tanks will com e,tank traps, will laugh for 30 minutesand take one 
m inute to get through. 
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
>> F r
it z Gluckstein: That's actually what happened.T wo arm ies 

approached Berlin,f rom  the east,f rom the South. Com ingf rom the 
South, got in very, ver y fast.They couldn't get to the Jews. T here 
wasn't toom uchf ighting anyhow. I believe we  helped a little b
i t.  I t 
didn't do a very good job but actually helped us.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Inf act, you said you survi ved becauseof  your 
m other, luck, and them arshal.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: The eastern part of Berlin [Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Back to apoint you were m
ak i n g a f e w m om e nts ago,  
Fritz. T here's theT hird Reich literally collapsing. You were assigned to 
build the foundations for the new Berlin.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Foundationf ora new Berlin af terthe war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At what pointdid you believe or know that you really 

were saf e? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, when the war was over.W e were working 
close to an SS
 
--
 
whatdo you call it? Wherethey keeppeople.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Abarrack?
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Barrack. Lo and beholdwhat did we see?A 

g
roup of heavy trucks being pushed by SSmen. If SS doesn'thave 
any gasoline [Inaudible] then we realized it was pretty m uch over.
 
W e were delighted at their misfortune. Inever forget it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I've read several accounts of the Russianassault 
on  
Berlin and thenabout life in that devastated city in them onths 

following the war. If  you'll say the threatf romthe Nazis is over butnow 
you're occupied by the Soviets in an absolutely devastated city, what 
was lif e likef or you immediately af terthe
 
war? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Actually f oodat thebeginning was pretty bad.But 
actually af tera while the Russians cam e in
 
--
 
we were lucky.W e had 
som ef ood in ourplace we lived.W ehad to move m any times.Last 
apartm ent with two other couples. Anddownstairs was the horse 

butcher.T he Russians brought the woundedhorses to the butcher 
and we could eat
 
--
 
we had som e horse m eat.
 
Actually, what happened, at the tim e Jews still hadm eat, we 
could go to the horse
 
--
 
could have gotten double.One of our rela
t i ve s 
fedm eat to thefam ily and they never knew whatare youf eeding. Oh, 
thebutcher is very nice and gave us. Horsem eat.W hen you have 
nothing else, you eat it. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  How did the Russianstreat you? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  First I remember
 -- 
cam e hom eand the Russians 
were already at the apartm ent.But, of course, didn't believem e, Nazi, 

Jews, one of the people explained. Hebelieved that it wasn't SS.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had to convince them .
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes. Youngm an what are you doing here? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you or others that survi ved, did you consider 
taking revenge on theGerm ans? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  No.W e thought, yes. But we wouldn't lower 
ourselves to this. No. No.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You shared with me,and you wro
te  a b ou t it, too , tha t 

the winter of 1945 to 1946 was exceptionally a tough winter.W hat 

were conditions likethen? 
 
>> Frit z Glu ckste in :  A t th a t time
 
--
 
the Russians, Am erican, British 
andthe French. Russians black bread,Americans black bread.W e 

knew 
who was in charge. It was a horrible wi nter. And im agine, water 
pipesbroke,toilet couldn't be used. Can you im agine? People lived in 

a suburb [Inaudible]. W hat did you do?W ell, you could see people 

with little packages which they deposited in box in the
 
f ront lawns. 
Freezing was ok but you can imagine what happened after it thawed. 

But that was war.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henwas your father able to begin to resum ehis 

work and his lif eaf ter the war? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, af ter the war actually I was able to go back 
to school andm y father was reinstated, the tim ehe lost. Sorry. Old 
age.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was reinstated, got creditfor his tim e.
 
So asBerlin was being rebuilt andbeginning to com eback,and 
of  course it was divided up between control of the Soviets, French, 

British and the Am ericans. By 1948, you managed to com e to the 
United States.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Idecided. My parents let me go with heavy heart. 
My f ather said if I were 10 years younger, God bless you. But today I 
ca n 't. It'
s a com pletely different law. American law based on old 
English law. I couldnot carry on m y prof ession, but you go,he said," I 
hope you will choose a prof ession that isnot lim ited toone country."  
So I did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And to bea veterinarian. You
 
can be a veterinarian 
anywhere. Sound advi ce f rom  your dad. 
 
Your father and your mother stayed inBerlin.Did m any other 
Jews stay in Berlin? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Several. I would say theyounger lef t.T he older 
people stayedbecause difficult to start
 
a new lif e, anew language but 
the young people lef t. I would say, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wasstruck, you wrote in your book that after the war 

you're going back to school. You were in a class and in your 
classroom there were kids who like you, young m en
 
who hadn't had 
an education, and returning Germ an soldiersin the sam e classroom.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes. W ell, after three years no school, went to 

school, special courses in order to m ake up. We studied for the f inal 

exam ination. T here were German an
d Jews. And some of the German 

young m enhad to leave early. At thebeginning it was quite cool but 
then we realized they were not all Nazis andthey realized Jews are 
notactually diff erentfrom any other people.And we got along quite 
we ll.  
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  So what was it like to come to the United Statesf or 
you? You cam eover on a ship.W hat was it like? And you were how 

old, 21? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Iwas 21 onthe boat.30th January
 
1948. I 
rem em ber that. Standing on the ship. It was night. Looked in the 

street, cars moving. I wondered,betweenexpectationand 

apprehension. Som e people had great difficulties.
 
An organization I joined sent ustoa hoteland there we had to 
wait to be senttoa city where the Jewish congregation had agreedto 

take care of som enewcom ers. And said, well, you can goeitherto 
Detroit or St.
 
Paul, capital of  Minneapolis. I studied quite abit about 
the UnitedStates and I chose to goto St.
 
Paul. I knew it would be very 
cold in Minnesota but I had not heard yet,described
 
as having only 
two seasons, July andwinter.
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  It was ver y cold in Minnesota.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what your namem eans.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Good luck stone.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You talked about that in yourbook. Good luck stone.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Actually I had todecide,shall I changem y name? 
Should I call m yself gladstone? No. Should I keep Fritz?W ell in 

S t.
 
Paul I wentthrough the phone, and notmany Fritz's, m any 
Scandinavian, lived in St.
 
Paul andI kept
 
the name.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e mentioned you're an opera f an. T ell us how that 

started.
 

>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Jews were not perm ited to have radios. Ihad 
[Indiscernible].W ithout electricity it was wonderful. I listened every 
night.W henever we could expe
ct an air raid. T om orrow night they're 
going to broadcastanopera, "T osca."  I'm  going to listen. If I'm  lucky 

there will be no air raid. Ok, Iput on m y headphones and listened. And 
I was com pletely tranced by the music.T he opera, thediction was 
e xc e lle
nt. I couldfollow. Not half an hour I listened, two hours until 
" Tosca"  [Inaudible] andfrom  there Ibecameopera.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathas it m eantto you towrite your book, your 

m em oir?W hat has that meant to you? 
 
>> Frit z Glu ckste in : W e ll, I th in k 
people might want to see what 
happened.Actually m ore or less to tell.I came over hereand could 
m ake it, I would say. My m ore or less gratitude that in spiteof all, it 

wasn't easy but, yes, school, studying, had many jobs, elevator 
operator, busboy, [Inaudible], and helping Ph.D. candidates in their 
Germ an exam ination. Didn't charge enoughbut really was called to 

orderf orunderm ining the going rate. But I was abletom ake it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yes, you were. Ina stellar way. One last question and 

then 
we'll turn to our audiencefora couple of questions.
 
In light of thef act thatyou hadhom esbom bed out and you lost 
so much,how were yo u able to managetohave thosephotographs 

we saw earlier?
 

>> Frit z Glu ckste in :  Ye s.W ell, of co u rse, bombed  ou t twic
e . B ut, of 
course,m y good aunt,got pictures,and, of course, reproducedand 

gave back tous. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's the only reason you have those photos?
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Only reason. Otherwise nothing left. Bom bed out 

twice. Absolutely. 
 
>> F r i t
z Gluckstein:  Let's turn toour audiencef or af ew questions.W e 

have m icrophones ineach aisle.W e ask thatyou wait until you get a 
m icrophone if  you have a question. T ry tom ake your questionas brief  
as you can. I'll repeat it just to make sure thatwe understand it 
correctly, and then Fritz wil l respondto it.
 
Do we have anybody
 
--
 
we have ri ght here inthefront row. Ok. 
W ecanhear youbutthe back of the room may not so we have to put 

a m ic in your hand. 
 
>>  Af ter you cam e toAm erica, were you able to communicate with 
your f atherand your motheror today even your extendedfam ily that's 
still in Germany? 
 

>> Bill Benson: T he question
 
--
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst e in :   Ye s.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok. Fritz has got it.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  At that time telephone and letters. 
 
>>  [Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson: Was the system disruptedafter the war? Could you 

comm unicatef reely wit h your parents? Rightaf ter the war.
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst e in :   Ye s.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your fathereventually cam e tothe United St
ates.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Iwas stationed in theArm y at Fort Detrick and 
m y parents visited.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.Another question. Oneover here.
 
>> W hen did it become apparent to you andyour f am ily and your 

neighbors them agnitude of what was with to happen? 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid it becom eapparent to you and yourfam ily 
andothers around you them agnitude of  what was actually taking 
place with the Holocaust and what did take place? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, of  course, we knew something was g
oing 
on butactually we never knew exactly what happened. At the 

beginning we still could send som ef ood to people in Polish cities. 
Af ter a while, no call back. And,of  course, we had an idea butdidn't 
know f or sure.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How quickly, when the war ended, did you actually 
know what had happened? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Som e people cam eback, some were survi vors  

andtoldus what happened. And,of  course, it was publicized, of  

course,by the occupying forces what hadhappened. Made clear what 
happened.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you.
 
Another question?All right.
 
W ell, after wef inish today, Fritz wi ll go upstairs andhe is going 
to sign copies of his book. He will be available to sign it. So that will 
also be an opportunity to ask Fritz another question if you have oneor 
just say hi tohim .
 
Fritz, thank youf or being our First Person.
 
[Applause]
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs o n
 
that our First Person gets the 
last word. So I'm  going to turn back to Fritz f or the last word.
 
I want to thank all of you for being here, rem ind you we'll have 
program s eachW ednesday andThursday until August
 
1 0.  T he  
m useum 's website will have inf ormation about
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
in 2018 so 
we hope that if  you have the opportunity, you'll com ebackand joinus.
 
Andone more thing before Fritz gets up on the stage,and that 
is thatour photographer, Lolitta, will com e up on the stage, takea 
photo of Fritz with you as the background. So if  you would stay with us 
for that, that would begreat. And then we'regoing to try to get Fritz 
up 
as quickly as we can so he can sign copiesof his book.
 
Fritz, it's yo u rs.
 

>> Frit z Gluckstein:  It was m y good fortune to com e to the United 
States. I am f orever grateful f or the help I received and the opportunity 
gi ven tom e.I valuemy Am erican citi
zenship m ost highly.
 
I am  often asked whatI have learnedf rom m y experience. My 
answer is alwa ys the sam e. Don't do to others what you don't want 

done to yourself. Anddo itnow. Pay that visit. Make that call.W rite 
that letter. If  you have a dream , go af ter it now. And if you have two 

bottles of  wine,drink the better onef irst.
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
[Applause]
