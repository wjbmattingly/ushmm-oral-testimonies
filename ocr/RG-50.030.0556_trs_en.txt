Alexandria, Virgin ia
. Good mo rn ing. 
Answer: Good morning. 
Q: Thank you fo r joining us
. Can you tell me  where and when  you were born, and 
what your name was at birth? 
A: I was born in Œ in 
Ho rodenka
, 
Poland
, which is now th e
 Ukraine
, and I was 
born on April 25
th
, 1936. 
Q: Mm-hm. And what was your name at birth? 

A: 
Rena Koch.
 
Q: Okay . And what was your 
fami ly like? What did your parents do for a living? 
A: My father owned a textile store, my mo ther was with him in 
the business, and we 
had the housekeeper at home. 
And I had an older brother, 
who was four Œ four years 
older than  I was, and we Œ basicall
y, she took care of us at home. 
Q: Was your family religious? 
A: Well, my father went, you know, in Œ in 
Europe
 basically most people were 
religious, at least that™s
 what I was aware of. 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

A: My father did go to temple, an d pray
ed every mo rning and did go to temp le on 
Saturdays. Of course, kept kosh er. And I wa
sn™t really aware of 
that much more of 
what religious meant; I though t all Jews were religious. 
Q: So you celebrated th
e holidays, and Œ and Œ 
A: Yes, oh, definitely, this was part of Œ 

Q: Œ and Sh abbat, and Œ 
A: Œ Shabbat, yeah, that was a-all part of 
life and I felt that that™s the way it has to 
be. 
Q: So, how old were you when  you 
s Œ did you start school wh ere you Œ 
A: I never started s Œ 

Q: You never did. 

A: Œ I never went to school until after we we
re liberated. So basica
lly, at that point I 
was almo st nine years old before I went to
 school, without knowing how to read or 
write. 

Q: So, when  the war started, you Œ you we
re on th e Soviet side, or you were on the 
Polish side? 
A: We were on the Polish side, and th en th
e Œ the Soviets came in in Œ I guess in 
1940, maybe, I think. 
Q: Right. 
A: And tha Œ and of course, and then the 
Germans came in. The S
oviets, we were a 
little bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be ta
ken to Œ my father was afraid that they™d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
5
 
 
take him to
 Russia
, whatever. And we thought that maybe ca Œ jer Œ he thought that 
maybe ki Œ when  the Germans 
came in, they didn™t Œ th
ey  weren't going to harm 
Polish Jews, only th eir own 
Jews, you know, maybe in 
Germany
. Bu t of course we 
discovered very quick ly otherw
ise. And after awhile, whic
h I don™t really remember 
how long, they formed a 
ghetto in my  hometown, an
d everybody from all the 
villages and different neig
hborhoods Œ our house wa
s in the ghetto. And many 
people came to live with us, and there wa
s a lot of starvation. Cause I rememb er 
people basically dying, I don™t know how lo ng it took after the ghetto was forming, 

but on our doorstep there would be dead 
people that have Œ from hunger, you know. 
And they  were looking in garbag e cans 
for potato peels or 
onion peels. And we 
basically, since we were in our hometown
, I imagine my  Œ my  parents may have 
stored some food, so I don™
t remember being hungry at 
that point. Maybe I was too 
young to  rememb er hunger, you know, and then we had three acti Œ 
akcjas
 they call 
it, you know. The first one we 
Œ we had relatives outside 
of town , they Œ we went 
there, to outside of town. My
 father, I think, remained 
in town, but my grandfather, 
when we came back, we discovered my fath er™s father was killed, right across the 

street.  He was shot right across the street 
from our house. And th
en the second one, 
we went into  hiding someplace outside of
 the city. But the third one, my father 
brought us to a Christian fa
mily, and he Œ they said th
at all workers should come 
and register, and he felt that he was young 
and strong, and he was going to register. 
And after a day or two, he will come and get us. And it took about a week and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

never came back. So my moth
er worried, she took us out
 and we started walking 
out Œ out of the Œ their Œ wher
ever they hid us, in their 
barn. And they were shotti Œ 
shooting after us, you know, when  we Œ th ey
 saw that we were, you know, Jews, I 
guess. And we went back to ou
r home, but eventually this 
akcja
 mu st have stopped, 
or wh atever, but they came into our house an d they ch ased us out. Out of the house. 
And I was, you know, very y
oung, but my  mo ther told  me to grab Œ she had a Œ her 
girdle, wh ich she had gold dollars sewn into 
it Œ to take that. As a child I was able 
to sneak by with that. And th
is is basically Œ that eventually saved our life. And then 
they made 
Judenfrei
, our town was 
Judenfrei
, but my  grandmother on my  father™s 
side had survived , and then an
 aunt, my father™s sister. An
d we went into th e woods, 
and we Œ I guess my  mo ther mu st have know
n that across this river, was called the 
Kinester
(ph), there were Jews, w ere still Jews
 there. And you Œ 
you were able to 
get there. So we were in the woods right 
acro Œ from the river, and hiding in there, 
and a young student came across. He knew 
my  mo ther, and he said, you hide, he 
says, but during the night when the water 
gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will 
come and Œ and take you across. He carried
 me across, because I was the youngest 

one. My  brother, my  mo ther, my  aunt and my  grandmother, they walked across 
with packages, if they ha
d Œ whatever they had. An
d we came to a little town
, 
Potok Z
oty
, and before we know it, you know, a 
couple of days later, they ma de 
Judenfrei 
over there. And we went on to 
Bucza c z
, and in 
Buczacz
 we lived with a 
family that was in the ghetto
, there was a ghetto there. And there were also man y  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

akcjas
 and I remember that we always had to
 watch at night, people were watching. 
And I would go out during the day, of co
urse, and play  with other children. And 
right after the 
akcja
 I™d come out and they™d say, 
the children are dead, they™re Œ 
they™re gone. Or Œ and one day I came out 
and I saw a wagon full of dead children, 
with bleed Œ blood coming out of the Œ 
the wagon. You know, when  Œ so I was 
always ready, I was afraid I™d be left 
behind, being the Œ the youngest one. So as 
soon as they Œ I™d be Œ at 
night or whatever, I™d be the 
first one to get dressed and 
hold onto my  mo ther to go 
into hiding. And basically af
ter this Œ you know, after Œ 
I™m Œ I™m n o t sure of how much tim
e passed, they made that town  
Judenfrei
, and 
my Œ and we had an-another little town, my
 ki Œ father™s relatives, co usins were 
there, and they Œ I don™t 
how th ey communicated with my  mo ther, but she decided 
to go there. And we went to 
Ko py czy n ce
 was that name. And we went in Œ we 
stayed with them. And of co
urse then it started  over ther
e; the Œ the killings started 
over there. And my f Œ relativ
es™ son, they  Œ he was 17 or
 18 years old, with other 
boys they built a bunker from th
at house that we lived in 
to under the street, and we 
felt it was very safe, you know, in the 
baseme nt it was camouflaged, in the 
basement, and we were there. There were a couple of 
akcjas
 there, but this was like 
the last one. We we Œ all went into this  bunker, we were 30 some odd people that 
went in there. And they must
 Œ they built a air Œ you know, 
some type of air, to give 
us air in the street. And either the noise or  whatever, they discovered that we Œ that 

there was a Œ that we Œ there was a bunker 
under there, so they started digging from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
8
 
 
the other side the street and came in that 
side. And then they realized that there had 
to be an opening in a Œ in the house, you 
know, that we Œ how we
 got in there. So 
they discovered us on both sides. They  
pulled everybody out, and they started 
throwing hand grenades in
to the bunker. And basically, I don™t know wh at 
happened  to  my  mo ther, she either, you know
, went to another part of the bunker, 
whatever. A Œ but I was holding onto my  br
other. And people died, and the dead 
bodies fell on top of us. A
nd when  it had quieted down , 
people came to rob, you 
know, the dead, to see what was there. And 
they hit my  brother 
over the head with 
an axe, you know, to tr Œ th
ey thought that he was still 
alive. But I was covered with 
bodies, so they pulled my  foot, and th
ey pulled off my sh
oe. And basically, I 
survived with that one shoe
 on, through the war. And then
 we Œ we Œ wh en Œ after 
we were discovered, we were
 the only ones, they thought 
we were already dead, or 
whatever, they were a
ll dead people. At night we snuc
k out of there, went into a Œ 
into another building, out onto a roof. We 
stayed there fo r a long time without any 
food. Being the youngest one
, my  mo ther worried, you 
know, my Œ my throat was 
closing up from not eating or
 drinking. Bu t there was like a Œ a Œ a rusty tub, or 
whatever with the Œ with the water wa
s leaking from the roof. And she found a 
straw and made me drink the water with 
a st Œ through a straw, because it was 
feathers and dirt in that water. And then 
we were discovered there. But if Œ they 
only robbed us. There were some other 
people from the bunk
er that survived, 
another three men, I think wi-with us. An
d Œ you know, and they
 let us Œ they Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

they told us, this is
 the end, they™re gonna Œ going 
to keep killing un
til all the Jews 
are gone, he says. But there is a labor camp 
outside of Œ of Œ that some Jews are 
working on the labor Œ in the labor camp out
side of town. To us, of course, it was a 
strange town, we weren™t there very long.
 It was a ghetto Œ walled ghetto. But we Œ 
these two men that were with us on that 
roof came down with us and lo oked  for a 
place to go over the wall. And they  found lik
e an old couch or a chair, I don™t know 
what it was, and my mother was able, a
nd my brother, to get over. They threw me 
over the Œ th Œ over the fence, and we st
arted running away from the ghetto. And it 
was Œ a man was leading a cow, so he told  the guards at the Œ the gate, the Jews 
were escaping, and they start Œ they shot af
ter us. Well, we were able to get to Œ I 
think one of the man got Œ you know, was sh
ot, but we were able to get into the 
fields, and there was Œ the wheat was very
 high, and we hid there for a couple of 
days in Œ my  mo ther had the feeling th at 
we were heading to ward s that labor camp  
where Jews were still workin
g. We got there and we Œ we
 s Œ we got there at night 
and there was nobody, the Jews used to run 
away at night. They were always afraid 
that at night they™d come and get them. 
We were in a building that wasn™t quite 

finished yet. They  came to rob us again, 
and they Œ my mother 
had Œ at this point 
she had slipped the gold dolla
rs into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and 
they touched her boot that it was there. So 
they hit her to get off the boot and she 

refused. She said, we™ll scream. T h ey were
 allowed to kill Jews, but they weren™t 
allowed to rob. So they go
t scared and ran aw ay. And then mo rn ing came, and my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
10
 
 
mother went into the camp, in
to that labor camp  and ta Œ find out if she could work  
there. And the man that was in charge of 
labor Œ my  mother happened to have been 
a beautiful blonde woman, so 
he picked her she could wash
 the floor in her Œ in his 
office. And he started talking to  her, a
nd he said, you know, you could pass as a 
Polish woman. So she says, but I have two 
children. So he said, two children, he 
says, do you have a Œ so she says, I have 
a son and a daughter. Says well, no son, I 
cannot help you with  a son, but with  a daugh
ter. But a couple of days later he said 
to her, I Œ if you have any money left, he
 says, if you have any mo ney, I have a 
friend that would be willing to
 hide you outside into Œ 
in a Œ outside in another 
farm. And my mother said sh
e didn™t Œ she was afraid to
 say that she had the money 
with her. But she said, I have money in 
the ghetto, and I will 
sneak back in the 
ghetto and dig it out. Sh e wanted  to make su
re that he meant it. And sure enough, he 
did have a friend, he sends a wo rker from th
at other farm to pi
ck us up, you know, 
to Œ to take us Œ he wanted gold  dollars, 
he didn™t want Œ so we were very lucky to 
have gold and not paper money. 
And they took us to this ot
her f Œ to this other farm, 
or to Œ you know wh at Œ wh at it was, it wa
s Œ was a lot of people work ing for him, 
he was like the boss. And th ey put us in the room, they Œ it was an empty building. 

And there was a man that was assigned to  br
ing us food or take out our waste, or 
whatever. And he Œ the man di
dn™t tell us th at he was Je
wish passing himself off as 
a Œ he was the bookkeeper on that farm. 
But he was a Jew, and he passed hims elf 
off as a Œ you know, as a non Jew, but he 
was the one to provide us when ever he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
11
 
 
could. I me an, mo stly it was potatoes. An
d being the youngest one after we were 
there for eight months, and then they star
ted Œ rumo rs were he ki Œ brought back  
rumors saying that the Russi
ans were coming, that the Russians were  winning the 
war, and they were coming closer. And the 
partisans were in the woods, we were 
hoping we™d get liberated. Bu
t eventually, of course, the Œ the war came closer, and 
I think th at they Œ th at somebody mu st ha
ve discovered that there may be Jews in 
there. So they moved us to 
a still. But the Œ and the still 
in Œ these big barrels in a 
still, and Œ and then we went up to the Œ 
the roof, I don™t Œ and they were going to 
bomb the Germans when they we
re leaving, they were goin
g to bomb  that buildings 
because they didn™t want the 
Russians to get ahold of the 
liquor that was in there. 
And we heard them talking outs
ide, you know, that this is
 next, they were going to 
[indecipherable]
. And then th e bomb s started falling all around, they ran away . 
And we didn™t really know if we were Œ if
 the Russians were comi
ng, if the rai Œ so 
we stayed there for quite aw
hile with no fo od or anything, because they Œ they  
couldn™t bring it to us over there. Eventu
ally they came and th
ey told us you™re 
liberated, you™re free. And at that point I was swollen, my  stomach and my  feet 
were swollen. And we got outside and we h
itched a ride with the 
Russian soldiers as 
they were advancing to the next town. And 
Œ and that town th ey were Œ some Jews 
started coming out of Œ you 
know, there were a couple 
of families came out of 
hiding, and we stayed there. So basically
, th at was our liberation. And then we 
started running because the war was going on ri
ght near us. We tried to go closer to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
12
 
 
the Russian border. And other people were 
coming out of labor camp s, and they had 
typhus, and my  mo ther and I both got typhus
. And we Œ that part
 is completely like 
way Œ vague in my  mi nd. I know that I couldn
™t walk, that I lost my hair. But I, you 
know Œ and eventually, as it quieted do
wn, we worked ours
elves back to our 
hometown, hoping that there would some
body be left, some
body would be Œ you 
know, we didn™t know what Œ the fa
te of my father, we just Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ knew th at he didn™t come back, 
and my  mo ther™s sisters, grandmothers, 
everybody. You know, so we 
came back to town and some
 Jews finally unfil Œ you 
know, came back. Some of the Jews that Œ 
we stayed there for awhile, and that™s 
when the first Œ when it got a little bit Œ th
ey wanted the childre
n to go to school Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ so that was my first experience to 
go to school. And it was a Polish school at 
that point Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ but it was the Russians 
Œ within weeks they
 ch anged it to Russian school. And 
then we ha Œ we Œ since we were Polish c
itizens, we Œ we were able to get Œ go to 
Poland
, since this became 
Russia. 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: And they  got us onto  trains, you know, we got into  a train, you know, all the 
Jews, and we were Œ went to
 Poland
. And in  
Poland
 we were in 
Bytom, 
in a town
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
13
 
 
Byto m. 
And without having schooling, and 
I was Œ guess there was no food, my 
mo ther put us in an
 orphanage in Œ in
 Pola nd
. I forgot the name of the town. But 
next Œ ex  Œ actually, the next 
[indecipherable]
 there wasn™t much
 food in that 
orphanag e. The next town, and the next
, it Œ we went to an orphanage in 
Za b r z e
, 
and the Œ and stayed  there, but th-t
he funny part is, when I went to 
Houston
, I Œ 
some people came and they were searching fo
r people, they fa Œ had Œ had a picture 
of Œ when they didn™t rememb
er o f why they were there Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ of what they were there, and I was in
 the picture with them. So actu Œ there™s 
one woman here, 
Ida
 from
 Chicago
, who we found each other in 
Ho u s ton
 through 
one of these meetings. 

Q: Oh wow. 

A: And there was another man, 
George Ho ffman
, he™s not here t
oday, we were in 
that orphanage. And eventua
lly we left, of course, for 
Germany
. And I was in the
 
DP
 camp in 
Bad Reichenhall
 in 
Germany. 
Went to a school as Œ there was Zionist 
organizations formed, I was really  ho
ping as a Œ as a young ch ild to go to
 Israel
, 
you know, I wanted to be Œ to
 be a soldier or whatever. Bu
t my mother put is in the 
Œ in the orphanage 
Preen
(ph), which many children it wa
s like a tran sit thing to go 
to the 
United States. 
So as the Œ of the orphans quot
a we Œ I came in 1949, I came 
to the 
United States,
 and was sent to 
Minnea po lis
 as a foster child. And I lived 
with a Jewish family until 
my mother came to  the 
United States. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

Q: And was your brother with you, or Œ 
A: My brother was with Œ 
with me all this time. 
Q: So you tw o were t
ogether the whole time. 
A: He was Œ together, thi Œ that time, yeah Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ we were all together at that point, just my  brother and I. 
Q: Right. 
A: There are a lot of people here that have been  to 
Preen
(ph) yeah, wh ich was Œ 
yes. 
Q: Right. Did you ev er find out 
what happened to your father? 
A: Eventually, yes, a man in our hometown 
who surv ived, he was 
with my father in 
th Œ in that camp where they 
gathered them all when they
 discovered that it wasn™t 
really a work thing Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ that they were to register, but they
 were going to  take them to concen tration 
camp. My father was 41 years old, a strong man, so he s Œ looked out the window 
and he saw two policemen, Ukrainian policemen
 that he went to school with. So he 
spoke to one of them and he
 said, I have two watches with me, I™ll gladly give you 
my  watches, and I™m gonna 
jump out the window. He di
dn't  do it, but he pointed 
him out to th e next ma n, and as he wa
s running out the window he was shot.  
Q: Did any of your other family surviv e? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
15
 
 
A: Basically, you know, my mother was on
e of seven sisters. I-I h ave one cousin. 
We were Œ on my mother™s side, we were 19
 cousins. Wa Œ one 
cousin survived, he 
s Œ he lives in 
Florid a
 now, too. And now my mo ther
 has died, my  f Œ brother has 
died, and I Œ I have my  children, that™s it. 
Q: Mm-hm. I want to go back a little bit. 

A: Yes. 
Q: I guess this would probabl
y be pre-war. Wh at was the 
first thing you really Œ 
what™s the first memory 
you have as a child?  
A: Basically going visiting Œ to  visit re
latives. In the summertime going out to th e 
country, and you know, all wonde
rful, wonderful memo ries, you know. 
Q: Yeah. And when  the war st
arted, I guess I™m wondering Œ 
A: I went also to pre-school at one point, and it was a Hebrew Œ it was a Hebrew, I 
guess, a Hebrew pre-school, and I was Œ the 
thing I reme mb er is they taught us on 
the blackboard, you know, they
 made like Œ and th ey said 
sus
(ph), so they made a Œ 
a Œ you make a Œ a Œ you make a circle, 
you make a Œ a straight, you know, a Œ a 
line, and a little dot, and another circle. And that™s 
sus
(ph) and that means horse, 
that™s Œ that™s the extent of my education. 

Q: That™s a good Œ I like that. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
16
 
 
Q: That™s great. Do you remember your mo
ther Œ I-I guess I™m just Œ you were such 
a young child, what Œ I mean, that was onl
y, really the only life you really knew for 
a long time. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you reme mb er your mo ther just
 being Œ she sounds 
like a very strong 
woman. Do you rememb er her just being te
rrified all th e time? How were you Œ she 
was always looking out for you and your brother. 
A: Always looking out for Œ for us and Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ you know, fo Œ 
Q: Did you get the impression that she was scared? 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 we were all scared Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ we were all scared, so 
I™m really not sure where th
e fear came out of, but the 
fear was constant, you know, that™s cons
tant, of being discove
red, of being you 
know, seen, of being left behind
, of being killed, you know.  
Q: Right. 
A: In fact we Œ in that 
Buczacz
, in the town where I had se
en these dead 
children on 
the wagon Œ 
Q: Right.

A: Œ there were some relatives of ours that
 were there too, and they had a baby. You 
know, they had Œ had a baby. 
And right after one of these
 akcjas
 my  mo th er sen t  
me and my brother there, to see if they
™ve survived, and when
 we came in there, 
their baby was in the crib, de
-dead in the crib, shot in th
e crib. You know, so that™s 
constantly fearing that I was youngest 
one, that maybe, you know
 Œ you also heard 
that parents ran away, left their young ch
ildren. They wouldn™t
 let them into a 
bunker, because you may cry. In
 Bucza c z
 we were in bunker, there was a baby that 
cried at us, we Œ they were searching an
d we heard them. Themother put a pillow 
over him, and he died . It 
was a baby of Œ six weeks 
old baby. Was Œ was Œ you 
know, choked right there in that bunker. Yo u 
know, so it was always that fear o f, 
you know, of that.  
Q: Was that the Œ I mean, was the bi
ggest fear losing y
our family, or Œ 
A: I don™t Œ you know, this is so very stra
nge that I don™t have Œ I was just speaking 
to a friend of mine who™s also Œ who is 
my  age. She interviewed yesterday and she 
said, I don™t reme mb er, did I miss my  mo the
r, father, my  sisters? She says, how did 

I feel? I feel the same way, did I really? A
ll I remember is years later, you know, if I 
was angry at my  mo ther I was Œ always 
felt my father™s gonna come, he™s gonna 
come back. You know, an-and fo r many years 
actually, I was already an adult, I Œ 
knowing already that he had been killed, 
I always thought maybe it was wrong, he™s 
gonna come back. 
Q: So you came to the 
United States 
and you lived with a foster family. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

A: Fa-Fa-Family in 
Minneapolis. 
Q: And how was Œ I mean, did they Œ 
A: They did it mo stly for 
money, it wasn™t, you know Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ they Œ I don™t know if they were in
 great need, or wh atev
er, but they took Œwe 
were not the first set o f foster children th
at they had taken in from this Œ I Œ I think 
it was the group, the 
Joint
 or th e
 HIAS
, or whoever, sent us th
ere. When we got to 
New York
, actually, they asked us if we had any family in the 
United Sta tes,
 if we 
wanted to stay; we had nobody. 
Q: Right. 
A: So I Œ and it was very, very hot. I came from 
Germany
 in a wool outfit with 
wool socks, and it was like 98 degrees and 
humid, I had never experienced humidity 
before. And I said, just send 
us away, as far away from 
New York
 as possible. So 
they sent us to 
Minneapolis. 
Q: Did you Œ wh at language are you sp ea
king at that point? Were you only 
speaking Œ 
A: I Œ Po lish and Yiddish. 
Q: Polish and Yiddish. 

A: And yeah, of course I understood maybe 
German, you know, wa Œ this is part of, 
you know Œ 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
19
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So when you got Œ 
A: And no English Œ 
Q: No English. 

A: Œ no English at all. And I reme mb er
 going with my fost
er mother to the 
supermarket. As a child I mu st have 
been learning very  quick ly. And a man 
approached and asked me something, and I 
understood, and she was so excited that 
I understood wh at he asked me. 

Q: So, what language were you speaking 
with your Œ with your fo ster family? 
A: Yiddish Œ 

Q: Yiddish. 

A: Œ probably Yiddish, yes. I think Yiddish. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I have th is friend of mine here and 
I said, you know, who 
Œ I know her from the 
DP
 camp. And I said, what language did we 
speak? She says, Russian. I says, I di Œ 
never spoke Russian, so you couldn™t have be
en speaking to me 
in Russian. So we 
m Œ stis Œ we discovered it mu
st have been Yiddish too, 
that we spoke to each other, 
but I thought we spoke Polis
h, you know, or whatever. 
Q: Right, right. And so yo
u started going to  school. 
A: I started going to  school Œ 
Q: And Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
20
 
 
A: Œ of co urse they ma de Œ advanced 
pretty quickly. They
 put me in Œ in 
Minneapol Œ
 of course, I went to Œ in the 
DP
 camp, I went to school in 
DP
 camp. 
And that was a Œ really an accelerated course. So when I got to
 Minneapolis,
 I 
think it was sixth or seventh grad e that they
 put me in immediately. I™m not sure of 
how well I did, but I was there. But co
ming back then late
r, when my mother 
arrived and we came back to 
New York,
 I went into ninth grad e in junior high 
school. 

Q: Right. 

A: And there was a Jewish teacher and he 
mu st have been very Œ and I remember 
writing fo r Thanksgiving, it was my  first Th
anksgiving in the u Œ you know, maybe 
second Thanksgiving Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ in the 
United States.
 And I wrote my  story in  my  broken English or wh atever, 
but he praised me so much, it gave me so 
mu ch courage. He thought that I did so 
well, you know, of what I was thankful for.  

Q: Yeah, that must have been Œ that must 
have been kind of Œ I don™t know, I guess 
Œ 

A: Very, very 
hard, you know. 
Q: Yeah, culture shock, really. 
A: Every ti Œ culture shock. Every time they call on you in  class Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

A: Œ or they put me in 
the Œ and this was in the 
Bronx
, there was a Œ everybody was 
taking Span ish at that point. I had never he
ard Sp anish before, but th ey handed me a 
book. And of course, reading was very ea
sy because it™s the same as you would 
Polish. You know, I read Œ the teacher 
didn™t discover that I didn™t know any 
Spanish, probably for weeks. She just tho
ught I was very Œ I read very well, better 
than the American childr
en, because I Œ it™s the 
way you Œ phonetically. 
Q: Right. 
A: It was so easy for me.  

Q: So you Œ so you went to scho
ol. Did you go Œ di
d you want to? 
A: And then  I went on Œ then I went 
on to, you know, in
to  high school, in 
Ta ft
 High 
School in th e 
Bronx
. But I got married, of course, very young. I was 17 years old 
when I got married. 

Q: Wow. And how did 
you meet your husband? 
A: I needed a dental for Œ for school. They
 wouldn™t give me Œ they wouldn™t Œ you 
had to go Œ you know, you wo
uldn™t get a grade in gym, unless you got a dental. So 
I went Œ my  mo ther took me along to a dentist, and he spoke Yiddish, and th at™s 
why my  mo ther, of course, chose him. 
Q: Right. 

A: And he was a young man, 
and he said, if Œ I™ll only gi
ve you a dental if you™ll 
meet my  cousin. And th is was his c
ousin, and eventually
 I married him. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
22
 
 
Q: Wow. You hear a lot of stories like th
at, it™ s Œ it™s so neat, and how everybody 
was matchmaking thro ugh Œ th roughout 
New York. 
Did you Œ did you even tually 
grow to like 
New York
? 
A: I never really got to liking 
New York
. I mean, of course I di Œ eventually, we 
lived in the 
Bronx
 and I had children and ev erything
. But I was very happy when I 
Œ wh en we moved aw ay. We mo ved away to  Œ first to 
Rutland
 county, and 
eventually we, for ma
ny years we lived in 
Poughkeepsie, New York
. I was v ery 
happy outside of Œ I also didn™t mingle that
 much with Œ because
 there weren™t that 
many survivors, you know, 
my husband was American, 
so I didn™t mingle that 
mu ch with, you know Œ but I was happy, I blended Œ I th ought I blended in, I Œ I n Œ 
I never admit it. If th ey didn™t ask me, I 
never said I was a survivor unless they 

asked me. 

Q: Right. And so  you don™
t really remember d i Œ  
A: What Œ 

Q: You know, that™s always Œ always one
 Œ something I Œ I wonder about is, how 
did you explain it to people wh en  they
 did ask, who didn™t know ab out it, 
necessarily? 

A: People knew, but I Œ I basically never 
told my children neve
r told my husband. 
This is Œ today is the first time that I™m 
ready to speak about it. I Œ wh en they  called 
me from 
S p ielberg
, when they would come to to
wn, three times I cancelled my 
appointment. I never Œ I still don™t feel ve
ry comfortable, and 
my ch ildren know it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
23
 
 
They™ve never asked, because 
they felt it was painful for 
me. But now I have one of 
Œ little grandson, who Œ he lives in
 Houston
. He Œ I think his parents came back of 
seeing a movie about the Holocaust, and th Œ 
we discussed it, and he realized that it 
was me. So since then he™s been prodding
 me, when can you tell me  the story? I 
always tell him, not today, hi Œ I™m not 
Œ not today, so me other time. And ev ery 
time I come to town, or he comes, he says, 
I Œ is Œ is this the 
time yet? And I always 
say not yet Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ it™s not Œ the time is not yet. In fact, I rememb er going to a Seder one time, and 
one of the young Œ the Œ as
ked me, knowing that I was a survivor, asked me some 
questions, and I Œ and I told him a couple 
of things that had happened to me, and 
my husband sat there and he was amazed th
at he had never Œ after many years being 
married, he had never heard this from me. A
nd he also never questioned me of what 
I went through. My mother di
d a little talking, you know Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and she spoke to  my  children too, but I Œ 
Q: When  you ra Œ and did yo
ur brother talk about it? Di
d you and your brother talk 
about it? 
A: My brother Œ my  bro Œ no,
 we never spoke about it. Th
e two of us to Œ to Œ to 
each other, we never sp oke about it. But I 
think my brother was a little bit more 
affected by it, whatever. He was a little de
pressed, he was Œ he got married, he had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556 
24
 
 
a fami ly, but he definitely had a lot of the 
syndromes that I see in
 survivors. He was 
Œ he was four years older than I was. 
Q: Right. 
A: He was definitely, I felt, more affect
ed by it. In fact, I don™t even like when 
people, you know, whatever 
is wrong with me, when peop
le thi Œ say, you know, 
oh, it mu st be due to the Holocaust, I don™t like to Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ blame this on the Holocaust. 

Q: And you never experienced any kind 
of like nightmares or anything like th at 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Oh yes, yes, yes, they Œ to th is day 
I get, you know, and I™m amazed that after 
many years, you know, I find my self running, 
or you know, or Œ or shooting, yes, I 
Œ I do. The nightmares ha
ve never really stopped. 
Q: Yeah. I Œ I want to go b
ack a little bit to moving from 
town to town. You were Œ 
you said you were ready at any moment to go. 
A: To go or to hide
 or whatever, yes. 
Q: To hide, to hide. It Œ if it Œ do you reme
mber at any point just getting tired of Œ 
of moving, or wanti
ng, liking a particular
 place where you were? 
A: Oh, yes, yes, every time, every time we
 w ould get settled as a ch ild, you know, if 
we had a room, I was, in my little ways, I 
would take a Œ a kerchief and cover the 
table, I wanted it to be ours, you know. Li
ke to set the table, 
to do something to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0556

decorate it, to make it ours, because we 
never Œ never experienced that, definitely. 
Every place that Œ if we stayed for long 
period Œ a longer period of time, eva Œ I 
wanted this to be 
my home, definitely. 
Q: Do you remember how l
ong you stayed  in the Œ in
 the Œ the longest time y ou 
stayed in one place? Do you Œ 
A: Well, once we started running, it wasn™t
 really Œ I can™t Œ I don™t really Œ 
Q: Right, right, so young. 
A: Œ I can™t tell the time
, I can™t tell the time. 
Q: But it was just Œ 
A: I know th at, you know, ove
r Œ from 1942, basically to th
e last month Œ to the Œ to 
the Œ we were liberated in March, 
the end of March of 1940 Œ ™44. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So we were in all th ese places, but I 
can™t Œ I don™t know of
 how long in each 
place, I really can™t tell. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. And did you have Œ di
d y Œ were you la Œ allowed to bring 
something th at was yours Œ 
A: I never had a toy Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable] 
Never had a toy. 
A: Œ never had a toy. Never 
had Œ basically, mo st times we didn™t have a s Œ didn™t

you know, talk to me about numbers. I ne
ver learned the alphabet, of course, until 
after we were liberated, or learned to 
read. But she tried to Œ numbers, you know, 
addition, subtraction. 

Q: Right. 

A: She tried even the multip
lication tables, you know, to
 teach me. This was all 
because most of the time, nothing. I never had Œ 
Q: Do you reme mb er any of the people 
that you were hidden with ? Have you Œ 
have you gone back to 
Poland
 to look where 
they were, or Œ 
A: No, I™ve never been back to that part of

A: Œ but there are people from my hometown in
 Israel
 who said at one point they 
were going to make a trip, and I said that 
I would love to go to. But I don™t think it 
ever happen ed. They  may have gone indi
vidually, but that™s
 never happened .
