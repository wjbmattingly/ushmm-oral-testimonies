A: As a matter of fact Œ 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
9 
Q: You probably are. 
A: As a ma tter of fact, I show you.
 Before I left -- it's nonsense, but
 I took it with me         
because my daughter didn't see it.  I was here
 last time on a trip, and last time w e was 
here (inaudible) -- I already lost it. 
Q: Is it a picture of your group? 
Is this it?  Here's a group. 
A: See.  There's my son.  So Œ 
Q: Oh.  Great. 

A: And that's  my  picture. 
Q: There you are.  Oh, that's  wond
erful.  And that's here or that
's in your         Kansas 
City Œ 
A: No.  That's here Œ 

Q: Oh.  Wow. 

A: -- In Washington.  We had 
a group of 28 people, the mayor
 from the city.  You See.  
Read this and Œ 
Q: A delegation of business and community le
aders from the Kansas City area including 
Mayor Emanuel Cleaver.  Which one is he?  Ri
ght on th e end.  Great.  And then there 
was a dinner here, as well? 
A: Yes.  Oh, we had a couple days very
 mu ch entertained and bein g (inaudible). 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
10 
Q: Oh yeah?  That's w o nderfu
l.  That was great.  I bet 
your daughter appreciated seeing 
that. 
A: Yes.  I said I have to take this to Œ 

Q: Yeah.  That's great.  
So they  send you th at to 
keep you updated, as well? 
A: Yes.  Mm-hmm. 
Q: Well, you are active.  So you 'v e already signe
d a release, and so I assume that this can 
be used for research purposes, that sort
 of -- great. So that's the formality. 
A: There's nothing there that cannot be used  fo
r anything.  It's just I didn't  -- I was not 
ready, let's say this way, to even  come out 
and let my children be aware what -- I always 
give them my advice of life, and I teach th em what can happen to people, how people 

lived before them, so on,
 so forth, back and forth, but 
I never tell them that that much, 
what I put in their mind.  It
's because what I went person
ally, because sometimes they 
wouldn't take it as Œ they would say, oh, y
ou so prejudice because you went through this, 
but that's not necessarily true.  It can happen.
  It just happened.  But it was taken from me 
that I'm a strict mother, and 
I'm expecting th em, I'm telli
ng th em, and I'm advising th em, 
and they took my for granted.
  So maybe I had the wrong 
philosophy, maybe I dealt with 
them a different way, but now it
's  not too late.  They already 
have -- I have         
grandchildren an age where, wh
atever, however they feel, they
 already raised my way.  
So it's a tw o-way.  
Q: Yeah. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
11 
A: We can see it both ways. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It's not necessarily true, like I say, that I 
was so right how I handle it, but they didn't 
lost anything.  My kids are very well aware 
of what life has to offer and know a lot of 
things.  You can see my son. 
Q: Yeah.  He's doing well. 
A: He's a lawyer.  He's  doing pretty good.  He's
 involved in a lot of things that have to do 
with Judaism and life and other.  He's tryi
ng to think of mo re than one thing only. 
Q: And I'm sure that's as a 
result of how you'v e raised hi
m.  So was there anything in 
particular that made you, besides his enco
uragement, that made you come forward and 
start talking? 
A: No.  I lost my husband Œ 

Q: I see. 

A: -- 15 months ago. 

Q: That's q u ite recently. 

A: Yes. 

Q: I'm sorry. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
12 
A: That was basically something 
I felt.  There's more to it, w
hy I keep this in my mind all 
the time, w h at I went through, what he went
 through and how we survived and what our 
life offered us.  And God was good to us.  We
 had something to be 
thankful and we want 
to teach the world to know that
 life is not  -- nothing is fore
ver and there is mo re to it.  
We cannot treat each other as we think we wo
uld like to. We have to treat them what's 
right. 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah. 

A: And gradually, like they say, if yo
u put bread on the 
water it comes back. 
Q: That's true.  Did you talk to each other, 
you and your husband, ab
out your         
experience? 
A: Yes.  We did.  We always
 had conversations in a different
 way, just saying now listen, 
let's see.  After all, we thought it's not worth 
it.  We shouldn't fight for it.  It's just such a 
miserable, uncomfortable life.  
It's so embarrassing to live that kind of life.  Why fight?  
Then we come -- our answer was in our convers
ations after.  It was 
worth it.  True, we 
lost a lot, true, we went through a lot, but 
the ones we lost, we're he
re to talk for them. 
Q: That's true. 
A: They died in vain , and we 
have to protect and talk about. 
Q: That's why it's important to ma ke a testimony.  I 
agree.  I agree.  So your date of         
birth, when were you born? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
13 
A: June 1, 1920. 
Q: January 1920? 

A: June.  

Q: Oh, June 1920.  And wh ere were you born? 

A: I was born in Hanover. 

Q: In Germany? 

A: Germany. 

Q: And your name at birth was Maria Braun? 

A: Braun. 
Q: And were there any other names that you 
used between 1933 and '45?  Some people 
change their names if they went into hidi
ng or anything.  No? Did you grow up in  
Hanover? 
A: No. 

Q: No?  Wh ere did you grow up? 

A: Wodzislaw.  Do you 
know how to spell this? 
Q: I don't.  Wish I did. 

A: I was afraid.  Give me a pencil. I have to
 -- there's going to  be mo re names than this. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
14 
Q: Right there.  My father would be 
able to spell it. 
 He speaks Polish. 
A: Yeah? 
Q: Yes. 

A: You don't -- You read this 
as a T, and that's not a T. 
Q: Right.  My name in Polish is Malgorzata, a
nd it's got one of those in it.  So that's in 
Poland.  And th at's the only to wn
?  Did you move at any point? 
A: No.  I was in Sosnowiec, too. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Another city. 

Q: Can you spell that one, too?  Are they
 in central Poland?  Okay.  Thank you. 
A: You will see on the glass windows those names. 
Q: Those names.  Okay.  And 
now I'm just going to ask yo
u some questions about your 
life as a child before the war.  What 
was the occupation of
 your parents? 
A: My father was in World War II. He was a -- he wa
s -- their family was five brothers.         
He was the oldest one.  And as a rule, in a very religious family, they cannot take more 
than one son to the Army.  An
d he was the oldest one, so he went to World War I.  He 
was in the Army. 
Q: In World War I? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
15 
A: Yes.  He was captured as a prisoner.  He 
was also hurt by some kind of bombing.  He 
Had -- His left hand was ruined.  Two fingers 
was cut off by wh atever, and he had a mark 
on his back, back here.  Or was it two?  Bu t it 
was pretty severe. As a matter of fact, he 
was there for two years in Russia.  He was ca
ptured  by the Ru ssian, and he was there for 
two years.  After he come back from there, 
he married in that little city of Wodzislaw, 
and from there they moved to Hanover, and th
at's where i was born, in Hanover.  Of 
course, being in volved  in such  a situation, the Po
lish government assigned, like here we         
have the veterans, what they get some kind 
of benefits, the Po lish govern ment give them 
also some kind of a benefit.  And his bene
fit was like he had permission all legalized, 

certain things, what was not permitted to be sold in ev ery store, like liquor, cigarettes, 
salt, sugar, tea, coffee.  This was items, of 
course, to ask here no
w it's nothing, but in 
those years, 50 some years back, especially in
 small city, this was big demand and it was 
very difficult to get. He had a 
pension, too.  He probably  wa
s pretty hurt and pretty mu ch 
damaged since they give him all Œ  
Q: From the Army? 
A: -- The privileges.  Yes.  Ye
s. But the point is so my mo
ther -- and he was a religious 
person coming from a very religious home. So those people conducted more religion 
than cared about 
business, and my mother
 took over the busine
ss and she operated the 
store with all those imports.  All those th
ings has to come in from Germany, from 
Czechoslo vakia, from Italy to Poland.  Po land had mo st of them, mo re like wheat, 

potatoes and other sources of food, but a
ll of those luxury things was coming from 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
16 
different countries, and we had th e privilege of
 having open business for all those things.  
So that was our business.  We lived very  co
mfortable with it.  My mother was a good 
busin ess woman.  She was operating all th
ose things. We lived in a very good 
neighborhood in  that city.  We had a good client
ele.  As a matter of 
fact, the majority of 
our clientele was not even Jewish people, be
cause we didn't live in an area where too 
many Jews was living.  This was like the high
er class of neighborhood.  And we operated 
business for years. And it was three children,
 two brothers and me.  We all went to 

school.  We all graduate from -- o f course, in
 Poland it was seventh grade.  After seventh 
grade you graduate.  And by that time you 
was 14 years old, because you start when  
you're seven.  And after graduation I went
 back to gymnasium.  I had two years of 
gymnasium.  I couldn't  go too much farthe
r, because the time got where they start 
everything in Germany, and the rules and regul
ations start getting pretty bad for Jews.  
Even  in '36, '37 we didn't feel
 that much, but there was alrea
dy a lot of things going on in 
Germany with the Kristellnacht and other thin
gs.  The news was coming this Hitler is 
took over the country, and it started getting very
 difficult for Jewish People, for particular 
busin ess people, professional people, whatever. 
Q: Even though you didn't l ive in a neig
hborhood where there were primarily Jewish 
People living? 
A: Doesn't make any difference.  

Q: It didn't matter. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
17 
A: Frankly, I tell you, if this is taped, what 
I'm saying, I cannot say what I want to  say. 
Q: Really? 
A: No.  I -- that would be a joke what I want to 
say, and I hate to put a joke in         
something like this.  When yo
u say you live in the neig hborho
od, so it's an answer for 
this.  At the very end I tell you that answer. 
Q: Okay .  Okay . 
A: I don't know wh ere I am now. Anyway , so my  school stopped.  I went two years to  
gymnasium.  I had one mo re year to finish
 and I could be a mathematic teacher. 
Q: Really? 
A: I went for math, but not allowing any mo re
 Jews to attend school, types of school.  
They  cut it off in certain cities and certain sc
hools.  So I had to do something else.  I 
stepped in and helped  my  mo ther to operat
e the business.  And I was working with her 
and so was my brothers.  On
e of my brothers was worki
ng as a bookkeeper in a little 
factory.  Wh at you call it?  Steel, iron, stuff 
like this for building suppliers.  He finished -- 
he actually didn't  finish. He had the same pr
oblem.  He couldn't fini
sh everything, but he 
finish business school.  So they  hired him for th
is.  So he work ed th
ere.  I worked with 
my  mo ther.  My youngest brother was 14, 13,
 14.  Wh en the world broke up he was 14 
years old.  
Q: Were you the oldest? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
18 
A: No.  My brother was the oldest. 
Q: You were in the middle? 
A: I'm the middle, yes.  After Œ we heard 
the bad news, but there was -- nothing specific 
was -- we didn't have any televisions or that t
ype of information we 
have now, that mu ch 
newspaper, news medias and ev
erything goes with it.  We ha
d a radio. Every once in a 
while there was a broadcast, but we just coul
d hear wh at they want us to hear.  We 
couldn't have the true story.  So the fact is th
at we lived with the id
ea of, oh, it will pass.  
It's just some kind of a bad situation right 
now, and we'l l go back  to history, if somebody 
is educated, you know, happened
 to  so and so, and so an d so, and all through life, all 
through thousands of years, but didn't pass 
so easy. 1939, September 1, German Army 
stepped in our city, took over the city, and 
from that day on we seen killing, we seen 
unusually th ings wh at we never expe
cted or lived th
rough, i mean, as far as I can say.         
I never known that a person kills a person.  Life
 was taken by God.  This is something if 
you get old and you get sick you 
die.  I was too young to un
derstand this, you take a gun 
and -- we didn't know too mu ch  about guns.  We know that you're going to die when  you 
get a gun, but living in the c
ity was peaceful.  Life was just different, totally -- maybe 
now it's a little differen t, too, than
 my vision is, but 50 years ago Œ  
Q: Right.  Right. 
A: -- It was totally different. 

Q: So you were 19? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
19 
A: I was 19 years old. 
Q: Did you notice, was there any clue before 
-- was there any Antisemitismus or         
Anti-Semitism or anything that gave you a clue
 about what the Germans were doing or Œ 
A: Like I say, we heard what they 
want us to hear.  They didn't te
ll us they're k illing         
people.  They didn't tell us they'r e sending 
out anybody to camps. 
 It  was just stories 
going around. Of course, the Polish people 
was not very kind to  us in that time. 
Q: They weren 't? 

A: No.  There was hope Œ not exactly, if I w a
nt to say -- it's not exactly all the Polish 
people.  You had a group of Vo lksd eutsch
e, and if you know what that means.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: If you have a name -- like my  name is
 Braun, so I could be German.  Okay? 
Q: Right. 
A: If you married somebody 
from the German people and 
you're half German, or 
whatever, and -  live in Poland, then you we
re Volksd eutsche, not a full-Deutsche.  And 
those people was taken a lot advantage. They  
were stupid.  There was not too many -- of 
course, in the city I lived, I have to say, it
's  farm towns. There's not too many educated 
people, not too many intelligent who understand it's a war a
nd we're all going to suffer.  
It's going to be a lot of trag
edy going on, but they say it's opp
ortunity. They  have a store, 
we take everything away from 
them; they have jewelry, we 
take everything; if they are 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
20 
bankers, whatever the case would be.  And th
at was going on. And th rough th e schooling 
there was the same thing. there were students 
in even a nice school where I used to go 
that was doing a lot of uncomfortable things fo
r the Jewish kids.  Like they co uld take a 
match and put it under your coat.  It was a 
jo ke, but they did this to a Jewish girl. 
Q: And the school where you went, it was an 
assimilated school?  It wasn't particularly-- 
A: No.  I went to a school wh
ere it was Jews and non-Jews. 
Q: Right.  Right. 
A: There was -- i went to another 
school.  It was a Hebrew school. 

Q: I see. 
A: But that was all through my years, sin
ce fiv e years, from 5 to 17 years, and I was 
graduating to the highest whatever, that's av
ailable. That school was just for Hebrew, 
nothing to do with anyŠ 
Q: Right. 

A: -- Public class schooling. 

Q: And in th e public school who 
were your friends would you say? 
A: I had quite a lot of non-Je
wish friends.  As a matter o f 
fact, i was very popular at 
school.  I was a good student, that's number on
e, and I was well dressed, and that means a 
lot, even now. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
21 
Q: It sure does. 
A: And we lived in neighbor
hoods where I had mo st of non-Jewish friends.  We was 
doing our homework  in my  house. 
 We lived in a pretty good
 size house.  All the girls 
was coming to my  house, and I was the popul
ar one, do the mathem
atics for them, the 
painting, all those things. 
Q: Sure.  You wanted to be a math teacher.  Right? 
A: I was good in  it.  So i had a lot of friends.  
The fact is that just in short time       
everything changed.  When Hitle
r come in, they start --of cour
se, he come in in '39, and 
right there and then start a little u n comf
ortable situation where Main Street was 
separated, trying to block off the windows of
 those people that liv
e on Main Street, if 
they're Jewish families, so they
 have no view to the front. Th
ey  have to have a view to 
the back.  And questions start getting around
 in the neighborhood.
  Oh, you see what 
done at the so and so , what done at the so 
and so? And children are children.  What they  
understand?  They say, uh-oh, 
something wrong with  those people.  They  mu st be sick.  
There mu st be something.  They  didn't want to 
have a part of it, till we find out, all of us, 
the young and old, there is no -- it 's not an easy 
thing.  It 's going to 
be more seri ous than 
that.  By then it was too late. Of course, 
it was going on for months, and later on they 
start taking us out to wo rk, my  two brothers 
and me.  They didn't use my father or my 
mother in '39, just used the 
children.  We was working on 
the railroads.  We was working 
on streets.  Like, for example, here they have pa
ved streets.  In that 
part of the city they 
had like stones, brick stones and undern eath sand.
  We'd  throw in the stone and just make 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
22 
a street for them.  And naturally this was 
good to take a bunch of kids like us.  The 
women was throwing the sand and the men was 
putting in the stone.  Of course, they 
didn't  pay us, and we had to be there nine o'
clock, eight o'clock in the mo rning.  We had 
to group all in some kind of a place. 
Q: How did they tell you th at you Œ 

A: They'd  go from house to house. 

Q: They'd  go from house to house? 

A: It was the Polish police. 

Q: It was the Polish police? 
A: For sure.  They had to co
operate with the German, otherw
ise they would be killed.  
When they take over the countr
y then nobody has the power but
 th em.  And they  want to 
live and was really cooperating fo r one reason. 
 They want to exist.
  And the other was 
cooperating to make money or to  take advantage of. 
 And a lot did take advantage on it.         
And, of course, they paid the penalty later. 
 That's  another story. So  from one thing to 
another, when they was through with one j
ob they looked for a
nother, whatever was 
necessary to do in that
 city.  They send us away on the 
railroad, and we was working on Œ 
not far from us was a station, six miles from the city.  
Q: Did you live at home while you work ed? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
23 
A: No.  We had to go there ev
ery mo rning to work  and come 
back in the ev
en ing.  Later 
on, when start getting a little bit more serious
, they kept my brothers there, th e two 
brothers, and they released me.  And th at was 
already in '40, in th e middle '40.  And the 
city start getting a little more crowded and food -- shor
tage of food.  We had problems.         
People have to bake their own bread, be
cause you couldn't buy too mu ch, because the 

army used a lot and naturally didn't worry 
about anybody else but for them to be 
protected.  And some of them shifted even, to
ok stuff away, because 
they didn't have to 
pay anything if they went into
 a bakery or went to any place 
else. They didn't  have to pay 
nothing.  Fo r example, one good day two of those Ge
stapos come into our store and they         

cleaned up everything.  They  had a truck in 
front of it, threw everything in the truck. 
Q: Everything? 
A: Yes.  And I was stupid enough to stay in
 front of my mother, and I say -- my mother 
was taking away some -- everything was in 
bulk, not in  packages.  She was taking off 
from the bulk a little bit of tea, coffee, chocolate, whatever, things.  And he said, no, no, 
she cannot do th is.  So I kind of asked him -- I asked 
him, why?  She needs it.  She has         
three children to feed.  And he took a strap 
and cut on my face back and forth.  I had 
stripes here for month, didn't  heal.  And he
 said you -- the people was telling me later I 
was lucky.  He could have k
illed me, because he did this on 
other occasions. So there was 
no question about it that life was unsecure, no
 justice.  You coul
dn't ask anybody why 
he's doing th is to me, what I done wro
ng. I'm a normal person like everybody else. 
Q: They took ev erything you 
had. How did you su rviv e? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
24 
A: That's the second question. We 
-- like i say, we was -- that's wh
at we had --        (tape 
went quiet for a moment.)  We were still 
connected with farmers, and money, some 
money we had. Everything wh at we
 had on pekao we lo st, because 
       military generals 
took over it.  It's lik
e stocks and bonds, govern ment thin
gs.  That was pekao.  And this 
was what my father was receiving for his pension, 
went      straight 
to pekao.  And, of 
course, this was military that claimed it, be
cause nobody -- no jewish
 people can take out 
any mo re money from there.  
W e were secured by all type of -- what everybody else.  If 
you're wealthy, you have a little b it more cl
othes than somebody else, if you have some 
jewelry, some money in the house.  In the 
old country not every
body put money in the 
bank. 
Q: Right. 
A: You kept something for secu
rity. That for a while was -- we lived.  We could buy food 
from the farmers.  We could ex
change for goods what we still had, till it got from one to 
another that they decided that we had to se
parate the jew s from the gentiles and make the 
ghetto in  the city.  Everybody has to move in
 a few block circle, wh
atever it is, and give 
up th eir belongings and the houses.  We had a big house.  We had to  move in in  the 

quarters where our janitor was living and give th
is to the Germans.  We lived there with 
seven people.  We lived in tw
o rooms till '42, when  they star
t Ausweisung.  They come in 
with Au sweisung, partial deportation, like ta
ke the young people, then take the older 
people, then clean up co
mpletely.  They like to say -- in Ge
rmany they would         say 
that Judenrein, if you know wh at that means. In
 1942, September, we was contacted         

Interview with Maria Devinki  
25 
with some people that had au
thority, the Polish authority, 
because since we was in the 
busin ess a lot of those people was buying on 
credit, never paid us, because -- of course, 
we didn't expect them to, but we had still cont
act with them.  We ta
lk ed to them.  They 
tried to help us by virtual telling us storie
s.  And one of those policemen was telling us 
there was jewish people involved in that police 
station.  They  come in and to ld us this. 
This was the final ausweisung, and ev erybody st
arted looking where to 
get away.  At that 
time my  father was already taken away, and he 
sent to treblinkA:  I didn't  know where he 
was sent.  We just know th ey took him away
.  When they took him 
away we were told 
he's in a working camp, he might stay in 
a working camp for a while, but we had no 
contact.  There was no something you canwrite a letter to each other, whatever. 
Q: You thought he would come back. Right? 

A: Yes.  And my  tw o brothers 
was close enough, six miles away. 
Q: Right. 
A: So th ey was work ing on that station.  By
 that time, before th
e ausweisung come up, 
they come in and took them and took us, me, a
nd send us to skarzysko.  Sk arzysko is a 
city.  We had camps there, but not dead
 camp s, working camps.  They  was making 
ammunition for the army .  And we last over there a short while. And i tell you the story 
how we come out from there, but that's -- it'
s confusing because i don't follow up.  Wh en  
that happened, that contact to
ld us what's going to happen, my  husband co me into the 
railroad.  And i was wo rking, an d we was not ma
rried yet, and he told me so and so  going 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
26 
to happen  and th ey're going to
 send everybody away
 to some kind of camps where we'r e 
not going to see each other.  We didn
't  know dead camps.  We know camps. 
Q: Right. 
A: He says, but i was told the young co uple s have a chance.  The older couples will go 
there, but young singles, they're separated.
  You don't know wher
e you are.  Young 
couples have a chance because 
they need workers, healthy wo
rkers.  If we get married we 
have a better chance to survive and we could 
vouch for each other.  I said, it's  not a bad 
idea, but it's not the time to get married, and my  father is not here any longer.  I don't 
even know where he is.  My brothers are here
.  Who is going to marry us?  What kind of 
marriage you expect?  He said, who cares? 
 It's not a time to worry about anything 
extreme Œ 
Q: Had you known him?  

A: -- but just to be together.  Oh, we know each other for years. 

Q: Yeah?  Were you in  school together? 
A: Yes.  Yeah.  No.  He was older. He wa
s seven years older than i was.  He was 
watching me since i was a little girl, since i 
was going to public sc
hool, high school and 
every place else.  We was very
 close friend as he's older, young man.  And i was too 
young, so we just flir
t but noth ing serious.  
Q: What did he do? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
27 
A: The head of textile busine
ss. They were very wealthy pe
ople, had a big operation in 
that city.  And, of course, it happened to 
them, the same things. 
 They come in and 
cleaned up all of their houses 
and their retail store and ev erything else. Again, like i say, 
that was the last things ever
ybody wo rried, we had less clothe
s or we'll have less food, as 
long as they leave us alone
, because for some reason ot
her -- we didn't experience 
anything like this.  And we was young, 19 year
s.  I had friend for 19 years, and i know 
she wouldn't dream what i do in a time like this
.  I was smarter then than she smart now.  
Like the whole thing is not clicking, 
because i'm going from one to another. 
Q: That's o k ay. 
A: I'm telling you a story. 

Q: That's o k ay.  I 
wanted to know Œ  
A: It's just like sometimes you read  
a book and it just doesn't follow up.  
Q: No.  It's actually -- i mean
, i'm hearing it for the first ti
me, so it makes sense to me. I 
wanted to  ask you ab out the two years that
 you lived  in a small quarters with seven 
people.  That was 
you and your mo ther? 
A: Me, my mother, my father
 and the two brothers, my  tw
o brothers and my  mo ther's 
sister and aunt. 
Q: Okay . 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
28 
A: Because they all lived in that -- we had 
a very, very big house 
of two blocks, and it's 
not just ours.  It was left by a grandfather in
 the old country that, when they was building 
something, our family struct
ure was built like a castle for 
the whole family.  And there 
was my mother 's sist er s, brothers, uncles. 
 Everybody has his ow
n quarters, like five 
rooms, seven rooms, whatever the size of the fa
mily. And they took a
ll of this away.  My 
aunt was a widow. Sh e was 83.  And sh e has a sister.  She was not married.  She was 
married and lost her husband.  So we all shared
 this two rooms, all seven of us.  But that 
was not the worst.  We shared so
mething else, too, in our life. 
Q: So th at was two years? 
A: Two years, yes, yes, we lived there.  
And then, when  the ausweisung co me out, there 
was like -- no.  We got ma
rried.  I'm going back. 
Q: Oh, so you did get -- okay.  
You got married, you said, yes. 
A: We come back to the city.  It w as like, 
like i'm saying, six, seven miles away from the 
railroad.  We come back to the city and th
ere was Œ we found -- a few of our friends our 
age was with us in that group
 of young people, and we disc
ussed this with them.  And 
they decided, yes, it's a good idea.  Four coupl
es of us went to a specific place w h ere they 
have services in the evenin
g for somebody to marry us, because we didn't have the 
parents to do anything for us
, and there has to be somebo
dy to  give us some kind of 
authority to be married. 
Q: Sure. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
29 
A: When we at that place there was not too 
many jewish people that
 have that authority. 
The only one that has authority, if you had to ru
le it, it co uld be a ra
bbi, if you understand 
what this is. There was -- one of those jews wa
s one of my  uncles. He was in the group of 
ten, and he married all 
four of us, the four couples.  Of
 course, from the four couples i'm 
the only one alive. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yes.  They all went.  And after we was 
ma rried we was called one good day.  They  
come in -- the night before we heard in the 
city it's going to happen  tomo rrow, next day 
or whatever.  And everybody -- we didn't hide 
because there was no place to hide.  And if 
to hide we have to be prepared. So mebody
 has to give us some kind of places or 
whatever. 
Q: Sure. 
A: At 7:00 in the mo rning Œ th
e night before we heard ab out.
  We were told it's going 
direct for a week or so.  Seven, eight o'cl
ock in the mo rning th ey knocked on th e door.  
And my  grandfather was living in  the same ho
use, also, and his wife.  He was 83 or 84, 
also, in age.  They knocked 
on his door. They come out.  And she didn't see.  She was 
elderly age and she didn't see, blind.  Sh
e was holding his arm because she didn't see 
where she was walking.  They're screaming,
 yelling, get out, get out, get out.  And she 
hold him by his arm, not even dressed, and on
e of the gestapos knoc
ked her over her head 
with a -- it was some kind of -- was it a gun or
 was it some kind of instrument.  It was 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
30 
pretty serious.  She fall on the floor.  
And he grabbed him, the old man was 
(indecipherable) because all 
the people shame, and throw them -- outside was a truck 
sitting right by the street, and on the truck.  
How long he last, it's 
-- just god knows.  
Could be an hour, could be Œ 
who knows, but they killed hi
m or die.  Anyway, he was 
going.  And then th ey're going 
from house to house.  Of course, they  come to us.  We got 
up, woke up, and they took us
 on -- the older people went 
right away on trucks.  The 
younger people, they took us
 on plots, like they call the 
plaza, a spacious place where 
they can put every
body out and say left, right, left,  right
, left, right.  We didn't  know who 
was the left, who was the right, but one went to camp , one went to Au schwitz or any 
other. I call in to look, call in to the what
ever, the cnp (phonetic).  Me and my husband 
were safe, but we know it's  
not going to help in a few we
eks or months, whatever, after 
we work.  Our health will co
me down and we'r e not going to
 be capable to go on with 
whatever, or whatever.  Who can predict? 
 We started looking fo r a way -- everything -- 
we had times like, you know, a second, a mi
nute, a minute and a second.  That's  not 
anymore.  I had a friend, a non-jewish friend.  He was also in the 
polish army as a main 
person, an  army  man, and he 
was working in the 
underg round in the polish army .  What 
was his reason, i don't know.  He was trying to
 save us.  He came to me before and he 
asked me, if time gets so seri
ous you want me to find a savi
ng place, before i got married, 
a place where to hide you. 
Q: Oh. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
31 
A: And at that time i was not serious enough
 to say yes or no, bu
t when it happened i 
contacted and i says, you rememb er what you told
 me? He says, okay.  It's still open.  We 
take you in a farm, he and a teacher at school. 
 And on that farm -- i already talked to the 
farmer, he said, because i talked to him at
 the time when i approa
ched you, and he's  
willing to do this for so
 much a mont
h, money. 
Q: He was willing to do it for money?  
A: Oh, sure.  What do you 
think? For A Fee.  (Tape We
nt Quiet For A Moment.)  
Anyhow, I believe -- there was some other things
 left, what could be exchanged.  And, of 
course, nobody know 
how long this will last.  We 
was hoping maybe three months, 
maybe six months.  And nobody pr
edicted a five-year history, bu
t the point is 
they picked 
us up.  Well, i -- it's th e whole story -- in sk
arzysko.  My brothers was in skarzysko and i 
-- no.  After this we went to skarzysko.  I 
really don't -- i'm confused with the marriage 
busin ess. 
Q: That's o k ay.  Wait, wait, wait. When
 you got married, that was in forty Œ 
A: In '42. 

Q: In '42? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you had lived  from 194 Œ 

A: September 20, 1942.  I remember. 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
32 
Q: September 20th, 1942.  And so  you -- betwee
n '40 and '42 is when you lived with your 
family in the very close quarters? 
A: Yes.  We didn't live there.  We ju
st come back to sleep or whatev er. 
Q: You were there while you were work ing on the railroad? 

A: We was work ing Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: -- yes, back and fo rth. 

Q: And then you talk
ed to him in '42? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And you got married with th e four Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- by your uncle?  And Œ 
A: I -- we was transferred to sk
arzysko after this, all of us, th
e group that was         
married and not married, but we contact him that
 we need a hiding place.  The situation is 
like this. 
Q: How did you contact him?  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
33 
A: How?  There was visiting.  There was st
ill people coming to the -- there was workers 
to Jews and non-Jews. 
Q: At the Œ 
A: It was not just Jews, because Jews was th
e slavery, and the non-Jews was the one that 
supervised. 
Q: I see. 
A: They watched over us.  It's not -- th
e germans couldn't spread around the army  
between such a nonsense, working on the railroad,
 working on the city. 
 So they used the 
polish people, the one that assigned it, like i said
, a half-german or         even a polish 
policeman or whatever.  And wh
en we come -- we had contac
t.  I know we know quite a 
lot of people.  We lived in that city for l
ong time, and my husband had a wealthy family, 
another business.  And if you 
do business with people, they
 like you enough, there's still 
some kind of connection. My
 brother approached, wh en we was in skarzysko, the 
youngest one, 15 years old, approached on
e of those (indecipherable), or whatever he 
was, gestapo or somebody, that he give him a
ll his clothes. He was just in boots and -- it 
was already in the fall, and a jacket and ev
erything, because he ha
d gold pieces in the 
boots, hide it away.  We all put some jewelry 
in places that we can dispose it and be able 
to get out some bread money fo r.  And he 
said, i give you my  boots, i give you my  
clothes, and give me a unifo rm and take me to the st
ation.  And that man fall fo
r it.  He         
opened the boot and he 
found out it's gold pieces.  He fa
ll for it.  He 
could have killed 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
34 
him, but it's  god's will for him not to kill hi
m, because he could ha
ve all the things and 
kill him and forg et about it. He took all of t
hose things and took him, took us, all three of 
us to the station, to railroad station.  And we
 all arrived in that c
ity where we supposed to 
go to  hiding.  And that man was waiting for us 
on the station and pick
ed us up in a wagon 
of hay.  We all crawled  in and went to that 
place with that farmer.  We dig a hole in the 
barn.  You know, they had thos
e barns for cattle, for pigs or  whatever.  We dig a hole in 
the barn six foot deep , ten foot square a
nd covered this up in board s and covered the 
boards with hay and straw, with whatever, just
 pretend it's a part of the barn.  And little 

by little that gentleman, the gentile, brought in
 my mother.  My mo
ther was in hiding, 
because he hide.  
Q: Oh.  I see. 

A: And brought in my  husband and my  husb
and's sister.  So it was a total of six. 
Q: Okay .  So  then you and Œ 

A: My mother Œ 

Q: -- your mother, your husband? 

A: -- my  husband and two brothers. 

Q: The two brothers.  Okay . 

A: And my husband's sister. 

Q: Four of you -- or the six of you in this hole? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
35 
A: In that hole.  That was not th
e end of it.  We even brought in
 my sister's two         
children, but we lost them in a short time.  
T h ey were just there a 
few months, couple of 
months, but tried to save them.  Didn't succee d.  They were too young and they  went out 
for things and they got killed. 
 One was nine, one was eleven.  But we was trying in that.  
We didn't sleep laying flat but 
sit.  Everybody would sit in th
eir clothes, whatever clothes 
we still had.  We stayed in that bunker for months. 
Q: How did you eat? 
A: It was very difficult.  She bought -- it was very
 difficult with food, because
 if         the 
lady, the farmer lady was in a good mood, sh
e cooked.  She brought down  potatoes and 
baked a bread. This was good en ough.  As long 
as we had potatoes, we had bread, we had 
water, we can live, but if someth
ing just didn't  work  very we
ll in her household, we could 
sit two and three days without 
food, without anything. The only
 ad vantage we had, in th e 
middle of the night we went up and we coul
d pull out from the barn
 Œ they have those 
spaces for the animals where 
they're throwing potatoes, 
cooked potatoes for Œ  
Q: Oh, a trough.  Trough.  Right? 
A: And from this, the leftovers, we took it down,
 and that was the -- and if we needed to 
drink water something was available outside.  
We had to  go down  -- a
nd this was for -- to 
clean us, to wash up, too, beca
use in daytime we didn't  have 
that opportunity .  So we had 
to wait till midnight and when everyb
ody on the farm w as quiet, asleep
, we went out         
one at a time and washed ourself, cleaned up to
 a point.  I don't want to even rememb er 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
36 
how. Of course, we got sick.  I had all type
 of sickness, and my mother was sic k .  We 
didn't  even think we would surv ive.  There 
was -- there was not even
 -- we didn't care, 
frankly.  I personally Œ I cannot speak for ever
ybody.  I personally didn't care. I was just 
doing a favor for the rest of th
em I'm with. That's my opin
ion.  But my  opinion was big 
deal, who needs that kind of life, being a pr
incess, having everythi
ng in home and being 
dressed and being popular and being somebo
dy.  And no time nobody even  cares. All my  
friends, they don 't even want to talk to me. I'
m just like a disease.  
So who cares to live in 
a time like this.  It's 
even embarrassing.  You can be themost beautiful child, but you still 
a child.  You think like a child.  The fact is, 
my self, I didn't know what
's commit suicide.  
I didn't know wh at you do not to live, but i didn'
t care.  I say, whatever happens to me, if 
they take me out, they kill me
, so they kill me. I didn't know
 how the feeling of killing, 
but just listening to it I agreed to be the vic
tim. And what can I say?  Time went by. After 
quite some time the man was 
getting wealthier and wealth ier, the farmer, by paying him 
so much money each month.  
Q: Who paid him? 

A: The outsider, the gentleman outside, what find us the place, give him an ultimatum.  

Q: So your friend, the one that Œ 
A: Yes, my friend.  He told him before he 
board us in, he said, lis
ten, i know a lot of 
farmers taking this and after a few months they
 get tired of it, they kill and take away 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
37 
everything they have.  They  have nothing.  
Everything they have I have, and I'm the 
witness.  If anything ha
ppens to them same th
ing will happen to you. 
Q: He said that to the farmer?  
A: Yes.  And on those agreemen
t he took us in.  So we had 
some security.  We know as 
long as he is not going to be tired of us 
we will live, unless we die from diseases or 
whatever.  
Q: Diseases. 
A: And, of course, they  used to  come on th
e farm for food, the Gestapo.  The German 
army used to come every farmer, take out a pi
g, a cow, poultry, eggs, whatever.  This was 
common.  Every time they come
 in, three, four of them 
with a truck, they was going 
around with their rifles and digging,
 trying to in the ground to see 
if it's soft.  If it's soft, 
somebody is hiding.  And th e minute they come 
in they asking, have you this here, or do 
you have Jews?  They  say no, 
but that was already common th at a lot of people in hiding. 
Q: Sure. 

A: One Sunday he comes home and he says he
 wants to talk to us.  He knocks on th e 
things. He even -- what is it? 
 His name was Wadick (phonetic). What is it?  He said, we 
heard in church stories that the rumors go ar
ound on the farm that we have Jews. And i 
asked him, i says, what makes you think it's 
serious?  He said, because i told them I'm 
going to  build a house.  They  say, how can yo
u build a house if you 
don't have Jews there 
to pay you for it?  Because 
farmers were poor people.  Th
ey had a little house, you know, 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
38 
from straw, whatever.  He said he's going to
 build a brick house, and he's bragging ab out 
it, and his wife is going to the city buying be
tter clothes than she used  to wear.  Naturally, 
things like this give you some 
suspicion.  So  we decided if 
that's -- and that was already 
in '44.  
Q: '44? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Wow. 
A: We decided if that's  going Œ if he already told us this, it's not going to take very long, 
or he himself can call the police Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and tell them, I h ave Jews here not by w
ill.  They just come in
 and they hide and I 
discovered that they are there, or tell them 
they come in to rob me, or anything.  You 
know, what Œ to rob even pota
toes is a robbery, you know.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: So we decide it's not goin
g to work, we have to see -- to
 find another place.  And my  
man -- I say man. 
Q: Your friend? 

A: Yes.  He come out, because he used to come out Œ 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
39 
Q: And visit? 
A: -- every once in a while and talk to us.  An
d he picked days, because he was in the city 
and knows what days in the week  the Gestapo 
comes in. Not every day 
they were there.  
The army was there, but the -- 
you know, the one in the black 
uniforms.  They just come 
in for visits, like stake everything out fo r ev
erybody or killing somebody.  So  he chose 
those days what's safer for him to visit us.  
And we told him the story, it's not going to  
work .  And he said, okay.  I have another pl
ace for you.  The guy'
s a very poor farmer, 
but i told  him i expect one day it's going to  
happen.  He was a very smart businessman.  
He was in busin ess.  They  had a lot of farms,
 but he himself had -- was in the automobile 
busin ess.  Like the bosses we ha
ve going back and forth, he 
had th ose bosses, that man.  
He was with people.  He was not just a pers
on th at don't understand life.  He could see 
what is going on and he was, like they say, 
a patriot in polish. They say he was a real 

patriot.  He believed that one of those days 
we get rid of the Germans and Po land is going 
to be Poland like it used to be.  And to him 
it was a challenge that 
he had the opportunity 
to save lives, Jews or non-Jews or somebody.
  That's my  opinion, 
because why would he 
-- he didn't get any money.  We just reward hi
m a gift later, but he had no benefit as far as 
financial.  Everything what we 
left with him he used for Œ 
Q: For you? 
A: -- for that purpose.  As a matter of fact, he
 was short when  he took us over to the other 
farmer.  He told him, i don't have any mo re 
money to  pay you, but th
ey have pretty nice 
homes from both sides of the family.  If they 
survive you will have 
something.  If they 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
40 
don't survive i will see to
 it that you get all the things that
 belongs to them.  So the farmer 
fall for this, too.  You know, after 
all, smart        or not, they
 took a chance.  Frankly, they 
took a chance -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- For their life, too.  Not 
as we had having there, but th
e same token, they  didn't have 
to do this either.  A lot of 
people didn't want to do this. 
Q: Yes.  Yeah. 
A: He come back and told us 
that he made the arrangement w
ith other guy, but it's a good 
walking distance.  It was quite a few miles, 
four, seven, eight miles.  And i rememb er it 
was farm, farm, farms. 
Monday we have in our city like 
exchange food, like a market.  
The farmers come with food, 
with everything to the city
, exchange for clothes, for 
equipment to wo rk on th
e farm for appliances, for stuff like this.  
End of File One 
Beginning of File Two 
Q: Okay . 
A: We decided that night it's  going to be the 
best night to walk out 
from this place and go 
to the other place.  
Q: You had to walk? 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
41 
A: We (indecipherable) who is going to take 
us.  We dressed as women and men, and th e 
women in those little babushkas, what the farm
ers wear, and baskets 
of eggs.  Everybody 
has a basket and three eggs, whateve
r.  If they catch us or something -- 
Q: You have -- 
A: -- the language we know.  Germany, I co
uld speak German to them.  Polish, I can 
speak Polish to them.  Where 
they're going, cover my face to see whether I'm a Jew or 
not, everything I have to just answer.  So 
we walked by and, of 
course, it's alw ays a 
(indecipherable), always somebody watches the 
-- where they had stations, like a station 
of so many soldiers or some
body, certain places.  We ha
d to by walk by so mething like 
this.  Regardless of which part of the city we
 will go, it was all four corners, and we walk 
by and he come out and he stop.  Okay . 
 Where you going?  A German, this was a 
German, and I says we going back 
to the farm.  What do you ha
ve?  Eggs.  I was afraid if 
he come close to me, I cannot lie.  He said go
.  I couldn't  eat your eggs.  You know, if I 
would say kielbasa or vodka or someth
ing else, he probab ly would stop me. 
Q: And take it or something? 

A: But eggs, go.  They had plenty eggs. 

Q: (Indecipherable). 
A: Back to the place, and we 
did the same thing.  We did 
the same thing, and we moved 
in in that place, and that was in '4 4.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
42 
Q: (Inaudible).  
A: Yes, and we stayed there.  Didn't have 
any contact with nobody.  Was very primitive, 
old people, farmers.  N o  news
papers, no radios, no anything.  We couldn't  send them to 
the city to buy papers because
 be suspicious.  Farmers k n ow
 who is ignorant and who is 
not educated.  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: We lived the kind of life we possibly coul
d live, very boring, very uncomfortable, 
short of money.  My  brother went out to a near
 farm where he left all of his clothes, all 
his necessary things at a friend of his.  Since 
we so short, he was hoping wh en he surviv e, 
he needs the clothes.  Didn't bother taking aw
ay from him, but since we were so short and 
the farmer really didn't have enough money 
to buy even  for the cattle's  food, so we felt 
for him. So my  brother on a Satu rday night he 
went out to that other farmer, and he said I 
have couple of suits for you. I have to take 
him and sell it.  He said I buy them from you. 
He said okay.  Well, whatever you want to pa
y me for it.  He said 30 dollars.  He said 
fine, 30 dollars, and visit with 
a friend of his for a while and 
walked back to us.  Walking 
back a few, maybe a mile or whatever from 
there, he followed him. Took away the 30 
dollars and kill him. 
Q: Oh.  
A: We see one day he's not th
ere; the next day he's  not th
ere. We told he was visiting 
those people that were friends.  One good da
y the farmer come down and he said in the 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
43 
city they say they killed an
other Jew because ev
ery day you co
uld hear, and my mother 
immediately for some reason she 
felt like that's the one.  She 
said -- she said to him you 
know who they killed? No, a you
ng man.  She send him back to the city and says find out 
what kind of clothes he wear or somebody go
ing to tie us up and he
 come back and he 
said he wear a jacket.  Describe the jacket.  
That's when we know it
's my  older brother.  
Q: Who was it; was it his friend that
 bought the -- was i t his friend? 
A: Yes.  For 30 dollars they killed a person. 
 That's  the way -- that's the kind of time we 
lived.  
Q: Yeah.  
A: And a lot of cases, frankly,
 I take -- the Polish people was as guilty as the Germans.  
They  did mo re harm to the Polish Jews as th
e Germans.  Germans took us to work, put us 
in the crematorium because that
 was the Fuhrer wanted them 
to do and they
 claim they 
had to believe in his philosophy and his -- th
at (indecipherable) people.  Even got paid 
them for it, and time changed 
but still they had their own e
xplanation and they come to 
judgment, but the Poles didn't have any intere
st whatsoever to do 
anything like that.  
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: Because after all their country  was already occupied  by th e Germans, and the 
Germans should be to them so
me body not a friend but the enemy.  Why help  an enemy?  
They  didn't (indecipherable) to help the enemy.
  They done it for a 
lousy $30, but that's 
another story because ev
erything -- if we go back in hist
ory and people are not ignorant, 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
44 
we know.  We're all human.  We all have so
me kind of evil time of life. That's  what 
happened.  So we lost one. 
 That was already Ap ril 15, 1944.  We continued with a 
shortage, and January Russia -- the Russians st
art comin g  in to -- what you call it -- in 
'45, January '45.  We heard the planes crui
sing around those farms 
and those little cities.  
We was wondering being 
underground, what were planes 
doing on th e farm?  We know 
that the Germans have no reason now.  They 
(indecipherable).  They  have no reason to be 
in that part of the country.  If we -- we kn
ow the map, we know wh
at part of the world 
they should be now and knowing they was fight
ing with Russia, they
 should be far, far 
away from that part we be in, but who can 
tell?  We had no news
paper, no radio.  How 
can we even say?  We estimate or we heard 
anything that 's going on, people on the farm 
talk, and they say -- and he said, yes, 
the planes was going through Warsaw, was 
throwing bombs and they say th e Germans are losing the war.  
Okay.  That's g o od news.  

But how soon or wh at? One good day he's knoc
king on our thing.  He said, folks, you 
free.  You can come out.  My husband says 
huh-uh, the Russians, we
 not coming out.  
We thought they want to do 
something to us.  He said th
e Russians are here.  So we 
opened a little bit, and we said Russians (inde
cipherable)  why you 
have that news, and 
he said the Russians are new city. Everybody 
under fire is hiding because we don't know 
what they 'r e going to do to  us, but if you're Je
ws, you can go back  to the city, and we said 
if you're hiding, why would th ey
 be so good to us; we hiding
 with you.  Because another 
day we got out from the bunker.  
We had no clothes.  It wa
s wintertime. It was the 17th 
of January .  We had no clothes, able to walk 
on such -- and winter in
 Poland is very cold 
in this time of year and the ice on the 
ground.  We have no shoes.  Everything 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
45 
deteriorated in five years, what we have.  So
 the lady, the old lady, she was so poor, give 
us blankets from the horses, torn, in rags, 
you know, something not 
worth even saving fo r 
a rag, but it's still some thing you cover yourse
lf up, and we walk ba
ck to the city.  We 
come back to the city
.  Everybody was in tu
rmoil because everybody was again afraid of 
the Russian.  We still not free.  We are st
ill under some kind of -- we settled in a house 
because everybody Œ everything
 was occupied by not owne
rs, but Germans supply the 
houses for whoever worked for them, whoeve
r did something for the German army or 
whatever.  So we couldn't get in
 our house.  A postman was living th ere.  So we went to 
my  sister-in-law's house.  We mo ved in.  An
other couple come in a day later, a single 
man come in, grouped together.  There was -- th
at particular city had 3,000 Jews.  By the 
time they all got in in th
e city, we have 17 alive. 
Q: 17 from the 3,000? 
A: From the 3,000 th at was hiding in bunkers 
and camps or wh atever.  We grouped all 17 
in the same area.  Was 
afraid to separate.  
Q: Did you know th em all?  

A: Yes.  Small city.  We lived
 there for a while.  As a matter of fact, I went to my -- I was 
a very close friend of the mayor's sister.  
She was my age.  Mayor over there was the 
burgomeister, if you know wh at that means.  
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: We lived across -- I told you we
 live in a good 
neighborhood.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
46 
Q: Yeah.  
A: Across from us we have an architect, a dr
ugsto re, and his wife's  sister was my  best 
friend.  So I left her all my clothes, all my
 goodies, whatever.  When I come back, I have 
no (indecipherable) because just (indecipherable).  I will stop and she would give me 
back my  clothes.  I went in and I thought 
she was passed out seeing me.  I didn't know.  
Is the reaso n  because she felt 
sorry for me the way I look or is it the reason -- I didn 't 
know why.  So I start -- I was waiting for 
a good an swer.  She said, you know something, 
I wouldn't want you to be here.  I said I don 't 
intend to be here.  I just like for you to give 
me some of my clothes or some shoes, someth
ing so I can start gettin g dressed.  She said 
I'm sorry to tell you there's no clothes left, not
hing.  Your jewelry, your clothes, your 
coat, everything the police took out from my  ho
use.  I said you su re you have nothing 
left, and if she would be really a sincere pe
rson, she could have gi
ven me something from 
her clothes --  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: -- if it's  true, but that 's okay.  That's wh
at I'm trying to tell you.  And I said how did the 
police know to take my  clothes.  She sa
id you know you was too popular, everybody 
know wh at kind of clothes you wear.  When 
they come in, 
they know.  The jealousy was 
so extreme.  Know what you wear.  I said 
what can you give me?  I cannot give you 
nothing.  I want you to leave.  I said can 
you give me some potatoes.  We are really 
hungry.  She gave me a couple of potatoes.  
That was my best friend.
 Okay.  So no reason 
for me to worry and stay in th
at city or do an ything.  I said
 to my husb and, we have to 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
47 
move. We have too many friends here from the 
past but they wouldn't want us.  They  
don't want us period.  First they are occupy
ing our homes.  They 
have our goods.  We 
stuffed up so many different friends w
ith goodies and goodies and goodies, and 
everybody was afraid we want everything back 
or want some back or whatever.  So I said 
it's no place for us.  Let's go someplace else.  I was -- even I was young, I was always 
capable to do so mething.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I could sew, I could write, I 
could read.  I could do anythi
ng I want to do.  We pack, 
and I stopped a Russian truck an d they took us 
to a different city, me and my husband.  I 
settled in that city.  I k n ow that city from be
fore, Szczecin I went to that city.  I start 

peddling around.  I see clothes 
is good there.  This is th
ree miles aw ay from the German 
border.  We could walk over 
from one place to another.  It was open already.  There was 
no -- because there was always Germany and 
Poland had a border and (u ndecipherable) 
where we could go back and 
forth and not worry about (inde
cipherable) or whatever.  I 
bought some clothes I exchanged for food.  
I went down to Un ion Station and I bought 
food from the farmers in
 exchange for clothes.  The pe
ople, they need food because the 
big city had a very good shortage of everything, and went one to another, I make my self a 

little money.  I opened a store, a g rocery st
ore.  I don't k n ow too much ab out grocery 
stores but who cannot
 sell groceries.  
Q: Yeah, uh-huh.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
48 
A: What is it, it's  food.  I worked  in that 
store for a while, and I was very unhappy.  My  
mother and my brother is still 
in that city, but my brother was a very capable person, for 
you have a fact already that he took us ou
t from camp by age 15 and now he's ag e almost 
20.  So  I was not comfortable and I worried 
ab out not contact him constantly  because I 
want him to move away from that city.  He
 said he's doing well financially.  He was a 
good mechanic too.  At 15 years already drov
e a car.  He is fixing bicycles, cars, sewing 
machines, and he's selling th em. 
 Buys an old one, broken one, 
fixes it and sells it.  So he 
was doing pretty good for a while.  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: But fo r me being so restless, not having 
him close to me since 
I have nobody, I lost 
everybody and that's the only th
ing I have is my  mo ther and 
my  brother.  That's  the whole 
family from 96 people.  It was 
a family of 96.  He decided 
he's going to move, find him a 
place there and, as a matter of fact, he come 
to see the place and he
 supposed to move on 
a certain date.  He came to see the place.  He
 bought a lot of stuff to take home with him 
from (indecipherable).  When 
he brought everything home, 
it was May 1, 1945 -- 1945, 
yes.  It was already four months after lib
eration.  Coming home with a truck with 
goodies, going into  his house.  The (indeci
pherable) stopped him and 
killed him.  It was 
four months after.  He was 20 years old.  So I lost another one. I went back to  that city, 
packed my mother, and I took
 her with me to Szczecin a
nd decided there's no room for 
us, not in Szczecin, not in (indecipherable).  
We have to go some places.  We have to 
forget about that country, forget ab out that part
 of the world.  There was choices.  It was 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
49 
two choices.  Can go with a visa to Un ited States
 or to Israel. Israel was not yet a country.  
It was '45.  But they accepted pe
ople, took a long time, like y
ou have to have
 -- you have 
to register.  
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: And who is coming from, takes a year, two,
 three, whatever, but it's a question when  
you get your visa.  Our visa came  in in 1958.
  No.  Pardon me.  
But in the meantime, I 
have to move away from Poland.  This is num
ber one.  We packed again what we have.  
We moved to Germany.  

Q: You moved to Germany?  
A: We mo ved.  We took our route.  Wherev
er we going to get st
opped or hold back, we 
stay.  We was traveling.  We was in (indecip
herable), we was in Linz, we was in cities, 
all to drove, until we finally come across in
 Linz some people from a neighbor city we 
know, and th ey say th ey are going to Regens
burg.  Who is in Regensburg?  We don't 
know.  We heard it's a city.  Let's go.  
We went.  The whole gr
oup from the camp over 
there in Linz went to Regensburg.  We went
.  We settled in Regens
burg.  This was '45 
settled.  Such a fast transaction.  
Q: Yeah.  How did you get there; by train?  
A: By halting th e Russians truc
ks, stop and take me, three mile
s, six miles, twenty miles, 
whatever.  Rest of it, if we have to walk, we
 walk.  We walked thro
ugh forests because it 
was (indecipherable).  It was (indecipherable)
.  In some places you couldn't pass through 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
50 
without the passport.  Where you going, who ar
e you?  That's  a very uncomfortable time, 
one co untry take over the other one and don't trust anybody. Could 
be espionag e, could 
be anything.  The fact is that we went th
rough -- we walked and whatever, however we 
smuggled out through.  We arrived in Rege
nsburg, and Regensburg was organization.  
There was help.  Su rvivors already established. 
They give us temporary.  We're always in 
one place, but food was available, clothes 
was available.  It 
was an organization. 
You go in and you can find a dr
ess, a dress, old, new, what
ever, just something to cover 
your body, and so we had the 
-- like they have here, those st
amps.  We had th ose kind of 
stamps to go and get -- we get cheese and 
we get milk, and you 
get whatever, and we 
lived among the (indecipherable)
 and then we got a little apar
tment for us, for me and my 
husband.  My mo ther was not with  me yet.  Th
e two of us went beca
use we didn't know.  
We couldn't drag an older pe
rson with us. Wherever we wo
uld go finally if we have a 
destination we stay, then I go pick  up my  mo
ther.  I did so after three months being in 
Regensburg.  I went back.  I didn't have en
ough money to travel like a human being by 
train.  Went back to Szczecin, picked up 
my  mo ther and brother to Regensburg.  We 
stayed.  We all applied for United States beca
use my  husband had an  uncle in New Yo rk.  
We was hoping thro ugh him our visa would co
me a lot faster but sounds like he was too 
old to sp onsor three people.  So  we had to 
wait for the federation, UJA, whatever you call 

it now, for them to help us in that respect, but they abso lutely did, last quite some time.  

In the meantime, since we was 
in Regensburg and waiting, we 
had to do something.  We 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
51 
opened a business.  We begin -- 
we worked different things. 
 I was doing a lot of sewing, 
a lot of everything.  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: And trying to  make dollars 
and cents, and my  husband was 
trying to buy whatever he 
possibly could.  We had good co
nnection.  We have languages in that respect.  We went 
to old factories for the old sew purses, wh
atever was not saleable and was not -- and 
brought into  the city, and th en we got -- we 
was -- got the opportunity from the city to get 
the stamps.  When you need clothes, you ne
ed stamps.  You need  shoes, you need 
stamps.  There was no such thing in  thos
e years you can buy direct for money.  
Everything in the city is assigned to you.  We
 got the opportunity.  
We ran the store. We 
did that type of -- my  husband was pretty capa
ble, and I had the languages, and I didn't 
worry about whether write
, read or whatever.  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: Was not like some survivors 
at that time who couldn't help 
themselves as far as -- not 
that I was so knowledgeable, but I was good 
enough to  do all those things, and th rough 
this, we had a store.  We make good money.
  We was pretty good off in no time.  We 
have everything, but human being expect and my  son was born in  Regensburg .  Of 
course, 1950 we give everything.  I had a part
ner to that busin ess.  We took in also a 
Jewish man, a German, from our state, fro
m H anover.  He was from Hanover.  She was 
from Prague, the wife.  We took 
them in as partners, so we le
ft them the busin ess, and we 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
52 
walked out with just 
wh at money we had.  We moved to
 Kansas City.  We was assigned 
to Kansas --  
Q: I see.  
A: -- according to the visa.  We didn't pick Ka
nsas City.  We didn't  know what Kansas 
City is.  We want actually go to New York but  didn't  get the privilege of going to New 
York because they say a lot of people 
settling those years in New York like it's 
overdoing.  So they  send us to Kansas C
ity, and very nice lady from the UJA was waiting 
for us and picked us up in a car.  We wa
s people back  to life.  Somehow nothing is 
forever, not the good, not the bad.  We have
 a good (indecipherable) who always watches 
us.  It's not true.  Some people feel like wh
y God let this happen if it's really such an 
unjustice. Sometime even a good
 father spank their child.  
If you don't live the right way, 
you have obligations to deliver wh at -- what
 your religion tells you,
 and you go against, 
you lose those opportunities.  Somehow the 
same thingis happeni
ng now. If we don't 
watch out and we don't look because we all eq
ual. We don't worry about one is black and 
one is blue, one has more 
money and one has less money.
  We should all be equal 
because we all gots children.  I 
raised my children this way, 
and I hope they will continue 
to be what they are now and th
at they be some kind of bene
fit to the world because they 
are good children and they believe what I belie
ve.  Prejudice is not going to  bring us no 
place.  Whether it's Jewish or 
it's another religion or whatev
er it is, if we're not going to 
teach the children and bring them to a point
 to understand, don't think a Jew have 
(indecipherable) or don't think a black is dirt
y and filthy or wh atever.  You give them the 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
53 
opportunity, he can wash himself as well as 
you can do.  He can be as good as anybody 
else.  You don't have to be pure 
wh ite to be the best person.  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: You can be anything and be a good person
.  Just think of what the world -- why you'r e 
here, why -- we all gots children.  We all here 
for a purpose.  So let's 
think about it.  Let's 
do th e right things.  
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: That's w h at I can tell you about my life.  

Q: Do you still have contact w
ith the people who hid you?  
A: I had contact until two years ago.  He 
passed away.  The wife
 is still alive.  
Q: Is that the farmer or the friend?  

A: No.  I never had contact with the farmer.  
Q: With the farmer.  Ju st with
 the friend who helped you?  
A: That's right.  I would send him money fr
om Germany when I lived in Germany.  I 
would send him money from the United States. 
 Whoever went to visit Poland, I send 
money with them.  
Q: Uh-huh.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
54 
A: My cousin from Canada went
 and I sent with him.  He 
send me beautiful pictures of 
him and his wife and ch ildren, and he wrote me
 letters.  We was in contact constantly, 
constantly. In the beginning it was difficult to
 send money.  So I sent packages from 
Chicago from (indecipherable) --  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: -- at the time for Christmas 
half a dozen packages
 that (indecipherable) and clothes.  I 
was buying those coupons they  would se
ll for a suit, three yards of coupons 
(indecipherable) so and so much. 
 I always send three or four coupons.  He sold them and 
make some  money.  
Q: Yeah.  
A: And whatever was available, every connec
tion I had to send them something, I sent 
them.  One time a nephew of ours was there 
to visit him, and he said (speakin g in a 
foreign language).  Because I told him, I says 
I want you to leave him the money.  That's 
the reason I send it, and he left it he said to
 him.  (Speaking a foreign language).  Of 
course, he was the angel of life.  Let's face it.  
Q: Sure, sure.  

A: That could be both ways or God send them --  

Q: Uh-huh.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
55 
A: -- or it was just he so righteous to achie
ve something like this.  That's a good question 
because he's the heaven.  I 
know.  He have to be born
 for something like this.  
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: What else can I tell you (tape goes quiet) 
because there's a back story, there's a front 
story, and what's going on. Certain things that
 come to me after I walk out from here --  
Q: Right, right.  
A: -- because it's just -- lik
e I remember a sto ry, we was like girls and we had the -- the 
Typhus start in the city, and th
ey  picked up a number of girl
s, we was eight, nine girls. 
Most of the time the kids were the more educ
ated and understand, a
nd th ey can read and 
they can go through certain al
phabetical things to find ou
t what to do in a case like 
whatever it is, and we was given -- instead of
 having just the armband, the star, the 
Jewish star, we had th e Red Cross on top, and 
able to go to those 
sick people and help 
them because they was afraid to
 go.  That would kill them.  
They was afraid.  Typhus is 
such a disease that they would catch it. 
So they assigned us to catch this good 
(indecipherable). There was some -- and from thos
e -- it was nine girls.  From those nine 
girls, I'm the only one alive.  Every week somebody else was killed from the nine girls, 
just taken out and killed for some reason or 
another.  There's so ma
ny things that comes 
to me.  
Q: Sure, sure.  What about when
 you were living underground?  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
56 
A: There is no -- no -- actually there's no way 
a human being can even have the feeling or 
understand unless -- my kids don't even under
stand.  If I tell them how sick I was and 
when I had -- that was (speaking a foreign la
nguage).  For that reason, very few people 
survived  with medication, and I had -- you do
n't supposed to drink water for this.  You 
don't supposed to -- everything has to be bo
iled, cooked  and whatever, and cleanser is 
very, very  important.  We have no cleanser.  
We have no bath.  We 
have no hot water.  I 
had no tea.  I had to drink th e water from 
that -- bailed from the outside, and the bread, 
sometimes she brought down, it 
was mo lded inside.  She didn't  give us the bread wh ich 
she baked today or yesterday. 
 What was left through the we
ek, she put another batch of 
bread so she give us the old one, and th at 
bread I had to  eat, and my  time was six weeks I 
had trebunk (phonetic).  My son 
asked me one time what is t rebunk (phonetic).  I sa id it 's 
red.  I don't want to tell him.  It's a joke.  
Q: Did you -- did you need to 
be quiet during the day?  
A: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  There was no convers
ations, no noth ing. (Indecipherable).  He 
brought us every once in awhile a paper. Of c
ourse, the papers didn't  give us that mu ch, 
but at least we had something to read, and I 
was the one allowed to crochet, sewing for 
the people, for the farmer.  

Q: I see.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
57 
A: She brought me materials fro
m the city, and I cut -- as a ma
tter of fact, I had a couple 
nightgowns, beautiful nightgowns, I took it with
 me, and she liked it, 
but she didn't -- she 
was tall woman and I was a little short girl.  
Q: Yeah.  

A: So sh e wanted me to make community dre
sses for the Œ she had a little girl three years 
old.  

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: So I cut them through and make
 them and put little ribbons around. 
Q: You did that -- you did 
that with out talking?  
A: As a matter of fact, we had no light.  
If you ever talk to your father, he would 
understand what I'm saying.  He had those little
 lights, No. 3, with kerosine inside, and 
there were little things that stic
ks out, what do you call it?  
Q: A wick?  
A: Yes, the wick.  

Q: That you would light?  
A: And this couldn't stay lighted  because th
ere was no air. This was covered.  With seven 
people, had no air.  The light went out.  So
metimes I was sewing, and in the middle of 
everything the light is out.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
58 
Q: The light went out.  
A: You don't open the window because no window.  

Q: There's no window.  

A: You don't open the opening
 because you're afraid.  
Q: Yeah.  How terrible.  
A: Yeah.  As long as we can 
talk about it, we are alive.  We are happy.  We can tell the 
story.  What my  father could tell, what my  
mo ther could tell, what my  brothers.  They're 
not around to even hear that 
story.  I'm left by my self. 
Q: What about your father
; what happened to  him?  
A: He went to Treblinka.  
Q: He went to Treblinka?  
A: Yes, 1993 (sic).  I had a friend when she wa
s in the same train.  That's the reason I 
know.  The 6th of January, '93 (sic
) the train went to Germany.  
Q: '43?  
A: '43.  

Q: So th at was after you -- 

A: My father didn't see me
 from the day he left.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
59 
Q: So you to ok care of your mo ther, a
nd she came with you 
to Kansas City?  
A: Came to Kansas City.  She died here 25 
years ago.  She was a sick wo man but we took 
care of her.  We did the best we could.  
Q: Sure.  I'm sure she was 
very glad to have you.  
A: She was a beautiful person, 
so talented.  She could do ev
erything.  It's unbelievable, 
unbelievable.  She got herself a little house in Kansas City.  

Q: Really?  

A: And she put in her own little (indecipherable).  

Q: You're kidding?  

A: She put all the screens in
 the windows by herself.  
Q: Oh, wow.  
A: She was going ar
ound buying little
 hooks, all those things an
d make jewelry, went to 
the dime store and so ld the jewelry. Sh e could do anything.  Sh e could sew.  Sh e could -- 
it was nothing sh e couldn't do.  Just a very ta
lented person, but she suffered.  She had 
heart trouble since she co
me out from the bunker.  
Q: It's not surprising.  
A: We was young.  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
60 
Q: Terrible, yeah. A: Younger people.  Anothe
r thing, what killed her is when she lost 
that second son.  They k
illed him after liberation.  
Q: Yeah.  
A: After this, she was totally, like almost gone.  

Q: That was so unexpected too.  That's why --  

A: Yes.  

Q: You thought everything was fine with liberation.  
A: It could happen.  A car ac
cident could happen, a sickne
ss. Somebody is going to kill 
you after something like this and for no reason. 
 They didn't want anything.  Just we don't 
want you.  That's  all.  Yes.  All the stor
ies, like I say, peopl
e give you all those 
testimonial things, whatever, but there's real
l y  no way anybody can 
remember.  Maybe to 
them this is important, but there'
s so many mo re important things.  
Q: Yeah.  
A: And it's important -- it's mo st importa
nt is to tell the world to watch out.  
Q: That's true.  That's  true because you co
uld see -- you can see things happen ing in  the 
world and you --  
A: Yes.  We should all feel the same way. 
 We should support e
ducation.  We should 
support all those organizations, what they are 
doing, because that's  th
e only survival, and 

Interview with Maria Devinki  
61 
people are stupid and 
uneducated, don't know why, and 
somebody come in like Hitler, I 
will give you food, I will give you everythi
ng, screams and yells, and everybody says, 
okay, Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler, not knowing --  
Q: Not knowing what it means.  
A: Yes.  All right?  Anything else?  
Q: I've taken up a lot of your time.  

A: It's okay, it's okay.  I don't kno
w how important the story is to you.  
Q: It's very important.  
A: Will I get some tap e?  I'm interested to 
know what I said because admittedly I don 't 
remember.  I start talki
ng and it comes to me.  
Q: And you know when you
 listen, more things will come to you too.  
A: Oh, sure.  
Q: But I think, like you said, 
it's very important to do it.
 Very important to have --  
A: It's a different -- it's  a different story th an a lot of -- there's qu ite a few survivors from 
bunkers, from (indecipherable) 
in the forest and place like 
this, but the bunker story was 
really critical, very critical.  Life was so
 -- and the camps was uncomfortable, we know 
this, and there was nothing but danger and everyt
hing else, but to be 
and not to have the 
opportunity even 
to look out --  

Interview with Maria Devinki  
62 
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: -- and see, is it sunny?  Is it raining? 
 Wh en is a holiday?  We didn't know anything.  
Q: Anything at all.  
A: My mo th er had a book with
 her, a religious book, and we 
was trying to establish when 
is the holiday without trying to  see, is it
 dark, is it moon, is it what.  All right.  
Q: Well, thank you very mu ch.  
A: All right.
