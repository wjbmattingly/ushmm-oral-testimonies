Sam will s har e his
 
First Per s on
 
ac
c ount of his  life dur ing the Holoc aust for  about 45 m inutes .  
After whic h we will have an opportunity for  you to as k  a few questions  of h
im.  A nd if he is  willing, Sam  

t
o stay after a few minutes , we may even go a little beyond that tim e.
 
 
To orient you we
 
have pr epar ed a br ief s lide s how by way of introduc tion.  We begin with this 
por trait of Sam  taken just after the war with his  younger  s ister, Gis ele.  
 
 
Sam was  bor n in Dec ember
 
1937 in Poland in the c apital c ity ofWars aw, indic ated here by 
the arr ow.
 
 
Sam's father, Jac ob, was  a tailor and his m other, Sar a, was  a s eamstres s .  Thes e portraits  
were taken ar ound 1940. 
 
 
After Germany invaded Poland
, 
Septem ber
 
1, 1939, starting WorldWar II, Sam's  father, not 
long after, es c aped to Soviet
-
c ontr olled terr it
or
y.  
 
 
To make s ur e we're all
 
oriented, a r eminder, after the invas ion, the Soviet Union and Germ any 
who were allies  div ided Poland into two ar eas of c ontr ol.  The experienc e of J ews  was  very differ ent 
depending on whether they lived in Soviet or Germ an ter
ritory.
 

2 
 
 
Sam's father had moved on but for  r eas ons we will dis c us s  in the progr am , young Sam
 
--
 
he 
was  not quite 3 at the time
 
--
 
rem ained in Wars aw with his  mother, Sara.  And in this  pictur e we s ee 
Germ an tr oops  parading vic tor ious ly thr ough the streets  
of Wars aw. 
 
 
In Oc tober
 
1940, the Germ ans  es tablis hed a ghetto, a walled pr is on zone for J ews , in the c ity 
of War s aw.  The building where Sam and his  family had lived before was  in the ar ea that now bec am e 
par t of the ghetto.  So, in a s ens e, the ghetto wa
s  built up around them.
  
In this  photo, we c an s ee a 
s ec tion of the wall.  So 
a 
pr evious  c ity s tr eet is now s ealed off from the r est of the c ity. 
 
 
Eventually, thr ough c omplic ated s eries of events  and har d dec is ions , Sam and his  mother 
were able to reunite
 
with his  father .  They wer e s oon s ent to a forc ed labor c am p in Siber ia, in the 
Soviet Union, and then to a town c alled Syktyvkar, in the 
N
orther n Soviet r egion of Kom i.
 
 
Finally, in 1944, they wer e s ent to the Ukrainian town where Sam's little s is ter Gis ele was 
bor n.  They remained ther e for the r est of the war .
 
 
Her e we have a por tr ait of the family s hortly after they returned to Poland.  And after m any 
m or e m oves , whic h we will try to get to today
 
--
 
and I apologize if we have to rus h thr ough c omplic ate
d 
his tory
 
--
 
Sam  eventually , by the 1960s, m ade his way to the United States wher e he bec am e a 
s uc c es sful engineer , m arr ied, bec ame the proud father of three c hildren, one of whom is  her e today, his  
daughter Racquel, if I c an em barr ass  you by mak ing you wave to people.  Apparently as  of this  year , 
now has  s even, not s ix, grandc hildr en.  So we have a new baby to c elebr ate as well.
 
 
Pleas e join me in welc om ing Sam to the stage.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Sam  P onc zak:  Too hot.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  It is  too hot. 
 
>>
 
Sam  Ponc zak:  I hope everybody c an hear  me.  In the back , you c an hear  me?  Ok . 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Good.  We'll be c overing a lot of gr ound today
;  
literally, far too muc h to do it 
jus tic e, to do jus tic e to any life in the span of one brief c onver s ation.
  
So pleas e
 
--
 
Sam  knows  we have 
an understanding if I inter rupt him at times  or have to c ut him s hort, it's just s o we c an get as far as we 
c an.
 
 
So let's begin at your  beginning.  You wer e born in Dec em ber
 
1937 in Wars aw, whic h at the 
tim e was  by far  the
 
larges t J ewis h c ommunity in Eur ope.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  True.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  One
-
thir d J ewis h.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  There were about
 
--
 
m or e than thr ee million J ews  in Poland at the tim e.  They 
c ons tituted about 10% of the population.  So it's a large m inor
ity group, yeah.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  In Ger m any, J ews  made up less than 1% of the population, in c om paris on s ak e.  

So it's a more heavily J ewis h area.
 
 
Let m e start by you telling us  a bit about your  family, your par ents , extended family, their  wife 
before the war , pleas e. 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  My par ents c om e fr om  sm all little towns  in Poland.  Som e of them ar e har d to find 
even on the m ap.  Youngster s made 
their way to Wars aw bec aus e that's  where the action was .  That's 
wher e they c ould learn a tr ade and s tart their young life inWars aw.  My father was  a tailor and my 
m other  was  a s eam str ess .  They didn't have m uch of an educ ation.  I think  m y father  had abo
ut 
five
 
--
 
finis hed fifth gr ade and my mother about four th gr ade.
  
They got mar ried over  a year  befor e I was  
bor n.  They s poke amongst thems elves  in Yiddis h, J ewis h language.  Although they did s peak  Polis h.
 
 
My father was  involved as  a young man with the trade unions , a typic al thing for a tailor  to do. 
 
My m other had thr ee brother s that lived there with their fam ilies .  The par ents  stayed in the old town 
wher e they c am e fr om.  It was  bas ic ally a poor life.  They went thr ough depres s ion in Poland like 
ever
y wher e els e.  I guess  that m or e or les s des c ribes  the life.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  How m any s iblings  did your  father have?
 

> > Sam  Ponc zak:  My father had had ac tually four s iblings.  There were two brother s who emigrated 
fr om  Poland in the 1930s to Argentina.
  
One br other lived in War s aw.  And another brother, an older 
one from a different mother
, h
e was  old enough to be
 
--
 
he took par t inWorld War I.  
 

3 
 
 
What I know about him  was  that as s oon as  that war ended, he mar ried appar ently a Germ an 
J ewis h woman and he was  not part of my father's life in Poland.  The only trac e I have of him  was  a 
fr iend of m ine who vis ited the c onc entration c amp found his  name, David Ponc zak, bor n in 
1890
-
s om ething.  He died of pneum onia.  It was  inter esting that a whole lis t of people who died that 
day, they all died of pneum onia in 1940
 
--
 
I don't rem em ber, three or  four.  So that bas ic ally was  death 
c am p.  They were put to death.  The Germans  had to wr ite down c aus e.  So that day it was  pneumonia.  

Yeah. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Befor e
 
the war wer e your  par ents, grandparents, r eligious ?  Was J udaism 
important?
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  My grandpar ents, I'm s ure, wer e religious .  My par ents  were not religious .  They 
were the labor m ovement, unions , you know.  They were educ ated, m y father  went to
 
the Seder
 
and he 
knew how to pr ay. When we were in Baltim or e, he was  conduc ting the Pas s over  
Seder s
 
and he did it 
r eligious ly, the way it s hould have been done. Wouldn't let them tell him to c ut it s hort, etc .  He went 

thr ough the whole thing.  So even though he was  not religious , he had lots of res pec t.  
 
 
As  a m atter of fac t, wher e I was  born, the r abbi
 
--
 
and her e's  m y father, the lefty.  And the 
r abbi bec ame the best friends .  He was  telling me very often that he had lots  of res pect for him just like
 
the r abbi had r es pect for him.  Gr eat ac c omm odation. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So you were not quite 3 year s  old when Germ any s tarted World War II by invading 

Poland.  And Wars aw was  s ubjec ted to ver y, ver y heav y bombing, high death tolls , m as s ive 
des tr uction.
  
What do you know from  talking to your  par ents later
 
--
 
you wer e too young to r emem ber.  
What do you know about what they did and felt during thos e unc ertain weeks and m onths ?
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Of c our s e, I per s onally don't rem em ber .  I was  jus t too s m all.
  
But what I do know 
c om es fr om m y par ents or from  r eading s ome of what I think ar e r eliable sourc es , his tor ic al s ourc es .
 
Wars aw was
 
literally a
 
naked c ity.  It was  bom bed by the Ger man Air  Forc e, str afed
.  T
her e was  no 
pos ition to that thing.  As far as I
 
r em ember the fac ts , there was  about 20,000 people wer e killed during 
thes e months  of bom bardm ent.  It was  s uc h that the dead had to be buried in park s , wher ever  there 

was  a piec e of land that they c ould be bur ied.  And, of c our s e, within a few days , ther e
 
were s hortages 
of water and food and electric ity.  So it was  a mis er able time.
 
 
Ac c ording to m y mother , appar ently m y building was  hit in s om e part and there was  a family 
that was  killed in that apar tm ent that was  hit.
 
 
Of c ours e, you know, recently I was
 
thinking about m y par ents .  They wer e in their 20s, late 
20s , and they had a kid on their hands and ther e was  a s ituation where nobody knew what was  going to 
happen, what to do.  The Polis h government ran away on the thir d day of the war .  They found thei
r 
way thr ough Rom ania to England.  Ther e was  nobody in c harge.  There was  s om e militar y that they 
tr ied to fight, the Germ ans .  But the Germans  walked intoWars aw, I believ e, in the 20
-
s omething of 
Dec ember.
  
At the s ame tim e, bec aus e of the pact between Hitler  and Stalin, the Soviets  attack ed 
Poland fr om the 
E
ast on the 17th of Septem ber .  So Poland
 
c eas ed to exis t.  
 
 
I was  thinking, if I would be in the s hoes of m y par ents, I wouldn't k now what to do.  So they 
dec ided that they would s plit.  They didn't 
divor c e but my father wanted to right away r un to the 
Soviet
-
oc c upied par t of Poland bec aus e he felt that it's  s afer.  My m other in turn, s he didn't want to 
leave her fam ily behind.  They had an agreement
 
--
 
the pos tal s ys tem work ed s o they m ust have 
s om eh
ow c ommunic ated.
  
So it went on for a while.  
 
 
Of c ours e, at s ome point in tim e my m other, as we would s ay, s aw the light.  She r ealized that 
ther e's  not muc h future hanging around in what bec am e the ghetto.  She tells  m e that one day s he 
m ade it to the t
r ain station.  From  what s he tells  me
 
--
 
am I getting ahead of mys elf?
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  No.  Keep going.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  The Jews  wer e not allowed to tr avel at the tim e.  Well, s he m ade it.  And I don't 

know how.  She was  r esourc eful.  Made it into a wagon.  Luckily, s he s ays
,  
ther e was  a pr iest that 
planted hims elf in fr ont of her  and told her  to take the arm band off.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  The arm  band that m arked her as a J ew.
 

4 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Right. With the star.  And they were ar ound asking for identific ations .  He s aid
, ﬁT
he 
woman with the kid is  from  m y paris h.
ﬂ
  
I believe that this  unknown pr ies t saved my life.  I am s ure that 
m y m other didn't m ak e any ar rangem ent for the m an to be there.  I think it's purely c oinc idental that he 
happened to be ther e and he did what he did. 
 
 
Now, don't ask  me how we m ade it bec aus e the goal was  to get to the riv er boat whic h was  
the dem ar c ation line between the Soviet par t and the Ger man part.  She planned it bec aus e to be 

ther e, it was  the end of the year , pr obably Novem ber.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  1940.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Right.  Right.  And to be able to c r oss  over  the r iver bec aus e the r iver  was  typic ally 
fr ozen at that tim e.  It was  a terr ible winter.  The r iver , indeed, was  frozen.  The thing s he tells  me is 
that 
s he picked a night
 
--
 
of c ours e, at night
 
--
 
to walk acros s bec aus e you won't s ee.  Bec aus e we 
c ould have been s hot by either the Germ ans or the Soviets .  T
hey didn't k now who was  
c oming.  Well, 
s he tells  me a s ad s tory about m ys elf
; t
hat I was  having lots
 
of fun and s he kept s lip
p
ing and falling 
down and I thought that was  hilar ious .  And I was  laughing
 
ve
r y loud.  And, of c ours e, that's  what she 
was  afr aid, that I was  laughing bec aus e it was  heard.  So s he tr ied to give me s omething to do, 

s om eth
ing to 
ta
ke c ar e of.  I did.  I tor e them apart by the tim e we made it to the other  s ide.  And now 
it's my wound.  I carry that guilt of 
des troying all the [Inaudible].
  
She was  telling me about s ome dogs, 
the guards .  Of c our s e, I don't rem em ber thes e details .
 
 
Ev
entually we were c onnec ted with m y father.  It mus t have been the m iddle
 
--
 
we pr obably 
lived s om e tim e in that
 
area where m y father lived in Western Belar us but eventually we were s ent to a 
labor  c amp in Siber ia.  It was  from reading later on I knew it was  a plac e wher e the 
Gulags  
exis ted.  
And it was  known from  the tim e of the c zars, a 
Gulag 
plac e.  And that's  wher e I bec am e s elf
-
aware, 
about four year s , m aybe four and a half year s,
 
as a kid, wher e I was  and r em em ber  pictur es of that 
plac e. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  If I may inter rupt for a m inute
.  
I think  most of us  ar e muc h more fam iliar with the 
Holoc aus t tr ajector y of ghetto to death c amp.  But am ong s ur vivors , Sam
™s
 
story is more typical.  Of the 
thr ee m illion Polis h J ews from befor e the war  only about 250,000 wer e s till alive at the end of the war.  

The vas t m ajor ity of them  s urvived bec aus e they ended up in Soviet ter ritor y. 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  That's tr ue.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: Wher e the s ituation was  differ ent. 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  It's a telling num ber bec aus e Jews  wer e des per ately trying to leave.  And it jus t so 
happens  that no c ountr y would ac c ept them.  And whoever was  luc ky enough to be in the Soviet Union 
at leas t had a c hanc e to sur vive.  And that was  our  fate.
 
 
I r em ember the labor c am p.  My father, the tailor , bec ame a lum berjack .  The reas on is  
bec aus e that c amp was  in the m iddle of the Siberian jungle, if one c an descr ibe it.  They had lots of 

tr ees.  They needed the wood to be c ut and to s end down the r iver  to whatever  plac e that it was  going 
to be us ed in.  Whatever  the wood was  being us ed for.
  
So I do r em em ber that c amp.
 
 
Many year s  later, I think in one of m y travels
,  
I did talk to m y father about that c am p bec aus e I 
did remem ber it.  I was  s truck  by the s tr ange fac es , the look  of people.  I remember  it was  s omething 

s tr ange about that plac e.  And I had a dis c us s ion with him.  And he was  telling m e, look , fir st of all,
 
it 
was  a labor c amp, physic al exer tion; a lot of people ar e not used to that, phys ic al effort.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  And they wer e for c ed.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  They were for c ed to do it otherwis e they c ouldn't get any food.
 
 
Sec ond, there was  depr avation in the
 
s ens e that there was no tobac c o.  People in thos e year s  
s m oked.  You know s omebody who is  depr ived if you s m oke is behaving str angely.  And s om e like to 
dr ink  vodka and ther e was  no vodka.  And they us ed to dr ink  c ologne.  It's s tr ange but ther e was  no 
vo
dka.  There was  no tobac c o but they s moked bark or s ome m oss .  You wondered that people were 
m is erable.  There was  high death rate.
 
 
I do know that it was  a mix.  It was n't just J ews .  Ther e were Pols  and all kinds  of other  
people.
  
The natives that we got
 
to m eet, they ar e of Mongolian kind of de
s
c ent.  They s poke a 

5 
 
language that is hard to des c r ibe.  Apparently I s tar ted to learn that language.  Appar ently that was my 
fir s t c ons c ientious  language.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Can you des c ribe a little 
bit the livi
ng c onditions  ther e?
  
Wer e you with your 
par ents? What was  the food like? 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  I do remember living
 
--
 
I don't know how m any of you k now.  It's like a Mongolian 
tent.  I don't rem em ber  the arrangem ent, whether  it was  outs ide the c am p or  ins ide.  The point is that 

ther e was  nowher e to esc ape.  Nobody could es cape even though there was  no wires , ba
rb
ed wir es , 
etc .
  
Where would you es c ape when everything els e is  a thous and miles  from  you?
 
 
Anyhow, s o I r em em ber  that.  Ther e was  an old native person ther e, lady, that lived in it.  I 
r em em ber it m ust have been winter wher e the s now almos t c overed the tent.  J ust c urios ity.  It was 

interes ting that the door was  opening inward ins tead of outward bec ause nobody would go out if the 

door  was  opening outw
ar ds . 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  It was  s nowed in
; 
it was  s o remote.
 
> > Sam  Ponczak:  It was  rem ote.  And, of c ours e, I r emember  we had to open the door and my father 
would s pend hours digging us  out from the s nowfall.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  How long did you r emain
 
in Siber ia?
 
> > Sam  Ponczak: Well, later
 
--
 
fr om that later c am p we were s ent to the capital c ity of the r epublic , 
Syktyvkar .  That's  wher e my father  was  engaged to wor k  in the factor y, s ewing uniform s for the m ilitar y, 
and s o m y m other.  In Syk tyvkar , I 
als o
 
--
 
well, we los t my two twin brothers .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Can you explain?  We hadn't heard about brother s befor e. 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Yeah.  They died.  I remem ber them.  They died when they wer e 2 months old.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Your  mother  bec ame pregnant while you wer e liv ing ther e
. 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Right.  I don't know why they died.  My m other didn't want to talk  about it.  I don't 
know. 
 
 
So we s tayed there
 
--
 
and, of c ours e, that's  when I lear ned my first language, Rus s ian.  And I 
bec am e aware of the war .  Fr om the P.A. s ys tem , we would hear how the Rus s ian br ave Arm y was 
r etreating and so on.  And then Stalin, what happened.  And then the Russ ian Arm y was  going the 
other way. 
 
 
In any event
 
--
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  The P.A. s ys tem, was  this  in s c h
ool? 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Kinder garten or
 
--
 
yeah, bec aus e they had to put me s omewher e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: While your  parents  wer e forced to work .
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  They were working, r ight.  Yeah.  So we lived ther e until about 1944.  And then the 

gover nm en
t sent us  to Uk r aine bec aus e Ukraine was  alr eady liber ated fr om the Germ ans.
  
The reas on
, 
I found out later
, 
was  that m y par ents  c hos e not to take the Soviet c itizens hip, whic h was  offered by the 
Soviet gover nm ent, but they wanted to r etur n to Poland to find out what happened to the fam ilies .  They 
did not know.  So they chos e not to do it and becaus e of that they s ent us Uk raine.
 
 
And then for  s om e time m y father  worked on a farm.  He was  dr iving a c om bine.  And then we 
were moved again, wher e m y s is ter was  bor n.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So you c over ed a lot of ground and not by your  own c hoos ing.  Your mother takes 
this  big ris k  to leave Poland.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Right.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  You're s ent to Siber ia.  You're s ent north.  The Komi Republic  is  by the 
A
r ctic  
C
ir cle, s o we're r eally talking about a rem ote, desolate plac e
, a

>> Sam  
Ponc zak:  One day m y father  took m e along to a plac e.  I didn't k now what it was  but it was  a 

big room.  And the room was  full of s oldier s, young m en in unifor m s.

> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Right after  the end of the war , right.  I did not know what was  going on but I s aw 
thes e young m en in unifor ms c r ying.  They wer e going like this .  They wer e s aying things.  I didn't know 
wher e I was  and what was  happening.  Many, many year s  later
 
--
 
but I rem em ber the event.  I was 
as king father what was  it.  It was  the firs t Yom Kippur after  the war.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  A solem n day on the J ewis h c alendar .
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Right.  Apparently thes e people were J ewis h offic er s and s oldier s  who c elebr ated it 
in s om e r oom .  I said, "Why were they c rying?"  He s ays , 
w
ell, they just c am e from  Ger many and 
Poland and they s aw what the Holoc aust does. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So they m ay have been c amp liberators  fighting in a Soviet 
uniform. 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Yeah.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  I'd like to back  up if we c ould.  I'm c urious about given the fact that to this  point 

your  entire c ons c ious  life has  been in wartim e, s huttled around, in exile.  When did you really 
unders tand that you wer e Jewis h?  And if you c ould tell us  about an event at a flea m arket.
 
> > Sam  Ponczak:  Yeah.  That was  fir st tim e
 
--
 
I didn't know I was J ewis h or  Mongolian or whatever.  
One day we went to a flea market, a farm er's  market, to buy s om ething.  So it's my f
ather, m y mother  
and I.  We wer e there.  And I s ee an invalid.  I m ean, this  man had no legs, was  on one of thos e c ar ts 

with wheels ; obvious ly a war time vic tim.  He started to yell at us , "
Y
ou dirty J ews ," "
H
ow did 
you 
s ur vive," you know.  I didn't know what was  going on.  When I asked father what was  going on, he said, 
"W
ell, I have to tell you;
 
we ar e J ewis h."  So that's  the firs t tim e I found out that I was  J ewis h.  It's an 
interes ting way to find out.  During the war there was  no r eligious  life.  I didn
't s ee
 
--
 
I was n't old enough 
to rec ognize the differ enc e from J ewis h to non
-
J ewis h.  That was  the firs t event that made m e awar e 
who I am. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  You m entioned your  parents were unders tandably eager to r etur n to Poland to s ee 

if they c ould find any family m em bers .
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  That's tr ue.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Aliv e.  When did you return to Poland?  Can you tell us  about that tr ip?
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Yeah.  So we s tayed until winter.  I s uppos e J anuar y
 
1946 we boar ded s ome train, 
we and m any
 
other people, J ews  obvious ly, who tr aveled to Poland.  These wer e c attle c ars , you k now, 
open, in the m iddle of the winter .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Open, no roof, expos ed to elements.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Yeah.  It was  open to the air
 l
ik e a r egular c argo wagon. 
 
That tr ip was  about thr ee 
weeks  of terr ible cold.  I remember I got s ome piec e of c oal in m y eye.  Anyhow.
  
So we traveled about 
three weeks  and ended up in the wes ter n part of Poland.  
 
 
I jus t found out a few year s  ago
 
--
 
I was  tr ying to find out why we
 
ended up there, wher e we 
ended up.  That was  an interesting stor y.  I didn't think butWars aw was  liter ally des tr oyed, like 90% of 

Wars aw was  leveled.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  During the war .
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Yeah.  During the war .  Right.  Cer tainly the ghetto was completely leveled.  But 

ther e was  a plan
 
--
 
you see, what happened before the end of the war, again, between Roos evelt, 
Churc hill and Stalin they negotiated the m ap of Europe and they m oved s om e bor ders
.  They gave 
Poland a piec e of Eastern Ger m any.
  
And Poland in tur n gave a rewar d to the Soviets of the e
astern 
par t of Poland.  And the plan was  to liter ally move all the Ger man population out.  So that was  m y firs t 

expos ur e to ethnic c leans ing.  Now, it was n't in the s ens e that they wer e killed but they wer e 
enc ouraged to pack up and leave.  
 
 
So the eas ter n par t of Ger m any, in a sm all town
 
--
 
now it's lower  Siles ia, it was  bas ic ally 
voided of people.  Not 100% but mos t of the Germans .  And I r emember them going to the town I 

ar r ived at.  So when we a
rr ived at the town, the train I remember, s aw the Germ an s igns, the s ign of 
the town of Reic henbac h
--
 
s till in German. We were told bec aus e they didn't have tim e to fix 
ever ything.  So we arr ived to Reic henbach.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  By fix you m ean de

Germ
anize it.

> > Sam  Ponc zak:  And then it was  ethnic cleansed.  I rem em ber  the long lines  of elder ly m en and 
women, Ger man wom en, going with their baby c arr iages  loade
d up with s tuff, going to the 
tr ain s tation.  
Obvious ly moving into Germ any.
  
I didn't s ee any young Germ ans , of c ours e.  Thes e wer e little towns  
that wer e not str ategic ally im portant.  They wer e not destroyed.  
 
 
We lived for s om e months  with a German lady, elder ly Germ an Liddy, until s he m oved 
on

lady, until s he moved on of the
 
it was  first time we lived in an apar tment, that I r emember.  
Com pared to my pr evious  plac es  of habitation.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: What was  the Polis h name of the town?
 

> > Sam  Ponc zak:  The Polis h nam e bec ame Dzierzoniow.  It is ac tually the nam e of a Mediev
al s aying 
[Indis c ernible], etc.  It took  a few year s
 
--
 
a little les s  before it was  renamed.
 
 
Now, it was  an inter esting s tor y bec
aus e we are not the only family.
  
It turns  out that in that 
town, in 1946, ther e was  about 26 or s o thous and of J ews that s uddenly s howed up in this  town. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Go on. 
 
> > Sam  Ponczak:  I found out rec ently, talking to s om e friends in Poland, about how c ome I ended up 

ther
e.  It was  like it was  des igned to be this  way.  I found out, br iefly talking, that a per s on who was  a 
Zionis t ac tivis t befor e the war and then bec am e a s oc ial ac tivis t and political
 
--
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Corroborat
or?
 
> > Sam  Ponczak:  He had the idea of r es ettling Jews  who c ame fr om Russ ia in that area of Poland that 
was  jus t given to Poland by Unc le J oe, Roos evelt, to make that like a J ewis h enc lave, like a J ewis h 
r epublic  or s om ething lik e that.  And that was  the reas on why m any of these tr ains  wer e s en
t into that 
par t of Poland.  And the town that I was  in the larges t J ewis h population of any
 
plac es  in this  Poland 
after  th
e war .  I m ean, J ews  lived in
 
other towns  in that ar ea, too.
  
Eventually it all c ollaps ed and 
nothing of it happened but that was  the
 
intent.  It turns out that he was  the father of my good friend, 
Ric hard, with whom I went to s c hool later on. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Could you tell us  a little about that c ommunity of Polis h J ewis h survivor s  who had 

s udde

>> 
Sam  Ponc zak:  Yeah.  They were all plopped ther e.  They bec ame very

thes e people that 
s ur vived, they'r e ver y active.  I k now that my father and a few other J ews  dec ided r ight away to form  a 
c oop, som e tailor ing c o
-

found s ewing m ac hines  in the hous es.  They wer e ver y entr epreneur ial.  They form ed the c o

op.  There 
s tarted to be tr uly a kind of Jewis h life.  Ther e was  a s ynagogue.  Ther e was  ac tual news paper s .  I'm 
told about a per iod of about two year s  after  the war  it was  ver y ac tive.  I r em ember  as a kid I was

we had boy s c outs , ther e was  J ewis h boy s c outs.  Ar ound the town ther e were thes e farm s, 
organized farm s
 
wher e Jews  were farm ing, working with farm er s.  J ews  were coal miner s in other 
towns , a lot of things that we don't attribute, we don't think about thes e people. 
 
 
There was  als o many orphans .  At the s am e time the c ommunities wer e for med, ther e was  a 
m ovement of s ending lots  of orphans to Is r ael, to Pales tine at the tim e.  Ther e was  no Is r ael yet.  And I 

do rem em ber  being

s pending m onths , a s ummer , in this boy s c out c amp wher e they taught us how to 
pitc h tents, how to light fir es , how to s urvive in the woods .  It was  good m onths  of training. 
 
People were r em indi

thes e or phans out of Poland and take them to Pales tine, eventually to Is rael.  Of c ours e my parents  
didn't let m e go with the other kids , s o I s tayed.

you m entioned orphans.  There are a lot of people who ar e 
jus t sor t of s c attered remnants  of their family.  Can you tell us  about s c enes  you remember from the 

tr ain station in this town, how people would go
 
--
 
> > Sam P onc zak:  Oh, yes .  I
 
r em ember m y father  us ed to tak e m e at least twic e a week bec aus e he 
knew the trains  were c om ing.  The main goal of the s ur vivors  was  to find family and fr iends.  So he 

would go with m e when he knew the trains were c om ing. We would walk into this wagons  and he 
would look around and see if he would find s om ebody, went to the next wagon.  And that's

> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Looking for a fam iliar fac e?

> > Sam  Ponc zak:  That's right.  He found his friend fr om his  little town, Wielun.  He bas ic ally s aid, 
c om e on
 
out, pull him out.  There wer e two c hildr en there at the tim e.  Bec aus e m y father already was  
an organizer  of the c o
-
op and a tailor
, said c om e on out;
 
we'll find you a plac e to live, get you a job. 
 
 
Well, the boy is  a friend of mine who lives  in Columbia, Mar yland.  Us ed to wor k  for the Navy.  
And the s is ter is  a s uc c es sful bus ines s woman in Baltimor e.  Sinc e that time they had two mor e 

br others .  So they bec am e fam ily.  They bec ame unc le and aunt.
 
 
Out of my family, no one exc ept one c ous in s urviv ed.  One c ous in who pr es ently lives  in New 
York.  The s tory is  s imilar to my s tor y in the s ense that m y unc le, just like m y father, m ade an 

agr eem ent with his  wife that he would es c ape to the Soviet
-
oc c upied Rus sia and my aunt and m y 
c ous in who joined him som ehow.  But the story of this uncle is different.  They never  m et.  So my uncle, 

apparently, dec ided to r etur n to Poland to look for his  wife and c hild.  He never  made it alive.
 
 
Now, my aunt and m y c ous in did m ake it to the Soviets  and that's how they s urvived
.  So it's 
fate, I s uppos e.  In m y cas e, was  kind to us.  But in her  c as e, no. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  I hear d you talk about how y ou felt after Septem ber
 
11.
 
> > Sam  Ponczak:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Ther e was  a J ewis h c om m unity that was  es tablis hed.  They had a 

bu

looking for fam ilies.  I 
r em em ber s eeing on the walls  of the building, on the outs ide, you know, paper s , have you s een s uch 

and s uc h from s uc h and s uc h a town.  I don't r emember photographs but ther e m ay have been 

photogr aphs.  The whole wall was with handwritten notes.  As  m entioned som ewher e, I don't 
r em em ber, but it reminded me that in 9/11 when the building collaps ed, I read or s aw the s ame thing, 
the fenc es or walls  wer e plas tered with "have you s een":
 
 " H
ave you seen" actually  had a lot of im pac t on my wor k  here.  My mother
 
--
 
our fam ily was  a 
r ar ity that the whole fam ily as  a unit s ur vived bec aus e typic ally it was  a m an, a woman, or  a c hild.  Ver y 

r ar ely a parent or  c hild survived.  Mos t s ur vivors  wer e s ingle, m en, or  wom en or c hildren. 
 
My m other 
was  a very hos pitable.  People would c om e, on weekends they would hav e dinner s  or  lunc hes, 

whatever .  The typic al people wer e sur vivors , s ome fr iends , s om e friends  of fr iends .  They s poke
 
Yiddis h am ong them s elves .  I at the time understood.  I didn't s peak  but I was  old enough to 
unders tand.  It was  a rather  s ad affair  bec aus e they often cried, drank  vodka and cr ied bec aus e they 

tr ied to put out a lot of things out of their minds .
 
 
I remem
ber on two oc c as ions  I met people who I later  m et in Baltim or e.  One of them was  a 
s ur vivor  of Aus c hwitz.  He was  telling
 
--
 
that's what I r em ember well, how the ones that wer e doomed 
and wer e led to the gas  c ham ber s, etc., they knew wher e they wer e going.
  
If s om ebody s ays , no, they 
weren't aware, m aybe the fir st few thous ands.  But thes e people knew. 
 
They would scream to the 
others behind the wir es , 
ﬁD
o not forget us,
ﬂ 
ﬁR
emem ber us ,
ﬂ  
ﬁR
em ember us .
ﬂ
  
That was  like, you k now, 
you think  about it, it was  a las t wis h of people who knew. 
 
 
Well, I r emem ber thes e talks.  And year s  later when I s tar ted to work  her e, volunteer, I was  
tr ans lating video tapes , videotaped inter views , of Polis h people, J ewis h Polis h people.  The inter views  

were done in the m id 
`
80s , m
aybe 
`
90s.  The topic  was  the inter viewees  wer e people, Polis h or Polis h 
or igin, who lived in the areas  wher e the ghettos  wer e form ed, who knew the conc entration c amps , or 
knew the r aids , things that were happening.  And they wer e s imply as ked:  Des c r ibe what you s aw 
looking from  outs ide.  A few of the r es ults I remem ber, the youngs ter s
 
--
 
the people that were being 
interviewed were youngs ter s, teenager s at the time when the war  brok e out.  So they wer e not adults in 

the s ens e, typic ally in their 20s , teens
 
to 20s.  And the few tapes that I tr ans lated des cribed how this  
bunc h of kids , boys , were laying around s ome r oad where J ews  wer e being led to be exec uted in the 

forest s omewher e.  They des c ribed the old, the young, the c hildr en.  And what they notic ed wa
s  the 

people that wer e being marc hed, k ids on the s ide of the road, "P

Pray to God," 
"Remember us," "R

in s ome ways  it bec ame m y c aus e here

> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Sam, I think  s ometim es in this  er a of im m ediate infor mation it is  eas y for  us to

happening in Po

ther e was  a rec ord that the Mus eum  had

family fr om my father's  s ide or m y mother's s ide other than that.  No r ec ords . 
 
 
It stands to reas on bec aus e the destroying of 
E

Germ ans did not even bother to keep rec ords .  They wer e the so

c alled com mandoes  whos e

:  Didn't keep r ec ords  or names.  Ther e was  no point.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: We have a few minutes left.  A c ouple m or e
 
things  I would like to ask  you about.  
In 1948, you did actually return to your  birthplac e of Wars aw with your father .  Tell us about that. 
 
> > Sam  Ponczak:  In 1948, m y father took  m e on a train r ide to War s aw.  I did not know at the time but 

the oc c as ion was  the unveiling of a monument that was  built to c om m em orate the ghetto
 
--
 
the Wars aw 
Ghetto Upris ing.  In 1943, in Apr il, ther e was  an upr is ing of the ghetto, the J ewis h ghetto.  The ghetto 

was  being liquidated, people being s ent to their death in various  c onc entration c am ps.  But the leftover 
dec ided that they will fight.  There was  a lot of material about his tor ic  fight.  They fought almost literally 

to the last m an, c hild, and wom an. 
 
 
Five year s  later a monum ent was  built in their mem or y.  So I was  ther e witnes s ing the 
unveiling of that m onument.  I do rem em ber David Ben
-
Gurion, who at the time
 
--
 
no, Isr ael was n't 
form ed yet I think bec aus e it was  April.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Yeah.  In a few weeks  he would bec om e the fir st prime m inis ter .
 
> > Sam  P onc z
ak:  The state of Israel was  going to be created.  But he c ame and he gave a talk.  He 
s poke in Yiddis h to pr obably a few thous and men and women.  I s aw that m onum ent.
  
And then my 
father took m e for  a walk.  He stopped at
 
s ome point and he s aid, "I think this  is  the building wher e you 
were born."  Bec aus e the Wars aw Ghetto was  liter ally leveled.
 
 
I have to tell you s om ething that you pr obably don't know.  I was  at the Polis h C
ons ulate 
libr ar y.  There's a libr ar y in DC.  A few m onths ago they 
s
howed a film 
that I went to s ee but befor e that 
film was  s hown there was a five
-
m inute film  that was  made fr om an airplane, a s mall air plane.  That film 
was  made about a few months  after the war  ended.  He was  flying and with the c am er a they were 
filming the Wars aw Ghetto, the ar ea of the Wars aw Ghetto.  That film was  film ed pr ior .  It was  
interes ting.  I looked and I s aid
 
--
 
it's inter es ting becaus e what you s aw was  a large, flat ar ea and at the 
edges of that ar ea wer e remnants of buildings
 b
ut s tanding buildings.  So 
I knew that that ar ea was  
s ignific ant.  That was  the area of the ghetto.  Nothing stood up ther e.  There was  no r em nants of walls  

s tanding up or what have you.  It was  liter ally obliter ated
 
to the ground.  And only the areas  of the edge 
of the ghetto was  d
es troyed.  They des troyed buildings  but you could still s ee the structure of the 

building.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Literally a s c ar on the lands cape of the city.
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Right.  One c em eter y, I gues s  you c an s ay, yeah. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: We ar e almost out of tim e bec aus e I do want our audienc e to have a c hanc e to 
as k  questions .  Your family s tayed in Poland much longer  than m any other J ewis h s ur vivor s  of the 
Holoc aus t.  Until what year  wer e you there?  Why did you s tay?  Why did you leave? 
 
> > Sam  Po
nc zak: We s tayed until 1957.  It s o happened
 
--
 
I was  asking that s ame ques tion of m y 
par ents.  Appar ently they did get a visa to go to Argentina.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: Wher e your unc les were?
 

> > Sam  Ponc zak:  Yeah.  Right.  But it just s o happened that the
 
Ir on Curtain fell down before that, so 
forget it; you c annot leave the c ountr y.
 
 
In the m eantim e I c ompleted high sc hool in this  town.  And in 1957 there was  again an 
anti
-
Semitic pus h bec aus e what happened was , if you r emem ber, the 1956 c ampaign wher e Is
r ael, the 
Ar ab forc es, and, of c ours e, the Soviet Union forced Poland to br eak  r elations hip with Is r ael.  They had 

10
 
 
to light up m or e anti
-
Semitism stuff.
  
At that time one of the things  was  to antagonize the Polis h agains t 
the s o
-
c alled J ewis h
 
--
 
bas ic ally 
s aying to the unions , we don't want J ewis h manager s  to manage 
Polis h wor kers .  So people wer e being thrown out fr om work  bec aus e they were J ewis h and s o on.  So 
it s tarted as a m as s exodus  in 1957, about 50,000 or s o J ews  left Poland. 
 
 
We had for m any different reas ons
 
--
 
we or iginally wer e forc ed to go to Is rael but we c ouldn't.  
We end up being in Fr anc e for  two year s .  And then half of the tim e in Italy bec aus e we had only a 

tr ans it vis a.  So it was  har d tim es.
 
 
Then after that, the Frenc h polic e arres ted us and bas ic ally told us  to leave.  We ended up 
going to Argentina.  I lived ther e for a good five and a half year s .  It jus t s o happens that they wouldn't 
r ec ognize m y high s c hool diplom a.  I wanted to be an engineer but I c ouldn't.  They told me to go
 back 
to high sc hool again.
 
 
So I m ade all kinds  of effor ts to c om e to the United States  with m y fam ily.  I was  s uc c es sful in 
getting m y par ents , my father, imm igr ation status bec aus e he was  able to get a c ontr act to work fr om  a 
c om pany Ham burger
s 
in B alti
more.  I don't know how m any of you ar e old enough to r em ember that.  
But he c ame as a tailor.  I c ame as  a for eign student whic h in a way, meant that I had no c hoic e but to 

leave wherever  I was  going to after I finis hed m y s tudies .  Anyhow, I m et my wife,
 
Racquel's  mom.  We 
got m arr ied.  I finis he
d my s tudies .  I got a job at RCA

m ade a living. When the news  c am e

they pr obably hear d it fr om  the r adio.  Ther e was  actually a 
Soviet offic er that lived near by.  And all of thes e men got s o dr unk.  I had
 
never s een m y father s o 
dr unk.  And then, of c ours e, I r ealized.  I was  old enough to know that the war ended.  Yes , I r em ember 
that.  My father  being s o drunk.  [Laughter ] 
 
He held his  alc ohol well. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Other  questions ?  Don't be shy.  We have one her e. 
 
>> 
You m entioned how when you wer e younger and during the war  and in the ghetto how ther e was n't 
m uc h religious  ac tivity.  Was that jus t in your family or  was  that c omm on dur ing the war
 
wher e you 
were?
 

> > Sam  Ponc zak:  I would s ay it's m y
 
family.  I wouldn't s ay it's  c ommon.  Of c ours e ther e wer e 
r eligious  people.  You're talking about the time when I was  in Wars aw?
 

>> 
During the war . 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak: Well, dur ing the war  I was  a sm all c hild s o I pers onally  don't r em em ber.  But I k now 
fro
m  other Holoc aus t s urvivor s  who wer e in the ghetto that there was  all kinds  of activities .  A lot was  in 
educ ating the c hildren not in the s ens e of entertaining them but taking their  m inds  off of how they lived 

and what they s aw.  There was  theater.  Ther e
 
was  a lot of tr ying to take care of the youngs ter s .  But, 
of c ours e, there were pr oblem s  of c hildr en lying and dying on the s tr eets.  So that was  not unc ommon.

Edna Fr iedberg:  If I could interjec t.  I think  part of what Sam is  des cr ibing is  a phenom enon we talk  
about as s pir itual res is tanc e.  It's  dr am atic  to think  about people fighting with guns , violently.  But all

how m any of you are going up to the Perm anent Exhibition 
now?  Ok.  Good.  So on the third floor, whic h will be your s ec ond level down, you will s ee a ver y lar
ge 
m ilk  c an, a rusty old c an, whic h is  an artifac t fr om theWars aw Ghetto wher e Sam was  as  a c hild whic h 
was  us ed as  part of a s ec r et ar c hive to c ollec t and r ec or d the exper ienc es and hopes and dr eam s  of 

lives  of the people who lived and died there.  They hid and bur ied a time caps ule underground, four  of 
thes e milk  c ans, thr ee of whic h wer e found. 
 
> > Sam  Ponc zak:  That's right.  This was  a ver y br ight historian he was .  He r ealized early on that what 
they are witnes s ing needs  to be saved.  They us ed the milk c ans  to pack  handwritten notes, letters , etc.  
I know there wer e four.  They found only thr ee after the war .  A fr iend of mine is  tr ans lating from Yiddis h 

into Polis h or fr om Hebrew to Polis h.  Sar a.  She is  wor king on the arc hive.

 a
t the place wher e he and his  
wife and his  s on, I think , were s hot.  They wer e hidden by a Polis h family in a bunker .  Ther e wer e 
about 30 people ther e that wer e hidden but s omebody denounc ed him.  So we were c
om m em or ating 
his  life and the job he has  done.  It was  a ver y nic e c er emony. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  In a m om ent I'm going to tur n back to Sam to c lose our  progr am .  I know if you
