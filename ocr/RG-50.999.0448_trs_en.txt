Estelle, welcome and thank you som uchf orbeing will ing to be 
our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
today.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: Thank you.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have just anhour. And you have som uch to share with us, so we'll get 
started right away.
 
 
You were just 10 years of age living inW arsaw, Poland, when 
W or ld W ar  I I b e gan afte r  
Germany's invasion of  Poland in September
 
1939.  Bef ore we turn to 
the war and tothe Holocaust and all thathappened to you and yourfam ily, let's startf irst with 

you telling us a little bit about yourf am ily andyourself  and your life and your com munity
 
before 
the war began. 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Iwas born inW arsaw, Poland. W arsaw was the center of m y universe.  
Inm y selective m em ory, gold and radiance, openblue skies, airf illed with f ragrance, rich 
sounds of goodneighbors, kindness andtrust and
 
l o ve
.  M
a gi c  
trainrides through the 
country
side during thesumm er later becam esheltered inm y m indf rom a world crum bling 
around m e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You've told me that,as yousaid, your magic train rides
, w
hen you said you 
think of that tim e, you think of loving neighbors. T ell usa littlebitmore of  what that life was like 

andabout your parents.  Tell usa littlebit about them .
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  It was a secure, loving hom e.  It was a world
 
--
 
I was ver y young
 
--
 
full of 
tru st.  It wa s m y wo
rld.  The trees were m y trees. T he sky was m y s ky.  Visits with fam ilies,

holiday.  Just paradise
.  P
articularly thedarker lifebecam e later. T he brighter, theperiod, the 
paradise of m y lif e 
shone.
  
 
 
I guess that we of ten valued thingsm oreat aloss in our 
m em ory than atthe mom ent that we experiencedthem because we take themfor granted as 
we take our tim e.  Andthat isthe way I think life shouldbe lived. W e should take our parents, 
ourf riends, our norm al life, kind lifefor granted but it often
 
gets interrupted. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we m ove to that interruption, andm ore thanthatby a long shot, you
 
--
f
rom  what I knowf romyou and whatI read inyour book, youare very close to yourf ather. T ell 
us just a little bit about him .
   
 
>> E s t e l l
e Laughlin: W ell,m y f ather was awonderful rolem odelfor m e.  He was a very kind, 
ver y accom plished person
 b
ut very m indf ulof other people.  I know that youof ten refer tothat 
exam ple that was during the ghetto, when there was a great hunger.  And I gave my sandwich 
away to hungry people. The streets were littered with homeless,dying, hungry peopl
e.   And  
m y m other, who was a ver y poetic person, loved beauty, loved humanity, toldme
:  
well, yo u  

should not have given your sandwich awa y because we don't
 
know if  there will be any f ood 
t o mo rro w.
  
My f ather,on theother hand, said
,  ﬁY
ou gave your sandwich a way; you did the 
right thing.  Look how hungry you are now.  Im aginehow hungry the child to whom  you gave 
your sandwich to was.
ﬂ
  
He taughtm e that stepping outside your own skin was essential to 
survi vin g with love and compassion and joyf ul light.  And he served as anexam ple like that 

throughout the war. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Estelle, Germ any invaded Poland, of course, 1939. W arsaw 
w
as attacked 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

that very 
day
.  W hat  do
 
yo u
 
remember on the attack on W arsaw and the long siege that 
occurred af ter that? W hat do 
you 
rem em ber in that very early part of the war? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Septem ber
 
1939 was the day like today.  My f ather lef t the house
 
--
 
m y 
fa the r w
as a jeweler.  He lef t thehouse to see his client.  He kissedus, lef t the house.  
Sometimes during theday there was a very explosion that made the earthtremble
; t
h en  a 
silencefollowed.  Itfelt like all the air was sucked outof  theuniverse
; a
nd  t he n
 scree ch in g 
sirens.  My m other turned on the radio and we heard that a bom b, acouple of bom bs, were 

dropped on W arsaw
 a
nd that we were at war, that Germ any bombedW arsaw without 
declaring war.
 
 
But even when thef irst bom b was dropped onW arsaw, the true 
brutality of  war seemed still unreal until that night.  That night
 
--
 
excuse me. Thatnight we 
were awakened by a trem endous rum ble of planes.  And bef ore I could lif tmy headf rom  my 
bed, the sky lit up brilliant lights, likef ireworks, and thenbom bs were dropped on us.  Andthe 
bombs were raining on us.  In one second I stopped being a child and took on the burden, the 
sad burden, of lif e. 
 
 
InsideI rem ained a child.  Iam glad to reportthatf rom m y 
experience children rem ain childrenatheart. Andthis is the wonderful and m agical thing 
about children. Even under the worst of  circum stances, when we played in bunkersand hid in 
alleywa ys, hiddenf rom the sky, hiddenf rom  the world, we still pretended, we still heldon to 
our inner
 
selves and the magic of  childhood. But there was still
 
--
 
while we rem ain children, 
children are alsoexcellentatm ultitasking. W e also looked out to see if there was a soldier, a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Na zi s o ld ie r,  in  
the neighborhood
,  
to protectthefam ily, to run homeandto warn
 
--
 
to hid
e 
contraband like books and bread.
 
 
So thatnight the sky opened up andbom bswere raining on our 
heads.
  
In spite of thefact that there was a lot of  talk about the threat against us in Poland and 
in spiteof all the horrid things that we heard happening with Nazi expansion, in spiteof  the fact 
thatthere were air raid drills, in spiteof  thefact that the city was strung with f lags and posters 
f lapping in theair, scream ing "
U
nited, 
Prepared, and R
eady!"  It still came as a total surprise.  
So bombs droppedall around us. T he buildings were crum bling.  Buildings were going up in 

f lam es. T here was not enoughf ood.T herewas not enough water.  TheGermanmilitary was 
so powerful that it swept through Poland in eight days.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said,f our weeks thiswent on.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: W arsaw held outfor am onth.  But you wrote in your bookthat once the siege 

was over and the Germ an Arm y marched intoW arsaw on October
 
1, 1939, you wrote, 
"I
mm ediately m y lif e changedbeyond im agination."  Tell usm oreabout that. 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Im mediately our lives changedbeyond recognition.  Our once peaceful 
streets were now patrolled by foreign soldiers.  They shouted hatredand content. T hey 
snapped whips inourhomes and
 
streets. T hey walked into ourhom es saying that we Jewish 
people were greedy.  But they walked intoour hom es like com mon thieves
 a
nd helped 
them selves to whatever they wanted. They rationedf ood. T hey turned off electric power. W e 
had no books.  Scho
ols were f orbidden. Books were f orbidden. They conf iscated radios.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

T hey conf iscatedall kinds of things and stoppednewspapers.  Sowe li ved in virtual darkness, 
cut offf rom  the world and from everything that was taking place. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I think
 
you toldm e that Jews were ordered to use whatever valuablesthey 
hadtopay for the war blam ing the Jews on starting this war. 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.  Now, I was a child
 b
ut evena child recognizes that the adult's 
ability f or cruelty and for
 
--
 f
or nonsense.  It was so ridiculous.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Evenas a child you saw that.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Yeah.  If  you lose trust, if  you'rea child and you losetrust inadult, you 

have toholdon to something.  So I guess Ibelieved thatthere is cruelty
 
in all of  us and there is 
kindness in all of us. 
 
W hat helped me to hold on, f ocus on the kindness, was m y com munity.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Estelle, tellus a little bitabout you had several cousins who f led to Russia.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
>> B ill B e n
son: T heywould f igure very im portantly later on in your lif e. T ell us a little bitabout 
t h em .
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: Well, the irony of  it was that there was noplacef or the Jewish people to 
run. T here was noplace to go.  And ironically, the Russians
 
were the ones who left the 
borders open
,  
so many peoplef led to Russia. Many of them ended up in Siberia
 b
ut they 
didn't lose their life.
 
>> Bill Benson: W emay hear more about them  later.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wouldn't be long before all the Jews inW arsaw that hadn't f led, which was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
the vastm ajority that hadn't, including your f am ily, would bef orced into what would become 
known as theW arsaw Ghetto. And you would be in therefor the next three years. T ell us 
about that life in theW arsaw Ghetto.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: Well, itdid not take very long before they built a thick wall aroundus.  Not 

only were we isolated, when the ghetto was established, it was aproblem bothfor the 
Christians and Jewish people inW arsaw.  Bec
ause the Christian people had to vacate the 
areas that were designated as the ghetto andf ind homes. And a very tiny part of
 
--
 
I believe it 
was 1/3 of the city was only af ew streets, was designatedfor 30%, I think
 
--
 
I'm  no t su re tha t I 
am  accurate
,  
bu
tI think 30%of  thepeople lived in3% of the area. 
 
W e had to pay f or building 
the wall.  
 
 
Can you imagine to be encircledby a wall, how your horizon is 
cut off? They called ita ghetto. T hey f illed the ghetto with Jewish people driven outf rom  
s u rro
unding areas. Most of them  cam eonfoot.  Many of them came without shoes, without a 
penny in their pockets.  Littletots in the street with b
a re
 
knees and b
a re
 
f eet cried and begged 
forf ood. There was not enoughfood. There was not enoughhousing.  People lived in such 
crowded conditions. People were dying of  hunger and starvation and the streets were littered 
with corpses.  Peoplecovered the children'sdead bodies with posters saying
,  " O
ur children 
are sacred.  Our children m ust live."  
 
 
But even in
 
this inf erno, the Jewish people inthe ghetto 
im mediately organized  them selves into self
-
help centers. Imm ediately ever y building
 
had a 
kitchen.  Every building had a com m ittee raising m oney and raisingfood and collecting clothes, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

doing whatever one could to help out their starving neighbors.  Guns hovering over our heads 
did not stoppeopleforcelebrating holidays. On Passover, in ourbuilding, there was Matzah in 
ever yone's house.
 
 
T o own a book was a capitalpunishment, a capital crime, capital 
puni
shm ent. Yet m yf ather, he was not the only one, had hadaf avorite stash of his booksby 
Yiddish wr iters, by Chaim  Kaplan and 
Shalom 
A sch  
inParis, nice wi ndows blinded with covers 
to keep our existence secret.
 
 
My f am ily sat ina dim ly lit room .  My f ather wouldpull out his 
booksand read to us.His voice was f lowing with s waddling comf ort.  Our home,our little 
home,felt likea capsule of paradise separating us f rom the deadly curfew, the quiet, outside 
our windows. 
 
 
W ehad hidden school.  Imagine the courageof  the teachers, 
unem ployedteachers,who were teaching children in cold room s tohold on to their inner self  

and their faith and good and right.
 
 
W eeven had theaters.  W hen we hadno bread. Imagine 
theaters when there was no bread.
 
>> B ill B e n
son:  All done in secret? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  All done under
 
--
 
it was def iant.  It was capital crim e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You quoted Chaim  Kaplan
. 

>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You know it better than I.  It's anamazing thing to think about those words.

>> Estelle Laughlin: Thank youfor rem inding m e of  it.  
C
haim  Kaplan was a remarkable 
historian. And he saidthat it is strange that when we don't seem  toneed it at all, we need 
p
oetry m ore than we need bread. 
 
Andthat is so true. W hen I was 11 years old or 12 years 
old, Ididnotappreciate yet the value of these things
,  
yet these wer e the things that keptm y 
s o u l a live
;  
that keptm y faith in humanity alive.  And that is what sustained me all throughout 
theatrocity and still it's within m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You wrote, yourself , in your book," It was am itzvah to dance in def iance to 
Nazi brutality."   Just say a little bit more.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: That was during the holidays. W eknew that celebrating holidays wa s 

t a kin g a  risk,  a
 
real risk, risking your life, yourfam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And am itzvah, doing a gooddeed.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  A m itzvah in Yiddish means a gooddeed. Sowe were just
 
--
 
we would 
just pull the window shades down and we wo uld celebrate the holidays
. 
 A
nd even then, 
considering this to be a m itzvah
, t
hat was our moral resistance. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather,as you've already said and indicated inseveral wa ys, thought 

participation inthe arts was im portant
 
evenunder those circum stances.  But your 
mother, you 
wrote, was focusedm ostly on practical ways to survi ve.  Say m ore about that and yourm om .
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  My m other scrubbed, washed, cleaned, pounded the pillows to air them  
out. She was ona ram page to keep the house so cleanof every
 
T yphus germ . T hat was her 
wa y of  protecting.
 
 
You see,m y m other

to it but throughouthistory Je wish people were persecuted andtheyalwa ys managed to hold 
on through books, through learning, hold on to their culturethroughbooks, through learning.  
 
 
Andm y m otherexperienced persecution also during 
W
orld 
W
ar  
I where she was driven out by the Cossacksf rom Shtetl, a little town in this Russia.  And it is 

possiblethat herexperienceduring that period when she was driven out and the cruelty of the 
Cossacks taught her as m uch about survival as the beauty of the country taught her to 
appreciatebeauty.  She would sing to us songs, anddescribetousthem eadowsf ull of wil d 
f lowers.  So she retained both.
  
And m os
t ofall, I am  proud that she retained that in spite of the 
cruelty that she suffered, she was a personfull of com passion. AndI'm  very proud of that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkwe'll hear even m ore about that as we m oveon to what happened af ter 
th a t.
  
D
uring that tim e,how did you managetof indf ood?  How were  you abletoeatand 
sustain life itself  during that period? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: Well, there was trem endous starvation intheghetto and people were 
dying by the thousands.  I already describedhow it was littered with dead people andhow 
f rightening it was to look at itas if for a child and to think thatperhaps it is going to happento 
u s, too . 
 
 
W e weref ortunate that our house remained in theareathat was 
designated asthe ghetto, so we still had our hom e.  And if you had your home, you hadpretty 
m u c h a  l ot .
  
M
y fatherwas also a jeweler.  And during the war, jewel ry becom esthe most 
stable currency. W hile there was starvation, there was the blackm arket. T he best sm ugglers 

in the ghetto were the children because they were sm all and were able to break through,

som etimes, through the wall and get to the other side.  And there were people on the other 
side.  Andthe Germ an, the Nazis, soldiers, were lining their pockets
 
--
 
there was a vigoro
u s 
black market. T he not normal became norm al during the war.  So thef act that we still had 

som e jewelr y and we lived in poverty but we did not starve
 b
ut there was trem endous 
starvation around us.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Nazis began deporting large num bers
 
in the concentration camps.  For a 
substantial periodof  tim e yourfam ily was able to remain hiddenf rom  that. T ell us whatthat 

invol ved, what your parents were abletodo to keep youf rom  beingdeportedduring that 
period. 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  In Jul
y 
1942, the monthof m y 13thbirthday, things becam eeven more 
gruesom e. T his was the beginning of  the infam ousW arsaw Ghetto deportation. Atf irst we 
hadno ideathat that deportationm eant that som e people, Jewish people, weref orced to wr ite 
false let
t e rs
 
--
 
excuse m e
 
--
 t
o write f alse letters tofamilies inviting them to join them  inplaces 
where they were f ed and sheltered. But, of  course, it was a lie.
  
 
 
As a result,m any people, destitute people, hom elesspeople, 
hungry people who had very l ittle
 
options went to march

1942, 99% of the Jewish children disappeared.  Can you imagine aworld without the sound of  
children
, w
it h
out the presence of grandmothers and grandfathers because childrenand old 
people were thef irst ones to disappear?  
 
 
W enever heardf rom  the people who were yanked away f rom 
our lives.  But some ofthe
 
people came backandthey told
 
us aboutthis horrif
ic  t ra in  ride  
t o 
T reblinka
.  Can you imagine?  People have mothersandf athers, children, taking mothers and 
children andpeopleand shoving them  into oven andturning them into ashes? 
 
 
W hen thatbecame known, the Jewish people began to organize 
them selve
s anarmed resistance.  Butby then the ghetto was like a hum ungous cemetery.  
T here was such silence.  There was such quiet. The windows, you looked into the windows, it 
was like looking into gouged outeyes
, n
othing beyond them.  T he quiet, you couldfe
e l it  c ra wl 
at you.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had written, as youm entioned, 99% of the children were taken. At som e 
pointthe Nazis declared that any personunder 14 was uselessto them .  You were 13.  How 
did your parents react to that?
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: 
 
Children under 14 were contraband because they were considered 
unproductive.  I was 13.  I had braids.  My mother cut offm y hair. Shedressed me into adult 
clothes.  Iasked m yf ather, you know, I said,"
D
ad, what if  theyf indout that I am  only 13?"  
A
ndm y father said, "W ell, I will never let them take youaway f rom me.  I'll burn their eyes out." 
Y
ou know, I knew better, but Ibelieved him
; t
hat I was saf e
 
if
 
only in his love.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint during thatperiod your fam ily m oved to a ground level

apartm ent.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was all a very deliberate plan on your parents' part. T ell us whatthat 
m eant.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  As I mentioned
 
--
 
I don'trem em ber if  Im entioned
 
i t .   B ut  s om e p eo p l e 
wh o  we
re  s
ent to 
T reb lin
ka managed som ehow to hide under corpses.  Som ehow they 
m anaged to getback to theWarsaw Ghetto, toT reblinka. W hen this becam e known, the 

Jewish peopleprepared themselves for resistanceand they startedto build bunkers. And the 
bunk
ers were underthe buildings.  
 
 
W a rs a w was  a
n  
ancient city.  Most people lived inapartm ent 
buildings. T here were ver y f ew private homes. W e were theonly fam ily in our building still 
alive.  So we m oved to the groundf loor.
  
My father was am em ber of the resistance, and we 
hada bunker, too.  Our bunkerhad a secret trap door, all bunkers did. T here was a network of  

bunkers built throughout portionsof  the ghetto that wasf or entrenchm ent andfor hiding.  
 
 
Also, the resistancefighters dug tunnels to 
leave f rom  one 
bunker to thenext.  And they dug tunnels underneath the wall.  And they also used s
ewersa 
lot to get arm sf rom  the Christian resistance,f rom  thepartisans.
 
 
So we had thisbunker
 
--
 
the entrance to ourbunker was a 
secret trap door, which
 
was the powder room , comm ode.  Itall lifted.  Then you walked down a 
lit t le  la d de r.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Under the commode.

>> Estelle Laughlin:  So this was tobe
 
--
 
thissm all basem ent was to beour universe, our 
world, netherland.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you, of course, there in theW arsaw Ghetto when the rem arkableuprising 
occurred. And then, of course,the subsequent, just horrif ic obliteration of the ghetto.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatcaused
 
the actual uprising
?
  
W hat  wa s  t h e eve n
t that precipitated the 
uprising? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: Well, there were a couple of skirm ishes
 i
n early 1943 between a few 
partisansand the Nazi forces. As a result,topunish the Jewish people f or a coupleof  

skirm ishes, Hitler was prom ised to cleanse
 
all of W arsaw, of  the rest of  the Jewish people. As 
a present to Hitler, a cleansed
 
--
 
W arsaw cleansed
 
--
 
a ghetto cleanse of  Jews within three 
days.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was to be a birthday gif t.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  A birthday gif t.  Right.  Events erupted with Nazi soldiers com ing into 
W arsaw with warplanes, with tanks, with thearm ored cars rolling down the streets and cars 
with hum ungousm egaphones announcing we all were to
 
reportfor resettlem ent or else they 
were going to tear usapart.  
 
 
O
f course, we disobeyed. W e lifted our trapdoor and stepped 
down the ladder into a n
ether
wo r l d
, p
ulled the trap doordown.  Thewalls closed in onm e. 
T he ceiling pressed down on m e. T hef lickering of  the 
carbide
 
lightwas our substitute for the 
sun.  T
heticking of  the clock was our only connection with the outside world.  T hat was the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
18
 
only clue we had when m orning was rising, when sun wasf alling.  How I craved forthe open 
horizon,f or the sky,f or theblue crispnessof day.  Thefew people in the bunker with us were 
our whole nation.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And while you were there,of course, this terribleuprising, conf lict, going on 

above you. T ellus about that.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  So while we were in thebunkerf ighting erupted above us.  Im aginea 

g
roup of poorly fed,poorly arm ed resistancefighters facing a 20th Century Arm y, armedf rom  
head to toe, lots of bom berplanes, tanks.The resistancef ighterssteppedout inf ront of the 

tanks, crawled through the tunnels, crawled through the sewers, step
p ed  u p o n t op  of  r o of  
tops, inf ront of open windows and lobbed Molotov cocktails andf ire throwers, whatever they 
had in thef ighting against thisArm y.
 
 
T he  r em a r k a
ble thing about itand the noteworthy thing about it 
is th a t it too k
 
Poland
 
and France lesstim e tocapitulate than it took the resistancef ighters to 
f ighteven af ter Hitler declared the ghetto cleansedof  Jews.  T he ghetto was bled white. The 

resistance f ighters f or weeks and weeks and m onths, the f orm idable skirm ishes, they were 
hiding in the ruinsbecausethe ghetto was obliterated.
  
 
At som epoint a grenade was thrown atour trap door.  
Apparently they knew
 
--
 
the Nazis somehow had som e knowledge about som eof  theplaces 
people were hiding. They threw a grenade. At thatpointthere was nota corner we couldhide 

anym ore. And they dragged us out into the street. Buildings were crum bling toourfeet. The 
sky wa s b la ck

sky was black with bomber planes. Thebuildings crum bling toourfeet.

Flam es, enorm ousf lam es, licking the sky and

T he air was trembling with explosions.  The ground

people in congealed blood.  I tried to 
yank m y head away.  I couldn't understand whatdeath was.  My biggest wish was that I would 
m a k e t he  t r an s i t i
onholding on tom y parents'hands andm y sister. T hey m arched us to 
Um schlagplatz.  
 
 
In the m orning, m y m other, m y sister and I m iraculously 
survi ved. W e survi ved with com passion, with love for hum anity andwith joy f or lif e. W e 

survi ved where the crem atory was, where the chim neys were spitting out smoke, smelling of  
humanf lesh, where our f riends' bodies weredangling where they countedus daily.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid you last see yourfather?
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: The last time I saw m y father was in Majdanek.  Men, wom en, and 
children were tornaway f romone another. There were very f ew chil dren, butthey were kept in 
a small, enclosed area
 y
am m ering, calling
,  "M
am ma,"  "
T
ata."   My father was sitting separate 
with the men
o
n themuddy ground. My
 
sister, m y m other andI were sitting opposite them en.  
T his is where we were gathered, were guarded by guards.  My father pushed himself  to be in 
thef ront row so
 
thathe could seeus. Our eyes
 
were locked.
 
 
My f ather was very il l at that point with TB.
  
He  wa s b rittle .  I 
couldnot stand the suffering I saw in his eyes.  I was so usedto looking into hisfacefor 
c o mf o rt
, f
or steadiness,f or reassurance. W hen Inoticed that the guards weren't watching, I 
dashed across thef ield and knelt inf rontof m y
 
f ather.  And I said," Tata, don't worry aboutm e; 
you know they won't getm e."  AndIf lipped the lapel of m y coat and showed him,

W e had capsules of

we used as a last resort.  Andm y f ather looked 
at m e and he said,

on'tuse it.  Youm ust live.
ﬂ
  
And that was the last tim e I saw 
m y f ather. 
 
 
By som ef lukeof  circum stances,m y m other,m y sister and I 
were sent toother camps
,  
to a slave labor cam p.
 
 
You know, I'm  very aware of sharing such very personal th
in g s .   
And I am  just so grateful when I look aroundandI see the kindf aces of  all of  you. I appreciate 
it so much.  I wantto kind of justif y why I am  sharing such cruelties and express so much I 
appreciate your intensef aces. Because I'm doing it, and
 
I think you're doing it, becausewe 
need to be rem inded of  the crueltiesthat human beings are capableof. And maybe in the 

m om ent that we perceive that cruelty we areso muchm ore aware of the im portance of love.  
T his is why I feel that Ineed to justif y and rationalize.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Estelle, you and your mother and your sister
,  
F r edk a
,  
would remain in 
Majdanekf or about threem onthsdoing slave labor
 a
ndthatf rom  there you would bef orced to 
yet another cam ptoalso do forced labor.
 
>> Estelle Lau

over so m uch thatoccurred in that three
-
m ont h  pe r i o d
 a
ndthe brutality there was 
unimaginable
, b
ut youwould go f rom  there on to another camp. W hat was that like? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  It's a slight 
d is t in c t ion
 
orm aybe not sucha slight distinction between 
exterm ination cam p and slave labor camp. Though I was told thatMajdanekfor some reason 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

is not termedan exterm ination camp, I call itan exterm ination cam p becauseeveryone I knew 
inW arsaw was gassed there.  Andany
 
placethathasanexterm ination oven in its place and 
uses theovens to kill people tom e is an exterm ination camp.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, they took your father right aw
a y.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.  And Skarzysko, also in Poland, was a slave labor cam p. T hey 

were m anufacturing arm s forthe Nazis.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usm ore
 
--
 
I'm going to interrupt you. W hen you were onthe 
train going f rom  Majdanek to
 
Skarzysko, if  I rem ember correctly, the train stoppedand an 
event occurred that really you thinkm ay have saved your lives.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin: Well, how did one survive?  It was random  luck.  If  99%of  childrenare 
scooped up, it's just like when you
 
--
 
nom atter how well you s weep,there will be som e crum bs 
t h a t  will b e  le
f t.   So  t hat  i s  t h e r a n dom  l u c k , bu t
 
there was alsoaf eistiness. In this situation, it 
was random  luck.  
 
 
W hen we were on the trains f rom Majdanek to Skarzysko, m y 
sister had to goto thebathroom . T he train stopped once. W e were perm itted to goto the 
p it  
st o p
. Andm y m otherandI pleaded with m y sister notto gobecause the soldiers were 
standing outside and shooting, just shooting justf or 
the f un, just for the fun of  it; no
t 
because 
they had to, justfor the fun.  Butm y sister just absolutely hadto go.So we went out.  
 
 
W enever separated. W e were like oneorganism . Love 
sustained us.  Oneof  the things that kept usalive was thefact thatwe had one another.And 

th a t 
was very rare.  As far as I know, m y m other was the only m other in the entire cam p, to the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

22
 
bestof m y knowledge.  Most people were com pletely alone. W e were the only f am ily, that I 
know of, of three people.
 
 
So the when it was time to gobackto thetrain, we went to a 
different car.
 
>> Bill Benson:  By accident.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  By accident because they were shooting. W ewere running.  And when 
we arri ved in Skarzysko, there were three branches in the concentration camp.  One was 
where they were m anufacturing gunpowder.  And thepeople who went to thatbranch that 
m anuf actured
 
the gunpowder
,  
imm ediately their lungs and their skin, they didn'tuseany m ask, 
any precautionand sothey looked so ghoulish.  Not only were 
they 
skeletal so mostof  them 
d ie
d.  And 
had 
we stayed on thattrain
, 
we would have endedup in thatbranch.  Butbecause 
we didn't, we ended up in another branch. W e were sorting amm unition.
 
 
Skarzysko, while it was a slave labor camp, it was still encircled 
by electrif ied barbed wiredf encing. T here were still towers.  T herewere still guards therewith 

beam s of lightf ollowing ever y step we took. W ehardly ever saw a flower, hardly ever sa w a 
bird or abutterf ly, hardly e ver saw the sun.W e workedfor many, m any hours.  Andm ost 
peo
ple died thereof  hunger and cold. It was terrible.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's Skarzysko.  I know our tim e is running short. There's m uch morefor 

you to tellus, but there's a coupleof  things Iwant you to share with us.
  
It was at Skarzysk o 
where you, Fredka, your sister and your mother, were referred to by your otherfellow inmates
 -
- y
ou were ref erredtoas the threem onkeys.

>> Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were actually going to use that in the titleof  your book.  Explain that. 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  My
 
--
 
of  course, I leave out som any details. If  you readm y book, youwi ll 
se e  
--
 
you will f ind thedetails.  You will also f ind the courage andthe love that shines through 
human beings even in the darkest places. 
 
 
My sister had T yphus in the cam p.  Idescribe in m y book how 
m y sister was isolated in the hospital andhow m y m other would trade her
 
--
 
the slab of bread 
to try to helpm y sister.  My sister did survi ve.  They shaved her hair. My sister used to be so 
beautif ul
 w
hen she
 
was a child.  And inthe camp she lookedawf ul. Her hair was shaved. Her 
eyes were sunken. Her cheeks were sunken.  She was like a walking skeleton.  And we were 

theonly fam ily of  three.  Also, we recovered with lice andm ange. And we looked like 
m on
keys.  So we would cuddle togetherandpick lice.  So the people in our barracks 
aff ectionately called us
,  " O
h, here are the three monkeys."
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the summ er of 1944, youwere f orced again tomove and this tim e to a 

concentration cam p known as Czestochowa.  Tell us a little bitabout that because that would 
then lead, eventually, a long time off to your liberation.  But tell us alittle bit about that.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:  Czestochowa was very m uch
 
--
 
was also anam munition factory, also 
owne
d by a Germ anf irm .  It was ver y m uch like Skarzysko.  T henam iracle
, i
n January
 
1945 
we hear a rum ble of planesfollowed by bom bardment.  W e lif tour headsand we say, " C
ou ld  it  
be
 a
fter allof  these years?"   And the bombardm ent. 
 
 
W e were so isolated. 
 
W ehad no idea that only a few rabbit

hopsaway f rom us people were sailing on silver lakes, children were sitting aroundtableswith 
theirf am ilies. W ehad no idea if the allies were winning or losing.  And here we hear the 
rum ble of planes andwe hear the bom bardm ent. W esay, oh, please,don't stop. W edon't 
care if  we die.  Dying by an allied bomb would be suchanhonorabledeath.  We were on that 
road. W ell, we were liberated at the crackof dawn.  And liberation,I assure you, was nothing 
lik e  yo u
 
are likely to imagine.  And,of  course, tim edoes not allow me totalk about it.
 
>> Bill Benson: T akea moment, though
,  
todescribe when you realized that you were 
liberated, even if  it wasn't them om ent we like to think of and go
, "
A
ha, I'm  liberated
," b
ut tell us 
what happened. 
 
>> E s t e l l e  
Laughlin: W hat happened was the gatesof  paradise opened.  As I described to 
you, all we had was a
 
--
 
no underwear no gloves, no sweaters.
 
>> Bill Benson: T his was an especially brutalwinter.  Right?
 

>> Estelle Laughlin:  Poland
 
--
 
it was them iddle of January, and Poland ispretty cold. It was
 
--
 
yeah, especially when you don'thave propercoverage and woodenclogs. W e shuff ledout of  

the camp when we realized, the whole night 
--
 
how the liberationoccurred is ju
stto o mu ch fo r 
m eto describe.  But we shuffled out passedthe electrif ied wires, outsidef ence, ano
-
man's 
land. Nothingm oved. Nothing stirred.W e shuff led through. W ekeepon going. Then we 
hear tanksand we hear voices of  soldiers. And 
t
h e n,  of  
course, we were af raid
.  W h
at  if  the s e  
are Germ an soldiers? But then we hear they are Russian soldiers.So we run to them
 
t
eary
-
eyed, like m essiahs
,  ﬁD
o you know how long we've been waiting f or you? 
 
Nobody heard our cries.  Nobody heard ourpleas.  Here
 
you are.
ﬂ
  
And the soldiers putup a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
25
 
hand and said, 
ﬁS
orry, we have a war to fight.
ﬂ 
 
And, indeed, they did have a war tof ight.  And they looked at 
their watches andthey said, 
ﬁY
oubetter be caref ul and f ind shelter bef ore curf ew.
ﬂ
  
A t  th a t 
point I don'
t know if  I was more af raid of dying of  cold and starvationthan being arrestedfor 
breaking the curf ew
 
an
d being put intoprison again.  
 
 
And we were so hungry.  W e went out into the streets.  People 
looked atus. I want to believe there were people who
 
looked at us with s ym pathy, but there 
were no DP cam ps, no help at all.  But we encountered some peoplef rom  the camp who told 
us down the street there is afactory, a picklefactory.  So we clim bed through the window. And 
ourf irst meal was adill pickl
e.
 
 
And you know?  Inm y m em ory, I think that som ebody offeredus 
herring, pickled herring.  And Idon't know if  itwas wishf ul thinking or if  it really happened. 
 
 
So we did a lotof  wandering afterthe war.  A large part of m y 
book isdedicated to the story of  liberationbecause very little was written about it,particularly 
liberation in the Russian sectors because they were not as generous.  And also, they were  not 
as econom ically able.  And also there was Stalin.  Idon't think we were very im portantto them.
 
But eventually we cam e tothe United States.

I don't know that Ibelieve

her then,but obviously I

so
 
I wanted tohear it.  And my m other was right.  Now all over Germ any people 
are asking, how could it have happened? I
 
am  so gratef ulfor that. I am  ever so gratefulf or 
that.  Ifeel that guilt and revenge is not the issue. If eel the responsibility is to understand. 
And I think that we areleft with all of us
 
--
 
all of us are lef t with a legacy to understand how 
coul
dpeople do that. W eare all humanbeings. W eall share something. 
  
As long aspeople 
are saying that the Holocaust never happened, we have to question, we have to understand
 
if  
civi li zation is tom ake any progress.
