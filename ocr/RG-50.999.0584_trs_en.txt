W ebegin with this portrait of  Fanny 
and her daughter
,  
Josiane
,  
taken in 1942
. 
Fanny 
was born on Decem ber
 
3, 1916, in Lodz, Poland
. 
She was the second of three daughters born 
to Benjam in Orenbach and Rivke LeahAspisOrenbach.
 
 
Soon af ter her young sister Rose's birth in 1921, theOrenbachsmoved with their 
daughters,T erese, Fanny, and Rose, toBrussels, Belgium
. 
On this m ap of  Belgium  the arrow

Fanny graduatedf rom college where she studied dressm aking anddesign
. 
W hile  
workin g as a dressm aker for the Royal House, Fanny met Jacques Aizenberg
. 
On May
 
19, 
1938, Fanny and Jacques were m arried
. 
Here we see their wedding portrait.
 
 
One year later, on March 21, 1939, Fanny gave birth to Josiane
. 
T he f ollowing year, 
on May
 
10, 1940, Germ any invaded Belgium
. 
This picture of Jacques, Fanny and Josiane was 
taken in 1941.
 
 
In 1942, Germ any began the roundupof  Belgian Jews
. 
Fanny arranged tohide 
Josiane in a Carm elite Convent
. 
For security r easons, Fanny was not told whereher daughter 
was hidden
. 
This photo of  Josiane was taken in 
1941.
 
 
In Brussels, Fanny wor ked for the underground
. 
In 1943, she was denounced and 
sent to the Malines transit cam p in Belgium and then toAuschwitz
. 
T he arrow on this map 
points to Auschwitz.
 
 
Here we see adocument recently uncovered in the International T racing Service 
archive listing Fanny on the transport listf rom Malines to Auschwit z
. 
She is listed as No.119, 
about a thirddown the page
. 
Her profession of  seam stress is listed in French on the right
-
hand 
side.
 
 
Here we see Fanny's daughter
,  
Josiane
,  
being recognized f or Fanny's work in the 
Belgian Resistance
. 
This photo was taken in the fall of 1944 afterBelgium  was liberated but 
bef ore Fanny was liber ated.
 
         
 
Fanny lives in them etropolitanW ashington,D.C. area.She and her husband Jacque
s

daughter, Josiane, lives nearher and is retiredf rom  her work as a social worker f orabused 

children. Josiane and her husband,Alf redT raum, are also Holocaust survi vors. Fanny has 

three grandchildren from  Josiand Freddy and I'd like to pointoutthat Josi is here us in the 

f ron t  row.
 
         
On Sundays, you will find Fanny at theMuseum 's Donor's Desk answering questions. 

Fanny's volunteer work at this museum has
 
included translating docum entsf rom  Frenchto 
English. For exam ple, she translated a bookabout thedeportationof  Belgian Jews written by a 

non
-
Jewish teacherf rom  the Holocaust. Fanny has spoken at several sem inars about the 
Holocaust including this m useum 's eventto comm em orate theanniversary of  the liberationof  

A u sch wit z.   

 
Fanny started and was an active
 m
em ber of the Yiddish Club at a senior citizens 
center that meets twice weekly
. 
She is alsoa sculptor.I don'tthinkFanny wil l m indm e sharing 
wi
th you that she celebrated her 100th birthday this past December.
 
         
 
W ith that, I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Fanny Aizenberg. 
 
>> 
[Applause]
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Fanny, we are so glad you are here with us today and willing 
to spend an hour 
with us telling us what you went through
. 
And today we're f ocusing on what you experienced, 
you and yourfam ily
. 
W e don't have a lot of tim e but letm e start with m yf irst question, Fanny.
 
T ell us about your early life when yourf am ily m ov
ed f rom  pollen to Brussels
. 
You explained to 
m ethat your early year s you had a wonderfullif e
. 
Tell usabout thatwonderful life. 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
The reason it was a wonderful lif e isbecause we were young, innocent, 
and very believing
. 
And we were also ver y, very luck y that our parents cared
. 
T he reason wh y 
we lef t Polandf rom  that time where we were all born we don't know
. 
But we know one thing, 
that we took
 
--
 
we wer e encouraged by m y father andm other
. 
Myf ather happened to be aver y 

3 
 
educated pers
on
. 
Andhis job was to workf or the Jewish com munity m ainly organizing the 
synagogue.
 
 
Andat thattime, it was a very sm all country
. 
T hey were supposed to remainaf ree 
country, not to be occupied, f ree like Swit zerl and
. 
W e didn't know a lot ofthings at 
tha t time
. 
Not only because wewere young but we were ver y innocent
. 
Andwe had parents who had 
encouraged us to goalittle bitfurther than just the daily news and just high school, which we 
a ll d id .
 
 
Belgium  is a small country but a wonderful country
. 
E
ducation isf ree of  charge
. 
I don't 
k n o w if  it  is  s t ill to d a y
. 
If  you were good, till thefif th grade, that means you were intelligent 
enough tounderstandthe pages were you just turning or what youwere learning, then you 

could continueanother grade and
 
after that another grade
. 
 
 
Andm ost of us, we were very, ver y luck y that we f inished collegebecausemy parents 
andm any otherparents would nothave them onetary ability of supporting college because 

college in Belgium was just as costly as here in Am er
ic a
. 
And even in Belgium, if a student 
was not goodenough to get an education,they had to learna tradewhich means that they 

would be able to be without the welf are
. 
Belgium does not have
 
--
 
they have a system  but they 
don'thave one thing, as of  today.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Beforethe war began in Europe in1939, youf inished college
, y
ou went to 
wo r k
, y
ou got married
a
nd you gave birthtoa child
. 
During that tim eHitler consolidatedhis 
power and Kristallnacht happened, the Nightof  Broken Glass
. 
T e ll us  
about that time as you 
were starting your lif e while Hitler is becom ing to power, Nazis are gaining power
. 
W ar hadn't 
begun yet
. 
W hat  wa s  y o u r lif e  lik e
? 
Tell us about m eeting Jacques and getting m arried
. 
T e ll u s  
what your lif e was like.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
It was ver y easy f or young people to meet other young people, especially 
if  they were a musician and he was.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
He was a musician.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Yes, andhasa trade somehow.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Tell us about your f uture husband being a mu
s ic ia n
. 
W hat d i d h e d o?  
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
One,hem adea living by playing in the movie houses
. 
Don't forget, you 
are soeducated and so knowledgeable,
 
now you don'tneed that
. 
Now you have autom atic 
m usic with the movie.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
This was the 
s ile n t f ilm s
. 
He was a m usician at the silent f ilm s
. 
Righ t ?  
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Five m usicians were playing in one movie house but they hadtoplay 
according to whatthem ovie was
. 
Butnow it's a different world
, l
ike so many things have 
changed for all o
f  youyoung people.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And whenthe talkies came in, Jacques lost his job
. 
Righ t ?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Not only Jacques
, e
verybody who was in the m usic industry
. 
The sam e 
thing as histeacher who was also already head of m usicdepartm ent
, h
e  lo st  h is  job .
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W hatdid Jacques do then?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Jacques went to night schooland learned to be a tailor
. 
Andhe worked a 
lo t
. 
You hadto know aprof ession
. 
You couldnot just go and say I'm going to be a tailor or I'm  
going to be something and do it
. 
You hadto go to school
. 
And you had to have proof that you 
did go to school and that you learned it.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You and Jacques got married in 1938,and the next year, March21,1939,78 
years ago, you had your baby Josiane.
 
>> F
anny Aizenberg
: 
Righ t .
 

4 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
At thattim e, March 1939, thewar would begin afew m onths later
. 
Do you 
recall whether you wer e f earful about thefuture when you were gi vin g birth to Josiane? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W e we r e s c a r e d t o dea th
. 
There's no
 
word to describe it
. 
But we we re 
af raid to talk am ongst ourselves
. 
W e were so sure thatBelgiumand Holland wouldbe such a 
peacef ul country and peaceful people that the war would never happen or they wouldn't let it.
 
Noneof  us, not evenour big politicians, knew thepower of  the Germans
. 
 
 
Believe it or not, as of today I'm talking to you, Germany does not recognize that they 
were the ones who started the war
. 
And they have been killing m any, many people.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Goback to thattim e just
 
a little bit, you graduated f rom  college.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Y e s. 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You got your Bachelor's degree indress design
. 
And then you gota very 
prestigious job
. 
Tell uswhat you did.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ell, each one of  us
 
--
 
there were groups
 
chosen
, t
hat made the whole 
group
, t
hat m ade the whole outf it
. 
W e hadto know what kind of party they were going to go, 
how m any people were going to be, is itm orning, noon,evening
. 
I t wa s  ve r y, ve r y,  ve r y we l l  
organized
. 
Andeveryt hing was quiet.
 
>> B i
ll Benson
: 
And you were workin g f or theRoyal f am ily
. 
Righ t ?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: C
an you 
believe it
? 
But they were the same people like anybody else.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
They were?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
The only thing is what we people
 
--
 
we lost because we didn't get Social 
Security
. 
Now I started Social Security andI get
 
$5 6  of
 
$5 9
. 
For three years we didn't get 
m oney. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Germany and the Soviet Union invadedPoland in Septem ber
 
1939 to start 
W or ld  W ar  I I
. 
Eightm onths later the Nazis invaded Belgium andT he Netherlandsand the low 
countries
. 
W hat was your life like, as you recall it, during that tim e? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Scared to death.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Scared to death
. 
O k.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Because many peopleat that particular time were able
 
t o e s c ap e  f rom  
Austria andBelgium had an open door
. 
And that's what happened.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And atthattim e in May, I think, of 1940, whenthe Nazis were com ing, there 
was a call for mento join the m ilitary.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
That's correct.
 
>> B i l
l Benson
: 
Tell uswhat Jacques did.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ell, notonly m y late husbandbut every young personf rom any other 
country, they were able toescapebecausef rom Belgium  there wasa way to go to England
. 
T hat was the main point.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
He  lef t
. 
He was planning to join the Britishm ilitary, ri ght?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
They did.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
He  d id.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
They did.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W henhe left, whenhe left you, he respondedto the call to join them ilitary
. 
On ce  h e  left, d
id you know what happened to him ?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Nobody did.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Nobody did? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Because apparently even before theGermans invaded Belgium  they had 
already spies and checking
. 
And they had made a request
. 
W hatever the Germ ans wanted, it 

5 
 
was not adem and, it was a request
. 
You had to
 
--
 
or you go to work
. 
You still don't know which 
one you wouldbe.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W henJacques lef t, you didn't know what happenedto him
. 
And now you're 
alone with Josiane
. 
Wh
atdid you do
 
t he n?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
I had no problem
. 
There was a daycare
. 
She wentevery day to daycare
. 
Andbesides that,daycare was responsible
. 
They were also checking, according to theage of  
thebaby, what kindof  m edicine, what kind ofvitam ins
. 
W e were som uch ahead of time where 
the daycare is
, m
uch,m uch, becausem ore young wom en went either to schoolor to work, but 
m ostly went to school.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You shared with m e that once the Nazis were in power in Belgium, conditions 
got worse and worse very quickl y, especially f or Jews
. 
One of the things that you shared wi th 
m e is that there was asystem of  clinicsfor mothersand babies in Belgium that you hadaccess 
to but oneof  thef irst restrictions im posed was to cut off Jewish wom en and ba
bies f rom  those 

c lin ic s .
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
C o rre c t
. 
That's right.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W hatdid that meanf or you?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
It m eantall of the Jewish people
. 
But thenagain, as soon as the 
Germ ans occupied Belgium, thef irst restriction we had is 
conf iscate our radio
. 
Like the 
newspapers today orwherever you got thenews, it's so diff icultforyoung people to 

understand that you can or you have or you must live without the radio
. 
And we didn't have the 
radio until m y latehusband lef t. 
 
>> B ill B e
nson
: 
During thattim e, you still hadyour m other andfather
. 
W hat were your parents 
doing atthat time?
 

>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ell, they were still
 
--
 
hadbeen paid to work in the synagogue
. 
A n d  m y 
m other was always helping somebody else
. 
And there were many organizations which wer e 
depending on som ebody else
. 
W e were notwealthy people but wealwa ys had our house 
open. 
 
 
Can you believe it
? 
Atthattim e, which is not that so many years ago, we were thef irst 
people who had a record player.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Y
ou were thef irst with a record player.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
In abig, big neighborhood.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You lived in your apartm ent with Josiane until 1942.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Y e s. 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Tell us when the deportations started
. 
Do you rem ember whe
n that happened?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
The deportations started ver y, ver y strangel y, also becausethe Germans 
or Nazis, whatever you want to call them , they knows who they are, and inGermany, of  

course, they were able to organize to get thechildren
. 
T h is  
way they couldtake the parents
. 
But the children, theywere sending them  toHolland andBelgium .
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Once the deportations began, Fanny, you made thisextraordinary decision to 
put your daughter, Josiane
 
--
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
It tooka long
 -- 
how could a singlem other with a childof
 
--
 
very happy 
s in gin g
. 
She didn't talk but she started to sing
. 
And it was wonderful
. 
How do you put the child 
away? 
T hat's theonly thing I had
. 
I had nothing else
. 
And thatdecision is still bugging m e 
badly today, would I try or wouldn't Itry
. 
Because thepeople who took careof  any child they 
tookf rom a home, wewere not allowed to know where that child isgoing to be put in case we 

are getting c
aught
. 
T hen we def initely, in order to save
 
--
 

6 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
So you had no idea where Josi was.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W e were not allowed
. 
It's not because they didn't want to tellus. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Righ t .
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
And today I still think maybe I should andm aybe I shouldn't
. 
But she's 
alive today, thank
 
G od
. 
But younever know
. 
At thatparticular tim e, especially as small 
country
. 
Number one,we were not allowed to go to schoolanym ore
. 
I lostm y job not because 
the queendidn't wantm e or didn't likem eanym ore but Jewish people were not allowed to 
wo r k
 
f or non
-
Jewish people
. 
Even as servants they were not allowed to work
. 
T h is wa s such  
an easy wa y to m ake us less and less in number without being abletof unction
. 
A teacher was 
notallowed to teach anym ore, so there was no salary
. 
So you could im agine ho
w fewer and 
fewer f am ilies having to live in this situation
. 
And the scareof  the Germ ans was unbelievable.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W it h Jo s i in  
hiding, somewhere you didn't know, Jacques gone, youdidn't 
know where he was, you then joined the Belgium  resistance.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
I think m ost of  us.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Tell usabout what it was like to be partof  the resistance.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
I think it was unbelievable because it kept your m indf rom  the daily 
business and the daily pain andthe daily hunger.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W hatdid you do in the resistance?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ell, we all went down
. 
W e all had a job.
 
 
Can you believe,5
-
year
-
old boys were the leaders of the underground
. 
T hey were the 
ones, because they we re so innocent looking, they were able to do
 
--
 
display like newspapers 
which we didn't getanym ore
. 
It's undescribable.
 
 
T he m ore
 
--
 
I wouldn't say
 
--
 
it's constant in our m ind
. 
And theolderI'm  getting, it's 
aching, like taking your soul away.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You told me oneof the things you did was go outatnight and put anti
-
N a zi  
posters up.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
That's correct.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
That had to be very dangerous.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Of co u rse it wa s
. 
Not only because it was, but next to the signs youwere 
tryin g to put
 
--
 
ther
e was a sign that said if you caught som ebody, they are going to be shot on 
the spot, which they were.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And som ehow or another,fora while, you were safeandabletodo that.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Righ t .
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W here were you hiding?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W e were hiding in som any different places
. 
Any kind person whowas 
wi lling to openthe door and sharea slice of bread with a Jewish person inhiding, and there 

were m any.
 
 
And I want you all to know, it is undescribable and unbelieva
b le
. 
Belgium  is theonly 
country that today we have 4,000 Jewish people who arealive thanks to the churches
. 
And 
don'tforget, the churches were in danger
. 
Because whenthe Nazis cam e toa church andthey 
said we want the Jewis h children because we're going to take them on a vacation, Mother 

Superior said, well, you have to com eback in two days because we have to see if  we can 

clothes for them
. 
AndMother Superior was about maybe two feet tall.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
That's theamazing thing
. 
I
t 's so  in
credible what people were wi lling
 
--
 
I 
say were wi lling
. 
Nobody was forced.
 

7 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Fanny, you were in hiding, your m other was in hiding, your t wo sisters were in 
hiding in that tim e.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Y e s. 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W here was your
 
fa the r
? 
W hat happened to him? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
My f ather, sincehe was working f or the synagogue
 
--
 
and Jewish people 
were not allowed to be buried
. 
So all of that had to be done in hiding, which it was
. 
And that 
was al ways done atnight at the rabbi's house
. 
T hat's where they had the ritual.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Yourf ather was taken away?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Ye s
. 
B ut  he  wa s  c
aught
 
ve r y,  very,  ve r ye a r l y
. 
And then they hada 
ca m p
. 
It is now am useum
. 
And what the Nazis did
 
--
 
they still had Nazis working
. 
T hey 
showed the tom b
. 
Nobody hadever gone out alive.
 
 
T hey have today a m useum and they showed the tom b and how they were using to 
torture those people
. 
And they were killin g the Jewish m en
. 
And in thatm useum there's like a 
record player and it tells you
 
what they did and how they did it.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
In1943, you and your mother were both denounced and you were taken and 
arrestedby the Gestapo
. 
T ell usaboutthe arrest and whathappened to you.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ell, thearrest is very scary
. 
T hey
 
scare you
. 
Because themain thing 
thatthey were hurting us or hitting us is on thef ace
. 
T hey def orm ed us and then
 
--
 
th at's wh a t 
they toldus, we wouldn't be usedfor anything.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Did you know who denounced you
? 
Did you know who denounced y
ou? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
No
. 
W e still don't know today
. 
Andm any, I wouldn't say prom inent 
people, but very active  people
 
--
 
when I say active people, people who were involved of 
helping either or theother
 
--
 
don'tf orget, it was alsoam atter of supply am munition tothe 
people who were hiding because
 
--
 
so both sides in casethey would bediscovered.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Af ter you were taken to the Gestapo headquarters,from  there you were sent to 
a cam p called Ma
line s
. 
W hat kind of aplacewas that? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
It was a camp, organizing people wherethey should be sent
. 
And 
ever ybody who was sent to any cam p,they would send in carsused for anim als
. 
So we were 
all covered up
. 
W e were 116 people and we go
t to A u sc
h wi t z  
three nights andfourdays later
. 
40 people cam e out alive.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Out of  the 116.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: Of 
t he  11 6
. 
There wasone wagon they were able to have over 200 
people
. 
So them ore people they had inthose
 
--
 
I don't know how you called it
 
--
 
the less that 
c a m e o ut
. 
But itdidn'tm atter to the Germ ans because it would be less elim inationand less 
people put through the gas cham bers.
 
 
T hat's another thing
. 
W ehave learned so many things we didn't know before, like gas 
chambers
. 
And I'm sure when Im eet peoplewho com eto visit them useum , they hadn't heard 
about gas chambers either
. 
Andthank God they haven't
. 
T hat's what's so am azing today
. 
A 
week ago
 
--
 
there's adelegationf rom Americaf rom  this im positionwho go to Germ any an
d  s t ill 
try to have some people recognized, thatover six m illion Jews have been killed andthey still 
are discovering m oreand m oredead bodies in Poland, underground, that they didn'thave tim e 

to  ge t ye t.
 

>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You told me you don'thave the words to describe what Auschwitz was like
. 
T o 
theextent you can, tell us a little bitabout what it was likef or you when you wentto Auschwit z, 

what it was like once you got there.
 

8 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
There's no words
. 
T here's sm arter people than I am  and
 
m any of them 
are muchm ore educated butnobody hasfound a word.
 
 
How could a norm alhum an being, any kindof education, could invent that innine 
m inutes on the clock 100 people were dead
? 
T hey hada regim en of Nazis going around those 
dead bodiesand ma
kin g su re
. 
T hat's why we  don't have goldanymore
. 
All the goldhad been 
taken outf rom  anybody who went to Auschwi tz or any of the cam psbecause the goldthey 
collectedf rom the bodies, on the train, orany transportation 
--
 
themain transportation was 
t ra
ins because they still used the trains.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W henyou got to Auschwitz, you were selected to do slave labor.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
C o rre c t .
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W hatwas the laborthat youwere f orced to do?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Either the kitchenon the grounds
. 
Butourm ain job was to work in the 
amm unition factory
. 
Because we were dying m uch f aster than we woulddie at another job
. 
Faster than we woulddie working on [Inaudible]
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Because the work in the amm unitionfactory was so dangero
u s. 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
From  the sm oke andfum es
. 
That's why when we were liberated, we 
didn't have nails anymore
. 
And we didn't have the colorof  theeyes.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
From  the chem icals.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
That's correct
. 
And we had to work 20 hours
 
a  sh ift.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You shared with m e that you were gi ven a tattooednumber when you gotto 
Auschwitz, not once but twice.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Righ t
. 
And both are the sam e.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Explain that to us.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
I can't because they
 
wer e too stupid
. 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
I ' m  s o rry
. 
I didn't mean it that way.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Sothey had given you
 
--
 
f irst they gave you a num ber that they had tattooed 
on som ebody else, sothen they had to tattooyou again.
 
>> Fanny Aizenber
g
: 
I have two numbers
. 
And what they have done at them useum  here, 
shows m any survi vors because we havem ore thanone num ber or two or three
. 
T hat was their 
pride because they had invented that
. 
Nobody had num bers
, e
xcept cattle
. 
T hat'swhy we all 
had num b
e rs
. 
T hey com mended their invention on itsnum bers
. 
 
 
W hat we are so grateful, that the HolocaustMuseum  has decided,in order 
to
 
--
 
whatever they said they would do tous,they ask, can we see your number
? 
I don't show 
m y number either.
 
So they have a room and they show a num ber of numbers which has been 
done in camp
. 
So the visitors don't have to see that andthey see that peoplehad beenhurt by 
having a num berbecause normal people, people living in any country, they never had a 

number.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
I know this is very difficult to talk about
. 
I'm going toask you if you would say 
anything about thefact that medicalexperim ents were conducted on you at Auschwitz.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
This is what the reporters f rom America hadfound last week
. 
T hey ha
d 
m adem edical experimentationonbabies, believe it or not
. 
T he most 
experim entations had 
been doneto young wom en under the age of 20.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And you were oneof  them .
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Yeah, I think I justm ade thedeadline. 
 

9 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Fanny, you shared with m e
 
--
 
what you said is it was notdone by hoodlum s
. 
T he experimentation was doneby ver y educatedpeople.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
They hadtobe educated to lookand dothis kind of surgery on all of us
. 
And some were younger than I was.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And you told me that you were not perm itted to scream .
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
You couldn't scream
. 
T hat's way to be killed
. 
And that'sa good excuse to 
b e  k ille d
. 
Or if  killing was notf ast enough, they had leather whips and 10 of those andt
hen you 
were gone.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
In January
 
1945, as theallies were advancing, theGerm ansforced youand 
others who were still alive to go ona Death March before you were liberated.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Righ t
. 
You would know
. 
He made them ap ofGerm any
. 
I wanted to know 
where we went.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Did am ap of  where you went on your Death March?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Oh, yes, every cit y and every country.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
So it was f or about four m onths.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Y e s. 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W hat  ha p
pened on the DeathMarch
. 
How did 
you 
survi ve that?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
I would say 90%
. 
T hat's wh y it was called theDeath March.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Because almosteverybody di ed.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Most of us, because it was ver y heavy snow and very, ver y 
c o ld
. 
A nd  n ot  
only that, we hadn't eatenfor two years by then
. 
So it was very tough to remain.
 
And six of  us, because we had stuck together, in good and inbad,mostly bad.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You becam e very close to those otherf ive, likef am ily.
 
>> Fanny A
izenberg
: 
Yeah
. 
W e played together
. 
Even apiece of bread,or a peelof  a potato 
was shared am ongst the six of  us.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Af ter the Death March, you were still alive, you were  taken to 
Ravensbruck
. 
W hat wa s  i t ?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
It was a concentration cam p which was already em pty because the 
Russians were too close.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And that was a cam pmostly for wom en
. 
Righ t ?  
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Righ t
. 
Only wom en.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You were liberated in April
 
1945
. 
Tell usabout your liberation.
 
>
> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ell, them ain thing, we couldn't walk anym ore or we couldn't talk 
anym ore
. 
W e were not hum ans anym ore
. 
And we justf ell down
. 
Being snow it would have 
been very easy to have disappeared, like many have been discovered now or much later 
e ve n
. 
And we were ver y lucky because it was the last battle they had a victory
. 
 
 
Believe it or not, I had a hard time to believe it
 
--
 
do you know that the Russians, 
because they had beenfightingf or so long and so muchand they had lost som any of their
 
population, they were the f irst nation who had signed the liberty to the Americanpapers.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You were liberatedby the Russians. 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
The Russians helped us because we were not
 
--
 
they were wil ling to 
share what they had.
 
 
First of all, they cleaned usup
. 
Can you im agine
 a
fter so many m onths of  marching 
and not eating
? 
I don'tknow what would have killed usm ore
. 
Many of  the young wom en died 
because their body couldn'thold
 
fo od , e
specially the ones liberatedby the Am ericans or the 

10
 
 
E n glis h
. 
They had wonderf ulfood, we were told
. 
Andm any had died
. 
A cousin of ours lost his 
sist e r
, t
he only one who ha
d  
rem ainedalive because her body could notabsorb thefood.
 
 
W e we r e l u c k y
. 
They didn't have anything
. 
So what they did,they used to stealf rom  a 
farm a horse or two and go toanotherfarm and steal a cow
. 
But we got the sam eamount as 
other people
. 
And we were reall y treated ashumanbeings which we hadn'tbeenfor such a 
long tim e.
 
>
> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Af ter the war ended, you found your daughter
,  Jo sian e ,  
and then you were 
reunited with your husband
, 
Jacques
. 
W ill you tell us about that,how that happened? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
That's such a diff icult em otion
. 
First of a ll,m y siste r, sh e  
was in the 
undergroundfor so long, she got her apartment
. 
And the only thing 
she could do was get the 
iron co
ts. 
So shehad her own food
, m
y only si ster.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And all of  them  were in hiding as well
. 
Righ t ?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Oh, yeah
. 
A ls o  in 
a church
. 
Her three sons were in a church
. 
And 
rem ained alive.
 
 
B u t an ywa y, it's
 
--
  
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Your sister is the one who was abletof ind Josiane,right? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Ye s
. 
Because through the underground
. 
There was no problem
. 
In many 
corner
s of the different streetsthere was a list of  eachtown a person was f rom
. 
So a nam e 
was on that piece of paper
. 
Soanybody passing had a chanceof f inding somebody.
 
 
T hem ost interesting thing
 
--
 
and Idon't know if my daughter recognized m eor not
. 
B u t 
what she did, at night she used to come to m y cotand used to tie a knot in her night gown 
andm ine soI wouldn't run away anym ore
. 
But it took her a while till she had realized.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W henBelgium , I believe, was liberated, inthef all of1944, so your sisters and 
Josiane, they were all liberatedm any monthsbef ore you were.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Oh , su re.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
They had no idea where youwere.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Nobody had
. 
T hey wer e not allowed to
. 
Otherwise m aybe somebody 
would be looking for us.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
How did 
you 
make itbacktoBrussels after your liberation?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ith the Red Cross
. 
No problem
. 
T hey were wonderful people
. 
And they 
were also people
 
--
 
they brought us back where we com ef rom
. 
T hat's how they wound up at 
m y sist e r's
. 
She'sthe only one who had an extra cot.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
So you were reunited with your sisters and Josiane in the spring of 1945.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Righ t .
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And atthattim e, again, you still did not know what happened to Jacques
. 
H o w 
did youf ind out about Jacques?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Because his position
 
--
 
they got hit by a bombver y badly
. 
And he worked 
for two years in a hospital in England
. 
Butnobody knew where those peoplehad gone
. 
I  gu e ss 
ever ybody was running and trying tof inda hiding placeor aplacepeople would open thedoor 
fo r th em .
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W henwas it that youf inally were reunited with Jacques
? 
He spenttwo years in 
the hospital.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
It was the beginning of 1946 because it was already two years af terthe 
hospital. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
So it took until 1946 bef ore yourf am ily was back together.
 

11
 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
And Ihad a very hard tim e
. 
I was in the hospital in Belgium
, a
fter when 
we cam e to Am erica,also.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W hi
chhappened in 1949
. 
W hy did it takef rom 1946, 
‚
45,until 1949 to come to 
the United States?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Because it took three years to geta visa perm it.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Once you arrived in the United Statesas imm igrants, share with us what it 
wa s  
like for you here
. 
How did you get established
? 
Ho w d id
 
yo u
 
f ind ways to earn your living? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ell,  it  wa s  ve ry d if f icult
. 
The reason why it was difficult, number one, in 
order to apply f oran Am erican citizen, you had to know how to 
s p eak  E n gl i s h
. 
So we went to 
night school
. 
It was very, ver y diff icult.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
W hatdid your sisters do afterthe war? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
My older sister's husband and shef inally got together with the three 
sons
. 
T hey hadm edical problems
. 
W e 
all had medicalproblem s
. 
But besides that, I think we 
m ade it withf lying colors as hum an beings
, a
s civil i zed hum an beings, I could say
. 
I don't know 
any better.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
E xa c t ly  righ t .
 
 
Fanny, what is it like f or you to talkabout theHolocaust?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
I didn't.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You didn't?

It's wonderf ul
. 
I'm  volunteering here

You have the right

>> 
Hi
. 
So you said that you didn't know the locationof  your daughter
. 
How were you reuni
t ed  
with her
? 
How was that organized?
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
The question was
 
--
 b
ecauseyou didn't know where Josiane was hidden, when 
you were able to reunite with her
 
--
 
well, your sister is the one whof oundher
. 
De s c ribe  ho w 
your sister was able tofind Josi
ane.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
No problem
. 
My childwas brought to m y sister
 b
ecausethey knew m y 
sister and herhusband and the restof  thefam ily
. 
So they knew she would be in goodhands.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And your sister was also with theunderground.
 
>> Fanny 
Aizenberg
: 
That's correct
. 
T hat's why they had
 
--
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And the underground placedJosi so they knew whe re she was
. 
T ha t ' s  ho w  
they were able to bring them together.
 
 
W ere you, Fanny
 
--
 
wh en you cam e back, were you surprised tof ind Josi?
 
>> F a n n
y Aizenberg
: 
I was surprised to be apersonor to be alive
. 
And I think I had lost alot of  
m y softness andm any of the others
. 
And stilltoday it's very diff icultm any times to be back as 
a person. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
And you are
. 
You've got af an club here
. 
Everybody knows you as this 
extraordinary hum an being in every wa y
. 
W eare so glad you'rehere.
 
 
Let's see if  we have som em ore questions
. 
T here we have one right there. 
 
>> 
You said that you had gotten really close with f ive other ladiesduring your Deat
h  Ma rch
. 
Are you still
 
--
 
were you able to stay in contact with them af ter you were liberated
f
or any 
am ount of  time? 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
The question, Fanny, you wer e so close to the otherf ive wom enatAuschwitz 
andthen on the DeathMarch
; a
f ter the war were you able to stay intouch with those wom en? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W ith some
. 
T hey were m uch older than I was
. 
Andthey were deported 
m uch earlier than I was
. 
That made abig difference
. 
Justa day or an hour in Auschwitz m ade 
a difference 
of  a lif etime.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
But you were able to stay in touch.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
Yes, but they were m uch older and diedm uchearlier
. 
I don't know wh y 
I'm  still around here.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Because you needto be andwe're glad.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
: 
W
hy? 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
To dowhat you're doing today
. 
T hat'sone of many good reasons.
 
 
Do we have another question? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg
:

>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
You want to show your picture

Forfolks who would like a closer look,when we're done, you'll
