2001 in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side
 
A. What is your full name? 
Answer: My full name? Alfred Schnog. 
Q: And when were you born
, and where were you born? 
A: I was born in Cologne, Germany on January 25
th
, 1931. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit about your fam
ily. How long had they 
been in Germany? 
How m -- how many genera
tions back can you go? 
A: Well, I know for a fact that the
 
Schnogs lived in the regi
on in Germany, in the 
Cologne region for several 
hundred years back. How Œ ho
w far back, I think probably 
somewhere in the 1700™s is 
how far we™ve been able to 
trace them. I don™t know the 
exact date and we don™t know ex actly th e lineage, who Œ whose parents they were, 

but the family goes back at least 
that far, and probably longer.  
Q: What a Œ what about 
your mother™s family? 
A: My mother™s family lived 
in Germany, wa Œ i-in the 
region just near Poland. We 
don™t know very mu ch about them. I know onl
y that her grandparents were there, and 
her parents and of course sh
e was. She didn™t know too 
mu ch of the history beyond 
that, because her parents died 
when she was a young woman.

Q: Who made up your family, do yo
u Œ did you have
 any siblings? 
A: Yes, I had a sibling, an Œ a twin brot
her. There were just th
e two of us in our 
immed i ate  family .  
Q: What was your father™s name?  
A: My father™s name was Lu
dwig , my  brother™s name was
 
Norb ert
 
an d  my  mo th er™s 
name was
 
Margaret.
 
Q: What kind of wo rk 
did your father do? 
A: My father was in a trading business 
in me tals and mi nerals, and during th e 
important years that I™m concerned with in  Germany, he was work ing for a large 

international trading organization. The na
me was Œ or the person who had fo unded 
the business, it was named
 
Lisauer(ph).
 
And they had offices in
 
Cologne as well as in 
some cities overseas, over Œ ov
erseas to Germany anyway. 
Q: Did your mother work? 

A: My moth er was employed 
early in her life as a secret
ary. When she married  my 
father she stopped work ing and raised a fami
ly, so she was generally a housewife, but 
she worked for many years as a secretary. 

Q: Did you have a large extended family in 
Cologne or in other parts of the country? 
A: We had family, we had certainly, uncl
es and aunts. My grandparents lived in 
Colo gne, in a suburb of Cologne. Deutz wa
s the name of the su
burb and they  owned

a house there and we were frequently over th
ere, obviously. I loved my  gran dparents, 
we were very close and Œ 
Q: These are your paternal grandparents? 
A: Paternal grandparents. My maternal gr
andparents had died lo ng, long before I was 
born, and the only memb er of that fami ly 
that I rememb er was 
my mother™s sister, 
who was about 10 years older th
an she was. She lived in 
Berlin at the time and we 
went to visit them, but only once and I reme
mber that visit very well, I was quite 
young, mu st have been, oh perhaps four years 
old or five years old at the oldest and it 
was an interesting visit because as youngste
rs the two of us was very Œ were very  
excited to go to Berlin. We went there a
nd wh en we walked to th e house they  had a 
little dog, and it was a Spitz, I think, terrie
r. A nd you opened the 
dog and the Œ door 
and the dog jumped up on us a
nd we were frightened to deat
h, a fear that I had until I 
got my  own dogs some many years later. Bu
t that™s the only recollection I have of 
my matern al relatives. 

Q: A-And th eir names were? 
A: Let me see. 

Q: It™s okay. 
A: I may not Œ I Œ I should know this. 
Q: Well, we™ll come b ack to it, that™s okay. 

A: Probably remember it later.

Q: Yeah. Let™s talk a little bit about y
our family itself. Was it a very Œ your 
immediate family, was it a very re
ligious family, or a secular? 
A: That™s an interesting question. As fa
r as I know, we were secular. My Œ my 
grandparents, my  grandfather was not terri
bly religious, but my  grandmother was, 
she was quite observant. My aunt, my father™s
 sister, her name was Selma, was also, I 
think, religious. She Œ she was a spinster 
and lived with my gr
an Œ my father™s 
parents. My Œ my  mo th er kept a kosher ho
me and as they  have told me that during 
the Hitler years they became more involved 
with religion than th
ey had been before 
because they were s Œ ostracized by the 
German community and therefore drew 
closer to the Jewish community and there 
was sort of a Œ a renaissance of religion 
during th at period of time amongst Jews and 
they were a part of that. Were they Œ 
and my  mother would not have
 kept a kosher home if it we
ren™t for my grandparents. 
She did that for them and for 
Œ for my  father and then  of
 course, we were brought up 
in that fashion until we came 
to the United States much la
ter, which time all that was 
Œ well, I wouldn™t say all of that was droppe
d, I think for a few Œ a few years here I 
had religious education, and then we sort
 of drifted away from the formality of 
religion, and religion not a terribl
y important thing in our lives. 
Q: Do you reme mb er any specific holiday
s as a Œ in your early childhood in 
Germany? Any memo ries of those? 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

A: Oh yes, I reme mb er very vividly go
ing to temp le on Simchas Torah, and th e 
temple is C onservative Orth
odox, you know, where of co
urse, the women sat upstairs 
in the balcony and th e men were worshipp
ing downstairs and as children we were 
with the men, as boys. And I remember 
that holiday so  well because during th e 
service, the mothers would 
thro w candy down  from the balcony, and my  brother and 
I did everything we could to gather up as mu
ch of it as we could. It was a delight, and 

I remember it 
very fondly. 
Q: What about home ritual, did you 
observe the Sh abbat or Passover? 

A: Yes, we observed Sh abbat and it was a 
kosher f Œ kosher house, and certainly 

observed the Passover. And fo
r any child, of course, Ha
nukkah was the m Œ was a 
major holiday and that was always celebrate
d. And one of the things that I do also 
reme mb er, going to  my  gran dparents™ home, 
they lived in a Œ wh at I could best 
describe as a Œ looked  like a browns Œ wh
at a brownstone would lo ok like today. 
They  lived on th e lower floors 
and there was a yard in the 
back, rectangular yard. It 
was walled in on three sides, but at the ho
use. And in that little yard, which was just 

delightful, there was a Œ always a sukkah. 
So  on th e holiday of 
Su kkos we would go 
there and I would marvel at all th e interes
tin g things that were 
hung from the sukkah  
and the Œ and th en we went to temp le from 
there, and so those were my  recollections 

really, of the holidays.

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood or were there Œ was it 
mixed? 

A: I would say i-it -- w h ere we lived it was 
mixed, very , very mu ch  so mixed. My 
grandparents Œ Deutz was the Œ where they
 lived was a Œ for I guess going back 
many hundreds of years mu st have been ki
nd of a ghetto for Jews, a Jewish Œ a 
Jewish area. I -- I don™t think it™s a ghetto 
in  the commo n sense today, but it was an 
area that was populated mostly by Jews, 
and the synagogue with Œ the Co logne 
synagogue was there, the Œ one 
of the major ones was right in that area, very near by. 
So they were more Œ in a Œ in
 a mo re Jewish area and my  parents and we lived in Œ in 
a mo re mo dern area of Œ of Co logne. 
Q: What Œ what str
eet did you live on? 
A: I remember it very well, it Œ the name
 of the street was the univeri(ph) Œ 
Universität strasse, University
 street. And we had an  apar
tment on either the first or 
second floor, I don™t quite recall whether i 
Œ whether it was right on Œ no, it was on 
the ground floor, I™m sure of that. And acro
ss the street w as a very large park, and Œ 
which was very interesting for my brother 
and I. We would look out of the window 
on Œ particularly on weekends and all kind
s of interesting th ings happened. Ho t air 
balloons would be Œ would be launched  fro
m there, and of course there were a 
multitude of parades, with military music and 
the Œ and the Nazi yo
uth and all of that, 
which was for a child at least,
 an eye opener, interesting to
 see. We never really were

a part of that, as you would 
understand, but we could see it all going on. It was quite 
colorful, and Œ and in teresting. 
Q: You were obviously quite young then. Di
d it mean anything to
 you to see these 
Nazi parades with these flags and uniforms? 
Or what did it mean to you as a young Œ 
very young child? 

A: Well, we were pretty well indoctrinated as to what the N
azis were doing. Our 
parents did not keep any secr
ets from us. And we were Œ it was there, we felt totally 
apart from it. We felt as though we were
 not welcome to join it. This was for 
Germans and that Jews were not welcome in thes
e Œ in these circles, or at least in this 
crowd. And although we looked on it with
 interest, and possibly as a child with 
longing to be a part of something, we knew 
that it was beyond us to be able to be a 
part of it. Just wasn™t possible, and did we
 feel ostracized by it? I don™t think so , not 
in that way. I think my feelings were that it 
would be nice if we c
ould be a part of all 
of this, but no, it was Œ it was not Œ it was 
not to be and there was too mu ch fear 
attendant to trying to  be a part 
of that. We knew we wo uldn™t Œ  
Q: Because? 

A: We knew  we wouldn™t be welcome. 
Q: How did you know? 
A: Well, we had any numb er of personalized
 experiences in that Œ this was a time 
when  we started school, and we were Œ we
 went to a Jewish school, which I think 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001

wa-was already at that time forbidden for Jews
 to go to the public schools or to the Œ 
to other schools, we had to be in  sepa
rate schools. And in  those schools, walking 
home from school, we were often chased by 
Nazi youth. We made it our business to 
stay out of their way as mu ch as we coul
d because we knew that they would taunt us 
as we went from school back to home. But 
it didn™t happen all that frequently, just, 
you know, once Œ oh, it™s so di
fficult for me to rememb er how often, but it did Œ it Œ 
all that has to do is happen
 once and you rememb er it, as 
a child. And we did, we just 
Œ my  brother and I learned ho
w to run very fast and we 
ran. We went Œ ran home, 
and that was that, wh
en they bother us. 
Q: You Œ you used the expr
ession Germans a nd Jews. Did you not feel German in 
any way? 

A: I didn™t have a sense of nationality, not at  that age. I kn-knew 
we lived in Œ in the 
country that we lived in, which was Germany,
 Deutschland, that was our country, but 
my association was that we were really not 
a part of it because of our Jewishness. My 
parents I don™t think had that feeling so  mu
ch. They felt themselv
es as being German. 
And Œ but they made it clear to us how unw
elcome the Jews were and I Œ there were 
other incidents that I can relate to you wh
ere I was Œ where I recall how they tried to 
d Œ to keep Jews out. So , did I feel Germ
an? I knew I was there, I had no sense of 
nationality, I was perhaps too young to have
 that sense of nationality. I do know that 

I was very much interested in geography
. My  parents spoke often of America and 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

that was very interesting for us. You know,
 where is America and what is happening 
there, and why is it so great, 
and Œ because th ey made it so
und very, very interesting, 
etcetera. And then we learned ab Œ all abou
t Œ my father was Œ tr-traveled a lot. So 
when  he was abroad and he Œ all those ye
ars, even during the Nazi period, he was 
traveling in Great Britain and in Holland and 
he told us about his 
trips. And this was 
all very fascinating for us. So, we were in Œ 
I never really had a Œ 
you Œ to get back to 
your original question, I ne
ver had a sense of nationality
 at the time. Fascinating 
interest with the world and different co
untries, but no sense of nationalism. 
Q: What language di
d you speak at home? 
A: We spoke German. That wa
s the only language that we  knew. Just to step back, 
which gives you an idea of the Œ the way 
I became aware of being a Jew, and how 
unwelcome we really were, not just from wh
at my  parents said, but you would go to 
shops or look, and you would see si
gns in the store windows, Jews 
ungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. And you 
felt strange going in to those shops, 
although shopkeepers often didn™t care. Th
ey Œ they welcomed 
you because they Œ 
you were after all, a client, you were goi
ng to spend some money an d they would 
happily sell you things. But the signs, neve
rtheless were in the 
windows and in  the 
doors. One in particular I th
ink goes back. We used to go
 to a beach on the Rhine and 
my mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself therequite frequently during the 
summers and we would enjoy ba
thing in the Rhine. I want
ed to learn how to swim. 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

The interesting thing is how th ey taught sw
imming in those days, 
they put the student 
on a long string attached to its waist and on  a pole and just held them there in the 
water so that they™d learn 
how to swim. We were too yo
ung for th at, but we had the 
wish to learn how and be a part of that. An
yway, we™d go to the 
Œ to the beach quite 
frequently , and it was a lot of fun. Kids love
 that, and we loved 
it. Then one day we 

went and there was a sign, Juden ungerw ur
nscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw 
the sign and my  mo ther pointed  it out to us 
and sh e went to the proprietor of that 
beach and se Œ and said, what does this 
mean? I mean, w e™ve b
een coming here for 
years. Oh, oh, no, it Œ she said, this doesn
™t apply to you, yo
u can Œ you can come, 
but you know, we have to ha
ve these signs. So although 
we Œ we went, the comfort 
level of going th ere suddenly went down se
veral s Œ degrees Œ mo re than several 

degrees, quite a lot and we learned at a 
young age that we were some how different, 
that because we were Jews, we were not pa
rt of the general public in Œ in Germany. 
We learned it also when we took trips with 
my  parents on weekends to go to  Œ th -the 
Rhin eland has got many, many interesting hi
storical sit es and castl es etce tera, which 

children love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no 

Jews allowed. We sometimes ig nored thos
e signs and so metimes it was a little too 
uncomfortable and we just we
nt Œ did not go th ere, or my
 parents chose not to go 
there. Perhaps they knew wh ere they were serious about
 not having Jews and wh ere 
they weren™t. The Rhinela
nd overall was not Œ I don™t 
think the people in the 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

Rhineland were all that much
 in love with the Hitler er
a, that administration, and 
many of them did not agree with what was 
going on. But nevertheless, they had to 
live their lives and th ey did wh at they we
re to ld, as all good Germans did in  those 
days, but still found ways to tolerate theJews who lived amongst them. Except for a 
few. Obviously there were always those 
who were rabid Nazis and who you had to 
stay out of their way of and Œ and for me 
as a child, particularly
 the Œ the youngsters 
who were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see 
Jews to at least taunt them, if not phys ically assault them. I don™t rememb er ever 
being physically assaulted, but we did lead 
fairly normal lives as
 children, aside from 
this discrimination. My brother and I used 
to Œ we found our way to the circus once. 
When  we were supposed to be co ming hom
e from school we got on a train and we 
wanted th e circus so badly we hopped aboa
rd a streetcar and went out to the circus. 
And of co urse my  mo ther was beside hers
elf, why didn't the bo
ys come home? But 
those are the kinds of events I think that  mo st children do. You could do this and 
there was no fear that somebody would harm
 you and take you away or steal you, or 
what have you. You could Œ 
we Œ we felt no danger in doing those things. Perhaps 
my  parents were concerned, but my  brother 
and I were not. Then  of course, things 
got a little bit more dicey and Œ 

Q: Okay, we Œ we™ll get to that in a minut
e. Talking ab out you 
and your brother, how 
would you describe yourse
lf? Were you a Œ it sounds like you were a little

12
independent child there. W-Were you, or 
were you different from your brother, or 
how would you charact
erize each of you? 
A: Well we were Œ we were close as youngst
ers, so we did everything together and 
when we had a desire to do something, at
 least we had somebody to do it with. So, 
we were adventuresome. I don™t think that 
we were abnormally risqué. We did the 
things we wanted to , but we also hewed 
to  being home and Œ and doing our studies 
and listening to the things that
 we needed to , listen to our parents, and when  they said 
ja Œ do your homework, we did our homework
 and all those things. So we were not 
wild, as such, but we had our moments when
 we wanted to go 
out and have some 
fun, and we did.  
Q: Were you an athletic ch
ild? A physically strong ch ild? 
A: N-Not at that age, we were too young. At
hletics didn™t mean very mu ch at age six, 
seven, or five. Four, five, six, seven. [inaudible] 
Q: I meant you weren't Œ you weren™t frail. 
A: No, no, no, by no means. 
I think we were rather norma
l in man y  ways. One of the 
things that I remember those Œ those year
s, w as that it w as always difficult for my 
parents to get all the th ings they needed in  the store. Things were in short supply, 
particularly things like milk, eggs, all 
kinds of foodstuffs. Germany was not well 
supplied in those things and there were al
ways shortages and of
 course we depended 
on the goodwill of the Christian shopkeepers, 
or the German shop
keepers and they Œ 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

as I said before, there were always those 
who made it their business to help out and 
we found that Œ my mother always found 
means to bring in wh
at we needed to 
subsist on and all Œ of
ten Œ I-I don™t remember us starving, I don™t remember us 
having any difficulty in Œ in getting th e th
ings, the substance that we need Œ the 
subsistence things that we needed . I do kno
w, I reme mb er my  mo th er talk in g  abo u t  
how har -- difficult it was to get these thi
ngs, and there was one event that I guess 
epitomizes, that we went Œ we were going to
 go to  my  grandparents in Deutz and we 
Œ my father loaded us in 
the car and he had gotten Œ ap
parently in Œ in Deutz my 
grandparents couldn™t get all the food that 
they  wanted and he had gotten some fresh 
eggs, wh ich were also in very short supply,
 he got them in our area, or through his 
friends there. And we had set off and shortly
, I think, before or after we got to the 
bridge that goes across the Rhine to Deutz,
 a Œ another car sides Œ hit us from the 
side. It was a major blow and I wound up 
with a cut on my  leg and wound up in  the 
hospital, my mother wound up
 in the hospital with a cut on her scalp. And th e only 
ones who really got free from it Œ  Norbert 
also wound up with 
something, but not 
very much. My father was not
 injured. But during the tim
e, he was so concerned Œ 
you know how nervous one ge
ts when something like that happens, his first thought 
was oh my  gosh, the eggs. And he picked 
them up and he put them in his pocket. 
And of co urse they were all smashed in hi
s pocket. But that gives you the idea of 
how scarce these foodstuffs were
, that he wo uld think of th at in a m Œ in a mo me nt of 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
14
panic or trau ma, to save those eggs to ge
t them to the grandp
arents, which was the 
important thing. And we wound up in  the hosp
ital at that time, in a Catholic hospital, 
and it was Passover, and I remember the Œ the 
nuns in wh ite habit and also in black 
habit coming, taking care of us and they we
re very, very nice, we had a doctor, an-
and I need ed  some stitches in my  leg a
nd it was all done. When  they brought up the 
food, of course, it Œ I didn™t want to eat
 it. It was Passover, we were taught th at 
Passover has to be kosher and it has to be ma tzoh etcetera, so I s Œ spoke up and I 
said that to the nuns, and th ey underst
ood it comp letely and to ok care of us and 
brought us what we Œ what 
we would need  for that. I do think th at the religious 
institutions, the hospitals, the Catholic 
church recognized, 
at least fro m that 
experience, recognized mo re that there were
 customs that other Œ others hewed to, 
and they  respected that. I think they respected any type of religi
on, as long as it was 
religion. And so  I™ve Œ I did not feel that 
we were badly cared 
for because we were 
Jews, it was Œ certainly didn -- didn™t 
have that feeling at that time. 
Q: You said you saw signs, no Jews allowed. 
What does that mean to a six year old, 
seven year old that knows how 
to read? Ho-how did Œ how Œ 
A: Well, it Œ it means that you are someho
w an underclass. You are not part of 
society as a whole, you are not seen as ev
erybody else. You ask 
yourself the question 
why, but there™s no answer. 
And you ask your pa
rents, and the parents say your Œ 
you™re Jewish. They explain to you a little 
bit of the history a
nd of the pogroms and 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

15
of the many things that Jews have been 
Œ how Œ how often they
™ve been the Œ the 
object of a pogrom or of discrimi nation ev
erywhere, and that was in Germany. You 
know, there was a Œ there was always an 
undercurrent of anti-Semitism in Germany, 
that predated Hitler. So Œ and as a Œ as a 
Jew, you Œ what is 
Œ a Jewish child, you 
were made aware of that when you were ve
ry young. I™d like to 
comp are it today, for 
instance in United States where you have, if
 you were a black, you would know from 
when you were very young, that you are 
different than the white community, and 
your parents would tell you about the discri
mination, the things they went thro ugh. 

This is the way we were. We
 knew this when  we were y
oung, and so when  we saw 
the signs on the wall, it was just an affirm
ation of exactly wh at we already knew  or 
what our parents had already told  
us. They  certainly didn™t hide it.

ou were talking about a child
™s perception and how you 

knew you were different. 
A: We Œ y-yes. We certainly were differe

years that times were changing. We knew that
 laws or regulations had been  enacted, 
or had been prom

Q: How did you know, as a child? 
A: My parents told us. They
 were very open. We had a 
household that was Œ they 
kept noth ing from us. They  assured us of ou
r security and we relied on them for that, 
and believed that, but they also
 told  us wh at was happening.
 They  told us of many of 
the people who had been persecuted who we
re Jews, who Œ and th ere was a lot of 
persecution, there were people who lost th
eir jobs because they couldn™t Œ couldn™t 
work any longer. Jews were not allowed to
 have Gentile maids in their homes. All 
these things happened and we 
were Œ we either saw it an d we were Œ or they were Œ 

we were told about those things. And I re
member as a y o ungster my father kept a 
revolver. And of course this
 was very exciting for two young boys, we always 
wanted to see the revolver, and my  father show
ed it to us but he never let us touch it, 
which was terrible, we wanted to  get our 
hands on it. But one day we took our car 
and we were visiting our grandparents acr
oss the Rhin e and my  father took th at 
revolver with him and he stop
ped in the middle of the br
idge on th e Rhin e river. And 
he took it apart and he started throwing pi
eces of the gun into the Rhine, one after 
another. And of course we were curious, w
hy? And we learned th
at we were Œ Jews 
were not allowed to have weapons and if 
we did have weapons there would be dire 
consequences and he was getting rid of it, 
and that™s it. He was just Œ he was not 
going to let the Germans have it, for sure, 
so into the Rhin e river it went. And maybe 
that was one less gun that was used in th
e war, who knows. So we Œ we knew, and

we grew up with that, and we
 went Œ and wh en we went to school we Œ we knew  we 
were in a Jewish school, we knew we had 
friends, obviously , in the Jewish school. In 
1937 - 1938, things got really
 Œ they escalated, they Œ 
the Germans Œ the Œ the rules 
and the many laws they put forth against th
e Jews affected us more and more. My 
father™s company was taken over. It 
was a Jewish company to begin with, 
Lisauer™s(ph), and th ey  Œ the Germans a
ppointed a Œ a Aryan comp any to take it 
over. And the Jews could continue to work  th
ere to show them how to operate it. And 
my father, that™s where my father™s employm
ent was, so he continued to wo rk  there. 
But obviously all opportunity 
fo r advancement etcetera wa
s gone. And we knew that 
too. Then  Œ it was at that Œ during that pe
riod of time that my  parents said, you know, 
we can™t continue to live here
. Perhaps even earlier. And th
ey started to inquire about 
how they  could get out of Germany. It wa
s very difficult. The quota for America was 
completely full, it was years 
to wait to get Œ to get to 
America, but fortunately my 
father had co nnections through his business,
 in England and in 
Holland. Particularly 
in Ho lland he had good friends, we did a lo
t of business. And so he started making 
arrangements to get permission to work  
and live in Holland, while he was still 
employed in Germany. We started hearing 
about concentration camps about that time 
and we knew people who were either livin
g in the neig hborhood, or Œ or who had 
come recently from Poland where they had 
sought refuge in Germany, that the 

Gestapo came and picked them up and sent
 them back. And where were they going?

They  were going to  concentr
ation camps. Everybody knew 
there were concentration 
camps. Certainly all the Jews knew. What ha
ppened th ere that time, we didn™t know. 
They were just taken away. And this was ki
nd of a frightening scenario. My parents, 
who Œ I Œ I Œ I guess most German Jews
 who had lived  there fo-for many, many 
years did not fear that they would be take
n aw ay one day. It wa
s mostly Œ at that 
time, mostly the immigran
ts that came into Germ
any from the east, from Œ 
principally from Poland who we
re the subject of this. They
 didn™t Œ the Germans just 
picked th em up, put them on a train, sent 
them out. And one day I was in school and 
it really brought it home to me. W e were in
 the middle of a class, and suddenly some 
men walked  into th e classroom, and th ey
 started calling out names of our fellow 
students, and they said come with us, and 
to ok them out. And my  brother and I, when  
we got home that day, we asked our parent
s, this and this is what happened. Wh at 
happened ? And they  explained it to us. Thes
e were the sons of Po lish parents who 
had settled there and sent their kids to the 
Jewish school where we were and they had 
been called by the Gestapo and they had a 
few hours to get their things and their 
children together because they were being 
tran sported out. This was frightening for a 

child, you know, to know
 that you could be in a class,
 that somebody could come in 
and order you out, and with
 your parents you™re going somewhere else. You™re going 
out to so me Œ someplace, and of course we
 knew then that th
ey were going to 
concen tration camps, or Œ

Q: H-Ho w did you know th at
 there were concentration camps in the late 30™s? 
A: My Œ my parents knew, I 
knew  it from my  parents. And they  Œ they had heard of, 
or known, I think, friends and acquaintan
ces who had gone, some of them had been 
released and Œ at one period or another and 
they told of the one
s that had not been 
released that had been sent to various cam
ps. So we knew there were concentration 
camps. How? I only knew it from my parents. 
Q: Did you talk about what was happening 
with friends, o-other boys outside your 
family? Was this a Œ a topic of conversatio
n among very  young children at the time, 

or Œ 

A: No, it really wasn™t. I don™t remember 
having school friends at my  house, for 
instance, or me being at another student™s 
home. We had recess and we play ed  in the 
schoolyard together and there 
we had ballgames and all kind
s of things that kids do 
in the Œ during recess, but when  we went
 home, we went home and we had our life 
with our family only. We did not have 
school friends and schoolmates whom we 
played with, not at that age.  

Q: What about neighborhood 
ch ildren? You said you lived in a mixed neighborhood, 
did you play with non-Jewish children? 
A: No, I don™t recall Œ I don™t recall that
. I Œ our time was taken up in going to  
school, coming back, being w
ith our parents, going with
 our parents to see our 
grandparents, going on excursions during week
ends, that kind of thing, and I don™t

recall having any other friends in Œ neighborhood
 friends that we played with or that 
we saw. 
Q: As a six or seven year old, were yo
u afraid of your n
on-Jewish neighbors? 
A: No, we were not afraid of them. We we
re not afraid of our neighbors. We had 
some very nice neighbors, I know my  pare
nts spoke to the peop
le who lived across 
the hall and as a matter of fact
 Œ I know for a fact that one of the Œ that family lived 
across the hall, the man  was a member of th
e SA, but he was quite nice. He always 
made it his busin ess to Œ he Œ he ran a groc
ery store or a butcher shop, I™m not sure 

which, and when  he had someth
ing that he could bring, he
 brought it, gave it to us. 
So they lived Œ these German
s lived two lives. They lived 
one life in which they paid 
homage to th e Nazi party and ev erything and 
the trappings that went with that and 
they heard the stories abou
t how evil Jews were, and yet they could live across the 
hall from a family of Jews and still find th
em as decent and hone
st individuals and 
work with them. That™s the strange part
. And Œ that these people could have 
promulgated what they did to 
the Jews and be a part of th
at is a Œ something that will 
always be a my stery. Oh, I have lo
ts of theories on that. [inaudible] 
Q: We™ll get to that. 
A: Right.

Q: What did Hitler mean to you as a six or
 a seven year old? Did you hear his Œ see 
his pictures, hear his speeches, wh at Œ wh
at impressions does that make then on a 
very young child? 
A: Well, we saw Hitler in the way that ou
r parents saw him and our grandparents saw 
him and their friends, and he was the object 
of ridicule in the Jewish community. As 
this Œ so we Œ we had zero respect for Adol
f Hitler. He was a menace, I think, for all 
of us in the Jewish community and our 
parents and our friends
. And I had no other 
thoughts, but you know, Adolf Hitler was not
 the Œ we Œ we knew that was somebody 
we should not like, and as a six or 
seven year old, that was about it. 
Q: Did you have any nightmares,
 things like that about him? 
A: No, none. None whatsoev
er. What scared us perhaps was the Œ th-the police, 
cause they were so unmoving and so Œ th ey
 had their Œ now, how can I describe them 
best? Autocratic. There was no appealing 
to  them, you know, you Œ you Œ and in 
Germany, if some -- if a police officer or 
Œ or a [indecipherable] told you something, 
you did it. There was no appeal
 from it, it w as a person to be feared. And Hitler was 
just the head of this whole establishmen
t, created these people. No w, police were 
never the kind of people that
 I could warm up to, and perhaps it comes from those 
days in Germany. The authority figure Œ y
ou know, if you feel that you™re doing 
everything right and you™re 
suddenly faced with a -- a policeman who™s telling you, 
or giving you au thority, you Œ 
th Œ there™s always that appr
ehension, what is it that I

did wrong? And if I didn™t 
do an ything wrong, why is 
he standing here, you know? 
Why is he poking his nose into  my  business?
 And that was pretty much it, we stayed 
away from the police. 
Q: Did you see any examples of degrada
tion on th e streets, and when  you were 
outside of Œ degradation of Jews on 
the streets, you personally see anything? 
A: No, I did not. I don™t recall seeing anyt
hing like that, except 
for when Œ well, now, 
even when they took 
the children out of school, they di
dn™t forcibly tear them apart 
or what have you. I -- my first co ntact w
ith that sort of thing where there was an 
assault on property or individuals was 
the night that we left Germany. 
Q: Were your parents Zionists in any 
way? Had they  thought about going to 
Palestine? 

A: My mother was an very
 arch Zionist, she wanted 
very  mu ch to go pa Œ to  
Palestine. My father was not
 so much a Zionist. I thin
k there was a period of time 
when  they  would have Œ they were looking
 to get out of Germany because they knew 
that this was not a place for Jews to be 
living. But their ties 
to Germany were so 
strong and so deep an d so an
cient that they could not Œ 
I don™t think any Œ any of 
them could believe that th Œ it would lead to 
a matter of life and death. And as long as 
they could earn a living, this might blow 
over. After all, knowle
dge of assaults on 
Jews and pogroms had been common knowledge
 throughout history and this was just 
another period that they  were going thro ugh. 
But as things got worse and worse, they 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

23
recognized they 
ought to get out. And then the sear
ch sta rted, how do Œ how do we 
get out. And I know my  parents tried to 
get out to any numb er of places, South 
America, A merica, even to Africa. I think th
ey tried to go to Rh
odesia once, but that 
didn't  work either. 

Q: Was this something they kept informing 
you of, or did you hear
 about this later? 
A: We knew they were Œ sorry
. We knew that th
ey were searching. And my interest 
in geography I think may have arisen from th
at search. I don™t remember specifically 
how but I do know that they 
were not happy. We spent tim
e in Holland and of course 
that™s where we escaped to
, really, was to Holland.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And that™s a different story. But that™s generally what my life was like as a 
youngster. 

Q: When  you would see a swastika on a flag
 or a banner, did it evoke any feelings on 
your part? 
A: Well, it was a sign of the authority, th
e German authority, and did it evoke any 
feelings at that time? I don™t 
think so, not at that time. 
That came a little later, w h en 
people started wearing the armb and. Then yo
u would sense that they were part of the 
crowd that really hated Jews and made yo
u feel uncomfortable, didn™t Œ they  didn™t 
want anything to  do with you, they  didn't wa
nt you to  be part of their lives and so it 
was a sign that these were Œ these were 
anti-Semites. I guess in our own way we

knew that the minute we saw that armband it wa
s Œ they were part of that authority in 
Germany that we feared. Some time in 1937 
Œ 1938 it became absolu
tely clear to my 
father that they had to  get out. And my  pa
rents, because of his contacts in Holland, 
made arrangements to seek permission to 
work in Ho lland. And since his company 
had an  office in Amsterdam and he had frie
nds, his business acquaintances were very 
close friends in Amsterdam, that was a logical
 place to go. So they Œ my father had a 
Œ a Œ he™s told me these stories. His comp
any was involved in international trading, 
and as such, they had special permission fro
m the Reichsbank to travel and to  make 
deals in Œ abroad. And 
my  father, being a young man at 
the Œ at that time was the one 
who was assigned th at task, to go to  Ho lland
 and to  England, etcetera. And he used 
this permission, which was in letter form, 
to travel rather freely. And he would use 
that for Œ to gain permission to enter the 
-- England or Ho lland, etcetera. So while he 
was over there working, he made arrangeme
nts to obtain the permission to wo rk in 
Holland, wh ich he did. And wh en he came 
back they Œ and made the final decision 
that their Œ they were leavi
ng, th ey said well, we have 
to go to Ho lland. We have to 
find a place to live. We have to see what™s
 going on, let™s take a month or so. We™re 
going to  go and we™re going to  make these a
rrangements, then we™ll come back and 
wrap up everything we have and bring it 
to Holland. So in the summer of ni Œ of 
1938, we went by car and my  father had his 
papers with him, so we got Œ arrived at 
the Dutch border and we were stopped. Now, 
do you have anything to declare, this ca 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

25
Œ you know, at the German side. And the Du
tch side was Œ they were standing, they 
were wide open, no problem over there, but
 Œ and my father said no, we don™t have 
anything to declare and they said, how 
about the boys? Why ar
e you leaving? And 
my  father said to them, well, you know, th
ey -- we have polio  
in Œ in  Co logne. And 
it™s the summer, we want our children to be
 safe from that, we Œ oh, so you have 
polio in Cologne? Well, that mean s your child
ren were going to ha
ve to get a health 
certificate, because we can™t let you go acr
oss the border. Obviously we can™t allow 
polio to spread. Course they 
knew we were Jewish Œ Jews, the passports had all been 
stamped with a J, so they knew. And my
 father said well, how do I get these 
permissions to get across to Holland, th-t he health certificate? They said oh, you 
can™t get them, you might just as well go back
. And he said no, how can we Œ th en he 
insisted. He said, well you have to s
ee the [indecipherable] I guess, the county 
executive or whatever 
in that area and he can do it. 
Well, where can I find him? And 
he said well, he™s in such and such a town
, whatever. And my fath
er took off to get 
that. In the meantime we stayed
 there at the border with my
 mother and they tore our 
car apart. Literally went through everything 
to see whether we had anything at all. 
And as my mother tells it, we had Œ we 
had gotten some gifts from some friends or 

relatives in Switzerland, the coats and 
hats and my  Aunt Selma had put some 
perfume in the hatban d, and 
they  found that, of course, and confiscated it, which 
made Norbert and I very upset that they
 would take that away from us. And my 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
26
mo ther said, don™t you worry about it, whatev
er it is, we can replace it. Let them have 
it. And we waited for my father
 to come back. Well, as the 
story goes, my fath er told 
me, he said he went to see him and he wa
s occupied so mewhere and insisted he go in 
and see this county executive, 
and he walked  into his offi
ce, and he gave him a quick  
heil Hitler. And he said, why 
can™t I go across the border, I have my children, they 
have Œ we have polio in  Œ in
 Cologne and th ey insist on 
having th e certificate. And so 
the fellow said well, you know, if you don™
t mind, you know, they
 Œ they have polio 
here in Ho lland. If you don™t object to your
 children being ex pose
d to that, then why 
should we, and he signed it, gave it to him.
 So he came back to
 the border and there 
we were, everything had been stripped an
d taken and it was quite late by then. And 
the Œ the Germans were furious, of course, 
that he had come up with the certificate, 
they didn™t want him to Œ didn™t want to 
give him that opportun
ity that Œ to leave. 
And even though it was very late, the Œ an
d the Dutch border supposedly had closed. 
So they thought that maybe 
this was all over, we couldn™t
 get in any mo re. And the 
German said, okay, you can go
, with a smirk on th eir faces, I guess, knowing that the 
other side was closed. Well, lo and behold,
 they started drive across and the Du tch 
opened th e border and they said, what was go
ing on there? And th ey said, you know, 
we seen a lot of this with Jews. We kept the border open for y
ou. So  the Dutch were 
extremely decent and wonderful 
people and we went over 
and for the next month or

six weeks we stayed in a Œ kind of a re
sort to wn on the beac
h, and Œ in Holland. 
Sunfort was the name of the reso Œ the Œ th e beach town. 
Q: While you were waiting for your father, 
do you reme mber that
, and what did you 
Œ 

A: Oh, yeah Œ 

Q: Œ and your brother do? Was it a fearfu
l time? Did you think your father was 
maybe not going to  come back? 
A: I don™t remember my feelings. I think 
we trusted our parent
s explicit Œ implicitly 
and had no concern th at he wo
uldn™t come back. We just 
waited. I had Œ honestly I 
don™t rememb er. You know, those are thi
ngs that they leave. I remember Œ I 
remember the Œ the searching 
and I remember the fact that
 they took these silly little 
bottles of perfume, and just waited, and then 
off we went. And we Œ when we were in 
Holland, my pa Œ we were at 
this resort and my parents 
put Norb ert and I into a Œ I 
guess best described as a summ er camp , 
my  Œ wh ich we enjoyed because it was 
beach, it was the ocean
 right there and Œ 
Q: Did you know Dutch? 
A: No, I didn™t speak any Dutch. And my  pa
rents said Œ made certain arrangements, 
they got whatever necessary a
rrangements they needed  to  ma
ke in order to Œ to make 
their final move, and asked our friends to 
find an apartment for them. And they were 

going to  go back to Germany and pick up th
eir things and head 
off. And they said, 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

28
you know boys, I think you sh
ould stay here. Because at that time th ings were really 
getting bad, it was difficult to get money ou
t of Germany, couldn™t be done any 
longer. And they didn™t want 
to put us in harm™s way. But my  brother and I became 
absolutely hysterical. We didn™t
 want to be separated from 
our parents, and we raised 
quite a ruckus. So much so that our parent
s said well, we™ll take you back, we will 
somehow manage. Something happens to us 
we™ll all g o  through it. And we actually 

went back  to Germany. 
Q: You boys were seven and a ha
lf at the poin Œ at this point. 
A: That was, that time seven and a half 
years old, exactly. So back  we went to 
Colo gne and my  parents at that time wrapped up wh at they could. They  sent their 

bookcases and some f-furniture
, books mostly because they
 loved books, they loved 
reading, so this was very important for th
em that they bring 
their bookcases with 
them, and sent them off with the moving va
n. And my  father got 
tickets for Œ no, he 
didn™t get tickets there, they – he made 
whatever final arrangements had to be made 
t-to Œ to get out. And wh en 
the fu rn iture was moved, ha
ppened  to be on Novemb er 
eighth, and out we went, the apartment was em
pty. So we went over to see Œ to Œ to 
live in hotel for one Œ for one night because the next day we were taking the train, 

and we were [indecipherable
] we were going to Ho lland. 
So we went over to the 
Dome Hotel, which was right across the st
re et  from the cathedra
l in Œ in Cologne. 
And the Dome Hotel is situated on one of 
the main shopping streets in the city of

Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holo caust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with Alfred Schnog. This
 is tape number two, side A, and you 
were talking about how y
ou were in the hotel. 
A: Right. Well, we were in the Dome Hote
l, my  brother and I went to sleep. And 
sometime in the middle of the night we we
re awakened by my mo
ther. And she said 
boys, come here. And we got up and sh e took 
us to the window of
 the hotel and stood 
us between the drapes so that
 we could look out on the s 
Œ onto th e street. And down  
below was this noise of shattering glass a
nd Œ and we lo oked down  and we saw these 
unifo rmed individuals, the brown shirts, th
rowing rocks into the 
window of the store 
that was just across the street from the hotel
. And there were others inside the store 
throwing porcelain and glass out on th e stre
et, just piling it up, just heaving it out. 
And I reme mb er the Œ in the glow of the streetlights, in the ye
llowish glow of the 
streetlights and the co bblestone streets and al
l this stuff just shattering as it hit the 
floor. And my  mo ther said to me Œ sa-said 
to us, boys, she said, take a look. Never 
forget wh at you see here. And of course we
 wanted to  know wh at was happening and 
we asked wh at™s happening, and she said, th
at™s a Jewish store. One of the finest 
stores in crystal and everything and th ey™re 
just destroying it. Well, we didn™t know Œ 
what we didn™t know was that not just th
ere, but everywhere, this was going on in 
Germany and this was the night that the sy
nagogues were all burned and the Œ what 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

31
we didn™t see, the Œ the Jews being rounde
d up and being ostracized
 and as they were 
dragged down th e streets and a
ll these things. These were th
ings that we learned only 
afterwards. But we did see the carnage th
at was taking place across th e street from 
this hotel and down this Œ this whole street
. And in Œ it™s something that I don™t think 
I can ever forget, the image of it is so vivi
d in my mind, the whole thing, it™s Œ it was 
the first time in all those years that we 
actually saw violence. We had seen and we 
had feared all the other things, but this 
was true violen ce. An
d it Œ and you know, 
I™ve read a lot about these things since th
en. The Germans claime
d afterwards that it 
was an uprising on the part 
of the German people against 
the Jews. Just reme mbering 
all those people in unifo rm, it was no uprising
 of the people in, I mean it was the Œ it 
was the Œ the Hitler youth, the Œ the SA, the 
brown sh irts and whoever else wanted to 
participate in this, did this. 
Anyway, in the mo rning my  pa
rents took us to vi Œ say 
goodbye to our grandparents
, who were just across the 
river in Cologne. And the 
grandparents said, my God are you still here
? Get out, get out. A
nd then we learned 
of the carnage that had been
 happen ing the rest of the 
city, and obviously what was 
happening all over Germany at the time. Th
e synagogue had been burned , the people 
had been dragged out of their homes and they
 made fun of them as they Œ down the 
streets and what have 
you. Elderly people, a
nd Œ and they sent us
 off. They shooed us 
out, but quickly, and said get out. And so my
 parents went directly to the train station 
from there and we got on th e train to go to  
Ho lland. There were a lot of other Jews on

the train. Many of them had come from th
e east, finding their way through. And 
some of them had, as we found out a few da
ys later, so me of them who were actually 
on their way to emigrate to the United Stat
es were also on the train. And the train 
took off. What we didn™t know, which we 
learned shortly thereafter is that the 
Germans has sealed the borders everywhere
. And we arrived at the Dutch border. 
Police boarded the train. All Jews, out of th
e train. And we were all taken out of the 
train, all our baggage off the train, put 
on a cart, a horse drawn cart without a horse, 
and we were marched to a jail.
 Best thing I could describe 
it as, and locked up in a Œ 
in a room. I reme mb er the room vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in 
that cell. A nd I remember the green door 
and the bars on the door and the window 
and the toilet in the open, wh
ich was to be used by ev ery
body th ere and of course as 
children having to use the to
ilet in front of all these pe
ople was something we didn™t 
like, and I remember the-they sh ielded us 
wh en we had to do so . And we were there 
for a period of time, I™m not sure how long . My father had some papers with him and 
in Œ it Œ and he was concerned th at th
e Germans might see those papers and 
misinterpret them or find th em, and he ate 
them. And for my brother and I, this was a 
marvel to see. I think maybe made a big im
pression on us mo re-so than even  going to 
jail is that my  father would eat paper. And 
these are Œ it™s funny, the things that you 
rec-recollect. And so metime within that day 
or the next day Œ it seemed to me it was 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
33
just one night that we spent there, but my
 parents have often said it was almo st a 
week, and I don™t recall that. I think it was just
 Œ I think it was just that Œ that night. 
Q: Were Œ were there other children,
 or were you bo
ys the only ones? 
A: I believe we were the only boys. There we
re a lot Œ there were other people in that 
cell, in that room. Some of them were 
single men and single wo men, you know, these 
were groups. Husband and wife maybe, perh
aps families as well. And at one point I 
guess we ha Œ my  father had an opportunity
 to  speak to  the commandant there of Œ 
whoever he was. And he expl
ained to him that he was tr
aveling here on business. He 
had this document from Œ still Œ the Reichs
bank, and that he 
had Œ was going to 
Holland to bid on so me very important mate
rials which were needed for the Œ the war 
effort in Germany or for the military, and 
they couldn™t keep us 
incarcerated because 
he had to get on with th is busin ess. And th e man apparently told  them well, you 
know, I have to see Œ I Œ first thing I have 
to do is feed 3,000 Jews. He said, we™ll 
take care of you after that™s done. But ap
parently, coincidentally, the Œ there was a 
ship sailing from Holland for th
e United States which had 
booked passage for about a 
thousand Jews who had permission to come
 to the United States. The Aidam(ph) was 
the name of the vessel. And apparently
 this was made known to the German 
authorities there and they didn™t want to cr
eate a situatio n Œ at least we think they 

didn't  want to create a situation wher
e there would become known that they 

prevented Jews from leaving. It would ha
ve been politically unwise, maybe created 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
34
too mu ch  of a public relations problem for 
them. So they decided to let those Jews 
who had that passage booked, and pay for us
 to go to Holland to 
catch that ship, it 
was sailing from Holland, to go. And my  father
 said, well look, I have my  papers for 
Holland. Didn™t have any passage on th at ship
 or anything like that. And somehow he 
managed to get us in with this group to  go
 to Holland. And it was 
just, I think, good 
fortune. There was a point just before we 
went into this jail where we Œ where my 
mother and father were told by the Œ 
whoever was leading us to this ersatz 

concentration camp that they 
had put up, or that Œ this 
jail where they were going, 
where they  were apparently separating or 
segregating people, wh
ere they were going 
to put them and wh at have you, assign them
 to some rooms. A
nd they said to my 
parents, they said look, yo
u will go to a concentration 
camp where you will be safe. 
Your children will go to an or
phanage. And of course the minute Norbert and I heard 
this Œ and I recall that too Œ 
we started to raise the roof 
because we were not going to  
be separated from our parents. This was 
Œ we were just, I guess frightened. And I 
mean, really scared that we might be 
separated from them. And my mother said, 
children calm down. No body is going to se
parate us from anybody. Before that 
happens, I will take your lives and mine 
right here. And she made it known, she was 
very distinct about it, and sh e always ca
rried a Œ through her lifetime she always 
carried a paring knife, which she used to pe
el apples, cause she loved apples. And she 

was fully prepared to take that knife and 
cut our throats and her 
own throat so that 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

35
that wouldn't happen. And it wasn't so 
stran g e, because there were people who 
attempted suicide in that ja
il because they had 
lost everything, th
ey knew they  were 
going to  be sent to a concen tration camp , back wh ere they came from. And there 
were any numb er of suicide 
attempts, some of them perh
aps successful, I don™t know. 
Anyway , that was Œ in that mo me nt, I don™
t know what made th
e Germans say forget 
about it, or go on with your Œ th e way I 
heard it my  mo ther said, go on, take your 
brats and get out of here. I™m not sure that
 that was the case, cause I don™t remember 
that, but it could very  well have been. And we
 went Œ we were then on the train with 
all these other people, or we went to the bord
er with all these othe
r people to cross to 
go in to Holland. 

Q: Do you know wher
e the jail w as located? 
A: No. Oh, wait a minute – I don™
t have a recollection of it. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It was on the Du tch border, obviously, I 
Œ I don™t know where. But we got to the 
border, my  father telephoned across and got 
ahold of his friend and said look, we™re 
here, get over here fast. We™ve got to get 
out of here. And they
 Œ they came, they 
picked us up and took us to 
a Œ an inn, I guess, in Ho
lland, where for Œ I remember 
my  parents telling me the Du tch couldn™t ha
ve been nicer. They saw us, they knew 
what had happened, they™d asked all kinds of
 questions about us. They laid out Œ they 
had a table of food, that was the food Œ the 
kinds of things they
 Œ my  parents hadn™t

seen in Œ in years in Germany. And their 
eyes opened and Œ and th ey had even  put us 
in a hotel, they had drawn th e 
water in the tub, hot water so they could take a bath 
because they apparently had been Œ it was a fe
w days before we got out of that jail to 
get across, and it was just a tr
emendous relief to be out of Germany, and to f Œ and be 
in Ho lland and feel reasonably safe that this
 was not going to  Œ that we were going to 
survive this Œ this thing. 
Q: Had you brought anything special with
 you as a youngster, special possession? 
Toys or books, or anything special? 

A: I don™t recall that we did. We had some
 toys and my  parents, I™m sure put them 
onboard the moving van wh en it left Germa
ny and I™m sure that it arrived in Holland 
and that we played with th
em, but it Œ I didn™t Œ don™t rememb er carrying anything 
with us of that nature. What
 I do remember is the Œ sitti
ng in the hotel with Œ being 
fed this wonderful food. I™d never eaten fish 
or I didn't  like fish and my  parents were 
offering me Dover sole, my God,
 I™d Œ I™d kill to have that t-today, I still do, I love it, 
you know. But in thos
e days, as a kid, you didn™t wa
nt to eat that stuff. And you 
know, as Œ wonderful stories. My parents 
wanted us to learn Dutch as quickly as 
possible. And th ey had, in the period 
of time between wh en
 we came back from 
Holland the first time in Germ
any, and then  left finally to leave, they had taken 
Dutch lessons from a teacher, local teacher
 who came over and taught them some 
Dutch. And we were sitting on a couch, an
d behind me on the couch, on the wall was 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
37
a Œ a string with a Œ that you could pull an
d it would ring, it would send off a bell for 
room service, or for someb
ody to come. And we had finished eating a meal and my  
parents wanted the hotel to know that so th
ey could co me and clear the dishes, and in 
Œ I guess it™s in Dutch, the na
me for a bell is like English,
 a bell. And in German bell 
Œ belling is to bark, like a dog.
 So they turn ed to us, tu
rned  to me and they said 
bellmal(ph), or you know, ring the bell. And 
I looked at them kind of strange, I said, 
what do you want me to do? They said 
it again and I said bo
w wow. Which was the 
only thing I understood. Well, it w as the hila
rity of that moment and the relief of 
being Œ of having gone through what they
 had just experienced and gone through, 
that created a moment of just pure joy. 
And we laughed so heartily, all of us, and I Œ 
course I di Œ first I didn™t know wh at they
 were laughing about,
 but then, you know, 
the explanation of it all was even Œ was qu
ite a good deal of f
un fo r me and Œ and Œ 
and that™s how Œ that™s how 
we got into Ho lland. And Œ 
and shortly th ereafter we 
moved in to an apartment wh ich our friends 
had gotten for us in Amsterdam in a very, 
very lovely area. And Œ and 
we, my  brother and I went to
 school there, a Jewish 
school in Amsterdam. Very, very  strict 
Orthodox Jewish school. We Œ I remember 
my  parents Œ my  mo ther sent us off to 
school on the first day with  sandwiches, and 
they had meat on the sandwiches. And so
 we got there and it was time to go out 
lunch to eat and they  discovered that we 
had meat on the sandwiches and my  brother 
and I were made to go outside and eat them
 th ere because they 
were kosher and God

forbid  somebody would contaminate their kosher atmo sphere with  our meat 
sandwiches. 

Q: Now, we™re talking December ™38? 
A: This was in Œ probably Novemb er, or 
di Œ maybe Decemb er, yeah, by that time 
we were settled, it was December, or j Œ  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And so when  I came home I told my  pa
rents never to send me to school ag ain 
with a sandwich that had Œ I think it was pot
 roast, which I loved, on it, you know, i-
it had to be vegetarian or 
Œ or some milk substance, 
cheese or whatever. And Œ  
Q: Were there many immigrant children,
 you know, non-Dutch Jews Œ Jewish 
children in your school? 

A: Not th at I know of, no. Th
ere were Œ th-the children I 
came in contact with were 
all Dutch and we learned very
, very rapidly the language from them. My brother and 
I spoke Dutch fluently within a matter of 
weeks. An-A nd Dutch is not such a difficult 
language for somebody who speaks German
. So we learned it very rapidly and I 
reme mb er having so me of the struggles 
wh en  you  u sed  to  so metimes mix  my  

German words with Dutch, but that was a
ll gone very, very rapidly. And we loved 
Holland, because it Œ we lived 
in a Œ we lived on the Zu
ideramstellaan, which today 
is known as Rooseveltlaan. They changed th
e name. A big, wide boulevard, divided 
into four lanes, I guess, three or four lane s. And there was a streetcar in the front and 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

39
it was wonderful for my brother and I caus
e we could walk around the corn er and 
rent bicycles. And, you know, fo
r a child the first time to ha
ve a bicy cle is a lot of fun 
and these were dreadful bikes when  you th
ink about it in terms of what a modern 
bicycle looks like, but they
 were, nevertheless, a lot 
of fun. And then  it was 
wintertime and the canals were
 frozen and you could go and 
skate and we went to see 
that and I rememb er that so vividly, people
 skating as far as they wanted to. And not 

anywhere did we as Œ s-see a sign Jews were
 not wanted. No place in Ho lland. Didn't 
exist. [indecipherable] 

Q: What did that do for you? 

A: Hm? 
Q: What did that do for you? 
A: Well, it was just Œ I don™t know whethe
r I was Œ that I even thought about it. I 

think it was I just took it for granted, that 
this was Holland, that it was Œ we were Œ it 
was different. There were Œ there were no m
ilitary marches, no Œ no police that Œ or 
Hitler youth that would march around and wave th
eir flags. It was just Œ didn™t exist.  
Q: Did the Dutch Jewish
 children accept you? 

A: Yes, they certainly did. We had no 
trouble getting along with  the Dutch Jewish 
children. My parents were able still, in 
1938 - 1939, shortly after they arrived in 
Holland, to get my  parents Œ my  grandparen
ts out of Germany. No w, we know th at 
they mu st have left without anything, beca
use Œ at least my  grandparents mu st have

left Germany with nothing in their pocke
ts, to speak. We know that Œ well, the 
Germans made the Jews pay for all the dama
ge they Œ they cause
d on Kristallnacht, 
that™s history. And they  weren™t allowed 
to  own property, they
 weren™t Œ things 
became so oppressive for Jews that my gr
andfather, I™m sure, sold his house for a 
pittance at that time because there was nothi
ng else he could do with it. Whether he 
could every take the money with  him to ge
t it out, I don™t know, I have no idea. But 
they managed to get them to Holland, and 
they had an apartmen
t in Amsterdam, not 
too far from where we lived. My brother and 
I used to bicycle down to their place. As 

a matter of fact, a-about 10 years ago it is no
w that I was in Amsterdam, I went to see 
where we lived, which I r-re-re
membered. I™ve been there r
ecently too, and I actually 
took some pictures of that. And I could fi
nd my way still, to my
 grandparents home, 
it™s so well ingrained in my  mind. My pare
nts, the mo ment they arrived in Holland 
said well, we™ve got to star
t thinking about a little Œ ge
tting even further away from 
Germany and fi
nding a Œ another place to 
go because if it can happen there, it can Œ 
might happen here. We just don™t feel secure. 
It was not just that, it was also, I think 
for economic reasons. You can 
imagine all the Jews that
 wound up in  Ho lland, all 

seeking employment. And the competition for 
my father must have been extremely 
severe. He was the young man who arrived, he
 got the dirty jobs. He had to do all the 
traveling, which in many ways was f Œ wa
s good, it helped, beca
use he could Œ he 
went to Œ to England quite a gr
eat deal. Matter of fact, he 
even Œ he even
 walked into

the foreign office in England, offered his se
rvices because he was so much aware of 
where German industry was a
nd what they needed and what
 they had to buy, because 
that was his business, this is what he did. 
And he ma Œ was able later to make use of 
those connections, when we finally left Ho lland to come to the United States, he was 
Œ that Œ that helped him a great d eal. But 
they had Œ my  parents, during the time that 
they were in Germany had a
pplied for visas to come to America as did practically 
every Jew in Germany. And the likelihood
 of that happening was extremely, 
extremely slim. It was a lotte
ry system and Œ and when  he
 Œ and when they wound up 
in Holland, my father said you know, I™m 
going to  contact the American embassy in 
Stuttgart and we will have our files transfe
rred to Rotterdam. Afte
r all, we™re now in 
Holland, doesn™t do us any good 
to have that file in Stuttg
art, why not? So he wrote 
them a letter and he got the file transfe
rred over there. And I suppose that lot of 
things came that worked together at that 
time. There were a lot of people who just 
couldn™t, even when  their number came 
up for a visa, couldn™t accept it any mo re 

cause they™d already been tr
ansported somewhere else, to 
the concen tration camp s, or 
what have you. And the quot
a suddenly opened up en ough so
 th at one day Œ we were 
in Ho lland I think fo r almo st a year and a ha
lf, two years, close to that. Suddenly he 
got a call from Rotterdam, Mr. Schnog, bring 
your family here for a medical ex am. If 
you pass the medical exam you will be able
 to come to the United States, you™ll get 
your visa. So they  had to make a decision as
 to wh ether to stay Œ of course they had

jobs and they were well settled in Holland,or whether to leave. And after everything 
that happened in Germany, and I think al
so because of the severe competition for 

jobs in Holland at the time, 
they decided th-there™s no ques
tion about this, let™s Œ let™s 
get out, let™s get as far away from this me
nace in Germany as we possibly can. And 
they went to the embassy, we had our physic
als, and in two weeks 
they had a visa to 
come to the United States. A
ll that excitement, you can 
well imagine. They started 
packing up their things and making plans. 
And because th ey couldn™t Œ I don™t know 
whether they could bring th ei
r money out of Holland or 
whether they had a problem 
with that, but they 
decided to book passage first 
class because they couldn™t do 
anything else with the money, on Cunard. 
Cunard White Star line from London, or 
Liverpool they sail Œ sail from,
 to the United States. And pa
cked up our th ings, sent 
them ahead and suddenly we
 were leaving Ho lland. Left f Œ said goodbye to my  
grandparents and we went to th
e airport, Schiphol, I think 
it was, pretty sure, and we 
board ed Œ and th is was during the Œ this
 was already during th e war, during th e 
Phoney War between England and Germany,
 because in 1940 England was drawn 
into the war because the Germans had inva
ded Poland. There wa
s a Œ an agreement 
that they would Œ th at England 
would declare war, and they did. 
Q: I-I was going to ask you ab
out that, in September 1
st
, 1939, did your parents talk 
that over, were you aw are of that? 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

A: Oh, we Œ we were fully aware of 
wo rld events and wh at was happening. 
Completely. My parents were interested in 
it, I was interested in it and Œ and this 
was, for us, listening to current events was 
what it was like for American kids our age 
following th e baseball season. It was im
portant in our lives. Obviously it had 
enormous amount of Œ of impor
tance in our family. So we Œ w-we wanted to know. 
We wa Œ and war, it Œ you know, it was war 
and we a Œ we had gone through the Œ 
the Russians, I think, invading Finland, an
d this was in the news everywhere and as 
children you Œ you followed  this. In fact, 
we weren™t the only ones, I think all the 
kids in those days, followed that.

different countries and in the war. Did 
it Œ did that make you mo re fearful Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ knowing what was happening in other countries? 
A: No, it did not. We felt very secure, ve
ry safe. We had no concerns. Indeed, my  
parents had no concerns being in Ho
lland, Ho lland was a neutral and nobody 
expected that they wo uld be involved or be
come involved in a war. They  hadn™t been

in the first World War and they  were Œ cert
ainly weren™t going to  
get involved in this 
one. It was a very liberal country  and we felt 
very, very  safe there. But I do th ink that 
the economic opportunity wasn™t there and this is what really prov
ed to be the most 
important reason why my  pare
nts decided th at they should  leave and Œ and come 
somewhere else, or go somewhere else. 
Q: Now, what about your grandparents? 
Was there any thought of bringing your 
grandparents to the United States? 
A: Oh yes, of course. We Œ we felt we 
would go ah ead, we woul
d get settled and we 
would then bring them to the United St
ates, they would follow right on along. \ 
Q: What did the United States
 me an to you at that point? What did it represent to 

you? 
A: The United States was America, it was a 
Œ a dream, really. It was something that 
we had read  about. Everything good was in 
America. This is w Œ the Œ the fame of 
America, of New York, of the skyscrapers,
 of everything was Œ was known  to us. It 
was known to everyone in Europe. We Œ 
an-and it was everybody™s dream to go to 
America at one time or another, to live there or
 to at least visit. So this was wonderful 
for us to Œ we™re going to 
go to America. Was just ma
rvelous to Œ to contemplate 
that. So as a child it was great. 
Q: You had seen what, pictures in 
magazines or newspapers or movies? 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
45
A: We had seen pictures in magazines.
 This was mostly what my parents had 
explained and to ld us about. It was our 
imagination wo rking, perhap s overtime. I 
really don™t think so , I think our imaginatio
n had it right. One of the things that was 
so interesting in Holland, 
so many things happened, 
as a child this would be 
interesting, apparently  we had a friend, 
I don™t know whether he was an immigrant 
from Germany or what, and we were very 
much into cars, my brother and I. My 
father at one time in Germany had owned 
a Œ a lot, a car lot wh ere people would 
bring their old cars and he wo
uld disassemb le them for the metals, the copper and th e 
Œ all the precious metals that were inside a
nd sell the rest of it off as scrap. And my 
brother and I often went there and played in
 the old cars, you know. We™d climb into 
the cabs and turn the wheels. 
It was a lot of fun, very enjoyable. So cars were a 
passion for us, we could recognize every au
tomobile on th e street
s, what it looked 
like, whether it was an  Opal or whether 
it was a Œ a Ford or a Volkswagen or 
whatever, we knew it all. A
nd in Holland this man came  over and he Œ was a brand 
new car, I think it mu st have been a Nash or
 something like that, as I recall and it was 
a very modern styling for th
at time and my  brother and I were so impressed. Well it 
turned out this fellow had st
olen the car and it wasn™t 
long before they  caught him 
and I guess put him in jail, I hope in Ho lland, 
not in Germany, but they Œ they  did. So  
there were all these ad ventures. I remember 
my mother taking us to the tulip fields, 
and seeing that. We Œ we spent a week 
or two weeks of vacation sailing in the 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

46
Zuiderzee, which at that time was open to
 the North Sea, wh
ich has since been 
dammed in. And we were there with some 
of my  parents™ friends and colleagues, 
acquaintances and we sailed from one town  to 
the Œ all around this Œ this huge sea. 
And it was just marvelous and Œ you know, 
and th en one of these old Du tch ship s 
with the Œ what do you call 
them, the sideboards that 
would go down. They  didn™t 
have a keel, so they had sideboards and we would sail all around. My  father was a 
wonderful photographer and he took so me be
autiful, beautiful pictures of that, some 
of which I may still have, I™m not
 sure. They™re very wonderful. 
Q: Di-Did your family, your folks keep
 up their religious observance? Were you 
observing Jewish holidays wh
en you were in Holland? 
A: Yes, we were observing Jewish holiday
s. What became rea
lly less and less, the 
need to maintain a kosher
 home perhaps was still ther
e in Holland because my 
grandparents were there, but after that, when
 we left Holland, that, you know, almost 
disappeared  comp letely. An yway, going back, 
we Œ when their nu
mber Œ the Œ when 
they won the lottery to co
me to the United States, and it was truly winning th e 
lottery, we wound up at the airport there and 
we climbed aboard a DC-3 type aircraft, 
which was all painted orange and the windo
ws were frosted. And the reason for that 
was this, Holland had declared itself a neutra
l and their airplanes, their commercial 
planes, they blocked Œ they frosted the win
dows so that they couldn™t be accused of 
having sp ies on board th e airplane looking 
down at the German fortifications and

then reporting th at out. And we got on th
is airplane on wh ich my  brother and I 
immediately got sick because it bumped a
ll the way across the English channel and 
we wound up in  England. 
Q: Now, what mon Œ wha-what 
month are we talking about? 
A: We™re talking about January
 1939 Œ 1940. It was either
 very late December or 
very early Œ you know, I think it was Janua
ry. January 1940. Y
eah, exactly. And we 
arrived and went to stay at the White Hall 
Hotel on Speaker™s Corner at Hyde Park. I 
remember it very, very well.  
Q: Did you know any En
glish at this point? 
A: Not a word. Not a word  of
 English. I was fluent in 
Dutch, I could speak German, 
of course. And wh at impressed me about E
ngland were the barrage balloons. England 
being at war, although the air 
raids had not started, they 
were flying these barrage 
balloons over London. They 
were not more than, I would say 200 yards off the 
ground, up in the air. So th
ey Œ they  looked like small blimps floating everywhere. 
And all the Œ at every intersection where the police had a traffic cop or something, 

their Œ their huts were all sandbagged in. A
nd they were on a war footing. And this 
impressed us, my  brother and I. The blackou
t during the night. Cars driving around 
without Œ with shielded head
lights. And Œ so I rememb er 
that Œ that wartime London. 
And I Œ I rememb er my brother getting sick 
in the hotel, he had caught some Œ some 
something. What it was I don™t know. Bu t he
 was there, maybe it was influenza or 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

something like that, and we were stuck in 
the hotel. And my  parents had to stay with 
him. My father was out Œ would go to th
e Œ to his office there in London, he had 
friends and etcetera. And th ey sent me out 
to purch ase a bulb for a flashlight, because 
he needed  it at night, everything was black
ed out. And they sa
id okay, now you go 
down  Regent Street right here and down  a 
few blocks an d you walk  into a store, it™s 
about a block down and you go ask for a light
 bulb. Of course, they
 told me this in 
Dutch. And I said, well what™s that in En
glish? And they said, well we™ll look it up 
for you. And they lo oked it up and they sa
id, well you ask for a bulb. I said bulb? 
And she Œ yeah. And off I went, I couldn™t
 speak a wo rd  of English. And marched 
down  Regent Street, into the store and 
I asked for a bulb and managed to get it 
without any difficulty. I th
ink it Œ that was a intere
sting and very fo rmative 
experience for me. It taught me a little 
bit of independence, 
that you could go 
anywhere, and you didn™t have 
to be afraid, that you co ul
d make yourself understood, 
no matter what. And Œ and for a young Œ for a 
young man that was, I thought, kind of 
maturing and I came back and we had it. 
Now, we had to stay, we had to get 
permission in London to  stay a little longer 
because my brother was ill. And they  had 
booked th e passage with Cunard  line but 
they hadn™t Œ the ship hadn™t been 
designated at that time. So my  father had to
 go to the police there 
to get an ex tension. 
And he called his friends at the foreign o
ffice at the time and said here, you know, I 
need to get an extension, 
can you help me out? He was afraid that they wouldn™t 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

49
permit it. A nd they said well, just go to th
e police, don™t worry about it. Just go in 
there and ask them. And he went there and 
they said of course
, you know, you don™t 
have any problems here, you can stay as
 long as you like. This they didn't  
understand, or didn™t Œ you 
know, they didn™t expect it.
 I can™t say they didn™t 
understand it, they didn™t expe
ct it. They didn™t expect that you co uld have so  mu ch 
freedom in Œ in any country  and there woul
dn™t be somebody w
ho would say no, you 
can™t do this or you can™t Œ you Œ you mu st
 have these papers, or you mu st go back. 
I™m sorry, you can™t stay, you 
have to go back  to wh ere you came from. Not there. 
And these were very comforting for them. My
 brother and I didn™t Œ really weren™t 
concerned, cause we weren™t aware that thes
e Œ that this might be a problem or that 
they were Œ tha-that my parents were conc
erned about it. But even tually Œ of course 
my  brother got better in about three or four
 weeks and in March, I guess it was, must 
have been March, we finally 
told that the Œ we would have
 the passage on the Cunard 
White Star liner, the Britannic, and to go to
 Liverpool on such and such a day and we 
board  Œ th ey didn™t tell us what the name of
 the ship was because they were afraid 
that there would be too many Œ too mu ch in
fo rmation around and it would get back to 
the Germans and there was this submarin
e warfare going on. They  didn't want 
anybody to know 
what ships were in po
rt and when they woul
d be sailing. So th ey 
just said, come to Liverpool and you™ll 
be on one of the vessels, t h e ships.  

Q: Were there many German Jews that you were aware of? 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
50
A: Yes, there were. There were German 
Jews who were also setting sail for the 
United States at that time. We showed 
up at Liverpool and we w Œ board ed th e 
Britannic, and my  father had been told wh en
 he booked  the passage that they would 
be traveling in convoy across 
the Atlantic because of th
e submarine warfare. And we 
expected that. So next day we set sail. My parents had bought these first class tickets 

and we were in first class. There were Œ an
d this is where it is, there were many Jews 
and people who were traveli
ng in steerage, so  to speak, 
and th ey co uldn™t even  visit 
us. And we knew some of them, my  parent
s knew some of them, but Œ but we as Œ 
we were ensconced in very, 
very luxurious quarters on th
e ship, and was Œ we Œ we Œ 
there™d be these easy chairs on the deck an
d th ey would serve bo
uillon and all kinds 
of goodies, and was wonderful for kids. A
nd indeed , on th Œ on th e voyage across I 

fell in love with English omelets, jelly om
elets, they were wonderful. I la Œ had one 
every day my mother says and I Œ I still reme
mber them, they were great. But we got 
Œ we were told that we woul
d have to have a lifeboat drill 
almost daily because of the 
fear of being s Œ being attacked by a submar
ine. And my  parents made us sleep in our 
clothes with our shoes next to the bed, an
d if we heard the foghorn three times, we 
were to get in Œ get those shoes on, don™t tie
 the laces, ju st get them on, grab the life 
preservers and report to our lifeboat st
ations. Course, it never came to that, 
fortunately. But the first day out my fath
er Œ we looked arou
nd and I was expecting 
to see this huge convoy of
 ships going across the ocean
 and I looked outside and 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
51
there wasn™t a ship in sight. And my father
 went to the captain and said, you know, I 
thought we were traveling convoy, where 
are all the other ships? And the captain 
said, oh that™s nonsense, we are so fast 
we™d outrace any convoy an d we™re going 
across the ocean. And indeed they did. As a matter of fact they zigzagged all the way 
across the ocean and I could stand on the tail 
of the ship and see 
the wake zigzagging 
across, to throw off any poten
tial torpedo, I guess, that wa
s directed in our Œ i Œ to Œ 
directed in our direction, so
 Œ and that was the voyage. I 
reme mb er it and I loved it, 
as any child would, on a big sh ip. And we 
arrived in New York and were greeted by 
friends whom had Œ w
ho had preceded us to the Un
ited States. Indeed , he was a 
partner of my father™s in that
 auto wrecking yard at one tim
e. And they took us to the 
Œ to the Œ to a hotel on Br
oadway, the Whitehall Hotel. Did I say Whitehall before? Is 
that the hotel in Great Britain? It™s not th
e right Œ that™s not the right name. The one 
in Great Britain was Œ  

Q: What -- what Œ what -- 
A: No, it was the whiteh Œ Wh
itehall Hotel in New York. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It was on Hu ndredth Street and Broadway. 
Q: Wh-When did you Œ wh en did 
you land in the United States? 
A: On April 1
st
, 1940 we landed in the Un ited States, and Œ

Q: What Œ what was your Œ were your fo
lks still in communicatio
n with Œ to your 
grandparents? 
A: Yes, yes they were. 
Q: By Œ and how? 
A: Well, they could communicate, there 
was certainly correspondence by letter and 
you could even telephone still,
 or Œ Holland was a Œ still 
a neutral at that time and it 
was certainly possible to commu
nicate with them. And when
 we moved into  the ho Œ 
hotel on Œ on Broadway 
and Hu ndredth Street Œ 
Q: Okay, ju-just a mo ment. When you were
 on th e boat, any other children? Did you 
play with other children?  
A: No. There were no other children that I 
rememb er on the boat with us. Just other 
passengers from any numb er of places. I don™t reme mb er really any of them 
particularly, we were [indecipherable] 

Q: Did people exchange stories? Other 
Œ other passengers exchange stories about 
their backgrounds? 

A: They may have, but none that I recall. 
I Œ no idea. Anyway, we came to the States 

and we were ensconced in the Whitehall 
Hotel on Broadway and Hu ndredth Street 
and my  mother took us right away over to 
the nearest school, enro lled us in school 
and we didn™t speak any Œ a wo
rd of English, again. And Œ

Q: What was it like to arrive in the Un
ited States? The boat 
docks and you got off. 
Did it mean anything to a Œ a youngster of nine years old? 
A: I remember being on the side of the sh
ip and my  parents sa
id look, there™s the 
Statue of Liberty. And I looked, and so  he
lp me, I didn™t see it. It w as the Œ must 
have been right under my  nose, but I didn
™t see it. I don™t know where I was looking, 
maybe they were pointing awkwardly and I ju
st looking around at all the other ships 
in the harbor, etcetera. It™s skipped, comp
letely. And we pulled in to the pier and we 
cleared through customs 
in Œ almost instantly. 
Q: Did you notice any change in your fo lks 
wh en they  put their feet Œ foot Œ put Œ 
when  they  put their feet down on American soil? 
A: No, th Œ I think everybo
dy was smiles, that I rememb e
r. It was a happy time. We Œ 
we were met by the Œ our acquaintances here
 and they  said come, we take you to 
your hotel and they took us with all 
our luggage on the 
subway. Through the 
turnstiles. Now, I don™t know whether you 
remember the old fashioned turnstiles, but 
they were Œ in the subways 
Œ but they were th ese wooden 
affairs that looked like very 
big, huge, heavy propellers that you w
ould push around. And we™d  had to drag  
through these things. Bu t be Œ but evenbef Œ before that, we Œ we had to get 

something to eat so they took us to th
e automat. Well for us, we™ve never seen 
anything like this. First of all, there was so
 much fo od of everything, every kind that 
we could ev er want. And th en, to be able 
to just put coins into
 a machine and have

54
these things pop out was marvelous. We Œ 
we enjoyed that. And we wound up, as I 
say, at the end of the subway  ride in the 
Œ in the hotel. My next recollection I think 
was mo stly in the school wh ere I could Œ wa
s way ahead of the rest of the class in 
mathematics and way behind in  understand
ing anything that wa
s going on, because 
my  Du tch  did n ™ t h e lp  me mu ch , my  E ng lish 
didn™t help me mu ch. And Œ but we Œ we 
managed. We got along fo r a couple of mont
hs. It was, I think April, May, then 
school Œ June and school wa
s out and Œ and that was that. Now, lots of things 
happened  in  between. We arrived on April 
first here in the United States. In early 
May I believe it was, the Germans overran 
Holland. And that ha
ppened so quickly 
that we did not have time, my
 parents did not have time to get my  grandparents out of 
Holland. And although we didn™t know it at
 that time, they we
re, shortly after the 
Germans walked in, they were taken on th
e train and transported to , as I finally 
learned after visiting the Holocaust memorial 
in Jerusalem, they 
lost their lives in 
Sobibor. And when  that happened, we don™t
 know. Some time in the war years. 
Whether it was early on or later on, we ju
st Œ I just don™t know. I know my  parents 
became aware of it sometime during the Œ in
 the period between1940 and 1944, that 
they were gone. Actu ally maybe Œ no,
 it was just about then, I guess.  
Q: So they lost contact with Œ 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
55
Q: Œ your grandparents right away? 
A: Yes, as soon as the Germans were in, 
that was almost impo
ssible to communicate. 
There was still some correspond
ence coming through beca
use he Œ America was not 
at war with Germany. So you could still get 
some mail and they di
d, I think, until the 
Œ until the war broke out in 
1941. So there was still some
 correspondence for a period 
of time and then after that. So it must have b
een in either 1942 or
 ™43 that they were 
grabbed with all the other Je
ws who were in Holland and 
deported. My brother and I 
were sent to summer camp in the United St
ates and shortly after we Œ that summer, 

the year that we arrived, we went to 
the YMHA camp. Funny. And it was Surprise 
Lake camp was the name of it. As it turn
s out, Anita, who I™m married to right now 
also went to that camp. Of course, we di
dn™t know each other 
then. She was younger 
than I. But Œ  

Q: Was it in the country? 

A: Yes, it was in the country,
 and Œ Cold Springs, is it
? Or something like that. And 
they left us there in Œ wh
ere the Œ for Œ for I guess six 
weeks, for the summertime. 
And we were old enough at that time not to
 object to being w
ithout our parents, I 
guess. And we Œ and I guess two or three 
weeks after summer  camp started, they 
came up to visit us. And they came and they
 went to our counselor and they  said, 
how are the boys doing? And the counselo
r said well, what do you mean how are 
they doing? They™re fine. No
, that™s not what we mean, 
I mean how are they getting

along with the other children? He said 
they get along okay. Well but, my  parents 
said, they don™t speak English. And th e coun
selor said, of course 
they speak English. 
He never knew that we couldn™t speak 
English. And within a matter of literally 
weeks, we learned enough, learned Englis
h sufficiently so that
 no Œ nobody ever 
knew that we didn™t sp Œ that we were
n™t English speaking to
 begin with. And I 
always feel that such submersion for young 
people is probably  the best way to learn a 
language. It really is. 
Q: So you didn™t have a German
 accent or anything like that? 
A: No, no, no accent. Well, I Œ certainly no
t a German accent. Well, I think one of 
the reasons that we picked up th e language
 was Œ so quick ly was because we moved 

from Germany to Ho lland, we learned Du tc
h in a relatively short period of time 
because Dutch is also very 
similar to German. But Dutch 
also has a huge number of 
English words in its language
. So the transition 
was an easy one. Go from German to 
Dutch to English. It was quite easy, at l
east for me and I think it help ed enormously  
to Œ to have that progression. So here we
 were in the United States and we could 
speak English and shortly afte
r that summer my parents Œ  
Q: Were there other immigrant children in the camp? 

A: No, not that I know of. Oh
, there may have been, but I didn™t know about it. I had 
no Œ no knowledge of it.

Q: Di-Did you tell the other children where 
you were born and some of the things 
you had lived through? 
A: Don™t rememb er recalling or saying anyt
hing to th em. My brother and I were in 
the same b u nk. We spoke to each other, obvi
ously  and we just kept our ears open to 
what was going on and what was being said. 

Q: In German you sp oke to each other? 

A: No, no, in Œ in th
e bunk, in here. Th Œ in German
, I Œ no, we spoke Dutch. If we 
did speak, we spoke Du tch. We
 didn™t want to speak German. 
Q: Why not? 

A: Ger Œ Germans were anathema in the Un
ited States at that time and we didn™t 
want to have the kind of discrimination 
experienced against us because we were 
German and German speaking. We wanted 
Œ we didn™t want anything to  do with 

Germans. Germans were a pariah and we didn
™t want to be part of the pariah. If 
people noticed that we spoke German, they might take offense. 
Q: That™s quite sophisticated for a nine year old. 
A: Not if you™re accustomed to 
Œ not if you™ve been accustom
ed to having that sort of 
thing done to you as a Jew in Germany. 
You were accustomed to it. You would know 
that if you were just different than anybody
 else, if you wa Œ if you were different, 
you better be somebody diffe
rent who everybody liked, 
not somebody different 
whom Œ whom everybody despised. So  bei
ng Germans was not on the top of our list, 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

58
but we spoke Du tch, and th at was okay. Se
e, Holland was still very friendly, they 
weren't tain ted with Nazi persona, so we 
said okay, we Œ we 
were speaking Du tch, 
and that was at that time our major la
nguage. We came back from camp  Œ because 
my  parents didn™t speak Du tch at home an
d we no longer spoke Du tch, we spoke 
English at that time. W e promptly dropped
 Dutch and now I recall very, very little of 
Dutch. Very little. I™ve been ba
ck several times. I can pr
obably read some of it and 
understand a little, but I don™t speak it at allth e way I did as a child when I was very, 
very fluent in it. But German, strange
ly  enough, being the mo ther tongue, I 
remember and I can understa
nd it. So that was that. 
Q: So they you came back
 after the summer and you 
started school again?  
A: Yes. By that time my pare
nts had moved to Forest Hills. 
Q: Queens? 
A: Queens. And Œ an apartment there and 
we went to school there. I guess it was 
there, for the first time in 
America that I experienced th
at anti-Semitism was not a 
phenomenon that afflicted Europe alone. B
ecause we were in the Œ I guess the third 
grade in the school, public school
 in Forest Hills. Very love
ly  school, P.S. three. And 
I reme mb er that it mu st have been one of
 the national holidays and my  parents had 
pinned an American flag to
 my  lapel and my  brother™s lapel and we went off to 
school. And I™ll never forget it, but the te
acher, knowing that we were immigrants, 
had made a remark that you shouldn™t be 
wearing that flag, you are not really

Americans, or what have you. Somethi
ng along those lines. And my  mo ther took 
tremendous offense, she went to school and really Œ she was a very outsp oken 

woman, and she was quite outspoken ab out th
at sort of thing and said so. But more 
than that, during our growi
ng up years here, we had occasi
on to go with our parents. 
When we were a little bit older we went on
 holiday with them. 
And one of the trips 
that we took was up 
to the Adirondacks.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holo caust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with Alfred Schnog. This
 is tape number three, side A, and you 
were going up to  the Ad irondack s with your family. 
A: My parents had arranged to rent a cabi
n on Trout Lake, near Bolton Landing in  Œ 
in the Lake George region of the Adironda
cks. And th ey had packed  provisions to 
take up with them, put them in
 the car and we headed up 
north. And wh en we arrived 
at the cabin it was truly a horrible place
. The place was overrun with bugs. The 
mattresses were rotten and it was the kind of 
place that it would ha
ve been difficult to 
stay at in any circumstances. So my  mo ther 
said, I don™t care what we have with us Œ 
and in those days we didn™t have such great 
refrigeration, so we said we Œ we™ll just 
have to go find someplace else
 to stay. They didn™t real
ize is that every place there 
was jam packed and during
 the summer you couldn™t find
 a place. What we didn™t 
realize til w e saw it were the restricted si
gns. And there were Œ 
came in any number 
of forms. There were either just plain re
stricted, a sign that said restricted, which 
everybody knew meant no Jews, or churches
 nearby which mean
t essentially the 
same thing. And it came as a Œ a surprise to
 me, or perhaps not as a surprise because 
of what we™d been 
th ro ugh. Bu t my  parents managed to ignore those things and live 
with it and possibly they could ignore it be
cause they had so mu
ch experience in 
Germany ignoring it. But it left its mark. 
Certainly left its mark on me, that anti-

61
Semitism in whatever form, pe
rhaps not as virulent as it 
was in Germany could exist 
anywhere, and indeed , it does ex
ist almost everywhere. So Œ 
Q: When  did you take this
 trip the Adirondacks? 
A: When ? Do to  the Œ I Œ this mu st have be
en in Œ I mu st have Œ I was Œ I was older.  
Q: Was it still during the war? 
A: Oh yes. It was still during th e war. We
 had saved gasoline coupons and whatever 
to Œ to make it, because gasoline was seve
rely rationed during the war. I think I must 
have been ab out 14 years old 
at the time, which would have
 been in  1900 and Œ well, 
maybe 13 or four Œ 1945 Œ ™44 
- ™45, in th at Œ in that period of time. I think maybe in 
Œ I must have been 13 at the time, I™m pr
etty sure it was. And we Œ we traveled 
around trying to  find a place to stay, and 
not because of the restricted signs we 
couldn™t stay, it was just simply they we
re full, couldn™t take anybody. And we 
wound up at a Œ right opposite 
where we had rented this cabin at a Œ at a Œ turned out 
to be a Jewish camp, summer camp. And we 
walked in, the camp hadn™t started yet, 
but the owners were there and my  parents 
asked wh ether they could stay there over 
the ni Œ overnight and th ey said oh, stay 
as long as you like. Th
ey saw two boys and 
obviously it was Œ they could sign up two 
camp ers, which indeed  they did, so we 
wound up sp ending our summers there for th
e next four or five years and it was 
wonderful experience for us, and a nice part 
of the country and we got to know a lot 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

62
of interesting people and made a lot of frien
ds, some of whom I still see today, and Œ 
went to camp with us. 
Q: What was the name of your camp? 
A: Camp  Œ  n ame was Camp  Wald man  and  I 
don™t think it exists today. I think it™s 
been sold , I don™t know who owns it or
 what. But the owner was a fellow named 
Charlie Garland who lived in Glens Falls, 
he was a baker. And th
ey were wonderful 
people, very friendly and so  here was this 
really strange combination of anti-Semitic 
signs on the roads going up to Lake Geor
ge, and here this tr
emendous welcoming o-
of a camp that it was run by Jews and ob
viously these people were ex tremely well 
accepted in their community, because we got
 to know them quite well, they were 
known all over the area. So all these things
 happened to gether and i-i-it was a strange 
mixture, really, and it Œ it -- it puzzled me 
at the time and it still puzzles me today, 
how these two things can coexist.  

Q: Speaking about being 13 or 14, 
did you and your brother have a Bar
-
Mitzvah? 
A: Yes, we were Œ 

Q: Could you tell a li Œ a little bit about that? 

A: Oh yes. When  my Œ when  we moved in  
here and we became Œ we were 11 or 12 
years old, my  parents said, well boys, you Œ 
you know, you have to
 think ab out your 
Bar-Mitzvah, and we went to a Jewish s
ynagogue in Rego Park. Today it™s a very 

large synagogue, at that time it was a sm
all shul, veryOrthod
ox and we went to

Sunday school, and we Œ and Hebrew scho
ol and like ev ery go
od American boy we 
hated it. Despised it. In fact we Œ we spen t our time doing mischief rather than paying 
attention to the class. I remember sticking 
a girl™s bobby pin in th e light sock et and 
blowing out the lights in the whole place, in
 the synagogue. But it was Œ and no Œ and 
what amazed me most was the teacher came
 over to me, are you okay? She was more 
concerned about me than I 
wa Œ she thought something ha
d blown out of the wall, 
you know. Aft Œ and I was tota
lly responsib le for the whole thing. Bu t, it was about 
that time th at my father learned about the 
death of our Œ of my  
grandparents. And he, 
having been  brought up very  religiously, he
 went every mo rning and every night to Œ 
to the minyan to Œ to  the shul, and No rb
ert and I accomp anied him. We went ev ery 
single day with him for that Œ for that y
ear of mo rning. And we learned our Bar-
Mitzvah lessons and had a Œ went
 through a regular Bar-Mitzvah
 
at that shul. It was a 
very nice time, we an Œ we loved the day,
 we loved being ther
e, we loved Œ you 
know, when you™re Œ when you  go through a Bar-Mitzvah, 
it™s a w o nderful thing for 
a child. It™s a Œ it™s n Œ the learning and the 
stepping up to it is ho
rrible, you hate it, 
every minute of it. But when  the day arrive
s and you manage your
 way through it, the 
pride that you feel, and the Œ is exhilara
ting. And we Œ we re
ally did enjoy that 
immensely. 

Q: Was it hard for you to go through it w
ithout your grandparen
ts and knowing wh at 
happened  to  your grandparents?  

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
64
A: I don™t think I gave it very much though t. It may have been very hard for my 
parents to realize that this was happeningwithout their parents being there, but we 

had accepted the death of the 
grandparents and didn™t even 
think about the fact that 
they weren™t there, or Œ we 
didn't look back . I think th at
™s more of an adult thing. 
You Œ you do th at when  you have mo re [i
ndecipherable] we were more concerned 
about how well we would do in  reciting the 
Haftorah and the Torah portions and how 
Œ and wh at might happen afterwards because
 we had Œ all my  parents friends would 
come over to the house afterwards and we 
would be on display, obviously  for them 
and Œ and we™d have to rec
ite the blessings before the meals and the Œ and after the 
meal and all of this, which was important to
 our parents that we know those things, 
and Œ you know, and we did know them
 and have long since forgotten. 
Q: Were you very  devastated when  you  found out about your gran dparents? 
A: Well, we Œ I had very fond memories of 
my  grandparents and yes, I was Œ I can™t 
say that it was devastating, it was a lo
ss. And I™ve thought about it many times, you 
miss them. But it was 
probably the f Œ the first time 
that Œ you know
, there was so 
mu ch death that you heard about in those 
days, so many stories of how people died. 
And by that time we w ere old enough to 
understand, and to know that this was 
happening. And so it wasn™t a Œ a total surp
rise and it wasn™t totally devastating. You 
sort of knew that they were
 going to be caught up in it and that was that. I Œ I Œ I 
reme mb er that we Œ none of
 us held out hope that they
 would ever get out. Perhaps

65
we hoped because they were in Holland that
 they somehow might be safe from the Œ 
from what was happening in Germany. But it
 was just a hope, and didn™t turn out to 
be the case, and that wasn™t all too surp
rising, because we ha
d Œ we had heard of 
other case, of other people in Holland who 
had lost their lives, who™d been  sent to 
concen tration camps and were 
no Œ no longer alive. Not 
just that, but people had 
committed suicide because of 
the struggles they were go
ing th rough and they  just 
couldn™t live with it any longer. Th
ere were many who did that.  
Q: Did your parents keep in
 touch with other relatives? 
A: Yes, they did, they kept in touch with 
those relatives they had, we had. There were 
Œ we had Œ my  father had some relatives 
who had moved to Ho lla
nd as well, who had 
managed to escape because they were Œ had 
become Dutch citizens,
 they escaped to 
Aruba and Curacao and still live there. And it™
s quite a large family  that™s down there 
and they ™v e done very  well. They Œ I thin
k they own th e agency  to distribute Toyota 

cars on those islands. Nice people, I™ve met 
some of them. We haven™t been down  
there but we™ve Œ they™ve been in New Yo
rk and when  I Œ certainly if I go down  
there, the name Schnog will be all over the 
island, as it is, you know. So yes, we™ve 
managed to keep in Œ somewhat 
in touch with those relatives. 
Q: So now you™re a teenage
r, did you have many American
 friends, were you totally 
accepted, except for that teacher 
who commented about the flag? 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
66
A: Oh, no, we never had any 
trouble with that, our Œ ourŒ many of our teachers were 
Jewish themselves an d at that stage 
nobody knew any longer that we were 
immigrants. We spoke English without too 
much of a trace of an accent. And we 
were good students, we had a lot of friends
, very close friends. And wa Œ I guess we 

were almost normal teenagers that time, we
 Œ I don™t remember Œ I remember that I 
did very well in school, I loved my teachers.
 I think the next mo st troubling th ing in 
my life was the fact that some of my teachers were involved in the McCarthy si Œ era 
situation, that thing. You 
know, when we grew
 up in those days, we were very 
liberal, almost Socialistic Œ I would say 
Socialistic. And we Œ 
a-and our teachers 
were very liberal, very bright. Well, we 
admi red them and they were Œ enormo usly. 
My math teachers, my science teachers, ther
e was Œ th-those were the classes I really 
adored , I loved them, and th e Œ and they taug
ht us so much and taught us a love for 
learning. I had a Latin teacher who I was 
very fond of, who was very fond of me 
because she passed me despite the fact that
 my brother was the 
one who did all the 
work  and I did all the copying. And Œ 
Q: Did you stay in public schools? 

A: Yes, we stayed in public school, went 
to Forest Hills High 
School and graduated 
in Forest Hills High School. A
nd then went to Œ we were 
Œ went to college, went to 
Cornell University, where we both took an
 engineering course. Wh ich was probably  
the first big mistake I made in my life, but
 nevertheless, you know
, in those days you 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

stuck with what you started and you finish
ed it. And if you ch anged, somehow it was 
an admission of failure in one direction. At
 least I perceived it that way. I was maybe 
too immature to realize otherwise. So I 
stuck with engineering and got my  degree, 
but might have been mu ch, mu ch  happ
ier in a liberal arts environment. 
Q: Le-Let™s go back a little bit. W h at was it 
like when you were 14 and a half and the 
war was over? 

A: Well, there was tremendous joy when
 th e war was over, and Œ you know, we 
joined in every celebration th
at Œ that had an ything to 
do with destr Œ destroying 
Nazism and Hitler. In every way, we just 
Œ all of America did and we were in the 
forefront of it, we did it just the same way,
 we hated this dictat
or. And we laughed at 
all the comical songs that were written at 
the time about Hitler, etcetera. And when 
the war was over Œ you know, we™d Œ we™d  Œ 
as children at that 
age, we dreamt about 
going in to th e army  and fighting. We wanted 
Œ that was Œ that was very important to 
us. We were too young and our parents prob
ably would have been
 horrified at the 
thought of it, but we™d have dreams about this
. We wanted  to be in  the army , to be a 

part of this, to fight as a soldier in Œ in
 America. Not Œ not that we had any feeling 
because we immigrated and we came from 
Germany we had to do this, but simply 
because we were patriotic Americans. Extremely patriotic, as wa
s everybody in those 
days. I mean, there were kids in our scho
ol, in our high school who lied about their 

age to get Œ to go Œ to get into
 the Marines, or to get into the army , or wh at have you. 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
68
My brother and I were very young, we look
ed young. We could 
never have passed 17 
or 18 to be able to get into 
the army , so we Œ it never dawn
ed on us even to try. But if 
the war had gone on, we woul
d have au Œ we Œ I™m sure 
we would have been in the 
forefront of volunteering to  Œ to go into it,
 and we felt it was an obligation that we 
had, to serve in America. 
So when the war was over, it wa
s quite great. We wanted to 
know all about what was Œ what had happene
d, wh ere Œ what was left in Germany. 
My parents actually went over and they saw 
what was left. This was [indecipherable] 
Q: When  Œ when  did Œ when  did they go back? 
A: They Œ shortly after the war, it was e
ither in 1940 Œ it probably  was Œ I would 
guess it was in 1946, I would guess. Might ha
ve been 1945, but 
I think that might 
have been too early. It mu st have been 
early in 1946, and Europe was devastated. 
And they went to Cologne and saw all the 
devastation that had been wrecked on the 
German cities by the contin uous bomb ing. And th ey saw Œ they  saw some of the 

people who lived there, or 
recognized them wh
en they came back. A story that my 
mother and father tell Œ told
, they went to Cologne and 
they looked up a couple who 
was Œ they had run th e grocery store, I gue
ss, there. And they 
went and asked about 
them, and they still were running a grocery st
ore. And they went over there to Œ and 
they looked in the window
 there, I guess they were running a pastry shop or 
something like that. And the wo man who ra
n the shop, and my  parents knew, looked 
out the window and saw my  mo ther and she 
turned pale. She said
, Mrs. Schnog, Frau

69
Schnog, is that you? And my mother came 
in  and said yes, it™s me, we™re back. How 
are you? Tell me, how did you surv ive? And 
they were, as my  mo ther said, very 
decent people caught up in this
 horror story with the Germ
ans, they Œ many of them 
couldn™t do anything out of fear that something would happen to them. Indeed, my  

father tells the story about a man who coul
dn™t keep his mouth shut, he says, and he 
lived in Deutz near my  grandparents. He wa
s Christian, he hated the Nazis. He let 
everybody know that these Œ Hitler and 
these Nazis would ruin Germany. And 
what™d they do? They 
caught him, they cut hi
s head off. So that ki
nd of terror visited 
on a population brings about so
 much fear, that people sh
rink away. No wonder they 
put signs in their windows, no Jews. If 
they didn™t, God knows what would have 
happened to them, in 
their own minds. So  there were a lot of Œ a lot of Germans who 
didn™t willingly participate in 
this, who did so I think out 
of fear, and what reprisals 
might be visited on them. There were some 
of course, who went right along with it, 

who Œ who thought Hitler was 
the last word and you know, 
this is Œ this is the new 
Siegfried, the Œ the hero of 
German my thology is going to  Œ th-the vag Œ the Wagner 
people, all this romanticism 
that really isn™t romanticis
m, it™s just pure Germanic. 
And those are the ones who H
itler really appealed to. 
Q: How Œ when  did you become a c
itizen and wh at was it like for you? 
A: Oh, interesting, yes. When my parents 
arrived here they immediately applied for 
citizenship and it was a five year waiting 
period. Five years passed and they  were 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

called before a judge and I re-rememb er going with th em before the judge an d the 
swearing in. And they were just thrilled, 
as I was, and Œ to become an American 
citizen. This was a dream that had come tr
ue for them. And shortly thereafter, we Œ 
my  brother and I became citizens by derivati
on. So we also were
 called and we were 
sworn in . And I, of co urse, have that certificate and it™s something we™re all very 

proud of, and we Œ listen, this country saved 
our lives. The fact that we got over here 
may have been pure luck, or it ma y have been  God™s doing. I don™t think it was that, I 
think it was just plain luck and a little bit of fortitude and a little bit of courage on the 
part of my  father, and seeing wh at was ha
ppening and Œ well, but to escape so many 
times from Œ slip though 
at the last  moment, a lways the la
st to arrive  before the doors 
shut, is something that amazes me. I am 
now probably  the only su rvivor of my  
immediate family because my  brother passed 
away at 54, he had pancreatic cancer 
and died. My mo ther died in
 Œ wh en she was 90 Œ 91 Œ 90 
years old. My father died 
of the Alzheimer™s disease in Œ when he
 was 84. But I often ask my self, you know, 
why am I here longer th an the other? Why 
ar Œ why aren™t there mo re of us who 
managed it? But you -- when I think ab out 
some of the stories that you read ab out 
people wh o don™t believe or who refuse to 
accept the fact that 
there was a Holocaust 
at all, it™s something that I don™t Œ I Œ 
number one, I don™t understand it. Numb er 
two, I ga Œ these are the kinds of peopl
e Œ th e kinds of people who Œ who Œ whose 
thought process is so shallow,
 the same one who Hitler was 
able to Œ to inveigle to

bring into his party. That™s Œ that™s a ho
rror and so anything th at Œ you know, history 
is something that lives only with people 
who have lived it themselves. Those that 
haven™t, except for the few who educate th
emselves, w ho will re
ad history and will 
be able to understand it, for Œ except fo
r those, people not only forg et, but it has no 
meaning for them. They read a history b
ook. There was World War II, it lasted  from 
this date to that date. This is what s 
Œ took place, but it means nothing. It means 
absolutely nothing. Wh
en I was a child I talked to my  grandfather and I asked him 
about World Wa r I. My grandfather served 
in the German army in World War I, and 
he told me stories. He told me the story 
one day of an airp lane that came and dropped 
two bombs in Cologne, and I was impresse
d. But Wo rld War I had no meaning to 
me. Not from what was relayed to me. It 
meant nothing. World War II, yes, had 
every meaning. I was too closely in volved
. You know, look at 
our children today. 
They look back and they come
 to me and they want to 
know a little bit about World 
War II, I can tell them certain things ab
out World War II, but it won™t have any 
meaning for them. They are much closer to th
e last war we fought in, the desert or in 
perhaps Vietnam if th ey™re a little older and 
went through that er
a. But even that 
passes, and if they don™t info
rm themselves and don™t reach
 back and read the history 
and in Œ get involved a little 
bit more closely into what 
Œ perhaps into people™s lives, 
or into Œ there have been
 some wonderful books writte
n about World War II. If they 
don™t read that, or if they Œ if you have
n™t read ﬁAll Qu iet on the Western Front,ﬂ you

would not really understand the abhorrence 
of war that came out of World War I. 
And I think that™s mi ssing today and mu ch  of 
that is missing and it™s too bad, it really 
is and I think th is is the kind of thing th
at fosters the thoughts that the Ho locaust 
never happened. And it sure did. There 
was one other vignette that™s rather 
interesting. A few years ago, here in Amer
ica, my  parents were living in Florida and 
my  mo ther Œ I came down to  Florid a to go 
to attend an affair of some sort. I™ve 
forgotten whether it was a formal affair or
 whether we were just going out for Œ for 
dinner. And I was over at her apartment, we
 were chatting and I was getting dressed. 

I was staying with her. And I 
had forgotten to bring my  
cufflinks. And I said, Mom, 
you know, I don™t have any 
cufflinks, did Dad have any? And she said yeah, yeah, 
wait a minute, I have something for you. 
And she brought out a pair of silver 
cufflinks. She said these Œ these will do fine
. And I looked at them and I said, yes 
they will, where™d Dad get these? She said, we
ll, it™s an interesting story, I have to 
tell you about it. And sh e said, when your
 fath er was young, about to be Bar-
Mitzvahed, 13 years old, there was a Œ your 
grandfather, Arnold, rented a room in his 

house to a German soldier, an officer. A
nd he used that room to entertain his 
girlfriend. And he was a very nice gentlema
n and he knew  your 
father was being Bar-
Mitzvahed, so he purchased those cufflinks
 for your father as a Bar-Mitzvah gift. 
And, she said to me, you™d be in terested in
 knowing the name of that German officer. 
And I said, yeah, well who was he? She sa
id, his name was von Stauffenberg. And I 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

73
star Œ I was startled; von Stauffenberg 
was the general who took part in the 
assassination attempt against Hitler in the la
tter stages of the war. So history touches 
you, no matter where you are, at one point or
 another, and here in a pair of cufflinks, 
it reaches back and it touches you. And it™s 
these kinds of stories that make history 
alive. I hope I can pass all these th ings on 
to my children that th
ey™ll remember it. I 
don™t know whether I Œ I have my self been
 back to Germany on several occasions. 
I™ve been th ere on business and I™ve met pe
ople in Germany. And you can™t help, 
when  you meet one of the older generati
on, my  generation, you can™t help but 
wonder where they were in those years betw
een ™38 an d ™44, wh at
 they were doing, 
whether they took part in a
ny of the atrocities that were
 visited on the Jews. But you 
hesitate to ask. Maybe my 
parents weren™t so afraid. 
Maybe they did ask, a few 
times. But I™ve never asked. I™ve met some
 of the younger people and th ey don™t 
really have a recollection of it, and in
 that case perhaps it™s good for them, for 

Germany. One of the interesting trips that 
we recently took, we went a cruise and 
wound up Œ up in the Œ in th
e Baltic. And we would up in
 Rostock. And there they 
had a bus trip to Berlin. Well, for the peopl
e who were on the cruise, and there were a 
group of Jewish people on the cruise w
ho wanted to s Œ particularly see the 
synagogue in Berlin. My wife and I didn™t 
have an overriding in terest to do that, but 
they need ed  to gath er enough people togeth
er to Œ to put a busload  togeth er and we 
volunteered to join them. And 
so we went into Berlin.

End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with Alfred Schnog. This
 is tape number three, side B and you 
were on this trip going into Berlin. 
A: Right. So, as I say, we volunteered to go
 along with them, and we went into Berlin 
and we had a German guide
, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us 
around and showed us the highlights in Be
rlin and the to ur. And th e tour a Œ th e 
centerpiece of the tour was goi
ng to see Checkpoint Charlie, 
and what used to be East 
Germany and the wall, this sm
all section that they preser
ved fo r histo Œ fo r history. 
And very little was remembered
 by the guide of Œ or was told to any of us about 
World War II and wh at happened in Berlin 
during that period of time, period of 
years. It was interestin g observation for 
me, because the young Germans were mo re Œ 
mu ch mo re affected, and understandably so
, by th e separ Œ the Œ the separation of 
east and the Œ Germany and West Germa
ny and th e hardships that the eastern 
Germany Œ Germans experienced, and the fa
ct that they were separated from their 
families an d couldn™t see each other, and th
e Œ the wall and the suicides that resulted 
from that, or people who were killed trying 
to escape. And this wa
s foremost in their 
minds, this was how horrible things were dur
ing those years. They
 didn™t look back 
to World War II and wh
at happened then . That was not part of their being, their

substance, their Œ their memo ry, and Œ exce
pt for one in stance, which I found highly 
interesting. She told us, the 
guide, that she was taking us to
 the university in Berlin. 
And we got out and there was this very la
rge square, quadrangle in the center of the 
university. And we marched out to the middle 
of this square and mo stly cobblestones 
and in th e middle was a square. I don™t kno
w, I would say it was the size of, oh, 
maybe three meters by three meters, so about
 Œ roughly about thr 
Œ a little more than 
three yards by th ree yards square, and glass,
 right in th e ground. You kn Œ you know, 
it was part of the Œ the ground, it wa Œ it 
wasn™t raised in any fashion. And she 
gathered everybody around this glass squa
re that was cut into
 the ground and she 
said, would you please look down and tell 
me what you see? A
nd we looked down 
and what we could see under the glass we
re empty bookcases around the square and 
she asked whether we knew wh at
 that was. And of course 
being all Jews, many of us 
did know exactly what it was. It™s a re
presentation and a memorial o f the book 
burning, where the Nazis had burned all the b
ooks. An Œ and that that would be there 
in Œ at the University of Berlin, well I t
hought was extremely interesting. The fact 
that she knew about it and that she was w illi ng to tell us about 
it, even though it was 
not on her tour and th at she wa
sn™t expected to show us th
is, was very interesting for 
us. Then  we wound up Œ wh ich they clearly 
avoided because they saved it for the last 
part of the day, we wound 
up at the Jewish synagogue there, which was burned by 
the Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, an
d Œ and restored. Now 
it™s no longer being

used as a synagogue cause it 
was violated as religious gr
ound. But we stood outside. 
There™s a mu seum right next door to it wh
ere we could go in fo r a few minutes and 
see what there was, we really didn™t have
 much time. But there were two plaques on 
the outside of the synagogue explaining wh
at had happen ed and how it was restored, 
etcetera. And most of my fellow cruise memb
ers couldn™t read German etcetera, so I 
wound up being the one who read
 the plaques for them and translated it for them, and 
they were quite moved by it. And I was please
d to be able to open their eyes to this 
and to be able to read them
. Now I think they were, stra
n g ely enough, more affected 
by it than I was, because I had been through 
it, I had seen it. I think it was more of a 
shock to mo st of these people this actua
lly happened an d that this is where it took 
place and these are the Œ the memorials to it. 
So I Œ I found that trip very enlightening 
and I guess mo re so from the point of youth
 that the Germans today are, just like 
everybody else in the 
world, they are obsessed with th
e history of today and not with 
the history of yesterday.

A: Well, I was an engineering student an
d I had at that time Œ during my  time at 
college, the Korean war broke out. And we Œ 
obviously we wanted  to f Œ at that time 
finish our education, so we
 joined the ROTC program at
 college. And we finished 
our engineering degree and gr
aduated as lieutenants in 
the United States Army and 
went right away into service. We had an 
obligation to serve at least two years of 
active duty, at which time Œ 
Q: This is 1953? 
A: This was 1953. ™54, actually. And we Œ we
 thought we might be able to get a nice 
plush assignment, maybe go to Japan, wh ich 
was very interesting, or I thought, my 
goodness, you know, I™m fluent in German, 
maybe they  could send me to Germany, 
you know, I could Œ would be
 a wo nderful opportunity . Well, of course the United 
States Army doesn™t think in those terms. No
r did they  know or did they think in  the 
terms that I was an engineer, a graduate, th
ey could have put me
 into any number of 
positions where that w
ould have been useful. No, I wa
s in the ordinance corps and I 
was going to  be Œ and I had th
at Œ you know, they had all 
these electronic things, they 
could have easily put me into that and he
lped, but no, no, I™m 
going to Ko rea and 
that™s that. So off we went, my brother 
and I both went to Ko rea. Fortunately we 
went shortly after Eisenhower had made his 
historic visit to Ko rea and the war was Œ 
the fighting had stopped. And we were ther
e just shortly afterw
ards. So the country 
was extremely poor, Ko rea, and it wa Œ had 
been destroyed and we
 wound up at the Œ

at an army depot near Inch
eon, [indecipherable] city. I™
ve since been back and you 
can™t recognize it any more, 
the country has boomed econ
omically and Œ of course 
not in North Korea, but at least in Sout
h Korea it has. And we spen t Œ I spent two 
years there. My brother was 
statio ned up on the DMZ, th
e demilitarized zone at the 
time, and we™d see each other occasionally, I 
would fly up with friends of mines who 
were pilots and Œ and in Œ in th e army . 
They  would fly me up in these sal Œ small 
planes and I™d visit him or -- and he would 
return the visit. Some
times we™d Œ got our 
Jeeps and drove up th rough these rutted road
s and dust and Œ and it was a Œ it was a 
boring ex istence cause there was nothing to
 do, and Korea was cold and miserable. 
The rats were the size of Œ well, pigs. 
They  were huge, and you™d live with them. 
There were a lot of Œ there were a lot of 
people who had been displaced by the war, a 
lot of orphans in orphanages, wh ich you 
know, just tore your heart out. And as 
soldiers and as officers, we did what we
 could to help  out these orphanag es. We 
collected from our troops and from the re Œ 
other officers to help these people, and 
they were very grateful, they were Œ for ev
erything that we could do there. They ™re a 
tough people, the Koreans, th
ey really are and they manage to survive. But it Œ you 
really Œ it was not the kind of service that
 I expected in the United States Army. I 
expected, you know, World War II, you™re goi
ng to  go out, fight, right? But no, no, 
no, nothing like that. Met a lot of people 
and learned a little bit about the average 
American, and how mu ch Œ how important 
the average American is to America™s

life, and how basically good th
ey are, despite Œ da Œ it does
n™t matter what their level 
of education is. It really didn™t matter and th
ere were people Œ I was Œ one of the jobs 
that was assigned to  me, I was a commande
r of a depot supply co mp any there and 
one of the other jobs I had wa
s to Œ was for the education, I was the education officer 
for the battalion and we had many, many se
rgeants, people who had work ed th eir 
way up th rough the ranks, who barely had an
 education above a grade school level. 
And we furnished them with additional Œ with Œ with  schools and tried to bring them 
and as well as many of the Œ the enlisted me
n up to at least a grade level or a high 
school level education. But it didn™t matt
er how educated they were, they were 
basically very, very good pe
ople, very honest people. I had a group of sergeants who 
I got along with extremely, extremely well. 
They  did things for me Œ at that time 
there was absolutely no acco
untability for supplies in th
e United States Army. And 
when  I was Œ wh en I signed Œ when  I to
ok over the command of my  comp any, I 
signed off on th ings I didn™t know I had, 
or didn™t know existed and Œ and wh en it 
finally came time for me to turn
 the comp any over to the next officer that would take 
over, I had to do a Œ an inventory really, wh
at th Œ wh at the heck did we have and 

what did I sign fo r, and you know, I™m respon
sible for this, have to sign it back . And 
there were Œ there was a Jeep in there that I remember that I neve
r even knew existed. 
And Œ and we had Œ and 
we had some things that we ha
d so much in excess of that it 
shouldn™t have been there, but I se Œ I said
 to one of my  sergeants, I Œ wh at Œ wh at

are we going to do about this
, or where™s this Jeep? He sa
id oh please lieutenant, he 
said, don™t worry about it, just bring th e g
uy over tomo rrow mo rn ing, we™ll take care 
of it. So in the morning I 
came over with a new officer a
nd I introduced him to my  
staff and I said okay, would you Œ h-here 
is our inventory, would you sign off on it 
please? And we start looking around and when
 he checked it off and we went outside 

and there is this Jeep sitting there and I 
look at the inventory list and the serial 
number, everything is just exactly the wa
y it should be. And I said hm, I guess it 
must have been somewhere, but Œ and the 
fellow signed off and everything was just 
perfect. And when he left I pulled out a 
bottle that I had there and I said, look 
gentlemen, the s Œ the sergeants Œ well, you 
know, I guess this is goodbye. I want you 
to have a drink and Œ and 
we exchanged pleasantries, 
had a drink and I said, now 
wait a minute sergeant, I said, where the hell™
d that Jeep come from? And he said sir, 
he said, in about five minutes we have to 
return it to battalion A, and we™ve got to 
repaint the thing. So it™s that kind of 
thing. Everybody would 
help everybody out.  
Q: Di-Did putting on an Am
erican army uniform bring back any memories of 

German uniforms? 

A: No, not at all, not at all. The way I 
saw and perceived the Germans were almost 
like the Œ theatrical costumes, theatrical pe
ople. They were so 
outlandish in their 
style of dress with their epaulets and thei
r Œ and th eir polished boots and their Œ you 

know, you don™t get this in the United States
 Army. I hope not, I 
hope we never will. 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

81
And it did not, it did n Œ I Œ I Œ I never even
 thought of it in 
that fashion, never 
equated my service in the army with what 
Œ what I saw in Germany, never. So then 
we were finished with our service in th
e army after 14 months, came back to the 
United States and I at that stage had a choi
ce to make in my career as to whether I 
wanted to be an engineer for the rest of my
 life, or whether I wanted to try something 
else. And I knew Œ had known really all al
ong that engineering was not my  calling. 
And I s Œ I said, well you know, it™s somethingI can always go back to. But I went to 
see my  father and I said dad, you know, ca
n you get me a job w
ith your company? I 
want to get into sales or so
mething wh ere I deal with people. And just to see whether 
I like that. I can always go b
ack to engineering. And he 
said sure, and he got me a 
job. I essentially went to 
work for my fathe
r™s comp any. My brother, who graduated 
Cornell as an electrical engineer as I did, wa
s pretty close to being top in  his class. I Œ 
I was, I guess, the goof off and he was the 
one who a-applied himself. Not only  did 
he apply himself, he had a 
calling for engineering. He wa
s a lot like my father, my 
father always wanted to be an engineer
 and never had the op
portunity. My brother 
had the opportunity and made the mo st of 
it. He immediately went to wo rk as an 
engineer wh en he got out of the army  and 
wound up in the Œ in
 the optics field in 
engineering. Interestingly e
nough, one of the highlights of his career was that he 
testified before Congress. Malcolm Wallop™s committee, which at the time was 

looking into the feasibility 
of space and using space for military purposes. And my 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
82
brother, along with four other engineers, or 
three other engineers, I guess, were called 
before the committee to testify. They
 were known as the Gang of Four. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I have a book that actually states th
at. And I think he had 
a lot to do at that 
time in persuading Ronald Reag
an to go ahead w
ith his space mi ssil e programs. So 
here you have a young man 
who was brought up in  Germany, who escaped with  his 
life testifying before Congress,
 I think it™s amazing, and Œ 
that he accomplished all of 
that. He was instrumental in designing the 
mirrors and the optics for the first sp ace Œ 
astronomical space obs Œ observatory, which they  shot up into sp ace, it worked  very  

well. He was working on th e Hubble when  he
 died and my  nephews and nieces say, 
you know, if Norbert had been around to
 finish  that job w
ith everybody, they 
wouldn™t have had th e trouble they did w
ith the Hubble. Well, 
you know, that may 
be, it may not be, who knows,
 but he Œ he spent his career doing that and was quite, 

quite proud of it, and he should have been. 
Q: Did you keep up a close relati
onship as you all became adults? 
A: We kept up a relationship. Was it close?
 My brother and I are totally different 
personalities Œ we were. And it was difficult fo
r him to express his inner thoughts and 
to open up to people. And I th
ink also difficult for him to 
open up his feelings toward 
me, or with me. We certainly kept up cont
acts through all those years. His children 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
83
are now as close to me as my own children 
are, particularly his son, who I think has 
more in common with me th
an my own son. Their Œ  
Q: Did you used to Œ 
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: Œ did you used to talk about your earl
y childhood when  you were adults, about 

what you boys went through?  

A: Not terribly mu ch , no. I think he had hi
s recollections and I had mine. No, I don™t 
think so. We Œ mo re Œ we kept up mo re with
 the kinds of things 
that happened later 
in our lives when we came to America. 
Our camp experiences and the time there, 
let™s say, perhaps the Œ some of the years th
at we spent in the ar
my together. Not so 
much as to what happened 
in Germany and Œ and in Œ 
in Holland prior years.  
Q: So you went to 
work for your father? 
A: Went to work , yes. 

Q: And did you stay in 
the long Œ a long time? 
A: I worked for my father a
nd we Œ I was stationed up in 
Boston for awhile learning 
how to become a steel scrap trader. And it 
was very difficult. I had problems dealing 
with New Englanders because they were so
 difficult to talk w
ith, you know, they 
didn't  open up. I Œ I think one of the thin
gs I learned there was that sometimes it™s 
good to keep you
r mouth shut. I never forget the time I h ad to persuade a New 
England scrap dealer to sell me a carload of
 scrap, because we were going to  ship  it 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
84
off to Œ on a ship com Œ saili
ng out of Boston. And he was selling all his scrap to a 
competitor. And so I went in to see hi
m Œ Leroy was his name. And I said Œ I 
introduced myself and I told
 him who I worked for and I 
said, I™d like to buy your 
scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is 
what I want, this is what I™m ready to pay 
for it and I really would like to start and I 
hope you can give us a chance, and wh at 
have you. And then  I had ma
de my pitch, I said, what 
do you th ink? And he didn™t 
answer. He just sat there. And for awhile
 I said to myself, well, should I say 
something, or shouldn™t I? And I said, you 
know, I™ve just said everything th at I need 
to say. If he™s not going to reply to me, ju
st keep your mouth shut, sit. For once in 
your lifetime, don™t say anything. So I sat th
ere what was an interminable amount of 
time and I don™t know how long it was, maybe 
four or five minutes or so, which is 

ridiculous, you know, you™re
 sitting there and you™re wond
ering what you™re going to 
do, and beginning to  sweat. Should I get up
 and leave, wh at? And he suddenly said, 
yup, okay . Now, I don™t know what he 
was thinking about, I have no id ea. And I 
won™t ever question it. But that was that, I sa
id thank you and I left and I sent him the 
order and th at was that. So I learned a lot 
from that experience. 
I stayed with that 
company, I wasn™t happy there in New En
gland, and moved back
 to New York and 
met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly ma
n, was my father™s partner for some 
years. And we Œ and I got into  the import and 
export business in Œ in Œ in steel. I t was 
in the new steel business. And in 1962 he
 retired from the comp
any. And I know he 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
85
was Œ he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. He was in his 70™s, but 
wanted to  continue to work , wh ich is very 
interesting because I feel exactly the same 
way today and I™m probably  about the same 
age he was when  he 
retired. And so, with 
my father™s help, I spoke w
ith Ben Livingston and we put togeth er three people and 
we said, let™s go out in business and start the busin ess. And I figured that Ben 

Livingston had a good re
putation in the field. If he st
ayed active in the business for 
just three years, we™d have 
enough grounding in order to be able to Œ to run the 
busin ess without him. Well, we did. We we
nt out, found a small office in the Lincoln 
build ing in New Yo rk and went
 to work with three of us
, myself, an associate of 
mine and Ben Livingston, the younger a
ssociate. And we started to build  the 
company. And in three year
s Ben Livingston showed  no signs of retiring and he was 
as Œ he™s Œ he was Œ h-he lived until he 
was 89 years old. He came into the office 

every single day. He was no longer active in
 the daily trading, but he became a very 
close friend of mine and we were able to 
talk to each other and pass information back 
and forth f-for Œ for many years. We Œ I fi
nally took over as th
e president of the 
company and it was extremely successful, it 
worked out quite well.
 Into Œ one of the 
interesting incidents I™ll never forget with 
Ben Livingston, he was in his 80™s already 
and found it difficult to get around. He was 
using a cane. He was a big man, heavy, 
and he would start losing so me of his agility. 
And I was in the office talking to him, I 
was going to  take a trip to Argentina, a 
business trip and I sat down and I told  him 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
86
what I was going to do, and how we were 
going to get around, we had a problem 
there, and discussed the problem with hi
m and how best to solve it. Suddenly th e 
lights went out in th e building and we were on the Œ th at time on the 21
st
 floor of the 
Lincoln building. And I said 
okay, let™s sit around, let™s 
see what happens. And half 

an hour passed and th e lights didn™t co
me back on. And I said, you know, 
something™s going on. We called up and we
 found out the whole east coast was 
blacked out. I don™t know whet
her you rememb er the big blackout. And I said Ben, I 
don™t know whether we™re going to get home. 
The trains aren™t running, ev erything is 
closed down. I just made a telephone call, th
e whole east coast is blacked out. I don™t 
Œ can™t Œ don™t think I can leave you here. A
nd he said well, you know something, I Œ 
if you™ll help me I Œ let™s go up to my  cl
ub. He was a me mo ry of the Harmony Club 
up on Fifth Avenue, wh ich was up on 60
th
 Street. And I said, all rig h t, come on, I™ll 
help you. And we Œ poor fellow, he walked 
down 21 flights of stairs with his cane, 
and we started walking uptown. It was 
an extraordin ary night. You know, people 
didn™t know what was happening, it was th
e height of the Cold
 War, people thought 
that the Russians were  sending missile
s over and bombing Amer
ica and we were 
going to  be attacked any mo ment, and ther
e were all kinds of fears everywhere. 
People were praying, it was just unbelievabl
e what was happening in New York  City. 
And we were walking up Fifth 
Avenue, straight up Fifth 
Avenue. And Ben got pretty 
tired. We were up near 50
th
 Street and he was kind of 
exhausted by this time, and 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
87
there was Saint Patrick™s Cathedral right ther
e next to us. And I said Ben, you know, 
why don™t we go inside and sit down, you 
know, you can use a spell of rest, and I Œ 
and he said you know Al, that™s
 a good idea, let™s go. So 
we went to Saint Patrick™s 
cathe Œ Cathedral, which was amazing. 
It was lit up by candles and people, you 
know, they were afra
id, they didn™t know what was ha
ppening and they were pray ing 
and i-it was an extraordinary sight. And we
 sat down, we just sat and relaxed fo r 
awhile until Œ and I observed all this, the 
people crying, people in fear, people not 
knowing wh ere they were going to go, peopl
e just resting like we were. And finally 
Ben said okay, I think I™m up to going a little
 bit further. And we marched from there 
the next 10 blocks to get up 
to the Harmony Club. We walk
ed in and he said, come 
on up to the second floor. We went up to 
the second floor, wherev er it was and there 
were these huge leather chairs. And we ju
st plopped down  and he said okay, now 
what will you drink? And we 
had some scotch and really 
just enjoyed that evening. 
And eventually I think I fo
und my  way home by Œ I left 
Ben there, I knew he was 
taken care of and I found my  way home with
 a group of other guys in a taxi that 
night. That™s what I remember
 about Ben Livingston then. 
Q: So you™re still in this
 Œ in the same business? 
A: Yeah, the business was Œ went quite we
ll for many, many years and in 1991 we 
had some very bad lu ck , we Œ we had a Œ 
an  operation with, or 
a Œ a joint venture 
with an organization, we started a comp an
y in Puerto  Rico with a man who would Œ 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
88
we thought we could trust a
nd as often these things happ
en, we couldn™t. The Œ the 
trust was not Œ was not well placed, and we lo
st an awful lot of mo ney na Œ in  that 
particular year, so much so that we ha
d to go out of busine
ss [indecipherable]. And 
we joined  Œ we Œ wh at we wound up do
ing was set Œ discharging our employees, 
which I think was probably  one of the mo st
 difficult things I™ve ever had to do, let 
people go, tell them that we just couldn™t  carry on. And we went Œ we joined a Œ 
another organization, Stemcor at the time, w
hom we sold ourselves to for practically 
nothing because they didn™t believe we c
ould do anything. So  we said okay, we™ll 
make a deal with you. Here™s what we want 
to earn and if we don™t earn it, you don™t 
pay us anything. So  we were at risk and if
 we lost money we were prepared to make 
it up to them. And so we went 
to work  for them and it didn™
t take very long, we hit it 
just right and in  three years we had rec
overed practically everything we lost on th e 
other company. It was Œ we did exceedingl
y well. And it came time to renegotiate the 
contract and we renegotiated it and then Œ 
for two Œ fo r two mo re years. And then 
they got kind of jealous by how mu ch we
 were making, and you know, th-these 
things happen. We got into arguments ab
out why aren™t you 
paying us and th ey 
wanted to create all kinds of reserves. We
ll, you Œ you Œ we™re 
not going to pay you 
now and we™ll pay you later and we said no.
 And after two years we closed that up. 
Actually, there was a lawsuit that resulte
d from the Œ the closing of the Livingston 
organization. The banks has lost some money in that transaction as well.

Beginn ing Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with Alfred Schnog. It is
 tape number four, si
de A, and you were 
talking ab out your professional career. 
A: Yeah, so we Œ we were work ing fo r th
is organization, the name was Stemcor and 
we had, when we join ed them we did 
exceed ingly well, we had renegotiated our 
contract. And we were also involved at th
e time, together with Stemcor in a legal 
matter, which stemmed from the old business.
 And I remember th e president of that 

comp any, Ralph Op penheimer came over to 
see me and we went to see Œ talk 
settlement with the opposing 
parties, who were the banks. And the judge demanded 
that we settle for, I think a million dolla
rs was the settlement Œ would be. And I 
reme mb er taking the train back with Oppe
nheimer from the Œ from the courthouse to 
New York City. And he said, 
Alfred, you are going to  pay your share of this. And we 
had had an  agreement that we wo uld not, if
 there was such a situation we would not 
have to participate in it. And I said no, 
we™re not. We have an agreement and we™re 
going to  stick to our ag reement. We stuck 
to ours, now you stick to yours. And he 
said well, you know, if you don™t, I will not 
renew your contract. 
And I said all right, 
if that™s the way you feel. So I Œ I believe 
I said, that™ll suit me just fine. You know, I 
was sick and tired of that Œ running into 
th at kind of an  argument with him. And I 
kind of felt I mu st have a lot of my  mo th
er and father in me, because they would 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

91
have done the same thing. Th
ey  would have said no, a deal™s a deal. Let™s live by it. 
And so we left Stemco r. We then proceede
d to  have three mo re years with another 
British company where we managed for them the organization.
 And as of the 
beginning of last year, Anita
 and I have been conducting the business on our own. 
We Œ th-that business end th at they didn™t 
want Œ that they had to pull out of the 
organization because they had 
problems in Russia because of the economic problems 
that the Russians had. So the 
English really said th Œ we 
need to get out, we need to 
have somebody buy us out. And we couldn™t
 find anybody to buy 
them out so they 
decided well then we™ll Œ we™ll leave you 
and we™ll run it ourselves and maybe close 
it up, though I don™t know what they planned to do with it. But we started our own 
busin ess as of the end of Œ at
 the beginning of this year. 
And we™re Œ just the two of 
us are operating it. That™s very, very Œ it™s 
a lot of fun, and we enjoy it, it™s our life 
and Œ and we contin ue to ca
rry that on. That™s been 
successful, so Œ you know. 
Q: Do you take any busi
ness trips to Germany? 
A: I Œ no, not now. I did and Œ but it™s been
 some years now since I™ve done that. I™d 
like to take Anita to Germany, I™d like to 
introduce her to the things that I saw and 
take her to some of the places that I 
reme mb er. Wh ere my  g r
andparents lived. The 
Rhine where I went swimming, which I don™t 
think you can do toda
y. It™s like putting 
your silver spoon in to a cup of coffee a
nd watching it melt, you know. And of course

to Holland, Anita has been to
 Holland, I took her there. 
But I would like to do that, 
yes, an-and I will.  
Q: And when did you get married? 
A: Well, I™ve had Œ this is my second ma
rriage. My first marri
age, I married in Œ 
when I was quite young, 22 years old, 1953
 and had two childre
n and divorced after 
35 years of marriage, then ma
rried Anita after the divorce 
became final, about three 
years later. And we™ve been married no
w ex actly 10 years, and happily so. 
Q: And your children™s names? 
A: Well, Andrew, who is now fif 
Œ 44. And Nancy, who is now 42. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And we have Œ I have fi
ve grandchildren. Andrew has three children, two boys 
and a girl, and my  daughter has two childre
n a boy and a girl and we love them 
dearly. Anita, my wife, has 
two children as well, and on e of her ch ildren has four 
children and one of Œ and th e other child
 just had his first. So we have 10 
grandchildren altogether betw
een the two of us. So th ere™
s a lot to be thankful for. 
Q: Let™s talk now a little bit about your th oughts and feelings. 
Do Œ do you th ink you 
would be a different man toda
y than if you had had a different childhood than  you 
did and ha-had to go through th e thin
gs that you did? The difficult times. 
A: Abso lutely, I think I would be very 
different. I think that
 history and your 
upbringing, your experiences 
as a young Œ as a young man 
do form your later life.

You know, you can™t purge yourself of th
e knowledge and the feelings. They  stay 
with you all your life. And no matter how 
young you are when  y
ou experience these 
things, they remain with you. 
They remain with you. I don™t think th at I would ever 
feel entirely comfortable or at all comfor
table in any place where Jews were looked 
at as inferio r or being something less than 
what the rest o f the citizen ry of whatever 
country that is, was. I don™t 
think that I would have form
ed my feelings of social 
justice if I had not gone th
rough what I went through. 
Perhaps I would have. I guess a 
lot depends on the kind of 
education you have, on your pa
rents and how they feel. I 
am enormously offended by people who unfa
irly oppress others in Œ in any manner, 
and object to it violently wh en I Œ when  it™s 
so. I Œ so all those things come from, I 
think, my  past. I have no patience for people
 who try to bully  others in any shap e or 
form. I think that also stem
s from my  childhood. And I have
 a deep sense that history 
somehow will repeat itself some
place in the same way, and 
my God, we have seen it 
in our lifetime. We™ve seen the oppression that are visited on people everywhere in 
the world. They  may not be o
ppression of Œ of the Ch ristians
 against Jews or Œ or the 
Nazis against Œ committing genocide against 
any numb er of people. But you do have 
it, you have it Œ you had it in Œ in Bosn ia 
very recently. You ha -- it™s happening all 
over the world, it™s happening in  Indonesia 
now. It™s Œ and I have no patience for 
that. I Œ a-and Œ and I know wh at people 
come away with  who live through such  
times. How we had it in our own hemisphere
. Y-You do have to feel for the Cubans

who were displaced by Castro. Certainly so me of the things th
at happened to them 
were totally unfair to them. So all those Œ 
all those things and how I feel about them 
came about by what happened in  my  lifetime. 
Q: When  you were young, 
you Œ you had some experien
ces where you, you know, 
saw th Œ you saw parades or you saw symb ol
s that were very re
pugnant to you. Is 
there anything today that triggers that in 
you? Any sights, or any sounds that you 
sometimes hear flash back to
 your very early childhood? 
A: I think them Œ that kind of militarism, ce
rtainly it exists. It ex
isted in Russia under 
the communist regime. It probably exists in
 North Korea today, etcetera. But it Œ it 
existed in Germany in a very, very special 
way, and I don™t think it™s Œ i-it™s exactly 
the same th ing. The Germans made a specialt
y of it, and they did so historically for 
many, many, many years. I mean, you go b
ack to Bismarck and 
even back further, 
the Œ the Prussians and their Œ y-you can go 
back to Œ to Middle
 Ages and the Œ the 
Germans and th eir Œ their my thology of Œ wa
s always the Œ the hero wo rship and th e 
loyalty to  Œ to anything but Œ but a demo cratic
 society. They just didn™t have that in 
them, they were Œ th-they Œ they  were st 
Œ they were the strong, the Œ the people 
made of steel, the ones who would show th
e rest of the world exactly how Œ how it 
would operate and I don™t know wh ether it 
was Œ i-it sort of looked Wagnerian. I™m 
sure it is in many ways. German
 philosophy is replete with th
is sort of thing, of Œ of 
the super race, which is what Hitler really pl
ayed on. I don™t see th
at elsewhere in the

world, I am not seeing it elsewhere in the 
world. Sure, people th
ink we™re better than 
you are. There™s a group in the Œ in Africa, 
when one ethnic group tries to annihilate 
another, sure they think they™re better th
an they are, but they don™t try to set 
themselves up as a super race,
 as somebody that could do
minate the world, and the 
Germans always managed to do that, or th
ey have in the last 150 years anyway. Or 
maybe not so right now, but th
ey did before that. And so 
this militarism that I saw 
there and experienced there, I think is unique
, or was, at least in my  view, was unique 
to Germany. 
Q: When  your ch ildren were growing up, and 
they were five, six, seven, eight, when 

they were the age that you we
re wh en you had to leave, di
 Œ was that a difficult time 
for you? Did it bring back those times? 

A: No, no. Never thought a
bout it. Never, never thought 
about it. We™ve told our 
children what I experienced, 
but I think it was very, very far removed from their 
lives. Now Œ 
Q: Was your first wife born in America? 
A: Yes, she was. Nancy has talked at great
 length to my  mo ther, and they were very 
close. So she has had the opportunity to e
xperience first hand from her, at least, or 
let™s say secondhand, what transpired, and I 
think it has affected her. Also, her life in 
Israel, she has certainly come across 
many, many people who experienced mu ch 
more traumatic events than I did, and wh
ether they were all relayed to her, or 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
96
whether she learned anything from them, I 
don™t know, but the opportunity certainly 
was there for her to do so. My son I don™t th
ink really thinks about it. He knows that 
his grandparents came from Germany, that th
ey left on Kristallnacht and that they 
had to get out and th at many of the fami ly
 was caught up in the Ho locaust and lost 
their lives. But I™ve never ques
tioned him about it, how he 
things about it, and maybe 
I should, but maybe it™s a failure of parentin
g on my  part, that this is not such an 
important thing in his life or such an impor
tant thing in the grandchildren™s lives. I™d 
like to make it that way but I™m not sure that
 you can. I really don™t think you can. I 

think there has to be a Œ an interest and if 
that interest is spaw
ned at some stage or 

another by them, by their education or by 
what they experience, then it may be 
meaningful and then  they™ll come and ask.
 On e would hope they  would, and I™d be 
prepared, of course to discu
ss it with them in any way th
ey wished. But I™m not sure 
that that will ever happen. It™s not likely. 

Q: D-Do you feel Germ
an in any way now? 
A: Not at all. Not at all. I grew up in Am
erica. My Œ I feel as American as anybody 
who has been born here. I don™t feel Germ
an. People ask me where I™m from, I™m 
more likely to say that I grew
 up in Forest Hills, I™m not 
likely to say that I™m from 
Germany. Sometimes when I™m
 abroad and people ask me where I™m from, I ee Œ I Œ 
I might say that. I don™t know why, I gue
ss maybe it might impress the people that 

I™m talking to, so it depends who the audience
 is and what I choose to let them know, 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

or if I feel it might ma ke an impression, but it seldom ma kes an impression. I think 
they are much more likely 
and Œ to look at America the way I did when  I was a 
youngster, and they idolize it. It™s a culture
 that has, the American culture has Œ has 
gone all over the world, mu ch
, much more so than it was 
when I was in Germany. So 
we Americanized the world. 
Well, that™s a g o od thing. 
Q: Are you angry that you had to go th r
ough what you did as a very young ch ild 
because you were Jewish and that you lost
 all these relatives because they were 
Jewish and there™re other pe
ople who didn™t have to do 
that, people in America your 
age, who were born in  America. You angry about that? 

A: I don™t harbor any anger at all in that
 respect, no. I understand that people go 
through Œ have different 
experiences. There are many 
Americans who have gone 
through very traumatic experiences of thei
r own. May not be of the s-same nature, 

but certainly they Œ not every
body lives an I Œ an idealistic 
life , they have their own Œ 
they have problems, etcetera, and they Œ th
ey™re very meaning Œ meaningful in their 
lives, just like my  adventures in Germany,
 and my  leaving was very meaningful in 

mine. So, do I have an a Œ do I have ange
r? No , none Œ none wh
atsoever, none, none. 
The only anger that I harbor are those peop
le who deny that it ever happened . And 
those who by th eir ignorance want to propag
ate that sort of thinking. The Fascist 
groups that arise, the intole
rance that you so metimes see in people, that angers me. 
But I think it angers many Americans, 
not just those who left Germany.  

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog

Q: Mm-hm. Were you in any way active in 
the Civil Rights movement here in the 
60™s and 70™s? 
A: No, no, I didn™t participate in any 
active fashion there. We saw what was 
happening, of course, and I think we r
ooted for the right side, but aside from a 
rooting interest and a Œ a-and looking at so
me of the things th
at were going on and 
abhorring it, the Œ the Œ the standoff at the 
colleges and etcetera. These were Œ that it 
was happening was probably  very  good for Amer
ica, that it Œ that all this existed, that 
that kind of discrimination existed here wa
s not a surprise to me because I had known 
it existed, and here a country was going 
th rough it and was purging itself of it, 
hopefully. You see, I think the differen
ce between American society and German 
society is that in Germany under Hitler, in stitutionalized discrimi
nation and hate and 
made it a govern ment policy. I don™t th
ink that can happen here, not under our 
Constitution and under our laws. And not onl
y can™t it happen here, the country was 
founded on the basis of exac
tly not allowing that sort of thing. The Constitution was 
written with this in mind, by people who were
 very farsighted, many years ago. This 
wasn™t the case in Germany. So there™s a 
tremendous difference 
here, there and Œ no. 
I don™t Œ I really don™t think that there is a parallel to be drawn between what has 
happened here in the Civil Rights movement
 to what happened in
 Germany, there is 
no parallel. 
Q: What are your feelings about the state of Israel? 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
99
A: Well, I™m a Jew. I believe that the state 
of Israel was a Œ was heaven sent for the 
Jews all over the world. I™m fully in suppo
rt of a Jewish nationality and a state, 
totally. I don™t like what I see is h appening
. We can™t make peace with our neighbors 
in the Middle East, which is a sad, sad stat
e of affairs. I™m concerned that there will 
never be peace in the Middle East. There 
are just too many hatr
eds dating back too 
many years that these things cannot be fo
rgotten by th e people who are involved in it, 
for them. For the Palestinians, this is th
eir Holocaust. May not be of the same 
magnitude, but it™s not any easier for them. A
nd I don™t think that the state of Israel 
has done what it can to relieve that. I th
ink they can do more. Now, whether the 
Arabs will allow them, you know, these ar
e the questions that are tearing at 
everybody today. You know, we can blame e
ach other back and fo rth for a thousand 
things and find all kinds of excuses w
hy it isn™t done, but some Œ somewhere, 
somebody has to sit down with  somebody in th
 other side and th ey have to talk sense 
to each other. And will that ev
er happen? I don™t know. I su
re hope it will and I™m an 
optimist and I think eventually it may. Ma
ybe not in our lifetime, b u t hopefully it 
will, although, as I said before, I™m an optimist there, but I™m
 a pessimist as to 

whether it™ll ever happen. 
Q: What were your thoughts during th e Eichmann trial? 
A: About what?  

Q: During Œ during th
e Eichmann trial. 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001

A: I think these people epitomized the 
hateful Germans. Eichmann was a Œ a 
murderer. So were so many others, so many 
who escaped to Argentina and lived  their 
lives out in luxury in
 the Œ in the Œ the resort towns 
of Bariloche and in Montevid eo 
and places like that. I am sorry that we c
ouldn™t put them all on 
trial the way we did 
Eichmann. And do I resent those people? Yes,
 I do. I™m sorry we can™t put them all to 
death, even today. And if we find them
, we should shame them in every way we 
possibly can, no matter how old they are.
 They murdered a Œ a whole people. 
Genocide. I have no patience for that. And 
if I harbor hate, it™s against people like 
that. People like Milosevic too, who was just 
a incarnation of a Œ of Œ of these types. 
They  should be put on trial as
 quickly as we can get our 
hands on them. Now whether 
the world as a commu nity 
can do that, who knows?  
Q: Do you feel that you lost 
any part of your childhood, 
you were so young when you 
had to leave? 
A: Honestly no. My childhood
 from my Œ from my formativ
e year s was spent here in 
America and didn™t lose any of it. I was a happy ch ild. I was Œ my  family made sure 

that I was secure, despite the fact of what
 we were living through. And despite the 
fact what I observed, I never, never felt 
a personal threat. So no, I didn't miss 
anything in my
 childhood.  
Q: Before we conclude, is there any message
 you want to give to
 your grandchildren 
on th e tape? Anything 
you want to say? 

 
Interview with Alfred Schnog  
 
March 10, 2001 
 

 
 
101
A: Yes. It would be wo nderful if all, or ev
en any one of them took 
an  interest in those 
years, those very important years. I™ll sp
eak directly to them, you certainly came  
from at least one parent who lived through 
history. And it behooves you to know a 
little bit ab out your backgro
und and where you came from and why you are here at 
all, cause at any time in those early years,
 when I was younger than  you are now Œ or 
maybe not, maybe some of you are just about
 the age that I am now
 Œ that I was then, 
anything could have 
happened th at it would have made life very, very  different, it 
would have Œ you woul
d never have been born if it 
weren™t for the fact that your 
great-grandfather had the foresight to find 
his Œ and the struggle and the ability to 
find his way out of Germany. And there™s 
another thing I think th at you should 
remember. What happened then
 was the act of a governme
nt in concert with its 
people. You have an obligation to look, 
and to take part and to observe your 
government in action, to be certain that
 something like this can never happen where 

you live. You have th at oblig
ation and you mu st use what
ever effort you have, or 
whatever influence you have to 
see to it that justice for all is a part of your life and is 
a part of the national life wherever you may be living at. So do that.  

Q: Well that™s a wonderful note to end on unle
ss there™s anything else you wanted to 
say before we finish.  

A: No, I think you Œ you well 
covered everything. Yes, ther
e is one other thing I have 
to say. I said we stayed at the Whitehall 
Hotel in London, it was not the Whitehall, it

was the Cumberland Hotel on Sp
eaker™s corner and the Hyde Park corner. And that™s 
important, I don™t like to make mistakes.  
Q: Well, that™s Œ I™m g lad you am Œ re
memb ered that. Thank you very mu ch fo r 
doing th e interview and this concludes

Museum volunteer collection in
