JOHN ROSENB ERG  
August 21 & 22, 1999; May 22, 2000 
Tape 1, Side A 
 
 [Copy checked and authenticated by A.D.Š9/1/05] 
 
 

Q: Okay, this is a United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum and Kentucky Oral History 
Commission interview with John M. Rosenberg.  
We™re at his office in 
Prestonsburg, Kentucky.  
It™s August 21
st
, 1999.  And I™m Arwen Donahue and this 
is tape number one, side A.  We  
always begin just about the same  way, which is w ith your date of birth a
nd your place of birth. 
 

A: Okay.  This is John Rosenberg.  I was bor
n in Magdeburg, Germany on October seventh, 1931.  
Don™t reme mber much about that day.  (Laughter.) 
 

Q: Why not?   (Laughing.)  What
 was your name  at birth? 
 

A: Hans Meinhart Rosenberg, which was changed.  
And I retained the Meinhart, I mean in this 
country we call it Meinhart, I don™t
 refer to the mi ddle name  very often.  I think when I got off, 
when my fa mily came to this country, the immi
gration author ities told my mother that  most 
people who were named, most men who were na
me d Hans became John.  And so I became  John.  
And some how my fatherwas not 
there at the time, because he said, ﬁWhy didn™t you name hi m 
Henry?ﬂ  But I did not keep the Hans.  Some  people do keep Ha ns.  There are some  Hanses 

around, right?    
 
Q: Yeah. 
 

A: So, that™s where the John come s from.  And I ha
ve kept the Meinhart.  My
 father actually kept 
the Israel that Hitler gave 
him.  His name  was Rudolph Rose
nberg.  And you know Hitler gave 
the me n Israel and the wome n Sarah.  And the one
 thing he retained when he came to this 
country, was he called hims elf R
udolph Israel Rosenberg.  Rudolph 
I., which I don™t think he had 
a mi ddle initial from birth.   
 

Q: Meinhart, was that a family name? 

 

A: I don™t think it pre-dates me .  
I don™t think anyone else in the fa
mily has it.  And my mom asks 
me , do I have any questions when I talk to her,
 and that™s one question 
I don™t think I™ve ever 
asked, is where the Meinhart came  fr om.  I don™t 
know if it™s in the liter
ature.  I don™t know, but 
it would be a good question to ask her. 
 

Q: What was her full name , ma iden name  included? 

 

A: Her name  is Gerta Schubach Rosenberg.  Her ma iden name  is Schubach.  She was, which her 
father was a butcher in a town called Idar-Obe
rstein, which is near Bad Kreuznach, and which 
we have visited since.  And she has still some  
correspondence with an acqua intance.  Well, the

last, we went to visit a woma n a few years 
ago, when Jean and IŠJean™s my wifeŠtook Mom 
back to that community.  And there was a woma
n in the next town, which is Oberreidenbach, 
and she was sort of a ma id helper in the house. 
 Because my father, he r father had a butcher shop 
and her mother had worked, also worked in the st ore.  And I think when they had, traditiona lly 
when they had their meals, it was the three da
ughters and the parents 
and all the people who 
worked in the shop.  And they did slaughtering on
 the premises, so they needed help in the 
household.  And so she, this woma
n was still alive.  She was in 
her nineties when we were there 
about five years ago.  But– and I visited that to
wn when I was in the service.  I don™t know if 
you want to do this chronologically, sort of, or how, but– 
 

Q: I think we™ll try to do it chronologicall
y, but allowing for digr
essions, absolutely. 
 

A: Yeah, well when I was in the Air Force, I 
was in Germany at one point from 19– I was in 
England from 1953 to 1957 with an air resuppl y group.  And our mi ssion was sort of an 

intelligence mi ssion, but we dropped Special Forces 
in training mi ssions dur
ing those days where 
the Cold Wa r with Russia.  And one of our 
training mi ssionswas actua
lly in, we went to 
Germany and the, they attempted to– what they
 tried to do was set up 
a situation where they 
would drop you out of an– if you were dropped out
 of an airplane behind enemy lines, how do 
you find your way back and stay out of the way of
 the bad guys.  And the way they did that was 
to take you out in a truck and drop you off one at 
a time in fairly isol ated places.  And as they 
were doing it, I happened to look out in the little 
slit in the back of the 
truc k and I found myself 
recognizing the street that my grandfa t her™
s butcher store was on.  It was called the 
Wasenstrasse.  And so we went through this 
exercise.  Took about a week.  They identified 
certain farmers, who were friendly farmers and if
 you can make your way into
 that circuit, they 
pick you up and give you good meals and you stay out
 of the way of the bad guys.  If the bad 
guys get you, you™re in trouble.  Bu
t when that exercise was over, 
I went back to Idar-Oberstein 
and there were still people therewho reme mbered changing my diapers, for example.  And some  

of those folks who knew my grandfather and my 
mother, some of my mot her™s contemporaries 

were still there.  And then wh
en I came , that was in like ar
ound 1956.  More recently when we 
took, Jean and I took Mom back, it™s probably, oh when
 we went together it™s probably five or 
six years, maybe even eight or nine years a
go, and we happened to, we
ll we did a sight-seeing 
tour that actually started in– my, Je an™s fam
ily™s from, her mother is from Sweden, or her 
mother™s family.  We  st arted up there and then 
we  drove and eventually ma de our way to Idar-
Oberstein and spent a few days there.  And while we
 were there, it turned out that a number of 
her contemporaries were– had this
 monthly group that got together, and even though they were 
in their seventies and eighties, and they took a, 
and they™d get together once a month and they™d 
put a little money in a coffee pot and once a year 
they™d take all that money they gathered and 
take a trip on the train to some other place.  A
nd it happened that while we
 were there, that was 
the week they were getting ready to take the big 
train trip.  And so we were able to go to the 
station when all her own school 
buddies were there that morning, 
which was very nice.  And we 
me t some  ot her friends of hers, who reme mbered he
r.  And one fella gave 
us, he had a picture of 
the school they went to.  But 
the house, the butcher shop had deteriorated and was no longer 
there, but some  of the neighbors were there.  A
nyway that™s the tie-in to her community.  And 
we can talk a little bi
t more about it later. 
 

Q: Were there any Jews left  in the town?

A: I think not.  We did not– we 
really did not– our trip wasn™t ve
ry long.  We stayed in a hotel, 
and we did some  sight-seeing a
nd walking around in the area.  A
nd most of the people who were 
her age were obviously not Jewish.  Her– altho
ugh he was not a kosher butcher store that he 
had– as far as I know, we really didn™t run into 
the Jewish community, any Jews there.  When 

we were in Magdeburg, I mean this is a pretty
 small town, although now 
it™s been reconstructed 
and it has some  si milarities to– th
e Nahe River runs through the 
town of Oberstein.  And they 
did an interesting architectural thing.  They c
overed, they have  the highway over, they built a 
highway over the river, which ma de you, ma de the streets much more accessibl e.  Because the 

Nahe River separated the town of Idar from 
Oberstein and so it™s cal
led Idar-Oberstein.  
Anyway, in Pikeville, they did 
this huge cut-through 
to– because the town used to flood.  And 
they cut the big, made a cut through in the bend of
 the river and filled that in, much like this 
particular  area, but in a different way.  Anyway, 
Idar-Oberstein is a litt
le, has been rebuilt.  I 
don™t think it was terribly dama ged during the war, 
but it™s sort of touris
ty.  Looks like a little 
Swiss village downtown.  And I think if we had stayed there a little  longer, we mi ght have ma de 

more, a few more connections.  The wome n who, 
this wome n™s group, for example, told Mother 
that one of her boyfriends from school days was now in a nursing home.  In fact, it was the 

person... his name  was Hans.  And one of the funny 
stories is my mother decided to name  me 
after him.  But he apparently wa
s really failing, wa s in his nineties.
  And we didn™t take the time  
and she didn™t feel like she wanted to go to th
e nursing home.  And I th
ink, I think there are 
some , you know, all the feelings about that place ar
en™t great, because her fa mily left.  I mean 
her father and her two sisters came  to this c
ountry before, in 1936.  
They recognized a little 

earlier that they wanted to ge
t out of the country.  And I thi
nk one of the men who worked for 
my grandfather took the butcher shop over a
nd he was, hims elf very– I™ve learned, very 
sympathetic to Hitler and was very much invol
ved locally or never– I don™t know whether he 
just took over the business, didn™
t buy it.  But I know there was 
all the family felt pretty badly 
about that.  And some  members 
of my fa mily never want to go back to Germany.  Her two 

sisters have never gone back.  We  
di d a little bit of exploring.  My
 mothe r , there™s a small Jewish 
cemetery, my mother had a sister who died, a f
ourth sister, who died early, either when her 
mother gave birth to her– her mother had been 
ma rried, her father had ma rried twice.  But there 
is the grave of the young child, who either died, wa
s like a month old.  And so that ceme tery was 

still kept  in quite good condition. 
 I don™t think there was a synagogue there.  It™s comi ng back a 
little bit.  But we really did not meet any me mb
ers of the Jewish commun
ity and I doubt if there 
are any Jews in Oberstein.  Because when we 
did go, we then went to Magdeburg, my  home .  
We had not been to Magdeburg at all, because it 
was in the Ea st zone.  Ha mburg was in the We st 
zone and Magdeburg is the next large city down 
the Elbe River from Hamburg.  So when we 
went back to Magdeburg, they were having, it had 
been badly bombed in several major raids.  It 
was a town of about three hundred thousand people
, an industrial center.  We lived in the 
synagogue, we™ll get to this a lit
tle bit later, but we had– and 
the Russians had rename d all the 
streets, so they were just star
ting to rename  the m back.  And 
so we had a little trouble finding, 
trying to orient the ma p to show Mother where we
 used to live and the synagogue we used to live 
in, where it was.  Now there™s 
just a me
morial tablet in the 
location.  There was a big office 
building.  But that is gone.  But then we, it happe
ned that during the week we were there, they 
had a me mo rial exhibit to the Jewish commun
ity from Magdeburg in one of the– there™s a 
cloist er there.  There™s a very large cathedral 
in Magdeburg, which is fairly famous.  And there 
was actually, the week we were there, they werehaving a, one of these annual conferences of the

Protestant gathering in Germa
ny that moves around.  All the churches we re there and they had 
booths set up and they had services in the ma in square.  And one of the groups there wa s a group 
that was trying to promote bett
er relationships between Germa
ny and Israel.  And they, they 
were not Jewish, but that was th
e mi ssion of this group.  And they pointed us in the direction of 
some  people who knew some  of the Jewish folks. 
 Again, we went to see this exhibit and I can 

get into that with you a little b
it, because one of the exhibits 
involved, it was a diary written by 
the person who was the Rabbi in the congregation 
with my father, who had written a diary when 
they were picked up to go to the Holocaust muse
um.  I mean to go to th
e concentration camp.  
So, this is a long winded way of 
telling you that there, we know th
ere was a Jewish congregation.  
When we were walking around th
e city buildings, and we had 
this–bumped into this woma n 
who was Jewish or who knew the Jewish– had some  conne ction.  And she worked in the city 

hall, worked with the ma yor, just happened.  A
nd so, it happened when we were walking by that 
the mayor came out and we spoke to him a little bit. 
 And he said they were just  trying, starting, 
he was interested and glad to meet mother and sa
id the city was starting to put together an event 

like a lot of other cities had done
, to bring the Jewish me mbers 
of the congregation or for the 
Jews from Magdeburg, back to Magdeburg for a 
kind of gathering and re
conciliation sort of 
thing.  But I don™t think that™s happened or she continues to get mailings now from the  

congregation which is– there was not an active 
synagogue that we knew of or could find.  I 
think they said ther e were several hundred families, but we really di dn™t go out of our way.  I™ve 

got a book, little brochure at home or here, from th
at exhibit, which was ve
ry touching and very 
nice.  Had a huge wall-sized photograph of the insi
de of the synagogue where my father was the, 
where my dad was involved.  Anyway there were
 very few Jews, I think.  And it was not an 
organized congregation yet, but we
 either didn™t bump into them 
correctly.  I mean, we were, it 
was more of a sight-seeing trip than an effort to
 dig into records about 
the congregation sort of 
thing.  Because we also had a lim
ited amount of time.  And s o we 
got in the car.  I had a car and 
we did drive over to the section where Mother, 
my dad and my mo m first lived, when we came 
there.  I mean, when they first, when my father
 first married Mother in Idar-Oberstein and then 
they moved to Magdeburg.  It was a small garden
 apartment kind of place,
 a little young couple™s 
new– I™m s ure at the time looked very pretty.  
That area had not been bombed and was still 
there.  It was just much more rundown.  I mean it was like going to a building that wa s 50 years 

old.  But the flower boxes were there and we
 did ma nage to– you know, we drove by where 
they probably lived or  near where they, in that 
community.  Rema rkable for me  to see, because 
my dad didn™t have a car and he bicycled to work
 every day.  People either
 walked or took bikes 
right into, in the twenties and 
thirties.  I guess he moved to, we
ll I was born in ‚31, so he and 
Mother had been ma rried two years.  So it was 
this very pr etty little– 
it was kind of like being 
in suburbia and taking a bike, bi
king into work every day. 
 

Q: Right.  Had your father been, you said he me t your
 mother in Idar-Oberstein?   Had he been from 
there or from Magdeburg?    
 

A: My dad was a, he was born in Leer, Ost-Friesl
and, which is in the northwestern part of Ger many, 
near the Frisian Islands.  And 
I have a fa mily... I was just looking and we have a pretty good 
fa mily tree on his mother™s side of the fa mily, going back to the 1700s.  His father was a junk 

dealer and he had nine brothers
 and sisters.  He had a large family.  And t hen his father, 
unfortunately, when he was very young, commit ted suicide.

Q:  Your fat her™s fat her? 
 

A: My father™s father.  Leaving my mother
1
 with this huge, rather large family when they were... I 
think at that point he 
was probably like fifteen or
 sixteen.  And so, he went, spent some  years in 
an orphanage in Hanover and then we nt on to ou
r equivalent of college, and to be a Jewish 
school teacher, which when you think back about it, was quite an achieveme nt.  He ha d an older 

brother, Sämmy, and several sisters.  He also 
had a younger brother, who al
so commi tted suicide. 
 

Q: Your father™s younger brother? 

 

A: Yeah, name d Meir, who had an affair, I think 
with a non-Jewish girl, and decided– which was a 
no-no in a big way back then.  But he had seve
ral sisters, Jetta and 
Martha, both of whom 

ma rried of all things, butchers in 
the next communities.  And they 
came to this country.  One of 
them is na med Dan de Vries.  His wife™s name  is
 Martha.  They™ve both died in the last ten years 
and their son lives in New Jersey.  And his wi
fe is actually the woma
n who published the coffee 
book for the Holocaust museum.  His name  is Alan 
de Vries.  He™d  been ma rried before, but 

Judy and he™ve been ma rried for ma ny years.  And 
then he had this other sister, Jetta Van der 
Wyck, ma rried Nathan Van der Wyck.  They came 
to this country and had three daughters and 
she is still living.  She™s ninet
y–  She™s kind of failing, but she™s now 90, I guess.  Then he had a 
sister Ola
2
, who was ma rried and went to Argentin
a and then divorced her husband and came 
back to New York and lived there until she wasabout fifty and died.  And another si ster, Lina
3
, 
who with her husband went to Israel
, early, one of the early settlers
 in Israel.  They moved to a 
moshav
4
 in Israel.  And they have a son, Moshe, w
ho is my age and whom we have visited.  I 
think that™s all the sisters and br
others.  Two of those fa milies cam
e to this country and lived in 
New York, in the New York area.  And both of 
them were... well, Nathan was a butcher and he 
died relatively young in this country, while the gi
rls were still growing up.  The– Dan de Vries 
lived, well he  actually outlived Alan™s mother, but 
he lived to be about in
 his eighties.  And I 

think Martha was right around eighty
 when she died.  But my father, you know this large fa mily, 
his mother™s name was Wexler
5
 before she was ma rried to a Ro
senberg.  And her father and her 
father™s father were fairly prominent rabbis in
 this northern part of Germa ny.  The We xler 
family, that was there.  So, there was a very h
eavy religious influence in
 my father™s family.  
And my dad was very knowledgeable
 in Jewish law.  He knew the five books of Moses by heart.  
You could start him in the Torah.  If you go into 
the synagogue, the five books of Moses are in 
the scroll and you could star
t my father anywhere and he could give you the rest of the passage.  
So, he was a Jewish school teacher.  When he got
 his degree, he went to Idar-Oberstein I think 
originally, probably as a practi
ce teaching.  But he came there as a young bachelor.  And he me t, 
to be a school teacher.  And– or whether a Sunda
y school teacher in the Jewish school.  And he 
me t my mot her, who was a student.  She was like 
sixteen when he me t her.  I think he had 
another, I think he had a year of
 school to go.  And he came and he went.  He was, she said a 
very jealous ma n, when she was st
ill going with some  other, this 
Hans or whatever.  And she was

18, I guess, quite young, when they were ma rried.  Then he took her back to Magdeburg, where 
he got a position with the Jewish, with the s
ynagogue and the Jewish... it wasn™t the we lfare 
agency, but it was like the United, not United Jewi
sh Appeal– sort of like the Central Kentucky 
Jewish Organization.  He was assist
ing the, assisted the rabbi as a,
 not as the cantor, but as the 
lay leader, with services and with
 classes.  And then he also taught classes to people, to Jews 
who wanted to go to Israel, in Hebrew, and prepar
ing them to go.  And I th
ink he wanted to go to 
Israel, but my mother did not.  She wanted to come
 to this country, if they were going to leave, 
because her family was here.  And I think my dad 
really want ed to go to Israel, but they were, 
like ma ny others, not really, did not think this thi
ng was going to get as bad as it did.  So that™s 
where he me t her and then brought her to Magdeburg
 in this little garden apartment, this very 
pretty, young woma n.  And then a y
ear later–  Mother always lik
es to kid that I™m a– I don™t 
know if you realize that people w
ho are born in very early Oct
ober are often New Year™s Eve 
babies.  They had a big party.  Here I am.   
 

Q: Did you, you me ntioned about your 
father™s family being religious.  We re you instilled at an 
early age with a sense of reli
gion, or was there a religious– 
 

A: We were kosher at home.  We  had, I suppose 
in Germany a pretty, wh
at would be called, it 
wasn™t Reform, probably like the Conservative 
American congregation or fa mily.  We had a 
kosher household, that meant Mother had two sets of
 dishes.  We  had all, we had Sabbath.  My 
father being with the synagogue, went there regula
rly.  And I would go with him.  But I was only 
eight.  I me a n I was really young.  I went to th
e– Hitler, you know, in 1936, I believe, started, 
was when Jewish children could no longer go to school  with others.  There was a separate Jewish 

school system.  And my father wa
s actually a teacher, then became a teacher in the Jewish school 
system, in the Jewish school. 
 
Q: After1936? 
 

A: Yeah, well when I went to school first in nine
teen, let™s see I would ha
ve been six years old, 
that™s 1937 when I started.  I don™t 
know if my father had been– I 
think he™d actually, he must 
have been a teacher in that school along with be
ing at the synagogue.  I think he must have, that 

must have been his other occupation, that 
he was actually teaching 
school already, besides 
working in the synagogue.  Because when I went to
 the first gr ade, it was in the school where he 
was teaching. 
 

Q: And what did he do in the synagogue? 

 

A: In the synagogue he assisted the rabbi and wa
s a, he taught these cla
sses and he taught Sunday 
school classes, taught Hebrew school. 
 

Q: He wasn™t a cantor though? 

 

A: He was not a cantor.  There is, even in this c
ountry, a for mal training for cantors.  He could be 
the cantor and I think some ti me s he spelled the cant
or.  And a lot of times, 
Saturday nights, there 
are at the end of the Sabbath, there are services, 
which lay leaders lead or when the Rabbi or the 
cantor sit down, some body else gets
 up and takes their place for a wh
ile.  I think my fa ther could

do all those things, but his prim
ary occupation was being a teacher
 in the school system.  I™m 
just, as I™m– you know, you don™t always think about
 these things until 
you really try to, until 
you work them through.  And so, because his repa ra
tion, some of his, I think that part of my 
mother™s social security from Ger ma ny is based 
on his years as a teacher, 
not just the– not only 
the congregational status.  Though he had proba
bly several years at Oberstein and then 
Magdeburg being a teacher.  Excep
t that there was no other place,
 by that time the schools were 
segregated.  Mother was not 
working in Germany during, she 
basically was a housekeeper at 
home .  And did not have anymore 
formal training after she finish
ed high school.  Did we get off 
to some  subject on that?   You 
started to ask me something. 
 

Q: Started to ask about religi
on.  I was wondering, did you have mu
ch of a religious education? 
 

A: Well, as mu ch as you can get from six to eigh
t.  Because we, Kristallnacht  was November ‚38, 
so I was just seven years old.  I mean I probablyhad as much as any child would have in those 

early years.  So you learn a lot of
 the basic biblical stories.  Yo
u learn Hebrew to read Hebrew.  
But when we came to this country and my father
 then went south, which we can get to, I think 
we became pretty much Refor m Jews.  I mean b
ecause it was so difficult to be kosher unless... 
back then, unless you we nt to great extremes.  
Possible to do that in New York.  So– I don™t 
know if you want to talk about how we got there? 
 

Q: How you got to the South? 

 

A: Or what happened in the Holocaust
 time, itself, that™s about where– 
 

Q: Let™s... I wanted to ask a little bit more a
bout your early childhood.  Di
d you have any siblings? 
 
A: I have two siblings, one of them was  born in 
Germany, my brother, Harr
y, who is now in Chevy 
Chase, who was then– 
 
Q: Chevy Chase, Maryland. 

 

A: Maryland, right.  And he™s the head of the Mortal

apher.  Harry was– he™s four 
years younger than I am.  And my 
sister, Joan, is in Raleigh, North Carolina.  And 
she™s been an architect for twenty years and then 
went back to law school.  Right 
now she™s holding her breath to see if she passed the bar.  But 
she was an architect for the state for ma ny year
s and decided she would go back to law school, 
could be a lawyer.  So, hopefully she will know this
 week whether she passed the bar or not.  But 

my brother, you know when you™re that age in th
e early– the only real recollection that I have 

any problem about those early, thos
e years together– .I mean I have some  recollection of having 
been at Idar-Oberstein or with some rela
tives.  We went back with my father.

Tape 1, Side B 
 
Q: Okay, this is tape number one, side B.   

 

A: When we, let™s see, what was I talk
ing about?   My brother– you don™t have ma ny 
recollections– I don™t know 
how much.  Do you have 
brothers and sisters? 
 

Q: Uh huh, I have two brothers. 

 

A: Well, do you reme mber when you were five and four? 

 

Q: Not a whole lot. 

 

A: Yeah, I remember only the Kristallnacht, that he 
was out, that he was with
 my parents, that we 
were there together.  The earlier years, I canreme mber visiting relativesŠas you probably do or 

you have images of having beenŠin Leer and play
ing in my grandfather™s junkyard piles with a 

cousin, for example.  Or being in the house, just 
little things like that.  But I really have very 
little recollection of my br
other and I when we were that age.  
Or not all, or actually even not too 
ma ny– four years apart is sort of when you™re
 always one– often you™
re not in the same  
school.  But Harry was, so he was only four y
ears old.  We  had– oh yeah, when I me nt ioned 
there was another si ster.  My fath
er had another sister, name d Mary
6
.  And Mary was married 
and living in Frankfurt.  And that
™s where, when, that™s kind of, 
this is the Holocaust story.  I 
don™t know if you want to ask some  more about.  
I don™t have much else in terms of growing up 
that I recall, other than where we lived in Magdebu
rg.  We lived in the house that was adjacent to 
the synagogue, a big courtyard out front.  Had just
 enough of an incline so that my father could 
put me  on a bicycle and let me  roll down the inc
line, which he hoped he had taught me  to put on 
the brake on, so I wouldn™t smash 
into the other side when I was l
earni ng to ride  a bicycle.  The 
address was Number 2 Schulstrasse. 
 Zwei C, I think, apartme nt 2C. 
 

Q: Did you spend a lot of time  in the synagogue as a child? 

 

A: I don™t think so.  Not, I mean, a fair amount, 
not any, I mean not like an Orthodox child would.  
Although I think my father pretty much took me  to
 most services.  But it was not a daily.  I 
didn™t go every day, and Orthodox Jews do go everyda
y.  I started school in nineteen– when I 
was six.  And that™s always a very happy o
ccasion.  In Germa ny you begin school by, the big 
event is you get a large cone, about, almost as big 
as you are and there™s some  pictures.  Looks as 
big as I did.  And it™s filled with nice, with 
goodies, so you celebrate the first day of school.  
Called a 
ostertöte
. I think it actually
– I think the school year ma y have begun or you begin 
school at Easter time.  So, it coincides with East
er, if I reme mber right.  But anyway, there is, I 
do recall that.  And I recall some time being in my
 father™s classes and 
he was a very–did a lot 
of drills.  He believe d in teaching ma th with oral
 drill, ﬁHow much is three times three, four 
times four, five time s five?ﬂ aski ng ki ds around the school. 
 

Q: So you were one of his students, from the–  
Did he start teaching in 
1936 or was he teaching 
before that?

A: He was already, he was teaching.  I think that he
 had secured a job with the Jewish school system 
when he brought Mother... along with this job at 
the synagogue.  That the two were basically 
together.  Because he wa s a teacher.  
Lehrer
.  They called him Lehrer Rosenberg, teacher 
Rosenberg.  So he taught both my mother and me , 
when you think about it.  He was my mother™s 
Sunday school and religious school teacher, and I 
suppose her sisters™.  I don™t know.  We ™ve got 
some  pictures and I guess her sist
ers mi ght have been in his cla
sses also.  He was a very fine-
looking ma n in his youth.  He was a nice looking ma n 
later on.  But he did have this real store of 
knowledge.  But my sister, and as I said, her family went over.  And then my, the people, the 

fa mily me mbers who were alive, like the two 
uncles, all those people sort of left around 1936 
and were gone by Kristallnacht, as
 wa s my mother™s father, who was in New York.  I think my 
father then, in– my father, we were still 
living in, we were in 
Magdeburg the night the 
Kristallnacht happened.  And that
™s what, when I said I reme mb
ered my brother, we were 
upstairs in our apartment and my mother and his 
mother and his brother 
happened to be visiting 
with us.  Actually my mo ther said that  his moth
er had come  for a visit a
nd been there for several 
months.  She was still a fairly new– well sh
e had me , but his mother wa s a very strong, 
assertive woma n, both religiously an
d with her family, and the children really worshipped her as 
far as I– she was the epitome of a matriarch, th
at had kept this fa mily going after her husband 
had committed suicide.  She was a very strong wo
ma n.  And she lived, this is getting ahead a 
little bit, into the end, close to the end of the 
war in a concentration camp.  Because my uncle– 
which is where my uncle went.  But they were 
visiting with us.  And when the Storm Troopers 
came to the house and rousted us out that night, a
nd they brought us into the courtyard,  and 
mother I think thought, she asked 
some body whether they™re going to 
kill us, and he said they 
didn™t know.  And then they–  
 

Q: Is that some thing that you reme
mber or that your mother told you? 
 

A: I don™t reme mber.  My– she told me  that.  
She didn™t know whether we were going to live or 
not, live or die.  We  were all asleep, and th
ey just broke into the apartment and brought 
everybody in the courtyard.  And then my– the n
 they bombed, dynamited the Temp le, and they 
brought all the religious scrolls a
nd all the books out into the cour
tyard and burned them.  That™s 
what I can reme mber very vividl
y, just seeing all that stuff burn 
up.  And then eventually– they 
didn™t blow the building up.  They 
went in, the next morning when 
we we nt in, the upstairs was 
sort of caved in, the upstairs back where the wome
n would sit upstairs.  That had been detached 
from the walls.  They hadn™t totally destroyed th
e synagogue, but it was quite a me ss.  But all the 
books had been burned.  And then some where, she 
said, two or three in the morning they said, 
ﬁGo back into your house.ﬂ  And the house, things
 were pretty well upside-down, but it was, they 
just smashed a lot of stuff.  
And we went back to bed.  And 
then the next morning, early on, 
about, when it was early, they came back and the military, the Nazis came and arrested my father 

and his brother.  Now, I had always– I was ju
st reading some  stuff.  I always had this 
backwards, because I thought that my father had–
 it was interesting, because they arrested Dad 
and they took off.  And I don™t have a good recoll
ection of them arresting his brother.  Whether 
his brother and his mother left.  Because I know
 what happened was when they came  upstairs, 
they arrested, they asked for my 
fat her and they arrest ed him.  
And then my mother asked me if 
she could, asked the soldierŠhe had already gone out the doorŠwhether she– when he was 

standing there, she asked whethe
r she could give him some thing, 
ma ke a sandwich for him.  And 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
11
 
 
 
11
the guy said, ﬁYes, go ahead and do that.ﬂ  So, she ma de a sandwich and she asked me to run 
after them and give my father– and he was, th
ey were already down the 
street on the sidewalk 
with my dad in the mi ddle.  And I went runni
ng after him and gave him the sandwich.  And I 
don™t reme mber at all that his brother was anyw
here around.  My mother ma y know, whether he 
took his mother back to some wher
e else, because he was also arre
sted and they joined up in the 
concentration camp.  It™s just a 
little, some thing I™m not sure of
 right now.  But my mot her– I 
just, we were in our kitchen, I think I was on th
e ma ttress on the floor, because the beds had been 
torn up when they came back for Daddy.  
What had happened, which I thought happened 

afterwards.  My father, though, was in the concen
tration camp about eleven days.  They took him 
to Buchenwald, he and his brother.  The town 
we grew up in, Magdeburg, this very large town– 
apparently the political  establishment was not sy mp
athetic to Hitler.  Or a lot of, ther e were at  
least a fair number of people in power.  And so, w
ith thei r help, they were able to get my father 
out.  And he was ordered to get out of the country
 within thirty days.  
He was able to come  
home .  And I have a copyŠalthough 
I didn™t have it, I mean it™s at home, I recently had it out for 
some  other reasonŠof the official papers, sendi
ng him out, getting him out
 of the concentration 
camp.  My mother took me  to Frankfurt, she said, 
to my father™s sister.  The one whose name  is 
Mary, that I me ntioned a while ago, and my brothe
r.  Well, I guess no, she said she took me to 
Frankfurt and that she stayed with friends, not
 by herself.  Different people every night for 
several days during that
 interim.  Wh en my father and 
his brother were released from 
concentration camp... it must have been at the sa
me ti me, be cause I can reme mber them getting, 
comi ng to this apartment.  There was a young, my
 father™s sister ha
d a little boy, had a boy 
name d Bubi, who was my age.  And we played toge
ther.  And he was the one I played with when 
we went to see my grandfather at
 the junk shop.  We knew each other. 
 We  were just little seve n- 
and eight-year-old kids running ar
ound together.  But I reme mber 
being in Frankfurt when my 
father and his brother came  and that they were
 totally bald.  They™d 
had their heads shaved, 
which my fa ther, at that time , had a lot of hair. 
 So it was dramatic to see them, even as a very 
young child.  And we then, I think Sämmy took his 
mother probably back to Leer and we went 

to– 
 

Q: Sä mmy is your father™s brother? 

 

A: Right.  He was taller than my– was a very out
spoken fellow, very active in the Jewish youth 
move me nt.  Was in his thirties.  And he was runn
ing the junk, sort of took over the business.  He 
was the oldest son, the olde
st one of the children. 
 

Q: I have a couple questions. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: When was, I wondered about your father™s and y
our uncle™s being arrested.  We re most Jewish 
me n in Magdeburg arrested?   Yeah. 
 

A: I think they rounded up most of
– they actually, before they– my father they came  for the next 
day.  And I think they took off– the y arrested 
hundreds, ma ybe thousands
 of Jewish me n.  And 
it was not yet, I don™t think they were the only ones 
to get out.  I mean, they had help getting out 
of the concentration camp, but I think they had not 
set on this course yet of
 genocide.  I me an, I 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
12
 
 
 
12
reme mber there was this Madagascar Plan about 
sending the Jews to the  
Madagascar and getting 
rid of them and basically eliminating them, before
 they fi gured out this Fi nal Solution that they 
were going to kill everybody.  It may have been in somebody™s mi nd.  But wait a mi nute, how 
did I get on to that?   You asked me –? 
 

Q: I asked you about whether Jewish me n 
in Magdeburg in general were arrested. 
 

A: I think there were a lot of, I 
mean it was a large congr
egation.  Now the other, that wa s uh– that 
diary that I was telling you about
 when we went back to Magdeburg and they had the exhibit of 
all the Jewish artifacts?   Ther
e was an open diary by, the rabbi™s name  was Wilde, W I  L D E, 
Professor Wilde.  He was a PhD.  It was a larg
e congregation.  He had a 
very prominent role in 
the community, I think.  He starte
d this diary, saying ﬁThere we  we
re.  We  had all been arrested 
by the police, a banker and a baker 
and a rabbi and a Rosenberg.  And 
here we were sitting in the 
police station, all ex
pecting to go home  that night.ﬂ  And 
 I mean, all I coul
d read... it was in a 
glass case, so it just went that far.  He ended up 
going to England.  He also got out safe ly, but he 
was even older than my father.  I don™t know what, 
I think he just lived out 
his life in England, in 
London somewhere.  So, there were a lot of peop
le arrested after Kristallnacht.  And how ma ny 
of them– there was a family, there was actually
 a fa mily living upstairs above us in the 
synagogue, in this building, like it wa s just an 
apartment building, there ma y have be en some  
offices downstairs, but it was perpendicular to
 the Temple itself, and then there was this 
courtyard.  There was another family upstairs that
 was Jewish and they were from Poland.  And 

they came and arrested them about, several weeks ear
lier.  And I think that 
Hitler, that they were 
arresting Jews from Pol a nd and shipping them out. 
 I think that was sort of the event probably, 
although I™ll never know, you know, that got my father
 to thinking it was time to get out.  And he 
had thirty days to get out of the country and I 
always, what I™m going to tell you now is I always 
thought he did that after he got out of the concen
tration camp.  But I was reading some  notes my 
wife had ma de, which I suspect happened right afte
r they arrested the Pole
s, that he said, ﬁ Well 
how a m I going to get out of this country?   Or how can we do it at this late date?ﬂ  And he was 

told to go to the American Consulate and to get 
a visa and to go to Ha
mbur g.  Why don™t I just 
get those notes?   I was just looking
 at them, and I™ll read them.  It
 ma de a little bit of sense, in 
that it al so had and interest– these were actually 
from some  notes that Jean ma de when we were 

on a plane with my mother a few years ago.  
And let™s see– yeah, Daddy then, said Opa was 
safe– he was, let™s see, a teacher in synagogue h
ousing.  They, if I have this right, one of the 
reasons Sämmy and his mother were there is that
 they realized that it was getting to be a 
dangerous time and they mi ght have 
to try to still get out of the c
ountry.  And so mother said she 
thought that was why their stay was being extende
d, that they had starte
d realizing they were 
going to try to get to the United States.  And she sa
id he was on a– they were taking a walk with 
the family when they ran into an acquaintance, w
ho said to them that if they were going to get 
out it was necessary to go to the U.S. Consulate 
in Berlin.  And my father asked him how to do 
that and he said, ﬁYou should go to Hamburg 
in the morning and get in line and book four 
passages to this country.  Then when you get t
hose passages, you need to go to Berlin to the 
Consulate to let them know you™ve
 got your tickets.ﬂ  So my fath
er, she said, cas
hed in his life 
insurance policy and bought 
the tickets and got the papers togeth
er to get a visa to come to the 
United States.  He sent the visa application, he sa
id, by registered ma il to Berlin.  Then he went 
to Berlin and stayed there with his sister
 Ola and her husband, who was– reme mber her 
husband was not Jewish, which was another very– they™re the ones who went to Argentina.  So, 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
13
 
 
 
13
he went there.  So he went there, he went on to
 the office, but they did not find his papers.  He 
showed them the registered ma il stub, which was c
opied and he was told that he would then get 
the confirma tion of the fact that he would be a
pproved to go to this country.  He got a letter, 
eventually he  got a letter with the number on a 
piece of paper, which he kept on his person.  And 
it said, he gave that piece of paper to Sä mmy, hi
s brother, when the Gestapo picked him up after 
Kristallnacht and took him to the 
concentration camp.  Sä mmy in tu
rn gave it to his mother, who 
took me  and went to Mary in Frankfurt.  So hi
s mother then– what isn™t clear to me , is what 
happened to Sä mmy.  I s uppose they must have arre
sted him after my father
, but I just didn™t pay 
any attention to him because I just wa sn™t focused.  Because they took him off.  Because she 
said, it was actually his mother, who took me  
off to– Mom s a id, you know, that she took Harry, 

who was only four at the time and waited around 
and went from house, lived with different 
fr iends in the community while they were wait
ing for my father.  But he had this little 
registration number, which as you 
know, probably from other stories, people were selling their 
souls and live s for, because they were, it was th
e quota system that determined whether you were 
going to ma ke it to this country or not.  And we 
were, we then went, during this thirty-day period 
they got all their belongings toge
ther and filled it in one of thes
e things they call–what™s the 
name  of this thing?   Wh ere you put everything 
in a big box that™s going to go to the other 
country.  And they packed up all their furniture 
and it was sent to Rotte
rdam.  And they ma de 
their way to Rotterdam, Holland, where we were in
 this sort of an internme nt camp.  It was 
actually– I think we went on the train and it wa
s a large, overnight hostelry for people who 
would otherwise have taken, say, the Holland Ameri
ca Line ship.  The boat to this country on a 
norma l, as a tourist trip.   
 

Q: Before we leave Germany I want to, I had a
nother question.  First a
bout Kristallnacht.  You 
described being taken out of your house in the 
middle of the night by th
e Storm Troopers and 
then watching them burn all the Torah scrolls.
  Was that the first– what do you remember, 
personally, about that?   Was that the first time  th
at you had realized the danger of the situation? 
 

A: I want to believe that I reme mb
er the signs on the, some  of the signs that said No Jews Allowed, 
which you know popped up on stores.  And we– the family... but I don™t reme mber, as a six or 

seven year old having any, you know you just learn wh
at the rules are.  Don™t go into this store 

or you stay with your parents or you go to school
.  I don™t reme mber chil
dren other than my 
cousin.  So I don™t know that I ever wa s afraid. 
 And I don™t think my parents ever gave me  any 
reason to be afraid.  I mean we lived a very nor
ma l life.  And I didn™t know, I do reme mber that 
we, I played with the kids of that Polish fa m
ily.  They had two children.  I think their name  
mi ght have been Finkelsteiner.  They had two ch
ildren and I reme mber them.  But I don™t– and 
so they were gone.  I don™t reme mber , you know, th
at we were living in fear, or–  until these 
Storm Troopers showed up at the house that I ha
d any conscious feeling about even knowing that 
things were bad.  As I say, in our town th
ere was not a lot of sympathy for him.   
 

Q: So, do you reme mber that mo me nt of watching th
e Torah scrolls be burned and being pulled out 
of your house in the mi ddle of the night? 
 

A: I do reme mb er the fire.  I mean I do reme mb
er going, I do reme mber, probably because it was so 
vivid.  And when I told this story before or talked 
about it, that it stays a little bit in front of your 
mi nd, so it™s probably hard to separate.  But I have 
this very strong recollec
tion about this fire in 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007

14
the courtyard.  And my father be
ing arrested and running after hi
m.  And I just– so those are 
the, I guess, the vignettes that I reme mber.  I 
remember them comi ng to the apartment and my 
mother giving me  the sandwich.  And I reme mbe r
 that one of them, this fellow who was in 
uniform, who said that she could go ahead and ma
ke a sandwich, seemed to be very friendly, or 
was a very, he said okay and he wasn™t– they di
dn™t beat any of us, I mean, we– I™m sure the 
adults were very fearful, because they were forc
ed out there.  I was just
 a little kid and everybody 
said, ﬁGo outside in the yard.ﬂ  
I mean as I said, my mother certa
inly was very afraid and they 
didn™t know what they were going to do.  And they did it all over Germany.  She told me  that, 
Mom said at one point that they had heard th
at wa s going to happen th
at night, some thing like 
that, that people, that this was– if I, you mi ghtknow this.  I think that they had an excuse for 

doing it, some  official, some  Ger man
 official had been killed and this wa s an act of retribution.  
It was the wa y they got at it.  And so, I don™t know
 that word had spread 
that this was the night 
that they said we™re going to synagogues and 
arrest– blow them up and a rrest everybody.  But 
they just, they knew some thing was going to happe
n.  But they went to bed.  They didn™t know 
what.  I don™t know whether anybody was awake, because we were rousted out.   
 

Q: So do you reme mber being particularly afraid?   No. 

 

A: No.  I really don™t have any, a
ny recollection.  And all I reme mber 
is that I do reme mb er a little 
bit of going to Frankfurt, only because  some how 
at one point , I reme mber we were eight years 

old, and my cousin and I were under the table, pl
aying under the table and seeing the knees of all 
these adults sitting around.  I mean, it™s just sort
 of a goofy thing, but they were also killed.  I 
mean al most everybody, this family and this cousin were gassed.  Sä mmy a nd his mother, we 

stayed– well you wanted to go ahead about Germ
any.  Whe n we get into Holland, I™ll tell you 
what I reme mber about Sä mmy and his mother.  Bu
t that™s really about al
l I remembe r  of those 
days in Germany.  It™s not a– I remember
 going some ti me , vaguely, going back to Idar-
Oberstein as a kid, but not 
much.  I was just too young. 
 

Q: Okay, one more question about Germany, then– you had me ntioned, did you me ntion that your 
father was involved in some  way wi th helping 
Jews, who wa nted to emigrate to Palestine? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Can you say some thing about that?   And also did 
he have any interest, did your parents have any 
interest in trying to emigrate to Palestine at  that  time? 
 

A: Well I said my dad, I think, wanted to go and my  
mother did not.  She wanted to go to America.  
If they were going to leave, she wanted to go to
 this country, where her family lived.  But his 
sister had gone to Israel and 
I think he– Lina and her husban
d, whose name  was Ivan Van der 
Wyck, another Van der Wyck– de Vries.  I™m s orry
 de Vries.  And I just actually had sent a 
little note to my cousin, when 
we were– I visited them when I was in the Air Force fi rst, in 
1956, when I was still single and was stationed in Engl
and and went to Israel. 
 I stayed with them 
and toured the country.  And then when Jean was 
pregnant with our Michael, we went over.  And 
so, we™ve had some  connection over the years.  A
nd they have a son, Moshe, and his wife, Nurit, 
have a son, who ca me  to this country and was 
ma rried a few years ago.  And my dad and mo m 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007

did go to Israel afterwards.  
In fact Sä mmy™s widow– Sä mmy got ma rried in the concentration 
camp, which we will– ca n get to or  just say, and his wife – 
 
Q: Yeah, you can go ahead and say what camp he was in. 

 

A: Well, he went, I think he and his mother– I m
ean, we got out.  We  went to Holland and they did 
not.  Whether he went back to Leer, I™ll have
 to ask my mom whethe
r– where they went.  
Whether they went to Holland or  back to Leer
.  Because they went to– I think they did 
eventually get to Holland and he was supposed to 
leave on the next boat.  
I don™t think he was in 
the camp with us.  I™ll have to– I mi ght just s

father had a sister in Frankfurt, was name d Elly

.  The sister in Rotterdam was name d Mary.  She 
was ma rried to a stock broker name d Herman Me sc

had some thing like five children.  And we 
would be able to visit with them–

Tape 2, Side A 
 
Q: –sorry, let me  just quickly say, this is ta
pe number two, side A of an interview with John 
Rosenberg. 
 
A: I think that it was simply a trai n trip fr om 
Ger many to Holland.  And they had arranged, it was a 
legal, they had the papers.  They had to be out 
by thirty days and they had packed everything up, 
except a few little, except their day- to-day living 
clothes and put everythi
ng in this big lift is 
what they called them, I think.  And they expected 
eventually to send that 
to this country.  As it 
was, it went to Holland and sat there while 
they were in the internme nt camp.  And– 
 

Q: Did you all enter 
Holland illegally? 

 

A: No, I think it was just, my recollection is it was ju
st a train trip and that 
he had his passport or the 
proper papers to go to Holland.  And had been direct
ed to be out of the country in thirty days 
from the time he was out of th
e concentration camp.  That™s w
hy I had originally thought he 
went– that™s when he– I had always reme mbered th
at he went to Berlin or that he stood in line 
in Hamburg and in Berlin.  This little thing I 
had read from my wife™s notes, that mot her had 
recalled the other part of it, th
at he, I think he ended up standi
ng in line for at least a day in 
Berlin at the Consulate to get this number, wh
ich was so precious, which ended up being the key 
to allowing us to get out of Holland and comi ng to 
this country.  But the tr
ain, I don™t think there 
was anything particularly notewor
thy about the trip to Holland.  
They went to Holland.  Mother, 
I think, did a lot of the arranging of that while 
my father was in the concentration camp.  Or 
friends of hers helped her do that, with– and wh
en he got out... I me an, they knew they were 
going to have to leave.  And they 
were able to keep this number. 
 
Q: Did they know that they would 
be staying in this transit camp? 
 
A: Yeah, I think so.  I mea n they must have– I 
think that the immigration 
authorities, the Jewish 
welfare agencies– I mean they had their– for one
 thing, he had his tickets.  He had purchased 
the tickets to come to this country, so it was th
e logical pl ace to go.  It was also a pl ace full of 
immi grants.  I don™t know if they 
put people there who did not have 
their papers in order or had 
booked their passage.  People had their passages
, but they coul dn™t leave until they had an 
approval from the authorities in the United St
ates.  You had to–you know, they had a quota.  
So, that was the other part of the– the probl
em was getting a sponsor in this country.   
 

Q: So everyone in the camp  was waiting to come  to the United States? 

 

A: Yeah, as far as I know.  I mean, whether they 
were waiting... they were also taking boats to othe r 
parts of the world, I™m not sure.  But that™s wh
at they were wa iting to do, was to leave on the 
boat.  And I™m not, don™t conscious, have no real 
recollection of people going ahead of us.  We  
ended up being there for a year.  And, large 
building like a hotel, 
and on each floor the 
furnishings and the layout sort of was equivalent
 to the class of the boat that you would be going 
on.  So if you were a first-class passenger you™
d ha ve a little– each of these floors, as I 
reme mber them, had a series of comp artments where people would stay, normally for a day or 

two before leaving on the boat.  So, the firs
t-class cabins would have a little fancier

17
compart ment.  I mean these compartments weren™t ve
ry big.  They were like twelve by twelve, at 
least, small.  And then we had, the one that my fa mily had wa s a very austere, it was, I don™t 
know if it was equivalent to Daddy™s class, but it 
was sort of, it was just a very small enclosure 
with two double beds, with bunk beds.  And my 
brother and I were on an upper and lower and 
my mo m and dad were across from us on an upper a
nd lower and there wasn™t anything else, that 
I can reme mber, other than ma ybe a little thing, ca
binet to put your clot hes in.  And then people 
congregated in other parts of that facility.  Th
ey had a library, reading 
room.  They had a large 
cafeteria or a large dining room
.  Huge dining room, where everyone
 ate at the same , together.  I 
always tell people I reme mber the sign on the wa
ll said, in five langua
ges, ﬁDon™t spit on the 
floor.ﬂ  That was the sign.  They had this huge sign.  Don™t spit on the floor.  My father, so it was 

pretty, you know, it wasn™t a great 
living conditions.  But my fathe
r™s sister and her husband and 
their children lived in Rotterdam.  They were Du
tch residents.  I don™t know where she me t hi m.  

His name was Herman.  I think I me ntioned that.  
And he was a stock broker and they were fairly 
well-to-do and we could go to see them or they 
could come to see us.  I mean we weren™t, it 
wasn™t any concentration camp.  It was just, I th
ink that it was an internment camp and you could 
go away, go out on weekends.  But no one had any 
vehicles, and unless you had a lot of money, 
which they had hardly any money, 
you basically stayed where you were. 
 

Q: Did they have to, did your fa mily have to pay 
to stay there and have th
eir meals?   Or how did 
that work? 
 

A: I think it was all, I mean th
ey had a little, they didn™t– now
 my father... I don™t recall that 
anybody had to work.  I can ask Mom.  I don™t think so.  I mean I think it was run by the Jewish 

Welfare Agency. 
 

Q: The whole camp? 
 
A: Yeah, I me a n I think there wa
s a relationship there.  Maybe it
 was a relationship to the Holland-
America Line.  It mi ght have been that it was, 
some one or the immi gration authorities people.  I 
don™t recall, but I can ask.  I don™
t think that Mother worked in 
the kitchen, for example.  It 
would be nice to know.  We ™ve neve
r talked very much about that.  But my father decided to 
organize a school for the childre
n in the camp and he did that. 
 

Q: Completely on his own? 

 

A: On his own, yeah.  He said, I 
want to do that for the kids.  A
nd so he started a school and gave 
instruction for a year, while we were there.  We
 had to, he or the people, his sisters who were 
here and some  others set about trying to find a 
sponsor in this country.  And they ultima tely 
found some one who was a fairly we
ll-to-do person, ‚cause none of 
his family had any money to 
speak of and they couldn™t vouch for– they were 
not citizens, so they couldn™t vouch for him.  
So during that year they found a sponsor for hi
m, a fellow who was either an architect or a 
builder in Ne w York, who my father went to see 
after we got here and said thank you,  and that 
was the last contact, except that
 in later years, my brother ha
s me t the son of that person, who 
lives in Wa s hington, also. 
 

Q: Do you know his name ?   The name  of the father and the son? 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
18
 
 
 
18
 
A: I think his name  is Meyer, Andr
ew Meyer.  Does that ring a bell? 

 

Q: No, I started to chuckle, because
 I said the name  of the father and the son, and just almost said 
the Holy Ghost.  (Laughter.)   
 

A: Oh, oh.  No, but it turns out– his name is Meyer 
and it turns out that, that
–that his father, that 
this Meyer, who was our sponsor, that his family 
and our fami ly come  together in the seventeen 
hundreds with a family connection name d Budenweiser, which led me  to think they actually 

identified some one who was very 
distantly related.  There are some  Meye rs in our family.  And 
my brother ultimately figured out and I think that  
David, this fellow, Meyer, the son, that there 
was a fa mily connection, a couple of hundred year
s back.  So there is 
a relationship.  Pr obably 
some body s a id, why don™t you go see so-and-so, we don™t have very much to do with him, but 

ma ybe he™d sponsor your father.  That some one cont
acted him, Hans Meyer.  They knew that he 
was there.  He was well-off, but very distant fa
mily.  And he agreed to sponsor my family.   
 

Q: Was this part of the hold-up, that you
 didn™t have a sponsor in the U.S. ? 
 

A: I don™t know why we were there a 
year.  I think part of
 it, no we were not– I think part of it was 
that we were not very high up on the list.  That th
ere were others in front of us by a long way.  In 
fact my father was, we went in that camp 
probably in– Kristallnacht was Novembe r  and Dad 
was there until the end of November, and then 
December.  We  probably we nt to Holland in 
December-January.  And we came over on the boat in Febr ua ry 1940.  That was just before the 

war broke out with Holland.  In fact, we were either
 on the last boat or the ne
xt to last boat.  And 
my dad had already been told that
 he was going to be the school te
acher either in Theresienstadt 
or in the camp that Anne Frank was sent
 to, the fi rst, the concentration camp. 
 

Q: Westerbork? 

 

A: Westerbork, right.  He wa s going to be the teacher
.  They wanted him to start that school.  And 
he said, I™m– want to go to America.  And he th
en, there was a fellow... that™s in these notes as 
well, ‚cause I keep forgetting the name.  He said 
that as time was growing short, he went to the 
Jewish Immigration Agency to find out whether, 
the hold-up.  Because he was not near the top.  
And when he got there, he me t a fellow na me d Doctor Moses, who was one of the interview, 

committee interviewing people.  And he and Doctor
 Moses– in Germa ny, he had helped Doctor 
Moses solicit money for Israel.  And Moses reco
gnized my fat her.  And my dad– and then he 
arranged for us to be on one of the next boa
ts.  So, it was a little ﬁgood old boyﬂ.  And, but I 
mean we had been there a year.  I think there were
 a lot of those stories that also– that  it was a 
numbering system from t he top to the bottom, but
 that if you paid some one, or you alwa ys heard 
of, there were probably people moving up that had some  influence with whoever.  And so, my 

father said, ma naged to get this connection or 
lucked into this connection.  Whether he was 
moved up or he would have been on that boat, I 
don™t know.  But because they were apparently, 
what they were doing wa s interviewing family
– they had a committee on which this Doctor 
Moses sat, and he– they determined who was 
going to go.  Because there were probably all 
sorts of priorities.  Are they
 elderly?  Do they have– how do you– we™ve got a whole building 
of people who need to go to the United Stat
es and the boats only hold so ma ny and some body

can go and some body can™t.  This is my
 number.  And we have a lot of little children.  So I think 
he was able to, that™s what happe
ned.  Whether he pulled some stri
ngs or whether he just was in 
the norma l course of things and said, you can go.  Bu
t whatever it was, that™s how we got here.  
So his number, he still ha d that 
little piece of pape r and they™d 
found a sponsor.  And so we were 
on that last boat, I suspect.   
 
Q: So it was very, very fortunate.  If you hadn™t 
gotten onto that boat, you 
wouldn™t have gotten out. 
 

A: We ll, that™s for sure.  Yeah, that™s for sure, 
we would not have gotten– no there wouldn™t have 
been any other way.  And I don™t think there was 
any chance of going anywhere else.  My uncle 
and his mother, again, I™m not sure why I don™t reme
mber that they are there.  But apparently 
they were on another boat.  They came , they we re
 in fact on a boat that 
was then turned– I think 
that you go through England.  I have some
 recollection as a young boy, you know, you™re 
playing on the boat.  People, everybody™s always 
looking for mi nes.  There were all sorts of 
mi nes floating out in the English Channel, becaus
e the war wa s about to start.  And there was a 
route that you could ma ke and we went.  And 
I reme mber looking for the mi nes or looking and 
people say, there™s some thing out there.  I believe 
they were in fact on a 
boat and that the boat 
was turned around and they got off.  Now, whethe
r they were in this same  camp or some where 
else, I™m not sure.  I don™t know why I would not
 have reme mbered them being there, but I™ll 
have to ask.  I™m just not sure.  
 

Q: And they both did not survive the war? 

 

A: No, what happened was they went from there to
 Theresienstadt.  You have the right word for 
Holland, it was We sterbork.  I always  forget that.  Theresienstadt.  And they were there.  My 

uncle Sämmy apparently was in charge of th
e leather-working shop.  They ma de boots and 
repaired leather stuff.  And they were there in
to, they were there in 
1944.  And apparently my 
uncle became a little outspoken.  The war was tu
rning and they knew that.  And he made some  
untoward rema rks about the Nazis,
 about these shoes are too good 
for them or some thing.  And 
some one told on him and he was sent to Auschw
itz.  And he was in the line to go, to be 

exterminated and he ran to the electrified fence a
nd they shot him.  We heard that from, I think, 
his wife.  During those four years,
 three years that he and his moth
er were in Theresienstadt, he 
me t his wife  and they were ma rried.  And when 
I was with mo m last weekend, we have pictures 
of their wedding, of them getting married on the 
day they got married.  I mean of their wedding 
or they™re being ma rried.  She wasn™t wearing– she 
was an adult.  They we
re in their thirties.  
He was probably born in 1900, so 
he was forty years old.  They were both forty.  She was a 
lovely person.  And they were ma rried.  You know 
they all had coat– he had a coat and a tie on.  

And some  of their friends are around them in a 
picture.  This was the end of ‚44.  And his, 
Daddy™s mo ther died, I think, must 
have died right after he wa s 
moved to Auschwitz.  I looked it 

up, I mean it™s like a couple, a few months apart. 
 She was, hadn™t been doing well, but she was 
born in the eighteen–  I mean she 
was probably in her seventies, 
I think.  I™ve got that in the 
other room.  We  looked up the book, the Gedenk
8
 book where she™s listed.  But she had survived 
into the late forties and he, wit
h, being with her son.  And so, she was there when he got ma rried, 
which was nice.  And– but then when they move d him to Auschwitz, she died.  And then we–

his widow lived, and went to Israel.  And Jean and 
I visited her in Israel.  And that™s where this 
sort of, I me an that™s what she was told happene
d to Sämmy.  She knew that he had been taken.   
 
Q: I had a couple of questions about your time 
in the camp, at least one question.  So when you 
were staying in the camp  in Rotterdam, you were 
presumably one of your father™s students.  Do 
you reme mb er what the school–? 
 

A: Well, it was just he brought thes
e kids together of varying ages 
around a big table.  It was just a 
little sectioned-away room, for I don™t know how
 ma ny hours.  And you™d do your ma th tables, 
and he™d tell you some  st ories.  He wa s just 
teaching.  My father had a habit when he, in 
Germany I always reme mber that when he was t
eaching Bible stories, he would always tell you 
three-fourths of the story and leave the ending fo
r the next week, so that you were anxious to 
find out what was comi ng.  I don™t really reme mb
er very much about school, except where it 
was, and I reme mber there was, I was, one of 
the people who was there had a violin that he 
played and gave violin lessons.  And I think my
 parents thought that would be a good idea.  So 
he loaned me the violin for a lesson, but I reme
mber that I was not very good.  And he got his 
violin back.  I think he thought it was going to– 
mi ght be untuned or leaving it with an eight-
year-old was not the right thing 
to do.  And I don™t really reme mb
er very much about the camp.  
I reme mber a little bit about th
e library and where the books were
.  And the older people would 
sit down.  They had a radio. 
 

Q: How ma ny s t udents were in the school together? 

 

A: There were probably fort
y or fifty with us.  And whether he 
did it in shifts or not, I™m not sure. 
 

Q: Did you all have to share bathr
ooms with a bunch of other people? 
 

A: Well there were no, yeah, I mean you had 
communal bathrooms on each floor, because there 
were no– I don™t know if the first-cl
ass facilities had private baths.
  This room where we were 
they had a little sink, I think, w
ith running water, but they didn™t– the bathroom as such was 

down the hall.  It was pretty spartan.  I mean 
it wasn™t terrible because it wasn™t– you weren™t 

under a guard.  But it was, it was ve
ry plain.  And then when they found, when they got ready to 
leave, they learned that they could not– there wa
s a limit on what they could take out.  It was 
like twenty-five or fifty dollars.  And so all the 
stuff that they were going to take– my mother 

really doesn™t reme mber  what happened to it.  It 
stayed.  She was able to
 bring over some  linens, 
some  crystal, which she still has, and some  me me
ntos, several boxes of stuff, things that they 
could pack up.  But no furniture, which they ha
d brought from Germany an
d things like that.  
They just either sold them for a very, for a song– 
 

Q: Did your dad teach all the lessons in German?  

 

A: I think he did, yeah.  German and perhaps some  Hebrew.  Of course, I don™t know why anybody 
would have just spoken–But it would have bee
n– I don™t know that he knew any Dutch.  When 
he came to this country really 
the only other language that he 
knew was German.  He knew some  
broken English that he had lear
ned.  Mother didn™t know any E
nglish.  I reme mber when we 
were on the boat, I reme mber, I told people I saw the 
Wizard of Oz
 was playing.  Wa s the first

21
American color movie, you know, technicolo
r movie, sound, Judy Garland.  I couldn™t 
understand the English, but I saw the– they showed the 
Wizard of Oz
 on the boat.  I™m sure it 
was a nice boat trip.  I mean for us, that was ki
nd of fun, just a little 
kid running all over the 
place.   
 
Q: What happened to your uncle 
and family in Rotterdam?    
 

A: They were– they didn™t get out.  They were
 also killed.  I don™t know if they went to 
Westerbork.  I tried to, Mother 
and I looked for his name in th
at book.  We were in, when we 
were in Magdeburg– after we went to Magdeburg 
on that trip I was telling you about, we went 
to Berlin for sightseeing and to look around, and 
we found a Jewish library there in connection 
with the synagogue or with the agency and they
 had one of these Gedenk Books where all the 
Holocaust victims were listed alphabetically.  So, 
that™s where I saw my uncle and my mother.  I 

looked for some of– 
 

Q: Your uncle and your grandmother? 

 

A: My grandmother.  And I don™t reme mber that I–
 I think we looked for some of the others and 
couldn™t find them.  Her mann– the y were, all of that family was killed, the one in Rotterdam.  

The fa mily in Frankfurt was killed.  The sister
 that was living actually
 in Berlin, went to 
Argentina and then up here.  And as I say, moth
er™s, I mean my father™s mother, because my 
mother™s family had come , already come  to this country.  When we came to the United States, 

they were there to greet us.  
Her two sisters, one of whom I 
think– well neither of them were 
ma rried at that point.  But they were all livi
ng on, with my grand, with mot her™s parents.  
Mother™s parents had come  over and my grandf
ather who owned a butcher shop was working as 
a butcher in a large rest aurant 
in New York.  And he had gotte
n a job and was ma intaining the 
fa mily. 
 

Q: Was he a kosher butcher? 

 

A: No, he, no.  And it was not a– it was called, 
I think the restaurant was called Zimmer ma n™s 
Hungaria.  I think it was a Hungari
an restaurant.  I think he coul
d be, I mean he knew what there 
was to know, but he wasn™t a kosher butcher in 
Germany.  Then he went, they went to the 
synagogue, this was 803 West 180
th
 Street, right across from th
e George Washington Bridge.  
Big neighborhood of German i mmi grants in those da
ys.  It™s changed a lot.  A lot of Spanish-
speaking people living there now, along with a fe
w of the– some  have actually– well, I was 
with Mother– one of her friends, who lived downsta
irs, is still in that same  building, called her 
to wish her a happy birthday.  At 803 180
th
 Street.  Her sisters came  to the boat and we  moved in 
with them initially.  Just squeezi
ng into an apartment.  It was a fairly good-sized apartment.  But 
we lived with them.  And at that time, there 
was not a very good, for 
some reason, there was no 
one that really told my dad what he ought to 
do is get his teaching degr
ee for this country and 
learn to speak English and to go on with what he 
was doing.  Or if they told him, he didn™t think 

he could quickly take care of his fa mily.  And th
ere was very little work in New York.  Most of 
the jobs were cleaning for wome n or people were
 doing stuff at home.  There was an enormous, 
what do you call it, craft kind of 
stuff, they give you– my mo th
er and her sisters would sit 
around sewing slippers together, the bottoms and t
ops of bedroom slippers, piecework, to ma ke

money.  Mom was actually a ma id.  She™d go out
 and was cleaning apartments, cleaning houses, 
doing a little bit of nannies.  My 
father after a very short time , h
eard that there were jobs in the 
South and he went to Spartanburg, South Carolina
 and star ted sweeping fl oors in a textile mill, 
so he could take care of his family.  So he we
nt to Spartanburg and got a job, through– I me an 
he got a job, he knew where he was going.  
Some body had said, contact this ma n when you get 
there.  So, it was a very me nial job initially 
and then he– he swept floors and he did ma nual 

stuff and pretty quickly learned how to– he beca
me  a shift manager at one point and he brought 
us, he had saved his money and got a small apartm
ent, and about six months later we moved to 
Spartanburg, South Carolina.   
 

Q: Before we go on, do you reme mber anything 
else about your journe
y to the U.S.?    
 

A: I don™t, I me an the boat, just 
that it wa s a boat trip and we were
– it was a big ship.  And a little 
kid could run all over the boa
t.  And I reme mber the 
Wizard of Oz
. 
 

Q: What about arriving?   Did 
you arrive at New York harbor? 
 

A: We ca me  through New York.  We  did not, for 
some reason, go to Ellis Island. I™m not sure, 
because I think– because our family came to me et us and we went on.  Recently I aske d my 

mom if we went to Ellis Island, 
‚cause I didn™t reme mber that, 
us doing that.  And I think my 
father was– we all went off and the name  ch
ange must have actually taken place while he 
wasn™t around.  Because he mi ght have– even 
when the paper stuff was done, he had already 
gone to Spartanburg.  It said Hans is no longer Ha
ns.  Your son™s name  is John.  But the flags 
were out when we came.  We  landed on February 22
nd
 when we passed the Statue of Liberty.  
And so we thought this is really nice, they™ve go
t all the flags out for us, but it was Washington™s 
birthday.  So I mean, and I reme mbe r  my aunt 
giving me  a quarter and telling me  that was a lot 
of money and I should hang on to
 it, very, very carefully. 
 
Q: Do you remember how you felt at the time? 

 

A: No.  I mean I think you™re ki
nd of, you™re in wonderme nt.  I m
ean all of sudden you take a boat 
trip and there™s the St atue of Li
berty and then you come  up with your
 family.  You™re glad to see 
your fa mily, because you™ve known them.  It™s been a few years since– they had been over 

since ‚36, I think, ‚37.  So they were, let™s see, 
Mother was born in 1908 a
nd she™s the oldest.  So 
Irma and Ruth
9
 were just eighty, so they 
were, I think they were bor
n, that would ma ke it about 
1920.  So they were in their early twenties when
 we me t them.  I think Ruth became, went 
through dental hygiene school and I don™t know that
 Irma was just working in various places.  
They both met their husbands in the next few 
years.  One of, Irma™s husband was Jewish and 
then they both went into the 
service, I think.  John and Wa lte
r.  Wa lter was a baker and the– 
John was a salesman.  And I went– they enrolle
d me  in a school called P.S. 132 and they put 
me in a class with kids fr om other countries.

A: –the children from other countries and I don™
t know how one teacher handled them.  I think 
they taught you some  ba sic English.   
 
Q:  You didn™t speak any English. 

 

A: I spoke no English.  You pick it up pretty quic
kly on the street playing with other kids.  And I 
stayed in that room.  It™s funny, because now, 
you know, they have the dr ess code that™s going 
on.  At least one day, on Thursdays you had to w
ear red, white and blue.  It was red, white and 
blue day.  And that was all new to me .  But they 
had some  codes.  But I think I did pretty well 

and adjusted with these other kids.  I walked 
to the school, it was proba
bly three-quarters of a 
mile, every day, from where we lived to the school.  And after, I rememb er after maybe a couple 

of months, I was sort of mainstreame d into an
other, into the regular– 
what would that have 
been, probably the third grade, second or third gr
ade and I was there.  And then we moved to 
Spartanburg.  My father had rented a small 
walk-up, in a poor– it was not a very well-to-do 
neighborhood.  But a little apartmen
t that he could afford.  Ac tually he had saved enough money, 
he said, to have bought a car, but 
they decided to buy furniture or some thing.  But he worked in 
the shirt factory doing fairly me nial work initia
lly, as I said.  Then unf
ortunately after a few 
months, he had an– he fell off a ladder, which wa
s interesting, because in this apartment where 
we lived, we had just a couple of rooms, two or
 t hree rooms.  My mother did the laundry on a 
potbellied stove.  So, she had relied on him to al
ways pick up this big vat of clothes and laundry 
and put it on.  We  had this little wood burning 
stove and burned corn cobs and I suppose coal.  
And she™d boil the clothes and wash them the ol
d-fashioned way.  And when he broke his foot, 
he couldn™t do that.  As a result 
of that, he went downtown and we had the first Bendix automa tic 
washer.  This little immi grant fa mily in Sparta
nburg, South Carolina had one of the very first 
automa tic washing machines in 1941.  Neighbors woul
d come in to look at 
it and see the clothes 
spinning round and round and round.  And 
Daddy bought it on time, you know, you could buy– 
I mean he was ma king not a lot of money.  But we
 used that washing ma chine for ma ny years.  
Until even when we went to Gastonia, it just  kept
 on working.  It was called, I re me mber it was a 
Bendix.  But my father also then, it was very inte
resting in our little apartment, ‚cause he– there 
was no rabbi in Spartanburg and so he– I don™t 
know if they ever had one before the war, 
whether they just got– I mean the Jewish co
mmunity learned right away about his vast 

knowledge of Jewish culture and religion and that he 
could actually officiate 
at a service.  And so 
he began officiating in Spartanbu
rg and started writing sermons 
in English.  And did the whole 
thing, I mean he was quite rema rkable.  And as a 
result of that, the Jewish soldiers– there was a 
military base  in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Ca
mp Croft.  And so the soldiers, the Jewish 
soldiers who would some times come  to the syna
gogue and see Daddy, would come  to our little, 
poor apartment on weekends.  And 
on the porch– and we have little
 pictures with a Brownie, 
black and white that were taken of all these so
ldiers sitting out on the porch or out front on a 
Saturday afternoon, because it was a place to 
go.  Because they didn™t know anybody.  They 
were away from home.  It was ju
st kind of ironic, right
, that you™ve got–  and I™m sure the rest 
of the Jewish community was also ve ry fond of
 them, but they came to Mom and Dad because 
they were new in the community and very warm. 
 I don™t know whether they realized that this 

immi grant family had come to Spartanburg, 
South Carolina and were totally in a new 
environment.  I mean it™s always been, I™ve alwa
ys thought it™s been very rema rkable when you

think about it.  I mean, they didn™t stay in Ne
w York, where people spoke German.  I mean my 
mother and her sist ers sort of still speak Germ
an.  She has an accent.  But they came South and 
here™s my dad, writing sermons and officiating when he™s not inhis fairly me nial job at the 
factory.  Then some how the congr
egation in Gastonia, North Caro
lina, which was about seventy-
five miles away, I think, also had no rabbi.  And 
he got to Gastonia, because there was a fa mily 
name d Heilbronn, who were in Magdeburg, who we
re– that they knew in Germany.  And that 
fa mily, the Heilbronns, had owned a textile mill. 
 They were very well off.  And they had 
brought their whole, their ma nufact
uring facility over and they were living near Gastonia.  So, I 
think they contacted Dad to see if
 he couldn™t start helping them 
with services.  And so my dad 
started commuting between Spartanburg and Gastoni
a and officiating at se
rvices in Gastonia.  
And so after a couple of years, 
Daddy in the shirt fact
ory, let™s see, in Spartanburg the place he 
worked was called, yeah– Dixie Shirt Fact ory is 
the mill where he went to work.  He started 
moving up a little bit and became a shift manager 
and a foreman.  And learned essent ially how, 
the text ile knitting business, totally so me thing he
™d never done in his life.  Never knew anything 
about it.  And became very good at it.  And so, seve
ral years later, the family in Gastonia asked 
Dad or Mr. Heilbronn asked him if 
he wouldn™t come  to wor k for 
him as a, I think as a shift 
ma nager.  And then he also, when he got to 
Gastonia– and he invented
, ma de some  innovations 
on the machinery in their dye house.  But after 
Spartanburg– so we lived
 in Spartanburg about 
three years.  And it was, you know, 
people were, of course, very ni
ce to us, but–  and I started 
really a public school in Spartanburg, both my br ot
her– and my brother, let™s see, I was then, I 
would have been, let™s see in 1940 I would have b
een nine.  So we were in, I was like in the 
fourth, fifth and sixth grade.  And I was ki
nd of a novelty, obviously, immi grant son.  And 
people would ask questions about how it was on 
the boat.  So, the classrooms would start 
scheduling me  around as a speaker to other schools,
 because they had this 
little ten-year-old, who 
could talk about life in Germany and 
comi ng over on a boat and being Jewish. 
 
Q: So, did you talk about the plight of the Jews in Europe? 
 

A: I™m sure I did.  I mean, I essentially told, I thi
nk, told much of this story from the perspective of 
a ten-year-old.  If some body had taped it, I™m su
re there were more details that I don™t even 
reme mber, but it was, you know, it was sort 
of novel having some body– there was nobody else 
there.  And I was still probably speaking, well in
 Spartanburg certainly, spoke broken English.  I 
always reme mber when the first report card came 
out with all these numbers.  I said, well, what 
are these numbers?   When my parents wanted to 
find out what is this re
port card, with very good 
grades.  They were like nineties
 and things like that. you know. 
 And they didn™t know the first 
thing about socialization.  They
 didn™t know that when kids 
had parties, or you go to some body 
else™s house.  Everything was different.  The 
conventional things that you grow up with, the 
books, the stories, the Alice in Wonderland.  The 
children™s books in this country are totally 
different.  So some  of that was lost, but I though
t they did rema rkably well and we had a lot of 
very nice friends.  And I thought 
the teachers were very welcoming.  I still reme mber some of 
those teachers.  And the community was very 
accepting.  The Jewish community was pretty 
wealthy by and large, because most of them were 
store owners, as they te
nded to be.  By that 
time, all lot of them all, like so many others in
 these smaller Southern towns, their fathers and 
mothers had come  to the South, to these communiti
es, selling rags or generally as salespeople.  

And then a lot of them decided to stay and built
, opened stores.  And the war years we re fairly 
recent, so most of them were retail merchants.
  And some of them were like Heilbronn... there

were several factory owners, who were very well-
to-do.  So, there really– people, most of the 
kids were from much more well-t
o-do home s and I think to some  
extent, that™s why so ma ny of 
our own associations, we  were always very co
mfortable with working people, who were not 
necessarily Jewish.  Whe n you™re living really in 
a Protestant environment in the South.  So, I 
don™t know that we were ever conscious, for exampl
e, to the same  degree of anti-Semitism to the 
extent that it existed even the
n.  It was never a problem.  We  ne
ver, my parents were not in the 
country club set, so they didn™t have to worry 
about whether they could get in to the country 
club.  But– 
 
Q: Was your lack of socialization a problem 
at all or did you, were you, did you really feel 
confident enough that 
it didn™t affect you? 
 

A: Oh, I think it went very well.  I mean, my folks were very permissive about– and I think I 
tended to– the friends that you ma de in those ye
ars, tended to be either in your neighborhood 

directly,  and there were a few kids that were 
in the neighborhood that you played with, and then 
children, your friends we re also, friends who 
did well, if you were ma king good grades.  The 
kids you hang out with or that you learn and then
 their parents hear about you.  So I spent some  
time in those years, it was a little more– proba
bly it was more mi ddle-classy than my parents 
were.  Kids whose home s were a li
ttle better.  But I think it went
 pretty we ll.  I didn™t play any 
ball really until I was really– we played marbles, 
we played capture  the fl ag.  I got into scouting 
in a big way.  And when we went to Gastonia, 
we  moved to Gastonia then and I went into the 
seventh grade and my br other was in the third grade.  And in the,
 I think in the seventh, in the 
junior high school I developed a lo
t more confidence.  And I think 
by the time I was in the eighth 
grade I was president of the class.
  In high school I was president 
of the class in my, I think my 
sophomore and my senior years.  I became pretty Americanized.  I was very involved in 

scouting, which was a great help, and in some  othe
r civic stuff.  And I worked after school.  I 
think what gets you off the ground– when I was tw
elve, I think, you could st
art at twelve, I had 
my first newspaper route.  And started deliveri
ng papers for the–  actua
lly I think I ma y have 
delivered papers in Spartanburg.  I think I deliv
ered the Spartanburg paper just the last few 
months before we left, on a bicycle.  My parent
s bought me  a  bike and that was a big deal to get 
a bicycle.  It™s interesting it was a big deal to
 buy– I got a fountain, the 
first fountain pen.  They 
bought me  a  fountain pen, when I was in fourth or fi
fth grade.  That was a 
big thing.  They really 
never– they spent all their money, I mean to th
e extent that they had any money left it was 
always for the kids, either litt
le gifts like that, I mean we™d– 
 and you didn™t have television in 
those days, and you didn™t have– you had a radio. 
 Dad didn™t get a car.
   We actually, the 
fa mily, there was another fa mily living in our 
building, that had a son, who was our age, who, 
and  I reme mber we drove to Tryon, North 
Carolina and saw Sergeant York, you know, the 
movie?   Did you ever see the movie?  Gary Cooper. 
 It™s a wonderful picture.  He was a war hero 
in the First World Wa r or Second?   He was fr
om Kentucky, from Tennessee.  It was a Gary 
Cooper movie.  It™s a marvelous pi cture.  
He was a pacifist, who enlisted and became the 
Congressional Medal of Honor 
winner and then came back home .  He wa s a ma rks ma n from 
shooting wild turkeys, is where he learned to s
hoot.  But then one week it was on, and when we 
returned it was Pearl Harbor Day, it was December sevent h, 1941, when we went with the 

Carver family to that mo vie in Tryon.  But it wa
s, you know, I think that™s 
part of our heritage.  
As some  people would say, we we
re poor and didn™t know it.  Th
ere was always plenty of food

and my dad was very involved in the Jewish comm
unity there and subsequently in Gastonia.  But 
those early years, when you think about it, we
 had such an enormous adjustme nt to ma ke. 
 

Q: I was going to ask you about that.  It seems th
at, well I™ve heard other people talk about arriving 
in New York and there being a lot of encourag
ement for Je ws who were immi grating to go to 
various other parts of the country.  And so ma ny 
people just didn™t want to do that and felt so 
strongly about that, that they stayed in 
New York even though there was no economi c  
opportunity at all.  And I guess this is more 
of an observation than 
a question, but your dad 
seems to have been somebody who was very open
-minded and aware of opportunities, and that 
probably shaped your life a lot, 
too.  I mean, being a child in 
a situation where you experienced 
this extreme disadvantage through having your ch
ildhood interrupted so much, and then having 
your fa mily really be broken apart, and ma ny of th
em killed.  But for you to be able to arrive in 
this new place and be kind of honored for who y
ou are and what your history is–  it™s kind of 
different than what Jewish kids in Ne w York, 
who were immi grating were experiencing for the 
most part, it seems to me .  There were so ma
ny immigrants, and so ma ny survivors and people 
who weren™t really overall encouraged to 
talk about what had happened to them. 
 

A: Well yeah, I mean, I suppose that going– I don™
t know why my Dad did not explore a little 
more about the teaching.  I don™t know that, whethe
r, how he felt New York– we were living in 
a very crowded place and I think he  wanted to get us
 out of there.  Because  that apartment, big as 
it was, had my mother™s parents, and her two sister
s.  And we sort of were just, they would just 
let us live there.  But I don™t think he wanted to st
ay there.  So he set a
bout pretty early trying to 
figure out what he could do and how to earn a 
living basically and br
ing money home, enough.  
And that New York City, whether he felt too hemme d-
in there, or there just  really wasn™t very 
much for him to do, because he couldn™t be a teac
her, he coul dn™t be  a rabbi,   and he couldn™t 
get a job.  There were so ma ny people looking for 
work, as you say, and it was this immi grant  
situation.  But it did, I™m sure, shaped my life, 
from the time we went South.  But I think, I don™t 
know that he always– I mean, you know, they had a 
very strong work ethic.  My parents have a 
strong work ethic.  And so they encouraged me  
or were not opposed to seeing me  have a paper 
route at a very young age.  And then, I mean that™s
 a very liberating experience.  I always tell 
people, I reme mber getting up at five in the mo
rning, and going out to get the paper and then 
going by the coffee store and putting 
that nickel down on the lunch counter and saying, ﬁI™d like 
a cup of coffee.ﬂ (Laughing.)  I mean I was pr
obably not much higher than the stool.  But you 
know when you have a newspaper route and 
you start putting a littl
e mone y in your own 
pocket–  So I always had a job of one sort or an
other.  I mean my parents just didn™t have any 
extra money to– and we knew that, because we
 knew how they lived.  Whether there mi ght 
have been small, I guess there mi ght have been 
a small allowance at one point, but after that  
newspaper route, I delivered pa
pers at home for a while and th
en I started... I was telling Reva
10
 
here the other day, my fi scal director, I hadn™
t thought about it, some body downstairs was, some  
of these people sell Home Interiors, and they do 
lot of, sell things.  I wa
s always selling things, 
when I was thirteen, I started selling statione
ry and greeting cards around the, knocking on doors. 
Had a little– within  a year I ha
d a little business.  Had a whole 
room ful l  of stationery and 
greeting cards for all occasions.  And then I 
was going to the factor
y owners and selling 
Christmas cards to businesses.  Then I starte
d working in town after school for the Jewish 
me rchants.  I was always working, doing some  kind 
of work.  And it didn™t 
really get in the way.

I mean, but kids–people– all of those experien
ces help you appreciate the way other people 
live, especially working people.  Wo me n you work
ed with back then, and their families, and 
money™s tight and how you ma ke it and don™t ma ke it,
 and so you have an appreciation for that.  
And my mom and dad, my mother 
was basically always worked at home.  She never worked.  I 
mean, she was a very traditional mother, in 
that she was a housekeeper and cooked, did the 
cooking.  And later on, I think, when my brother and 
my sister is ten years– my sister was born 
in 1946
11
.  So she™s fifteen years younger than I am
, eleven years younger than my brother and 
was not initially expected, I think. But Mom, af
t e r my sister was born, a few years later, she 
finally became, decided she wanted to work, and became a sales lady in one of the large 
departme nt stores, where she worked for a long tim
e.  And I think it did a lot for her, she had 
never worked in any store.  But she™s a ve
ry warm, very outgoing woma n and was everybody™s 
buddy.  And so, she was a very good salesperson, but 
it was a new experience for her.  I think it 
was an enormous adjustme nt for her.  And rea
lly for Dad.  And so when I, I think– anyway, 
scouting, during the– we were a little, I suppos
e people, where else in the South, when you 
think about it, with this history, being, havingpeople recognize you, electyou to be president of 

the class or some thing was quite 
a nice thing. But I think scouting, an
d scouting did a lot of that.  
I became an Eagle Scout, and was a counselor in 
a scout camp for several, in the summe rs for 
several years, very close to the sc
out executive.  In fact, he– this is
 really kind of off t he subject, 
but it™s interesting when we say how things aff
ect your lives.  The scout 
executive in Ga stonia, 
ma rried a woma n, who was a Cherokee Indian.  He wa
s a, his name  was Schiele.  He was a park 
ranger for much of his life, and then he got into
 scouting.  And he also, during his ranger days, 
learned to stuff, to ma ke, he was a taxidermist. 
 He amassed a large collection of animals that he 
had mounte d.  And his wife collected,  and together
 they also collected a 
lot of Native American 
things, since she was a Cherokee Indian.  And when
 we were, in the summer in our camp we put 
on a large Indian pageant every Thursday night.  
The pageant of Hiawatha.  I was Hiawatha for 
several years and my br other was Minihaha. They™d put a wi g on him and I would paddle a 
canoe in the lights at night and 
bring him up.  But  Bud Schiele, when he retired, he gave this 
collection to the town of Gastoni a and said, I™d like to start a lit
tle museum here.  So, he gave 
that collection and began a natural history museum
, which today is about a square block.  He™s 
no longer there, but they™ve deve
loped this wonderful museum of natural history with outdoor 
walking trails and some  really beautiful– it™s quite
 remarkable in the sense 
that it™s also twenty 
miles fr om Charlotte, which has a very large sc
ience museum.  But the point I™m ge tting to, is 
that after, when I was at, later went to Duke 
University, I was a chemistry ma jor before I was a 
lawyer.  We  can talk mor e  about that if you want 
to.  I™ve always had an 
interest in science and 
in this region here, we are be
hind, I mean educationally we™re 
still behind.  We ™ve caught up.  
But I™ve always had an interest, as much as a 
result of that experience and seeing Bud Schiele™ s 
museum grow, in starting a scien
ce museum here.  And so outside 
of my  work, my major activity 
has been involved with this organization that we 
began, and in the last legi
slature, we finally got 
two and a half million dollars a
nd we™re going to put a planetariu
m with a very sophisticated 
projection system out here at the community co
llege.  And the guy, and in fact in our little 
offices are next door, and we have
 a picture of the Schiele Muse
um on the wall.  Because seeing 
that effort work and flourish in the small to
wn of Gastonia gave me
 some  real thought, idea 
about the fact that we can do it he
re.  I think a lot of, I mean I 
think scouting gave me a lot in 
terms of values apart fr om the Judaism that is in my fa mily.

Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah? 
 

A: Uh huh.  Ba r Mitzvah in Gastonia, North Carolina. 

 

Q: Did you prepare for that with your father? 

 

A: No.  Now, my father, after he did this co
mmuting thing, we eventually, we then mo ved to 
Gastonia, where I was in the seventh grade and 
he– when he began working full time, actually 
he worked in the little community called Lowe
ll, North Carolina, which is about seven miles 
away.  And he assisted the rabbi.  Some ti me s be
tween rabbis he would do... he often acted as the 
cantor during services, and he often was on the pu
lpit.  Some times he was not.  During the high 
holiday services especially, lik
e Yom Kippur, where people pray 
and they stay in the synagogue 
all day, the rabbi needs some body to take turns with. 
 But he was very close to most of the rabbis 
that were there.  The rabbi I was Bar Mitzvah was named Bill Silverman.  And we had a, it was a 

very large group.  I suspect there were as ma ny people who were not Jewish in the synagogue as 

there were, a lot of fr iends, and my father had all of his fr iends fr om the mill that he worked with 

every day.  He was, he became an office ma nager ther e, after, in addition to his working daily 

around the, as a shift manager, but he became sort
 of a supervisor in Mr
. Heilbronn™s mill.  And 
then by the time  I was thirteen, in the seventh 
or eighth grade, there we
re school friends, and 
mother had friends.  So, it was a very nice congre
gation in Gastonia.  There were probably fifty 
Jewish fa milies.  And so I was Bar Mitzvah, and 
my brother was Bar Mitzvah.   Can™t reme mber 
who the rabbi was when he was there.  And my 
s i ster, nowadays they also have what they call 
Bat Mitzvahs for girls, where girls go through th
e same  thing.  Or they have what they call 
confirma tion classes.  I think she did that.  We  st
ayed pretty active, but 
like a lot of other kids 
who are in the South in high school, after that 
fourteen, fifteen year old, you sort of– you™re 
there Friday nights, but teenagers,
 unless they have a real tie to, 
unless you™re in a Conservative 
or an Orthodox fa mily that is ve ry traditiona l,
 which you get away from the Sunday school.  And 
your next connections with other Jews are– I 
mean, Charlotte has a large Jewish community 
and there were a lot of children our age, boys a
nd girls, me n and wome n.  Then when you get to 
college.  But we had the Bar Mitzvah.  And you 
know, my father, peoplewe
re very aware of the 
Jewish community, I think, in Gastonia.  I was alwa
ys, in retrospect, after I worked in the Civil 
Rights Division and after I was in the service, I al
ways felt a little sad th
at the Jewish community 
was not a little more assertive about desegregatio
n.  But I think the store 
owners were all afraid 
to lose their business.  
 

Q: You think that if they weren™t afraid to lose th
eir business, that they would have been inclined to 
push for desegregation?    
 

A: Oh, I think that– I mean, Judaism is founded on th
e theory of Justice.  I me an, I think it was as 
bad for them to look the other way as it was for,
 I mean churches were segregated.  It was a 
segregated life.  Although you grow up with it, y
ou don™t pay attention to it.  I mean you just 
aren™t aware of it.  You have, well Spartanburg 
and Gastonia.  Well, Gast
onia, as I was growing 
up, I think– .

Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number three, side 
A of an interview with John Rosenberg. 
 
A: Yeah, we were talking about the Jewish commun
ities in these towns and what they might have 
done.  I think it™s always 
hard to look back and say, but I th
ink the answer would have been if 
they had felt they could have done more, they mi ght
 have done more.  I think that they were in 
the business establishment just the way– I mean th
ey were living in the South and they were not 
going to be trail blazers, because
 they would have been ostraci
zed.  I me a n, if you look at what 
was going on in the South in those earlier years a
nd even later years when I was in the service– 
well, I was saying in hi gh school, I think there we
re some  time s that there were some  occasions 
at high school with kids who were from the, fr
om the black school... there 
were a few social, not 
social engage me nts, but some  things were you te
nded to see each other.  Or if you were working 
together, where they were stock boysŠI work
ed in departme nt stores for ma ny yearsŠyou 
would run into them.  But it just was a– accepte
d way of life.  And I have just– it did not 
really, even in college, I mean you he ard more 
about Jews not getting into the country club, and 
that kind of stuff.  And t hat there were incident
s from time to time, but it was never, I don™t think 
I was ever conscious of anti-Semitism.  But it was really not until I was in the Service, working 

with other officers who were Af
rican-American, I mean the Service was the first major arena 
where there was desegregation in this country, 
the military.  And you know, I have told the st ory 
that when I came back from– we brought an airp
lane back fr om England one year, by way of 
Iceland and Greenland.  Ca me  back
 to New York and then two of us, the radar operator on my 
plane, I was the navigator, was a fellow na med Abe Jenkins, who was from South Carolina, who 

was black.  And he and I got on th
e train in New York together to
 come  home .  And when we got 
to Wa shington, he got up all of a sudden and said, 
ﬁI™ll see you when we get back.ﬂ  And I said, 
ﬁ Where are you going? ﬂ  And he said, ﬁI™m going to
 the back of the train, where the blacks are.ﬂ  
And I said, ﬁWhat? ﬂ   And he said, ﬁYeah you better,
 that™s where, I need to go there, otherwise 
we™re going to have some  trouble.ﬂ  And he did.  
And I think it was an inci
dent that changed my 
life, really.  Because I never– 
I was really outrage d and aggrav
ated and thought we™ve got to do 

some thing about that or eventually ma ybe I can he
lp to do some thing about that or whatever the 
thought was.  But that was– so, it was not eas
y for– it wasn™t going to
 come  without court 
action and others, but I think that
 the Jews are no less, thos e Je wish communities are and the 

people who are there, are no less, ma ybe no mor e  to
 blame than their other counterparts.  But it 
was their economi c circumstances and they were not
 willing to speak out or if they did, I don™t 
know where they did.  I mean, the fe w people w
ho did speak out, until there was more of a 
movement, couldn™t stay in thei r communities.  
I mean I worked with a man, a lawyer in the 
Civil Rights Division, who came from Fort Smith, Ar
kansas and he started trying to be, I me an 
he was speaking out and the next thing he knew,
 he had no law practice left and he was in 
Washington, D.C.  So, it™s more easily said than
 done, but when you think about the history of 
the persecution in the, that the 
Jews have had, and the Holocaust 
and all of the things that are 
behind us, you– that they™ve gone through, you woul
d have hoped that Jews would have been 
more sympathetic to the situation that  blacks f
aced every day.  And not quite as much of a 
willing pa rticipant.  It™s easier 
said than done.  It™s just  some thing that bothers me , you know, 
philosophically it™s hard to defend it.

Q: So, then was the time  that you were in the 
Air Force the first time  that you had had close 
personal contact with black peopl
e and for med friendships?    
 
A: Yeah, right, I think so.  I went
 to, when I went to Duke, I went
 to Duke on a scholarship which 
terminated.  Because I got, the scholarship I wa
s given through a trustee of Duke, who was from 
Gastonia.  I can™t reme mber wh
at his prominence was, but he 
was on the Board.  And he died 
about six months after I went to Duke.  And I 
had started working in the dining halls and they 

told me I made too much money and didn™t need 
a scholarship, which mi ght have been all right.  
I didn™t have any trouble, I just
 worked my way through Duke.  But he, but Duke had a quota on 

Jewish students even in those years.  And it wa
s before the years that there were any bl ack 
athletes to speak of, before Duke had any.  So, 
I was just sort of thinking back, were there any 
blacks in my  life in those earlier years?  There we ren™t.  And when I came  out of the Service, out 

of Duke, I went into the ROTC.  And when I wa
s in the military, that  was the fi rst time where I 
have any– and growing up in this 
country, yeah, thinking back on it. 
 

Q: I wanted to ask you about, when you were talk
ing about your experiences in Boy Scouts, and 
your earlier years in Gastonia.  I™m
 wondering if there was ever a 
conflict between your Jewish 
identity and your Jewish practice 
and your social life?   Did people 
expect you to be Christian and 
to be participating in things as a Chri
stian?   Wa s that ever a problem for you? 
 

A: No, it was very interesting, I think.  Because th
e Scout troop, all the Scout troops were sponsored 
by churches.  And the Scout tr
oop I was a me mber of was spons
ored by the Associate Refor m, 
ARP.  They were called the Associate Refor m 
Pre s byterians.  And I think they™d had two or 
three other Eagle Scouts from the Jewish communit
y.  And so, the answer is no.  I mean I think 
they were cognizant of the fact that we were
 Jewish.  And I don™t know that anybody ever tried 
to sort of convert anyone.  But the troop, when 
I got to scout camp as a counselor one summer, I 
was sort of– I wasn™t– One of my jobs was to
 arrange the services 
and ma ny of the scout 
troops had mi nisters along with them or they were 
their scout ma sters.  A
nd so, I found myself in 
the position of being, sort of the 
associate mi nister to these folk
s and I learned all the, ma ny of 
the hymns.  And as we grew up, I went to chur
ch a few times.  I certainly went to that 
Presbyterian church.  But I think 
it was just a healthy respect.  I think people in the church 

appreciated, I mean were respectful of the Jewi
sh community and that religion.  And often times 
people came to those services.  So, I don™t know 
that, I think, you know, we often, the Schieles 
encouraged me  to do that actually, the scout ma st
er.  To be– and I often time s did the Vesper 
services for the campers who were there over 
the weekend.  And there would probably be not 
much Jesus, but I would read from the Old a
nd the New Testament and we  would sing the hymns 
that they knew, and it didn™t bot
her me .  Now it mi ght very well have bothered ma ny other, 
not– other Jewish men mi ght have said, ﬁWell you™re
 just stupid.  What are you doing this for? ﬂ  
Or you know, ﬁ Why are you being a mi nister in th
is largely Pr otestant
 camp and sort of 
embracing their way of having a service? ﬂ  But I di
dn™t have any problem with that.  My parents 
didn™t have any problem with it. 
 

Q: I was going to ask you, did your, do you think you
r parents taught you Judaism in a way that 
allowed you to think of that 
as not being a contradiction?

A: I think my parents were very 
tolerant of other religions.  I th
ink my father– I mean my mother 
basically grew up in a small, country town and 
was Jewish, but had ma ny more associations with 
non-Jewish people.  Now my fath
er had this very strong Jewi sh background.  And there was 
actually a period of my life after Icame  out of the Service that I 
had given some  cons ideration to 
going to Rabbinical school.  And in the Reform
 move me nt, you know, the Refor m Rabbinate is 
not so different from the mi nister™s
 life.  It isn™t all pr
ayer.  It™s social wor
k, visiting with people, 
around with the Jewish doctrine.  So, I think my 
parents, when my father came South a nd started 
working in the factory and realized that it wa
s not going to ma ke sense to be kosher and that 

maybe bacon and eggs were good together.  I thi
nk he essentially embraced the idea of Refor m 
Judaism and was pretty– and since he worked almost all the time with folks who were not 

Jewish.  I think only the factory owner was 
Jewish, Heilbronn.  That you, you just adapt 
culturally, much more, which the Reform congrega
tions have done.  If you go to Israel, Saturday 
all the stores are closed, right?   The Sa bbath is Sa
turday.  And Friday night to Saturday night.  In 
this country, it™s all on Sunday. 
 I me an there was never such a thing as Sunday school, but 
Jewish Reform congregations have Sunday school.
  And they basically 
adapted to living in a 
Protestant society.  And I think we did that, a
nd of course, you know, I think my father, it was a 
big change in our fa mily to have me  ma rry
 some one who wasn™t Jewish.  Although it was 
probably less pronounced because we  were both a 
little older than if– I 
mean, as time has gone 
on it has become  much more common than it was. 
 But then my sister 
ma rried a young ma n from 
Eastern North Carolina, who wasn™t Jewish.  
They subsequently divorced, but she™s had a 
significant other for ma ny years, who™s not Je
wish also.  So, I don™t know how, you know my 
father, I assume  he came to grips with that.  I 
think they both felt comfort a ble about their sons 
and then their daughter, who were, you know, were 
sort of achievers in the community and were 
happy with their lives.  And everybody likes to hear
 good things about their kids.  And so I don™t 
think they were going to throw up barriers.  I don™t 
know that it was ever ve
rbalized.  I think my 
father had a very– you know, he was very strong 
with his own convictions and had some  very 
strong ideas, but again, you know, if 
your kids go in a certain dire
ction– raising children is as 
difficult for anybody in school.  And if they pal 
around with, in a society where very few people 
are Jewish, to say, ﬁWell, you can™t go out with
 them or you s houldn™t go to that camp  or you 
shouldn™t do this or you shouldn™t do 
that,ﬂ it™s much harder.  And 
I think they were always sort 
of adapting to where we were.  I think.  I mean I 
think it shows terr ific fl exibility on their part.  
My mother was always much more of a social 
person, much more than he, which mo re than my 

father.  My dad was a pretty private person.  A
nd he was very– he read and he worked and he 
read.  When he was home, did the dishes, sa
t down and read.  And he had this enormo us 
knowledge of Jewish history and Jewish religion. 
 And there were very few people, other than 
the rabbi, that he really enjoyed having long conv
ersations with.  I mean they were just in a 
different world.  I mean he would do his work an
d liked his work in a very exacting way.  But 
this fellow, when I asked you about Mrs. Hirs
chfield earlier, the person who volunteered– her 
husband was a scient ist, who came  over here andbecame, and went into the textile work.   
 

Q: Was his name William? 

 

A: It™s Fr ances, wait.  Her name was Frances Hirsch
fi eld, his name  was– I think it mi ght have been 
William. 
 

Q: Yeah, now I™m re me mbe r ing who they are.  Y
eah.  I think they™re st ill volunteering there.

A: Well, she just died.  But he was... he died a 
few years back in Gastonia.  He  was, lived in 
Huntsville, Alabama, be fore they mo ved to Gast
onia.  And he came to Ga stonia to be, like the 
chief chemist for the factory, dye work and things like that.  And my dad could, would, enjoyed 

having him to talk to.  And even in his retireme nt, when they moved to Florida, he– one of his 

good friends was the rabbi for that c
ongregation.  So he was not a, he was in some  ways a pretty, 
a very private person.  And I think he didn™
t either understand, not
– understand ma y be the 
wrong word.  He did not always 
appreciate what we were doing in
 our spare time .  He didn™t 
grow up in scouting, but I think he really appr
eciated what we  learned in scouting.  And the 
people that he me t, the other scout ma
sters and the activities that we did. 
 

Q: Was your brother a scout, too? 

 

A: My brother was a scout.  And he became an Eagl
e Scout in that same  Presbyterian chur ch.  He 
endured a summer with me  that he says he™ll ne
ver forget, because I was the scout ma ster in 
charge of the cabin when he was a few years younger and was a camper.  And I induced him to 

be Minihaha or twisted his arm or
 the Schieles twisted his arm.  
But– so, when– my dad in that 
way was pretty, I think, tolerant of 
what we did and just let us do it. 
 

Q: Was being Jewish important to
 you at the time, fr om a young age? 
 

A: Oh sure.  I think it™s always been important 
to me and is important to me , today.  And you know, 
I think it™s had a profound effect on my life.  I 
talked about it during– I 
mean, Judaism has been 
part of me  all the way through and I guess I™m pre
tty conscious of being Je
wish.  Not that I think 
about it every day, but it™s a very attractive relig
ion, I think.  It™s very 
simple.  Its principles 
ma ke a lot of sense to me, if one is going to believe in a higher being.  And people are aware that 
I am Jewish.  And I spend some  ti me  talking about Judaism, some ti mes in schools, some times to 
civic gr oups or Passover, that sort of thing.  But,
 I mean, nothing to necessarily flout, it™s just the 
way it is.  And then of course, I said my wife is
 not Jewish.  But then we have a small Quaker 
contingent in the mountains that I participate 
with.  So, we put those two things together, 
some thing I probably wouldn™t have predicted year
s ago either.  I™m sure that all of this 
Holocaust history is very much a part of, or ha
s contributed a great deal
 to what I™ve been doing 
in my later life , in this work that  I do a
nd the work I did in the Civil Rights Division. 
 

Q: And I™d really like to discuss that mo re and 
ma ybe it would ma ke more sense to do that after 
we™ve really discussed your work
 here and with the Civil Rights
 Division so that
 it can be put 
more in context.  Do you think?   Or do you want to say some thing about it now? 
 

A: Well, what were you thinking?   Wha t
 else did you want to talk about? 
 

Q: Well, your later years (laughing)
,  the rest of your lif
e that we haven™t ta
lked about yet.   
 

A: Isee. 

 

Q: But I definitely am interested in hearing 
how your Holocaust, when you say that your Holocaust 
experiences that had a profound ef
fect on your subsequent work.

A: Well, I think the family, I think comi ng to this
 country– I think we™ve al
ways been grateful for 
the opportunity that we™re here, from the time  we
 came.  And I think my parents were always 
very cognizant, emphasized that.  I always re
me mber right after we, when we moved to 
Spartanburg in those early days, like ma ny other 
immigrant families, you™d have a picture on the 
wall of Franklin Roosevelt and th
e St atue of Liberty or some thing else.  And I reme mb er, I think 
I reme mber this incident: when the immigrati
on people or the FBI showed up one day on our 
door in GastoniaŠwas it Gastonia or Spartanbur
g? Šand they came and took out– you were not 
allowed to have a short-wave radio and you were not allowed to have binoculars, because you 

mi ght spy on some body.  And we had an old mo noc
ular, one of those things that seafaring 
captains go– do– use.  And they took that.  And th
ey saw the picture on the wall and they were 
very embarrassed in what they were doing.  
I mean they, my parents were very nice– 
 

Q: So, I™m sorry, it was just immi grants th
at weren™t allowed to have these things? 
 

A: Right, yeah, if you weren™t Ameri
can citizens.  We were aliens, foreigns, aliens.  And eventually, 
years later they brought them back.  They return
ed them.  I don™t know if it was right after we 
got our citizenship papers.  My parents applied to
 become  citizens, then 
in 1945, after five years, 
took their test and got their citi
zenship.  We  went to Charlotte. 
 Federal judges often talk about 
the most poignant experiences, how often or how ma ny of them rema rk ab
out the thrill they 
ma ke, they have in presiding over the citizensh
ip swearings-in.  And we
 went to– my parents 
were sworn in in Charlotte.  We  went  across th
e street.  And I think it
 was– I think that the 
restaurant – we went to a restaurant .  I think it wa
s the first time I ever ate out in my life, that 

they ever went out.  It was a little diner across 
the street , after the swea
ring-in ceremony.  But, 
and I think that my work, going into the military, 
in part  and then working in the Divi si on and 
ma ybe the work I do here is all, in some  ways
– I never viewed it as a 
sacrifice, but I think 
having a life in public service, in a wa y, is help
ing to try to make this
 country a better place to 
live in and gi ve back a little bit. 
 I mean there are lots of ways of
 giving back, if that™s the right 

word, but at least helping to contribute to making 
this a better society a
nd not necessa rily being 
governed by the dollar sign, which, you know, we all 
have an opportunity to do.  But in that way, 
I think, all of this, at least I th
ink that whether it was my parent
s or my Judaism, it all kind of 
come s together in some  way that you– I mean it™
s a real privilege to do what I do and get paid 
for it.  And it was that way in the Civil Rights 
Division, to have a position where you can help to 
provide better opportunities for 
African-Ame ricans in this country, by working, by using the 
legal system to make, to break these barriers dow
n.  And to do the same thing in my present job 
or what I™ve been doing for almost thirty years 
for poor people, to give them a chance to be on 
the same  playing field or to level the playing fiel
d for them, at least when they™re tryi ng to make 

their way through the legal system, or when they™re in trouble.  And to ma ke the legal system 

work for them, which they wouldn™t be able to a
fford unless it was for the lawyers and staff in 

this program that I™ve been in ch
arge of for a number of years. 
 

Q: During the early years that you 
were in the United States and 
Spartanburg and Gastonia, as the 
war is developing, were you aware of what was 
happening in Europe to the Jews?   We re you 
able to follow that?

A: I don™t think so.  I don™t know when we found out th
ey were all killed, that
 the family was killed, 
or what was– you know, in 1944– or even that th
ese ships that were not allowed in this 
country, all these that were going around and ar
ound, went back to Germany, Holland.  I don™t 
know whether there was any contact.  I don™t th
ink there was.  I don™t 
think my– that™s a good 
question.  Whether my fa ther knew where his brothe
r was, that they were alive.  I don™t think 
they did have  any contact.  Because, and when we
 looked at those records, I think from being 
with Mother, that that was the fi rst time that sh
e knew for sure.  I mean that we had heard, the 

thing from this– but I don™t thi
nk there was any contact.  I don™
t know.  I was still too much in 
school.  I mean, you know, it seems like it jumps from high school.  It seems like you™ve always 

known the story of the Holocaust.  But whether we
 knew that that was happening when, let™s see 
I was, ‚44, I would have been thirteen, in the 
seventh grade.  What 
are your, what do you know 
about that?  
 

Q: Well, the st uff that filtered through the pre
ss was sketchy and some ti me s you™d get news about 
what was happening to the Jews, but it wasn™t  really until after the war when the libera tors were  

encountering the camps and involve
d with liberating a lo
t of them that they
 really knew the 
extent of what was happening and that, that started to
 really, that started to 
really reach the press.  
It wouldn™t have been until ‚45, probably.  And defi
nitely as far as keeping in contact, that would 
have been really hard. 
 

A: I mean that™s what I remember, I me an that™s
 my  thinking.  You read these stories about the 
Germans letting the American Red Cross into so me
 of their camps and cleaning them up and all 
of that stuff.  And that they did visit some  of th
e camps, right?  At least right after the war.  But I 
don™t know– 
 

Q: The camps that the Red Cross– 
 
A: I mean after the war began.  Huh? 

 

Q: The camps that the Red Cross visited were clea
ned up and altered for the me dia, and ma de into 
kind-of stages. 
 

A: Right.  But I, I mean that™s all I know.  I don™t th
ink my father and mother had any idea that they 
were alive or where they were until after the 
war.  We  don™t really know what happened to the 
fa mily in Holland, I don™t think.  And Frankfurt, 
the fa mily in Frankfurt.  I think we know 
they™re, did not live.  And that, 
I™m not sure we– I don™t think I could find the record.  Trying to 
reme mber what his first name  was, whether that wa
s another de Vries.  But it™s– I have a cousin 
who did this fa mily tree and he drew a fa mily
 tree like a tree with 
limbs and with how ma ny 
immediate relatives on my father™s
 side and cousins and cousins.  I mean when you™ve got eight 
children, and there are cousins that we™ve never me t 
and what happened to them all.  I just don™t 
think there was any real comm
unication in those years.   
 

Q: Do you remember, do you reme mbe r  learning ab
out it later?   Or do 
you reme mber what was 
going on in your fa mily in 1945 when you star
ted to learn about what was happening?

A: Well, I mean I was in, let™s see in ‚4
5 I was fourteen.  You know, I don™t have a good 
recollection.  We  just had a reunion in Gastoni a, North Carolina and one of my teachers was 
there.  She™s living out west. She was, it happened 
that she was the newest  teacher to come to the 
high school, so she™s only four year
s older, or five years older than some  of us.  At the time she 
was an algebra teacher.  And shehad her grade book with my name  in
 it.  She still had her grade 
book from those years.  I had very
 little recollection a
bout having been in her class.  And so I 
don™t know whether other people have have be
tter me mories about– I mean whether you you 
start to lose your long– I mean, 
how good is your me mory?   Your me mo ry is probably not too 
bad for high school days.   
 

Q: Yeah, it seems like me mories change so much over time. 

 

A: So, I don™t know what I reme mber about German
y.  I mean if you go to– we went to services 
Friday night as we all did and you listened to wh
at happened.  I™m sure we were conscious of 
what, I mean, just like everybody else when they did go in ‚45 and liberate the camps–

Q: Yeah, tape number three, side B– tape num

A: Well, I was just saying I think that Be tty, Sä
mmy™s wife, came out of the concentration camp 
alive.  And so there, she was vi
sited a couple of time s.  We  re a
lly did not dwell on anything with 
her, I think, other than 
the fact Sämmy was her husband and 
that she had ma de it through, I don™t 
know– and that™s when we went to see her. 
 And of course, that was in 1960– it was 1970, 
which would have been twenty-fiv
e years after she went to Isr
ael, after the war was over.   
 

Q: She went to Israel  in ‚45? 

 

A: She went in, or ‚46, right after she got out.  A
nd my father and mother, I think he was in touch 
with her and had seen her.  I mean they went over before we did– it was some where in there– 

well ma ybe they didn™t.  I don™t think they went to
 Israel until after he retired, which would have 
been in 1966.  When he was sixty-
five he retired from this fact
ory in North Carolina.  And he 
went, they moved to Florida.  And then in their 
retireme nt they took some , 
they started traveling.  
So I think they had corresponded pretty regularly, 
Betty and my father.  But, so it was almost 
twenty years.  I think she had relatives in Isr
ael also.  But I don™t think they knew very much 

about what was going on at all.  No, I™m not 
a fount of knowledge about
 that.  You probably 
have more fr om other interviews about that. 
 Did you talk to any people who knew very much 
about, who were in this country, who knew very
 much about what was happening in the camps 
in the ‚40s? 
 

Q: No.  And I haven™t talked to a whole lot of peopl
e who were in this country
 during those years.  I 
mean most of the people I™ve ta
lked to came right afterwards. 
 

A:  Came  after the war. 

 

Q:  Right. 

 

A: You haven™t talked to many second-generation 
people like me.  My sister was born in this 
country.  She was born in Gastonia.  I still sp
eak like fourth-grade Ge
rman, and can understand 
it.  My brother can speak a littl
e bit.  My sister doesn™t know 
any German.  Do you wa nt to see 
any of this stuff?   I mean you™re welcome to– 
I don™t know what there is to see, but I think 

you™re doing it primarily on tape.  We have birth 
certificates.  I don™t know where my father™s is, 
couldn™t find it this morning.  I have that Gedenk
 book in the other room.  I™ll show you that.   
 

Q: Yeah, sure, yeah.  I™d love to s
ee some  of the pictures you me ntioned. 
 

A: Well the pictures, unfortunately
 are with my mother.  She ha
s the old book.  And I didn™t– I 
almost brought them back because nobody ever looks at them.  And I happened to look at them 

on this trip because I had a little time.  For one
 thing, I didn™t know what had happened to them.

I was afraid we mi ght have mi splaced them.  The y
 went back and forth a couple of times.  When 
my mother moved from Florida up to Maryland
– my dad passed away in 1989, I think, and she 
stayed another year or two in Florida, where he
r sister lived in the same  place called Ce ntury 
Village.  Then she move d to Chevy Chase.  Sh
e™s about fifteen mi nutes from my brother in a 
high rise for the elderly.  So a lot of stuff 
got moved around, but she does have a lot of the 
photographs.  And it™s nice, interesting to go back and look at them.   
 
Q: So, changing the subject a little 
bit, when you were in college at 
Duke, you were really interested 
at that point in science?  
 Is that what you 
thought you were going to
 have a career in? 
 

A: I enjoyed, I like chemistry and physics and had 
a very good chemistry teacher.  I also like doing 
sales work.  I sold a lot, all the way through hi
gh school.  I sold clothes, wome n™s shoes, every– 
so I decided I mi ght enjoy being a chemical salesm
an or technical represen
tative of that sort.  
And so, when I came out of Duke, I first went into
 the Service.  When I came out of t he Service I 
went to work for a chemical firm in 
Philadelphia, Rohm and Haas Comp any.   
 

Q: So you graduated in what year? 

 

A: 1953. 

 

Q: ™53, and then you enlisted? 

 

A: I was in the Air Force ROTC partly because 
at the time they gave you a break on tuition, it was 
sort of an avocation.  And I think becomi ng, 
I had originally, I had thought about, I mean I 
joined it–the early Air Force, the Navy ROTC™s
 were giving full scholarship.  The Air Force 
ROTC was just being established.  And I think th
ere was a commit ment to two years afterwards.  
It seemed like when you were footloose and fanc
y-free in peacetime, it mi ght not be such a bad 
thing to do to get, as a trade-off for some  tu
ition and again the idea of
 doing some  service for 
your country.  So at Duke, so that™s what I 
did.  And then the commit me nt, the two year 
commit me nt , I first thought I would like to fly.  A
nd I went to flight school for a short period of 
time and that didn™t really work out, so I ended 
up going to navigation training, which  I liked.  
And I became  a navigator and that had a three ye
ar commit ment attached to it, which I served 
out in England.   
 

Q: So was there any, that was 
during the Korean Wa r , right? 
 

A: Right.  It was during the Korean Wa
r , but I was very far from Korea. 

 

Q: So there was no– you knew that you weren™
t going to get involve
d in the war if you– 
 

A: Well, I don™t know that it would have ma ttered.  
There were some  of my, we had our choice if 
you were near the top of the class, where you 
wanted to go.  Maybe everybody had a choice.  
And I could have gone to, I don™t 
know that you went to Korea, to
 the Pacific or to teach.  I 
decided that the opportunity to go to England seem
ed like a really good one.  So I chose to go to 
England, because of Europe it just
 seemed like a nice opportunity to
 travel.  There were, I mean 
we lost, but it was not a military, you know, as I 
said, it was Cold– during the Cold War.  And

so we were doing a lot of exercises on
 the border out of Austria.  Bad Tölz
12
 is where the Special 
Forces were.  And we did a lot of very low flying to bring stuff in.  I would not have objected to 
being in, if we had had to go.  The big, I thi
nk most poignant thing for me was, while I was 
England, at one point towards th
e end of my tour, we were on 
alert for the Six Day War during 
the Suez Canal crisis.  And we were on alert 
for a week and nobody knew whose side we were 
on.  They didn™t know which side they were going to go on.  And I said, I think this is not a good 

way to spend your life, when you don™t know which 
side you™re on and then they tell you which 
side you™re on, whether you like it or
 not.  So, I thought– I enjoyed my days in the military, we 
had very– I mean I had wonderful associations.  
We , the group I was with on this small base in 
England still gets together every two or three 
years, and we™re going to 
be in Charleston in 
October.  Over those years my pacifist Quak
er wi fe has gotten to meet some of my war-
mongering friends and they™ve all gotten to know he
r.  And you know, most of them are retired.  
A lot of them spent their life in the military and 
then retired or had second careers.  But when 
you me ntioned Duke a while ago, I was thinking that 
it was very, in those da
ys Duke– if I had it 
to do over again, I probably would have gone to th
e University of North Carolina.  I had this 

scholarship.  It had a good academic reputation, as
 it is now.  It™s a much more liberal school 
now; it was very church-dominated.  But I made ve
ry good friends.  I was in a Jewish fraternity 
there during those years, which 
was probably the first group of st
rong associations with other 
Jewish me n that I had had since probably ever, 
because many of them came from other states, 
Florida and north, New York, New 
Jersey and what have you.  While I was there though, I was 
the delegate to the convention when we agreed to stop limiting the fr ater nity me mbership to 

Jews.  Still I think ma ybe predominantly, it was ca
lled ZBT.   I had a lot of mi xed feelings about 
that at the time , but– I mean it was also part of
 the history of– there was a Jewish sorority and 
a Jewish fraternity, and it sort 
of kept me , those were my strong associations when I was at 

Duke, other than the fact that I also wo
rked in the dining halls, doing waiting, doing 
dishwashing.  And then I became cashier and he ad
 waiter and learne d the food business at Duke.  
It was working your way through school.  But ther
e were, most of my very good friends at Duke 
were Jewish.  We  lived together fo
r the three or four years I was ther
e.  In terms of the continuity 
and where it was going.  And then I went into 
the Air Force and actually in London, in England 
we had some distant relatives, who were– I was ju
st looking at the fam
ily tree today, were– a 
guy name d David Tichauer who was related.  A cousin
 of my father™s wa s in London.   And then 
his daughter ma rried a rabbi and th
ey went to South Africa, and I 
think they™re back in England 
now.  But most of the people on the base were not Je
wish.  I mean most of my associations in the 
Air Force we ren™t.  So it™s sort of come  and gone .  I don™t know what we did on Jewish holidays.  

I think some one, there was a chaplain, he wasn™t
 Jewish.  I mean, it wasn™t  a full-time Jewish 
Chaplain there.  But I think I went to the– 
several times during the 
holidays I went to London, 
to be with the fa mily.  So it™s sort of come  
along.  I was looking at a picture in my mot her™s 
photograph that was taken at Chapel Hill when I we
nt back to Law School at the University of 
North Carolina.  And the group of Jewish student
s and the rabbi who was at Hillel,  which was 
the Jewish St udent organization on most campuses. 
 That was taken back then, so– it™s always 
sort of been there.  Wa nt to stop for a while?   
 

Q: Okay, it is now August 21st and we™re back ag
ain for more interviewing and Mr. Rosenberg™s 
going to say some  things that he learned 
last night from talking to his mother.

A: John.  Actually, this morning.  We  were not 
sure, I was not sure what had happened with my 
uncle when he was arrested.  And my mother do
es not know either whether he was arrested and 
taken away with my father, which I didn™t re
me mber, or whether– she thought that he was 
arrest ed at the same time or almost at the same
 time.  But may have been taken to a different 
place, because my– I told her my only recollec
tion was running the sandwich up the street to 
my father.  And I didn™t reme mber seeing my uncle 
at all.  But, I mean he ma y have been there 
and I was just focused on my father.  But th
ey did, he and my father did end up going to 
Buchenwald together.  And they were released 
together, because I remember, as I said, seeing 
them very bald, in Frankfurt am Main in my
 Aunt™s house, Elly™s house.  And my mother 
confirme d of course, that my grandmother took me th
en to El ly™s house.  She said that they ma de 
their way to Holland also.  She said my grandmothe
r then went to Rotterdam and lived in a small 
apartment by herself, near my aunt Mary.  That
 she said, she reme mbered the German, the Dutch 
governme nt would not allow immi gr ants to live with
 their relatives.  So she couldn™t live with 
her daughter, Mary, who had four children.  And sh
e took, apparently took her meals with her.  
My fa mily then went into this large detention ca
mp that I had explained, had talked about.  And 
she said my uncle also got there, eventually ended up in that same  place in Rotterdam.  She 

didn™t know how he got there, that he– because he
r impression was that he did not stay with my 
mother, my grandmother.  Whether he went back 
to Leer to close things down very quickly and 
then ma de his way to Rotterdam, whi c h is very 
possible.  I don™t know and I™m not sure that 
anyone recorded that.  But she did reme mber that 
he was in the detention 
camp with us part of 
the time  because she said that he, she reme mber
ed him comi ng up and talking with my father.  I 
just don™t reme mber, have good recollection of that
.  And he ma y not have been there the whole 
time we were there.  She said that he was on the boat that, after us, and the boat turned around, 

she reme mb ered because war broke out that very 
day, with the Dutch, and they told the ship to 
turn around.  Or with the British.  The war had st
arted and they wouldn™t let the boat continue.  
And you had asked about our contacts during the war.
  She knew, as far as she could recall there 
was no contact with anyone in 
the concentration camp.  She didn™
t reme mber when we learned 
that Sämmy had gotten married in the camp, but th
ere was no correspondence back and forth or 
any kind of– and no one had really any knowledge 
about what had gone on.  She said the Dutch 

governme nt– that both my grandmother and my
 uncle ended up at Theresienstadt.  They 
probably went to We sterbork first, where most of
 the refugees went to and then the Germans 
took all that over.  But that was 
pretty much, I just did not rememb
er, couldn™t fill that hole in.  
When I was in the Service, of course we had th
e relatives in England.  And I went to Germany a 
number of times with my Air Force, with our cr
ew, we flew planes into Germany se veral times 
and had some days off.  It was a very strange
 feeling to be in Germany, I always reme mber, 
having, knowing you™re in a country 
where the language is yours, it
™s not like the language you 
learned in college, but that people are speaking 
a language that you sort 
of know is your native 
language.  And yet we really were, our trips were 
generally, our stays were generally quite short.  
And I really never ma de much of an effort to 
sort of identify the local synagogue if there was 
one.  I mean I just didn™t come  into contact with 
ma ny Jews.  I was trying to
 think in retrospect, I 
suppose my first big jaunt was to go, my contact 
with the Jewish community was really when I 
went to Israel.  When I was in Germany, when I 
was in England, I took a trip to Israel where I 
visited my father™s sister and her family, and mycounterpart, who was my  ag
e at that time .  They 
were out in the country.  Living in a little
 place called Yokneam which wa s a cooperative 
far ming community.

Q: What were their name s? 
 

A: Their name s were de Vries.  His name was Ivan
 de Vries and her name  wa s Lina.  And that was 
when I me t Sä mmy™s wi dow for the first time .  She 
was living in an apar tment, I think in Haifa.  
And I spent some  ti me  with her, but we didn™t re
ally talk in detail a
bout the camps or I don™t 
know enough of her own relations.  
I think she ma y have had a sist
er or some one.  I don™t know 
about the details of her family.  And Moshe, 
my cousin, had already gotten ma rried to a young 
woma n na med Nurit.  In fact while we were th
ere, one of our other cousins was ma rried to– 
well, no, that was when I went on my  second trip.  This time I was in the military.  I was by 

myself.  And I stayed in Israel a couple of week
s.  We had some, I was going to say we had some 
other relatives in Tel Aviv, who had a– whose na
me  was Berliner, he was sort of an amateur 
archaeologist and he had collected this amazi
ng– had done a lot of digging and rooms  full of 
artifacts that he had collected.  But they were still,
 they still led a fairly pl ai n farm life back then, 
and were– I reme mber you didn™t leave any food 
on your plate.  And when they ate their 
chickens, they ate– or ducks, I th
ink, they ate every, they cleaned that duck out.  Head included.  
But they were lovely, lovely pe
ople and they knew, of course, Be
tty.  And then I just traveled 
around on my own.  And later when I came, after Jean and I we re ma rried, we came ba ck when 

she was pregnant with Michael.  
She said she was the fi rst non-Jewish wi fe in the family.  But 
while we were there we also we
nt to a distant cousin™s, rela
tive, wedding.  And that young ma n 
ma rried a Yeme nite Jewish woma n, which at that
 time was as different, as rare Jews ma rrying 
non-Jews in this country.  But th
at was several years later, and we
 were still– but it was nice.  
The family, we are, we still correspond with each 
other, and we still are close to our family in 
Israel with Moshe.  My father™s sister and her 
husband have died.  And Be
tty has also died.  So, 
but in terms of Ger many itself, you know, when I 
went, I think I me ntioned I had gone back to 
the town where my mother was born.   
 
Q: Did you have any me mo ries of 
that town?   Of Idar-Oberstein? 
 
A: I ma y have had some  va gue me mories about the 
butcher store, because I was so small when we 
were there, like five and six.  I reme mber the but
cher store sign.  It™s hard to tell whether what I 
reme mber really had more to do with recollections
 from pictures than from what was real.  The 

people I met, who reme mbered me obviously were co
ntemporaries of my mother or the sisters.  
It was a small country town and I think my grandf
ather was well-known in that area for his being 
a butcher, an honest butcher and hard working. 
 It™s like Prestonsburg, 
people who have lived 
here all of their livesŠI mean 
it was a very well known fa mily, the Schubach family.  So people 
when I first went there, word traveled pretty qui
ckly, at least in the area where they were and I 
me t a numb er of people who knew them.  I stayed 
in the local hotel.  And later when I came back 
with mother, a second time, you know, I me ntioned he
r friends were there.  But before that– but 

you always have this feeling generated by the notion 
that no one there that™s 
still alive, they™re all 
very embarrassed, ma ybe guilty about what happene
d.  And I guess most of them would say they 
didn™t know anything about it, just
 like the people who lived n
ear Dachau and Buchenwald and 
saw the smoke, and were looking the other way or
 knew,  probably most of them knew what was 
happening or ma ny people certai
nly knew what was happening in Germa ny.  Many were very 
sympathetic to the whole idea of Hitler and we
re very supportive of him all the way through, 
certainly when they thought they were going to wi n 
the war.  So, I™m sure I think that I had some 
of those mi xed feelings and wasn™t, I was younger th
en, that interested part
icularly in trying to

dig up a lot of Jewish history.  We ll for one 
thing Magdeburg was not in
– I couldn™t go to the 
city where I was born.  So other than the city– 
 
Q: Why couldn™t you go to Magdeburg? 

 

A: It was in the East zone.  It
 was in the Russian zone , so we couldn™t go.  We  couldn™t go until the 
Berlin Wa ll came down.  So I couldn™t go when I wa
s in the Se rvice or after that.  We – I did not 
go to Leer.  I don™t know why I did 
not really ever try to go to 
Leer.  My wife, Jean and her 
mother, when they drove down from Sweden on 
a European tour, went through there Leer once 
to see.  I have a film at home  that was ma de
 by a Jewish film maker about a reunion about the 
Jewish community from Leer, when Leer hoste
d the Jewish community for a reconciliation 
weekend and he happened to be ther
e and made a film of that.  He™s
 in Israel now, I think.  But I 
have that film and Leer™s a little bigger than it 
wa s.  Then I have a family history that you can 
have or a family tree and there™s a letter from a di
stant cousin in Virginia
, who sort of got into 
the genealogy and he went back to
 a number of these places wher
e my father™s mother, the rabbis 
and traced some  of that history back.  And went
 to Leer and all of those small towns where my 

grandmother came from and her fami ly came from
.  I guess I did not have anything that was 
really driving me  to do that.  
I think when you get to be olde
r, you sort of 
start thinking, 
some body– which is one my interests in talking w
ith you, it is important to preserve that history 
and it™s nice to have it and to know about it.  I™
m sure it has some  i mpac t  on all our lives, but I 
didn™t do very much of that when I was in the 
Service.  There was, I™m sure, still a lot of 
hostility, feelings, even though my
 mother and– my father and 
my mother did go back to 
Germany.  They went once or twice.  And my da d did not feel, I don™t think he was– I mean 

they went several summers in their re tireme nt to 
Austria.  And they had been to Vienna on their 
honeymoon.  So I don™t think their feelings were 
so strong.  And my moth
er, as I said, kept up 
her correspondence with some  of 
her friends.  So, anyway, that– 
 

Q: So what compelled you to go back was kind of, wa
s it just a kind of curiosity to see the place?  
Or did you have any– 
 

A: Well, the trips to Germa ny, the formal, were ge
nerally military.  We had an airplane.  We were 
flying into bases in Germany and ha d business ther
e of one sort or anothe
r, training mi ssions.  I 
didn™t really just go there to si
ghtsee.  I mean I was there for 
a reason and then generally we 
stayed over,  as we did in othe
r European places.  I had some  di
stant relatives in Pari s, which I 
went to see for fa mily connections, who are related to my mother, two older brothers.  But I 

think there is, you know, and ma ybe the local expl
orations were kind of 
curiosity, but it was 
more looking at this cathedral or– the towns that
 I wasn™t familiar wit
h, I didn™t– I went to 
Oberstein, I really went to Oberstein, to mothe
r™s home town because I 
happened to be there in 
survival training in that area a
nd didn™t realize how close it wa
s.  I think I was not yet on any– 
whether I would have gone there otherwise, I™m not 
sure.  I mi ght have.  I think I had some  idea.  
I knew mother was still in touch with her c
ontemporaries.  Even though my father had no 
connections to anybody in Magdeburg.  Most of thei
r friends that were alive had come  to this 
country.  So, there wasn™t much reason to go, ot
her than ma ybe trying to determine what the 
status was of the Jewish community.  Going to Is
rael of course was a voluntary, it was a vacation 
thing for me .  Going to Paris.  I think I 
didn™t go out of my wa y to go to Germany.

Q:  About going to Israel, did you ha
ve any, did you ever had any Zioni
st feelings or any desire to 
live there? 
 
A: Oh, I think it was a wonderful– it was wonderful 
to be there.  And I felt really proud of what 
had been done.  I never– my father was a very st
rong Zionist.  And I felt very strongly and still 
do about a Jewish homeland there.  But I didn™t
 really, I think with 
your parents, I never 
considered, I think, living 
far from where my parents lived, eith
er there– I me an sort of staying 
in Israel while they were here.  Just like in 
this country, I thought, I 
went to law school in 
Colorado one summer and went to other places. 
 And unless you have the me ans to get back and 
forth every weekend or some thi
ng, you™d want to be– I alwa ys t
hought we belonged in the east.  
To be near them.  So, Israel is certainly, Jean 
went  with me.  I™d like to
 go back again.  It™s a 
great accomplishment.  And it is, it™
s part of our history.  And it™s 
especially ni ce to have when 
you have relatives who are there, I mean they were 
part of the fa mily, bein
g that close, being my 
father™s sister.   
 

Q: Did you have a strong sense of  ___________  to the United St ates?

Tape 4, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number four, side 
A of an interview with John Rosenberg. 
 
A: I think I alwa ys had a very strong feeling about 
allegiance to America or pa
triotism.  I mean that 
goes back to my parents comi ng here.  You know, 
I think as you get olde
r, when events like 
Vietnam happens, you question it the way any other– 
the value of that action or any other action 
that the country takes as a nation, 
intervening in other wars or as 
a world leader and the limits to 
which you would want to go, that people go to in 
the name  of– that actions that we take as 
Americans against other countries, or whatever we  
do in our official nature.  As an American, I 
mean, as a responsible citizen should do, but I have
 certainly never gave 
it any thought.  I mean, 
I think as I said, when we were on alert for 
a week and didn™t know whose side we were on, I 
thought that™s not a way I want to 
spend my life.  I thi
nk if it were a little 
clearer than that I 
mi ght have stayed in the military just  because of 
the very cl ose associations I had with the people 
that I was in the Servi
ce with.  I mean we were just ve
ry, very good friends.  And when you do 
things toge ther and rely on each other in situa
tions I suppose that are some what dangerous, and 
you become  very close.  It doesn
™t have to be just on the bat
tlefield.  Even when you are doing 
training exercises that are, that
 involve some  danger, in which you act as a team.  And then you 
spend a lot of off time together or you™re on a ba
se, like a small base out in nowhere in England, 
you become  part of a family in some way.  And so 
there was, I would have considered that, I just 
was not– but I decided that I don™
t know that I™m ready to push the button on Israel for example 
and start– if we had come  in on the other side 
against Israel, I would ha
ve been in a terribl e 
predicament.  And wouldn™t want to
 fi nd myself in that pr edicamen
t.  And then after I married a 
Quaker, I left my tennis shoes at the Pe ntagon At
hletic Club and never went back to get them.  
You know, I probably have a much more, in some
 ways a different outlook about the value of 
violence and the value of military actions to so
me extent.  It™s certainly been moderated.  I 
wouldn™t at all call myself a pacifist.  But I don™
t know, anyway, that™s, I 
certainly think I would 
certainly consider myself a very, very much an American citizen. 
 

Q: And when you say you wouldn™t call yourself a p
acifist, what does that mean?   Does that me an 
that you– well we™ll just leave it 
at that.  What does that me an? 
 

A: Well, I think, you know, philosophically you obvious
ly, Quakers, if you take that position, take a 
strong pacifist position, you are 
in a sense ready to die when
 some one points a weapon at 
some one you love and is ready to pull a trigger. 
 And you™re not going to in
terfere with that sort 
of situation.  Or you feel that th
ere is never any justification fo
r violent action.  And I don™t think 
I™m in that pl ace.  I mean I think there pr
obably are situations wh
ere you ma y find yourself 
willing to react viol ently or to take up arms 
against some body else under certain situations, under 

those situations.  Like a war.  And you use a wa
r to end a war.  (Laughing.)  I think that™s 
probably still in my, I think it™s 
the last resort, and not one th
at I would promote, but I don™t 
think I could easily stand by, and st
and there.  Of course, I joined
 the, I wa s in the Air Force 
voluntarily, no one drafted me . 
 

Q: Were you aware of criticisms of Je ws during th
e Holocaust, that they had not resisted enough?   
And that they had been too pacifistic and just 
passive in allowi ng the violence to happen to them, 
that they had–?

A: You mean in the concentration camps or where or  when? 

 

Q: In general in the whole– there were some criticisms that were voiced, especially just 
imme diately following the war by Bruno Bettelheim a
nd others that the Jews had gone like sheep 
to the slaughter.  And that they had not resisted
 enough.  That this was a problem with the Jewish 
people, that they were not ready enough to 
take up arms to defend thems e lves.  And I™m 
wondering if you, if you shared that
 point of view or if you were
 aware that people thought that, 
or if you have any thoughts about that? 
 

A: I don™t, I am not familiar with that.  And 
I mean I think it™s pr obably– I don™t see how anybody 
could take  that position because th
e Germans were so, they were armed.  They were so superior .  
There were those courageous, there were some  
of those acts, you know, in
 several concentration 
camps wher e the Jews broke out or had plotted to
 leave and some  did escape.  I don™t know the 
name  of those camps.  And there were individual 
acts of resistance.  I 
don™t think, I don™t see 
how anybody could have said that.  I mean I™ve re
ad an awful lot about and heard a lot about 
Jews who were ma de to sort of cooperate a
nd throw the bodies away, 
orhow much were you 
willing to do to stay alive?   Because the camps also, the camps themselves were operated in a 

large part by slave labor, which wa
s pretty horrible, and some  of 
the work that people had to do 
was pretty horrible.  And they were doing it partly
 to stay alive or they could have gotten shot 
under the circumstances.  And I™m sure people right 
down to the last second feel like, as some  
would say, I was trying to stay alive and hope
 everybody would, that people understand it.  
Whether you are the person who™s going down the 
list and saying this, and have some decision 
ma king about who™s going to die and who™s going to 
live, or whether you™re out there and, where 
you™re effectively ma king those decisions, hoping to
 keep yourself off the list.  Or whether 
you™re actually throwing bodies 
in a pit or doing some  other 
kind of ma intenance work, you™re 
under the gun.  I don™t think you can
 ever, I don™t see how any, I 
mean I do see, but I would 
never want to be critical of a
nybody who is doing that when they™re essentially forced to do it.  
The people who would say go ahead and shoot me, 
and let some body shoot them, are heroes of a 
different sort, I suppose.  And he
roines of different sorts, when you do those sorts of things on 
principle.  And that™s how, I guess, principles 
are established over time.  But it™s expecting a lot 
from someone.  And I think there is an element of
 forgiveness, generally in our tradition and in 
other traditions.  You may have to
 take an extreme measure to sa
ve yourself.  You can™t expect 
people to lay down.  So I don™t think that anyone 
could accuse the Jews of being– if that me ans 
going like lambs to the slaughter.  I mean they di dn
™t have, most of those, most fa milies weren™t 
arme d.  My father never allowed us to have
 any weapon.  He almost bought me  a BB gun once 
and then some body had gotten a window shot out
 in the neighborhood and I never got my BB 
gun.  But we never had a gun in the house.  And he
 wouldn™t let us have weapons.  That was one 
of the no-no™s, one of the few no-no™s. 
 

Q: Were you aware of, by the time that you were in
 the Air Force, were 
you very interested in 
American politics, political issu
es?  I™ll leave it at that.  I 
have another re
lated question. 
 

A: I think that™s hard to answer.  I don™t know, b
ecause when I was, I think I was, you know, pretty 
young.  And you come  out of high school and you
™re out of a background where I had, was 
really fortunate.  I was pr esident of the senior 
class and had been working and went to Duke and

45
it seemed like a good thing to do.  And my fatherŠwe went to the bank, I reme mber borrowing 
two or three hundred dollarsŠhe sent
 me  twenty-five bucks a month. 
 And they were straining to 
get me , and I was working to get through.  I don™t 
think the politics of what was going on was, I 
think my, ideally we were so grateful to be here
 that generally everything seemed like it was very 
positive to be in this country.  I was the fi rst person of my generation to go to college.  My 

parents were very proud of that.  So, I suspec
t in ma ny ways– Israel, this country was very 
supportive of Israel.  So, I just th
ink probably in our eyes, it might 
be a stretch to say the country 
could do no wrong, but pretty close to
 it.  And that we were ready 
pretty much to accept the way 

things were going and felt pretty good about it.  I 
mean I think we felt, I™m sure my parents felt, 
my dad, that we had come a long way.  He was 
working hard, his son was going to college, his 
younger brother was doing well in school.  I don™t thi
nk the politics– my father read the paper 
religiously.  He was a very educ
ated person and he had very st
rong views of his own about, he 
was very mu ch of an anti-Communist.  He 
did not, he  always pr
eached that Communism 
wouldn™t work, that you couldn™t exp
ect it to and that he thought 
it was a very repressive system, 
not only for religion, but for huma
n beings, he thought Communis m was  terrible.  And, I me an  
he didn™t get out on the street corners, but– he wasn™t hims elf involved in any politics at home.  

He voted, he had very strong views, but as I say, 
he was very much of a private person.  And I 
think the way in ma ny s mall, southern towns, po
litics isn™t top of the ag
enda norma lly.  I me an 
you lead a pretty insulated, very provincial sortof life.  Unless you are– 
especially if you are in 
a working-class family.  So I don™t think I was ve
ry politically astute.  I mean, and a s I say, I 
didn™t have the first thought about any problem about joining th
e ROTC.  I guess I mi ght have 
thought it was a good thing to do, as 
far as trying to serve the count
ry, you™d get tuition, be able 
to contribute a little bit. 
 

Q: Did you have, so you joined the Air Force in 1954? 

 
A: Let™s see, I graduated from Duke in ‚53, so I 
was in the ROTC the last two years, I think.  ‚51, 
1950-51. There were several of my fr aternity brothers
 who were in as well.  It was also a way to 
be an officer and not to be drafted, not to be an
 enlisted person.  But, and we had a summer ca mp 
in Tyndall Ai r Force Base in 1950, I guess,
 or ‚51.  So we graduated in ‚53. 
 
Q: The reason I™m asking is I™m interested in
 your awareness of the Civil Rights move ment 
developments and whether you were aware of or pa
rticularly interested 
in what went on with 
Brown versus the Board of Education. 
 

A: Well, it was 1954, which is when I– 1954, I wa
s in navigation school in Texas and I think 
clearly I must have known about it.  I mean 
it was a big event in 1954.  But you know, it wasn™t 
anything that touched me  overnight.  And I th
ink Houston, Texas was 
still pretty much a 
segregated town.  I think over the years that I wa
s in the Air Force, from ™54 to ™57, and I told 
you about the incident with Abe Jenkins.  That wa
s really early, actually 
when you think about it.  
That incident on the train was 1956.  And I 
think the Interstate
 Commerce Commission 
eliminated that practice, and stopped the segregati
on in the train, at least 
by direction, some ti me  
in the next  two or three years.  And things were 
just starting really to bubble.  Because  I joined 
the Civil Rights Division in 1962.  The Montgome
ry Freedom Rides, the bus, those things had 
just taken, they were in 1960, I think, and ‚61, ma
ybe even the beginning 
of ‚59.  But when I 
went, let™s see, I went to law 
school and my law school years were
 ‚59 to ‚62.  I came out of the

service in ‚57, then I went to work for the 
Rohm and Haas Company in Philadelphia as a 
technical representative for a year and a half
.  And I traveled Pennsylvania, New York and 
Northeastern states, selling, basically selling 
chemicals, but doing technical sales work, which 
involves developing, having some  
knowledge of chemistry, devel
oping some  product, I called on 
some  phar maceutical companies.  Which among othe
rs, water softening, the chemicals in water 
softener.  Rohm and Ha as ma nufactured some thing called Amberlite
 resins, which when 
they™re in very mi croscopic size, 
filter water and ma ke hard wate
r soft.  And you pour water, salt 
water in to get the hard water, get the calci um of
f.  And those same  resins ma ke a film and when 
you, when you put them in water and let the water 
dry up you™ve got clear floor polishes.  And if 
you let the chemical polymers get thicker you get 
all the way, you all of a sudden you have plexi-
glass.  But I worked at the Rohm and Haas
 during 1958 and took the law school test.  So I 
entered law school in 1959.  And we  had, one 
of my classmates is now, who™s now the 
Chancellor of North Carolina Central, was an
 African-Ame rican name d Julius Chambers, who 
became a very prominent civil rights lawyer. 
 Really brilliant  young ma n, who became , was 
actually first in our class.  He wa
s the editor-in- chief of the Law Review
13
.  And we were good 
friends, and so the years we were
 in law school, I think those ‚59 to ‚62, were the first– I think 
we had three or four African-Ame ricans in our class.
  It ha d all– the fi rst in North Carolina, that  
barrier had been broken to some  extent.  
But it wa s going on, and the Freedom Rides were 
happening and I think we  were all conscious of
 what was going on.  And Julius was just an 
exemplary young ma n, and did a wonderful, was a great 
model.  Worked terribly hard.  We  were, 
there were a few of us who were good friends, who 
were friends with him.  There was still– I 
don™t know that it was open hostility, because he
 was such a quiet guy, and who was always first 
in his class, so there wasn™t,  
I don™t think there was a lot of hos
tility di rect ed towards him, as 
such, except the racial.   I mean, people, st
udent body from, law school students are pretty 
conservative anyway, but the students from eas
tern North Carolina, who were from t he 
segregated, the Black Belt of North Carolina, 
were certainly still not
, I think, as a group, 
sympathetic to having the law school
 desegregated.  We  never had 
any particularly violent, any 
incidents while I was there.  But anyway, I thi
nk that period, it wasn™t
 so much when I was 
selling chemicals, I mean I was, really had, I th
ink I was just– law school mi ght have been in 
the back of my mi nd, but in the 
Northeast, things were not as 
clear.  And I was focused on my 
work and being single and living in Philadelphi
a and having a good time when I wasn™t working.  
And it was not a ma jor kind of issue for me .  It was nothing I spent my ti me on before I went to 

law school.  And I think law school
 ma de you a ware of that, especi
ally in the context of my 
experience in the military, that the South– th
at we had to do– you know, that things would 
have to change in the South.  They ought to change in the South, because if you were from 

places like Gastonia, where I gr ew up or you 
liked your home town, and you liked being a 
Southerner and you saw the good things that the South 
had to offer, that this racial situation had 
to change.  It mi ght have to be forced to ma ke 
those changes.  But I think I began to think about 
trying to do some thing, use, having the law, using 
the law to help do that.  I don™t know that it 

was all very clear when I first st
arted in law school.  Because I r
eally wasn™t sure– I decided to 
go to law school only– it probably, that ma y have 
been in the back of my mi nd, but I think once 
I had been se lling chemicals for a year, it just
 wasn™t terribly fulf
illing.  Or  if you™re a good 
salesperson if you like to sell and 
you like people and can
 sell anytime.  You can always sell one

product or another.  I still had 
the G.I. Bill available and just 
decided that I thought that there 
mi ght be a good opportunity to use my head before 
I let my brain shrink.  
And so it was all those 
sort of things together.  I think that Julius 
and the– I think that 
being in law school and 
reme mbering my experiences in the Service probably
 had a lot to do, it just sort of came together 
as a way of having me  ultimately decide that– I 
mean when I first went to law school I didn™t 
even know if I could get through law sc
hool because it was such a big change. 
 
Q: Why did you choose law school in particular? 

 

A: I think I wanted to, well, I wanted to use my he
a d in a– more of an intellectual capacity.  And I 
thought that, and I liked– I don™t know if I took a bunc
h of interest tests.  I wasn™t so sure.  I 
was doing fine in this sales work.  And I was a
bout to be moved to New York City to take up 
where, a big area, Long Island, New York, where 
another representative 
wa s getting ready to 
retire.  You know, I wish I could say, well I want
ed to go to law school so I could help, so I 
could go to work for the Civil Rights Division of 
the Department of Justice.  But I don™t think 
that was quite the way it was.  I think I want
ed to go to law school because it seemed like a good 
way to– it would be a good skill to 
have.  It would be a challenge to become  a lawyer.  I think I 
knew enough to know, I knew enough that the legal sy
stem was a logical way of thinking.  A lot 
of people who are ma thematicians or who have sc
ientific backgrounds seem 
to like that.  I had  
some  interest in– I say at one
 point I thought about even bei
ng a rabbi.  And in terms of 
interests it just seemed to fit 
with my general outlook on a good wa
y to use the G.I. Bill and to 
go back to North Carolina and go to school.  It
 does sound kind of– I was ma king, I think when 
I first went to, it was a period of time when a lot 
of veterans were back in school.  And there was 
in fact sitting, this ni
ce educational package to do some th
ing with, for a few years if you had 
some thing in your mi nd.  If you could afford it.
  If you could use it. 
 It wouldn™t pay for 
everything, but– So it seemed to me , I was singl
e.  It was kind of like– I don™t know why my 
sister decided to go to law school after twenty year
s as an architect.  I mean it was just, I think it 
was something like that.  It mi ght be nice to chan
ge, do some thing different.  I could always sell 
chemicals.  I don™t think it had anyt hing necessarily
 to do with my Jewishness or the Holocaust.  
It just was, I think I decided, I mean sales peop
le spend their time  going fr om, if you™re traveling, 
whether it™s chemicals or some thing else, going fro
m one large corporation to
 another, sitting in 
somebody™s waiting room until they™re ready to
 see you, havi ng, ma ybe going, having a big 
lunch, but having an hour or two discuss talk
ing about your product and 
their product and how 
they mi ght use it and why they aren™t buying as much as they ought to or whether, all the things 

about your pr oduct that are better than the compe
tition™s.  And then you go on to someplace else.  
And you mi ght stay in nice hotels an
d eat nice big, eat lots of steaks,
 looking back on it.  But it 
isn™t particularly challenging and it™s not
, and you also do not become , you don™t have a 
community.  I think that was one of the things 
that bothered me too, in Philadelphia when I was 
thinking back about it.  I reme mber it bothered me  
back then to some  extent, although I wasn™t as 
conscious of that as I am now.  And that is 
that the people who I worked with, the executives, 

worked in Philadelphia, but they all lived in s
uburbia and suburban communities.  And so they 
were not at all concerned about th
e inner city of Philadelphia.  
It was not their community.  And 
so I, which I think, in ma ny of our urban areas gave really rise to th
e decay, to having those 
communities go downhill, until you found 
some  rebirth in those communities.  And that™s what™s 
nice, of course, about small towns, which is what 
I prefer anyway.  But, and so I think I was not 
particularly happy with that way of life, living do
wn, in my sales job.  I think I was looking for 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007

48
some thing else to do and hadn™t really– I had not, 
there didn™t seem to be anything I had a real 
burning desire to do.  And going back to school 
seemed like something I wanted to do, but I 
wasn™t sure, probably.  I didn™t want
 to get a Master™s in chemistr
y.  I didn™t think I wanted to 
spend my life– I spent three months in a resear
ch lab.  That particular organization that I 
worked for was a, you know, they were an excellent company.  They were very– and before 
you even became a sales representative, you were
 in the labs for three months, working on 
products with their own laboratory people.  So, you got
 a sense of what that life is like and what 
they can do and the sort of support they can give
, and so if you™re throwing out theories about 
what mi ght be possible with your product, some
body there could, would be available and that 

sort of thing.  I think all of that just sort of
 move d, it just seemed like a good decision.  And after 
all, since when I went to, if it didn™t work out af
ter a year or it didn™t wo
rk out, I could always do 
some thing else.  I didn™t have a family attached
 to me .  But I know, I™m
 sure, I think that I 
reme mber the first couple of months here in la
w school I wondered what am I doing here.  I was 
not making any money a nymore.  (Laughing.)  And just
 to have the G.I. Bill 
and a little sa vings.  
Actually I was in the Air Force Reserve.  I wasin the Air Force Reserve when I was working for 

Rohm and Haas in Delaware.  I went down there on weekends once a mo nth.  And I suppose 

that™s a comme nt on– I think, I™m trying to reme mb
er whether, I think I 
had essentially me t my 
obligation.  There was a little mone
y there, but I was interested in
 ma intaining that proficiency.  
And was not sort of, you know, kissing the military good bye.  And I belonged to an Air Force 

Reserve organization in Delaware. 
 And kept on flying for a year or two.  And then when I came 

back to law school, when I came to law school, I c
ontinued.  And in part it
 was an income .  At 
that point it was really partly income  and 
I was a dormitory daddy when I was in law school, 
keeping, had all of– related to a lot of  the Ke
ntucky stuff.  But I was the dormitory daddy I call 
it, for all the football players at the University 
of North Carolina.  There are a lot of them and 
they had a dorm full of players.  And some  of 
them were veterans as well, who were going back 
to school.  At  least two of those years.  So, I think all of that sort of combi ned to see how it 
would to go.  And then I –

Tape 4, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape number four, side B. 

 

A: But the– in law school, when you start your very
 first class, it often as
sume s you™ve already had 
several, all the other classes.  
All of law is basically so interr
elated and the principles that you 
apply in one course often come – are related to so
me thing in another course.  So in a sense it 
doesn™t all come  together till you
™re finished.  And then you– I to
ld my sister when she started 
studying for the Bar, as much as I did not like 
taking the Bar and studying for the Bar, the Bar 
Review for the first time sort of brings all that 
stuff together.  They don™t 
have a comp rehensive.  
I mean I don™t know why, law school easily could ha
ve a comp rehensive exam like Ph.D. exa ms, 
and then you™re a lawyer.  Been 
a lot of debate about that, but it 
never has come  about.  So, I™m 
sure I, like ma ny other students, felt pretty lost
 the first couple of months .  And say why did I 
leave a nice good paying job in Ph
iladelphia and come  back down here and go to law school?   
But I stuck it out and I actually 
got to, as I think other law student
s do, towards, I got to, I got to, 
enjoy ma y be the wrong word.  But by my last 
year when we were doing semi nars and more 

research and writing stuff, I enjoye
d my being there.  And started 
to see, I think, how I, that I 
could, that it would be very challenging to be 
involved in the Civil 
Rights struggle through the 
legal, using the law.  I wa sn™t so sure yet.  I st
ill interviewed so me fi rms in Atlanta.  It was out 
here, and you see the United States
 doing these things.  There were firms in the South that were 
doing some civil rights 
litigation.  And actually 
when I interviewed with the Honors program for 
the Department of Justice, I don™t know how this
– as I said, I first went to the Anti-Trust 
Division, and I can™t, don™t know that I chose th
e Anti-Trust Division or 
chose the Civil Rights 
Division.  When I got to Wa shington and they pu
t me  in the Anti-Trust Division I asked to go to 
the Civil Rights Division.  And tried to get an 
interview with– I think the Civil Rights Divisi on 
was almost impossible to get in
to, because there were only– th
ey only had about eight lawyers 
that were doing civil rights wor
k.  And one of them was John Doar
14
, and he was Assistant 
Attorney General and you coul
dn™t get a job there unless he 
saw you and he decided he was 
going to hire you.  And he was in the South most of
 the time.  And it was very hard to get in the 
door.  And it was not a really favored section 
in the Department.  It was so small because 
Congress didn™t appropriate 
a lot of money yet.  I mean Senator Eastland
15
 and the  Congress 
was not yet really committed to
 putting the full force of the 
governme nt behind civil rights 
litigation.  So, that™s how it just
 sort of ca me  together.  A
nd you know, it was logical in some  
ways and it ma de a lot of sense to me.  I just
 don™t think I realized 
as I was going through law 
school, I mean as I say, I went to Atlanta and in
terviewed with a couple of fir ms, with some  
firms, one of which did a lot of civil rights wor
k.  And it was a small firm, and then I came back 
and I interviewed with the Departme nt of Justice.
  And then my roomma te and I, one of the, a 
fellow from North Carolina who I had gone throu
gh law school with, he had interviewe d with 
the Federal Trade Commission and we ended up 
going to Washington together and renting an 
apartment.  He was still a bachelor.  And that™s 
how I got my job, initially
.  I was with the Anti-
Trust Division probably, ma ybe a month or two a
nd then I we nt to work for the Civil Rights 
Division.  And I was very, very pleased to be able to go there.

Q: And at what point did you realize 
that you wanted to do civil rights work? 
 
A: Well, I think really– I don™
t know that in 1959 when I graduated, I mean 1962.  That was, Ole 
Miss was going on.  And I think Julius Cha mbers we
nt to Charlotte, I think we had some  very 
serious discussions about civil rights work.  And 
it was in the papers.  And I think I really did, 
while I was on the campus of UNC.  I mean, by 
that time it was the foremost issue in the 
country.  It was school desegr
egation, Brown.  People were s
till not complying with Br own
16
.  It 
was the Ross Barnett
17
, Ole Miss.  It wa s the summer 
of Meredith tryi ng to get in
18
.  So, and 
North Carolina wasn™t on the forefront of desegreg
ation efforts either.  I 
don™t think any of the 
states were.  So I think by the time  that I got 
to Washington, I thought that 
I would really want to 
be in the Division if I could get 
there.  I think in my mi nd I was going to come  back to the South 
to practice law.   Or that I would come  home 
at some  point to North Carolina where my fa mily 
was living.  And that I felt that what the government
 was doing was right.  A
nd that it would be a 
great opportunity to be a part of that as a Sout
herner.  I guess you kind of feel like you™re helping 
to improve the place that you live in from a 
position where you could do some  good.  I think I 

was pretty convinced that this was not going to
 happen entirely voluntarily.  And that it would 

take that kind of activity to do it.  Even though 
those were very, very small steps.  The Division 
was very small and was really– there was Mere
dith.  Most of the work the Division wa s 
involved in involved voting rights 
at the time.  There were very few Federal areas where the 
governme nt had the authority to 
intervene, besides voting.  Ther
e was no legislation yet until 
1964 where anything could be done about public 
accommoda tions or employment. Housing.  All 
of those were yet to come.  So John Doar had 
accepted hi s position at th
e end of the Eisenhower 
Admi nistration.  I think he had 
only been there a couple of year
s.  He was a lawyer from 
Wi sconsin, a plaintiff™s lawyer, who was willing 
to undertake this job.  And then when the 
Kennedys came in he was in the South, in Loui
siana working.  Nor mally they mi ght have 
appointed– Doar was a Republican.  And I think 
Bobby Kennedy read one of his affidavits he 
had filed or was looking at one of
 the cases that he was involved in and was so impressed, he 
interviewed him and asked him if he would stay
 on as First Assistant, when Burke Marshall 
became the Assistant Attorney General
19
.  And he said he would, so he was the boss, that I 
interviewed with.  And I think he was also some wh
at attracted to the fact that I was from the 
South.  I was also a little older and wa s a veteran and had done well, so he took a chance.   
 

Q: Was it hard to get an interview with him?  

 

A: Yeah, it was.   

 

Q:  How did you ma nage it? 

 

A:  I mean you just had to bang on his, you had tokeep comi ng down.  But he was traveling so much 
and I don™t know whether it was part of his system. 
 I mean it was a very small, and some  people

would say a little bit of an elite 
group of people.  There were se
veral people who had worked in 
the Division for a long time , who 
ha d been in the Departme nt of 
Justice and the civil rights area, 
the governme nt had not been very active.  We  also
 had authority in police 
brutality cases already, 
but I think generally it was not an area, it wa
s an area where the United States attorneys who 
were in the various states pretty
 well controlled.  It was seen as
 some thing that the governme nt 
was not doing much about.  Mistreatme nt of blac
ks in the South by police officers.  The U.S. 
attorneys were in charge of that
, and ma ny of them were from those areas and they we re just not 
going to do very much about it.  I mean the discri
mi nation and segregation wa
s very blatant.  In 
ma ny of the southern counties, there wa
s– I me an Governor Barnett and Wa llace
20
 just defied 
the governme nt, said we™re not goi
ng to let blacks in thes
e universities, right.  And that was the 
way the voting thing was all over the South at the 
time.  You c ould not, blacks couldn™t vote.  If 
they went up to try and register
 they™d lose their jobs or thei
r lives.  So, it was very, and there 
were very few resources that 
were being devoted to doing anyt
hing about it, until the Ke nnedy 
Admi nistration.  And I suppose the Pr esident was s
till, in retrospect, wa
s some what criticized.  
But when Bobby Kennedy came in, I mean there were only, this was a very small, still a very 
small division.  And it started growing, very sm
all, in small numbers budgetarily.  But John 
Doar™s idea and I think Burke Mars
hall™s was to do one step at a ti
me .  And we were in Southern 
courtrooms with Southern judges and even Fede
ral judges were oftentimes from a ba ckground, 
from segregated communities and we re not willing 
to step out and enforce the law.  So, when we 
first started we lost ma ny of those cases, unt
il they were appeale
d– our job was to– and 
generally the FBI in ma ny of those communities wa
s not sympathetic.  The FBI wanted to, they 
wanted to go out and solve bank robberies.  What we wanted them to do was to come  with us to 

a courthouse and stand there a
ll day with a mi crofilm machin
e and photograph voting records, 
which we would then take back to Washington,
 and we would spend days and nights analyzing 
those records.  We  would, because the FBI was al
so, most of those people from that area, they 
weren™t very good about interviewing in the bl
ack community.  Probably were not sympathetic 
to having those people register 
to vote.  So, we, John developed the notionŠwhich sounds very 
sensible, but had not happenedŠof basically go
ing into these commun
ities and identifying the 
black leaders eith
er through the NAACP
21
 or they™d go in a funeral home or they™d ma ke a 
complaint, or one or two people that, do you know 
this person, and who else, and we would meet 

with those people and find out that yes, Arwen Donahue tried to register to vote ten years ago or 

some body went up to the courthouse a
nd did try to register to vote 
a couple of years back.  Her 
name  or his name , and e very once in a while you™d
 find out that they mi ght have let one or two 
people register.  The guy who owned the loca
l funeral home or some body who was well-known 
in the community, that the white business commun
ity was aware of and that the registrar was 
aware of.  But they would either not let them vote or
 register at all, becaus
e they would lose their 
jobs.  This job that John Doar, this case John 
was working on, that Kennedy had read, involved a 
fe llow name d Atlas
22
 in Louisiana, who was a farmer, who ra
ised cotton himself.  He had a small 
far m.  He went up to register 
to vote and they found out, and th
ey wouldn™t let him.  But beyond 
that the local ginners then refused to gin his co
tton.  He went to a number of places, they simply, 
they refused, they just would not 
gin his cotton.  So, he went to Fe
deral court to tr
y to order them 
to gin his– to stop interfering wi
th his right to vote.  And that
 was how that began.  But then 
John, I think, was up in Haywood and some  of 
the Tennessee counties, and wherever people

started writing fr om, we would get some compla
ints.  And so we would go to the communities 
and fi nd out who tried to regist er 
and get those names.  And especially if they were able to fill 
out a form.  And what these Southern counties,
 what was going on was they were admi nistering 
a literacy test .  And basically using a literacy 
test  to deny black applicants.  Teachers, pe ople 
who wrote very articulate constitutional sections
 and they would give 
blacks very difficult 
sections to interpret, which you and I mi ght not be ab
le to interpret at all.  Or if they gave them 
an easier section they would turn
 them down.  And at the same  ti
me  they were registering whites 
who were illiterate, essentially illiterate, 
and who wrote,  and/or who wrote very 

incomprehensible answers that didn™t ma ke a
ny sense.  It didn™t ma tter what they wrote 
basically.  And so I™ve got notebooks.  And we 
would then go back, find the records of those 
persons, and go to court and ask th
e black registrant applicant to
 testify, and they would prove, 
could prove their literacy.  ﬁYes, I™m a teacher, I™v
e been a teacher for ten or fifteen ye ars.  I 
have a Master™s from Tougaloo College.ﬂ  And 
then we would have also found the registration 
for ms of those whites who either looked as though they couldn™t write or ma ybe even in some  

cases there were even x™s.  A
nd ask that person, and would have 
the FBI go out and see the white 
persons and ask to show them their form and ask 
them to read, when they couldn™t.  And so we 
would subpoena them to court, and they would show
 that they couldn™t read or that they were 
just given help.  They could testify, ﬁYes I came 
up and I registered.  I wrote my na me.ﬂ  ﬁWhat 
about a constitutional section?ﬂ  ﬁW
ell, he told me to copy this 
and write it down.ﬂ  That kind of 
thing.  And so we gradually were able to get the 
courts to adopt a theory
 that if you, that they 
have to register blacks on the same  basis they 
registered the least qualif
ied white person.  I don™t 
know that in those early cases, it wasn™t to regist
er illiterates, because th
e courts di dn™t want to 
regist er people who were just illiterat e.  But 
if you could write, if th
ey were accepting some one 
who could only write their name  or who could unde
rstand a very basic sentence, that that would 
be applied across the board.  But that took seve
ral years, because the courts were unwilling.  
They would find some  excuses.  Or they would sa
y ﬁWe™ll register the five, we™ve got to register 
those five people who testified.  I believe that™s 
true of them, but you don™t have any others here.  
Who else do you have? ﬂ   We ll, we might not– th
ere weren™ t any others because they were 
afraid to go, even though there mi ght have been 
more blacks living in the county than whites.  
But all the whites were registered and very few bl
acks.  And that goes back to reconstruction and 

the development of the literacy test and the poll test, tax.  So, we spent our fi rst, I spent the fi rst 

few years in those kinds of cases.  And as we got
 more lawyers, and as we  did those cases, the 
Greenwood– that was also the pe
riod of time when there was more, there was more action by 
SNCC and CORE.  And you know, in 1964 you had the 
killing of the three 
civil rights workers 
around that very thing.  They were holdi
ng voting rights meetings in Neshoba County, 
Mississippi. 
 

Q: How did that work?   If there 
were eight civil rights lawyers in
 the Departme nt and then you had 
John Doar, who was going down into the center of 
things and networking with the leaders?  
Would you go along with Doar on selected cases a
nd other lawyers on other 
cases?   Or how did 
it actually, what did you do? 
 

A: Well, we basically, we were essent ially spli
t up geographically.  We  ha
d a Mississippi section 
and an Alabama section and a Louisiana section.  
And I think when I came  there were like four 
lawyers in each of those states, 
it mi ght have been a few more.  I shared an office with a fellow

named Gerald Stern
23
, who was from Memphis and I think th
ere were actually– for a while, and 
then there we re three or four of us and Gerry ev
entually went to a large law fir m.  Anyway, he, 
we would be, we four would basically be assi
gned two or three counties and we would go down 

ourselves.  It was John, it was, the first few 
cases he tried by, he was the lawyer in the 
courtroom, and supervised the preparation of th
e cases, and did much of the courtroom work.  
And as time went on, it was a real learning time, 
we did all of the spade work.  And we had a 
team of us, t here were, John would have one lawy
er inside the courtroom with him and one or 
two of us would be outside.  And we would do the 
interviews of the witne
sses.  And we did all 
this document preparation, I mean there would be 
several, even had a footlocker full of voting 
rights records.  Very muc h like do
ing an anti-trust case.  I mean 
it was all of their records and our 
witnesses together proved this case of discri
mi nation.  But like, I was assigned to Green– to 

LeFlore County, Mississippi.  So, I spent a great
 deal, I mean John couldn™t learn everybody, all 
over the South.  I spent a lot of time in Greenw
ood, Mississippi.  Met all 
of the leaders in the 
community.  And there were a lo
t of voting ma rches in 1963.  And 
they arrested a lot of, there 
were a lot of arrests.  And I we
nt into the jail and interviewed 
a lot of the people who had been 
arrested.  And then we filed a suit to get them 
out of jail.  There were a lot of discussions 
between the lawyers for LeFlore and Greenwood a
nd me  and some –  John would call in, but at 
one point– and then the longer we
 were there the more responsibility we had.  Then as time  
went on the number of lawyers we
nt from eight to sixteen to th
irty.  And obviously he couldn™t 
take all the cases, so at that point I started, we were the lead trial lawyers ourselves.  But I, and at 

one point I had four of those cases going at
 once in Greenwood, Mississippi.  A case involving, 
there were voting rights cases.  And then in
 1964, that summe r  they, when the Public 
Accommoda tions Act came  in, there were two 
theaters in Greenwood, the Paramount and the 
LeFlore.  The LeFlore wa s part of a chain 
out of Louisiana.  Th
ere was a fellow name d 
Marchand, who was the ma nager.  And the chain d
ecided they would comply
 with the civil rights 
laws and they were going to let blacks go to the 
movies, because they had always been upstairs.  
And the Paramount said no, they weren™t going to 
let them in, they were going to challenge the 
law.  So, when the LeFlore said they would then
 some  blacks went into 
the movie.  They were 
beaten and were ejected essentia
lly.  And the police stood by.  And 
so we filed a case in Federal 
court to require the police to start gi vi ng them pr
otection and to stop this interfering and to sort 
of guarantee the safety of the 
blacks who would go to the movies. 
 And then also at the same  
time we filed a case to stop the Pa
ramount from refusing to admit bl
acks.  Then we had, let™s see, 
then there wa s another case.  Greenwood is wh
ere Byron de la Beckwith, he™s the one who 
killed, shot Medgar Evers
24
.  The lawyer who was in one of 
these cases represented Beckwith.  
There was an earlier case involvi
ng a voting rights ma rch, I spen
t a lot of time– there was a 
little community outsi de of Green
wood name d, c a lled Itta Bena, Miss
issippi.  It is a very small 
far ming community that™s all the 
Delta, cotton country.  And the bl
ack section of that town was 
called Balance Due, sort of the 
story of their lives, right?  A
nd they had a voting rights, they 
were all at a meeting in a church one night.  They
 were at a rally, a voti
ng rights rally.  And there 
was singing, and people were–in 1964.  And some
one threw a s moke bomb into the church.

Q:  Was this where Vernon Dahmer
25
 was fro m?  
 
A: No, Dahmer  was from Meridian, Hattiesburg, Missi
ssippi.  We  were involve
d in that case.  Jean 
worked on that case.  In fact I have a painti
ng, if you come  by the house we got off of, we bought 
at a restaurant in Meridian.  But we worked, 
I worked on Dahmer some .  I would work on the 
three civil rights workers case for 
quite a time.  Anyway this voti
ng rights thing.  They arrested, 
so they decided to ma rch up to the deputy sheri
ff™s house to complain about this interference.  
And there were about sixty or seventy of these fo
lks.  And it was night time.  And the next thing 
you know, they arrested them all, and took them all 
to jail, from like fifteen 
year olds to seventy 
year olds.  There were a couple of very old pe
ople, several old people.  And the next morning 
they tried them in groups of four for disturbi ng th
e peace.  And I sat through those trials.  He sent 
them all, he convicted them in groups.  They di
dn™t have any lawyers and so he convicted them 
all in groups for disturbing the peace.  And they se
nt them to the state penitentiary.  And so, we 
filed a court action to try to ge
t them out.  And it was called th
e United States against LeFlore 
County.  And I worked on, I went to that peni
tentiary every day for a couple of weeks to 
interview people.  It was a very long delayed 
pr oceeding.  And actually the Federal judge said 
that we should have, that he woul
d not interfere with this arrest 
because it was a state law ma tter, 
this disturbing the peace.  So, we eventually
 got the National Council of Churches to put up 
enough bond to get most of them– they did let some  
of the older people out in a few days.  But 
it was a horrendous thing.  I™ve forgotten the name of
 this Justice of the Peace.  It will come , I 
could reme mber it.  But I reme mber going to th
e penitentiary every day.  The guy™s name  was 
Arterberry, the warden.  He had this
 huge Great Dane that 
I did not like at all.
  But it was sort of 
the climate, you know, here they are, they arrest
 all these– they really we ren™t doing anything.  

They were complaining about this smoke bomb. 
 So we brought this action complaining about 
their interfering with their right to vote.  It wa
s not really the most successful thing we had ever 
done.  I think we should have won 
the case, but we didn™t.  And we
 did eventually get them out 
of jail with the help of th
e Kentucky Council of Churches, 
I mean the Na tional Council of 
Churches.  That was probably ‚
63, I guess.  The LeFlore theater cases, which we eventually won, 
I felt really– this ma n, Marchand, had worked for this
 theater chain all his lif
e.  And they really 
just– as the result of his doing 
what his bosses told him to do, th
ey just ostracized that ma n in 
the community.  I mean they thought it was li
ke he was the one who was responsible for 
everything, for having done this.  That he shoul
d have quit the job or 
said, ﬁ We™re not doing it 
here.  Whites are going to quit going to the theater.ﬂ
  He was this nice ma n, who had lived there 
all of his life.  His whole lif
e was the movie theater and people comi ng to the movies, and 
everybody knew him and liked him.  And his life 
was decima ted over that incident.  Greenwood 
was a very, you know there was a lot of civ
il rights activity all summer long there. 
 

Q: Can you name some of the 
leaders who you worked with? 
 

A: Well you know, that was, you know the SNCC he
adquarters was there and Stokely Ca rmichael
26
 
and Bob Moses
27
, who™s now up in Boston, I understand.  
And I™ve been meaning to try to

contact him because he™s developed a system for 
teaching ma th to inner city kids and algebra, 
apparently, that is very successful.  That™s, it to
tally changed, in changing 
his life.  I spent some 
time with Medgar Evers
28
, not much.  He was in, he wasn™t
 in LeFlore County, but I had me t 
him.  And after he was killed– I had actually been
 to his house not too long before that.  There 
was a recent issue in a magazine of The Wa shingt
on Post, which the writer had sent to me .  And 
there was a fellow named Willie McGee, who was ei
ther on the cover or on the insi de section of 
that– I me a n I guess there was a young woma n name d June J ohnson.  Fannie Lou Hame r was in 
Sunflower County
29
.  I don™t know if you ever saw that, bu
t there is a one wo ma n play about the 
life of Fannie Lou Ha me r.  She™s a wo ma n who grew up on a far m and became  a real strong 

voting rights activist.  And one of the first cas
es I ever worked on involved a situation where 
Fannie Lou Ha me r and June Johnson and a beautif
ul woma n name d Annelle Ponder.  June was 
then about fifteen or sixteen, I think.  And th
ere was another young ma n.  They had been to a 
voting rights workshop in Atlanta and they were 
comi ng home to, well they were coming home.  
Annelle was comi ng back with them, because she 
lived in Atlanta, but Ms. Hamer was over in 
Sunflower County and June Johnson was in Gr
eenwood.  And the bus stopped in Wi nona, 
Mississippi which had a bus station. 
 Wi nona is in Alabusha County
30
.  Anyway it was on the 
ma in road south and they got off the bus and wanted
 to get a Coke.  And went into the restaurant, 
which had– and they called the, the restaurant 
owners called the police and the local police 
came and arrested them off the bus.  Ca me  and 
arrested them and took them to jail and beat 
them, and– in the jail.  Couple of
 officers beat them.  And they

go.

Tape 5, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number five, 
side A of an interview with John Rosenberg.  You filed a police 
brutality case? 
 

A: Yeah, against those police officers.  And one
 of the– it was difficult to prove who did the 
beating, or that there was, other than from theblacks having said they were beaten.  They beat, 

actually beat, Mrs. Hame r had a hip injury.  She 
had worked in the cotton fields for some  reason 
and they even, she was on a bunk and they hit her.
  But the FBI had not found any witnesses and 
we knew there was a trusty in the jail, who wa
s actually a black ma n, w
ho played a guitar and 
who was sort of in and out of that jail because 
he drank.  But we knew he was there a lot.  And 
they said they could not locate him, a s  was th
e case often.  And I reme mbe r  that I found him, 
fi nally through talking to me mbers in the blac
k community, I learned wh
ere he lived.  And I 
eventually went out to see him and it happened to
 be on the day President Kennedy was killed in 
1963.  It was raining like cats and d
ogs and I was still in the local 
hotel.  And I went out to find 
and I found the trusty, this trusty.  And he identi
fied the officers from the pictures I had.  And 
then he told me  that he had, that after they 
had beaten these young blac
k, well they were really 
quite– men and women, that Mrs. Hamer, I guess,
 was on a cot then.  That after they were 

through and put them back in their cells, they to
ld him to mo p the blood off the floor, which he 
did.  And he testified to that, to 
hi s everlasting credit.  But the jury
 was an all-white jury and they 
acquitted them on a Friday afternoon in a veryshort period of time.  The jury went out, the 

fellow who put the case on was named St. John 
Barrett, who was the Second Assistant of the 
Civil Rights Division, who 
is a good friend of mi ne
31
.  And it was, we did have the U.S. 
Attorney, H.M. Ray, at the table, which was someth
ing new.  He was at l
east there.  He was a 
presence.  But the governme nt had not yet begun 
a policy of challenging juries there, so there 
was an acquittal.  And I then 
had to– I drove over to Sunflower County to see Mrs. Ha me r 
afterwards, I think.  I don™t know if they were stil
l there during the acquittal
.  I always feel badly 
and I think St. John Barrett, whose nickname  is ﬁS
lim,ﬂ who is still practi
cing law, never really 
forget that acquittal of that really horrible act
ion.  You know, it was just very blatant and such a 
commentary on the way things still were in 196
3.  You couldn™t get a white jury, even in a 
Federal court, to convict on that
 set of facts.  But we had brought the case, and that was only a 
year, well it was a few years later, 
of course, that the civ
il rights worker trial went off.  And that 
was an all-white jury, too. 
 

Q: Do you remember, befor e  you go on to that, how
 Mrs. Hame r was afterwards when you visited 
her?  
 

A: Well, she was a very rema rkable woma n, I thou
ght.  And I read an autobiography about her not 
too long ago.  She grew up on a farm and was 
not a very well-educated person, but she was a 
very, became a very fiery person, and spoke atthe De mocratic National Convention.  I me an I 

think she was very disappointed.  I think there wa
s a lot of criticism by the activist bl acks at the 
time, not just in this case, about why the government wasn™t doing more.  And so I think she sort 

of took this loss as one of ma ny losses along 
the way.  There was a voting rights case in 
Sunflower County–you know, we were lawyers who 
spent a lot of time in the community, but 
we would go back to Washington.  And one of 
the demands that was never met and probably

rightly so, was the blacks wanted mor e  protections
.  They wanted federal ma rshals when they 
went to register.  And they wanted more lawy
ers, and Congress wasn™t going to do that.  And 
there was still the question of 
how much, what do the states do 
and what the federal governme nt 
does and the evolving law.  And I think SNCC, we, 
oftentimes those of uswho were there in our 
coats and ties and with our federal ID badges, so
me  of the more activist 
people thought we were 
just sort of window dressing.  And you know, it 
was not the same  as direct action.  And 
eventually I think Mart
in Luther King certainly demonstrated that ma rching and non-violence 
was the key to success. That mobilizing blacks themselves, in the march in Selma–  I mean I 
think all of these things that were going on were part of the big 
picture.  I think the Division had 
a very prominent role, a very pronounced role th
at isn™t always recognize
d.  Not just because I 
was there, because I think we demonstrated that
 the court, that using the court syst em was 

extremely slow and wasn™t going to
 answer this– that we could wi
n one little case at a time , but, 
and that was doing some  good.  And we were starti
ng to– that that was helping.  And it also 
gave blacks some  confidence to wi
n.  But for the broader picture to
 change , we also he lped write 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Tha t  Congress– you 
had to do more than that.  And I think the 
civil rights, I think in a lot of
 these struggles, things like whet
her it™s the Wall comi ng down or 
whatever it is, some one, it always seems to take 
an incident like the civil rights workers™ death
32
 
to wake people up, unfortunately.  I mean it™s, 
there are mi ning disasters that cause the mi ne 
safety laws to come  in.  The three– the publicit
y in Selma, in Birmingham with the water hoses.  

It all, I think, helped mo bili
ze the country to change things. 
 We started, I mean I think the 
conviction of the civil rights workers in 1964, whic
h took a great deal of 
help by this all-white 
jury in Mississippi and by, where you had a 
presiding federal judge
, who was clearly a 
segregationist: Senator Ea st
land™s roomma te, Judge Cox
33
.  I think he said, 
ﬁThis is enough, and 
he™s going to have a fair trial.ﬂ  
And that was a little step along 
the way.  It took a great deal of 
work. 
 
Q: I have a couple of questions.  When you were 
talking about the case that you worked on in which 
Fannie Lou Ha me r and June Jordan [sic] and the othe
rs were beaten in jail.  Your exact role in 
that was, were you the only lawyer working on that?    
 
A: I was the, really the investiga
ting lawyer.  I hadn™t been in the 
Division that long and so I was, I 
guess you would call, that™s what you would call it. 
 I spent the time in th
e field and interviewed 
these folks and got the case pretty much ready for 
trial.  And St. John Barrett was the trial lawyer 
and I assisted him with putting it on and was in th
e courtroom.  I didn™t, I 
don™t think I examined 
any of the witnesse s in that cas
e.  But being in Mississippi I 
sort of would have written the 
request for investigation by the FBI with John. 
 And I went down and was the contact, and 
interviewed all these people who were eventually
 to testify and others 
in the community.  And 
sort of put the case together.  I mean that was 
the way we norma lly did all those cases.  Over 
time that™s also how we learned who the people 
were in the black community.  I me an we did

 In 1 964  threeciv il righ ts work ers

have very good contacts all over 
the state, in all th
ese counties where we worked.  And I think 
that was very helpful. 
 
Q:  Did you spend time with them socially? 

 

A: Oh, I probably had, I had quite a few meals in 
various, you know, they were like country people 
everywhere.  We  did not go out toge
ther.  I went to a lot of church– meetings in churches.  Did 
a lot of observing also, I mean sometimes when th
ere were ma rches– I™ve got some  photos I can 
show you that I still have from, like from Louisi
ana.  I spent a summer 
in Bogalusa, where the 
Klan had been taking a lot of action, was upset 
because, initially because a relatively moderate 
congressman had been invited to come  to speak: Brooks Hays
34
.  And the Klan rallied.  And they 
threatened to boycott stores that
 were going to sell to 
blacks.  And there we
re a number of civil 
rights ma rches during the summer, t hat 
summer with James Farmer and others
35
.  And I was, 
spent the summer there, basically observing marc
hes, interviewing people 
and getting the facts 
together for an action that we were, eventually fi
led against the Klan in 
federal court to get an 
injunction against them from doing, interfering a
ny further.  Again it was tied to voting and to 
public accommodations and employme nt.  So in ma
ny of these cases in t
hose earlier years I had 
a– my i mmediate boss was a fellow name d B
ob Owen, who was from Te xas and who passed 
away a few years ago
36
.  He was involved in some  of those trials.  He was in charge of 
Mississippi.  There was some body in charge of 
Mississippi, some body in c harge of Alabama and 
some body– Bob had gone to the University of Texas Law School.  He had gone to Princeton.  

He grew up on a farm al so, in Texas.  Wonderful 
ma n.  So, essentially in 
those early years, the 
FBI had not been very effective.  Things really
 changed after the civil 
rights workers incident.  
After that, they moved a  lot of agents from othe
r parts of the country to
 Mississippi and Alabama 
and began to use agents who did not live and grow
 up in those areas to 
investigate ci vil ri ghts 
matters.  Is that– I can™t reme mber what the question was.  I think I™m a little punchy, from this 
four o™clock in the morning thing. 
 
Q: (Laughing.)  I was asking you about 
your role in the, in that partic
ular trial.  I™m not sure if I 
asked you a question after that or not. 
 

A: Oh, you asked me  about, yeah, about the June Johnson, the case in Wi nona.  That was the way 
we generally did our– and the bigg
er cases like this three civil 
rights workers case, there were 
ma ny of us who– 
 

Q: The Neshoba County– 

 

A: The Neshoba County case, there were a number 
of us who did investigative work, both in the 
black community– we had a lot of FBI agents.  A
nd initially the Bureau reports turned up a lot 
of other examples of police brutality.  And when
 we convened the first grand jury, there were 
some indictments about other case
s, not involving the three civil 
rights workers, because there 
was not yet any clear confession 
to who had done that or what 
had happened.  The grand jury,

that one or the second one– I was in, it was sit
ting in Oxford and I was interviewing people and 
putting them on a plane fr om Jackson to Oxford 
to the grand, where they
 were testifying.  We  
did a lot of, but our, we as lawyers did a lot of
 investigative work, especially in the black 
community, because the level of trust was a lot 
bigger.  Because the whites– the Bureau in 
those earlier days was not, ma de it pretty plain,I think, that they were not sympathetic to the 
civil rights struggle, or some  of the m did.  Ot
hers were, the one in Meridian, the FBI agent in 
Meridian, Mississippi was actua
lly a very fine ma n, who was 
very much involved in that 
investigation from the beginning.   
 

Q:  What was his name ?  

 

A:  Well, I don™t reme mber his name  right now.  I mean it™s in my notes somewhere.  And there was 
a television movie ma de  about it,which was pretty accurate, which put him in the correct light .  

The Mississippi Burning, which so many people ha
ve seen, which was sort of a fictionalized 
account and always said it didn™t 
attempt to be accurate.  Whe n 
I have given these talks from 
time to time and they always say, ﬁWhat happened?  
 Is this the way it wa
s? ﬂ  And it wasn™t, I 
don™t think that was really the way the FBI norma
lly acted.  I thought that the picture depicted 
the hostility of whites quite well at the time.  Bu
t my role in that, besides investigating, I spent 
about a month tryi ng to put together, putting 
together a notebook on the background of the 
jurors.  You know, the jury list was like sixty or 
seventy people we knew from which the eleven 
jurors would be chosen. 
 

Q: Are you talking about 
the Neshoba County case? 
 

A: Yeah, in fact Jean and I ha
d just gotten ma rried and we cam
e back from our honeymoon.  And it 
was right before the trial of this case and so I, I 
said I really want to go.  So I did.  And that™s 
what I spent the month doing before the trial, inte
rviewing.  Today they have all these very fancy 
jury experts.  They even practice trials in fr
ont of a jury to see how
 a practice jury would do 
things, especially in the civil cas
es, not so much the criminal cas
es.  And then I 
spent a lot of– 
so I did that.   
 

Q:   I™m curious about, when you talk about inte
rviewing the jurors.  How did you, what did you do?   
Did you take notes?   What was your me thod? 
 

A: Well, you wouldn™t go see the juror.  You™
d go see people you trusted who mi ght know the 
jurors.  ﬁDo you know, who is this person?   Who ar
e they related to?  How long have they lived 
here?   How would you expect them t o, would you e
xpect them to be fair?  Have you, are they a 
me mber of the citizens™ council?  Who do they em
ploy? ﬂ  Many of those for ms, I me an today if 

you go, if you™re going to be selected for jury du
ty, you fill out a form which gives out a fair 
amount of very basic information that ev
erybody has access to.  And– where you work, that 
kind of thing.  This is a way of trying to put to
gether a picture about a 
juror without contacting 
the juror directly and tryi ng to 
be some what respectful of the ju
ror and also, not to infringe on 
anybody™s rights, but simply trying to learn as 
much as you can.  Some  things are public 
information.  I mean back then those were, system
s were just being developed and we had a jury 
that had some blacks on them.  And there were some
 me mber s of the, say you have to identify in 
Neshoba County in those communities, from– which 
was fairly large, the federal jury was from 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
60

a larger geographical area.  And you ma ke some
 decisions about paring 
down these numbers, 
about which jurors, somebody from Jackson ma y be 
from a large me tropolitan area and president 
of this comp any or that company, that you ma y 
not spend as much time on.  But I assembled a 
notebook for John, who was going to try the case, so
 when he got ready to challenge jurors– 
you have so ma ny pree mptory jurors.  I mean sup
pose, it ma y not be initially apparent, but from 
talking to people and identifying fo
lks, you mi ght find that a particul
ar juror is distantly related 

to some body, one of the defendants.  Or that
 his daughter is ma rried
 to some body™s son, who 
works for– and when the judge says, asks thejury, ﬁAre you related to
 anyone who is being 
defended?ﬂ  Nor mally if you are, 
you™re not going to be
 on that jury.  We l l , if you™re not being 
forthright, if you have some  infor mat ion that gi
ves the lawyer, like John, the opportunity to ask a 
question about it.  And then lawyers have thei
r own hunches about– every trial lawyer has their 
own– John always said he wouldn™
t like, didn™t want jurors that
 wore white socks.  I don™t 
know why.  I™m wearing white socks today.  It wa
s a thing, might have co
me from his accident 
cases.  I don™t know if he even lived, whether 
that was some thing he really, always– I™m sure 
that he used my notebook, primarily.  But that
 was– I did some  other work, I me an, other 
investigative work in the case, but I interviewed 
lots of other people.  But that was something 
I™ve always been proud of, because we got a conv
iction.  We  did get a jury that convicted a 
number of these people. 
 

Q: That was in 1967.  
Is that right?    
 

A: Yeah, the case had happened in 1964, but the de
lay, the defendants challenged the legality of the 
indictme nt under federal law.  So, the case actua
lly went to the United States Supreme Court on 
the legal question.  This was not a murder conv
iction.  You know, it was a– they were charged 
with conspiring to deprive the defe
ndants of their civil 
rights.  It™s a federa
l conspiracy charge.  
There was an issue of whether that was a crime, 
because it involved private indi viduals as well as 
some law enforcement.  And the Supreme Court in
 that case said, yes it wa s a crime.  And so 
then, all that took time, so it wasn™t until 1967 that 
the trial actually took place.  And when I left, 
one of the last things that I did in 1970 when we 
left, was to write a brief.  They were about to 
be, they were still trying to pr
event them fr om their arrest .  They were still raising legal 
questions.  And I think that– and we
 were successful in resisting the objections and they finally 
then took the people who had been 
convicted Œ they weren™t all c
onvicted Œ to jail, where they 
served their time.  And I understa
nd that they are today, finally, wh
at is this?   1999
?   Thirty-two 
years later they are thinking about charging th
em with murder, convening a state grand jury 
finally.  As they did in the Beckwith case.
37
   
 

Q: Why didn™t they do that at the time? 

 

A: Well, they di dn™t do it because the state of Miss
issippi was not going to take any, I think, serious 
action in racial cases.  There 
were just too much, the official
s were unwilling to risk their 
political life.  I mean, people in Mississippi, I 
think very substantial num
bers still thought these 
were outsiders who had come  in to tell them
 what to do.  They were not sympathetic to 
registering blacks.  ﬁThey should have stayed home
.  They had it comi ng to them.ﬂ  All that kind 
                                                 
37
 In 1999 , th e state of Mississippireopened th e investig ation in to  th e Mississippi Bu rn ing case. In 2001 , ho wever,

of sorts of terrible ideas, but 
it was, but that was– you know, they called it Freedom Summer.  
They had these workshops, students from all over 
the country in 1964 were there.  And that was 
why I was in Mississippi when it happened.  Some
 of us ha ppened to be there.  I was in 
Greenwood, I believe when this went on in Neshoba County. 
 

Q: You were in Greenwood during the ti
me  of the murder, 
the disappearance? 
 

A: Right.  My friend Frank Schwelb
38
, who is now a judge in the D.C. Circuit, was the lawyer, I 
think, who was actually in Neshoba County, and 
called John, these sort of things were 
happening.  I don™t know that– I don™
t think that I went over ther
e right away.  Because the FBI 
was out and they were trying to
 find the bodies.  I was involved 
in some matters in LeFlore 
County, but I was in Mississippi.  
All of us were there during the summer i n one way or another. 
 

Q: Were you ever personally threatened or di
d you feel personally threatened, being there? 
 

A: I™ve been asked that a lot.  I 
really didn™t, I think we, because 
we were Justice Departme nt people 
and generally people knew who we we
re.  After that I never felt re
ally in danger, particul arly 
after the Neshoba killings, we started always driv
ing together... in Neshoba
 County, at least, in 
pairs, being together with a
nother person who was working.  Be
fore that we were always, 
generally, by ourselves.   
 

Q: Were you arme d?  

 

A: No.  I never carried a weapon.  I was in a,
 in a registrar™s office once in Yazoo County, 
Mississippi.  And I was with 
a team of FBI agents, photograp
hing voting records.  And the 
registrar™s name  was ﬁFootﬂ Campbell.  While th
ey were photographing r
ecords, I went in hi s 
office and we were talking about a variety of thi
ngs and he related to me  that he had witnessed 
some  lynchings.  And I don™t know why– and I wasn™t
 going to try that case, I was just there 
with the FBI.  And he got started talking and th
en he said, ﬁJohn, let me  show you something.ﬂ  
And he pulled this gun out of his dr
awer and he shot his pistol into
 the floor in front of me .  And 
I said, ﬁWell, why did you do that?ﬂ  And he sa
id, ﬁ Well I just wanted to show you the gun 
worked.ﬂ  It was very odd.  He shot a big hole 
in his floor.  I think he
 was a little deme nted 
anyway.  But it was the only time I know that– 
and he wasn™t aimi ng at me.  But all these 
agents came  in.  Everybody heard this terrible 
noise in this old courthouse and came running in 
to see what had happened.  And he said, ﬁWell I ju
st wanted to show John this gun worked.ﬂ  But 
I never really was in fear, at l
east I don™t recall.  I think we all knew that we were in such a 
different situation from the people who we were 
working with.  I me an the blacks, who were so 
vulnerable, who were by themselves, who had to real
ly display such courage 
just to go register to 
vote.  We  met so ma ny wonderful people, these far mers, local citizens, who simply wanted to go 

register, to exercise thei
r right to vote.  I think you were me
ntioning what we were talking about 
the other day, how apathetic pe
ople are about voting today.  It
™s just quite– when you think 
about it, I mean I think that always, you just co
uldn™t help but be impressed by these folks, who 
were, ma ny of them were just hard-working peop
le, who wanted to have the same  opportunities 
or just to have the same  right as everyone else. 
 I mean it seems so very simple.  I will always 

reme mber a fe llow name d Eskridge.  There was 
a farmer name d William Eskridge in Carroll

County, Mississippi, who was really
 a very bright, articulate ma n, 
who lived in a farm, worked a 
far m that he owned, way out, by hims elf, out in 
a very isolated part of the county.  And they 
wanted thei r son to go to, to get a decent education and were willing to enroll hi m in a white 
school, a previously all-white school.  And we went
 to court to desegregat
e the school.  One of 
the earliest cases that the governme nt filed.  
There had been other sc
hool desegregation cases, 
but the United States didn™t have
 the authority prior to 1964 to 
initiate school desegregation 
cases.  We  could only do voting cases.  And we we
re able to– and whenever I went  to see him, 

which was ma ny, many times, I just always ma rv
eled at how isolated they were, and his 
willingness and his drive, just and his very simple
 desire to see the son go.  We had an expert 
come  in, and the black school was horrible.  It 
was the same  picture as it was with the voting 
thing.  They were in this old, rundown building 
with a pot-bellied stov
e.  I don™t remember 
whether there was running water or not.  But it wa s 
just an incredible contrast.  And actually he, I 
think he mi ght have been registered.  Ever
ybody knew him.  Everybody knew him.  And he had 
a very good reputation among the white community
 and ma ybe that was why he was not so 
afraid.  I mean he had a very nice persona
lity and he was obviously pretty bright–

Tape 5, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape nu
mber five, side B. 
 
A: Well, I just, you know, I think it™s some thing that 
we saw repeatedly.  It™s been probably eight or 
nine years, but a fellow, one of the people w
ho worked– well he didn™t work on that case, 
another lawyer who became  a judge, Nick 
Flannery, worked on that case with me
39
.  But one of 
our friends went by to see him ma yb
e eight or nine years ago.  I th
ink he™s died now.  Did he die 
recently?   Jean and I went to Holmes, went to on
e of those counties, no, tw
o or three years back 
and went to see him.  He ™s
 probably in his eighties now. 
 

Q: This is the father of the child who–? 

 

A: Right.  He had afterwards gotten involved 
in some  Mississippi poli
tics for a while and the 
Freedom De mocratic Party.  I don™t think he ever 
ran for office.  I always thought he should.  But 
there™s not much more to that 
other than– we won, the judge orde
red them to allow his child to 
go, Judge Clayton, to enter that grade.  And we so
rt of stayed in touch with each other for some  
time afterwards both in connection 
with that case, and whenever I would drive– and whenever I 
went to Mississippi after a while you get to 
know some  of these people and if you wanted to 
learn about what was going on in 
the community or whether there 
were some  other incidents we 
ought to be aware of, those were 
the sort of people who called you. 
 

Q: Did you say his name? 

 

A: It was William Eskridge.  I don™t know aboutthe son.  Did we meet the son who he was in 
school with?  Actually I have so
me  pictures at home .  It was not ma ybe three years ago.  The 
reason I said he died, I think 
some body told me .  One of the 
school classes in Holmes County, 
which is nearby, one of the high schools did a little 
project, they put a bookl
et together on sort of 
oral histories about black leaders 
in their area a few years ago.  A
nd it made its way to one of the 
legal services people who was living 
there.  And they sent it to me
 and there was an interview of 
Mr. Eskridge , who recalled the case we did.  I guess 
that™s really about it, except about, on this 
thing– we just saw those situations repeated over
 and over.  Every county went to wherever the 
governme nt was involved.  And today in legal se
rvices, I mean whenever you have a move me nt 
or you have an issue like this, some one is going t
o, or some  group is going to try, is going to 
stand out initially to see, try to 
help people get justice, or to see 
that the right result come s about.  
So, you have leaders like, you ma y never hear about
 Mr. Eskridge in Carro
ll County.  You mi ght 
hear about some  of the more promi nent, you proba
bly hear about Mrs., some  of the people, who 
went to the national scene, like Aaron Henry in
 Clarksdale, Mississippi,
 who was President of 
the NAACP,  also
40
.  Who™ s a very prominent figure and w
ho continued to be a prominent figure 
after these, in later days when the Voting Right
s Act was passed and blacks did get the right to 
vote.  Then if you go to Mississippi today, you see 
the number of black legislators, who are in 
the Mississippi legislature.  And that you had some
 part in, you see how far it™s come .  So there 
are a lot of unsung heroes, I think, lik
e Mr. Eskridge, in all these cases.

Q: I wanted to ask you kind of a general question. 
 I™m going to try to phras
e it clearly, but it mi ght 
not– take a little while.  You me ntioned some th
ing earlier about living 
in the South and how 
you wanted to live in the South and in a way you 
were proud of being a Southerner and you were 
aware of the things that were good and were mot i
vated to be there because of that... to change 
some  of the things that were not as good.  I ha
ve kind of the idea that so ma ny Northerners and 
ma ybe particularly Jews, who lived in the 
North, felt that the South was backwards and 
controlled by the Klan and there would be too 
much anti-Semitism and too much ma ybe lack of 
culture or something, putting it crudely or ma
ybe over-exa ggerating.  But I™m wondering what it 
was that you saw about living in the South that wa
s so positive, that ma de yourself identify as a 
Southerner and motivated you 
in this whole endeavor? 
 

A: I think it™s the same to some
 extent what you see in small town
s.  I thinkŠor the rural areasŠ
you get this, I mean in a simplistic wa y, the idea that people accept you for who you are.  As a 

salesman I always used to say in the South if you have a customer, they™re going to initially 

assume  you are telling the trut h and will take yo
u, at face value, what you say, and will welcome 
you in, and be happy to spend the time  of day.  
And if you are fair with them, you ca n have a 
long lasting relationship as you woul
d with anyone else.  Whereas, 
if you were in the urban areas 
of the North, and then again this is very simplis
tic and probably not true 
in the sense that you can 
generalize, but I™m sure it indicates some  of 
the way that I think and 
others think.  In the 
Northern, when I was selling chemicals, I think 
in the North people say ﬁThis guy is a salesman, 
he™s out to get us and he™s going to be a con ma
n or con woman of one sort or another.ﬂ  And 
they have a much harsher attitude .  And ma ybe b
ecause these towns are, these cities are so big, 
are not interested norma lly in forming anot
her relationship and welcoming some one from 
another place that has nothing to do with wh
ere they live.  I think the camaraderie of 
communities, the fact that people are, whether it is
 a slower pace.  People do have an interest  in 
where they live and in ma king it, and in the se nse of place where they are.  I think that™s ma ybe 
true of smaller communities across the board.  I™m sure it™s true in New Hampshire and Vermont 
and in smaller places up North, but it was true of
 the South.  Much has been written about the 
South, I™m sure you™re familiar with literature of 
the South.  And I think th
ere is some of that 
commonality.  It™s like when I wa
s in the Civil Rights Division, be
ing a Southerner, itself, was 
probably helpful– it was helpful, I™m sure in 
many ways, especially in dealing with white 
officials.  I mean not that you would necessarily
 be their buddy, but they sure couldn™t– There™s 
some thing about being able to say, ﬁOh you™re from way up there in New York or you™re from– 

you don™t belong here.ﬂ  I mean, the South, I™m not 
proud of the Confederacy, but it™s part of its 
history.  And to that extent, I think that™s why–
 I mean I like the tradition and the atmosphere 
and the welcoming of those communities, they we
re– with my fa mily.  We were strangers in 
this county, in Spartanburg and in Gastonia, and 
it became our home.  And I think that it made a 
great deal of difference.  And I suppose, I don™t k
now, I haven™t read as much about that, but we 
had ma ny as sociations and ma ny mo re friends w
ho were not Jewish than the ones who were, 
probably because of our, because of the economics of
 the situation.  I mea n in a sense you have a 
sort of a class system, keeping up with the Jone
ses.  Those people were we ll off and they were 
friends in the synagogue and were always very
 nice, but we weren™t– they would, you know, go 
to Florida, or they would trav
el, and do things that my fa mily
, my parents didn™t do, because we 
couldn™t afford it, because they weren™t interested 
in it.  So, I think that™s the way it is.  I mean, 
it™s the same  way I feel about being here in some ways.  Been here almost thirty years and it™s 

become home.  And I think the people here shar
e that same  kind of feeling about their place and

their community, and Appalachia, it™s different th
an North Carolina, but it™s the same  sort of 
environment.   
 
Q: Did your work change a whole lot after the Civil Rights Act passed? 

 

A: In the Division?   We ll, we had more work in mor e  areas.  And after I worked in the Deep South, 
I became a Chief of what was called the We stern 
Section.  I started doing some cases in Texas 
and in Nevada.  I litigated a case against the El ect
rical Workers Union in Las Vegas, believe it or  
not.  They didn™t want to let blacks, who were el
ectricians, into the union.   Steel workers in Los 
Angeles.  In my section in Texas, I didn™t have 
any– well, I did, spent the 
last two years or three 
years in a case against the H
ouston school system.  A big de
segregation case involving the 
Houston school system.  We moved to Houston 
for several months, prepared this case that I 
tried.  But it had been an ongoing case in Housto
n.  And then I was also, I guess I became the 
Chief of what is known as the Crimi nal Secti
on of the Civil Rights Division.  Which is the 

section that has responsibility for the police br ut
ality cases, these conspira
cy cases like the civil 
rights workers.  I didn™t, I was in charge of that
 and had a group of lawyers working with me  and 
for me  and the FBI.  And the last thing I did was di
rect an investigation into the Kent State case.  

But that™s about the time I left , so I didn™t really
 get involved in very ma ny more trials.  The 
Houston case took a couple of years, off and on.  
I think I was actually th
e– was I the Chief of 
the We stern Section?   Maybe part of it was st
ill going on when I was Chief of the Criminal 
Section.  In all these, by that 
time the Division had gotten a lot 
bigger and it was sort of a re-
organization and I had eight or ten lawyers wo
rking under me .  And we were doing cases around 
the United St ates.  After the Civil Rights Act 
and then the Voting Rights Act was 1965, then I 
was in what we called the Sout
heastern section, that was Alab
ama and Louisiana.  And I did 
spend some  time in Louisiana working on the, wh
en they first brought in
 federal observers to 
watch elections, because under the Voting Rights 
Act people could regi ster automatically by 
signing their name .  In those southern states we
re covered by that.  Then in 1964, the case that 
Jean was talking about, we had a case in Selma, 
Alabama, which was the first– I™m sorry it was 
1965.  It was the first case under 
the Voting Rights Act in Selma,
 where they were still using 
paper ballots.  And it was the fi
rst election in which black offi
cials, where blacks had been 
appointed to be election 
officials.  And it was very interestin
g.  Jim Clark, who was the Sheriff of 
Selma and had been such a repressive force in 
Selma, was running for re-election.  There was a 
moderate name d Wilson Baker.
41
  The election officials who were
 black had never done that and 
they were counting all these ballot
s and they wanted to be sure, th
ey were trying to be careful.  
And it was taking them a very long time  to finish 
counting the ballots at th
e end of the day.  And 
all the boxes had come back in from the white 
precincts.  And so the executive committee me t, 
which was an all-white, democratic executive
 committee and they decided they would impound 
all of the– there must be some thing wrong, th
ese people are taking too long.  There must be 
some  sort of fraud going on.  So they went out
 and impounde d all those ballots.  And the next 
day decided that they would, the fa
ir thing to do is not to count th
e ballots in those boxes at all, 
just leave them out as a group, which had the eff
ect of not counting probab
ly ninety-five percent 
of the black ballots that had b
een cast.  So we filed an act
ion under the Voting Rights Act to 
require them to count those ball
ots.  We went to federal cour
t and we got a judge name d, whose

name was Thomas
42
, who had refused to desegregate the 
Mobile County, Louisiana schools.  
Each year he™d do just a little tiny bit and we™d, 
the government would appeal.  The next year the 
Court of Appeals would tell him to do some thing 
more and he would only do a little tiny bit.  So, 
he effectively kept them from being desegregate
d.  But when we put this case on and I tried this 
case and John, for a change, John told me  the da
y before the trial, he said, ﬁ Why don™t you try 
this case, John? ﬂ  We  had been putting it toge ther.  
He was my assist ant, if you will.  (Laughing.)   
The objections, some  obj ections, I put the case on
 and he did the opening and he also did the 
closing.  He did a very nice job.  And Judge Thomas
 said that, he required them to count them.  
And he said, ﬁYou should not deprive a voter of 
his right to vote based on what mi ght be a 
technical mi stake by an election offi
cial.  And we showed that all 
the ballots were in the boxes.  
There was no fraud.  The number of people who si
gned in to vote equaled the number of ballots.  
There mi ght have been one or two slight differen
ces, but basically we proved that all the ballots 
were there and what they were doing was pe
rfectly good.  There was no reason not to count 
them.  So he  ordered them to be counted and th
e result was that Jim Clark was out.  We didn™t 
file the action to get Ji m Clark decl ared inelig
ible or anything.  We  
filed the suit under the 
Voting Rights Act, in order to have those votes c
ounted as they ought to be
 counted, so that their 
right to vote was protected and th
eir vote would be counted.  But 
it was the end of Jim Clark as 
an elected official in the county.  
So, I was always very pleased to 
have participated in that case. 
 

Q: What year was that? 

 

A: That was 1960, probably 1966.  I™d say ‚65, I think the decision was in ‚66.  Because the Voting 
Rights Act was passed in 1965, which really changed everything.  I mean, across the South there 

were black sheriffs, in these count
ies that had more blacks than wh
ites or heavy black counties.  I 
think it was really probably the most important
 legislation in ma ny wa
ys passed anywhere.  
Because it really gave blacks the right to
 vote and changed the political process. 
 

Q: Did you have anything to do with writing 
that legi slation, the Voting Rights Act? 
 

A: I, I mean it wasn™t me  personally, the Di
vision, the lawyers in th
e Division, John and our 
appellate section, Burke Marshall, who was at that
 time  not the Assistant 
Attorney General, but 
he was still very– became  a profess or at Yale
.  But the lawyers in the Division and in the 
hierarchy of the Department of Justice– some  
of that language, some  of that Act was based on 
the court cases that we had bought.  It said if a 
certain percentage of vot
ers had not voted and if 

they used a test or device, like a 
literacy test , if these vari ous criteria were met then it triggered 
the application of the Voting Right
s Act.  And if that was trigge
red, the registration process then 
involved, meant that they had to al
low everyone to register by a ve
ry simple procedure.  And if 
they weren™t going to do that at
 the courthouse, they could do
 it where the federal observers 
were.  Or that they did it in the courthouse with
 federal observers looking on.  It is a forced 
process that covered vi rtually the entire South.  Th
ere was a challenge to the legality of that, that  
went to the United States Supreme Court, wh
ich was upheld.  I think 
United States versus 
Louisiana.  Well no, it wasn™t Louisiana.  Then th
ere was also, I was involved with the poll tax.  
The Southern states used poll taxes to prevent blacks from voting for ma ny years.  And so I filed 

an action in Mississippi and then I helped the A
ssistant Attorney Genera
l and put together the 
case against poll tax in Al abama.  Wh ich was a 
fair amount of my time.  In 1960– the poll tax

was probably the Voting Rights Act 
of ‚67, after Selma.  In ‚68, I think we  did that case, in 
Montgomery.   
 
Q: I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights Move
ment in general and yo
ur perceptions of its 
various goals and conflicts within the move
me nt.  You me ntioned SNCC being, and I thought 
maybe I should mention for the tape that, th
at™s the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating 
Committee.  Right?   I wa s thinking about that and 
the ideal of non-violence that King and people 
who worked in that spirit, people who work
ed with SNCC and people who worked in the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, vers
us Malcolm X and the Bl
ack Panthers, a little 
later on.  How did you perceive that?  I mean you
 were talking a little 
bit earlier about how you 
don™t, about non-violence and how
 you don™t feel that if you were
 in a situation like that you 
would just turn the other cheek and let 
some body gun down you or some body dear to you.  
Whereas King was very committed to non-violence a
nd some  of his followers were as well.  
What were your perceptions of th
at and of Malcolm X™s agenda? 
 

A: Well, I think that, I mean I mi ght tolerate so
me body throwing an egg in my face, especially when 
you are together with other people, you know. 
 I have a great respect for the non-violent 
move me nt and Gandhi and his teachings.  I think 
Martin Luther King and his idea about using 
non-violence as the way to demonstrate love 
for your fellow ma n and wo
man, and that you have 
to, that that was the way that 
would be most effective.  And that arme d, an arme d response 
wasn™t going to work.  It wasn™t going to work
 anyway because they didn™t have– a number of 
people were going to be killed. 
 People were killed along the way.  So, I mean, I™ m c onvinced 
really that you do, that the courts
 are only an adjunct to any move me
nt of that sort.  I me an the 
courts can help to insure that the ri ghts of i
ndividuals and groups are protected within a very, 
within a particular sphere or frame of referen
ce.  But as I said, the 
Voting Rights Act, I don™t 
think, would have been passed, certainly it wouldn
™t have been passed as quickly, and I™m not 
sure it would have been passed 
at all, without the Selma ma rc
h and the demonstrations and, I 
guess, Martin Luther King™s conviction that 
gradually the country 
would recognize how wrong 
segregation was and that you were simply trying to
 provide to all citizens of this country the 
rights to which they were secure.  I™m not, as 
far as Malcolm X and the Black Power Moveme nt, 
I™m not a, I don™t, I haven™t studied all of bl
ack history anymore than ma ny other subjects I 
haven™t studied.  I think that there is an awful– that it™s im
portant for these, for African-
Americans to recognize their history 
and their culture.  There™s a lot 
to be gained from that, just 
as it is in Appalachia.  Peopl
e ought to be, can be proud of th
eir culture.  And that you can do 
that in this country, within the 
confines of the law and that ther
e is room for us to have an 
integr ated social system, where groups that 
are Na tive Americans, and African-Ame ricans, and 
the various cultural, ethnic citizens who are comi ng 
to this country can sti
ll retain and recognize 
some  of their own history and preser
ve it.  And I think that™s really
 what he was, in part, talking 
about.  I suppose, whether Malcolm X would like to
 have separated this 
country into one that 
was white and black or not.  I™m not that familiar w
ith really everythi ng that he wrote.  But that™s 
the way I feel about that.  I don™t know that it m
eans how I would react in 
a particular situation.  
We don™t have any guns in our home, whereas– or 
in our cars.  (Laughing.)  And I don™t intend 
to carry any weapons or have them.  And 
ma ny, and in this area and the South, you know, you 
have a lot of hunters, which I am not.  And you have
 a lot of people who feel strongly about their 
right to bear arms in this area here, w
here we 
live.  And they can do that.  I would be happy for 
us to get rid of all the weapons 
in this country, hand guns.  I don™
t need them.  But that doesn™t

mean that I, to me  that if push came to shove, 
I might not feel it was th
e right thing to do.  Or 
that I would not be a conscientious objector  if Iwere called back into the military.  I think that™s 
where those lines are.  I don™t thi
nk it™s an absolute line.  For 
me , even though I would think, I do 
believe that non-violence has its 
place and that– if we can achieve
 the ends that we seek.  By 
mass marches, whether it™s for Vietnam or to 
break down barriers of se
gregation, then that™s 
what should be done. 
 

Q: What did your parents think 
of your civil rights work?    
 

A: They, I think, well, I think they were quite pr
oud of what I was doing.  I think they were quite 
proud of what I was doing.  I don™t know that my mo
m, I me an my father and mother more,  I 
don™t know that my fathe r  was totally convinced.  I 
think he was in some  ways, he was a little bit 

of an elitist intellectually.  As I said earlier, 
he was not, he was a very 
private person.  He really 
had a difficult time  ma king conversations with pe
ople who he didn™t feel 
had a great deal of 
education or that were on his leve l intellectually.  And in that wa
y he was a little bit of a snob, I 
think.  And so I don™t know that he was in total 
agreement with the use of the nation™s resources 
to desegregate.  I don™t know that he was, I thi
nk my Dad was n™t a racist
.  I don™t think in that 
way, I don™t know that we–

Tape 6, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number six, side
 A of an interview with John Rosenberg.  So he wasn™t sympathetic 
to demonstrations? 
 
A: Well, I mean I think it™s complicated and hard to
 really articulate what  my
 dad™s feelings were.  I 
think they were very proud of 
the fact, after the fact.  I don™
t think they we re necessarily 
understanding about why I went to
 law school, when they thought 
I had already found a career.  
And had a good job.  Wi thin the Jewish community
 for example, try to explain to some body why 
a ma n who is, let™s see how old was  I?   In ‚
59 I was twenty-eight.  Why anybody would want to 
go back to school.  I think they had the same  reac
tion when my sister went back to school.  You 
can™t tell them anymore that he™s a successful sa
lesperson going, selling ch
emicals.  You always 
want to tell some body your kids are doing some th
ing that™s fine and they™re well and they™re 
taking care of themselves, whethe
r it™s a chemical salesman, or
 doing great things, ma king a lot 
of money, which is what the Jewish community wa
nts to hear, that peop
le are ma king a lot of 
money, which is their sym
bol of success.  Maybe my mother mo
re than my father.  So when I 
went to law school.  But they were very, I think 
they were very impressed by and large with the 
lawyers and associates that I me
t in the Civil Rights Division.  
And certainly having the Division 
and John and the people who– I mean we didn™t 
have the Kennedys come to our wedding, but 
everybody, a lot of the people from the Justice De
partme nt and the Civil 
Rights Division and our 
associates.  So, I think they were
 really, as a general ma tter, ve
ry pleased with what I was doing 
as a lawyer and the work I did there.  And the wo
rk I did here.  I think they would never, there 

was always the question of why I did I just not 
go into a law fi rm a
nd ma ke a whole lot of 
money?   (Laughing.)  Why spend your time doing th
is public service work
?   Which people still 
don™t understand, not only about me , but about a lot 
of other people who work here and work in 
other programs.  The work that many people in 
Social Services do and maybe that people do as 
writers or artists, where they™re tryi ng to live out
 their life in a way they ar e comfortable with 

and like, which ma y not be financially very reward
ing.  But that that™s no
t the test for them and 
probably it ought not to be the te
st in my mi nd.  So, it™s hard– 
so I think they were very, you 
know, when I received some  awards later on for my 
work here and that sort of thing, parents are 
always going to be happy with some thing li
ke that.  But I think my dad was kind of a 
complicated man when it came to the racial thing, because he worked on a daily basis in his 

factory and I think saw– was not as ready to be
lieve that if you give 
everybody a chance, that 
poverty is like a vicious circle. 
 If you live in a very poor environment you are going to have 
illiteracy, you™re going to have 
drugs, you™re going to have alcohol abuse and substance abuse.  
And if you don™t look, if you aren™t 
willing to deal with the causes, and you aren™t willing to try 
to deal with the elimination of poverty at that le
vel, it™s easy to say, ﬁThese folks are always– 
they™re drinking, they could be– th
ey drop out of school, and it™s al
l their fault.ﬂ  And the next 
thing you know– and they™re certa
inly true of– there are more
 poor white people in this 
country than there are blacks. 
 But if you look at it as a 
Southern phenome non or where you 
lived–  I think that someone like my father, w
ho had a history in the Jewish community, where 
we™re too often too quick to say, ﬁWe were able 
to take care of ourselves despite all this 

repression.  We ca me  out of Ger many, with onl
y the clothes on our b
acks and nothing in our 
pocket and look what we did.  Why c a n™t they do th
e same  thing?   The same  thing? ﬂ  People say, 
ﬁLook at Asians, Japanese have come  to this co
untry and whose kids achieve, who are motivated 
to achieve.™

Q: What™s your response to 
that kind of rema rk?     
 

A: Well, I mean, I think it™s the same  sort of drivin
g force, in a way, that says
 they are, historically 
have valued education, and have seen that if 
you get an education, that
 you are motivated to 
succeed and you can be some one.  And I think Af
rican-Americans see that, too.  But I think, I 

think, as I say, part of it is a vici
ous circle, part of it is, that™s 
what Jean does, some times it™s one 
at a time , that people who are 
born into these poor ec
onomic circumstances, we have a whole 
generation, we have several generations of welf
a r e in Eastern Kentucky and in the South.  And 
it™s hard to break that cycle in a variety of s
ituations, people, and we– 
I don™t know that welfare 
reform isn™t all bad.  It can be done, in my mi
nd, and I think Jean™s, in a more humane way.  But 
people have to have some  support systems, and if
 you come  out from, if you have a series of 
generations where education isn™t valued, for ex
ample in Eastern Kentucky you could get a very 
good job mi ning coal, you didn™t need an educati
on for years and years and generations, all you 
had to do– I mean, it was hard work, dangerous 
work in some  ways.  
But it was the kind of 
work that people knew.  It was all manual labor.  
As that ends, people don™t have those jobs, and 
they don™t have the options, they find themselves in
 those situations where 
there is disparity, they 
have to leave.  And I think the black, in th
e South, you have the history of segregation for a 
couple of hundred years, where you don™t have 
equal opportunity.  Where you have terrible 
schools, and where you™re expected to be a sharec
ropper, really don™t have 
an equal opportunity.  
Then you can™t have, those children can™t have th
e expectations of being successful.  Now people 
debate that nationally.  Bl ack lead
ers debate that, you hear it all th
e time.  ﬁ We can be successful.  
We should not have Affirmative Action.ﬂ  I thi
nk Affirmative Action has be en a very successful 
tool.  But the pendulum has sw
ung.  Now you find Justice Thomas
43
, and you find black leaders 
who say, ﬁAffir mative Action is unfair.  It™s unfair to
 whites.  It™s unfair in
 that it gives, we don™t 
need an unfair advantage,ﬂ or to label it as an unf
air advantage.  To some  extent it™s subjective.  
Those are my own feelings about– I think you do have to make additional opportunities 

available to people who have been 
historically discrimi na
ted against.  We  have had it and to try 
to isolate that advantage to those very few s
ituations where you can actually prove that this 
company discrimi nated in this bad wa y and so 
they™re supposed to overcome that.  But I don™t, 
and I don™t think my dad, anymore than anybody else
, was– I certainly wish he had been more 
broadminded about that, I™m just saying he™s not 
perfect, none of us are perfect and he had his 
imperfections and that was one of them.  As fa
r as philosophically, he
 didn™t go around ma king 

speeches about it.  But I think he was still pr
oud of what I was doing.  I think it was easy, he 
would be the first, among others, he would sa
y, ﬁWell they should be, certainly not prevent 
people,ﬂ think it was wrong to try to
 enforce the right to vote or even the right to go to public 
facilities or to have the same  legal rights as everyone else. 
 

Q: Do you think that your awareness of and to some  
extent your direct experi
ence of persecution of 
the Jews during World War II, affected your, influen
ced your interest in working for civil rights 
for blacks?  
 

A: Oh, I™m sure it did.  I™m sure that my  histor
y and the persecution that 
Jews had, what we went 
through as a fa mily and as Jews had a lot to do with
 my wanting to participate in the Ci vil Rights 
Moveme nt.

Q:  You talked–  

 

A:  (Talkover.)  It™s the same  thing.  I mean it is 
essentially the same  thing. 
 In a different way.  I 
mean it™s the mi streatment of blacks, maybe it 
isn™t genocide, but there were certainly the 
lynching periods when many blacks we
re killed.  Not in the scale th
at we™re used to here, that 
was true in the Holocaust .  But I think it™s the sa
me thing that motivates, helped to motivat e me 
to work there.  And work in legal services
, where you™re essentially
 trying to do some thing 
similar to that on an individual basis.  To provi
de those opportunities so 
that people are at least 
even in the courts and 
that they can find lawyers to advocat
e their positions, which they, in the 
courts, which they otherwise wouldn™t be able 
to do.  And I™ve said ma ny times, I think it™s the 
ma rk of, a good ma rk, one of the thi
ngs that this country ought to be
 proud of, is the fact that it 
does fund programs like ours, so that people, and 
provide lawyers to low-
income  people.  And 
even makes it possible to sue th
e government if necessary, that biting the hand that feeds you, if 
you have to.  You don™t have to do that as much 
as we did.  But we don™t get the funds that we 
ought to have, that™s regrettable.  Just as regret
table as it was that it took so long to get to the 
days of the civil rights, it took– Brown against 
the Board of Education is 1954 and we aren™t 
fully at the end of it yet,
 with regard to higher education.  It 
takes thirty and forty years.  Court 
processes are slow.  But I thi
nk it all has to do with human 
rights, treating people, giving 
everyone the same  opportunity, whet
her they are young or old, or 
white or black, or– whoever. 
 

Q: Would you tell how you me t Jean? 

 

A: My wife, Jean? 

 

Q: Get a chance to fill in the record.  Your wife, Jean. 
 
A: I me t Jean in the Civil Rights Division of the De
partme nt of Justice.  She was, I was the Deputy 
of the Southeastern Section, which handled 
Alabama, Mississippi.  No Alabama and not 
Mississippi, then.  My sec
tion chief was Frank Dunbaugh
44
 and Jean came to the section as a 
research analyst, which she me ntioned to you.  
They are now called paralegals.  We  call them 
also admi nistrative representatives here.  They do
 a little different work in my organization.  But 

John Doar was invited to speak at Earlham College
45
 in Jean™s senior year
, or ma ybe her junior 
year.  Her roomma te, Dorothy, now Landsberg, was 
then name d Shelton, was in charge of the 

speaking program, and for some  reason she had h
eard about John Doar™s work and asked him to 
come to Earlham to speak.  And he came there a
nd then he, I believe first hired Dorothy for the 
summer to work for him and he also me t Jean. 
 Or she came to, or she came to Wa shi ngton.  I 
don™t know whether he hired her then.  They were
 about, they were the 
two, I think, the first 
research analysts.  Dorothy later on after I– a
nd so, Jean came to this section and we began 
working together.  Of course we were sort of
– I was second in charge of the section and she 
was working on cases, and so I think we once– a 
group of us went on a sk
iing trip and that was 
the first time we had any opportunity to be togeth
er socially.  ‚Cause 
we were still I guess 
drawing some  lines when we were at work.  
She was just a new e mployee and working under, 
not directly under me , but with so
me  other lawyers in preparing ca
ses.  What they would do is

analyze the documents, like the vo
ting records we brought back.  
We  simi l a rly started doing the 
same  thing with schools.  Nor mally in a school
 desegregation case, some one like Jean mi ght go 
into the Superintendent™s office under a court orde
r or voluntarily and st
art analyzing where the 
white students and the black students in the 
county lived and why they were not being 
assigned– say, it was pretty apparent in the 
segregated school systems that you™d have, 
especially where there wa s bussing, that black childr
en would need to pass a white school to be 

assigned to their black school.  And to put those 
patterns together and to analyze how the school 
system assigned students deliberately, so that 
white students would be
 together and black 
students would continue to be t
ogether.  Or route buses in a wa
y that ma de sure that schools 
rema ined segregated.  So they were really an
alyzing those records, which they would then 

present to the lawyers.  And th
e same thing in employme nt cases
, whether, you know, in a large 
factory, where you looked at the number of applican
ts for jobs and determi ned that a black was 
passed over, even though, let™s say that ma ybe he ha
d ma de an application to
 get to a particular 
job and the company said, ﬁ Well you weren™t qualif
ied,ﬂ in another area. 
 By looking at several 
of those situations you could 
look, you™d only know from the  
records whether the person who 
was actually put in had the qualif
ications or not, or whether th
ey passed over some one who was 
black, or they didn™t, the black
 who had applied was obviously qua
lified, or less qualified than 
the person they hired.  That kind of analysis, whic
h was then given to the lawyers.  So, that™s 
what Jean was hired to do.  And then we, later 
on when we were, she had worked there about a 
year– well, let™s see.  
It mi ght not have even been a year.  When we went to Alabama on this 
voting rights case, the Jim Clark case, Jean wa
s there with me .  She was involved in some  
records analysis.  And I almost, we were not yet 
ma rried, but I almost had 
to put her on the stand, 
but I didn™t.  And there were a c
ouple of other situations where she ended up in a place where, in 
a case that I was working on, where we began to 
suspect that John Doar 
was deliberately sending 
her to cases that I was working on, since we had 
started dating or people knew that we had sort 
of started dating.  So, after we worked on this 
case involving Jim Clark, we
 went over to, it was 
sort of a night and day affair.  She was telling yo
u that we had this unfortunate situation where 
Lois Baker, who was our secretar
y.  We hired the first probably,black secretary.   We had an 
office in Selma, Alabama.  There was a lawy
er from the Civil Rights Division, name d Chad 
Quaintance, who was the first lawyer that we had 
in a field office.  He and his family moved to 
Selma and were there.  And Chad hired Lois 
Baker as a secretary and she was an African-
American.  She was the one who ha
d these epileptic seizures.  Sh
e was just very young.  I think 
she was only about nineteen.  I went back to Selm
a for the thirtieth annive
rsary of the Selma, of 
the Voting Rights Act in 1995.  They had a big get-
together.  And it happened that I was going to 
Birmingha m for a legal services meeting and one
 of the lawyers who works in my program, 
Larry York, and I went over to Selma  for a coupl
e of days.  There was a– they have a small 
voting rights museum there.  There we re some  
people around who we visited and I visited Lois, 

who had since gotten ma rried and had two, seve
ral children.  And we were thinking back– 
She™s the head of the computer section at Montgo
mery Air Force Base or something at this point 
in time.  But after that Jean and I went over 
to Montgomery and helped work on another, on a 
school case for several days.  It was the statew
ide school desegregation case, Lee Against Macon 
County
46
.  They needed some  help.  They were just 
going to trial and they needed some help in 
getting the thing going.  And Brian, my roomma te, 
I was living at the time with a lawyer name d 
Brian Landsberg, who then subsequently ma rri
ed Jean™s roomma te, Dorothy Landsberg, who 
                                                 
46
 On Augu st 13 , 19 63 , federalju dg eFrank M. Johnsonordered Maco n Coun ty and allofAlabama to  in tegrate its 
schools, after six monthsof delib eratio n on  th e 
Lee v.Macon Co unty
 case.

was the one that John had invited to come  out.  
And Brian was my roommate
.  We livedtogether 
in a small house in Wa s hington that we had bought, th
at we had rented from a for mer lawyer in 
the Division.  Anyway after that was over, Jean 
went back to Philadelphi
a.  You asked me  how I 
me t her.  That™s how I me t her, after the skiing 
trip we started dating.  And then after working 
together so much, I think we just decided, I just
 asked her to see if sh
e didn™t think we ought to 
get married. 
 
Q: Now will you tell the st or y of how you did that?  
 You mentioned it last ni
ght, but we didn™t get it 
on tape. 
 

A: Well, I was with, actually John Doar, I think part
ially to see that I got 
home .  But to assign me , 
Jean went back to Philadelphia after the Mont
gome ry trip.  And John asked me  to go to 
Charlotte.  My classmate from law school, Ju
lius Cha mbers, who as I me ntioned was my 

African-American classmate, had gone, was prac
ticing in Charlotte, had become  a very well 
known lawyer, who was eventually, in later years 
argued the Charlotte dese
gregation case in the 
Supreme Court.  But he had starte
d a law firm and was involved in a 
lot of civil righ
ts activities, 
and there had been an attempt to bomb his house.
  I think the ma il– he hadn™t gotten hurt, it 
didn™t do a lot of damage.  But the mailbox, there 
had been some  exterior dama ge.  And we had 
started an FBI investigation and it looked like it wa
s fairly, clearly to do with the Klan.  And so 
John asked me  to go up there and lo
ok into that and ma ybe talk with
 the U.S. Attorney™s office.  
And my friend, Nick Flannery, who had done th
e Carroll County case with me , a wonderful 
lawyer, who, when he left the Division went to wo
rk for, in Boston with the Center for Law and 
Education, which was the legal se
rvices support center 
for education cases.  He was the chief 
trial lawyer in the Boston school desegregation 
case, if you– then.  But Nick went with me  to 
Charlotte and we started doing some  investigatio
n.  And we went out to eat, we were in line 
going out to eat and I said to Nic
k, I asked him to hold my place in line, that I would be back in a 
few mi nutes and I wanted to ma ke a phone call. 
 And I called Jean at her house.  I don™t know 
whether I thought  well ma ybe she 
would come  down.  It was just, my family– see Charlotte is 
only twenty miles from Gastonia.  In fact I don™t 
think, I was staying with Nick in Charlotte and 
I had not, I™m not sure I had even been home ye
t.  And I don™t know why, whether John sent me  
there so I™d have a chance to see my  folks.  
I think he thought, literally being from North 
Carolina and he knew I knew Julius, 
that I would have some  intere
st in this case, being from 
home.  So, I called her on the phone and sai
d, ﬁWill you ma rry me ? ﬂ  or, ﬁDon™t you think we 

should get ma rried, since we™ve been
 together all this time and s
eem to get along pretty well? ﬂ  
We™d actually had been, I mean we had been dating 
pretty steadily by that time.  Even had taken 
a trip or two with Dorothy and Brian.  But we
 had not really talked about taking the plunge, I 
think.  Jean would, remi nds me  that I told her, wh
en I first started going out
 with her, that when 
we started going out, that I really would not 
consider ma rrying some one who was not Jewish.  
That I had announced that early on in our dating. 
 And I must have let that one go by the board. 
 

Q: You don™t reme mber saying that? 

 

A: Oh, I don™t know whether, I™m sure I did.  I™m s u
re I did.  I™m sure it came up early.  Or once we 
started seeing each other and it became  a consid
eration, I™m sure my influence and my history 
was still pretty strong.  And I did not think I 
would ever ma rry some body who was not Jewish.  
But I did.

Q: Was that premeditated, that phone call?   It s
ounds like it was just all of
 sudden you™re waiting in 
line for food and you just felt like, I gotta go. 
 I gotta go propose ma
rriage.  (Laughing.) 
 

A: I think it was clear, I think I 
put Jean on the plane and I suppose knew that I was pretty much in 
love with her and that we ought to do that.  Why 
I did it at that partic
ular mome nt, who knows?   
Maybe it was the first free mo ment.  We were wo
rking on this Klan case and I just had a desire 
to do it.  And I knew we would go back to work 
on the Klan case, probably, and that there would 
be an opportunity for her to come  down.  That I 
would be at home .  And then she said, her dad 
suggested it.  I think I got on th
e phone with them.  I don™t know 
whether I suggested they come  
down with Jean or her father was never one to 
sit around and wait.  So, th
en I was able to tell 
Nick when I got back in line, ﬁThere™s a wedding 
in the offing.ﬂ  We  were engaged for, I think 
from Nove mber, maybe I got home, whether that 
was the engagement call.  We got married in 
February 1967.  This was probably 
like October, Nove mber of 1966.  
 

Q: And when did you meet her? 

 

A: Probably, let™s see the Selma case was earlier in
 ‚66, she came to work in ‚65.  So, she came to 
work right, probably right about th
e time of the Voting Rights Act.
  She graduated from Earlham 
in ‚65.  Because we just got a pos
tcard, she will be  having her thirty
-fifth reunion next year.  Just  
sent an e-ma il out to Dorothy La
ndsberg.  They got ma rried, we we
re the first of about four or 
five, actually.  She was living, at the time Jean 
was living in an apartm
ent with Dorothy and 
another woma n na me d Mary Lee, then Campbe ll. 
 And all three of them
 ma rried Civil Rights 
Division lawyers within a year of each other.  
And Mary Lee has spent most of her life working 
for the Children™s Defense Fund.  She™s very 
up in the hierarchy w
ith Marian Edelma n
47
.  She 
does a lot of foster care issues, 
a lot of lobbying.  She™s a terrific
 person.  And then Dorothy went 
back to law school.  Wh en they, Brian became th
e Chief of the Appeals Section of the Civil 
Rights Division, which he held for 
a number of years.  He work
ed in our Alabama Se ction, under 
me , we were living together, but 
he was in my s ection for a long, and he then became a section 
chief, I think.  And became Chief of the Appeal
s Section and stayed there until, pr obabl y ten 
years ago, when he joined the faculty at McGeorge Law School in California.
48
  And then 
Dorothy went back to law school an
d she™s a lawyer with a very large, not a very large, but with 

a fairly pr ominent law firm in Sacramento.  They live in Sacr amento.  And she™s been recently 

for the last year been doing a bi
g case with John Doar in his privat
e law firm practice.  So most 
of these connections have sort of stayed together
.  It™s a little bit like
 the Civil Rights Division, 
fairly small family.  The Assistant Attorney 
General who repl aced hi m, Steve Pollak, was a– 
Jean and I– baby, they had three kids and they 
never had taken a vacati
on since he came out of 
the Navy.  They were all small.  So, one of our first volunteer actions was to move in and they 

took a two-week vacation, and we moved in with th
eir kids and did child care for a while.  All of 
them are now ma rried or getting ma rried or having 
children and it was quite an
 experience for us.  
I think even one of the gerbils died during our
 sitting.  So, that™s 
how that happened.

Q: This is tape number six, si
de B.  You were just talking 
about proposing to Jean and the 
imme diate aftermath of t hat.  Had Jean me t your
 parents by then, by the time  that you proposed 
to her? 
 
A: I think she™d been there once, I™d have to ask 
her.  But I think she had been down once and that 
was probably a clue to them, because I didn™t bri
ng wome n by.  I™m pretty certain that she had 
been to the house once before.  So, they knew 
of her and they knew– I™m not sure how I 
managed to do that.  Wh ether it was on a vacation 
or whether we had been working on a case.  I 

just don™t reme mber, but I think they 
knew that we were pretty serious. 
 

Q: And that first meeting between her pare
nts and your parents and you– would you like to 
describe that scene? 
 

A: Well as Jean told you, she was 
there without me  with the both 
of them fa cing each other for a 
little while, so I guess they were a little bit ne
w to each other.  But her father is a pr et ty 
extroverted person, who has a lo
t of interests and was then much younger, quite young.  Wa s 
very interested in spiritual things and I think my 
dad was able to talk to him.  And they got along 
very well.  And Jean™s mother and my mother hit 
it off really well.  I think Jean™s mother had 
been a secretary and was always doi
ng transcription work of one sort
 or another.  And in fact, in 
the last fifteen years or so she would not, well 
after we were ma rried, Jean™s mother wouldn™t 
take a full time  job, she worked for Manpower
49
, so they could come  down and see Michael or 
be with the grandson and then th
e grandchildren.  We  were both, 
in the sense that  her father™s 
background was German and was the son of a tail
or immi grant family.  Hi s mother wa s very 
strong.  He grew up in New York
 City at a time when much 
of downtown New York was still 
far m, far ming country.  There are 
some  old letters in her family that I was reading when I was 
home , where they were describing 
the winter and it was cold and th
ey™d have to go outside to the 
outhouse to relieve themselves.  And they were
 literally living in a 
farming area where the 
United Nations Building is now.  But the point 
was that they were so
rt of both from old 
European generation backgrounds, where the fath
ers were working and more sort of the 
domi nant, and they were ma king the money and the mothers were at home , and the household 

was sort of run the way the fathers said it was 
run.  And in that way, I think, there was some  
commonality, even if the religions weren™t the 
same  and the fa milies got off to a pretty good 
start.  They didn™t stay very 
long on that occasion and I don™t re
me mber, I mean they saw, saw 
each other pe riodically and from time to time .  Jean
™s parents used to, as she said, came to visit 
us a lot more.  They came  down he re a lot. 
 They really took a major interest in thei r 
grandchildren.  My parents had moved to Florida a
nd did not really come  up, they ma de a trip up 
after we mo ved here from North Carolina, when they
 were still living in Ga
stonia.  As I said my 
father, ‚65, let™s say in 1966– Let™
s see, we got ma rried in ‚67.  
He retired about that time and 
they moved to Florida shortly thereafter.  So th
at we would go see them usually at Christma s.  
But they didn™t ma ke ma ny trips up.  Right after 
we moved to Prestonsburg they ma de a, they 
drove over, got as far as Pikevi
lle and the four-lane was just be
ing developed, was being blasted 
open between Pikeville and Prestonsburg.  So they 
got within thirty miles of home and then had 
to take a thirty mile detour around the back hol
lers from Whe e lwright 
and I don™t think, I think

that sort of, was enough for them
.  Although they moved to Florid
a, they never really ma de 
another big driving excursion up 
this way.  So I don™t know that 
I have ma ny more, it™s one of 
those things I don™t have a lot of
– Jean probably recalls
 better than I do.  We went back for– 
after we got ma rried and worked in the Civil 
Rights Division, when Jean then, when Michael 
was born in 1970 in April, we had decided then 
to leave the Division.  That was when the Nixon 
Admi nistration had come  in, and even though I was 
Chief of the Criminal Section, they were not, 
pretty much still let me  have a free hand.  The H
ouston school case was one of
 the last cases that 
they filed in which the governme nt, which I had 
written the pleadings in, in which we asked for 
bussing as a relief.  And they were generally to 
eliminate segregation, to 
start bussing black kids  
across to white schools and whites to
 black schools.  We  didn™t get al
l of that in the relief.  We  
did pair up some  schools and we 
made some other major improvements.  But they were, in my 
view, certainly, and others, were
 retreating on school desegregati
on.  And it wasn™t really– the 
climate was not what it had been and I, we d
ecided then, I think, that we had been there long 
enough.  Besides I had been there, was in a very 
senior position and at th
at point you™re starting 
to almost price yourself out of 
the market if you want to ma ke 
a career change.  You mi ght stay 
with the government and decide to go, to kee
p, to go up another notch or two or ma ybe ma ke 
more and more money.  Or if you™re going to a law fir m, in order to get a reasonable salary, too, 

it was at the point where it was a good time for me 
to do that.  So we, and Michael had just been 
born, it was a nice time to take off for the summe r
.  And we decided then to, we would go on a 

large camping trip.  We  got our little car and 
the baby carriage, and folded it.  We  bought a 
Peugeot for eight hundred dollars that looked like it 
had a lot of miles left 
on it.  And we headed 
North and we went North along the American and Ca
nadian coast.  We  went to the Canadian Œ 
American National Parks, Fundy and all the wa
y along, Cape Breton, out to Cape Breton and 
Prince Edward Island.  Came  back to Quebec and ba
sically got away from 
it all.  I think I had 
one call from a fir m and decided to
 leave it, not to bother with it.
  And we weren™t really sure 
where, we knew we wanted to do some thing useful
, where I felt I was using my legal talent s to 
some body™s benefit.  And I had talked to some  firm
s and that didn™t really excite me at the time, 
but I think I was just more, we were really more
 into ma king the decision to leave, which was a 
big thing, because we didn™t have a job.  But we
 wanted to get away for a while and we had 

some  money saved up, so we, while I was on that trip one of the– when we came ba ck– what 

was it?  --Some one left a me ssage for us.  One 
of my for mer colleagues from the Division, Terry 
Lenzner was the head of legal services for the 
Office of Economic Opportunity.  And he was the 
one who suggested while we were on this campin
g trip that we  mi ght want to drive through 
Charleston, West, to come  through West Virginia 
and to Kentucky.  This is by way of answering 
you about my parents, because they had moved to Fl
orida.  And we were sort of on our way to be 

at the Jewish, to spend the Jewish holidays with 
my parents in Florida, which is about this time 

of year, in September.  So we were off, I thi
nk we returned from, we wer e , went over to Cape 
Breton and we went back to Quebec.  And it wasreally cold and we bought a tent heater.  And 

then we went from there down to Boston and al
l of a sudden it was ninety-six and we were 
staying with for mer colleagues of the Civil Ri
ghts Division, who were 
in graduate school at 
Harvard, I think.  And they had this small apar
tment without an air conditioner.  We were 
burning up.  Well anyway, we started back down and 
Terry Le nzner got in touch with us and we 
went through Charleston.  And the program in Ke
ntucky was then associated with this group in 
West Virginia, called Appal
achian Research and Defense Fund, which had been founded by 
three lawyers, four lawyers, who wanted to star
t a public interest law fi
rm.  And they had begun 
some environm
ental work, but were having a to
ugh time economi cally.  And they had gotten in

touch with Te rry Lenzner at OEO and he want
ed to, was willing to do some , to fund an 
organization to do, under the auspices of legal se
rvices, to look at some  of the symptoma tic 
issues around poverty in the Centra
l Appalachian area.  Out-of-state
 mi neral interests, black lung 
disease, environmental dama ges related to co
al mining, deep mi ning and surface mi ning.  And 

Paul Kaufmann, who was one of the four, there, 
of those lawyersŠthere were four attorneys, 
Kaufma nn was a for mer gubernatorial candidate and 
was real active in De mocratic politics, had 
been a private attorney.  And John Boettner, fellow na me d Ra tliff
50
 and a woman na med Naomi 
Cohen.  And then there was a small group here in
 Eastern Ke ntucky of lawyers, who had worked 
as a group called Mountain People™
s Rights.  And there was a fe
llow name d Howar d Thorkelson, 
who was from Pennsylvania.  And he had gotten 
a couple of other lawyers to come  down here, 
although they were not yet license
d and they were having financia
l difficulties.  So the two of 
them were sort of interested in working together
 and getting this federa
l money through the We st 
Virginia organization.  West Virginia th
en had a Republican governor, Ar ch Moore
51
.  And he 
was hostile to legal services, as was the 
Republican governor in Kentucky, Louis Nunn
52
.  So 
there was a, the We st Virginia Technical Inst
itute, was an educational institution, so Te rry 
concocted a scheme  whe r eby he would fund We s t
 Virginia Tech, because educational grants 
were not subject to gubernatorial veto as the othe
r OEO grants were and then they would in turn 
fund Appalred
53
. But anyway, I guess I™m getting a little ah
ead of myself.  I wa
s just, we  were on 
this camping trip and so we came to Charlest on a
nd talked to the people there.  And Paul said, 
ﬁ Why don™t you go down to visit with the Kentuc
ky people, because Howard Thorkelson is 
going to leave and they need some one to replace
 him and we ™re going to be funding them.  I f 
you™re interested we would seriously consider 
asking you to take over this group in Kentucky.ﬂ  
So, we ca me  down here and came here to Pres
tonsburg on an August or a September evening 
and pitched out tent out there at Jenny Wiley
54
.  Back then, oh actually the campground was at 
the other end up here near Auxier
, at that entrance.  Jean wanted me  to go out and ma ke sure 
there weren™t any bears or foxes, she had hear
d– there wasn™t anybody there but us.  It was 
really after the camping season.  But we met th
e people who were here
 and everybody seemed 
very friendly and we decided to go down and– 
I had already gotten some  na me s of people, 
Harry Caudill, who you know wrote 
Night Comes to the Cumberlands
, wa s on the Appalred 
Board in We st Virginia
55
.  He was a friend of Paul Kaufma
nn™s , I think, and had been very, 
Kaufma nn had put some  people from Kentucky on his 
Board.  He wanted this thing to be more 
of a regional program because there were so ma
ny of the issues were common to the Central 

Appalachia, and that the state 
lines really didn™t mean anythi
ng.  The strip mi ning problems in 
Kentucky and We st Virginia were the same .  Un
r e gulated strip mi ning, land owners having their 
land torn up without their 
consent, and that sort of thing.  
So, I went down and talked to Harry 
Caudill.  There was a wo ma n, here on Mud Creek they were doing a lot of, they were having a 

lot of problems around health issu
es.  Hospitals we ren™t taking 
people who couldn™t pay.  Eula 
Hall was her name , she is a good friend, who still works at the, founded the Mud Creek Clinic 

here in our area
56
.  And I went over into Blackey, Ke
ntucky.  There was a fellow name d Joe

Begley, who was running a country store, w
ho was a very strong anti-strip mi ning advocate
57
.  
And his wife, Gaynell Be gley, she had gotten a Ma
ster™s in Education fro m the University of 
Chicago.  She was a wonderful person.  They– Jo
e was born here in Fl oyd County, and he was 
part Indian.  We talked a lot a
bout their history and th
e problems that he saw, poor people, and 
that people were getting run over by strip mi ne
rs.  Because Kentucky™s courts allowed mi ning 
without, strip mi ning without land 
owner approval.  Because these out of state mi neral owners 
had come  he re in the late 1890s and bought out all 
the mi nerals.  We  were talking about country 
people and being acceptance of outsiders. 
 Have you ever read Harry Caudill™s book, 
Night 
Comes to the Cumberlands
?   Yeah.  We ll you know, he describe
s this situation so well where 
these land agents for the Northern philanthropist
s, like Rockefeller and large oil holding and 
mi neral holding companies sent their agents dow
n here.  They would visit these farmers who 
lived in very remote hollers, where they were 
farming the mo untain hills, really.  And they 
would come  in and tell their stories, and spend th
e night, talk about all th
e good things that were 
going on in the world and how nice this place was.
  And then they would present them, they 
would suggest to them that they ought to go ahead
 and sell over their mi neral rights because it 
wasn™t really any benefit to them that they co
uld see.  No one knew wh
at mi ning was.  There 
wasn™t any huge deep mi ne there.  The only use th
ey ma de of t heir coal wo
uld be to cut into the 
hillside enough to get the coal to use for heati
ng up their cabins and their home s, which is what 
most of them did.  You could s
ee the outcrop of the coal and th
ey would run a scraper along the 
mountain and take out a lit
tle bit of coal.  But no one– certainly 
they were aware as they were in 
other countries of deep mi ning me th
ods.  And I™m sure these agents 
didn™t talk a great deal about 
the possibility of having a huge, deep mi ne.  This
 was in the 1890s, 1900s, was before the time  
of the railroads.  And subsequently the railro
ads came in once all these 
mi nerals had been bought 
up, I mean they literally bought up 
all of the mi neral ownership in Eastern Kentucky.  And under 
the common law, the mi neral estate is severed fr om
 the surface, so what y
ou have left is the land 
on top.  And they gave them, the deeds they 
signed as you know, were known as Broad Form 
Deeds because they were so broad in their la
nguage.  They literally gave the owner of the 
mi nerals the right to take the mi nerals and al
l steps reasonably necessary to build roads and 

railroads and tram roads.  Whatever mi ght be nece
ssary that ™s incidental  
to taking out the coal.  
And then they would sign those mi nerals away. 
 And the Kentucky courts held that those deeds 

were so broad that they gave the mi neral owner 
the paramount right to th
e surface owner, as long 
as the mi neral owner didn™t arbitrarily mi suse th
at right.  As long as he mi ned by reasonable 
me thods and took the coal out by an acceptable 
method, the surface owner could not object to 
that.  So those, Joe had one of those old deeds an
d told me  what an awful instrume nt was, that 
even though at the time when they executed th
e deeds, no one could have envisioned these 
current me thods of mi ning.  Bulldozer, mechanic
– and these huge, mechanized equipment that 
was in use seventy-five years late
r, that the courts would hold that
 to be allowable.  In most 
contract law, the contract applies to those things
 that are within the reas
onable contemplation of 
the parties, like deep mi ning.  There was no doubt
 that if you were going to mi ne back then you 
would deep mi ne to get the coal out.  We  never 
challenged that.  But th
e notion that they could 
use a me thod that was not at all in anybody™s co
ntemplation was rejected
 in other states.  
Virtually.  I me ntioned West Virginia a while ag
o, I guess that wasn™t re
ally right.  The We st 
Virginia courts had said you have to have la
ndowner consent.  You could get a surface m
i ning 
permit and you could pay for that.  And that wa
s what Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and ma ny of 
these others, Illinois, all the other 
states, courts had said, but not Kentucky.  So Joe, we talked for

a long time , was pointing out, also how poor peopl
e couldn™t get lawyers to challenge those 
deeds.  And they couldn™t get lawyers to challe
nge a permit application if someone applied for a 
permit.  But there were ma ny situations where he
 thought it would be just
 a wonderful thing if 
we could have lawyers availabl
e to represent poor people.  Be
cause he saw these situations 
comi ng up s o often.  And so, we went on, we went on to Florida to visit my mo m and dad and 

while on the way I think we kind of decided that 
this would be an intere
sting opportunity to try 
to come  to Eastern Kentucky.  It would be a wort
hwhile way to practice law and to provide that 
opportunity.  There was a lot of interesting work
 to be done and useful and perhaps important 
work to do on behalf of low-income client s.  And also to help start this legal services pr ogram, 

which was, had sort of a small beginning in mo
untain people™s rights
.  So then we came – 
decided to come , and we came.  And moved to
 Prestonsburg.  At first I looked around in 
Barbourville.  We  had a little tough time  getti
ng off the ground, because the, we had some  
disagreeme nts about how to do this the best wa
y.  Some  people, some  of the mountain people™s 
rights me mb ers thought that it was more important
 to organize, to organize work with low-
income  groups like the Welfare Rights Group, rather
 than doing lawyering work.  So it wasn™t 
quite as smooth sailing getting started as I had ho
ped.  But after a little while we got on our way 
and Joe Begley™s son, J. T. Begley, who had just
 gotten out of the Marines and gone back to law 
school, turned out to be the firs
t lawyer that I hired.  And I hired a fellow name d Mort Stamm, 
who is now in Australia, teaching.  And we starte
d off with, then a fellow name d Paul  Fauri, who 
is the Dome stic Relations Commissioner in Frank
lin County, and we started in that little house I 
pointed out to you on the way up here.  So, that™s
 how it began.  And I was telling you, it wasn™t 
an easy beginning.  I think the Ba
r Associations were very susp
icious and I think they were 
threatened and thought really we were going to co
mpete with lawyers for 
clients that would be 
able to pay.  And then some , many lawyers, w
ho were employed or retained by coal companies 
were not particularly sympathetic
 to the notion that lawyers mi ght
 start to challenge some  of 
these practices and give people representation in 
the courts.  So we were not the most popular 
people in town when we  started.  I had difficulty 
renting an office.  Finally found an office in the 
place where Jean and I ended up liv
ing for a long time on the other side of town, within a week 
of each other.  And we got started.  It was also
 a di fficult time  because at the nationa l level, 
President Nixon had an Office of Economi c Oppor
tunity Director, who was opposed to legal 
services, bringing any of these 
sort of controversial cases 
against public officials, and 
challenging welfare rights practices 
and that sort of thing.  And he
, he decided to, he wanted to 
de-fund those programs.  So I had only been here 
about a year when all of that began in 1973 and 
it looked like we mi ght lose our mo
ney.  We  had half of the lawyer
s were on half salaries and the 
secretary, we  had to hire, we got a lawyer 
in Wa s hington, Steve Pollak, I me ntioned to you, I 
used to work with, to represent us to threat
en to sue OEO to get our funding.  Some  other 
programs similarly went through a period of that so
rt.  Governor Reagan at that time , who would 

become  President, had sort of declared war on le
gal services in California, who had represented 
mi grant farm workers and had also won some  fa
irly major welfare deci sions with regard to 
hearing rights.  And had showed 
that the California welfare syst
em was violating the rights of 
welfare recipients and applicants.  And he was a
ngry and tried to start, established an inquiry, 
tribunal out in California, that 
sort of thing.  Actually the trib
unal came out with a report, this 
included some judges, that was very favorable to
 CRLA.  Then when Reagan became President, 
he decided to do it all over again.

A: California Rural Legal Assistance Program, arural program much like we are here.  But 
fortunately we ma naged to weather those storms, 
and we were able to, and in 19– we were able 
to reach an accommodation with le
gal services actuall
y, in that 1973 when we were represented 
by Steve Pollak and we sort of severed our ties
 to West Virginia by establishing a separate 
corporation here.  I mean it was–
 and they established, we adde
d ﬁof Kentuckyﬂ at the end of 
our name .  We™re still ve ry good friends with the pe
ople in West Virginia and some  of the work 
we do is the same.  But in West Virginia they
 ended up establishing a ju
dicare program, which is 
a program where cases are sent to the private ba
r, instead of a staff attorney.  And you have a 

small central office and the cases are– and then you 
contract with lawyers.  It tends to be a lot 
more expensive.  But Appalred™s office did ma inta
in intact in West Virginia, just  with a fewer 
number of lawyers.  So then we started our 
own program here.  And in 1974, one of the last 

things President Nixon did was to sign legal servi
ces Corporation Act, which he had vetoed once 

before.  And then the corporations
 started getting larger amounts 
of money from year to year.  
And between 1975 and 1978 we expanded from t he singl
e office here in Pr es
tonsburg to the ten 
offices that we opened and still have.  And we
 went from probably three hundred thousand to 
about two million dollars a year
 in our budget.  We had eleven
 offices by 1980, including we had 
a research office in Prestonsburg, I mean in Le
xington, which we still have.  So we undertook 
some  very important day-to-day 
litigation.  We  represented a lot 
of people in everyday problems 
with family law, consumer rights
, housing problems.  And we  did 
some of the larger challenges 
involved in, with regard to the coal mines.  We
 found out that the agenci
es that governed all of 
these programs were not really 
very responsive at times.  The st
ate™s Mine Safety and Health 
Admi nistration did not do a good job in protecting 
the rights of coal mi ne rs.  So we saw that 
when mi ners were fired because they complained
 about unsafe conditions.  I mean, that that™s 
what would happen to them if they c o mplained.  
And so we were able to
 start repr esenting them 
to get their jobs back and to get dama ges for 
them.  And then in the environmental area we 
represented numbers of people who were challeng
ing surface mi ning permits because they posed 
dangers to their homes and their property.  And we
 gradually, as we kept after this Br oad Form 
deed, we challenged it in the c
ourts unsuccessfully.  And we even
tually wrote legi slation that 
corrected the problem.  We drafte
d a statute that said that if 
the kinds of mi ning me thods were 
not described in the deed, that 
it would be assume d that it referre
d only to me thods that were in 
existence at the time  the deed was executed.  An
d in Eastern Kentucky or in most places that 
would mean deep mi ning only.  That was first in
troduced in 1994.  There were some  previous 
efforts, unsuccessful– there was 
an earlier statute that require
d surface owner consent and the 
courts struck that down.  And then this legisla
tion of ours was also stru
ck down on a four Œ three 
opinion.  The court said that the le
gislature could not tell the courts
 how to interpret deeds, which 
we thought was bad reasoning.  Bu
t after that a legislator fr
om Pike County, Clayton Little
58
, 
introduced at the urging of Kentuckians for 
the Commonwealth, that was then called the 
Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition–

Tape 7, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number seven, side 
A of an interview with John Rosenberg. 
 
A: I was just saying that the constitutional am
endme nt was passed in 1988, so it was introduced in 
nineteen, I guess in the 1988 legislative session. 
 And it was passed by ninety-two percent of the 
voters.  It wa s a great publicity campaign by KFTC, 
a lot of letters to the editor, it sort of put 
them on the ma p.  We ha d started KFTC with
 a small group in Hazard, Kentucky.  A group of 
citizens came together to talk 
about fair taxation of mi nerals, 
initially.  Because the coal under 
the ground, not only did the land owner not have the 
opportunity to object to
 whether they could 
be surface mining or not, but they were paying vi
rtually all the taxes on the property.  They were 

not– and the Kentucky constitution sa
id that all properties, cash– is
 taxed in fair cash value.  
But the mi nerals weren™t being taxed.  So the gr
oup looked at that and d
ecided that they would 
try to start an organization called the Kentucky Fa
ir Tax Coalition.  I™ve even been credited with 
giving, we were sitting around the 
room trying to decide what s
hould this thing be called?   
People were throwing up name s.  (Laughing.) 
 Some body said, I think it wa s, whatever the 

various combinations people had been throwi
ng out, was that I suggested it be called 
Kentuckians Fair Tax Coalition.  But the other 
issue it took on was the Broad Form Deed.  And 
the group started very small, it was just kind of 
a get together really.  One of the me mbers who, 
one of the folks who was there was a young 
ma n name d Joe Zakos, who had come  from 
Pennsylvania and was interested in working with
 local citizens groups.  
And he had come , was 
living in David, I think and had go
tten involved in some  issues over 
in Martin County.  It didn™t 
have anything to do with the Broad Form Deed.  
It was really a proposal to move a low-income  
community out of a flood-prone area.  And they we
re going to fill it in and put in new housing or 
industrial– the only thing was they forgot to di
scuss it with the people who were living there.  
And he organized an effort there to– which ulti
ma tely stopped that.  They backed off on that 
project.  But in the process began a group called the Martin County Concerned Citizens, who 

then were involved with a number 
of environmental and socially 
active, social– got involved in 
issues of social concern.  We  represented them
 one year in a case cha
llenging the application 
of– Kentucky Power wanted to build another po
wer generating plant.  And the reason they 
wanted to build it was to sell more power to other companies, but it would have raised the rates 

of everyone, including the Martin 
County citizens, people who lived 
in that area.  And we had a 
lawyer in legal services in 
Lexington, Tony Martin, who focused on energy work, and basically 
demonstrated that there was no need for the power 
plant, that all it was going to do was increase 
everybody™s power bill.  They had plenty of gene
rating power, they were 
just trying to expand 
themselves.  And the stockholders mi ght benefi
t, but the Martin County citizen group was the 
name d party.  And so that was just to say 
that, even though a group that was called Kentucky 
Fair Tax Coalition and decide
d later to rename itself Ke
ntuckians for the Commonwe a lth, 
because local chapters we re working on different
 issues of local concer n.  Didn™t necessarily 
involve mi nerals and that sort of thing.  But 
they really put themselv
es on the ma p with the 
campaign to get the constitutional amendment passe
d.  So that amendment was on the ballot in 
1988, along with the lottery.  
And the lottery barely passed.  It 
passed by, I think, fifty-one or -
two percent of the vote.  Ninety
-two percent of the vote, people
 voted for the Broad Form Deed 
amendment, which showed people knew what they 
were doing.  In fact, I reme mber when, early 
when we had been here not too ma ny years, the 
Courier-Journal
 I think did an informal poll.  
And some thing like ninety-three 
percent of the people thought they shouldn™t allow anybody to

82
strip mi ne your land without your consent.  But 
I was then, one of my, the coal industry decided 
they wanted to challenge the constitutionality of
 that constitutional amendment as violating the 
federal constitution.  Because they claimed that mi
neral ownership rights had been established by 
these series of Kentucky cases 
in the Supreme Court over the y
ears and that people when they 
bought mi neral rights expected to be able to 
legally surface mi ne.  And we argued– and I was 
representing an older couple in
 Johnson County, Garnet and Euge
ne Wa r d, who lived on a small 
far m– they really weren™t farming.  It was in a 
holler that had not been mi ned.  And there was a 
mi ning application by a company.  A
nd at the trial court,
 one of the attorney
s who was here then 
was handling, handled that case, and it was on app
eal and it came to me a
nd I took the case over.  
And we ended up arguing the constitutionality of the amendment in the Supreme Court.  And the 
Attorney General argued in our supp
ort and the court then agreed w
ith our theory that they never 
had the right in the first pl ace to grant the right to 
strip mi ne.  So it took a lo
t of years, but finally 
the right was– you cannot today surface mine anybody™s land without their consent. 
 

Q: When did that final decision come  down? 

 

A: I think it was 1990.  The Supreme Court decisi
on was stated in 1990.   Ward versus, Wa rd 
versus– I forgot the last name  for the mo ment.  
I can talk about that case a long time, but that™s 
sort of the summary.  Garnet, now both of th
e Wards– Eugene died while we were in the 
Supreme Court.  And then Garnet died a couple 
of years back.  She was a very feisty woma n.  
She claime d– they never, no one else had ever pa
id any taxes on this property.  And they didn™t 
know that anybody else had any claim to the mi ne
rals.  She thought they owned the claim.  
When we were in circuit court we
 asserted that, and there was so
me  basis for her claim, because 
when the mi nerals were sold, about 1910, really 
interesting, by– the local 
owner, the owner was 
in Johnson County and he sold th
e mi neral rights to a comp any in New York, that wa nted to 
develop these mi nerals.  And he sold– and they promised to pay him with– they gave him 
shares of stock and said they would buy those shar
es back once their comp any was in operation.  
And a year went by and nothing happened, so he 
sued them to get his money.  And actually in 
that suit some one, a deposition of him was taken.  A
nd when he sold that property he said, ﬁI will 
give you the mi nerals and you ma y mi ne that pr
operty, but I want you to leave all the walnut, 
chestnut, and heml ock trees over ten inches,ﬂ whic
h ma de it impossible to strip mi ne.  And so we 
actually ar gued initially it was not a Broad Form D
eed, that this deed specifically was limited to 
deep mi ning because it was impossible to st ri
p mi ne, because he had said that.  And on 
deposition, which was– the deposition from his te
stimony was still in the courthouse.  And in 
the deposition he reasserted that, 
that he wanted thos
e trees left alone.  
And that you could use 
the smaller timbers as people did in deep mi ne
s.  Timbers under ten inches were used for 
shorings in the deep mi ne workings.  So that
 ma de good sense.  He was saying, ﬁYou can have 
the saplings, but I want those good trees left.ﬂ  
So our local judge agreed
 with that and said, 
ﬁYou can™t mi ne.ﬂ  So they appealed to the 
Court of Appeals and they won.  The Court of 
Appeals, the intermediate appellate court said, ﬁWe
ll that™s just what these deed provisions say, 
but the mi neral owner still has the paramount right
 to mi ne under our decisions.ﬂ  So then we 
took that case to the Supreme Court on discretiona
ry review.  We asked them to review that.  
They took the case and so the amendment was argued, we argued the amendment on that.  So 

Garnet, they never, they did not
– anyway, when these mi nerals were sold, he did some , there 
was very careful, plats we re laid out and survey
ed.  And it was not, and 
when they filed this 
mi ning permit and claimed they owned the mi nerals
 where Garnet and Eugene lived, they didn™t

do that very well.  Where they claime d their 
boundaries looked like we
nt– she could ma ke, we 
could ma ke a colorable assertion th
at that didn™t coincide with thos
e original plats.  Because they 
didn™t prove that, clearly she shoul
d have had the right to those 
mi nerals, but we lost on that 
claim.  It™s just an aside, but
 I think she probably didn™t own the 
mi nerals.  It couldn™t clearly be 
shown that she owned the mi nerals.  But we won th
e case, so that™s the law.  It was a big, nice 
effort to have been involved in and I think one
 of the important achieveme nts that we ma de 
along with ma ny other cases I think the 
program™s been able to bring.   
 
Q: When you fi rst came to Prestonsburg, you and J
ean, were you planning on really settling here, 
really staying for the long haul? 
 

A: I doubt it.  I mean I think we probably thought we mi
ght be here two or three 
years.  It was a real 
big transition for her, because she wa s, had neve
r lived in a rural ar ea or  a town the size of 
Gastonia, which was 25,000 or 30,000.  She was from 
Philadelphia and had liv
ed in Washington.  
I mean she had been in Southern communities, but she wanted to– she said if– when I looked 

for a house, she wanted a sidewalk that she could roll the baby carria
ge on and be near a 
shopping area, not live out at
 David for example .   
 

Q: Is that what happened? 

 

A: Yeah.  We ll, I found a house in town that was kindof in a residential area. 
 It™s not where we live 
now.  We  moved after ten years,
 out a little ways, near a sc hool where Michael was going to 
elementary school.  The kids went to, both of them
 went to a day care center at David.  In David, 
the development of the David community was anothe
r really ma jor part of what we did in terms 

of economi c development in a small community th
at we were able to purchase for a local 
community development group.  Help the development in that town. 
 

Q: Do you want to talk about David and your involveme nt there? 

 

A: David is about nine miles from Prestonsburg an
d in the 1930s, especially
, it was a booming coal 
town.  It was what they called a model commun
ity, sort of like Wheelwr
ight, or ma ny of these 
coal, you know most– Floyd county and this areahad a number of coal camps.  The y were 

basically company towns, because a company ow
ned the homes where the people lived and the 
company pa id them with scrip.  And they owed thei
r soul to the company store, as it were.  But 

some of the homes were quite ni ce.  I mean, I think they were very nice communities and very 

close communities.  There were some  employers th
at were better than others.  And there were 
the mi ne wars in Harlan County, all of the diffi
cult history involving union
ization.  Where it was 
successful, and where it wasn™t.  But David, the 
mi ne there was the Princess Coal Co mpany.  
And David was me ntioned, was named for a fell
ow na me d David Francis, who when I came 
here, lived in Huntington.  He still, that fam
ily owned the mi nerals.  The only swimming pool in 
this area, in this end of town was at Davi
d and people used to go out there to go swimming on 
the train.  They had a little airport.  They ha
d a school.  It was a very vibrant mi ning community 
and when the mi ne closed in the ‚40s, it kind 
of went downhill.  And it was purchased by– the 

buildings, not the mi nerals, but the town of Da
vi d, the ridge around it and the homes that were 
there were, was purchased by a small group of bus
inessmen here in Prestonsburg.  And people 
paid rent to them.  And a  group 
of Catholic priests from St. Vi
ncent™s Mission came to David in 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
84
 
 
 
84
the late ‚60s and ‚70s and started teaching 
bibl e sc hool and some  literacy traini ng.  And 
apparently they were approached
 by the businessmen to see if the mi ssion was interested in 
buying the town.  I think they viewed themselves as absentee landlords and all they did was 

collect the rent.  They saw the water system
 going downhill.  They didn™t really, weren™t 
interested in developing the comm
unity.  The home s were in pret
ty bad shape.  They weren™t 
really slum lords, they just were
n™t doing anything to keep it up. 
 It was a private water system.  
So the Father, Matthew at the time, one day came to see me , and told us about the offer to buy 

the town.  They weren™t interest
ed in doing it, but they wondere
d whether we could, whether the 
community mi ght be able to buy it in some  way, 
if they, we could figure out how to, help them 
figure out how to do that.  So, I asked a law studen
t to do some  research and we got a little help 
from the National Economi c Development Law Center
59
.  And we decided, we put together an 
economic development, a corporation, a Kentucky
 corporation.  And we started having some  
community meetings in David.  And there was a 
company– the town wasn™t working, but Island 
Creek Coal Company still had a store that they 
owned.  The old company store.  Ther e was a 

fellow name d Tiller
60
, who ran the store and who also, he read the 
Wall Street Journal
.  And he 
was a very smart guy.  He was an interesting ma n.  So, they elected him as Chair of this group.  

And he became  the first Chair of our little co
mmunity development corp
oration.  We  didn™t own 
anything yet, but they st arted pl anning.  We  st
arted looking into the possibility of financing the 
purchasing of the town and how it mi ght work.  
The problem was there was no water, the water 
system was unreliable.  They had 
a pump that was literally held 
together by chicken wire.  They 
were afraid to take the gamble unl
ess they had water.  So we were 
sort of diverted for a couple of 
years until we were able to fi gure out with our 
local ar ea development distri ct  how to, ultimately 
we were able to get a grant, which helped one 
of the existing water dist ricts bring water to a 
number of their new customers in the rural pa
rt.  The Beaver-Elkhorn 
water district supplied 
water to a lot of the homes on Right and Left B
eaver Creek.  By getting them additional, those 
lines, they agreed they would 
run a line over to David, an exte
nsion.  And we established a 
David Wa ter District and went to
 the Public Service Commi ssion 
to get approval to bring water 
to David through the water district, which woul
d buy its water from this Beaver-Elkhorn Wa ter 
District that agreed to extend it
s lines.  And when we got that
 done, by that time Mr. Tiller had 
been transferred to some where, We stern Kentuc
ky.  People were afraid
 the corporation was 
going to go in, go down, because he was really sort of
 a driving force.  But there was an old coal 
mi ner, retired, who had black lung, name d Ashl
and Howard, whose nickname  was ﬁHawkﬂ.  
And he had the energy and the spirit and theŠ
even though he ma y not have had the for mal 

educationŠto push this group along.
  And he took over, became  the Chair of that group.  And 

we then, once we got the water di
strict in, we put toge
ther a financing package, where we had a 
first mortgage from the local bank here in Pr
estonsburg and a second mor t gage from a  group in 
Washington, called the Housing Assistance Council.
  And the idea was that if the corporation 
could buy the property, all of David, then the renter
s could buy their home s  in turn and the local 
bank would ma ke those mortgages.  So the bank 
would turn its money over quickly and get its 
mortgage paid back as people bought their houses
.  And the Housing Assistance Council in 
Washington helped, encourages developments of this
 sort.  They were, I think we paid them back 
twice as fast.  So, we we re able to purchase th
e town.  We had another lawyer, by that time I had 

another lawyer name d Kay Adrion, who works over in
 Virginia now as a pr
ivate practitioner.  
And she helped sort of put the deal together.  
And then after the town– we did all, this was a

large amount of legal work.  Pub
lic Se rvice Commission, all this deed work.  And we were also 
able to ge t the corporation to realize they neededto get some  staff people.  So we helped them to 
write a Vista grant to get a Vi
sta out there.  At the same  ti me  a young ma n name d Danny Greene 
had come  to David and started a, at home , he had 
taken in some foster care
 kids.  He came  down 
as a volunteer with the Mission. 
 And he started this David school, which over the years has 
obtained some  national recognition for helping hi
gh school dropouts.  He  realized there was no 
real alternative school here.  Kids
 would drop out, that was the end 
of it.  The schools really just 
wiped their hands of them.  He bought the old st
ore building.  We  bought mo
st of the town, ridge 
to ridge.  And he bought several 
others and was able to get some
 financing for the old store, 
which became  the school.  There™s now a brand ne
w building, which is very beautiful, that has 
been built in the meantime, and the story of th
e school, I™ve been on th
eir Board and we™ve done 
a lot of things together.  But 
afterwards the corporation built 
and developed about twenty-five 
new homes, Farmer™s Home owned–  put 
up new houses where the old ones were, had 
deteriorated in one of the hollers.  It™s a very
 nice, attractive town now
.  It was sort of the 
Appalachian, we had this big battle over a st
rip mi ning permit at one point.  There was a large 
block of coal left underground.  I said strip mi nin
g.  There were some  strip mi ning attempts that 
we were able to fend off.  But there was also 
a large amount of coal that had not been mi ned 
because they hit water in the mi ne.  There was an 
attempt to re-open that, to
 start, to get a permit 
to mi ne that block of coal.  And Danny and the co
mmunity got very upset about that.  And so we 
opposed that permit and there was a lot of commun
ity pressure, a lot of help.  And thankfully 
that was, we were able to fend that off.  Bu
t we™ve been very much, you™ve had deep mi ning and 
strip mi ning and coal truck 
traffic, all the problems that you see al
l over, in one little spot here in 
David.  You have the craft co-operative as a little
, as a new, which has become  fairly successful.  
It™s a nice community.  There we
re actually, we had plans to de
velop other parts of David, to 
expand it, but basically the community sort of deci
ded it didn™t want to 
get any bigger.  It™s a 
very interesting place.  And we 
learned a great deal and I think ha
d a lot to be proud of in terms 
of what the community did and the role that we
 were able to play, because they could never 
afford it, that sort of legal work, help. 
 

Q: Okay, we were just talking a little bit, off ta
pe, about how ma ny things we™d, I™d still like to 
cover about your time in Prestonsburg and worki
ng for, working with Appalred.  And that we 
probably don™t have the time to get 
into it all today.  So, I was thi
nking about, when we were just 
talking a little bit, off tape, about your time he
re in Prestonsburg, and ma ybe you can reflect on 
your work here and a little bit on just the, what 
you™ve, it turns out that you™ve devoted your life 
to.  I mean you had the opportunity of becoming a chemical salesman and you decided that 

wasn™t what you wanted to do.  And you™ve gone more
 and more in the direct
ion of service.  Any 
reflections or words on that? 
 

A: Well, I think what I™m doing now has been in 
ma ny ways has been most fulfilling over the last 
thirty years.  Working with th
e Civil Rights Division was a great 
opportunity to learn to practice 
law and to do some thing very worthwhile.  Th
e big difference is that in the Civil Rights 
Division, we didn™t live in those communities and th
at we came  and went.  Whereas, and I have 
great admi ration for the people who stayed there 
and their courage and how difficult their lives 
were.  The lives, the life we™ve ha
d for the last thirty years in Pr
estonsburg has been here.  And I 
wouldn™t at all compare myself to the African
-Ame ricans who lived in those communities and 
the life they had and how difficult that was, becau
se we are wh
ite.  And we live in an area where 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
86
 
 
 
86
there are very few African-Ame rican
s.  And I think their life has 
been difficult at times although 
it™s gotten much better.  I mean 
there is also a fair amount of bl
atant racism in this particular 
area, and some  of it is direct raci
sm.  But over the years I™ve been ab
le to recruit, at  least the only 
practicing attorney in Eastern 
Kentucky right now, is the woman who has my office in Jackson
61
.  
She™s been there a number of years.  And we™v
e tried unsuccessfully to recruit some  others, 
because they don™t– 
 
Q: You™re talking about African-Ame ricans? 

 

A: Yeah, African-Ame rican lawyers, and paralega
ls.  You have to have a support system as a 
mi nority person to live, I think, wherever you are.  
It™s difficult to be alone.  And in Hazard we 
have a church to which Cynthia from Jackson 
belongs.  And there are some  black communities 

that are concentrated in our areas.  So the fe
w people who have looked, that have really taken a 
little look at it, I think were, 
very cautious about, or were not
 convinced they could feel 
comfortable living here.  We do ha
ve a black secretary in Barbourvi
lle and one in Harlan and we 
have a paralegal in Richmond, Richmond havi
ng a fairly much larger African-American 
community.  But the population is 
about ninety-eight perc
ent white in our thirty-seven counties.  
But I think the point I wanted to ma ke was th
at we do, legal services
 offices are in the 
communities where our client s are 
and so you are much more asso
ciated and you are a part of 
that community.  I think we™re a 
lot closer to our clients and you 
get to know your clients.  And 
you get to see the problems  and live with the problems
 from day to day.  Not to say that all of us 
are poor, but I think after your kids, especially
 when your children get into the schools, you 

begin to feel that you have much more of a st
ake in trying to develop, 
do some thing about that 
community.  You find other parents who really 
want the best thing fo
r their children, even 
though it ma y be what we™re doing in court is not
 always popular.  Mayb
e our value systems are 
not on the same  track as the other lawyers who for 
a large part are driven by the money they are 
going to ma ke in private practice.  They do so
me  good things in private practice along the way, 
but generally in the social stru
cture people are driven by money.  So, I feel that the work we do, 
we represent about 7,000 client s a year and much of the work we do, whether for each of those 

client s, the case we help them on is the most im
portant thing in the worl d,
 whether you™ve got to 
talk about an abused spouse or someone who™s 
about to be evicted from an apartme nt or 
some one who we™re helping with social security 
benefits or some thing small, or whether we™re 
involved in some major issue invo
lving the Broad Form Deed or 
safety discrimi nation, the cases 
that tend to get the headlines.  Or working on 
black lung, working on trying to help ma ke black 
lung regulations more responsive, little more liberal, where more than five percent of the claims 

are appr oved.  Or some t hing like David.  Each of 
those are a real, I thi
nk, positive cont ribution to 
helping people lead better lives and ma king the so
ciety a mor e just one.
  So, I think it™s, you 
asked me  a while ago did I think we were going to 
be here thirty years when I came  and I said I 
thought we™d be here ma ybe two or three years. 
 But I think the work has been so challenging 
and the opportunity to do this work
 has been a real privilege, that
 I always say we™re fortunate at 
least to be paid for doing some thing we want to do.  And the governme nt, state and federal 

governme nts are willing to provide funds to do it.
  I think the newer, 
our younger lawyers give 
up a great deal to work for us, because they are 
working at ve ry low salaries and ma ny of them 
have large loan re-payments.  They start at 25,00
0 dollars a year and some  of them ha ve really 
huge debts of 80-90,000 dollars to th
eir law schools.  We have a small loan re-payment program 
                                                 
61
 Joh n is referrin g to  Cyn th iaEllio tt, who was th e

87
now that helps them, up to 2,000 dollars a year.  
But they™re the ones in a way who are, I think, 
ma king a substantial sacrifice to work.  I mean 
you™d hope that the government, we can do better 
than that.  That eventually we could work out
, and develop more programs that would encourage 
people to spend their lives in this
 sort of work.  But I think it™s
 been so, in part satisfying and 
challenging and all those adjectives, that I™ve enjo
yed it.  I probably, there ma y have be en times 
that Jean mi ght have wondered whether we woul
dn™t be better off going for a better educational 
system for our kids.  Michael was academically ve
ry gifted and sort of ahead of the pack.  And 
we had our difficult times, early times with–one of the teachers asked him to explain 
Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday one day, and when he, 
I think the, some  kids teased him while he 
was doing that, made it a little di ffi cult. 
 Or when he was first learning to– 
 

Q: Teased him in terms of–? 

 

A: Presenting this Jewish ceremony.  I don™t reme mber
 all the details of it, but it hurt him because 
he was doing it at their request.  And I think it was 
strange.  It was a time when they were still, 
even still doing bible–

Q:  Tape seven, side B.  Go ahead.   

 

A:  I reme mber the teacher vi rtually threatened hi
m because he couldn™t keep
 the crayons within the 
lines, which is still a problem for some  children.  I mean she was more concerned about his 

drawing, keeping the crayons in th
e lines.  And what, how that w
ould, then realizing how, what a 
negative reaction this could have on a child, 
who was basically an academically-gifted young 

boy.  But you know, those were– the teacher eventually left, and we, I think we were fortunate 

that we had some  teachers who saw how bright he  
was and that he began, that he was able to get 
the best for hims elf, was  able to do quite well
.  And we had a principal who wanted, who was 
very interested in the best, in providing good 
education for mountain kids, and who encouraged 
Jean to help start a Gifted and Talented program
 in the school.  And he never, there wasn™t a 
single swing on the yard when we fi rst came there.
  And so we put together a little committee 
and gradually got a coal company to do some
 gra ding and developed a wonderful playground 

with the PTA, on the school grounds.  And that 
he just, hi s na me  was John Pitts.  He couldn™t 
figure out where he wanted to put the swings, so
 he hadn™t put them anywhere.  But he just 
needed some help.  And you know, and I think as 
people realize that what you want is the same  
thing they want.  That what you™re trying to do is
 really not a turnover, turn everything upside 
down, that we™re filing law suits ev
ery time – but what we™re trying to do is help the community 
and be good citizens.  Then you begin to feel 
that people are on your si
de, even if the few 
lawyers aren™t, and that we have
 a lot of support in this commun
ity.  And I reme mbe r  in our PTA 
when the movement fi rst star ted to put th
e Ten Co mmandme nts up on the walls of the 
classrooms, which is some thing that™s come  back
 today again.  I don™t know if you™ve seen the 
paper, the Harlan County Board of Education vo
ted to put the Ten Commandments on the walls, 
even though it™s against the law and the Suprem
e Court has said you cannot do that.  We had a 
discussion in our PTA, a very thoughtful discussi
on.  And we had, there was, we had at least one 
fa mily of Indians, not Na tive Americans, but 
from India.  A surgeon, whose daughter was in 
Michael™s class.  And, you know, there were people
, initially the 
reaction is what™s wrong with 
the Ten Commandme nt s?   They™re perfectly 
good commandments.  And you know, I could say, 
ﬁ Well, they™re the foundation of
 our faith as Jews, but they ma y not be the foundation of our 
Indian friends, and religions differ.  And I woul
d be the last person to say there™s anything wrong 
with the Ten Commandments, but they don™t bel
ong on the wall of the school right now.ﬂ  And 
the attorney– at the time, they were waiting fo
r the Attorney General to come  out for an 
opinion.  So, the resolution at that meeting was to
 wait until the Attorney General came out with 
an opinion.  And people were quite co
mfortable with that.  I™m sure 
that if we hadn™t been there, 
and I mean the point was– that was let™s see, 
twenty years ago, that pe
ople accepted what we 
had to say, and were respectful of what we had 
to say, and were willing to wait.  And that 
wouldn™t be always the case, I 
think, where you had folks who are 
very strong in their– and I™m 
sure some  of those people are, were me mbers 
of fairly doctrinaire, Ba
ptist and– churches, but 
they were willing to say, ﬁ We™ll wait.ﬂ  And I 
think those things alwa
ys give you some  hope, I 
mean give you cause for feeling good about, being 
proud of the people you are with.  I mean I™m 
not always proud of everything everybody does, a
nd you always wonder, but–  So I think as we, 
both Jean and I, got involved in
 a lot of educational advocacy wo
rk, that we  sort of knew we 
were here.  Then when our daughter, Annie, di
d not do well academically as she got into high 
school and had a lot more– she is a very social
 person and wa s friends with people who were 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
89
 
 
 
89
very, very poor and friends with people who were 
quite rich.  And she had a lot of kids who were 
friends who were on the fringy group.  And she 
was in high school and was not doing well.  So 
anyway, she went to the David School, which didn™
t have ma ny girls at the time and they were 
able to take her.  She hadn™t dropped out.  She 
did really well there and thought the David School 
was a wonderful place because of the one on one
.  And she had a very good ma th teacher who 
helped her with her math.  We got her back 
on the right track, academi
cally.  But it was very 
hard for me  to take her– I mean I felt, I real
ly wanted to stick with the public school, public 
education.  But they were losing her, and she 
was a good example of a student who should have 
stayed, who had, at least then, aver age academic sk
ills, but was just an example of someone that  
fell between the cracks because the teachers were
 not paying attention.  Which is some thing, I 
think, we™ve changed.  And I think that we™ve alwa
ys continued to be involved in these kind of 
efforts to try to help out our schools and ma ke 
this region a better pla
ce.  And I think that 
education has a lot to do with that
.  And I think we  see in my work here in the office, we do a lot 
of work, we represent parents of
 kids who have special needs and the schools tend to, they don™t 
want to bothe r with them so often, unless you 
have  a very committed teacher, who™s going to 
work with students like that.  It™s much easier to
 move them out of the way.  So when we, I think 
a lot of the cases we™ve done, the consumer cases, all the cases I™ve made reference to, the black 

lung work, where it™s hard for, the organization 
wouldn™t have anyone to assist them in these 
very technical fields without sp
ending a great deal of mone y.  He
lping them to write regulations 
that will benefit them.  All these things have been
 really a great place for me  to work and for the 
lawyers who worked in this program.  I mean I 
think people who work in
 legal services across 
the country who devote their lives
 or their careers to servingthe poor, are a wonderful group, I 
have a lot of admi ration for them. 
 So it™s always nice for me  to come  to work every day, because 
it™s such a good place to be.   
 

Q: I wondered, you me ntioned that there is some  ra
cism in the area and you 
also talked a little 
earlier about how you had a difficult time when y
ou first arrived, because people were thinking 
of you all as Communists or some
thing like that.  And you had troubl
e renting an office and so 
forth.  Did you experience any anti-Se mitism?   Did 
people know that you were Jewish?   Has that 
been a problem at all? 
 

A: I don™t think so, ma ny pe ople in 
this area don™t know, really have
 had no experience with Jews at 
all, or  Quakers for that ma tter, I think.  And so
 in the more recent years, I don™t spend a lot of 
time at it, but I™ve been to church groups and 
talked about Judaism.  Maybe the Klan, the few 
me mbers of the Klan, when they get together, 
their constitution talks about the white, Aryan 
race, and Jews, money-ma king Jews, and that kind of
 thing.  I™ve neve r been conscious, really of 
anti-Semitism here in any ma jor way.  I know that
 those, I know that people who are strong 
Christians do feel that if you™re
 not saved, you™re going to Hell.  A
nd so they have a real concern 
about us, whom they ma y like and they don™t want us
 to go to hell.  And they would like us, I™m 
sure, to be saved.   
 

Q: Do they try to convert you? 

 

A: No, I think– Annie probably went to more chur
ch, was, went to chur ch more, because she spent 
more weekends with friends who went to chur
ch, some of whom are more evangelical than 
others.  We have been invited to many churches
.  And we have gone to, 
more to the Presbyterian 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
90
 
 
 
90
church than others because, probably the Cat
holics and the Presbyterians have run mo re 
programs for poor people.  And in this area over 
time, St. Vincent™s Mission came in here.  Or 
ma ybe not the Catholic church as
 such, but the mi nistry.  They 
brought more, while they are also 
attempting to increase the number of Catholics 
in their ranks, I think 
their message of being 
socially concerned has been str
onger than that of the other 
faiths, even though they are a 
mi nority.  The Presbyterian church 
was always very active with its
 Christian Service mi nistry.  
And it™s not as funda me ntal as the 
Baptist church and some  of their 
beliefs with respect to Jesus.  
So when Jean, as I said from the beginning wa
s working with the Meals on Wheels program and 
a number of their related programs in this Ch
ristian Service mi nistr
y, we™ve gone there ma ny 
times.  But there™s ne ver been any real, I mean 
we™ve known all of their mi nisters.  In recent  
years there™s been a much more sharing between 
rabbis and mi nisters.  No
w here, the Ministerial 
Association, they had a Catholic
 priest that was here when 
we first came, named Father– oh 
gosh, what™s his name ?   Getting a li
ttle tired.  Young Catholic priest
 was here.  It will come  to 
me  in a mo me nt.  And t hey wouldn™t let him in, w
ouldn™t let him in the Mini
st erial Association.  
He™d tend to wear moccasins around and wear blue 
jeans and was always a little bit out front on 

some  of the social issues, working with welfare 
folks, and asking people about this being the way 
Jesus would have it.  He finally, 
I think, five or six years later, 
put a Christma s card in the paper, 
wishing all of his mi nisters we
ll at Christmas, hoping they would have a nice Christmas.  He 
guilt-tripped them into it.  They finally let him 
in.  But there wa s that kind of thing, but there™s 
never really been, I don™t know, people have always
 been very nice to us maybe because, more 
about who we are than what the religion is.  
I™m sure they would welcome our, ma ny of the 
churches would have welcomed the conversions
.  Or the fundame ntal 
religion, especially.  
We™ve been to ma ny funerals, I mean, when you get 
to these, especially 
when you go to a funeral 
where they preach over, about salvation and 
that you simply, you know, you™re doomed if you™re 
not saved.  And they™re looking at 
you.  (Laughing.)  But they mean well.  I mean that™s what it 
is, they feel  like we™r e going to 
be lost if this doesn™t happen. 
 

Q: Would you just talk a little bit 
about your and Jean™s practice as fa
r as faith, religion?   You go to 
synagogue once a month?   You go to 
a Quaker meeting once a month?  
 

A: Yeah, well we, while the kids were, we sort of
 maintain the Jewish tradition, Friday nights, 
Saturday, not every Friday night, but especially
 when everybody is together.  And we go to 
services now more regularly since we go to Willi
amson We st Virginia, for the Jewish services.  

They are on Sunday night, as I me ntioned.  It™s 
a rabbi comes down from Huntington, so he has a 
Friday night service on a Sunday night.  The Qu
akers meet monthly in some body™s home.  And 
of course you can have a Quaker me e ting whet
her you have three peop
le or three thousand, 
because they are silent  meetings for worship. 
 And people get up and say some thing during the 

silence, if they are le
d to say some thing.  And it ma y go on fo
r half an hour, it ma y go the whole 
hour and nobody says anything.  Or it ma ybe that 
some one has a comme nt that is on their mi nd 
and ma ny pe ople speak.  In the more organized 
communities in the East , you have this group of 

overseers.  I mean the me eting has to have an
 administration with dues and Sunday school and 

all of that.  But this is a very informal gr
oup.  There is an annual me eting of Quakers in 
Kentucky which we haven™t been to in a while.  
But the participants here are generally a couple 
in Hazard and a woma n who teaches at the Pi ne
 Mountain Settlem
ent School and a woman who 
is a doctor in Hyden, who is in her seventies and 
has been there for maybe twenty-five or thirty 
years, I guess, who™s a teacher.  But he was a 
doctor and she™s a Quaker, 
very interesting person, 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
91
 
 
 
91
who lives up a holler in Hyden in a small house 
with– all these hundreds of
 goldfinches that are 
usually there.  A very nice loca
tion.  And then there have been 
some  Mennonite volunteers, who 
have come  to Quaker meeting during their volunt
eer period.  So the group 
is a little bit fluid, 
although there is this pe rmanent group, if you will.
  The couple in Hazard work for the rural 
health system and they™ve been there for severa
l years.  So they meet once a month and they 
were in Prestonsburg a fe w weeks ago.  The next 
time will be in Hazard or at the Pi ne Mountain 
Settlement School.  That woma n is in her seventies, also. 
 
Q: And do you always go to the Quaker meetings, too? 

 

A: And I always go.  I™m a very big fan of Quakeris
m.  I mean I would not, not to convert.  It is a 
very tolerant religion, built on faith, and the light 
that shines on everyone.  And I don™t know that 
there™s a gr eat enormous amount of difference, ex
cept that it™s built on the teachings of Jesus, 
essentially.  But they don™t dwell 
on salvation and the othe
r parts of it.  I think they really dwell 
on living your life out in 
a full life and serving others, and the pr
inciples of huma nity that I share 
and that I feel good about.  So I think it™s been 
pr etty easy for us to adapt to each ot her.  I™ve 

probably spent more time now with the Quaker part 
of it.  I really haven™t studied Quakerism that 
carefully.  I™ve read a lot of 
books and probably will some time, as I should read about Judaism.  
And I haven™t done as much of that also, a little here
 and a little there.  But 
I™d like to that a little 
bit more.  I™ve got plenty of other things 
I also want to read. 
 Right?   Like you do.   
 

Q: And how did you raise your kids?   We
re they involved in both religions? 
 

A: They were involved in both, although as I sai
d, Michael, we didn™t have Quaker me e tings back 
then.  We  ha d some  of the state gatherings.  Th
is group is a relatively 
recent phenome non of the 
last three or four years.  
It was really sparked by the pe
ople in Hazard.  And we didn™t go 
initially.  We were when Michael, I guess in our ea
rlier years, we pretty mu
ch went to services in 
Ashland and took Michael when he 
was little, and Annie.  They we
re the only children their age 
at that time .  And we would go fa
irly regularly, but we always we
nt during the Jewish holidays.  
And the Quaker tradition doesn™t have a lot of
 formal ceremony with it as Judaism does around 
these holidays.  So we would celebrate those 
and we would go to Passover.  We  had Passover 
Seders at our house, which Jean and ma ybe th
e others would, she did the cooking and became 
fairly well-versed in what™s involved.  Di
d some  r eading and embarrassingly probably knows 
more about some  of those traditi
ons now than I do.  But that™s th
e way the kids were raised.  And 
Michael, as I told you, I spent 
more time with Michael probably 
talking about, doing sort of a 
light Sunday school lesson every Sunday for several years.  That was part
 of our tradition at 
home .  I didn™t do that with Ann Louise for,
 I™m not sure exactly why.  I think– who knows 
why?  But I didn™t.  More recently she has beco
me  much more interest ed in both.  I think she 

was, as Jean was relating to you, very concerned 
about the Nazis, the history, the danger that it 
posed and still is worried about some  goofy Klansperson comi ng to the house and doing 

some thing. 
 

Q: To you in particular? 

 

A: Yeah.  She has become , both of the ki ds will be  ho me  for the Jewish holidays, I think.  I don™t 
know about Annie, for sure, because she works on Saturdays.  But neither of them– a nd 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
92
 
 
 
92
Michael will be home.  Rosh Hashanah falls 
on a weekend.  I don™t know if he will come  on 
Yom Kippur .  Now some one would say, ﬁHow c ould you work on Yom Kippur? ﬂ   And he mi ght 
or mi ght not.  But those are their lines to dr
aw.  I mean it would have been unthinkable for 

anybody to work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur
 when I was growing up.  And so they still 
have to find their own, figure out, I guess, what th
ey want to do in terms of their religious– or 
how religious they™re going to be.  Either wa
y, either way, I think t
hough Annie™s now becomi ng 
a little more interested. 
 Although she hasn™t been going to th
e synagogue in Louisville.  She and 
I went to a Unitarian service t
ogether in Lexington a couple of
 years ago.  But we feel okay 
about it. 
 

Q: Do you want to say some thing in closing now? 

 

A: Like a prayer?   (Laughing.) 

 

Q: Would you lead us in a prayer? 

 

A: No, I can™t imagine anybody listening to all these 
tapes.  I was saying to Jean, ﬁMaybe–ﬂ  She 
said, ﬁWell, can I listen to them? ﬂ   And I said, 
ﬁWell, you wouldn™t want to 
listen to all this.ﬂ  I 
said, ﬁWell, ma ybe some body wants to listen to th
is history years from 
now or maybe the kids 
would want to look in some  archive, right?ﬂ  No, 
it was nice of you to be interested to do it, to 
listen to it.  And I™m sur e  we still haven™t covere
d a lot of ground.  But it would be true if I did 
one of you, even though you probably wouldn™t think 
so, but we all could spend a lot of time.  
I™ve just been fortunate, probably to
 have had such an interesting 
career  in these two legal jobs, 
with the Division and with legal services.  And now 
that I™m also interested in the Science Center  
and other community activit
ies that we™ve been involved in.  Just
 have a lot of interests that I™d 
like to pursue, that happen to be, 
I think, in areas that can affectother people and help them in a 
positive way, besides me.  And I like to do it, so 
I think that™s been a real reward.  And you can 
come  back in thirty years, and ma ybe when 
I hit a hundred, I™ll reflec
t on the last forty. 
 

Q: Yeah, that™s a good idea.  Okay, I™ll s
ee you in thirty years.  Well, thank you.

Tape 8, Side A 
 
Q: Okay, it™s May 27
th
, 2000 and we™re several months later,
 picking up on our interview with John 
Rosenberg and so this is actua
lly tape eight, side A.   
 
A: Tapeeight? 

 

Q: Yeah.  So, going back, we were just talking a li
ttle bit off tape about some  of your, about some  of 
your speaking experiences and th
ings that you™ve brought up or drawn upon when you™ve gone 
to commenc e me nt addresses and so forth.  And one 
of the things that you me ntioned was the last 

case that you had before you left
 the Justice Departme nt which 
had to do with the Kent State 
University violence.  Can you talk about your role
 in that and your point of view about what 
happened?  
 

A: Well, I mean my role was, at the time was as Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights 
Division.  Because this involved the National Guar
d and potentially othe r police officials, state 
offi cials, the Justice Department is called in to investigate.  Potentially there is a federal crime 

when police officials act illegally or summar
ily and what we call summary punishme nt by not 
arresting, for example, students who do some thi
ng wrong, but rather they overreact and shoot or 
punish or beat whoever the victim mi ght be.  So, 
when this happened, this incident happened and 
was called to our attention, my job was to write a 
request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
to investigate, to see whether 
a violation of federal law had o
ccurred.  And so, that being May 
ofŠhow ma ny years ago? Š1970, thirty years ago, I dr
afted that request, which then was sent 
out under the name  of the Assist
ant Attorney General 
of the Civil Rights Division, who I believe 
at the time was Jerry Leonard.  And I™m sure I™d 
have to go dig it out or 
I don™t even know if I 
have a copy of it, you know, it would be fairly 
thorough about where they 
would be interviewing 
any witnesses who were there and whether they, th
e police officials in fact were threatened or 
there was any reason that 
would justify their having used fo
rce in shooting those students who 
were killed.  There was a long 
grand jury convened after I left
.  As I recall it was actually 
inconclusive.  I think ther e was no federal trial.  
I think there were civil trials later which I™m not 
sure, it seemed to me  they ma y have recovered 
some  da ma ges  for the fami lies of the children, of 
the students who had been killed.  
It was just a very tragic event. 
 There were others at the time.  
I recall, I think when we were speaking, I had 
seen an article recently before I gave  the 
commence ment address here at Prestonsburg Comm
unity College, which happened to have been 
written by the President of Kent State University. 
 It was sort of a me mor i al column or just 
recalling those tragic events and the fact that 
they were in the me mory of t he President and 
people who were at Kent State now.  And that th
e school itself had ma de great progress in the 

intervening years and th
at this awful event was a milestone
, obviously, in the history of the 
school, which sort of ma rred its reputation, along w
ith– or which they felt ma rred its reputation.  
It was not forgotten, but 
that since then the school had progre
ssed and had moved into the age of 
technology and that she was very 
proud of their progress.  And I happened to be particularly 
moved by the way that she ended the column, whic
h was that in this age of technology, it was 
important not to lose our humanity.  And so I 
was, used her, some  of her quotations in 
concluding this address that I gave to the local st
udents.  And it remi nded me  that it was also sort 
of one of the last things we 
did, that I did at the Justice De
partme nt, before we left on our 
vacation, but really left.  And th
en were headed for Appalachia.

Q: So you just filed the case, 
but you didn™t investigate it? 
 

A: Well, I didn™t, no.  My job basically, if– had I stayed, the office, the lawyers who worked with 
me  and for me  as Chief of the Crimi nal Section– 
after, the way those thi
ngs would work is that 
when the FBI goes through its investigation and pr
epares a report, those are usually turned over 
to the United States Attorney for prosecution or
 for determination of whether a crime has been 
committed.  And generally then if ther e is some  conflict, in other words when the offi cers say, ﬁI  

thought that it looked like 
the student had a gun and that we had 
to shoot the student or we would 
have been killed,ﬂ those factua
l disputes, some one has to resolve them by generally going to a 
grand jury, which is what happened.  And then 
either  the U.S. Attorney co-operatively with 

lawyers from the Civil Rights Di
vision, or– would ma ke that pres
entation, but we left.  That 
was at the point after I had author
ed and drafted this report, this 
request, wa s when we left.  And 
so the investigation really went on and I believe 
one of my c olleagues, Jim Turner, who was sort 
of one notch up in the hierarc
hy as a Deputy Attorney General
62
, was sent out there and that he 
spent several months, along with reviewing the repor
ts and working with the grand jury and then 
determining whether some one should be indicted or
 not.  I want to think 
that there was never, 
that there we re no federal indictme nts, but I ma y 
be wrong.  It seems to me that was one of the 
sad things, that this was one of 
those, one of those sort of inc
onclusive– there were, on the face 
of it you would think that there was no reason to 
shoot students, because they were certainly not 
arme d.  And that they got caught in the, were vi
ctims of what happened.  But I™m not sure that 
anyone was actually ever accused of having, of criminally havi ng done this.  That there was 

some evidence in the heat of the mo ment that 
these folks felt threat ened, their lives were 

threatened.  And that they, while they ma y have 
been negligent or they may have, whatever they 
did, that there was enough justification to ma ke 
them question, that they made a bad decision, 
but it wasn™t, certainly wa sn™t intentional on thei
r part.  And that it ma y have been enough to 
warrant civil proceedings.  But that™s the way 
those things alwa ys, you know, went.  And so in 

other circumstances, like when I was in the Houst
on case, we also asked the FBI to investigate 
and to assist us in determining, looking at record
s and other areas.  And then the lawyer who is 
responsible for the case, as I was in the Houst
on case with other lawyers working with me  and 
were working under my direction, th
en I would present the case to the judge.  That™s how those 
things work.  We ™re done.  I didn™t do any more in Ke
nt State.  I mean that was, most of that then 

happened after I left.  So it was a me mory and this
 article that I happened to see in the newspaper 
sort of jogged my mi nd back.  It™s
 sort of the punctuation ma rk.  It
™s the point at which we left. 
 

Q: I wonder also if you had, at the time if you felt, 
you had me nt ioned in the ear
lier sessions of this 
interview how much you idealized 
this country and its constitution 
and the principles on which it  
was founded, and that you really held, had high expectations of it.  During the Vietnam Wa r did 

you feel disillusioned with this 
country and its governme nt?   Or 
did that change your perspective 
at all?   
 

A: Well, I mean, I think there are lots of times 
when you wish political decisions were ma de, were 
different.  I mean I think that ev
eryone is, that a lot of people 
are sad about our involvement in 
the Vietnam Wa r.  I was in the war, served durin
g the time  of Korea.  It wa s obviously– and as I 
probably said before, there were 
lots of reasons I enjoyed the tim
e I spent in the Service.  We

ma de a lot of very close friends, who I continue
 to see and hear from, and get together with 
periodically.  And I think you feel that you are 
doing some thing worthwhile when you™re in the 
Service.  And helping this count
ry in a small way.  But that I 
also noted that when, during the 
Suez Canal Crisis, when we were on alert for a w
eek and no one was quite certain which side we 
were on, and that because the United States hadn
™t ma de up its mi nd which side we were on, and 
Israel was one of the partners, was one of the ma
in parties involved in th
at dispute, the thought 
that we would be in a conflict w
ith Israel was not very appealing 
to me, but that  it just let me 
know how much of a, that this was not what I wa nt
ed to do (laughing), to be regime nted in that 
way.  So that staying in the Service was not a
nything that I wa nted to do.  On the other hand, I 
always, I think that it™s a very 
dangerous occupation.  And I feel
 those people who are in the 
Military for a career, who really believe that this
 is an important thing to
 do, often that we owe a 
lot to people who have been, who have served in
 our Military, and who ha
ve either given their 
lives or come back wounded or who are veterans .  And I™m sure now we much, recognize much 
more the people in Vietnam, who 
may not have won a war, were 
nevertheless there because they 
were doing what they were told to do.  And 
of c ourse a lot of people were willing, were 

Conscientious Objectors and didn™t go.  My pers
onal feeling is if some one ™s a Conscientious 
Objector they ought not to go.  A
nd we ought to let them not go.  
There are plenty of people who 
want to go or  who were willing to go or there were
 and there were things that coul d be  done.  So, 
I don™t know that I, I™m not disillusioned.  I™m still 
ve ry much a, feel very strongly that, I guess 

ma ybe it™s a little rhetoric, but I f
eel that this is still the best 
country in ma ny, ma ny wa ys in the 
world.  There are a lot of imperfections with it, th
at we– and some  of the issues that we  have to 
resolve are very difficult issues.  When we see in
 this area the economy be ing as poor as it is.  
We™ve lost a lot of jobs here.  Trying to catch 
up.  What I spoke about at
 PCC, of course, that, 

that the Kent State thing relate
d to, I asked, I emphasized to th
e students how much they should 
be grateful for being in this free country.  It was 
also the, the week of the graduation was also the 
week of Law Day, in which we celebrate our fr
eedom and the Constitution under which we live.  
And it was also the anniversary of Holocaust 
Remembrance Day.  And it was the anniversary, 
the thirty year anniversary of Kent State.  And 
I think all of those are me
ssages that we need to 
reme mber and reflect upon.  I think we do have a 
legal system that really
 is the basis for the 
freedom that we have.  And a lot of those fr
eedoms are at time s tenuous.  You worry when the 
Klan, you wish we did not have the Klan around, but
 the fact that we allow them to e xist under, 
in a restricted way still is part of the fr eedom th
at we can enjoy.  And I think all of those kinds of 
issues sort of tumble around together.  And yetwe, we have to be, we™re
 always balancing those 
things.  And I think the political system that we
™re under, where we flip 
back and forth between a 
De mocratic party in control and the Republican
 party in control at 
the state and national 
governme nt, kind of keeps everybody off balance, at 
the state level and the fe
deral level.  But it 
seems to ma ke us sort of come  out in the mi ddle and even though lots of things go on that we 

don™t like.  I mean I wish we had greater funding for 
legal services at the st
ate and federal level.  
And some times Congress, the legislation we ha
ve on, that affects welf
are moms see ms very 
punitive, at time s.  And I  know we could do better w
ith that.  We clearly need a better health care 
system, there are lots of places 
where we can improve, where we ought to improve, being as rich 
as this country is.  We  seem not to regard peopl
e, the problems poor people have as seriously as 
we ought to.  We
ll, that™s a rambling answer.  I 
can™t even reme mber, it s
eemed to me  that we 
started with Kent State and we 
kind of got into what I was talk
ing about, but it all kind of goes 
together.

Q: Yeah.  Kind of related to what you were 
saying, can you talk more, you had me ntioned that 
some ti me s, you me ntioned off tape and I™d like to
 get this on tape, that
 you me ntioned when you 
go to speak at various places within the communit
y, people are interest ed in, partially interest ed 
in hearing you speak because of your Holocaust-r
elated experiences.  And ma ybe you can talk 
about your, your invitation to speak 
at the hundred-year anniversary of one of the black churches 
here and also talk about why you th
ink it is that people want to hear
 about that par
ticular aspect. 
 
A: Well, I think that the black 
church, the name  right now escapes me , probably shouldn™t.  The 
hundredth anniversary was an event they™d wo
rked on, was quite a significant event for the 
church.  There are two churches in Wheelwright , 
Kentucky and this is one of them.  And they 
had been planning this anniversary for some  time 
and have had a series of mi nisters over the 
years and it™s a very cohesive community.  And 
I think, probably, one of the reasons they asked 
me  to speak was because they related, they knew 
that I was Jewish and that I had been involved 
as a legal services lawyer and perhaps as a Justic
e Departme nt lawyer in some  civil rights issues 
over time .  But also that I was 
a, that my family had escaped 
from the Holocaust and they knew 
some  of that history.  And I think they analogized
 it in their own way to the discri mi nation that 
they had felt and that they wanted me  ma ybe to
 reflect upon the f act that there were people who 
were white and who were discrimi nated against b
ecause they were Jewish or for reasons other 
than race.  But that  some one, a fami ly lived in 
this community that had shared some  of that 
history that their own families and ancestors had 
experienced over their lifetime.  I know that, I 
think in the schools, I think that
 the schools now have ma de the Holocaust a very much a part of 
their curriculum.  When I go, 
I™ve spoken to mi ddle school stude
nts and elementary school and 
high school students.  And when I ask how ma ny
 of them know who Ann Frank was or whether 
they have done a unit on Ann Frank, almost every 
hand goes up in the room.  I think that unit is 
probably done in the fifth and sixt
h grade and in the seventh grade. 
 And that, but th
e fact, I think 
teachers tell me , the fact that they see some one 
who is alive and who can come  into their class 
and say this is what happened to my family.  I 
was eight years old when they arrested my father 
and took him to the concentration camp.  Or I 
was standing in the courtyard when they were 
dynamiting the synagogue.  That is always more, it makes a stronger point than having heard it 
from a third person.  And if it™s someone in 
their own community th
at I suppose has been 
identified as having some credibility, that doesn
™t just ma ke these stories up.  I think when you, 
you always tend to put some  faith and trust in pe
ople that have lived with you a long time, who 
are part of the community.  It™s 
kind of like any other,
 listening to older, some one de scribed the 
history of the May house or the May fa mily or th
eir own fami ly history.  When they™ve grown up 
here it means more.  At least I think that™s, wh
enever you find some one, whether it™s the war, my 
neighbor used to, my ne ighbor must have been on
 every beach.  He died a few years ago, but he 
was one of those Appalachian soldiers who was drafted and lived 
through every beach assault in 
the Pacific.  And even if he tells it in a low ke
y sort of conversational wa
y, it™s very powerful to 
talk to some one who lived it. 
 

Q: It™sinteresting,considering 
your significant experience, you sp
ent a lot of time worki ng on civil 
rights and a lot of time here in 
Appalachia working on 
helping the poor with legal services.  And 
it™s interest ing that the thing that
 people would pick out when they
 want to hear some thing from 
you, is this thing that really happened in your dist
ant past and really has to do with your roots, 
which hasn™t been so much the focus of your ve
ry significant work and interesting work.  Do you 

think, I™m trying to– there™s kind of a questi
on in there some where, but I think, you know, 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
97
 
 
 
97
there™s some  key ma ybe to your roots which cam
e  up in the earlier interviews, too.  That you 
me ntioned that where you come  from and your escape from the Nazis has been a very important 
part of the work that you have subsequently done
.  Or that it™s some thi
ng that you™ve kept in 
mi nd, but we didn™t really go into very much deta
il about that.  Has it been– is that some thing 
that  you really think about a 
lot, about the Holocaust era and about your family and about– 
maybe can you just talk
 more about that?    
 

A: I don™t know that it™s with me  every day.  I thin
k that– and I think I™ve s
poken about this before.  
Well, before I forget it, I think in my earlier, 
when I  talked about comme ncement talks or just 
generally about legal services, I 
really did not speak, talk mu ch about the Holocaust unless I was, 
unless– I mean some  of the church groups, when
 we first came  Jean was – we were involved 
with the Presbyterian church a good 
bit because they did a lot of social, were more involved in 
local social projects.  They started Meals on Wh
eels and Christian Service Minist ry that she was 
involved with.  And so the mi nisters who knew th
at we were involved, ha
d Passovers and that I 
was Jewish and some  of that developed into, pe
ople, by word of mouth realized that I wasn™t 

born in this country and that I did have this e
xperience.  But it wasn™t, I guess in more recent 
years, I™ve had more, probably as people learne
d and as I spoke more about the Holocaust and 

about being Jewish, that there have
 been more, there™s been a bit 
more of an awar
eness about the 
Holocaust.  I think pa rtly because of the Holo
caust Memorial and there™s been more publicity 
generally about the importance of
 this whole era and trying to 
make people reme mber it and not 
let it be forgotten.  That all proba
bly is part of the reason why this
 has come up.  And I think that 
tying it into Law Day is some thing that ha
s gotten around among the teachers, that that™s 
some thing I™m willing to speak about or can 
speak about on La w Day, that ma y be more 
meaningful to students than just talking about 
the Constitution or how the legal system works, 

which is the other thing that we generally do wh
en we go to the schools.  Well, I don™t have any 

doubt that the history, that our fleeing from 
Ger many and comi ng to this country and being 
grateful for the opportunity to be free here, has 
sort of moved me  into public service work.  I 
think that™s pretty clear.  When I was in the m
ilitar y, I think it probably in a way helped move me 
to go to the Service as well.  
I don™t know that I went into the 
ROTC, which helped partly also 
with tuition.  Back then it was one of the ways of ma king Duke affordable, which was an 

expensive school.  But I mean, whether it™s ju
st the rationalization or
 the reason, I think I 
certainly felt that being in the Service was one wa
y of trying to help fulfill my, help me give 
some thing back.  You can stay out of the Service. 
 I™m sure I didn™t have to do that.  But that was 
during a time that people also were
 being drafted.  And that if 
you didn™t wa nt to be an enlisted 
ma n and wanted to do more with your career in
 the Service– I guess 
my bigger decision was 
that I was, I did have the option 
after comi ng out of Duke as a chemistry ma jor, of going to work 
in the Mi litary as being in some thing that was 
more science-related back
 then, working, using 
my che mistry degree.  And I decided really not
 to do– I decided I was 
either going to fly and 
then ultimately became a navigator.  Because the p
ilot training didn™t really work out.  But I, so 
I™m sure that was probably, sort of an adventur
esome kind of t hing to 
do.  It would be more 
interesting than being in a lab.  
I knew that I probably mi ght want
 to sell chemicals some day.  I 
really hadn™t decided my long-term career goals
.  But I flirted around when I came out of the 
Service and went back to Rohm and Haas as a 
technical representative fo
r a chemical company.  
I don™t know whether we– did we talk about that?    
 

Q: Yeah. 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
98
 
 
 
98
 
A: So, I flirted around for a little bit at one point about going to 
Rabbinical school and decided not 
to do that.  But I™m sure that what, that going in
to the civil rights work 
and being, and wanting to 
do public service work has been to some  extent influenced by, and ma ybe a large extent, 

probably a lot of it is subconscious, 
the fact that I want to feel  th
at the contribution I can ma ke in 
helping other people in this count
ry, who are not as well off, is 
just a way of helping to give 
back.  I don™t know that it™s any sort
 of sacrifice.  I just feel like 
there are lots of ways to spend 
your life.  And if some  people want to spend it pr
acticing law in one way or another, that™s their 
choice.  But it™s a much more, this
 is part of it, but I don™t feel
 that I had any obligation to do 
this.  I just, I™m sure that havi
ng that history in our fa mily in 
a ma jor way influenced us, as well 
as– I mean, my father and mo m, my
 father worked in the textile plant.  He was a teacher.  My 
brother is in public service, work
ed for the governme nt all of his lif
e.  My sister was an architect 
working for the state on issues affecting handicap
ped people, an architect
ural barriers person.  
So, and just recently finished law school, and is 
now thinking about how to use the law degree in 
a helpful, probably together– I don™t know that sh
e will be going into legal services, but I– I 
mean I don™t know that my motivations are reall
y, I think all of the lawyers and people who do 
public service work, whether our 
daughter, who is in social– work
ing on a social work degree, 
and working with developmentally-disabled people
 now in Louisville.  Or our son who works 
with students who have academic difficulties.  Or
 your or whoever the other people, who are in 

public service life, who choose to ma ke that their 
life and feel that servic
e is a way to live out 
your life in a meaningful way–

Tape 8, Side B 
 
Q: All right, this is tape eight, side B.  And 
uh, related to your work or 
to your experiences with 
speaking to groups, you had me ntioned a little bit 
earlier that you have on 
Law Day talked about 
the Holocaust.  And what do you talk about when you talk about the Holocaust on Law Day? 
 
A: Well, I talk about the contrast
 between a society that we have 
in this country, where we  have a 
governme nt and a nation, which is governed by the rule of law and what happened in Fa scist 

Germany where the legal system was basically put as
ide for a dictatorship.  
And that the kinds of 
things that were able to happen in the Holocaust , which was a result of Hitler™s fanaticism.  And 

what did happen in that dictat
orship, and how, again, grateful 
we need to be and how they, 
students, can reflect on or ought to
 reflect, and their teachers and 
all of this ought to reflect on 
the system we have in this country, whichwould not, hopefully, permit 
anything like that to 
happen.  That the checks and bala
nces in the legislative, executive and judicial syst ems would 
keep that from happening.  And that we have, that
 free speech is important
 and that all of the 
guarantees that we have under the Constitution a
nd under the Bill of Rights are ve ry meaningful 
and that it™s important to talk about them.  So
 I use, I guess the fa mily™s personal experiences, 
and I talk a little bit about the 
hi stor y of how all this came about in the 1930s from Hitler™s rise 
to power.  How during the war, I mean even af
terwards, how people would like to pretend in 
Germany that no one knew about it and this all 
sort of just happened and people are looking the 
other way.  At least were looki
ng the other way and most, I susp
ect, did know about what was 
going on in the Death camps.  That™s what I tr
y to focus on and I think the teachers seem to 
appreciate that and seem to feel that it™s a good 
way to have their student
s appreciate Law Day.   
 

Q: Why don™t you just talk about– you had me ntione
d in the first sessions that we did, some thing 
about the relationship between Judaism and justi
ce, and it was some thing that you said that you 
had thought about.  Would you 
elaborate on that some ?  
 

A: Well, I don™t reme mber what I said at the time, 
but the impor tant tenet, I guess, of Judaism is the 
emphasis on justice, study and justice.  That 
the Ten Commandments and having a society where 
being just to each other and where you have a gov
erning, legal codes that govern Judaism, which 
are principles of living really.  The ma jor ones.  
I mi ght have said that 
those principles probably 
helped to influence me  and the work that I do.  
I reme mber when we were just talking about Law 
Day, usually when I begin a talk, I 
talk a little bit about 
the fact that we™ve been, who we are and 
who I am, that I™m here in Prestonsburg.  We ™ve 
lived in Floyd County all 
these years.  And talk 
a little about our legal services 
agency and try to describe that
 we do have a system in this 
country that provides lawyers fo
r people who can™t afford lawyer
s, on the criminal and on the 
civil side.  And that what this program, what 
Appalred and other civil 
legal services programs do 
and how difficult it is.  Many times it is basically
 impossible to navigate through the legal system 
without having a lawyer to help you, so that poo
r people are often on the short end of business 
transactions and ma ny ot her people 
lose rights.  They lose benef
its to which they ar e entitled.  
And the kind of work that defenses in eviction ca
ses, consumer cases, all the work that we have 
done.  The Broad Form, environmental work.  So I 
try to also me ntion that.  So, going back to 
what you were asking me , I don™t know that it™s 
any easier– I mean I think all religions, 
whether it™s Christianity with Je
sus™ sort of different, some wha t  
little different spin on the loving 
aspect of God, that it™s not as much of the retr
ibution and thunder that you read about in the Old 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
100
 
 
 
100
Testament.  But that any, I know there are a lot of
 people in legal services  and folks have written 
about, who, even who have had backgrounds in Divi
nity School, or who feel that by helping, by 
using their legal talents to help people who 
are oppressed or who ar
e poor or have been 
discrimi nated in one way or anothe
r, that that is a good way for th
em to live out their life and 
their principles and their valu
es.  And providing legal services
 for low income  people, I don™t 
think that that™s– there™
s anything particularly unique about 
being Jewish in that way.  I just, 
probably anyone who fe els that their,
 that religion and a belief in 
God is part of their personality 
or their person, would feel the same  way about th
at, I think.  I mean, we have people in legal 
services who are very religious
.  They™re Catholic, Protestant
, Jewish.  And we have ma ny 
people who are not religious, just as, I™m sure, other professions do. 
 
Q: The question that had come  to my mi nd before
, that had slipped out, 
was kind of related to 
some thing that, when I™ve interviewe d other Holocau
st survivors, that gets brought up a lot.  And 
I don™t know whether you™ll have anything to say to it
 or not.  But often I hear people say that 
they feel, hear people state an opinion about 
whether a Holocaust could happen again.  And 
ma ny peopl e say, ﬁI think this is going to happen ag
ain.ﬂ  That there is goi ng to be some  kind of 
ma ss persecution of the Jewish people.  And so
me people feel like that™s not going to happen, 
but a lot of– it just come s up,and I™m wondering whether you feel like– you were talking a 

little bit earlier abou
t the legal system in this country.  Do
 you feel like that system is really 
stable enough so that there is 
not potential for that kind of disr
uption or do you feel like it is 
possible for something like that
 to happen in this country? 
 

A: In this country?   I woul
d like to think that it could not happen in
 this country in our lifetime  or in 
anybody else™s lifetime.  I think that when you read
 about any sort of fa
natical behavior, when 
you read about– it™s only been a 
hundred years or a little more, 
well a hundred fifty years since 
lynchings we re pretty commonplace in the South.  
And we had a, quote, ﬁlegal systemﬂ, that was 
not as– we didn™t have transporta
tion systems, and we lacked a lot of the modern conveniences, 
so that I think our life was a lot more rural.  Bu
t it seems to me that 
communities were pretty 
heartless about– I mean that there was, in the S
outh more so than any where else, but on a large 
scale, African-Ame ricans were property.  I mean
 they were property.  And anyone, and people 
seemed to accept that in a fairly major way.  I do
n™t know that it would happen just to Jews.  And 
obviously the Klan had put Jews and Catholic
s into a group, blacks.  But you know, we see 
things, we see the American Indian in this coun
try for years having, in not the very distant past, 
being treated as a second-class citizen.  You see–
 but in the next fifty years probably the white 
population as it is, or, quote, ﬁCaucasianﬂ population, 
will pr obably be a mi nority in this country.  
So I don™t know.  I do think that people can be fair
ly heartless.  I mean we
™ve had this, even with 
the go around with theTen Commandments we™ve had in this st ate recently, that we have 
educators and superintendents who don™t seem to
 get it, and don™t understand or can™t understand 
why anyone would object to putting those Ten Co
mmandme nt s on the walls of the school or a 
public building.  I mean that™s always pretty scary 
to me , and they wield a lot of influence.  And 
they could be leading, they could decide that
 they™re going to ma rch on any one of us.  Any 
lawyer who lived in a local community that pr
omoted, who was represen
ting the other side.  I 
don™t know that you would see anything like what
 happened in Germany, on that ma ssive a 
scale, where you™re filling boxcars with thousa
nds of people on a schedule that end up being 

cremated and killed and gassed.  But I think people 
can, there are leaders that appeal
 to emotions 
and that in, just the same  as the abortion clin
ics, you have folks who would like to defend the 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
101
 
 
 
101
fact that they can kill some body bec a use their view
 is different than thei
r own.  So I think it™s 
possible and I think it is probable they™ll contin
ue to happen as long as you have open gun, as 
long as gun laws are the way they are.  And as
 long as you have people who believe in these 
fairly, I don™t know, fundamentalist religions.  Wars 
are fought.  All the things that we™ve seen in 
the last few years, and ma ybe this country is a l
ittle different because of its tendency to become  
more homogeneous, both culturally and racially.  
But you think of all the Tutsis and the Hindus 
and you think Kosovo and you see all of these people and you see ma ssive– as far as they™re 
concerned it is a Holocaust.  Ri
ght?   I mean they are being killed in ma ssive numbers.  We just 
aren™t there.  I don™t know and you feel pretty help
less over here trying to 
do anything about it.  
So I don™t know, we can always ra
tionalize it by saying thos
e aren™t very civili
zed countries.  But 
all of these things seem to be done– I mean look 
at Israel and the Arab countries.  Both sides, 
certainly the Arabs, think that all of this is for Allah, and most of these ma ssive killings are 

religious wars.  And they are done in the name  of
 God for one side or th
e other.  Or the ethnic 
issues up there in Russia.  I mean tanks– so, who™
s to say that can™t happ
en here?    I would like 
to think it wouldn™t happen here 
because of all the different pr
essures that keep the country 
going.  For one thing, we ™re so ma terialistic, peop
le want to keep ma king money and they want 
to keep a society and keep the 
economy going.  And wars and inte
rnal fighting and disputes on a 
large scale, they ruin countries.  I think if it™s nothing more than that sort of selfish self-inter est 

and political interest, that pe
ople know they™re not going to allo
w anything of that scale to 
happen without calling out the National Guard or some thing.  At the same  time you see on the 

television, you see all those thi
ngs that you think some body was just
 writing a fiction plot a few 
years ago, they can happen.  Whet
her it™s biological warfare or so
me  goofy, this computer virus 
stuff.  We  se e that everything is possible with
 technology.  But I don™t kn
ow that anyone, these 
days, in this country, I™m not su re that we would have to fear
 a Holocaust.  I do think that 
mi norities who live in fairly isol at ed situations, I 
think are always some what vulnerable.  Here in 
Floyd County now, it™s a nice thing to say, we now
 have a mo sque here
 in Eastern Kentucky, 
which is, I think, a real milestone.  And we 
do have more and more Afr i can-Ame ricans and 
people of other cultures, who have
, are finding a home  and generally 
acceptance, at  least in some 
economic, to some  economic extent.  But I don™t know that they are not always somewhat 

vulnerable.  To some  extent th
ere are people who are here beca
use the area has needed more 
physicians and for economic reasons and they are 
excellent citizens.  Whether over time, like the 
osteopathy sc hool or if the economy gets worse, 
people, they will have become enough of this 
community where they would stay and would speak
 their mi nd.  I thought they were, they were 
totally silent during the Ten Commandment debate
.  I had encouraged some  of the m to speak 
out, because they were the most affected.  S
o, you, you know, it™s the same way with the Jewish 
communities during, the Jewish fami lies that move
d South in the earlier da ys.  They stood by, 

they were in their communities, they were me rc
hants in these towns and they could not join 
country clubs and they we re being discrimi nated 
against.  They had African-American ma ids at 
home .  And they were certainly willing to 
live in a segregated society, because it was 
economically favorable to them.  I think I ma y have
 said that earlier.  I 
think those things are, 
those are difficult ethical, philosophical issues.  Bu
t it has to create a certain level of discomfiture 
for people who are doing that.   
 

Q: Why don™t we go back and we were talking a li
ttle earlier about how we mi ght get some  more 
detail about your work on the Neshoba County case. 
 So, go back to there and then work forward 
again.  Last time we talked about it, you me ntio
ned a little bit about how you had been working 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007

102
on that case, but what were the details of what 
you were doing exactly on that case?   The murder 
of the three civil rights workers. 
 
A: Well, I worked on the case twi
ce.  The first time was in the gra
nd jury when I was talking to you 
earlier this morning about the f
act that after the FBI has inves
tigated a case , then we ge t the 
witnesses together.  And after the incident had 
happened in the summer of ™64, we had a grand 
jury in Mississippi, a federal grand jury.  But th
at was before there were
 any confessions.  And 
so we went to Neshoba County and the FBI ha
d uncovered a number of other police-br utality 
cases that, where local officials, the sheriff a
nd local police had acted 
illegally when beating 
blacks, primarily.  And we only knew the circum
stantial evidence of the killings of these 
workers.  We did not have a confession and so 
there was not any clear evidence.  We  did not 
have an indictme nt of that.  Then there was 
subsequently a confession. 
 When Jean and I came 
back from– yeah, then the indictme nts went to
 the Supreme Court, when there was an issue 
about, after the confession, when 
there was an indictme nt, there 
was a legal issue about whether 
these indictments stated a claim under federa
l law, because they also involved private 
conspirators along with some  police officers.  That
 question went all the wa
y to the United States 
Supreme Court.  It was decided in 1966, I thi
nk, and Jean and I got ma rried in 1967.  When we 
came back from our honeymoon, we , John Doar calle
d me– at the time was I still working in 
the Southeastern section?  He asked me  to co
me  down and work on the Mi
ssissippi case if I felt 
like my honeymoon was over.  And we were in Ne
w York at that point.  We™d been down to 
Saint Martin in the Caribbean.  And I said to J
ean that I just thought pr
obably with this I was 
ready to go back to work to
 try and finish this case. 
 

Q: How long had it been since you had gotten ma rried? 

 

A: We were, we were still on our honeymoon.  We
 got ma rried in February, 1967 and this was 
February, 1967. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: We flew back, back.  We  were out of the count
ry probably ten days and 
we were going to spend 
another five, four or five days in New York s
eeing some  plays or some thing.  But when you were 
were back in this country and this case was ready 
to go or we were ready 
to get in and get ready 
for trial.  So I kissed her good-bye and I went to 
Mississippi.  And I spent,
 specifically actually, I 
primarily did two things.  I spent almost a 
mont h interviewing people who were prospective 
jurors in the case.  Because nowadays they ha
ve psychologist , psychological, they ha ve these 

jury experts that are sitting, 
that sit with the lawyers and 
who™ve done big sophisticated 
background checks and they™ve even some ti me s tried 
cases to juries to tr
y them out.  They™ll 
have a mock trial and have a mock verdict. 
 But by learning through the black community, who 
the me mber s of the white community were that
 mi ght be trustworthy and who were supportive 
and who thought this was a dreadful thing, this
 killing of the three workers and who were 
upstanding citizens and who would 
know people, basically, I crea
ted a notebook of infor mation 
about the jurors.  I mean we didn™t know who the 
twelve would be.  You get a list of about forty 
or fifty.  And so I collected information on thes
e people by word of mouth primarily.  And met a 
lot of  people, and then put this notebook toge
ther for John Doar, who was my boss and for the 
U.S. attorney for trial, which they used in selecting the jury.

Q: How were the forty people selected in the first pl ace? 

 

A: They™re chosen out of the jury wheel, at that ti
me  in most states, they were chosen off the voter 
list, the voting lists.  You put all 
the voters– it™s a fede
ral court, so the district is much larger  
than just a county.  So you™re more apt to get peop
le that cover a much larger area.  And I think 

the trial was in Biloxi, in the 
Southern district of Mississippi 
with Judge Cox.  And s o these 
jurors were some what spread out.  I mean it wasn
™t all the way across the stat e, but it was in 
Southern Mississippi 
in several counties. 
 

Q: And was there some  kind of quota with the juro
rs, where there were supp
osed to be a certain 
amount white and a certain amount black? 
 

A: No, but there were blacks on the jury, but the bl
acks were, they were struck.  Now I was in some  
earlier trials in the early, when
 I first came, we ha d a trial in
 Georgia involving SNCC workers, 
who were some  voter registration workers, incl
uding several of whom were black.  And then 
later with the trial of Fannie Lou Hamer and they we
re all white jurors.  It was really at a time 
before, again it was something at  the time that wa
s not challenged as being unlawful, the system 
for selecting jurors and that resulted in no black
s being on the jury.  Now this particular jury, 
now in the Southern District, you would think, pr
obably, that half the people on the jury would 
have to be or  close to half would have to be 
black, because the voting requirements have been so 

slackened.  Because that was another part of this
 whole civil rights st rugg
le, was they were using 
literacy test s at the time.  I™m pretty sure– and 
that would ma ke sense, 
because the number of 
black voters back then was still very, very small,
 and so you had very few blacks.  And they were 
not, probably every qualified, voting black was proba
bly in the jury pool. 
 So, I don™t know if 
they were out of the, let™s say the twelve, that we
re called initially or fi ft
een, as they were being 
struck, there ma y have been several who were black, 
but they were struck, so that the jury was an 

all white jury.  But I was, of course, felt pr etty good, because we got a conviction.  So I felt like 

that work wa s at last helpful.  The other thi
ng that I was, we had always, the way we did our 

trials in the Civil Rights Divisi
on... I ma y have talked about this 
before.  We™d have two people 
inside the courtroom putting on the case and then
 the fellows outside th
e courtroom who were 
responsible for preparing witne
sses and ma king sure, and having th
ings go right.  In the Neshoba 
County case, my other responsibility, well th
ere were several others, but my one ma jor 
responsibility was to firm up the identification of
 the workers.  And that was– of these three 
civil rights workers who were ki
lled.  And that was done through th
eir dental records.  We  went 
back and found who their dentists 
were and the dentists™ charts a
nd compared them, in the event 
that that was in dispute.  I don™t think we put 
the dentists on, and it may be that it was admitted, 

but we did that.  And then there was clothing that
 had been retrieved from the workers, and the 
whole issue of proving that they were who we 
claimed they were, that they had been the 
murdered workers.  And then I did a lot of other,
 I did some – there were other parts of the case, 
where you™re trying to ma ke sure 
that everything is together.  
And some  of the witnesses were 
not heard.  There were people who, a deputy sher
iff at one point picked up a young woma n who 
was an IndianŠthere was a Choctaw reservati
on in that areaŠwho was an Indian, and she 
overheard a conversation.  But she didn™t speak Eng
lish.  So when we wa nted to go talk with her, 
we had to find an interpreter to try to tell us wh
at she was saying.  I think 
actually she did testify, 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
104
 
 
 
104
because she overheard them saying something th
at indi cated they knew what was about to 
happen or that they were going to stop the work
ers when they let them out of jail that ni ght. 
 
Q: So, she understood English, but couldn™t speak it? 

 

A: Right, she just spoke a very broken English and 
she reme mb ered some  phrases that they had said 
when she was picked up.  They gave her a ride.  I don™t reme mber how we tracked her down, but 

it was something that  was helpful like that.  Th
e grand jury, I worked on the grand jury a while, 

one of my r oles was nothing more than a logistic
ian.  I was in Biloxi, getting people driving from 
Neshoba County, but the grand jury was sitting 
in Oxford.  And we were moving, I was doing a 
little more than that, besides interviewing.  I kept
 taking people to the ai
rport and sending them 
from Biloxi to Oxford.  Keeping 
the witnesses going.  That took, we 
had a lot of logistical issues 
in getting, finding these people way out in th
e country and brining 
them downŠespecially 
African-AmericansŠwho had been mi streated, and ge
tting them to the air
port and getting them 
up there and back.  But then the fact that there 
wa s a conviction in this 
case, John did a, really 
quite a rema rkable, did a very, very good job in pres enting the case.  It wa s a big effort.  It was a 

very sad thing to kind of work on that.   
 

Q: Did you– you strike me  as a person with a lot 
of energy and a lot of drive to go on, but did you 
ever just feel depressed and have 
trouble getting out of the bed in 
the morning?   Or is that just 
not an issue for you?   (Laughing.) 
 

A: Back then or now or? 

 

Q: Well, in any of these.  I mean, I would, just 
picturing studying the dental
 records of these people 
who had been brutally murdered for working 
on a good cause.  And then you™ve done other work 
since then that™s had to have been 
very depressing.  I just wonder how– 
 

A: Oh I think you feel, it always has an impact 
on you.  I think that just for this purpose, you never 
forget the smell of those clothes–

Tape 9, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape nine, side A.  Will you, will 
you just repeat what you had started to say?  
 
A: Well, I was just saying in that
 particular situation I always can
 picture, we ha
d the clothing put 
away in boxes behind the door.  Bu
t it was really... the 
stench of those clothing was so strong, 
that it was always there.  And fo
r some reason that always stuck 
with me more than the dental 
records.  We ll, you do, you feel very badly for the 
fa milies, you feel kind of not very forgiving, I 
think, for the people who did this.  And of course, 
there were some  church burnings before that.  
The atmosphere around, in Mississippi and Nesh
oba County among the, in the white community 
and among t he Klan, that particul
ar group of Klansmen, Sa m Bowers
63
, the master mi nd of this 
one, who also was behind the firebombing of a
nother African-American, who was a voting rights 
leader in Hattiesburg, Mississi
ppi.  Vernon Dahmer, who, they 
firebombed his house.  These 
people were just pretty evil.  They we re violent, 
and just bad people in that
 sense.  So I think you 
have a, if anything you™re probably driven.  I don™t
 know that I ever felt 
depressed, I think most 
of us, and at the time  this was a pretty highly motivated group of lawyers, who worked in the 

Civil Rights Division.  It was a ve
ry relatively small group of lawy
ers in the early ‚60s.  It was 
sort of a sidelight, but I mean Congr ess™s commitm
ent to civil rights was not great either.  The 
Division had very few lawyers wo
rking on civil rights cases when
 I started in 1962.  And they 
had to beg for any mone y, and so there were very few of us a nd we worked on these voting 

rights cases, it took an enormous a mount of time  and 
it was hard to do more than two or three of 
them.  We ™d spend mont hs looking at records an
d mi crofilm.  And we worked extraordinary long 
hours.  He couldn™t understand w
hy people who were family me n 
with children would want to 
go home  at the end of the day and not come  back
 and work at night or work on Saturdays or 
work on Sundays.  Of course, there were some  fo
lks who got divorces over that hard work, just 
as they do in the Servi
ce, I think.  So I don™t know, I think th
at lawyers get depressed when they 
lose cases.  And we lost, we lost ma ny cases in 
the early stages in the 
lower courts, voting rights 
cases and others, because the judges themselves
 were segregationists 
and were appointed and 
came out of that society.  So we had to appeal th
eir decisions before and they were reversed and 
all of that took time.  So, when you work hard, 
it doesn™t ma tter what, if you work hard– then 
when we knew we were going to lose, it™s– and then
 you did lose, you™re sort of prepared for it.  
And you really are trying to put the case together 
in the first level, so 
that it™s a comp elling case 
to the next level.  And that™s what happened, 
we overprepared and we generally won, eventually 
we would win.  And then gradually the law starte
d to change.  It took a very long time, and so 
I™ve said ma ny times it was fortunate or ma ybe because
 of that slow pace and the limited role of 
the federal governme nt, that some body like Martin
 Luther King had to come  along.  Or that 
blacks had to organize themselves and realize, as
 so often happens, that 
people have to organize 
and that movements get started and 
that direct action has a place.  A
nd it all sort of came together 
in this instance around the Voting Ri
ghts Act of 1965.  That™s when Jean and I me t.  We were in 
Selma, we were in this case, th
is voting rights case, this Dallas 
County case was a case, the first 
voting rights case under the 1965 Voting Rights Ac t, th
at election.  I think 
we ma y have talked 
about that before.

Q: We did.  Is there anything else you wa
nt to say about the Neshoba County case? 
 
A: I don™t, not really, I think.  There was a very
 good, ma de for T.V. movie about that case.  I™m 
often asked about ﬁMississippi Bu
rning,ﬂ which is a popular movie 
that came  out, which was not 
really accurate in ma ny ways.  But I thought it depi
cted the hatred of the 
atmosphere at the time  
fairly well, and some  par t s of it were there.  J
ean and I have a, at our 
house, the painting of the 
sailboat in our living room is fr om the restaura
nt called, it was from Meridian, called Wi de ma n™s 
Restaurant, which was where we worked out of th
e Meridian office, which is close to Neshoba 
County.  But I don™t think so.  I me a n, one of the othe
r last things beside th
e Kent State thing that 
I did at the Civil Rights Divisi
on was to, you know after these folks were convicted, then they 
appealed their conviction and it 
went on.  That took a few years.  And I think one of the other 
last things that I did was to f
ile a brief opposing their last motion 
not to be sent off to prison.  I 
wrote the response to that 
and then they were picked up.  Then they finally went to jail.  So that 
was about 1970. 
 

Q: Do people ask you to speak about your 
civil rights era experiences very often? 
 

A: Not, it only come s, it come s up, well, my friend 
Ned Pillersdorf, who is a practicing lawyer here, 
teaches a class on the court system, on I think, civ
il liberties and the law.  And he generally has 
speakers come  in, other judges and I usually come
 in for a night with him.  And I™ve spoken a 
few other time s, but really not very much.  And 
I™m not sure that that ma ny people are aware of 
what I did.  I mean I don™t particularly publici
ze it.  If I™m giving a speech and some body™s 
writing some  background about my legal history,
 they™ll generally me ntion that.  But I don™t 
really do mu ch speaking about it.  Usually the 
schools have a unit on it
.  There™s a lot of, 
certainly a lot of written materials and most of
 those– Taylor  Branch™s books quote my boss, 
there™s a lot in Taylor
™s books about John Doar
64
.  And usually when books are written like that, 
that™s who they are going to write about.  I 
don™t know that I™m anybody n
ecessarily.  But locally 
if people ask, I will talk about 
the case s.  I mean I™ve spoken a few times, not recently about the 
legal developments of these, of how we put th
ese cases together and the Voting Rights Act and 
the impact of the Voting Rights Act.  But then
 I left in 1970 and I™ve 
been doing this legal 
services work for thirty years.  And unless thos
e things come  together some where, it™s become  
part of my, s ort of distant past, except for re
unions of Civil Rights Divi
sion lawyers and some  of 
the ongoing contacts I™ve had with pe
ople.  So not really very much. 
 

Q: I wondered if you want to say anything else 
about the desegregation work you were doing in 
Houston?   You me ntioned it in the last interview.  One of the th
ings that you me ntioned in the 
last interview that I thought 
you mi ght want to comment on now, 
is that you said it was the 
beginning of the Nixon admi nistration and you were 
seeing that that there was kind of a move 
away from real advancement with civil rights.  
And that Houston, working in Houston, there was 
not a, you didn™t give mu ch detail, but it seemed
 you weren™t very hopeful for things moving in a 
real positive direction 
there.  Do you want to talk about that?

A: Well, I think probably what I had reference 
to was after Richard Nixon was elected and William 
Mitchell became Attorney General
65
, they did not want to continue
 to seek bussing of students as 
a reme dy to undo segregation.  And bussing, Ch
arlotte had accepted a bussing remedy and 
several other states, too.  The pr
oblem is when you have a segregated community, so that white 
students, black students are, 
if you don™t use some thing like 
bussing, you can™t achieve very 
much integration, unless you pair up schools where 
the two housing districts 
happen to be close.  
Where they call that pairing of schools.  
You could pair schools that are in nearby 
neighborhoods.  But the Nixon admi nistration, so 
the Nixon admi nistration really backed, not 
only on bussing, but they generally fe
lt, I think, that the 
position of the Departme nt in the past 
had been too strong towards moving towards inte
grating classrooms.  And they were more 
inclined towa rds free choice, which would e
ssentially leave student– the schools white and 
black, with some  very few exceptions.  And th
e Houston case was filed right after the Nixons 
came in and we did ask for bussing as a reme dy.  A
nd it was the last case that they allowed that 
to go through.  In fact, the A
ssistant Attorney General, who 
was probably called on the carpet 
about it a little bit, because it ha d gone to him and he had approved it.  And I don™t know that he 
was brand new, whether he really focused on it as much as he mi ght have.  But the Attorney 

General had to, I think had to sign it as well.  We  
went forward in that case.  It was a very large 
case.  Houston was the third-larg
est school district in the countr
y.  I can™t reme mber, a couple of 
hundred schools.  They had, what they had done is
 spent millions and millions of dollars building 

new suburban schools outside, on th
e outer fringes of Houston.  At the same  time they let the 

inner-city schools decay, so it was re
ally doubly bad.  It wasn™t just
, in some school districts they 
tried to upgrade black schools to prevent desegrega
tion.  In Houston they di
dn™t care.  They spent 
all their money on white schools and let the black 
schools get worse.  So, but then at the same  
time they bussed white kids past black schools and bl
acks past white schools.  So we asked for, I 

had an expert from Mia mi, Florida, who was an 
expert in school desegregation ma tters.  What a 

mi nute, maybe he was from Austin, Texas.  Mike 
Stolee.  I guess he was from Austin.  We ll, one 
or the other.  And he testified as to the need to bus and that using bussing as a reme dy would 

produce a, basically an integrated school system, w
ith all the advantages that mi ght come , or that 

could come  with that.  There was mu ch more to it 
in the case than that, but basically that was it.  

The other phenomenon a t  the time was that the Chicano community was just developing, so that 

it was like we  had three donuts.  You had a co
re of inner-city black 
schools, then you had a 
small, growing donut around it of Chicano commun
ities and then you had all the whites on the 
outside.  But racially, Chicanos 
were treated as whites at that 
time, and probably still are.  
There™s a designation for themselves, but we were 
trying to desegregate a sc
hool district that had 
traditionally been black and white.  And so one of
 the things that the judge in the case did, was 
pair up some  white schools with Chicano schools,
 which I wasn™t particularly happy about.  I 

mean I don™t know that we had achieved very mu
ch, as we had hoped to do.  There were some  
other things.  We didn™t get a lo
t of bussing, but we got, the Boar
d was required to spend ma ssive 
amounts of money to get, to upgrade schools.  
And the other, probably 
the best thing that 
happened was they threw out the School Board.  
They voted in a new School Board that was 
much more moderate.  And they got rid of the 
lawyer who had gotten rich representing the Board 
and keeping the system segregated.  This case 
that I was working on had been filed many years 
before that and the NAACP had so
rt of reactivated it and urged th

with me , we  had not been ma rried too long and we 
rented an apartment, we lived there four or 
five months getting ready for this trial.  A
nd when it was over, we took a big trip and nine 
months later our son Michael was born.  Actua
lly we went to Canada, up to Calgary and– you 
ever been up there?  Lake Louise, Banff.  Wonde
rful country.  Houston, I still sort of scratch my 
head a little bit.  I haven™t kept up with what– 
there was an appeal of th
at order.  And I wrote 
part of the brief on appeal.  Still have it with me
.  But I always felt a little badly about the limited 
result of the pairing of the school
s, but I think it helped a great 
deal in the long run in different 
ways, to mo ve that system from wha t  it had 
been, where they had ju
st let the black schools 
deteriorate into such terrible condition.  Then
 let™s see, Michael was born in 1970, I still had a 
hearing, a pre-trial, I th
ink, not a pre-trial, but a conference 
right after he wa s born.  We  delayed 
it because I expected him to be born in April.  S
o, that was April 1970.  I th
ink that™s about it.  I 
don™t know if you™re thinking about 
some thing else in the case. 
 
Q: No, I just–  

 

A: Just a large, urban school case.  Took a long time
.  Lot of records, lots of lawyers working with 
us.  And I was able to get Jean to come
 with me  on that, to work on the case. 
 

Q: You talked about how you had come  to Kent
ucky and the whole pr
ocess of establishing 
yourselves in Prestonsburg and some of the ch
allenges involved in that.  And I thought ma ybe 
you mi ght want to say a little bit more about– on
e of the things that has struck me , just in 

reading a little bit about Appalr
ed and the early years 
and your talking about it last time that we 
talked here, is that when you talked about the di
fficulty of getting esta
blished, you said that it 
was difficult.  But from what other people have 
said, they suggested that it was a lot more 
difficult than you let on the last time  that we ta
lked.  I wondered if there™s... I mean you had 
me ntioned that you had trouble rent ing a place a
nd so forth.  But what else was happening 
besides that, during that time?   
Did any of the difficulty ma ke 
you feel like, ﬁOkay, if things 
don™t turn around soon, we™re out of here? ﬂ    
 

A: I don™t, I don™t, no, I don™t th
ink I had thought about being out of
 here.  There were a couple of 
things probably, one was one of 
the earliest cases that we were
 involved with, involved the local 
health care establishment, for exampl e.  There wa
s a federal program in here, that wanted to set 
up what is now a federally funded health care cl
inic, that Eulah Hall was associated with.  But 
the governing agency was a Community Action ag
ency, which had some  public officials and 

local doctors, who were either on the Board or
 very close to the governing Board and they 
basically didn™t want this thi
ng to do anything.  They were goi
ng to use it primarily as a taxi 
service to... they had a tr
ailer, which was fully equipped sitt
ing out, for example, at Mud Creek, 
but all they used it for wa s people would go to 
the trailer and then they™d drive them into 
Prestonsburg to get their me dical
 services from Prestonsburg phys
icians, that would get money.  
So, they were reimbursing them for s e rvices, but
 they wouldn™t allow an
ybody to be treated out 
there.  Not even a nurse to give them shots.
  And then they employed a doctor.  The local 
medical establishment threw a lot of
 roadblocks into his getting a lic
ense.  And it was just a lot of 
trouble getting it.  So the welfare rights groups
 came to me  and we f
iled some admi nistrative 
complaints and basically threatened to close 
the thing down.  I mean their decision was if it 
wasn™t going to work and be responsive, let™s just
 not have it.  Let™s no
t waste the money.  Well, 
two things happened, one was, of course, that Je
an wasn™t sure who her doctor would be, since 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
109
 
 
 
109
they were all ma d at us.  And so she wondered if
 she could get any child care, any me dical care 
for her son, who was less than a year old, or just 
about a year old.  And then the establishment, 
the doctors or the agency comp
lained to Congressman Perkins
66
 about it and he asked for an 
audit by the General Accounting Office of what we 
were doing, not just in this case.  There was 
at the same  time a lot of hostility by local lawy
ers to having our get started.  They thought 
basically we were going to take money out of thei
r pockets.  So the GAO sent an inspector here, 
which wasn™t too– but he was in our office for a
bout a month.  He looked at all, every piece of 
paper and then he issued– they
 ended up issuing a report which was really very favorable and 
compli me ntary.  And when I called Congressma n Pe
rkins to ask him about this thing, about his 
request, he said not to worry about
 it.  He was doing it to placate th
e local officials.  He was sure 
it was going to work out okay.  So there were thi
ngs like that.  And I had the local Bar was quite 
hostile.  I we nt to them on one occasion and asked them, told them I wa nted to set up a system to 

refer clients to lawyers who, if the clients weren™ t eligible for our services, if they ma de too 

much mone y, that we wanted a fair system.  So, w
ould they want to give me  a list of the lawyers 
in some  order, the ones that would take cer
tain cases and not take
–  So he appointed a 
committee to look into it.  The President said 
he thought that was a good 
suggestion.  Well, the 
committee met and their resolution was to suggest th
at we leave town, that
 we not practice law 
here without their permission.  It 
was sort of an indication of the 
atmosphere.  I mean there were 
a few, well I don™t know that we had any lawyers 
who were outside.  There were a couple of 
lawyers who had been here earlier, who had had 
a run in with me , but they were philosophically 
supportive of free legal services.  Because I wasn™t the– when I first came, there were some  

lawyers who had been working here with welfar
e rights folks.  They started some thing called 
Mountain Pe ople™s Ri ghts.  They saw their role more
 as being organizers than as being lawyers.  
They had not gotten their licenses, so we had 
a serious difference of opinion about how this 
needed to be done.  Cold air out here.  Oh, that™s 
the air conditioning, that™s wh
at that is.  Is it too 
cold? 
 

Q: It™s all right w
ith me .  You cold? 
 

A: No, it™s just blowing down, I di
dn™t know where it came from.  So, 
there were those things.  And 
I mean the medical– and the fact that I had hi
red, the first two lawyers I hired, J.T. Begley, 
Joe™s son, who had just come  out of the Marine
s and gone to law school 
and Mort Stamm, both 
of them were living in Le xington and were stay
ing down during the week and then they would 
go back on a weekend to their fa milies.  So, it was not
 a, it took a while to, I really di dn™t have 
any friends or that much of a s
upport system, especially since I was also sort of fighting with the 
other lawyers who had been here.  And Jean wa
s a new mother and was just tryi ng to get to 
know a few people who mi ght share values, beca
use the lawyers, the wives of the private 
practitioners, were really garden 
club types or people who were pr
etty much interest ed in money 
and materialism.  But she then, she st arted, grad
ually st arted teaching chil
dbirth classes.  That 
was a big, sort of avocation of hers
 and got her to have an
 interest outside of 
being at home .  So I 
think the fi rst, those ear
ly, that early year was probably– wa
sn™t much lonesome ness, I think it 
was beautiful.  I mean we knew, at the time we were
 not so sure that we w
ould be here that long.  
I think it was much more, as you said, ﬁThey™re not
 going to run me  out of town.  We ™ r e going to 
set this up.  We™re going to get st
arted.  There™s a lot of work th
at needs to be done.ﬂ  Legally 
there were ma ny more black and wh
ite, if you will, issues.  The law was, I mean the law did not

favor welfare claima nts.  A lot of things which 
we take for granted today, like the ri ght to a 
hearing and the right to your me dical
 records, if you™re involved in 
one of these, those things had 
not been established and they seem very basic.  So there were a number of these, almo st every 
time you looked at some thing involving a poor pers
on against an official in one of these 
agencies, including the environmental stuff.  Ther
e was so much to do and so much t hat needed 
to be done, that very few others were doing, that
 the work was very, very interesting from the 
very beginning.  It was very challenging.  We
 were just sort of outsiders, who were not 

particular ly welcome in the community. 
 

Q: What about among the clientel
e?  What kind of relationship 
did you have with most of the 
clients?   Wa s it just strictly profes
sional?   And did you feel a good rapport? 
 

A: Oh I think people who come  to you as a lawyer
 for free service, especially who are just, who 
realize that lawyers are there, w
ho want to help them and are inte
rested in them and are treating 
them like people.  And then when they see that in
 court they are meeting 
the other side with the 
same, if not even better, with more competent lawy
ers, they™re pretty proud of that.  And I think 
the clients have been– always from the first da
y, even when I was in the Civil Rights Division 
when I represented the United States, I always ad
mi red them a great deal.  Most of them had 
difficult lives, have serious problems.  They™re 
very genuinely nice people.  They don™t always 
have the advantages that the rest
 of us have.  Sometimes in the dome stic relations cases, there 
really aren™t any winners and 
the children are losers.  And 
I don™t know– we have a lot of 
debates in legal services about 
the value of spending so much time on domestic cases.  And back 
then probably the divorce rate was probably twen
ty-five percent, today it™s over fifty.  So, the 
dema nd for what we do in that area, because people
 fight over kids.  And the legal syst em hasn™t 
adjusted.  You have to have a lawyer in these 
things and there just aren™t enough lawyers to go 
around.  In this area there aren™t enough people 
who can afford lawyers, so you either have 
people who go without representation, 
if they don™t– or they have to look to us.  But on some  of 
the larger issues, the consumer cases or even the 
evictions or the others, that generally oftentimes 
you have an opportunity, to help some one ma ke a r
eal difference in their lives.  As you can see 
in the case listings that we  put t
ogether, I think that thos
e are all very signifi
cant, very important.  
I think that™s so, but it wa s not an easy start.  
And now in retrospect, it do
esn™t seem like it™s not 
such a huge amount of ti me .  And I think, I™ve 
always said I don™t twis
t anybody™s arm to come  
to this program.  You ha ve to want to be ha
ppy in a small community and that has pluses and 
mi nuses.  You can™t get lost in anonymity, which 
I think small towns have a lot going for them.  
But at the same time you can feel very isolat ed 
if you™re going uphill, and we often are.  I mean 
you™re stepping on toes a lot.   
 

Q: Does that happen still? 

 

A: Well, we still step on toes.  I think now there ar
e, we don™t, I don™t like 
to step on toes if we 
don™t have to do that.  And we try to
 avoid it and we™ll try to negotia
te cases before we file them.  
I think the program now, thirty ye
ars later, has a lot of support 
and so, public support, so people 
sort of expect to see that peri
odically.  When they see a case 
that™s in the paper, where we™re 
taking on as some body would say another cause or
 fighting, filing a case for some one who™s an 
underdog or who™s against the county 
or a hospital or against a coal 
company, they sort of take it 
for granted.  I mean they understand that back 
then it was very unusual and the clients probably 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
111
 
 
 
111
were, I™m sure, supported back then.  I just think that people feel a little 
more empowe r ed today.  
The economy has been bad, and I think the coal 
industry over time has done, it has not been very 
good, without being forced into ma king changes that
 are, to require, which require safe mi nes 
and low dust levels and environmental measures th
at ma ke, that will restore the property after 
mi ning.  All of those things have come–

112
Tape 9, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape nine, side B. 
 

A: It seems that companies just won™t regulate th
emselves.  They will not.  We™ve seen that over 
and over again, whether it™s the 
chemical industry or the mi ning 
industry.  Because where people 
are looking for profit, primarily, they don™t want
 to shut some thing, a mi ne down, long enough to 
fix what™s broken or to take real measures 
to keep dust leve ls down until some body has ma de 
them do it.  Because every time you do that, you 
have to slow production down a little bit and 
you won™t produce as much.  So, as a result you ha
ve a high incidence of 
black lung disease and 
you have an unfriendly worker environment.  Finally
 things have started ch
anging in the last few 
years.  So now I think it™s much mor e  accepted, if 
that™s the right word, I think people even can 
understand or they see it happening and they see th
at that™s probably one 
of the roles that we 
play.  And that we have done over 
the years, but I think 
at the same  ti me  they can see that what 
we do is responsible.  That we have good lawyer
s.  That we don™t ma ke up law suits and that 
generally there™s a good reason fo
r what we do.  When we can do some thing in the community, 

like the housing project, where we™re working with
 public officials, who are now, who want to 

do some thing for people who let™s say live in subs
tandard housing, out of their own sense of duty 
or their own feeling that everybody™s entitled to ha
ve a decent place to live in.  If you™ve got that 
sort of in county governme nt, then those are people
 we can work with and not have to sue.  I 
mean, I™d like nothing better than to have us, to
 be able to put ourselves out of business.  
(Laughing.)  But, I don™t know, I th
ink that™s a long way off.   
 

Q: You talked last time  about your, about a 
few of the cases– Do you need a coffee break?   
(Laughing.)  Do you, okay, so last time you talked a
bout the Broad Form Deed and how that case 
was dealt with and the victory that resulted from
 that.  And you talked about the development of 
the community in David and I™m wondering– and you 
also talked about the establishment of the 
Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which was called 
Fair Tax Coalition fi rst, and the work that 
that organization started on doing.  
So I think those were the ma in
 things that you talked about 
during this era that you have been in Prestons
burg.  I™m wondering if
 you want to highlight 
anything else from those years?   Go
 into detail about anything else? 
 

A: Well, I think we™ve– there are some  other sort
 of unique things that 
we™ve done.  I think I™m 
very proud of the work that we™ve done on behalf 
of coal mi ners, who have refused to work in 
unsafe conditions.  We  established a mi ne safety 
project, where we represent those mi ners in 
seeking a reinstatement and dama ges for 
having been fired unjustlyŠexcuse me Šor 
discrimi nated against unjustly.  I 
think that™s been real successful
.  And the lawyer who did that 
for a number of years, Tony Oppegard, who is no
w the Assistant to the Di rector of the Mine 

Health and Safety Admi nistration, 
who was an Appalred lawyer in We st Virginia years ago.  I 

think that™s been very significant.  We™ve re
presented a lot of disabled coal mi ners in 
applications for black lung benefits, this fe
deral program, whe r e so ma ny people, right now, 

ninety-five percent 
of the people are denied, because the gove
rnme ntal regulations are so severe 
and it™s so di ffi cult to obtain the claims.  But 
we still ma nage– and the private bar hardly does 
those cases at all.  So we™v
e worked with the Black Lung 
Association, Bill Worthington, for 
example, officers of the Black 
Lung Association, in trying to 
get Congress to be, relax those 
requireme nts and to have better regulations that 
are fairer, that we see a more reasonable number 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
113
 
 
 
113
of people be approved for black l
ung benefits.  We have won ma ny of those claims, the ones that 
we™ve screened and where private attorneys finally
 gave up.  Because it takes so long for private 
attorneys to get their fees and because they™re 
so complex and take so long, we™re going to get 
another lawyer to come  in pretty soon, nearer in
 the next few months to do that.  And the mi ne 
safety and black lung work sort of go hand in han
d.  The same  thing is true of coal mi ner, of 

pension benefits.  We  ha d a case we went to
 the United States Supreme Court on involving 
pension benefits where we lost.  But it really help
ed them, I think, in some  ways to re-write their 
requireme nts.  But Gracie, it™s the Gracie 
Robinson case, a wo ma n up here, a widow up in 
Auxier, whose husband had worked over thirty y
ears in the coal mi nes, but had not stopped 
working and applied.  And he died in the coal mi
nes in an accident.  And the requirements for 
obtaining a widow™s pension was that the mi ner 
should have applied for a pension and stopped 
working.  And since he was killed in a mi ne accide
nt they said he hadn™t applied for hi s pension, 
they wouldn™t give her her pension.  We said that was arbitrary.  If he™s worked thirty years and 

you only have to have twenty-five to get a pensi
on.  And he wanted to keep working, that it was 
like punishment at that point.  We  won and then we 
lost in the District  c
ourt and then we won in 
the Court of Appeals for the Distri
ct of Columbia and then we lo
st in the United Stat es Supreme 
Court.  But they did actually re-write that pr
ovision in the bargaining contract.  But I think the 
work we do for low, for disabled mi ners has been 
really important .  I think the– in the last  fe w 
years we™ve started a mi grant farm worker pr
ogram up in Richmond, wher
e we got some  money 
from the legal services Corporation to help mi
grant workers throughout the state.  We have a 
very small grant.  It™s only about 35,000 dollars
, so we™ve done that co-operatively with a 
program in Texas that represents these folks fulltime.  And we™ve ma na ged to file some  of the 

first cases with respect to working conditions.  
I mean there are cases where the workers come up 
here and the grower breaches 
the contract or at least our 
workers claim the growers have 
breached their cont ract by not providi ng the work
ing time that they claime d they would or the 
working conditions under which they would wo
rk.  And the program, the Western Kentucky 
program had the grant a few of years ago and they 
just coul d not really fi nd the workers and we 
were, by getting together with the people in Te
xas, the paralegal from Te xas came up and who 
helped– who helped to do this project, did 
the outreach work.  And oh [YAWNS]  and for 
example he would meet the bus, the Greyhound bus 
comi ng in at one o™clock in the morning at 
the station and give out his card 
to the workers and then they would know how to contact him.  
That kind of thing.  And you have to be bilingual,
 obviously, but I think that™s been a very, even 
though we have very few mi grant workers out here
 in Eastern Kentucky, th
ere are a number of 
other areas in the state, especi
ally where they have large t
obacco farms in Western Kentucky, 
that™s where we™ve had so ma ny of our cases.  
I think most recently the development of our 
housing coalition he re, called LI NKS
67
, where we™re doing this huge home  repair project.  With 
all the groups that are comi ng in fr
om out of state.  And just bri
nging all these agencies together 
under one roof, so they can collaborate and work
 together, I think has been a real positive 
development.  Showing people how they can, I m
ean we™ve pulled together a lot of different 
agencies and non-profits, who ar
e all addressing housing issues, in
to one collaborative.  And I 
think everybody™s been real pleased with that.  
I think we™ve been able 
to do that because we 
don™t have any axes to grind or turf.  We  just sa
id, ﬁ We want to do this 
and we™re willing to do it 
if you all will cooperate and we 
can seek funding together, and do 
some  cooperative work.ﬂ  And 
so now I actually am sharing a grant with the fi
scal court, which would have, and for a worker 
here, who is a young woma n who came from Jean™s 
program.  A participant, who is very, very

bright and who has move d up very fast.  Who is a single parent.  Could go to law school if she 
were willing.  And that ma kes me  fe el good.  
And we™ve had a number of people like that, who 
are single parents, who have been on welfare, w
ho have worked with us in a training situation 
over a few months™ time and have really, really so
rt of progressed so quickly and come  out of 
their shell and have mo ved on to 
good jobs.  I think we have a pr
etty extraordinary group in most 
of the offices.  It™s a good program to me , I 
me a n if I go through the senior staff in this 
organization, I™m just really proud of who they 
are and what they do.  Many of them have been 
with me  a long time and each of them has different
 skills, but they™re all committed to what we, 
this representation of low-income  persons, who ot
herwise wouldn™t be able to have lawyers.  
Whether it™s for a mundane situati
on or some thing that is pretty ex
citing, that will really effect a 
lot of other people in the future
.  I think we™ve, I think we do
 very, very good legal work and I 
think we have real  committed people who are doing it. 
 

Q: Do you want to say anything, you™ve been me ntioni
ng that it™s been kind of a turbulent time for 
legal services in general.  Do you wa nt to sa
y some thing about your perspective on the state of 
legal services and what dire
ction it might be taking?    
 

A: Well it™s all conjecture.  I th
ink those of us who have been doi
ng this a long time are sort of, 
have been disappointed the last few years, be
cause we really have not been able to get 
appreciable new funding at the fede
ral level.  And this program 
was established at the federal 
level to provide free lega
l services to the poor and to be a 
non-political program.  When it was 
the last, one of the last things that  Presiden
t Nixon signed, was this Bill that created this 
corporation.  And we expanded and got addi
tional money from 1974 to 1980.  And we went 
from like forty million nationally or fifty, to th
ree hundred and twenty-one.  And when Governor 
Reagan came in as president he was ready to dest
roy, to get rid of legal 
services, because of his 
experience.  They had sued him in California.  A
nd I won™t go through all that history, but really 
since the Reagan and that first year, instead of ge
tting rid of us they ma de a compromi se and we 
lost twenty-five percent of our 
mone y, which is a lot.  And we™ve never really recouped that 

money.  We ™re now still not
 at the level we were in 1980.  So th
at most of us have half as ma ny 
lawyers as we did in 1981.  We  we
re able to– but there have been ma ny efforts in the meanti me 
in Congress to just elimi nate the 
program.  And we™ve been able to forestall that, which says a 
lot.  Because  congressi onal support now is pre
tty strong.  Unfortunately the subcommittee chair 

for legal se rvices is fr om this District.  It ™s Ha
l Rogers from Some rset.  
And whereas he™s able to 
bring back lots of money for other local projects
, he has never, either he™s not a fan of legal 
services, or he is trying to mollify the people above him and the others whom he works with, 

because hi s latest – for the last  couple of years, that committee has passed out a recommended 

budget which is only about half the size of our
 funding level, 140 out of 300 million dollars.  
And that™s been real disappointing, but he likes to
 say that he is keeping it going and that there 
are budgetary shortages, and that the other people
 on his committee are not as strong as he is.  
And he would be supportive.  And be sides he know
s that our supporters w
ill be able to get the 
funding level up on the floor of the House, once it ge
ts to the floor.  And that™s what™s happened.  
But I™m disappointed in him.  I wish he were a li
ttle more aggressive or could do more at his end, 
which he probably could if he wanted to.  But–
 excuse me just a mo ment.  In the meantime 
we™ve been fortunate to get some  mo ney through th
e State Legislature and 
I think that™s been a 
real positive thing in the last few years, 
where our own legislator
s have recognized the 
importance of legal services.  We  did not get any 
more money this year, but we did get a repeat

115
of last year and so about half 
of our funding is now state funding.  
I think it™s conjecture, as I was 
telling you there are lots of possi
bilities.  I think our current co
rporation feels that it™s more 
efficient to have a single entity in the state, 
covering the state.  Because the President of the 
corporation is a former private 
attorney from the stat
e of Wa shington, however, where they have 
a very effective, single state program.   Time  
will tell us what will happe
n there.  I don™t know.  
And some  other– anybody el
se?   I think I just lost
 my train of thought.   
 
Q: Well, it sounded like you were basically fini
shed with your train of
 thought, weren™t you? 
 

A: I was talking about the state 
funding, right?  That we didn™t ge
t any more funding this time or 
that we were– how far did 
I get with state funding? 
 

Q: Said that this year, you™re at the same level th
at you were at last year. 
 You weren™t cut anymore, 
but–  
 

A: We weren™t cut and we were ve
ry pleased that we  were able to get additional money last time .  
We have two sources of state funding, one for th
e filing fee and one for 
a general appropriation.  
And this time, ma ny programs did not get increases
.  There were a lot of
 one-time expenditures, 
like the Science Center, got a litt
le more money.  But I think a lo
t of ongoing projects, except for 
the new ones like the childcare mone y that I think actually, some
 of it™s out of the tobacco 
money.  So, this is a year again, where we have 
no more new money, state or federal.  And that 
ma kes it difficult because if you want to give  peop
le salary increases, you either have to lose 
positions or some thing else to free up additiona
l funds.  I don™t know whether– and so there is 
this tendency in our funding agency to pull progr
ams together.  There is
 the thought that state-
wide programs are more efficient. 
 I don™t think there is any real pr
oof of that anywhere.  I mean 
I don™t know that they have evidence 
of that.  It ma y be more effi
cient to admi nister, because one 
person can ma ke a decision instead of four.  Yo
u mi ght be able to be more homogeneous around 
the state.  I would like to 
think that legal services is here to st
ay.  I think for the most part it is.  I 
think there are people in Congress,
 who think of, that it could be 
organized differently.  When I 
was talking about a state-wide or
ganization.  Or whether– I know th
at one of my counterparts in 
Virginia would rather be part, consolidate with 
us, because our client population is so much the 
same .  The Appalachian counties do have a lot in
 common.  Whereas in Virginia you have only, 
all of the st at e in West Virginia is in Appalachia
.  And Virginia, a small part of the state is in 
Appalachia.  So, whether they would allocate en
ough resources to that one or two programs  in 

that corner is something that time will just have to tell.   
 

Q: Do you want to take a break and stretch out? 

 

A: I think I need– 

 

A: Well, the other thing that ™s been so di ffi cult w
ith legal services has been the restrictions that 
Congress has placed on us in more recent years, 
which prevent us from filing Class Actions or  
challenging Welfare Reforms, accepting attorney f
ees, not being able to represent pr isoners.  
Those things all seem to, one could view them 
as ma king us second class lawyers.  There is no 
real, rational explanation for them when the preamb
le to the legal services Corporation Act stat es 
that you should not interfere with the professional 
responsibility to your clie
nt.  And that clients 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
116
 
 
 
116
have the right to have full represen
tation fr om legal services lawyers.
  So there™s, it™s not a very 
favorable atmosphere to work under.  It doesn™t 
mean we still can™t do ni
nety-five percent of the 
cases, because many of them still fit into, ar en™t  affected by those prohibi tions.  But it is 
some thing that needs to be changed.  And it™s pur
ely a political affair.  And you have the national 

opponents of legal services, who are always looki
ng for one more anecdote to pull out as being 

the kind of thing that goes on.  I mean, no one™s
 perfect.  So you find so
me body™s statistics aren™t 
quite right and all of a sudden 
everybody in the country has to 
be on guard for an inspection, 
even though we– the way we are funded is by the number of poor people in our areas, not by 

the number of cases we do.  So there™s always a 
level of, if not harassme nt, of paperwork that 
grows and grows and leaves less time for the real wo
rk that needs to be done.  But at that same  

time it™s good that we are able to get this money 
because you really can™t fund this kind of work 
with private fundraising. 
 You could do a limited amount of it , 
but not very much.  We , I think 
we™re fortunate to be able to get good lawyers. 
 We don™t pay equivalent 
salaries.  And we have 
people comi ng to work with very large, outst
anding loans from undergraduate and law school.  
We™ve instituted a small repayment program that
 is helpful.  But we™ve just incr eased our 
starting salaries to $27,000, which 
is a big step forward.  It™s 
still behind ma ny of the private 
firms and many of the state a
nd federal agencies.  And then we only go up about thirteen 
hundred a year for, first for nine mo nths and th
en for a year.  But all the same , I think we™re 
competitive and we have some  good benefits.  A
nd we are able, have been fortunate to get 

people who are really committed.  So I am very pr oud of the work we do.  I am very proud of the 

people who are here and who do the work.  We  ha
ve wonderful relations, 
I also should me ntion 
with the spouse abuse shelters.  That™s another pr
oject we™ve started in the last  few years, is to 
have specialists who work, who represent abused
 spouses at dome stic 
violence hearings.  And 
we™ve gotten very involved in that area and I thi
nk the family court judges appreciate us and the 
shelters appreciate us.  And it is a huge amount of
 our practice, more than we would like.  But 
it™s one of those societal problems 
that we have to deal with, so we are very interested in the 
rights of children and the rights of these wome n.  Of course, it™s 
wonderful to have people like 
my wife, Jean, out trying to help move them
, gain some  independence and get back into 
education and develop their careers in a way th
at they can be producti
ve and independent on 
their own.  I™ve been real proud of
 the people that have come from
 her program into my office, 
both for representation and severa
l who, at least one of whom is employed now as a full-time 
person here.  It continues to be pretty exciting 
work.  I never, never lack for anything to do.  
Close to the end?

Tape 10, Side A 
 
Q: Okay, tape number ten, side A, an intervie
w with John Rosenberg.  I guess now would be a good 
time for you to say some thing about your wo
rk with establishing the Science Center. 
 
A: Okay.  Well, I was a chemistry major as I th
ink you know, and I think that we™ve always known 
that the scores of our students he
re in science and ma th were very
 low and that science, ma th and 
technology was not valued very highly.  So a 
number of years ago, ma ybe nineteen, some where 
between 1990 and ‚92, I asked teachers, some  teacher
s to come together and some other folks in 
the community to see whether we mi ght not start 
a, developing some  ideas for improving ma th 
and science, and what they thought.  And what 
we learned was that teachers were very uneasy 
about teaching ma th and science.  Many of them 
had very poor backgrounds during their teacher 
training and they were ill-equipped, es
pecially at  the elementary level, to try to present scientific 
concepts.  And they really wanted more hands-on 
activities to support them. 
 So we, we sort of 
me t periodically and then over the next couple of 
years.  And then I saw a small video segment, 
or heard about it, about a college up in Penns
ylvania, We stern Pennsylvania, Juniata College
68
, 
which had obtained funding for a science van, 
where a chemi stry teacher was driving a van 
around and dropping experime nts o
ff at high schools, dropping off equipment that the schools 
couldn™t afford to buy.  And was like a sort of
 Johnny or Jeanie Appleseed, would tell school A 
about what school B had done with 
these things.  Over the course 
of several years the number of 
incomi ng students at Juniata College who were, w
ho ma jored in or who showed an interest in 
science, studying science-relate
d courses, like tripled.  So, I 
thought it would be, then got to 
thinking that we would like to, w
ouldn™t it be nice if we did 
some thing like that.  I had not, I 
don™t think had really thought about the planetarium theater kind of
 thing yet.  But we were 
meeting and we got a small grant back about 1990, 
ma ybe ‚94 as a result of this work and this 
group that kept meeting.  We  realized that we 
could ma ybe establish a 
center like that if we 
could get some  funding.  So, we got
 a little mone y out of the legisl
ature, I think 75,000 dollars to 
hire a consultant.  One of the legisl
ator s here in this area, Greg Stumbo
69
, was interest ed in 
technology and with KERA
70
 having come  in I think there was a strong, an atmosphere that was 
conducive to getting some  funding.  And I thought 
we should start off in a small way, so we 
hired a consultant from West Virginia, Mi
ke Howard, who had worked in the Kentucky 
educational system, to do some  community meetings
 and help us look at more specifically where 

we fit and what kind of activities would be helpful.  And it sort of reinforced what we  had 

already known in some  ways, that teachers want
ed hands-on Mr. Wi zard kinds of things.  And 
that if we could bring pres
entations to them and do some
thing like the science van and 
educational programs, that that would be help
ful.  And I don™t know wh
ere I first came up with 
the idea of trying to do a planetarium or a science 
museum or really, I thou
ght it mi ght be nice if 
we could even replicate a coal mi ne.  But I starte
d, we started talking that 
up and realized that if 
we had a mo dern facility it woul
d be really meaningful.  And I 
also learned that you could, they 
had these portable planetariums
 that you could take around to sc
hools, which are little– they 
call them planetarium in a foot locker, where you
 blow up, it™s like a viny
l thing and you blow it

up in a classroom and you can put thirty kids 
in it that will watch a star show and other 
educational shows.  And so, by the time the ne
xt legislature rolled 
around, I think we got 
200,000 dollars.  We  wer e  able to increase our oper
ating grant and on a fairly short notice we got 
a local architect to put 
together just a schema tic of what 
a theater and planetarium mi ght look 
like and what it could do, and that we would, a
nd that– I think we ma y have even still been 
thinking about a coal mi ne.  And we put together
 a board, I organized a board of directors that 
included representatives from Mo
rehead and from the Alice Lloyd
71
 and Pikeville College and 
PCC
72
 and Hazard and the teachings, the scien
ce teachers and the regional educational 
cooperatives to give us a good cr
oss-section of me mbership and 
also a good geographical cross-
section.  And it™s been, and that™s
 basically the story.  And they helped me , we went to convince 
them, during the last legislative 
session, our local legislator agreed
 to get behind it and we ma de 
a presentation to the Governor and he liked 
it and called me at home one day to go over the 
budget.  Wa nted to know why I had a budget item 
for rent.  He was very me ticulous.  ﬁ Why do 
you need this three hundred dollars when you™re 
going to have–?ﬂ  I said, ﬁGovernor, we won™t 
be in that place for a couple, few years yet.  We  need a budget place, we need an office.ﬂ  But 

anyway, we got through that with two and a half
 million dollars, and then this time – so we 
planned some  more, but because of the reorga ni
zation of the college , Kentucky college system, 

KCTC S and UK
73
, the two years went by without any build
ing.  There was a lot of planning, but 
we just got caught in the upheaval of this edu
cational thing, until KCTCS could get on its feet.  
So, in the meantime we put together a proposal 
for another million dolla
rs, probably should have 
been for mo re.  And after all th
e wrangling, we were one of the 
fortunate ones at the end to get 
the million dollars, because Greg Stumbo, who is from here, is a pretty powerful figure and was 

essentially, he and Benny Ray Bailey, who got beat in 
this last election, were 
able to pretty much 
get all the one-time  funding projects through that th
ey asked for.  So, now we are, we just last 
week had our meeting with the architects and KC
TCS folks a nd college representatives and we 
are settled on where the site is going to be and 
we have a basic floor plan.  And I hope two years 
from now the building will be standing.  It pr
obably will be .  And then that means another 
legisl atur e will have passed and hopefully we mi ght even increase the operating costs of our 

group.  We  got a little more money for that.  But 
I™m very excited about what we will be able to 
do, both for students who are in this
 region, who can™t really, who neve
r see this sort of thing at 
this sophisticated level.  Ther
e is now a planetarium at Eastern in Richmond, which a lot of 
people don™t even know about.  But I think if we do th
is well, it can stimulate a lot of interest in 
science and technology.  We  have now decided to 
expand our laboratory facility so that we will 
be able to, from a classroom into a sort of la
boratory classroom, so we can do experime nts in 
DNA fingerprinting and other chemi cal experime nts, at least dem
onstrative experime nts.  And 
we™re comi ng up with what I think is pretty exci
ting.  Our Director we™v
e hired is from Pike 
County, he was born there, although he grew up in
 Michigan.  And we have, as I say, a very 
good board and so I™m, I think that it will be a ve
ry important part of the future of Eastern 
Kentucky.  I think that we  now have a new indus
try in Pike County, a knowledge-based industry, 
where a call center, Micr
osoft, if you call an 800 number fo
r Microsoft and you need help on 
your computer, they™ll pick up the phone down ther
e and give you answers to
 technical questions 
from their computers, which is a breakthrough in
 terms, because our coal economy is declining 
so quickly in terms of the number 
of people they can hire.  So this is an area that we have to

move into, that I think can have an appreciable e
ffect on kids.  People want to be scientists and 
they want to be astronome rs and they want to be
 explorers and they can see that happen.  And I 
think that™s what the role of this building 
is going to be.  And obviously, you know, we™re going 
to need more money and I could spend all my time ra
ising money for this facility for that  matter.  
We™re going to be hiring a developm
ent director, but I™m very much 
invested in this project.  So 
that™s what it™s about. 
 
Q: And are you, what are you picturing 
your role to be in future years? 
 

A: Well, I™ve been the chair of th
e board since its inception.  Wh et
her they™re going to kick me  out 
any time soon, I™m not– but I ma y, and I™ve been pret
ty active in that part
icular role.  I don™t 
know.  I mean I think it™s very exciting.  Actually 
it™s the result of, and in 
part it goes back to my 
scouting da ys, because when I– did I talk about
 scouting be fore?   When I was growing up and 
Bud Schiele?   Maybe I me ntioned at the time that th
at  inspired me to sort
 of get involved with 
this here.  Because we added such a wonderful 
museum in my home  in Gastonia, now, which 
grew out of a very small effort that st arted ther
e.  And I mean there is, cert ainl y we will need 
people to volunteer to do everythi ng from just showing kids through the place to actively being a 

part of the soliciting gr oup or– and I will pr obably be involved.  But I™m still very interest ed in 

practicing, in the practice of law.  And if I we
re not doing legal services
 work, I™d probably be 
down the street with my friend Ned, and at leas
t part-time working with him or working on my 
own, or taking in a few cases, because I enjoy doi
ng them.  So, I™m not sure that I would just 
stop and do the Science Center.  
Or ma ybe I™d be working with the housing group down here.  I 
think I™d like to get our– I mean when you, it™s ki
nd of getting to what else
 I™d like to be doing.  
I have a number of other interests, but I know I 
enjoy working.  And I think when my  daughter is 
out of graduate school and I feel like we have 
no more immediate important
, sort of potentially 
ma jor expenses within the fa mily that I would st
op.  I mean I could stop 
I suppose.  But I think 
it™s a great development.  There may be somethi
ng else that come s up in the community.  I me an 
I™m very involved with the historical group, the 
Fr iends of the May House, where we™ve renewed 
this, restor ed this old building, which I™ve been a 
part of for twenty years.  And I™m st ill working 
on some of their legal documents 
to get a conservation easement 
at the mome nt.  And I™ve been 
proud of what we™ve done in that particular th
ing.  And we need to raise some  money, because 
we want to try to get that building open and k
eep it open.  Everybody that is there is a volunteer 
and nobody has time to do any fund-raising.  And that
™s just one of those things.  And I know 
that from my experience where I am here, I™ve 
done a fair amount of f
und-raising.  I don™t get a 
lot of private money, but I™ve wr
itten a number of those grants 
and I know the system that you, 
how you do it.  And I know I could do that there. 
 So, there™s plenty for me to spend my time on.  
Where I would do it, and I mi ght still, you know, in
 the practice of law if you get an interesting 
case and it™s a big case it can eat you up, timewise. 
 It™s like putting together a play or  a book or 
radio program. 
 

Q: You me ntioned your mo ther a little earlier and 
what™s your, when you m
eet up with her and see 
her, do you, do you usually talk about your fa mily hi
story at this point?  
What kinds of, what 
kind of relationship do you have with her? 
 

A: Oh, we™re very close.  I think 
she is close to all three of her 
children, ma ybe more so than ever 
since my father passed away.  And at various tim
es, last time when mother was here we did a 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
120
 
 
 
120
little more oral history.  I always
 tend to, it™s one of those thi
ngs you just sort of get yourself 
into.  You may be talking about Passover and tr
ying to reme mber what the lemon cream recipe 
was that she used to do.  And then you talk a
bout how Passover was in 
Germany.  And then who 
their friends were that came  to Passover and a
ll of a sudden you™re into some  history that you™d 
forgotten about or when she went off to learn 
to cook as a young girl.  And so she™s still, the 
stories are still there.  Not all of them are reco
rded.  And she still corresponds with people in 
Germany.  Her mi nd is very good and she really enj
oys being with us, so it™
s fun to travel with 
her.  Jean has a really good rela
tionship with her.  I think my fa
ther was a very dominant, strong 
personality, a very smart ma n.  And mother grew 
up in a small country town.  And I think being 
a traditional, they had a very traditional relations
hip, where he was sort of the power figure in the 
fa mily and she cooked and kept house and was very proud of her motherly role, as ma ny Jewish 
mothers are.  But Mom™ s really pretty sharp.  A
nd I almost want to say I think her mi nd™s gotten 
even better in the last few years, ma ybe because 
of, by having to be a little more independent and 
living on her own, she has, you know, it™s br
oadened her horizons some what.  But– 
 

Q: How old is she now? 

 

A: Huh?   She™s eighty-eight.  Sh
e™ll be eighty-nine in August, ninety next year.  But she™s very 
strong physically and very, still ge
ts on her bicycle.  So she™s k
eeping up. When my sistertook 
her on a cruise recently to the Panama Canal, they
 got off at some  island 
to go sight-seeing and it 
turned out they were going up a mountain some wh
ere and she still kept 
up with everybody.  And 
I think pe ople, people are always quite amazed 
at her energy and her, you know, sort of– she™s 
very lively and very friendly, very outgoing.  Pe
ople can™t believe that she™s eighty-eight years 
old.  There are others like th
at around now, who are eighty-five
 and ninety, who get around and 
I™m hoping I™m still in that, will be in that category.  And I™d like to have  that, I suppose I was 

probably saying I wish I had the time to, since she is
 so interested in traveling right now, that I 
would like to have more of an opportunity to do that
 with her.  Or for the three of us to go, but 
Jean– when you are working, you do it in pieces.  A
nd so my brother and his wife have gone to 
China and so that™s why I went to see her with
 Jean last weekend.  Now we™re trying to plan 
another trip or two.  So I think 
I was just saying, I wish she were
 either down here or– I think 
she™s living in a good situation.  She™s in a high-ris
e for the elderly up in D.C.  But she is very 
dependent on her family, because the people in th
e house, most of them are her age or older.  
Well, they™re about, ma ny of them a r e in their 
eighties and many of them are not in as good a 

physical condition, so she™s always he lping ot hers.  So she hasn™t ma de very ma ny connections 

with people who are her age and want to keep do
ing things, other than come  down to eat and 
ma ybe go shop for groceries.  We  s
ee that and so while she is in a 
mood to want to be able to do 
that, you know, you kind of want to accommodat e  he
r if you can.  But I think between the three 
of us, we can get to do that.  But when you have
 a calendar that is rela
ted to your work, you™re 
limited in that ability.  You want to plan a trip in
 August and Jean™s got to 
start back to school or 
some thing.  You can™t just pick up and go as eas
ily as if you were not working at all.   
 

Q: Has she or have you had any in
terest in visiting, I know you™ve 
been back to Magdeburg, but you 
me ntioned it was more of a sightseeing trip.  Ha
ve you had any strong inte
rest in doing a more 
investigative trip?  Maybe going to 
Leer where your father wa s born?

A: I™d like to go to Leer, actually Jean and her 
mother went to Leer, years ago, when they drove 
through.  There™s a, I have a film at home . 
 Do you speak German?   By a German, by a 
filmmaker, whose name  I™ve forgotten at the mo me nt
, that I justŠMother hasn™t seen it.  I  was 
surprised.  I ma de a copy for herŠof a hom
ecomi ng to Leer by me mbers of the Jewish 
congregation.  You know ma ny of t he German 
c o mmunities have sort of welcomed back 
me mbers of the Jewish community, who lived there and who emigrated because of the 
Holocaust.  And there is this group that came back 
to Leer.  And there™s a film about that group.  
Now there were no relatives of mi ne in that that
 I know of.  But I would 
be interested, actually 
when we we re in Wa shington last time 
and my mother, I was looking for the phone book 

actually, which is in a closet.  
And it was sitting on a 
little book that, I can™
t  r e me mb e r  t h e  n a me ,  
in German.  It was a German recipe book, in wh
ich you wrote recipes and Mother had kept it.  
And there was a folded up piece of pa per in there 
and it was a letterhead of my grandfather, of 
my father™s father, Meir Rosenberg, who wa
s a junk dealer, who, unfortunately committed 
suicide when my father was very small.  Killed 
hi mself.  But it was his 
letterhead, on which my 
mother had written a recipe.  And she didn™t even
 know she had it, I just 
happened to unfold that 
piece of pape r.  And the recipe  is just some th
ing she™d been– wrote in like a little notebook.  

But it covered ma ny yea r s.  It was like she starte
d it when she was a new bride.  It was actually 
bought for her when she was going off on this trip as
 a young girl, when they sent her off to learn 
to cook, to a pension that was near Frankfurt, wh
ich didn™t work out.  So she brought it back and 
started writing.  And it begins in German.  I think 
over at the end some of 
the recipes are actually 
in English in this country. 
 But she had that thing from 
Meir Rosenberg, which I don™t know 
where that came from.  And my father, of course
, was in a school, in an orphanage in Hanover.  
And I™ve never, because when his father di ed af
ter a few years during the 
Depression, there were 
nine kids at home  and 
so his mother just physically, could 
not economically take care of them 
and she sent three of them off to an orphanage
 in Hanover.  I™ve never looked into, I don™t know 

much about that period.  And his brothers and sist
ers, of course, are dead.  I think one of his 
sisters, who is now dead, who went to Israel, did 
go back to Leer and sort
 of close the chapter on 
that.  And I don™t know the business, you know, went out.  We did go to Mother™s home .  I think 

I ma y have me ntioned.  The butcher shop and th
e house where she lived was torn, was no longer 

there.  The houses on either side of the house– wh
ich I suspect is due to th
e fact that her dad ran 
a butcher shop and they slaughtered animals.  And 
when he went into the, when they left in 1936 
and it was taken over, they con
tinued using it as a butcher shop 
and I think it probably just 
rotted.  Because of its use a
nd constantly having water and bl
ood and other– being used as a 
ma nufacturing facility, pr obably just, you know
, decayed.  But we met a number of her 
contemporaries in that town.  Th
ere™s still a club of her schoolma te
s.  I may have mentioned that 
the first time around.  I don™t reme mber. 
 

Q: Yeah, you did, yeah.   

 

A: So, you know I have some  interest.  I don™t know 
that I feel like a genealogist.  We  do have a 
fa mily tree at home, whi c h one of the distant rela
tives in Norfolk Virginia did, which identified a 
number of people who are related, that I didn™t know, some  of whom 
we now know.  And my 
brother did a fa mily tree that goes back pretty far 
on my mother™s side.  And there are a lot of her 
relatives are in the Chicago area.  And cousins 
and cousins I™ve never met, some of whom I™ve 

talked to.  Magdeburg, I thought 
was interesting.  Berlin is– I mean in a way, to me , the 
attraction to Germany is that I know the language
 and when you are there, you know that there™s 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
122
 
 
 
122
this, because of the language,
 that sounds like a language
 you know or that you know the 
nuances, even if it™s your– fourth or fifth grade, 
that there™s very little language barrier.  The 
language br ings with it a fa miliarity.  Not that it™
s home , but it™s like home.  That this is a place 
you™re from.  And it doesn™t evoke all that hostility 
in me  now, thirty years later.  And I would be 
interested in whether the Jewish community, 
the Jewish community in Magdeburg and a number 
of the urban areas is growing agai
n, not huge, but is growing.  And Be
rlin is an exciting city.  I 
think more from a tourist standpoi
nt, wonderful museums and they 
are the parts of Germany I™d 
like to go see.  But I don™t know
 that I would spend a lot of time  trying to dig out more 
information.  It™s interesting, when I saw that. 
 And last time I was up there I saw– and I now 
have, or I came  across my fathe
r™s, the certificate that released 
him from the concentration camp, 
which you™ve seen copies of, I™m sur e , other copies
 of.  And that sort of
 thing.  I think they™re 
very significant.  And I think Mi
chael, our children are interested 
in this history.  How much of 
it– and they are some what conversant with it.  
Well, I don™t guess either one of them have been 
back through this, I would–  I™m just as intere
sted in taking them to England, where I spent 
quite a bit of time in the Service.  But I think both 
of them pr obably want to 
sort of look at this in 
their own way.   
 
Q: Have they asked you and did they ask you mu
ch as they were growing up about what you 
reme mbered about your early year
s before you left Europe?    
 

A: Oh yeah, I think both of them have.  At vari
ous time s we™ve talked about the history and then 
they™ve read about things that
 I™ve wr itten obviously.  They™ve read my talks.  And they™ve 

heard, both of them have talked
 a good bit with their grandmot
her.  And I think they™re both 
cognizant of the effect it™s had on 
the fa mily.  That it is an impor
tant part of our history.  It 
would be nice to, I don™t know if we
™d ever have the time  to re-do it all, but neither one of them 
have been to Europe yet. 
 I hope they go.  We ™ll see. 
 

Q: I™m wondering about, I™ve been trying to kind 
of fra me a big, biggish question for a while.  
Maybe it™s not a question, ma ybe it™s just an obs
ervation, but you™ve, in yo
ur work have kind of 
devoted yourself to people who, really you natura
lly don™t share a whole lot in common with, I 
mean as far as your own background and your own 
tradition.  And in some  ways that™s why– 
because those people were separated fr om ma
instream culture and because they were 
disadvantaged in various ways, th
at™s why you felt the need to work
 with them.  But yet it seems 
that your own tradition as a Jew a
nd as a refugee from Nazi Germany has been an important part 

of your identity.  I kind of wonder 
how you™ve kept that connection 
with your roots and with that 

tradition alive and whether that™s 
been a difficult balance for you in
 a context that™s so separate 
from it.  I think so ma ny Jews and in particul
ar so ma ny refugees, so ma ny survivors have felt 
the need to be among pe ople who really unders
tand what they™ve been through and who had 
experienced something similar to what they™d experienced.   
 

A: Well, I don™t know.  I think some  people just fe
el the need to continue to– I mean I think you 
have stated it, that there are peop
le who want to be in an atmo sphe
re where they think others are, 
that only people who have been 
through some thing like that or cl
ose to it, can understand them.  
Maybe it™s just like our veterans
 or sometimes they™re the same thing.  I mean, I™ve appreciated 
being in Eastern Kentucky very muc h, in terms of 
also learning about this culture and its history.

A: I™ve always liked being in smaller towns.  Just
 the trusting nature of 
people who are in smaller 
communities, whether it™s Gastonia 
or whether it™s rural people generally.  And people who, we 
used to, I used to say when I worked sell
ing chemicals up North it™s– again you never, you 
always wonder about generalizing, but it™s like 
when you™re a salesperson, if you walk into a 
place in the South, people assume that they 
can trust you until you prove that you are not 
trustworthy and do some thing wrong.  And then you
™re done for.  As opposed to going into ma ny 

of the urban places where one mi ght think that, 
they begin by thinking they can™t trust you and 
that you™re going to pull one over 
on them.  And i t  takes a long time to have them either trust you 
or have some confidence in you.  That™s probably, you know, it ma y be that that™s old hat.  I 

think there™s still a lot of that 
here.  And that that™s just sort
 of being country people.  I don™t 
know, in terms of not having that mu ch of a surro
unding, ma ybe part of that ma y be the fact that 
I™m married to a Quaker.  I mean I did not ma
rry some one who is Jewish.  And we accommodate 
that to the wa y we want to, and once you– so you 
ma ke somewhat of a break from the tradition 
that permeates the homes of Jewish couples a
nd fa milies where both couples are Jewi sh.  So, 
Jean is, obviously gave up some  of her ties to being in a Quaker environment where she was a 

very much involved in young Friends activities 
and probably never foresaw that she would be 
ma rried to some body who was Jewish, although Qu
akers are very, probably the most tolerant 
group, religious group that is out th
ere.  So ma ybe that has some thing to do with it.  You know, I 
can never look into some body else
™s brain and I don™t know what 
motivates people, why people 
happen to be narrow-mi nded or not narrow mi
nded, or what–  You know, there are great 
differences among Jews , as you were saying at 
lunch, in the way, in the philosophy of the 
Holocaust Museum and how it should be run.  I have
, my mother™s sister, at least one if not both 
of them, but one of them for cer
tain, would say she would never st
ep foot into Germany again.  I 
mean there are many Jews who came from there, w
ho think it™s heretical to go back to Germany 
and would never forgive anybody and would draw th
e line in the sand.  Whereas Mom went back 
and would go and continue to have some  corre
spondence with people.  And they were very 
touched to see her and she was touched to see pe
ople she we nt to school with.  My ties, and you 
know I still have very good frie
nds who I went to school with 
in North Carolina and Gastonia 
and that sort of thing and in the 
Service.  I think it™s all, I guess 
it™s one huma nity. 
 I mean I think 
you just, you kind of try to get the most out of
 what you can, wherever you happen to be.  And 
that has been pretty, I think that 
in terms of relationships here hasn
™t been that ha
rd.  I think the 
most difficult, the big difficulty is that, one difficu
lty is that most of us 
who are professionals in 
legal services or in others, who are in a helping 
profession or if that™s th
e way we choose to live 
our lives, in a sense we live a pretty, we liv
e, really, a mi ddle-cl
ass life with our own 
surroundings.  And we have most of what we 
need.  We  are not disadvantaged the way our 
clients are disadvantaged.  On the other hand, our
 value systems are totally different from our 
counterparts in private practice or
 in the business community.  So
 we don™t share a lot of their 
values.  And so you have to kind of ma ke your ow
n life and if you need a lot of friends in the 
community that ma y be difficult.  And I think to
 some  extent that™s why you have turnover in 
communities.  Or because you become  absorbed in your own world and you do stay so busy and 

you do enjoy the work that you do, that that takes 
up a lot of your time.  Which is some  of, I 
think, the kinds of stuff t hat Jean and I keep goi
ng, that keeps us going.  
Whereas in a place like 
Washington, even  if you™re working all the ti
me, you™re– and legal serv
ices is probably that 
way, you™re socializing and working with the 
same group of people, because you™re always 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
125
 
 
 
125
together.  And so you don™t really 
need a lot of outside help.  I 
think that™s– and that™s why I 
said earlier, the school, I think when your kids 
start to school, you start to
 develop mu ch more of 
a base in the community and you me e t  parents.  Maybe even socially your friends become , at 
least for a few years, the parents who have 
kids in schools like you 
do.  And that social 
engagement helps to, I think, draw
 you into the community and st
art thinking about
 things like a 
Science Cent er.  I mean the first ten or  fifteen
 years I was here, the id
ea of, you™re just going 
uphill all the time.  And even the 
idea that, that you mi ght be working together with the business 
community.  I mean whe n I was filing these coalcases, the very notion of
 trying to seek funding, 
from say the coal council that™s given the Scien
ce Center some  money to design coal exhibits.  I 

would have said, ﬁWe can™t do that.ﬂ  We  had 
a big debate, I was on a Bar committee that was 
doing a booklet for the elderly, health care for the 
elderly and rights of th
e elderly.  And whether 
we should get money, accept money from Huma na, b
ecause we were suing Humana.  I said, ﬁI 
don™t want any of Huma na™s money.ﬂ  We ll, we
 eventually took Huma na™s money and gave 
them a, I can™t reme mbe r .  The other committee me mbers said, ﬁLet™s get the money, don™t 

worry about it and gi ve them a little acknowledgem
ent.  You can sue them.  Let™s get their 
money.™ 
 

Q: Get their mo ney twice. 

 

A: Right, get their money twice.  Those are philoso
phical issues that are ha
rd to grapple with.  
That™s why I say, now that I™m sharing a grant with 
a judge.  I sued that judge, ten years ago in a 

strip mi ning case, he was in the Service.  And 
we™ve had a couple of knock-downs, but he wants, 

he™s very– I think he, you know, 
he™s like a lot of ot
her political figures, but he came up the 
hard way and he wants to see this be a better pla
ce to live.  And he™s willing to invest his time to 
try to improve housing and clean up garbage and do th
ings that bring in i
ndustry.  And as long as 
we don™t bump into each other ove
r other things, I think that™s 
a good thing to do.  And so those 
are the kind of things that help ma ke being in
 the community more, wh
en you start thinking well 
ma ybe we can do things with others and ma kethis a better place for everybody, even if we have 

to step on some toes.  The problem in agencies like these is the temptation with many agencies, 

of course, especially state, to jump over, it™s
 too easy to get co-opte
d.  And so you, as you were 
talking about, the problem in the mu seum or
 any institution, if you start becomi ng cautious 
because you™re afraid some body™s going to cut your money off, or you™re going to lose your job 

or some thing is going to happen, then you lose the e
ffectiveness.  And I think we™ve been able to 
avoid that, I think, pretty well. 
 I think people know, have known me
, that I don™t want to get into 
that position.  And the people on 
both sides of the fence, that I™m
 not going to do that.  If I did 
that, I™d stop one or the other. 
 That I think that– it doesn™t m
ean that you can™t compr o mi se.  
But it is, you get put into those positions and 
that™s hard, especially
 when you have funding 
sources that are problematical.  I 
mean, that™s hard.  Like the mi grant cases, when we had some  

publicity in one of the migrant cas
es that we filed and people went
 screaming to Congress.  My 
counterparts are worried we™re going 
to lose the money in the Stat
e Legislature if they find out 
legal services is involved
 in this case.  That kind of stuff can
 be really hard, and you just try your 
best to get through it.  But I™m pretty pleased with where we™ve come .  I hope whoever takes 

over will keep it going that way.  Most of the 
people who run my offices, I think, have that 
philosophy.  I can™t reme mber what you asked. 
 

Q: Oh, it was a while ago, it was that
 big, that big kind of question. 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007
  
 
126
 
 
 
126
 
A: Did we ever talk about the end?   Did I 
ever give you the answer to the big question? 
 

Q: Well, I think you addressed it, yeah.   

 

A: Oh, you asked about the identity thing. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: You know I don™t know, some ti me s it™s hard to
 know, to answer.  And you can go on and the 
reality is you don™t really know the answer. 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: You just have some  ideas. 

 

Q: The questions are just kind of little ways of ge
tting you to talk about things anyway.  (Laughing.)  
They™re not necessarily to 
find out the answers.   
 

A: You™re wonderful at pricking, at getting so
me body started.  And I can 
begin to see why some  
people, why some one like yourself does so well.  I m
ean this must be hard just to listen to folks 
go on, but you can see why some  folks start writing 
books collaboratively and are willing to just 

sort of, finally you turn it all over.  Sa y, 
ﬁWell, just ask me  and I™ll talk a while.™ 
 

Q: People like me  love listening to
 stories, it™s fun.  (Laughing.) 
 
A: One thing I™m not good at is, I don™t have ma ny 
s t ories.  I know there are people who can tell 
them.  Jean™s father is a marvel
ous storyteller and he™s ninety-tw
o.  And he reme mbers jokes.  I 
mean hundr eds of jokes.  And I try to get him,
 have gotten him to put some  down on his 
computer or to type them up.  Because he, J
ean knows, has heard ma ny of them.  But it™s 
amazing.  And I cannot reme mber a joke five mi nute
s.  I™ll hear one and think it™s wonderful.  
Boy that will be easy.  I won™t forget that.  
I can™t even reme mber the punch– it just does not 
stay with me . 
 

Q: I think you underestimate yourself, because you™ve 
told a lot of stories in this– I mean, we™ve 
got ten tapes full of– 
 

A: Ofsome thing! 

 

Q: Is there anything you want to say to close the interview?  

 

A: To the world?   To the world? 

 

Q: Here™s your chance.  (Laughing.)

A: I don™t know.  I think give Arwen Donahue an
 award for having listene
d to all these hours of 
going on.  I don™t know that there™s much more to a
dd.  I feel very lucky.  I mean I guess I  just 
would say whoever, if you think 
back on the fact that I was born into a Germany– I  think that 
my father was in a concentration camp.  If you th
ink back on all the experiences that I™ve had, 
I™ve been a pretty fortunate pe
rson to have been through all th
ese various experiences and to 
have people appreciate them and to be where 
we are today and to have so ma ny diffe rent 
connections.  I think one of the nice things that Jean and I™ve been able, have had a nice 
opportunity to do is just, we talk about Sherry 
Arms today.  There™s so ma ny of those people, 
either in the Service or  in the law, because she™
s in the work that she™s in and because of our 
interest in education, we™ve just me t so ma ny pe
ople across the state.  And have had a chance– 
and if it wasn™t education, it™s th
e people, those couples she taught 
childbirth to, because ma ny of 
those kids are growing up now.  Whe n you go to
 the grocery store and they say, ﬁLook Jean, 
that™s my twenty– see that, he™s 
that baby!ﬂ  And here™s this guy a
bout six feet three inches tall.  
And you see all these, you know, you kind of 
look around you and you say, well, you™ve had a 
little opportunity to do some th
ing that ma de a difference over time.  I me an it™s not over yet.  It™s 
not an epitaph. 
 

Q: I don™t know if you™ll ever have
 one.  You just keep going. 
 

A: Well, people are getting older 
these days, aren™t they?   What
 is the oldest person you™ve 
interviewed? 
 

Q: That™s a good question, probably 
ninety.  There™s  a, I don™t k
now, have you heard the things on 
NPR?   The Hundred Years of Stories?   A fr
iend of mi ne, who™s producing these.  I won™t 
transcribe it. 
 
A: One of these involved– 
 

Q: Why don™t you repeat that you are going to talk a
bout a couple of cases, b
ecause I didn™t get that 
part either. 
 

A: Yeah, I was just going to tell you about a coupl
e of– when you said is 
there anything else and 
then we started talking about stor
ies.  And I said I didn™t really 
do very well with stories, which I 
don™t.  I™m not a storyteller.  But I thought I 
mi ght me ntion a couple of 
experiences, just about 
legal cases that I was involved with
 that I don™t know that I™ve me n
tioned.  The first one is one in 
the early ‚70s or in the early ‚
70s that involved the Paintsville H
ousing Authority.  A family, part 
Indian, name d Elsie, the father 
was name d Elsie Dale.  They lived
 in a shack, in an old house and 
their house burned down.  And so he applied to ge
t into public housing and 
they wouldn™t let him 
in.  So, I went over there and when I got there El
sie had taken some  of the charred timbers that 
were left and put them up against an old automobile
, his car.  And the fa mily was living there.  
And they applied for public housing and they woul
dn™t let them in.  The y wouldn™t let them in 
because the community treated them as black, not 
as– I mean Indian.  They were dark-skinned.  
But they were very poor.  And so we went to 
the Housing Authority.  We
 started investigating.  
And it turned out that the Housing Authority ha
d also threatened to kick out some  unwed 
mothers.  And then there was a guy name d, what 
was this fellow™s name ?   He was a veteran.  A 
single father.  They didn™t want 
him to– he wanted to get in with
 his child.  They didn™t want 

      
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007

128
him in.  The  woma n who was running the place,
 Maxine some body, wa s very– she let you in if 
she knew you.  It was who you knew.  There was nothing fa ir about the system and she just 
didn™t want them in the project.  So, we filed a laws
uit.  It was one of the first large cases that we 
had filed.  And on the way up there, I had to get, 
we had a hearing, we were
 to have a hearing in 
Lexington for preliminary injunction.  And we were
 trying to get the witnesses together.  And 
that night I was going to pick up 
the fellow who was the veteran.  A
nd I couldn™t.  He wasn™t at 
home .  And I finally found him 
and he was drunk.  And I had to get him up there.  And so I 
fi nally got hi m in my car, and we got as far as 
Salyersville and I filled up the gas tank.  And he 
was riding with me .  And he wanted, as we were 
leaving the gas station, he wanted to get out.  
And he was– what did he want to do?  He st arted 
to hit me .  I threw hot water in hi s face.  Oh, I 
threw my coffee at him.  And I reme mber the coff
ee spot stayed on the side of the car.  So, we 
then drove, we started dr iving, I had this old Pe
ugeot in 1970, because Jean and I had bought it to 
take a campi ng trip.  We  brought it to drive downhere.  We  had a ‚59 Volvo and we had this old 

Peugeot.  And we had like a ‚62 or ‚66 Peugeot
, which we had taken on our camping trip.  So, 
we got halfway to Lexington and I started having 
car trouble.  I got out 
of the car to look under 
the hood.  And my witness, who was still partially 
drunk, then locked me  out of the car.  And the 

stars were out.  I reme mber, it was a beautiful ni
ght.  He wouldn™t let me  back in.  Wha t  was his 
name ?   Elvin– Anywa y, I bet I was out of the car fo
r about half an hour.  He finally let me  in.  
We got into Lexington about 1:30 in
 the morning.  Next morning he was sober, and he got on the 

stand and he was a very, very good witness.  And I 
had a blow-up of this big automobile with the 
timbers and Elsie Dale got on and testified.  He ha
d four kids.  He needed a four-bedroom unit.  
And the clerk of the court started 
crying.  I mean it was so sad, they wouldn™t let him in.  But the 
judge would not order the Housing 
Authority to let them in.  He 
said I could try to prove that 
there was further discrimi nation and as it turned
 out that day– And the unwed mothers, Effie 
Pickelsheimer was her name .  She testified.  
We  put on a strong case, but the judge was not 
going to do anything that day.  So anyway we came
 back.  But I always reme mber throwing this 
coffee.  Thirty years later.  What was  his name ?  
 He had a short, fat– he eventually, the same  
person was indicted because he shot a guy in the 
back, who had started a fight with him.  And I 
went to visit him in the jail about twenty years 
later after that particular– Crum was his second 
name .  It wasn™t Elvin Crum, wh
at was his first name ?   We ll, we ended up having a number of 
grievance hearings.  I got the know 
all the tenants in that project.
  This case went on for about 
two years.  In the meantime they were tearing down
 a new section, an old section of Paintsville.  
So we were able for Elsie, he really wanted a ho
use of his own.  And as part of the settleme nt of 
this case we were able to get him a Farm
er™s Home House built by the Co mmunity Action 
Agency.  He never got in the housing project. 
 But they were such a nice family and you knew 
the only reason they didn™t live 
in the project was because they 
were not white.  We did finally 
get a very good, agreed court order 
that required them to set up a very fair system.  And for years 
after that they wouldn™t– anytime there was 
a question about whether 
some body should get in 
or not, they would call me, because they didn™t want
 to go back to cour t.  But it was a case that 
went on forever.  And finally really was resolved 
in a very favorable way for the clients in that 
housing project.  I was thinking, another, when we 
talk about the effect ca
ses have, I represented 
a group over from Pike County, who, they were supposed to strip mi ne above their, they were 

going to strip mi ne this holler 
above their homes  in Poor Bottom off Mar i bone Creek over in 
Pike County.  And the families were worried that
 the strip mi ne was right over their houses and 

that the rocks and boulders were–  So when we l
ooked into it, we learned that there we re deep 
mi ne workings that had been worked out inside
 the mountain and that if they strip mi ned around

the fr ont si de , they were in danger of hitting 
those old deep mi ne workings which were filled 
with water.  And the water would then potentially
 be a real problem to the people down below.  
It just could come  out in gall
ons and wash away houses.  So we
 had a couple of hearings in 
Frankfort and one of the lead plaintiffs wa
s na me d Edith Easterling, who was very mu ch 
involved in the case against the McShurleys, whic
h is when the Appalachian Volunteers were 
here
74
.  I don™t know if you now about that?   There was this series in 
The Ne w Yorker
 about this 
couple that was arrested by the local prosecuto
r.  The case we nt to the House Un-Ame rican 
Activities Co mmittee.  Anyway, Edith™s daught
er was name  Sue Kobak, she™d ma rried a young 
ma n in Wa s hington.  And she was home  and she went
 to the hearings with us.  And they couldn™t 
find, we were the only folks that could represen
t anybody because it would cost a fortune.  There 
were no lawyers around who would re
present this community to try 
to stop the strip mi ning.  It 
had actually already started.  I 
had a wonderful expert, a guy who 
had been an inspector.  And 
she went to the hearings with us.  And I didn™t 
know this until later, 
after she got home , she 
applied to go to law school and went to law sc
hool as a result of seeing this experience.  And 
actually an experience that had a 
favorable outcome.  The admi nist
rative judge said that we were 
right in that they had left, this information a
bout the water in the old workings was not on the 
permit application.  And that he 
considered it to be a danger to 
the family and they stopped the 
strip mi ning operation totally.  Ed
ith Easterling a wonderful pers
on, a remarkable woma n.  And I 
didn™t know until after was in– and Sue went to
 law school and had a difficult time as an 
Appalachian student for a couple 
of years.  She later ma rried 
a doctor in Clintwood and she™s a 
city attorney in Clintw
ood, Virginia.  I was just thinking b
ack about those sorts of human, and 
you become – you were asking me  earlier, you become
 very close to your clients.  She had 
organized that little holler.  A
nd it potentially was a really seri
ous problem.  We did a lot more 
strip mi ning work than we have 
in recent years because some  of the lawyers who worked for us 
are now doing that in private pr
actice.  I just recently represented some body in Letcher County, 
whose name  had been left off, their property had b
een left off a mi ning map.  They just left them 
off because they didn™t– and they knew, they
 knew that she owned the property that they 
wanted to mine and that she wasn™t going to le
t them mi ne.  And so th
ey left, they thought, I 
think, they could get away with 
it by just leaving their name  off 
the ma p, which they are required 
to put on to show the property th
at they intend to mi ne, figuring 
they mi ght just pay her dama ges 
when it was over.  And she was outside, this is
 an older widow, looking up there and saw the 
trees getting cut, comi ng over the hill.  It was one
 of the cases that I di
d.  And then we stopped 
them from going any further and th
e state agreed that they should
 not do that.  So I don™t know, I 
was just thinking back on Elsie Dale and the peop
le you get to meet in these cases, who have to 
be pretty gutsy to stand up against pretty moneyed interests, who pay big bucks for lawyers and 

who hire people in the community, 
who hire their– I think one of
 these folks had a son who was 
a truck driver for the same  company that had mi
ned, that was mi ning that strip mi ne.  You™re 

always running into that, that 
sort of situation.  But in ever
y one of these cases, you know, 
whether it™s in legal services 
or it™s the discrimi nation cases 
like Fannie Lou Ha me r, and the 
people who– Eulah Hall always remi nds me  of, 
you me ntioned Eulah Hall.  You know Eulah 
and I went to Washington together because in th
is health care case.  I don™t know if I me ntioned 
that the first time, when Eulah 
started this clinic and I was te
lling you this morn
ing earlier about 
the medical clinic when they wouldn™t let th
ese folks do this me dical thing.  What happened 
then, we asked for a hearing and she was my witn
ess and I took her to, we went to Wa s hington 
and we had an admi nistrative hearing.  A
nd they came back down here and did a big

investigation and they threatened to close it.  
They ended up reorganizing
 it with a new board of 
directors, and– 
 
Q: They threatened to clos e the clinic? 

 

A: Clinic, yeah.  The clinic, the program that wa
s in be ing, because it wasn™t doing what it was 
supposed to do.  And then so they ended up 
reorganizing that clin
ic with a new board. 
 

Q: The Mud Creek Clinic? 

 

A: Well that™s what turned into
 the Mud Creek Clinic, which is
 now a nationally
-known clinic.  
Back then it was called, yeah, I guess back then 
it was just the Mud Creek Clinic.  There was a 
period of time , it went through several phases,
 where it was called Bi
g Sandy Health Care, 
whatever– back then it was really under the 
Community Action Agency.  But eventually it 
became the Mud Creek Clinic.  Then that clinic
 burned down.  Jean, she got her nursing degree, 
did her internship out there af
ter it had been burned down.  Th
ey put a phone on the telephone 
pole.  And Eulah kept the place going in her house
.  No one believe d she could do it.  In three 
weeks she raised like 200,000 dolla
rs over the telephone.  And this 
was a social worker with a 
fifth-grade education.  And she raised enough money, ma ybe  it wasn™t two hundred, to build a 

new clinic.  And it™s been expande
d several time s since then.  Now 
they have a dental clinic and 
a daycare center and it™s a real
 wonderful institution.  That wasa place, the only place– and a 
good friend of ours became  a doctor there.  That
™s the place where we took our kids.  Now it™s 
run by a federally-funded group called Big Sandy Health Care up here.  They also run a clinic in 

Magoffin County and one in Pike County.  And Eulah 
has stayed right with it.  I me an she™s won 
these wonder woma n awards.  She™s on lots of board
s and lots of committees.  And has just kept  
on, but day to day she™s still the so
cial worker out there.  And she™
s represented people in social 
security and black lung cases, and has really l
earned it.  Recently had 
her picture hung in the 
Capitol in that Wo me n™s Galleria, you know
, one of those, the 
Kentucky Commission on 
Wome n, Wome n of the Year things, 
or whatever they call them.  I™m real proud of her.  I think 
she™s quite a testimonial to what people can do when
 they want to do it.  And she worked with us 
for a few ye ars as an outreach worker with Appa
lred.  So those are the people you come across, 

you know.  Hard to beat, right?  We
l l , I guess we can call it a day. 
 

Q: Okay.  We ll, thanks. 

 

A: Oh, I should also me ntion.  

 

Q: Yeah? 

 

A: Did we ever talk about the Jewish community in Williamson? 

 

Q:  No. 

 

A:  Where we are going to synagogue these days?

Q: You™ve me ntioned, you™ve me ntioned that you– Williamson?   No, I thought you were going to 
synagogue so me where in We st Virginia.  
Is that in West Virginia, Williamson? 
 
A: Virginia.  Well we went to Portsmouth, I mean we went to Lexington and then to Ashland, 
Kentucky for a while.  But then most recently, for the last few years, we™ve been going to a 

small–

Tape 11, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape numb
er eleven, side A. 
 
A: Well, we™re talking about and I was thinking ab
out how you ma intain your Judaism as it were.  A 
few years ago we learned that there was still a 
congregation in Williamson, West Virginia, which 
is about thirty-five miles from here, much clos
er than Lexington and we went over there one 
Friday night.  And found a very friendly group of
 people, who were meeting sort of monthly and 
being served by the rabbi from Huntington, We st
 Virginia, who come s down on a Sunday night 
to do a Friday night service.  And the s
ynagogue is an old, old synagogue.  I don™t know, 
probably a hundred years old at l
east.  It sits up on top of a 
hill in the black section of 
Williamson.  And there™s no elevator and you™ve 
got to walk up a huge bunch of steps, well, 
probably twenty-five.  And the average age of th
e people other than us 
is about seventy.  But 
they™ve kept on going and they consist of fo
lks from We lch and Grundy and nearby people who 
are in a probably twenty, thirty mile area 
from around Williamson.  I think twenty years ago 

during the height of the coal mi ning in this ar
ea and ma ybe through the 
seventies and eighties I 
think they had fifty fa mi lies.  Over the year
s the kids have moved away and so the older 
me mbers of the Williamson Jewish co mmunity are still ther e.  And the President is a fe llow 

name d Bill Rosen, whose son is now a circuit judg
e in Ashland.  But it™s been a nice group of 
people, and the rabbi, who is fr
om Huntington, is an interesting 
personality.  His wife teaches a, 
not Headstart, but Upward Bound program.  And I ™ ve
 actually been– the ra
bbi teaches a class at 
Marshall University on Jewish studies.  And so
 I™ve visited his class and spoke about the 
Holocaust as sort of a living survivor.  But it is 
interesting, and then it™s much nicer to go to a 
congregation of that sort, where every person 
that comes is one more person that makes a 
difference, rather than going to Lexington, where 
you™ve got a large congregation at Adath Israel 
and there™s also the Conservative, the Orthodox congr
egation there.  So, that
™s been very nice.  
We actually have, there are other,
 three other Jewi sh mi xed couples
 here.  Miriam Silman, whose 
father, by the way, had the contract to, was an e
ngineer, who re-did, who did the plans to re-do 
Mount Vernon.  And then Pa m We iner, whose husba
nd is from here, from Pike County, and is a 
Buddhist.  They just had a baby.  And then Deborah
 Golden, who is a lawyer with my Pikeville 
offi ce.  And then ther e is another couple in Pi
ke ville, Terry Mulliken, who™s a lawyer .  His wife , 
Cynthia, has been on my  Board.  It used to be th
ere™s a large family in Pikeville that used to go 
to Williams on, their name  Yaruses.  They™re friends
 of ours.  But they, and they go, now they™re 
older and they go once in a while.  But the Williamson community was sort of the hub of the 

Jewish resi dents of this ar ea for many years. 
 Now there are probably twenty families that are 
left.  One of the younger set ma rried, a young woma n 
married an Israeli when she was in Israel 

and they have a little boy.  They™ve recently b
een divorced.  Ve ry few young me mbers.  But it is 
there and we have, we joined that
 congregation, so that we once agai
n do have a, sort of a for mal 
tie to a Jewish community that ™s here , for what
ever it™s worth.  I guess it™s worth putting that 
down.   
 

Q: Is it a Conservative? 

 

A: It™s Reform.  Now the congregation the rabbi
 is from in Huntington, you had a Reform and an 
Orthodox congregation me rge.  Really
 unusual.  And so it™s sort of conservative.  And I think he 
actually has, for the benefit of
 the Orthodox me mbers, he has services on Saturday morning as

well.  He™s a very funny fellow, almo st like a stand-up comi c when he does sermons.  Because 
he™ll say some thing very serious and then it 
will jog his mi nd to kind of say some thing funny, 
remi nds him of some thing funny.  But he™s a verybright fellow.  It™s a 
nice group.  I mean, it™s 
obviously an older group and they depend on one or
 two people like the Rosens and one or two 
other families to sort of keep it going.  You know, once they got the air conditioni ng– I don™t 

know how ma ny more years they can do that.  Th
ere™s not a very strong base down below.  

Some one did a series in West Virginia
, I think it ma y have even been in 
The New York Times
, an 
article on old congregations.  And some one did a 
project in Ke ntucky, didn™t they?   On Jewish 
synagogues in Kentucky, a few years ago? 
 

Q: Yeah.  Lee Shai We issbach did a book on syna
gogues of Kentucky.  He™s at the University of 
Louisville. 
 

A: Well, the one in Ashland is, I don™t know what they
 turned it into, a day care
 center.  We used to 
go there for the first few years we were here.  In
 fact I had a fraternity brother at Duke, whose 
father, who was Jewish, whose father was the ma yor
 of Ashland back in the ‚50s, and he™s now 
down in Florida.  And then they gave that up. 
 And I think people either we nt to Portsmouth, 

about thirty or forty miles north, 
or to Huntington.  That congrega
tion folded.  And then we went 
to Lexington for high Holy days.  We never r
eally, I was never, didn™t know ma ny pe ople and 
we were up there for Seder a couple of nights, 
but you never felt much a part of it.  You know 
what I mean? 
 

Q: Yeah.  So, Jean™s taken, has Jean 
taken a strong interest in Judaism?  

 

A: Oh yeah, I mean, I think, we often go Friday ni
ghts.  She goes with me .  She™s always supported 
that.  Doesn™t know any more, doesn™t know a lot 
of Hebrew.  But we also now have Quakers, 
we have a Quaker group in Eastern Kentucky, whic
h is a very small Quaker group, she ma y have 
me ntioned to you. 
 

Q: Yeah, and I think you actual
ly talked about the Quaker 
group a little bit in the last– 
 

A: We go there on weekends.  I don™t think tomorrow,
 I don™t think it™s this 
weekend.  I think it™s 
next weekend, but three or four couples.  They™r
e awfully nice.  But she, some one was saying the 
other day– If you ask Michael, I guess ma ybe both 
kids sort of consider themselves Jewish.  
Not that they observe or are really close to th
e synagogues.  When Jean told me  that about Ann 
Louise, I was a little surprised, but 
I think that™s what she says.  Wh
ether that will alwa ys be that 
way, I think they do associate more
 with us, rather than the Jewi
sh community at  large.  All 
right.   
 

Q: Okay.  This is it. 

 

A:  Now I interview you. 

 

Q:  My turn.  Well, I was born– no, 
we™re not going to do this today.
